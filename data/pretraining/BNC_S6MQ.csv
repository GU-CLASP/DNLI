B	I don't know why she ever buys them cos they're always too horrid to send
B	I don't think she did either
C	well I know everyone thinks differently but my mentality would be

A	have you got a
C	not to think

B	what did you look for? well cos er it
A	oh I put

B	that
A	lots of ones in this country for you know six and seven pounds
B	what did you pay post and packing?

B	yeah
A	and er
B	that's ridiculous
C	yeah but you know why?
B	yeah
A	well the same ones that you buy for five ninety-nine over here it's just they've added five pounds eighty-nine to the price

A	you could have phoned me I wouldn't have minded that
B	oh well I'm going going I'll get some from Tesco's on the
C	yeah but dad when I said did you get any cheese? you went no well what you could have done was got in the car gone up the road and bought some cheese
B	I think I'm gonna put some makeup on
C	but the thing is as mum says you have appointed yourself as the house shopper so
A	mm I know I don't mind being the house shopper
B	did you close the window in
C	yes
B	I'm glad no one in this family takes sugar anymore it's a bind getting sugar out when people take sugar
C	oh I hate I
B	mm
C	the first year she took sugar and it was such a bore in her tea
B	how did you convert her?
C	I just said
B	mm
C	making her tea after that cos I could just
B	I know
C	do the teabag and the milk
B	I looked all through there and I looked all through here though
A	I have seen it
B	well it was up there on the side
A	yeah so
B	for a while
A	you know probably
C	we always used to drink tea to procrastinate
B	oh you and I do that all the time
C	yeah we'd
B	when I have my week off in my two weeks off in March I have got to do my spring cleaning last year I wasted it wasted it because you were home and we procrastinated drinking coffee all
C	I wasn't home in March
B	no I did it February last year and you were home for half term I think from
C	oh
B	school
C	yeah
B	so this year I've got to do it
C	why do you only clean once a year?
B	I don't only clean once a year
B	I have a thorough thorough clean right through I clean everything every single thing and I go on the top of all the cupboards I
C	mm
B	scrub down all the doorframes
C	what are you looking for?
B	that card for
C	you're never gonna find it
B	it's a black and white card and with a man wearing a coloured
C	I know I've seen it
B	tank top
A	we've all seen it
C	mm
B	they were rubbish eggs
C	blame
A	that's er chicken pies is
B	they were really nice
A	yeah she wasn't putting them in the reduced bit on the reduced bit she was putting it on the
B	right
A	for tomorrow
B	oh
A	yeah
A	yeah I thought two quid twenty-five P that's not very good
C	so it's not really about the money you
B	yeah it's like a little
A	mm
B	addiction isn't it?
C	so you don't you're not actually saving
A	so I bought four of them
C	but you wouldn't have done if they'd been two pounds to begin with?
A	no
A	no I would have thought they're not worth it
B	oh can you put my phone back on charge? sorry it's going down quickly that's all
C	well yes my shoes
B	oh you have to you'll have to flick the thing off
A	and it's
C	that
B	that's a bargain
C	yeah
B	they must be quite good quality are they suede?
C	I think so they're some kind of
B	have to be careful in wet weather then
C	yeah
B	they'll get all marked and horrible
A	yours are torn
C	yeah cos dad I got a hole
A	I can't put that in
B	they
A	I can't put it on the
B	they were full of holes anyway
A	there you are
C	no not not those ones the ones that didn't have holes they were they were the ones that didn't have holes
B	oh
C	to just wear long jumpers and cover it up
B	oh
C	cos I didn't have any other jeans
A	oh that's nice that you can touch it and not just
B	yeah can you bring down that battery charger that you stole?
C	no it's there now it's there back there
B	oh okay so where's the white one then?
C	I don't know about the white one I haven't stolen the white one
A	what white one?
C	what are you on about?
A	there's one there
B	yeah there was a white one I I plugged in by the armchair I plugged a white one in by the armchair
C	I haven't got that one
B	there's still one missing though one black one missing
C	don't blame me for everything that goes wrong in your life
B	oh I didn't mean to I think you did when
C	no I didn't cos it had been recording since then
B	oh well I didn't
C	you did didn't you just now why?
A	oh are you recording?
C	yeah
A	oh I didn't know
B	did what did
C	he said that's fine he said you probably won't get much out of
B	I know never tell people when you're recording
C	well I've got to get them to sign the consent forms
B	well yes but then just say
C	I know he said he said
B	and forgotten
C	yeah that it's fine he said just don't let us know when you begin
B	yeah
C	and then that's fine
B	yeah no it is it does make you feel a bit self conscious when you realise the that's why I can never understand why in the Big Brother house they say oh I forget the cameras are there
C	well I guess you would after a while wouldn't you?
A	yeah yeah
B	would you? cos I at work I'm always aware
C	mm
B	and always erm I'll think right
A	so do you walk like?
B	yeah so I walk like that and looking around and
B	mm
A	mm that looks like a marching princess
C	why did they install cameras there was there
A	yeah
B	well yeah there was there was a break in at the lodge cos the office the administrative office is at the lodge
A	mm yeah
B	but it was someone who knew someone who worked there but it came round to the back of our building and nicked some
A	mm
B	like that are stored round the back which I didn't hear them
A	mm
B	and they went down to the lodge and they broke into the office and went straight for the safe
C	did they actually take the money out?
B	yeah
C	so they knew the code and everything?
B	yeah well I don't know I don't know how they broke into the safe
C	oh no
B	and after that I mean those cameras they're pretty state of the art they must have cost an absolute
A	mm
B	fortune and they're all around and there's nowhere
A	mm
B	on the outside perimeter of any part of the building that you can go
A	mm
B	where you're not seen on camera
A	dimmer monitors?
C	did you get called in for questioning? did you get
B	no
C	suspected?
B	no they never asked me anything
C	oh that's a bit strange I would have asked you
B	well they sort of said oh did you hear anything last night you know? and that sort of thing
C	but did they not kind of say
B	no
C	where the safe was
B	where the safe was and
C	was there no one on the night shift at the lodge?
B	yeah yeah but it's sort of a little bit
C	oh so it's a bit away from everything
B	and it's up a separate it's a separate staircase and everything yeah it's
C	it's a way for you to walk
B	it's like a little self-contained flat the office
C	mm
B	well yeah it could have been
A	where?
B	at the lodge at the house
A	who did?
B	do you know it was a girl I used to work with I can't remember what her name
C	what are you doing?
A	I'll just kill myself won't be long
C	well why?
B	I can't remember her name now cos I didn't well she didn't work there terribly long I got on with her alright she was okay and then her car not when on my night I was on with her the next night her car was nicked from the carpark
C	so she didn't seem like oh my god my car's gone missing
B	well I wasn't there when she actually had it stolen but
A	what's her name?
B	I can't remember I didn't
A	why?
B	I dunno
A	got sacked for nicking cars?
C	probably
B	I don't know
C	oh dad you did you do that? did you really need to soak the beans?
B	you do need to soak things like that
C	otherwise that that has to soak for like a day now cos that's all day day
B	not a day

A	a Corpus Christi
C	in order to work out how people use language
A	ah yes

B	so what what what what does it achieve knowing all this?
C	it's er it's discovering how people use language so it's so it might be different in different areas it might be different depending on how where people come from there's like national statistics and regional statistics
A	statistics isn't it? yes
C	and it's erm it's it's studying how people use languages and then you can compare different languages and
A	yeah it's a progression of the human race
