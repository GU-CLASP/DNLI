B	oh when's it cold enough for ties?
A	I'm only wearing my jacket because I it's windy
B	this is why I like winter
A	but it's still quite warm I've actually been sweating
B	see I do like having four seasons otherwise you'd never wear a tie would you?
A	no
B	do you want some new ties this year?
A	I dunno I only like plain ties
B	okay
A	don't like patterned ones
B	okay
A	but I need another jacket
B	yeah

A	yeah fair enough
B	if he went slower with all those paint buckets piled up on his motorbike
B	er yes yes
A	yeah it's a piece of piss isn't it? mm
B	yes cos er most of the it's only a fifty minute class and it's mostly discussion
A	yeah yeah
B	so there's just that bit of pronunciation
A	yeah
B	I'm not very good at doing erm like stopping the flow I find that
A	stress syllables well maybe start with that or
B	I can't because I always start with them getting their homework out and discussing articles to get the energy pumping around the class
A	finish with it
A	what do you do to your class? oh mine mine are just
B	what do you mean? it's
A	yeah but mine

A	oh you do that do you?
B	yeah oh man I can't stand I can't stand this kind of teaching I just can't I just can't let them
B	they probably get really frustrated with me because after twenty minutes of them doing some solid work on their own I'm like oh god I can't I just can't sit here any longer let's do let's
B	talk about it
A	it is university
B	yeah well they're doing fine we're getting through the work so it's my style ain't it? everybody's got their own style
