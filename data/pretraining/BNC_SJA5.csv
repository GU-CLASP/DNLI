B	so
C	the one that doesn't want to get bullied is to a
A	you know like Crabbe and Goyle with Malfoy?
B	yeah
A	okay

A	yeah
C	mm and she gets hurt because he scratched her on the cheek and
B	yeah but
C	but and he didn't know that he didn't get them cos the bunny is really clever because she actually got the tickets without
B	then
C	and then
B	and
C	yeah
A	okay
C	so
A	what did he take instead then?
C	nothing
B	nothing
A	mm
B	he didn't get anything out of doing that so for hurting her
A	so he was
C	yeah

B	the
A	okay
C	yeah so
A	she's going to move into Zootropolis?
C	yeah

C	and the bunny's on the case of a missing mammal
A	sorry? say that again
C	all the missing mammals are
A	oh
C	predators
A	oh
B	and the missing mammal she's after is an otter named Emmitt
A	okay now is it unusual for foxes and rabbits to be friends in this
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	okay
B	because they all in that film foxes are they're kind of looked at as sly people that you shouldn't trust but he's
A	and and you don't see the guy the
B	you do
A	you do
B	he becomes friends with her parents and becomes with the bunny's parents
A	is he really a friend to them?
B	yeah

B	and er
A	oh
C	yeah
A	okay yeah so they're looking out for an otter

C	yeah they go missing when they turn savage because there's an
B	is friends with well
B	yeah kind of friends and she'd actually the person behind this she's
C	can I say the rest?
B	because
B	yeah she gets these flowers called purple devil or just devils?
C	they're called Night Howlers
B	oh yeah Night Howlers
A	mm?
B	and then she puts them in things that look like blueberries and then she shoots them and when it explodes on someone's neck
A	uhu
B	it's like made out
A	mm
B	they live in a
A	oh
B	and a famous singer called Gazelle in that
A	uhu
B	who is actually a gazelle
A	uhu
B	so the joke erm says in that she that's not the Zootropolis she knows when predators are now afraid of prey even when they're completely harmless
A	mm
B	and then the
C	oh prey
A	are are afraid of
C	are are afraid of predators
A	predators

B	the
A	he was covering them up then? he was sort of
B	yeah
A	taking them and keeping them while
B	yeah
A	they were being
B	savage
A	savage
B	yeah cos
A	and what happened when they stopped being savage?
C	erm well it's
B	well that was at the end when she was erm
A	so is they
B	when
A	mm
C	yeah but
A	hang on
C	before that
A	that was at the end when she
C	when she saved them all
B	well the
A	when she
B	the lamb
C	she saved
A	when she saved them all so were they still behaving
C	when the lamb was captured
A	how did she stop them behaving like savages then?
C	because
B	oh their
C	the thing that made them savage turned them not savage so the flower smell
A	yeah
C	so and I'll tell you the rest so
A	uhu
B	yeah they
A	mm
B	and then when a blueberry hit the fox she pretended to go savage and they were doing really good acting
A	uhu
C	yeah
B	and then he pretended to bite her and she was like ah she's was like
B	ah
C	and they said
B	jinx
C	oh now you're milking it and then
B	okay I think she
C	the
A	the bunny got captured?
C	no the lamb
A	the the lamb?
C	got captured
A	mm
C	of course nobody would guess a lamb was behind that
A	no
C	and she was the president and she was the president
A	oh she was the president?
C	yeah
A	so she was the one putting them in hospital
C	she turned she
B	well
C	no
B	no
C	the lion was er the lion before the president but he got put into prison
A	oh because he because all these things were going savage and stuff?
C	no because he
A	oh
C	was a because he was a lion and he could turn savage
B	no he no he didn't get put in prison they just feared
A	mm
B	and he got
A	so they stopped him being president?
C	no
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah and then the lamb became president and she
A	oh
C	and that was part of her plan
A	right
C	cos she was working for the lion or the lion was
A	and she just wanted rid of all the dangerous people?
C	she
A	but they weren't really dangerous?
C	they she wanted to get rid of them so that erm erm so that the fox couldn't be there and that they could find that if there was anybody standing in her way like the bunny
A	mm
C	of the friend she would she would kill them
A	get rid of them?
C	yeah
A	do you think she
C	and
A	really wanted them to go? or do you think she just wanted the power?
C	she just she wanted them to go and power so
A	mm
C	and then and before that the bunny made a speech and
B	erm
C	were
C	no
A	oh I see so they weren't going to be allowed to do it?
C	it was all predators remember?
B	yeah
C	predators not mammals
A	so they so they weren't going to be
B	so
A	allowed to be like police officers and stuff?
C	no and then in the end she said she talked about what she had fought and then the
A	mm
C	and then a really really fast car zoomed past them and then they said they put the sirens on
A	uhu
C	and then they came up you're under arrest and then the
A	whose Flash?
C	it's
B	the sloth
A	oh right okay
B	and then there was like
C	and then I'm gonna say it
A	I can't hear what you're saying
C	I'm gonna say it and it was
B	nay
C	nay because he wasn't
C	getting into trouble he didn't want to
B	he did no he said
A	nay?
B	yay
C	he said nay
A	I don't understand why
B	hey
A	Flash was in the car
C	because
A	oh for a speeding ticket?
C	no because he
A	oh
B	cos he was speeding he was going
A	so he was speeding?
B	yeah
A	and he would have
C	because he's a race cos he's a race car driver
A	really?
C	flash flash a hundred mile dash he's a sloth so he can't run but
A	but he can go really fast in a car?
B	no he was just speeding
C	no
A	goodness
C	cos it was really small and it had a and it had like a fire
A	but the fox
C	in
A	wasn't on erm speeding ticket duty?
C	no
B	no they were just
C	they were just they were trying to find erm
A	I'm confused
C	the cable was being nibbled by something
A	I'm really confused as to this bit of the film
B	erm it was at the end and they said and right and fox parking duty and they're like what? and he said only kidding there's this right here's your mission there's this car
A	ah
B	there is there is a person driving the car
C	no it's not no
B	and tearing up the town
A	oh it was
B	you need to try
A	and it was the sloth?
B	you need to catch him and lock him up
C	no
A	uhu
C	which are tearing up the town and they just thought well we can
A	mm
C	it's very funny
A	mm
C	and at the and at the end
B	and it was the gazelle
A	and
B	the gazelle singing
A	uhu
B	in the credits
C	and really really funny part is
C	erm
B	is dancing with the lady the lady sloth who worked next to him and they were like this
A	oh
B	and it and they probably started like this
A	dancing very slowly?
B	and then they
A	mm
B	do that like this
A	er how could the sloth drive a car?
B	he was like this
C	he had a race car
A	he's got very slow reactions though
C	no he
B	no he was like this
A	well can you explain what that is?
C	well cos a race car driver
A	yeah but how can he be if he's
B	it was just a joke
A	oh right
B	it was a joke at the end
A	fair enough
C	a joke at the end
A	fair enough
C	yeah
A	fair enough
C	you have no idea why that happened
A	okay so are you eating your cucumber? very good what's it got inside it that we learnt?
C	carotinin
A	carotinin
B	carotinin
A	tell
B	it is
A	or what it does
B	things
C	that make your face
A	no
C	more yellow
A	no I did not ask you did I? that's very naughty
B	it has carotinin is things inside fruit and vegetables
A	uhu
B	that make your face brighter and apparently more attractive
A	well they'd
A	make it a little bit yellow
C	oh
B	no not as in
C	I was gonna say that
B	not as in yellow disease
A	not as in bright yellow but as you say it makes we think that if we see someone with slightly yellowed skin and that it looks erm
B	brighter
A	healthy
C	mm
A	not brighter but healthy
A	which is actually correct isn't it? because if you're eating high levels of fruit and vegetables like the red yellow orange and green ones then you are healthy but we but when we saw that on the programme the people did look healthier didn't they?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	the yellower pictures
C	but mum
A	mm
C	carrots erm can be white or purple
A	they can
C	so eating a purple carrot wouldn't make you healthier would it?
A	that well it would it is healthy
B	it would
A	I am not sure how much
C	but it wouldn't make your face more yellower?
A	I don't know how
B	it might
A	the levels of the
C	cos they're er cos they're more riper
A	no
C	why?
A	well you used to get carrots in all different types of colours and then when William of Orange came over to rule this country he brought the orange carrot with him
C	so he painted an
A	no no they would there was a type of of carrot that was orange but there as you said there were also purple ones and all sorts of different colours but he brought that one over and
C	but the
A	made sure that that was the one that sort of took hold so that's why we have
C	but
A	orange carrots
C	the most erm the ones which are like here now are the red no the orange the purple and the white
A	have you ever seen a purple or white carrot?
C	yep
A	when?
A	in er Mr Bloom's
A	yeah but you don't when have you seen them in the supermarket? never
C	well
A	you can get
C	Mr Bloom grows em that means he has
A	you can get seeds in a in a garden centre that
B	oh I made up a song
A	but I've never seen ones in supermarkets
A	mm so what was our favourite thing or things from seeing the programme The Colours of Science?
B	I did
C	the ultraviolet
A	seeing the ultraviolet light? and as I said I used to have lipstick that was UV sensitive so if I wore it in the daytime you wouldn't be able to see it and when er I went to nightclubs which I still do obviously then
A	there's a particular type of lighting that they have which lights up your anything white like T-shirts it also made that you can get your face lit up in fact there's definitely some
B	mm
A	is it the
B	oh yeah the Bird of Paradise I
A	that was hilarious
B	no the Great Bird of
A	the Great Bird of Paradise the way it puffs and looks like a
B	a face
A	an oval face
A	it's mental
B	because the
A	I know but it looks so un-birdlike doesn't it? I couldn't believe
C	yeah
A	that was a real bird that was
B	yeah
A	hilarious yeah that was brilliant
B	you thought it was
A	I just I could see that it had birdlike feet behind it but I just couldn't believe that it was an actual bird because birds don't look like that do they? just bizarre
C	remember the one that was going look at my wings look at my wings
B	oh yeah
A	look at my wings look at my wings
B	oh yeah it was like
A	they were funny weren't they?
B	I liked the bird that
A	yeah
B	did a very very
A	a
B	doing the moonwalk thing
A	it was but what about though the the dress that was black and blue but looked white and gold?
C	yeah
B	that was just weird
A	it is weird isn't it? but what was so weird is that you could be in the same room with somebody and they would see it differently that's what's weird about it like but we all saw white and gold didn't we? but if someone else had been sitting with us they would have
B	well white and black are similar
A	white and black are not similar in any any sense are they?
B	well they're not
A	they're totally opposite
B	they're not colours
A	yes we know they're not technically colours so what are they?
B	they
A	one is an absence of colour really and the white is all of them mixed together isn't it?
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so the white is actually red and blue and green
A	stay sitting on your
B	and yellow
A	well my favourite favourite favourite favourite bit was when we saw a black and white picture
B	oh yeah I remember that
A	and then we stared at that the same picture which had a few colours on it and then they
B	oh the dots
A	switched back
B	oh the dot at the dot
A	looking at the dot in the centre and then we switched back to the black and white and then what happened?
C	it was colour
B	we saw it in colour
A	isn't that amazing?
B	yeah
C	just one minute
A	yeah it always reminds me we haven't seen this for years but the Wizard of Oz that is which is quite a long film
B	oh yeah I know that
A	that was like the first er or one of the first films done in colour but they start the film off in black and white
C	yeah
A	and the audience when they first saw it didn't know so they want to see a a black and white film that they thought can you imagine their reaction when suddenly they get to Oz and then the whole film changes into bright vivid colours?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	it must have been amazing
A	are you heading towards your Easter chocolate pile?
C	yes but I'm trying
