A	there is one where the barman but you only had certain change and then you gave the money and like a ten pound note and he gave you something else

H	I had my gas tank filled up yesterday
B	are you getting a new boiler Monday?
H	mm
B	so that's ready for the new boiler?
H	no he's just normal top up for gas
B	mm
H	but I should
E	did you know if you have it on top up you shouldn't have it on there because that's when they charge you more?
H	no it doesn't work like that
E	oh
F	no that's just with mum
E	the boilers man said you have a top up that's when they charge you more
F	yeah because it's supposed to be sixty-seven or something and then they charge you eighty-seven and then all together you can save two hundred pounds or something
H	no they come and fill the tank up
F	oh
E	okay
H	top up cards when you pay for your gas by going to the post office or going to
F	no mum's is is er these bits like that and then they come and top it up but they don't
E	when it's low
H	it's not that's not top up
E	oh
H	that's not top up
F	mm
H	no because she probably signed a contract at that point in time that because it was cheaper to do that contract then because she got so many perks
F	possibly
H	they catch you out because every time you change from one company to another company there has to be a another charge somewhere along the lines that gets put down

B	core science
H	core science is like everything
B	but then  but then  you do the biology
H	but then you do the biology the chemistry and the physics
B	the physics and chemistry
D	what are you going to do
E	what my options?
D	yeah
E	I don't know
D	pardon?
F	I've picked mine
D	you've picked yours
F	art and history
D	art and history did you
B	art and history
C	it's still
D	yeah I know but you've got to start thinking now
E	yeah
H	they would have changed it all again
D	oh they will won't they
E	I don't know
H	you've got no chance of that
D	do you think so?
H	yeah
D	and the Liberals will go with the Labour
H	I think they might do next time yeah
D	and they won't get their own way so much this time
E	when when will you vote?
F	A couple of weeks time I think it is for council elections
C	mm
E	oh
D	have we got them have we?
C	yeah
D	I don't think
H	well I thought no I thought we had them last year
C	oh
D	they were last year the
C	oh yeah
E	I thought it was two years ago because I walked down with you
B	well they've they've got vote Green signs everywhere in Norwich
H	no that was last year
A	well they're all up in Norwich
D	in Norwich yeah but not not in erm
B	not Breckland?
D	no
A	mm
C	mm
D	that's right
A	yeah there was Green and Labour posters everywhere in Norwich
D	and you get on a bungee thing
B	mm
F	yeah
D	and you got to hand your thing in
B	yeah Green have always been Norwich haven't they
A	mm
E	it's really funny isn't it
D	isn't it
H	they've had a control in power but they've one of the if I'm not mistaken one of the Green Party went over to Conservatives
F	my name's
B	oh
D	oh right
B	we're still registered in Cardiff
A	yeah
B	well it depends if you're here or not
A	mm
D	I just wish the Raving Loony Party was still about
A	no I just don't see the point in voting any more
C	oh I see
B	but you should vote though
A	well if there was someone worth voting for
H	then you can't moan about
C	no
A	well no I I vote but I spoil my ballot paper
D	that's true
D	yeah
A	not a choice between red or blue
D	no
A	they're basically the same
H	but you have the problem in an area like this where you will never get red
A	mm
D	and you have a problem in in an area like Yorkshire where you don't hardly ever get blue
H	oh I don't know
D	oh Newcastle and all of that way
H	oh Newcastle maybe but the likes of the farming community is very much blue
D	are they? What in in Yorkshire? Are they?
H	yeah
C	all farming and
H	all farmers are yeah
D	get counted
C	mm
D	and anybody that votes red or
C	yeah
D	yeah
F	I don't like this colour
H	not because because the way it's with constituencies you've got no chance
C	mm
H	you know you might be a red supporter in this area here
C	mm
H	but if you can get enough reds overall across the whole country then maybe that could be a fairer way
D	mm
H	but then then you will have you know you you've had certain areas where you've had the Independence Party stand against and does cause the effect that you do have a coalition government because everybody's gone with them
A	mm
C	mm
H	you know everybody
A	mm
H	but if you have more people then you're going to end up with not a real
A	mm
H	it's not proportional then
A	mm
H	you know if she got one person who is the Raving Loony Party
A	mm
H	that voice is not going to make much difference when everybody else is red is blue
D	no
A	er the problem I have is I can't distinguish between the parties any more
D	there's no
A	all they represent is erm the the wishes of big business and that's who runs the the governments not the
C	mm
H	but isn't that like the representing the big unions of the the Labour Party
A	mm
D	well they used to but they don't any more do they
H	well in lots of respects
A	the purpose of the union isn't essentially to make as much profit as possible whereas big business is
H	but
A	mm
H	they've if you take
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
H	you know and and if you you know it
B	it's difficult to fight for  what you  what you believe and what you think nowadays
H	yeah
B	mm
H	you know and then you have the propaganda like the the fuel strike
B	mm
H	well that's more than and that's that's that's
B	that's more than most teachers
A	yeah
B	and they drive lorries
H	and they drive lorries
B	that's crazy
H	they never
B	of the basic
H	because of the safety element of what you're actually carrying around
B	yeah
H	but when when you then put the army equation into it and what you get for being a private in the army
B	they get more than that for the army
A	I thought they started on about thirty
B	I thought they were on a really good wage
H	no
B	really?
A	they get looked after though don't they
H	but then have that's twenty thousand
B	yeah yeah so that's that's what they take home
H	that's
B	mm mm
H	I'm going to have to take time off work
B	then why do we do all of this training and all this work to try and improve ourselves?
B	yeah if that's what they want
H	you know
A	yeah
H	you know
D	boring
D	I like Lady Ga Ga
F	do you?
E	do you?
D	yeah
F	she's a bit weird though
D	yeah
E	I know
D	does it?
E	Don't you think it would smell?
D	yeah
F	no she's got it kept somewhere
E	no but won't it go off? Like you can't keep meat
D	but though just imagine you could actually fry her on stage
E	urgh
F	oh
D	oh yeah that would be good wouldn't it
E	my old room
F	yeah Pop's old room
D	was it? Did it have maggots in it?
E	I don't know I don't see it

D	yeah
F	yeah
D	yeah
F	like happy birthday
E	I think you should get like a massive card like
F	no I'm good thanks
D	that that that says you are thinking a lot of him
F	yeah
D	if you did get him that just get a card that says happy birthday
E	oh
D	yeah
D	is it?
F	yeah
E	yeah
D	no kisses
D	does it? Oh I didn't know
D	oh right
E	have you eve done an air hug? I do hug
F	cyber hug
E	do it like that
D	air hug
F	playing an air guitar?
D	yeah
F	that's a bit weird that isn't it
D	they have  they have  world championships on playing the air guitar
E	I'd be like
D	yeah
F	and er
E	it's really scary
D	and I put that on and at the same volume as the radio but it sounded so much louder so I had to turn it down
E	I bet the person in the shop was like
F	no
D	yeah
B	there's a new job
H	hmm
B	yeah and so they don't have to be a teacher and they just come in say your teacher said do we're doing this work here
E	we have them
F	yeah
H	yeah
B	so they're not actually teachers
H	cover supervisor
B	oh
H	no they've been out ages
E	we have them
B	do you? Are they any good? What do they do?
F	yeah but they're always at school but they have been qualified
E	yeah
B	they're qualified teachers
H	some of the
E	yeah
F	these these are
B	oh right
E	and they just like come in and teach
H	yeah they they they they they're cover supervisors
B	and they're
H	not not
B	not even a degree? Not an ordinary degree
H	not even a  not even a  degree
E	but my cover supervisor he she
D	is she a cover supervisor
F	erm
H	yeah
E	she is my DT teacher
F	yeah he she's my DT teacher too
H	yeah
B	right okay
H	which is a year on after your PGCE
B	right
H	because she's got a small child and she wanted to do something but  there's no  there's no preparation
B	yeah
H	and the amount of stick they get depending on where you are
B	yeah
H	A lot of LSAs become cover supervisors
B	mm
H	there there it's round about
B	when did they come out?
H	erm oh at least six years ago
B	oh
H	there's a thing in schools now called Rarely Cover where teachers are not supposed to cover
B	but they were covering too much because they didn't have any free periods to like plan the lessons properly so there shouldn't be any cover like that
H	so it's Rarely Cover is schools
B	mm
H	but academies break that rule
B	and they're allowed non teachers in there to what teach basically
H	yeah
B	what? Really? You must need something?
H	no
B	yeah a business person
H	like having no knowledge of education at all
B	er
H	and that's the way it's going it's the way it's going
B	mm
H	and the reason they're becoming academies is because the government don't want the control don't want the local authorities to have that control
B	mm
H	because of the way they dealt with them
B	okay
H	so the
B	mm mm
H	and then you
B	mm mm
H	there are
B	yeah
H	that's right
B	and they don't have the time to study up about the subject either
