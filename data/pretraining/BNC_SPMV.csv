A	so how are you making toothpaste?
B	I'm gonna make it up
A	mm
B	cos you don't want any glycerine in it apparently glycerine and fluoride are like
A	yeah
B	stop all the stop you developing
A	fluoride stops you getting cavities?
B	no fluoride makes
A	yeah
B	and glycerine sits on your teeth for erm weeks and weeks and weeks and
A	mm
B	your teeth can't remineralise themselves
A	what is that?
B	it's really salty
A	er it's real salty
B	yeah I need some more
A	probably
B	I don't I don't really know it's an experiment
A	can you neutralise the salt with a bit of sugar?
B	no cos sugar's bad for your teeth
A	oh yes
A	yeah
B	they're really really sweet so I might get a little bit of that juice
A	doesn't matter what colour it is
B	no
A	long as it doesn't stain your teeth
A	yeah and I was saying to saying to someone the other day that
B	yeah
A	and erm I was saying maybe that's why Indians have got such good white teeth
B	yeah
A	and they said well isn't that cos they've got dark skin
B	no
B	they didn't really?
A	yeah cos of the
B	the contrast?
A	the contrast
B	mm
A	no I I'm sure they do have good teeth generally
B	but they use some they use loads of different herbal products and you can't buy them I was wondering if you can buy them on the internet Taobao or something
A	yeah
B	even in
A	mm
B	you know that herbal toothpaste that I bought the menthol one? that's still got glycerine in it
A	yeah
B	right do you reckon cornstarch is gonna ruin this toothpaste or not?
A	guess that's just cheaper isn't it? I don't know
B	no I'm just making it up now
B	cos I don't have the ingredients
B	I don't have anything sweet so I was just looking in the cupboard for something sweet and I found a basil and peppermint
A	it's like George's Marvellous Medicine
A	yeah
B	that'd be good
A	hundred percent virgin coconut oil is that it?
B	yeah yeah
A	where did you get that from?
A	does it not go here?
B	use it all the time now
A	well you don't know what's in it do you
B	no
A	oh
B	cos of the heat
A	and how do you get it?
B	I read it
A	how do you get it out in winter then if it's rock solid?
B	well I couldn't so I didn't use it for ages
A	mm
B	and er
A	mm
B	look it's not it's too runny
A	erm okay what else can we put in it then?
A	what would er bulk it out a bit
B	but that's why I thought the cornstarch
A	yeah yeah
B	look it's only a tiny bit though
A	yeah mm
B	cornstarch you usually cook in sauces don't you?
A	yeah
B	maybe it needs to be heated
A	yeah
B	it's a bit of an abrasive for your teeth
A	well I think you should
B	I just want it to taste good though
B	no
A	does it?
B	it's too salty
B	oh it's far too salty
A	what special sugar?
B	mm?
A	what is it?
B	erm I can't remember the name of it now
A	yeah
B	she I want more of this and I want to know what it is
A	mm
B	they use they use peppermint essential oil as toothpaste
A	yeah well I thought maybe we could take a picture of her
B	yeah
A	with the right colours
B	and make
A	and then make a mandala
B	okay
A	and then
B	yeah that's a nice present
A	blow it up into er a poster or even a canvas or something
B	yeah
A	which she could put
B	yeah that's nice
A	cos she has given us a lot
B	but the thing is with
A	mm
B	but you could change the colours I suppose
A	yeah but you could change it
B	how about if I zap it in the microwave? do you think the baking soda would thicken or something? haven't got a little pan small enough to cook with
A	yeah but
B	I've gone and done in the only bowl that doesn't go in the microwave but
A	yeah
B	maybe
A	mm
B	keep it chewy for Christmas
B	hopefully she'll've used it by summer
A	well apparently
B	strictly vegan
A	yeah but she's just started eating loads of meat
B	mm
A	I dunno it's only a diet or something
B	that's a bit weird
A	yeah
B	shall I add some sesame oil I love sesame oil?
A	yeah could put some sweet chilli sauce in it
B	it's exciting this I feel
B	make concoctions
A	you know you are a witch so you should do
B	I want to make that room spray
A	has it thickened out?
B	oh god it's burned
A	er
B	oh
A	I dunno
B	I burnt it
B	it's like a cake
B	it's got loads of expensive stuff in that
B	well no actually
A	you could eat that
B	it'll be really salty won't it?
A	er
B	but I don't know
A	well I'd say that's a that's a fail
B	mm
B	it's like a biscuit that bit
A	super?
B	super powered microwave
A	that's cos
B	it's cos the baking soda has made it
B	oh no
A	could be onto something there
B	well I give up now
A	no I think I'll leave that actually
B	well it's got all good stuff in it
A	okay after you
B	well I'll wait for the microwave to stop cooking
B	it's like a biscuit
A	yeah a few seconds probably would've done it
B	oh crack
B	crispy
A	right
B	tastes really salty
B	oh my god oh my god
B	ah
A	well I don't think you'll be selling that to Glaxosmithkline
B	oh god
A	it's a learning curve
B	I'm gonna leave that there I can't even be bothered to tidy it up
A	mm
B	oh
B	maybe some orange peel or something
B	they've got they've put erm er
A	mm
B	or peppermint essential oil
A	I thought it'd be quite simple to make toothpaste
B	the glycerine
A	yeah
B	I'd just use
A	yeah
B	or I
A	yeah
B	and once a week turmeric
A	yeah
B	I don't think we should buy that toothpaste any more
A	no
B	they've got thinner at the ends
A	oh they're a bit clearer yeah
B	yeah they're clearer and they're and it's starting to show
A	mm
B	gap wise
A	that what that's because of the toothpaste you're using? or just cos you're getting older?
B	both I suppose
A	what's that humming noise?
B	I don't know
A	is it the air con machine?
B	that's not on
A	is it the TV?
B	I
A	sounds like it's coming from over there
B	oh that's cos you put the air con in in the erm
A	oh yeah
B	in in the study
A	oh right okay
B	that's why that's the
A	oh I should turn it off actually
B	you've had that blasting all day haven't you?
A	yeah I forgot it was on
B	it's been
A	no it's alright tonight
B	mm mm
A	it's a lot better
B	well I need to do some more research on this
A	mm
B	too natural
A	mm
B	so why is she on a meat diet cos she does?
A	I dunno
B	but she's vegetarian
B	can't suddenly go on a meat diet just cos someone tells you to
A	I dunno
A	sure she's got some reason for it
B	she's been so
A	don't think so
B	no
A	oh no they're
B	she went to
A	yeah

A	mm
B	couple of years
A	well I doubt it where they're living
B	doubt it because her teeth are lovely
A	mm
B	they were doing alright

B	yeah
A	I mean your family's they've all got bad teeth
B	thanks
A	no but it's true though
B	mm
A	I remember like a girl we worked with in

A	they were all perfectly in line I you know they
B	well
A	and they're just so such their family have got really good teeth

B	they still do
A	cos fluoride's deadly
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	what becomes normal
