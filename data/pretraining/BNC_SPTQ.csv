B	right
A	I mean people could call us normal but there again how wrong would they be?
B	well they're
A	how wrong could I could they be?
B	I mean the most interesting fact is that I think about these interviews that get recorded and sent to to these people at Cambridge Press is that people really don't tell them what they're thinking
A	well it's not really it's
B	no
