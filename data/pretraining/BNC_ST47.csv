A	so what did your tutor say?
B	I'm just going to
A	oh okay
A	can I pop this on the floor just
B	yeah of course
A	uh huh
B	um and
A	oh is that what your
B	errr
A	something about thanks for telling me with like twenty-four hours notice that
B	no
B	oh I don't know about that
B	um which has enabled me to um make my final changes to the document and
B	um
A	what kind of feedback did he give you was it
B	errm
A	what to add or what to take out or
B	he he suggests I actually change the title of the document
A	uh huh
B	he asks me to define whether there's a formal strategy document for a particular question that I'm trying to answer
A	mm
B	in terms of a review
A	okay
B	no no it's my title
A	oh right and what have you chosen?
B	um the title of the report is um How do design and cultural values within Nordic design led businesses influence digital and visual communications?
A	oh wow
B	um so I'm looking at a few different things there but I'm looking at communications how they are influenced by design and cultural values
A	mm mm
B	within a business which happens to be in the Nordic region which happens to be design led
A	mm mm
B	um and er using the case study of my time spent working at the placement in the in
A	oh okay so it's not just a report on what you learnt and stuff
A	an academic
B	yeah
A	practical context
B	yeah it's about um
B	it's I've I've proposed the piece of work myself so  it's not  it's not in answer to a explicit brief
A	and what did he suggest that you should change the title to?
B	he suggested um how does
A	it is cos yours
B	proposal
A	yours isn't just about the design strategy it's about the digital and visual communications
B	yes yes
A	hmm
B	so  I'm not  I'm not obliged to change it that's fine
A	mm mm
B	and I can ignore it if I choose to
A	yeah
B	when in the whole process of this project which is about six weeks now so far nobody has asked me to change the title and this tutor has seen this document this proposal all the way through the
A	did did he say that it that the title best that this title best suited the content? Because if you changed the title you would imagine that you'd have to rejuggle the content
B	his his first observation is the title needs to be reviewed to make it more concise without really changing the meaning or scope of the research
A	oh okay so it's not semantics
B	conciseness
A	it's just making the title shorter but the title that he's suggested is actually changing the focus isn't it?
B	to me it felt like that
A	yep
B	yep
A	yep
A	is there do you want to try and make the title a bit more concise?
B	no I'm fine with it
A	yep
B	I think that's the more critical
A	mm mm
B	nature
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	keeping within the word limit
B	erm
A	in particular
B	erm like I said before um any instances of repetition
B	yeah of course
A	can write down
B	here you go
A	ooh you've got post its
A	that's amazing
B	that's my selection
A	where did you get that from?
B	W H Smith's
A	beautiful
B	conciseness any repetition
A	uh huh
B	um and erm confusing argument
A	confusing argument
B	this is actually
A	oh okay
A	mm mm
B	because normally on my reflective diaries I try to leave one page for the day's observation and leave the next page free for returning to that observation
B	so I haven't really reflected on that day
B	erm yes
A	is that what your case studies based on notes
B	erm yeah
A	mm mm
B	to describe um my approach
B	what would that mean then?
A	ethnographic erm is generally widely erm understood as being when a researcher goes into a community or group of people and becomes a native to that group
A	mm mm
B	erm and
A	but you wanted to do
B	and  behaves as  behaves as one of them lives with them eats with them works with them
A	mm mm
B	it's quite a visual report but um er I don't know erm
A	mm mm
B	interview and
A	okay
B	because um I was one of them
A	yep
B	erm
A	cool
A	yep probably
B	erm
A	okay
B	erm there you go
A	cool
B	um what else?
B	erm just going to work that bit out
B	so what did you think about reading that work?
A	yeah I thought what what do you mean if it was easy to read or if it answers the question or
B	well
A	really interesting
B	yeah?
A	yeah I thought it was
B	yeah
A	you're the audience but you don't really realise that there is a strategy behind the communication
B	yeah I think sometimes it's um intrinsic
A	yeah
B	or um er sometimes recognised but
A	mm mm
B	braun Braun
A	mm mm yeah
B	and um so when you realise that there's a strategy behind something for me it's like the um comparison that I'm drawing is the same as when a designer talks about a
A	mm yeah it's just there
B	oh yeah
A	it's like you know they
B	have you read any of the blog that's on The Guardian website about Mad Men?
A	er no
B	you should read it because if you're a fan of it it every episode gets um um dissected
A	oh yeah
B	through the blog and erm you can read about the nuances and the references that you probably didn't realise why they were there
A	uh huh
B	um that signify things to do with um a political um occasion or a historical event
A	mm mm
B	like I thin kin the last episode he
A	oh yeah um
B	the really annoying one
A	Pete Campbell
B	Pete Campbell
A	ah yeah
B	and that's why you know it sort of adds
A	mm mm
B	the scriptwriting and the the production the production values and things like that
A	yeah that's really interesting
B	yeah
A	no I got into did you watch Lost?
B	no only the first series really
A	really
B	oh did you?
B	so people used to write on forums
A	yeah
B	or comment on blogs and things about it?
A	yeah yeah
B	no
A	it it relied
B	no which is a criticism of American um drama or any kind of TV that comes out of America that it's dumbed down
A	yes
B	titbits
A	to see if you could make the connections
A	and so it was it's like there was a lot of cross referencing because they were jumping backwards and forwards in time a lot as well
B	mm
A	you kind of clicked on relationships between
B	yeah
A	that didn't really matter to the er you know the momentum of the plot
B	mm
A	going to blah blah blah and so they are oh he does know her
B	no but
A	being moved along but like yeah the total geek squad picking up on little things that
B	but isn't it kind of like a common thread that draws all these um script writers together is their nerdiness sometimes isn't it
B	they're often accused of being nerds
A	probably
B	and kind of obsessional about things and like
A	uh huh
B	and um oh Chasing Amy
A	yeah
B	remember that film?
A	yeah yeah
B	kind of cult status films
A	with Ben Affleck and
B	hmm
A	yeah that kind of crowd
B	yeah Matt Damon
A	pizza
A	so in your opinion would you say Mad Men is the most enjoyable American series of all time or what would be?
B	no
A	which what would you say is then?
B	better? Sex and the City
A	do you think so?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	longer running
A	but in terms of your enjoyment of it
B	sex and the City
A	that's really funny cos I find Sex and the City quite entertaining but I don't see it as being yes that's like Oscar Oscar quality
B	hmm well they did win lots of awards didn't they
A	and Friends of course
B	hmm
A	although it's so dated now
B	I
A	mm mm
B	oh my god
A	in winter after work just getting through about six episodes a night
B	is Spanish TV that bad?
A	mm mm
B	horrendous
A	did you watch um you being an expert in Nordic things did you watch The Killing
B	mm yeah I loved that
A	yeah I rate it too
B	I think it was great
A	hmm
A	I thought it was but the second series I didn't think was um I think sometimes they were just injecting twists and turns into the plot that didn't really need to be there
B	hmm
A	it felt maybe a bit contrived at times
B	oh okay well I liked both
A	but
B	I thought the acting was brilliant
A	extremely entertaining
B	I was like waiting every Saturday
A	ah yeah
B	no I think that's a thriller
A	has it started already or
B	it started last night
A	what channel?
B	four
A	oh okay
B	hmm
A	I think we do comedy and documentaries really well but
B	yeah but
A	series
B	like Silent Witness has like
A	hmm
B	been going for God knows how many years
A	true
B	it gets sold all over the World
A	yeah
B	mm
A	or is that does that have plot lines that run over?
B	sort of
A	hmm that's right
B	why?
B	why?
A	I don't know  I don't know
B	are you impatient?
B	I love Homeland though
A	yeah
B	incredible
A	mm mm
B	mm yeah
A	he's
B	Morgan
A	yeah he's from Birmingham
B	oh right
A	and he went to
B	no way
A	yeah
B	mm mm
B	I think it was a good idea to get the pepperoni on this
A	mm it's gorgeous isn't it
B	yeah
A	really?
A	so what did you get up to last night
B	we went to um we went to
A	I don't know those places really
B	really?
A	is that the place we tried to get into on your birthday? Oh on
B	no
A	hm
B	I don't know
A	it's not by the mailbox
B	it's near there but it's on the
A	mm
B	do you know?
A	erm I don't know where the
B	the big road the like dual carriageway by the mailbox
A	mm mm underneath
B	on the other side
A	mm mm
B	A bit further down
A	mm I think we tried to go there
B	oh right
A	but it was packed full of er eighteen year olds
B	yeah
A	so we didn't go
A	mm
B	last night?
A	oh really?
B	mm mm
A	did um
B	yeah
A	ah that's good
B	alright I think
A	has her website gone live?
B	no not yet
A	yeah
B	I think two
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	yeah last time I saw her I think she said she was quite stressed because on the Thursdays and Fridays that she gets to work on the business you know she gets all these phone calls and text messages and at the same time she's
B	yeah
A	and she was trying to multitask everything that was going on in her life
B	mm
A	she's she was like getting chest pains and stuff from it and getting so stressed
B	hmm
A	what's this sauce like is it oh
B	it's quite nice
A	it's alright
B	you don't eat crusts?
A	mm if I'm super hungry yeah
A	it depends on what the crusts or  what the  what the base of the pizza's like as well
B	mm this is a good combination of flavours though isn't it
A	mm mm
A	what time's it got to be handed in?
B	midday
A	well you can work on it tomorrow morning then as well
B	I don't really like working in it in the mornings
A	hm
B	cos no
A	hm
B	but it depends how late it goes tonight I suppose
A	but then do you work better at night?
B	I don't
A	really? When do you work better?
B	in the mornings
A	well it would stand to reason maybe you did a couple more hours tonight have a good night's sleep and got up early and did it then
B	yeah you're probably right
A	how come?
B	Cos it's got to be printed
A	can you not just print it out here?
B	I could but I like to get them bound
A	mm
B	and these here these are all like my previous ones
A	oh good
B	I've been like keeping a copy of each
A	mm
B	everything I've handed in I've kept I've had a copy done so I'm building up like a bit of an archive of work really
A	mm mm
B	because
A	knowledge
B	yes but
B	it's good to have these points of reference to go back to isn't it
A	mm yeah
B	erm and learn from
A	yep definitely
B	or reflect upon maybe
B	from your course tutor you can look over what they've said in relation to the piece of work with the actual piece of work in front of you and make more sense of it
A	true
B	in town
A	is it expensive to
B	it can be
A	really?
B	yeah
B	yeah but I I just I feel like it's worth it because this course it it means a lot to me
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	things like that or
B	I think so
A	mm
B	a belief that you have in in a business context
A	hm
B	so this is all evidence gathering in a way
A	Will you do that to the client or  in your own  in your own interests
B	in my own way of course it will be different because it won't be in an academic context and often it's about smaller pieces of information that you can get across clearly and concisely and easily
A	mm mm
B	that anybody can understand
A	yeah
B	into whichever context it needs to be in
A	mm
B	so I think that's good
A	it gives you more perception more
A	better grammar
B	mm more clever
A	yeah I found that after doing um the diploma
B	mm
A	in teaching that er I actually felt it kind of messed with my head after I just competed it and that when I was teaching I was just aware of all the different possible factors or effects and consequences involved in every single step of every single stage of a lesson
B	because you had
A	because I'd studied it so in depth
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	it's just choosing what information to use isn't it
A	mm
B	and what to discard
A	that you cut it down
B	it'd be nice to get to three thousand five hundred
A	and what is it at now?
B	hmm
A	it was four thousand four hundred wasn't it?
B	four thousand five hundred
A	yeah
B	hm
A	do you have any idea of any bits that you're just gonna cut out completely?
B	hmm maybe once I've gone through what you've suggested in terms of like word order and conciseness potentially like this section on the um responsibility activities
A	mm mm
B	because that is that's a hundred and fifty almost
A	I reckon maybe cut out two hundred words just by going through and er rewording things
B	hm
B	well there's one six nine in that table as well so that's one seventy
A	okay cool
B	so that's now we're down to six fifty-five fifty-five three five five hundred and thirty
A	mm mm
B	sorry how much was it over the last one? I can check
A	I heard your welsh accent come out then
A	really?
B	mm
A	and maybe in times of ridiculous stress
A	and pressure
B	yes maybe
B	three seven ninety and I think
A	and yet it wasn't penalised?
B	I don't believe so
A	so why
B	it scored eighty-nine percent
A	so why do you want to cut this one down?
B	I don't know
A	right
B	hmm
A	ah okay
B	no
A	hm
B	have they moved into the nineties? On the radio
B	they were great
A	I loved them
B	do you? I don't think I've listened to them that much
A	thirty-six
B	thirty-one
A	mm yeah
B	yeah
A	sixteen
B	yeah but not the House Martins
A	the House Martins was earlier but my brother liked them so
B	oh okay you've got an older brother
A	yep
B	how old is your brother?
A	three years older than me
B	oh okay
A	yeah he turned forty recently
B	where does he live?
A	Australia
B	oh really
A	yeah
B	where? Which city?
A	Perth
B	ah nice
A	yeah
A	with a barbeque Near the beach
B	how long has he lived there?
A	ooh gosh I think he moved out there about five years ago
B	and why did he go there?
A	oh just cos he he hated England
A	yeah I I don't think he ever got himself into a situation in England that merited staying for
B	oh right
A	well he's in kind of marketing erm advertising
B	oh right
B	oh okay
A	and so he came over to Madrid
B	like branding and stuff like that
A	mm yep
B	oh no
A	so he phoned me up
B	wow
A	and all that stuff
B	sounds interesting
A	it was interesting yeah but my brother was so unprofessional he kept whispering stuff into my ear I was trying to focus on
A	yeah I know
B	I love watching or um no I'm watching twenty twelve at the moment have you been watching that? It's like a
A	no
B	it's a spoof comedy um story about twenty twelve Olympics
A	uh huh
B	and
A	oh I think I've heard of it yeah
B	yeah and
A	can I have another piece
B	of course
A	mm mm
B	and legacy and deliverance
B	title and um they they often show them like
B	I've been I went to a um I went to a networking event in Helsinki and um  it was  it was kind of an international business
A	mm mm
B	or like yes I think we'll just leave that on the table
B	people exist like that
A	mm mm
B	hmm
A	Good parody on reality
B	mm
A	yep
B	and they try and like interrupt you and you just
B	or they don't listen to what you're saying
A	or use management speak
B	mm
B	that's funny
A	so what is it is it is the build up to the Olympics
B	mm
A	or while they're actually happening?
B	no it's the build up
A	mm mm
B	and he's always being called upstairs to go and see Sebastian Coe
B	or Boris Johnson hasn't been told about something or so
A	well it must be happening somewhere no?
B	mm
A	there's probably some kind of coordination office
B	mm
A	High up
B	mm
A	in London?
B	I hadn't really thought about it
A	well there are posters up umm everywhere around Birmingham saying be careful the traffic might be
B	what?
A	certain motorways might be
B	in Birmingham?
A	yeah yeah
B	oh I know they're playing football in Coventry
A	oh are they?
B	and in Birmingham
A	ah
B	the Aston Villa ground isn't it?
A	I don't know
A	these pizzas are so filling
B	they're terrible aren't they
A	mm mm
B	terribly good
A	mm mm
A	very tasty
A	I think
B	oh really
A	I've got a feeling that a friend of mine is playing as well she's got like some gig in some Olympic village or something
B	um two weeks three weeks
A	I really have no idea
B	might be a month
A	well they've said like even internet connections might be
B	internet
A	interrupted
B	bandwidth
A	yeah
B	aS long as I can watch Eastenders on iPlayer I don't care
B	if something goes wrong with that then I will get upset
A	mm
B	you think?
A	oh god it's already started
B	oh yeah but
A	everything's about Britain and Union Jacks everywhere its
B	do you want to split this?
A	no thanks I can't manage anymore
B	neither can I really
A	save it for you er late night
B	midnight snack
B	put it in that little box
A	cold pizza is just as nice as hot pizza
B	oh god yeah I mean I just kind of painful face
B	at the thought of being up at midnight working on this thing
A	aw
B	nine o'clock pizza
A	er half six
B	oh is that all
A	no
B	I'm gonna save it
A	how much was it in total?
B	Don't worry about it
A	are you sure?
B	yeah
A	that's very kind of you
A	okay so the parts I
B	just
A	yeah
B	thanks
A	sorry
B	that's alright
A	oh
A	once you start eating junk food it's very difficult to stop
B	yeah
A	um
A	no I thought maybe this information was already kind of included cos it's saying
B	yes I know
A	it's working across different expertise areas but is that part of the small interdisciplinary team
B	possibly
A	does it need to be
B	I'll check
A	uh-huh
B	relevance
A	yeah to the previous page cos that's where it was giving an example of
B	okay
A	but I just thought it seemed a bit weird there because you didn't really talk about the structure here whereas you did here
B	okay
A	do you see what I mean
B	yep
A	um
B	there's data in here that's missing that you haven't seen that explains it
A	oh okay
B	so I think that wil be okay
A	okay cool
B	but it's about
A	and the branding that you've discussed before
B	okay I can get rid of
A	it depends if
B	I think that might be there
A	oh yeah
B	you suggested putting that down
A	just putting those two sentences down with that one because
B	oh okay fine
A	it it wasn't logical to the reader how to
B	reads better
A	where it followed on from
B	yeah it should be there then shouldn't it
A	Cos it
A	can be quite clunky and it adds extra words to your word count as well
B	yeah yeah
A	so or you could say um it is argued that at the beginning of the sentence and then in in
B	sure
A	so I've um scribbled that out on quite a few occasions
B	that's to do with my methodology
A	yeah
B	it's a challenge
A	maybe cos you've done quite a lot of criticising your design method and suggesting
B	yeah
A	findings
B	yeah
A	the most important bit of the sentence it would be clearer
B	yep fine
A	by splitting them up
B	okay fine
A	or there
B	I might need to um tidy this bit up
A	oh and check that thing that if you um
B	okay
A	the page number
B	okay
A	um
B	okay
A	and just the translated from Finnish as well just stuff like that
B	yeah
A	Don't know if it's necessary
B	this bit I need to move cos that's kind of like a primary piece of evidence
A	ah so you put it after the
B	yeah and also I'm already
A	uh-huh
B	right fine
A	okey dokey
B	yep
A	um yeah how come you've got a title here at the
B	I dunno
B	it's fine
A	and then
B	I was thinkng this bit might be a bit big and maybe I can just reduce it
A	uh-huh
B	either by putting more of this into the
A	un-huh
B	or um
A	or just cutting it out if it's not
B	yeah
A	is it part of the ongoing text or is it a caption?
B	that's a caption
A	that bit's ongoing text?
B	yep
A	okay
B	four hundred
A	more or less falls into the word limit
B	yep
A	so I don't think there's a problem with that cutting that bit down
B	yep
A	manner
B	yep
A	and just make it really explicit
B	mm
A	whereas I think it the booklet it said summarise your main your key points first
B	yeah okay
A	um
A	I didn't really understand that
B	that's because that's a piece I've
A	oh okay
B	that's it okay
A	oh and that was that last paragraph that we thought maybe
B	yeah that's fine
A	wasn't necessary
B	okay
A	but kudos to you
B	really I don't know yet
B	yes
B	I'm just going to start editing it now
A	cool
B	yeah
A	right I'll go downstairs for a bit
B	alright
A	I'll come back up
B	well let me get  let me get through it based on what you've done here and then I'll see what I'm down to and then see how we go from there
A	okay
B	okay
A	nice one
