A	alright beer
B	yes
A	what do you think of the pink swirly patterned upholstery fabric?
B	again it could be nineties can I see the actual picture to see what the pattern is?
A	yes
B	did see
A	yes and I agree
B	different fabrics or all-in-one?
A	erm
B	no I'm not saying that
A	but you think the pink is too nineties do you?
B	I don't know it depends what the actual pattern is
A	is this switched on?
B	it is now
A	well you can see the pattern from that oh
B	whoops it isn't now it's normally you that does that isn't it darling?
A	it's very annoying will you get the right one?
B	you smell nice
A	well I've got my period
B	well I came out of that quite
A	lightly?
B	lightly like having my mum here probably helps settle you don't a bit
A	mm my sister set me off though
B	no
A	well if it's a no then we've only got a few days to email all the councillors about it
B	and do what?
A	tell them we don't think they should knock it down
B	no I mean what do they want to do there? to it?
A	they want to maintain the façade
B	oh
A	but build at the back of it knock everything else down and it's gonna be a sort of modern glass building
B	oh
A	er improved libraries and leisure facilities so they say
B	sounds that's not too bad
A	but it's a nice building
B	look darling the Independent's gone under
A	that was sudden when did that happen? now?
B	do you remember when it launched?
A	yeah it was nineties wasn't it? or was it eighties?
B	they're not gonna print it any more
A	oh
B	meow
A	I think that must be the same for all papers isn't it?
B	mm
B	you said you had yes are you going to make supper darling?
A	no oh did you bring chips?
B	yes
A	well I'll put the chips on
B	what was that darling?
B	you don't approve of chips?
A	was that a little grunt? that was a grunt wasn't it
B	chips are boring
A	right this
B	yeah I think that's alright then
A	well it's a shame to knock down
B	what's gonna be in it?
A	one of the decent buildings though isn't it?
B	it's not the decent building
A	it is a decent building
B	but that front bit they're keeping you said
A	yeah only the façade
B	it's a weird building inside cos the library is only a little the front two rooms and you can't even go through to the upstairs can you?
A	but apparently there's a gym but I dunno where that is exactly
B	yeah that's behind it that's where I erm play badminton
A	mm is it a separate building or the same building?
B	it's a separate building
A	but it seems like a huge building so what are the other rooms?
B	maybe they're joining it all up
A	well
B	I don't know what's behind other than the other than the main building
A	right so not
B	corrugated steel
A	the old
B	yeah like I said it's just like
A	yeah cos they're gonna that's what they're I mean there might be good things that would come out of it that's what they're hoping to improve
B	well yes
A	the thing is you need to read erm don't let that unplug again
B	local matters for local people
A	yeah you need to read all the comments so you've got some knowledge on it
A	but they're voting on it on Wednesday so our chance is
B	wow it would be cool though to have a contemporary gym and leisure centre there
A	I've not read all those but there's not enough information about what's actually going to be in it it just depends if they've actually what's in the thing? I mean yeah but if you think in thirty years' time are we gonna still like the building? or are we gonna wish to have the old building back? cos they don't really age very well do they? the older buildings Victorian and Georgian buildings age very well well they all look lovely don't they? I'm not just being nostalgic
B	oh look I know that building
A	is that a façade joke that he's talking about?
B	no that's they really did that
A	what? the
B	just preserved that
A	that's the
B	and then built that thing behind it
A	but there's no windows in it
B	no they just had to legally preserve that bit so that's what they did
A	why didn't they put windows in it though?
B	it's just by erm it's in
A	the building that's weird
B	it's horrible it
A	oh my god
A	they're not just going over the top of it like that
B	oh god that's
A	well the thing is now's our chance to stop more ugliness from occurring
B	yeah
A	knocked it down
B	look at this dear
A	so but this is happening now this is what
B	this is called when façades go wrong
A	yeah
B	yeah that just drowns
A	er hugely drowning it out?
B	two feet away
A	oh god
B	it's weird that's one of the most stupidest buildings it won the Carbuncle Cup
A	yeah well
B	what was the other one that I don't know about?
A	I don't know but they have got two
B	I wonder what the first one would have been oh
B	there's a link on there on Facebook
A	yeah
B	the
B	called it's where I play badminton
A	that's right
B	shame because I was sort of planning to work there one day wasn't I?
A	well it would still be there
B	good point maybe
A	and maybe bigger
B	with more jobs
A	no you can't get into it you've tried
B	yes I've tried
A	I was going to let you give up on that one
B	we got let home half an hour early today because it wasn't very busy
A	oh is that bad?
B	well it's good leadership skills
A	oh who who being leader?
B	the boss oh look at that
A	we've seen that loads of times
B	oh sorry
A	oh
B	oh no
A	I want to read all those comments
B	just horrible
A	and there you go and all the email addresses are on there so what do you think
B	is it
B	erm
A	I don't think that is him actually
B	no it's
A	well erm
A	well if you want to object we can do so it's not a formal objection it's just sort of writing to the councillors hello darling has he had supper now?
B	yeah
A	there is that better? you got something in your tummy now is that better? yes
A	oh people just think that the medical profession should be like gods mm
B	thing is that's the old this building here was the old gym
A	right
B	it wasn't even part of this block
A	yeah
B	that's the police station
A	yep
B	it's got the badminton courts
A	has it?
B	the squash court's just shit
A	no that's in the old one
B	who cares about squash?
A	but what's in the new one?
B	have you seen all those
A	where's that?
B	all those sort of historic buildings around Sainsbury's
A	you look like a little lion now ah yeah
B	mm he likes that
A	yes
B	oh gosh that's just right
A	oh that is just perfect isn't it
B	want to show me the fabric then?
A	it's upstairs
B	no mean the pattern dear
A	er oh
B	mm
A	a little massage then yes oh
A	the sound of purr
B	Yorkshire Fabrics
A	well thank you now you say
B	I wouldn't commit to either
A	well I know but this is why I'm asking if you had to
B	yes but I said neither effectively didn't I?
A	yes but that's not an answer to the question
B	oh
A	supposing there aren't any other options and we have to choose one
B	I think just stick with the brown velvet
A	oh no that's wriggling out of the question
A	I can't find it dunno what it was called
B	look on sofa chairs
A	yeah but I don't know if this is how we found it before and it's not working
B	no the click doesn't work very well
A	oh
B	well can I
A	half a year
B	we love taking forever to choose
A	no I don't like taking forever
B	oh
A	can we just choose one and be done with it? shall I send these to your mum and ask her to choose between them? cos I've noticed you haven't ordered any samples out of the ones that
A	you've been
B	well have you seen how much they are?
A	you can order a sample I mean why are you
B	did you see how much they were?
A	yes I did
A	then why have you been looking at them then?
B	cos we're going to do it get it right
A	we can't just cos it's not gonna be well enough upholstered to bother with that
B	yeah that is very true
A	so and also that's what your sister said did you notice what your sister said?
B	yeah
A	and that's what I am saying so don't deliberate on it
B	bit chilly down here all of a sudden
A	yeah
B	did you like the one with the stalk?
A	think I
B	oh
A	just start being realistic about it
B	realistic it's our house though
A	cos it is cold outside
B	well the heater's on
A	so are these two both
B	that is
A	are these these rejects then?
B	no I didn't say that what about that colour look?
A	well you have you've said you don't want either
B	well I want to just look my mum has sent me some too
A	has she been to the fabric shop?
B	yes I think that's what she meant actually she's posted me some
A	oh right
B	or does she mean she's sent me a link?
A	well let me read her email then
B	no I'm getting back to where I was or to return to where I left off
A	yeah
B	that's about just exactly what we did in London anyway
A	no it was more than eighteen years later in our case
B	in London that was yeah
A	mm
B	probably the wind in the chimney breast
A	no
B	no that's it look
A	which one? that's like that one though
B	that is that surely
A	no it's not
B	mm you're right dear very similar
A	right well
B	waiting it to load I'm not gonna go
A	yeah you went back to the beginning
B	that's what it does every time you
A	but I hope your mum sent some swatches rather than
B	quite sweet
A	yeah
B	what dear?
A	probably the wrong colour
B	pink?
A	it has actually isn't it it's nice it's very nice actually
B	yeah I like that
A	well order a sample then please you do it on here
B	I'll just save that one and then you can go back and do all this
A	how have you saved it? in what form have you saved it?
B	trying to find like a Word document or something what's it called in orange?
A	just put the place the order for the sample that's the easiest thing to do by the time you've got round to all that
B	yeah but I want just want to get on with doing what I'm doing
A	well you can quicker if you do that
B	look that one was thirty-three pounds
A	yeah you're still on looking
