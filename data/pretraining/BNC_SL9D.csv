B	yeah
A	um
B	mm
A	and I was surprised actually
B	yes
B	when you say she landed on his lap that implies she was sitting in it
A	mm
B	mm
B	no
A	mm
B	apparently he's got a deadline at work like middle of next week
A	yeah
B	I was like
A	yeah like
B	pulling these hours
A	yeah insane hours
B	why?
A	like particularly you wouldn't have thought he was particularly senior or particularly key to need to be pulling eleven hour days
B	mm
A	do you know what I mean? You wonder if it's because he hasn't actually done anything at work for a week
B	yeah
A	which is
B	but
A	kinda scary
B	but surely he's like he is still a consultant essentially
A	mm
B	so he'll be booking time on a time sheet
B	he's like
A	yeah
B	well I have really unproductive days but that's mainly cos of research
A	yeah but you
B	unproductive
A	well exactly
B	mm

B	it was
A	hm?
B	oo
A	nice
B	that's why you
A	yes
B	if I'd been a bit quicker I could've I'm almost considering ramming
B	that's just called murder
B	oh yeah
A	more critically
B	you see the thing is
A	you er ring your dad up
A	that'd be quite funny
B	you see the thing is if I had hit him that would've been so easy
A	it would be your fault
B	to explain to the
B	wouldn't have been
A	mm
B	he was wearing black
A	yeah
B	no lights
A	he didn't have lights on did he

B	I just didn't you know couldn't see him
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah I mean he
B	um
B	we might've been in a slightly different ball game
B	um
A	yeah
B	but it would've been difficult to prove
A	oh some people are just mental
B	the optimum would've been to hit his rear wheel
A	hm
B	sort of take him off the bike
B	well if I'd been thinking a bit quicker and he was a bit slower I could've gone after him down
B	boxed him in
B	explained to him in gentle civilized terms what you do not do
A	hm
