B	yeah yeah I know yes
A	the who's got two daughters
B	uhu
B	yes
A	he wants to invite her and
B	why?
A	because it's Mother's day and
B	oh dear
A	she says that they weren't going to so he said well we're not going without her
B	oh
B	okay
A	so now she's not talking to him
B	excellent
A	and now erm she's not going anywhere but of course we will have to but that was what she wanted to tell your dad this morning
B	okay
A	so she has to we have to be involved in every little minutia of their life
B	why doesn't she why doesn't she why doesn't she just go with
A	I dunno
B	oh dear
A	I don't wanna go I hate it there it's horrible you feel quite ill as you're eating
B	yeah it's vile
A	it's always cold it's uncomfortable
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it smells of school dinner well you know don't you?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I might not go
B	no I don't think so
A	what you doing on the computer?
B	I don't
A	oh right okay is it
B	yeah
A	no I don't need you to
B	good
A	no
B	no? he won't wake
A	yes
B	why because they did one last week?
A	yeah but I hadn't really caught up what the week before was really difficult now we've got a new teacher
B	oh yeah well it'll probably be the same for everyone
A	yeah maybe
B	I don't imagine an extra week will have given them much of an advantage
A	no no I don't think it no it won't well
B	yeah oh
A	it's just erm getting difficult
B	mm
A	I can't remember all the signs
B	well it's like
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but
B	what was the erm
A	oh I don't know they've got a pipe delivery up there so it'll be weeks of checking pipes off wagons
B	oh
A	you just have to sign off get delivery notes signed off so they pay
B	oh
A	but according to
B	uhu
B	yeah
A	your dad left a message
A	she says they're already refusing to pay and they've only just the pipes have only just landed
B	oh really?
A	so it's same old same old
B	mm
A	they came without some of the end caps were missing so they insist on the pipes being flushed out cos they they'll have sea water and all sorts in them which they won't
B	right lovely
A	end caps always fall off
B	oh okay
A	so they want them all out on the side of the docks and all cleaned and all I
B	no
B	is he he's still up there then?
A	yeah yeah he was he's there this week again now
B	oh okay
A	and he has to come back to hand some paperwork to the bank because he can't trust it by registered post
B	mm
A	it goes into the wrong hands they lose it for a week and week's too long
B	oh
A	it's a piece of paper for the letter of credit and you have to have about ten documents lined up and then once they're all lined up they pay out but if one goes missing for a week you can't afford the delay
B	no cos they won't pay until they call come
A	mm so we ended up handing stuff to the bank I person
B	ah
A	with one of the bits of paper
B	and he's drove up there?
A	flies sometimes but this is
B	fucking day isn't it?
A	no Glasgow's not too far
B	oh is it not?
B	oh
B	yeah yeah
A	it's about four four and a half hours I think four and a half hours maybe
B	oh okay
A	to Glasgow it's not as far up as Aberdeen and places like that so
B	still wouldn't fancy it
A	well no
B	mm right let's see if this Powerpoint presentation works
A	have you got to do a test for your new girl as well? or is that what you're gonna do?
B	mm no I don't think I'm gonna bother
A	no good asking me
B	yeah I need to go and get some er
B	but it turns out she can't do today she's got to do erm tomorrow
A	why did they make a commitment for Wednesday and then change it so quickly?
B	she said something about her having to go to religious studies at the mosque
A	well where's the mosque?
B	I have no idea
A	must be
B	guessing so anyway she said that she didn't want her to do it all the time erm and so I said oh okay er so she was happy for me and I said are you sure it's alright for me to do er erm
A	what do you mean she doesn't want to do it all the time? doesn't want tutoring every week?
B	no she doesn't want to go to she doesn't
A	oh
B	doesn't want her doing her religious studies all the time she'd rather her do a little bit of school study and then religious studies you know the other three days
A	oh right
B	cos I think she goes erm oh I think she goes every
B	shush
B	Monday to Thursday erm so
A	every day?
B	Monday to Thursday yeah
A	does the whole family go then or is it just her?
B	I don't I don't know I think her mum goes with her
A	your dad was looking at tickets for the Davis Cup cos it's in Birmingham
B	oh is it?
A	or Edgbaston way next next weekend
B	oh okay
A	but they were sixty-five quid a ticket so we've decided we're not gonna go
A	it's on the Friday Saturday and Sunday the fourth fifth and sixth of March
B	oh is it? okay
A	it's a pity cos if I could
B	yes
A	cos Murray'll be playing it will be good
B	oh dear yeah yeah
A	but
B	right let's see I wonder if
A	he thought the tickets were extortionate I thought they were about right
B	yeah
B	oh dear
A	he suggested it then he looked it up and he
A	I know Nottingham was a lot cheaper but that's just because it's much lower rank players
B	oh
A	apart from
B	mm
A	they tend to be a bit cheaper as well than watching the men
B	where did you say it was again? in Birmingham but where
A	I think it's er Birmingham Edgbaston or somewhere like that
B	oh okay
A	yeah I don't I don't know I can't remember
B	ah
A	one of the indoor arenas or something isn't it?
B	yes yes I think it yeah probably is
B	so this works but I don't know how to save it onto the erm onto the computer
A	why? just cos it's Apple? but it's also different?
B	mm
A	oh
B	yeah I don't know how to
A	can you just leave it open?
B	er I don't know whether because it's open via a
A	oh I see
B	erm oh anyway oh desktop
A	this is for the two girls is it?
B	yes no it's erm
A	oh for the new girl?
B	yes
A	what are you teaching tonight? maths or English?
B	er a bit of both erm we're doing the Argos catalogue
A	oh yeah
B	thing and they've got to design their own erm bedroom we've got a er
A	mm
B	they've gotta design their own bedroom
B	and to do that they've got to look in the Argos catalogue price it up they've got a budget of a thousand pounds so they've gotta
B	they've got to find the things in the Argos catalogue to start with so they've gotta use the index
A	yeah
B	so that's a bit of English
A	oh I see and the budget for maths
B	mm so it should take them a long time I need to go and get some er child-friendly scissors
A	are they cutting thing out the Argus catalogue then?
B	have a look there yeah gonna stick them into their er gonna stick them on a piece of paper
A	good idea
B	well I was losing them a little bit last week cos of what we were doing so
A	right you're making it easier?
B	doing something fun
A	mm
B	no it's mm
A	different
B	not really easier it's just yeah applying it a little bit more rather than just erm practicing sums which they needed to do though it was like couldn't be avoided now I dunno if we want yeah marvellous right I'm gonna close them now and see if they open up on the computer fingers crossed because otherwise yay
A	do you think
B	erm I don't know cos they obviously know the situation with that we haven't long had
A	looking after the baby
B	he's looking after him for a bit
A	mm
B	erm yeah I don't know I don't think they've asked though not that he's said anything
A	does he know how many people they're interviewing?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	from well in the
A	yeah
B	er in the industry already but er so he seems to think well they're just gonna get it aren't they? thinking well
A	well not necessarily
B	yeah I said they wouldn't have even considered you if they didn't think
A	oh he must have a good chance
B	well exactly I said they wouldn't have even bothered interviewing you
A	no
B	if they were just gonna recruit people from
A	well they they do
B	there already
A	they do actually do that because they have to be seen to take a
B	oh
A	broad spectrum
B	of course yeah
A	it's like when
B	yeah
A	cos you've gotta go through the procedure
B	mm
A	so he is you know
B	okay
A	yeah that that isn't a
B	oh
A	a foregone but even if they're doing that and then they come across somebody that's actually oh really good
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know and it makes them think twice
B	mm
A	so
B	hopefully they'll er
A	and he said they were quite keen on the fact he had experience outside of er
B	mm
A	the remit of a lot of the people they were interviewing internally
B	uhu cos they were only on graduate schemes and obviously he's done three years whereas they'll have only done
A	yeah
B	well probably maybe a year some of them to
A	yeah
B	get onto the next position that they're in three and four but
A	so he wasn't home last night then choosing a car?
B	not just yet
B	he will be
B	he's just never really serious
B	but er yes of course he
A	that woman who's replaced who
B	nice
A	but according to
B	yes she was telling me
A	oh she did? did she speak to you? erm
B	yeah
A	from the high street
B	from the high street store
A	and the police are coming in to talk to them today so hopefully
B	mm yeah she said they're having a meeting with him er with the police so
A	is
B	no I don't think so I think she's just
A	why wouldn't
B	I dunno
A	why wouldn't they
B	yeah I thought that
A	go and see them? that's crazy
A	anyway
B	yes
B	oh okay
A	is she telling you that?
B	no no erm well apparently
A	oh yeah
B	of course
A	I saw the photos of her
B	oh did you?
A	oh
B	oh oh she she's
A	CCTV stills
B	she was gonna send me to them
A	she she took these stills so she's put them up in the office now
B	yeah
A	just in case anybody sees her coming and
B	yeah
A	all that stuff
B	yes
A	well apparently erm
B	oh
A	to
B	oh
A	and
A	I know and
B	I know yeah
A	which
B	I think she's got to address in her erm
A	yeah
B	that yes okay we need to be serving customers all the time but if you see something going on
B	and it's
A	life threatening to a member of staff
B	yes that you think
B	that member of staff
B	is possibly going to get punched in a minute
A	well she said
B	I mean yeah
A	she'd just been into the you know this she's got that woman who works just in the office?
B	mm
A	and that won't serve?
B	mm
A	apparently she said to
B	oh really?
B	mm
A	erm finished off a few procedures and I said well it's probably cos she feels now that she's doing something that's worthwhile
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	cos the other woman wasn't bothered about the reports and wasn't filing anything
B	no
A	so what was the point of her doing it? because you're on it and you're asking her for it
B	yeah
A	she's got something now to do fill her time again and
B	yeah
A	it does make a difference to people
B	absolutely
A	but apparently she's giving everybody a charm on at Sunday's meeting
B	oh really?
B	yeah
A	a heart charm or something and I says
B	yeah
A	so don't worry about the hundred and thirty quid ring you've just got stolen
A	and she goes yeah you're right actually
A	and then she says I wonder if I can get a charm I
B	no she's just they they don't care it's just it was the whole physical act of violence
A	yes
B	that was that had
A	upsetting
B	really upset her rather than
A	yeah
B	I said to her don't you know so
A	oh no she's not bothered about the ring no she's
B	she's got nothing absolutely nothing to the company
A	so she's erm she's got to give everybody a charm
B	oh yeah? yeah
A	and she's to take breakfast there's twenty-five of them
A	so I said well go and get a selection of donuts croissants
B	yeah yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	well we're not eating them on the shop floor we haven't got to time to get
A	I said
A	I said come on
A	so I'm not sure how that's gonna go down
B	can't they have a meeting in the office?
A	well that's what I said apparently it's not big enough for all of them
B	oh
A	cos there's er there's twenty-five of them
B	can she claim breakfast on the company?
A	oh yes yes it'll all be
B	well take them to Costa next door then
B	just do it from there
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	if she can claim it all back obviously then
A	yes so er
B	whack it in there oh dear
A	so she's got to be miss popular on Sunday morning then charms croissants
A	and she's
A	said good job it's not a charm of a foot then
B	of for goodness' sake
B	she's
A	she's funny she says I thought that was really good what do you think? I said I think that's excellent
A	she thought of that all by herself
B	excellent
A	very pleased with her opening line
B	oh dear
A	we'll see how that goes down
A	dunno what time they open on Sunday ten or eleven I suppose
B	yeah
A	they open late at the
B	yeah she was saying that they're not open as or are they open later?
A	was it about half nine before or ten before they open on every day?
B	yes yeah yeah she'll probably change that before long
A	I don't know that
B	the
A	I'm I'm not sure how yeah how that works
B	mm
A	you'd think there's no need to open sooner if there's no
B	don't know
A	cos she gets there for half eight every morning
B	mm
A	so she must have an hour tidying sorting the shop and
B	yeah
A	telling people what to do
B	uhu
A	but yeah
B	she'll be alright anyway
B	oh yeah
A	oh
B	yes
A	oh
B	well yeah she just that she said Saturday morning to me so I could do an hour on Saturday morning that would be nothing
A	so Tuesdays have finished?
B	I think so yeah cos she can't
A	cos yes she
B	mm
A	cos I thought you're not going there are you? cos your petrol
B	no no I'm not going there
A	it would cost you too much said she'll have to get her to you so I that's what I said to her otherwise I think
B	no it's not worth the money
A	well there the other option is you see they'd probably pay your petrol
B	they would pay
B	the the petrol yeah but then I'm thinking well then it's like
A	it's a
B	it's like three hours isn't it out of my
A	yeah a couple of hours yeah yeah it's a good well forty-five minutes over there yeah
B	yeah so I'd leave an hour before
A	yeah yeah
B	then I'd have an hour there then it would be
A	no it's not worth it is it? don't wanna do that on a Saturday
B	no not on a Saturday morning when I I haven't really I don't really wanna do Saturdays anyway
A	no I don't blame you
B	and we don't do anything on Saturday so it's not as if I can't
A	she said that
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	well that's what she just said that she she well she said
A	oh
B	I'll give you a call
A	right
B	and I'll speak to
A	yeah
B	and yeah we'll see what
A	er cos I think if it's a Saturday I bet she'd get
B	yeah
A	and then you could always you could always come to ours if your dad's around mind you dad often works on a Saturday so
B	yeah
B	yeah he would be yeah
A	probably would be better in
B	mm
A	cos that's what he'd do he'd just go down
B	yeah yeah
A	to the office for any hour
B	yeah
B	we'd be calling him after the hour so
A	well we would actually yeah that's the trouble
B	yeah with
A	or we'd take her up there
B	yeah or I could go to the office see if he'd put the heating on
A	yeah that's true
B	and tutor her there
A	yeah
B	then I could leave after the hour
A	yes that's not a bad idea either is it?
B	no
A	you've got the wi-fi there and all the computers
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah no we'll see
A	well that's worth a suggestion if
B	yeah definitely
A	cos he'd be much happier then he'd he'd spend his hour doing something
B	mm
A	I mean he's slow at everything he he might make a payment in that hour or something like that
B	mm
B	oh
A	I said okay you've moved on you've left it behind now I thought right er that's probably his his words so fair enough
B	yeah
A	she says the bank were being very unhelpful and she said er she
A	got no idea what things cost and I said
B	yeah
A	I said they base it on the erm the value of the letter of credit is based on the the value of the money
B	yeah
A	that they're they're putting on there so usually the turnover of the job or the turnover's four million I said isn't it to
B	yeah
A	I said so on a job of
A	and I said erm
B	yeah
A	then take a chunk
B	uhu
A	I says so this is nothing
B	they obviously have no idea do they?
A	compared to you know
B	yeah
A	they do a good deal actually compared to what Natwest were offering
B	mm
A	she was horrified
B	yeah
A	I says so they're not ripping you off I said that's about right and it's about standard and that's what you've gotta pay
B	yeah
A	you know twenty grand on four million for fees is is nothing
B	is nothing no
A	oh she said right
A	but the thing was you see
B	no
A	they never factored any contingency and they just looked at the pipe
B	yeah
A	looked what they were selling at and looked what it was costing them and they forget that
A	they've got all sorts of charges with delivery when the wagons break down and the crates can't offload and you end up getting what they call a demurrage charge which is wagons hanging around cranes break down so the charges back up massively so that's a big
B	yeah yeah
A	maybe twenty thirty on a job this size and then you've got the bank fees like I say twenty twenty-five thousand so when
B	mm
A	you can halve it again by the time he's taken and that's what they never did
B	no
A	so they'll cut the profit to get the job and then
B	that's yeah
A	will eat into it
A	they don't really so if
A	and now he's doing it from scratch on a four million pound job
B	oh god
A	good luck Mr
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	uhu
A	well er will you pay earlier if if we give you a ten percent discount on that one? and then they will
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	I never did that I me and
B	yeah
A	they paid
B	oh dear
A	and he'll pay him the commission he's promised him about fifty grand on that I imagine easily he's gonna pay
B	right
A	so he'll be left with nothing again except a debt
B	yeah
A	and hopefully they'll get the next one which I think is gonna be more local
B	uhu
A	for a few weeks
B	yeah
A	it'll be good money then
B	yeah
A	cos he'd asked
A	he'd asked
B	asked oh he's asked
A	well he's still knocking around he was at work when
B	oh really?
A	so he said to
B	oh
A	he was asking dad's advice
B	oh
A	he sent me photos of it twelve months ago
B	yeah
A	I says been going on about this for ages what
B	oh
A	do you think I should do
B	oh
A	can probably afford a property by now he should do it
B	yeah yeah
A	good investment in
B	yeah
A	if you know if you know if he wanted
B	uhu
A	and
B	that's right yeah okay
A	they're back using
B	mm
A	and
B	no
A	it's too big a job
B	yeah
A	and then
A	so
B	mm oh dear
A	I says she says he's he's a bit older than
A	said he's or he's might be fifty
B	yeah
A	oh she said and yeah he's younger and she's she looked I said well I've met him loads of times
B	yeah
A	oh oh right she said she looked a bit vague and I says
B	yeah
A	I said well he gets on well with
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	I said he likes
B	oh dear
A	she went oh really? I says yes the last I heard he was living with his mother at the age of fifty
B	oh no
A	so he's desperate for work
B	oh god
A	and
A	well he was doing that when I left and nothing's come of it yet so it's
B	oh
A	two years down the line so yeah of course he's
B	she has no idea
B	oh it's
A	well she's still got no idea
B	no
A	so it just made me smile you have to and I said to her erm I said oh poor old
B	mm
A	said well he's broken his leg so I stopped short of saying it was your husband that bought him out of hospital I
B	oh
A	yes that's why I assumed she you know
B	oh god
A	he might have mentioned oh guess what I did today
B	oh really? and
A	well the you know when we saw
B	no no no
A	oh cos I went after to the airport with
B	yeah
B	I
A	and his foot?
B	no I don't know about
A	oh I see oh no it was when I got to the airport then and
B	oh
A	I says oh no and
B	okay bit strange
A	and then she said he came out on it was Thursday and I says Thursday about midday? she goes yeah that's right
B	oh yeah
A	your dad at the
B	yeah yeah oh yeah oh
A	and I said I saw
B	it was
A	and he was kind of
B	oh yeah
A	bringing
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	we saw
B	yeah
A	oh and I of course cos I've been on holiday I've not told you and then
B	oh okay
A	me
B	yeah
A	and when I got off the plane I saw this chat
B	mm
A	it had just started up and they'd
B	yeah
A	all day followed by well I dunno where the girls are probably on holiday again
A	and then
B	oh yeah obviously
A	I'm in
B	oh
B	mm
A	so erm he says oh yeah they are so
B	oh
A	bruised apparently he said
B	nice
A	to
A	went out for casual game with some of the dads and er
B	yeah
A	ended up doing this well of course he's due to start his new job on Monday
B	oh yeah and he
A	can't drive
A	so he wasn't really sure he was hoping they were gonna be accommodating and put it all on hold for him
B	yeah
A	er but he's just sitting around at home so far as I know
B	oh really?
A	so I'll have to have a little we chatted last week while we were out cos he was asking how it was going and he was obviously bored and he sent a photo of me holding skis and he says she hasn't been on those has she? and
A	so yeah so I assumed from that that
B	yeah
A	that she was in what? oh what happened? I thought oh and so I didn't say well
A	you don't do you?
B	no
A	I gave up a long time ago saying what
B	yeah
A	then she gets annoyed that she doesn't know
A	so
B	yeah oh
A	I said but he's in Scotland
B	yeah
A	yeah well that's the story going around isn't it?
B	er?
A	that's
B	oh
A	the state of him
A	made me laugh

B	mm
A	to work after
A	ages ago sorry?
B	mm
A	oh we'll need to decide then on what we're doing Mother's day cos you had mentioned cooking at one point but I need to get in touch with mum cos
A	unless we give her notice she'll say well I didn't know you were doing anything
B	yes
B	ah so he
A	all you've got
B	yeah he was
A	all you've got to do is join up on the website and you can have all these free lessons but I know he was one of the ones who'd been asked to coach
B	yes uhu
B	uhu
B	no they're just
A	and
B	oh wow
A	which she was surprised about because
B	mm

B	I know it is
A	I know I know a little while ago you'd said oh come to me but
B	yeah
A	whether you're still on that or whether you I do have to decide

A	we have to include nan really don't we?
B	yes
A	or at least invite her
B	hello you
A	especially of
B	mm
A	let's think so there'd be if
B	uhu
A	I mean I don't mind at mine that's not a
B	no I'll do it
A	problem or you can cook at mine if you want or you just it doesn't
B	yeah it's just that it's yeah I was thinking the other day be good if we all came here and then I just I was thinking of my oven and the fact that only one of them works it's a blinking nightmare when you're trying to cook for more than about four people because
B	but I can't er if I cook something on the bottom
A	have you had that oven looked at? you were gonna get it you
B	yeah I know oh we haven't got we haven't got the money to just
A	oh
B	when it when it just works like
A	yeah just for you
B	and we can just get by
A	yeah
B	then it's fine yeah
A	well you can come to mine
B	have a think
A	it's just more money

A	we are in August
B	yeah
A	but the week we've got booked in June we're going

A	it's a very early start though although
B	ah
A	cos we didn't know when it's just
B	take him up on it then
A	well yeah I might do
B	there you go
A	cos we thought we'd check out leaving the car there for a week but if it wasn't too much
B	oh
A	we arrive back at one o'clock in the daytime which is nice it's just the going out there
B	yeah yeah
A	and I imagine when we do Wizz we'll take the car down but we've got erm the Wizz flights were were pretty good
B	what days are you out there in August?

B	okay
A	but it'll be a different day from
B	this isn't working very well
A	why's that?
B	to search for a flight on here
A	oh
B	nothing's coming up as a choice or
A	we're getting new internet today with Sky but it's going through the phone line
B	yeah

B	great
B	so it's gonna be like back to the

B	old days of not having you can't well it might work out in your favour actually if you can't make a call while you're on the internet cos then grandma will never be able to get through
B	well I don't know actually because that's how it always used to work wasn't it? it was always
A	I hadn't thought about that oh don't tell your dad that'll be good though
B	yeah
A	we're not using the we've got no free calls any more so we're not using the phone
B	oh right
A	I think we might even have a new number

A	he's bound to tell her though isn't he?
B	probably erm oh no I want to go on the
A	it's the only phone number
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	it's typical with your father I'm sure he could have pushed for it not to be changed but
B	what what what is this doing? right
A	is
B	no
A	oh
B	this is just
A	is it the site? which site are you on? Wizz or Thomas Cook?
B	Thomas Cook
A	do you
B	search
A	cos he won't need a seat
B	you have to put that they're in
A	oh I see
B	nonstop available well we don't want to stop anyway
B	obviously
A	er have you not gone on the Thomas Cook website? it's much easier
B	I'm on the Thomas Cook website

A	next available one
B	mm
A	oh ninety-two look at that
B	ninety-two per person
A	no that's good
B	and
A	add a week onto that
A	click your arrow
B	yep oh two seventy-four still
A	oh
A	oh coming back's too expensive
B	mm
A	erm the other option is to come back with a different airline
B	yeah Wizz
