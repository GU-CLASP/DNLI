A	and then he may of realised that he'd made a bit of a mistake
B	yeah does he live in Spain now?

B	I feel like I should find it more stressful but I am tired it's tiring but you don't have uni to go to as well you don't have dissertations to do I saw someone one a train writing a dissertation and I was like I'll never have to do that again
A	like having Christmas without having homework
B	yes that's been nice did you have a good New Year in the end?
A	I did I went to
D	yeah
A	she's blonde they're both blonde basically the same person and yeah we went to this pub it was only a fiver and I thought it was going to be sedate but it was a really modern pub and there were loads of people there and it had this huge dance floor so it was basically like being in a club but I only paid a fiver
B	that's cool
D	good
B	better than last year you didn't enjoy it last year
A	well I don't remember it
D	last year I made a puzzle globe last year that's tragic
B	oh no
A	were you ill or something?
D	my plans fell through I gave dad a puzzle globe for Christmas and I had nothing else to do so I made the globe and sat there
B	oh sounds better than my New Year last year I paid fifty quid for this really cool evening in London
A	I remember
B	an then we got completely wasted before we even left the flat I don't remember anything during the night and I apparently made a fool of myself apparently I insulted
A	oh dear
B	anyway tell me about
B	and did you meet him did how where were you?
A	basically I got this part time job when I was a language student I got this part time job
B	in a school did you enjoy doing that by the way?
A	yes I enjoyed it I enjoyed it I think and it was only twelve hours a week and I was getting eight hundred euros a month so that's nice not too bad but I don't think I'd do teaching I think I've done my year
B	and that's enough
A	because I did quite enjoy planning lessons and stuff but the kids just wouldn't cooperate they were like
B	they were older weren't they?
A	they were so unimaginative so I planned this lesson where they had to create a TV show
B	how old were they?
A	they were sixteen and I thought oh that would be an interesting way for them to get active
B	yeah
A	so I put them into groups and I said plan a TV show you've got half an hour and they're so unimaginative in Germany they sit there they just sat there at the table and they were all writing and there was silence and I was like guys you don't have to write you can talk to each other but they just couldn't grasp this fact that they didn't write stuff down and that they couldn't be creative and that showed they were really boring they were really dull I said
B	did they have to speak in English to you?
A	they had to speak in English yeah they had to do like a cookery show and like a chat show and something else and I thought that would be really fun but they didn't get it they didn't understand the whole concept of it
B	yeah
A	so anyway that was a bit of a disaster hey ho but I had this part time job as a waitress in this restaurant and it's owned by
B	did he have a girlfriend at work though?
A	he had a girlfriend at works he but he broke up with her like two weeks before
B	said two week ago
A	yeah she was Hungarian and yeah he followed me out one night he followed me out one day when I was leaving and he said by the way
B	that's funny
A	I went to pub and actually really enjoyed myself and we went out for dinner again a few days later
B	you didn't put makeup on?
A	that time I did and make myself look nice and yeah we saw each other every single day always doing stuff together
B	did you speak German with him?
A	yeah we always speak German with each other and then he took me out for a weekend away in Poland
B	that's so nice
A	in a five star hotel with a bar and everything
B	nice find
A	and I was still going into it thinking it'll be fun for a month and then at the end we were like oh we don't want to break up so he booked a flight to come and see me cos I was between Germany and Peru and that was really cool and we were like okay still want to be with you and we carried on the relationship while we were in Peru and we Skype all the time and he came to visit me yeah
B	yeah I saw the photos
D	does he speak English at all?
A	he does speak English he speaks English French and German
B	oh my god
A	cos he trained as a chef in France yeah he trained as a chef in France so he speaks French as well
B	is his English good?
B	his English is good I mean he makes a few mistakes but nothing major
A	do you speak to him in German?
A	yeah unless we're like when we're with my parents we speak English we
B	that's amazing that you can do that
A	he's sending me love letters and they're really cute things like origami hearts and stuff like that
B	oh god
A	one of the letters was in German and then in English and the last page was in French and I said to him I can't read the last page and he was like oh you have to work out yourself so I had to do on google translate which took ages had to type it all up but yeah that was quite romantic
B	romantic
A	yeah but then for my birthday he did this really cute thing he left like a week two weeks before my birthday and we were going to do presents in February when I was going to go out there and so anyway I went down and the doorman said oh I've got something here for you and he gave me freeze dried rose which was given to me and a card saying happy birthday I came and he'd given a present to the maid cos we had a maid in our room and put on my bed like and so there was a present and a card and I was like oh that's cute but it wasn't just that I opened that and then the card said right go into your computer and open this password protected document but you've got to find the password which was referring to our last love letter so I had to go and get the last love letter out and find this password which spelt out I love you
B	oh my god
A	and then the word document right now you've got to find
D	was he in the country?
A	no he'd left already
B	oh
D	darling PS I love you
A	look where your last present was but deeper so I looked under the bed and it was there and I thought oh it's another present is this the last one? and there was a card
B	pass the parcel
A	yeah and I was like when's this going to end and I opened the card and it said right now you've been searching for a long time I think you need a drink go to this pub and buy this particular drink so I was like oh what's there what's waiting there for me? so my friend and I went to this particular pub but unfortunately it had closed down the day before
D	oh no
A	cos it was open the night before cos I saw it and there was just a big sign on the door saying we have closed down for the foreseeable future so I was like oh great so I'm never going to get what was left so anyway a few days later I left a note on the door that said if you see this can you give me a ring cos I really I think my boyfriend left a present with you and anyway he rang me and said yeah come and collect it so it didn't quite work out the way
B	what was it?
A	and that was the end of the treasure hunt erm it was it's like so it sounds really weird it's like a block of plastic in a kind of a cube shape and at the back of the plastic is a picture of us
D	oh okay I know the kind of you can slot it in
A	no it's inside
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh wow
D	aw that's cute so romantic
B	how old is he?
A	twenty-eight
B	oh my god I hear wedding bells
D	did he propose on Machu Picchu?
A	no
B	did you really think he would?
A	I don't think I would of said yes anyway as it's a bit early but
B	how long have you been together?
A	since the beginning of May
B	that's amazing
A	the first day he arrived cos we'd never said I love you before
B	but in letters you had
A	no I hadn't ever said it and I thought I don't want to do it over Skype I want to do it when we see each other oh I said it first and he was like oh I really hate you and I was like why? and said cos I planned to say it on Machu Picchu and I was like sorry you can still say it on Machu Picchu yeah but it's not going to be sweet now is it?
B	oh that's so romantic well
D	yeah he's always been good like that not like planned like a now I feel like a bad girlfriend cos he does all these things and I just
B	that's what they're meant to do that's their role
D	yeah I know
A	when he came it was his birthday in October when he came in November I bought him a cake with a candle and put some music on and bought myself some new underwear
B	did you?
A	and I made him go have a shower when he arrived so that I could that I could plan it all
B	that's nice though
A	he loved that
B	so what's the plan is he going to come here what's the plan?
A	well I don't want to move to Germany and I want him to move to London with me
D	he could start a restaurant
A	he could do that thing is he works in the restaurant with his parents and they're really quite pushy that he stays in the restaurant cos it's like a family business and I said what would happen if he left
B	wow
A	so I don't know what's going to happen
B	mind you imagine they're not there what do you want?
A	I should have that conversation
D	dream
A	when he next came up imagine I'm going out to Germany for the twentieth of January for two weeks and then
D	so you're freelancing so to be honest I don't think you can really have a job
A	no I've got an interview on the twelfth here in London not here here but in London and so hopefully if I get that job which I hope but I might not get it they won't want me until February anyway but I can always say sorry I've got a holiday booked can I start in February?
D	yeah what's the job?
A	it's in it's called
D	wow
A	it's only a six month job
D	how did you get that then?
A	well when before I went to uni I wrote letters to loads and loads of publishing companies and most of them emailed me back with loads of rejections and there were a few really positive ones where I did work experience so what I did was the other month I emailed them all again cos I still had all their emails and I emailed them all again and I said I did my work experience with them and here's my CV and I've since been to uni and done all this and blah blah if there's any opportunities please let me know and this girl emailed me back saying yes we're looking to fill an internship from kind of the new year if you're available and we'll have a look at your CV and say if you're suitable and a few days later she emailed me back and said yes we'd like to see you
D	that's good
B	wow
A	but I don't know how many people
D	what job would it be in the company do you have any idea?
A	I think it's like agency for the literary department so I'm not sure exactly what I'll be doing
D	the dreams
A	yeah
B	get a job and then move to London
D	and then you're like you can't move to Germany you're going to have to move here
A	yeah well he knows I'm looking for jobs in London anyway so I'm hoping he'll just break and just come and he did say to me the other day and just come and he did say to me the other day on Skype if only I could give everything up to come to London with you and I was like mm that's a promising sign and I was like yeah that would be lovely
D	can he make the family business go bust?
A	oh nightmare
D	he could extend it it could be international it could be the same company but in London I mean how long is it to get there from here what's the flight?
A	it's like an hour and a half
B	that's good and once you've done all your travelling in between what does that equate to like how far is he from the airport?
A	well if I fly to Berlin it's two hours from the airport if I fly to Leipzig if I flew to Dresden it's like half an hour like I would never consider flying to Dresden erm Leipzig is about two hours the opposite direction and he's picking me up form Leipzig when I go in January and we're going to go to his sister who lives in Switzerland and stay there for a few days well two days
B	you're like living the dream
D	did you go skiing?
A	I did in Germany in February yeah in Bavaria it was really fun but I kept falling off it was quite hard actually yeah did I tell you? right you really need to watch and I was doing it really slowly each time and I was like I've just got to let myself go and I was like just help me here and got to the top and I just let go and I was like the first I did it I got right to the end and I still haven't got anything to slow myself so I just used to sit on my bum and that used to stop myself so I'd just sit down before I bumped into the queue of people at the bottom so anyway I thought that was cool I'll do that again to I did it again and there was like a man who was doing a skiing lesson with kids and he could see and they started to skate across as I was coming down
D	yeah they do that they start skating across
A	and I was like oh my god I can't stop and I moved a tiny bit and fortunately I hit the teacher and not any of the kids and I bashed my head and I had a headache for the whole day and I bashed my head on the snow but fortunately I didn't take out any four year olds
D	bad
A	not as bad as it could of been
B	ho was
A	no he was fine cos he's like an experienced skier
B	did you speak to him in French of German?
A	no he was American actually he was like oh you got to be more careful I was like sorry
D	I'm a novice
A	they just stand on the slope having a chat they don't get out the way
B	so funny
A	whereabouts in France?
D	I guess she's quite fat
B	yeah that's true
A	I could never get I always had to take my skis off cos I could never get myself up I do have poor body strength to do that to do it from your tummy yeah so I couldn't do that
B	did it go on the you know when you sit down?
A	yeah I did that nightmare if you fall off it's like damn it
D	so you're here you going to do your freelancing you're going to try and get that job
A	yes but I've only got one interview lined up so if that fails I'm back to square one cos I've been applying for so many jobs
D	I think you've got a good chance I think they'll really the fact that you've applied and that you applied again shows commitment
A	keen yeah she sent me a load of authors that they agent for which I've got to research and stuff so I suppose I better do that I better find some nice shoes
D	just don't go in in those trainers
B	what happened to your other shoes?
A	I don't have any more I used to have some black shoes that I used to wear to work every day in Peru but I wore them every single day and they just got holes in the end
A	well it's the sales
D	shoes are important
A	yeah it's just that this month cos I don't get cos I've been doing races as well you know I did races I did
D	is that when you're on the tills?
A	yeah
D	is that when you take the next bets out
A	yeah so I did one I did one at
A	get any good tips?
A	no rubbish and yesterday I did one at
D	no definitely get this job
A	get a job
A	if I don't accept it and don't get the job then I haven't got
B	can you accept it and then if you get the job?
A	I could yeah I could but I don't want to get a reputation for bad and then they might not offer me any more work cos it is quite good to do it on Saturdays and stuff when you're free
B	but if you got a job then you won't need any more work
A	yeah true I won't enjoy it though I might want to carry on doing it I might want to do
B	mine's been shit cos they've paid on the twenty-third December did they do that with you?
A	yeah
B	it's really annoying
A	I hate it when that happens
B	that dent I made in the car
D	where did you make that?
B	I made it in October I was so good at keeping it a secret from my parents
A	why is it your car or theirs?
B	it's theirs and all the times I kept it quiet and I was like I kept it quiet all the time I made them park it somewhere and then walk round to my house everything literally and then at Christmas oh I'm going to wash the cars and I was like oh no I'll do mine
A	very stressful for you having that
B	and I was like I know it was and I said I was like no seriously I was like you know give me that car you know I'm paying it off
D	I'll wash it
B	I must do it and then dad the next morning before I woke up was like how did you do the dent? why don't I know about it? and I learn from my mistakes I very much do and I was like in my head hide the dent but dad was like that was so stupid because you can't claim for it on the insurance now because you have to claim in two weeks
D	not that you'd want to either you wouldn't want to claim against that
A	it's probably cheaper to get it
B	nightmare the mechanics and I've now I've paid dad off and the insurance is a nightmare with my points
A	you've got points
D	why have you got points?
B	speeding I'm sure I told you that ages ago and then we sent it to the mechanic and we're still waiting for them to do work on it cos the excess and the insurance is five hundred pounds and I don't want anyone else the insurers to know if it's under five hundred fine just going to sort it out myself even if it's six hundred I will pay and the man was initially no it's fine we'll bash it out and then he looked at it again and actually the alignment's really not great and he was like turn on your headlights and so I turned them on and cos it was slightly bashed one of them on the brick wall was like here the other one was here it's like it's definitely not right so I haven't told dad that yet
A	oh no
B	so I haven't told dad that yet oh it's a nightmare and I couldn't go on the driver awareness course because I was too much over the limit which I think is really wrong because
D	course
B	you should have to go on the course and get points but no no
D	you're the one that needs it
B	so you just have to have the points
A	there's always something with cars
B	dad said to me there's no point buying a new car cos a new driver driving out of the forecourt losing value something crazy like it loses two and a half grand just by driving out of the car park so that was a bit of a nightmare before Christmas
D	my engine light came on again did I tell you about the engine light?
A	you're not in the Clio any more?
B	yeah
A	you are?
B	Clio
D	Cleopatra
D	the engine light came on we were driving down to Dorset me and
B	I know that one overheating
D	pulled over and it could be absolutely anything and if it's not red it should be fine
B	did you find somewhere when you got to Dorset?
D	of course we couldn't find anywhere in Dorset and ended up going all the way back to Reading and it was something really stupid like and when I went back to Bristol for Christmas and when I got onto the motorway engine light went on
D	oh my
A	it's really frightening on the motorway no it was orange if it was red I would of stopped my dad picked my tyres and they were a bit flat and said what shall I do? and he was like oh they'll be alright
D	put air in them
B	that was costing a lot more petrol
D	yeah I get scared of doing that cos I never know if I'm doing it right I'm paranoid I don't know the amount I get a stranger to do it I act like oh I don't know
A	I'm like every now and then my dad checks my car cos he knows I don't check it cos I never check anything once I'm out of the car I forget about the car once I shut the door off you go
D	yeah
A	I never checked my oil and I've had my car for about five years
D	but it flashes up oil on my dashboard okay when I stop the engine so I'm like great anyway the other day I was going to come home and go to my sister's for dinner and then drive back from my sister's to Reading driving to my sister's it was like der der der anti lock kn the breaks and that grinding sound
A	sound quite scary
D	I was thinking what was this I said to my dad and
A	my anti locking comes in really quickly and that really scares me
B	what is it?
D	it's like if you're breaking quite hard anti locking is there to slow you down in my head this is the road rather than slowly slowing down it's trying to work hardest it's going der der der breaking harder on each bit it's fucking terrifying that was when I went into the rails with that dent der der der
B	seriously
D	yeah it's fine drove back to Reading my dad
B	railings yeah do
D	so I drove it back to Reading and when I got onto the motorway it was really raining and there were vans and then my ABS light comes on my dashboard and there's a problem with my anti lock breaking system and it's in the garage and it's all the time it's service coming up
D	shit done to it again
B	what my dad said can't always be paying for your car
A	I just pay the car really so they had to pay the tax and the other day I was driving back from somewhere I don't know where I was driving back from oh yeah
B	a lot of them don't have film in
A	yeah I'm hoping that hasn't happened it's bad enough them catching me speeding but it's also bad if it's the day I got tax the next day but that was the day that I was speeding
B	oh so annoying
A	I'm always so careful with it cos I know where the speed cameras so I always go down to thirty
D	and I'm pretty sure I've been in the car with you when you're driving slowly anyway
A	yeah and I'm not a speeder I'm just driving yeah I'm always so careful I always find when it's something when I'm singing along thinking yeah so when I was coming back from
B	what is the speed limit on the motorway?
A	seventy but it's
D	overtaking you always go beyond I'm always about seventy-five
A	no I was doing seventy nobody gets tickets on the motorway they're fine but there was a variable sixty so I went right down to sixty and I think other cars were going faster but erm but cos it was dark at this time there was a huge flash and I thought oh my god I hope it isn't me they're flashing I was like I am doing sixty and I was like oh my god maybe it was fifty and I read it wrong
B	if there were cars going along faster than you
A	yeah so it was flashing another car maybe cos I was like oh my god if I got caught twice for speeding in two days then that's not good news I'm so careful I've never had any points in my life or anything
B	who doesn't?
A	I can't afford to pay fines right now
B	neither can I
A	I got paid we got paid a day less we got paid on twenty-first twenty-third we had to close our accounts down so we got paid three hundred and fifty dollars so I had that to bring home for me and it was only like a hundred and fifty pounds or something and so I've had to last me this month which is mostly like gone and
A	yeah oh wow doing well then
B	well I suppose you're back with your parents you're not paying rent
A	well I didn't have to pay rent in Peru because it was provided with our internship and when we worked it out we were working ten hours a day five days a week so we were working fifty hours a week and I was getting two hundred pounds the equivalent of getting paid in dollars but they couldn't so it worked out I was being paid a pound an hour but then we have got we have our flat provided and we got health insurance with that that we did actually end up using
B	why what was wrong?
A	erm I think must have used I woke up one day and I was being sick and I couldn't go into work and then I erm I thought I got a bug and then the next day I had diarrhoea and it had blood in it
B	oh
A	and I thought maybe and anyway this happened for a whole day and I got to the point where there was nothing to come out either end but it was still trying to come out and really painful so I rang my mum and she was like maybe go to the hospital so I went to the hospital and I went into the doctor's and it sounds like you've got cos here we have bacteria in food that we sometimes get and it sounds like you've got a bacterial infection so I'll give you antibiotics and if it gets worse just comes back the next week so I took the antibiotics and it cleared up so it must have been an infection erm but yeah so I used that but they paid not for the doctor so I had to pay to go to the doctor and to have to pay fifty soles which was only about ten pounds and then I had to pay for my antibiotics which were like twenty soles which is only like four pounds which I guess isn't that much but seventy soles is in Peru it goes a lot further than it does in England cos everything's a lot cheaper so it was like oh god
B	it's like that all over America and obviously you pay you can't afford it you just want to be done with it
A	it would have been so much more expensive cos that was only ten percent with my health insurance that was only ten percent of what the actual cost was so I was like oh my god I wouldn't of been able to pay that if I didn't have my insurance always worth getting insurance if your dog has insurance
D	oh but they cost a fortune too
A	yeah and my parents did that they had eight hundred pounds for my cat's paw to have like a skin graft
D	how much?
