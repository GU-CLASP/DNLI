C	we took the drive thinking that
B	oh well oh well
C	but we only we were only looking at the barn but he took us
D	well not really but
C	I mean it he'd been round all those rooms that er and the things he's
B	haven't seen inside the house but
A	oh
C	oh it's
A	and what's nice
C	yes
B	but outside is
A	he's employed all local people
C	yeah
A	and
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah
C	did he have a wedding there?
B	and a stonemason from
A	yeah sorry?

A	he did
B	yeah
C	he did?
A	the builder yeah
C	er in in July
A	yeah
B	mm
C	so they were hoping to get it finished by then
B	well that's why he managed to get it finished on time cos the builders
B	daughter getting married
D	good incentive isn't it?
C	yeah they said that we could have had the barn on in for the wedding
B	mm
C	but it's it wasn't suitable for us
A	no
B	no
C	and those big heavy tables are very fixed
B	mm
D	mm
A	mm
C	erm
B	no I mean it
C	but absolutely superb
B	mm
A	well we thought about having a barn dance there
C	amazing
A	because I've had one or two of them
B	cos he offered to move the tables out
A	yeah
C	oh did he?
A	mm
C	gosh
B	he's got loads of chairs there
A	but it
C	yeah
A	he will actually benefit from that because
B	yeah
A	the more people will think oh this'll be a great venue for a whatever
C	no cos that venue is not for people around here that that
B	what do you mean? of
C	venue is for
B	well there's lots
A	I've had I've had three
B	there's a lot of money about
A	I've had three
C	yeah but yeah but
B	oh oh
C	you're talking you're talking sort of the Clooney and Amal whatsit type wedding where they spend six million
A	mm
B	there's no reason why you can't just hire the barn out though er
C	well I don't think he's do it probably
B	but why not?
C	not without all the other
A	oh they will
B	he would he just hired a barn
C	I mean he'd do it to pop stars
A	he will
B	of course he would he's I think he'd be happier doing that than he would
A	no he would yeah
B	cos there's less hassle
D	really?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he didn't want the hassle really his wife certainly doesn't
A	no
D	mm
C	what? well why's he doing it then if he doesn't want the hassle? I mean it's absolutely superb
B	well I
A	they will move out
B	he didn't realise how much hassle it was
A	for a weekend
C	but I thought they had moved out
A	for the weekend the venue functions
C	have they moved back in? cos they had moved
A	they're there part time they're there at the weekend
D	so where do they live?
C	I mean it's beyond anyone's dreams that place and it's
B	no
C	yeah have you been round it?
B	it'll be
C	dare you dare you to go round it
B	at least like twenty thousand
C	what for what the whole thing?
B	mm for the for the house and the
C	and the bridal suite up the very top?
B	yeah yeah
C	twenty thousand?
B	that's what I heard off the record
C	I think that is very very cheap
C	where did he go to school then?
B	what's it er at erm
B	yeah
C	oh I'm sure
A	down there
D	mm
D	oh right
A	they they're living in the house next up

A	erm if you go to erm
D	yeah

D	right
A	and then the road shoots back down to the right and it's on the left hand side up at the top there's a barn
B	we we've erm I've seen
C	but I love that bloke who showed us round what's his name? erm
B	it's a nice place

B	yes he is he'll fill it yeah
C	well we we were doing a whistle stop tour of the venues
C	yeah
B	mm
C	for things and we we had about ten minutes to see the barn there and we were there two and a half hours
A	do you know what his mission in life is at the moment?
C	what?
A	to rebrand
C	mm
A	you know he owns the old S HSBC which is now a café?
C	the bank?
A	the bank
D	mm
C	oh does he?

A	he's also well I went in with him actually he was walking out I said come I'll buy you a coffee in your bank and then
C	have they got nice coffee in there?
A	it's very nice yeah
D	they've got school desks and chairs
B	yeah
A	I know that's the other thing I'm not quite it looks a bit like
B	no I'm not treated to yeah yeah yeah
A	it's a bit like they've chucked cos there's so many
D	mm
A	it just looks like they're trying
B	I know
A	to sell it
D	I mean it's
B	but
D	yeah
A	they've also bought the card shop on
D	but it's it's sort of been going
A	on the main
C	sorry which one?
A	there's a card shop on as you're walking up towards
C	mm
B	mm
A	down the main bit
B	on the right
A	yeah on the right hand side
C	on the right right okay
A	yeah
B	it's that goes back
A	he's slowly buying up some of the shops there and what he wants to do is to turn them round so that what is the horrible backs
D	mm
A	becomes a really nice front
B	good for him because I mean the
A	well or try to
B	the planners have made a real mess of
A	oh
B	I mean when I first came to
A	they've got a lot to answer for
B	and it was quite good
A	yeah
B	er and they just progressively destroyed it
A	mm
B	and it's the planners at
A	mm
B	I mean they've knocked all the
C	not not
A	no
C	not Mrs
B	oh I mean
A	he lived in
B	no no I don't don't think so he lives in er
A	oh no I'm thinking of someone else
B	lives in
A	right
B	but he he used to teach history at er
A	oh okay
B	but he was head of house at
A	mm
B	and so she got to know him quite well but he was you know he was passionate about old
A	oh okay
B	but he he you know it is it's terrible the way it's being destroyed really
A	mm
B	er you know
A	yeah
B	administrations at
A	well yeah
C	I was telling
B	yeah
C	the greengrocers which was what
C	well er
A	oh
B	and before that
C	before that it was Burton's actually
B	er before that
C	well it was Burton's actually well before
B	yeah
C	and we used to we used to go in and my mum used to drive us all in as kids in her erm
A	no no
C	but that was the main street
B	mm
C	it wasn't all built around where the
B	no no no
D	cos
C	no that's not completely true
D	oh not completely true
C	it's not true
B	but the I mean
C	and you'd go in there and your and mother would
D	and she has a pony you know
C	would order the
B	yeah
C	would order the erm
B	er but the
C	would order the food for the week
A	for the sake of those people that can't see what's going on here
B	it's not on is it now anyway?
C	yeah it is
B	oh is it? oh
B	not for the first time
A	it's a bit of a strong Birmingham accent coming out
D	mm
B	yes
C	and then it would all be delivered
B	yeah that's right I mean it was
C	and sometimes if it was
B	even a weekend
C	going to be a long shop my mum was putting through cos she'd be talking and Mrs
D	mm
C	where she'd pay and they'd have all the
D	mm
C	papers on a spike
B	oh I
D	oh
B	I remember all that I remember all that
C	but I used to
D	mm
C	I used to
D	yeah
C	dash off and go down to Woolworths to spend me pocket money on a
B	oh Woolies yeah down
D	yes
C	on the latest erm record
D	mm
C	cos we used to have Woolworths there
B	yeah I remember that
D	yeah yeah
B	mm
C	and do you remember
D	and a and a Smith's and a Smith's
C	yeah there used to be a Smith's
B	Smith's where was that?
D	down
C	yeah
B	oh what?
D	opposite Woolworth's
A	yeah
D	so do you reckon this revival is gonna work?
C	and Gladworth's there used to
B	dunno I'd like to think it would because it's
D	because
B	it's a great shame they've messed it about so much
D	but it I thought it's
A	there is some really nice architectural properties
D	mm
A	in
B	yes
A	if you know what I mean I when I say the wrong place they're not in the main hub of the centre of the town the main hub the centre of the town is like you've just said
D	mm
A	the function was we want to create a little bypass round the main street so we can make it pedestrianised great idea
D	mm
A	so they take the road round the back but the road round the back then faces the back of all the shops
D	yes
B	mm
A	and I mean that could be so attractive
B	and it was originally planned to
A	to make it the shop frontage
B	yeah
D	yeah yeah
B	there was gonna be more stuff along there and they never did it I mean this is when it was first mooted
A	right
B	but originally when I first came they were gonna take the bypass the other way round and a I mean
A	oh
B	I dunno but behind there was gonna go all round the back there
A	oh
B	and come out where the lion's hut is
A	right
B	but for some reason they never did
A	mm
B	erm
A	it's a classic I mean I'm sure people doing architecture of landscaping or whatever town and country planning
B	yeah
A	how not to do it
B	well it's been quoted in several architectural books
A	has it?
B	yes
