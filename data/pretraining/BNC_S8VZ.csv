B	I've never tried to learn to be honest
A	you should erm try some of the thanks oh actually no because it's too you need a guitar to do that
B	mm
A	I was going to say go on Youtube and like try some of the self tutorials I've tried some of those and like if I watch it I can do it but then as soon as I go away or shut down the Youtube video or something
B	mm
A	just sitting there looking at it like what do I do with this
B	there's this theory and it's basically if you do ten thousand hours of something you'll become you'll be an expert at it
A	really?
B	yeah like
A	hm
B	right I don't
A	that's interesting though I guess you'd have to do it pretty much full time cos if you think about it ten thousand hours if if you're doing like an hour a week there's no way you'd become an expert
B	no
A	maybe ten thousand consecutive hours
B	mm I don't know
A	I don't know like I really love music and everything I really enjoy it but I really am just no good at it
B	ah I'm no good at singing oh I'm good at
A	that's cool ah I was the same I used to do piano lessons and then like just stopped when I moved to
B	you do don't you yeah I used to be able to read music but I can't any more
A	it's not like riding a bike when you just get on it and remember everything
B	no
A	unfortunately
B	it's one of them things that if you don't keep it up you just you just forget how to do it don't you?
A	it's really annoying though cos I used to love it and like but it was different in England like the way they did the music classes like it was so different because when I took up drums when I
B	mm
A	I was like I'm sorry that's not going to help me at all I'd rather have an extra hour playing drums and they were like no you have to
B	I used to do two
A	I just found it stupid I understand for things where you need to read music but it's like the drum sheet music you had like three colours it was the same principle like the ones that were black was one beat the ones that were white in the middle two beats like et cetera et cetera was the same thing
B	mm
A	and I was just like I don't need to sit through an hour
B	mm
A	and you'd have to read it and then bit by bit you'd have to sing so that you'd learn to recognise it and I know that's a really good skill to have but it pissed me off so much I stopped
B	yeah I'd love to learn how to play guitar
A	jesus wow
B	it's how fucking spoiled she is he literally just went out and bought her a guitar like a brand new six hundred pound guitar
A	shit
A	yeah
B	and she saved up for ages to buy herself a guitar and then obviously
A	why don't you just suggest to
B	no I'm not
A	cos you could use hers
B	I'm not giving her that fucking pleasure
A	well my uncle
B	it would be an opportunity for her to brag and be like look what I can do and I'm doing it so much faster than you like if I'm going to learn I would tell her that I were learning
A	right
B	because she'd just gloat like look how much better I am than you and just I'd rather not get into it's not a competition do you know what I mean I don't want it to become that like
A	yeah that's what it used to be like with
B	mm
A	so I'd go on Youtube tutorials or I'd just listen to a song and just try and pick it up it was just for fun
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	she always had to and like I told her I was learning this song it's like A River Flows In You by that Chinese guy I don't remember his name
B	mm
A	really beautiful and I was really struggling to learn it cos obviously I couldn't really read the music or anything so I was sort of learning learning slowly and it was when
B	mm
A	he can listen to a song and just play it
B	really?
A	and if yeah he taught himself Pirates of the Caribbean the whole way through just from listening to it
A	I know so jealous
B	yeah
A	I was just sitting there like oh
B	it ruins it doesn't it? like that's
A	it it really does it's so petty but it does it does for a ruin it for you it takes the fun out
B	yeah and that's why and that's why I don't want to tell
A	no
B	instead of it being like all the
A	mm that's why I like doing music with
B	yeah
A	and like erm there was something she wanted to do by Bombay Bicycle Club that I didn't really know and she taught me because like I listened to it a few times and then we tried singing it and doing harmonies but like my tempo was wrong
B	mm
A	because I didn't know it very well and it wasn't at all patronising or rude or anything the way she was doing it she just taught me it and then we did it together
B	yeah
A	and it wasn't a
B	it's much more fun like that though right?
A	exactly exactly
B	it's so much more fun learning together and like saying well you don't know how to do this but I do and I don't know how to do this but you do so let's just learn together let's just teach each
A	exactly
B	and it not be a competition
A	and that's what we'd always used to do and like lately because she's been teaching herself guitar a little bit she did the song on guitar and like we did the harmonies and we we like kind of perfected it and like it was like our song that we were doing we wanted to film it but we just never got around to doing it
B	mm
A	like to put on Youtube or something but it was just it was fun and easy and she suggested to me she's like oh do you want to do some music? I'm like yeah okay it's not like
B	yeah
A	it's not like I can play guitar and you can't so watch me play it's
B	yeah yeah and I hate that like that's why I think that's why me and
A	yeah
B	like
A	did I tell you about me and
B	about what?
A	like how well it's
B	yeah
A	and like for my overall year grade and stuff and she was the same like we were both quite ambitious and driven and stuff but my mum and her parents would always turn everything into a competition like literally it was awful like
B	yeah
A	I was like I tried my hardest and I didn't do as good like so what and then when I got my final results and I got the erm
B	yeah
A	that's not a big deal we got like one point something difference overall
B	yeah
A	and my mum was just like oh yeah look you beat
B	mm
A	I was like stop turning it into that like I'm not even happy at the fact that I did so much better than my friends because they all proper like sort of shunned me because they only just scraped it and stuff
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	she'd always always I brought it up with her actually this summer and I said I hope you realise how like awful that made me feel when you kept doing that
B	yeah
A	and she was just like oh no I
B	or turn it into a competition?
A	yeah and then make you feel shit
B	I fucking hate that too that like me and
B	like I'm making an effort to make an effort with you by talking to you about this and she's like well this is just who I am
B	yeah it's loads better yeah like
A	that's good well if ever something like that happens next year like if I'm there to witness I will I will comment
B	it's just pissed off though
A	why?
B	because this is the impression I got like when I met
A	that's nice
B	me and
B	and erm she were like why didn't you tell
A	yeah
B	she's not interested in lovey-dovey soppy shit like that and she was like oh yeah you have got a point actually she was like
A	which I guess is fair enough
A	yeah
B	and like I didn't feel like I needed to tell her before everyone else I didn't want to
A	no but that's fair enough that's absolutely fair enough you don't have to feel bad about that
B	and erm no not at all and erm
A	I guess see how this year pans out I mean if you guys get closer and shit then why why not
B	yeah it's not
A	mm you could always talk to her about it and be like look I'm debating whether or not to ask you like in the future whether or not to be a bridesmaid
B	mm
A	I'd be like would you like that responsibility or
B	I don't want her to be my bridesmaid though right now at this moment in time I don't want that
A	no no but I mean if ever you do
B	if we ever got really close yeah mm it's only six years down the line yet
B	erm
A	our mums are out here chatting
B	but yeah like yeah
