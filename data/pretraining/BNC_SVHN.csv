A	no I have done that
E	you went out in the storm
A	I have done
A	I went out in a storm erm
B	yeah
E	cos someone needed to go to Sports Direct
A	but he was like he was like come oh yeah that was
C	it's his fault it's your fault
A	it is your fault
B	but she's been doing you've been doing belly dancing instead haven't you?
A	yeah
C	oh have you?
A	yeah no I have been doing running but just not as much as I had planned to
C	how much
A	erm
B	oh just a good cup please
A	yeah when we went to Sports Direct erm
E	whose idea was it?
A	it was my idea
E	it was your idea
B	a little bit off yeah please yeah
A	it was it was my idea to go to Sports Direct
B	yeah it's nicer shorter
A	because it's like like it was ages away the Sports Direct we didn't realise how far it was it was basically in
C	no
A	yeah we got er whatever number bus we got erm into where we were supposed to get off and walk down this long road to Sports Direct but there were
E	it was pre storm
A	pre pre flooding it was like that
B	okay
A	the storm erm so we got we had to get off at the bus stop afterwards which was ages away we walked all the way back and we thought okay that's not too bad we'll just walk down this road in like just go along next to where the roadworks are figured out that the entire road was blocked off and it was like a building site
E	so we trespassed
A	so we were basically
A	trespassing through this building site because we
E	banter
A	couldn't get out we literally couldn't get out at one point either
E	I I had to
A	because the door that like the gate
E	break a lock there
A	that we were supposed to use
E	I broke the lock
A	yeah he had to break the lock
A	for us to get out
A	this was like still we were already absolutely soaked and freezing by this point
E	and you were like oh shall we go back? I'm like no
A	I was like yeah but I was
A	so annoyed I was like it's not worth it but instead
E	well
A	we carried on it took how long did it take us to walk there?
E	thirty
C	and did
E	minutes
A	thirty minutes
C	and did you get what you wanted?
A	yeah I did
E	I made sure she got what she wanted
A	it would have been
B	so by the time you'd paid the bus and a taxi and the bus you probably could have gone to a elite sports shop
A	probably
B	in
A	we don't have any elite sports shops
E	we have the DW
A	we have DW but it's expensive so we was like oh Sports Direct get some cheap stuff
E	yeah worth it for the the journey and the emotional trauma
E	and also the the force of the wind it felt like it was stabbing my face a little bit with the er rain
A	yeah cos your hood only went to like there didn't it whereas mine
E	yes
A	hood came over erm
B	oh can you hear this girl? softy
C	yeah

B	yeah they were
B	really
A	he was royally buggered
E	yes he was
E	I'm am a southerner still
B	they were
B	they're basically cos their their block of flats was basically there was water all round it so they lost all power and because they're in a block of flats they need they have a pump to pump the water
C	yeah
B	so of course that broke so they had no water no lecky and he everything's lecky in his flat so he had nothing so they
B	came home
