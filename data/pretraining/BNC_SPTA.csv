B	ought to test it actually
A	is it working?
B	I'm presuming it's recording
C	so is a format it has to come in or
B	MP3
C	right
A	could you pass me the pepper
B	there you go
B	mm but people just forget it's on anyway and
B	like
A	it looks delicious
C	mm
B	mm how come unhealthy food is cheaper? that's a bit cruel
C	well what by do you mean like a a nice piece of erm fish?
B	yeah expensive
C	it's
B	more expensive than this
C	mm yeah
B	mm pasta's a little bit hard isn't it?
A	no it's delicious
C	lovely
A	uhu
C	what cheese did you use?
B	actually where would the speaker be on this? I mean the
A	the
C	the mic
B	the microphone
A	the Somerset cheddar had been intended for my lunch tomorrow morning
C	oh
A	tomorrow at work
C	you won't have to go hungry now will you?
A	potentially yes
A	it's nice it works very well with the spinach I would
B	yes it does
A	say
C	but this can't be all bad though
B	er
A	it's pretty not
B	quite bad
B	erm carbohydrate fest isn't it really?
C	got your greens
B	mm there's not a lot er in there
A	it's got one of your five a day
B	only just barely
A	onion
B	the onions are good though
C	this is far superior to a macaroni cheese I remember
A	did your mummy used to make it?
C	yeah she did
B	she did I didn't like it then
C	she
B	it took me years to erm like macaroni cheese
C	she actually used macaroni
B	mm
C	which I just always found it very slimy I didn't
B	no macaroni's lovely I usually use macaroni
A	well it was probably how she made the cheese sauce that was the erm issue
B	no it was years before I started making macaroni cheese cos I did have that
A	I mean it but it might have been like a granular cheese sauce add boiling water
B	no
C	it was
B	but I remember not liking macaroni cheese
C	yes it wasn't very tasty I don't think just just very
B	mm
C	slimy I
A	mm
C	to me
B	or something that you don't like when you're younger
C	yeah
A	what?
B	macaroni cheese
A	uhu
C	you see I don't think she added anything like onion or I think it literally was
C	macaroni and cheese sauce wasn't it?
B	yeah mm probably yeah
A	I'd still maintain that she probably didn't do a real French cheese sauce like with a roux
B	well how would she have
C	yeah in fact she she taught me how to make sauces
B	I've got a
A	okay
B	white sauce in my cookery book
C	mm
B	that came from her and
C	mm
B	it's done with the flour and
A	well I I stand corrected
B	butter
C	yeah you melt a bit of butter and then you
B	mm
C	add the
C	yeah and I always remember erm thinking it was a miracle cos when I first started making it it goes all lumpy
B	mm
C	and you you panic and you go oh my god it's just gone all lumpy
B	yes it's all quite chemical isn't it?
C	I think you have to have faith and and
B	mm
C	keep whisking and add the milk and
B	yes
A	she was always surprised when I would do a real gravy
B	yes so what did we do with gravy did she just?
A	which is the same kind of principle isn't it?
B	I remember gravy as being very thin
C	it was only though erm
C	in later years that she started using those packet gravies she used to make it properly
B	yeah
C	proper gravy
B	I remember yeah
C	using the the the
B	they didn't come in till later
C	juice from the meat and the veg water
B	mm
C	and
A	and cooking through a flour in the fat to be the thickening agent
B	I remember loving Sunday roasts
A	mm you still do dear
B	mm
C	mm
A	I think this gains more from the spinach than it loses from not having bacon
B	it does actually yeah you're right but I also think it needs that extra something otherwise it's too much cheese and pasta
A	and spinach
B	no otherwise it's too much cheese and pasta
C	have you put garlic in it?
B	no
A	no
C	I shall have a smidgen
A	what time are we expecting
C	well er the boat's supposed to get in at nine thirty and he's got to drive from Portsmouth
A	that's quite late
B	and so what is?
A	that's very late
B	there's some work being done on the road isn't there again?
A	not our bit
C	it looked alright there was one bollard
B	right
C	further up the road but that was all I mean just
A	they're gonna re-lay the lower half of the road
C	it looks so much smarter doesn't it?
B	mm it does
C	what when we were at home?
B	yeah
C	I don't know I remember there were lots of ones I hated liver and bacon on Mondays I hated
B	I used to like that
A	she loves
B	I think I like
C	no I don't I don't mind it now but something it was always really dry I remember
B	well it was very tough yes
C	it was like
B	mm I remember
C	I don't remember having a favourite I think it was cakes
B	the cakes were good
C	yes we had some good cakes
B	mm walnut cake coffee walnut cake was good
C	mm bachelor's buttons
B	oh
C	used to make those double quantities cos they used to go in about five seconds
B	mm
A	we always my sister and I always used to think that my father was a a brilliant cook but then only in hindsight when we were adults we realised that actually what we had was mini pizzas from the freezer and oven chips
A	but delicious er or he he was famous for his casserole which was was made from that it was made from a tin of Uncle Ben's sauce
C	mm
A	so in hindsight it it seems less spectacular
B	but great at that time
C	that was quite exotic though isn't it pizza? we never had pizza
B	no I remember when pizza was new
A	don't know if they do
B	fairly new
A	those little mini pizzas anymore they were the rage in er
B	yeah the seventies mm
A	the late seventies mid to late seventies
B	yeah frozen
A	you'd get just a pack of twelve just boring cheese and tomato
C	mm
B	mm
A	absolutely nothing on them
B	that was it
B	yeah
A	finish that off
B	I used to think they were great

C	yes yeah
C	yeah it tends to knock
C	knock you out for January doesn't it?
B	yeah completely
B	so do you want to go and watch Hinterland then? we're loving Hinterland
A	oh yes
C	it's it's finished hasn't it?
B	probably but we're watching it on the
C	we're well or
B	player
C	oh you're watching old ones right
A	we're behind
B	mm
A	the er general sequence yeah
C	cos I erm I think I missed the last one but it finished a couple of weeks ago
B	I love the grimness
A	you always chuckle when he gets his torch out
B	he gets his torch out all the time
B	he never puts the light on
C	oh no that would be no fun would it?
B	no
A	they're not currently this series
B	and always visits someone in the dark
A	this series they they're not doing the running joke of him getting
B	he always gets beaten up as well
A	facial injuries
B	he's
A	he is getting beaten up still but
B	yeah
A	accrued
B	through the last episode he more and more kind of like
A	accrued additional injuries
B	and then like additional injuries it was
C	there's something about the the the the the woman er detective she's always wearing her red parka there's something about that
B	yeah
C	isn't there?
B	the red coat all the time
C	yeah
B	just
C	is it from like
B	it's funny
C	erm Don't Look Now the film you know?
B	so maybe symbolism or something
C	yeah we don't
C	the the dwarf
B	yeah
C	walking round in the red
A	or it could be Nabokovian ah
B	well I love their filters you know the cinematographic filters
A	it's a beautiful
B	yeah it's all very
A	what is it where where is it sort of
B	the grim
A	do you know what part of
C	it's it's from Swansea I think
A	is it?
B	it's absolutely gorgeous
C	yeah
A	it's absolutely stunning
C	yeah
B	it makes me want to go there cos where was that house that we saw that had that amazing view of the sea? erm
A	in
B	inside the house that must have been Swansea I suppose
A	you mean in Hinterland?
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	on the you know
C	but it looks really bleak
B	oh I wanna go there
C	and cold
B	oh I love that
A	oh that's what I like about it
B	oh and
A	actually we're watching it out of sequence so it's also a bit strange cos the last one we saw was just a normal thing but then the episode before that ended with him being burnt out of his holiday whatever you call it caravan
B	I think that was last I don't know anyway
A	no cos we we watched it out of sequence
B	we are watching it out of sequence
C	mm
A	oh gosh I hope that wasn't the end of the series we may have watched them all
B	it might be they're very
C	it did it did end very suddenly
A	did it end with his house burning down?
C	well I didn't I I think I must have not seen that one because I had been away and I said to
B	oh
C	so maybe that was
B	it's erm it's very expensive the films cos it's really beautifully er crafted and
C	mm
B	er it makes me laugh though cos it's got everybody always erm people don't really do this in real life but they were erm
B	stare at each other after they've said something
C	yeah
B	you know
A	there's a lot of that
A	yeah
A	in his slightly too
B	it's like if that happened in real life it would be really embarrassing it's like mm what? what?
C	yeah
A	his slightly too
B	what are you looking at?
A	close fitting trousers and jacket
C	yeah and
B	oh yeah
A	furrowed brow
B	everyone has a
C	but you the when audio describing something like that it's it becomes so hard because there's only so many times you can say furrowed brow and you know
B	yeah
C	their eyes lock
B	the lingering stare is so funny
A	a pregnant pause
C	and it's kind of like
B	yeah
C	oh got to think of something else to say
B	yeah
C	and they're doing it all the time
B	yeah
C	but er
B	it is a bit funny but the torch is especially makes me laugh there he is he's got his touch out again
C	he gets out his torch
A	thing is when he gets it out he never tries to see if the light
A	work
C	so you watch it all on Iplayer?
B	yeah
C	cos you don't
A	the other one we always enjoyed was what was it? terrible name crime stories back case
B	oh
A	Case History
B	that wasn't very good really
A	I always liked that
B	mm
A	and I thought the lead in that was terrific he I've never seen him in anything else ever
B	he probably is
A	he's a terrific lead
B	I can't remember his name
A	but it it was the same series
C	mm
B	yeah similar
A	where where I mean in terms of the characterisation
B	he was always out jogging
A	he was always out jogging and then
B	mm
A	doing pregnant
B	oh that was that was more light-hearted though that wasn't nearly as sort of
A	oh it had much more of
B	dark
A	a of a comedic
B	kind of yeah
A	element when when in
B	it wasn't
A	into his interaction with various other characters
B	this is the bleakest one I've ever come across really for bleakness and even even bleaker than Vera which is set up north and it's
C	what about all the erm the Nordic ones? were you watching any of those?
B	yeah cos this is very based on those I think
A	yes yeah so there a real fashion for those now
B	and they they they must have started the whole
A	you I also think part of the reason why it's bilingual is specifically to appeal to in terms of marketing it
B	well it's very trendy isn't it?
C	mm
A	in the Nordic countries
B	yeah well no I don't know why they just don't have the whole thing in Welsh and have subtitles
A	they do they they they've they've done more series
B	but they don't have subtitles
A	oh no no but I mean
B	yeah
A	they they have done for for erm Welsh TV
B	but why not have subtitles? cos it's really trendy at the moment to have subtitles
C	yeah yeah
A	but he doesn't speak Welsh
B	I mean I'd watch it
A	or is that does his character doesn't speak Welsh?
B	no he doesn't erm no he must do in the other ones though
C	so in the Welsh version
A	that's a good point
B	the Welsh ones yeah
C	unless he speaks English and they have Welsh subtitles for when he
A	so there you go maybe so
B	oh I don't know
A	cos it's er really for Welsh speakers
B	but why not just have more Welsh things with the subtitles?
C	mm
B	it makes sense
C	but it must be really weird for the actors cos they have to do everything twice once in Welsh and once in English
B	but they're not the same ones though are they?
A	yeah
B	are they?
C	I think so yeah oh there's been
A	I think there's been additional series that have never been shown on on BBC which
B	I thought that
A	er on BBC England
B	it probably started out as Welsh
A	which are entirely in Welsh
B	and then
C	so are you watching it on BBC London then?
A	no we're watching it on
B	Iplayer
C	Wales? BBC Wales?
A	the
B	no just the Iplayer it's on BBC4
C	cos it's really weird
A	BBC4 so the BBC Wales one I think maybe was
B	is Welsh
A	and there've been additional series which haven't been shown
B	it is Welsh? cos I looked it up
A	yeah there you go
B	and it's called
A	mm good ish
B	or something
C	yes
C	phonetically
A	that's the same name as my mother-in-law's former husband
A	so now you have to anonymise it do you see what I did then darling?
B	ah I see name
A	proper noun
A	I'm gonna go and test that key
B	yeah
A	oh well let me have you found it?
C	no I'm going to go and look for it and I'm going to test it
A	well hang on I'll
C	uhu I I've found a key
A	that's it
A	er
A	well that's the that's the only key so
C	well let me go and give it a try
A	yeah
B	I'll just follow you with the thing
C	do you
A	yeah
A	only if there's no one in but sometimes
C	right
A	that light looks beautiful
B	mm
C	well that one works
B	I'm finishing all the sweets
A	what sweets are you eating now? the oh darling today
A	and everything and then I looked the person sat next to me was eating a multipack of those they're called Reese or something they're American peanut cookies
B	oh shit
A	so I had to get up and
B	and you felt it on your head?
A	I just felt like all my nerve endings
B	on there
A	just not quite right
B	so sensitive
A	and my lips yeah I am quite sensitive
B	mm it's good
A	so I had to get up and walk away
C	what happened?
A	just the girl next to me at work we sit really shoulder to shoulder started eating they're called I think they're called Reese I I've seen them before
C	oh yes
A	they're like a bright orange packaging
C	yeah
A	and they're
C	they're American aren't they?
A	yeah they're an American peanut cookie or
C	yes
A	and there's er just sat there going like
B	that's the
A	there she is tucking in and then I start to get sort of you know tingly
C	oh legally don't you have to have a certain amount of space? I mean you shouldn't have to be
A	I think legally we have enough space but what they've been doing over the years
B	they just do the
A	and the company has expanded erm there's been a erm a sort of requisite
B	of course
C	so you have to be
A	across individual desks
C	quite quite slim to get a job
A	and also the the spaces between the aisles
B	oh it's disgusting
A	is as well I don't I mean I don't mind it it's not
B	oh I hate it
A	as long as people aren't eating
B	no I hate it
A	peanutty things I don't I don't really mind it
B	yeah but people eat fruit people eating bananas oh I can't bear it you know? and they're it's like there and they start eating fruit and bananas and it's like oh
A	but I mean I'm happy to tell something if I think what they're doing is antisocial I didn't tell the girl eating peanuts
C	mm
A	cos it
B	but even just eating at the desk's
A	erm
B	a bit gross when other people are there
C	yeah I mean
B	mm
C	but to have somebody
B	I mean cos that's what I can't bare about bare about it that's why I can't do it it's it's erm no
C	how's how's your ear now? are you still doing the eardrops?
A	it seems okay now
B	has it cleared?
A	well I've not had the same kind of issues yeah
B	it's unblocked itself then has it?
A	well it's no longer blocked whether it will become re-blocked in the next sort of
C	was it wax that was blocking it?
B	yeah
C	mm you didn't have to have it syringed then or?
A	no
B	that's good
C	hoovered out
A	no
B	but
A	well I went yeah had had I been to the nurse before we had that conversation?
C	you said you were putting the drops in
A	no I think that was just what I I'd bought yeah sorry
C	mm
A	whatever the
C	bicarbonate and olive oil? I've never heard
A	just cos bicarbonate of soda
B	I've never heard of that one
A	no I've heard of olive oil but not bicarbonate of soda it would go all fizzy wouldn't it?
A	well yeah she she cos all she wrote on the little is a little erm
B	weird
A	okay so the powder
C	that's you use in cooking yeah

C	and so did it fizz? cos I've used one of those and
A	it didn't

C	he's doing very well on it though
B	very well
C	don't seem to be letting it hold you back
B	mm
A	keep telling
A	which is true because in the old days when I worked with a couple of my favourite colleagues we'd be out every night well
B	yes
A	not literally every night but
B	you were actually
A	but maybe three out of five
B	and quite
A	weekdays
B	quite intense ones as well
C	it's also so expensive now
A	but even
B	yeah
A	well that's that's er
B	well
A	er
A	that was also an issue
B	it's not even a possibility really now
A	but I mean even a a light evening out would would be we'd each buy a round that's three pints before you get home then I'd have maybe you know a can of beer whereas now I just come home
B	yes you're home very early now
A	one or two cans
B	yes
A	in bed by
B	nine
A	half eight sometimes playing Scrabble

C	oh how is she?
B	well
A	she's studying
C	is she still with her millionaire isn't she with a millionaire or something?
A	she's studying and when she's not studying she's abroad somewhere and it it could be
C	with her millionaire?
A	yeah that they just basically
B	he's not a millionaire
A	he probably is
B	he doesn't
C	in terms of assets
B	he's just
A	anyway he's wealthy and they're all all over the place
C	what's she studying?
B	art history I think
C	oh how lovely and she's a photographer what a lovely life and she's going out with a millionaire just
B	yeah but
A	but I mean I mean
B	she's not very happy for it
C	she's Russian isn't she?
A	yeah she often isn't
A	but last erm last year they were in California doing a wine sort of trek around certain wineries er New Year cos she does not want to be in London
A	they were in Venice or Vienna
B	oh she's very
A	and she was in Spain
B	at the moment as well it's disgraceful and I need it now
B	I need it what? three months?
B	what? mm
C	so
A	he still works with me yeah he's doing well he's just been told cos he's quite vain isn't he?
B	he yes
A	and er
B	he's been told what?
A	I mean he deserves to be vain cos he's a good looking chap but he's been he went to get his eyes tested and he's been told he needs spectacles
A	so he's in a bit of a a
C	he's got to get designer frames has he? and
A	maybe that and and thing is they're so expensive designer and the frame
B	is that why you were saying you you can?
A	yeah so I said well I I have a couple of pairs cos I have lots of pairs that I don't
B	but they won't be the right
A	wear no no he'd have to pop out the lens and get his own lenses but he'd have the designer frames which on their own would be yeah
B	yeah
A	a couple of hundred quid
B	I think it could look really good on him though
A	but er just after Christmas we had a big clear out and
B	there's still one downstairs
A	all the no no they turned out to be that's what I told
B	sunglasses
A	so he said he was really excited and they turned out to be
B	oh damn it
A	great big red
A	sunglasses which wasn't at all what he was after
C	no
B	yes
C	and when
C	cleaned everything didn't he? he erm
A	mm yes
C	he even cleaned the slats in the like it was a cupboard with slatted things and he
A	yeah
C	cleaned each one
A	and the tiles that did not last
B	it didn't last
A	the two German girls gone in and did a sort of deep clean
A	right
B	we've got to get
A	I might turn up in
B	okay yes
A	we could watch Hinterland
A	then you could supervise as I gently drift off peacefully
B	then I might get up again and do some work
A	could do
B	mm
A	do it quietly but what if
B	er I will I will slither out
A	have you chosen what book you'd like?
B	no I'm thinking what shall I get?
A	yeah there you go
B	is it any book?
A	I've got a voucher that will buy any Kindle book so yes
B	any any any
A	self-help
B	yes another self-help book I think
A	mm probably I didn't think you were going to say
B	oh what about one about another one about the menopause?
A	Tristram Shandy
A	Tristram Shandy
B	is that a writer is it?
A	it's a novel
C	I can't remember who wrote that
B	I'm loving my Kindle at the moment
A	Laurence Sterne
B	oh
C	what sort of Kindle have you got?
B	got the old one I want the white one the one with white
C	what the one the one with the buttons you press?
B	er
A	it's the
B	no
A	version after that but annoyingly I bought it
C	they brought the touch one with the
A	the latest erm you know bells and whistles
C	mm
A	one
B	but I if I I differentiate between erm
A	it is is it touchscreen? I think it is
B	yeah I differentiate between the tablet ones and the the ones that are exclusively readers because the readers are like books and they read as
C	yeah
B	they've got a page look and everything
A	yeah but no but the then they
B	so I don't really even compare them
A	brought out the the paper white whatever it's called
B	oh the paper white that's the one I want
A	and it's back lit
C	cos
A	that's a tablet which is
B	that's a tablet
A	one that we were looking at buying
B	I don't even consider that a reader
A	as buying as a tablet
C	mm
A	not as
B	no
A	not as
B	yeah
A	a reader
B	but the e-
B	light and the white
C	yeah
B	paper but they probably did that on purpose didn't they? cos maybe they could have done that first but I've got the grey page and I've always thought that's a bit grey can't I
C	mm
B	turn it up a bit?
C	yeah
A	none of them used to do it until quite well quite recently in the last sort of
B	bet they had the technology
A	three or four years cos I remember having a conversation with erm
C	yes
B	yeah
A	without a light on
B	yes
A	whilst
C	yeah
A	her husband
B	exactly
A	kipped
C	yeah
A	and of course with all the readers you needed a light
C	yeah
A	er
B	and then now
A	and so I researched and and I found a couple of things that
B	you'd have thought
A	cos now
B	they could have done that firstly
A	now they're all backlit and you can read them
C	mm
B	that's just so that you have to buy another one I'm sure
C	well no
A	well no they
C	mine's an antique now
B	is it?
A	they
B	I think they would have had the technology
A	I mean that no one ever thought of applying it they had the technology
C	you
A	yeah cos they had
C	but
A	all kinds of er
C	yes you could have a sort of light you could clipped on the top
B	I've seen those
A	they had all extras like that yeah
C	yeah
B	I don't think it's worth me getting a clip-on light because I'll end up getting erm the Kindle white one probably Christmas or something
A	well it doesn't it doesn't and it doesn't keep me up anyway does it so?
B	it doesn't actually but I'd like to read in the dark I think
A	and er
B	that would be nice
A	ah oh I worry about your eyes though cos you do a lot
C	they're supposed to be kind
B	it doesn't glare like a
C	yeah like a computer yeah
B	computer it doesn't feel the same way at all but I don't know it's obviously not a page page but it's a beautiful thing to I mean even the old one I've got it's very beautifully clear and I love the way you can just make the writing whatever size you want to and everything
C	yes but then you've
C	thing is I've got to the stage now
B	yeah okay
C	I end up getting about three words per page
C	so it's not
B	it's gets worrying
A	I can't do
B	yeah
A	without my proper book though
B	we've got to the stage where we need a magnifying glass now we definitely need to buy a magnifying glass cos there are some little things
A	we looked at them in the shop didn't we darling?
B	yeah we are gonna get one
C	you can get some beautiful desk ones I want one of those ones you put on and it's got it's like on a stand with an arm and extendable arm?
B	oh that sounds nice
C	so you can just hold it over your
B	yeah
C	they're beautiful some of them
A	ah
A	it is
B	no it's not it's just
A	they're super excited
C	yeah no no er
C	this is not from this is not from
B	ah
B	what is that his er pocket money?
C	well his living money his er cos he he lives in he doesn't live at home anymore he lives in
B	of course it would be living money wouldn't it?
A	does
C	well not we don't know
A	and it'll probably be like that for a while then won't it? you not knowing now
C	yeah
A	cos you're so English because you are English?
C	yes cos our French is so bad
A	yeah
B	yes that's the answer was yes
C	an underfloor heating
B	yes
C	oh right oh did you get my email?
B	yeah I did yeah
C	oh right I wasn't sure cos I was didn't it come through
B	yeah that's fine I'll be here well just let me know when what when it's on the way or whatever
C	yeah I don't think he's ordered it yet so
B	yeah
C	mm
A	well I might turn in that darling is that alright? you come up
B	yeah
A	just to watch Hinterland at least?
B	I will come up to watch Hinterland we've done another forty-five minutes so that's quite good really so that's eighteen pounds plus forty-five minutes that's nearly
B	two hours' worth so
A	are you allowed to discuss the financial
B	I don't see why not it's all words isn't it?
A	it seems to somehow demean it though
B	it's what it's all about
A	uhu
B	it's about money
C	do they have to have erm a big variety of people talking though?
B	yes
C	so you can't have it you
B	they've got to cover the whole country
A	that's my worry when I said is there a political bias on the basis that if it's just sort of twenty somethings
B	no it's everybody
A	and and often student-based
B	no no no no it's all age groups
A	that you're gonna get a very quite a specific
C	yeah
A	erm demographic
C	most people are left wing though
A	well not according to the
B	all of them across the board I've only done one
A	not according to election results my dear
B	exactly but maybe that's means that people don't admit to it
C	no exactly I think that's that's more the point
B	it's because it's erm
C	people don't people
B	it's morally more right to be left wing so that's how people will talk but when it comes to electing
A	you become more selfish
B	yeah
C	yes
B	ultimately
A	yeah yeah
B	it must be
C	right
B	it must be something to be ashamed of then to be right wing
C	but I suppose right wing politics you wouldn't kind of go
B	cos it's very mean sounding ring wing
C	exactly isn't it? I mean it's alright
B	so you don't want to sound like
C	to say something left wing like I think we should all look after
B	we should share
C	every member of society
C	whereas if you say no I I I earned worked very hard to earn my money and I'm not giving it to anybody
B	exactly this is the difference and you're not gonna say that cos it's kind of impolite even so
C	right I'm gonna go and think of an answer to this text
B	okay
C	oh
A	how do you send in him your money? do you just do they just
C	I do a bank transfer
A	ah it's not like a brown paper envelope?
A	with
C	no
B	coming
A	mm I I put him right in front of it
C	I think I think we might have forgotten to bring towels I don't know if if
B	okay
A	ah that could be a problem cos
B	luckily we've just washed some
A	we may not have any clean ones
B	yeah we do
C	well
B	I washed some
C	if you've just have you got one spare? cos I
B	they're still a tiny bit damp but we've got some
A	then why are they in a cupboard then
B	because I needed to make room for the sheets
A	is
B	can you manage with one or do you want two?
C	oh just just give us what's there thank you
A	is
B	well what do you mean am I sure?

B	well there there's a symbol for a pause so
C	but is it?
B	a symbol for a short pause and a symbol for a long one if it's over five seconds it's a symbol for the long one
C	oh okay
B	so
C	so you have to time it?

A	negates the full
B	yes okay I'm going to stop now
