B	well you know what you've got to do now in a couple of minutes say oh that one there's
F	no please don't do that
B	watch her go into a state of decline
F	I'm never OCD about anything but I think I am with this the most
D	I'll come I'll come over here I can get a better idea then
F	I think I'm OCD with this the most cos I always want it to look good
B	well you've done two already haven't you?
F	yeah I know
B	although in fairness you were getting help
F	no he just he just stands there and tries to annoy me
B	exactly
F	I'm used to it it's fine
B	that's why I put the help in inverted commas
A	yeah I know
B	there
E	see?
B	oh no not there
F	shut up
F	that
E	absolutely spiffing that is
F	I know
B	oh oh

F	oh that's a nice one
B	stick it up your T-shirt
E	it is a nice one isn't it?
D	yeah
F	I like that star
D	yeah
B	ours has gone walkabout
F	have you actually not found it?
B	no
F	can I put one here please?
B	you've got a whole pigging tree and you want the bit right by my belly
F	well yeah cos it's even
F	there's
B	pigging I wonder if they'll er
E	what? as
B	annotate that
E	as in
F	pigging
E	as in crisp and even?
B	oh no you've got me at it now
F	what?
B	I went to hang one and then I thought oh no it's too close that to that one I can't
A	well yeah you've gotta make it look good haven't you?
E	have you? oh
F	yeah oh I
B	perhaps it's the randomness that makes it look good
B	well I think all the little ones at the top oh no I've got a big bald patch
F	cool fine
B	that can't go there
F	what? what?
F	what are you doing?
B	I'm moving yours cos they're in the way
F	well you'd better put it in a nice place not some
B	there
F	no that's not a nice place see I had that in a perfect place no it's too close to the other ones you need to do it so that it's spaced out evenly then you do more so that there's still so it's like proportionally spaced out
D	proportionally? good heavens
B	note to the
F	but you see what I mean don't you?
B	note to the person who's transcribing I've got a sarcastic look on my face
B	and the answer is no not until
E	our verdict
B	March
E	if your flat screen TV is at least eight years old you are most likely missing out on full HD much improved sound and a crystal clear picture you'll have a much better TV viewing experience if you upgrade
F	I don't think she cares
E	there you go
B	is it in brackets but not until it's your proper birthday you're not having another present too early?
E	only upgrade if you really want a smart TV otherwise we would suggest waiting until four K models come down in price and more content is available for them
B	there you are then might as well wait
E	I'll wait till March
D	wait for what?
B	sixtieth birthday
E	I'll wait till March then
D	what what advantage have they got then? what is this four K?
E	the four K is the new ultra ultra
D	yeah
E	they're much more pixels and much clearer picture
D	oh what about the sound
E	and it's like
D	side of it?
E	of the what sorry?
D	sound
E	sound?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	what's that?
D	that's er that's the problem that we have
E	well they reckon the sound so the latest TVs the sound is better than a few
D	mm
E	but
B	we haven't
F	no that's what I was thinking
B	you keep going with silver and I'll
F	alright
E	well they don't say a lot about the sound to be honest with you
D	no
E	it's better than obviously the sound on ours but they're
D	no no
E	they are improving it gradually even if it's a small telly I think it's they're sort of
A	oh
E	general trend on here
D	you can see eventually they'll
E	yeah
D	so that you get better sound
E	yeah
D	so we've done full circle then
E	yeah
D	are these all tied together?
E	oh no
B	no
D	well I wouldn't dare put one on because it would upset
F	hey don't
F	put it on there
B	oh that's pretty
F	yes it is pretty at least you er realised it though
B	thank you I need red sort of round there somewhere
F	yeah
F	you mean the one?
unknown_female	oh no that was that one
unknown_female	oh no no
F	that was one that you originally
B	that's a perfect place for that one
F	oh
B	what have you done?
F	I just broke it I think
D	you twanged out no it's not broken
F	no I think it is cos it's the
E	yeah it is
D	it's not broken
F	oh my god
E	not broken so it won't be how it goes on
unknown_female	okay?
E	there you are
F	thank you
E	don't be so violent in future
B	extreme tree decorating
D	what? standing back the other side of the room and throwing them at it you mean?
B	yeah
F	Bear Grylls
F	how far round should we go?
D	well so that people coming along the back there to the back door can see
F	oh so we need to be more erm
D	a little bit of decoration
F	put a red one round here then
B	er er excuse me I'm on red duty you just do pigging silver
B	do your own colour scheme
F	you're not doing a very good job are you? I'm just saying
F	yeah there's like nothing on the back so we need to put some more on the back
B	you go and stand outside in the cold and the rain
F	no thanks
B	and then you can direct me
F	no thanks
D	left a bit right a bit
F	I'd rather not do that
unknown_female	oh yeah
B	I really er really am really not doing it

unknown_female	I'll
unknown_female	you can use up
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I'll use it tomorrow
E	what does extrapolated mean?
D	it means
F	I know
D	getting er getting a result from having witnessed other similar proceedings or things in the first place
B	oh that's not what I was gonna say
D	yeah extrapolation is is using the data you've got to get other data
B	well
E	oh right
B	is like taking and teasing out information extrapolate data
F	yeah take something out yeah
B	we've got a different definition to you dad
D	yes?
B	we thought it was like if you extrapolate data you sort of take a like a mass of data and you
D	oh you erm tease out the bits you need for the purpose that you're that you're looking at it erm
B	yeah okay
D	because we
B	yeah that's what I
D	and then we erm from that we could say well we want something to represent between the hours of twelve and one erm so we'd look at a different data
B	yeah
D	blank does that make sense? or is that a bit?
B	yeah well
B	you can have one of my red ones
F	well give me never mind
B	I don't like his lights I don't like the way the wires show
D	well I think they er they make a make a feature of them now don't they? of of the cables I mean
B	well I don't like it
D	no I would rather it was
B	stop it
D	I'd like to see the lights but not the cables
B	yeah
D	but there you go
E	that's the way er it goes
G	I'm sort of thinking well I'd rather get
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	so what I've got is is in the freezer so I can sort of virtually make a decision on
unknown_female	no well that's it it's
unknown_female	yeah
B	we've got lots of gaps on the back haven't we?
F	that's that's what I was saying
B	yeah but at the same time you
F	yeah fair dos
B	fairs
B	three more
F	and are these all gonna have the the things? ow
E	here's a good
B	are we allowed to
F	yeah fine
B	that's a bit bare there
E	it talks about this TV it says it's a good but that said should you have the budget and space to accommodate the larger set it's probably wiser to opt for the fifteen Sony KDL five 0 W eight two nine which is equipped with blur busting motion interpolation technology
D	there we go
D	well that should be good then
E	yeah
D	blur busting?
E	whatever that whatever that means
D	blur busting?
E	blur busting motion interpolation technology
B	ah pretty
E	there you go
D	haven't got a clue what that means
E	sounds good to me
D	mm oh
F	you need to put the erm
D	by Jove it's come back
E	right
B	yeah just done that do you want the lametta on? I don't like lametta
F	then why were you?
D	I like I like a little bit of lametta
B	a little bit? there you go dad?
F	no I like it I think it's cool
D	you can you can go mad and the whole tree gets
B	yeah
D	gets erm
E	oh yeah don't put too much on
D	overloaded with lametta and you can't see anything but blooming lametta
B	I think
F	it I thought you just have to just sort of chuck it on so it can be like natural
F	it doesn't look good
B	well you've you've chucked creatively
F	no you can't
F	preferably
B	if you
F	preferably
E	be a big
F	don't make the noise
E	be a big crash in a minute and you'll end up in the middle of the tree
F	don't no don't do like clumps of it
F	get off me
B	just dangle it on people actually it works really well
F	it's your own fault
E	that's made a mess
B	er for the purpose of the recording she's just assaulted me
F	no I haven't
B	well we can fill up the back with lametta look
F	yeah
B	er it's alright if you just dangle tiny bits of it it's not too
D	make it sound like there's a bit hole round the back
D	yeah but like I was saying the door you get some people coming along to the back door don't you?
B	yeah okay
F	it looks alright just put some round here can I have some?
F	cheers for the one
B	oh no I don't like that one there that looks messy
unknown_female	and
F	can I have some more? ta

F	I don't want more just a bit
B	come on then dad what do you think from a distance?
D	do what?
D	looking very nice
B	actually I think I've got the knack of it now look you just do little bits at a time I think
D	yeah
F	that's what I said
D	yeah
D	yeah you try and try and do sort of individual bits you get a better effect
F	you're dropping loads
D	could do with a bit down that area there
B	yeah?
D	probably get wiped off when people go through but
F	yeah
D	I think really that's probably enough now otherwise you start to lose the tree then
B	yeah just has to add some more
F	yeah well
B	no I've got the knack now I'm into it now no that's
B	do you want to do the last bit?

D	oh yeah
B	rosé?

A	well rosé
D	cos the red wine was too heavy
A	I like er I like red wine but one glass is enough
D	mm
F	no I'll have a wine I'll be sophisticated and then I'll be

unknown_female	in some ways
A	did you manage alright when all the electric and water was off? did you have food and drink and?
F	yeah well we had we had water anyway and because we had gas erm cookers we were fine
A	mm yeah
F	just needed the light to see what we were doing and and
D	mm
F	erm
D	mm
F	and we had candles and stuff so we were fine
D	so it didn't bother you that much really then?
F	well apart from having like no light in the evening and no electricity or anything
D	what about heating?
F	no we didn't have heating but erm
F	we had water we had cold water but
A	yeah
F	hot water
A	because
D	no well they
F	no cos theirs was
D	that
F	theirs they
A	mm
F	get their water differently I can't remember
D	theirs theirs
D	has to be pumped up
F	yeah yeah pumped like erm ours isn't like
D	you can't just turn a turn a tap and it'll run out
F	mm
D	where where they are because it's very height dependent
F	yeah
A	yeah so it weren't too too bad for you?
F	no I quite enjoyed it it was a change to be honest and we had enough food so we were fine
A	mm
D	good
F	I mean there was erm there was a shop that's round the corner from us anyway erm and on one of the days when the electricity was still out they opened it was open
D	mm
F	and they just let one person in at a time to get stuff because they didn't have fridge stuff anyway it's just like a corner shop
F	so we just went to get a couple of things from there anyway so we were fine
A	why did they only let one person in at a time?
D	safety I should think
F	because yeah safety and they don't have an electricity and they can't do
D	and you can't see to get around anything
A	oh I see
F	and they don't have the cash registers or anything so they don't
D	no
F	they wanna make sure that they do it one person like choose somebody
A	yeah
F	so that they can check that they're
A	yeah well you can't blame them can you?
F	no no no I'm not blaming them
D	no not at all not at all
F	I'm just saying
A	I mean the thing is you hear about some of these houses that have been flooded out and people have moved out and the thieves are moving in and taking anything they can find
D	oh yeah mm
A	and
F	yeah well there was erm there was somebody that posted on a Facebook group for
E	is he still there?
F	well we went to put it inside when we went to
E	oh you went back did you?
F	cos it was the day before we got the train erm that I saw the post so I said when we go to
D	mm
F	get stolen
A	yeah
F	it's unlikely that it would've got stolen anyway it's it's in the backyard and you can't see it but just to be safe
E	mm
A	well yeah but I mean er er isn't it awful? that people get you know hundred and hundreds of people are supporting the victims and trying to raise money and
F	yeah
A	Christmas presents for the kids and things like this and yet you get the thieves that go along the
F	yeah
A	road just thieving
F	yeah
A	taking what they can and there can't be much that hasn't been ruined unless they go upstairs and take stuff and
F	yeah
D	well they'll just get in for easy pickings won't they?
A	get whatever they can get
D	they'll just
A	yeah
D	get whatever they can
B	mm
G	with each other and all the rest of it and that's what this programme gives you a complete list of them all so you can decide how much you wanted to
B	yeah
G	communicate with other things or so it's it's not perfect but it's it certainly seems to be fairly
B	yeah
G	solid

A	she really is a character
F	mm
A	erm she was saying that the er they've moved out there well they're still trying to get the house straight erm and they they put the electricity off for twenty-two hours to save money in the village you know the mayor does it I think she said it was the mayor that switches it off
D	the mayor yeah
A	to save money
D	yeah
F	yeah
A	so you might get up and there's no electricity and they do the same with water every now and then they clean all the pipes out

unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and then with whatever money I have I'll do as much as I can with that money
