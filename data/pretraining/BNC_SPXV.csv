A	do some chopping chop chop chop how was your sister?
B	good just just an annoying ten year old
B	but really good it was really nice to see her actually
A	is she enjoying Turkey?
B	yeah she seems to be it seems as though she's started calling this other guy dad which is a bit weird
A	really?
B	yeah and that doesn't really come from I wouldn't imagine that to come from her because she knows she's got a dad so
A	yeah she obviously yeah of course she has your dad
B	and
A	mm
B	but it's obviously really upsetting my dad
A	aw
B	so
A	I guess it's good that she gets on well with him but yeah you don't
B	it is no it is really good but he's not her dad and I don't think that should be encouraged at all

A	the mum yeah not your sister well your sister
B	it's weird as well but in a nice way
A	still can't believe she just took her to Turkey

B	mm
A	it'd be like over a year now wouldn't it?
B	yeah she went I think June last year
A	yeah but to be fair at least it's not too far away
B	no

A	yeah Turkey was nice but I wouldn't want to live there
B	no oh I've got a cucumber in my bag and that's upstairs
A	oh no
B	it's really hard
A	yeah I know but also cos I'm now here on Friday night and I'm eating out Saturday night and possibly eating out Sunday night it doesn't make any sense to buy food

B	she'll make it for you again
A	I know that's the risk
B	where's the lid?
B	okay
A	like the other day we were talking to this
A	I was like oh good god and then it came to the end of lunch and I'm like yeah it's been nice talking to you and then I turned to
B	yeah
A	like it's not what English people do English people stuck like stick it out until the bitter end English people never say
B	oh you know this is is boring
A	no
B	if you're English you have to endure a lot
A	yeah food you don't like TV shows you don't like conversations you don't like
B	a lot
A	everything you don't like we have to endure because we're English and think we're being polite
B	exactly
A	it's so ridiculous like
B	mm
A	cos you know how English people are like I'm really sorry to be inconvenience you I really appreciate if you do this for me and I understand that it's a really big task but I really appreciate it thank you so much
B	oops
A	so our boss has told her that she has to be nicer
B	more polite to people
A	yeah
B	ah
A	mm
B	we are quite strange if you think about it

B	yeah
A	oh going to sneeze er erm I emailed her again like have you got an update for this
B	no
A	no we
B	I think you should ring her
A	she is literally the shittiest estate agent person I have ever met in my entire life
B	she's really shit
A	I think she just hates me
B	I think she's just not very good that's the best thing though that that you can do in a sort of bad situation is to sort it out
A	yeah exactly
B	cos if it drags on it makes you look worse
A	exactly yeah all I want to do is be like yes of course you can have fifteen pound off your rent or some shit like that
B	yeah
A	but no
B	no she makes life a lot difficult I I
A	mm no but in all my emails I'm really nice to her I put like a smiley face I'm like hi how are you? and she just completely just she's just like fuck off
B	bitch
A	mm I'm not really impressed with her customer attitude
B	I'm not really impressed with her either
A	no it's just a bit like you should be erm you know? I'm your customer we pay eight hundred pounds a month to live in this house and you can't even be bothered to return a phone call
B	I just don't think they're a very good
A	no the trays are on there
B	yeah
A	did you squirt yourself?
B	yes
A	yeah yeah well we couldn't have really chosen any differently could we? well we could but I think we both just got to the end and we were like fuck trying to find another place
B	we could have but yeah I couldn't be bothered
A	no
B	this is actually quite a good here anyway I think it's pretty
A	mm yeah
B	oh dear this is in the sink
A	oh no
B	what am I going to do?
A	different
B	oh god ruining everything
A	have to say first world problems
B	yeah it is
B	erm oh yeah
A	so what else do you put in there? yoghurt oats
B	almond milk
A	almond milk
B	chia seeds and that's it
A	fruit same as I do but put coconut in it and seeds
B	mm I quite like almond milk as well
A	even don't ever ever have it tea
B	I had it in coffee it's not so bad
A	oh in tea it's grim as fuck
B	I can imagine it is tea doesn't really want to be nutty does it?
A	no I remember once I was trying to be like healthy and tried erm nut milk and I had it with English breakfast and it was just literally an assault
B	that's a mistake that is a mistake
A	an assault on my mouth
B	but it's quite nice with coffee
A	where do you get all those chia seeds from?
B	they've they've got a new health shop in erm
A	really?
B	so
A	are they expensive?
B	quite they were on for something like three quid
A	that's not bad
B	not bad really
A	chia seeds are normally quite expensive
B	yeah I think they were like half price
A	yeah I had loads and now I've run out and so
B	hands off
A	no I haven't been eating them recently
B	they've got a lot of antioxidants in them
A	yeah it's so funny I had this debate with someone the other week they're having they had like a handful of blueberries and I kid you not it was like six blueberries
B	yeah
A	and they were like yeah but they're full of antioxidants and I was like do you know the amount of blueberries you have to eat
B	you need a bucket full
A	yeah to get the amount of antioxidants you think you're getting? you'd actually have to eat thousands of them
B	about a thousand million of them
A	yeah and they were like no you don't it's one punnet like no no no one punnet
B	is nothing
A	it's you'll get some yeah you will get some you know good vitamins and shit out of it but you're going to get all the antioxidants in the world like no
B	you probably think you're getting it
A	yeah
B	oh I forgot to put some honey in it
A	yeah you always need a bit of honey although I want I you getting the right balance of honey is really difficult
B	it is really difficult
A	I put too much in once it was a bit grim it was like er
B	really?
A	it was too sweet
B	that's I I I got it perfect the other day
A	I always put in one teaspoon or something well not one
B	yeah I haven't been able to match it since
A	it's all it's all about trial and error isn't it really?
B	yeah
A	it is good stuff though
B	two teaspoons?
A	yeah two maybe yeah two
B	we'll do another half
A	two and a half why not?
B	why not?
A	it's not going to kill you
B	just for the
A	shits and gigs
B	I'll eat
A	there's this one woman at work she's a bit of a health freak and she turned round she goes I don't really eat sugar I only eat honey I was like
B	oh ho
A	I was like what do you think honey is? you know what I mean it's a bit like did you actually just hear what you just said to me? and she's like use like alaga syrup and all this stuff in her cooking she like goes a bit extreme with it and it's like you might not have like refined sugar but you're still eating pure sugar
B	honey is sugar
A	yeah
B	that's the most sugar you're going to get
A	it is literally a spoonful of sugar just in runny form
B	I love honey
A	me too honey is great honey on
B	really?
A	like years in fact but it's so nice
B	yeah that sounds good
A	mm do you know one of these lights is broken?
B	is it?
A	yeah cracked
B	ha oh no
A	I'm pretty sure we would've noticed if we
B	we wouldn't have done that well how would you do that?
A	yeah how would you crack a light up there? how did anybody how did they crack the light originally up there?
B	playing football in the house or something?
A	no mm
B	uh
A	you alright there?
B	minor issue with the er fruit pouring
A	ah fruit
B	that's that was from
A	for a bag of frozen fruit?
B	mm
A	yeah cos like I I I love fruit but it's so expensive
B	I know it is I think it's much more sensible to get it frozen
A	yeah like
B	I suppose I'm only only if you're going to eat it in something not sort of fresh
A	yeah
B	cos that would be weird but
A	like three pounds for a punnet of blueberries just like no
B	ridiculous whereas in Morrisons I think I don't know whether they do it in this Morrisons but they have in
A	yeah
B	this deep for two quid of like frozen raspberries and stuff
A	it's not bad is it?
B	that's after I bought the
A	I bought the strawberries from Morrisons because they were one pound forty-nine and I just didn't think that was too horrendous
B	fresh fruit is ridiculous
A	but yeah it's like four pounds for a punnet of raspberries and a punnet not each but together you know you can easily spend ten quid on fruit which is really nice and everything but you know it's a bit excessive
B	bit excessive
A	mm I don't even like get you can get a bag of apples for ninety-nine P say yeah but apples are boring
B	I hate eating apples but I I quite like them so I'll eat them otherwise I don't really eat fruit at all
A	yeah I quite like pears as well but I'm going through a banana phase at the moment I used to hate bananas
B	me too I'm going through a banana phase as well
A	I kind of like bananas are one of those fruit that I either really really like them
B	me too
A	or I loathe them
B	I think quite a few people have that reaction to them
A	I wonder why?
B	oh yeah
A	mum's like that even the smell makes mum feel a bit queasy
B	what but sometimes not?
A	yeah
B	I can be like that especially if they're overripe even if I'm in a banana phase and they're overripe I can't
A	no yeah same
B	it makes me feel sick they have to be like perfect
A	mm yeah I don't like them green but I don't like them yellow I like them in between
B	yeah but brown? no
A	no god no
B	no I had brown I had loads of brown ones and I'm like oh god what am I going to do with this? so I froze them and they're actually fine
A	yeah like a frozen bananas are fine especially if you like blend them and do stuff with them or put them in like your breakfast thing but I wouldn't eat them just on their own
B	no but I suppose that's fine cos I I hate wasting stuff so I suppose that's quite a good thing to do if you've got like loads of brown bananas left over or make a banana cake
A	yeah
B	I like a banana cake
A	me too actually banana cake is yummy I don't do any baking I made a really really good Victoria sponge in the week when I was at home but
B	I'm having my mum's best friend and her girls you know
