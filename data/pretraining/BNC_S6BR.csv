A	that was perfect timing
B	yes
A	cheers
B	chin chin
A	do you think those bricks over there are for that building or for the
B	they look like
A	before you mean?
B	dug out in front of the building
A	oh yeah
B	so a big moment and out comes a giant carrot
A	you excited?
B	yeah I
A	oh we've got a plug
B	yeah so here it's already on EU and this is this is these ones are brilliant because you just put it in and then screw it fast
A	wow it's lovely
B	yeah so
A	it's so much lighter but it's cos it hasn't got a battery in
B	ah
A	ah it's smaller but it's a bit thicker
B	yeah
A	what do you call it ergonomic?
A	oh
B	like the success is more down to that doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	instead of the frame it is
A	apparently as well this is more this is a protective casing and it
B	it uses a yeah
A	it's made out of
A	the material is like solid the colour so if you scratch it it's still the same colour if you know what I mean?
B	yeah well same as this one
A	yeah and also the buttons are water water and dust proof
B	ah huh very
A	huh
B	oh no it speaks everything
A	and Spanish
B	and Spanish you can have the Spanish one or German it just doesn't speak Finnish or English
A	I think I'll let you take it out of its case
B	oh yeah I remember I had had that issue before you can
A	it feels more like a toy than this one do you know what I mean?
B	thank you what did I do with my? apparently you press it here and then there
A	I kind of nearly did it
B	yeah it is something like this
A	maybe if you tip it the other way up so you get it out like a cake
B	no I
A	like this
B	like a cake?
A	yeah like you know when you're getting a cake out of a tin or an ice cube
B	yeah that's the
A	out of a tray
B	that's the idea but I've got it now anyway
A	oh
B	I had yeah I have it yeah
A	yay
B	dual sim?
A	yeah
B	so you can actually get a Finnish sim if you'd like or a Spanish one or
A	well
B	or a South American one so yours is dual sim and mine claims to be
A	ah
B	yeah it's standard size
A	well if we knew I had the post stock I'd get a Finnish fin now sim a Finnish sim
B	well you would get a pay as you go
A	ask who?
B	ask
A	oh yeah
B	I wonder
A	so essentially would be the same person
B	well I'll I'll have to find out er so the battery is smaller
A	okay
B	but
A	I definitely think the water shortened the life of my battery
B	yeah
A	either that or or it wasn't a good a good model for battery life and this is the improved one
B	well they're both
A	does it matter which one I put it in? it doesn't does it?
B	no
A	I can lead a double life with this can't I?
B	oh god don't tell me that there'd be all these men that are after
A	oh yeah
B	have you found the slots?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	it was like you predicted that I was gonna get this phone
A	mm yeah I love it
B	we don't oh it has enough charge brilliant
B	yeah that's a bit like mine hello
A	oh is it automatic or English?
B	no English I didn't automatic might be Finnish
A	auto update time we'll put that on
B	yeah that's what mine said
A	no sim card
B	yeah
A	ah yeah what's it called?
B	hang on no
A	yeah
B	yeah oh how clever is that?
A	yeah
B	yeah you've got very little charge
B	oh yeah call
A	missed or received
B	just look for your messages
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh look twenty-twelve
B	I'm there twice
A	hope you got my love letter a picture
A	oh there's only three messages on it not yours is that all sims hold these days? three messages?
B	I I don't know
A	there might be a way of shuffling them round the different apps but if you go on this one and click on it there you can switch sim
B	yeah which obviously I can't yeah I think it
A	yeah should be able to put the torch on a hot key
B	yeah I haven't done any hot keys cling cling
A	chin chin
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the way the buttons are than this
B	we know it isn't
A	I think it's lighter
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	I can definitely confirm that that one is more expensive than that one
A	thanks
B	won't you get that abroad?
A	don't know oh probably not should I try? I've got ETP on there
B	I've got I've got
A	could be easy
B	don't you have to connect first?
A	dad roaming is off
A	yeah
B	whether
A	yeah
B	but not with Giffgaff so I have it anyway it doesn't really matter that I haven't got wi-fi but mobile data just takes more battery and stuff okay so let's see
A	oh
B	I've got mobile data
A	well the irony is it's you that needs the dual sim
B	data roaming's off ah hang on creating a secure connection
A	oh
B	maybe not a good idea
A	yeah I would
B	yeah
A	yeah my mum she was on my phone once and she said how'd you get back? she forgot you know the red and the green
B	mm
A	cos you don't have that any more you just have one single button on an Iphone don't you? really one touch button
B	doing what?
A	just a circle so you can't you don't have
B	yeah but for what?
A	a green and a red any more
B	oh yeah but if you but if you have a but if you
A	green for go red for stop
B	but if you if you do a call then you have to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if you do it as a smart
B	yeah
A	oh
B	and if nothing else helps you go for the er power button
A	should I leave the the screen still stuck?
B	mm
A	I wonder if this will be rare soon because I we didn't see any more did we? they seem to update it
B	yeah
A	I think because it I read a review somewhere and it says it's got the internet but it's in no way a smart phone it's a feature phone and it's trying too hard to be a smart phone by having the apps
B	oh
A	I guess like this one as well
B	yeah like like this one this one
A	yeah
B	yep cos there this is the funniest bit this one has
A	yeah
B	apart from my hot key directly to the internet but yeah yeah I definitely have only one sim as you can see in the description I had one sim like that and one from the side and the bit from the side was empty
A	oh well this phone comes as both
B	yeah
A	the one in the UK I think only they only market it as a single sim maybe that's why we couldn't find it and it was this one
B	unless it was a slightly different number
A	yeah
B	you want to send me a text to sort of you know it's
A	yeah
B	mm
A	erm don't know if they'll have it here
B	you did find it eventually
A	how do you get contacts up again?
B	yeah go back to just contacts and then just see
A	oh
B	yeah
B	there we go choose erm I can even call you right I'll do that so you'll
B	I've muted it before I stopped it
A	oh I have got you there
B	well yeah of course this is yeah silly me
A	ah
B	so you can send me a text
A	mm what checking the calculator works
B	yeah one plus ninety-nine is a hundred so calculator works
A	yeah
B	yeah I think these ones are better defined but you would have to have you have to be very good for a few tactile
A	ah yours are cool
B	these are still my two favourite texts including loads of exes as well
B	yeah they look very nice don't they? far nicer than the the old remember the very old phones with the grey screens?
A	yeah
B	it looks even nicer than an Iphone
A	no it's me
B	er
A	oh let my try coconuts
A	no I'll have bicycle
B	this is what they're digging it up for look there's a new grey box well it's olive
A	oh yeah

B	that's
A	oh yeah that's
B	apart from the black edges
A	that's not it oh
