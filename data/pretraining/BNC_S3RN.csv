A	so small
B	why have you got a new one?
A	because the old one belonged to
B	fair enough
A	and it cost like two hundred and fifty pounds and I was scared of it
B	how much did that one cost?
A	eh thirty
B	oh
A	yeah
B	how
A	how is he?
B	yes
A	I have absolutely no idea
B	okay
A	I'm assuming that he's
B	gone back to university
A	gone back and he's yes yes yes he is he is cos em
B	oh okay
A	so that's a five hour walk five hour car journey to be undertaken at half past nine at night
B	yeah that's odd
A	to come back on Sunday evening
B	for Pathfinders? Or is that in the morning
A	no just just because he's got a work on eh
B	Monday
A	Monday
B	oh I see
A	yeah
B	some people's jobs maybe something quite so
A	yeah and some people are very very busy
B	well actually if I drive two by the time I've driven for about two hours my back really hurts
A	like attention span-wise?
B	yeah
A	and what about your feet? Don't you get a cramp? Cos you have to hold your feet in the same position the whole time?
B	mm no
A	eh eh yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos you eat that
B	oh yeah it's got loads of vegetables in
A	mm
B	that's good so I've got ten to freeze I've given two away and I've got one to eat
A	yeah
B	oh
A	that's not many  That didn't come out right
B	it is like a really large one well it depends what you're cooking
A	I suppose
B	do
A	I have absolutely nothing in
B	oh but you never do
A	well I normally have something
B	I've got one curry one hot pot and ten bolognaise
B	ah but if you have a choice then it surely could be
A	yeah
B	I don't think I never I normally have much of an opinion I just want food
A	what did you do?
B	well I don't want to freeze it all
A	I mean surely it doesn't take
B	sorry?
A	surely it doesn't take that much longer from?
B	no but
B	ha
A	yes
B	oh dear
A	so when will you be?
B	em well
A	do teaching jobs tend to offer you on the day do they?
B	yes
A	ah
B	they expect you to tell them on the day whether or not you'd accept it if you're offered it
A	yeah
B	no
A	mm hm
B	and then they can either decide they can't wait or they can say okay we'll wait until then
A	and then you never go to second rounds then?
B	yeah
A	that is so much better than all the interviews I've ever been in
B	but you normally have to teach a lesson so it's like a whole day interview
A	mm
B	and they'll do that with maybe four or five candidates
A	things move quickly in the teaching world
B	yeah which is why if you apply for a job where they decide not to bother doing it in that way
A	and when do you have to let your school know that you don't want to to renew your job then?
B	eh so if I've signed my new contract Easter because I didn't not till the end of July
A	no wonder they wanted to tighten up  on you
B	well it's a pretty dumb dumb idea in the isn't it? Well I think they should have made it half a term cos that's what state schools are
A	okay
B	in order to leave at the end
A	and are they changing the the rules about things like that they can make you leave at
B	oh I don't know
A	just in teaching
B	no
A	sure
B	I want to get this into here but it's so heavy you see if I was to hold it would you be able to scrape it in
A	eh a spatula
B	this when I realise it's way more food than I need
A	well you're hungry because you didn't have much lunch
B	yeah I can have two dinners I think I can have two dinners
A	one and a half maybe
B	thank you
B	I feel like thirteen meals at a cost of I think it was under twenty pounds is quite good
A	mm
B	I suppose that's without the pasta but that's quite cheap and the cheese
A	and the tuna
B	have I told you about my drinking less?
A	no
B	yeah
A	no
B	I've decided to try and drink less
A	but that's a bad thing
B	mm
A	well you're quite tall
B	does that make any difference?
A	well
B	so I'm now drinking less and I'll probably I'm still drinking
A	so you're making up for it?
B	and then I started drinking loads and now I just started cos I  cos I  so I was drinking lots in a like paranoid I'm going to get a headache way
A	how much did you drink a day then?
B	about
A	yeah
B	you're meant to drink two litres?
A	two litres
B	yeah
A	but it doesn't all have to come from drink
B	yeah I think I'm now drawing drinking like the right amount rather than a ridiculously large amount like I was drinking
A	yeah
B	I have like
A	that's probably sensible
B	yeah cos also I go to the toilet every night and that's quite annoying
A	and then you complain that you can't sleep
B	yeah I know
A	I really hope my chicken curry doesn't overflow onto my cake
B	oh is it on top?
A	yeah
B	mm that would be unfortunate
A	well cos I'm
B	where are you meant to cook cakes in the oven?
A	on at the top
B	at the top?
A	yeah
B	I thought so
A	yeah
B	Cos I had a cake in the oven the other day
A	I guess it depends on the type of oven
B	oh I see
A	although I do have this sort of habit if one thing works well once I just try and repeat it rather than actually working out why it was that worked
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	really? Says who?
A	eh dieticians
B	that that's silly
A	that's silly cos if you  if you  don't then you don't sleep very well
B	you don't eat carbs after five?
A	yeah
B	Cos you're hungry you mean?
A	well yeah
B	mm
A	I guess
B	are you sure that every dietician says that?
A	every single one?
B	I mean like it's not just some weird ones?
A	I think generally the the idea is that you have a huge breakfast and eh with lots of carbs and then a medium sized lunch with lots of mm sort of that sort of stuff energy stuff and then by the evening you're not doing very much
B	mm
A	unless you're going out to play badminton in which case you probably can get away with it
B	you don't have time at lunch to eat lots of food
A	ah you do if you're French
B	I have a two hour lunch break
A	except all the teachers tend to have wine in their lunch break and then go back to lessons
B	do they actually?
A	no yeah
B	okay
A	the school I was in it was free so there was free wine with the
B	that's good
A	the staff canteen
B	mm
A	yeah
B	every day?
A	well as the mood takes them
B	that's quite a different attitude isn't it?
A	yeah
B	did the kids go home at lunch in France?
A	they can do
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so they start at eight and finish at six
B	six?
A	yeah
B	and then have homework on top of that?
A	but you wouldn't always have like some of the time you wouldn't have a a lesson as such you'd have like a homework class
B	like time to do your homework?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it was a private school
B	oh right
A	sort of university entrance exams
B	yeah
A	huge
B	did the preschool have a two hour lunch break?
A	no the preschool I wasn't I don't know what their timetable was like at all
B	okay
A	which bit?
B	ends at six?
A	em
B	they all do Saturday morning?
A	so once you get to I think it's secondary school you start doing Saturday mornings
B	mm hm
A	it's quite good logic cos like it stops the kids getting really tired but does em  have a weekend
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and would they do Wednesday morning?
A	which age?
B	the older
A	yeah they Wednesday morning unless they had they want to have something like study time or sports in the afternoon
A	oh I've just
A	what vegetable goes with curry?
B	with curry?
A	mm
B	em
A	korma
B	yeah okay
A	yeah
B	go on then
A	carrots peas broccoli eh
B	peas the most out of them
A	peas
A	mm
B	I'm full up now
A	that's the idea
A	I might do a
B	it probably doesn't matter that it's not something an Indian would have had
A	sorry?
B	probably doesn't matter if it's not something in Indian would've had
A	yeah
B	no
A	it is only for me
A	what is that?
B	isn't it the hoover?
A	oh
B	which I would
A	that would be good wouldn't it?
B	it would be quite amusing
A	I don't know what was going on last night but there were there was a police car
B	I was asleep or was I out?
A	eh
B	no I wasn't out last night was I? Was I out
A	you weren't here when I left
B	oh I know I came home from work at like seven or something
A	I do sometimes wonder about this estate
B	about what?
A	this estate
B	oh
A	the they're the trouble causers
B	yeah
A	what do they do?
B	em
A	mm
B	eh it was left at like the neighbour like about ten down that way
A	as you do yeah
B	yeah
A	right
B	from what she was saying
A	it sounds a bit claustrophobic
B	like she was saying oh you know the police often round there
A	but I don't know it's wouldn't you want to move out? What's so?
B	sorry?
A	what's so attractive about living opposite?
B	yeah I know
A	I was in the library the other day and there were people just having a full blown row
B	you are meant to be quiet in the library
A	I was just like
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't want to do that anywhere but in the library where everyone else is being quiet?
B	and also it's just rude in the library isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I think it was one and a half
A	yeah
B	how many children will tell me tomorrow that I wasn't there last week? They have a habit of pointing out the obvious
A	wasn't I? I thought I was
B	eh Jesus is going to feed five thousand people
A	yeah
B	it was five thousand men plus women
A	yeah
B	the children don't really understand thousands anyway
