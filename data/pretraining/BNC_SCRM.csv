C	yeah
D	Lagos that's that's I won two
C	oh right yeah brilliant
A	oh guys
C	I had this before
D	yeah thought I'd just bring it back round to you cos it's also a
C	cool
A	I think if we've got it if we if we can do it get these out and on cards as quickly as possible
C	yep yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	you know?
D	yeah cos you yeah
A	for the next game
D	yeah yeah that's the thing like there it's equipment is
C	yep get those put the
D	so if you've got a spare move and you're starting in a
C	yeah
D	in a city
C	yeah
D	and level up your
C	unless then you want me to take S達o Paulo from you and put
D	Khartoum?
C	Khartoum
A	or a quarantine
C	because I don't think I've got much to do now cos all I'm gonna go to do is go to Lagos
A	erm
C	if I ended in Khartoum
F	three
C	he ropes you in to do everything that mum smart enough to know what to do
F	ignore
D	you done a have you
F	ignore the
D	have you er
E	I don't know what I'm doing though
D	you're
E	no I'm a bit like a
D	boom you're a boom operator
A	you can if you put it easy on your shoulder like that
D	I don't think you need to
F	yeah
D	yeah
F	pretend the camera's not there
A	sure
C	just act natural like
D	okay
C	so you could do that and I could take
D	I think I but then
C	yeah but it's probably better for you to have more
A	well you can pick up equipment
D	yeah you can you can
A	you can
D	equip one of yours
C	I can pick up an equipment one
D	well to be fair there's three parts
C	right yeah
D	we could lose some ground anyway
C	yeah okay
D	but I am I'm
C	okay yeah
D	yeah?
C	yeah
D	erm
C	okay I'd say do that
D	so that
A	yeah so chuck chuck one on Moscow
C	having fun?
E	oh yeah
A	and one on
D	he's facing the wrong way
C	this is just your face
A	yeah to put what well if you you can't
C	and then for conversational goals
D	but you can do that at any time so
C	okay
D	we could use that save that for when we need it
A	it's
D	LA gets infected
B	but don't you wanna take two two quarantines now in case Moscow or Delhi goes?
D	we can play it any time though
C	okay
D	and Algiers?
A	er so that doesn't go we ignore that
C	do we lose a quarantine?
D	yeah
A	I don't know
D	yeah I think so
A	yeah but it's
D	a buffer
A	oh yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah
D	well that's I completely forgot about that
C	alright then yeah let's go then
A	okay well
D	are you at a research centre?
C	I am indeed
A	and you did need to be anyway
D	oh okay
A	for that
D	oh well
A	I thought I brought them but
C	but you could you could eradicate
D	yeah well that was why I remoted erm
C	right
D	do it on your go cos something else will come up
C	because if we if say
A	yeah
C	Madrid gets infected
D	or Saint Petersburg it's miles away
C	so one
A	so it's one
C	and bam
D	eradication
A	objective complete
A	so we've done one we have to do two more
D	which is
A	and then
A	and then
D	just need Africa
A	just Africa
C	so really we've just gotta play normal Pandemic now?
A	yep
D	so it is
A	after your yeah forget about the faded quarantine
C	so we're nowhere on
A	yeah
D	but I can give you
C	cos I've got I've got the three reds is the only thing
D	the thing you've gotta bear in mind is we can't direct flight er but you can move there by ground quite easily yeah
F	it's pointless me eradicating red at any point is it? what do we do we gain any
D	there's no gain from the
C	it makes the game easier
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	I just think we need to keep an eye on the fallen then really as well
D	yeah and and yeah
D	okay
A	yeah
C	Bangkok
A	mm
C	don't really want it to go to four
A	yeah we're losing them
C	Lima's on three
A	yeah we're losing South America a bit
C	dad's dad could go there in two
A	and where are you dad San Francisco?
F	oh I
C	you could just go to LA and them remotely
D	go to Lima
F	couldn't I go one there
A	yeah
C	yeah but isn't it better to be in LA than Lima isn't it?
A	possibly
C	no no not yet no what what you said was
F	so it would be
D	er it might be it might be more sensible to stay in LA yeah cos then you can get back across to
C	and Sydney could do a remote even in the future to Jakarta or wherever
D	yeah erm
C	remotely to Lima
D	yeah yeah
F	okay so
D	mm hm
F	two
D	mm hm
F	three
D	mm hm
C	yeah
D	and then
F	okay well tell me what's my last one then
C	could end in Sydney
F	ah yeah
C	or go to San Francisco so you can fly out
F	or
D	anywhere
C	but Sydney you you'd take in Jakarta
F	so what would you say? San Fran?
C	no if you went to Sydney now you could
D	by that connection
F	yeah
A	okay two
F	Mexico
A	okay we need to
C	that's not bad
C	Kinshasa and S達o Paulo
A	okay
C	then I can move to Kinshasa give him Kinshasa
A	okay
C	and then I can concentrate on the reds
D	so it's one of your perks you don't have to
C	me and dad
D	and what's his name?
C	professor Fate
D	so you
C	may share knowledge with a co-worker as long as one of you is in the city of the card that has been passed
D	so you don't you don't need to be in the same city?
C	just because we're co-workers yeah
D	so we need to be
C	but we have to be in a city that
D	it's like
C	yeah
F	Madrid
C	okay
D	yeah that's maximum
C	er have you taken two? yeah yeah yeah
F	it's
C	eradicated
D	eradicated
F	Beijing
C	okay
D	yeah do you wanna put it
A	okay so one two three not build but
C	yeah no
A	four
C	one two
D	how come you've given him two?
C	I gave him one in S達o Paulo
D	can you
C	cos my co-worker
D	can you only do that once a go or not?
C	no it just says you may share knowledge with a co-worker
D	see the first one you did
C	one
D	cool
A	and does
C	and then in Kinshasa
A	build as an action?
C	yeah but I haven't got any actions left
C	but
D	yeah
C	as an action build the structure the city you're in
A	so you'll do it next time or will well have got it
C	er Moscow is coming out
A	okay
C	before my turn and Karachi
A	alright so
C	so if you wanna do something to Moscow
D	I'll
F	okay don't forget to put Moscow
D	I can place a quarantine marker on Moscow
C	and somewhere else innit?
D	er somewhere else yeah
A	that's two
D	maybe what was on for three?
C	so it was it's Karachi's coming out
D	er
C	so Chennai is on two Algiers is on three
D	what about er back on Algiers?
A	well it's contained
C	Chennai is didn't you say it's more difficult if
F	if there are roadblocks again
A	yeah it's just easier to
C	okay
D	erm so you're
C	well
A	so dad you've gotta burn
D	gotta burn the blues
A	yeah burn the blues
D	just two
D	have any of them got
F	San Fran
D	have any of them got powers on them? any got
F	no no no no no no none of them have
D	which one is located the most centrally? Madrid
C	Madrid cos then he could remotely go Algeria so
D	or
A	no no you can't erm
D	oh yeah
A	no I don't think anybody can
D	no
A	we haven't we haven't er
D	the
A	the colonel can can he?
D	the colonel can erm
C	erm I don't know how much it matters
A	yeah
F	where do they go?
C	discarded
D	yeah colonel can remove faded from your city
C	erm
C	close
D	oh so that changes what's coming out next
C	what do you mean?
D	well previously we thought it would be Moscow and
C	yeah
A	no yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
C	okay not a black a blue would be good
C	okay can go three now
D	oh three
F	isn't it strange how some cities hardly ever come out
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah Bogota gots nothing
C	but in a lot of the games though
F	yeah
C	like I don't think Bogota has ever been a problem
F	Paris doesn't ever seem to be a massive erm
D	it's not a problem
C	yep
F	yes
C	okay thirty-three
D	ooh that's an outbreak
A	it's not an outbreak because it didn't go anywhere
D	but is it actually an outbreak? is it a classed is it a classed as an outbreak?
A	no it's not
D	does it change does it not change erm
A	make sure to increase the panic level though
D	yeah so that goes up to three
A	so it goes up to three
C	that happened before
A	er
D	so it's it's
A	it's rioting now
A	yeah yeah
D	so but they're not
A	see so actually
C	yeah yeah
A	oh it's two isn't it?
D	it's three
C	three now
A	no you had Paris
C	no Paris was three
D	no Paris was three
C	from the infection
D	the epidemic yeah
A	oh was it?
C	New York nothing
D	so I don't need these
C	one
D	and then I fly and then I go
C	you could pick up a thing from a thing
A	yeah if you've got a spare move
D	yeah so I'm in erm
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	shall I take a field hospital?
A	not yet no
D	discard any one any time to remove one faded figure from the city you're in so I could get a
A	it's up to you
D	I reckon a
A	do you wanna blow up those zombies don't you?
D	yeah
A	the only thing is
D	you can't treat them
A	you can't treat them anyway
D	yeah that would make sense
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	that makes sense
D	do I where are you?
B	yeah
D	your dad
C	but I I was thinking go to Buenos Aires to give him Buenos Aires
A	mm hm
C	build one two
D	so if I go

C	build and give him Lagos then
D	yeah
C	okay
D	what's in

D	so fire
A	can you can you yeah but you can't end in Bangkok
D	you can't
C	I I wanna concentrate on
D	mm yeah I can't yeah
C	and it is good for you to give me Bangkok and also because then one of us is gonna have an extra
D	but you can't you can't
C	is Bangkok in Asia?
D	yeah
C	the is that Bangkok there? no
D	it's as
C	no yeah

D	yeah
C	can't end in Asia and
A	but you've got red yeah
C	I wanna be giving dad Buenos Aires and Lagos
D	maybe maybe you could just throw come quarantines around it it's our only one but can you do that once to
C	Delhi could have one
A	I could do one in S達o Paulo
D	can how many quarantine's can you do a turn?
A	just one
D	right
C	not Delhi then
A	well where's dad?
F	er I was
A	dad's going to just stroll up Jakarta and sort out the
F	yeah well I was thinking of going there but it's easier for me to lose Jakarta and that one
C	you can't go into Jakarta
A	but can you remotely?
C	yeah
A	so he could remotely and then fly to S達o Paulo cos he's got S達o Paulo
C	and don't and not discard it yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
F	if Jakarta's full then do we
C	not really but it means that we might eradicate reds and if you eradicate it just makes life easier and we can do more upgrades at the end of the game
A	yeah I'm just gonna pick up some equipment there I'll pick up a few at the field hospital
D	the
A	yeah but we haven't got that many we've got
D	we've only got Jakarta
A	we've got Jakarta we've got erm
C	but also for future games as well
A	yeah yeah
D	so which one you putting the field hospital on?
F	I was just gonna put it on near Bangkok
D	don't you wanna put a grenade on a black?
A	yep
D	er what have you got? Terrano Mumbai
A	okay
C	okay
A	oh
C	just as well
A	mm
C	Chennai
A	oh my god goodness me
C	Lima
C	okey-doke
A	there then daddy-o
F	right so do you want me to get Jakarta or not?
D	you can do it remotely yeah
F	so one
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
F	two
A	wow
F	okay what's my last one?
C	if you come to Lagos
A	you
C	if you come to Lagos I don't have to go to Lagos to give it to you which is better
F	okay
A	it's quarantined
F	okay so
D	yeah yeah
F	rather than do it remotely
D	yeah
F	so that's is that my moves now?
D	yeah
A	yeah
F	if if I didn't go to Lagos
C	or or
F	do it remotely
D	you've only done you've already done one one remotely
F	ah only once per turn is it? okay fair enough
D	yeah
C	okay
F	Karachi
D	er blue
C	and another
C	that's
A	yeah
C	and and dad can fly to a military base and get me
F	yeah I've gotta check one of these
D	er
A	oh yeah
C	keep keep Hong Kong then
D	yeah get rid of one of the blacks
C	er not Moscow cos you might wanna fly there in a in a rush
F	Cairo's Cairo's
C	Cairo's on one yeah so Cairo
A	it's a good thing we
C	Beijing one
D	Beijing on three
C	Bangkok on two
A	yeah we don't want Bangkok to go
C	no
A	collapses
C	okay so I've gotta build one on Kinshasa
A	sorry but
D	forecast one quiet night
C	right first one I see to anyway
A	and that completes our objective
C	one
D	give him Lagos
C	two
A	how many you got there dad?
F	four
C	okay I could give him Buenos Aires now fly to Buenos Aires
A	er
C	by discarding
A	cos you can fly out of er
C	once per turn there's an action move from any city containing a structure to any city by discarding any city card
D	oh wow
C	so fly to Buenos Aires
D	yeah
C	four
D	that was
C	so keep Moscow
F	so not Moscow?
D	that was a strong move
A	yeah
D	so is that erm that's here one of his
C	all all-time forever actions okay a red
D	yeah
C	would be good now
F	I
F	ah

D	one more
C	infect Algiers
A	erm
A	no it doesn't go but
C	no but it goes up to four
D	four
A	collapsing
C	we've we've really thrown Algiers under the bus
A	yeah we have
A	go on then
F	I got
C	yeah so
D	oh man
C	you can get yourself to Hong Kong by flying and not discarding it
F	yeah
C	to Hong Kong if you're in Hong Kong because of our special relationship
F	mm
C	you can give me Hong Kong
A	yeah damn
D	well sorry Algiers
F	did we not see that coming?
C	so what does
F	but lucky you put er road
D	yeah
C	we haven't had any outbreaks and we should have had three or four now so
D	mm wait you just infected three didn't you?
C	no
D	oh god okay
C	okay Kinshasa dad can take Kinshasa remotely on your next turn as well dad
F	mm okay

D	yeah
A	yeah or
D	well yeah I mean forecast you play first don't you? so you can see and then if you need to do it
A	yeah
D	then one quiet night yeah
A	so where are you sorry
D	I'm in
C	Kinshasa
D	Kinshasa so I can pick up the military
A	but dad can
C	dad can cure it
A	cure it
D	I mean I can only pick up military equipment
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	from here
A	yeah
D	erm
A	and you haven't got any blacks to use the
D	mm
C	you can use your yellows for anything now
D	yeah
C	and you can and also you can go to Khartoum and fly out of Khartoum
D	Moscow's got a quarantine on it
C	no you couldn't do that cos you can't charter a flight out of a two
D	ah okay
A	really?
D	mm
C	we don't really pay attention to that
A	no we should more
D	erm yeah
C	I don't as a er I don't think we've done it wrong but
D	yeah like you say your dad couldn't have flown out of LA
A	no
D	which you didn't
C	yeah
D	erm
A	I think you should get a an equipment while you're there
D	just put a drone escort
A	yeah somewhere
D	onto
C	you could go to Beijing
D	yeah
C	but not really have to
F	I'm coming
C	dad'll go one two
F	I can go to Hong Kong
C	but you can't go to Beijing and cure it
D	so shall I go and cure
F	I can on my next turn
C	no because
A	well don't you wanna see what's coming out to dictate your moves? if is is Beijing gonna be okay?
D	probably yeah shall we look at the next six?
C	Beijing's in there I think but okay ready?
D	yeah
C	do you just look at it and rearrange it yeah?
D	yeah
C	okay
D	hm
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	again we don't really have to worry about these too much
A	no we have to do this
C	but we don't want outbreaks
D	mm
A	we don't want the panic level to rise we don't want Moscow to get into two
D	yeah we don't want that
C	but and
D	yeah well I mean will will Algiers come out again?
C	Algiers is here so it's only gonna come up
D	yeah
F	what was that
A	soundscape
F	no the early part I seemed to recognise it
A	oh yeah it was from erm
F	ah
D	so Jakarta we'll let go right? unless we're not trying to
D	in Karachi then cos it's not really
D	or Istanbul cos it's the only one that hasn't got any
C	well yeah yeah
D	well that's why we need to end the game quickly
C	dad's dad's
A	dad's
C	can
A	no
C	no that's okay cos dad's gone to Hong Kong anyway
A	yeah
C	but
F	so we can concentrate on reds
A	yeah yeah
D	like the the colonel can actually remove these guys as actions
C	hang on then hang on then
A	yep
C	we've got
A	okay
F	well
D	so shall I try and eradicate
A	yeah
D	er
C	but we've used that haven't we?
F	what's the other one you've got?
D	no that's the forecast so that one's
C	yeah
D	but then we're
C	what we wanna get is
A	yeah
D	mm hm
A	but we
C	but also no that no cities get damaged so if you can put a quarantine on Algiers or you could do it
A	yeah
C	protect
A	so whose go is it now?
A	so by the end of
D	mm hm
A	so
F	if nothing
C	if if it should it should do
A	yeah yeah
C	so we don't want Beijing to go we don't want Kinshasa to go and apart from that it's
D	okay so I just go one
C	or
A	yeah
C	go to Beijing and take off Beijing
F	yeah it's like yeah cos I can get it in one
D	yeah
C	but then you're not taking any upgrades
D	I yeah
C	okay
A	mm hm
A	okay well I'll I'll put a quarantine then
C	you almost wanna concentrate on the these bumpers on the black ones to to compensate for
A	yeah yeah
F	yeah like we don't wanna lose either of them
C	no
A	yeah
C	no
A	okay
D	Paris erm
C	yep
D	and
C	so then after that you could you could play one quiet night
D	mm hm
A	yeah okay okay
D	Jakarta gets one
A	okay I'll put a
D	where are you? which you can can you apply either?
A	yeah
D	or you can field hospital
A	no
D	mm
A	I mean I could do more than
D	first though first put a quarantine in Delhi right?
A	yeah because you know Delhi's coming up do we?
D	well
A	oh it's just come out but
C	it came out of here I think wasn't it coming up here?
D	oh ah yeah mm ah
C	from the forecast wasn't it?
D	no but I picked up Delhi yeah so
A	I could fly I could fly somewhere I could fly to Mumbai put one up I could fly to Baghdad put one up
C	you can't do it remotely again
A	no only once but er
C	er dad
A	wait for the drone
D	mm hm
C	do you think putting on a black
D	yeah
C	cos then if you get it your black which is bad you're compensated by getting a
D	a an equipment yeah cos you can't really use the
A	well it's it's a collapsing of fallen
C	Mumbai
C	Baghdad's on one
A	what hasn't come up
D	er coming up next we've got one quiet night anyway
C	but one quiet night could yeah
D	ah
C	yeah
D	so we know they're coming out we there's no
C	there's Istanbul
D	there's no point in playing one quiet night because we know that none of those are gonna affect anything anyway
C	yeah but if it's at the end of the game we've got two nights left one of them may as well be quiet
A	yeah
D	can you put a roadblock up?
C	you
D	cos if they
C	cos fly there and then use a quarantine on it
A	yeah on Mumbai yeah I'm just thinking Chennai's gonna come up right?
C	you can't get there
A	no
D	who who have you quarantined?
A	Mumbai
C	not an epidemic then
A	yeah
C	alright
A	so
D	we'll play one quiet night then yeah
C	but you have to infect
D	you have to infect yeah
C	Riyadh
A	no that's good
C	why?
A	because it's empty
C	no but a blue would have been
A	oh yeah but
C	would have been better
A	you could been any of
C	so this can be anything now but it's
A	well no one person can do one quiet night
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	before I've Cuba
D	no
A	no
D	one quiet night
C	one quiet night
F	okay so I cure it
D	that's gone up to four now as well
A	yeah
C	one two no he's not in a research station
D	yeah
C	yeah
F	no I
C	dad's blue
D	you need to be in a research centre in order to cure a disease
F	can I burn it?
A	no
C	no you do that after
A	first you wanna er remotely
F	oh so and er
C	Kinshasa no leave
F	okay
C	two
A	mm hm
D	now you can cure
A	now now cure it
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
F	three
A	three
C	hang on then
D	now give them Hong Kong
F	okay
D	but
C	no but then I've got my red
F	oh sorry
D	that's four
C	to help we're really close to
F	four I've got one left
C	okay so two not an epidemic
F	Lima
A	okay
D	that's you keep that
F	Beijing
D	okay
A	okay
C	okay infect three
A	yeah
F	New York
D	no
A	no
F	Lagos
D	one on Lagos
A	okay so this means
F	Tokyo
D	two for Tokyo
A	that's good excellent excellent
C	alright then
D	so you need to go to a research centre
C	one shall I take a thing? put it on a black?
A	yeah
D	yeah what do you want? er hazmat?
C	hazmat does hazmat allow you to go into the black areas which you might be
D	discard this card when starting your turn in a city
A	yeah
D	er so it's kind of like a protective field erm
C	okay
D	do you want did you put it on a
C	one
A	field hospital
D	yeah
C	Hong Kong's quite a good base isn't it?
A	playing the long game
D	technically you might wanna put it on a city a card that isn't very good
C	okay Jakarta
D	cos you're less likely to yeah so Jakarta
A	yeah
C	cos you're not gonna use it for anything else
D	yeah yeah
C	three
F	can we get to all of those?
C	no just three
F	ah
A	oh no that's just er
D	oh that was that was in the er
D	in the thing weren't it?
C	alright so
D	succeed
F	can we what
C	pretty pretty comfortable really the er
F	what catastrophic
D	well I think we had zero outbreaks
A	I think having the
C	Algiers we we sacrificed Algiers quite a lot
D	Algiers
A	for the world though
C	and then and nothing else no other no other cities got bumped up?
D	no
A	no
C	at all?
D	no
C	pretty good then
A	okay so
D	that one's
C	it says here at the end of your first game in June before selecting your game end upgrades open the following door and then draw this card
D	W?
C	W
D	W double W
A	dad do you wanna write down our results?
F	so what do we get for missing a month?
C	we didn't miss we just didn't win it
A	we just
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	oh
A	it was about a quid
D	alright
C	just the four just the fourer
A	oops
F	so win
D	that's right
C	win solid win
A	yep
D	damn skippy
F	okay
C	so do you wanna read W then dad?
C	it's
F	oh oh oh
A	ah
F	players may add three equipment stickers to any city cards in the player deck
C	we've run out of them all
D	so you can choose to do that as a game upgrade
A	oh okay yeah
C	ah right
D	so you can
F	that's a bit sneaky because what if you'd used them all in the game
A	yeah
F	you wouldn't be able to do it
D	mm
F	we've only got two anyway
A	yeah
D	but
C	so we could do that now then
F	yeah
A	but
D	does that mean you you lose a game upgrade?
C	does it? it doesn't say that
F	players may add three
C	oh sorry yes
F	as a game upgrade
C	so we just stick that into the where the game ended up the end game upgrades are
A	yeah they're over there aren't they?
C	yeah
A	we get to choose
C	where do we we stick that one in now?
A	well we can't stick it in we just sort of remember it
D	has it got a sticker on it or not?
F	yeah it is it is a sticker
C	no
F	it goes somewhere
C	are you sure it doesn't go in there? doesn't go in the
D	oh
D	it's got it's own bloody spot
C	so I would say
F	yeah
C	we then we did put so many stickers on we don't necessarily need it for this game
D	and I wouldn't upgrade but I wouldn't use that as an upgrade
C	alright and then it says
D	considering we
C	continue reading this card then
D	okay
A	oh scratch
D	er nope
A	a syringe
D	living on the edge
C	here you go
D	oh it seems quite
D	don't wanna
C	coin?
D	finger finger'll do it
C	yeah it hasn't really been that clear yet
A	yeah so we get to choose two
C	yeah
A	so for any game played in July after setup and before the first turn begins either
C	mm
A	yeah
C	cities like that
A	but you know you can still funnel the virus you know
C	mm
D	so we either add a
C	well we're not gonna have three are we? we're not gonna have three
A	no we haven't got three
D	so yeah you only add one equipment sticker
C	oh right
D	add one equipment sticker or add three red blocks
A	okay so we can choose the game end upgrades I would say one of them should be erm a positive mutation because we've er
D	you only get to do that when you eradicate one
A	yeah
D	so make the most of that
A	so it's an efficient
C	yeah that's good isn't it?
D	is that the only one?
A	yeah it goes up to
D	right
A	so shall I put that on erm avian swine flu?
D	yeah
C	well the only thing is yellow hasn't got the
C	right okay
D	are the
C	yeah we put it there by mistake
A	right
C	well we put it there and then it got over overridden
D	er
C	nightmare innit? don't just be
A	er I thought you were gonna say swine avian swine flu
F	I did
A	I'll take that criticism
D	that's
A	no it's random
C	no it's like whatever was the most
D	right
C	whatever
D	yeah that's unfortunate
C	the thing that happened mid game is I count whoever's got the most then something bad that's happened
D	and what other upgrades do we get?
A	you can have there's only one character upgrade left and it's called erm archive access
D	no
D	no
A	but we can put it on another character or an unfunded event
D	so you basically get to remove three three cubes?
C	but you'll only remove
C	you only remove cubes from
D	yeah
C	you're only gonna bother to use that to to take yellows off
D	if if yellows
C	but you've got it yellows are a problem if yellow's a problem you wanna keep the yellows to eradicate maybe
D	not ah oh not necessarily
C	yeah you wanna eradicate it yeah yeah yeah which just happened which happened there
D	yeah then I can be like
C	yeah to eradicate it yeah yeah
D	oh wow so
A	oh well then yeah we can get to permanently have a research station or permanently have
C	normal ones like
D	where?
C	again if this is the objective we've got every time we've got
F	that's quite a good one
D	so that'll be
C	that's not a good one for
D	so
C	so you could do Algiers
D	yeah
C	no and that's not all yeah that's always gonna be a military base
D	yeah
C	so that's not bad
F	that one as well
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	make
A	for dad
C	that dad but he did it cos he flew to
A	yeah yeah
C	but we did forget about that
D	what was that?
C	you can go between military base and military base
D	can you?
C	dad dad actually can't cos he's he's medical he's not military
D	but there was a medical base
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah it was fine but
C	yeah yeah but I don't think we've got
D	oh so so you can't travel between
C	military base and military base unless you're a
D	your character must have a military right yeah
C	relationships
A	oh yeah
D	maybe built
C	so dad's got a relationship one it'll have to be you and dad but that would be good for you
D	cos that was that was really really handy
A	yeah
C	so friends with if you start your turn in the same city as a friend you may look at but not rearrange the top two cards of the player deck
D	mm
C	not great
A	I think we should upgrade you
D	this one the co-worker
C	yeah that's good
A	yeah
C	er
D	mm
C	so that's that was pretty good and that one was pretty good
D	mm hm
F	what about the scars? what did you say?
C	permanent roadblocks
A	well that's only when you erm
D	how many permanent roadblocks?
C	we could permanently roadblock Algiers
A	no
C	unless like you know
A	yeah
D	unless like yeah unless some
C	say say say it was Moscow that was on four or five
A	yeah
C	one two three is perfect apart from that
D	so there isn't another option to have a co-worker
C	no this family members is the one me and
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah that one yeah
A	and this is you know if you're in a military boat basically and quarantined in a adjacent
D	I think that's probably a good thing
C	yeah yeah
D	was this soldier good that round?
D	I
C	we weren't going for that objective though so
A	yeah
D	I don't think he was probably as useful as say a researcher was or as a dispatcher was
C	wasn't there an extra
A	no I don't think so
F	what permanently?
C	yeah
F	that sounds too good to be true
A	yeah too good to be true
C	mm hm
A	you can upgrade
C	three roadblocks but it's not upgrading
A	oh yeah no upgrading if you know
C	yeah or in a relationship
D	I I think
C	are good because if you we can only have two next game and this is on a card isn't it?
D	I think the colonel's gonna be good because he can actually remove faded figures
A	I think something's gonna kick off soon with the zombies aren't they?
F	yes they're bound to
D	yeah I I think we need to level up
C	and
A	is there anything that compliments him then?
D	erm
C	oh god
D	well he can't even discover
A	yeah
D	what so with roadblocks how do you get past them?
A	you just have to pay a
F	yes
D	did we do that?
A	well we didn't move through
D	cos I I was in
D	I'd roadblocked it
A	yeah maybe you did yeah
D	I mean that's the
A	yeah he's fierce yeah
D	are you allowed to move into a city with
A	and and
C	mm because anyway we might lose
D	yeah
A	well you can give him as I said I read online the soldier is good
D	mm but I think this the colonel can actually take these bastards out
A	okay
A	oh yeah
C	or the colonel
A	we haven't used though
D	well we haven't used them yet have we?
A	I
D	I think
F	the only thing is you think you're gonna lose er one or possibly two
D	mm
F	of the one from scar soon
A	yeah
D	well there was there was no
F	yeah so er
C	but then he's not in
F	if the surface for some reason they're not er
D	mm hm
A	you may take the military shuttle
C	what date is it today?
A	oh if you're not
D	if you're not military
A	yeah
C	date is it today?
D	the twenty-third
C	yeah
A	just pick a pick a
D	I think erm
F	that's that's
A	for who? for your  colonel?
D	but that's only in a military base so that kind of
A	well there's
C	yeah but you're only gonna do it in Paris but Paris will always be there so
D	do we wanna put another military base in somewhere?
C	no because I think if we were playing
C	he's pretty good at that
F	well I think that's a good one I mean you've got how many military bases have you got?
D	yeah so basically
F	yeah but these are temporary these get reset
D	yeah but but you're right every
C	Paris doesn't
A	Paris doesn't
D	if we cos to be fair in the game if we're gonna have seven military bases that makes you
C	yeah
D	a lot more things doesn't it?
C	yeah yeah yeah I'd go with that
D	so local pressure who are we gonna give it to?
A	erm
C	your
D	the colonel or Jean-Claude Van Damme?
A	yeah
C	it's erm
A	he can actually sort that
C	how many end up end er
A	two
C	so where was the other one?
A	the erm
C	yeah okay
A	erm yeah
A	for what what do you mean?
C	posterity
F	I will take a photo of the
D	got a piece of paper?
A	does it say what the mission is for next month?
C	so just draw this card just before you set up your first game in July
F	I just have yeah
A	pandemic break
C	yeah
F	oh that no on that er
F	no it'd be good cos we can do that while we're eating and
D	just biro
F	no
C	the colander game?
F	no the acting one that mum
C	oh the murder mystery thing?
F	you did it for
D	yep
F	and it fitted in round a meal
C	could do
F	yeah I think it's a good thing to take a photo at the end of the board anyway at the end of the game anyway
C	yeah
A	give these to burn
D	the only thing this one needs is a military base in the region
A	yeah
D	mm hm
F	so do you want the stats of how many won and we've lost
A	okay
D	fifty-fifty?
F	well we've played nine
D	won four lost five
C	no I'd say won
F	won five lost four
A	that's pretty even that's pretty good
F	I think we've lost the games that
F	so what when we come to December what do you think's
A	well Algiers and
D	Algiers for
A	burning
D	well there's nothing else that bad that can happen to you
A	yeah that's
C	already in North Africa
F	but what's the what's the saying? that once you've made
C	oh you
F	there are more variations than grains of sand in the universe
A	it's
C	I dunno
A	I dunno if it's nine but yeah something
F	it's something ridiculous like that
A	oh yeah I think
E	clear the table everybody please?
F	yeah
A	yeah
A	as usual
F	no
A	no it's a co-opt
F	it's a cooperative game
E	where is it?
A	yep
E	it's not a team
B	did it go well?
A	saved the world
B	oh super stuff I was
A	oh yeah I'll change it to I'll change it to happy now
B	no no but like does it not kind of make you feel really anxious the whole time?
A	that's the point
