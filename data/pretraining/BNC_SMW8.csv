A	is that the
B	yes cos I had one it's for the the Air this is the
A	oh
B	Ipad Air that I won for doing the values competition
A	oh do you know what? they were fantastic
B	yeah weren't they? really good
A	who drew all of
A	that's that's amazing
B	mm
A	cos
B	cos she said
A	cos I tried to work out who it was cos we didn't have any idea that
A	have you seen them?
A	they're absolutely erm
B	I've got them I can show you
A	they were really good
B	it was it was a thing with erm sorry it's chaos here at the minute it was a thing with work that erm it they'd got like you know like a mission statement they got the values and
A	we care
B	we we care we love our stuff er
A	don't pass the buck
B	yeah that's right stuff like that
A	mm
B	so we the you could do it in teams and
A	yeah
B	and
A	I didn't realise that she was so talented before
B	yeah oh I know and it's it's definitely a a hidden talent
A	I don't know why she doesn't
B	yeah
A	it always interests me to know what people think your talents are because you go around and you talk to people at work all the time but you don't really ever they're so
B	yeah people who are musicians or all sorts aren't there? there's erm
A	we used to er we sometimes talk about who we think's got all the interesting stories and who are the who are the hidden gems
B	mm
A	everyone's got a little something though haven't they?
B	yeah well I I was just went today to my real dad and his wife over in Boston went over there and had a meal erm and
B	she got it out and she's only say only learning it erm
B	and I didn't wanna cut my nails down and I kept trying to do it without and I was thinking well I can do it pretty much but this teacher was no no no no so yeah and I said well I won't play it then you know went onto brass instruments when I got to secondary school but so I said oh let me have a go let me have a go so we got this thing here and I was sorta like oh yeah and
A	ah cool
B	Row Row Row Your Boat going
A	if I think if you're musical you're musical and I think
B	yeah
A	some people can learn it I'm not saying that it's kind of a
B	no no
A	it's not definitely a a dead thing if you're not musical but some people are naturally talented I think at
B	yeah
A	at music and it's a lot it it's a bit like language as well I think you
B	yeah
A	could learn a language but
B	yes
A	some people are naturally that's their their thing
B	yeah
B	yeah I totally agree
A	because I can hardly remember any of the language that I learnt when I was at school now
B	mm
A	and I thought some of it might come back when I was cos I went to Paris a few weeks ago and I thought some of it would come back
B	yes I was gonna ask you about that
B	yeah
A	but it really didn't not beyond the basics
A	although I bumped into somebody when we were back in Kings Cross and I was like
A	cos and afterwards I thought we're probably both English cos erm
A	and they said
A	you
B	yeah
A	doing the little pleasantries cos
B	yeah you do you do
A	I'm really a firm believer that if you smile and erm
B	mm
A	kind of say hello please and thank you you can't be
B	no that's it I always think if you're going anywhere you should try and do at least hello please and thank you and goodbye in their language
A	people then can't be mean to you can they?
B	the only time I struggled with that was when I went to Russia because I was trying to learn it before I went and just couldn't the pronunciation the words were so hard and so foreign it's their way of thinking
A	yeah
B	so when I
B	it was just
A	just not sticking
B	no no whereas I think European languages they're quite similar aren't they a lot of them? so
A	mm
B	and the sounds and the the way your mouth works when you make the sound it's the same so
C	I like to try and learn one to ten as a challenge
B	one to ten?
C	yeah
A	that's good
B	mm
C	I know it in English sort of French French German and
B	yeah
A	that's really good
B	yeah
A	and I said erm er
B	yeah
A	he looked
B	mm
A	at me then
A	so I was trying to round it to ten but I said to him five
B	yeah five
A	cos I thought he looked at me in a bit of a strange way to say I was
B	yeah
A	giving him a a bonus
B	yeah probably to give you a tip by giving you a fiver
A	hard hard-nosed negotiation
B	yeah
B	what would you like to drink? would you like some wine or would you like something else to start or would what would you like?
A	I'll have a glass of wine with dinner I think
B	okay
A	erm can I have some hot squash?
B	squash yes
B	we have apple and blackcurrant
A	yes that'd be lovely thank you yeah
B	that okay?
A	when erm I went to China in two thousand and six so ages and ages ago
B	mm
A	and erm absolutely brilliant I definitely recommend it
B	mm
A	and I bet it's changed loads since cos they
B	yeah
A	this is before they had the Olympics they were doing loads of building work
B	yes
A	just went to Beijing for about ten days and had a fabulous time but back into our hello please thank you
A	it was really
A	we didn't have any like
B	they're all going er?
A	erm cos I think
B	yes that rings a bell
A	and then we were saying
A	and I think it's close but not quite the right pronunciation
B	no
A	and erm we didn't have any like
C	yeah well one of my sort of second cousins is erm
B	what does
A	what does
B	and if she rolls round in fits of giggles
A	probably like a beer a something
B	yeah
C	yeah but I'll have to ask her see if she knows what it means
A	oh and another Chinese pronunciation thing I was in a Chinese restaurant
B	yeah
A	but the person I was with said that sounded awful
A	like you were mocking them
B	yeah how many pieces of salmon would you like?
A	oh just one for me please yeah
B	one?
B	I can do that
A	that is lovely meaty salmon
C	mm
B	I know
A	where did you get that from?
A	that's really good
B	yeah
A	uhu
B	took it got it all fresh for me
A	it's always good to do a little check
B	not
A	yeah
B	I was just thinking how many mezzes in mezze but yeah it was yeah
A	were
B	no
B	no that is funny she's actually just started her own cleaning business cos she was cleaning for a company and everyone was
A	yeah
B	bless her
A	a lot of people that have had an
B	yeah
A	stop eating
A	fish altogether
B	I ended up yeah no I ended up being I was at hospital where they had to get out the I was gonna say ornithologist but that's birds the
C	oncologist?
B	oncologist no that's bones
C	what's it for?
B	ear nose and throat
C	erm
B	throatologist
C	no
B	but
B	they they had getting him out anyway and he had
C	ah
B	he had to come and get with a
A	it must be excruciatingly painful
B	and actually yeah
C	it's made me paranoid though as well
B	and when when he got ready he he was sort of like oh yeah then he went actually it's gone he said but it's torn your throat
C	really paranoid
A	mm
B	I can see so it really was a you know
C	see mum's fine since that she eats them she well me I literally will pull it apart and chew in my mouth about ten times cos I'm so paranoid about swallowing a fish bone
A	yeah there's nothing worse though when you you feel a bone and then you're like
C	yeah
A	oh I'm gonna get it out and then it's it's not there anymore and it's like where's the bone gone?
C	yeah
C	yes
B	cos seeing as I'm all fishy hands
A	there is no urgency
B	no no it's fine
A	the erm
B	oh yes
A	yes and a
C	oh yeah they did yeah
A	little
B	yeah
A	skewer stick
B	yeah
A	or
B	and cos it that was ridiculous cos it was the little round dumplingy things and they got cocktail sticks in to hold them together
B	and they'd broken in half cocktail sticks so they actually
A	yeah
B	oh what the hell's that? and spat it out
A	so dangerous
A	thank you very much
C	there you go
A	er it's so dangerous
C	mm
A	concealed
B	yeah oh yeah
A	sticks
B	they are so it seems if to me like they've got like a er erm a a like a gambling thing going how many people can we try and kill with skewers?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	this is the same person
B	yeah
A	and she fell in
B	yes
B	yes
C	I wouldn't wanna do punting I'd be scared of falling in
A	I think generally it's pretty stable
B	oh yeah
A	like I don't think it's easy to fall in
B	well people tend to try and jump from one to the other don't they occasionally? and then they fall in but yeah she just fell in didn't she?
A	cos they're quite wide
A	she's a little bit clumsy she's a little bit
B	well she's constantly losing
A	precarious
B	like breaking her phone isn't she? or she drops it down the toilet or she drops you know breaks it and
A	she falls over she
B	yeah
A	drops stuff she breaks things she's a bit chaotic
C	I'm clumsy but relatively lucky if that makes sense so like I trip all the time and I stumble and I drop stuff but it never seems touch wood to to do any damage or break anything like I I nearly dropped my phone down about three flights of stairs at work my old job the stairs go round like in a spiral and there's railings all the way down I took it out my pocket and just went like that and just launched it and it fell and the the barrier like the bars are there and it landed against the bars and I went
A	oh
C	well that was lucky
B	mm
C	I dropped it under my car the other day
C	but erm pretty much every morning when I walk to work I trip over my
A	cos you did
C	yeah that was skating that was doing a jump and doing it wrong I hurt myself skating quite a lot but again not normally apart from that it's not too bad
A	mm
C	so like I've actually got a massive bruise on my leg at the minute from where I
A	well one of my friends I took her ice skating and she fell off the ice
C	mm
A	so she was one foot on the ice
C	yeah
A	one foot off on the rubber
C	yeah
A	and she somebody came and took her
C	yeah
A	someone came and just knocked that from underneath her
B	oh wow
C	yeah
A	she fell off the ice onto her wrist
B	yeah
A	and erm she broke her wrist really badly so she went
B	mm
A	ice skating but didn't fall over on the ice
A	fell off the ice and
A	er
C	yeah lots of people
A	mm
C	get up
B	thing is sometimes you have come home and tell me you've done an almighty crash bang wallop
A	mm
B	and it's just like not a bruise not anything
A	no
B	and other times you do the slightest thing
C	well like this I
C	but I I
C	take a
C	flying superman fly
C	and the bruise I get is
C	like the faintest littlest bruise and I'm like that really hurt
C	and I've got a bruise here and I don't even know how I've done it it looks like someone has basically punched me on the leg
C	I've just got three finger fingermarks on my leg and I'm like have I done that? maybe I've fallen maybe I've hit myself
C	but I don't even remember like
A	ah it's very strange
C	yeah I'd like bruises for the momentous falls rather than the silly things really
A	I once was doing I can't remember what it's called now erm the erm I can't remember what any of this stuff's called erm
B	oh yeah spiral
A	where I'd grabbed it over my head
A	and I just pulled it too far
B	yeah
A	like I was
B	yeah
A	and obviously I had my hands on my other skate so
B	yeah
A	I literally couldn't stop myself
A	and I can't no cos I'm not that flexible so it was just a one-armed
C	oh where you just hold it hold it up
A	jolly yeah
C	and you catch it I've done that because one minute your arm's there and the other one's there and you're like I'm going down
A	my whole kneecap was
C	yeah
A	literally black
C	yeah
A	and then underneath the kneecap was black too
C	yeah
A	I don't know how I'd even managed to do that
C	see I do that it swells up goes red and then it's fine the next day and there's no bruise and I'm like
A	yeah
C	I like
A	I'm just starting to try and get the
A	yeah it's
C	but I'm doing it backwards cos I'm like if I go forwards
B	well I can't even stand up on the ice I don't even want to think about the thought of standing up I just
A	death wellies
B	you know the hire shop death
A	those death wellies
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	but you not reverse
C	they have to do up nice and high
A	they're crap
C	but they're not very good in general I hate them I'd never
A	I tried them once after I'd been skating for a long time and I couldn't physically stand up they were
B	yeah
C	they're so they're really blunt and they're not very supportive and they
B	mm
C	you
A	they're entirely wrong for your feet and your ankles
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm amazed that more people don't have incidents
C	I suppose though most people that go and use them aren't gonna be going back quickly they're just generally
B	suppose they're
A	learner lurch yeah
C	last time
B	yeah
C	but then that's
B	learner lurch
A	yeah
B	oh I love it it's excellent
C	yeah no I
C	wear another pair of them ever again
B	ah I don't
A	I don't know if your mum said but I was I'm
B	I have
C	you should yeah
B	well I've mentioned the fact that you're thinking about maybe going in and having a bit of a skate and
C	yeah
B	yes
C	yeah you should cos mum was saying about my old ones but I said mine are knackered like I've really knackered the support in them that's the problem
A	yeah
C	and if you're somebody that that has skated in the past you're gonna want something with a bit of support mine are just awful so like I'm gonna sell mine for about forty quid I think but they're literally you could like bend them
C	but for someone who's a beginner starting learning to skate they're absolutely ideal but
A	yeah
C	for anyone that can actually skate it
A	I probably I want to get new ones but at the same time I'm not
C	yeah oh god yeah I hate that part of everything
A	so
C	I just hate the fact that I'm not allowed to jump until they're broken in
A	I wanna jump
A	let me jump
C	don't like it
A	but my blades are so old now that they've pretty much been sharpened as far as they can go and
C	yeah the rock has like gone all and
A	you're still enjoying it then by the sounds of it?
C	yeah love it I've got a lesson tomorrow morning so I might take them tomorrow night actually on my way home from work
B	mm
A	so what do you? erm so you have lessons for free or? dance or?
C	erm yeah free I tend to do erm I do a little bit of dance but not very often I prefer free
A	cos I think if I went back now I'd probably do dancing which is another
C	yes
A	so I can't decide whether to get dance skates or
B	so tell me what's the difference between free and dance?
C	erm well freestyle is like all the jumps and the spins and all that sort of side of things
B	mm
C	whereas dance is the patterns and you do it to like
B	okay
C	erm but there's now also free dance
B	I'm now visualising line dancing I hope you realise which I know is not quite what you do
A	yeah it it you do it in partners generally
C	careful
B	it's alright these knives are so sharp
C	yeah you're actually erm
B	gosh that was very lucky
C	you
B	that's probably not the best way to do it
C	on the ice in a sense because it's a set pattern and set steps that you do to this music
B	yeah okay
C	whereas freestyle you kind of when you get a programme for freestyle it's tailored made up really
B	so and also so then the pairs so when you see the ice skating at the Olympics or something like that then the pair skating is when they're skating round but he's lifting and they're doing that's
C	okay that's that's
B	that's free
C	that's paired
B	oh yeah that's what I mean rather than dancing
A	although the dancers do do
C	yeah
A	free interpretive styles so Torvill and Dean were dancers
B	yeah
A	the pairs
B	okay
A	you can normally they're the women are very small and the men are very big and they literally are they chuck them
A	they spin so it's
B	right
A	all about spins and jumps and
C	yeah
B	which is like when they do the what's that famous Dancing on Ice? is it?
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	when they do that that is that sort of thing more that they're doing
A	yeah they go into that a bit more
B	yeah
A	it's kind of a combination between
B	yeah
A	dance well
B	yeah
C	there's yeah they started free dance now as well which is like a combination of dance and freestyle so if you don't necessarily wanna do freestyle and you don't necessarily wanna do dance cos it's patterned
B	yeah
C	you can do free dance and it's basically you do a a number of jumps and spins
B	so you do dance
C	but it's more like you'll get like a jazz piece of music for example you'll do lots of twizzles and lots of
B	right
C	footsteps and footwork and stuff so it's kind of in a way a combination
B	okay
C	so you're not doing that many jumps and spins and you're marked a lot on your footwork and steps
B	okay
C	and again the I mean the costumes are different so for like a free a freestyle thing you'd have quite a short skirt with the with the dress as a girl very glitzy very sparkly for the dance you tend to have longer dresses like not like ballroom length but they're they tend to be longer skirts and free dance as well longer skirts because it works better with the flowing and stuff and it it looks prettier in a way
A	it's generally erm generally done by older people isn't it?
C	I mean it can be yeah
A	but lots of people do do dance when they're younger
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	but I mean we've got we've got a girl in my
B	you might do free and then go on to dance as they get older idea?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	she's really talented at dance
B	yeah
C	and erm it depends what you enjoy I mean if you don't like throwing yourself around and getting bashed and bruised and damaged cos you tend to do that a lot more in free than you would in dance cos dance
B	mm
A	and dance blades are slightly different
B	mm
A	cos they have shorter backs because erm
B	mm
A	because toe picks obviously give you leverage for jumping
B	like mushrooms?
A	yeah I love mushrooms
B	yeah
A	erm
B	that's what I thought but I just wanted to check
A	so your backs are smaller
B	yeah
A	and your fronts are smaller
B	right
C	mm
B	right
C	course you don't need that as a dancer because generally you don't jump
A	they get in the way
C	yeah and you can
B	yeah
C	catch them very easy and go flying when you don't want to
B	so what are hockey skates like then?
C	they're completely round they don't have a toe pick at all because they don't need to use a toe pick at all
B	okay
C	for any reason they're they're just
B	yeah
A	they don't really have a back either
C	no
A	so it's literally like a
B	yeah
A	it's a bit like that
B	yeah
A	like attached to the bottom of a
B	mm
A	oh skating one O one
B	yeah
B	oh yeah it's it's interesting cos I know when you're explaining to me cos you do the test things you do which are the field moves and I was like uh
C	yeah
B	now let me see if can remember field moves are actually like an isolated move that they're doing the actual technique that you're doing
A	yeah
B	and making sure you're doing that particular move right
A	yeah
B	so even though you do certain
C	no exactly
B	it's cos with routines
A	although they are linked
C	yeah
B	like with routines you get marked on the like your skate ability don't you as well?
unknown_female	mm
B	and you as well as the actual things they are linked okay huh
A	so for a field moves test you would have a set of maybe I don't know how many it is
C	four there's four moves in a set generally
A	and then there's a few sets isn't there? so you would set off
B	yeah
A	around the ice and then generally you'd go down each side
B	yes yeah
A	so erm outside edges might be one of them
C	yeah
A	so you have to do
C	which is what I'm doing at the minute
A	what is it?
C	back out and in I'm doing so yeah well you wanna put four or five in
A	four
C	no more than five they don't like well they don't want any less than four
A	it's really precise so you kind of know what pattern you're gonna make on the ice
B	yeah right
A	when you're learning them I don't know if they do the same here but they used to
C	they they do sometimes yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	erm
A	and you'll know what the next move is that you're gonna have to display
B	yeah
A	so you'll go round and do a length of four and then you'll maybe do a different move down the inside?
C	yeah so for example my first one now that I'm doing in my level two I do back outside edges down one side
B	yeah
C	and then back inside edges down the other
B	yeah
C	and you have to make it equal so if you do five on one side you gotta do five on the other if you do more on one side than the other you'll you'll lose points for it
B	right so it's it's very precise that you've gotta do this and this in a certain way in a certain time in a certain space
C	yeah
A	it's a certain length it's a certain distance
C	and I've got erm
B	yeah
C	I've got a figure of eight one as well because you'll often have a figure of eight one you normally have it'll be one or two sometimes three mine are about three of edge ones like down down the sides of the rink and then you'll often have at least one figure of eight one so my figure of eight is my three turns my inside three turns and my outside three turns in a figure of eight and it has to be again five and five so if I do five outside three turns one side five the inside the other
B	yeah
C	it's just it's just kind of displaying the skating basics at each level so to show that yes you can do tricks and yes you can do this and yes you can do that but you can do skating basics as well
B	okay
C	and I'm looking forward to level three level three oh I'm really not actually
A	very good
C	yeah
B	but the elements one wasn't that the one where
C	got confused about the groups
B	got confused about what you had to do? so actually
C	she's still
B	yeah
C	and she got muddled up into another
B	she was so upset wasn't she but?
C	because I spent months and months working on my Salchow to do a free jump and a Salchow months and I didn't do one toe loop and then on the day I did the
B	mm
C	because she'd she'd got muddled up between level one and level two cos level two it's the free jump or the
B	ah
C	she's paid for me to do my redo my test though so I didn't have to pay for it
A	yeah
C	cos she felt really bad but
A	cool
C	yeah yeah bless her
B	she's lovely isn't she
C	she is
B	yep
A	very good
B	mm
B	yeah well the thing is
B	I mean the I'm already
A	yeah
C	do the skating on the floor
B	yeah I did yeah I did that that and then I'm doing the you know so I get all of that and she plays the music she's gonna do
C	yeah
B	and so and yeah so it's quite nice actually that she's when she's talking I know at skating you can talk to people but it's quite nice to talk and you understand and
A	mm
B	yeah so do you think you're gonna get some skates and go back and?
A	it's
B	you've been saying about it for a couple of years or so haven't you?
A	I don't
B	no
A	tests or any competitions probably just
B	no no just
A	this is where my main erm
B	mm
A	lessons again which and I don't think I can do one without the other
C	no
A	I mean there are still dance clubs
C	the only people that I know that do like yeah there's a dance club on a Sunday morning but the problem with that is that they don't really do the patterns and they don't really do the timing they kind of just skate
A	and it's a Sunday morning
C	oh yeah exactly I mean
A	hello
B	yeah
C	the other thing to do I mean is I know people that just have like one lesson a week
A	yeah
C	and they they just do that and they they work on what they wanna work on they don't wanna test they don't wanna do this and the coaches don't push you well some of them do you have to get the right coaches
A	yeah
C	there's a lot of coaches there that will push you and if you don't wanna test them they
C	there are ones that are quite happy just to do it at a pace and
A	don't feel forced to open it if you want to save that for later and and drink the one that you've got open
B	oh I can do
C	I will quite happily drink
B	yeah no that's alright I can
A	whichever you prefer cos I brought that as a a just a general gift for you so you don't have to drink it now
B	oh thank you yeah that's fine well if you're happy with rosé
A	yeah of course yeah
B	I bought that sort of to cook with but it was just one as I wandered through Sainsbury's and I was picking this and that and it was I think it's a almost like a meal deal where you can buy this and this and the wine and it's like a brasserie meal
A	it's really disorientating when you're in a
B	yeah it is yeah I kept walking along thinking I'm sure it's
B	tellys and clothes and and then I sort of spotted fresh fish on I thought oh right yeah so I went there and
C	I don't know yes I do
B	remember I made you a paella?
C	I remember you making me a paella but I don't know what you were doing with it
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	just sneaking it in
B	yeah and cos I do a lot of flavour things with it he's
A	yeah
B	he's actually
B	like it because you never really tried it but actually now you do so I said oh I'll do something with fish and then I thought actually I might make a paella cos I haven't made one before but that'll be nice
A	yeah
B	I know you'd like it and give you food for the next day as well so yeah so I went into the fish counter and I thought right I
B	and he was like really really knowledgeable so I went today and thought yeah I just wanna get some salmon and I knew sort of what I was doing with it anyway but I said to the guy I said oh just out of interest I said what I'm gonna do it in red wine with herbs I said what herbs would you recommend to go with it? he said I dunno I don't really eat a lot of fish
B	I'm like oh right he went yeah I I'm more of a meat eater you know give me a steak any day and I was like
A	that's not helpful
B	okay no that's what I and I don't cos it was next to the meat counter and I don't know whether it was just the time when he was covering both or stuff like that but
A	yeah
B	yeah really like market yeah yeah
C	Tesco's are good at that as well actually cos I
B	mm
C	when I've been there there's a guy who works at the fish counter and he's really really helpful
B	yeah
B	yeah he is actually
B	and I was like yeah and he
A	I've done it before where I've made my own which is quite a good thing actually to just
B	yeah
A	have in the freezer so
C	mm
A	like little sausages of butter that you put herbs and
B	okay
A	so you can do
B	that's a good idea
A	you just
B	yeah
A	so you can have a garlic butter
B	mm
A	and you literally do it in cling film roll it into a sausage
B	mm
A	and then you can slice off slices as you go erm and
B	yeah
A	then just I normally pop some onto the fish in a foil
B	that's a really good idea actually
A	tent
B	yeah
A	and then just oven bake it
A	you can put chillies in
B	yeah
A	you can put herbs
C	mm I did that with a parsley once with cod once where I did parsley
B	mm
C	put it in the
B	yeah
C	tin foil and
A	yeah
B	she said and you've just got it already made and I'm like yeah that's a good idea too
C	or you could just buy the very lazy garlic and
B	could just buy the lazy garlic
A	my erm
B	I remember you doing that
A	he advised doing the freezing of garlic and ginger
B	mm
A	because you can put it in and it doesn't really matter you can put it in frozen it doesn't matter about the water
C	mm
A	cos that just burns off
B	yeah
A	I love tips like that from people
C	do you?
B	yeah
A	I wish people talked about what they cooked more really cos I think
C	it would be useful
A	yeah
B	I like to cook if I've got the time it's it's the same thing really isn't it you know?
A	well
B	cos you can do that from frozen
A	I really struggle at the moment to
B	mm
A	having time to shop and buying
B	yeah
A	too much and wasting food and
B	yeah
A	getting to a point where I don't really have anything in my house so I've actually resorted for the first time in a long time to buying stuff that I'm actually going to able to make into meals so like
C	mm
A	so I've bought some
B	yeah
A	frozen meals for example which I've kind of turned my nose up at a little bit but
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I'd rather do that than end up I often have a loaf of frozen bread and eggs and like have
B	yeah well you can get bread out can't you?
A	poached eggs on toast sometimes four times a week
B	but what what you want to do that means buy extra and cook more and freeze it so when you're making something with chicken make yourself enough
A	yeah
B	for three or four meals and then freeze it in meal portions and then
A	yeah
B	then you pull something out and you just have to defrost it in the morning
A	I do but I'm also away most weekends so I don't even have weekend
C	mm
A	cooking time
B	yeah
A	can't complain my social diary's been
B	yeah
A	the last few months but
B	what've you been doing?
A	just all sorts of bits really and
B	mm
A	making the effort to go and see friends and
B	yeah
A	it's important isn't it?
B	oh yeah yeah definitely definitely is
A	but I've done the quite a lot of worky bits as well so it's been a combination
B	did
A	yeah
B	how did that go?
A	yeah really well the stand looked amazing
B	yeah
A	I got the best of both worlds really cos I was involved at the beginning
B	yeah
A	and got to do all the fun creative bit
C	mm
A	and then I get to hand over just before it started to get all hectic and do the last bits and then I so I just
B	of course yes yeah it was you
A	went on a nice River Thames
B	yeah
A	and then to a posh restaurant and then I went for a couple of hours the next day and then met my friends
A	I do appreciate all these perks that I get
B	oh
A	I'm
B	the thing is you do work very hard
A	it's
B	and what you do really benefits the business so
A	I'd like to think so
B	well yeah it does you
A	oh I have been for
B	ever alright yeah no that's fine well congratulations when you were I'm sure I probably said at the time yeah I'm sure we must've been out for lunch at the time and I must've sort of said
A	well I it happened when I went to the projects team so I got made a senior project manager
B	right
A	and then I got promoted then to commercial projects programme manager
B	right
A	and then when I went back into brand I was obviously a senior project manager so they couldn't make me
B	yeah just a
A	just a brand manager
B	no
A	so I was then a senior
B	yeah
A	and I have been since so I was yeah so for the last eighteen months while I've been back in brand I've been senior
B	yeah
A	nothing
A	well I am getting one er they're reallocating is the thing so I put my order in it was approved
B	uhu yeah yes I remember
A	two weeks after
B	mm mm
A	which is fair enough I do understand it
B	yeah
A	but it's pissed me off
B	yeah
A	erm
B	which I understand
A	much more than I expected it to so it's a really like
B	it's part of your terms and conditions is you get X Y Z and one of those things is that you get
A	a new car every four years
B	a new car every four years yeah exactly
A	and I I've surprised myself with how much it has pissed me off
B	yeah
A	and it so it's a really deep emotional reaction
B	mm
A	because I feel also like I've been loyal to them they're not looking after me
B	yeah
A	and they say that
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	know how it works exactly but basically there's a number of cars and they will try and reallocate them
B	so will they say we suggest this to you? or do they say here's a well here here's a list you can choose you might have four people going for one car mightn't you?
A	I don't really know
B	yeah
A	but I think you you don't have to take any car that you don't want I can opt out at any point
B	that's fair enough
A	erm
B	you can what? oh opt out
A	I can opt out because mine's a benefits car
B	right okay
A	erm but it doesn't really work out better for me I don't want them to know that I could opt out for a little while buy a really cheap car and then opt back in once all the cars have gone
B	yes
A	I don't know how the financial stuff works because obviously I think they match your contribution so that
B	yeah
A	my contribution
B	well obviously not no
A	you have to keep the car till the end of its lease so
B	yeah
A	a lot of them are two years old so I'd have another two years to wait
B	yeah
A	unless I got a high mileage car
B	mm
A	I just want my car that I've chosen and spent four months choosing
B	well yeah it's yeah yeah exactly I mean that's
A	they've completely underestimated how important this is to me
B	yeah
B	what's
A	erm he understands why I'm pissed off and he doesn't want me
B	mm
A	don't make any decisions without coming and talking to me about it
B	yeah
A	erm he says I want to make sure you get the best deal
B	mm that's fair enough
A	I think I would leave over something like this you know?
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't
B	well you've been umming and ahing a bit for a while haven't you on and off?
A	well do you know what?
B	and then better again and then not again and
A	as as soon as I can as soon as I have a weekend free where I can do my CV I'm going to do it and
B	yeah
A	as soon as I've got a CV I'm going to go out for other jobs
B	yeah
A	it's as simple as that and they're not sorting it out
B	it means you can choose whether to take it or not can't you? and
A	yeah
B	why not?
A	erm
B	yeah
A	it's not now the business's choice it's his
A	a financial impact for me
B	yeah
A	just
B	yeah
A	cos I haven't been made redundant doesn't mean that
B	no
A	it's not important
B	no no
A	technically no they'll be they won't be issuing any new company cars until the reallocations have been sorted
B	oh okay oh I see yeah okay
A	in theory I reckon it's probably a grade where that isn't true anymore
B	yes
A	probably got a car
B	yeah which is
A	which is fine and he's a director so I wouldn't expect anything else
B	is that enough couscous?
A	that's lovely yes
B	alright yeah there you go okay
A	thank you where shall we go?
B	if you'd like to take that
A	oh nearly dismounted sideways
B	ah
A	this looks delicious
C	I'm probably a bit fussy
B	that's
C	back off
C	no it's not even
unknown_female	oh my god my
B	I'll get some glasses
A	I feel like a class A plonker every time I talk about it
B	no
A	thank you
B	it's like them saying well you can have a pay cut
A	yeah
A	not gonna pay you next month
B	no this is it and it
A	but I'm staying I'm sticking around to get them out of the crap
B	yeah
A	the crap seems to be getting better
C	I only want a really little bit cos I'm skating tomorrow morning
B	okay
C	lovely thanks
A	erm
B	mm
A	everyone's really drowning with work at the moment so

A	mm
B	mm
A	it lives up to expectations
B	yeah
A	in the taste as well
B	good thank you
A	I'm I really like that idea of couscous with fried with other bits
B	mm
A	love it
B	and you can put spices in or all sorts of stuff depends what you're eating it with
C	mm
B	mm
A	I miss having people to cook for as well because
B	mm
A	it is a bit boring when you're
B	well you can always pop round here on the way home from work a few times if you like
B	mm
A	careful what you er
A	I was thinking when I was looking for the house it was like why have I not been round more often to see
B	mm
B	mm definitely well after the next few weeks please definitely come and see me cos I won't be
A	mm
B	mobile so

A	when you're
A	feeling ready for visitors
B	yeah I will do
A	erm
B	yeah definitely will do
A	then yeah
B	mm
A	so what's the timing on it? when do you go in and?
B	mm well I have to go in on Monday have the op Monday erm they say I should be out on hopefully Wednesday maybe Thursday see how things go erm

A	yeah
B	yeah that is a really good idea
B	I'm gonna have open house on a rota two people a week coming to cook cos
A	mm
B	oh you would've laughed I sat yesterday I thought I'm gonna cook and get stuffed because obviously if
A	mm
B	I got twenty-five of those and I made various spag bols mild chilli so
A	bet you felt like a domestic goddess
B	mm
A	I love it when I have days like that
B	yeah I actually I woke up this morning walked through
B	and there was just that slight like nice smell of cooking yeah not when it's
A	that's a really good idea
B	mm
B	mm
A	yeah you could
B	I should
A	you could mark people
B	basically they've said I can't I can't lift
A	it's not worth it
B	she said everyone says oh you can't lift a kettle these days if you got a light kettle after a couple of weeks you probably could as long as you don't fill it but I've got hot water on my coffee machine so I can do coffee hot water on that
A	Nescafé lift the pod
B	Nescafé? oh the Nespresso yeah
B	yeah although I've got the other one which is erm the ground beans one bean to cup so yeah but I've got plenty of stuff like that
A	yeah
B	potentially again
A	mm
B	even now I'm more positive and yay yay erm because I'm gonna go straight to the end of the menopause again so having gone back into it I'm gonna go right to the end of it
A	mm
B	quite happy to do that so she's gonna basically manage how I am my symptoms and get me to be me who I am
A	mm
B	even if it's a slightly new me erm without doing that hopefully
A	mm
B	erm and HR are saying that's January if if your doctor occupational health whoever say it needs to be February it'll be February but I'm thinking in my mind I should be coming back January
A	mm
B	erm
A	she seems nice what do you think?
B	she she is great yeah really really good mm
A	I've only seen her on a er
B	yeah she is
A	she is really nice
B	mm yeah
A	yeah
B	and she said yeah absolutely she said what you've got to think at the moment is are you up to doing a full interview? coming in presenting doing
A	mm
B	spotted that today so I'm gonna mention that cos I'd seriously like to be in the mix for that
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I can't work out whose job that is
B	well it's probably
A	it's got
B	has it?
A	mm
B	oh even better I don't mean even better cos I don't wanna work for
A	yeah
B	erm but she said essentially we need to be looking at if I'm coming back in January
A	are you looking to move away from
B	mm
A	don't blame you
B	mm
A	yeah of course
B	and they said at the moment we need we need to look at your health and what's happening with this and you need to be off for a long time because of that that that but at the moment we don't wanna start saying oh and when she comes back they said we'll shelve that I know about it
A	you can think about that when you're coming back
B	yeah exactly exactly I did say to
A	mm
B	erm I you know and she was like right so I thought I'm gonna keep that on a so I'm I'm hoping that I'll see occupational health and it'll be managed in the business that I come back doing something different with somebody else and then everyone can be happy can't they?
A	mm
B	mm
C	can we erm I've printed off the criteria for the dep roles
B	okay
B	mm certainly
C	erm I've spoken to
B	right
C	because it's like an internal expression of interest
B	yeah
C	and said oh well you're not trained oh no actually it's because you've got so many weeks booked off holiday in December and they can't make up their mind what the reason is but now all of a sudden she's not allowed to go and do this EO job
B	mm
C	so she's now being trained to be a dep so that when another EO position comes up she will be trained already pretty much
B	mm
C	to be an EO and she'll have a bit of experience of it anyway but then also erm you know she's first on the list basically if an EO role comes available but she'll be given preference for it
B	what does she think about being trained to be a dep?
C	she's not very happy she says
B	no
C	she feels like it's a consolation prize cos she's been
B	mm
C	offered a job as an EO
B	well it'll be different money won't it?
B	mm well a dep's more but an EO would be even more wouldn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	I've helped them by where obviously they're they're struggling in certain areas I've I've given them information I've got and copied it and given it to them she went yeah
B	mm
C	and I went and I've also mentioned like the fact that I often take on more work than other people so like if they're if someone like is missing a
B	yeah
C	it's supposed to go to them I'll go oh I'll take it
B	yeah
C	or like when you know people are going home for the day and I'll go no give it to me seriously give it to me I'll do it
B	yeah
C	to
A	yeah
B	mm that sort of stuff and also the fact that the amount of stuff you put through is a lot more than a lot of other people isn't it?
C	I don't know
C	but last week I got two hundred and
B	mm
C	that was only thirty off the target and we were low on examiners as well so she said that was really good
B	mm
C	oh my erm EQA score's gone back up to ninety-seven point ninety-eight point seven
B	did you ever find out what it was that you were doing that was?
C	I got I had one thing confirmed what it was but erm it was something I didn't even realise you had to do but the others she's still trying to find out
B	mm
C	so I don't know
A	are you still at the
C	mm
A	how are you enjoying it?
C	yeah it's really good I'm I I really like it and
A	mm
C	deputy to a leader role
A	mm
C	that's my boss basically said to me there's one coming up she thinks we'd be good at it she's mentioning it to people that she thinks would benefit from it and did I want these
A	that's really good
C	mm
B	that was good yeah
A	cos it took you long enough to get in after all all the
C	yeah
A	all the hoops that you had to jump through
C	I know it it's
B	mm
C	it's mental but everyone will go through the same thing
A	yeah
C	because it's obviously it's such a
A	mm
C	anybody on our system that you're not supposed to search for you'll get sacked straight away there's no way around it you will just be sacked
A	mm
C	they they're really really strict on like rules and stuff
A	mm
C	like they're real real strict
A	mm
C	you can see why cos it's
A	as soon as you get a passport you have citizenship and that's the gateway to
C	exactly yeah
B	mm
A	a lot of other erm activities
C	things like we we've got to be really careful and and check people have citizenship and like for people's children and stuff you have to make sure that they
A	yeah
C	just being born in the UK doesn't entitle you to be a
A	mm
C	British citizen anymore
A	it's tough
B	when they were talking about doing the Scottish vote that was all everybody where you were working then people were saying
B	mm
C	yeah we're issuing these passports
B	mm
C	to keep issuing them now and?
A	yeah
C	but it was cos
B	because they hadn't made a decision
B	yeah
C	we weren't told any different but
B	yeah if it's issued under the regulations at the time even if the regulations
C	yeah
B	change the next day it was issued right at the time wasn't it?
A	yeah absolutely
C	exactly that's the main point
B	but as you said if if it someone's issued something you have to check whether the parent's born in the UK
C	yeah
B	if they're Scottish then
A	no
B	just
C	it was we were all worried it was gonna be a problem with that actually
B	mm
A	at least it didn't change
C	but it wasn't
C	no exactly I mean it
A	so you've survived a summer now
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	see now we're doing things from like last week or the week before so I don't you know it's all we're
B	mm
C	we're really quiet now
A	apart from just having to get through
C	yeah exactly and they've done a massive shuffle round so no end of people as the rush is like finished have suddenly gone off to different departments because they applied for the roles but the change didn't happen until it would quieten down
A	yeah
C	cos otherwise if you move people that have experience from one area to another and you get people
B	mm
C	from another area that don't know what they're doing you've gotta train them so yes they were hiring staff at that point but they were keeping it regulated whereas
B	mm
C	if you shift all the experienced people off kind of
B	mm mm
A	it's good to know for when you're planning your next move isn't it?
C	shuffle
A	in terms of planning
C	yeah
A	that was delicious thank you very much
B	mm
C	mm
B	thank you I was just thinking I can actually probably eat that every night
B	just with slightly different tweaks of flavours and stuff but it was just
C	I'd probably get fed up if I had it every night
B	but anyway
C	for the record let's just put that put that down there
B	okay
B	no I
A	mm
B	and it's so tasty and when I say I've got a splash of wine with it it just
A	mm
B	just really makes it nice and you can mm anyway
A	I never thought about adding wine to salmon before
B	mm no you do know the rules add wine to everything
A	there's an amazing erm
A	there's an amazing Billington's recipe for
B	mm
A	sticky salmon marinade
B	mm
A	oh I can make that for you one day
B	mm
A	when I'm round I could pop the marinade in in the morning I'll drop by on my way to work and be like right fish is marinating in there
A	and er
B	mm
A	cos that's really tasty
B	yeah? excellent mm
A	I will come and cook for you if that's
B	no no that'll be really nice
A	if it's
B	cos the thing is
A	give you a night off as well
C	mm
B	mm well I mean
A	mm
B	once they start commissioning properly erm
A	yeah might be nice
B	cos it I mean it's only well it's two hours I think to where he is but obviously can't do it all the time but
A	that'll be nice for you as well to
B	mm yeah this is it
A	cos the boredom fight will be the biggest one
B	well this is it I yeah I mean the first couple of weeks
A	you're gonna you're gonna feel crap anyway though aren't you? so it's going to
B	yeah
A	it's different when you're in the when you're in that phase where you feel really poorly and actually you don't want to be moving anywhere
B	the very first little bit
A	sounds amazing
B	no yeah
C	mm I know it's
B	with compression stockings on
C	that's the one thing I'm looking forward to about having er
A	oh sexy
C	having those two days off next week cos I can sleep
B	yeah yeah
B	I'll be ringing you going
B	snooze
A	ten more minutes yeah
C	yeah I'm just waiting for it to be confirmed but it should be
B	yeah
C	fine cos like
B	mm
C	well that's fine but
A	could you do it as compassionate or something?
C	that's what I'm trying to get it as special leave and they're like erm cos
B	no
C	to go and do something I wanna do
B	no
C	not that I don't wanna go tomorrow but you know what I mean I'm not going to
B	no
C	to go out and I'm not going to something fun or just have a day couple of days chilling
A	yeah
C	I'm basically gonna be spending the day looking after my mum and making sure she's got food and making sure
B	that's all yeah that's it so if I wanna have a shower she will be making getting me in and then perching so
C	exactly and like you know for even things like if you wanna go to the
B	this is it yes
B	yeah
C	and get up fine and not have a problem
B	yeah
C	but you could not be able to get up and then I can't
B	mm
C	leave you on the Friday
B	you
C	exactly
A	some kind of makeshift pulley system
B	yeah
C	but I think after like cos if we've got
B	yeah that's right
A	mm
C	by the Monday you'll
A	you'll be in a little routine
C	yeah exactly
B	yeah this is it
A	and you will have worked out
C	and probably
A	no
B	and you can walk back and forwards to the toilet across so
C	yeah exactly
B	I'll be able to do that that's fine
A	mm
B	you know anything else I'm not even gonna worry too much about doing apart from getting up and going to the loo
C	yeah
B	yeah if I want showers that's fine
A	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	but I I started noticing this last couple of weeks I've really started thinking as I'm doing something like I use erm Sanctuary er
A	mm
B	just bend down or I'll have two perching stools and I'll sit on one and have it on
C	have the other
B	but you start thinking of of bits you know what I mean it's?
B	yeah
A	my pamper set up
B	yeah so exactly yeah so I've got all all the tools of the trade there and
A	yeah
B	my my razor cos I'm gonna wanna shave under my arms and
A	cos this'll be what keeps you feeling here and
B	yeah oh god yeah this is it yeah and
B	a
A	a hoover?
B	hair dryer?
A	you'll be able to judge yourself quite quickly what
B	yeah yeah
C	mm yeah
A	what's
B	yeah exactly and that's the thing you've gotta just
A	mm
B	I need to be skiing at Christmas so
A	that's a good incentive isn't it?
B	yeah
A	just five weeks
B	definitely
A	have you got some good books lined up?
B	er yes I've
A	okay
B	and you just
A	that's amazing
B	yeah it's really good
A	BookBub?
B	yes I can erm you
A	yes please do
B	what's erm?
A	erm
B	how
A	if you do it my home one
B	yeah
B	uhu
B	yeah I'll do that cos you invite a friend and
A	ah
B	not that you get anything for doing but it's just it it you know it's a
A	yeah
B	but I was looking thinking like oh no no but that one oh that looks really
A	I've erm started doing on Amazon you know where they on the erm actual book site where they
B	mm
A	recommend if you if you like this
B	yes
A	other other readers have bought this as well
B	mm yeah
A	and they're often connected
B	mm
A	and then if you do I think I normally try and do three or four steps
B	mm
A	so you link in to one of those and then it kind of takes you off on a little journey
B	yeah
A	and then you pick an obscure book
B	yeah
A	and obviously one that's got quite a good rating
B	yes yeah
A	erm but I've read some really good books that way
B	yeah
A	it's quite a good little
B	yeah
A	I'm reading one at the moment called Shadow of the Sun
B	right
A	My African Life it's a
B	mm
A	who's there erm
B	well it was Idi Amin wasn't it and?
A	coup d'états and
B	yeah
A	dictatorships
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	the genocide there and
B	mm
A	just he seemed to have been in touch with a lot of kind of the difficult history bits of Africa
B	right
A	and I hadn't really ever appreciated it or thought a huge amount
B	no
A	about it but
B	mm
A	poor farming and just poverty and erm and even it talked about the slave trade how the period where the colonists were taking large amounts of people out of Africa to
B	yeah
A	begin the slave trade in other countries
B	mm
A	just decimated their population and you never really think about it that way do you? cos you
B	mm
A	know about slave trade and you've heard
B	yeah
A	about that and
B	yeah
A	obviously just having read Gone with the Wind that's an interesting one as well
B	yeah yeah
A	but I never thought about the fact that it was taking away part of the economy of Africa
B	mm
A	and leaving this big hole
B	yeah
A	which has never really been replenished
B	no no
A	and then also creating a lot of the racism stigmas
B	mm
A	that African people feel these
B	mm
A	still feel today and
B	yeah yeah
A	so a lot of like apartheid and things link right back into the roots
B	yeah yeah to that
A	just because
B	yeah yeah
A	but I never really thought about it that way before
B	but
A	which is stupid cos
B	well er the thing is that there's so much that goes on and has gone on in the world that you don't stop and think about loads of different things and whether that's I yeah we all know Rosa Parks sat on a bus and refused to move you know
A	yeah
B	we all know
A	history and where did they come from and?
B	it's like Ruth Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in Britain
A	I don't
B	well a bit like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and that and and not in massive detail but it's something that sparks off
A	oh I'm fascinated by things like that
B	oh yeah
A	crime and punishment history and
B	yeah
A	bit gory stuff but
B	yeah
A	do like it
B	yeah
A	my phone's poorly
B	is it?
A	my er
A	cos it's out of warranty
B	mm
A	it's only eighteen months old
B	alright
A	but it's out of warranty cos they only get a year
B	yeah
A	and it's not something they can fix so it's some replacement phone hundred and eighty-five pounds
B	mm
A	I've only got six months left on my contract so it's not worth it
B	you gonna wait for six?
A	yeah and I've
B	yeah
A	discovered this phone which is the four
B	yeah
A	it's okay so far it's
B	mm
A	blooming slow and the screen looks really small in comparison
B	yeah
C	yeah mine froze the other day it was really weird I was I was literally
A	was that after you threw it down the stairs or?
C	I
B	it's it's funny that
C	erm about a week or two haven't I?
B	mm
C	cos my one I've swapped with my dad
A	oh yeah you just went
B	so was I
A	yeah yeah
B	when the six came out she found she couldn't actually get the new software
A	no I can't
B	so they swapped
C	so erm
B	mm
C	and I put the well I put my pin in and it was like no like definitely right so I put it in again no
B	yeah
C	I'm like they're definitely right then the screen went black and I thought oh god what's happened?
B	what's happened?
A	the screen of death
C	yeah what's happening?
C	and then all of a sudden it
B	yeah
C	came back it was fine again
B	there is erm oh gosh
C	I don't know if there's another update and I haven't done it I think
B	yeah there is
C	it's literally
B	because erm
C	I've left it on my Ipad
C	oh yeah mine's up to date as well
B	mm
A	yes
B	erm it's Dance with a Stranger
A	mm mm
A	I love things like that
B	cos the film with Miranda Richardson I mean everyone thinks of her as in Blackadder and being the comedian but she's an absolutely brilliant actress
A	oh I do love a bit of a period drama as well though
B	yeah yeah yeah and it it was just I really really love the film
A	yeah
B	but yeah so that's
A	cool
B	something you
A	oh good referral I do like things like that
B	mm yeah
A	and I also like going on a little bit of a spiral once
B	yes
A	you've started something
B	yeah
A	I er when I came back from
B	oh yes?
A	which is a bit controversial
B	yeah
A	I think but erm
B	is it a bit heavy?
B	mm
A	erm and that's one of the things that a lot of people say
B	yeah
B	mm
A	erm it fascinates me how he was so enigmatic
B	yeah
A	how he was able to be
B	yes
A	yeah
B	whereas Hitler actually he got the people following him didn't he?
A	and also just how he built some of his ideologies cos
B	mm
A	it doesn't go into it in a huge amount of detail but early on in the book it does talk about his younger years and
B	mm
A	I don't know how far I'll get it's a pretty big book
B	yeah
A	and it's and apparently it's just not very well written so it's
B	mm
A	a bit like persevering with
B	you might find at the start you might actually think and skim read off yeah read quite quickly certain bits and then something'll interest you and you'll read a page or two
A	yeah
B	really in depth
A	but I was interested when I came back from Berlin to read that
B	yeah so what were you in Berlin for?
A	that was last year for my birthday
B	oh that's right with your mum and your auntie
A	yeah
B	and yes I remember all that yeah
A	and er it's just a wounded city
B	mm
A	it's a little bit like erm
B	yeah
A	coming out the other side which is really
B	mm
A	I think it's really encouraging cos hopefully some other countries that at the moment are just ravaged by war
B	yeah
A	hopefully they can get to a point
B	yeah
A	where
B	yeah
A	erm they come out the other side and it's more stable and
B	in in the future mm
A	fifty years down the line because this is within our lifetimes as well that's one of the things
B	yeah
A	that's so
B	oh yeah
A	astounding
B	yeah
A	and then after Hitler the wall and the
B	mm
A	it just is a savaged it was savaged as a
B	mm
A	country
B	mm
A	I just find it fascinating
B	mm
A	history and people's
B	yeah
A	lives I think actually more than
B	yeah
A	history
B	cos I I found that we at school at history we were doing Iron Man you know the iron age one not Iron Man that's a
A	X-Men?
B	erm oh yeah no I I am Iron Man that's erm Black Sabbath isn't it? yeah it's
C	it's also a film
B	it's a music thing yes Iron
A	Iron Maiden were you thinking?
B	Iron Man
A	Iron Man is Robert Downey Junior in
B	I am Iron Man
A	oh
B	no it's a song it's a it's it's a Black Sabbath song
A	oh
A	you were doing that at school?
B	no I I wish we were
A	oh
B	no we were doing all about the Iron Age and
A	right
B	and people's lives what they were like and why things happened and and you didn't I just thought
C	actually I I I was just as interested in history just about things that have happened and stuff
B	mm
C	less less about the actual people involved just more about like the events and stuff
B	yeah
C	cos we went to the Somme grounds and that was really cool
B	I remember you did yeah
A	oh
B	you said that was really powerful wasn't it?
C	yeah it was really good cos like you think about it like
A	mm
C	all those people that died where you're stood that's really
A	mm
C	bizarre but yeah no it was good I mean I like things like that I find that sort of stuff interesting but then I think I
A	mm
C	when you go down that kind of route I like
A	mm
C	talking about that sort of stuff now
A	mm
C	and thinking about that and
A	what's
C	like philosophical thinking and stuff yeah I like I like thinking about all that sort of stuff and like
B	yeah
C	it's good fun
B	mm
C	when I'm talking about the universe and like what's it expanding into if there is nothing? and that's why when what's his name Brian Cox isn't it the the guy that was on the One Show last night?
A	yes
C	erm although he annoys me a little bit what he actually talks about I find it really fascinating and really interesting and I'm like
B	mm
C	the fact that there's there's universe is being created all the time is sort of like the the new theory
B	mm
C	they're being created
B	yeah cos there's nothing there
C	exactly
C	there's nothing there so there's
B	yeah
C	gotta be something there and like I started talking about it to my friends my
B	yeah
C	this
B	mm mm
C	I like all that sort of stuff which
B	yeah
C	most people kind of go
B	I don't
C	ah it makes their brain ache
B	no cos
C	and it makes them scared as well when you start thinking about things like that
A	one of my favourite
C	I dunno
A	facts is that there's more stars in the sky
B	mm
A	than there are grains of sand on every single beach
B	mm
C	mm
A	on every single surface in the
B	in desert yeah
C	cos it's so big isn't it?
B	mm
C	even our universe is so well massive
A	cos you think what
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	then you think actually
B	there's more stars
A	there's more stars
B	I love the fact that
A	I don't know how they prove that or know it
B	yeah need lots of lots of calculations
A	I suppose they they calculate for the Earth
C	what they'd do is they'd look at the the area of where we
B	mm
C	they'd work out how many
A	yeah
C	they know they'd be able to calculate how
B	yeah
C	many stars are say in our Milky Way they'd work out
B	mm
C	for each
A	and the same universe for sand?
B	I I was just gonna say well who do you think counted all the grains of sand?
C	I dunno but they know roughly again like if you've got in a certain square section of sand how many you've got
B	one two three four
C	there's gonna be roughly the same on each one you know many square feet the
A	sixteen fourteen thirteen
C	the beach is
A	eight
C	how many beaches there are in the world how many square feet there are in those beaches and how much there is in one square feet I think
B	yeah what about the Sahara desert?
C	they know how big it is don't they? they're not they know how big the Sahara desert is in square feet so they'll be able to work it out that way
B	yes mm mm
B	in at looking at the world wars yes I'm interested
A	yeah
B	of actually you know the clothes they wore where they built the clothes from how where they worked and what happened and the day-to-day what they ate and
A	mm
B	that I'm really interested in that
A	mm
B	I I mean I go along I'm
B	or whether they'd bought the stuff on the way home from work and whether they got stuff out maybe
B	but but and but I was
A	mm
B	they're
A	maybe you should move into erm consumer insights
B	yeah
A	yeah essentially just
B	wondering if people managed to get the meat out in the morning or whether they're having to do
A	well I'm not sure that's a frequently researched question but erm
A	just in terms of that
A	interest in digging into the whys and you know
B	oh yeah
A	behaviours and
B	that's what I
C	I think that shows it cos I'm the opposite
C	I find it hard to think about other people's lives and the fact
B	yeah
C	cos your life is your life isn't it? and you
B	yeah
C	you forget the people that drive past you in the street I always think I forget they have a life and then that's where I leave it
B	mm
C	I just think I'm not even gonna think about their life
B	yeah
C	cos it'll confuse me
B	yeah
A	I had a really weird I was going through
B	mm
A	I'd
C	mm
A	and I was like I wonder who's had a really good morning
B	yeah
A	I wonder where that person's going and I
B	yeah
A	just literally went into a really weird erm
B	yeah
A	kind of
B	I wonder if someone experienced domestic violence and in this area probably somebody did this morning
A	oh I did go dark
B	didn't you?
A	oh I do go dark
B	you see
C	see cos you go more into their lives whereas you're thinking
B	yeah I'm the lives
C	so you see you're like in the middle but they
A	I stopped after those three questions
C	you're in the middle between us two
A	I'm really dumb I was then like
B	yeah
A	mm sushi
B	yeah I love sushi
A	oh I always do a little start at the er oh
B	sushi bar?
A	Sushi Bento
B	oh Sushi Bento oh right
A	something at
B	where's that
A	it's not called it's called Wasabi Bento I think
B	is it?
A	something
B	Wasabi yeah
A	Wasabi it's on the corner at Kings Cross
B	oh is it?
A	upstairs
B	ah
A	they do little selection pick and mix of
B	mm
A	or they do box sets and they do
B	mm
A	lovely rice meals I had a
B	mm
A	noodle soup with
B	mm
A	dumplings
B	see I never really stop and eat at Kings Cross cos I'm always on the way to somewhere or on the way back from somewhere when we used to go down and watch the rugby they used to have the Cornish pasty stand
A	can't help yourself though cos it smelled amazing
B	ah I know ah it was really lovely yeah yeah but oh no
A	yeah yeah I do
C	so I'm the same when I when I go skating competitions I I cos basically I
B	mm
C	at a
A	that's it that's the journey
B	mm
C	yeah
B	when you see somebody wearing a certain colour eye shadow I wonder did they look and try and that's what they did is it what the mum always wear wore or told them? has somebody told them that they ought to wear that or did they spot it in a magazine or did they go into a shop? and you know and it's like that
C	I don't even look enough to notice the eye shadow
B	but I
A	I bought a new eye shadow the other day
B	did you?
A	yesterday
B	mm
A	treated myself to some MAC
B	mm
A	and a new handbag
C	mm
B	oh I like that
A	mm it was a bit of an emergency purchase cos my black handbag was on a on its last legs and I took it out
B	mm
A	and er and then felt massively embarrassed about it
B	yeah
A	because it's literally falling apart so erm
B	mm
A	ditch and drop
B	mm
A	no I didn't fully ditch it no
B	did you fold it and put it in that handbag?
A	erm so I noticed my handbag was in a dire state on Sunday
B	yeah
A	and I couldn't really I went into er House of Fraser and all the handbags were ridiculously expensive
B	mm
A	more than I wanted to spend cos I'm a bit of a I'm a bit of a ruiner I
B	mm
A	my bags generally I don't know if that's cos I don't
B	mm
A	but if I spent a hundred pounds on my bag would I ruin it any less quickly than my forty pound bag?
C	mm
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	I'm not really
B	but I quite like with bags or
A	I spotted that bag earlier cos I'm in bag buying mode
B	yeah
B	yeah I got this I can't remember
A	I
B	if it's yeah oh yeah look there green nail varnish cos I was doing nail varnish dropped the brush it went down like
A	oh no
B	and I sort of smudged it a bit and thought oh that's but that's now it's my bag it's personal and I always remember putting the green nail varnish on
B	and dropping the brush and yeah
A	my plan is to erm over the next few months treat myself a little bit more
B	yeah
A	and that's never a bad thing is it? erm
B	mm
A	and get to the stage where I'm not just rotating a couple
B	yeah
A	I have enough that I'm not wearing everything out cos I always do it
B	mm
A	it's the way I work
B	yeah you have a few bits and then you wear them wear them wear them then you definitely
A	yeah
B	need to get some more cos they're falling to bits
C	I've got holes in
B	yeah
C	that's my general thing I get them from
B	yeah
C	getting wet feet
B	yeah
C	need new ones
B	yeah
B	would anybody like a little bit of ice cream? Ben and Jenny's
A	yes I

A	thank you very much
C	like in your eye?
B	no
C	you don't have that?
C	it's really bizarre you can you can feel it
B	I'm not gonna ask what it feels like cos obviously if feels like you've got air
C	feels just like it's like pressure because it gets it's like in the eyelid and it's like pressure
B	almost like a ball of water but you know it's not water
C	yeah I think I've sorted it but
A	I feel like I've got a little bit of a
B	you popped your eye?
A	you know when you get a bit of a
B	mm

A	I've had like three or four nights a week for the last few weeks where I've also been doing stuff and
B	yeah
A	or staying late at work when I'm not doing something
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	just need to lie on the sofa for a little while
B	mm
A	but I
B	okay
C	so if you type if you type
A	yeah
C	watch series dot it and then just put something like Grey's Anatomy
B	isn't it L T?
C	no I T
B	is it I T?
A	okay
B	yeah
C	and then just type like Grey's Anatomy in search it's the top one
B	yes
C	cos I then I then favourite the web page with one of the links and then I can find it another time otherwise I can never find the stupid thing
A	watch series
C	dot I T mm
A	and then did you say how do you get it onto your TV from your Ipad? do you have an Apple
B	right so you have you got an Ipad?
A	yes
B	yeah okay Apple TV which is
A	cos
B	yes which one little one or big one? the younger one?
A	er little shorter
B	older?
A	older
B	right yes
B	yeah it makes me laugh when
A	do you know
B	yeah yeah we went skiing together but his dad on Facebook
A	Junior I think is the er
B	yeah Junior and you know
C	I'll find something to put on it
B	yeah
A	right so it says watch episodes free
B	yeah
A	watch full episode
C	if you type in go back go back cos
A	oh in Google?
C	yeah
C	I've got mine going so I can do it on mine
A	amazing right
C	so it's the top link
A	am I doing this the same thing as you?
C	no I'm on
A	no
A	oh so I have managed to get there
C	yeah
A	right
C	so what you then do is click on
C	cheers
A	cheers
B	do you think I can turn the oven off now?
C	probably would be a good idea yes mum
A	yeah
C	so you see
A	oh okay
C	so then you need to like basically find a link that's a good one I mean there's lots of different ones that are good and you click watch here now the one trick I will tell you though is a lot of the time where it says watch now is deceiving it will usually say continue to video or proceed to video
B	yeah
C	it it it isn't gonna watch that it's all it'll do is bring up a pop-up and if it does that that's the wrong thing to click basically
A	yeah
B	you've got things on either side that say watch now watch now and there's one in the middle er the
C	yeah the little one saying
B	you'll find when you start watching one
C	yeah
A	so whereabouts do I click is
C	on where it says click here at that that bit there play now think it says or
A	watch
C	that's it yeah click on that
A	right so I'm going for Mooshare who's ninety-four percent
C	yeah
A	and lots of
C	you probably will still get pop-ups even without doing it because they do but just click out the pop-ups and go back and it'll do it
A	mm this might be a little bit too much for this phone to cope with cos it's outside of er
C	let me show you on mine
A	let me see
B	yeah look if you if right
A	cos
B	Phish Food Caramel Sutra core Cookie Dough
A	mm
B	would you like all of all of them little bit of each or any?
A	erm I'll have a little bit of each please
C	so
A	oh
C	I know this has links cos I've already watched this today
C	erm okay so
A	I think I've watched Dance Moms erm
A	there's a
B	yes
C	so I didn't even remember before oh yeah CloudZilla's a good one if you can get that cos it takes you straight pretty much straight to the link erm so you have to always on the first one it'll come up with this and you click click here to play and this is just basically the the thing this is a good one because it comes straight up with it and you just have to close it but some of them you'll find erm
A	so now that's got a cross through can you not watch that again?
C	yeah you can go on it anytime you want yeah
A	yeah
C	ignore that and you click proceed to video
C	and then that'll do it and that's the same for the majority of them erm if you wanna find a
A	come on
C	it's just being stupid it does
A	erm Suits
C	and it will actually come up with suggestions so as you start typing it'll come up with suggestions so it comes up with Grey's Anatomy because it knows I watch Grey's Anatomy
C	but erm so then you just click on that
A	that's amazing
C	the first episode
A	right
C	the the odd
A	have you watched Suits?
B	no
A	oh
C	the odd one or two
B	that's I'm getting a list of stuff ready for when I've had my op because basically I'm just gonna veg for a couple of weeks and watch everything
A	right
C	yeah the odd one or two you'll find the the first season will not have any links or the second season may not have any links some of them do like I mean toddlers and tiaras
A	mm
C	so then there are other websites you can try but this has been the one that I know kind of tends to work and it has
A	yeah cool
C	it keeps very up to date some of the websites I've used in the past you don't get the link to the series for like three or four weeks after it's been done
B	oh yeah I mean this is good it's on in America and we got it
C	this one literally the next day
B	yeah
C	so like
B	yeah
C	if it's not on there first thing in the morning it's on there in the evening and the other good thing
B	part of the problem is I need to watch Grey's Anatomy and Scandal Friday morning I was like
C	yeah the other good thing is it tells you the air date so this is when this was aired
A	cool
C	and it tells you so you know it
A	mm
C	tells you the episode that it is the name of the episode and when it was aired so you and that's that's in America when it was aired so obviously it'll be different for Britain for when you're up to so you need to know what series you're on in the UK to make sure you don't skip ahead because this UK typically is about at least half a season behind if not a whole season in some cases like CSI I think I get to almost the end of the series when it starts in the UK
A	yeah because on Scandal we're just on
B	season three yeah and I watched
A	on TV
B	yeah and I watched season three online as soon as I'd finished season two which I had to watch online because it disappeared do you remember I started watching it?
A	yes yeah
B	was it that one I saw? it no it was
A	no erm
C	I'm just gonna show you the
A	True Blood
B	yes yeah True Blood True Blood everything's everything's on there
A	did you persevere with True Blood? did it get a bit samey?
B	no it got it got very much the same yeah and I just thought
A	I was so disappointed by the last ever episode
B	were you? what happened in it? tell me
A	er I can't even remember it was that nonsensical erm
B	yeah but yes she had to choose between
C	and Eric
A	well
B	oh yeah no I'm not gonna watch it
A	she had to kill Bill
B	did she?
A	yeah there is yeah
A	she staked him
B	did she?
A	in the heart yeah
B	why did she have to kill him?
A	erm it was what he wanted
B	oh
A	erm he didn't want to
B	what happened to
A	oh
B	turned into nice Eric or nasty Eric when you say fine?
A	Eric's always
B	Eric's
A	little bit nice little bit nasty
B	oh yes
A	Eric
B	yeah but he he had
A	erm
B	that like makeover didn't he? when right towards the beginning
A	mm
B	and he ended up being really nice and
A	when he erm went off and he was ill so they
B	mm
A	did you were you there did you watch up to when they got ill?
B	no
A	oh so there was a virus that came round
A	called hep V erm it was
B	hepatitis vampire little bit yeah
A	yeah the erm
A	somebody poisoned oh the you know the religious woman?
B	oh
C	no it doesn't matter
B	mm
A	erm you know the religious woman?
B	yes
A	she'd ended up with a different kind of vampire-hating cult
B	right
A	and they poisoned
B	mm
A	so there was all these vampire the last series was a bit weird there was loads of vampires wandering around that were killing
B	sneaky
A	humans again
B	right
A	and infecting other vampires with hep V and hep V kills vampires Eric got
B	mm
A	went off
B	oh
A	erm but came back and erm
B	oh
A	Pam
B	mm
A	and erm
B	that was the other thing with it you think how many series can everybody almost die and be
A	so Eric lived in the end yeah
B	almost die and be found and saved yeah
A	the hot wolf died
B	mm yes erm
A	mm
B	right
A	they were living together for the beginning of one series
B	oh right
A	did you know that Sookie and Bill are married in real life?
B	no no see to me that's more interesting
A	mm yeah it does get a bit samey doesn't it?
B	mm I really enjoyed it I liked it when it first started really enjoyed it
A	mm
B	I mean yeah the acting was a bit wooden sometimes and it you know it was a bit laughable sometimes but actually I thought it was a really good idea
A	it did get samey
B	and then it just kept going round in circles with new people being introduced that actually were gonna try and kill them and they were nearly dead and then they weren't and they were saved and yeah
C	have you got the sound working on that?
B	on which?
C	the recording thing
B	mm
C	this one
B	mm
A	she should definitely have chosen hot Eric
B	mm
A	especially when he went nice
B	I could see yeah I could see why she would
A	she loved Bill
B	particularly in that very first bit when he was so he was vulnerable in bits and then as the story got more and more involved and you start thinking well actually it who's what was it with the queen or then he's with the king or was it with this and why was he doing it what about the?
A	oh Bill became the grand king as well vampire
B	he was
A	mm
B	and when he was
B	that's not my Bill
B	mm
A	mm
B	I've got a very nice man who basically has got it all set up so I don't know what you do with that but it that should be easy enough to find out but then once you've got it you just press your button you have a little remote control puts it on Apple TV which can have your it has all various things on you can then put erm
A	mm
B	stuff like that and then you start playing your whatever you're playing
C	so
A	so what's it linked to at the moment? your Ipad?
B	that's
B	that's just Apple TV
C	that's a screensaver
B	that's a
C	so what you do is there's the button here which is like the little TV with an arrow
A	uhu
C	you press that and then you do it on to Apple TV and then you press play
B	and it's there
A	so where's this playing from? yours?
C	mm
B	yeah well done
A	mm
B	it's my favourite song at the minute
A	it's very good
B	yeah so definitely Apple TV
A	I think Apple TV's like a little box
B	mm
A	that you just do you pay a subscription or just buy it?
B	no no you just buy it plug it in then it link your thingies to it
C	cos you can buy movies to watch it or to rent like
A	because the only
B	mm
A	reason I didn't go for it because I thought it was exactly the same really as having Sky On Demand
B	mm
A	and it almost is but actually if you think of it
B	think there's there's films and bits and stuff I think but we don't ever use any of that side but you could even get so if you're doing stuff on the internet you can sit and actually have it with a keyboard and have it going up onto that so you could actually be sitting
B	yeah
A	oh
C	so like if you do the scrolling up a bit and then Apple TV here
A	mm
C	you can mirror it
A	mm
A	mm
C	I don't really know what they decided but then
A	so is this just from is this just from Youtube?
C	Youtube yeah
A	oh but you don't get any of the like Youtubey crap around it?
C	not unless you finish the video cos I
B	oh er
B	oh yeah yeah look oh
C	erm
B	yeah
C	if when I go off this video it won't be on there but if I do mirroring it will be and you can actually scroll down and pick it what is it?
B	sorry
C	you've not seen this video yet have you?
B	no
C	so this is
A	mm
B	I like
A	I think she's shown she's like got quite a good sense of humour where
B	yeah exactly
C	well done
A	my sister does cheerleading as her sport
B	does she?
A	mm
B	how long's she been doing that?
A	she did it at university and she's now in a a London squad called
A	erm
B	yeah? do they sort of cheerlead at things as well or is it just the sport of against each other the other cheerleaders?
A	no it's the sport so it's kind of erm
B	mm
A	erm
B	right
A	so she catches head end
B	mm yeah
A	of the person that they chuck up she
B	mm
A	catches them
B	wow
A	she loves it
B	mm
A	they do wear erm bows and curl their hair and stuff as well
C	like that erm cheer squad or whatever it is there's a TV programme isn't there where?
A	a bit like Dance Moms
C	yeah but like cheerleaders
A	like cheerleaders
C	yeah
C	I watch lots of trashy American TV okay?
B	I know you do that's your relaxation
C	I like
A	do you like Honey Boo Boo?
C	I haven't watched it only cos I've watched one episode and the mum annoyed me that much I couldn't watch it so I'm I'm gonna have to try it cos loads of people said it's really good if you can get past the mum but like
B	I actually saw one er just flicked on and it was partly er just started so I watched it and that
A	is that my one?
B	yes
A	yeah so you've switched
B	mm yes
C	so like now it's not gonna show it I'll get it on mirroring and I'll show you that one
A	mm mm the erm
B	so yeah Apple TV is the way to go
A	having watched a few of the Honey Boo things
B	do you want a little bit more?
A	no I'm alright cos I'm driving
B	okay sure yeah
A	the erm
C	there you go so now it's like that and
A	oh okay cool
B	are you?
A	on er Apple TV
B	yep
A	erm
B	oh Honey Boo Boo
A	yeah and
B	yeah
A	and I've just
B	I wondered what we were on about
A	yeah
B	but you said she's got the head end
A	oh yeah oh well they're the cheerleaders they're disgusting
B	get it
A	erm but
B	mm yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	the mother always
B	yeah
A	puts a lot of emphasis on them being together as a family and
B	yeah
A	the mother is only something horrendous like thirty-four
A	she's not she's like only a few years older than me and
B	wow
A	erm has this brood of
B	yeah I think the one I saw she was trying to I think the kids were all over the place and so the Honey Boo Boo got up early and made breakfast and all these pancakes and bits and stuff and then went and got
A	yeah
B	and I sort of thought oh bless you know and it yeah
C	yeah
A	you see what I mean about the underlying
C	it's
B	yeah
C	her teeth
B	what's wrong with her teeth?
A	really?
C	they're just awful and like I dunno I don't know what it is I think she just she's mildly off-putting and that's I think what I really struggle
B	mm
C	gotta try and watch it I think cos I think it it is funny and lots of people have said it's really good but I just think I watched one episode where they were being really disgusting and she was being disgusting and then her teeth were really bad and
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and I think it was Christmas or
A	it's all a bit chaotic
B	and they were gonna do some sort of charades sort of charades or something and it was all
A	yeah
A	I don't think it's
C	you are actually addicted when you're off that's the thing and I got addicted to Toddlers and Tiaras when I was off
B	mm
C	and Cake Boss
A	I think Jeremy Kyle makes you feel better about your life
B	mm
C	it does yeah you watch it and you suddenly feel amazing like I'm glad that's not me
B	you seen this poor little bugger she's going
C	sometimes you're rooting for them aren't you though? like
B	yeah
C	you really hope that they're the dad or whatever and other times you're like
B	yeah but like I've stood there a few times and I'm
C	but I actually had to ring
B	uhu
C	it didn't tape
B	that was with your ankle yeah
C	and I and I wanted to know whether or not it was the dad so I rang and she was oh yes and he was the dad
C	and she told me all the information I was like thank you very much
C	but I got proper addicted to it that's what it's it's sad what you get addicted to when you're off I'm afraid mum you'll find this
B	mm
A	that's an amazing apple sorry to interrupt
C	actually yeah I've been looking at that
B	it is actually isn't it?
A	just that
B	yeah
A	one strip of
B	yeah
C	I'm having it tomorrow
B	mm yeah
A	it deserves to be eaten
B	take it tomorrow show it to everybody at work and then eat it
C	I'll eat it first thing in the morning
B	and I bet when you eat it you'll bite the stripe first
C	I dunno I probably won't now cos you told me to
B	oh okay
B	but you would've done
C	no I'm joking but I I dunno I'll by by tomorrow morning I'll've probably forgotten in all honesty
B	yeah
C	but if I take that apple it'll be great and if I don't then it'll get eaten at some point
A	like ah I forgot the stripy apple
B	you'll come home tomorrow like I forgot that
A	yeah
B	where's it gone?
A	gave up your rights to the stripy apple
A	when you ditched it in the morning
B	well
A	erm so I did something quite fun a couple of weeks ago
B	mm
A	I learned how to ride a moped
B	mm did you?
A	yeah
B	did you go on a CBT thing
A	yeah
B	or something really?
A	yeah
B	that's not erm still is his new
A	well it wasn't him but
B	oh
A	erm
B	mm
A	it was separate to that it's because
B	right
A	so I rode on the back of
B	mm yeah
A	erm but just didn't get out this year so
B	mm
A	I don't like being reliant on
B	yeah
A	him to take me out
B	yeah
A	cos it's hard cos he's
B	mm
A	got to walk and it's as his life he's not the most planned person so
B	no
A	erm I was like right well I will learn to ride myself
B	yeah
A	and then I can go out whenever I want
B	mm
A	so
B	so are you gonna you gonna get a moped or get a motorbike you're gonna do your you've done your CBT then?
A	right so
B	mm
A	I think I'm gonna get my licence though
B	yeah
A	so I might get a little moped in between I
B	mm
A	quite fancy one of the little stylish Vespas or
B	yeah
A	a Lambretta or something
B	yeah
A	erm just because of throttle control and balance and I think it'll make me a better rider
B	yeah
A	longer term if I
B	yeah yeah
A	go a bit steady
B	yeah
A	and then learn how to do it
B	my friend's just done
A	mm
B	she for the last sort of two years she did her CBT and then she got a little bike and then she was riding that and then she's got now a bigger bike and yeah she's passed her full test and she's put on Facebook where I remember it's something like
A	yeah yeah
B	and just like one of these things and she's on that as well and yeah
A	I just quite like them it's just a bit of a random thing
B	years ago I was going to I was really interested going to do it and
C	I wasn't allowed
B	and I just
A	mm
B	and I just sort of said okay and and I thought no I'm not you know what I mean I
A	mm
B	have done on and off
C	you guys
B	did I?
C	because of
B	oh
B	in front of cars out the way of cars it but
B	or
A	yeah
B	I
B	but we didn't say you couldn't did we?
C	yeah you did
B	did we?
C	you basically said
C	that well you know what
B	yeah
C	well well well well well we don't really know and I'm just like fine whatever I won't do it
B	reminds me of
C	that was when I worked at the bike it was
B	yeah
C	and you were like well you know
B	yeah cos I I wouldn't've said not
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but but yeah
C	cos basically
B	well
A	I think ultimately I enjoy riding on the back more than I will riding myself cos I don't think I really
B	yeah cos you're cos you were gonna go places whereas when you were on the back they go flat out and you just you trust them so you just think yeah
C	although I
A	I
C	nearly fell off the back once cos
B	you are meant to hold on all the time and be ready for all eventualities
C	I was holding on to the to the end to the back seat bit
C	erm cos we were it was when the roadworks were on in
B	yeah
A	erm I I think I'd
B	mm
A	myself but I think it's gonna take a while to get there
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	bit random
B	yeah
A	one of those things
B	we used to go well I mean years ago we used to go out with
A	yeah
B	almost forgot I was there I know he was doing once going over and he was wheeling and doing stuff with me on the back
B	and then he was going driving along there was a back road
C	hypocrite
A	mm
B	and he was I know he was he was bouncing and bouncing and I actually had one at the front and one back because it was such a bouncy road and at one point I went and he had me on the bike was actually
A	ah
B	when we stopped his mates were behind him going blooming hell
A	oh it's just
A	a brilliant thrill isn't it?
B	oh it is
A	so I might just
B	mm
A	I need to just get a few people that I trust I think that
B	yeah
A	I want to ride with
C	it's not so fun
B	mm
C	on a really hot day though cos the helmets are so hot and you take it off and you're like
B	mm
C	for air
A	there's a guy in
B	mm
A	erm he's fifty he occasionally sends me weird Facebook messages
B	okay
A	it's like do you fancy going for a coffee? it's like I don't know if he's being friendly or friendly and then
A	erm
B	friendly or friendly
A	and then at one point he'd went through all of my back Facebook pictures and liked various ones
A	but I don't know if he just is kind of like that and he's like oh Facebook I'm really excited about it and
B	a bit picky yeah yeah
A	not really you know sometimes people can be so innocent about something
B	yes I know what you mean
A	that he wouldn't even assume that that was what I thought because
B	yeah
A	but he is
C	it's like when people poke you now it's like who pokes? no one pokes any more
B	no one pokes any more
C	why are you poking me?
B	yeah
C	I never poked when they poked when people did poking I didn't
B	no I didn't
B	no
C	I didn't see the point because it's a never-ending battle no one can win there's no points there's no winners or losers and I find that pointless
A	a bit of a flirtatious
B	mm
A	poke now and then?
C	poke
C	so I've got people that have poked me and I'm like I'm not poking back
B	no
C	I never poke anyone back
B	yeah just send me a message and say what you've gotta say and just
A	yeah after the erm
B	mm
A	this guy from I think he's from
B	oh right
A	don't even remember talking to him but I have quite a lot of memory loss from my wine
B	do you?
A	yeah
A	I had a real bad
B	was it a good night? what did they do in the evening then? was it a barbecue was it?
A	barbecue
B	yeah
A	and we had the Billington's photo booth which was quite good fun
B	oh I saw some of those on Facebook
A	and then some and then just free drinks as well
B	mm
A	erm
C	free drinks is never good
A	I had awful beer fear the next day not helped by
A	and er
B	did they pay for the taxis?
A	yeah
B	yeah oh that's good so they
A	but I was like what did I do to deserve?
B	yeah
A	oh shit I think I've just confirmed it
A	no I haven't
B	phew
A	erm
B	let me see
A	what did I do to
B	if you
A	oh
B	I was gonna say if you're gonna go on the wifi
A	oh cool
B	you can't print on it there's certain things but
C	you can't do Apple TV on it
B	you can't do Apple TV on it
C	cos mum's found out and she's like why's it not working?
A	who is
A	oh

C	yeah
A	because there's nowhere in my house at the moment
B	it's lovely and large up there isn't it if I remember yeah?
A	yeah there's nowhere in my house at the moment that I really feel comfortable sitting

B	mm

C	oh
B	and we brought sombreros and moustaches and and stuff that yeah
A	I've got moustaches for the guests
B	we've got all that stuff so then we were like
A	I'm getting
B	cracking night
A	I've gone a bit over the top cos we've started to do these round the world dinner parties which are brilliant it's a brilliant idea and erm
B	mm oh yeah
A	so the first one I did was Portugal
B	mm
A	and then we've had France Greece Lebanon was the last one and then I'm
B	mm
A	doing Mexico so
B	yeah
A	erm it's just four of us still so it's really low-key but
B	mm
A	only the
B	can if they want but not yeah
A	so it was
B	yeah
A	really nice cos you know you have
B	yeah
A	extra effort but
B	yeah yeah
A	if you're going to a dinner party
B	yeah
A	you don't always want to
B	you can or you're not or yeah rather than oh I've got to find a so-and-so and a so-and-so you could do it as little or as much as you want can't you?
A	yeah
B	oh that's nice
A	so for my Portuguese I did a I did a quiz
B	so who are you
A	er so it's
B	okay yeah
A	and er and baby
B	well obviously
A	erm I did a a quiz for my Spanish night er for my Portuguese night Spanish or Portuguese so I had lots of people that were famous
B	mm oh right
A	and they were
B	that's a good idea actually for a really simple quiz
C	mm
A	it was simple
B	to get yeah
A	Tom Hanks
B	mm
A	Spanish or Portuguese?
B	Portuguese
A	did you know that or did you guess that?
B	no no I don't I just totally guessed because
C	I'm gonna go with her on that one
B	I would never have thought he was Spanish
A	or Portuguese
B	but Portuguese is more they don't look as Spanish
A	I know what you mean
B	Spanish have got more of the
A	I think it's Tom Hanks's grandmother that's Portuguese or something like that
A	erm tenuous link
A	yeah and I downloaded the er
A	I downloaded the national anthem and it comes on my Iplayer every so often when I'm in the car like

A	jazzy waistcoat
B	yeah

A	egg custard tarts
C	I'm just gonna
B	yeah
C	you know all these people are coming into
B	oh right
C	and I went and no I'm not
B	but you you can
unknown_female	do
C	erm will I now
A	what's the Deal or No Deal cake?
B	oh
B	oh she's a lovely girl
B	a bit of
C	she she's like she's stupid she should've dealt
B	yeah
C	she's foolish cos she didn't deal silly girl silly girl
C	and then when they get the two hundred and fifty thousand she's like oh wow they
B	yeah
C	you just said they should've dealt and they wouldn't've got that
B	oh yeah he does really does
C	like you said she's like well but yeah but you would've dealt and you wouldn't've got the two hundred
B	yeah
C	and fifty thousand pounds well you know I would've been happy with that yeah oh well but you would've had it and then you'd've been sad and no I'm
B	it's the it's yeah I mean I sit in the office with music playing here she's watching it in the front room and I can hear her going bugger me
B	stupid man and I'm going what? Pardon?
B	nothing just watching Deal or No Deal right yeah right
B	just she's so funny
A	do you see
C	bleeding hobo
B	erm
A	I thought you were gonna say food
B	no no no no
A	when you meet at the kitchen you'll be like he gets his
B	he
C	he just walks in and opens the fridge and like
B	and he'd be like no no I've moved out and I'm not gonna be one of these people that's moved out and comes over to eat with their mum every week and I thought oh that's fair enough but as time's gone it's a year now since he's gone erm
A	I can't believe it's that long
B	yeah
A	not five
B	yeah it's a year so now yeah he comes in and we just we've always said to him you know help yourself when you're here so he comes in now and opens the fridge and goes you got no food and I say
C	it's normally by about this time isn't it that we haven't got any food?
B	mm yeah
C	cos
B	she does yeah she does
C	and we don't have any food
A	ah I never have food in my house I
B	doesn't make you a bad person does it?
C	if I move out it'll probably be similar to that because I'll have like certain staple
B	mm
C	things but then I'll probably just be like pop to Tesco's on my lunch break get what I want for my tea
B	yeah that's it
A	do you know what though? it's so expensive
C	I'm just not very organised
A	I find it
B	mm
C	not very organised
A	it's such an expensive way to do it cos if I'm going
B	mm
A	and Waitrose is my quick on the way back home
B	yeah
A	shop as well so
B	mm
A	that helps you spend more money too
B	yeah
A	and er so I end up spending maybe dunno thirty pounds here forty pounds there
B	yeah yeah well that's it
A	so I'm spending uncontrolled amounts
C	see I'm pretty good at walking in getting what I want and
B	yeah
C	walking out
B	but that's why you you seriously need to when you're getting something to make you know it's lovely
B	isn't it yeah? I'll bring and this Rimmel sixty second stuff that dries really quickly and I've just been going on on Amazon like going oh another colour another colour another colour oh I love it erm
A	anyway sorry
B	so yeah that's that's why you seriously need to get into your oh I'm gonna buy
A	yes
B	make something are there right and make enough for three meals and then bag it
A	yeah
B	and freeze it
A	cos then I'm not wasting stuff as well
B	and then you
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I really struggle cos my my weeks are just
C	I can imagine
A	I can't complain
B	no no
A	I'm fine eating poached eggs on toast
B	yeah well it's good it's fine
A	it's just
B	yeah it's good for you
A	not every day
B	well yeah no no
A	it's er
B	so erm tell me about
A	Paris?
B	Paris yeah
A	so erm I had a really nice trip overall so
B	yeah
A	that I
B	that's good yeah
A	so ended going the Tuesday and
B	mm
A	on the Tuesday evening
B	yeah
A	and then erm
B	mm
A	morning together and then I met up I moved hotels and then erm met up with
B	mm
A	how much have I told you about him already so?
B	just that you sort of met him were sort of vaguely introduced as in you two are gonna get on really well and you got on really well and there was a bit of emailing and stuff like that and
A	yeah so beforehand and
B	yeah
A	er we met up and we had a fab evening
B	mm
A	erm so we just went round Paris really so erm went to the Louvre for a little bit if we ever did get together properly it would be
B	mm
A	an amazing first date story
B	yeah
A	so we went to the Louvre
B	yeah
A	erm just really low-key not doing anything we weren't trying to
B	mm
A	be pretentious we'd already discussed our views on art that it was
B	no
A	to be enjoyed rather than to be
B	yeah yeah
A	overly studied or anything like that
B	yeah yeah
A	so we weren't kind of
B	whereas I'd be wondering about what the person was wearing when they painted it and if they had a sandwich next to them to eat and pick at while they were painting it
B	or whether somebody was gonna bring yeah exactly whether somebody was gonna bring something in for them so yeah okay yeah
B	seriously I would I mean
A	yes
B	that's the level it goes to
A	but it was at a
B	mm
A	this one room it was like oh they couldn't really be arsed with this ceiling could they?
A	so it was literally on that level
B	yeah
A	of erm
B	yeah
A	of
B	mm
A	I managed to do a Marilyn erm Marilyn Monroe?
B	yes oh did you? excellent mm
A	that was a bit embarrassing and then I did it again shortly afterwards
A	he was hanging back a bit erm
A	and then we went to I my brief to him was take me to the places that I wouldn't
B	yeah
A	erm I like to see cities at night so
B	mm
A	I want to see kind of a little
B	mm
A	it's a bit weird maybe he's going to the loo or something so carried on walking
B	mm
A	I'm obviously supposed to follow him
B	mm
A	don't really understand this and then it opens up into this little cool er cocktail bar
B	oh right
A	and so cocktails there and then we went
B	mm
A	one of the street cafés so we were eating outside bit of al fresco dining
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	erm quite a residentially area you could just tell it was one of those it wasn't quite kind of in the mainstream things but it was
B	yeah
A	a local place that
B	yeah
A	it was really busy
B	yeah good place you can go to yeah yeah
A	erm oh that was the first time that I've had a really bad craving since I got out of my craving stage
B	yeah cigarettes
A	cos they were all smoking
B	yeah yeah
A	in the streets and thankfully he didn't cos that would've probably tipped me over
B	oh yeah you've not gone for I'll just have one yeah no well done anyway that's
A	yeah
B	that's really good
A	I'm at eight months
B	yeah
A	now
B	now
A	which is amazing
B	yeah
A	I never thought I'd get here but
B	yeah
A	I am and erm
B	so another couple of months or so and it'll be a year won't it?
A	well I think I'm kind of there I think it's kind of done now
B	yeah well I think yeah that's it that that's a good erm milestone though isn't it but?
A	and after the other night when I couldn't remember I was like oh I hope I didn't smoke
B	oh yeah
A	cos that would've been awful
B	smelling your clothes
A	I could tell straight away that I hadn't but I was
B	yeah cos your your throat would be awful now if you did have a cigarette it'd be
A	but I just thought oh I hope I didn't
B	yeah
A	cos that would be an awful way to fall off the wagon
B	no yeah yeah yeah
A	I was like if I can't remember did it count?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	if that had happened on a one night if it ever did which I'm sure it wouldn't but if it ever did I think if you were then to go that's it and just
A	yeah or I wouldn't beat myself up about it I'd just be kind of
B	or you wouldn't
A	yeah absolutely and er
A	no it is yeah
B	yeah it is isn't it? you just think
A	and you can just go oh I'm not
B	yeah
A	I'm
B	yeah
A	erm but you could almost even laugh about it to people go oh
B	yeah exactly
B	yeah yeah
A	technically eight months but I did have a
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm so then we went to a rooftop bar so we it was an amazing view across the city
B	mm
A	oh we started on a little in a little pop-up area that it's not there during the winter it's only there kind of for the touristy months
B	uhu
A	and er outside bars and restaurants little
B	mm
A	street food type thing
B	yeah
A	right by the river and then er so after the rooftop bar we walked past Notre Dame which was all lit up and amazing and then across the river and then walked about a mile along the river
B	mm
A	to where my hotel was and then parted ways
B	yeah and if you didn't hit if off you could sort of yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	so he knew I was gonna be staying around and
B	yeah
A	we'd talked about it a bit on the evening like my plans for the next day and he made me some recommendations and things
B	mm
A	but erm yeah it wasn't discussed until that point where
B	mm
A	he said well if you've not got anything else
B	mm
A	I'm in a foreign
B	yeah yeah
A	so erm
B	yes
A	I'll I'll sacrifice dinner by myself to come and see you
B	yeah
A	and but it was just erm the conversation was really easy and it was
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	he's very like
B	yes
A	he's friends with the same kind of people that I'm friends with and
B	yeah
A	we move in similar circles and
B	mm
A	erm interesting guy travels quite a lot
B	mm
A	he's he's got a very strange Franglish cos he obviously speaks to French people all day in English broken
B	yes
A	English he's now got quite broken English himself
B	okay
A	erm in a weird way erm
B	yes
A	from
B	mm
A	a flat next to the Eiffel Tower
B	okay
A	he can see the Eiffel Tower out of his lounge window and he's got one of those amazing if I say it's one of the highest ceilinged converted apartments in you know you get in European
B	yes
A	loads of buildings
B	yeah
A	that are just converted into
B	yeah yeah
A	erm maintained flats he lives
B	yeah
A	in one of those and it's
A	just nicely decked out
B	yeah
A	he has his own furniture so he's got good taste
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	doesn't quite so from a match point of view got on really well and actually
B	yeah
A	if he was local
B	mm
A	then there would absolutely be I think something more
B	yeah
A	and we have kept in touch
B	mm
A	it's kind of starting to wane a little bit now
B	yeah
A	erm but
B	yeah
A	cos I do not need
B	yeah
A	weekend relationship
B	no no that's right no that's right
A	and I was thinking about the practicalities of it and yes I could go on the
B	mm mm
A	could do the reverse but how knackering though
B	yeah and long term it yeah it's and I think as well if you look back and think well there's been relationships that haven't been right even though some bits were very good there's been this and this and they've
A	but he ticks all of my boxes
B	yeah
A	just not location-wise which is a big thing
B	yeah that's what I mean it's a it's a big thing that isn't right to start with so
A	yeah
B	yeah keep in touch with him see him again
A	but then part of me says I'm not there's not people like that
B	mm
A	that I get on with that well
B	yeah
A	coming all the time so
B	yeah
A	we'll see
B	if you say if you're emailing keeping in touch but it's waning a bit
A	yeah
B	is that why is that because you?
A	we're just both busy I think and
B	mm
A	there's only so much that you can
B	yeah
A	you can say really I think
B	can say yeah so it's either a case that fairly soon you're gonna have to say
A	yeah so
B	yeah
A	so I've already invited him but erm
B	yeah
A	and I'm going back in
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah so
A	we'll see do you know I'm
B	mm
A	not kind of we're I think without having said anything we're in exactly the same
B	yeah
A	place so we haven't
B	yeah
A	I wanted to take it
B	yeah
A	there without it kind of
B	no no no I know what you mean cos it could've been a really lovely weekend that ended up you ended up in bed together and that was great and and then still you're in the same position now and it's gone a stage further than being friends and getting
A	there's no yeah there's no we don't have any kind of
A	we
B	no
A	there's no kind of
B	no no yeah so you're both in the same place
A	so I can go to Paris and stay in his flat for free
B	right
B	yeah
B	yeah so
B	well that's nice
A	cos he did say afterwards he was like you know you can always stay I'm sorry I didn't say before and I was like but you didn't know me
B	mm no well that's right and if he'd said that in the first place you'd've been a bit wow and
A	so it's quite I'm not surprised that he didn't it would've been weird
B	yeah no that's right no that's right so
A	he's very nice
B	yeah
A	gentlemanly
B	mm so is he definitely Paris long term or?
A	for the next three years but then he's probably in Aberdeen afterwards which is almost worse
B	oh yeah no
A	cos his job is he's a structural erm no he's not structural at all he's a surveyor
B	mm
A	and he specialises in sinking large things into water
B	okay
A	hence why he works for an oil company
B	yes
A	so he sinks oil rigs basically
B	yeah
A	and surveys the land
B	or sinks the bits of oil rigs that want sinking not the whole thing
A	well he works out where they're gonna be sunk
B	right
A	he doesn't do the physical sinking
A	he just looks at the land underneath and says you can sink
B	yeah
A	it here
B	yeah
A	because the structure of the earth is right and you need to
B	mm
A	anchor it in such a way that
B	yeah
A	it stays
B	yeah
A	sound so
B	mm
A	it's quite a cool job isn't it?
B	sounds like the sort of programme
C	do you have to go into a submarine to do that? or does he just know?
A	erm I think he has
A	a computer program
B	yeah go down with like a a prong thing put it on like no mm ding ding yeah
A	I think it sounds more
A	sonar
C	yeah
A	but he goes out to Nigeria and places like that so he's obviously
B	mm
A	on
B	yeah
A	fine I think it's quite a cool job
B	yeah
C	mm it does sound
A	you know what I think a lot of it is
B	he probably does loads of calculations and looks at
C	mm
A	I think a lot of it's geeky kind of
B	yeah
A	computer program work and I think it
B	yeah
A	but so he's a nice guy so it's made me think
B	there are some nice ones that would yeah that tick all the boxes and that's the thing that's what you've gotta do really is that sorry
A	I am a little bit
B	like a little bit of a
B	no she's not it just
A	yeah or just a relationship yeah
B	you just want a relationship
A	just anyone yeah
A	who?
A	oh
B	from
A	no
B	no
B	no
A	no
B	anyway exactly but
A	sorry
B	but it has to be right doesn't it? that's the
A	yeah
B	point you know you can have a long time in a relationship that was right on lots of levels but wasn't quite right for certain reasons and kept trying and trying and then when you weren't with him it was almost
A	yeah
B	but it is so good and so right and then when you're with him it's but this isn't right this isn't right
A	so wrong
B	well yeah yeah and it and that's fair
A	yeah
B	when it was obvious it wasn't going to it was a case of no
A	yeah
B	boxes apart from the fact that they're
A	I didn't find why he's not in a relationship though
B	emotional or something
A	I think it's cos he's
B	mm
A	but anyway not quite right I need a nice
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	for impromptu nights out that's what I want
B	mm
C	yeah
B	are they
B	do you go there?
A	not often
B	no well you ought to
A	so this is the thing I've started to
C	mm
B	mm
A	all my friends have started to be oh let's have a night in and I do like nights in
B	yeah
A	but
B	mm
A	like nights out as well
B	well when I'm better we'll go to
B	when erm yeah we do and I'll be round with
A	we don't have to just go
B	I'll be there with a a notepad and pen
C	oh
B	take notes and go and talk to people
B	well yeah yeah
B	what was that when you met that guy and you went out and had a meal and he was a nice guy but nothing
A	too posh for me?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	lots of
A	well he also mentioned in a weird way a woman and I was it just set all sorts of random flares going
B	he did what?
A	he said he mentioned a woman
B	oh I
A	that erm
B	yeah
A	would be upset if she knew that he was out on a date
A	erm
B	yeah
A	he's like I've got to level with you and no you don't have to level with me on a first date
B	no no
C	you don't have to worry though because if you're not bothered by what she thinks then you shouldn't be
B	yeah
C	she can think what she thinks
A	oh good we're having this conversation so I have
A	oh complicated ex story that's a good one
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	for a drink we're only
B	yeah no exactly yeah your first the first
A	cos he'd been really poorly as well and
B	yeah
A	that was like
B	yeah
A	but actually no
A	not mega rich
B	mm
A	cos he was like I've not worked for seven years
A	he used to be a lawyer in Hong Kong
B	and you're like yeah
A	and he told told me about all his boats and
B	mm
A	motorbikes and like you don't really look like that but well let's go for it and see
B	yeah yeah
A	could be interesting but he
B	mm yeah
A	not rich
A	not that I'm bothered about rich
A	yeah
B	okay
A	but that's okay erm and I hope he doesn't think that I didn't get back in touch because of the illness
B	mm
A	it was just the woman
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	what
B	yeah he's a bit of a strange er so particularly on the first date cos he didn't even at that point necessarily be knowing whether you or he you're interested now in a second date so it's maybe a second date sort of just
A	he had a really it was a really good awkward conversation moment where he was er
B	mm
A	he was like I don't normally do this I don't normally go out on dates with people but obviously there was an attraction to you and I was like
B	mm
A	you see I need to level with you because
B	oh dear dear me
A	there's a woman who er
A	he was forty-four as well so he was
B	mm
A	I would
B	older than you let's just
A	I'd go there but upper bracket like
B	mm
A	just in terms of
B	was it I was stopping you before you said old because otherwise that would've been a
A	yeah I
B	yeah no I know you weren't but that's what
A	upper bracket because
B	yeah
A	because then you get into a different
B	yeah
A	realm of
B	mm
A	life
B	yeah
A	goals and things don't you?
B	mm
A	but erm
B	but then he hasn't got in touch with you either so
A	but I think he left it so I would get in touch with him if I liked him
B	yeah but er
A	but
B	you don't really wanna send a message saying sorry don't like you you freaked me out with the woman and
A	well I probably would've met up with him cos he was also saying that he finds it difficult to so he's moved back from
B	mm
A	having a hotshot lifestyle in Hong Kong
B	mm
A	and lives now he lives by himself but he has been living with his parents for a while
A	she lives on
B	does she?
A	yeah shall I give her a lift from er
B	yeah I'll pick her up on the way home from work
B	mm
A	high hopes for him but
B	mm
A	it wasn't didn't
B	no
A	like easy or
B	no no
A	I was nervous before he came
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
C	not by the time he left
A	yeah I wasn't that bothered
B	oh funny
A	I met a really good-looking young boy in er
B	yeah
B	yes
A	I still would
B	yes
A	like I'm almost tempted to text him whether he's
B	mm yeah
A	he's not he's not a forever
B	no no no that's like in where were we in?
A	he's twenty-four
A	don't know
B	and there's matey from
B	and you ah yeah and it was just like she sat there she went oh my goodness oh my goodness
B	oh I used to know him I used to really know him
B	oh I wish I'd put more make-up on now
B	she's like yeah
B	I still would you know
A	I'd let him break my heart all over again
B	yeah ah
B	yeah
A	he is worth a heart break though
B	he was nicely packaged
A	not in that respect
B	I didn't I didn't see that no but I mean he was sort of like the nice build and
A	he's
B	clean cut sort of yeah
C	on a different note this person that's quite nice I'm I'm twenty-four soon so
A	you are
B	mm
A	no
B	no
C	yeah no I'm
A	he showed me his driver's licence
B	what to prove how old he was?
A	no to prove his name
B	oh
A	and it was only later
A	that I was like how old are you?
A	I'm thirty and he had a sudden like oh
A	I thought he was older he thought I was younger
B	oh
B	oh
A	kind of meeting in the middle around twenty-six
B	yeah yeah yeah so for an occasion you could be twenty-six couldn't you
A	I could be twenty-six
B	yeah
A	that was a shame he lives in London as well so that's a bit complicated
B	mm
A	ah damn this complication
B	I know I know but you don't ask for much do you? just a nice decent guy who's not a druggie who's not gonna batter you who you know a decent level of
C	or murder you
B	or murder you
A	I'm not even bothered about that
B	and take you out and wine you and dine what not even talking to you?
A	joking
B	oh
B	and lives in the vicinity
A	yes
C	that was not a wish
A	oh no
C	not a wish
A	I retract I retract that one
B	er
A	er
B	and that
C	yeah yeah
B	cos of the eyelashes

B	and then it's sort of like are you gonna wish
A	yeah blow it
C	yeah but that was not a wish
B	that wasn't
A	that's good
B	you you could beg
C	just not just anybody with a pulse
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I do as well cos I rub my I get itchy eyes sometimes and I rub my
B	yeah
A	eyes and then you

A	yeah I'm not
B	when I'm
A	I'm not sitting here hankering and thinking well
B	no that's what I've just suddenly thought if it if it got later and we're like you know oh I've gotta go oh it's we're going in the hot tub it's too late so that's why I just suddenly thought now but
A	no it's er
B	would you like a coffee or a tea or a water or a squash or a?

C	no I'm just checking
B	sorry
C	pen
B	and I used to do the Tesco shop online and do stuff like that and she'd get a few bits like milk and fresh stuff and then she'd start saying oh why are you doing that? I'm just going and I can go round and she's she gets stuff for
A	does she have a car?
B	yeah yeah yeah she's got a little automatic Peugeot one 0 six or one 0

B	no true it's red
A	I've made an amazing new tea discovery recently called chai have you er tried it?
B	no
A	might sneak that into your er your bag
A	it's erm so Starbucks do a chai latte which is a bit different to the Twinings teabags
B	mm
A	so it's a bit like erm
B	I don't like Earl Grey so I don't drink that
A	just normal tea
B	right with milk in
A	little bit of milk
B	oh right yeah cos I don't put milk in

C	can you drink it with
A	yeah you can if you want
A	erm it's spiced so it's
B	mm
A	kind of it's wintery kind of spicy flavours
B	right

B	no
B	she likes cinnamon but no not really
C	I've just been drinking peppermint tea
A	I love it I find it really cosy and warming
C	yeah
B	I drink peppermint

A	no
B	no but they did that didn't they and that sort of then went did they go to New Zealand?
A	er Australia for seven weeks for the Ashes
B	Australia that's right yeah yeah
A	yeah I don't know what they've got planned next but
B	mm
A	no they're having a good time my dad's okay as well
B	yeah
A	he just took my
B	mm
A	she's always been old but she's suddenly in the last couple of years cos she had breast cancer
B	yeah
A	and so
B	yeah
A	she's just been treated for that so that was a bit traumatic and she has
B	porosis
A	osteoporosis
A	poriasis?
B	yeah
A	erm so she's had a few breaks this year so she's
B	mm
A	in a lot of pain with her back
B	oh
A	erm
B	yes
A	bit nervous and
B	yeah suddenly they get into the next age bracket don't they?
A	yeah she's she's still pretty much of a trouper
B	mm
A	and er but she's getting a bit older so she's less erm independent than she was so
B	mm
A	my dad's hired a boat for her on the Norfolk Broads and
B	oh
A	erm so she can go
B	mm
A	er went and camped next to the boat with the little dog for the week
B	ah
A	and he paid for all the boat and arranged it all and
B	yeah
A	so she cos they used to go to the Broads when they were younger
B	mm
A	and so she's got a real affiliation for it cos a couple of years ago she went with my dad his brother and erm my uncle's son
B	mm
A	my cousin erm and it was a bit hectic for her I think so
B	yeah
A	just her doing it by herself was a
B	yeah
A	bit nicer but yeah my dad went camping I'll show you some see if I can get some pictures up of the little dog and er
B	mm it is nice
A	they went to Skye to see
B	yeah
A	and he stayed camped nearby so that erm
B	mm
A	so that she can
B	well it's nice cos it it's precious times you get when when you do things like that isn't it?
A	and
B	mm
A	she's
B	can you turn it this way?
B	oh is it a little Yorkie?
A	no it's a little Chihuahua
B	no a Chihuahua?
A	I'll get you a better picture
B	oh
A	he likes cheese
B	yeah
B	looks like a Corgi there
A	yeah he does a bit
B	yeah it's like
B	it's like oh
C	is that a
A	yeah
C	yeah it looks like what
B	okay
C	fluffy Chihuahua pup
B	mm
A	and no it's not very interesting
A	and dad did one before where he sometimes photoshops out the lead so there was a picture of him up a mountain
B	mm yeah
A	and you couldn't and he photoshopped out his lead so it just looked like he'd climbed a mountain
B	ah that's nice yeah
A	he is sweet
B	oh sounds
A	yeah I think he is yeah
B	like having having good ideas and things to do and yeah
A	do you know what? it's strange cos he is actually just a really quiet reclusive person
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	enjoys going off and that's his ideal thing sitting
B	yeah
A	by week for a week in his own tent and
B	yeah
A	then occasionally going off for fish and chips with my grandma
B	yeah
A	and
B	oh it's nice
A	when my my grandma first told us about the boat and she said oh and there's a young man who I'll I'll meet up with for fish and chips I didn't realise at that point my dad was going I was like who is this young man that's going to meet you?
B	yeah she's found someone that ticks all the boxes
A	yeah
A	how strange
B	mm
B	yeah well my nana she is ninety-four I think
A	wow
B	well ninety-three ninety-four
A	mum's mum?
B	my mum yeah
A	your mother's mum?
B	my mum yeah so it's mum's mum yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah erm so she goes over every few weeks and I do two or three times a year I'll send erm either a postcard or a little something or other you know what I mean erm just something
A	a little contact but a low key?
B	yes yeah I mean you can't ring her on the phone because she's worried about the phone she thinks it has erm like microwave signals that go into your head she won't use a mobile go anywhere near a mobile she's convinced that's gonna give you brain damage and even on a phone she struggles and
A	mm
B	so I say again mum rings her and other so like it's I got the contact but it's not obviously I'd love to go and see her but it's not happening
A	mm
B	erm but she was she always used to have er she's got quite a few food problems so she can't eat various things erm she has to have her own bread made and then she
A	what's she eat it with?
B	toast or bread yeah yeah so so she'll have that every two weeks she basically uses a whole jar of this stuff erm so I said to mum right leave it with me I'll so I got in touch with the Co-op erm or the people that made it for the Co-op and tracked back to that and then
B	it's by the time they got somebody who was gonna do it from the archives and then they were gonna send it and then they were gonna do
A	yeah yeah
B	in the end I managed to get hold of a company and found and it's the the
A	crates of it yeah
B	to be sent you know
A	yeah
B	sent to her and like that and mum said erm cos apparently mum said she was eating this she said they're getting this it's Tesco value and it looks like water almost but
A	mm
B	but actually and this is what I was gonna say is she if if I have something's gonna be delivered one of them's gonna have to stay awake at at all time but to stay awake in the day at some at every point just in case it comes to hear the door so they can't both go and have a sleep for a while and I was like oh bless
B	you know just like please don't say anything it's because we we we can't both go to bed and have a sleep cos she lives there with her erm her son
A	oh
B	who's got various medical problems and psychological problems one thing and another but yeah so basically yeah so it's
A	oh
B	yeah no
C	the elderly get stressed so easily though don't they? they panic and worry about everything
B	yeah
A	it's strange isn't it? cos you don't ever see yourself getting to that
B	no
A	stage but
B	no
A	is it cos so much changes do you think by the time that you're older or?
B	I think yeah I think you've
A	I can understand being scared of mobiles if you
C	because when you're like the if you know from strong from being a kid you don't have any worries when you then start school you get really busy and then from school to work you're always busy
B	mm mm
A	mm
C	if you have kids you're always busy
B	mm
C	and then when you get to the point of retirement and getting older you've certainly got a lot of time on your hands and you've
A	yeah
C	got time to worry whereas now you don't have time to worry about whether your phone
B	mm
C	because if you don't have it with you then you can't get in contact with them and they can't get in contact with you so you don't have time to worry what it's doing to your brain
A	yeah
C	think that's what it is
B	yeah
C	whereas when you're elderly you've got time to think about what it could do
A	unless it's already fried it
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	sort of technology and stuff yeah I'm really good I've
C	mm
B	and I think as you get older more and more doesn't quite go in and it doesn't quite make sense and you can't quite make it work and you're feeling tired and you're this and you're that
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
C	I think it helps as well though as as you I mean if you look back to say when you were younger there
B	mm
C	wasn't a great deal of technology
B	no
C	whereas when I've been young there's been a lot of technology
B	yeah
C	so I've
B	yeah
C	learned from being quite little how to use technology
B	yeah
C	and to understand technology
A	mm
B	mm
C	and although yes technology progresses it's the same basic concept
B	yes
C	whereas phones are getting more and more you know
B	yeah
C	but they're still the same concept of how to work a phone
B	yeah
C	so like with the remote controls and
B	mm
C	I've learnt from being very little how to use Sky and how to use
B	yeah yeah
C	a this TV remote and how to change between that and that so then when it goes onto a bigger remote I still understand it because it's still the basic concept of the remote controls I've been used to using as being little
B	yeah
C	so just still the same basic
B	mm
C	I get older it'll be the
A	mm
C	same sort of thing if things change the way that they're done it'll be
B	yeah
C	hard but a tablet is the same as a phone so they developed this new thing the tablet
B	yeah
C	but it's the same as a phone
B	yeah
C	so I still understand how to use it from picking it up straightaway because I know how to use my phone
A	mm
B	mm
C	you know and I think that's it like I
B	mm
C	and he's been trying to record stuff
B	he's eighty-three
C	yes he's eighty-three he's been trying to record stuff and he then can't get it back and can't find it when it's been recorded so I said I'd go round and show him how to do it and I figured out what he's been doing there was two problems he had the first problem which I went and sorted was he's got SD and HD
B	mm
C	and he's been on the wrong box so he's been pushing stuff on the wrong box that's why the light's on but he's not on it cos he's in the wrong box so
B	mm
C	so that's how it works the second problem he's had is when everything changed over to digital the TVs have all changed the way they work so whereas when you used to put your TV on if you have Sky it would generally jump straight to your Sky box
A	mm
C	or straight to your Freeview box now generally when you put the telly on it will go on to erm digital TV if you've got a TV that's got digital TV it will go on to that and you have to put it onto the
B	mm
C	and he wasn't doing that he was basically setting a a reminder for a TV programme thinking he was recording it and then couldn't get it back because he actually wasn't recording it so I think that's
B	mm
C	you have to make sure you're on HDMI twelve if you're not on that you're not gonna record and then I've written down how to record and how to get it back as well but I was trying to explain it to
B	mm
C	him
A	mm
C	and I think I mean when he was young there wasn't TVs
B	mm
C	that's why like I say again I understand TVs and how they
B	yeah
C	I help him with a lot of the programming of the all the systems
B	yes she was the his apprentice and now she's she's got up to be like technician level apparently that's what
C	when he when he's not here I'm technical help for mum
B	oh yeah definitely yeah
A	excellent
C	she'll ring me and she'll go so on this and and cos
B	yeah
C	no I'm playing here right mum no you've been pushing for
C	you've been playing you've changed the TV
C	the lounge
B	yeah
C	the dining room and she's been pushing that and she's changed it in there
B	like no I I know the one that one's the lounge that the reason that was off was because all the power went off and it had to reboot and it
C	no it wasn't it was on to radio
A	we had a power cut
C	it doesn't go on the radio
A	no erm I came back at the weekend and all my cooker was off
A	and
B	yeah
A	my microwave and then I forget that my central heating resets
B	yeah yeah
A	and suddenly I'm freezing cold
B	mm
A	I don't know why my central heating's not coming on
B	mm
A	it's cos it's only it only thinks it's four o'clock in the afternoon
C	yeah no that's definitely not the reason you've been pushing the remote control
B	mm
C	on the radio it doesn't go on the radio when it when it the
B	radio?
C	it was on Kiss FM
B	how can you ever put it on the radio?
C	you put it on Kiss FM
B	oh on the telly?
C	on the telly you changed the telly to the radio bit on the telly you remember we showed you all yeah the radio
B	oh yeah the radio as in the the radio channels guide?
C	as in our TV no no no as in on the TV you have to get it on the
B	I've never put it on the radio
C	you know
B	that's probably
C	maybe you know
B	yeah no
C	you know the the the main like hub box that controls everything that's in the box and the like the cupboard bit in there?
B	no but yeah oh the amp?
C	the really big amp thing
B	yeah the amp yeah
C	yeah it's not an amp it's a box but yeah that
B	mm
C	has got a inbuilt radio on the
B	AV yeah
C	yeah it's got an in-built radio and that's what it was on someone's been pushing buttons when it's on the remote
B	right
C	so you've been pushing buttons
B	oh that would've just been me thinking why is it going off in yeah
C	exactly that's what I mean you're pushing buttons
B	I push buttons
A	it does feel like you have an overly erm
C	it is
B	yeah
C	it is
A	so don't feel
C	cos like all the lights are
C	I wanna have the lights on my phone how do I get that? how do I get the lights on my phone?
B	so
C	cos I wanna be able to control the lights so I can muck with
B	can I I can can I bump you a whatsit?
C	I dunno?
B	okay let me do that in English can I?
C	can you bump me out?
B	yeah
C	depends on what it is
B	Airdrop you an app
C	what was it called LightwaveAV?
B	yeah no LightwaveRF
C	oh
B	oh yeah
B	and another time she goes alright she'll come in and go
C	it's free anyway
B	oh I've seen you before er yeah
A	it's been quite a long time though hasn't it?
B	yeah oh yeah
C	I wanna we're not gonna tell
C	make him think the lights are going funny and this is why I get these apps it's not so that I can use them particularly unless
A	for covert light changing
C	oh yeah it's great fun
B	mm
C	we we have battles like there's little there's battles in the hot tub
B	mm
C	and then of who can like up the other and then there's also battles in the house so I get the remotes and start pushing buttons and stop it from doing what he wants it to do it's great fun
B	was this?
C	and you can also control each other's laptops as well with certain things like the sound and stuff so if you go and use it over there I can go on it and I can go turn the music volume down
B	I want to I want to get the app that does his hearing aids
B	because there's a pass code and I keep trying to look and see I say I wanna know cos if he's not listening to me I can just turn his hearing aids up
B	and then he can hear me and he can't say he's not listening
C	what's the login?
A	does he have two?
C	I need the login
B	no well
A	just one
B	yeah no he's got two he
C	email address it says here
B	oh email address?
A	mm
B	that he can hear and he went and had hearing tests and he's he finds it really bad if you're out somewhere and there's a lot of noise he can't hear erm
C	god we're predictable
B	yeah I know erm he can't he can't hear any conversation so he went and had his ears tested yes there's various things they gave him these hearing aids but they keep coming out and apparently they've got this sort of silicon stuff they can paint on them but they've got to have an okay from health and safety before any of them are allowed to paint this stuff on the hearing aids so six months later they've still not been done they still haven't got the okay from health and safety so they're falling out so he's stopped wearing them
A	mm
B	shame cos they were making a difference when we were somewhere loud he
A	yeah
B	like I can hear
A	mm
B	he said otherwise I feel stupid cos I'm like going oh yeah mm and I can't hear can't hear so
C	oh
B	yeah so he's he's got them for that but until he gets the erm oh she's off on the lights it's so funny when in the hot tub cos the the get in there we all start off without any any jets on we're just sat in there and sat in there and the the remote control thing's bobbing around and one of them gets it and goes dark you can't really see and then they press it on and it's the one they have and they're ready and
C	cold
B	so they one of them and all of a sudden they go jump one of them shoots off and goes ah
C	I I know this when I lean forward now I watch and
B	yeah
C	but we also do the thing where so you can splash the other one as much so I'm on
B	yeah
C	tidal waves and just literally lean back and
B	like a hose thing
C	hose pipe thing and he put it on the actual jet and he sat there
C	and also did it like that and I was like
B	yeah he had this hose water hose thing it absolutely blasting me with water
B	they don't splash me cos I don't like it I don't like water in my face so I I have a nice relaxing hot tub time
A	oh that's good of them
B	nice and chilled nice jets and yeah and
A	that's good of them
B	and they're just being children

C	I've learnt a trick at the post office right this is what this is what someone at work does she says if you wanna go in you know the post office in town's always really busy? what you have to do is go in look really flustered and looking around panicked and this lovely lady comes and goes oh come on dear you're on your lunch break aren't you? and takes you right to the front of the queue
B	mm
B	yeah
C	and someone else tried it on her saying and it worked for them as well
C	like if she really really has got half an hour and there's all these people that are going in here
B	yeah
C	no no no it's not that busy but at the one in town it's massive and you have to get a ticket and wait
C	if you're stood there waiting for half an hour
B	mm
E	it's a wonder other people don't kick off especially with a ticket
C	but if people are retired or jobless and just in there and taking
B	you'd kick off wouldn't you
C	yeah but if I've got half an if we've got half an hour lunch break and we're like trying to go and do something it apparently works no one's ever made a fuss of her just look flustered
B	mm

E	quick question if your tax code goes down do you pay less tax?
B	if your tax code goes down you've
E	so I'll be paying more tax yeah
C	so you'll get
B	you'll be paying more tax yes
E	bugger me
B	has your tax code gone down
E	well I had my tax code come today
B	yeah?
C	you wanna ring them and double check it's right if there's no reason for it to have changed it shouldn't've changed shouldn't've gone down
B	yeah cos it normally is
E	only gone down one
B	beginning of April it normally changes
E	gone down one
C	what are you
B	one what?
E	eh?
C	what are you what are you on?
E	I think it was ninety-eight something I'll show you cos I I thought to myself
B	I know
A	I'm never on the same one at
B	and then it
C	I think
B	and it came and then it was changed down to fifty-eight something and I got in touch with the accountant
C	a think a thousand L means you can earn ten thousand pounds before you're taxed
B	and he said
B	he said oh they're
E	I know I don't pay a lot but I pay a hundred and thirty pound a month hundred and eighty odd
B	five hundred and eighty-nine
C	and then they'll give you a
B	personal allowance you're entitled to is
C	if they've given it you this late it you are er it'll be backdated to take it from
B	over seventy-seven with a yearly income of less than that
E	I never had a tax rebate
C	no you won't get a rebate they'll ask you for money if they if you're they're taxing you more and then you haven't been paying that amount of tax they'll they'll take some off your pension then
E	at my age you don't pay any
C	why not ring them and check?
B	you get a decent pension though don't you?
A	it's almost like they make it confusing on purpose so that people can't check
B	mm
A	I never understand when I get these letters I can't like
C	you need to ring them and check
E	I don't understand that
C	well there's
B	yeah
C	if there's no reason for it to have changed it shouldn't've changed if anything you there's been more tax allowance this year than there was the previous year cos mine's gone up from like something like nine nine something L to a thousand L which means I can earn ten thousand pounds before I'm taxed
A	so everyone can earn the same amount before they get taxed
C	depends on what your wage is yeah it depends on what you earn
B	yeah
A	well
B	no every
A	everyone gets the same amount and then there's the same amount in the next bracket you get
B	everybody you're entitled to ten thousand
E	yeah
C	yeah because if you earn over thirty-three thousand pounds
A	but
C	a year you'll be taxed at forty percent that's their bracket
A	but but the first ten thousand is still free
C	yeah you still get a certain amount yeah exactly yeah and mine's based at ten thousand L so it will
A	yeah
C	a thousand L so basically I get that and then I'm not taxed any more I'm
A	that's good I get more money
C	oh
A	end of this week
C	then it'll be back to normal pay
A	oh nice
A	oh it's a shame it's not extending a little bit further cos
A	but
B	we can
E	I'll get it out tonight
B	get it out and I'll have a look and if necessary
B	mm
E	might be why
B	mm
E	don't see why I should
B	night
A	goodnight
C	but I think I did we did a hundred and eleven hours a lot of us and in two in like what was it a month or two months a month I think for about a month we did a hundred and eleven hours
B	mm
C	of overtime on top of our normal hours and we were all knackered so then when I finished a lot of us went
A	yeah
A	it's a tough payoff isn't it when you're like oh more money
B	mm
A	but exhausted?
C	well there was there was two incentives you could either do two weeks' worth and get a certain amount or you did three weeks' worth of your contract sales and got a bit more and by the time you'd done the two weeks you're like oh I feel great I feel great I can do one more week's worth of contracted hours that was the hardest one everyone did
B	mm
C	because we all all decided to carry on and then it was like
A	yeah
C	oh my god I don't wanna do this but when you had a
B	yeah
C	I can't say no like
