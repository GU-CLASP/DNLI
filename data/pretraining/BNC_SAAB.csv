C	mm
B	he's very prompt isn't he?
C	he's always on a time clock my
A	sounds familiar
C	it's kind of like a
A	bit rigid
C	a bit rigid
A	mm
C	erm I'll pick you up at twelve and you could set your clock by it
C	and he drops him back and two minutes later he's left the house
C	mm
B	yeah
C	and has a boyfriend who
A	ah
B	quite right
A	yeah
C	erm and
B	have they? oh I didn't that
C	I thought that was a bit much it's our family well the husbands that's different but the boyfriend of six months? no
A	no not necessarily included
C	no
A	yeah
B	I thought you were going to make a comment on the sleeping arrangements
A	yeah so did I
C	in what sense? my dad?
B	well no I the fact that they might be inviting him to come and stay at their house
A	stay at their house well once you've left home it's kind of allowed isn't it?
C	oh yes no I don't I don't mind
B	don't you remember the episode with
B	was it
C	mm they were deeply embarrassed because
B	they suddenly got the
C	once we'd announced that I was having a baby
B	oh that's right
A	you stayed together
C	well no nothing had we we'd never been back just you know it wasn't far enough along but then
A	grandma and grandad's?
A	mm
C	erm and every time they've gone before they had separate rooms and without saying anything to them they just made them the double bed
A	grandma and grandad?
C	mm and when they went upstairs they found that there weren't any
B	there wasn't any
C	other options
A	no that just wasn't
C	and
A	oh god
C	it was all highly embarrassing
A	embarrassing
B	mm
C	no I I'd I mean sleeping nowadays it's not it's not even
C	I don't think people think about it any more
B	it's taken for granted is it?
C	it's taken for granted
B	I don't know I wonder what
C	mm but I I think
B	and Christian
C	I don't know
B	I think you may be making an assumption there
C	maybe but
A	in most cases once your child has left home you now they're they're considered able to make that type of
C	yeah that's right but erm no I was just meaning I thought I thought it's was actually a bit much
A	yeah fair enough
C	it's a seriously expensive restaurant
A	is it?
C	which is really absolutely fine but erm
B	well
A	yeah randomers effectively
C	randomers
A	young randomers
C	that's not
A	yeah no that's the other thing isn't it? you want it to just be the familiar people
C	mm
B	mm
A	and what about
C	yeah she hasn't got a boyfriend so he's not coming unless she's got one in the next three weeks
A	no just I was wondering if she had one
A	she's a teacher isn't she?
C	mm
A	mm
B	yes
C	they're lovely girls
A	yeah they always were
C	but no I I was kind of she just dropped it into the conversation oh by by the way we've invited erm
B	what did
C	yeah erm hope that's okay but they've invited
A	well maybe he's a boyfriend from school that she's been with for years
C	yeah I don't know
B	could be
C	I thought it was inappropriate if my dad hasn't met him then it's not appropriate
A	mm
C	anyway
A	yeah
C	er too late
A	too late
C	so you can't say it afterwards you can say it before can't you?
A	mm afterwards
C	erm we were wondering whether it was appropriate to invite
A	yeah
C	that's alright
A	I do understand I mean you know you do accept the boyfriend of your children girlfriend of your children into the family don't you? because they do matter a lot to your child
C	yeah
A	so I think that's like a gesture probably to him as well isn't it? but yeah fact is that it's erm
B	didn't I hear that he was a local he was not a student at
C	oh I don't know so if that's true that could be then that he's a long-term
A	could be that he's on the scene for a few years yeah local
C	a
A	a
B	she's at
A	what does she study?
B	er film technology I think it is
C	film and
B	or film media studies
C	film and
B	film and media studies
C	yeah something like that
A	cool
B	apparently she's quite
C	it's creative anyway very creative
A	yeah well that's quite vocational isn't it? it's good
B	she was er she's already got a job or something already got a
A	mm
B	a connection which
A	love
B	they're going to make a film and I think the the class was approached for people from
A	groovy
C	mm
B	yeah I think it's this clapperboard stuff you know director's sitting in a stool and
A	yeah no people like it
B	yeah
A	I think it's getting a little bit more fashionable to do I mean media and film in
C	mm mm
B	video yeah
A	video now and the phones and everything but also you know to be a bit more technical have technical skills and have more vocational skills I mean if you're going to pay nine thousand pounds a term is it?
C	mm
A	for your university education maybe anthropology is not that key
C	a year
A	to
C	no it's kind of
B	it's a very narrow-minded idea
A	no I know it's narrow-minded but I think that people think more like that now than they used to because it's not just like you guys had a free
C	I I do no mm
A	education at university so it seems more justified
C	and it was seen as an education and it was a ticket to a job
A	liberal arts yeah
C	whereas now it's not
A	whereas now you have a degree and
B	thank the Labour party for that
C	but also
B	it was tiny
C	it was
A	now everyone goes
C	now it's forty percent
A	well not everyone but erm if you do go you have to seriously think about it because you're going to end up with a very large debt at the end of it and it has to be worth it doesn't it and the thing is that during the recession so many students graduated and couldn't find employment so it doesn't feel very optimistic it's better to do something where you say okay I train as a
C	mm
A	plumber and I'll have jobs because then
C	I was really surprised cos my friend in
A	mm
C	he he got you know far too low his grades and so instead of doing Advanced Highers he's doing his Highers again
A	mm
C	but in fact he's changed to a lot of arty things and cos his parents have said there's no point just doing the same thing again and failing again you gave it a good shot choose some other things and they're having all sorts of problems but I was saying look you know erm
A	mm
C	I said well
A	mm
C	and she said I don't think we could cope with him doing an non-vocational degree
A	bad parent sentence I don't think we could cope
C	erm well maybe that's not quite how they put it but he won't be doing that
A	yeah
C	a vocational degree at our expense
A	I mean fair enough I I do understand that at our expense
C	well you know I I'm filling all the naughty gaps in but
A	no well fair enough
C	but they don't even have to pay in Scotty land
A	he just might do really if he doesn't what he wants that's the thing
C	that's what I think
A	mm
C	that's what I want to say
A	you don't have to pay in Scotty land so what's the deal? well it's just a tougher market isn't it?
C	erm
A	mm
B	yes it is because there's
A	would you like strawberries and yoghurt
B	a Scottish thing
A	erm
C	or cheese and biscuits or
A	ooh ice cream?
C	ice cream
B	ice cream
C	Magnum
A	mini Magnum
B	delicious ice cream
C	mini Magnum
A	we were quite targeting in our shopping we didn't like get anything good we just got biscuits
C	we did a biscuits and Magnums that's alright and chocolate
A	er I agree with you
C	and red wine for dad no wine for me
A	mum's off the wine
C	I'm going to have I've I've poured the last of that bottle and oh just make sure that bangs that's it
A	mm
B	yeah
C	I'm just going to have a couple of days off
A	mum's on the
B	oblivious
A	that's the word
C	but I'll be back on it soon enough
C	but I think I'll I'll just try and go for a one a night
B	so what's the
C	once I've I
A	okay
B	is that the long-term plan for you?
A	almond classic or white?
C	almond please thank you
B	is there one white one plain left?
C	erm
B	classic please sock it to me
C	I thought er long term ought to be none in the midweek
B	none in midweek and how long does that last?
C	er it doesn't tend to last very long
B	and how long is the midweek is it Wednesday or?
C	Monday to Thursday
A	I think having a glass of wine with dinner is all respectable isn't it?
C	mm mm
A	it's what the respectable French people do
A	healthy cholesterol French people and the Eyeties
C	mm
B	yeah
A	it's always the difficulty
B	yeah they have to water it down as well
B	the French
A	excuse me so it's austerity is it?
C	thank you darling?
C	will do
B	mm
A	yeah it's a real
B	it was your idea in the first place
C	you always steal my ideas and then go for them further than I do
B	get up early and go to the paper shop you said every morning
B	mm
A	I read an article about erm can't remember some academic has done research into sleep patterns over er different age group
C	mm
A	and his discoveries were that erm the natural internal clock for erm different age groups was was was naturally different because of the chemical balance you know so for instance
C	mm
A	and then so it starts off early and then teenagers obviously always wake up late but it's not like he was trying to say it's not because they're lazy it's because they have their internal clock is transitioning and it's going it's moving to a later phase and then mid mid-twenties was like some slightly different to forties and then you kind of go back an early morning clock after the age of sixty
C	early mm
B	right
A	but he was suggesting that it would be more productive for instance to allow people in their early twenties to start work at ten AM instead of eight because
C	some schools have changed to ten o'clock
A	have they?
C	mm
A	because they're going to be more efficient
B	yeah
A	if they're because they're you know is you
C	dull feeling yeah well it's really
A	I have it I mean I'm I mean and you also have like morning people and night owls it's a typical stereotype but it is true I mean I can just see in people people that get up early have always got up early and will always get up early
B	mm
C	mm
A	and vice versa you know if I'm left to my own devices
C	mm
A	I'm quite nocturnal always and if I'm I can do like a
C	that's like dad
A	I just erm gravitate towards late nights and late mornings
C	mm
B	mm
A	it's funny isn't it? I wonder what that's about I mean it's all hormonally controlled isn't it?
C	mm
A	but he was yeah the research was suggesting that we should alter our structure according to these things and it would be more efficient I wonder how easy that would be though
C	but it's just the year before I finished the year that I finished I
A	mm
C	got their maths lesson first thing every morning
A	mm
C	erm the top set group they it it
C	they didn't want to be there
A	mm
C	and they were naturally responding to the fact that
A	they'd rather be in bed
C	it was half past eight
A	that's really early
C	and that's really early half past eight to half past nine was the lesson
A	mm
C	and even the ones who wanted to try their best were still you know like this
C	and they were just dull you know they were just dull just like you say that numb feeling
A	mm
C	when you're awake and you're trying to do it but it's just harder
A	it's just too hard yeah
C	and I think what I noticed was cos for them maths was hard some of them didn't want to be there but quite a lot of them wanted to try
A	mm
C	it's just really hard
A	mm
C	so the subject was hard and it was really hard to get themselves awake and of course as the year went on quite a lot of them were late as well
A	yeah
C	so they missed the first quarter of an hour
A	oh dear
B	oh oh
C	and so cos we'd changed the way our school worked which was a disaster as well
B	disaster
C	but we instead of having registration at half past eight you can sympathise with this and lessons starting at twenty to nine we had to share sixth form studies with our another local school
A	oh yeah I remember
C	and they had to bus between them
B	oh oh
C	and so it helped if we started at half eight and did our registration at break time
A	oh no
C	and so registration was at break
A	so no one was bothered
C	and you know people have been used to not turning up till twenty to nine and missing registration and not caring and now they were having to be in the building at
A	I was never on time for registration
C	half no and so now half eight was the beginning of the lesson
C	mm
A	meeting and cycling together to school
C	mm
A	and we just never got there on time and then eventually Mr
B	oh oh
A	because of it they were clamping down so we had then it was really annoying cos then we really had to
C	mm well we decided to clamp down but that was even before registration was at break erm but we they you had a fifteen-minute detention that day in the school hall at lunch so everybody started lunch at half twelve and you couldn't start till quarter to one
A	mm punishing
C	and cos our kids were pretty wily you were collected from your classroom
A	are you serious?
C	I am serious
A	that's pretty labour-intensive
C	it was highly labour-intensive but it was
A	the only way to be effective yeah
C	the only ways to really cos they'd have been gone and you'd be chasing them and then that's more labour-intensive
A	mm
C	so they had some of the assistant
A	so if you were late you had detention the same day at lunch
C	the same day at lunch
A	fair enough
C	and it was all done and dusted
A	well we were only doing it cos we were getting away with it
C	but my little
C	she just
B	bit of a rebel
A	yeah
A	yeah it's not that fun is it? actually they'd rather have a lunch break
C	then it whittled down over the year we did it for a year
A	mm that's good
C	and then the next year you didn't have to take them from class unless there was persistent somebody wasn't turning up then they were went and got and all that sort of stuff
A	mm no it's good to have that kind of discipline isn't it?
C	but he detentions were in my room so when it was
C	and they used to say it's not meant to be that she gets private tuition in detention
A	it's not supposed to be perks of detention maybe that's why she kept doing it
C	yeah so and they were they actually said no she has to sit and do the lines cos they had they had to write out you know some speech
A	are you serious?
C	about what it is to be a good person
A	punctual
B	oh dear
A	that's really old-fashioned
C	a good student
A	well we didn't do it
C	it was dire and they had it was like a paragraph and they had to write it three times erm just
A	Mr
C	she didn't have to look at it you know within a couple of weeks she was
A	she was
C	done
A	yes
C	ah ah
B	mm
A	it's not bad is it?
C	it's a good
A	good job for her yeah
C	she was a personable good personable lady erm but
C	you can't
A	being late is there? especially that kind of job
B	mm
C	no that's right
B	right are you done with the treasuring?
C	I'm done with today's treasuring
B	oh right
A	this is mum's ongoing job now
C	I have to erm the hideous report that I should have written before we had our meeting had to be done the monthly report but I'll do it tomorrow morning ching
B	tomorrow morning
A	what's our opinion of the floor then?
C	I'm thinking I might like to ask about the top coat
A	I think that the problem with it is the grey ones like the other ones look really nice
C	mm bit too the others are nice
A	but the grey ones look like they've been
B	they've been
C	they've been scrubbed without being
A	partly concreted by a mistake or something
A	it's just like
C	no they're not nice
A	that's the that's the unfinished look about it whereas these ones look really nice
C	you can live with mm
A	I think you probably should do the top coat
C	you can live with a couple of grey but not so much
B	not to mention the oily ones in the hallway
A	that one you should go with the
C	I no yeah but the edge of it er has got a crack all along where the grout is as well so that might have been where his machine has tried to level it cos he
A	I don't think you should be feeling a bad you know if you at least asked them about it if they had any decency they'll say of yeah we've missed that off
B	they've got a good they've got a good explanation that's fine
C	mm
A	and if they don't then they should come back and do it you can't you know they you you paid a decent price so
C	huge price
B	we paid the full whack
A	you paid the full whack and to miss out a tile is a bit much isn't it?
C	mm
A	I'm pretty such it's not done it looks quite different to the other ones
C	I don't know mm is there was another one like it it'd be
A	and I also I thought I just thought when I when she was leaving she really didn't want to be stuck on the other side of the cycle race
C	yeah and I totally understood but she rushed
C	yeah but she should have said I'm going to come back but then it's probably an hours' drive so there were lots of things playing in her head
A	yeah but that's the thing isn't it? yeah
B	that's not our fault
A	no
C	no no I know
A	no I agree with that
C	I'm not trying to say that I'm just saying
A	I'm just saying I think you should just
C	mm mm no I'll do it tomorrow
A	mm
B	something else to do tomorrow getting up early going cycling doing the treasury and getting back to Mrs T
A	Mrs T and all kinds of malarkey
C	Mrs T?
B	tile
C	Mrs Tile
B	Mrs Tile
A	Mrs Tiling dot com
C	mm
C	tile doctor
A	mm yeah so you're going to
C	yes so well it all depends on the final erm quotes and decision
C	erm it
A	such an addict of cheese just like my sister
C	regarding erm the
A	removal people yeah
C	removal people but this is a a basic idea
A	eighteenth okay
C	is that what date is it today?
B	twenty-first
A	eighteenth today is the fourteenth
B	twenty-third and fourth
A	eightieth is Friday twenty-first is Monday he's leaving in the morning
C	and the Wednesday and Thursday
B	Wednesday and Thursday
A	Wednesday and Thursday grandma
C	we go to grandma and Friday
A	Friday is the twenty-fifth
B	Friday we'll drive to
C	Friday we drive to
A	go to choir
C	go to choir and
B	I we might we might have a cat day
C	you no no no
B	oh
C	depending if
A	I slept with the cat last night
C	we would
B	did you?
A	yeah he was curled up in my little nook knee nook all night
C	oh
B	oh you allowed that to happen did you?
A	it was quite sweet actually
B	he is quite sweet
A	I was basically awake all night cos I just couldn't sleep
C	oh darn
A	anyway ay
C	er but the Thursday we could we potentially just
B	I might I might
A	come back here
C	come
A	mm
C	erm you pick me up blah and then we go heading off to
A	mm
B	fifth
C	the Friday
A	okay
B	and then we would stay up there for a whole week and have the removals done on whatever day
A	so you're just hoping that it's going to happen within a week
C	yes
A	within that week you know mm
C	that's what we need to ascertain
A	twenty-fifth to the second
B	second
C	the Friday?
