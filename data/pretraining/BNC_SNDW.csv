A	oh there's a little river there as well
B	so cute I like the woods type thing do you?
A	yeah I do
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't have
B	ah so cute
A	that's okay I think all I was saying is it comes down to this I think it's
B	yeah actually that was like
B	I mean it was just like
A	yeah
B	did you used to go to house parties?
A	yeah erm now I think of it I suppose they weren't really parties they were just everyone sitting around like there wasn't there wasn't always music and that but sitting around and having a drink and yeah somebody being sick somewhere
A	yeah they were good
B	oh really?
A	yeah like if you had to be under
B	isn't that brilliant? so hang what kind of thing erm was it how was it organised?
A	well there was one in
A	and it was just really cool everyone was about
B	so it was for that age group? who was starting to get
A	yeah
B	erm it was for that age group
A	yeah the oldest people were probably about sixteen seventeen
B	that's so good
A	it was
B	I always used to think that whenever anything was put on for that age range it was far too nerdy for any of us to go
A	a bit sad
B	that's brilliant
B	and at and at what time what sort of time like what what time did you go home?
A	it probably finished about eleven
B	that's so great
A	yeah it was it was really good
B	and probably your mum and dad could feel like it was ace as well
A	funny I don't remember getting I don't remember all we used to just seem to be able to go
B	who
A	erm I remember the little club where it is it's like a a community hall type thing that in the town and it was just an organised you know like you'd have a club night?
B	yeah
A	it was just that sort of thing it was really good but there was this one in
B	mm
A	Saturday nights was reggae nights and that was good cos it had all like the
B	oh I love The Prodigy
A	and it was just brilliant it was so exciting you could get drink in there like everyone was pissed they were on
B	really?
A	yeah you could get you could get booze in there somehow I think you had to be
B	yeah
A	sixteen to twenty-one but it we were all about fourteen fifteen
A	and they'd let us in and I dunno how we got away with it actually but they were just really good nights
B	ah that's so great did you have to get a cab home?
A	erm sometimes we used to stay at my house a bit for that and we used to stay at my friend my other friend's so I got away with quite a lot really when I think about it so sometimes my mum would pick us up sometimes we got a cab
B	yeah
A	yeah sometimes we got a cab back
B	I went through a stage where I was like between the age of fourteen and sixteen it was a constant battle against my dad to be allowed to do things
A	yeah
B	and it was mainly these house parties cos there were luckily there were a couple of parents
A	yeah
B	and she would just let her have a massive party and erm
B	you might see her at the beginning erm
A	irresponsible
B	not right but
A	yeah
B	are they gonna be supervised?
A	and they'd go yeah
B	and
B	she was never there
A	oh
B	so I'm lucky I didn't have teenage pregnancy or something
A	oh
B	because basically we all slept in the same rooms I remember
B	but nothing you know really untoward happened
A	really untoward
B	erm but and then there was another there was a guy whose parents used to let him have a party
A	mm
B	but they were honest so my dad would call up in fact my dad knew him
A	mm
B	cos he was their lawyer and he would say is it erm supervised? and they would say no
B	and in fact
B	that bloke's mother said to my mum if I were you I wouldn't let her come
B	so
A	it is a bit shall I put it back on?
B	is it toasty?
A	put it back on it's alright
B	I think I went too far the other way
B	yeah and I was like bloody thanks a lot I couldn't believe it I was totally doomed then
A	oh
B	so when it was that guy's house I was I start cos I made such a stink about it with my dad like the it was constant rows about these parties so at
A	mm mm
B	and then this other guy he had them quite a lot so then my dad went for a compromise I was allowed to go but of course no way was I allowed to stay over
A	stay the night
B	but that meant my dad had to come and get me and then he would like decide on the time
A	yeah
B	it was so mortifying
A	yeah
B	be like my dad's here to get me
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and of course dad doesn't wanna stay up till like two
A	no
B	so he would probably come and get me at
A	no ten twelve
B	maybe like twelve
A	yeah
B	or in fact maybe even a bit earlier and that was just so
B	it meant that nothing could really get going for me do you know what I mean? cos it was like
A	yeah
B	it all had an end time
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	whereas at
A	what age was that?
B	well that was probably between fourteen and sixteen but cos I remember one time I remember that when I hit seventeen I was suddenly just allowed to do it all
A	yeah
B	to go clubbing and everything whereas before I had been clubbing but it wasn't allowed
A	yeah
B	erm but then it was wonderful
B	thank you dad for letting me go one year before the legal age
B	erm and then we really did also though I was I was one of the youngest in my year so you can't so I was probably
A	yeah
B	probably
B	when I yeah so erm but at
A	brilliant
B	and erm and and then all the interesting stuff starts to happen all these conversations that you have like there would always be some boy who you hadn't spoken to before and you'd suddenly be sat on the farm gate
A	mm
B	at dawn chatting so really deep about something
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	oh
A	and er she wasn't from it was all a bit wrong all of it like
A	and he was just hideous
B	oh no
A	and she said erm and she'd just picked him up I dunno they'd been out all been out somewhere we'd got home about eleven and then her mum come home even later like sometimes the mum would come home sometimes she wouldn't sort of thing like
B	yeah
A	we could just go and stay there whenever and it didn't really matter
A	imagine if your mum came home and did that
B	yeah
A	said that in front of you and
A	you know what I mean? and I just thought oh right yeah and you couldn't say no you were staying at their house but
B	yeah
A	I just thought how bizarre
B	actually erm I would like to go home
A	that that goes on
B	look at that one
A	is that a redwood there?
B	we we can't see how tall they they're getting
A	let's have some
B	we're not at the tallest bit
A	is this the redwood forest?
B	I think we're
A	trees are beautiful
B	yeah
A	yeah we're getting distracted
B	mm
A	and the fun and parties and all of that sort of thing
B	but no I mean like our topics I'm trying to think now what
A	oh
B	I'm actually starting to feel like we're just now getting into normal every day conversation and we've forgotten
A	I don't mind
B	things that I'm sure there was something things that I really wanted to tell you but I can't remember what they are now
A	well
B	we haven't finished covering the theory of everything though have we?
A	the theory of everything will never end
B	yeah
A	how much I disliked that job
B	now it's all just
A	yeah
B	yeah you were gonna tell me about that job
A	oh I know what I'll tell you about the it was more like it was start where it ended yesterday
B	was it because you didn't finish telling me about the thing
A	I'm determined to tell you
B	yeah because I realised at one point yesterday I was like so hang on I still don't know about the project
A	well it's not really urgent and we there were far bigger fish to fry cos we came across that lovely scenery and all that stuff so it's fun like
B	yeah
A	it's not a
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	which I thought was good erm but also cos I thought he's gonna make loads of money because like Zumba erm
B	mm
A	it's not really new but it is a new thing if you market it as a new thing and sell it as a new thing and I had I had everything done for it so basically what happened then was I spent
B	are are you gonna tell me
A	well it's so simple it's so so so so simple so
B	mm
A	squats but holding onto the baby so you squat and then you lift up the baby and that's your shoulder press and then you twist
B	no
A	either standing or not standing basically I got a girl to do this once I got a girl to do a class with her baby
B	yeah
A	and demonstrate so I could demonstrate and it was and she was properly in a sweat
B	I bet that was really helpful cos you can then really see what
A	well it was it was so so so so good I think it was so good and I think it's the sort of thing that girls when you've had a baby they wanna get into shape but they don't wanna go to a gym and they it would have been a sociable thing it would have been a
B	mm
A	there were so many good things to it
B	mm
A	it's such a good idea and then I went on Youtube
B	was there a
A	yeah sit-ups crunches erm planks so many things you can do with a baby and they're more importantly they're things that you need to be able to do if you've got a baby you need to have be able to have good erm coordination and good core strength and good balance and
B	mm
A	good you know what I mean? like there's all these things that to
B	and also
A	oh
B	is there some bits where the baby is just laid there?
A	yeah but
B	but I was thinking
A	when you do a press-up
A	that's it
B	do you know what I mean? why should she not
A	but it's actually a bonding thing for babies you see because
B	mm
A	you're
B	mm
A	lifted and they like all that and
B	yeah
A	babies as young as two there's a problem with obesity is babies as young as two cos they're not moving enough they're not doing this and in this exercise you can see the baby was kicking and like all doing the things that they should do
B	yeah
A	like moving and it was such a genius genius idea and when I would tell people about it they'd all go oh yeah that's a really good idea I'd do that I dunno if they were just being polite
B	and what did that girl think? the one who did it? the one
A	she thought it was a really good workout
B	mm
A	and sweating and but the baby liked it the baby would like oh not that I'm gonna send it to you cos I'm sure you
B	yeah
A	anyway so
B	mm
A	so I thought to myself
B	mm
A	unless you come up with something original
B	a brand or something
A	or come up with some or unless you were just happy doing all the classes and all the rest of it and
B	mm
A	anyway
B	mm
A	like if you're an electrician electrician
B	mm
A	it's like being Corgi registered that says you are legit erm
B	yeah
A	you've got all the necessary things and you're fit to work in that industry
B	yeah
A	it's basically another money spinning thing really erm so I phoned them up and I said look so if I have an idea of a course how do I go about it? and I said oh yeah yeah yeah we do all that
B	yeah
A	follow this procedure you've gotta follow all this information so and it was not a straightforward thing you had to do a course to show that you're able to teach so a very like a basic teach your class
B	yeah
A	what you do is you you get the idea and you develop it into a course and then the idea
B	do you have to pay for all of this?
A	yeah through the nose and the idea would be that I've got this idea you're a fitness instructor you come on my course pay me the money then you're allowed to go and teach my course
B	oh I see yeah yeah yeah
A	that's how that's how Zumba worked
B	yeah
A	that's how they made all their money cos they've got the Zumba
B	yeah
A	and that's how you make your money
B	yeah
A	a hundred and fifty was quite a good amount now if you get six people on your course obviously you've gotta pay your taxes and all the rest of it and your room hire where you're gonna teach
B	yeah
A	but six people hang on what is that?
B	sorry I'm just
A	that's a grand a day
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh sorry
A	so like you know if you go on a creative
B	but is it like an and is it like erm they can't teach your thing without you teaching them? like is there like erm
A	yeah a qualification
B	but is it also a erm what d'you call it? a erm approved course? so that you have to have a but have you got like not copyright but do you know what I mean?
A	yeah totally
B	yeah
A	so like for me if I wanted to be able to teach spin
B	mm
A	erm so yeah that was the idea so I looked into it I
B	yeah
A	so I was writing this manual as it so happened
B	oh yeah I remember
A	do you remember? so I was off for a month looking after him and I'd do that in the evenings or in the day or whatever and do you want me to steer?
A	I can steer I don't mind
B	that's so bad isn't it? I've done I've finished now doing it now
A	carry on
B	it's alright it's alright
A	it's not really bad
A	people do eat don't they as they're going along?
B	where's the drive-through coffee place?
A	yeah I am getting a bit like jittery
B	yeah lightheaded and you know
A	I could just do with a fix
B	I didn't know that we would have this I I don't I know that sounds daft but I just
A	what the woods?
B	I didn't know that we would have this road
A	redwood territory
B	yeah
A	and it
B	yeah
A	cos that's gonna go in my favour and all the rest of it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B	yeah
A	so I do had to do loads of courses on one of these courses I met this woman erm and she was really nice I really liked her
A	the bottom line is I did loads of work I went on two courses
B	yeah
A	ah that's it I had to do a course another course in erm
B	yeah yeah
A	especially cos if you're doing any
B	yeah
A	it took about a year longer really I took days off I got this girl to come and film the thing I had to get
B	yeah
A	I had to pay him to do that I had to ask the people that I used to work for doing personal training if I could have that room to do the filming in I had to do so much work then it got to this point
B	yeah
A	thing so what do you mean? erm now I'd already seen another bit in the same fucking manual
B	yeah
A	that says you can
B	yeah
A	so you can do it or what? so
B	yeah
A	I called up this woman and this was when I realised that people don't know what the fuck they're doing
B	yeah yeah
A	so I called up this woman I said hello erm
B	I can just imagine I can just imagine
A	this was in August right? which was just after everything else that had gone wrong that year not a very good year and I'd been working on it and working on it and working on it and doing all these horrible jobs that I hated thinking well pretty soon
B	erm
A	I'll be teaching this course and I'm gonna make about
B	oh
A	a thousand pounds a per day
B	for this yeah
A	so I got it and I this I phoned up this woman I said hello I just I've been working on this and I said I've just come across this bit that says you can't use babies for a weight and she said
A	well this is it right I'm not being funny
A	has just said that it's it's what it's called functional exercise
B	exercise
A	yeah it's what is called functional exercise so it's the opposite of you know men go to the gym and they just work on that muscle cos they want that muscle so they'll do all these exercises just to build up this particular muscle
B	yeah
A	cos they wanna look like a certain way
B	yeah
A	and they're the best exercises so
B	yeah
A	when we were all cave people we were all getting exactly the right kind of exercise by running away from dinosaurs climbing up trees swimming
B	yeah
A	erm in all the things that you needed to be able to do you've got just
A	cos you
B	yeah
A	in your everyday life
B	yeah
A	so that's
B	yeah
A	so it's all exercise it's just you don't call it exercise but this was
B	yeah exactly
A	this was calling it exercise and was gonna be a new craze like
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	so what happened then on that conversation? so it was like oh
A	well no she said yeah not a very good idea and I thought you know you can't lose your temper because you might need these people to be nice to you somehow
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean? you can't say what you're really thinking but I did say to her I said well what cos I felt like saying what do you mean not a good idea? you're doing it all day long and you've got a baby
B	cos
A	what do you mean it's not a good idea?
A	yeah
B	when you said I'm thinking about doing this and they said these are all the things you've gotta do?
A	well this is it right what I've realised this has been a a fantastic exercise in the
B	yeah
A	so you think you're talking to people that know what they're talking about they don't they don't know what they're talking about
B	also it's the fact that no matter what you're doing you call the thing up
A	mm
B	in any situation
A	mm
B	so maybe some research for this trip
A	yes
B	you call the thing up and you go is it gonna be okay to do this that and the other? and they go yeah all you've gotta do is this
A	mm
B	then it doesn't work
A	it's wrong
B	it all goes to shit you call up and the
A	yeah
B	other person that you speak to on that day
A	is all they've left
B	says well of course you can't do that
A	yeah
B	and then you say
A	that I
B	that last time I spoke to you
A	yeah yeah
B	and now this is something that I can't get used to and I still haven't managed to remember to do it cos you always get the name of the first person so you can go Clive Anderson said
A	yes
B	but I never do but my dad's really good at that he'll
B	and also makes them shit themselves
A	mm
B	cos my dad'll say can I have your name please?
A	cos then you're culpable aren't you?
B	yeah
A	then you're culpable for it
B	otherwise you're just some moron on the end of the phone going but I rang up a week ago and someone said
B	but the other thing
A	this is it
B	for all these things everything where you have to ring up and find out should we be ringing twice just to check?
A	well
A	right
B	I called up and said
A	do we need an international
B	I said
A	cos so far no one gives a monkey's
A	oh right
B	so with this one nobody had mentioned it and I rang up and said it doesn't mention additional driving
A	right
B	when I'm back erm
A	oh right
B	so then I spent twenty minutes on the AA website trying to build my own coverage cos erm they they've got their standard ones and then they've got build your own erm and it I was doing really well I was like oh it's only gonna be this much it's brilliant and we'll get free extra driver in America and
A	mm
B	and I even worked out so so anal I even worked out how much more it was gonna cost me to
A	mm
B	it was like six pounds
B	I could have charged you three do you know what I mean?
B	erm
B	I I just I thought oh what is it okay that I'm the
A	oh yeah
B	so I called again right and I said just to check
A	yeah
B	erm with this AA membership
A	yeah
B	is it okay if I'm the member and I'm the initial driver and will will my friend still be free? and he went oh there's no need to worry about that because in California additional drivers are free anyway
B	thank you very much goodbye
B	and then I just sat there and went mum
B	she was like what now? what now? I was like I just spent forty minutes
B	researching the AA and I bloody called back and and and then
A	this is what I'm saying the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing it's partly because everything is so complicated now
B	well you feel like saying to the bloke thank you very much for your help can I also speak to any colleague
A	yeah anyone
B	just to ask them the same question?
A	yeah
B	in California which is why overall the car hire is cheaper not just because we have less days but because we were taking it over the state line
A	yeah
B	so then we were having a drop off fee and erm an additional driver fee which doesn't apply in California so anyway so it's totally the same
A	it's total bollocks
B	not a good idea so what happened then?
A	it is total well this is what I'm saying like people don't so
A	yeah but I thought at this
B	yeah
A	consultants for a year I've done this course I've done that course I've bought this I've put in that because you're consultant it's so funny though what's happened since then because
B	just drink this water
A	cut a long story short no I can't cut a long story short at all
A	erm
B	yeah
A	so I said look in your guide it says this so can you check that against the insurers please? so I had to wait about two weeks and I kept on and on and on and
B	yeah
A	because I thought I don't wanna totally lose my rag in case
B	and then burn your bridges and everything
A	well in case it does have a bearing as it turns out I could have done cos it's all a Mickey
B	yes
A	I think
B	yes and your emails were really good
A	well I
B	did it take you ages to write those? because
A	not really cos
B	what's this?
A	to give somebody a what for
B	slide ahead
A	slide ahead
A	go on
B	it said earlier slide area and I thought it just meant some rocks might fall and now it's saying slide ahead
A	that means slide ahead though
B	doesn't it just mean
A	a slide ahead
B	it it's a
A	oh maybe it's yeah a gradient
A	see I bet loads of people have just gone
A	and straight off now if you went off there where would you end up?
A	right down there yeah there's no there's no
B	there's no coming back from there
A	oh it's a little lake
B	ah
A	yeah it's a little lake
B	I have been sort of looking out to see if erm
A	there's a tent down there and a little
B	ah
A	look it's like a little camping site it all looks abandoned though
B	oh it's not a Starbucks then?
A	yeah it looks a little bit derelict
B	does it?
A	see I'd be too scared to stay out here
B	oh look at here
A	no actually no I would for one day
B	well we were in that place last night with the erm oh look look at that little one
B	is it blue again?
A	yeah
B	yeah we were there last night like basically in the town and I still was dreaming that there were two men outside the window
B	do you know what I did?
A	were they nice?
B	no
A	oh
B	they were gonna do bad things
B	I started to think those windows are really not brilliant windows like they're not
A	what those mosquito ones?
B	the ones where you just well it was the mosquito net that made me decide it was okay
A	mm
B	cos the windows themselves I thought they can just go
B	but I thought oh but there's a mosquito net
A	mm
B	like as if that would stop someone I guess but
B	erm
A	mm
B	it was really okay visit world famous drive through tree
A	ah
B	where?
A	well it's gonna be coming up
B	why why does it say that and then not give you any information?
A	it's gonna be coming up
A	mm
B	but you haven't brought it with you
B	erm
A	drive through tree's coming up
B	do you think they're gonna make us pay to go through it?
A	no
B	I can't bear it
A	it's coming up
A	oh what if there's there might even be like a coffee place
B	a visitor's centre
A	yeah there is
B	drive through

A	do every rose his its thorn
B	where?
A	straight down
B	it's cos the sun's blinding me now now are we driving through the tree first and then having a café and grill?
A	I think have a coffee
B	and then do it
A	then do it cos I think everything'll be better after after that take out dining or take out it's there it's there it's there and it's perfect
B	where shall I park?
A	er in the back in the back
B	yeah but there's no one else parked you don't know what to do

A	oh
B	actually
B	cos like I wasn't sure
A	ah man
B	then we'll come out and like you see what I've done is I've made it so there's no space for anyone on this side so I'll just quickly do a bit better cos I hate it when people do that
