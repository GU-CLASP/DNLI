B	I don't know I'm a bit confused
A	she hasn't
B	everyone says that our maths test is the same as the middle sets
A	um
B	yeah I don't understand it anything she's talking about basically
A	there we go then okay
B	what were we talking about
A	saying um oh yeah I don't understand we were doing that experiment in science and with the chemical reaction and she suddenly said right you need to write this down the mass on an unlit peanut is
B	oh yeah what does that even
A	I don't know I really don't know
B	I don't understand I basically don't understand anything she talks about really

B	oh what happened
A	I don't know and I accidental wrote on the script that infant mortality needs to be higher when you put mortality must be lower and I was like more food will make infant mortality higher and the death rate higher no the life expectancy higher that's wrong

B	so what did he say when you said that
A	well he just corrected it wasn't me that said it it was
B	so you wrote and then

B	ah I'm sad now
A	oh as long as you don't break off the eye
B	no that's what's going to happen well this going to end up as just grim a circle
A	why don't you use a slightly smaller tool

A	what have we got tomorrow? erm
B	what lessons
A	oh yeah I looked it up cos
B	oh yeah we've got English science
A	erm name is going to come and sit with us in science
B	oh it's so awkward whenever she comes
A	I know
B	she always likes talking to you and looks at me like who are you hello and I never know what to say and it's really awkward and I don't like it
A	neither do I it's really because especially as she doesn't know what she's doing
B	yeah
A	and neither do we
B	but then instead of like trying to do something she just sits there
A	yeah
B	and doesn't do it
A	I can't believe
B	I feel sorry for him
A	a bit a bit
B	but then he didn't put any effort into
A	I didn't put any effort into mine
B	well you put more effort than
A	probably not
B	yeah you did
A	but I still managed to get four which is brilliant
B	well it's better than one isn't it
A	yeah still got seven out of four fifteen on my geography assessment
B	what geography?
A	I mean the history assessment
B	oh
A	and I was like I did really badly and
B	what did she get
A	fourteen which is what you got
B	twelve
A	fifteen
B	and I was seven oh well you going to take history
A	yeah even though I'm really awful at it
B	you're not just because you anyway that was just like a tiny little thing
A	yeah but the end of the year I got like a five C and I didn't meet my target for history
B	oh well
A	it was a seven C
B	mm
A	maybe your target's a seven C this year
B	yeah I think it's seven C this year
A	mine's a six A
B	you see
A	mm
B	oh yeah and we haven't even done that much
A	exactly
B	and I missed that lesson you were doing whatever you were doing
A	I was really embarrassed in English because I'd read Private Peaceful but I couldn't remember the name of the main character so
B	what is he called?
A	I can't remember
B	no
A	I'm not sure I can't remember mm
B	oh that's gonna annoy me now cos
A	it is going to annoy me I was thinking the other day your face has changed so much since you were little your face used to be so much more like
B	round and now it's bunchy
A	no it used to be so much more sort of round yeah and now it's sort of
B	yeah now I have a long face
A	you don't have a long face not like
B	I think it's because I've had a retainer and braces
A	yeah
B	they alter your teeth and stuff which are altering the jaw which alters the shape of your face
A	yeah yeah
B	which I think is probably why
A	what are you gonna draw?
B	you
A	okay
B	yeah
A	it isn't really homework to be honest I'm just doing it because I'm a lovely student
B	yeah I'm going to do that as well but not now
A	yeah I've got I don't want I don't want to do the maths test because I'm really really I don't know we have a you know do you have one of the university people in your class
B	no
A	you're really lucky they all come like this time of the year
B	yeah
A	they're like tourists and they teach us but they're not very good so I don't understand what on earth they're talking about
B	yeah like those people in
A	apart from Mr
B	like the woman we have in music
A	I feel really sorry for her because she's not very good
B	like when she knocked over her mug with she flipped I felt really bad for her cos she was really embarrassing and trying to carry on
A	and we were all laughing
B	she's like oh erm and then she just left it she didn't want to
A	Mr
B	yeah
A	oh
B	what
A	I accidentally wrote we will read no we will read a lot and we a lot
B	oh well done what you writing about now
A	how we're going to watch Youtube
B	yup right here
A	which is the right one right cross out all of this and then cross out all of this bit
B	keep moving face and this looks really dodgy
A	sorry
B	this looks nothing like you
A	yup that's really good sorry I think I might rip a page out of my book and then do it on that
B	do what
A	do my write my assessment on that
B	yeah
A	so much easier to do
B	this is just going to turn into a man face
A	isn't it such an achievement when you get halfway through your book
B	yeah
A	work so much easier I love starting a new book cos I'm like right this is going to be clean I'm not going to scribble in it or mess it up
B	yeah
A	and it never turns out like that
B	the first few weeks it does
A	yeah beautiful and then I'm like gosh we do like a really messy activity like a graph or something and it goes wrong oh no I'll have to rewrite the whole thing okay
B	not going to write on the table why do you
B	when did you have miss
A	the supply lady
B	was Mr
A	no he was no the trainee lady
B	oh
A	she was teaching us and Mr
B	that's actually quite good it doesn't look like you though
A	no but never mind
B	looks like a man with big lips
A	I look like a man
B	yeah course funny joke well
A	wasn't that funny
B	anyway so what you're saying
A	and she was really annoying cos she kept putting up her hand and I don't know dying to say the answers that's what she I probably should of got used to that by now cos that's what she's like in maths or any lesson to be honest
B	yeah
A	but she's not in our lessons any more
B	oh yeah cos she
A	so much trouble to do that isn't it
B	to do
A	switch to the other half of the year but still be in the same tutor as this half of the year and to still um
B	yeah I would hate to do that cos then you just have to well actually for her it's fine because she doesn't really care about having friends
A	no
B	but then all your friends are in different lessons
A	yeah
B	and like in your English lesson you have no one you really know
A	exactly I mean if I said I wanted to languages and then they said you're going to have to switch to the other half of the year for all your lessons apart from like maths I'd be like stop it no
B	yeah I would hate to
A	I can understand for like a few lessons but not for everything you'd never get to see your friends
B	yeah I'd hate I wouldn't want to do that
A	I wouldn't want to be in the other half of the year
B	I don't know
A	I don't like the other half
B	neither do I
A	well we don't know them at all
B	yeah
A	well I don't know them like people like
B	yeah people like
A	that's so awkward yeah
B	yeah
A	it's I don't know and then like when you're trying to get everyone to shut up
A	exactly
B	so annoying
A	but it's really awkward because when I walk with her to IT and stuff and erm she's just starts singing and I don't know what to say because I'm like oh you're really good she's like thanks yeah thanks and I'm like oh okay erm and she'll just randomly start singing
B	yeah I think yeah she you stand there you're talking to her and suddenly she starts singing
A	exactly she likes singing that much I think she just coming to choir
B	and that will show her how bad she is but she came once and she just gave up
A	yeah that's what she said to me she was like oh yeah didn't really like it
B	yeah cos you weren't very good
A	the way she sings isn't the way they sing at choir
B	yeah and yeah because she's not very musical
A	no
B	she doesn't really have any idea of timings and
A	yeah I'm really excited to get my ukulele for Christmas well hopefully it will come back into stock we ordered it well we ordered it on Amazon last night and it was out of stock and I really wanted to that was the one with the best reviews and I really
B	what colour is it
A	just like the wood one I really just wanted the normal wood one but that was out of stock so but it's I think it'll come back into stock soon cos the other ones they're in stock and yesterday I was looking at rucksacks for my school bag and I just did not know I found this nice on in Jack Wills
B	are you going to get a school bag for Christmas as well
A	yeah because my one is already falling apart it's not cos only like ten pounds and so it's not I was looking at erm
B	well it probably wasn't ten pounds
A	I think it was twelve pounds yeah the book bags aren't very expensive but the erm
B	but what
A	I was looking on Amazon for bags and I really liked the Jansport bags the Jansport the UK us brand and so I can't ship it cos you have to pay for
B	oh yeah shipping
A	oh miss
B	except you have a bit of a shadow
A	yeah but it would probably be a bit lighter
B	yeah it's really hard to remember what you're talking about when like
A	someone interrupts you
B	yeah and then yeah when someone interrupts you and you have a little conversation and then you ask them and you say what were you going to say I can never remember
A	yeah it's really hard to remember
B	what thing what
A	you know erm that line thing the line by sectors
B	what didn't
A	I don't know
B	oh
A	the words of
B	yeah
A	it's like the worst thing in the world
B	that's good hmm hmm
A	I really need to where did you get these rubbers from are they good rubbers
B	don't know these I got these from Tindalls
A	yeah
B	and I'm not sure I got this from Rymans or something
A	I need to buy some new ones
B	you got this from Tindalls
A	yeah
B	oh I thought that was a school one oh yeah that's slightly thicker
A	it's like the Dager and Rowly graduate sketch book or something
B	huh nice
A	it's not very interesting but I got it cos it was one pound and thought
B	that's good one pound
A	yeah I think it might be one pound thirty
B	well that doesn't really matter
A	oh
B	she's really she's quite spoilt really
A	yeah
B	and she doesn't really treat her mum very well
A	no
B	like she's has massive arguments with her mum
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	so awkward once was on the phone with her once and her and her dad came in no it was her mum and they were just swearing at each other and I was like sitting there
B	awkward
A	yeah
B	yeah in the dark
A	it's already dark
B	do you want a torch
A	no it's fine cos I'm only going down the school bit I'll go down the field
B	dad's picking you up
A	yeah
B	yeah that's the lamppost but be careful cos there's lots of cars at night and
A	okay
B	don't want you to get run over
A	it's not really night yet is it
B	yeah well I don't like being dark so early
A	I know it's like four o'clock and it's already pitch black
B	it's really sad yeah just dark
A	I know
B	as soon as you get home it basically starts turning dark
A	exactly
B	and then you get up wake up in the morning and it's still pitch black
A	exactly
B	I prefer well I was going to say prefer Summer but I do quite like Winter
A	I like Aautumn
B	yeah Aautumn is my favourite season
A	because it doesn't get dark really early
B	Aautumn and Sspring
A	I like I generally like
B	I prefer Aautumn
A	cold or mild
B	I I like hot weather but I don't like really hot weather so but in England you don't really get really
A	I like the hot weather in
B	yeah
A	and it's so humid it makes you want to rip off your skin
B	and some places
A	it's horrible
B	if it's dry and hot it's okay but when it's humid it makes it feel so much hotter
A	I know
B	it makes you feel so much sweatier
A	exactly oh
B	yeah I don't
A	it never really gets like that in England though
B	yeah
A	which is good yeah
B	yeah but I do I like Aautumn because erm you can
A	yeah it's not that hot
B	start wearing scarves and nice cosy jumpers and stuff which I like
A	yeah
B	yeah I like the fires
A	yeah
B	in the winter and
A	yeah
A	I always used to just sit under the radiator with my back on it the radiator was the best thing in the whole world
B	yeah I love hot water bottles and you can go to bed and your hot water bottle
A	yeah
B	tomorrow do you have product design tomorrow
A	yeah think so
B	I have art tomorrow then
A	I've finished my product design clock and so
B	is that miss
A	I glued it back on
B	you've already finished it
A	yeah
B	we haven't really started it
A	tomorrow have to remember actually I need to remember to bring in some paint to paint my clock
B	oh yeah what paint are you going to bring in
A	acrylic I think but my acrylics were I don't know I don't really want to take them in cos
B	why
A	they're quite expensive
B	well just don't let anyone else see it is that why you're worried cos someone else use it
A	no because I feel like I'll leave it somewhere and it'll get squished
B	so yeah you just need to make sure that no one uses your acrylics
A	maybe Ill try and find I did have some cheap ones I got from
B	what acrylics?
A	hmm from like the work or something but I got some other ones cos I didn't like those that much but they they should be aright on painting wood I can use them up
B	yeah I'm just going to bring in I'm just going to paint mine white so I'm going to bring in some tiger acrylic
A	I'm going to paint one of those I'm going to be ambitious painting it
B	what colour
A	blue
B	blue to light blue
A	and my plastic's blue and stuff I came over my design fault you know what was going to happen I made a circle out of plastic
B	what so you've already stuck the thing on and then you're going to paint it
A	yeah
B	okay but you're not going to paint the plastic
A	no
B	so sort of paint around the plastic
A	yeah
B	and paint
A	have lots of fun with that the wood isn't all out of the plastic it's like a fan outside it but I've made it a circle out of plastic and then I made four triangles out of the wood and I was planning to stick them on the plastic and have the clock mechanism coming up out of the bottom then I realised that the hands of the clock won't go over the wood
B	oh yeah
A	and so
B	that's a problem I have so I need to move
A	so I thought what I was going to have to do was sand down the wood until it's like paper thin and stick it but then I thought it's gonna
B	yeah
A	so what I decided to do was chop off basically all of my wood half of my wood and stick it at the back instead it's looks okay now but once Mr
B	like he snapped yours off
A	yeah but
B	hmm
A	but he said but whoever had finished we might be able to do an amplifier
B	what do you mean
A	the ones that you plug into your phone and it makes the music louder
B	oh yeah
A	but like a non battery powered amplifier
B	oh yeah
A	sounds really
B	I want one of those
A	cool and I wanna make it but he was like well don't rush because I've said that um even though it is really really cool I don't want rushed work
B	yeah how can hmm that is cool though cool yeah I've got one of those they're like those big horn things
A	yeah I think
B	hmm that's quite cool
A	have you done the um inking yet
B	oh yeah I did today well we did last lesson but I went to my clarinet lesson so
A	you didn't get to do it
B	but we did today
A	did you finish them
B	um no
A	oh
B	well I did two of them
A	yeah
B	but then my other two people don't have any heads on them so cos we didn't get time
A	mine ended up really rubbish cos I drew them absolutely huge so I could only fit one on a page and erm so and she was saying how we should ink it so that one of them looks more in front and one of them looks more behind but
B	oh yeah
A	but I couldn't do that cos I didn't have them on the same page so it was a bit of a fail
B	well I'm sure it still looks really good
A	it doesn't really
B	I'm sure it does you're just saying that maybe you don't think it looks good
A	I don't think it
B	but I do
A	does but you haven't seen it
B	yeah well I think when I seen it I'll think it looks good
A	and then I thought I'm so bad I so I'm glad I found my artwork cos she was really angry with everyone who forgot their art book actually I don't think she was having a very good day
B	when was that
A	um Monday
B	oh
A	cos we have her last lesson and she was like I'm just going to warn you I'm having a horrible day
B	well
A	it's really good but
B	it doesn't like
A	it doesn't look like me it actually looks a bit like a boy in a good way
B	in a good way
A	yeah I mean it looks like a
B	the nose kind of looks like yours
A	oh thanks it's like me everyone says I has big eyes and look how small you've drawn my eyes
B	yeah you're looking down
A	I look a bit like I've got a sort of weird haircut going on here
B	but I couldn't
A	I like the eyebrows they're good you like my ballerina picture cos look at her legs they're awful
B	they're not
A	like a sausage
B	hmm
A	just like the scotch egg dale had food people I wonder what they're actually doing their designs are and stuff
B	yeah
A	I Mr
B	yeah he came into our maths class as well
A	and he looked at me and he said who's taking part in the dale thingy I didn't put my hand up and he was like
B	yeah
A	cooking
B	I kind of enjoy the designing bit but I wouldn't like to cooking and stuff
A	well I don't know what they've done with my homework but I tried really hard on that
B	yeah
A	harder to
B	I don't know how they did they how they chose people because yeah it's not really
A	fair
B	I don't know like how come
A	isn't it quite funny
A	but isn't it quite funny Miss
B	did
A	yeah I think so and me you and
B	yeah but then yeah
A	maybe um Miss was a bit bias
B	bias towards people who did food tech
A	how much are you meant to write for this first Spanish lesson
B	I think she said a page
A	okay
B	or something like that what time is it
A	I think I should leave soon
