A	mm
C	I'll die if I don't have food
A	well you won't that's a gross exaggeration isn't it?
C	it's a very light exaggeration
A	sit down
C	okay I'll be tortured if I didn't have food
A	I have to say I'm glad we stopped watching the Bake Off last night
A	it was torture watching all these amazing things being created and us not eating anything
B	yeah
C	I remember watching Bake Off and we were like mum I'm hungry
B	and you were like sorry but you can't have anything with your
C	and you were like it's nearly it's nearly bedtime you're not allowed anything
A	well you weren't hungry but your eyes were looking at things and your brain was thinking I would like some of that and some of that and some of that
C	but it does make you hungry
A	it doesn't make you hungry it makes you want something that's a very different thing isn't it?
B	yeah
C	although I was actually quite hungry
A	no you weren't you had loads of food you had two cakes each yesterday
C	no I mean like when we were watching Bake Off
A	yeah but you had lots and lots and lots of food yesterday
C	yeah but when we were watching Great British Bake Off
A	mm well I do think therefore that if we make the marble cake erm straight after lunch
B	then we'll be able to eat it while we're watching that
A	mm
B	mm mm yum yum yum
A	if you just the main thing with a marble cake is that you don't overmix it
B	yeah
A	that and then it has that lovely effect
C	yeah
B	if you do overmix it it won't be very nice
A	mm so for my last meal I would have
B	marshmallows
A	yes I mean normally
A	so I don't normally have sugary things
C	but
A	cos it makes me feel ill but but it wouldn't matter cos I would be dying so I would have
C	yeah although mum
A	yeah
C	you wouldn't be allergic to anything if you had a last meal
A	oh I
C	yeah
A	yeah but I've kind of gone off all of that food now erm I would have all the things
C	tiger bread
A	stop talking about what I'm I'm gonna tell you no I would have all the food that I like now so avocado and tomato and my lactose-free cheese and my gluten-free bread and proper butter which I don't normally have and I would have some olives and some dates cos I love dates loads and erm
C	I find dates interesting
A	mm?
C	cos I was born in two thousand and six and now it's two thousand and sixteen
A	oh good grief that took me ages to get what you were talking about then
B	now
A	what?
C	no not
C	yeah
A	is that what she was saying that she fights she finds dates interesting?
C	mm
B	yeah and
B	all I have now is an empty is a useless packet of dates and she was eating dates
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	was it funny? mm
C	although there was something very clever
A	mm?
C	that her mum er I've forgotten you'll have to ask I'll have to ask dad to tell you but there were odds about something that was something like the fact that one hundred thousand to one
A	about what though?
C	dates
A	oh okay
C	as in two thousand and six
A	mm
C	nineteen eighty-five
A	what?

C	yes
A	okay
C	yeah
B	mm
C	next
B	not as old as granny who was actually invited

B	yeah
A	you just had desserts anyway my last meal
B	it
A	it was a buffet? I love the way you say buffet

A	so it's not a person maybe I will marry one we'd be very happy
C	do you mum take almond butter to be your lovely wife? you're gay
A	cos I'd want to get another one so I don't think I will marry an er a jar of almond butter
A	I mean I don't love almond butter as much as I love dates I would marry an everlasting supply of dates
B	but mum it wouldn't be everlasting cos you would die
C	and do you
C	to be your lovely wife?
A	so long as they're Medjool dates which are the best ones yes

A	I think being gay is the least of my worries
C	and
A	if I've married a box of dates
C	and now you will kiss the dates
A	how do you
C	because it's your because the dates are from Morocco and a lady picked them
A	right so if a man picked them would that make them male?
A	right brilliant I'm er I'm all clear now
C	and because they put them in a and because just because we put them in a dress
B	and
A	what? the box is in the dress? or the little dates are in dresses?
C	the box is in a dress and all the little dates are in bow ties
