A	it's it's not a lot I'm not gonna have this conversation
D	cos I I end up I end up helping any like er I end up in that situation kind of feeling like oh my god I should do and in a way it's better if like
A	mm mm
B	but
B	maybe they do
A	they they er have got to just be careful they don't duck each other
B	I beg your pardon?
A	erm
B	I know
A	to Peppa I've I've put on fifty-six minutes of it erm
D	mm
A	but but anyhow they're coming on Thursday
D	how long for?
A	a couple of hours in the morning
B	mm
D	okay
B	when's
D	he's er he we'll be here late on
A	mm
B	late on Sunday
D	yeah
A	yeah
A	and he's going up to Scotland with you? is he?
D	yep
D	mm
B	when are you going up?
A	erm
D	erm we're going up to Scotland on the fifth
B	which family are you going to see?
D	we're gonna stay er with
B	right
D	so we're gonna go straight to
A	you're going to
D	yeah on the way
A	so are you going up by train?
B	mm
D	going up by train and er
A	mm
D	on my own it's just too much
A	so are the girls going?
B	will you spend the night at
D	no
B	mm
D	because I'm gonna erm go straight to they actually can't erm
B	can't accommodate
D	they're
B	mm
D	erm
B	yeah
D	better the first one is a lunch and then you know
A	mm yeah
D	I mean I feel a bit bad it can't be longer but you know I was gonna go up
B	mm
D	er to
B	how long will you be in
D	mm?
B	just one
D	erm one night in
B	mm
D	cos then they're going off to erm on holiday themselves and then er erm mm I'm going to take off
A	that actually would be really nice
B	yeah you won't have
A	mm mm
D	yeah I think it'd be really I mm
D	no I won't have
B	no
A	so
D	no
A	oh he's not going up?
D	no
A	oh
D	the original plan was that he would come up and maybe like one of the girls or something but that it just didn't get arranged soon enough it was all kind of
A	mm mm
D	and actually
A	yes that's what I thought it was yes
D	yeah
A	mm
D	and then perhaps put us on the insurance on the car and
A	mm
D	but it just because the flights back from
A	right
D	if you leave them any
D	I mean it's it was quite expensive for them even on the Ryanair flights here it was er
A	mm mm
D	three hundred euros plus for them to just come to
A	it's a lot of money that erm yeah erm
D	and that's not including
A	of course he's over two two now that's right mm
D	mm yeah so anyway we thought that this was the kind of erm the easiest way
A	does he does you pay two half price or just?
D	no
A	do children go?
D	no he pays full it's just full price
A	they're all full price?
D	yeah
A	children don't get a children's ticket?
D	no no not on Ryanair no
A	oh my goodness
B	because they take up a whole seat presumably?
D	yeah
B	that's the concept
D	and when they sit on your lap there was a kind of flat fee of thirty thirty quid or something thirty euros
B	mm
D	so they even paid then
A	it's erm it gets so complicated I am so glad really
D	yeah yeah
A	that I don't have to sort of erm even go near that side of life erm
D	yeah
A	it was bad enough trying to take all of you up
D	yeah
A	on a train once a year
D	yeah
A	when you've got the family railcard and each child went for a pound
D	yeah
A	er return it was fantastic
D	yeah
A	but erm but no erm
D	yeah no I've got I've I
A	of course mm
D	cos even just going to
A	mm
D	it would've cost nearly seventy pounds just for just for one journey with us and the girls
B	mm
D	but it I mean it could cost nearly that if we bought travel cards for them even with a rail card
A	of course mm I think I made a mistake with
D	oh yeah don't yeah don't worry it's a month before isn't it?
D	yeah
A	I thought but that there wasn't a a number beside that and I thought
D	yeah yeah
A	so I scribbled off this card
D	yeah
A	she must've thought it was very odd
D	yeah
A	erm but
D	yes
A	I will apologise when she comes
D	oh no don't worry I haven't given it to her yet so
A	oh you haven't given it to her? oh good
D	yeah yeah I'll just save it for her
A	mm mm
D	cos it could still be she
A	mm
D	yeah
A	yes yes
D	but no she's not been back yet so but er
A	mm
D	I I usually get erm some not usually but for some of them I've got cards I
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	so I've got one for her
D	they're coming in a few weeks anyway just I'll just give them at the same time
D	but no that you think of their birthdays at all I think is lovely
A	mm no I just er it's only when when I when I flipped it over and I thought ah that was the most peculiar thing
A	and er and I thought oh I'm really up erm to date you know cos I've got it all sort of sussed out
D	yeah she'll be nineteen
A	yes nineteen
A	that is actually quite grown up
D	yeah
A	yes
D	you'd hope yeah
D	well I mean I erm I met her when she was thirteen
A	mm yeah
D	mm
D	and
B	yeah
D	oh yeah yeah
A	she's really you know in her fifteenth year but erm
D	yeah
A	I'll give you a drop more if you like darling
D	no I'm fine actually
A	oh
D	cos I've been snacking I've
A	mm
D	trying to eat the summer I try
A	oh and how did that? you that was for this
A	was it just for the swimming? cos it sounds absolutely fantastic
A	are there is there what is there to do in
D	er nothing well there's a green outside but he doesn't
A	mm
D	doesn't really get on with the other people there
A	yeah
D	unfortunately
A	mm
A	mm
D	that would be him sorted
A	absolutely
D	for most of the summer
A	mm
D	and there's a big
A	mm
D	they could come round
A	mm yeah
D	and the the trouble is that there's a couple of mean kids and they
D	do you know what I mean? cos there's a couple of kids who I know are lovely and their parents are lovely but they hang around with the mean kids whose actual
D	not nice kids
D	I can tell you god knows what that was about
A	mm
D	he was in erm
A	mm
D	about it but
A	so what do the do the girls do?
D	the girls stay at home on their computers
A	right
D	that's what they do erm
A	what age is
D	er she's seventeen now I think yes
A	mm
D	I get a bit sort of I keep I I just about remember their ages just before they move up one so I'm always a bit kind of
A	mm
D	erm
A	that's
D	shall I get it
D	I'll get it
B	it's just from the
D	okay
A	there there's actually a towel just hanging outside in the hall darling
B	is there? oh
A	should be
A	I haven't packed it away yet
D	but yeah
B	mm
A	to go where?
D	to go on these like camps
A	oh right right mm
D	or do like the girls used to be able to have those options but erm
A	mm
D	but erm so I don't know
A	the one that she had this
D	yes
D	she's still got that one
D	I think it's all a bit on and off but it's
D	me well me too I didn't even realise they were still like together
D	the gossip chain I
B	we'd er heard that they'd split up hadn't we? somewhere hadn't we?
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	I think I think they are
A	mm
D	but he's he's a very kind man
A	mm mm
D	and he's very kind of very amenable kind of man er and
A	right
D	and
B	what in?
A	do you mean erm in
B	in his company?
D	he works I think he works in I think it's property but I'm not totally sure could be something else it's er it's something like that office job
A	but it's but it's not?
D	in
A	so
D	she went to
A	oh fantastic oh right
D	but the but they but
A	right right
D	and erm so she went over and worked for him for two weeks
A	oh
D	and then we er
D	probably cost more than any work she'd've done so but he's such a nice
A	mm mm
D	he's such a nice man but
D	very very generous man actually
A	yeah
A	mm
D	er that er so she so she's gone away done that come back
A	mm
D	gone away to her camp you know so
A	oh lovely
B	mm
A	mm
D	so I mean she's had er quite a
A	she's had a good summer
D	she's had a good summer yeah
B	mm
D	so
A	right
D	so they've had that too
A	right
D	but no the girls don't really I think erm
A	mm
D	she's er keen on that side yeah that's what
B	mm
D	what she likes more than more than the rest but she's she's done her Leaving Cert now so she'll have her results very soon
B	mm
D	and they're the big ones
A	and that's going to give her
D	yeah
D	yeah
A	well that was lovely
B	mm
A	er I really enjoyed that I'll be back in a minute
D	but yeah there's not there's not loads erm going on I mean I suppose it depends what you do some of the some of erm
B	mm
B	right
D	and the other one I don't know what he does he seems to just sit inside with his history books
B	are these are these boys at his school
D	so he's er he's friends with erm a couple of like raggle-taggle ones they're from all over the world one of them's Portuguese
D	the other one's American there's
D	even though he moved up with local boys from the primary school
D	and funnily enough for somebody as sociable as

D	mm
D	do you want me to do that outside door?
B	I I'm really erm
D	really hot
B	er I'm I'm really

D	yeah
B	my father didn't erm er I mean yes I
D	yeah
B	and he's er
A	but it's nicer the other end of life although you get
B	precisely exactly you were
A	you know you're bothered when you're a teenager
D	yeah
A	but when you get to sort of older end of life you look
D	which lasts
A	that's right teenage years is just
B	that's er that's right er er
B	no er I mean I used to erm erm er actually there was a time
D	really?
B	and er they used to the the headmaster used to call out and say
D	oh right
A	yes
B	and erm er
A	yes
B	because I'm
A	yes
D	yeah
B	I know immediately
D	yeah
B	that I'm not er and I
D	oh
B	I was never made a school prefect
D	oh no
B	and erm
A	cos

A	I'm afraid so
B	in fact they erm er I think somebody rang up er there there was a board which gave you erm permission to

B	but er I think somebody somebody somebody rang
A	that was for
B	the national service
D	yeah
B	somebody rang up the erm
D	yeah
B	er I mean my my voice didn't break till I was seventeen
D	yeah oh oh really?
B	er I was still I could still sing actually
D	yeah
B	er either treble or baritone
D	yeah

D	yeah
B	and erm
B	but the other people I mean er what's his name? erm
D	Aled Jones
B	no erm
B	erm no erm his voice broke fairly normally
D	oh okay
B	but er he he was didn't er he could still sing treble at fifteen I think but he er he
D	yeah
B	no erm what what's the
A	erm Coe
B	er Seb Seb Coe
A	mm
B	Seb Coe was similar apparently
D	mm
B	erm and it's it's interesting because
D	yeah
B	your
D	yeah
B	er your legs and your arms I have a ridiculously short body
D	oh
B	er ridiculously short
D	right
B	er and erm er
D	yeah
D	oh really?
B	he if he sits er erm when he used to sit in my car
D	interesting yeah
B	erm he er
B	erm if I took over the thing I I had to put the the rear mirror down
B	actually er er
B	for for
D	short legs long body
B	and er er yeah he's got short stumpy legs
D	ah
A	excuse me he's just got shorter legs than you
B	which erm
D	oh right
B	cos you have a low centre of gravity
D	yeah yeah you can't have these like
A	mm
D	tall gangly ones
B	you you you
D	waving about in the breeze
B	you get some gangly ones have done they've done fine Peter Crouch for instance is six foot three
D	yeah right
B	as a striker I mean he's done fine
D	yeah
B	but some gangly ones are alright but not very many
D	yeah
B	and er particularly midfielders and this sort of thing they like
D	yeah you need to be able to zip around
B	Maradona was five foot seven Pelé was five foot seven er
D	you know I erm I was in the same
B	oh really?
D	actually they used to come and play football on the beach and
B	mm
D	really? no I can't really I can't see a thing
B	and he he wasn't tall was he?
D	no he was very
D	actually quite small mm yeah
B	yeah and erm
D	no he's not
A	but with
B	and they can turn quickly they can they're they're much more deft with their feet
D	yeah yeah
B	and erm
A	but with with
B	but
A	mm
D	yeah
D	oh okay oh that's interesting
B	because erm the erm good long legs and
A	but with
D	yeah
A	erm we don't know we know he's coming to stay
B	yeah yeah here's the point about
D	yeah
B	what we
D	yeah the details are yet to yeah
A	mm
B	the thing is that what's happened is that
D	okay yeah
B	erm and erm so you see he he's in an awkward period
D	yeah
B	because he's got
D	oh yeah
B	cos er although you see he was er earning quite a lot last year
D	yeah
B	and of course the the amount you have to pay for your children
D	yeah
B	depends on how much you were earning last year not how much you're earning this year
D	oh yes of course right oh
B	and erm and so they er they've got to pay quite a lot for that
A	mm
B	and erm so er he er
B	but but she now
B	she she
D	yeah
B	and er she
B	and she she she she
A	absolutely we did
B	absolutely she's about five years younger than
D	but you know lots of people would not pick themselves up and thought about what they can do and just go
A	yeah
B	by the time by the time by er she's got a job in
B	which is er in the
D	oh
B	the industrial part of Germany
D	oh right
B	erm the part which we were bombing the hell out of during the war
D	right
B	and erm she she was erm she she er she er and so
A	for five years five or six years
B	until until er all the erm
A	pensions
B	pensions come in you see
D	so they've got five year sort of period
B	er he his
A	mm
D	yeah
B	actually they're
A	they're they're they're staggering the er the
B	erm they're
A	the change
D	oh
B	in in age
A	because it used be sixty for a woman sixty-five for a man
D	oh right oh right oh I see
B	so he's got he's got not quite
A	now they've both they're both now
B	but of course she is significantly younger
D	yeah
B	erm she's about five years younger than him I think
D	yeah
A	I think so mm
B	and so erm if she erm when they get all their pensions coming in
D	yeah
B	er they'll be fine
D	okay
D	I suppose that's nice for them to know they're not in this kind of my god we've got years and then what do we then?
A	mm mm
B	er but they've got they've got to fill fill up the the time in the meantime
D	yeah
B	and so
D	mm
B	she's gone going out to teach in
D	yeah
B	erm and will be paid for that
D	yes
B	he's going to go with her
D	yeah
B	which he and
D	yeah
B	with the Dutch people he'd be able to pick it up very quickly
D	yeah
B	I mean
D	but that's still
A	yes
B	yeah yeah erm so but erm er
B	so what they've they've er done
D	yeah
B	is to rent their house
D	yeah
B	their own house erm it's slightly less than they would be getting if he was in
A	I think it'll be
B	but but but no it's er er it's I think he's getting about thirteen hundred
A	I no they put it up for thirteen hundred
B	so he's getting twelve hundred
A	thirteen hundred a month
D	yeah
B	but but but but the
B	man paid up front
A	and he said I will give you a year's up front right?
D	that's worth it
A	but I want it at twelve hundred
D	I'd take that
A	not at thirteen hundred
D	I'd I'd take that as a landlord yeah
D	it's not like they're saying a lot of Russian people have been doing that for some reason
D	okay
B	cos he's
D	oh
B	so they
D	yeah
B	so they will be living on income from that and then erm
A	no
D	oh well that that's that's good for them too
B	I mean
A	yeah
D	mm
B	and erm it's erm erm I mean they've got enough money to pay it off it's just a question that erm
B	er they they they might prefer to to to to take
B	well I thought it was very panicked
D	oh oh right
D	yeah mm yeah
B	and they hadn't thought it through but then and they
D	yeah
B	in the north of England or something like that
B	mm
A	well what I find very interesting about it my love
D	yeah yeah
A	is that yes they had to think through how to get X amount of pounds that they needed
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm over erm a five to six year period
D	yeah
A	erm and they thought and er er
B	well of course once
D	yeah
A	mm
D	mm
