A	yeah let's carry on now
B	okay
A	yeah it's recording now
B	yeah it is okay
A	ah well
B	that sounds amazing doesn't it
A	where they all dress up
B	yeah
A	yeah it should be
B	but I think used Victorian coins
A	no they
A	oh
B	that will be good
A	yes yes
B	I think I'm going to use that and write about it
A	that's a good idea
B	yeah
A	but it's it's famous for being you know in the heartland of industrial revolution and er it all is grassy and sort of pleasant that it looks now
B	really? Yeah I think it will be very interesting
A	oh that reminds me don't let me forget that next this year is the anniversary of that steam engine down the road
B	yes
A	it's a good reason to try and submit an article
B	you should yeah
A	yeah that would go well in there
B	it is in  wasn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	oh right okay here's a question for you
A	hmm
B	I know very very little about it I'm ashamed to say
A	something about inalienable rights to er life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
B	mm mm
A	along those lines anyway
B	mm mm
A	which otherwise you'd just be back into slavery
B	so is federal the whole country?
A	yeah federal is the whole country
B	right
A	so there's  there's a  there's a thing in the original Constitution that allows erm it says and there are mustn't be any laws between the states that restrict trade
B	mm mm
A	but they've taken them that to mean the negative which means the federal system can make laws because it's not a state
B	right
A	so they've twisted the Constitution in order to fit it in with Socialist type ideas with which I obviously don't agree
B	mm
A	so to be true to what the original people of the Constitution said I think we should put in a thing about property and make trade erm free
B	hmm
A	why? What's the what's important about having one do you think? Why do you miss it?
B	well from what I understand from you is what you've just said that you know there is  there is  that  that a  that a citizen can can kind of
A	yep
B	and I was thinking this morning for some reason I'm not quite sure why
A	mm
B	and I've heard this too many times for it not for me not to believe it's correct that that you can smoke in the bar of the House of Commons
A	I know it's outrageous isn't it
B	yeah I know
A	oh yeah
B	but then I heard it again and how could you and that is just so much like you know one rule for us and one rule for you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they'll happily put up with it
B	okay here's another one
A	oh go on then as long  as long  as we both as long as I get to hear your answer as well
B	well I just think well I know you're not going to approve of this but I think this is quite funny
A	uh-oh
B	right
A	well obviously I'd have a  have a  a heart with an arrow through it and it would say A for R or R for A or something like that
B	okay
A	and I'd have it somewhere so that you could see it but it wasn't too painful wasn't too large and erm I'm not quite sure
A	traditionally men have it on their arms
B	could you get a dot? And that would be your tattoo
A	no no
B	A dot you could pretend it was erm a beauty spot
A	yeah I would want to get something that you know if I was going to
B	yeah
A	and I can't think what it's for I mean why? It just looks odd
B	I think if you're  if you're  well I was going to say if you were young but if you have well-muscled arms then they sort of I suppose they sort of showcase them
A	mm
B	but you'd have to keep your arms well-muscled
A	oh is it like if you have pictures of snake and then you sort of
B	well I think there are you can get tattoos that are very very clever and I think they like I've heard of someone having a panther on their leg and when they  when they  run it looks like the panther's running
A	oh okay
B	which is it's kind of clever but the trouble is that if you're very honed and toned you've got to stay like that otherwise it's going to look horrible isn't it
A	Cos it the panther would get a bit fat won't it
B	but I was thinking if I had to have one erm I would you could  you could  either go for the well okay I've got to get one so I'll have to
A	Obtrusive
B	yeah unobtrusive as possible
A	oh there you go like a motto
B	like yeah like something carpa diem but a bit more than that
A	oh okay
B	and and then I thought well you'd have to have it then so you could see it all the time
A	oh okay
B	yeah I'm not
A	it's a marriage of slavery actually
B	yes
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah well
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	let's see what's on this list
B	hmm mm mm
A	oh
B	because you can up with something like hunger
A	mm
B	but if you take a country like Africa with the person who's listening to this
A	they'd stopped listening a long time ago
B	I know
A	hmm mm
B	like for example erm and I know it sounds very arrogant and it's not meant to but erm I think it was two-thousand eight when there was erm oh there was some well anniversary's totally the wrong word but there was
A	mm
B	and there was another big sort of charity erm drive to get money to Africa
A	oh I remember it yeah
B	and there was a program about AIDS in Africa and it was sort of saying how much of a problem it was and as I was watching it I it was saying you know how many people died of AIDS blah blah blah and I temporarily forgot that the Western world doesn't have a cure for AIDS either
A	mm
B	but Africa hasn't managed to do that and I think it's down to beliefs
A	yeah
B	so yeah I would say and that's just one example
A	well what I take that from that
B	no that's fine
A	but is it would lead on to what I would say which is basically it's erm the biggest problem facing the world is a lack of rationality
B	yeah
A	or you know you could say the fiscal crisis that we're in is erm down to lack of rationality as well
B	mm
A	pretending things are the case when they you know they're not
B	yeah
A	we're evading the need to try and figure out whether they are true or not
B	yeah
A	that's a symptom though
B	yeah it is
A	oh yeah
B	and it's about I think if you really want to help someone you've got to help them
A	mm mm
B	it's like you know the maxim erm give the man a fish and you feed him for a day
A	yeah
B	I think that's true
A	so if there was a way to
A	yeah but that's how you've would achieve it
B	yeah
A	let's have the  let's have the  other one for a change because we've been very deep already
B	the easy one
A	yeah
B	what makes a house a home?
A	oh that's a good one
B	mm
A	you know the things that you put in place aren't just there for utilitarian purposes if you were say sharing a flat or you were in a barracks you know there's your suit there's your knife and fork there's your blanket
B	mm
A	no we've chosen things because they're what we value
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's been chosen by us and and erm yeah so there's obviously photos which are very personal but then there's pictures that we've chosen cos erm flowers that we've chosen
A	furniture
B	yeah there's furniture that we've chosen and and it's they all reflect to a greater or lesser extent our taste and our what we like
A	it's like an extension of yourself in a way isn't it? The house
B	yeah
A	I suppose that's what it is
B	I find it really really odd when I walk into people's houses and there's no
A	oh stark places right yeah I know
B	yeah but there's like no it's no reflection of them it's just it it seems to be
A	like a show home you mean
B	I'm not sure I mean I think sometimes you can get a sort of you can get that show home effect but but more I would say erm don't need to determine is the right word but there's no sort of any any
A	mm
B	I find it odd going to people's house when there's absolutely no attempt to sort of style or or colour or but then that's quite important to me so
A	mm
B	but you like it though don't you?
A	oh I love it and I wouldn't say that I was totally ignorant  of the  of the need for it but certainly didn't have the skills and arrangement ideas of how to arrange colours and so on like you have
A	we put the two together and you've got the best er best of both worlds hopefully
A	no
B	oh
A	okay that's all I was going to say on that one
B	okay
A	oh I'll pick one
B	you you pick one
A	erm oh we've done that one
A	mm
B	and then you get a lovely breakfast brought to your room and so you put on a nice fluffy robe and you go and have your breakfast and you sit there
A	would it  would it  have a balcony maybe that you could sit on outside in the sun in private?
B	oh yes
A	oh yes
B	oh yes and you might get because it might be a special occasion you might get a little glass of fizz with your breakfast
A	oh okay it's never to early to start with that
B	and then you know sometimes it's a tricky one sometimes it's nice to have things planned but then sometimes I can really enjoy just not having any specific agenda and just sort of erm
A	mm
B	so it wouldn't be  it wouldn't be  totally devoid of doing stuff
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	what do you think? What's your perfect day?
A	it's a good question
B	thank you my love
A	but we can't repeat that I don't think that's what the question's exactly about except we might renew our vows but that's you know that's another occasion
B	yeah
A	er yes it's sort of a day you could  you could  have you know by design as opposed to say things that happen very rarely
B	yeah you know what we're I was thinking we're it's ages since I've we've been to a spa
A	it is rather
B	no it's not
A	yeah but that's the reason why it's exclusive you see
A	but it's got wonderful facilities there
B	it does
B	yeah
A	oh good
B	yeah
A	you know and then just drowning yourself in the book in a sense
B	okay
A	you know no I mean figuratively
B	mm
A	so you just immerse yourself is the word sorry not drown
B	the trouble is with
A	you don't like the food do you
B	so we should erm
A	or the popcorn in the cinema
B	yeah I don't mind the food in the er spa place though
A	yeah
B	but we should there's a new place near
A	oh towards the erm The New Forest or in The New Forest
B	it's at
A	oh
B	probably yeah
A	but that might be a good opportunity to go there because it's so expensive otherwise
B	mm
A	is there a spa there? At
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	I do also enjoy days when you have planned loads and you get loads achieved and you come home and think did we really manage to do all that?
B	yeah
A	but as the mood takes you at the moment yeah I would go for the more relaxing one but
B	mm
A	yeah there is something good about change is as good as a rest
B	mm
A	but there are only so many cities like that that you actually go to so I'd find us more of those probably
B	mm
A	it's just that they're really impressive
B	would you? Yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	anyway that's our twenty-two minutes that will do for now I think
B	is it?
