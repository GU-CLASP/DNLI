A	for an idea
B	I think you are right I
B	no I don't I've got erm a list here that
A	yeah
B	or an hour and a half I don't mind but I just thought a total of five hours' driving in a a day is a bit mental really
A	uhu
unknown_female	at the end of the road turn right
A	thanks Simon
B	thanks Simon
A	thanks
A	erm I really wasn't going to go because I felt oh well you know ten thirty is still kind of early for the holidays you don't need to go but I woke up at a quarter past seven and oh I'm awake I'll go to the gym I think I woke up
B	no
A	no for the night
B	oh good
A	yeah they are staying in a hostel that someone found online or recommended to them
B	cool
A	erm
A	no no they are not going skiing they are just going
B	oh
A	yeah look
B	have you been in it?
A	no
B	we will have to try that
A	because I don't know whether it's you know just a very nice looking erm kebab shop
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	but I think it you know it looks quite nice inside so we'll see
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I've got a fair few
A	I'm sweating I might have to undress once I get to
B	yeah
A	me too
A	is that
B	okay cool where's that then?
A	it says it's like north
B	oh hang on
A	north somewhere
B	okay
A	I can't tell you anything more than that I can't even find it on the map so the place is
B	is it north?
A	aha
B	yeah the place that we were going to go to
A	yeah it is in
B	I know
A	yeah I know because
B	yeah
A	oh shall we go to Poland's oldest salt mine in
B	yes let's do that it's funny you should say that I was thinking about
A	because it's really close
B	well now I don't know that is I think the erm that gives grid references to a map that I don't have which is annoying you can do pages and stuff but this one five two seventeen business not a bloody notion mate
A	erm the mine's largest cavern the
B	oh
A	well or well where else is there? but yeah I just thought
A	and it's not even
B	no and it's on an A road
A	forty-five minutes
B	so yeah
A	okay great
B	yeah
A	well we live where would you say? like I would say like one five two-ish
B	oh where did you get that map?
A	it was just there
B	oh I was looking for the map I couldn't find it
A	so one five two
B	I know it hasn't actually got any roads or anything useful on it
A	one five three that's us oh okay so the closest thing on the map is one hundred and forty-six
B	oh there's a shitload of wooden churches around here
A	yeah which is
B	no
A	oh
B	and that's erm between
A	mm
B	I think once you've seen one wooden church you've seen every wooden church
A	one hundred and fifty-six is er renaissance residence perfectly preserved oh this is
B	oh yeah
A	is it sumptuous late renaissance magnet magnate residence from the turn of the sixteenth century
A	the choice is yours today
B	no wonder people were invading Poland
A	one hundred and thirty-seven this isn't
B	indeed
A	one three four is what?
B	get in the right lane
A	yeah be ready to turn left I think is
B	yeah it's a little bit ah pick a lane mind the pedestrians the light might be red it might be green it might be your light it might not be
A	keep driving just pretend you are in a video game where it doesn't matter
B	go go go
A	no and then
B	oh my god
A	it's not reality
A	I didn't go like bumper to bumper with a police car and then waiting for them to turn around and then drive off
B	okay
A	no I'm not that bad one hundred and thirty-six
A	right we are getting
B	I thought that was a policeman who is reading a map but of course I'm looking at the passenger
A	he doesn't know where he's going
B	he doesn't he needs
A	one hundred and thirty-six is there and that is
B	yeah every time
A	that's nice one hundred and thirty-five
B	every time I go past
A	yeah
B	I just don't want to drive for five hours today
A	no yeah
B	yeah I think it's all relative as well it depends on erm what sort of roads you've got if you've got little wiggly woggly ones then it can be really close but take forever
A	I think
B	mm
A	it is in the carpark no it's not it's in a place that I can't pronounce
B	okay
A	I know that it has got a beautiful square it's like a little
A	er
B	I like the sound of that
A	er I'm supposed to make all the decisions
B	it sounds like it's got everything
A	I think it would be nice for the day
B	and I think if it's south of here it's going to have beautiful scenery as well
A	it's not south it's north
B	what? is it?
A	yeah I just don't think it's on this map because it's in
B	ah okay
A	but if you want to stay if you want to go south then
B	oh shit that's where I should have turned oh done it again
A	dammit
B	oh can I turn here? now which what is that no entry sign? maybe that's for me
A	I think
B	I'll turn around here again like we did the other day oh well at least I know I can turn around here
A	so if we go south then the next one south is one hundred and forty-six which is one of the churches
B	I don't mind going north alright
A	or one five seven what's that? one five seven is
B	no
A	you've already said no to that
B	I know I think that just needs just striking off who is interested apart from George Bush?
A	I need a pen and then I can edit this
B	I've got erm I've got pens in my bag
A	but then if we go too far south we are just you know in Slovakia one sixty what's that? palace music and oh that's
B	what's going on there? right
A	one six two here that's churches
B	I need to reverse out again
A	one hundred and fifty-eight
B	castle and park complex that does look nice
A	one five eight
B	you see I like the sound of the place that we were going to go miles away because I like the sound of the grounds and everything
A	yeah
B	okay
A	I don't know how you say it or yeah that's as far as I've got
B	okay
A	we will have to rely on the satnav because of this map
B	no the satnav is good
A	because I've just run out of map
B	that was quite simply negotiated I think we've got quite good at things like that
A	well I don't think it was negotiated it was me just going well we are going to go here so
B	okay fair enough no you did come up with a few options there
A	well and yeah from a selfish perspective I've always wanted to go
B	what to this
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I've never heard of it
A	and people have recommended it to me before but to get to on public transport you've either got to go to
B	yeah
A	so it's a bit of a faff
B	okay
A	yeah
B	so if I drive in
A	yeah
B	I think this is my theory in Northern Ireland as well that you know when things freeze and stuff? if you've got like a well-maintained road that's really flat then you've got problems in snow and ice but bumpy roads grip
A	bumpy roads are brilliant
B	yeah you've got loads of grip and I reckon as well Northern Ireland didn't bother with speed bumps really they just didn't bother repairing their roads it worked fine
A	in snow with the valency tyres
B	yeah so let's see if
A	no because she sent a text unless she would have woke up sent a text and then erm went back to sleep let me just take off many clothes
B	yeah me too say bye
A	bye
B	bye
