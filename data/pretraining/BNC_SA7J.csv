A	oh pardon me

unknown_female	no

I	there we go
A	that's better
I	now you'll find the arrow won't go round
F	at least at least the dog won't get his nose on it too often now
A	right basic basic rules you keep going round the outside rim and every time you get round once you move your inside thingy one place and you just decide how many places you want to play until the game's over so if you want a short game you might say just go to there if you wanted a mega long game you'd go right to the end
B	mm
J	okay
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	see that would annoy me I would have to start half way along and finish at the end
A	right we can start half way along

G	no
B	oh right so you can
G	well mm sort of but no not really

F	oh right

A	goes round and round and round and round and you get one move for every one that you say correctly
J	okay
A	right?

unknown_female	we put the timer down on its side and we challenge you
J	right
A	and it says in the rules something to the effect of
unknown_female	the teams decide quickly between themselves whether the challenge is upheld
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	if the challenge is upheld and you were wrong that's the end of your game if it's not upheld if you were right

A	then the timer goes back up
unknown_female	and you keep going as if nothing happened

unknown_female	they're called the coin of decision
B	do you not get a huge box for what's in it?

D	I dunno how long it'll be
D	I also need to pick up some alcohol
C	is that the time she
D	sorry?
C	is she actually likely to get in at ten past six?
D	that's what time the train's due
C	right mm but is that er is that like by the timetable or by the current data?
D	by by the time well by the current data as she's looking at it on her phone
unknown_female	they're usually pretty good if they're running from
D	yeah it's never usually delayed between
B	yeah
I	from
E	yeah but there's there's never there's hardly ever big delays though is there?
D	yeah there's never usually er a constant actual thing er between
I	yeah yeah yeah
unknown_female	yeah
D	like going straight through
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	there are connections that they're waiting aren't they for?
D	but a lot of them terminate at
B	yeah
D	they go up through
B	well she came up from
I	yeah ten minutes
D	yeah
A	who's that?
A	oh okay
B	but er if we tell
A	I've told him
B	oh you've told him
A	yes I did but if you want if it was if it if you're gonna get here about ten past then he could probably delay it a bit if you're picking her up at ten past and then going to hers and then coming back it's
D	not going to hers I'm going to
unknown_female	it's still too
D	yeah so just tell him to do what he's gonna do normally then we'll just come and get some
unknown_female	come on
D	oh yeah now you're moving
C	he moved his ears and his eyes and he couldn't decide if it was worth moving his head
unknown_female	yeah
B	oh yeah well he can shift when he wants to
unknown_female	it's more the banging
E	is it obvious? the alcohol free?
C	yes
E	is it?
D	it's fairly obvious on two of the four sides it says in big blue letters alcohol free and on all the sides it has a blue border around it
B	you've got your receipt I'm sure they'd change it cos it's not even come out the box or anything is it?
A	mm
C	it's a special drink responsibly version erm yeah I'm sure we'll sort it
A	erm
C	although you'd need the card as well wouldn't you?
A	well I can do an exchange
C	oh okay would the alcohol ones be the same price? oh you can always top up can't you?
A	mm
C	so if I give you the
A	is that okay?
C	mm
C	if you chuck the receipt back at me just so I can put it in the printer when I get home be good
A	right
C	here you are
A	what?
A	yeah yeah it's
K	so apparently you like an argument now
E	I don't know why mum keeps saying that I don't I don't particularly like an argument no
E	I er I have discussions with people about things that interest me but I don't have arguments
D	really?
A	it's just if you say something nice and controversial she'll join in put it that way
unknown_female	it were
E	if I if it's if I'm interested in it or if I feel particularly strongly about it then yeah
unknown_female	that's why it sounds like it's just the same as
E	but I guess anyone would do that wouldn't they?
A	which is now a red rag to
K	well you've got to admit
B	well
unknown_female	no
K	if women weren't working unemployment wouldn't be an issue cos there'd be twice as many
B	don't like the smell of it
A	is this you starting neutrally is it?
E	well say that again sorry?
K	if women weren't working there would be half as many workers for the same number of jobs
unknown_female	unemployment wouldn't be an issue
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	eh?
unknown_female	nor would child care
E	is this a joke?
unknown_female	no
E	oh you're being serious? oh
K	I am being serious that they are the facts
E	yeah probably
K	I'm not necessarily saying that it's what we should do as a society
unknown_female	anyone want a drink?
unknown_female	erm I wouldn't mind a glass of water
unknown_female	yeah I'll have a glass of water
K	cos I think it's to to judge people by their gender is wrong but I do part of me thinks that
E	mm in sheer numbers just numbers then yeah but you could say that
D	does anyone else want a glass of water while I'm on my feet?
I	want to get rid of that cup
B	er yes you could do
E	what makes it what makes you say that it should be the women that don't work?
K	exactly yeah but er I do think
E	let's halve the amount of men that work
K	yeah but if you're erm in a couple
A	and if no women were working there are certain careers that would be very short staffed
E	yeah
K	as there are already
E	yeah
A	but you'd compound the problem
K	yes it would
unknown_female	you get immigrants in for that
A	straight in for the kill
E	what what did he say?
A	you just get immigrants in for that
A	we were starting gently and building up to it mate you just just don't you worry about it
K	but they'd have to be
A	oh my god
E	so are female immigrants banned then?
K	straight male immigrants we don't want those gay boys working
E	oh yeah yeah this is a joke isn't it?
E	this is a joke
A	please tell me that you are joking
unknown_female	do you really think that
E	you are joking yeah okay
A	yeah
B	but it's skimmed

unknown_female	not powder and I didn't know if you could
J	don't drink coffee so
B	no? would you like a box?
E	what is it?

B	Nescafé
A	it's alcohol free
B	Nescafé
A	Nescafé there you go it really
unknown_female	Nescafé
B	it's alright it doesn't matter
E	what?
E	what is?
D	yeah I find them boring
E	yeah I know that
unknown_female	but there's been hype over that for like a year
B	they were bought by a mistake I don't mind them being decaf but anyway but erm
E	have you seen the trailer for it?
K	if you're not gonna use them I'll take them and I'll end up using them but I'm not particularly a fan of
B	no you don't you're not it's fine cos I can use them but I was thinking about
K	have a treaty to take the caffeine out
B	yeah
K	here's a controversial one then
E	oh no no I don't wanna see this is your fault
A	you're welcome
K	should same sex couples be allowed to adopt?
E	well why not?
A	because then you haven't got a role model
unknown_female	because
B	er well I stood up to get those and then I thought well I might as well
E	you don't need a role model
K	where's your evidence to support that?
E	in my opinion you don't need it
K	right yeah but if I said to you okay I'm gonna take a child and give it to some gibbons to see if the gibbons can raise it I'm not being
unknown_female	oh sorry
D	alright
A	I was just gonna say
K	but erm I E let's do an experiment with this child's development
E	yeah?
K	people would be up in arms about it quite rightly
E	mm?
K	it is an
A	what? so what's your argument
E	well there are there are single sex couples who have adopted
D	was this was this
unknown_female	mm maybe not no
A	er not single sex single parents
E	well there'd be a few years because there are erm some celebrities have in a same sex marriage and they've adopted and there's been pictures of them so
unknown_female	yeah yeah
K	oh yeah
unknown_female	he was like
E	yeah
K	before we've actually seen what happens it might well be that the kids come out absolutely wonderfully
unknown_female	I know that
unknown_female	okay
unknown_female	you know cos I know they'd be just as good parents
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	but whether they could provide both role models
A	but like I said what about single parents?
K	well yeah that's a similar thing but that's that's
A	cos then they've only got one adult contributing to their whereas if you've got two separate personalities
E	well I think that's I think that's where we disagree because I don't agree with there being with kids being
unknown_female	erm brought up with erm like stereotypical gender roles
unknown_female	I don't think there's erm I saw a video where some I don't know how accurate it is but some people in Sweden are erm raising their children where they're not
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	saying the boy should have
unknown_female	toy cars and the girls shouldn't have Barbie dolls and I don't think that the gender roles should matter I think as long as the parents erm raise them fairly and
B	right yeah
E	then I feel I don't think that it should be a problem
unknown_female	if you look
unknown_female	I mean I don't we don't know do we? so it could I could be wrong but personally I don't think it should matter as long as the kids are brought up fairly
A	if you look you were
D	and things to burn and kill and
unknown_female	yeah yeah and set fire to
E	no it's not you but it's a collective
unknown_female	mm
A	what I'm trying to say is that I I think gender dictates itself in a way
D	I'm getting a train
E	I I don't agree
E	I think it's mainly
C	any surface you'd push a car along
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	push a train along
unknown_female	you didn't think about buying a boys thing for me because you've been
A	those toys were already in the house the first toys you'd experienced were his toys
E	yeah but right fair enough
E	but afterwards you wouldn't have
unknown_female	I'm not gonna give her a male toy I'm gonna
A	no
A	no
unknown_female	my sister she didn't want to push any male stereotypes on
E	yeah
K	so she deliberately kept kept the house neutral
K	and he immediately gravitated towards boys toys
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	now I can't say it's
unknown_female	hello
unknown_female	how are you?
unknown_female	I'm okay
unknown_female	yeah?
unknown_female	what he sees on telly he sees boys playing with boys toys girls playing with girls toys
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	so you can't totally say that it's inner
A	weather wasn't too bad was it?
unknown_female	yeah
I	bit greasy up on the top of the
A	oh I bet it was yeah
K	but with a parent who was deliberately trying to avoid the bias she he
E	okay but that that could've been a coincidence
E	but that's I think I think
unknown_female	yes
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I'm sure that they they've done they've experimented on things like this and they've shown that hello hello
M	hello
unknown_female	hello
unknown_female	right
K	Merry Christmas
A	are you going through?
E	oh no I'm fine now
unknown_female	yeah

A	well the wedding wasn't a couple of doors down the person who lives a couple of doors down was getting married

M	the way that they chose the time of year was they thought at Christmas people usually like they've already travelled like they don't it's they've already got the time off
A	yeah
M	to to travel and go somewhere they've already probably got new outfits so they don't have to like spend more money on new outfits
unknown_female	oh yeah
unknown_female	they sort of tried to do it in the most cost-efficient way especially as the bride's son's getting married in May
unknown_female	so
unknown_female	ah
K	and he's got no excuse now to forget the wedding anniversary it'll be
unknown_female	mm
M	who?

K	cos er I I had er
M	that's the thing
unknown_female	yeah
K	I don't and if if you we always say there's three things that you've got the scope the quality and the time

unknown_female	I can't do a qualitative analysis on both of the
J	not in a day yeah no
unknown_female	mm

K	so it needs to be good enough for an intermediate meeting
M	so that's what I'm gonna say to them I'm gonna say is there any chance if I is that meeting definitely going to be on the twenty-first? or is there a chance that it's gonna be later like you said originally? and if it is gonna be on the twenty-first I know the material really well and I'd be more than happy to spend my day
unknown_female	mm
