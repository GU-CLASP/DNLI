A	there you go
B	so what is your second book about then?
A	yeah
B	yes
A	it has a very unexciting title because it's erm
B	oh right
A	so
A	going away from from them just being prepositions
B	yeah
A	or whether it's in literature
B	okay right how was the first book
A	well so far I've made something eighty-five pounds in total but
B	eighty-five pounds? oh that's
A	but that's that's what you expect you you you're glad that it's out there
B	have you have you taken anything for?
A	but it's it it means it means
B	two hundred thirty?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
B	which publisher was it responsible for it was it?
A	it's Palgrave Macmillan
B	yeah
A	it's
B	okay
A	and we've got we've got just a
B	yeah yeah
A	so but yeah that's that's that's just the kind of
B	mm
A	so
B	I think well it hopefully it will it will be the
B	I think it's gonna be difficult to know
A	easily
A	there's there's
B	oh really?
A	so yeah it's it's
B	yeah
A	it's perfect isn't it?
B	it is yeah
B	but but what
A	well they're
B	yeah
A	that does the classics
B	yeah
A	the ones who read classics at university tend to be
B	oh right what about universities they do they do they?
A	yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	interesting really
A	I know somebody who did archaeology and he he went
B	mm yeah Coptic yeah
A	so
B	mm
A	talking about Coptic
B	mm
A	Iran
B	yeah
A	mm
B	we have erm
A	mm
B	have a
A	mm
B	doesn't exist neither in Farsi or
A	yeah
B	in er Arabic you know for example
A	mm
B	zhe
A	mm
B	I mean in Kurdish we don't have zhe we have zhe but er
A	mm
B	Arabic doesn't have zhe
A	mm
B	but er we don't have er the sound of
A	mm
B	but in Arabic there is the sound of er of the pronunciation of the
A	mm
B	again
A	mm
B	the er doesn't exist
A	mm
B	in Farsi
A	so is it but is it just single sounds that are different?
B	single sounds yeah
A	cos
B	yeah
A	uses
B	yeah
A	for the thur
B	yeah
A	don't know how it's pronounced
B	yeah yeah just again er in Kurdish we don't have the sound of vur
A	er mm
B	but in Arabic is vur
A	yeah
B	it's used everything everywhere and in
A	yeah
B	again they don't have the sound of vur
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	Farsi than
A	mm
B	entirely different but
A	yeah
B	it's easier for Kurdish people to
A	right
B	the grammar or Arabic grammar is
A	very different
B	difficult and
A	mm
B	er complicated
B	yeah
A	and it was
B	mm
A	guarantees
B	yeah
A	he said so that's in the Constitution however if you then go by the
B	yeah
A	they cannot explain
B	oh right
A	because what they
B	yeah
A	which makes it more difficult for them
B	yes
A	and he said it they're looking at you know they did that was his paper
B	mm
A	erm
B	why who was they?
A	he's he's very very
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think last week
A	mm
B	they decided that
A	mm
B	they proposed to the parliament that
A	mm
B	one of the top universities
A	mm
B	should have a Kurdish department
A	mm
B	however that's gonna be difficult because
A	mm
B	who well the education system's in Farsi
A	mm
B	you can't
A	yeah
B	you're not allowed to er
A	mm
B	like
A	yeah
B	so er that is gonna be a problem
A	mm
B	college
A	yeah
B	at the moment
A	mm
B	well I told you
A	mm
B	it's difficult for us even to
A	mm
B	because they have been educated in Farsi
A	mm
B	and then they they went to university and
A	mm
B	finished university
A	mm
B	Farsi
A	mm
B	he's gonna struggle
A	yeah
B	so I someone like me from
A	mm
B	I will find it difficult to
A	mm
B	translate for someone who's from
A	yeah
B	for those Farsi words
A	because Kurdish really
B	exactly it would be the second language
A	yeah
B	so the majority of the time ninety-five percent
A	mm
B	er we will cancel that interview and then we have to bring someone
A	mm
B	who was the Farsi speaker? er a Kurdish and Farsi speaker
A	ideally? yeah
B	ideally yeah
B	the home office deemed that if you ask for someone
A	mm
B	that's discrimination
A	mm
B	or from Iraq you can't ask for this so they have to be the language
A	yeah
B	and he said then well I need er someone who speaks erm
A	mm
B	Farsi and Kurdish
A	mm
A	yeah because
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	one or two interpreters
A	mm
A	mm
B	it as you know the interpreter of the translations
A	mm
B	based on er guessing you know sort of thing and especially if that's their future you know you
A	yeah
B	and then you can't
A	mm
B	er we just stop the interview we don't we don't carry on you know they they always understand that
A	yeah well because it is it is legal isn't it? it's not just
B	yeah you're right yeah
A	mm
B	if the application's refused
A	mm mm
B	er the yeah they'll
A	they will have
B	er er that was that
A	mm
B	but we've seen cases in the past now they've
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	well it makes sense
B	yeah
A	er
B	I mean er er the problem is with er
A	mm
B	there's not only Kurdish Irani
A	mm
B	we have Hourani as well
A	mm
B	how do you speak do they speak Kurdish you know what I mean? and then
B	half of
B	so it will be really difficult you know so they have to
B	one or two of them
A	oh god
B	yeah so
B	er er it is not easy
A	that looks like my neighbours are back from their holidays
B	yeah
A	but he
B	yeah
A	going to
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yay it's them
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah early in the morning
B	early in the morning
A	er
B	yeah
A	erm and he had it up in the ramp and we went underneath and he said yeah yeah look at this look this is like
B	yeah
A	with front wheel drive you have a
B	yeah
A	you know like a coat thing
B	yeah
A	bearing inside
B	yeah
A	over time just happens
B	yeah
A	so that one needs to be done
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	get it warmer quicker
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	just
B	do you need the er car there er
A	yeah because otherwise you you you are getting bored stiff
B	yeah
A	well you can cycle I mean my my mate's there cycling everywhere but
B	but you don't need it for your work based in the university yeah?
A	no
A	obviously if it's snowing you don't cycle it's like but
A	it's it's safe why isn't it if you can crash with a car?
B	yeah it is yeah yeah yeah
A	well yeah it's a mountain bike
B	yeah
A	it is
B	ice yeah
A	er but that's
B	yeah
A	the year after next
B	the year after next
A	erm
A	apart from the fact that packing is always a disaster anyway
A	but
A	plus plus there's there's always people that I somehow
B	mm
B	yeah I
A	mm
B	you know people are like
A	mm
B	come there's nothing is going on? it's it's it's it's
A	mm
B	er the events you know and
A	that's what I have
B	yeah
A	cos all the theatres closed
B	yeah
A	and all the students had gone
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	you know you you would have to well you know you you you probably would have live music in
B	yeah
A	the
B	yeah
A	to the anti-white men march
B	yeah no you're right yeah I've seen
A	you see you see the videos?
B	I've seen the
B	by the
A	go on
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er
A	I saw them because when I
B	yeah
A	erm
A	and
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that might cause a problem
B	so
A	you didn't get the erm
B	they didn't get no they didn't
A	mm
B	er he travelled from
A	yeah
B	bus or
A	yeah
B	just er
A	yeah
B	in the place tried to give him some advice you know and he
A	yeah
B	he told them that he
A	yeah
B	just er
A	come back?
B	he came back and er
A	mm mm
B	tried to reassure them because he was
A	yeah
B	when he was trying to tell there are some idiots he was saying what what idiots like?
A	yeah
B	so that that that's good he didn't
A	well apparently yes because of part of the
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no they didn't
A	and there were not that many
A	mm
B	towards
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	er
B	for so many of those idiots to come from all over the world you know?
A	yeah
B	and yesterday was
A	every white man
A	yeah yeah because it was V
B	yeah I mean
A	which is like of all the times how badly chosen is that is that just because it's like
B	it's like yeah
A	yeah okay I hate the Japanese and it's like well
B	er er I think that
B	no
A	and that again they were like I think they could muster just about a hundred and it was
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well Nick Griffin is
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	which
B	yeah
A	far more
B	yeah
A	and
B	there are some places like this yeah
A	down south
B	mm mm
A	whereas the Africans here
B	yeah
A	they never even did the detour
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and I remember I was
B	the
A	Somalis
B	the Somalis
A	the Somalis it's now the Sudanese
B	mm
A	the Somalis they were very very upset about the new Somalis coming here
B	yeah
A	cos they'd settled
B	they'd settled yeah right yeah
A	and that happens time and again isn't it? it's the old er
B	mm
A	generation of of
B	no
A	sort of start
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they spend years here
A	yeah
B	different ideas different ideologies
A	mm
B	and that might cause a problem you know so for
A	mm
B	the original community
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah and yeah even now with ISIS British-born
B	yeah
A	and yeah and there is a few nutters
B	of course
A	they
B	mm
A	they all need to be taught a lesson it's like yeah
B	mm
A	millions of them it's
B	yeah I mean I I think it's ridiculous but I think
A	right
B	they
A	mm
B	there are more
A	yeah no I've got a friend
B	yeah
A	and from Benghazi and seeing what's going on now and er he er it's it's
B	yeah
A	he he just
B	mm
A	and he said it's true
B	mm
A	they're not saying enough you know they're they're just wishy-washy
B	yeah
A	or sort of very half-hearted and he said no you you have to really go for it
B	mm
A	these are murderers
B	yeah
A	this is this is this is taking
B	yeah
A	that is just not there
A	et cetera et cetera I wouldn't know enough
B	yeah
B	you know I think I I think the the interpretation is just there for anyone to
A	mm
B	take it really you know and er
A	mm
B	er they was violence but however
A	mm
B	it's not
A	you have to say well look at the Christian crusaders
B	oh yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	always
B	yeah yeah you're right yeah
A	mm
B	I dunno the
A	mm
B	er in general it was
A	mm
B	they don't take it that serious
B	they just pray and then that's it you know?
A	yeah
B	and the young generation they just can't be bothered with it you know it's it's er but there are some idiots you know so
A	mm
B	but er for other places it's different
A	mm
B	when you look at
A	mm
B	even
A	mm mm
B	they don't do anything about it you know? but they are
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
A	Saudi Wahhabi
B	yeah
A	and a Wahhabi is extremely intolerant and and
B	yeah
A	and mosques everywhere because
B	yeah
A	so
A	erm
B	er they the Wahhabis is being old men granddad that isn't involved with
A	mm
B	and er you just
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah exactly yeah
B	wow
A	it's
B	er I
A	shocking
B	yeah I think Middle East is
A	mm mm
B	I don't think I will ever see Middle East peaceful you know?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	but I don't know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	didn't want to
B	yeah
A	and you think like well if it comes to
B	yeah
A	that in Iran wasn't it?
B	I I think somewhere in Iran
A	yeah?
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and disease
B	mm
A	then you think like well if all these
B	yeah
A	conflicts you you have something far more important to deal with first
B	yeah I think
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
B	hot weather like this in her life
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	desertification? don't even know

A	it has never been as hot as last
B	yeah
A	so between twenty-nine and thirty-two every day
B	mm
A	which they never had before
B	oh
A	so
B	yeah
A	and then very very cold winters
B	oh right
B	I think it's a bit cold I dunno I
A	no no
A	why did I go there?
A	I know why I went but yeah it's it's not the
A	the most appealing
B	yeah
B	well temporarily is alright you are you're you are there aren't you for a couple of years
A	mm
B	to live there all your life I think that would be
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	the sun is out
A	yeah
B	when the sun
A	yeah it's not just it's not just your vitamin D
B	yeah er
A	but

A	you have to take vitamin D tablets and now with
B	mm
