A	about the Valentine's menu and said something like like put a like pointed a picture of the menu that
B	yeah
A	and said er either
A	still still can't believe this Valentine's menu main course options of curry or artichoke like
A	you know it's like right fuck you and and then and then the next
C	well it's not your problem if he's got problems
B	the only one he isn't really yeah
A	no but
A	and and the and the and then the next the next tweet was and it was thirty-five quid exclamation exclamation and I was like and I was like this guy is such a cunt because we'd just worked really hard and I'd made the most fucking
B	oh
A	unbelievably beautiful and delicate and aromatic and amazing biryani that I'd ever made
B	it was alright
A	it was so fucking delicious
C	you
C	so carry on what happened?
A	and so so I was like
B	including wine three courses
A	it included a glass of sparkling wine it included three courses and a la carte it would've been more expensive
C	that doesn't sound expensive to me at all
A	no and I'm just like well fuck off and so
A	so I was like if you want if you want I can send you a breakdown of the costing erm is er er
A	if is this and then the next one I was like is this really how you categorize all Indian food? cos I was really angry that he was just like dismissed it as curry cos it's like
C	yeah
A	this is a fucking this is like biryani is like a is meant to be like a celebration meal and it had like fucking rose petals and
C	what happened? he didn't get laid and he blamed it on the food?
B	yeah yeah
C	cos he got too farty?
A	basically and then but then it was like
A	but then er but but then it's like I like
A	but the artichokes that we cooked right are not the ones that fucking make you fart the ones that make you fart are Jerusalem artichokes
A	you absolute idiot
B	oh really? I didn't know
A	no not
A	no yeah you just fart normally but but normal artichokes are just er like simply an exquisitely beautiful and delicious
C	I wouldn't I wouldn't associate that with farting
A	no but it's not cos I even like I googled it as well and I and there's no link and
C	there's only one way to find out
A	yeah there's
B	yeah
A	there's no link on the whole of the internet between like normal artichokes and farting and I was like you fucking idiot you just got it totally wrong by the way they're not
C	so what what did he say?
A	he didn't reply but he didn't reply
B	oh what?
A	no he didn't reply
A	and then I was like if you have any complaints or further questions then just email me blah blah blah and then er and then it turns out that the only person who replied was somebody who has a parody Twitter account to this guy who basically just goes around bullying people on Twitter
C	mm mm
A	and this person so the guy who sent the
C	why don't these people
A	I don't know I don't know

A	no I know and
B	we don't care you don't care if people write stuff like that
A	just some but it was just it was just because I thought
C	it's cos you worked hard on it

C	mm

C	have a
E	cos that's what you were saying about when we went to all these places to eat in
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah

A	that's awesome
B	what's he saying to you though?
B	that's it?
C	that's it
A	he probably just really likes what you do he's probably just
C	mm yeah I know I mean I er that's not that's not my opinion

C	he's probably trying to
E	should do a screen grab of his comment and then post that on Instagram
B	yeah

B	you should write on your Twitter account

B	yeah
A	right I'll do that
E	it's that's actually the best Costcutter ever that one
B	it is actually
C	yeah that's er that's cos it's a franchise
A	they're a franchise
B	they're a franchise yeah I know
E	er I think you like just lease you like lease out the name

E	this is about stitching up your friends that's what it's about
A	she's just trying to play play yeah she's trying to play one small business against another

C	shit everyone was telling me about a lolz thing about a burger van
B	do you mean some okay I don't know anything within the last fifteen years
C	what about like Summer Heights High and stuff like that?
E	I think
B	yeah I've heard of that I mean I've watched that that's

C	that's pretty funny I thought Kath and Kim was funny too but that might've been of a time
B	Kath and Kim's
B	yeah that's the best we should fucking screen that
B	really good
E	I was making
A	I think I did too
E	it really got into my imagination
A	yeah

C	like Eerie Indiana?
B	well it's it's about it's kind of
B	like erm
C	I know the theme song I must've heard it
E	cos I don't really know I don't really know anything about it except like some sort of weird dream memories and stuff
B	yeah it's it's it's basically a show where like quite like where surreal things happen but like always no one else
E	yeah
C	oh
E	isn't there one thing where he gets isn't there one where he gets pregnant?
B	yeah like a dude gets pregnant
C	it's like Eerie Indiana
B	and it's a bit like Roald Dahl a little bit erm kind of but not really but like in that really sort of
C	mm
B	we could watch BMX Bandits Nicole Kidman's first movie
C	oh yeah yeah
B	erm that's like this that's fucking funny

B	let's go now
C	mm might close
E	it's so funny though just would you'd never guess to go in there or I wouldn't
B	yeah
B	I have been in there once and like the thing is whenever I've been past it I'm like shit gotta come back cos you're just going past it and like erm on my bike
C	it's well worth making a trip for
B	yeah
B	oh
C	he's got like heaps of plants
B	yeah
C	like all the way up the walls like this whole like
B	oh we should go back when should we go back?
E	that's how you clocked it though cos you saw him smoking right?
C	yeah well yeah I guess so
C	it still looked closed though I was like I guess he just like
C	hangs around like caretaking I mean
B	yeah let's go back
B	along the canal?
C	at
E	yeah to
C	at at
B	yeah
C	at
C	yeah
C	can you believe that?
B	oh no
C	and then you know when you get and then we walked through erm
C	the erm yeah
B	oh
C	and then we were like oh my god everyone's a dick and
B	yeah
C	we were talking about the
E	there was like there was like there was a crew er er there
B	yeah yeah they turn back into babies it's really weird
E	there was a crew that it looks like these like four people had like rented longboards
C	oh they had it was like
B	oh no
C	Boris boards
B	no
C	they were like just normal mums with like frumpy like coats and scarves
E	they weren't mums though they were all like twenty-five but they're like well like
B	oh no
C	I don't know it was hard to say but they
C	all got skateboards and they were like stopping and like
B	mm
C	it was weird it was weird er they were acting like they were on Boris bikes but they were on skateboards
C	you know so unfamiliar with their like vehicle
E	and there's was like rollerblading couples and stuff
C	they were they were funny cos they
E	the girl
C	and then like
B	ah
E	they've got helmets on
C	and then erm and then found this pub and it was like unchanged except they put a pool table back and erm
B	yeah sounds like it's the saviour of
C	sort of normal people working there and you know good vibes
C	lolz that they like shut the door though they're just secret they
E	yeah
C	why would you?
B	yeah why would you want all those people in? on a Sunday as well it's just like
C	mm
B	yeah
C	like the
B	yeah it's been so long though that it's been there like that that took a lot for it to
C	I don't know if I can stand to get attached to another pub though cos er I can't do another heartbreak like the
B	yeah
E	and the weird like Sex Pistols themed
E	inspired
B	yeah nothing better than
E	do you want a pie?
B	yeah
E	have you got pies?
C	pies
B	oh you don't oh yeah pies that's fine yeah
C	oh sweet pies
E	it's so funny cos it was packed
C	it was packed
E	and like for three months it had been empty
B	so where's a good place to go on a Sunday morning?
C	still only just
B	even that's been taken over but what? like
C	they might stick I don't know what's gonna happen to that pub but we went last Sunday obvs
B	yeah
C	and we were talking to the lady and she said they were probably gonna move to
B	yeah you yeah well you
E	but it depends what kind of thing they want
E	cos if they they're only gonna keep it open if they want like people who've been up all night coming in
E	and they probably wanna like serve pies
C	cos surely the
B	shall we take over it? how much do you think it would cost?
C	how much for the
B	yeah do you know how much?
C	fifty thousand a year
B	yeah but how much is there a premium?
C	mm dunno
C	I know that that guy considered it too expensive and he must've had a shitload of money
B	fifty grand's a is a lot to pay a year like fucking that's a shitload
A	on rent? that's loads
B	yeah we pay like fifteen a year
C	I was surprised he didn't take the
B	yeah
B	oh so he's not gonna take it? the guy
C	no
B	from the
C	no
B	yeah
C	no that's why the whole thing was called off cos he he said it got too expensive
B	oh cos it got too expensive?
E	er look look look at the coasters from that pub
B	yeah but like no one's ever in that pub like
E	look at the look at the coasters
B	it's definitely
E	that's what I used to drink as a child
B	yeah I had
C	what do you
E	I I
B	K's K is pretty good
E	there was a whole summer when I was like thirteen or fourteen when I just like didn't
A	which one's the
C	landlady
B	you know where it is
E	yeah when I was there
B	it's the one on the way to
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	mm
A	I was getting confused with the one on the
C	yeah that's the
C	yeah
B	fifty grand a year
C	pretty sure
B	yeah
C	for that
A	I guess if it's that much money then that size'd be tricky
C	mm
E	it's too small to do food though right?
C	it had an upstairs and I dunno what no
E	we folded it up
C	mm
B	you might miss our erm closing down party
C	when's that?
B	probably on the fourteenth
C	yeah we'll be away oh well you'll be partying from then on right?
A	that's right
C	plenty of time for that
B	exactly that's right that's er that's the reaction I expected
C	come to Paris
A	yeah
C	it's not a one time thing
B	oh can you just make it the week after?
B	I hope it's then we're gonna we're
A	wait are we gonna keep this flat then? what's the plan? keeping it? staying here?
B	don't wanna move
A	shall we try and get a longer contract?
B	let's get a roll on
B	roll ons are the best because they would never kick you out because they just want you to stay
A	yeah
B	but then if we decided we wanna move to Boston
B	then we could give them the month's notice
B	yeah
C	should go and check it out
A	yeah let's go and check it out let's go to the States come on everyone
B	right now you're pushing for it
A	yeah
B	you're usually the one that's not
C	I wanna erm buy a place in erm Greece this year too I really do
B	yeah that one looks good I think we should ask them for some photos of it obviously it's a renovation thing
C	I mean no it's not even a that one looked good I
B	yeah but I mean that's er
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	some money to buy a place?
C	but I kind of just wanna buy somewhere outright you know?
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	I don't really understand how to do anything else with money I don't I've never had a credit card or like borrowed money really
B	yeah yeah
C	small small amounts
B	cos if you wanna buy something in
C	from like the bank for like my thing
A	well I
B	well the benefit of buying something
A	that you would have to make
B	yeah
A	for a
B	and if if you bought
C	well I I mean I don't reckon I don't reckon like I I hope that within that price range could buy something that wouldn't be like a massive commitment of work
A	yeah
B	oh no oversea like in Greece?
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	that would be fine like you'd be fine especially if you left yourself a bit extra like you wouldn't wanna spend it all because then you'd need to fix it which you should probably be able to do for like it depends how shit it is but like
C	mm
B	ten grand twenty grand or something like
C	yeah
B	cos that one will be completely shit like you have to redo the whole thing
C	mm
C	I didn't even really look at it I was just looking at the price and like
B	but there's no pictures of the place they just said renovation project which means it'll be run down and it's just fucked
B	yeah
C	but I mean erm I looked through even just like the very very like first page of what's available in erm in Greece and everything is insanely cheap and then like just to compare like looked at several other countries and like
B	yeah
B	oh yeah it's
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly
C	I don't know if I could anyway I haven't got that much and like I don't think I'm very like
B	no I mean you
C	mortgageable cos
B	yeah you need to have shit on paper
A	yeah yeah
C	it's like
B	yeah yeah
C	I don't think er it would be like a tricky thing I think
A	yeah I think I think you might be right
B	it'd be a nightmare as well
A	in terms of mortgage and shit
C	it'd be more fun it'd be somewhere I'd wanna go for the rest of my life I don't I don't I don't think there's anything like I don't imagine
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	but then if I had like somewhere which is like er me and my friends and family would like to go to for the rest of our lives it's like remains like a you know? a nice home somewhere when you can get to it it's like makes a lot more sense to me
B	yeah me too
C	plus something I can actually afford I dunno
B	yeah
C	I don't really understand like mortgages
C	borrowing money being in debt
B	yeah
C	I've never really done it
A	yeah and er
C	although it's totally normal
A	and a mortgage is like a it's a massive commitment that you it's not like you can't just like you can't decide to stop paying the mortgage repayments
B	yeah
E	unless you sell the house
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but it's like but if you if you can't afford to pay it then
B	no
C	most people do it all the time I'm sure it's doable but
B	probably
A	in terms of like no it's it it'd be cheaper than paying rent that's why everybody wants to buy
B	yeah
A	it's just that you have to have all these credentials to get a mortgage and it ties you in er for the
A	yeah yeah it's
C	if that
A	it's like if like when are you actually gonna have have er like you know half a million pounds? I mean it's
C	next year
A	you just pay the interest off or whatever
C	mm
A	I dunno but it's like it's a real tying in thing there's no opting out
C	mm
A	no it sounds like
B	yeah there's way more fun to be had
C	it's true though
B	buy a boat as well if you buy the house I'll try and buy a boat
C	then we can row there
E	did you did you see the thing about
C	oh yeah I dunno oh you know my friend
B	oh yeah yeah you have yeah
A	yeah
C	old like rockabilly anyway I went to see him recently and like he's like yeah when I started living on a boat I was the only one on a boat but everyone's got a boat now it's like everybody the boatmen it's like I'm gonna get a flat and be
A	that's awesome
C	everybody the boatman
A	yeah a place in Greece would be really cool
C	I think so
A	like I think like most people don't want to take risks in other countries as much because
E	like Greece
B	yeah like Greece
C	why?
A	well because cos
B	Greece is like the the damned economy
C	but it's not about an investment
E	yeah exactly
B	no of course I know that that's why people won't wanna do it
C	but how would you lose it if you still own a house?
B	no you don't you don't but you'd lose like if you just wanted to buy a house and it was yours and your family's you wouldn't
C	yeah that's what I want
B	erm if you were renting it out you'd lose it you know?
C	mm
B	no but people see it as in like
B	er you could take your forty grand like get a mortgage buy a house in
C	mm
B	earn X amount over the next year cos the property in
E	yeah
B	sell it and you've made that money so you're making money on
A	but yeah
C	yeah
E	there's that thing in the I saw erm on
A	fucking hell
E	in like wherever and then you
B	christ in
E	or like in if you're in uni in like
B	yeah
E	you can buy a house in
B	yeah
E	and then that's what you pay the mortgage with
B	yeah
E	then once you've been there for three years cos the property's like you've already made twenty grand
B	yeah
E	you sell it and then you've got twenty grand
A	woah
B	yeah no matter what in in
A	but you don't necessarily that's just our perception right now because we're thinking of it
B	yeah
A	but the housing market hasn't always been like that it's been up and down
B	yeah but it's always gonna be
E	it's up it's up but
A	like we've only seen it go up but it's not always up
E	the reason why it's
B	it's mainly always up
A	it's not
E	it's not really gonna go down I think in especially in
A	yeah but that's only been recently
B	yeah
A	like that's not that's not
A	like that it hasn't always been like that in
C	no that's true
A	you know like er I think
C	but it's a safer bet like at least for the
B	mm
C	short term
A	yeah it is a safer bet for the short term
C	but also it's not it's not as simple as that it's not like
B	no you'd have to try hard to get a mortgage and
C	and then er you know
A	but also I think like things can change
A	yeah no what I mean is that costs like there are so many variable costs which can change which is why people I think won't necessarily do that
A	yeah I mean that's why people invest in a country where they live so they understand what's going on rather than investing in another country because there are more like unknowable risks you don't you don't always know what's what's happening it's like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	oh I see rather than
A	yeah
A	no I'm not saying you should worry I'm just saying these are the reasons why probably people don't do it as often
B	really?
A	yeah it'd be great
B	yeah exactly that's the thing
C	get some goats or something you know?
C	making millions on goat's cheese
A	couple of chickens
C	sell it in Costcutter
A	wait are you gonna get a donkey?
C	yeah
C	who who's gonna train the goats?
C	I was just saying that I really liked milk by the way
C	not that it's actually my dream to
C	he was like man you love it I was like yeah man I'd drink it straight out of the cow if they let me
C	not that I actually want to do that
C	in any kind of like fetish
E	it sounds fucking weird man
E	no
B	no you don't
C	no? don't you have to treat it?
B	no that's er that er no that's just the idea of like unpasteurised milk in like England
B	Jamaica or whatever
B	yeah
