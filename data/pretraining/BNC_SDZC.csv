A	that was

B	mm hm
A	when you're not sat in an office like you normally are all day every day
B	yeah
A	that's when
B	bit of inspiration
A	yeah good things come don't they?

A	yeah be nice
B	I'll probably be quite hung over on the Sunday morning so
A	oh crikey yeah
A	it'll be nice
B	I'm not that bothered about drinking though but
A	but is everybody going
B	peer pressure
A	other than
B	everyone
B	there's me
A	ah that'll be really good won't it?
A	and you're not going to anyone's house are you?
B	erm I think
B	mm hm
A	his mum and dad?
B	yes
A	which pub?
B	I'm not sure
B	in
A	not the one
B	erm
A	and the one that we went to as well?
B	that was
A	yeah
B	for
A	that's
B	mm
A	I dunno where the
B	it's it's pretty close it's down those lanes
A	right
B	yeah
A	why have you picked that one?
B	just
A	oh will dad be there?
B	mm
A	yeah I remember you saying
B	comes out with some funny stuff
A	yeah
B	it's funny cos in our in our group it's
A	yeah
B	did you know that?
A	yeah
B	so he's he's probably he must be dreading it cos he's gonna get absolutely rinsed
A	tomorrow?
B	mm even by
A	yeah?
B	mm
A	oh
B	mm
A	I remember him saying something to you once about me
B	mm hm
B	punching aren't you?
B	done alright there haven't you son?
A	it'll be cool
B	get one then
A	wouldn't be allowed to
A	mm
B	in this erm over the
A	yeah
B	and they're quite
A	yeah
B	so I dunno if that's that's my idea of getting a bike that's the sort of thing I wanna be doing
B	but I think
A	you I've only had two same as you
B	do you want some filling?
A	no
A	so what
B	he just keeps saying oh don't wanna go down there I don't wanna fall off
A	well same with you
A	oh god
B	bit of a lunatic I am aren't I?
A	here we go again
B	adrenalin junkie
A	you just need to be careful
B	bit dry these aren't they?
A	yeah cheese would be good
B	and salad
A	is
B	erm
A	huh?
B	I think so yeah I think
A	yeah
B	cos when there's a lot of us it can get quite crowded
A	yeah
B	you don't talk all at you talk in groups don't you? you end up talking to the one or two people close to or
A	yeah
B	any more than that and you start
B	dispersing off into different groups
A	yeah
B	and
A	cos he probably what?
B	he's not a big drinker so he doesn't drink pints at all so
A	no
B	I think he feels a bit intimidated on er
A	hasn't why why would but if you were if they were your proper friends then surely you wouldn't feel intimidated? like you don't drink but you just kind of drink loads because they're drinking loads that's not who you are that's why
B	intimidated is the wrong word then it's just peer pressure I guess it's it's
A	yeah
B	just being with the lads it's like a big occasion
A	yeah but I guess again
B	it's like if imagine it was one of your friend's birthday like are you coming out are you drinking? and you're like no they'd be like oh that's a bit boring isn't it?
A	mm
B	cos it's hyped up to be such a big occasion it's like come on have a pint but
A	yeah
B	which is
A	like you and
B	but we'll come in and
A	mm it's a weird
B	imagine if I said what you don't do drugs?
A	no
B	yeah I'm just saying if you don't like a drink
A	drink is just seen as more sociable isn't it?
B	but it's not good it's bad for you
A	no
B	and it's
A	yeah no I totally agree that's what I'm saying to you
B	mm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but you don't get wrecked that's not who you are
B	I do sometimes
A	mm
B	yeah very rarely if it's like a big occasion I'll I'll drink I don't drink to get drunk
A	huh?
A	you be careful
B	also I think uni like yours
B	binge drink
A	the pub?
B	so what's your plan on Sunday?
A	yeah I was meant to call
B	what you cooking?
A	beef I think
B	beef dinner
A	mm
B	roast dinner?
A	mm
B	ooh
A	dauphinoise potatoes
B	what potatoes?
A	dauphinoise
B	nice
B	what for? to ingredients?
A	yeah for Sunday
B	is that really necessary
A	no I'm
B	well for leisure
A	oh
B	so it's like a it's a set meal plan so you'll say oh yeah
A	that's cool
B	but you know if you look at a recipe online you'd be like you need crème fraîche?
A	no
B	and the same for a bit of coriander or
A	oh
B	so this gives you the right potion for that meal
A	no waste
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm so she's thinking of doing that
A	why? have you
B	I mean she's like
A	spoke to her?
B	no no she just liked the look of the recipe more the recipes
A	mm
B	I'm not really sure if she is or isn't to be honest
A	mm
B	she
A	oh well let her
B	mm
A	it's alright
B	was it?
A	good isn't it?
B	mm
A	from seventy-five
B	very good
A	I think
B	shall I put twenty and then just get
A	she'll lose that
B	do you reckon?
A	yeah
B	she'll wear it for a few months
A	and then lose it
B	mm
A	which is annoying
B	yeah well
A	oh yeah
B	she's going out with erm
A	yeah
B	she rang me yesterday actually
A	what's one of them?
A	yeah for him
B	and then she's like
A	what?
B	and I was like right no
A	yeah
B	some sort and she's like
A	what?
B	I thought right
A	yeah
B	and then she had someone at the door at work so she had to
A	and what did she say?
B	she put
A	it seems a bit weird
B	yeah like I
A	he yeah but he I feel like he walks a little bit all over your mum like what's what's he going out for dinner with her for?
A	like
B	she she enjoys it so
A	yeah I know but er he he now knows that she doesn't wanna be just friends she's admitted that to all of us and that just doesn't go away
B	no
A	that doesn't go away
B	no
A	and he knows that he knows that you she told you that you told me that so we all know
B	yeah
A	and I think the way that he then still takes her out for dinner cos obviously your mum's gonna say no I don't wanna speak to you to start with but then
B	yeah
A	that's what it's all about and like you're a fool
B	I think she's she obviously enjoys having him there
A	yeah
B	than not at all
A	but again I think it's really bad
B	even if it's friends
A	on his behalf then
B	yeah but if they're both enjoying it doesn't mean so what?
A	no yeah I know but I think he just walks a little bit all over your mum I don't know I don't think it's very I don't think it's very right I think
B	but at least she knows what she's getting he's been honest hasn't he?
A	I doubt he was
B	I dunno it's
A	no I know
B	I don't know the ins and outs and
A	I know but I just think that's what that's my opinion on it
B	but my mum's not exactly
A	yeah I know but when she was
B	she did get quite upset about it yeah
A	I think I dunno I just think it's
B	obviously not
A	so
B	well maybe he does maybe he's just unsure god knows
A	mm that's all a bit dodgy to me
B	he's got two young children
A	yeah
B	it there's definitely a hidden agenda there
A	yeah
B	he doesn't know anything about me
A	what why?
B	obviously my mum probably bigs me up but
A	why?
B	but remember like a few months ago he
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	ideas from him
A	weird
B	and have some
A	weird
B	it's almost like he's looking for an idea to steal or
A	weird
B	it's definitely
A	yeah babe
B	will he send some parcels that's just an excuse to come along and look at my unit
B	and see what I'm up to isn't it?
A	mm hm
B	he's a businessman at the end of the day he wants to make money he's got
A	of course
B	kids to feed and
A	yeah
B	he doesn't care about me
A	no
B	will you send a few parcels for me?
A	bad isn't it?
B	it's just
B	but you can
B	friends and you can help each other but
B	why me?
A	this isn't
B	he doesn't know anything about me
A	this isn't friends
B	I'm not a million pound businessman am I?
A	you're not friends
B	I've never met him
A	you've never ever met the guy before so why on earth does he want you to send his parcels?
B	weird
A	exactly so
B	cos it's so easy to do
A	so he can come to your warehouse
B	see what see what I'm up to
A	and so he can see what you're doing
B	reckon
A	and I think it's really bad again that he's going through your mum
B	yeah
A	doesn't he know that?
B	yeah
A	so he knows that your mum's obviously gonna then ask you and try and
B	yeah
A	he knows that
B	I might just say to mum
A	and then didn't she she's bought him stuff in the past like
B	yeah she's had a printer for him and she's
A	stuff from school for him
B	apparently he helps her out just as much apparently
A	with what?
B	I dunno
A	being there as a friend? I dunno I don't like I don't know I don't
B	reckon he's just got a load of women that do a load of stuff for him?
A	I think
B	do you reckon he's got three of my mum?
A	I think
B	I don't know he got her a really nice Christmas present and he he takes her out he does
A	yeah
B	treat her well
A	yeah
B	he takes her to the cinema
A	but wouldn't he do that with the rest of them?
B	he sees them on on
A	he's a businessman hasn't he got money to buy them all a nice Christmas present?
B	I don't think yeah but
A	yeah no
B	he'd just come round and
A	I understand understand but again they're the
B	he's obviously
A	dodgy ones
B	no they're not
A	no
B	in terms of from a male speaking the dodgy ones are the ones that don't wanna take you out
A	yeah
B	just wanna get you
A	yeah
B	straight around the house
A	definitely
B	cos you know
A	yeah
B	what they want
A	yeah obviously but I think this is just seedy I think I dunno there's something not
B	I
A	right there
B	I think yeah
A	I just hope she doesn't
B	you you I I think he wants some sort of
B	it's a way in why
A	yeah
B	and you pay
A	mm
B	it's not a rocket science he knows how to send a frigging parcel
A	course he does of course he does
B	his company's turns over a few million I think
B	and he doesn't know how to send a parcel what an idiot
A	again
B	he might be able to help you out in the future
A	so that that's what he said to your mum then yeah?
B	no I dunno
A	yeah
B	who knows
A	course you would
B	if I found out your neighbour was doing something I'd do it
A	would you?
B	if I found out
A	I think that's just that's just being a human though surely everybody's got that instinct
B	yeah
B	but it's like
A	mm
B	he come to our unit
A	mm
B	a couple of months ago
A	yeah
B	they're pretty serious
A	mm
B	her
A	toilet rolls?
B	yeah imports loads and loads of toilet roll from China
A	mm
B	makes an absolute killing on it apparently like he's
B	he's got his Porsche he lives in Dubai
B	I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't have any loyalty to him
A	good riddance
B	yes
A	that's alright
B	wasn't too bad was it?
A	no
B	mm
A	do you get what I mean?
B	you think he's quite a complex character do you?
A	mm
B	erm
A	can you see why I think that?
B	do you almost see him as just like a boring typical man but then he's got this sort of
A	mm
B	there's like a big twin exhaust put on he's had an air filter on and it makes it louder and faster
A	but again to me that's like the opposite to
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm hm
A	I don't know
A	weird isn't it?
B	reckon he's he enjoys
A	yeah I reckon he enjoys it
B	I feel like I'm a very much take it or leave it so kind of guy as well though
A	mm
B	I think he just boxed out emotion and deals with things
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she said like wanting to
A	yeah
B	he started renting a house within like
A	mm
B	he literally just just did it he didn't
A	have you ever seen him cry?
B	er
A	yeah?
B	mm
A	and then he's got such a soft spot for your sister hasn't he?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	daughter I guess though isn't it?
A	mm hm
B	mm
A	yeah
A	was that mm for me?
B	yeah
A	I thought it was for you
B	no
A	you've got one for the morning now
B	yes I've got another one in there from before as well actually
A	have you?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	do you think
A	well they have so far haven't they?
B	they're doing well aren't they?
A	cos we had our little
B	did we?
A	mm
B	is that what I said as well? think they'll last?
A	that's what you said yeah
B	I think if
A	remember when he first started coming round
B	I don't no I don't remember
A	yeah I know but you didn't give him a chance
B	fair enough
A	he's decent for your sister
B	it's weird though cos
A	though isn't he let's face it
B	yeah yeah he treats her well
A	yeah
B	yeah she's horrible
A	mm
B	apparently his er
A	mm
A	who?
B	his sister yeah
A	yeah
B	had a chat with
A	yeah
B	so about
A	brilliant
A	it's what it's what he needed
B	oh I'm just saying er a big worry of hers is
B	yeah
A	hundred percent
B	because she's that cold and that's what she's
A	splitting the family up
B	put in that predicament that sort of ultimatum
A	definitely babe yeah
B	and it'll it'll split him up from
A	yeah
B	his family
B	decent girlfriend
B	she knows
A	what yeah
A	well what's
B	he's needy
A	what is he doing?
B	he's needy
A	yeah but what's he doing there?
B	I tell him honestly a a a thought
A	three hundred pound down
B	no
A	it was forty pound down yesterday and fifty pound down the day before
B	who is it and how have they got your number?
A	I left my number it's the management
B	is it?
A	mm
B	would you prefer it if they rang you?
A	no I said to her let me know if
B	oh okay
A	she's good
B	so what are your consequences gonna be? are you gonna pull everyone in?
A	I don't think somebody's taken it
B	why?
A	I don't know actually
B	do you think?
A	yeah she's not filled in the formula right
B	so again just double check it tomorrow
A	mm
B	oh great
A	lord help us all
B	yeah
A	anyway carry on
B	oh yeah I was just saying like when I was up on Wednesday I just randomly go
A	did
B	yeah and
A	he did it?
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	like the lads all in favour of
A	is that the day that like
A	yeah but
B	she's an easy option
A	come on
B	she gives him such a hard time
C	come on
B	yeah
A	he's gonna be twenty-five this year he needs to sort himself out
B	yeah
A	honestly
B	I think you should in the
B	no
A	what the hell's he doing then?
B	I think he's because he's been with her that long he knows
A	why are they messing around at this age?
B	he knows no different
A	normal
B	it's just part it maybe it's just
B	horrendous
B	put the phone down on him and putting pressure on him and
A	like I was saying to you
B	mm hm
A	just like you are so it's it's erm
B	she's just selfish
B	like
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	when did she sit down with him?
B	I think she said it a few weeks ago maybe I'm not sure
A	before they went on holiday?
B	I'm not sure when it was said but
A	what?
B	yeah
A	and you know when he was telling you that did he agree with what
B	yeah I think he knows it
A	that he's
B	he I dunno why he's there's something keeping him there obviously
A	what though?
B	god knows
A	cos they're both so unhappy
B	I think so I think she's unhappy as well really
A	but you you can see that you can see that
B	yeah
A	and even when we went to London
B	that was but I think that was their
A	yeah but
B	what's the point
A	yeah but again
B	of
A	yeah
B	no and not for months
A	and that was terrible the way that they were at that oh god I'll never forget that
B	they'll stay together until one of them finds out that the other one's cheating
A	well I dunno
B	think they'll be forced to
A	oh god it's all
B	she's so supportive
A	put on isn't it?
B	I think no she's not
A	for the time being
B	it's purely from a convenience
A	but then doesn't
B	he's not mm
A	does it annoy you?
B	er
A	cos that would annoy me if I'd had my say or and I said look like
B	he's an askhole in that he never takes
A	he's a what?
B	askhole
A	what's an askhole?
B	someone that asks for your opinion but never takes it anyway
A	oh I thought it was like saying bit of an asshole
B	yeah askhole it's a combination of the two
A	oh
A	is that what he's like?
B	that is
A	mm and what's the point then?
B	oh mate do you think I should finish with
A	no point wasting your time babe
B	you have no intention
A	mm
A	mm
B	good for you as well

A	on Instagram with her that one time
B	yeah
A	that she never drops and she hates them doesn't she? she hates them she hates
B	yeah
A	but that's only because she's had something with

B	yeah
C	had a bit of a disaster today
B	yes
A	yeah
C	next time you just walk back in and get the car to
A	yeah there's no point like I said I just kind of assumed I'd get on a coach but like you said after I spoke to you and you said it took hours
B	I can imagine
A	mm
B	that's horrendous isn't it?
A	all school kids
B	should be compensation
C	I would imagine that er
A	we cos I get on the train with all the school kids
C	yeah I imagine
B	mm
C	three hours later
B	well I suppose they have to
C	by which time the train's back on so
B	yeah
C	they haven't got a coach on
B	yeah oh yeah cos they have to stop off at every station
C	well pretty much I've done it before but it takes
B	mm
C	well for me it was unless you get a taxi and then in which case you
B	yeah
C	you used to be able to get compensation I wonder whether there's any
B	it's probably a really lengthy process isn't it?
C	probably have to be er
B	you're not
A	mm
B	remember when er
A	yeah yeah
B	as soon as you got off the train
C	yeah because they er
B	they anticipated it it's
C	yeah the they planned for that
A	mm
C	the coach whereas
B	it's all messed up
C	soon as they realised it the trains are not gonna
A	so how come they're not working? what what why what makes them not work?
C	well there's well I dunno
C	that's the usual one as soon as the train stops
A	signalling
C	and then they have to move that train to get there so they have to get another train out to move that train
A	they're talking a lot about
C	and then the service can resume
A	signalling
C	and the
A	yeah that's what had failed
C	signals yeah
B	it's better that they're safe
C	we've had er
A	yeah
C	or or even just trees on the track you know
C	big big erm or then another where erm you know er you know railway a a bridge and then over a road and then a a lorry goes into the bridge so
C	get a a risk
B	yeah
C	okay if that happens
A	hours
C	then well then you're then they wouldn't go over the bridge er obviously for safety reasons you know if the bridge collapsed with the the
B	yeah
C	weight of the train they'd have to er
B	do you know what I googled the other day? I googled how many suicides there were in the UK
C	did you?
B	er
C	what you were feeling a bit morbid where you?
A	why?
B	I was I was intrigued I dunno why
C	oh yes yeah I
B	there's was about
C	what did you wake up and think oh I wonder how many
A	yeah
B	I dunno I think that you
A	happy days
B	you must have been getting the train and that made me think of Japan
C	right
B	that's like one every day almost
A	oh my life
B	yeah
B	one a day
C	right yeah
B	cos in Japan they were efficient they knew exactly what they were doing didn't they?
A	oh yeah
C	right yeah yeah
B	they they'd cleaned it up within
B	a couple of hours and they had all
A	oh it was quicker than that
B	the public
B	yeah the public didn't say anything
A	tent
B	massive sheets and
C	to hide it yeah away away from people
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so high in the UK that's crazy isn't it that?
A	yeah it is weird
C	it is quite a lot
A	one a day
B	isn't it isn't it the biggest killer between the age of twenty to thirty though suicide?
C	I don't know
A	I wouldn't know that no
B	mm
C	yeah yeah I dunno
B	well that could have been the reason
B	the train was delayed
C	that's your next project
C	report back
B	uncooked quesadillas
C	yeah yeah food poisoning from
A	oh don't say that mum's already made a joke about food poisoning
C	oh that was it yeah
A	I said my day's
A	going bad to worse
A	she's like oh don't go next thing you know you'll have food poisoning from your dinner
C	mm
A	it's probably why I was so worried about the chicken
B	it'll be fine I'm quite a good cook
A	and then you've just spoke about food poisoning
C	mm
A	oh god
B	and then she got a parking ticket as well just to top it all off
C	mm oh you'll
A	haven't got a receipt
C	well it's on your phone isn't it?
B	it's on your phone isn't it?
A	yeah
C	that's what I mean
A	oh that's what I was saying
B	for traffic warden and
A	I'm so annoyed at them
B	cos surely it's done was that the only means of getting a ticket by texting?
A	no you could
C	might not be
A	you could put
B	so you know when you got the text saying thank you
A	I had
B	did it say you've gotta display anything?
C	it'll be
A	what's my number plate?
C	it's on the phone
B	oh that's why
A	M?
C	M mother
B	oh yeah it's your own stupid fault then isn't it?
A	shit
C	oh that's why they haven't matched it up then they do it
C	they'll do an electronic match won't they?
B	you've got N haven't you?
B	N for November
C	oh
A	but I was looking at it when I said that
C	typing
A	accent or something no I said it on the phone like
C	oh right okay oh well
B	oh yeah
A	but it was an automated thing I said
B	does it not confirm? did it not say
A	no
C	no but they can he but the
A	and it says
C	right
A	you've been charged ten pound forty
C	right that's which is fine
B	they're going to know that it's your car though
A	but it I said like
C	well yeah well apart from the end yeah no that's fine
C	he will have checked you presumably that you you'd er telephoned
C	yeah
B	it's an automated system
C	that that's er that that's an automated system and erm voice recognition which has
A	how
C	I dunno
A	it doesn't actually say on there
B	is it sixty but if you don't if you pay it soon it halves
A	like my bus lane
B	it'll be similar
A	thirty quid
B	to the bus lane
C	pay this
A	what?
C	I just well he er dunno if this is the time he came along in which case the obviously you would have registered that
B	he's probably got a target to hit
C	no I I reckon he put would wouldn't he have a machine? and he he put the registration in
B	didn't match up
C	and if and if it didn't match then cos then it it wouldn't even show that she'd she'd put
B	probably
C	they'd just be
B	cos otherwise
C	you know just looking through a list of all list of
B	probably just scans yeah probably just scans doesn't it? doesn't matter
C	or yeah takes
B	or on a computer
A	yeah
C	it's
A	ranting
C	so so that's the reason so that's that's actually quite good because you can er
A	yeah
C	given you a ticket
A	when do
C	you know that actually
A	they're not open till Monday I don't think
C	well it doesn't matter
A	I am
B	I know you are
C	I don't know what
B	except premium rate probably spend fifty pounds trying to call
C	well yes
