A	which books did you have to read for your school exams?
B	well the book we had to read the novel was Great Expectations by Charles Dickens we did the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar and we did some poems a selection of poems quite a few of them were different poems about snow ah one was about a snake I think one of the best ones that I liked the most was a poem called Grantchester by
A	yes do you erm find that it was an inspiring choice of erm books?
B	ah I think Great Expectations is one of the great classics eh of English to read so I am quite glad that I read it although at the time I found that it was a very long book to get through in a year our teacher used to read us erm extracts throughout the year so to make sure that it was all read erm we'd only just finished the book by the time it was a few weeks before the exam I found it quite heavy going in parts a lot of detailed description in it I think that stopped the flow of the story a little bit perhaps for me
A	yes
B	I also found it to be quite complicated plot that doesn't unravel until right at the very end when you realise that you've been lead up a blind alley
B	erm I wasn't so interested in the poems about snow but they were obviously there so that you could compare and contrast the way that different poets talked about snow to try to describe which he found the most effective I liked the poem about Grantchester because I can imagine somebody being away from home maybe in the First World War thinking about the lovely things that they used to do when they lived in a nice village and it was lovely and quiet and wondering whether people were still doing something very civilised like taking tea on the lawn and having some nice honey and it being very quiet and that would contrast with the situation that they're in which was very noisy and violent and dirty and that kind of longing that they would experience for getting back home to that security
A	yes
B	which books did you read?
A	erm for my ah GCSE ah course I read erm
B	yeah
A	and Of Mice and Men
B	yes
A	and erm Inspector Calls really erm I think one of the key themes is to show the erm social erm situation in the Victorian era
B	yes
A	by erm sort of having a complex chain of events between erm working and middle class factory owner
B	mm
A	I think it was trying to indicate that erm social change ah was required
B	mm because people were treated in different ways
A	yes
B	yes
A	I don't think Of Mice and Men particularly erm contrasted it that wasn't really the aim
B	no
A	they were just separate publications
B	yes yes
A	obviously Mice and Men is an American based erm novel erm
B	yes
A	it's basically focuses on the sort of the big dream attitude in America that was present in the I think it was the nineteen twenty thirties
B	mm yeah thirties yeah that's right
A	yeah and why two ranch workers who don't have much money
B	mm
A	erm have this vision of having a a plot and a sort of trying to reach self sufficiency
B	yes
A	that was within that sort of basic tale you've got sort of other factors such as one character who is eh very large and strong but not very clever
B	mm
A	a slim weaker figure who you know some ways almost acts like a father figure to the other character who is Leonard
B	mm yes Lenny
A	but yet they ah sort of have such close connections with one another I think they really have a strong friendship bond
B	yes yes
A	I also erm had a the Moon Over the Tides poetry he which is oh yeah
B	yes he did didn't he? most enjoyable wasn't it?
A	collection of war poems that were intended to compare with one another
B	yes yes one good thing about the Of Mice and Men book was that it was quite a slim volume wasn't it?
A	yes yes
B	so I think it only had about six chapters
A	mm I think it's just over a hundred pages
B	yeah so it was very readable wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	and you know you could remember the whole story
A	mm
B	in one go another good thing is that there was a DVD to watch
A	yes
B	which was very close virtually word for word to the text wasn't it?
A	yes
B	so that gave a really good visual picture for you to follow as well didn't it?
A	but also if you look at your case with Great Expectations you can only you'd struggle to read the book once and
B	mm yes that's right yes yes even the film of a Great Expectations is quite long to watch all in one go
A	yes yes I think the poems were erm sort of relatively erm a challenging aspect I think there's quite a lot of opinion in some ways of whether the contrast or whether they erm sort of making these comparisons as well as trying to dig out different literary techniques
B	mm yes
A	I think erm it's quite difficult to do when sort of poems have been written in different circumstances for different wars even
B	yes they were weren't they? yes
A	but I do feel that does need to be some well more or less that is a correct analysis erm but I I don't think sort of English erm sort of works in that logical approach as much
B	mm what do you think the fact that
A	yes
B	and because I think a lot of people enjoy reading it
A	I
B	no
A	but obviously I think he would be probably better if he considered a sort of adding to the range of books rather than
B	yes
A	compete the same you can't read that one
B	no yes when I was at school my English teacher used today if a book's worth reading it's worth reading twice
A	yes
B	but I must say I've never read Great Expectations twice
A	no
B	I think it would take a long time
A	yes so do
A	so do you think length is also a factor? If a good good short book was worth reading would that be read twice?
A	but a good long book
B	I have read a couple of books twice and it's surprising how when you read it the second time it feels quite different
A	yes
B	you seem to get a different
A	handle
B	yeah reading of it when you go for the second reading yes
A	yes erm are you intending to eh read any further material soon or?
B	erm well I have read another Dickens book which was A Christmas Carol which I did like as well and I've watched a couple of other DVDs and about Dickens and serialised Dickens books on the television which was how he originally intended them to be read in instalments so I think there was quite erm a tradition on Sunday afternoon teatimes of having serialised episodes like Dickens
A	poetry
B	yeah
A	yes but obviously er I think there will be a certain amount of theory in it er er but obviously er I don't think it will have any comparisons to poetry
B	mm yes no
A	you might come across a a mnemonic to remember a certain theory or something but I don't think it
B	a mnemonic yes no yes I think erm it was quite a good choice really the books that you had and
A	yes
B	the DVD of An Inspector Calls I thought that was very atmospheric it's not very often now that we see a DVD or a film in black and white
A	no
B	but I think it worked quite effectively
A	yes
B	for that story because it was set er quite far back and because it was a bit sort of spooky wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	there's some ambiguity about who the inspector is whether he's some kind of ghost or whether it's somebody's conscience or so that gave it a bit of atmosphere I think shooting it in black and white
A	I thought it was interesting that erm revisited the erm Alabama Theatre in
B	Alhambra
A	to eh
B	yes
A	watch An Inspector Calls
B	yes that bring it to life a bit more
A	yes
B	yes
A	yes
B	I haven't actually come across that play before you encountered it at school I thought it was really worthwhile doing it and I really enjoyed the story
A	yes
B	but erm I think if I just seen it on a television schedule I wouldn't have thought to watch it perhaps really glad to be introduced to it I thought it was really interesting
A	no yes I think it's a good idea of erm when you're studying a book if you can try and see the erm film or go to a theatre
B	yes the production
A	see a live production of it
B	yes I think it really does bring it to life doesn't it which is how it was intended to be presented as a play
A	yes
B	rather than read in a classroom out of a book
A	yes I think one of the funniest things which erm wasn't really a set piece of the erm data production
B	mm
A	was that one of the people were walking down the steps
B	yes
A	erm I think it was the erm the inspector
B	mm
B	oh right I bet I bet some people thought that was the best part but did he soon regain his balance and his composure?
A	he did yes
B	my gosh poor chap I bet he won't do that again he'll be extra careful now
A	yes must have been slightly embarrassing
B	it would wouldn't it? yes and were the other people who were in the play laughing about it? or were they keeping in character?
A	I think they just about managed not to laugh
B	some quiet sniggers
A	yes
B	yeah oh dear
A	I supposed it adds to that an element of originality
B	oh it does yeah it's very authentic isn't it?
A	yes
B	yes
A	erm in some ways the theatre is not something that we sort of visit too much of
B	no I haven't been too frequently I must admit
A	yeah I think the last thing we all saw was The Nutcracker
B	oh yes yes we did go to see The Nutcracker the ballet didn't we one Christmas
A	yes
B	that was nice though wasn't it?
A	it was
B	yeah the disappointment for me was that there wasn't a real live orchestra that it was just piped music wasn't it?
A	yeah I I think there was a small number hidden under the stage I wasn't sure whether that was a real orchestra or not
B	was there? oh right yes yes I think that's a lovely thing to see at Christmas don't you?
A	it is
B	yes is there anything else that you would like to see in the future?
A	erm I think one thing that theatres do too much is that the sort of happy like more contemporary kind of like ah comedy shows that type of thing
B	mm
A	I don't I'm not really interested in that sort of thing
B	what would you like to see?
A	well sort of maybe I don't know a take on a a classic or just a classic itself
B	mm yes yes
A	you in that league as well or
B	yes I think I'd be more interested in that than something more contemporary
A	have you any ideas of what you would like to see or?
B	no well I haven't really been following what's on offer have we?
A	no
B	I think maybe people watch the television more than go to the theatre now
A	yes
B	and it be probably quite expensive to get the tickets
A	yes I think sometimes they do some like bargain deals but
B	yes
A	not as frequently as you might want
B	no
A	but I think there is an element of thrill of going to the theatre
B	yes it is it does have a different atmosphere because it's more of an occasion isn't it?
A	yeah it is
B	than just sitting in front of the television
A	yes
B	or DVDs
A	mm
B	so they're both probably have their place don't they?
A	yeah I'm not sure whether erm theatres are as popular as they used to be or
B	no I don't think so
B	yes it would be a half hour drive probably wouldn't it? yes
A	yes yeah
B	I'd quite like to see more ballets I think
A	yes there's erm Black is it Swan?
B	Swan Lake?
A	Swan Lake is that a ballet?
B	yes I've seen that one I've seen Swan Lake and I've seen erm
A	yes
B	and The Nutcracker when I took you
A	yes
B	yes it would we'll have to keep an eye open
A	yes
B	see what's advertised
A	yes
B	for you yes I thought they were very good I thought they were more accessible than the ones that I had and I was very pleased with the choice yes with both of them I thought they were more interesting to read
A	yes
B	and eh we'd more or less read them hadn't well you'd read them in the holidays didn't you so you made a good start
A	yes yeah
B	yes I was really pleased with the choice
A	I think ah in my A level course it's definitely been more sort of academic books
B	mm
A	like for example the French Revolution element who were buying books that were written by academics
B	yes well that's more factual and textbooks isn't it?
A	it is more factual
B	than something that you would read like a novel
A	yes
B	yes
A	I thought that some of them were relatively densely eh written
B	mm certainly were
A	I think if you did get a quote from a well-known academic I think it'd give it a little erm yes
B	bit more authenticity
A	yes
A	yes
A	I think it
B	yes yes it's a very widely read candidate is this one
A	yes
B	yes gives a bit of kudos doesn't it?
A	it does I think it's interesting that erm I do not have a reading list to starting my course and
B	no that's right so said that'll probably come in the second week so
A	yes
B	I'm quite glad in some ways because it gives you a complete break over the summer holidays which I think is well deserved and well needed and that you can start afresh in September
A	it does yes
B	and they'll be able to advise you better which books are necessary and which books you might like to get if you want a couple of extras
A	yes
B	so
A	I seem to get the impression that they erm want you to be very selective about which books you choose I think they're almost going to say which books they want you to get
B	yes yes well I think that's a good idea really and hopefully all the information that you need or the majority of the information will be at your fingertips then won't it?
A	it will yes you had quite an extensive reading list for your higher education
B	yes I did quite a lot of them were not very obtainable some of them were published in nineteen thirty something when I was going round all the second-hand books trying to get them and then I read them and then when I got there they were never mentioned so
A	that must have been a disappointment
B	I
B	I doubt it
A	that's one advantage now is that erm it's much easier to obtain books
B	it is yeah that's right
A	and usually at a better price
B	yes yes absolutely though you
A	yes which one is better
B	reading the books I think yeah
