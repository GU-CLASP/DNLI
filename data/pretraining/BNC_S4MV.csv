A	that's it it's recording
B	okay
A	I dunno if it's gonna be
B	yeah
A	it doesn't have to be
B	erm so shall I tell you about my erm ditching someone?
A	yeah
B	so
A	why?
B	so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there was this girl called
B	in Germany and erm so she was the one who me and
A	right
B	and we'd met them at somebody else's party
B	no we'd met them at someone else's party
A	and wasn't
B	yeah the bloke the husband was English
A	was one of them English?
B	German
A	right
B	when I say we met them at someone else's party it makes it sound like we had a real social life
A	oh
B	and we met this couple
A	right
B	and then because of the husband I joined book club
B	and then erm
A	why did you join it because of him? just cos he said I've got I go to book club do you wanna come?
B	well I just I'd been looking for a book club and I was like what? you go to book club? I'm coming and that's
A	mm
B	when I read Perfume erm anyway so
A	sorry to keep interrupting you did you keep going to book club?
B	I did I went for at least five books erm and I really really enjoyed all of them we did
A	mm
B	erm what's that one? have you read any Ernest Hemmingway?
A	erm
B	the one where he catches the big fish?
A	no
B	by the way you know for this recording thing
B	erm
A	once you get going I'll be able to interject with a bit of er
B	yeah
B	well so basically we started going they invited us round for dinner with this other couple
A	did you ever like them?
B	yeah that first night was really great and we all got on really well and even though I like to go to bed early it was like one AM before I knew it and all this stuff
B	and then I said at the time oh I got
B	erm and it felt like oh new friends
B	and so they all went yeah let's come round and play Frankfurt Monopoly so erm
A	okay
B	so me and her met for coffee or a drink or dinner or whatever
A	I know yeah one 0 one
B	come on guys get out the way
B	doing it I'm doing it I'm doing it
A	go on go on
B	do I need to go even one more?
A	yes
B	I'm not sure maybe I can still be in this one
A	why?
B	erm because he's got four children already
A	mm
B	and and I want my children to have been privileged as well and she said I don't wanna be like
A	it's fair enough
B	and cover all the kids kind of thing
A	yeah
B	and so we went on and on and on like this for hours where she was like he's the guy for me but I just don't know if I can do this
A	mm
B	and it's fair enough like it was a genuine problem but then she would sit there and go he's definitely the right guy for me and I would be like well then there's your answer I'm
A	yeah
B	and erm anyway she did marry him in the end but the thing is that she I would meet her and she would she would thrash this problem out
A	again and again and again
B	or
B	it's just that after I left her and went home I just felt drained of all energy you know how I think I hope that when we talk about stuff it's funny
A	yeah
B	so we just go oh my god my life is so shit ha ha ha you know whereas with her it was like I was drained and depressed after I met her so even though she's really nice I started to think oh shit I don't really want to meet her erm and then with the couples thing when we were meeting
A	mm
B	her bloke
A	chatting
B	chatting and and being in their in group and
A	really?
B	and I just thought do you know what? I just don't even wanna and the thing is though
A	do you believe that that happened?
B	well that's a whole other topic
A	because just that it just occurred to me cos sometimes
B	I know cos you sort of think unless you were there and could she have misunderstood?
A	that's it but then do you know her well enough this girl to to know if?
B	well the problem with
A	that didn't happen
B	or
B	oh also he hadn't told
A	don't think so
B	and
A	see that is weird innit?
B	they had a row in the front of the car and
A	what was the row though like? what can you
B	oh sixty-five okay
A	but does the row go?
B	I think
A	that he hadn't said anything
B	and it fits in with the story of him hugging her from behind and stuff
A	cos all of this stuff when you hear these stories I think aren't it's all a little bit like a soap opera like you can't believe it actually goes that people do things like this but then I know that they do
B	I know but you can't believe it can you?
A	no I can't believe like
B	but guess what? guess how he got together with
A	oh
B	she
A	oh
B	this is so so hilarious erm
B	but yeah he had a he had an affair with
A	cos of it
B	cos of it
B	cos I said at one point to
A	she left him
B	he had an affair with
A	oh
B	and then he just stayed with
A	mm
B	I would try and tell her my stuff and it would make me feel worse about my stuff instead of like when I talk to you and I feel like
A	why did it make you feel worse?
B	I can't explain it's like the the dynamic between us
A	is not good
B	it didn't didn't work even though you just can't force it can you? am I still on the one 0 one?
B	maybe this chatting thing is a bad idea
B	erm
A	yeah we're going the right way it's four five seven no it's four six seven
B	oh my goodness
A	we've only got about another ten junctions
A	is this gonna be like a half an hour trip?
B	supposed to be three hours
A	oh it's so expansive America is fantastic
B	yeah
A	god bless America
B	I I ditched her
A	did ya?
B	cos I just did it I didn't wanna meet her
A	don't worry cos when she's had the baby she wouldn't have had time to talk to you anyway
B	but she still did she used to text and go do you wanna meet up?
A	what even when she had the baby?
B	yeah shall we have a drink? do you wanna meet up? shall we go for a coffee?
B	yeah bless her I did text her in January and said erm by the way it was really terrible but like I used my situation to get out of it so when she was always texting and me always saying no at one point I said to her look me and
A	oh
B	and I felt a bit bad do you know what I mean? cos I was like getting out of it that way but it was true
A	well
B	but it was also partly cos partly I didn't wanna see anyone
A	yeah
B	but also partly I definitely didn't wanna see her and it's
A	yeah
B	didn't didn't click
B	so I did text her in January and say erm I'm like in the UK now and I've left so bye
A	all the best
B	but bless her she replied
A	ah
B	cos I was thinking you know when you work yourself up and think they're gonna be annoyed
A	yeah
B	and they're gonna like
A	ah
B	but she but she said oh
A	ah
B	and erm and it would be lovely to keep in touch and all this stuff so I was like ah
A	it's really sweet
B	so what do you think?
A	but it's not
B	is it a good example?
A	yeah but I think erm you've always been a lot better at that anyway like
B	just not seeing people yeah
A	I think you always just not don't care yeah don't really really care
B	was it
A	I think it might have been
B	yeah and it just was a she was lovely but it was a nothingy friendship because
A	you were you was already starting to get a bit arsy about things like this years ago like
B	yeah
A	couldn't be bothered
B	yeah it just wasn't enough of a friendship so and the thing is I can't when I was in Frankfurt it wasn't like I could go oh I'd better meet up with
A	I think that's good though I think that strength of character when you have the
B	yeah
A	a genuine thing and I'd rather be
B	it doesn't fill me with joy the thought of doing it
B	mm
A	it's only really been in the last year or so
B	yeah
A	and all and you start to really evaluate what who you're spending time with and all the rest of it and it's amazing it was with me it was all to do with with
B	yeah
A	and who you can talk to
B	quality time
A	and what's the point in all the rest of it? what is the point?
B	yeah
A	and now but the worst part of it is not the worst part of it at all in fact it's been wonderful but
A	it has been wonderful because it's obviously sort of mutual with my ones because
B	yeah
A	I haven't heard from them either
B	I think that's that's quite a key point whether it's mutual or not
A	yeah
B	cos I always feel like I think I'm like attracting people even more by being a bit erm aloof
A	yeah
B	and it's not what I'm trying to do but it's like making them keener and then I sort of think why do you wanna meet up with me? cos I'm awful
B	I'm a terrible person
B	and I don't listen it's not like I remember what your problems are
B	just waiting for you to shut up
B	but by the way a key point is what about this feeling of obligation that that you get with some people? so it's like oh I should meet them and like and I should this and I should that cos I had another friend in Frankfurt
A	mm
B	but she got really clingy really quickly so
A	mm mm
B	she only works up the road so we used to meet for
A	ah
B	so we like our we click you know
A	yeah yeah
B	and erm we had another couple of those we were in a restaurant and I couldn't stop laughing so we used to meet for lunch on a Friday and it was really nice
A	yeah
B	and then one time just one time I I agreed to go for a drink in the evening which for me was a really big deal
A	mm
B	and erm I actually let myself go and we stayed out till like one
B	but the problem was this opened up something in
B	and erm but the thing is she started saying things when we met up like erm I think we need to meet up more often
A	oh
B	so I would like to see you in a few weeks and I was a bit like
A	oh what a shame
B	erm
A	yeah
B	even though I really like her
A	this is the thing I think some people
B	yeah
A	it has the opposite effect because don't you think though that's the most simple thing in the world ever? this was this would be your total worst nightmare and it doesn't happen any more but my friend
A	and she would guilt you and it's only cos I've been friends with her so long and I didn't realise it was happening and it crept up on me but in the end it got to a really bad level of guilting you if you didn't go and see her
A	and then I went round to see
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't stop
B	sorry sorry
A	four seven nine
B	it it could it be the one? cos
A	take exit four seven nine for
B	but I just wonder if if the
B	is like below where we're going so we are we are going past
A	I think then it doesn't matter like you can go either
B	oh oh hang on
A	does that mean we're on the one one six?
B	no I think it's like well I hope not
A	so we don't get on it
B	I wonder if the one that they're sending us on if on their sign is the one one six?
B	no I mean on there
A	oh right
B	is it still on?
A	is it still on? it's probably
B	oh
A	yeah no don't worry about that I mean that's fine it's more you've gotta be
B	this is typical me chatting and I missed the exit
A	but we didn't miss it
B	we didn't did we?
A	no no
B	so even though it says four seven nine
A	yeah
B	I
A	I bet it is
B	what
A	we're about due for the four seven nine almost
B	yeah
A	perhaps it's just a really
A	got three three things to go that's exit four seven four seven six
B	by the way just really quickly there was one other thing about meeting up with
A	yeah
B	and I started to feel like it was an empty friendship because we got on and everything but we didn't have any any common experience
A	you said that to me once that's what makes people friends like it's when you've done stuff
B	like me and you we worked together then we did like
A	holidays
B	drinks together and went out together and
A	yeah
B	I don't know if it's the holiday that cemented it all though or whether we would have been fine even without a holiday
A	I think when you've when you've been friends with and it's work or it's studying or school or something I think that's when you sort friends cos you really you're not just on your best behaviour over dinner like for an hour and a half or something
B	yeah
A	but you've really got to see to know them a bit so I think that's
A	yeah
B	and I think that's why I had a bit of a problem with
A	that's alright innit?
A	I think that looks really good
B	it would be nice to do just a sort of like
A	stuck
B	yeah
A	we could just pull and say I wanna stay here cos there's it's so vast isn't it?
B	yeah
A	so they've gotta have erm
A	this is a little bit like Austria or something don't you think? it reminds me of Austria
B	yeah
B	it sort of feels
A	it's it
B	cos we can't tell how long it is till the thing
A	let's wait until we've got onto that bit
B	okay
A	that was a lovely cookie by the way
A	yeah
B	Wisbit?
A	oh
B	on television?
A	er
B	that
A	that erm little triangle thing
B	oh yeah
A	you remember?
A	woo hoo
B	is that it?
A	left onto
B	oh
A	oh is it?
B	did it say one mile?
A	yeah
B	I hope it says
A	in the bag?
B	don't know they're in your erm
A	oh
A	no this is fab all of it
B	right here we go
B	I really hope that it that it might
A	two out of three's not bad
B	eh
B	ah so probably this is where we go left
A	there was a vineyard back there
B	oh yeah we're in wine country I forgot
B	right driving on the right
A	remember yeah I would have totally gone
B	what's the next thing? cos I think it's really soon the next turn
A	go onto
B	what was the
A	turn right onto
B	I think this is
A	this is lovely
B	we're accidently in wine in wine country
A	right onto
B	okay excellent
A	mm
B	look at this it's hilarious
A	beautiful
A	left onto
B	oh okay that's when we're at the coast
A	eh
B	yeehaa
A	mm
B	mm
A	you probably could I mean
B	yeah
A	when you're hungry and you want to stop for something
B	maybe there'll be a diner where we could have a coffee
A	oh man
B	maybe maybe this is it?
B	no
A	it'll tell us
B	mm
A	oh
A	left onto
B	is that
B	driving on the right so I don't know what to do about him
A	just
B	go?
A	oh lovely look
A	I I actually
B	do you feel like it's not enough of an adventure? cos I've written down all of the directions
A	well it was either write it was probably either too much erm
B	the thing is
A	let's see what happens
B	if you do the adventure way where you don't know where you're going it's fun to a point and then you start to get pissed off
A	yeah when you when you
A	ah
B	yeah
A	right onto
B	we could maybe stop at
A	could do
B	for the diner experience
A	we're doing very good for time
B	oh my god it's like summer ah
A	spring innit? it's proper spring now
B	ah
B	this reminds me of when I was a waitress in the south of France for some reason cos even there's pine trees that's why
A	I can't smell pine trees
B	cos even though it was a horrendous experience
A	oh it's a bit cold
B	I actually it was still a wonderful adventure
A	why were you there again?
B	that was my short story do you remember?
A	yeah I do I do remember it but I can't remember why you were doing that now like what was the in between bit?
B	to practise my French
A	can you speak French as well?
B	well
A	but you can obviously
B	but I can yeah
A	because you went there to practise it
B	oh
A	er
B	oh I really like it here
A	it's proper American innit?
B	I missed that sign there was a sign saying happy birthday to somebody like a proper sign with letters on
A	look at those verandas what people sit out on oh look at this it's stunning
B	this is crazy
B	you see I I I totally feel like I
A	I don't think it's that dissimilar to
B	yeah
A	I know it's a bit more vast and bumpy but
B	but do you know what? I mean somewhere where it's away and it's a bit like remote that's what I like
A	why is that
B	no I know I think it's fantastic
A	yeah
B	course I'd probably do it and then go ah
A	could murder a latte
B	yeah
A	that's why really and truly what I think I would like is somewhere a bolt hole like we were talking about somewhere
B	yeah so then you could have a boat
A	would you live on a boat? real boat?
A	would you? yeah but
B	I'd like that
A	I'd find them a bit claustrophobic
B	my friend is thinking about buying a houseboat but she said to me it's it's the opposite of when you property you know when you buy property it's an investment houseboat's just
A	what houseboats do?
B	mm apparently I can't remember the full story but you know what I mean
A	I can see that yeah yeah
B	it'd probably be something to do for a week wouldn't it?
A	and then you'd get sick of it
A	thank god I didn't actually buy one
A	have you been to the New Forest
B	er I can't remember I don't think so I think I've gone past it can you just remind me where it is again?
A	New Forest?
B	mm
A	Hampshire Hampshire
B	okay
B	let's not speak too soon I guess we'll find out we're completely
A	oh it's lovely though isn't it? just lovely
B	so do you think this is the wine country? I don't know if we're like driving through Sonoma County which is like all wine stuff I dunno
A	don't know
B	yeah
A	very
B	I'm driving on the right yes exactly
B	yeah
A	I didn't think it'd be so farm like
B	well actually I was worried that it would be mountain passes
A	mind you this is we're not on it though are we? we've gotta get back on the the motorway
B	I think we're still we're still on that
A	yeah
B	I wonder if we've missed the
A	I'm enjoying it too much to
B	yeah
A	let's just keep going
B	see where we end up
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	we've done loads of trips
B	oh
A	oh piss off
B	I don't wanna get into the
A	oh is that skunk?
B	actually I'm just gonna check because on here I had how many miles it was to the turn off
A	mm? what? no?
