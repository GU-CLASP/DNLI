B	thank you
A	thank you
B	oh I've got
A	mm
B	okay so two salmons
A	mm
B	mm
A	there's a very large number of forks
B	ha ha we won't run out
C	okay
C	has everybody got what they need?
A	yeah
B	yes yeah
A	erm
C	what are those two I'd prefer
A	eh? Er which one do you want to start with?
C	salmon
A	smoked or normal?
B	so that one's?
C	smoked
B	mm
A	um in that case I will
B	do you want one of those or shall I have the other one?
C	you don't want tea?
A	er I don't but
B	erm I'm alright for the minute I'll I'll stick with water for the minute
C	you'd like tea?
B	um I I'm alright for the minute thanks I'll I'll just have water
A	maybe I'm slightly counter-intuitive
B	um
A	okay
B	did you? Or did you want?
A	I don't mind trying one of those
B	okay cool
A	I'm gonna start with a wrap
B	and see how hungry you are after that
A	mm
A	yeah I know then I thought actually I have no idea how to do that
B	yeah
A	do you wanna try?
B	no
A	the only thing that comes to mind is the inappropriate song from Friends
B	ha
A	exactly
B	mm
A	sorry?
B	you know a bit of Eminem?
A	who?
B	Don't you?
A	no
A	I actually didn't understand a word of that
B	it's about Moby who is
A	who's this chap?
B	eminem
A	oh I was thinking Moby but actually yes
B	oh yeah
A	like a robot?
B	ha
A	well that was truly awful
B	what was? The robot?
A	computerised human  computerised human  electronic secret enforcer
B	hm
A	erm
B	or it'd be chess
A	ego boosting
B	yeah
A	it's interesting in Friends though because they mock cos it's quite clever a lot of it but they but but they seem to mock cos well they don't mock Ross for being intelligent necessarily
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	so I guess yeah that it's not intelligent it's the fact that he chose to use that in a particular way
A	yeah
B	I mean it is quite funny being a palaeontologist like that is moderately reasonable
A	nice friends
B	pardon? Yeah exactly yeah
A	in all fairness he is a pain in the arse
B	yeah
A	as in you should realise that you don't
B	yeah
A	no no they're interested in that but when he's actually saying what was in it
B	mm
A	yes exactly
A	erm
C	nobody else wants tea er at the moment?
B	no thank you
A	no thanks
B	would you like some cornflakes?
A	not currently
B	no no I mean
A	well there a bit tasteless actually I think I remember something and of course it was here that I learn to mix cereal so I have that crunchy stuff on top of cornflakes
B	oh nice
A	it's exciting
B	it's very
A	living it large
B	I was going to say yeah
A	loving it loving it
B	but um
A	Don't know why that came into my head
B	what was I going to say? Um
A	I feel slightly weird today
B	yea
A	mm
B	bizarre hot day
A	erm
C	oh dear
B	you alright?
C	it's alright
B	oh right
A	see making tea is dangerous
B	yeah
A	that's why I don't have tea
B	what cos of the dangers?
A	yes
B	except when you pour salt
A	yeah
B	yeah no you're not allowed to
A	someone just nicked my hand with like a wire cutter
B	yeah
A	I don't mind that this happened
B	yeah
A	if I was self-harming
B	yeah
A	then maybe that's a separate issue but
B	if you're not bothered yeah
A	yeah
B	okay
A	right um
B	oh
A	brilliant
B	yes er
A	um tomatoes olives or anchovies? Oh not anchovies
B	they're
C	I'd be a bit careful
A	mm
A	oh
B	hmm hmm
A	seriously it's like a structural element to the sandwich
B	nice
A	mm
B	mm
A	so we were walking through
B	um
A	yeah it would have been last Friday
B	okay
A	and we were meaning to go to this erm fish
C	A
A	an Iranian restaurant
C	mm mm
A	which was different
B	it was really good but one of those things you never expect to end up doing
A	mm
B	but it was  it was  nice
C	and what did you have there?
B	um
A	um
B	we had er for starter it was kind of um bread and dips and things like that and then we had two they were both chicken dishes I think
A	mm
B	um but it's not like Indian food
A	mm
B	and it was like served with rice
A	mm
B	hmm
A	which was bizarre
A	I think I might have one of these
B	yeah
A	iced gold in fact
C	oh
A	it's really cool
B	mm
A	hmm
B	one of those or ham
A	okay
B	do you want another roast chicken one or?
A	um pick choose whatever you want I'll go with the flow
B	wouldn't mind a ham one
A	go for it
A	mm cos what we're doing at the moment is essentially it's designing what I can only describe as a crossbow
A	um
A	hmm
A	it's not actually a cross bow
B	I know but
A	it's sort of about this big
B	oh okay quite big then
A	mm
C	and what part do you take playing it?
A	target
B	I was gonna say I'm not involved
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I'm quite scared that we're doing it
A	Cos it's gonna take in total erm about fifty kilos of force to cock this
B	mm
A	mm
B	I'll just sit on the end of it for you
A	it wouldn't exactly work
B	that'd be a lot of effort
A	mm
B	so there's ham salmon chicken
A	I think I might have a second chicken
B	yeah it's fine
A	mm
B	mm
C	pardon?
B	my sister's going to come down and do some work experience in my office next week
C	right
B	so she's coming to stay with us which will be it'll be nice
A	she's she's arriving tomorrow
C	is she older or younger?
B	younger
A	I take it you're going to be bossing her around
B	ha ha
A	mm
C	oh as a pupil or teaching?
A	mm
C	oh?
B	she's um as an undergraduate yeah
C	oh
B	she's um yeah so and she's kind of thinking about what she wants to do afterwards so she's gonna come down have a look have a go at publishing and she what she thinks see if she thinks it's a
C	what do you think you want to do?
B	what does she think she wants to do?
C	what?
B	what does she think she wants to do yeah?
C	mm
B	um
A	she's a little bit what you call work shy
A	um
B	but she she might find that she really likes publishing
A	if there's a lot of tea and cake I suspect she'll love it
B	mm mm
A	oh dear
B	huh huh
A	could we not just employ her in the house as a domestic servant?
B	no
A	mm mm
C	have you
A	no actually
C	oh
A	um
C	yeah I didn't know it was Mother's Day
A	ah
B	last night
A	the last
B	she was a bit cross
A	A bit miffed I think would be a better description
B	mm
A	erm so erm
A	okay it's six erm
B	mm
A	so we were cos last Sunday we went er a couple of friends we went walking in Derbyshire
C	ah we've done that many times
B	mm
A	well there's a old railway line that runs between Buxton and
B	Bakewell
A	Bakewell
B	mm
A	um but um
A	yeah it was terrifying erm
C	I used to know all that part of the world very well
B	mm
A	Cos you grew up in
C	yeah
B	mm
A	we found this place called um
B	oh I can't remember
A	yeah it's like someone built a town on the bottom of a canyon
B	mm
A	something
C	pardon?
A	something it was
B	yeah
A	it'll be on the road atlas
B	mm
A	it was bizarre
B	mm
A	and it had a huge um abandoned what presumably was a cotton mill
B	mm mill yeah mill yeah
A	um which sort of Victorian hang over which had been turned into a big shopping market
B	mm
A	erm
B	one salmon and one chicken wrap
A	I told you we'd need this many
B	mm mm
A	not hugely
B	mhm
A	erm
C	pardon?
A	would you like another sandwich?
C	er no thank you
B	mm
C	I've I've got some sweet er if you want
A	oh we've bought some as well
B	mm
A	we've bought that as well
C	oh
A	very well prepared
B	we've got some fruit salad for later
A	I'm not sure I actually want to have a full one
B	mm
A	I think we did too
B	mm
A	I'm glad you agree
B	yes
A	sure?
B	yes
A	oh no go ahead
B	no that's that's fine
A	no go on go on go on
B	ah
A	go on go on go on
B	ha ha you're turning into Mrs Doyle
A	go on Mrs Doyle
B	hm hm
A	erm
B	ah
A	and so that was quite erm entertaining last weekend
B	mm
A	erm and then set off sort of earlyish on Sunday
B	but it was good
A	mm
B	it was nice to see somewhere new and you know go somewhere somewhere different
C	mm
A	mm
C	it's near what?
A	near
C	yeah what did you say?
A	er
C	no I don't know
A	erm
B	mm
A	and um they've just got a new one though just finished converting
C	mm
B	we're looking forward to that
A	yeah
B	so we need to  need to  book that
A	if it's not raining
B	it probably will be raining but
A	so you're essentially sitting in a bath outside with an umbrella
C	ha
A	which I'm keen for
B	I suppose if you're already wet then
A	exactly how much wetter can you get?
B	yeah
A	so that's going to be um yeah hopefully quite relaxing cos we haven't had any leave yet this year
B	yeah
A	um
B	mm
A	erm ooh and I did I think I told you about my Channel swimming plans
C	no
A	in that case I this the goal for this summer was to do a Channel swim
A	which is a bit of an issue
B	rather than insane
C	it's very cold the Channel
A	well it's warmer than pretty much anywhere else around here
C	really?
A	well it's warmer than the North Sea
C	no no no the Channel is supposed to be very cold
A	oh great
C	oh yes
B	pretty cold
A	um
C	well I think it's always running the water isn't it through the Channel
A	oh okay
C	one way or the other that keeps it cold
B	oh right
A	yeah and it also slows you down because you sort of have to swim diagonally
C	mm
A	um as if you would if you were in a boat um
C	Good gracious
A	erm and you also have to pay the coastguard five hundred pounds to stop cargo ships hitting you
B	yeah
C	yes
B	it's just it turns out to be really expensive
C	mm
B	you've gotta
A	well you shouldn't
B	you shouldn't yeah
A	I mean er it's generally like
C	but don't they have occasions when it it's sort of a mass swim the Channel
A	no
C	they used to have
A	really?
C	mm
B	ah
A	because only how many of those people died? Because there was only about sort of it's less than a thousand people who have ever done it in history
C	oh no I don't think so
A	well there's a record kept like the first
C	in in in my youth it was the best sort of popular swim
B	maybe it wasn't officially registered
A	maybe it was a
B	maybe they just used to get in a do it
C	oh yes
A	because the first person that did it
C	I don't know if it was a Captain
A	was it Captain something?
C	pardon?
A	it was captain in the Army
C	mm
B	was it?
A	erm
B	mm
A	erm
C	really?
A	erm
C	that there is very cold
A	I know
C	yes I was swimming in
B	ah
A	really?
C	and
A	well actually I'll show you some photos after lunch of er us up there
C	and the one what's the one in the south the erm west corner?
C	no
A	er
B	the
A	er the I'm not sure
B	I'm not sure
C	I think it's one of the largest lakes it's sort of like a
B	erm
A	road atlas?
C	pardon?
A	road atlas?
C	no
A	that'd probably tell us
B	yeah cos
A	mm
B	hmm?
C	it's not
A	no it
B	that's
A	that that's moderately small
B	yeah we do
A	oh I don't know you've got a road atlas
B	I will actually clean a bit off yeah
A	you clear up I'll do the next course erm
B	er shall I just get rid of these
A	er maybe why not?
C	oh
A	er what am I looking for? Yeah we've got some fruit and some chocolaty things which erm are weird
C	mm
B	they're sort of chocolate marshmallow and raisins
A	and raisins
C	the marshmallow please
A	no it er they're mixed
C	oh
A	as in you can try getting the marshmallow out if you like
B	probably a bit sticky
A	it might be a bit of an effort
B	can we have some  can we have some  bowls just for the fruit
A	oh yes indeed
B	er where?
A	erm Grandpa bowls?
C	pardon?
A	bowls for fruit?

B	is that quite big?
A	sort of
B	mm
C	that isn't much room is it there?
B	yeah
A	that's also not much good
A	that's really disconcerting having the Isle of Man there on a different scale
C	no they haven't
A	wast Water apparently
B	mm
C	I'm ashamed of myself I don't know the Lake District like the back of my hand
A	see I don't know it at all

C	Coniston aren't we?
A	oh we found that but we were just trying to find the other erm lake that you were thinking about
C	oh
A	tell you what shall we have the next course and we can have a look after lunch?

B	mm yeah
A	erm It's quite good cos it tells you your blood group and stuff
A	well
B	if it means you keep coming back then you know they can't complain too much
A	well it doesn't brilliantly thrill me but it's like my way of making it you know sort of not unpleasant so
B	mm
A	you you'd think they'd be more supportive
B	hmm mm
A	hmm
C	do you want some milk on that?
B	I'm fine thank you
A	no
A	mm mm
B	melon
A	mm mm?
B	the melon's not right
A	oh
B	the two foods that I really don't like
A	unless caviar or melon
B	unless it's caviar
A	you'd be surprised if you were in a situation in which you found it's a problem
B	having said that I would use caviar but yeah melon is just an issue
C	would you like some ice cream?
B	no no I'm fine thank you
A	I thought you were gonna say caviar then
C	well it's the best ice cream
A	hmm
A	right so last night we all went out for a Mother's Day meal essentially
B	mm
A	um and had a very good time
A	mm mm
C	I think er Norway is as good as anywhere
B	oh
A	you can get the ferry
B	you can get the ferry over
A	now when you went did you take your own car or?
C	yes
B	mm mm yeah
A	mm
C	Newcastle to well there's two
A	Bergen isn't it?
B	mm
C	sometimes to Bergen
B	oh okay
C	and then you could stay on it and go up to Bergen
A	Oslo?
C	no Oslo's in a different country isn't it
A	I'm fairly sure Oslo is the capital of
B	was it oh oh Oslo's the capital I think
A	it's like round the corner
C	yes mm
A	I don't think it's in Sweden though
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah
A	and it's definitely a country sorry capital
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I've probably got some books on Norway
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
C	um
A	the North Pole?
A	actually you can't do that by land from there can you
B	can you?
A	er well er Top Gear drove there
B	oh
C	I I've been there about three or four times
A	the North Pole or Norway?
C	Norway
A	right
B	mm
C	with a car and then motored across Sweden and into Norway
B	lovely
A	that sounds awfully fun
A	of course nowadays which you probably couldn't at the time you could go via Russia
C	mm
A	mm mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	so we start in get the ferry to
A	mm
B	drive to Poland
A	that'd be really cool do a driving circuit
B	wow
A	so you drive down to the Channel
B	mm
A	drive through France Belgium Germany Poland Russia Finland Sweden Norway
C	well I I have done that personally
B	mm
C	driven along the coast to the Baltic states
A	mm mm
C	got a ferry from the Baltic states to Sweden and through Sweden into Norway
B	wow
A	but you missed Finland
C	um
A	okay cool
B	wow
A	mm
C	mm
A	well in Germany they don't have um speed restrictions
B	ha ha you can speed through that bit
A	it'll be much quicker
C	the roads aren't very good for speeding in Norway
C	well though I expect it's different now
A	well
B	mm
A	well that's probably still like Scotland now
C	mm
A	oh I'm pleased he's remembered that I don't take tea
B	yeah
A	sorry?
B	he's really with it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I really want to do a tour
B	mm
A	across go down through Belgium Germany and through Switzerland into North Italy
B	mm mm
A	and then come back via France
B	you mentioned that before
A	expensive
B	mm
A	but er
B	all the fuel
A	not that much of a big deal but it would arguably yeah be cheaper to fly than pay for petrol
B	mm mm
A	which is slightly alarming
B	yeah
A	no erm
B	hmm hmm hmm
A	and landing might be a bit fun but
A	it's all mostly on auto pilot nowadays anyway
B	wasn't specifically meaning you flying but yes
A	well you know on Ryanair you actually have to provide your own pilot don't you?
A	mm
B	twenty pounds return
A	what I'd do is I'd just put on all my clothes
B	well
C	those two are Norway
C	but er
B	oh brilliant
A	it does look rather good doesn't it
B	mountains
A	it has to be said the fashion for glasses at that time wasn't in a good point
C	mm
C	that's Norway
B	ooh
A	Glacier
B	fun slash terror
A	well there's nothing to hit
B	mm
A	spider of some description
C	I think most of these are Norway but that can't tell where
B	ah
C	and that was  that was that was  my car the red one
A	mm
B	very nice
A	I remember that car
C	pardon?
A	I remember being in that car
C	mm oh
A	didn't have any head restraints in the back
B	oh
A	no
B	right
A	well that that would have been one of the first cars to have rear seatbelts
B	hmm
A	that's a
C	that's
A	that's a Volvo two forty isn't it
C	mm
B	oh
A	I think that's one of the best ones
B	mm mm
C	yes they're all Norway
A	actually if you
B	yeah sure
A	I'll just gonna
B	uh-huh what do you want me to do?
A	I don't know that one looks somewhere that's more like Scotland
B	mm
C	you can still go from er go from erm Newcastle
B	huh look
A	yes
B	oh
B	look what it says on the back
A	galloway?
B	galloway
A	I thought that was Scotland
B	I've bene to Gatehouse of Fleet
A	I think it's almost in Scotland
B	right
A	no that's not that's Norway
C	there's no many parts of the world I haven't been to and I think Norway is the best of holiday myself
B	mm
A	bit expensive though
C	yes it always was
B	mm right
C	but mind you you don't spend much money except on petrol
B	okay
C	and I forget what price the petrol was
A	well nowadays that costs a fortune
B	yeah
A	look road ends
B	ha ha crazy golf
A	crazy golf
C	just can't read
B	mm
C	whatever that is
A	I think country highway is a bit of a generous description
B	looks like a track
C	I expect the well the roads will have improved since then
A	mm
B	yeah true
A	but erm yes do you want to describe that time we played mini golf at that zoo
B	oh yeah so we we were at the sort of wildlife park and we decided to have a game of crazy golf
C	yes
B	and Peter didn't like this very much
A	that's not exactly what happened
B	that's my memory of it
A	but ever since then we had a rule where we can't play crazy golf
B	huh huh
C	that's erm
A	yeah
C	yes it is Geiranger
B	ah
C	but I think we went three years in succession I think
A	oh okay
B	oh cool look the back of the boat
C	and we went  we went  North twice and South once
A	it's nineteen eighty-five
B	mm
