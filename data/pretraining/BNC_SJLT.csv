B	oh that's good
A	so it was really useful
B	sounded like everyone wanted the meeting

B	mm
A	I think even though no one had actually responded to me so I didn't know if anyone actually would come with anything to say

A	tut
B	yep
A	what's with that shit?
B	I've no idea
A	has that always been the case?
B	well the only bra that I have from Marks and Spencers is the one I've got on

B	um
B	I mean you can't see it too bad but er I just I can just see like you see the bumps?
A	yeah
B	I just don't want the bumps
A	well you're gonna have to get a T-shirt bra then
B	no they're not
A	so if you're gonna go for pretty that's what's gonna happen
B	yeah
A	it's gonna have detail in it
B	huh
A	so these are
B	so
A	but those are your choices I think
B	it's either this as it is now
A	mm
B	or if I find another one
A	or or you don't have the straps
B	tut
A	you know
B	tried this
A	mm
B	but then because they go on your hips and kind of stick forward a bit don't they
A	mm
B	then you can see a line around the bottom of the dress
A	tut
B	Cos they're not none of them are you know like my
A	mm
A	yeah
B	the they've all got bones in
A	right
B	which you can see
A	what about the zip up one? Is that not an option?
B	no
A	mm

A	mm
B	doesn't stay down
A	tut
B	so as I move it
A	tut
B	tut
B	um

A	that's what I was gonna go for
B	yes

A	so
B	oh I've thought of the big hat with the floppy rim
A	er yeah
B	huh
A	the flopper
B	tut
A	so that would be fine
B	yeah
A	floppy
B	I think actually they might've done one this colour the black
A	yeah
B	mm
A	like that sort of um
B	the flop flop
A	that'd match really well
B	flop
A	flop
B	oh my dad got a really nice letter from my bank yesterday
A	it smells funny
B	yeah
A	why?
B	well they just thought they'd send a letter to my old address
A	but addressed to you though?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah go ahead open it
A	you let your dad open your bank statements?
B	er yeah
A	right
B	er he doesn't care
A	well I think he probably is just a bit worried now isn't he?
B	well no no no
A	right
B	um
A	yeah
B	is that what happened was I went over my overdraft ages ago by a very small amount
A	mm
B	um but it's over by say this is ten pounds
A	yeah
B	um for the month
A	no
B	charged me sixty quid
A	for ten pounds?
B	maybe it's like five pound a day
A	shit
B	that wasn't my overdraft that I signed up for
A	well then you can
B	yeah
A	sue them
B	no
A	thanks love
B	um
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	didn't question it
A	yeah
B	um
A	what?
B	yeah
A	A bank charge?
B	yeah and I was just like oh do you know what? Just fuck this
A	shit
B	so I thought do you know what? I'll just pay it in
A	I've never heard that
B	I can't afford
A	how is that possible?
B	after you can see on my bank account I've put a hundred in then I put two hundred in
A	but charging for what though? Cos you
B	for over your overdraft
A	but you're in your
B	limit
A	but you're in your overdraft
B	no
A	that's sending you over again
B	and then taking me over
A	Jesus
B	yeah
A	Jesus
B	it needs to leave
A	I dunno if you've seen it
B	no
A	um
B	huh
A	is that what you were going for?
B	I'll put my jamas on and remove it
A	um
B	yes
A	yeah
B	so right the way to here
A	yeah
B	which is where I was
A	mhm
B	car hire
A	yeah
B	basically the interest went on at eight pounds
A	mm
B	how I went over my
A	tut
B	with an eight pound
A	but they should've
B	thing
A	they should've flagged that really
B	yeah
A	over your overdraft
B	and then because I was over my overdraft it must be
A	shit
B	to which I was like holy fuck
A	yeah
B	and he said actually you've got another one due
A	shit
B	for a
A	right
B	um
A	then they took a hundred and fifty pounds
B	no no no
A	oh right
B	um
A	shit
B	I put this in
A	yeah
B	thinking right I'm back up to scratch now
A	yeah
B	I can spend some money
A	fuck me
B	yeah
A	so this isn't where your salary goes?
B	no
A	Jesus
B	thank fuck
A	or
B	old current account
A	that you just need to clear
B	yeah
A	shit the bed
B	I mean I've I
A	that is disgusting
B	transfer money in and out of it all the time
A	just to keep you within
B	all these paid outs  all these paids outs account account account  account are all going to my other Natwest account
A	mm
B	that's the thing
A	mm
B	exactly how much I spend
A	mm
B	every month
A	mm
B	and they think that's okay?
A	what what is
B	A hundred and eighty quid
A	where what is that based on? Like what kind of agreement is that?
B	I don't know
A	Cos with HSBC if i go over my overdraft it's thirty-five pounds
B	yeah
A	which I think is extortionate
B	it used to be twenty-eight pounds
A	yeah
B	for one charge
A	are you gonna you're just gonna have to speak to them and say what the hell do you think you're doing? I mean really it doesn't seem like this account is doing you any favours
B	no
A	if you've already got another account that your salary's going in and out of
B	well yeah course I do
B	but when you're earning what I'm earning there's no way I'm paying off five hundred pound is there
A	yeah right
B	there's no way I'm paying off the extra four hundred full stop
A	well absolutely
B	yeah
B	well if you look at the account
B	not now but if you look at this
A	yeah
B	account before I started
A	that's what you're doing
B	the last job my salary used to get paid in here
A	oh I see
B	Cos the other one is interest free overdraft
A	right
B	I stopped it getting paid in here is because they fucked me over doing the exact same thing about six months ago
A	right
B	so when I moved the new job I stopped it cos they'd fucked me over
A	mm
B	and the bank fraud and
A	mm
B	all that shit
A	mm
B	so I stopped money going in here
A	tut
B	so I've never had to worry about this
A	God I'd forgotten about all that
B	yeah
A	when you couldn't access any money for like two months
B	I didn't have a bank card before that
A	yeah
B	for eight months
A	Jesus
B	well I can't move can I cos I  I owe I  owe them two grand
A	yeah but you'll just move the debt
B	can't move two grand
A	I don't know
B	there's nobody gonna give me an overdraft now
A	I mean you've not really got any credit rating
B	what? What did you just say?
A	you haven't got any credit rating have you
B	oh yes
A	yep
B	horrendous
A	you have no good credit
B	yes
A	um
B	my dad got  my dad got  a debt collector letter apparently
A	yeah
B	waiting for him to forward that
A	I've got one of those
B	mm
A	um
B	that's what I reckon
A	yeah
B	mine's an HSBC credit card
A	brilliant
B	mm
A	I suppose er what you need to do is go into the branch and just say what the fuck do you think you're
B	yeah
A	and just say do you think that
B	well I've spoken to this guy before
A	mm
B	it's been the past three years with one bank manager
A	mm
B	and his name's
A	clearly
B	and he's the escalator to his boss to the regional boss and to
A	yeah
B	their head office in
A	Jesus
B	for this account
A	so they're very aware of this and yet they think that this is acceptable
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I can't every three months be dealing with some type of shite
A	yeah
B	and the best one the kicker is I can't even get to see this guy cos he doesn't work weekends
A	awesome
B	yeah
A	the shifts that you work then yeah?
B	yeah
A	Good
B	mm
A	that's really helpful
B	so
A	because that can't be legal
A	anything that says what your interest arrangement is
B	God no
A	is there er have you got internet banking?
B	check it out Liz I've had this since I was sixteen
A	is there um yeah er I'm you know I'm mental
B	yeah
A	but er have you got internet banking?
B	mm
A	yeah? Maybe there's maybe I've never looked but maybe in there because I've gone paperless so I never get er paper
B	yeah
A	bank statements
B	account
B	maybe
A	access what your interest arrangement is on there
B	yeah
A	and I would try and find that out before you go in tomorrow
B	oh no I'm not going in
A	okay
B	Cos there's no way I'm dealing with somebody now for them to say you've not done it
A	whatever it is that you do I would make sure that you know what your arrangement is
B	mm
A	say it to their face
B	well they should have it as well shouldn't they when I signed it
A	oh they'll have it on record
B	initially
A	but it just seems that when you're writing the letter you can say this is illegal
B	yeah
A	and I will be taking it up to my ombudsman
B	mm
A	I'm escalating this to this person because
B	A hundred and eighty pound for
A	I can't
B	yeah
A	that's it
B	mine was
A	if you're in by two pounds
B	the worst one I've ever heard is Halifax will charge you a pound a day
A	yeah the but the thing is the bank will charge you an instant fee for for breaking terms of your
B	the terms
A	in of your overdraft
B	because the amount I'm over my overdraft limit is increasing
A	yeah so that's not but that's not the interest
B	no but the percentage
A	yeah but that can er that can never be the percentage
B	I think they're working this out
A	though can it
B	yeah
A	unless er unless it's er
B	five hundred
A	yeah
B	I'm over my overdraft limit by a hundred and thirty-eight pounds
A	the interest
B	a percentage of how much you're over
A	well that would be the explanation
B	isn't it
A	that's like fifty percent
B	yeah
A	that's not three percent or six percent
B	no
A	or whatever is the standard
B	that's like nutty on the TV loan
A	yeah
B	payday thing
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and my interest on there
A	you need to work that out
B	on the account usually is like really low
A	we need to work it out
B	and the kicker is that if they  if they  look back on my accounts
A	yeah
B	is if they took out every single error that's been theirs I've always been really good with it
A	it's weird
B	always paid it back over the month
A	yeah yeah
B	and any time it's ever gone over or there's been a problem it's been their error
A	mm
B	I mean this isn't their error
A	I think it is their error
B	mm
A	the guy saying you've got another charge due
B	I have no idea
A	I mean what you need to go and do is go back and trace you know the last sort of six months
B	mm
A	and tot it up
A	as much as possible to find what your um what your terms are
B	I'm gonna take this dress off
A	that's gonna be a shit game
B	isn't it
A	print it all off at work
B	that's a
A	and er
B	try that
A	oh okay
B	so
A	on my one you can go back a certain amount and then you have to ask them
B	that's what I've gotta do
A	oh huh
B	cack
A	that's really cack
B	completely forgot where it was despite the fact I live just off it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and made
B	via our house
B	I forgot that
A	yeah
B	we drove from
B	yeah
A	you're a massive knob
A	mm
B	I I actually did that
A	like when you drove to Sussex when you were looking for the
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	exactly like that time
A	yeah
A	I mean really
B	I don't I really don't know

B	tut
A	you went running
A	oh no you were gonna go yesterday but you went swimming
B	yeah
A	tut
B	my face seems to be a little bit red
A	it might just be because it's really warm and tropical in here
B	or because I burnt it on the sunbed
A	is there gonna be no more sunbed?
B	tut
A	but you might die
B	but I might go fluorescent red
A	Oompa Loompa
B	that'll be me
A	mm
B	yes
A	so the dentist is gonna cost him thousands of pounds
B	yeah
A	that's a bit of a killer
B	yeah
A	tut
A	well he was like oh if I get a crime number then I won't have to pay cos I'll get compensation
A	yeah
B	no
A	it's it's not like if he'd been hit by a bus for example
A	I think you might have a bit more sympathy
B	I certainly would
A	look at your tidy room
A	finished
B	um
A	your bed's looking really good
B	that bowl right next to my pillow's my favourite part
B	since I came home
A	oh right
B	not that bad
A	right
B	for when it's hospital time
A	alright
B	just so you know
A	mm
B	actually if you want dental work the cheapest place to do it is Turkey
A	oh okay
B	the cost is in England two grand for an implant
A	sweet
B	yeah
A	so even with the flight you're laughing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	for you going
A	mm
B	and having it done there and then
A	yeah
B	they just book like five hours off in the morning and just do it all
B	so huh it's
A	yeah my uncle did that
B	mm
A	of money towards it
B	yeah
A	veneers
B	I was gonna get veneers for my twenty-first
A	mm
B	and then we found out that they don't last
A	no
B	they only last like ten years max don't they
A	I dunno if it's veneers
B	yeah
A	so veneers is probably the wrong word
B	yeah
A	implants I suppose
B	that that's a cap
A	this this is like new teeth
B	if you file it down
A	mm
B	to a point
A	mm
B	and then they put porcelain tooth on
A	mm
B	that's a cap
A	what's a veneer then?
B	A veneer is when they they file it they file most most of your teeth are still there and they put a cover on it I think
A	oh right
B	A cap is the bottom half of your tooth
A	yeah
B	Cos the point's still there
A	mm
B	but it's drilled into your jaw
A	yeah
B	implants
A	they drilled into his jaw
B	so they would've he would've had to have all his teeth removed
A	uh
B	not filed down
A	mm
B	maybe
A	that they drilled it down to pegs
B	oh they
A	but there there was drilling into his  into his  skull
B	yeah
A	mm
B	capped some and
A	mm
A	Cos Clare's step-mum had that recently
B	yeah
A	and it was horrendously painful
B	yeah
A	that's gonna happen?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean er I will
A	mm
B	tut
A	lordy
B	hence my shit teeth now that decide to break very easily
A	tut
B	well then he said  he said  oh so it's gonna cost me a load of money
A	mm
B	I said
B	he was like yeah
A	like old people have
B	so he's actually considering
A	having er something that you take in and out
B	having a plate
A	mm
B	is it just me that can't understand how anybody anybody?
A	Cos I'd seen my nan's dentures
B	fall out
A	right well fucking A because then I can just get
A	replacement teeth
B	er great
A	awesome
B	yes
A	and you actually can't eat anything
B	yeah
A	no matter how good they say they are now
A	mm
B	two grand for an implant? Or a denture?
A	mm
B	er two grand thanks
A	yeah
B	I think
A	absolutely
B	no
A	you take in and out or you just have an implant
B	there is no case
A	so er the police will not give you a crime number
B	no
A	because there was no crime
B	definitely not
A	they came round and said you're a knob
B	yep
A	you told the paramedics that you fell
B	you're a twat
A	mm
B	and short
A	I think he's made this into a bigger deal for us to feel sorry for him
B	how? Er that can't have happened if he he could speak to the ambulance people
A	mm
B	that can't have actually happened
A	they were just playing silly silly buggers
A	er stealing around stealing bloody licence plate numbers and leaving them in here
B	yes
A	having a laugh aren't they
B	yeah
A	thought it was really funny cos why would they've put it in here? Like ha ha this'll be really really funny
B	yeah
A	like it's not
B	no
A	if they really thought that they'd grabbed it off a car then hit him they'd have kept it and given it to the police or something
B	yeah
A	you know
B	no
B	mm
A	mm
B	sick and wrong
A	tut
A	me?
B	er
A	probs
B	no
A	huh
