B	where the Aldi is
A	where Aldi is
B	oh
A	um
B	I can do that
A	so
B	my feet are cold
A	that's nice and easy
B	yah
A	so that's a bit of a winner
B	oh shite
A	oh yeah
B	came back to work and left again
A	shit
B	with the death
A	huh
B	yeah
A	that's not great
B	mm
A	oh really? After you said you know take some time to consider what it is that you want
B	um
A	mm
B	that was it
A	mm
B	he was like oh thanks hon
A	mm
B	um
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	I just said oh you know
A	mhm
B	not too much to do
A	mm
B	which was fine
A	he's not making it easy is he
B	no
A	did you feel quite upset this morning?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I said I mean I'm the last thing I said to her so I told him is well you know whether if you can if you
A	mm
B	that's it
A	mm
B	game over
A	mm
B	and that's that
A	yeah
B	but if you er if you do wanna be a friend then you have to be a
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	is a pile of shit
A	yeah
B	I said because otherwise I wouldn't have been with you for three years
A	yeah
B	you never let me down
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't want you as a friend if I thought that you were gonna be a crap one
A	yeah
B	just because you don't keep in touch with
A	yeah
B	doesn't make you a crap friend
A	I mean it's like we said yesterday
B	yeah
A	it's not like you're eighty and you can't change and you think oh I really like I regret
B	yeah
A	treating my friends in that way
B	do you know the worst thing is? When we were together before er before we decided to separate
A	mm
B	um
A	yeah
B	and I
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	I took him back up to
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	she you know she'll not think to do that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I was like part of that reason is you've never been out of your comfort zone
A	yeah
B	he'd like he had the same part-time job growing up
A	mm
B	when he went to uni he kept it cos he went to uni in the same place he grew up in
A	mm
B	he never changed high school
A	mm
B	so the same types of people
A	mm
B	so he did leave his friends then
A	yeah
B	went to HND but then obviously you don't then leave college and go to uni
A	mm
B	until he moved down here with me he'd never his choices consciously or not had never put him in a position where he'd have to work on friendships
A	mm
B	there all the time and
A	mm
B	so when he moved away I said to him you know it's hard
A	yeah
B	why don't you go and see
A	mm
B	and not very often but
A	mm
B	but he said some really awful things Liz
A	to you?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I know what he's getting at when he's saying that if we did something if something went wrong
A	mm
B	I used to freak out
A	yeah
B	and I did  I did  Like
A	yeah
B	I don't know why
A	yeah
B	Cos
A	mm
B	because he didn't in hindsight I should've said this to him
A	yeah
B	that I I didn't feel I could  I could  rely on him
A	mm
B	if we were planning to do something
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	it's
A	Cos you sort of take that person for granted
B	yeah
A	treating them really badly without even realizing it
B	yeah
A	because it takes for you to either wake up one day and think shit you know I've I've been a total cow and I'll try and be better
B	mm
A	or it takes for them to say do you know what? You've pushed me so far I don't think I can take it anymore
B	and he never said that
A	and he never did it
B	no
A	it's you know it's it's circumstantial at this point because you broke up and that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	how bad
A	yeah
B	you feel
A	yeah
B	and I know you're not like that
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh honey
A	come on
B	and plus
A	yeah
B	got on the scales
A	huh
B	four pounds down
A	shit
B	and I was terrified of getting on them after sitting
A	really?
B	in bed and eating Camembert and Maltesers all week being ill
A	yeah
B	but how did that possibly work?
A	yeah I know
B	mm
A	like er you know day to day they look different
B	you just don't
A	unless like um it's probably just the heels
B	don't notice it
A	to be fair
B	yes
A	by like five
B	yeah
A	oh sweet
A	yeah
B	and I could see he was starting to panic and he didn't want to say anything
A	oh
B	um
A	mm
B	honestly
A	mm
B	Cos he was just getting himself worked up more than anything
A	yeah
B	it's just daft
A	yeah
B	um
A	mm
B	and just held it there
A	that's I mean it's really unfair of him
B	yeah
A	I think
B	he I think er he he must know
A	it's out of order
B	he was hugging me and picking me up and
A	mm
B	mm
A	and you don't want him to stop doing it because it's very lovely
B	mm
A	mm
B	push him down the stairs at the
A	what a knobber
B	I'm very excited at pizza time
A	I know
B	I haven't eaten today
A	oh
B	wait till you hear what I've eaten today
A	I bet you've not eaten anything have you?
B	I've eaten some good shit today
A	have you? You better have
B	my um my colleague
A	right
B	oh
A	chocolate? Wow
B	that was really nice
A	that sounds delish
B	and then Eve went to a revenue meeting
A	yeah
B	and ordered a piece of rocky road from the bar
A	yum
B	then felt bad for eating it all so brought half back in to auction between Simon and I
B	um so then for lunch I had half a rocky road
A	mm
B	and then huh what have I got a toilet roll in here for? What have I been doing with that?
B	who knows
A	wow
B	in in fact
A	cigarette for lunch
B	so
A	all the  all the  good stuff then
B	I just had all the good stuff
A	nice
B	yep
A	for a pizza the size of your head
B	I think
A	well done

B	I thought I'd just prepare myself
A	yep
B	preparing for pizza time
A	oh
B	lots of goodness
A	the goodness
B	what?
A	I know
B	are you now?
A	well because I
B	mm
A	and
B	it's worth it
A	Don't do it often
B	uh
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that's a winner
A	that's pretty nice isn't it?
B	I always add loads of them
A	yeah
B	Cos I have so many toppings
A	yeah
B	couldn't you replace it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	er
B	maybe
A	er chicken feast
B	maybe
A	mm
B	do we have wine in? Or do we need to go to Co-op?
A	oh this is really good
B	oh yeah
A	Cos did you start on the second bottle?
B	no
A	no
B	yeah
B	can tick it
A	oh
B	winner
A	yeah but it's er we opened it about approximately a month ago
B	well er
A	what we want really
B	I think it probably just needed to mature
A	I think it definitely did
B	you can't leave something cooped up suffocating
A	no
B	it might die
A	chicken
B	have you chosen large?
A	yeah
A	stand down
B	maybe that's how much  how much  was it before?
A	that's how much it is with all the normal three things
B	ah
A	I think
B	so you've got one more thing to choose that's within the fourteen ninety-nine
A	oh
B	see I always take off mozzarella cheese and add half-fat cheese
A	interesting
B	yeah
A	well I mean if it means that your brain is happier
B	mm
A	then that's not a problem
B	well it's like one of those things ain't it? You go to McDonald's and have a diet coke and there's no point in drinking diet coke
A	two Big Macs
B	yeah
A	with large fries
B	so have you
A	this is on the Margherita
B	put it together and then see

A	you know make sure there's no coming back from it
A	right
A	oh

A	nice
A	that'd be nice
B	I know
A	oo salami
B	I don't know what I want
A	you can have meatball pizza
B	like I think
A	that's a bit mental
B	I might want garlic butter
A	yep
B	and
A	that is cheeky that they make you pay for that
B	yeah
A	where do they put that? Do they put it on the base?
B	dunno
A	and then put the tomato on?
B	I kinda want oh you can choose your sauce

B	yeah
A	God
B	um
A	mm
B	and how different shapes moved across the floor
A	mm
B	bags swirling and
B	there was one where like a stand and lamp-shade like that rolling and as it rolled something blew through it rubbish
A	oh God
B	and it went on for ages and ages
A	mm
B	and then I got sucked in
B	Cos then you're watching the rubbish and trying to your brain was trying to think of which way it would move
A	mm
B	I was like this sat on the floor
A	wow
B	just watched it for ages
A	quite mesmerizing
B	like watching an aquarium
A	mm
B	it was a bit like that
A	mm
B	it was well weird
A	could spend the whole of your day there couldn't you?
B	yeah
A	excuse me
B	I did particularly like the book where it started replacing any word in signs with fuck
A	that's quite funny
B	fuck portraits
A	fuck daisies
B	really funny
A	bloody hell
A	yep
A	I really am er worried about who's gonna be transcribing the conversations
B	oh
A	and my when I loaded some of the last recordings into Dropbox it said
B	yeah
A	his name's
A	ridiculous things
A	I just yeah
A	it wasn't me
A	she does it all the time
A	Charlie stop throwing your voice
B	stop practising throwing your voice
A	um
B	er
A	I've never had this one
B	mm
A	pretty lovely
B	I've had that one before
A	I've never had this one
B	I haven't had that one
A	that's nice
B	yeah
A	I don't think I've had that
B	I've had all of them apart from the top one I think
A	oh okay
B	just go for it
A	well should we go with that one as we've not had it before
B	well I love polar bears
A	that's your favourite flavour of ice cream
B	that's polar bear
A	er minced polar bear
A	pour moi
B	I stood next to a polar bear
A	no you didn't
B	I went to the Natural History Museum
A	oh right
B	not a real live one
A	a living one
B	yeah
A	I love the Natural History Museum
B	yeah
A	they're fucking huge
B	the dinosaurs before
A	yeah
B	and this makes me sound really awful
A	oh God
B	not as awful as the Africa thing
A	that was pretty bad
B	that was pretty bad
A	does anyone think that?
B	well
A	apart from you
B	I did
B	like I didn't realize we
A	right
B	I thought we had you know some bones
A	yeah
B	no
A	so you've never been to the?
B	and I didn't know there were so many different types as well
A	yeah
B	you know you see like the one with the long thing that eats the trees and
A	mm
B	the triceratops and
B	but but there were just so many different ones
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	mm
A	Cos all the dinosaurs would've eaten them
B	mm
A	we had loads of school trips to the Science Museum and the
B	huh
A	history Museum and
B	I would've loved that
A	it's pretty exciting
B	mm
A	Cos she'd lived in
B	yeah
A	and it's just too far
B	no
A	in a day
B	yeah
A	ever
A	yeah
B	but just to be around that environment all the time
A	er er yeah
B	oh okay
A	that was the country
B	yeah
A	we didn't live in the country
B	yeah
A	absolutely obsessed
B	oh yeah
A	who'd bought it
B	huh
A	I would've made the same decision
A	you would have a house that's worth nearly a million pounds
B	huh
A	not be living in an old
B	jeebus
A	granny flat in
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but pretend it doesn't
A	mhm
B	for four years
B	there I won't be paying out rent
A	mm
B	so I could really
A	mm
B	hypothetically if I worked at it I reckon I could
A	but you're gonna be on a  on a  boat most of the time aren't you?
B	and then I get an extra twenty pound a day for being on the boat
A	yeah
B	on top of the thirty grand
A	so that's pretty sweet
B	so fifteen grand to save
A	mm
B	a year
A	yeah
B	that's still forty grand
A	with yourself
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so I thought oo
A	mm
B	and when I leave the navy and then they give me money for
A	mm
B	they give me they help you with your mortgage
A	wow
B	I
A	that's amazing
B	like okay so I wouldn't be able to get in central
A	if you wanted to  If you wanted to  I mean the best er particularly because when you come back you you know you'll want to move out and you'll be I mean in in theory you won't have a fella or something because you'll have been on living on a boat
B	mm
A	shack up with one of your crew
B	mm
A	er
B	yeah
A	you know outside in one of the suburbs
B	yeah
A	and that's it's pretty exciting place to live
B	mm
A	for a couple of years
B	yeah
A	and making the decision
B	yeah
A	because it is mental
B	that'd be a bit extreme
A	and I mean it I like I mean I love visiting
B	oh I don't
A	I really
B	I was  I was  really upset when I had to get on the train home
A	really?
B	yeah
A	well
B	I always am
A	well that's what
A	she misses
B	like
A	dirty
B	well yeah
A	it's dirty
B	mm
A	loads of people there and all the time and when you go to bars and stuff it's great because there's a real mix of people which you don't get in
B	yeah
A	when you're visiting
B	oh
A	oo I don't know I you know not that I get nervous cos I'm I can I I
B	yeah but it's an excitement isn't it
A	can navigate myself around
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	lose that sheen
B	yeah
A	and I don't want it to
B	uh
B	God

A	italian
B	not a lot though
A	I mean singing is very different to speaking
B	mm
A	er you know

A	mm
B	to use the  to use the
A	mm
B	and I got something else to go to the bathroom with

B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I was like well I didn't know Liz was awake actually
A	mm
B	but either way there's no reason to be inconsiderate like that
A	mm
B	open the door in the first place
A	mm
B	unless you require to go through it
A	yeah
B	um
A	God
B	well you're not being considerate
A	mm
B	okay
A	mm
B	do you want me to put a tally up?
A	mm
B	Cos you're at three a week
A	mm
B	I said and
A	yeah
B	er yeah
B	and I said that to her
A	mm
B	or when you stamp down the stairs at nine o'clock in the morning when I've not gotta be up
A	mm
B	and she said what do you want me to do? Fly? And I said
A	Christ
B	and you telling me you're not childish? And I said er do you have a problem with your feet?
B	are you  Are you  physically disabled? Or are you just mentally
B	disabled? Cos right now we've got a bit of a problem
A	oh God
B	and that's when I started getting angry
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	either you're ten ton
B	or you're just being inconsiderate
B	like they were just being stupid
A	petty isn't it? Yeah
B	and that's why it got me angry
A	mm
B	or just talking
A	really?
B	honestly she was being horrendous
A	God
A	mm
B	high horse um and she won't listen
A	mm
B	which she you know I'm I'm kinda used to getting that from her now
A	it's mad isn't it?
B	I would've swung for her
A	what the hell's the matter with the girl?
B	dunno
A	no one but no one's been sort of antagonistic towards her
B	well then she said well you didn't ask me to close the door
A	mm
B	and I said why should I ask you to close a door?
A	mm
B	usually people just out of courtesy are just
A	mm
B	polite enough to close the door
A	mm
B	and I said and you'd think perhaps after the first morning you woke me up and I told you thanks for waking me up
A	mm
B	you would've then closed the door
A	mm
B	kind towards you when you're purposefully not being towards me? I said look at your attitude now
A	mm
B	so
A	it's weird isn't it? It's quite strange to come in and be so bolshy
B	I think it's only cos she's got
A	mm
B	so I went to the loo
A	it's weird isn't it?
B	she tried to avoid looking at me
A	mm
B	so I think it's just because she'd got
A	tut
B	mm
A	oh huh
B	complete madness

A	mm

B	yeah
A	so basically um
B	my
A	be a cowbag
B	be a cowbag
A	mm
B	got a flight to that place
B	yeah

B	mm
A	tut
B	bMI Baby
A	see we are on BMI Baby
B	mm
A	so
B	to?
A	flybe
B	okay
A	they also fly from somewhere
B	oh
A	so
B	she went from Stansted
A	not to
B	oh
A	which is cheaper
B	Cos I was thinking if it's a big difference we could hire a car
A	well yeah
A	right
B	A logistical craziness
A	yeah
A	in fact can you come to
B	you'd really help me out if you could change your entire wedding around me
A	yeah
B	and stop being so selfish
A	stop being so fucking selfish
B	is the  Is the  wedding at The Old Inn?
A	no
B	mm
A	you see thirteen minutes
B	mm
A	although actually it's the other way
B	yep
A	and then apparently
B	right
A	quite annoying
B	mm
A	then you get a train
B	or if not they could keep our bags anyway couldn't they
A	yeah
B	yep
A	they're gonna have nice toilets
B	and where's the other
A	um
B	that's got an airport next to it
A	so that's that's the city
B	mm
A	because that's the city
B	got it
A	and that's the hotel
B	extortionate
A	extortionate
B	and is everybody staying at the same hotel?
A	yeah
B	right
A	we could
B	we could actually get another hotel with the chain
A	yeah
B	between the two
A	yeah
B	and it would cost us like twenty quid each
A	oo
B	for a Holiday Inn
A	now that would be an option wouldn't it?
B	mm
A	mm
B	if there's a hotel half-way between with the last place we've got to get to her
A	mm
B	and the International Airport
A	mm
B	if there's a hotel between the two
A	mm
B	then it would work out cheaper for us to do it that way
A	yeah
B	if that's a real life option
A	okay
B	right
A	so worst case scenario we can just cab it
B	yeah
A	if we're gonna do that way
B	yeah
A	because by the time we get ready I don't really wanna miss the wedding
B	yeah
A	so
B	yep
A	huh
B	huh
A	right

B	as released by the golden bangers
A	oh
B	oh
A	Sarah and I have got our own
B	oh
A	Cos we often wore purple on the same day
A	so must've been on the same wavelength that morning
B	everyone
A	mm
B	Cos a lot of the managers at at work cos well actually just the ones in my office
A	mm
B	are buggers and don't wear the um uniform
A	oh
B	they wear their own suit
A	huh
B	Cos like we spend half the time in the office anyway so
A	yeah
B	they'd all chosen pink shirts
A	how funny
A	huh
B	and then er
B	why did I just choose juice for then when I've got wine down here?
A	that could've gone wrong
B	huh gone wrong in the head
A	your base looks alright actually
B	mm
A	it looks like the normal one
B	maybe it is
A	mm
B	sausages
A	mm
B	yum
A	mm
B	depending on locacines
A	mm
B	we could cos given that map depend cos you kind we're kinda going up and down
A	mm
B	if the the wedding's just below the city
A	mm
B	if we fly into that side a bit
A	yeah
B	the
A	the reception back to the hotel
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	probably quite a
A	or sleeping in the
B	pivotal factor
A	hotel toilets
A	which is always an option
B	yep
A	mm
B	I mean I don't own a sleeping bag but
A	mm mm
B	I'm figuring by the time I've weddinged it up I won't care
A	yeah
B	yep
A	mm
B	mm
A	we could sleep on that
A	airport party bus
B	that would be pretty good
A	mm
A	or we just
B	mhm
A	didn't think of the viable option
B	mm
A	mm
B	yes
B	that's quite exciting
A	mm
B	do you know what I always think? And I thought this at Michelle's wedding when I saw that
A	mm
B	and all the drink is your wedding night really gonna be a night to remember?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	there's
B	no
A	you've probably been up since five A M
B	yeah
A	you've been drinking all day
B	from champagne breakfast
A	mhm
B	you're probably gonna die
A	mm
B	you're probably gonna get back to the hotel and think right you know I really love you and all that but
B	and this is my sexy underwear
B	I'm gonna sleep in it now
A	yeah
B	you may look
A	and try not  try not  to vom
B	yeah I'm gonna try  I'm gonna try  not to vom on it
B	if you're lucky and I don't vom you might see it tomorrow
B	otherwise this was it
B	nice knowing you
A	looking forward to the next forty years
A	start of things to come though isn't it
B	oh that
A	so you might as well
A	mm
A	just say no
A	wear it on the party bus
B	oh
B	right
A	when they have to be I was like you you don't have to be traditional
B	mm
A	and to have the big pompous circumstances
B	mm
A	like the fact that they've banned children
B	I'd have totally banned children
A	mm
B	I think everyone in the country should
A	just er for everything
B	yeah generally
A	well yeah
B	I mean if you're having kids lovely
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh yum
B	Liz the pizza was such a good call
A	mm
A	we just squash that on
B	yep
A	it's quite
B	array of everything
A	mm
B	there's not a lot of spinach on here
A	no
B	is there really? Like token spinach
A	mm
B	hm hm hm
A	starving
B	hm hm hm
A	mm
B	mm
A	and she basically gave me all her projects to look after
B	oh
A	while she's away
B	in preparation for the big move
A	she was like you know I'm only an e-mail away
B	mm
A	I mean our clocks go forward
B	that's not fair
A	that's not fair
B	mm
A	and the old battle-axe in my office
B	yes
A	mhm hm
B	serves you right for being a battle-axe
A	mhm
B	I think you'll find
A	mhm
B	all on you
A	can't stand her
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	Good
A	it just looks really exciting
B	Cos half the Americans are stupid
A	mm
B	mm
A	raving loonies
B	when I um when I was in Perugia because there's an international it's like a a university for foreigners
A	mm
B	there
A	mm
B	they go to the uni for foreigners
A	right
B	which I mean you still get a qualification out of it
A	mm
B	it was just crap
A	God
B	mm
A	Good
B	um
A	yeah
B	so I got
A	mm
B	really that's quite bad
A	mm
B	really
A	degree level
B	degree level
A	yeah
B	oh is it?
B	um
A	wow
B	bad my Italian was
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	Don't know how
A	mhm
B	but I suppose I was only there for three weeks so
A	mhm
B	mm
A	what?
B	mm
A	really?
B	and like she said to them what do you mean why?
A	mm
B	that's a really great like opportunity
A	mhm
B	and they were like but why do you want to go? Even her family were like what are you talking about?
B	why are you going there? And I was like
A	mm
B	I don't know anybody else that owns a passport
A	hm
B	she doesn't know one other person that owns a passport
A	in her generation? That's mad
B	everyone
A	mm
B	anybody
A	mm
B	she doesn't know one other person
A	mm
B	yeah
A	no
B	mm
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	they don't do it
A	yeah
B	you know some other state maybe
A	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	like you wouldn't think of starting up a relationship with someone in Scotland would you
A	no no
B	mm
A	but everything's on a massive scale there isn't it
B	yeah
A	I just find it weird that the this generation there's not the same there's not a get up and go
B	mm
A	you know the world's a much smaller place these days
B	mm
A	that they don't think it
B	Cos then I started to think about it
A	mm
B	you can get there for under two hundred quid
A	mm
B	you could probably even get to China for if you booked it right my a friend of mine found one to Singapore
A	mhm
B	but if you're in America
A	mm
B	I wouldn't  I wouldn't  really think to do that
A	mm
B	but that's a big difference
A	mm
B	and er maybe their initial flights to leave America start at the five fifty mark
A	if it was yeah
B	I mean I've never looked into it so I don't know but perhaps that's it
A	mm
B	mm
A	and I always think in my head cos she was saying he'll come over for Easter for a week and I was thinking oh well you just fly round the the Pacific
B	mhm
A	to get to America
B	what?
A	it was mental
B	why?
A	and she said the other one
B	why?
A	I don't know
B	does someone want
A	I mean I don't know if it's just that they can't it's just too far a distance to fly without stopping
B	oh
A	I dunno
B	oh maybe
A	mm
B	ah do you know we can fricking put a
A	mm
B	I bet they can you know
A	yeah yeah
B	oh yeah
A	not gonna have a lot of petrol
A	um
B	oh
A	Australia and New Zealand you for a month at least
B	mm
A	because the jet lag's a bitch
B	unless you're
A	and consider it travelling
B	yep yep yep
B	which of course it is
A	well for
B	in
A	yeah
A	go down the high street
B	but it is in his defence
B	it is the longest high street in the UK
A	sorry I'd forgotten that
B	yep
A	excellent piece of trivia
B	favourite piece of trivia
A	mm
B	I think you'll find
A	mm
B	yeah so
A	that's pretty intense by anyone's expectations that's pretty intense
B	what?
A	and they won't accept tips but you could take them out for lunch or you could buy them coffee
B	mm
A	and she's gonna ask to do the route to work
B	oh
A	somebody else
B	how come? Is she scared of it?
A	she's a bit scared
B	oh

A	and called him after fifteen years
B	huh
A	they were given champagne
B	oh

B	we all know the Queen
A	yeah
B	Liz
B	our
A	we're like that
A	it's really funny
B	I've told you about my dad and tea with the Queen didn't I

A	mm
B	except for the one you have when you were a kid and
A	oh yeah
B	you put your pennies in
A	yeah
B	there's probably about four hundred quid in it
A	I got
B	if you're lucky
A	really angry with my mum when she took my pennies away
A	I was like
B	oh
A	it was the one with the tubes
B	yeah

B	I can't see it
B	I was awful

A	no
B	bit of crack
A	you're from the
A	I hear that's what they do there
B	oh yeah that's not a massive
A	no
B	at all
A	that's not what we'd do in the
B	no
A	no
B	er heroin in the
A	heroin and babies when we're thirteen
A	mm
B	is the way forward
A	mm
B	but um yeah so I called my mum
A	so where were you living at this point?
B	um
A	this is when you've moved out? It was when you were living at your friend's house?
B	no
A	oh right
B	er I didn't move out till probably about eight months later
A	mm
B	um
B	well done
A	well done I'm so proud?
B	no
A	huh
B	seriously
A	fuck me
B	why wasn't that an A star?
A	one of her biggest issues
B	I said what do you mean why wasn't that an A star?
A	yeah
B	I just put the phone down on her
A	Good
B	I was like great
B	goodbye
A	on your failing at life
A	shit man
B	yeah
A	God
B	and I thought she was a bit sick
A	mm
B	and she said
A	mm
B	I was like that's a lie
A	mm
B	and then when I got my A-levels
A	mm
B	they had a massive stand up row with me
A	mhm
B	has considered me dead
A	you haven't lived with
A	God
B	at all
A	mm
B	and had relayed information
A	nice
B	and left the country without even telling me
A	fuck
B	yeah
A	mm
B	er to basically lay into me about how much of a failure I was
A	charming
B	and I mean at the time you know you're only what? Eighteen? You kind of
A	yeah
A	been able to actually do some work? Like living in her own home
A	possibly
B	yeah apparently not
A	mm
B	you might think you are but you know really you're not quite there yet
A	not like emotionally
B	then I was like oh God that really is I have done bad
A	mm
B	I went to uni
A	nice
B	nice
A	so had you gone through clearing?
A	mm
B	and how ridiculous is this? The entry requirements were er straight Bs
A	mm
B	the entry requirements to do French and Spanish were straight Cs
A	mm
B	so I called up
A	mm
B	um and they said no that's fine
A	nice
B	so I was like winner
A	mm
B	got there was there for three weeks and changed my course
A	yeah
B	er it turns out now if you would like to do three languages at any university in the country you need four As
A	shit man
A	that's really bad
B	yeah
A	that'll be really interesting
B	yeah
A	that'll do
B	of course
A	got in on that
B	mm
A	there was no way I would've got in on that
B	no
A	so
B	it doesn't make sense does it
A	winner
B	oh yeah
A	gotta have three As
B	yeah
A	but they're I mean they're so
B	yeah
A	it's ridiculous
B	Cos I know when I when
A	mhm
B	completely ridiculous
A	nice
B	Cos my mum and dad's
A	oh yeah
B	a dick
A	you did tell me that
B	um
A	wow
B	so it beat
A	mm
B	I
A	mm
B	um and I saw there saw
A	fine
B	didn't have to get a bus to different lessons
A	fine
B	so
A	well that's a good enough reason
B	yeah
A	fuck me
B	and it wasn't until I came back from living abroad for my twenty-first
A	yeah
B	that my mum told me how proud she was of me
A	so even though she's giving you er paying you a compliment she's putting your sister down
B	yep
A	so she can't do both
B	no
A	she can't compliment both of you
A	nice
B	er at either any one point
A	mm
B	one of us had to be in the doghouse
A	fucking hell
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	and that you know you'll go  you'll go  much further than
A	but
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	of course
A	mm
B	was getting praise the other one wasn't
A	mm
B	um
A	no she didn't?
B	yeah
A	er
B	on her kicking me out
A	er I mean er
B	yeah
A	you huh you can't actually fathom it can you
A	someone who gave birth to a child
B	I know
A	manages to justify
A	kicking her firstborn out the door
B	yeah
A	but it's okay
A	all my doing
B	yeah
A	so well done you
B	thanks mum
A	you should be thanking me
B	yeah
A	actually
B	yeah
A	what? Five years
B	yeah
A	and
B	and then about er maybe eight months later when they bought the bungalow
A	mm
B	um we went to see the bungalow
B	um that time you spent in
A	mm
B	coming out here
A	mm
B	and then I felt a bit bad
A	although but that she has to ask you
A	she can't empathize with the fact that a sixteen-year-old child who at their at that point thinks that they know it all but of course they don't
B	mm
A	actually needs their parents as
B	mm
A	it
B	off school in the social security office
A	yeah
B	trying to explain to them that I couldn't get them
B	you know er er a
A	who? What your social worker?
B	social worker's letter or a police letter to say that I was independent and needed their help
A	mm
B	without that you can't even get help from the state
A	mm
B	and I was like well no I can't cos I might be sixteen but I've been independent for quite a long time
A	mm
B	no I was seventeen
A	mhm
B	well yeah
A	while we're here
B	this is what I pay my taxes for
B	you know
A	I just wanted a chat
A	actually
B	yeah
A	a gas bag
B	just wanted to talk to someone
A	Cos you're really ineffectual
A	so the fact that she actually had to ask you
B	yeah
A	was that a bit difficult for you? She couldn't actually think shit that must've been really hard
A	it's gonna be really difficult for
B	yeah
A	not
B	yeah
A	you know and it's
B	or I did it for this
A	she was kicking you out
B	yeah
A	probably quite hard for her
B	yeah
A	being a mum
B	mm
A	must've been really difficult for her
B	cutting the cord
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	extra space in the house
A	well I mean what did she do with the room?
B	you know cos er her husband works away and it's just her and my sister in a four bed house
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	spending all that money must've been quite hard
A	yeah
B	that she's never worked a day for
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I thought she was gonna like you know get a bit upset and or perhaps
A	mm
B	say sorry
A	mm
B	I knew she's got a bit of a craziness
A	yeah
B	and so I was like oo
A	tumour
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I stood on my own two feet years before anyone else
A	mm
B	in hindsight
A	mm
B	so er er just don't worry about it
A	mm
B	you know
A	you can move on
B	you know
A	mhm
B	and you know we need each other
A	what did she say?
B	so I was like no mum no no it's okay
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	we don't need to worry about that now
A	concentrate on now
B	let's go
A	right
B	and I thought mm is this gonna be a cos I did badly
A	mm
B	no
B	and we were really close
A	mm
B	like she taught me all my numbers and everything
A	at the age of two?
B	at the age of two
A	well yeah but you're two
A	did you have counselling? Did she put you in for counselling? Right
B	so then
B	from then
A	God
B	yeah
A	so er ten years later
A	she thought that you were harbouring all of the that issue though
B	yeah
A	your nan died
B	my nan died
A	well I hate to break it to you
B	and I'm sure at two you know you you've got you know you've not got existential
A	well no
B	no
A	do you
B	no
A	I mean two year olds don't understand death
B	and that's about that
A	you don't really yeah you don't really
B	yeah
A	that's bollocks
B	have you ever heard anything as crackers in all your life?
A	not really
A	there's that's like a whole new well that's the most crazy thing I've ever heard
A	and then that's just superseded by the next story that you tell me
B	yeah
A	huh
B	shall I go and rescue the wine from the Spanish contingent?
A	oh
B	the plugger inerer
A	the plugger iner
B	I think I need another piece of this pizza
A	wine
B	vino
A	thanks love
A	mm
A	do you just feel sick?
B	yeah
A	you do
B	need more pizza
A	no you
B	and now I ate a slice and I feel quite badly for it
A	no
B	uh
A	come on
B	mm
A	why?
B	well
A	God
B	just because I liked the look of them
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	killer
B	and they squeak
B	they actually squeak
A	have you got mice living in your shoes?
B	I think I only had them on once
A	it's cos they're plastic isn't it?
B	mm
A	bloody Primark shoes
B	I mean it's fine for a night out
A	yeah
B	mm
A	squeaky McSqueakerson
B	have
B	so that was an issue
A	that's a bit of a shame isn't it?
B	mm
A	here you go
B	thanks dear
A	right
A	no
B	I don't have to give notice really
A	okay
B	with my bookage
A	with that
B	oo
A	it's protein
B	where did this fly come from?
A	the bottle
A	but in this you have the fly
B	said fly
A	it's got Jeff Goldblum's head
A	be very careful
B	gotta be careful about these things
A	you've
B	he died happy though
A	in in life
B	in said life
A	right
B	I liked those nails whatever they were that I just saw
A	er yeah
B	mm
A	I mean what I'm hoping is that what's his name? Lanky
B	lanky?
A	yeah
B	oh yes yes yes
A	what's his name?
B	mm
A	four people equals a party
B	she added me as a friend actually
A	you
B	it's not just her I haven't accepted
A	I was gonna say
A	I'll tell her not to feel offended
B	yeah
A	I like the way that you get
A	like we're some sort of
B	yes
A	married couple
B	yep
A	the  thing?
B	the well initially the  thing
A	mhm
B	that's also er you're a plus one for
A	thank you
B	and um the other thing with the not the chinchillas
A	what the hell are you talking about?
B	Iguanas
A	oh
B	yeah
A	oh
B	so you've been invited as a plus one from Jord and a plus one from work
A	oh amazing
B	I think between us I think we're gonna get a pretty good
B	deal out of this lot
A	we're
A	is just what's happening
B	Mac death
A	so I had my date with the chav on Sunday
B	oo
A	it was
B	it's not love
A	but I probably will see him again
B	obviously the two go hand in hand
A	naturally
A	ability to write screenplays
B	in the loop
A	what's going on how are you gonna
B	huh
A	but ff that's not dissimilar
B	I think that might've been done now
A	yeah
B	what?
A	yeah
B	rewind
A	er he's got three kids it turns out
A	mm
B	oh my God
B	she
A	it's like something out of
B	she sold her baby
A	yeah
B	I was gonna say Jezza but I preferred yours
A	uh
B	oh God
A	the thing is he's so even though this is  this is  the excellent thing
B	mm
A	so even though he
B	mm
A	procreates with someone who's fucking mental
B	mm
A	he decides to do it three times
A	because cos once was just the test
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh
A	no
B	space
A	so he's looking to move out
B	she sold her son for a Blackberry
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	in the evenings
B	yeah
A	absorbing information
B	huh
A	his son is thirteen
B	oo
A	and he didn't realize what was going on cos obviously he was with his reading with his son
A	the best episode
A	where they've got the doll and they like they're like he touched me here
B	here
A	he touched me here
B	bought them The Inbetweeners
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	talk about irresponsible
B	child abuse
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and she said er not booked but got an appointment at STA Travel
A	oh bless her
B	er do you know actually I meant to send her a message
A	yeah that's the Fabergé egg
B	yeah it's like worth a hundred grand
A	nice
B	yeah
A	that house is so cute
B	yeah
A	it's really nice
B	we ought to go on a Sunday afternoon though
A	we should
B	and do the hunt
A	yeah
B	um
A	yes
B	what was I going to say? Yeah
A	mm
B	like I was telling her about people wanting to move to Australia
A	oh yeah
B	there's one in London on the twenty-sixth
A	mm
B	she ought to do that really
A	yeah
B	to STA Travel I suppose
A	yeah
A	it's definitely the most important thing
B	right
A	so if I zoom out a fraction basically can we? That there is
B	so what so this to here is pretty good
A	that's pretty good
B	obviously
A	is
B	they're getting married at the hotel?
A	oh no I mean at the reception
B	oh right
A	sorry
B	got it
A	so International Airport
B	yep
A	hotel where the reception is
B	right
A	mm
B	we went from er airport
A	mhm
B	to Holiday Inn
A	yeah
B	to wedding
A	mhm
B	to reception
A	party bus
B	then where does then?
A	that that is a bit of a bitch
B	right
A	I mean er honestly
B	yep
A	because we could get a cab in or
B	or a train in
A	train just as easily
B	got it
A	into the city
B	yep
A	to the
B	for ten minutes
A	venue
B	party bus it up
A	party bus
B	and
A	stay there
B	yep
A	or come back
B	because we're already there
A	rather than there
B	so really the next question is how much are the flights to the to this place?
A	international
B	and where are the Holiday Inns situated?
A	I um
B	oo oo oo
A	what are you doing?
B	oh free free blanket
A	mm
B	because we might find that on those dates
B	maybe it's no difference
A	yeah
B	mm
A	we might as well just
B	mm
A	so what we could do is stay with Chrissy in Brixton on the Thursday night
B	mm
A	kip on her floor
B	huh
A	which is the first one
B	mm
A	um
B	just get through security
A	baggage
B	mm
A	and it's literally like parking er at the bottom of the road
B	yeah
A	you need
B	whereas if we did er fly to the the wrong airport
A	mm
B	and went from Stansted
A	mm
B	then
A	mm
B	and dinner and whatever
A	but coming back
B	coming back
A	good to know that you've got a lounge et cetera
B	to fall asleep in
A	mm
B	go now
B	Stansted
B	right
A	so we get in at ten past nine
B	right
A	and then say we came back the next day
B	yep
A	a decent time
B	oh
B	ah
A	which is a bit of a bitch because we'd get back to London the only flight left is this
B	mm
A	is this one
B	it's not horrendous
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you don't wanna be doing that
B	that's a bit of a killer
A	so realistically we'd have to do that one
B	yeah
A	by the time we get out across London on a Saturday evening
B	okay
A	and then that's a hundred
B	mm
A	that is right? Stansted to
B	right
A	okay
B	or in fact before we do that
A	mm
B	we'll go and we'll just put the employee thing on
A	the who now?
B	er I can't remember the website but it's basically the people who work for
A	right
B	for employee rate
A	oh nice
B	yeah
A	right
B	I can just get Leo to e-mail them and ask for a favour
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	but the likelihood of someone in the hotel knowing someone up there is quite likely
A	mm
B	and we just say I know you've not got this on but because they put it on if it's really definite that they'll have rooms
A	mm
B	that they wanna sell
A	mm
B	but in actual fact everyone every single hotel that's owned by IHG gets a certain amount of days per month they have to allocate to staff
A	mm
B	for usually anniversary days or something like that
A	oh that's good
B	so
A	mm
B	can you allocate a day
A	mm
B	for employer rate please?
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	it's all complete bollocks
A	mhm
B	you know
A	mm
B	but you know it's actually a lie
A	mhm
B	he'll stab me in the back at the first chance he gets
A	mhm
B	in fact if he doesn't tell
B	he would've probably told her before now
A	mhm
B	what day do we wanna check in?
A	the eighteenth of May
B	mhm
A	is there any word on the take-over?
B	er not as of yet
A	mm
B	well
A	oh
B	so it it would be looking that way
A	mm
B	so and I mean as much as they own Hiltons we're in a city we've already got a Hilton
A	yeah
B	so either you have to plough more money into our hotel to make it a five star
A	mm
B	or you've got competition from your own brand
A	mm
B	two brands same
A	mm
B	er you're gonna choose the cheaper option
A	oh yeah
B	so
A	well
B	I think if they did that they'd probably shoot themself in the foot
A	mm
B	this is not me  This is not me  Cos this is best available
B	employee rate I think
A	have you done it wrong?
B	yes
A	maybe if you take rate out of the um search
B	tut
A	is that not it? Employee reservations
B	no
A	hm
B	oh here we go
B	huh
A	mhm
B	but you know
A	we want International not City
B	okay
A	mhm
B	really shouldn't work in events you know
B	people call up and enquire and I have to ask them a million times what the hell date they asked for
B	if I've not got a pen
A	is it not like when you ask for directions? And you
B	yeah
A	mm
B	hotels
A	nice
B	yeah
B	so there's three hotels we can choose from
A	amazing
B	it'll load the map to give us where they are
A	so they don't have
B	um
A	yeah
A	mm
B	to share between two
A	oh
A	nice
B	oh it's pretty bog-standard
A	mm
B	there's no flat screen
A	mm
B	there's no concierge
A	mm
B	um
A	but they're better than a Travelodge Premier Inn?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's yeah it's it's probably like actually we stayed in a Premier Inn near Alton Towers
A	mm
B	and on-site restaurant
A	mm
B	like we're all trained
A	that's true
B	the same way so
A	yeah
B	the service is always there
A	better quality of service
B	although you know when we were in um London?
A	mm
B	their staff weren't half as good as our staff
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	um
A	yeah
B	I know you're gonna get into trouble for this cos I know
A	mm
B	it was through a friend of
A	hm
A	mm
B	maybe we should just put these in the map
A	er click on it
B	mm
A	we could just put the address in
B	er yes I didn't wanna kinda cause too much of a scene
A	mm
B	so I
A	er what is it that they didn't have your reservation?
B	they had it but they didn't know I'd already paid for it
A	mm
B	and they thought that I was paying extra for being able to go in the club lounge
A	mm
B	was I fuck? No
A	mm
B	so that's where this is
A	that's the distance from the hotel from the airport
A	that says city
B	Belfast International Airport
A	put your two fingers on the mouse mat and scroll down
B	oh
A	twenty miles is that?
B	from the airport
A	well that's fine
B	it's er
A	how long would that take to drive?
B	about half an hour
A	mm
B	maybe we if we go back we can get the actual go back oh is this this is not the page I was on
B	yeah
A	no
B	so we've got number one or number two to choose from
A	mm
B	number one's twenty-five pounds
A	mm
B	and this is one point one one miles from the city centre
A	mm
B	mm?
A	er I mean from the airport it doesn't really make much odds does it
B	mm mm
A	but from the hotel were we'd be at the reception
B	yeah
A	er two looks like it's nearer
B	two looks like it's nearer main roads doesn't it?
A	mm
B	let's can we kind of highlight this? Take it to the Google
A	mhm
B	oh no
B	I've got a link
A	no it's this one
B	you
A	mm
B	lost a sausage?
A	mm
B	let's
A	mm
B	zoom out
A	so that
B	yep
A	mm
B	I wonder how much it so we get the party bus to here
A	mhm
B	so we want to know how far it is to party bus don't we
A	that is the party bus
B	right
A	so
B	that one?
A	yeah
B	sixteen minutes
A	uh uh
B	Miles
A	mm
B	it's about half an hour from the airport
A	we could get a train
B	we could get a train
A	mm
B	or where's the
A	um
B	so this is basically the journey
A	mm
B	that we would be saving otherwise isn't it?
A	mm
B	Cos we'd just stay there
A	yeah
B	so it's twenty
A	mm
B	and we can also do train back to airport
A	yeah
B	as opposed to cab from here to airport
A	we definitely could on the Saturday couldn't we? Cos we'll have time
B	mm
A	my worry would be
B	on the way in
A	waiting for trains
B	yeah
A	I'd rather like suck it up
B	cab it  Cab it  to the
A	yeah
B	to the wedding
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and then get the train out
B	Cos then we won't have to rush
A	we won't need to worry
B	and if you you know you can spend time getting ready can't you
A	mm
B	yeah
A	Cos if if we're flying to Belfast International our flight gets in later
B	oh does it?
A	so if you click on easyJet
A	yeah
B	and what time's the wedding start?
A	twelve thirty
B	yeah
A	Cos by the time we get out of the airport it'll be ten
B	yep
A	get a cab
B	yep
A	mm
B	so we can request early check in
A	mhm
B	but really probably don't wanna check in cos er checking in at early check in will be twelve
A	okay
B	and we'd want to be left by then wouldn't we?
A	we wanna  We wanna  we need to have left by er quarter to twelve at the latest
B	yeah
A	mm
B	reception
A	mm
B	and leave it there
A	Will they be able to do that? Will they be to hold our luggage?
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and
B	yeah yeah
A	will they mind us checking in at at eleven o'clock or twelve o'clock P M?
B	in the morning? P M?
A	after we
B	no
A	get back
B	just tell them
A	okay
B	yep
A	okay
B	but they shouldn't really care
A	well that sounds fine
B	in under my buttocks?
A	Cos we've basically talked around in circles
B	thirty million years
A	jot this down
B	yep
A	um
B	yeah
A	it's only fifty quid or
B	yeah
A	mm
B	just so it's done
A	mm
B	Cos you never know
A	mm
B	yeah
A	okay
B	or
A	put it on my card
B	do you want to wait until I've e-mailed the hotel in the morning?
A	I think this is probably the better option
B	oh yeah
A	we should  we should  book into
B	yeah yeah
B	yep
A	even if we can't stay at the hotel
B	can't check in at proper times
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and I thought we could pay on my card
B	yep
A	or we can pay on your card and
B	or mine
A	I give you the cash
B	it doesn't make any difference
A	well that that's a brilliant idea
B	oh right
A	the thing is if you've got a bit of cash and I give you more cash then you might have cash for Trudy
B	we can do that
A	yeah? That
B	yep
A	sound alright?
B	so
A	we're going to
B	leave the next day at one thirty
A	it's Friday
B	yep
A	yeah
B	hungover to fuck but
A	that's fine though isn't it
B	you know
A	that's the good thing about it
B	yeah
A	so it's sleep day
B	Sunday's a complete write-off
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	dead
A	yeah
B	like we can drive down first thing or last thing
A	mm
B	well first thing probably
A	oh yes
B	no
A	she said it started off being ninety pounds a night and I was like holy Jesus that's ridiculous
B	mm
A	but to insist on people staying there and it be a hundred and thirty pounds
A	A hundred and thirty pounds
B	mm
A	and with the flight
B	yeah
A	unless I can find something in a boot sale
B	I reckon I can rock my er
A	mm
B	the one that looks like it's broken glass
A	yeah
B	I like that
A	Cos that's quite spring-like
B	I like that
A	exactly
B	so they don't know what I usually wear or whether this is out of character or not
A	well yes
B	lovely place to go
A	yes
B	as long as I look presentable they're not gonna care about my fashion sense are they
A	er no
B	ready?
A	shall we book it? Continuez
B	okay
B	luggage? We don't need to take luggage do we
A	no
B	yep
A	boring
B	travel insurance? Really not a point for what we're paying
A	I've got travel insurance
B	do you wanna take your skis? You've got travel insurance?
A	I do annual travel insurance
B	wow
A	and that's sixty er oh it's ten pounds so it's ten pounds every time you fly
B	mm
A	that far internationally
B	I did have annual for the past I haven't hadn't for the
A	I only yeah I mean er
B	mm
A	like
B	yeah
A	I won't have to worry about it every single time
B	do we have a promotional code?
A	um five five five five five five
B	do you want me to google it and find out if we have one
A	five five five five five
B	are we flying with easyJet?
A	easyJet er can you do that?
B	mm
A	promotional codes for easyJet
B	depends if they've got any going doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	so that's for February
A	mm
B	May two thousand and six
B	two thousand and six
B	right
A	this is all very long ago
A	per
B	yep
A	oh I hope we can get it
B	no
A	versus nine pounds
B	yep
A	and it's nearer
B	yep
A	so it's all much of a muchness
B	and even though it's further away from the hotel
A	mm
B	we'll get a cab from the hotel but then we can get train
A	exactly
B	so as opposed to cabbing the whole way
A	mm
B	okay
A	get in there  get in there  Oh I was supposed to call Chrissy tonight
B	hm hm hm
A	I just called to say I love you

A	it's game over
A	huh
A	it's happening
B	I've never been to the
A	er
B	I'm going to
A	well you're going to
B	well I've never been there
A	it's part of the UK
B	it's pretty exciting
A	and actually it's quite good that we're not going to
B	mm
A	Cos you land in the sea essentially
B	out
A	past the sea
B	oo
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh Dubai? I dunno about Europe
B	no
A	Venice
B	haven't been there
A	um
B	it's um
A	right I've run out of places now
B	mm
A	of places that I've flown to
B	it's somewhere like I dunno Corfu or something
A	huh
B	is it Corfu?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that's fucking scary
A	it was about ten nine o'clock by the time we landed
A	yeah
B	urgh
A	one of those awful like package holiday-esque things
B	yes
A	it is
B	only because you don't have to think
A	it is easy isn't it
B	like you actually don't have to think of anything
A	yeah
B	they just herd you like cattle
A	yeah
B	I mean the downside obviously is that they herd you like cattle
B	and um you have to get on the plane with the
A	mhm
B	and what we used to do was because we went on holiday quite often
A	mm
B	we had our own travel agent
A	mm
B	you know in this month or this month or this month and she would we'd say we'll be packed and ready to go you say where
A	mm
B	we'd basically pay a third of the price
A	nice
B	for like five star holiday
A	fuck
B	Cos someone at the last minute had to say no
A	mm
B	we didn't care where we were going
A	yeah
B	we'd just say yeah
A	just go
B	done
A	wow
B	so
A	that's awesome
B	I mean we only ever went to normal holiday places
A	mm
B	you know Ibiza or just normal family places
A	but it's just getting away though isn't it?
B	mm
A	mm
B	and she was like er yeah we'll do we've we've got this
A	mm
B	we'll go there
A	nice
B	which actually was very pretty when you went to see the volcano and the green lake and all that stuff
A	mhm
B	you know the tourist bits
A	mm
B	and we got there and we got on er some type of easyJet flight and er
A	oh bless
B	the
A	oh
B	they had carrier bags
A	oh
B	yeah
A	in fact I actually did get a flight for two P to
B	no
A	did you just get charged to pay on your card?
B	yeah
A	so do I owe you money for that though? How much did it come
B	no
A	did it still come to ninety-three? It was
B	yeah
A	altogether?
B	that was
A	oh okay
A	so essentially it was free for me
B	free
A	cost my mum two P
B	God
A	bargainous flight in the world
B	huh
A	I thought well I've had some really cheap flights in my life
B	this is probably equalling itself out
A	yeah when I flew back from Cuba Will and I booked our flights in the January sale
B	of course
A	um
A	and you sit in the Virgin flights you sit upstairs
B	really?
A	the whole shebang
A	and I said oh I got my flight in the January sale
B	huh
A	he was rich though
B	gutted to be you
A	at that point er I didn't realize how much of a deal it was
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and get a cheaper deal that way
B	just wait until the weekend
A	think they go down
B	and just say look I can go tomorrow
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	A few hundred quid
B	oh
A	Cos they wanna fill the plane
B	yeah
A	you I think you could probably talk them down
B	mm
A	for a seat to come up
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but if you're paying for a hotel
A	yeah
B	that's the killer isn't it? Cos then you
A	mm
B	you're paying for days in the hotel that you're not there
A	mm
B	oh do they?
A	Cos yeah what they do oh I wanna remember who was telling me this
B	whatever
A	so they'll just put them up in like er the nearest three star hotel for a couple of nights
B	mm
A	the airlines will actually give you quite a good deal
B	yeah
A	Cos and then
B	well it makes sense really doesn't it?
A	yeah and then you say oh I'm staying in a five star hotel when I get to Bangkok and they're like no you're not
A	you're staying somewhere that's gonna cost you
B	you're not
B	no
A	look at you
B	you say I work for IHG oh that's the thing um you know I always just think you know cheap hotels that's great
A	mm
B	but um I chose this one cos er of the feel of it
A	it's pretty nice
B	can't help but touch
A	I like all the um the the detail
B	er yes so
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
B	and the cheapest hotel he could possibly find was he was looking at two grand a night
A	no
B	I kid you not
A	how many of them are there?
B	um
A	fucking hell
B	five? Two grand a night
A	that's not possible though surely?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	er that's the point when you just think right back-packing around France with the family it is then
B	it is yeah
A	you can't have twenty-six grand holidays
B	no
A	mm
B	and now his whole holiday not including flights er for the two weeks is costing him two and a half grand
A	nice
B	compared to twenty-six
A	sweet
B	and you think really they could charge maybe not twenty-six grand but I'm sure it's about fifteen
A	wow
B	mm
A	that's mad isn't it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	at Easter where they're not guaranteed trade
A	mm
B	so yeah
A	mm
B	so he can get a family room
A	mm
B	for him and his wife and the two kids
A	wow
B	so it's one eighteen pound a go
A	lovely
B	well not eighteen pound for there but yeah
A	whatever it is
B	that's I mean if we go to Nottingham for my birthday
A	mm
B	we'll pay the eighteen pounds or twenty-five depending on which one we fall into
A	mm
B	but for four of us
A	hm
B	Cos it'll be two double beds
A	well if you don't mind doing it mate that's awesome
B	yeah
A	thank you
B	fucking
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	I figure we need to take them for all we can while I still work there
A	absolutely
B	I think it's probably wiser to do the twenty-eighth
A	mm
B	because people have been paid
A	that would be sensible
B	that is the thinker
A	true that  true that
B	so cos I I mean I don't really mind not doing it at my birthday time
A	well then to be honest the wedding we've now paid for the flight
B	oh yeah
A	you have a dress
B	mm
A	and a bit of petrol money
B	yeah so really
A	of money for drink
B	oh yeah
A	so you'd be doing that and then doing Nottingham
B	oh
A	so that would be a bit of a pisser
A	yeah
B	that might be a bit of a pisser
A	Sophie's wedding in
B	yeah
A	and I was looking at hotels in
B	in where?
A	yes
B	okay
A	oh
B	I don't know
A	even if it was fifty that'd be amazing
B	I'll tell you
A	oo
A	it's nice isn't it
B	er lovely
A	it's nice isn't it
B	oh look
A	where's the yeah yeah yeah whatever
B	huh
A	no hang on
B	mm
A	our best ever chic
B	yeah
A	I suppose you have to call up for a quote
B	that can't be right
A	I don't understand
B	forty-five pounds per person?
A	and they're having about a hundred people
B	yeah
A	so it's not very much is it
B	that can't be right
B	no it's not including the ceremony
A	by award-winning chefs with
B	that's not
A	I mean this is Belfast
B	this can't be that
A	this this I mean er you know this is very different
B	hm
A	so the and that's the evening buffet as well
B	that's just for the bride and groom though
A	mm
B	and the
A	oh it's really good isn't it?
B	the additional
B	based on thirty people for breakfast and a hundred guests for the evening
A	right
B	but and one bedroom is included
A	okay
B	but per person extra just to have them for the wedding breakfast is thirty-nine pounds per head
A	bloody hell
B	mm
B	Don't spare the horses
A	mow them down
B	yes
A	bit of cheeky vino
B	yes
A	huh
B	winner
A	when would I like to go? On the fifth of May

A	oh okay
B	and fill out a little voucher
A	lovely
B	which you then have

A	Cos you know it's like uh yes
A	you know the advert is bigger fatter gypsier
B	yeah
A	unions um and human rights groups have spoken out about the word gypsier
B	to the gypsies
A	oh you're insane
A	laughing at the gypsies
B	can't hear what she's saying
A	oo
B	it's fricking awesome
A	it's hitting the spot isn't it
B	oh polar bear man
A	oh where are my polar bears? What is with the eyebrows?
B	mm
A	my love
B	we actually um we had on a we have a board in our we have a massive whiteboard like the size of that space
A	mm
B	on the wall
A	mm
B	or weeks that we've got symposiums in or stuff so we can put the prices up
A	mm
B	so we know we're gonna be busy
A	okay
B	and um
A	what? Is that the official term?
B	when all the gypsies come for
A	oh yeah
B	they always try and book in the hotel
A	do they?
B	but none of the hotels let them in
A	right
B	we ended up I think with just one room
A	mm
B	they came to the hotel desk
A	no
A	shit
B	so
A	how do you turn them away without them stabbing
B	sorry
A	you in the eye?
B	sorry we're full
A	huh
A	and the Hilton put up with them?
B	Hilton don't get a choice
A	really?
B	if you out book someone then they don't know the client until they turn up
A	and then they and they can't turn them um away once they're there?
B	well they can but they'll probably
A	they're gypsies and they'll stab them in the eye
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	but
A	oh my God
B	out er even out of the bar
A	how how did they manage that? Just rip them down?
B	mm
A	shit
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I forgot my key
A	fuck me
B	bed linen
A	that's disgusting
B	curtains
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but then
A	well it's all very well protecting an old tradition traditional way of life and travelling around and making money by selling pots and pans but the fact that they just they steal and rob in order to
B	theft is against the law
A	in order to fund a lifestyle that means they don't have to get a job
B	no
A	we all have to get a job
B	mm
A	no I'm not having that
B	no
A	mm
B	I'm sure she is
A	mm
B	but she's nice enough
A	yeah yeah
B	she's obviously working for her money
A	right
B	we usually don't take group bookings over seventy
A	oh right
B	we probably take like three of thirty
A	okay
B	to make us up to sixty
A	oh okay
B	so we leave about half the hotel empty
A	mm
B	like an airline
A	okay
B	but we got a group booking this time
A	mm
B	we'd rather lose like maybe ten K for that night than risk the damage
A	mm
B	give me the money
A	yeah
B	yeah I'm awful
A	mm
B	Simon and I last week
A	that's what you do
B	accidentally priced the same job
A	mm
B	um
A	did you price it differently?
B	oh yeah
B	he gave them forty-two
A	that's hilarious
B	I mean to be fair I had allocated them a larger room
A	oh okay
B	so really
A	mm
B	had they pulled us up
A	mm
B	we were quite consistent
A	mm
B	but I'm more competitive than he is
A	mm
B	in fact if I know that when they turn up it looks like they warranted it
A	mm
B	and usually actually so far it's proved well
A	yeah
B	and then I'm I'll bump it down
A	mm
B	oh
A	no
A	but how I love the way that they complain like you're the one who wear this ridiculous monstrosity of a dress
B	that's her boyfriend hanging out the back
B	oh my God
A	right
B	so she went to school to get that dress
A	mhm
B	is what she's saying
A	yep
B	she doesn't care that she can now read and write
A	mm
B	she never gonna
A	mm
A	mm I wouldn't be so confident that she can read and write
A	she went to one out of ten classes so she could get the prom
B	oh my God
A	do they all die at forty or something? If you're a gypsy
B	what's happening to her face?
A	that's a gypsy
B	look at them painting her face
A	they're painting her face
B	did you see how thick that foundation was?
B	race?
A	yeah
B	ask for something?
A	yeah
B	specifically
A	specifically
B	feel quite sick now
A	yeah
B	no
B	I mean that's it
A	yeah
B	how's she getting on that then?
B	huh
A	how do parents not look at their children when they do that and think fuck I've created a monster
B	monster
A	oh
B	yeah she does
A	and I mean I'm a you know I'm a humanist but for the good of humanity put her down
B	yep
A	fff
B	what is wrong with her skin?
A	well it's been painted hasn't it
B	I've no idea
A	like the guitarist presumably
B	mm
A	shitting hell
B	I know
A	it's awful isn't it?
A	oh grabbing
B	look
A	no they they literally do grab them
B	rape
A	what is that? Is that a man?
B	he's stealing the cake
A	fine
B	er er where did they just go?
B	where is it?  Whiter teeth
A	mm
B	that's her entire life dream
A	fuck me
A	um huh
B	yeah
A	uh
B	I think it's just the last one I'm not up to date with
A	right
B	aren't they up to something like series eight now or something?
A	yeah
B	so Liz who are you proposing to tomorrow?
A	oh my God
B	okay
A	oh God

B	which one?
A	who Knew
B	who Knew
A	yeah
B	right
A	and er I couldn't work out had I ordered it in my sleep? I don't even like Pink
B	right
A	and he said oh it was oh you know I heard it on the radio and there was a lyric and it was really appropriate for how I felt
B	if this is
A	it's your mum?
B	no it's
A	oh
B	yes
A	here is a card of cats
A	here is a poem
B	huh
A	oh is it? Cos I didn't get it
B	yeah
A	I don't know the song
B	I think so
A	yeah
B	fff
A	Julie was like it's really sweet
B	that is really sweet
B	I can't believe it
B	what are you gonna do?
A	I dunno
B	no
A	Cos I've
B	no no no no
A	I definitely would have received it
B	oh
A	and it's very sweet for him to take er the take the time to do it
B	are you sure you don't want to encourage anything?
A	definitely
B	you do know the song
A	I just all I can
A	oh
A	oh I don't know the words
A	so is that what it is then?
A	oh it's that one
A	mm
A	oh
B	and she sings something like
A	oh okay
B	it's like it's really like a nice it's a
A	yes
B	story song
A	yeah
B	and time makes it harder and something else
A	it is really sweet
B	and it's it's basically like growing with someone is the thing
B	how sure are you about this response?
A	er a hundred and ten per cent
B	right
A	because
B	when was the last time you saw this boy?
A	um
B	okay
B	and why do we not want to encourage him?
A	there just  there just  is nothing to encourage
B	lovely friend
A	and I have tried
B	mm
A	I'm just not it's just not
B	but what happens if he's changed since the last time you saw him
A	yeah
B	maybe now he's hot
A	I mean he's cute
B	fitter
A	and he keeps he got er got a really trim body
A	stuff that was in the
B	oh
A	Topless
B	oh
A	which was quite a sight to behold
B	if you're taking it as a mick take
A	yeah
B	mm
A	one of them
B	eleven
A	and what does she do now?  God that's quite dedicated isn't it? For a teenager
A	to go actually I'm gonna go to school
B	what?
A	it's mental isn't it
B	is she?   She looks like she has and all
B	I thought she said seventy-nine
B	and some contraception by the sounds of things
A	huh
B	oh Liz
A	but the thing is when you do your First Holy Communion you're six or seven years
B	look at the little child next to her
A	aw
B	see how did they get her hair like that? Cos I want to know how to do that
A	did you not see all her hair in bandages?
B	wrap
A	can you see her bawling her eyes out as well though?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh Jesus
A	such a stressful experience
B	mm
A	Christ
B	they're always late for everything
A	mm
B	their weddings
A	mm
B	she looks like a bull-dog chewing a wasp
B	she's going to church in that
A	fine
B	my Communion was a bit boring
A	where are these people these children's parents? That's what I don't understand
B	praising the Lord
A	praising the Lord
B	well
A	was it about Luton?
B	yes
A	and the EDL? Was it really bad?
B	um
A	oh yeah
B	but um actually it makes me sound really racist but some of the stuff he was saying was quite true
A	what were they saying?
B	I only saw a small part of it
A	mhm
B	um
A	mm
B	really extreme
A	yeah but they're putting those two things together and confusing the matter
B	no
A	and in your mind making the connection that all Muslims are extremists
B	no he wasn't actually
A	but they're not
B	no
B	he said there's only three per cent of the country that is Muslim
A	mm
B	however that means that there's ninety-seven per cent
A	mm
B	which are other religions
A	mm
B	in the percentage of the three per cent
A	mm
B	which are extreme Muslims which are they're putting all these posters on the street
A	mm
B	um recruiting more radical Muslims
A	mm
B	to follow this guy's name I don't know cos I wasn't really paying a lot of attention
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	but the the kind of idea of a conversion rate between the three percent Muslim
A	mm
B	and the percentage of those that are extreme
A	mm
B	was really very high
A	mm
B	craziness
A	mm
B	the conversion rate is much smaller
A	exactly
B	it's the crazy people
A	yeah
B	and he said but either way the only correlation is the thing that they believe in
A	mm
B	then can you imagine when we become more multi-cultural and twenty per cent of the country is Muslim?
A	mm
B	once you up that conversion rate you're to an extent that we won't be able to control anymore
A	mm
B	and it wasn't he wasn't as racist as I expected him to be
A	mm
B	like I expected it to be like holy fuck this this man needs burning at the stake
A	mm
B	and he he was er he was really quite extreme but he wasn't irrational
A	mm
B	but um I know it er doesn't really make sense does it
A	I think it's all  it's all  it's just what he says is very suspicious
B	yeah
A	that he's actually done any proper research
B	yeah
A	wanted to believe what he's saying
B	that's what the filmer was saying
A	and you know we live in an actual fact like white British people are becoming more secular
B	mm
A	so we're er veering away from being a religious country
B	yep
A	which is allowing for a greater rise in other types of religion
B	yeah
A	whether it's Muslim or Sikh or
B	those gypsies
A	gypsies
A	I mean the fact is
B	yeah
A	anyone can believe what they like so long as they're not indoctrinating other people
B	yeah
A	it's it's all dangerous
B	it's all that's the thing
A	and he's gonna say anything he can
B	yeah
A	they're more eloquent
B	yeah
A	that they should join because their jobs are being taken
B	that's exactly what he was doing  that's exactly what he was doing
A	they go to areas that are struggling
B	he was saying that this is part of history
A	mm
B	there might've been part of your argument initially which I agreed with
A	mm
B	I wouldn't never
