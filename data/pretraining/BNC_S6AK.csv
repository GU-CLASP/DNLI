A	no just I just want the
B	no well it isn't anyway
C	you want the information
A	just want the information
C	sixteenth century manor house
B	but it doesn't look like it there does it? at all? looks like a
A	probably just set back it's probably
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	must be a difficult way to take a photo
A	so
B	yeah
A	gets a bit congested with traffic in certain areas
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
B	erm
B	they they haven't they're not doing
C	no
B	they did it last year
C	mm yeah
B	and we thought we'll stay at
C	yeah
C	they've just got
B	we didn't have that one either
C	there are so many youth hostels got shut down like
B	mm
C	it's not it's not
B	they are changing quite a lot aren't they?
C	a business to make lots of money
A	they have to make money don't they?
C	well they just spent over a million pound on a youth hostel in Cambridge
A	mm
B	they are unique
C	they're so unique it's untrue
B	yeah
C	but you know all they're doing is now changing them into guest houses if you like great big hotel type places
B	mm
C	where you can get grub and be fed and what have you
B	they'll still keep the others won't they?
C	well hopefully if they can get enough er volunteers
A	yeah
C	oh they'll always be busy yeah
A	you know with the dales and things like that
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	the Yorkshire
C	yes
A	I suppose it's the ones in cities that they have the problems with
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
C	no
B	it wasn't very
A	the one in
C	oh that was awful
B	yeah yeah
C	awful
A	no they built houses they built flats on there so
C	yeah
B	mm
C	and er
C	but er they're run by managers full full time
B	but they were talking about getting one on the Broads
C	yeah a new one
C	talking about getting a new one
B	doing one there cos
A	yeah
B	and that would be a a good area to do one really
C	well there's only two youth hostels in the whole of Norfolk
A	so what
C	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm they did have
C	no we never went there
B	just a house on the street you know?
C	yeah
A	yeah it gotta have some
B	you can't just have
A	and they've gotta
B	yeah
C	yeah they've gotta wifi they gotta have all that sorta stuff
B	and now we're going to have to make beds
C	and now they want us to make instead of putting all the
C	the linen out they want
A	they want you to make them
C	us to make
B	I wrote to them and said we don't usually get out till about one anyway
C	no
B	erm
A	that's that's the whole point of it
C	I don't know if they can
B	especially bunk beds
A	yeah
B	to do
C	yeah
B	especially the bottom sheet
A	and yeah
B	erm
C	I don't know whether they're going to do it yet
C	next year yeah
B	but we were sent a little thing saying what do we think?
C	but we said
B	put our
A	that's a lot of stuff to do
C	well if you've gotta make twenty odd beds a day
A	with quilt with quilts and covers and
C	yeah
A	if you have quilt covers and things
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and maybe this is a ploy to get the ones that have have to be volunteered
B	but they're lots they can't shut down can they?
C	yeah some of them they can't shut down they've got to be youth hostels
C	they can't sell them
C	er has got a covenant on
B	mm
C	they try to sell it they can only get a pound for it
A	right
C	because that was given by these
A	yeah
C	you know?
B	but the ones that have erm National Trust quite
C	yeah
B	you know? what for really but
C	but some of them
B	it's a shame
A	they'll make money they'll make
C	yeah
B	mm
A	National Trust will make more money out of them
C	yeah they would
A	their
B	yeah
A	National Trust cottages are expensive
B	yeah
C	they are
B	so they're only on lease for the moment
C	well some some of the youth hostels have been taken over by private people
B	mm
C	the Youth Hostel Association
B	they're still
C	mm
B	which would be quite nice if we
C	I mean we did go in where where's that one we went in that that needed an awful amount of work I think
B	erm
C	very damp
B	at
B	yeah it's only that was only twelve beds that one
C	that was only twelve beds that
B	right in the middle of the woods
C	in the middle of the
B	lovely it's a lovely cottage
C	yeah
B	lovely cottage
B	but er
C	god it needed work
B	because the walls how they are there's all these creepy for
C	yeah
B	all
C	yeah
B	you know
C	yeah
A	they'd have to
B	mm
C	but er
B	there's so many spiders
C	I mean there was spiders everywhere
B	well
A	that's what it's for though innit?
B	old stone
C	yeah
B	cottage
C	yeah
B	yeah that's what it's for
C	brilliant place we liked it didn't we?
B	yes
C	walking in the forest
B	yeah
C	you couldn't get lost there because the A3
B	yeah we didn't know about that
C	but you could hear it when we were in the woods
B	yeah
C	you could hear but they now put a tunnel
B	was it big enough? no
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	the tube line yeah I saw someone but yeah
A	ah amazing
C	yeah
B	mm
A	absolutely amazing
C	yeah
A	all the tunnels are now
C	yeah and er
B	oh
A	they're all dug
C	yeah
A	lay all the tracks and everything
C	cor
B	mm
A	great big boring machine the way that it does it
C	they're huge
B	yeah
C	they and and they
C	yeah
A	amazing I cos I showed
C	oh yeah
A	and the so the idea is the accuracy that they have to bend the paper they have to fold it
B	oh right
A	and then they have to make the keystone to put in and then we put weights on to see
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	what isn't
C	yeah
A	and what happens if you don't have the pillar either side
C	that's it yeah
A	in the thing
B	mm
A	something on TV about it
C	all together yeah
A	so I show them that old technology's still being used
C	yeah
A	even now
C	yes it is yeah
B	right
C	yeah
A	but they some of the areas they have to drain
C	yeah
A	there's so much water behind they have to put great big taps in
C	yeah they've
A	to take the water way
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	amazing
C	yeah
C	they've come across a burial ground too haven't they?
C	yeah
A	which they think was the
C	yeah
A	but there was this arch
C	oh right
A	but when they started
C	oh crikey
B	oh
A	and
C	yeah
A	it took longer to get out because the way the concrete was made and the pressure that'd been put on
C	yeah
A	had really made it tight and it just wouldn't just wouldn't snap
C	wouldn't budge
B	no
A	and then there was one bit that goes under the docks
C	did they
A	so that they could put
A	the new tunnel in
C	yeah
A	and it's one of the big exos exhibition centres down there
A	could be used which was like a military show where
B	wow
A	army boats navy boats went up etcetera
A	and they just did it on time
C	couldn't get it out
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	gosh
A	they're I mean absolutely
C	when was that built
A	eighteen something
C	yeah
A	it was and it used to have
C	was it down by Brunel or something like that?

A	amazing
B	mm
A	and it's just so many people working on it
C	yeah
A	you know so many people working on the whole line
C	fantastic innit I mean when you think about the work and the and the brains that go into it all
A	you know and there's a guy who this is gonna be his last tunnel
C	wow
B	yes
A	and his sons are into it as well
C	yeah
A	and he's
C	yeah

C	oh right
A	and do it
C	no you're not
A	you know? if you make a
C	yeah
A	if you don't have the experience
C	no chance
A	and
A	of course they was like
B	yeah
A	I said because if you use the marking knife
C	you've good start
A	you've got a good start for when you put your tenon saw in
C	yeah
A	and you've actually got somewhere the er tenon saw can go in
C	yeah
A	and of course for the people that
B	yeah
A	well maybe just a pencil
C	yeah
A	you'd get a
C	yeah
A	then of course it's like oh couldn't give the kids a marking knife
C	yeah
A	they will be using them
B	mm
A	and then he went
C	uhu
A	and I go and I though oh I'm not gonna say anything here cos this is just not right
C	yeah that has yeah yeah
A	a mortise gauge has two pins because you set the size of your mortise
C	your mortise yeah
A	on your pins
C	yeah
A	and you and then this one guy's oh that's only if you're going across the grain isn't it?
C	oh
A	mm well if you're doing a mortise and tenon
C	yeah
A	cos you're marking the edge
C	course you can
B	yeah
A	and I just thought oh this is
B	yeah
A	tick tick tick tick tick
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's
C	yeah
A	updated mine four years ago
B	yeah
A	cos I got quite a few
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	well I never
B	mm
C	but when when er I I had a woodwork teacher
A	you keep you keep the edge against it
C	keep the edge up against it and you
A	yeah
C	and it's
C	it
A	no
C	oh right
A	I though well go on show her how to chisel
A	don't just talk about it show us how to chisel
A	I do like saying I do like saying you know what what chisel is that one there?
A	and it was like
C	no
A	and it was like
C	yeah
A	that's what she needs the training on
C	yeah
A	eh
C	he didn't show her?
A	no
C	no
A	but she had to do the band saw
C	mm mm
A	but it was and then the
A	that looks dangerous
B	mm
C	a scroll saw
A	yeah
C	you can yeah
A	loads and loads
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos you'd have to sign this one next time but I've done the competency on
A	cos he made me he made me use the band saw
C	did he?
A	yeah
C	oh right
A	yeah
C	oh that was easy enough
A	oh it was so difficult
A	I did everything I could to make it see if he'd notice what I did wrong but he didn't
C	no?
B	oh
A	I watched the guy use a push stick
C	yeah
A	so you can put it on the edge of the wood
C	that's it
A	but if you're pushing it through that way you can turn it on its side
C	that's right yeah
A	and hold the corner
C	yeah
A	and push and like
C	yeah
A	like that
C	did you do it?
A	yeah course I did
A	course I did cos I turned it on its side like that
C	oh right
A	rather than on the top because it gets in the way
C	it does
A	and then we had to do a bit of
C	yeah
A	band saw well
C	that that's about half an inch wide well three three eights of an inch or whatever
A	and it was like
C	yeah
A	I said this is really just for cutting straight down
C	yeah?
A	yeah
C	what declogging the sand disc?
A	well I knew how to declog it cos you can buy a special soap that you
C	yeah you can
A	and like a rubber that you can put on
C	yeah
A	which
C	yeah? oh right
A	and just gently put the piece of perspex on
C	yeah
A	but he did say that can actually catch fire
C	did he?
A	yeah
C	oh right
A	he said because what happens is the bits of plastic that come off that
B	mm
A	which a little bit of a
C	yeah
A	are hot so therefore going down into the vacuum chamber
C	yeah
A	go off
C	when we used to
A	oh yeah
C	and you used to have to the the
A	file card
C	file card don't you? to unclog it all
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	should have that
C	yeah
A	d'you need a file card?

C	I ain't got enough copper I ain't got any copper to make that
A	copper sheet
C	well anyway I've made them out of aluminium
