A	yeah
B	do you want a drink of anything?
A	yeah I might do
B	well it looks like you've got most things you own in that big bag
A	yeah pretty much
B	well I'm surprised I've got three bags clothes the rest of it's like food and bits and pieces I've bought I've bought an iron this time
A	oh
B	I'm just not sure what'll be in these I mean in the last place it had iron and ironing board didn't it?
A	well I just like brought quite a lot of stuff
B	yeah it's better to have it there's plenty of room in the car so you may as well
A	yeah that's what I thought
B	and if you got a
A	yeah
B	but you'd probably better not have to start washing and stuff isn't it?
A	yeah
B	when you can bring enough clothes to the waterpark so
A	I always feel like I've forgotten something but I don't think there's anything that I would forget
B	your toiletries and it looks like you have plenty of clothes that's all you need really isn't it?
A	yeah and I mean if I've forgot like and I don't have any toothpaste but I thought you'd bring that
B	oh right yeah
A	but like if I forgot something like soap or something like I could just buy some
B	yeah and I've I've bought just clean stuff extra stuff like that cos you don't know what stuff will be there
A	oh did you yeah did you bring a spray? a side spray and?
B	yeah
A	oh good good
B	cos I think last time I gave the place a spray down in the kitchen
B	oh did I not bring one no?
A	no I don't think so and I was like oh wait we should get one and erm I went a bit mad with the spray
A	yeah do you not remember? we had to open all the doors
B	yeah
A	no yeah I thought it was going to be roasting
A	because I woke up this morning and I was like
B	yeah it seemed to be quite bright and warm earlier on it's clouded over
A	but then I went outside cos I heard the cats and I said I better so I went out and I was like
B	maybe your house holds the heat longer
A	yeah I think it does
B	so your mammy's room it's erm
A	yeah it's done
B	looking good isn't it? it's yours next
A	yeah I think they were waiting for me to go
B	it will be nice when you go away and you come back and it'll be much improved won't it?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it must be a bit chaotic living there at the moment is it?
A	er yeah I don't know
B	well especially with your your grandma and grandad having to sleep in the lounge in his boxers on and I mean where do you go when you want to where you can relax and sit down?
A	in my room
B	what about when you're eating?
A	in the kitchen
B	oh right cos there's nowhere really if you all want to sit down and talk or eat or anything?
A	we've been in the garden or in the kitchen
B	mm
A	like we never sat in the lounge really in our other house
A	no I never really used it I was always in my room anyway
B	well your kitchen was a more reasonable size though wasn't it? you could all sit in there and
A	yeah
B	yeah I meant to
A	it was so nice that Indian yeah it was really nice yeah
B	good
A	yeah
B	what did you have?
A	I had
B	oh that's
A	no they I don't they didn't really have that much vegetarian stuff I don't know if you can ask
B	cos proper well proper Indian cooking is
A	yeah yeah it's really nice
B	cos mainly cos most of a lot are vegetarians aren't they? in
A	yeah
B	more of it's vegetarian food
A	she had like a lentils thing she really liked it yeah
B	oh so it wasn't too spicy?
A	no well I had a sweet one and she had one that was like well it wasn't spicy at all it said mild
B	mm
A	and it wasn't spicy cos I tried it and it had like lentils in it or something
B	oh right
A	I think grandad had a a balti
B	oh
A	and mammy had a korma cos I was going to
B	so everyone enjoyed it?
A	yeah
B	did you have poppadoms and things first?
A	I had a well had poppadoms but we didn't get erm other starters because you you can't
B	no it's too filling
A	we barely even ate the curry
B	yeah but the poppodoms are not too filling are they? always worth having
A	yeah
B	what time did you go there?
A	about seven
B	was it busy?
A	it was actually we almost didn't get a table
B	really?
A	yeah because
B	why did you not book it?
A	well no because eh we thought it wouldn't be that busy we were going to go a little bit
B	yeah seven's quite busy
A	yeah we thought it wouldn't be that busy erm and on the website it didn't really you know say like oh book you know cos some of them do they say like oh we're quite busy and whatever so you should book
B	mm
A	and it didn't say anything like that we went and they were like oh no we've got no rooms and we were like leaving and the guy came after us and was like no no we've found you a table so
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	that would have been a bit of a shame what would you have done?
A	I don't know
B	looked for somewhere else?
A	yeah probably but they probably thought there's like four of them
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and we didn't know if they would like
B	really?
A	yeah
B	well I've I I've brought lots of vegetables for you
A	have you?
B	to practise being a vegetarian
A	mm I'm not really I don't know like I'm quite fussy about curries I don't really like
B	no I wasn't going to do it spicy
A	mm
B	chilli spicy you can add chilli to it if you wanted to but things like butternut squash aubergines peppers it's really nice one of those
A	ah yes do you know I love butternut squash?
B	you know the actual vegetables that I'm I was going to use
A	yeah
B	I've done it a couple of times and I've got a
A	ah butternut squash butternut squash is like the best
B	so it's quite different
A	it's so nice but we never buy it cos I can't peel it and it's
B	well no you either put the thing in and what you have to help
B	cos the whole point of it is so you can
A	well I've actually found out a good way of peeling butternut squash we just don't but it usually cos it's a bit expensive
B	well what I do is I I cut it into little smaller manageable chunks and peel it
A	but it's not like a
B	what's that?
A	the skin's really hard and I just can't get my knife into it and I end up like cutting my hand open
B	you need a small knife though to do it
A	but I can do it with a peeler now because what you do is I I found this on some cooking website cos I was like I need some help I really like butternut squash but I can't cook it so I looked it up online and it's like right what you have to do is you poke loads of holes in it stick it in the microwave and it softens the skin and you can just peel it off cos it's like it's not it's not like cooked
B	it just softens
B	oh right how many? how long do you have to put it in the microwave for?
A	a few minutes
B	what? the whole butternut squash?
A	yeah you just sort of spin it round
B	yeah but you don't want to
A	why?
B	cos you get more of the flavours then don't you? and the actual whole dish if you're putting it in with other things
A	yeah
B	and it's like it's nice like in a curry slow cooked on a low heat and you get
A	yeah but you're just going to put it in anyway
B	yeah but
A	yeah but you don't microwave all of it
B	well I know yeah but you'll you'll microwave quite an important element possibly
B	well that's the flesh yeah it's alright if the skin softens a bit but once it starts cooking it's the flesh it's you're changing the cooking process
B	it's an exact science to cook things properly
A	I know but it just
B	it's like mixing chemicals in the wrong
A	I thought
B	but you can't peel everything with a peeler can you?
A	well I've managed alright
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	I didn't bring the peeler
B	ah
A	cos I'm trying not to cut my fingers
B	well what kind of?
A	yeah
B	you just have you're your hand you're holding with away from so you hold it there and peel that way
B	so how are you going to cut it if it's not in the vicinity of?
A	it slips or like it jams into me and the I'm like nearly stabbing myself and
B	yeah but if it if it slips it's going to go that way
A	yeah up your arm
B	well you you have to learn some knife skills
A	because baking is like the
B	yeah you have to
A	yeah and the the
B	yeah you can have a bit more throwing things together depending on what you want but like the serious chefs you know? you're cooking like
A	well it looks art doesn't it? when they put it when they put it on the plate it looks like a painting
B	well yeah
A	looks good
B	we can get away with whatever can't we?
A	no but I think those Michelin chefs would agree that cooking is an art form
A	they
B	there is a science to it you have to understand how ingredients go together
A	yeah well that well you could
B	erm no cos I mean they're not making the paint are they?
A	no but like the like the when you
B	mm
A	mixed forms like you can't erm really like you can't paint over acrylics in watercolours can you?
B	no I mean well I suppose when you get to the down to all the nitty gritty there's there's science in everything really isn't there really?
A	well yeah
B	nothing works without science
A	yeah
B	yeah I've got to get fuel we won't get very far with the amount of fuel that I have
A	oh can I get some Nectar points?
B	yeah?
A	oh do you not do Nectar?
B	no
A	think I've got a Nectar card
B	I'll start filling it up
A	okay yeah
B	or else can I do it at the pump here? no?
A	can't you?
B	no
