A	and erm one day I erm I went up to his house and knocked on his door and I said his girlfriend were there or his wife or whatever and I said so I said is

A	he he looked at me and he were like and then he like just turned round like this like and started looking straight forward and he didn't look at me or speak to me again
B	how many kids has he got? sorry
A	six
B	wow
A	not including me and they're the ones that I know about so he picks me up and at the end of it I said do you know who I am? he said and he he like started stuttering like

A	and he just looked at me like oh that's erm six pound love so I gave him I gave him my money

B	right
A	and erm a few months ago he he found out that I'm doing well he found out that I'm at uni
B	one of them people that
A	and he's added me on Facebook and I'm like you fucking prick
B	yeah
A	I'm twenty-two years old right?
B	now you want to know
A	and now you want to fucking know me twenty-two fucking years later twenty-two years later like I still talk to his kids they're called
B	yeah but
A	you know and yeah and they love me and I love them blah blah blah so and
B	have you got a diary or
A	yeah a journal
B	you need you need to write all this down this is gonna make a right biography
B	I think er something like that'd be very interesting to read cos I'm blown away by read by listening to it and I can't even fucking keep up with it me
A	no it's not that interesting unless you're
A	mm
B	I've got nothing to relate to so when I
A	cos you have yeah
A	yeah
B	have you got a creative side like that? do you like enjoy writing
A	I study English language and literature
B	I'm saying do you enjoy writing
A	I love writing
B	okay
A	really love writing
B	you've got subjects that I'd love to write about summat like that
A	I know but
B	I know it sounds really harsh but honestly
A	it does but like it's so weird cos like do you know all my uni friends? I only met them like in September or whatever or like over the last year I've met them and they know nothing about me and it's so weird cos like they all think that I've got this amazing life and they think oh you've gone to America
B	you have got a pretty amazing life though
A	no but the but the thing is I've had a shit life up until now
A	and people don't realise that
B	you might think like that though but I think you'll realise you've had a very interesting life and I don't think
A	I have er no it made me who I am
B	cos you've
A	it's definitely not been good
B	but it's built you into a character hasn't it?
A	no I don't get fucked about by anyone
B	no yeah by
A	pardon?
B	by
A	fucking cunt
A	applicable's a big word well not actually because people say that all the time like application or applicable it's not a very big word actually not anymore it used to be but it's not anymore
B	I'll try harder next time shall I?
A	yeah so you should you should no but like all my uni friends
B	I'm running er
B	I'm not doing that bad
A	but it's so weird cos like all my uni friends see my life from the outside and they see this amazing life they say ah you went to America you've done this and I'm not an amazing person
A	I'm bog standard and blah blah blah
B	rough as owt
A	rough as owt and but like they just look from the outside and they see this they see this person and they just think oh my god your life's amazing you're so lucky and then I think if you actually knew
B	what you went through
A	what I've been through to get to where I am now then you wouldn't think that like but I don't wanna sit and tell my life story to every single person that I meet
B	yeah it's really interesting though I'm not I'm not I've never been bored in in the last ten minutes
A	for ten minutes
A	thanks I'll just stop talking shall I?
B	no I'm not saying that's a bad thing
B	I'm not saying it feel like it does feel like
A	mm yeah
A	yeah me too
B	because I've had a family where I have been lucky enough to be stable and everything so when I say things like about my mum and dad I realise that other people don't have a stable mum and dad
A	yeah
B	for most of their lives so
A	er you feel bad don't you?
A	mm
B	and some of my mates have never been abroad and I can't identify with that cos I wanna say I I've never been abroad
A	you can't understand yeah
B	so it's like that very interesting though
A	no before I were my first my first trip abroad were when I was
B	you have rolled me a shit fag here
A	I'm sorry
B	that's alright
A	I do roll them too tight sometimes my first trip abroad the one I paid for like I used to lie a lot so I I moved out of my mum and dad's when I was sixteen and I lived er I've lived on my own since I was sixteen
B	yeah
A	and I and when you meet new new people they normally make an they make an assumption about you about straightaway it's human human nature you make a judgement about someone
B	yeah
A	in the first ten seconds
A	yeah me too and I used to lie a lot like I
B	yeah
A	I wanted people to think that I was this person that I wasn't like I used to make up lies like oh yeah my parents took me to Disneyland and my parents are well off but I just don't see them very much cos they're working all the time
B	yeah
A	it were a complete fucking lie my parents have never taken me abroad my parents have never done a lot of things for me but the the one thing I could say for my parents they might not've had a lot of money to give me what I wanted but they always gave me what I needed
B	yeah yeah
A	and there's a big difference
B	you
A	no like clothes and food and stuff like that like some kids go wanting for that
B	yeah yeah
A	but my parents always gave me what I needed not necessarily what I wanted like a trip to Disneyland or whatever
A	yeah
B	why can't I always have stuff like that?
A	yeah
B	and then you realise as you get older it don't matter mate like your family were there for you when you when you needed them
A	exactly
B	and all the rich kids that I know now are all just live off their mum and dads they don't have
A	they don't have any er self-respect do they? or integrity or anything like that
A	yeah
B	and you know you you're gonna be a better person for it
A	even if you don't have a lot of money it don't matter you've had a better life
B	yeah yeah experience does count for a lot more than money
A	yeah
B	and you've had quite a good experience as far as I can tell
B	so you can see how shit their life is and you're like look what I'm doing
A	and that's why and that's why I brag a lot not because my life is that amazing I make out it's more amazing than it is on Facebook because a lot of the people who used to bully me and used like cos I used to hang around with all the lads cos I'm not a girly girl
B	yeah
A	like I was a slag and I was a slut and I shagged everything that moved blah blah blah like that's what I were to all the girls
B	right
A	but all of them who called me a slag got pregnant at fifteen
B	yeah
A	and I'm just and that's why I put a lot of things on my Facebook that I do because I just think do you know what? you fucking brought me down and said all this shit about me but who's got a better life now?
B	but
A	yeah
B	I don't ever think I don't ever begrudge you it I don't ever think like oh
B	I don't
A	big words
B	I don't ever think like oh like oh what a dickhead for doing it I would think like that's good like she's sorting her zen out she's doing er she she's got engaged that's a pretty cool thing
A	no I don't know about that
B	do you know what? do you know what though? and I've I've been the last year at the uni cos I'm I'm a bit more mature than some of my mates who are like gone to uni but when you go to uni at eighteen I don't think you're ready for it
A	no
A	there should be a
B	do you wanna go inside? I'm cold
A	yeah do you wanna go inside?
B	so erm I I feel this all all my mates have been talking about stuff that's happened and and I'm like twenty-one now so I'm I'm not mature by any means but I'm much more mature than I was so
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't've been able to handle uni but right now it's about the time I
A	yeah but just to have a a relationship
B	but I would be I would be ready to ready for summat like that and er I reckon
