A	so it looks nice the whole time instead of just when it's full
B	yeah
A	well yeah there is that actually I hadn't thought about that
B	oh my god did you see the did you see the
A	I was just checking it was working
B	oh
A	mm
B	oh
A	mm well I've seen the Madonna thing
B	I was watching it and it was live and it was
A	oh that must have been so embarrassing the poor woman
B	oh cos you can see her panicking
A	yeah
B	like she's singing
A	what cos she is she like strangled or something?
B	no she's
A	or just embarrassed kind of thing?
B	she's got the
A	yeah
B	and I think she knows that
A	yeah
B	they're gonna pull the cape and she's got to have it loose when they do that because they're not gonna know that she hasn't undone it yet
A	oh okay
B	so then she you can see her she starts like trying to get it undone and then like it gets a bit more frantic and then they just pull it and she like goes backwards
A	oh my god yeah
B	and it must have strangled her actually
A	it must have really hurt
B	because it's round her neck
A	yeah
B	it's around her neck my god I didn't even think that
A	and then afterwards she must have thought shit
B	yeah
A	in front of all of those people
B	she didn't say anything though did she? like you would have heard her scream
A	yeah
B	cos there was the microphone
A	that's true
B	she was very professional
A	yeah did she just carry on afterwards?
B	yeah she just kind of like
A	yeah
B	and then
A	after that it's all lost really
B	oh my
A	you may as well just finish wouldn't you?
B	god
A	no one's gonna be taking any notice anymore
B	that's so bad yeah
A	it's so funny
B	I bet heads are gonna roll for that like especially the costume designer
A	do you think? well it's a mistake though
B	you should use Velcro
A	well yeah there is that
B	for god's sake
A	kind of
B	why would you
A	or some kind of thing that's just gonna easily
B	yeah
A	oh I've forgotten my
B	what's that?
A	I've got something crusty on my neck
A	and I don't know what that is
B	I found something there earlier as well
A	I hate it when you suddenly find a crust on your back
A	grim
B	oh that needs to be in the book
A	you haven't even got the book now
B	I don't I think
A	oh yeah
B	but I've got a copy of it
A	I want a photocopy of it
B	I copied it yeah photocopy's nice because I copied it all out by hand but it was nice to see like see the different handwriting
A	yeah
B	and also it doesn't take so long
A	yeah
B	that took me a long time
A	I know
B	mm
B	yeah we were we love that book I love that book it's in my desk
A	it's funny
B	yeah
A	I will
B	I will keep it free anyway just in case
A	well don't if don't like
B	I've not got plans
A	anything
B	on on my
A	I'm not going to be doing anything it's gonna be it's just sucks that they're
B	okay
A	that Monday is my day
B	I know
A	no it's like a strict thing
B	yeah I guess they must have to be quite strict
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	looking for jobs
B	that's true
A	uhu
B	when I first moved to London and
A	refused you?
B	yeah
A	why?
B	because
A	you moved away?
B	I moved away I finished my degree
A	yeah
B	they said no
A	that's very strange
B	I know but all I the only thing I managed to get out of them was
A	so you
B	since my job
A	well I've done that
B	I know but I don't know why they and erm
A	that's a oh
B	yeah the only thing I got from them because I literally had zero money zero zero zero zero
A	yeah that's what I did
B	was a travel card cos I said I've got an interview I can't get there
A	yeah
B	what am I supposed to do? I have no money to to eat to get the bus
A	that's ridiculous
B	so then they gave me like
A	well I guess that's something but
B	yeah
A	that's stupid because it just discourages people from taking jobs then cos you think well I may as well not take this job because I may as well just go on Jobseeker's if they're gonna start punishing people for having a job which essentially is what they've done to you
B	yeah
A	I mean it's not like
B	mm
A	you would have got money from the government like how why does that make sense?
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	to get an actual job
A	oh
B	well what are they like aye?
A	ridiculous
B	oh my god
A	yeah
B	you know about how I set up
A	and then you were like well I hope I've got it
B	yeah cos I had to have internet and I had to buy something to get the internet
A	yeah
B	and I had to take sandwiches from work home to eat because I didn't have any money to buy food
A	oh no could you not apply for a different?
B	but that's so funny
A	there must be some kind of other benefit you can look out for
B	er probably but I didn't I didn't bother
A	yeah
B	well if I just
A	at least you're alright now aren't you?
B	pardon?
A	you're alright now aren't you?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah I'm good now actually mum's helping me now
A	oh that's nice
B	which is nice it's really really nice I'm really lucky because she can she's never been able to before and she sold the house quite recently
A	so she's got a bit more income to do it yeah
B	and so she said cos I was really worried cos my job was ending and I was doing what you're doing like
A	yeah
B	sending out application application application not hearing anything back and also it was really difficult cos I had to find something that wasn't
A	okay
B	but that was enough money part time to support me
A	uhu
B	well and do and flexible hours for for uni
A	yeah
B	just pass the degree I will
A	oh that's so nice
B	it's a loan
A	yeah
B	I've decided that it's a loan and I'm gonna pay her back when I
A	yeah when you've got the money
B	when I've got a job
A	it's it's easier isn't it?
B	but it's just amazing that she was able to do that for me
A	well at least
B	so that's nice
A	you know where your next meal's coming from
B	exactly
A	you don't have to steal sandwiches
B	bloody hell
A	that's I'm sorry
B	I know isn't it so funny?
A	I know
B	it's so funny but that's what you do isn't it to set yourself up somewhere like
A	yeah
B	the things that you do
A	like I don't know
B	in order to do it
A	what I'd do without my parents because they are they are sub subbing me all the way at the moment
B	mm
A	like I've got these little part time jobs and I'm occasionally doing a race or something but
B	yeah
A	I mean it's not really er a regular income
B	yeah
A	train tickets or
B	yeah that's what I'm doing with
A	mm
B	whenever they want me to do something like a day a day of fundraising if they're out
A	yeah
B	I will cover them and they will pay me for it which is nice
B	yeah
A	yeah I applied for a job with erm
B	oh yeah?
A	a
B	fifty what?
A	fifth or the sixth of March
B	oh
A	so a lot of them I was never gonna hear back until you know the beginning of March er anyway and erm so I'm just kind of like
B	did you write
A	yeah
B	because that's what I found I was applying for so many
A	and forgetting what they were yeah
B	that I just forgot about all er like I just didn't have a I probably I probably applied to one like a few more than once
A	did you?
B	oh no I
A	yeah were you signed up to job sites with and stuff?
B	yeah like
A	yeah I'm on that one Reed?
B	Reed?
A	R E E D Reed dot co dot UK?
B	maybe
A	that's quite a good one
B	there was another one and then there was Charity Jobs that was a big one Charity Jobs
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and what it is
B	you'll be good you'll be fine
A	yeah I mean one of them has to be successful
B	yeah
A	I've been doing about nine a week on average that kind of
B	that's really good
A	in that kind of region
B	that's perfect
A	yeah so I'll see what happens with that
B	and you'll just
A	this week I've decided to take a bit of a break because I've started getting all these calls and I was like overwhelmed and I was like okay I'm gonna stop for a bit
B	did you get calls? saying what?
A	calls and emails like asking for interviews and stuff
B	oh yeah
A	like that I'm arranging all this week and I was like right I should
B	yeah
A	and then start again if I don't hear back
B	batches
A	yeah
B	and then you won't know what to choose
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it is exciting and it's good that
A	some of them want me
B	yeah
A	oh no I'd I'd commute and then
B	yeah
A	like I could commute at first or stay with my uncle depending on whether it's close to him or not but
B	oh exciting erm
A	what did she say?
B	she was saying cos she said when does your rent terminate?
A	mm
B	oh cos
A	yes I am
B	we're yes
A	she's right about that
B	yes
A	yeah
B	I know how funny would that be?
A	and if
B	that's what I said as well I said yeah
A	yeah
A	okay
B	and wanting to live in London
A	yeah
B	but she you never know what
B	in order to gain money to come back again
A	to come to London yeah
B	she probably will do that so but also it would be slap bang in the middle of my dissertation
A	yeah
B	like period
A	and that's more important you need to get that out the way first
B	and I don't know what what what's going on with this moving to Paris thing in two thousand and sixteen
A	well yeah
B	so but I want to do it it's something
A	mm
B	I really want to do
A	well what's what's where is she?
A	with her dad? with her dad?
B	so yeah with her dad
A	yeah
B	I don't know where that is though
A	yeah my my uncle
B	yeah
A	really close
B	mine's south
A	yeah
B	I'm in zone three
A	yeah like you're

B	I love being back in you you're you're in
A	I know
B	you're in the loop now
A	we should meet up more
B	you be in the loop
A	yes I hate being out of the loop it's
B	I hate being out of the loop too
A	it was it was so hard being in Peru and everyone was like in the loop and I like
B	oh
A	across the world
B	do you know what?
A	there was no loop to be part of
B	there wasn't really a loop there really wasn't me and
A	mm
B	so if you are living together then
A	yeah because I definitely wouldn't
B	you'd see each other in the evening
A	wouldn't be able to afford to
B	yeah
A	so preferably I would like to live with friends rather than just
B	yeah
A	you know go and flat share with people I don't know
B	yeah well if you can why not?
A	yeah
B	you can I did a Gumtree looking for a flat er a house and I ended up moving into a er like a newly
A	oh

A	oh that's good
B	really
A	ah
B	and chats and like
A	it sounds so cool
B	it was such a nice house I think we were really lucky cos sometimes when you move into a house with a bunch of new people
A	yeah that's the risk isn't it? that's what I want to avoid
B	yeah but some of the like they've
A	oh
B	Australian guy who moved here was a really really sweet guy actually but he was a filmer so he liked
A	okay so they just moved one day?
B	decided that they'd do the same yeah
A	so what how where did they live for the first few days when they were looking for a house?
B	er in hostels
A	oh god
B	and then they found the house and they were in before anyone else cos they were they were there when it was all being built
A	yeah
B	in this bomb like in this building site

B	I know so they said yeah we've got we've got a hostel booked for two weeks and then we're just gonna find a house and find jobs
A	wow
B	so they've gone over there
A	it's

A	doesn't sound like they have any money worries
B	no

A	yeah
B	that sort of
A	that's fine I just
B	if needs must
A	I thought you might say oh I live right next to
