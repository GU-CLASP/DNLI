A	so how come you're back so early? I thought you had a tennis lesson
B	oh well so did I
B	and having made the arrangement with
A	oh no
B	but had obviously not bothered to write it down
A	so he'd just completely forgotten you?
B	yes
B	no I didn't
A	what he just happened to be free?
B	yes
B	and said and who forgot twelve o'clock today?
B	he did  he did he did
A	was it suitably grovelling?
B	yes
B	yes
B	huh
B	um
B	I was tempted to say well you can give me a free lesson
B	but I thought no that's that's a bit much
B	um
A	mhm
B	at twelve o'clock
B	and so I sent back well you do have a track record
B	he's done it
A	aw
B	oh yes I will
B	and the last time he did it to
B	and he got a roasting from both of us
B	the following week
A	was he
B	not not only that but I bought him a little notebook
B	to put in his bag
B	has he used it?
A	well that's the thing
B	mm
A	to do things like keep appointments
B	mhm
A	and stuff
B	mm
A	I for for example I much prefer to write something down
B	mm
A	than to  than to  put it in my phone
B	mm
A	you have to press
B	mhm
A	enter duddle uddle er
B	well thinking back
A	the diary or
B	when we were talking about it last Tuesday
A	hm
B	now whether this course came up since he did that
B	but er no I I'll make him pay on Wednesday
B	I'll make him pay
B	but Tom's very nice
B	very young
B	which was very nice of him
A	do you find tennis to be a good workout? Because whenever I've
B	oo yes
A	whenever I've played tennis I don't actually find it to be that
B	if you're playing a game
A	hm
B	Cos you've got to cover the whole of the court
A	so maybe I
B	out of breath
A	maybe I just wasn't doing it right
B	no doubles when we play doubles at the end of the Monday night it's not
A	hm
B	um
A	hm
B	so no the the the lessons themselves are a good workout
A	and what about the aqua aerobics? Is that a good workout?
B	it depends
A	hm
B	um
A	mhm
B	and so many people are up way out of the water so their arms are half in the water instead of right down
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you get
B	and it's so you can make it as easy or as hard as you like
A	mm
B	depending on how cold the water is
A	oo
A	Brr
B	and lately they've had trouble with the boiler
A	oh dear
B	yep
A	is the spa pool usually hot?
B	mm
B	just go and sit in it and it bubbles
B	mm
A	but aqua aerobics are you supposed to be I mean you
B	oh yes
A	I imagine
B	yeah
A	on the
B	mm
A	bottom of the swimming pool
B	mm
A	mm
B	except that you're using the water as resistance instead of using weights and things like that
A	mm
B	but it certainly is a good workout
A	no I'd do it if it was er in the Mediterranean
A	and warm and sunny
B	yes
A	one of my friends has got a free two week pass to the LA Fitness in Kings Heath
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
B	well you're best off keeping it I don't know whether they have a a a system where you can see how difficult the class is
A	I don't know
B	it's colour
A	right
B	you would be better to pick something on a fairly low level to start with to see what it's like
A	yep
B	Cos there's no point in going in one of the hard ones and then being put off completely
A	hm
B	they all have boom boom boom music
A	oh no
B	even the aqua aerobics
A	oh you're joking
B	no I'm not
A	and do you find that actually motivates you? Doesn't it just
B	it's better than doing it without the music
A	yeah?
B	and the music that
A	mhm
B	and we can sing along
B	and we all know the words
A	oh really?
B	oh yeah
A	oh so she hasn't got
B	there is some
B	but it's it is better with the music I have to say
A	yeah
B	definitely
A	no I mean I love music
B	mm
A	house music
B	the annoying thing is that there is a spin class going on upstairs at the same time
A	and you can hear that?
B	mm huh the woman who takes it she's got um a microphone on
A	uh-huh
B	and it's so load
A	yeah
B	you can hear her above everything else
B	mm
A	in Murcia? And yeah the woman who was doing it had like a a mouthpiece
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	barked orders
B	yes
A	at us over the top of the boom boom boom music
B	yeah
A	and but the
B	ff
A	and er all evening
B	you've got that
A	it was okay one two three to the side
B	oh
A	duddle er
B	oh
A	to the left
B	God
A	duddle er
B	oh
B	oh
B	how awful
A	the people who were immediately above that gym
B	mm
A	must have been tearing their hair out
B	yep
A	then again the Spanish people are more
B	true
A	tolerant to noise
B	it would be worth you going in to see um what sort of classes they've got on offer
A	yep
B	is usually very quiet
A	yep
B	you wouldn't would you?
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	doesn't everyone look silly
B	yes
A	I looked at myself in the mirror
B	no
A	and I just thought oh my life I look so stupid
B	yep
A	I'm never coming back to this class again
B	yep
A	and I was like oh it's alright
B	yeah
A	they all look stupid
B	they all look silly yeah
A	yeah
B	my body doesn't do that
A	yeah I know
B	it was so funny
A	and also it's so fast paced
B	yes
A	that once you've mastered one particular step that they're doing at that time
B	mm
A	they've moved onto the next one
B	that's right
A	but I do think the more you go the easier it is because
B	well the
A	yep
B	you know it's like line dancing
A	it does seem to be the same
B	anything like that
A	every week
B	no that's right
A	yeah
B	see er there was one that goes on this morning at David Lloyd
A	mhm
B	but I don't know what else they do because I don't do any of the other classes
A	well already with your three tennis lessons
B	no oh no not three
A	personal training
B	not three
A	two tennis lessons
B	two personal training and two aqua aerobics
A	yeah
B	which is a bit of a nuisance
A	well that's not bad
B	mm
A	really?
B	no
A	oh right
B	mm
A	how did you notice that made a difference?
B	I don't get I didn't get so out of breath tennis and things like that
A	oh really?
B	mm
B	it just
A	maybe you  maybe you  go all silly because your body needs oxygen
A	and your body's way of getting oxygen is by laughing and huh ha ha ha ha ha ha huh ha ha ha
B	yes
B	well I can just we'll be playing and be doing a rally
B	and I can't do anything
A	mm
B	yep
A	is that the tennis?
B	mhm
A	oh
A	no
A	it's nap time obviously
B	yep
A	oh it does knacker me though I
B	oh yes
A	concentration
B	concentration
A	he said to me while I was driving just getting ready to turn left er at a junction he said so what are you planning  what are you planning  for the rest of the day? And I was like rest of the day? What? Uh? Okay wait there sorry I've just I'm concentrating
A	so hard on everything that I I haven't got space in my mind to think about the rest of the day at the moment sorry
B	no you'll get used to that
A	yes
B	it's there's so many things to think about and to do in a
B	it's very easy to get things in the wrong order to start with
A	yes
B	but no as I say remember it's only your second lesson so
A	no it's true
B	yeah
A	it's
B	you'll be fine
A	he is kind of I
B	in which case
A	to new things
B	yeah
A	and
B	say that to him
A	but the  but the  thing is I also want to you see I don't know whether huh it's probably cos I'm just not getting practice
B	mm
A	and then give me feedback
B	mhm
A	and then
B	well say that to him
A	mm
B	that's the most important part
A	mm
B	to do it the way in which you feel more comfortable
B	how you feel more comfortable then tell him
A	it's probably actually not a very good thing for me to learn how to drive
A	in a vacuum without other cars around is it
B	mm
A	and you get used to
B	it it's true
A	I know but tomorrow he wants us going up the
B	right
B	I was just going to say I don't think he'd make
A	forty miles an hour in fourth gear he said
B	yep
A	Down the
B	yes
B	sixty miles an hour down the
B	he'll probably take you to
A	mm
B	turn left
A	mm
B	and that's perfectly straight
A	mm
B	er it's two two lanes of traffic
A	mm
B	most people are
A	yes
B	no no no
A	if I was a driver like was it you yesterday? I hate it when people do that
B	yeah
A	pull out when you're signalling for them to pull out
B	it's it's that they don't look
A	yeah
B	that's what annoys me
B	but
A	what drives me round the bend is people who don't signal
B	yes
A	hm
B	if subsequently they turn off that's fine
A	yes I know
B	oh yes you do
A	no no no but I I'm thinking about so many things at once
B	yes you're thinking about them now
A	oh that's good
B	it'll come automatically
A	the clutch thing kinda comes
B	mm
A	quite naturally now
B	mm
A	but not changing gears
B	well that's something you just learn by experience
A	mm
B	but say I used to tell grandad by the sound of the engine when he was going to change gear
A	yeah
B	so again you'll find that'll come
A	uh-huh
B	with time
A	not if you're not happy doing that
B	oh I it's I'm it's not so I'm not happy about you going out practising
A	oh gosh no
A	I'd never do that
B	you're not having my car
A	it's your car
B	you wouldn't manage you father's car anyway
A	hm
B	I think you'll find that's just too big
A	Don't think I'd manage my father either
B	huh
B	and not say anything
B	um but I'm not sure that I would be much better
A	oh no I think you would be
B	no
A	roads
B	have a
A	without a
B	no
A	dual control
B	have another few lessons before you even think about that
A	or
B	you've got to get used to it
A	or what I'd maybe like to do with you would be to go to the old
B	what does?
A	what I'm doing wrong
B	what does he tell you to do?
A	I don't know mum
B	mm
A	reacting to his instructions
B	mm
A	to keep
B	mm
A	myself alive
B	no no that's you will find that that becomes almost automatic after a while
A	hm
B	it it's really very simple
A	uh-huh
B	actions every single time
A	hm
A	stop
B	yeah
A	right
B	automatic cars are fine
A	I know
B	gearbox
A	but why aren't all cars just automatic? Why because dad said what was it he said the last time? Oh I know but you'll you'll learn to appreciate a manual gearbox
B	pardon?
A	it just complicates everything
B	well it yes it does
B	because automatically I went to change gear and I kept hitting the brake
A	oh it's
B	not a good idea
A	pedals?
B	yeah
A	accelerator and brake?
B	mhm
A	you see that's all you need
A	left and right
A	it's a lot easier
A	flicking I tell you what I keep doing
B	mhm
A	on the left
B	oh dear
A	uh-huh
B	and you're not insured for that
A	okay
B	so that there wasn't anything er likely to
A	hm
B	drove around the perimeter track and
A	you don't know anyone who works at Silverstone do you?
B	no
A	I do like going fast
B	yeah
A	I also it's also natural for me for some reason
B	mm
A	with a right-hand turn that is a T-junction
B	mhm
A	onto another road where it's
B	across the flow of traffic?
A	yeah
B	yep
A	and if it's clear and everything you kinda nearly come to a halt
B	mm
A	but if it's clear you carry on
B	mhm
A	and then I turn and my foot automatically hits the
A	hits the accelerator
B	right
A	Don't accelerate into a turn
A	or is that?
B	well you don't well yes you do have to accelerate but you should aim for a nice steady
A	oh it's steady
B	slow er
A	I just like I just take it fast
B	mm
A	in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you'll be fine
A	yeah I know I will  I will I will  It's just
B	you'll be fine
A	it's not it's that it's daunting it's you know you get to that point where
B	mm
A	or you get  you get  shown a lot and then you think oh my gosh I'm gonna have to start doing this off my own back
B	mm
A	and I have just got no clue
B	yes you will
A	and as I said because he's giving feeding me all these instructions all the time
B	mm
A	where's the
A	how do you indicate right?
B	mm
A	mm
B	Cos once you've done that it then becomes just automatic
A	yep
B	then you don't even think about it
A	hm
B	and even now sometimes um going from where are we? Second to third I sometimes overcook it and go straight to fifth
A	on purpose?
B	no
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I'm fine changing from first into second
B	mm
A	second into first and neutral
B	mm
A	but I was either going into first or fifth
B	mm
A	instead of third
B	mm
A	Cos the notch just didn't seem like it was
B	mm
A	there
B	no you just have to learn where it is
A	is it generally the same in every car?
B	mhm
A	no
B	is the same pattern
A	but the amount not the pattern like
B	no no no no
A	the distance between
B	no
A	mm
B	most of the time
A	yes
B	very interesting to watch people changing gear
A	mm
B	to see how they do it
A	looks very camp
B	very fancy
A	duddle uddle er duddle
B	no you'll you'll find it
A	yes
B	and strangely enough if I have to think about the gearbox and where everything is that's really hard
A	really?
B	yeah
A	well that's like when you're trying to remember a phone number
B	mm
A	remember when you
B	no idea
A	or have I just
B	I guess
A	because I get on my mobile I get free minutes
B	ah
A	but I've got a feeling that that's only to mobile numbers
B	right
A	wait there
A	potatoes
B	I thought I could
A	yes those were my potatoes and I they had burnt er boiled dry
A	slightly burnt
B	were they
A	just sautéd
B	edible?
A	oh I haven't eaten them yet
B	oh right
A	I've put them in the fridge cos um I'm gonna have I'm gonna put some er salad cream on them and have a bit of potato salad
B	mhm
A	with the chicken
B	mm
A	I didn't particularly want to have hot potatoes
B	no
A	but I was oh I should've done some for dad
B	no he'll he won't want them
A	is he not gonna have chicken when he comes home?
B	he'll probably have chicken but he'll probably have just a sandwich
A	ah
B	potato salad
A	what time is he home? Or?
B	depends entirely on the traffic
A	ah
B	and apparently there is fog at some stage between Poole and somewhere else
A	fog at this time of day?
B	mm
A	why would that be?
B	depends on the um oo I heard that
A	mm
B	um you often get fog and it can linger for quite a long time
A	mm
B	and it's been beautiful in Poole
A	really?
B	and sometimes it takes him ages to get through and sometimes it doesn't
A	what time was he leaving?
B	um think it was about two
A	hm
B	but it was a Sunday
A	ah
B	and he had a clear run through
A	yep
B	yep
A	all the organizations that I've looked at the webpages for they're like um we do not recommend for you to drive to our offices
B	no
A	you get the park and ride
B	yes
A	there is no parking in Oxford
B	mm
A	and
B	no park and ride is a very good scheme
A	mm
B	lets you park outside the city and just shuttle bus you in
A	mhm
B	as well
A	yep
B	so you can do the Warwick park and ride as well
A	yeah
B	I don't think they've got it for Birmingham
A	mm
B	mind you I think Birmingham's got a lot more car parking provision
A	yep
B	the city centre
B	Bath is an absolute nightmare
A	I think places like that aren't actually built for traffic
B	oh no
A	like places like Birmingham have been
B	mm
A	developed so much since
B	yeah well
A	the advent of the motorcar
B	yep
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that it is very walkable
B	mm
A	and the roads aren't too wide and
B	there's some very nice buildings
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure huh I think well I don't know cos it's a long time since I went to Cambridge to look round
A	for driving? Or in general?
B	no no
A	hm
B	but I'm not sure how it's changed
A	why did you prefer?
B	it was it seemed to me to be smaller
A	really?
B	mm
A	mm
B	but lovely buildings
A	I think pause
B	try and fix up for next week going to the French pâtisserie
A	okay
B	Monday would be a good day for me
A	I was just thinking I haven't booked my driving lessons for next week
B	you can do that tomorrow
A	mm
B	but that would seem
A	mm
B	ah right
A	so I'm not sure if next Monday
B	okay
A	I'm gonna be doing the spreadsheet that we've got to do
B	right
A	um what other plans have you got over the week?
B	well I suspect Tuesday and Wednesday will be
A	but that's only that's morning
B	that's an hour
A	and what time does he normally come?
B	and tennis is Tuesday
A	what time does
B	um either nine or half past
A	but if you wanna go there for lunch that doesn't
B	well no
A	rule out
B	no I'd rather go for coffee
A	oh would you?
B	coffee and naughty cakes
A	okay
B	just don't tell
B	um if he comes it'll be either nine or nine thirty Tuesday
A	so what kind of time?
B	but Wednesday
A	okay if you say you wanna go for a coffee
B	mhm
A	what kind of time are you thinking of wanting to go then?
B	mm somewhere around eleven
A	oh right
B	would that fit?
A	yeah
B	Wednesday actually would be the best time to do that then
A	mhm
B	Don't
A	but you'll get paid for it as if it were holiday?
B	oh yeah
A	um
B	mhm
A	um
B	have a think about it and let me know
A	well I'll see when
B	yeah
A	he's free for driving lessons
B	yeah
A	Cos it might actually
B	mm
A	okay
B	and then Wednesday after
A	so Monday or Wednesday
B	Monday or Wednesday would be the safest cos I know I'm working this Friday
A	mhm
B	Saturday's busy
A	traffic?
B	yeah
A	I think the farmers' market's on as well this Saturday
B	mm
A	which will be difficult
B	should be busier
A	then again
B	no
A	you might like to see that
B	makes more sense to do it during the week when it's quieter isn't it
A	okay
B	I think that would
A	no problem
B	and I'll defy
A	who's
B	the dietitian
A	oh of course
A	is this the new God of your new-found religion or something?
B	no
B	thank you
B	no she's going to have words with her professors to see if they have any other suggestions
A	what what would she be talking about to her professors? I mean what
B	to see if they've got any other ideas
A	so what has she done so far? Just excluded certain things?
B	we've been doing exclusion diets
A	hm
B	we'll just have to see what she comes up with
A	but nothing at all has helped?
B	nope
B	I've no idea
A	I gave her number to Indy by the way
B	oh good
A	yeah
B	mm
A	seeing you said don't phone her
B	well it's not that I sort of think that phoning her is probably the least secure way of getting in touch with her
A	well she's probably in
B	but when I did leave a message on her
A	okay
B	I think I've got another two weeks
A	after this one?
B	after last week I think I've got this week and another week
A	oh right
B	nope
B	I do not
B	it's
A	well I'll wait until driving instructor
B	mm
A	gives me his availability
B	mm
A	for next week and
B	sort it
A	is Dad away again next week?
B	um not as far as I know at the moment
A	is he working in Ireland at all?
B	no
A	where are they again?
B	Bahamas
A	oo la la
B	for two months
A	how very nice
B	I know
A	why have they got friends out there or something?
B	no
A	uh-huh
B	and the weather in Ireland this time of the
A	well if you've got the time and the money why not?
B	well the problem is they have the time but they're rapidly not having the money
A	well that'll teach them for spending too much
B	I don't think it will unfortunately
A	isn't Diane coming into a lot of money for the land in Scotland?
B	well eventually
A	well I don't think surviving's the word if they're jetting off to the Bahamas for two months
B	no
A	blimey
B	mhm
A	stupid man
B	mhm
A	um so where are they staying? Are they staying at a hotel? Or did they have an apartment?
B	I think it's an
A	mm
B	not absolutely sure
A	but I bet you he won't be enjoying it
B	pff
A	like I would for example
B	does does he ever appreciate anything? He's although I must admit I've spoken to him a couple of times and have said are you having a good time? Oh yes
A	oh that's good
B	who knows with
A	so why does dad have to go to Ireland before?
B	there he wants him to look at various things
A	uh-huh
B	and it's going to be more difficult for somebody just to walk in and pick up the pieces
A	what are they going to be paying him? Freelance?
B	I assume
A	oh he's going to have to make a million pounds last two years
B	which will be very difficult for
A	poor thing
B	would you
A	then again I imagine the house in Ireland costs a lot to
B	oh huh
A	upkeep
B	why on earth they bought something that size I shall never know
A	yep
B	well hallelujah
A	mm
B	I mean Badgeworth was the same
A	well
B	hasn't got now
B	too bloody right
B	well no you don't
A	at which funeral?
A	why did
B	because they
A	really?
B	yes
A	oh
B	um
A	mm
B	he said yes he said he went to shake my hand and I said oh hello
B	and I was delighted to see that he's gone grey
B	he's got fat
A	oh you
B	looks an absolute frump
A	oh mum
B	well she thinks the sun shines out of his backside
A	mm
B	but I just don't understand
A	mm
B	and she's changed so much
B	they looked as though they'd just come in from the garden
B	oh
A	has he retired now?
A	that was a very evil laugh
B	yep
A	hm
B	and then he did some work for somebody or other
A	hmm
B	well he er expected to get pick up work at the drop of a hat from various people um but I think his reputation was such that nobody wanted to touch him with a barge-pole
A	well I'm not surprised
B	no
A	you can't go round treating people like that all your
B	mm
A	life and then expect to
B	no
A	but what was the dynamic there? He was on the board of directors at
B	he was
A	firm?
B	he was chairman
A	oh okay
B	and company solicitor
A	okay
B	but I think he cos say once the shit hit the fan at
A	and what was
B	oh he he's perfectly happy about it
A	hm
B	and he said actually it gives him much more satisfaction being in
A	mhm
B	where
B	he finds that um
A	did he?
B	poetic justice
A	did he actually chat to
B	very briefly
A	did he mention? Did he slip in that he was oh just off to Ireland I'll see you
B	something was said about
A	oh so he knows that dad's working for them
B	oh yes
A	mm
B	he's known all along
A	hm
B	but then there's the dreaded
A	was he there as well?
B	no
A	oh
B	no
B	mhm
A	ah so that was quite amicable? The whole
B	oh I'm not sure it was amicable
A	why not?
B	well
B	no he's an objectionable individual
A	it's not particularly a way a good way to win friends and influence people
B	no well he hasn't done terribly well
A	hm
B	um
A	does he live around here?
B	no
A	well round here
B	oh yeah
B	thank God
B	thank God
A	and so on the subject of funerals
B	funeral is at half past one at Robin Hood
A	mhm
B	so
A	and are all your family going to be there?
A	is
B	no no no
A	how come?
B	well that's grandad's side
A	oh okay
B	the dreaded
A	are there
A	is that
B	oh my cousin
A	is that the son of the
B	it's
A	but is that the son of the guy who died?
B	no
A	how is he
B	he's my cousin
A	okay
B	he's a cousin
A	of they're cousins
B	mm
A	okay
B	we're all cousins
A	ah
B	children
A	mhm
A	hm
B	I imagine
A	oh dear
B	mm
B	I'd be interested to see if
A	mm
B	is funerals and significant birthday parties
A	oh well that's happier
B	it's happier but they come infrequently
A	well nanny's ninetieth
B	mm
A	was a good party
B	mm
A	wasn't it
B	yep
B	mhm
A	afterwards
B	yep
A	no that was nice
B	mm
A	seeing everybody
B	well you were oh I think you remember
A	yeah
B	that was
A	no you were looking at the Bibles
B	yeah
A	the old Welsh Bibles
B	mm
A	yeah no nanny showed me
B	mm
A	the photos that she
B	mm
A	that she had that we had
B	nice
A	developed from her birthday party
B	mm
A	to show me which one it was
A	which one is
B	no
A	quite an attractive lady?
B	mm
A	there's a photo of you and her or nanny and her at nanny's ninetieth
B	I've no idea
A	in that case I
B	it's not her
A	don't know which one it is
A	I can't keep up with all these
B	mm
A	aunts and uncles and
B	Cousins and wives and
B	how many what?
A	brothers and sisters
B	two brothers and three sisters
A	so he was one of six
B	mm
A	and nanny was one of?
B	Seven
A	Seven
B	she had one sister and all the others were brothers
B	it's amazing to think that by the time she was born her eldest brother had left home
A	hm
B	was out at work and had left home
B	that's virtually twenty years
A	blimey
B	mm
A	she must've been a baby-making
A	why did she have so many?
B	because in those days you did
A	mm
B	contraception wasn't as available
A	yeah but surely I mean how did people afford to have eight kids?
B	because things weren't as expensive
A	hm
B	and also I suppose when they got married which was nineteen O one I think it was um there was quite a considerable infant mortality rate
A	mm
B	but things were very different
A	what's a harmonium?
B	it's like an organ little organ
A	ah
B	pedal
A	ah
B	I can remember that
B	um
A	did you used to play parlour games?
B	I was trying to think
A	oh I think I'd much prefer a lifestyle like that than one of
B	hm
A	today where people are pushed to become
B	mm
A	little consumerists
B	yes
A	your nanny or my nanny?
B	my nanny
A	oh obviously your nanny
B	six kids to bring up and she didn't know where he was
A	how long
B	oh that we don't know
A	how old was nanny when that happened?
B	no grandad
A	oh how old was grandad when that happened?
B	um
B	went up I think it was Leeds
A	I bet that spoke volumes
B	yeah
B	yes
A	and what had he been doing  what had had he been doing?
B	he'd been working
A	oh right
B	he found a job
A	uh-huh
B	um
B	she wasn't as tall as me
B	er but you didn't cross her
B	she was something else
A	but how come he just upped and left and not contacted?
B	I have no idea
A	it was hardly the done thing
B	no but he was a bit of a law unto himself was grandad
A	mhm
B	he he'd got a terrible temper as well
A	really?
B	oo terrible temper
A	what worse than my dad when er I used to read the Reader's Digest before him?
B	oh ff
A	huh
B	yes
A	Good on her
B	yes
A	had the cat actually instigated the bad behaviour
B	no
A	the bad
B	no
A	oh
B	foul mood over something
A	oh right
B	but er I always got on very well with my grandad
B	coming back from work
A	where was this?
B	in
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	uh-huh
B	and there were three big trees and he'd hide behind one of them and it was a ritual
B	and get his Woodbines
B	can't sell fags to kids
B	but no it was er
A	so what did he er what did he work in when he was?
B	he was a tool-maker
A	A what?
B	tool-maker
A	oh right
B	mhm
A	my grandad or your grandad?
B	your grandad
A	okay
B	er
A	mhm
B	and I think he lasted two weeks
A	why?
B	because he couldn't stand it
B	it was just not him at all
A	mm
B	so he progressed up the the ladder
A	oh he'd
B	would take his spare false eye stick it on the thing
B	oh he were a case
A	so what he was in charge of all the
B	yes
A	all
B	the whole tool-room and all the people working in it
A	hm
B	on the presses and the various machines
A	and what did they make? During during the war I mean sorry
B	ah during the war I'm not sure exactly what they they were making during the war
A	uh-huh
B	they made those
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	what they were the ones that
B	mm
A	originally made them?
B	mm
A	really?
B	mhm
A	what they they had the patent for them and everything?
B	oh no I don't think they had the patent for them
A	oh
B	mm
A	oh that's interesting
B	mm
A	and did they make arms or tools during the war?
B	I have no idea
A	hm
B	no I I couldn't tell you exactly what they were making
A	mm
B	but that's partly the reason why he wasn't in the forces during the war
A	ah
B	engineers
A	okay
B	and the fact he'd lost an eye
A	and was your grandfather in the First World War?
B	not as far as I know
A	Cos he was in the same occupation? Or?
B	I don't know
A	or he
B	my other grandfather nanny's father was in the First World War
A	really?
B	yes but he was non-combatant
A	what did he do?
B	his of his health and things
A	uh-huh
B	bent
A	didn't he draw some propaganda posters and stuff?
B	mm doing all sorts of
A	cartoons
B	things like that
B	I think he was just a clerk
A	oh
B	or a draughtsman
A	what is a draughtsman?
B	um drawing up plans for things
A	ah
B	draughtsman makes plans for machines
A	oh okay
B	bits of parts of things
A	interesting
B	mm
A	very interesting
B	but nanny's oldest brother was reserved occupation
A	why? What was he?
B	Cos he was engineering as well
A	hm
B	um uncle
A	really?
B	mm
A	the concentration camp?
B	mhm
A	oh dear
B	he would never talk about it
A	I'm not surprised
B	he had nightmares
A	mm
B	for years after
A	tut
B	but would never talk about it
A	gosh
B	dunno
A	were you born after?
B	mhm
A	mhm
B	they'd just dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
A	and then they dropped the Wendy bomb
B	the biggest bombshell of the lot
B	but grandad's oldest brother joined the merchant navy
A	what was his name?
A	mhm
A	oh yeah
B	um
A	mm
B	but then I suppose it's not that surprising because of the area
A	why's that? Cos it was heavily industrialized?
B	yeah
A	I'm surprised how diverse a like there are so many different types of engineering
B	mm
A	I didn't realize
B	mm
A	what's that?
B	the um they manufactured cycles and motorcycles
A	mm
B	which was an engineering company
A	but what kind of engineering did they do?
B	I have no idea
A	oh this is the father of your cousin
B	mm
A	that whose funeral
B	mm
A	it is tomorrow
B	it was
B	not putting himself in any sort of risk at all
A	it's a surely that's a human instinct?
B	yeah but when your country's at war and fighting for survival one expects
A	no I don't think you'd get that anymore
B	oh I'm not sure
A	in this day and age
B	not sure  not sure  Wouldn't like to say
A	well I think the only people that would stand up and say fight for Britain would be the BNP lot
A	then again BNP and EDL
B	mm
A	no I doubt  I doubt  that
B	I
A	I don't think they would be able then again nowadays warfare doesn't involve bodies does it
A	okay yeah
B	it's a much more even mix now than it ever was
A	but I doubt they'd have to
B	they would
A	would they?
B	our army is so small
A	really?
B	oh yeah
A	hm
B	there would have to be massive conscription
A	well
B	chopped and chopped  and chopped  We have no aircraft carriers anymore
A	yeah but nowadays with a war it would just be one nuclear bomb
B	no no no no no
A	hm
B	I think it's nuclear weapons are a lot of sabre-rattling
A	well there are plenty of them out there
B	there are
B	there are
A	was that before Pearl Harbour? What was that one?
B	oh no no no
A	oh sorry I didn't hear you
B	yeah
A	ah was that er Nixon and?
B	no that was Kennedy
B	yes it was er it went very close to the wire
A	I'm sure I've seen a film huh about that
B	possibly
A	what
B	Watergate
A	a film called Nixon I
B	Watergate
A	that's right
B	yes there was a film about Watergate
A	but there was a a I'm sure there was a film about the Bay of Pigs as well
B	possibly
A	um what why what are you doing? What are you
B	I'm just wondering
A	what plans have you got?
B	what time do you want to I can give you a lift into
A	aw
B	no well I wouldn't have offered if I hadn't wanted to would I?
A	bless you
B	I'm just waiting
A	yeah I know
B	sitting there with her paw
B	she's so funny
B	aw
A	look how much
B	yeah I know
A	I've got off her just from brushing her once
B	yeah
A	I
B	yes
A	I'm sure you wouldn't
B	yes but you've still got to spin it out
A	couldn't you just? Cos the
B	no dear
A	the way these come off
B	yes I know but
A	tut
B	you still couldn't do it like that
A	let me speak
A	the way these come off surely you could just they come off as rectangles could you not just sew them together?
B	no they they wouldn't hold together
A	oh well I guess these bits of fur are reserved for the birds in the garden anyway
B	yes
A	to make their nests with
B	yes
A	yeah
B	needs a proper spinning wheel
B	who's that?
B	oh was it?
A	yeah with his dog
B	with the dog
B	aw
A	yay
B	I'm not quite sure
A	do the birds still feed off the feeders?
B	mhm
A	I wonder whether we'll see the hedgehogs
A	this year
B	I doubt it
B	what's the matter?
A	she wants to be brushed again
B	are you talking to me?
A	I want a cardigan
A	come here
B	soppy girl
A	but this actually doesn't weave very well into wool
B	well it does
A	how are you supposed to do it?
B	you pull it and twist it at the same time
A	go on you do it
B	hm
A	do you have machines that that do that?
B	well the spinning wheel used to be what you used
A	and how do you?
B	the old spinning wheel
A	but how do you put that hair onto a spinning wheel?
B	hm
A	do you have to feed it in?
B	the yes virtually
A	ah
B	cunning
A	and that was made with er sheep's wool?
B	yep
A	and what consistency is sheep's wool? What is it similar to cat hair?
B	no
B	aw
B	is that nice? Aw is that lovely?
A	crazy cat
B	aw
A	now look how much has come off just
B	I know
A	from brushing
B	I know
B	oh yes
A	moult for summer?
B	huh
A	look at that
B	I know
A	hair
B	yep
A	oh
B	the under fur out
A	okay
B	because her fur the top coat is longer and coarser and the undercoat is much finer
A	but it's such soft hair
B	mm
A	oh my gosh look at all the stuff on the carpet
B	I know
A	cat
B	stuff on the carpet
A	come here
B	no
A	I bet nobody's got cat hair cardigan
A	maybe it'd be like mohair
A	she could wear a scarf of her own fluff
B	there you are
A	are you going to work on the garden this spring?
B	who knows
A	why's that?
B	I dunno
A	aw
B	aw
A	I've never seen a cat like
B	aw
A	being brushed so much
B	aw
A	aren't you ever going
B	aw
A	are you even going to put in the dahlias this year?
B	I don't know
A	why are they supposed to?
B	Cos they often do
A	have you got lots of things in the garden that do just come up every year?
B	most of the things in the garden just
A	well there you go
B	because
A	that's good
B	no I don't like having to plant things every year
A	there's so much
B	oh dear
A	I know
B	oh
A	and when does it start getting light past seven PM?
B	well it's getting that way now but it will be even more noticeable when we change the clocks
A	that's next week no? Gosh it doesn't seem long since we turned the clocks forward
B	well that's October isn't it
A	did we put them back or forward? Er spring forward
B	spring forwards
A	fall back
B	yes
A	so
B	oh here you are
A	they'll go forward
B	Sunday the twenty-fifth
A	so not this Sunday but next Sunday
B	mhm
A	british Summer Time
A	so it was really six months ago since we put the clocks?
B	mm
A	that's gone so quickly
B	mm
A	Cos I remember I was going out at six fifty was it?
B	something like that
A	and it had just got to the point where I was going out in the morning and it was just getting light
B	mm
A	and then we put the clocks
B	back
A	fall back we put the clocks back
B	mm
A	put up with another
B	well it's getting noticeably much lighter earlier in the mornings now
A	mm
B	it's definitely lighter in the mornings
A	and were they not talking about abolishing the
B	oh they've been talking about this for years
A	is that what the logic is?
B	I don't know what the logic is
A	why don't people just get up an hour earlier? Instead of
B	that would be far too logical a solution
B	wouldn't it
A	well it just seems a bit it's like as if they're purporting that it's creating more hours of sunlight
B	no it's not
A	hm
B	so
A	no that is one of the nice things about England
A	very warm in the summer and you can never tell whether it's going to be raining or cloudy or
B	mm
A	what not at least it stays light
B	mm
A	a long time
B	no
A	stay so light
B	no
A	for so long
B	and also I mean we'll find this when we go to Greece
A	yep
B	um
A	you should just learn to lie in
B	can't do that
B	can't do that
A	you don't read books much anymore
B	Cos it's too uncomfortable
A	tut
B	I find it really uncomfortable
A	yeah
B	Cos it's just not comfortable at all
A	hm
B	and actually reading sitting I have to be very careful where the book is and
A	have you tried dad's Kindle?
B	yes
A	and how's that? Is that better?
B	the same
A	hm
B	it is the position of the head that is critical
A	hm
B	no I'm sure I found a book on our bookshelves cos we have a used book
A	what was it about?
B	I can't remember that either
B	I think
A	something to do with posture and
B	no no no no
A	oh right
B	it was a novel
A	cos you were alluding to
B	no no no no no no
A	oh you got it
B	yes
A	oh cool
B	but I can't remember
B	but I knew I thought you might
A	I just so rarely find books that I'm excited to read nowadays
B	mm
A	engrossed by it and not have the motivation to
B	mm
A	to keep on reading it
B	no
A	so long
B	but I thoroughly enjoyed that er Brian Moore book
A	who's he?
B	he's a rugby player
A	oh
B	pitbull
A	is it about rugby though?
B	no
A	oh
B	well there's bits of it that are about rubgy obviously
A	mm
B	but he's been a nail bar technician
A	you what?
A	oh God
A	and he's a rugby player?
B	yep
A	why?
B	well he was a bit of a an aggressive rugby player
A	but he had a nail bar
B	but he had a
A	slightly incongruous
B	yes
B	mm
A	yes
B	yes I just thought yes
A	ah
B	and as much as people vilify Jeremy Clarkson I actually enjoy reading his books
B	they're very rude and irreverent
A	I know but he's just so up himself
B	oh I know  I know
A	he thinks the world of himself
B	but yes but you don't have to look at it that way
A	have you read that um?
B	more Thoughts of Chairman Moore
A	ah
B	that's him
A	yeah he looks familiar
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	oh
B	no
A	yet? No?
B	no this is really on um rugby but it's
A	mhm
B	us old-fashioned PE teachers have been saying for years
B	yeah er it's he talks a lot of sense
A	did dad finish that book by that Indian author?
B	I'm not sure
A	Cos that's a good test of whether a book is enthralling or not
B	no you see there's British tennis where does it go from here? So he's not focusing solely on on rugby
A	oh
B	he looks at you know sporting red tape and how to remove it
A	does he write um anything about how sport doesn't exist anymore and how it's all about profit?
B	oh that's quite a lot of things that he says
A	yep
B	you know
A	yep
B	yep
A	ah
B	he's er football he he he has some very good tut idea
A	and what does he say about
B	and the Olympics and
A	sky News?
B	oh they're basically money-grabbing
B	that they're a load of sharks basically
A	yep
B	that they're not interested in sport
A	oh yeah
B	no
A	look who's home
B	oh he's here
A	there must have been no traffic around Oxford
B	yes
B	very good time
A	okay
B	no it's
A	let's go and put the kettle on shall we?
B	interesting
