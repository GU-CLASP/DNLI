A	yeah to what?
B	to buy
A	I bought a Compaq flash card
B	that's allowed
A	that's allowed
C	I didn't have to pay for it cos I've got the vouchers
A	that's good yeah
C	when I paid thirty pound for a two gig last year at the shop for from
B	just last year
A	well that shop in
C	he's a bit expensive
A	he's a bit expensive isn't he?
B	it's funny isn't it? Cos we've still got  we've still got  sixteen what is it?
A	yeah we've got sixteen megabytes
B	what is it megabytes?
A	megabytes
B	memory stick
A	memory sticks right?
B	it takes about two photographs
A	when when we first bought the Sony
B	we'd
A	and that was a five megapixel
B	yeah funny isn't it?
A	and that take that took five on five and about eighteen on the
B	it took loads on the five megapixel didn't it?
A	but this one
C	it's amazing
A	Cos these new ones
B	that's right because I did use it the other day not thinking
A	but that went on fine that was on
B	yes well
A	I mean well you can't take when you got that that three gig
B	oh I don't know
A	three no it's how many megapixels can you take you take now? It can take
B	well anyway
C	it
A	yeah
C	you can have it on flat
A	you can even take  pictures can't you?
C	yeah fine
A	I'll tell you what the new Cannon's look brilliant
C	but I'm not having one
A	no no
C	but you've got a long lens
A	well that's not a that's not
B	it's quite good
C	what what have you got? A three hundred?
A	yeah yeah but
B	he wants to take birds
A	yeah but it's got
B	can't take birds
A	I want to take birds
C	but the
A	no you can't no
B	no
C	so that means you've got to swap and change
A	well you have to actually
B	it's annoying isn't it
C	yeah
B	one
C	long lens
B	and then of course you want another one for the macro and another one midrange
C	just midrange yeah
B	three cameras yeah
A	that bloke who who lives in the  in the  Maasai
C	yeah I know what you mean
A	maasai desert Maasai
C	the eh game park game reserve
A	yeah
C	well he probably earns a fair little bit from the pictures that he actually takes
A	he probably does yeah
B	there you go
C	so yeah
A	but he's got he lot and you just see him and he  and he  spends
C	maasai Mara yeah
A	he spends about six month a year in there and then he goes home to Paris and sorts all his pictures out and that will take him just as long to sort all his pictures out cos he's took thousands
C	that's the normal rule isn't it?
A	and then he's got to work through the hundred and he finishes up with five or six
C	you think what they used to say about a reel of thirty-six the old-fashioned film
A	yeah
B	and that's if you're lucky really
A	yeah
B	but we don't travel we don't see tigers and lions and giraffes and
A	so therefore you don't need a big lens
B	no
A	look I need
C	okay then buy an attachment for your telescope that you can put your camera to
B	mm
A	oh yeah that that would be good wouldn't it?
C	it's not really ours
A	but that's not really a telescope is it? That's a
B	you're only looking
C	yeah but you can still get the adapter
A	they left it here for
B	yeah but it might cost too much
C	I don't know how much they are
A	I'd love to get one and just fix it on there
C	they're not that much
A	Cos I find it
B	what your not much is
C	pardon?
B	is not what our not much is
C	no my my not much in money terms is probably less that your not much now
B	ooh I don't think so
A	I'd love to get the adapter
B	twenty
A	I don't know how much well they
C	if you just get the right attachment for it
A	yeah

C	yeah
A	oh I see
C	and and

C	we supported the head
A	oh I see
C	we supported the head at that point in time to keep him in his job
A	yeah
C	all the staff stood together the governors stood together
A	yeah
C	alright? And then when we were going into the academy we stuck together on the right of we don't want to be part of
