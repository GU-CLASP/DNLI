A	mm
C	and erm so we could go up there for a weekend erm and erm
A	yeah
C	you pop in and see
A	yeah
C	so you could do that within a you know two days which would be
A	mm
C	so we're we're we're we're thinking about doing that
A	right
C	it's it surround er it's it coincides it's
A	right
C	and we went there two years ago and on National Day they have it's erm
A	right
C	along the lake Lake Geneva and that sort of thing
A	oh lovely yeah mm
C	and it's really really quite
A	mm
C	you know we could go up half half half pass half
B	yeah
C	and and locally of course it's it's free in the in the area erm and we we we kind of we enjoyed our time there last time
A	yeah mm hm
C	so we're going to go up there and and and and investigate this time
B	sounds good
C	yeah so erm
A	right
C	and then we we got this erm er we went on this Fred Olsen ship back in March to the Baltic last year and the same ship is going round er Barbados and the islands around there
A	oh right
C	so we're gonna do a little little tour there and virtually every day you get to a
A	right
C	Antigua St Lucia
A	oh right
C	and er so we're gonna do do that and then I think there's two days at sea
A	right
C	and we fly back from
A	mm
B	oh
A	well we do we got off every day didn't we? and did something yeah
B	yeah got off
C	yeah yeah yeah I know
B	well that's
C	I mean to get from from Southampton to
B	yes
C	yeah
B	yes that's a bit tedious
C	yeah well
B	when we went to the Mediterranean we had one day on the boat
C	mm
B	and one night
A	mm
B	before we got to the first call was er
C	mm
B	erm and actually it wasn't very smooth was it across the Bay of Biscay?
C	yeah yeah
B	oh and there was one day on the Rhine cruise where we were sailing all day down the river but there's so much to see
C	mm
B	and it was lovely on board
A	and they had this ongoing party on the roof all the time
B	yeah super day
C	yeah yeah
B	super day
A	I mean I quite like days like that where you just you were able just to sit down a read a book
C	mm
A	instead of being interrupted all the time in what you're trying to do
B	yes
C	yeah yeah
B	yes
A	erm but I've never found those those Viking tours there's too much going on really
C	mm
A	you know? we we often say well we'll
B	yeah there's always something
A	well you know
B	we we missed quite a lot of things just to sit down for a bit
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	sat and watched television didn't we? watched a couple of films on television which were very good
A	yeah
B	oh yes of course relevant to the area
C	oh yeah yes
A	relevant to the area
B	the Bridge at Remagen and er
A	yeah we saw so you have all that sort of
B	A Bridge too Far and
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I mean I don't mean we sat in and watched telly
C	mm
A	er and then in the evening we had the meal and
B	yeah it was good wasn't it?
A	well we would get out and we would just you know erm
C	mm
B	but yeah you need to get off the boat every day I think
C	mm mm mm mm
A	yeah
B	so
C	mm
B	yes
C	erm
A	that's er yeah that's it for you
C	we we've had we've we've done six six or
A	right
C	and it had been
A	yeah yeah
C	it's really bizarre
A	yeah
C	absolutely bizarre
A	we had a a run of three different places we went to
C	mm
A	but actually we were really tired afterwards
C	mm mm
A	because we seem to be as soon as we were unpacking we were packing for something else
C	yeah I know
A	and I don't really want to get into that again
C	yeah
A	I would rather they be a bit more isolated
C	yeah yeah
A	we were hoping next week to go down to
C	mm mm
A	erm because we do like the
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	er erm
C	mm mm
A	so it's it's a bit difficult
C	mm mm
A	just to do some spring cleaning jobs that I can't get round to all the time and erm
C	mm
A	because the problem with that is that you cancel her and immediately if you get poorly you think oh I need someone to to help me a bit so there you go anyway
C	mm mm
B	yeah
unknown_female	oh sorry
A	that's okay
C	that's alright that's okay that's okay
B	thank you
C	yep
A	oh lovely thank you very much
C	oh okay
B	well
C	cheers
B	cheers
A	hang on a minute I'll just get myself sorted out
C	sorry
B	oh sorry you have to make your drink
unknown_female	impatient
B	they are men are impatient
A	thank you
C	one one thing I I'm going to different hotels is is is is your you know you've got your little writing pad and pen I've got pens now and writing pads from from from
A	that you get
C	from all
B	well I've got loads of the little
C	yeah
A	cheers
A	cheers let's just clink again for the tape we're clinking again for the tape
B	oh yeah
C	cheers yeah
A	tape we're having a nice drink now
C	clink
A	lovely
C	mm mm
A	I've made a mess now on the nice clean table
C	at the moment I'm
A	oh yes?
A	that sounds
C	it does
C	yes it is
A	yeah
C	and for one reason or another
A	yourself yeah
A	nice work if you can get it
A	I'd love to join you in that but I'm afraid I can't have wine any more which is terribly sad but there you go
C	so anyway we're we we're slowly whittling it down but it does
A	yeah
C	it it it's erm
A	yeah
C	and so
A	how many bottles have you? how many bottles have you got then?
C	well we've we've we've got we've got bottles of erm we've picked up bottles of
A	no
C	oh yeah
A	you can have a party
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	you could invite all the people that have helped you over the years with the house and
C	yeah
A	people who
C	yeah
A	just have a party
C	well that's true
A	the trouble is if if you might not want everyone trudging in
C	no no no no no no don't want that no no
A	well we we we er get a bit like that we think well
C	yeah
A	come in on a wet night with muddy shoes and walk all over the carpet and
C	yeah
A	at least the smoking business is now over
C	yeah yeah
A	nobody smokes in
C	no
A	well
C	yeah yeah
B	well we're erm
C	mm
B	and the concept is to use up all my air miles
C	yeah great
B	so of course you used to be able to use airmails and get free flights
A	mm mm
B	and that was it
C	oh right
A	yeah
B	and also
C	it's is it it's probably quite low though isn't it?
B	oh very low yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	and also there's
C	mm
B	anyway we're going to New York first class
C	oh first class oh brilliant oh great
B	and er
C	mm
B	but erm yeah first class with British Airways
C	yeah
B	I've done it before but erm
C	mm mm
B	and you get a jumpsuit to change into
C	yeah yeah
B	not as good as it used to be
C	mm
B	they kind of sort of
C	mm
B	British Airways first class
C	yeah
C	right
B	trousers but it's it's something
C	mm
B	the closest I remember I've ever come to a first class jumpsuit in the old style was
C	mm hm
B	I was flying somewhere
C	mm mm
B	and there was a mother and a little girl
C	mm
B	the little girl was sort of sitting between us
C	mm
B	and all the way this little girl was stuffing
C	mm
C	mm hm
B	and I looked across at her and she was green
C	oh no
B	and I thought
C	oh no
B	and just fortunately she faced her mother rather than me
C	oh no
B	so her mother got it
C	oh no
B	all over her
C	oh no
B	and I felt so sorry for her cos she you know she'd taken her just the two of them travelling together
C	yeah
B	anyway the cabin staff sort of took her off to the toilet and washed her down and whatnot
C	mm
B	in the end they gave her one of these jump suits to wear you know while her clothes were in a big bag
C	yeah
B	but now you just get
A	hi there
C	mm
B	some trousers so it's not worth it really
C	we'll we we we went we went to
B	oh
A	oh
C	and and so
A	yeah
C	but but
A	oh how marvellous
C	absolutely
B	yeah
A	who were you with British Airways?
C	Korean Air
A	oh Korean Air right
C	ah they were they were oh we were very
B	and do they treat you as
C	erm they
B	yeah
C	cos individually so it's like welcome aboard er
B	yes
C	hope you're you know
B	yes yes yes
A	oh isn't that lovely?
C	and I thought
B	yes
C	oh right okay
B	and immediately greets you oh welcome Mr
C	oh right right
B	you know
C	oh
B	they've got some means and you're conducted to your seat here we are
C	yeah
B	you don't get that with British Airways I'm afraid even in first class I don't think you get that but
C	yeah no
A	did er did er
C	yeah absolutely
A	that's
C	yeah yeah
A	but the only the only
B	it's bank holiday Monday you see
A	bank holiday Monday
C	mm
B	so they've probably got a few spare seats in first class
C	yeah yeah
A	and on
B	business class coming back yeah
A	so it'll be interesting comparing the two from my point of view I cos could've done all three then couldn't I?
C	yeah yeah
B	well
C	yeah yeah
B	my
A	right
B	that's assuming as I as I as I recall the first class seats they're nice and wide
A	mm
B	but they don't recline absolutely flat
A	right
B	whereas business class beds do
A	oh do they?
B	well
A	well we don't need to lie down flat on the way out
B	exactly so
A	because we're gonna be there about
B	it's the best combination
A	we're getting there about
C	yeah
A	two o'clock in the morning or something aren't we?
B	yeah
A	and so it won't be the whole night that we're there
C	yeah no
B	it it it's the best way round really
C	yeah
B	first class out and business class back
C	yeah yeah
B	in fact I think that's the way I would chose
C	yeah
B	that's the way I would choose
C	yeah
A	can I ask you something and I know
C	well they do ask for er well you could ask I mean there's no harm in asking and and erm I I you know I I I my there is er usually on the form somewhere it says special requests
A	yeah
C	whether it's erm
B	first class you can chose whatever you want anyway
C	yeah yeah
B	if you ask for a special meal all you'll get is some crummy vegetarian option
C	yeah erm
A	so
B	my
C	yeah
B	one thing I would recommend though
A	mm
B	and I've done it myself
C	mm
B	which means you can eat your meal
C	mm
A	yeah
C	whereas the ordinary food takes a lot longer
A	but the thing is with me it's not like I'm doing it
C	mm
A	you know if something makes you ill
C	mm
A	my my friend's a chef and she's also a nutritionist
C	mm
A	but she said if you go somewhere and you say
C	mm
A	there's a law a new law that's come out recently and everyone's a lot more careful now about what they give you
C	mm
A	but the only problem arises when you have foreign staff serving you who don't understand English properly
C	no exactly yeah yeah yeah
A	and they say oh good
C	mm
B	yeah
A	if you have somebody like
C	we had
A	can I have this and that that waiter
C	mm
A	in that gravy
C	mm
A	which is on your
C	mm
A	and little bits of bacon it's terribly tasty
C	mm
A	erm
C	mm
A	not here but I mean I might try it again today see if the chef can do cos they're ever so helpful
C	mm
A	really?
C	erm they
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	China is
A	that bad
C	so
A	I'll tell you I'll tell you what happened at
C	yeah
A	I wrote well in advance and said you know yeast-free sugar-free gluten-free
C	mm mm
A	but unfortunately we didn't know until we got there that the hotel was changing hands
B	yeah
A	and the chef
C	mm
A	and he was trying to
C	on trial
A	trial for murdering food and he was on trial
C	mm
A	the new
C	mm
A	so everything had to be like a wedding banquet
C	mm
A	and on a wedding banquet you don't know what you're getting
C	mm
A	there's a bit of this and a bit of that and a you know
C	mm
A	and they said to me they were giving me gluten-free yeast-free bread and now I would query whether I had that because
C	mm
A	the bread was gorgeous I really enjoyed it
C	mm mm
A	it tastes like
C	mm
A	and it tastes ghastly so
C	mm
A	erm but anyway it doesn't matter it didn't seem to do me any harm at the time whatever I was having
C	yeah
A	they did they did they kept assuring me that it was yeast-free gluten-free but I don't know how they got it to taste like that
C	mm
A	because my friend who's
C	mm
A	and it's not it's nothing like the texture
C	mm
A	I've made it
C	mm
A	I've made it
C	mm
A	they taste disgusting
C	mm
A	and they make
C	mm
A	but you know remember
C	have
A	sorry
C	have you started googling? erm because I
A	yeah I've done all of that yeah
C	have you? yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah I've done all of that
B	I think the best thing about first or business class is that
C	yeah yeah yes yes yes
B	but usually you can get through a slightly faster channel
C	yeah yeah
A	well what about taking
B	well yeah
C	that was that was that was the nicest nicest amazing
B	it er it it does vary
C	yeah yeah
B	I I've been caught you know as bad as anybody else but
C	mm hm
B	erm normally at least you it
C	mm
B	cos you know it's a good
C	well I see well
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	no no but but
B	it's all finished
C	we went to this lounge erm and
B	yeah
C	so we could have our we we arrived there early morning so we had our breakfast or
C	but
B	yeah
C	I I was
A	yeah and then they and they don't like people going on the plane drunk
C	yeah I know I
A	it's crazy
C	but but but having said that they had the nicest coffee so we had a lovely coffee a nice meal
A	come and go
C	this this is with Korean Air you see?
A	oh Korean air?
C	and and yeah and I I I mean obviously
B	yeah
C	the lounges were obviously there are lots of lounges for different
A	mm
B	yeah
C	erm
A	is this when you went to Cuba?
C	this no this is when we'd just been to New Zealand
A	New Zealand?
C	yeah yeah
A	really?
B	yes the British Airways lounge at terminal five
C	mm
B	which is where we shall go is is
A	I've been in there
B	no
A	oh I went in a very good lounge with him once
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	very
C	mm
B	oh yeah
C	mm
B	and first class lounges
C	yeah yeah
B	three course meal and it's all free of course
C	mm mm
B	and as you say enough drink
C	yeah
B	any amount of drink
C	yeah yeah
B	whatever you want which
C	mm mm mm mm
B	but of course there comes a point where
C	yes yes yeah
B	people like this Ryanair business at the moment
C	oh
B	yeah
C	but we thought we
B	yeah
C	so you you
A	yeah oh yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
A	I would I
C	mm mm yeah I know
B	but the point is of course if you're
C	yeah yeah
B	because of course the food on the plane may not be that brilliant
C	yeah
B	and very often in business class you get served some very good food
C	mm
B	but it's quite small
C	yeah yeah
B	you know you actually end up being quite hungry
C	yeah yeah
A	the
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	and the only way you can do that is to drink as much water as possible
C	yeah
A	erm
C	no no no
A	just keep yourself hydrated
C	mm mm mm
A	my body won't stand it I used to do it and the other thing we found out very soon on
C	mm
A	I can't drink if I drink orange juice it just burns my stomach
C	mm
A	so
B	the thing about aircraft of course
C	mm
A	mm
B	which makes you very sensitive to our
A	yeah yeah
C	mm mm
B	erm I often think that
C	mm
B	and there's just a bit left at the bottom and you put the bottle on the side there
B	we'll do it when we fly
A	yeah
B	pressure drops to about a third of the normal atmosphere
C	mm
B	and you really
C	mm
A	well it affects my sinuses I mean
C	mm hm
A	and we took photographs of ourselves on the beach and we both look as white as sheets
A	and I look like I'm well I look really ill
C	mm
A	and within two or three days in the sun my sinus had gone I couldn't hear when we touched down
C	mm mm
B	yeah some of it is is the brain itself though
A	my sinus had gone it
B	yeah yeah
A	I was wearing summer dresses and the Maltese kept saying ooh you're wearing summer dresses they were going round in cardigans and winter boots
C	mm
A	and do you remember? I've got those photographs we took round the pool and I actually said to the gardener
C	mm
A	oh it was absolutely gorgeous
C	that was a good pool
A	that was a lovely pool wasn't it?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	I'll never forget that because
C	mm I think so
A	and we got we got through the funeral and everything
A	it was
C	it was a
A	yeah
C	it was sunny most of the time of all the time I think
A	yeah it was
B	it was incredible really to get good weather in in Malta because
B	yeah
A	well we went to
B	mm
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and we were on the beach and there was nobody on the beach except for us
C	and
A	golden beach it was a huge beach it was the most like going
C	yeah
A	because it's called golden beach and it's huge and
C	yeah
A	it was bizarre the whole thing
C	it was bizarre
A	yeah oh we we need to go
C	er but
A	yes
C	is a hell of a long time and think
A	I went back
C	yeah
B	well when we went to
C	mm
A	yeah it was yeah it was
B	it was quite deserted but it wasn't a terribly good hotel unfortunately
A	it was quite deserted because it was a extremely hot
C	mm
A	and they had trouble with animals dying the
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	and the smell in our room was just unbelievable
C	oh
A	and erm they moved us two or three
C	yeah yeah
A	I think it's one of these places that's closed down through the winter they open it up in the summer but they never really properly refurbish it
C	mm
A	and
B	yeah basically it's overdue for a major
A	did did we tell you about that? they picked us up in the dark didn't they?
B	they did yeah yeah
A	and we got into this boat and and the waves were like this
A	and I'd just got off an aeroplane
C	oh no
A	oh and and I was so terribly sick and and the guy
A	you drink you drink he said you drink
A	and I thought I said no but I can't drink that that's the last thing I should be drinking
A	I and just amazing really
C	yeah
A	anyway erm
B	yeah
A	yeah and there's only one hotel
C	mm
B	it's a place that was
A	it has that sort of
B	overdue
A	you can walk all over the island
B	if it was rebuilt it would be fantastic
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	I mean I can imagine it probably has been rebuilt by now
A	do you think so?
B	let's look it up
A	oh yeah we'll look it up
C	oh yes yeah
A	this is your next holiday you and
B	it was called the
A	I think so
B	free wi-fi here of course
A	we went
B	yeah we had a
A	or was it
