B	my mum goes because like
A	I know my dad does as well
B	like all I've got on my wardrobe are these erm
B	oh and my dad nicks them
B	I just went around all the places he has cups of tea like his study you know like today
A	and there's these snowmen
B	no just empty packets of malt biscuits and Fox's biscuits I was gonna get you the nice Fox's ones but they've all gone
B	it's bad
A	well I guess they are his biscuits
B	so carry on
A	no he's just like being really supportive he's like
B	well he's a laugh isn't he
A	yeah
B	that's really informative
A	well if you have to try all the beers and stuff
A	probably not
B	there's no bread
A	I wouldn't mind being one of their workers cos
B	his
A	own the restaurant and hotel yeah
B	and they own a hotel as well?
A	well it's a hotel restaurant it's all one thing
B	how big is it then?
A	so
B	is it quite busy?
A	it's a bit like
B	I want to
A	we can go
B	I nearly said to you actually I'd meet you out there for a couple of days but
A	it's alright
B	like imagine having a gatecrasher there these are a bit stale aren't they?
A	yeah but I I can still eat them
B	good?
A	come on
B	oh there's
A	hello
B	look at him
A	yeah but he is fluffy so maybe that's making him look a bit fatter
B	oh he's huge come on didn't you come home and think oh my god he's grown twice the size?
A	yeah I did kind of think oh he's fat
B	in fact she's weird she seems to fluctuate every time I see her
A	mm
B	she's either really big or she's tiny
A	she's got flabby skin
A	on a diet
B	workout and when she doesn't
A	mm
A	that's what I thought it does look quite cute when she's eating but the problem is she kind of drops it and it goes all over the floor and then you get all this dry food all over the floor
B	are you gonna take her to the vet at all? does that mean she can't eat in her mouth?
A	well she she's eating
B	yeah
A	maybe she got bored with getting her nose all dirty
B	maybe
A	but I never clean the the floor and her cat bowl and today it was just so disgusting I thought right I've got to and it was all dried on where it's been there for like days
B	don't
A	all up the wall it was splashed
B	oh yeah
A	disgusting
B	I do love the cats but I think my mum does loads of that
A	yeah I mean fortunately cats are quite easy to clean I mean it's just their food bowl that you really need to worry about isn't it?
B	could you imagine a dog?
A	oh my god
B	what? what's wrong? what was that little squeal for?
A	come on
B	say hello to
A	hello
A	yeah
B	did I tell you about when we got him?
A	no
B	she got hit by a car
A	oh no
B	cos that was
A	right
B	and her he the mum was really fluffy and really pretty as well erm and then yeah she got hit by a car and they were gonna keep him if we hadn't taken him so they were he would have been the one to keep
A	oh
B	cos he was the only ginger one in there
A	you didn't tell us that we had
B	yeah
A	we didn't tell us
B	oh I think we did I think we did

B	oh
A	yeah
B	cos rock climbing and stuff like you can do it in
A	yeah cos it's all indoor isn't it?
B	it's not cheap yeah
A	and it would be much more fun to do it like where there's actual like rocks rather than
B	mm yeah
A	erm
B	remember remember doing it at Guides and things do you remember doing it?
A	yeah vaguely and I
B	yeah I didn't go to that

A	and there's nothing coming through
B	and there's nothing coming up and I'm like oh god
A	there will be there will be

A	have you thought about like other things that aren't NHS
B	well yeah but I said to mum well you know I I like working for the NHS I get my I get my pension paid into
A	mm
B	they're just they're just the things that I
A	yeah
B	I get you know I I enjoy it I enjoy working in hospitals and
A	you don't get paid?
B	you don't get paid it's self employed
A	I used to get paid at Staples for being sick actually that was quite good for a part time job
B	but that yeah that's a contract yeah everyone does
A	mm my mum doesn't
B	does she not?
A	no
B	I didn't realise your mum wasn't salaried actually

B	erm yeah she said to me in this one to one oh we we're we've put an extension for you for April
A	well I think you
B	I'm just
A	to be honest
B	like cos it's the funding cos obviously with the NHS in general
A	yeah
B	like the funding is so poor at the moment I'm worried that they won't won't cos it has they have to apply for the funding to keep me
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	that's a good sign
B	so that their their
A	and
B	their funding allows me to stay I suppose
A	if they don't then just see it as an opportunity to try something new
B	yeah
A	while you're young and carefree
B	I mean I don't even know if it's it's like I I love I don't keep up
A	well everyone does everyone makes a difference every step of the journey makes a difference
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they're old
A	that's the nature of this job though you're gonna have to learn to deal with that
B	yeah exactly and like I said that I said to my mum yesterday I was like that is just totally something I'm gonna have to get used to
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	tai chi sorry I've forgotten the words there
A	well

B	and I need to go to the bank as well
A	yeah fair enough
B	do my washing
A	it's four pounds in erm
B	Tesco community centre?
A	you know where the café used to be
B	they've got a community centre there in Tesco's?
A	it's like a room that you can book out for
B	no
A	there's a new café the other side where the tills are
B	what and Tesco equips it?
A	mm they've got a new café downstairs and right at the front and then upstairs is a community room so they do like yoga sessions you can do knitting sessions you can book it out for like toddler and baby sessions

A	yeah I know it's crazy my dad
B	do you like it? is it very
A	mm
B	calming?
A	I'm the youngest one there by about thirty years but
A	it's quite good
B	how are you finding the house? like are you like living with your mum and dad or is it kind of?
A	no I don't mind living with my mum and dad it's just like because they're all they're
B	oh
A	on Friday which was nice so that was nice cos it's the first time I've been out in ages
B	yeah
A	I'm going
B	how are they both doing?
A	at the
B	yeah
A	or this week now
B	yeah
A	it's like I may as well just get it in now and then I don't think oh I haven't got any money
B	yeah I know I know exactly what you mean I always put my rent and stuff in I always put all my bills
A	I know and then it's
B	just all in and it's
A	all disappears doesn't it?
B	all just er goes and I
A	I like that though just getting it all out of the way
B	yeah
A	oh you just sprayed coffee all over me
B	sorry sorry I'm gonna do it now before I forget erm
A	good idea
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she's never had internet banking
A	never had internet banking? how do you live without internet banking?
B	I I thank you and I was like do you not have the app like do you not any of of these things on your phone? and she was like no she's been ringing up the their phone line and still paying her banking and stuff
A	oh
B	and the other day er I mean I don't have as much money in my account but she erm she rang up and did it and she paid it didn't work so she kept doing it again she paid rent three times so we had like this
B	loads of money in this account I mean like she's obviously got a lot of savings that she's
A	oh okay so did she
B	oh yeah we transferred it all back to her we were like you're an idiot why are you not internet banking? and then was it last month? yeah last month we paid rent and we went to the overdraft and sorry the erm account
A	oh
B	so the month before she paid it three times and then she hadn't paid it at all
B	it was like well it's
A	maybe you should have just kept it in there
B	sorry
A	and then she wouldn't have had to have paid for three months
B	yeah
A	why didn't you just do it that way or did she not have enough money to do it that way?
B	well no I think she wanted kind of money in her
A	her account
B	her account yeah
A	yeah
B	she owes me money actually
B	yeah she owes me forty quid I just forgot about that
A	I know
B	right pay bill
A	is it seven thirty a month you pay?
B	no I pay six ninety but I owe twenty-five pounds into it for erm
A	oh right
B	and I think I owe a few more pounds here and there
A	do you all share food then and eat together?
B	no we did a Tesco shop between us but we do buy house food but
A	oh right
B	and we do sometimes
A	what like bread and milk and stuff and that sort of
B	yeah the sort of basics and then
A	yeah
B	the rest of the time we usually just eat you know eat our own
A	although you can't eat bread and milk so
B	yeah
A	so you've paid for that
B	I've no I have
B	it clearly I don't eat bread but it's also normal bread is like one pound or ninety-nine P and mine's is three pounds seventy or whatever it is so that's three pounds
A	oh right so you just buy it separately
B	so I think sometimes I really should buy it
A	why don't you get a bread maker and then you could make gluten free bread? you can make gluten bread
B	you really like these bread makers at the moment don't you?
A	love it
B	right I have something else to
A	no
B	she got engaged in August last year
A	ah
B	and she's our we're we're going to the hen do in Budapest which you've been to haven't you?
A	no I've never been to Hungary
B	yeah apparently it's lovely
A	I'd love to go to Hungary yeah
B	who did?
A	and
B	did she?
A	yeah she was doing some job out there and
B	what does she do? I don't know what she does
A	she works in theatre like a production manager or something so she works on shows and there was a show going on in Budapest that she was working on
B	I thought
A	no just theatre
B	why?
A	and erm oh he got made redundant
B	oh wow
A	erm yeah I guess it's just funding and stuff they don't have as much as they did have did they? so they just had to let people go and
B	oh it's hell at the moment isn't it? it's genuinely hell
A	but yeah fortunately he's got a new job pretty quickly
B	sorry
A	that's the microphone
B	oh
A	who
B	mm
A	well he's quite new there so I guess he is at the moment whether it'll stay that way I don't know
B	why didn't you?
A	no I am going to it's a cos I I just put tabs up on my computer of jobs I see and then gradually I apply for them but I haven't applied for that one yet it's a digital marketing assistant
B	oh
A	Royal Shakespeare Company that could sounds quite fun
B	that would be really fun but what do you do at digital marketing what would you do?
A	it's just like it means marketing but you do it online so I guess it's just like the modern marketing
B	is marketing something you wanna do then? is marketing cos I thought you wanted to do more sort of publishing and writing
A	I do but then it all kind of
B	wow
A	they're all kind of under the same umbrella
B	that's brill
A	I mean marketing is mostly writing anyway cos you have to write emails and you you have to write press releases and you have to write erm I don't know posters or leaflets or whatever
B	what about a erm you have to write people's speeches? is it ghost writing?
B	I know oh I think that's the worst job ever I don't know who would do it
B	oh
A	they just went onto the website with no name
B	no this is the nature of the job so anything you do
A	no I could say this is the website I wrote for this is my article but there's no proof it's my article they would just have to take my word for it so it's not really the same as having it in my portfolio but I've got quite a big portfolio anyway
B	cos imagine if you had a really erm I dunno English spy type name like John Smith
A	yeah oh and it could be anyone
B	yeah how do they know it's definitely you?
A	I dunno I guess they just kind of
B	you'd have to you'd have to ask wouldn't you?
A	that kind of thing that is kind of just trust isn't it?
B	cos there must a zillion John Smiths in the country imagine searching for articles by John Smith you'd be you'd be everywhere
B	you know you read books like Fifty Shades
A	yeah
B	it's a really good example but she got into publishing there and then got in straight into a job it's obviously not like that
A	yeah it is really competitive cos everyone wants to do it and then you've got to do like work experience to prove that you want to do it and to have work experience you need money to do the work experience in the first place and it's like you have to do all this free work before you actually get paid
B	yeah
B	it sucks
A	I've done so much free work
B	yeah do you feel angry? do you feel like angry and?
A	yeah I just wanna be paid now
A	but such is life I mean
B	it does
A	and it's all stuff I've enjoyed I guess like
B	and at least you've carried on like in a way that you haven't wanted a job that's like full time a full time wage and you've got the money there and then you don't have it anymore and you have some more experience
A	yeah
B	at least you're on a continual kind of you you know what internships is like and you know it's gonna be for something in the long run
A	yeah like that's the thing
B	I always think that about people that do their masters cos
A	mm
B	to pay for a masters on the side
A	oh right yeah
B	and it was just pittance money and although it was ridiculous but with the training she said you know I've I've
A	mm
B	but she was like I've just got no money ever well she has because she's still got quite a lot of inheritance from her
A	whereas me I've never got money
B	yeah
A	I've just got offered a
B	where? what what was this from then another one?
A	yeah this is the
B	where was this one?
B	where's
B	what at
A	no it's south but it's west er westerly it's more westerly it's quite far like it's not somewhere I could commute to every day and I'd have to go into London and then out to get to it
B	what
A	yeah it's like that kind of way it's not in
B	oh okay
A	so like
B	for how long?
A	they said when however long you want to do it for so I probably would do it for two weeks but erm I would have to stay somewhere because and I'd have to get there and I didn't I just didn't have the money and I had to be like sorry can't come
B	oh but you've been to Peru
A	I know it just would have been really cos it was like a children's book publisher as well so that would have been really cool
B	oh
A	and she was like you can work in all the different departments and see what you like best and then
B	oh that would be good
A	maybe if I get enough from my these two jobs and my Jobseeker's I might see if I can make it work
B	yeah
A	if I can find a cheap a really cheap bed and breakfast and just pay for a train ticket there and a train ticket back hopefully I might be able to make it work but we'll see I have to wait till my money's in first
B	and what are your mum and dad saying about it all? are they like
A	they don't know
B	okay are they are they like really supportive of all or are they?
A	yeah
B	they are aren't they? but they're like the
A	yeah they want me to get a job cos they keep paying for everything for me
B	yeah
A	vegetables she was like oh I don't want you to get a job cos I want to come home to lovely dinners
B	ah
B	that's cute makes you little little comments like that make you feel
A	yeah
B	a bit better don't they?
A	I won't come home and the dishwater will be done and the washing will all be done I'm oh yes I'm miss labour am I? well yes you are
B	see you can't win though cos I've been how long have I? I've obviously been in
B	is that cos I've gone? and she said yeah
A	yes
B	and I
B	I said I'm sorry for
A	now she's just got
B	yeah
A	here there and everywhere to pay for
B	well and then I what else did I erm?
A	money parents
B	parents
A	living away
B	yeah sorry so that yeah that's what I was gonna say so yeah she says
A	ah
B	are you gonna come home? and you can come home
A	well at least you live in
B	yeah
A	I know I'm waiting I'm waiting for a niece or nephew I'm waiting for a wedding
B	he's he's making her a salon
A	I know
B	who does that? I said to I said to mum and I was like
A	she's so jammy
B	I can't get my head round this I cannot get my head round it
A	yeah I think they are
B	building her a salon it's a business he's built her a business
A	I think they intend to be
B	they've just gone fifteen thousand pounds over their bloody extension budget and I said so they're
B	but you can't you can't leave someone that's built you a salon
A	er
B	she would yeah
A	yeah I think they are intending to stay together
B	yeah
A	but sometimes she doesn't charge me when she knows I haven't got any money
B	that's not bad
A	which is nice
A	to pay her?
B	yeah I usually put about twenty twenty-five pounds and I said I'd transfer it and I think I just forgot I never
A	oh never mind
B	and cos I went back to
B	not jealous at all that you're toning when you see her
A	well it's like clinical Pilates it she pays like sixty pounds a month for it
B	what?
A	or something and she pays an extortionate amount of money it's like a clinical one for people with back problems
B	oh wow
A	it's like a special one yeah so she pays like extortionate amounts to go to this Pilates class
B	how how often is it? is it once once a week?
A	I think it's once a week yeah
B	does it help?
A	she says it does
B	does she get back trouble now a little bit?
A	well she doesn't anymore cos she does Pilates but
B	cos she sort of she's got that curvature hasn't she?
A	yeah and I think she's just got to keep an eye on it for the rest of her life just to make sure she doesn't overexert herself maybe
B	I know
A	I'm really dreading this journey tomorrow
A	why did I apply for this stupid job?
B	you don't yeah you don't seem that keen on it
A	no I am it's
B	I just love the fact you send your CV to here there and everywhere and you're like mm no
A	I just don't think
B	yeah cos they must get quite a few and it's nice to know that you've got shortlisted like
A	yeah
B	out of probably hundreds of applications and you've got a job interview
A	yeah it is nice to know I just hope I get offered another one so l don't feel compelled to take that one
B	what are you gonna do then if they then before the third of March get
B	get hold of you and ask you about it? are you just gonna decline it anyway cos it's a last resort option what about if they get through to you?
A	first?
A	yeah
B	it's tomorrow
A	I know
B	that's
B	erm
A	I don't know
B	that's like that job down here I applied for it didn't think I'd ever get it and I got the job
A	you're in
B	yeah
A	yeah I know that's what I mean you did it as well that's what I mean but
B	slightly different
A	no it's just hard cos it does look like a really cool job I think to be honest when I applied for it I didn't even look where it was
A	doing mini tours around erm
B	you didn't get interviewed for that? you
B	oh yeah that's amazing
A	logo on and erm people can just play them and sometimes you could send down a representative to do like music competitions with the public and then
B	well when's this?
A	tomorrow
B	oh this is the one tomorrow?
A	yeah
B	you didn't say this is the one tomorrow
A	yeah this is the one for tomorrow
B	so what are you gonna say? do you wanna expand on it now? do you wanna go through it now? do you er want me to?
A	yeah they just said expand so I'm just between us
B	like I said all this in my interview like
A	yeah
B	I thought it was about
A	I'm not sure how I can expand on it to be honest
B	yeah it's like I can't really expand anymore really
A	I mean I'm not like a logistics manager I don't know where you're gonna get all these things from or the money that's your job
B	yeah is is it is there someone to think of all these ideas and some poor sods got to do the logistics?
A	yeah the marketing the marketing is the marketing company has to think of the ideas and then the logistics
B	the poor old logistics the
A	and finance have to make it happen
B	oh I feel sorry for them really they get major pooed on don't they?
A	I know
B	oh my it's another one?
A	he hasn't got to me actually but
B	if anything you have them out of your ears which is really good
B	doesn't she go out with him anymore?
A	oh no they broke up in like August
B	why?
A	she's living back in
B	what happened?
A	basically what happened was apparently it was going downhill for a while and they kept talking and he kept saying well I'll change I'll change and then he never did and
B	well what was wrong with him?
A	oh no that's sad he's got is she having a stroke?
B	yeah it's all over Facebook
A	mm
B	she's
A	well
B	that's right
A	and she said I just needed to get out cos I knew if I spoke to him it would just be the same all over again

A	it's called
B	oh my word I know it

A	no it's kind of like it's a job and he just happens to work there and you know
B	yeah
A	and erm I mean the likelihood of me getting it anyway is slim but
B	legend you're an absolute legend
A	who bloody knows mate? it's on
A	mm he sent me pictures of the office and he was like yeah we've got like a bar and we just drink beer all day and you've got all these comfy seats it looks like a really cool office like there's there's like seats shaped like circles in like all different colours and I was like wow that looks like a good office

A	well apparently he they they've just started arguing a lot and not really connecting in an emotional way and erm
B	in an emotional capacity
A	in an emotional capacity and yeah and she was
B	isn't it funny that everything
A	yeah
B	that's erm that's how long term relationships start that is
A	oh oh
B	yeah
A	well that's what I want
B	honestly I read I read a er I'm always reading studies these days and that's why I'm not in a relationship cos I read all about them so much
B	I know about this erm they were saying yeah like if you start off kind of it it grows into something rather than it being an initial kind of
A	yes
B	passion and it fizzles out
A	because I didn't fancy him
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so they're always in tandem they're not like there's not a big gap
B	which is potentially where I'm going wrong
A	potentially
A	you need to find yourself someone you don't fancy and try and find ways and things to like about them
B	apparently though mum erm cos obviously we did everything yesterday didn't we went to so we went to
A	nice
B	you know went down
A	you just went everywhere
B	into
A	yeah
B	they had everything like
A	that's true
B	like why aren't we going to
A	Harrods
B	but like where do you meet people really?
A	you work in a restaurant
B	well yeah need to do obviously what you do
A	well you might meet someone through work yeah are there no nice speech therapist there or nice doctors? you went out with a doctor didn't you?
B	yeah yeah no that was
A	yeah
B	but he's quite geeky and goony but he's a doctor and erm he cracks me up and I do get a little bit of a
A	yeah
B	a buzz but he's got a girlfriend
A	oh
B	so he's spoken for though
A	right you need to think of a plan
B	well mum yeah mum said that she was like
A	to break them up
B	she's like right what can we do?
B	and then I I don't know whether to drop it into the conversation cos I think being a being a girl asking a guy you know have you got a girlfriend?
A	yeah
B	so she was like I I mean had perfect
A	why don't you invite him round for dinner and say oh bring your girlfriend you know come and come and you and your girlfriend come round for dinner
B	oh yeah that's not creepy in any way oh my god
B	erm we were walking to the train and we yeah we get along really well really good banter and erm I I was running I was really late for a train cos I had to get I was usually going one way to
A	okay

A	and then he's like yeah you know I think we're gonna break up soon and then you're in there
B	you'll be like yes
B	I used did that with
A	oh yeah
B	I was thinking about why?
A	why did you fancy
B	why did I why? why?
A	I swear he had loads of girls fancy him at one point
B	I think he did
A	and it's it's when he took his glasses off I think cos he was a bit like
B	no I liked him with his glasses I did like
A	did you?
B	I I was the most I was the most erm consistent
A	cos I remember he was fifteen I met him in Germany he was spotty and had glasses and was really quiet and didn't speak to anyone
A	but I never fancied him
B	I nearly went out with

B	oh you went out for drinks? I thought you went out sort of shopping I don't know I thought it was shopping
A	no we went out out we went to
B	oh what's it like?
A	it was good it was right next to the
B	have a look now you've got I'll see how long
A	oh you just press that on the side
B	oh what's
A	yeah
B	I thought
A	quite good it's got like three storeys or something
B	I don't know
A	no

A	yeah it was really busy and erm
B	ah can I have a bit of that philly?
A	yeah alright
B	do you want?
A	I've just licked it with my spit
B	oh that really put me off I don't I hate spit and I'm like oh I live well I don't want the biscuit part obviously but
A	alright
B	out of our house I don't I'm always erm the one that gets least
A	yeah it is nice that way I think cos like
B	well it happened a few times lately
A	well once you get to once you get a point to a certain point it stops being enjoyable doesn't it? cos you don't remember anything and you do stupid stuff and
B	when I went out with
A	who's
B	he was my he was the doctor
A	oh right
B	he was the the date I went on
A	oh very sophisticated
B	and erm
A	mm
B	both of us did
A	mm
B	erm yeah we ended up getting absolutely slaughtered and I
A	cool
B	erm
A	mm nice
B	yeah
A	how old is
B	he's twenty-six
A	mm
B	yeah
A	the thing is
B	what if I'm if I'm like thirty and
A	life doesn't pass you by cos you'll have been doing what you enjoy if you if you stop your life to wait for someone then that's wasting your life if you do what you enjoy do what you love
B	I feel like I'm having a midlife crisis at the moment where I'm like oh my god
A	you're only twenty-four
B	I'm twenty-five this year
A	twenty-five
B	that's very true I like this thought yeah
A	yeah oh I've got a coil now
B	did you get the coil?
A	mm
B	what's it like?
A	I don't feel it it was quite painful having it inserted but
B	I really really want it but everyone's
A	mm well
B	oh yeah?
A	she was like well
B	she's nutty
B	is that the one without the hormone?
A	yeah the one without the hormone which is what I wanted
B	cos that that's what I want I don't want anything with hormone in it
A	yeah
B	I don't want to mess around with
A	no that's that's my that was my thing as well
B	mess around
A	erm so she really tried to talk me into the the hormonal one and I was like no I'd rather to be honest just avoid hormones cos you know I've been on the pill before and you know it didn't react well with me and I'd rather not risk that again she was like well it's only a tiny bit of hormone really it's a tiny bit of hormone like the pill is a lot of hormone
B	no
A	and I was like no I think I'll stick with the copper one she was like okay so she went and got the copper one and she said ah there's a problem
B	get the hormonal one in
A	oh yeah she was like it's only a tiny bit of hormone anyway and I was like yeah okay just do the small one that you've got so I've got the hormone one
B	and do you feel any different?
A	no I don't feel any different really
B	oh wow
A	minimal the amount of hormone you're getting and it's much you're much less likely to get pregnant on it than you would on the copper coil although she said the copper coil is still good for contraception but there's just a slightly higher
B	I
A	well I don't think it matters
B	cos I I
A	mm
B	I've asked about it so many times and never had it done erm and she said that you need to be on your period they prefer it if you're on your period to get it inserted
A	ah cos no one ever like
A	maybe
B	yeah
A	I dunno but anyway
B	I went to a clinic
A	I was on my
B	yeah
A	period anyway and it was a bit gross but
B	so erm
A	since last week
B	oh you've only had it for a week?
A	mm
B	oh I
A	no well I haven't had
B	oh yeah that's true
B	yeah sorry
A	erm yeah so that's that and and I said to them I went to Peru
B	bung it in
A	and I said yeah go on then
A	so I had like my I had pains from there while my coil was in and then she just jabbed a needle in and I was like ah
A	but no it was good I just got that all out of the way at one in one fell swoop so now I'm protected for hepatitis A for twenty-five years
B	I have done the hepatitis B one three times now
A	do you never finish the course?
B	no I finish it just never takes it doesn't take on dad either he's like
A	oh
B	he's had it done twice with
A	so maybe it's just a genetic thing then you
B	yeah
A	you and your dad
B	but you have
A	so you just need to make sure you have it done every time you go away
B	you have to be like over a thousand or something
A	mm
B	and erm
A	it could be your weird blood
B	I've got it done and then yeah maybe and then I've got it done and I was less than five
A	oh
B	every time less than five and I think what I don't want it done a fourth time I'm gonna be hepatitis Bd out with this
B	and the first one the first one doesn't make me feel great
A	yeah
B	and the rest of them are fine like er you know suppose if you're rejecting something and it makes you feel a bit sick?
A	yeah I know yeah yeah just make sure if you ever go somewhere just to have it done every time you go away
B	but no I work in hospitals
A	oh yeah
B	so I'm supposed to
A	oh right if it doesn't take it doesn't take does it?
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	yeah I did as well
B	they so I was like na ah and the second time no
A	you've got a weird body
B	I know
B	the system of an eight eighty year old it's a little oldie and they've never gone to the doctor's never gone to the dentist in their life
A	oh no go to the dentist you've got to go to the dentist
B	oh it was so funny this guy he came in and he
A	er
A	that's horrible
B	it was one stump and I thought well you've definitely never been to the dentist that's for sure
A	cor why do people not go to the dentist? that's
B	well he's done his whole life in
A	yeah but then you have rotten teeth
B	well I think
A	they stink
B	stink stunk of urine and there was a bit of poo in there as well and
A	oh no
B	I think he just I think
A	is he is he a bit?
B	I think so yeah
A	oh no
B	I mean I think there was a bit of an air of maybe a small stroke before that he just got on with
A	yeah
B	and then erm he is kind of declined then and when he did come to the hospital with the second stroke I mean at ninety-six he doesn't really give a damn
A	yeah
B	and one old lady
A	was he alright after that?
B	yeah we put put him on some anticoagulants and you know we did say he he might need to go into a nursing home or something now
A	yeah
B	or go home with carers because
A	yeah
B	because you know he needs helpers and stuff but I don't know I never know what happens to them you don't ever know do you when they leave hospital?
A	that's weird
B	you can do I think
A	why don't you do that? and then you've got your own business then and then you don't have to worry about being sacked
B	yeah
A	no no one's too young to start a business
B	no but I think my generally in my job you need a bit of experience in like
A	oh okay
B	I I do
A	yeah
B	to assess and
A	that's worth thinking about for the future
B	yeah it is yeah and I wouldn't mind doing it privately like my
A	mm that's where you need to save save a bit for a couple of years and then you've got a bit of money
B	and then I think I want to live in the next couple of years like I've missed I've been at uni four years I haven't done anything
A	yeah
B	you know I've been in
A	live
B	yeah
A	yeah I went I've been for one weekend skiing
B	yeah do you wish you'd done it for longer?
A	I think a weekend was enough for me just because it it I was a beginner and like
B	you you didn't really
A	yeah I think if I went on a week's skiing holiday that would be good
B	I mean even on a
B	I can imagine rocking up in to the bar
A	it was fun it's just it is really cold I have to say
A	erm but yeah no it was fun but I'd recommend just to like I would go for a couple more ski weekends first and then to go on a
B	well you didn't do anything like the dry ski slopes or anything did you?
A	no
B	like people here
A	no I just went to the mountains
B	you just went all out and went straight to skiing
A	I went to the mountains I was on the baby slope though which is like that steep
B	that would be enough for me
A	I was with with the two year olds
B	used to probably oh you snow ploughed into these er
A	oh yeah that was on the slightly that was the that was the
B	because they go blue don't they?
A	yeah the well green is lower than blue there's green blue
B	and then black
A	red and black
B	that's it yeah
A	green blue red black
B	they all seem to be very much the same don't they?
A	yeah
B	cos I think
A	oh well I went on the red one accidentally and it was really steep and then when I went on a green one and I was like god this is more my
B	did you go down the red one?
A	yeah
B	did you manage it?
A	not really I couldn't really control myself
A	and that's the one below black
B	yeah
A	it's the
B	oh bless you
B	bless you little ducklings
A	yeah that's what we were like
B	she's
A	so
A	well
B	what even on the green slope?
A	yeah even on the green one
B	you didn't master
A	didn't even master it I kept trying I didn't master it
B	were you on your own then on the green slope in the end or were you with other people?
A	with other people
B	did you have to rent skiing stuff and everything like that?
A	yeah you have to rent the skis
B	was it expensive?
A	I can't remember how much it was really
B	cos erm
A	yeah she's like black slope
B	does she?
A	she got off she's er she's even
B	does she? what
A	mm
B	she just goes anywhere sort of thing?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but she I guess she's quite experienced so she knows
B	she I didn't know that is she still doing PT work by the way?
A	yeah I think so
B	sorry
B	yeah I've got the PT physiotherapist cos we work with PTs don't we? like mostly
A	I guess you do yeah
A	I dunno I guess she could probably work on a ski slope shouldn't shouldn't she?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	on a ski slope hospital
B	oh could you imagine?
A	that would be cool
B	wonder if they do speech and
A	let's yeah cos I don't think people generally
B	stay there no
A	yeah
B	they're just on
A	you could help Michael Schumacher couldn't you? you could go and help Michael Schumacher
B	oh yes and by the sounds of it I can just imagine him being I I can sort of imagine the sort of patient he'd be cos I've worked with lots of them
A	mm
B	not to say he doesn't make progress you know we've got this guy at the moment and he's been in hospital eight months? erm maybe longer than that he got beaten up in a pub
B	erm
A	why do people beat
B	it was like in a fight and
A	oh
B	I think it was over someone tried to hit his wife? I don't I don't know what happened
A	oh for god's sake
B	erm there was like a fight yeah and he got really bad TBI and
A	what's TBI?
B	traumatic brain injury erm he's been tracheostomied he's got a trachy in
A	oh god
B	erm he's off that and everything now
A	was the man arrested who beat him up?
B	he's stimulated yeah he got life
A	oh how did you know he was depressed then?
B	well he had some sort of
A	yeah
B	so we started you know working with him doing the erm
A	oh
B	especially because we was bung the suction tube down his throat
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	does his wife come in and?
B	the wife's really on the ball but we've got to put we were trying to get him to self suction and he got that and everything and then he like when he was self suctioning you get a you then get to realise that you've got feeling and you're very
A	oh that's good
B	yeah
A	so will he like make a full
B	oh my goodness
A	shit
B	are they okay?
A	oh my god
B	where is that is that London?
A	I guess
B	it looked like a
A	well no it's world news so it could be anywhere
B	oh so like a so like a platform but yeah no he's er so we've got him on these antidepressants you know everything he's done is very angry and erm
A	oh that's good
B	to the point there
A	who's
B	she's the band seven erm
A	okay
B	and she's like a few bands above me she's like a good really high band and erm
B	and er he told the nursing staff cos they all change that it was his hoodie and they'd put it on him and he was going
A	oh no
B	and erm yeah so and then they got this massive email about the uniform
A	oh that's so cool
B	he's now going to rehab cos he's got loads of rehab to do
A	so he'll be able to speak and everything normally like
B	I don't think so
A	never be normal again?
B	it'll be quite a it'll be quite a low level
A	oh
B	well women do as well
A	yeah but it's mostly men
B	I don't know
A	just go to the pub and enjoy yourself don't have to beat someone up it used to really annoy me when we'd go out in
B	but they were a bit druggy though weren't they?
A	yeah oh they were just
B	I don't either I don't either
A	oh do you want to stop?
B	yeah
