A	erm I've got my welcome back meeting on the twenty-sixth of September I don't know where I want to go because like they said it was vital last year and it was fucking shit there was no point even going
B	yeah
A	like it's saying this meeting will provide you with important information about the forthcoming academic year therefore it is vital that you attend
B	although second year I guess it might be a little bit more important
A	yeah
B	explaining things well we we're going to be there together we can always just travel up together
A	that's the day before the engagement party yeah we can I'll get
B	how how did you find out about that?
A	I got an email like you want to check your emails cos
A	yeah well
B	if it's not on the same day it'll be slightly more difficult
A	mine's school of English so I I reckon yours will be the same day because that's the day that everyone goes back I think it's the the last day before the new term but
B	okay
A	like he won't mind taking you you might just have to hang around at uni for a few hours extra than if you would have if you got a train
B	yeah obviously if he was if he was taking me then that's not a problem can't wait to just move in though get all my stuff decorate my bedroom
A	when you get when you and
B	yeah that would be really nice actually
A	erm
B	but erm
A	and
B	erm I would actually if you wouldn't mind I'd say wait until we've moved
A	yeah
B	to see what we actually need and like what space there's going to be cos there's five of us and we've all got extra stuff
A	no I mean for our rooms like I want to get some fairy lights I want to get like some nice bedding and stuff like that
B	oh right okay yeah no we can do that yeah definitely I'm going to get another set of bedding as well because two it was like it was alright but as soon as I'd take one off I'd have to wash it so it would be okay
A	yeah yeah but at least this year we get free washing
B	yeah
A	like cos that were really annoying last year having to go all the way downstairs and
B	can't wait to get my special pillow back I didn't really think it through because I bought it with me when we were driving
A	yeah
B	from here to England cos it's like my favourite pillow it's so squishy and lovely
A	yeah
B	erm and I didn't really think it through that I wouldn't have it back in
A	yeah that you can sleep on?
B	yeah
A	well I've got special pillows I think that's why I've got a bad neck because the pillows that I've got are specifically designed for the way that I sleep and I think that's why I've got a bad neck cos I'm
B	sleeping on random pillows
A	yeah a square one that ain't no offence to the
B	no I it took me ages to get rid eh used to the square ones but I've gotten used to them now so like I know that I'll sleep on it for a few nights on one side and then flip it over cos all the squishiness goes up to one side so I just keep flipping it
B	erm
A	everything's alright between me and
B	oh yeah yeah I've noticed it's fine
A	yeah like we talk to each other a lot
B	I think I'm really looking forward to having like our first meal and first drinks all five of us together
A	yeah
B	but also having access to food whenever I want
A	yeah
B	and having free washing
A	yeah
B	just little things that you don't really think are important but I'm really looking forward to
A	yeah
A	I'll tell you what I'm not looking forward to the trek into uni but like I'm quite lucky cos my timetable has been set as I'm in for full days not just an hour here and there so like
B	that's good lucky do you have any days off?
A	yeah two I think or one I think it's one but it depends on cos you don't get your seminars until like
B	till you literally start
A	so my seminars might be on awkward days but if they are then I'm just going to swap them cos I'm not paying bus fare to get in and out when I don't need to when I could be studying at home
B	yeah
A	because they say your degree is full time and you need to do all this studying but like if you're in
B	do all the reading I'm going to set myself what I used to do back when I was boarding I used to set myself an hour per night and even if I didn't have any homework I would just read over my lessons
A	yeah
B	so like an hour per night sometimes it would be more but I'm going to do that this year now
A	did I did I tell you that they've introduced recording of lectures?
B	yeah you mentioned that the other day that's brilliant
A	yeah erm you're not allowed to record in lectures now any more without
B	yeah
A	because last year on a Wednesday morning at ten
B	yeah
A	and erm no actually I did used to go to it I used to go to it every single Wednesday and every single Wednesday she would send an email email out after the lecture saying the lecture hall was empty there was about ten people there and I'm just like well don't fucking hold it on a Wednesday morning then the day after like student night
B	yeah
A	like or pissed on certain student nights
B	especially first years
A	so why would you hold it at ten o'clock on a Wednesday morning like why would you do that? it's just ridiculous but
B	mm
A	I was like if you're going to threaten it do it because then people will be scared
B	yeah that would get them in
A	then that would get them in but like don't just threaten it all year and never do it because people will just think like well you said you were going to do it and you never did it so I'm just going to ignore you next time
B	yeah I need to check my time
A	yeah
B	but there was like
A	but you can email to get them changed them seminars
B	loads of loads of different options for each thing so like it was literally the whole thing was full but when I actually looked at it closer it was like there is actually a lecture slot here but the same one like the same lecture but at a different time
A	yeah
B	so like I don't think that when I looked it was quite early on so I don't think they'd even sorted it out yet
A	yeah no
A	you had that last year didn't you?
B	yeah it was just like there was nothing for us to do in that seminar
A	do you not discuss the last week's stuff?
B	well that's what we started doing because the woman was like this is actually pointless because we're going to be discussing things you haven't even seen in your lecture yet in which case it doesn't really work
A	yeah
B	so instead what she did is for one week she held off the seminars let us catch up a week of lectures and then what we did is on the Monday we would discuss the lecture from last Thursday
A	yeah
B	and stuff like that
A	one of my lectures lecture one is on a Thursday and lecture two is on a Tuesday how the fuck did they work that out?
B	what do you mean?
A	so do you know I have for some of my modules I have two lectures per week
B	yeah
A	so lecture one is on a Thursday but then lecture two is on a Tuesday how the fuck did they work that out? unless we start our first day is on a Thursday and that's why it's lecture one lecture two
B	it's not it's Monday
A	well I don't know why they've done that then it's ridiculous
B	it's weird maybe it will pan itself out
A	oh yeah I've had a I'm really pissed off cos I can't drop literature and just do full language there's no spaces available apparently and erm so I can go to language and linguistics but I don't want to do linguistics I'm going to have to catch up a whole year of fucking shit to do linguistics
B	yeah
A	so it's just like well I don't want to do that
B	maybe literature will be a bit more interesting for you this year though
A	yeah hopefully because I don't want it to affect my degree because I'm not very good at it like that exam mark forty-two percent that were disgusting like all my essays I got sixty-five sixty-seven percent
B	mm
A	so how can they justify giving me forty-two percent in an exam
B	yeah it's not very
A	like how does that work out
B	it's not very fair on you
A	it's like I get sixty-five percent all year sixty-seven percent and then in my exam I get forty-two percent
B	I can't wait to go get my feedback though cos obviously I wasn't there so I don't know what went along with my grades
A	yeah
B	I don't know why it was like that or
A	yeah
B	which is why I think it's silly like when
A	yeah
B	if you don't know what it is specifically that you're doing wrong you'll keep doing it
A	yeah
B	cos you don't realise you're doing it wrong and that's such a bad way of learning
A	yeah it is a terrible cos you're just going to keep making the same mistakes until someone points them out
B	well yeah like people don't learn unless they know it's mistakes and like that's what you're there for you're there to learn how to do it right so like obviously you're going to have bad feedback but that's the point
A	even if it is bad it's constructive like cos you can work on it you can make them skills better
B	exactly what's the point of you turning up and being perfect there's no point going to university if you're perfect
A	no there isn't
