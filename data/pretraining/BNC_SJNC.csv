A	oh wait what?
C	onions
A	yeah

A	so are you going for the nine inch pizzas?
C	yeah well we'll get two of them
A	oh wait yeah wait wait wait wait wait
B	yeah cos we get two and a garlic bread
C	it is January this should be good
A	and you want chips and drink?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	okay that's fine then
C	well we might as well
B	it's cheaper to do it like as the meal deal than get it separately without it
A	well yeah have you seen prices of twelve inch pizzas? but
C	is that normally what you get? oh the amount the amount of pizzas
A	where you get the nine inch pizzas
C	right okay let me it might be cheaper then
B	it's the one with twelve inch pizzas though
B	how much is that?
A	er
C	eighteen fifty
A	eighteen
B	that isn't cheaper is it?
C	what's what's the price of two nine inch pizzas?
A	no
C	one nine inch one
A	so two nine inch pizzas it would be er four ninety and five sixty
C	oh that's not typing four ninety
A	er and then
B	one eighty
A	chips
B	and chips
C	and garlic bread
A	one eighty for the chips er but you get a free nine inch garlic bread they don't tell you how much that is
C	it's that's twelve thirty
A	okay and then the drink
C	well I've got
B	I've got a can of coke
A	yeah I can deal without the drink if we want
C	okay let's do that then
A	er drinks are two pound
B	yeah but we don't need a
C	yeah
B	drink then
C	that's like a pound cheaper
A	shall we do that?
C	yeah
A	okay we want a bigger pizza
C	okay
A	it's alright no it's fine
B	well we can get one twelve inch and one nine inch pizza
C	mm yeah
A	yeah I suppose so how wait how much did it come to you before?
C	er sixteen something
A	what was that for?
C	two twelve inch pizzas one
A	chips
C	garlic bread one chips I think
B	did we put the garlic bread in there?
C	I can't remember
B	wait how much are twelve inch pizzas?
A	oh god six ninety and seven sixty
B	so that's what? six ninety and seven
C	that's like
A	that's like more expensive than the
C	yeah
B	that's like what?
A	shall we just do the nine inch
B	fifteen fifty or something?
C	well we could get one twelve and one nine
A	yeah if you want
C	I can't believe it's this complicated
B	I don't mind what I don't even know what we were talking about between if I'm being honest
B	I don't know what the options are
B	are we getting are we just gonna get the free garlic bread
C	yeah
B	with it? whatever pizzas we get
A	is that what we want to do?
C	yeah I think so
A	cos we don't get cheese with that one
B	it's it's not cheesy garlic bread
C	mm do you want
B	well we could get
A	shall shall we just go for the meal deal one?
B	okay
A	which is thirteen fifty
C	yeah alright okay
B	I think
C	yeah
B	that's like three pizzas then with the garlic bread it's like
A	yeah so
B	two pizzas
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and a garlic bread and chips
A	yeah yeah
B	so I think that'll be alright
C	thirteen fifty
A	do that can we put cheese on the chips?
B	yeah
C	I've got cheese
A	I've got cheese as well do you want?
C	er that's four fifty each
A	yeah I can deal with that
C	yeah
B	do you want me to erm ring up and order it?
C	yes please
B	what pizzas are we getting?
C	chicken and sweetcorn and the
A	Caribbean barbeque or something? yeah Caribbean barbeque twist I'm just saying though that's only one fifty each difference between the five inch pizzas
C	is it?
A	yeah well cos if it's eighteen pound between three of us that makes it six
C	yeah six minus four fifty is only one fifty
A	yeah
C	oh I don't know
A	and you get a bigger garlic bread
C	oh god
B	what do you want? so you don't want that one anymore?
A	I don't know
C	one cheese garlic bread one chicken and sweetcorn one Caribbean thingy
B	barbeque twist
C	barbeque twist one chips and one
A	you get double chips with the bigger one as well
C	oh do you?
A	yeah
C	oh yeah cos we did last time
A	we got two chips
C	we got onion rings and two chips
B	wait so this is this is a meal deal for three we get two twelve inch pizzas
A	yeah
B	two chips a garlic bread
A	well what I'm I'm just thinking that
B	a garlic bread onion rings
A	that fed us all twice last time and it was only one pound fifty
B	that's true
A	more
C	each
B	that is true that is true
A	so I'm just wondering whether it would be just as well to do that one and then just
C	yeah and have it tomorrow as well yeah yeah I like that idea
A	okay
C	let's do that
C	what drink are we gonna get? you can have can we do Fanta?
A	yeah
A	erm
C	I don't like this
B	why?

A	I scared
B	I'm just gonna put it on speaker
C	well that one's a bit ridgy as well I honestly don't know what this is for
A	okay go for it
B	just because I can't hear very well
A	you know
C	did you have a hearing test?
A	no
B	no I need to go back and get one he gave me drops
A	oh for your wax?
B	yeah but that's not what it is
A	yeah er did you get go to Specsavers? oh you
C	I'm gonna die
A	does anybody have cash by the way? I think I do but

A	well I've been sat here like I should go and do work and then
E	work?
A	yeah
E	what work do you have to do?
A	I have to finish the relativity sheet
E	oh yeah I
A	which you have to help me with
E	I no cos I literally just helped
A	well that's not my fault
E	you stole my space
A	you did say you were happy to sit there
E	yeah true
C	that's such a creepy look
B	yeah I know
C	that is really creepy
E	I don't even know if I've done it right though
C	this one's mouldy as well
B	it's mouldy?
C	yeah
B	no
A	I just don't know how to draw erm diagrams I think I've done everything else
E	yeah
A	it's the
E	basically C you have to do to draw B so C we think is just the calculation you do so that you can draw B
A	but I just need to see like
A	what you've done cos I have no idea where to start with it so
B	what?
A	erm
unknown_female	mm
A	yeah and I need to split my code
E	oh
A	and do my reading file I still don't know what I'm gonna write in the report either
B	I think you should start recording
C	it is recording
B	I was just
E	not have you started writing it?
A	yeah I've done
unknown_female	oh good
A	I've done my introduction and my code design and I've made a film and I've done all my
E	that's the bit that takes ages
A	it's just
E	okay
A	I analysed the energy and the frame period and
E	from well I realise now that there's like an equation but I did it from the energy cos from the my energy oscillation is really weird cos there's only three bodies
A	okay
E	so but that's got a period like the oscillation
unknown_female	mm
A	okay cos my period oscillation varies depending on what my size of delta T is and how often I print data
E	yeah okay
A	yeah
E	oh yeah I don't know yeah
A	yeah I was gonna do energy and how how that changes with respect to
E	oh
A	delta two
unknown_female	yeah
B	that one I think it might
C	well I'm doing this like reading challenge I've set myself a reading challenge I found one online and one of them is
B	Elizabeth is Missing?
C	er
B	oh
C	mm
B	The Girl on the Train was really good
C	I've read er
C	oh I can read about blood I just can't watch it
B	watch it
C	yeah like I'm fine with Game of Thrones the book
A	you dealt with my hand pretty well
C	yeah I feel like in real life I can deal with it it's just on screen
A	mm
E	that's backwards that though
C	I mean if someone was like
B	yeah that is backwards
E	I can deal with stuff on the screen but if it's like a pair of lungs in front of me in real life I will run away
C	well I mean yeah if there was like someone and like
B	when have you ever seen a pair of lungs?
E	in biology in biology
B	yeah I had to do that
C	and we did it
B	no we did heart
E	yeah we we had a heart it was amazing
C	my teacher
B	yeah we had a sardine
C	like picked up the sheep's
C	like lungs and stuff and was blowing into them
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	with like
E	no I had to leave at that point
E	yeah
B	did you?
E	and he had like blood round his mouth
B	yeah but that's not
E	that's weird that's weird
B	everyone was meant to bring like a chicken heart or no pig's heart
A	yeah
B	but the butcher
B	only had an ox heart so I took in an ox heart and
B	it was literally it was this big
A	chicken hearts would be tiny
B	and I got it out no it wasn't it was erm pig hearts
A	I was gonna say cos I think these were
B	which are this big
A	lamb ones or something
B	my ox heart was this big
A	yeah but it's easier to see everything
B	yeah it was great
B	except no there was a guy there was a guy that was really weird and he like sat near me in biology and he came up and he was stroking it and he was like you're okay now it's like
B	if anyone's gonna be a serial killer it's gonna be him
C	that's creepy
A	creepy
E	so creepy
B	so creepy
C	oh my god
E	oh dear
A	we did the er we did sardines and my friend
B	sardines are small aren't they though?
A	they're like this big I think I don't I don't
C	don't but you can get them in tins
B	tins yeah
C	yeah but that
E	yeah
C	like that sardine
A	oh I don't know maybe you can get different sized sardines
B	no yeah they are chopped up in tins
E	I think I'm thinking of anchovies which are like
A	anchovies are little
E	they're little
A	I don't like either though so er just the thought of eating sardines with all the bones
C	oh
A	like it's when the people like but no they're just small and they just crunch it's like oh
B	oh no no
B	we used to give them like put sardines in my dog's breakfast like make his joints better cos he had arthritis
C	ah
B	I didn't realise people ate them
B	I thought it was just pets
C	just for dogs
B	I thought they were just for pet food
B	I didn't realise people ate them I was like that's grim
A	my mum went to the fishmonger's once and er cos we were having a barbeque and she wanted to buy some fish and she was like oh yeah we want some without bones and get came back they were the boniest things ever I think they were literally like
B	oh
A	I don't even know
B	that I do recognise the name but I think it's from a character on a
C	are you thinking of Scrat from Ice Age?
B	no sprat is like a
C	oh
B	I don't know it's a character in a film I think
C	I don't know if it was a fish
A	maybe not but erm and they yeah and they were full of those I can't oh yeah but with when we were dissecting
A	the sardine erm you could like it was you could like dissect the eye and
D	oh
A	found the little lens and it's really weird
C	oh
B	oh gross
A	no it wasn't that bad
B	that's interesting though
A	yeah
E	yeah I
A	I didn't like biology though
C	it's just
A	it's just so boring
A	oh sorry
C	and now
B	oh it's from Downton Abbey
C	oh
A	my cousin's friend's brother got a needle stuck in his eye
C	oh
A	oh god
C	oh
A	it was like my
B	I was gonna say it doesn't sound funny
unknown_female	it's hilarious
B	at all
A	my grandma er has like really bad vision and so she has to have injections in her eyes which sounds disgusting but every time my mum like it's mentioned round my mum my mum just goes
C	mm I hate eyes
A	yeah
C	anything
A	yeah
C	to do with eyes I
B	I can touch my eye with my finger
A	that's not good you shouldn't
B	why? yeah but
C	put germs in it
B	I don't do it but I can
C	yeah
A	I can but only cos I learnt to put contacts in
E	well like if I've got an eyelash in my eye I'll
B	yeah
C	yeah
E	but only if absolutely necessary
B	I need to get contact lenses
C	you need to
B	I maybe just
A	are contact lenses made of plastic now?
E	yeah they're like
A	what were they used be made out of?
E	cellophane like glass used to be made out of the glass but the yeah like
C	is that what they made lenses out of?
E	plasticy sillicony stuff
B	my god that is gross
C	yeah
B	how long were
E	oh ages
B	I was gonna say since like nineteen eighty or something
A	probably longer
E	I think so yeah
B	yeah yeah that's fine
A	like you'll never have had glass ones
B	I was like meant now like they've recently just got changed from glass
A	oh no
B	I was like
A	no no
B	oh
C	do you have contact lenses?
B	into your eye though? what?
C	do you
B	no
C	oh
E	she just can't see
B	I need to get them
B	I wear glasses
C	er yeah I knew you I knew you
B	but I need to go and get contacts
E	and then you can see all the time
B	yeah yeah that's that's the one
A	I think like it's less effort to just wear glasses I need to go and get my eyes tested actually
B	no it's not it's not less effort to wear glasses cos glasses
E	if you if you just like put your contacts in in the morning they're just like
B	my glasses
E	that'll be all day
B	I've worn my glasses for a long time like they made my nose feel funny
E	are they too heavy? you need to get lighter glasses
B	I don't know but they like they sit here and then sometimes I'm like it just makes it feel funny I don't like it
E	yeah they're just too heavy and they like mark your nose
B	yeah yeah they do
E	yeah
B	that
A	they do it just to here or is it just here?
B	they don't dig in they just
E	get some like
B	they don't dig in you
C	yeah I know
C	you should get one of those chains that like like grannies wear
B	yeah
B	oh yeah
B	my mum has like trifocal glasses so she can like just see everything she needs them for everything and she never wears them she can't read things close she can't see things far away and she can't see things normally she just
B	well she doesn't
E	she just can't see anything ever
B	but she doesn't wear her glasses and I've like why?
A	my mum has
A	varifocals now and she doesn't like them cos she she was
C	yeah
A	like cos my mum's eyes are really bad
C	oh on like I thought you meant like on a like an Ipad
A	what what what does that say
B	oh
A	on my tablet?
B	no yeah I did that but that's cos we were
C	yeah
B	talking about it earlier
A	no
B	about tablets
A	er pills
C	yeah
E	yeah
A	erm and like she sometimes it makes her feel dizzy cos she moves her eyes instead of her head cos it depends on which bit of the glasses you look through as to what
E	okay yeah
A	the strength is
C	yeah
A	it's like to do this was like look from your face to your feet she'd have to move her head rather than her eyes and it makes her dizzy
C	yeah
A	sometimes so she wants to get some single vision ones
C	yeah my mum doesn't like her bifocals
A	mm
A	I dunno I just really don't want glasses
B	do you need them?
E	embrace the glasses
A	I don't think so I need to go and get my eyes tested though just to check
B	I was like I don't want glasses but then were like just makes life easier but I wore contacts
A	well if you can't see obviously
C	mm
B	yeah but erm I want contacts cos I don't like wearing them all the time
C	mm
B	for long periods of time so
A	I'm so hungry
C	I know
B	I know I'm hungry now
C	I'm so disappointed about the cake oh my god
A	and
C	yeah
A	oh
C	they were both mouldy
E	why are there mouldy cakes? did you leave them here?
C	yeah I got them
E	oh
B	we called them
E	well what was the date on them?
B	like
C	November
B	twenty minutes ago
E	oh oh so they're like halfway there
B	unless
A	what he said was half an hour forty to fifty minutes
C	that's quite a wide
E	so he started optimistic and then he was like wait no
A	to be fair we do that in the pharmacy it's like we'll be like oh yeah it'll probably be a little while it'll be like mm
E	but we had a long day
A	what yeah I've been up since eight
E	oh my god eight
C	same
A	yeah I've done an hour and a quarter of exercise thank you very much
E	yeah
E	I've been sewing today
A	I've been injured
B	sewing?
E	I've done like an hour of exercise
C	sewing
C	oh which is
C	I don't think that
B	that's not really exercise
B	with your fingers
A	I'm planning on like start starting going swimming again more often
C	right
A	cos I've only used my gym membership four times
B	I wanna go to do play badminton
C	yeah
A	we should go yeah
C	let's play badminton
A	yeah
E	what's that?
C	er badminton
E	yeah it's
B	I might pop into
A	that's like yeah if I actually try and start using the gym membership cos
B	yeah
C	well since you're paying like
A	yeah
E	but it was quite good today I thought it was gonna be like four quid or something cos it was but I don't know when the peak times are but it was only two fifty-five so for some reason it wasn't
A	maybe that's cos it's holidays still
E	but
B	but but I was gonna say
E	maybe
B	maybe it's cos term's not started
A	it's not term time
E	yeah
A	but that's weird cos normally the whole of weekend is peak
E	yeah well that's what I thought I was sure it was gonna be really expensive
B	which probably cos it's out of term time
A	unless they charge you like child price
E	no cos I asked for a student or a normal or something
B	well why? you should have just asked for a child
E	well cos I'm clearly not a child
B	you say clearly
B	but that's not
A	you did walk into that one
E	yeah yeah
B	depends if a child's classed as fourteen or under I think you could get away with being a child
E	yeah it depends where
B	if it's twelve you might it might depend on the person
E	twelve I can't do twelve
B	but fourteen I reckon you could get away with that
A	if you take your glasses off
E	do I look younger without them?
B	no you look younger with them on
A	do you think?
B	yeah
A	and it's like if you put your hair on your face and then they just won't be able to see
B	no you definitely look
E	I'm like twelve
B	no you definitely look younger with them on
A	but it doesn't help that you
E	that's true
B	yeah you'd have to take that off obviously
E	yeah but I had my coat on top when I walked in
A	well just strip then they'll let you in
E	how will that work?
B	this is how
B	extra extra perks at the gym
E	how is this gonna help me?
A	you don't know what they're they're inclined
B	that's a very good point
E	yeah but one of them's like forty
A	and?
B	so?
E	pervy old woman at the desk
B	okay maybe don't think that maybe go with child or take your pants off I think that mixture might
B	might not do the
E	oh my god
A	mm
E	what did you do?
A	yeah I think they're in my drawer I got
E	oh
B	do you know what would help?
A	what?
B	alcohol
A	probably
E	yeah
A	but I have to get up a six tomorrow so I don't think yeah
E	six? oh
A	yeah what time's the worksheet due in?
E	I have no idea
A	cos you could just help me tomorrow morning instead and then you won't have just helped
B	I might wake up at six tomorrow to get more work done
E	I'll wake you up
C	please go and like actually go to her room
E	oh yeah
C	and don't just shout up the stairs
E	she doesn't hear me if I shout up the stairs I've tried in the past
C	mm
B	have you?
E	it's too far away
A	yeah well obviously you didn't do it
A	oh
C	yeah there's too many
A	well I'd hope you can hear yourself laugh

B	erm well so we should get
A	do we have onions?
B	like a bottle of wine or Prosecco
C	what do you use onions for
B	no?
C	in a roast dinner?
B	gravy
A	stuffing
A	gravy
C	oh just buy readymade stuffing
E	you're making stuffing? just buy a packet
A	well I'm not making anything
A	cos I'm stuck sitting next to
B	oh we're not making
E	oh yeah no this is why we're not doing it cos
B	we're not making stuffing that's too much effort we'll buy a packet yeah
A	erm or you could just do like roast onions cos they're good
B	we could put it in the gravy but it's a lot of effort
E	yeah
B	well never have
E	well we have them anyway so
C	we have them
B	yeah I've got an onion if we want it
A	you've got an onion?
B	yeah
E	only one
B	just in case
B	an onion for emergencies
E	there were some onions on the side that were growing they were fine
E	I don't know whose they are
B	it's like potatoes onions are like potatoes
B	yeah
A	yeah I
B	yeah no I tell well
E	you were talking about a melon
B	I was I was gonna do it all
A	yeah that's still in the box and I didn't wanna open it
B	I was gonna do it all before I left
E	oh
B	and I forgot but then I came back up for a book so I like went through the fridge and chucked away everything that was mouldy and and like on the sides and everything
A	yeah I like I was having these revelations I only realised like two weeks ago that I'd left my eggs
B	yeah
A	melon on the side which I really need to empty cos it's disgusting and then like two weeks
B	oh yeah
A	into the holidays I had this realisation that I had biscuits it's like I really want a biscuit and then I dunno I it's like I had an open packet of malted milks in the cupboard
B	are they okay?
A	I don't know
B	they might be okay
B	they might be okay
A	they'll have all gone soggy
E	no they'll have gone all fusty and like soft
A	fusty?
C	well the the top ones might
E	yeah they go fusty but the
B	but the ones underneath it it's airtight
E	really? I'll have a look
B	them erm bananas were gross
E	oh
B	they were literally all black and they had green fur coming out of them
D	oh
A	see this is another thing is if we shop together we won't end up with like three bunches of bananas
E	yeah
B	yes
C	cos I was gonna buy some in Sainsbury's the other day but they were like eight in a bunch and I was like I'm not gonna eat
A	yeah
C	eight bananas
A	uhu
A	exactly
B	and stuff like meat like
C	uhu
B	they come in big packets it's easier to buy
E	yeah
B	a pack and then we've just like got one to fit in
C	yeah
B	the freezer yeah
A	yeah in the freezer yeah
C	yeah
B	or the fridge stuff like that is easier
A	yeah
E	and like stuff with a short date we can just eat it
B	yeah
A	oh and there's a squash on the bench but it's staying on the bench cos it apparently doesn't need to go in the fridge
B	okay
C	what's that?
A	a butternut squash
C	yeah okay
A	erm
E	yeah
A	the last couple of times I've had carrots they've gone off really quickly even if I put them in the fridge
E	cos it's quite warm in the house yeah
A	yeah but if they're in the fridge
E	yeah I don't know why they've gone off maybe you're just buying bad carrots
B	what are bad carrots?
A	well I should probably find some money actually
E	apparently once they've gone bendy she sounded like
B	yeah but I've never had a bendy what's a bendy carrot? carrots just snap
E	no no like yeah but like if they go off they
A	what?
E	they go bendy
B	oh
C	carrots? yeah
A	yeah they go like rubbery
E	they go like
B	oh we always
E	all like
B	eat them before they go off
A	oh
E	good for you
E	with your large carrot assumption
A	I might actually have change five
A	what?
C	you know like you look like the cookie monster?
B	except it's money and you've
B	it's really you look nothing like the cookie monster
E	you just look like a monster
B	your hair looks nice
A	thank you I'm thinking about growing my fringe out
B	oh
A	cos it's like if you
C	bit scary
A	it's been annoying me for a while and apparently it's easier to cut one in than it is to grow it out so I think if I grow it out and then don't like it I can just get it cut back in
B	yeah
C	that's a good
E	where are you gonna part your hair though?
A	side
E	oh side like oh yeah cos then you'll just get a
A	exactly
E	side fridge
A	yeah and then it'll grow out
E	and that'll grow out yeah
A	cos I feel like I it like it works on you but I feel like if I had er curtains it would just look weird
E	yeah
A	cos like my fringe isn't long enough
E	well my curtains are are separated by my glasses
A	yeah
A	and it's like it cos I think I dunno it's just not as noticeable on you
E	mm like
B	I mean I got a middle parting it done for my hair and it looks terrible and I really regret it I wish I'd done a side one
A	see I don't really have a parting
E	yeah yours just kind of comes from the middle there
A	it just kind of starts there
B	yeah
A	like and I sometimes try and part it and it doesn't do but the last couple of days cos my
C	yeah
A	and then if I don't like it I can just grow it out
B	yeah
C	erm I have
A	that's not what I meant and then I could get it cut back in
C	yeah
B	have you got change? er well I've got exact change is all on the table there so
C	I've got yeah I've got exact change or I can give someone a ten pound note and
A	well we have exact change here so
B	yeah
C	okay fine
E	what are you getting?
D	pizza
E	oh
C	I don't want to use that pound actually
A	they're changing
A	the pound coin aren't they?
C	sorry?
A	they're changing it
C	are they?
B	gonna be yeah
A	it's gonna be twelve sided
E	oh my god
C	twelve sided?
B	why?
A	cos apparently these ones are too easy easy to forge apparently like one in five or something ridiculous is a forgery? a fake so they're changing them
E	what are the keeping like fat and gold?
C	well you know like the fifty P it's like got more
B	skinny and silver
C	thin and silver
E	no
C	it was
E	if they
A	I don't know
E	although I guess the two pound coin's quite heavy
A	it depends on the density
E	yeah
C	they might change it
B	they may not have real gold though
E	well no
E	gold coin
A	it would be slightly more than a pound
B	be probably heavier is gold heavy or light?
E	mm
C	I don't know
A	dunno
E	I don't know I've never had a large amount of gold to hold
C	and?
B	so you should know from the make of the gold
E	why would I know the density of gold?
E	off the top of my head? I don't know what
B	because you know cos you know the atomic that like numbers of it you know how it's made up so that should tell how
A	no no no
B	heavy it is though
A	no I know the symbols AU but I don't know any of the numbers
E	is it like seventy-nine or something?
A	don't know it's quite far down isn't it?
E	yeah I don't know
A	that means silver?
C	yeah
E	yeah
A	I don't I don't know what these are made of either
E	I don't know
B	I assume like copper and covered in gold but I don't know probably just be
C	they're
E	yeah
A	yeah
C	steal copper
B	yeah yeah true
C	churches
A	it's illegal to melt down coins though
B	yeah but with jewellery erm jewellery's copper and then like covered
C	I don't yeah I don't know how
A	but to but to get a lot of copper wiring it's worth quite a lot of money
B	yeah I know what sort of
A	like copper heating tanks and stuff
B	there are
A	yeah
B	you
C	yeah they steal it from churches as well
A	church roofs and stuff
C	yeah
A	mm
C	that's just weird
B	why is copper on roofs?
A	I don't know
C	cos it goes green and it's funny
A	yeah but
C	yeah
A	you know like
C	the
E	on wait
A	no not not the

C	the
B	yeah
E	yeah you're thinking of something else
C	I don't know
E	I don't I don't know what it's called
A	I'm thinking of like what else where else is green?
E	erm
A	what else is green?
C	like the Statue of Liberty's green
A	the Statue of Liberty is green
A	yeah
B	yeah but that's not copper
A	yes it is
E	yeah it's copper
B	is it?
A	yes it was initially brown
E	isn't the statue of queen
C	yeah maybe
A	it's like
E	in dark green? but
E	yeah so that
E	yeah isn't that copper? cos
A	I don't know
E	that's green
A	most things look green that's copper
E	I can't remember which one it is two or three
A	no copper one is black
E	yeah I think
A	don't know
B	but if you burn copper in a flame it's not green is it? isn't
A	yeah
E	can't remember
A	well maybe that's if you burn copper oxide
B	oh
A	don't know to be honest
E	I feel like that's red
C	it's Lic but I can't remember what the CK stands for or what the C stands for
E	Lic?
C	yeah that's how we learnt it it was like lithium LIC but I can't remember what the C stands for
