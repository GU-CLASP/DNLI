D	it didn't work?
D	so I can book it online if you want?
C	oh you have one? oh yeah yeah yeah you should do that
D	okay

D	mm interesting I closed my Facebook account
C	oh have you used Airbnb before though?
D	I've got an app though yeah
B	yeah
C	oh then that's fine if you've used it
C	yeah and he kept doing this thing where you accept the wrong days he said I can't change the days I said leave it for one day twenty-four hours it'll expire I'll do it with the right days and just before it did it he reaffirmed it and it's it's been this ongoing thing he doesn't quite understand
D	so
C	but he's like don't worry there's gonna be someone to meet you he said this is my number and it blocks numbers er you can't send a mobile number in a message
C	cos it just gives you the letters
D	so now what should I do?
D	I'm lost
