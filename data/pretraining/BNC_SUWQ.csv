A	yeah yeah god like what
B	well yeah we did
C	well we did good job we did
B	we did because we couldn't get couldn't get it to go in you know
A	yeah yeah
B	so we thought well we need to give ourselves plenty of time
A	and you did
B	and we did
A	thankfully you spotted the person with the licence plate
C	he
B	pulled right behind a GB licence plate and er and they said you know cos we cos I put in home on the that satnav and it said do you want this to include the ferries? so we said yes and thought oh this is this'll be fine you know we just
A	oh so it was taking you to France
B	yeah
A	but Calais
B	Calais
C	the wrong one
B	yeah
A	ah
B	and this was with a setting for home you know so I was
A	yeah oh so it was just taking you to the nearest quickest route to get home
B	yeah
A	Calais not Dunkirk
B	well
A	well whatever's most common maybe
B	yeah and we wasn't sure what if you know going towards Calais was still gonna take us towards Dunkirk
A	mm
B	so we pulled into a garage right behind a GB plate
B	and they said yeah they said you'll see Dunkirk in a very shortly to begin with next signpost said Dunkirk on it as well didn't it?
A	but you got into
B	no we we saw a ferry and
B	well we saw a car ferry to begin with
C	yeah and then it went
B	and then it went and it just said port so we followed port and
C	and we ended up in a village about sixty miles out of the place
B	oh we don't know where that was taking us
A	no
B	obviously weren't the port for the car ferry so then we come
A	yeah yeah
B	and pulled over and over the road was another GB number plate
A	oh right oh so you saw them twice then?
B	no different people
C	different one
A	no yeah but you saw a GB twice and they're ones that led you to the
B	we followed them
B	we followed but they cos they're they're
B	then because I'm
C	Belgium
A	Belgium yeah now you were back in France
A	yeah yeah used to
B	come under France
A	in Belgium
C	where where
B	but these people that we followed they were supposed to have been on the four o'clock ferry and they missed that
A	oh so they were lost as well? were they just running late?
B	well no they weren't lost they just didn't give themselves enough time
A	does it matter? do you have to pay again or
C	nah
B	nah
A	no cos there's enough room on it isn't there?
B	yeah they just get you on the next one which
A	oh right
B	cos it was out it was just just turned four o'clock when we got there wasn't it?
C	yeah
B	course it was too late for them to go get onto it it was still there but it was too late for them to get on it
A	oh for them to board on yeah cos obviously once they put up the thing and
A	quite a procedure at sea I think
B	so we had a couple of hours wait then didn't we?
C	yeah
A	what did you do?
B	sat in the car
C	sat in the car had a drink and then
B	had a coffee
C	whatever
B	dad dozed off
A	oh did he?
B	I reckon the
A	you can't miss your afternoon snooze can you? you two are funny
B	I read my book
C	I sat there
B	mind you we were up early that morning
A	yeah what time did you get up? dad what time did he have you up at that boot fair
B	about half six
A	it was big though wasn't it?
B	it was huge
A	yeah dad said you could spend two days going around it
C	so I mean I loved it but
A	hot that day too
C	it was so hot
A	yeah
C	my
A	yeah
C	it was aching all over
A	after days of walking
B	it was my calves standing
C	mum mum's back
A	yeah
C	my leg and my neck and my bloody
A	you can see why travelling keeps you trim can't you?
A	can you imagine me and
B	ah and we was only walking really slowly
A	yeah it went well stick a couple of mountains and some steps and hills and things in there probably we'll never be that fit again
B	and the first day when we went into Antwerp we found erm a little supermarket which was where dad found that red label
A	oh yeah nice and cheap
B	so we bought
A	how much was it? do you
B	ten ten euros
A	ten euros
B	no no it wasn't it was about eleven
C	weren't no more than eleven
A	so about ten pounds ten more than ten pounds then
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	whatever free
B	so yeah
A	yeah
B	but we was miles along from the erm
A	the guest house
B	yeah
B	so we got that we got some milk I bought a bottle of wine and a couple of other nibbles course I ended up carrying all of that
A	ah it's alright when you've got a backpack
B	yeah
A	it's a bit annoying when you've got to carry it round with you
B	it was two bags
A	yeah
C	went out and had a burger the first night didn't we?
B	yeah
A	yeah the food sounded like a success everywhere you went
C	we was we was the oldest people in the place
A	oh were you?
C	yeah
C	they was all all all students
A	oh was it? right
B	to begin with they put it by the door
C	they moved us
A	ah
B	they moved us cos of the door
B	oh everybody was really friendly
A	yeah I
B	everybody
A	I think I I don't think you'll find that in France in France the French are a bit more standoffish no you wouldn't find it in France
C	not France itself
B	oh you wouldn't find it France?
A	no
B	oh
A	I don't think it'd be quite because Belgium's a much smaller country and I think they are they are
C	it was a bloody nice burger and all weren't it?
A	you know they don't have any issues or anything with anyone that can be quite nice but I think the French can be a little bit more standoffish in touristy places
C	oh
A	maybe not er to you two cos you're an older couple
A	or wherever you would go but I don't think I wouldn't I think Belgium's probably in hindsight quite a good place to start I do think their reputation for just being really nice and having a nice standard just a nice country in general
B	yeah it was it was so clean wasn't it?
C	yeah
B	ever such a lot of cyclists as well
A	oh yeah yeah
C	oh they
A	yeah those Europeans
C	and the
A	cycling until their old age
B	yeah
A	like nothing yeah
C	the size of the bikes jesus
A	yeah
C	huge bloody things
B	lots of them places where you can hire bikes as well
A	yeah yeah yeah you
C	hundreds and hundreds of them
A	ah it's a much nicer way to be isn't it? I mean we've got a lot
C	the road was all flat weren't it?
A	yeah
B	just level
A	but even so if people did it a bit more than standard here
B	Boris has tried to introduce it in London hasn't he? these bikes but
A	yeah just to get some poll voting probably
B	but I don't know how successful it's been up there
A	no I mean I've seen the hire bikes hiring bikes in London and they're really expensive and if you go over it starts charging you a certain amount per twenty minutes
C	yeah yeah
A	or something you have to put in your bank details it's something like five pounds for a couple of hours and then every hour after that they try to
A	yeah yeah if you go over you get a hundred pound fine and all this I wouldn't touch them
C	and we had a
A	cos I think in Europe that's probably to stick a few dollars a few euros in and go
C	yeah well I mean we parked right in Bruges is it Bruges we
A	yeah
C	it never cost a penny did it?
B	no
A	no dad said nice the disabled badge works in Europe
C	it never cost us a penny all the others are putting euros
A	yeah cos parking's not cheap
B	oh well the first the first day we went to Bruges we parked in the erm car park at the bus
C	where all the police
B	it's a huge international train station
C	oh massive
B	and we went
A	where was this sorry in
B	Bruges
C	Bruges
A	in Bruges?
B	and we actually went into the underground car park
C	where all the police vehicles are parked
B	yeah and we thought ah when we come out cos we saw another big car park there as well where we could have gone in which was about three euros for all day and included a bus bus ticket to on
A	oh right like a
C	yeah
A	park and ride
C	yeah a park and ride
B	yeah well
C	yeah we was in the posh one weren't we?
B	and we thought oh my god it's gonna cost a fortune parking in that one but when we got back it was only six
C	six euros
B	six euros
C	all day yeah and the
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's nice isn't it?
C	and we
B	so they don't overcharge in park for parking either
A	no
B	look at it here
A	I mean here it's
B	yeah
A	well yeah
C	rip off rip off Brighton
A	what just being an absolute con?

A	no no
B	Blackberry

B	but I think some
C	put it on try it
B	probably somebody got it as a contract
A	oh yeah oh yeah and then just didn't use it
B	and they didn't need it they just wanted the contract probably without the phone
C	yeah so put your SIM card in it
A	gotta be careful though this isn't wi-fi enabled and that can't be charging
C	got
B	you'd be able to go on the wi-fi indoors won't you on it?

B	well yeah if it if it's a bad signal
A	if it's a bad signal but then it's always says it's got signal it never the signal never goes it just doesn't do whatever it's meant to

B	taking cars
A	oh yeah
B	you know that have parked there so I I went in and said you know how
A	what time did you arrive? do you remember?
B	I can't really no
A	cos they never replied to my email and I'm wondering if they had received it before you arrived or not cos I emailed them about one o'clock
C	three o'clock we got there
B	yeah it was after
A	did they seem like they knew that you were coming or
C	well they did but they never checked the book
B	they didn't check the booking when I first arrived there
A	okay
B	she just told give me a ticket and told me how to get into the car park
A	okay
B	which you had to go out and round
C	yeah
B	the next road down and down so we done that and that so like carrying all the luggage up the stairs
C	thinking about it weren't getting it done
A	you told me about the tunnel you got intimate with that tunnel
C	I should have stopped and like backing up from here to there and I could back up that little bit and go
A	yeah
C	and then we come back went through the tunnel again
A	again
B	no
C	two times we done it
B	yeah well we done it we done it the first day we got there
C	and the second day
B	and we done it on the day when we
C	went to park
B	but we didn't do it again after that
C	no cos the next time we come home through the tunnel
B	yeah so we only done it twice
C	yeah well it went through three times all together
A	anyway so they didn't realise you didn't mention to the when you checked in that you weren't kidding
C	no she said sorry afterwards didn't she?
A	yeah
B	cos then when we got up to the desk with all our luggage in the car park downstairs and they took my name they realised then
A	ah

C	telephone in the shower
B	yes
C	telephone by the bed
A	in case you get drunk and start pressing buttons
C	cos when we first went there they give you a card to click in fifteen minutes later me and mum are still out there

A	oh don't the times
A	yeah oh right well
B	I think we were trying to I mean we were trying to we were trying to do it all ways but we was doing it
A	too quick yeah yeah there's always a knack and you always feel like such a plonker cos they do it first time
C	so I had to go and get the girl
A	and then and then you do it wrong again and then you persevere cos you know it does work
C	and then she come over and went that's it oh god I'm gonna throw up
A	no don't worry about that
B	I'm sure we're not the only ones
A	no no no the especially swipe cards and stuff usually they should really take you and show you what to do with it
B	yeah
A	some places do that
C	then we come out and had to go back for the card
B	then the what?
