B	erm who won sexiest
A	yeah
B	and he dressed as erm Miss Piggy
B	and he is er six foot seven
A	awesome
B	erm
B	and the
A	mm
A	and what did he
B	oh it was horrible it was creepy he went as a cow
A	is that because his girl well his
B	yeah cos we were
B	he was kind of like weirdly avoiding me all night erm
B	obviously
A	make
B	erm I dunno well
B	well no he didn't invite me
A	oh she did
B	I was about to buy yeah she invited me
A	well obviously then she can't reject you just because
B	yeah yeah but erm then we were sitting outside and I was like oh like like in the during the week he was messaging me like all the way up until the party and I was just like well you can't really be
A	mm
B	and literally the moment I left
B	all
A	all night
B	evening like
A	that is a bit creepy
B	I was like I've proved my point I was hotter than the girl you're sleeping with high five me I had a better looking man on my arm high five me and boom you broke up
B	I know I was like I feel mean
A	I bet at that point I was like I've I've I've lost I've lost the point of why you were saying lol
A	also there is a place near here on the map called
B	oh is there? I bet er I wonder if that's full of
B	I wonder if that's full of lolz
B	but how are you? how is life with you?
A	yeah it's alright it's just been really like overwhelming and non stop at the moment
B	yeah
A	so they've changed my job so I'm looking after
B	okay
A	history and geography now
B	yeah
A	but that's because they want my strategic brain on things
B	you do have a good strategic brain
A	to say that that's kind of what they'll use to get me promoted next year
B	yeah
A	cos obviously I had to tell them about the interview because there was a travel ban
B	yeah
A	and me having to say I need to be in
B	oh so you cos obviously for any other job you would've had to pay yourself but
A	because I was down in
B	ah
A	so I stayed and to be honest I was doing work
A	for meetings like
B	yeah
A	and in the end it turns out that you know regardless of whether I get the job or not I'm still working in geography I'm working on the
B	yeah
A	I'll work with whoever gets the job so actually all the stuff that I've done is research
B	yeah
A	so and then I did say to them I you know do you want me to take the time off? I think I need to take half a day a day or whatever I don't mind
B	yeah they shouldn't though should they?
A	but they didn't say anything about it but like they were
B	oh yeah
A	so it was the person who's kind of not my manager but the manager above that
B	yeah
B	oh right
A	it's all going down
B	all going down
A	erm it's all going down but
B	yeah
A	cos that's what they told me but it's like seeing er it's it's seeing the strategy and the campaign through
B	yeah
A	and it's not the
B	ah okay
A	so it's kind of like well that
B	yeah
B	yeah course yeah
A	so yeah but I talked to
B	yeah
A	I remember thinking that when you you know when you
B	I think loads of people have said that about you
A	yeah quite a lot well everybody like obviously I wasn't shouting it from the rooftops
B	no but
A	but it was the kind of thing like everybody
A	yeah but everybody's been positive
B	yeah
A	about it and got
A	yeah but my science
B	ah that's good
A	and and she was the one pushing me to be like she was basically like
B	yeah
A	so originally the jobs were only BTEC roles so I was a bit
B	yeah
A	but
A	he was the one hiring for them so I got in touch with him to say that this is the
B	yeah
A	he was like but you know I'm a great admirer of the work that you do
B	oh that's cool
A	erm
B	cos that's all you can do is just make connections and meet these people isn't it?
A	yeah exactly cos he already knows me from working on the science
B	mm
A	but do you know what? actually I'm more than a marketer like
B	yeah
A	it's the stuff that I've
A	yeah
B	we were designed to be into like develop our skillset and make er have a really broad skillset
B	yeah agreed
A	there you go so you know the interview was a rough one
B	was it? what did you have to do?
B	er
A	I had to do I had to write a paper
B	do you want a drink by the way?
A	what have you got?
B	erm I've got some cans in the back I've got like Coke but I think it's a bit flat I've got tea coffee
A	I can deal with flat Coke flat Coke
B	flat Coke?
A	yeah erm I had to do a proposal
B	yeah
A	one how I would support customers effectively throughout the lifecycle of the qualifications
B	mm
A	it was it was GCSE and A level geography
B	okay
A	so it's stuff that I kind of knew
B	yeah
A	so I came out with
B	mm
A	she checked it twice until it was you know she thought yep it's pretty good now
B	yep
A	which is a compliment from her so
B	yeah and it's always good I think when you're applying for a job within a company people always try and help you
A	mm
B	and they're really
A	like
B	yeah
A	I'd gone out at the weekend
B	mm
A	with
B	yeah
A	we'd got absolutely plastered cos it was a bottomless brunch
B	oh no
A	ended up falling over really badly
B	oh shit
A	getting concussion
B	shit oh my god
A	and like we didn't know this at the time
B	yeah
A	cos everybody just thought I was drunk and I was like no no this is more than just
B	yeah yeah
A	you know a prosecco or whatever that I might have to go to my uncle and auntie's they thought I'd completely lost it
B	oh no
A	cos they they just thought I was drunk
B	yeah
A	erm and er ever since that I had a massive headache
B	shit
A	and I couldn't see properly
B	yeah
A	like I was seeing things a bit I thought oh you know the next day it's like ah I'm probably just hungover but okay
B	mm yeah
A	and
B	go to the hospital
A	we can go to hospital if you want and I was like oh no it should be fine cos you know I'm a bit of a drama queen when it comes to overanalysing things so it might just
A	it's just a headache you know it's just a hangover
B	yeah yeah
A	because you know everybody says they get worse as you get older kind of thing
A	erm you know so I'm just like maybe that's what it is
B	mm
A	and erm but it kept getting worse and worse and paracetamol wasn't taking it away at all
B	mm
A	and I'd been taking it for a couple of
B	really? not in
A	in
B	that's shit
A	or in
B	yeah
A	so I went to the
B	mm
A	erm but it was like I kept seeing like
B	yeah you can yeah
A	like wavy lines and dots and stuff but it was like everything's kind of fuzzy and my eye movements just felt a lot slower
B	oh
A	so it was just a bit like I'm not entirely comfortable with this
B	and even when you like you were like that even moving your eyes hurt yeah
A	it hurt like honestly like I got it to like here and it would just hurt
B	mm
A	cos then what I'd done is I'd hit my neck
A	and then I'd they said that even though it was like a small bruise they could tell from where it was on my neck that I'd fallen really badly
B	yeah
A	erm which I had done I'd fallen down like steps I'd fallen to the side of
A	it was just gross
B	oh
A	erm luckily
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it
B	yeah but lots of rugby players get concussion from like playing
A	like
B	but they carry on and
A	exactly and I think that's what that's kind of what it was but none of us could remember if I'd hit my head or not erm
B	mm
A	or at least part of my face or something so by the time that it got they said right if paracetamol and ibuprofen together don't work go to the doctor so I did and they're like yeah it's concussion you know it's it's you know it's still early days but if it's still there like
B	mm
A	you know I just I just kept getting the
B	no not at all
A	but until that point nobody knew that it was concussion or anything so I'd just been completely dazed for like half the time
B	mm
B	yeah
A	a lot of the things that concussion related are also chronic fatigue syndrome related
B	oh okay
A	like the sensitivity to lights the not being able to form words and I was like but this is different
B	yeah
A	but I can't like tell erm so when it got round to applying for the
B	mm
A	I was like
B	you weren't really with it yeah
A	I'm concussed I can't erm so I didn't end up applying for them anyway
B	that's a shame
A	but they ended up being stopped anyway cos of the recruitment freeze so
B	ah there's still there's still a recruitment freeze?
A	no they just started it again
B	ah
A	erm
B	oh sorry
A	no that's fine erm
B	yeah what? like?
A	erm so then this
A	yeah and then this job came up in geography which is maternity cover
B	I'll leave that the chicken in for a little bit longer
A	yeah and they'd basically reopened the job cos I don't think they got enough candidates or they didn't like the look of the candidates that they had
B	oh that's cool
A	so I talked to the highway manager who is kind of I've got my product manager and then I've got her manager
B	yeah
A	so they obviously see the work that I've done and things like that and they they know who I am they've worked with me
B	yeah
A	I've talked to them quite often we've been to like negotiations and stuff like that together so it's like oh okay so I kind of talked to her to say you know basically is this a bit of a joke me applying?
B	yeah
A	and she went
B	you don't wanna apply for a job if you're if you genuinely think you can't get it
A	yeah exactly erm so you know she was like they're
B	mm
A	this was on the Friday the deadline for the job was on the Monday so
B	mm
A	like going through I was like I actually think you know I can
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	it was like oh god erm so then by the time that I got it in it was like midnight on Monday obviously
B	obvs
B	well you know at least at least you made the deadline
A	yeah but the only thing is was that
B	ah
A	I was like that's not
B	I hate it when that happens
A	that's like that is not helpful
B	yeah I hate it when that happens
A	erm and er but basically I got a call to interview within less than twenty-four hours
B	that's that's sexy
B	mm yeah
A	so
B	looking out for your
A	erm
A	of my brain
A	well
B	ah
B	no that's good though
A	they laughed but it's true nobody else is gonna have editorial marketing and service management experience unless they're me
B	I mean that's true I think you should like I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that I think you should be like yeah boom I'm awesome I have all these skills
A	yeah
B	hire me
A	so we'll just see what they say like to be honest the people were so
B	mm
A	but she was lovely I was like jeez is she really liking my interview or is she just that enthusiastic and everybody went yeah she's just that enthusiastic
B	ah
A	I was like that's good but it's
B	I know that puts you off when you're in an interview with someone who's a bit like comes across as like grumpy isn't it? cos you can never read them
A	mm mm so mm
B	mm
A	before that was
B	oh no
A	in order to survive
B	a job is far more important than a
A	yeah
B	is literally turn up at Gatwick and see what happens
A	oh yeah but it was just that kind of thing where I was like if this were normal I'd've been a bit more organised and actually figured out how to get to Gatwick
B	mm
A	or how it was gonna work or you know stuff like that I was just a bit like it's not that I'm not looking forward to the holiday
A	I've just got a lot to get through first which I'm sure you did too
B	mm
A	erm so yeah I was just a bit like oh say
B	well you sound very manic
A	well yeah but
B	it'll just be
A	there's no pressure it's
B	there's no pressure to do anything we can just wander round eat if we get cold we can go
A	we're in a business suite by the way
B	mm
A	when I was looking at it
B	I know
B	and because also like it's unlike it's not like Berlin where there's so much history and stuff to see like
A	mm
B	with this we don't have to rush around
A	it kind of looks like the same stuff they keep saying
B	mm
A	er one screen shot
B	palaces castles and some statues
B	mm
A	oh and some nice parks and the river
B	I know
A	kind of just making my life I'm just like
B	I'm kind of excited about

A	but when I put in that reservation number it only showed me the pick up time for the way back
B	well
B	I'll check my email it should be we should have one there
A	we do I checked the email cos I was gonna this was after I rung you and I
B	mm
A	just after I rang you and erm I was kind of just checking it's the kind of seat where okay we've only
B	yeah
A	it's only one piece of hand luggage it was just really basic stuff like that
B	oh that's okay
A	and I checked the reservation number it was like it was only showing the way back but in the email it does say we're gonna pick you up from this
B	yeah
A	when you go to
B	we'll be fine we're big and ugly enough to look after ourselves
A	beautiful enough
A	it's the kind of thing we do
B	yeah
A	apparently it's the cheapest stag do destination
B	I did
A	apparently that's where Eurotrip was filmed as well I'm like oh great
B	well we're cool enough well hey we're
A	mm
A	and it's got all the communist era stuff that we kind of like as well
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and even if it's a bit rubbish
A	it will not be rubbish
B	yeah even if
A	it won't be rubbish
B	yeah even if it is a bit like people
A	hey it's the only capital that borders three countries
B	mm
A	and we get a
B	I know tell me about it
A	and it's but this time we can go oh you wouldn't get this on EasyJet

A	mm
A	I just wanted my vodka and Coke at ten in the morning
B	with Naples we're flying
A	there was one of them that
B	I dunno I do love though that erm people are like oh yeah we're going to
B	all inclusive pretty much and they're like what?
A	mm
A	but how do you afford it on your salary?
B	mm
A	and I'm like not being funny but I have a brilliant friend who finds
B	yeah
A	and like
B	like
A	why not?
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	but I couldn't actually
A	mm
B	yeah no Secret Escapes is genuinely like one of my favourite favourite sites now
A	mm
B	that's the thing though it is like I trust Secret Escapes
A	yeah especially like with Berlin like
B	mm
A	the first time we did it we
B	it works so well
A	and
B	mm
A	and they were kind of advertising cheap Christmas market type deals he said they did have one but the cheapest one was Prague for about a hundred and thirty and I was like yeah we were oh a hundred and seventy I was like yeah but we went to Berlin for a hundred and thirty
A	obviously like I was like yeah yeah well
B	we went to
A	hello but erm
B	I do love a good Christmas market are you going anywhere before Christmas apart from with me?
A	we were thinking of going to
B	mm
A	but the problem is is that I'm not sure about
B	yeah
B	oh yeah of course like deposits I hate deposits
A	and then I'm just a bit I'm just a bit worried
B	mm
A	then it's
B	Christmas
A	and it's just that kind of thing I can't be saying to work that I'm knackered and exhausted
B	if you keep going away
A	if it's
B	yeah
B	mm
A	that I've just gotta be like do you know what?
B	time for a little chill
A	done now
B	and
A	exactly so
B	yeah
A	that's great but I just can't like
B	mm
A	I physically was just like I just physically cannot
B	yeah
A	do another like holiday because you know not one like
B	yeah
A	mm so yeah
B	oh for Christmas?
A	if that
B	mm
A	I dunno to be honest I'm hope I need to know where I'm living what I'm doing
B	mm
A	or where I'm gonna be by that point so yeah so basically I kind of said to
B	yeah
A	cos there was no turnaround basically erm because I was on holiday on the day that I'd applied for the job and I wasn't gonna
B	mm
A	I wasn't gonna say it
B	no
A	and erm
A	they don't
B	you don't have to tell them
A	no erm like if it went to second interview I'd tell them
B	mm
A	but and she was like er and she was like well you know why are you? you know and I was like well it's always in our
B	mm
A	and publishing but then I enjoyed marketing so much
B	yeah
A	I went into that and I'm now at the crossroads where I either really dedicate
B	and give it a go
B	mm
A	the opportunities they did have for people like
B	mm
A	and she was like yeah yeah but I don't want you to think that there aren't opportunities
A	take it on and it was like yeah okay but now it's like double the work
B	mm
A	erm and erm
B	you can say what I want to hear but
A	you've gotta do what's best for you and er and that's what that's what's gonna help you with your promotion next year and I was like yeah well we'll see but
B	empty promises isn't it?
A	mm but
B	yeah
A	not at the moment
B	that's good
B	ah cool
A	cos he wasn't liking them on the train
B	mm
A	he's not started yet but he's just gonna be a a product management associate and in the traditional sense of the word
B	yeah
B	cool
A	and erm she was like tell
B	mm
A	of training
B	wow
A	erm but yeah hopefully that might force her to leave work at a reasonable hour
B	mm
A	rather than doing two hours of overtime every day
B	why was she doing that?
A	just so much to do
B	god
A	yeah
B	I love my job
A	how about you? so your new job
B	my new job er
A	when does that happen? it hasn't started
B	start on the sixteenth
A	mm
B	yeah starts on the sixteenth of November it's all happened so quickly we've had a massive
A	mm
A	mm
B	erm
A	that's really good
B	I know really quick really good only for UK and
A	mm
B	which is international
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	which is fine but then
A	mm
B	he needed a project coordinator to work with him
A	mm
B	erm and so basically I kid you not two weeks ago we had a meeting and we were like all the credit coordinators will will er carry on as usual but they're
A	mm
B	and then we have the UK schools team
A	mm mm
B	they both kind of work independently of each other despite that we're all under the family of education
A	mm mm
B	erm they have their own editors project coordinators whatever you wanna call them and then we do our job we don't do any hands on editing but we organise the development editor the copy editor
A	mm
B	we organise all of that we do some hands on content when it comes to the review side but we don't have to do any physical like lots of hands on content and stuff
A	yeah
B	all fun now they're merging them they've created two departments they've created the project coordinator department and then the content department so the content department are basically gonna be the original UK team but they
A	right
B	so now what they're gonna do is they're gonna have a project coordinator work with a content specialist
A	mm mm
B	and the DE
A	mm
B	because we don't really have time to check proofs as much as we should and so they're gonna do more things like that but and they were all there was all spaces for us there were no redundancies made it was really good
B	but
A	mm
B	Australia South Africa India and he basically works together on e-distribution and content to make it global
A	mm
B	erm so what I he and he needed a project coordinator and he basically they what they said is one of us is gonna have to go and work for him anyway so this is the job who wants to apply for it? and they opened it up and everybody else was really scared to do it
A	mm
B	they were just like well we don't know what it is cos
A	changing yeah
B	but there's other
A	mm
B	erm and like no one really knows what they're gonna do and he's just like I want you to be really heavily involved in the content at the moment because we're still redoing this restructure I'm not entirely sure what your job's gonna be and everybody was kind of a bit put off by it they were a bit scared and that and he was like well we want you to do project management we want you to work with the programme manager we want you to like maybe go to South Africa we want you to work with e-distribution we want you to
A	and
B	yeah
B	and like they we want you to do scheduling and I was just like it just seemed like it aligned to what I was
A	mm
B	good at originally like cos I had my project management qualification and everything
A	mm
B	and after the meeting everyone's like oh I don't know if I should apply and then within five minutes I'd applied
B	and he saw my CV and apparently he was really excited by it he was like and I had a meeting with him he's like why why do you do what you do? I was like what do you mean? he's like well your skillset is so much more advanced than what you're doing so why are you why are you a project coordinator? I was like well because the job I kind of applied for wasn't the job I thought I was gonna be doing
B	and he was like so you fell into by accident? I was like yes
A	yep
B	he was like
B	and so pretty much no one else actually applied for it because they actually realised that I was gonna get it anyway
A	ah
B	erm like all the managers wanted me to do it all of the like
A	yeah yeah
B	she wanted me she was like I'd put you forward for it anyway like everybody wanted me to do it and so literally last week he was like yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	sounds very grand
B	it's quite exciting
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	which is something I've never done before I've just created the products I've never actually looked at where they go afterwards and how what I do as a project coordinator impacts upon what happens after
A	mm mm
B	and it's just like what the fuck?
B	mm
A	erm
B	so I officially start on the sixteenth but I've kind of been working with him
A	mm
B	this last week
B	like her last day was today but she was somebody who like talked non stop I had about five maybe not even five conversations with her I know her entire life
B	she's been engaged three times she is pregnant with her boyfriend she's four months pregnant with her boyfriend's baby they've been dating for five months
A	oh
B	they spend every single weekend together
A	oh god
B	and four nights or and two nights during the week
A	oh jeez
B	they're inseparable but she's not a
B	I was like yes okay
A	and they're having a kid?
B	mm
A	mm
B	and been engaged three times
A	mm
B	erm
B	just yabber yabber yabby and
A	so what's she doing? going to a new job? or just
B	she can't she can't go to a new job pregnant can she? they won't give her
A	that's what I mean
B	so she's moving to
A	mm
B	he lives in
A	yeah
B	erm she's moving to
B	and she said er and she said yeah well we looked at the finances and it seemed like it would be it would be I'd get just as much money without work as I would would working I was like that doesn't make any sense you've got you've they've bought a house they've now got a mortgage
A	wow
B	and I was like how does that work? how can you quit a job and go and buy a house?
B	I was so confused I was just like you know when you're just listening to someone and you're like I don't understand
A	how?
B	like you don't even make logical sense
B	but she's officially gone she left today
A	let's hope it works out for them
B	mm
B	because she sits on her own she's really like and no one really she doesn't work with anybody cos
A	mm
A	mm
B	and he was like well we could just make up some
B	we can't just randomly sign the card ten times so I had to go round my team and ask them to sign it they're like who's this for? I'm like
B	just sign the fucking card look there's a space er fill it
A	oh
B	but it was good cos the day I got in I got in at half seven
A	oh god
B	I know
A	I wasn't even in I was
B	you don't look like a tramp
B	and people have been talking about that all day I haven't seen it though
B	Monty the penguin oh was amazing
A	still quite sweet I spent the first bit being like I don't get it
B	mm
B	I think you're always like that with the John Lewis advert though
A	mm
B	like that advert with the little boy
A	mm
B	and the
B	when he gets a girlfriend
A	oh my god
B	but
A	I was like well you know
B	yeah I remember you saying
A	last last year I was like I don't really wanna do anything moon related
B	no
B	I haven't seen it I'm sure I'll get round to it at some point
A	mm
B	I like it
B	mm
A	it was
A	and I was like oh my gosh that'd be so cool if you actually did
B	you're ringing me? after all these years
A	yeah
B	I saw you yesterday
A	exactly you're getting my humour now
A	oh
B	but apparently there's
A	mm
B	hello is it me you're
A	mm
B	mm yeah
A	if you'd like to meet
B	like to meet he's like I every time I come and see you I ask you to go out for a drink and you always tell me to fuck off and
A	there's a there's a picture that's like
B	I quite like it as a song
A	I do
B	I think it's nice
B	he must be like seriously
A	after
B	yeah
A	fuck's sake she's still talking about this four years later
B	yeah seriously love you know like we're er we're over
A	cos I was thinking like if I was to see
B	mm
A	you know cool you know do you know what I mean? whereas
B	yeah
A	for other people it's different
B	mm
A	isn't it
A	isn't it? mm mm
B	I don't I don't wanna be with him though
A	no
B	I don't
B	it's fine perfectly fine
A	it's okay?
B	yeah
A	so there wasn't any kind of questioning of that?
B	no no not at all
A	both very clear?
B	I was like firstly I don't think you should like you've just come out of a relationship
A	mm oh how's that been going by the way?
B	and ah not very well I don't think I think she's got some issues well I would have some issues
A	well I would have some issues if I'd moved half way across the world and then he dumped me
B	yeah she's not a happy bunny but she doesn't like I don't think she knows that he's seeing me but erm
A	well that's definitely not gonna go down well
B	yeah I know like he's like I'm really sorry but do you mind if you don't put anything on my Facebook wall? I was like yeah that's fine
A	mm
B	and then we went to the party and like nothing happened
A	mm
B	he just met everybody and it was really it was really fun it was nice everybody like
A	mm
B	and he has been really making it like he's been trying
A	mm
B	like he's seeing a counsellor
A	mm
B	erm and cos he had depression he
A	mm
B	like he's really admitting all his faults and stuff and I was like
A	mm
B	that's fine that's great you know I don't hold it against you I've got no problems with you like there's no
A	mm mm
B	I just don't feel that way about him anymore
A	mm
B	I don't look I just don't
A	not right now
B	no and I
A	mm
B	last night I went to the fireworks with
A	having fun
B	yeah I like having someone there having like a boyfriend there would've ruined that moment
A	mm
B	because we were all there together and we were all single and we were just happy and chilling and having fun having a laugh
A	mm
B	but the moment you bring a boyfriend or a girlfriend into that situation the dynamic changes
A	mm
B	oh my god they were amazing
A	I saw I saw a really big fireworks display in
A	erm and that ah at least
B	I love fireworks so much but it
A	mm
B	really really good actually
A	mm
B	but no it was a nice evening
A	cos I was sad I didn't get to see any fireworks
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah I think bonfire night's one probably one of my favourite nights of the year
A	mm
B	and then went home and had hot chocolate and then I came back here
A	right nice
B	but oh my god oh
A	oh what's going on with
B	oh nothing
A	erm
B	nothing's going on there but erm
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	erm and we all get on really well as a four so like
A	mm
B	erm
A	yep yep
B	that her ex boyfriend is having a baby and getting married
B	and they broke up a year ago so it's like a year later
A	okay yeah yeah
B	he's having a baby and getting married erm and so last week she was on like a bit of a train wreck like I'm so alone
A	yeah
B	my life is over
A	yep
B	I'm gonna die with like cats erm
A	oh god
A	oh
B	like everywhere he went she followed him
A	oh god
B	she
B	and
A	not cool
B	and then she was like kiss me he's like no no I don't think I should he she was like please kiss me he was like
A	oh gosh
B	yeah exactly and then she was like oh no you can come home with me come home with me
A	oh fuck man
B	and he was like hell no
B	yeah exactly that's what we said I was like I was like I love you he's like really? I was like yes because
A	that's it yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah so it's not like you know
B	mm and she's like but you got with
A	yeah
B	erm and me and
A	yeah and it's just like oh
B	mm yeah exactly erm so
A	mm
B	erm and she was really like embarrassed about it
A	oh
B	and I was like well no offence it's your own fault
B	like I told you not to do this
A	mm
B	and you basically just turned round and told me to piss off and I'm like and then she was like yeah but I think I really like
A	no let's not do
B	you've known him for like a week you've had like five
A	mm
B	you got drunk at a party he was the new guy on the scene so you went after him like
A	yeah
B	yeah I was like you don't like him? she goes yes I do
A	ah
B	because you kissed him once when you were drunk and no offence but you asked him to go home with you and he said no and she was like oh yeah
A	oh here we go spiral
B	I was like it's not that he doesn't find you attractive he just doesn't want that like he got he's erm he's being he's going through through a divorce he's thirty-one years old like he's going through a divorce he doesn't want your he doesn't want to be in a relationship with anybody let alone you
A	no
B	I was like it's not cos he doesn't think you're pretty he doesn't think you're not because he doesn't think you're cool
A	just
B	just so don't go there and she was like oh
A	yeah
B	I was like I am tired of listening to you whine
A	mm
B	and like I told them that she got with somebody else just because it just came up and
B	no and she was like
A	ah
B	and it just went from bad to worse and then she like sent
A	mm
B	so much drama I was like I don't need this
A	ah
B	like
A	yeah just yeah not
B	so much drama from one party
B	like
A	is she feeling a bit better now?
B	she no not really she's gone back to
A	yeah
B	but she gets really bad FOMO you know like fear of missing out
A	yeah yeah FOMO yeah
B	and she gets it really badly so I was round
A	mm
B	I didn't see her Tuesday I didn't see her Wednesday but I was
A	mm
B	and she was like oh where are you? I was like at
B	the fireworks and she was like oh
A	mm yeah
B	it's kind of like once when we were in
A	yeah
B	we kind of got over that and she we'd just got to a point where all three of us were like fine again and she was comfortable with us
A	yeah
B	like there was a time when I wouldn't even tell her I was with
A	yeah
B	erm and now I think she's gone straight back to it like at the moment it's like I'm with
A	yeah
B	it's like she's like oh you're not with me like oh
A	oh yeah and it's just like
B	yeah
A	she is but like
B	yeah
A	you know build a life for yourself you were happy you came to
B	mm
A	you built a life for yourself it's it's what you do I'm not
A	you know I'm better than I was in terms of happiness
B	mm
A	you know in
B	yeah
A	much better than you know that
B	yeah
A	on the edge erm
B	yeah
A	but you know there are options I don't know which options are gonna stay open
B	mm
A	I don't know which options are gonna stay closed but you know it's like
B	yeah if you're not happy you've just gotta change something
A	you've just gotta do something for yourself
B	even if it's one thing you've just gotta change it
A	exactly
B	job house
B	mm
A	that's gonna change things completely it's a different
B	do you think?
A	yeah cos er he's not with his parents anymore
B	mm
A	so that's gonna change the dynamic
B	do you think they'll go out and be more like laddy and stuff?
A	I reckon so but that will be a good thing
B	okay
A	in the way that
B	mm
A	with a three hour round commute
B	mm
A	he's got no time for a life at the moment Monday to Friday
B	yeah
A	so it's like what have you been up to? well yeah work and
B	yeah
A	just the gym and then just chilling and it's like
B	mm
A	do you know what I mean? whereas and he's got a new job he's got a permanent job now
B	oh
A	with
B	that's good
A	so it's like all like it's kind of like it's not changing for me
B	mm
A	but it'll change how we are cos it's the kind of thing where it's like it's a house it's not
B	mm
A	you know it's not like you know his parents'
B	mm
A	things have to be quiet or you
B	yeah
A	like you know that kind of
B	no
A	more than me cos he's in a different industry and that's just the way that it goes but I was like I seriously need to get a job
B	what are you on at the moment? twenty?
A	like twenty-four
B	mm
A	I'm not even that but
B	that's so bad isn't it?
A	so
B	especially in
A	well that's what I mean cos I was like I'm not being funny but if I'm having to pay six hundred and fifty
B	that's half a salary isn't it?
A	a month that's pretty much yeah
B	yeah
A	when you when you take out like
B	that's poor
A	other
B	cos
A	she got about thirty and a half
B	yeah
A	when she went into product management so when they asked me about salary I said something in the region of that
B	mm
A	with scope to review it
B	yeah
A	it's kind of like
B	and I don't know if they'd give you that cos you're an internal and I don't think they'd bump up your salary
A	well they
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	was she on twenty-three?
A	no she was on a little bit more but not masses more
B	mm oh okay that's pretty good then
A	but I but I basically
B	mm
A	what? are you talking about yourself?
B	mm
A	I was like why did you sell yourself short? like you I was like I don't know what wage to go for
B	yeah
A	I can't say thirty-five cos that's er twelve grand
B	yeah
A	yes the job might you know do that but they kind of like I was kind of
B	mm thirty grand's good
A	of around that
B	I'd be happy with thirty grand
A	is you know where it should start
B	yeah
A	with scope to review it bearing in mind the tasks
B	mm
A	that I will be executing you know
B	yeah
A	so you know I think I think that was fine but it was I'm really glad that I got you know I know that you definitely have been saying you know change come on now change
B	mm
A	and then
B	yeah but you like you can you
A	but it was a good thing but it was more the kind of thing where
B	you had to kind of wait it out a little bit cos obviously you er you couldn't just change job after being ill
B	yeah
A	feel like there were ways to do that whereas
B	mm
A	actually it all ended up happening at once something may come of it something may not but
B	yeah you never know it's worth trying
A	er something is well I think the
B	yeah
A	so my role is changing
B	mm
A	that's you know that's already that's already done
B	yep new house
A	my house is definitely gonna change
B	and I think the privacy might
A	yeah
B	the privacy'd be nice especially like if
A	yeah
B	just that privacy
A	just having
B	yeah
A	something
B	but also
A	it's not like
B	cos there's someone always there just like wandering around outside and you're just like oh
A	exactly so
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	so it'll be quite interesting to see but it's not like I can't invite people round and be like
B	mm no
A	everybody round like you know
B	yeah
A	or if you came to stay it'd be like dude right flat sorted done
B	yeah
A	I mean they've kind of said the kitchen facilities aren't brilliant enough for you to make full meals so you can use the kitchen but
B	yeah
A	I was kind of like
A	I was kind of like do you know what?
B	decide yeah
A	decide cos it was just I'm I'm not kidding my brain was about to explode
B	yeah
A	I've been kind of not arguing with
B	did you have an argument or?
A	yeah but it was a kind of not one that we'd had before but because you know things have been getting better in terms of communication cos he's not brilliant
B	men aren't
A	at saying stuff
B	just they aren't
A	so you know he's getting better but he's like
B	no but the thing is men don't like it's not enough it's not enough
A	yeah
B	it's it's just men in general
A	it's just everyone in general and
B	yeah
A	I'm just saying that especially at moments when I'm tired and stressed
B	yeah
A	and I just need that a bit more cos it's like I'm like if you say I look nice or you know
B	mm
A	it
B	mm
A	erm and that had meant that you know by coming to his I was doing the double the commute in the morning and things like that
B	yeah
A	and er he he appreciated it but it was another thing I was like you know when I cook for you like you know when you're tired or you're preparing for your interview
B	yeah
A	you know that's that's I'm more of an actions person and I was like that's great but I need some
B	yeah
A	but but it was kind of like
B	and I was just like well no offence but you're you're
A	you didn't communicate
B	you didn't communicate with me like if you'd told
A	mm
B	like the reason I pulled back and I never really let him in was
A	and then you got
B	yeah but the reason like I kind of pulled back and never really liked him was because I didn't know that he liked me
A	mm
B	like he never he was like yeah but I did like you like I bought you some lip gloss I was like what the fuck?
B	like
A	a verbal affirmation it's
B	because like and I think er what's confusing for girls is that for most girls the act of sex itself
A	mm
B	is a representation of love
A	mm
B	but nowadays it's not
A	exactly
B	so if you need that verbal affirmation
B	you can't just have an action
A	yeah it's really weird cos it was like yeah well as friends we weren't ever
B	mm yeah yeah
A	as friends whereas when you're in a relationship it's like oh well how are we doing? because you know everybody's automatic assumption about the job has been ah but you'll move in with
A	no no no no no no no like cos I'm like you know what?
B	no offence that didn't pop into my head at all
A	no not yours but I mean like other people who don't know me
B	yeah
A	as well and have just said oh yeah I'm with
B	mm
B	mm
A	erm and they're like oh yeah great you don't have to be long distance anymore and it's like
B	mm
A	obviously I get to see him more and blah blah blah but no no
B	no
A	not right now
B	mm
A	I I'd rather get myself sorted
B	yeah
A	and
B	and just not obviously not that you're in a bad place at all but if
B	yeah
A	and if they don't then it's a good thing you know we caught it when we did
B	yeah
A	but you know it's the kind of thing where
B	mm
A	we are ridiculously slow you know that as much as anybody else
B	well yeah
A	but it's not
B	eight months did it take you to have sex?
A	nine
B	nine months?
A	no not to have sex to er actually have from from him
A	from him being like I like you to kind of actually being like you know I want to go out with you that that was a good nine months so that gives you a pretty good indication and
B	oh yeah I was with you for the whole thing
A	you were there you were there
B	that was a rollercoaster
A	hell yeah
B	yeah
A	where do you know what? with him having a new house a new job you know actually having more of a life
B	yeah
A	not because he didn't want one but because you weren't able to then that's gonna change the dynamic
B	yeah of course it will
A	and you know I'd rather get used to that dynamic changing than get used to my own dynamic changing
B	yeah
A	and er you know see how
A	but do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	I become a product manager and that's it it's work work work
B	I rule the world yeah
A	and it's work work work
B	mm
A	you know you just don't you just don't know what's gonna happen but
B	yeah you just don't know what'll happen but I think that's really you've got a logical way of thinking about it like I'm glad that you don't just dive in and be like
B	we're gonna live together we're gonna be together forever and like that and just no
B	mm
A	but someone has to be
B	really?
A	yeah all because of different circumstances
B	that makes me wanna cry yeah
A	like you know but I was and they're like oh so so when are you gonna move in? I'm like well that's another like year and a half two years at least like
B	oh yeah I don't I
A	I'm just like I don't wanna rush into it like
B	well it's like I like my space my space is nice
A	he
B	yeah
A	he's an introvert I'm an extrovert we're opposites like
B	mm
A	that's true that is true
B	yeah
A	I've definitely become a little bit more introverted
B	that's good
A	because I've had to be
B	mm
A	I have to go home and rest
B	yeah
A	and
B	but also I think if you're going out with somebody who's an introvert you can't completely bombard them all the time
A	mm
B	because they'll just become even more introverted
A	yeah I know but
B	the more you try and push them the more they'll just retreat
B	good
A	and that the world isn't closed off to me and to be honest the fact that everybody's been like you're great at what you do and
B	mm
B	mm
A	the people higher up in the
B	yeah
A	like it was like on Wednesday I met up with some of the another person in the science team who'd also kind of given me a few quick pointers
B	mm
A	erm cos they'd had a
B	yeah
A	and she was like yeah but we want you back like
B	yeah
A	we want you back and
B	we still want you yeah
A	we
A	yeah
B	it's not
A	it's not in Oxford it's London
B	oh that's good
A	definitely London
B	cos I think I think
A	cos it's
B	I think
A	no I couldn't do another job if it's in
B	yeah
A	like I said like I've pretty much said to myself obviously it depends what jobs come up
B	mm
A	but if there if there is a flurry of jobs that happens and they're in London I'm like
B	yeah
A	but everybody was like oh would but would you move to
B	no
A	it doesn't
B	no commuting it doesn't work
A	er not
B	you don't wanna spend two or three hours of your day living on a train
A	but also
B	mm
A	this week and it's just not
B	yeah
A	effective because you haven't got loads of conversations with people
B	yeah
A	there's nobody in there in
B	no
A	you know in
B	yeah
A	I I'm not gonna move to
B	mm
A	and a lot lot older
B	yeah
A	then yeah maybe I'd stick in London because I have to and
B	yeah
A	you know I'd just deal with the gripes you know but I don't have to
B	no
A	so
B	there's no point doing something like that if you yeah if it's not necessary
A	not necessary like
B	mm
A	and feel secure
B	yeah
A	outside of work
B	cos the thing with working in London is that you have to make friends and it's a very big place
A	it's a hard place to make friends
B	that's the thing like it's so big and everyone's like oh you'll meet loads of people but because it's so big I actually think a lot of people get lonely because they don't know how to make friends
A	it's so and that's one of the things I just
B	yeah
A	but erm yeah but we shall see
B	yeah you'll be fine
A	everything is changing for everyone
B	mm
B	oh
A	you've got a new job
B	where's
A	she's still in the army
B	mm
A	but she's not gonna be a musician anymore she's gonna work in the recruiting side of things
B	ah
A	which she's quite glad about cos she needed a change
A	well she's been passed over for promotion a lot of times and
B	yeah I remember
A	it's gotten to the point well she's been she's going to be passed over again
B	shit
A	so it means that people who started three years after her
B	are above her
A	are above her
B	it's a joke isn't it?
A	and it's it it's an absolute joke because it's just a personal vendetta that the people in authority have got against her
B	mm
A	not that she did anything wrong with them
B	yeah
A	I don't know but you know and it was just that kind of thing
B	political isn't it?
A	do you know what? you know and she's going to a normal Monday to Friday nine to five which'll be really different
A	erm so
B	er
A	well they have to they have to do it
B	yeah
A	er yeah it's pretty
B	nice I'm sure he loved it
A	he did
B	oh did he?
A	yeah
B	nice
A	had a right chat with them very good
B	if I was a royalist I'd care
B	no I know what you mean
A	no but er
A	if he said something to you you'd be even happier
B	I would cry I'd be
B	even if yeah even
B	it's so good cos at the moment my team is now pretty much only me
A	mm
B	so he's like the head of the department
A	mm
B	but he's like the dad of the like the
A	yeah
B	grandad of the department
A	yeah
B	like
A	oh is he? yeah yeah yeah
B	she'll be like I wanna do this and he'll be like oh okay but he's the most politically incorrect person I know
B	and he just he knows that I love that sense of humour so he'll come over to me and tell me something completely inappropriate and then the woman
B	and her face just drops every time
A	ah
B	it'll be something really offensive and then she'll just be like mm it's like
B	oh christ's sake
B	like today he
B	and then I was like oh my god I actually said that out loud
B	oh god oh no
B	and he burst out laughing and
B	she was like oh
A	tumbleweed
B	I was like erm some people got it
B	sense of humour where the lower class citizens should be swept
A	corporate risks
A	inappropriate sense of humour
A	also
B	that's me
A	what's with the I want to do inappropriate things to you? hello there are much better ways of saying that kind of thing but
B	I know I know I know I was just like
A	ah sorry
B	it was just like well maybe no offence but if you'd actually spoken to me you would've got the chance I was like
A	so will there be a round two and three of the after party?
B	what?
A	mm I'm trying not to be like you're just like oh
B	she's upstairs she won't know she doesn't hear
A	oh oh oh oh oh
B	no that's not a grey area
B	you were in a grey area cos you liked him
A	yeah true
B	I'm not in that grey area
A	but is he in that grey area?
B	I don't know I don't think so
A	er
B	I've told him I don't want anything
A	yeah but that doesn't mean anything
B	but there's no pressure and I don't think
A	mm
B	that's what we both like there's no pressure
A	yeah and that's what
B	I think there was so much pressure on your on you two to be together
A	er it's it's the kind of thing where both of us turned round today
B	mm
A	and I was just like oh okay but I was having a terrible time like basically being shouted at
B	by him?
A	by no no no
B	oh
A	not by him by work people
A	in the middle of training like over email and all this kind of
B	shit
A	like being like it's the marketing execs fault and this was being sent to like the biggest people in the business
B	and they're blaming you?
A	yeah and it's not my fault
A	and it's nothing to do with me well it is something to do with me but it's not my fault
B	that's appalling
A	so basically luckily my manager stepped in
B	yeah so your line manager I was thinking that in my head literally that moment
B	fuck off
A	to be fair it's took everybody by surprise and there are reasons for this this this this this
B	yeah
A	and then
B	and also via email is just so unfair
A	well I was at a training course but it was just that kind of oh god it was that kind of thing where like
B	bad day
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	from time to time but there's just been a lot of kind of
B	but do you wanna know what the massive difference is?
A	what?
B	you've got something to lose
A	that's the thing
B	that's the pressure like at the moment
A	that's the thing and the pressure comes from that and that's the reason for the verbal affirmation because otherwise I'm like
B	yeah
A	are we at risk of losing things?
B	yeah
A	and I think that
B	that's the big thing for me like that's the thing that
A	and that's exactly what it is and I was just like
B	and er the moment you put a label on it
B	it's
A	mm
B	I know that I'm fine without
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	the moment you say well actually I wanna be with you again let's be together
A	mm
B	is the moment the pressure happens because there's that pressure to keep it going
A	mm
B	and it
A	mm
B	and therefore there's the risk
A	mm
B	yeah
A	okay
B	yep
A	cool
B	woo
A	fill me with carbs and I take you on nice places on holiday and research some of it
B	and have a kitten
A	I'm not having a fucking kitten
B	oh
A	I'm having a puppy
B	you have a puppy I'll have a kitten
A	we're gonna have to teach them to get on though
B	yep
A	that's okay then
B	yeah
A	yeah it's just it's just one of those things where I
B	yeah you will have an argument every now and again
A	it takes work it takes time but in the end if all goes well then
A	but you know cos I was like well why did we do the
B	mm
B	mm
A	what would you have done if I'd've asked you out? he went
A	mm
B	not to sound horrible but I think he would've said no
A	mm
B	and er I don't think you would be where you are now
A	exactly I think his answer would've been I don't know at which point I would've been like I'm rejected I'm horrible I'm spiralling
B	yeah
A	so
B	and like
A	I don't know it happened the way it happened you can't change it and I
B	yeah
A	I
B	mm
A	like but like
B	I fully admit that I'm one of these girls that I do not boys don't instantly look at me and
A	yeah yeah that's like oh yeah
A	mm
B	and I think
A	you take a while to grow on people
B	I do I do take a while but once I've grown I'm stuck there like mould
B	but erm
A	you just likened yourself to mould
B	yep
A	okay
B	I did
A	I'm just gonna just gonna go with that one
B	yep
A	mm
A	mm how was it?
B	oh really good she really
B	and she was like you're the sexiest and the grimmest person I know I'm like
B	yes
A	and that's why you love me
B	mm
B	but er no she really enjoyed it but it wasn't the same she didn't wanna be there
A	okay
B	she doesn't like Australia she just wanted to come back here and like her
A	mm
B	sister in law is
A	mm
B	even though it's the second child he's still just like I don't really want children they tie you down
B	so
A	well well a bit late now
B	mm and basically
A	it's not her fault
B	yeah and being like oh
A	fuck off
B	yeah and she said and like you really should come home you know you've only got a few months left in England I don't understand why you don't bother coming home now like why are you gonna wait until June? why prolong it? just come back now and she's like woah and she's like and also when you go and come back like don't move to
A	mm
B	but no I was like what a bitch
A	total projection
B	mm yeah that's what I said to
A	mm so when are you going?
B	when are we going?
A	June
B	all goes well June
A	so what are you thinking? are you thinking you're gonna see how this job goes?
B	yeah
A	and maybe do it for three months? or?
B	yeah exactly I'm gonna see how this job goes and if I enjoy it and stuff like er my plan is still I'd like to go I don't really think I don't see why the job would stop me
A	no
B	unless it goes really well erm but also this might be the opportunity that I can move to Australia branch so it's like you know if I make connections there is that
B	erm
A	mm
B	erm
B	I still would like to do psychology it's just so confusing there's just so much I wanna do and not enough money to do it
A	well why don't you give yourself the time until it comes to crunch point where you have to make a decision?
B	well that's what I was thinking
A	when when is the crunch point? in terms of when are you in your head thinking?
B	well
A	I need to book tickets by this point or is that
B	I don't really have one
A	that's not really a factor
B	just I can just book them whenever erm
A	oh okay
B	cos she's got to basically she's got to be out of England but she doesn't have to be out of Europe like she can go anywhere essentially
A	oh how long is that for?
B	but she's got ninety days
A	ninety? okay
B	ninety days per country but she obviously she's not gonna spend ninety days per country
B	that's how many
B	so I think she's gonna try and make the most of that and go to just like round Europe I've already done quite a lot of Europe
A	mm yeah
B	so I don't really need to so I will see yeah when she is ready to go back to Oz
A	cos it's not it's not like you have to follow her straightaway
B	no no that's no
A	you
B	exactly and
A	even if it's like July or
B	yeah like that doesn't bother me
B	I'd still like to go I think
A	mm
B	erm I think it would I've been really wanting to do something like that for ages and it just seems like a good time and I think this job'd be good in terms of opening up
A	closed doors
B	closed doors and meeting loads of people and
A	impressing them
B	exactly so
A	you could always say I'm going to Australia for two weeks do you want me to add on a week in Australia to work?
B	mm mm yeah
A	cos if they like you enough they'll probably say yes
B	exactly if I make an impression then boom
B	and he's the director of global like I'm not I'm not saying
A	yeah
B	I'd replace him but
A	no
B	the amount of people I can meet and
A	but you'd have to yeah and it's the kind of thing where they could create a role for you that expands on what you do or
B	I could if I wanted to go higher up if I wanted to go higher up in terms of the board and stuff it's a good place to meet people and to do things and to get exposure so
A	oh I know somebody who's left
B	you're kidding? where did she go?
A	she is doing her foundation degree in animal management
B	ah bless her that's good for her
A	somewhere kind of
B	mm
A	kind of
B	oh when did she leave?
A	end of October so she's only just left
B	mm
A	she left last Friday
B	was people
A	erm well she'd been doing her kind of studies already
B	mm
A	and then I think she
B	yeah
A	and she was just like this is just too much
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	erm for her to do that and get the experience
B	mm
A	and you know and erm so she decided to
B	quit
A	quit and I think it was a shock to her
B	yeah
A	and to everyone else but everybody was kind of like well it's still the right thing to do
B	the right thing to do
A	and she was like oh no oh no
B	you'll be fine
B	ah
A	good
B	good for
B	true only you
A	yep
B	yeah I remember that though
B	yeah
A	she is I think she hasn't been well but I haven't really seen her much recently
B	has she not?
A	but I think she's in her own groove and
B	mm
A	things are going good
B	that's good
A	so yeah but the house where she's in they're trying to sell it
B	oh no
A	while they're still tenants they're
B	yeah
A	so it lasts erm them until like August but they're trying to sell the house during that so they've got people coming round
B	oh
B	mm
A	that's causing a bit of stress but yeah and I think no I think she's good she's good
B	she's good
A	erm
B	yeah
A	either in work or out of the office I'm just like
B	yeah
A	no clue
A	don't know anything anymore
B	manic
A	so er yeah right shall we clear this up and then we can get to
B	it is late it's half twenty to eleven
