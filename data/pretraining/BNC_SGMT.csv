A	hey right oh I
C	mm
A	a A3 sign erm and yesterday I'd looked under that loads of times when I was looking for my two sticks I've lost
C	yeah yeah
A	cos I thought well I would put them there if I took em out of a pocket I would've put them on there in the bedroom
C	that's right yeah
A	you see? and I kept looking because all that was there was this thing I kept looking guess what was underneath there?
C	your two sticks
A	not the two sticks no but but my other backup disk
C	oh right
B	another one?
A	no the backup disk
A	I lost as well every time I lifted up
A	this piece of paper to see if my sticks were there I was looking at the
B	oh
A	the big external drive
A	but I never saw that because all I was focused on was a was a red thing
C	yeah
B	right
A	and and yeah
B	yeah
A	I never saw it
C	it's
B	mm
A	it it it it's strange you
C	you still haven't found your sticks though?
A	no
C	they're in the house somewhere
A	yeah I know but it's quite
B	you wouldn't have chucked them away
A	well but if er if if they'd been sort of in a bundle with something else or I'd
C	yeah
A	erm but but finding that that memory's good well that's cos yesterday I very nearly went out to Argos and I thought no I'm not shopping on Sunday very nearly went out there because they've got a similar one for thirty-five pound
C	oh right
A	five hundred gigabyte and that's what my other one is and I
C	no no
A	a while ago
B	mm
C	anyhow you found it
A	so
A	so that so that
C	how
A	that's a joyful moment
C	I mean it's it's er it's big enough to see ain't it?
A	well no it's only as big as my hand
C	yeah I know
B	yeah
A	it's shiny black
C	yeah
A	with the lead
B	but you just missed it
A	but I looked everywhere I I tore the place to bits
B	mm
A	I did and I and I still there's still one place I gotta it may have got kicked underneath where my cutter is
C	yeah
A	I can look under there
B	mm
C	lots of things yeah
A	yeah
C	that's very easy to lose something I mean
B	yeah
C	you walk walk around and someone come to the door you put put whatever it is down that you're you're then going to use
A	mm
C	you have a conversation you talk around and then you think wherever did I put that? and you look around for
A	mm
C	ages for it
A	yeah
B	mm
C	ages
A	waste loads of time
C	and and about three days later you you're doing something else and there it is oh you know
A	see I've got the vague recollection recollection that I probably have put it erm in my er just under the CD player in the car tucked it in there for a while
C	yeah
A	and then I found it one day and took it out and I put it just inside the front door on that little table and I can kind of remember it being there and thinking well actually that could drop off on the floor there and whatever was near it at the time I've just popped it in there so it might be in my in my toolbox
C	yeah
A	it might be somewhere in there but I've had a quick root in there erm then I've got another vague recollection of dropping it in you know I've got loads of those tubes that
C	yeah
A	you insert
C	yeah
A	for the signwriting? that er a tube was on the
B	yeah
A	other times the last time when you saw it
C	yeah it does yeah yeah
B	mm
C	yeah it's weird ain't it?
A	erm it is
C	yeah
A	but are you good at are you good at downloading stuff? you see I'm I'm a bit frightened I was talking to you about this the other day
B	yeah
A	what I need I've got the erm I've got on on
C	yeah
A	I've I've loaded on the Mind Your Own Business program
C	yeah
A	the accounting program I've got a backup I've got got I've backed up from the pink computer which is starting to go wrong
A	erm I've cos it's got a pink screen you know
B	mm
C	oh yeah
A	it's not reinstall it begins with an R whatever it is
C	yeah
A	I've done that and that's gone in and I it's now going but on the
C	oh I see yeah
A	cos I can't print from it
C	no
A	at the minute but I'm worried about I've got er I the only one going on the internet is the Windows seven
C	yeah
A	the new computer and when I go onto the Epson site and the
C	yeah
A	it says we have found your computer is Windows seven twenty-four no sixty-four bit or something like that
C	mm
A	I don't know how do I find out what
C	I think you're probably
A	will it be?
C	it's on the
A	mm
C	it's on the
A	will it come up on the properties for the
C	it should come up on the properties on
A	okay
C	when you press the
A	mm mm
C	er logo or whatever you call
A	mm
C	icon on the on the
A	mm
C	on the worktop or
A	mm
C	or whatever you call it the worktop
A	mm mm
C	you
A	mm
C	and it'll come up with the properties
B	mm
C	on there and that
A	okay so that but but then what what what what I'm frightened of is er you can
C	yeah
A	the this this thing
C	yeah
A	erm and you can select XP thirty-two or sixty-four bit
C	yeah
A	is the choice there
C	yeah
A	so his is probably a thirty-two isn't it then?
C	yeah it won't be sixty-four
A	yeah so erm and then if I select that and then put download will it download it and open it on my new computer and get all mixed up?
C	well it'll you have to have it downloaded to
A	when I select download will I get an option
C	yeah
A	of where to download it to?
C	yes of course yeah you'll get an option download it to your stick you see and then you take it out on a stick
C	and put it in your
A	but I'm worried that when I click this download thing it just gonna woof it into my computer and
C	well you just
A	and get all mixed up
C	you just cancel it you just cancel if that's going into your computer that ask you where you're going to go to
A	it will ask me where it's gotta go too will it?
C	yeah
A	it won't just woof it in and stick it where it thinks
C	no and and you put it in your stick or whatever
A	okay
C	in a CD or
A	alright see I've lost er I've lost all my confidence with these computers after what's happened
B	mm
A	er and and it and it
A	everything I do I have to think carefully before I do it
B	yeah
A	in case I'm doing the wrong thing yeah okay
C	you've always been like that though
B	yeah I get I get scared er
C	yeah
B	quite often
A	yeah
B	it says you will you will lose all your information if you do this and I think oh gosh
A	it's er
B	and it's okay really
C	it just says it'll
A	mm mm
C	all your er information you have not saved
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's it whatever you're working on that
B	mm
C	like supposing you're working on Word or or anything else and then you think oh I'll download something and that will wipe out unsaved information
B	mm
C	you have to save everything
B	but I do I do get scared and I come and ask you don't I?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	mm
C	I went on site to download something and Norton comes up
A	mm
C	get me out of here

A	yeah so is
B	yeah
C	they used to make them in nineteen twenty
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so I'm just got my eyes open is er is that a machine gun you got in the corner? no it's not it's a Hoover
B	mm
A	it looks like a machine gun from here
A	right it does I just saw the top of it it looks like the top of a submachine gun
C	it's a Dyson
B	submachine gun?
A	yeah if you look at that that bit it looks like the bit you
C	well er
A	grip on a submachine gun
A	it does
C	well I've never seen a submachine gun so
B	no we don't have one of those here
B	one of the things we don't have
A	you don't have one of those?
A	oh
C	no no
A	yeah
C	we've got a pop gun
A	so yeah
C	they're good have you ever made a pop gun?
A	erm no er we've had pop guns you know in the past
B	yeah we used to make them as kids
A	what we used to do and they were
C	oh right yeah
A	hawthorn berries
C	yeah
A	poke one in end they're lethal though when they go in your eye
C	I know
A	and so you open it push one in the end and and bang
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	we used to do that
A	yeah
C	but we used to make a pop gun we used to cut down a lump of elderberry
A	mm
C	about an inch inch inch and a half diameter
A	yes
C	right? and inside the elderberry you cut it out to about six inches
A	mm
C	right? cut it off nice straight bit
A	mm
C	and inside the elderberry is this what we call pith
A	yes yeah
C	right?
A	yeah it's a soft wood isn't it?
C	and we used to heat a hot a poker up
A	mm
C	in the fire
A	yeah
C	at home this is er I'm ten years old right?
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	doing this
A	and burn it through
C	and you used to push it all the way through and make a lovely lovely
B	we used to just push it through didn't we?
C	yeah but you had to
A	think you probably could cos it's soft
C	you you could push it through
B	yeah
C	you
A	it it makes a harder surface doesn't it?
C	put this poker through it and that made it
A	mm
C	really shiny and beautiful
B	oh I see mm
A	mm
C	right?
A	mm
C	then we used to cut a piece of hazel
A	mm
C	and whittle it down
A	yeah
C	until it fitted inside the
A	yeah
C	hole in the
A	mm
C	and er we whittled that down so it left a handle at one end and
A	yeah
C	and er whittled down that end right?
A	mm
C	and then you chewed the end of the hazel right?
A	ah so it swelled a bit?
C	chewed and chewed and chewed and chewed it and chewed it and chewed it and chewed it we had good teeth when we were kids
A	yeah
C	and you chewed it until it was all wet and horrible and then you just got on a bit of concrete you kept beating it
A	yeah
C	until you made a beautiful brush
A	yeah
C	it
A	mm
C	and that fitted in the
A	yeah
C	in the middle of the pop gun
A	yeah
C	then you'd go to get the acorns
A	mm
C	and bite them in half
A	mm
C	have you ever bitten an acorn?
A	no they're a bit bitter are they?
C	oh they we're awful
A	yeah
C	but we used to bite em in half knock them down the end of the pop gun
A	mm mm
C	and then you had to have a belt a good belt on
C	and you just went boom and god they used to go
A	yeah
C	they were brilliant
A	yeah
C	and that was our
A	do you know that
B	mm
A	wouldn't that be fun if if if er
A	wouldn't that be fun?
C	yeah
B	it would be yeah
A	and that would appeal to a lot of people
C	yeah
B	mm
C	I think
A	but it'd have to be make your own it couldn't be a bought one it'd have an inventive made up
C	yeah
A	for it to make the
C	do you know we used we used
B	yeah
C	scrape all the bark off the edge scrape all the bark off
A	mm mm
B	yeah
C	and polish it
A	mm
C	god no they used to look really really good and you know ten-year-old kids doing that and that's what we used to do
C	every year we used to make a pop gun
A	you could make it safe
A	you could make it safe cos it could erm if you had tubes set up pointed at at an area big tube
C	yeah
A	that you could only fire it if
A	your pop gun was in looking through the tube then it could only go in one direction couldn't it?
C	health and safety what a load of rubbish there wouldn't be any kids about today if it was health and safety
A	I know I know
C	I mean look what we used to do
A	we learnt didn't we? yeah
C	we used to saw the end off a tree which you were you were sitting on one side
A	mm
B	yeah
C	they crashed the
A	people used to
C	yeah
A	they'd do daft things like that
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	well that er
A	what's the daft thing? oh a daft thing was

A	no not no not so much violent but they don't know what they're doing they don't understand
C	mm
A	what they're doing they er the dementia's gone so far
C	yeah yeah
A	that they
B	yeah
A	it's not them
A	for the whole of their lives
C	no
A	it's just this is the way they have become
B	yeah
A	and because they've lost their mind's gone
C	yeah
A	erm
C	yeah
A	it seems
C	yeah
A	but it's er
B	yeah
A	I mean it's not fair that because she's good at it they put her in there and she always gets youngsters who don't know what they're doing and go away they go away and disappear and hide most of the time
B	mm
A	so she and it's just if she's doing the doing the medication sometimes she's got to stop and sort somebody out erm in you know while she's doing the medication because nobody else has done it you know change the bed or something like that
A	I know well the people the numbers are there but they they don't do anything
C	well they should do er who
A	erm
C	who's the boss of em?
A	mm?
C	there should be a boss
A	well there is er her boss tends to sit in the office apparently so I dunno it's not good
B	mm
A	but
C	mm
A	it's erm well she'll she'll just pack it in but she can't afford to that's the trouble
B	yeah it is a problem isn't it?
A	yeah
C	how long's she got before she retires?
A	seven years
A	so if she's sixty next oh now the can you help me with this? you
C	yeah?
B	yeah
A	and I'm think we I ought to have a surprise party cos so many people know her
B	mm
A	and a surprise party at
C	do you?
A	book book the hall and then find some reason to get her down there and er
B	does she mind people knowing how old she is?
A	don't think so no
B	mm okay
A	but but she doesn't like formal things she really doesn't like the formal things at all
B	no
B	mm
A	er but er I I've I think maybe
C	yeah
B	mm
A	but it'd be easy if it was just to bring a chair and we just do something like that
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah? cos she doesn't eat much anyway but it just nice to have a little gathering
C	yeah
A	wouldn't it?
B	mm
A	to celebrate it
C	that would yeah
A	but that's that's what I'm thinking
C	well that's only
B	that's January?
C	that's only about six quid to hire the hall
A	mm it's good
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	not very much
A	mm mm
C	and that's pretty good you know
A	yeah yeah
B	well it's six pound an hour actually isn't it?
A	an hour
C	is it an hour?
B	isn't it?
B	but I think for the residents around here
A	yeah yeah
B	er you'll be included now cos you're the church I should think
A	mm
B	I think it was twelve pound for the whole
A	was it? for the whole thing?
C	yeah
A	oh well that's good
B	for the evening
A	that's good
B	I think
A	yeah
B	but it wasn't very much
A	er see in the winter like that it'd be good cos you could have the fire going and that's
C	have a look on the website
A	that's
C	that'll tell you how much it is
B	yeah
C	mm
B	was it an hour?
A	mm
B	I know it's six pounds in my head
A	yeah
C	I've got six pound
A	so it'd be nice to do something special for her she doesn't want anything special but I think it'd be nice can't let that one go but then she's got another six years to work
C	six years that's ridiculous isn't it?
A	well er she would've been retired then
C	yeah
A	a few years back
B	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah er I I was
B	I was just er well I was one day out actually
A	were you?
B	erm I but I only had to wait another six months
A	did you?
B	I was lucky really
A	mm
C	yeah
A	now it's er gradually crept you see hasn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and she
B	mm
A	I can do this for another six years
C	well I shouldn't think she could
A	she well
C	it's a bit physical as well
A	oh it's terribly physical
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	turning people particularly if you can't find anybody else to help
B	that's right
A	some of them have gotta be turned every two hours
C	yeah
B	mm
A	but they can't turn themselves and
B	no it's too much for people to do
A	it is too much yeah
B	yeah
A	but er er she's it might come where she actually it might be a blessing in disguise what happens if you if if the doctor says that erm cos her shoulders both of them er ache she thinks she's got erm arthritis in her shoulders
A	so she can't do what she's doing does that erm will that benefit her?
C	well I don't know if it would because erm
A	no it probably wouldn't I don't know
C	I dunno
B	it depends what the doctors say
C	yeah
B	if they say
C	how long's she
B	if they told her
C	how long's she been doing it for?
A	what?
C	ever since
A	because she and she was caring for him
C	yeah
A	and because she'd cared so much for him she knew how to care for somebody in that position who is dying
C	oh she's not qualified then?
A	oh she's a fully qualified carer now yeah
C	oh right
A	oh yes she did she actually she she must've done a course done a did a college course
C	yeah
A	she's got er SCN she's quite not an SCN she she wears her badge quite proudly it's erm what other qualifications do you get at a college?
B	NVQs?
A	yes yeah she wears that and and she got the top one
C	yeah?
A	but she's also got what er what is more valuable er she's drugs qualified
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and that that's that's a very valuable qualification as well
B	yeah
A	erm so but she does kind of one of the places she mentioned she she really quite fancied but it means driving into
B	mm
A	and erm and she she's used she's she lost count of the number of people she's sat with while they died
C	I expect she has
A	and
A	and
C	yeah
A	and she's happier doing that than dealing with what she's doing with at the minute
C	yeah
A	so actually in er in a hospice probably
B	yeah
A	erm but it's a long er there's this one particular place she'd like to work but it's just too far to drive the money she would get and the and the travelling involved she
A	it'd cost her a lot to get there
C	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	erm but it's somewhere in
C	she'll have to get a bike
A	mm?
A	she's got a bike
B	really?
A	she's
C	what does she's wanting to lose weight for?
A	I know she's not she's not big
C	there's nothing on her
A	I know
C	what does she want to lose weight for?
A	she
C	oh
B	mm
C	do you say look at my bit here?
A	well mine I haven't got a bit here to grab I can't grab it
B	she just wants to do the hoop
A	I'm
A	she said not on the outside
C	is that what they said?
A	that's yes it's the fat
C	that's the fat on the inside? your gut is fat on the inside?
A	er yeah it's apparently er yeah
C	so it must be fat round your liver and your heart as well?
C	no
A	only a little bit it's like less than an inch look
C	pinch an inch
A	erm look look it is it's less than an inch
C	well at your age I should think you should be proud of that
A	that's not bad not bad thank you
C	no
A	and the shirts cos if I lose a bit I well no I'm never gonna lose lose it in my chest am I? cos that's
B	well
A	are you? so you were
C	no
B	well you were
C	no no no

C	no I haven't worn em since but I took em out
A	I had some pins holding them up?
C	yeah
B	oh were those the ones that I took the bottom off?
C	yeah cos the bottom was ripped
B	oh right
C	you know that have
A	had I turned em up and put stapled them then?
C	yeah you'd turned em up and stapled em and pinned em
A	and I hadn't gotten round to sewing them?
C	no
A	oh so I got them ready
C	yeah
A	and I hadn't sewn em
B	do you remember doing it?
A	no
B	oh
C	er
B	are you sure that no one else did it earlier?
C	well he would know
B	you know er before they went to charity shop
A	no I
C	yeah you would've done yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I noticed it as soon as I put em on what's that? oh
A	no it
B	right
A	was it with a staple gun?
B	yeah
A	no I wouldn't have done that I might've put pins in and have em ready
C	no you had staples and pins and a little tiny safety pin
A	oh I er don't know
B	little gold one
C	a little brown safety pin
B	brass you know
C	yeah
A	oh I might've done that
C	yeah
B	tiny one
A	I've found some there's some stuff I've just bought on the internet it was one pound twenty-five free delivery so it'd cost em that to deliver it and it's a little tube and it's for sticking cloth and you you put it it er it it's supposed to be you
B	it's a what?
A	for sticking cloth and it's for sewing it's er it's it's called glue
B	oh
A	and you just you put it where you would've sewn it erm and then push it down and put something on it for fifteen minutes and it's done
C	oh
B	explain that again
A	it's a glue
B	it's a glue?
A	it's a glue
B	yeah
A	and where you would sew something like a seam down the bottom
B	right
A	I haven't used it yet
B	okay
A	erm you just put it where you would sew it
B	yeah
A	then you push push down oh no smooth it with something first then push down the two edges where you want them to join
B	okay
A	hold er put a weight of something on it er for fifteen minutes
B	so just just
A	it's probably PVA glue
B	just fabric glue? yeah
A	yeah
B	PVA
A	it's er
B	mm
A	erm and then you can iron it and it's fine and wash it and it's
B	right
A	it doesn't come out
B	yeah
B	yeah

C	yeah
B	yeah
C	well what do you want it for?
A	well I find sometimes they they go don't they? the sewing I've got a lovely pair of black trousers now

B	don't don't feel you have to
B	I've left some of mine
A	that'd be good
C	he's a nice bloke anyway
C	yeah he's a good bloke
B	have you come across my stitch ripper?
A	pardon?
B	talking about sewing have you come across er
A	have I got the stitch
B	yes
A	have you got it?
B	you did have it so if you come across it it's a little white one just give it back again cos I I I have got another one but I particularly like that one
A	I've got a pink oh no it's not I thought I'd seen a pink one recently but it's not that's it's
B	it's white
A	er one individual
B	you know what I mean don't you?
A	yes yes yeah
A	oh okay
C	yes you borrowed it about four years ago
A	what? to take a badge off something was it or something? I don't know
C	mm
A	did I?
B	it's er when you hurt your foot you had it
C	that's how long ago that was
A	mm
C	when you hurt your foot
B	had to do something
A	that's a funny thing about the two of us
B	well why don't you tie tie them
A	her right leg's her right leg's good and my left leg's good
C	that's brilliant
A	but I've snapped mine
A	I've snapped my my my right
A	and her her left one has got a pin through to make her she
B	oh
A	because she broke her ankle
C	yeah
B	so you'd be good at the three-legged race
C	you'd be good at the three-
A	no we'd be two-legged race cos we've only got two between us that's any good
C	yeah but you tie the two legs together
A	two bad ones together? and and when then we just walk on the
C	then you just walk on the on the good ones
A	did you did you see that erm?
B	oh yeah
A	and one body between them
B	yeah
C	oh that's right and they
A	so they had two brains
C	had to be separated
A	but everything else no they no they couldn't be separated
C	no
A	two heads and they went through uni and everything
C	oh that's right they did yeah
A	and and one
C	yeah
A	and the one on the left
B	oh
A	arm and the left leg but but they
C	yeah
A	when they'd finished talking
A	they'd just sort of go like that with their hands and then they'd
C	mm
B	yeah
A	erm and when they walked you try I couldn't get my head round thinking of this that one brain's working the right leg and the other but they could walk they could run and they could
B	yeah
A	ride a bicycle so you've got two arms
A	two separate heads working the two arms
C	yeah
A	you know one arm each
B	yeah
A	and they could ride a bicycle that was the most difficult thing they ever did but they
B	so if one wanted to turn left and other one wanted to turn right
A	no but they but they had
B	they had yeah
A	because they'd been together for so long they
C	they could communicate
A	they knew
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	they knew and erm
C	yeah
B	mm
A	erm and they both liked different things you see so they took it in turns for that and they took it in turns to decide what they would eat cos they liked different because they had the same tummy all the same guts the same tummy
B	yeah
A	erm but
B	mm
A	one brain thought I like that and the other brain's thinking I like that so they took it in turns to pick what they would eat
C	so they had to go to the loo?
B	mm
A	and it was wonderful yeah yeah
C	they had to go to the loo together?
A	yeah well they're they were just one person from here down
B	one person with two heads
A	but they had two heads
B	that's strange though ain't it? with two different brains you know
B	mm
A	and the whole left-hand side belonged to the left-hand head
C	mm
A	for the for the for the for the
A	limbs so all when they're
A	when you need two hands you've got to coordinate all er
B	yeah
C	yeah they have they've gotta
A	yeah
C	coordinate together yeah
A	quite extraordinary and they went they went through normal school erm and through
B	yeah
A	through university it was in America through
B	mm
A	and I don't know what they ended up doing I think they
B	but did they just do the one paper? one subject? er they must've done mustn't they? they can't have done different things can they?
A	but but there were two brains you see
C	yeah
A	they erm erm I don't know what they did but they
B	yeah
A	perhaps they studied the same thing cos they'd have to go to the same class wouldn't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	erm but it er it's just I it took me a long while before I could come to terms with how complex
B	mm
A	everything had to be well they were more than twins weren't they?
C	they were
A	well but twins can think together
C	yeah yeah
A	but but to be able to do this
B	yeah
A	it would how did we get onto talking about this?
A	oh legs
B	mm
A	mm
C	yeah
A	and did I tell you what happened on the walk with when I thought thought I was losing
B	er you told me
B	mm
A	it was amazing
C	didn't tell me
A	that was amazing
B	mm
A	that er that I
C	yeah
A	and and
C	did she?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	and and she said
C	oh
A	you see so
B	mm
A	and and she knows then
C	yeah
A	and so so we decided we'd come back but because it was still hadn't started raining not a lot anyway we went across the field from an angle we we were naughty we
C	yeah you can yeah
A	and we went across at an angle well
C	hedgerows

A	mm
C	lovely bloke and I I don't think he should've
B	did we tell you about that? cos erm he did mention er they were cutting down carbohydrates
C	that's right yeah
A	well yes she
B	they didn't say
A	she told me about the
B	yeah
A	er the the the thing about carbohydrates you can have them but don't overdo it cos if you overdo it then if you have an excess it they turn to sugar
C	is that what it is?
A	yes if so if
B	right
A	a portion of something erm if you have that little bit extra erm the
C	well I could live off new potatoes alone mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but if you do that that's a carbohydrate
C	yeah
A	if you have more than your portion erm then erm it it turns to sugar
B	oh right
C	I didn't know that
A	yeah
C	and er this is why
A	so that that is a problem still
B	yeah
C	this is why
A	pasta the same
C	pasta is the same
A	more if you have just just that few little bit too much that bit will turn to sugar
C	yeah
B	I see
A	so you've got to cut down on er watch the portion size
B	mm
A	and it's what can sit in your she was ever so good you know she's very patient with me
A	she said she would get
A	is it
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	she said er
A	yeah
C	and what do you eat? I said well I I like my cake
A	mm mm

A	mm
C	lemon drizzle cake and
A	mm
C	gooey
A	toffee cake?

A	yes she's
C	I said well I can't give up my cake I'm sorry
B	we er got some cake brought round today
C	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah but she's quite
C	well that's only
A	well I know
C	okay
A	but if you stop it now you won't get
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	you'll be okay
A	well I know it's
C	no
A	but what it will do it will delay when you get it so you'll get it later
B	so you will get it eventually?
A	you probably will get it eventually
A	but it will delay it
C	well she didn't tell me that
A	because it's she explained it it's to do with your pancreas
C	yeah
A	erm not working so well
C	yeah
A	but a lot of to do with pancreas is not working too well is is if you're too fat that's it's cos that's why large people tend to get diabetes because that's what prevents your pancreas it is down there somewhere isn't it?
C	yeah it's er
A	erm yeah and erm so that she explained that to me as well it it it's it's alright it's working alright but there's just not working as well as it should do
C	no
A	but you can make it work better by doing what I'm telling you
B	mm
C	and exercise
A	so yes and exercise yes
C	walking
A	she was happy with me walking the dog when I went right around the village yesterday
C	yeah
A	right
B	mm
A	we went we didn't come out this far but we did a big circle right
C	yeah
A	the way round the whole the whole erm
C	walking is very good for you it's
A	mm
C	your your cholesterol or whatever they call it
B	mm
A	mm
C	and all that
B	yes
C	have you have you got high cholesterol?
A	mm?
C	have you got high cholesterol?
A	no
C	no?
A	no
C	well that's a wonder
A	my well because I don't do
B	that's why you have statins
A	I I do statins but also I keep clear of fat you see?
B	mm
A	cholesterol's to do with the fat in your blood
C	yeah
B	mm
A	erm so my well my cholesterol level erm cos the doctor had me last year because it she explained my cholesterol is absolutely fine for somebody my size and age but because I have had a heart problem erm the government has set a slightly
A	well it's four point something
C	oh right
A	erm erm but if I get you below and she gave me this
C	three is three is the low is is a is a really good
A	mm
A	yeah
A	well I'm she said I would be happy if if you haven't
C	yeah
A	but er then she
A	er erm so that's the government that's set the target and if you can get people down below that you get an extra funding so she was quite honest about it but er she said really I'm happy the the way you are but if I can do this then you're helping me and you're helping the practice
A	you see? so I
C	yeah
A	it's very difficult to take that one last thing at night
B	mm
C	was that when you're supposed to take it?
A	you've gotta take is just before you go to bed
B	when do you take yours?
C	first thing in the morning
A	be last thing at night statins
C	is it? oh
A	yeah there's
A	and and
A	when I've said to nurses
A	they say are you taking your tablets? I said well I I don't always remember the one last thing at night cos I just wanna get into bed then erm and I forget it where do you keep them? I said they're in the bathroom they're there she said are they by your toothbrush? yes they're by my toothbrush but they don't always get used because I
B	yeah
A	and so many of each and at the end the at the end of so much time of them pretending to take these tablets all of them had the same problem they all the one that you had to take last thing at night they had lots left
B	mm
A	erm but all the ones you took in the morning and during the day they were fine
B	cos you shouldn't have Smarties to to clean your teeth
A	so the
A	but it was always that colour
B	yeah
A	that colour that was left
B	mm
A	so she said I know that is the most difficult one to
B	mm
A	keep a routine going but I do I know it's there and I have them right beside my toothbrush
B	mm
C	I have mine beside my bed well
A	er read the packet it's last thing at night
B	you never read anything
C	well you
A	but it's age for ages I didn't realise that erm I can't after I've taken do you know after
C	yeah
A	erm you're you're not allowed to eat anything for
C	half hour
A	half an hour you knew that? yeah?
B	mm
A	cos er I only realised that a short while ago
A	you probably told me
C	yeah I have mine first thing in the morning and that's it
C	and I don't eat until we get up
B	and then then we don't have breakfast until
A	mm
B	cos then I make porridge don't I?

C	oh that'd be awful wouldn't it? yeah yeah
A	but she says I'm afraid you're gonna er boring is gonna be good for you
B	mm
C	maybe just a bit of dried toast
B	I don't think a little bit just cut down
B	a little bit
A	it it's quite specific no sugar
B	oh right
A	just natural sugars in things like fruit
C	well I

A	but but er
A	but all of these in moderation
C	yeah er yeah
A	mm
C	you there's fructose in every bit of fruit there is
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and
A	mm
C	if you eat an apple
A	mm

I thought oh gosh what have I done wrong here? cos erm erm I was warden no one else was there and that's the first time I had to go in there myself and I thought I've gotta get there early cos I've got to there's lots of things I've gotta get set up take covers off things light the candles open the open the the the cupboard get out all the microphones put them in place find the place in the Bible put the Bible there you know get it all er all everything organised things set up for when people arrive there's lots to do and I'd never done it before on my tod you know I've helped with
B	mm
A	other people doing it so I've seen what they had to do so I get there at at a quarter to eight so I'm an hour and a quarter early
B	mm
A	gotta be brave now cos I'd never I've never switched the alarm off before
B	mm
A	right get my big key you know and I open the door and
A	I open the door and
A	yeah and er and I was so relieved when I got the number right and it

A	so relieved but erm about quarter er three minutes before the
C	yeah
A	it's a Wharfedale it's made by
C	oh wow that is a good one

B	mm
A	so I had that in the car
B	mm
A	then we erm we started singing something else and I wasn't doing particularly well and I made a few mistakes I think and then there was this sort of slam as the book you know book went down and she she just ran out the church and I thought oh heck I hope I haven't upset her by singing behind and trying to spit out the words
B	mm
A	that she wasn't singing or anything cos she's a bit she likes to be heard you know she's lovely
B	oh right
