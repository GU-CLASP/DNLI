B	Tig long hair
A	he's a fucking
B	he's like scared of dogs and
A	he's a fucking creep yeah but he's actually got quite a fun character
B	I like Opie man
A	yeah Opie's cool
B	you need to watch it man it gets so much better
A	yeah
B	like have you seen one called Falling Skies?
A	oh my dad likes that
B	yeah yeah and in the first couple you watch you're like oh it's a bit
A	does it? it
B	yeah yeah there's like three seasons it's alright
A	my dad really liked it
B	you know they normally make something for a couple of seasons it's it's because people wanna see more of it
A	mm do you ever watch V?
B	V
A	that was low budget as well something where
B	yeah
A	like aliens came down but
B	V?
A	yeah it was called V I think it was called V I'm pretty sure it was called V but there are actually like lizards of something and like
B	oh
A	ran and got through
B	oh right
A	so when I thought of Falling Skies I'm just reminded of V it's like and I haven't like
B	no no Falling Skies is alright man
A	I haven't really given it a try
B	I mean you tried watching Battlestar Galactica so
A	did we watch that?
B	yeah I mean we watched fucking Angel man
A	I found my Angel box sets the other day
A	like today
B	I was just too easily influenced District 9 was on the other day
A	yeah
B	Angel was alright when you get into any storyline it can be good
A	yeah have you ever seen this film Sinister?
B	no
A	that's fucking dark
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	like what way?
A	it's the only I've seen recently at the cinema that like actually had me like
B	have you heard of that
A	no I haven't heard of that
B	it's fucking meant to be horrible it's like you know
A	oh yeah The Human
B	The Human Centipede
A	yeah I have The Human Centipede
B	and everyone's like that's disgusting well the
A	I haven't heard of it
B	no I remember some guy at the gym telling my
A	do you ever watch that animal programme that I told you to watch? I can't remember if I showed you it or yeah
B	may have had mate who do I put that on and
A	it's dark
B	yeah mate who did I put it on for?
A	It's dark
B	because
B	I I showed it to a few people they're like don't show them
B	I haven't even shown the clip where that cow gets turned upside down and it gets its
A	yeah
B	trachea pulled out and it's alive
A	pretty graphic
B	yeah mate all well yeah but it's you know and when they pick that dog up and throw it in the fucking dustbin
A	yeah
B	really there's not much you can show of it all them bits are worse enough but
A	yeah
B	the rest of it's even worse
A	it's an onslaught as well it doesn't stop
B	fucking bad man when they skin that fox and he's still alive
A	yeah
B	in its skin its eye looked at me and I was like
A	yeah
B	you got to the medical bit and he was telling about the monkeys and I was like I've seen enough
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna see anymore
A	did we not even finish it?
B	no we watched like three quarters of it and it was like that's enough mate
B	have you watched the whole thing yet?
A	it was pretty dark
B	yeah mate
A	it was hard I couldn't do it I don't know anyone that's managed to do it the first time I I couldn't do it the first time the first time we
B	no
A	I say that to people when they talk about some programme that's swept them off onto off beef or something or some something random like Supersize Me or some bullshit now they don't like McDonald's but I'm like fuck all that shit just watch this
B	mm
A	this one film and if you have any qualms about
B	no that's nothing that's got nothing to do with food though it's just
A	no it didn't put me off eating food at all
B	I think it's more of a
A	it just treatment of animals just
B	outlook on yeah just
A	yeah it's speciesism isn't it that's what the whole thing's about it's random that you
B	yeah I I know I think it's just
A	I mean we treat our own people terribly as well but we're not robbing
B	mm
A	I mean we've done terrible things to our own people so I guess we have so it doesn't really compare but this was just focussed on the er animal trade
A	because things have to and under this paradigm things just have to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and easier more easily produced to make more profit the next year I just think at the detriment of animals that's the main problem like I would quite happily pay more for my meat if it were just treated better
B	mm
A	er it bothers me that like organic food is specialty food you have to pay to not be poisoned
B	the guy who's in charge of the farms this
A	mm
B	a PowerPoint thing he was like we're not organic if you think you're like if everyone wants farmers to be organic a lot of people would die
A	wouldn't product enough
B	yeah I think like if you've gotta think where we've come from I understand whatever you're saying I agree with it but if I think the reason why it's gone on is cos
A	mm
B	do you know what I mean?
A	mm
B	and made that transition from nomadic to farming then
A	but we can make a transition beyond it again
B	getting better food and stuff yeah yeah I that's what I think
A	you've got to use technology to get beyond
B	but then
A	still there's
B	over thousands of years of that happening you then have things like religion in the mix and they say like in the Bible that you have erm
A	what were we talking about again I've just forgotten
B	er er er why all like erm our treatment on animals and why things meat
A	yeah
B	you'd rather pay more
A	but you were saying not everyone could have organic food but to a certain degree if everyone had a little plot of land that they could farm
B	do you know where they do that?
A	and I mean you could product your own organic food and if you didn't do that and you still did mass-produce it then just by the fact that we did it
B	is that looked up in the internet?
A	because they're not using pesticides and it's cheaper to do it this way etcetera etcetera but I mean if you mass-produced organic food
B	mm
A	it would bring the price down because you're doing more of it
B	mm
A	er the but the problem is you can't be organic either because
B	well what you should do is have you go the internet?
A	cos the the ground is already polluted
B	in Cuba they in Cuba I think when they had some issue over their fucking government or whatever they were going to be cut off from a major supplier so the government initiated this thing so it's like allotments but it's done on like you're fucking doing it sort of scale
A	yeah
B	and it's it produces like loads of food for everyone on the island
A	yeah
B	it's just done on a it all depends though where it's
A	mm
B	and propagate like erm yeah what's the word? your propaganda and everything to influence everyone
A	propagate
B	into that that way of thinking
A	mm
B	so really
A	I'm not against that personally
B	mm I know but you say if someone was
A	mm
B	and they did it in a situation where they were gonna go to war and people were gonna die so we've gone through that
A	oh no we have
B	we get but now as we've got so many people on this island that if we tried that we wouldn't feed everyone
A	no no there are much too many people
B	more more of our cereals and grains come from Russia
A	yeah but it but it bothers me though that we
B	we don't product enough food this is why the guy said you can't go organic
A	yeah we obviously import
B	because you don't produce enough food
A	everything pretty much
B	most of our pork comes from Denmark
A	but doesn't it bother you that I mean I know that like you go and you buy potatoes and it's from Israel or somewhere like that and you're just like
B	mm
A	well why? English is perfect potato-growing land and what I don't what I find strange when I fly in
B	mm but I think it's not just that though
A	it's not only the areas of living and it's like
B	now like now I mean like I work as a gardener there is loads of factors what you can take into account first of all you've got the weather and the weather is changing
A	yeah
B	and then also there is loads of like
A	but you can control quite a bit of this they've got the technology now to to farm up
B	hang on hang on let me finish mate there's loads of stuff
A	not just farm along to farm up
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah so some people are doing that yeah some people are doing that but there's loads of stuff what can affect plants mate loads of okay?
A	no of course I'm not saying
B	and then they do make they do breed like cultivars which are resistant to certain diseases but you've got to think there's not just diseases above ground there's below ground loads of things going to factor it
A	yeah
B	so they do develop and that's why people are pushing for genetically modified crops
A	mm
B	and some people are against it I agree with what you're saying but we haven't refined it that yet
A	we don't have the technology yet to properly do it we don't have the mastery over the land
B	I think and if more emphasis was put on Ray Mears made a good point man like I remember
A	mm
B	we lose more species to like
A	Basque as in like the country?
B	fucking pigeons it's like the British Association for Shooting and
A	that's in northern Spain Basque?
B	no no you're thinking of Basque isn't it
A	Basque yeah Basque
B	I'm thinking of Basc B A S C
A	oh okay sorry
B	anyway
A	yeah
B	most shooters and like game keepers who people think destroyed
A	oh okay
B	but my this what he was saying about farming that it just destroys more habitat think how many woods ever everything's lost just for farmland
A	mm
B	to grow one type of crop
A	obviously
B	so he was saying people are happy thinking how the farmers
A	but what I'm saying about having a small organic garden per community or whatever
B	mm
A	if you took England when I was saying when you're flying in and it we're all living very close together and under the illusion that you know we're having to import in all this stuff and we can't grow very much but yet I see fields everywhere which makes me think if you just spread out where we live so instead of us living
B	yeah but mate what you're seeing is not all edible
A	as not together but a lot more like the States more like America where they all have detached houses and
B	oh what you're saying is if everyone grows yeah but
A	and then if you grew
B	it's it's making the money as well it's making the money
A	if you had a plot of land between your small community or something
B	oh well grow enough food for you to survive the year? I think that's a lot harder than what you think mate
A	no enough food to supplement so you could
B	thinking you'd rather see
A	your ties got cut to countries because you'd have enough food to carry you through it
B	yes but the population's massive mate
A	yeah I know it is ridiculously big but
B	and what are you gonna feed them?
A	but the country's big
B	what are you gonna feed them?
A	when you look at the space when you fly in that's what I'm saying there's there's so much space
B	but yeah but what are you gonna feed them? well what crops do you think would be good wheat?
A	erm I don't think you need to live off wheat I'm talking about smaller things like the community of like say twenty to thirty to fifty to a hundred people have a small farm that they all manage
B	mm
A	therefore that they don't need to put much time into it because they can still do their job because everyone's managing it
B	yeah
A	and you just had like corn and runner beans and spinach and
B	yeah
A	you know strawberries
B	do you know what that's called? that's called intercropping
A	yeah
B	they do that a lot in er in Europe and stuff
A	I'm just saying it's possible here
B	yeah that is sort of like organic but it's a lot harder than what you think
A	yeah I'm not saying it's easy you'd need to train people in it
B	it's like companion planting cos
A	mm and we need to equitably spread people out
B	you can't just
A	because at the minute we're all just like we can't farm around here where are we gonna walk to? through the
B	mm yeah it's a dream man I don't think you could do that in this country
A	oh no of course by you're allowed to dream aren't you?
B	in some way but that's but that's what I'm saying like
A	I just think
B	you have to have a very on board on board view everyone has to think that
A	no
B	it's quite Communist
B	or or it could be quite Socialist is there any difference between Socialism and Communism?
A	I'm not really sure I'm gonna bring this thing in so we can think talking
B	do you think there's any difference between Socialism and Communism er Communism?
A	I don't think Communism has existed erm in the world outside of traveller societies
B	but do you know what Socialism is then?
A	erm Socialism I find hard to demarcate from Communism I can define Communism and Capitalism
B	would you say Labour's Socialist?
A	I don't care to comment cos I don't
B	well no I think it's just how do you describe Socialism so I'm saying
A	I have an image of Labour from about six to eight years ago
B	well how the NHS and like benefits you all help one another don't you?
A	yeah I mean that's Socialism
B	so yeah
A	having benefits
B	but that could be like
A	yeah
B	cos they pay private healthcare don't they?
A	Obama care
B	but most er people who are
A	yeah
B	so that's why we wanted to bring it in it's a major thing
A	it's terrible trust me all my friends are like you know one single
B	they so but people were saying he was a Communist and and some people were saying he was a socialist
A	mm
B	and they were saying they're the same things
A	they're pretty similar
B	oh yeah I think it's just which way you see
A	yeah but I don't think it is
B	just cos of the cold war
A	yeah
B	but I don't think it is I think it's
A	well they've been using it as a scapegoat to go to war with some countries for so long it's the it's the the universal threat
B	yeah but now they use now they use Islam for extreme now extreme Islam as an excuse
A	yeah
B	yeah I'm hungry man oh mate did I give you that book?
A	erm I think I had a copy
B	did you fuck off
A	or did you lose that book then?
B	I don't know I used to have this book
A	yeah so did I
B	and we used to share books all the time
A	yeah
B	I'm just saying mate that is a blast from the past mate
B	oh mate
A	regardless take it
B	no no no
A	no no take it
B	no no I've read it
A	so? read it again
B	no I never I never read I never read
A	have you tried playing a didgeridoo? it's really hard
B	have you read Born to Run?
A	no
B	oh man I'm gonna buy you that book at the weekend mate that is a good book it's about running it's crazy I never thought I'd read a book about running but
A	did you say you were going to borrow me that book?
B	I'm gonna buy you that book mate
A	oh buy me
B	yeah mate
A	I thought you said you were going to borrow me the book and I was like
B	it's about running and these like these people he will he'll just make you think about running in a completely different way like Tarahumara and Copper Canyons so you can run like eighty miles a day
A	er you told me about eh Copper Canyon mate
B	yeah I mean have you remember watching something called Last Man Standing? Last Man Standing?
A	no I don't think I've seen that
B	oh mate they go to the they go and see this tribe and they play this game where you kick a little ball in flip-flops where you go for miles as a relay team so you're all in a group running together and the British guys know they've just failed and their
A	yeah
A	I don't I don't know it's from Bolivia but I didn't get it from Bolivia so I don't know where it came from
B	how are you meant to blow this thing?
A	relax your mouth
A	you're getting it
A	I can't play it like I haven't played it in ages and I picked it up a bit earlier I got a note out of it but that was about it
B	oh yeah
B	I'm blowing right in
A	yeah I think so
A	that's pretty good
A	really relax your mouth and like almost let your lips do this
A	looser like
A	yeah yeah you get to see it that way
B	just
A	oh don't smell it whatever you do
B	sounds more like an elephant horn
A	sounds like a riding horn
B	a
B	it's getting
B	you've gotta do circular breathing
A	I can't do circular breathing
B	apparently it's you can practice with a glass of water
A	yeah or just with a straw
B	mm
A	there's a couple of other instruments in there
B	is there?
A	yeah there's a rain maker somewhere
B	mm
A	I dunno if this is going to be alright actually I'm gonna
B	mate it's fine there's no pressure
A	well I wasn't trying to cook anything amazing I was trying to use up ingredients
B	a what?
A	a rendang it's an Indonesian slash Malaysian curry it's the best it's the best curry in the world I'm convinced of it it's like beef chunks you high fry them to like sear them and then I use tamarind kaffir lime lemongrass erm a bit of brown sugar goes quite well in it as well that's the only time I add sugar as well I cook sometime with curry but you like you add a lot of coconut cream to it and then cook it really really low for about four hours until right at the end there's like no sauce left it's just like a really thick dark black paste on it or like a kind of dark brown almost reddy sometimes it's really sweet for curries it's really really good
B	yeah
A	and then like erm turn it up really high right at the end to like caramelise it in the beef fat erm or the lamb if you have it
B	yeah
A	it's really really good it's like the best curry in the world
B	sounds nice
A	it's hard to find a restaurant that does it well but like I picked up a recipe and it's my favourite
B	is it spicy?
A	no not really it's got quite a few red chillies in it
B	yeah
A	but maybe the ones that
B	so it's got coconut in it?
A	yeah so that tones it down quite a bit
B	that'll be why it's nice then
A	it's like it's got a spice it's got a lot of clove in it and a lot of cardamom in it and a lot of cinnamon so it gives it a different like flavour
B	I wanna grow some er cardamom plants
A	yeah
B	I try them it's hard to germinate
A	I mean er cardamom and like Norwegian cardamom and lemon cakes they're quite good they're
B	I was just thinking man if anyone listens to this tape recording there's going to be like proper talk about organic living
A	yeah
B	then like us blowing on these instruments then you going on about curry
A	yeah
B	it's gonna be a weird weird
A	yeah
B	it'll be like Godwin listen to that listen to the tape Godwin
A	I'll show you some later that I've got of my family it's weird I've got like five hours already
B	do they?
A	yeah it's like eighteen pound an hour
B	no that's alright
A	to record
B	no yeah
A	on that like I have to do more work on top of it and like think about stuff and like it's possible this recording won't be used if there's too much background noise
B	mm
A	and stuff I've I tried to record in the car and I tried to record outside and it's like too windy
B	yeah
A	the car's got like a constant humming sound in the back and I was cooking with
B	mm
A	kind of makes it like it's unclear and I think that they can't really use it for the the Corpus
B	yeah
A	so I have to like I've got some editing software to like cut out bits and like do whatever
B	I wonder how they made this like carved the the centre
A	yeah I don't know
B	it's one whole bit of wood
A	yeah it's a big crazy
B	like they must have drilled up here
A	yeah
B	but
A	mm
B	it wouldn't be that hard to make that
A	no got some random shit
B	it would be harder to get the right angle for that
A	so many CDs
A	do the trill
B	I don't think I'm blowing it right
A	yeah yeah you are
A	yeah it's not great
A	I think that's cos you have to add one after the other
B	oh right
A	yeah cos otherwise there's too much air coming out
A	you see
A	it's not very good
A	erm yeah as I said
A	I'm not sure if I'll have to cut this out though it might be like
B	oh sorry mate
A	no no that's fine
B	see I got in I was getting into my tribe mode mate
A	it was good
B	I was imagining was an apache just
B	out there
A	taking it away
B	take it away mate
A	yeah
B	getting my groove on
A	yeah so I'm lucky to have got the job though because obviously I needed a job when I was doing my degree and I don't really you know to find a job where I don't actually need to do
B	much
A	I don't you know no I don't need to go for interviews I don't need to go out I don't need to be worrying about I can do it on my own hours or whatever I've just got to meet people I can see it getting difficult
B	it's
A	old people's home
B	or a pub
A	yeah a pub a pub might be a bit noisy
B	yeah
A	or
B	yeah
A	I need to get good on my editing software
B	is that
A	does he have a moustache?
B	yeah there
A	yeah he does
B	yeah for Movember
A	whichever
B	whichever?
A	yeah
B	I'll sit over here
A	eat what you can and eat what you can't
A	right I'm gonna do something
B	do what?
A	hang on no talking might be good to keep it going actually
B	but erm cos Naga chillies I think are meant to be the hottest aren't they?
A	oh it is a bit spicy
B	do you ever go to Naga then?
A	yeah that's in India isn't it?
B	yeah their chillies are really fucking hot
A	yeah I haven't been there but I've heard of it it's
B	on Gordon Ramsay when they were sort of they put them in their eyes
A	it's next to
B	yeah it's like the north isn't it? stuff in the north yeah my parents still like it quite fiery
A	mm some bits of India were
B	yeah
A	don't get sausages in Korea
B	no?
A	no
B	I haven't even had a sausage actually for ages
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's good
B	I normally squeeze the meat and turn it into something else
A	yeah you can make meatballs out of it
B	no it is a bit different why don't you have
A	okay yeah I just thought
B	maybe you could have grated the
A	yeah
B	with cheese in it
A	mm
B	would have been like
A	problem was that
A	my brother doesn't have dairy or something so I couldn't he ate his earlier
B	oh mate does your brother like proper stick to a workout sort of thing?
A	no I don't think it's that I think he just has a bad stomach or something when he eats it
B	oh right you know what I mean?
A	yeah so he's like lacto intolerant or some shit
B	oh right
A	he thinks he's not sure
B	mm might have it slightly
A	he's just trying to avoid it to see
B	apparently a lot of people have like problems with gluten but they just don't realise it it can just give you a bloated or upset stomach and
A	yeah for he has had a bad stomach
B	that's why people like go on
A	yeah
B	you just don't get that bloated feeling from eating fucking white bread or something
A	yeah it's definitely a good idea to
B	yeah yeah
A	I tell you what I'd really to do Sean with travelling man if I could get involved with some research into some pidgin or creole language in some random part of Africa or
B	yeah
A	absolutely amazing
B	did you learn Korean when you were in
A	erm
B	cos I remember you saying actually you was going I'm definitely gonna learn Korean this time
A	yeah
B	mm
A	intensively for about six months and then I just again got really deflated with it
B	yeah
A	really deflated with it
B	I've still done my Greek it means you need
A	mm
A	wow
B	yeah
A	I take it you were doing that on Rosetta Stone?
B	yeah yeah yeah that one you got me
A	I didn't get you that did I?
B	yeah yeah you gave me the crap version
A	oh okay not that erm
B	mm
A	you've got that that bought one on your side
B	I think I've got
A	yeah
B	can't believe I bought that what a lot of money
A	but you use the other you use the one I gave you
A	shit
B	it's not your mum is it?
A	no
A	I think
B	yeah it's definitely your mum
A	it looks like some famous rock star or some sort of
B	or Bonnie Tyler I think
B	it's a lot
A	need to eat it in stages sorry made too much
B	what's in this sauce? it's like a gravy or something
A	yeah
B	it's nice man
A	erm comes up better
B	looks like one of those when you get it from an Indian
A	yeah
B	like the texture
A	like a curry
B	it's spicy that one
B	what was it though?
A	it's not it's not meant to be
B	a fusion of Italian and Indian
B	you could just say
A	yeah
B	it's probably the celery what's giving it that texture I think you can
A	mm
B	tastes nice
B	give me a glug of it
A	no
B	does he not like spice at all?
A	er he likes spice but not you know maybe this would be about his limit maybe
B	probably about my limit
A	yeah
B	yeah I think if if things just get too spicy just there's no flavour apart from spice
A	you can get quite a bit spicier than this and still have flavour I think
B	I don't know
A	sorry
B	well
A	I cooked the wrong thing
B	oh no no
A	I blame the chillies
B	no I mean no I like middle eastern food cos it's it's got spice and stuff so it's just when you can
A	no
B	do you know what I mean? like that sort of spiciness that er he
A	mm parts of India like you couldn't I couldn't eat there
A	it was so so hot to a point where I thought I was you know getting worried that I couldn't eat like it was just blip blisteringly hot
B	chillies there they're really spicy so I mean I like mussels yeah with ginger coriander and chilli it's proper nice mate
A	mm
B	and it's like spicy but it's not like just too unbearable do you know what I mean?
A	I don't like mussels

A	mussels cos I don't even like the taste and I'm certainly not gonna
B	they can grow them in erm in artificial environments
A	mm
B	well it's so soft
A	it's horrible
B	oh it's so soft though there's no texture to it it's so soft like if you over cook them they're chewy
A	mm
B	mm
