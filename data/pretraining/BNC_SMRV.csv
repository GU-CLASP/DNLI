C	I don't know if it worked
C	cos I tried to do it with erm another computer that has an old er I tried to do it with my other with the laptop that we have
A	yeah
C	and because the laptop that we have
A	yeah
C	so it
A	oh damn
C	cos like our version of it was old so it was not
A	it sucks oh
C	you've what?
A	listening to Miss
C	what's she done?
A	and it's like she's done everything apparently cos she
C	working on what?
A	dunno staff shit she said er she's erm she's like not designing but like working on the new GCSE and A level syllabus
C	oh yeah
A	it's like going back to what it used to be or something like that
C	have you seen the new A level syllabuses?
A	no oh what for
C	yeah the the ones that they
A	I've I've er er like my teachers have talked about it in history but that's it
C	I think
A	really?
C	and maybe biology Miss
A	yeah
C	mm
A	do you like our course now?
C	it's okay
A	uhu
C	I dunno I haven't I haven't I haven't done much revision
A	yeah
C	I don't know what we're going to study all I know that Miss
A	twenty-seven?
C	yeah
A	shit
C	we only need to know like three but she's
A	you only need to know three?
C	yeah
A	but she's teaching you an extra twenty-four?
A	that seems like a pretty big proportion that she's er
C	I I dunno I think she's very reasonable she's not like Miss
A	yeah
A	but I like that though it's like
C	no but Miss
A	in a focused way like Miss
C	yeah kind of
A	at least will get us to the point
C	yeah yeah she gets us to a point
A	she will just go on it
C	Miss
A	yeah
C	which of everything that she's taught us we actually need to know
A	oh I see yeah yeah yeah
B	I swear some exams they just put in some random stuff that they think students should know but it's not on the syllabus
C	erm
C	for biology?
C	chemistry is is like so yeah chemistry is like that cos like chemistry's better cos they they teach you and then you have to apply the principles to other stuff that you haven't ever heard of before
A	yeah I know
C	but it's so difficult
A	I'm so glad I didn't take chemistry
C	chemistry is
A	all I ever hear is just complaints about it
C	it's so it's it's I dunno I find it really difficult
A	yeah
C	mm
A	about erm yeah look er that's my EPQ stuff er
B	what was your EPQ on?
A	so the how humanity should respond to the poverty in the Balkans so Balkans six main countries from Montenegro and Kosovo Bosnia-Herzegovina er Macedonia and er just because of wars in the nineteen nineties and circumstances they're really poor countries and they've got lots high levels of poverty erm so they're involved in you know the migrant
C	uhu
A	and the European Union is obviously reluctant to accept them cos oh we've got enough problems you know? look at Greece look at erm Yugoslavia look at erm Bulgaria look at all those problems and erm you know
C	uhu
A	and er yeah I wanted like do
C	what's a biometric passport?
A	no idea
C	it says
A	er
C	Albanians will be allowed to go around the Schengen Area if they have a biometric passport
A	erm
B	Albanian boys are buff
B	I just had to say that
A	er
C	I've never met anyone
B	I know like I know like two that are buff
C	I don't know anyone from Albania
C	out of all the Albanian people you know
B	er no those are the only two Albanian boys
B	I know and they both go well one of them goes to
C	oh wow
A	and are they both buff?
C	so a hundred percent of Albanian people you know
A	hundred percent
A	erm it's probably to do with because people are trying to move so
C	why are why does Macedonia
A	I think it's to do with fingerprints and stuff but yeah
C	why does Macedonia why does why do Greece and Macedonia don't get on?
A	so erm the the long story is that erm Macedonia recognises itself as Macedonia
C	yeah
A	and so do ninety percent of countries in the world
C	uhu
A	but then Greece doesn't recognise it it recognises it as a you know the republic of Yugoslavia
C	Former Yugoslavia Republic
A	yeah
C	of Macedonia
A	exactly erm and they don't accept it as that and so every time that any procedure to get them into the EU is you know brought up
C	yeah
A	they bring up the issue of their name
C	yeah
A	and because Greece
B	that sounds so childish
A	it is
B	if you think about it
A	it really is
A	it's so ridiculous and like I was looking on Wikipedia it's been going on for like twenty years and every single time they just bring up the issue of its name and because Greece is in the EU it gets an automatic
C	so it's just because of its name?
A	but the long story er the short story is that they don't want they don't want Macedonia in because as many EU countries they wanna protect their own interests
C	uhu
A	if they bring in Macedonia look at all the the aid that is going into Greece they don't want they don't want the European Union to look at oh look there's lots of countries around here we need to distribute aid between all of them
C	yeah
A	you know it's just them being selfish is er that's that's an opinion but
C	oh
A	basically they're being selfish and they don't want to er
C	Macedonia why don't they just make naming Greek different?
A	because they want to stop them getting into the EU erm it's just some long
C	that's weird
A	political statement about it's really every other country in the world accepts it as erm well not every other country but
C	accept what?
A	most countries in the world accept it as Macedonia but it's just Greece but
C	and Kosovo isn't recognised by five countries
A	yeah
C	by five member states
A	as as an independent state
C	so and it seems Serbia doesn't recognise it
A	lots of these I mean this is the stuff we're doing er in history but it's just a geopolitically sensitive area
C	mm
A	erm the Prussian Empire
C	uhu
A	and then there was an Austro-Hungarian Empire Austria and Hungary
C	uhu
A	and so they started ended up through a series of wars er dividing up this area so Montenegro was formed purely to stop Serbia from getting access to this sea I dunno er there's either it's the Mediterranean or the Black Sea or the I dunno the this is the Adriatic Sea sorry
C	yeah
A	erm so they simply didn't wanna give Serbia access to this body of water
C	okay
A	obviously for trade purposes so it was purely created and recognised as an independent state because of that reason erm and so you can understand why some people are annoyed and pissed when they suddenly start demanding aid because erm because some countries don't recognise it or they want to protect their own interests it's just a difficult situation do you want a hoody? are you cold?
C	no it's fine I have it's cos I remember
A	yeah
C	Kosovo
A	uhu
C	of what er Kosovo he just and he was just basically there are loads of Albanian immigrants
A	oh yeah?
C	who came to the area and they
A	oh I see
C	so they basically overpopulated it
A	yeah
C	so he sort of said that they were kind of like settlers and stuff
A	mm
C	rather than actually living there
A	yeah there's a lot of erm sort of
B	oh yeah I've heard about that
A	they're just highly dispersed around Europe
C	yeah
A	and erm
C	like those people they were killed in the Holocaust weren't they? like
A	mm
C	three quarters of their population
A	yeah yeah yeah those kind of gypsies
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	er
C	well you shouldn't call them gypsies you should call them
A	no no no it it's like slang term sorry but they're called gypsies erm and er and so I'm just trying to look at the reasons why
C	but you should don't shouldn't you need to know statistics and stuff?
A	yeah yeah so I'm gonna include statistics on the what should the EU do? because they've done all these these er programmes to see how different erm programmes work
C	mm
A	and it's the poverty in these areas they're a lot more rural than urban poverty
C	uhu
A	so you know there's programmes er you know look at the way that agriculture has changed in the last ten years there is you know all the Fairtrade stuff that that's going on because it's people aren't getting paid enough
C	yeah
A	erm and it's not just unemployment it's erm it's er er it's it's it's the er the amount that these jobs are paid so so the as in there's not a direct correlation to being employed and not being poor so if you can still be employed but be be poor in these areas
C	yeah
A	it's about how well paid these jobs are
C	mm
A	cos some of these these jobs are underfunded or they're not paid enough erm so yeah I'm trying to combine all those factors for the
C	when did you start your EPQ?
A	this morning basically
C	oh
A	but no I doubt
C	no when did you sign up for it?
A	oh er end of last year summer last year and then er we started it this year basically start of this year but I haven't done that much everyone does it this half-term basically
C	oh
A	erm
A	some
B	physics
A	physics shit
A	some er
B	that was the reason that
A	if everything was if
B	I taught him how to use a book note
A	we were in a quantum world
C	oh
C	oh Miss
A	erm
C	if everything
A	if everything if we were in a quantum world what would it be like? or something like that
C	wow
B	yeah something like that
A	I'm not pretending to understand it but he he's got
B	yeah it's probably like that
A	he's got
C	something complicated
B	I don't understand it
C	if you did an EPQ
B	erm probably wealth inequality
C	in where?
B	erm I'd probably do
A	do world
B	yeah I'd probably do world
A	global society oh but it
B	but I'd wanna focus more on Africa
C	Africa where in Africa?
B	maybe Kenya probably Kenya
C	Kenya Kenya or eastern Africa or just Kenya?
B	just Kenya no cos the rest of east Africa would drag me
B	down with them
A	oh my god
C	I think I would probably have done erm I was gonna sign up for it but then I thought I was gonna have to leave I was gonna I was gonna leave remember?
A	oh right yeah I mean it's just kind of like
A	I'm doing it cos I'm really interested in it it's gonna help
C	yeah
A	but and I just you'd be really interested in it but like the number of people that are doing like stuff for the sake of it like stuff on the NHS that
C	cos the
A	it'll look good on their personal statement
C	cos a lot of the people that
C	the cos like a few few quite how many of the people doing are the ones that out how many of them are early applicants?
A	erm
B	he dropped out of it he
C	he dropped out? oh
B	he signed up for it first
C	uhu
B	and now he's not doing it
A	yeah he dropped out
B	he said it's too much work and he doesn't wanna he's not that interested in it
C	mm
A	that's fair enough er quite a lot basically I could show you the list er cos they're really interesting topics I mean good topics erm
C	I wanna see what people are doing
A	yeah and
C	and she's she's doing it on artificial intelligence isn't she?
A	er yeah
C	yeah
A	but she genuinely she is like
C	yeah she is actually interested in that cos she's been talking about that
A	she's like really mad into it
B	yeah that's true that's true

A	like four hundred pounds

A	and then er
C	mm
A	there's the PowerPoint
C	do you know how you want to study human sciences
A	uhu
C	what are you interested in?
A	erm
C	no I mean erm what field are you interested in? what what specific topic?
A	so erm
C	but which topic do you
A	pre-teens
C	are you most interested in?
A	probably
C	so like lots of psychological
A	yeah but not just but I don't think you can consider it just from a psychological
C	uhu
A	drives people erm I'm mediocrely interested in ethics on that side of it cos you when you start to consider what people why people do things if we get that's philosophy
C	uhu
A	erm I want a really strong biological background in it because I think that's important for I'd say just with people but I think it would be really useful as a degree because there's a certain stigma towards people that have science degrees that can be used as a you know it's more enabling than just an arts degree sometimes erm and what else am I interested in?
C	right
A	yeah international relations and stuff like that
C	you are taking a gap year aren't you?
B	I don't know
C	you don't know? are you gonna apply?

B	personal statement
C	for what?
B	international development
C	er international development where?

C	SOAS you could try and get into SOAS
C	but
B	it's like A A A
C	no but the thing is remember that guy do you were you there?
B	that guy yeah I know what you're talking about
C	yeah
B	I'm not that guy
A	right
C	you can be that guy
B	no
C	man you're always talking about that guy you are that guy
B	I just don't wanna think I don't wanna stress myself up about it too much but I know I have to do stuff so I I
A	you've got to think about it
C	mm
B	I know I know
A	you've got to you've gotta decide to

C	well I don't know cos I haven't researched it
A	okay
A	fair enough
A	so what's the bullshit about the biology course? what do you not like?
C	er it's just like so stupid like the thing we have to fill in the blanks and shit during exams and like
A	right
C	you basically don't need to learn anything you can just memorise the past erm paper erm
A	you could just not like the way that they're taught at erm assessed and that

B	if you guys met my mum yeah she would actually just say it and you guys
A	we should ask
B	it would it would be it would be over it would actually be over
B	it would be over
C	yeah
A	we can do it as that but I think
B	mm
A	designing a PowerPoint and then so the first week we can during the Tuesday session maybe we could discuss it a bit then the next Tuesday cos the first session's the next Wednesday so we could practise it on the Tuesday as well as I need to just present it to Miss
A	I've
C	we haven't decided? oh doggy
A	here boy here boy
A	ah
B	don't do this to me
A	don't don't worry he doesn't care erm alright so I'm discussing stuff with Miss
C	well what if he started licking the chocolate and he had a fit?
A	no I think it takes time for them to get indigestion or whatever they have
C	mm
A	so people wanna talk about mental health and erm I think and
C	uhu
A	she
C	uhu
A	so what do we get from fulfilment from and what are you know tying in the idea of what er what are humans? what do we get fulfilment from? erm so that way you can bring in health erm you can bring in what it means to be humanity you know humanity you can bring in aid work humanitarian concerns so how how er you know some ideas of what how you get fulfilment so we can have like maybe break it into three categories or something and then we can just talk about each one erm
C	okay
A	that's connected to wellbeing because you're you're explaining how people can be better off
C	and
A	erm
C	and we're not linking it to whatever charity we chose to?
A	erm
A	erm
C	did we not choose a charity?
A	no
C	okay
A	erm I think I think rather than just choosing one we'll just work through the year as it comes
C	yeah
A	because we don't fully know what we're gonna do yet
C	sure
A	erm
C	uhu
A	there's a focus on the individual and yourself
C	uhu
A	the self but a lot of the time we get fulfilment from being with other people or from helping other people
C	yeah
A	whereas that's not something that's usually taught or discussed and told to people so you know putting that message across that volunteering and being with friends and stuff like that can give you just as much fulfilment as what you think personal fulfilment is right?
C	uhu
A	erm
C	yeah
A	so show a series of images and just ask what this means to them what they think
C	yeah
A	get the response from that so that's a broken nail
C	okay
A	so think how that connects to your wellbeing I mean a lot of people would get very upset if they broke a nail does it actually impact your health? or what about other sides of wellbeing in terms of erm
C	uhu
A	erm I think that's just arguing with people
C	ah
A	from a oil spill
C	yeah
A	so as I said we can just use whatever we want but that's what she tends to use so maybe starting off with that when we ask the question what does it mean to be fulfilled or how do you feel fulfilled in your life then we go through those maybe discuss it a little bit erm
C	and so then we're just gonna sort of link that to the idea of humanitarian action
A	yeah so
C	yeah
A	I erm
C	did you hear her snore?
A	yeah
C	cute
C	er?
C	oh the dog's all wet now
A	oh no
B	erm ask me if I should follow oh
C	anyway but you you
A	erm but yeah just relate that to how people feel fulfilment one thing she did er I'm not saying we should do it but anyway she played two different songs during while she went through the images for the first one was you know that Everybody Hurts song? erm I dunno who it's by
C	sing it
A	just a really
B	oh yeah yeah
C	no I
B	you know it trust me
A	okay?
C	I think apparently I know it
A	er it's a sad song
C	okay
A	but then there's like a happy song about sunshine
C	what's the happy song?
A	or something I don't I don't I don't remember what it was
C	sing it please
C	we only have like
A	half an hour
C	half an hour
A	and you know
B	is this gonna do during registration?
A	yeah
B	on I think it's
A	Wednesday Thursday
C	the thing is realistically
A	and Tuesday
C	in registration you don't have half an hour
A	we've got like fifteen minutes to be honest
C	yeah
A	I don't I don't want us to have too much content and
C	yeah
A	I'd rather if we go over we just encourage more discussion or something
C	so yeah that's okay yeah
A	erm
C	so we're just gonna talk about how
A	yeah
C	we link fulfilment towards
A	so yeah
C	whatever we want
A	the overall theme is personal fulfilment we talk about different
C	mm
A	erm
C	mm
A	stuff all that mental wellbeing talking about more about mental health like differentiated from anxiety what do you think we can talk about in that respect? I think the point there we're trying to make is that not many people see it as a serious issue
B	yeah
A	they don't see it as
B	mm
A	as actually real
B	yeah that's true
A	but I think those mental illnesses are heavily misunderstood so maybe just a few minutes on what it actually is and what it actually feels to be mentally
C	the thing is like if we just play a video
A	yeah
C	what's the point of having a presentation?
A	exactly yeah exactly
C	but erm if we're doing it about mental health we could easily link it to a charity
A	yeah
C	we could make it kind of I don't know how we would do it cos what would we talk about about
A	it's brain stuff
C	mental health?
A	it's brain stuff erm just er what it means to
C	are we talking about like mental health in general statistics in the UK or how it relates to them?
A	how it relates to them is important maybe I mean who are we targeting? are we just want anyone who suffers from that any anything like that to know it's okay maybe to know that they can get help
C	yeah
A	cos we can talk about like there's people in school like Mrs
C	outside of school they could
A	Mrs
C	I guess cos our cos er everyone would be old enough to make their own doctor's appointment and stuff so they
A	uhu
C	really need to go through
A	yeah
C	external bodies
A	exactly
C	like our school
A	yeah er
B	wait what years will we be doing this to?
C	our year
A	this will just be sixth form
C	yeah
A	but er the idea was the other years but that'll be later in the term so
B	oh
A	we're gonna pitch it differently hopefully obviously you know sixth formers sixth formers are smart I mean
C	well
A	we don't need to spoon-feed them basic primary school information but I still think there's a misunderstanding about mental health
C	yeah
A	so erm
C	you're breathing very loudly
A	er?
C	you're breathing very loudly
A	sorry
C	no it I don't mind it's
C	I just I was just mentioning it
B	I didn't notice
A	okay personal stuff on there are you still cold? do you want my hoody?
C	no I'm fine
A	right so personal fulfilment so we're talking about health erm
C	er no
A	erm social fulfilment?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm obviously this this can all be worked on but
B	it still looks nice to be honest
A	it's so short there
B	it actually I actually think it does yeah
A	that doesn't look
C	what's that word? altruism?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	or maybe just be altruistic to help yourself not just to help other people I think maybe there's a there's too much of a focus on oh you know it's all about helping that poor kid in Africa what about the benefits you get yourself from it? so that's kind of what Miss
C	mm
A	but so maybe we could link in the benefits of volunteering? er probably not for the year thirteens cos they've done most of that but getting that message through to year twelve is important
C	yeah
A	cos this is the time that they have they don't have the time but they have time now and that's gonna be vital when they
C	well this is when they're still enthusiastic about
A	yeah basically so
A	online but
B	I don't need
A	er
A	really?
A	erm so just you get fulfilment from from helping other people and then there's loads of stats maybe but I don't want it to just be filled with oh ninety percent of blah blah blah I want it to be meaningful but I think there are relevant stats stats about volunteering like erm genuinely makes you feel better
C	mm
A	you're less likely to be depressed and stuff like that erm so maybe a few stats
B	why are you laughing?
C	dunno
B	it's serious
unknown_female	I'm just thinking about how serious this is
C	ouch ouch
A	is that a spider?
B	did that hurt?
A	in your hair?
B	does that hurt?
C	cos you're pulling my hair
B	oh sorry
C	what would you do if Mrs
A	go oh hi guys er
B	I didn't put that there
C	what other crap have you put on my head?
A	who else put it there?
C	is that it? was it just the orange peel?
A	yeah
B	in one whole piece wow
A	oh Mr
A	miss you ah
C	he would have he would have been er my form tutor
A	no way
C	yeah
B	no no way

C	no they they like they usually just let me do whatever
B	you're you always say your parents are strict I don't think your parents are strict
C	my parents aren't that
B	on what I've seen

A	oh
B	seriously though where did you find that?
A	where did we find him yeah?
B	I can't believe you never used to like
A	you don't understand
C	you don't understand what he was like
A	oh my god
A	ah
B	Spain is gonna be a good trip
A	er did you tell
C	oh yeah
A	at the
C	my I
B	did they say no?
C	no I asked my dad and
B	so he said no?
C	no but then er then my
C	then he then he
A	no
C	called me over and she was like and he was like what do you think about it? and she was like yeah it sounds like a good idea
A	yeah
C	and
B	ah
A	ah
A	mum gold
B	your mum's actually so cute
B	oh your mum is actually so cute I remember
C	what? no
B	I dunno she said you know we went for that open day once?
C	oh yeah yeah saw us yeah yeah
B	and we saw your dad yeah and your sister
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	and then er she mentioned it
C	yeah
B	and it was just so cute
C	oh
C	mm I don't think my sister knows
A	knows what?
B	she doesn't
C	if any of you guys yeah doesn't know any of the people that I hang out with
A	ah
C	she vaguely knows that
B	and I remember the time when I came to your house and she thought I was a guy and so she put on a
C	what?
B	a a
B	yeah and then when she actually saw me
C	yeah
B	she realised
C	cheers ah
A	ah
B	she probably thought I was girlfriend then
A	so what do you guys what what see yourself in twenty years in a happy life? how would you feel you are fulfilled in what ways? how about spiritual fulfilment? since there's er it says a large
A	religious people in our school if you think that's worth talking about I was talking to Miss
C	yeah
A	Mr
B	who doesn't agree with it?
A	Mr
C	oh
B	oh
C	why?
A	really receptive to it er I'm not
C	oh
A	and she was making the point that you know that
C	Hinduism
A	Hinduism but they know how to do the ritual stuff
C	yeah
A	so that's why she teaches Smart's Dimensions because there's so much more to religion than just the ritual stuff erm you know I totally agree with that cos you know in Christianity you know you know how to accept communion but you don't know what it I didn't know what communion meant I think I've only realised it in like the last few weeks and I've been taking it for years so
C	mm
A	and only now am I really understanding what spiritual fulfilment is what people get out of it
C	mm
A	so maybe I dunno what's what's an issue with related in our school?
C	what's an issue with religion?
A	yeah
C	a deep issue?
A	as as in like we're trying to be humanitarian we're trying to improve the things in our school
C	well I remember in the documentary there was the guy who
A	walked about
C	it was Britain is Britain
B	is Britain still racist? I saw that one yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah there was the Jewish guy and then he went to a Muslim area
A	yeah
C	which is affecting people you know
A	yeah
C	I saw that bit
A	and I see antisemitism everywhere in our school
C	yeah
A	do you think maybe so interreligious relations? do you think maybe explaining
C	it's so weird to hear my dad talk about Jewish people and Judaism
A	yeah?
C	and my sister they have so such a weird
A	in what way? well what do they believe?
C	I don't know it's just like the thing is like my dad was like you know what? when you sit down with Jews some of them are okay
C	it's just like what?
C	it's so
A	oh god
C	so weird
A	yeah
C	they just I don't know what they think they just think
C	I don't know
A	do you think that's been
B	do you think then
A	exacerbated by the?
B	do you think do they know a lot of Jews though? cos sometimes when you
C	no no
B	don't when you don't know a people
A	absolutely
B	you just assume
C	yeah I don't think they know anyone that's Jewish
A	yeah
C	I don't think I've met anyone that's Jewish
A	seen Jewish that's it
B	I don't think I've met anyone that's Jewish
A	yeah
A	even if you did meet a Jew how do they have anything to do with what's going on in Palestine or Israel?
C	true but the thing is that a lot of erm synagogues are very sort of
A	they're very what?
C	well it depends actually
A	so that they
C	it depends completely but quite a
B	yeah they are I've seen it on Twitter don't know
C	yeah
A	but so what? cos I don't think
A	Twitter's a good representative sample of like
C	the thing is
B	no Twitter is
C	in in in some ways it is because
B	Twitter is trust me
A	yeah in some ways
C	people will have the confidence to say that what they won't
B	cos some people in real life
A	I know
B	they don't speak but on Twitter is when they come out and show
A	I know but that doesn't mean that
A	you can use it as a representative
C	but also
B	yeah true
C	it's it's sort of like a weird sort of sample where you don't
A	yeah basically
C	like you get such a weird number of people for from such varying demographics so it's not really
A	absolutely
B	mm true
A	it's as long as it's used in the right way like
C	the thing is we're not doing a
A	absolutely not
C	so
A	yeah
C	seeing what people think
A	but
B	yeah but I don't know any Jews so the only place I have actually heard of any say anything is on Twitter
A	mm
C	the think is that like
A	or how can we help to encourage a conversation about that?
C	the thing is like
B	mm
C	like thirty percent of our school's like Muslim
A	yeah
C	out of that thirty percent how many of them know anything about the Israel Palestine conflict?
A	I know
C	and out of those people
A	yeah it's true yeah
C	how many of them are antisemitic?
A	right
C	cos most of
C	stems from that conflict
A	yeah
C	rather than anything else
B	yeah that's true
A	or do you think it's do you think it's it it it's encouraged by
C	well they're only
A	not taught but
C	no I think
A	that that it's expressed in that way?
C	before the Israel Palestine conflict there wasn't there was no real there antisemitism wasn't a major problem between Muslim and Jewish communities
A	right
C	before that it was mainly just Christians and Jews who had a lot of conflict
A	yeah
C	but now it's Muslims and Jews because of about because of that
B	mm
A	so do you think maybe highlighting that fact might open people's minds more?
C	the thing is
A	to the fact
C	how large of a demographic er if we're trying to do something which is gonna
A	we're just doing it for sixth form
C	yeah I know but I mean erm in each class there's only gonna be a certain number of people who are actually gonna know what we're talking about and a certain number of people who
C	are gonna be
A	but I think
C	antisemitic
A	everyone
B	that's true
A	knows that something's going on I mean we're not doing it on the that crisis but we can
C	yeah
A	everyone knows that something's going on in Palestine and it's something to do with Muslims and Jews
C	the thing is er
A	and yeah go on
C	like
A	complex
C	not
A	right
C	Islamophobia or just general racism or this stigma against immigrants and stuff
A	how about relating the way that Muslims probably feel marginalised you know I was reading this open letter to Muslims about homosexuality and it was just like think of the way that your sister feels your sister when she wears hijab or your brother your bearded brother how do they feel marginalised and
C	yeah I guess so yeah
A	and then think of the way that you talk about Jews who have may have necessarily not connection with the Israel Israeli government's decisions on what their foreign policy is
C	yeah
A	erm I mean that's just one slant in don't know if that's the right one
C	cos that's kind of like how the documentary was saying cos that documentary was saying like it dealt with like four different groups of people
A	yeah
C	but it sort of used it used the same methods for all of them so it sort of allowed you
A	uhu
C	to like if you identified with one group you could sort of see how it affected the other group in the same way
A	oh yeah
B	yeah that's true
A	and they made that lady black
C	and they made that lady black
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and they made her
C	I didn't see that part no
A	the it was sick
B	it was near it was near the end her brain thought that she was black or something
A	so
B	yeah
A	and they had a fake black hand here
C	yeah
A	they stroked they didn't allow her to see her own hand but they
C	yeah
A	stroked er part of say this part
C	yeah
A	and they stroked it on the same black hand
C	yeah
A	so it principally made her think that her hand was black
C	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and then
C	yeah
A	they also erm they also did some like facial recognition thing to make her think that she was black and then they did that same test they er
A	IA test or whatever
A	but erm so
B	I might come up with slight
B	no how do you think I feel? it's okay for you yeah?
