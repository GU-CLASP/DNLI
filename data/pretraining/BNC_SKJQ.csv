B	no
A	when did you lose it?
B	boot fair
A	oh yeah
B	it was only it had no camera on it just ordinary one
A	that one's alright though isn't it? a similar sort of thing
B	yeah
A	just a cheap phone
B	just a cheap phone that's all sometimes you get reception sometimes you don't it works down at
A	that's this house though isn't it?
B	when I'm fishing
A	oh does it?
B	yeah
A	ah it's just this house that doesn't get reception
B	yeah really clear down there
A	it's surprising you'd think on the coast I dunno it'd be too windy or something
B	no it's alright
A	mm
B	in a dippy dip
A	when's the last time you went fishing?
B	cor blimey four weeks ago
A	you didn't catch anything did you? and mum was planning a fish supper and
B	yeah
A	you had to get KFC
B	caught a cold
A	oh did you?
B	no it was about the only thing we did catch that day that was a waste of money Jesus
A	who'd you go with? you went on your own?
B	yeah trouble is time you put your petrol in and get your bait you're looking at forty-five fifty quid
A	cor
B	just for the day
A	yeah
B	only an hour
A	mm
B	an hour and ten minutes
A	it's enough in petrol though isn't it?
B	yeah
A	trying to catch dinner
B	yeah catch something
A	mm might have to come with you sometime
B	yeah
A	I haven't got as much time as I
B	not at this time you won't will you?
A	with these
B	you can fish all the time
A	ah
B	winter's better when the cod's about
A	oh is it?
B	yeah it don't matter about that does it? got all the gear
A	I was thinking that actually with erm
B	eh?
A	do you go when you ride your bike in the rain do you ever wear waterproofs?
B	I don't go in the rain if I can help it
A	yeah it's probably not a good idea is it?
B	well I've got them but you can't it's too much
A	designed for fishing aren't they yours?
B	yeah
A	I think it's just a receipt for something dad
B	yeah so next week we'll have to load the van up early early
A	mm
B	be just one I said to mum how the hell am I going to get over there to pick it up? unless I can leave the car there that day
A	you should be able to shouldn't you? isn't that the whole idea?
B	yeah I'll see leave the old car there lock it up mum could take the rest to work
A	yeah take the
B	get the driveway clear
A	yeah
B	and I can back the van in we can load it up whatever we got
A	what about
B	yeah
A	he will be?
B	yeah
A	but he has to sign on in the afternoon?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	but he'll have
A	ah
B	I'll have taken the satnav though cos I don't wanna get lost coming back
A	yeah coming back on your own
B	yeah
A	and then just drop the van off and post the keys
B	yeah and pick the car up
A	yeah cos erm you leave it on your property overnight if it gets anything gets happens to it
B	oh I know I ain't having it no I ain't having that that can go back straightaway
A	yeah
B	then I can come away
A	spend the evening sorting the flat out
B	cos I wanna get back cos that's card night and all anyway
A	oh yeah Wednesday night
B	I don't know
A	cos she might
B	no she's working ain't she? yeah
A	but I mean to
B	be another twelve hour shift
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	scratches or
B	it covers it yeah I think it's eighty-five ain't it?
A	it's eighty
B	eighty then there's what the
A	oh is that what they do?
B	yeah so if you use twenty-five quid's worth of diesel you have to put twenty-five back in
A	I'll give you the diesel money
B	well don't worry about that
A	no you're paying enough out although mum'll pay for the rental won't she?
B	yeah course she is
A	but still it's a lot of money
B	it's only the once ain't it?
A	yeah until you have to move it all back out again
B	when you move I mean
A	you'll have to boot it all won't you?
B	I'll say we'll take what we think we need and then let the charity shop have the rest
A	yeah
B	cos time if you think you're gonna hire a van again
A	yeah I suppose so unless I can sell it locally
B	unless you can sell it locally
A	some of the stuff like the stuff
B	are they?
A	there's tables and chairs and stuff they're not gonna let us sell them on or anything
B	I mean the only thing that might be any good at the end of the day is the washing machine
A	washing machine yeah
B	I'd probably get that in the Ford Focus
A	maybe the I reckon I could sell the futon locally even if it's for like thirty quid or something
B	yeah keep it tidy keep it
A	someone will have to collect it but
B	yeah
A	someone'll buy that futons always go
B	I mean all the pots and pans and that I mean
A	yeah once pots and pans are used
B	either chuck them or give them to charity
A	yeah
B	anything electrical
A	I still need
B	microwave well it ain't worth worrying about
A	George Foreman
B	depends where you're gonna end up
A	yeah yeah it does
B	if you need then we'll have to get a van back down there
A	if I go abroad again for a year though
B	get rid of it all
A	see
B	yeah I don't ah get rid of it
A	I still need to get some er some er

B	red one green one yellow one
A	mm
B	it'd be worth a few hundred quid then
A	mm
B	well you got to ain't you? cos I said it ain't worth getting rid of them when
A	yeah I was going I was waiting another couple of minutes
B	you can do mum's Tesco thing can't you?
A	lottery?
B	lottery
A	you want me to do your lottery while I'm in there?
B	oh well I only want a couple of dips
A	you just want two lucky dips?
B	yeah
A	do I just say two and two lucky dips?
B	yeah
A	on a separate ticket?
B	yeah
A	I'll pay for it don't worry
B	two pound each
A	it's two pound a line?
B	yeah
A	I mean I'll still pay for it
B	no well pay you out of that just gimme nick the change
A	no I'll pay for it dad
B	you wanna save your money
A	I think you gave me enough change
B	save your money
A	I don't want your five pounds
B	save your money
A	mm I better be able to buy a single stamp I don't really wanna buy a book of stamps
B	no wonder mum never had any stamps
A	I know she had a couple and then people we don't post stuff that much anymore it's usually online or whatnot isn't it?
B	I don't
A	I don't think you ever have have you dad?
B	no I don't even use the stamps
A	yeah
B	better recharge the
B	no don't waste your money I keep telling you you wanna save it for when you get down to
A	ah might be gone by winter
B	well anything to help out
A	it'll help out in the meantime yeah do a load of shopping I'm tempted to bloody do a load of shopping in Morrisons before I go it's cheaper
B	well do it
A	the nearest supermarket's Sainsbury's
B	I mean
A	although there is a Morrisons down in
B	well yeah
A	no I mean I couldn't buy anything frozen could I?
B	no
A	no I'll just do a shop when we get
B	yeah
A	still
B	eh?
A	I'm only gonna be there those first two nights and then I'm coming you're gonna pick me up to go to
B	yeah well can't be helped can it?
A	no it'll be fine something I mean it's only really well it's Friday night Saturday night
B	yeah
A	his dad might even spend the night
B	yeah
A	if he wants to but then no he can't can he? cos he's got to get that van back by eight thirty
B	well that's it see that's the trouble
A	yeah
B	how much did his van cost?
A	well
B	yeah
B	I just wondered if we did do need that long wheelbase cos a short wheelbase would be better and it's be better for parking
A	it's only gotta be the fit a mattress in it hasn't it? how short is short wheel?
B	no the
A	the futon yeah
B	sofa bed
A	measure it and then look at
B	yeah
A	measure the futon and then I'll look up the measurements of the thing
B	yeah
A	and then if we have to phone them up and change it we'll change it
B	well yeah short wheelbase cos when I when we get down there you might just have a car space to get in and unload
A	yeah
B	yeah it it's only the sofa bed really I mean the mattress'll go in easy
A	mm and the washing machine
B	the washing machine's nothing
A	and some boxes and suitcases
B	yeah be
A	also I was thinking anything like clothes suitcasewise that I mean if there isn't space and there should be space but you can always bring it down in the car
A	yeah
B	plenty of room
A	it might be cheaper to get short based
B	I ain't worried about that it's just I
A	parking?
B	parking
A	yeah I mean I have
B	I mean unloading like you know?
A	I haven't seen that road so that's that's why in a way I think in a way it's better that
B	yeah yeah
A	cos we both have to be there at the same time to sign the contract
B	yeah
A	so you'd both be there with your vans I don't think you could both be outside the house would you?
B	well
A	maybe if enough people have gone to work
B	trouble is once we've unloaded unless I can park in anywhere
A	yeah
B	well you might be able to get outside the house
A	I need to look that up actually because you're gonna want
B	well there's shops there's loads of shops there
A	yeah I know but I mean
B	there up in the corner's a café
A	but it's parking in the meantime
B	yeah yeah
A	I suppose you can park long enough to have something to eat
B	yeah there's always somewhere to find to park
A	can try and contact the agency and ask them what people do when they're parking when they move all their stuff in
B	yeah yeah
A	they might have some er have they got can you park outside the agency did you notice?
B	no it's in the main road
A	er
B	right in the corner
A	they haven't got a car park or anything similar?
B	no no no
A	mm
B	the two girls are upstairs
A	small little operation I suppose
B	yeah
A	it's nearly ten o'clock
B	wanna get up the shop
A	go quickly up the shop
B	get mum's lottery
