A	okay it's green
A	well it's not er green it's red but that means it's green
B	okay but yeah what I was saying tai chi is just for an hour but it's all the way over there by the time I walk back
A	an hour and a half?
B	yeah but it would mean one good session of
A	but is that?
B	keep fit
A	but that's thirty minutes yoga thirty minutes
B	meditation
A	meditation
B	yeah
A	and thirty minutes thirty minutes meditation each side of the yoga is it?
B	I I don't know I don't know
A	cos I I read on her website last night and she was saying that yeah that that's what she does
B	cos I know a lot of meditation things so
A	mm
B	her meditation might not be my cup of tea that's another reason why not to pay for the
A	yeah cos it's a very individual thing
B	yeah but
A	especially when you're in a class
B	mm
A	of up to twenty people can you really meditate in that kind of environment?
B	and she tends to stutter a fair bit doesn't she? I mean erm not stutter but erm
A	well she's kind of vague kind of hyper I mean
B	maybe she'd change in that situation
A	not hyper I mean yeah yeah cos she's got so many ideas going through her head all the time
B	battery? oh no the battery's gone I'm gonna have to run and do the battery are you alright for a minute?
A	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean I'd like to go for coffees and stuff but I can do that with
A	mm
B	or at odd times you know for an hour or so but be back for feeding I want to be back for feeding most nights for bedtime it's a nice time really it's a cuddly time and
A	yeah
B	it's she she needs stability at that time
A	yeah
B	yeah so Tuesday yeah that would mean dinner time plus feeding time and bedtime
A	mm
B	yeah?
A	well yeah no it's fair
B	yeah but you don't usually go out until she's asleep
A	yeah
A	well
B	if I said right I'll put her to bed and then go out
A	well again that's another case to to pay for
B	yeah
A	for the whole semester see how it
B	to see how it goes
A	yeah
B	yeah okay well I've told her I'm doing tai chi it's that's
A	yeah
B	er that is a definite cos I can be back for bedtime with tai chi so
A	what time's that?
B	quarter past five to quarter past six so
A	yeah
B	oh I've gotta think about dinner again always thinking about dinner and what we're gonna feed ourselves
B	it's alright
B	it was all a bit of a mess wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	I did I had a nice lunch
A	you had a nice lunch
B	mm but you don't really get on with
A	no I I like them I don't you know
B	yeah
A	I really do like them I just feel so different
B	mm yeah there's nothing
A	and there's nothing wrong with being different to people
B	mm
A	there's nothing wrong with that at all but I just find conversation quite hard
B	yeah
A	it doesn't flow cos a lot of what they say I I kind of in my head I'm kind of disagreeing with and I don't wanna say anything and I'm sure it's the same with me
B	them yeah
A	and it's just kind of a little bit
B	mm yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	and then judge yourself by other
A	well
B	people?
A	I dunno
B	that's what I feel like you're doing
A	really?
B	and you shouldn't cos you're a great dad you shouldn't
A	yeah
B	but that's what I feel like you're doing with
A	yeah
B	it's different
A	yeah
A	he does make me feel guilty
B	why?
A	well cos he he said that he's not gonna go out at all from now on and you know and cos I'm going out playing music and
A	I dunno and he was saying oh I'm not going out I don't wanna neglect my baby and
B	that's rubbish you don't go out till she's asleep it's rubbish
A	yeah but I I know that he's judging me in that way
B	who cares what he thinks?
A	yeah I know
B	who cares what he thinks?
A	I know
B	I don't
A	I'm just too sensitive
B	yeah but he's not said anything has he?
A	huh?
B	he's not said anything
A	no
B	I can't believe today what a pickle
A	well
B	finalised things didn't it?
A	well we got in okay
B	yeah
A	I thought we were gonna have to get the locksmith
B	well he was a locksmith that guy that came
A	and he was gonna change the locks?
B	yeah he he had his toolbox I dunno if he was gonna change the locks or pick the locks or something he had his toolbox
B	I don't and I couldn't work out whether he'd just walked straight past you guys and gone in the door
A	I didn't see him yeah maybe he went in the back door
B	so I was like hang on a minute wait a minute I'm gonna call my husband and just check that this is the right thing
A	well that's a good job cos
A	she yanked the er the mailbox open
B	whose mail?
A	and it broke the locks of three different people's
A	before she found our key
B	oh my god they're gonna they're gonna be so pissed off aren't they?
A	yeah well I'm glad she did it it wasn't us
B	no
A	but I think she felt that she had to do it because it's kind of her fault well it was her fault
B	which mailbox did she put the key in?
A	she put it in the one that's two above ours or three above ours two or three above ours
B	so not
A	so she broke the one above she broke the one below
B	ah then it was the next one
A	and then she went above and it was in that one
B	I I thought it would be that one because it's two two 0 two and we live at two
A	er yeah
B	and I thought that's the most obvious one she would've put it in
B	and she said no no no no it's not in that one it's in
B	two one 0 two
A	no
B	we were like nobody lives there so that's okay we can break that one open
B	but people do live at two two 0 two
B	so do we have to go and tell them what happened? or?
A	no
B	maybe I should text
A	well is there someone er living in that one?
B	two two 0 two yeah they just moved in
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	er
B	and and below us
A	oh shit
B	below us too
A	I dunno how broken it is but
B	the guy
A	they use you can open any of those mailboxes just by yanking them
B	oh my god the guy below us speaks English so maybe we should go and speak to him and say er oh I dunno or maybe we should ask the
A	er maybe cos you know they might have some really important documents in their
B	yeah
A	and you don't wanna just I mean it's cos it won't close again it's just flapping around
B	yeah
A	I mean mostly yeah I mean
B	but I don't want them to blame us
A	it's probably just junk mail but
B	I don't want them to blame us
A	not us personally no
B	I mean the the nanny
A	maybe we should yeah we should tell them
B	er the cleaner should've the cleaner should've gone up to the flats that she broke the mailboxes of and just told them she's just gone home
A	yeah but that's yeah well it's just that's Chinese isn't it? they don't wanna lose face it was her fuck up
B	well yeah but we should've had a spare key which we've try and organize with the landlady but she didn't
A	mm
B	see
A	yeah well she yeah well she fucked up as well
B	I'll copy your key
A	she said she was gonna get us a key
B	yeah
A	and she didn't
B	well
A	but we can't tell her what's happened because then she'll lose face
B	the landlady?
A	mm
B	landlady knows
A	oh she
B	I phoned the landlady to ask for a key I think
A	does she know we're back?
B	no
A	no we better
B	oh my god I should go and get the phone I bet there's
A	you'd better tell her that we're we're in
B	because I I'm pretty sure maybe it was the landlady that organised the locksmith to come by
A	ah okay well you'd better tell her
B	yeah well I have to go in in now and change the battery quickly do you wanna come with me?
A	er oh yeah
B	just for a minute we can come back outside again
A	okay yeah
B	oh it's nice inside come in
A	yeah it is nice
B	let me just can you close the door for mosquitoes?
A	yeah
B	I'm just gonna run and get the the battery
A	yeah I need the toilet do you think I can go into the toilet?
A	with this?
B	no
B	you can't do that
A	we can get paid for having a piss
B	you can't do you can't do
A	well can you at least talk to me while I have a piss?
B	oh
A	er
B	oh god what a palaver hey?
A	oh
B	I should check my phone and check
A	well the cleaner's done a nice job anyway she's
B	yeah it does look good
A	glad she's cleaned the floor
B	but she never puts anything back like all those she just stacks things up on the
A	yeah
B	on the thing
A	er
B	let me check my phone erm yeah the landlady knows
A	I think that's that's to show that she's done it you know? she doesn't
B	oh I see yes that is
A	it's a sign to us that what she's done
B	yes that'll be it okay well the landlady hasn't called
A	cos er which shows that she actually values this job
B	what?
A	she values keeping this job
B	yeah
A	is what that shows to me
B	what? that she's piled all the cushions and?
A	yeah I mean she's obviously conscious of right I'll tell them what I've done this and I've done that
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	well you can see she's polished the table
A	if
B	five pound for two hours
A	five pound for two hours
A	no
B	oh
A	yeah but you know she must be very happy with that because for doing that you know what I mean?
B	yeah oh shall we check your computer and the ironing
A	I've checked it
B	oh okay
A	can you erm just hold this? while I I'll do it quietly
B	okay
B	oh you if you use that one you can't flush because
A	oh
B	use the other one huh? well it's just it's right by her bed on the other side of the wall isn't it?
A	still need to change this lightbulb
B	I know
A	yeah shall I whistle?
B	whistle while you work?
A	yeah
B	yeah I'm gonna have a look in the fridge
A	erm
B	what?
A	something quick
B	something quick well mm something quick chips
B	oh did you? cos there's a can of tuna open and some kidney beans we could make a quick little kidney bean salad with tuna and have baked potatoes
B	hang on oh yeah they're lovely potatoes
A	yeah I bought some the other day
B	we could do erm
A	so we can have like a baked potato
B	yeah it will be a late tea but that's alright isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I'm happy with baked potato
A	just a
B	yeah
A	do you wanna go back outside?
B	we'll zap it yeah
A	yeah
B	oh
B	I can't believe that pram incident as well it's
A	mm
B	it was just awful oh god I felt so awful
A	well no
B	they do
A	but that was kind of good it happened in a way you know?
B	mm
A	I just can't believe how quickly that it wasn't even windy
B	no
A	and we took our eyes off it for a fraction of a second
B	mm
A	and the next second it was in the fucking road
B	well not
A	well it was in the
B	in
A	the lay by bit
B	mm
A	could've easily gone the other way and lucky it went down the the dip in the kerb
B	yeah
A	if it had gone over the kerb like the full kerb there'd be really high kerbs there
B	yeah they'd erm
A	that'd have been straight over
B	the whole pram would've fallen over
A	yeah yeah
B	god I was oh god that upset me
A	yeah I mean
B	that upset me so much
A	yeah I know it did
B	yeah
A	but fuck that that was a real lesson wasn't it?
A	no it was weird cos I was watching that video about the pram the other day
B	mm
A	blowing onto the railway tracks
B	the thing is every time I stop I put the brake on
A	yeah
B	it's just that one time
A	well cos it looked flat yeah you know you can't even leave it on a flat area because
B	no
A	it's got such a big kind of er surface area that any slight wind catches it and because it's four wheel drive it's just off
B	yeah
B	no too right it's not
B	well yeah that's why like
A	mm mm
B	at that moment
A	yeah that one time it happens and it ends in tragedy
B	yeah
A	and like can you? oh god it's not even worth thinking about is it?
B	no
B	but I can't believe how good she was she didn't have she didn't have rice porridge tonight
A	no
B	and she had a nice good feed just now
A	yeah
B	but that was because I was quite full because erm cos she hadn't had any for a while luckily she had that banana today she had quite a lot of bananas I think that probably filled her up yeah
B	yeah well I in a way I'm glad that you saw that as well and I didn't just come home one day crying that the pram had like what? a couple of metres away from me but it's just the
A	mm
B	mm
A	but I I just can't believe how it just took off like that
B	mm
A	cos it wasn't windy
B	mm mm
A	it was just a slight breeze
B	yeah
A	jesus man I wonder how many?
B	but er
A	babies
B	yeah
B	but er I am glad that you saw it too because
A	yeah
B	then it becomes like a learning thing for
A	yeah
B	both of us
A	cos it's quite a heavy pram as well you wouldn't think that such a light wind could do that
B	mm
A	I mean it was literally both of us took our eyes off it for literally five seconds
B	yeah we were getting in the car weren't we?
A	yeah
B	getting her ready to get in the car
A	god
B	well
A	whacking the brake on like the first thing we did at
B	yeah
A	I thought oh my god imagine if it happened here
B	yeah but like I said cos it er didn't look like a dangerous
A	no
B	it wasn't er like a dangerous place
A	no but it
B	it didn't seem like a dangerous place
A	no
B	so it was
A	but it it turned into a dangerous place very quickly cos it turned the whole pram round and blew it completely the worst place er
B	turned it round?
A	yeah it was facing one way
B	huh
A	turned it and then it was off
B	oh god I didn't even realize that I just
A	yeah and I was kinda watching it but cos I thought
B	it took a while to click
A	no only like a couple of seconds but
B	well a couple of seconds is everything isn't it?
A	and that was it
B	well I was standing right next to it
A	and I was I was strapped in the car I was like fuck
B	yeah
B	yeah it's all okay
A	may yeah maybe that was just a lesson you know
B	mm
A	lesson we needed
B	yeah I haven't seen it since
A	but someone said it was they're just testing it it's not actually open
B	oh really? I thought it was due to be open October the first
A	I yeah it was but I don't I don't know what
A	that means in China whether it's
B	quite a lot of lights over there it looks like a giant Christmas tree
A	no I don't know what their electricity bill will be like and that goes all night
B	they've turned off those big erm signs though those big round signs
A	yeah
B	haven't seen them for a while
A	no
B	oh she's such a good girl
A	yeah
B	almost two hours before
A	yeah but again you know I I think maybe that dinner
B	you're not sure about the dinner are you?
A	I'm not sure about it cos she cries a hell of a lot
B	she cries before but she she spoons it into her
A	but she didn't cry tonight when she didn't have it
B	but she had a lot of banana today
A	yeah
B	do you think it's just kind of like another activity that er that she does at home like a bit of a?
A	dunno well the most important thing is that she's getting the nutrition that she needs
B	mm well we'll see tonight
A	erm
B	whether she wakes up
A	what time she wakes up mm
B	yeah if she wakes up earlier because also she usually has a bottle
A	mm
B	like of the formula milk during the day some time and she didn't have that and that's quite filling
A	yeah she didn't have a well she did have a nap didn't she?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she had a nap nap when I went to the coffee shop too didn't she?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	only
B	how much was
A	no when she
B	oh okay
A	what? so probably about ten minutes?
B	okay that's hard though isn't it? to see that
A	mm
B	huh
A	going
B	really?
A	and just kinda walked off and then I heard them going oh
B	oh
A	they were just taking the piss though
B	they always say that if you erm
B	if you miss something that they say
A	yeah
A	yeah but I I watched a er BBC Iplayer they had The Proxy on last night watching some BBC stuff I watched er what's his name? that comic er oh shit what's his name? tut
B	well who do we usually watch?
A	he's really funny
B	I watched Eddie Izzard today
A	did you?
A	this guy he's kinda got a ginger he's got a ginger beard but he
B	ginger
A	a Scottish guy
B	erm
A	he's on Mock the Week I've forgotten his name
B	I can't think
A	oh bollocks but he had a programme about a er about the referendum on the BBC and it was it was really funny
B	mm?
A	and er he had a job welcoming people into this place
B	mm
A	which I
B	mm?
A	it's kind of a weird job isn't it?
B	but how can? what do you mean welcome?
A	you know saying
B	really?
A	yeah but that was his job and then when they left he says er
B	maybe a hotel?
B	er I don't know
A	it's kind of similar isn't it? but he was saying how he how he used to say this what is it?
B	yeah
B	welcome welcome
A	yeah and he was saying that to everyone and
B	what's this on? BBC Iplayer?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	so one one time people came in and he said
A	you know like taking taking the piss out of his shit accent
A	and then he his whole comedy was based on how you couldn't kind of reverse that situation like back home you know if you go into a Chinese restaurant and said
A	I'd like er can I have a sweet and sour rice? and saying sweet and sour rice
B	didn't your dad do this comedy one
A	I
B	for taking the piss yeah
A	for being being racist but
B	yeah
A	you know here you just have to kinda laugh at it and
B	well it's funny I think it's fine
A	we'll have to get well
B	but they do er er the most people do they're they're very
A	especially when there's so many different dialects and accents
B	yeah
A	that you know er if we're if we learnt the accent perfectly well here went up to Beijing and said it they'd still take the piss
B	yeah
A	just cos it sounds like we're farmers
B	yeah
A	anyway
A	yeah I haven't heard back from
B	hang on I'll be back in a minute
B	there's no word from from the landlady
A	did you text her?
B	no
A	er just send her a message saying it's okay we're in the house
B	oh yeah?
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah cos otherwise
B	well I doubt it otherwise she'd have phoned
A	because of who she is er
B	I'll I'll do use
A	she's never given a shit about anything else but
B	oh god
B	so she would've translated that
B	and be like
A	we've eat
B	we ate home
A	we've eaten our house
A	we couldn't get in so we've eaten it
B	hi hi we are home no at home? in home? what would translate better?
A	er in home
B	in home stick some really bad English in your in home erm
A	we are okay
B	but
B	job's a
B	English that you use every day
B	now we are in home
B	we are at home we
B	are fine okay shall I just put that?
A	yeah that'll do
B	okay oh
A	no no but it was
B	it felt like a long time
A	yeah it did and and I took out a lot of that junk you know?
B	yeah I know I couldn't believe you were carrying those
B	those sideboards and carrying
B	er yeah
A	and
B	you've gotta be careful with that because of all those nails sticking out as well
A	yeah
B	just
A	well I took out some earlier as well
B	cos sometimes she's well no she's a lot sturdier now she doesn't do that push back thing anymore does she?
A	no
B	she doesn't try and get away like
A	no
B	she doesn't flick back she went through a
A	so I I've been taking like a bit of that those wardrobes
B	yeah
A	out every time
A	and it's getting less and less
B	mm
A	and they keep disappearing from outside the apartment so someone's taking them away
A	so I'm just gonna keep doing it until it's all gone
B	yeah but you can't take the whole
A	er I'll I'll just get a hammer to it and break it up
B	so do you think we should go and knock on the neighbours' doors?
A	not now
B	and try and no but what about their post? you said
A	well I dunno
B	yeah I know
A	which is quite complicated
B	but they're gonna find out what happened and then they're gonna wonder like why we didn't come go round and tell them you know?
A	yeah
B	but like you said what if they have got an important letter in there? you'd be pissed off wouldn't you? would you be pissed off?
A	dunno it's pretty safe here
B	well what if if somebody did that to your letterbox what would you feel?
A	I'd feel pissed off
B	yeah would you feel better if they went and told you?
A	I dunno
B	I mean
A	I don't know if she's
B	they didn't
A	it might be worthwhile having a quick look at it actually cos I don't know if she's completely broken it or whether er if they put their key in it they can just latch it back in I don't know if the actual lock has just bent
B	right
A	so if it has bent then we should just go and bend it back
B	okay
A	and then they'll be able to
B	well maybe one of us
A	just put the key in otherwise they're gonna go down and see that it was just bent out of shape and then they'd be pissed off
B	yeah because
A	but if we
B	I would be
A	but if we bent it back first then so it's probably worth having a good look first
B	yeah one of us should go down and have a look
A	mm
B	because you know that would that that kind of thing can ruin your relationship with a neighbour
A	mm
B	and like he's a nice guy downstairs
A	yeah they are nice
B	I mean we don't we don't know the other ones but I know that they've just moved in erm
A	mm
B	mm and erm
A	yeah
B	oh they rallied round didn't they?
A	yeah they did yeah they were great well er should never've happened in the first place but they were great
B	yeah but then we we we we need to get a couple of keys done I mean I know the nanny has one but she left
A	mm
B	should've got the key back really to
A	mm
B	just to keep a spare one in
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean actually you know the best house to keep that round?
A	yeah
B	they'll be there like a lot more than anybody else with the baby won't they? like
A	yeah that's true
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and then if they've got their key round somebody else's house then there's always like a back channel of getting keys
A	mm
B	like if they're away then we can go to
A	yeah we should do that between us actually
B	make a trio
A	make a
B	a triangle
A	yeah make a
B	mind you we've got
A	mm
A	mm
B	he completely forgot I think
B	when he'd got locked out again
A	well I don't think the problem was I don't think the problem was his key he just got so blind drunk
B	he didn't know where he was
A	and he lost his glasses and he didn't know where he was
B	he doesn't always wear his glasses
A	well he hasn't recently because he lost them but like
A	so why does she need him to come and get her?
B	where where was he?
A	dunno in a ditch somewhere
B	that's the second time
A	yeah
B	and he's been but if you're lost how can you explain where you are?
A	oh I dunno well he was in
B	weird weren't it? it's that draught beer
A	maybe but
B	I dunno
A	there is something weird about the beer here
B	there's something weird
A	I mean I've I've never lost my memory before coming here when I'm drunk
B	I have you remember that New Year's Eve?
A	oh
B	I did hit my head really hard
A	er yeah well that was just silly we drunk a bottle of Absinthe between us
B	huh? oh

B	in
A	two thousand and two
B	two thousand and
A	two thousand and three
B	two thousand
A	somewhere around there
B	it was a New Year's Eve so two thousand and two to
A	yeah
B	no two thousand
A	oh my god that was awful
B	I woke up
B	and I had
A	god we both passed out in that club literally
B	no ah hang on I think you're thinking of a different night
A	no it was New Year in erm
B	yeah that oh that was in
A	yeah that was in
B	that one
A	yeah
B	I'm not thinking of that one
A	oh god
B	and I was standing on the kitchen sink
B	and
A	how I've
B	how I'd got in
A	yeah
B	how how on earth I managed to break in the
B	but
A	yeah it was one of those little tiny windows at the top of
B	tiny window
A	top of the window you know one of those ones that comes up
B	yeah but I'd broken in and
A	so you must've
B	into the big window
A	gone in head first
B	no I don't don't think I went through that
B	that was before we didn't have double glazing that's why if we'd have had double glazing those special locks then there was
B	how?
B	oh and I and I woke up in my high heels in the kitchen sink standing in the kitchen sink
B	and then I
B	how? no and I'd hit my head really bad that night and I think
A	yeah?
B	yeah I
A	I don't remember you
B	I know that I fell over in the club
A	yeah?
B	and I remember hitting my head
A	that's when we went to the gay bar didn't we?
B	yeah it was a good night apart from
A	yeah well I'm er I'm a little bit hazy about that
B	yeah no I was really out I was really
A	oh I think eleven o'clock we were finished
A	yeah everyone
B	to midnight
A	everyone else
B	I don't think that was real Absinthe was it? that was like
A	it was
B	well it was but
A	it was strong stuff
B	it was cheap one
A	but you don't
B	it wasn't er
A	god I'd never drink that now
B	no yeah
A	it's just
B	yeah no er I don't like that kind of thing anymore
A	I mean yeah it's kind of was it aniseedy? I can't even remember how it tasted
B	yeah
A	but yeah we drink Pernod if you want that kind of taste you don't need to drink something that strong
B	no well those were the days of we wanna get pissed
A	yeah
B	but it kind of ruined our night cos we didn't make it
A	yeah
B	and that was when we started saying well we'll stay in until
A	mm
B	midnight and then go out after
A	mm
B	did we?
B	in
A	yeah that was fun
B	and we stayed in and we we were I dunno singing songs
A	yeah with
B	yeah and then at er at midnight we all went maybe we do wanna go out
B	and then when we went out we got in all the bars
A	yeah for free
B	we didn't have to pay
B	cos they they were all charging weren't they?
A	yeah
B	before midnight
A	yeah that was good
B	after midnight they didn't didn't charge it was great yeah really enjoyed that New Year's
A	yeah it was nice yeah
B	yeah it was nice cos it was it was kind of spontaneous
A	well cos we were doing our Masters as well and we we had no money
B	mm mm
A	and so that was a big thing not having to pay
B	yeah
A	we were skint
B	yeah
A	like we were in debt then weren't we?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	that was a tough year that was
B	yeah who was saying? oh
A	yeah
B	and I said to him oh I would've never even considered paying before but if you say that it's good
A	mm
B	cos did you hear his Chinese tonight was very good?
A	well yeah er he's been studying full time for a year and a half
B	mm erm but I would've never considered paying money for like an internet course before but he reckons it's pretty good it's like
A	mm
B	so I thought that might be quite good for me
A	it's listening files? can't you just copy it off someone else?
B	well that's yeah well I
A	mm
B	which is a problem actually walking to work cos you can't mm
A	yeah yeah if you can't download it then
B	no
A	you don't get much chance here listening to stuff
A	yeah
B	so I doubt if they'd do that
A	no no that'd be silly wouldn't it
B	at least I got my video on Facebook with that copyright
A	yeah
B	I don't consider that a copyright issue
A	well no it's not these copyright laws are so archaic we need to redo it cos it's you know we're in the digital fucking world now people are gonna share stuff share songs you know put songs to your videos and you you can't
B	I see that as publicising
A	yeah it is
B	because they can't copy that song it's not like they can
A	no
B	listen to it on their own
A	no
B	they have to watch the video
A	no and they're like oh
B	yeah yeah
A	let me okay now I know what it is I'll download it for free
B	well yeah
B	but like with er like on the video
A	you can't stop it
B	that I made with the pictures that's publicising that's not copyright
A	mm
B	I don't think
A	mm yeah I I think copyright law needs to be readdressed
B	mm
A	it's just
B	I was so upset when that happened but
A	mm
B	I'm really glad that
A	well I think you know like I said I think I think Facebook must have a team of people in the US
B	yeah
A	going through just er
B	huh
A	just a random kind of check
B	must've been random must be random
A	of videos getting posted of a certain length and just seeing if it's got music or copyrighted material
B	that's weird cos it's not the length of one song it's the length of two songs
A	and you just happened to have one that was checked by someone
B	yeah
A	so when you redid it it would've been outside of the US working hours
B	yeah
A	and it was fine so
B	what a job to watch people's private videos
A	yeah but I suppose Facebook are
B	yeah
A	er I dunno movie companies
B	what about Youtube then?
A	well Youtube yeah erm well they are they
B	mm
A	but it's a needle in a haystack how can you stop it? for the million er millions of people that post some something how can you actually check it? because you can't you can't set up a computer program to check that kind of thing it has to be done with a
B	mm can't they can't a computer program check the wavelengths of like what's contained within video?
A	what?
B	like the songs
A	what? to recognise the wavelength of a particular song?
B	yeah it would be like recognising a fingerprint
A	not not at the moment
B	you have a huge database of er of
A	well in theory yeah but
B	like a fingerprint database
A	what? every? if you think of every song that's ever been produced you'd have to set up a whole
B	well yeah but once you've got a fast enough computer that should be easy enough shouldn't it? if people want your
A	well er
B	want their work copyrighted specially then they'd just plonk it into the
A	yeah but er
B	they submit the song that they want
A	yeah in the future I think that would be hopefully conceivable
B	the computer records the wavelength
A	but is it worth paying all that money to set up that kind of system? which is a huge project
B	well
A	it's massive right?
B	probably better than paying a thousand people to
A	yeah but
B	randomly check
A	what I was saying about the copyright law it's surely gotta change? so it's kind of a
B	mm yeah
A	cos I mean I know they're they're pushing it in like the UK and the US this copyright stuff but look at the rest of the world they've got no copyright laws at all
B	no
A	everyone just downloads anything they want
B	mm
A	they they put the fear on you in in Europe
B	mm
A	cos they they can kinda track your IP address and
B	mm
A	but the rest of the world don't give a shit about that what what does the Chinese government care about you're not paying some British record company their dues?
B	mm
A	they've got no fucking concern
B	mm
B	yeah
A	I dunno I haven't heard back from
B	oh god I forgot food huh we could've had the baked potatoes in all this time
A	tut oh
B	it'd be ready now
B	we forgot
A	well I'll stop this and then I'll give
B	okay
A	bye
