A	I'm just gonna turn it on so that
unknown_female	okay yeah
unknown_female	we can just carry on talking about stuff
C	but I think I think they've got an alright flavour I had some today in my coffee
A	right let's try that
B	I think they're a bit dry
C	Google
B	Google
C	Google
C	I don't think there's an M in it
D	huff
A	Google
B	oh huff
C	see there's no M
A	no I dunno what it is
B	it's a
A	oh Google
D	every every home should have one
A	I thought that was in er have you got two copies of this?
A	oh right yeah yeah yeah
B	well we were just looking at it and then
B	yeah
C	looking at the new products bits and the erm
C	recipes
B	but erm it's got cranberries chocolate chips orange and then you soak the cranberries in Grand
C	Grand Marnier
A	oh I don't know where to buy that
B	is that is that a brandy?
A	no I think it's erm
unknown_female	oh
C	liqueur
A	isn't it
B	oh it's orange liqueur
C	it's not Cointreau
A	I was looking for oh yeah oh maybe it isn't
C	Cointreau I mean I've got I had a feeling it was some kind of sweeter than brandy liqueur maybe with orange but not as orangey as Cointreau
unknown_female	mm
D	that's a bit weird isn't it?
A	yeah
B	maybe we should look at what Grand
A	I'm a bit confused then
B	Marnier is
A	cos I was looking for orange liqueur in
D	yeah
A	in Lidl or Co-op
A	have they got it?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	it's weird that they've got a better choice of the traditional type stuff like that
A	yeah
C	in a little garage than
A	yeah
C	in a supermarket or something
B	I don't know whether erm there's a very small off-licence on
A	mm
B	that I almost went in to look for port
A	yeah no er yeah
unknown_female	I ran out of time and patience for going round looking for various things
C	I know it gets frustrating
A	I had one mission to find witch hazel which took a lot of shops and then afterwards like that's enough missions
B	oh
D	where did you find it?
B	I'd've gone to Lloyds
A	Lloyds Pharmacy
A	but that wasn't the first place I thought of going at all I went to Savers
unknown_female	Superdrug
unknown_female	Superdrug and then
B	yeah actually Superdrug's where we normally get it from
A	they didn't have any
B	they've probably cos they've put all their Christmas stuff out
A	mm
B	you see how many shelves of things they have? all those gift boxes and everything you think well what what did they have on their shelves before this?
B	more stuff that you can't buy now
A	mm mm
B	and one year they'd moved all their contact lens stuff and there was they'd reduced the whole range down to just a few and they didn't have the ones I needed and I said to the assistant well
unknown_female	but I still wear my contact lenses even though it's Christmas
A	mm
B	so erm
B	yeah so I don't know I need to look up what Grand Marnier is but
B	orange
A	mm
B	an orange liqueur with
B	it's got a zest of an orange and orange juice in it as well so
A	mm yeah maybe
B	I thought I could do it in that round tin although our tin doesn't have that
A	oh yeah
B	kind of the shapes but
A	oh well
B	hopefully it would still work so that's what we're gonna have
C	scrape that with your finger
B	and hopefully your mum likes cranberries
C	I think she'll eat them
B	she yeah I think she'll eat them
B	chocolate chip
C	I like a bit of chocolate chip
B	so that's what we're gonna make
A	cool
A	what are we gonna have for food? we haven't decided yet
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	oh we want
A	erm well they have done in the past they've had like postgrads and staff
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	I only even know that the staff went out by themselves because I saw like somebody's Facebook picture
B	oh right
A	so we've been snubbed basically
B	and erm when you're self-employed there is no Christmas dinner
A	no although I did notice that
unknown_female	mm
A	and
B	oh wild pickings
A	wild pickings? they were organising like a self-employed people's Christmas do
B	oh that's a nice idea
unknown_female	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	that was down in
B	oh she they're the people that run
A	yeah they've opened a shop together yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos I was gonna go to
C	you've gotta pop in
B	there was a health and well-being fair over that weekend
A	oh right
B	and they had like free taster sessions of
A	oh right cool
B	reflexology and that and I thought I could go for the day
A	yeah
B	go to that new shop cos it was
A	yeah
B	and the clothes look really interesting
A	yeah
A	er I used to do erm the sewing classes with her and stuff like yeah so it was really good
A	yeah
B	that's a nice idea to have er a self-employed people's
A	yeah
B	get together
A	yeah
B	I went to the work one
D	well it seems a bit odd cos there'll be loads of people you don't know and like
A	well they might know each other if it's just for people round that
D	it's quite a tenuous connection somehow
B	yeah I suppose if you
A	no I think they did know each other some like a load of people that were thinking of going
D	or something
A	but but she was sending it out on her newsletter
B	mm
A	like so it would've been quite a nice thing really
B	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	but yeah
B	I was probably gonna do a nut roast for
A	oh right
B	normally like somebody's posh recipe that I find but this year I thought I'm not gonna do pastry so I'm just going to where did I find the recipe? oh it was er online it's smoked tofu pine nuts
C	but it uses a ready made
B	and it uses a packet of ready made nut roast
C	nut roast
B	add stuff to theirs use theirs as a base and add er add loads of extra stuff
C	was the recipe by the people that made that nut roast?
B	erm it's by people who
B	blog about them I think yeah
A	oh right
C	here's a present for you you can wear it as a badge
B	thank you
B	and erm
A	cos we had that recipe that we've made a couple of times like the one that we had in Ireland with my sister that was really nice it's quite posh like
unknown_female	it's a step up from a normal nut roast
B	yeah
A	cos it's got tofu in it and it's supposed to have pine nuts but we didn't put them in cos it's expensive but
B	well maybe it's the same recipe then
A	but it didn't involved a ready-made nut roast
B	oh okay
C	well they're all pretty similar aren't they? nut roasts
B	this had got cranberries in but I really like a nut roast
A	yeah I do
A	oh right
unknown_female	and then I can just take one
A	mm
B	like to Christmas dinner at your mum's
B	fake
unknown_female	yeah
B	I don't
C	oh can I have a bacon butty? and you say
C	a vegan bacon butty well obviously
B	er yeah so you'll be having that on Christmas Day and Boxing Day then
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	that'll be nice
A	in one massive like
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	we had all sorts of things and like and
C	what? in one pan?
A	no but the plate
A	ah
unknown_female	mm
B	gotta have sprouts
A	yeah I'm not usually that keen but now we've found a way to cook them
C	what? coated in peanut butter?
A	well it's better if you cook them
A	well
unknown_female	well it's better if you cook them in lemon but then if
B	ah
A	if you'd rather cook if you fry them in lemon and garlic then that's even better
B	oh right
C	that's almost like frying cabbage then
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	mm
C	cos I really love fried cabbage and often with ginger and garlic
A	mm
C	and stuff so it's probably a bit like that
D	they basically are mini cabbages
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
B	the treehouse ones you like the ones in the treehouse cos they're still on the stick aren't they?
A	oh on the stork yeah
C	yeah and you can do morris dancing with them
A	there seems to be like a trend now like cos they're even selling them in Lidl like that you can buy a stick like
C	oh that reminds me like of the stick with my mum bought this for
A	oh right
C	I was thinking we could keep it here anyway
B	no I just
C	as a as er a replacement for a tambourine
unknown_female	cos you can
B	it just looks like a baby's rattle
unknown_female	but
unknown_female	I was gonna say it sounds like jingle bells doesn't it?
unknown_female	or sleigh bells
C	oh I
C	hello dolly
unknown_female	ah
B	so yeah I'm not that fussed about using that
B	it's just a bit erm
unknown_female	mm
D	no there's no drum element
C	no
unknown_female	mm
B	it's just a bit high-pitched
A	yeah
A	well the bells make quite a different sound to the little mini cymbally things don't they?
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
C	well they're not as good as a tambourine but
C	if you didn't have a tambourine right it's something that you can
A	yeah
C	pat against your thigh and
unknown_female	you can do that as well the wrist rotation a nice little move
A	yeah we were ought to get a triangle I think for just like
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	ding
C	yeah that'd be good
unknown_female	oh meow
D	meow
C	yeah she'd prefer a triangle it's not as noisy
C	er I saw a game that you can get for the PC recently where you can it's like Rocksmith but for any instrument it picks up the note from the microphones you can use it for a recorder
A	oh right
C	trumpet erm all sorts of stuff
D	oh what's that called
C	ah can't remember the name of it it's when I was looking at
unknown_female	cos it turns out you can use the same cable that connects to the guitar to the Xbox to connect my guitar to my PC
B	oh right
C	so I can then play the same game it'll pick up what I'm doing on the the electric guitar
A	oh so you
C	and it'll give me the notes like in Rock Band
A	yeah cool
C	erm but I can do it on my PC to the
A	yeah
C	instead of always being stuck here with
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	the weight of it on my shoulder
C	erm I could then have it resting on my knee
B	did you notice your shoulder was aching again?
C	yeah I've had a bit of back stuff
unknown_female	and it's the same shoulder I have the guitar on so I didn't know if it was related or
A	mm yeah
C	if it's it could just as easily be my posture on the chair
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	like especially if
A	mm
C	cos I do different things with the left and the right hand
B	yeah
C	obviously
B	do you always move your mouse? er change
C	no I leave it still and control the game with the power of my thoughts
B	no do you move the mouse from side to
C	er I did use er I moved it to the left today but that's a rarity at home I normally use my right hand for the mouse
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	unless it starts aching and then I switch it to the left
B	but that's your left shoulder that you were saying you've got pain in
C	yes
B	mm
A	mm
B	so it's not so much
C	but it could still be posture
unknown_female	I notice when I'm playing on my computer sometimes I feel an ache in there
B	mm
C	so
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	but anyway it means that I'd be able to practise guitar stuff
C	yeah er but it's only
unknown_female	er er I got
A	mm
C	I thought oh go on then
A	can you use the mouse with both hands then? do you use?
B	yeah in work I have it on my left
unknown_female	and at home I have it on the right
A	oh wow
D	same here
B	and it's just a normal mouse in work I just moved it to the other side
A	yeah
B	cos you can get left-handed mice
A	yeah
B	erm
C	well or you just reverse the buttons
A	just so
B	yeah other people have said when they've said to me oh they get
A	yeah I'm not that ambidextrous I expect I could if I practised I suppose
B	yeah
A	it's just that initial frustration of being slow and stuff
C	yeah if it's just general Windows use you generally er you move around a bit
C	that's it you're using keyboard a lot
A	yeah
C	cos you either typing or
B	yeah
C	the scroll wheel
A	yeah scroll wheel
C	and you can use page
unknown_female	mm
C	so you
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	loads of things I could do with keyboard and just tab and shift tab and
A	yeah I'm not that good at erm shortcuts
C	erm
B	I don't use many either
C	no but it became second nature
B	yeah
C	so even in Outlook I can switch between my contacts and my calendar and all that
B	oh right
C	I don't normally use the mouse for that
B	mm
C	erm the icons from Windows XPL? Windows seven and like for the icons of whatever you've pinned to the taskbar they all get the number one two three four five if it's invisible you don't know but if you press the Windows key and two it will activate the second thing you've pinned
unknown_female	so you know I don't use a mouse for clicking on the programs I want it's just like Windows two that's Outlook Windows three Notepad
C	erm so that saves a lot of mouse work especially if the mouse is up there
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and you're sort of having to move it back and forth
unknown_female	mm
C	to click on programs you don't have to bother with them
A	did I tell you about when TalkTalk like erm I nearly got scammed?
unknown_female	the other day
B	what? on the phone? or?
A	yeah there was at home like still
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and so it's like the dreaded daytime phone calls I thought ah I'd better answer it
C	ah that pisses me off
A	but it was TalkTalk or so they said and it was like from a call centre in India which you thought well yeah that figures
C	so are you with TalkTalk
A	yeah yeah so they were like oh yeah some erm you're getting loads of rubbish like downloaded to all these things are
B	mm
A	you haven't given me any ID or anything like this so they were like oh yes erm well your address is this and you're this person aren't you? and erm this is your TalkTalk account number blah blah blah they knew all of that so
unknown_female	so then I thought oh well carry on talking to you and see what you want at least erm and then they were like oh well put your computer on so I was like yeah okay it's turning on and they were like is it on yet?
unknown_female	if you really want to do this
B	mm
A	and then like erm
C	they wanted you to download something or click on a link?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	they
B	mm
A	what's I kept asking what is this gonna do to my computer when I've done it?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and they wouldn't tell me
A	so I was like okay I've gotta go erm but
B	yeah
A	and it is a scam like totally they they er remote control your computer then
C	yeah
A	erm
B	oh my god that's really bad they managed to hack into TalkTalk's accounts then or something
A	well er TalkTalk haven't responded properly
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	they just say they're investigating
unknown_female	but it sounds like probably they don't pay their workers in India very much
unknown_female	so they got
B	oh
A	to farm the data out to somebody else I expect
C	mm
B	somebody just siphoned it off
A	probably
B	for a payment
A	I reckon that's what happened
B	mm
A	oh right
B	my mum gets that a lot she gets phoned up by Microsoft
unknown_female	yeah
A	as if Microsoft would phone you up
C	exactly
A	like if you ever gave Microsoft your phone number anyway
B	I know
unknown_female	so
C	I normally spend ages talking to em I'll ask em things like
unknown_female	well what have you done about the bug fix for you know this
C	Windows I think this is more a critical error than
unknown_female	than that one or I'll I'll say I'll like I'll make up technobabble myself and
C	and say well hold on but surely I thought that that weakness in the structure was fixed if you ran MSCDXE but with a slash H config file because I do that every day surely they are
C	but it's
B	it's normally a dead giveaway
unknown_female	yeah yeah
unknown_female	if they ask for
A	oh right yeah
B	cos somehow on some database somebody registered this house or this number as
A	yeah
B	so they if they ask for
unknown_female	or it's just some giant junk mail
C	I think that it's just it's come from you and cos it's a man answering they ask is that
B	no it's not come from me I
C	cos I'm not I'm obviously not
C	so they just say is that Mr cos the only name they've got is yours cos you're the one
B	yeah but they ask for
C	no no they don't ask for they they just say is that
B	they don't know they they know they never ask for
D	do they only ask you for
B	I can't remember now I'm confused
B	yeah
C	I'm pretty sure cos it er it's only that's all they've got the
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	just er cos that's what you you were registered publicly weren't you?
B	I'm in the phonebook yeah
C	yeah that's what I mean
A	are you?
C	so they've got the name and the the phone number and everything
B	yeah
A	that's brave
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	it doesn't seem to make any difference now actually
B	I don't think that makes any difference I do it because if people want to contact me for my yoga teaching
A	oh right yeah
C	but they can get that off the website
unknown_female	yeah
C	well we've gotta keep them out
B	so erm
D	who doesn't have access to the internet these days?
B	a lot of people
A	it's true like well old people don't want access to the internet
B	twenty percent
unknown_female	it's all too confusing
unknown_female	no but
A	no but they don't want to they don't understand it
B	or what if you want to ring up er what if you want to find out tonight if there's yoga on tomorrow?
A	yeah
B	you can't go to the library
A	you'll not go to the library for that
D	true true enough
B	erm
B	that's about three percent of the population
C	but my mum's got a phone but she doesn't use the internet on it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	it's just a normal phone I dunno if it even has any kind of internet thing
B	in fact it's probably even less now the population that don't have access to a phone used to be only like a few percent but
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos there's now like a campaign to get like cos you know you have to pay for the landline rental and everything
B	mm
B	yeah
A	they're like why are we paying for this?
unknown_female	and not and actually go oh well that is where the internet's coming from
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	like into the house like but yeah
B	oh dear not happy with the conversation
A	meow meow
C	you
B	did you want a to start playing Rock Band?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	do you
B	hot drink first
C	I have officially got nothing else to say
A	that's it the conversation
B	so what's their social research?
