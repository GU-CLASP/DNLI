C	no they don't
B	then the wishbone joint went we was driving along and the bloody thing jumped down the bonnet came up we couldn't see the whole bloody wheel had gone right flat underneath the car
A	that's quite a bad breakdown
C	it used to do it all the time
A	really?
C	yeah
C	yeah both the Herald and the Vitesse had the same problem the wheels would either go like that
C	or if you were going round a corner one wheel would go like that
D	that's what happened to us
A	that's bad
C	and there was one the Vitesse one of them at gate duty at school thought this Vitesse came up the the
A	oh

C	oh here we go
A	it's er in the blue pot it's
C	one spoon of that
A	er one spoon of that and it's called half-spoon
C	so half the spoon of the one spoon?
E	don't confuse the issue
A	well don't stop it
C	one of one of the half the half the sugar of the one
C	just put half spoon
C	in the cup
C	but a full spoon
A	half a cup
C	half half of half a cup
A	half a cup of one spoon
C	half of one half of one cup and the spoon of the other
A	he's just confused you
D	no
C	yeah three of them that'll do it
D	one
A	rumble crumble oh thank you very much nanny that looks lovely

C	no thank you
E	crumble
A	I got the skin
A	on the custard
C	I think I've suffered enough
E	you've done very well
A	crimble crumble
C	crimble crumble nice piece of squirrel
C	yeah
A	Friday Night Dinner and that's filmed really close to us
C	yep
A	yep
E	I was told I had to eat this
A	that's for you that is
E	or suffer
C	it isn't
E	the consequences
A	indeed
E	I think that should not happen anymore
C	grey day
E	yeah
A	grey day
C	the best way round to have it
A	not a cold pudding on a hot day?
C	or grey pudding on a hot day
C	I'm now a wood pigeon
C	I go from peasant to pheasant to peasant to partridge to wood pigeon
A	mm
C	mm that's not a pheasant that's a partridge
C	and one has never actually been observed in a pear tree
C	it's a common urban fallacy
C	no they're not
C	completely different
A	they look really similar
C	no they don't they don't look anything like each other
A	yes they do
C	no they don't
A	they do if it's the right thing I'm thinking of
C	tell erm I can tell a moorhen and a coot a mile off
A	moorhen or coot?
C	moorhen or coot? moorhen or coot?
A	the only difference is they've got the white things on their face
C	yes
A	but don't that look like a moorhen?
C	no
A	isn't it really similar apart?
C	it's got a similar shape
A	it's completely identical apart from the colouring on its face
D	they have the same colour feathers
B	moorhens have red beaks don't they?
D	yeah
A	they're the same shape they've got the same big feet they've just got different colouring on their non-feathered bits
D	yeah and they all like water
C	and moorhens are intelligent whereas coots are stupid
A	oh really?
C	yes
A	well say that to this coot's face
A	moorhen
B	yeah that's what I mean
C	completely different bird
A	if it's in the distance in a in a pond though and you're like hey look a moorhen
C	well if it's sufficiently far away you'd have difficulty telling a different car in a pond
A	a different car in a pond?
C	yes
C	is it a Cortina or an Escort? I dunno I can only see its roof
A	shows the kind of area you grew up in
C	yeah
A	let's go feed the cars
D	take a photo while you're in there
C	that's why
C	yeah
A	you can walk across them now
C	I wonder if
D	no
E	mm
A	seems like a mad thing to do doesn't it? you'd be really cold
A	a little concrete puddle
B	mm?
A	is this a low sugar crumble?
B	no
C	there was a pond at the mill I suppose
A	mm are you looking at
A	ponds of
C	yes there was a
A	a mill pond not a village pond?
C	yes
A	now we're going to get pedantic about that
C	a mill pond is in fact in plenum
A	in where?
C	in where?
C	a mill pond it's a kind of plenum
A	it's a kind of plenum? what's plenum?
C	plenum it's like a buffer
A	a buffer?
C	yes
A	oh thank you grandad
C	instead of running a mill directly from the river
A	mm
C	you keep some water in a pond so you'd have a constant flow through the mill that the water tops up so that the
A	I see
C	and you'd have a constant
A	and that's what a plenum is?
C	yes it's a reserve of something a plenum chamber in a fuel injected car for example or a turbo charged car keeps a reservoir of pressurised air to reduce lag on the turbo
A	mm
C	and it's called the plenum chamber
A	cool I did not know that
C	like you could care even less
B	there you are you should learn something new every day
A	I do care but now I know what a plenum is
B	mm
C	it's well well a plenum chamber is it might be named after something I don't know
A	is it spelled like Blenheim? or is it spelt completely differently?
C	erm I don't know I don't think I've never seen it written down
E	thank you
D	gotta get up this
C	plenum
A	oh oops sorry
D	sorry
A	sorry grandad
A	oh thank you very much
B	want any more?
E	sorry?
D	do you want any more?
B	do you want more?
A	I am stuffed thank you
E	no I'm fine thank you
A	very full of crumble thank you very much nan
B	alright you're welcome
D	now
A	a nice cup of tea
E	cup of tea
A	a nice strong cup of tea
E	tea I'll get a cookie as well
A	look
A	plenum P L N
C	how many have you got?
A	P L E N U M
E	there's three in there
C	I'll have one then as long as I'm not depriving anyone of them
E	you're not depriving anyone
A	pressured housing containing a gas or fluid
C	uhu
A	that's positive pressure
C	yeah
A	pressure higher than the surroundings
C	yeah
A	one function of the plenum is
C	so the mill pond is higher than the mill and therefore has a higher pressure than the water at the mill
A	that makes sense
C	science
A	mm
C	daily science updates
A	daily science updates
B	yeah you learn a lot when you live in the country
B	all around us when you live in a town you all sorts of wildlife and
A	mm
B	things growing and yeah
A	it's nice to live in the countryside
B	yeah
D	cor bloody hell that's London that ain't nothing's
A	it's like
D	good in London
A	it's like living at the edge of a very big overcrowded city
A	as well as like but no we do live in a nice area
B	you do
A	a nice quiet
B	you live in a nice area and you've got a park haven't you?
A	yeah we've got a park there's lots of parks in London
D	where you put your car
B	yeah
A	we've got a car
D	you er park where you park
A	and we've got a yeah and we've got a drive we've got a drive which is not that common to
B	in London mm
A	yeah like a rented shared house and have somewhere to park your car
B	what about
A	it's a good combination
B	what about
A	they don't have a car
B	no oh well
A	no
B	you don't have to share a drive then
D	if they live in London they've got buses and trains
B	oh yeah I know but
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	who needs to be
B	but where does where does she
A	on the outside edge
B	where's her family live? where does she come from?
B	yeah
B	mm?
A	yeah yeah yeah I've known
B	yeah yeah I know yeah
A	erm her parents live in
B	mm
A	just the other side of
B	oh well
A	and they've got a really good Chinese restaurant there and
B	mm
D	they don't
C	the bestest one I've ever been to that
A	it's a surprisingly good Chinese restaurant in pretty much the middle of nowhere
C	I've been to lots of Chinese restaurants
A	and you like that one best?
C	all over the country and that one in
B	oh
D	so
A	where you've gotta go
B	mm
C	it's in one of these you know you know these like they were built in the sixties and seventies like these flat top
B	oh yeah?
C	you've just got this sort of flat top building with like the
D	yeah
C	it's in it's in one of those
B	yeah oh right
C	it doesn't look anything special but it's fantastic
B	mm
C	and it's cheap
A	yeah it's reasonable
C	but they used to do an all you can eat buffet on Thursdays
D	mm there's a lot do that
A	are they?
B	yeah cos of these erm antique programmes
A	antiques yeah of course yeah antiques
B	they're
B	they're always they're always on the telly aren't they?
B	you see her walking down the street in
B	for the antique shops
A	you know
D	you ain't seen the pub now you wouldn't recognise it
C	mm no I mean one of those antique programmes?
A	you you you know
B	mm?
B	yeah
D	oh yeah it was the other week yeah I've got the
C	mm
D	up at the
A	she works in an antiques place called
B	oh right
A	and they came in to make a TV programme so at some point she's going to turn up on one of these
B	so she's going to be oh wow
A	programmes going
B	yeah
A	talking about the stuff in the shop
B	mm
D	selling it to somebody
A	yeah
D	yeah we yeah we had
B	yeah
D	them up at the
B	oh we often watch
B	we we we watch the er different different antique programmes Bargain Hunt and erm British
A	yeah?
B	and she's always going in these shops
A	every other shop in
B	mm
D	yeah
A	so yeah
A	he does he particularly likes
B	yeah
A	stuff that's a bit junky
B	car boots?
A	yeah car boots are good
B	yeah
C	it's pretty much what a garage sale is or a yard sale
A	it is yeah
C	mm
B	oh they always come on these programmes and they say they'll have some fancy thing then they'll say cor that's nice where did you get it from? car boot how much you pay? three quid and now it's worth hundreds and I think I've never found anything at a car boot that's worth money it's a load of rubbish
B	is what I always see
A	I know it
B	yeah
B	no oh I have
A	certain toys and things
B	I've got rid of things
C	that's why I like Ebay
B	I've put things in erm not chucked them away but I've put things in the charity shop you know and then found out that that sort of thing has like erm what is it? that Carlton Ware that's worth a lot of money now and I thought I had ever such a pretty little pot there was a little dish shaped like a leaf and then a little dish shaped like a pear with a
A	yeah
B	leaf for a spoon and er really pretty
A	uhu
B	and I've had it sitting in a cupboard for years and then I thought oh I dunno I'm having a clear out and that went and then I see things on there and I thought oh my god I bet my little pot will be worth something now
C	yeah
B	and I took got rid of them
A	mm
B	just have a clear out every so often and think that's gotta go that's gotta go and then afterwards they turn round and say oh that's worth money
C	yeah I know
B	and what was it that game she had from?
C	oh she had so many
B	no that was a had a sort of Blockbuster thing and I thought that can go and I think I think afterwards no
C	that's where Ebay comes in
C	they're very good for stuff like that
B	mm
C	you just put it on there you say I want ninety-nine P for it and the price just goes up and up and up and up and up and up I had an old cassette deck just a cassette player you know from my
B	yeah I've seen it
A	my my big stack unit and I thought it's not worth much so I put it on Ebay for ninety-nine P got
C	result yeah
B	well they do the
A	yeah
B	I've them on the these old Bakelite radios from years ago they don't even work you know but they want them because they're from that era people use these things as what they call design pieces that they want a room what reflects the thirties or the forties and they buy these old things just to have as an ornament sitting there on a shelf
A	yeah
B	you know and you think my god we had one of them when I was little you know and think they're really old fashioned now but they still buy them
C	they sell valve radios you
B	yeah
C	mm
C	a restored one
B	and telephones really old telephones and
C	a restored valve radio is worth quite a lot of money
B	mm
B	can you?
C	yeah
B	I didn't know you could buy valves and stuff like that now
C	yeah you you you have to get them from Russia but
B	oh
C	you can still get the valves
B	you'd have valves in old tellies as well didn't you?
C	yeah but that did these that bears nothing to a traditional telly
B	no
C	that's that's nothing like er that's
B	oh no well if
C	it's a completely different bucket of
B	where I've I've seen
C	that is that is
B	I mean nothing but sort of
A	that's not an expression
B	transistor type thing you know all on a board and that
C	that is a computer
B	yeah
C	it's not a telly it's not strictly speaking a television none of them are now cos they're all digital
B	mm
C	and the easiest way to make a digital thing do something is to put a computer in it so you've got two boards in there one is a computer and the other one just controls the power that's it
B	yeah
C	which makes them very easy for me to repair but your traditional TV repair man just goes
A	mm
C	let's take that board out put a new board in
D	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah okay
A	needs a new board
C	yeah
B	yeah well I mean it's the same with anything though I mean when we first got married we had an old erm Hoover twin tub and he he'd be at work and I'd think oh god now what's gone wrong? and the blooming erm there
C	uhu
B	I'd have to get a screwdriver take the back off put it on this and I thought no the last time I called a chap in to do the washing machine he took the top off and like you say there's bloody boards on like what's in there you know and
C	uhu
B	oh that's gotta have a new circuit board oh cos that thermostat's gone or this has gone oh my god
C	bottle changers they're called them
B	er?
C	they're called bottle changers
B	mm
C	it's what
B	oh right
C	and you used to call them bottle changers didn't diagnose the problem just swapped out the valves until it started working which is what the majority of people do now they go oh well the fault's on this board so I'm gonna change the board not gonna find out which component has gone wrong on the board they just throw the whole board away a new board a new TV board for that is probably two hundred quid
B	but when I was little you know I mean we had no electric in our cottage when I was small not for years and we had this big old radio on the windowsill and you used to have an accumulator to run it off you know
C	uhu
B	and
C	uhu
B	just put it on the back and he'd have a little carrying on thing and we had a record player wind up one
A	a wind up record player?
B	yeah you used to wind it up put a record on and listen to it and then put another and it's and buy needles for it you know and I'm think honestly
A	did it used to go funny and slow if it was running out
B	no if you wound it full up that would last for one record but and when I first got my first little record player I think that was a Dansette and you could actually play
A	cool
B	yeah and put a couple of records on so they dropped down you know and thinking oh lovely
C	you know record players used to have four speeds didn't they?
B	sixteen?
C	yeah
B	I never had sixteen on mine
C	no most most of them did they had
B	yeah?
C	four speeds yeah and one was sixteen and I've never ever seen a record that plays sixteen RPM never seen one
D	they used to have to be
B	but do you know when they
B	yeah but when when when they went onto from records to erm tapes er we all got rid of our record players and got
A	some of your records
B	I do love them
D	yeah
B	because now
A	mm
B	they have a lot of people buy them and play them because they reckon that the sound of an old record is a lot better than you get off a tape or a CD
C	well
A	mm
C	those people erm I have a special term for them idiot
E	mm
B	yeah
A	they're nice to have it's it's more of a ritual putting on a
C	it is it's it's the whole ritual of it
A	it's it
C	and but people that say
A	it's a bit of magic isn't it?
C	you know you
A	it's
C	it sounds sounds more realistic or no no it doesn't no you've got scratches you've got rumbles you've got distortion it does not sound more realistic than a digital recording no it doesn't you may prefer the way it sounds
A	because of the nostalgia
C	but that's purely a subjective choice
C	but that is entirely up to you
E	mm
C	I won't criticise you for that but don't tell me it's better because it's not it is not more realistic absolutely not but people'll like valve amplifiers because they have a warmer sound yeah that warmer sound has a word it's called distortion
A	so the warmness of the fuzzy sound
C	yes
A	ah but there are erm
C	yeah
A	I think you can get things like gold tone and silver tone and
C	right
A	and that depends whether it's been run through gold or silver
C	yeah
A	coils or something? I don't know
C	yeah
A	but erm something
C	yeah
A	is that is that a real thing that it can sound silver or it can sound gold?
C	it's it's all snake oil
A	it's all snake oil
C	it's all snake oil
E	mm
C	you know
A	monster cables?
C	monster monster cables you can get a cable to run from your TV to your DVD player your HDMI cable you can go and buy one of those and you can get one in a pound shop for a pound or you can go to somewhere that sells monster cables and you can buy exactly the same cable for four hundred and fifty pounds
C	do you know what the difference between them is?
B	no
C	one costs four hundred and fifty pounds and the other one costs a pound there is no difference it's a digital signal so it either works or it doesn't there's no difference in quality in sound quality or picture quality
B	mm
C	whatsoever because it's digital it either works or it doesn't work there's no grey area in between there's no improvement in sound quality or picture quality or anything like that it works or it doesn't so if you pay a pound for it brilliant if you pay four hundred and fifty quid for it I'd like to meet you and you can become one of my customers and
C	and you know I'll I'll put a little knob on the front of your computer that'll go up to eleven so it goes faster than everyone else's computer and I'll charge you four thousand pounds for that it'll just be a little knob that's not connected to anything but you'll think it goes faster
B	mm
C	and I'll make four thousand pounds out of you thank you very much
A	thank you very much
B	but it's the same with anything isn't it? clothes anything or some people will pay thousands for something you can get at another shop for a tenner and have just as good
C	well the I mean that's
B	it's just all these
C	but it's a that's a subjective thing though isn't it? I mean you know you you might wanna pay more for something that has I dunno a a higher thread count you know a cotton with a higher thread count for example
B	mm
C	that is undoubtedly a better quality than something you'd get out of Primark or or or or Matalan or something like that and
B	mm
C	the
A	mm yeah I was wondering about the gold and silver tone thing because I thought it was to do with like electric guitars and stuff and it was to do with the electronics part of it but I know that you have silver band and brass band
C	mm it may may just be a term they use for different sound processes that er that it goes through
A	maybe
C	I mean they're in
A	I thought it was the actual precious metals though
C	no I mean gold gold is used in connectors
A	yeah
C	because gold has a very low electrical resistance and it doesn't tarnish so it's really good for high frequency stuff I'm not talking
A	yeah
C	your actual broadband signal is a high frequency signal that comes down that so the voice
A	yeah
C	in the nineteen sixties when they built it because it was cheaper easier to use lighter
A	oh
C	so they had to replace all the aluminium
C	with copper and and fibre
A	oh
A	they couldn't have foreseen that in the sixties
C	no you couldn't
B	but all different metals have certain properties don't they?
C	yes they do
B	I mean that's why they use copper in electric cable and all that type of thing isn't it?
C	yeah
B	and gold
C	it depends what you're using it for
B	I love gold never tarnishes
A	yeah
C	no that's why it's used in
B	yeah they dig gold up from thousands of years ago and it's still shiny
C	yeah
B	lovely
C	yeah there's very few things that gold reacts with
B	yeah
C	I think nitric acid is one
B	and silver
C	uhu
B	and like
C	yeah I think they've
A	wow
C	I know they were using gold for the treatment of arthritis
B	mm
C	dunno I dunno how that went but they were
B	no
C	they were using gold for that
A	is that like those bracelets or?
C	no
B	copper copper's
A	er literally injecting it?
C	yeah
A	wow
B	copper's good for arthritis you have copper bracelets and things
C	mm
B	but erm
A	is that debatable or er?
C	yeah
B	also they you can buy what is it? erm magnetic bracelets and things what are supposed to be good for
C	yeah yeah
B	I've I've never tried it
C	and
B	yeah
C	just hover above your head and it will realign your chi
B	yeah
A	the crystal thing is so
B	oh every every crystal is supposed to have a certain one is calming one is something else they all got different properties you know
C	well you can you if you get a box of crystals you can pick one up and you go yeah and that one's
A	the funny thing about crystals is how like alive they are with like the hippy scene which was always very you know planet conscious and about eating wholefoods and it's like and then you've got your crystal collection which you need because of vague erm spiritual reasons but they are terrible for the environment because the the way they mine them
C	uhu
A	and and and it's meaningless as well
C	yes
A	so it's like
C	I don't have a problem I mean crystals are beautiful and people have
A	they are beautiful yeah
C	collections of crystals in cabinets and they're they're very very pretty
A	yeah
C	but don't tell me they have mystical properties
A	I know and especially when the whole rest of the ethos of your life is about sustainable living and saving the planet but you
C	uhu
A	keep buying crystals
C	well
A	not the like biggest environmental
C	oh my
A	problem but
C	is that it's impossible to destroy a diamond
A	it's impossible to
C	it's great cos give me that give me that diamond here and give me a blowtorch and I will turn that diamond into carbon dioxide with this flame
A	yeah
C	you can't it's impossible to destroy a diamond well
A	shall we bet some money on it?
C	get get
A	bet a diamond
A	oh
C	where's my diamond gone? you're breathing on it it's now carbon dioxide
A	oh
C	because a diamond is just carbon it's pure carbon
B	they make diamonds now don't they?
C	yeah
A	you can be made into a diamond
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	yes they make diamonds now they
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah they're not as pretty as the ones that
A	are formed naturally
C	mined after being you know under extreme pressure
B	yeah
C	for billions of years
B	when it comes down to it really
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't pay
A	mm
C	a different element but yeah
A	yeah I suppose if it's aesthetically if you just wanted a bit of glitz
B	mm
A	could have some painted plastic
B	yeah
C	cubic zirconia
A	oh yeah I guess I like them cos they are fairly hardy as long as you don't take a blowtorch to my engagement ring it should be fine
C	well the gold will melt and then the diamond would
A	well can I take it off first as well?
C	yeah
A	a nice stone
B	you can get opals in any colour now though and they aren't all you know that sort of whitish colour with bits in there
A	mm
B	you can get all sorts of colours in them
C	mm
A	I really like this ring cos it has got layers of interest
D	layers of
B	yeah but a lot of people won't wear a lot of people won't wear an opal unless they're your mother's birth sign because they think they're unlucky
A	it is my mother's birth sign
B	same as pearls I think pearls for June
A	we looked it up before
E	you want to be me
A	I want to be mum
A	they're multifaceted and
B	mm
A	there's one that's really green in this ring and one that's much more pink and erm so we're looking it up and we're looking up the superstitions about it and one said yes it's bad luck unless you set it with a diamond
A	by a jeweller
D	yeah
A	and like it's only good luck if you have it set with a diamond
C	uhu
B	yeah
A	so you've gotta get your diamonds as well
B	mm
E	that's quite clever
A	it is
C	bad luck can also be mitigated by using at least eighteen carat gold
B	well my birthstone is supposed to be emerald not never had an emerald in my life ever
A	emeralds are really expensive and really fragile my
B	yeah yeah
A	my erm old boss
C	uhu
A	are they?
C	yeah
A	are they?
C	yeah they made huge great things this big
A	big rubies
C	big you know big
B	your birthstone is really garnet isn't it?
C	five kilogram rubies
A	garnet yeah
C	using high powered lasers
A	oh cool
B	no I've never had
A	an emerald
B	yeah when I was first married only after a year or two I go you know oh I want an emerald eternity ring but they were so expensive and
A	mm
B	don't need a ring to tell you you've been married for an eternity I know that that would be like an
B	mm
D	a bum ring
B	mm
B	you can have one in your nose like
D	mm
B	and then I'll tie a bit of string on it and lead you around when we go shopping
D	doh
B	yeah my mum's was garnet hers was garnet
A	ah that's her star sign
A	you do know all the erm presents for years of marriage?
C	yeah
B	and
A	you've had most of them
B	but I don't know all of them cos there's so many I mean you start off and you've got paper and wood and china and
A	one of my white hairs fell out
D	oh
B	oh dear it's a white one?
A	yeah but it's brown at the end look it's white at the top and then
B	mm
A	right down at the bottom it's brown so you can see where it changed
B	oh
D	it's when the sun caught
A	one of them
B	then it'll grow out
A	another one for the collection
E	you and your stupid hair museum
A	I lost my hair museum shall I start it again? cos this is a good specimen
B	I tell you what
D	yeah but how will you?
A	it's not what
B	our
B	our shower our shower was running slow last week the water wouldn't run down the plughole so he took the thing out you know and he says look at this and there's a big coil of hair and it were you two wash your hair in there
A	was it our hair?
B	yeah
A	we don't live here
B	because
E	we don't live here
B	no I know but when you do
E	it only happens like once a month
B	no but
D	somebody's hair isn't it?
B	erm yeah we lose hair down there
A	over years
B	but ours is short hair but when you have long hair go in there it coils round and you get a big thing of it
E	yeah
A	it's us
B	mm
E	you and your armpit hair you I told you you should trim it if it gets that long
A	look at that
E	don't want to
A	I feel like my housemates might have thrown away my hair museum
A	cos not everyone understands I had a lot of good different
B	is that gotta be your pet now?
A	I just like it I think it's really cool when you can see cos this this grey streak keeps growing and you just see more and more hairs have given up on being having pigment they're like I find them quite regularly now that's why I don't have a hair museum anymore as well cos I keep finding ones that are the first time I found the half white half brown one I was like I have to keep this this is amazing but it does keep happening and they
C	yeah
A	or they fall out and and they're half white half brown as more and more hairs decide they're not gonna be brown anymore
B	yeah
B	that's the main thing
A	yeah I shouldn't go bald
A	yeah well
D	got a long way to go
A	well I'm a woman and it's less common in women and
D	mm
A	also my family history
D	and you don't dye your hair so you've got no hope of
B	I was telling
A	yeah I get asked really often if it's dyed in which I guess it's kind of cool it obviously looks like it's on purpose
B	yeah
A	but it depends how my hair's parted like sometimes it looks really strong and sometimes if it gets blown about a bit
B	mm
A	you just wouldn't know it was there
B	yeah then you'd get one big lump of it where you've split it with
A	but yeah I tend to part it on the grey cos I like the way it looks
B	mm
A	and and until it spreads out and I'll just dye my hair blonde
D	oh you won't look nice with blonde hair
A	it would look unusual
D	yeah with dark skin and blonde hair
B	yeah that's right
A	cos I'm sure it is spreading out
B	I mean you get all these girls and they have their hair all different colours and streaks in and all that you don't have to bother you've just got yours
A	yeah and also there's a lot of stigma attached to female ageing and I am only twenty-seven I found my first white hair when I was sixteen and and I think it's it's quite nice to kind of represent the natural look there's there's one I think fashion editor somewhere who who went grey at a really young age and she just keeps hers grey white all the time and she said
B	mm
A	her mother-in-law is very dubious about it even now she's like I'd dye that if I were you but she well she's got a really young face so it
B	yeah
A	it doesn't look like she's old
B	oh no
A	it just looks like she has grey hair
B	mm
A	and it is unusual cos it's like not that many people go that grey that young
B	no but some men do don't they? I mean like erm
A	dad
B	no but I mean er George Clooney and er Phillip Schofield went totally white really young
A	uhu
B	and they leave it
A	yeah
B	and it looks nice I think
A	yeah I think it does too and I think probably the same
B	I think it
A	amount of women it does happen to but few few leave it natural
B	yeah but it's when they dye their hair and it's dyed that sort of like too dark a colour jet black and it's
A	and all one all one colour
B	and you you look at it and you think that's not natural because it looks so awful you know
B	oh
A	just one colour hair yeah
C	I can see it
A	it's for science
C	I can see it
A	brown white
B	shall we give it a name?
A	yes
C	Andrew
A	Andrew
A	Andrew the hair
B	no it's
A	Andrea
B	mm
E	it's trans
A	it's trans
C	it is trans
A	and it is trans
E	see?
A	it's transitioning
A	between
B	mm
A	brown and white
C	transparent that cos grey hair is
A	trans translucent is that actually
C	you can see through it get it under a microscope
A	do you wanna take it home and put it under your microscope?
C	no not really
A	oh
C	next time in your next time you're in the lab we can have a look at one under the
A	okay
C	microscope if you like
A	we'll have to do that in a fortnight when I'm next down
C	I think
B	mm
C	and take a picture of it
A	I and can put it on the
C	and you could post it on the the
A	what's this? yeah Facebook post
C	on the face-tubes
A	hours of entertainment from looking at my hair museum
B	mm
A	and that's the year that I started the hair museum
B	mm
A	these are my friends
B	mm
A	had a little description
B	oh
A	I think someone threw it away
B	mm
A	I
B	save them all and then I'll knit you a jumper
B	do you know I read about this woman who had this dog I forget what sort it was now had one of these long coated dogs
A	yeah
B	and every time she brushed her dog and combed it she kept the hair and in the end she had somebody weave it for her you know
A	that is nice
B	mm
A	I don't
B	it's it's I know but it's like this erm now these last few years the trend is now that when you have a partner or a loved one cremated they keep something of their ashes some have it made into incorporated in some sort of ornament you know pottery or some even have it tattooed into their skin
A	really?
B	yeah actually have tattoos with some ashes put into the skin so that their partner is always with them
A	mm
B	made into bits of jewellery and that sort of thing and I think that to me is macabre I don't like that I
A	that kind of macabre memento has been going on for centuries though hasn't it? with like little erm scenes made out of your lover's hair
B	oh yes you used to
A	and a little brooch
B	yeah they used to plait little bits of it and put it in mourning brooches or pendants you know
A	mm
B	and a lot of their I mean yeah maybe that but not have ashes put into your you know tattoo or whatever
A	I've also got that shell that's got a lock of my own hair in and some baby teeth
B	I've still got your
A	in case
A	in case
E	you need to be cloned?
A	I need to be cloned
B	who was that the other week?
E	so that's when
A	turnip with a lock of my hair
A	and my baby teeth with stick to
B	yeah did you hear the other week?
E	then draw
B	you know that erm
B	Coleen Rooney her last baby that she had?
E	and just think of you
B	she had the afterbirth made into a pill so she could take them you know and swallow them
A	made into pills?
B	cos it's yeah she had the afterbirth made ground up dried and made into pills
A	just have put it in some bubble and squeak like everyone else
E	yeah
B	and she had it made into a pill so she could take these pills cos they're supposed to be good for you
B	and I thought oh that is disgusting that is yeah
A	yeah I didn't know that you could do that send it off to be made into pills
B	yeah she did
A	pills pills mm I've heard of eating it but I hadn't heard of making it into pills
B	yeah
A	burying it under a rose tree that's something in some cultures is burying it as well
B	oh I've heard a lot of things people bury on superstitions
A	you
B	you're supposed to
A	we did that thing
B	you're supposed to bury glass if you break a mirror
A	yeah
B	you're supposed to bury the bits and then you don't have seven years' bad luck if you bury the glass
A	and set it with a diamond
B	mm
A	do you remember when we did that thing for my wart on my knee? and that worked
B	yeah was that we rubbed it with a?
A	banana peel
B	banana skin yeah
A	yeah and then I bought a or or I sold it to you for twenty P
B	yeah sold it to me and I buried it in a garden
A	and then two weeks later I fell over at school and knocked it right off
D	mm so we
A	so it worked
D	we want our money back
B	oh there's all sorts of sold
B	like when you you spill salt you're supposed to chuck it over your shoulder and mustn't put shoes on the table and
A	don't point at a rainbow
B	oh god I mean we were brought up with cos my mum coming from a foreign
A	were they Spanish superstitions?
B	oh loads of them absolutely loads
B	yeah
A	mm well I know that erm cos my old work colleague's husband is Venezuelan and she said that all his side of the family you must put your handbag on the floor or the money will leave
B	oh
A	so that's a Venezuelan one
B	well we got one what is it? if somebody gives you a pair of gloves as a present there's
A	yeah
B	give some money and you mustn't give anyone a purse or a handbag as a present unless you put some money in it
A	yeah I've heard that one before cos
B	yeah
A	I think you gave me one and there's like
B	yeah
A	fifty P or something in it
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	yeah you gotta put money in a purse or handbag and the oh there's oh so many of them you know you
A	yeah
B	mm
A	haven't we all broken a mirror or two?
B	yeah can't be either you drop them or you knock them over and oh dear
A	that's it
B	yeah oh yeah that's another one if you see one magpie on its own and you don't see a second one that's bad luck unless you do this that and the other and oh dear
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	four for a boy
B	I mean you very rarely see two magpies together it's always one
A	I see a lot of pairs of magpies you just must be really unlucky
A	I'm always seeing two for joy
B	yeah
A	it depends on the time of year surely
D	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I saw two sets of two on the way up here
B	yeah?
C	mm
A	it was like two two is for joy or four for a boy no matter cos I saw them a little bit apart from each other so I reckon
B	yeah yeah
A	it's two twos rather than a four
B	mm
A	and what happens if you see more than seven?
B	oh I don't know
A	start again?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh well so I mean that's like when you
C	what happens if you say hello to jay?
B	if you if you're eating any
B	fruit what got stones in like cherries or anything
A	yeah
B	you you put them all around the edge of the plate and then you have to count them don't you? tinker tailor soldier
A	that's who you're gonna marry?
B	yeah tinker tailor soldier sailor
A	oh thought you were gonna say that's what you were gonna be but it's a sign of the times
B	rich man poor man beggar man thief oh who am I gonna marry? beggar man that's true
A	ah
C	and he gave you Liquorice Allsorts
B	mm
A	that's what he meant
C	yeah
B	yeah that's about it and then he eat them all so I don't get any
C	oh what's happened here?
B	mm
C	the internet has run out of batteries
D	oh
B	but superstitions you know it's it's the same erm I
A	er yeah everything's a sign
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	everything's a sign you know dream of this erm was it if you dream your teeth are falling out that's bad luck
A	it sounds like it
B	erm
A	oh that's horrible
B	and if you dream this
B	think I sent that to a charity I thought oh bugger that I can't be bothered with that anymore
B	I think things just happen or they don't
A	yeah aren't they just ways of working out thoughts from the day I think? it's pretty much the loose idea I've got
B	mm
A	working things out from what's happened to you that day what you might be worried about doing tomorrow
B	yeah
A	I've never had a flying dream that I can remember and that's a really common dream and I don't remember ever having a flying dream
B	oh I did a lot when I was young but the one I do dream a lot even now is that I'm lost oh I have so many dreams that I'm lost I either get off a bus in the middle of the country
C	that's one of
B	and then find that there's and I'm walking and walking and there's nothing there's not a house to be seen and there's nobody around and there's no sign of and I and I just keep and I keep
A	you never did find what you were looking for?
B	no no
A	mm
B	oh I often dream I'm back at school I dream of the old school and all the desks and things you know yeah I'm
A	counting your shells
B	oh when we first started school when we was only in the infants five we had little they used to give us little tobacco tins full of these little erm carry shells
A	yeah
B	for counting I used to love them they were so
A	mm
B	do do your sums you know and counting them out lovely them
A	ah
B	but they're going on now aren't they it's such a big deal about children reading primary school and they can't read and I thought my god I could read when I was five and so could
A	an Ipad
B	yeah go to your bedroom and they go in the bedroom and they play on a Ipad or game
A	yeah
B	for hours and hours and the parents don't have anything to do with them
A	mm
B	the old fashioned games have gone you know
A	yeah
B	now
A	yeah
B	at that school and that is a lot of what she does working with the children doing all sorts of
A	mm
B	activities and making things you know and
A	yeah
B	and she loves it you know and and she's also been on a course to do one to one with children who are a bit backward at something and she's working with them you know and er yeah she loves it but
A	mm?
B	yeah she weren't getting enough money she reckoned and she was struggling with the higher rent and everything so she got a job in somewhere in
A	yeah
B	she reckon she has a lot more money and
A	oh that's alright then as long as she likes it
B	yeah and she's handy cos where the where this office is near
A	mm
B	and they all got the code and if they go up any time when they're not at work like on a weekend Saturday or Sunday they can go and park the car in there and go round the town and they ain't got to pay for car parking
A	that's really good
B	yeah yeah so she's she's now left
A	yeah oh that's good
B	and she
A	yeah
B	she said and do have spells cos that you have spells and then you go into remission and you're alright for so long and then you have
A	yeah
B	and I might have to have a few days off and they said they were quite happy with that
A	yeah
B	so they took her on anyway they said they they'd work round that so yeah so she's
A	that's good it's good that they
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	rightly so
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah well that's the thing I was thinking if she's given up her job at the school which she was really enjoying cos she couldn't afford her rent anymore to do something she didn't enjoy that would be really sad but if she is
B	mm
A	enjoying it then that's not so bad
B	yeah
A	but yeah I know it's it's hard when your wages don't match your rent
B	no
A	yeah and a lot of people today and a lot of people are struggling and have to take on a second job or something
B	mm
A	to to meet the rent
B	do you miss your job?
A	at
B	mm?
A	nah
B	no?
A	no I miss some of the people and I'm I'm glad that I did it I always knew that I could do office work and I did office work and I was good at it but I didn't enjoy it
B	no
A	it's a difference and erm
B	yeah
A	and it was getting worse like the management style
B	yeah
A	wasn't agreeing with me
B	yeah
A	for me to go and do that instead
B	yeah
A	so I did
B	mm
A	that's good and I'm still looking at things to do which
B	mm
A	I can go and I can write articles and I can do my illustration I've been doing more illustration recently
B	yeah
A	got a couple of pictures in a bar slash gallery down town
B	yeah
A	and er yeah just getting back into that really
B	mm
A	doing doing mine and
B	oh yeah yeah
A	so that's what I fill my time with
B	and funny songs
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well it's good cos I've got enough money at the moment for however long it lasts I've got enough money to like pay the rent and feed ourselves and er
B	yeah
A	keep everything afloat and then in our other time
B	yeah
A	nearly five years but yeah so I'm just like working on doing things that I wanna do
B	mm
A	so that's quite nice really
B	yeah
A	and I'm really lucky to have that opportunity cos a lot of people don't and so I'm gonna make the most of it for however long is lasts cos I
B	yeah
A	rent being what it is job being what it is
B	yeah well I think that just clicked right as well
A	yeah yeah
B	splitting the bills it's a big help isn't it?
A	huge yeah a huge help like we are actually able to work
B	yeah
A	like I might have to really go and get a full time job like at
B	oh yeah
A	self-employed so you know it's nice to have that base level that you know you can always cover the rent cos the rent's really reasonable cos we live in a shared house and our landlords are reasonable people and yeah it works out that we get to be quite flexible
B	mm
A	with what we do with our time and
B	yeah
A	because otherwise he wouldn't get any illustration done and that's what he's and to do anything else he does his music as well he has a lot of a lot of things to fit in
B	well being self-employed
A	yeah
B	as well and being flexible is a big help cos I mean like you say
A	yeah yeah
B	you've gotta step in haven't you? or if he is you know I mean
A	yeah yeah
B	you just don't know what'll crop up and then
A	exactly the flexibility can it works both ways
B	it does
A	yeah
B	and like
A	it does
B	when you go on holiday then they just get a bit of extra help in and
A	yeah and yeah
B	and you can have a couple of weeks away
A	yeah that's exactly that's exactly how it works and it's cos especially for me and
B	mm
A	that's really good
B	yeah
A	need to do that more often
C	about time
B	yeah
C	we were making a move
A	oh okay have to
D	yeah if you're going to empty your stuff
A	go and pack up all my stuff
D	before you get to
B	yeah if you've gotta pop in and see
A	yeah
D	yeah
