A	so we're still on uh Asian Network then?
B	I've enjoyed it more than I thought I would like
A	yeah um
B	it's better than like the pop like
A	it yeah
B	which ones?
A	at the far end of the
B	of the radio stations you mean?
A	stations
B	well I suppose it's the night time like
A	but these ones that that some of them are um putting like this one's probably more sort of
B	yeah more upbeat
A	yeah
B	but I'd much rather listen to this than like um you know like some of those bands like the Saturdays or like One Direction or what that other one you know
B	no but Justin Byber or whatever he's called
A	bieber
B	Justin Bieber
B	I was in um uh Primark the other day and they had T-shirts with Justin Bieber's face on that said I love Justin Bieber on the front
B	like what
A	he's uh he's a great performer uh
B	is he? He's a great something
B	Cos if you just listen to him for like five seconds you realize he's like the most insanely annoying person in the universe
B	he's very annoying
A	no I don't think it's his his voice I think
B	no it's not his voice
A	no like if if it was like The Voice or something like and you knew uh you know
B	no he is a good singer
A	no I  no I  mean if you couldn't see his face then I think like you'd you'd probably like have a different you know what I mean?
B	I suppose it's not just about like the song is it? Or him singing in fact because really if we're honest there's loads of people who who are good singers
A	well d'you think it's it's more just sort of his
B	well he's just a pop
A	yeah
B	no
A	um
B	it's quite funny
A	really?
B	some bits are
A	well yeah but
B	you know
A	fair enough
B	it's not like it's like tortuous for them
A	yeah
B	think if you know what you're letting yourself into it's not like they're just like
A	oh yeah yeah right yeah yeah he was annoying wasn't he?
B	I used to watch that
A	Noel Noel Edmonds
B	crinkley Bottom
A	yeah yeah the the uh dilapidated uh
B	blobby World
A	uh theme park did that theme park with the Polo Tower
B	ah poor old
A	ah no one still not enough people go there
B	well they're trying to I mean
A	there was like during the you know in the during the sort of conveyancing boom um
B	yeah
A	the
B	God yeah
A	uh
B	sort of got lost
A	it shouldn't have been that hard should it?
B	no it shouldn't have been that hard
A	think we got on the bus eventually yeah
B	we did yeah yeah
A	no it it's actually
B	I think  I think  was because they'd moved the bus stops hadn't they like there was like they're doing loads of road works and they were like move to such and such a street but obviously we didn't know where that was
A	yeah
B	well I got to know it quite well I mean I passed me driving test in
A	oh
B	well it is and it isn't
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh right
B	it was good but there's a lot of roundabouts
A	yeah I guess uh
B	yeah
A	getting in  getting in  this guessing that lane and uh
B	yeah
A	it seems  it seems  really easy
B	you don't even think about it like
A	yeah yeah
B	when like it's funny cos when you
A	it's sort of
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah
A	uh but but if you experience it of course you you would just know how the curve how how to draw the curve out of the shape that you turned in the steering wheel so
B	yeah
A	you never forget? Yeah well yeah I think I I
B	I think so
A	yeah
B	did you? Yeah but that's still not a long time really not compared to some people
A	no I mean I I probably only like like a few months really uh that I had like of good decent driving um
B	but I I suppose it's like anything I mean
A	yeah
B	you know like
A	that's yeah
B	fifteen years or whatever
A	yeah
B	so
A	um
B	as Gok Wan would say it's all about the confidence
B	essentially on a bike turn your legs round
A	yeah I think it is partly about confidence but um drinking and driving don't go together
B	no
A	so it's also  it's also  about the coordination
B	but I can see why they don't like I mean even like drinking and cycling don't really go like
A	I think no I I think that you can after after a couple uh
B	no
A	oh really? Yeah you see I I don't think I'd be um I don't I'd be like that if I was
B	you just think I wanna get home
A	uh I don't think I'd be like that if I was um uh drunk or uh I don't think
B	I dunno I think it's
A	I don't think drink drink would make  would make  make me go really fast unless of course like there was no one in sight
B	but I think it's like the exercise of it like I think it's sort of it must drive it round your body faster
A	uh
B	like you know
A	yeah
B	so it must like hit you faster
A	although
B	but I don't know
A	I think it would
B	I'm always a bit cautious thought I don't think I would ever
A	I I remember a
B	I know but I think uh
A	so it's I think  I think  when you're talking to somebody you sort of focus you really put a lot of focus in the the other person like um that they they yeah
B	I know but I still get pain off that
A	yeah
B	um it was just like a
A	yeah
B	it was so painful
A	yeah
B	it's not that bad really considering we've been here for cycling every single day for two and a half years
A	that was a yeah it was a really quite
B	I know
A	uh it wasn't a crash or a slip yeah it didn't have any external cause it was  it was  entirely your own
B	not caused by anyone else
A	and and as such wasn't so much an accident
B	but look I've still got scars like
A	uh you have to scrub them though don't you when you're uh? To stop them
B	no it's not
A	no I mean like before the
B	I did
A	I guess they they'll go down eventually
B	ah yeah it's just a scar now I mean it course it'll go
A	but um
B	I've got plenty
A	uh yeah
B	I had one on me face d'you remember when I
A	that's gone hasn't it yeah so uh but but no I mean uh I think it is it can be dangerous like with a lot of cars but I think if if I was uh like uh riding myself I would try and avoid um a lot of cars uh
B	I don't know I mean cars are like in most of
A	you've told me about loads of things like like like near near um yeah things have nearly happened to you and you've had to sort of shelter people and stuff uh or like
B	some people are bad yeah
A	you've seen accidents you've seen like bumps and stuff um
B	I have yeah
A	yeah
B	but like the car just went into the wheel and the wheel was like you know bent sort of that way and uh na they weren't happy
A	um how uh how did that how d'that happen?
B	so um I was  I was  waiting at
A	yeah
B	so even though like so I'm coming up to the roundabout even though you should give way to the person on the right
A	yeah
B	so it's like a so you can go then
A	yeah yeah
B	D'you know what I mean if you if they're not gonna move then you should move but sometimes this ends in like a weird stalemate like
B	where everyone's everyone's just stopped at the roundabout and so then everyone goes at the same time
A	but even
B	so it can be really dangerous but
A	but even so you can
B	yeah so
A	yeah
B	so the cyclist ahead of me just went round
A	yeah
B	and like they just
A	yeah
B	and the cyclist was like you look what you've done to my bike rah rah rah
B	sorry I'll just close that
A	like you can't it you're not  you're not  insured you don't  you don't  pay road tax so you you you have
B	you can get bike insurance yeah
A	I I
B	I don't know I mean you can though you can specifically claim I mean I've seen I've seen it advertised for like claiming for that sort of thing
A	sort of thing is
B	the other person's liable? No you don't have to have bike insurance no
A	yeah
B	but um
A	but but if you didn't then but even if it was caused by someone else like what would you do if I mean cos I imagine if even if you don't have insurance of a bike not if it's someone else's fault they they would have to pay anyway wouldn't they so?
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	um but I don't know it's never happened to me thankfully
A	um
B	but
A	yeah
B	I know
B	but just one of those things but
A	yeah I guess you it's a much more because
B	I think so maybe
A	yeah I mean there's there's always like it's it's always gonna be you know hard to prove liability um but but I suppose we if you're looking at car versus car then of course you've got the  you've got the  the evidence on both cars but whereas if it's car versus bike it may  it may  not have any evidence on the car
B	yeah
A	whereas the bike could be just be totally mangled or something like for
B	but you can get  you can get  bike insurance though
A	compulsory car
B	yeah
A	and no
B	yeah
A	uh but they'd they'd just take their chances and pay when they had to pay
B	well it's there's usually witnesses like if you have a crash like that where someone just
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah I mean well it's it's it is it's different isn't it? Cos like
B	but I mean I've seen like that that that one roundabout that I was talking about at
B	that's true but they're genuinely surprised
A	you're you're you're probably probably a lot less uh likely to get into an accident if you if you're riding the wrong way cos they they can just see you and like
B	it was pretty bad though
A	I mean
B	no
A	yeah
B	so if people back off I normally give them like a big thumbs up like
B	and I've seen so many people like just like tipped off the bike there probably not really hurt but like just pushed
A	mm
B	I'm lucky not to have had a big thing
A	alright shall  shall I  pause this uh?
B	I don't mind I mean
A	right
B	depends how it's going
A	uh well I'll I'll pause it and then do like an extra bit
B	what's it on?
A	I don't actually know how to turn it off though
B	okay
