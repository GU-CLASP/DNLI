A	yeah you're the first one
B	really
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	have you been here since twelve o'clock?
A	half twelve we came in yeah
B	oh dear okay well I will try and talk for England talk for England then
C	I think we did
A	might do another one like
C	yeah
B	maybe make it the first something or other of the month or something like that
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	I haven't no
C	so we're doing more on like what what the corpus is and how we use it and how we and how it's like fed into the products so it might be quite nice to do one after we've finished all these workshops
A	yeah
B	yes so then people can see what comes out at the other end
A	just because people will be a bit more aware
C	yeah
B	mm so how how many volunteers do you have altogether doing recordings? is it thousands?
C	erm
A	yeah
C	and we've just hit eight million words transcribed this morning so
B	wow
A	we're nearly there we only want well we want about eleven and a half
C	it's yeah
A	so
B	right
A	we're nearly there
C	so it is exciting
C	it's really like satisfying seeing it going up and
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yes I saw you had been doing some tweeting on social media
C	oh yeah cos we were at the Festival of Ideas erm
B	were you? oh well that should generate some more people shouldn't it
A	yeah hopefully yeah we've got quite
C	yeah we've already got some recordings
A	I think we've got about seventy emails
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah people signing up so hopefully even if ten of those actually contribute then
C	that's amazing
A	yeah
B	yes
C	because it's only
A	yeah
B	how how do people find it works works best by organising a bit of an event like come along and and talks or just having lunch with a friend or something like that?
C	most of them are just having lunch with a friend or like a family putting it on while they're they
A	having dinner or something
C	yeah
B	yes
C	I mean we don't ever listen to the recordings so it's
B	yeah
C	yeah so we don't really know what what the content is often
A	yeah
C	but it is incredible we get like we are starting to process like the
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	I'm interested in the different types of language that we use for different occasions
C	mm
A	yeah
B	so you were talking about saying what are the most common words being used at Cambridge University Press and that's interesting
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I imagine it is different from what you would get if you went to a school playground or even if you went to a pub
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah in fact we are going to when we've got those all the conversations in from last time they they are not quite fully transcribed yet we will put together all the recordings made at lunch time here
B	right
C	and find out kind of do we have a wider vocabulary than average or not? is it smaller? or
A	yeah just do a little bit of analysis on it
B	oh dear right
A	oh no don't worry
B	it might not be what we want to know might it?
C	just chuck in some long words
B	it would be serendipity if we did turn out some
C	what do you do here?
B	what do I do? I do marketing in the bibles department and it's good to come and talk to you today because there's only four of us and the other three have all just all left to go to a trip
C	ah
A	ah so you're on your own today?
B	I am on my own well this afternoon anyway
A	ah oh no
C	so there's only four people in the bible
B	yes yes
C	it's tiny
B	yeah and the others are all men
C	oh really
A	ah
B	yes so so it is nice to nice and come and talk
A	yeah
C	and is there a lot like you know the
B	how do we do it?
C	how what do you? where do you have to go and?
B	well principally through the trade through
B	yeah there's a
C	mm
A	mm
B	but if you think about it there aren't many shops that specialise in fishing books or sports books or politics books
C	no
A	no that's true
B	on their own or even cookery books although that's probably the one of the biggest areas
A	yeah
C	quite a good idea for a shop isn't it a cookery book shop?
A	yeah
B	well yeah you could have the authors along to do their tastings
C	mm
A	yeah
B	I guess it's not really it is not really us though is it? is not very
C	no
A	no
C	I don't think it would go down well here but er
B	yeah so there's lots of Christian bookshops for example the
C	yeah we cycle past that
B	yeah
A	is that is that the only one in
B	it is now there used
A	yeah
B	to be an SPCK which got taken over by another organisation and didn't flourish
A	oh no
B	shall we say and there's there is a little one in
C	ah yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah I think I know
B	yeah so diminishing market but you know like any other bookshop they're subject to the internet
A	yeah yeah
C	and what other books is it just pure bibles or are there other books that are published connected to it or?
B	er its well there's two sorts of books there's bibles and prayer books
C	mm hm
B	but there there's no there's no new authors
C	so it's just
B	if there was a book about bibles you know like a commentary then that would be done by the religious studies
C	oh okay
A	oh yeah of course yeah
B	so we specialise in the fine binding
C	oh wow
A	oh wow
C	that must be such a lovely job to put those together and work with all those lovely materials
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah it's
C	and do you get them
B	well some of them are bound in the Netherlands which is why my colleagues have gone to see the people who do the binding
C	ah
A	ah so they're going over
B	we used to have our we used to do printing and binding here
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but of course we haven't got a binder any more and we don't we don't really have the printers any more
C	yeah I'm not sure that you would cope with India
B	am I allowed to say negatives?
C	yeah that's fine
B	although I am being recorded here
B	yeah so so we use a range of specialist printers and binders
C	yeah
B	according to whatever translation it is and what the edition calls for
A	mm
C	ah so they so they get they're all translated here as
B	erm well the king James bible was translated here part of it but not in my time
C	oh
B	obviously
C	mm hm
B	he's the production
A	ah
B	so they get them made by people who can do that sort of work there's not very many people who do prints on India paper these days
A	no
C	no I can imagine
B	and some of the work's done by hand it's it is very different from any other books the press does
C	yeah
A	yeah I presume is it a lot more expensive to get all that done?
B	yes especially when they're bound in goat skin leather
A	oh wow
B	and if you print onto India paper it has to be done very slowly
A	mm
B	because the paper's thin
A	yeah
B	and sometimes you're printing red and black at the same time
C	so
A	wow
B	has a cost implication
C	and how often
A	mm
C	like how many are printed a year roughly? or is that not something
B	oh that's classified information
B	yeah we we do ten different I can tell you we do ten different bible translations
A	yeah
C	mm hm
A	ten now that's good
B	altogether
A	yeah
B	but the king James has been on the list since the seventeenth century so we've got most of that
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	no well
C	that's amazing
A	that is amazing
B	has been continuously printing and publishing the Bible since 1591 and it's
A	almost from the beginning
B	yeah
C	that's incredible isn't it
A	yeah
B	in the beginning
B	yeah cos we we did the Geneva bible which was sort of
C	mm hm
B	but that was our that was the first one
C	ah
B	there is there is a small display of bibles all the time
C	yeah cos I've seen the one in the corner
A	mm
C	but like in the
B	in the
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah the main the one in the big one in the the case
C	yeah in the that side round
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	oh I will have to go and have another look
A	yeah
B	yeah perhaps we should get
C	a talk on it
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	cos it is fascinating to think that that's been here the whole time and it is still here
A	yeah
C	I mean I dunno where we are
B	yeah
C	we don't really have any contact with like books or anything
B	oh well we've actually got bookshelves with all our editions on if you would like to pop by sometime
A	ah
C	oh I'd love to yeah love to see it
B	and you can see them and handle them and smell them
C	oh whereabouts do you sit?
B	because they're fragrant
A	just
C	I my friend's a publishing assistant for humanities I know where she sits like in the corner
A	so if you go
B	so
B	yeah
A	oh okay
C	okay we'll come and definitely come and see them
B	yeah that would be good
C	yeah you must be the only team printing on that kind of paper here and I don't know are there other books that are done?
A	I don't know
C	cos
A	I wouldn't have thought so no
B	no you don't think of anybody else who prints on India paper
C	I don't think
A	you could try
B	no erm
A	no
B	we we do undertake production work for other publishers
C	yeah
B	of people who are producing bibles sometimes they want to do a special binding
A	yeah wow
B	which is unpredictable
C	yeah that's really nice though to be able to work with like those materials you know
A	yeah
B	yeah you feel a you feel there's a physical product which is not the same as everything else and it's not
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's nice that it hasn't like followed all the other books that are just like glossy paper or
C	yeah
A	or online it is nice that it is still
C	and kind of the cheapest you can get them out
A	yeah
C	you know it is like still like a beautiful
A	yeah
C	although I erm
B	mm
C	I did I did a master's and the the amount of books that are being produced are a beautiful quality now because people have got their Kindles for their like soft paperbacks
A	yeah
C	that actually when people want to buy a book they want to buy a beautiful so beautiful book
A	yeah
C	so that kind of type of book is is actually like increasing which is so lovely to see
B	I see
A	yeah yeah
C	and overall sales of books aren't really going down in like in trade I don't know I'm sure like
A	mm
B	yeah so if you want if you wanted to if you want to pay as little as possible why would you have a physical product?
C	yeah if it is the kind of book that you read and then you don't want it on your shelves it is like
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think with the Bible as well erm certainly most of our customers at least intend to read it regularly and many of them do a lot in the clergy
A	mm
B	and in the United States
C	and I guess you
B	so they're using their bible several times a day
C	and it needs to be
A	yes
C	really good condition like a really good solid book because if you are flicking through it and reading from it and touching it every day you need it to like be resilient and
A	yeah
B	yeah it's a working it's a working it is a working book
C	yeah
A	mm
C	but like one you dip in and out of so normally you would read a book in order but I know it's different if you kind of open it at different places you've got to protect the spine in a different way so I guess
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah but the book the books are sewn the books are sewn
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	as well as glued which gives it a greater flexibility and the most luxurious ones have got
C	wow
A	wow
B	and they're edge lined which again makes it more flexible you can actually roll a bible up and it should be okay yeah
A	really?
C	wow
B	I could hold any of my bibles up one page
C	and they'd be fine
B	mm
A	just
B	it hasn't failed yet
A	wow that is really good
B	I don't do it very often but sometimes when we give talks we we do that
A	just to test
C	oh you should do a talk in the in the library I want I want to know all about
C	yeah
B	erm I do talk a I do talk on the history of bible translation in
C	oh do you?
A	mm
C	you'll have to tell us when the next one is
B	I could do that yeah
A	yeah
B	but but my colleague
C	yeah
A	mm ah
C	yeah a very specialist job
B	he will he will show you the bits of leather
C	yeah and the knowledge
B	mm maybe what maybe what we should do is advertise erm your erm
A	yeah
B	can you do something like that sort of say after church today if you go to room go to this room
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	have a cake and talk
C	yeah
B	if people signed up for it
A	yeah
B	and make some money for the something that the church is doing
A	yeah
C	yeah so we the the church could have the eighteen pound per hour
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	because I was thinking because I am involved in the the
A	yeah we it there's
C	yeah definitely
B	or even the press could raise funds for that matter
A	there's nothing to like say who
B	right
A	there's nothing to say that I have to keep it there's nothing to say that I have to give it out to everybody but it is there then to do
B	mm
C	yeah
A	like you could use it as funds
B	okay so if I said come come and talk for an hour
A	yeah
B	have a cup of tea and a cake and the money's going to
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	absolutely fine and anyone can set these groups up like so erm we can give you some of these leaflets it just kind of shows
B	yeah I haven't seen I haven't got that one
C	erm
A	we kind of say a maximum of five speakers per group just cos it's
B	five?
C	yeah but there's nothing to say you can kind of do two groups or
B	two tables?
C	yeah
A	as long as the background noise isn't too much but I'm sure it would be fine
C	it is just
B	maybe I
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	she could lead a table as well
C	yeah definitely
A	yeah yeah
C	because the thing is when you have more than five people quite often erm what will happen is you'll have two conversations going on and that's really hard for the transcribers to to write down
A	mm cos people tend to like group off don't they?
B	they do and then you have to try and work out who it is
A	yeah
C	yeah so here's yeah
B	yeah I find that you get men tend to branch off and have one conversation and women have another quite often as well it seems to work in in gender groups within a larger group
C	mm
A	yeah
C	we'll have to look out for that in our larger
A	yeah look out we can do that
B	can you?
A	kind of search yeah
B	I would be interested to know if that's true or whether it is just the people I know
A	yeah
C	yeah we can have a look into our larger recordings and see
A	mm
C	than women
B	that doesn't surprise that doesn't surprise me at all although my husband would refute it would contest it
A	yeah
C	I was talking this morning erm
A	to not to not
C	and so
B	mm
C	erm he this person explained it a bit like erm Japanese was more like bowling where the kind of the ball goes and then it settles and then you start and erm
A	yeah
C	like America is more like throwing the ball around but it's not allowed to hit the ground
A	oh yeah
B	oh dear
A	that's a good way of
B	yeah
C	and that's a really good cultural
A	yeah a bit hard when they are talking together
C	yeah a pointless conversation
B	well
A	no
C	no
B	I mean you get people like that you know you think they're finished and then they start again
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and it turns out to have been a semicolon rather than a full stop
C	yeah cos I was on the phone last night to some erm Americans well like five o'clock and I was just trying to go cos I had I needed to leave at I couldn't even say goodbye so I just had to leave and send them a note saying because it was a group of like six people
A	yeah
C	and I was just like I'm so sorry but I can't I didn't want to interrupt this flow
B	oh dear
C	yeah and just talking and talking and talking
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	but this leaflet erm kind of says erm
B	oh it's
A	you can have you got a smartphone or has anyone?
B	well I have but I am not
A	it should they usually have a voice recording
C	I mean you you are very welcome to borrow these so if cos these are so simple
B	are they better?
C	you just turn them on and then just they are so simple to use so if like if you
B	yeah okay
C	knew you were going to do it at the weekend just come like take them on Friday and erm bring them back on Monday would be fine
B	oh actually that would be that would be most reassuring because I am not sure about this
C	yeah
A	yeah when we've
C	and then you erm
B	yes
C	erm and then everyone needs to sign one of those and then that's all you have to do
B	right
A	do you do you want to take some of these from us so you don't have to print any off?
B	oh yes please because I could then leave it leave it somewhere
C	yeah
A	is that is that too many?
B	right
C	and if you know anyone from Wales Northern Ireland or Scotland we are just desperate for conversations from those areas
B	oh
C	is he?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	and I know he knows two people at his church because I know them as well
C	who are Scottish
B	who are both Scottish gentlemen
A	ah that would be great if
B	of a
A	no no
C	we want all ages
A	we've got someone that's three
B	oh
A	and up to someone that's like
B	three?
A	yeah up to someone that's like ninety something
C	my grandad is ninety-one and he's in it so
A	yeah
B	that's interesting cos I could
C	yeah
A	yeah that's yeah if you yeah
B	but whether you'd get a three year old many three year olds wouldn't sit still and and talk would they
B	oh I see yeah
C	yeah
A	but if you can get them then it is fine it doesn't matter
B	yeah okay
A	as long as obviously anyone under eighteen we have to get their parents to sign the form erm
B	yes right
C	but it's
A	yeah
B	but what's mostly so what is most useful? Scottish and Welsh and Northern Ireland did you say?
C	yeah I mean we've got a lot obviously it is much easier to get conversations from people when we meet them so from
C	like the age group
B	yeah
C	because it's students that see eighteen pounds and it's like
B	money
B	well most people do when I mention it to them but actually getting them to to do it is more tricky
C	yeah
A	yeah that's and it's the first one as well which is the most tricky as soon as you've done one you know how easy it is you can carry on
C	yeah
A	erm
C	yeah seems to be but
B	okay
C	like and we'll
A	yeah
B	yeah yes I suppose we know people in
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but at the
C	yeah
B	and does it have to be just a normal chat or could it be something like a meeting?
C	it can be I mean it is supposed to be like kind of everyday conversation so
B	right so
C	erm I mean it could be a meeting er but like not a very staged one because there is a box for colleagues here
A	mm if people
C	and acquaintances
B	ah I see yeah
A	yeah and then these are kind like the types of speech so if you're discussing something or you're
B	oh
A	you're there trying to I don't know
B	make arrangements
A	it's fine
B	yeah
A	as long as there's not kind of one person that's doing all the talking and everybody's joining in and
B	monopolising
A	yeah
C	yeah but that's a great that's a great idea to do it with the church lot and
B	yeah give it a try give it a try
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	are there any subjects that are off limits?
C	no everything
A	nope
B	right
A	yeah and we anonymise it
B	oh well I
A	no that's fine
C	a lot of people do
B	like talk about their medical condition or something
C	yeah and it is all anonymised so we take everyone's name and everyone's erm like big places so we wouldn't take London out because that's not you know
B	right
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	but erm
A	but if someone says something like
C	yeah I live in place
A	yeah we would we would take that out
B	yes
C	yeah
A	unless they're talking about
B	yes right
C	and if you're interested we can show the database where we put it all into and how we use it because we we never we just read a transcript we'd search for a word and see
A	mm no
B	right
C	I mean some researchers might
A	we just put all of the transcriptions from all the recordings into one
B	mm
C	pot
A	pot so and then look at all of that language in that rather than individual
C	yeah
B	I see
C	so we'd say okay we we really into we are writing this ELT textbook for you know teenagers so let's look at this age to this age erm and we want the we want British English not
B	mm
A	you can search by age or region or
B	ah
C	gender anything
A	yeah
B	I seem to have quite a few friends whose first language was not English or who come from other countries but I guess that's probably a
C	yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	they are quite varied because I've got a
C	yeah yeah
B	has a particular sort of pronunciation and I've got another friend who is Serbian who speaks English as a second language
C	yeah and we've got quite a few people from it's like it's obviously quite difficult thing like the British National Corpus because you know what makes you a native or makes a non-native? what makes you an expert user what makes you a learner? it's it's very quite hard to cut these things up and say well you weren't born here so you can't contribute it it it feels wrong
A	yeah yeah
C	so we do have you know it's a kind of it's a little it's like a grey area cos we don't want to be kind of saying well you know you moved here when you was ten but that doesn't you can't call it cos obviously they're British and
A	yeah
B	yes that's true
C	as an expert user then it is kind of going to go in the project
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's a field
B	which country is
C	and the recording information sheets you can find on the website which is here
B	yeah I think I have seen I have seen them before
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if you want to take more you can but if you only want to take one that's that's fine
B	erm I suppose I'll I'll take two
C	okay brilliant
B	thank you very much
C	anyway thanks
A	thank you
B	thanks
