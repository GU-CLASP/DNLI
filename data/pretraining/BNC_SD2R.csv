B	I don't know where I don't think it is in the hip
C	is it in the groin?

A	so it needs to be
B	compared to the other side
C	yeah
B	you can
C	yeah
B	and I
A	you should go to physiotherapy again shouldn't you
B	I well they er er all they did was stretch my leg and er they didn't put any hands-on
A	mm

C	yes
B	I don't think you have a choice do you
C	that is ain't it
A	yep
C	yeah
A	no
A	choose the path you want to take
C	well sometimes you don't get a chance to choose the path
A	no
C	the path is
A	not always
C	chosen for you
B	true
A	mm
B	you can't
C	no
A	and you'll never know the other bit
C	no you'll never know the other bit
A	what would've happened if um
C	what would've happened if you'd have taken the left-hand path instead of the right-hand path
B	yeah
A	mm
B	could've been far worse couldn't it
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I wonder if you
A	sliding Doors
C	if you  if you  have a a life elsewhere where you er took that path
B	took the other path
C	yeah
B	parallel
C	yeah
B	can you just imagine?
A	it is that film Sliding Doors
C	that is Sliding Doors
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	where she shows both sides of it
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	say that's the way it's gonna go
C	yes
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah that's what you need really is satisfaction isn't it
C	course it is
B	I think er if you've got satisfaction that's that's the best bit
C	and others decide not to take the path at all and just sit round eating and getting fat
A	yep
C	Don't they?
A	mm
C	when you watch them
A	A lot do with your character though isn't it? Whether you've got ambition or not
C	well yeah
A	well mostly to do with parents
C	I think it's a lot to do with parents
B	yeah
C	our parents were both self-employed
A	yeah
C	you know
B	I think it also depends how strong you are as a character
C	yeah
B	because some people just give up
A	mm
B	it gets to a point where you can you just wanna give up
C	yeah
B	no
C	no
B	mm
C	t the weekend
A	mm
C	well they've got money to do all the tattoos and all stuff
B	but is it the case the people are doing the tattoos are using them as experiments to do the tattoos on?
B	so therefore these people wanna tattoo so therefore they'll be like the guinea-pig
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	or they're trying their tattoos out
C	mm
C	with the kids I mean the fifteen-year-old kids that
B	mm
C	you know like
B	mm
C	they're
A	mm
C	but as for the older people I don't know what happened to them
B	mm
C	position
A	mm
B	I think you're right when er huh you said about parents
C	where people live come into it quite a bit don't it
A	yeah
B	because if they see it happening around them
C	yeah
B	then it becomes the norm
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so therefore that's what you do
C	that's what you do
A	mm
B	but it's also like hm er
A	mm
C	it is a culture thing
A	I mean you you said from going to school that you were never given the the even thought that you could go on to further education
C	never
A	or anything
C	never given the chance
A	left school early
C	didn't even know there was a further education
A	whereas it was pushed my school you went
B	but was that because again back to that area
A	well mm
C	I don't know but we were expected as a secondary school to take up not the academics
B	the the apprenticeship route
C	but the apprenticeship route
B	yeah
C	and if you were any good you er you got an apprenticeship
B	got offered an apprenticeship
C	I mean it didn't cost anything
A	but you weren't given loads of options were you?
C	we were given no options
B	I don't think you I
A	no
B	but going back I don't think the options were there as such
C	well
B	careers people
C	the careers people
A	mm
C	especially what they looked at as second class citizens
B	yeah but at your
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and on the  on the  other side you had people going either into work at Carters or Laurence and Scott
A	mm
C	yes
B	or Autowrappers was Autowrappers?
C	yeah
B	autowrappers
C	heatrae
B	heatrae
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	british tin box company the
A	mm
B	you know
C	yeah
B	of you had what you had
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	Cos that was people
A	on rotation
B	um
C	you worked there didn't you?
B	start-rite
B	start-rite shoes
C	yeah
B	mhm
C	A huge Courtaulds factory
B	yeah
C	and either they give it to you or they didn't
B	mm
C	loads of work about
B	but if you look at what work is available now
A	mm
B	it's all shop work
C	well it's all service
B	it's all it's service industries
C	yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	that's all that is er is around
C	yeah
B	where people take some more people on
A	mm
C	that's right
B	you know
C	but I mean this is  this is  half the reason half the people er leave the countryside and go to huge cities
B	yeah
C	which isn't that long ago
B	machinery has
C	yeah
B	taken over hasn't it
C	yeah
B	and the way you farm things make er makes it easier
C	yep
C	but that used to be good  that used to be good  but now uh I I feel so sorry for the kids nowadays
B	well they
C	no
B	you know I I don't need this qualification
C	well that's true
B	but you do need the qualification
C	yeah
B	no I don't
B	otherwise you're just gonna end up doing nothing
C	yeah
B	which is why which is what I've witnessed
C	well er
B	recently
C	well you have
B	yeah
C	but as you say they don't they don't take on in
B	you know
C	yeah
A	mm
B	I says because the majority of people that at your stage five ten fifteen it will happen
C	yeah
A	mm
B	what I felt like saying is but in some cases you'll nick what you want so
C	well that's true
A	oh dear
C	that is true
A	huh
C	in some cases that that's what they do
B	mm
B	but it's okay for him to do it at weekends as long as he doesn't during the week
B	that's the attitude of one family
C	hm
B	that I've heard of recently
A	really?
B	yeah
A	huh
B	because it's er because again it's in this area
A	yeah
B	that's where it all happens from
C	yeah
B	and you're thinking to yourself this is not
C	it's not good is it
B	it's not good
A	they just they don't care do they
B	you know
A	parents just don't care
B	it's like  it's like  drinking
A	yeah
C	well yeah
B	I mean you know I'm not  I'm not  knocking it or anything
C	course you do
A	mm
C	that's what teenagers are about
B	and you know and
C	yeah it's
B	you you you do
A	mm
B	is not it's not right
C	that's not right
B	mm
C	cocktail cabinets then didn't they
C	rum and butter sweets
A	sweet
C	oh
A	mm
B	mm
C	sixteen years old
B	but you  but you
A	didn't need to be
B	no but you
C	you do
B	but unfortunately youngsters at the moment don't learn from that experience
C	no
B	you know
C	that's the trouble
B	yeah
C	oh I can have I can drink this and I can drink that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you're thinking er why are you
A	why?
B	why do you need to do?
C	yeah
A	it's er it's wrong it's
B	why do you need to do it?
A	yeah
C	Strange
A	they haven't got enough confidence in themselves
B	you know
C	yeah
B	you know to have a good time you've gotta get absolutely blottoed
A	mm
B	mm
C	no
B	yeah
C	where do they get their money nowadays? When there's hardly any work
A	mm
C	Norwich
B	I think a lot of them drink before they go
C	yeah
B	so once they're there they just top it up
C	they do
A	yeah
C	we had a
A	mm
C	when we were doing this um what was it? The the first aid stuff
A	mm
C	we had that old boy
A	we did
C	he worked on a voluntary bus
A	mm
C	um collecting these
B	mm
C	young girls
B	what the SOS bus?
C	yeah
A	he used to stress all the time
C	yeah

A	yeah
C	but these
A	Cos they looked so awful

A	mm
C	pff
A	yeah
C	clean vest and pants in case you had an accident
A	mm
B	I
A	mm

B	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm

A	mm
C	but I mean that's only recently that the they've had pubs open all the time
B	but it's made no difference
C	that's made no difference at all
B	I think in some respects that side of it apart from the number of pubs closing down because there isn't the money around that bit's alright
C	the binge drinking
B	Thursday Friday

B	yeah
C	well only a lawn
A	what with grass?
B	yeah you
A	no
C	think of the  think of the  maintenance that it took with this water fountain
B	well you think of how how many times they've changed the footpaths around
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	right
C	yeah
B	so years ago it was we'll get rid of all the flagstones
C	yep
B	and we'll tarmac it
C	yeah
A	mm
B	few years later all the tarmac comes up
C	mm
B	and they start putting Brickweave down
C	brickweave down
A	mm
C	yeah
B	few years later Brickweave doesn't work
A	cobbles so that
A	cars can
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and if you take you know then if you take about what they've done round the Forum
C	they did didn't they
B	because they were too soft
C	yeah
A	oh really?
B	and they were all
C	yeah
A	no
C	oh dear
A	mm
C	well they used used to be a time where they used to have to get rid of their money pot before the end of April didn't they
B	mm
C	otherwise they wouldn't get it allocated again
B	yeah
C	the next year
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	Cos you can't do that in schools
A	mm
B	where I am at the moment I still think I was telling you where I am at the moment they have kept their budget in credit
C	yeah
A	right
B	right
A	mm
B	want to retire
A	right
B	alright? But they want to go maybe a year early or two years earlier
A	mm
B	but because the school keeps its budget on line they can't make them retire
A	oh
B	if the school was in a deficit budget and they needed to get rid of these members of staff then they would get help on
A	they'd get help
B	yeah
C	getting rid of
B	getting rid of
A	they could
B	no
A	no?
C	that's pathetic ain't it
A	how weird
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	well that's the situation
A	yeah
B	no
A	on any sort of benefits
C	no
B	er
A	anyone who's got any savings then er
B	he was at
A	lose out
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	now I don't know how far it will go
C	yeah
B	and it was saying that
C	yeah
A	mm
B	you've got some accountability
C	yeah
B	who are the academies accountable to?
A	mm
C	well that's true
B	are are they accountable to the government?
A	mm
B	because the government have allowed them to become academies
C	academies
B	or are they accountable to their sponsors?
A	right
B	which isn't the government
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	Cos the council has got nothing to do with them any more
B	nothing to do with them
C	nothing at all to do with them
B	nothing to do
C	that is  that is  a thought that is ain't it
B	and you you kind of think that you know here's a person that is working for an academy
C	yeah
B	they don't care
A	mm
B	and what they're saying is it's all because the er predecessor school had a deficit budget
C	no
B	because it was wiped clean on the thirty-first of August
A	right
B	when it became an academy
A	mm
B	county
C	yeah
B	so they all got a little bit less to cover that budget
A	mm
C	well
B	you know
A	tut
B	which
A	mm
B	you know where that's gonna lead to? That's gonna lead to saying
A	yeah
B	we've gotta cut some more staff
C	well yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	er the great teacher pit
B	oh well er
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and some will end up with nervous breakdowns
C	yeah
B	and some people will will move on to doing something else
A	mm
B	and they'll keep the costs down by having lots of NQT teachers in for three or four years where they don't have to
A	mm
B	pay them a certain amount of money
C	yeah
A	or parents doing some bit of voluntary work to help out
B	yeah
A	mm
C	do they still use parents in academies? Or not?
B	no
C	no
A	mm
B	no
C	they only use them in
B	in the little schools
A	mm
B	they try and keep parents out
C	yeah
B	or they mm
A	yeah
B	try and tell them things which are not going on
C	yeah
A	Don't need parents in schools
C	no
A	mm
B	you don't want  you don't want  people who care in schools in academies
A	mm
C	well that's right
B	everybody's
A	no
B	quick to moan
C	yeah
A	mm
B	to
A	well
C	I mean
B	mm
C	and people that
B	it's a trust isn't it
C	it's a trust
A	yeah
B	it's one
C	I don't know
A	mm
B	but isn't but that's what the doctors are arguing about
C	well that's er right
B	that shouldn't it shouldn't be they shouldn't have that responsibility
C	no
B	but if you put people that are managers in all they do is want to cut back things and
B	save the money
A	mm
C	of course they do
B	mm
C	but I mean the matrons in hospital used to keep keep the wards running didn't they
B	if we can get you home then that's the best isn't it
C	I mean you used to go to the maternity hospital and have the baby and stay in for er until they were thought they were okay to go home
B	twenty-four hours isn't it
C	twenty-four hour turn-over
A	mm
C	and they still reckon they haven't got any money
B	mm
C	you know
B	they they wanna cut back on all the good things
C	mm
B	that's what they that's what they're doing in education
C	yeah
B	but it's gonna have a knock-on effect on what pupils choose
C	has she's picked her
