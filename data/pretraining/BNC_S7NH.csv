A	did you sleep alright?
B	it is chilly isn't it?
A	mm
B	well I woke up early and I I did drop off again so
A	mm
B	but it is annoying to do that
A	no
B	well hopefully
A	no
B	anyway
A	well it did say it was going to rain on Tuesday
B	yeah
A	so erm are any of the groups you're in organising protests around the Jubilee or the Olympics or anything? Cos the unions have threatened to disrupt the Olympics haven't they? No
B	not that I'm aware of
A	I can't I thought it was someone from who was a a union member but anyway he erm he was speaking and I think it was when the tube drivers were threatening to strike and he was saying
B	mm
A	but he was saying you know the the way to get people's attention would be to strike or to protest during the Olympics
B	well clearly the authorities are really worried about a terrorist attack
A	yeah
B	oh my God
B	mhm
A	working in the counterterrorism department erm mainly covering the Olympics
B	oh dear
A	mhm
A	I'm so bored with the Olympics
B	well there there is that but we just need to get out of the Middle East
A	oh I see what you mean yeah
B	oh dear
B	yeah
A	does she?
B	mm
B	I think she's so tired by the end of the day
A	mm
B	cycling home is a real strain
A	mm
B	and obviously
A	no
B	but she's she comes home absolutely exhausted
A	mm
B	Cos she's just  she's just  standing all day
A	mm
B	running up and down stairs all day
A	I've done it
B	yeah
A	and it is exhausting
B	it is very very tiring yeah
A	well I was thinking about this yesterday
B	to be as tired as she gets yeah
A	at her age
B	mm
A	I suppose though
B	she didn't go out that much though
A	no but she hasn't really had the opportunity to do it here
B	oh absolutely
A	she would just go out
B	mm
A	mhm
B	she always did need a lot of sleep though didn't she?
A	yeah
B	I mean as a kid you did but even up to her teenage years when she was at school and college and whatever she still needed about ten hours sleep a night
A	mm
B	and people used to joke about it
A	yeah but as we've said before she's not very good at putting on a front for people is she
B	mm
A	I do try
B	mm
A	I feel like I have a
B	is the house very noisy at the weekend then?
A	no I just wake up and I can't go back to sleep and then you know they do but they do get up early
B	you're aware of them yeah
B	mm
A	every other weekend she and
B	oh right
A	so it's not ideal but it does do feel good
B	I suppose you're at the front
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and all the noisy neighbours
B	oh dear
A	I think there's like erm a training
B	mm
A	it's really annoying
B	oh lovely
A	mm
B	mhm
A	and then Thursday I think  doesn't get in until the afternoon
B	right
A	she's got the day off but she's got a few things to do so
B	mhm
A	she won't get here until about three or four o'clock in the afternoon so that's really nice
B	mm
A	and I think she'll probably just stay till Friday because she's got family stuff on
B	yeah
A	and then I've got Saturday Sunday Monday just to catch up with sleep and potter about
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	right
B	Cos I never used to be able to do that
A	no I can't do that
B	but it obviously didn't help you to do that
A	no I just lay there for about forty minutes
B	maybe take two then
A	yeah
B	I mean I think it's fine to take two
A	mm
B	to start with one
A	ease yourself in yeah
B	you take two and just buy a packet and have it
A	mm
B	well it is your body clock
A	mm
B	and he was always tired and complaining and I just think for God's sake just sleep
A	yeah I mean that's it
B	he would never lie there reading or try and go back to sleep
A	I mean I do lay in bed and I I think that's you know at least you can do that
B	yeah absolutely
A	but I suppose if you know I used to remember getting up early and watching cartoons and stuff and he'd come down but I suppose because we were up even if we were being quiet
B	he was awake anyway
A	yeah I know well it's not that we woke him up but I suppose he thought well if the kids are up I might as well get up
B	he wanted a
A	yeah but if you think that
B	mm
A	have you know make the most of of the day
B	mm
A	whereas
B	mm
A	the same
B	mm
A	it's really big
B	mm
A	Cos they weren't going to drain it
B	hello
A	he's sleepy
B	that was a fed up sigh
A	mm I've got toothache as well
B	oh
A	well it's this one at the moment
B	mm
A	and I've got to get my
B	and it's all okay?
A	my six month coming up
B	is there room for it?
A	well I don't know
B	mhm
A	erm he might say take them out
B	I would imagine
A	is pretty serious and if they're going to do all of them
B	mm
A	I can feel
B	it is it's very painful
A	did you have all four out?
B	no three
A	three
B	it was after I'd had one of you
A	oh right
B	and they just
A	I thought that's what it what you mean general? Oh right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I was terrified at at having them out cos it was it they're huge things and it it was unbelievably painful
A	really?
B	mm
A	what afterwards?
B	very painful
A	mm Jesus
B	a couple of days
A	yeah but only childbirth
B	oh no no there's  It's just very painful cos anything  in your  in your head hurts very much
A	yeah
B	headaches hurt
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	well yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah it is painful
B	go and see
A	mm
B	well no you said you've got your
A	mm in mid April I think
B	well that's not too far away
A	no
B	come on then
B	I know you want to come up here
A	mm
B	and he sits on the edge with his feet down the hole
B	it's not the most comfortable place
A	animals do surprise you where they can sleep though
B	oh yeah
A	no
B	well we had both of them at
A	no we didn't
B	yeah
A	oh yeah we did actually
B	mm
A	he likes the pink cushion doesn't he?
B	he likes the  he likes the  cushion
A	mm
B	we don't like lying completely flat do we?
A	no
B	aw you're very cute
A	yeah he is a good choice
B	very good nature
A	and he doesn't sit on your lap
A	which is nice
B	it's good for you isn't it?
A	it's good for me
B	I like it he he likes to lie on his back along my leg like that
A	mm
B	and just that' that's as close as he's comfortable with
A	mm
B	although he's settled ages ago
A	to a degree
B	mm
A	because you could abuse a dog to such a degree because it will always love you
B	absolutely
A	Cos it's not in its nature to understand that
B	no
A	but a cat will leave you if it finds a better deal
B	mm
A	but yeah I think he he seems very settled
B	Oscar won't will you? He does
A	I'm sure that's what
B	mm
A	he kept running away
B	he's fine
A	doesn't he try and jump through that erm fan window?
B	no it's too high
A	but he can get out of the bedroom ones can't he
B	yeah it's because there's a ledge
A	yeah it's not quite as big a distance
B	yeah
A	I mean from the
B	erm we haven't opened it because when it's been nice we've had the door open
A	mm mm
B	so we haven't just had that as it is today
A	yeah
B	yeah we'll put it back in my room today
A	that forget-me-not's everywhere isn't it
B	yeah
A	I mean the flowers are nice
B	I mean I don't  I don't  mind some but there are too many
A	it flowers early in the year then
B	yeah
A	Cos it's that
B	oh no you mean these?
A	the little blue ones at the bottom
B	these well they're roses they're violets
A	yeah but they're by the buddleia as well
B	they are
A	mm
B	erm but that's fine cos they're only little
A	oh yeah
B	and that will taken over
B	I wish I had some money
A	I know
B	I'm going to have to do it but I can only do it bit by bit
A	how expensive is it to buy the panels?
B	well individually it doesn't seem like much it's just you need so many of them
A	and how much are they on average? Yeah
B	oh God no about three or four
A	Jesus
B	yeah
A	so if you get the plans out for the house
B	well I mean it we could just measure it
A	measure it
B	pace it out or something
A	blimey
B	I'm definitely going to do the bit by the house because I want some privacy from next door
A	mm
B	it's not
A	ugly plants
B	A lot
A	Ivy
B	well holly is nice but it it the guy who came and trimmed it last summer said oh I'll leave the holly  cos it's  cos it's nice
A	mm
B	fine yeah it is nice
A	mm
B	if it's just left a holly tree will grow I don't know sixty feet or more
A	mm
B	I mean it is it's very it'll grow into a very big tree
A	yeah
B	that's why you have to be careful with it
A	mm
B	and there's a small one growing
A	I wonder if it's worth speaking to the tenants next door just saying can you have a word with the landlady to see if it's okay if we chop back the some wilderness
B	erm they paid erm to have this guy do it last year to to to to cut it so that the level wasn't blocking my light because that is an issue between neighbours
A	mm
B	blocking of light is something that's kind of I mean these things are not enshrined in law  but it's  but it's not you're not supposed to do that
A	mm
B	you're not supposed to block each other's light
A	mm
B	erm so I think they were told you know you're going to have to do this
A	yeah
B	of emphasis on on privacy
A	well given that everybody lives on each other's doorsteps now you'd think this would be written into the you know law
B	I know
A	no and that's the problem
B	everywhere is rented out
A	mm
B	if you've  if you've  if you're renting somewhere and it's got a garden you're supposed to keep it tidy which basically means you cut the grass
A	no no
B	mm
A	but really there's nothing like that
B	no
A	they've got a couple of little
A	there's that
B	yeah
A	erm and that's about it really
B	mm
A	yeah we've got them all down that side by the conservatory on your right
B	oh I'm I know the kind of thing that people
A	as a shield yeah
B	right
A	but that's probably because that's
B	yeah
A	so that
B	yeah
A	erm and it's the landlord next door who he rents it out to students who's who's got that chain link fence which would have been donkeys years old
B	yeah
A	and the bedstead
B	yeah
A	whether the landlord put the bedstead in or whether some tenants thought it would be really funny to put it in I don't know but even though either one would surprise me
A	given that the landlord has left a a used toilet in their front garden for six months
B	excellent
A	er but the
B	no
A	if I lived there I'd be horrified
B	well I know but students don't care
A	it must be
B	mm
A	I mean our house is falling down but at least we keep it clean on the inside
B	yeah
A	I mean the bathroom needs gutting
B	mm
A	they've obviously used like a non water resistant one
B	yeah
A	erm and it's I mean the cleaner that comes once a week
B	mm
A	Don't think she has anything
B	mm
A	she hasn't cleaned the bath
B	really?
A	she's she's supposed to hoover around the landing and the stairs and the hall
B	mm
A	and she's supposed to mop the floor
B	mm
A	it's really bad
B	mm
A	everyone's pretty good generally
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	which I think everyone's getting a bit annoyed with and she's so so heavy footed
B	mm
A	are you going to paint the fence all one colour? Your fence
B	what? I'm not particularly bothered
A	it's not an issue
B	no not really
A	you're going to need to put the the the stuff like the resin stuff on the wood
B	mm
A	no I mean on on yours
B	oh on this?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I mean is that why it's wearing away in places?
B	yeah because it it it wears off and you need to go over it again and you're supposed to do it
A	I love that smell
B	well less than one
A	mm
A	mm you can definitely see the red coming through
B	yeah it's it's so it's just so strong that stuff
A	mm
B	and  you can't  you can't paint it a lighter colour
A	mm
B	it's it's fine don't worry
A	I think I need some drugs
B	what kind?
A	brain
B	you're just tired
A	and my tooth is hurting a lot now
B	well I can help with that
A	how are your legs today?
B	oh they're fine
A	how's your tummy?
B	it's okay
B	yes
A	are you alright?
B	I'm alright
A	have you been listening to the new erm any more Glen Gould?
B	no I haven't
A	I like the collection he's got though
B	it is
A	mm
A	my boss at work
B	and he's got it?
A	no we don't think so but he's probably going to get it as it's a good time
B	mm
A	and he was working seventy hour weeks
B	mm
A	you have to sign a disclaimer to say I'll work whatever hours you need me to
B	seventy hours
A	he would leave at eight AM and come home at one AM
B	that's ridiculous
A	he would leave on a Wednesday and
B	yeah
A	and he would just
B	mm
A	but he's just started working at the colleges so it's Monday to Friday
B	mm
A	Seven till two
B	mm
A	it's so good
B	yeah
A	it's really really good but erm they don't know where she's got this from
B	it it is
A	it's the same virus yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so that's weird
A	so it's very weird
B	very odd the way that's happened
A	he it could be he does go to crèche a couple of days or one day a week maybe
B	or she's perhaps she's she's picked it up from one of the children then
A	exactly yeah
B	yeah
A	so bless her
B	mm
A	she works from home Thursdays and Fridays anyway but she'll be off this week and off for next week
B	mm
A	Cos obviously
B	Good
A	no
B	mm
A	everything is rush rush rush
B	mm
A	you don't really have time to sit and think you just have to push on through
B	mm
A	because I've got ten projects now that I'm looking after
B	wow
A	yeah erm there's and each one of them will have a different editor erm a different designer working on it
B	mm
A	they're all a different
B	mm
A	they're all
B	mm
A	which is the list that I look after in January because that's when the schools buy the books
B	mm
A	so that means all of the courses have to come out together
B	right okay yeah
A	and at the moment they're capitalising on a  on a  segment of the market that no-one else publishes for
B	mm
A	which is called the For Schools market so it's you might have an adult version of this exam level because this is the kids version so they've gone absolutely mental
B	mm
A	basically just capitalising on the fact that they've got you know market ownership there
B	mm
A	so everything is the For Schools version of everything now and what ESOL do is they update the exams
B	mm
A	but next year they're going to revise it and it's going to be released in twenty-fifteen so we might publish a book when everything is being published for January twenty thirteen
B	mm
A	but we're going to have to revise it almost immediately because the next version
B	mm
A	which means the authors have to be
B	mm
A	so we're working backwards from January fifteen
B	mm
A	completely ridiculous
B	mm
A	it just makes you feel like well you know you're never actually going to rest
B	mm
A	you're sort of flooding the market with with its own competition
B	well you are
A	because the exam is being revised
B	Will that have to be? Okay
A	but we don't know
B	oh God
A	well more than the bare bones
B	for God's sake why would you need to constantly
A	er it's almost like they're just creating work for themselves for the sake of it
B	no you wonder
A	you know if it's been perfectly good up till this point why do they need to keep revising it? I don't know
B	no
A	so
B	I suppose it erm
B	I suppose erm er what am I trying to say?
A	well if you thinking about publishing a book
B	yeah
A	well yeah it's pretty
B	yeah yeah
A	if you've got something that's not a massive seller
B	mm
A	it was last published in twenty
B	mm
A	it was in Quark rather than InDesign
B	oh right
A	so you've got to get all the old files from
B	mm
A	but basically we're changing eighty percent of the content
B	mm
A	so it's it's it's massive
B	it is isn't it
A	and then you've got things like for that you've got two business exams and they publish a student's book for each in this project
B	mm
A	so you've got one for Business English it's called and then one for Business
B	mm
A	we've got two exams
B	mm
A	you've also got accompanying audio for the student's book
B	mm
A	but there's also also authentic recordings so like this
B	mm
A	it's it's that that makes your job quite interesting because because that's what I have to do
B	that is a lot of work though isn't it
A	er and with the right people at the right time and everything is in place
B	mm
A	massive headache but yeah
B	but you're enjoying it
A	yeah because it's it's it's really challenging and no two days are the same really so
B	well that's what you want
A	that is what you want
B	than be doing the same thing over and over
A	yeah definitely
B	yeah good
A	I mean I I think
B	mm
A	we all worked in
B	has she settled in quite well has she?
A	she has and she and
B	yeah
A	erm and she already worked in the department before so you know we've met for a coffee when she was saying she was going to apply for the job but I said that she'd be great cos I know she'd be good at that
B	mm
A	erm but it's one of those jobs that you probably won't ever get a good idea of it until you start
B	mm
A	whereas I think with production I knew what I was letting myself in for
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well it was a good first step wasn't it
A	it was a good first step
B	it all worked out really well
A	it was a good entry level job
B	yeah
A	and
B	fantastic
A	yeah well I wrote back and said that's you know that's really sweet and you know I'm really touched but I erm I just hope I don't
B	mm
A	you never know
B	mm
A	you know it's all very well you you working at the top of your level when there's no money to progress
B	I know
A	and you know that the people in your department would like to promote you but there's just no money so
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	I think
B	mm
A	well she said  she knew  she knew it was going to be hard because obviously her her husband's here
B	mm
A	she said they skype everyday but and she's got a miniature
B	no but
A	yeah
B	mm
A	just not or they never they never wanted to be
B	I suppose when she's back you'll feel less pressured won't you?
A	erm well yeah cos I'm I'm doing two of her projects
B	mm
A	and even though she's supposed to
B	and when is she back?
A	June
B	blimey you've got a long stretch of being on your own then
A	I've got all of April and all of May
B	gosh
A	it's three months
B	yeah
A	that's I mean that's how much maternity leave they get
B	mm
A	so it is quite a long stretch
B	mm
A	erm it's fine
B	mm
A	I mean that's the thing
B	mm
A	they're not here
B	well whenever you do have a problem go to somebody because don't
A	yeah
B	I mean you know they are you know they have the position that they do erm
A	yeah and actually they are most of them are at that position because they're a line manager
B	I think  I think  don't don't worry about going to them and thinking they're busy
A	no no I'm I'm generally fine I mean it I've been doing it for three months now so
B	mm
A	no
B	yeah yeah it must be
A	Cos I started in November
B	yeah
A	so day to day you know I'm I'm getting a handle on things
B	mm
A	and the good thing is because we have so many new systems all learning all the time so that was the hardest thing about starting in November was because it
B	mm
A	whereas I think the others have had a lot longer to be working the old system and they're finding it a bit difficult to move across so
B	mm
A	for example yesterday I spent time with one of the seniors showing them how to use the new scheduling system
B	mm
A	and that was quite nice because it was quite nice to be able to help rather than being the one that's helped
B	mm
A	so it's alright
B	mm
A	and it is a good team
B	Good
A	it's sink or swim
B	mm
A	you going to have a lot of work
B	mm
A	and it's all going to have to come out at the same time
B	well I think you do thrive on that
A	yeah
B	well you certainly seem to you you know you
A	I don't want to be bored
B	it's a  it's a  really pleasant surprise to see you do this
A	yeah I mean who would have thought it? But it definitely brings out the best in people
B	the time that I first saw it was when you were doing
A	doing my MA yeah
B	you so loved doing it and getting on with it so even even the hassles about being there were were nothing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well I think it was then that I realised that this is  this is  what you
A	I think that was a turning point
B	you know given the right  given the right  subject or or world that you were in you know you absolutely thrived on it and you are
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well certainly once I'd latched onto it or when I started the course it really felt like yeah this is it
B	mm
A	and it's probably felt like that ever since
B	but as you say I mean this is somebody who
A	I didn't really like academic work
B	when  when you  when you had a project from school
B	yeah
A	and I think that's the thing
B	mm
A	as opposed to a necessarily a real choice to go
B	no no it absolutely wasn't
A	and er that was apparent
B	yeah
A	yeah I think that was the difference
B	yeah
A	erm whereas I think I just you know with U E A
B	mm
A	and I hadn't really engaged with any of it other than well erm I should go to uni it sounds good
B	well no I mean you you you said you wanted to do film
A	yeah but do you remember I started doing cultural studies?
B	yeah
A	and I think that was your drive
B	because because no
A	yeah yeah
B	and it seemed like
A	mm
B	mm
A	I wouldn't go
B	had you worked saved travelled that at the end of it you wouldn't have gone to uni
A	mm
B	and I was  I was I was  worried that that would happen to you
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah you might have yeah
A	I would be finishing my MA now
B	mm
A	so erm so yeah I'd be well behind
B	I know but you've done all of the stuff that you have
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I think so
B	well you obviously are
A	mm
B	mm
A	so it's funny
B	you you do
A	I'm very different to how I was when I was a teen
B	yeah
A	I still do have a confidence issues to a degree but at the same time I'm much more self assured obviously which is what's supposed to happen
B	you are
A	you are supposed to be more self assured when you're older but
B	I know but it doesn't always happen
A	it doesn't necessarily happen
B	no it doesn't
A	and everyone has you know issues about themselves
B	and you're very clear about what you want whereas when you were a teenager you you didn't know
A	mm
B	and you didn't put yourself out at all
A	no
B	whereas now you do
A	well I suppose you know it's it's meeting people it's doing things that test who you are as a person and
B	yeah
A	if you I suppose in every situation
B	you have pushed yourself
A	yeah
B	instead of thinking oh I'd really like to do that but I never could
A	mm
B	you absolutely have
A	yeah
B	and that's the difference because a teenager would have said I'd like to do that but that's not going to happen
A	well I lived in a safety net
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it made you think you could do anything and you did
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's not until you go to uni and you meet people from all walks of life and all different backgrounds and you all think differently and you all have different challenges and they challenge your perception of yourself and the world and anything that you take for granted and it's not until you keep meeting new people and I mean it sounds really tripe but it's true
B	exactly
A	I think that and that's probably why I'm more bolshy than
B	mm
A	she doesn't feel she's able to stand up to these people and I think because I started off in my working life doing that saying actually no you're not going to take advantage
B	mm
A	you know I did
B	they did yeah
A	and that was my first working experience whereas
B	it wasn't her first job
A	what was her first job?
B	although that was the one that she really liked
A	oh that's right
B	because she hated it
A	yeah fair enough
B	it was a horrible place to work
A	but
B	yeah
A	her bosses were I think you know bosses as bosses are but no-one took advantage
B	no
A	and I think at that age because I'd had to stand up to
B	mm
A	and at that point I think I thought well actually you can't can't walk over people and I don't know whether naturally we're different because I wouldn't allow it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like I accidentally offended one of my colleagues the other day
B	mm
A	and er I was saying I think because I wasn't really quality controlling what was coming out
A	and I'd said oh I I think people who believe in Jesus are just a bit silly like it won't
B	mm
A	our director of our financial director I found out the other day is a a is very religious and he goes to church every week and it's fine
B	mm
A	but by saying this I I didn't realise I was offending Tom who is quite religious and I didn't know this and obviously why would I? It's not you know you don't need to shout about it
B	mm
A	but I wasn't really thinking and obviously I'm entitled to my own opinion but  it is  it is quite offensive  if you  if you take it that way
B	of course
A	and then we were talking about the riots in London and he was getting really agitated and he was saying his cousin
B	mm
A	was er is in the police works for the Met and was part of the riot erm the riot troops that came out
B	mm
A	and he was saying I'm not being funny right but women you know why do they put them in these positions? And I said well she would have had training
B	mm
A	they wouldn't have let her go out if they thought that she couldn't you know look after herself and her other fellow officers
B	mm
A	and he was saying you know she's tiny
B	mm
A	and he necked his beer and was oh look sorry whatever
B	mm
A	and then a couple of days later
B	oh
A	but he didn't say anything to me
B	no he didn't no
A	he didn't challenge me
B	yeah
A	which is fine
B	or if not if if he
A	yeah
B	of course he is yeah
A	I wasn't saying they're stupid
B	no
A	erm that I find it strange
B	I think it's
A	it's not a logical thing
B	well it's it's not reason is it
A	I wasn't calling people who believe in religion stupid necessarily I was just saying that I can't marry the two ideas that if you are a logical person you would therefore believe in God
B	mm
A	yeah just leave it alone
B	yeah
A	so now he's
B	mm
A	I mean we didn't know each other that well before but it's quite
B	mm
A	I think if you're so he's but obviously he's not somebody I would really be friends with anyway because he's obviously got a bit of a women issue there
B	mm
A	erm but er yeah it was a bit strange
B	no
A	but I think going back to what we were saying I think that's probably because I do speak without thinking often and er
B	mm
A	I think I'm so convinced of my own opinions now that I'm not necessarily that bothered about other people's
A	maybe that's how I've always been I don't know
B	yeah
A	and I I'm aware of that
B	mm
A	bless you
B	oh dear
A	mm
B	but it also it helps you to crystallise your own ideas you know
A	mm
B	absolutely
A	mm
B	so the more you mix the more you talk
A	it's a good thing yeah
B	yeah
A	not necessarily shoot them down
B	but not
A	mm
B	I mean which is  which is  you know the other thing that can happen so
A	mm
B	but it  but it  helps
A	mm
B	the more we mix with you know all the differences that you know of opinion of culture of background the better for all of us I think
A	absolutely yeah
B	but I think that's the problem
A	mm
B	rather than welcoming it and and enjoying it
A	yeah
B	you know that's not what's required
A	mm
B	anyway
A	mm
B	because often it will confirm them as well
A	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
B	I mean you know you realise that actually yeah
A	I think that's right yeah
B	but we do get very stuck in our ways of thinking
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	erm no other views
A	mm
B	the discussion of ideas the the the the free flow of ideas between people is is what has made us and and what will continue to make us a good society
A	mm
B	well that was I mean that just reminds me of mum because it was it's like she decided this is what she believed and that was that and she wasn't interested in anything
A	mm
B	mm
A	erm no dear that's not what we think this is what we think
B	because it's it's it's their sense of superiority
A	mm
B	and it's it's a  it's a  putting down of erm you know other classes other cultures as as being inferior to theirs
A	mm
B	and and not allowing anything to challenge that because if you challenge that you will see weaknesses in that and you have to accept other things as being important or right
A	mm
B	and they you know it's it's it's not wanting to allow that to happen I think
A	yeah
B	so you cling on to your view and you don't  you don't  allow any anything to challenge that
A	yeah
B	I don't think you're closed
A	I don't think I'm closed I think I'm
B	I think you just I think you know at having got to the age that you have and done the things that you've done I think you realise certain things are important and and you you're not shy about saying that
A	yeah I'm I'm aware of my own values and and my core values and what I think is important
B	well that's fine
A	yeah but I try not to  I try not to  judge too quickly but I guess we're all a bit guilty of that
B	well exactly we
A	mm
B	oh you're beating yourself up a bit this morning
A	no
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but it's a very important thing to
A	well I think people that don't have got something to hide from themselves haven't they because why don't they want to look inside
B	if people
A	it's yeah
B	and you might
A	might not like what you see
B	it it allows doubt
A	yeah
B	you can't allow doubt in because then it will upset that
B	I mean I I think that's a very  a very  good saying erm no let me get it right
A	oh that's interesting
B	I think that's that's because if you know you're right if you have no doubt at all knowing you are right
A	mm
B	erm Hitler knew he was right
A	mm
B	didn't he?
A	yeah absolutely
B	and Stalin
A	mm
B	these mad dictators they know they're right
A	mm
B	and they will do anything in the cause of that
A	yeah
B	that about which they know they are right
A	I mean I don't want to you know compare Blair to Hitler but Blair thought Blair knew he was right
B	no
A	mm
B	and Bush
A	mm
B	no
A	mm
B	and it makes them very dangerous because they're prepared to go to war because they are right
A	mm
B	so beware of anyone who knows that they're right
A	mm
A	yes indeedy
B	ah you're so cute
A	he looks pretty pleased with himself
B	he's very relaxed
A	is that your perfume on the book here still?
B	it is
A	mm
B	I don't wear it obviously everyday but I
A	mm
B	I
A	mm
B	oh thank you
A	oh I'm glad you had a nice time
B	it was a bit busy
A	I know but it was good that's for that reason
B	mm
A	it was nice that Steve could make it up as well it sort of put the icing on the cake
B	it was I mean it's the first time I've seen him on my birthday for years
A	yeah
B	and he
A	Good
B	he loves being around you lot so
A	does he?
B	yeah
A	I'm always wondering whether it just hard work
B	no he likes it
A	he was very good with
B	but erm he's kind of oo all these kids erm yes well it's nice being an uncle but I don't really know what to do with them all
A	can can you take them please?
B	but as soon as you all grew up erm you know
A	yeah
B	I think he would have done
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean at least they were sensible about it though
B	it is
A	not let's just have kids anyway
B	I know
A	yeah
B	and I know she did want them
A	well she's young enough but there's time
B	well
A	late thirties
B	yeah late thirties I think yeah
A	well
B	mm
A	first baby
B	I mean it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's the props
A	well it's that low drone that makes me think it's of it as a big plane
B	no I think it's when they're testing engines
A	yeah
B	it's not something flying
A	right okay
B	I think because it goes on and on
A	because the prop  the prop  planes make a sort of more sort of buzzing
B	yeah that's a different  that's a different  sound isn't it
A	is a different sound yeah
B	no it is an engine but it's a oh I don't know what what you call it anyway
A	mm
B	erm so is it going to be dry do you think?
A	I think so
B	just realised erm
A	your washing's still in the machine
B	I could hang the washing out because it would be
A	yeah I mean it
B	so I think I could so long as it's not damp
A	I don't know
B	it's greyer than it was yesterday
A	it's grey
B	it's even more grey than yesterday
A	I don't know what these mean
B	oh it's so nice when they say that
B	yeah
A	Good visibility
B	well that's really not very warm is it
A	no not when during the week it was nineteen
B	I know
A	I know so it's going to be wind
B	it is actually
A	just put them out this morning
B	yeah
A	then it's got a good sort of six hours till you'll have to bring it in
B	oh yeah yeah yeah I think I'll do that
A	tomorrow it'll have sunny intervals
B	slightly better then
A	it's April Fool's Day tomorrow
B	oh so it is
A	charge my phone
B	quite quickly yeah
A	well I think cos you don't use the background data do you
B	no I don't
A	which runs down the battery
B	no I don't check emails on it
A	yeah
B	wow
A	three pounds and two pounds
B	and they look nice together
A	well they look a bit weird
B	no they look nice
A	okay
A	okay
B	and I don't know why
A	yeah
B	she wanted to watch Strangers on a Train
A	is that Gregory Peck?
B	no it's not
A	it's Clark?
B	it's it's
A	Cary
B	it's one of those films erm
A	where you think it's someone famous and it's not
B	and it's not
A	mm
B	I mean I've seen it many times so I know I I can't think of
A	mm
B	erm I think both of them made films at the time but erm and it's a good film but I have seen it many times
A	yeah
B	erm but she slept through it
A	it's from a
B	oh no that's why she's
A	and it was referenced and we I couldn't tell you what it was
B	mm
A	the thing is there's there's
B	absolutely
A	it's like watching a play
B	and all Hitchcock films although you can tell they're Hitchcock
A	yeah
B	they are all different form each other
A	yeah well it's because he's making films for forty years
B	yeah
A	you know his early films were influenced by German cinema which is a bit weird
B	mm
A	which is why his early films are a bit peculiar
B	yeah
A	then he moves to Hollywood and makes Hollywood blockbusters and then he makes yeah some interesting arty films
B	yeah of course
A	Cos obviously he makes them for such a long time but naturally within that
B	yeah
A	I mean it's brilliant
B	I would think so
A	apart from The Birds
B	and different ones like like
A	yeah
B	I don't know whether
A	yeah but we we've
B	yeah
A	she'd watch that
B	but she's very odd about the things that she will and won't watch
A	yeah it's difficult to predict
B	I I can't predict
A	it's amazing what a small surface area you can get all four paws on
B	I know
A	mm
B	and actually and turn around on it as well
A	yeah
B	it's very strange I mean that you know they can do that
A	and he's sleeping
B	I mean and almost literally walk on a tightrope
A	yeah
B	it's so funny
A	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I don't like this not having any money
A	rubbish
B	it's absolute poo
A	mm
B	I'm not not going to look too far ahead I think that's the
A	probably for the best
B	it seems to work the best
A	well that's what the most people do
B	it's well yeah but you you do have to look a bit forward but not too much
A	well it's nice to have an idea of something
B	I mean I look forward to growing things and
A	yeah yeah
B	you know nice times sitting
A	mm
B	I enjoy things
A	yeah yeah I know
B	er I think  I think  I need to have people round more
A	yeah
B	in the summer
A	probably good
B	mm
A	mm
B	just come round
A	okay
B	any time
A	mm with our installation art
B	oh you can ignore that
A	mm
B	and a bikini
A	Cook me
B	you do
A	I'll just try and be a bit sensible
B	slap on the old er SPF
A	yeah yeah
B	and you'll be alright
A	actually that's a point I might go and dig that out of the garage cos it's in one of the boxes with my summer clothes
B	is it?
A	yeah I packed it away in the depths of winter because I thought I wouldn't need it
B	of course
A	yeah I'll go and dig it out a bit later
B	you'll want your summer clothes as well won't you
A	mm
B	mm
A	oh yeah yeah
B	mm
A	cotton dresses and things that really are just when it's hot
B	when it's very hot so
A	mm
B	yeah
A	sort of like three days a year that if you're in the UK you can wear them
B	mm
A	and I won't be having a summer holiday this year
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	you know they have  you know they have  the
B	oh my God
A	but there's a bank holiday so it means
B	yeah but you don't really want to be there though
A	well it
B	mm
A	was a friend of her sister's
B	oh
A	that was the night they met and I was there
B	ah
A	and we had a house party because her parents because it's a long weekend her parents bought a caravan on the coast
B	yeah
A	so I think I'd gone on the Saturday
B	mm
A	and was it in the party was a Friday night
B	mm
A	and on the Saturday we drove to the coast and that's when we went to
B	lovely
A	has got the same weekend off again this year so she said why don't you come over?
B	mm
A	twelfth
B	twelfth of July that rings a bell for me
A	mm
B	no
A	they thought it was like a big everyone would be celebrating and they didn't really understand all the troubles
B	americans
A	well I mean it is complicated
B	of course it is
A	er but yeah so I might go over then
B	mm
A	obviously no-one assumes it will be nice weather but erm in terms of sort of getting about and having little breaks
B	mm
A	so I've got next week the Jubilee week
B	mhm
A	and I think erm we might go
B	well when is the Jubilee week?
A	at the beginning of June
B	is it? I think so that's in June and the Olympics are July
A	end of July
B	Good grief
A	yeah
B	no
A	mm
B	yeah she's catching up on Victoria
A	mm
B	Cos how long cos? Wait a minute I do know
A	I don't know when she was crowned but she died in nineteen O one
B	that's right
A	really?
B	yeah sixty-four
A	and she is the longest serving monarch?
B	yeah
A	well if she's going to be like her mum then yeah
B	mm
A	she could live for another twenty years
B	she could
B	well she was  she was  young
A	was she twenty? So she probably eighty
B	whereas Victoria was a  was a  I think she was actually a teenager wasn't she? About eighteen or something when she became queen?
A	yeah yeah
B	erm I I think she was born I I erm I think she was born in twenty-six because mum was born in thirty-six and I just remember
A	okay
B	twenty years before
A	eighty-six
B	God
A	well she must be
B	yeah cos the Duke's ninety isn't he
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	he just you know his body was giving up on him
B	mm
A	so it happens but you'd think that by the time you get to ninety you're brain it would just be mush
B	mm
A	it depends how active you keep it I suppose
B	they do yeah
A	it's not like he'd be using his brain an awful lot
A	if he ever did
B	oh
A	has he been fed?
B	yes
B	what's he meowing for? Oh
A	so she's eighty-six
B	yeah
A	so she's potentially she's got another sixteen years
B	yes? What are you complaining about? What are you complaining about? Are there birds out there?
A	at which point Charles
B	he's a year younger I think
A	right so in which case this year he's fifty-sixty-four
B	yeah
A	erm and in sixteen years he'd be
A	he'd be eighty so he might be senile
B	yeah
A	in which case maybe it would go
B	and people have often said that
A	mm
B	you know the queen the queen's obviously going to live a very long time and he might never be king and wouldn't it be better just to give it to William?
A	he's held out for
B	but he wouldn't be king for very long
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	what do you do with your life?
A	mm
B	and I think that's always been his frustration
A	well I suppose but you can still you know the princes certainly er are busy enough and they go out their
B	he's certainly tried to do things
A	I mean they're out and about meeting people
B	oh that's what Charles has always done
A	he's quite into the all green way of life as well isn't he
B	he has been
A	he formed the Princes Trust
B	he did
A	mm
B	and I think he does done
B	erm his house is it Highgrove? I think that's what it's called
A	the one on The Mall?
B	highgrove House
A	well there's one that belongs to him ext to the palace isn't there?
B	Clarence House
A	Clarence House yeah
B	yeah I think I think they've got that as well maybe
A	that's his isn't it?
B	anyway he turned it into a a you know a completely kind of sustainable house
A	really?
B	erm the waste systems
A	mm
B	I mean and there was a big programme about all of that
A	wow
B	and I thought well that's really good
A	oh absolutely
B	but at least he's doing so fair enough
A	it's a good model for
B	and that was a big project for a long time
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I think I remember reading in the paper that Blair at the time was quite would get frustrated with him because he would try and get involved in politics and it's all like that's a bit of  bit of  a no no in this day and age but to have someone take an interest in the monarchy is is important I think you know they are supposed to be the head of our  of our  country whether that's in name only which it essentially is
B	mm
A	but they should be
B	mm
A	well absolutely and and there's reasons for that I mean look at our history but still if you're going to have a monarchy have them involved or don't have one
B	mm
A	this whole pretence it's very very strange
B	it is pretence yeah
A	this black rod knocking on the House of Commons and
B	I know and that's why it gets frustrating because you think well what are we paying them to do? And it's it's billions
A	well
B	you know
A	oh absolutely
B	I think that's it
A	it's it's historic you know
B	I I don't know what it is
A	it's nice
B	it has no no real value
A	tourism is the value
B	but but oh well that's what people say I mean I don't know
A	well look at the wedding last year
B	but why do they? It doesn't make any sense
A	they love it
B	it is weird isn't it?
A	I mean if you look at countries that are obsessed with British culture
B	it's so strange isn't it
A	it's a big it's big money spinner for the UK
B	I suppose that's that's how
A	and that's part of the reason for having the Olympics here
B	yeah yeah
A	obviously by September they'll be out of work but at a time when there are few jobs then
B	yeah
A	I don't understand it
B	but it's I think more than that it's it's the money that's being poured into an area of London that that needed it but it's not the people who actually live there that will benefit from it
A	mm
B	yeah and that's what they're that's what's happening
A	it will drive people out into into the slums because that's the area that people could afford to live in
B	and it's and and the the new building  the new building  is is expensive building so
A	it's not affordable housing
B	no
B	just seems very wrong
A	mm
B	but it was like you know the rich have always lived in the West and then the North and then the South and now they're moving into the East of London so what area of London is there for ordinary working class people to live in?
A	yeah
A	it does look like it's going to rain doesn't it?
B	it's windy as well
A	and that's quite a grey cloud coming over
B	it is
A	I mean we might we're usually just on the edge of it aren't we?
B	we are
A	I mean it will be good
B	it does
A	it's very dry
B	Richard always goes ah you're always saying this
A	mm
B	it does dry out and and we need it
B	in the summer we're going to need it
B	well everything needs water
A	I know I know I know but in terms of whether you keeps the roses alive or whether you keep the veg alive
B	mm
A	did you say that there are they quite temperamental? The roses?
B	no
A	once they're in they're okay
B	yeah
A	no
A	mm
B	I mean these these have only right these four have been in two years now
A	mm
B	but I mean every summer I've been able to water it as much as I liked
A	yeah
B	and the roses don't like being very dry
A	it's difficult isn't it because they're they're the ones that need all the sun
B	yeah
A	so they would dry out
B	mm
A	I wonder what they're going to do the botanics?
