A	what's that?
B	a foldy up bed
A	a
B	have you never seen a camp bed?
A	no is it a zed bed?
B	I don't know possibly I think grandma's got one
A	I've seen a
B	no this isn't inflatable
A	you blow it up with your feet
B	a foot pump?
A	sort of yeah
B	built in foot pump yeah
A	oh I don't know whether it were built in or not
B	where where did she get it from?
A	she's just always had it
B	oh well I'll borrow hers
A	she was putting it out in
B	where
A	she was putting it out for
B	when?
A	a few months weeks ago
B	oh well I'll just borrow it I didn't know she had one
A	oh yeah she's got a blow-up bed
B	does it take up much room I mean when it's not inflated?
A	when it's inflated it does yeah
B	no if I put it in the car to take with us
A	oh you won't get it in the car if it's inflated
B	no if it's deflated
A	can you deflate them as well?
B	well how do you what did it look like before she blew it up?
A	I don't know it was sort of flat it was the same shape but flat
B	they fold up
A	do they? oh
B	well where do you think it is now?
A	that's a good point
B	did you think once it was inflated you couldn't deflate it?
A	well I don't well well well I didn't but I
B	it's just a valve er and you just
A	yeah
B	squash all the air out
A	oh yeah that's good isn't it is? it like a mac in a pack? a cag in a bag?
B	oh
A	all you know for people who go camping?
B	yeah
A	oh no that would be a camp bed won't it?
B	no people don't take those any more
A	well why are they called camping beds then?
B	well maybe they used to be
A	oh it's all very complicated to me isn't it?
A	foam rubber?
B	what do they take if they go camping?
A	what if you're allergic to rubber?
B	foam
A	in a bag?
B	don't you just roll it up with your
A	sleeping bag
B	sleeping bag?
A	yeah I like a sleeping bag they're great aren't they?
B	yeah
A	no you were the only person I've ever seen who's got a sleeping bag sheet
B	an inner sheet
A	oh they're marvellous
B	well that's cos I lent it out
A	marvellous
B	if someone else is using it I'd rather they went inside a sheet in the bag
A	like an envelope
B	cos you don't wash sleeping bags
A	like an
B	yeah
A	very good
B	at least I don't think you wash sleeping bags
A	well it would be hard wouldn't it?
B	I've never known anyone wash a sleeping bag
A	you'd fill up a washing machine with a sleeping bag wouldn't you?
B	well I bet they stink when you think of it if people are not washing them
A	I think
A	he looks more like Benny Graham
B	who's Benny?
A	the north eastern folk singer
B	oh I know who you mean anyway as I was saying
A	yeah
B	I'll borrow
A	yeah
B	and take that with a sleeping bag
A	yeah
B	that means you'll you will have to travel light
A	mummy
B	she will
A	will she?
B	yes
A	how do you know?
B	the only other thing I could do
A	she's got everything she's got flip-flops she's got
B	she might not have a spare bed
A	yeah but the flip-flop incident when you took my shoes away and we were left in the house
B	I know
A	with no shoes?
A	busking in sister
A	by the time we got to
B	oh the
A	I thought they might
B	that's bad
A	cos Hollande was meant to be a really good leader but he turned out to be one of the worst ones ever not socialist at all didn't he?
B	I thought he'd done alright I don't like these
A	no they said he's done really badly
B	I don't like Le Pen
A	Front National
B	oh that's sad
A	what's happened?
B	there was a man trying to rescue another man who'd fallen onto the tracks and the rescuer's been killed
A	what about happened to the man who was being rescued?
B	that's what I'm just gonna try and find out
A	no
B	the other the other one's critical
A	right
B	oh that's sad
A	a lot of disasters happening in the world nowadays aren't there?
B	well I think they probably always have but it's just
A	yeah
B	you know we get to hear about them
A	yeah
B	do you reckon?
A	you you like your little telephone don't you?
B	it's too small for me
A	do you want a bigger one?
A	yeah
B	I am tired
A	well you were
B	well that's the latest
A	you woke me up this morning and I was very sad I
B	well it's good you've got such good reactions I suppose
A	oh when you were telling me all about this music on the radio that turned out to be rubbish
A	that was disappointing wasn't it?
B	well they gave it such a build-up I
A	yeah
B	oh this is gonna be good
A	yeah
B	so
A	the
B	hey-ho
A	is nice though isn't it?
B	pardon?
A	it's a nice cinema though isn't it the
B	I love it
A	is that the one where you get
B	when shall when shall we go to
A	I don't know it's got is that the one with the upstairs café?
B	yeah but it think the Radio 4 news is coming from the downstairs one
A	oh the bar?
B	the bar come
A	oh can you? oh
B	she meets
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	that is interesting isn't it?
B	it's very interesting
A	very nice
B	er how long does it take to get to
A	oh not long
B	oh I yeah oh I know but it's still just
A	yeah
B	a straight run down
A	it'll only be about twenty minutes maybe that is a really
B	we could pop into
A	a real estimate
B	we could pop into erm
A	oh no I don't like that
B	why not?
A	it's a chain you know Simply Dutch
B	is it?
A	well they've got a branch in West Yorkshire I saw on Wikipedia
B	oh you mean there's two branches?
A	well there might be others as well
B	no I don't think so
A	well they've definitely got some others
B	how many?
A	well I don't know have a look
B	what what constitutes a chain?
A	er well they tend to
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	two shops is a chain?
A	I suppose it could be except Subway isn't a chain
B	yeah
A	you rent out the name from them to use
B	yeah like those toy shops they used to be franchises
A	oh Fundamental Fun yeah
B	yeah
A	a chain might be something to do with having shareholders
B	well what's
A	but then there's a
B	yeah what's a PLC?
A	public limited company which must mean it's public which means it must be
B	they publish their accounts
A	on the stock exchange
B	no
A	no?
B	well what's what's
A	they won't be
B	a partnership?
A	they're limited they're limited
B	a limited
A	a partnership yeah
B	limited company
A	yeah
B	so they don't have to publish their
A	and then they don't have shareholders
B	accounts
A	either I think a PLC is when you've got shareholders isn't it maybe
B	yeah I think it is
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure though
A	well unlimited is if you get into debt they can come and take away your assets to pay the debt but if you're limited the debt
B	that's right
A	is the company's not yours
B	yeah yeah
A	something like that yeah
B	yeah that's right
A	yeah that sounds
B	how did you know that?
A	I was talking to
B	well how would you work out this? Newcastle United have made nine million profit
A	yeah
B	right? this year
A	yeah
B	give or take
A	yeah
B	but the club's in debt for a hundred and twenty-nine million
A	okay
B	but that's Mike Ashley's loan to them
A	oh I see so the company
B	yeah but he's lent them a hundred and twenty-nine million but he owns the club
A	yeah
B	so how can he lend himself?
A	no he he lends the people who are in charge of the club that much he says
B	but he I thought he was in charge
A	no he owns it he's not he gives he gave it to the board and the managing director to spend
B	so he's he's lent them money?
A	yeah and they've got to pay him back
B	and they've made nineteen million which he'll get a big share of
A	yeah cos he owns it
B	and and he'll and he'll get his own money back
A	yeah
B	well he he's in a win-win situation isn't he?
B	yeah he does
A	what is it like nineteen percent now or something?
B	what else does he own?
A	Sports Direct dot com
B	what else?
A	Sports Direct
B	oh yeah but I thought you said something else
A	I just sung the theme tune
B	I don't like him
A	what happened to that
B	no
A	I saw at the
B	oh yeah
A	if I had a pound for every day somebody asks me that
B	she wasn't related
A	I would be as rich as him
B	she should do a family tree she might have been related
A	oh they can go and claim money back from him
B	Middlesbrough have lent Carlisle a defender
A	that's nice
A	I wouldn't mind if York go down I I don't really mind about York to be honest
B	oh poor York
A	yeah I know but
B	they're getting a big new stadium
A	that's for rugby league though isn't it as well?
B	and football yeah
A	York Knights yeah
B	yeah
A	I like the rugby league too
B	when erm when does the football season end the cricket season start?
A	the cricket season starts in April
B	do they overlap?
A	yeah quite a bit actually and they overlap at the other end
B	do they?
A	as well yeah
B	are all the football matches finished by the end of April?
A	oh no no
B	into May?
A	yeah and when's the FA Cup final? is that the end of May cos that's always a last thing isn't it?
B	I'm not sure yeah
A	the FA Cup final
B	but no doubt there'll be er euro qualifiers World Cup qualifiers or have they finished?
A	er no there will well World Cup was only in last year wasn't it?
B	what about that Qatar one?
A	so they won't have even started them yet
B	oh there's a Qatar Christmas one
A	Qatar World Cup?
B	it's isn't it er
A	I know it's like
B	do they not
A	yeah
B	get snow in Cancun?
A	no well actually somewhere no it's like having the Winter Olympics here cos it's
B	Cornwall
A	no no well even like Yorkshire
B	mm
A	or Cumbria where there's like enough mountains and stuff like in on paper it seems okay
B	oh like you'd get a ski jump and
A	but in practice it's not
B	but you couldn't do
A	but in practice you couldn't really could you? it's too hot
B	you'd struggle to get to ski jump in East Anglia maybe or the Fens
A	well yeah
A	I'm thinking more like the terrain's there but the weather
B	ah right
A	just sometimes is but sometimes isn't
B	what do you call those things there?
A	what things?
B	in the front of the car erm
A	Minions
B	Minion yeah
A	er I don't know what to think of them getting their own film I think it might be a bit overkill do you know what I mean?
B	a Minions film?
A	yeah they're getting their own but they're so good in Despicable Me I don't know whether
B	yeah they'll still make the profit won't they?
A	yeah but they might lose like popularity
B	that won't matter maybe it's just a
A	yeah
A	am I obese?
B	no
A	me and
B	why?
A	to get fatter
B	why? oh is that a joke?
B	only four out of three hundred and sixty-nine
A	well I don't know how they do those surveys
B	they surveyed nearly three thousand families
A	yeah but
A	is your child obese?
B	and they didn't reckon
A	listening? you wouldn't want to say yes if they were listening would you really if you're
B	well I think it's a ticky box thing isn't it?
A	yeah
B	they weight everyone in year six anyway
A	oh yeah that's fun
B	I have noticed that our
A	yes
B	our year sixes have never there's no maybe even one person overweight but this year the first time ever
A	really?
B	five
A	how many of them are Polish?
B	good question
A	or are more of those in the late the younger years?
B	four out of five actually are Polish now you mention it
A	gosh
B	they do have a sweet tooth
A	yeah
B	yeah fives though
A	yeah
B	rather than
A	will that be to do with the low economy
B	who knows
A	cheaper food required
B	to be honest I think people can't see it with their eyes because if you watch a television programme that was
A	yeah
B	set in the sixties and seventies it's noticeably
A	yeah
B	perceptions change
A	yeah
B	yeah well I'm just looking around here actually
A	well I don't know whether
B	people are quite thin just at the moment if you look round here
A	yeah
B	and when the army lot were in none of them were fat were they?
A	well yeah to be honest that is the army lot isn't it?
B	actually
A	have they?
B	yeah yeah
A	oh and I I didn't mean that I meant there's a lot of people at the drive-through
A	I was changing the subject
B	yeah but the ones who are
A	let's have a look
B	inside are not
A	oh oh
B	slightly yeah but
B	they have been they
