A	so I went and met
B	oh right
A	so that which I didn't know but so I was they're giving
A	and going I hadn't got anything for
B	a little bit awkward
A	yeah but oh no but she was laughing saying don't you dare don't worry
A	don't get anything and I was yeah yeah there so she'll obviously get something next week when she's not expecting it
B	yeah
A	but so we went to Clarks erm which is in the
B	yeah the one that is free for
A	is that what it was?
B	I think so
A	oh I don't know
B	I think it was that for a little while I
A	yeah well no we we went well I went in there and there was a wood bar across the door and it was only a few minutes to twelve so I started thinking I've got the wrong time they're on day or I knew I'd got the right day so I went back outside to wait for
B	yeah
A	but we sat outside there er it was absolutely beautiful looking over the river
B	mm
A	and there were swans on the river and there was actually a barge parked up next to the you know the the
B	yeah
A	there's actually a
B	yeah there were there was sometimes when we used to be there there was one there I think it used to be a regular one there that's
A	maybe it does holiday things or day trips or something
B	yeah maybe something don't know
A	mm yeah
B	not sure
A	but so so we
A	nearly and
B	mm
A	with a large glass of water because obviously they were going back to work
B	yeah
A	we were both er we're all driving
B	yeah
A	really nice
B	yeah no I didn't get didn't go outside much today I went out erm for a wander on my lunch and obviously then
A	mm
B	so I
A	so what was it was it a lesson this morning?
B	erm no that was just because I was just feeling rough with my tooth
A	oh right oh
B	no no no outside at work
A	oh right okay
B	on my lunch break
A	mm just as well our
B	yeah I wouldn't have been able to do it anyway because erm on the dos and don'ts it says that you're not allowed to do any strenuous activity anyway so I think they'd class
A	ice skating
B	yeah I think that would count as strenuous activity and exercise
A	yeah
B	so no I'm gonna go tomorrow night cos it'll be on then so
A	yeah
B	I'll do it then
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it's cos Rainbows hasn't started yet has it?
B	no it's Wednesday tomorrow anyway
A	oh yeah
A	today's Tuesday
B	yeah so no erm it'll be good I cos I I've got a lesson tomorrow morning
A	mm
B	so
A	so will you be alright tomorrow? is will that be a long a
B	yeah yeah yeah he says like on the day
A	oh that's alright then
B	in fact
A	well I think that was that was really good though
B	mm
A	your tooth
B	yeah I'm glad I did because it's a lot better now
A	so do you feel less wise now you have less wisdom teeth?
B	no
B	I always say a secret genius in the making so
A	you
B	I say
A	oh right
B	erm no it's good though it still feels weird
A	mm
B	cos
A	yeah
B	I'm glad it is it's so much more comfortable I can actually feel I've come back to me
A	mm
B	that's nice
A	so tell me what you do with the skating now
B	erm well we've got the we'll be starting work on the Christmas so er show soon cos it's we normally know by October what we're doing and so we should know if they're talking about like Cinderella or Mary Poppins or Jungle Book or something like that but
A	yeah
B	erm hopefully this year if it's a show it'll probably just be our lot so then we might get to do a bit more as well
A	how how long roughly?
B	I wouldn't say it would be that long like I think we'll know the date soon and then it just depends on when there's enough people to put in for a test cos they won't bring a
A	so they have to wait until they've got
B	yeah yeah
A	enough people
B	there was a fair few yeah erm lots of people do a number of different tests so people do like their elements and their freestyle and their field moves on the same day
A	so what's are they in a particular order that
B	erm
A	different levels in each type?
B	yeah you have different levels in each type so like it goes up to ten and then you have it in freestyle
A	so when?
B	once I've done level one
A	when you do the test thing then can when they come to test you could you be doing two or three different things is that what you normally do?
B	yeah you well you can either do it depends really what you've got ready for testing er my level twos aren't quite ready for testing yet so I'm not putting them in but I could very easily do level one and two in in in elements while I'm doing my level two and three and my level two in field moves but they're
A	mm
B	not quite polished enough yet that we're ready to put them in they're nearly there with some of them but there's just bits where they're not quite ready like my my sit spin isn't quite low enough
A	mm
B	so then it's not ready to be tested
A	oh that's alright
B	yeah
A	so like what was the last show that you did with the ice skating? I'm trying to remember
B	that was the gala
A	oh that's right yeah so that was all just loads of different bits
B	yeah it it was rubbish really and I'm glad that we're not doing that this year we're doing an actual show this year
A	I think the last show was that the like The Lion King?
B	The Lion King yeah
A	that was really good
B	or the er African Adventure as it was formerly known
A	well yeah yeah
B	yeah no it I think the problem was because we did a gala the the other groups like the
A	yeah so they it isn't really
B	so they weren't great so there was more people that and more coaches involved so it meant that there wasn't it wasn't the same as when it's
A	then you'll get the continuity and they'd know how to bring the best out in everybody rather than
B	yeah exactly
A	lots of people having an input
B	and it's controlled
A	yeah
B	like last year with our group the we ended up being given cast offs from
A	mm
B	that were a lot lower level than us and we had to like dumb the whole routine down for them which meant that those of us that were higher levels weren't getting to do anything or show off anything and it also meant we didn't have enough time
A	mm
B	to do what the coaches wanted to do but if it's a if it's a show like with here
A	yeah
B	because they
A	yeah
B	it just means it'll be the
A	well that's good because like even if you're in a group and a lot of the stuff you're having to do isn't at that high standard you should be able to hopefully do two or three or little bits yourself
B	yeah
A	to go off and actually do a little bit more
B	well some of the people that were in the groups like the top two circles
A	mm
B	are at the same level as me which is fine
A	yeah
B	and have a good work
A	mm
B	you get the ones where they're learning the basic the most basic of moves that we've all been doing for years
A	yeah
B	and then it's they don't know how to do it and you that's when you can see there's gonna be a problem because you can't put anything too complicated in
A	mm
B	because they won't do it won't be able to do it and then those of us that are that are at the top of our group because we're sort of the in-between ones we're not quite we're almost at the level of the lower lot in the higher group but they're pushing to keep up with the top group whereas if you do a show the ones that
A	mm
B	will be the main characters
A	yeah
B	with some of the ones lower down being some of the main characters
A	yeah
B	you'll then have the ones that almost at our level being at our sort of level and we could all be in a group together
A	yeah
B	because they're closer to our level some of them are are trying doubles and just about landing axels but they're actually more comfortable doing the lower down jumps so then
A	yeah
B	we'll all be around the same sort of level and a lot of people have said well not a lot but some people have said they're not doing it this year any more they're not sure if they're going to do it they might help out instead
A	cos that's one good thing with you you can actually have the flexible time at work this year can't you?
B	yeah yeah at least I have
A	whereas before you'd really struggled didn't
B	and I've got the October half term off
A	yeah
B	which was a very
A	er
B	clever plot of mine because usually we have extra rehearsals in in October half term
A	yeah
B	and I can never make any of them
A	no
B	but it was free there was like one space across the week left and I was like I'm having that thank you very much
B	so I've got that off so then even if we're not doing anything I can still go in and skate or do other things but if we have
A	yeah
B	got it planned work that we'll be doing which we usually do
A	yeah
B	I'll be able to commit to more rehearsals
A	so what date's that roughly?
B	er it's the week after my birthday
A	okay
B	so like the twenty-fifth of something I think it is something like that twenty-fifth twenty-sixth cos my birthday's on the Wednesday which I've got off and then it's
A	mm
B	so
A	that picture of dad is that the one where you went to stay near
B	yeah yeah
A	erm tell and it was when you went up the stairs did what was it you had to duck?
B	oh yeah er for
A	just made me think
B	cos it was like a converted barn or something so like those are the
A	mm
B	you had to duck under this beam to actually
A	mm
B	I thought it was safer to stay in the little room
A	yeah oh I know mum was saying all about it saying about all the things that were there from was it the old erm when it was a stables?
B	yeah that's it a stables it wasn't a barn it was a stables yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	my room was just big enough to swing a cat in but
B	it was it was fine apart from the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there was a mass of spiders so I was on spider patrol cos nana doesn't likes spiders does she'so
A	oh
B	on spider patrol
A	it was funny one of my friends put on Facebook something about erm saw the biggest spider ever it was so big it actually stopped and waved at me
A	yeah
B	there are some big spiders I don't know what it is there seem to be lots recently haven't there?
A	no it's this time of year
B	yeah
A	erm the the harvest they they cut all the the weed
B	it's probably because
A	and the the spiders all come out
B	there hasn't been Facebook has there? and people have got more so that when they're posting on Facebook
A	people are putting pictures of
B	they post the silliest things
A	yeah
B	whereas you think a couple of years ago you probably wouldn't have had that your Facebook was just about what are you doing you know keeping in touch with and now it's just post a picture of a spider
A	exactly yeah that's what makes me laugh on Facebook when people that or about the tenth person that puts it's snowing it's snowing it's snowing and somebody puts yeah I could look out the window
A	but thanks for telling me
B	yeah but then but then you you go on Facebook and you see it's snowing and if you were told you
B	like you
A	yeah
B	I've got to go and just check the facts
A	and then people click like
B	yeah
A	that you like that they've said it's snowing
A	is that the fact you like it's snowing or you fact you like that they said it's snowing?
B	or is it just because they're your friend and you think mm they've not got enough likes?
A	you just yeah you just
B	at this stage and like everything
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah it is funny some of the things people put put on there
A	mm
B	it's er it makes me laugh
A	at the minute everyone's putting on all the pictures of the kids starting first day at school the first day of
B	I got a little bit fed up of that I think well I don't mind like the first day of primary school
A	yeah
B	and I don't mind the first day of big school but I don't want to know that your child's starting year five you showed me
A	yeah six
B	when they were starting year one
A	yeah seven yeah
B	I don't yeah like great they're starting big school brilliant they're starting primary school oh they are cute you know but then after that it's like
A	yeah
B	I'm not bothered by your child at that much now like
A	mm
B	you know show me the odd picture but that's fine but
A	yeah
B	my my feed was just full of first day back to school pictures
A	yeah
B	for like two or three days
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I I I saw quite a lot of those
B	yeah
A	as well
B	yeah
A	the the photo yeah of your first
B	well your
A	well I mean I've got pictures that I took in the garden of both of you each time
B	yeah yeah I remember those
A	I've got pictures of you both on your first first day at school
B	mm
A	and then erm er
A	er at secondary
B	oh
A	she's got those
B	I know
A	and she says she likes that cos that's how she remembers you when you were both little
B	yeah I don't
A	before you grew up
B	look anything like that now though
A	no you don't actually it's it's funny looking back at some of the old pictures
B	and I was all like oh hello I'm all done up ready for school
A	yeah
A	so
B	it slipped after the first few years though
A	but that's fair enough that's exploring the boundaries
B	the shirt comes out and you know
B	tie comes down a little bit
A	yeah I remember when I was at school with our tie it was the fashion everyone used to have it in a really really big knot
B	yes
A	with just this tiny little bit poking out
B	yeah
A	and then we decided we changed it and we used to just do the back of the tie like a mod a really thin tie
A	you had the back of the tie
B	yeah
A	going right down like that
B	yeah no we had the really big knot and the er and the little bit of tie but I I couldn't be bothered with that
A	mm
B	I used to have it like loose but no I wasn't
A	yeah
B	wasn't part of the crowd
A	yeah it's funny
A	it makes you think like so who does the fashion and who decides or whether
B	yeah
A	one cool person does it or person who thinks they're cool?
B	we used to just
A	what's that mean?
B	where you get hold the tie and then pull it down really hard and it like
A	you're such a cruel child
B	I didn't do it no other people used to do it
A	you just said we just used to
B	like my friend's group used to do it and then I was the one that got very good at undoing the knots so everyone used to come to me and go
B	cos I was good at undoing knots
A	okay
B	so they used to come to me
A	yeah
B	and say can you undo this? and I'd go stand still
A	I was always really good at undoing knots if you got like
B	yeah
A	a string ball of string really bundled up
B	yeah
A	I'd be the one I'd sit there and I'd have the patience I would just sit and keep working it and moving it
B	yeah or necklaces that's the
A	oh yeah
B	where if the necklace is where you have to like wiggle it really carefully
A	mm
B	and then get it out so that it doesn't break
A	it's a real sense of satisfaction
B	yeah
A	it's working it out and just
B	yeah
A	and
B	I like that so yeah I was a
B	oh I I made up a
A	mm
B	but it was
A	language is fascinating though
B	yeah
A	I think you should be able to make up words or
B	yeah
A	or you know put words together and express how you're feeling
B	yeah
B	I can't remember what it was like it's gonna bug me
A	mm
B	but I I don't even remember I think it was something like I was saying I'm great and something else or whatever you know when you do you
A	yeah
B	that was it I said jarble it was meant to be jargon and garble I was like
B	I'm garbling or it's jargon and I went
A	yeah I'm jarbling
B	oh what it is I'm jargle it's or it's jargle and I went that's not a word
A	no it should be though
B	jargle I think so yeah
A	it should be it's a good word
B	it's yeah when you're talking jargon but you're garbling it jargon jarble sounds like a gerbil though
A	this is getting silly
B	I don't know
A	oh
B	yeah
A	well I think that's forty-eight so that must be ten minutes we
B	I hope they're going to get that at the end again we
A	yeah
