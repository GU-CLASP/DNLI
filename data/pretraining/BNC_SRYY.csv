A	yeah
D	okay you don't want toast then?
A	yeah
D	you do?
A	yeah

A	no
D	I don't think you need tuna as well
A	I want tuna
D	alright
C	to Lidl's?
D	yeah I've decided to put another tin in to be on the safe side
C	oh no no why? that's much too much now isn't there?
D	well that's you
C	are you having some?
D	no that probably is too much then isn't it?
D	yeah
C	so now that was two and a half cans
D	yeah that's too much
C	maybe just
D	what do you think?
C	just take
D	that's probably you
D	yeah
C	I'm having some I wouldn't mind three slices of toast I'm quite hungry
D	well we'll have to do them separately
C	where's
D	he's gone to have a shower
C	does he have time?
D	huh?
C	is he going to have time?
D	I doubt it
C	I mean how's he going to have a shower while we're
C	cooking beans on toast
D	actually I think I'll put his toast in afterwards when after I've shouted at him cos we're normally sitting at the table for dinner and then he comes down about five or ten minutes later
C	oh yeah we're going to need three of them
D	might need four
C	is this on?
D	yeah
C	still quite a few beans
D	the
C	or do you have margarine?
D	no butter we have
C	good margarine's bad for you really bad
D	yeah I've got margarine because
C	and you've been growing up on it
D	I know
C	it's terrible for you
D	I know
C	like
D	it's dreadful isn't it I know
C	polyunsaturated terrible crap
D	I just wish to god I knew all of this before
C	I know me too
D	no
C	it's on the bottom yeah
D	I've got some yeah
C	oh it's you've got a butter thing there yeah
D	when that's gone
C	what is that?
D	three
C	it looks like a curry of some sort or some sort of
D	don't know it's something that erm
C	something marinated
D	yeah something
C	oh is it
D	yeah
C	looks good
D	well just see what's
C	I don't know when I'm going to dad's or what's going down
D	just see what's in the freezer first use up what you've got you might need to get a few bits to go with it there's loads of potatoes down there and there's pasta and rice
C	oh look that's burning
D	oh sorry
C	why is that burning?
D	I don't know actually I think because
C	there's something in there that's not
D	yeah something's got caught at the bottom I think
C	yeah you can see it on the side
D	oh I think I might just tip it out cos I haven't
C	these beans need to cook for a little while anyway
D	yeah
C	so you say your
D	yeah
C	I take it that other plant I bought you died
D	no it's here
C	oh the
D	it's just in there
C	is it there?
D	yeah
C	oh there
D	yeah
C	oh you chopped it all off?
D	yeah
C	oh
D	I cut it all back because it died
C	the azaleas right?
D	yeah they were planted in the garden
C	see if it'll come back and didn't you have a bird's nest or something?
D	yeah it'll be in there I've never seen another robin in it you know that day I said to you like it was really really freaky the the robin flew across the garden sat on the fence and then went into the bird's nest?
C	yeah
D	and I was upset or something on that day wasn't I I can't remember
C	it's weird it does say it can take up to a year for them how long have you had it now?
D	well it must be a couple of years isn't it?
C	yeah it says about a year
D	but it flew
C	yeah it doesn't look like there's any kind of nest or anything
D	I think this should be okay now
C	but erm I think it has to
D	is it
C	it has to smell more more like a normal old thing rather than some new
D	yeah
C	yeah certainly
D	I've got a thing about it being so close to the kitchen
C	your pipes are so noisy
D	oh I know
C	I was in there and you turned the tap on or something
D	when you it's awful isn't it?
C	yeah
D	it's just like
C	yeah I think you need it
D	well yeah that's it
C	how are you going to deal with the lack of money though on that front cos obviously you need to have a bit of money
D	well erm yeah I mean
C	oh they're everywhere
D	sorry yeah
C	wow that's what is that?
D	it's a Dustbuster
C	sort of Black and Decker
D	Dustbuster
C	Dustbuster
D	brilliant thing these are
C	awesome
D	just for a quick quick fix get the toast up erm
C	right so let's put the toaster back in shall we?
D	yeah I'll just put it back over
C	all these clean things go back there
D	just turn them around there
C	yeah he's we worked out that erm doing a Saturday morning or or possibly an extra hour a day he probably would make the same money he makes from doing the gigs and he wouldn't have the practice once a week and the double gigs at the weekend I mean you're talking about
C	you do Avon as well don't you still?
D	yeah
C	it's terrible that you both work full time and yet that's not enough money
D	yeah well it probably is we probably live above what we should be living
C	no
D	yeah
C	to be able to have a house and do these things and what have you
D	I know I know but money's like water through our hands
C	yeah
D	but erm
C	no point leaving it in here
C	oh right right down to it
D	there won't be any savings I don't think but
C	there's not going to be anything
D	there'll be a property with to sell
C	doubt of all you'll get funnelled off into a home and then
D	oh yeah and then the state will take it all
C	the state'll take it all it's terrible so many of my friends are going to inherit so much money so many of my friends
D	really?
C	it's ridiculous
D	well you're gonna have dad's inheritance as well aren't you?
C	what's that?
D	well whatever the property or whatever he's left to and sells
C	well I doubt if he'll be left with much
D	well it's half his home and
C	yeah I know I know
D	and
C	that's why I mean he'll probably end up in a home at some point or you know after
D	mm
C	his pension's not particularly big
D	mm
C	no I'm talking about my friends who are going to be inheriting hundreds of thousands of pounds
D	mm
C	hundreds of thousands no worries I mean I've
D	yeah
C	and not just American friends there's quite a few British friends as well just so like
D	you were born into the wrong family weren't you?
C	the it wouldn't be such a problem if erm
C	are really not going to inherit
D	yeah
C	you know and of course you don't look for inheritance but it's
D	no it's nice to have a little bit of hand-out
C	it's it yeah it's a security blanket
D	yeah
C	but then the friends that have got it they say oh you know why are you thinking about it? we never think about it and it's like well that's cos you're gonna get it
D	yeah
C	you're going to get older and and you don't really have to worry about
D	yeah
C	pensions or you know every getting property or any of that stuff
D	but you're gonna make enough money in your own right to not need any of that
C	provided
D	do you think a child would
C	if we have a child we'll be poor for the rest of our life
D	why would you be if you've got to the status of lecturing or whatever?
C	I mean you're only on about oh that's the thing
D	mm
C	so that's means we're not going to be forty until we have children I know you were older but
D	yeah well it wasn't something I planned
C	I mean I mean if the menopause at pretty young and like is this mine or is this
D	yeah yeah they're yours that's fine I can do
C	does
D	I'll do
C	this could be
D	okay he only wants one slice
C	oh I'll just take it out do you mind?
D	yeah
C	is this mine? I mean do you mind if it's mine?
D	no
C	no?
D	whatever it's and the other one's nearly coming anyway
C	yeah wouldn't mind it a little bit less toasted
C	yeah I don't like it that
D	mm
C	I mean it's like it's awful
D	do you want to pop that up then?
C	oh there's two in there is there?
D	mm
C	well I suppose I could have these two and then we can have one of these is that alright?
D	well maybe take one of them then
C	okay
D	maybe
C	not a problem
D	he'll probably say where's his tuna
D	the tuna's gone away
C	are we all sitting round the table?
D	yeah
C	wash my hands before I touch that
D	get
C	yeah I know it does go quickly doesn't it
A	yeah
C	do you wanna come and find them then?
D	I've washed mine
C	you've washed yours
C	which direction are they living?
D	to the right
C	oh it is that way
D	yeah
C	I thought it was the other way
C	I thought it was that house with those children in it there's like a bunch of people that live over there isn't there?
D	oh right what am I doing now
C	but I mean if he's not down here
D	well I'll call him and see if he's coming down
A	I wanna eat it in here
D	no we're sitting there do you want to pause it then?
C	whatever he was watching earlier seemed whacky
D	I'll hold off putting your toast in then
C	what did
D	oh he can do his toast when he comes down it won't take him two minutes will it?
C	did he say that or is that what you're saying?
D	well he's in the bathroom so I'm not gonna put it in
C	what are you eating?
D	I don't know yet
C	I'll do the washing up after this
D	I wondered
C	might as well if I can get a piece of everything
D	mm
C	I might just delete it
C	basically
D	yeah
C	it'll become
D	very strange
C	cos yeah
C	everyone that we're recording will be used well er will effectively be archived
D	yeah
C	for what British people sounded like in the year
D	here darling did you find
C	did you find it?
D	where did that come from? there's one down here on the floor
C	yeah that was the only one
D	oh okay I'll put it on top of your bag
C	oh is the other one still missing?
D	come on sausage
A	no
D	sit down then I'll get you a drink
A	oh
D	what?
A	I wanted tuna
D	I'm gonna do you tuna now sit down then
C	well we're er
D	I'm gonna do you a separate little bit on the side
C	we're having beans aren't we?
D	sit down then sweetie and then I'm gonna go and do it
C	go on
D	oh I like that
A	I made it
D	did you wipe your hands
C	you made it I saw your dad make that
D	your nose is gonna grow isn't it?
C	I just saw his nose grow
D	here hold on stop stop
C	how long have looms been popular?
D	we need to do your nails oh I don't know I think they've only come out this summer really
C	so just big for little children really?
D	don't know
unknown_female	yeah
C	what are you having?
D	I'm gonna have tuna and cheese I think
C	tuna and cheese?
D	yeah that's what I fancy
C	is it tasty
C	that's why I'm so tall
D	well I'm glad the weather's cleared up this afternoon
C	yeah it's nice
A	fish and chips
C	fish and chips?
D	oh those fish and chips that grandpa got for us down in Devon were lush weren't they
C	can you be any more British than that?
C	you're sitting there eating beans on toast
A	yeah
D	you like pasta don't you?
D	and chicken
C	you like your pasta?
D	he likes spaghetti bolognese
C	Jelly Beans?
D	yeah it's erm a scouts' hut and it's right next to the woods
C	which woods?
D	erm
C	mm
D	is it tasty?
C	yeah it's pretty good
C	how was your bath?
B	yeah it was fine
C	yeah
C	did you have a bath or a shower?
B	had a bath
C	yeah just presume that I'm gonna be recording pretty much all the time
C	no I need you to get those sign those consent forms of
B	yeah sure
D	you don't want cheese do you?
C	you don't know where I can print somewhere near here? cos those consent forms were in my erm in the suitcase that got stuck at the airport
D	is there an internet café or anything?
B	perhaps at the library?
C	yeah mum said the library
C	where the hell's the library?
B	do you know where okay you walk down the road you keep going down to where the bank is do you remember? so it's past Sainsbury's
C	yeah
B	down to the bank
C	mm
B	and then erm that row of shops where there's like the KFC
C	yeah
B	and all that it's at the end okay and that's where
C	oh yeah behind the
D	oh my goodness
C	that wasn't very fun
D	have you hurt yourself?
C	it's behind it
B	yeah so it's
C	yeah I do remember
B	it parallels the
C	and you think you can do printing there?
B	yeah I'm sure
D	the library do you know where else I think?
C	like from a USB stick?
B	yeah
C	yeah cool
D	do you know where else I think there is? do you know erm the NatWest bank opposite
B	no not really
D	there is a place called
C	no we'll have a look into it and see what it says
D	yeah
C	haven't really found any
D	right can you take over
B	yeah sure
C	is that tasty
A	uhu
C	good stuff
A	I didn't even want a drink
D	oh well have some now I've poured it for you do you want some water then rather than milk?
A	no didn't want anything
D	okay
A	I'm going to see if
D	well can you wait please? cos I need to erm
A	no
D	okay they'll probably be back later then
A	mm
D	why don't you go and get your tennis racket out and practice up against the wall?
A	rubbish
D	well you did really well yesterday
A	I need a new basketball
C	you need a new one?
D	do you?
A	they're both flat
D	oh he needs to pump it up then
A	they would still go flat
D	you know why that is don't you?
A	yeah
D	why?
A	cos they have a puncture in it
D	that is true why are they getting punctured?
A	cos I hit them against the fallen tree too much
D	mm
C	that's no good
C	yes it's the British National Corpus 2014
B	so this isn't an
C	no
C	I don't think so no I think they just monitor people on phones I think I don't know
C	or ELT project in the future or something
B	can I have all of these beans?
C	yeah they're all yours effectively though they're just making an archive
A	I need to put my hand on there
D	get up then
C	if you think about it historically we will all be recorded in the archive of what do what do British people sound like in 2014 and you'll be a contribution to that
B	that's quite interesting
C	so it's historical
B	yeah
C	I need to see how they're tracking my bag
C	so
B	it's a shame you can't go and sit in an old age pensioners' home and
C	oh this is terrible
A	but we're never going to play slow motion
C	I've given them dad's address and I can't get through to them today I can't get through to dad today and they're trying to deliver it now it says on the thing delivery process initiated but to deliver they have to
D	there is no way of changing the address on there?
C	there's nothing there's nothing on here it's just telling me what it is it's not
D	have you tried your dad's mobile?
C	he never has it on outside of work does he?
B	it's worth trying though
C	give it a try
D	just say dad I need to speak to you urgently
C	but still how are they still going to get hold of him?
B	I don't know
C	that doesn't change anything what am I going to do? tell him to go home and stand by the phone?
D	well he might be at home
C	I don't think he is at home
B	he might be at the hospital though
C	I think they said something about a barbecue today I need to try and ring these people again I'm just annoying we have to sit there on hold for half an hour before I get through
D	mm you'll just have to do it put it on speaker phone
A	he's doing ballet ding
C	cos it's now saying delivery process initiated which means before it was saying they couldn't find one
D	okay try ringing them then
B	well that's some good news at least
C	yeah
B	it's been found
D	and especially if erm if it's not going to be delivered today and it's got to be delivered tomorrow you need to make sure someone's gonna be there
C	yeah I know
D	I think you're going to have to sit on the
C	I want to get it sent just typical though I mean why can't they contact me by email? I gave them my bloody email address
A	a
C	they always prefer phones out of what are you looking at?
B	I was just seeing how long it's recorded
C	it's on for nearly forty-five minutes we were with
B	why?
C	I'll have to listen to it and see if anything
A	oh see seen that?
C	what have you done?
C	you made him naked?
C	why d'you do that?
D	why is that funny
A	mm
C	what's funny about a bottom?
D	if you didn't have a bottom you wouldn't be able to sit down comfortably
A	mm
B	you wouldn't be able to poop
C	no
C	bottoms are necessary
B	uhu
D	don't be silly
C	nothing's funny about it
B	if
A	he's
C	no I know
A	look
D	he's doing acrobats
A	he can do the splits
C	I can't be bothered to ring these people and stay on hold
D	think you're going to have to though
C	you just never know if they you're actually ever gonna get through or not
D	mm
C	you know what I mean? I sat on hold for about fifteen minutes earlier or maybe ten minutes ten or fifteen minutes you're just like
D	and there's no email address
C	there's definitely some no
D	nothing you can reach them through?
C	no there's no email address there's nothing I can do
D	no customer service bit?
C	what do you mean
D	or
A	mummy
D	oh yeah he's doing all sorts look as his muscles he's got a rippling body hasn't he?
D	he's a got
C	why did you take off his clothes
D	mm don't go there
C	well
D	it's enough of his interest of body parts at the moment
C	remember the word eunuch
A	mm
D	right here you go
A	his knee's broken
D	his knee's broken oh I think it that one's not no it's alright he can bend
C	how did he break his knee?
D	what about his arm? his arm's all twisted round the wrong way
B	I'm surprised that you can just record anything
D	he wants to run
C	why?
B	just cos like you can imagine if two people are talking at the same time like if someone's interrupting you it makes it hard
A	I'm sitting on the toilet
B	and whatever algorithm they're using that analyse this
C	they're not using an algorithm to analyse it they're using people
B	oh right
C	mm people
B	someone's going to actually listen through to our conversations?
D	are you going to come and help me put the washing out? come and give me a hand put your shoes on
C	do you remember I was telling you about IPA?
B	yeah
C	and how I wanted them to do it some people are going to have to transcribe all of these thousands of hours into IPA
B	wow that's going to take a lot of time
C	yeah it's going to take a hell of a lot of time
B	mm
D	let's see if aunty
A	I went like this
D	don't be silly
A	oh
D	mm he's got muscles hasn't he?
C	erm they're wanting to discover the phonology I guess of how people speak in England and where they're from the form that you'll have to fill out will ask you where you're from where you live how many languages you speak what jobs you have all that kind of thing so there's a bit of sociolinguistic variation they'll probably be listening into what kind of words you use it won't be the content of what you're saying just like what words you're using and your pronunciation probably
B	yeah it's gonna be a lot of work if they have to do it by hand
C	yeah I can't be certain of that but I can I think that's what it is I can't see that they'll have a machine accurate enough
B	well voice recognition has got quite far
C	yeah it has
B	I mean it could pick out a word out of a sentence and then if it just looks through all the data that it's accumulated looking for that word and then finding all the variations of it could improve its accuracy
A	is your six-pack like that?
C	but perhaps they're getting the information to find the different variations of it maybe they don't have all the variations of the word
A	is your six-pack like that?
C	oh my six-pack's better than that
A	let's see
A	much better than that?
C	but I mean they're not just breaking down the words they're not separating the words they are then breaking down all the sounds of the word
B	mm
C	into the separate
A	let's see let's see let's see if it's better and that let's see if it's better on that
D	mm
A	let's see if it's better on this this back let's see
C	once you get outside of command and you start using polysemy using words that have a meaning that's more metaphorical it's very difficult for the machine to know whether I'm actually using
B	mm
A	let's see
C	sorry
A	let's see if yours is better than his
C	for example if I was to say I'm high how would the computer know whether that's spatial or whether it's metaphorical?
B	it wouldn't
C	no it wouldn't
B	if it's out of context and you just said I'm high we wouldn't know either
C	no erm but it wouldn't ever be out of context
B	no
C	not really we always have a lot of clues that will tell us
B	yeah
C	what the context is but of course yeah if you take a sentence on its own and take it out of context then yeah it's very very difficult to tell
B	yeah
C	but that's where the computers have problems because there's so so many words that we use that are completely metaphorical
B	mm
C	they just don't
B	mm
A	this isn't a standing up game
C	but is it not is it a sitting down game?
A	uhu
C	looks like a standing up game to me
A	it's sitting this is what you do you do do do
B	speaking metaphorically is kind of like combining the multiple senses that make us human
C	mm
B	and like a machine can't do that
C	no
B	they're not that advanced
C	but it's so common in our speech
B	yeah
C	it's ridiculous interestingly the word I was reading an article about how the word literally how it's now come on to have a completely opposite meaning
A	it's not a standing up game it's not a standing up game
C	what is it then
A	it's it's this game
C	it's a sitting down game
A	yeah
C	oh okay it's Fizzball isn't it?
A	I don't know
B	yeah I see what you mean if someone says I literally can't wait
C	it means figuratively
B	that er yeah yeah
C	it
B	that doesn't mean that they're actually going to go walk out
C	no literally has taken the opposite meaning it's taken a completely opposite meaning to what it used to be people say it all the time like I literally can't be bothered to do this
B	then why aren't you walking out the door?
C	yeah it's strange isn't it?
B	yeah
C	but a computer wouldn't be able to pick that up and you'd have to have it so updated all of the time with everything they really need still humans analysing this and as well problem again with the computer is with homophony or homonym where a word has the same pronunciation but a different meaning and how would a computer be able to pick up whether I'm talking about a bat or a bat?
B	mm
C	it would have to understand the entire context of the sentence
B	yeah
C	and what I'm talking about and I could be saying it completely separated
B	yeah
C	so it would be really difficult for them to know again which word is being used
C	oh I think mum needs your help it's too windy out there she was just calling for you
A	no
C	show me how fast you can run earlier you were like I can run like super fast
C	go on quick I bet you can't do it in three seconds three
A	no
C	two
A	no
C	no look mum needs help look how windy it is
A	you can't do it till I you can't do it till I'm erm on the grass I have to run round the run round three to
C	you just burping away there
B	I'll be farting outrageous
C	yeah would do
B	from them beans
A	I have to run round I have to run round the garden and you have to and I have to try and do it in three seconds
C	go on then if you can do it in three seconds I think mummy definitely needs help
A	I'll try and do it in three seconds and run round
C	cool
A	in three seconds I only have to run round once only once
B	you should find er erm a pensioners' home just go and sit with them and listen to them natter
C	definitely
A	hey
C	just listen to them talking
B	yeah
C	I do have to get them to sign consent forms but once they've signed once consent form like once I get you to sign the consent form that's it I don't have get you to kind of sign a consent form every time
B	see if you can get the like the whole group to do it
C	yeah to do it
B	or go to like I don't know I suppose that would be more difficult but like Alcoholics Anonymous or something and just sit
C	I feel pretty lucky to have come across this cos they don't make these corpuses very often
A	I'm doing it in three seconds
D	go on then darling
C	in fact I'm not even sure if they've got one I think this is the first recorded one
B	mm
C	that they've done they've got a written one
A	have we
C	okay I'll be doing that definitely erm
A	now
C	okay three last corpus they made was they got three hundred million words is the last corpus so that was all writing
A	what was it?
B	it was about eight seconds
C	it was about eight
A	oh
C	can you do it quicker?
A	I'll try
C	you need to get it down to
A	okay
C	they erm you'll go on the computer programme and you'll type in a phrase an idiom a lexeme or something or other and then the machine will tell you how common it is or like other random statistics so then they use it for ELT books that's how they make their money because then they make five so close one more time and I think you can do it in three
C	give it a try
B	It's actually about ten
C	so they use it in ELT books so it will say in the ELT book it will say a phrase and it will say according to the Cambridge Corpus this is the tenth most used phrase in such and such so
B	yeah
C	you know what I mean? that they're common in
B	careful
C	so I guess they will make money off this somehow
B	yeah
C	you may even find they take snippets
A	what was it?
C	part of the consensus that they can it can be replayed in other places
A	what was it?
C	so you could find you get put in a textbook somewhere you know what I mean?
B	I don't know you could be in a film somewhere or they've got this hologram that says
C	yeah I know
B	it can be replayed
D	what was it?
B	it's your voice
C	you did it in three seconds
B	yes I have just one of those fads like Pokemon or
C	does yeah but it's a bit worse I mean it looks terribly boring
C	do you
B	yeah like Wacky Waving Inflatable Tube Man
C	yeah
B	they do
A	hi
C	hello
B	I guess all they did was put a bunch of advertising on it and give it hand it out at schools
A	this is what you have to have
C	has it got advertising then?
B	well no but I mean they can does it come in packaging?
C	yeah I don't know
B	loom band?
C	yeah probably
B	well you have to have a name sounds like a brand
C	looming it's looming
B	so that's your hat
C	oh
D	not back yet
C	he's not back?
C	oh she hasn't replied?
B	oh
C	I know I'm I'm going this afternoon
B	yeah
B	there you go do all the family rounds it'll be such a good
C	problem is I think
B	why does he have to come?
C	I don't know unless he stays with you
B	mm
C	yeah that's exactly it and then it kind of makes it difficult to record when he's there
A	I wanna come
C	I know you wanna come
B	do they need like child data?
C	no actually you're not meant to record anyone that's less than eighteen and I have to get my mother to write consent for him but in general they don't want people but I can't what can I do about that? there must be a lot of people that have I mean the children are everywhere
B	mm
C	you can't really avoid it can you?
B	no okay so that Dictaphone you've got
C	yeah
B	is don't know it looks directional
C	yeah I think it slightly is I keep trying to point it roughly at people
B	yeah
C	pointing at the ceiling at the moment though
B	yeah cos otherwise it would have it would have to come out of the device
C	yeah it's picking it up pretty good
B	mm
C	it's the sound quality's quite good it's about forty pounds so two hours of recording will pay it off
B	that's good a Sony
C	yeah
B	no I won't
C	we're getting on for an hour
B	yeah
C	I pause it as well I paused it earlier while I was eating and then un-paused it I made sure that I stopped talking and paused it and then re-started talking and un-paused it but I don't know if that's actually allowed I'm not so I might have to get in contact with them
B	well during moments of silence I don't see the problem
A	I can get them
C	no I don't see the problem either
B	and well I suppose the conversation would suddenly change you know
C	yeah
B	or the context and everything changes as well
C	but it doesn't really
B	yeah
C	I can't really complain
B	are you sure they're not going to like take your MP3
B	and it's actually about four minutes of speaking
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I mean if we deleted all of the er the blank and it can't too much empty space though
B	oh no
C	people talk pretty consistently
B	yeah
C	I just need to try and record as many people as possible
B	mm
B	yeah
C	while we are here and that means we need to do five hours of recording each week every week
B	yeah but that's
C	until next June
B	like that's what? forty minutes a day and you're over it
C	yeah
B	it depends how much of a pain these forms are
C	they're not too bad
B	no?
C	it's just like two pages just asks you some basic details I think you hit the nail on the head though going to an old people's home
B	they do
C	effectively just go and do some volunteering at an old people's home
B	yeah the old lady across the street loves to chat she'd probably have good conversation with you
C	yeah
B	er like I went to pick up a parcel last week and
B	at the door
B	oh she was just like oh she wanted to know about
C	yeah
B	but like you really get caught there and you can't leave
C	yeah with old people they just talk don't they?
B	yes they do but they get lonely so
B	I'm like oh
B	I can't leave now
C	yeah
B	yeah I got reeled in yeah
C	harsh but true I should probably ring these people shouldn't I?
B	indeed if you want your bag back you'd better
C	yeah I kind of do want my bag back
B	yeah no worries
C	in the next few days he'll probably come over
B	yeah I I've run into him a couple of times in the past couple of years
C	have a good chat to him
C	yeah he's a good guy he's getting married but he hasn't invited me the bastard
B	oh shit
B	that sucks
C	yeah he's getting married this month next month
B	are we gonna mention that to him?
C	no it's his prerogative if he doesn't want to invite me I guess I've realised that you know
D	yeah just gonna wash up and then we'll go and sort out some stuff shall we?
C	I need to ring those people now so I'll do that now
A	six
D	okay cool
