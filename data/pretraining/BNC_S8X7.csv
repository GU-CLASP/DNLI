B	no but this is a fake thing
unknown_female	like a boot neck is a royal marine
B	but I'm not talking kind of slang
A	slang
B	yes so what they do is they work out whether your brain can latch on to how a language I structured basically
A	shit
B	yeah
A	so you do it when you're in there then?
A	you don't do it as
B	it's not that post hasn't been made yet
