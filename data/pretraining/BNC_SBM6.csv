A	she's she's well up for like
A	exploring the world
C	take your take your clothes off and
C	let's
A	just put your arms around me and pretend we're in love
C	ah
A	yeah it's a bit sweet it's a bit weird
A	two ways of looking at it
C	it's a little bit sweet a bit weird
B	sweet and weird
A	sweet and weird
C	she's too fucking small for that kind of shit she's too fucking small
A	she's too small but she's so sexual you should see the dancing that she does interpretive dancing
A	all over the place
C	ah
C	she doesn't know she's confused she's trying to work some fucking shit out
B	no course she doesn't
A	oh yeah she doesn't know
B	course they're not the same things
A	no I know but she's just
B	yeah
A	it's she sees things in films
C	but she's also yeah
A	you pick that shit up
B	yeah
A	like everything's so sexualised
C	yeah but like
A	but also some people are just like that from a younger age
C	yeah
C	also I think like if you're
A	mm
C	and just really used to saying things in front of adults then maybe you would just say
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	like what's in your head cos probably you're
B	slightly weird
A	yeah it's
A	no I know she doesn't
C	she she like she doesn't know
A	I mean she doesn't she wouldn't know how crazy inappropriate that
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly like if you were seven or nine or whatever it'd probably be
A	which I'm not
A	you know I'm not
D	look at that baby
C	you're the one asking a little girl around for sleepovers
A	that's true I did give her a lot of wine
C	get some give her some rom coms to butter her up
C	ply her with Haribo
A	yeah I think she er she she's just quite
C	I
A	yeah it's different
C	just in terms of
A	just the sheer volume of like media as well
C	yeah and how you're it's impossible to be er protected and I think I was protected quite a lot I mean but not even intentionally
C	just cos the society protects children
A	mm
C	or it did at at that
A	mm
C	I can't imagine what it's like it'd be fucking crazy
A	I also think like her mum's really attractive and like quite
C	yeah
A	how that beauty and that femininity affects people
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	and like you know
C	for sure
A	she'll she'll have noticed that and absorbed it and she also
C	definitely
A	is like very pretty used to like getting a lot of attention and compliments
C	yeah yeah
A	cos she's like she must just be like so fucking like fascinated and ready for that
C	yeah
D	yeah cos
A	yeah what? who?
D	yeah or like cos I remember everyone all everyone trying to hit on my mum like when she was just getting petrol and stuff you know
C	yeah yeah and and like if you imagine how that if er if you were a girl what what would that make you think about?
A	I remember
C	ah
D	you're a handsome woman
C	ah pretty and handsome
C	that's sweet?
D	what?
A	only
C	you're so pretty and so handsome
A	so handsome
A	it's cute right
C	so pretty and so handsome
A	huh yeah
D	what? she said that to
A	yeah
D	not to you
A	no she said it to
D	oh man
C	so pretty and so handsome
A	mm mm should put white wine on it babe
C	what have you done? spilled red wine down your white T-shirt?
A	put mustard on it babe
C	yeah it must be so confusing
A	mm
A	but in a way like it is how the world is
C	yeah
A	and it's like you know it's a bit sooner but I don't think that's too much for someone to take on and like I er I mean some er like friends of people I've known like talk about like being really sexually aware from a really young age
C	yeah
A	I think it's also just like
C	yeah yeah no for sure I just think that like erm in my mind that
A	mm
C	like whoever that may be
A	yeah
C	which is actually much closer than you think but
C	yep
A	when she was a kid she er she was she was like well up for it
C	yeah
D	that one?
C	no no no no
C	no not my youngest nephew the younger brother of my from my other er nephew's and he's like
C	and cos his er his older brother is really like beautiful and and and and very social and everybody basically gives all the attention to him
A	mm
C	cos he's ginger and like just really vocal and you know and and the little brother's basically ignored and so he just fucking trashes like trashes everything
A	mm
C	cos that's the only way that he gets
C	any attention and it's so obvious but like as soon as you see the two of them you can tell you can tell exactly what's gonna pan out and then they and then they fulfil it in every single way
D	yeah it's like
C	and all the adults around them totally fulfil that that that whole like everybody knows what their role is and it's completely fulfilled and every box is ticked
A	mm
D	yeah it's like Horrid Henry and Perfect Peter do you remember reading those books?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
A	which one were you babe?
D	I was Perfect Peter obviously
C	yeah
D	he used to trash all the shit as well

B	whether or not you can be bothered with him is the other question like
A	it's not even really
C	whether you wanna go to bed with him?
B	no no no like he's a dick but
A	like like you can't you
A	really can't invite him to anything
C	I'm a hundred percent done I'm a hundred percent done
D	how come? he used to hang out with
A	yeah I think even
C	even
A	fucking what a mess
A	but er
C	really?
A	I think or like maybe not shooting up on the train
B	no probably like
A	shooting up is a separate thing but like
C	well probably I wouldn't be surprised
A	getting like doing heroin on the train like by himself in the toilet that's quite bad I reckon do you reckon that's bad?
C	that's really bad
B	yeah yeah
A	I dunno anyway I'm gonna see him
C	I think I think if you were to say something to him it would er be good
A	heroin?
C	yeah but just
A	I know like
B	he doesn't care what anyone thinks though
C	but I think but the thing is
C	I think he he like builds up what he he
B	yeah
C	because you've like kept him on on hold for a while cos he's been
B	he's a he's a
C	you know what I mean?
A	bad man
C	just like just like
B	no no
C	no because because
A	yeah I know I don't
A	he won't change though you know
C	no but it seems a bit like at the same time it's either like
A	yeah
C	and it's like one or the other and I'm and I would just like I'm done I'm not gonna tell him unless he asks
C	I'm
B	yeah but you yeah no no I was just I was er just saying the third option
A	but what's your what's your
C	just hanging out with a dick
B	I was just saying the third option
A	ah
B	er I can explain like my
C	yeah but he's really rude
B	yeah but he's also like a friend
B	like with plenty of flaws but who is like I think genuinely a good person
C	okay well that's yeah that's your opinion I disagree
A	I think I'm obviously more in the middle like I I I don't know if I don't know if honestly I think that he's a good person but
B	I think he has fucking shitloads of flaws
A	like I think when it comes down to it if he can get away with it he does like you know
B	yeah he's also like er like if you hang out with him sometimes it can be way better than hanging out with other people
A	yeah
B	cos he's not that
A	but the then that's I guess what I was gonna say I don't really think at the heart of it that he's a good person that's not why I like him but there is
B	no it's more the fact that it's quite funny to hang out with him
B	yeah you're right no it's not cos he's a good
A	he's kind of a friend in a way and er you can have lolz with him I dunno yeah on balance it's a bit fucked but I will I will see him and like
B	yeah
C	working yeah
A	like when he's sober and he's like totally like
B	yeah the same with us as well
A	great to have around
C	he's the best he's a hundred percent best
A	yeah
B	we met him working at
A	funny like makes it like fun just like I thought he was a really cool guy
C	and you have that glimmer of like like you and you see the like brilliant side of him that no one else really sees
A	yeah no one sees
C	no one sees that
A	like which I didn't even figure out till much later it's like oh shit you're like that all the time to everyone else
C	yeah
A	I thought it was just you know I caught him on the odd bad night but yeah like
C	what? at Lapland?
A	like no before at
C	yeah
A	mm
C	like I find it a bit like like I don't know I don't know why I have to give him any more slack
A	I guess like I wouldn't give him another chance
D	don't give him any more slack
C	just like totally done totally done
C	yeah yeah I guess I guess I
C	yeah you're right I guess I've I've probably never really consciously had er any friend who who I would
A	mm yeah it's definitely a weird one
C	er I I just find it
C	and I and I
B	no I don't think that's the case because er it's not inexcusable the things he does people don't talk to him he knows that people don't talk to him he gets upset about it
C	yeah but I think the only reason he gets
A	if he could away with it he would
C	pardon?
A	if he could get away with it he would
C	yeah exactly that's that's the thing and er and I and I understand that everybody has their bad side and like you know we could all be fucking horrible if we wanted to I just don't like
A	I wanna try it
C	yeah
A	I wanna see how far I can push it
C	yeah
B	how horrible can you be?
C	like really horrible
B	oh really
C	horribly horrible
B	yeah?
C	if I wanted to be
B	how horrible?
C	of course
A	let's all find out let's do it for a week
A	just do it for a week just go invite yourself round and just and just go to everything you can and just be like
C	I could
B	no he's funny when he's sober he's really funny
C	I know he is funny but like even when he's not like totally fucked up and like paralytic in the corner and really embarrassing everybody even even when he's not that he's still really really really
C	he's mean to
B	yeah it's funny cos
C	but even like like even the way that he like even the way that he talks to
B	yeah it's just like she never does any selfless act like if she if she gives you something she will she always expects it later in return
A	yeah
B	she probably loaned him fifty quid and
A	mm
B	said she wanted it back
A	maybe that's the way when like he was like this is
B	she's the Australian girl right?
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	fuck like you see this like glimpse of like and it and it's the same as you it's like it's not like I don't like him because he takes drugs or has a you know like that's got nothing to do with it and like you don't see him for a while and you sort of forget and then you hang out and he's funny and er but like sometimes you see a glimpse of like how he is and it's super gnarly like it's just it's a bit it's a bit like
C	yeah
A	when he was hanging out with
B	that's weird because I heard this story that she went to his house for Christmas
A	yeah that was
B	yeah and then
A	like what?
B	well
D	get you own back
C	probably yeah
B	exactly that's what I mean like I I'm not saying like
B	that's the right way I'm just saying like they're the kind of stories that like go back and forth with him
A	yeah well I mean to be honest
C	yeah
A	it er er it's not that I know I don't know
B	I don't know her and I know
A	she's trouble or anything like that
B	and I know like a few people that are hanging around to me they all seem a bit
D	also wasn't
B	and they all seem a bit fucking crazy like
D	wasn't
A	no totally I'm not saying that any
B	yeah
A	it was just mean and like disrespectful
B	yeah
D	also
A	yeah
C	mm
D	and
C	that's a bit wrong
A	it is a bit weird
C	that's a bit wrong
A	poor
C	yeah
B	but I don't know yeah
C	but I just yeah but like yeah
B	but er erm
C	I think that the the like
B	ah
C	the way that the way that
B	yeah yeah of course
C	on that alone is enough for me to never talk to him again in my life
B	yeah yeah yeah that'll do that's true that's true
C	to be honest
A	yeah
B	that's true that's enough
C	like that's enough
D	what's he saying?
C	need to never ever talk to him again
B	oh you know it's just like
C	just like
A	slags slags
B	like nineteen's nineteen forties misogyny that sort of thing you know like
C	like he's
C	like he thinks that women are basically objects like er or at least he thinks that thinking about them like er trying to think about them in that way is cool because like that's the
C	that's the goal
B	yeah he thinks all women are stupid basically
C	he thinks all women are stupid and only it's the like oh the only women who are worth hanging out with
B	yeah
A	are stupid
C	are are are beautiful ones like at least and they have to be very thin like
B	ah that's true yeah
C	they have to be very very thin
C	and if they're not then like you know you may as well not really bother because like what's the point? er as far as I'm concerned on that
A	I agree with him
B	yeah of course I mean
C	that's the that's the underpinning everything he thinks about
C	er about women and erm just like
A	that's the one thing you should never do
A	yeah
B	like
C	I don't know like that er that that's enough
B	he does think that all girls are stupid
B	no
C	but that's enough
