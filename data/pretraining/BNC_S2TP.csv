A	ooh let's have a look then
B	okay so
A	oh wow look at that
B	it's quite big actually
A	what your allotment or the plan?
B	yeah a bit well both
B	it's not to scale erm so the gate would be here
A	okay
B	and then
A	is it all fenced off then?
B	so there's a fence round the outside
A	is there?
B	yeah
A	oh that's very London
B	erm
A	is there?
B	and but that's cos so the allotments are all dotted around er this estate so there's
A	mm
B	and then there's two next to us so
A	okay
B	so
A	cos the allotment's down my parents' allotment is there's no gate so it's all just
B	they yeah
A	open
B	there are they have those in London too with like a big fence around the outside
A	oh yeah er
B	yeah
A	there's no fences in
B	yeah
A	in
A	okay so the gate's here
B	erm you know I leave mine unlocked most of the time because it's I feel like people can enjoy if they want to
A	oh
B	the gate's here and I was quite lucky that there were several raised beds there already
A	okay
B	these three are like really big robust good raised beds
A	okay yeah
B	erm and then there's this one which is a bit rickety but it would do
A	okay
B	and then there's
A	so have you got like wooden like boards around the
B	yeah they're about they're about
A	the
B	half a metre high
A	oh are they?
B	yeah they're they're
A	oh quite high then
B	and deep
A	yeah
B	like my biggest problem at the moment is I need to fill them with compost and manure and I need
A	ah
B	tons of it
A	yeah
B	erm I've found a stable where I can get some free manure but
B	I haven't been haven't been to dig it yet
A	yeah
B	erm then there's one that's like small concrete and like it's
A	oh
B	the the
A	around the outside?
B	yeah it's just
A	oh
B	paving slabs like they're only like
A	that's odd
B	twenty centimetres high
A	er yeah okay
B	of the beds to kind of keep it in
A	mm
B	erm and there's there's random paving slabs and the ground is actually particularly here is really
A	mm
B	uneven
A	okay
B	erm so what I'm gonna do yeah I've got three raised beds
A	yeah
B	one's gonna have salads in it
A	yeah
B	one's gonna have like spinach and chard and leafy things
A	wow
B	one's gonna have beans
A	yeah
B	erm and I'll put something else at different times of the year
A	yeah
B	and then this trough is gonna have edible flowers
A	okay
B	and arables and nasturtiums
A	oh cool
B	and then all along this fence
A	mm
B	I'm gonna have raspberries
A	mm
B	so I've worked out one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve plants
A	that's a lot of plants
B	I love raspberries
B	I'm gonna start jam making and then erm three gooseberries
A	yeah
B	two loganberries and two redcurrants
A	okay
B	erm so that's gonna be sort of my soft fruits area
A	mm
B	I've got a compost erm sort of wormery here
A	mm
B	here's my shed
A	okay
B	erm
A	have you replaced the shed yet?
B	no
A	are you gonna keep it?
B	at the moment it's fine I need to reroof it
A	oh yeah
B	but
A	I remember you saying
B	I would like to replace it with a half shed half greenhouse
A	oh cool
B	but I haven't got
A	oh
B	my contract I'm not allowed
A	okay
B	a greenhouse
A	okay
B	but we're forming this committee
A	yeah
B	and then we can kind of make up the rules
A	oh yes
B	so
A	I remember you telling me about that
A	okay
B	so in theory I want to do some rainwater collection
A	yeah yeah
B	a fiver
A	they sell them at the council in
B	oh
A	really big must no they're compost bins sorry
B	oh compost yeah
A	mm
B	but there well there was one of them there already actually
A	yeah
B	there's quite a few things there erm
A	is that a seat?
B	yes but I think I I I guess I haven't made up my mind
A	you're gonna replace it with rhubarb
B	what to do
B	I think the rhubarb will go so I've got tyres
A	oh cool
B	I've got some tyres that I'm gonna put the rhubarb in
A	oh okay
B	so they're gonna act like raised beds
A	yeah
B	so they're gonna go there the strawberries which are already in and that's the first thing I've planted
A	oh brilliant
B	erm got my first chard harvest as well
A	wow
B	mm and then there'll be another bed for tomatoes here
A	tomatoes?
B	mm
A	do tomatoes not need to be grown in quite warm temperatures?
B	they're fine here
A	every time I've seen tomatoes they've been in a greenhouse
B	don't need to be
A	really?
B	yeah don't need to be at all
A	yeah cos my grandparents always put them and my next door neighbours
B	could grow them grow them here
A	who were old-fashioned
B	they grow better
A	oh okay maybe that's it
B	I mean and you get you
A	and they always grow them out of growbags as well the ones I've seen they have bags rather than
B	you can but if you've got er it's better to put them in the ground
A	mm
B	so I put them in the ground and then but you need to construct
A	yeah I was gonna say yeah
B	they need erm
A	okay
B	and then wrap it round the tomato
A	mm
B	so it's erm but like a string so it's flexible so it can move and grow with it
A	okay
B	erm so yeah and then a bed of courgettes
A	courgettes lovely
B	and then this is sort of a nondescript veg patch
A	I was looking at that I was wondering if that was the
B	not entirely
A	thought of?
B	sure yet erm but probably
A	what about potatoes?
B	I'm not sure I'd bother with potatoes
A	leeks?
B	yeah maybe leeks maybe garlic
A	onions?
B	maybe maybe onions but they're really hard to dry successfully although in this house it's so hot
A	you'd probably do it in a week
B	erm
B	er carrots
A	oh yes carrots
B	erm
A	what about something like turnips? or no not turnips
B	no
A	squash? how easy is it to grow squash?
B	maybe squash yeah very easy actually
A	mm
B	so I'll probably grow pumpkin so sort of seasonal things
A	sort of seasonal things yeah
B	yeah so I mean and that will be that's just sort of I mean it's quite a big area
A	cool
B	but I probably won't do it all at the moment this still has like metre high grass on it
A	oh does it?
B	I found a door as well
A	did you?
A	oh
B	there was there was there's a shed here at the moment that's being removed
A	oh okay yeah
B	there was a small shed in this corner that I smashed up on Saturday
A	oh yeah?
B	and then and there was so much junk inside it like I found erm a Hoover from like the nineteen sixties like an old upright
A	did you?
B	Hoover I found so much junk I found so many shoes
B	just yeah and this this is why I'm not gonna dig down any more I'm gonna go up
A	ah
B	because there's quite a lot of and it's also so the site where erm the whole estate is an old horse hospital and there's quite a lot of bones
A	an old
B	horse hospital
A	hospital?
B	yeah they
A	just for horses?
B	yeah from the from like army
A	yeah no don't dig down any more then yeah
B	and I found quite a lot of bits of bones like it was a bit weird
A	ooh did you?
B	yeah
A	yeah no just
B	erm
A	yeah yeah that's a really good idea
B	but this seat is gonna be like erm a swing seat
A	oh cool
B	that's what I really want anyway
A	yeah
B	may as well have it and then a little armchair and stove
A	so this is where you're gonna be walking when the baby arrives he's gonna get the pram and walk to the allotment
B	hopefully
A	how far away is it? you said it was
B	it's about half an hour to walk
A	yeah that's about that's a good distance then
B	yeah erm
A	so it'll be it'll be summer
B	yeah I can
A	it'll be nice and warm
B	I mean I can drive in five minutes if I'm being lazy or get on the bike
A	oh cool
B	so you can walk or yeah so it's gonna be nice
A	so did you consult with
B	erm she has suggested some things but this
A	cos
B	erm
A	yeah
B	mixed I mean you want to rotate so this is my first year plan
A	okay
B	and then I'll probably move everything on one bed for the following year
A	every year?
B	well these are all annuals
A	but you need to move them every year?
B	you should do
A	my dad doesn't I think he does rotate them but I'm pretty sure it's not every year
B	but the other thing you can do if you don't do it then you just need to replace like put lots of manure
A	that's what he does
B	or do
A	he does it every year he gets
B	green manure
A	yeah
B	which is clover so I tried to plant clover in the rose beds this year
A	oh
B	but it I didn't get there in time and it didn't germinate but I got all these leaves in this one
A	yeah
B	erm and I sent
A	yeah
B	look like clover or
A	poppies?
B	yeah cos I had it
A	oh
B	in a so she gave me a envelope full of
A	yeah
B	clover seeds and also she they've got some amazing giant poppies
A	mm
B	at her farm
A	yeah
B	so she gave me some of the heads
A	okay
B	and I think that they must have fallen in with the clover
A	ah
B	and they germinated and the clover didn't
A	oh how funny so you've got a bed full of poppies
B	I know which is not really where I want it cos it's in my salad bed
A	you you want it
B	I might have to have a half salad bed
B	er the then at least if I get the poppy seeds then I can move them and then
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	for next year so yeah I mean they'll be really beautiful so if that's what they are
A	yeah
B	but there's there's load there's like an area like that that's just
A	they're massive as well aren't they?
B	thick
A	yeah
B	I mean at the moment they're just like they look like sort of little dandelion leaves
A	okay
B	but they're slightly hairy I probably shouldn't have eaten one
A	no probably not eh
B	yeah and trees
A	oh yeah?
B	so I'm gonna put one here and one here
A	are these oh they're not there already?
B	no there was a bit erm horse chestnut tree here
A	oh wow
B	erm like bit like the the erm the trunk was like half a metre diameter
A	oh my god
B	erm I quite wanted to keep it but the council said that it was above it was too big for the plot so I'm not allowed
A	ah
B	trees more than twelve foot high
A	okay
B	erm
A	yeah
B	goodness from the land
A	yeah definitely if it's that big
B	there was one here and one here so
A	yeah
B	this
A	yeah
B	but it means that they've left quite nice stumps for sitting on as well
A	oh cool
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but and I haven't quite decided what trees
A	apple trees?
B	I keep uming and ahing
A	pear trees?
B	I think I think pear I don't eat enough pears
A	apples?
B	to warrant a pear tree but I think apples could be good but maybe a mixed variety tree cos you can get them where
A	mm
B	they've got different varieties grafted on
A	oh
B	so you get it like
A	yeah I remember having a lecture from my dad it's all so very complicated
B	yeah
A	which tree you put next to each other so that they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	on the Royal Horticultural Society website
A	yeah
B	there's like a
A	ah
B	of apples will will cross-pollinated other
A	okay
B	so you need to get two you either need to get one that's self-fertile
A	yeah
B	or get two or get
A	okay
B	a tree that's got two that are complementary grafted on
A	mm
B	the same
A	okay
B	you can actually get a mixed apple and pear tree as well
A	that sounds a really
B	which I was thinking of
A	weird
B	sound really weird I know I didn't like that
A	it sounds really odd
B	yeah
B	and then I was thinking should I go for something more interested for the other like a fig
A	okay
B	so I'm not sure but
A	yeah you want something that's not going to
B	no and you know it will
A	mm
B	cos at the moment I've just got a full sun plot
A	yeah
B	there's no area
A	mm
B	that's not sunny
A	mm
B	erm at all except for I guess right in front of the shed
A	yeah
B	but where I got this plan from
A	mm
B	what I was working on this book called The Half-Hour Allotment
B	so the theory is that you
A	mm
B	the right plants you can get yourself food every week of the year
A	oh wow
B	and erm you only have to go is it it's half an hour
A	oh cool
B	or you could condense that into longer slots at
A	yeah
B	the weekend so it but there's a lot of set up
A	yeah
B	and then the theory is all you need to do is pop up and weed
A	brilliant
B	do a bit of watering but actually like the guy in the plot next to me says he doesn't water
A	okay
B	what he did for his raised beds which he made all himself
A	mm
B	and then manure and compost on top of that
A	okay
B	and because the cardboard is so wet and
A	mm
B	retains the moisture he hasn't watered all summer
A	wow
B	and he's got some
A	so there was
B	he's still got sunflowers in his bit
A	oh really?
B	November it's crazy yeah
A	so he just put his beds on top of the grass then?
B	yeah
A	he didn't dig them over or anything?
B	no he went up I mean and most people
A	I mean that's interesting
B	because of all the bones
A	yeah of course
B	have not dug down they've gone they've gone up instead
A	yeah no fair enough
B	but yeah
A	that's really exciting
B	yeah
A	erm
B	half of it
A	yeah no maybe not
B	no
A	it looks like a longer project
