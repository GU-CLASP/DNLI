B	so was she actually lying or sitting on the stool then?
A	she was just yeah she was sitting on the stool

B	the table
A	and then Mr
A	and like put his face
B	are you alright?
A	like right really
A	and he sticks his head like right in her face
A	it's like yeah he's like
B	I think he's way to worried about how people
A	yeah like Miss
A	are you okay?
B	she'd just be like well I don't care if you're alright or not
B	I'm just gonna sit on my computer doing whatever
A	yeah but he'd be like properly concerned he'd be like are you okay? he kept just kept asking me like are you okay are you okay? I'm like I'm fine
A	I just don't wanna be here
A	but then he's like
A	I was like oh okay I think he might have heard me cos I went thanks
A	and then I went to
A	I'm like
B	this is this is
A	mm
B	why he needs to be a primary school teacher
B	this is what you need a primary school
A	the compliment
B	teacher to be
A	yeah and he tries to
B	he would be a perfect primary school teacher
A	I know maybe we should suggest
B	all of his ideas everything he does
B	how he treats his pupils
A	yeah
B	you need to go are you alright? do you need
A	and if it's a fifteen-year-old and you're like are you alright?
A	and they're like mm
B	if it's a fifteen-year-old lying on the table you just need someone to
A	when are you leaving?
B	that whole walk we were just talking
B	cos then we thought he was really cool
B	cos
B	we thought he was really cool and really nice and then
B	oh
A	and he was like oh
A	and then even Mr
A	you're a bit weird
B	all I think all science teachers are slightly weird
B	yeah well he is
A	I dunno cos I don't have him do you remember when he was
B	he is a bit
A	calling his wife? he was like I'll put on a nice lamb for you tonight
B	I've got
A	I've got a nice lamb is that alright?
A	who else is there? Miss
B	yeah
B	yeah she's really nice she's a really nice person
A	yeah she's probably like one of my favourite like teachers she's so funny
B	yeah
A	I just love her but
B	she's just not a very good
B	like actual teacher
A	I know she just
B	goes
A	she's like
B	way too fast and
B	yeah
A	Mr
B	yeah
A	and he expects everyone else to know what he's doing but
B	yeah yeah so he just like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	okay er he won't even ask he'll be like right
A	I'm not getting
A	because you picked it up really quickly when we didn't do any of our homework and I'm still there like hold on a minute wait what's a cadence?
A	yeah
B	like having to try and understand him going right this is one this is
B	four this is five
A	mm
B	these are the main ones
B	this is how you do a
B	chord five to one is a perfect cadence
B	chord four to one is an imperfect cadence
B	this sounds like a full stop this sounds like a comma
A	a
B	right
A	this is a semicolon
B	next
A	yeah but to be honest everyone else I
B	yeah cos
A	wait a minute
B	cos I bet they weren't even trying to understand it
A	yeah
B	just write it down and
A	or they all just understood like
B	I didn't understand though
A	how did
B	yeah
A	but
B	well why did he decide to take music?
A	I don't know because drums yesterday he was really
B	I think he's one of those people that loves listening to music
A	yeah like
B	so it means that they think they are musical
A	yeah
B	and that they love music as a whole
A	I know
B	but just because they love listening to music
A	yeah like rock music
B	and like yeah and because especially if it's like mm not pop music
A	mm
B	and you think you're like really cool and you're like listening to pop music and you
A	yeah
B	er not
A	indie
B	pop
A	yeah
B	or R and B or
A	or Marilyn Manson
A	yeah but he was like
B	so he thinks he's like really musical
A	yeah
B	and really into music but it's just because he likes listening to music
A	mm
B	and he kind of plays the drums
B	who? who were you till
A	erm
B	saying this to?
B	yeah
A	I was like it's not really a big deal for him
B	because there's only gonna be like one one drummer
A	yeah
B	that actually wants to be
A	yeah
B	you know cos I always feel really sorry for the drummers
B	because
A	yeah
B	Mr
A	yeah but
B	is so mean
A	to be honest it's good for him like he's really good now he must be way better
B	yeah I know
A	when he started he was rubbish
B	yeah
A	but now he must be really good
B	cos it's like the tough love
A	yeah
B	that's actually
A	it's like that film
B	a really good way of improving
A	you know that film with that guy from erm Divergent in it? and erm it's he's a drummer and the can I think it's called like the conductor it's not called the conductor but there's a conductor that's really horrible to him and saying like you're failing like do you just not get this cos you're stupid? that's like Mr
B	I haven't seen that film
A	I haven't seen it either I just saw the adverts
B	oh
B	what with erm Theo James?
A	not Theo James
B	no
A	the guy that played erm
B	I haven't
A	the bad guy
B	actually seen it
A	you know Peter?
B	yeah
A	him
B	I can't remember which one played Peter
A	yeah well it was that actor that played Peter
B	I haven't actually I still haven't seen it
A	oh it's rubbish don't see it
A	don't see
A	mm
B	oh there's Theo James oh
A	yeah like even when we watched Seventeen Again she was like oh hello when Zac Efron came on and I'm like can you please stop? and like yes I know I know he's really attractive but you don't need to be like oh like that every time he's on the screen
B	oh
A	but then didn't I thought it was really depressing at the end of that when it just went back to that old man
B	yeah and he was
A	because when Zac Efron said it it was so cute and like romantic and then it was just that old man like I'm in love with you
A	it's like
B	and he was like
A	oh
B	with his beer belly and then they
A	yeah
B	do the whole spinning round thing again
A	yeah
B	like recreating it and he's like I'm gonna have to put you down now cos I'm not very strong any more
A	and I was like
B	his beer belly
A	it's just literally just ruined the whole film for me
B	yeah
A	but it was basically just Back to the Future
A	they were like it's nothing like Back to the Future I'm like
B	because it's exactly the same
A	it's completely like Back to the Future
B	except instead of going backwards
A	yeah
B	he's going kind of forwards in a way
A	yeah but it's like the same the back
B	but it's like he doesn't cos in Back to the Future he doesn't want to accidentally kiss his mum
A	yeah
B	and this is like he doesn't wanna accidentally
A	and
B	kiss his daughter
A	kiss his daughter
A	he's like his mum fancies him and his daughter fancies him and you're like well yeah cos in Back to the Future they go back in this they stay the same but he just changes
B	yeah
A	and goes back that creepy guy the guy on the bridge
B	that janitor?
A	yeah that scared me so much
B	mm yeah that was so creepy
A	I literally I screamed
A	and he turned around and he was like
A	gone and I I was literally like
B	I was really scared when he
A	yeah I thought the janitor was suddenly
B	ah
A	gonna like kill him or
B	but then it's like
A	and then at the end the janitor was like way hey
B	yeah
A	but it was like
B	yeah
A	that bit was weird like the flashback and then he was like oh like that and went like that and she was like oh my god
B	yeah that thing with the
A	oh my
A	I was like oh my god that's so cute but then he turned into that old man I was like oh
A	I know
B	I think it should have just been
A	I was like what happened?
B	yeah
A	like
B	and also he's thirty-seven
A	yeah
B	the guy
A	how do you know that?
B	er because it
A	said
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	anyway it's the guy's thirty-seven and he goes back to being seventeen so seventeen she's pregnant so they all have a baby when they're seventeen and then the children are seventeen
A	oh yeah one of the children is
B	not thirty-seven
A	seventeen?
B	yeah the daughter's seventeen
A	which means she was pregnant
B	it was
A	she was
B	but they're
A	oh
A	yeah but was she pregnant when she was seventeen?
B	yeah cos that's that's the whole reason that she that that that erm whatever Zac Efron erm didn't like walked out
A	oh I didn't see the beginning
B	you didn't see the beginning?
A	no I did put it on from the bit where they were in the garden and he was saying the divorce isn't is no is only in two weeks
B	why?
A	I dunno that was just where she started it
B	oh you have to see the beginning cos then it all like adds up cos like
A	oh
B	at the end it's exactly the same as the beginning
A	so she was pregnant?
B	yeah so at the beginning
A	yeah
B	basically it's like a flashback to when they've both seventeen
A	yeah
B	and he's like amazing at basketball
A	yeah
B	erm and they
A	yeah coming yeah
B	the scout from there it's exactly the same in the beginning
A	oh
B	so he's like warming up and then he's like oh just warming up and then he's like oh but there's a scout so if you play as half as well as you I know you can
A	yeah
B	or whatever
A	yeah
B	so then he plays but he doesn't play properly and he's like mm
A	yeah
B	and then she goes and walks out
A	oh
B	he looks at her and walks out because they basically broke up because he wants to go to college and play basketball
A	but she's pregnant?
B	she's pregnant so then he in the middle of the game just suddenly walks out and follows her
A	yeah
B	and then she's like oh no go back your future is there you can go to college and he's like no my future is with you and the baby and then and then that's in that corridor and then they kiss and then they like do that twirly thing and that's why at the end he's like right I'm gonna have to put you down now I'm not as strong as I used to be
A	oh okay I get it
B	and that's why they got divorced because he always kept going on about how erm
A	he could have
B	he could have
A	gone to
B	if he didn't
B	he could have been a successful basketball player basically
A	oh
B	so the whole film you should have watched the beginning I can't believe just didn't show
A	but also that coach it had been twenty years he was like the best basketballer on the team and the coach didn't recognise him?
B	I know cos it's exactly the same coach
A	nobody recognised him mm
B	it's just a slightly different haircut
A	mm
B	why wouldn't you
A	yeah it is really unrealistic
B	cos they're like the wife recognised him thought he was
A	yeah she was like you look just like my husband when I was
B	seventeen
A	when he was seventeen
B	and he's like mm yeah
A	and then he tried to kiss her I was like
B	yeah I think I would have like if I was in his position I would have done a way better job as of hiding
A	yeah
A	yeah cos he was just like
B	he was just
A	you're going out with him?
B	yeah
B	yeah whatever it was
A	yeah and then he
B	putting on the
A	yeah no what was it? Alex what's
B	yeah
A	it was like do you dance with your friends' mums?
A	yeah
B	so excited
A	erm so
A	yeah
B	she
B	the whole
A	it's like are you in RE with us?
B	yeah like she forgot I was in her art
B	ah she just forgets about me
A	and I'm so annoyed that Mr
B	I know
A	because how am I meant to pass that stupid exam? if like literally a whole year of
B	I can't believe that yeah
A	and did you know about
B	no
A	did I tell you about that?
B	yeah
A	controlled assessment they told her it was too long and that she had to rewrite the whole thing she was like right fine I'll rewrite it they threw away her book
B	huh?
A	her textbook they threw no not her textbook her like book with all of her notes on her old essay all of it they threw it away
B	why?
A	the janitors like just threw all of their books away
B	oh my god
A	write rewrite the whole thing with no notes and like no other essay
B	that's
A	so I bet they
B	so bad
A	threw away our books as well like how annoying
B	how can you do that?
A	then Mr
B	you should just be like well I
A	mm well I'll bring you average grade down by getting a G
A	yeah cos if everyone else gets an A and I get a G that might bring it down to a B
B	yeah
A	maybe I'll do that just on purpose just to make Mr
A	but then that will throw up on my thing it would be like English seven
A	maths five RE G
B	yeah you're gonna get more than seven and five
A	five yeah Miss
A	I want an A and an A is a seven isn't it? because eight is A star and nine is A star plus
B	is seven an A? oh
A	yeah
B	well then seven is quite good
A	so I'm like well no and
A	who do you think I am?
B	but also oh I don't I don't know
A	that's like in English I can't be dealing with
B	what do you mean?
A	like all the examiners mark it differently
B	yeah
A	so even if Miss
B	it doesn't mean that you're gonna get a high grade
A	the exam it doesn't mean you're good it just means that the that she
A	gave you a higher grade that's what that's like that's what I don't like about English cos you can't really say if it's right or wrong
B	yeah
A	but then that's what I don't like
B	that's why I prefer maths
A	yeah but then that's what I don't like about maths that there is just right and wrong
B	yeah
A	I just don't really like mm English or maths I'd rather I just didn't have to do them
B	I wish
B	we didn't have to do English and English literature
A	yeah
B	that word was
A	yeah I can't even remember what the word was
A	er what was it?
B	I dunno
A	something seded
B	yeah
A	superseded
B	oh yeah
A	I was like
B	yeah yeah she was going
B	really?
B	I
A	and then I think she was she was a bit surprised she was like and
A	yes yes
A	yeah but it was I was only it was only cos I guessed I was like I was just looking it and I was like well doesn't that mean it's just like kicked off his little podium
B	oh yeah
A	I was like ah has it just when he got taken off? and she was like yes and then
A	literally she is
B	it's just she just
A	so her bag is so neat it's like she puts it in like that and she's like
A	and when she gets everything out she
B	she gets out her glasses case she opens it she takes them off and she folds it
B	carefully puts her glasses on
B	then folds
B	erm the little like screen wiper
A	yeah
B	over the top and then closes it
B	very carefully
A	whereas I'm just like
B	places down the side in this little slot she's
B	saved for her glasses case
A	yeah but whereas we just like chuck everything like oh god
B	yeah
A	and then I bet she has no rubbish in her bag when I found in my bag
B	yeah
A	I found like half eaten
A	when I emptied out my bag at the end of the year I just found like a packet of raisins like all over the bottom of my bag
B	cos I think I had just like a crushed granola bar
B	that I put in the bottom one day and now I take out
A	ah
A	well one time all my
A	and
B	it's not a raisin
A	I was like it wasn't a raisin it wasn't a raisin
A	so
A	like I dunno how it happened I just get so much random stuff in my bag
A	and one time
B	it's
A	I got like
B	oh my god
A	that was not
B	three times
A	yeah if she ever does that again I'm actually gonna punch her in the face
A	I'm gonna be like look
B	look this is not funny
B	you think you're the funniest person in the class
B	but
B	to be honest she's not
A	the funniest in the class
B	but thinking actually
A	er she's probably really
B	you're right
A	yeah but she was like oh and I was like but in a good way
B	and it's so it's
A	it straight out
B	it's like
A	say
B	she
B	our
B	I am the funniest person
A	and then I was like properly
A	guys aren't I funny? aren't I funnier than
B	you're just funny
A	cos you're stupid
B	mm yeah
A	and
B	which is funny you see I'm laughing
B	yes she's not I think that funny
A	I say silly things I'm not actually that funny though
B	yeah
B	funny is cos she's just
B	that made us laugh because you were stupid like I was
B	when she was like do you remember when she said she was like guys I have a Wagamama cookbook
B	and I was like mm and no what was it?
B	she was like I'm so looking forward to cook all of it it's gonna be so
B	fun and I was like I'm so looking forward
B	to hearing you trying to pronounce some of those names
B	cos it's like oh yeah
A	oh
B	I made
A	do you know what I would
B	no what was it she
A	yeah
B	she just has this
B	and I'd be like I won't be able to come to that
B	I'd be laughing at her too much
B	like
A	ah
B	I'm gonna make some erm chicken erm
B	katsu
B	curry
A	ah you know what I really want to say? cos she goes bright red every time someone's talks to her
A	Miss
B	she's actually quite awkward
A	and she's like
B	yeah
B	and like
A	yeah and she was like er no it's fine I was like
A	and I really wanted to bring it up when I was like I wonder if I can think of something stupid that you've done that was funny?
A	and I was like I can't say that that would really offend her
B	yeah I that's what when we were like try and think of something funny that you did
B	because it was stupid I was like mm trying to pronounce those
A	mm
B	Japanese
A	yeah
B	loving to go to Yo Sushi and she's like oh yeah I like having the beef erm
B	teriyaki

B	I think it's
A	yeah
B	the right way to say it
B	oh yeah
A	the Arabs
A	I'm like I and he's like I oh I'm like I think that the Arabs have a stronger claim to the Arab land because the Arabs have been here since ages and the Arabs
B	does Mr
A	no he says Arabs everyone says oh well I thought everyone said Arab until
B	but how
A	I dunno I dunno
A	I just everyone's just
B	when like Arab is a word that you say quite a lot
A	yeah
B	like you hear quite a lot
A	yeah
B	how can you say Arab?
A	how much were you worried when
A	and like what are you gonna do with your life when you can't even understand the question?
B	it's like oh wait it's
A	it's the question
B	in the question
A	yeah but she was asking like what the most stupid and
B	and
A	who was it that
B	and Miss
B	well pirate is probably a bad thing so
B	maybe barbaric is a bad thing as well?
A	yeah but surely barbaric is just like crazy
B	yes well done yeah
A	but she never said that
B	it's like brutal or
A	she
B	yeah cos it's like barbarians
A	yeah
B	that's how I do it barbarian barbaric
A	yeah like barbaric I'm sure there was a thing on Horrible Histories it was like barbaric
B	yeah
A	the
B	yeah barbaric well it begins with a B
A	but some of the
A	the
A	like
B	I know
B	like
A	I felt really bad
B	what was
A	yeah and she was like
A	yeah but I feel really sorry cos Miss

B	so annoys me
A	she's like
B	I was just gonna say that
A	yeah
B	like she's just wants to be so liked by Miss
A	I know
B	that she can't even put it into her own words
