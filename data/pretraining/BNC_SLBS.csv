A	but you
B	the tango one
A	but you can play properly I I can't
B	no I'm really I've got worse like I have to slowly do the the notes and everything so I've got worse and I haven't got any vibrato or anything and she does
A	yeah
B	she doesn't like it she she only likes upbeat music seriously
B	she just wants something to dance to she doesn't want any
B	see? she likes your
B	she er well I've had her in the chair that's the thing I had her in the chair I tried to play a song I need to practice because I'm just getting worse and worse I need practice but she won't let me again she went through this phase before
A	mm well I I thought
B	and then
A	she didn't like House of the Rising Sun
B	no well she
B	you hate that song don't you? I need to learn the words to something else then I would be able to
A	ought to find out what music she likes
B	well from looking at her earlier she likes
A	eighties music
B	dancey pop she does like eighties too cos
B	and she likes old
A	oh yeah?
B	yeah what was that song that she
A	violins?
B	no erm
A	I dunno

A	Prince?
B	no it was like a love song a love ballad thing it had some violins and she want
B	to the song
A	oh
B	I haven't played that in ages because
A	there's no violins
B	we haven't had it set up
A	well you can think again cos I'm not buying you a violin
B	oh
A	no well er
A	it depends how they're played
B	it's a good instrument to learn erm fingering
A	yeah
B	fingering and vibrato
A	but I'm not
B	and like
A	listening to screechy violins
B	and it's good for your ear
A	yeah
B	that's why it's screechy it's good for your ear because you have to not like guitar where you've got the tabs and basically
A	mm
B	if you get your finger in the right spot it's okay violin you don't have that
A	mm
B	you have to find the right note
A	mm
B	that's why it's good
A	so you have to find the right spot by your fingering?
B	shut up that's
B	oi
A	you walked into that one
B	I know oi
B	I'm talking about our
B	oh
A	and you don't wanna
B	I knew I could see that coming actually I
A	yeah

B	oh god it's a bit worse oh no
A	are you gonna come in come in the kitchen with me?
B	oh god
A	what do you want? a coffee?
B	oh I've just had a drink thanks I'll just have
A	oh
B	some water
A	well I'm gonna make a cup of tea
B	did you like your your lunch today? erm
A	yeah I did although it did have a funny taste to it
B	why?
A	I think that fajita mix gave it a bit of a weird
B	it did
A	taste which I wasn't that keen
B	it it was a bit weird
A	but generally it was very good
B	yeah
B	yeah I know what you mean cos that's
A	some weird
B	that's the problem I had when I after I'd cooked it
A	yeah
B	it tasted funny and to be honest this fajita mix is erm er it's got it went hard but I thought it would
A	well how old is it?
B	it well
A	was it open already?
B	I used it before summer
A	or was
B	yeah it was open and
A	oh ah
B	it was quite hard
A	it's probably got maggots in it or something
B	it hasn't got maggots in it and anyway maggots don't make it taste like that it's the
A	how do you know?
B	like erm
A	yeah
B	are really expensive here
A	well if they don't
B	it's easy
A	taste good then they don't taste good do they?
B	there's no MSG no artificial flavours
A	I don't care if it if it tastes horrible then
B	it didn't
A	well it wasn't no it wasn't horrible
B	no but I was thinking
A	I didn't mean it like that
B	it was for fajitas it's for
A	mm
B	chicken fajitas
A	yeah
B	it's not for
A	beef
B	beef
A	chilli
B	chilli
A	con carne
B	no
A	yeah
B	that's why
A	yeah
B	I couldn't see the ingredients so I didn't know what exactly what was in it that's the
A	mm
B	problem if I knew what was in it I might have gone oh oh maybe not in a chilli someone's tidied up my spices
A	oh
B	and I wanted to
A	it's not me
B	throw away this curry powder it's not real
A	yeah throw it well just give it to the cleaner or something
B	why? it's horrible
A	well
B	here's some horrible curry powder that's got
A	well can we do
B	so it will just make a big thick curry gravy
A	there's loads of it well can we do something hearty with it?
B	no I know it might make like erm you know like chip shop curry?
A	right

A	I dunno
B	we need to make some chips then
A	chip

A	I don't think you can replicate chip shop curry
B	I'm sure there's a recipe somewhere
A	only chip shops can make that
B	I'm sure they just buy it in frozen glutinous form
A	don't ruin the magic
B	ruin the magic of chip shop curry?
A	I want chip shop curry now

A	Chinese wife
B	mm dunno
A	erm
B	there's one what's that?
A	that's not a mozzie that's a
B	oh
A	mm don't know what that is
A	er yeah he was like how long do you expect it's gonna take us to do these note taking marking and
A	and I've made it easier
A	by having this grid
B	yeah
A	so what's the problem?
B	yeah
A	and he just went on and on and he like and he and his voice was getting really angry and shaky and
B	really?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	he was saying well it took me a lot longer than twenty minutes
B	yeah
A	that's his problem jesus
B	yeah but the they
A	he makes himself look like a tit
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they need to go and get themselves another job
A	exactly
B	and see how much shit they have to put up with somewhere else
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	they don't know how good they've got it there
A	no
B	complaining about that about marking
A	yeah
B	come on
A	and that's his time management
A	that's the problem
B	I don't know how they've got
A	he's going
B	the audacity to
A	he's going it's only worth five marks why do we have to spend so
B	because it would help the students it's for their progress jesus
A	no but you don't have to spend more than
B	no
A	do you?
B	no you don't
A	it would I reckon I'd spend two minutes
B	well they
A	per student
B	they were talking about erm you know checking some people are checking all of the plagiarism things in the notes some people aren't and so some people are spending a lot longer doing it
A	but
B	yes
A	apparently
B	they decided that in in our meeting
A	the paraphrasing
B	the paraphrasing bit but they still need to paraphrase the summary or something
A	yeah
B	in the summary so you've just got to check
A	so you don't need to paraphrase all your notes as long as you put it in quotation marks
B	that's what I thought yeah yeah that's what I said and then
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah
B	that's your style that's how you'd do it
A	yeah
B	erm I'm gonna tell them please put quotation marks around anything that you've taken out
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	just put page numbers next to it
B	yeah
A	well that's how I'd do it
B	because
A	but
B	yeah
A	it's silly that we teach them exactly how to take notes you know it depends how they want to do it you know?
B	well no I I think given the flexibility
A	but if
B	if
A	yeah but if
B	I'm gonna check for plagiarism for core notes one and two because you see that text over and over and over
A	yeah
B	everybody's doing that text
A	yeah
B	three and four are not gonna
A	yeah
B	not gonna check it
A	well I'm not gonna I'm not gonna trawl through the
B	no but
A	all the reading material
A	mm
B	that are on the reading list
A	no
B	yeah
A	realistically
B	that was kind of that was left up in the air
A	not when there's seventeen
A	pieces of each of those essays
B	yeah
A	so you're talking five essays
A	five times seventeen
B	yes
A	some of them are fifty pages each
B	no no that's what what they erm
A	that's just
B	so you don't know
A	we we
B	whether it's plagiarised or not
A	no but you can tell
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	we can tell when oh hang on a minute that doesn't sound like a
B	yeah
A	eighteen-year-old
A	I mean it's not rocket science
B	no
A	and speaking
B	no I don't wanna do er maybe speaking because that would manage my time for me rather than having a big pile of paperwork just going to work and doing it
A	mm I don't know
B	yeah I'd quite like to do the speaking actually yeah I might say something
A	mm
B	don't know it's I just find it difficult to manage my time when there's hundreds of papers in front of me
A	it is
B	how many
A	quite intimidating
A	when you've got like seventy
B	seventy?
A	it's well I think I had about seventy to mark
B	seventy what?
A	essays
A	oh I can't remember
B	group work essays would be smaller won't it?
A	oh group ones
B	that's the second semester wouldn't it?
A	okay group work maybe I had thirty er thirty forty
B	oh my god that's loads
A	yeah and then you get ones
B	and then you
A	and then you've got to second mark some of them
B	second mark
A	and then you've got to third mark some of them
B	mm
A	plus you've got to do all the standardisation before you
B	then you've got to write
A	yeah you've got
B	full feedback
A	yeah you've got to write like a hundred two hundred words for each one
B	mm
A	first few are alright well no the first few are horrible cos you don't know what marks you're giving or anything
A	but then once you've kind of got that measurement in your head
B	mm
A	twenty
A	you do one and then count how many you've got left and you do another one and count how many you've got left
A	but if you are really good with your time and you sit down and absolutely blitz it for a week
B	yeah then it's
A	then you
B	better for
A	you could finish like three or four days early
B	yeah that's what
A	and you've got but that would really be pushing it quite taxing on your brain
B	mm yeah
A	cos you can only do
B	that's what
A	mm
B	the other
A	it was seven like those group work ones maybe seven a day marking is
B	oh my god that's loads
A	it's a shitload
B	I would struggle with that because I take too long
A	I was
B	doing that kind of thing
A	with the individual ones I used to do fifteen fifteen a day?
B	what was that last semester?
A	so I I had yeah I had erm yeah about seventeen
B	what two thousand words?
A	yeah
B	oh my god
A	had about seventy-five to mark
B	mm
B	mm
A	plus then like and putting the grades into the computer
B	mm oh
A	it's
B	I might I might do a few bit of hinting
A	but I I was told that it it gets moved around who does it one year and then
B	really?
A	well that's what I'm going
B	why? do you know how to do it better now?
A	well
B	you've already done it once surely it would be easier for you to just keep doing it in the same way
A	I dunno
B	wouldn't it?
A	what else is there to mark?
B	well you've maybe you won't be doing it this semester then
A	and I've never done of the speaking
B	did the exams the exams were like summary writing oh no erm with the
A	mm
B	because you go in you've got all those hours
A	yeah it's all it's all swings and roundabouts
B	yeah
A	don't I don't care what I get
B	don't you? I just don't fancy those big ones cos of my time management is not good anyway hey ho
A	anyway we've got a few months before that
B	hey ho
A	don't squeeze it
B	I'm not gonna
A	I know what you're like with spots
B	oh I won't squeeze her I was I've been very good with her and her skin I haven't touched anything
B	I do my own
B	disgusting pigs
A	oh
A	so the vision people must have like
A	when they're listening to this
A	we sound like a couple of
B	well you
A	slobs
B	we
A	er twits or something
B	well you do sometimes have food in your
B	stubble
B	god we're not no we're

B	I don't
A	mm
B	maybe in the
A	Japanese?
B	eh?
A	Japanese?
B	Japanese well I don't want to walk all the way if you think the pollution is bad I wouldn't want to walk all the way to the business district
A	mm
B	that's too far to walk but it's too close for a taxi
A	mm
B	it's too close to wait around for a taxi anyway
A	mm yeah
B	I was thinking more like in the city Korean
A	it's I don't fancy Korean
B	you don't fancy Korean? you fancy Japanese though?
A	yeah I'd prefer Japanese
B	Japanese well I would I I I I'd quite like to go out for dinner yeah why not? Wednesday dunno midweek?
A	what time are you teaching?
B	nine
A	oh okay
B	but we've got to be back to put her in bed anyway
B	I can plan I can plan my classes in the evening I mustn't make a habit of this though I'm ruining my evenings by having by bringing the work home with me just because
A	mm
B	I want to come home and play with her during the day
A	mm
B	I shouldn't do it really cos that's I need my own I need my own time
A	I haven't got any
B	this morning you you know that noun
A	mm
B	er
A	what the whole thing?
A	what?
B	yeah well erm
A	they er they had to skip the last three exercises
B	I did I did the self I had to do the self-study exercise in the class
A	really?
B	so I was like oh my god this is this is really too early to
A	I didn't get to show the high
B	what were you doing?
A	do the author and the writer thing
B	that's what and I saw everybody else in the classes and they had load of stuff on the board
B	everything I did all mine on er Powerpoints and stuff
A	no I
B	but the
A	what I did was
B	I was like oh my god what have I missed out here that
A	when they had to write that rewrite that paragraph
B	oh that's what I didn't do
A	that took me forty minutes
B	I didn't rewrite the paragraph I just we talked about the differences
A	oh yeah
B	and then I went through and we'd got the
A	and then they take text one and they rewrite it
B	but text one rewritten is text two
A	no they said don't look at text one and they said transform each sentence like cos it had the mistakes underlined
B	where did it say to do that? where did it say to do that?
A	I don't think it did
B	yeah oh
A	just decided to do it
B	oh you decided to
A	so I got the students to all do it individually
B	yeah
A	and then I got up a Word document
B	oh hello you alright? oh you look tired she looks tired
A	then I got up a Word document
B	oh it's okay it's okay oh it's okay grumpy face are you alright? is it because we're not playing properly? we're just sort of all wobbling about? yeah?
A	so then I just asked for volunteers to give me one sentence at a time
B	yeah
A	and then they would say and half the time it was shit and I'd write word for what what they'd said
B	yeah
A	and then we'd go through it and try and improve it
B	okay
A	did that on every sentence and it took ages
B	oh right it's
A	and then I went back afterwards and tried to make like subordinate clauses and stuff on some of them saying okay how can we join these two sentences together? and
B	oh
A	did all kinds of stuff with the
B	really? I didn't do that
A	yeah that's what most of the class was
B	oh
B	well they seemed to be they seemed to have got it maybe I can do that in my class tomorrow
A	yeah it as really I think they would have enjoyed it
B	I didn't do
A	you get agitated with all this
B	blah blah blah what
A	crap
B	did I do? I thought my class was
A	cos they're so embarrassed
B	quite interactive
A	well it's embarrassing cos they all that work they were set for homework
B	yeah
A	and then you get in class and
B	yeah
A	and they're just sitting there going well we've done all this what's this lesson about? we're just going over the homework basically for two hours
B	right so tell me this activity then okay you've got
A	well I just told you
B	right no but erm
A	well
B	see which ones are best and then
A	no
B	take the best
A	well I just picked form the register to start with
B	oh okay
A	see what they did
B	cos some of them are really shit
A	yeah
B	some of their sentences
A	that's right you write up the shit sentences and then
B	but
A	you get the class to try and improve it
B	right okay
A	it was fine
B	so alright so every every part of that text okay I'm gonna have to have a look again
A	yeah
B	alright
A	well that was that's good they like that
B	but I did erm
A	kind of thing
B	what did I do? I did like a memory quiz for what not to do in academic writing and I dunno I mean
A	I don't know if it did say to do it or not
B	it said it said think of alternatives but we just did it as a brainstorm in class
A	oh
B	but I they enjoyed doing that
A	they did
B	and they found it helpful I'll do that too
A	cos it was the only productive thing they did I the whole class I found
B	ah really? oh okay
A	they need some part of the class where they're actually sitting down and writing something
A	and they're never writing for a whole
B	oh god
A	it's just all theory
B	oh god
A	that confused the hell out of me
B	well at least you did something good with them of the
A	mm
B	I I don't why haven't why hasn't that been changed? surely people complained about that question
A	mm
B	last term?
A	yeah
B	you you've got to say well the noun phrase okay the question is asking you what the known phrase is after the verb and what the head noun is
A	mm
B	and then what's the head noun?
A	yeah
B	it's a stupid stupid stupid question
A	no
B	mm
A	after the verb?
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	although that shouldn't technically be called the head noun
B	mm
A	well it's the head noun
B	it's
A	of that phrase
B	of that phrase
A	and that's it?
B	yeah
A	not
B	mm
A	of the sentence of that phrase?
B	yeah
A	so they do all that thinking okay that's the rule and then they turn the page and say actually
B	actually you need to look at the other noun
A	look there's another noun here before the verb
B	that corresponds with the verb
B	that corresponds with the verb so do all the other nouns not correspond with the verb?
B	which nouns?
A	well the ones on the
B	the first page no they don't match
A	they don't match with the verb
B	they don't match with the verb because they go with the other nouns that come after the verb
A	so the head noun is always before?
B	but the question looks like you're looking at the verb and you're looking at the noun and they they're looking at the head noun like the the noun that corresponds to the verb for the whole sentence
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but you've got to stand there in class and say well actually this question doesn't really make that much sense what some of you have put this this and this and I wrote up
A	mm
B	put for the head noun in the first of the noun phrase it's stupid
A	mm
B	and they're all just sat there with their mouths open and went oh okay and then we had to move on because I'm I couldn't explain it
A	but you can't explain it
B	any more
A	cos it doesn't make any sense
B	what when you say
A	of their book and you tell them
B	yeah the first page of their book oh this is a crap question
A	yeah
B	you can't
A	so the hang on so just to carry on with that again quickly cos I've got to teach it again tomorrow
B	mm
A	so the first page they just want the head noun of that phrase so communicable diseases
B	yeah
A	is the head noun of that phrase? that's it
B	and the question says look at the noun phrase after the main verb
A	yeah
B	mm so that doesn't have to match the main verb
A	no
B	basically
A	yeah
B	and it says find the head noun erm look these are head no it it just talks doesn't it it doesn't even give them an exercise
A	this is what a head noun is
B	these are head nouns the head nouns tell you the main idea and they match the verb that's what it says on the next page
A	yeah they match the verb
B	mm
A	but the ones on the previous page didn't match the verb
B	no
A	and they're called head noun
B	they're called they are head nouns of that noun phrase
A	yeah but that's what it should say head nouns of the phrase
B	yeah
A	and head on the next page head nouns of the sentence
B	well I don't know is that what you call them? head nouns of the sentence
A	mm
B	I guess so
A	but I don't think they should be called head nouns on the first page at all
B	no
A	it should be like the dominant noun or the
B	mm
A	the most
B	I don't know I don't know
A	yeah I can't believe that's there
B	but I know that I've got an American girl tomorrow in my class that is bound to have some questions about that activity
B	and on the first
A	mm
B	well the second lesson yeah
A	cos it took me ages to she
B	I should have warned you last night
A	and I was just
B	I saw it and I remembered from last year
A	yeah
B	I thought you
A	and then I had a student come up and half time and and say well hang on a minute
B	yeah
A	why is it diseases or something
B	I wonder if there's another terminology for the head noun of the sentence?
A	well at least I've I'll be able to cover my arse a little bit tomorrow with that
B	but you've got a relational is it called a relational clause? the first one is a relational sentence
A	right
B	you'll find that they've all given the first one as a correct answer it's both the head noun of the sentence and the head noun of the second noun phrase
A	mm
B	cos it's a there are clause
A	right
B	there are sentence or whatever I've forgotten what you call those relational sentence?
A	I don't know
B	related to the world for something what is it called?
A	there
B	there are
A	there are don't know
B	oh well anyway
A	who wrote that?
B	bad question
A	jesus
B	and nobody else has said a word about it
A	well you should write it on that feedback the weekly feedback thing
B	yeah okay
A	it's what you're supposed to do I didn't write anything on it last year
B	I wrote a little bit
A	so it's my fault this problem's still here
B	it's everybody's fault the problem
A	well yeah
B	is still here
A	yeah but I remember we I remember last year we
B	I never did the first few weeks
A	remember doing this
B	but after that I did few
A	do you know
B	less
A	I haven't done a single one
A	mm
B	so it's a shame if cos he wanted to change the
A	he basically the reason they showed that is to get the verb agreement
B	yeah but
A	so why not teach something that actually
B	is the
A	goes directly to that rather than some
B	why
A	confusing the fuck
B	well
A	out of them?
B	why don't they look at the head noun of the sentence or the head noun of the first
A	mm
B	noun phrase? is it a mistake in the book? should it say
A	mm
B	the main verbs
A	yeah
B	you need all the information in the noun phrase
A	yeah
B	not I the verbs
A	yeah
B	I dunno I said something I can't remember
A	mm
B	mm
A	okay that's enough talk
B	I don't know
A	about work
B	yeah I know it's
A	it's
B	oh I've got to plan for tomorrow yet
A	right well
B	is it alright then?
A	eh?
B	okay enough about work
A	yeah
B	we shouldn't be talking about work at all at home
A	well we have to blow it off sometimes don't you? I know well you do you're a woman
B	what?
A	well if I wasn't doing this recording I would just go in and stick some music on and go in my cave
B	what? you wouldn't be talking to me?
A	no
B	that's really mean
B	you wouldn't be talking to me if you didn't have to
B	what?
B	I think you need to make up with me for that I don't like that
A	no I'm pulling your leg
B	eh?
A	I'm only joking
B	no you're not joking
A	I am joking
B	you're not joking
A	so we're not going for a Japanese? or
B	well I thought you said it was too polluted to go out
A	well you just had a look on the thing and it was alright
B	but they are burning a field
A	burning a field's not bad is it?
B	yeah a lot most of the pollution comes from burning rice fields
A	yeah?
B	mm yeah two types of pollution one from burning the fields one from the construction
A	mm?
B	mm but to grow rice you have to burn the field why it's one of the problems they've got in China cos they grow so much rice
A	mm
B	but then they didn't have this problem in Vietnam and they grow enough rice there
A	it's the construction I think they probably shift a lot of the blame onto the burning the rice because they know that nothing can be done about that and the people who need their rice
B	they accept it yeah
A	they'll accept it more than say yeah
B	mm that we don't need
A	yeah
B	mm?
A	people would
B	they will need them when the population increases again
A	hang on they'd need the population to double to fill these this area
B	it will double people are allowed two kids now
A	it well these places will are only built to last ten years
B	oh well that's a bit pointless then isn't it?
A	eh?
B	that's a bit pointless then they only just brought in the law that they can have more kids
A	look at the state of it I mean like one of the Sunday plazas that they're knocking down I bet that's only ten years old
B	well what will happen?
A	it's cheap
B	it won't fall down will it?
A	well they they're the first one will probably fall down and then they get everyone to move out
B	no
A	no
B	although I never forget those ones in Korea that fell down
A	no yeah
B	because of the cement
A	yeah well that's
B	mixing cement with paper?
A	yeah
B	I dunno they did some shit
B	what was it? mixing cement with something
A	yeah I I wouldn't be surprised if they're doing stuff like that here
B	mm but they
A	so got knows what
B	they do have
A	they're doing here
B	big strong metal rods through buildings now don't they? like especially tall buildings
A	well it's supposed to
B	oh you're scaring me now
A	no I mean look how shoddier this workmanship is
B	I know really shoddy
A	it's really shoddy
B	yeah
A	got those big cracks I know they were only on the er
B	yeah I know what and you think the people who built it
A	I mean what what's this gonna look like in five years?
B	yeah
A	and then you compare that to a home that's built back you know in England for something
B	mm
A	which
B	this is supposed to be posh and it's just not is it?
A	it's a shit hole
B	yeah it's weird isn't it?
B	no I don't see how that's possible
A	if it is then you know we are right on the crest of a bubble at the moment
B	that new couple who have they've got a place over by I think over by
A	yeah?
B	yeah because different your other areas
A	should a alright
B	yeah? erm the other areas
A	mm
B	than this
A	mm
B	it's just the area
A	well you're talking
B	yeah or
A	which you
B	further
A	can't do in this weather maybe
B	mm
A	further yeah it's too hot so you'd need to to get a taxi or
B	yeah
A	get an e bike
B	yeah
A	I mean it is good here I mean
B	yeah
A	we're in our office
B	yeah
A	but yeah we
B	it's alright
A	it's not that bad
B	no
A	I mean we're not paying for it
B	just as long as it doesn't fall down it's alright
A	yeah
B	I
A	mm
B	I like this it's almost like a bit of a freedom
A	mm
B	yeah I like it here cos of that
A	mm
B	but then our landlady
A	no she's a witch
B	mm

B	mm
A	but I mean we agreed to stay and yeah okay I've accepted that that's
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna get all arsey with her
B	no let's
