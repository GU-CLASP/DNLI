A	I was assured the boat was in good nick and they had charts and had everything else because because
B	mm
A	to sail this help sail this boat with
B	but how did you get to
A	erm flew we flew out there he got us a visa and everything
B	mm very difficult to get a visa
A	anyway I don't know what pretext we got it on I I went to
B	mm yeah but you were there anyway
A	yeah and that was a a real opener actually and I'm not particularly enthralled with
B	no no no
A	obviously very rich
B	right
A	but a lot of poverty there as well
B	mm
A	but the anyway erm we spend three days in
C	what sort of boat you talking about?
A	sailing boat with an engine
C	right
A	it's fifty foot long
C	right
A	eh
C	masts?
A	yes two masts ketch rigged erm
C	right
A	erm eh anyway
C	what's? wooden hull or?
A	eh yes yeah it was a Norwegian design
C	right mm
A	with a pointed stern fortunately which is quite good in rough seas
C	was that recently made or?
A	yes
C	mm ah alright okay
A	and he fitted it all out and this is where this
C	mm right
A	eh anyway we had to sail this boat out I mean it was a nightmare from start to finish cos you have to go out to
B	right
A	so we knew we were knackered for going into
C	ah
A	but equally he hadn't got any charts anywhere else
C	mm
A	we had a glorified A A map
A	you know of the
A	I mean well the
B	mm true
C	oh
A	so if we were in daylight
C	gosh
A	yeah we had and of course when we went I forget it was October I think November the prevailing wind is north
C	mm
A	so it's smack down the
C	mm
B	good lord
A	the first I mean they were
A	so I I I I was sailing his boat virtually single handedly tacking up the bloody
B	yeah
A	I didn't have to to keep running up the
C	no
B	oh no
A	we had to eat it in about two days cook it and ah it was a nightmare
B	oh god
A	and and the water pump packed in as well
A	no no fresh water and we couldn't use the engine very much
B	got fish in the sea
A	yeah and they argue like in fact they almost came to blows at one time and and the worst
C	how many people were on the boat?
A	three of us
C	just the three?
A	yeah
C	so it was you and those two?
A	yes and I was trying to keep them apart and they were arguing about this bloody generator cos the generator belts kept going
A	so we were we could see that because we did that bit in daylight
C	oh right
C	so so did you go left or right?
A	well we went left you see to start with but then the the wind blew up and there was a tremendous storm
A	and it and there's oil rigs up there
C	oh my god
A	and there's islands and things but they're not really marked and we didn't have a thing any er
C	charts charts
A	any charts so we're so we're you know no radar nothing like that so we're knackered so the first night in this storm we decided to stay around this oil rig which was
C	mm good landmark or seamark yeah
A	so we just tacked back and forth all night
A	there was this this this American this American chap American chap yeah
C	oh great so we can rely on you
A	so anyway by morning we could see these huge waves coming down I think you know it's hopeless in a boat we can't go on further like this we've got to go and find shelter so
C	yeah
A	we decided to go back down again and go back up the
C	oh
A	and the engine was on the blink we were
C	mm
A	and eh but it was getting really bad and smoke coming out of it and well the heat heat thing was going up
A	so so
C	mm
A	it'll go we'll take we'll go to Israel
C	mm
C	mm mm yeah
A	and the rest is
C	mm mm
A	and so
A	it was about the size of that wall there
C	oh my goodness
A	and he hoisted it up the back of the boat which is you never ever do I mean you well you shouldn't anyway but he he
E	what was he on? what was he
A	well I don't know I don't know but anyway he did but what we didn't know it was the same time that the
A	they had a big bombing campaign
B	can't believe it
A	so we were limping up and and I said look this engine is really dodgy you know and I was down below deck trying to sort of look at this and nurse it and see if I could find any more oil anywhere to shove in
C	mm
A	and and suddenly they said there's something outside here we can hear noises there's boats around going around us
B	oh my god
A	you could see in reflected glare all these blokes with coats on
C	no
A	yeah and eh started realised well they spoke English actually very good English
C	oh my god
A	christ
A	we're coming alongside nobody move
A	so
C	yeah
A	and said you know what's happening? what are you doing?
B	mm yeah
A	he said well look at your sump he said it's full of oil he said your
B	yeah
A	so you know you're not we'll we'll take you in we'll tow you
A	where are you from?
B	right right yeah
A	and he was really really quite good he said look I've got to keep you under arrest you're going to be under arrest for thirty-six hours
A	but after we'd been under arrest for about twenty-four hours and they'd taken our passports off us and everything erm he came back and he said have you got any smarter clothes? I said well yeah we have actually
E	what were you wearing?
A	we'd been living on we'd been living on
C	oh my god
A	that was all we all we got green beans and
B	no? yeah
A	anyway we went to meet this bloke
B	where was that?
C	oh right
A	and he'd seen our passports
C	yeah
A	from that area
B	oh I see
A	so he was talking about the area to us
B	yeah
A	and he'd obviously done background checks on us by that time
C	yeah quite thoroughly I would think
A	and he said look I'm terribly sorry you've been inconvenienced like this you know and
B	mm
A	but he said really you're your engine the boat has had it you're not going to go anywhere
A	so
E	whose boat was it?
A	well it's this
C	I was going to say I bet it was the
A	so he was trying we were trying to
B	well you were quite a long way from home
A	he said we would like we would like you to be guests of the to make up for the all the inconvenience you've had you've been under arrest got to keep you under house guard for another twelve hours but after that we'd like to make up to you and and take you and show you our wonderful country
C	wow
A	so we did and we had we went round in the Land Rover they used for the queen
B	right
A	we had this officer who'd arrested us who was a lovely chap eh and and eh he took us round yeah he took us round and he took us to
B	mm
A	and he took us to eh
A	and it he was he was wonderful we met all these
C	god you lucky thing
A	and it was absolutely fantastic we had a first class trip
B	what a privilege
A	yeah and it was a lovely chap and he said we got to know him quite well and he said look is eh? do you do you live anywhere near
C	oh
A	there's a headquarters there for for us coast guards
B	yeah
A	are you anywhere? cos we'll be there for a fortnight and we're free on the middle weekend right we'll come and fetch you so we did and
A	made a fantastic weekend we took him round the area showed him everything
C	yeah
A	and the one bloke he didn't speak English but
C	oh right
A	well what do you do with the apples? we make fruit juice with them
A	we'll show I took I took him down to
C	oh right yeah
A	here's what we do with apples
A	because we realised they liked a drink but they didn't have a chance of a drink
C	oh right yeah
A	so
C	oh my goodness
A	so they were but they had a wonderful time and we kept in touch over the years
C	I'll bet they did god
B	but you were in a lot of danger then
A	we were at the time because because it was we were sitting round this table and one of the blokes actually did speak who spoke English so
C	potentially could've been very risky couldn't it? mm
A	and she says look my husband's been telling me that you know you had a gun on him and you were going to you know
B	yeah
A	threaten to shoot you wouldn't have shot would you? he said of course I would've shot him that's my job if he hadn't done what he was told I would've shot him
C	laugh oh my god
A	because you can't mess around when you're in
C	no no
A	so she was a bit more respectful after that
C	god
B	but you're also in danger from the elements I mean you know
A	oh yes yes yeah absolutely
B	fantastic trip but quite dangerous
A	yeah
C	do you know
E	so what
A	well
B	what? from
A	from
B	from
A	yeah
E	so what happened to the boat?
A	it's still there as far as I know
E	and the
A	the American came up to me actually and he said
B	what? the boat's still there and the
A	I I I I think I did correspond with him I I think he might have got got it mended and got somebody else to take it round for him but he said oh
B	no no mm how funny
A	so but erm it was an interesting trip
A	but of course we hadn't been in touch we hadn't been in touch cos we I think maybe I did have a mobile phone
E	but
A	yes yeah because they we couldn't let them know where we were what had happened course we couldn't
C	no mobile phones in them days
A	and I think we we phoned from the airport moments before we got on the plane
E	she must have wondered what on earth?
A	but no I mean it was an interesting trip but it it it taught me that you know I'm very careful who I sail with these days
C	yeah
A	so people say oh come sailing
C	you check them out well friends of ours have just sailed across to
A	mm
B	mm
C	so they had to take it in turns to do listen at night
A	mm
C	to see if they could hear any big birds coming and if they did they had a torch and all they could do was shine the torch on the sail
A	yeah that's a standard yes yes
C	and you think but it takes a long time for a boat you know to manoeuvre around a
B	yeah mm
A	the trouble is that yeah a lot of them don't keep watch though so you've got to always assume that they
C	yeah yeah
E	so what did they think that you were actually doing?
A	well they thought we were a rear attacking force coming into the thing I think
C	the
A	yeah no they thought you know because of it all been kicking off with the
C	god
A	so anyway
B	we're privileged to have you here
E	we love that story don't we?
B	oh I like the story because
A	well how did you how did you get on in in
B	well it's a difficult country it's a very difficult country
A	mm
B	you know erm I was I was single for a year and then I got married on when I came back and you know it's difficult for a woman you know it's difficult enough for a man but for a woman it's impossible
A	yes I mean they don't allow women to drive
E	you you saw beheadings and things
A	yeah
C	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	this guy comes out all bound up and guy with a big sword and not very nice but you you you know you can't really do anything you just don't know what's going on cos I I was only there like a week and this was the I was just out for a walk and I thought oh well what's going here there's a big fuss you know
A	no mm mm yeah
B	and I was sort of pushed to the front
A	well I I'd found out about that because you know what's her name
C	oh
A	right in front of her she young girl
B	mm and you see hands sort of dangling you know
A	yes yes
C	really?
A	yes yeah
A	and she said oh
B	yeah you sort of after a while you kind of accept things a bit it's odd isn't it? you know you're there you've got a contract you've got to teach
A	mm yes
B	so you stay and you know you just put up with things and it it you know you just choosing after a while not to go to these things you know?
A	yeah I mean
B	erm it's a very odd society very odd society
A	to
C	oh right
A	it was a little bar and they made their own booze and they
B	sadiki's my friend I'm I
C	no sudoku?
A	did you? well it's bloody awful stuff though they do seven up and sadiki
B	well it's not too bad if you run it five times
B	it's like vodka if you run it three times it's awful cos you can taste the yeast if you run it five times it's like Smirnoff
A	but all these blokes thought it was wonderful you know they
B	how can you remember sadiki? I mean that's that's
A	well once you've drunk sadiki you don't
B	do you know what it means? sadiki?
A	no I haven't a clue
B	it means my friend
A	oh does it?
B	sadiki is friend and sadiki is my I I could've been in prison for years ten years thrown away the key I was in really dangerous situation
E	but you could've been
C	it's like it's like that atrocious really?
B	but you know I was twenty-four twenty-three twenty-four
C	you take the risks don't you?
B	I took the risk
C	what's that eh
B	oh that's
A	oh no recina
C	the Greek wine
A	that's awful it tastes like paraffin
B	yeah
A	you've got this sort of
C	I remember the first night we we we went we arrived in in in
C	it was
A	was that before or after you'd been drinking?
C	that was before believe it or not and then we'd looked in the erm we'd looked in the travel book and it recommended this wonderful place to go and have breakfast and we slept in the car outside this place till it opened up it opened up and we went in and we had breakfast and we thought how would this possibly have got into some guidebook as being recommended for breakfast?
C	anyway we had the breakfast it was like got the slices of bread and it was like lard to put on the bread and
C	we were in the wrong place but we then drove through the mountains this is from the sea we went into this little village and as it was dark it was night time and as we drove through the village there were shops with the most bizarre nature it was like ski shops and and we thought why would you have a ski shop in
E	whereabouts were you then?
C	can't remember where it was it was it was in the
C	yeah and we we we we got in we got into this little restaurant you know and we said we'd have a bottle of the local wine
A	yeah
C	anyway we eventually acquired a taste as you do and then this other group of four
A	yeah it gets better as you drink more
C	they ordered the local wine they all drink and went oh my goodness what is this? exactly the same as
A	yeah terrible
E	but it's changed now you
C	is it? what is
E	we had the most amazing erm
B	is it the wood in the barrels?
E	it's resonating
C	yeah yeah
A	yes yeah yeah
E	right exactly exactly
B	but recently the other last week whenever we were there that white wine
B	yeah it was it was quite smooth one of the wines we had
A	right well the cheap wine there was called domestico or something
E	yeah
A	but it always put me off it was a bit like domestos so I I
C	yeah cleaned the drains with that
E	that's expensive
A	I quite
E	mm
A	but only out in
E	mm no it's horrible sunset ouzos
B	well
A	but sitting out
C	no but it's
A	and what's the

E	drink?
A	the the the one on from ouzo
C	you'll have a
A	of ouzo
E	yeah I
C	limoncello

E	erm well eh we had it what was it called? that was served where we were it wasn't ouzo they were serving all the time
A	it's it's it's it's more potent than ouzo
unknown_female	mm
E	yeah
E	oh raki
A	raki that's it
E	oh raki yeah that's
E	but there was another one that we were supposed to drink this time I can't remember what it was called
A	mm
E	oh dear
A	the amazing thing I found with being in in
A	but they're all lovely people really but as soon as you know
E	mm
C	yeah
A	and every time we've been there's been an incident and you've got all the
C	yeah
E	when you say an incident do you mean an incident with you? or just an actual incident
A	no no no no no no no somebody somebody's done something and and but I mean there's jet planes jet planes
E	oh right
B	I think you invite trouble
A	not it's usually I'm better when my wife's there actually it doesn't tend to happen quite so much when she is there
C	ah right yeah do you moderate the amount of alcohol
A	well no well we we didn't have any in in in
A	that was another thing the wind was blowing like hell and we couldn't get out so we we waited and the customs came on board and I'd taken all my dental magazines
E	mm
A	to read
C	what?
A	no because because they you know I thought I'm going to be stuck on this boat for you know well I thought look I've got to catch up on some of these things postgraduate stuff and on the one there was an article about syphilis because syphilis can affect the teeth and so on
A	but it but it did have blown up pictures of genitalia because you can get these syphilitic
B	mm
C	right right
B	really?
A	and it just so happened that this bloke comes on board what are those? what are those magazines? dental magazines

A	cos the wind was we we were
E	the original trip?
A	yes the original trip yeah yeah and eventually he managed to show him all these dental magazines and that he was a
C	yeah
A	and they they saw reason really
B	mm god it's a bit of a stretch though from teeth to genitalia
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah no you'd be surprised what affects it what dentists can pick up
B	really?
A	well in more in more ways than one
C	like like that this is this won't hurt but there'll just be a slight prick
C	right okay hey I'm going to have to go
A	and
E	well I'll give you both a lift
A	oh don't be so silly
