A	cos I've got an afternoon around museums and
B	did we do that one?
A	yeah
B	weren't we heading
A	that was a really nice day
B	weren't we heading somewhere that way
A	you went we went to look at those erm shipping posters in the maritime museum
B	that was a bit of a let-down that wasn't it?
A	yeah but
A	yeah I know I know I was I told you I was there the other day didn't I?
B	did you actually have a look round the museum?
A	no not really I was a bit eager to get out it's er
B	why why do they have meetings there? is there is there conference rooms?
A	yeah on the fourth floor there there's a café and then behind the café there's like a
B	yeah
A	they did lunch which was nice
B	yeah
A	saying don't use the NHS cos they're rubbish come to us instead and obviously they were preaching to their most like ninety percent of the audience who were
B	yeah
A	but you know free lunch cost me six quid to park there though mind
B	that's how much it cost to park there?
A	park there for three hours cost six pound
B	in our on on
A	I know it
B	they
A	the only reason I parked there cos I
B	yeah
A	yeah so what do you want to buy?
B	an electric toothbrush
A	I saw I've saved the page on the thing if you want to
B	the the Kindle?
A	the iPad
B	oh yeah erm I think I just wanna get this one it's the cheapest one it's got good
A	yeah
B	Braun Oral B Vitality Precision
A	does it come with spare heads? how much are the heads? is it like a printer it's cheap to buy the actual toothbrush but the replaceable brushes are really expensive?
B	ah they're not soft are they?
A	I don't know but I'm just thinking is that a way they make their money? cos normally electric toothbrushes are quite expensive aren't they? does it have a buy together with oh no you
B	yeah
A	technically that would last you two years
B	so I don't need a shaver adapter do I? or do I? I haven't got one of them
A	I've got one of them
B	have you? to plug stuff in?
A	yeah
B	so I don't really need that set do I for the thirty-two pounds?
A	no
B	just buy batteries
A	right now do you?
B	no
A	I would say
B	oh I didn't know there's so much to toothbrush toothbrushes
B	I had
A	why what's that sensitive mode? daily clean mode with three D movement what?
B	that would go around the tooth
A	oh
B	so I think I think my one
A	I don't like them the they scare me a bit
A	sounds a bit scary
B	what do you want it what do you want it to do?
A	I I you have to be careful with them cos someone told me I can't remember who it was that they're actually you have to be quite careful and sometimes they can be bad for your teeth cos they're a bit too
B	aggressive
A	harsh and it takes like a layer off your teeth
B	and
A	to
B	I were talking about er yeah was it
A	it is the dentist
B	cos I couldn't remember the girl's name and his said who was it and I said and he said
A	oh it wasn't
B	no but she was the
A	but she was in your
A	yes cos he drank mouthwash er or he had a cup of coffee after his mouthwash
B	so it like
B	it weakens your enamel
A	yeah
B	okay one rechargeable toothbrush so I won't be bleaching my mouth any more
A	so scared of what?
B	this morning when I tasted bleach on my thing
A	oh
B	it's a bit like ah
B	my teeth?
B	they er they've never looked better
B	my oesophagus
B	my oesophagus is somewhat hurting
B	yeah
A	for your wish list?
B	I have
A	put it on your wish list
B	the thing is is that it
B	the new
A	didn't even know they're still going
B	the thing is a lot of the stuff they recommend I've
A	yeah
A	eighteen ninety-nine
B	yeah but this is that's
A	oh that's really creepy
B	what the
A	Swans
B	Swans? they're a bit of a creepy band
A	I was looking at slightly more boring
B	don't
A	in a toothbrush holder can you?
B	don't let that stop you if you need to er
A	shall I show you what I was looking at?
B	yeah
A	ten pounds in John Lewis for a toothbrush holder
B	I nearly bought a self-help book today
A	did you? bought a self-help book?
B	it was I don't know what it was that I it was just about
A	mm
B	and I think I cos I was like I was in the train station and I was feeling a bit anxious
A	no it's just John Lewis tulip
B	how much do they cost?
A	the thing on its own is ten pound
B	why?
A	put it on our wedding list
B	that's not the only reason to get married
A	well it's a pretty good reason
B	you're so cynical
B	that's
B	cos I know it would only be for the gifts
B	not for love
A	I love you
B	I know
A	you know I do just be an added bonus if we get a load of presents
B	I was speaking to
A	yeah
B	er he he travelled around and
A	yeah
B	and he just said he said
A	mm
B	he's he's really not like about about like the interiors of places like he's
A	I think he'd more er he is more than you he does have an opinion I remember them arguing over the
B	really?
A	cos
B	oh
A	I remember
B	each to their own
B	but erm but it well he but he said I think when it came to furniture and stuff he just said you know
A	mm
B	and you're gonna fill your
A	yeah
B	unless you've got bags of money
A	no not straight away
B	yeah
A	so say then I'd replace
B	yeah
A	so even if you were just completely mish-mashed for a while
B	mm
A	cos obviously very rarely can you afford to buy
B	yeah it's true
A	mm
B	so is that where you'd live then?
A	I dunno really
B	yeah
A	to see her like you know once a week and
B	it's on it's on the balance of things I mean
A	yeah
B	but now
A	I just feel like I'm always travelling over to
B	I'm but I'm starting to feel a bit now like I mean obviously I've got I mean er I'm I'm bearing in I've got
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but I'm gonna do that that's definitely what I'm gonna do I've got nothing else to do tomorrow actually
A	yeah
B	I'll be back I'll be back by dinner time though
A	mm don't worry
B	erm
A	stay for tea at your mum's if you want
B	no
B	don't want don't want turkey burgers
A	turkey dinosaurs
B	turkey dinosaurs
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I haven't seen her in so long
A	well this is it and like
B	yoga?
A	you know just stupid things I know that's really daft but it's like
B	but you'd like to go with her?
A	I could go with her or
B	yeah
A	you know we could ah I dunno I just
B	yeah I
A	I dunno what it is really
B	I get it I'm starting to feel a bit the same
A	then I could just feel like everybody you know all my friends well I say all
B	but but you know er
A	but you know I don't have any friends in
B	yeah but I mean I'm I'm the same
A	you know like the majority of my
B	the thing is as well I suppose is that
A	mm
B	or came over for you know like on Saturdays if I wanna watch the match over here
A	mm
B	I watch the match
A	the only thing is the price of train tickets now isn't it?
B	that would be
A	probably
B	there's and there's no way round it er if you drive it's gonna be more expensive
A	mm
B	cos of parking erm
A	yeah
B	the only way round it would be to get the bus the four ten
A	I bet that's very expensive though isn't it?
B	but I think it's quicker
A	do you think?
B	I think I think it would be quicker to get the four ten from
A	maybe
B	because if you think about the route it goes there's not much traffic even of a morning there wouldn't be much traffic
A	no probably not
B	er
A	by the time you
B	well I guess what I'm saying is it wouldn't be it wouldn't be ridiculously
A	and we couldn't afford
B	no
A	you're gonna get a new job soon anyway
B	well I happen to know two people who are renting a room in
A	who?
B	mum and dad
A	oh
B	yeah no I'm starting to
A	yeah
B	but that
A	yeah that's still just as far as here really
B	mm
A	well it kind of is it's a good twenty minutes to from
B	mm
A	well yeah
B	I dunno though you know saying that though like obviously I've been really busy the past few months but I know what'll happen as soon as say I mean
A	no no of course not
B	but
A	yeah
B	oh it'll be a bit better and things like that and oh you know I I could I could see this person see that person but inevitably as soon as you move home
A	yeah
B	my my mum my dad's always out so I never see my dad anyway my mum's always in bed like
A	mm
B	I'm never gonna I'm not gonna see any of them three am I like
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	I can you can go into town or you can you know
A	yeah yeah there's stuff stuff to do
B	or me and you can go go out for some food or go for a walk in the park
A	yeah
B	just little things like that that you
A	I love going for a walk in the park after work
B	well I should we should try and do it before it gets really cold
A	yeah we should cos
B	certainly am
A	I'm looking forward to Christmas though
B	I haven't I just I feel I just really feel like I wanna get
A	mm
B	you know I'll say about
A	yeah well the next sort of month or so will be
B	end of discussion
B	I
A	mm
B	if if that happens
A	well I'll be really sad if I don't get an interview and I think I really deserve an interview
B	it's
A	but
B	you never know with these things do you any more
A	exactly
B	it's
A	mm
B	but I was just sort of saying this to
A	yeah
B	I won't be able to
A	no I know
B	erm
A	I'm gonna do hen party things
B	while you're there?
A	yeah
B	what do you mean like just on your own
A	bit mad though
B	like wearing a sash?
B	woo
B	who's that weird girl? erm
A	there's a few things like I wanna get like maps for everyone so I need to like go into like a tourist information or something
B	er what
A	just wanna have a wander round
B	what would you do?
A	and
B	er how would you like what would you do just stay there one night?
A	yeah I'd have to
B	where would you stay?
A	I'd
B	that's gonna be really expensive
A	I know I was thinking of going on cos you know with that
B	I wouldn't drive
A	no you know if we booked that one for
B	we need to cancel that don't we?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then it feels a little bit half of me thinks oh you're just tempting fate but I think well no I'm not really am I
B	or like booking a day off work
A	that's just superstition
A	yeah so I think if I just book it then
B	mm
A	I can't book my train tickets and that's gonna cost me a fortune
B	yeah
A	erm because they only give you two weeks' notice or something I mean I had a look the other day and it was about sixteen quid return
B	to
A	yeah eight pound sixty single each way
B	with a rail card?
A	yeah
B	how?
A	I don't know
B	are you sure?
A	yeah
B	are you sure that wasn't to get on the train?
A	that was mid-week erm but I will be going mid-week so
B	that's cor that's really good that
A	I know it's amazing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	cos I knew it was fairly cheap if you book it three months in advance because that's what I plan to do for the hen do but
B	mm
A	obviously I won't have the luxury of booking three months in advance so
B	and if you book in advance you know when
A	yeah
B	and we could book a few in advance so like
A	exactly
B	so like we we could sort of have planned weekends home
A	planned weekends erm
B	no
A	all that way
B	yeah it just erm
A	well I don't know
B	I mean I mean the thing is is like even if you don't get an interview I mean it doesn't change much really but I just feel like I've gotta make I just feel that we've got to make some kind of decisions about things and
A	yeah I feel like you've gotta you've got to try and get some plans together yourself really
B	yeah
A	so I don't feel like I'm dictating everything
B	that's what
A	yeah
B	I'm not too fussed
A	are you gonna apply for your masters?
B	yeah
A	this week?
B	I wanted to and then I told you didn't I like it it it said apply for two thousand and fifteen but the form I've I've started to fill in
A	oh
B	I don't wanna complete a form and then it'll be like oh sorry there was an error on that one do it all again
A	yeah
B	but I suppose I mean I suppose I can just complete the form and then copy and paste it
A	you can copy and paste yeah like the personal statement-y bit is there that personal do they ask for a personal statement?
B	yeah of course yeah
A	yeah so
B	yeah there's lots there's lots there and
A	yeah

A	well yeah
B	as as

B	but I thought he might be a bit offended and then I wasn't sure whether you know
A	oh yeah
B	I mean presumably

B	what was your favourite biscuit when you were a kid?
A	erm
B	mm Twix is awesome
A	mm
B	cos he said about cos
B	and he yeah cos I was saying about how I I really understand why people don't like the idea of it and then we get onto like yeah things with milk and stuff you know
B	obviously
A	the obviously place to go with that conversation
B	I was pretty drunk at the time
B	erm and then
B	and I was like yes
A	that's a good pleasure
B	they are both of my favourite things
A	mm
B	yeah it's weird isn't it?
A	yep mm
B	let's play a game let's play
A	okay
B	let's play let's make a list of our Christmas presents now
B	okay you can choose it
A	no I it's on our wish list just it'll come on my wish list
B	oh now it's in
A	no I want a fancy one go and er search my wish list that one
B	this one?
A	yeah
B	you know the rule with kitchen appliances or kitchen just is is that
A	what is
B	for every one you buy you have to throw one away
B	so so
A	I haven't got a flour sifter
B	exactly so you'll have to
A	so I can't throw one away
B	er how how attached are you to the pans cos they'll have to go
A	all three I'll probably
B	which one?
A	your nan's one
B	that's horrible
B	and that is a better quality pan than anything
A	yes
B	else we've got
A	it is we'll throw the one pound fifty-one away from Asda I would like that and the erm icing sugar shaker
B	I don't like it it looks a bit it's like
A	don't you like it?
B	it's bit pastiche
A	what does pastiche mean?
B	I'm not quite sure I just use words like that all the time
B	pastiche
A	the person on the recorder will be like mm incorrect use of pastiche
B	yeah
B	I hope I hope no-one judges that
B	no I think I believe pastiche is like is when you take you take like an old style of something
A	and do it badly
B	no cos that's parody
A	mm but parody is like a comedy isn't it?
B	no
A	if you're parodying something
B	yeah so like
A	you're looking at comic effect
B	so it's so it's so it's without irony so like
A	okay
B	but this
A	yeah
B	retro styling
A	but I don't I like I like the the motion of it the I like the gadget
B	but that's gonna oh
A	that's okay you don't have to if you don't agree then we won't have it in our kitchen
B	well it I think if if if you're one of those people that like love Elvis Presley and loves the fifties and has like
A	what other flour sifters have they got then? have they got any nicer ones?
B	and I'm surprised that there's there's there's more than one in existence
A	oh yeah I've never seen them before
A	mm cos they're boring
B	they're futuristic though
A	mm
B	they're all pretty much the same aren't they apart from that one
A	yeah
B	how about that one? Mrs Anderson's baking three cup stainless steel crank flour sifter
A	mm cos it's still stainless steel
B	so?
A	mm
A	add it
B	see it's all this stuff isn't it?
A	mm
B	power
A	not the measuring cup I think that's a bit pointless
B	yeah
A	set
B	diner style
A	yeah
B	things anything else you want?
A	erm
B	just just say stuff cos I need to get ideas
A	I like the Emma Bridgewater spice jars
B	Emma Bridgewater spice
A	spice tins I think they are
B	spice tins
A	might not have them it's old stock oh that's it so look see and it comes with erm loads of different labels so you can put your own labels on but it doesn't match all
B	does it
A	doesn't
B	does it does it actually have space these look rubbish
A	yeah they don't have they don't match my Orla Kiely so everything has to match
B	feel like I'm in like Revolutionary Road
B	mm
A	yeah no I don't either
B	sort of just
A	I like it to be I like it to erm complement but not like the entire Orla Kiely set
B	but that's what it appeals to doesn't it like sort of people's like
A	mm
B	everything matches and everything looks the same sort of kind of
A	we need to make our seat colours
B	I wanna get a better chair for the office
A	what's wrong with the chair we've got?
B	it's not comfortable
A	isn't it?
B	well
A	well you haven't been in wow look at that
B	what?
A	it's like
B	a hundred
A	a hundred and sixty quid
B	just something a bit more comfortable than the one we've got
A	mm
B	I just can't lean back on it anything like that I feel
A	yeah you feel like you're gonna tip over
B	no I just feel like my back's breaking
A	oh
B	that is nice
A	what colours do they have? I like the cream actually
B	no-one's gonna see it
A	I know but

B	this is your interest isn't it?
A	what?
B	like
A	interior design
A	yeah possibly
A	I'm no good at it though I just copy other people's ideas
B	what psychology?
A	mm
B	but but
A	other people
B	what happens when er you get your house exactly how you want it?
A	then I'll be quite happy then so I probably won't bother looking
B	really?
A	yeah
B	I don't think that's true
A	do you not?
B	no
A	I think I'd be one of those people who'd decorate their house every
B	no cos you'd be skint but
A	yeah
B	dunno it's just just an interest like anything else isn't it?
A	yeah it's just
B	just an expensive
A	wiles away the
B	just just an expensive hobby we've got
A	mm
A	we need to stay in touch with them so we can get their hand-me-downs
B	someone was talking about going to erm if you go to auctions
A	yeah
B	erm I think
A	mm
B	is that expensive?
A	yeah John Lewis is quite expensive
B	but they erm but they got them from an auction or something that to me that sounds really reasonable
A	yeah
B	I
A	sounds like a good idea
B	erm
A	a haunted couch
B	yeah
A	do you think that's how they'll market it? auction haunted couch lot number
B	it was once
A	thirty-one
B	it was one covered in
A	in dead bodies
B	yeah
A	an old woman died on this couch
B	great
A	no it's just people redecorating and getting rid of stuff or downsizing or
B	mm
A	I was looking on that Preloved website
B	what's on it? does that have everything on it?
A	yeah it has all sorts
B	do they have guitars cos maybe I
A	maybe yeah
B	I need a guitar
A	probably
B	no who's who's offering hamsters? do you
A	no-one's offering us hamsters
B	would I be offended?
A	I was like okay do I want hamsters again?
B	erm
A	but
B	no
A	really they are
B	you didn't look after the last two very well
A	they lasted ages they lived to about three for little dwarfy hamsters that's a really good age
B	ah Lennie and George
A	mm
A	I know I don't think I ever had any pictures of them
B	I used to have some on my phone
A	did you?
B	yeah
A	that was a great present or possibly one of the best presents you ever got me for the sheer surprise factor
B	oh what's his name?
A	I know that's who I was trying to think but I can't remember
B	it's like a don't wanna name
B	John Steinbeck characters
A	erm to yeah and you don't bid you just buy
B	you just buy
A	yeah
B	and like
A	like a car it's an internet version of a car boot sale
B	I want a like an actual classical guitar not like a children's one
A	cedar top
B	a hundred and sixty pounds
A	that looks like the furthest possible point from us
B	where's that?
A	erm they had a little thing it was like Portsmouth for something
B	Portsmouth?
A	it's a bit of a long way to go
B	bit of a do it for pickup
A	oh you may like
B	yeah
A	mm
B	like there should be a sort of direct
A	mm
B	it's quite an interesting point but then
A	mm but it does need some regulation really doesn't it?
B	badly
A	your computer's rubbish
B	no it's not
B	it is it's really it's got worse somehow
A	er I dunno just people aren't selling what you want to buy that's all
B	mm
A	your evening of shopping
B	and I can't think of anything that I wanted to buy
A	it's always always the way
B	I'm not buying any more books until I've finished
A	no don't buy any more books we've got no more space for books
B	oh but we've got space for
A	a flour sifter
B	a flour
A	yes we've got space
B	a retro flour sifter
A	got the space for a retro flour sifter
B	what else do can you think of anything we need for here?
A	just stuff that you want to make it more homely for you to make it feel like your home rather than my home
A	a poster you were gonna buy a poster
A	you were gonna buy a like nice art weren't you for the living room
B	I know but now I just don't want to
A	why?
B	cos we'll we'll be out of here in February
A	yeah but we'll be somewhere else
B	true
A	it's not about stuff you need it's about stuff you want you want stuff you want
B	no
A	what about a new bedspread don't you feel the need to buy a new bedspread that you've chosen?
B	no I like this bedspread
A	I like this one too I haggled for this in the
B	I thought you were gonna say like Dar es Salaam or something like
B	like I haggled for this in
B	that's good
A	I always think that shop's going to go bankrupt and it just always seems to have a closing down sale but always keeps just keeps going
B	that's the sort of business strategy in
A	yeah
B	it's like closing down
A	last chance
B	like your last chance to buy
A	it's like The Works it's the
B	yeah
A	end of line stock and
B	I want a jacket
A	mm
B	but that's not like
A	oh
B	on this company?
A	yeah
B	I'd spend it all
B	did you hear about those
A	dad's going to Norway on Friday
B	is he?
A	yeah
B	that'll be good
A	mm
B	pardon?
A	I think we should go on a driving holiday in Norway
B	I'd be more than happy to do that with you
A	you need to learn to drive though and then be comfortable driving on the opposite side of the road up a mountain
B	these jackets are all like six hundred pounds
A	oh my god that one's only two hundred and ninety
B	which one?
A	the winter parka W
B	I'm sure they're very good but it's just the same as like North Face or anything like that
A	mm
B	they're just so expensive
A	they don't look particularly special
B	that's the branding though isn't it like
A	yeah
B	it's
A	I don't like the
B	no I don't really
A	erm
B	er yeah I should what I should do is just pack my bag and go home
A	yeah
B	but I always I just
A	you should
B	I feel too busy on the Thursday I go to work and then I get a bus back here then I get a bus back to town it's just stupid
A	mm
B	erm
A	oh
B	sometimes we call people by their first names
A	his brother's broken up with his girlfriend
B	that's sad
A	yeah
B	I think he said it was
A	oh I know
B	she
A	not taking it too well anyway
B	yeah
A	like he doesn't wanna go on holiday he doesn't wanna move out he doesn't wanna get a job or a life
B	this is what a
A	it seems
A	about
B	yeah
A	mm yeah of course
B	play playing the Sunday league or
A	but I I like painting but I don't sit at home all day every day and refuse to get a job
B	but but but you're not
A	because I like painting
B	but you're not like er you know you're not obsessed with it like and you know I think I tend to think with computer games people who don't play them often thing oh god sitting at home and playing computer games and they picture like a teenage boy in a bedroom with a Lara Croft poster
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah I know but
B	but I know what you mean I'm not saying that's an excuse I mean
B	I probably would
A	I take it back I would
B	erm
A	but you know unless he's pursuing that in some sort of
B	professional
A	yeah way
B	but why does everything always have to be job? like
A	well it doesn't but you can't you've gotta make a choice haven't you you either try and make that your job or you have to get a job and do that in your spare time like you can't choose to not work and live at home with your parents and
B	no
A	not grown up
B	no I agree
A	I feel like
A	like I don't
B	I think I think you're just really like
A	mm no no it's not
B	that sorry just to put that shirt is two hundred and seventy pounds are they having a giraffe?
A	a mountaineer mountaineering shirt number three
B	I'd feel I'd feel really cool in a mountaineering shirt
B	but I'm not paying two hundred and seventy pound
A	you would also feel very poor you'd have no money to go or anywhere and wear the shirt
B	it's made from real foxes
A	oh that's
B	it's not like an ethical company
A	made from foxes entwined with gold thread
A	why I wouldn't
B	well I've lost interest in it
A	well yeah
B	I've just grown out of it really I feel like I don't have the time
B	but
A	really?
A	I thought he always said live apart that's the best way
B	it is that's why they're moving in together next year
B	it was meant to be this year
B	but erm so they've kind of they've agreed so they're gonna move in together in
A	mm
B	erm but he said he said obviously I'm gonna have to get a credit card cos I don't think he can really afford it
A	mm
B	he's on he's on like a he's got a good job erm but he said so he said I'm just gonna get a PlayStation on my credit card as well and pay it off bit by bit
B	erm
A	I'm all about the credit cards
B	really?
A	yeah you know I've got a credit card
B	oh just the stupidest thing
A	no
B	yeah
A	then just paid it off the next month essentially or no a couple of months but it's interest free so now I just move it whenever I have to start paying interest I move the account to somebody else
B	yeah
A	and then what this one I've got now I bought my car insurance on it because I didn't have enough money to buy my car insurance all in one go
B	yeah
A	but if you buy it
B	oh
A	an extra hundred pounds in interest to an insurance company
B	yeah I get it just don't
A	so that's why I do it I don't like I don't go out and buy things I can't afford on it
B	no
A	I'm nearly done
B	do you think I can get away with another grey T-shirt?
A	I don't like that
B	that logo?
A	yeah
B	what's wrong with it?
A	I don't know I think it's a bit how much is thirty-five quid for that?
B	yeah
A	no
B	no I'm not allowed to buy it?
A	it's it's not very nice it's like the most boring logo
B	I know
A	it's horrible
A	for less money than that
B	yeah I don't know I just it's I
A	I I know exactly how you feel because if I had no way of paying that money off then I'd be freaking out but I can afford to pay it I pay that off a hundred pound a month and I know I'll have paid it off before I start paying interest on it
B	mm
A	it's just useful to have for things that you have to buy that are very expensive and you don't have the money right now you know you will in like and spreading over two or three months but to pay it all in one go is just a bit too much
B	yeah
A	so why pay interest on your overdraft when you can put it on a credit card for free?
B	yeah
A	just makes sense you've just gotta be clever with it
B	I just yeah I just lose track of it and then most people I know who have got credit cards always have credit cards plural never just one credit card
A	yeah whereas I just have one
B	I think of it a bit like the woman who swallowed a fly
B	honestly it's like
A	like yeah I know I know
B	they're not doing it
A	most people get out of their depth and then they can't pay what they've bought but that's when people go shopping and put their shopping on a credit card and then they're like oh yeah I'll put it on the credit card I'll put it on the credit card and then they completely lose track of how much they've got on their credit card
B	yeah I dunno I just I
A	yeah I know
B	for myself and and then just worry about it later but I just
A	yeah
B	don't know
A	I mean I would say if you were gonna buy I think if you were gonna buy like a Mac or something
B	mm
A	I'd put that on a credit card
B	well then
A	oh did he?
B	and I said I said how
A	paid for by mummy and daddy like his flat and everything else he owns
B	yeah I said
A	well it's true though
B	I said erm
B	like
A	oh and pay them then
B	well they don't charge interest my parents don't
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and then put a hundred pound each month for the other six months or whatever it would be
B	yeah
A	if you really want it yeah
B	nope there's other things I want
A	exactly
B	as well
B	there's that as well
A	yeah
B	and mum said she hasn't been in touch
A	I'm sure she is she'll be having far too much fun
B	there's just a picture of her today in some kind of vineyard
A	oh right so she is alright then
B	erm
A	what have I been tagged in? something borrowed bridesmaids dresses from the eighties
B	you don't have to wear something borrowed do you?
A	no
B	er
A	I have watched it on the past it's quite funny
B	yeah
A	there's a family on it that own a store in
B	really?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	old couple from
B	yeah
A	haven't seen any of this
B	that's
A	ah
B	really?
A	yeah and just was thinking about it and I was like that would be really cool and I told my mum and she just started laughing and she said well
B	oh right and
A	so that didn't happen
B	I
A	oh no
B	yeah
A	and she was like no
B	it's
A	don't start
A	have a dog and a baby
A	mm
B	and it's just a nice thing I used to love walking the dog
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	having a dog just you're not you're sort of bit of company and you're not on your own and there's kind of a purpose to it
A	yeah
B	you're not just
A	forces you out the door a bit more doesn't it cos you have to take for a walk
B	yeah erm
A	well it's like that pre baby stage isn't it everyone I know who's had a baby recently has had a dog about a year earlier
B	well
A	yeah
B	he said he said it he said it he said it sounds stupid but he said it just gets you used to having to think about
A	something else
B	yeah and something depending on you and things like that so I'd be really I'd I'd like a dog but I just can't picture having one now
A	mm
A	it would be a cruel in a small flat in
B	but not always and then it could be on its
A	yeah
B	it could be on its own like eight till five or something
A	mm it's just too long isn't it?
B	yeah
A	it's cruel
B	what dog would you have if you could have any dog?
A	a Spaniel
B	you can't you've gotta get over like the
A	I know
B	your childhood dog it just would never be the same
A	mm maybe
B	you'd get it and it
A	but Berta's exactly the same as Barney
B	but you'd get one and it just wouldn't be the same
A	mm
B	it's like it's like our friend
A	when she gets the cat
A	yeah I really like Border Collies but they're too they need too much walking they're too lively I don't want anything that smells like your dog or
A	really energetic or would like destroy everything
B	so you're not looking for an animal
B	per se?
A	a stuffed dog would be perfect
B	or or one that
A	a toy
B	like a taxidermy dog
A	yeah what do would you have?
B	erm
A	cos I liked Tish but Tish isn't fluffy she's not cuddly
B	I'd have one that like rescued children from mines
B	I was thinking more of Lassie
A	oh I was thinking of Skippy
B	yeah
B	erm
A	that'd be
B	I've never watched Skippy but I'm starting to think about that cos that's the thing isn't it like
B	I don't have you ever actually seen it?
B	I'm familiar I'm familiar with the theme
A	one episode or something
B	but they
A	maybe an end of
B	but how does a kangaroo save people from
A	he's fallen down the well
B	but how how does the the
A	I don't know
B	it's not the
A	just somehow gets
B	it's not the best animal is it for
A	he just jumps
A	yeah
B	I don't think I have I think it's one of those things that's etched into my brain
A	maybe yeah I made it up in my head
B	yeah
A	mm
B	did I tell you about the
A	mm I don't think so
B	is that a miniature spider crawling on the wall?
A	oh yeah maybe
B	mm
A	cos it means there's bigger ones
B	but it also
A	doesn't it mean there are no bigger ones cos the bigger would have eaten it?
B	no it means that it's recently been born to something to another one
B	that being its first little adventures out of out of the house
A	oh
B	but that's going in the wrong direction cos it will get eaten by that one that lives in the corner
B	the one in the office is really big now
B	yeah
A	you been feeding it?
B	I've been giving it giving it pork scratchings every day
B	it's massive
A	oh god
B	yeah
A	you not killed it?
B	no
A	how do you sit in there with it?
B	cos it's I don't know I I feel a bit bad
A	you
B	I killed one today and I feel a bit bad about it
A	mm
B	I mean
A	it's the time of year though isn't it?
B	well that one's been living there all summer and that's why I feel like I can't kill it it's got it's a bit
A	and now it's your friend
B	it's spent more time in the office than I have
B	it's got a it's got a right to be there
B	it's like squatters' rights or something
B	what's
A	yeah
B	what was I saying before that?
B	yeah well I know it was Skippy the bush kangaroo erm in terms of a dog I'm not sure
A	erm there we are that's what you were talking about
B	maybe like
A	yeah
B	like Jake used to be just kind of fat
B	slow and and
A	an old dog
B	yeah
A	mm
B	arthritic
B	immediately arthritic have to like
A	I like Cocker Spaniels as well
B	mm
A	they're nice
B	don't you?
A	no
B	well isn't what's
A	er a Lhasa Apso
A	that's just mean
B	I love how she hates it though
B	she used to love the
A	but that's a classic case of a really really loved family pet dies so they buy a new dog and then they all just hate it cos it's this horrible mean dog
B	is that Alfie? Alfie's the current dog
A	Alfie is the current dog Ted was the old dog who was a Westie and
B	yeah
A	he was about nineteen or something when he died I think oh no maybe not maybe about how old? must have been fourteen fifteen maybe
B	yeah
A	so he was about seventeen I think
B	ah
A	erm but yeah
B	well the funny thing is is that the number of times I've been round to her house for parties and stuff and the dog's never there
A	yeah
B	it's always shut in the front room away
A	yeah
B	from everyone
A	Alfie
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I hope I've got a shirt for it tomorrow
A	mm have to go and have a look you must I think you will have won't you?
B	perhaps
A	how many did we wash?
B	what?
A	how many did we wash?
B	is it five?
A	then maybe you won't
A	put a wash in tomorrow
B	mm
B	yeah I'm gonna stop this now
