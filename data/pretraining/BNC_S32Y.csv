A	well er it's because you keep it in the drawer
A	there you go
B	yep
A	mm
B	so I think
A	um
B	oh right
A	but I have spoken to her to see what she was thinking about doing over the weekend
B	yep
A	and we were provisionally thinking that as
B	mm
A	maybe we'd all combine it and go round
B	that'd be nice
A	and do something on Saturday night
B	I'd quite like to come
A	mm
B	I'd quite like to come over
A	yeah
B	at some time to see all of you
A	well no cos I thought we could all
B	or you can all come here
A	we could all come here on Sunday
B	fine
A	so if we because Saturday night obviously you're out at the Vigil
B	yeah
A	so if if er I
B	and I can get some food in for Sunday
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sounds okay
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	so
B	well I I'm think I've got this
A	wow
B	where they're going is quite nice
A	mhm
B	there's about five that are being received
A	okay
B	but when we went to the cathedral
A	mhm
B	which I go to every year
A	yeah
B	um
A	ah
B	who were obviously getting instruction er but in a different way
A	mhm
B	Cos obviously the group I go to is for grown-ups
A	yeah
B	um so I don't quite know so
A	yeah
B	er I've got texts on it
A	I did
B	er
A	I tried to ring you earlier
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	when you um
A	look at the phone
B	can you  can you  do it? I can't do it with
A	yeah
B	my left hand
A	so that's what that means
B	oh right
A	that little red er phone symbol
B	is a missed call
A	is a red is a missed call
B	oh okay
A	yeah
B	fine
A	and then you would
B	do you find out what it is?
A	you pull the that down
B	oh right
A	you can see it's me
B	and it tells you
A	and then you can just pull that back up again
B	as you told me the other day you only get the very minimal of information in the box
A	yeah
B	and you have to go on the internet to their website to get the rest
A	it's
B	and of course it's quite difficult
A	I know
B	you don't wanna keep sort of going into the internet every time and
A	I know
B	looking things up
A	it's really annoying
B	it is  it is  annoying
A	if I um
B	have a seat
A	thanks dad
B	er yeah the um the reason I had a er I couldn't do much yesterday was we seem to  we seem to  be going through a stage of things breaking down
A	oh no
B	nanny
B	the fridge first
A	oh no
B	yeah
B	he said well I keep pulling the cord and the light won't go out
A	mm
B	so I said oh right so and he was absolutely right
A	mm
B	er
A	um
B	are you sure?
A	I'll just have this banana
B	um
A	mm
B	um before I bought the place I got er we had a
A	mhm
B	er well not one but a number of people er were electricians because they had to
A	mm
B	and I was so impressed with them
A	mm
B	and he gave it a thorough check over
A	mm
B	and sent me a report
A	oh I remember
B	in that cupboard
A	yeah
B	and what they do now and we had the same issue in
A	mm
B	if you get a surge
A	mm
B	which in er a fuse box have like a fuse
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh right
B	so it has two functions
A	mhm
B	and two it's um er a safety feature
A	mm
B	because you know children often put their fingers in plug points
A	mm
B	er and electrocute themselves
A	mm
B	er whereas when you've got this consumer unit the the
A	mhm
B	the first you know er in a nanosecond the first awareness flicks the switch
A	tut
B	so you can't electrocute yourself
A	nice
B	um
A	mm
B	which turned the light out
A	yeah
B	I took it apart and
A	mm
B	but of course I you know thought well I can just have a go
B	and er I mean basically the spring er cos if you think about it you know when you pull it flicks back up
A	mm
B	there's obviously a spring in it to do that
A	yeah
B	the spring was not only rusty but had broken
A	oh
A	mm
B	the same age as the flat
A	tut
B	so um so I um I tried to sort of cobble that together and I put it all back
A	oh okay
B	it's like like a little can
A	mm
B	as you do it
A	mm
B	I was quite surprised to find that B and Q is open from seven in the morning until
A	mm
B	nine at night
A	blimey
B	so I cycled round to B and Q
A	mm
B	and er I bought the whole new unit
A	oh how annoying
B	and then er it was only a fiver
A	yeah
B	and do it all
A	can you buy the um the pull cord separately? Or do you have to buy a whole new unit?
B	er you can I mean you can  you can  buy er yeah I mean I if
B	er
A	no I was just thinking that in our house because they've got so many people coming and going
B	mm
A	I noticed the other day that the pull cord at the bottom is a completely different colour to er at the top
B	mm
A	Cos people have been disgusting not washing their hands or anything like that
B	mm
A	it's really dirty at the bottom
B	yeah
A	and obviously that's the landlord's responsibility but it'd be quite nice to sort of
B	mm
A	say to her look it's only a couple of quid from B and Q or something
B	yeah
A	can you just have it replaced cos that's disgusting?
B	or or buy it buy the um what you need to do is to work out whether you can connect it
A	mm
B	in into the  into the  thing
A	I think it's one of those ones where where you unscrew it
B	right
A	at the top
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er all of that's live up there
A	yeah
B	mm
A	probably a hundred years old
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't
B	I don't suppose she's replaced it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I mean it's not like a pressing
B	you can replace
A	yeah
B	I'm sure somebody must've um put that in er and the wooden um tut er
A	mm
B	er has a hole inside that's far too big for the um cord
A	tut
B	that's on the new pull switch
A	mm
B	so I've left the plastic one on
A	mm
B	one for the shower unit
A	yeah
B	I've um moved the handle you know the bit you pull
A	mm
B	up
A	oh okay
B	the cord so that when you go in in the dark you can only grab
A	mm
B	you can at shoulder height you can only grab
A	mm
B	if you want  if you want  a shower you have to put your hand
A	oh that's a good idea
B	um
A	just tied it or something
B	in case I think of a better way of doing it I've just tied it up
A	mm
B	just to see how I how it works
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
B	it'll just be you know a foot
A	yeah
B	a foot long
A	no
B	and er you can always replace as I said you can always replace the cord if you
A	mm
B	want to
A	absolutely
A	yeah
B	or a
A	mm
B	he didn't think about the door opening
A	yeah
B	lazy because he just didn't wanna run any more wire across
A	yeah
B	um
A	and
B	mm and charging the full rate
A	yeah
B	and if he did it in all of the houses er all of the flats
A	yeah
B	he'd save himself eighteen metres of wire
A	yeah
B	um so um I don't know what it was
A	yeah
B	and to the the side of the door
A	mm
B	which opens
A	yeah
B	not the side of the door where the hinge is
B	so you can't really
A	stupid
B	but I've seen that often
A	right
B	and of
A	mm
B	because people you know wanted to use space in a different way
A	yeah
B	of course there's you know that's just one of those things
A	mm
B	rewire that light
A	absolutely
B	but um sometimes in new houses er or even in er older places like this I've seen it you know where quite clearly er it's been like that from the word go
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	and er the way they  the way they  should work er is that um when you um when you turn them on you do that
A	yeah
B	okay? And when you turn them off you do that
A	yeah
B	and it's it's er you know you have to sort of remember
A	it's counter-intuitive
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	which way you're doing
B	instead of a left and a right
A	yeah
B	and again you know is that stupidity of the plumber? Is it laziness of the plumber? Or er did they do it deliberately cos they didn't wanna open another box of taps?
A	mm
B	and they had two left-hand ones
A	yeah
B	be alright
A	they won't care
B	so yeah so um so I was out er and there was you know the um Holy Thursday service at seven thirty last night
A	oh it's an evening service?
B	yeah
A	oh blimey
B	and er a bit later actually cos I called in at Tesco's on on the way back
A	mm
B	what time is it?
A	mm
B	is it eleven o'clock or is it?
A	one o'clock
B	one o'clock
A	this was the photo I was trying to send you
B	oh right
A	I was in Tesco's yesterday
B	oh right
B	is that a little hint is it?
A	it's massive
A	I know
B	so what what actual size are the are is the actual bit you eat then?
A	I don't know
B	is it like that? Is it like a football is it?
A	it's it's probably tiny
B	oh
A	well you know they do little eggs?
B	yeah
A	like Cream Eggs
B	yeah
A	they do eggs that size
B	mm
A	that's probably like that I suppose
B	oh right
A	funny time of it so she prefers to just drive
B	is she alright is she? Apart from  apart from  that
A	she's alright
B	is he back in
A	tut
B	oh yeah
A	the woman who stole his
B	sort of
A	his second wife who stole all his money
B	mm
A	he's got some sort of detached retina
B	oh dear
A	so he came back from Thailand to have the operation
B	mm
A	but hadn't really communicated that to anybody
B	mm
A	and he was really um he turned up at the house and was shouting at
B	really?
A	all this sort of stuff
B	mm
A	that is the first time they've seen him so irate and so sort of manic and
B	why why was he shouting at them? Because
A	he was annoyed that nobody had been er at
B	mm
A	but at the time they didn't know that he was back
A	so no wonder
B	mm
A	yeah
B	nobody's gonna be there are they
A	well apparently he called
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	pit had stolen it or something
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	got in between
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah
A	so
B	sounds very nasty
A	it is
B	mm
A	but he's also got pre-cancerous cells
B	mm
A	they had a
B	mm
A	and they thought that this must be his time
B	yeah
A	now they've come back
B	yeah
A	he's pretty frail and he's an alcoholic and
B	he's probably one of those people who'll live until he's ninety though isn't he
A	yeah
B	I mean er
A	and it's obviously it's just such an emotional rollercoaster for all of them
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah
A	I don't think that's particularly easy
B	well she is very er sort of timid
A	she's not
B	rave at people
A	she's er just that's just not in her character
B	no
A	and um even the next day it was his birthday
A	and
B	mm
A	you know and and
B	mm
A	she'd had him in the house with
B	before he'd started drinking again
A	yeah
B	mm
A	this is just how it's gonna be
B	I think so
A	it's always gonna be like this
B	alcoholics are quite difficult to deal with
A	yeah
B	well anybody that's on a drug dependency is
A	exactly
B	mm
A	there and there's no rule book
B	mm
A	I think she sort of beats herself up about feeling a particular way
B	mm
A	there's no rule book on how you're supposed to feel
B	mm
A	how you're supposed to deal with these things so
B	mm
A	um
B	oh right
A	Cos that's always they always breathe a sigh of relief when he goes
B	where does he go when he goes to Italy then? Where does he stay with his does he have relatives out there?
A	he he goes yeah he must have friends and relatives out there
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	Cos it was on
A	Cos he had to sell the
B	it was on
A	yeah
B	the Italian er
A	and then he got remarried
B	ancestry wasn't it
A	yeah
B	and then he married an another Italian woman
A	he married another Italian woman
B	but but that all er came apart
A	and she took all his money
B	she took all mm
A	which is why he's having to live with
B	mm
A	er although
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	her baptism didn't we
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	William's
B	was she the teacher?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she's really nice
B	I spoke to her for a little while
A	but she's um like most people who are quite well off doesn't spend any money
B	mm
A	and so
B	mm
A	and has got more than enough mouths to feed
B	mm
A	so converted the garage
B	mm
A	and is just generally a bit difficult to live with
B	mm
A	and he's getting on
B	he must be on
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I think
B	mm
A	er yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and they're all living in that house
B	mm
A	and so
B	mm
B	yeah
A	wallpapered now
B	oh yeah
A	three feet high
B	you crawl in
A	yeah
B	wallpaper it?
A	pretty good going
B	oh that's right
A	room?
B	how would you get the steps in there?
A	yeah
B	but um no I was just thinking of you know putting boards across it and thinking that would be difficult enough wouldn't it
A	well it's got boards on the floor
B	yeah but somebody must've done that
A	so which yeah before they moved in
B	oh
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's not been like an exposed
B	oh I see
A	roof space like in
B	mm
A	but it's that size
B	mm
A	um obviously cos it is the roof
B	mm
A	and it's er sloping on one side
B	mm
A	around the outside
B	that cupboard er on
A	yeah
B	go in there and clear it all out before we moved
A	yeah
B	a hundred years of
A	tut
B	mm
A	and they just got shoved in there didn't they
B	mm
A	so they had to all come back out again
B	mm
A	tut
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	I think it's all going okay
B	mm
A	so I think she's quite excited about that
B	mm
A	I tried to probe her but she wasn't giving anything away
B	she's um you might be a terrorist
A	I might be a terrorist
B	mm
A	well that's it's a department within the FCO
B	oh right
A	but it's only temporary
B	but she  she was she  was talking about leaving wasn't she
A	she was
B	mm
A	she works you know if you write to David Cameron?
B	mm
A	it's they answer those letters
B	yeah
A	they put a stamp on it
B	yeah
A	members of the public just write to
B	yeah
A	David Cameron
B	if you write to any member of the government you won't get a personal response cos they're too busy
A	but then you could write to cos if your MP was er William Hague
B	yeah
A	he's also a cabinet member
B	mm
A	so you could write to him
B	mm
A	and then they would pass
B	mm
A	I presume
B	I dunno  I dunno  how that works
A	I don't even know
B	er I still think you'd get a
A	mm
B	er and whether or not um he er would be aware of it I don't know
A	I think he um they just have standard responses
B	mm
A	to David Cameron saying
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	please why aren't you invading Syria? Or what what are you doing to help the situation in Syria?
B	well Syria could kick off in a big way quite soon so she might be busy
A	yep
B	mm
A	and I was saying why don't you just you know start putting stuff in the internal post to number ten
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	even if it was just a proportion of the letters that he was getting through
B	well she's
A	he's not aware of the
B	she's
A	level of
B	she's probably under orders not to do that
A	she can't
B	mm
A	she'd be fired
B	mm
A	but er
B	it's very tight
A	he doesn't know
B	it's all very tightly controlled in the civil service
A	yeah
B	I mean sometimes that's er that's good
A	mm
B	but of course the big danger is that um things get fudged
A	mhm
B	and er and worse
A	mm
B	it's a civil servant making decisions and not an elected politician
A	mhm
B	so um
A	tut
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	for example
B	yeah
A	and you
B	mm
A	writing to her from prison
B	mm
A	which I think is a
B	mm
A	psychiatric prison
B	well
A	isn't it?
B	yeah
A	it's full of crazies
B	both yeah it's both  it's both  a prison and it's for the highest level of
A	mentally disturbed
B	of mentally disturbed er criminals
A	yeah
B	mm
A	saying that
B	I mean er not well
A	but they
B	but because of their
A	can't be
B	mental situation er they're they go to a um they go there instead
A	urgh
B	and er er and are kept in er sort of conditions which are similar to a prison but they would they're also treated for their condition
A	right
B	in a way
A	yeah
B	um
A	lobotomy
B	yeah
A	so um I
B	mm
A	she should get the train at eight thirty and be in by ten
B	mm
A	but sometimes she gets the nine o'clock train
B	mm
A	and gets the tube
B	mm
A	from Victoria
B	mm
A	so it's pretty lazy
B	mm
A	it's very difficult to um fire anybody
B	mm
A	mhm
B	um for er you know
A	mm
B	er and he passed it all onto me when he got fed up with it
A	mm
B	er on er insurance matters
A	okay
B	and basically it was when they privatized the rail er could it used to be a nationalized
A	mm
B	industry
A	mm
B	but when they privatized it in the mid-nineties um every rail company had to have the same type of er what's called legal liability insurance
A	mm
B	as every other rail company whether it was the in those days it used to be Railtrack
A	mm
B	er they're the organization that manage all the lines the signals stations and things like that
A	right
B	but all of the train operators you know like the ones in
A	yeah
A	mm
B	because if there was a major er rail accident er the government wouldn't want to be in a situation where somebody could say ah why are all these people not able to claim? You know
A	but it's privatized industries that you'd be claiming against
B	because there's no insurance
A	though wouldn't you?
B	yeah
A	you'd be claiming against er um the
B	but but because it's a public
A	the National Rail or whatever
B	because it's a public service and it was nationalized and
A	right
B	and then it was privatized
A	yeah
B	um the government would get some flack
A	mm
B	you know or
A	mm
B	going out of business and there was a major crash and it was the rail company's fault and there was no money to pay the um kinda injured people
A	mm
B	and their insurance was either non-existent or defective in some way
A	mm
B	then of course there'd be a national outcry
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	um so my job er a mixed job initially and then my job was to make sure that every rail company had the right sort of cover
A	mm
B	but
A	right
B	head of the department
A	yeah
B	and I knew all his staff
A	mm
B	and she had a er an Eastern European name although she was born in
A	yeah
B	er she had a very strong Northern accent
A	oh really?
B	she was yeah she
A	in what way?
B	well in the
A	just rude?
B	in the sense yeah she was very
A	unhelpful?
B	direct
A	mm
B	er and you know er had no sort of small talk or sense of
A	mm
B	you just over a cup of tea or coffee or something you might but she
A	mm
B	er
A	she always just had her professional face on
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well er Sheldon reminds me of him
B	but but not in the sense of being completely isolated from humanity as Sheldon seems to be
B	but um in being A very intelligent and B very obsessional about things
A	mm
B	and um it wasn't any um coincidence that um he chose er the Rail Regulator's office er as the area he wanted to work in er er in the civil service
A	aw
B	he was just a train expert
A	oh
B	er and he had a team er a young chap er who was the sort of the office junior who sort of worked his way up
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	they had them all over the place
B	the er the government was liable
A	okay
B	I mean the government strangely enough used to buy insurance
A	mm
B	um and that was true but the government bought insurance um er for British Rail
A	tut
A	oh
B	um
B	mm
A	oh wow
B	really weird
A	oh
B	you know like Tower Bridge opens like that?
A	yeah
B	well this had four towers
A	yeah
B	and the whole bridge lifted up as a  as a  as an entity
A	so it would be wet
B	yeah
A	when you drove across?
B	so you had  you had  the road here
A	yeah
B	and when the bridge was down it it was like that
A	yeah
B	but when a boat wanted to come through they
A	oh so they didn't put the
B	and then and it came down again
A	bridge into the water?
B	yeah yeah
A	oh right
B	er really strange
A	very strange
B	and she used to come from there and and I er I mean she was in the office quite early but er she must've left her her home at the crack of dawn
A	she didn't like stay in the city during the week or anything?
B	yeah that's all I  that's all I  knew of her
A	mm
B	um er the first one I dealt with was a senior civil servant
A	mm
B	on X Y and Z
A	mm
B	and er he was a shocker
B	a very fiery tempered guy
A	really?
B	well er yeah I didn't witness it obviously cos er um I
A	mm
B	er when we were having lunch once after we'd finished doing some business and we just um had a bite quick bite to eat
A	mm
B	er injured victims wouldn't be compensated
A	mm
B	so er obviously I let er
A	bloody hell
B	just er completely ignored the insurance department of this rail I mean I can't even remember which rail company it was
B	phoned up the chief executive and got his secretary and said I want to speak to so and so
B	and er er and your company hasn't complied with the insurance
B	and he said well what do you mean by er speaking to my secretary like that? And he said let me tell you something
A	huh
B	is that clear?
A	Good grief
B	and and he was completely within his rights to do it because
A	right
B	it's a legal requirement
A	mm
B	in the way er that the Rail Regulator has set down
A	okay
B	if they don't
A	well at least he was taking it very seriously
B	if the rail companies yeah if the rail companies don't comply with that they break the law
A	okay
B	so er he was just letting him know that er the consequences of breaking the law
A	mm
B	was losing the licence
A	absolutely
B	and er
A	well at least he was on the
B	they er as a result of that they er they got the document on the Regulator's desk the next morning er and the insurance advisors
A	mm
B	to that rail company got the sack
A	really?
B	mm
A	it was that serious?
B	well er
A	yeah
B	being er yanked out of a meeting and shouted at by the
B	by that civil
A	take well
B	without sort of drawing blood somewhere
B	yeah
A	fair enough
B	yeah
A	mm
B	um because there's er again another legal requirement in er under the E European Union laws for competition er all public bodies have to er um put their outsourcing contracts up for um you know um tendering
A	yeah
B	er we lost out
A	tut
B	we lost it after
A	yeah
B	I'd spent so much time on it
A	yeah
B	I mean I think Nick was even though he was very happy for me to deal deal with it all er he'd lost interest at that stage
A	yeah
B	um
A	mm
B	so he knew um I mean he didn't know the he didn't know how much we were getting or anything like that but he er I'm sure he had a rough idea
A	yeah
B	well yeah
A	mm
B	we didn't have a problem
A	mm
B	he lived in
A	tut
B	yeah
A	mm
B	who came from
A	did he have a late night?
B	well I don't know cos I go to bed and leave him here playing his games and things
A	tut
B	so I've never really known
A	mm
B	so I about an hour er I need to go cos I need to get there a bit early as I for the reasons I said that er
A	mm
B	you know it's very crowded on Good Friday
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	huh
B	okay
A	um
B	yeah
A	why you can't
B	yeah
A	Cos she's obviously changed it on hers
B	oh
B	that's what I was gonna ask you
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	is there a way to
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and then settings
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	that's constantly checking things
B	mm
A	like your e-mails and
B	mm
A	it's er accessing the internet all the time
B	mm
A	so disabling background data extends battery life and lowers data use
B	mm
A	so your
B	mm
A	that will be um that won't be used up as quickly
B	right
A	when you're not using that
B	okay
A	Cos it's not accessing your e-mails
B	okay
A	so that's
B	Good
A	so that should make a bit of a difference
B	Good
A	but um
B	that's great
A	tut
B	well I yeah er cos I always have it in my pocket
A	oh it's on vibrate is it?
B	yeah
