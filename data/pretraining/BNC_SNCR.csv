B	I watched TMI
D	TMI
C	yes because I don't wear them in bed
C	I wear my pyjamas
D	yes she does
C	mm I believe this conversation
B	like a mad woman
A	I didn't start it
B	I did
B	bread no
D	not yet I didn't
A	have you decided it's not very nice?
D	I decided it's amazing so I was having my bread first
A	mm right
D	so then I will
A	so what you're going to do is fill yourself on bread first and then not be able to eat the pizza
D	nope I'm only having one slice of bread
A	okay
B	yeah does that mean I can have the other one?
A	I wish we could forward fast forward time
C	mm you can have as many slices of bread as you like
B	oh yay although I don't have enough room on my plate fully yet
D	can you rip these please?
C	can I rip it
B	so I'll have to get munching
D	yeah
C	cut it in half
B	I wish I had I wish I had a sixth sense well I do have I do have a sixth sense but I mean I wish I could like see forward in time
D	yeah would be amazing
C	I think lots of people would like to do that
A	mm
C	what do think they would do it for?
D	mm
B	what do you mean?
C	what do you think they would use their powers for
D	mm probably seeing erm if they got the answers wrong in the spelling test or got the answers wrong on something and then they could see the ways to make an amazing machine and then they could create it do it instead of the person that did it and
C	mm
A	or maybe fast forward time to see what the lottery numbers are and then pick them and win
C	do you know what the lottery is?
B	yeah erm you buy a card and then you write down numbers from one to nine or is it one to ten?
C	so can you is it five numbers?
A	yeah
C	I've never done it
A	five numbers from one to fifty isn't it? or one to forty-nine
B	yeah it's five yeah
C	you've got to choose five numbers
B	yeah
A	and a bonus number
C	and if you and a bonus number? why the bonus number
B	mm
A	that's the bonus ball
C	what is that?
A	you get five numbers and then the bonus ball so if you get all five numbers plus the bonus ball you win
C	so it's six numbers then? that's six numbers then isn't it?
A	er
C	why is it a bonus ball why doesn't it just have six numbers?
A	well because you win a prize for five numbers as well so if you get four numbers and a bonus ball then
C	okay so last week two people in this country won thirty-three million pounds each
B	oh there were some people who through they'd won the lottery but hadn't entered it properly
C	oh no
A	yeah
B	and then they and then they
A	just imagine
B	and then they had won really
C	oh yes they hadn't got their credit or something or I don't know
B	yeah and then they and then they they couldn't afford a lawyer cos they were broke
C	right
B	I think or something like that
C	they just need to admit defeat I think don't they?
A	mm
B	no but the want but they really wanted a case
C	but can the prove that they got the ticket that they did the numbers
B	not sure yet
C	I guess if they're the numbers they chose every single week
A	mm
C	but last week cos it was a very big one
D	yeah yeah
C	cos then they would all carry on with their lives as normal but their lives would just be a little bit easier
D	yeah
C	but thirty-three million your live your lives completely change don't they?
B	mm
A	mm
C	not always for the better
A	if I won thirty-three million pounds
C	you'd buy thirty-one million pounds worth of chocolate spread
A	how do you know these things?
A	I would buy
C	yes?
A	an entire apartment block in
C	right
A	and I would invite friends and family to be able to stay there whenever they wanted but the top one would be mine
C	okay
A	so hard up people hard up friends friends who are struggling
C	mm
A	would be able to have one to themselves
C	forever?
A	forever
C	what if they trashed the place?
A	I'd kick them out but they wouldn't trash the place cos they'd be particular people wouldn't they?
B	yeah
C	what would you guys buy?
A	there'd be a raffle I'd do a raffle so it would be fair raffling off apartments
C	mm
B	well I think if I had three million pounds
A	of course
D	cos you're cos you're soon gonna marry her
A	of course
B	I'd probably
A	and there would be babysitters on hand just in case mummy wanted to pop out and do the hoop for a while
A	which would be downstairs in the in the basement gym which has swimming pool and Jacuzzi
D	I would definitely get
A	and water slides
C	let
B	if I had three million pounds I'd probably add a pole from my room
C	a fireman's pole you're obsessed with fireman's pole in your room aren't you?
A	oh right okay
B	and then that would lead down to the living room
B	so whenever you said
A	wow water slide
C	oh there's a water slide as well
B	yeah there's a water slide erm there's
C	instead of stairs would this be in our house?
B	yeah an escalator to the top
C	but our stairs are very thin
B	well an escalator to go up and a water slide to go down and a pole and a
C	what if it's a cold day though
A	I think we might have to extend the house out into the garden and not have a garden in order for that to happen or what you could do is build it up and have a flat roof and have like a a garden terrace on the top
A	that would be nice wouldn't it?
D	yeah and a swimming pool on and a
A	what on the top as well?
C	and a Jacuzzi
B	well you would like
A	swimming pool and Jacuzzi on the top
D	no in our bedrooms
B	yeah we could like take the roof off and build an extension up and then put the roof on so we can have some
A	I think we might have to possibly buy another house if we want all this
B	mm
C	I know you won't want to do that will you?
B	no
A	now what we could do is we could
B	and pay the or I could pay the neighbours to move out
C	I told you he wouldn't want to move from that house
A	which which ones? which neighbours would you tell to move out?
A	mm
B	yeah
C	oh you are funny I said to
B	that that is true that is true
D	we could have the like slide to go in that house
B	mostly because that house does not exist in
A	yeah
D	if
C	he can
D	and
C	but you're going to be in the one with the swimming pool
D	but he wants but he wants to also go in the other house he can just go
C	he could go and visit the other house couldn't he?
D	I'm going to slide yeah and and then go there for wee yay
C	go there for swimming
A	I can just see
C	yeah
A	strolling up to the
C	come and get my things come and carry my things in
B	ha
C	that would be so cool
A	a little a little chihuahua
C	no
B	is that always what famous people have?
A	what? little chihuahuas?
C	little dogs they do at the moment they do at the moment
A	yeah it's a bit weird really
B	why?
C	I don't know it's just an accessory it's horrible for the dog they kind of put them in their handbags and things
B	ah
A	mm
D	dogs
C	they're not really like dogs are they?
A	no they're like little rats
C	rats
B	they're the smallest breed of dog
C	and they kind of put clothes on them it's all very silly
B	mm although I think there's too many cat videos over the internet
C	you think there's too many cat videos over the internet yeah so do I
B	yeah they're just they're just sleeping
A	my new thing is hedgehogs

A	erm
B	hedgehog video
A	a little hedgehog in the kitchen with a little plastic ball with a bell in it and it's like chasing it round it's really cute
B	aw aw
A	ding a ling and it's making these little noises it's really funny
B	mm
C	have you seen little albino hedgehogs they're cute the white ones
A	yeah they're cute
C	you saw some hedgehogs didn't you? when you were at playgroup?

C	was it
D	erm yeah it was tiny little babies and they were all
A	did you see the little
D	and they were all running around and they were all going wee wee
A	wow
C	and their prickles are soft when they're first born
A	oh
C	so you can stroke their prickles
D	they're going wee wee wee
B	that's the only annoying thing about hedgehogs cos they're all prickly
C	they are that's too protect them isn't it?
B	mm
A	they roll up into little balls so people can't things can't eat them they go ow
B	yeah like
C	but they don't milk is not good for their tummies
A	no
C	so when hedgehogs when people use do leave milk out for them they used to do all sorts of terrible things to their tummies
D	just leave water out for them
C	yes
B	yeah or bread or bread crusts
C	I don't know I wouldn't have thought so cos that's not what they would normally eat in their diet they eat like worms and stuff
A	worms and grubs and insects
B	then
A	my mum gave a a a little hedgehog cat food and it loved it
C	well I suppose it's a carnivore isn't it?

C	meat eating
D	oh
B	mm but not
C	well worms are meat aren't they?
B	they're not yeah they're not really a big carnivore like the T-rex
C	no but you're well you're an omnivore you eat meat and vegetables well
B	though a T-rex would go a big rolly ball I cannot pick this up but I can eat it ow
A	just thinking about that poor little hedgehog being released into the wild and and left on an eternal search for more cat food and knowing it never got any more
C	where did your mum see it?
A	in the garden
A	well it would have come back wouldn't it? if it wanted more cat food?
A	no
A	it never did
C	maybe it killed it
A	don't say that
B	you're making me cry
A	oh don't cry
C	both of you get over it it happened what? twenty-five years ago
B	no
A	something like that
D	I'm not sure what I'm crying of funniness or sadness
C	don't cry it's cos you're tired young man
A	don't cry for me
A	it is a bit isn't it? sorry about that
C	prickly yes prickly like a hedgehog there's a good simile there isn't it?
A	although if you stroke it like this it's not that prickly
B	oh yeah
C	well most prickly are like that when you just do it one way
A	feel it feel it
C	I don't need to feel it

A	so full of love and thoughtfulness
C	I don't want to
C	yeah one way
B	I'll see
A	try the other way
C	right
B	ooh it's prickly that way
A	that was near karma
B	what's karma
A	if you had mentioned fat neck you would have broken that glass
C	explain to
A	well karma is
B	a llama
A	if you do something mean to
C	it's whatever you do
A	it comes back
C	it comes back to you
A	ten like tenfold
C	well apparently

C	so if you're kind kindness will come to you
A	mm you remember that old lady at the locks
B	mm
A	you know she was like mean
C	at
B	yeah
A	and then about twenty well half an hour later we saw her she was she'd fallen over and cracked her head open
B	de de de
