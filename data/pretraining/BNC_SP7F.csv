B	stressing what the hell
A	oh he's
B	is wrong with him?
A	I don't know he's been a right
B	he's like he's like I'm not angry it's like well you are dad there's clearly something wrong
A	yeah he's he's been like that for a while now
B	grumpy bastard
A	he yeah
B	I mean I've seen him only a few weeks ago and he seems
A	he
B	is he going back to his weird obsessiveness about food again?
A	no no he's just being stupid with the
B	oh
A	he's doing four five hundred miles a week
B	shit
A	I know
B	that's a hell of a lot of cycling
A	I know he's doing doing it in hundred mile bursts at the weekend and
B	well he's not I thought he's only he's
A	yeah he did last weekend he did it during the
B	oh did he?
A	at
B	yeah
A	I don't
B	well to be fair though for a sixty like for a nearly sixty-year-old it's
A	is
B	good that he's still
A	is that oh yeah I think it is
B	at least he's still
A	yeah
B	you know like
A	yeah
B	doing it and keeping fit
A	I know but there's a limit to getting thin and getting thin isn't there?
B	yeah yeah he definitely looked a bit skinny
A	yeah
B	oh god yesterday we saw this woman and she was er
A	mm
B	and she was I wouldn't say she was old she just didn't age well if that makes sense
A	yeah
B	like she must have been in maybe her late thirties or early forties
A	mm
B	but she'd aged badly so she looked quite old and she was wearing this she was quite
A	mm
B	so the skirt was really short
A	uhu
B	and you just saw her bum cheeks hanging out
A	oh
B	and like she clearly did not squat or do anything they were like
A	you have to squat at Hydro Hiit
B	do you?
A	yeah
B	how do you squat in water?
A	with difficulty
B	I was gonna say I can imagine
A	we don't do any swimming
B	yeah I know I know I mean I
A	there's absolutely no bloody swimming at all
B	I just don't like the erm I don't like the chlorine in my hair
A	well I this is why I use a Philip Kingsley swim cap
B	yeah
A	and I don't get any chlorine in there cos it seals it
B	every time I go in see
A	well I er he said there's a Boots product or a
B	yeah
A	or Philip Kingsley I said I use the Philip Kingsley he said it's very expensive though isn't it? and I said yeah
B	Philip Kingsley is expensive
A	and it's
B	in general
A	yeah but he said that the erm Boots one is just as good so I thought well I'll use my Philip Kingsley up and then
B	yeah
A	probably go on to Boots but there's a Boots swimming gym shampoo
B	oh yeah?
A	a body wash
B	okay
A	which I use afterwards as well
B	yeah
A	and that gets rid of all the chlorine off your body as well as your hair
B	mm
A	washes it out neutralises it anyway
B	yeah that's cool
A	mm
B	I erm we
A	well
B	yeah but he's more of a hairdresser
A	yeah
B	like he they do men but he's you know he specialises
A	yeah
B	in
A	women
B	women yeah whereas this one looked like an old man shop or
A	well I had well it
B	it looks a bit bobby mum
A	yeah it's supposed to be a bobby but it's erm it looks lovely when I get it
B	oh okay yeah well it's nice
A	I just didn't want bit thick on top
B	yeah
A	but bobby at the you know cut right short
B	yeah
A	no he said don't have it dyed I said why not? he says people are paying thousands to have hair your colour at the moment
B	really? why?
A	grey is the new in thing
B	oh god
A	salt and pepper grey is the new in thing
B	yeah but George Clooney is a silver fox
A	I know I know I mm I don't know if I'm going the right way now
A	oh I'll have to put it in here I'm looking for
A	this is no this is the way I wanna go that
B	that made no sense
B	okay
A	he says yeah he says
A	yeah he said to me he says I'm not trying to erm talk you out of it or anything he says but he says at the moment
B	I've got to go and see him soon
A	yeah
B	my hair is a bit shitty at the bottom
A	don't know oh
B	more horses this is what happens when you live in the countryside
A	oh
B	combine harvester
A	they shouldn't do no
B	doesn't look like they're taking any notice of the fact that there's a car behind you
A	er the fetlocks
B	oh
A	in case they walk across something er bumpy
B	oh I see yeah
A	that's one of the most erm
B	oh okay
A	oh my god what?
A	oh no
B	he's been there for so long
A	mm
B	you can't do anything
A	uhu
B	but he's just crap and he kind of buggered up one of my projects not buggered it like I it's fine but
A	yeah
B	he erm
A	mm
B	and he made a mistake and then I told
A	yeah
B	my week was going and I was like well I had this er
A	mm
B	and then apparently he told her a different story
A	oh
B	and I was like there is no other
A	so she came back to you and said
B	no no no
A	oh
B	I er had a chat with her again this week cos I want to take this product to four a a fourth round of proofs
A	uhu
B	and it that's not normally necessary but in this case it really is because erm
A	mm
B	have given us loads and loads of changes
A	yeah
B	and I want them checked because there was something that I've got massive like well over three hundred changes in this set of proofs and you
A	uhu
B	shouldn't have that many changes
A	yeah
B	in a third set of proofs so
A	yeah
B	erm so I had to I had to chat to her anyway and I was just like well we're slightly behind schedule and she goes yeah I spoke to
A	oh
B	are you lost again?
A	yeah
B	it was the
A	yeah I know it always is
B	or last weekend did you go?
A	erm
B	oh
A	mm
B	you alright?
A	mm
B	you alright? I thought your car had broken again
A	no you have to
B	no
A	you can only start it in neutral gear
B	oh I see that's why but you know that's good because I hate it when you leave my car in
A	no apart from the fact that when
B	mm
A	he said and if
A	thanks dad and then he said erm that he'd er she'd he'd had to call her in the morning cos he wanted
B	yeah
A	she allows him two hundred pounds spending money a a month
B	no you mum this has to be sorted
A	I know it must
B	it's bollocks
A	and he said he said I called her up I said er
B	yeah of course
A	in like a
B	yeah
A	and I said well you don't need to spend a hundred pounds on us he says well you spend a hundred pounds coming up to see me or
B	and another horse good god they're all out today aren't they?
A	yeah so anyway I said
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean the dinner was fifty quid so having spent eighty quid the night before and fifty quid here then he paid for the boat which was eighteen for the three of us
B	that's not bad
A	that's not bad it was six it was an hour and a bit on the boat going up and down the river in
B	yeah
A	learning about
B	no
A	I said dad don't be stupid he said no take it he said
B	oh
A	on principle so I said well I am but I said I'm not taking it every single time I come up and
B	no
A	see you
B	cos you've been coming up to see him for years why suddenly now
A	that's right
B	is it because
A	yeah I think
B	he's trying to make it even or something?
A	yeah I think I think there's a bit of
B	did he ever talk to her about the eight grand?
A	no but that's gonna come up when we erm sort the the
B	yeah you need to sort it you can't
A	no that's
B	yeah I know you said
B	what? she's such a bitch it's his money
A	I know she doesn't
B	if if he wants to write a will where he leaves all his money to charity she can do
A	she can do nothing about it
B	nothing about it anyway so he wants to change it
B	yeah
A	erm he wants to change it and my view is what he should change it to is that you know you lot get a minimum of I thought
B	yeah
A	yeah erm
B	yeah
A	pounds each and if there's anything left at the end of it yeah whatever but he wants to leave a thousand pound to the witnesses as well
B	yeah of course yeah
A	but there isn't gonna
B	he did say that
A	yeah and he wants to leave a thousand pound to Alzheimer's now that'll take him to his twenty-three grand
B	yeah
A	the what what he had left that means there's no money to pay for funerals or whatever
B	oh
A	oh god he's
B	yeah
A	erm throughout his life that to pay for a funeral he's only wants he only wants the cheapest coffin
B	yeah
A	he's gonna be cremated so he doesn't want an expensive coffin
B	whack him in a cardboard box
A	well that's right you know that's the new that's the new thing
B	yeah
A	is the cardboard
B	no oh god
A	you know
B	not at all
A	that'll do
B	how much does he he has like a hundred thousand
A	yeah
B	at the moment or something?
A	but what
B	oh he's
A	he's got that now he's yeah
B	yeah
A	so what I my view is is when we come to reading the will I they'll say is there any other any other things left? and I'll say yes there's ten thousand pounds which was paid into
B	you need proof though you need proof of that
A	I've got proof of it
B	good
A	I've got proof of it
B	as long as you have
A	cos she's got she's got the payment into her account hasn't she?
B	yeah but er no but as long no but you need that proof cos she can just destroy that
B	okay
A	and she can't destroy that bank transaction so
B	well as long as you get
A	and I will just turn around and say you know
B	technically she'd have to prove that you she didn't have it didn't she?
A	yeah she'd have to prove she didn't have it
B	yeah
A	but my view my view is that what she should do is erm I'll just say well I'll take four-and-a-half thousand pounds extra onto the
A	so
B	does grandad not have his bank card then? I thought
A	no no
B	she threw it at him
A	she gives now she gives it to
B	how did she get it back?
A	I don't know but anyway she's got it back and
B	this this situation is bollocks it's
A	I know it is and I
B	it's he but he's
A	but she brought him up some more money
B	she's such a skank
A	I
B	uh
A	I know she is I I absolutely loathe her I really do
B	she's such a
A	yeah
B	why are you so?
A	yeah why not?
B	she treats it she just wants his money and it's so
A	I know
B	sad
A	I know I know I know
B	cos don't get me wrong I do understand that he
A	he can be a grumpy old fucker but
B	but
A	but I mean like last week he was quite happy for me to go
B	yeah cos
A	he didn't want me
B	wanted to watch his
A	he wanted to watch his tennis
B	tennis
A	and they actually said to me cor he likes his tennis doesn't he?
B	he loves his sport in general but then
A	and I said yeah
B	he's ninety-two years old
A	that's right
B	for Christ's sake
A	I know I know
B	you know like
A	just leave him you know
B	yeah if he wants to watch his sport let him watch his sport
A	that's right yeah
B	but it just for
A	yeah well unless this is
A	I don't want
B	yeah I'm not entirely sure where we're going
A	no I'm not either
A	I know we haven't I know we haven't
A	anyway let me turn let me let's get to
A	oh
B	that's just taken us twenty odd minutes to erm get us to here that's that's
A	anything coming?
B	no you can go
A	what? that house?
B	the window
A	yeah
B	that's pretty isn't it?
A	yeah
B	there's a lot of houses in
A	mm
B	you
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	what was that? god
B	it was a
A	a hole
B	yeah no it was a
A	drain
B	drain yeah no offence mum but you're a terrible driver
A	I'm not a terrible driver
B	mm
A	still looking for houses and moaning and groaning that she's gonna lose all her money
A	I know I know I'm just
B	they've just shot themselves in the foot haven't they?
A	I'm completely and utterly gobsmacked I really am
B	I guess like you said they could rent they could live in nan's house and erm and come and stay with us
A	but I don't see why that that is even a
B	well why don't you put it on the table?
A	I'm going to
B	cos when's nan's kitchen being done? okay end of August?
A	well yeah end of August September but I mean
B	yeah
A	it doesn't matter is it they could be
B	yeah
A	the kitchen isn't gonna be a problem
B	yeah if nan comes and lives with you for or lives with yeah
A	which she's gonna live with us when the kitchen's done anyway so
B	yeah she might as well stay for an extra month or so
A	she might as well stay there for
B	mightn't she?
A	yeah exactly
B	but yeah but then
A	that's a minimum of forty thousand pounds over her budget
B	why would you do that to yourself?
A	I do not know
B	why would you
A	I
B	put yourself in more debt?
A	I don't know
B	that's a massive amount of debt
A	but they're saying that they're gonna get erm a er
B	an endowment are they?
A	an endowment
B	yeah
A	but I don't think they know how much they're gonna get on their endowment we were supposed to be getting fifty thousand
B	what is an what is an endowment?
A	well you pay a life insurance for over twenty-five years or whatever and according to how the stock exchange goes you get an endowment at the end of it well we were calculated to get a twenty-six thousand pound endowment at the end of ours we ended up having to pay more towards it cos our endowment never materialised
B	so how much did you get?
A	nothing
B	you got nothing from your endowment?
A	nothing from our endowment so if
B	yeah
A	because if not
B	cos like no offence but er how much they they sold theirs for two hundred and sixty thousand?
A	yeah
B	like I do understand that house house prices are increasing and they are going up to like between three hundred and four hundred thousand pounds but if they can't afford it don't look in that price bracket
A	they couldn't afford it but they need a mortgage
B	yeah
A	and they don't wanna take out a mortgage but my view is if you don't take
B	do they not have a mortage then?
A	well they
B	have they paid off their house?
A	their mortgage finishes next year
B	oh I see okay
A	yeah they haven't got very much left on their mortgage but the fact is that you know they've just got to be sensible about it and you've got to actually sit there
B	yeah of course
A	yeah
B	she's made this massive decision based on the fact that she wanted something to look forward to
A	yeah
B	but now she's become more stressed than
A	yeah
B	it's worth
A	yeah
B	like
A	well no they've got whatever mortgage they've got now they'd have to add another what bit onto it
B	well they can't if they've only got one year left on their mortgage they can't have much to pay off
A	thank you
B	yeah they can't have much left to pay off but
A	mm
B	just seems so stupid borrowing forty thousand pounds for now when it's in savings when it's in really good savings
A	I know
B	and then they're gonna lose money because they're nan will have to pay a fine to take it out
A	oh well
B	why do we live with why are relatives such like bloody morons?
A	I know we have
B	have we?
A	yeah
B	do you name your satnav?
A	no
B	mine's Penny
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	it isn't
B	looks a bit
A	do you want any strawberries?
B	er yeah I think I might buy some fruit
A	cool I wanted to bottle some raspberries this afternoon
B	do you?
A	mm
B	so are you gonna go and buy loads?
A	yep
