B	oh she's very near there isn't she?
A	yeah erm she is cos she could sort of show me where she lived she's like up on the cliff
B	yeah
A	erm but it was lovely it was really nice to see her and we so we met in the car park
B	yeah
A	and it was really really windy it had been really really windy the night before and it was still quite windy
B	cos it's right near the coast as well
A	so yeah exactly so we walked down to the beach with the kids and
B	oh her boys are really sweet aren't they?
A	they're so nice
B	I know they're really kind of cheeky as well and they're very
A	oh they're just lovely
B	yeah and they've got this gorgeous hair haven't they? with kind of
B	yeah
A	and then she had to go and do I can't remember what she had to do some work or the kids were going to an art class and she had to go and do some work or something like that
B	yeah
A	and erm so she went off and me and
B	yeah
A	I think about three hours or something like that
B	she's good company isn't she? when you
A	she's just really easy company and
B	yeah
A	it was just nice to catch up and we just talked about the kids and
B	yeah
A	you know sort of work and schools and you know that sort of thing
B	yeah because she's she's thinking of er changing from cos she I mean she's had to stop her work because of her back
A	yeah but she's doing bits and pieces
B	and erm is she?
A	yeah
B	cos she was thinking of going into teaching
A	yeah was she? she didn't mention that actually
B	oh okay alright
A	yeah but she
B	yeah
A	erm
B	she's
A	but I think she has er the I mean obviously nobody ever truly knows from the outside
B	yeah
A	but she seems to have quite a good balance with what's his name? is it
A	yeah
A	no she's
B	yeah
A	he works really hard he does work at home sometimes but that's fine we just sort of work around each other
B	yeah
A	and erm you know she said when his kids are down that's that seems to be a successful kind of stepmum thing from what she says
B	yeah
A	it does sound quite
B	yeah
A	good but
B	one of the girls wanted to move in
A	really?
B	for a while cos she was erm having problems with her mum
A	yeah yeah
B	but I think well er I think she she was kind of kicking back as her mum's a bit more structured than
A	yeah yeah
B	I think she was kind of maybe looking for an easier life
A	yeah exactly but erm I yeah I just got the sense that she was really quite happy actually not in that kind of I'm fucking happy kind of way
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know but in a yeah life's good and I like life and it's not without its hitches and you know she did say it is bloody knackering
B	yeah
A	and especially when the stepchildren are there
B	yeah
A	but she said it is hard work because I've got two young active boys and you know the older kids do go oh can't you keep them quiet? and she's a bit like well no cos they're two young boys and this is their home
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	and that's how it is you know and but I did sort of get that sense that she's she's alright actually
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	I think you're right er
A	yeah
B	I just flew over a few years ago I think it was three years ago
A	yeah yeah
B	and just thought I've not seen her for so long so I actually got a flight just went to see her and just went back just
A	yeah yeah
B	did that and nothing else and they were so sweet
A	oh
B	I was so touched I didn't even know that they knew it was like a roast
B	and that's when erm things were going erm like funny with
A	yeah yeah
B	so I asked their advice which was like really funny
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	they were very
A	yeah
B	we were all we'd had a few glasses of wine and
A	mm
B	we don't worry too much about things and
A	mm mm
A	I know
B	has never
A	I know that's fucking weird
A	she didn't talk about that but I do know that
B	she doesn't like her
A	but she's never met her how can she?
A	mm
B	it's better that she hasn't met she doesn't want to meet her she doesn't really
A	mm
B	like any demands that she puts on
A	yeah
B	sometimes
A	mm mm
B	you know she says she can hear him saying oh you know don't worry about things and
A	mm mm
B	you know any tenderness going there or that kind of thing
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	but but they've kind of got some kind of
A	mm
B	they they've got something that works haven't they?
A	yeah absolutely yeah
B	and he spends a few days every week up in
A	mm
B	and sometimes she says you know it's not easy and sometimes she wonders whether
A	mm
B	he's being completely faithful
A	mm mm
B	I know she's said that to me
A	mm
B	she doesn't know but she's she hardly sort of
A	mm
B	it was only when I I kind of brought it up with her but she'll
A	mm
B	and really she just said look
A	mm
B	may've been but you know
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	I don't know possibly but he provides for me and erm he's
A	mm mm
B	you know I know that he's er I'm the one that he wants
A	mm
B	I don't know but erm
A	mm yeah
B	maybe he hasn't I don't know
A	yeah
B	but she doesn't want to she wouldn't want to go there she wouldn't want to know she wouldn't want to
A	yeah mm
B	but they but they do quite a lot of fun things together as well don't they? they said they
A	mm yes they have lots of holidays and they go skiing
B	yeah
A	and it sounds great
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they went to erm
A	excellent mm
B	I think that's the kind of thing that keeps them ticking over
A	yeah
B	it's nice to see something
A	yeah
B	that maybe they're not always the the erm er the easiest couple either and then you can see that that works
A	mm mm
B	that's that's quite heartening isn't it?
A	mm mm mm
B	you know they have their trials and he works very long hours
A	yeah which is completely normal that's what I'd want to see in a relationship you know my my friends
B	yeah
A	you know
B	really?
A	you know yeah yeah yeah and erm you know it's definitely have er had its rough patches but they're both really up front about when it has been tough
B	yeah
A	they've got loads of friends they've got it's open house round at theirs
B	yeah yeah
A	you know they're real party people but they're very boundaried as well
B	yeah
A	and the good thing about those two is they're really up front about tough times you know if you go out for a drink with
B	mm
A	she will sit there and go bloody
B	yeah yeah
A	you know that is a real relationship
B	yeah
A	you know it does have its up and downs they have really worked through stuff
B	yeah
A	and they've you know come out the other side
B	yeah
A	and that's what it's all about isn't it? really
B	yeah cos I mean I I I don't know if I've ever really made a successful partnership I think maybe this is the closest and even
A	yeah yeah
B	how do you feel about that kind of partnership? would you ever want one again? or?
A	if I did it would be very unconventional that's why it was very refreshing to hear
B	yeah
A	you know she said I do what I wanna do you know I do my thing
B	yeah
A	I don't answer to anyone and
B	yeah
A	you know he does his thing I do my thing and that's exactly the kind of thing I would want to do
B	yeah
A	I couldn't imagine having I I couldn't I know that I couldn't have a conventional relationship
B	yeah
A	where I was in somebody's pocket all the time where
B	yeah
A	you did everything socially with them where
B	yeah
A	to come and see you do you know what I mean? it's just like fuck off are you still here?
B	yeah I know what you mean
A	fuck off go and do something you know I couldn't I couldn't do that
B	yeah
A	and I know a lot of people do do it and it would drive me insane
B	yeah
A	it would drive me mad I would just say to someone just go and get a life just fuck off
A	and really get a life and I'll see you next week maybe if I've got time
A	you know so if er you know that's it's no coincidence that the longest relationship I've ever had was with
B	yes
B	yes
A	working in clubs running the
B	yeah
A	and it worked well because I'd
B	yeah
A	just doing loads of pills
B	yeah
A	with all the gay guys
B	yeah
A	really out partying
B	yeah
A	you know oh I'm gonna go to
B	yeah
A	you know that's that's what works for me
B	also can you imagine looking back on your life and having something like
A	mm mm
B	kind of like oh god what was?
A	suicidal
B	yeah what was my life?
A	yeah
B	only about sort of one person?
A	and I think there's so much rhetoric to make you believe that that's the right thing to do there's so much media there's so much bullshit out there to make you believe that that's what you should aim for
B	yeah
A	to only be with one person
B	yeah
A	you know talking to
B	oh yeah? what does he kind of say?
A	well he's nearly fifty
B	yeah
A	and he firmly believes he's definitely been er by his own admission in his own words you know in his twenties he was a bit of a ladies' man you know he had a child in his teens
B	was he? did he?
B	god
A	you know so he's definitely you know he's been around the block
B	yeah
A	and he
B	yeah
A	you that you should be not should be but it's more normal for most humans and he fully understands that some people like to be with one person for their whole life and that's fantastic but he thinks that you go through so many phases in your life that it's very very difficult for one person to weather those phases with you
B	yeah
A	and he feels that he's a vastly different person in his for example twenties to what he was in his thirties to his forties
B	mm yeah
A	because he feels that he's really grown and developed and changed and not necessarily become a better or a worse person but is a completely different person and he feels that he really needs different things
B	yeah
A	not necessarily women
B	yeah
A	but he's talking about women as well he er like he him seeing me he that that's a sort of particular phase in his life or whatever and he
B	yeah
A	at some point wants to retire probably to the south coast and so therefore you know sort of
B	mm
A	seeing me and the south coast and that kind of thing but not it's not just about women but he he does think and also he's sort of saying you know
B	yeah
A	you sort of got married when you were twenty
B	yeah
A	and then you're gonna be dead by the time you're fifty but he's sort of saying look
B	mm
A	I'm probably gonna live hopefully until I'm like eighty or something like that
B	yeah
A	there is no way
B	yeah yeah
A	you know he wants to do different things he's never really travelled because he's spent so much time working and building up a property portfolio and doing all his craft stuff that he does all his furniture upholstering and
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
A	he's really interesting he's a really amazing guy actually you know he's done
B	he does sound quite he's very nice to you isn't he?
A	he's yeah he is he's but he's very unassuming
B	texting all the time isn't he?
A	yeah constantly
B	yeah
A	but not in a kind of
B	yeah yeah
A	all the time erm he's er he's a very interesting person and he's got lots of ideas he hasn't really travelled and he really wants to travel
B	yeah
A	and that's another thing he likes being around me because I've done a lot of travelling and that really fits with with where his head is at at the moment and you know
B	yeah
A	I have a perspective on life that fits with his perspective on life at the moment in his current phase of his life
B	yeah
A	and he and it is so interesting because he said oh you know some people might look at me from the outside and say oh you're just having a mid-life crisis and it's like and he said well if that's what a mid-life crisis is then bring it on cos I'm really enjoying it
B	yeah yeah
A	and erm and I I just really like that because he talks through how he feels and you know he has actually thought about what he's doing he hasn't just sort of gone oh yeah my wife is a bitch and so I
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? he really talks about it and he will say that you know he still has an excellent relationship with his wife ex-wife
B	yeah
A	and you know er she was a hugely important person in his life and still is
B	yeah
A	I mean his his best friend is her brother
B	yeah
A	you know because they've know each other for such a long time
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	god
A	they're a very very tight-knit
B	mm
A	about their ex about the mother of their children I couldn't be with someone that was
B	yeah
A	you know talked about a woman on that level
B	yeah I know what you mean
A	do you know what I mean? he's had three children with them
B	I know
A	no I need I need to be around someone that shows respect to their ex
B	yeah
A	and talks about them and
B	yeah
A	and that's fine you know that's okay for him to mention that because I certainly have mentioned numerous times about my frustrations with
B	yeah
A	but I talk respectfully about
B	yeah
A	you know but I couldn't I couldn't imagine erm
B	yeah
A	but we don't talk about
B	it does sound like you've got something very you know he cares about you doesn't he?
A	yeah yeah and I care about him but
B	yeah
A	at the same time I don't have to have him here like I I did feel
B	oh is he?
A	and yeah and he was going for
A	and he's been doing this particular role for about fifteen years and has just kind of been coasting in it
B	yeah
A	and he did talk to me quite a lot about it and because it's got quite big implications
B	yeah
A	it's like managing a night team and things like that erm and I did a couple of mock interviews with him I looked over some things and did some mock interviews and stuff and he got the job and he does he does sort of say
B	mm
A	oh you know a lot of that was down to you and I sort of go oh not really
B	yeah
A	but he he firmly believes
B	oh really?
A	you know cos he'd just been in the one job
B	yeah
A	so he really needed and I really helped him because I'd recently had an interview and
B	yeah
A	you know and I really changed cos he wasn't he was really self-deprecating and it was just like you you can't you can't
B	yeah you can't can you? in that kind of situation
A	you know so it's not like you know he just sat down and talked and I went yeah that was great it was a really big sort of process
B	yeah
A	erm but
A	I completely forgot it was
B	and usually you're actually you're usually very good at remembering
A	I did feel bad but
A	because I can't put a man here
B	yeah
A	because I've got so many other things so I was at work
B	yeah
A	and he was going oh is it nice and sunny in
A	and he said oh it's quite it's it's nice in
B	oh god he should've just said
A	and I just went oh right okay cool you know I was at work
B	but you're only human
A	and I well I did think
A	and then he texted me again in the evening
B	yeah
A	saying something else and said oh I'm exhausted after a heavy day or
B	yeah
A	I just texted back saying I'm so sorry
A	I felt awful really awful I was thinking a good girlfriend would've sent a text in the morning
A	or the night before the thing is it had gone into my head the night before and I did nothing about it
A	yeah
B	and that is
A	yeah
B	it's not like
A	yeah mm
B	and it's their er their first girlfriend and boyfriend and
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's not like that is it?
A	yeah
B	you have separate busy lives
A	yeah
B	which are which fill your head enough
A	yeah completely yeah and he gets it he gets like
B	yeah
A	and everyone and he had the kind of job where he could just not turn up in the office for god knows how long as long as he
B	yeah
A	that I couldn't meet him for lunch
B	yeah
A	he didn't get it but I couldn't
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah exactly
B	and didn't have a life
A	I know
A	and it was just a bit like and he was like oh I'll have to break you of er this habit of being so diligent and it's like it's not being diligent it's called working
A	do you know what I mean? it's like he's got no concept of you know and I'd be like oh I'm really tired he's like oh come on let's go out
B	yeah
A	oh
A	do you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	but with
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know and we're trying to make a plan at the moment but he's always got a bloody family thing or a funeral or
B	yeah
A	but I like that
B	yeah
A	you know even though it is a little bit like
B	yeah
A	I really really like it because it it is normal life that is normal life to prioritise your children
B	yeah
A	prioritise your family have to get stuff done around the house
B	yeah
A	have to like go on holiday with your kids or whatever good
B	yeah
A	I'm glad you're doing that stuff
B	yeah
A	that's what you're supposed to do you know?
B	but do you think in the future? well I suppose you won't you don't know but that'll probably become a bit less for him and maybe a bit less for you and you might
A	might be but he's a grandad now
A	yeah so yeah so we'll see
B	god how how old's his grandchild?
A	er he was born in January
B	oh right so it's very new
A	mm
B	does that make you feel weird at all or anything?
A	no not at all no I made lots of jokes about shagging a grandad
A	you know and er things like
B	and living with a grandad
A	very occasionally if I'm texting him on a Sunday morning he'll get back to me Sunday afternoon and go I'm sorry I was having a nap or something like that
B	yeah
A	erm yeah like
B	yeah
A	that's what he does you know?
B	yeah
A	yeah it might become less it might not but I think because our entire relationship has been based on us being very very
B	really?
A	yeah yeah and it that's where
B	do you miss him then? oh yeah how's things with
A	sometimes I mean I don't see very much of
B	oh yeah
A	sometimes because they both are busy people
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	yeah yeah
A	that's the you know we have a conversation every single day it's highly highly unusual for us to go a day
B	really?
A	without a
A	no no no always WhatsApp always WhatsApp
A	there's er always a conversation going on
B	yeah
A	always yeah cos I haven't got time if I'm with
B	yeah
A	I prioritise
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna be on the phone you know
B	yeah
A	but it means er it can wait you know
B	god you must be good on the old kind of do you do it all on your phone?
A	yeah
B	or on the computer? right
A	yeah yeah no it's just a long-running backwards and forwards all the time always
