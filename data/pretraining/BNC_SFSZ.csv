B	really?
A	well
A	yeah
A	erm
B	but
A	mm
B	before it happens
C	but it's the big problem
A	and interesting
C	yeah
B	yeah I know
A	but
B	yeah
A	and get
B	yeah
A	knowing other people and
B	what do we not have those anymore?
C	I think like
A	basically
C	actually have a better track record of stopping terrorist attacks than intelligence services do
A	yeah
B	mm
D	but you do need
A	to do some other stuff
C	probably yeah
C	but they really aren't that though just
D	no
A	well
B	great
D	er
D	er er
A	what do you mean er er?
D	er?
A	great
D	er
A	erm
D	me
B	I've got some homework for maths I'll do that tonight
C	mm?
A	you've not done your
D	no
A	mm
D	yes
A	even though it's got like
D	they're not chemically bonded
A	aren't they?
B	oh
A	sorry?
C	he said piss off
A	why?
B	to
A	why?
B	saying
D	no that
B	like six times a day
A	well that's cos it's his homework
C	that's because it's his homework
A	did you not realise that's why we're having these conversations?
C	yeah
B	was it really brilliant?
A	yes it was
C	yeah
B	what was it about?
C	Perfume
B	were you analysing it or actually writing a
D	he was writing a sequel
C	we don't really do writing a something else
B	what were you writing mm?
C	like stuff about
B	mm
B	or did you choose?
C	no
B	no
A	what was the question?
C	a tick
A	so is he actually a tick?
C	no
B	what's a tick?
A	right
C	it's a metaphor
A	a tick is like a
B	oh right
C	like a
B	yeah
A	not like a cross
D	ticks are really bad for you
A	tick fever
D	mm
A	it's a
C	mm not too much
C	yeah I've done quite a lot of them
A	have you?
unknown_female	mm
B	enough to nourish me for twelve hours
A	which what?
A	which was
B	three slices of carrot
B	not very much potato and a small cut of the meat
A	woo
B	mm
D	what do you say?
A	so you say probably have a banana in a minute
B	no
A	did you go to a coffee shop?
B	no
A	did you go anywhere indoors?
A	yeah that would be pretty horrible
C	mm
A	because they're cooked
C	because carrots
A	oh okay
D	mm
C	mm
A	we went to into town so that
A	but when we got there it turned out he hasn't actually received any of the PIN numbers yet so
C	I found
A	oh yeah
D	oh that's so cool
A	erm er
C	mm
A	have you told
C	and also one called Ook
B	huh what?
C	which is a language for orangutans
B	wonderful
A	er but what were these called? er you said there's a Wikipedia article about?
C	there was a wiki on
A	esoteric programming languages I like that
C	also Whitespace which is pretty cool
A	what's that?
C	it's
B	I understand
D	that's really cool
A	okay
A	you both have to say I think that's really cool
D	yeah
B	well I don't think it's really cool but I just understand it
A	okay
B	I think it's kind of obvious
C	mm
A	er can you explain to
C	er there's one where
B	mm mm mm what is this?
A	sorry?
B	woah
D	so do you think you could make one which would be?
A	that
B	define cool
D	which
C	well that is
D	so if you
C	mm
D	okay
C	that would be a fork bomb
A	it would be a fork bomb?
C	yes
A	oh and then again and again again
C	and then it
A	okay
A	I was
C	mm
A	language thing
D	last year I was on Hour of Code which was really hilariously bad and I spent several hours on it
D	but the interesting thing was that
B	yeah we spent like five weeks on an hour of code didn't we?
D	like
D	each lesson's an hour long
A	yeah
D	erm
C	yeah
A	were you supposed to have an hour of code a week maybe?
D	yeah but no I
A	why?
B	why?
D	and then it crashed the server
B	well that's not very surprising
A	why did you do that?
C	well you should've implemented safety for that
D	yeah and after that erm the server was so slow
B	when
A	yeah
B	you were doing Python last year
D	but everyone's computer was
B	I mean
C	and that is like the most basic program ever
A	you you use new technology to still be rude to one another
C	that's
A	is
C	is twenty
A	oh
C	ten print hello twenty go to ten
A	oh okay right so it goes on and on and on
C	yeah
A	go to you see?
C	mm
A	see go to that's how
C	or if it was
C	if
A	right
C	and that would
A	repeatedly
C	er
A	erm how many
D	mm
C	many
D	that's very
A	is that more than sixty million
C	to be fair that's probably in COBOL which takes ages to write anything
B	it was handwritten
C	when they say by hand it doesn't mean written out by hand
D	no
C	it means
A	you didn't just go and get it from that place that people get bits of code from what's it called that place?
B	Stack Overflow?
A	yeah Stack Overflow
B	cool
C	how's it going with the job interview?
A	well I haven't had it since yesterday
A	yeah
C	usually yeah
A	I suppose that's what a line of code is
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	so
B	or until you finish the function and then you have to press enter
A	yes so sometimes they're short sometimes they're short and sometimes they're long
A	yeah
B	oh right yeah I see
C	yeah you could but
A	cos even like a sentence is that you get the end of a thing
C	you could in theory write any program
A	that you
C	yeah
A	and to
C	and there are
C	endless debates about the
A	are there endless debates?
C	except in Python where it's not possible to do it except in one way
C	mm
A	really really brilliant
B	I agree
A	it is great
B	I dunno
A	nothing was that?
B	I dunno
A	I dunno?
D	I'm interested in butterfly
A	put the bloody thing down
D	I'm going to
A	you're going to throw what at him?
D	throw this piece of metal at you
A	can we not throw things at each other
A	do we
unknown_female	mm
A	get to watch more Doctor Who then tonight as it's Saturday?
D	yeah
C	hooray
B	I'm doing homework
A	I know you are cos you don't like Doctor Who
