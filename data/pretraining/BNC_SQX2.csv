E	just cos you fall out with your neighbour it don't mean to say the the new
D	exactly
E	new owners will
D	yeah exactly
E	they might get on like a house on fire

I looked for you in Halifax he went oh no I was in Barclays I said well why didn't you just say you were in Barclays when I asked you? and he said oh it's just easier to say yes if someone asks

B	she is an animal
D	why don't they cut her eyebrows off? why do they give her great big long eyebrows?
B	cos we make her we make her do it like that
E	yeah that's
B	that's the Schnauzer look
E	the Schnauzer cut yeah
D	yeah but why do you have to follow the
C	well why can't you be different?
D	cos we don't
E	don't have to but
D	ah you've got a little bent tail
B	don't you point out her bent tail
D	why?
B	she's bent
B	sometimes it's crooked and
E	how old is he?
D	has got a little kink in it
B	yeah it's bent it's bent
D	that's enough come here come here come here no I don't want your paw I want you to come
A	well at least if she ever got lost you could say it's the dog with the bent tail she's got a defining feature
B	mm she has
E	if you if you look all dogs have a bend in their tail
B	mm
C	is that on her passport?
E	yes
C	is it?
E	yes
C	mm
B	mm
D	is it on yours?
C	I haven't got a bent tail
A	don't be rude
E	mind you saying that
B	mm what was that name again that you were laughing at?
C	Esme Hoad
B	no another Coronation Street character
E	oh
C	oh right
B	what was her name?
C	erm
A	Helga
B	no
A	Annie Walker
B	no
A	Bet Lynch
D	there was an Esme something in Corrie well years ago wasn't there?
C	not that I know of
D	before our day before we were allowed to watch
E	it starts with an I oh
A	before you were allowed to watch it?
D	oh I
C	Ida Clough she's brilliant Ida Clough
B	is she still in it Ida Clough?
D	no
C	no she died
D	hasn't been in it for years
B	oh
D	did the character die?
A	Deirdre's died
D	ah and oh
B	mm
D	well now they're gonna kill Deirdre off
A	they'll probably just say oh Deirdre's dead
B	how are they going to do away with her then?
D	well I don't know
A	she's already left she left a few months ago
D	yeah what was what why did she leave where did she go?
A	she popped off somewhere to Spain?
D	no the programme
A	no I don't know if she popped she went somewhere
D	oh
A	cos she was meant to be coming back but obviously now she's dead so they'll have to kill her while she's away
E	well maybe she went off because she was having treatment or something
D	yeah I think so
A	she went off cos she was ill
B	would
A	but like she was planning to go back
E	do you know what she died of?
D	no
E	they they never tell you do they?
D	just everything's just
B	they're very mysterious about it aren't they? I wonder if it was suicide
E	it
D	no listen I think her breast cancer returned
A	do you think?
C	yeah
C	breast no I didn't but I think that was right yeah
D	cos generally speaking once you've got secondaries from breast cancer
E	stay down good girl good girl
D	that's your lot you don't if unless they can get it in the primary stage if you get secondaries from breast cancer you don't that's it that's what well not generally that's the rule
E	yeah
B	awful isn't it? mm
D	so unless her breast cancer came back as another primary if it came back as a secondary from her first one that would have been her chips
A	yeah
D	would be up mate
A	she wasn't very old was she really?
D	sixty
B	how old was Ida Clough sixty-six?
D	yeah
A	well not very old to die really is it?
D	no
B	not in this day and age
E	at least twenty-eight
D	well it depends on my depends I'd like to think I could live to be eightyish
B	well I wanna make it if I don't make eighty
E	but healthily
D	but then when I say that it only gives me another thirty years that's a bit scary isn't it?
E	but healthily
D	mm?
A	well if I was like
E	depends like what
D	well yeah that's what I was gonna say it depends on a lot of things I'd like
A	if I'm like
D	well yeah I if I'm like
A	but it depends if all your friends have died of things
D	I
A	I know my mum's desperate to be a grandmother she keeps telling us to have babies
B	are you?
D	oh
A	keeps going
D	well yeah
A	oh I'd love to be a granny
D	I'd love to be a grandmother now
A	I'm ready for that stage now
D	I'm ready for in my life for that now and feel that

D	yeah doesn't bother me in the slightest now
A	dad?
C	what?

D	you are self appointed you've turned down all offers of help
C	oh I didn't hear it sorry
D	after what oops

B	so you can speak ill of the dead if you want to?
A	yeah
D	well why not?
A	I guess it
D	you're speaking ill of your
A	I guess it depends who you're speaking ill of a relative
D	well yeah
A	if it's her mother I'm sure he wouldn't
D	you wouldn't say it to her mum would you?
A	say that but
B	do you remember when you said to a friend of yours whose mother had just died of cancer
D	no
B	and you were very uncomfortable about it
D	I don't remember that I remember saying
B	it certainly it was years ago twenty years ago
B	recently of cancer and you made some kind of
E	no
D	now you're beginning
B	daft light hearted comment
D	things are beginning to stir in my mind
B	yeah and something about
A	or is he planting a memory in your head?
D	I don't know
B	I know
A	something that wasn't there
D	something is stirring
A	yeah
D	in my mind I do do do you remember who it was? cos I
B	no I can't but it was one of your maybe it was a
D	god I don't
B	it was a very long time ago
A	a
A	oh
B	that's a town near
A	yeah I know cos mum always talks about it
B	apparently
A	I thought you said a
B	mm
D	I did live in
A	yeah
D	I've never lived in
A	sorry I wasn't being a German
B	a German? what does that mean?
A	they're so precise
A	do you know I was I was folding the washing and
A	to put them in a
B	oh no dump him
A	to put them in a ball
B	he told he used to tell me how to roll up socks and
A	or how
B	how to
A	it's the most
B	fold a tea towel
A	cos I just get socks together and I
A	I will I will
B	you can't change him though
B	ah
C	yeah
D	no I won't now
A	oh what cos dad said it?
D	oh I can't
B	is that a standard?
E	I should say so yes
B	grateful
E	what are you looking for?
B	I'm trying to find this and I a
E	there are so many American ones
B	well there's a huge
D	why are you looking up about the Schnauzers on the internet?
B	cos you were asking about the eyebrows
A	now he's in a he's got a you know you follow a lead
B	and now I'm looking for
A	yeah
D	so what does it say about the eyebrows?
B	well nothing particular you see why do you have them cut?
A	is that one with its eyebrows cut? you kind of can't really see that looks very pixelly
E	oh yeah it looks nice
A	it looks kind of
E	we've been talking about you
A	are
B	black
E	black and white er no you can't
B	there were some white ones
E	we did the miniature ones in white
B	they're like
A	okay
E	so they're
B	the black ones they're beautiful
A	we were looking up really weird dog breeds yesterday
E	you can get black and silver
D	oh just well yeah
B	that's silver
A	you can some
D	we were looking up really weird dog mixtures
A	so like Chihuahuas and and like
B	Great Danes
D	yeah
A	cos Chow Chows are obviously very fluffy and Huskies are quite fluffy and then there was a little puppy and you could hardly see the puppy
D	Basset
A	for the fluff
B	yeah probably was born and it couldn't find its way out
A	yeah
B	from the
A	and there were like little erm what was it? like er a German Shepherd and a and a Dachshund and it was like a really it was like a really it was like a German Shepherd but with tiny tiny legs
D	yes it was
A	it was like a mini German Shepherd it was funny
B	ah poor little thing so what do they do? they
D	I guess it was
B	the dog Dachshund on a stool and
D	well no unless it's
A	well I guess it's
D	unless it's just accidental breeding
A	yeah I guess if you've got two
B	no how but how does it physically happen? because you know a male Chihuahua
D	well unless they
B	could not mate with a female
D	well maybe it was the female Chihuahua
B	Alsatian
D	with the male bigger dog then
E	yeah
B	no unless you know what I'm meaning unless a a grown up an adult helped them
B	a grown up
A	a grown up
D	but then again if it was a Chihuahua
B	if you're going to mate with that
D	with an Alsatian father then
D	then I wouldn't think the Chihuahua would have much it wouldn't be probably wouldn't be able to give birth very easily
B	no no and it would be dangerous for the mother if the
D	yeah
B	if the if if it was the other way round
A	it's er erm
B	yeah
A	apparently it's theoretically possible but obviously if you put a wolf and a Chihuahua together you wouldn't it wouldn't mate it would eat the Chihuahua
B	yeah
E	yes please
C	or there's red there
B	mm
B	my my
E	my sister's got a cross between a Chihuahua and a Jack Russell
D	and is it cute?

B	yes thank you
E	er and blank out the head
D	yeah
E	it's a small Jack Russell
E	and it's got this biggish body with a tiny head
D	a tiny head

D	and when she put when she first got it
C	he's got plenty of
D	she put a face she put a picture on Facebook of it and I went wow
E	mind you my sister does erm er
D	yeah
E	spoils it unbelievably
B	yeah
D	yeah I I hate that when people do that with their dogs
A	oh
B	but we're probably we're probably a bit like that with her
D	well
A	yeah
E	it's alright
B	we try not to
E	well
B	I know you're laughing at me
E	but the thing is
