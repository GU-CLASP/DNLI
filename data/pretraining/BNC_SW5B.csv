C	fourteen days though because he was looking slimmer at the Brits than he was from the Grammys in November so he has lost a bit since then
B	mm
C	but apparently yeah two stone in two weeks
A	yeah
B	but I don't think that's a healthy loss
C	no exactly you can't maintain that
B	no
A	that's the thing you see
B	mm
A	as I said the slower you lose it
B	yeah
A	if you lose it and then you're more likely to keep it off
C	yeah
A	than this sudden weight
C	but even now
B	yeah
A	gains
C	I know we
A	or weight loss
C	like we had a
A	and you gain it just a quick
C	bad weekend but like to only put on two pound
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	that's a good thing
B	mm
C	but really it's you
A	mm
C	and I I shouldn't worry because while I've had bad weeks and I've gone in and like over Christmas I ate terribly
B	mm
C	over Christmas it's
B	yeah
C	mm
B	no I I I think it's erm
A	mm
B	cos whatever you do to lose two stone in a fortnight is pretty radical
A	it's drastic yeah
B	I don't know what he's done but that's something pretty radical
A	and you can't maintain that
B	and you can't maintain that kind of
C	no cos
A	can you?
B	diet
C	as soon as you then go back to trying to eat semi normally
B	yeah yeah
C	your body's gonna be in shock and won't be
A	mm
B	yeah exactly
A	no
B	it's you've just got to eat
C	that's the thing you like
A	you've got to be sensible haven't you? I mean
C	but then saying
B	mm
C	this lady I read some of the key points of her erm approach are you can't call
B	mm
C	erm but she's whereas they say you can have unlimited pasta she's obviously saying like you shouldn't eat massive meals you should eat sort of smaller portions
B	mm
C	and not snack if you're gonna have something have er something that's semi substantial that's gonna tide you over a bit longer as opposed to like a biscuit or something
B	mm
C	but erm so it was all quite sensible stuff so that's why I'm thinking it probably was where he's been to all these parties and stuff
B	mm
C	and drinking alcohol he's probably retained all this water
B	mm
C	then he's thought I'm gonna start eating sort of sensible food and he he that's where he's lost it it's in water retention
B	mm
C	but then saying that the second week of Slimming World like how I can't remember how
B	you lost four pounds in the second week didn't you?
C	yeah so that was so that was basically probably the similar thing it was just sort of water and
B	yeah
C	other stuff but
A	mm
B	mm
C	yeah so
B	but even so that's still
A	I need to do that would be good wouldn't it?
A	a month two stone yeah er oh and then I'd be there
B	but then you'd have to stay there that's the thing
A	yeah
C	do it gradually
A	I know
C	well you've got a competition with your sister now
B	yeah
C	yeah that's right
B	that's what you need you need you need a
A	yeah
B	a sort of aim you when you first start it's all keen and you're fired up but you do gradually lose that so you
C	yeah
B	a competition with
A	it goes
B	yeah
B	I'm not
C	yeah just before
B	mm
C	a bit before Christmas
B	so who's doing my nights next week
A	I don't know yet
B	oh has it not?
A	not so far as I know unless she's gone and sorting it out today but
C	oh dear
B	but
A	is she?
B	yeah
A	mm yeah
C	yeah and mum also I've got to pay out fifty-two quid to have another DBS check
A	have you?
B	oh
C	yeah because I'm already working as the thing
B	mm
C	that will allow me to go into all the different schools I've got to go in to
B	oh right
C	do my training but I've already got one
B	yeah
C	I already work in a school with kids
C	why have I got to spend out
A	yeah
C	doctor to do
B	mm
C	so I've got to spend out and er paying for my application nineteen quid so in all it's costing me about a hundred it's gonna cost me about a hundred just over a hundred quid just to apply to be a bloody teacher
A	mm
C	crazy
A	mm
B	yeah this DBS though I mean what do they do on that check to so you can go to all the different schools?
C	yeah I know
B	that they do all they've got to do is find out if you've got a criminal record well they know you haven't got a criminal record because you've got a DBS check
C	yeah I don't know
B	I suppose for you know those renewals at least the renewals are paid for but didn't they?
A	oh well I
C	I'd understand if I was working say
A	its showing it's charged but it's not working
C	with vulnerable like if my DBS was from like working with
B	yeah
C	vulnerable adults
B	yeah
C	and then going to children but mine was done to work in the school
B	did you have one for when you came to
C	no they just took my one from the school
B	oh did they?
C	yeah they photocopied that
B	because you never they they they always pay for CLs what's the difference between DBS and CRB?
C	yeah that's the thing I've got a CRB at the school which I then carried over but it's
B	what's a DBS then?
C	I have no
B	oh
C	maybe a bit more broader
B	cos they they all
C	that's probably why
B	the
A	yeah
C	oh
B	start working there don't they?
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	whether it's working with kids or

E	alright
E	hey don't do that you scag erm
B	so are you actually going to
E	well yeah I'm gonna ask her that tomorrow
B	mm
E	I haven't emailed back yet but I don't want them to like give up on me
B	no no I I can understand though because you know it could be
E	I might say erm yeah I'm really keen I really enjoyed Monday erm I'm really interested in the work could you erm or do you have to I have er I'll say I have been offered a job
B	mm
E	erm
B	yes
E	so I'm subtly saying
B	yeah
E	you know
B	mm
E	without being too like how many hours is it?
B	yeah
E	and erm like I say or would it be worth accepting this job and we're gonna be able to work around it or would I need to dedicate more time
B	mm
E	to the project work?
B	but you don't want this job you said you said tonight
E	yeah but I'm just gonna say that like
B	yeah I know but well I'm I'm disregarding
E	I'd rather have the
B	yeah
E	if like this is my only option I would take it but seeing as like
B	mm
E	I'd rather even if it's at first not as much money or not as much security or not as many hours I'd rather
B	yeah
E	just cultivate that rather than
B	yeah
E	taking a job
B	no I can understand that
E	I'm not that keen on
B	I can understand that but you know
E	just because it's there
B	but if it was like six hours a month
E	yeah I know but
B	so you need
E	I'll have I'll
B	I think you need to
E	that's why I'm gonna ask
B	yeah
E	but we don't even know if I'll be offered this job he hasn't got back to me so I probably haven't got it
B	did he say he'd get back to you whether you've got it or not?
E	well he said the next couple of days and
B	what either way they'd contact you?
E	he
B	no
E	erm he just said the next couple of days so I assume he means either way
B	mm
E	erm and so he hasn't contacted me so I'm guessing not May
B	did you mention erm
E	no we didn't go through half of the interview oh next question how's
B	I just wondered when he was doing the sort of
E	no he didn't talk about
B	ah was he heartbroken by
E	apparently so yeah
B	oh does she feel guilty?
E	erm
B	yeah
E	I think she just got fed up with it
B	eh?
E	I think she just got fed up
B	what
E	apparently he was just
B	oh
E	and then they kept having chats about you know you've really got to you know stop being so obsessed with football
B	mm well if she'd if she'd told him and warned him
E	well yeah apparently they had had lots of chats and she said she couldn't bear to go through it again and she knew that all would happen is that
B	mm
E	he'd say oh I'll change and they'd be so that's why she just did it the way she did
B	mm well can't blame her can't blame her I mean
E	so
B	in that case
E	no I can kind of hear a buzzing which I think could be construed as water
B	sounds as though that it's absolutely suddenly pouring down with rain which it's not
E	no I can see I hear what you mean is water but I don't think it sounds like water really
B	mm
E	that much
B	well all I can say is if they do offer you this job at
E	well it's not it's not like
E	well well it's not like something I'm would really dread doing
B	mm
E	it does sound good it's just that
B	it's not the field
E	seeing as
B	that you're interested in is it?
E	yes seeing as there's something that's kind of showing an interest in me which is exactly what I want
B	mm
E	I don't wanna kind of make them lose interest in me
B	no no
E	so even though at the moment it's a bit annoying cos it's just kind of as and when
B	mm
E	it's like
B	yeah
E	cos why would they invest so much time in me if they don't want me to work
B	yeah
E	a bit quite a bit for them? so
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	mm
E	I'll show him the email and stuff
B	mm
E	has she done a post graduate as well?
B	er?
E	has she done a post grad as well?
B	well I don't know I didn't know she's done that in what?
E	I dunno she's just ticked post graduate
B	oh no no she hasn't done a post grad she said I'm doing my teacher training would that be erm classed as a post grad? and so I suppose if I haven't done it yet but I'll tick it anyway
E	oh
B	oh oh have it out see if you lived in America
E	that would be straight that would have been out a few years ago
B	that would have been out
E	I did ask him I said erm have I got an abscess or something? just because it feels really kind of painful
B	mm
E	and it never seems to be coming up it just seems to be painful but not coming up I wonder if it's stuck or something and he said oh no it looks fine it's just there isn't a lot of room for it to come up but erm
B	mm
E	it it's coming up
B	mine was sore for years on and off
E	yeah
B	they they they sort of settle down and do nothing for a few weeks
E	mm
B	and then they suddenly start pushing again and it was oh several years before
E	well this has been going on since I was seventeen
B	mm
E	it doesn't seem to have
B	mm
E	come up very much
B	no they're really slow really really slow and it was a long time and they used to make my gum really really sore
E	mm
B	and it would be raised it was a long long time before it even broke through once it had broken through it wasn't it wasn't as bad
E	oh it's annoying isn't it?
B	yeah
E	apparently we don't even need them anymore
B	I know it's the stupid thing about wisdom teeth
E	they're like apparently they
B	mm
E	because they're they're like an overhang from when we had bigger jaws
B	yeah
E	but
B	oh is that why we all have? I I've never had apart from they were so sore for so long
E	mm that's why a lot of people have problems with them growing through
B	yeah
E	cos there just isn't enough room in the mouth for them to come through
B	well I must have a really big mouth then cos I've never had any trouble with my wisdom teeth but
E	no a lot of people don't but
B	yeah
E	and I was looking up kind of you know what things that can go wrong with a wisdom tooth
B	I don't' know if
E	I dunno you'll have to ask her I guess
B	cos
E	brat
B	ah
E	what?
B	she's not a brat
E	oh don't start being like dad
E	I know I just don't know where to hang it especially if my room's being decorated
B	well yeah
E	also I don't really spend much time in my room
B	no
E	so it would just kind of sit there and not be seen
B	true
E	very much
B	put your graduation picture up there
E	I see that was just strewn in
B	yeah because dad took it down to put that up
E	mm
B	but he he does want to put it up I want
E	when are you gonna take a picture of
B	oh I don't know I don't know whether I should do it myself and just have it printed
E	yeah just go round next time you go round say
B	yeah
E	and
B	I want her in her hairdressing tabard as well
E	yeah and then you can just take it to erm Snappy Snaps or
B	yeah
E	Tesco's
B	yeah I'll have to check the size of yours I can't remember what size it is now
E	otherwise
B	yes I'll do that
E	it'll never get done
B	mm?
E	otherwise it'll never get done
B	yeah
E	I need a wee wee
B	oh I haven't seen that for ages
E	no
B	yeah but it totalled about up to eleven thousand
E	yeah
B	and then they seemed to sort of fluke it all the way through just wing it
E	oh that's lucky yeah there was a man on Tipping Point the other day and he just didn't know any of the answers but he was just going oh I'll give it a guess
B	yeah
E	and he kept getting the guesses right and he almost got the jackpot it was right on the edge
B	oh
E	he almost got that out er erm but then he used up all his things
B	mm
E	and he said do you want to do the final one? you know where the jackpot's worth
B	yeah
E	the only one that's worth and he was like no I'll just stick with my
B	oh it was on the
E	two thousand
B	very edge?
E	it was right so it wasn't actually teetering over but it was right on the edge
B	mm
E	so if he'd got a good erm a well placed thing
B	they did it when they did the
E	they didn't they didn't do it
B	oh but they usually do a thing at the end
E	well they didn't do that that's what I thought they should do that cos that
B	well they do usually
E	well I don't know why they didn't do that
B	oh
E	didn't do it he went oh well here he is three thousand pounds
B	oh that's odd
E	that's
B	mm
E	erm but yeah they
B	oh
E	he was doing Pointless as well and he said well and what happened was that the two shows that he was on just got scheduled for the same day and they said if they'd told if he'd told us we would have scheduled his show for a different day
B	oh
E	so in the end he you know his show was on twice and he was wearing the same jumper apparently on both of them
E	and he did them both on the same day
B	I'd like to do Pointless
E	well let's enter then
B	er yeah I think you and I should
E	shall we? just do it now
B	okay
E	right where's the computer?
B	James Hunt
E	never heard of him and
B	Michael Schumacher isn't
E	is he not British?
B	British though he's German
E	I thought he was British though
E	oh well see I would have
B	what's happened with him is he?
E	he is stable but I think he's he can't talk or walk or anything he's
B	oh god
E	I don't know if he'll if he's you know gonna get better or whether it's just gonna take a long time or whether it's
B	mm
E	that's that
B	mm
E	erm
B	no he's German Michael Schumacher
E	oh right so I'd would have said and looked like a right idiot
B	James Hunt Lewis Hamilton and erm
E	oh Niki Lauda
B	Niki
E	did he win?
B	but I'm not sure if he's British Niki Lauda is he?
E	oh I dunno
B	erm Graham Hill
E	yeah someone said Graham Hill that was quite a good one
B	mm
E	there was
B	did anyone say James Hunt?
E	no no one said James Hunt
B	Damon Hill? did he
E	someone said Damien Hill and he also apparently they're the only two
B	mm
E	yeah someone said him that was quite a low one as well but someone said
B	yeah
E	and then the
B	yeah
B	yeah
E	scoring answers
B	yeah
E	so they both got a hundred and twelve points
E	and they were out
E	so enter Pointless
B	oh which one's are down?
E	lots there are things like Escape to the Country or Bargain Hunt
B	oh I don't want those
E	or
B	oh no I don't want any of those
E	where is it then?
B	well that's BBC1 there that one there
E	oh maybe it's not that one
B	oh
E	oh we must have missed
B	until when?
E	it doesn't say I guess it just open as and when
E	where? where does it say that?
B	nationwide auditions for
E	oh yeah so I guess their applications are closed aren't they? oh disappointing shall we apply to go on The Chase?
B	you've already been on The Chase can you do it twice?
E	yeah they said you can enter as many times as you want and they said don't be
