A	is this your spicy chutney spicy green chutney
B	no that isn't we had that bought for us
A	bought for you?
B	not bought for us made for us made for us as a Christmas present
A	mm good
B	not that spicy actually
A	no
C	no no
B	quite nice though
A	tasty
C	mm
C	ah we had a good meal last night
B	yeah
A	I noticed that erm Loyd Grossman sauces were half price in Co-op
B	oh right
A	pound a bottle
B	oh
A	and at that price you can't make it can you?
B	you can't make it no you can't
A	price
B	yeah
A	and you you know when I go out and buy like a pepper cost you eighty-nine P
B	that's right
A	yeah before you start
C	mm
B	yeah
C	so what sauces were they?
A	well this one was a bolognese sauce and er I grilled some bacon and then cut that into little bits and stuck it in the sauce and like the sauce you only have to
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and pour over pasta god that's absolutely gorgeous
C	mm
A	it really was
C	mm
A	I quite often use the curry
B	do you? I've never had Loyd Grossman but the one that
C	never had them
A	the thing is that that they're small bottles so it's only really enough for two people
B	yeah
A	well it's enough for three people really cos I always get a meal the next day out of it as well when
B	yeah
A	and we but they aren't very hot curries
B	no
A	cos I always buy something like tikka masala that's that's strong but not hot but
B	yeah
A	I've been adding curry powder to it as well
B	really?
A	to get it in but it tastes good no yeah the thing is you can go through all these different makes and that but you know I I always every now and again his sauces are on half price and it's really worth it
B	yeah yeah
A	for a quid a go
B	we buy them Red Dragon ones
C	we've got a couple haven't we? erm
B	is it Red Dragon?
C	chicken tikka haven't we?
B	mm
C	yeah
B	and they were half price weren't they? when we bought them
C	mm we never tried Loyd Grossman though
B	yeah
C	try them
A	yeah but they're they're usually two quid a bottle you see
B	yeah
A	which is a little bit dear
B	yeah
A	well it's not that dear I don't suppose but yeah it's sort of a lot dearer than one quid
B	well of course it is double the price is different
C	so were they in Morrison's did you say? no
A	I think these kind were in the Co-op
C	the Co-op oh yeah
A	in the Co-op trouble is they have these offers on when you go in there and
B	then they're gone
A	they're all gone they don't seem to
C	yeah
B	tell you that they have gone
A	yeah
B	they they they have all the posters up outside don't they?
A	yeah
B	telling you all about them
A	no I was waiting for this bit of bread to melt
C	oh
B	is it?
C	it is quite solid
A	I need to stand stand the cup of tea on it
B	absolutely
C	we can toast it for you?
A	what? no
C	warm it up in the toaster
B	they are a bit yeah
C	mm
B	pass the Marmite please? I like Marmite
A	so how long is your bread you have your bread in the freezer then?
C	how long?
A	yeah
B	we get three three a day three rounds a day
A	yeah but how many loaves of bread do you make then a week?
C	just
B	just the one
C	probably just the one
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but you don't store?
C	I slice it up you see and them put

B	yeah
A	midday
B	that's it yeah
C	yeah
A	that's surprising
B	it did work
A	it did yeah
B	great I hadn't thought of that one we put it in the toaster or I used to do rolls and stick em on the top of the toaster
C	yeah we used to do small rolls didn't you?
B	mm but when we eat the roll
A	yeah yeah go on
B	we slice it like you would a sandwich
A	ah ha yeah
C	buttered down
B	and it one roll will feed us doesn't it?
C	it yeah you think you've got loads too don't you?
B	yeah well the time you put the stuff on from your

A	yeah
B	and we bought three chickens for ten quid
A	uhu
B	and do you know they're the best chickens we've ever had
A	really?
B	yeah they were so delicious weren't they
C	mm they were
B	absolutely delicious free range
A	three for a tenner
B	three three for a tenner yeah
A	blooming heck
C	we've only had one so far
B	and you think Marks and Sparks they're gonna be really expensive don't you?
A	well they do that meal for two for ten quid don't they? or something like that
B	yeah
A	with including bottle of wine
B	bottle of wine yeah
A	no but I know someone who has?
C	yeah are they good?
B	are they good?
A	mm
C	yeah we looked at them and thought mm one day
B	one day
C	it's sounds like a good idea
A	for for your next birthday
A	treat yourself
B	we walked round the food hall
C	getting there isn't it?
B	round the food hall that's a fantastic place innit? the Marks and Sparks food hall
A	dunno never been round it
B	oh you ought to go round
A	is this is
B	in Norwich
A	yeah Red Lion Street or what have you
B	mm
C	mm
B	yeah fantastic place
A	mm
B	it's the first time I've been round the food hall in there
A	yeah I haven't been round there
B	yeah?
C	a new venture for us you see
B	oh and an adventure not a new venture that was a new adventure
C	bring our chicken's home on the bus
B	yeah
A	waving your Marks and Spencer bag
B	bag
C	yep
A	oh yeah
C	that we had to pay for we didn't get
A	we've we've been in to Marks
B	we had to pay for the bag
A	yeah
B	cos we didn't have any bags with us you see we didn't think we would going to go
A	mad
B	mad
A	well you're you had the money on you
C	mm did we have money?
B	yeah you had
C	yeah we had a pound or two
B	you had you had some that you know you were carrying
C	yeah that was it ten pound plonk
B	we got down there for nothing and back for nothing too
C	took our sandwiches as we always do
C	yeah
A	is it?
B	it must be cos I must have left it from
A	oh yes it is I can see it it just goes early but my bus pass won't activate the reader
B	won't it?
A	it's always been I haven't used it recently but
B	so he had to print it in did he?
A	no he cos normally you just sort of
B	mm
A	hold it there and it'll beep
B	yeah
A	and but mine you have to sort of put it like this and move it around until it beeps
A	but it's when er when I went to London you get on a bus and like your bus pass is valid on the bus and er but you don't know what to do with it what do I do with it? cos apparently you sort of like show the bus driver and he couldn't care less
B	no
A	he doesn't have any contact with the passengers at all they don't even take money now do they?
B	no
C	don't they? no money
B	no they they have them Oyster cards
A	no they they
C	so I couldn't go and pay with money?
A	but you've got a bus pass haven't you?
B	yeah but
C	yeah but I got on the bus early you never know do you?
A	well you're have you got a credit card?
C	yeah
A	well they
C	oh yeah
A	the radar thing on that one that works as an Oyster card
B	yeah
C	I remember now
A	so you can flash that if you like
C	you're not
A	I mean it's funny innit I mean how do tourists go yeah not enough at all yeah I mean okay people are on a package trip or something
C	yeah
A	they've probably got all this advice in the hotels and stuff like this but when I used to drive around I'd turn up somewhere
C	yeah
A	and you just assume you know money buys stuff
C	you do
A	no the the
C	you have to
B	pay on the net
C	you have to book it first don't you?
A	mm that's right if if you cross the bridge
C	well that how do you know you're gonna cross the bridge really
A	well if you planned your journey innit
B	yeah
A	but you can
C	I know but
A	you can phone up and do it on on your phone
B	can you?
A	yeah apparently it's all these sort of you know mobile phone numbers and you
B	yeah
A	phone em up before midnight
B	oh right
C	and cos erm
B	only on a smartphone though we haven't got a smartphone
A	dunno dunno I suppose
C	no when friends came at at Christmas time he had to rush off the next day to because he had to pay it before midday or something
B	yeah he had to go to Norwich or
C	otherwise there's a huge fine
A	mm
C	yeah
C	it isn't very nice is it?
A	but there is local places isn't there if you there's one in
C	is there?
A	yeah
C	it just seems
A	I can't remember where it is but it's on somewhere like erm er the newspaper shop
B	yeah
A	Ideal News or something like that
C	yeah pay zone or something
A	yeah
B	oh you can pay at the barber shop can't you? that's got pay zone
C	probably I don't know
A	up where?
B	in
A	yeah could well be
C	in that shop
C	it just seems a daft
A	but you you know if you're gonna do one or two journeys in a year you can sort of pay for five or six and it lasts a year
B	can you?
A	you know what I mean? you don't have to
C	oh I see
A	but then it's this thing that they're clocking your they're clocking your car and where you're going aren't they?
B	yeah
A	you know and you think
C	yeah
A	you know they you know people have become quite blas√© towards this sort of constant sort of surveillance don't they?
B	they do yeah and I I saw Police Camera Action I don't know if you've ever seen that?
A	mm
B	they followed this car not by another car not by following em they followed em from London to Birmingham to I think Edinburgh in the end
A	all on camera
B	all on camera they followed this car because he he'd er they'd broken into somewhere and
A	yeah
B	and they they didn't want to catch him till they knew where he was going
A	mm
B	and er they actually followed him into his own garage
A	crikey I mean they've just put
C	mm
A	one of them cameras up outside
B	have they?
A	mm
C	oh
A	looking across the road into the
C	oh right
A	so everyone who goes into
C	oh why is it?
B	well that's
A	well the
C	yeah yeah
B	oh right
A	and there's always a load of trouble there
B	really
A	well not always
B	they're lovely places aren't they?
A	not always a load of trouble but more trouble than the average suburban street
B	yeah
A	and like there's all drug dealers and stuff getting down there
B	really
A	and er and also the the erm what do you call it the third bank
B	yeah
A	is in that
B	oh
A	right? so they're now clocking everyone who goes goes phone bank and
C	mm
A	and you think how you know it just suddenly appeared one day
B	yeah
A	and you think well where did the permission come for this?
B	yeah
A	and who did it and who is looking at who
B	yeah
A	and what about all the you know the private places in the
B	yeah
A	it's like where should they be
B	clocked all the time
A	clocked all the time
C	they might do won't they?
A	but the worst thing is it's at the food bank I mean it's bad enough stigma
B	to have to go
C	mm
A	they're really embarrassed having to go to
C	yeah
A	and you have to they have to get the ticket from social services and they're only allowed three visits I think to the food bank
C	it's four a year I think
A	four a year yeah four a year
C	like
B	ah anyhow
A	yeah but see a lot of people they're either paying
B	yeah do yeah yeah
C	mm yeah
A	and er if their income source is suddenly cut off
B	yeah
A	it doesn't matter if you've got a Range Rover and a big house and that you can still blooming starve to death
B	you can yeah
C	yeah
A	unless you sell your Range Rover or
B	yeah
A	but then a lot of the time these Range Rovers are are on the never never anyway
B	yeah that's true yeah
A	and even if they handed them back they probably wouldn't get any money
B	not get any money no
C	yeah
B	no
A	I mean it's just
B	yeah
A	yeah you know really you know unless you keep grafting and keeping your nose to the stone
B	yeah
A	if you fall for all this advertising
B	oh crikey yeah
A	and you know all this two holidays a year and don't you deserve this? and you know this new car and stuff like this
B	yeah
A	you know I mean you can I mean these people just walk blindly
B	they do
A	you know their head is in the noose and you know one thing they can't kick against the system because they are rely they need the job
B	yeah
A	you know to get the income
B	yeah
A	and so that keeps them quiet that way and the other thing is is that the people who own these companies you know they can have a board meeting in America oh we'll close that company that and close that down
B	yeah
A	and suddenly you get you know three or four hundred people on the you know with nothing
B	well it's like Tesco's and BP now innit?
A	yeah
B	huh? look what they're now done I mean they're now BP has now sacked loads of people
A	mm
B	because
A	they're closing down big stores and that
B	yeah yeah
A	and you know no matter what people say about these stores they do provide a good income for a lot of people who wouldn't necessarily get a job anywhere else
B	that's right yeah I mean the
A	if you look at the sad acts who live in who work in Morrison's
B	yeah
A	you know they'd never work anywhere else would they?
B	no they wouldn't no no
A	that's right I don't think these companies someone like Tesco's I don't yeah they reckon they've got masses massive land bank
B	they have land bank and
A	like bought up land with the the idea of maybe they'll build stores on them
B	that's right yeah
A	but I don't think that they're worried at all cos they can turn that into a housing for even more money
B	well of course they can even more yeah
A	and I think even like you know when they're sort of building stores and that I think half the company is is interested in expanding the stores and the stuff like that
B	yeah
A	and the other half of the company
B	just in it for the money
A	are building up real estate
B	money money money
A	you know because they're not gonna lose out are they?
B	no
A	you got all that real estate
B	that's right
A	and they you can turn it you know look at
B	yeah
A	if they close that down they could build massive great industrial estate there
B	yeah
A	in that same area
B	and look at the housing they could get there?
A	or houses or anything I mean
B	yeah yeah I mean it's a huge car park innit?
A	it is absolutely massive
B	massive car park
A	yeah and where they build the stores they're only built out of tick tack aren't they?
B	yeah
A	they're like you know steel sheds
B	yeah with a with a roof on
A	I mean when we used to build erm you know units work units
B	yeah
A	you knew you knew that they're only being built for the short term
B	yeah
A	you know cos of how cheap they're built you know it's just like frames with a bit of metal cladding that you can unbolt and you can take them down in a day
B	yeah
A	unbolt and take them offsite
B	that's right yeah
A	cos it's only nuts and bolt holding them together
B	there's there's a
A	they've got plenty of units up
B	yeah
A	keep expanding it as well
B	yeah
A	but yeah I was sort of thinking you know
B	yeah
A	and they were sort of like getting pretty old weren't they?
B	they were yeah
A	they were sort of falling to bits and that
B	yeah
A	and er so that'd be that'd be about seventy year old then
B	yeah
A	whereas now seventy year old houses are the ones built after the war
B	just after the war yeah
C	yeah
A	you know and but you'd think oh that's quite a new house but I mean
B	yeah
A	well so the one built just off ever since then the the the materials have been of poorer quality haven't they?
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	I mean the admittedly there's a lot of houses built in the nineteen hundreds were not very good
B	right then the thirties were supposed to be the best best built houses and of course they became
A	I mean I mean you know they put all the drains are you know plastic piping now
B	yeah
A	well who's to say that in a hundred years' time they had to all sort of go and get you know just sort of crumble away into nothing
B	that's right
A	they're just assuming that plastic was gonna last forever
B	they are yeah
A	and you're thinking well they don't know because it hasn't been invented that long
C	yeah
B	no
C	right
A	you know what I mean? and what would happen if like all the plastic parts in all the houses
B	the plastic plumbing yeah
A	all started you know like decaying
B	yeah
A	due to you know I don't know
B	the lead did years ago didn't it?
A	yeah that's right it crumbles away
B	that crumbled away doesn't it? and people's people's water
A	that's right
B	it's scary that
C	mm
B	no wonder there's a lot of mental people in the world
A	yeah well they reckon this area's alright cos of the calcium
B	the hard water yeah
A	the hard water would put a layer of calcium on the inside
B	that's right
A	to protect it
B	yeah
A	but you go places like Devon and that with soft water
B	yeah
A	then like the soft water actually makes the lead
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	oh dear yeah
B	I mean that's why half of them are mental down there
B	oh dear
A	mm had to have the gasman out the other day
B	did you? when the gasman came to call
A	I hadn't noticed it but when I had my boiler put in there was this guy who was one of these blokes that is sort of very brash sort of big fat cocky young brash you know
B	yeah
A	I mean you know they just come out with such a load of bullshit you know?
B	yeah yeah I know the sort know the sort
A	and er but he was alright you know he knew what he was doing
B	yeah
A	he he got the whole thing up right but he was a bit sort of slap happy
B	yeah
A	and er sort of cheerful Charlie and
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	which went to the house connection
B	I see yeah
A	so this meter was off and apparently there's some new system where they've got to take the top corrugated pipe out and put a solid pipe in so it's rigid like
B	oh right
A	god knows why anyway he did this and made a right mess of sort of soldering up and this sort of stuff
B	did he?
A	well he would yeah I know solder pouring out everywhere you know
B	yeah
A	and er and ever since then this was in the summer there was a faint whiff of gas in the in the boiler in the er not the boiler in the meter cupboard
B	the meter
A	and er nothing much you couldn't smell it outside but if you opened the door to read the meter mm smells a bit of gas
B	didn't need to
A	anyway I erm
B	no
B	not in the winter
A	when it's cold and er so in in the end I thought no I couldn't find the number in the end I found the number phoned up the firm said oh look you know ever since your bloke changed this pipe there's been a bit of a smell of gas in it oh gas oh turn it off open all your windows blah blah blah blah
A	I'm going yeah yeah alright and I'm thinking hang on it's been like this since August
C	well
A	and er you know the sent a bloke round and the same guy came round
B	oh right
A	and they found that there's a little pin hole prick on the other bit of corrugated pipe
B	oh right
A	right cos I thought it was what he'd done
B	yeah
A	and I thought well I don't want to get the gas board out cost they're gonna say no it's your plumber
B	yeah
A	our responsibility ends at the meter you know
B	yeah
A	and they'd probably give him a a black mark on his Corgi registration or something
B	they would wouldn't they yeah?
A	for not doing it right anyway he found it out and he said oh I'd better call
B	yeah
A	he said I he said I've got a smell of gas in the in the
A	blah blah blah open all your window and that
C	oh
A	you know it's just you know
A	we'll have someone round in our know in an hour and sure enough some bloke turned up in an hour
B	yeah
A	and er
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well there's been a lot of people killed
C	yeah
B	blown up yeah
C	yeah
B	was in
C	there's been a street something
B	well it collapsed and oh no that was at the it collapsed and
A	yes it was wasn't it? yes
B	not not the one down it was
A	well it was it was blown up
C	that was the name but I can't remember what happened
A	yes well it was badly built one
B	was all collapsed yeah
A	yeah but I think anyway he comes along and er he checked it with all this sort of super fine stuff and oh yeah there was this pinhole leak in this bit of pipe and he took it out and I said oh can I have a look at it yeah what for? I said I just want to see what's wrong you know and this bit of corrugated pipe is sort of the you know
C	yes
A	it's stainless steel right
B	well
A	and what had happened is is that some solder and some flux from the connection at the top had dripped down and stuck on a bit of this corrugation and rotted straight through it
B	wow
C	ooh
B	rotted through the stainless steel
A	yeah
C	that's not good is it?
B	wow
A	and I said he he said oh yeah it's someone made a messy joint there you know that the flux come down and rotted through and I'm thinking well that can't have been that guy in August cos no way would flux go through a bit of stainless steel in
B	no
C	yeah
A	in you know such a short time
C	mm
A	and you think well it's stainless steel anyway you'd have thought yeah it should be impervious to a bit of I mean flux is acid but I mean yeah there's isn't that much acid there and once the acidic properties are used up there's got to you know it's just limited innit?
C	yeah
B	no you you talk about stainless steel I read on the internet that er you should only buy you should only use American or British or European stainless steel right because they don't they buy from China and that doesn't contain the amount of chromium that it's supposed to contain
A	oh yeah
B	to
A	right
B	because it's done a lot cheaper
A	mm yeah I can believe that so I mean if you if you're getting a place like British Gas buying all their stainless steel from China
A	yeah they have these things made in China
B	yeah
A	which they probably would have done
B	which they probably would have done yeah
A	yeah but it's but then that's their fault for not specifying it properly innit?
B	yeah that is yeah
A	you know if they just specify the stainless steel it probably is stainless on the
B	that is yeah that's right
A	stainless in China
B	yeah
A	it's just very susceptible to
B	that's right certain types of hazard
A	I mean stainless steel you see it's a funny thing it's you can make an infinite variety of stainless steels
B	yes you can
A	well depending on what proportion of what metals you're add to it
B	you use yeah
A	yeah
B	and that was stainless steel was only made by a mistake wasn't it? it was a mistake
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	which was you know lots lots of brilliant inventions were made by a mistake aren't they? you know people leave something
A	well that was on that materials programme wasn't it?
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	yeah I've got the book
B	have you?
A	which the bloke wrote
B	oh right
A	haven't got round to reading much of it yet but
B	I think it's very interesting all that sort of stuff
A	it is yeah
B	yeah I do I do like to watch all these erm documentaries about different bits and pieces all that you know cos
A	yeah well that particular one was a university one wasn't it?
B	yeah Open University they're brilliant
A	they do some really good ones
B	that's Horizon as well they they do a lot of Open University stuff and that is really really good
A	mm
B	they don't do so much now they used to have they used to have an Open University all the time on BBC two
A	yeah at midday didn't it?
B	yeah and that used to be the most interested programmes that were on telly

B	yeah
A	and couldn't find anything that I
B	wanted
A	particularly wanted to watch
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't stretch to watching commercial television on Iplayer cos that drives you round the bend
B	this is why we we do record some of the commercial stuff you know commercial telly because you can flip through the adverts
A	you don't that's right but you can't on Iplayer
B	no I do like to watch erm some of these er homes programmes what are they called? you know where they build fantastic houses

B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I said you but you liar
B	yeah it can't can it?

A	no
B	I mean the
A	yeah but these people insist on fantastic furnishings and fittings and it's not like this

A	oh yeah
B	and then in the in the lounge they've got these big letters again home sweet home and you think no they're dressed that place for that

B	oh yeah what's that called yeah
C	oh yeah

C	they probably throw a bit of rubbish around just to
B	yeah the
C	don't they?
B	poor bloke who had all his garden he did all his garden was hoarded as well all the stuff in his garden he wouldn't let anyone chuck a paper away
A	these are erm
B	is there? oh right
A	I think it's on Quest or something like that
B	oh yeah
A	and no erm yeah these people aren't quite so bad as that Polish German guy who had stacked up to the ceiling with
C	yeah
B	that's it
C	yeah sort of like a garden full of sacks of rubbish he'd collect up
B	that's it
A	and take home
B	put in his garden
A	yeah but there's sort of these American people yeah they're always bad
B	aren't they? yeah
A	there was this one woman who had er sort of a hundred and fifty cats
B	oh god
A	and you know her house was just that cat cage innit?
B	yeah
A	and these cats were like living there and breeding there and there was another one this guy
B	that must have stunk
A	this other guy this er American ex-serviceman he was sort of a biker
B	yeah
A	and his house was full of pet rats
B	was it?
A	absolutely full you now these er pictures you see in India where they
B	yeah the
A	there's some temple
B	where the rats are running free
A	they worship the rats
B	they run all the feet everywhere er?
A	they bring them food
B	that's it yeah
A	religious well this house is a bit like that
B	wow
A	bloody rats everywhere
C	wow
A	they're all got in the walls and they're running around and
C	but the smell of rats is awful
A	of the smell of rats is horrible innit? yeah
A	but for him you see they were you know cos he was sort of psychologically damaged being in the American army
B	yeah yeah
A	and that was his lifeline really
B	he could watch em
A	it was something like that
C	he didn't mind them being there at all?
A	no he he looked out for them
C	he really gosh
A	they were his rats
C	yeah
A	and it all was to do with I think his his girlfriend died or something in a car crash
B	oh I see
A	and er she has a couple of pet rats or something
B	oh I see
A	just expanded the pet rats till it was several hundred and he was a he was a real meaty fella you know sort of big
B	big blue
A	ah yeah and er they were sort of saying well we've got to get rid of these rats no one's touching my rats you think hang on a minute
A	and they're sort of were trying to persuade him in in the end they did persuade him but even to he was still a bit iffy whether he was going to let anyone
B	no?
A	they you know captured em live I expect they killed em
B	course they did yeah
A	but as far as she was concerned
B	they were going to a better home
A	they were going to
B	yeah
B	did did you hear about that little boy who shot his mum? and his dad a the same time with one bullet
A	yeah serves him right I think
B	he he opened he opened this woman's hand bag didn't he?
A	well there was another one about a couple of weeks previously wasn't there?
B	yeah yeah
A	where some kid was his mum was shopping and he rummaged in her handbag and shot
B	oh no he shot himself didn't he?
A	shot himself yeah
B	ah
B	the Yankee way of life
A	well there was one police chief who said er as far as this state is concerned if you want personal
B	oh that doesn't
A	so they a lot of these states they used to have this law that said if you have a firearm in a public area you've got to carry it openly
B	oh I see yeah
A	and they've since passed laws saying that you're allowed to carry a hidden firearm
B	oh right
A	in a in a public area so it means that you can women can carry a gun in the bag or a bloke could have a sort of a holster yeah
B	holster yeah
A	a you know a shoulder holster or a hip holster and so you don't know when you're talking to someone whether they've got a blooming gun on em or not
B	that's great innit? cos they they invented all
A	they were yeah see that's the sort of gun you want something that won't kill you
B	yeah
A	but would do you a bit of damage
B	yeah
A	but modern guns oh dear
B	yeah
A	they just wipe you out
B	yeah well it's the bullet that'll wipe you out isn't it? cos they make these special bullets that just that just implode inside you
A	inside there's these like dumb dumb bullets where where erm
B	make a bigger hole when they're coming out than when they went I
A	yeah well they were banned under the Geneva Convention
B	mm
A	but in America you can still buy hollow-point bullets which is exactly the same
B	yeah
A	they just expand when they hit you
B	yeah god that's awful isn't it?
A	yeah they're sort of made for hunting really
B	yeah
A	the idea is that the animal you hit doesn't
B	get away
A	run around and
B	get injured yeah
A	and they can yeah they can fit all the guns in you know that people are using
B	it's terrible innit?
C	yeah
B	I'm glad we don't keep guns in this country cos there's some mad hatters about I mean the
A	there is
B	mad hatters about
A	when you get bad enough you know people running amuck who shouldn't have you know you can
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	what what would've happened during the riots in Liverpool and Manchester and and all that a few years ago when if they'd had guns? it was bad enough when they're
A	well they had guns in Northern Ireland
B	they did yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yes
A	major IRA protest about something
B	yeah and they drove up
A	and they accidently got in this in this crown
B	they did didn't they? yeah
A	and they dragged em up didn't they?
B	that was right yeah
A	and this guy one of em had a pulled a handgun out out of the glove compartment but they dragged him out of the car and he didn't shoot at anyone I think he shot in the air or something like that but they didn't
B	yeah yeah that's it yeah
A	it was
B	they tried to reverse out of it all
A	that's right yeah they were absolutely surrounded they were and
B	yeah
A	but there was no
B	no no after stuff
A	no great thing like nowadays like with that guy that oh he Banton who got stabbed to death
B	oh yeah
A	you know all the fuss about him
B	yeah that went forever doesn't it?
A	yeah still going on
B	and they still go on about it
A	yeah you know and sort of as part of the terrorist thing you know be scared be very scared
B	well it didn't matter so much
A	it didn't matter but they were like two army blokes
B	that's right yeah
A	you know just like
B	yeah it's awful innit?
A	yeah
B	but there you go this these things happen and if I've always said if you join the army you've got to expect stuff like that
A	well exactly
B	so I mean if you're going in the army you're going a you're being trained to kill
A	yeah I mean they there's an article the other day about this you know that American there's an American film come out called American Sniper or something
B	oh it was a Jyong Kun Jong or in in Korea?
A	no no no no not that no this is
B	oh of course
A	Nazi man himself
B	how proud he must be
A	a
B	oh dear
A	something like that and er but when he left the army he got shot by this other American guy he had befriended well this
B	yeah
A	and er he had befriended this
B	in Afghanistan
A	right in Afghanistan
B	yeah
A	and he was sort of like totally weird you know out of his head
B	yeah
A	and er this sniper bloke used to run
B	oh right
A	you know for ex-vets
B	yeah
A	cos it sort of like helped to sort of like keep them on the straight and narrow of you know doing target practice you know
C	mm
A	gives them some sort of tie in to their previous life you know
B	oh god yeah
A	yeah and this chap was shot him and his mate and their trial was coming up but anyway the whole thing about it was is that this film which is a real redneck all-American you know we're so great
B	John Wayne type of thing
A	yeah we've got this bloke who can kill a hundred and something you know Taliban whether or not he knew they were Taliban from you know
B	that's right
A	nine hundred nine hundred yards away
B	that's right yeah
A	and like you know and he just sort of like would pop them off and he was made into a hero but then
B	oh god
A	who'd killed even more people
C	yeah
A	in Afghanistan and they're sort of saying oh our true hero you know he's the world record holder not this American guy
B	it's like how to make people hate you innit?
A	yeah
B	how to make a people hate you a whole people you know it at well we don't
A	exactly
B	I mean it's a wonder any Muslims like us
A	in in all these in all these wars like in the Balkans and that like the the snipers are the most hated
B	yeah
A	people there because they were
B	that's right yeah
A	and you know if you walked across the street to the bakers you're taking your life in your hands
B	five-year-old girl got just got shot
A	it's one of these sniper guys might just
B	that's right yeah
A	whereas when he's on our side so called you know they're heroes
B	yeah it's all wrong
A	and then when you think about it they're the most cowardly aren't they? cos they've not got face to face
B	well they're they're hiding away from it all aren't they?
C	yeah
A	yeah they're not putting themselves in danger
B	there was a a a bloke erm in in World War Two he had shot down and bombed most most of the lot hero right? but he said I weren't killing anybody I was just dropping bombs he said and until you see what you've done
A	oh I see you mean he was a bomber pilot
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and he said until you see what you've done and what
A	that's right
C	see
A	that's exactly right yeah hand to hand try you know trying to prevent someone sticking a bayonet in you
B	yeah
A	or you've got to stick the bayonet in them like in the First World War
B	yeah
A	well you know
B	yeah that that was
A	I mean that was must be not matter how well you're trying
B	yeah
A	to actually go up to a fellow human being and stick a bayonets in them that's
B	yeah my dad got a bayonet in er in Norway got through through right through his shoulder he never did talk about it mum told me about it but he never talked about it cos she reckon he killed the bloke who did it you see
A	yeah
B	and he he never spoke about the war
A	what was he doing in Norway
C	well he wouldn't do
B	he was on the lights in Norway
A	what's that?
B	the what do they call em
C	search lights?
A	search lights?
B	search lights yeah that's all war he was doing and he got raided you know they they came in at him
A	mm
B	and that was that but there you go he never said about it mum told me about it but that was it now we get a Christmas tree every year from them
A	yeah
B	no it's
A	would they have a tree in Norwich outside the city hall I suppose
B	yeah that's about it
A	I can't remember seeing it there?
B	it's always outside the city hall innit that big old tree?
A	the Norwegian tree
B	yeah
C	is it?
B	yeah I know they've got one in Trafalgar Square is it Trafalgar Square
C	Trafalgar Square mm maybe
B	yeah it's come from Norway
A	well there is a tree I thought that was the Norwich tree but it probably more likely be a Trafalgar Square tree
B	yeah
A	probably most of them come from Norway
B	yeah
C	Norwich one'll be from Thetford won't it?
B	Norway spruce isn't it?
A	the Norwich one from Thetford
C	I should think so wasn't it?
A	I don't know if it was gift you see
B	you thought it'd be a gift
A	from the Norwegian people
C	not not the one in Norwich
A	I don't know I thought it must be
C	yeah they only do the I think they only do the Trafalgar Square one
A	do they I don't know?
B	we'll have to find out we'll have to look it up
A	mm
B	we'll have to Google it
C	I don't think they send them all over the place
B	no
A	mm to to I can't think of any connections with Norwich
B	no I can't only the N O
A	what Norwich and Norway
C	yeah
A	not yet well probably
C	probable isn't it from people in supermarkets and there's guns and stuff
B	yeah
C	mm
B	ha we've been having I've got I've got a bird feeder outside there and you just sort of see them
C	that's a bit of a change
B	well we changed
A	yeah I they they live in flocks don't they?
B	yeah they the most we've had is ten hanging on one bird feeder
A	that's not bad see you get many a lot more well I suppose cos I'm in town you I get hardly any birds come from my feeders other than sparrows
C	yeah
A	I did get a flock of tits cos the roam around in flocks don't they?
B	they do yeah yeah
A	sort of finches and tits
B	yeah yeah
A	cos the other day there was a jay sitting in the top of one of the trees where we
B	oh right yeah
A	making a terrible noise
B	they make a racket don't they yeah?
A	and er suddenly this flock of birds flew out and there's probably about twenty or so of them and there was just all sorts of finches and tits and things all there together
B	yeah

C	mm
B	yeah
A	whereas you know like fifty years ago that used to just be one long road of decay down there
B	yeah yeah
A	everywhere was just falling down
B	well funny when we first come to
C	mm
B	thousand pound
A	mm
B	and er along the main road
C	mm
B	they had this big length of er cottages they were a thousand pound for sale a thousand quid and er which one
C	which was way out of our price anyways
B	we we couldn't afford it anyway I mean we we relooking at them place thinking a thousand quid look at that and they're falling down
A	mm
C	yeah but it you know
B	that's what the people do out don't they? they buy places and do em up

A	yeah sorry two hundred thousand
C	that was a long
B	and
C	and they were moving to Yorkshire
A	got two hundred thousand then
C	mm
B	but they did make a lovely job of it
C	I suppose there wasn't much
B	I don't really know

B	yeah they got a huge bridge to it
A	does it actually go there?
B	yeah and it get yeah it's a massive bridge and
C	mm
B	and er there are more people leaving the Isle of Skye than there is going right and they show you round all these houses and they are they're just empty and
A	yeah well that is
B	you know
A	well that is the same innit like all the crofts and that in Scotland they're all just a bit of
B	well that's right
C	yeah
A	what's the point? just there's no work there you know
B	there's no work
C	mm
A	but I'll tell you what though there's a
B	second home owners who buy em you know

B	yeah
A	you know it must have been say
B	yeah
A	and all these houses built around in this sort of arc around this bay
B	oh wow
B	yeah
A	and it looked fantastic sort of place to you know to go on holiday to
B	yeah
A	cos you had all this sand and that and then you had and everything was you know the sea was like
B	yeah they didn't have pink and blue houses did they?
A	no

A	right
B	that's in Scotland
A	Balamory
A	oh I see what you mean yes
C	there's quite a lot of houses yeah but they would be awful looking houses
A	well you can imagine these place get a bit boring after
B	mm
A	after four weeks
B	yeah yeah
A	well they must do unless you've got to go out fishing and to feed your family
B	well that's right yeah now do you know I I'd
A	if you liked water you wouldn't mind being a fisherman?
B	no absolutely yeah
A	well they can do that off the north of Norfolk
B	you can do it's a bit
A	my erm
C	you could just try it out
A	my my nephew and my brother in law they go on off shore fishing
B	do they?
A	catching mackerel and stuff
B	oh yeah
C	there you are ask if you can go along with them
A	they aren't they aren't that
B	my
A	great a fisherman
B	no?
A	but they my brother in law he likes it more and he takes my nephew out to give him a break from his missus
A	and er yeah they I forget where they go somewhere you know one of these villages up in north Norfolk and they sort of rent a boat out
B	right
A	with I don't know whether they just do it on their own or with a two of three other people you know whether they have a share you know what I mean? and they go out and you know fish
B	I did go shark fishing though in Devon
A	yeah
B	seven quid that cost us to go out didn't even see anything that cost us seven quid to go out there and
A	well it's paying for the boat trip really isn't it?
B	that's it yeah it was shark fishing
A	what you had they give you a rod do they
B	you had a rod
A	oh really?
B	strapped strapped to the
A	boat
B	to the boat
A	and they give you a flag it's rod number seven you are number seven
B	that's it that's the that's it yeah
A	what'll happen if I catch it don't worry we've got a bloke
B	we got a bloke yeah
A	yeah
B	on this boat that was awful that was like every time you hit a wave that was like hitting a hitting your legs against concrete
A	mm
B	that was horrible didn't like it at all so I don't like boats and stuff
C	mm
B	but yeah last time I went on a boat was with
A	well the thing about being on the sea is that unless it's dead calm it's a bit dodgy innit?
B	god that is
A	you know even the slightest swell
B	well you get a three foot swell that's that's that's not
A	yeah
B	that's nothing much that's only that high
A	yeah just rolling in
B	yeah
A	and you're hey whey I remember years ago on boat trips off the beach at Hemsby
B	yeah
A	where
B	yeah
A	that used to be good fun they used to like that
B	yeah
C	mm
A	massive you know quite a big heavy old clinger boat
B	yeah yeah
A	with an inbuilt engine
B	yeah
A	yeah it was
B	I see
A	it would go like that
B	they were not so bad then
B	they could handle the waves couldn't they?
A	they'd just be sort of gentle up er
B	yeah it's the turning round bit and the wave hitting you sideways it's got to turn around
A	ha ha ha
B	to come back
A	that's right
B	oh and if a big wave hit you sideways you you're that's horrible
A	I'm sure you must've only done it on calm days
B	yeah he must have done yeah
A	they must have been feed
B	yeah
A	cos they had a sort of wooden plate thing
B	yeah
A	which he used to roll into the sea so you didn't get your feet wet
B	yeah it's like at Wells you can still you can still go out at Wells can't you? on these boat trips
A	yeah see the seals things yeah
B	yeah yeah we went with
C	yes we did
B	went with
A	the seals do?
B	they really yeah and we got out there and I and I didn't have a memory stick in my camera
A	well you you hadn't been down to
B	no but
C	no we haven't
B	we keep meaning to go down there
C	yeah
B	we keep meaning to go down
A	well the thing is
B	they have pups now don't they?
C	that's the time of year now isn't it?
A	what?
C	is it the time of year now?
A	well I think
B	I think yeah
A	before Christmas is the time
C	oh right
B	was it? for the pups
A	they like they start disappearing but the thing is you can't get anywhere near it
B	no
A	you know park about three miles away
B	yeah
A	cos like signs on the road every gap everything is clogged up
B	yeah
A	and down at
B	you could
A	and park for free but
B	yeah yeah
A	they've got a parking machine down there now
B	have they? oh god
A	and I bet they haven't levelled it off
B	no you could park in there
A	I mean I can understand
B	if they keep the
A	if the car park was kept up
B	yeah
A	because it costs money don't it? lugging loads of stuff
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	and It think well someone's got to pay for this
B	yeah
A	but I mean there's always a gap always used to be free
B	yeah that did
A	and someone put a gate across it one year didn't they?
B	they did didn't they?
A	and they had to go and get get but that got knocked on the head didn't it?
B	that did yeah
C	put the kettle on
B	we went to er we went to Chesil beach in Dorset but of course it's supposed to be a famous beautiful wonderful er prehistoric type beach innit? we we went there and the we parked on the car park it was four quid wasn't it? to park on that car park
C	er yes
B	something like that
A	yeah
B	you know and we thought well should we pick these up you know? and it it was I mean it was supposed to be a ISI is it? and ISO sorry
A	yeah erm
B	SRS?
A	SSA SS SSI
B	SSO yeah it's supposed to be
A	SSSI
B	yes Site of Special Scientific Interest
A	interest that's it yeah supposed to be that and they're supposed to be really and I have never seen such a filthy beach
B	yeah
A	and then when you go back you have to tip em
B	no when we we we didn't we didn't stay there long we and we went up to the to the bloke in the ticket office and said we're going to have to write to the council about this cos we've never seen such a filth before and he said oh yeah yeah that's your prerogative you do that but I mean the fisherman just left all the lines broken lines with all the hooks and all the lead
A	yeah
B	all the lead weights I mean they had lead weights then they didn't have these new new weights they had lead weights all laying across the beach you tripped over the lines and the rusty tins and
A	yeah
B	and the polythene bags and the and the polythene bottles made everywhere as though there'd be a ship wreck you know
A	oh right they all washed up with the tides you see?
B	well they could have been but there should've been someone clean them up
A	yeah then it would cost you more money though
B	well it does yeah but they that was that was an awful beach and I I mean that's supposed to be as you say and SSS SS S I
A	well one of my favourite beaches I don't like going to any more
B	where's that?
A	at Wales?
B	Wales beach
A	yeah I don't like going there any more
B	well now they've changed that so much haven't they?

A	where did you buy it?
C	Lidl's
A	Lidl's?
B	yeah
A	I'd have thought they'd have took that back
B	we'd have thought they'd have took it back
C	well I couldn't find the receipt and I I'm thinking now that maybe I did throw it away because it was older I don't know cos they looked up I had to put in the little barcode
B	for over three years
C	about three years
A	oh really? this is what time flies you see
C	I know
A	it's like oh I it was the other day a couple of weeks ago
C	yeah they had to take my word for it didn't they?
A	oh actually actually three years ago
B	we thought that was only a few months ago? well a year ago
C	to be honest I
A	I bet you can't mend it anyway
C	mm?
A	I bet the
C	yeah
A	you can't mend them
C	it it it heats up just doesn't pull the thing through
A	yeah
B	it the the motor doesn't work
C	that's all yeah yeah
A	but does it whir or anything?
B	no nothing happens
A	mm
B	I've had a I've had a look at it
A	have you had it to bits?
B	I haven't had it broken to bits no
C	that's
A	oh I see
C	it's supposed to roller it through
A	it started it
C	mm
A	and that was didn't
C	it's nothing special I just thought
B	it was only about what was it about nineteen twenty quid wasn't it?
C	mm?
B	that was about nineteen to twenty quid wasn't it?
C	I really couldn't tell you
B	I think it was something like that
C	I
B	twenty-two I've got sort of twenty-two pound in my head
A	mm
B	well at least the milk bottles you got really
A	and where are they?
B	where'd they go they're not making out of thick
A	no no no
B	they bend look
A	and I buy the organic stuff now
B	do you?
A	they got the erm handle on the corner
B	oh right
A	you know rather than on the edge
B	yeah
A	it's on the corner
B	oh
A	and they're a bit more stable
A	I bet the people had a good laugh when you phoned up
C	yeah
B	it's amazing how time do fly though innit?
A	yeah
B	you think you've got a
A	that's like
B	oh crikey
A	and erm she said oh I had twelve thousand a year then that was a lot of money and I said no it wasn't twelve thousand's hardly the minimum wage
B	he didn't pay it then did he?
A	and er she said
C	yeah
A	yeah but it was a long while ago she said and I got child tax credit I says no you didn't she said yeah cos
A	that wage slip is not sixteen years ago and er oh no cos she'd already said it was sort of like two thousand and nine or something like that
B	yeah
A	or two thousand and eight
B	well
A	I said no she wasn't you know
A	oh I was sure that was
B	that's amazing how time do fly though innit? you you think I mean I think back to I haven't got any bloody biscuits what's going on?
A	well you've got chocolates instead
B	chocolates instead
A	well that's right I mean I look at I keep trying to clear up various bits and pieces in my house
B	yeah
A	and I look at stuff and er I've lived there I think nineteen years right
B	you've been there a long while now ain't you?
A	and er I got stuff which I just put in the corner nineteen years ago and never look it never moved since
B	that's right yeah? so you don't need it do you?
A	no
B	that's the same as us we've got stuff up in the loft well I think both lofts we've got the
A	no
B	and we keep saying we must have a clear out of everything we must chuck stuff away my mum and dad never chucked stuff away my dad never chucked stuff away we had to go out and sort their house out and that finished up most of it in the skip
A	yeah well it would do
B	and given to er the old er Help the Aged you know all that and and er we finished up with we finished with
A	mm
B	but most of the stuff wasn't wasn't worth anything
A	well in my loft I have this free insulation put in right?
B	yeah
A	so I don't know how much insulation you got in your loft
B	I only got that much three inches
A	in my loft I got four by twos
B	yeah
A	joist which is level on top of that I got that much
B	wow
A	that's the that's the modern standard four hundred and fifty mil
B	is it?
A	yeah I went up there the other day and er you know I sort of had a look at it trouble is there's so much in there you can't see where the joists are to walk on
B	no
A	but
B	yeah
A	but the trouble is she's got so much junk up there
B	yeah
A	everything she everything she sort of saved you know goes up the loft and there's boxes and boxes of stuff you know and it's can't throw that away that's
B	no it's not
A	it don't insulate at all and er and you sort of think well when the hell are we ever gonna get rid of it?
B	mm
A	yes I think the only thing you can do is to hire a skip go on holiday
B	have someone take it away for you
A	get someone someone in family oh can you come over and get all the stuff out of the loft and chuck it in the skip
B	mm
A	and then that'd be gone whether they collected any of it and took it somewhere or that I don't know but
B	well we started cleaning our loft out didn't we?
C	we did
B	and what did we find up there? empty boxes by the million
C	well that's that's why we got the boxes
B	mm?
C	we were looking for the box to take that thing back
B	yeah we were looking for that box
C	no I know
B	boxes that half the things you bought like like a television in the other room in the motorway there keep the box just in case you got to send it back or something
A	yeah well I've got a front room for the catalogue boxes cos
C	yeah
A	the thing is is that on the very odd occasions which
B	mm
A	but on the odd occasion that she sends someone off sends something off
B	you'll have a box
A	you need to have a box for it
B	yeah
A	and
A	no it's alright I'm fine thanks and trouble is to find the right size box for something it's very hard innit?
B	yeah yeah it is
A	cos invariably the box is alright that way but not the right that way
B	that way yeah
A	or the right that way and huge that way
B	yeah
A	and so I just sort of tend to collect every box I ever get and it's the same with
B	we got hundreds of boxes don't we?
C	we have got a lot of boxes it's good it's good for our bonfire when we get round to it
A	well this is it you know I burnt a load of

B	do you remember days dates?
A	well last Friday I went to have blood tests and they said no no it was yesterday
C	oh really?
A	and I'm sure when I cos I'd I when I'd booked it up it was the previous week on that Monday and you know it was all this oh no can't do one cos I was trying really hard to get one in afternoon
C	yeah
A	they said well we got half past eight in the morning oh sod that
A	and also I didn't want one with this woman called
B	righto right digging in the needle
A	yeah I mean I've had loads so many blood tests you know I'm supposed to have one every month you know for the past sort of fifteen years and when they put the needle in if it goes into the vein you don't hardly feel a thing right
B	no you don't do you?
A	right if it hurts you know it hasn't gone in the vein and this woman
B	I missed yeah
A	and then it's oh I'll have another go
C	er
A	oh there no oh sorry I'll have another go
C	oh dear that's not good
A	one time she did four she had four goes
C	me
A	and she stuck the you know got the needle in so called
C	mm
A	and then you put that
B	sucker in
A	they put that whole vacuum sucker in
B	yeah yeah
A	nothing happened oh it must are a faulty one I'll try another one
B	oh no
C	oh dear
A	and she ended up with a blooming junk full of these things and then said oh well perhaps I'll try the other arm then went in the other arm couldn't do anything there
B	oh crikey
A	went back to this arm
B	have you got big veins or?
A	nah
B	no well mine mine stick up
C	they can never find the vein
A	yeah
B	look at that look so they love em
A	yeah well mine don't mine are aren't big and they've had so many jabs in there's a lot of scar tissue on em
B	oh crikey yeah
A	you know
C	yeah
A	and er but so saying these other two people who do it are brilliant
B	yeah
A	you know they just go straight in bang
B	yeah yeah when was a kid I used to have to go to the Norfolk and Norwich every two weeks cos I had something wrong with my glands and I had to have injections then
A	mm
B	and er there was one particular nurse that really hurt and all the rest of em were brilliant
A	when you go for blood tests at the hospital you know they've got this sort of room there with like a barber shop with about six chairs in it each with a nurse there and there are all people sitting outside and you're just filing in in and
C	really?
A	they just be bop bang bum go on
C	oh dear
A	you hardly feel a thing you know
B	yeah?
A	and like they're just doing it one afar the other bang bang bang bang
C	right
B	I'm supposed to had a blood test last January
A	anyway this this story this woman she was sort of looking through this and she says oh I can do you next Friday okay Friday the twenty-ninth I got this thing on the twenty-ninth so I automatically thought Friday and of course it was Thursday the twenty-ninth
B	my birthday you were on that was my birthday
A	was it?
B	yes
A	oh right where are all the cards then?
C	in the other room
B	in the other room
A	oh
B	yeah
A	and I expect that's another black mark around me but then it was with this
B	so that was okay
A	so I've avoided her no it's funny this woman she's she's awful she's really I mean she's you know friendly enough and always chatty
B	yeah yeah
A	sort of one of these sort of people who always get things wrong so they have to make up by chatty chattiness but she's rubbish I've had you know of all the times she's done the blood test it's never been correct
A	well this is the funny thing I think well perhaps I should complain
B	yeah
C	yeah since there's loads of other people saying the same thing
A	yeah yeah but I mean there there you know but perhaps no one likes to complain
B	this is the trouble we're British
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you never know these days that it might get you a black mark if you complain
B	that's right yeah
A	mm you know

A	yeah
B	it was a Friday night then
B	there was an walk in centre in Norwich yeah
A	I think they were gonna close it down but I think they opened it they moved it somewhere else
B	year
A	but in the old days you'd just look after yourself weren't you?
B	you did didn't you? yeah sore point I mean I
A	enamel
B	enamel enamel one right? and that was holding the
A	not surprisingly being
B	it was a pigsty
A	being a pigsty holding up the muck
B	and I went to went to the doctors doctor
A	yeah
B	and er he just looked at it and he says oh yeah that's just
A	mm
B	and all he did was just spray it with some kind of gunk I don't know what it was you'll be alright don't worry about it and that's it and just change his dressing every couple of weeks or days or whatever and it got better doesn't it? I mean
A	well the thing is with this kid who jammed his finger in the door
B	yeah
A	you know normally you'd just say oh I'll just put a bit of cold
B	that's it yeah
A	something like that you'll be better
B	they would yeah
A	absolutely mad what are you doing what are you eh eh eh
B	yeah yeah
A	say well you know
B	trouble is that that that was the conservatory doors there coming into the house and he was like that holding it and this other little girl shut the door on his finger like that and it didn't take I thought it took the top of finger off cos his finger was in the door but he ripped it away and just ripped the skin off and his nail with it and of course that's when I had to take them up there but they they er they were alright they just bandaged it up and that was it he was alright and er his mum come home in the meantime while I was up there and
A	and a week later you've got a letter solicitor's letter
A	for pain and injury caused on your premises
B	yeah that could've happened
A	we're now claiming a thousand pounds compensation
B	yeah that could've happened
A	yeah
B	but it's likely would happen today
A	well that's what you're up against innit?
B	yeah that probably would've happened
A	anyone get hurt anywhere they'd see it as a money-making deal
B	yeah yeah but what did we have to do
A	mm
B	so we look around well yeah they could trip over and that
A	well this is it they could do anything couldn't they?
B	yeah
A	they could do anything they could climb up anywhere and pull something on top of themselves
B	course they could
A	anything unless you've got everything nailed down
B	yeah so we you had to do this
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean they could push his chair
A	yeah
B	or pull the
A	or fall off again
B	or fall off again
A	yeah
B	I mean they're capable of doing anything picking things you know what kids are like the pick everything up they know how to don't they?
A	but then you know you're getting offices right where you're not allowed to plug anything into a socket without calling the electrician
B	why?
A	maintenance person
B	oh crikey
A	you know if you want to pull some you know disconnect something from the socket and connect something else you're not allowed to do it
B	aren't you?
A	no you have to call call maintenance and
B	well there was a
A	yeah this is not not so much union whatever is it's health and safety
B	health and safety yeah but I mean
A	because they don't think that people who live in a house full of sockets and plus
A	can safely do it when they're working
B	oh dear
A	I mean it is absolutely amazing yeah
B	that's terrible cos I remember the big there was a huge strike at erm
A	uhu
B	or eating a sandwich and he got the bullet and of course everyone come out on strike cos he got the bullet didn't he? and er well they used to go on strike all the time really didn't they?
A	they did well
B	I mean they they booked
A	yeah but if conditions were okay
B	yeah I mean they were working in terrible conditions
A	they wouldn't have gone on strike
B	no no I agree
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	and this is how
B	no they don't you never hear of it no
A	because they have representatives on the board of management
B	yeah yeah
A	and like you know if they've got anything wrong
B	yeah they tell them yeah
A	it's not oh we can't do that it'll cost too much it's you know oh we'll do that cos we'll get better productivity
B	yeah yeah
A	and for years and years and years German's had better productivity than the British didn't they?
B	well of course they did yeah and still have
A	yeah I'm sure they have
B	yeah
A	well since the Japanese car plants have come into being
B	yeah that's it
A	you know you know
B	Toyota and Nissan and it's
A	and so
B	they're all up there in
A	yeah and so it was like people got the idea that you know that they're not against the workers
B	that's right yeah
A	cos that is a a joint effort
B	yeah
A	you know and it the more
B	yeah
A	where there's no one there
B	no there isn't
A	it's just machines whirring away
B	yeah
A	and everything is chopping along
B	yeah
A	they only make engines
B	yeah
A	they don't have any cars do they?
B	they don't make cars do they?
A	they make engines for every plant in Europe though
B	yeah and they used to always be on strike
A	yeah
B	I remember working at erm
A	no chance of that
B	no chance of that
A	cos they got find really good workers didn't they?
B	they did they did yeah
A	and they still went on strike
B	yeah and they said er if we don't get parity with Ford we'll all come out on strike and
A	mm yeah
B	and er he er he said right if you're go on strike you can get out you can get out and you can get out and he sacked the bloody lot of them who wanted to go on strike
B	and because he didn't recognise the unions there was nothing the unions could do about it was there? If they'd have recognised the unions
A	well they did want to go on strike didn't they?
B	every yeah but
A	but there was a lot of that you know I mean it
B	no
A	I mean there was a load of people in the union's bloody power crazy
B	there were yeah yeah
A	who you know couldn't negotiate
B	that's right
A	and if they could
B	yeah what was it there was a joke on television about that the other day
A	have you ever seen that film I'm Alright Jack or It's Alright Jack?
B	yes yes
A	with Peter Sellers in it
B	that's it yeah yeah
B	well that is typical innit that's
A	yeah it's this real snapshot of the time
B	that is yeah
A	yeah I mean if you get away from like the storyline and
B	yeah
A	but just like the sort of essence of the film you know like there's that bit with the forklift truck picks this massive like
B	oh that's right yeah
A	box out and in between there's these four guys going in the car
B	the car
B	yeah
A	what were they doing there? oh they well they were laid off two years ago and that but they've still got to come in
B	well you talk about that I mean I and my my mates at at work were terrible really what we used to do was work like hell I mean literally this is night shifts
A	mm
B	work like hell and build up an a lot of work under the bench during the during the night and then the foreman was in on it too we were and we used to take the next night off and he'd get the workout that week done before
A	oh right
B	and that went on for quite some time cos we were getting well it was a lot of money than a half and our half a crown in our boots we were getting something leak six and six and a half which was the basic wage at that time but the bonuses were really good
A	mm
B	and we did that you know?
A	yeah
B	at it was cheating it was horrible it was wrong but at the time I suppose I was about twenty-six
A	yeah
B	the foreman was in on it like
A	yeah
B	all the all the all the whole lot and some people even went to sleep on the night shift
A	well when I worked
