A	very nice chap
B	mm
A	but he was always you know very friendly and jovial
C	yeah
B	yeah?
A	took us us all round this sort of renovated place
B	no
A	he was quite amazed then turns to me and says oh did you know that? I said yeah
A	and I said where they built the R one 0 one
B	yeah
A	and this bloke who was there he didn't
B	mm
A	and er afterwards I thought mm was it the one 0 one what was built there?
A	I don't know cos I'm on village sign
B	yeah
A	all the others
B	yeah
A	were going to South Africa wasn't it?
B	that's it yeah
C	mm
A	it
B	mm
A	and er
B	ah
A	and you would I I was sort of thinking about it if that was if the one 0 one was built there
C	they'd have put it on
B	they'd have put that on
A	that that would've been the one what was on the sign I'd have thought but
B	yeah
A	but then I dunno if this bloke didn't know
A	being knowing what I was talking about
C	mm
A	that's what I
B	oh
A	R one 0 one
C	find out
A	no it wasn't built there
A	and I'll sort of go
B	oh
C	mm
A	you know it doesn't really matter you know
A	but yeah whatever I say
B	she look it up now does she?
A	she looks it up now cos there's so so
A	often I've sort of said things which have
A	turned out to be wrong but with such an air of authority about it that
B	yeah
A	so I'm even like doubting my own
B	knowledge now
A	knowledge
C	oh dear
B	well er
A	mm
B	you know? and you think what? then where did it from? or have I got that completely?
A	well this is the funny thing ain't it?
C	mm
A	some stories you hear like when you're a kid
C	yeah
B	mm
A	like an uncle might say something
B	you do
A	and then you find out that
C	and er yeah
A	it wasn't really
B	it wasn't right
C	I was convinced Florence Nightingale was part of our family
C	and I told everyone
A	and she wasn't?
C	apparently not
C	no
B	well she could've been
C	er she could've been but
A	was your family called Nightingale?
C	well I'm only taking their word for it that she wasn't now
B	yeah course you are
A	mm
C	mm
B	well you'd have to you'd have to
C	look it up
B	go er go into that Ancestry thing
C	mm
B	that cost a
A	well
B	not an
A	mm
C	there are
A	it's like the army sites and things like that
B	mm
A	have all opened up and the censuses
B	yeah? yeah
C	does it? oh
A	and like yeah obviously if you wanna do more than ten searches
B	yeah
C	mm
A	well it's erm you know it is a
C	gives you a start doesn't it?
A	you know it's not a fiver for ten searches but
C	mm
A	it's that sort of
B	yeah
A	and you know they give you like
C	mm
A	it might be a fiver for one day or something like that so
B	yeah yeah
A	something like that I'm not sure but
B	mm
A	and you'd have to sign up for all of these different sites
B	you do yeah
C	mm
B	cos they'll go so far
A	mm
B	they'll go so far and then say that'll cost you extra if you want to go to there
A	oh right yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah there's one yeah there's several sites I know
B	yeah
A	but I mean my family history's all been worked or my father's family history was all worked out by someone else anyway
B	was it? oh that was alright
C	yeah
A	and I think you'll find that as well
C	yeah our family my
A	the more more yeah well if you look into it you sort of contact someone with the same name
C	mm
A	and they say oh well we've already done all this you know
B	yeah
A	we'll send you the
C	yeah my cousin's done it in great detail hasn't he?
A	mm
B	he's
A	oh right
C	but that's kind of he has worked very hard on it you think mm that's not really fair is it
B	and and the er
A	can't won't he won't he just send you a copy?
C	yeah
B	mm probably will if you ask him
A	or what you wanna do is ask him whether you could borrow it
C	mm?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	to to
B	mm
A	and then make make your own copy
C	well he's very keen isn't he?
B	yeah
C	he's very keen all the time you know he brings something
B	well he went back to this big family
C	oh the
A	oh right
C	er they are the longest running
B	the
C	they're still going
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and yeah they are still going yeah
C	from great-great-great-grandma
B	and the family well
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah so we can go quite right the way back really
A	mm
B	mm
A	and erm she worked it out you know right back to I think it's something like sixteen eighty ain't it? when the parish records first began
B	yeah
A	and you know to get back past that it's quite difficult unless you are related to some
B	yeah
B	yeah lords or ladies or whatever
A	who who erm kept records and
B	mm
A	of course when they sold land or passed land down
B	yeah
A	you could go down through the wills
B	yeah
A	you know cos er they all had to have wills and these little documents
C	yeah
A	so you can go back past this sort of this cut of point of
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but it's much more difficult
B	mm
A	and like when you consider most people don't come from the aristocracy anyway
A	well so they're saying most people are related to everyone else anyway aren't they?
B	yeah
A	cos they reckon if you go back far enough you're related to everybody
B	well there's supposed to have only been two families in this in this whole world and
A	mm well that's you know one theory but that's been changed recently
B	that's been changed has it?
A	yeah
B	oh well they decided it was two families
C	mm
B	one from Africa and one from Europe
A	mm
B	and that was it
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but they're finding out more and more about
C	mm yeah
B	but there can't have been two
C	be more than that
B	the diversity of looks would you? I mean your Chinese and and er Japanese
A	yeah well the Chinese the latest theory is is that the you know they all reckon that there was a migration out of Africa
B	mm
A	but already in Europe was Neanderthal
B	yeah
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	mm
A	but sort of North Asia
C	right
B	yeah
A	that sort of area and they were the Denisovans
B	was it?
A	right? who were?
C	mm
A	this other sorta offshoot of Neanderthal Denisovans
B	there must've been mustn't there?
A	cos they were very sorta similar types
B	I mean it happened in
A	they were a very sorta similar type of
C	yeah
A	people but but now they're saying that something like half a million years before that there was this other branch of people came out of Africa which is also modern man which then went up round the coast of Asia India China through the the straits you know all the
B	yeah
A	all the islands
B	yeah
A	it's you know I mean
B	well they said that the
A	when they talk about people coming out of Africa they aren't talking about like one bloke?
B	no they're not
A	with his wife you know what I mean?
B	well
A	you're you're talking about you know sort of
C	mm
A	well you're talking about hundreds over
B	of course you are yeah
A	time span of hundreds if not thousands of years
B	cos they've thought the Inuits
C	you think yeah
B	they came from er China
A	I don't know but they reckon that it's like the North American and South American Indians they don't know er how they got there now
B	no
A	you know they sort of always assumed they came in at you know a certain period in time and sort of started
C	mm
A	colonising
B	mm
A	er North America
C	mm
A	and slowly moving down into South America
B	mm
A	and they said oh well perhaps they weren't the first perhaps there was these other ones
B	yeah
A	cos they reckon
C	mm
B	yeah cos there's cos erm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	alteration
C	mm
A	in the DNA
B	mm
A	you know what I mean? it's just miniscule so like the
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	the facial characteristics and like like you can't really
B	no
C	mm
A	you can't really sort of go by that I mean to a certain extent you can because they've probably got genes that don't happen somewhere else you know but
B	mm
A	you never know you see er you could get just like one gene suddenly alters
B	yeah
A	right? and that gene is sort of carried on and you know through thousands of years it just takes over er you know if there's a particularly strong gene
B	mm
A	cos that's what they reckon don't they? they reckon some genes are stronger than others and er
B	they do and I remember when we were at school we were doing we were doing er that type of thing and this teacher
C	oh I heard that
B	you heard that have you?
C	yeah I don't see how you can think that
C	weird isn't it?
B	and we said where? he said it'll that'll become at this end
A	mm
B	so why
A	mm
B	and that work well don't it?
A	mm
B	why would you want another one?
C	mm
B	because
A	no
B	that'd get in the way wouldn't it?
A	well the thing is is that there's plenty of people who've been born with a mutation with an extra finger
C	mm
B	yeah
A	or an extra toe
B	yeah or even webbed hands
A	but that hasn't taken off has it? it hasn't like
B	no
B	no
A	hasn't sort of spread through at all
C	but did we descend from the apes? or not? for a start off I mean where do they?
B	what are we looking at?
A	oh there's a buzzard outside
B	yeah there is a buzzard about here yeah
C	and where did the apes come from?
B	what?
C	did we descend from the apes? and where did the apes come from? you know
A	well no
B	mm
C	well where do we come from?
A	he said that it's a diversion from the
B	yeah
A	like you know you get this sort of tree where these sort of divergent species come off and like right at the top
C	mm
A	there's sort of man went one way and apes went the other way
B	yeah
A	so they didn't sorta like apes and then man came from the apes
C	yeah
B	well they've found a
A	well that was a long while ago er that was Lucy
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but she's got the er
A	mm
B	and she er
A	yeah but you see the whole thing about this business if you read something one year
B	yeah
A	the next year it's just totally different
C	yeah
A	cos there was this really famous erm
B	do you want another one
A	no that's alright you have it
B	good
A	there was this really famous archaeologist right?
B	yeah
A	I think his name was Skinner
B	yeah
A	early skulls
B	yeah
A	we're talking about skulls from
B	donkey's years ago yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	or more years ago
B	mm
A	and he became this massive in later life a massive expert on you know human history
B	yeah
A	you know ancient human history and how
B	oh right
A	cos he'd he'd worked on these skulls and he'd he had these new theories where he could date them and relate them and stuff like this from you know the different aspects of them
B	mm
A	like the teeth and the and er cheekbones and god knows what you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	and and he'd sorta spend all his life you know you know dedicated to this branch and you know he was wildly acclaimed because
B	yeah
A	he sorted it you know he sort of more or less solved loads of sorta theories or he didn't solve em but he gave a basis for other people to judge against and stuff like that
B	mm proved them yeah
A	and then about I suppose ten year ago when they brought in DNA testing
B	yeah
A	and stuff like that
B	yeah it would do erm well yeah
A	cos you know you can do
A	testing and not only DNA but they can
B	oh
A	like teeth are the most indestructible thing apparently
B	they are aren't they? yeah
A	and er you can grind them up and do isotope analysis on em
B	oh can you? oh right
A	and tell where the people were born where you know where they lived
B	all
A	and
B	you do yeah
A	traces of these er earth isotopes
A	when you're eating and you know cos in er the construction of your teeth
C	mm
A	and er but he was really pleased you know you'd think he'd be you know gutted
B	devastated
B	yeah
A	all his work was for you know he could've just sat at home and
C	mm
A	yeah
B	but er
A	but he was really pleased cos he was a scientist and
B	yeah
B	yes I suppose
A	is things being being able to prove things or test things and what have you
B	prove things yeah
A	well
B	they are aren't they yeah?
C	mm
A	and also in Holland
B	yeah there's erm
A	they was quite a few er you know
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and you know cos er now they cos like er I think when they were deposited
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure whether that was that long ago
B	it would be
A	well anyway yeah they're sort of now the problem is is er well the thing they're trying to work out is what they're doing you know why they were there you know?
B	yeah
A	cos they don't know whether they were sacrifices or
B	that's right
C	mm
A	or whether they were criminals or
B	yeah
B	oh crikey
A	you know
B	yeah
A	have been in peat bogs
B	oh well
C	mm
B	but there there was a rumour er I don't know how true this is but you know
A	mm
B	there used to be a big
A	mm
B	but they reckon that when they open these lead caskets these people were seven foot tall
B	and all it was was a load of jelly inside
A	mm
B	you know all melted cos there was no air or anything
A	mm
C	mm
B	cos he he's he's got history of erm
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	make an easy
B	yes
B	lead lead coffins I mean
C	is it written down?
A	well no they used to didn't they?
B	they reckon they were Vikings but I don't know
A	mm
B	yeah
A	or you know six foot eight they'd call it seven foot wouldn't they?
B	they would wouldn't they yeah? well you shrink over your age don't you?
C	mm
A	but erm you know the Romans used lead coffins as well didn't they?
B	yeah
A	I mean for the rich ones
B	yeah
A	the poor ones just got a sack I expect
B	and they just got a sack yeah
B	yeah is that where that saying come you just got the sack?
A	no don't think
C	no don't think so
B	no the the lord of the manor had you done in you see
B	stick you in a sack
C	mm
A	well perhaps it's just maybe
C	do you get a payment? sack of money?
A	to take your goods away or your
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	belongings away
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
B	or maybe a bit of grain
B	in the sack
A	mm
B	yeah there's some yeah
C	mm
B	but I mean this history thing I
A	mm
B	when I was younger
A	oh yeah
B	but she was she was good
A	mm
C	well there's a lot of history in RI isn't there?
B	well I suppose there is a lot of history in RI
C	mainly the fighting
A	Old Testament ain't you?
B	yeah yeah
A	all the raping pillaging and killing going on
C	yeah
B	she was a lovely teacher
C	there's always been trouble over there
A	you what?
C	well there's always been trouble hasn't there? Israel and Palestine?
A	oh yeah
C	so
B	well it'll go on forever won't it? it's like it's like two American families that have a have a feud they never get over the feud
A	mm
B	do they? it'll go on and on and on forever just
A	yeah well I I'm reading this book at the moment which
B	oh right
A	cos he had just conquered the whole known world
B	Alexander the Great yeah
C	mm
A	and er you know he had sort of vast wealth which he'd got together and he had all these generals who were totally er under his control and
B	yeah
A	who had strong allegiances with him
B	yeah
A	everyone wanted to take over and
A	and some of them only wanted to take over a bit and some of em wanted to take over another bit and
B	oh right
A	nobody knew who was gonna take control of you know Greece
B	well yeah
A	at that time
B	yeah
A	and er it's so typical of what's going on now cos like
B	it is ain't it?
C	mm
A	they all sort of had these sort of plans of their own
B	yeah
A	ideas to get them into power
B	yeah
A	but they'd form all these coalitions with various other generals and then attack them to sort of get rid of the opposition
A	and then as soon as they did that like the people under his control split off and then they'd they'd go and make er alliances with these generals that had been defeated
A	erm to attack him
B	oh I see
A	and then he then he'd be killed then someone else'd be top dog
B	yeah
A	and then invariably one of them'd die or one of the others'd get an even bigger army and
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and it all worked er depended on who got the control of all the money
B	yeah
A	cos all the
B	they were weren't they? they still are aren't they?
A	and like then you get these sort of
A	so these two
C	oh
A	gonna get rid of him they suddenly look round and half the army's gone
A	and joined the other half
C	mm
A	half the army that er a signal from the other half would suddenly leave him and join the other half and start attacking
B	attack the oh I see yeah
C	mm
A	know what I mean?
B	crikey
A	and er
B	oh dear
C	mm
B	er
A	I'm halfway through this book and already it's sort of like ten years on and like gah you know
C	mm
A	half the people've been killed
B	yeah
A	or half of the senior people have been killed and you know then they got the sons and
C	yeah
A	what have you coming up
B	yeah
A	they're taking revenge and
B	that's it yeah
A	oh dear oh dear and you think you know how can you know in the Middle East today
C	mm
A	you got everyone
B	that's right
A	making allegiances with each other and then
B	yeah
A	at the last minute
B	yeah
A	swapping
B	swap
A	sides and
B	yeah
A	well it's all it's all
B	well ain't that what we do?
A	it's all to do with power isn't it?
B	course it is
A	yeah
B	power power power I mean
A	power and money
B	I saw a little bit about the Ottoman Empire last night
A	it was yeah yeah yeah
B	the absolute well er they
A	well they come and
A	they come into Europe as far as sort of Bulgaria and
B	yeah
A	places didn't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	and start moving armies across don't you?
A	yeah someone who can take control
B	and er
A	and people sort of like suddenly
B	we better follow him
A	we better follow him
B	yeah
A	it's funny ain't it? human nature ain't it?
B	yeah
A	you know like they'll follow someone and follow er yeah and like it's like
C	mm
A	the working man he'll suddenly jump up and pick up a gun and go and follow someone er well that person don't care whether he's here or not really
B	no course he don't
A	and when er this working man get killed for a cause
B	yeah
A	he just gets buried in a grave along with a load of other people and you think well he's not gained anything from it
C	yeah
A	you know it's not some anyone who
C	mm
A	it was like in the First World War you know all these people
B	millions of em
A	millions of em fighting
C	mm
A	and just like slaughtering each other
B	slaughter yeah yeah
A	you know I mean like the Germans and the
C	yeah
A	Austrians and the you know the er British and the French and
B	that's right
A	everyone in between
B	yeah
A	and it's sorta like last man standing weren't it?
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	and you think well
B	why?
C	mm
A	who's got anything out of this?
B	yeah
A	apart from the people making the bullets
B	well that's right yeah yeah
A	well Second World War yeah er they've achieved everything they set out to achieve in er
B	they have now yeah
A	you know
B	I mean they're fantastic
A	well that's right
B	cos they're
A	but I mean they're you see this is what I reckon that that in the last hundred years the British people have been let down by successive governments
B	yeah
A	who've had
B	yeah
A	to be become this
C	mm
A	industrial powerhouse
B	yeah
A	and when you go to Germany now
C	mm
A	everyone's so much better off than here
B	yeah I should imagine they are
C	yeah
A	you know I mean there's a jay in the tree there
B	really?
C	yeah
A	a little jay
C	a jay
B	which one? the back
A	in the
B	oh there it go that was a jay yeah
A	you know the old erm
B	yeah
A	willow
B	willow yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah no you you know when you think that each person what they can start off with and by personal graft what they can build up to
B	yeah
A	right? then you think well if they start off with nothing they can build up to quite a lot
C	mm
A	build up to even more
B	that's right
A	but not in this country you can't
B	no no I er er you're
C	mm
A	you
B	that's taken away from you
A	you start with nothing you build up to quite a lot then it
B	taken away
C	yeah
A	the kids more or less start again
B	yeah
A	mm
B	except for the well the gentry the gentry that
A	well this is right and
B	they they got on better than we have
A	but they they
B	they do they write the rules
A	I mean like this rule that
C	mm
A	on agricultural land there's no death duties
B	that's right yeah
A	you know so you can own you know
B	thousands of acres
A	five thousand
C	yeah
A	acre estate
B	yeah
A	and like you know which is worth hundreds of millions and
B	yeah
A	you never have to pay death duties on em just hand it down to your children
B	no
A	and like all these trust funds
C	mm
A	that rich people can set up
B	yeah
A	for the kids so that they never pay death duties
B	no
A	I mean what's all that about?
C	mm
B	oh I don't know
A	not that I'm advocating death duties as a good thing but er what I don't like
A	seeing is how some people get out of it and others have to pay it
B	yeah
A	it's what Cameron just coming on about he'd promise the earth
B	vote for me and I'll give you everything in the world
C	yeah
A	yeah we'll send you
C	mm
A	five hundred pound a week in notes through the post
B	yeah
A	every person in the land
A	well it's like UKIP ain't it?
B	oh yeah it's like
A	god they stand up they're promising everything
A	it's alright as long as you don't have to do it
B	everyone's going to be very rich
A	yeah it is
B	oh can't believe it
A	my brother-in-law's that way inclined
B	yeah?
A	he's sort of going on and like yeah I mean I don't know
A	I'm thinking blooming heck you know yeah but I know people who live in
A	you know and there's oh yeah and the whole neighbourhood
C	mm
A	what would you do if a immigrant family come and live next door? and
B	oh that's terrible
A	and all this sort of thing
B	terrible
A	and I'm sort of thinking this guy you know is you know always you know a bit sort of
B	yeah yeah
A	but

C	erm
A	yeah there's all this noise ain't there?
C	yeah
A	damn clock
B	tick tock yeah
A	er counting counting your life away
B	yeah
B	what we haven't heard lately is
A	no they're
B	they're all gone to Cyprus ain't they?
A	it's quite funny isn't it cos like before
B	before it all kicked off they came
A	they were roaring away and that was when there was some
B	yeah
A	and this guy young young lad didn't know nothing
A	he oh ah oh
B	yeah
A	oh no there's nothing about that in the paper so I said yeah well you you look in a week's time
A	cos they did exactly the same before didn't they?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	jets roaring about all over the place
B	crikey er
A	yeah
B	and it's silent now ain't it?
A	that's right yeah just as well
C	mm
B	cor don't they make a row? they do their dog fights
A	yeah
B	fights up there don't they? er all the way round
A	mm
B	and then they then they they go from church to church apparently
A	oh yeah?
B	so they can actually fly fly below the radar
A	mm
B	and they come along wow they come past there don't they?
C	yeah sometimes
A	yeah
B	and they go they go to the church and then they veer of
A	mm
B	and they go to another church
A	well it's the one where they come
C	yeah
A	low and then they do a steep climb
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	putting the afterburners on
B	cor
A	and like the whole
C	mm
B	yeah
A	isn't it?
B	yeah
A	you know from the shock waves from this
B	and yet if you have your radio on like too loud you can get done for it
C	mm
B	now er who was that? somebody said they were reporting them who they were reporting the
A	yeah
B	and the RAF or the government to be that was said get the numbers of the planes and then we can go
A	yeah
B	yeah and then we can
A	mm
B	then we can do something about it they said
C	they did didn't they?
A	but in Wales apparently they sort of do this low flying in the valleys and that
B	mm
A	and then they use like farmers on tractors as sort of as er practice you know
B	yeah
A	dropping bombs
B	yeah
A	on em you know
A	so you could be driving your tractor and suddenly whoosh you know
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and you think oh that bloke was just
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	gonna drop a bomb on you
B	yeah
C	mm
B	well they probably they they'll probably go up as a guided thing and they they that does that guide er guide the bomb down don't it?
A	all the way all the way yeah
B	so if they switch it on they go
A	mm
B	er a sort of dummy hit if you know
A	yeah well I suppose they must do it like they pick a target
B	yeah
A	that goes to the bomb guidance so they can drop the bomb shoot off and the bomb just goes on its own doesn't it?
B	that's right yeah
A	hits er the spot what they picked out
B	mm
C	mm
B	and don't they? I don't know whether you've seen in the news lately I watched
C	it was that programme last night
B	no it
C	yeah
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	and they got this great big camp I mean it must be massive
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	huh?
A	yeah I can't believe that I've seen pictures photo pictures of it yeah
B	yeah
A	well it just shows you how actually
C	mm
A	how little effect one bomb has anyway doesn't it?
B	well it does yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	boom you know
C	mm
B	that make you sick don't it?
C	mm
A	well it's
B	well yeah someone's making money
A	cos like the RAF you know they gotta use these Tornados up haven't they? cos
B	yeah they have haven't they?
A	they're gonna get rid of em soon
B	yeah
A	gonna get them blooming Yank
B	yeah
A	what are they? F thirty-fives?
B	yeah
A	which have proved to be like the the dog-end of the
B	yeah that's right
A	aircraft production
B	yeah
A	and nobody wants em
B	well
A	yeah yeah yeah that's true
B	and that's true
A	that's right yeah
B	I dunno why they're all they're all so frightened of the Americans I mean
A	well because
B	we don't want them over here do we?
A	er America controls something like I forget what the figure is but it's a
B	yeah
A	er percentage of the world's economy
B	well I suppose they do
A	they're something like
B	they're trillions in debt
A	they're something like sixty percent of the world economy
B	yeah
A	that figure might be totally outrageous but it's it's something mind-blowing
B	yeah
A	as er considering how big they are
B	but why have they got so much debt?
B	and how how do they how?
A	that's how they sell stuff don't they?
B	how have they going to pay it back?
A	they lend people er
B	well I suppose it is really yeah
A	as long as you can pay em back the interest
B	yeah
A	who cares how big your mortgage is
B	not gonna matter now
A	no
B	oh yeah I know the ones you mean
A	but
A	they
B	they are pretty big ain't they? yeah
A	but they reckon they've got overseas assets of billions of pounds
B	yeah
A	cos they have to keep it er hold it overseas cos if they brought it back to America they'd have to pay tax on it
B	yeah
A	and so they got you know like each of these companies has got you know you know several billion quid sitting overseas in er
B	in Luxembourg somewhere yeah
A	well or invested I think most of it is invested in overseas
B	but I mean like most of these companies have er these big companies have er either got their headquarters in
A	mm
B	or in Luxembourg or in Belgium
A	there was a bit today about how Apple are being investigated for their headquarters in Ireland
B	have they?
A	mm
C	mm
B	oh yeah well Sony ought to be investigated about it too
A	yeah
B	they're in Ireland as well aren't they?
A	yeah but you look at Ebay and
B	yeah
A	people like this and
B	none of them even pay tax do they?
A	Amazon Amazon and companies like that none of em pay tax
B	no
C	mm
A	but I suppose they work on the principle that all their employees
B	get yeah
A	are paying PAYE aren't they?
B	yeah course they are
A	mm
B	there there's that er Chinese bloke now
A	oh the chap running Alibaba
B	Alibaba
C	oh right yeah
B	that's the one yeah
C	that's it
A	you ever been on that site?
B	I haven't er
C	no
B	no I haven't
A	I've
B	yeah
A	coming up to Christmas and you were gonna do this by having hydrogen-filled balloons with a printed logo on it right?
B	yeah
A	and you wanted someone to make them
C	mm
A	if you go onto Alibaba there's thousands of firms who make them for like fifty P a hundred and stuff like that all printed off
B	wow
A	and send it to you
C	mm
A	it's it's just full of companies who'll make anything
B	yeah?
A	cardboard boxes and all
B	oh wow
A	anything
C	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	the fact that there's all these firms in China and Hong Kong
C	yeah
A	who are willing to do business with anybody in the world
B	well of course they are
A	at dirt price
B	yeah
A	you know dirt you know at really low prices
C	mm
A	and er the other bit is they sort of serve as Amazon and Ebay for Chinese people as well
B	oh
A	it's
C	oh
A	China this company alright it all belongs to one bloke
B	yeah oh er right yeah
A	who's really
B	yeah?
A	because before you had all these villages where people are living hand to mouth
B	yeah
A	you know like every family's got like three acres and they spend all the year growing food just to eat and nothing left over
B	yeah
A	and they're saying all their children are then seeing no future in it and then leaving to
B	that's right yeah
A	but because of Alibaba these people can now get into the sort of the rural economy making stuff
B	oh I see yeah
A	and can
B	oh right
A	whereas before
B	they
A	they'd then have to take it to a market which is only a limited market anyway
B	that's right yeah
A	which'd soon become flooded with er
C	mm
A	whatever they were doing
B	yeah
A	and also they'd have to take time out go in there be in there all day coming home and going all this sort of stuff
A	you know
B	yeah
A	cos they're
B	yeah
A	saying that you know there's loads of people loads of these villages have sort of set up
C	mm
A	microindustries making stuff
B	well
A	and
B	yeah
A	they were saying that it's so good that they can make money and like the kids are coming back into the villages cos they've you know got places to live
B	yeah
A	and er rather than
B	that sounds really good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and you think you know what they need is to set up something like that in Africa don't they?
B	they do don't they? yeah or in
A	huh?
A	yeah but I mean you know these towns like Soweto where there's
C	yeah
B	yeah where there's
A	no one's working and
B	no
A	it's just like or in
B	well they're just
A	South America you know?
B	they're just starving aren't they? they're just starving
A	well they just drink
C	yeah
A	themselves to death
B	no
A	no industry or nothing
B	no
A	yeah they could set up these little
C	mm
A	microindustries
B	yeah
A	and of course once you know these sort of villages get a bit more prosperous
B	that's right
A	you know products to build better houses or what have you or
B	yeah
A	or stuff to do er
B	wear better clothes or whatever yeah
A	building wells or
C	mm
B	yeah
A	anything
C	yeah
A	you know it's
B	we're been visiting flies now
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you left em open when you came in there
B	yeah
B	they'll all snuff it they only got two days to live ain't they?
A	what?
C	yeah
B	flies
A	bluebottles? they live more than two days
B	these flies these ones here
A	oh them little things
B	yeah
C	mm
B	I dunno how long bluebottles live
A	apparently they live quite a long while don't they? if you've got one shut up erm
B	yeah
A	up in the room that's it
B	yeah
B	what we had we had we've just had a er sort of erm a wasp fest
A	wasps?
C	yeah
B	wasps
A	I don't think I've only seen one wasp this
B	well we
C	these are teeny little wasps
B	they're little English wasps
A	are they wasps?
C	really small
B	yeah they're wasps
A	rather than flies what look like wasps?
B	they're not
C	no no they are wasps
B	they lay dead all over the place in our
A	really?
B	yeah
A	they're quite often down the loo
B	they're quite often like
A	where have they come from then?
B	so I reckon they come out of that Ductex
C	they only come er
A	yeah must do
C	but you blocked it up
B	I've blocked it up now yeah
C	but we'll still have some somewhere
B	but they're still coming down yeah
A	yeah
C	lots of them
B	and some of them are just sort of crawling about
B	I got stung damn it
A	did you?
B	er
B	that's not nice you know
A	they do sting wasps don't they?
B	they do
A	it's like someone sticking a red hot needle in you
B	yeah that is
A	mm
B	and then after after the pain has gone a couple of days later that just itch and itch and itch
A	that was your excuse
C	mm
B	no I wondered what on earth it was and I just went like that and that
A	lucky it weren't a cobra
B	no that weren't very nice I tell you
C	yeah they've been funny ain't they?
B	yeah
C	oh you know
C	yes that's what I thought I'd er
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	getting a bit
A	cos I had to go to
A	you know you get sort of like
B	you do don't you?
A	needing to pee you got limited you know when you're in the car you got limited
B	yeah
A	places
C	I was about to ask you er
A	how's your shed coming on then?
B	you'll
B	not yet
A	have you got your bed in there yet?
C	no
B	that look goes oh I might get one
C	that was my brother's idea
A	put some what?
C	hire
A	blimey you could of in er
C	that that was when it was empty
A	in
C	we got
B	yeah
A	you could you'd get two hundred pound a week for that
B	you would wouldn't you? mm
C	but we got all the shelving up now
B	everything is labelled
A	yeah but did you put a sink in there?
B	no there's no sink
A	cos that'd be luxury wouldn't it?
C	got a towel
B	I've got a towel yeah
A	that'd be luxury wouldn't it?
B	that would wouldn't it? yeah
A	having a shed with running water and a sink
B	that would wouldn't it? oh that'd be good
C	I've got a sink in my dairy
A	huh?
C	I've got sink in the studio
A	yeah
B	you've got a sink in the studio yeah
A	yeah well what you need then is er
C	that is useful
A	a double a double erm what do you call it? not a double
B	double bowl?
A	double bowl
B	yeah
A	yeah but they're not called that are they?
B	no they're not
A	a sink with two holes
B	that's it yeah
A	what are they called?
C	right
A	double
C	what? his and hers
A	double sink
B	double sink yeah probably
B	oh yeah
A	right?
A	and one you could wash your hands in
B	what about drainage issues?
A	well er one'd be just going down into a plastic tub cos you wouldn't use that much petrol would you?
B	no you wouldn't would you no
A	you know just a five gallon barrel underneath there
B	yeah
A	which you could er put all your your rubbish
A	use to light the bonfire
B	yeah
A	I have got some
C	what's that for?
B	mm?
A	doing the wood
B	yeah
A	mix it with paraffin
C	oh
B	that's it yeah
A	or diesel
B	yeah
A	but paraffin will evaporate a bit better
B	that does yeah
A	so it dries up
B	yeah
A	but that was the best thing I found for
B	cor ain't it?
B	little er bowl that I put rusty
A	yeah
A	but some oil and and diesel
B	yeah
A	works wonders
B	oh I see the diesel yeah
A	cos there was once when we had er on site there was a dumper truck
B	yeah?
A	I don't know how it did that
A	broken pistons or something
B	yeah
A	so they kept turned it over and it was just injecting er
B	yeah
A	diesel into it
B	yeah
A	and er I got a bottle of it and I
B	yeah
A	I was just using that as sort of penetrating fluid
B	yeah
A	and it worked wonders
B	yeah
A	cos when you think about it like the the diesel would penetrate wouldn't it?
B	yeah
A	and the oil would lubricate
B	lubricate
A	and the carbon would also
B	that's it
A	as black as the ace of spades you know full of
B	righto
A	full of carbon molecules
B	yeah
A	so you know it's hardly surprising that worked well
B	that isn't
A	oh yeah erm
B	that's it yeah oh piss off
A	government funded boiler for
B	yeah they are
A	you know you get a pause
B	yeah
A	mm I expect they were all sort of slitting their throats or something and
B	yeah
A	hung themselves
A	well that's right but
B	who was that?
C	PPI
B	PPI
A	PPI
C	the bank thing
A	cos they got a new
C	Natwest mm Barclays and something or other
A	oh that's the one ain't it?
C	yeah that one
A	Natwest Barclays
A	HSBC
A	erm er Lloyds
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	stupid lot
A	probably two years
B	two two years
A	has he got it going?
B	yeah
C	yeah he's got his er all his accounts on it
B	he's got all his accounts on that now
A	well I tell you what
B	yeah
A	they work like rockets
B	they do yeah
A	they really work well
B	yeah
A	and if he's just put his accounts on it
C	well that's what he said anyway
A	it's perfect you know?
B	that's perfect for his accounts yeah that's what he was doing
C	not not on the internet
B	he's got nothing else on
A	no
C	yeah
B	he just put his accounts on
A	well you know what's er yeah as soon as you go on the internet you put anti-virus on I mean that slows down
B	yeah
A	you know my computer when it loads up
B	yeah
A	and when that loads up that's got something like er er nine
B	yeah
A	and like I've only got er one gigabyte
B	yeah of RAM yeah
A	of memory
B	you do yeah yeah
A	mm
A	I dunno is yours thirty-two or sixty-four?
B	no it's a thirty-two
A	mm
B	mm
A	cos most new ones are sixty-four aren't they?
B	yeah they're all sixty-four but
A	that just means they work twice as quick don't they?
B	yeah
A	but on the other hand you can't load any more programs into it
B	no you can't no
A	which one? the old one?
B	the one I
B	you got on yours and er
A	I've got a copy of it
B	have you?
A	yeah
B	oh brilliant
A	do you want it?
B	yeah
A	put on an old computer?
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	that'd be brilliant thank you
A	well it's er
B	well er
A	it's got everything well I dunno don't suppose it has
B	I got me XP you see and
A	yeah
B	and I want it on there as well
B	just in case this other one go fucked
C	okay
A	oh
B	cos I mean that's only I know it's a German machine
A	thank you
B	that I got from Aldi donkey's yonks ago
A	mm
B	and that work ever so well
B	but of course that's
A	but you've got a lot loaded onto it now ain't you?
B	yes chomping away there er I
A	mm
B	I've been getting rid of lots of stuff on it cos I'm cleaning it up
A	yeah
B	but you ain't got a
B	no
A	oh biscuits
C	digestives and ginger
A	quelle surprise
A	oh you still chomping your way through Mcvitie's digestives then?
C	no
B	no do you know I don't eat er
C	ages ago
B	I don't eat em any more
C	we we er we used them all up ages ago
A	mm
C	you mean when I bought loads?
B	oh they're gone
A	mm
C	a long time ago
A	well these have got a hundred and seventy calories per biscuit haven't they?
B	yeah
A	oh no they ain't
B	that ain't too bad
C	mm
A	I'm sure these ones I bought from
C	mm
A	special cheaper ones I'm sure they were a lot more than that
B	they got more sugar in that's why
C	mm
A	mm
B	you can't beat Mcvitie's
A	but when you got your computer new
B	mm
A	did you go through that
B	no
B	no I didn't
A	I see
B	that is ain't it? but this has got a recovery disk on the on the er on the
A	oh I see
B	yeah I think it has yeah mm
A	cos RAID system you have two disks
B	mm
A	and it automatically copies everything onto the
B	oh does it? yeah
A	so that if the first disk which you use
B	go for it
B	mm
A	corrupts you can then use the second disk as a recovery
B	this one has er got disk C and disk D
A	oh yeah?
B	but on the recovery disk it's only got er
A	mm
B	you can put er one terabyte on it
A	yeah is that partitioned then? no
B	no
A	dunno
A	I think it probably automatically does that
B	mm
A	to recover
B	yeah
A	the trouble is with the recovery disk is
B	updating it yeah yeah
A	with
B	yeah
A	and then about six years later she gave it back cos it wouldn't load up
B	oh right
A	and it worked so slowly
B	yeah
A	and er I sort of tried cleaning it up I got rid of all her stuff and et cetera et cetera and all these sort of clean-up things you can do
B	yeah
A	and er it was still really sluggish
C	yeah
A	looked in the the draw where I keep all the old gubbins and stuff
B	yeah
A	and found this recovery disk
B	yeah
A	erm from new
B	was it?
A	it really was
C	mm
B	oh wow
A	which just goes to prove there's loads and loads of stuff in the registry
C	mm
A	which you don't need which you can't
A	which you it's slowing it down
B	yeah yeah
A	horrendously
C	mm
A	but
B	no matter whether you use that registry clean-up or what
A	mm
B	you know er that that don't clean it right up do it?
A	no
B	that's no
C	mm
B	no I've er I've registry cleaned up and I've
A	mm
B	this that and the other
A	no it doesn't work does it?
B	and and when you look into the roaming bit
A	mm
B	you've got er
A	mm
B	and that's the bit that is using up all the all the memory
A	yeah
B	there's loads on it
A	cos like in your in in the er in your registry everything you do gets a little thing put in there
B	yeah
A	so it sort of checks it out before it does anything else
B	that's right yeah
A	even if you don't need it any more
C	mm
A	they'll still check it out and check it out check it out check out check it out check it out
B	yeah
A	and er
B	it must do all the time mustn't it? plus with all the
C	oh ten
B	ten updates from
A	mm
B	Microsoft
C	yeah

B	what is that?
B	I've got no idea what that is

B	to play
A	and like you know
C	mm
A	when you download Realplayer
B	yeah
A	like all this other gubbins what go with it is constantly
C	mm
A	constantly being updated and
B	and then there's Itunes
A	that's right and er when you download Realplayer you get Itunes as well
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and that's probably sort of sending stuff into the computer
B	that's it
B	yeah
C	yeah we don't actually play er any of it do we?
B	we never play it
A	yeah I got loads cos every time I
C	mm
A	get an old computer from like from

A	ready to be turned into kindling
C	really
C	for a few weeks
C	you can sort us out
A	tell you what you need to keep or not
B	no that'd be awful that would
A	it'll wind up in my garden
B	yeah
A	then I'll have to find somewhere new
B	yeah
C	mm
B	then we can come up and do your you we can come up to you and
A	mm
B	clean your garden up
A	mm
C	what? and bring it back here?
B	cos I don't want to chuck it away
C	mm
B	we're not that bad a hoarders but we are
C	oh we are
B	we are
A	mm
B	we're not that bad not like you see some people on television
C	oh no
A	yeah
A	at least you can get in the house

C	they can't move can they? that's true
A	at least you don't go out with er a
B	no
C	oh
A	picking up empty cans
B	and carrier bags
C	they've got real problems haven't they?
A	mm
C	yeah we've just got a little one
A	but there again
B	well course it is yeah
A	I mean they're happy as
B	yeah
C	no they're not really are they? I wouldn't say
A	aren't they? oh don't you reckon?
C	no they're not because they they do scramble through all this junk and rubbish
A	oh I see right
B	yeah but
C	and they
B	bloke had to have his cooker in the middle of of his kitchen
A	uhu
B	and that
A	mm
B	and he
C	but it's not neat is it?
B	lit the gas
A	mm
C	yeah
B	in there
A	mm
C	but you see there's there's nowhere to put the tin so that gets chucked
A	oh
C	nearest place
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and he
A	yeah
C	and the
A	yeah I imagine that
C	cartons get chucked
A	I the one I saw was the
C	cos they he can't leave that
A	that one about that old Polish wartime pilot
A	I think he's dead now but
A	this was some years back and he was sort of one of them people who had just like their whole garden was full of rubbish
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know it was like eight foot high
B	oh yeah
C	yeah
A	in
B	we did see that
C	in that's right yeah
A	and then when the council they cleaned it up
C	mm yeah that's right
A	and was like filmed it all and
A	but
B	yeah
A	I mean why should they sort of like be presenting that to the whole world?
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	yeah
A	you know they should have screens up there go in with a digger and a lorry clean it up
B	clean it up yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh look he's chucked
B	yeah
A	I mean it's
B	I know
A	inhumane
C	mm
B	yeah well
C	yeah
B	humans aren't treated nice
A	mm
C	some some of these people actually ask for help don't they?
C	they need help
B	oh yeah
A	managed to collect a million pounds
B	yes they got a million pound for that
A	in a week
B	the dog show
C	mm
B	the the er the dog er kennels that got burnt down
C	oh yeah did they?
B	and er
A	well it was a dog's
B	yeah
C	they got a million pound from people?
A	and
C	oh
A	cos they felt sorry for
B	yeah
A	cos there was something like erm dunno what was it? thirty odd dogs died in the fire
B	that's right yeah
C	mm
A	and they rescued about another ninety or whatever
B	yeah that's right
C	yeah
A	and some kid had set fire to it
C	mm
B	yeah a fourteen-year-old kid
A	but they got a million quid
B	yeah
A	in about a week or something like people donating
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's like that place down there ain't it?
A	well the thing about it is is that all these
C	mm
A	rescue centres they don't keep the dogs forever do they?
B	no
C	no
A	like Battersea Dogs Home
C	mm
A	they're only in there for like
B	they are and then they're put down
A	you know six months or something
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	like that one down there they it used to be er what they called a knackers yard and and everything used to go for glue and stuff like that
C	mm
B	they don't go that far don't know if they do that any more do they?
A	dunno but if you have a dog er if you have an animal
B	yeah to get rid of the carcass yeah
A	so there must be incinerator-type places
B	there are
C	mm
B	when we're on the way to
C	on the way to London
B	er?
C	on the way to London
B	yeah it's on
B	no
B	no there's a there's a animal incinerator along the A505
A	oh is there? oh right
C	mm
B	and that's a huge place that's just
A	well you need somewhere pretty big to put a horse in don't you?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but there's all these regulations about what you can't do and you can't you can do and you can't
B	well you're not supposed to bury em on your land any more
A	no that's right
B	you can yeah
A	I dunno
B	I dunno
A	well you could leave the horse on top of the land for a few months
B	yeah
A	got a bit smaller
B	yeah you could couldn't you yeah
A	cos then that wouldn't pollute the
C	in Wales we came across loads of
B	oh the you know when
C	ponies
A	dead sheep or ponies?
B	dead
C	and and and a horse and foal
B	yeah
C	it's so sad
B	it was awful you
A	when was this?
B	they had a really bad winter didn't they?
C	they would've been eaten as well you know
A	was this early on in the year then?
B	this was earlier this year weren't it? was it this year?
C	yeah
B	yeah it was this year
C	it was er
B	and they had a bad winter
A	yeah
B	and they were all all wild stuff
C	they were wild yeah
B	and I mean well I mean there were sheep
C	mm
A	well the sheep weren't wild were they?
B	no that's what I mean and I
A	the ponies could've been
B	the ponies could've been er
C	yeah
B	I mean there was there was mare and foal laid together
C	yeah
A	mm
B	dead
C	so sad
B	and you know you you'd be walking across the the moors and the mountains and the fields and what have you
C	mm
A	mm
B	all these carcasses that just lay there
C	well
A	well were they how
B	there was lots
C	yes well
A	what like twenty or thirty or?
B	well you
B	we we could've we could've gone round looking for em
A	yeah
B	but on the footpaths where we walked
C	mm
B	there were six or seven different carcasses
A	oh right yeah
C	mm yeah yeah
B	but and these were just on the footpaths
A	yeah that's quite a lot
C	mm
A	cos I I can remember going to the Lake District er with the uni
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	usually in the river
B	yeah
A	just round the corner from where you'd stooped to have a drink
B	yeah
C	right yeah
B	you did that didn't you?
C	that's what I did yes
B	she was ill
C	we were ill
A	oh yeah
C	the very first time we didn't have those Campden tablets in our water
B	mm
C	we thought oh it's a lovely pretty beautiful stream coming down
A	spring water must be totally pure
C	just where we were camping
B	yeah
C	looks so lovely
A	mm
C	further up and followed the river up
C	that was in Wales too
A	mm
B	there was one time when you could drink out the river
B	well that's true when we were kids
A	mm
B	we did that you know?
A	well I was listening to this sort of historical villages programme
B	yeah
A	where the er the brook goes under the road?
B	that's right yeah
A	and then them houses?
B	yeah
A	along there? there was this someone
B	at
A	could be
B	yeah
A	yeah it could be
B	that is
A	and er the houses on there and there was people talking about their grandparents who lived in these houses and they used to get all their drinking water out of the river
B	yeah
A	they used to just go
C	yeah
A	down there and stick the bucket in and that'd be the
C	yeah
A	you know getting all the water
B	yeah
B	no no
A	and er obviously
C	mm
A	no wells or anything down there
B	that's right
C	so I suppose they just boiled it didn't they? must've boiled it up?
A	well it's amazing they must've done yeah
C	for drinking mm
B	well
A	don't suppose you'd've drunk it
C	that would've been alright wouldn't it?
B	that's right yeah
A	no er I actually probably what they did is put it in a jar for
C	yeah
B	oh right yeah
A	and let it settle
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and then they might've drunk it
B	then they'd pour it out
A	but in those days you could you could buy these jars
C	yeah
A	with a
B	yeah
A	with a charcoal filter in the bottom
B	oh I see yeah
C	mm
A	where you'd have a layer of sand sharp sand a layer of charcoal and then another layer of sharp sand
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and that'd have a tap at the bottom
C	oh I see yeah
A	and that would act as filtration
B	and that bit would filter it
C	filter it
B	yeah
A	er the charcoal would kill anything
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and the sand'd filter out all the bits
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	when my mum had had er the house in what was it called? my mum's house
C	yeah
B	what was it called?
B	well she called it
B	that was er that was up
A	mm
B	you used to have to go through the woods over the hill and down and there was my mum's house built the
A	oh right
B	right? and then they built my mum's house or or
A	mm
B	right? and for the servants' quarters they had a pipe goes right down to the river
A	mm
B	and a pump that pumped it up into the woods where this big old reservoir was in the woods
A	mm
B	and then that'd come down and that's what they the servants used to drink
A	mm
B	yeah probably yeah
C	mm
A	thing there as well
B	yeah yeah
A	but probably not a very good one
B	the tank was er as was
A	uhu
B	and about eight eight foot deep
A	mm but probably the worst thing about it was that all the pipes were probably lead anyway
B	yeah probably
C	mm er
A	so
C	didn't your mum have a
B	oh yeah they had a well that that
C	oh that was different
A	mm
B	that that was different that was that was dug ages
C	mm
B	the servants' quarters were built
C	oh I see
A	mm
C	okay
B	that weren't nothing to do with the servants' quarters that was to do with the house
C	mm
B	and er
C	they tested that didn't they? and it they said it was unfit for
B	they tested it and said they got
A	really?
B	this was
C	and they'd been they'd been drinking it all their lives
B	it was in the middle of nowhere
A	yeah
B	and it was
A	why was it unfit?
B	very very very deep
A	uhu
B	but I believe there was some kind of copper filtration in it
A	oh right
B	cos some of them some of them er had went if the bath dripped you got the blue
A	oh right
B	copper but they had been drinking it forever
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and er a lot of rope and a bucket
B	yeah
A	and er that'd come up and every now and again you'd get little red squiggly worms in it
B	that's it yeah
A	and they said oh that's really good water cos
B	the red squiggly worms are in it
A	cos the red squiggly worms wouldn't live wouldn't live in polluted water
C	oh really? oh right
A	no they tested the copper pipe that came out alright
C	yeah
A	but they had that well there for well they only used it for probably three four years or
B	yeah
A	three years four years
B	well the water board
A	when we got the water you know woah we got the water the water
B	got water on yeah
A	the water's coming
B	yeah the er the er the Anglian Water board said that they were going to start charging for everybody for wells this is ages ago now
A	mm
B	and they couldn't could they?
A	yeah well it's a bit like America
B	yeah
A	America's got this idea that all the water belongs to them
B	yeah
A	the government
B	yeah
C	mm
B	that's wrong ain't it?
A	mm
C	yeah
A	well and it makes you wonder like if if er if you filled a water tub up when it rained would that be illegal?
B	well that's right yeah would it? yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah that's really weird ain't it? I mean
C	mm
B	but I don't see how they can say that that belong to them
A	well
B	that's right yeah
A	I mean there is a certain thing in hydrology which is they're finding in California now and also in the Middle East is that the government has to control the use of water to a certain extent
B	yeah because
A	otherwise you'd just
B	some people wouldn't get it
A	well no I mean Australia as well the thing is everyone no one it's like global warming no one'll pay any attention to it till that's all gone
B	that's right yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and then in in
C	mm
A	places like in California they're having horrendous droughts but they just keep putting deeper and deeper wells in
A	and pumping more and more water out
C	yeah
A	and they're saying well you know this is not sustainable
B	no
C	mm
A	and like the thing is you you know all the the big erm orange growers and that
C	mm
A	they need the water
B	they do
A	and they're just saying well you know it's our you know multimillion pound business what are we gonna do? just
C	mm
A	give up?
B	yeah
A	and they're saying well you know we have to work out some different way you can't keep drilling all of these deeper wells because then the aquifers which supply you know the major towns in California
B	yeah
A	they're just all drying up
B	yeah
A	well there's er you know I mean
C	mm
A	there cos a lot of these aquifer er these reservoirs rely on snow melt
B	yeah
A	cos they got quite high mountains there along the coast
B	yeah they do yeah yeah
C	mm
A	but of course they haven't had the snow in recent years and
B	no that's right
A	and there's pictures of these these massive great lakes which are only about a quarter full
B	yeah
A	incredible
B	wow
A	in
C	mm
A	you know we'd
B	wow
A	these old towns
B	there's a place in in Yorkshire
C	mm
B	very similar to that
A	yeah
B	they they flooded this er village
A	yeah
B	a whole village made it into a
A	mm
B	some of the roofs of the housing and the church are showing through
A	mm
B	they didn't get rid of them why
A	well it's like if you if you drown a reservoir er a valley you got all trees and god knows what in there
B	well you do yeah
A	all them little all them little creatures
B	yeah
A	what live in there
C	mm
B	that's all cleaned anyway the water is ain't it?
B	I was just thinking of the lead on er on the church roof
A	I I think they'd take it off
A	I think if you're gonna drown you know this sort of idea that
C	yeah
A	you know you can still hear the bells ringing in the church
B	yeah
A	I think anything of value was
C	mm
A	taken out of these places before they were
B	yeah
A	abandoned
B	I
A	there's always some fly-by-night who'll be there if that weren't done officially that'd've been done unofficially
B	that would wouldn't it yeah
A	yeah
B	oh you can still hear the bell at
C	mm
B	you could still hear the bell on certain nights you
A	yeah bad storm brewing
B	nah
C	mm
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but we knew
