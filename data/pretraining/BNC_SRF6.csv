B	mm
A	they're not uncomfortable these ones and these ones I'd save for special er special occasions
B	mm
A	out and they're not as comfortable but the others yeah they're really comfy just got that wedge but mm
B	mm
A	orange er what do you call it? deep beige or something

B	it's darker than bamboo
A	yeah about that colour
B	mm
A	and they were beautiful erm
A	buy them all
A	should buy every single colour you can get so yeah
A	you can't no

B	mm
A	so my feet are too wide aren't they? yeah I'm really pleased really pleased
B	good
A	mm
B	just have to be careful wearing those with your ankles at the moment
A	yeah but these have more padding
B	mm
A	than wearing the flat shoes
B	mm
A	and actually they're more comfortable
B	maybe that's why you know? you're just wearing those flat ones they haven't got any give at all
A	no well
B	and maybe that's one of the reasons
A	they're good for walking about
B	why your ankles are fucked eh?
A	yeah I still like these
B	you know look at that I mean that's
A	I still like them
