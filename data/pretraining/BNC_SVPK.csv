A	that would be my point cos it's just a point of principle that I don't really wanna take the job search too far
B	yeah
A	while I'm not on full hours because I just don't think that's
B	oh no of course not no
A	and I know a lot of people would apply
B	and also you kind of don't wanna turn
A	and now I'm fucking off
B	now I'm pissing off yeah
A	or I've used that tack you'd never want it to be the case that they'd turn round and be like oh but you were on sick leave then but were you that sick?
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	if you could search for job and that's not
B	you don't wanna damage your relationship with
A	and also don't want it to be the case where they think oh we moved you from a certain subject to another one and you weren't happy so you've now left and it's kind of like well
B	yeah
A	but I'm just like you know what?
B	but after six eight months I think that's probably fine
A	yeah I mean that's the thing like the hospital treatment is like the first batch of it is pretty much coming to an end erm and then they're going to reassess and see what more
B	yeah
A	cos the problem is that everyone else in the
B	yeah
A	so I haven't had anything
B	mm
A	and what is good and what is bad and what to look out for nobody
B	yeah
A	I've been trying to dictate all of this myself and I could've got it completely wrong in some in fact in some ways I think I have erm which is why I'm struggling with
B	but if you've never
A	no not in a working context
B	mm
A	I'm not I've not ever been that bad that one appointment is enough to set me off but also
B	but also
A	no and it just
B	for you to
A	no I think
B	take this opportunity to be like oh I need this much time off work because I've got chronic fatigue syndrome or like
A	I miss being at work I miss
B	yeah exactly I think you've
A	I miss being at work and I miss being able to
B	you've got that drive
A	and that's what I've missed and that's what I'm starting to get back now
B	yeah
A	is getting that bit of drive so me looking at stuff like you know I've had my inbox
B	mm
A	and stuff that I find interesting
B	yeah
A	and would use in
B	yeah
A	and started to make notes and er and that's me starting to get that drive back and I was like oh I'm gonna go you know and I'm going on a lot of training courses over the next couple of weeks which should be quite good
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	is it marketing but not in a publishing industry? or is it definitely publishing that I wanna be in? but maybe not marketing
B	yeah
A	or is it publishing but just not
B	yeah
A	I don't know whether you can really like
B	mm
A	it's er I'm it's kind of mm kind of done
A	yeah not in any bad way but it's kind of yeah I wouldn't
B	mm
A	but actually
B	yeah
A	I'm able to have a holiday I'm able to see my friends yay
B	and like living with
A	no
B	or having your own space
A	well put it this way
B	like you've got a room but it's not the same
A	happily
B	mm?
A	er
B	oh my god why are there ten people in the house?
A	so so there's
A	no
B	oh
B	okay
A	there was also
B	who's
B	yeah
A	and then
B	she's a forty-year-old he parties like a twenty-year-old
A	yeah she is
B	but
A	I was like anyway I don't do that as a twenty-year-old like
B	do they go in your room? do they stay in your room?
A	no
B	no
A	oh gosh no no and that's one of the things I
B	yeah you rent that you buy you pay for that space and you get that space yeah
A	yeah and if it has
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	you'll know
A	it's gonna be pretty obvious and usually I leave my bag in quite a
B	oh yeah
A	oh I'm
B	I read so many Buzzfeed articles
A	that was pretty much my life reading on the way
B	but I do that as well like erm when
A	yeah
B	but she had like she's had a few house parties over the summer and I was like I'm really sorry but er the one thing I don't want is anybody going in my room
A	mm
B	I don't want them going in my bathroom I don't want them using my room
A	yeah
B	because I just don't trust them and I don't trust them when they're drunk
A	no
B	and it's just drunk people going in your room and going through your personal things and it's just it's not fair
A	yeah it was like er
B	yeah
B	and whose house was this?
A	one of the girls from er you wouldn't know her cos she's just started
B	yeah
A	erm and it was like oh no I mean they managed to get all the stuff out but it is it is that kind of thing I mean you know yeah they have to come into my room if the fuse goes cos erm that's where the fuse box is
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and yeah okay some of them use the shower if they're in a hurry but usually they'll knock on the door or ask if I'm using it or you know whatever so
B	yeah
A	so you know it is that kind of thing but to be honest it's just I don't feel like I've really been there that much I I don't
B	yeah
A	I'm not
B	yeah
A	yeah I remember you saying yeah
B	cos like this week so this week what have I done? erm Monday I was at
A	mm yep
B	Tuesday I went running so and I had my hair cut beforehand so I didn't come home till like half nine
A	mm
B	Wednesday I went I went round
A	mm
B	because she'd been at
A	mm
B	so er yeah I because we're just so busy just seeing each other like even just being in the house for long periods of time is like I spend hardly any time in this house at the moment
A	yeah you're so busy
B	yeah it's manic and I like it I like being busy I like doing stuff but like this weekend it's just nice to have a chilled weekend where you just
A	oh good
B	no no
A	I was
B	oh oh no no no trust me no
B	I have enough social stuff in my calendar to last me a lifetime
B	no I'm very good thank you I am good with a nice chilled
B	chilled evening I'm just gonna put the lights on though cos it's a little bit dark
A	I was gonna say
B	no
A	it does that to me
B	yeah it just creeps up on you doesn't it?
A	and I was like
B	yeah it's really peculiar she she was like it's I I was watching it in the daylight and and now er now er dark
B	yeah
A	I'm not moving
B	just a penalty dunno what accent that was supposed to be
B	who? the South Africans?
A	the South Africans
B	yeah it's gold isn't it?
A	yeah but it's kind of like a pattern so it kind of looks glittery from a distance
B	what are they called? they're called the Springboks aren't they? what does springbok mean? is that a kangaroo or something? or? I dunno
A	I thought it was
B	ah some rugby players are absolutely gorgeous
A	what are they doing now?
B	oh he's having a penalty because he did a spear tackle on him
A	oh okay
B	but it wasn't an intentional spear
A	oh
B	and then onto his back
A	oh
B	he did like a
B	but could you imagine a sixteen stone seventeen stone man doing a
A	oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and he's a very skinny kind of tallish maybe five
A	yeah I've got you yeah
B	and he plays rugby this boy is ten stone and he is playing rugby against fifteen stone boys he's twenty-two
A	he's gonna get thrown up in the air
B	he comes into work every week with broken noses last week he came no not last week
A	oh
B	and I was like
A	not your sport
B	yeah football or basketball although you're not really tall enough for basketball
A	yeah
B	but badminton tennis you know there are lots of sports out there
A	swimming
B	swimming yeah and he's just like he was like
A	why do you do it?
B	he was like well I like rugby I'm good at it I'm like you might be good at it against like ten-year-olds
B	but not against fifteen stone
A	half the size yeah
B	half the size of them and you're just like
A	that blondie he's like a right
B	I know some of
A	but the concussion like issue is quite off-putting
B	oh yeah George North last season got concussed in three matches and wasn't allowed to play
A	yeah
B	it's so dangerous apparently the average professional erm career span for an American footballer is four years because of the amount of
B	the amount of concussion they get do you remember? I know that you you'll appreciate this cos you like Gray's Anatomy as well
B	do you remember that Gray's Anatomy episode where erm Mcdreamy was doing an operation on a NFL player?
B	and the NFL
A	yeah
B	please don't fix me because if I go back on the pitch and I get concussed again I won't even remember my own child
A	yeah
B	and he was like okay
A	but I wanna fix you
B	and then they killed Mcdreamy
A	oh my gosh I know
B	he died he died in a car crash didn't he?
A	I I yeah
B	same as George to be honest that's a bit
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	but Meredith's still in it isn't she?
A	yeah
B	she's been doing it for a very long time now I can remember when it first started
A	yeah it was like eleven ten or eleven years ago now
B	and that first episode where she has that one night stand with Mcdreamy
A	yeah
B	and then kicks him out and then finds out he's her boss and you're like
A	I didn't watch it from the beginning you see
B	ah didn't you?
A	I watched it a couple of episodes afterwards but my mum
B	mm
A	my mum and sister saw it
B	when she goes up to him and she's like I want you and then he's like this is my wife
A	yeah
B	she's like shit
A	I kind of wanna make
B	do you think he'd appreciate it?
A	oh hell no
A	but I'm like this is why I am the way that I am
B	yeah
A	this is why I'm all about the emotional speeches
A	look at that like
B	that is a good emotional speech by Meredith Gray and she's like she's like me she's awful at emotion
A	I was like
B	I don't like feelings
A	but you but you are sentimental babe
B	I am
A	that's the thing with the people that you really care about like the postcards in the box you are really sentimental and er when you
B	yeah
A	you know you're human but you kind of just
B	in the small things
B	yeah
A	to
B	takes a while
A	you er you and
A	does that sense? it's like why did I not recognise that
A	it is quite true
B	yeah
A	I mean I know you you might not really think the best of each other at the moment but it is quite true that like in terms of like your attitude towards people in terms of like when
B	I'm sure we'd get on
A	I think it was just not really the right context or whatever and it was
B	I think I was just
A	oh that's alright
B	yeah
A	I liked just seeing everybody it was so nice like
B	yeah
A	having you there having like the
B	yeah
B	like I'm definitely not somebody who celebrates their birthday though in March and I'm not someone who thinks that the world should revolve around me on my birthday and stuff but
A	mm
B	I just expected a bit more from him that was all
A	I don't know we we we we aired it out
B	good
A	on on the evening er when we well when we got to my house pretty much
B	yeah
A	I am not happy with this and he was like I am not happy either and like we both just kind of
B	yeah
A	ranted for quite a while but
B	mm
A	to think about a certain person in a certain way you know that that's not my job erm but all I expect you to do and all I ask you to do is respect that person
B	mm
A	and appreciate and understand how much that person means to me as a friend and how much
B	yeah
A	they have been there to for me as a friend and it was like you know it was quite easy
A	you know and it was that kind of thing like I
B	mm
A	okay you may not be best friends from day one but
B	mm
A	respect the fact that she looks after me she supports me and I support her and I look after her when she needs it and you know that she's important to me that's what I ask at the moment
B	yeah the thing is like
A	you know and that you know it's fine and whatever happens happens but I I'm just like you know and vice versa it goes for you it's like you respect the fact that he's my boyfriend
B	yeah
A	I'm making my choices and you know
B	that's the thing like
A	and it's the kind of thing that as long as you
B	I would
A	you would say something and I
B	I would tell you yeah like that's why like I never pretend with you like
A	mm
B	I didn't dislike him
B	and I don't like I don't dislike him now I think it was just
A	no
B	but you know
A	yeah
B	you know the first like first impressions
B	no like erm was it when a good reputation is lost it's lost forever
A	lost forever kind of thing
B	and like and I
A	yeah it was just that day no exactly I think that I think
B	it was just hard and I just
A	I think he was er kind of the same but the thing is that both of you reacted in the same way to each other
B	but I don't think I did anything wrong like I don't
A	as in like he
B	mm
A	so I
B	yeah
A	you know but I was kind of like
B	like hate the
A	oh no it was more but he had the kind of thing where he was like well she hasn't talked to me much so
B	yeah
A	I don't you know
A	well I
B	that was my bad I do
A	I'm not gonna say oh yeah I really
A	she probably hasn't seen the best of you either but
B	no no I take responsibility for probably not also saying hello to him
A	oh I know but you know I don't
A	I don't I don't I don't have to tell both of you to act in a certain way with each other
B	no no no
A	that's not my job my job is just to go er look I'm the person that
B	yeah
A	both of you love to pieces and for that reason you will respect each other and hopefully find things to bond over when you actually realise how similar you are as people
B	yeah like I know next time like if I ever meet him it'll be fine
A	oh yeah
B	just as long as he doesn't do something stupid
A	well
B	I'm a very scathing woman
B	really?
A	and told him not as in his friend
B	mm
A	but told
B	mm
A	and er you know cos it was the guy in
B	what a dick
A	it's the lowest er pretty much and he'd said er I'd never met him before
B	yeah
A	and then it was like oh you know I dunno it was just it was just a bit of a weird one to begin with and I kind of just said oh you're a
B	mm
A	like erm
B	no no yeah
A	and I was like oh god right okay well of course er alright to their faces and I'm like you know
B	yeah
A	then I
B	mm
A	thing but him being him yeah okay in that aspect he was a dick and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	in a way so then when I realised that that was him but then I saw him later on and
B	mm
A	is he gonna be alright? are you gonna be alright
B	like he did care
A	yeah and it was when
B	no
A	you know in that instance and I was like think of it like that with
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I know the meant that I know the way that you meant it and I was kind of
B	yeah
A	trying to put you at ease
B	I was trying to be nice
A	but then it kind of didn't put you at ease it just made things worse
B	mm
A	she sees it from that way like
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? so I was just like okay
B	yeah it's just not worth like arguing about like and yeah like I have complete respect for you and I respect your relationship and I trust that you know what you're doing
A	yeah
B	and like I
A	mm
B	and when I was dating him she did not like him
A	mm
B	but so I'm very used to someone telling me that they don't like my boyfriend
A	yeah
B	and I think but with her I was like okay you don't like him that's fine I can understand why you don't like him
A	no you're not
B	and like
B	but like and like I do hope that if I meet
A	yeah I know and I
B	you're gonna have to grow to like her one day cos she's not going anywhere
B	no no no at all
A	you just have to er respect each other
B	yeah
A	and hopefully you will like each other and I
A	I do think that when hopefully you kind of
B	yeah
A	that's that I'm not I'm not gonna be able to get a word in for the rest of the night like that's just how it will be
B	yeah
A	but
B	but I think also like I've grown to appreciate the fact that I'm quite
A	who told you this?
A	well he he's quite boring because he's scared of you
B	well that's what she says she says I think he's intimidated by you because you're not
B	okay what does this mean? she goes well you're very
A	is this
B	yeah I was like where is this going
A	mm
B	and you're very like
A	it's not
B	it's and I'm like
A	it's not that
B	is that a good thing? or? I'm
A	no it is a good thing I see what she means it's more about how
B	mm
A	and er it's more that people do just get that straight
B	yeah
A	that and that is not a bad thing it's just
A	to me or
A	you know and it's not
B	yeah
A	in a certain friendship or relationship whereas you are just kind of
B	yeah
A	that's it this is what I want if you don't like that we're done
B	yeah
A	and that's fine you go for it
B	yeah
A	if er if somebody's intimidated by that
B	it's
A	let them be
B	yeah
A	okay but it never stopped me from being your friend or talking to you
B	that's what's
A	mm
B	but now that I know you it makes me laugh
A	yeah it's more like it's it's more about just getting the chance like
B	yeah
A	with with er with a lot of people it's more about just getting the chance to know them
B	just to get to them yeah
A	like
A	oh okay yeah that
B	not not in a
A	not in a
B	not in a horrible way like he'll do anything for you
B	yeah
A	he likes them he's very nice to like
B	he respects
A	yeah
B	but he doesn't he doesn't think he doesn't really see women as women he sees them as like objects really
A	mm
B	and he isn't really interested in them unless they're there for that reason
A	yeah
B	so I think with me like I'm round their house a lot and I think with me because he can't have that type of relationship with me he's kind of lost for what type of relationship he can have with me
A	to have cos it's like you're not
B	I'm sleeping with yeah so I think he is a bit like I don't know
A	oh
B	this
B	it's just that's just weird
A	er sorry like
