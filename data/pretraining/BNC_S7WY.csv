B	yeah
A	erm
B	right
A	the only person on the table that didn't get full marks everyone else got fourteen out of fourteen and I got thirteen of fourteen
B	what? like times tables as in just erm
A	yeah it was just like a mini test
B	four times five?
A	mm
B	and yeah okay carry on
A	and erm
B	mm mm
A	yes
A	and then but then
A	and then she she erm she did a question and she was like erm right guys I've got three thousand nine hundred and sixty-two as an answer and I just went that's nice
A	but
B	this juice is quite nice actually
A	it is yeah
B	spiced
A	we're drinking like all of it
B	like elderberry juice
A	erm
B	that's good just
A	er I thought I'd mention
A	er a question right
B	yeah
A	finally and
A	and
A	I know she is
B	so competitive and really smug and
A	I don't yeah she's really
B	really annoying
A	I know
B	oh
A	we've also got prefect
B	oh yeah
A	duty on that break
B	oh yeah
A	have you done the questions? some of them? you've not done any of them?
B	I didn't do any
A	mm
B	Easter holiday or whatever it was
A	I really want to try doing an opening speech or
B	oh it was over the Christmas holidays
A	something like that would be cool
B	did oh
A	yeah
B	then and it was fine
A	well at least they don't really care too much about the questions
B	but I can't do the closing speech yet anyway cos I don't know everyone's questions
A	oh yeah
B	so I have to wait till we go through it at least once
A	at least once
B	before I can actually know what points to make and stuff
A	mm
B	cos I'll know what points I can do
A	mm
B	so I'll add them
A	it's a
B	yeah last time only wrote the closing speech like two weeks before we had it
A	yeah
B	is that the person you're questioning?
A	yeah
B	is he the first guy or the second guy?
A	the
B	mm yeah and this one
A	but I'm also questioning the second defence witness which is such a fail because it's like this long
B	mm
A	erm Vic Fisher
B	oh yeah that's
A	not
B	no erm
A	oh no
B	but you're not
A	I'm not questioning her no
B	questioning Vic Fisher
A	erm Vic Fisher's friend
A	Jules Martin
A	erm
B	it's gonna be something really weird
A	mm
B	Vic? what kind of name is that? also for a boy
A	Vic Fisher yeah
A	my name is Vic Fisher
B	are you Vic?
B	or queen
A	I dunno
B	Vic
A	and I just have to ask like really random questions erm it's gonna be hard plus I'm pretty sure we're not gonna do any like rehearsals and
B	yeah
A	on her last one especially
B	we really need to like
A	get rid of her?
B	yeah
B	replace her with someone else
A	you don't want people like that on a team like I'm not trying I'm not trying to be very mean but she sort of people that just wanna do it by themselves like their own way and don't listen to anybody else saying
B	yeah
A	oh look you can't actually ask a leading question she's like no I'm right I'll do it
B	yeah she's like oh they're not leading it's just this
A	I know and then she messed up on the day and blamed it on the Jules Martin guy
B	yeah
A	cos he introduced new evidence
B	but she also
A	yeah exactly no but she messed up because her questions were rubbish and then she shouldn't have got so fazed by the fact that he was making up weirdo questions
B	yeah I know
A	she should have just carried on with her normal questions
B	yeah but instead she like made up random things
A	mm
B	and I was like
A	like Mrs
B	like he said
A	mm
B	and it was like oh a gift shop seem expensive he was like mm they're not normally and she was like oh I don't know oh
B	then she like panicked I think
A	I think erm well Mrs
B	mm
A	but that would have been really boring just doing the magistrate
B	yeah I know
A	but we did we did pretty well considering we didn't even have the booklet
B	mm
A	that I think they might outline
B	like what things there might be for
A	yeah and then I can tick and
B	guilty or not guilty
A	yeah then I can tick and cross them
B	mm
A	to see if people actually say them
B	then next time don't say as many points and leave me after you
B	you like said all the points I was thinking
A	I was panicking
B	I could say you were like
A	I was panicking
B	erm well this and this
B	and this and this oh and this
A	I've actually
B	and also this
B	well if you panic normally you make it quick and short but you just
A	I said cos
B	you know all the points
A	I know because the guy was looking
B	and I was like erm what am I supposed to say now?
B	yeah probably like
A	right I should probably put my hand up
B	I didn't put my hand up
A	you did at one point
B	oh I did at one point cos I felt I should do
A	yeah and when everyone at the start when everyone went
A	everyone's writing
B	yeah
A	I should probably start writing
B	well I just looked at you and you making things like spider diagrams and stuff er and so I was like okay I'll just copy her
B	spider diagrams
A	but they were all rubbish spider diagrams anyway cos I didn't have any space
A	yeah
B	one for not guilty
A	but I didn't have time like I was so rushed that I just that's why I wanna pre pepare pre preprayer prepare
A	this time
B	yeah just so there's I know what sort of points might come up
A	yeah
B	but I can't believe how biased that school was
A	I know like it doesn't change it they didn't get through anyway did they?
B	no
A	like I dunno
B	yeah like I said one thing about how they how they might be guilty
A	mm
B	and they were like
B	as I said one thing and I can't remember what it was
A	well like you can't really well I felt a bit sorry for all the lawyers because they'd all voted us not guilty and we were like yes get in get in
B	yeah
A	and then we came back and he was like he's not guilty and we're like
B	yeah
A	I think though you couldn't really say he was guilty to be honest like
B	yeah if we said
A	it's like this one as well
B	yeah
A	he's not guilty you can't say he's guilty
B	and if Mr
B	I know
A	to us it really annoyed me
B	I bet he's not even gonna come to any of these meetings now
A	no he's not even
B	I mean
A	coming to the actual thing
B	so he's not coming to the actual thing I mean
A	what a let-down
B	if he's not coming why can't we not go?
B	yeah
A	and she's just been left by herself like
B	she's only supposed to be there to help with
A	yeah he's meant to be doing all the lawyer stuff and
B	he's meant to be doing all it basically
A	yeah he's
B	apart from
A	organised it all of it
B	yeah
A	I don't know why and he can't even be bothered to come on the day
B	yeah
A	mm and Miss
B	so
A	had to drive us
B	yeah
A	I think and then
B	it's really
A	that but erm really but it's gonna be so far away in Kent
B	I know
A	why can't we just do it in
B	yeah why can't
A	to do it I don't mind doing it but
B	mm yeah mm well I don't
A	I'll I like it but I don't wanna go to Kent
B	but I did enjoy it
A	if we're on the minibus for that long
A	yeah and I'll
B	we need to go with Miss
A	yeah I'll probably feel really like
B	sick
A	carsick after that because in the minibus cos I can't look out the window
B	yeah well that's why we have to go in Miss
A	yeah but if they're gonna take if they can take the minibus we don't need to go in Miss
B	you need to go in the front then
A	yeah no I don't I'm not actually going to be sick I'm never sick not like
B	yeah
A	I don't care how sick I feel
B	I'll sit at the back
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	probably not cos she hates
A	I was
B	both of us
A	yeah
B	it's gonna be so awkward oh my
A	I'm not going
B	it's like
A	no because we have nothing in common I'm like
B	I mean she doesn't hate you as much as she hates
A	well I don't think she
B	me erm
A	she doesn't hate you she probably doesn't like you at all
B	erm but at least she's sort of at least she talks to you basically without
A	yeah but I can't I can't think of anything to say back and she says random stuff like are you happy with your body?
B	it's gonna be so awkward she's gonna like sit in the back with us
A	let's just go and sit in a two
B	yeah
A	or she's gonna be yeah but bet you million pounds she's gonna be can I sit with you guys? and we'll be like
B	what we need to do is you know erm the minibus is always there and you can always like sit there as soon as we arrive?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you
A	come early
B	you will probably
A	I'll be early
B	be there early so you
A	to sit in a two
B	sit in a two and save me the space
A	yeah
B	and then if
B	yeah probably
A	and we'll all be waiting for her
B	and she'll turn up in like her bikini
A	kini
B	and her like fancy
A	dress over the top
A	yeah
B	or whatever
A	oh my god
B	and then we're gonna get there and she's gonna see that she has to put on a still wet
A	a soggy wetsuit
B	cold wetsuit
B	she's gonna scream so much we need to get
A	when we have to put our feet in the water
B	away
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I think she's just doing it to prove see that she's sporty so she can go on the South Africa trip
B	yeah
A	because otherwise why on earth would she by herself?
B	yeah it'll like oh why
A	I'm level one
A	but the annoying thing is that we can't level two now
B	yeah I know because they're all new people
A	yeah
B	I wish they like let the people that have been before do it instead of the new people
A	yeah
B	cos I know they need to like let everyone
A	have a go
B	have a go but
A	or they can have a different course for people that have been before
B	yeah exactly that's
A	so like one for new people and one for
B	and they would make their money's worth cos
A	yeah
B	cos it's not it won't cos them that much more
A	no
B	yeah
A	because they've already done it for two years
B	yeah but I I swear they said it was first come first served
A	probably but er
B	oh actually yeah that's true
B	and
A	no
B	whereas we paid it as soon as we handed in the form
A	yeah yeah
B	so it might have been a first come
A	yeah
B	first served
A	or
B	next year
A	they just
B	we need to be quick
A	yeah or it was just
B	even though we're probably not going to be able to do it
A	yeah
B	it's better to
A	but also because and like obviously if they thought oh okay it's oversubscribed
B	yes
A	before they haven't actually
B	I still think they should
A	picked the names out of a hat
B	yeah I still think they should do first come first served
A	yeah
B	cos
A	yeah
B	because then at least you're not like oh that's so annoying just because I've done it before
A	yeah but then because then they could say to
B	you weren't quick enough sorry
A	it was because you weren't quick enough
B	and then it's like a good excuse
A	mm
B	to not make them so annoyed
A	yeah
B	yeah that's true
A	okay
B	she didn't pay for ages
A	I think they probably should have told you if you could do it before they made you pay
B	yeah I know
A	because then it takes ages for you to get your money back and everything
B	have they got their money back yet? no
A	no
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah well
A	yeah
B	it's not really that
A	bad
B	yeah
A	I mean I can get why it's annoying cos then you have to go and cash it in
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	but it's not like a a massive deal
B	deal
A	it's probably just because
B	yeah
A	that she really just wants to
B	but I think that could work the
A	yeah
B	like get them to
A	but then I also feel a bit sorry for them because they don't get to actually get the well actually they don't need it cos they've already done it before
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's better than no times and our it's kind of a waste of a place
A	yeah
B	when we only go two
A	two
B	and don't do anything with the second one
A	mm
B	cos then they'll probably
B	be like
A	mm
B	we've done it before and you're only doing it two times
A	well at least they've actually let us do it
B	yeah
A	I bet we won't I bet we'll
B	I know we won't
A	just
B	er or I'll bet they'll do it the second time
A	well yeah
B	while we're not there
A	exactly
B	but if they do
A	so am I
B	gonna be like
B	you made us go on this especially if we don't go through
A	well we won't go through
B	I know
B	yeah I know but
A	and then I know
B	yeah we only just scraped through
A	yeah
B	that time I wish we'd either been really good and went through or just went out
A	yeah
B	it
A	doing it
B	yeah
A	so I'm sure I'll like doing it when we go if it goes well
B	yeah
A	cos it went so well in the
B	if it goes badly
A	that in it went so well in Basildon but like
B	and
A	and to go so
B	are gonna
A	I know and to go so far as well
B	yeah
A	already know that we're not gonna be able to go through
B	this straw
B	mm
A	and we were all like
B	yeah
A	oh
A	no this was the regional no
B	no this is the regional finals isn't it?
A	it's not a final I think if there was
B	no the regional finals and then it goes into the national
A	yeah
B	so the first was like the regional
A	county county
B	it wasn't quite county though
A	yeah but that's cos we had to switch
B	yeah it was something like the regional firsts
A	yeah
B	it's basically counties and then there's regional final
A	and then national which is
B	yeah
A	gonna happen isn't it? and will probably in somewhere like Birmingham
B	yeah
A	if we go all the way through
B	hope we don't
B	mm
A	lose right
B	like if you get to the final and you come second
A	yeah that's like the most disappointing
B	mm
A	thing like when I did the panto auditions when I was like eleven or something and I went there and I got through to the final bit and then me and like four other girls didn't get through and they were lining up the final people in their pairs on the stage and we were just sitting at the back like
B	oh
A	and then we got sent away we got sent home and and then there was one girl that was properly in hysterics she was crying so hard
A	she was like I wanted to be in the
B	oh yeah
A	year six or something? me and her we didn't get through but her sister got through I felt so bad her little sister got through
B	yeah
A	but she didn't
B	her little sister?
A	yeah
B	oh right not her bigger sister
A	and they told me it was because I didn't have anyone who was my height they could have found someone I'm sure they could have found
B	well what do they mean they
A	because you have to be in partners that are of a similar height
B	oh right
A	and there was nobody that was my height but maybe they just thought I was rubbish that was probably just that excuse
B	yeah I'm sorry
A	I'm sorry
B	there's no one your height
A	yeah that's why I hate competitions it's like
B	yeah
A	it's really hard or auditions
B	oh are you still doing
A	I am stopping now
B	stopping in summer
A	yeah
B	summers
A	so that when you start the
B	what at the end of the year?
A	yeah
B	the
A	so that I can like do the work
A	and then start the GCSEs
B	oh yeah I guess that's true
A	I'm excited for that actually I've not decided
B	for what? stopping
A	to start no to start all the new stuff except I know it's like
B	yeah at least then I'll only have lessons that I
A	like
B	well I was gonna say I mean like had lessons and I'm like
A	fifteen hours of science oh
B	not really
A	like
A	I don't know why I did it? why did I do it? like I'm not regretting it that much I still want to do it but
B	but you're you're
A	and she marked my test wrong she gave me eighty percent which isn't even that good
B	no you didn't
A	I got thirty-five I actually did
B	no it wasn't that
A	like no I'm pretty sure I actually did get a really bad mark I'm gonna fail so badly at this test and then the whole class is gonna be like doing the level eight paper and I'm just gonna be there like oh oh
B	I'm not gonna do it
A	well you are
B	I don't think I really want to do it to be honest
B	at the
A	oh my
B	that was so stupid though because we did the SATs
A	yeah
B	and then Mrs
A	mm
B	and then she was like oh we should have entered you in the level six SATs too late
A	wait so
B	so like I'd so that didn't go down in my records that I got a level six
A	that
B	so when I entered
A	oh so you did the SATs and the she just thought you know what? I'm just gonna randomly
B	for fun
A	for fun
B	yeah exactly
A	just give people the level six paper
B	to see if you could have got a level six
B	and I was the only one that got a level six
B	and I looked really rubbish
A	well no you didn't cos Mr
B	well
A	I know
B	cos that was in tutor
A	yeah she was so annoyed she was almost like oh
B	but I'm not
A	well
B	sorry
A	you are very good at everything
B	no
A	you're like erm
B	I'm not
A	you are you are you're in top set
B	mm
A	everything
B	yeah I don't know how I managed
A	you're turning into me
B	I don't know how I managed to get into top set PE to be honest
A	well that's cos you're good at PE it's cos the
A	teachers like you
B	yeah they like me
A	the teachers they
B	they felt sorry for me that whole terrible
A	no all the teachers love you I'm sorry you got five
A	for being a good friend
B	yeah well I got that one as well
A	for making yeah
B	that was one of my five
A	yeah I know but that was one of my two
B	well you helped me
A	I did help you
B	you helped me get everyone and stuff
A	yeah but you filmed it you edited it you brought in the memory stick
B	mm
A	did the whole video
B	I even painted on
A	thanks
B	this memory stick
B	on it and it was like
A	ah and then she went and got quite a lot of eyeliner
B	yeah and then changed yeah
A	she changed
A	I just I just can't I don't really
B	yeah
A	table in the corner? it was like there and
B	why didn't she just
A	because
B	why didn't she sit with
B	but why wasn't she sitting with
A	because
B	oh right
A	and then
A	next to but then
B	next to
A	obviously
A	and then she just copied me
B	that's so
A	she looked over and she was like oh my gosh you're on question three already and I was like er yeah she was like I haven't even started and I was like
A	okay then she just copied mine
B	neither can I I mean and
A	yeah not with
B	sometimes
B	not like weirdo stuff
B	really annoying
A	she came into art and erm she was talking to
A	and then I was just standing there like raging up like
B	yeah it really annoys me that
A	mm
B	if you know what I mean it's like they join one group and like talk about someone
A	mm
B	like how much they hate them then the next day they like talk to that person like oh all these people were talking about you
B	they were saying all these horrible stuff
B	and it's like how do you actually know they were saying this horrible stuff?
B	were involved in saying this horrible stuff?
A	but
B	like especially
A	yeah
B	she does that loads
A	and
B	yeah and
A	I find it I
B	yeah
A	I find it really awkward I can't think of any topics of conversation and she comes over to me she's like to us and she's like oh
B	yeah but she only says that because basically she's looking for
A	compliments
B	you can tell
A	yeah
B	because she's like all I play is piano
B	as if we're she's waiting for us to say oh you're amazing at the piano though
B	no she's not
A	like
B	I mean she's better than me but
A	yeah she's better than me as well
B	yeah so do I
A	it takes me like three
B	it takes me hours
A	hours to figure out
B	just to figure out what
A	yeah
B	one note is on the bass clef
A	yeah
B	cos I know you just like move it up two
A	I know but then how to do play at the same time
B	it's
A	reading it?
B	yeah it's really hard
A	so it looks like the same note but it's actually not
B	yeah
A	and you're like
B	I need to figure
A	I don't even know
B	and be able to figure out which one's which?
A	yeah just so quickly and just
B	oh it's so confusing
A	play it like that and then not look at the keys whilst you're playing it
B	yeah
A	and just look at the music like
B	yeah cos I understand if you just keep your hand the same and you know where they are but when it's like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	all up and down the octaves
A	oh
B	oh it's so hard
A	I really don't know
B	it takes me hours
A	I
B	first of all I need to figure what each note is
A	yeah
B	and then practice it for hours each hand and then try and put them together
A	yeah
B	it's so hard
B	yeah I know
A	and it's a bit unfair because it's not like I really
B	I don't want to sing but
A	well I don't really mind I kind of want to sing a little bit just as a group not
B	yeah I don't wanna sing a solo I don't really
A	no and I don't want her to sing a solo
B	I don't
A	I'd rather sing a like I'd rather
B	yeah
A	that's maybe we should actually
B	I I think we should because I mean
B	I know that seems really
A	music what's gonna happen? but she's she's
B	oh well
A	very I don't know but she
B	yeah I mean what sort of
A	she's she's
B	question is that?
B	even if I was actually I was kind of
B	I'm not gonna say it to her face
A	yeah
B	that I'm annoyed at her
A	you should have done that when he said groups of four or five you should have been like well sir can we go in pairs?
B	yeah or
A	oh why didn't you?
B	gone with gone to Mr
A	yeah
B	we need to do that when we ask we need to ask Mr
A	yeah
B	because he will say yes
A	with this well he really likes well cos
B	yeah I know
A	and she's like
A	I was like oh shut up for god's sake
B	oh
A	and I took three years of
B	like she's nice I
A	of persuading
B	I I feel bad for not liking her
A	yeah
B	but I really don't like her
A	I know
B	because she is nice and she's kind of friendly
A	yeah until you get
B	but as soon as you're like in a group with her she's so bossy
A	I know
B	doesn't listen to any of your
A	and now I feel really sorry for
B	opinions
B	so do I I was feeling sorry for
A	yeah because she was by herself like with
B	and and they were like oh she's just taking over
A	yeah
