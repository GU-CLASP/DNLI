C	okay would you like a cup of tea?
A	it it would be nice

A	on my programme anyway so that erm he's that happy he thinks he wants one for his wedding exhibitions that they go to
B	yeah
A	erm
B	that is a beautiful job you've done
C	that is lovely
A	I was chuffed with it it's a nice finish and also I think he he liked the erm that matt finish makes it rather than a gloss
B	gloss is awful though
A	yeah it's awful yeah although some things and what I discovered with and I've worked out how to do hand painting it came to me on the way back
B	yeah
A	because the problem is right if you well the first
B	no you need outside ply
A	outside ply so I need to and I've got lots of that I've got that left left from the from the back of the van
B	yeah
A	that's really its been in the back of the van for years and it's tough old stuff
B	it is
A	yeah and few coats of primer on that sanded down
B	oh can you?
A	mirror cut
C	you can cut what?
A	mirror
B	mirror images
A	mirror images so I seek
C	ah
A	I draft what I want tell the machine to cut it a mirror image
C	yeah?
A	and then it'll cut the mirror image and there and then the adhesive
B	yeah
A	so you just tape it on the side
B	oh I see yeah yeah
C	okay
A	quick waft over with a primer
B	yeah
A	lift off what you've taped on and you've got your image ready to paint
C	ah
C	right yeah
A	what takes the time is the layout
C	yes
A	and getting what you want so now you you say how does you can sent that I can send that do that digitally say is that alright? and that this is something cos I I if we are opening the church
C	mm
A	we do need to have somebody there and erm I I could see a lot of Saturday's I'm gonna be there well if I'm sitting there drafting paintings
B	yeah
A	it's a lovely thing to be doing I can do it outside
B	yeah quiet church
C	yeah
A	yeah it's lovely erm doing signs like that
B	is it the
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	mm
A	so we're opening every Wednesday now as er from ten till four
C	yeah
A	that's that's six hours innit?
B	that is six hours
A	six hours and no one's volunteering to do it
C	you get many people go in?
A	don't know oh they do
C	they do? oh
A	on a Wednesday on a Wednesday when the boys are there erm oh they quite often have people visiting there
C	oh good that's good
A	I don't think they actually supervise it they're busy round the back and stuff could disappear out the front where
B	I will have one
A	so I can see I'm gonna be doing it but I that doesn't matter if I can if I've got something I can get on with
B	no no
A	it doesn't matter at all
B	no you're very good at
A	erm
B	yeah
A	erm so that's
B	well you're very artistic so you you should be able to
A	well that's what I always really wanted to do
B	yeah
A	but it takes too long you can't
B	I know it does but I mean you have to have a little bit of patience and if you're sitting down there for ages
A	mm well I got one potential customer already cos
B	no
A	well
B	yeah?
A	and erm so well no she didn't phone she sent an email said I'm a friend of
B	oh yes you did say yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm so if she doesn't find anybody to do it at a sensible price for her I've said look later on in the year when I've got the end of June it quietens down a bit
B	yeah
A	erm and then
A	so erm I erm
B	no you don't no
A	with that would spoil the other surface but if you then cut the mirror image you can turn it on its back and you've got the right image oh I tell you what you haven't got you can hold the middles together that doesn't matter you won't need the middles
B	no
A	you won't need the middles oh yes you will but ah
B	yes you will yeah
A	yes you will ah ha right
B	mm
A	mm
B	well what about
A	no you don't need the middles because you can get all the widths and everything and everything er I just can't spray it
B	yeah
A	that's it
B	yeah
A	that's fine
B	you could
A	so I just where there's a middle I just add a little bits
B	yeah
A	yeah that doesn't matter cos the paint I use it er will be used is called one shot
B	yeah
A	very expensive for a small tin but it that's a one coat cover of anything
B	yeah
A	it's real it's it's it's only for sign makers
B	yeah
A	and I think the way
B	yeah what like in the little jet
A	then they do no they're a bit bigger
B	oh are they?
A	er four fifty mil I think
B	oh right
A	yeah erm but they do a special primer special undercoat but it's all it all the whole thing is a whole
B	it's a package yeah
A	erm and then I know then that that paint will flow out modern paint you buy doesn't flow out
B	no
A	it it doesn't
B	yeah what about cleaning your brushes do you have to use anything special for that?
A	white spirit
B	white spirit
A	yeah
B	oh that's alright then white spirit
A	mm yeah it's all all all there
B	cos there was lots of stuff you you or some stuff
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	then I'm stuck there I can't do anything else can I?
B	course you can't
C	yeah might be good for you
A	might be good for me yeah
A	but it's a lot
B	did you get an email from
A	no
B	no
B	no
B	no
C	big tall
B	big tall
B	yes
A	oh oh that
B	did you get one?
A	no
B	oh cos he's asking for volunteers for the world
C	I didn't know we'd asked yeah we did it last year
B	yeah
A	oh no no
C	have you volunteered then?
B	I haven't yet no
A	all I'm all I'm all I'm gonna I must have a word with erm
B	yeah?
A	I think that'll be good that erm if he's happy that cos he said yes it's fine as long as you're as long as you're in the erm
C	are you allowed half?
A	no
B	you're not allowed cake that's even more sugar than biscuits we've got no cake anyway have we?
A	mm
C	no we're out of cake at the moment
A	so anyway
B	you can't have your cake and eat it can you?
A	no
A	erm what will be he said yes it's fine in the church
B	yeah?
A	but we've got
B	that's yeah that's true
B	when we had a we had a video run didn't we about er about the whole
C	that's well
A	well well yes that's what it's for
B	yeah
A	and it I felt it didn't really work did it?
A	it kept
C	no
A	you've gotta keep stopping and starting it and then people who are in there see it over and over and over again
C	mm
A	it doesn't really work that but anyhow erm
B	mm
A	then they probably play the bells for nothing you see
B	oh yeah
A	erm and that would all help it all goes it's all towards the tower fund
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and then I've got the make I'm gonna make have I told you what I'm gonna make?
C	mm
A	make a tower with the looking at
B	mm
A	from the end with with the shape of the church
B	yeah
A	behind with information on it about
B	yeah
A	about it and you could put money on coins and lift a lift a flap that will ring a bell if you put put the biggest bell is the one if you put a note in
B	oh
A	you put put well well my theory
B	yeah but will people want to know that they're
C	how are you gonna work that?
B	will they really want to know that some
C	yeah
B	they're putting a
C	no don't do that
B	twenty pence in or
A	just all the same bell it brings the same
C	that'd be so embarrassing
B	the same bell
A	it brings the same bell
B	yeah if you have a if you have a pound
A	no no no just that I was gonna have one alright no that's fine so er
C	but I suppose if you put in a load of coins it would loads tuppences will it go ding ding ding ding ding?
A	well somehow I've gotta build a flap so that when they put it in put it in a flap and it's when they
B	mm
A	when they pull on it on the button
B	yeah
A	I'm not quite sure how to do that yep but I'm sure I will think about it
C	mm
A	erm it won't take long to make it and it just the information we need to raise so and so and have a thermometer because we've got I think we've got twenty something thousand saved towards it
B	have you?
C	yeah
A	I'm I'm guessing now something like that but that is ring fenced it can't be people have given it for the tower
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but we've also got money in a fabric fund which erm is just from normal funds that are coming we put it in maintain
B	what is that er tower that that we
B	that was the
C	yeah
B	yeah I
A	well we'll see I doubt we'll get much but anything helps erm you've gotta show that you're fundraising as well because
B	well of course you have
C	but I remember
B	but it's also in the interest of the church the diocese and and the whole community and people who are interested in churches cos that's
A	yeah
B	that's a really brilliant church innit?
A	beautiful church yeah the last chap I showed round
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	erm and erm then the people I took round in October if you look on erm the
B	yeah yeah
A	they they they put all their stuff they work for
C	right
B	oh right
A	they never let on and erm they so they said we we had visited once before and couldn't get in and this time there was a list of numbers and we phoned the number first on the list and I think we must have woken him up
C	yeah
A	it's a erm because he he didn't wasn't couldn't grasp what we were trying to ask or something and then he went on and then they they've got wonderful pictures of the church and a lovely write up and then we bid farewell with a friendly wave you know and and that's that's nice you you can see it I think it's the
B	yeah?
C	okay
A	and then next
B	oh right yeah
A	and she's doing three churches locally
B	mm
C	mm
A	she's doing
A	no
A	erm so and she said what is good about what we do for you? cos I haven't twigged it is that you'll get a lot of money from it
A	so you'll need a bigger collection box than you've got there we've got a little one there so
A	so I'm looking
B	yeah
A	and they go for a load of money
B	they do they do
A	I might have to make one
B	yeah
A	you know or if you've got any idea if you've got a whole box of make look might have to make one
C	you can make things look old can't you? erm
A	but the other thing is you see you can't you can't screw it on anything so I think it'll need something like a bit of wire coming out the bottom and just sort of go round the bottom of something round hook it onto a pew or something funny
B	yeah yeah
C	why? you mean you can't trust
A	it needs to be fixed
B	well you can't trust people how
A	oh no you couldn't just leave them you couldn't just leave the box
C	mm
A	erm
B	well had our our stuff nicked outside we you know
A	yeah you said
B	yeah
C	remember when eh sometimes
A	that's why you had to
B	that's right
A	mm
B	yeah
C	these churches and that and castles even they have what an honesty box don't they? right?
A	yeah
B	yeah but it's usually cemented to the post
C	wait a minute it's in stone
B	yeah
A	mm
C	so your holes goes in in the stone
B	that's right it does yeah
A	mm
C	mm
A	that's it tubes got me thinking now
C	and they it looks part of the er
B	mm mm
A	and then I got in trouble for putting the those signs up about the fire exit
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	what for?
B	of course they do yeah
C	mm
A	can't be moveable if it says fire exit keep clear
B	yeah
A	and I thought well it look you can't have a paying event in a place without people knowing how to get out
B	yeah
A	so I
B	unless you have an airline hostess
A	doing the bit
A	yeah yeah no well also you've gotta tell them that the tower isn't an exit you don't want people flying in there and falling in a heap and finding it
A	so I did did not supposed to have done it but then oh well we'll see how it goes
C	yeah
B	well who tells you off then?
A	well I was on the way there and I I I I bumped into
B	mm
A	and I told her what I was gonna do I said I've got some lovely little glass screws I thought that would be the easiest way
B	yeah
A	just a little glass screw in the door erm and then all you've got to do is take it out and you can fill the hole
B	yeah
A	erm but you can't put you can't hammer or screw in anywhere without
C	yeah
A	cos it's a it's a listed building so it's a
B	that is yeah
C	no you can't do it
B	yeah
A	same with a listed house you can't do it
B	no
A	erm you can't do it erm so she said what about Blu-Tack? er no it won't stick with Blu-Tack so in the end I'd used
B	yeah
A	it's not I haven't damaged the wood
C	yeah but
A	health and safety the people are more important
B	well yeah when when health and safety that overrides most stuff health and safety
C	yeah
A	I would have thought actually while I was doing it I discovered that if you if you were to run out if there was a fire and you ended up in the in the erm the little vestry the door our from the vestry is about oh almost eighteen inches drop to to the ground level
C	yeah
A	to put a step outside but that's outside you can do you can do it however you like it doesn't matter
B	yeah
A	but it's erm even that
B	but you
A	oh yeah well I've I've got a big old slab you know I used to have on my front door?
B	yeah
A	I I need someone helping me do
B	yeah
A	so
C	mm
B	that shouldn't take long but with step in
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean it would be nice if we had a great lump of stone that would match nicely
B	yeah
B	can't you take a lump of stone out of the tower?
A	well I don't know you see that no one quite knows what's what's underneath all that
B	yep yep but you see that mould you see with everything
A	yeah
B	lime mortar's one of the best I mean they supply these
A	it's soft that's why
B	these old cottages have stood for hundreds of years
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	the rough line'll go like that but they're still standing
A	yeah
C	mm
B	you know they're
A	walls
B	yeah yeah they're
B	yeah
A	I can understand why they do what it what it is that if you if that was a house you'd have to go to a government organisation to get permission to do stuff to it
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	erm but the church because we've got so many old buildings they're nearly all old
C	yeah
B	yeah course they are
A	have permission to do it and they it a faculty rather than a planning permission to do it
B	yeah
A	and so they have to stick to the same rules otherwise that privilege of being able to decide themselves whether the could do something
C	yeah
A	will be taken away and then everything'll take
C	that's true
A	even longer it takes long enough as it is
B	it does doesn't it? yeah
B	you would you would yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah now apparently one of the major things that people nick are erm uncarved wooden storage boxes old ones
B	really?
A	old oak yeah the really old things that maybe store candles erm
B	oh I see
A	cloth stuff like that you know like like a big ottoman that that's the one of the major things people nick
B	that must be these er these people that know about these things
A	mm
C	yeah
B	you know a gang of them go round and
A	well it'd be it'd be easy for a gang to go in posing with cameras and things even while someone was looking after the place
B	yeah
A	and they wonder round and when they've gone you find all the well I've also just discovered reading up I was looking at the wrong erm insurance company I thought we we're ecclesiastical we're not we're church something insurance
B	no
A	and you definitely don't leave candles or anything that would start a fire so and they preferably shouldn't even be left on the premises
B	yeah
A	but so I'm gonna take them and put them in the er erm vestry
C	vestry
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	won't look as nice but then I can see it
C	yeah
A	because one of the places apparently that they they start fires under the organ
B	is it?
A	oh imagine a load of candles under the pedals
B	yeah
A	that'd gather that wonderful old timber that
B	yeah
A	get going in no time wouldn't it?
B	it would wouldn't it? yeah
A	erm so
B	well they won't
A	a photograph I've had them all for all the
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but one one of the the painting you see as you go in the door dead ahead
B	mm mm
A	erm that one he just he just grabbed it lifted it off the wall put it down by the lectern by the erm the fonts
B	yeah
A	to get the decent the sun was all wrong on it to get a good picture and just went up
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	just hanging there the other one's the same
C	mm
A	it just hangs but now we've got photographs
B	trouble is if it ain't easy what they do is cut it out the frame and nick the middle of it
A	well yeah
C	in fact you're not gonna stop anything are you?
A	no if it's gonna happen if it's gonna happen it'll happen but what we have now
C	but
A	the pictures he's taken are that quality that we could er we could replace it with a
B	yeah
A	erm but there's but people want to see the original scene but if it did go then you could just have a digital print there that that and one with a
B	mm
A	that erm that one has got a strange frame and he reckons that you you could just actually print the whole frame on it
B	yeah
A	and that'd be fine so so you could you could replace what it looked like but not the real thing
B	yeah
C	not the same
B	not the real thing
A	I know but what do you do? there's no point having a church not open
C	no
A	erm cos no one's got it then you know? no one can use it
C	no
B	so
A	is there any security cameras
B	no
A	it's an alarm alarm system
B	yeah but they
C	actually
B	the security cameras would would catch it
C	they're not that expensive now are they?
B	no not the security cameras aren't no
C	cameras really
A	well you can get smart
B	no
C	you could have it just just
B	that's
C	just aimed at the door so you know people in
A	so everyone
C	the people that
A	oh could just people coming in
C	that's all they need
A	mm oh and it would see them going as well wouldn't it?
B	yeah
C	I mean we've got a teeny tiny one it didn't cost anything really at all but
A	mm
C	the birds you know
B	for the for the birds nest outside
C	so if you can
B	oh its nearly blown off the wall the bird
C	has it?
A	actually is
B	that's gone all twisted
C	oh yeah
B	that's the
C	but you know so cameras don't cost that much now
A	no they don't
B	mm
C	and they're very erm
A	mm
B	they're very small
C	unnoticeable
A	mm I did a load of signs for
C	yeah they don't have to be those big things that follow you around
A	erm
B	well if you look in
A	yeah
C	mm
B	they're on they're on these great big
A	mm
B	nobody can reach them you can't
C	mm
B	you can't get up there and
A	but you see again you don't want to be looked at while it
C	no you don't because
B	no you don't know it's true you you want only
A	I think I might just make
B	yeah
A	but the thing is just to be just someone to be there
C	yeah
B	did you see that that there was er the little clip I don't know whether it was on Youtube or whatever but this bloke has erm had his case and they knew that he went to the bank
A	mm
B	every so often and he had his case with him and that get nicked he get mugged
A	mm
B	that get pulled out of his hand
A	mm
B	and they run off and all these spikes come out and then spray everybody
A	really?
B	yeah and then spray the money inside
A	wow
B	so they could never use it
A	wow
B	that was brilliant I don't think that's either
A	wow
B	that was either a clip on the
A	yeah
B	but he he decided that you know he didn't if anybody nicked it he let it go
A	mm mm
B	but he he's got a trigger in there you see
C	as long as it
A	mm
B	and they just pull it out like that pull them from him and the trigger get released
A	and then the
B	released these spikes shot out and this er spray come out and sprayed all the money inside and the people who we're nicking it
A	dad used to send us off to the bank with a brown paper bag with the money in didn't he?
C	yeah
B	yeah I'll bet I'm yeah
C	yeah he sent us didn't he?
A	yeah we used to go to the bank quite a bit
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well I used to have to go to the down to the down to my mum's bank on the bus in a carrier with a carrier bag
C	yeah because they only dealt with cash then it's all they
B	they did
C	no no Barclay card receipts or anything
B	yeah
A	market so he was buying stuff next to
B	yeah
A	on a Sunday we'd we'd deliver it and that was in one of these stripy blue and white cheap
B	yeah
A	carrier bags plastic carrier bags and there'd be a couple of thousand pound in it every time and just put it under the seat in the in the
B	yeah
A	and he showed me once this bloke you know he said
A	you see?
B	yeah
A	erm and and he said look and each and and he opened the door and
C	yeah
A	rolls of notes
B	woah
A	and that was that black economy cos no one knew what they'd do
B	no that's true
B	well our friend
C	mm

A	mm
B	cos it

B	and there laid thirty-five thousand pounds
C	that was a guess though wasn't it?
B	he guessed it but I mean there was a great big pile of notes well he did ask he did ask
C	oh oh okay
B	he left all your money on on there he said I could have just walked out with it you'd have never known
A	mm
B	but he didn't
A	no no no
B	well you don't do you? that'd be on your conscience for the rest of your life wouldn't it?
A	oh yeah
C	oh yeah
B	every every one knock at the door every phone call you'd be going ah
A	yeah no not worth it
B	no it's not worth it

B	that's
B	no
C	mm
A	and so off we went and I'd only looked
B	yeah course
C	mm
A	so I mark mark it wherever the beats come so I know one two
A	erm we didn't our conductor wasn't well so he wasn't there his wife was there and and so she
A	erm but it was lovely you know and they all really appreciated it
B	oh that's good
A	and I I enjoyed it and that's that's a good step up the ladder
C	mm
A	the last one I did I didn't enjoy it because I made a real mess of it I did and the one at
B	did you?
A	yes
C	oh
A	but this time she was all happy it was fine well it did go well we were missing one person and poor old erm
C	yeah that's difficult innit?
A	and so that's why she struggled
C	mm
A	erm and
C	yeah not surprised
A	so so next year we're gonna well
B	well that woman had said
A	but I did I got it right so after a practice and a bit well at home
C	mm
A	thinking it through in my head what I find's good if I'm eating I eat in time you see I put something on
A	that that keeps as I'm chewing yeah? that's the beat going through and I'm following
A	but it was good and we had some we had some lovely cake there as well
B	yeah
A	cake and tea afterwards and go back
B	that's the only reason
A	got to get get given get given a lift there you see
B	you get everything don't you free?
C	yeah well you eat the cake there then
A	pardon?
B	yeah you eat
A	cake is fine I haven't touched a biscuit
B	why is cake fine and biscuits
C	biscuits are better than cake
A	no they're not for me cos once I start a packet of biscuits I eat them
B	oh
C	oh
A	you see so if somebody's offering me a cake
B	well we
C	yeah half a biscuit
B	you wouldn't have got any more
A	well I've decided I'm not touching
C	that's okay
A	see I the thing about this
C	that's good
A	I tend to get addicted
C	no that's good
A	so I will little
C	that is good
A	biscuits are twenty-nine P for the packet
B	yeah ours are only twenty-eight
A	so that oh yours Morrisons ones aren't they?
B	yeah
A	so they're similar but so really I
C	yeah
A	so
C	no
A	and cos it's all in little bits
C	well it's best not to buy
A	at least if it's a cake I've gotta think about the cake haven't I? and cut it you don't just walk past it and
C	so you don't buy cake either?
A	no it's only when I'm offered a cake
C	right that's okay
A	I had an awful one at the at the the national bell ringers thing I went to
A	it didn't taste like butter
B	probably lard
A	it might well have been lard yeah it didn't taste that brilliant but I did eat it
B	yeah
A	so the bell ringing's the bell ringing's that I'm I'm feeling more comfortable with it now I did I did wonder if I'd done the right thing to start with
B	yeah
A	don't think
C	oh right
B	oh I see yeah
B	why don't she like it?
A	well cos one she only got two nights off a week Wednesday and Thursday
C	yeah
A	and Thursday I'm always away
C	out
B	oh I see yeah
A	but it's it is a night I I think probably for my old age it's a good thing cos you've got a you've got to be alert to do this you can't
B	well you've gotta keep your brainbox moving
A	yeah you can't it it you can't relax for a minute if you relax for a minute or if you even think hey this is going well you've lost it
B	yeah
A	you'll have and my usual thing when I get lost is I actually cos I'm used to reading on two lines at the singing cos you've got the base clef and the treble clef
B	yep
A	I sometimes skip a line if it's all written on the one line
B	oh I see yeah yeah
A	you see it's it's tricky sometimes it's written on the one line and sometimes it's written on two lines
C	yeah
A	depending on how many bells you've got
B	yeah
A	so I it it
C	mm
A	if I panic I get lost and if I think oh this is nice I get lost so you've gotta keep a balance in between
C	mm
A	you've gotta keep some try and keep smiling but it's not easy cos you're concentrating like billio
A	but it did it was lovely
B	yeah
A	we had some smashing
A	and things like this yeah yeah
C	mm
A	yeah all sorts of bright jolly things it's nice
B	we used to sing a a naughty song for the Yellow Rose of Texas
A	I know and and there's yes that's what that's exactly what
B	there are naughty words to it
A	yeah and there was another another one which erm we were thinking of doing in church in
B	yeah

C	yeah
A	and that's just walking to and from the car really
C	started burning up
A	when I have been out I've been out quite a bit raking and digging isn't it amazing how all the all the doors for that that erm the two the the two the two gates underneath the l
B	yeah
A	there was a big pile of pebbles behind them so I I've actually shovelled them up put them in a bucket and taken them round the back of the church so that they can now open it depends how they carry them
B	someone
A	they did didn't they? yeah yeah
B	stupid people what do they want that for?
A	for their own gate I suppose
B	they had their own new one made
A	yeah
B	you can see the difference now can't you?
A	yes you can see the difference yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	be lovely to find it somewhere in someone's garden wouldn't it?
A	would be good wouldn't it yeah
B	wouldn't it yeah
A	I'd be going to rescue them
C	wouldn't it be good
B	yeah
A	isn't it amazing I could make arrests well anyone can make arrests anyway but particularly church warden with a
B	citizens
A	wardens were were erm had the right to make arrests before they had the police
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but anyone can make arrests
A	yeah
B	you can make a citizens arrest
A	yeah that's it in Ireland when we were in Ireland we didn't have any more rights than a normal citizen the army did
C	mm
A	so we operated within what anybody could do
B	yeah
A	that was which made life ever so difficult but we did
B	well there you go
A	yeah so you had to follow when when you if you arrested somebody someone had to take a picture of it to prove it was you
B	yeah
A	and you had to say and you said the right things and then at every stage when you handed him onto somebody else we had polaroid pictures in those days polaroid are there each each time he was handed on to somebody else until he got to the jail erm it was all recorded as to who who had done it
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	nightmare
B	we had a
C	hm?
A	had a
B	we had a policeman come round the other day
A	oh did you?
C	yeah so I told you didn't I?
A	oh yeah I heard yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	me assaulting him in
A	yeah ridiculous yeah
C	hm?
A	I don't think they could move could they?
C	they can't what?
A	I can't see I can't see them moving
B	no
C	no
A	I don't think they could move could they?
C	yeah
B	they could I suppose but
C	could do they might if they get pressure from the farmers
B	honestly we go we
C	they're they're really into it now
A	I are they? oh good cos
C	yeah
A	I mean I I
C	yeah we had them come round
A	well I told you if I was a farmer I'd do I'd just put the plough on it and just go straight through and then let them complain about him and then that would set it all of wouldn't it
B	yeah
A	but you know
B	but I mean this is twenty years
A	yeah it's ridiculous
B	and then you get something else happen
A	yeah yeah
B	can you understand that? I mean they leave it for so long and then decide oh my fence ain't in the right place and we'll we'll have another two foot of next doors land
C	well they've been here about thirty years haven't they?
B	yeah
C	living here you know I mean
A	but I mean it's all even the
B	yeah
A	the highways would if they came
C	yeah
A	somebody came and checked that you it's so obvious it's blatant isn't it?
B	it is blatant yeah
A	and the line and the line hedge line running down and look what they've done in the field
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	crazy
C	mm
B	why though? I mean it's not for anyone's benefit is it? it's not for their benefit they don't benefit for anything they just leave it the place is an absolute scruffy mess at the back there
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	I know I know I think it's just something in their mind it's something
C	yes something they've got
A	just
C	because they've always always fenced and
A	yeah
C	all sorts of fencing we've had
A	yeah
B	yeah well
C	all sorts
B	all sorts
A	over the years
B	chicken wire
A	yeah
C	I think they've tried everything big panels
B	panels
C	trellis
B	trellis yeah
A	mm yeah
C	and er chestnut
B	now this great big monstrosity look like a tennis court behind there don't it? you know
C	and the and their and their chain link fencing this side has got on the driveway
B	yeah
C	if you see they've got concrete posts they have
B	yeah they've got concrete posts along along our driveway
C	and they've got one bit of er chain-link
A	oh they're putting they're doing it along there are they?
C	yeah

A	they can't move no they can't a good job that tree's there yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah they're nuts aren't they?
C	it's just
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	cos that I mean that don't benefit them
A	no
C	no
A	no it doesn't
C	not at all
B	I mean they can't do anything

A	yep yeah
C	you'll always get them
B	well it'll happen
