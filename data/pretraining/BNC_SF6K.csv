B	yeah I know they are I'll give you a hand with those
A	you've got loads I mean you've got no room in the potting shed now
B	well when when the tomatoes are gone we can put them in there

B	yeah
A	no they cos they they just they just drooping now the tomatoes are
B	I know one's broken right off hasn't it?
A	well it is October near enough

A	I think they should be picked put on the window sill and
B	and see if they ripen?
A	yeah if not we can make green tomato chutney
A	I don't want you to buy them big old things again with the hard cores in them
B	I don't want to buy any again yeah if we do it will be just those the Dutch ones
A	mm
B	and the vine on the vine
A	yeah I don't understand why they've got this core in them any more we never had tomatoes with cores in did we?
B	it's it's a waste of money I think
A	how much are they?
B	what tomatoes?
A	tomato seeds you bought the tomato seeds didn't you?
B	yeah I thought you were talking about buying tomatoes in the winter in the supermarket
A	no I'm talking about buying the seeds with them big old things and they had this thick core in that we have to cut out
B	yeah is is that the
A	yeah
B	the funny looking one?
A	yeah
B	you don't like that?
A	well I like the juice they're very juicy but you cut there's a big hard fibrous core in them
B	but I'm not so keen on the
A	Moneymakers
B	mm
A	they got a core in this year as well now I I don't understand it because we never had cores in them before
B	Gardener's Delight they're they're the best

A	yeah well
B	I don't like those big ones
A	that's the five types you've got to get rid of well bar for the little one
B	I wouldn't grow those big ones again
A	no
B	they're a horrible colour
A	yeah they are a weird colour aren't they they're sort of
B	yeah it's like they haven't they're not ripened
A	pale orange
B	mm
A	well they don't seem as though they're ripened because they've got cos those big ones have got the big core in them
B	oh I see they were they were the large ones supposed to be large one
A	yeah they're good
B	Enrico or something
A	yeah I never come across tomatoes with with such a fibrous core in before ever
B	no
A	it won't it can't be the compost we put them in could it?
B	no
A	no
B	no they've they've been really good you have to say they have been excellent
A	oh they're lovely tomatoes but the core is awful
B	no I won't have them again
B	I know
A	and there's peppers
B	that that used to be the best for the peppers
A	there's one there's one set there's one set behind that have got they look as though they want feeding or something because they're very yellow
B	they do yellow aren't they
A	I mean the leaves are yellow
B	mm I think it's a bit late now isn't it
A	yeah you don't need any more do you you've got about fifteen thousand god peppers coming out your earholes
B	well when i cooked them this
A	yeah
B	char the skill the skin that alarm the alarm went off oh it was so loud
A	was it? yeah
B	and I couldn't stop it I didn't know how to pull it out luckily it stopped
A	oh and that's the alarm in the hall
B	mm
A	well you don't have one in the kitchen anyway do you
B	no
A	cos it would be going off all the time
B	probably would wouldn't it we don't burn a lot of things well they don't burnt burnt they were just charred like your meant to
A	yeah but it's obvious that that that sort of er very sort of fine
B	yeah I'm glad it did go
A	yeah
B	because he haven't tested them for quite a while have we
A	no we haven't no they should be tested
B	we should go round and test them all make sure the batteries are alright
A	but the batteries do go beep beep when when they're run out
B	yeah but I know there's one that hasn't got one in
A	dear oh dear whatever is Mr fireman going to say if he come in to expect you?
B	well we have got eight I think
A	we have got eight haven't we
B	I think we'd be quite safe
A	yeah ah that one in your sewing room hasn't got anything in it
B	no that's probably one of the most important to have one in
A	yes it is
B	cos I left the iron on
A	yeah
B	or something
A	oh dear yeah
B	or I used my heat gun
A	yes you've got your heat gun up there and your oh
B	and my soldering iron they're all kind of
A	bit hot
B	could be could be dangerous things couldn't they

B	yeah I'll sort that out
A	you're not to work in there until it's done
B	okay
A	you're banned so it's no good saying oh I'm going up to my sewing room
B	I think you'd know if you had to escape quite easily
A	that's not the point
B	yeah it is what's the point of having an alarm go off and yet?
A	suppose I leave the soldering iron in the shed on
B	oh I see
A	mm mm
B	oh I'll get you one they're only a couple of pound anyway
A	yeah I know yeah

B	yeah
A	I mean we had that lady come up to measure the milk every year every month didn't we
B	mm
A	every month she came up to do the milk from the milk marketing board
B	yep it was all official
A	and that's the best milker in the country that was
B	yeah
A	we got the most milk in the country
B	we did
A	and that was all down by the milk marketing board
B	mm yeah it was a good time wasn't it it was
A	and it's so lucky she lived in
B	I know yeah and she gave us all those er gave us a load of trees to plant
A	that's right yeah
B	probably thought oh I need to get rid of these trees who could I give them to?
A	she was a nice lady though
B	yeah she was
A	did we have to pay for that?
B	yes we paid a lot of money several hundred
A	yeah just to have the goat the milk measured
B	yeah but it was kind of important to us to be recognised really
A	oh we did get recognised didn't we
B	that's what you do isn't it you have to pay unfortunately for this that and the other
A	yeah
B	otherwise you don't get anywhere
A	I remember the
B	yeah
A	had to sleep in a pen in a goat's pen
B	yeah then we came to see you no you had to come and fetch us the next day did you?
A	I had to come fetch you didn't
B	cos we didn't have a car two cars
A	no
B	yeah
A	I came and fetched you
B	came and fetched us first thing in the morning
A	yeah
B	that was good then
A	that was good and that's where we lost
B	only briefly didn't we
A	yeah I know but she she wandered off didn't she
B	yeah
A	and that was it she was just looking at the rabbits the other side of the rabbit cage
B	yeah
A	and we thought where's she gone?
B	disappeared oh there you are
A	oh dear
B	mm
A	where you yeah god that oh dear yeah
B	panicky for a little while wasn't it
A	it was panicky for about two minutes but there you are that was twelve pound a pen and I had to buy a pen for me to sleep in
B	yeah so we've spent a lot of money over we wouldn't dream of spending that now
A	no I mean you're you're talking thirty thirty-five years ago
B	yeah it was a lot of money wasn't it
A	it was yeah the only thing we didn't have to pay for was the parking
B	yeah we got all got in free but I suppose that paid for half of it
A	we got in free yeah so that was it yeah yeah
B	mm
A	and now it's about twelve quid to park and twelve quid to get in each person well twelve quid to park and twelve quid each person to get in I I
B	it's more than that
A	yeah I think it's twenty-five
B	it's double that I think
A	I think it's twenty-five now
B	yeah it is
A	that's a wonder anyone go
B	yeah
A	still if you if you think how much we paid then it's all relevant isn't it
B	I guess so yeah
A	it must be
B	but not many people do go now really
A	well I don't know they had a hundred-thousand last year
A	on on the Thursday and about eighty-thousand on the Wednesday
B	yeah erm
A	and if they if it didn't pay they wouldn't have it would they
B	no they wouldn't they wouldn't get anyone going would they
A	no god I always remember when when we used to go to school because the school was on the A47 as well they used to give us two days off
B	yeah well they did up up here in the beginning
A	yeah
B	we had two days everyone had two days off
A	and then they just had Thursday off and now they get none
B	and now they don't mm I think they had did they have Thursday off last last year I believe
A	I think they're allowed Thursday off I think
B	I think they did in the end because they realised that it was stopping a lot of families going
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	otherwise they've got to get permission to get leave school now to take them out of school
B	not sure
A	yeah of course they do the
B	yeah
A	god
B	that was a big get together for them they don't see anyone otherwise
A	well all the farmers have
B	bit remote job really isn't it
A	that used to make me laugh all the farmers used to get together there
B	yeah
A	and they used to go in the beer tent and
B	yeah
A	they used to have a wonderful time
B	probably don't see each other from year to year
A	no but I think now you see that's less less er popular because there's so much legislation about movement of cattle now isn't there cattle and cows
B	yeah
A	yeah but the legislation has gone up a lot because of the foot and mouth that broke out in the country about four or five years ago
B	oh yeah that destroyed a lot of things didn't it
A	that destroyed a lot of stuff
B	a lot of shows were cancelled weren't they
A	they were all cancelled yeah and now because of that they have to they have to be well we had to have movement books anyway didn't we
B	yes
A	just
B	anyone who keeps livestock will have to have movement books
A	yeah but that's that's more dense now if you like that's more sort of er strict it's a lot stricter now
B	yeah
A	everything has to be ear tagged
B	it was just coming in wasn't it
A	it was then coming in then yeah
B	mm I think if we'd kept going much more
A	yeah we'd have to be ear tagged
B	yeah we'd all be tagged
A	well you wouldn't have had to be ear tagged or me but the goats would
B	yeah okay
A	anyway I think we better get on hadn't we?
B	yep okay
A	otherwise the day will be gone
B	yep we'll get on
