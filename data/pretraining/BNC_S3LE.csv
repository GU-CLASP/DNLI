D	yeah
B	I don't blame you
D	Saudi Arabia is one of those places as well that's wouldn't mind going there

D	yeah
B	what you mean because you know
D	you
B	the oppression of women and
A	do you mean it's shit?
D	no it's not
A	it is
C	it's a desert it's not
D	so?
C	it's not like
D	it's one of those places that you can say I've been there and I've worked there
C	it's not Dubai or erm
A	the reason why they pay you well is because
C	yeah
A	it's crap
D	it's cool
B	you haven't really had much chance to travel though have you I suppose?
D	no
C	it's it's not like Abu Dhabi or anything like Saudi Arabia I mean I mean erm Dubai Saudi Arabia
C	is just like strict and desert and
A	and they still they still chop people's heads off
C	heads off yeah
A	in the street
D	yeah that's we can go and watch one one night can't we?
A	apparently if you you don't wanna ever be anywhere near them erm when you're it's normally it's normally on a Friday after they do prayer on a Friday it's their Friday is our Saturday and they all go a bit mad after prayer on the Friday afternoon and they come out of prayer that's when they have these public public displays of discipline
C	yeah
A	so westerners westerners just stay stay well away because apparently like
C	your hand chopped off yeah
A	your hand chopped off
C	yeah
A	so if you're if you're anywhere anywhere near all of sudden there'll be a lot of the people who are behind you pushing you to the front even if you don't wanna be there
C	name and shame yeah
A	you get you'll get pushed to the front and you have to witness this beheading or
B	it sends chills I
A	so people just yeah
C	stay away yeah
A	obviously the guys that are there that are running it they just know the places not to be and the times not not to be there
C	there was something on erm it was the Daily Mail but like the stories seem pretty true obviously slightly different it's it's Isis doing it but they chucked some guy off a erm off like a tower block and he didn't die from it so they went and and they started stoning him to death after he's survived that fall and it's just like it's that's pretty brutal
A	they put
C	yeah
A	some guy in a cage and set him on fire
C	yeah
A	it's er in Jordan
C	that's nuts
D	or if but it was a a
A	was that a
D	a pilot a pilot from Jordan
A	Jordanian pilot
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	he was probably he was probably trained by the air force as well
C	I reckon
A	cos they come over the Jordanian the Jordanian the young Jordanian guys
C	what they're er yeah
A	come to Cranwell and er well just learn to to learn how to fly and once they qualify as a fast jet pilot
A	they go back and fly in Jordan
C	really?
A	cos we've got this got this service agreement with the Jordanians like
C	yeah
A	so that guy was probably taught by us to fly and he'll he'll come from a really wealthy Jordanian family
C	yeah
D	you're going back there to do the same job as you're doing at at that you're doing at
A	more or less yeah
D	so that'll be supplies won't it?
A	yeah
D	which is what like a just organising everything?
A	you say just
A	there's no just to it
A	there's no just you haven't gotta

C	Tesco?
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	and and and at the and that job in Spain
A	I think you need to
D	so even if it's just like a shit
A	what you'll have to do
D	a shitty warehouse job I don't care
A	what you'll have to do is probably er sort out a good CV
D	yeah
A	for Saudi jobs
C	that'll be such a shock to your system though
D	it'll be good though
A	like
D	doing it

A	and you've got a little
B	that's crazy
C	so everything you make is just you don't need to spend anything you don't need to
D	and what is there to do
C	yeah
D	in like social time?
D	nothing
C	so what would you
D	there's literally nothing to do
A	well it's a dry country there's there's no ale
D	right
B	they make hooch in the camp
A	oh yeah they make
B	so they
A	they make their own hooch
D	I bet it's pretty strong stuff as well innit?
A	the I'll let you know
A	I've heard about it but I've not been able to taste it if you get caught like that's a
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's just like
D	is it is it British law on the camp as well?
A	I think more or less I think so so it's
C	yeah you don't want your hand chopped off do you?
A	well there's all the all the top execs that I
C	yeah
A	so it's not like it's it's

D	to do in like social times do you know what I mean? there must be places to go to to do stuff
B	you there's a there'll be a gym and a pool and all that sort of stuff
A	that's all on on the camp
D	right yeah
A	yeah there's a couple of pools and there's a there's a gym
D	yeah
A	there's a cinema and all that kind of stuff off off-base you wouldn't wanna be doing anything apart from if it's it's
C	yeah
A	that's it and shopping
C	yeah
A	could because Riyadh's the capital it's just like going to
B	yeah
A	I suppose just different rules everything shuts down on a regular basis cos it cos they pray like
B	prayers yeah
A	they pray like five times a day
A	but then but then cos they shut at all weird times during the day they stay open till like midnight so like you can get a their version of
C	yeah yeah
A	they've got
C	it'll be like fuck me be no pork or anything there's no
A	no they don't do pork
C	pork no
B	no bacon
A	there's no pork and no booze that's it
C	yeah
D	I wonder why that it how they why they've adopted that over the years?
B	it's all religious
D	yeah it's like pork
C	cos
D	pork yeah
C	erm pigs are seen as dirty animals
D	aren't they maybe
C	choose
D	aren't they maybe really meant to be like one of the most hygienic?
C	yeah but they're always seen as like you chuck in your waste and they eat that so Jews and Muslims don't eat pork erm Hindus don't eat beef cos
B	cows are sacred
C	cows are sacred erm I don't know anything else er Buddhists don't eat meat because animals are living
B	god's creatures
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah it's weird
D	so they're vegetarian
B	a lot of Hindus are vegetarian so
B	yeah as well yeah
B	like erm a lot of like Indian dishes are traditionally vegetarian
D	yeah
B	the only reason a chicken curry has chicken in is because we put it
C	potato
B	yeah potato
C	yeah most of the most of the laws from like like religious laws are just what was was done in the day someone wrote it down and then
D	is that is that like sharia law?
C	apparently
D	the out in Saudi Arabia then? is that what it is?
A	is it what?
C	sharia law
D	sharia law? is it
C	that that's like
D	that's like the
C	beyond beyond like
B	that's
C	pick and choose
B	yeah
C	that's that's the extreme side
B	that's that's that that's
D	that's like the extremists really
B	what the extremist believes yeah
C	they're still killing people
B	oh yes
C	oh yes
D	and it's never gonna stop
B	no
A	if anything it's gonna
B	yeah
C	no it's
D	er it's not there's not there isn't exactly world peace now though is there? there's
B	or Kim Jong-un or whatever his name is
A	the thing is there there is is
B	all it takes is for one day him to go fuck it
A	you know the Americans and the Russians and the
D	they're like they're
A	yeah yeah
D	and like erm er
A	yeah
D	so it's like they're trying they're trying to er they're trying to get everyone to start fighting aren't they?
C	he can't do
B	I know he can't but
C	he's got rockets
B	yeah but that's what I mean like it would be it would be him one day going fuck it and just like thinking like like I want to try and assert some sort of power
C	it's South Korea is I think
B	no
C	and those rockets would be shit like obviously a few would get through but I don't think it could really go anywhere and I think their only real er
B	yeah but
C	only ally
B	yeah
C	and targets
B	and and huge and wealthy
C	yeah
B	like I
C	they go one way they are against America and they're trying not to do that gonna back them up
B	yeah
C	and their real enemy is China or they can
A	any more noises? any attic noises?
C	no no that's
B	no it's
C	all fixed
A	all gone?
C	it's good
B	it's been a quiet week thankfully
D	you're not saying that your brand new house is haunted?
C	no no
B	well you know it was really really windy like stupidly windy on Saturday night? like we literally had the like probably like the most sleepless night I think I've had in a long time like there was just these huge bangs coming from the loft and I was like like but we didn't actually to be fair during the night we weren't a hundred percent sure where the noise was coming from like as
C	I was up twice
B	yeah
C	checking on the gate checking on things outside and there was banging all night and like we weren't sleeping erm
B	so I told dad
C	yeah
B	to come round the next day with the ladder so we could investigate
B	it turns out all it was was like
C	well it's
D	what and it was like rattling around?
B	yeah
C	no I think it's the the tube that the gas goes up so it's a tube about that fat that weighs nothing it's like it it weighed absolutely nothing did it? so as soon as
A	it was polystyrene really
C	a gust of wind came erm we're really insulated between our house and the roof but the roof's not that insulated so the wind would blow through the roof bang it a few times
B	against all the beams and stuff
C	just just above our bed
B	which obviously sounds really loud when you're right beneath it
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah
C	it was so loud horrible wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	what you need is on a windy windy day like super-windy
C	yeah
B	to see if it works
A	and then just see if it er
B	if they ended up wedging it didn't you?
C	yeah
A	so we wedged it
B	but yeah no it's been quiet
D	so it's actually windy in your loft?
B	it was really windy yeah
C	there's vents in there so it goes straight through
B	yeah
C	but you know on the sheet on the inside? that was all blown about
A	is that a new phone then?
D	yeah
B	hopefully a little bit more hardstanding than some of your old phones
D	yeah
A	why don't why don't you get a cover for it?
D	er?
A	why don't you get a cover for it?
D	I need to get a case really cos I like have it in my pocket and er it's gonna get broken soon
A	well my case is as naff as anything
D	they only cost like five or ten quid don't they?
C	yeah
B	yeah especially Ebay or whatever
A	at least you can drop it and if you drop it you're gonna be fine aren't you?
D	yeah I need to get one of those indestructible ones
B	my my phone
D	you
B	my phone is indestructible
D	flat down?
B	flat down and it didn't smash
D	no way

C	yeah
A	you can drop it from just here and if it
C	just
A	it lands on the wrong spot
B	oh yeah and just our friend
A	where the back is part of the cover so
D	yeah and you can get like a battery case as well have you seen those?
A	yeah you can get
D	so you get like double battery life
A	like twenty quid
B	have a look in Ebay
D	I just had like those they're good for like
B	yeah
D	holding it and everything but I don't like them cases
B	yeah they're quite annoying
A	well I would have had a better one if they'd done but they don't do them
B	yeah just have a look on Ebay see what you like
A	I think I'm gonna struggle with cases for that I need to be on like Amazon or something to buy one
B	yeah

B	you're ancient now
D	yeah I used to I used to know everyone didn't I? and now I'm just just a relic
A	didn't one of your friends used to work here?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah she gets married next year you know
D	I reckon I probably see more of your mates than you see of your mates though
B	probably
D	weirdly
B	probably
D	yeah
B	especially like the
D	just because you're never out
B	no I never go out although they don't go out as much as they used to
C	saw a lot of
B	so er
D	she still snapchats me sometimes
B	yeah I really can't work out what she's been doing she she drops me a text message every now again it's just a bit weird
D	what have you just like given up on her now?
B	a little bit in as much as like I I feel like I did as much as I can but
D	you need to let her get on with what she wants to do
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	you have to let people help themselves
D	when you're younger as well you have more time for your friends don't you? and then you get busier when you're older don't you?
B	if if I honestly like if she needed my help I'd be there but like I offered her a lot of help last year and like
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah erm for a while everybody thought she was like bipolar erm she started having like a few mental problems erm so like she'd have these periods of being like super-high on life and like doing like just outrageous things like she'd go to London and blow like three grand on her credit card like buying like bottles of Moët and like staying in expensive hotels and then but you'd be like like like what even is that? and then she'd come home broke and like crash because like I dunno like she
D	all her money had gone
B	yeah and like because I dunno the realisation that like you know that's not her life like
D	yeah
B	I dunno like she was always like chasing this like extreme version of her life like she always wanted to be
D	yeah
B	but that's not life you can't live your entire life being that person like
D	yeah
B	and like so she'd go she'd go through these like months of being like really high and all over the place and just doing like outrageous ridiculous things and then she'd kind of crash completely and go completely in herself
A	yeah yeah
B	and wouldn't talk to anyone and would be feeling like really low and really down
A	yeah
B	it's like I mean major extremes like
D	bloody hell
B	and like I witnessed it for a couple of years and didn't like was there when she needed me but it's really hard to be
A	oh no yeah
B	like that because
A	it is
B	like
D	yeah
B	you know when when she was feeling high I wasn't fun enough for her and then when she's feeling low she doesn't wanna talk to anyone so it took a lot for her to like ever make contact with me she had to be she had to be feeling fairly normal basically
D	yeah
B	to make any contact with me but then even like I had me and
A	mm mm mm
B	yeah
D	soon as you said that dad was just like
B	yeah like and like you're listening to her like and you know she's telling me like she text me
D	yeah
B	I've got a new boyfriend right tell me about him oh well I've only met him two days ago
A	David Beckham
B	but like you know like no he's not your boyfriend then if you've met him two days ago oh well I've just got a new like the best one she told me she she'd just got this new job in London and like she packed her bags and moved down to London and then as far as I could tell she was essentially like crashing at some guy's place who like she'd just met and then like going out to like London coffee places and just like talking to random people
A	it's really sad isn't it?
B	it is really sad and like as her friend like it's really really difficult cos you'd sit and talk to her
unknown_female	how was everything with the starters? alright for everything? shall I get
C	could I have some ketchup please?
A	cos at your do she
B	yeah she was fine and I and I I mean it was
A	probably one of the
C	stories something to talk about
B	yeah she enjoyed
A	bit like
B	yeah she enjoyed being that person and then what seemed to happen is that as everybody got a bit older and everybody's attention shifted she really struggled to deal with like what was like normal life like it almost just wasn't interesting enough for her
D	too boring
B	yeah and she really struggled to deal with that and it was really weird and like like I said there was periods where I knew she was really low but there's nothing you can do about it except be there when she wants you to talk to her
D	I know but you can you can feel that way but just not for a prolonged period of time like hers do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
D	like everyone gets that feeling where you don't sort of think that everything was
B	yeah
D	what you thought it would be do you know what I mean?
B	exactly
D	like
B	but it was just
D	yeah yeah
B	but like no like but hers were just so like I mean when she was low she was like manic depressive low like she was she was hurting herself and just getting herself into really bad situations and then like I mean and she was like kicking off at her parents and she was being
D	right what and she was writing about it?
B	and she was writing about it yeah for like public kind of consumption but like everybody who was around her at the time that she was claiming this happened basically turned round and said like like I'd be really sad if it was true I just don't see how it could be because you know like he like he's just A he wasn't that kind of person and B she had so many people who were around her at that phase of her life that they would have noticed
D	yeah
B	and so like all she was doing is like trying to be like it was defamation of character like so he ended up having to call her parents threatening to call the police actually if basically cos she was just the kind of stuff she was saying it was so
D	so bad so yeah
B	yeah it was terrible and so her parents kicked off but like you know her parents keep shipping her off to like various family members for like weeks at a time and it's just they clearly as a family just don't know how to
C	can't cope
B	deal with it yeah
A	must be a nightmare
B	it's really strange like she's as far as she can tell she's in her final year at uni now but it's taken her like six seven years to do a three-year course because like she'll get halfway through a year and then
D	it's a bit of a shame isn't it?
B	it is such a shame and it's really sad cos you can't but the thing is it it it is I I go out of my way not to ignore her but I just don't get I don't make the first contact with her because
C	cos you can't entertain her
B	no and I mean dad she sends me poems and stuff like all the time like
B	what am I meant to say to this? like
A	what has she actually made this stuff up?
B	yeah she's
B	this is
C	she's still out to shock
B	yeah and she like
C	you can't entertain her
B	everything she does is just like it's for the shock factor and it's just like it's really hard work so I just stay out of it the last time I spoke to her she was doing well at uni she told me she might move to Canada when she finishes
A	what's she doing at uni?
B	erm I think she's doing English literature she was doing international relations at first but then she swapped so I think she's doing English lit but
unknown_female	you all done with your starter here?
C	cheers thanks yeah
B	I'm pretty good
D	cheers that was good cheers
A	yeah it was good
B	I haven't even I haven't really I haven't told her where I live now or anything cos like she went through a period of just turning up at my house and I mean like
A	what your house in?
B	yeah she's turned
C	no
B	in
C	yeah
B	yeah she's turned up before and I've not been in and she's bent mum's ear for an hour
A	well that's
B	that she was gonna put on at the rugby club in
D	what and then nothing ever happened?
C	nothing ever happens
A	just a fantasist
B	it's really weird really weird and then like after all that like for years and years and years she was going back and forth to the doctors they they were really struggling to diagnose anything I mean I know it's hard to diagnose the mental stuff anyway but then in the end she was like oh well they just said that you know erm it's just psychotic behaviour brought on by an overuse of drink and drugs
D	yeah
B	like you can't help but feel sorry for someone who's bipolar and then can't really control it if someone tells you oh you know
A	that'll be
D	but in a way that's caused her to
B	oh yeah
D	having bipolar personality
B	it's just it's so hard to keep up it's tiring like the last time me and
D	why would
B	I dunno but she was convinced that
D	yeah
B	friend erm friend loosely not friends anymore mainly because of everything that happened erm
C	but you can't blame you
B	they've got their own problems erm so they and they by no means they're not healthy for each other like as much as
A	you've gotta question your friends haven't you? you've gotta question your friends if er
B	it's just like not me in the slightest and as much as I wanna be there and support her like I can't when I don't really understand any of it
A	it's not normal behaviour is it?
B	no and the thing is also like her parents never really reached out like if I was her parents like I would literally have wanted to make contact with anybody that I thought could help
B	and they didn't
A	they probably
C	don't worry about it don't get your knickers in a twist
B	would you like to change the conversation is that what you're saying?
C	oh yeah
B	you do this all the time it's really rude and it annoys me you get bored of the conversation and so you just start taking the mick
C	I'm not it's not
B	it's my
C	it's not rude
B	she's one of my best friends like if I wanna
B	talk about it I'm gonna talk about it
C	I know
C	I know
B	no
B	no
C	I guess I wanted to go but no
A	eh?
C	it's annoying to go after her and I'll
D	does she
C	I'll wait a little while
D	does she do that for for the shock factor yeah?
C	yeah
A	no she
C	yeah yeah I know
A	a
C	I know it's it's an awkward position to be in definitely
D	yeah
C	yeah I think so alright
C	this definitely should be me doing that
A	eh?
C	no I'll go out to her
A	no
C	you sure?
A	yeah I want to go
A	I
C	no
D	no no remind me not to
C	it was that moment you know you know when you're at school and you look at someone and then you just like kind of
C	get the giggles?
D	you'd both be like you're both thinking the same thing
C	the same thing
D	I was thinking like we've been talking about
C	yeah
unknown_female	you alright for drinks there?
D	er
A	can I have another one please?
unknown_female	another one of those? yeah
unknown_female	yeah no problem yeah
C	yeah I it wasn't it wasn't that I I wasn't liking the conversation I just thought like this
C	her chest
D	pretty
C	and that's why I looked at you just to say like
C	this is intense
D	she always thinks people are taking the piss out of her when really it's just like a
C	it was it was a
D	she I mean she struggles she struggles to have a have a laugh sometimes
C	no she can laugh but it's more of a
D	she's like that she's like twenty-five dad doesn't need to be er rescuing
C	no
D	her from the toilet
C	no don't worry she erm she set out set off from home at like half six today she didn't get to work till half eight and then on the way back she had like a two-hour journey as well so she's
D	four hours in the car
C	yeah so she's had a shit day she had to give like a presentation at work to a load of people who are like absolute boffins and know their stuff so she was worried about that as well so
D	did it go well?
C	as far as I can tell yeah she's she was she seemed to be buzzing afterwards about like she'd been pushed out of her
D	yeah yeah
C	erm so
C	shouldn't need to and right I'm very much of the attitude of like
D	that's what you get when you get brought up round
C	just just chill
D	like round my around my mum though she she's a constant worrier
C	yeah and I'm so is my mum to be honest I've like got the attitude of just chill out
D	yeah
C	don't

A	oh yeah
D	I remember
B	yeah
D	you stole 50 P off someone and er
B	I stole someone's pocket money
C	why did you
C	why did you do that?
B	I
C	what's wrong with you?
B	I think I got so scared I came straight back and told mum that I stole it and then she had to have this awkward conversation like
B	erm but yeah like I used to well you know about my sleeping and I used to just get up and
C	just do stuff yeah
B	yeah I used to
C	you'd sort of pass out
B	they put me to bed and then I'd be up like ten minutes later
A	have you seen the film Carrie?
C	no
A	Carrie have you not see it?
C	yeah
A	one of the only nights where she wouldn't do it
D	no
A	cos
A	every other night every other night
A	and like night after night after night and then one of us would take her back to her room lay her down stay with her for an eternity
A	and then tiptoe out the door
A	he'd be flat out in
D	I was literally like they you used to take me up didn't you? erm when you were watching Coronation Street and then by the end of the programme I would already be asleep
A	he was straight straight asleep no problem
B	mum's admitted now obviously I didn't really realise when I was younger but erm they used to when it got to a point where they didn't
A	she'd be on the
B	yeah
A	she would be
A	and I felt
D	let me out
A	I mean I've never felt so shit in all my life it was
C	yeah
A	shouldn't be doing this and then you'd go in and put you know lay her down in bed and
C	bullying yeah

B	you have to teach kids to self-
C	well there's self-soothing

C	and then there's
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	no I I remember waking up at night and like going through to mum and dad's just like I'm awake like I can't sleep
B	well I was forever trying to get in their bed and you know I can't sleep I want to sleep with you
C	yeah I'd I'd do that a bit
B	but I also think like in in my defence I think it was a weird stage in my life in that like we'd I was kind of conscious enough to understand that we'd moved and that we'd moved somewhere that was foreign and that I didn't quite like feel safe in and I think I wouldn't be surprised if that was a major cos it was when we were in Germany

A	lovely
unknown_female	I'll leave that with you
B	thank you yeah erm work sent me to Germany like in May for a conference but they were doing it on the cheap so they erm they booked me flights that went from different airports so I flew from Stansted to Dusseldorf Weeze or wherever
A	yeah
B	and then I had to get a one-hour coach from there to Dusseldorf where the conference was and then when I flew home I was
B	I can't I can't speak any German I get to the conference the conference is fine and then they've given me the address of this like B and B so I get into a taxi and I'm like oh
A	take me there
B	this this is the address and he's going oh I
B	thinking like
A	I can't be staying here
B	yeah literally so he drops me off
D	so is this your work they like stitched you up and got it
B	yeah
D	cheapo?
B	massively stitched me up
B	so like
D	yeah
B	and no not even like proper shops or anything
A	yeah yeah
B	so I'm walking to this
A	a lot of Germany's like that
B	yeah and I walked into this restaurant and like I just
A	a customer
B	was just like
A	what?
B	why English lady? why do you want just a table for one? like why
A	yeah
B	and like I've never I actually got treated really well cos they obviously felt very sorry for me so I've never eaten so much food in my life like I ordered what did I I order?
C	spag bol wasn't it?
B	yeah and it was just like this like gigantic bowl that would feed like four people so I ate really well but then I had this like awkward walk back where I'm thinking like woah this is this is quite scary like it if if anybody if anybody was to like if anybody
C	notice you
B	if anybody was to like even take me now nobody would know because
A	yeah
B	the other thing was work hadn't given me a work phone so I had no point of contact and I didn't realise that you know like with some networks if you go abroad it just automatically puts you on a like a
D	yeah yeah
B	a foreign network?
B	well with Three you have to tell them that you're going abroad for that
D	otherwise they cancel your service
B	they just cancelled it so I had no I had no phone service so I'm walking around in the middle of Germany on my own with no form of contact whatsoever I've never been so scared in my entire life I literally like I've I've walked at such a pace to get back to my B and B and I shut the door and I didn't leave again like until the next morning when I was all packed up and ready to go and I rang down and asked for a taxi and I was like
C	couldn't you Skype? there's no wi-fi there?
B	there's no
A	to be fair Germany is one of the safest places one of the safest countries
C	cos they're all too busy being efficient aren't they?
A	and if you remember being kids in Bavaria where you could just
B	yeah
A	kids just go to school by themselves
C	it's like being here in the fifties or something
A	er it was
A	and there's just no there's hardly the they there's not a lot of crime at all
C	yeah
A	it is definitely one of the
C	yeah
A	I've never seen so many kids
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	with not a care in the world and that was commonplace when
B	it's just it's just quite an intimidating situation
A	oh yeah it can be
B	to be in like especially like I think I'd have felt better if I was a bit more competent
A	but the
B	but knowing knowing that I couldn't speak a lot of German I knew I I knew I would struggle if someone did stop me I wouldn't necessarily know what they were trying to say to me or
C	what about the erm

B	oh it's just like
C	and the on the taxi on the way back
B	yeah the next morning I
B	sorry and then I was just sat in the back of the taxi thinking I've really annoyed my taxi driver
B	he could take me anywhere
D	when me
C	beep beep
D	opened the window saying you want a lift?
D	then we were like we all like put our our stuff in his car and he took us there and he was it was cheap as chips but he was like he was driving like a nutter
D	literally driving like an absolutely nutter
A	just hit lucky that you guys were
D	yeah paid him like fifteen euro the trip from the airport Amsterdam city centre is actually longer than you think it's about twenty-five minutes twenty minutes
B	got yourself a bargain there then
A	when I was working when I was working in Bosnia
C	mm
A	at all the different military bases
C	yeah
A	this place nothing
A	so he said you'll have to go into the local town
D	what in Bosnia?
A	yeah
A	so
B	right
A	we got a car that looks like a police car it's got
C	yeah
A	yeah every single room is empty
D	yeah
A	so we must have had probably the two best rooms of the hotel
A	there's water everywhere
D	I bet all I bet you were like had a fucking good laugh there though didn't you?
A	the hotel was just like shot to bits talk about Fawlty Towers
A	of course we're starving so I get my rifle and I put it and I put it in my bed and hid all my stuff locked my door and I remember walking
C	mm
A	you know
C	yeah
A	it's the same there
C	mm
A	so we're walking down
A	just trying to find we found a restaurant talk about standing out we just stood out
A	like
C	a sore thumb yeah
A	I thought when when we get back to the hotel the car's gonna be trashed er
C	someone's stolen your gun
D	yeah
A	my my weapon's probably gone all my gear's probably gone
B	yeah
A	and that was like I didn't sleep at all that night
C	no
A	I was just waiting for somebody to come through the door
D	so just sat there with your rifle
A	middle of a war zone
A	in like a
D	was it one of those places like er they don't take fondly to military and?
A	they
D	wake the fucker
A	what's that all about?
A	but yeah that was er that was one of those experiences we've all had them
B	they're character building
A	the old the old like what am I doing here?
C	how am I here?
B	like it was weird though
C	mm
B	cos like even like that night when I was in Germany like I felt totally overwhelmed in as much as like it had been a
A	thing is you were left
B	I'd love to go back to Germany
A	to be all on your own and to be left to your own devices on your own it's not fun
C	no
A	you you you can't do that to people doesn't matter how especially somebody your age
B	that I really did feel my age as well
D	to survive off their own back you're not travelling you're there for a for a job aren't you?
B	yeah like you know
A	probably
B	yeah
A	were probably there in twos and threes
B	exactly
A	and there was you on your
C	and have accommodation next to next to it
A	yeah
B	yeah you'd
C	not somewhere in a village
B	and like it was also it was also the fact that you know like if I went like if I went away with work now there's so many forms I'd have to fill in and they'd want a copy of my itinerary they'd wanna know where I was planning to be and when I was planning to be there so that if they ever
D	did you like to speak to the person who had planned your your travel that weekend then?
B	well the thing is I planned most of it I just I didn't plan the accommodation because when I originally looked I said oh it might not be worth it because I can't find any accommodation less than I think it was like a hundred and fifty pound for like one night erm and then like
C	didn't they spend more on like getting you there in taxis and stuff? wouldn't it have worked out the same if they'd put you somewhere close by?
D	cos you have to fork out for all your buses and
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	everything like that?
B	well I erm
C	you had to pay for it and they paid you pack
B	yeah although I think she actually gave me a float
B	I think
A	did any of your previous German speaking come did you remember any of it?
B	erm some of it I tend to just say like
A	well there you go
B	and
B	and then they go oh okay
A	yeah
B	and they can tell that you're trying
D	what what's that?
B	no
A	I only speak I I only speak a little German and and that means that's about all
A	don't ask
B	I can I can I can give directions like
D	what's
B	around the corner
D	around the corner
B	erm and so I can do the important stuff I can order food and I can order drinks
A	that's
B	I could
A	when we lived in
A	when we lived in
C	yeah yeah
A	we had er birthday parties for these two the house would be full of Bavarian kids
C	yeah German kids
A	these these two they'd be there all this in Bavarian and they'd talk to me all or or call me in perfect English
A	and everything and if they were outside in the garden and the next door neighbours were out in their garden they'd talk over the fence in perfect Bavarian to her and then if they spoke to me I didn't understand a
A	and then
C	she's yeah
A	she's quite good she's not not great
C	yeah
A	but then on the way home like on the way home from the supermarket
B	mum said she used to get annoyed cos like
B	she was obviously trying to practise her German as well
B	but I'd always butt in and be like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
D	yeah
A	and you were pretty good as well
D	what at German?
A	yeah yeah
B	she was saying mum told me that erm when I started big school like one of the first reports I got back was that I was the best
A	German German leader
B	I was the best leader in class I was the only English kid like I was the best German leader
A	she was the best
A	the best
B	that's where it started
B	if I I honestly think if I if I actually went back and lived there again even if it was for a year I think I'd stand a good chance of picking it up
A	yeah
B	it's there somewhere isn't it?
A	you had your own pals you you were playing football and stuff talking to
B	I remember going on the on the football tour
A	you both you both went on the football tour with the Bavarian kids talking Bavarian the whole time
B	I played football then
A	there was nothing
D	really?
A	the first two or three months they hated it
B	it's like speaking to Martians you didn't have a fucking clue what they were
A	they were treated like they
A	they were treated like the
C	stupid kids
A	yeah the crazy kids
C	yeah
A	then six months later couldn't they couldn't get there fast enough
C	well it does sound like their kindergarten and their their like reception and year one and stuff sounds fun so
A	well they don't start school till they're six
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	and then we took her over there and she's back into kindergarten
C	yeah
A	so she hated it I wanna be in school I don't wanna be doing this drawing and painting and playing I wanna do some learning
C	yeah
A	and the Germans don't start until they're six and
B	they have really weird like learning hours as well like they
C	two
B	yeah
A	oh yeah you did yeah
B	English
A	yeah
B	kind of after school club
A	it was
B	type thing
A	yeah it was it was an English class wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	talk
D	when we went to erm Mexico one of the days that the all four of us went to the er this Mexican guy on the beach it was a bit
B	Spanish
D	well yeah
D	Spanish
D	for like two for like two minutes right
D	and I'd managed to like just pick up on a few a few random words and I was right so basically he says we can go on them it's like five hundred pesos but we have to wait half an hour because there's some
A	how did you do that?
C	what the fuck?
D	I was like yeah well
B	yeah
D	forgot to tell you that I'm fluent Spanish
D	yeah
C	in half an hour?

D	Yamaha two fifty erm Jet Skis and
C	never been on a Jet Ski yeah
D	it's so weird that was the first time I'd ever been on a Jet Ski
A	they're not easy to do
D	no they're not when you're going full pelt and you keep slapping against the waves
A	they're not easy to drive at all
D	you've gotta keep you've gotta keep control
A	and the more the faster you go the
D	yeah and you've got to really lean back haven't you? so you just like skip over the
A	if you if you try and go slow
A	they're really hideous to control
D	oh yeah
A	but if you get a bit a bit of speed up behind you
D	because
C	no no you just float you float on top
D	and then you just smack into the next one
C	yeah
D	and then you er accelerate a bit more and then you just jump off that wave and smack into the next one you can't build any speed up you've got to like lean back on it
A	and you've just got
D	and just
A	no when you do turn you wanna turn slowly cos
C	yeah
A	if you turn like a pushbike turn the thing just goes
D	have you seen those have you seen those suits that they wear now and they go in and out of the water like a dolphins?
C	yeah
A	oh yeah yeah
D	yeah they had those on the beach on Mexico as well
A	that's the
D	the guys that was obviously more expensive to do and there there was a guy just always out on it just showing it off kind of thing trying to get people in
C	wouldn't mind doing Jet Skis and
D	did the quad biking through the jungle did er
C	quad biking's fun
D	zip lining through through the forest
A	zip lining?
C	mm
D	and then cave jumping
C	oh into the pools?
D	they they had like erm they're called something and they're like er holes in the ground and they've got
B	springs
A	sinkholes?
D	they're
C	so a rock around the outside?
D	yeah
C	yeah yeah
D	and er they all connect to each other underneath basically
C	and they're all caves and stuff
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	and er the first one was like six metres it was just a hole a hole in the rock with a little wooden plank across it and then the guy like we all walked there through the jungle and they let the guy that was like giving the tour the little Mexican dude like he's like run off ahead to like hide in the bush and he could do like monkey noises and things like that
D	so he'd like rattle the tree and he'd be like
D	to like scare you
D	and then we got to this like hole in the ground and it was just a plank of wood across it and he was like right everyone one by one just like jump in and it's just a pitch black hole and you can't see anything but if you carefully look like you see the sunlight shimmer
D	erm yeah and you just jumped in and er they had like a big wooden er a wooden like structure it looked like the it had like steps going back up to the top so once you jumped in you could get out and then go back up and jump in again and they had like zip lines in the caves going across and like
B	that's cool
D	canoes and
D	and floats and boards and everything like that and there's bats in there as well and then we went to the next one and that was like a pallet up a tree basically and that was like ten metres and then there was like another pallet above that and it was like thirteen metres
A	what jumping into water?
D	yeah just jumping into like these caves with fresh water in it the second one was pretty
B	that's cool
D	and it was good cos I er like you we all got on the quads at the start of the er at the start of the like trek kind of thing and er all the quad bikes were in like er four rows and I got on the er I got on the first quad bike on the row on the right and it just so happens that that was like he led them out from there so I was the first quad bike behind the leader and then er the rest of the lads were like back here

C	yeah erm and he's had to go round and ask people for money before he's done it because they have to put a down payment on it and it's like sports hall hire or stuff like that
B	yeah
C	just to make sure that they they're good for it because people have been quite like
unknown_female	there we are
C	cheers
unknown_female	is everything okay with your desserts? yeah?
C	yeah it's a good one thanks
unknown_female	oh good
C	got quite obnoxious about the fact that he's asked for money upfront just like you'll no it's still gonna go to charity you can see why he needs to do it
B	yeah but I'd also be like don't commit to doing something if you can't afford to pay for it like the whole point of raising money cos otherwise that means the money he's raising isn't actually going to raise money it's going to pay for him to raise money that doesn't really make sense
C	they've had
A	I do
D	I was in fact going to watch it
B	I wasn't
D	by the sounds of things we're now drawing sixteen eight at halftime
A	what in Ireland's favour? no
D	sixteen eight to Wales now after that cheer I would have thought they would have just scored a try
B	these are really nice actually I've not had one of these that doesn't feel sickly this doesn't feel quite as sickly as some of the other ones
A	quite nice
B	mm
D	mm for some reason I was erm like er chocolate orange isn't as sickly as like just a normal chocolate
B	mm
D	brownie is it?
A	what?
D	those er those orange things there
A	oh yeah
A	mm
D	probably mistaken for syphilis
D	yeah me and er me and
B	no
D	I get can get four weeks working next week and do it that way so we're gonna go out on the Friday night then go out and do some shopping on the Saturday
B	yeah
D	go out for some food and
B	that'll be good
D	and then just chill out on a Sunday morning before driving back and I wanna like I wanna take enough money so you can do what you wanna do
B	you can actually enjoy it yeah
D	instead of being like restricted do you know what I mean? but when the weather's like this you're only getting like two or three days' work a week
B	yeah
D	and you've gotta pay mum the rent and your petrol and everything like that it's impossible to to save any money
B	yeah
D	so I'm just praying that I get five days next week so I can actually have some money to take with me
B	yeah that's yeah
D	otherwise there's no point in fucking going
C	will you work longer hours in the summer do you reckon?
D	I've asked him
D	but he says he's got nothing for me that I can do
C	yeah
D	we're starting his extension on Monday he's er doing an extension on his own house so we're gonna start that on Monday because he's got jobs he's got jobs that he's priced up and quotes for but the customers don't wanna do them like so it's all just waiting to be done it's never normally like this it normally just runs like one job into the next
B	I was gonna say er I don't think it's obviously not a reflection on you it's to do with the fact that the the work's not there
D	obviously when the when the weather's shit as well they're bad enough organise organising the different jobs and the materials when the weather's good
B	yeah
D	but then when you have days where you don't even do anything then you've got to
B	yeah
D	especially if you're relying on deliveries or things to be dropped off and like but
C	so what
D	he's got loads of remote control planes and he flies para
C	really?
D	which is basically a
C	yeah
D	and you start the engine up
C	and then yeah
D	it's only like it's only like seventy-five a seventy-five er CC engine
C	just enough yeah
D	and it's just you only you only need the engine to take off
C	yeah
D	and you run along yank the cord and it pushes you up then once you're once you're in the air but you'd use it and you just lean back and then the engine like takes you up and then as soon as you're up there you just like cut it out and just float around and it's
C	that sounds pretty
D	yeah
D	but they can go up to like five thousand feet
C	really?
D	yeah
C	up there
D	it is
C	like go miles
D	he's so he's so
unknown_female	is everything okay for you?
B	lovely thank you
C	yeah it was nice
D	yeah it was brilliant
unknown_female	yeah you see why I always recommend that
unknown_female	cos I love it
B	thank you very much
D	this er
unknown_female	thank you
D	this paramotor that he's bought is bright orange like with a fan on the back of it it's a bright orange blade on it and it's er this wing's bright orange as well he's like I'm not getting hit
D	I'm not getting hit by any of these jets
C	that would be a way to go though wouldn't it?
D	he's got all the flight plans from round here though and there's like hardly anywhere that you can fly round here
A	yeah
D	so I don't think I don't think paramotoring would be very good to be doing round here but
C	so what do like
D	I've watched I've watched videos er
C	when er when it takes them
D	cos they go high enough don't they for for jets to fly into them?
B	mm
C	yeah
D	did you see that plane in
C	another one that another one crashed
D	the
C	I haven't seen the video no
D	I'm like Jesus it's on Facebook like the dashcam the er dashboard camera in someone's car they're going along like the freeway or the highway or whatever and you see the plane coming in from the top left of the screen
C	the one that crashed?
D	and it's like side it's like sideways on it's coming through the skyscrapers and then the
B	who just casually has a dashboard cam?
D	the
C	loads of people
D	they're no they're common yeah
C	they're really common everywhere
D	yeah in Russia especially
C	Russia er all over Asia America is getting really big South America it's really
B	well why?
D	I've seen one before where
B	what
C	insurance
D	yeah because erm
C	really big on insurance you can have them pointing at you and pointing at the road
D	I've seen
C	so if someone crashes into you like like that
D	I've seen one
C	it's
D	where a Russian have been driving down the road and er it goes on for a couple of minutes and then a lorry ends up coming past them the other way and it's carrying like a load of bricks on the back of it and it's got a sheet over it but then a loose brick like falls out of the truck at the exact moment that they're driving past and it goes straight through the windscreen and kills the mother that's driving the car and then all the family are like start screaming and it's like crazy
C	I've seen one in erm I think it was in Brazil er
D	but he just picks up his bike and like
C	no I think they obviously called the
C	called the police and ambulance
B	crazy
C	it's interesting
B	yeah

A	really?
B	yeah
A	does she go with
B	yeah there's a couple of them she hangs out with
A	the rugby club
B	the rugby club
A	I remember when she yeah she used to go
B	back in the day
A	back in the day is it still in the same place? cos obviously the the college has of kind of grown up around it hasn't it?
A	yeah
B	I think a lot of the girls I used to play with still play like play for the ladies
D	there's a new sixth form centre now
A	there's what?
D	there's there's a new sixth form centre
A	there's yeah
B	yeah
D	across the
A	it's changed a bit
B	I don't
A	it's changed a bit since
B	yeah
D	all of them big trees have been lopped down
C	I think they were a bit big for
D	the iconic trees
C	yeah
D	the rugby field trees
B	at
C	yeah
D	yeah if they if they go
B	if they fell the wrong way
D	if they got blown over those houses would would have been destroyed
A	what
D	all those big ones that run along the road
B	and they were like
C	the the the they're chopped half down halfway
B	yeah
D	and the orchard behind the AstroTurf has has gone now
A	and and and
D	yeah
D	old people's home now the house
B	is it?
A	is it?
D	I mean there's some new builds further on
B	there's loads of houses up there now
D	they all took they're all
B	yeah
D	I dunno
B	yeah ours isn't timber frame so we feel really smug about that like every time I see the new houses that the timber frame houses go up like ha ha ha
C	they're pretty much they're flatpack houses
B	yeah they're so crap like so many of my friends like who well I say so many like the friends that I know that have moved into like those kind of houses have so many problems like
C	huge cracks and
B	huge cracks like loads of settling like pins coming out like
C	skirting boards that don't fit doors
B	yeah
C	that don't fit
B	yeah doors that doors that warp like
D	it's because of the people that make the actual timber frames are like sixteen seventeen year year old like
B	but do you know what? like even on our site like the people I see walking around like I mean the site
C	young
B	the site managers are clearly like clued up they know exactly what they're doing but like Joe Bloggs who's doing the painting and
C	yeah
D	yeah idiot
B	and there's like there's some some of the bits like you know like we've got a radiator on the in the
D	well they do
B	get behind
D	yeah
B	so it but like
A	behind
B	and it just
C	so why wouldn't you do it first?
B	but why wouldn't yeah you?
C	or just paint the house and then do everything afterwards
B	you you'd paint the house and then you'd fix
C	and then then
B	the way the
C	touch it up if it needed it
A	no I know just cash
C	yeah
B	yeah they cut
C	it's terrible
B	they do cut corners in that respect
D	everything is just rushed isn't it?
C	yeah
B	but yeah
D	erm but they won't be they they won't be very that well organised where they've
C	no
D	got their houses going together like in stages
B	yeah
D	and then they have people going from one to one to one how it should be
B	problem being yeah well that's the thing the problem is the way they sell it is that they kind of like they they they they they release a batch of houses and then they'll put those
C	and they don't have painters onsite like
B	no
C	all the time so they have to get them in
D	yeah
B	yeah and like the like
C	so they rush a load
D	it's more money
C	of houses and they get them up yeah
B	windows and doors people only ever come in on a Friday for example and like the landscapers will only come in when there's a job to be done and stuff like that like and they obviously
C	yeah
B	have other contracts it's just it's like as a site manager it must be really difficult but yeah like the
C	I I can't really complain we've we've done
B	we've done really really well
B	and actually if if if all I can complain about is the painting
D	and you're gonna you that's all gonna be
B	I'm gonna redecorate anyway so
D	you're gonna so then yeah

B	yeah we've booked a hotel haven't we? for Friday night we're gonna go we wanna go to head Derby way do the Peaks on Saturday and just have a little walk
A	oh yeah
B	and stuff
C	just just to get out and about
A	yeah cos it's on Saturday innit?
C	we're a bit obviously
B	we're just a bit
C	bit a bit strapped for cash so we thought we'd just have and we we've also been strapped for time like away
B	just to get some space
C	us two and
A	yeah yeah
C	away from work and
B	be nice
C	yeah
B	we're staying in a place called
A	yeah yeah
C	walk around there on Friday
B	we'll walk we'll head up have a look round there on the Friday go to our hotel and then do walkies on the
C	Saturday and drive round
B	Saturday
C	I've took the Friday off
B	it's kind of the rock 'n' roll life I lead and we're finally getting some blinds for the hall like the landing so we'll actually have some we'll have complete privacy then there'll be
C	at the front yeah
B	curtains everywhere which will be good but they've cost us a small fortune haven't they?
C	curtains cost a lot don't they? like there's nothing you can do to avoid it unless you go and buy curtains that don't fit they cost a lot
B	yeah
C	I hate it
C	really hate it
B	like there's those like I don't know if you can remember but like on the landing we've got like a really tall skinny window
C	on the stairs
B	and then like a short fat window
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	so like trying to
B	it doesn't work
C	they don't exist
B	no
A	no
C	but we had obviously we had the guy from
A	yeah
C	it has to be tailor-made to the window it's gotta fit the window and yeah he he he did us a good job there
B	yeah
A	mm
C	but these like we've got we've we've ordered some Roman blinds so they've obviously got like you've got to pay for the fabric pay for the lining pay for the
C	we got them
A	yeah
B	got them in the sale and got some money off
B	but I just keep thinking like mum just keeps telling me like I know it feels like you're ploughing money in but just keep doing it because you'll get to a point where you go we're done
C	yeah
B	and then you can sit back and you can go right we don't have to worry about anything now
A	yeah
B	which is
C	but if you look at the rooms
B	we're getting there
C	they're all filling up
B	yeah
C	they're all basically done
B	we're getting there
A	Rome wasn't built in a day was it?
C	no it wasn't
A	you know what I mean? it all takes time
B	it's and I I'm actually starting to enjoy it now when we first moved in I feel I felt stressed about it all
C	yeah
B	cos we were trying to do too much too quickly
C	yeah
A	and you will get to the point where you don't need to spend anymore money
C	no
B	yeah it is nice and like we've just like even to the point where like we've started putting a few bits and pieces on the wall and it really does make a difference doesn't it?
C	oh yeah putting pictures on the wall
B	yeah
C	we've got some up in the guest bedroom so some up in the downstairs toilet er front bedroom on the
B	it does make a difference doesn't it?
C	there's stuff ordered for the
B	oh I haven't ordered that yet but yeah
C	yeah and then it'll fill up and then it'll look lived-in
A	fantastic
C	yeah
B	we've got plans for the for the hallway so like we'll have to paint it
C	yeah
B	before I wanna paint it before the blinds go up cos it'll just be a bit of a faff to try and paint around the blinds
C	that'll be alright I think that'll be a matter of finding
B	there's no rush for that
C	someone to do it
B	yeah I know
C	as opposed to
B	I know
C	that's the problem like obviously
B	they do charge you like they do charge you like the whole day even if it might take them like a few hours
C	yeah
B	because they're not gonna fit in another job
C	yeah it's awkward
B	it's like it's like I've been trying to find a plumber to come and do our erm
C	radiator
B	radiator in the en-suite like we've bought like a towel radiator so we want someone to come in drain the existing radiator and hopefully take it away and then fit the new one but like trying to find a local plumber to do like I mean that's that'll take them an hour if that like it's not a big job but trying to convince someone
C	I might give that a go on Sunday
B	I mean go for it but
C	I've got the spanners now
B	yeah
C	that's why I couldn't do it last time I didn't have spanners
B	I know I'm just scared about the valves but like go for it
A	if you want if you want the name or the number of the guy that I used
C	yeah
A	to fit our boiler and do some plumbing jobs for us
A	er and he'll come er and I if I ask him he'll come and do it for you
B	yeah cos it I did
B	I rang a guy I rang well I er I emailed a guy from that I found online and he rang me at the beginning of the week and he was just like oh like can I come and have a look? and I
C	couldn't he have just said Thursday?
B	yeah
C	Thursday at seven
B	so he's not been needless to say so
A	do you want me to have a word with somebody?
A	or or the
B	it needs doing
C	yeah it's just sat there for a few weeks isn't it?
B	it's been there since before Christmas
A	and if you want that if you want that wall doing just let me know and I'll I'll get somebody to give you a call
B	yeah pass on pass on whoever's details yeah cos we don't know we don't know any local people yet and it's really hard
A	so what so what plumbing do you want?
B	literally just a
C	just a radiator
B	heated towel rail
C	so we've got
A	out of your bathroom?
C	the radiator yeah
A	the en-suite so
C	it should be so easy
A	so take a radiator out
B	take a radiator off and put in
C	they can have they can have that radiator and they can sell that and they can use that like
B	it's brand new
C	it's brand new
B	erm but yeah we just want we want a heated towel rail put up in its place
C	all they have to do is
C	erm
B	I don't think a plumber would need your tools though
C	I've never used it so
A	yeah
C	yeah and just stick it on the wall plumb it in job done
B	it's not a big job
C	I could do it
B	I don't think
C	but
B	and like
A	leave it to me
B	and and the the radiator people sent us the valves sent them so
A	leave it to me
B	that would be good thank you oh dear
C	it's the little jobs like that that we don't have we don't have anyone with with like a skill or a trade I mean
B	yeah
C	contact with a
B	it's it is frustrating like those little things like at some point like I can just there's loads of little jobs that I see around the house where I think oh it would be really nice if we could do that but it's just it's a tiny little job and it annoys me that I can't just do it myself
C	yeah
B	but whatever
A	you can't fit in your bath?
B	no
C	right so the bath looks really nice and I mean it does look nice but it's the size of a normal bath but they've styled it so that it's you can't get much water in it and the sides of the bath are about that thick so the bath itself is a normal width well you add that and that on both sides you've only got a bath which is about that fat
A	yeah
C	so I can't even I can't even sit in it like this cos my hips are too wide
A	you're joking?
C	you can only just fit in it
B	yeah and it's snug but I can feel
C	yeah
B	both sides of the bath on my hips
C	so you sit in the bath and just like like I can't get my shoulders in my hips don't fit in
B	and like you can't you can't fill the water up because you just end up
C	yeah so
B	you no as soon as you get in the the water just goes like whoosh
C	and and this curve on the bath it's it's such an angle that like it doesn't go a sort of wall like that it just goes
A	yeah
C	it's this really smooth curve but it looks really trendy and it looks really nice
B	and you just think now that's
C	it's just
B	a brand new bath and all I keep thinking is I wanna buy a new bath
C	yeah
B	like
C	it's useless
B	it is absolutely useless
A	crap
B	and then like I look online and like oh
C	fit it
B	take my old bath away like
A	yeah
B	and fit the new one then
A	it's brand new
C	yeah
B	a brand new bath a brand new bath and it's probably more expensive
C	and it's it's a it's yeah it's a brand like
B	yeah
C	it's er
B	it will be it will be more expensive than whatever shit bath I
A	you buy
B	I replace it with
A	yeah yeah it's
B	but I
A	that's ridiculous
B	but I can't use it it's completely useless to me
C	but I played football once and I got home my feet were killing me I was just like oh I'm gonna run a bath
C	and you you could see I was struggling but obviously I'm a lot bigger than you
B	yeah
A	the first
C	just thought
A	first time in a new bath
C	yeah
A	and you couldn't get in
C	yeah and
B	it was ridiculous
C	then you tried it and it was the same
B	I walked I walked in and there was water all over the floor I'm like
C	I couldn't help it I sat in it and it just went
B	stupid and I've had I've had one bath and it was so uncomfortable cos you know like you kind of like a sink into a bath don't you?
A	yeah yeah
B	and you just can't do that
C	they they've probably done it so it only holds about ten litres of water
B	yeah
C	so you're saving money? so you'd be sitting there and you fill it as opposed to
B	so basically like
C	it
B	as it is I've never used the bath
C	yeah
B	so at some point I'm gonna have to replace it so that it's actually like worth having
C	yeah
B	stupid
A	that's a nightmare
B	but obviously like I mean it's funny because it's one of those things you'd I'd never have thought about checking
A	no well you wouldn't no I
B	no
A	got a bath
B	that's a pretty bath yeah I wouldn't have thought anything of it
A	the fact that it's not functional
C	it's quite bad
A	see our bath is one of those that stands up
C	yeah
A	it's a free standing and it
C	you've got a really nice bath
A	and it's huge
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you get in it and you know you the hot
C	you could get three people in that
A	you can you can swim you can swim in it
A	covers you quite easy
B	yeah
A	like
C	it's too big she floats away
B	well like your
A	yeah I must admit we we don't have a bath very often cos it
C	it's effort isn't it?
A	er and it's a faff if you haven't got like decent hot water that
C	yeah
A	you've gotta have the water trickling out for it to be piping hot
C	stay hot
A	soon as you add a bit of speed onto the hot tap it just goes lukewarm
C	yeah that's it
A	so you end up so you've gotta run it like
A	I'll have a bath in three hours when the bath's full
C	I've I've not been in a house with hot water as good as ours to be honest our hot water's on like two hours a day? and we've always got hot water
A	plenty of it?
B	yeah
C	plenty of it yeah
B	I mean I think a lot of that's to do with like all the crazy weird stuff that's in the house that naturally
C	keeps it warm yeah
B	keeps the water warm
A	it's good
B	anyway but yeah like it it's a massive waste I can never run a bath and like I
A	that's it
B	like a bath for me like you know if I've
C	do you want a bath tonight at mum and dad's?
A	you staying at your dad's tonight then?
B	well I
C	yours no
B	I'm going to see some friends in the morning and I've arranged to go with
C	great
B	you'd be happy about that
A	could even give
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah that's not a problem
A	I'll fish out my card
A	to see whether I've actually
B	yeah that's absolutely fine
A	remembered to put the money in the car
B	we should have should have brought we
C	yeah
B	my car's pretty snazzy I've been really happy with it this week
A	good
B	although like I had like a minor panic at the petrol station like which was just so me but like my old car had er the petrol tank was forty-five litres and I never really used to get below about like max like about forty litres so I was always aiming for about forty litres and I knew it would click about that but I was filling it up the other day and I got to like fifty litres and this
B	yeah and I'm thinking I'm paying for a load of fuel here that I don't think I need so I got in my car and everything and I've been driving for the last few days like not really I hadn't really looked into it but I looked at my manual today and apparently my fuel tank my fuel was fifty-five
A	a fifty-five litre tank
C	really big
B	I wasn't it's really
A	yeah sixty
B	yeah
C	yeah mine's fifty something
B	yeah I wasn't used to it and like it really threw me and obviously like also I wasn't used to like diesel prices so it was going up a bit like the price was going up
B	I ended up paying like fifty-seven pounds so I was like I haven't paid that for fuel for a long time
A	but you will do you you
B	and I was like what is that?
A	you will get a lot of miles out of it
B	well yeah cos like erm obviously that wasn't even it turns a
C	mm do you reckon you will?
B	erm yeah well I've done two hundred miles so far and it's only gone down to five hundred and sixty-eight
C	happy if I do five hundred but I'm doing town driving and like I said I pull away from lights a bit quick and
B	yeah
C	you're always trying to get somewhere quick and you don't you don't drive sensibly
B	but that's I I could be driving like I I got up to about fifty-seven point five miles per gallon and I haven't been able to get it much higher than that it took an absolute battering today like
C	did you?
B	sat in that traffic yeah erm so I'm down to like about fifty-six point four or something now
C	all you have to do is just lift your foot off the clutch
B	well it's hard when like I was on the slip road when I was stuck for like half an hour
A	nightmare
B	great so I'm like on this blooming slip road trying to join the A14 cos I tend to like there's this bit or like as you go past
B	so I did that this morning thinking I was being a smartarse but obviously didn't realise that it was accident traffic as opposed to congestion
C	so you just well yeah yeah I know
B	so I just hit traffic the other side on the slip road
A	and you sat there forever
B	sat there for half an hour
C	never heard of a road that's got so many accidents on
A	oh the A14 is a nightmare
C	breakdowns
A	A14 is a killer
C	what yeah what is it?
B	they're like it's just like even my timing this week's been so bad cos like so this morning I had to
C	it's so bad it's so
B	I I set off at four o'clock it took me half an hour to get through
B	it's so depressing like I hit it both ends I can't do anything about it
C	and the the road in between is one of the worst roads
B	it's shit yeah
C	yeah
B	I get and I
A	that
B	queuing to go through
A	that fills up as well yeah and I always go
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you're trying your hardest? and I was late for work yesterday and I set off at half past eight and got in at ten past ten
A	yeah
B	at least like if it took like took me two hours this morning but I wasn't late for work so it didn't feel quite as bad but when you were setting off that early and you think you're setting off that early to try and avoid all that it's
A	but on a good day you can do it in an hour can't you?
B	yeah on a good day like Fridays are normally meant to be good so if I set off at half eight on a Friday I'd normally be in the office for quarter past half past nine normally but
A	two hours is just taking the piss innit?
B	since I've got back after Christmas I've
A	that's crap
B	it's
A	yes
B	like it's been stressful and like just frustrating and like when you get to I got to work at half eight this morning and I thought I've already been up two and a half hours I'm knackered
A	yeah
B	but
B	I keep like the manager's been really understanding about it and we talk about it a lot but it's hard like I don't like being that person at work that people like have to feel sorry for because I've got this horrible journey especially when I'm doing it myself but it's really hard to like stay positive about it it's so shit it's hard I was like lift sharing for a bit as well
A	but winter's always crap
B	mm
A	in the summer the spring and summer is much better when it's daylight
B	yeah
A	you know when the roads are nice and dry and the sun's out and
B	I'm hoping so
A	it it's so much nicer in the good weather
B	yeah I know I know I know it will get better and
A	it's crap in the dark it always is you know
B	I don't like the first three months I was there like I know it was I know six weeks of those was over the summer holiday and so there was a lot less er a lot fewer cars on the road anyway but the first few months I was there I had no real problems
A	yeah winter's crap
B	winter has been awful
A	it is crap
B	and like they've they've put like new parking restrictions at work as well so like they've sold off like
A	yeah
B	so they've had to like completely renegotiate the car parking scheme so like what they did is they've put a limit on it now so anyone within three miles can't apply for a parking permit so anybody who lives within three miles of
A	yeah
B	well got to work yesterday at bang on ten o'clock and there was no car parking spaces
A	and then you can't park
B	and you then you can't fucking park I was so pissed off and then like as soon as I got in my manager sent me this email about punctuality and I wanted to hit the wall I was gonna kick off
A	it is it is ridiculous
B	well it's annoying it's a thirty-five mile journey
C	should be
B	it's depressing
B	yeah it is
C	yeah
B	so depressing especially
C	yeah
B	yeah well what I'm saying is limit-wise
C	yeah
B	like I know I travel through the city but
C	yeah
B	I probably do like ten miles max in the city the other twenty-five miles is like A1
C	A1
B	A14 M11
A	so it's you go down the M11 for the
B	two junctions
A	two junctions
C	yeah
B	yeah I can come off at
A	yeah
B	it is rubbish
B	yeah
C	in comparison
C	but but it isn't
B	but you you would do it in like you could do it in like thirty-five forty minutes
C	forty minutes yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	cos traffic coming through
C	oh yeah
B	no well we noticed like when we when we were car sharing to
C	if you left if you left at half seven everyone's got the idea of I've got to get to work for nine I don't wanna be late I will go early but there was a few times we left it like it was too late
B	yeah
C	but our journey was like half the time
B	yeah so we'd leave it like
C	but we we'd
B	we'd leave
C	I'd I'd be late to work
B	yeah we'd leave
C	but
B	at maybe like twenty past eight
A	yeah
B	sail straight in and you are pushing it by the time you get there
A	because
B	it's like nine o'clock
A	cos
B	yeah and you are getting there at nine o'clock on the dot and you know
C	yeah
B	if you do hit anything you will be late
C	yeah if something goes wrong
B	yeah
C	it's gonna go really wrong yeah but but
B	but
C	most of the time you just
C	drive straight in
B	even from
A	yeah
C	yeah it's so much
B	it's so stupid so I just stopped doing it the more the more chance you took with it the better off you tended to be and even even now I've found that the case like more often than not like if I leave sometime between half past eight and nine o'clock normally I would get there before ten but it only takes an accident
A	and that's it you're knackered
C	mm
A	that's the the A14 is a lousy road you know
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	driving back from
B	and yeah
C	on that Friday morning erm obviously I drove to
A	yeah
C	like it it was constant like
B	yeah
C	it's like
B	it is pretty depressing to be honest
C	and it'll be like that until nine
B	yeah
A	almost on top of it yeah
C	yeah
B	and then it's too late to do anything like I mean the journey I take I don't really have a lot of room for like detours anyway
C	yeah
B	so like when you hit the traffic it's not like I go oh I can come off at this turning it's fine like I need to take that road like there's no there's no way round it but it is frustrating when like especially like if I've
A	then you wish you hadn't started it yeah
B	like it's so frustrating
A	rubbish
C	not cool rubbish
B	no
C	yeah
B	not fun I
A	do you want another one
B	I don't thank you
C	been a couple of days to
A	er?
A	mm
C	takes me twenty minutes to get to work
B	yeah it only ever takes me
C	I can't
B	ten minutes
C	yeah I can't complain
A	the daily commute
C	yeah
A	everybody's bugbear
B	I don't I honestly don't know I don't know how people do what I'm doing like long time like
C	in London
B	like
C	my dad did
B	yeah
B	that's
C	it isn't it isn't it's not a lifestyle
B	no
C	I think but people do it don't they? it's crazy
A	I think I did it for three months but I used to I used to I was working over at
C	one one road
A	so living in
C	mm
A	oh no I you didn't you'd go along the A47 and you used to go through erm
C	okay
A	so I used to cut a chunk I
C	yeah
A	but I used to leave at half six and get into work at five to eight and then leave at quarter to five and get in for about quarter past half past six long gone days though
B	yeah
A	and it was seventy
C	mm yeah
A	and you're taking longer than that to do half that
C	yeah
A	half that distance
B	that's what that's the frustrating thing and that's what I find
C	got no routine I guess
B	no no chance I've like
A	it it is one of the worst roads in the country
B	yeah
A	I think the A14
B	you just can't do anything about it it's so annoying and it's hard cos I think like most people who commute do it for like I don't know more money or you know they have more responsibility and like mine's still very much an entry level job which means like the motivation isn't quite there to go all that way
C	if you've not gone somewhere to get there
B	yeah
C	so you've gone there to get somewhere
B	stress it it's just it's like you know like when you're having those like internal monologues when you're stuck in the traffic? at least if you if you thought like if I thought I was going to work and it
B	I haven't got any meetings I haven't got anyone that I need to see I haven't got anything that needs doing like urgently
C	nothing kicking off yeah
B	nothing's kicking off yeah it's really weird
A	it will
C	yeah
B	I hope so
A	it it will as the you know as you get the timing
A	it's just a shame you've got that journey
C	yeah
A	so is the train is a train not an option?
B	it's so expensive
A	is it?
B	just yeah it's like two hundred and eighty pound a month it's just
C	we
B	the money so say
C	yeah
B	well I got nine hundred pounds for my car so it would have
A	good
B	so it's like less than half what the train would cost me
A	and it would be a nicer journey
C	yeah well
B	so it's just
B	well yeah but it's it's like the thing is
A	no more comfortable in the car
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	it is and like the problem being is that trains the trains from
A	right
C	and they're full
B	and they're full and the only
C	and they take
B	the only trains I can get home are
C	and they take a while as well don't they?
B	it's shit
C	they take a while and they cost a lot and they're full and you're stuck to doing those times so you're stuck doing a terrible car journey that could go like really bad but it's cheaper you don't have to deal with like the limits in time but you have to deal with like the crappy roads but you get get the
A	spend a lot more money
C	yeah
A	probably have to stand up
C	yeah
A	all the way
B	well this is the thing cos as soon as you've got a season ticket you don't get a seat you only get a seat if you like pre-book so if you've bought like advanced tickets season ticket holders don't aren't ever guaranteed a seat so
A	so you could end up standing all the way standing all the way to
B	yeah
C	for an hour
A	yeah nightmare
C	it's crap
A	and you've got a season ticket
C	yeah
B	yeah and you're paying three hundred pound for the privilege no thanks
A	crap
B	yeah pretty crap
A	shall we er shall we go then?
B	yeah
C	yeah just have a
B	take a swig
A	oh it's quarter past ten
