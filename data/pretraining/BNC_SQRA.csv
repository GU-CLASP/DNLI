B	I know
A	I can't I can't juggle any more girls
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah?
B	and
B	literally
A	I would've just caved
B	I was just like went like oh yeah she's straight
A	oh I see yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah so no
A	did you ever see her?
B	chickened out
A	yeah
B	I think like I I I think you need quite a lot of balls actually
A	yeah I can imagine yeah
B	to do that
A	yeah
B	erm yeah
A	I can you would have to have done well
B	like I know
A	you would've had to have done really well
B	I'd've been really offended if she was like
A	yeah
B	definitely straight
A	yeah
A	definitely into boys
B	yeah exactly
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah I know I can imagine
B	yeah
A	it's a lot of pressure on both of you really wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	at least she felt confident like confident enough to talk to you to begin with though I guess it's a good first date
B	yeah yeah should be er true true but yeah no she never did forgot about that
B	should be like excuse me
B	you promised me
A	yeah
B	I
A	but I'm a bit like I'm really bad for sort of lying to people not on purposely like
A	it's just you just
B	I know
A	unless I reply instantly
B	I know I know I know
A	unless like I'm like a few days later I'm like shit gotta reply
B	I know
A	and talk to you
B	and kiss me
B	like yeah but like I've now like pushed it I like pushed her to the side
A	yeah
B	I was like I like anyway even if like
A	cos also that even if you were like
B	I know like
B	and for everyone else it was like annoying as well I'd find that really annoying if anyone started like
A	yeah
B	and
A	and
A	yeah
B	I'd get to the
A	it's just
B	I would get to the point where I'm literally like
A	yeah
B	like just don't even talk to me
A	yeah
B	and you're like you just kinda like stiffen up
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I was just like
A	but I think if you're not sure what your relationship is or whether you even have like a relationship you don't want someone kissing you in public
B	no no
A	no way
B	no
A	I wouldn't want that at all
B	no
A	yeah you don't want to make
A	cos like obviously guys guys love it when girls kiss in public and stuff and you just don't really want that attention in the gym do you?
B	no
A	you wanna go there work out and leave
B	yeah
A	you know
B	and also like on Saturday night
A	yeah
B	then and
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	not like yeah not in a gym really
B	no
A	but it's kind of weird that she does that cos you're a client essentially
B	yeah
A	you're a client of the gym like
B	I mean and I just I just like
B	and it and it yeah and if it is like that's a sign as well that you don't want someone
A	mm
A	yeah like
B	yeah
A	in public I was just so uncomfortable with him
B	yeah
A	because I
B	really? so it and that
A	he was just a bit weird and I think I was embarrassed by it and I just
B	yeah no and I think it is erm
A	yeah massively like I didn't really wanna hold his hand I
B	no
A	didn't wanna
B	yeah
A	I wasn't comfortable with him in public
B	yeah
A	and no that was a massive sign that we were
A	yeah
B	like yeah
A	no we went on a date
B	yeah
A	and it was just so uncomfortable
B	really?
A	it was just like
B	yeah and then it's really hard to come across like you do like
A	yeah
B	as your like your voice changes and like
A	yeah
A	okay yeah you really yeah you don't wanna feel sick kissing someone
A	like this is massive sign that you should not be kissing her
B	I know I know
A	when you're out of the gym?
B	and then out
A	yeah
B	I'll kiss anyone
A	yeah me too pretty much yeah
B	literally anyone
A	I'm pretty bad
B	like
A	yeah
B	I know
B	I know I know
A	don't you just wanna kiss somebody?
B	I know that's was like I used to like judge my night cos if I hadn't got it
A	yeah
B	then that was a shit night because
A	yeah
B	so
A	no one I found sexy or attractive
B	no
A	yeah
B	like I you know in that kind of setting it was just like
A	yeah
B	exactly
A	it's just like
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	in a club setting like
A	yeah
B	that
A	no
B	I mean it's like
A	it doesn't mean anything
B	and I think it makes everyone hornier as well
A	clubs make everybody horny
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so you're like if everybody else is getting with each other then damn it I wanna be involved in this
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you can just click your fingers and
A	and she's there yeah
B	I'm sorry I'm
A	no no it's fine don't worry
A	no no
B	still searching
A	it must be really weird
B	it is weird when erm
A	yeah
B	goes to the gym and I was like ah
A	ah
B	to the other
A	where's the other
B	in town
A	oh yeah yeah yeah I know
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	go
A	cheeky
B	yeah so
A	you're just juggling juggling all these people
B	yeah
A	I found
B	I no I I
A	no cos you're just so worried that someone will find out and like
B	yeah
A	there's somebody knows somebody knows somebody
B	especially if you're a lesbian
A	oh god
B	like it's like everyone knows like
A	the lesbian crew
B	exactly
A	mm
B	well not it's not I
A	yeah
B	especially if someone comes and keeps kissing you as well
A	yeah
B	it's gonna it's gonna be weird and that's why I'm like just like
A	but if you do end things with her
B	yeah I know I just
A	arrogant yeah yeah yeah
B	she was really upset and like when I saw her and like she
A	she was crying?
B	like like you know like when your eyes are like that kind of?
A	oh like glazed or like yeah
B	and I was like
A	but you know that they're clinging onto something don't you?
B	I know
A	yeah
B	and let her like
A	oh well
B	oh
B	no I know
A	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	we got with each other and everybody's like
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah so? like
B	yeah exactly
A	it was just it was just a kiss we were just making out like it doesn't mean
B	I know I know
A	I know
