A	I think you could have it on in the background
B	no I on on some of the last recordings it's like it's quite loud so
C	Buje there was er there was a market there but not this not today I don't think
D	you wanting to go to that
A	yeah is that up there?
D	yeah that's that way
C	you
A	I don't know where now or whatever
D	yeah
A	maybe that's it
D	I think it's a little way up there
A	what Rovinj?
D	Rovinj yeah
C	well what's there? is that another hotel is it?
A	yeah I think so isn't that where
C	no
A	yeah
B	so if like if pieces of art are worth like like from people we haven't heard of are worth like four grand now it's well er it's a bit of a silly question I was gonna say how much are like the Mona Lisa and The Scream and all the famous art?
D	yeah
B	I mean really
A	I suppose the more famous the artist is the bigger the figure for his work but I don't know how I mean Banksy's work how do you is it not just the how he operates that that increases the value of his work?
B	probably
A	you know the fact that no one knows who he is and
B	I can't believe
D	he has an agent
A	how did he first come to sort of say I'm Banksy but I'm staying anonymous?
D	don't know
B	so I'm sure his agent must know who he is
A	must do
B	let's hope they never fall out cos that's a
A	yeah I'm sure he's got clauses written into er
B	see all those like little watchtowers?
A	what's that
B	there's a little wooden thing there
A	by the side of the road?
C	yeah I've seen a few of those
D	in the fields yeah it's we er it look it look like the ones you know that are like when you see in films around concentration camps?
B	yeah
A	did you see those that's what I was the word I was thinking of those little
D	no idea what store pots?
A	that we saw in the fields
D	oh I don't know
A	where d'you get that from?
C	I think they're shepherds' huts aren't they some of them?
D	that's what I thought they would be
A	close your eyes love
B	what does that sign mean with the little
B	was it across?
C	the road left and right there
B	oh
A	there's a river just up there to the left
C	yeah
A	what's that? there's a cycle path there
B	why when do they usually do it in the UK?
A	it's usually a lot later on in the summer whoops
B	like when?
A	like August
B	August?
A	yeah
B	like I said though it's probably
A	yeah
B	you know it's still a lavender plant but it's genetically different
A	but mine don't survive
B	yeah cos I mean it makes sense that erm a lavender plant that er that's a pretty cool
A	yeah
B	erm that a lavender that is grown in Croatia has to survive hotter summers than it does in the UK which makes it harder wearing and then gradually over time and like natural selection the lavender plants just you know
A	evolves
B	yeah almost I mean if you think about it if you if you think about how natural selection works the strongest survive while the rest die and then the strong pass on their genes to the next thing so you know say
A	yeah
B	and then the you're everybody else has got that gene and it takes thousands and thousands of years but
A	they look exactly the same don't they?
B	I know but
A	I can't think what that's about
B	biker gang in California
A	have you watched the whole thing?
B	I watched the first like
B	yeah
A	yeah but do you know I was thinking that
B	it said it in that book and I remember
A	oh
B	and erm er you can get a driving licence as young as like I think it was fifteen? or maybe fourteen I can't remember it might have been fourteen erm
A	wow
B	which is
A	it is really
B	it is especially crazy seeing as what? you can't drink until you're twenty-one but you can drive a car when you're fourteen fifteen
A	and how old do you have to be to have
B	er
B	is she? there's another
A	no I dunno but it said
B	no it said
A	okay
B	K O L O
A	I think I'm sure that worked then this is where we're going to is that
B	do quite like the Audi SUVs
A	HGVs?
B	Audi SUVs
A	oh okay
C	no well I thought they had to mature
A	no
C	and that I dunno what sort of crop you get off every tree like I suppose it depends how old it is how big it is but
B	you're a very noisy breather
A	it's got
B	sorry what was that?
A	someone had pizza
B	that's pretty cool
A	I wonder where the guys live
B	god knows
A	I've got heat rash
B	I would quite like you know like one of those like choppers like do you not remember
C	yeah
B	I quite like the look of them
C	it's come from Italy this one then is that a Harley is it? sounded it didn't it?
A	oh
C	this way
B	no
C	no cos we have to go over this erm
B	Harley-Davidsons are really expensive aren't they?
A	I think they are I think it's their reputation really I don't
B	no that's the only like motorbike company I know of though innit? like
A	probably yesterday er was it? I thought it usually went on over like a bank holiday weekend
C	er I er well I this weekend for sure I dunno really
B	I well I saw people like piling in a couple of days ago like even before the music had started and it looked like absolute chaos
C	it was all very wet and muddy weren't it?
A	which day was that?
B	I can't remember I remember seeing like videos on Facebook of people like
C	I would like to go as long as it didn't rain
B	yeah
C	would you not come with me
B	no
C	oh this looks like a causeway anyway we've got this bit right for this
A	I think we didn't come this way before
C	don't think so
B	water looks very greeny can you see?
C	oh there's a big road bridge up there perhaps we went across that one
B	see like how could oh I suppose they're just going down to the seabed aren't they? I was gonna say how would you like structure this so it's not just you know?
C	just really built it up on rocks and stuff haven't they? just a causeway
C	was that you
A	what do you mean was it me?
C	I was wondering if
B	yeah looks like a bit like a campsite
A	is that the really long road bridge then there?
C	no
B	I'd say er
C	no I think it was about half a mile up here and then a road off to the left I think
A	this is er it says this is the way to Rovinj I'm not sure why
C	it is yeah
A	I suppose there's more than one way isn't there?
C	well you just follow the coast round don't you?
B	is it this
C	erm
C	dunno all his stuff in there I suppose
B	I would have thought he'd just get one big one but
C	oh hang on

C	roof box
B	roof box
C	we used to have one didn't we?
A	yeah
B	can't remember
A	we still have oh no you sold it
C	no we sold it when we sold it to make some space I think
B	I don't like those windows when they only like open a little bit cos you don't get any air you're just like
A	I think there's a key for there's like er at the top of the window that you only open it like a centimetre er you can turn the handle then and it stays
B	sorry I'm confused what you mean
A	I thought you said you've just seen a window but you didn't like it cos it didn't open
B	mum my ears are going funny I
A	I think it that er
