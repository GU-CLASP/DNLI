C	oh yeah they are good with bare feet
F	but I think they're just very artisanal

B	into your shape or something
F	I hope you don't
F	yes I hope you don't
B	well wear them into your shape
F	well when they're on you they look okay actually

C	oh
F	oh right
C	my toes are enjoying that fur
A	oh
F	we bought on erm one of the islands while we went
C	yes so
F	after
C	right
C	it's on the it's on a piece of mainland? or not
B	well the
C	yes but then there's a
C	off the coast there's a
B	we have a map
C	oh great cos it's not somewhere I've ever had any and and it this something that have you brought this as well? and what on earth is it?
F	ah yeah the er
F	my
B	well I wanted to use up my coins in the in er in the erm
F	the
B	airport
A	they're sour
B	and
A	not not salty
B	that's the only thing that came out of the machine all the other ones said it wouldn't sell them to me
C	is it liquorish?
B	I we
C	yes
B	and he said no no that's nothing to do with salt
C	ingredients they look like
B	yes it's
C	yes
B	supposed it's supposed to be erm sour sour sweets
C	yeah I'm not er I'm not not feeling the urge to open it right now
B	no no no
C	would you mind not doing that
C	thank you though
C	kindly
B	well the other ones
F	I
B	were whoever wants them but
A	oh I'll have them
C	there's
F	that's
C	right yes but where is it in
F	er in the country
C	yeah that
F	oh I don't know if we did though did we?
C	bit more useful
B	no
F	I don't think we had that
B	it's opposite Denmark is that
F	it
B	mm
F	directly
B	er
F	opposite the top of Denmark and in fact we had the most amazing geography lesson flying over on Monday because it was so clear and you could see the coast of Denmark just as it is on
C	like on a map
F	and I was thinking how the early explorers had to you know row themselves round to get the coastline and there it was just absolutely Denmark
B	mm
F	where's where's
B	well the
F	where's the city from here?
B	the city's up here
A	okay
F	and then we went out to
A	mm
F	and it went here and it went all the way down here and over an amazing bridge here turned around and came back and then we
C	and what are these islands sort of inhabited
F	just
C	or they kind of wildlife reserves?
B	no these are all inhabited
C	with
B	they're quite large more like to my mind I'd say holiday
F	holiday homes
B	homes
C	right okay
B	that place but the the cars are allowed on on these islands
F	on the northern one not the southern
B	so there's roads and cars
C	mm
B	but on these ones there's no cars allowed at all
C	and did you go to those ones?
B	no we only got as far as the ferry
F	we
B	the ferry terminal
F	we looked at it
C	mm
F	from there
C	uhu
F	yesterday
C	uhu
F	when we came back
C	okay
B	cos I mean it's not far
F	no
B	or or the map look makes it
C	oh it's just over the way
B	yeah yeah mm
C	and and is that bit considered to be part of
B	yes cos the it's all part of the the ferries there there's no charge for the ferries
C	no charge for the ferries?
B	mm
F	well no cos we had a ticket
B	no no no but the locals don't pay
F	oh right
B	the ferries are free because it's part of
C	getting around?
B	getting around
C	part of life
B	that part yes
F	to the southern archipelago it's quite
B	but the southern archipelago I think you had to
C	had to pay
B	you have to pay it was it was only the northern one
F	no but we got a three day transport card
C	and in your postcard which I've only read once cos it's only just come
F	oh it's only just come?
C	trams and all sorts yes trams
F	what did we say?
C	there was erm trams
F	ah yes
B	loads of trams
F	we got great value from our tickets on the trams yes it worked so well you see I think it's cos the populations are small and these are compact cities
A	it's Denmark
F	no this isn't Denmark
C	this is Sweden I'm looking at now
C	whereabouts is it in this country on this map?
F	it
C	is this Sweden? or am I in the right country?
F	yes
C	yes?
F	Sweden has a
B	there you are
F	yeah there you are
C	and that's the coast of Denmark where you were just the other day
B	yes with your
F	yes where we were down here
C	it's a bit further down yes
F	but you could see from the plane all the way this
C	yeah
F	and then you could see the sand in the distance and I never realised it's so much water in Sweden it
C	yeah
F	huge lakes tiny lakes it's so
C	it's all like broken up isn't it? it's just
F	and it's really rocky
C	yes you were just saying that these islands
F	and suddenly you
B	mm
F	come across er I've got
C	oh hey
D	they're very nice
A	they're furry inside
C	furry on the inside
A	she's so
B	did
F	wait
B	er er down here
F	that's my
B	I think there's a
F	darling I I've I opted for sweeties instead of
E	they're all
C	but they're Swedish
A	I was hoping that it would be one big lolly but
D	get
A	but I think
C	you could
D	you couldn't
F	I used to think with the Chupa Chups that they were one big lolly and then I think one of you told me they weren't
C	I don't think we've ever had one though
F	the fjords
C	I suppose
F	yes
C	yes and I suppose
B	yeah
C	when you think about it we know the edge of it's all fjords there's that bit in erm
E	oh yeah
C	yeah
B	I think you'll have to cut that with a knife
C	that's what the other two did
B	that
C	you know how good they are at flowing throwing knives around the place
F	well we didn't bring we did we have got them but we didn't bring them I felt that you'd probably wouldn't be up to that tonight but yes we did
C	oh good super
F	it's not a
C	is it an old city is it a pretty city?
F	well you see it's not it it's a very solid city
C	solid?
F	and
C	yeah
F	so they didn't have lots of
F	buildings the way Denmark has
C	right yeah
F	or Holland has
F	well done
F	no one else managed that erm and so there are a lot of erm eighteen hundred very well built tall five six storeys high
C	mm
F	substantial buildings
C	mm
F	and they've all stood the test of time really haven't they?
B	they have yes yes
F	but one there's one modern building that one called the Lipstick Tower just that there
C	is it
B	oh yes
C	one of Sweden's larger?
F	this is called the Lipstick Tower
A	oh uhu
F	that's modern
E	this is the
C	isn't it?
F	there it is again
E	uhu
C	okay yeah yeah
F	so that was very interesting sculpture we've got a photo of that that was by the fish market that was nice
C	yeah
F	it's er fish
F	water they're seafaring but
B	something like that wasn't it? yes yes
C	oh
F	fantastic building that's the oldest building in the city
B	and yet it was it was Roman fort at one time
F	well and the Vikings
B	and the Vikings were there
F	though we did see a Viking erm
C	right
F	which is like the Mary Rose well we were a bit disappointed because I think in my head I was going to see a Viking ship but actually it's it's laid out on a sort of rounded platform
B	it's just a few planks of
C	it's not in one piece?
B	rotten old wood
F	oh well the pieces of
B	just a few pieces of wood
F	the pieces where they found them you see
C	just incidentally in your passing comment there for the Mary Rose er as far as I could tell the kids' experience of the Mary Rose was one of the more lasting experiences they've had
F	yeah but it's wonderful isn't it? but they
C	yeah
F	I mean they were all a lot younger then I was saying
C	and do you know
F	oh every time I go by there darling I'm sad about that Leonardslee
C	he he he
F	yes I have very good memories of that too
B	mm but
F	oh well I'm delighted you do darling because
C	yes
F	because we're so lucky when we have your company when we've
D	haven't they
F	done these things
C	and you get in
F	yeah
D	mm
C	oh can you manage to get into your lolly darling? erm
C	so is
F	yeah
C	right
F	and it's big yes
C	okay and how big is it?
F	I don't know do you know the population?
B	no it's
F	probably says on that map I don't know
C	like roughly how did it feel?
F	it didn't feel
C	yes
F	it was very different because it's not the architecture is much more solid and it's not sort of pretty and staggering and amazing
C	yeah
F	it's staggering in the way it's been constructed and the buildings some of the buildings have wonderful ceramic friezes right up high
C	oh that's interesting
F	all the way along I mean really the big friezes beautiful colours yeah
C	that's an old
F	yeah well you see but it er they are about seventeen hundred
C	do you want the knife?
F	yeah our own hotel eighteen eighteen I think
B	I think
C	I did look at your hotel online erm before I went and it that was in
F	oh we were very well placed
B	very close to the central square yeah
F	yeah
B	yeah
C	and I got the impression it was by a square I didn't know
F	didn't want to be right on the main drag but we were on the parallel main drag
C	okay
F	but we
C	and was the hotel suitable?
F	oh it was very it was fine
B	yes
F	very nice
B	very nice very nice yes yes
C	and in the postcard you said you were at a seafood restaurant somewhere I say so it's sea fish that sort of thing lots of
F	yeah yeah yeah
B	yes that was on the island we went to
F	that was on the island we went
C	yeah?
F	yes
C	but it general the food was good? you found nice places to eat?
F	yes it was very healthy
C	healthy
F	it was very healthy they are very health conscious very conscious
C	were there what was it lots of help yourself
F	well when there was
C	well I suppose in hotels yeah I suppose in hotels there would be
F	yes but also in the café
B	mm
C	that's interesting
F	they don't like waste
C	no indeed none of us do
F	and also there were restrictions on buying alcohol too like all Scandinavian countries
C	oh the you're gonna have to go to a government owned
B	mm
C	alcohol shop? but restaurants still sell wine
B	the restaurants and hotels
F	very interesting
B	sell them yes yes
C	mm mm
B	and but
F	I tell you one thing though
C	mm?
F	the entire city well certainly the whole area that we covered has been repaved over time I mean it might have been paved originally er it's been
C	or
F	repaved with small blocks
C	god how irritating
F	they're really difficult to
B	yeah
C	really difficult for you
F	absolutely really difficult
B	where we were
C	but
C	anybody in high heels or anything as well
F	no we that
B	you never saw anybody
F	nobody wears them
B	in high heels
C	well
B	I think one person that saw you saw but like
F	I saw two people sort of
F	yes
C	you can see why not
F	and when we saw someone in the hotel with high heels we said she's not going out
B	she's not going out
F	no no
B	like curb stones
B	set in the middle of of the
C	that you then kind of decide to walk along
B	to walk along yes
F	they're not raised not raised
B	not raised
F	no no no
C	no but for some reason that no god how irritating
F	but but and er but you see everybody's vying for those
C	yeah
F	I mean with a pram not wide enough for a pram those
C	no no no no
F	you know just for one wheel and so all this I only ever saw one mobility scooter and I thought yeah because no way are you going to be on a mobility scooter
C	gosh isn't that interesting and as you say it's been redone all like that at some point how funny
F	well I guess it always was
C	yeah
F	but this is I don't know how long ago but I mean it's it's modern
B	no I mean they were
F	er
B	in good condition it wasn't as if
C	yeah
F	yeah they
B	they were falling apart so
F	oh yeah they were fine
B	they were obviously
F	they weren't like wobbly like the top of
C	there's
F	of
C	but you see whenever they put those that those slabs in down by erm the
F	mm
C	you know those funny ones where they catch a tiny bit of water that then freezes?
F	yeah
C	that was quite poorly thought through and it sounds like
F	yes
C	this was quite
F	yeah
C	poorly thought through as well but talking of wearing high heels I forgot to tell you when I went to the Co-op just now for supper
E	with the old woman?
C	no no I've never seen this woman before
E	how old was she?
C	and she was young and she had lots of blonde hair and the top half of her head it was kind of up I think it was in rollers kind of around big black things but kind of about this big which I think is probably rollers so I think she was drying it before going out or something like this the bloke who was standing in front of her turned around and everybody heard this and said he must have just like caught her and said oh oh you off to a Halloween party or something?
C	and
C	and he said well I am also quite clumsy actually
F	where you say where was this?
C	in the Co-op
B	in the Co-op?
C	yeah
F	down here?
C	yeah exactly it
F	but also the clothing I mean
C	yeah it was like she had barely er barely anything on
F	hardly anything yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah exactly
F	well
C	so she certainly wasn't going out in
F	she didn't say oh yes I am?
F	stunned into silence
D	what are these?
F	yeah
C	well we're all we were all intrigued well I don't know how intrigued I am actually
F	yeah
B	yes they're
C	well were what
B	well it's all the machine would give me yes
F	at the at the airport
B	there were more appropriate things to get
D	it has ninety-two grams of carbohydrates instead of seventy-one point nine grams of sugar
C	it's also made of
D	yeah
C	I saw there was erm they've got a new er money change machine at Kings Cross this week for the
A	oh yeah
C	you can put
E	yeah yeah
C	coins in
E	heard about that on the radio
F	ah I read about that
B	oh yes
C	yeah
B	and you
A	you heard about it on the radio on Friday
C	but all sorts of old currency
B	your old coins
C	and new currencies
F	yeah
C	and these
C	and that and the other yeah exactly
F	yeah
C	mm
A	the radio we listened to
C	cos it cos Sweden's not EU is it?
B	no
C	so it's not euros what is what are they called?
F	krona
C	krona
F	er
B	confused with Danish krone
C	which you had some of of course
F	no er or or
C	mm
F	or Faroe Islands
B	yes
F	or any of Norway I think
C	did
B	they have
C	or they have
B	yeah Danish they have they
F	they have their own
B	they are tied though
C	they are
B	to the Danish krone so they're two

C	okay right fine you've yes you've
F	yes we have
C	er yes that's yes
F	yeah
C	yes yeah
F	yes
C	harking back to your Viking ancestry or something
F	yes well the Vikings it was interesting actually
C	mm
F	once I got over the fact that it wasn't
C	a ship
F	but it was so hot in there er I reached a point I was just
B	yes it was quite warm wasn't it?
F	completely claustrophobic
B	well I suppose cos it's cold outside and you go into
F	I had to
B	well no it wasn't actually you're right
F	it isn't usually this mild everyone
C	okay but is it the same sort of temperature as here? is that what it was roughly or?
F	yes well yes it was but we didn't get the rain
C	the right okay
F	and we had three dry days
C	yeah lovely
F	we had no rain
C	yeah that's
F	until we were coming in to land last night
B	mm
C	yeah right okay
F	and coming in to land last night the plane this large plane
C	mm
F	and all the people er were coming we assume were coming back from
C	mm
F	a lot of them knew each other but then they could have been going for a medical conference in
C	uhu
F	and they were all in very sort of relaxed way
B	in jolly jolly mood
C	I see
F	as though their week had ended
C	oh maybe it had
F	in the morning erm there'd only been one person on the plane going over
C	so I should explain this so granny and
E	yeah you have
C	you know that and did I explain why the plane er flies from
E	yeah
C	okay
A	no what?
A	okay
C	and so this is just a regular flight but they've paid for did you say twenty?
B	twenty seats
F	twenty seats
C	twenty seats
B	on each flight
C	each flight so it flies out at seven in the morning and back at seven in the evening
F	whether they're full or not
A	okay
C	so they pay for twenty seats
F	I mean we all have to pay
B	mm but
C	yeah but that's it's to make sure the airline don't stop running it
A	mm
C	so there was only one other person on the plane when you went out?
F	no this
B	that's what the that's what the
C	oh they had said
B	stewardess said
C	nobody had gone back
A	yeah
C	well it's er kind of interesting because but that's like hire cars
B	there's
C	they all end up the wrong end
B	so when we went out there were five of us on the plane
C	and how many can you fit on the plane?
B	thirty-two
C	okay
B	it's not a big plane
C	no
B	and then when we came back I would say there was probably about twenty-eight people on board
C	and mainly
B	well I would say so
F	they were all a bit
B	there was there was a couple of people recognised
F	there was a lady in high heels she obviously hadn't been in
B	yes
B	but the stewardess said that erm and I can't remember when but she said for four weeks the plane was completely full on every flight
F	yeah
B	backwards and forwards
C	right
B	for four weeks
F	they must have tranches
B	so they must have tranches of them
C	mm mm mm but what
C	what airline is it?
F	well it's called Sun Air
C	right
F	but it's working under the auspices of British Airways now I don't know why that should be but it's a Danish line
C	okay
F	yeah
C	okay
F	and they were Danish the crew we had the same people you see both ways
C	yeah
F	and she said oh hello lovely to see you again
A	they obviously don't have many customers
F	yes
C	you might be noticeably not
A	do they actually fly the plane if nobody's on it?
C	well they would probably need to they would need to get it to the other end
F	well yeah
C	to bring it back this way
A	oh yeah that would be nice flight actually
B	I assume they do
A	just like mess about
F	I mean on the way out they didn't even
A	it would just like
F	shut the door between the cockpit and us
C	they didn't shut the door to the cockpit and you?
B	no no
F	on the way out
C	bloody hell that's extraordinary
E	it's against the law
C	that's
B	I had a great view as it came in to land
F	we could see them all the time chatting away and
B	yeah
A	is this actually
C	that
A	like cabin
C	that's like totally against the law
F	I know
C	mind you er if one of them had started to you know press the thing forward and drive into a mountain you could have dived in there couldn't you you see?
F	well there were two there were two of them in there
C	two of them in there
F	there were two pilots and that was
C	yes they
F	yeah yeah
C	can assume they weren't both planning on driving into a mountain
F	but on the way back he he came er er the
C	oh cos you're right at the front are you? so for your leg?
F	well no he
C	oh not necessarily
B	we weren't
F	we were but you're not I'm not supposed to be
C	oh you're not supposed to be near the
F	no
C	exit?
F	no we were meant to be line
B	seven er yeah in the middle somewhere
F	so I was heading for row seven and then
C	mm
C	mm
F	and I said but I'm not allowed
C	mm
F	and he said no no we have to go so
B	well I wasn't to
F	they were doing us a favour but I mean that's completely wrong I mean
A	it's the breaking the law blatantly
F	you know you understand why? it's because if there's an emergency you know I'm in the way I'm no help
B	and just get the door open and
F	yeah
B	you're in the way
C	well in the where would be if there's not an emergency
F	oh yes yes but you can't choose to
C	no
F	you can't choose this it's
C	no
F	so when the pilot came to shut the door he was almost apologetic to you wasn't he?
B	he was yeah he was
F	he was er I think I have to do this
B	I'm sorry about this I've got to shut the
A	it's it's
C	yeah
E	is
C	oh yes darling of course you can try them sweetheart
A	you can try them for us in case they are in fact salty sweets

E	well it might be like pretend salt do you wanna try one?
F	maybe it
B	no thank you
B	I think
E	I suppose

C	James Bond film
F	what did you think of it darling?
A	you said James Bond film three times in one
C	sorry I don't know why he was
A	that's cos it I think that's just
F	I thought the review is better than the last one when
D	James Bond is actually
C	yeah
F	yes
C	okay they weren't very well reviewed yeah better than the last one
D	it definitely it definitely wasn't better than the last one
C	you it wasn't better than the last one?
D	yeah the last one was
C	no no no no the last one was that one what did you call it?
A	Skyfall
D	yeah
C	no Skyfall wasn't the last one there was that other rubbish one in between
E	what Quantum of Solace?
C	oh that one
E	Skyfall was the last one
A	it it goes
C	oh okay
A	Skyfall Quantum of Solace
C	actually I haven't got a clue
C	I don't know why I'm even
B	and is
F	Quantum of Solace
B	the first and then Skyfall?
A	yeah
E	yeah Quantum first
A	it's Quantum of Solace
B	and then Skyfall then
A	those were the first ones
B	oh right
C	oh were they
E	yeah
A	yeah that's why they're so bad
C	I read some people at a convention the other day are
E	what kind?
C	well I dunno they were all in Star Wars outfits and stuff
D	oh okay
C	and they were
C	and other kind of
E	nerd nerd nerd
C	things yeah exactly and they were talking about the Star Wars
E	I'm sure you told me about that one
C	film the trailer had just come out
D	oh yeah
E	yeah
C	and
C	watched it eighty-four times or whatever but so in these various people in this interview it's fascinating you know the erm
E	okay
C	of films to hear just how sort of coruscatingly rude the er Star Wars fans are about these
D	yeah yeah
E	yeah well
B	but when they first came out they were
C	no no that's very
B	fantastic
E	what do they what do they all think about the new one?
C	no well apparently from the trailer it's looking like it's gonna be better than the the three early ones
E	I guess it's
D	but it's always hard to tell
E	it's not a
C	yes
E	that is it?
C	it's well I dunno where where in the series is the
E	it's number seven
D	I don't know
E	no it is it's number seven
C	so it's the most futuristic?
C	so to speak
E	I suppose
A	so what's gonna happen?
C	I have no idea what's going to happen darling it comes out at Christmas time
B	what which card?
E	did anything significant happen in the news while we were in on camp? I was just thinking
B	it was here
F	the
A	yeah they arrested the
C	they arrested a fourteen year old
E	yeah I heard about that
C	for hacking TalkTalk
A	which is really funny cos it's a fourteen year old
C	er there was as I said to you
C	that thing in Syria
B	er
C	about
B	oh no
F	oh right erm
C	and what else happened in the news while you were away? oh unfortunately
F	yes
C	a boy got stabbed at er to death at school
E	what school?
C	not one of your schools
A	where?
C	Scotland
E	I see
F	oh
C	but I find that very upsetting cos
A	yeah
C	I mean I was saying
A	what age?
F	oh it I think
C	a sixteen year old well no I think the thing is is it's it's a school a bit like your school so that where you wouldn't where you wouldn't necessarily expect and obviously you don't
E	oh right
C	which is just dreadful
F	I know the the last
A	yeah
F	has arrived
C	oh yes I I told you that
C	what
E	yeah
C	well
F	yeah
C	he's been cleared to come home for like years like
F	yeah I know but it's something
C	like seven or eight years so I don't understand what I just don't I just don't understand
E	I'm not sure anyone understands
A	presumably he has the rights to come home
C	well to be he's actually not British he just lives in Britain but he does have rights to be here so but they said they said seven years ago that they weren't gonna charge him and he could leave
D	no cos he got arrested after nine eleven didn't he? and he hadn't done anything?
C	well the thing the problem with the people in Guantanamo Bay is it doesn't really
E	that's really bad idea
C	to bring to them people who might be
E	what?
D	well I'm going to do some more homework
C	okay you go and do some more homework posture posture posture posture posture
D	it's enough to say it once
C	well clearly not I said it once about in nineteen ninety-two love you
A	that that will look very odd on the record
C	what? oh we haven't told granny and
A	oh we're recording
F	what are we?
A	ourselves
F	you were recording?
A	yeah cos er for a science experiment
F	right
A	they're paying eighteen quid an hour of recording
F	right
C	we met these erm er these scientists when we were at the ideas thing
F	oh the ideas thing
C	and
E	mm
C	and the funny thing was that I saw banjaxed is there and the two women on the stall had never heard the word banjaxed and they said
E	neither have I
C	lots of other people hadn't heard the
F	no I think it's quite Irish
B	mm
A	what's it say?
C	oh is it Irish?
A	what is it what is it again?
C	buggered basically
A	oh
C	it's when something's like broken or and it's some
F	had it
C	something else has gone wrong
F	generally had it
C	some yeah and it kind of it's like the fault or the banjaxed thing is sort of external to it so anyway
F	yes
C	and they were really really really short of families talking to each other cos they've got lots of students basically
F	right okay
C	so they said well you know and and then so I took a leaflet and then
E	and
C	we could just turn the phone on and record ourselves talking and it's not very difficult and er
A	and so we just record ourselves eating
F	right
C	yes and yeah unfortunately I don't know if the words we use are necessarily representative
C	yeah I guess yes that mm anyway so there you go
F	so is that over now the
C	yeah it finished
F	runs for quite a while
C	it
F	right oh well I'm sorry all your plans for Halloween are not working out however at least it means that the boys will have to move round their beds and things I suppose and erm you know I hope you can find other things
C	well as I say I think we'll probably go to the cinema us three
F	mm yeah
C	erm because I was wondering cos obviously dunno it's such a sort of cultural icon James Bond we yeah so yeah I kind of preface the sentence with obviously you know we'll
A	yeah I I'd
E	yeah
A	like to go and see it
C	yeah you'd like
A	well but with all of the expectations
F	I think everyone talks about it
A	that it sucks
C	yeah
E	uhu
C	well exactly
A	and I still want to see it
C	and as it happens that
F	yeah
C	we can go to
F	yeah so what time is the party till darling? are
C	I don't know
E	oh
C	I don't know trying to extract any information is a challenge
E	well there's well
C	well
E	in the countryside so it's probably like ten
C	it's not way out in the countryside it's only in
E	I know
E	I know but we generally are out in
C	er we in the
E	yeah well that's
C	well if you live in the bloody countryside just you know it's a bit ironically that I'm driving him to a party in the countryside rather than
F	yes
C	people in the countryside driving their kids to a party in the town
F	well I mean the er
C	well
E	mm
C	brightly said that he'd walk home
F	no
C	but yeah I think
F	he's not doing that
F	alone?
C	well not at midnight obviously
F	oh right
C	but yeah in the daytime you could do I think she has done yeah
F	oh well no you'd need to be have comfortable shoes
C	I don't know if he is wearing his stilettos tomorrow
F	no
C	it's
F	yeah mm
C	erm yeah but anyway
F	have you got any homework sugarplum?
A	er yeah I've got
F	yeah
C	and then a bit more
A	we need to find The Boy in Striped Pyjamas
C	oh yes I've got that on the list find Boy in Striped Pyjamas and I haven't done it all all week although I've been it's been on the list all week and I haven't achieved it yet erm
F	achieved what?
C	finding a book that he needs
F	right and also presumably you're catching up on sleep?
C	yeah and having another bath
F	and do you
C	and everything yeah
F	do you only get
C	what on camp?
A	yes
F	yeah? do you find? I mean
A	yeah
F	he doesn't look quite so tired
E	mm
C	it probably helps that there are a lot of hours of darkness so you don't have the sun waking you up at
E	mm mm
C	four in the morning or two in the morning
A	but well we stay up much later than normal
C	than our normal
F	yes you would yes you would
A	yeah
C	but they did they explain it?
A	I was up till half twelve
C	they
A	oh
C	camp time or normal time?
A	er camp time yeah
F	you had camp time?
C	yeah
F	ah
A	so there's two hours forwards so you have four hours of daylight when you're awake
F	oh I see right
A	which means that the escort from the campsite to London left at five and came back at four
A	yeah
C	yeah
F	yes we were a bit confused back and forth as the
B	mm
F	sun kept just changed anyway mm
C	but I think that was quite I mean it's a good solution really so cos otherwise if you're trying to like do cooked supper and stuff er and it's dark at five o'clock
F	yeah
C	you know so I we they'd never done
F	did you get hungry?
A	no
F	no? you were alright did you get
A	we had
F	hungry
E	no
F	no?
C	oh did you?
A	yes
E	we had loads of food we kept being given cake just to get rid of it
A	between four people they had four cakes
C	you were not short of food at all well yeah that roadkill
F	and darling how does
E	yeah
F	the outside of the house look?
C	looks fine yeah
F	have you been to see?
B	no I haven't been to see no
F	so the scaffolders came?
C	the scaffolders came
F	over two days wasn't it?
C	no they didn't come on the first one they came on the second one
B	Tuesday?
C	no not that one
F	the Wednesday
C	the Wednesday they came on
B	oh the Wednesday
C	erm
A	okay
C	and then I'm trying to think what else happened erm
F	I hope someone's come to measure the roof
C	er yeah they've come and they've measured and they've started as well so they came on I think it rained on Wednesday whatever but anyway well then they came on Thursday and we
F	oh I know we had that
B	yes it it's like er
F	we had that on the roof of the porch in
B	like double skinned and
C	yeah and it's got these ridges
B	tubes
F	between yeah exactly
B	yeah mm
C	so they tried to convince me to use that and I was almost
F	yes the other is opaque
B	yes that's it's opaque
F	yeah
B	and it's but it's more for erm
F	it's more for insulation
B	erm
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	which you really don't need out there
C	it's not really relevant there
B	no
C	exactly anyway I don't know have any idea what the erm
B	yes probably
F	yeah exactly
B	it is yeah
C	so they were quite keen that I should use that but I said no so anyway so it got delivered first thing this morning but it rained all morning and then they came I believe at about two and started in there halfway up they started at the front and they're halfway up so they haven't finished erm but they've got past the washing rack which means I can put the washing rack back up tomorrow
F	oh right
C	I was thinking
F	right
C	erm and I'm assuming they won't come back tomorrow I'm assuming they'll come back Monday
F	oh who's doing it? which particular people?
C	er yeah no the well the three of them that were here to begin with actually
F	the same?
C	yeah those three
F	really?
C	again
F	oh right
C	yeah yeah erm and as you said they've taken away the stuff from the front door and the other stuff er extra insulation that was
F	they did do that did they?
C	there they've taken
F	so is the door still not shutting properly?
C	well it's not locking yeah
F	oh right I didn't know about the
C	yeah so they haven't done that unless they did it today but I don't think so
F	yes
C	by the downpipe
F	yes yeah yeah
C	erm that's not their problem obviously but erm there were some electric cables that are kind of floating around now with nothing to be attached to they must have used to it being inside that so I've asked them to cable clip those to the wall so they're out of the way
F	they were meant to be finishing off something there weren't they?
B	somehow joining the two
C	yeah
B	the the it's was the corner of the
C	oh I don't think I thought it was their job to do that to be honest
B	the they were going to join the two together
C	were they?
B	yes yes
C	oh okay
B	and they agreed to do that yes yes
C	oh okay I'll speak to them about that then cos I didn't know that that had been agreed
B	yes
C	erm
F	will you see er would you be here on Monday?
C	yeah yeah I'm away from home on Monday erm
F	right
C	so yeah and then he also came back to do the roof erm to do the tiles on the roof
F	oh right
B	oh I see right
F	with all the scaffolding
C	erm yeah yeah obviously cos he knew
F	oh right
C	he needed to do it before the scaffolding went and I think I got the impression that I don't know what you'd done but
F	oh right cos you found round about one round about
B	well a broken one yes yeah
C	yeah and there was an unbroken one which I was
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
F	fine
C	mm
F	and have you er have you paid him now?
C	for the painting yes
B	yeah no I'm alright I've still got some more beer thanks
C	erm yes I paid them for the painting
F	and the other lot haven't brought another
C	no no no no no no they've sent a receipt for the first payment
F	I mean they shouldn't because it's not finished
C	no exactly
F	uhu
C	so erm
F	so are you going to?
C	and I've seen
F	but you see he rang I don't know why
C	yeah I dunno he didn't ring me that day might he might have been ringing to tell me that he wasn't that
F	made a mistake maybe
C	that the scaffold wasn't coming or whatever or wasn't coming down or whatever yes so I mean we are getting there it's frustrating that the passageway isn't completed for the weekend but as I say actually if I can get the washing line thing back up then moving
F	well yes
C	the fridge in is not particularly traumatic
F	tomorrow erm
C	or the freezer
F	and the next day
C	mm
F	so I mean you could even put the airer out couldn't you on the concrete there
C	well
F	with some of the washing
C	I can use the washing line though it's not it's not like I've got lots they didn't
F	no
C	they only wore one set of clothes
F	right
C	yeah
F	right yes
C	just the
F	what about
C	so that should be fine that should
F	the tents? do they have to be packed away away
C	mm no tents
F	sorry yes
C	yeah
F	that's a bonus really not having a tent to dry out
C	yeah well
A	but yeah I could have
F	well he seemed to
A	brought a sleeping bag and everything else would have fitted into my pockets
F	ah
C	and even the knife that you had in your pocket you lost so yes
A	yeah
C	exactly
F	oh
F	right
C	you were self contained
F	okay
C	yeah
F	right
C	erm it's amazing how long it burns for the blue stuff isn't it?
A	mm I like that
C	yeah
F	so erm and er
C	yes
F	oh yes no I have
C	oh it's
F	coming to us on Thursday
C	I don't know why I thought it was Thursday she was coming to me
F	so
C	are you sure mum?
F	I had the money there

F	he sounds remarkably good I had had an email from
C	no
F	he thinks the clocks shouldn't change like you
B	he should he
C	and me
B	he should just get up earlier in the morning and then he'd have the day
F	yes
B	rather than just the afternoon
C	that's how
B	yes
C	oh is is he actually a late riser?
F	oh gosh yes
C	oh I didn't know that that's has he always been a late riser?
F	yeah
C	oh how interesting yes well most people as they age anyway sort of sleep less but he's a
F	yes
C	late riser
F	yeah but he doesn't go to bed till very late cos he talks see he pefers to watching Sky News at midnight or something
C	oh golly right he's a late night person
F	yeah
C	mm
F	he kind of he has to but I mean eighty after all he's eighty-six
C	yeah he can do what he wants
F	so absolutely
C	er well I'm with him on the hour changing
F	yes I said we all are
F	and he was
C	yeah
F	said so you know we had an experiment in
F	and we were all very pleased about it
F	but Scotland wasn't
C	one of the boys asked me
B	it was Scotland that
C	the other day who what it was who first brought it in I said well that was a man called Willett funnily enough I had noticed because I went to primary school at
F	oh
C	oh I don't know what happened to her after primary school but I can remember her name and I remember her saying her grandfather was the first to through this through Parliament that initially in the twenties or whatever and not long ago I came across an article about it and it referred to this bloke whose surname was
A	really?
C	yes
C	it wasn't
F	it's funny the things you remember
C	yeah exactly yeah
F	yes
C	I've got no idea whatever else came of that girl
F	gosh yeah
C	yeah
F	funny
C	and at the time I didn't know to criticise her grandfather as much as I would do now
A	the only star I recognise here is is
F	er yes er
C	yeah he is fine
F	er yes I mean you know we just talk
C	yeah
F	erm I think perhaps with the amount of attention it was getting maybe I didn't realise cos I haven't he'd probably seen three news by the time I spoke to him this evening
C	yeah
F	you know I had no idea what was going on
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
F	then I realised what it was
B	mm
F	erm yes he do er he's got
C	right I was going to say the children the because there were just always children there aren't there?
F	there's really always somebody there there is always one or other or for a long time now
C	was she just staying down there is she?
F	oh she's been down there she stays down there for months on end now
C	what does she do?
F	and
C	yes
F	but she's actually she says she's enjoying
C	do you think she?
F	but I mean he he does go back to
C	right
F	and then
F	sorry?
B	there's been the odd occasion when he has been on his own but it's er
F	no but not for
B	more than a week or so
C	a year or more
B	mm
C	but
F	yeah
C	what does
F	I don't know
C	the do you think she just drinks?
F	she just what?
C	drinks?
F	oh I hope not
C	yeah so do I
F	oh
C	wouldn't he? okay
F	no no no
C	maybe she just cooks
F	I don't know if she still smokes
C	goes for long walks just so so he doesn't notice smoking
F	no I think
C	maybe she cooks some things I can't imagine I just kind of want
F	it's really hard
C	to sort of picture
F	I wouldn't know cos I mean I don't have conversations with anyway when er
C	no
F	the only time I might get
C	yeah
F	when she answers or or she'll send an email but no well we'd know more about
C	right
C	yes
F	only this year
C	yes
F	yeah and she'd been marching
C	marching against that
F	and I I I mean I
C	well I
F	yeah
C	to us? the mm
F	and then the other thing is a wind farm that she's been very active in
C	pro or against?
F	protesting against
C	against why are people against wind farms?
F	which is in in her area
C	yes
F	which is a very flat boggy godforsaken area
F	and er
C	a wind farm could only improve it
F	no honestly really
C	because given that
F	really
C	wind farms improve everywhere
F	really really
B	I don't understand this business about
F	no
B	wind farms
F	anyway anyway
C	what about people liking them or not liking them?
B	well not liking them I mean okay initially they're there but once they've been there a few weeks you don't you don't notice them anymore
F	yeah but you would notice it
C	oh I think they're rather beautiful
F	the thing about this particular one
B	why is it they won't paint them grey or green or blue? why must they always be white so they stand out?
B	if the if if they'd you know that that's
B	less shiny colour
B	every every one you see is white and it reflects the light
F	you know some of these really big
A	there is probably
C	probably there might be a reason so that birds don't like fly into them
B	well there might be reason
C	or something cos like one of the issues with wind turbines is about birds flying into them and bats there's an issue about bats
F	see this particular wind farm is quite interesting
A	there would be an issue about bats
F	cos it's massive
C	mm
A	cos they're moving
C	yeah
A	so it'll
C	yes and er one I worked with years and years ago the bat thing was a really big deal yeah sorry mum
A	did they fix that?
C	er they didn't they had to make the case and I think the case has now been won that yeah more bats do die but er you just have live with this sort of thing erm
A	yeah you can make a cage
C	no no a case not a cage
A	could make
C	you could make cage
A	yeah I'm thinking
C	but I think you'd have to know that bats were erm
B	but bats are so small the cage the wires would have to be
C	really fine
B	and then the wind would be
A	and they would
C	yeah
B	diffused
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I
F	oh no
C	mm
F	so she's
C	mm
F	the proposal in in this flat bog area
F	and and the thing is that
C	yeah
F	yeah that's one of the things but then the other interesting thing is that Ireland doesn't benefit directly from the power the power is actually being piped back over there
C	yeah but that's also true of any any energy that we create here in the UK exactly the same happens so when they say that we'll have nuclear power and then it'll make energy cheaper it isn't true it goes into the European wide grid and er and
F	yes
C	and then it does comes out a different way so it's not like we control our power either and that is unfortunate
F	so
C	because I think local control of power would be a really good thing but
F	well
C	it doesn't happen yeah
F	er for people in that part of the country er that they're not even going to have the power themselves
C	but I stood under a wind turbine a while ago and I don't remember it making any noise at all but I know they say
A	it's quite difficult to build out at sea
C	well it's more difficult to build out at sea and then one of the real problems with energy is the how much is lost in the transmission
A	mm
C	right that's when the modes of transmission and stuff but also apparently if you've got this
F	oh right yes
C	I mean you can sort of picture it it might vibrate and
F	oh okay
C	yeah exactly
F	oh yeah you can imagine
C	yeah exactly yeah god it's just
F	no
C	easy answer to all of this
F	no no
C	there's just no easy answer
F	no it's true yeah anyway
C	but at least now we know what
F	no
C	his whole life so we don't need to worry about not knowing now
F	no but
C	oh there you go excellent
F	apparently
C	at some stage okay
F	somewhere in his life
C	okay
F	and when they went back to Sweden they asked him to go over and visit
C	okay
F	but
C	yes
F	erm yeah
C	you see
F	well he does certainly doesn't use it but
C	no
F	no no no but they would show him stuff
C	yes yeah yeah good
F	but I think no we're not to pretend that he has
B	I
C	cos he watches Sky news
F	yeah but I knew that on the
B	he's certainly got Sky
C	that's the telly thing though that's not an internet thing
B	no it isn't
F	on the television isn't it?
B	yes but
F	I mean they certainly have
B	they've got broadband you see
F	they have broadband because they had that put in when
B	yeah
F	so that
B	but then oh no is it O2 the broadband? cos didn't he talk about the telephone man? having conversations with the telephone man or something?
F	oh I don't remember that
B	I remember it was being put in
F	no it was
B	oh was it? oh was it
F	but I don't know what sort of thing complicated yeah
F	I don't know
C	I saw
F	did you?
C	yeah
F	oh nice
F	erm
C	I think it was nice yes
C	well so has she been to Ireland?
F	yes
C	er I I knew that and obviously I knew she'd been in Germany
F	and Portugal
C	oh I missed that what did what did they do in Portugal?
F	erm golf
C	er well
F	yeah
C	were both there?
F	yeah oh yes that's right
C	right okay cos when you said
F	no
C	right okay right yeah
F	no no but I mean I haven't actually seen
C	oh okay
F	you know I haven't had a conversation with
C	yeah yeah they seemed okay yeah yeah
F	yes? you
C	yeah fine
F	actually had an evening together did you?
C	yeah yeah
F	oh how lovely
C	yeah
F	well that's great
C	yeah
F	did they come to you?
C	no I went over there
F	oh right erm it's well we popped a card in for
C	oh it's her birthday tomorrow yes
F	early yesterday erm I didn't know what what to get er what well as life goes by I think you know only time I think of what to give
C	oh that place where
F	well yes
C	not actually where
F	yes
C	yes
F	which is near not the sort of place I would be going into
C	I went in once did I tell you that? when it was somewhere else and it was you who told me it was the same place
F	yes
C	just moved
F	yeah
C	yeah which does make sense
F	erm yeah so I thought that was handy because
C	you could buy some really posh artificial flowers in there
F	er sorry?
C	she could buy some really posh artificial flowers in there
F	yes and candles and things so I went in today with
C	mm
F	to have an idea of you know and then and then we worked out and then I went to and and they don't do
C	tokens
F	I doubt
C	well no but it's a great thing for him to say if er er yeah if yeah how funny
F	well no I suppose I mean I I
C	most places do these days
F	and I came out I would have thought anywhere wouldn't you?
C	well I dunno
F	well just about
C	erm
F	anywhere will give you a a voucher nowadays
C	yeah but it's funny cos actually furniture shops are the sort of place that wouldn't would you expect to get one from?
F	ah well
C	cos things are too expensive in a
F	they
C	voucher for
F	it it's not just furniture it's
C	no I know exactly it isn't but it which is why it would be yeah
F	yes they've got stuff
B	well cos you get one in
C	that was
B	for
C	that was the example I was trying to er think of
B	I remember
F	oh yes you could for
C	could you?
F	well I
B	well we don't know we've never asked have we?
C	er well you'd never use a voucher when back when those places only sold carpets and furniture there wouldn't be vouchers but as you say
F	oh no
C	these days they sell vases and mats
F	other stuff
C	and mirrors and stuff yeah
B	definitely yes yeah
F	so it should
F	so tell me is it something special would we know? we wouldn't
C	well given our accumulated knowledge of watches
F	yes
C	that we've now established is
C	although I was trying to remember it earlier cos
F	oh yes
C	cos that's
B	that's right the sweep er yeah
C	that's that's that's very important yes
F	yes yes
C	but anyway she was very pleased with it and er er and so she gave me her old watch
F	the white one?
C	no not the white one the a a metal one a
F	oh right
C	you'd know it if you saw it erm
F	maybe I
C	but she hasn't worn the white one I don't think for some years cos I could picture the white one
F	yeah because I mean
C	well I don't remember her talking about I don't think I ever engaged in these sorts of conversations anyway so I dropped it off today at the shop to
F	what it needs something
C	it needs both a battery and some links taken out
F	right
C	so I
F	right
C	so I've dropped it in the shop to have a battery and links taken out
F	right and who did you take it to?
C	I took it to well first of all I took it cos I was coming up
F	well done yes
C	yeah he just he just
F	didn't feel right
C	I
F	which one was that love?
C	so next to the YMCA so you've got Greggs and the YMCA whatever it is now and there's there's a
F	I thought you said
C	no it was at the top of
F	where are we now?
B	oh you mean H Samuel's?
F	is that what it's called?
B	yeah
C	no opposite Woolworths or
B	yeah yeah Samuel's
F	yes well
B	the the chain
F	well one part of it is Jones and one part of it's H Samuel for some odd reason don't ask me why
C	oh no I didn't notice it was like attached to another thing
F	yeah I know I know
B	yeah yeah
B	that's that's
F	they've always been joined
C	and it said under whatever its name is
F	yeah
C	watch
C	on on the corner opposite
F	oh right and you had to be let in
C	yeah
F	mm
C	yeah but they looked like they knew what they were talking about and they have a chap who comes and
F	I hope they're not going to charge you a fortune
C	well no the bloke's gonna come and he'll do it all but I mean it's gonna cost eighty quid but that's what you expect it to cost so if they've got to open and reseal I think but the question is can they do it there or does it have to go away? and their man comes in once a week and he'll come and either come in or
F	right okay well you must be walking through watches now
C	well not really cos I've got this one
F	mm
C	but now that I've got into wearing a watch I quite wanted a a nice watch and I was saying this to
F	oh
C	which is very nice
F	oh right I shall look forward to seeing it yes
C	so I don't have any cos
F	yes
C	he didn't wear it to camp
F	no I know he wanted to wear it
C	cos could er when he got back
F	to camp yes but he told me he wasn't wearing it
C	yeah exactly
F	mm yeah
C	and it's er yeah I'm sort of
F	yes
C	it's funny how we're
F	erm
C	reverting in life
F	and erm
C	hello
B	oh
C	oh I didn't hear any tale of what these were like
D	they're like salted
F	I don't think you liked them
C	they're salty did you say?
A	they're salty yeah salted liquorish
C	they're salted liquorish have you heard that
B	yes I have
C	do you want to stop that now cos we must have been going for hours
A	one hour and five minutes
C	oh well
B	no
C	it's salted liquorish
B	I I I'd rather not
F	no he doesn't like salted
C	oh no okay fair enough
