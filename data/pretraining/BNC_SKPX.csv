A	yeah
B	what's the score?
A	I don't know
B	oh so it was  it was  a pretty spectacular
A	I don't even know what the I don't even know what this game is though like is it the League Cup or something? I don't know even know what the League Cup is
B	league Cup semi-final? Cardiff versus Crystal Palace?
A	I didn't even but what? Like
B	eh that was the League Cup I think the Coca Cola was the league one then
A	so what is the difference?
B	was always F A wasn't it?
A	was it?
B	well
A	is it not the something FA Cup like they sort of
B	well maybe but you don't sort of need to say that do you?
A	I don't know
B	for those that
A	yeah
B	eh what's a wind screen? Yeah the I mean but em
A	anyway
B	but also wind screens one or whatever it was I think that was like the
A	there's the
B	wasn't there a Leyland DAF Cup or something?
A	Don't be silly there wasn't a Leyland DAF Cup was there?
B	I don't know
A	I'd like it if there was
B	well they
A	and
B	they do that in you know in snooker don't have the Embassy snooker
A	oh is that where that comes from?
B	eh
A	that just shows my ignorance
B	eh and of course eh
A	oh there look the Carling Cup
B	and of course eh Formula One is is famous for eh
A	there look Middlesbrough's first and all the
B	when when was that? A hundred and twenty-eight years ago
A	probably
B	eh
A	that Steve McClaren that's a
B	just about yeah I think they were actually oh
A	oh yeah you did
B	topping of the shocks this but this is that was a section of the top of the
A	so
B	beating eh
A	Arsenal yeah
B	Arsenal in the  in the  League Cup
A	but like
B	which ranks after the FA Cup but I think the there was an
A	more rubbish
B	but I think that was the one that I think Birmingham won a while ago
A	I don't know
B	where you
A	I've not seen I'm not up to date
B	where you  you only entered it if you're like the em one of the lower like if you're in then the third division or below
A	I think I was put off of football like for life after that whole like working at the Stadium of Light thing
B	oh eh
A	I had the pies the pie aspect
B	yeah but that was
A	it was a bit of
B	enterprising you know I mean it was industrious like you were
A	I don't know if it was enterprising
B	you were  working that age
A	em well you were supposed to be sixteen but I wasn't sixteen I just said I was and like they weren't bothered
B	yeah best  Yeah best  left unsolved
A	like the pies
B	yeah
A	like if they didn't sell them they used to just put them in a box and then put them in a cupboard and then the next week just like crack the pies back out and the put them in the warmer
B	that's scandalous
A	and be like
B	yeah
A	because if somebody got like a em like a bad belly from eating a dodgy pie you would never know because like I suppose a lot of the blokes and that who go to football and eat those horrible pies like would have had twenty pints of beer anyway
B	yeah
A	that was a bad pie
B	yeah I think there wasn't probably much in the pies apart from
A	no
B	sort of potatoes butter or
A	like sawdust and like
A	and hooves in that
B	I never  I never  had a I I never went to a football match
A	oh we need to rectify that
B	what are they like?
A	well there's the the
B	is it just like the ones you get in the chippie?
A	em yeah more or less
B	oh yeah
A	everyone was like chicken tikka pie? Why do I want one of them? Like cos people used to just be like give us a pie love
B	yeah
A	it didn't those didn't really sell very well
B	well in the chippie you know it used to be steak and kidney or eh
A	yeah
A	ah kidneys
B	rump steak and you have a a
A	eh
B	cheese cheese and onion pie but eh if you
A	oh yeah cheese and onion pie
B	and then there's Cornish pasty  Cornish pasty  which is mainly potatoes in a cut in squares or cubes I should
A	I remember when I first
B	eh with peas and a very small amount of mince
A	oh yeah
B	yeah really loads of like I guess this white mainly white pepper but also
A	I don't know
B	they are very like quite quite hot aren't they?
A	yeah
B	but not like chilli hot sort of pepper hot

B	oh yeah
A	come on I'm not that old
B	oh I don't don't know eh
A	no
B	em
A	to be fair
B	oh yes so eh
A	the football
B	gonna say another
A	yeah
B	the Formula One was on
A	oh yeah Formula One loads
B	was heavily eh
A	do you think they'll ban like?
B	heavily sponsored by eh
A	do you think they'll ever ban like McDonald's sponsoring things?
B	em
A	you know because they've they've banned cigarettes or like you know alcohol?
B	no because McDonald's are sneaky
A	I suppose
B	although I haven't been to McDonald's for a very long time so
A	I haven't
B	oh yeah
A	and I couldn't get it off
B	oh that that was just a really bad moment wasn't it em?
A	it was funny
B	so just kicking off the second half eh Cardiff one
A	oh it is
B	Crystal Palace nil
B	ah no I'm not actually gonna  I'm not actually gonna  commentate the whole match
A	I don't think I'd like to be a sports commentator
B	well well I
A	you could just make up names for them
B	em I could just say the teams where Cardiff has it's a list of
A	yeah but it's
B	yeah
A	I I like the which which kit do you prefer?
B	oh Cardiff
B	that's a
A	I like that sort of yellowy bananay canary colour
B	yeah well I think that some of the kits that they have em could be more  could be more  extravagant I suppose em
A	yeah
B	but they must think that it's eh that's it's off-putting or something to have
A	yeah like highler
B	really bright sort of
A	I'm
B	pink kits so I don't  I don't  know any
A	I'm sure that someone's
B	teams that have a pink kit
A	I'm sure someone's got like a purpley pink
B	em I don't know
A	maybe it wasn't them
B	I think Northampton Town has purple
A	oh do they?
B	but eh
A	oh that would be good
B	eh
A	also I think like
B	there should be more I suppose but
A	there's a lot of stripes on the goal
B	yeah I don't know they don't really have spotty ones do they?
A	you know like jockeys have?
B	but I think that would be like sort of distracting with the  with the  ball wouldn't it?
A	or like some chevrons?
B	eh
A	or like em
B	animal patterns or flame flame patterns like eh
A	like a leopard print?
B	yeah I suppose you could but
A	like a zebra?
B	oh yeah cos if they had names like the
A	oh yeah that's a good idea
B	yeah so kind of like
A	like rugby league does that though don't they?
B	like the cowboys and and the indians or something I wonder
A	yeah
B	like the
A	well I saw like you know  you know  I've been knitting stuff and that at the minute
B	yeah?
A	for a the baby
B	yeah
A	but it looked like a baby tuxedo like a dicky bow tie and like a white shirt with like buttons and like a cumberband and then like a jacket
B	blimey
A	but it was a jumper
B	em you know people dress sort of babies in that sort of
A	yeah
B	thing nowadays don't they?
A	eh I'm not sure if they dress them in knitted dinner jackets
B	well
A	that's going to be a bit of a niche audience
B	eh
A	but they dress them as like big pumpkins and stuff don't they on Halloween?
B	I can see how eh you know you might want to
A	yeah
B	you for clothes like you could imitate things like couldn't you? Sort of imitate like like a football kit
A	yeah you could
B	eh
A	could do
B	I don't know if I've seen that
A	maybe maybe there is
A	Cos it they're all a horrible sort of nylon aren't they? Is it nylon?
B	for
B	for for eh Southampton or?
A	not Southampton
B	I mean
A	like you know like jockeys have?
B	eh
A	like where they have like
B	well they have yeah they have more crazy
A	like hoops and
B	eh colours it's like yeah
A	and like you know like even rugby does like even rugby has the the kind of
B	all  harlequins and
A	the harlequin thing
B	I like  I like  there one it's got sort of
A	and like the em hoops and stuff don't they?
B	yeah
A	although
B	yeah and Celtic
A	oh yeah
B	em
A	that's probably about the
B	there is too much
A	limits of my footballing knowledge
B	too much just red white red white
A	nothing wrong with red and white
B	yeah well sport is good to watch eh especially in the pub em where
A	yeah
B	but also
A	I think so
B	and and sort of
A	like when that time when we got really into the curling?
B	huh that was it was watchable you see you can
A	yeah
B	when the
A	are you looking forward to the Olympics?
B	em
A	yeah?
B	I suppose you can't just turn up and then just go in and watch it
A	well
B	yeah
A	all the outdoor ones like the road races but no
B	no
A	I even applied for like the most rubbish things like the tiddlywinks or like the you know
B	eh they don't do tiddlywinks do they?
A	no
B	but em
A	no I didn't get any tickets but em
B	but they do do some strange things like like archery
A	beach volleyball in London
B	yeah
A	it's going to be an interesting one
B	yeah em
A	I quite liked the swimming ones last time
B	cycling eh
A	oh yeah
B	well it's very quick
A	it's a bit sort of murgh sort of everyone likes it but I don't know
B	do they?
A	well that's like the most expensive tickets are for that
B	how much would it cost just to watch the men's hundred metre final?
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	for some of them
B	ooh there's Chris Martin?
A	who's Chris Martin?
B	he plays for Crystal Palace
A	did
B	no it's cos he
A	oh Chris Martin? Chris Martin
B	he's he's em
A	oh he's having a break?
B	he eh he used to be  used to be  a singer didn't he?
B	yeah
A	well
B	yeah
A	stand with like Apple and Moses or whatever his kids are called
B	apple and Moses?
A	yeah
B	oh is he going through the Bible? Then the next thing he's going to be like
A	oh you mean Apple
B	den or something
A	den?

A	oh right
B	apple from Adam and Eve that apple
A	yeah
B	Moses from the Moses
A	the story of Moses
B	Moses' adventures and em
B	no
A	well he didn't have
B	he was planning to go all the way to I don't know
A	I don't know if Apple was a very  was a very  standard choice
B	I think Apple is I can see why
A	maybe he could have gone for
B	I can see it's
A	like what? Like pawpaw?
B	well it's better than
A	Mango Martin's got a nice ring to it
B	eh banana
A	Mango Martin
B	it's it's man and go isn't it so? It's you know

A	mushroom? Mushroom Martin? That's quite nice
B	eh yeah his name would be  would be  magic wouldn't it?
A	oh yeah
B	em

B	em
A	what do you think?
B	eh there's a lot of things around Moses aren't there so? You've got the Ten Commandments haven't you and eh
A	I don't know if commandment would be a nice name for a person
