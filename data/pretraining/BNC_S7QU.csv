A	right so um
B	so did we decide that those bigger seeds were were pumpkin seeds on the bread?
A	uh no uh I dunno actually they were some funny colour they were like um they were like browny green or or almost but uh I didn't know what that was um but uh I've
B	I've eaten them often yeah
A	actually I've seen pumpkin seeds that when we took them out at Halloween
B	yeah
A	uh had the
B	they may turn green of course
A	I dunno so I don't I I dunno but um
B	I've seen them many times but I've eaten them many times but I don't know what they are
A	so I never thought of growing a pumpkin but uh I guess they'd be good
B	I think I might
A	no
B	we've been cultivating it for years
A	oh right you actually put sort of like a
B	it's turned into the most wonderful soft light soil
A	alright so it does work then it's not just a  not just a  joke
B	yeah it works yeah
A	oh right
A	it sort of
B	so we've got this wonderful light really soft light soil cos it's full of worms if you look in it it's disgusting
A	yeah well I'm I'm sure it's disgusting I mean I would expect compost to cos they they smell quite bad don't they
B	yeah
A	because uh I suppose they attract they do attract sort of flies and things and uh maybe uh wasps or something but uh
B	they attract flies yeah they do
A	but but when but it is a way of
B	oh yeah
A	yeah so sort of a substantial
B	and um so what I'm going to do is when the weather's a bit warmer I'm going to um dig it into those two the terrace beds at the bottom and uh for my veg
A	oh yeah right so you're gonna
B	yeah
A	yeah um
B	no we haven't
A	um
B	you would if you grew them
A	the yeah I mean it's one of those things we have to think about uh what is sort what's gonna save us money what what will we actually cos it's all very well growing you know ten um
B	yes
A	well we had a cucumber one that saved us sort of you know fifty P each cucumber you know so
B	at least
A	but um
B	mm
A	and things we we eat a lot of uh carrots and potatoes but
B	yes
A	well there is a problem cos of course you you can't really match the kinds of demand that you have you know you buy a bag of potatoes every week uh but it'd be hard to grow that many
B	yeah
A	I see yeah
B	so and then in that bed I'm going to grow onions red onions
A	oh right yeah
B	um and white onions
A	that'll be good
B	we we might we're getting a greenhouse as well
A	oh so sort of six by six so
B	I don't know
A	two by  two by  two metres? No
B	Cos you then you need a big space between each of them
A	is it? Oh yeah
B	yeah
A	uh the the um the individual tree sprouted the whatever they call them the individual sprouts of it were sort of growing at different rates so you'd have bits sticking out uh certain clumps sticking out and other bits holding back and then it was going off and also it was getting eaten by a variety of things
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	remember that that programme you know with the
B	yes
A	but it's a question of
B	about shooting and getting them in the pots to start with
A	yeah I mean
B	uh eight by
A	yeah
B	pends how much space there is
A	so you can then you can get lemons cos I've got a load of lemons over there but they they seem to have uh
B	grape vine
A	oh yeah yeah we'll we've got one in the cemetery isn't there?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	um yes you get a lot of concentrated sun in that one corner
A	you could've
B	yeah
A	well there's two
B	can anybody pick it? Are they
A	but yeah so I don't know if it has to go inside but I suppose it doesn't matter I mean
B	if you've got plenty of sun on it
A	yeah
B	the south
A	yeah
B	we could
A	yeah
B	it does get very hot yeah
A	oh yeah you'd probably do better at planting in your your front garden that's really hot
B	so what we could do we could put some tomatoes there if they were or we could put um sweet peas or something
A	yeah
B	but um if it's far too hot in the front garden which it quite often is you you can go to the back because after eleven o'clock you get the shade from the house
A	yeah yeah
B	of the space yes
A	you know in I saw a thing in uh central London where they they have all kinds of innovative sort of garden techniques you know there there was mushroom growers you see um
B	outdoors?
A	they they do
B	Peter and Ann used to make them in the  in the  cellar
A	Peter and Ann?
B	yeah
A	oh Mott? Yeah yeah yeah
B	so you could make them
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I mean I I uh I'll make a pie I'll make a tart that'll be nice and uh I might um make some damson wine or something
A	I was just thinking actually some some of the things uh back to um your fungus again um some types of fungus are very um valuable aren't they? Famously truffles are valuable aren't they?
B	truffles? Are they the ones that grow on the tree?
A	no truffles don't grow on trees
B	oh there's a stake
A	oh yeah you mean fungus that grows on the side of a tree? Uh yeah no um
B	I don't think I've ever eaten them actually
A	with you need to I think they're they're supposed to get Italian truffles and specifically the greatest most expensive truffles presumably come from a particular region of Italy like I dunno um uh
B	yes
A	um it's this region in north of Italy anyway um
B	yes they do
A	but anyway yeah so if you had a cellar or someone had a cellar you can just turn uh a boring cellar into you know somewhere that you could
B	it'd be good
A	right
B	oh I tell you why
A	yeah
B	cut the tree right back
A	yeah
B	yes
A	um cos that's the hard part uh well one of the hard parts of making um cider from apples is is um is that you need to filter to press them and filter them
B	is to
A	um
B	get juice yeah
A	um
B	D'you peel them?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	although uh yeah I think so because I think the sometimes the skin doesn't have
B	yes I'm not sure what they do
A	we made a little bit of cider uh
B	oh the skin has the healthy bits in it the the um
A	oh no I mean the the bits for the cider
B	I would make cider vinegar if I was doing it
A	yeah well we did cos we left it too long you see cos it starts off as cider and then if you leave it it turns into vinegar
B	oh
A	we made cider vinegar yeah
B	did you? I didn't know about that
A	it's quite easy actually
B	sieve
A	yeah we basically um sort of uh blended them or chopped them
B	yeah
A	A blender would be very useful or some kind of big blender
B	yes and then you you can leave it to
A	yeah you gotta peel and core them yeah peel and core them blend them or yeah some way find some way of blending them then then this is the hard bit you've gotta press and filter it you know you've got the
B	yes
A	we left it in a bottle with a sort of we tied some muslin over the top of it
A	Cos the the yeast is in the um air
B	oh
A	we didn't add any yeast
B	mm
A	oh well uh what um
B	our aloe's grown really well
A	yeah the
A	that's connected to it
B	yeah
A	oh yeah I've seen that on uh Wikipedia yeah there's loads of uh loads of chemicals in there isn't there? Yeah
B	A garlic loads of them
A	yeah based on
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
B	getting as oh that's amazing
A	that's an accidental discovery isn't it uh as opposed to um
B	yeah
A	well I dunno I mean different yeah
B	everything
A	but it has sometimes in some ways it's good because uh it's got the
B	yes
A	uh it has an effect of getting rid of um you know the dangerous free radicals in the blood but also uh it has certain other
B	yes
A	depending on you know various things but
B	overconsumption uh like they say
A	yeah I think yeah for some things like tea I think prevent uh absorption of some tea prevents absorption of some other stuff like iron but it depends on a lot uh I guess it's complicated though so
B	oh does it? Yes
A	I mean um
B	I hadn't read that
A	I mean I uh yeah
B	it has got anti-oxidants to
A	and yeah and some some it's like with the cancer studies often you get you say that this some study will say that it's that it helps against cancer but another study will say that it can actually make can actually have no effect or can actually increase the chance of cancer and there's a lot of complicated uh things about that and these sorts of things take a long time cos you have to do loads and loads of experiments I suppose
B	yeah
A	um it
B	oh well that's the one that's uh
A	well no I mean the I I think it's
B	it's just
A	oh yeah I think the
B	stomach bleeding yeah
A	and that
B	we don't know
