C	yeah on his shoulder
A	tore through his leathers didn't it?
C	goes through yeah
A	it certainly does
C	did they do a skin graft for that or did it just grow back?

C	oh is it a Gopro?
B	yeah
A	is that so he can record if someone doesn't treat him right?
B	basically yeah
C	well it's not just that if you're if you're cycling over you know you and there's a nice view and you want to capture it but you're cycling and does it take a video or a
B	it's a
C	a snapshot?
B	it's a video camera but it it Gopro's are designed for like extreme sports so like snowboarders sometimes attach them to like their helmets or
C	mm
B	or or skiers or
C	I wonder how long it it films for though that?
A	I didn't see him turn it on did you?
C	no I was just thinking you wouldn't want to go to the toilet and have it
A	I know you'd have to turn it off wouldn't you?
A	before you
C	went to the
B	had to having a wee yeah
A	it's weird
B	have you filled up?

C	they definitely had it in the supermarket didn't they? in the big supermarket
A	oh look where he's filling is water bottle up from
C	oh I wouldn't do that
A	I don't think I would he obviously thinks it's alright
C	you don't want to be cycling and have an upset tummy do you?
A	blooming heck
C	not a good idea Mr Gopro
A	so do you physically turn it on and off
B	I I've never had one mum so I couldn't tell you
A	cos he just set off cycling then didn't he?
C	mm
D	erm
