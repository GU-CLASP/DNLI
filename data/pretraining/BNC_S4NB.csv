B	it should be in a minute
C	I tried to be very good at lunchtime in fact I I was very good at lunchtime cos when I know I'm eating big in the evening
B	yeah
A	mm
C	then I try and compensate for it during the day so like today I was eating peaches I had a peach

B	mm
C	that close and erm I was eating my lunch and oh and she'd said to me earlier have you got any lunch that you can share? cos she's on a on a healthy eating not a diet a healthy eating spree
A	mm
C	so she'd brought salad with her and I said yeah you can have some of this frittata oh what's that she said I so I said it's like an omelette
A	mm
C	so I just had it cold and actually
C	and I said you'll like it
C	you'll like this it's sort of like salami and
A	mm
C	potato and
A	oh no

A	oh no
B	oh no
C	it was disgusting it really was awful so I've only had
A	you're a bad mother
C	a
C	I've only had a very small amount of lunch and then another peach this afternoon and I had some cottage cheese when I got home but

C	I'm quite disgusting I'll put some HP Sauce

A	HP Sauce?

B	I put cayenne pepper
A	yeah
B	I put a bit if cayenne pepper on mine

B	or a bit of black pepper if I don't have cayenne like one of the two but
C	yeah
B	brown sauce?
C	yeah
B	really?
C	yeah but it's all spices isn't it?
B	yeah it is yeah that's true yeah
A	mm

C	it's got that sweetness as well
B	yeah
C	and you have cottage cheese with pineapple don't you?
B	oh yeah yeah I suppose yeah
C	that's
A	mm
C	and I would normally just sort of stir it in very gently but I was quite disgusting really and I just squirt a little bit in the top of the of the pot and I thought well I'll just eat the top bit the top layer with the brown sauce on or I'll just get up and go and get back into the kitchen and get the
C	oh that's all I'll have oh I'll just go and do it again
C	about four times I went back to the
A	mm
C	you start with the best intentions don't you?
B	mm
A	that's what I thought with a tub of Ben and Jerry's the other day
C	yeah
A	I thought I'll just have a little bit
C	minus the brown sauce
A	yeah minus some brown sauce yeah
B	oh
A	I thought just have a bit and
B	what flavour was it?
A	the only one we had left it oh was a Chocolate Fudge Brownie one
B	oh that's nice
C	yeah
A	we always have Chocolate Fudge Brownie Cookie Dough which is my favourite
C	mm
A	er then the Karma Karamel Sutra
B	I like Phish Food
C	oh yeah
B	I like that
A	or Caramel Chew Chew
B	that's a good one too
C	and what's the one with the little white polar bears in it?
B	there's a peanut butter one I like but no I don't know that one
A	I don't know oh we tried that peanut butter one it was just too sickly
B	did you not like it?
A	didn't like it no
B	oh you see I'm a peanut butter fan so
A	we tried some different ones
C	I love peanut butter but I don't actually like ice cream very much
A	I think
C	don't hate me
A	no no no
C	yeah
A	I've got a friend that eats ice cream every single day literally every day
A	and there's something wrong if she doesn't so
B	really?
A	yeah every day
C	I like cheap ice cream van Mr Whippy ice cream
A	oh I like that
B	yeah yeah
A	takes you back to being a kid doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	when you used to hear it going round the roads all around the back
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you'd be thinking mum mum mum
C	yeah
B	and you're
C	and it was only too late in life that I heard that the hint about telling your children when they play and the ice cream man plays music it's
A	yeah it's really
B	yeah
A	oh my mum was great she used to give us a
C	it's
A	er when if it was a Sunday she'd give us a bowl and we used to take it out and say can you fill that please?
B	oh wow
C	oh
A	and she'd do that and that'd be and then she'd put it in the freezer and then we'd have it after whatever
C	after dinner yeah
A	yeah after dinner or after tea
B	yeah that's a really good idea
A	whenever it was right we'll have then we'd have whatever for tea and then we'd all have this ice cream with fruit
C	mm
A	and chocolate stuff and
B	yeah
C	my mum used
A	so we used to go and get this and she it used to go on for forever and ever cos obviously like normally you do the just a
C	a nice big bowl yeah
B	yeah
A	just a cone don't you but this is like
C	yeah
A	and
B	ah
C	my parents it seemed always used to buy everything wholesale for all of my teenage life we had one box of er wafer cornets
B	oh
C	and it was the box was I don't know almost as big as a cooker
C	and it was like it used to live on top of the freezer and we had used to have to climb up to get this massive box down
A	mm
C	to get a stale
A	yeah cos cos they don't last forever do they? they go dry
C	they don't
A	it's like Rice Krispies when the box is open you
C	yeah
A	and
C	and the boxes the cartons of ice cream
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	were I don't know what were they five litres or something?
B	I remember those yeah
C	of of ice cream?
A	mm
C	and you'd use them to store all our Lego in and our
A	yeah
C	our Sindys cos we didn't have Barbies in those days we all had Sindys
A	no I had Sindys yeah I had a Sindy a Sindy I didn't have Sindys
C	yes yeah oh yeah yeah I I tended to get hand-me-down Sindys
A	yeah
C	is your sister older than you or younger?
B	no she's younger
C	is she younger?
B	yeah
C	and have you got sisters?
A	I've got a younger sister and a brother I've got three elder step sisters and a younger step brother and I've got two
B	oh
A	I've got a younger half-sister and a younger half-brother
B	wow
A	wow yeah
B	that's a lot
A	it is
C	that's a crowd isn't it?
A	that's what you call a a modern family isn't it?
C	yeah yeah
A	I've never met the half-brother and sister but that you know because they were my like my dad's second family
C	yeah
A	erm so though I see him now and I'm mentioned maybe like catching up with them would be nice and he's not
C	yes
A	he's like avoided it so but for me I'd like to
C	mm
A	but I know they didn't know about us until
C	really?
A	he never never told them about us no no he sort of but I questioned him on it and he said well he wanted to wait until they were old enough he thought to understand
B	yeah
A	I thought but you know this lad's growing up thinking he's the eldest him and his little sister and all of a sudden he finds out he's got
C	and there's another two
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and then he finds out he's actually got two older sisters and an older brother as well and I just
C	yeah
A	and I just yeah but
C	so that's a shame
B	so how did how
A	people have their own ideas of how to do things don't they?
C	of course
B	so how did that happen? if you don't mind me asking
A	mm
B	so did he was he with so
A	oh no no after mm he him and mum divorced
B	right
A	and then he married again
B	yeah
A	and had two more children
B	oh okay
C	and was that
A	erm
B	yeah how
A	we were in
C	to come this this way
A	erm yeah mum's at
C	oh right
A	so she was
C	oh
A	backwards and forwards yeah and then when
C	mm
A	they split up and we moved into
C	yeah
A	erm so that she could be nearer for
C	yeah
A	you know for travelling for the teacher training
C	mm
A	so and then after that he obviously met erm
C	but it it wasn't a case of you were likely to bump into him on the street with his new family
B	yeah that's what I mean yeah
A	no no no no cos we were
C	cos they would say who's this then?
A	no well I wasn't seeing him then anyway it was
C	oh
B	oh
A	you know it was all very estranged and I wanted to see him but
C	mm
A	and you think
B	oh good good
C	sometimes it's not too late is it
A	no no
B	mm
C	although you can
A	no
C	you can wish for the years that have passed
B	mm
C	in-between
A	well he says now so many times you know looking back if he'd done things differently and the regret he's got of not having had me in his life and
C	mm
A	cos I was always like his little girl and
B	yeah
A	he used to he used to come in from work and come running over and pick me up and sit with me and chat before he even went to mum you know
A	and it and I but I was I was his little blue-eyed girl and
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know he was my daddy so
C	yeah yeah do you know with hindsight we'd we'd all be a lot wiser wouldn't we?
A	oh yeah exactly
B	oh of course yeah
A	yeah
C	and I think you just have to accept that you know things
A	oh yeah
C	and fair enough the bad things happened
A	yeah
C	but were they
A	mm oh yeah I can see it
C	and things happen for a reason
B	everything happens for a reason yeah well and truly
A	you wouldn't be the person that you you are now if it wasn't for how you were in all the experiences
C	all the battles that you've had all the positives and
A	oh yeah definitely yeah
B	oh yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	oh god yeah
A	very much so
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh excuse me hiccups
B	sorry to hark back to something that we were talking about earlier but I meant to say erm and then I forgot cos I think I was doing something else but you know how we were talking about how language has changed now?
C	oh yes
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	erm he's recently got a new girlfriend who's from Lithuania
A	mm
C	okay
B	and she's quite young erm well I say she's quite young think she's twenty-one twenty-two so she's
A	mm
C	huh child
B	she's a child compared to us
B	but her English is good
A	mm
B	like I knew we knew her before cos she's at work as well but I always thought she had quite good English compared to other people but she does struggle to follow our conversation
A	mm
B	because I think we all talk so fast and we use
C	mm
B	so many references to just
A	yeah
B	things that are a bit out of her scope but you don't realise that
C	yeah
B	until you have that person within your midst
A	yes
B	who hasn't
A	mm
B	just had the same upbringing as you how remote it can be
C	yeah
A	mm
C	or if you're learning another language
B	mm
C	so I don't know if either of you did any school exchanges er in if you were doing languages at school?
B	no I didn't do it then
A	no
B	no
C	I went to Germany twice so you you
B	mm
C	they come and stay with you and your family
B	yeah
C	and you go and stay with them in
A	mm
C	in their family and it makes you realise that actually what you're taught in school you're er you're
B	mm
A	yeah yeah
C	but when you get with a family
B	mm
C	compared to
A	mm
C	thirty forty fifty years ago
B	mm
A	yeah
C	they were a lot more formal a lot more
B	yeah
C	you know structured whereas now it's all sort of chat and conversations
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and and dialects as well
B	yeah
C	and I've I almost it was like learning German all over again when I was on these exchanges
A	yeah mm
C	and you would come back and you'd start using some of the conversation in class and the teacher would say no that's not right
A	mm
C	and
A	yeah
C	so they were brought up with the language but still the way they were teaching it was very very formal
B	mm
A	mm
C	and they wouldn't accept when you say to them well when I stayed with a family
A	well that's what they say mm
C	this is how they talk
B	yeah
C	yeah and they didn't say this very formal structured sentence they'd just abbreviate it
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and
B	yeah
C	you have to know the
A	yeah
C	yeah but you know for to put it into practice to actually make use of it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	to be able to use it as a language later on
C	yeah
A	you need to be able to talk the way they talk
C	exactly
A	rather than
B	exactly
A	er it's like English now
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
C	mm well you only need to listen to a group of fourteen-year-olds
A	mm
C	and
B	oh it annoys me sometimes when I hear people speak
C	a completely different language aren't they?
A	mm
B	oh just when I hear like tenses like used really incorrectly and stuff it just
A	mm
C	do you know what my my pet hate is word wise? anything that I've been involved in that's er that's remotely sort of HRish
A	mm
B	mm
C	the number of people that say and somebody did it this week actually the number of people that say I don't feel like I've been
A	oh
C	instead of treated properly
A	mm
B	oh yeah
C	er you know I'm tret differently to them
B	that's quite a local kind of
A	yeah
B	accent isn't it?
C	I thought that
A	it is yeah yeah definitely
B	is it? isn't it?
C	I did think that
A	yeah
C	because I'd heard it a lot on
B	mm
C	when I worked for one company in
A	mm
C	and beforehand we'd say
C	or excuses that they would make erm we could almost always guess which people would say
A	mm
C	and it didn't even have a T on the end
B	mm
A	yeah
C	I'm not tre the same as everyone else
A	yeah
C	and er we could almost always get it right
A	mm
C	and then I was sat at home one night watching the news and it was about the Great North Run
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	and is is it Steve Cram who's from
A	yes
C	Newcastle he came on and he used the word as well
A	mm
C	so after that the HR assistant
B	yeah
C	and we're putting pins on every time
A	got pins yeah
C	and I still bump into him now cos it's still in HR and I still bump into him and this is it's nine years since I left there so yeah nine ten years and we still say about our map
A	mm
C	and we'll and we'll just you know we don't even need to broach a conversation but he'll say I put a pin in Swansea the other day
B	yeah
C	or or er you know Exeter or wherever it was
A	mm
B	oh
C	cos we yeah did think it was local
B	infuriates me
C	yeah I I'm
A	yeah well when I was growing up there was a a lady who used to always say oh so I
C	yeah
A	I tret mesen to this today I
C	tret mesen to a new dress or whatever
A	I went to the shopping I was meant to be doing this and this but I tret mesen to so and so
C	mm
A	tret mesen cos mesen's
C	the vowel
B	yeah
A	yeah exactly
C	yeah
A	yeah oh so would you do people say yoursen? no they don't say that it's just mesen well why is it not yoursen?
C	yeah it doesn't make sense
B	see always used to laugh a little about you know like erm that kind of fen kind of like
A	mm
B	cos obviously she's from
A	mm
C	yeah
B	like she'll say B and coo she won't say B and Q
A	mm
C	yeah compooter
A	compooter mm
A	compooter mm
C	yeah
B	yeah there's quite a few of them that she'll say like that and she used to get such a ribbing wherever we used to like when we used to all work together
C	well I said to one of the
B	yeah
A	mm
C	if you finish at half five go down to your car you can sit in your parking space in the car for five or ten minutes while traffic passes you
A	mm
C	and then you can sit in the queue to get out of the business park for another five or ten minutes so I never make any attempt to head to my car
A	mm
C	till about twenty to and one of our managers has a corner office and I just sort of poked my head in there so I could see out of his window and he said what you doing? I said I'm looking to see if there's a coo
B	oh
A	a coo
C	he said coo what's a coo? I said a queue he said well why did you say
A	mm
C	surely I don't have to explain that to you and he'd never
A	mm
C	noticed it
A	mm
B	are you down erm
C	yeah
B	I used to work see me
C	oh yes yeah
B	yeah
C	directly opposite I
B	directly yeah
C	from where if I go like that and look
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I look straight over
A	cos
C	oh have they?
A	mm well earlier this year
B	oh have they?
A	that's my accountant
B	oh
C	oh
A	so when I went to see him you had to find it the first time to try I'm dropping stuff and off we didn't
A	yeah in there somewhere
C	yeah mm
A	what's the name of your company?
A	mm I'll look out for it next time I'm coming and cos er his you go in you go in there and it's the very first turning off and it's in that first block
C	what on the left-hand side on produce?
A	erm on the right as you go in
C	oh so where
A	oh I I don't know I didn't really look
C	yeah that's it's
A	but yeah it's the
C	yeah
A	little quadrant bit there and
C	but there are four turnings
A	yeah
C	first left and right and then the second left right
A	yeah
C	we're on the the second on
A	oh
C	the right one the
A	I wouldn't see you then
C	you can't go any further
A	I wouldn't see you then
C	no that's where we are and because we're all business-to-business
A	mm
C	we don't really get
A	no
C	so although we've got signage it's not
A	yeah
C	it's not very obvious
A	yeah you're not yeah
C	but as long as the postman knows where were are we're alright
A	mm dunno you
B	oh yeah yeah
A	how many shops are there now?
B	there's over fifty but not all of them are owned by a lot of them are franchises
A	oh right
B	and I think we have or we have
A	mm
B	the rest are all franchises
A	cos you said the other day
B	yeah
A	something about the production line and I didn't
B	oh yeah we product the e-liquid
A	right oh okay
B	yeah we product the e-liquid and the hardware comes from China
A	oh right
C	mm
A	so then
B	yeah
A	you actually make them and
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah it's all to pharmaceutical grade level but I don't really like talking about
A	yeah
B	got a clean room yeah
B	and the girls have to wear you know
A	yeah
C	hairnets and things
B	yeah hairnets yeah
A	mm mm no that's
B	yeah
A	cos I I knew obviously that it was the company
B	yeah
A	and that you had different shops that were open in different places but I didn't realise I thought you brought the product in from somewhere
B	mm
A	I didn't realise it was actually made on the premises
B	yeah no it's made yeah
C	mm
B	we make the
C	yes I always imagine a big box
A	mm
C	that's been delivered
A	mm
C	on the back of a forklift truck
A	yeah
C	and you just unpack them and then send them out to the
B	it used to be
A	so so when they started the business cos
B	yeah
A	I know you said it's erm
B	yeah
A	so what did they start the business as? making them or just buying them?
B	erm well they used to have another company doing they've had a few businesses between them but at the time they were doing online marketing and then this other guy
A	mm
B	to give up smoking
C	oh
B	so then
A	mm
B	erm for
C	wow
B	the all the stock had gone
A	wow
B	and I think then he put a thousand pound of stock and again it went in twenty-four hours
A	mm
B	and then they were like oh my god and then
A	this is yeah
B	they started to
C	yeah
B	obviously go down that line that was about three years ago now
A	mm mm
B	yeah they're doing really well bless em
A	yeah they have done really well
B	yeah
C	mm they work hard though don't they?
B	yeah there's about fifty employees now so yeah it's like really big growth yeah
A	mm
B	bless him
C	mm
A	yeah and
C	it's amazing what you can do when you it's just getting the right product at the right time isn't it?
B	it is and it's all because of
A	mm
B	but then in a few months later they'd bought his business so he's one of our directors now so it all worked out karma wise so
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	even though I'm sure that his family still are a bit like oh cos he's only got ten percent and stuff but you know
A	but he didn't do it
C	oh has he?
A	he he could quite easily have bought some stock done a basic website and started from there couldn't he? so
B	exactly exactly
C	mm
A	so
B	exactly yeah
A	and it's the people that have got the get up and go to do it
B	exactly yeah
A	so what other businesses did they have before?
B	erm well
A	mm
B	so that was year ago now
A	mm
B	erm they did that and then online marketing which
A	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah oh yeah yeah
B	that little bit of uncertainty
A	and if the e-cigs go out of fashion as well
B	yeah
A	it's to but I think they've obviously got the right business idea and they work well together
B	oh yeah yeah they've all got their strengths
A	so if it were to start going and they realise
B	yeah
A	they'd look and go okay and they've got a big enough company
B	mm
A	to be able to sort of go into something else
B	oh yeah yeah
C	mm
A	on the back of that now
B	oh definitely definitely like I told you they'd
A	mm
B	yeah so
A	yeah
B	let's see
A	mm
A	mm
B	but I'm quite yeah it'll be alright
C	but as long as you've got some kind of a backup plan
B	yeah
C	it's looking out for
B	yeah
C	another product or another service
B	yeah exactly
C	if if this one does start to decline and let's face it it's
B	yeah oh yeah I think it has helped a lot of people
C	and I know I know loads of people
B	yeah
C	that have used used them and
B	yeah
C	used them really really well
B	yeah
C	and it's not gonna stop overnight
A	no
B	no no
A	no
B	yeah there's always uncertainty with the regulation all the tobacco companies have loads of clout and stuff so
C	of course they do
A	mm
B	so and they obviously
A	yeah
B	the dream is to get bought out by a big company
C	mm
A	yeah exactly
B	that is our dream
C	and then retire
B	yeah our
C	retire at thirty
B	our our accountants actually did say like oh when you get bought out and I was like
A	mm
B	they said when and I'm like
A	yeah
B	it it'll never happen but that's the dream
A	no mm could do
C	well you don't know though do you? you don't know what's around the corner
B	yeah
A	cos there'll be people looking round for companies and your company now is big enough that it'll be popping up on some people's radars
B	mm and they are only we do this in the UK now yeah

B	or millions or thousands
B	in fact anything
A	a tenner
B	anything at all yeah a tenner
C	what do you think what do you think
B	well
C	if if money wasn't an object
B	his background was IT so he was always network security
A	mm
B	so he used to work for like the police and the MOD and stuff like doing like securing the network basically but I don't think he'd go back to that I think he would
A	mm
B	have enough
C	mm
B	I don't think he could
C	to work for somebody else
A	yeah
B	yeah I think he I'd probably go back to work and I think he'd probably do the house husband thing
A	mm
B	I don't think he'd last very long
B	I honestly don't
A	no
C	of course it is
B	so they think
A	mm
B	but yeah
A	mm
B	fingers crossed you know I'm sure it will be and he's got
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and stuff so
C	it's important though isn't it?
B	yeah
C	and what did you do if if the
B	yeah
C	if the money wasn't an object if you were if you were if you could pick a a
B	oh I've always had ideas go on
A	mm what I'd really like to do I'd like to be an emergency foster carer
B	ah
A	sort of thing
B	that's very worthwhile
C	oh
A	mm
B	I my friend's mum does that
A	yeah I'd it would be the short-term things
C	I interviewed a lady yesterday
A	that just
B	yeah
A	there's an issue or problem have this child baby now
B	yeah
A	four days whatever until it gets in to wherever it's going and just
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	really hard
C	she erm gives up her weekends
A	mm
C	every other weekend although it can swap around a little bit so if there is a child in foster care
A	mm
C	and normally for the ones that she
A	mm
C	and they might be erm they might be troubled there might be behavioural issues
A	mm
C	so they're with foster parents
A	mm
C	maybe short term maybe long term but that foster parent needs a break
A	yeah bit of respite
B	oh right yeah
C	so every other weekend
A	mm
C	this lady will have the child or the children just just overnight really
A	mm
A	mm
C	to give the the foster parents a break so she's like a foster foster parent
B	yeah
A	mm
C	erm and I
B	wow

C	and your your life and everything don't you to do that?
B	it's an amazing thing to do
A	yeah yeah I'd love to do that
B	absolutely
A	but it won't happen because of the lifestyle we lead and you know I haven't
C	it's like getting a dog isn't it?
