A	so what do you want to do this afternoon when we get over to your house?
B	well we can have a look in one of those another one of those top cupboards
A	mm
B	to see what erm
A	mm I favour that top cupboard on the right because I think there might be toys in there
B	mm with the little pieces of er brown er well rectangles of brown plastic with holes in but but er
A	it was quite like chocolate really wasn't it?
B	yes well it was a bit undulating
A	mm
B	and which you use a little erm plastic
A	mm
B	with a point on
A	yes
B	because all the flowers had a little erm sort of dimple in them at the bottom so that you could push them in with this implement and make them stand up like tulips and
A	yes yes
B	daffodils and and all sorts of plants
A	well I think the tulips and the daffodils actually had that little hole
B	mm cabbages you did because they were little heart things
A	oh yes I remember the cabbages
B	like tiny Brussels sprouts
A	yes
B	well a Brussels sprout grows up a stem it would have leaves at the bottom and it might have a bit of that on the top but I don't know that we I don't think we had the runner bean because I didn't remember the frames
A	mm
B	I don't know I can't remember that
A	but the vegetables all came in my time with the garden pond
B	they were later yes
A	whereas you had the erm you had the flower borders and the flowers
B	I think I had the crazy paving
A	yes
B	greenhouse did I have the greenhouse?
A	I think so I I do
B	because the greenhouse had little tiny seed trays with I think they had little lines of green things in them or you could put or you could put little lines of green in there but there were some
A	oh yes
B	yes
A	obviously in green I wonder what happened to my false eyelashes
A	yes I was going to say it was before that time when I was in that false eyelash era
B	and you got little tiny individual flower pots you could push the plants in as well
A	mm
B	I think they might have done because they were a bit toppley-over otherwise I do believe we I think
A	gosh
B	yes
A	mm
B	quite possibly
A	or somewhere linked in that era
B	I didn't start off with a pond because I had the garden set to go with my Bayko set which would be considered as a a very dangerous thing for small children to play with now because it had rods metal rods you put in holes and slid the bricks down so there's all those spikey things you can stick yourself on
A	no
B	it was green the erm base was a greeny
A	the
B	you put the poles in
A	you put the poles in and then you put the first floor in
B	yes you had the poles
A	then you put some brown stuff in to support your corners
B	oh yes you you had erm I don't know what it was made of it was it wasn't exactly plastic it was sort of a cross between plastic and a a kind of like erm oil cloth in it it was sort of
A	they probably hadn't invented plastic as we know it we are pre Lego here
B	no
A	mm
B	no it was er like you have over a bay window that you've got the roof coming down and then you've got the the angled piece that sticks out over the bay I've forgotten what they are called now
A	mm
B	one of those anyway you put those fancy bits on the roof to build out a a bay window
A	mm
B	well the big roofs were solid
A	so you had to buy
B	yes but you could only build houses that were on the right grid on a grid pattern you couldn't make a an odd half inch somewhere so it had to be in the proportions of that but you could make up your own there's a whole book of erm designs of houses and castles and things you could garages and all sorts of things you could build but you could do freehand as well as long as you considered what components you'd got because I did have several roofs and there were also flat bits that you could make that you could possibly use as a garage or flat or you could put two of them together to make a small er pitched roof I mean pitched you know with a yes and there were different bays and things but I don't know how old that was because it was used before me I think
A	yes
B	you know so thinking that it was really from another era because I used to play with it when I was quite small you used to play with it when you were quite small didn't you? because I used to make houses for the likes of
A	mm
B	and you had Lego yes
A	but Lego wasn't as wasn't as adaptable when it first came out because you only had the big size bricks but there's hundreds of ways that they erm but the what are we calling it? the building set
B	mm
A	Bayko would be dangerous
B	well there was all the small pieces because you could get they were they were quite thin or maybe half inch half inch square but only about quarter of an inch thin they were the ones that slotted in in red and white and then you could get ones that were just half the size of that or even thinner just for doing different bits stripes in brickwork or bits to fill in bays and they were very tiny
A	mm
B	and you got different size poles because you are going to need shorter poles for some things
A	yes there was quite a lot to it wasn't there?
B	mm that's right because dad made that nice erm box
A	I wonder where he got it from?
B	I don't know
A	perhaps somebody at school had it
B	it's possible it could have come from the
A	was he older than you?
B	yes
A	oh that would possibly be it then
B	and he was a boy I don't know so it may have come that way I don't think it was
A	yes
B	or somewhere somebody in that neck of the woods erm
A	yes
B	mm that's right
A	but the
B	and he was an only boy and he hadn't got a brother
A	yes
B	mm
A	and did father
B	well he got all the things out and saw how many there were and then constructed the box so it would fit in because you had to put it back in the right compartments
A	mm
B	yes
A	oh
B	it says transistors up the side but it is er I think he was putting stuff gradually things into them
A	yes well if you have any that will get thrown away it's worth offering them and it's worth thinking around if you could use them for other things like cottons or needles or something
B	mm yes well this is it I mean I've got I've got loads of erm nuts and bolts and screws and nails and things that I need to sort of my own because some of my stuff is here and some of my stuff is at
A	mm
B	yes I don't want to throw any tools away well not throw them away I don't want to give them away necessarily
A	no
B	because
A	mm
B	I was always using his tool kit so I don't think he would mind
A	anyway I guess we probably ought to be getting ready for going out now what do you think?
B	I think so yes if we don't get blown away getting into the car
A	gosh it is really rough out there today isn't it?
B	mm I'm not going to go along the road with the big trees
A	no
B	that occasionally fall down and bits come off
A	enough trouble with your own trees but we can go round the back can't we?
B	yes
A	well okay let me just er tidy this off then
