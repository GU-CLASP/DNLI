A	okay well let's get it started
B	okay
A	eh we'll talk about work in a minute aren't we?
B	yeah
A	and I was just wondering you got you've got a Yorkshire accent?
B	I have
A	I was just wondered and you're from
B	I am
A	I was just wondering
B	it's in South
A	Cos
B	Yorkshire
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	gotcha
B	but I think em that where I used to live em was quite a broad accent but em neighbouring areas such as
A	mm
B	I think if you compare their accents with
A	they'd be different? Yeah
B	Cos they're very very much more broad
A	yeah
B	and I think a bit more difficult to understand
A	yeah
B	he did?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's a massive place it's just got em
B	mm
A	it's it's all over the east of the Pennines
B	mm
A	almost going up towards
B	yeah
A	but the accent changes again to a different kind of one
B	it does  It does  yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	thirty-eight years and I
A	yeah
B	I think sometimes that I sound quite Yorkshire and there's certain things that I know I definitely say that are very Yorkshire-isms but
A	yeah
B	you might you know that better than me
A	yeah
B	you might do you pick that up?
A	yeah a little bit yeah
B	is it now?
A	so it's as if it's become more mild
B	yeah
A	and it's moving towards  moving towards  a neutral kind of accent
B	mm
A	but it's not not there
B	yeah
A	you know kind of thing
B	yeah
A	but it's like quite flat
B	mm
A	you know
B	I don't think I sound as though I don't know
A	yeah
B	and born and bred in
A	yeah
B	Will you know say em say some things and it's just that
A	yeah
B	but I don't know maybe I do
A	yeah
B	but I
A	yeah
B	that's it isn't it?
A	yeah I've heard some of the some strange words they would be like  for crying
B	oh yes  for crying
A	which I know is a Norse word
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah I'll tell you one of the funny things that used to really make me laugh
A	yeah
B	you know you could go to a shop
A	mm
B	and they were called an outdoorsy to buy alcohol outdoors
A	oh yeah
B	but in
A	oh
B	they are called them beer-offs
A	veers offs? So is that a
B	so so Yorkshire
B	so you always used to say em things like I'm going to the beer off to get em I don't know a bottle of beer or a bottle of pop or something like that
A	yes
B	em and eh my husband
A	mm
B	em are you right? And I would say what does he mean by that are you right?
A	it means are you health are you healthy?
B	and it means are you ready? Are you ready
A	oh does it? Of course you are
B	and he will still say it to me now if we if he's
A	yeah
B	waiting for me to go out somewhere
A	yeah
B	em he'll often say to me are you right? And I know what it means now obviously cos we've been married twenty-five year
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but years ago I couldn't ever make out ever understand
A	mm
B	what are you right means but there you go
A	yeah
B	what about? Cos you you're are you from
A	yes
B	yeah
A	in Sussex
B	yeah
A	until I was five years old
B	yeah
A	and then now my parents I mean my dad's parents were northerners my mum's parents were southerners
B	mm
A	and eh we moved up to Midlands cos he worked in a brewery
B	yeah
A	so eh eh but my dad was quite posh
B	yeah
A	and he wanted me to speak properly
B	yeah
A	so what happened was I spent most of my childhood trying to speak posh without realising I was doing it
B	mm
A	and then at about the age of eleven or twelve I suddenly got my Burton accent and then the funny thing was when I was fourteen I moved away from Burton
B	mm
A	so I had this upper Midlands accent probably
B	mm
A	for about three years
B	yeah
A	you know they they they say things up there like likkle instead of little
B	yeah
A	you know em
B	you dividend? Oh ah
A	you know you dividend
B	oh ah that's funny
A	and then to say hello they say hey up
B	yeah
A	not
B	yeah
A	which I never got down south cos when I was fourteen we moved down to Essex
B	yeah
A	the accent down there is very different
B	mm
A	Essex was very agricultural after the Second World War em maybe starting just before it there was lots of overspill from London
B	mm
A	so Essex is really kind of well when I was there in the nineteen eighties it's like one generation away from being Cockney's
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	which is more like Kent
B	yeah
A	and it's like it's a bit like ooh ar ooh ar kind of thing
B	mm
A	but you just don't get it you know in the urban areas
B	mm
A	so I was there for a few years and then em
B	mm
A	and then a few years later I met this girl who was in from
B	mm
A	and I've been in
B	mm hmm right right
A	yeah
B	no
A	seventeen years? Goodness me how time flies when you're having fun
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's funny because I cos I've lived here all this time
A	mm
B	but and I kinda lost touch with a lot of my family other than my mum and my sister in
A	A pit village?
B	em and it was called  it was called
A	what is that you know? Like like you mean like in a colliery near it?
B	yeah it's a pit village
A	alright
B	yeah and it's called
A	alright
B	no no no it's a pit
A	oh it was a pit that village
B	and it's was
A	okay
B	em it's called Aston em
A	Aston yeah yeah
B	and it's just outside em
A	yeah
B	so em that's where and em they they've they're a big big family but none of them have ever moved out of Aston
A	mm
B	so their accent is really really quite thick
A	mm
B	I don't I know I have lots and lots of cousins but I've never ever see
A	I bet they support the local football team
B	I don't know if they've got one
A	wear the kit at weekends that kind of thing
B	I don't know actually what they do but when I
A	mm
B	but em when mum my mum was ill recently as well last year
A	yeah I remember yeah
B	and I had to phone one of my cousins em who my mum keeps in touch with
A	yeah
B	to tell her
A	yeah
B	cos as soon as I heard her on the phone I was quite nostalgic for
A	oh yeah
B	for Sheffield
A	yeah
B	had that kind of you know hello me love and I say that quite a lot me love
A	yeah
B	to people and I know I do it but it was just the way that she said it
A	yeah
B	and eh
A	that's a kind of a Burtonian thing as well cos I mean
B	yeah
A	I I probably as a child I felt nostalgic for Burton-on-Trent
B	yeah
A	and the person that I imagine feeling nostalgic for
B	yeah
A	would be my best friend's mum
B	yeah
A	Cos she said oh me likkle cabbage would you like some treacle
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and she'd feed me up until I was bursting with cakes you know
B	yeah
A	I don't feel so nostalgic you know
B	mm
A	and eh a lot of the accents and everything
B	mm
A	and em in my family often offers they're very nice
B	mm
A	Cos they're my family
B	mm
A	I remember being a kid in Staffordshire and I remember things like the breweries and eh you know the Marmite factory and the Roadworks factory and you know the railway lines I used to play on when I was a kid
B	yeah
A	avoiding the trains obviously cos I'm still here
B	yeah
A	you know but yeah hmm
B	it's funny cos my grandson
A	yeah
B	and he's now getting a real
A	olden yeah
B	yeah and he's so
A	is
B	oh yeah
A	very different?
B	really yeah it's very very different
A	is it more like a Yorkshire accent or is that just me being a bit na√Øve?
B	no I don't think it's like a Yorkshire accent but it's just got it's own unique em
A	yeah
B	I don't know but there's something about it
A	yeah
B	I suppose cos I don't
A	it's in its own kind of place kind of thing
B	it's just its own place but its
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but it's funny now
A	I love
B	just as he's so cos he's so young and you can just hear that
A	mm
B	he's now getting his own individuality and you know and all of a sudden he comes out with something that you think oh that is really
A	mm
B	em you know chatting away in that type of accent really
A	yeah yeah
B	but em yeah
A	I think that's my cousins are shocked when they they hear me cos they're unusual I was put up in Staffordshire
B	mm
B	yeah
A	so they might they probably think I'm a northerner and on some level
B	yeah
A	which is as you know is a
B	yeah
A	but that's how they'll be
B	yeah
A	they'll be they you know oh you don't say grass like that
B	yeah
A	you're saying grass you know that kind of thing
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	em
B	the other thing will be of course is my other grandson will be a southerner
A	well
B	so he's gonna have em a
A	yeah I was tempted to say never mind there
B	I know
A	it's just this this but it's a birth thing and you can't do anything about it
B	I know
A	and some of them are quite nice
B	yeah
A	I remember when I was in Essex some of them were quite nice
B	yeah but we'll they'll we'll have to see what how what sort of accent he
A	yeah
B	he has
A	I
B	this is true
A	you know
B	yeah
A	you know
B	that's just what my daughter is going through at the moment I know
A	oh the one with with all the children on on on the sofa?
B	all the babies  All the babies Yeah
A	eh
B	yeah and they were visiting em her friends that who who she met through The National Childbirth Trust
A	mm
B	and they've all had babies within a month of each other
A	oh yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	cos they have a flat at the moment
A	oh no
B	but the trouble is is the area
A	mm
B	wasn't that nice and the schools are not that good
A	that's awful that's what this country is like
B	whether you have a good
A	it's true that's why this country just wants what you can choose for
B	yeah
A	that's it really I mean
B	mm
A	I always though it I had kids in an area that was run down a bit
B	yeah
A	being an imagined professor to my children and
A	and I would  I would  teach them about my world view
B	no you  No you  wouldn't
A	and how to steal things
B	we are digressing now
A	and I think we're talking a
B	you can go off into a different
A	yeah you know
B	yeah I think we've probably exhausted the dialect and accent bit now haven't we?
A	yeah well we we've covered the fact that you're a northerner and I'm I'm a southerner in terms of accent
B	that's true
A	which is quite nice
B	did you have you ever watched the film The Full Monty? That was  That was
A	yes
B	em actually filmed in
B	that's the one
A	yeah
B	well that that's obviously that was em that was  that was  filmed in em in
A	mm
B	loads of areas where I used to go
A	mm
B	when I was a lot younger
A	actually I this is quite true I was amazed Sean Bean wasn't in it
B	yeah
A	it had that really good Scottish actor
B	yeah
A	em
B	what's his name now?
A	he's quite small and quite intense
B	yeah
A	he's got like an English eh foreign name because it's Carlisle
B	Robert Carlisle
A	yeah
B	that's it Robert Carlisle
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	maybe with the lights out
B	yeah
A	you know
B	it was a
A	you need a bravery award for that film
B	at the beginning
A	yeah
B	of the film at the start of the film I think I've told you that it it takes you through
A	that would be really really the bit of the film I find
B	em companies and everything
A	really interesting
B	and it was there used to be a big what's called a big hole in the ground and that's what it was called in
A	yeah
B	for everybody in the seventies
A	yeah
B	we always everybody all the young people used to meet
A	yeah
B	at the hole in the ground
B	and
A	Good one
B	eh it used to be like a big fish tank as well around it as well but the at the beginning of The Full Monty it actually takes you em to there as well
A	mm
B	so it's like it was like going back in time really
A	yeah
B	like em it's like
A	and the film is based off the old steel workers who got laid off cos of the industry
B	that got made redundant
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	yeah
B	there's quite a bit of sadness in that film as well cos the guy
A	yeah
B	I don't know if you remember seeing it the guy who's in the band
A	yeah
B	em and he tries to kill himself
A	oh
B	with the exhaust fumes
A	yeah
B	em so there's quite a lot
A	yeah
B	there is a bit of sadness in that and
A	yeah
B	em then he was rescued
A	I know yeah yeah
B	yeah we won't talk about that
A	yeah
B	we won't talk about that
A	it's not like he's mind or anything cos he's gone but you know
B	oh yeah Brassed Off that's the
A	and it's was about you know not the steel works the colliery pit closes
B	yeah
A	but the whole village is based around the colliery
B	yeah
A	and once the coal mining goes the village goes it's just wiped out you know
B	yeah
A	and em
B	what's the guy that's died who was the star in that he was em a really good actor eh
A	Pete Postlethwaite
B	Pete Postlethwaite
A	with the big big pink cheek bones up to here
B	yeah
A	he was like an alien wasn't he?
B	Pete Postlethwaite
A	he was good he was
B	A good actor
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	A very craggy
B	yeah
A	because it was
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah it was
B	yeah
A	A kind of lived in face
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I tend to like British character actors they're my favourite anyway
B	yeah
A	mm
B	Joan Collin's daughter was in that as well I think
A	oh she was the blond eh
B	oh
A	but they closed it so that they were even more brassed off
B	oh dear
A	american's use that as well cos they use the word pissed without the word off but if you're pissed in England you're drunk whereas in America you're just angry
B	mm
A	Cos like in America rubber is a condom
B	oh dear
A	this is what I'm like
B	okay
A	okay
B	okay
A	I was wondering
B	yeah you can have a look my ankle
A	and describe verbally?
B	yeah
A	because
B	it's swollen swollen
A	goodness me
B	no ankle
A	you don't have an ankle
B	I've lost my ankle
A	I'm exaggerating
B	yeah
A	but it just looks swollen generally
B	yeah it is
A	doesn't it?
B	it is very painful
A	and how did you do it? You you were jumping up down the stairs or something?
B	yeah
A	oh no
B	and decided to do it in bare feet
A	bare feet?
B	yes
A	you never told me this
B	no
A	A little bit of carpet
B	but I I just
A	mm
B	I didn't realise after I had just decided in a fit of you know ooh I'll just do a hundred steps up and down get my for my fitness thing
A	yeah
B	and then I was fine afterwards but it wasn't until
A	that's the thing
B	two two days
A	you weren't injured at the time
B	it was yeah
A	yeah
B	just up down up you know just up and down two steps a hundred times
A	mm
B	em and it and I I felt alright afterwards and I got a bit out of breath and everything
A	mm
B	I did not
A	doesn't look very good
B	yeah
A	I had a funny thing on my feet
B	yeah
A	which similarly started out as painless
B	mm
A	but stayed painless and what I had I might still have I had a big blue circle where my ankle was
B	mm
A	and I thought how did I do that? Well it's a blue circle
B	mm
A	blood there and what happened to my ankle was at some point a tiny little vein ruptured
B	mm
A	and it never
B	right
A	and the blood kept going
B	yeah
A	and then slowly came back but it was completely painless but it just looked very very weird you know
B	mm
A	if it had been too much bigger I would have had a blue foot and I could have taken it out at parties and and scared people with my blue foot
B	yeah
A	but I didn't of course cos I'm sensible
B	well I think every day when I get up it's gonna go down or something
A	oh yeah
B	but em
A	can you put witch hazel on it or something? You know witch hazel?
B	I put no
A	out the witch hazel would come out and the bump would go down
B	I put ice on it  I put ice on it
A	mm
B	but the only thing I had in my freezer was a pack of Aunty Bessie's roast potatoes
A	that's nice
B	yeah I just kept it on for half an hour
A	it's another use of potatoes isn't it?
B	yeah
A	you know
B	but that was it really so yeah
A	no that's good
B	yeah
A	you can articulate it a bit which is good
B	mm
A	I think you've got to look at the positives haven't you? You know
B	so I don't know
A	it's not like you
B	no not
A	it's just
B	and that's why I keep thinking I've been walking around on something that's you know
A	mm
B	fractured or something like that and I should have had it
A	yeah
B	wrapped up
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	hooray
