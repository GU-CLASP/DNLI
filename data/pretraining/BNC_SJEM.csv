C	two pound you mean?
B	two pound sorry yeah
C	no not really
B	I'm sure they were earning enough but there's so many different types of lottery now is there really any need to do that? that just seems a bit greedy doesn't it?

B	yeah
C	I don't now I just do two lines
B	thankfully only two of your lines were set lines weren't they?
