A	right so what did you say?
B	well I sent I sent a text
A	yeah
B	sending all our love
A	mhm
B	no but she didn't get back yesterday either
A	no
A	weird pictures and stuff
B	yeah
A	and it had a picture of these two kids hugging each other
B	yeah
A	and it said if you ask me how I am and I say I'm fine
B	I'm not
A	it really means I need a hug
B	oh
A	and then loads of people
B	but that's all I want to do is go round there and
A	yeah
B	give her a big hug
A	yeah
B	mm it's a bit quick to come to terms with it
A	yeah
B	it's cos it's one of those things
A	mm
B	well some people do feel feel it and that's why they go and get tested
A	yeah
B	it just pops up
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	huh
B	it's like
A	yeah
B	and then they they told her she had some er
A	yeah
B	and that she's only got ten years
A	what?
B	yeah
A	how can people predict you've got ten years?
B	I don't know
A	that's a bit
B	I don't
A	I don't agree with that
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	once they're diagnosed then
A	right
B	generally they last about ten years
A	yeah but like when my brother was born they said um he's got one day
B	yeah they don't know for sure do they
A	what thirty-three years old
B	no
B	are they gonna tell
A	no
B	Cos
A	no
B	I hope they don't
A	no they can't tell him
B	Cos they do like to tell everybody what's happening
A	yeah
B	with them
A	I'll have to mention that to Dad actually
B	well when
A	Cos that'll set him off
B	yeah
A	hm
B	I just I
A	mm
B	just want to visit
A	yeah
B	and just give them a hug
A	yeah
B	I don't know take her a card
A	er
B	do you write a card or?
A	huh
B	well I don't mm well that's what she like
A	yeah
B	she loves cards
A	yeah okay
B	but what do you write?
A	I dunno
B	hope you get better soon
B	I mean that's not the kind of card is it
A	I don't know
B	thinking of you
A	that kind of thing
B	yeah
A	um
B	I was talking today with
A	mm
B	I mean they do
A	yeah
B	they are good
A	when's she gotta have her MRI
B	who's having an MRI scan?
B	no she's having a
A	yeah that's after
B	what is MRI?
A	well I dunno
B	I've forgotten
A	hm
B	I don't know
A	but I don't know if that was something to determine
B	I don't know what that is
A	no nor do I
B	yeah
A	but that's in two weeks
B	huh?
A	that's in two weeks' time
B	mm
A	which I don't know how critical it is in getting something
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean I'd hate to be sitting around for two weeks if I'd just been diagnosed with that
B	well wait what else can you do? That's what you've got to do
A	well yeah but
B	you've got to wait
A	if it was private you'd get it done the next day wouldn't you?
B	yeah I was talking to
A	yeah
B	so you literally just have to get um you have to get the the check done
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	er
B	so I was thinking that for some other people as well
A	mm
B	just to get the check out
A	mm
B	and then get your consultancy papers and everything
A	mm
B	every diagnosis that you've got
A	mm
B	there's no point in doing everything through private healthcare because they just
A	no
B	send you through the NHS anyway
A	yeah
B	you just have to pay
A	that's the biggest thing
B	yeah
A	it's getting something done the next week or getting something done in three years' time
B	I was wondering as well you said that they've spent all their money
A	who? What my dad?
B	mm
A	well no they've spent a big part of it
B	whereas
B	now I bet they wish they had the money
A	well yeah
B	well I'm sure they've got some left
A	well he's always been a bit foolish with money really
B	well I think it it should be alright now they've got they've got some
A	yeah
B	to spend
A	yeah
B	oh well
A	yeah um we're I was talking earlier with your mum and dad about the you know that um inoculation they give the thirteen-year-old girls
B	mm
A	that's
B	what's that all about?
A	I thought that was about cervical
B	it is
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but then your mum said it was something to do with Chlamydia
B	no it's not
A	can Chlamydia
B	it's not to do with
A	contribute
B	chlamydia
A	to having cervical cancer?
B	I don't know but I I'm pretty sure it's the cervical cancer jab
A	right
B	that's I don't know what it does
A	well no
B	I don't get it
A	that's a load of bollocks isn't it really?
B	I don't understand it at all
A	it's just a multi-billion pound pharmaceutical
B	mm
A	er push
B	infertility
A	infertility
B	but that's what scares me about
A	evil bastards
B	going getting any test
A	mm
B	done
A	mm
B	messing about with anything
A	yeah well I was reading that thing about all the heavy metals they put in the injections
B	mm
A	and I'm sure that is linked to autism
B	well they say er well
A	Cos that's just gone through the roof
B	on the TV the other day they were saying about the asthma and the eczema rates
A	yeah
B	skyrocketing
A	mm
B	and then they were trying to find all these different excuses as to why but nobody really said anything about these multiple jabs they're giving the babies
A	yeah
B	they're giving them the flu jab and that um um oh the that trio
A	that's MMR not MRI
B	oh
A	yeah
B	giving it to the little babies
A	no
B	I just hope we don't get to the condition like America is and we all get put in prison for neglect if we don't have our babies have jabs
A	yeah
B	that woman in America got
A	well they've
B	done
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	they've literally taken kids off their parents
B	yeah I know
A	well it should be
B	they can't say
A	I dunno
B	no proof that it's it's definitely the right thing to do
A	no
B	yeah
A	things
B	yeah
A	there's no debating that
B	yeah
A	by these companies who are
B	mm
A	and just generating as much money as they can
B	mm
A	ethics takes a backseat really doesn't it
B	mm
A	and the amount of um I dunno experiments they've done through the history
B	yeah
A	and find the amount of times that
B	they've
A	on us
B	yeah
A	well that's yeah that's rumours
B	mm
A	clinically tested
B	but you never know
A	and proven where people have got millions in compensation and stuff
B	mm
A	but they're just all hidden and then anyone who talks about it is a conspiracy theorist or
B	yeah
A	you know it's and to think that that kind of stuff isn't happening now is just it's foolish I think
B	yeah but it's just difficult to know what they're doing it on or what what ones are safe
A	yeah
B	yeah but like you said there are the good ones that stop you getting ill
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	um but I had German measles when I was a kid
A	I don't know
B	can get lots of times
A	hm
B	er you have to research it really so that you know what you're so you know what you're looking at
A	yeah
B	that's
A	mm
B	and if I had it when I was a kid then I can't get it again
A	mm
B	immunize myself
A	mm
B	as far as I know
A	well it's like with these flu jabs as well they push on the old people
B	mm
A	every Christmas
B	yeah
A	I'm sure that kills
A	yeah
B	um
A	do you know what I dunno er I suppose it's personal choice isn't it?
B	well as long as it stays a personal choice
A	yeah
B	then you can
A	exactly
A	India without having a single jab
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	again
A	yeah
B	now that that doctor in Thailand always
A	he
B	told me
A	yeah
B	Cos that
A	mm
B	just went to get them
A	mm
B	I said well what's
A	well that's it
B	Cos we do
A	normal isn't it
B	yeah
B	just in case I
A	it's like what people do
B	I'm outside and I cut myself
A	yeah
B	with a stick
A	A rusty nail
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	tetanus? And I think no
A	I mean sorry
B	and then
A	then you just go along with the the social norm
B	I can't remember the percentage he said but it was really low
A	yeah
B	and and then he said and then like if you do cut yourself with your rusty nail outside or something then you can go and get your tetanus jab
A	mm
B	just as a precaution
A	yeah
B	but what's the point of having it if you haven't?
A	yeah
B	got any infection to begin with
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	hm
B	but I kind of I like that different side of a doctor giving me a different opinion
A	no
B	they just go you need this
A	well I mean
B	stronger
A	they're all drug peddlers
B	mm
B	I know
A	I think you know more
B	even the opticians
A	yeah the opticians as well
B	like they
A	yeah
B	they were  they were  saying to me I
A	mm
B	and then I don't trust them
A	mm
B	it's like you're not listening to what I'm saying
A	mm
B	I'm telling you that my eyesight is worse in one part than the other part
A	or you should at least be interested
B	yes
A	in that you're saying that
B	yeah
A	not just going through her
B	like oh I've never heard that before
A	yeah
B	and look it up and
A	yeah
B	and yeah they should be interested
A	yeah
B	they just
A	they do that and then that's they've got no
B	they just wanna give me stronger and stronger glasses
A	complete
B	I said what if I do my eye exercises
A	they don't work
B	can't improve your
A	no
B	eyesight
A	yeah
B	and he can see almost twenty twenty vision
B	and they said that it's a an effect because
A	not enough
B	he never had enough oxygen
A	yeah
B	going in
A	hm
B	to his brain
A	hm
B	and ages and then when they took it away and he's been feeling better
A	mm
B	and his eyesight I mean they said he was like Spiderman
B	he put on his glasses and he couldn't see
B	it was all blurry
B	was like Spiderman suddenly getting his special powers and
A	did he start climbing the walls?
B	but that goes to show that there is something that you can do to improve your
A	well yeah there's a lot
B	health and your you know
A	beneath the surface
B	that the doctors don't know about
A	that the doctors can't see or we don't know about yet
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	mm
A	I think that's dangerous really
B	I know but it takes a lot to research it
A	yeah it does but
B	that's like these cures
A	that's what people should do I think
B	with Trish like I'd love to say to her oh I've researched this and this
A	yeah
B	um but I don't think people listen to be honest you know
A	no no they don't to be honest
B	I but you should tell them
A	because they don't like it puts them in a position where they they they lose power
B	their beliefs
A	they've got a world view
B	mm
A	if they start questioning that then they they lose their empowerment
B	yeah
A	um to which there usually there isn't an answer anyway
B	yeah
A	but I dunno
B	yeah
A	hm
B	yeah
A	hm
B	you know what I believe in all of these acupressure things and stuff
A	mm
B	but not many other people
A	mm
B	there is
A	yeah
B	and the meditation thing you see
A	no
B	or any
A	no
B	no
A	so there's no point pushing it on people
B	a self belief
A	ah critical thinking
B	what?
A	um
B	mm
A	people don't want to go out and learn how to criticize things to get a a different perspective
B	no
A	in fact they're actively encouraged not to do that
B	they yeah they just want
A	whatever
B	somebody who's who's specialized in that area to tell them what's best
A	yeah
B	for them
A	yeah
B	not to like
A	but the trouble is
B	not to think for themselves
A	when these experts um
B	if they get it right
A	get in positions of extreme power like
B	mm
A	er what's happened now
B	well you can't say that about all of them
A	no
B	mm
A	but that's I think one of the fundamental problems in our society at the moment
B	well you um baby
A	mm
A	yeah well if a doctor tells you your baby needs a jab
B	it's almost like they sell it
A	you do it don't you?
B	I don't think they just tell you
A	mm
B	yeah
A	hm
B	and then people say well you know it's it's free treatment and everybody else says that it's good so we should do it
A	yeah
B	it would be very different if you had to pay for it I'm sure
A	hm
B	I saw a bit of that
A	you saw some of it did you?
B	A little tiny bit
A	it was quite good
B	mm
A	you could imagine them just sitting in their you know their
B	who are they? What?
A	the Barclays brothers
B	oh Barclays
B	yeah
A	going ha ha how can we fuck them over? you know
B	yeah
B	in his mansion
A	yeah
B	really?
A	is amazing
B	they own the whole island
A	yeah
B	weird isn't it?
A	just er the power you know
B	mm
A	it is it's frightening
B	yeah
A	these people have got such an influence
B	yeah
A	and to remove themselves from society themselves shows their kinda
B	or they just need to try and hide away cos otherwise everybody would just get them
B	mm
A	evil bastards
B	that thing that was on the TV this morning that was a bit weird about Barclays having to it's not just Barclays having to pay back all of those insurance things
A	right
B	but I don't really understand that
B	why are they why are the banks? I mean I know it's kind of good that the banks will
A	yeah
B	pay back ordinary people who got tricked into things
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but I'm sorry you
A	but
B	shouldn't be so silly as to
A	yeah
B	buy something and not read the contract
A	yeah I
B	a real trick
A	I don't know about this either
B	if it was a good trick
A	I haven't really read about that
B	I mean that's it is good they're giving money back
A	yeah
B	and they're gonna go through it one by one
A	yeah
B	they've been told to go through it one by one and pay people back money
A	yeah
A	like
B	yeah
A	because of the financial er what's the word? Climate
B	mm
A	they use don't they
B	yeah
A	oh okay well we're giving back to the people
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah but it's all so like then that factory that they're opening up um Nissan
A	Nissan?
B	going yeah it's a
A	Don't know
B	oh I don't know
B	hopefully it will be local people
A	right
B	but they think it's gonna be abroad
A	yeah
B	hang on a minute
A	mm
B	back to England
A	well that's surprising though
B	let's bring back all the jobs
A	hm
B	no but then like it was like a huge
A	yeah
A	I mean the parts will made in
B	like coughing
A	China but usually the assembly is done in the er to do
B	but they
A	assembly would be expensive in England
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	it seemed like
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	it seemed like another story to make people happy
A	yeah
B	mm?
A	I mean well we haven't watched the news in what? Pff
B	I watch the news every day
A	well we watch it
B	I flick through all those different channels
A	well since we've been back we have
B	we yeah but you
A	do you know what I mean? I have to completely remove
B	er
A	myself from watching it
B	and just research on the internet
A	and just kind of analyze it as you watch it
B	no
A	well you can't though
B	mm
A	on the internet is the best thing
B	I was trying to flick through all the different channels and like look at RT and then at
A	yeah well that's a good start
B	fRANCE 24 and
A	get a good cross-section
B	I like the Euronews
A	Al Jazeera
B	programme
A	yeah
B	the breakfast programme I mean
A	yeah
B	Euronews Breakfast
A	yeah I like RT
B	I don't know
A	although they're extremely biased
B	I like RT
A	obviously
B	but I don't like
A	but
B	exactly
A	but they say things er that no other news
B	yeah that's true
A	that's why I like them
B	mm
A	they're not  they're not  scared of saying it
A	even Al Jazeera is completely you know western orientated really
B	yeah
A	even though it shows images that are quite gory
B	yeah
A	but when you look a lot of their stories
B	it's not
A	it isn't
B	no
A	yeah
B	the Tunisians were really upset
A	yeah
B	with them
A	yeah
B	the Al Jazeera TV
A	no
B	why they thought  they thought
A	no they're in bed with the western media
B	they'd be on their side
A	hm
B	no
A	hm
B	yeah?
B	what on?
A	I'm getting desperate for money
B	no they just play bingo
B	mm
A	and it showed me a load of adverts
B	yeah I hate that advert
A	doing Vodafone
B	I hate that so much
B	sold himself out or something
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos though er
B	yeah
A	who
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	how does that relate to England? And then
B	I know it's sad isn't it
A	is oh I I just find it sickening
B	yeah
A	how did she know
B	yeah she's like looking at little
A	I mean everyone knows Yoda
B	yeah looking at Yoda
A	yeah
B	as if he's a normal person
A	yeah
B	how did he do
A	I dunno it just irritates me
B	yeah
A	that kind of stuff
B	I think they pitched that all wrong
A	all wrong man
B	completely
A	I can see half the country
B	I don't know who that
A	screaming at that advert
B	yeah
A	going oh you fucking leave Yoda alone
B	yeah
A	he's one of the coolest people
B	yeah but they must have bought the rights to Yoda or something
A	yeah they
B	mustn't they?
A	must have spent millions on that
B	they must have bought the
A	yeah
B	to have Yoda on there
A	I reckon they're trying to change their image
B	Don't know
A	I reckon they're trying to make themselves look cool
A	um
B	are they German company?
A	Vodafone
B	I don't  I don't  know
A	oh no that's Ericsson that's
B	I don't know actually
A	Vodafone
B	maybe they are American
A	er no I don't know
B	mm
A	stupid bastards anyway aren't they?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I keep getting sucked into it
A	oh
B	Don't know
A	yeah
B	of all those chat shows and stuff
A	yeah well that's the new trend isn't it?
B	I really had trouble watching the TV when we first came back
A	mm
B	and I don't know what it is
A	it sucks you in doesn't it?
B	it like my habit of like in the evening started watching TV and
A	yeah
B	like we didn't even have a TV before so it's I don't know why this is a new habit of ours
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	yeah but these yeah these flashing graphics which are the trend like like I said before I think it's the the HDTV
B	yeah
A	that they're just trying to brighten everything
B	but it's not oo it's it's
A	well it's not
B	mm
A	it's
B	mm
A	and even like these chat shows
B	yeah
A	they're just moving
B	they always seem to be blue
A	and they're all slowly moving and morphing and changing shape
B	I wonder if it's like some sort of hypnosis thing
B	no seriously
A	maybe it is
B	well there was  there was  this one programme they really
A	yeah
B	er the banker
A	yeah he's got it as well
B	but he's got
A	everyone's got it
B	a round like a a round and it really is like a hypnosis thing
A	yeah
B	and you're thinking oh dear Max you're resorting to hypnosis for people to
B	listen to you or something
A	yeah
B	so I well
A	but TV doesn't even have to do that because
B	but it is hypnotic
A	because TV um it was it alpha
B	mm?
A	alpha
B	oh
A	it puts your brain into a state
B	er
A	that you're in
B	beta I thought
A	when you're sleeping
B	yeah
A	is it beta?
B	or theta theta
A	I can't remember
B	alpha is awake
A	right
B	it's either beta or theta
A	same when you are dreaming
B	yeah
A	which makes you more suggestible
B	mhm
A	mm
B	yeah and that's what I think all these
A	are just trying to
B	they're just trying to enhance it
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure about that
B	well I wish they'd get rid of it
A	mm
B	mind you I shouldn't be watching TV anyway
A	yeah well huh you know we're staying round someone else's house effectively and you fit into
B	well I know but
A	their routines don't you?
B	no but I feel like I should be up doing stuff but
A	yeah but if you're up doing stuff in the time that they sit down to watch TV
B	well that's um
A	then you're being rude
B	oh
A	because you're not spending time with them
B	mm
A	that's the problem
B	yeah well
A	isn't it?
B	do you want another drink?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	can I have a pint of er John Smith's please?
B	yeah
A	I'll turn that off
