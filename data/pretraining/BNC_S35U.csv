A	they tried to accuse me of stealing it
B	oh yeah
A	and I had a bloody
B	oh yeah

B	you should've kicked up a fuss
C	yeah
B	you had a receipt
A	yeah

A	I'm sure they get stolen from them quite a lot
B	yeah but not by people who have receipts who actually buy
A	yeah
B	the shirt
C	where's this? Sports Direct?
A	mm
C	yeah
A	I don't think it was forty quid

D	ripped out the the security tag
C	are you still doing that text?
A	I don't think I did have the receipt
D	no it's another one
C	oh
A	I think that's why they were so annoyed

A	forty-five degree heat
D	mm

A	Kimi Rikknen
A	and I went such a strange thing that you you know these things
A	before I even knew
C	oh
A	oh
B	isn't there another Rikknen?
A	he's the F1 driver
D	I
A	Kimi Rikknen

D	I dunno
B	mm
A	it's the only one that's been in F1
A	well
D	oh okay
A	and then he left
D	oh maybe that's that's it
A	and now he's come back this year
D	then
B	maybe it is Kimi
D	we remember it from then
A	yeah
B	mm
A	he did win it in two thousand and seven
B	is it it's like Mansell

B	right
A	Cos he would've started F1 when he was twenty-four or something like that
B	mm
A	and then he went right through till he was thirty-four
D	uh
A	the strange thing I thought is he left er Ferrari after winning nine years in a row or however long

C	the
D	if there was a serious problem they'd want him out though

C	probably
D	in the garage?
C	I was  I was  just thinking about that
D	the thing that
C	mm
D	so it's all
C	oh well
D	piled on top of each other
C	I know
D	you've had it
C	well I really would like the
D	I've just
C	I think the speakers are in there as well
D	yes
D	I wondered what was in a bag and and
C	okay
D	Cos you said I don't wanna pack those away
C	I think it's in there somewhere
D	where would you have put it though?
C	Don't know
D	but something as delicate as that
C	it's not delicate
D	huh
C	mm
D	you know
C	let's not think about it till the morning
D	okay
C	um
D	but I would like to have some of your pictures on my wall
C	I'm sure I can find those
D	I would love to do that
C	I think there's a big um
D	well I've got
C	what did I put them in?
D	the big one of
C	mm
D	oh yeah
D	so in your on your little break you could er get on with something that you're
C	well I have I've got
D	mm
C	a
D	yeah?
C	which is um yeah
D	I do remember
D	aw
C	of him and his wife
C	er not financially brilliant
D	oh really?
C	yeah
C	which is handy at the minute
D	so it might be worth doing
C	yeah
D	yep
C	so you know
D	that's very good
C	which is very ruthless of me but you know
D	no
C	I haven't really you know
D	see you're too nice
C	it's a shame that I got to that point with Hastings where er you know the flat was sort of
D	tut I know
C	I had a studio up the road
D	I know
C	crashing down on me
D	I know
C	life eh
D	yeah
C	mm interesting
D	I certainly think
C	oh
D	that bit at the bottom that you could actually have a solidly brick
C	build a
D	a brick or at least you know
C	you could er there's er
D	air brick
C	no but you need planning permission
D	not air brick um what's the word called? Breeze block
C	yeah
D	um
C	you need planning permission though
D	oh yeah but I'm sure I'd get it
D	for a studio
C	for a studio at the bottom of the garden
D	absolutely
C	of course they do
D	every other house in um certain areas
C	you could build a bloody house there
D	er has got
C	if you came in a bit
D	every other house in in you know Romsey and those sorts of places
C	mm
D	have got a studio at the bottom of the garden
C	no
D	well it
C	mm
D	for people um
C	mm
D	staying
D	yeah
C	well power yeah I mean mm
D	I don't know how you'd do that
C	just put a cable under the ground and
D	yeah
D	yeah you'd need
C	er I was just thinking that I haven't bought a lottery ticket yet but
C	Cos um building a house there on my wages would be
D	well I mean it's a nice idea
C	mm
D	I'm sure somebody could do it
D	er of course
B	another project
D	I'm I'm sure they would
B	on the  on the  lot
D	absolutely
C	it depends
D	but if it's  if it's
B	it'd be single storey
D	single storey
C	well it could be the height that it is now really
D	absolutely
B	like the fence
C	mm
D	and er just a slightly pitched roof
C	yeah
D	so long as it's not completely flat
C	well you'd have it just going one way
D	yeah
B	mm
D	exactly
C	and have an apex roof
D	oh absolutely
C	mm
D	yeah
B	A house that I went to look at recently had a studio little
D	yeah
B	outhouse shed but
D	well Dido's got one
B	much nicer
C	mm
D	at the bottom of hers
B	yeah and it
D	yeah
B	Cos you had a second room with like a bedroom bathroom
D	oh right
B	yeah
D	wow
B	it was really nice
D	yeah
B	the guy who owns the house
C	you could I mean that would I dunno be a couple of thousand pounds worth of timber to
D	I mean if you didn't want to move it's er it's there's plenty of room
D	losing anything off the garden
C	just build your own house
D	well
D	I'm
C	yeah
D	I mean a lot of men like a kind of project like that
C	mm
D	so
D	well that's no but it'd look nice
C	but wood would be nice
B	Wood would be really nice
D	well it would but you'd have to treat it and keep it
C	not really
D	you know
C	mm
D	well you do
C	no well you buy a treated timber
D	mm
B	Wood with those doors that slide
C	oo
B	along
D	mm
B	so the whole of the front would open
D	I that would be very nice
C	yeah
D	mm
B	solar panels
D	yeah
D	yeah
B	Cos that would run that and probably your house
D	and then
B	and they you could sell it back to the grid
D	er actually yeah
B	power from here
D	it would actually be going that way
B	yeah
D	Cos I've got nowhere to put
C	mm
D	solar panels on this
C	no
D	so it would be quite good
B	so all of the roof could be solar panelling
D	absolutely
B	you could put it and obviously that's the end that gets the most sun
C	are they
D	it does
C	do they still doing grants for it
D	the government have just cut them all back
B	of course
C	mm
B	but you can get
D	but I'm not gonna it's not gonna happen like in the next
D	so
C	no I was thinking of buying some tobacco and a lottery ticket
D	oh
C	so you never know
B	and a few thousand pounds worth of timber anyway
C	well that was after the lottery ticket
C	mm
B	nice
C	hm
D	I mean the odds are obviously ridiculous
C	somebody wins
D	somebody's got to win it
C	yeah
D	and somebody does
C	well it's the odds are bumping into a complete stranger and guessing their phone number
B	really?
B	Good
C	you know
D	oh right
D	really? There are more numbers in a phone number
C	well
D	oh
C	six figure number
D	okay
C	but then
C	it's kind of true isn't it
D	yeah
C	and the odds are exactly the the odds are that the same chance that it turn up one two three four five six
D	yeah
C	as any other numbers
D	yeah exactly
C	bizarre really
D	well of course
C	very few people get a lot of money
D	exactly
C	it does sort of make very few millionaires
D	oh darling
B	mm
C	oh don't get poorly
B	mm
D	I think it's probably time to go indoors
B	mm
C	have a lie down for an hour or so till till you have to drive off and pick up
B	I think if I go to sleep I won't will never get up again
C	well lie and watch something
C	have a little rest
B	what's the time?
C	it's five o'clock
D	mm
B	okay
D	we have
C	is she allowed to turn off the music and watch something?
D	we have a
C	mm
D	no
C	mm
D	in what we watch
D	um
C	pretty similar
D	agree with a lot of
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	mm
D	but it's quite tricky finding something for everyone to you know that we agree on
C	oh I did see the most bizarre film on this free channel
C	er Nicole Kidman
D	mm
C	who I think is quite astonishing actually
D	I like her in certain things
C	she's in this she's amazing
D	yeah
C	his name
D	when was it made?
C	Don't know
D	yeah
C	um
B	it's a bit like Benjamin Button I suppose is it?
C	A little bit
D	I haven't seen that
C	in that way
D	er I mean I I know the idea but
C	but and the kid is absolutely fantastic
B	so how old is he then? He what age is he playing
C	about fourteen or something like that
B	oh
C	no it's it it's kind of
B	did it look like it was quite old?
C	no
B	mm
C	I'd know that
D	how how long ago do you think it was made?
C	it's quite hard to tell
D	uh
C	within the last ten years maybe? I don't know
D	I mean I don't know a lot of her
C	is there a list of titles
D	yeah
B	it won't be anything recent I don't think
C	right
B	Cos it doesn't ring a bell with me
D	well she's been making films for a long time
C	I think it didn't er I think it possibly didn't do very well
D	how old did she look?
C	film channels
D	did she look?
D	okay
C	no er The Interpreter I've seen
D	yeah
C	ten-year-old boy
D	A reincarnation of her dead husband
C	yeah
D	how bizarre
C	yeah
B	who directed it?
C	oh
D	Jonathan Glazer
B	mm
D	I know the name but I dunno what else he's done
B	how peculiar
D	this is very odd
B	who's the fella? Her new husband
D	Cameron Bright
B	mm
D	dunno
B	is it from a play? Cos the name sounds familiar
D	no
C	it's very clever because um obviously everyone's like hysterical about it
D	two thousand and four
C	don't be so absolutely ridiculous
B	mm
C	the more freaky it gets
B	my God
C	and it it's kind of what in God's name is happening here? It's like he can't be right
D	that's weird
C	it's very very clever
D	when was this on then?
C	but it's all in her
D	mm
B	no I want to watch it
C	it's kind of
D	I've never even heard of it
C	no
B	sounds interesting
D	oh so er two thousand and four
C	two thousand and four?
D	yeah
C	okay
D	well
C	hm
D	doo doo doop
B	it's here
D	can you pass the old
B	stretch
D	can't reach
B	stretch
D	can't reach
B	stretch a bit more
D	things in the way
D	things in the way
B	stretch a bit more
D	no I can't
B	mm
D	mm
C	actually
D	they're in the garage
C	are they? There's loads
D	yeah
C	it's ridiculous
D	I know
C	er
D	it's good to do that
C	but I've lent a few out
D	oh and you don't know where? I know I
D	I always swear I'm never gonna lend people anything
C	because I thought I remember Performance as being a quirky film
D	mm
C	with Mick Jagger
D	it definitely is
C	and
B	mm
D	James Fox
C	but when I watched it again I thought bloody hell
C	it's very good
D	I haven't seen it for years
C	much more powerful than I thought it would be
D	yeah?
C	really good
D	I haven't seen it for years and years  and years
C	and I was talking to
D	mm
C	rubbish in their house
D	mm
C	I can't  I can't  even think what's in there
D	er you you bought quite a few when you were in Saudi
C	oh yeah
D	needed to watch something
C	yeah
D	mm
C	I wonder what I've got there
D	oh right
C	that's pretty powerful
D	yeah
C	it's not very
D	no it's not
C	it's not jolly watching
D	no
C	um
D	mm
C	just in a room
D	huh
C	have you seen it?
D	it's brilliant
C	and he's he's er
D	yes
C	it's amazing
D	it's absolutely amazing
C	and they're just locked in this room together
D	yes
C	and it's just dialogue
D	oh it is so good
C	oh well I've got that
D	and I saw it there and I thought oh that's weird
C	I've got that in the shed
D	oh er
B	sounds good though
D	God knows what it's called
B	I'd love to watch it
D	it is really good
C	there's some
B	really?
D	absolutely brilliant
C	Cos he's talking about alcohol
B	mm
D	yeah
C	he says you know my friend he just stepped out one day you know because of alcohol stepped out one day in front of a car
B	oh
C	and it's got this very fast
C	kind of snappy dialogue all the way through
D	he's not my favourite actor but he's made
C	oh they're both brilliant
D	a couple of films that are really good
C	I love both of them
D	uh
C	and the two of them together just like arguing in this room
D	but they're arguing about you know they're having a real existential debate
B	mm
D	the Sunset Limited
C	yeah
B	oh so the play is called two-hander?
D	no no no er I mean it's er sorry it's it's a play with two people
B	I've just never heard that expression
D	have you not?
B	no
D	oh okay
C	well
D	it's two people
C	just two people
D	oh it's written by Cormac McCarthy
B	oh
D	I should've realized
C	I had never heard of it
D	two men in an apartment with er opposing beliefs
C	yeah
D	it is er so well-written
C	shall I have a look in it before the light goes? In the
B	yay
C	plough through
D	do you wanna have a look? Er yeah we could do that
C	well no I don't mind
D	well it'd be quite nice to see actually no cos we'd have to lock everywhere up so
D	I hope to God there hasn't been any leaks
C	well
D	I do remember though that things were piled
C	I can have an idea about tomorrow
D	oh okay
C	um
D	Good luck
C	hm
B	I don't think anyone's been in the garage since then have they?
D	well it'd be quite nice cos cos we all
C	oh well never mind
B	you wouldn't be able to get in the garage
D	no
C	mm
D	because you we piled it up
C	yeah
B	oh that's true
D	so neatly
B	yeah
D	um
C	alright
D	yeah
C	well I'll go and have a look in a minute

D	no he's not
C	yeah
D	very pleased to have you here
C	oh
D	he does
C	quite calm and settled and
D	he does at the moment
C	and he's thinking about work next week as well
D	he is
B	that'll be really good for him
D	it would
C	it will
B	to have a reason to you know to to structure his day
D	exactly
C	no he
B	mm
D	yeah
C	you know
B	well it's independence as well
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	he and dad spend a lot of time together which is great cos they get on so well
C	yeah
B	but
D	but it's nice to have other things
B	be good to have a break
C	but then
D	exactly
C	but then he won't be reliant on his dad for money and you know
B	absolutely
D	I mean it's only a basic wage but still it's
C	well it's a bit of pocket money for him
D	exactly
B	it's money that he's earned isn't it
C	he hasn't got overheads
D	no
C	hasn't gotta earn his rent or
D	no
C	you know
D	yeah
C	which would be for whatever
D	mm
C	that'll be a test won't it

B	the more he does the more active he is the more
D	and that's
B	he will stay away from the drugs
D	well I think that's true
C	well that's it
D	and er he'll also be tired
B	mm
D	so he won't be awake all night thinking and you know worrying
B	mm
