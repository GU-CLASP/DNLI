A	no
B	they're very or
A	oh
A	oh as in Kinder egg?
B	yeah like a with the bar things in it
A	oh
B	and then it just I dunno how many they put in but it was just so so good
A	oh
B	but it's just oh the amount of cream and
B	chocolate bars and
A	this is the thing about
A	when you when you go places with a girl that's like that's an excuse to just go and have a milkshake
B	yeah have the most feminine thing possible
A	yeah
B	just like I can have a cocktail if I want I can have a really pink cocktail
A	do you think there are
unknown_female	so like if say if you were having a a meal at
B	mm
A	what would you choose? would it would it be different what you choose if you were going out with me and and
B	no probably not
A	and
B	er erm
A	that is the sign of a true man
B	think I'd just have the meatiest thing possible
unknown_female	regardless of who I was with
B	since erm do you remember me and
A	yeah
B	that's the first time I ever went and since then I've had so many GBKs it's er just
B	it's so yeah it's like twelve pounds a burger? and you've gotta pay for the chips and a drink but I mean it's worth it
A	I always I
B	oh really?
A	but maybe that was just a quiet
B	the one I had recently was called The Mighty just like two
A	and eggs?
B	I don't think there was eggs
A	hash browns
B	just everything it was just
A	baked beans

A	yeah how was it?
B	not as good as I thought it'd be
A	oh
B	it was a bit
A	was it like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
B	mm partially but I would say Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is much better
A	oh okay
B	yeah it kind of seemed like it's set up for a sequel
A	okay yeah
B	dunno why just the way it ended the way it went kind of just seemed a bit like like the plot itself ended but there were so many things
A	mm
B	seeing as it's based on a book I can't imagine a book ended like that
A	yeah
B	well dunno haven't read the book
B	yeah maybe it was like the original Great Expectations ending
A	yeah
B	that doesn't isn't meant to see
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	which I think's more realistic I prefer that
A	it does seem like it's that was was that our first year we learnt that?

B	the way he hit it it was just phenomenal
A	did you er did you want them to win? or Crystal Palace?
B	oh I wanted Crystal Palace to win
A	kind of classic underdog
B	yeah that is I just don't like Man United
A	yeah mm yeah
A	but I think it's good that Louis van Gaal gets a er bit of season
B	he's been sacked hasn't he?
A	has he has he really?
A	no way
B	he got sacked the morning after
A	no I didn't realise that
B	yeah erm I think José Mourinho is gonna replace him
A	that'd be interesting
B	yeah
A	oh I'm not sure I like that
B	I don't think he'll do a very good job
A	what will Mourinho be like at
B	I dunno
A	I don't think anyone will like him cos
B	they didn't like van Gaal because he was too defensive
A	and they didn't like
B	and
A	David Moyes because he was rubbish
B	yeah and Mourinho is so
A	no I think it's been so much better in the past hasn't it?
B	yeah
A	I just don't I don't
B	I assume it would be not that he needs the money
A	no
B	yeah no I really like Klopp oh
A	there must be some way of getting your
B	huh?
A	erm yeah I like Klopp
B	oh
A	oh
B	he's at City isn't he next year?
A	he's at City next year I think
B	yeah yeah
A	I think Mourinho would do well at City
B	erm
A	but then I I know nothing about it
B	I probably wanted erm City to have a qualifier for the Champions League
A	did they qualify this year?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	has always had well he
A	yeah
B	which I can't imagine was a difficult team to manage just played the best eleven and then Suárez well Suárez was another time but
A	but just like
B	do what he wants
A	it was so good yeah Schweini I mean he's
B	he's in United
A	yeah Schweinsteiger's at United
B	Xabi Alonso what a player
A	do you back erm
A	do you back er Leicester for the title next year?
B	no
A	it's crazy how erm
B	I think next year will be so open
A	yeah it's crazy how different it is the year after
B	mm yeah
unknown_female	finished what? ninth?
B	yeah eighth ninth
A	who's it
B	yeah I'm not quite sure if he's gonna stay
A	oh come on Edwards oh

A	yeah
B	is ridiculously high
A	yeah
B	oh
A	erm June or something
B	oh
A	the end of June
B	the end of June?
A	yeah

B	yeah
A	oh okay yeah
B	with George Clooney and
A	yeah oh mate that looks good
B	it looks so good doesn't it? it's not out
A	so what's the? the premise of it is like he's
B	some guy got stitched up lost all his money tries to have like a terrorist situation on live TV or
A	yeah
B	it just seems like a really nice really good not nice but you know what I mean like
A	yeah
B	really heartwarming premise
A	a family film
B	such a family film no
B	er it just seems like a really interesting premise to a story
A	mm
B	I assume so but they're sorority rather than er
unknown_female	whatever the male equivalent's called fraternity
A	oh okay yeah
B	yeah?
A	erm I think it's getting close to one of my friends like potentially could do it in in the next like six months or something
B	okay
A	could get married so
B	yeah?
A	if I was ever to organise one I was just thinking about it what oh
B	I have absolutely no idea
A	my idea at the moment is a er
B	okay
A	erm
A	give him the
B	yeah?
A	erm and then he has to get from one place to another place with his trusty band of followers
A	just embarrass him and he has to do like a sequence of challenges on his way
B	okay
A	like Lord of the Rings themed so I'm I like I just can't remember enough about Lord of the Rings to do it I was just thinking of it yesterday but what kind of things could I like include? I was thinking maybe having a meal where he has to order something like you know the chips?
B	yeah?
A	he has cos there's a scene isn't there? where they
B	erm
A	erm I think like going er across a lake on go across a lake on his own he has to choose someone as Samwise Gamgee
B	there's a song they sing as there's a song they sing isn't there? Merry and Pip do on the tables
A	oh yeah erm
B	you could make him do that
B	the one thing that stands out in my mind is when they first go to the the pub to find erm when they first meet Aragorn
A	yeah
B	and erm one of them comes back with like a pint
A	oh yeah
B	what's that?
B	that my friend is a pint they serve it in pints?
B	I'm getting one you've got a whole half already
B	just I dunno why
B	on a mountain
A	on a mountain
B	where are you taking him?
A	I dunno
A	just up a mountain
B	Snowdonia?
A	we could do it at Snowdonia though that'd be cool
B	what? you're just gonna start a fight
A	a huge fight would be amazing
A	I've no I've never been in a fight actually
B	well no nor have I
A	well there was lots of ones at
B	oh yeah no er
A	oh yeah they used to like
A	oh
B	oh
A	yeah
A	but you never used to get involved did you?
B	no no I was out one night when it happened nothing happened I was just there but
B	to see if anything actually happened nothing happened oh what's this?
B	beautiful
unknown_female	it's so such a dangerous concept this isn't it?
B	yeah
A	have you er have you read anything? oh
B	no I really wanna finish erm
B	this book I started reading over Easter er my friend got it for my birthday er and I just wanna finish it but I just haven't got round to actually starting it
A	and what's which one is it?
B	er The Liar by Stephen Fry
A	oh okay
B	it's quite good actually I'm er halfway through but
A	cos he's an interesting man isn't he? he's like
B	I really like he's
A	really?
B	who can blame him?
A	yeah
B	I'm not
A	is it an autobiography?
B	no no I'm not really sure I think er I'm it's like
A	okay
B	he's gay at like he's
A	okay
B	erm
A	bit like us really
B	and
A	we don't plagiarise
B	honourable students
A	the best kind of student
B	and erm he claims to find like a a manuscript by Dickens of another book that Dickens
A	okay oh yeah
A	oh okay yeah
B	the Dickens book
A	it sounds like it could be written about Stephen Fry
B	mm maybe potentially actually
A	who is this guy?
A	erm yeah that sounds interesting actually
B	yeah it's quite good what about you? have you started reading anything?
A	erm
B	oh the history of the English language?
A	history of the English language yeah
B	should've just studied the module
A	I should've done
A	it's by a guy called David Crystal did you come across David Crystal?
B	no I know er who Crystal is though
A	he's quite influential isn't he? he's quite a big big name
B	he's he's professor at the University of South Wales isn't he?
A	is he?
B	I think so
A	let me check this out
B	oh
unknown_female	oh
A	erm I didn't realise he was the professor at the University of South Wales
B	I think he is
B	don't quote me on that
A	done well for himself
B	but I'm
A	why didn't we go there mate?
B	cos
B	yeah no he's huge
A	who would you most
A	like to meet out of all the people we've erm
A	erm oh erm both
B	both?
A	cos I can't really I can't really like think of any in
B	erm
A	language
B	well like authors?
A	yeah authors or like theorists or
B	mm
A	be so weird wouldn't it?
B	yeah
A	I dunno what it
B	I went erm to the have you been to the Globe?
A	erm yeah
B	did you have like a tour thing? when you go round and you sit down and the man gives you like a little talk?
A	erm
B	oh okay
A	I was just thinking that
B	and apparently Shakespeare used to be like this big broady oh nothing
A	mm
B	like fighting and used to go round and beat people up and go to the pub and get pissed
A	really?
B	and just be like this
A	really?
A	bit like Ben Jonson?
B	yes yeah yeah yeah exactly actually yeah
A	that's really interesting
B	er
A	mate I'll let you do this
B	maybe James Joyce
A	I'll let you go down the thing
B	cos er he's Irish
A	okay yeah
B	I can imagine he'd be a good laugh at the pub
A	yeah I imagine he'd be the Irish always are
B	it's really nice
A	would you like some? would you like some? actually
B	oh
A	it's a little bit cold but you can have some
B	yeah I'd love some thank you
A	okay
B	it's really nice actually
A	it's really tasty isn't it? erm
A	I think the best literature lad on a night out probably would be I think James Joyce'd be too much like have too much intellectual chat
B	too much abstract
A	Shakespeare would be funny
B	yeah
A	Oscar Wilde would be hilarious
A	erm
B	Dickens would be quite funny
A	yeah Dickens would be quite funny got a lot
A	probably got a lot of money to spend as well
B	oh he
A	at least now anyway
B	he was like
A	yeah yeah so he'd know everyone
B	oh what's his name? John Clare
A	oh John Clare er oh yeah oh what a guy
A	erm
A	erm
B	that's who I'd wanna be
A	how about Lord Byron?
A	yeah
A	in Turkey did you ever read The Last Man?
B	yeah
A	and did you read it all the way through?
B	no
A	oh okay
B	I read half
A	which bit did you get up to?
B	the bit where they go to oh when thingy goes he just walks into the city by himself
A	oh yeah
A	I think that is quite near the end yeah
B	that was really good oh
A	oh my goodness
B	my goodness
A	I don't like the sound of that erm
B	erm I haven't read Frankenstein
A	do you
B	so I've I know loads of people
A	you haven't?
B	who've been like it's not as good as Frankenstein but I'm sure that's plainly obvious seeing as I only ever thought Frankenstein Mary Shelley only wrote Frankenstein
A	yeah
A	yeah
unknown_female	I thought it was quite bitty cos the it starts off about like erm
B	yeah
A	erm
B	I thought I haven't read the end but I quite like the premise if people died quicker
A	yeah
B	and that the last half of the book would be just the one person I think that'd be quite like a
A	yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah
B	and then just go and feel like a mix of emotions and experiences and just being but like
B	yeah
A	cos it felt like he actually wasn't the last man for ages it wasn't a book about the last man
B	no
A	it was just
A	like about him and his life
B	yeah
A	which was interesting but it wasn't really
B	yeah what's the other one? have you read The Road? or seen The Road?
A	no
B	erm can't remember who it's written by but the film's got the same guy who played Aragorn
B	and it's just him and his like son and they're just like it's like a post-
A	okay
B	and they just come across like bandits and like quite dark and it's just them
A	yeah
B	trying to get to the other end of the road
A	okay
B	kind of thing
A	and it could you make a er a very decent erm stag do out of it?
B	might be a bit dark
B	I think they I think they eat someone at one point
A	oh really?
B	so you
B	if you you know
B	who am I to pass judgement? but
B	on the on the stag do if you wanna do that okay
B	a stag do?
B	no I don't know anyone who's
A	mm
B	no one's been married in the last three years so
B	thank you
A	even though I'm not sure whether
B	I'm sure
A	oh sorry sorry
B	that's alright
A	actually you might you might be the first
B	I doubt it
A	you probably will be out of like the whole lecture theatre
A	back yourself
A	or okay if you're
B	er it's really difficult erm like I kind of wish I did like a science or something cos they just like everyone I know who does a science just knows everyone on their course
A	yeah it'd be
B	like
A	so they know so many more people in the university
B	yeah it's just with like ours it's we don't have any compulsory modules so you kind of
A	mm
B	make friends and the friends you do make you kind of you stick to don't you?
A	yeah
B	and then if you have different modules you kind of just everyone kind of just sits there in their own little
A	yeah
B	spot and you go and sit next to someone in a seminar and they kind of look at you a bit funny and you say hello and it's like hi you alright it's just a bit
B	I'm just trying to be friendly
B	yeah it's just
A	there's this one girl I do want to talk to is the erm
A	er
B	does she not wash her clothes?
B	is it the same stripy top every day?
