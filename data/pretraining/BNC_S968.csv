D	I always like to think
A	well well well I've lost I've lost to the
C	all your little tactics you've got
D	why? that's what you wanna do
C	I tried to be a bit more tactical this time and it kind of worked out but not really
C	I tried to identify where the hotspots were gonna be
A	I was doing this right and I was doing quite happy with myself and then
C	I had to go round and around to get mine
A	what a nightmare
C	that's why you were like you were coming out of everywhere in Paris I was like yeah I know

B	probably not
C	I never liked Monopoly
A	my dad got er
B	that was a Waddingtons game
A	there's this thing now called Risk Legacy which we bought my dad for Christmas about a year ago it's like when you conquer a territory for the first time you get to name it and you write on the board the name of it and then it's the third person who gets like
C	I always imagine it took a lot of like fathoming out
A	it's long it's really long
B	no I don't think I used to play it when I was like ten or something
C	really?
A	but yeah it can go on for a while
B	it's a really nice tree that one there
D	I don't know what's the actual rules of Monopoly

C	I used to hate I used to hate that it was one of the only board games that we had cos I just didn't enjoy it in any way
B	I wouldn't say I ever really enjoyed it
D	probably cos you were playing with me
C	I just think nowadays where there where there's so many other good board games

D	yeah I know
B	it's just too long for people to play while they wait
D	that's why I wanna look at this app I think that app
C	the app's really good
D	the only thing that puts me off a bit about playing the computer are things like that they can do you over can't they on like the turn up cards and things like that?

C	or
B	talking about
A	that's massive isn't it?
G	what big boys?
C	like big beetle things
B	oh
unknown_female	bloody hell
B	hello pal
G	what's the matter?
B	I thought you'd gone to sleep
C	how are you not asleep?
D	right mate where do you wanna sit?
D	you wanna sit there?
unknown_female	there
D	sit come and sit with me then
unknown_female	yeah
D	right
G	you were nearly asleep weren't you darling?
D	he is tired but it's last day of the holiday well night so
A	right ready then? this is really easy right?
unknown_female	yeah
A	yeah? are you ready
unknown_female	yeah
A	good boy okay right so we're all gonna have like these piles of cards in front of us and they're all gonna be face down when it comes to you you've gotta turn it this way out right? so the table sees it before you do not this way like that but this way you put it face down and the next person will put it face down when you've got two symbols that are matching doesn't matter about the colour the symbols have gotta be matching if you and another person have got the same card with the same symbol you've gotta take the totem pole and the person who doesn't take the totem pole when they should has got to collect all the cards that have gone down
G	a bit like snap
A	a little bit like snap you wanna get rid of your cards right? but if you make a mistake cos they look really similar that's the problem that they like that and that is not the same they look really similar in the heat of the moment
G	yeah
A	so say I put that down
A	apart from that there's three magic cards so whenever you see that arrows going in that means everyone has a free throw to take the totem pole and the person who wins can decide how the cards are divided up right?
D	okay
A	so that's like everyone in right? all in
D	so only has to be one of them?
A	yeah and then you all go in
D	yeah
A	this means that just I'll explain it when it happens
A	so don't do anything I'll explain it when it happens and this means the only thing that's gotta be the same now is the colour so if I do that
D	yeah
A	me and
D	so you two have got yeah
A	so only colours now and we're both trying to take a totem pole
B	Jesus
A	you can
C	it's really simple
B	really simple but
A	it really is
B	not for half past twelve and a bottle of red wine it's not

A	okay put your cards face down then
A	right and you gotta push er you gotta when you turn them over you've gotta turn them over like that right? so the
B	so what? when are we snatching the totem?
C	when it matches somebody else's
A	when you've got the same you've got the same card as someone else exactly the same symbol
B	like that's like
