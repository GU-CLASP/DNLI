A	oh
B	might be in his water bowl
B	dear did you manage
A	no but I will do it this evening
B	like you to otherwise we'll end up in one of those situations where
B	be like awkward
A	I was rather thinking that
B	that's why you've got to
A	yes that's why I've got to do it
B	put the ball back on their side of the court
A	yes
B	doesn't mean we're suddenly best friends and we've got to have supper every day but
A	no but I am free
B	it means we er we don't have to feel like
A	no a
B	ashamed
A	a bit awkward no but erm I am free this week to meet up so we could do something this week
B	well we can suggest it of course this weekend we're not
A	this weekend we've got
B	this
B	and Sunday we've got
A	your mum what's happening on Sunday?
B	oh mum's here but I'm off on Monday I booked that holiday
A	yes well there's actually essentially there's nothing actually happening on Sunday is there?
B	that's the point I'm making and I'm off
A	but your mum is there and you're off on Monday I know
B	my mum's here yeah
A	we could
A	then she'd take over
B	what a lot of questions she'd have
A	excited
B	oh good
A	is going to be about three thousand two hundred
B	yes
B	not the
A	yeah three thousand two hundred
B	I got the gist
A	quite a lot considering how little I've earned
B	yes
A	mm
B	erm now on Saturday mum will be driving over but I want to go out and watch why has that wheel come off the chair?
A	cos I just moved it
B	I want to watch the Calcutta Cup rugby game England Scotland
A	what time is?
B	which doesn't kick off until sixteen fifty
A	does that mean I'm stuck at
B	or you make your own way later in the day and don't
A	oh
B	turn up till like six or sevenish
A	I think this was last year that I had that toothache wasn't it?
B	well you come up with that may have been your
B	last year
A	that actually was not that was
B	and on a sort of similar theme if you want to send flowers to your mum you probably need to think about
A	about now
B	ordering them
A	yeah
B	sooner rather than later
A	cos that will get that particular guilt trip
B	uhu
A	so what's been happening I've been just lying in bed worrying about everything because I can't sleep and then you worry cos you can't you can't sleep so you start worrying about stuff because you're awake cos you're worrying about stuff cos you're awake you can't sleep so a vicious circle there that's why I thought I'd my pre-tax return cos that was one of the things I started to worry about but I've got that new contract until the end of April so that's
B	good
A	where I'm planned up until
B	now I've decided I don't want my mum to put the patio cleaner on on Friday
A	okay
B	because well unless you help her move the furniture and whatnots
A	the patio furniture?
B	yeah
A	but I could do that but why don't we do it
B	you do more
A	on Sunday?
B	you do more inside things you said
A	I do more inside things
B	also you can't put it on if there's a threat of rain within the next two hours or so that's worth bearing in mind too
A	talking of which I put a wash out on the line darling where are all our
B	but I'd bring it in now then and put it over the
A	well
B	especially since
A	it was quite windy
B	fire lit
A	so but where are all our pegs?
B	I think they just get stolen
A	they've disappeared because
A	I had to
B	mm
A	double up on socks and towels and things so they won't dry as well as they could do
B	they won't dry at all
A	well there wasn't enough pegs darling
B	well we'll buy some more
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but I don't know what you've been doing
B	well they fall off and every time I collect garden waste they're in there's erm
A	some pegs
B	two or three pegs in with it
A	well we definitely need some more
B	did you know I fell to asleep before the end of Shetland last night?
A	er no I didn't know
B	yeah I did
A	okay well maybe
B	but I
A	was it the
B	I'd already discovered
A	just the end?
B	who did it
A	yeah well you don't really need to
B	no
A	watch we'll just start the new one
B	wow this bloke was eating in a pub in
A	what? he nicked his chip on his plate?
B	from his hand
A	wow oh is that true? or is it just
B	probably well probably one of the face
A	dissing a pub?
B	fake Fakebook updates
A	yeah
B	then you get in trouble
A	it's terrible if people do that
B	I think it's a squaddie town
A	I don't think that's true
B	I think
A	erm yeah
B	mm
A	I'm in the process of tidying out the
B	no no
A	office
B	Gmail first darling
A	yes just wait a little bit darling has he had supper?
B	no
A	mm
B	you had breakfast this morning though didn't you darling? did you wake me up? half past five on the dot good boy
A	ah
B	I always wait up
A	oh
B	wake up with such a start
A	yes
B	I think it's cos I'm in rapid eye movement at that time
A	what for us or have we got to pay her back?
B	we could mention it
A	well we do not have really any
B	mm?
A	sorry darling
B	what did you say?
A	I didn't say anything
B	what time did the delivery come?
A	I don't know
B	midday
A	just
B	one o'clock?
A	it would have been morning
B	what time did you get up?
A	twelve
B	ah
A	whoops
B	well he'll just find out as soon as he walks it won't he?
A	do you he might be worrying about it I suppose
B	now would you like to discuss options for our evening meal?
A	erm well there's chicken stock
B	frozen
A	oh er
B	did you freeze it?
A	no
B	so it's not frozen
A	so it's not frozen which makes that an option doesn't it?
B	erm
A	okay if you're not in the mood for risotto there's bad quality sausages
B	I'm not eating them
B	or try and foist foist them on
A	mm
B	is there any vegetables? are there any vegetables?
A	vegetables in the freezer and there's half a red pepper I think there's an onion
B	did those courgettes work?
A	yeah they're good
B	they looked quite soggy in the pan
A	a little bit wet but I think if you the trick would be to put very little oil in I think they would have been a bit dryer I think I just put too much oil it but they were nice done with the beans like that
B	look what about this for our porch?
A	mm don't know it's hard to tell is that horrid or nice? it's one of those on-the-line ones on the cusp of horrible or beautiful I want to see it
B	mm?
A	further away
B	that's weird
A	yeah
B	don't understand what that is now
A	well it's got a double covering thingy do-da whatsit
B	oh I see
A	I think not
A	oh that's a nice lampshade
A	that that one
B	mm sweet darling not for the library
B	the second from the second
A	well it's
B	really
A	but the snug is
B	with particular
A	Victorian
B	with an orange and or yellow motif
A	yes
B	mid-century furniture
A	yeah I'm quite
B	yeah
A	enjoying looking at these
B	no rush
A	maybe if we could just talk a little longer
B	what about a little pineapple?
A	yeah sort of one I was thinking of just a very simple little one
B	I like it
A	I like it
B	I like it now does it have a fitting though?
A	it's six quid yeah good question
B	mm it looks like it doesn't have anything
A	yeah so what do you do when it doesn't have anything?
B	it's just the bare
A	well you'd buy
B	depends
A	fix it to that
B	depends what size this aperture is
A	yeah it does doesn't it?
B	but otherwise you're right it would just be like a normal any old lampshade that you just put that between the who halves of the
A	yeah
B	lightbulb
A	well
B	holder
A	it's just the holder in the middle you'd need
B	but if that's an enormous
A	that nice yeah
B	then
A	then
B	I suppose I could fashion something
A	you'd have to fashion something
B	the right size
A	but fashion what and how?
B	now what size is it dear?
A	well it's the hole that's the the important question
B	it's seven inches tall
A	that's good
B	so sort of
A	that's alright although we want it quite low down cos it's a higher ceiling that porch
B	that is quite low I mean that's
A	yeah
B	the height it
A	exactly
B	the cable which you just
A	so but we can buy a nice cable that's what I'm thinking that sort of vintage cable
B	well what would a vintage cable look like? it's just a
A	I'll show you
B	it's just oh you mean like
A	well sort of brown and
B	you mean like a erm
A	nice looking
B	what's it called?
A	Bakelite
B	like a rope tile
A	er
B	a rope type effect
A	oh hold
B	mm
A	you won't let me have one like that will you?
B	mm it's wrong you could in the snug
A	it's not wrong yes okay the snug then that's quite a nice one that's the sort of thing I was thinking but again we've got the same problem
B	again it's got no thingy would you like to serve some crisps?
A	er
B	oh for goodness sakes what's that all about?
A	dunno
B	I always think that's a misuse of an apostrophe
A	yep it is a misuse of an apostrophe you're not supposed to have one there
B	it's very common
A	yeah
B	well you would do if it was specific to the year nineteen seventy
A	yeah yeah
B	a lot of them without the
A	that's nice
B	I think that hangs that way up
A	that's silly
B	oh okay
A	I don't like that one
B	sorry
A	it's alright
B	for in here I still want a nicer one in here
A	we should check your mum's offer first before she takes it down
B	yeah
A	and check it out oh that's got the whole thing look
A	don't know
B	look that's the kind of cable you mean isn't it?
A	mm it is
B	or is it a hole or is it just a weird reflection?
A	no would you be able to finish the bookshelves in the snug?
B	no cos I they need to be shaped along the edge
A	have you not got them shaped already?
B	I don't have a shaping tool
A	I don't suppose
B	oh hang on
B	no I think
A	before he goes could he?
B	cos
A	yeah
B	the long edge
A	well
B	we've got so little I don't want to cut it up and make mistakes and then we don't have any
A	well can can you get
B	no they are shaped
A	they are shaped? you said
B	but then the
A	they weren't shaped
B	the the long length it shaped then it would need further shaping once in situ
A	oh so then it's not shaped then
B	it's not fully shaped
A	well then we need to shape it
B	yes
A	could you get
B	what about that one?
A	before he goes?
B	buy it now twenty pounds
A	has it got a light fitting?
B	oh I quite like it
A	erm well because the thing is I want to work on the snug now
B	it's done
A	it's not done
B	yeah
A	we need a fireplace
B	oh
A	and we need a loveseat
B	a chaise longue?
A	no a loveseat
B	have you gone off a chaise longue?
A	yeah
B	I want a loveseat under that window
A	well
B	but it has to be
A	yeah
B	lower than the windowsill
A	yeah there's a really nice one on Made.com that would go there
B	yeah but measured that may not be lower than the windowsill
A	no it's a different one I'm thinking of
B	er? I'm going forward and we keep seeing the same things again
A	yeah it does that it's weird
B	like that revolting thing
A	mm
B	and that
A	er but you could put the light switches up
B	oh you've gotta leave them out
A	yeah
B	couple of questions I'll put them in the kitchen once it's decorated
A	I thought they were going downstairs in the hallway
B	yeah they are
A	but you just said you'd put them in the kitchen once it's decorated
B	well I think I got a bundle
A	you got two
B	no I got more than that
A	no you've only got two darling
B	well there's there's others somewhere else
A	well I don't know where
B	mm
A	mm
B	well do you want to put them out on the table at least? then I can then
A	yes I'll
B	then I can make the
A	forget though
B	the only complicated bit is earthing them
A	well er you need to ask
B	décor deco
A	oh it's alright actually but what is it?
B	I'm tired
A	is there anymore news at work?
B	mm
B	in these two particular departments and then mentioned that it won't impact
A	no
B	I mean he did make a point that actually it might very well increase our workload
A	oh right that's really pretty what's that one?
B	it's horrid
A	pretty
B	was that him?
A	I think so
B	have you not had a meal darling?
A	no call the RSPCA immediately
B	oh dear
A	air ambulance
B	mm Guide Dogs for the Blind
A	PDSA
B	Alcoholics Anonymous
B	Spinal Tap appreciation society
B	call the ministry of silly walks
A	yeah
B	I'm bored of looking at these now
A	oh but it would be lovely
B	I do yeah
A	we almost need a twin one
B	mm
A	very similar that's the look we want that was a lucky find
B	a brilliant find
A	what do you look under? what's your search term? light shades or light fittings? lampshade retro that's why you've got not the fittings because you've put lampshade cos you're just getting the lampshade
B	well mm
A	if you put light fitting you'll have the whole fitting darling
B	well you'd have a bit of both probably
A	well we've seen more shades than light fittings though
B	sorry
B	mm as a matter of urgency
B	oh sorry
A	what shall we do with your mum then?
B	well she's going to decorate the
A	she could do whatever she wants to
B	she's going to paint the dining room just with a whitewash for the moment
A	alright
B	cover up the yellow paint
A	oh good and she's
B	that that that will go on later yeah
A	yeah well it's gonna be much nicer than that yellow
B	yes
A	and then so that'll be it then won't it? that'll take up all her time
B	probably but we've got to move the display cabinet
A	oh
B	the middle of the room
A	yeah we do well I shall make a cup of tea I think
B	salt and vinegar
A	Chipsticks
B	crunchy sticks
A	Chipsticks why don't you sit there while I make my tea?
B	uhu
A	and then we can have a chat and also feed
B	do you want to do that?
A	yep
A	oh
A	meow
B	sure that's not a fish one?
A	don't know
B	okay
A	I know where some of the clothes pegs go cos I use them for keeping packets closed
B	oh yeah good point
A	but then I had to raid the
A	first weekend of what?
B	March
A	well I'll let them confirm first
B	I'm turning the fire down
A	oh
B	I'm not gonna look at lights anymore
A	oh I was enjoying that
B	it's boring
A	it's not it's interesting

A	no
B	have you sent?
A	I can't wait
B	what's that smell?
A	don't know
B	have you sent that link?
A	no
B	no well it's on Facebook
A	er well the other ones look very good
B	then don't tie them?
A	but they still still work okay
B	yes
A	don't they?
B	I might
A	you should keep
B	neighbour to come up
A	you should keep that
B	mm
A	four hundred
B	oh I never showed you that one in
A	mm show me that one
B	well I'll do it now
A	our dream home in
B	wow look at that fucking hell
A	yeah no that's not cos this'll go for five hundred
B	oh it's gone
A	that looks nice
B	yeah it's nice in the little end-of-terrace
A	oh maybe it's been sold
B	that's nice too
A	but then they usually still have them even if they're sold don't they?
B	if you search specifically
A	yeah
B	that's another one the er it's quite a sought after
A	is it?
B	mm
A	but still cheaper than
B	like for like yeah
A	but that's
A	two million
B	wow look at that staircase
B	I wonder if it's real
A	mm
B	yeah that looks like a chapel
A	that's where you can do your praying
B	mm mm no it's not there anymore
A	oh okay
B	just show you my one first
A	I thought that's what you were doing
B	well no that wasn't there so
A	oh
B	oh I've spelt it wrong
A	oh the one in Scotland is it Thurrock no? that's Essex
B	mm
B	yeah we could get this
A	wow
B	same amount of money look
A	wow
B	look at the view
A	oh my
B	there
A	good
B	that's from our lawn
A	fucking god
B	mm that's the Mull of
A	oh my
B	Kintyre there
A	god
B	original features look at that architraving
A	I mean if
B	oh
A	not long
B	that has to go
A	and we could erm
B	have to gut the kitchen
A	just buy it and not have a mortgage and I'll be the earner
B	wow look at the view from that bedroom
A	is there?
B	so you could get to that's the er that's your music studio
A	yeah it is
B	stroke office and that's the view
A	oh my god
B	and I suppose we could have croquet parties and whatnotties
A	why's it so cheap?
B	there's no work there
A	well there is if you've got internet
B	it's pretty mental isn't it?
A	mm
A	let's live there are there any shops?
B	we could drive there because you probably wouldn't come across a lot of other
A	well then if that if you can get that size then what's a smaller one?
B	well look at this
A	what?
B	the big house
A	where?
B	it's a joke dear
A	oh
B	it's what families do
A	yes but they'll believe you darling
B	no because they know that families do this
A	oh no darling I think your mum might take it seriously
B	and we pocket the profit I said
A	let's have a look at
A	what else is in that place then? we could just get a smaller one
B	that house? we'd pocket a nice tidier profit
A	that looks like a new one
B	it's actually not so nice and they get a lot of bungalows in the highlands
A	yeah
B	weirdly
A	I hate bungalows
B	about six bedroom
A	it looks like it doesn't it?
B	old Victorian schoolhouse
A	oh wow
B	don't show the garden
A	one hundred
B	no it's stained glass full length
A	no we could buy that
B	wow
A	without having a mortgage because we'd pay off our mortgage here and
B	yeah
A	we'd buy it with the change that is if you don't pay tax on the profit you make on a house I don't understand
B	that would be capital gains but
A	yeah but
B	I don't know the law
A	but it is capital gains isn't it?
B	we could afford this now just a holiday house
A	oh oh wow
B	look at the price
A	oh my god
B	tall ceilings as my mum would
A	well why don't we
B	go on about
A	just get that?
B	uhu
A	cos we could live anywhere so long as we've got internet
B	mm
A	that's amazing
B	I now want to check different bits of
A	mm what about that one? that a bungalow though? oh
B	look where that's
A	yeah
B	sited
B	I suppose they
A	mm
B	look at that view
A	oh wow
B	mm no they no good point
A	yeah cos that would be important if you're living there
B	mm
A	and one of us would have to learn to drive I think
B	yeah we'd have to there would be no way around that
A	probably wouldn't mind driving around there
B	look at that
A	mm nice
A	oh lovely
B	look at that carpet and wallpaper combo
A	mm
B	we've got to gut this place
A	oh that's a lovely garden oh it's got an outhouse
B	that's you
B	pop you in there
A	oh that's lovely is that near shops by any chance?
B	there's a distillery shall I show you where
A	no
B	what I won't show you?
A	no
B	why not?
A	cos it doesn't really mean a lot on a
B	spoil the magic?
A	map really
B	yeah but if you want to know like geographically what part of the world it is
B	look it looks like a sort of penis and scrotum
B	yes they certainly would
A	well then I'd probably like it
B	there you go look
A	mm very hard to get anywhere if we wanted to get anywhere
B	could fly into Glasgow very cheaply then you'd probably catch a train like I dunno down to
A	where you'd have
B	and then get a ferry across or like I said there's there is a little airport in
A	you'd have to fly er somewhere to go shopping
B	look here are the shops darling
A	what we should do is go on holiday there
B	hang on where are they?
B	I just saw some shops
A	I definitely saw a shop
B	they've disappeared
A	yeah
B	sorry
A	well that's weird cos I saw some shops
B	I can't now get back to the not
A	go back to map view
B	where's it say that?
A	at the top
B	there? oh yes
A	no
B	Longrow
A	look shop
B	so look we've got there's where we get our electrical goods
A	yes
B	confectionary and newspapers
A	is it a holiday destination?
B	not really
A	that looks quite
B	there's our bank Clydesdale Bank always Clydesdale on the west coast darling what's that little pretty red shop
A	yeah
B	I wonder? oh pub
A	turn that's it it's a hardware store
B	oh good that's very useful for me
A	where's the er where do we get our vegetables and groceries from?
B	corner shop
A	corner shop and it's called the corner shop
B	there's probably and out-of-town
A	go up go up there what's the treehouse? that looked nice it looks like a café doesn't it?
A	oh darling you would love that
B	I could actually maybe try and get a job in the distillery of course
A	yeah
B	Eagleson fresh sandwiches sandwich shop that's really annoying they just oh it's gone
A	mm
B	anyway I've made my point
A	anyway we can er we can buy that
B	no we got we started doing my one
A	usually find that we do what I want to do don't we?
B	indeed yes
A	and usually
B	look at this one darling
A	me and your mum gang up against you and then we do what we want you to do
B	wow do you want to live quite close to the sea?
A	oh my god
B	it's an old I think it's a number of old fishermen's cottages
A	oh but are you gonna get flooded there?
B	nah not by the sea that's rivers
A	or
A	or is the coast going to be eroded?
B	goes right down
A	I want to be by the sea
B	perhaps not a lot
A	there's only
B	to buy in Anstruther
B	Anstruther I can't pronounce that name that wouldn't help living there
A	well that is an amazing price compared to the other ones that George Street one's nice
B	want to make a start on supper my dear?
A	no
B	no
A	where's the search gone?
B	yeah
A	there we go I think it's on a road that we've walked down and I've already done street view for it and it's quite near to the well it's a short walk towards that place we had a meal
B	which side of town is it?
A	for the family with the family remember
B	that's right in the middle
A	where we had a meal?
B	yeah
A	it's well if you walk up the road that is at the end when you
B	what's
A	go into
B	yeah
A	anyway here it is and this is the one I want it's five nine nine
B	blimey
