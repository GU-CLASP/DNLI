A	so what have you packed so far?
B	erm I've packed haven't really packed any fun outfits I've got that white dress I haven't worn for absolutely ages
A	which one?
B	the one
A	like a
B	the one erm it's got a green belt and it's got little shift
A	shift dress
B	shiff chiffon like really floaty
A	oh okay
B	you like it
A	did I
B	do like it
A	you sure
B	yeah and then two maxi dresses more of like a day one and then an evening one
A	yeah
B	it's like I feel like I've got a dunno I was told I was I had loads of stuff to wear and I just don't know where it's all gone
A	I've got no holiday clothes as I say I'm not going to I've got no inclination to
B	well you're not the kind of person who wanders round all winter in shorts are you so it seems pointless
A	no
B	erm like it seems completely pointless buying spending loads of money on stuff particularly because oh I don't know I suppose this time of year it might be in the sales
A	no but the time of year as well is there anything to buy I can pretty much say I bought something say decent summer clothes I can pretty much say goodbye to them until next September
B	yeah like
A	next August so er I don't really see I just don't just see the point especially when I haven't got that much money as it is at the moment
B	yeah
A	is that washing machine going to get that loud
B	no it should be alright for a while
A	oh but erm
B	till it starts  yeah so I'm gonna go to Dorothy Perkins tomorrow and just buy you know those like strappy vest tops but they're like made of silk not actual silk
A	they're horrible
B	do you not like them
A	no
B	just plain strappy tops
A	just the worst
B	why are they the worst
A	cos they're really
B	completely inoffensive
A	they're really ill fitting
B	in what way?
A	just yeah just like remind me of like something when you buy cheap stuff it just doesn't wash well does it
B	no
A	finally
B	oh did that go in I thought
A	yeah thought you'd missed it
B	got I thought it went off thought it was the game
A	no scored
B	oh
A	it was it's basically the same ruse that they've tried three times and it's finally come off
B	just keep trying
A	if you'd missed if you'd missed again you could of just given up
B	oh yeah
A	got a good goal though
B	not bad query involved
A	yeah
B	sure it came off his foot
A	but that's been waiting to happen all night like just wanting to spring away just needed a better pass
B	yeah
A	that's a good goal
B	yeah
A	what we need erm but yeah I just I don't know I've got I've got a load of clothes I just don't wear a lot of them I buy them
B	yeah
A	things fall out of favour with me
B	yeah I'm the same I just forget so then I just wear what I wore last week cos it's
A	it's there
B	still fresh in my mind yeah
A	yeah  I just go through phases of having clothes I wear so it's like
B	like yeah
A	like I used to wear this cardigan all the time and I wear the same two t-shirts I bought those shirts I wear those shirts all the time and
B	yeah and it's like it's what on earth did I wear before I bought these shirts  wear these all the time
A	what did I think used to look alright
B	what did I used to wear
A	yeah but
B	yeah but I really want that black safari animal dress
A	it will be here knocking around somewhere
B	I know but I haven't seen it for a while I thought it might be in a basket but I went through you there and it's not
A	it might be in the pan cupboard with everything else
B	pan cupboard might well be
A	the shit cupboard erm
B	think cos did I have it did I wear it in the lakes
A	erm
B	I didn't did I
A	I don't know I can't remember
B	why don't you remember
A	I don't know
B	you're more attentive I don't think I did
A	no I don't think I did I think you would have been a bit much but you're tan off we'll look for it in the next four days
B	yeah
A	I'm in a pack I just don't I think I think the thing is that I know I'm going in five days I don't think it will be hard for me to pack that's why I'm relaxed
B	yeah I know it's just if you come across anything oh I really want to take that but it needs a washing
A	there's always all the washing will be done
B	there's still another two loads of washing to do
A	be fine get that done today and tomorrow
B	yeah if we do one each night it should dry in the say shouldn't it
A	yeah
B	I mean it's boiling in here
B	what like an actual dryer
A	yeah yeah like a Maiden like an actual dryer
B	you can get heated maidens
A	I think that would make it worse I think all that would do it make loads and loads of steam
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah it would your house would be really damp
A	yeah
B	it just I do I do like stuff that's been dried
A	I I've if I could have any luxury in my house I'd have a dry cleaner I I just
B	you mean just like a dryer tumble dryer
A	I'll say dryer I mean dry cleaners
B	somebody to come in to dry clean
A	and have a dry cleaners just in my wardrobe  no yeah sorry they get a
B	a tumble dryer
A	cos their parents have them and you don't have to iron anything
B	I know they are nice
A	everything comes out like warm and fresh
B	they just use to much electricity
A	mm
B	if we had one of those little Odometer things like how much electricity you're using
A	they were saying the other day I don't know what's up with them I don't know whether you said that the parameters of it and say you know this how much energy I
B	no no just tells you how much it uses
A	it keeps giving my parents warnings and telling them they're like killing Penguins
B	I don't know about that
A	I say we went one one morning we were in the house and I hadn't like I'm just going to shut that I hadn't like watched TV had a shower or anything and my mum and dad don't really use much energy by the time I got downstairs at ten in the morning my dad had had the grill on and it just cooks so it's going
B	maybe they had it set really low  don't put anything on
A	eco mode
B	like you have one light on the light on in one room for five minutes it's like electricity used
A	but their whole thing was like and I guess it is good cos it's people it's like probably didn't realise how much energy they were using cos you do forget
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's also interesting about like different things how
B	Doctor Mick
A	and I think it's Dermick
B	Dermick
A	Dermick his name
B	Dermot bought Swiss
A	yeah yes definitely
B	exactly like that
A	no erm but I think the idea is you know it keeps people sort of aware of what they're using it's like any sort of like alarm that you buy there's things you just do everyday and you don't think how much money you're spend here
B	yeah cos you just like fritter away
A	keep keep
B	get lunch on a card or petrol on the card
A	or people who keep like food diaries and you know it's only like those people
B	yeah
A	from channel four have got a pile of food on the table
B	in a tube
A	and you realise what you use and what you eat in a day
B	yeah
A	and I suppose it's a good thing for that but
B	cos I went through I had an app on my phone for a while and I put in exactly what I and I totted up how many calories
A	should be dead
B	cos I felt like what
A	laughs
B	what are you laughing
A	it's just laughs it how long did it take to fit it all in
B	how rude I don't eat loads
A	you constantly snack
B	no I don't actually I do  don't
A	you do
B	I don't I could tell you I've eaten look breakfast had breakfast at home I had lunch at lunchtime I had two chocolate fingers in the afternoon and then I had nothing for tea and then I've just had pudding that's a perfectly rationable rational amount of food
A	that is a very rational amount of food
B	but erm yeah like I was trying to just to see you know that secret eater programme particularly in my last job cos we had a box
A	yeah biscuits
B	we had a box full of food and in just in the office when like whenever it was starting to get low someone would bring in a box of maltesers and biscuits and it was just constantly
A	oh my word
B	always in the office and any time you went to go to the loo or to do the door or to the filing cabinet you had to pass this magical box of food so of course you just
A	and if you didn't have to you found a way to pass it
B	exactly and then when you're sat there bored like if your bored in work the only thing you can do that's enjoyable is either make a couple of tea go to the toilet or eat something
A	erm I enjoy going to I enjoy going to the bathroom cos I know I'll be left alone
B	yeah I know I found myself just sitting in there for a little while
A	that's what I do as well
B	it's quiet nobody can bother me
A	sounds weird I just like I just lie to chill cos I just know that if I'm in the hall I'll get stopped by someone
B	yeah but I suppose my job's the opposite trying to find things to do look I'll go to the toilet drag that out for as long as you possibly can
A	our bathroom's dead small
B	mm
A	but no the thing is like I wouldn't eat like you know I don't snack and I don't really eat like loads but like
B	that's insane
A	like chocolate
B	like who makes fudge at home
A	fudge American people do
B	nice yeah
A	cos Americans  do know how to enjoy their food English people would be like I couldn't possibly make fudge at home
B	I wouldn't know where to start making fudge
A	and she makes stuff like cinnamon toast for breakfast that you fry it's like
B	fried bread
A	fried bread in sugar and cinnamon
B	yeah
A	it's beautiful it is nice I had it
B	oh yeah I'm sure it is
A	she made it for me once but I think it's the attitude it's like if you're gonna make something indulge make it indulgent don't like
B	well you have to do it half half
A	yeah don't you know sort of like feel guilty for having a dessert it's going to be a dessert
B	might as well enjoy it
A	but yeah so she brought in this big tub of fudge and I would never think to myself if I was I sitting there on my own I'd never think got I really fancy some fudge now but she put it the minute the it's also the anonymity thing
B	yeah
A	like in the staffroom in our staffroom
B	did she have a little label on it saying eat me
A	yeah but it's not about it's not anonymous in our office cos there's only she and I who you know if someone's eaten two thirds of the fudge it's one of us erm so like but and she you know I just sat there with it it must have been there like one afternoon for an extra hour or so so I just put erm that's a penalty and erm so like I just sat there and like I didn't really think about it I was filling in paper work bite of fudge fill in paper work bite of fudge and next thing I know I've eaten like a good chunk of this tub
B	this is it is that like mindless eating isn't it
A	yeah
B	that's why I got that app
A	I'll just have one more I'll just have one
B	yeah
A	I'll just have one more
B	that's why I got that app cos I thought how much do I actually eat am I consuming more calories than I'm actually using cos I and especially it's like a desk job I'm just sat at a computer when I was on the Dowie I was moving around you know playing with the kids
A	yeah
B	you're up you hardly ever sitting down
A	no
B	so then you think I can have that slide of cake in the kitchen cos I'm on my feet moving around all day but when you sat at a computer it's actually like you really need many calories so I just
A	yeah
B	out of interest wanted to check and see that I thought
A	oh what a strike that was he's amazing that fella yo seen this one before
B	no it's a bit
A	he's had two wonder strikes that is
B	wonder strike
A	they slow down and  the music plays
B	muse
A	laughs what's that song called
B	sings
A	sings like a something
B	song bird
A	no
B	showbiz
A	no that goes  no
B	it's an early album
B	ah yes
A	am I right
B	you're right ah claps
A	doctor Mick laughs
B	good effort doctor Mick
A	top defending there by who is that
B	dunno
A	oh it's Gary Cahill what was it look at the pace of Gary Cahill there jeez what is it about food
B	erm so yeah then I like foolishly thought that the amount of calories for a female per day was actually two thousand five hundred and not two thousand so I thought  right I'll see if I can eat one and I'll just cut it down a little bit so I can like
A	yeah
B	just lose a little bit for weight like one thousand two hundred calories cos I was thinking that's nearly three hundred calories less
A	yeah
B	than normal that shouldn't effect me too bad started to feel really ill and really lie tired and then realised that actually the average is amount is two thousand calories so I was
A	what's for men
B	eight hundred less two thousand five hundred
A	but do you not feel like I don't know I always feel like you know sort of these kind of it's like five a day and units of alcohol and this amount of units per day and this is what you should be eating who comes up with these things I know it's like food
B	dieticians
A	dieticians and nutritionists and all that shit but it's humans aren't like one size fits all sort of thing it's not like
B	well no but they've done
A	er
B	they do studies don't they? and to find like
A	okay
B	in general people who eat five portions of fruit and veg a day
A	mm
B	live longer now they're saying like seven aren't they? but
A	but but that logic is nonsense er because it it er doesn't take how much how much time these people spend in cars do these people smoke?
B	yeah
A	how much alcohol do they drink?
B	no exactly
A	but what what it's basically saying is if we lived on a diet of fresh fruit and no one ate anything no one did anything apart from sit in a room and eat fresh fruit
A	then people who eat more fresh fruit would
B	no
A	live longer than the people who didn't eat fresh fruit and even then there'd be congenital variables in it
B	exactly
A	it's nonsense
B	yeah yeah but that's the recommended daily amount
A	yeah and er and er I I get it like er I get the idea of like you know people like to see like little building blocks and like to say oh I've had my five a day today
B	yeah
A	but
B	I mean when you think of that in terms of like a campaign that is
B	well no okay people don't follow it but they're you know it's it's a really well recognised thing isn't it?
A	yeah
B	and that's through a campaign
A	that little logo on the
B	yeah
A	I swear it's on the side of a bottle of Appletiser
B	well you know that erm gluten free cake I made last week?
A	yeah
B	I was like two of your five a day in that cake and they were like what? and I was like mashed potato
B	and lemon
B	forget about the sugar
A	is it veg as well?
B	no well potatoes don't count and I don't know why something to do with the starch content
A	wait no so no but veg counts for like?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	I I
A	do I
B	so what have you had? what did you have for breakfast? chocolate cereal
A	what's it called?
B	so that probably doesn't
A	I mean I I was biting into it yesterday and like er er today and like the the chocolate in it is so bad it's like you know when you get like
A	you know you get you know you get like an Easter egg off like an aunt?
A	that's like just really
B	that doesn't like you
A	crap quality
A	you know the type that
B	or those really cheap erm advent calendars
A	yeah
A	from them
A	I've only got a bit left of that
B	oh
A	it's not it's not
B	I only bought that the other day
A	and it's only two bowls worth in it it's a thin box like
B	yeah it is
A	it's only like
B	it is a tiny box
A	it's only like two hundred
B	have to mix it with something have to mix it with your Special K
A	just
B	make it healthy
A	ground up digestives
A	doughnuts
A	but I dunno I
B	yeah so then and then what did you have for your lunch?
A	today?
B	yeah
A	er I came in and had noodles but I
A	I wonder if they're like fatty or not?
B	noodles? there's probably a lot of salt in them
A	well no cos it's just the flavouring isn't it?
B	mm
A	that's what the salt is that that's all that
B	yeah
A	it's like salt it's like
A	it's
A	that you're putting on it
B	yeah erm yeah and then what's the other? the only thing you've had today is your is peas isn't it?
A	erm yeah no but I just I just think like
B	you didn't eat the
A	I
B	it's just something to aim for I suppose isn't it?
A	huh
B	and the other thing is you either do or you don't
A	but but why er but it's so but it's so arbitrary like why focus on like? you know er you know so it's like it's like measure of alcohol like you know units units per week like you know people should not exceed X amount of alcohol per week and things like that and it's like but why focus on these things? what about you know next thing it'll be like you know don't have er you know remember like the salt content thing for a while? do you remember that? and it was like had that
A	don't eat more than a bit of salt
B	that's a really good impression
A	I was the voice of Penny Crayon
A	was she the voice of Penny Crayon?
B	who's Penny Crayon?
A	Penny Crayon the girl who drew things and they came to life
B	not that thing off ZZZap?
A	don't er don't they don't no not ZZZap don't you remember Penny Crayon?
B	no
A	erm you you'll remember it was a great
B	I
A	the fifth option on Google
A	that's pretty good Penny Crayon
B	crayon outfit
A	look at the
B	oh
A	I'm gonna be so made up if it was like the voice by Jenny Eclair oh Su Pollard
B	Su Pollard
A	that's and that is it Jenny
B	who's Su Pollard?
A	it it's wait she she's like she looks a bit like Jenny Eclair no she don't at all that's terrifying
B	oh did that bounce in?
A	that hit the bar?
A	has that guy hit the bar again? what a player
B	yeah he did it bounced
A	what a player is he?
B	you know like Frank Lampard one?
B	that's onside
A	has he struck that again?
B	oh no was it offside? I think er maybe it was offside
A	what a player he is he is what's his name?
B	player
A	is that that Drmić?
B	yeah no no it's not
A	he's probably someone really good
B	what's happened there?
A	he's er he's er he's just lashed out at someone there cos he's
B	nah he doesn't look annoyed
A	erm yeah Penny Crayon so she drew things and they came to life but anyway I think it was Jenny Eclair who was on the adverts and she was like it was the you know it was warning people about their salt
B	yeah they're like fat-free stuff isn't you know it's
A	because er there was er there was a
B	well it's anything artificial isn't it? you know? a little bit of
A	I told you about that thing though about about sugar and how it makes you hungry?
A	like er you like when
B	yeah it
A	so Jerome's been sent off
B	no
A	come on Jags
B	ah look at him he's got good skin hasn't he?
A	it's cos he's an Evertonian all of us we all have good skin
A	we er we all
B	you do have good skin you do you do have good skin
A	you get when you get your tickets you get like Olay trying to think of an Everton player that doesn't have good skin
B	where's Gareth Barry?
A	Gareth Barry?
B	is he not playing today?
A	I think he he's might of huh he might still be in the England squad
B	he hurt himself
A	but er no he's not he's not he's er he's not injured it's just like
B	they're just playing a load of randomers aren't they tonight?
A	no not at all this is like a strong squad
B	oh it's him there Stefanović
A	Stefanović
B	oh Swiss cheese I get it
A	but yeah I dunno I just think that like you know er then then it would be huh they they
B	yeah you're just like
A	you know agreed agreed nanny state diet that we all need to sort of?
B	you just go into Asda and you pick up your five meals that you have been created for you to eat
A	here's your mulch
B	thanks and then you go home and you reconstitute it
A	it's I know it's a bit extreme like
B	like astronaut food
B	yeah
B	I suppose it's make it's it's
A	why why not say like and
B	oh is okay
A	it's not that it's okay I mean it's obviously
B	you can recover from it
A	it's not as good as not
B	yeah
A	than smoking like late er late in your thirties and you know but huh at the moment they why why is it why does it say anything? why do we regulate and say anything? and say okay well like or why do we have these initiatives like don't eat so much of this don't eat do so much of this? but then other things that should be sort of curbed I suppose there's just a blanket ban on cigarettes isn't there? it's er it's a blanket no no
B	mm
A	but then
B	too much er of a grey area isn't it? and I suppose they're addictive
A	no it's not it's
B	they're addictive as well I suppose that's the thing isn't it? so the but er I don't know like sugar's probably more addictive than cigarettes but erm they they do deserve a goal I think Switzerland
A	Switzerland have been brilliant
B	erm
A	it's er it's not it's not that it's a grey area I mean the I think the facts are there it's the fact that like there's just been so much misinformation spread over the years
B	yeah
A	and it's just even now
B	but yeah I think it er it's because it's addictive isn't it?
A	mm
B	so they can say oh yeah smoke in you twenties that's fine it's like that would be fine if people then stopped but then by that point a lot of people are addicted and then it's more difficult for them
A	yeah it's too hard to it's too hard to give up
B	to stop so they carry on then and then they start to do damage
A	it's
B	so it's easier to say no don't start isn't it?
A	it's interesting to see cigarette stuff do you remember the scare stories when it was like
B	yeah there's things there calling for bans on them
A	yeah but who's calling for bans on them?
B	I don't know but it's like somebody set fire to themselves
A	yeah one person
B	yeah cos they add oxygen in
A	I wonder how many forest fires have been started by cigarettes
B	oh yeah too many yeah oh
A	oh yeah wasn't it some fella
B	he was on an oxygen machine
A	yeah and what happened to it oh the
B	he set fire to the oxygen
A	a cigarette wouldn't of done that if you light a cigarette
B	if he'd lit cigarette yeah but there's no natural naked flame is there on a cigarette
A	on a lighter there is
B	if you lit  a cigarette like that
A	yeah sure he was doing it with his mind it would of had the same effect can't really
B	the clear he might as well of carried on smoking cigarettes cos he  was already on oxygen so switching to an e-cigarette then seems a bit pointless really doesn't it the damage had
A	surely that's a penalty
B	already been done
A	that a penally
B	who's that
A	Fabien Delph
B	who's he?
A	I think he plays for Aston Villa he always does he round on our fantasy league but I never really like the look of him
B	not sure if they're looking
A	I think he's a good player but erm you know I just always wonder if you see these stories about oh e-cigarettes are dangerous sorry they're just never going to be as dangerous as
B	no they're not it's people like your mum and dad
A	yeah
B	and I think they would of gone back to smoking had it not been for e-cigarettes and you just think oh yeah alright completely replace them that's fine it can't be more harmful you know it probably would be better to give up altogether but you know if you had the choice between the two I know which one I would rather people did
A	mm
B	it's got to be better isn't it
A	Roy Hodgson needs to calm down he looks like he looks sick with anger so yeah so
B	cos he probably gets sacked if they don't win
A	well he would of got sacked after the world cup if they don't qualify or get out of the group stage for the euros he'll get sacked after I'm worried about the euros more than the world cup
B	there's not going to be much expectations
A	yeah but that was that was disastrous
B	oh did he knee him in the back is that what happened there
A	I watched
B	he kneed him in the back
A	the euros I watched one game with
B	they just bombed out they just completely crashed out
A	why did they watch the first game
B	did they even qualify I thought they didn't qualify for the last euros
A	the first game no
B	they didn't qualify
A	no they didn't oh the last euros you're talking about
B	yeah
A	no I'm talking about the world cup
B	oh
A	so I watched
B	where were you for that Brazil game cos I was here on my own you were at a gig
A	yeah
B	you'd gone to that
A	no we'd gone to see slow cut
B	yeah was that in the black something in Chinatown
A	the blackie no it was erm that was in no I'd gone to see sixty days of static that night
B	yeah that was the night of Brazil wasn't it
A	what when they did well? with all their histrionics and
B	Germany beat them seven one
A	no that was slow cut tat night
B	was it
A	definitely cos I was watching it for a bit
B	you weren't here
A	nope
B	oh yeah
A	no so I watched so I'm trying to think I know we watched games with my friends I definitely watched one with
B	do you really remember watching
A	I was really drunk for that game I can't remember now
B	I can't remember either I was in Leeds for so you must have been in Manchester
A	yeah
B	doesn't really matter does it
A	I think
B	yeah
A	I cant afford especially if we're going for two nights oh Switzerland just spend their time practising shooting
B	yeah
A	they're well amazing at shooting erm

B	doesn't
A	yeah he pays his bit of the rent it's a really oh my god it's such a nice house
B	is it a house
A	yeah no well is it no it's a ground floor flat but it kind of feels like a house it's quite big
B	yeah
A	it just feels like the downstairs of a house it's really nice but erm

B	is
A	they're expecting
B	every time I see
A	go on Wayne erm yeah
B	I know I just don't think either of them have much experience in buying houses not that I have particularly but it just takes ages like when your estate agent says to you oh yes it will be eight to ten weeks you can double that in an instant
A	yeah exactly I don't think their dead certain it's going to be that weekend

B	work
A	yeah just nothing interesting really
B	work is
A	I know that's really good is but that's not really until the end of October I'm looking forward to going to Oxford and
B	and Manchester
A	yeah that'll be fun
B	family tandu
A	tandu that's
B	a manly hen do
A	a manly head do
B	stag do
A	yeah  that'll be good like I hope
B	oh right okay
A	not that far from
B	no not really you paid that far in a tax you might as well go to Spital
A	I paid a taxi from there once it was thirty quid
B	get like a mini bus couldn't you
A	fell asleep on the train and woke up in the station
B	was that you did that a few times didn't you
A	yeah but that wasn't in the morning it was late and I'd got a ell asleep I actually I'd gone back and forth erm yeah
B	that's bad
A	I'd hit my head that night that's why I was so weird
B	yeah
A	think it was the air well it was the air
B	a bit
A	a bit of both but erm yeah it's not awful it's just down the motorway and it sounds daft but it's like
B	yeah I suppose maybe
A	I don't quite understand the logistics of it if it's not a hackney but I mean cos it was a hackney
B	oh
A	I just walked outside the station and that was more can you take us to Spital and the guy was like get in but we just shot down the motorway so it didn't seem that long whereas if you kind of
B	it's not like it doesn't take us that long to get from my dads
A	but it is distance it's not time is it or is it time
B	erm I think it is distance
A	or is it a bit of both cos sometimes it goes up again
B	it is yeah if you're in a traffic jam yeah I don't know dunno
A	yeah I was just I
B	yeah
A	I could see why wants it in Chester just to make it a bit different it's
B	it'll be nice to get to that church
A	why does everyone tell me Chester's really rough at night
B	yeah dunno probably is
A	how I don't understand how rough is it
B	just fights no rougher than
A	but I still don't understand what that means it's rough at night
B	well it's like
A	is it like the warriors the seventies gang film people
B	games like hunger games
A	hunger games
B	just tribes come out
A	I have this image of and it's nothing but a scene from
B	yeah
A	and I didn't see it  nor would that indicate any kind of violence it could have been a cyclists
B	yeah
A	anything
B	a chain
A	a daisy chain
B	yeah
A	but yeah she as just I saw a man swinging a chain so I didn't I just I don't  one of those things that's like everyone say how rough Chester is
B	yeah I dunno it's just one of those things
A	is it like when people say anywhere well they're not from is bad?
B	well yeah cos if you weren't used to going out in Liverpool you'd think it was terrible
A	yeah
B	I think we just gotta be vigilant
A	yeah think so
A	don't walk around on your own
B	yeah definitely go to you could go to the botanists there and you could there
A	not really a stag do kind of place
B	you could go to the church
A	these are all terrible places to go on a stag do
B	not been there with me the church the church is converted into a bar its really nice inside have you not been that's really nice you should go there
A	it's with your other man
B	I went with dad an
A	maybe I have been
B	you'd remember it cos it is a church that's now got a bar in  the middle of it it still looks like a church it's got a bar in the middle of it
A	yeah  it still is a church it's just got a bar in it
B	yeah must have been there
A	dead awkward on Sundays during mass yeah no erm John will know what he's doing with it
B	yeah or his brother
A	well it's I think this will be his brothers kind of thing
B	yeah should be I feel like I need to get  back on it with the hen do
A	with
B	yeah
A	why you've pretty much done everything a year in advance
B	not really I've bought we've booked a place I haven't decided I need to start lie telling them what I wanted to do was allow people to pay in instalments so instead of in February saying I need a hundred quid from everybody cos everyone's always skint after Christmas saying can I have a bit of money before
A	yeah
B	and a bit of money after
A	yeah
B	spread the cost  little bit
A	makes sense
B	but I need to decide  what activities we're gonna do so that I can add a bit of that into the cost
A	I think it's sensible to not  to try and get all that money off people at once cos are you going to have to sort this yourself?
B	yeah I'm going to have to chase the money
A	well don't book it until you get money off people
B	yeah
A	I know that sounds stupid but otherwise people take advantage like people still haven't paid
B	yeah
A	you know
B	I've paid it so I don't feel bad about that now
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	pretty sure that soon enough
B	when is it Easter April? you find a yeah
A	yeah well don't think
B	dunno what she's thinking of doing
A	give em some time only had two days
B	well she says
A	I need to I found some like calmish style tablets before that I might take when we go on the plane
B	yeah why not calms bless you
A	they're the same stuff the same gumph it's like
B	where'd you get it from
A	I cleaned out the pen drawers
B	how much are they
A	where there's still a bit of stuff in there to sort like my iPod's in there all the pens are in there
B	yeah I noticed it I thought you meant you'd see it in a shop
A	no I found it I found
B	yeah aren't they
A	I don't know
B	it's worth it if it just brings your anxiety down  bit or just get you drunk before you get on the plane
A	that's  worse though cos you'll sober up though sorry if you're on an hour long flight it's like three hours and twenty and you've got like a hangover
B	yeah true and then you gotta pay five pounds for a bottle of water on Thompson
A	is that the company
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah they might be slightly better than easy jet I think
A	so is your dad enthused about the old
B	lounge I don't think so I sent a message saying enjoy the VIP lounge and he sent me a message back saying I'm just enjoying a coffee and I was like only a coffee and he was like yeah I went and asked about the food what does the food look like and all I can see if soup and croissants at the moment
A	just sounds like the kissing gate
B	I'd rather the kissing gate loves the kissing gate it's my favourite place
A	you love it
B	yeah I love it pint of Peroni and a mini fish and chip basket by the window watching the planes it's my favourite place to be
A	best forty quid I've ever spent
B	not even that expensive
A	it is
B	it's not it's like six pounds for mini fish and chips and a pint it's not that bad
A	last time we went through there is that with you?
B	Poland maybe
A	no last time we went was when we went to Paramafera
B	oh yeah
A	but erm
B	well I shall be oh Ill probably won't be cos it's like six in the morning we fly to go to Spain
A	is it you get a nice breakfast
B	mm I don't know why they bother with that magazine any more it's just so rubbish
A	I read it today it's really good
B	it's just boring
A	there was a book there's one about these people who free dive but cos they're so oxygen deprived they have hallucinations
B	mm
A	and then they've made
B	hallucinations
A	a short film about erm it was kind of weird half real half not thing about free dive about hallucinating in complete pitch blackness it was good magazine
B	its not bad but it's like a fiver a go
A	you always be a member of it
B	you don't have to be
A	society of psychologists or whatever it is the league of psychologists
B	the league
A	the league of extraordinary psychologists erm
B	still not decided on what books to take I don't know what I'm going to feel lie and that's the issue
A	I know I don't really want to take any of my depressing books
B	I know cos I was going to take a psychology book like compassionate mind and then I was like do I really want to read about psychology or do I just want a break from it so I don't know I think I'll just get bored of it and then it's like that it'll have to be an epidemic I don't want to read that I just want to read a Richard and Judy trash book
A	which one you say you going to get Gone Girl
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean I don't really want to take I do I know which book I want to a buy a novel
B	yeah
A	to take with me but I want a decent one and the book and I want the one I was telling you about the other day it's a hard back ain't paying fifteen quid for a massive book
B	no it's just gonna be a pain to read
A	and fifteen pound pretty pricey
B	uh huh
A	erm
B	what was that secret history or
A	oh it's brilliant
B	is it good? would I like it
A	erm yeah I don't know how anyone couldn't like it really
B	yeah did you finish it?
A	no but people told me
B	oh no
A	well no I kind of I knew it's not the ending is the point it's the way it's written it's set in the weird ivy league culture and it's about sort of it's it's this very I was talking about
B	did you see robin's post about the Latin on his curtain s being wrong?
A	weirdly no not with that stuff
B	I don't know why it came up on mind but it was like you know in robin's way there's this spelling mistake on my Latin curtains so you know yo can get those curtains with weird Latin scrawl on them
A	no I've never seen them
B	you never seen them they're quite old fashioned you normally get them in a dusty maroon with like gold writing on them but the gold's like dusty and not that obvious
A	yeah
B	spelling mistake a typo or they've spelt the Latin wrong or something
A	gosh send them back yeah
B	it was like it must be really annoying if you know that
A	he'll be desolate he'll be ready for work now
B	yeah but
A	but he probably tarting again soon
B	yeah
A	properly
B	its exciting
B	yeah
A	he said he's gonna go most weekends you know
B	how much is he
A	again you know don't waste your money you can do these things it's when you're an idiot
B	go to Germany
A	you're an idiot like me
B	you're not an idiot
A	I am
B	why are you an idiot
A	I just fritter money relative I don't mean loads I have no doubt that he's saved
B	yeah
A	he's a sensible guy cos he was saying to me the only problem is when they have the faculty meetings cos if it's on a Friday so it's not going look great to be starting off sorry I need to go off to my partner erm so yeah so he's gonna try and visit her as much
B	that will ne nice
A	he's got a
B	yeah make the most of it
A	it's his wide dammit erm
B	doo doo
A	I wonder hat the German will say about that tomorrow
B	oh who knows
A	cos it wasn't like a majestic performance but it was
B	pretty decent
A	yeah erm yeah he said I think well when I got down to when we go down to visit
B	so
B	you can ask him if he's he might make an exception that weekend if you're up

A	I always look forward to Christmas
B	yeah  don't you think that tall thin tree would look good there
A	what is your problem with that space why do you hate it so much
B	why do I need to fill it it's just thinking it's the only place I can think of to put a tree unless yo put it there and then it's in front of the books
A	erm
B	that just seems an obvious place to put a tree
A	yeah that'd be alright yeah I'd be happy at Christmas as well maybe cos I've got work I get I get no sympathy from anyone whenever it's like hard we get zero holiday but we get Christmas off I think people who haven't had Christmas off idealise it in a way which it's like gosh what I'd do with all of Christmas off
B	no I just think it's just jealousy people like it's I think having had it for three years this will be the fourth Christmas it's like nice but rather an even want it
A	well no yeah no really it's you can't possibly judge it fairly cos as soon as it come around you're like thank god I'm so glad I don't have leave the rest of the year
B	but then in the middle of the year
A	yeah your begging for it and you're knackered
B	yeah
A	erm but yeah so it's like I don't know I never do anything with it what can you do everyone's either with their family or you know I

A	who does
B	your sister
A	anyone's
B	yeah that's what she said forty
A	my mum just
B	makes stuff up
A	decides what the nicest possible eventuality is and then just talk as if it's fact  or like you could have a mum like really bad news and then just say but I saw a kitten and you guarantee then next thing she asks you was about the kitten she doesn't she just the brain just day dreams
B	oh
A	and then it means that she can then tell people that and say ah
B	kind of glad we're away next week for it
A	it's the Scottish thing
B	it's just going to roll now isn't it this is it for another ten days
A	nine days that is

A	when was the last time you
B	had some American girl on the radio being like oh my god my friends are gonna be so jealous that I was here when the news broke

B	or free pie if you're called
A	yeah that would be good
B	that's what it was when he was born prime minster doing free pie if you're called
