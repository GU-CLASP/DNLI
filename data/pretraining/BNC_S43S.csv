A	look darling that's never been anywhere near a dishwasher
B	I know
A	in its life
B	it's erm
A	I mean that could have come
B	I don't
A	straight out of the showroom
B	I don't get why we've got such a bargain
A	it's good
B	I mean was that genuinely someone trying to get rid of them?
A	mm
B	and the amount of wrapping it took
B	was amazing
A	I think those giant cups are funny
B	but each cup was individually wrapped in newspaper and bubble-wrapped and
A	mm
B	so it must have taken ages for someone
A	these have never been
B	to send it
A	I don't think these have ever been
B	no
A	used cos
B	but I don't even want to put them in the dishwasher really
A	or even make tea in them
A	hello darling
B	but I think we should use them oh we should just use them like the other ones except not put these ones in the dishwasher maybe
A	well I don't mind you putting them in the dishwasher to the honest I like the giant teacups
B	except they'll get spoilt in the dishwasher
A	oh that's got a slight fault hasn't it?
B	and they erm tend to weaken after they've been in the dishwasher I think
A	yeah that's why they feel heavier
B	these ones particularly fade
A	mm
B	if you look at our plates you'll see what happens
A	what have you baked darling
B	erm that's buckwheat
A	oh
B	yeah but I think it needs
A	what recipe?
B	to be toasted it'll be best toasted
A	oh that's
B	yeah it is very
A	is it a hundred percent buckwheat?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	yeah
B	it's not like bread you have to
A	smells really nutty
B	it's erm
A	I wouldn't go anywhere near that if I was
B	oh hold on let me check
A	it's alright all their products say they contain nuts
B	allergy advice may contain gluten
A	they all say yeah
B	shit
A	no in in
B	they're saying peanuts though
A	yeah but anything you buy from the that shop it's annoying
B	is it? well that's why I think toasted would be better
A	mm
B	it's a bit of an
A	he can go anywhere he wants
B	what are you doing up here? want to look out the window? have you seen our new cups? look mm there you go oh he's quite comfortable
A	did you put erm no he's beginning to think about
A	struggling
B	would you like Quorn?
A	I thought you put that in it?
B	not yet
A	oh I thought I saw it
B	no
A	yeah but
B	oh you're so cuddly

A	to work
B	that day? that
A	to work not just
B	oh right
A	to the leaving do
B	yeah
A	just didn't even bother turning up to work that's just scandalous
B	why why is that that scandalous though?
A	well cos you expect a little bit of respect among fellow
B	oh
A	human beings
B	mm
A	erm
B	it's her style though isn't it?
A	well
B	no
A	in the financial and a couple of young girls that we work with erm and there were two people there so that was the erm
B	right that's it? two people?
A	and that was it
B	oh dear
A	and then the other one of the chaps left
A	two minutes
B	left
A	two minutes later so it was just
B	well the morale was at a record low so
A	and then
B	I mean it couldn't get any lower so
A	yeah but oh I thought you meant the chicken
B	oh that's the wrong one oh fucking hell
A	so that was two people from that department and that was just some of them but then
B	so actually hardly anyone from the department then?
A	two three people in all
B	funny
A	it was alright
B	but you're eating it like you like it
A	well bit too nutty for me really but
B	really?

A	maybe I'll get changed into
B	yeah get changed
A	oh
B	I did all the washing
B	I done it all
A	still learning
B	did you think my buckwheat bread will be okay toasted?
A	well
B	I mean it's not as tasty and yummy and moreish as a normal wheat
A	darling we simply don't know
B	like bread
A	cos we've never experienced er
A	I mean I reckon it'll be like it'll take
B	yeah
A	but I think it will taste good
B	it's quite moist
A	what
B	good alternative
A	oh yes
B	if we don't want
A	it's good for me
B	lots of wheat
A	well it's good for me because
B	if you want to be er a bit wheat-free
A	I don't think wheat is good for my little tum tums is it?
B	it's not no it's not I don't think what is good anyway
A	but unfortunately everything you buy from Holland and Barratt
B	per se
A	oh
B	oh yes
A	I don't have the jumper any more because I spilt kidney
A	yes

B	things need to be taken out of the machine and
A	well you didn't know what going on
B	put on the line before we do anything
A	you didn't know if you were coming or going because it isn't part of your responsibilities
B	no I actually quite like it as part of my responsibilities
A	I think I'll put this jumper on I don't need that jumper darling
B	it's strangely therapeutic
A	oh good
B	getting on top of the washing
A	I'm desperate for a wee-wee then we'll liaise some more are you still recording me?

A	when?
B	and it's a good one when we were in the

B	the
A	no darling the one in the whole square if we go to

B	is that St Mark's I wonder
A	that's the
B	mm yeah oh that'll be quite interesting to see that
A	which is why we're all here I suppose
B	what in the parish of
A	the church the church arrived and then
A	all us worshipers
B	and Bob's your uncle
A	I almost ended up going to

A	and then
A	er but then he had to hurry because
A	but no she has to get up at seven AM
B	yeah well that doesn't really stop her
A	and he didn't say why erm so so he
B	yeah
A	and then I thought oh shall I just
A	go with him?
B	yeah that close
A	cos I'd had enough beers to think it might be a good idea and then didn't
B	and you wouldn't have come home if you had
A	but then the second temptation was cos I got to rapidly got to
B	oh yeah
A	and then thought oh
B	easy get off
A	I could walk from here and maybe even beat
B	yeah
A	and that would be even that would be quite funny
B	yes
A	but I I resisted
B	and then you'd be like hi
A	yeah
A	but I resisted that too
B	it is a bit of a temptation and you would have spent I mean
A	well absolutely
B	about a hundred pounds
A	the other factor is that
B	er because
A	it was
B	and especially if you were there
A	well as
B	yeah she would have er
B	buy it then can't he?
A	and of
B	yes
A	er sorry not
