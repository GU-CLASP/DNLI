B	it's a
A	I know
A	in the library I get very self-conscious
A	I don't know why it is

B	yeah
B	it's in the safe upstairs

A	yeah
B	right let's get cracking away
A	er we need your passport
A	yeah
B	you can?
A	well I dunno actually
B	postal order?
A	yeah I've seen a few erm that like say postal order
B	what the hell I one of them? dunno
A	I don't I don't really know
B	I think you have to go to a post office and say
A	I wanna pay
B	I wanna
B	for this much
A	a financial instrument intended for sending money through the mail
B	oh right
A	and paid at another post office or a small fee for the service known as poundage
A	is paid by us
B	oh
B	are we gonna do our own passport photos?
A	no
B	printed ones
A	need what?
B	gonna need a lot
A	yeah
B	either for your driving permits or your visas
A	okay yeah well we could go to get them done today if we nip out
B	well then it's ten quid
A	well I mean like well how are you gonna print it?
B	printer
A	don't you like have to have special good quality paper?
B	yeah glossy paper I suppose
A	er I'm just just thinking
B	we'll just we'll just print them we'll just
A	oh and we can we can take a picture of it and then just go to the
B	yeah that's fine
A	or Asda
B	yeah
A	sure they have a setting
B	wait
A	the way we set it
A	oh there's no yeah
B	that fits on like one of the Asdas
A	mm
B	regular size
A	but then we need to know the dimensions
A	yeah we need to know the dimensions for the so we cut it out and the direct the slice
B	mm quite hard I suppose it won't be too hard so long as we've got the dimensions on the internet
A	they they are though yeah we've done our passport photos before
B	well
A	but then do they give you a
A	if it doesn't work it's something like
A	I don't think that's what they mean I think they mean like you can't say if I took a photo of you
B	oh okay
A	here you can't zoom in
B	oh I see
A	and then
B	yeah
A	see what I mean?
B	so we could do it I suppose
A	have you got like a blank wall?
B	not cream or grey
B	my sister's room is a plain white wall
B	cos that visa that is an online application and print
A	that's the part we needed
B	yeah I need to send off passport
A	it sounds really easy now
B	yeah I've just got to
A	right
A	okay
B	bit
A	so the Uzbek one do you wanna send it off today?
B	no
A	just
B	you need a passport
A	oh is it actually you've gotta send it off?
B	oh yeah your passport's gotta go with it
A	oh right
B	and postal order payment which we don't even know
A	for a postal order?
B	no for the
A	oh okay erm
B	Uzbek doesn't actually say there
A	no I think it's
B	really?
A	it's quite a lot
B	is that a hotel or that's a hostel hostel is different is it?
A	yeah hostels are English so English and
B	and also hotels
A	not really
B	well erm well
A	okay
A	yeah but there's also one down here saying
B	so a hundred dollars?
A	mm
B	what do they say is photo size? let's have a look
A	yeah
B	they'll fit on but have the that specific size that do prints yeah so has the photo printing
A	do you know how to change I don't know why it changed but it used to be like shift and three was pound but now I have to do alt and three and it changed it just changed randomly
B	I don't know and I have no idea how to get the hash key until ages ago
B	oh right
A	I forgot I forgot what it is now it's like control alt for hash yeah I just couldn't couldn't do it oh wrong one
A	yeah
B	that was do like if you press command and a number it takes you to that tab that's open
A	I was trying to find out cos I did something weird I think see it doesn't do it sometimes though
B	okay
A	oh maybe mine's different control? mm?
B	six by four that's the
B	got Paintbrush you do a width in pixels
A	I dunno
B	yeah Paintbrush
A	and it's like hidden
B	I just searched it and got it up
A	mm it's not it's not online
B	well like if you have you you used er
A	no oh
B	oh like we we can use photo can't photos
A	yeah you can do that I'm pretty sure but I was thinking about just doing it on Word
B	yeah
A	so and so you just copy and paste it and save it as a PDF and I'm pretty sure you can just print PDFs on the machines
B	mm I don't know a lot of the quality might deteriorate though
A	so you you want to have it as a JPEG?
B	pretty much yeah
A	can you do that in Word? saving it
B	no I don't think so
A	can you not save erm like on the loads of pictures together as an image and then save that as a picture?
B	mm I see what you mean
A	let's just try that
B	I think well I smashed it
A	yeah
A	nice
B	all different countries apparently
A	oh well ours is the same as that or slightly different?
B	I don't know
A	yeah there's not that much variation
B	no
A	okay let's do them and
B	I think you so you select your paper size so six by four if you print to Asda do you want a border? no select your image
A	so load a file that kind of one
B	there you go picture or image
B	it keeps the aspect for you and you just put it onto
A	looks pretty good
B	and finish lovely jubbly
A	yeah
B	then you cut very carefully
A	how much do you reckon it is for each one? you like like on the internet?
B	yeah we're talking pence I think
A	is it? although and
B	there you go
A	where did you get that? that's a bit quick
A	what?
B	I got it before
A	ah
B	so it's six by four
A	yeah yeah
B	so say twenty-five P
A	for six?
A	stupid
B	yeah cos we said six by four didn't we?
A	yeah that that yeah
B	mm
A	okay that's just six on the
B	well it's thirty-five
A	mm?
B	is that wider than it is tall or what? what do you say?
A	I would say it's taller than it is wide
A	that's pretty good
B	well let's try it go and see what it comes out as
A	yeah you got like a ruler?
A	it would be good if they put a little erm a gap in between them
B	there there is a slight gap but it's not fantastic
A	mm
B	it's square
A	yeah
B	oh I didn't mate
B	I didn't oh they refreshed the page
A	yeah
B	six by four inch what's this four out here?
A	now we've got all this shit round the edges now
A	oh this was about that
B	and six three across will be six
A	uhu
B	it's like but yeah that's right isn't it that's what we want
A	yeah
B	it's that's six by four size
A	better be
B	yeah is that right though? you
A	yes
B	I can't do maths in my head do four point five divided by three point five please
A	one point two eight
B	okay and now do four ten divided by five thirty
A	four point seven seven
B	mm?
A	nought point seven seven
B	oh right mm sorry do five thirty divided by four ten
B	but divide by what? four
A	four ten
A	one point two nine
B	so it looks good doesn't it perfect
A	so yeah that's cos you
B	so do we need to take a picture? do that to it get and print out three times for sixty P

A	okay
B	the overall size of it
A	yeah yeah
B	it's like that
A	oh so that I thought that was for each individual
B	oh no no
A	oh okay
B	so six six inches is
A	what shall I say is the start date?
B	to what?
A	I'm trying to find start
B	is it thirty day?
A	it isn't it's it's tourist so I say whenever
B	just put like five days before we enter
B	where do we enter Uzbek from?
A	Turkmenistan
B	okay
A	yeah we can do it erm
B	oh good spot on
A	but there's no passport collection facility in
B	yeah so we have to pay for it to be mailed back do we?
A	it's a tenner I think
B	sorry?
A	we're saving a tenner cos it's like a hundred and forty-five and it works out to a hundred and thirty-five
B	oh right okay so what how much is the visa? like ninety-five quid or something?
A	erm well it was like sixty about sixty-five and then the service fee of forty quid and the documents is twenty quid
B	but wait service fee to the embassy for doing the visa?
B	yeah
A	mm
A	purpose of visit what do we say? it says brackets in detail
B	in detail? cities we're gonna visit then
A	well I we've put our route of transiting through the territory
B	right
A	doing
B	to see the sights
B	I think we should do that
A	you think we should?
B	I don't think we'll be
A	well
B	we'll be transiting from from where to where
A	uhu
B	I don't think we'll hear any more than that
A	no yeah but tourist trip driving through Uzbekistan to see the sights oh the inviting party
B	inviting party?
A	then in brackets it says inviting organisation or person
B	oh yeah
A	er so we don't need to apply supply an address in
B	what what was the application for this one?
A	well it says address in Uzbekistan and there's a star next to it I don't reckon that star will matter
B	well we'll find out I guess when we try and get to the next page
A	yeah it says previous trips to Uzbekistan none accompanying persons I'll put your name and occupation students place of work like that's a university student work also the address
B	mm for what?
B	yeah
A	instead of leaving it blank
B	yeah
A	the fields address in Uzbekistan is empty erm in fact when we're travelling in
B	mm I think that's the view if
A	oh yeah okay we're gonna stay for three days to be honest
B	wow
B	erm Tripadvisor stuff here for erm she apply she applied three
B	erm no
A	uhu
B	as a tourist and she had no problems

A	I'm starving don't like lying
B	it's not lying I suppose
A	it is
B	if we could we'd stay there
A	well we could do shall we stay there? where is it?
B	I'd put a proper hotel to be honest
A	well yeah well
B	is that bad?

B	if they query us like we'll just be like well don't need one so fuck off
A	what? I don't understand it says check up a format of the fill field address in Uzbekistan what's that?
