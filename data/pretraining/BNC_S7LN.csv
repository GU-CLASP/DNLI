A	have you had a good weekend?
B	I did yeah
A	oh brilliant
B	oh yeah it was Mother's Day
A	aw
B	and stuff
A	yeah
B	we just  spent the day together you know
A	well you know it was okay
B	oh lovely
A	yeah he's too little really to do anything else
B	yeah
A	which school is that?
B	it's the one in
A	oh right yeah
B	it's just the mornings
A	that's the same thing as they have in Lode you know where I live
B	yeah I think it's good
A	yeah
B	well I don't really know because I don't pick her up
A	oh brilliant
B	Cos she's only three
A	yeah that sounds good
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	she's quite demanding
A	well my son actually
B	it's not chicken pox is it?
A	I'm not quite sure actually because it's like you know
B	oh it's horrible
A	yeah
B	chicken pox is going around
A	ah lucky you
B	so can he go to childcare today?
A	well he didn't go
B	yeah
A	he normally goes to a child-minder three days a week and to grandparents two days a week so
B	did you sort out your child-minder problem cos you were looking for someone weren't you?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	yeah
B	yeah perfect
A	yeah no it's pretty good yeah
B	mine's not far
A	how's your day been today?
B	eh it's been good cos today is an easy day for me I only teach two lessons
A	did you find it in the end or not?
B	no no
A	oh yeah it was the same thing today at the doctors as well you know
B	mm
A	oh yeah
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	it's a shame really
A	Cos the school I used to work at
B	it's ridiculous
A	oh brilliant
B	I mean it's just ridiculous isn't it? They've opted they're doing a GSCE but to get them to speak German which is why they should me in my classroom I actually had to bribe them
A	that actually works
B	I have to reward them with bags of chocolate
A	well in in real life nobody will give them Maltesers for speaking German sadly
B	no exactly
A	I used to just em when I was doing work experience I was kind of em just assisting really you know the teacher who was you know working with a class who opted to do German
B	yeah it's nerve wracking
A	well I kind of thought the exchange trips are probably incentive enough
B	I took twenty kids to well seventeen to em to Germany at half term
A	I know
B	you're either going to do it or you're not
A	I think so
B	mm
A	Cos when I was working in the language school I had the same problem
B	mm
A	even though I spoke English to them they spoke German between themselves
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but it it I mean it's obvious
A	mm
B	it's contrived otherwise
A	yeah the mixed ones are a lot more fun because erm you know it's it's actually nice to see how they interact with each other and without knowing they actually help each other which which is great
B	yeah
A	even with the normal classes just like you know in mainstream schools
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so were you teaching English as a foreign language?
A	em I was yeah
B	mm
A	so yeah I trained in
B	so that's not TEFL or?
A	eh it's eh yeah
B	what's it called?
A	CELTA
B	oh Okay
A	and TEFL is just like a general umbrella term for Teaching English as a Foreign Language
B	so why aren't you teaching English as a foreign language now? Did you?
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	and if they're for example school aged students then you have to wait till they have like a holiday or something like that you know a break from third term
B	oh I see
A	and then so you know
B	and actually when you have children that's not what you want
A	no absolutely
B	yeah I'd love to do that actually
A	well actually  they're doing this starting this course now for
B	are they? Oh wow
A	yeah they they just literally
B	mm
A	no no no I'm just sorting out some resources
B	they must have the teacher already I suppose
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah I could see that being a career move later in life
A	I can relate to that
B	well primary is busy isn't it? I don't think you get as much free time
A	and you have to teach everything as well every subject
B	yeah
A	well at the moment in Linton
B	I don't know it
A	it's a very very small school
B	what age does he teach then?
A	oh just all ages
B	okay
A	yeah no he doesn't really have much experience with very very young ones you know
B	yeah exactly
A	but it's different when they're your own kids
B	I don't really like little kids
A	yeah
B	oh completely
A	yeah
B	yeah we're going to go to em Italy for a week
A	sounds good
B	yeah it will be good cos this time which is unusual my my mum and dad are going to come to
A	sounds interesting
B	A full house
A	is it's a very big garden?
B	it
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	well my my in-laws are actually working hard on their garden cos they just literally moved into their new house and there's a lot of work
B	oh do they?
A	so
B	I'm amazed he finds the time
A	that's because he gets up at like half five
B	he goes in the morning
A	he yeah
B	oh really
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I can relate to that definitely
B	I didn't even have one on Sunday cos I
A	well I'm just definitely looking forward to a time when eh my son is a teenager and he
B	yeah I think so
A	sounds good so I can sleep as well
B	I'm looking forward to that too
A	ah
B	it is hard though isn't it with little ones? Working and having little ones
A	yeah definitely
B	mm
A	it's eh it's

A	well it was initially you know
B	oh really? Do you write as well as illustrate or?
A	eh yeah yeah
B	oh I see
A	it was a lot of work
B	oh wow
A	but hopefully now when it's  when it's  done you know hopefully it will  it will  look good
B	that's amazing
A	yeah
