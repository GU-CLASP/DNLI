A	but luckily like it was kind of comfy there and it was cheap and like the toilet was good so it wasn't too bad
B	did you have air con?
A	yeah I did
B	course you did
A	yep
B	it wasn't so bad in Cambodia without it though was it?
A	no cos the fan was massive but in Battambang it was horrible
B	yeah
A	er but yeah I had air con in the dorm there and it was needed cos Chiang Mai was quite hot
B	yeah
A	and after I started taking the antibiotics like on the day after I was much better
B	did you do er that after I told you to cos I told you to take antibiotics didn't I
A	no
B	I recommended a few antibiotics to you and then the next thing I knew was that you'd been taking them
A	yeah I used I used your suggestions
B	yeah good stuff
A	and found that Ciprofloxacin
B	the Ciprofloxacin yeah
A	yes
B	I do that when I've had it for like four or five days now it's time to take some antibiotics
A	yeah
B	and usually within two or three days it clears up again
A	yeah within within the day it felt so much better like for the first time I woke up and didn't need to immediately shit
B	yeah just don't get into the habit of taking them every time you get sick you know cos it's there's not much you could do probably
A	yeah
B	but erm I'm glad you did cos you started talking about going to the doctors and I was thinking no no no you need to at least try a course of antibiotics on your own before you before you do that
A	mm
B	if that doesn't clear it up then go to the doctors
A	yeah but that sorted me out and then I I went zip lining
B	oh sweet
A	erm
B	was that fun?
A	yeah it was good I did a cooking course
B	it wasn't like that episode of South Park?
A	no
B	have you seen that one?
A	yes
B	little did they know that something or other is fun
A	erm I did a cooking course
B	so I'm not going to keep all this fat erm I'm gonna put a bit in here
A	yeah
B	sweet
A	and I did like a two day tour where I saw the erm national park and like the
B	okay
A	so yeah of
B	you you did elephant something or other but it wasn't the same as what I was talking about was it it was like
A	yeah it was different have you seen this picture?
B	the one of you riding on its head?
A	no this one
B	oh the one that you got mum?
A	yeah
B	yeah I did see that
A	that was in Chiang Rai that was like a cultural
B	heritage place yeah
A	thing and there was a bunch of dancers like
B	this is a bit random
A	yeah
B	sounds good
A	yeah
B	I'm glad you had such a good time travelling
A	yeah I did I had a really good time
B	you can see why I've been doing it so much
A	yeah it's amazing
B	yeah
A	I'd kind of be I'd be willing to go on my own again definitely
B	yeah good
A	erm
B	just bear in mind that some places aren't quite as easy to travel
A	yeah
B	as those parts of the world but as you get more and more experience it will be easy
A	yeah er then I got the bus to Pai
B	yeah
A	but it was
B	what from me or from other people?
A	just from other people like oh my god you nearly die
B	I mean people are pansies sometimes
A	yeah the the
B	yeah
A	it was kind of just fun
B	and you motorbiked back from there didn't you?
A	yeah
B	which is pretty fun
A	oh did you see my hotel I got in Pai?
B	no
A	it was outrageous it was all pink
A	it was a Hello Kitty hotel
B	oh I think I did see that
A	yeah
B	I was like what?
A	it was a Hello Kitty hotel
A	staying there
B	it's a bit of a random place to stay in Pai isn't it? it's not
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I booked a couple of days there and I get there and oh my god it's all pink
A	like the whole building is pink
A	and inside is pink and the bed sheets are pink and you've got Hello Kitty bed sheets and alarm clock and
B	oh no
A	yeah so I like went and complained and then obviously they don't speak very good English so I had trouble trying to actually converse with them
B	that yeah
A	yeah
B	they stuck you in another room and there was a frog?
A	there was like a frog jumping around there were erm oh
B	ugh
A	and the shower
A	it was pretty bad
B	so it was classic
A	yeah and there was tons of mosquitos as well and the door didn't properly close
A	and you had to use like erm a padlock erm er
B	your own padlock?
A	no a padlock they gave you but er it it the door would like hang out and then it was just a padlock kind of
A	so easily
B	not good then
A	anyone outside would have just heard me like er ah
A	yeah
B	did you have the uhu
A	no I didn't have that
B	uhu
B	yeah
B	Pai is nice though isn't it
A	yeah
B	I imagine it's changed quite a bit now from how it was
A	yeah
B	when I was there
A	but I wasn't happy with the room again cos it was shit and it was actually not that cheap
B	no
A	so I was like well I'm paying the proper rate here for a crappy room erm
A	so I went and complained again and I ended up having to phone up the manager and like arguing with him and saying look I want my money back I'm gonna write you a bad review
B	right
A	and eventually they gave me a better room and that one was okay
B	oh fortunate so complaining worked?
A	yeah
B	I normally don't complain I just leave
A	I felt like leaving but I was out of money
B	yeah
A	and my budget was spent and I was over budget already
B	through your own fault?
A	yeah
B	well you did choose to go to Hello Kitty hotel
A	yeah
B	surely the guy at the end was like why are you here?
A	yeah
B	no
A	and like I'd I'd be getting picked up to go on like erm that elephant trek and erm like they they pull up outside the road in a in a a pickup truck with people just hanging out the back for you to get in
A	and I'm like er you can see them all looking at me and I don't know laughing I'm like you should see inside my room it's even better
B	yeah
A	so it was quite funny
B	so it was worth the experience
A	yeah
B	random
A	oh
B	I presume you were just busy or something weren't you
A	er what do you mean? when I was in Pai or Chiang Mai?
B	yeah you were sick in Chiang Mai and we didn't get a reply from you for ages and it like worried the crap out of mum and then
A	oh like I was just the same
B	yeah
A	so I didn't really see any need to update
B	it's just cos you scared mum cos you'd send a really short message to say I'm still sick
B	it's just sending such a
A	yeah but Pai was so cool
B	yeah
A	and I just went exploring on the scooter
B	that's nice as well
A	they give you a map now I don't know whether you had one of those
B	I don't think I did
A	there are so many like different places to go
B	mm
A	where any direction you go there'll be er little petrol pumps
B	yeah
A	to use and people sat on the roads on the side of the street no
B	nothing?
A	so I start to panic and I go another way and I'm like shit okay I can't find any so I head back
B	into town?
A	yeah
B	oh no
A	so I had to start fucking pushing the damn thing
B	how far?
A	and asking people like where the hell is the damn petrol?
B	how far did you have to push it?
A	oh probably about ten minutes
B	oh it wasn't too bad
A	no
B	yeah normally it just people with like coke bottles or something
A	yeah
B	quicker
A	I'm really slow with potatoes
B	I haven't decided yet do you think it's better to cut these in half or to just have them standing up?
A	they look nice like that
B	you reckon?
A	yep
B	do you ever do stuffed peppers?
A	no
B	you can do what my friend used to do
B	whatever you want
A	I'm sure you can have a stuffed sour gourd
B	that was horrible
A	it was
B	whatever that veg was I couldn't really eat it it grossed me out
A	sour marrow of some kind
B	I don't like bitter anyway
A	yes
B	I guess they just wanted us to try some of the local food
B	the problem is like some of these aren't gonna stand up
A	after erm being in Thailand right I didn't find the Cambodian cuisine like amazingly interesting
B	no it's not no it's not
A	mm
B	what baking pans do you have? what things can I put all these peppers in at the end?
A	okay
B	so is that big enough? oh there's two of them
B	oh we've got trapped
A	you do know it's on lowest right?
B	yeah I'm talking about that
A	yeah you do know it's on its lowest
B	that's fine I'm not telling you to boil quicker I'm telling
A	oh
B	you to do it quicker
A	do I need to do any more after this one?
B	maybe
A	oh right
B	what do you think?
A	I don't really want to do any more
A	we need a potato peeling machine
B	yeah
A	I'm kind of tempted to get a rice cooker for in here
B	do you know what's better than that?
A	what?
B	is a knife
A	no I'm no quicker with a knife
B	oh mate where's a knife? where's like a small knife?
A	er I've tried it before I know better
B	where is a small knife?
A	in there
B	show me a good one
A	no none of them are good
B	what's the name of the small that that's here
A	I don't think it's gonna fit any more in there
B	you could
A	maybe one
B	if you can get it like this
A	god that's so much quicker
B	it is isn't it
A	but I can't do that
B	why can't you do it?
B	yeah that's right
B	I'm I'm rushing it but if you do it quicker and you get better at it you lose less potato
A	no I'm alright
B	oh you're done with them
A	yeah
B	I see
A	yeah no cheese
A	this is bullshit
B	well you could just eat this now
A	that's probably good
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then
A	yeah
B	yeah I did take big chunks off but it's not exactly like you were you weren't doing the same with the peeler
A	you can't take massive chunks off with the peeler
B	you were taking some pretty big chunks off
A	oh maybe
B	I mean look at that you did that
A	ah what one? no that one's yours
B	whatever all these bits chunky chunk that's yours
A	well I don't think it is cos it doesn't fit through the peeler
A	that'd be good
B	mm
A	oh well I should really learn to use a knife
B	yeah you get better at it I'm not always terrible like sometimes you can go just below the skin but I rushed that one
A	mm
B	and to be honest I haven't peeled a potato before
A	yeah just practice I guess
B	where are you off to? do you wanna clean up a bit and then we're done pretty much
A	where are the nice apples?
B	in the fridge
A	I think this one's nice
B	I'll put that back
A	that bit goes on here doesn't it?
B	yeah and erm just clean up and then we're done
