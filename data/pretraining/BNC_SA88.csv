B	right
C	you need to sort of look close and you go around
B	mm
C	I mean a lot of the Vatican would be erm have you been there?
B	er erm
C	is that worth going to?
B	I think the Sistine Chapel I'm not sure I have erm
A	how long were you there?
B	well my passport was stolen which meant that I was there much longer than I would've been and it was very fortunate because one of my mate's dad was the director of the
C	mm
B	the archaeology school
A	girl
B	lived in a kind of studio at the
A	oh did her passport get stolen as well?
B	yeah hers yeah
A	and they never showed up?
B	well erm I
A	it was probably
B	mine might've turned up the point is that I wasn't very
A	oh
B	cos she was dark haired erm
A	yeah
B	you know it was would've been a good but I think mine was the one with the
A	with the long hair?
B	in sixty-nine when I when I lost my passport in

C	don't you have a green card?
B	I do
A	he does
B	but he said
A	he was wrong though right? he was wrong
B	no erm
A	he said
B	he was er I'm if you're away for a long time they begin to get a bit suspicious of whether you er deserve this privilege
B	erm
A	he what did he say? you can't be away from the country for more than oh you have to be in the country for X number of days to retain your green card and we
B	er any any erm
A	we weren't we were not gonna be in the country that long
B	I already had my green what are you talking about?

A	well
B	property
A	even if you wanted to
B	that's right I guess
B	yeah I mean the
A	you're not gonna need it
B	the only thing wrong with my old status was I couldn't earn any money from
A	yeah
B	but that's not you know not very much
A	mm
B	but sometimes it's a thousand dollars though
C	why do they make it so hard?
A	I dunno
B	erm
C	I thought it was easy quite easy for like professional people to go and do work in
A	yeah I know I did too I think it's harder for them than it used to be I'm not sure
B	I mean you'd have to jump through some hoops so
C	just a tiny bit right thanks
A	is that enough?
C	yeah
A	do you want another meat?
C	yeah just one
B	mm
A	hand me your plate so
C	mm like a week?

B	right
C	and they were all
B	right so you never really
A	mm
B	different world
A	totally different
B	that's the nicest part of
A	really?
B	well I'm not really counting just
A	wait what's the neighbourhood
B	just
A	we were in? do you know?
A	mm
B	but it was next to
A	mm it was nice
B	I remember driving through there in the
A	yeah
C	er you mean model for what?
B	mm?
C	model for?
B	erm for a comparison of cities
C	like good model?
B	oh good yeah no I think Sydney's great
C	I don't like it always seems to strike me like as sort of like neo liberal nightmare places
B	what?
C	yeah kind of like not very like
B	neo liberal
C	like very
B	oh I see I'm just talking about
C	oh like architecture?
B	yeah the way it looks er er I don't know is it is it like that?
B	Australia?
C	well I mean I I know that they've got like some
B	oh
A	yeah that's true
C	and like they're you
B	oh
C	I mean lots of people
B	but in Sydney the
C	fucking hate Australia
A	oh really?
C	have you seen this film called Wake in Fright?
B	called what?
C	Wake in Fright
A	mm
C	it's about the like Australian outback it's really good
B	oh
C	it's from the seventies or something
B	is it a spooky
A	they did some really good
C	no
A	horror movies
C	it's like it's not really a
B	oh
C	to make sure the teachers don't like bail
B	oh
C	you like have to sort of you turn yourself into a bondsman
B	oh right
C	so the guy's like oh he's
A	yeah
C	can't escape cos he's
C	but the outback looks the outback looks cool
A	yeah we didn't see that that was one
B	no
A	they seem very straight forward
B	well I I like and also I think they're sort of much less you know sort of there's much more natural equality between
A	but
B	but
A	when you were saying that to
B	I know but they because there is
A	oh oh right
B	but which is true there are these surfing clubs where they have horrible
C	cricket teams
A	yeah that's true
B	and that's all true but then it also has a massive gay community all in all reacting against
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and it's a law it's a law to vote
B	mm?
A	that's a good one that it's er it's illegal not to vote I think that's
B	oh yeah that's
C	I know but then still that guy got in
A	yeah that's
B	but
C	Tony Abbott? sort of
A	but I think he got in
C	probably a year and a half ago
B	right
A	I don't
A	was it a vote? a popular vote? I can't remember
B	they have a
A	mm
B	mm it may well be you're right
A	yeah maybe it was a popular vote well that's what our Australian friend was saying that yeah it's to make people vote but there was also almost exactly the same to any other western country like it's not
B	what?
A	there's no big difference the patterns
B	oh between left and right?
A	of who gets in yeah
B	not much
C	but I find it difficult to believe that in if everybody voted in this country that would be the same
A	I know
B	but
A	I mean that's what I think he was saying you think it might be different but
B	erm you'd in America there's no question
A	yeah
B	the Democrats would go up wouldn't they?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and it's sort of I think the same er here
B	I don't know
A	are you gonna vote?
C	yeah
A	we're not
B	we're well we're not because we won't be here
C	do a post one
B	too late
C	it's not too late
B	I think it is isn't it?
C	twentieth you've gotta do it by sort it out by
B	what?
A	to do it by post?
B	have to you can do it by
C	I mean you just have to do it online and then they send you a
B	oh I oh I we got these voting cards and I thought it said
B	well who are you gonna vote
C	erm what?
B	what will you vote?
C	it doesn't really make a difference
C	in
B	I'll vote for Labour too
B	mm
C	thanks
B	I like Ed
A	I'm gonna
B	but Cameron actually is not is not er
C	he is
B	no because
C	he's pulling the wool over your eyes
A	yeah
B	that's decides it
A	I think for me
C	yeah
A	and it just
B	it's not that it's just that although he's
A	oh
B	remember when we met Blair and I I didn't know what he did at
A	he's did he do PPE?
B	no he did law
A	he did law?
B	yeah and became a lawyer
C	I had some already
B	more?
C	no
B	breads?
C	no thanks
B	mm
A	I don't want any bread
A	it's so annoying
A	god
B	the dust
A	and it's coming
B	I wonder if it's stressful for them to have us around
A	I think they'd prefer to have us not around
B	yeah well
A	but we don't really
B	he didn't ask me a question it was only when I said is there a problem?
A	no he did he asked about the windows
B	oh when the window guy came
A	er we have a shitty architect
B	oh he made a mistake about the beam too
A	he did?
B	yeah cos
A	oh yeah yeah the measurement of the beam yes
B	no but
A	another mistake?
B	yeah it's
C	is he a Polish architect as well?
B	no no
C	yeah well you need to get one
A	I know
B	oh oh I see
A	I know that's what I I think that that team they need to get themselves an architect and an engineer to be a good solid team
A	so you know er do you know
C	yeah I remember going to one of her plays
A	you went to yeah we went to didn't we all go to one together?
B	the the
C	one about deafness
A	yeah
B	the family
A	yeah yeah
B	the stressed family
C	the guy's learning Chinese on his computer her dad
B	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	the the the the the loudmouth dad
A	what do you mean?
B	well er it's funny that she sort of said oh the the
C	oh yeah we watched a play
B	and the doctor
C	not really
B	yeah not really yeah
A	we played
B	he was into cricket perfectly alright bloke but a bit too blokey really
A	yeah
B	and then she felt so sorry for him
A	why did she feel so sorry for him?
B	oh because but because he behaved like a bit of a jerk and he just wanted to play football with his friends and
A	oh right
B	he was
A	anyway
B	I'm gonna have a
A	I am full
C	I'm full as well
B	half
B	good
A	but you're gonna keep eating
A	oh my god
C	really?
A	yeah
B	I just couldn't stop
A	we just couldn't believe it we were just
B	er there's my precious supply you know
A	cos it
B	yeah we made a hundred and ten I think
B	yeah
A	and there he
B	and I thought great now we've got suppers for ages pre prepared
A	it was amazing
A	he must've been fucking starving
A	no he was so happy
B	he's the guy
A	oh yeah I wonder if you've ever heard of any of his bands probably not
B	no
A	er do you are you
B	indie band
A	are you into music at all?
C	no
B	that's so weird
A	you used to be
C	yeah
B	you should get back into it
A	do you play
C	no
A	guitar or anything
C	I play the piano some occasionally
B	well it's always there
A	yeah
C	just not that good er I
B	there is what?
B	there is so much good music
A	I was not that into music
C	I mean there's
B	well there's but I mean that's
C	yeah
B	more great music than you could ever listen to in a lifetime
C	yeah but does it I think it it's
B	you can't there's too much
C	it's not but like when you listen to the those songs you will think about like in your life when you first heard them and stuff and
B	I think that
A	there's no connection maybe
A	you know
C	well there is
B	there are lots of factors here cos in the old days you didn't have much money and you bought an LP
A	maybe they were just more common
B	and you'd really really thought about what you'd get and you couldn't listen
C	it's free yeah
B	you can just get
A	oh to?
B	anything you want at any time
A	what is that called?
B	Spotify
A	mm
C	well it's free on it's all on Youtube as well free
A	yeah
B	erm
A	do you and your friends listen to
B	I think it's destroyed I think you're
A	in the background?
C	at parties and stuff yeah but not like
A	but it's not like you sit together and you say hey let's listen to this new album
C	no no way
A	see we even in my generation
C	like some of
A	we used to do this
C	some of my friends quite like
B	well of course you're pre
C	music they like sort of like blues and they'll put it on at like dinner just quiet
A	yeah
B	you're
C	and stuff
A	yeah
B	you're pre internet still
A	yeah yeah I guess maybe that has something to do with
B	and it's no
A	it was an activity
B	I think it's
A	yeah I guess it is
B	it's just destroyed something I reckon
C	yeah but I don't well don't really listen to them now
B	mm?
C	don't really er yeah but I don't listen to them now
B	so
A	well there must be other things like that now but just not that
B	no everything's online
A	I don't know
B	book any old book
A	that's true

C	matched my breathing to his breathing I would fall asleep

B	but
A	it's paperback
B	paperback yellow and green I opened it I looked at it
C	you should be able to
B	I
A	no it's not eye catching
B	something is
B	something
A	it's not like he showed it to me it's not eye catching
B	no it's not eye catching
A	it's not
B	not with there are so many but oh
A	yeah she could've stacked it somewhere easily
B	well I've looked through all this
A	I mean
A	it wouldn't be in that other room cos er we
B	no
A	just haven't gone in there
B	it could not possibly be
A	see I feel like you opened it down here
B	well I wonder whether I kind of
A	because you said
B	because I wanted to protect it
A	I said what's that?
B	whether I
A	and you said it's a present for
B	er I might've shoved it in a bookcase just to protect it and then
A	oh my god my eyes are
B	what?
A	I'm having
B	oh
A	yeah
A	oh fuck
C	what's Sperm Wars?
A	what? really?
B	oh that's really interesting
B	so all the little sperms are fighting it out
B	what? well it's really interesting cos it's one of the natural
A	did you look through all this stuff like?
B	I don't know
A	I mean she could've easily stacked it up there because if she was
B	what happened to all the cookbooks when I? where did I put them?
A	you put the cookbooks in there
B	in where?
A	I think in that cupboard
B	oh
C	yeah I don't
A	it wouldn't be in the window?
B	in what window? what do you mean? oh
B	of course
A	you didn't put it in the bag of things for
B	no
B	yes?
A	you didn't put it in the
B	no I really don't think so no I didn't cos I emptied that out
A	oh
C	why is there? what's the theme for this bookcase?
B	mm? what?
C	what's the theme for this bookcase?
B	the theme is well there's er travel and then er interesting oddities er most of these books were in your bedroom when you were a kid
C	maybe I should er take that?
B	oh yeah why not? why not? that's a good idea that's always useful so I can't see it
C	they've only got two lines on the metro
B	what? oh it might how old is it?
C	I guess that's a problem with a city like I remember erm reading about them trying to build a tunnel under the
B	something beautiful?
B	oh excavate yeah that's something I have no idea when this was
C	I learnt about sort of why everything ended up in Constantinople because because it was founded as a Christian city all the sort of old the reason why certain emperors didn't take statues out of certain sites is cos it would be sort of against the
B	who didn't take them out?
C	well you know Nero would do what he wants but he's not gonna take the
B	no
C	because er
B	that's true that's true
C	but when you Constantine's doing it he can take whatever he wants cos he doesn't believe in it
B	he doesn't believe in it that's true
C	so everything went to
B	right
C	they well then it sort of just like they put it up there they had so many wars and
B	yeah
C	half of it
B	those
C	half of it probably got turned into cannonballs
B	oh
B	those cities in in Asia Minor like Ephesus were just vast rich and I can't see a date here I mean it could be like
C	how can it not have a date? it's such
B	I can't find it it's it's not good
C	I thought they always had to have like
B	yeah I think they do I'm mystified maybe they maybe they don't cos they don't want
C	doesn't even have a sort of ISBN number
B	mm? doesn't it?
C	oh yeah it does yeah yeah it does can you
B	mm?
C	it cost eight quid so
B	so
C	that seems about what it should cost though
B	it does it does
C	yeah it's twenty isn't it?
B	or more I think the hardback was fifty quid or something
C	I saw I saw that clock in a bar the other day
B	did you?
C	I
B	erm well everyone's gonna have a different seventy-eight that's a seventy-eight record there erm and this one I think this one is Beethoven
C	can I see?
B	huh? yeah I do love it
C	they're heavy those records
B	they are
B	oh
C	what's that? the doorbell?
B	what?
C	what is that?
B	yes it's the doorbell did it fall off?
C	yeah
B	how bizarre
A	I've been through all of those I've been through that I've been through everywhere
B	I've been through them three times
A	you've lost it
A	or erm
B	is that your bag or my bag?
A	did you? this is mine
A	did you look
B	yeah I did yeah
A	oh is that?
B	so
A	mm
B	he just sent me a paper
A	that he wrote?
B	he's just written it about why things like believing that all is one or
A	oh
A	well why does he think it makes people feel good?
A	I don't see why panpsychism is gonna make people feel good
B	no nor do I really but
A	I can see why believing all is one that might seem like
B	I don't think it makes me feel better
B	and I don't really
A	unity there's a
B	well it
B	there's this classic paper called Positive Illusions and it just proved that if people have certain
B	are happier and but I just think if you you have to go for the truth and accept to be less happy
A	yeah
C	but that's that thing in the you remember that bit in The Matrix? erm
B	oh
C	it's not in the first one it's in the
A	oh yeah and he's
C	he's eating the steak
A	yeah
C	and he's like
C	I don't
A	yeah
C	just make me forget
A	mm
B	oh yeah
C	you see I don't care that it's not real
A	yeah cos it's really interesting because there's been sort of a change in er that's a classic thought experiment in philosophy and that's erm been done for decades and it used to be that all the students wanted to know the truth they
C	yeah
A	just live in the
B	oh my god
A	and now it's changing and they're starting to think
B	virtual reality
A	yeah no I'm happy to be in the
A	in the illusion
B	well there's also this paper did I ever send it to you?
B	it's much more likely
B	than anything else
A	oh
B	no there
A	kind of a fucked up simulation
B	Jonathan Glover did
B	Jonathan yeah exactly
C	why do they have to make it so fucked up then?
A	I dunno
B	well
C	it like beggars belief how fucked up it is er so it's hard to
A	yeah
B	well
C	it can't like be wilfully designed like that
A	well maybe there was some
B	no he could've just put in a lot of
A	parameters and then
B	a lot of initial conditions
A	yeah
B	and then he just let the whole thing run
A	yeah
B	there are these
C	he? he
A	yeah
B	that's what you know Dawkins used to do with these evolution programmes you just put in a very few very simples rules and you watch how they evolve
A	oh yeah
B	experience machine
A	yeah
B	and it's all like integrated so they all live with each other they're real
A	yeah
B	and they're living a coherent life and then on the machine they just er the
C	there was that
A	that's quite a good twist
C	they do that in a film what's that film? erm like one of those it's like one of those actors it's like a British film that has all those actors that are always in those British films
A	the five British actors
B	you mean the sort of Four Weddings and a Funeral people?
C	yeah well this is I think it's like Mike something or
B	Mike something? Michael Caine?
C	no he's like oh what is?
B	mm
C	what's it called?
B	not the not the what's
A	mm
B	where they keep dissolving on the?
A	yeah but it's not that one
C	it's like when this guy
B	do you know what he's talking about?
C	this guy the dad
A	mm
C	he really likes Charles Dickens or whatever
A	no
C	but then er yeah something to do with him having a kid and I think he
A	he's changed it yeah
A	mm
B	come within a hundred years of your own time would you go would you be more interested in going forward or back?
C	er back probably
B	me too there are so many things I know about that I'd like to see what they really were
A	oh that is bullshit
B	no it's not bullshit
A	but that is not why you don't wanna go forward a hundred years
B	no it isn't
A	that's just some other little
C	like
A	thing you're going on
C	well it's all fucking over and that's it
B	I was just trying to give people an
C	but I think it depends how it works cos like life would be really
A	hang out yeah
C	you know what I mean?
B	you wouldn't actually go you see you know it's
C	yeah but I'd like to go for
B	Cicero giving the
C	yeah for a week
A	that'd be cool
B	no but and you could
C	you won't understand it
A	oh yeah
B	oh it wouldn't matter
A	no he does this or
C	no
B	apparently he went to this kind of
A	he taught him
B	it was the
C	oh yeah I
A	you don't remember them
B	what book?
