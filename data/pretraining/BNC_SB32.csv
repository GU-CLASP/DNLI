A	she didn't want the ambulance this time so she took him home in a
B	oh crikey
A	but they called one anyway
B	and the ambulance came what did they say?
A	well they took him in didn't they? and he was there till half past nine at night
B	and what have they said?
A	well it was a Saturday it was busy well they dunno what's wrong with him again nothing
B	again?
A	yeah
B	isn't that like the fourth or fifth time now?
A	yes but it's always when he's in Morrisons and shopping
C	she's agreed she's not taking him to Morrisons anymore then
C	they came back and the car was on the drive right?
A	oh
C	and before they come back in the car they'd had a conversation
A	this is with with your dad
A	on the way back from the hospital on the way
C	yeah
A	back from the hospital with your dad
C	I was crying erm yeah they'd had a conversation right grandpa was saying grandpa says in the well the
B	yeah it has to be in the garage

C	they said okay we're gonna agree grandma says yes okay that's fine grandpa said yes okay yeah the car's staying on the drive for the night it's fine
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	anyway they get in two two minutes within getting in grandpa puts his coat back on to go outside
B	oh
C	I'm gonna put the car in the garage dad said we agreed that it's safe
B	oh no
C	so
A	he took his coat off didn't he? and he
C	took his coat off it was fine yeah okay
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	oh did we? fine
A	here we go
C	erm anyway grandma said oh he'll well he'll probably er be up in the middle of the night to go and put it on in the garage anyway dad left them to it fine he hadn't been up in the middle of the night he'd obviously forgotten all about it but they woke up in the morning grandma rang the insurance company to tell them
C	that the car had been on the drive and out of the garage
C	overnight can you imagine being on the end of that call?
C	and they said apparently what did the
C	the guy on the end of the phone said yes well we'll be getting back to you with some more information about it soon
C	as if just to say please don't contact us again
B	oh god
A	go away what are they like?
C	it's what they do she just calls people
B	to tell them that the car's been on the drive
B	oh dear
C	it's a
A	it's something to do isn't it?
C	it's what she just likes to do
A	it's because she spends most of the time on the phone to me your dad or
C	and the amount of people that she calls
A	with completely random stuff
C	she has to call at least one person a day from from somewhere so yeah it's obviously poor poor Morrisons today with the turkey crown
A	I wonder if they recorded that
A	car insurance one that's gonna be one they'll play back in the training
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah try not to lose it
A	I mean
B	oh dear how did grandpa's cataracts go?
A	it hurt more this time which is what nan said when she had her second one done so he said it was painful but he's had it done
B	mm
A	but he
unknown_female	mm
C	no
B	ah
C	dad said well it's quite easy to tell cos you could just cover one and
B	yeah
C	whichever one you can't see out of then that's the one
B	yeah didn't know?
A	no
unknown_female	mm
B	lost it
C	he's really bad now but
B	yeah
C	but you know like oh nan was round the other day wasn't she?
C	auntie
A	yeah
B	who? nan?
A	she was okay but I think she's just had enough after a certain length of time hasn't she?
C	well I don't think
A	I think about
C	she was very happy since the moment she got there to be honest
A	what? got to mine?
C	mm
A	don't you think? why?
C	mm dunno she was just very
A	I think how she's been over the last twelve months that to me was
C	oh yeah yeah well it was better still but I think she's
A	she was chatty at the dinner table
C	yeah yeah but anyway we were talking about grandma and grandpa and she was saying oh no you all laugh but
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	you know hell I said well she actually doesn't make it any easier for herself
A	no she makes it worse
B	yeah
C	she makes it so much worse
B	mm
C	if she just I dunno
C	to find out what was in it grandma should've just said no I've made it
A	yeah
C	there's some
A	steak and kidney or something
B	yeah
C	there's some beef in it that's it
B	yeah
C	and he would've eaten it it would've been fine but she makes it
B	yeah
C	so much worse for herself
A	she goes along with him oh I don't know actually oh oh well er we don't know
C	yeah
B	that's because she's turning a bit loopy too
C	no she's
B	she is
C	isn't she's
A	she's
C	well she's
C	she's
B	mm yeah but she that's the thing cos she's never done any different so she's not gonna start doing it different now and as
A	oh they've filled out the form
A	you know I said they could
A	have the Attendance Allowance and they should go for this Attendance Allowance?
B	mm
A	cos grandad had it
B	for the carers yeah
C	yeah
A	when he wasn't well did I tell you this
B	to be looked after cos grandpa needs looking after?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah so because he's got an actual diagnosis for dementia he's entitled to I think the minimum now is fifty-five pounds a week goes up to about eighty-five or ninety-five but that's for terminally ill people that need a lot more care
C	right
A	but obviously he can't look after himself
B	no
A	but erm but as we've said he's never been able to look after himself his entire life but he he can't he's got the
B	no he definitely can't
A	the doctor doesn't think he'll get it but we said we'd fill it out so your dad took it round and first of all she wasn't filling it out under any circumstances it wants too much information disclosing your dad said you haven't
C	yeah she wasn't going to give her national insurance number to anyone
A	I said they're just checking you're not some Polish immigrant that's just arrived
B	yeah
A	claiming benefits
B	yeah
A	well I'm not telling them that I'm not
C	no I'm not telling them that
A	said well you've got to tell them that and then we told her you haven't gotta disclose any of your assets because it's not a means-tested allowance
B	no
A	you know you're entitled to it just because you know no matter whether you've got a million pounds or ten pounds
B	mm
A	so it's not means-tested so I said well you know you should fill it out took a week sort of thinking about it didn't it? and then she did fill it out then she phoned me up and she said oh hello
B	yeah
A	oh no this the anytime next week there's no
A	there's no rush at all he's very busy I know he does a lot there's no rush at all I'd like him to come over and look over the form I've filled out the form but I would like him to have a quick look before I send it off just to he's much better at these things than me I said okay so I told him and he says oh I says there's no rush well of course twenty-four hours later she phoned
B	yeah
B	yeah
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	well anyway I said just go and sort the form out he was gone hours she'd put yes and no to every question
A	and he said if there was a maybe she'd've ticked that as well
A	every single question well sometimes yes sometimes no
B	I can imagine her saying
A	had to print the form out and start again he was there hours
A	he said well she said well er it is yes and it's no
A	and it depends what day it is and she said I'm not saying I'm a carer if he thinks I'm being paid to care for him he'll insist on me doing even more
A	dad said but you are a carer
B	yeah yeah
A	and it it's filled out in his name he's you know it's his allowance but she wouldn't
A	answer the questions correctly and then if she did she just put everything down to it
B	mm yeah that's true
A	anyway we haven't heard back about that yet but what a nonsense he said it was ridiculous
B	so it just means that
A	well she should get money a week I mean she complains that she doesn't like cooking every day
B	yeah
A	so I said well why don't you buy these Wiltshire Farm Foods?
B	Wiltshire Farm Foods
A	two ninety-five it says they start at you can get a brochure you can choose and
B	mm
A	and it comes
B	uhu
A	you know delivered
unknown_female	yeah
C	and have so much fun picking
B	oh god imagine
A	yeah but it's better than having him pass out at Morrisons every week
C	mm
B	yeah
A	erm then she said er some of my friends have had that and they said there's not enough gravy and I said well make gravy
A	you know he eats copious quantities of gravy? well I said just make some more gravy with it
B	gravy and custard
A	yeah exactly oh well er no I
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm and I said well if you get the Attendance Allowance if you're getting fifty-five pounds a week you can put some of that towards
B	yeah
A	buying your ready meals
B	mm
A	no no no I get sick of talking to her cos when you try and offer a bit of help she just what a stupid thing to say there's not and my friend said there's not enough gravy which friends?
B	mm
B	yeah
A	with the with the
C	oh that one
A	is she going to eat it?
A	I mean er
A	it's ridiculous what do you think
C	oh
A	oh they're bonkers aren't they? they are
B	they're so crazy
C	they are they're getting he's getting really bad
A	well
B	he broke his toe or something?
C	yeah
A	oh was that what he did?
C	that's what he did he broke his toe
A	oh is that all?
C	yeah I yeah I told you because the way grandma went er on about it you'd've thought
A	oh I thought there was
C	he was in a coma
A	yeah well I thought
unknown_female	I thought he was
C	no he broke his toe
B	no I was here when grandma told us
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	this is the first
B	before
A	journey he's had
C	cos she was she was telling me well he can't he can't drive he can't drive you know he's he's doing all this
B	cos he took them back after Christmas didn't he?
C	yeah yeah he's done er he's done this and it's it was a really bad accident and I said oh okay is he off work then? oh no he's going to work I said well how's he getting there? oh well he's going on his bike and the bus said well it can't be that bad then can it?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	if he can walk
A	yeah oh anyway
B	didn't he he had a collision with another biker?
A	yes but
unknown_female	mm
C	oh he's a known
A	he's a he's a known
C	he's a known crasher
A	accident causer yes and then you know but for making out it's not his fault and cycling off so
C	oh
A	it's known throughout the village so
C	ah
A	that little boy's having a long sleep isn't he?
A	I did just walk out of nowhere though
B	mm his hair's got loads lighter hasn't it?
A	yeah it has
B	wonder what it'll grow back like
C	probably blonde
B	you think?
A	yeah I think he'll be blonde yeah
A	what do you think
B	blondie baby
A	so we have to go to the airport quite early tomorrow
B	mm
A	she said well we'll need a big meal and it's half-term so we've got to get there two and a half hours before the flight and they've got the tickets so I can't get there any later so
A	missed your chance
C	you'll probably be alright with that won't you?
A	well yeah wouldn't be so bad would it? but your dad's had his lesson now he's all all geared up isn't he?
C	oh it was so funny watching him yesterday
C	like a stork
C	ah
A	then I kept giving him er instruction you were dying to
B	was he good?
A	get on the ice er on the snow I thought he looked okay
C	he could use a little bit more practice
A	well
C	he was almost like
B	once he has a couple of days
C	he was almost like leaning back like sitting back like that whereas you should be
B	you are quite rigid though aren't you? when you first start
A	then they were told him he was up on one foot when he did his corners
C	he went over the jump by accident
C	he didn't he didn't have enough speed to jump and he did like
C	to plough and turn and
B	yeah
C	oh it was all er it was all a bit hit-and-miss for a minute
B	and he could turn okay?
C	yeah he just ploughed he just
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	auntie
B	yeah
A	and she was the only one there
B	oh really?
A	so the guy came up to her and he says oh you're not erm
unknown_female	makes more sense so there was this guy called
B	think so yeah
A	cos there was I think it
B	yeah
A	was it something like a hundred and seventy pounds for a one-on-one lesson or something?
B	mm
A	or more than that?
B	and how much did she pay?
A	I dunno whatever it was just for to join in a lesson with other people but nobody else went so she had him to herself which she thought was was good and he says they had the
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	get to the bit where it levels out?
B	mm
A	I had to cross that
B	oh
A	so
C	how did the boys get on in their lesson? could they do it?
A	oh
B	really?
A	yeah they were bombing down
B	thing is they're fearless aren't they? they'll
A	yeah
B	just go for it
A	and they're good at all that sort of stuff
B	at that sort of age especially cos they're good at sport
unknown_female	mm
A	that's why I think they'd be better off splitting cos
C	oh
A	but
B	mm
A	at a different level to
B	yeah they'll probably spend the first couple of days together and get used to it or the first day
A	well I think you have to go in your groups and then that's
B	oh
B	oh do you?
A	isn't that normally how it works?
B	I guess so
C	yeah
A	cos last year she said or was it two years ago they went?
B	mm
B	yeah
A	so they put them in a different group and
C	it'll be fine cos she'll be with dad so
A	well that's what I was thinking
A	I I think if they go together
C	yeah yeah should be fine it's
A	cos the the boys'll miss out so much
B	yeah
A	and there's no way
C	oh no no
A	they'll just be
B	mm
A	left behind so I think the boys'll probably push for it and I'm sure
B	it depends how good the boys are
A	are you
unknown_female	yeah
B	cos if they're not they
C	but they're probably like
B	yeah they're probably alright but they're probably
C	as you say they're more fearless than anything they're probably
A	oh no well you're quite a pro after being in Japan
B	no I'm not
A	black runs
B	no thank you
A	I said to your dad we probably won't do this again he says oh we will he says we'll do this when er
B	he said
A	oh
B	I wanted to
A	I
A	we were all going it would be good wouldn't it? we must do something like that when we all go
C	shush
C	she's got a chew
A	ah oh really?
B	is she under my chair?
A	are you hungry
A	so what was the best bit of your holiday then
B	the elephants elephant riding elephant trekking
A	fancy not knowing his name I remember the camel that I went on was called Michael Jackson
B	yes
B	I remember that yeah no I can't remember his name or the mahout's name I can't remember his name either the trainer
A	what about the words you learnt which were in Thai?
B	again I can't remember any of them
A	oh
B	I'd be useless yeah I couldn't tell him to go or stop
B	or turn right or left
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he ate bananas and bamboo trees
A	yes
B	that's all they
B	that's a lot
A	yes
B	I think
A	is he?
B	thirteen stone and they eat four times him
A	crikey
C	mm?
B	the elephant ate four times
C	what? just leaves and stuff?
B	bamboo leaves
B	and then
A	yes
B	picked the hat up and put it on my head?
C	oh
A	oh no no one of you
B	no
A	feeding him
B	oh
C	oh so yeah we saw that one
B	yeah and then another one was where they put the hat on the floor and the elephant picked it up with his trunk and pops
C	ah
A	uhu
B	it was really cute
A	so where's your next trip gonna be then?
B	yeah er I dunno where I'd like to go
C	I was gonna say so were the elephants they all like meet up
A	mm
C	at this place and then they just go home with their trainers at night?
B	yeah they live it's like a big camp and
C	they all live together
B	yeah a big camp they've got all the elephants at the camp
C	okay
B	and so the trainers live with the elephants our mahout the trainer
C	mm
B	he had been with his elephant for twelve years
C	mm
B	and when the mahout was poorly he had to go to hospital for two days the our elephant ran off
C	oh really?
B	yeah and they had to get him back to the camp so that he could bring the elephant back and that's the only way the elephant would come back to camp
C	really?
B	so there's quite a strong bond there
C	mm
B	which is nice they just listen to everything that he says as well
C	yeah ah
B	but it's nice because he doesn't like there's no seats on the back of them it's just all very
A	yeah I dunno how you hold on just with that rope I'd've
B	elephants are very free which is nice
A	I'd've come off
B	you
B	yeah balance and strength really just to hold on like I say when you were going up the mountains it was fine because you just held on like that but it's when as soon as you started going forward cos you had to hold yourself back
A	well you said he was up on his hind legs to
B	yeah
A	reaching bananas from a tree at one point
B	yeah
A	and the mahout was nowhere to be found
C	crikey
B	the mahout had walked off
B	I was shouting the mahout back I was like
B	you've left your elephant here
B	come back pal
A	we're clinging on
B	yeah he just walked off and left the
B	he was the only erm mahout with a helmet on as well
B	afterwards he got he got on er off and onto his scooter so I think that's why he had the er helmet on
A	did you wear helmets when you were on that scooter?
B	yeah
A	all the time? or
B	all the time
A	just for the photo you sent me?
B	all the time hundred percent
A	is it illegal not to wear them?
B	like I said the kids were going round with them not on
A	oh
B	so
A	where did you do your jet-skiing? was that
B	mm yeah
A	I thought you'd've had your own you being a bit of a a Jet Ski pro
B	no
B	I'll never outrace him would I?
A	didn't need to race did you?
B	oh always with him yeah
B	we were going really fast
B	the other people the people that were doing it years the people that ride Jet Skis every day
A	did you fall off?
B	we were extremely close
A	do they cut out when you if you fall off? or not?
B	er
A	you're attached to it with yeah
B	that that so if
A	oh right
B	but if I fell off and
unknown_female	so close to falling off
A	dunno why you still do these things you know
B	I know it was
A	what he's like he's a maniac
B	I was just holding on by my leg at the end
B	honestly it was awful
B	it was the only thing that held on was my leg and I went crazy I started crying on the Jet Ski
B	I did
A	he doesn't learn does he your boyfriend?
B	no never will
unknown_female	he loved the Jet Skis though
A	cos I'd like to go to Canada next I told
B	are you?
A	September twenty-seventeen I'd like to do maybe four four weeks away I'll go
B	cool
A	I'd love to do that yeah
B	oh
A	to do the whale watching she's planning that and when she was telling me er I knew exactly where she was going cos I knew what the route was cos I'd looked at it
B	mm
A	a few times so
B	are we going away by the way this year with
C	yeah
A	we needed to sort out a week didn't we that you and
B	yeah are you going to Bulgaria? it's either one or the other
C	maybe
B	if you go to Bulgaria then I could come there or
C	well we might go for a week in the summer it depends on the flight prices
C	August time
A	the week here'll be cheaper if we get erm
A	one of uncle
B	where are we going?
A	I think it's
B	yeah by the sea?
A	yeah and that would be a cheap week
B	yeah
A	and you could just do and because it's a cheap week I mean you could maybe just do erm a couple of days if you didn't wanna take time off work
B	oh
A	rather than take a
B	yeah I'd have a week
A	oh it's well that's fine
B	be nice to all do a week wouldn't it?
A	but I'm thinking er or if
B	yeah
A	wanted to come down if it's there you you've got a choice of maybe obviously it'd be good if we all went for the week
B	yeah
A	but you can only book it four weeks in advance
B	yeah
A	I think I think erm
B	when do you go to Bulgaria?
A	May we're going in er June I think you'd have to be early May or
C	okay
A	cos you sometimes get the better weather there
C	yeah yeah
B	possibly May would be better for me because I have one week now that I could take between now and September so if I take it in April that means I've got May June July August
A	you've only got one week holiday in all that time?
B	mm cos I'm having two weeks in September October two weeks at the start one week in the middle two weeks at the end
A	booked already?
B	no but that's how you have to have it
A	oh
C	why? oh
B	so you have two weeks
A	oh so you can either go to Bulgaria or?
B	yes
A	right
C	two weeks er what?
B	you have to break it down to spring summer autumn and then obviously you can't have any of winter off
C	oh
B	so I was gonna have one week in the summer and then two weeks before
C	mm
B	but whenever everyone else can get it off but like I say
A	well
B	in May
A	we go away
B	early May
A	at the end of May
B	so it'd be early May
A	for ten days to Mauritius and then we're only back for a couple of weeks then we go to Bulgaria so I think in er start of May would be
B	mm
A	would be good if
B	yeah
A	your dad can get the time off erm yeah there's a Bank Holiday at the start isn't there? so
B	mm
A	we'd have to see if he's got availability so you
B	mm
A	and
C	mm
A	and then you then we when we've got a week so long as it's not in school holidays
B	so how much would it cost?
B	for a
A	to hire the whole thing
B	six bedroomed?
A	well you don't need six bedrooms do you?
B	no six people
A	yeah
B	apartment?
A	and the dog
A	cos er they went erm
C	won't be hard to
A	they took
C	let her off the lead anywhere for
C	she'll be with us so
A	didn't they with the boys and with mum and
B	are we gonna have a hot tub?
A	we'd ask him yeah
A	well yeah so it's that's gonna be nice and cheap then isn't it?
B	yeah
A	not gonna cost much to go
B	it's really good
A	probably be in three cars
B	yeah dunno if we'd get
