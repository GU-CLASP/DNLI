A	so you can replace the voice and just just say the same things
B	yeah but no the
C	no but you wouldn't be allowed to say the same things
A	yeah but you don't  you don't  own that
B	but it's
C	no
B	they're typing it up
C	yeah exactly
C	and rewrite it
A	so
C	said something to the tune of such and such
A	dunno is this er
D	straight on
A	is all your recordings gonna is er all the kinda spiel that comes out of it just gonna be um people
D	there are speed cameras down here
A	people talking about being recorded?
C	I know
D	what? Are you saying I know?
C	yeah
D	alright
C	oh right
D	a speed camera outside my house
C	yeah
D	I
C	it's there
D	I used to watch people getting caught all the time
C	I've been had by it once
A	really?
C	so never again
D	yep
C	that's
D	well not really getting
C	actually it wasn't
D	I didn't used to watch them
A	mm
D	so I just used to see the flashes
B	how often do?
D	and it would always slow down afterwards
D	wow that was
A	too late now
D	that was stupid
B	well at least it
D	you might as well just go fast now
B	do they actually have always have film in them or are they all?
D	I don't know
C	I wasn't ever
D	might just be flashing
C	got
A	these days they'll probably just be digital cameras with infinite amounts of memory
C	yeah
A	just be like upload it
C	doesn't make sense at all
D	er we're now gonna go right
C	right
D	following the other major routes
C	by the way we also have jelly babies and Tangfastics
A	and we also have some Pringles as well
D	wow
B	you're not gonna want lasagne when you get there
D	are you
A	I am washing up mostly I think
D	as in?
A	so I was like the I just sent
B	but which
D	that's crazy
A	er
D	you want to go straight on here Bean
A	I think
C	yep
D	are you alright now?
C	um
D	okay
C	yeah
C	um
D	do you want another brownie?
C	Mate can I?
A	why don't I screw them in here?
C	that's good
A	it's in there
C	wow
A	there you go
C	thank you
D	mm
A	tangfastics?
D	no I'm still on the brownie
A	no?
D	but thank you
A	you could have Tangfastics a Tangfastic brownie
D	no
B	that would be interesting
A	that'd be a bit like sparkling tea
D	oh
C	all the bubbles would go away
A	but that's something that you and
D	I forgot my railcard
A	oh
D	oh that's really annoying
A	I forgot my toothbrush
D	did you really?
A	mm
D	I think you should buy a toothbrush
A	well just go some I'll get some um you know someone's toothpaste on my finger to make a little finger rubby thing
C	A finger rub thing?
A	mm
C	that so made sense
D	well that's very annoying  that's very annoying
D	it is
C	thanks
D	makes me very grumpy
C	Will they check it?
A	there you go
D	um
C	when was the last time you've been checked?
B	I get checked every time
A	mm
C	do you?
B	but er that's just the route I use
A	so
B	not travelling at rush hour then they do tend to check
C	should be like a um a
D	A database? Where you can just
C	well yeah
D	say your name and then they could see
C	but it should also be um like a  like a  driving licence where if you get stopped you get like two weeks to show it
A	mm
C	but I don't understand why they haven't yet
D	it is a bit annoying
C	done a thing where you can just buy a train ticket online
A	mm
C	and then it just gives you like a barcode or something you can just scan your way through
B	you can buy your tickets online can't you?
A	hm
C	yeah but then you have to queue for ages anyway
D	to go and pick them up
C	to pick them up
D	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
C	Cos everyone uses the machines now
A	hm
B	or you could just have them sent to your house
D	the number of times
C	how
D	yeah but
C	really organized
D	yeah I was gonna say how how organized are you?
B	well if you want the advanced tickets that are really cheap then you do have to
D	that's true
C	which way?
A	left?
D	er left
A	so where are you railing off to?
C	mm
D	um
A	ah
D	um
A	oh okay
D	with
A	oh awesome
D	mm
A	is that along the Jurassic Coast? Or is it somewhere else?
D	dunno
B	no Jurassic Coast's a bit further that um along towards
D	I don't I haven't
B	the other side
D	Don't really know about what that is
A	a
C	yeah
D	oh really?
C	wow
B	are you doing the Seven Sisters?
D	yep
B	that's going to be quite interesting in the er if it's icy
C	Tom
B	slippage up and down
A	why?
C	Cos I just said wow
A	I've started doing? So my
A	to to to really emphasize um some sort of er what's the word? Adjective? Dunno
C	mm
A	pronoun? Adverb?
D	noun?
A	definite
A	definite article?
B	word?
A	um
A	anyway
A	so so he does that and I and I've started I'm er it's like the kind of thing where as soon as I saw it I was like I can just count the number of days before I start doing that
D	well I I do a whole load of
C	what's
D	I stand with my feet too close together
A	mhm
D	so I kind of sway on the spot
A	and bob up and down
D	I um
A	oh man
C	cool
D	I er go like that
C	do what?
D	do that quite a lot
A	mm
D	go round and round my hands
A	do you do?
D	I say things like um
A	if you haven't felt the full force of this but
D	yeah
A	can I ask you if you understood the gospel?
C	re-got the gospel
A	re-got the gospel
D	um
D	no
D	it's cos I don't understand what I'm talking about
C	do you do the
D	and down here
D	on this side there is er this and this side there is the this
C	they're very separate
D	and there's always so many lists in his talks
A	mm
D	let's just reel them off
A	oh
B	but
A	I know
D	yeah we should do
C	the
D	do they?
C	yeah
A	mm
B	the trouble is though then er you have to be really good at not laughing
C	bingo
A	at the most inappropriate point
D	I also do the thing where I ask the kids a question I occasionally find myself standing with my feet too close together and going yeah that's helpful  yeah that's helpful
D	yeah that's helpful
C	wow
D	and then I'm like what am I talking about? It's not helpful at all
D	and it's a stupid comment
A	mm
B	so
D	that's really helpful
B	you're guilty of your own er you're accusing Tom of saying
B	then you do it yourself
D	oh right so we'll try and yeah absolutely
C	yep
B	yep
C	oh yeah
B	none of us had done our assignment
B	except for
D	oh really?
D	you say I'm not doing it
A	huh?
D	I'm not doing it
D	no
D	what?
A	I said
D	left
A	how come?
D	no
C	why not?
A	yeah what's your excuse?
D	um I went to
A	made you angry?
D	yeah
A	Good one
A	I was gonna say I was a little bit worried there that you
A	like the content of it made you angry
B	did you say this tongue in cheek? Or did you say this genuinely?
D	er
B	yeah
A	why?
D	so um
A	mm
D	like I get into school and I er like my partner teacher will be like oh like so what did you do last night? Church
D	what did you do last night? Church
A	mm
B	yeah
D	um I've got to spend some time with people who are not Christians
C	yeah
A	you you guys work a bit harder because you you've got your home group and you've got um Pathfinders as well haven't you?
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	and we've got then we've got planning as well
A	yeah
A	and and it is your home group
A	um well sure you know you plan Bible studies in advance but then that only involves one person
B	do you send your Bible studies off to people to read through before you do them then?
A	I generally do to
D	mm
A	um
D	oh okay then
A	um
D	yeah
A	people just you could go I don't understand what that meant or
D	no
A	have you thought about this very important vital part aspect that you've not addressed?
D	yeah
A	mm
D	like I do think it's really good
A	mm
D	and this week I just was I just couldn't  I just couldn't  do it
A	mm
D	and I just hadn't done anything
A	mm
D	and it makes me angry
D	so I'm not completely out of it yet
A	mm
D	I do know that I need to be trained
B	but the thing is quite a lot of the stuff that they were saying we already do as Pathfinders
D	do we?
B	yeah
D	okay
A	mm
B	I mean I don't I guess it's really really helpful for like new leaders in Sunday Club
A	mm
B	but Ant and Soph kind of cover quite a lot of what we've
A	yeah
D	what we do
B	what we do
A	so what kind of stuff does it contain?
C	um
B	stuff about
C	I don't know
B	focus on the Bible
C	so yeah so the first session was all about the importance of the Bible
A	okay
D	it was all about God
A	that's the standard evangelical start isn't it
B	I don't know
D	the first session was all about God
C	the importance of the Bible
D	okay
D	well
A	and then work from there
C	it was saying it was important
A	mm
C	yeah
B	it
A	did they
B	didn't really go into it
A	wheel out the old um
C	well yeah obviously
A	everyone always wheels that
C	no
A	the scriptures for by them you hope to have eternal life but you refuse to come to
C	oh right
A	yeah?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and and so there's like a
A	mm
C	you know that you kind of show that well what what what and the answer to that question is the next few paragraphs
A	cheat
A	well
C	but then it's also sort of reflective stuff
B	yeah
C	compare Act the
A	oh man that sucks
B	it's just
C	read Psalm seventy-eight
B	that's after you've read
B	and writing lots of notes on it and and then
A	oh
B	you're like oh
C	so it's quite chunky
A	but yeah
C	yeah
A	no that sounds
D	have you met up with anyone to do it? Cos I know that um
C	yeah
A	mm
C	on this
A	mm
C	and actually we also said beforehand that it meant you know it answering those questions by yourself you're just like I don't get it
B	yes but the thing is the only time I found to do it was on a Saturday morning in bed
C	yeah
B	or over dinner
D	yeah
B	things like that
D	exactly
B	you know I er I can't spend another evening
C	yeah
C	Cos then you have to plan booking another evening don't you
B	yeah
C	and then it's
D	I know
C	uh
D	it is mental
C	but it isn't I mean if it's the is it one every half-term?
B	yeah
A	oh is it just one one
C	so it's not like it isn't
A	it's spread out
C	massive massive in terms of time
B	no but this is a particularly busy half-
A	yeah
B	no actually they're all busy
D	they're all busy
B	what are we talking about?
D	I think  I think  it's just another er for me it's just another thing
A	mm
D	um
B	and it's another thing er at a time when you feel probably if you're anything like me that
A	mm
B	church should actually be helping you say no to things by not offering you more things
D	yeah well we weren't really offered it were we
C	we were basically told
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	and
A	wow
C	that's but they're they're making it compulsory for new leaders
A	oh okay
C	although they kind you know there was that kind of assumption that we would do it
B	I E
D	yeah
D	I felt a bit like oh
A	mm
B	well
D	um
B	the trouble is if you announce it on a Friday night at like half ten
B	when everyone's just wants to go to bed
A	mm
B	you're not gonna get a positive response are you
D	yeah
A	I kind of feel though that new leaders
A	new leaders should be shipped into Twenty Twenty and then we should be moving leaders on from twenty twenty into other things
B	but it won't help you in any way for for leading for children's work cos it's just so different
A	um
B	but just doing a Bible study every so often in your home group would would manage that
A	mm
D	I I'm not I don't know what I think about Pathfinder leading now
B	mm
D	if you've just started coming to Church or you wanna get involved and you wanna get serving I think it would be a really hard place to to get serving
A	mm
D	but I think a lot of is is expected of you in terms of being able to manage to lead groups
A	mm
D	um
B	it's far more intimidating than say Scramblers
D	yeah
B	scramblers for a start they don't care about coolness or anything like that
D	but no I the Pathfinders are like
B	no they're a lovely lot
D	yeah
B	but it's just that age group plus the fact that they're at that level when they're really spiritually starting to engage
D	yeah
B	and you feel the responsibility
D	yeah
B	and you've got twice a week
D	pathfinders
A	mm
D	it's quite
B	it's quite sad that he's going to be doing it as well
A	is he? I didn't know about this
D	oh
A	taking over from
D	er so he's gonna be employed um by Church next year to be doing half admin and half running Grafted
C	really?
D	yep
B	yeah
A	wow
C	I didn't know that
D	but we lose him from and we lose him soon like we lose him
B	two weeks after half-term I think is it?
A	wow
D	yep
A	that's crazy
D	he pulled out of um
A	really?
D	pGCE
A	wow
C	I didn't know this
A	he's a man of secrets
B	well he he only announced after the PCC decided it so
A	mm
D	yeah
B	last week
D	was it last Friday? So were you guys where what were you doing last week?
A	what?
C	me and
D	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
C	so we decided to go
A	still got it
D	mm
C	you're still wearing it?
A	still wearing it man
B	has it trumped the  one?
A	er the  one actually got snipped off when I had to meet the um vice-chancellor of the university
A	I was like well I've bought a suit for this um you know
A	might as well be absolutely presentable
A	appropriate
D	so but what did you do? And where did you stay? And who else went? Were they all just super geeky?
A	there was just oh
C	er there was quite a lot of fairly geeky sci-fi people
A	yeah
C	um
A	lots of people
C	and there was like a competition for the best costume
A	mm
C	um and quite
D	did you just sit back and laugh? Or did you join in?
A	no
C	we did feel like we were more sort of looking on
D	spectators
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	visiting some strange safari
C	although we went to er you know we went to some
A	mm
C	and then they would just kind of talk to you in the  in the  meantime
D	oh no
C	like four different
D	I would hate that
C	stories
D	were they funny? Were they good stories?
A	I mean they varied
C	they were alright yeah
A	yeah
C	I wasn't really sure
A	one was absolutely horrifically pornographic
A	and it was like
D	presumably
A	I don't really wanna hear this?
D	presumably because er you wouldn't have to write well if you write in that style
C	yeah
B	mhm
C	so one of them did like er basically a kind of poem story
A	oh yeah
C	and everyone loved that er cos it was
A	mm
C	so they they just kind of wrote fairly short sort of funny
A	mm
C	funny things
A	mm
C	so that was
A	there was also a discussion on the apocalypse as well
A	there was that was er interesting
C	how do you feel about having your characters in those situations?
A	mm
C	is it hard or do you like er being evil?
D	that's just mental
A	and then there was Brian Blessed was there doing a Q and A
B	that's a bit of a fall from chancellor isn't it
A	ah
B	yeah
A	so
D	wow
C	it's a bit mad
A	but we stayed in Pontins
A	in all of the UK
A	there was no shower
D	what?
C	there was barely any hot water
A	and they didn't even have the courtesy to provide us with any soup
D	soup
C	no soup
D	I wanted soup and there was no soup
C	they um
A	damn them
C	no the the loo and the er the um
A	mm
D	yeah yeah
C	well actually no there was it was brighter than that
D	oh so there was a bath
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	okay
A	and there was
D	wow
A	no hot water so
C	and basically it the it was like they built it in the seventies and hadn't done anything since
A	mm
D	so was it just er like
A	no
D	okay
C	so it's it's like er it would've been more quality if it wasn't pre-fab
C	these little sort of flat units with sort of um upstairs or downstairs
D	wow
A	it was absolutely horrible
B	so you'll be going back?
A	no
C	if
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	um
D	so I don't really understand what it was for
A	um so there's a magazine called SFX
D	okay
A	and it deals with basically so they they they interview like actors in Dr Who or the new Star Trek or big TV series and movies and um
C	books
A	books as well
D	were they all staying in Pontin too?
A	no
A	so they had this awards ceremony and pretty much eighty percent of the awards
A	weren't collected
C	videos
A	videos in
C	but there were quite  there were quite  a few authors who were there and
A	yeah
C	various people
A	so I mean
C	if you had a VIP pass
A	mm
C	you could go and get signed get signatures
A	I mean it draws a big crowd
C	there was four thousand people there
A	yeah
D	wow
A	um
D	there you go
C	we got back in time for Church
A	mm
C	Sunday evening
D	so where was it? South Wales?
C	North Wales
D	North Wales
A	Prestatyn
C	so it was quite a way to go
A	best place in the world
C	it was just Friday evening and Saturday
D	is that I'm not exactly
D	is that past Llandudno? Or is it before Llandudno?
C	it's not far away from the border really I don't think
A	er yeah
D	okay
A	it's close to Cheshire
D	okay
A	Chester rather
D	Chester
A	so
D	it's quite a that is quite a long way though
B	how many hours was it? To
D	four hours was it?
A	really?
D	three hours
A	yeah
C	we stopped by
A	we
C	Tom's parents on the way back
A	yes
C	then my parents
D	oh did you?
C	yeah
A	that was cool
A	which was
D	that's very nice
C	it was funny really because Tom was like we could go to my my parents for a lunch
C	rang them up
C	excellent
D	let's go now
A	yeah that was awesome
A	so
C	what does that?
A	she she's going by herself to Brazil
C	really? What does fashion sister make of non-fashion sister?
A	er
A	really
D	so which one's that?
A	er that's
C	she's your older sister?
A	no she's my eldest little sister
C	oh right
A	Cos I've got two little sisters
D	really?
D	really?
A	um
D	wow
A	she kind of can cope with that and be happy
D	so how would you place yourself in and amongst them like?
A	I think so my brother my little brother
D	okay
A	um so bizarrely I probably tend towards the straight-laced sensible side of the family
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	has she got anything to do or is she just going
A	no she's doing the big um both actually
B	presumably with a tour?
A	oh yeah with a tour
B	yeah
D	it's the  it's the  kind of thing though isn't it they'll they'll pitch up and she'll meet a whole load of randoms in a hostel
A	yeah
D	and she'll figure out who's going where and she'll probably tag along with quite a few of them
A	oh yeah
D	like you do meet a whole load of random people
C	mm
D	who are travelling alone
A	yeah
D	what are your parents like then? Are they quite
A	again er cos my dad is
C	they seemed pretty cool to me
A	my dad is more like me
D	families are weird aren't they
B	oh
D	gosh that's quite sad
A	it was the
D	what the feeling is that
A	well he
D	because it's broken
A	well so he the guy was saying he was sort of so he was
D	yeah
A	a particular mistake
D	what and it just took an event?
A	yeah
D	for you to realize it
A	you know you you kind of extend that there you have to assume that everyone's family is in some way broken
B	well no family's gonna survive without work
A	no
B	but that doesn't mean every family is broken
D	I'm not sure about the word broken
B	is er
A	well okay so the the the if I try a different analogy
D	hence why you never have a perfect Church
A	yeah
D	and if you do then you must
A	completely not
D	leave cos you'll ruin it
A	mm
D	yeah
A	I was trying to explain that to er my colleague
B	have you been to a church?
A	yeah
C	it is
A	the embodied Christ
C	mm
D	I think always before I've been really annoyed when I've  when I've  seen non-Christians being really nice
A	really?
D	and I I've been like a bit like oh er that's really annoying that they're nicer than me
A	mm
D	I should be nicer cos I'm a Christian
A	mm
D	it just means you recognize that you're not nice
D	um
D	fine
A	mm
D	he was so nice
B	but do you think he was thinking it? Or
D	dunno
B	or is he not the sort of guy?
D	dunno
A	I
D	that's really nice
A	and just go oh
D	that's very much like my housemate
A	the one who needs a man?
D	yeah
A	A tall man
B	which one?
A	oh this is being recorded isn't it?
D	yeah
D	oh no
B	oh
A	oh
B	J or E?
D	I just  think
B	I don't think I've met her
D	do you've not met
B	no
D	okay
A	oh
B	but if she did you'd have to mm you'd have to leave
D	I know
D	especially not before I've rearranged the furniture
B	got any further on that?
A	send send her off er
D	yeah
D	I was like we're on the way  we're on the way  to the change around of the furniture
C	what do you wanna do?
D	so exciting Bean
D	it's so exciting
C	sorry
D	the middle room of the house um is just a corridor
C	yeah
D	round the table
D	and told
D	um
D	er
D	um
D	of every single piece of furniture in the
D	and the scale drawing of the two rooms
A	wow
D	and showed her
C	you

D	yeah
C	you're
D	this is important
C	okay
D	this is far more important
C	okay
D	anyway um I'm thinking about hospitality in my house
C	yeah yeah
D	um
D	it's very exciting
B	but
C	so
A	now you just need to put the other
D	she has to make a decision by Wednesday
A	oh okay
C	so is the front room
D	well the front room is a sitting room
B	so you're gonna put more sitting room stuff in a cold room?
D	no
B	okay
C	to the middle one?
D	and move it into the middle room
B	oh
A	what's gonna happen
D	if it was just made a bit nicer
A	what's gonna happen to the front room?
D	so the front room will then just have a dining room table in
C	but that's like who's his name chap who's the names's house
A	who's the names's house?
C	yeah
A	oh yeah
D	yeah
C	do you know where he used to live?
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	Cos they had it that
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	I think I only went in their sitting room
B	I think it
A	I can't remember
D	well
C	I'm sure I've been somewhere with you
B	of course there there was that one time that she invited everybody from church
C	oh yeah
B	and we ate in the dining room
C	yeah
D	who are you talking about?
B	invited everyone round to to
D	oh really?
D	oh really?
C	mm
D	yeah
B	Cos you had that sort of weird Quorn stuff
D	oh yeah
B	it was really nice
D	that was very
A	oh
D	that'll be fun won't it?
A	well you need to leave it longer than that cos I I will have no point of referencing
C	so do you never use the lounge?
A	I won't be able to appreciate anything
D	never use the lounge
C	and you never use the dining room?
D	no
C	for
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	you see this is the problem with the house
C	yeah
A	oh dear
D	it's taken me almost five years to realize
D	that's wrong with this
D	that furniture will be moved
A	oh
A	it's always been this way
D	what are you
D	you crazy woman
A	are you sure?
B	when
A	I think there might be a flu going round
D	yeah
B	get rid of all the photos
D	yeah
A	oh
D	yeah
C	my way is switch it around
D	and that was a rubbish idea
A	oh
A	in the kitchen from opening
D	oh that's quite annoying
A	if you open the fridge you're at risk of being bashed by someone walking in
D	so hang on are you you're not still living in
A	oh yeah
D	you did do that
C	I think that's
D	I've just realized that we shouldn't have come this way
C	is this the right way round?
D	um yeah
C	which other way?
D	and the way that I drive home to my parents which is basically where we're going isn't this way
C	I dunno
D	but never mind  but never mind
C	wow
D	yeah
C	look at that
A	wow
D	I love the enthusiasm
C	well we don't wanna give you that
A	I think we might be going that way
D	mm
C	look at all those people
C	go this way
D	oh right
B	where exactly are we going?
D	we're going round the M25
C	somewhere
D	I really shouldn't have brought you this way
C	you didn't bring us this way
D	oh okay
C	so I don't blame you
D	okay
C	then there's another secret way is there?
D	there is a secret way
C	which doesn't use any motorways?
D	which cuts off quite a large proportion of town
C	really?
D	yeah
C	how can it? This is like straight there isn't it?
D	no
C	yeah
D	so you could just cut the corner
A	oh so you
D	so you go across the A1M
C	that's not cutting a lot of corner
D	yeah it is
C	nah
D	it cuts off okay it cuts off
C	let's say instead of going like that
D	twenty-five minutes
C	you go like that
D	shut up
C	you reckon it's twenty-five minutes?
D	yeah
D	I reckon it cut you off twenty-five minutes
C	what are you saying?
D	nothing at all
C	are you saying I'm driving like an old man?
D	no
D	I'm saying you drive a lot faster than I do
D	all the time
C	this thing is um it hasn't been to a service for
C	if you're lucky
D	hurray
C	mm
D	love it
B	no it's minus five outside
D	what? It can't be
A	I'm a little bit
B	it was  it was  um
A	little bit worried about the kids
B	it was minus five a minute ago
D	was it?
B	yeah
D	wow
B	well
C	huh

A	no er I had an offer to go see my dad but I just can't
C	I'm supposed to be building three machines by the
A	yeah
C	I just said ah I'm kind of going away
B	you haven't had a holiday for all of what
C	six weeks
B	how many months?
C	yeah
C	yeah
C	seven weeks or something since
A	I need to book myself a break
A	March or something
C	I'm going
A	really?
C	yeah
C	I'll be away for
A	you're basically
C	I'll only do a month and a half work and then go away on holiday
C	and then do a month and a half
A	I know
C	come back
A	man
C	oh
D	it's freezing
D	right okay
B	mhm
D	I feel like whenever we're around they come out
C	er I don't know whether I'm away yet but yeah I probably am away June July
D	I think the jubilee's like the
C	that's the big one isn't it
D	second
C	four days
D	second week in June is it?
B	it's the fifth and the sixth isn't it?
A	hasn't she already celebrated it?
D	oh er first week in June
B	oh I don't know
D	I think that's er I think that's um the May bank holiday one isn't it? Sixth
B	fifth and the sixth and stuff like that is around Easter
D	yeah
B	April
D	no you could be right
C	A tent exhibition?
D	yeah
A	what a a bold and exciting life you live
D	can I just say it's really exciting
C	so is that they basically have a load of manufacturers that go and have different tents and you go look at this tent
D	go to the
D	and it's gonna be really exciting
B	you see that is exciting
D	I think it's gonna be really exciting
B	what's not exciting is the tent when it's up
C	like maybe like hm
B	in the rain
D	oh right
C	this is  this is  a bit like the Coleman's two thousand only they've got a zip over here instead of over there
D	no I'm gonna buy one
C	ah
D	my plan is to buy a tent big enough for four or five people
C	oh yeah
D	yeah
C	she hasn't vetoed the idea?
D	well she kind of has but I've just ignored it
D	as has mum
C	La la la
D	in fact mum  like keeps on going and telling her
D	which drives her nuts
D	um
A	just tell tell her she needs to give you enough money for a tent and furniture and then
D	so er we need to go away in my tent
C	cool
D	let's go on holiday in my tent on a bank holiday weekend
B	it's bound to rain at the bank holiday weekend though
D	no it doesn't
A	well then the
D	last time I went away it didn't rain
A	well this this is
D	yeah that is the point
C	so what what size tent are you getting?
B	I thought you pitch your tent near the pub
D	well yeah you could do that as well
C	did you?
D	on the Norfolk coast
C	cool
D	so it's not very far away
C	so you're thinking a sort of six man?
D	yeah well I
C	is that about the kind of size that you're thinking of?
D	to be honest I'm kind of thinking about a four or five man
C	yeah
D	little tent as well
C	we've got one somewhere
A	I still wanna get the um
C	and then there's two ends where you can get three people and like you get two really really comfy
D	so that's basically what I'm gonna get
A	mm
C	yeah
D	because I think that's what you need
C	yeah
D	stand up somewhere inside
C	yeah
D	lying down eating your dinner
A	oh I used to have one of those
A	well yeah
A	and just rise like Dracula
C	trodden on
D	you're like you're the hardcore one if you're doing that
C	mm
D	that's mental
A	I took I went to the end of the
A	the concert with er um the tent sort of pressed against my face
B	but what do you when that like?
D	you take those tents to um
A	mountains
D	to far away places
A	mm
D	or you're
B	but you're not extreme enough to bivouac
D	to what?
B	to bivouac
D	what's that?
B	where you sleep
D	oh yeah
D	well that'd be a bit intense
C	on Mount Everest
D	climbing Everest
C	yeah
C	like on a little ledge
C	you haven't got any space to pitch a six manner
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	yep
B	yeah base camps and things for them
A	mm
D	you just walk up don't you? And then throw yourself in an in a tent
A	yeah
B	oh I'm free
D	you're up for it as well? Awesome
B	oo
D	but
C	oo if it's in May I'll be here
D	but it's er yeah it's a bit sooner
D	want it to be quite soon
B	so that's May the seventh
C	let's have it in your garden
B	sixth fifth sixth seventh
D	yeah
C	we could do it on a non weekend non bank er holiday weekend
C	let's let's have Pathfinders
C	in the tent
A	what's the actual  what's the actual date for this?
D	so the potential date is um whenever the bank holiday is at the beginning of May
A	has that been moved?
D	I think it's the
B	it's er Monday's the seventh I think
C	oo
B	it's Easter
C	what are you doing there?
B	er teacher training
D	wow
C	is that training a teacher? Or training to be a teacher?
B	the we are
C	or what?
B	have got someone who's training all the teachers that are going to pilot the books that we're working on at the moment
C	oh
D	did you say that you knew those people that came to my school?
B	I don't think I do
D	no
A	yeah
D	May the seventh
C	May the seventh be with you
D	but I don't think the children are quite as interested
C	oh no that's the weekend of that um
B	no they're probably a bit young
C	star Wars convention
D	yeah they were a bit little
D	er
A	oh
D	I had to keep on going this is very interesting children isn't it
B	maybe year eleven
D	yeah
B	er probably
A	I love the fact that you've got a kid called John Jim
D	yeah
D	I don't know how to
D	he's a tricky little one
C	this
D	my dad told me that whenever he was driving round the M25 it always bent round in the direction that he was that it should do
C	but it should do
D	like do you know what I mean?
B	like it's always a big circle
C	this is bending clearly in the wrong direction
D	like it's always a big circle so it's always going right but just right now it's doing not that
C	yeah
D	so that was a lie
B	maybe he closed his eyes for those bits
D	I think well that's dangerous
C	I'll do that at the next bit
A	or may
A	consistently left
C	is it down the M3 we're going?
D	no
C	m1?
D	shall we um do you want to should we look at the map?
B	have a map
C	it's either the M1 or the M3
D	have you got any light?
C	or the M dunno
B	um
A	well did you have a um
D	got a?
A	address? I could put it into Google Maps
B	no
D	actually I might have a torch  I might have a torch
A	I can just put it into Google Maps
D	can you imagine me having a torch?
B	you are a proper camper
D	that is er that's amazing isn't it
C	thinking about it I'll just go over here and then I'll know cos I know where we're going
D	next time it snows we should go tobogganing
B	huh you went tobogganing?
D	yeah
B	oh
B	you went with all
D	as in
A	wow
D	so fun
C	where was that?
D	you should do that next time
C	where's the
B	on the way
D	there's like it's a proper hill
B	on the way to
D	it is a hill
B	yeah
D	it's a whole hill
B	yeah
D	it's amazing
B	I know
D	never been there
C	in
D	it doesn't work
D	my um torch doesn't work
C	mm
B	I hear that
D	yeah I've got massive bruises
B	oh
D	I've got massive bruises
A	so what's the address? We'll use the cheatingy modern technology thing
D	what address for what?
A	the place where we're going
D	I've no idea
C	dunno
D	so that's a real shame
C	it's it's called
A	yeah
C	look I just need to know whether it's the M1 or the M3
A	oh I'll just put it in
C	I think it's er down the end of the M3
D	er you're not going down the M1 and you're not going down the M3
C	where's the M3?
D	you're gonna go down when you get to the M3 you'll be able to turn the other way
C	we're going the opposite way
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	but it's still the M3
D	oh are you?
C	we need to go down to the very end of the M3
D	but the M3's not for ages and ages
C	come off at junction one and go right
D	oh right
C	so that when I get there I I
D	okay
B	Cos I'm confused
D	yeah
C	we are
B	yeah
C	going where?
D	it so we're going the other way
B	okay
D	I think we're going quite a long way to get there to be honest
C	I think we're going the only way that makes sense
B	we've got
D	yeah I've got it on my knee
A	oh there's
D	but I can't see it
A	yes I've got the location here
C	I have the correct location here
A	yeah
D	we're just  we're just  using
A	so basically you're just gonna take the
C	is it the M3?
A	no you just stay on the M25
C	the M3? Yeah?
D	I got a beam
A	go away
A	no it isn't the M3
C	argh
A	you
C	no we're not
A	yes it is
C	we're going all the way down
A	and then you turn through
C	it doesn't make any sense
A	why?
D	Tom can I have a look?
A	yeah go on
D	Cos I definitely agree with the M3 thing
A	I've only  I've only  done the postcode for the that's what Google thinks
D	yeah
A	but the M3 would be slower
D	but it's slightly slower
C	would it really be? Cos it's just bomb along the M25 and then go down the M3
A	well it's a fairly straight Roman
D	it's a fairly straight and what looks like a dual carriageway L A road
C	oh alright
C	but how else would how er other than that how else would you have done it?
A	the M3 is the other alternative
C	you'd have gone down the A1M
D	how do I get um wow hello
B	mm
D	I didn't wanna do that
A	what?
D	um
A	oh you've done the er
D	I didn't mean to
A	pointy
D	what I meant to do was what does it say for junction option two of cos it's giving you
A	oh okay
D	you went to option two would it
A	um
D	do the M3 one?
A	do route again
D	didn't like option two you see
A	well I think  I think  if we just we because we just passed the um turning for it missed the turning so but er presumably it would've been down through the dunno
D	I'm trying to remember who I got a lift down with last time
A	wow
D	four buses to get myself from this village to
B	Woah
D	for
D	the M whatever
D	a1M
D	it was ridiculous
A	we crashed
C	that's a good effort that is
A	cos you couldn't turn the couldn't use the gear because your hand was stuck in a box of Pringles
D	just shows how rubbish the bus service is though in
A	mm
D	it was appalling
B	sometimes they just don't turn up
D	thank you
B	fact that there will be a bus arriving
D	yeah
B	at this point
A	mm
B	and then the bus
B	thanks
A	you see I've always been blessed to live in places where when I used to need to use the bus they're pretty regularly it's pretty regular
D	it is amazing though that
C	mm
B	how far is it to your school?
D	mm
B	where do
D	oh
B	oh cool
D	it's really close
A	that's amazing
D	mm
A	Cos um almost
C	no need to change gear
B	I'd be I'd love to see them crack down on lights
A	mm
B	several times to make it work
D	mm
A	the thing is you just get these muppets cycling around wearing black in the dark cycling er sometimes quite fast
C	is that Hampton Court?
A	mm
C	you would've thought they wouldn't have built it so close to the motorway
C	yeah
D	poor planning
C	speaking of which
C	haribo or Pringles?
D	or a brownie?
A	brownie
C	or we could open the jelly babies if anyone's
C	feeling peckish
A	jelly babies? If anyone wants jelly babies
D	I I can
C	let's what?
D	what were you going to say?
C	yeah
D	what were you going to say?
C	I was gonna say why don't we just eat Tangfastics
A	the Tangfastics are there
C	okay
D	I might have a brownie
C	you're a jelly baby fan
D	that's what I'm gonna have
C	where's the um Tangfastics?
C	bet you're gonna give me cherry
A	I felt generous
B	are there any keys?
D	key
B	keys
A	mm?
B	the keys are my favourite
D	that reminds me of a Boyzone song
C	I might slow down
B	thanks
D	you're the key to my life
C	do what you want mate
B	that song we sang on Wednesday reminded me very much of a quite a sort of early nineties pop song
C	might stop actually
A	mm
C	I like annoying tailgaters
A	mm
D	mm
C	might just just slow down a bit
D	it was a bit slow
C	sing what?
D	how do you know that song that we did on Wednesday? Is it much faster?
D	the one we did on Wednesday
C	um
D	how do you?
C	Cos they sang it at Christchurch
D	yep
C	oh
D	the question I asked wanted to ask was like how did it go when you knew it?
C	it went like it's supposed to go I think
B	what does that?
D	what does that mean?
C	do you mean in terms of how how did we do it?
B	how fast?
D	yeah
C	um
D	what are you doing with this car? Like
C	probably about right
D	are you doing some crazy race with this guy?
C	Cos he was driving right he just zoomed up to me
A	mm
C	and drove right on my bumper
C	and then he went into that lane
C	so he couldn't go past
A	oh dear
C	uh
D	he's on his phone
D	he doesn't really care
A	yeah
C	whatever
A	but he's oh next to the white car isn't it who's er
C	I think we did it about the same kind of speed
D	oh really?
C	mm
B	I really wanna play the drums Becca
D	you wanna play the drums? You should learn
B	yeah
D	so you can go and
A	wow
D	how how would that help? So you can
B	so I can
D	drive around?
B	so I can tick off the thing that I have to do
D	oh I see
B	before I start on the thing that I want to do
A	oh I thought er that it was like to transport it
D	so how are you learning to drive? Are you having lots of lessons
B	I started some lessons
D	how's it going?
B	mm
A	cool
B	my instructor said I was  I was  quite a natural
A	you should've
D	quite a natural
B	it was quite nice
D	where did you go? Where did he take you?
B	out to
D	quite scary
B	mm
D	I remember my dad taking me round the carpark a couple of times when I first started to learn to drive
B	mm
D	no
C	oh
D	although it I think it is quite frustrating
B	oh yeah and then you have to work hard at it after that
D	kind of really fun thing and then it's quite hard work
B	mhm
D	and feel like I'm in control of the drums
A	but isn't
D	didn't sound very nice
A	but isn't that like all there is to er the trumpet?
A	once you  once you  can do a scale and then you know improvise a little bit?
D	there is something to say for technique and tone and
A	oh okay
D	and
B	but it's not an exciting instrument I'm sorry
D	the trumpet?
B	trumpet
D	well no
B	ah
D	I think it's fun then
B	I suppose
D	you do all the descants
C	why is it not an exciting instrument?
B	but there are just some instruments which you know you look at them and you think I want to play that
A	the trumpet's more of an iconic thing
D	huh?
A	was it Louis Armstrong was a trumpeter wasn't he?
D	yep
A	and that kind of stuff
C	Benny Goodman
A	Benny who?
C	Benny Goodman
A	you see there's the problem there
C	king of the clarinet
D	I don't think the clarinet is that  is that  cool and trendy
C	no
A	but it it
C	A lot of people um see it as a holder
D	and then what?
C	learn the clarinet before you learn the saxophone
D	yeah
C	but that would just confuse me because the fingering's different
D	because the fingering's different and the saxophone I think is much easier isn't it?
A	hm
D	than clarinet
C	er I dunno
A	I dunno
C	yeah
B	but if you did the soprano wouldn't it be the same?
D	no I can pretty much play the
A	mm
D	and I could play a lot of tunes on a saxophone
B	oh okay
D	I find it that much harder
C	really?
D	yeah
B	I think the clarinet suffers because of the oboe
D	do you think so?
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	and they look kind of the same so therefore
A	they must be the same
D	I think the
A	how come?
D	um
C	you don't really play jazz oboe do you
D	the jazz oboe is
C	although I'm really disappointed I have never really played jazz clarinet
D	is yet to be discovered
C	Cos that is actually quite cool
A	this could've been me
A	you know
A	I love the end of um was it Joni Mitchell's playing Real Good for Free
C	but then soprano sax is also very cool
A	so I I tried playing the sax
D	but
A	it didn't feel like it was ever gonna make a nice sound
D	but the
C	but I think partly you know
A	mm
C	you just have to
D	yeah
A	mm
C	and you can  you can  always tell someone who's better than someone else
D	I think the
C	and there's no way of skipping that out
D	the guitar as well like it's like the piano
A	mm
D	that it's like everything's there
A	mm
D	whereas with the saxophone you kind of  you kind of  need something else
C	no
A	mm
D	unless you're amazing
A	oh okay
D	and it'd be really cool
A	mm
D	and you don't need to have anything else
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	whereas with a saxophone
C	it's all about mashing two keys at once though
D	I think that's yeah I quite like that
D	it's quite fun
A	no but you know next to each other
D	yeah
C	then er even more so
D	yeah
A	oh have you seen the new OK Go er um video?
C	yes
A	that is awesome
C	I keep a very close eye now on
C	on
A	that was absolute fantastic
B	have you tried it?
C	uh?
A	sorry?
B	have you tried it?
A	no
C	have you?
B	no
A	er
C	they sort of glide
B	I haven't seen it
C	backwards and forward
A	yeah
C	so they've got six of them like three and then three
A	mm
C	and backwards
D	oh I love it
C	so as they walk on it they all kind of go wuh sort of glide around the place
A	it is  it is  really cool
C	they got kind of big for that
A	oh
C	you know where
A	oh giant Rube Goldberb machine
C	like one thing hits another thing
D	yeah
B	mm
C	and they did that in one shot but the clever thing was they the noise that the thing was making as it was running
A	mm
C	was in the tune
C	there'd be a little steel ball that went ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
D	that's really cool
C	would fit in with the music
A	mm
C	like singing the
A	song
C	melody
A	yeah
D	is that it?
A	yeah
C	it's not quite as good as I thought it was gonna be
A	no
C	it's impressive
A	it's impressive
C	but it's just
A	and when you
C	yeah
A	no
C	but
A	so there's little nails on that board
D	that's amazing
B	what's on the front?
A	um little metal things
B	that is just mad
B	that's very clever
A	it is amazingly good
B	I like that
B	that's very cool
A	so what they did with the pianos was they tuned them all to the
D	oh so then they won't
A	so that wherever they were hit they would make the right noise
B	so they're not recording it as they do it?
A	yeah they are
B	but how did they get the quality of sound then?
A	they got if you look in the car they've got loads of microphones
B	what's?
A	loads of guitars
B	that's insane
D	that's hilarious
A	I mean someone's had to tune every single one of them to be a note
B	I'm not surprised
D	Woah
B	that's thousands
A	I'm impressed that he can sing and drive
A	at the same time
C	he took stunt driving test
A	yeah
C	apparently
A	I mean that's impressive
D	yeah but that song he's been singing it for four months
A	yeah
D	he must know that song pretty well
C	did we get it?
A	mm
C	the um their other one is pretty good as well
A	oh yeah
B	so are they quite big then?
A	yeah
C	for their videos
A	Don't know really
B	but you don't make any money out of videos
A	um
C	but I guess a lot of people saw it and went ah that was quite
A	yeah
B	no
A	so
C	she made money out of that?
A	yeah
C	really?
A	so not much you know compared to the amount of abuse she got but
C	well thirty thousand pounds is pretty good
A	yeah I know but
D	well
A	it was a birthday present
D	so what was it?
A	so basically I think some rich parents bought their er um daughter I think I dunno if they were rich but basically some parents bought their daughter like a day in the recording studio
C	it's absolutely terrible
D	I
A	yeah it
D	I wonder if I saw it
C	people are always
A	it's really  it's really  big
D	okay
A	so it's just a real real shame
C	and it was fairly terrible
A	this is the er  version
C	did you see the colossal  did you see the colossal   page turner machine?
A	what's that?
C	page turner machine
A	no
C	did you see that? Oh it's hilarious
A	think this is it anyway
C	do they cheat? It's not all the sounds? No?
A	yeah
C	it's all timed to with the thing
C	wicked
A	they must just have so much fun just thinking up all of these things
C	they actually filmed it in one shot
A	mm
B	how many times they must have set all that
A	yeah
B	up though
C	just goes on for so long
C	that's that was very good
D	that's crazy
A	dunno
C	um which junction are we getting off? Thirteen?
D	yeah
A	um
D	unless you wanna do the M3
C	no
A	apparently it took several months

B	I'm alright in my walking boots
A	sorry?
D	sorry?

D	yeah I put my walking boots on
D	weird
B	but cold air sinks
D	yeah
A	are we there yet?
C	should've thought about getting walking boots really
A	mm
C	yeah
D	kind of assuming the girls won't wanna run around in the mud
B	well it's a
C	I'm in the kitchen all the time and actually the um you know you get lots of water spilt on
B	actually
C	having waterproof er shoes is quite nice
B	I forgot my running trousers so I can't run round in the mud anyway
C	did you see those um snowflakes
B	and I'm doing craft so
A	oh yeah
D	you'll be fine
A	I quite like the um metal animals as well
C	yeah

D	how many leaders?
C	I haven't really done much
B	how many leaders to your?
C	um
D	I'm really looking forward to my bed

B	Cos it's not my bed
D	that's true
C	it's the wrong bed
D	but I really am looking forward to some sleep
B	it's a very happy hum
D	that's weird
D	I wonder if I do it regularly
A	nice
D	apparently I didn't do it the next night
B	no
D	so
A	I'm now being followed by someone on Twitter whose
D	I dunno
A	profile name is zenofhate
B	what sort of people do you attract?
C	so where are we going?
A	er
C	Down the A30?
A	keep going

D	or three
B	not like camps then
A	take us to
D	I think you'll be in with the um you know
B	no I didn't
A	so basically
A	basically
B	oh okay
A	just stay on this
D	um
A	all the way
A	until the roundabout
D	so I don't think that
C	that's not
D	but I think
C	I thought the roundabout was the junction with the M3
D	you'll be with all the girlies
A	er yes
D	you might be
C	oh right
D	Cos I was last year and the year before
B	with all the kids?
D	yeah
B	okay
D	in their building
B	right
D	there's lots of different buildings
B	no
D	so there's lots of little random buildings that you have to walk in between
D	end of the building
B	okay
D	to the right
B	oh
B	one of the things I have a
B	you know seven other leaders
A	you should manage the boys
B	insane
A	that doesn't happen
D	she's not a boy
C	you didn't like sleeping with other people in the room?
B	I didn't like sleeping with so many
C	oo
B	I'm quite an early
C	where are we?
B	I like to go go to bed before midnight
C	have we gone the wrong way?
A	mm
C	I sense the wrong way
D	yeah
B	you feel like you know
A	it felt wrong
B	it's being
C	definitely since we're now going thirty miles an hour
A	yeah
C	right?
A	and then for your um er so Stanwell Road
C	whether I can or cannot do it
D	just do it anyway
A	you know
D	just drive on down
A	there we go
C	are we  are we  doing a U-ey like that? Would that be better? If we did a complete U-turn?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it doesn't look like you can go anywhere with this anyway
C	turning around
A	this is just a complete
D	let's not go into that place
A	U-ey place
D	yeah
C	everyone loves turning around
B	we had to do it once didn't we
A	that's what repentance is
C	actually deliberate there
D	I think that's probably something to say to
B	is it really selfish?
D	um
C	yeah
D	not if it  not if it  causes you that like if it's  if it's  a real stress
C	no
D	for you then I think
A	mm
B	it's just I was so tired by Saturday
D	yeah
A	mm
D	so I think that's the kind of thing you just need to say to
A	mm
D	I think that's definitely a worthwhile thing to
A	mm big
D	I'm not
B	everyone says it was a really tough camp
A	mm
C	where are we going?
A	left
B	is that
D	I
B	are they just saying that to to try and convince people to come back?
D	dunno
C	wait
A	we're going down the
D	A
A	we're going down the A308
D	oh right
A	a308 to
D	that sounds good
C	I think as an observer um it did seem like you had worst behaved kids than usual
D	we
B	she could be like there were times when she just wouldn't do what she was told
A	oh is she the one with
D	Down's
A	Down's syndrome?
B	yeah
D	Down's
A	so you probably  you probably  need to
D	she
A	to cope with her
D	yeah
A	mm
B	but
C	didn't she? More or less?
B	she did
C	Cos you had
D	well between us
C	four of you
A	but even then if you've got one to oner like you you want the one to oner still needs a rest at some point
B	yeah
D	she was
B	know that before like the the day you come on camp
A	mm
B	and then you find out
A	yeah
B	I I could
D	she was quite she was very exhausting
A	mm
B	the thing that got me was the fact that she got so distressed when people didn't explain things to her
A	mm
B	and
D	yeah
A	so
B	do you think she's coming back?
D	I doubt it
D	she might do
B	do you  do you  know where we are?
D	this looks familiar
C	yeah
D	so
B	watching Casablanca
B	well last night he was saying Casablanca wasn't he
C	um
B	or was it he wasn't quite sure of it?
C	movie to watch?
A	well I think he's got it
A	would be a bit of a shame to waste Casablanca on the kids
C	waste
A	it's true
D	yeah
A	you know
B	to be honest there aren't many really classic classic films that I enjoy
D	um
A	mm
B	mm
D	watching a film
B	so we didn't have like all the fun stuff like cushions and stuff
D	yeah
B	er but
C	cool
D	I'd never seen anything cos I never really watched any films when I was little
D	oh I'm watching a film
B	there weren't very many this time cos it's half-term
D	mm
A	that was
B	you ought to be a tour guide
D	you turn right somewhere here don't you
A	yeah
C	this place is really nice when it's sunny
D	have you been here when it's sunny?
D	oh right
C	I'm just quoting you
D	oh right
A	so let's party dot co dot UK
D	I think it's a not that nice place
A	let's have a er party
C	that black dog really looks like the black dog that people were thinking of when they named that pub
A	mm
D	what do you think
C	I dunno
B	cheapest pub in
A	cheapest that I know yeah
B	mm
A	Carling
D	no one?
A	sorry?
D	no one?
A	yeah well
B	but wasn't it also the fact that they were the er someone said recently um maybe in a sermon that they it was because they were all sort of sharing er sharing their lives with one another because the
A	yeah
B	welsh valleys are
C	yeah
A	was it
B	or it could've been at new wine
A	oh yeah
C	oh yeah
A	could've been at new wine
B	true
C	that says Sunbury that way
A	oh my Google Maps has just crashed
C	given that we're going to Sunbury Court
A	where is the?
C	somewhere nearby
A	is that the junction with the? Duh duh duh
C	and turn around?
A	no
D	mm
A	okay
D	I was gonna say
A	yeah
A	well it's the next one within the avenue
C	mm
A	so can I either turn around?
C	wow I actually got it into reverse
A	you can actually
C	this is a real turn around
A	you can  you can
C	really?
A	yeah
C	why don't I go left and go back that way?
A	um
C	or is it worse?
A	it's well the left is a  is a  bigger road
C	I like that
A	so
C	let's go that way
A	so are you taking the first exit and then go back? Then all the way down until you hit the river
C	yeah
A	but no going back to the thing about what's he was saying about that
C	dink
A	would the lessons  would the lessons  of the Welsh revival lead us to um preach proclaim the gospel outside The Regal on a Friday night? I mean you'd certainly get beaten up doing that
B	the the the fact that you get beaten up doesn't make the gospel any you know
B	Don't know
C	buy them a pint
A	yeah
C	double check
C	mm
D	Don't recognize this at all
A	but then left
D	there'll be what?
D	oh yeah
A	so
D	this looks more familiar
A	I had to do that last time
B	even though it's so cold?
D	no because
A	oh okay
D	quarter to eight isn't bad
A	no
A	just took the wrong turning
