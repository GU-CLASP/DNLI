A	I say codify it is that you can find out how many times somebody goes er you know and
B	okay yeah
A	what they've found out so far from the data collection is that this amazing has been replaced with the word awesome
B	yeah
A	so everyone says awesome awesome awesome
B	yeah yeah I noticed that it's horrible
A	all the time
B	it's horrible yeah not any
A	but it used to be amazing amazing and it used and then it used to be wicked wicked wicked
B	yep
A	and now its awesome awesome awesome
B	as if you're in America
A	yeah I actually thought awesome was quite English
B	totally awesome see they have another
A	right totally awesome yeah
B	and two more comes from you
B	that's going to skew it a little but
A	it will do yeah
C	is something wrong?
A	no I'm just testing him
B	one one wicked and five fucking awesomes six sorry
B	ticks like
A	yeah and they can they can codify that too how many times I swear
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	anyway here we go cheers
C	alright cheers
B	mm
A	chin chin
C	nice to go to a good film that we could actually all sit through
B	yeah yeah
A	and not complain
B	did you cry in the end?
A	no
B	okay that's unusual
A	no
B	you have a very low crying threshold normally
A	yeah but I've had some
C	it wasn't a cryable film though
B	yeah
C	didn't think there wasn't a lot of emotion in it
C	no
A	I kind of knew she wasn't
A	yeah that was so undramatic
B	I thought it was
A	I loved it
B	I thought it was quite fun though
C	it was fun but it was actually well done
A	yeah
C	he's just like I've had enough I'm gonna jump out the window
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	it was brilliant actually the way it was done
B	yeah
A	I liked it but no I found I mean I found that yeah she wasn't I didn't think for one moment she was actually going to become a nun
B	yeah
A	so that was the thing is that I thought oh she's just going to have to
B	she's far too pretty to become a nun
B	yeah
A	she could have just moved into the aunt's place
B	yeah
A	and become some sort of you know
C	of course she could have just lived her life
A	but the but god won through
B	yeah
C	she just wanted to come out for a peek before she kind of signed up
A	well I think it was I think if that is if that's true that's a good idea that if you're if you're brought up in a in you know
C	it's a test
A	that they actually
B	oh and she
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah that's right mm
A	but the fact is they say to them you can go away and come back
B	yeah
A	you need to go and test yourself before you really take your vows I think that's a great idea
B	yeah of course
A	I didn't really know that they did that
B	I mean I really I really liked the photography in that
A	yeah
C	mm
B	because it was just it was really nice
A	mm
B	and they taped over the slightly
A	yeah
B	yeah you were just like sit there and you know chill
A	yeah they're quite nice stills actually when we came out there was like three really nice stills from the film
B	yes yes
A	you were saying that one under the arches when they were the jazz erm player
C	yeah when she was talking with the jazz player yeah mm mm and they put some nice jazz into it and carried a good story
A	funny that they had to put the subtitles up at the top
B	yeah
C	I thought that was that was just it was
B	I thought it was even better if er once they drove back to
A	yeah that would be funny
B	no I mean this was like what like nineteen seventies nineteen eighties er Poland
A	ah even when I was there when I was driving on their well their main roads not the motorways well kind of like a motorway it's a main road
B	yeah
A	and erm you know there'd there'd be one lane and there would be four different sets of traffic in your lane
B	yeah
A	and you'd be overtaking some slow car and the slow car was
B	yeah mm
A	and then you'd have BMWs and Mercedes
B	yeah
A	overtaking my car which would I had a hire car I can't remember what it was
B	yeah
A	just like four sets of traffic overtaking each other in one lane
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you'd find that the erm the ruts
B	mm mm
A	in the roads were so bad
B	yeah
A	that it's uncomfortable driving unless you know you're driving off the ruts but driving in the ruts is it's just
B	yeah yeah my parents were there in eighty-five I think cos my father is from erm
A	your dad?
B	yeah well he he can't remember it he was like three years old when when when they fled but er cos they the Russians were coming
A	yeah
B	but some of the his relatives stayed there erm er but they didn't get much er contact with them only sort of occasionally sort of letter and they were still speaking German there but they're and they several of them came to my grandparents' golden wedding anniversary er but not as a couple although the children had to stay behind to make sure that they go back
B	I I'm not kidding you
A	yeah yeah no I know I know but they do they have to use them as collateral yeah
B	yeah so
A	but its it's yeah it's funny that that's the way it's done so
B	so and then my parents and my uncle went there a couple of times
A	yeah
B	er and
A	yeah wow
B	and er I'm not sure they still have photos from there was I remember seeing the photos and it was very much like like the film
A	like that yeah yeah yeah some of the hotels I went to
B	and when I went in eighty-nine it was still very much like that
A	yeah like that hotel they were staying in just not that dissimilar from the hotel I stayed in
B	oh no we stayed in really nice hotel but I mean we had er German Marks right so er the hotel we stayed in in er in
A	yeah yeah
B	mm got a couple of bottles of vodka for er for fifty P and er
C	yeah and you'd be away
B	yeah
C	and that's it a couple of bottles of vodka and cigarettes were a quarter of the price of the bottle of vodka
A	two great cities
B	I know we went into bars and we went to like a really nice restaurant I think we paid like one Mark
A	really?
B	and the the toilet lady because I the toilet lady you had to give them a tip and none of us had had
B	it was
C	wow
B	pretty pretty extreme
A	yes yeah so erm but the Poles whocame here but then they went back is that is that what happened?
B	sorry?
A	the Poles who came over to England
B	yeah yeah
A	were thinking that they were going to find what a job paradise are then
A	and then and then er apparently they they just thought it was shit and they've moved back
B	yeah a lot of them moved back yeah
C	but what's the real reason do you think? it's just that the economy got better in Poland?
B	yeah mm and when they had an opportunity here they earned some money they were working quite hard and
C	they got what they needed and went home
B	I mean Poland isn't Poland isn't a a bad place to live either so
A	yeah yeah
C	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I suppose they have you know enough money to like build a house or whatever so
A	yeah
C	has the erm has the economy kind of European economy changed so it's that a lot of work gets outsourced to Poland or?
B	dunno
C	I've heard of it kind of being like Romania and Bulgaria and that kind of thing no?
B	no and it it's not
C	it's not something you've heard of
B	it's not really
C	what I know is that some
B	er I mean it I mean it's A a very large country so it's it's I think the second largest in area size after
C	Germany
B	er France
C	after France okay
B	yeah er but it's agriculturally it's bigger than France and France is is actually a very agricultural country
C	yes mm
B	er but you know I think in the cities there are jobs and stuff so we
B	they're they're not like a you know so it's not like sort of I don't think Poland ever was a a sort of a er a cheap labour kind of country unlike erm
C	Romania or Bulgaria or somewhere like that
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	okay
B	so
C	but it but I've heard that there's
B	because they were always they were always quite you know civilised well well-educated and er so yeah
C	no yeah of course of course erm
B	and relatively rich compared to say Bulgaria or Hungaria like even in in er in Soviet times
C	so there's a big scale difference even in in between those countries?
B	yeah I mean in in Poland okay you had to queue I mean when my parents were there which was before the with with you had to sometimes you had to queue for like three hours to get a loaf of bread or something like that right?
A	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	er coffee was er impossible to get so we always had the parcels with coffee and shit like that
A	yeah wow
B	but they used it to trade right? and well overall they were you know not too too too bad off I I I think they probably managed the transition reasonably well as well so
A	well my erm well my business partner
B	we I think in sort of er in the in the Soviet
A	yeah
B	and and Poland probably wasn't too far well Poland was a bit off from it but well
A	mm
B	yeah well I mean I looked through through the list and I thought you're more likely to come to
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	er so I looked at it I said is that it? erm eh
A	I know I mean Friday there's nothing on apart from some sort of opera or something
B	yeah and then there was er
A	yeah I'm not sure
C	yeah I've seen a poster for that
A	I'm not so into that idea
B	yeah yeah and er
A	it's a bit weird
B	it was quite funny when I was standing outside having a fag there was like there was this group of Asian people there
A	yeah
B	Asian students they were looking and they were considering I think going to watch Tony Benn because they didn't know what it was
B	I thought that was quite amusing
C	let's go and see Tony Benn
A	yeah they'd probably last about ten minutes and walk out
C	that is brilliant
B	yeah they were very indecisive so one of them went in and I think sort of looked and
A	it's like
C	mm
A	well at the weekend we were getting into erm the
B	okay yeah
A	and erm it's the
B	I vaguely recall hearing something about it but I don't know
A	yeah it's you know it's
B	okay
A	and it was made quite a long time ago
B	yeah
A	erm and we just love this character in it
B	yeah
A	and he happens to be a
B	okay
A	his character is really quite amusing
B	what are
A	so they
C	it was Kim MacClean and Donald
A	not it's Donald MacClean
C	Donald McClean and Kim
A	Pirus Pireus or something
C	can't remember but they they were erm the two films are actually linked
B	mm
C	the
B	yeah
C	and the er Blunt one was when post-war post the Second World War
B	okay
C	and they were all communist
B	okay
C	and it turned out the Blunt erm Blunt was a politician is that right?
A	mm
C	Blunt was a politician that was called he was called out by Margaret Thatcher in the seventies as being a communist spy in the war
A	no he wasn't a politician he was the the the the royal family's erm top bloke to look after their entire private collection in the UK
C	he looked after the
B	okay
A	of that of that
B	yeah
A	so he was put in power
B	but the other guys became spies within erm MI5 and MI6
B	oh okay
C	so they were spies within the spy agency for Britain
B	yeah yeah
C	but they were actually erm reporting to to Moscow
B	ah so they were double agents
A	yeah
C	then this this this yeah this all started when they all met at
B	okay
C	in the nineteen thirties
B	oh
C	and erm and and they kind of followed the whole war and then they felt erm betrayed because Russia aligned with Hitler and all of this kind of stuff erm
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	there's this one guy the character this guy Burgess and he's really the kind of erm you know he's the he's the the outrageous queer of the time right? but he's got very important he has important positions he's an alcoholic he's just way off you know way out of it and erm they there's two two of them get sent to America to do some important jobs you know when they were British erm but of course they are still spies you know in their positions and erm
C	yeah the official
A	erm and but it was really a cottage you know that you know and and anyway he managed to sort of somehow get himself erm off that charge
C	yeah
A	but the wink and the nod was the judge knew someone who he went to Eton with he went to
C	yeah the enigma code
A	and they kept on the other one and they they kept the one that was harder than the enigma I forgot what it was called now but they were breaking this code and it took ages for them to break cos it was just so hard and even after the Cold War finished they kept on trying to keep cracking this code because they thought it would be useful to actually have the whole picture in case they ever needed it for whatever reason and erm so they kept everyone there and they were they actually used it in a way was to get the the the names of these spies because they through the code they were cracking the code they began to realise that these spies were implying an elite status positions in England
B	okay
A	and they were English
B	yeah
A	and that's in the end they got them because they got Anthony Blunt because they kept on cracking the code and they found out that it was this you know royal family friend
B	yeah
A	and that's when Thatcher came down hard on him and he was saying oh look cos he'd been he's gone away to to Russia and he was exiled in Russia and and he apparently wrote this letter to Margaret Thatcher it's quite famous saying dear dear Margaret
A	or whichever one and then you can have me you know like you can handcuff me and erm and she just wrote back and said no you're not even coming back to England you're staying in Russia you made your bed and you should lie on it
C	but the but the guy we couldn't remember his name of the I mean he got buried with honours in Moscow
B	okay
C	and all this kind of thing so they
A	but the Anthony Hopkins guy
C	really pretty outrageous
B	yeah
A	just Anthony Hopkins playing this eccentric queer sort of you know just
B	yeah
A	erudite as well to the
C	gentleman
A	he's just so funny in this role it obviously he's not meant to be funny it's just the way it comes across but
C	yeah he's got that classic line yeah? so he he has a whole night out he's absolutely hungover and he wakes up the morning and his mate's hanging out trying to talk to him and here he is just knocking back the leftovers in glasses
A	drinks
C	you know wine and all this kind of thing right? he grabs this bottle of wine that's half opened and he's trying to finish it off in the morning and his friend goes you've just gotta stop drinking and he goes er I kind of like my wine slightly over oxidised
A	yes no well oxidised
C	well oxidised well oxidised
A	he's just knocked it back
C	yeah
A	brilliant he's really good it it he's really funny but then we saw
B	oh no I've seen that on the on the programme guide there was something called
A	yeah
B	I watched something else
C	what was it about?
A	it was all about this vicar from in
B	that sounds that sounds exciting
A	I know and the only good thing about it is that he's a really good looking actor that's the only reason
B	not not that I care
A	no exactly and he you know it's really quite a dull it's a dull it's a dull drama
B	yeah yeah
A	but I mean
B	yeah
A	because they're using obviously all of the
B	yeah
A	all of the locations in
B	yeah
A	erm it's really great how they how they how they can get that look you know this period kind of look and I keep going round
B	they can probably do that in Photoshop
B	yeah mm mm
C	the the imagery in it is really well put together
A	mm yeah it's it's quite interesting except there must be this thing about being back in
B	yeah
C	we're a bit more observant than the than than than the local er
B	there was a thing on wasn't there wasn't there some like stupid film about er you know the national poet or something like that who?
A	recently?
B	no five six years ago and he was there's a whole bunch of er big shots which er which because he he came he also went to
A	oh it's amazing ah yeah
B	it might have been part of the sort of
C	oh the Rupert Brooke and and
B	yeah yeah
C	Virginia Woolf and
B	I don't know
A	I'm trying to think what that film was cos normally I can kind of remember films I've seen but that doesn't ring a bell at all he's a poet laureate?
B	sorry?
A	he was a poet laureate?
B	yeah something like that but then there was he he might have had to resign because either he was gay or he had an affair with someone else or something like that there was a
C	or he or he got jailed
A	sounds quite good
B	no I think I like very hazy recollection I didn't like the movie at all because it was like all a bit er
C	you're not you're not talking about Archer are you?
A	A bit too
B	no no no no no no
A	they might have gone up to them and said can we use your house as a as for this
B	no it was definitely sort of a feature film erm
C	oh okay
B	and I didn't yeah it was like basically almost all of these sort of okay it wasn't like a a period drama as like two of them were advertised which I hate with a passion I I can't not even with a passion I just can't be bothered
A	yeah fair enough yeah
B	er but it sort of like a more sort of nineteen twenties nineteen thirties kind of period thingy and it was just like or maybe a little bit later actually so
C	well that's interesting
A	oh I think I think mm
B	I I I that's all I remember from it
A	because we did see a Bertrand Russell film
B	uhu
A	I don't remember him being a poet laureate he was like a you know a groundbreaking mathematician
B	no no this was about a poet
A	oh right okay a sort of lovey-dovey kind of
C	not that erm what did she
A	romanticy
B	yeah with a with a little bit of drama
C	yeah but that wasn't a
A	don't know if you do say poet as a
C	poette?
A	no I think you just say poet don't you?
C	you know the er
A	she played a poet?
C	yeah
B	maybe it was that film
C	an American
B	has a maybe it was that film then
C	she's an American poet
B	but did they appear in
C	I don't think so
B	okay
C	no well actually I could be right you could be right could be could have been in
A	oh but Gwyneth Paltrow was erm she played er Sylvia Plath
B	huh?
C	who's it yes that's it Plath
A	Sylvia Plath
C	Plath Plath
A	Plath Sylvia
B	Sylvia
C	Sylvia
B	Plath
C	yeah aunty Sylvia
A	who was erm Craigs Daniel Daniel Craigs was in it as her abusive husband
B	okay
A	who was also a famous poet erm forgotten who he was now he was erm
B	yeah maybe that was it yeah but that
A	yes you're right it did it did
C	you could well be right there you go
A	at the beginning it did
B	yeah yeah
A	before they moved to the cottage in
C	so you're quite a cultured animal aren't you?
B	yeah yeah I didn't like the film at all it was like too much sort of
A	oh maybe it's not this film then because that film was a bit it it
B	yeah I know it went quite dark but it was like
A	oh quite dark yeah
B	there was a
A	it started out quite lighthearted
B	yeah but exactly the sort of usual shots from the colleges and all that crap
A	yeah yeah yeah they met here they met here yeah they met
B	yeah
A	so it was Sylvia Plath and erm
C	John Grisham
B	see when I when I see when I sat in a
A	what have you started
C	Arthur Conan Doyle
B	when I when I said er it was a bit er one of these films that Gwyneth Paltrow would play in I didn't actually think she was in there but
A	stop
B	but no you're right
C	yeah yeah there we go we've hit the nail on the head
B	and you started it because you started talking about
C	crikey see we actually dragged something about of
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah oh yeah I'm sure it's deep
A	I thought you were going to become a member of the
B	er this was only the second film since you came back so
C	there you go
A	oh I see so you don't really trust
B	see whether you had any nay
A	you don't trust it yet
B	perseverance of actually going to the cinema whether it's worth
C	once once we've got a track record
B	what about third time lucky that you might contemplate I mean look
C	she just signed up today
A	okay
C	yeah
A	so we could make a bit of a
C	yeah she's
A	no I think she probably thinks that me and her might go and see some films together
C	oh okay
A	whereas
B	okay if you have a
A	yes I thought I'd go for a change of gender this time
C	shocking
A	we can go and see some chick flicks instead
B	yeah
A	Effie Gray and all that
C	Effie Gray yeah
B	Emma Thompson is in a lot of these shitty films isn't she?
A	she was in one with erm a
C	she was in The Fly
B	no but she she did a lot of the all all the Bronte and
A	she does these dramas
C	oh she's done yeah yeah yeah
A	and and all the whatever the other name the the other er
C	but it's kind of standard fair for British
B	but what is the there's like one not not Bronte but there's this one
B	er Mr Mr Darcy
A	yeah Pride and Prejudice
B	fucking hell
A	yeah
C	oh Mr Darcy fuck off
A	I think that's what
B	I've I've actually never seen it but I've seen that scene er it's just and she wrote lots of books like that with all
A	the the one in there we just saw Effie Gray
C	Effie Gray?
B	no no the
A	Pride and Prejudice
A	yeah
B	er there's a there's a book which is called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
A	yeah I've seen that
B	which apparently if you know Pride and Prejudice which I don't is actually really funny
A	yeah
B	because it's mostly Pride and Prejudice word for word and then there are zombies
A	just zombies
B	er er stitched into the into the fabric of the story
B	but it means that in order to read it you have to read at least two-thirds of Pride and Prejudice because it's about two-thirds Pride and Prejudice and a third zombie
C	and a and a third zombie yeah
B	yeah so
A	so you've got to really want to read it
C	mm okay
B	yeah it would have to be bloody good zombies
C	to to get to that part
B	to er
C	oh right okay? yeah it didn't sell it for you?
B	no
C	no
A	no no
B	anyway do you want another drink?
C	yeah I'm not too sure about this Beck's stuff though
B	yeah that's the only lager they have but
C	mm
A	oh my god
C	okay
