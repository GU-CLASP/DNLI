A	mm
C	that's
B	mm
C	how long's that taken?
B	all day
C	had you going an hour
C	just taken a hundred pounds to make it
C	well two people
B	plus material
C	yeah
A	hour are you charging?
C	well I'm supposed to when you're designing in two thousand and eleven was thirty-seven pounds for designing logos you see
A	oh
C	I mean I don't
B	that's two thousand and eleven
A	mm
C	mm
B	that's over four years ago
C	I had another chat with erm the chap at
B	mm
C	er rubbish computer have to
B	is he?
A	oh
C	but he said cor thinking about all those days what it was like and we put there were the trouble is sign makers give a price for the job and if you end up doing more work on the artwork that's part of the sign
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	if you're a designer
B	oh yeah
C	you charge for every hour you spend
B	yeah
C	doing it
A	but you are kind of a designer aren't you?
C	but people don't expect it they want a sign and and you give them a price at the beginning
A	yeah but if they gave you a sheet of paper saying this is what I want on my sign and it's this dimensions and you do it like that
C	mm
A	that's
C	well
A	designing isn't it?
C	no I I generally suggest things and they go along with it
B	but
A	so it's your fault
C	need to say that's
B	does that cost them more then when you suggest that then?
C	no I'm generally suggesting keep it simple
A	mm
C	don't add too much get them to look at your website everything'll be in the website
A	mm
C	on the board so they can't read anything
B	no
A	yeah
C	and erm there was one guy just done one for
A	yeah
B	yeah and it does yeah
C	so leave that line out then you've got more space for to make things bigger
A	mm
C	for what you're saying
A	yeah and not be
B	yeah
A	repetitive yeah
C	and he's followed that advice and now I've managed to get a huge logo
A	mm
C	about two foot high is
B	yeah
C	the logo
B	oh
C	I've never ever put punctuation marks on a sign but he wanted it and he's happy now he's got it so
B	oh
C	he wants it and then
A	mm
C	then it then it says underneath
B	oh right
C	erm and and a very light grey that says since the date at at the bottom established so and so at the bottom and the
B	mm
C	and
A	yeah
C	looks really nice and then I've sent it back on Saturday and this morning he sent me an email from his Ipad erm saying
A	ah
C	so he wants four
B	four? wonderful
C	cos they got I hope he doesn't think
B	well are you
C	that they throw
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	but I think he thinks that they're just disposable
B	mm
C	some of these events he can leave up or something
B	mm
A	mm
C	but they are about a hundred quid each perhaps I should I be fair to him and or just do what he says?
B	do you get anything through your website?
C	not really I I get most of my work through
A	mm
C	but at the wrong time I don't want
B	yeah
C	any more than the show
A	yeah
B	you're still
C	one page nothing else yeah on the website
B	what's it called?
B	dot co dot uk okay
C	still there it's one page
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well then that'll be
C	so all his plant stuff all of his plant stuff he's got
A	what's the
C	a hundred and sixty-two bits of equipment
A	I need the
C	that could go up that's ridiculous
B	yeah
C	and all of them he wants branded now and he also wants stickers he can slap
A	yeah
C	loads of work
B	yeah
C	and there's that and then there's
B	take them down
C	I might
B	and chuck them away
C	I don't know so I've got two more ones for that erm
B	well it's
C	what have I got? then I've got
B	it's a lot of work
A	mm
C	a huge one which is difficult and I've told him we've missed the opportunity when I hit the
B	oh right
C	and I've got to turn the whole board pink
B	pink?
C	but I might ask you
B	yeah?
C	I did a design which I thought was lovely and his his son has changed it which is horrible but that's what he wants that's what he'll get
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	or you could say
C	I had less on it with but bigger now he's got more on it smaller and because he's put so much in
B	yeah
C	and I designed it so that only one bit had to join up to make it look right a big swirly bit you see on the join that
B	yeah
C	so the join had nothing else but the way he's done it there's about five or six different lines got to join up and that's asking for trouble
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	so I'll do the middle bit and he'll have to put the two little triangles on the corners
A	mm
C	and then I told him I said I'm sorry we we
B	mm
C	my fast first draft I could have done it then
A	yeah
C	it was all flowing in for the
B	mm
C	I had to write and say I'm sorry we've missed the window of opportunity
A	yeah
C	and and you know I'm I'm fully committed to the
B	so what he is he getting someone
C	he hasn't come
B	else is he?
C	he hasn't come back yet
B	no
C	I like
B	you don't want to upset anyone
A	yeah
B	do you?
C	no
A	mm
C	so that so it's already queuing up for afterwards
A	mm
C	mm
B	what's that fallen down
C	mm?
A	oh yeah it does look like it yeah
B	it's coming out of the ceiling look
A	mm
C	what?
B	the vent
C	oh yes it has dropped
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	I had an idea
A	oh dear
C	look my
B	yeah it does
C	cos it's facing south
B	yeah
C	now if I build a box
B	yeah it could do yeah yeah
A	mm
C	and all it will cos to run is a little fan
A	mm
C	that would put a whole hairdryer up there couldn't I? tape that on and
A	you ought to get your loft insulated don't you?
C	no well that's the problem the loft is insulated so none of the heat in the loft goes down through the ceiling
A	oh I see
C	that's you see you insulate
A	I thought you said it wasn't
C	this loft and it's the one place that warms up in the winter
B	yeah
C	and you're not using the heat
B	no
C	am I on a winner? could be this could be a marketing thing
C	so you have a box
A	mm
C	that is stuck is right up sealed up to underneath your felt
B	mm
C	and all you've got to do is then is pump it down into the roof
B	yeah
A	mm
C	er but you're wasting all that because you insulate the wrong bit if you insulated
A	yeah
C	insulate under the tiles you're not gonna get the heat in either
B	no no
C	but you insulate all the pipes and
A	mm
C	on the floor of the loft but got this lovely warm air air up there that's not going anywhere
B	that's true
A	yeah
B	that's why we had the doors to the conservatory
C	mm
B	open
C	mm
A	mm
B	cos that actually heat the house up
C	mm
B	I get too hot in the conservatory don't I?
C	mm
B	cos that face south
A	yeah
C	mm
B	oh look she's now gone in the nest shall we have a look at her?
A	oh you
C	no
B	let's see our birds
A	oh I
B	that's on
A	mm
B	you haven't them have you?
C	what?
A	got the camera in the box
C	mm
A	and er
B	oh what's happened to it?
C	would the power cut have upset it?
B	oh probably the power went off in the in the dairy
A	the power went off?
B	yeah
A	shall I put it have you put it back on then?
B	we've put it on in the
A	you
B	that happen?
A	you must have put it back on mustn't you?
B	er?
C	mm
B	right I have to do it with this one
C	so you've got a box cam?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	oh
B	and then she's got loads of little babies she got I think she's got ten
C	mm
B	babies
C	ten? what what what is she? a blue tit or something?
B	a blue tit yeah
B	yeah
A	in there
B	no it ain't working now
A	yeah
C	mm
B	that's a shame I'll have to go out and have a look at it
A	yeah
B	I'll run out and have a look at it now
A	yeah?
B	yeah and then
C	mm
B	if it's working
C	do you think am I allowed another biscuit? I was late this morning
A	yeah but
B	take it away from him
A	you've had lunch with us
C	I know I did yes but I didn't have much breakfast
A	oh
C	it's in it's in the microwave I put it back in the microwave
A	oh right
C	there we are
A	you need your breakfast don't you?
C	yeah
A	oh yeah?
C	cos apple's not much flavour
A	no
C	and just that just sort of gives it a
A	oh
C	mm
A	well it's like muesli then isn't it?
C	but with no nuts and things
A	oh
C	a big apple I have a half of half an apple and then this other fruit stuff it's also better for my teeth cos muesli's the worst thing for
A	yeah it does the sweetness bit I have erm
C	it just adds a little bit of sweetness
A	grape jelly on mine and then a banana
C	oh grape jelly?
A	that I made a long time ago
C	oh
A	from our grapes
C	mm
A	I hope to do that again this year cos we didn't
C	mm
A	do anything last year we
C	mm you didn't
A	they just went mouldy on the and no one can be bothered to pick them
C	mm mm
A	erm the problem with them they they're quite
C	mm
A	they're not a bad size but they are smallish and they've got pips inside
C	oh
A	and
C	and so you just
A	they're they're a fantastic flavour
C	er haven't time flown er today you know
A	eh?
C	it has flown
A	cos you were back early from church weren't you?
C	well I didn't go to two churches but we had a good old natter
A	mm
C	a lot of them are away at the minute erm and
B	fuse had gone in the dairy
C	the what?
B	the fuse had gone in the dairy
C	the fuse has gone?
B	yeah
A	oh I thought they were automatic switch up
B	that's er that switch off but the a fuse must have gone cos none of the dairy's or
A	oh gosh
C	is this on alright now is everything on in oh yeah the television's working it must be
A	yes everything's on in here it's
C	oh
B	the dairy that isn't on
A	oh right
B	I'll have to sort it out later
A	mm
B	you bought
C	mm
B	a load of fuse boxes didn't you?
C	fuse wire?
A	fuse wire
C	I have
C	yes because you don't find it everywhere
B	no they don't
A	yeah but they don't go that often do they?
C	no but but no houses are
A	yeah
C	gonna have that sort of a
A	yeah
C	fuse that you can add the wire
A	mm
C	erm
B	wow
C	you see? erm and I said well yes please erm I can do it
A	mm
C	right I'm assuming that your box is the other side of the wall here and I'm thinking oh here we go he's gonna tell me it's hopeless and I said
A	mm
C	it's one of the really old ones you know with the fuse wire he
B	did he?
C	they can't go wrong
A	oh
C	they don't switch off as quick mind you but there's nothing nothing wrong with them
B	no
C	nothing wrong with having
B	yeah
C	meter on that
B	it'll have to be
C	you until you get that
B	rewired
C	yeah no he
A	so he didn't do anything?
C	yeah no he changed it changed the changed the stuff for me but he said that what I got in there
B	was
C	what
B	was
C	was my fuse box with the wires they're the best sort when he went in because he had to go and switch it all off you see
B	yeah
C	he went in and switched it off he said no that that's fine nothing wrong with that
B	yeah?
C	that er those old-fashioned ones are the best
A	oh
B	so have you still got it?
C	so I've still got it but he's put a new meter
B	oh a new
C	he changed the meter
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	erm they're going round
A	right
C	and checked and
A	so they just have to update it?
C	they have to do it
A	yeah
C	no charge
A	mm
C	they have to do the meter
A	oh
C	so he did it he did it in about ten minutes actually
C	yeah and he didn't have a cup of tea or anything he didn't want that and off he went
A	oh
C	and that was it he said I've now got got time to try another one so he's er they're sort of they're bonuses for us if we can we get paid for each one we do but and we're
A	yeah
C	so he had
B	oh you know they come round and and and read your meter every now and then?
C	yeah
B	the stupid bloke
C	mm
B	read the read the the wrong side of it and we got charged how many hundred pounds?
A	oh erm
B	instead of thirty quid a
A	two hundred
C	mm
B	cos we don't use much in the dairy
C	mm
A	yeah what
B	instead of thirty quid every six months or four four weeks
C	mm
B	er four months three months
C	you had a nought on
B	and every
C	or something did you?
A	what happened was I wanted I said I'd change it from a business cos it was a business
C	mm mm
A	er meter a business tariff
C	mm mm
A	to an ordinary
C	yeah
A	right? should have been cheaper
C	mm
A	right? and we only
B	yeah
A	average over there because
C	mm
A	we don't go over there
C	mm
A	and especially now there isn't a freezer in there either there's nothing in there
B	it's only lights
A	really
C	yeah
A	and er
B	two hundred odd quid
A	er what? er and we we thought oh it must be the lathe you've just bought or
C	mm
A	you know cos you did do a bit of work there didn't you?
B	yeah I did a bit of work yeah
A	and I thought that's a ridiculous price and next bill
C	yeah
A	er er well they it went on for quite a while until I realised they'd been reading the wrong meter
C	the wrong bit of it
A	er
B	the wrong bit of the meter
A	a day time and a night time
C	mm and then actually
A	and they'd switched them round
B	I think we're they're we're finished
A	really we should have got back with them but
B	we should have done yeah
A	they just give us a credit you know so
C	mm
A	we haven't actually paid anything yet for
C	mm
A	for a bill over there but
C	mm
A	we should have got onto them because that
B	well they make the money don't they?
C	yeah they make money yeah
A	I phoned them up so many times
C	mm
A	and complained that
C	mm
A	it can't be right
C	yeah
A	and they
B	they don't listen to you
A	well they've been round to the
B	they don't listen to you
A	well the
B	well these these tele girls they don't they only there to answer the
C	mm
B	answer complaints and
C	stock questions
B	saying oh well we'll see what we can do finished and nothing happens
C	mm
A	like
C	oh I yeah I've I no I've I've been on a
C	and they wouldn't wouldn't have it er but we have one I can give you the reading now is it no you haven't got any gas
A	they probably got a gas cooker
C	er er
A	and a gas fire and
C	yes
A	yeah
C	yes
A	mm
C	you haven't got any gas there was no record of a meter being put into that house
B	what?
C	yeah
A	it's weird isn't it?
C	and there it was
A	why why
C	we were sit we were sat by it
A	would they want to
C	he said what you
A	so it didn't
C	the gas board say the gas supplier says we haven't got any gas running to this house
A	it's okay if they never ever find out isn't it but
C	yes but once they find out
A	one day they're gonna find out
C	they'll want it
A	and you've got a massive
C	but he was telling them
A	bill yeah
B	yeah
C	and they said no you can't have you haven't got a meter
A	yeah
B	did he have to pay in the end?
C	I bet it was the bloke who fitted it perhaps plugged it in himself or something and
B	well yeah he was probably a gas fitter were he?
C	gas fitter and probably plumbed it in from the road himself and never told them
A	yeah
B	probably
C	it's possible
A	mm
B	well er
C	actually I'm
A	er?
C	the sun
B	yeah go and have a look
