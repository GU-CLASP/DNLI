A	it's lovely
B	good good
C	really nice
B	I figured you can't really get ill from it can you?
C	I don't
B	mm
A	still the
B	do you think
C	er talking about it yeah
D	yeah I know him
C	really?
A	quite a way to come with a baby I suppose
B	yeah
C	you can have a proper play with him now
B	yeah
A	yeah it's too little
B	like it really doesn't matter that much
A	no
C	he seems quite bright to me though and he's walking around and you know
A	yeah oh yeah
B	and he's very good being passed from person to person
B	which means he does it often
A	yeah
C	has his sister got a kid yet?
D	bit off the rails I think she's
A	oh is she?
D	well I think a party girl still
A	uhu
D	she's about twenty-nine or something
B	so did you see them in
D	yeah she went away for uni but she's back now yeah
C	how much has he got on Facebook of
B	not much really
C	okay
B	but he doesn't put very much
C	yeah
B	if there was a nosy app
C	just put nosy
A	yeah
B	you know from school
C	I know that's what it's for
B	especially cos you can do it untracked
B	you can see who's looked
A	so and so is looking at you
B	I'm leaving
D	I bet she does
E	we had a Facebook first world problem the other day
A	mm
E	and er
B	but how was she his secret partner?
E	well
B	oh right
E	she was living in
B	yeah
E	you know they said they just said and leaving respects and so on
D	she can't really control what the public say about her
E	but it was only it was like
C	just unfollow that group
E	I created that group
D	she doesn't have to be in it
B	he'd obviously joined it though
E	no no he he
B	oh
E	he wasn't on there
A	she was but she was
E	she was
B	well then
A	leave the group
C	or just don't look at it
E	but she was saying she obviously that guy had just died
D	and have you got the right to
B	yeah that's right cos there might become a day
E	but she said something like erm
B	mm
E	and Facebook wasn't a part of that plan so
B	mm I read a
B	and it was about like almost like your digital
E	oh
B	like what you need to do for that
E	but what er what I did then is I posted on there saying
B	oh right
E	I said er someone from er er his family
B	yeah
D	mm
E	and they'd all left respectful messages
B	yeah
B	you know
B	no you created the group to
E	well yeah
B	keep in touch you didn't create the group for
E	I mean I I've got and I I should have said well I actually posted on myself saying yeah it's a shame he was a nice guy and you know
B	yeah
E	and er anyway it was posted on there and everyone posted on and said I'm sorry and of course they post
E	because they were posting on saying sorry
B	yeah
E	it was perpetuated so then she sent me another message
B	oh right
E	you know god knows what er
B	yeah
E	the daughters but I mean she wasn't mentioned anywhere so whether she had made all this up or
B	it can be a bit weird when people don't check this er a woman I used to work with
C	how can she automatically
B	I think I don't know like it's thing like has asked you to play Candy Crush so I don't know if somehow you're er like you're signed up for like er
E	yeah yeah
B	it automatically goes or something
E	when you sign up for it unless you say no it will automatically do stuff like that
B	the moral of that story is not to play Candy Crush
A	mm
C	everybody gets addicted though
B	I've never played it is it basically like erm
C	it's erm a simplified version of
A	yeah
C	Tetris yeah
B	yeah
C	I was quite good at it I haven't played it
A	I haven't played it for ages
D	you don't play that do you mum?
A	I haven't played any for a long long time
B	it was a bit like what was the one that used to be on the Mega Drive? and you had it with Ecco the Dolphin and
D	don't know
B	was that the same thing or Sonic
E	but they have got a problem of digital sort of legacies where people who have died
A	mm
C	you know that American film critic I don't remember his name now who died of
E	American?
C	yeah
A	mm
B	it's like that awful Black Mirror episode
C	I've not seen it
B	have you not?
C	no I've only seen the first one
B	the first ever one?
C	yeah
B	was the first ever one the pig one?
C	yeah
B	mm I wanna see it again watch it
E	what was that?
B	obviously it's not cheerful viewing
E	who was that one a celebrity
C	yeah I don't remember
E	and he was it was worth thousands and thousands dollar now
A	it's not in
E	it's not in perpetuity exactly and he couldn't leave it to his kids and it was a test case of a
B	mm what's in
A	forever
E	forever
D	so own a actual record collection that you could pass onto someone or
E	er
C	yeah
A	yeah
E	a record er
D	it's
E	I could pass on to you but like
D	he didn't really buy it then did he?
E	mm?
D	he didn't really buy it then did he?
A	no
E	no but to all intents and purposes he handed money over to pay for it
A	for twenty years or forty years or whatever
E	he thought he
D	no for personal
A	mm
E	well it was a big test
A	mm
D	but
B	I
C	it doesn't make any sense as well cos it's
A	no exactly yeah
D	yeah but you don't wanna set a precedent of one person buying something and going and sharing it with twenty friends
C	well he he can do that sort of anyway sharing IDs
A	mm
C	it's tangibly yours right? whereas yeah they
D	well it's an important lesson that you don't
E	but
D	when you buy something digital
E	that I would say that's different to say to say Netflix
A	mm to hand on
D	so you would have signed terms and agreements when you did that like you wouldn't where it says third party
E	well say on page thirty-four of the thing that you've bought
A	yeah oh
D	yeah I haven't really bought it in the traditional sense of
C	but you know
D	buying it
C	you're you're not supposed to
D	they're not gonna stop you doing it
C	they were thinking they were sort of you know that connect thing?
D	mm
C	they were
A	so they can't take photos?
D	yeah yeah
A	and take the music
B	I don't think they should do it in terms of not recording the music because it's the copyright of the artist I think they should just do it cos it's just really annoying
D	yeah they shouldn't do it and they advise
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	with the with the like the flashing lights on record
A	cos there was someone coming round in Dylan concern wasn't it?
E	it was a big thing in the Dylan concert
B	and how many people in the concert to control that?
E	well that that was the thing it was er er it was I mean you know
B	oh right
E	and it was like it they they were obvious then they weren't nasty exactly but they were big guys and they were
B	yeah
E	in no uncertain terms saying no no you
B	the pantomime I went to at Christmas which was in like my local theatre I could see people cos we were like in the towards the back so I could see there was a couple of people recording it cos obviously it like it's shines a light and er at the interval erm
A	mm
B	and said like you really have to stop doing that
A	mm
B	and I was like blimey that's quite strict and also thinking like that's the job of the the
A	ushers that were there
B	of the ushers that's the only thing they're there for
A	mm
B	if they're in the performance otherwise they could just go off and have a cup of tea cos otherwise they have to watch it like fifty times
A	yeah
B	and then halfway through the second half they put all
E	wow
B	these people have stopped recording it's illegal we take it very seriously
A	mm
B	and everyone just was silent and then the entire audience just went oh with this poor girl stood there just going
E	oh yes we can
B	yeah and it was just so stupid and then at the end of the show
A	oh wow
E	that's a
B	it's like god it's just a local pantomime they were
E	well one was
B	they're not recording to sell it they're recording it
E	well
B	cos their little Johnny is in the third row
E	well what was what was that for? they was it simply the fact that they were duplicating it or was it because it was shining a light?
B	oh no cos they were they thought they were duplicating it
E	okay
B	probably because they thought they were gonna go and sell it but I don't imagine in a million years
A	no
B	they were doing that
E	cos there was a thing there was something last week in in some play in the west end someone was erm
B	mm
E	and the actor I think it was a Shakespeare one of the Shakespearian the actor got out of character
D	good
B	yeah
E	well yeah yeah
C	well
A	mm
C	sentimental denouement
A	mm
C	he had you know
A	mm
E	but from a sort of erm
C	yeah I don't I don't care if he's not paying attention it's just it it's a
B	it's the lights
C	screen in the
E	that's it
B	yeah
E	you're right you you can't you can't tell him off for not paying attention
B	no
E	you know but you can if he's doing something that erm
B	but they did that in that in the first few weeks that Benedict Cumberbatch was Hamlet and he kept stopping
E	oh that's right
B	the performance cos all he could see was just red lights
E	mm
B	of people just recording him
E	mm
C	although ironically you know there's the the bootleg
E	yeah
C	label are are grateful for all that
E	and some bands
C	and even
C	did anybody bootleg my two thousand and twelve performance cos I've lost
C	lost my notes? and
E	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
E	yeah
A	oh god
E	and some
A	are you gonna have a second
D	no I'm full
E	an area reserved for people in the old days with tripods and whatever they used to have an area at the front of the stage reserved for people to record their shows because they felt it was a
D	right
E	so they you know some bands will will will do it I I think with the Dylan thing I think it was
C	yeah but he's not even looking at the performance
C	you know
E	mm
C	the it it's a very rare it's very rare you'll see footage of him live
E	no well no
C	that it's not you know
E	er well exactly why I guess because er
B	they're better off just getting one person to record it
C	mm yeah
B	photos and they're yours and they're free just don't
E	yeah
B	like what are you filming it for?
E	but you said that thing about the er the local pantomime and they they stood on the people and said to delete from a legal point of view that's gotta be very dodgy you know someone's own property
A	it's probably on the tickets
B	yeah
A	probably on the tickets
B	it's probably is on the ticket saying
E	well
C	yeah and you like you can't record films right you know you know that's illegal to
E	yeah but but I'm saying well you
D	they can throw you out but they can't make you
D	do something to your own camera
E	that's that's that's right that's right
B	mm
E	although obviously they did
B	yeah but it was the end of the show so they were
E	yeah
B	oh I'm going now anyway
E	and again would they have stopped them leaving you know? it's a difficult
B	it was just it was just really unnecessary
D	they can't stop you leaving though
A	no confiscate your phone
D	they can't touch your phone can't touch you and they can't stop you leaving
B	it was just a very dramatic end to Beauty and the Beast
A	it was gosh
D	yeah but you will think twice about going there again
B	yeah
D	like if you treat people like
B	yeah
B	it was just a bit it was just a bit daft it made them look silly didn't make them look like we were the ones in the wrong it made them look like they were just like party poopers really
E	they did it at a football game didn't they? at a
D	have they?
E	couple of football games yeah they've or is that Arsenal? they've er they was you know people blatantly filming a penalty kick or a free kick or something and
D	there's thousands of them do it
E	yeah but you know
E	they the they knew and and because they they were season ticket holders and I think they had a letter
B	for for what reason?
C	cos it
E	copyright
C	cos cos Sky
E	copyright
C	Sky Sports own that right?
B	jesus
A	mm
B	oh
D	it's a modern world
B	a cheeky snooze
A	yeah a cheeky snooze
D	gonna have a bit of carrot cake?
B	no I'm just have a
A	oh there's the carrot cake you can have or
B	a cream egg
A	a cream egg cream for the for the chef
A	oh the there's
B	oh there's a little bit left over

A	oh okay
