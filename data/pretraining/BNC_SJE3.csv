A	so is
B	as far as I know erm yeah it's just er money-wise for us and we worked it out last night and it's gonna be about a thousand pounds for both of us so
A	well if it's too much I mean you know don't we won't but you've definitely got to
B	yeah yeah no we'll er we'll definitely try and save for it
A	does she wanna go out?
B	maybe shall I go and see? let's go
A	okay
B	no there's no issue
A	the company
B	oh god no
A	oh good that's alright then
B	she's been on a walk this morning
A	mm
B	I'm probably just going to stand by the door
A	well the accommodation they came up with did they say how much that was gonna be then per person?
B	I think it was about a
A	so that's quite pricey isn't it? I mean the other thing is we go back to the hotel idea
B	yeah
A	cos
B	yeah yeah that that I think that's the that's the big one there and if they wanna do the Blue Lagoon I mean that's another forty or fifty quid each isn't it?
A	is it?
B	yeah cos they said that was quite expensive so we haven't even factored the food into that
A	no
B	thousand pounds
A	it's gonna be a lot
B	yeah
A	mm oh well we'll see what they come up with
B	yeah
A	nice flowers what were they for?
B	Mother's Day
A	oh they've lasted well
B	yeah I got them
A	yes
B	they're wilting somewhat now
A	well your dad's gone off to his meeting obviously his hour meetings when I expect to see him at five o'clock tonight
B	oh yes well those meetings
A	well he went at half past ten yeah
B	half past ten to six o'clock
A	he said he was gonna be back by lunchtime
B	oh okay
A	and had done some shopping
B	oh
A	there's a few things on the list
B	me and
A	oh yeah it's a bit depressing I've got to
B	indeed
A	stop eating now this is ridiculous
B	stop eating just stop altogether
A	well I haven't it's been good I haven't been to the shops to look at clothes for ages I didn't
B	no
B	mm a fortnight
B	well I bought a jacket
A	oh did you?
B	from New Look the other week and a couple of tops
A	yeah
B	the tops one of them fits me the other one doesn't and the jacket doesn't fit me yet over my arms that's why I need to
A	well why have you bought them then?
B	because I'm gonna get into them
A	oh I never do that
B	that's the incentive
A	oh I would never do that
B	well I know I'm gonna lose weight anyway so eh?
A	I take it they were cheap?
B	they weren't that expensive I think the jacket was only about well
A	what colour?
B	twenty-five it's nice it's like a erm it's not I don't know how to describe it erm it's not like a solid colour is kind of a it's not a pattern either I'll show you what
A	what to wear with jeans or?
B	yeah
A	oh nice
B	I wore
A	lovely
B	so I tried it on in the shop with this jumper and I thought oh it'll just be the jumper it's fine
A	yeah
B	but then I got back and I tried it on
A	oh and it was still a bit tight?
B	and it was like you know when you can't move your arms?
A	yeah
B	and you think this isn't comfortable
A	New Look always do that for me though I think they do very small
B	small
A	I I think they do because I can never get my arms into
B	they do it differently with every piece of clothing cos that coat out there's a ten from New Look and that still fits me
A	oh yeah mm
B	and it's tight when I do it up
B	but the arms are fine
A	well like I said seeing that that dress online I'll have to find it the one I quite fancied from Wallis
B	mm
A	and then looking at the picture I'm not sure if it's a bit short
B	oh okay
A	it's a high neck
B	yeah
A	erm and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so it mightn't be quite that long but quite well short but I don't know
B	is this for the christening?
A	yeah but whether I get myself any I have got plenty
B	yes mm
A	and I've got the blue one
B	yeah it's nice
A	as well and it's also like that shift dress in the lace with the white underneath
B	and you've got the patterned one haven't you?
A	then I've got that patterned one that's in the photo
B	all green and white and black
A	yeah and I've got all the all the colours in there they're all nice with heels and a jacket
B	yes
A	I have got quite a lot
B	yeah
A	I don't know if the shift ones will fit at the moment the coral and the navy
B	mm
A	that other one is stretchier
B	stretchy
A	and I've got a nice one from Phase Eight I've not worn yet it's it's
B	oh oh really?
A	blue and white I bought it
B	you've got a few choices
A	did I buy it last year or did I buy it the year before? I think I've had it two years
B	I don't know
A	every time I put it on I think oh I just look a bit fat in it
B	well how long have we got a month?
A	five weeks come on let's
B	five weeks
A	oh we've got Easter in the middle of that though
B	yeah Easter is in the middle of it and it's gonna fall apart isn't it?
A	well Easter is just gonna have to be one day
B	I'm gonna allow myself yeah one day fit
A	one day so do you want an Easter egg?
B	no let's not add to the
A	let's not add to the trauma
B	to the feast
A	does
B	no don't bother what?
A	it's a bit mean isn't it?
B	what do you mean it's a bit mean?
A	well not buying
B	well okay buy him a mint Aero one then because I don't like mint Aero
A	oh okay alright then
B	I think he only likes yeah he likes mint Aero I bought him a
A	what he does or you think he does?
B	I've bought him a peanut M and M one
A	egg?
B	yeah
A	oh you've bought them already?
B	I've got I saw it in Sainsbury's the other day
A	oh
B	it's hidden in the boot of my car but then he went to get the pram out and could see it was in there
A	do you like Snickers?
B	he likes Snickers
A	do you?
B	yes
A	oh
B	it'll be alright buy me it and I'll just tell him to the problem is he doesn't eat them quickly
A	I know
B	like he just kind of has a bit and then puts it back
A	I know how do they do that?
B	and I'm like why don't you just eat the whole egg?
A	well it's nice yeah if we're going to eat it we're going to eat it aren't we?
B	well yeah
A	properly or you'd have to sort of
A	and he'll have to eat them all on Easter Sunday
B	well yeah that's what I was saying to him and I was saying we can't have any of these left on Monday
A	well I'll see mm
B	okay yeah if you see one you know but don't go out of your way to get one
A	well I've got to go and get some I'll have to get one for the boys
B	oh yeah I suppose
A	you don't need to get the boys anything
B	no no no I'm talking about you
A	I I'll take them one and then
B	I might just take some chocolate around there on Easter Sunday and I'll just get them all kind of
A	yeah
B	I'll just take a
A	I would
B	I might get just a big egg for them all or something
A	that's a good idea
B	I'm making a cake anyway aren't I? so
A	yeah you are
B	let's not go mad
A	the trouble they they could just eat and eat and eat those boys couldn't they?
B	of course they could
A	are you going to let her in?
B	I'll just go and let the dog in so yeah I'm making I planned planned to make that cake
A	how is it constructed that one how is it like that M and M cake where you've
B	mm
A	got to have some sort of pipe cleaner or something inside it to?
B	well my mother-in-law bought me a set at Christmas
A	a set of what?
B	she bought me a proper like it's a you have a base
A	yeah
B	and then attached to it is a tube that goes up like that
A	oh
B	like a plastic tube
A	especially for making these
B	especially for making those types of cakes
A	cos that that one
B	so I'll use that and it'll be easier
A	that one had a chocolate egg didn't it and then it had little eggs coming out of it?
B	yeah yeah so I'll just I'll royal ice it to it or something so it'll stick the eggs around the tube
A	right
B	and then the and it had like chocolate cake around the bottom with flakes around the outside
A	yeah yeah
B	to look like a nest
A	flakes look good a nest yeah that'll look good
B	yeah and I'll make that
A	but then you've got to transport it
B	yeah I know I never think about that bit
A	that's I know it's great when you make it and put it on the work surface it's carrying them isn't it?
B	well none of them have fallen apart yet touch wood
A	no no they haven't no I don't know how you do it?
B	and to be honest they are quite sturdy once you've
A	you couldn't' assemble it and put the egg on at the other end maybe?
B	well it'll just take
A	oh it takes too long does it?
B	I could put the egg on cos I could just really put that on the top and it wouldn't be a
A	no that wouldn't be a problem
B	I'll see
A	how long is it going to take to make? is it an all-day job again?
B	oh I don't know erm no because it's just a basic chocolate cake and then it's not a really like intricate icing is it? it's there's not a lot of cutting out shapes of
A	mm
B	rolled icing which seems to take the time whenever I do make a cake
A	oh right
B	it's all just putting it together and making sure it doesn't fall apart
A	fair enough
B	I'm hoping it'll be alright
A	well I didn't leave a note to tell your dad where I was I was gonna say erm don't bother about the dishwasher it seems to have fixed itself
A	spend some time fixing the light
B	mm
A	mm
B	and then I thought to myself oh I'll just see if it shuts
B	yeah it was gonna happen that way wasn't it?
A	so this job he's got
B	mm
A	erm he's gonna get deals on cars presumably?
B	I hope so
A	so when he was talking
B	I don't know
A	oh he's well he's he's bound he's bound to get
B	yeah but not enough to maybe bring it down underneath the price of a I don't know he's looking at a SEAT one as well he's he's got loads in mind for me so
A	oh has he?
B	I said just get me a big one
A	but Jaguar Land Rover do they just do Jaguars and Land Rovers or do they have
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	Fiat and Alfa and Ferrari
A	but I'm thinking if that's the company you're working for is it just those models?
B	I don't know what
A	not that they're bad models but they're very expensive models aren't they?
B	yeah exactly that's it so I don't know whether he'll look into it and he'll get the best deal anyway he spends enough time looking at cars
A	he likes cars so when when's his deal is up first isn't it on his car?
B	yeah erm
A	so is he changing his first?
B	I don't know I don't know what he's planning with his erm he wants if I get a big car he wants a saloon
A	does he why?
B	yes I don't know
B	I don't know anyway he'll er
A	big dog big cars eh
B	yeah
A	yes with a big garden for you yes sit down there
B	I just want a car that I don't have to clamber into the back seat to put him in and
A	mm
B	take the wheel off the pushchair to get it in the boot and
A	I know
B	I can actually put the seat and the pushchair in the boot rather than have to put the seat
A	yeah
B	on the chair and
A	have you got erm an airbag in the front of yours you'd have to turn off if you put him in the front?
B	well why did you have the Fiat? I said well I didn't exactly plan having a baby this soon did I?
A	no you changed all your plans well you did plan on having a baby you brought your plans forward
B	that's it
A	you didn't think about didn't think about the Fiat
B	no of course I didn't think about the Fiat
A	yeah well I spoke to
B	yeah yeah
A	and he'd be in his highchair by then and keeping us all busy and then she said erm she said oh well
B	alright
A	I said I think she's waiting so she can have a natural labour next time instead and what?
B	yeah
A	is a big thing so I said they told you you had to wait well I don't know three or maybe two years before you get pregnant I don't know
B	well it's it's the whole house situation as well and I need to be
A	mm
B	back at work and you know stable like back at work so that we could have a mortgage on another house and
A	yeah
B	because otherwise you know there's no chance of a
A	well you did everything in the first year didn't you?
B	oh yeah had the year now
A	you got it all you got the house got the dog got the baby
B	do it again
A	yeah
B	half horse half dog
A	mm
B	mm oh
A	I said well she goes well we never even did it for ours I said you didn't bother? and she goes oh not for
A	yeah they never had anything
B	no
A	a fireguard mind you if they were in that house they didn't need one stairgates no because I said cupboard locks? no I said oh she said oh no just let him wander around he was fine
A	well
B	yeah yeah
B	oh he did lots when he was up on the work surfaces
A	well
B	yeah
A	tried to for all the good that did him
B	yes
B	yeah she was saying to me when they kept her
A	is he seventeen or eighteen now?
B	he'll be eighteen tomorrow
A	eighteen tomorrow
B	I think yeah
A	is it already? crikey
B	whoa
A	you're getting so big
B	it'll be his birthday before we know it
A	I know what are you doing for that?
B	a cake
A	a cake
B	I'll be off for it because it's a Thursday
A	ah yes
B	is it Thursday? yes it is
A	yes it is born on a Tuesday
B	because he was born on a Tuesday a leap year I'll be at home with
A	oh is he?
B	yeah
A	oh that's good
B	I was a bit annoyed when I thought about it that they didn't offer it him you know where he is at the moment
A	as in terms of what were what were the arrangements because?
B	well he you know he'd have the opportunity to maybe do a seven till three working day or an eight till four and get home a little bit earlier or
A	mm oh that's good
B	work from home one day if he ever needed to erm I just think they could have offered cos he goes in and unless he's got a client meeting it's very much like well he sits at a computer and he takes calls and answers emails and it's like well he could do that at home
A	mm
B	you know if he needed to
A	yeah
B	and for example you know there's gonna you know there's gonna come a time in the next couple of years where he's gonna be ill and it's like oh well we don't wanna put him in a nursery that day well obviously we can't put him in a nursery that day
A	they wouldn't let you either?
B	no or erm you know we don't want to bring him over to you or and
A	no
B	that quickly
A	no
B	I can't yeah kids come to me to be taught erm so it would be good if he can then just say oh I wanna work from home today
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh yeah you need flexibility when they're
B	yeah
A	when they're little like that
B	well yeah that's it and I was a bit annoyed at the job that he was in at at the moment that they didn't offer him that I thought they would have kind of said oh erm you know if you ever need any time or I mean he's got a key to open up and things he could have gone in at eight o'clock and left at four you know? they never said to him oh
A	mm
B	I don't think he really asked but he's always in for half past eight anyway and they never say to him at half past four oh just go
A	yeah I wonder what they'll say? when is he going to tell them?
B	well this week when he gets his yeah he keeps er he said to me last night he said oh I know exactly what they'll say when
A	they'll offer him more money and he'll stay?
B	well he doesn't no he doesn't think they will
A	oh I'll be amazed if they didn't
B	that's what I thought but there's
A	what do you think'll happen then?
B	well he thinks because they'll you know they'll get a new trainee kind of like that and and I said yeah but they have invested quite a lot of time in you
A	mm
B	erm so they'll know they haven't been that that brilliant erm always but you know
A	earn them a lot of money
B	exactly yeah that he does earn them a heck of a lot of money cos he doesn't get paid a fraction of what he should be for the work that he's putting out and he does
A	yeah
B	work for the other people as well
A	yeah
B	erm his supervisings or whatever erm but yeah so I was just yeah he he just doesn't seem to think that they'll what well what
B	he said he said at Christmas he very much got the impression that erm cos quite a few of them have left the trainees that started at the same time as him there's no one within the
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	are they expecting him to leave then do you think?
B	well I don't know but at Christmas time it was like he I think they realised that this well it probably happens kind of every few years when they get a bulk of trainees in
A	yeah
B	and they obviously kind of erm tail out and I don't know whether they thought oh erm it looks like
A	yeah
B	he said it's confusing more than anything and he looks forward to kind of going somewhere and having one line manager and that's it
A	yeah
B	erm but yeah one of them said to him oh you are you still enjoying work are you still enjoying yourself? and I think he said well not as much as I was
A	mm
B	but you know just say that
A	yeah
B	erm and this guy was like oh well I I do try you know I'm trying to bring you work down from
A	yeah
B	up and down and works in both offices and and he said oh yeah well I'm you know I am trying erm and hopefully you know I'll get I'll get you more and more stuff that you're kind of erm interested in
A	yeah
B	so I think that's the way that
A	yeah
B	erm so it's
A	mm
B	difficult cos well he he doesn't he doesn't know and I know I've said I'll be surprised if they don't
A	try and keep him
B	try and keep you
A	yeah I think they will
B	because the other you know
A	yeah
B	midlife crisis?
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah yeah
B	by offering him you know more money as they do erm but yeah
A	I think I think they'll offer him more
B	that's what I said to him I said I'll be
A	they'll probably ask him what what he's gonna get and see if they can match it
B	yeah yeah yeah cos you cos you'd be
A	and is he prepared for what he's gonna say whether that happens?
B	no I need to ask him tonight
A	he wouldn't he wouldn't cos yeah he needs to know because if they say you know we'll give you another ten grand
B	yeah yeah yeah I'll say I'm going to ask him what
A	and if that's more than his actual increase in this new one
B	yeah I mean they're gonna they're gonna turn around and say well look you're the benefits are private you know being in a private practice rather than in-house you'll be you can get further on the you know pay scale wise
A	right
B	cos yeah they are gonna ask him why he's gonna leave aren't they? but
A	yeah
B	so and and
A	I think he needs to be ready for for that cos if they did
B	yeah
A	throw another ten grand in
B	yeah
A	he needs to have thought about actually what he does want just in case
B	yeah yeah but
A	cos I don't know how much more this company is paying him to start with but erm
B	no
A	but you know he needs to he needs to just think about it
B	yeah definitely when does it become
A	because they might say they might say to him what are they offering you? or
B	yeah yeah I think
A	well we'll beat it
B	yeah
A	that's what if it any company that values him and I think he he will be valued
B	yeah
A	he's probably more valued than he realises
B	than he realises yeah definitely
A	I think I think so he needs to be ready for that one
B	yeah
A	he needs to know
B	I'll ask him what his response is to that
A	because he's gotta think about it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but if they do he needs to know now what what
B	is it worth it?
A	he would rather do yeah
B	mm
A	with the potential of getting better work or or thinking now I've given it long enough and I really do wanna move and I don't want to have to go in this process of erm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	being interviewed again you know and not turn turn somebody down now I've had a good offer
B	mm yeah
A	especially if it's a firm he wants to work for which it is
B	yeah
A	and I think he's probably erm yes
B	I think I think it's gonna take something quite big for
A	he hasn't got to stay with the new company forever
B	no no no that's it yeah
A	you know but if he does two or three years there and wants to move on again and er absolutely
B	mm
A	so I I don't envisage him staying somewhere for life because that's probably the the way you're going to earn more money anyways by moving companies half the time
B	yeah
A	because otherwise you just you do get stuck
B	mm
A	but it's when you come up with a job offer and they'll say oh they'll realise they're underpaying you and go right come on we wanna keep you and we'll give you this
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm I don't know what his cut off point is gonna be? I
A	well you know there may not be one the the fact of the matter is he may really wanna move to this job
B	yeah which I think is
B	to be honest
A	yeah and he
B	and he really doesn't want to be where he is at the moment
A	and if that's what he wants to do he's getting more money for it anyway and he's happy and he needs to move then it probably er that's probably what he wants and that he should do what
A	he wants to do it shouldn't be all just about the money it should be
B	no I know and he and he he well he's turned around to me in the last few weeks and just said oh it's you know it's not about the money and I said well good
A	yes he's been that miserable and he needs to do something he wants to do
B	yeah
A	so I think a change is probably a really good idea anyway
B	I said to him with regards to telling his mum
A	oh yeah
B	I said you should just wait until like they actually ask you how work is
A	yeah
B	like a few months a time and say oh by the way
A	I think I would
B	yeah? don't bother?
A	no unless he wants to tell his dad cos he does get on well with his dad doesn't he?
B	yeah
A	well she never asks about anything by the sound of it
B	no
A	she doesn't have anything to talk about why doesn't she ask?
B	she doesn't she doesn't she just doesn't
A	why doesn't she make conversation when she only sees you once a a or twice a month?
B	I know
A	well no does she see you every week? not always
B	not always no
A	once a fortnight
B	they're away aren't they a lot? they're away at Easter oh we'll have to drop your Easter presents around next week
A	oh are they going away for Easter? oh well that's good then so you haven't got another invitation you have to turn down
B	no
A	because you're not getting one
B	well we won't get one
A	where are they going? abroad are they?
B	Spain
A	oh
A	I know they don't
B	and
A	oh right so what's he having?
B	he's having a Mazda that's what he had previously
A	yeah
B	he's having a high spec he's thinking of getting himself a retirement present as well
A	such as what?
B	a personalised number plate
B	and I'm sat there and I'm like mm okay do you still want petrol money
A	yeah
B	I was thinking okay but there was no no there was no mention of oh now
A	they didn't say anything?
B	no
A	maybe they're waiting for you they they think there's no need at the moment as well because you're not working
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	there's maybe that but I
B	yeah
A	do you think do you think he will want to? well no I don't suppose you will see more of
B	no no I won't no I won't see any more of him definitely not and I mean I know
A	right
B	and she works from home one day which
A	right
B	which is why I was even more
A	well she could easily pitch up one every now and again to see him or
B	oh yeah absolutely
A	so she could take him out for a walk or something
B	yeah no she erm she's not interested though so I was so surprised when she came around yesterday
A	well I'm not and I think it's because of the godmother thing
B	yeah
A	I think I think
B	who? well it was like who have you who have you chosen?
A	here we are here here's
B	who have you chosen? and it's like
A	and she should be your first choice
B	yeah and to be
A	no
B	and I would have said that I I think if she wasn't there
A	right
B	it's kind of all a bit
A	yeah
B	it was just so awkward
A	did she hold him? did they?
B	yeah yeah erm cos he was cos he'd been up since half past five yesterday morning
A	oh right
B	and they came around at half ten
A	and he hadn't had his sleep in that time?
B	he had had a little sleep but from quarter past nine until half past nine so
A	okay yeah
B	he was really like grouchy still so he was in his pushchair in the kitchen watching
A	yeah
B	and
A	oh right
B	we get a get a rare rare picture then it was so funny because
A	I know she never has a smile on her face does she?
B	no I know so I thought don't you sit there and try and force him to smile
A	oh dear
B	he doesn't know who told him he hasn't got a clue who you are so
A	yeah
B	erm but I just thought oh
A	well you won't have to have them on the christening photos I think you just want a few informal ones you can do a few nice ones
B	yeah yeah
A	with you and the godparents and that that's really what
B	yeah yeah I mean hopefully it'll be be like this
A	well if it's like this it'll be lovely won't it? mm
B	yeah with the church it'll be or outside at the back of the conservatory
A	I must remember to ask
B	yeah yeah and I imagine
A	yes he'll he'll bring his anyway I'm sure
B	yeah
A	yeah that'll be nice
B	yeah it will be erm
A	you haven't heard back from
B	no not yet erm
A	what days does she work in the bridal shop?
B	I think she's in the bridal shop on Wednesday this week so I might just might pop over on the way over to you
A	okay
B	yeah I might do yeah
A	it would be easier to go on the way back
B	I can't it's
A	no I'm just thinking of the
B	it would be far too late
A	yes I'm just thinking of the position of the where it is
B	yeah yeah I know but getting him off to sleep anyway so
A	yeah
B	I'll go in the afternoon at some some point erm we saw him in panto him on TV
A	oh on yes the ventriloquist didn't he win the America's Got Talent?
B	did he?
A	I think so
B	oh
A	and he's made it big in the States
B	oh
A	but yeah he was on there
B	well look at it his eyes huh?
A	he's got how much makeup is he wearing?
A	oh somebody's
B	oh yes they were doing the smoky eyes
A	oh they've made him up have they? yeah
B	oh my life
A	good old Gino what does he look like?
A	smoky eyes oh I wonder if he's done it for a joke
B	yeah so I'm gonna I might ask
A	oh right
B	he said well I was gonna ask the erm cos I thought it'd be nice not a tree but like having a baby in a like a sling thing and then balloons and people's fingerprints as the balloons
A	oh to do a oh I see
B	yeah
A	it'll give her a whole new er
B	but I'll send her a picture of kind of what I've finished
A	yeah I'm sure she would
B	yes
A	I don't know that you'd need to invite her you you could do but
B	but I thought he was gonna he was gonna do it when we're there cos I'm not standing with him
A	no that's true yeah
B	so I don't really want to ask anyone else
A	I mean don't forget you've not invited
B	yeah I know
A	is that something you're thinking though it's got quite big?
B	well
A	no I haven't but your dad'll have it
B	I might just text dad's phone
A	text him yeah
B	I'll yeah get the number off dad
A	I think because it's got as big as it has it's
B	yeah I know they won't come anyway so
A	well they probably won't will they? or there'll there'll be an excuse or maybe she won't
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it won't be so bad it's not like a wedding so and that'll be fine then if she comes
B	I tell you what I might text dad now and just say look
A	ask for his number
B	can you send me Uncle
A	yeah just because I think it seems to have got yeah and then nobody will ever need know we were considering not inviting them
B	yeah
A	I think if it was a smaller affair you know and you were talking about twenty people cos there's another five of them and fair enough but now we're up to numbers we're up to but like I say I wouldn't necessarily add on to the catering for
B	no no no I'm just doing it
A	because there'll be plenty of food cos she always does masses on her buffets doesn't she?
B	yeah yeah she's not gonna stand there and headcount for goodness sake
A	oh no of course not
B	send me
A	I imagine your dad will go and see them today because he hasn't seen them for a week
B	oh
A	I don't think he saw them last week with him being in Scotland
B	oh okay
A	so I imagine he'll go today
B	yeah when he gets home from his
A	I think he's working Tuesday Wednesday
B	six-hour meeting
A	yeah Tuesday Wednesday Saturday I think
B	mm
A	and
B	tomorrow is she?
A	and Thursday and Sunday is what she's I think because she didn't have that day off last week she's
B	yes I knew she was having an extra one off this week
A	yeah I do fancy going to Birmingham to look at erm outfits cos I I liked that you know the the House of Fraser they've got there? it's
B	yeah
A	that we went to before with the Wallis section and you came with me didn't you?
B	yeah
A	cos they have so many more things there than they do
B	I could go on Thursday
A	well we haven't lost any weight yet
B	if
A	I don't really need one either but I just wanna have a look I might leave it a couple of weeks
B	I'm got my own yeah I'm gonna wear that one that I've got upstairs you know the dress with the
A	the blue and white?
B	mm
A	yes because you had another one but that was for your baby shower was that pink and blue?
B	yeah pink and blue yeah
A	the similar style with the polka dots
B	yeah yeah
A	is that the one?
B	it was different material
A	but
B	eight months pregnant
A	so you're not talking about that dress?
B	no I'm not wearing that one I think that's the
A	oh yeah
B	no the other one I had was it's
A	oh it wasn't a maternity dress?
A	yes it was just the
B	no do you remember they were in Debenham's
A	oh yeah
B	was it Debenham's?
A	much smaller little
B	mm
A	polka dot on it tiny
B	well it's not it's not even I don't think it's a polka dot
A	no it's not
B	it's like bows or something like that
A	yeah it's so
B	yeah
A	yes when
B	she'll probably ask me if I'm sure I'm not pregnant again at the
A	oh she better not
B	I'll say er how about a smile
A	yeah yeah you should point the camera smile
B	smile
B	smile oh no yes no it's going to be great standing up in a church oh could the godparents please come forward?
A	yes
B	that'll be my sister
B	and our friends
A	mm
B	mm oh I don't know it's not as if she hasn't got the time to
A	well she hasn't said if she's coming to the christening has she?
B	well no I don't know
A	any of them haven't replied have they?
B	oh no well
A	oh that's right pushed them and they said yes
B	she better not just turn up with like a million bracelets or something I don't want them
A	no
B	or like sparkles for the table or she can throw them
A	it's the fact she won't let you know it's the fact she just muscles in on everything
B	I know that was exactly like it for the wedding like I gave her the tables I think I'd given her tables
A	yeah yeah
B	she'll like that and yes okay they they did contribute so she needed something
A	yeah yeah
B	but then it was like oh by the way I've bought this oh by the not
A	I know I know
B	you know as the bride
A	yeah
B	maybe oh well I've seen these what do you think or erm I've done you you know you know er do you think these would look nice or what are your thoughts on these?
A	they're very manipulative that whole family is
B	oh yeah they are
A	they're really manipulative
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	everything that they do is geared to
B	yeah yeah
A	getting their own way and it's ridiculous
B	well I know and I'm just like I mean he has
A	well I can't imagine
B	yeah he does
A	he never seems he never comes across as?
B	no no he's quite a rare a rare breed
A	it's yeah it's just the way they use every situation like she did with the erm well the hen do she invited her own person didn't she? she invited her friend to the hen do
B	yeah big
A	that's right and then the baby shower when she just forwarded the text and told me she'd invited people without even asking and now
B	I mean yeah
A	yeah
B	but at the same time it was like well what on earth are we meant to say to that?
A	well yeah there's
B	obviously before she'd texted her back
A	yeah
B	she'd been straight on to
A	yeah yeah
B	oh have you had a text? and he'd obviously replied and said no
A	yeah and that's why I think
B	oh of course yeah of course they told them
A	straightaway so they think you've got an issue with them
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah erm
A	I think not the fact that you're trying to keep it down
B	and she's obviously I think she's annoyed with us
A	oh on DVD
B	mm yeah that'll be good er
A	I want to see that one
B	she's obviously I don't think she's erm offered to do anything for the christening because of that whole oh you're not inviting my whole family where you should think well you
A	well her family are invited
B	of course they are but it
A	oh
A	well only
B	yeah exactly yeah I know and
B	her and
A	yeah
B	and
A	oh can't he?
B	no he's been he's got some VIP concert experience and he's been waiting for thirty-five years to see this this band so
B	yeah yeah I mean
A	yeah that's right the fewer of them that come the better
B	yeah yeah
B	he's also not like them
A	no he's a bit more laid-back isn't he?
B	well
A	is he he's her twin isn't he?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he's alright
A	I was going to say why his wife doesn't bother with any of them
B	well exactly you
A	you've never met her have you?
B	no I said you I said I know that you that that you think that it's the reason what happened was I think the whole reason behind it is they were in Florida one year and
A	yeah
B	and they were just sat in their rooms and
A	mhm
B	but hadn't asked
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and so then I think she just said something to
A	right
A	mm
B	erm but I think I think there's much more to it than that erm I I don't know what you know what she's done but
A	it's funny cos
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you should erm you should take
B	yeah definitely yeah
A	of of all of the family
B	and so that would what would that that would do to his mother?
A	do you know where he lives? because if ever you were passing that way say
B	I don't know where he lives
A	oh give give your uncle a call and see if we can call in cos his wife you know your auntie hasn't met
B	his
A	never be there but there'd be no reason not to and
B	oh no
A	likewise she's perfectly pleasant and she's got her issues with
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and you'd probably have er
B	yeah yeah
A	you'd probably get on fine
B	yeah I think I mean I it is a bit I just
A	it's got to be
B	oh yeah I just reckon I think it's a bit odd that she really doesn't have anything to do with any of them like and she'd like obviously you've had your fair share of
A	grief
B	the brunt from dad's side but
A	yeah
B	I mean yes okay you won't go row with them every single time you see them but if there's ever kind of a a big thing like a big birthday or and everyone's going you you won't purposefully not go I mean you'll say oh do we have to? but
A	oh yeah I'll always go to it
B	of course you will but so that's something that she never you know never do this woman so
A	well that's what
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	stay out of everything
B	yeah so then you think okay she could be a little bit like her because
A	mm
B	but then again
A	well I don't know why
B	no
A	I mean at your baby shower she didn't even speak to her sister
B	no I know
A	who she personally invited
B	I know it's awful
A	because I must admit I'd forgotten about inviting them and if she'd have said oh can we? I'd have gone yes of course
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but she sent me
B	why should you invite? them she's my
A	well yes yeah
B	husband's auntie it's not like
A	nothing to do with you no you're right
B	no nothing to do with me whatsoever
A	oh look they're on the trampettes on there I need to get mine back out
B	but erm yeah I know because there's no connection with me and them whatsoever
A	mm
B	erm I don't you know particularly get on with them and
A	she just competes with her sister for who can do the most erm
B	oh yeah
A	outrageous presents for everybody and it's just a competition anyway and I know that's
B	presents are the competition
A	yeah like
B	no
A	oh not for me thank you oh not but in the end I just bypassed her and not
B	yeah bye yeah not for you
A	not for you not for me thank you
B	oh dear
A	and
B	that's what she's going to do at the christening and I'll say well bring your own wine if you want to do that
A	oh well if she's gonna bring her own hopefully she won't bring that much and she'll be alright
B	mm she'll drink everyone else's
A	I won't bring any red
B	no no
A	because that's all she drinks
B	yeah
A	I'm only taking white
B	erm no definitely
A	do we have to provide glasses or? okay
B	no no no they're all there
A	she'll have the glasses if we want like a Prosecco and a toast or something
B	yeah yeah they will be there
A	will she? because we should maybe
B	I'll text her about that
A	yeah
B	but yeah they've done like all the
A	but you could also mention on the invite to your friends nearer the time you know
B	yeah
A	it is it's it's a it's a bring a bottle

B	yeah but it's it's either you
