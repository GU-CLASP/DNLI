A	okay so
B	I'm being held at gunpoint
A	don't say that
B	help me
B	you've got me trapped
A	in a bar yeah right
B	I guess are you alright to sort that currently drinking a lot of white wine
A	well I've technically had half a bottle when I've had these two cos
B	might wanna play that back
A	it's horrible listening back to my voice cos I have to listen to like the first five minutes so when I'm filling forms in erm I have to erm listen to the first five minutes to ascertain what it is
A	yeah
B	take it down
A	yeah so nine grand just to explain a word that I already know but erm
B	I know some pretty big words too I can teach you them if you want
B	er you've got to use them in context though you can't just blurt out a word cos if you think of a big word
A	is your is your is is
B	the biggest word I know is
A	that is actually the longest word in the English language
B	yeah it is
A	erm do you know what if I say this okay so your vocabulary is exponential
B	er it grows as I go along
A	mm mm
B	you're talking about fucking basic words like
A	to be fair my friend
B	yeah but like you say
A	yeah I mean I have a list
A	if I come across a word like I put it down and then like look up look at it later like I have this app and it on my phone and it basically gives me five new words a day to learn
B	oh right
A	so like every day five new words'll come up and if they're already in my vocabulary if I already know what they mean I click on them and say I know what these mean and give me some more
B	do you do what I do and when you say a big word you smirk?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and like
A	and then they're confused
B	really is a lot of them in music as well because obviously it's like an extra subject to do something you've never really done
A	yeah
B	I could sit here saying all sorts of words to you and you won't have a clue what I'm on about
A	yeah
B	and really basic ones as well so for basic for me would be saying like a you know the song Don't Look Back In Anger by Oasis yeah?
A	yeah
B	that song is in a key of C that's fairly understandable yeah?
A	mm
B	and it uses a chord progression on the one four five six with a
B	I can fill you full of bullshit all day and you wouldn't know it's
A	oh my god
B	but it is pretty cool to know music because now I'm at a point where I can listen to a song and by the end of the song I've already learnt it all apart from the words cos obviously I need to remember the words
A	yeah
B	but if it's something like a song any any pop song I can pretty much know by the end of it because they're all common
A	yeah they all use the same music notes alright
B	chord progressive
A	yeah chord progressive
A	so
B	ah
A	so do you know erm how to play any instrument or is it just guitar or drums or what?
A	cos it all
B	it sort of yes I don't know how to play a trumpet or trombone cos they're all you have to have skill
A	yeah
B	the way you get a chord it's like getting three trumpets to play all at the same time you don't want a third a third of the fifth of chord on a different note
A	okay right
B	yeah
A	same sort of instrument
B	yeah cymbal
A	yeah okay
B	I can play drums erm purely because one of my mates showed me how to and then you start playing like you do with anything you start playing sequences and stuff so you realise that it's not it looks like you can play on your arms like a
A	yeah
B	all you really do is count in
A	right
B	it gets really boring after this but
A	so I wouldn't be able to I probably wouldn't be able to do it then cos of my
B	possibly possibly yes cos like erm the the easier you do it the four four rock beat which is you using everything yeah it does you count four on your high hat which is the symbol yeah which is one two three four on the one you press your kick pedal
A	right
B	on three you press your
A	oh yeah if they don't have any coordination I couldn't play drums
B	yeah so well it's all about just learning it the once it's not hard it's just putting the time in to learn it and there's a thing called the ten thousand hours theory where if you put ten thousand hours into learning anything
A	yeah
B	you're good at it but you just have to put that ten thousand hours in
A	right okay keep doing it for ten thousand hours
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	or there's a theory like if you do something for twenty-seven days no matter what it is like erm if you go to the gym every day for twenty-seven days it's then in your memory in your muscle memory and everything you want to go back again so if you can stick with something for twenty-seven days chances are you can stick with it forever
A	really?
B	so if you want to do your five
A	yeah
B	and after that month you'll want to do it because it's coming
A	yeah
B	that's an interesting theory I know loads all about the theories
A	do you know anything about erm the string theory? see I have to concentrate then when I'm being serious
B	yeah
A	I have to concentrate
B	yeah
B	I was only joking about that I'm not
A	I know but I'm trying to like con my dentist into thinking that I need a brace for free because
B	now I've got
A	that's what I'm trying to
A	well yeah thick thick
B	in the English degree
A	like I I actually have to concentrate like saying things like thick or three or erm
B	yeah but
A	yeah
B	so you don't have to like express every
A	I know but like I'm trying to get a free brace here so
B	go on then try me
A	I can't do it now you're from Yorkshire but like some people who are like on the outskirts of Yorkshire or say like I don't know from the south and things like that they don't understand a word that I'm saying because I speak so fast and when I've had a drink oh my god like when I'm drunk I'm like
B	you know I think you know from what I can gather you're very similar to me yeah and I think I've tried to like self-diagnose over the years and what I think it is people always look at me like I'm being a dick when I say like er it's not that
B	when people whenever I've said that people are like oh do you think you're clever do you? well it's like no no no I think what you'll find is my mouth is just stupid
A	yeah
B	so well I'm thinking things too quick and my mouth can't keep up with the thought I think
A	same with me yeah
B	but you'll say things and occasionally you'll see me go er da da da da da da da da da and then I'll get into the speech cos I'm trying and my brain's
A	it comes out yeah it's the same with me though because sometimes say I'll be sat here and will not have said anything for five minutes just watching telly or whatever and I'll sit I'll oh yeah so you know this and blah blah blah and people are just like what the fuck are you talking about? I'm like yeah this and I've not realised that I've not said it cos it's been going through my brain
B	I get that all the time
A	but I'm not
B	but in your mind it's so clear what you're on about
A	yeah I mean it's like why do you not know yeah
B	you know exactly what you're on about and you're like how are you not getting it?
A	yeah how do you not get this? it's like and I get and I'm really impatient so I get pissed off with people how the fuck do you not know what I'm talking about? like seriously and then they're like so thick you start a conversation like this like oh okay it's my fault sorry
B	you you
A	but I like everyone
B	this is gold by the way
A	I know
A	yeah balloon
B	ah
A	ah some little kid's lost it
B	there's nothing sadder than an escaped balloon is there?
A	no
A	yeah
B	it goes up to the atmosphere and it blows up
B	yeah
A	you know birds keep flying into our windows? we just had new windows fitted cos
B	mm
A	while the window fitters were there and then going back and erm but birds keep flying into it and dying and it's so sad
A	because like
B	hilarious to watch though
A	I know it's hilarious but like it's so sad because I think well I want to get my windows cleaned but I don't want to kill any more birds
A	like so I've purposefully not had
B	you're directly directly responsible
A	yeah directly responsible for all these animals dying so I'm just like right I'm not gonna get my windows cleaned so they've not been cleaned since they've been fitted and they're still ultra clean like I just don't know why
A	yeah oh god
B	as they explode on your window they're
A	well they snap their
B	really?
A	they snap their neck er they like fly into the window snap their neck and end up on the floor
B	I remember once at my house where a bird had flown through the window so it's inside my house we were
A	yeah
B	but like my dad like opened door like
B	and the bird like got like
B	stopped a pigeon from getting killed
A	I er I do you know what? pigeons are so weird though when they die I can remember when I was when I were about twelve or thirteen there were
A	there were a dead pigeon I've just realised oh karma my boyfriend chucking a brick in my face was karma for me chucking a stone in their window
B	possibly yeah
A	it was possibly karma
A	no there you go
A	well that is true probably is karma
B	I wouldn't know cos windows aren't like
A	who knows maybe they have feelings
B	maybe all windows do
A	maybe in a parallel universe
B	I broke a couple of windows in my time
A	really?
B	yeah
A	you?
B	yeah
A	what do you mean you broke
A	so you never got excluded?
B	no
A	you're not a bad boy then
B	no
A	like you stabbed someone
B	yeah yeah er which one of my mates did but yeah
B	I've been stabbed before with a pencil as well in the back of my arm
A	no it's not really stabbing though is it?
B	yeah yeah erm
A	and is there
B	oh mate
A	a fat lad I love it that's how you explain it
B	he had big
A	right
B	he tried to bite my arm he would get a bit of
A	bone
A	she said that in class?
B	summat like summat along the lines of that yeah and she was like ah so who here who here
A	a teacher said this in the class?
B	yeah and he went oh I don't know use your finger he said
B	and he got excluded for it yeah but she were like proper immature sort of teacher and because of it like they kind of let her off sort of thing but like it wasn't like it wasn't like she was being dirty or being weird she was just really stupid
A	yeah
B	so when she said it she didn't mean any harm like she was just too daft to know what exactly the repercussions of what she said what she said could be huge
B	but at the time it wasn't like that and then about two years later er this girl called
A	yeah
B	in my mind by the way this is all really clear for you you're just hearing army trip
A	yeah
B	yeah so we went on this army trip er so we got like three weeks in the army sort of thing
A	do you can I just pause you a second did you we did you used to be in the cadets?
B	no
A	what what do you mean like
B	oh it was it was with school we did like a
A	oh like a recruitment day
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	like when you do you used to see them
B	yeah we did like three weeks in it so it was like you go there
A	residential
B	they they show you how to live like a soldier like if you might want to be a soldier sort of thing
A	okay
B	erm and it were really really good it made me what to join the army for quite a while
A	so I used to be in TAs
B	right
A	and now I were a TA until I joined the army like cos I was gonna join the army but anyway carry on
B	erm so we did this and I was like I I find it really really cool and a lot of people like can't can't be ordered about and stuff I was like well
A	yeah
B	and when I were a kid I was
A	yeah
B	I couldn't do a day's work
A	you didn't have the
B	yeah so erm
A	yeah
B	it kind of sorted me out and erm and er so I run like I didn't really get much
A	yeah
B	and this other girl said oh can I borrow your phone? borrowed it off her and she went for her phone and she found loads of pictures of her being like fucked by this other guy yeah
B	and we were like we were like sixteen that's how we were like fucking hell this is heavy like send them all round yeah and I I were the first person to spot this that she said she she's like oh these pictures are like er this guy with her and I was like that's our music teacher and he were like twenty-five so he's not that old
A	no but still it's bad
B	but still older yeah yeah yeah so it's like it's like it's
A	oh my god
A	were he a small guy or like
B	he was quite a small guy yeah but he was still fisting like a sixteen-year-old girl yeah and proper all these like dirty graphic pictures and we didn't tell any of the teachers for like two weeks so when we got back we still had like one month left at school you know like the winding down period when everyone's just doing like
A	fun stuff
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	so all throughout
A	cos you finish exams in May don't ya? yeah
B	not a lot of people were in school everyone just like took days off and that we were all around it all like spreading it round and that eventually one of the teachers heard about it so she er they were going out and everything yeah but they didn't want anyone to know about it but I think he were no we can't have been sixteen cos she were underage and he got done for being a paedophile
A	really?
B	so she
A	she must have been like fifteen
B	fourteen or fifteen or something like that yeah
A	like just turning sixteen when she left school
B	I think it was up to GCSE's so I don't think we were old enough to do GCSE's yet I dunno I can't
B	remember exactly but summat like I'll Google it erm cos there were loads of shit about it and his name was
A	what school did you go to?
A	hang on
A	yeah no I remember that I saw it in erm it were a few years ago that happened but a few weeks ago it were on internet about it
B	yeah
A	and they said she was seventeen and he was twenty-one when it happened
B	no he weren't twenty-one
A	this might be a different story but it involved a car cos like she was seventeen and met her in a nightclub had sex with her
B	no yeah
A	and then everyone
B	no no that's
B	a couple of years above us
A	he should not have fucking he
B	yeah
A	he should not have got done for that
B	well
A	cos if
B	I've got no no no because if you hear the other side of the story cos obviously I went to that school
A	so I only read it in the paper
B	I know a load of people from school I've hear all sorts of different accounts yeah from what I can gather is that he helped put her in a class cos I know who it was it was a girl called
A	I don't know
B	sister of a
A	right
B	so they both kind of went off the rails a bit but kind of went you know like if summat like that happened if you
A	yeah yeah you lose your fucking head don't ya? yeah
B	basically yeah so
A	yeah
B	so she so she's always looking for
A	for yeah
B	erm so he's gone for a night out he's gone to pull a bird not specifically her or whatever
A	yeah
B	but he's bumped into her and like said oh how you doing oh yeah so he knows her and that he knows that she's underage he knows that she's seventeen
A	so he knew then
B	yeah but
A	oh right fair
B	but the thing is is that when you're a teacher there's no need to put yourself in that situation
A	no
B	people saying like she's not underage or it's not wrong which I agree with but it's an abuse of trust because you're put in er a position of power over that student
A	yeah
B	you can you can get
A	yeah you do yeah you do
A	why did you
A	see I
B	live in
A	fucking hell really? cos I thought you were from like my end like
B	no
A	I don't know why I thought that? I thought you were either from
B	two thousand and ten aged twenty-seven he was
A	really?
B	yeah
A	so he had child porn like what do you mean child porn? like
B	yeah like pictures of young girls getting fucked and stuff
A	yeah but how old young girls like
B	child porn is under sixteen innit?
A	like I know but like there's child porn cos at fifteen like
B	he was but I'm not defending him he was always a very immature teacher so like he was he was never really a proper teacher he was always like a sub teacher sort of thing
A	he was just like a
B	he would always be he would always be in the class but with another teacher as well so
A	oh so like an LSA sort of thing
B	yeah yeah sort of like that but he wasn't he wasn't a teacher but he was never left on his own sort of thing
A	right okay
B	or like erm she like the
A	yeah
B	she'd have to take control but when she didn't he'd be like screaming at us and trying to put be really immature about it trying to get us under control but we were like fuck you mate like like you
A	yeah because you can you can smell you can smell it can't you? like
B	yeah yeah you can tell exactly
A	you can tell when someone you can fuck about with them
B	but the girl obviously they're not gonna name her but the girl was called
B	very interesting
A	I'm gonna steal your phone now
B	it's very interesting yeah and at the time it blew all our minds cos it we were like fuck me like we know this guy quite well she was always he was like a quite nerdy guy
B	but my mate
A	yeah as you would a teenager
A	so what does he do now then?
B	dunno I'll I'll get
A	I can't fucking believe that
B	there you go
A	oh like look there
B	that's him is it?
A	that'll be her dad it looks like her dad
B	that's her dad
A	dad
B	that's him
A	oh they're both ugly as fuck aren't they?
A	he looks like a paedophile to be fair
B	yeah but he obviously you can tell he's immature can't ya?
A	yeah
B	and er yeah
A	fucking hell
A	shit
B	I think she moved school in sixth form or summat which you would
A	of course of course she would if if like you know if everyone knew what had going were going on cos they would wouldn't they? cos like everyone's
B	oh there you go that's that's er that's from our
A	egg on her face
B	yeah
A	yeah but you think you know someone don't you then something like that comes out and it's like
B	no one knew about it no one knew about it and I can honestly say
A	until
B	I was there when we found out yeah because er it was
A	see I know this sounds really bad and you can't judge me for it but when I was fifteen right when you're fifteen years old or sixteen or fourteen or thirteen as soon as you become a teenager soon as you like start your period and start noticing boys and start having all that shit with your parents where you're a teenager you don't give a fuck what they think they're wrong you hate your parents like you think that you are old enough to make decisions you you become a teenager you hit puberty and then all of a sudden you are adult enough to make your own decisions and your parents telling you you're like fuck off you're wrong
B	yeah yeah
A	I'm right you know better right? when I were fifteen if I'd have slept with a guy who was twenty-one twenty-two whatever whatever
B	yeah
A	it wouldn't phase you you wouldn't think oh he's a paedophile he's taking advantage of me but since
B	yeah but
A	since
B	getting with
A	it is it is a power of trust I get that I understand that and what he did was wrong but if you look at say like you go to I don't know erm Pakistan and I hate being stereotypical because it's pretty racist but if you go to places like Pakistan or any Muslim country or any Indian country so anyone who follows the Sikh religion to them it's normal to get
B	yes
A	and the men are always older
B	it's a different culture it's a different culture but I I think the
A	but why is that not wrong?
B	I think the age of consent should er be especially in England should be about eighteen or
A	yeah it should
B	you don't you don't cos I'm older now and I've done all that I realise that when I were eighteen I weren't thinking I weren't thinking clearly at all
A	yeah but no one ever
B	at eighteen I'd of shagged I'd of shagged
A	no one ever I know but
B	nowadays it's not the same is it?
A	nothing sake nothing takes like I I've slept with people who are older than me like my ex boyfriend was twenty-four and I were eighteen
B	yeah
A	I know but er and
B	yeah
A	like you could turn round and say well he's older than you so he should know better he shouldn't be sleeping with you but
A	exactly but what difference does it make? age it's just a number and but then you think well actually if it were my child my daughter my son whatever you wouldn't want them you wouldn't want them to do that and it's and the whole thing with Jimmy Savileand erm loads of other people like that's come out in this Yewtree enquiry and all that fucking bullshit like what where do you draw the line because there's fifteen year olds and there's nine year olds there's a big difference between nine and fifteen
B	it's a very grey area because
A	it's so weird
B	because some of it is hard to
A	yeah like it were consent it were consentful
B	and Mick Jagger
A	no
B	but these the the where it differs with the Jimmy Savilething and he was going up to seventeen-year-old girls
A	oh yeah Jimmy Savilewere a cunt he he was
B	he were groom he were grooming them
A	grooming them
B	yeah yeah
A	I get that but my point is like you know Cliff Richard
B	yeah
A	he's recently been had his home searched in December on Christmas Day my my grandad is like a political political
B	three dads
A	three dads
B	three birthday presents
A	erm no
A	so my real dad fucked off when he found out my mum were pregnant with me my mum married my sister's dad her childhood sweetheart when she were pregnant with me his name went on my birth certificate then my mum had my sister my mum caught him with another woman on her settee shagging naked whatever so she left him and then met my dad
B	yeah
A	almost straight away now my dad is not my dad or my sister's dad but he's brought us up
B	been been a dad to you
A	he's been a dad to me and he was young he's six years younger than my mum so his
B	yeah but they're not they're not really grandparents
A	no
B	but they are more grandparents than you've ever known anyway
A	yeah exactly so we call them by their names because they were always too young to call nanna and grandad
B	yeah
A	because they were in their like forties when my mum and dad met
B	yeah
A	so we always call them
B	yeah yeah
A	how the government are fucking us over and all this sort of shit and erm he said to me at Christmas said ah we were talking about like
B	oh right yeah
A	so they'd have two get ups they'd have the one where you sign your real name and the one where you'd sign a fake name
B	yeah yeah
A	and basically what they'd do there were a boys' school next door and these he'd get these boys over pay them money or whatever so that these paedophiles could come and shag them
B	yeah
A	and be anonymous blah blah leave I know and he he was saying like ah he moved to Barbados he changed his name he's now sitting in citizen of Barbados so that he can't get extradited
B	yeah
A	blah blah blah and I'm just like you're talking fucking shit I never said that to him but I was like you're talking shit Cliff Richard is a fucking Christian you know
B	well yeah so were Jimmy Savilethough
A	blah blah blah exactly
B	Jimmy Savilewere like whiter than white
A	exactly so I was just like okay I'm just gonna take this for face value and believe what you er I'll believe whatever you want me to believe sort of thing and just tell him that and then the other week I found a news article saying that Cliff Richard's Berkshire home had been searched about the South Yorkshire thing so I instantly put it on my grandad's profile on Facebook
B	I bet he were laughing going
A	and he and I know like and he said to me like oh my little private PI
B	yeah
A	and I was just like well you were right and that
B	it's really interesting
A	it is so weird innit?
B	it's really interesting yeah the only problem I have with it is once your tarred with that brush it never goes away
A	do you know what? I really fucking hate I really fucking hate the fact that say like all these people out of Coronation Street erm Ken erm that other guy? erm
B	Michael Le Vell
A	Michael Le Vell they all got they all got said they all got told you're a paedophile
B	yeah
A	erm they got all these reports it's not proven it's shit
B	it shouldn't be even a report
A	your name should not be in the paper until you're found guilty
B	yeah yeah
A	because
B	it's not fair is it?
A	because the thing is now
B	no it's William Roache who plays Ken
A	William Roache yeah that's it who plays Ken
B	Ken Barlow
A	Barlow
B	that's who it is Ken Dodd
A	where the fuck have I got Dodd from?
B	Kev Le Vell
A	Kev Le Vell
B	yeah
A	like if anyone says their name now like oh
A	Michael
B	he plays Kevin
A	Michael
A	who plays Kevin I don't watch it so I don't know but like as soon as someone mentions their name
B	you think straight away
A	yeah
B	you think oh yeah that guy who were a paedophile or something like that
A	yeah and they're not guilty
B	no
A	it's all shit
B	yeah
A	it should it should not be reported on something that serious until they've been found guilty
B	they don't they don't they don't report it unless they're pretty sure yeah but they're pretty sure there's always there's always a margin for error sort of thing
A	yeah but can I just say something you can either sell a
B	sells papers don't it?
A	it sells papers
B	yeah
A	and what the fuck do the media care about it?
A	nothing as long as it's gonna sell their papers
B	you ruin someone's life so what yeah yeah
A	but how much is
A	okay go on
B	that was brilliant
A	paedophiles woo
