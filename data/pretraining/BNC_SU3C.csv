A	yeah
B	is moving into a house two doors away from
B	mum and dad
A	and where do they live? where are her mum and dad?
A	oh
B	two doors away now it's either
A	oh no
B	either a tactic whereby he'll be able to see the girls coming and going and visiting so perhaps it's his opportunity to or I just don't know but
A	cos she
B	who would be that cruel?

B	no but very definitely moving today
A	well yes cos I passed the removal van today
B	and
A	what the new the new buyers?
B	the new people moving into this one they wanted to knock twelve thousand pound off the agreed price
A	mm
B	and the lawnmower that they were buying from them for two grand they wanted it just thrown in and if they didn't agree then the sale was would fall through
A	what at the last minute? is it one of those sit-on mowers?
B	yeah
A	well it would be for two grand wouldn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	did they well did they agree?
B	I think they've had to well they must have done
A	they
B	seven hundred and
A	you're not gonna quibble over a two grand mower are you if you've got that much money? I wouldn't have thought

B	she's having problems with it it's not been right since it's been done
A	oh
B	but to be fair there is quite a
A	yes
B	know what I mean? but she's had it recently looked at and it looks like it's a possibility it's disjointed itself in some way so she's gonna have to potentially have another operation yeah? she had an appointment for next Tuesday I think to go with the consultant
A	mm
B	so the private insurance she's been enjoying
A	has gone
B	no longer exists so now she's got to go through

B	of course and said it's gonna be because of her treatment isn't it? because of her breast cancer
A	yeah yes
B	would have sort of so she thought
A	how old is she?
B	is she a couple of years younger than me?
A	cos some of the treatment for erm cancer puts you into early menopause
B	yeah
A	doesn't it?
B	well she said she went through menopause when she was forty-two
A	gosh that's early
B	so she must be forty-seven
A	gosh
B	but I think part of that was
A	it was from the
B	the
A	the the
B	cos we laughed about it and then said
A	is it the radiotherapy or something?
B	it's gonna be because of your
A	yes yeah
B	your treatment isn't it for your breast cancer? and she said yeah
A	mm
B	but she suddenly had a period from out of the blue
A	gosh

A	oh really?
B	erm but she went for a blood test just before Christmas and
A	everything's alright let's hope so I haven't seen her haven't even seen her about the village actually
B	mm
A	I haven't passed her so I don't know but
B	cos she cleans up at school now she's like
A	oh does she?
B	the cleaning supervisor so she comes down to do duty
A	mm
B	goes back and then around three o'clock she's back for cleaning till about six
A	oh right
B	so she's not about much at the
A	oh right
B	walking the dog
A	but I haven't seen her so I can't
B	yeah
A	but
B	she's lost a lot of weight
A	oh dear well let's hope she's alright too
B	I know
A	blinking heck we need some good news
B	I know
B	what oh what good news have I got? what good news? oh
A	oh don't be silly
B	we had one day
A	did you?
B	well we ended up going to
A	mm
B	which I'll tell you about and dad ended up coming to us for two separate days
A	oh did he have a nice time?
B	he had a lovely time
A	did he? oh good he went to your brother's?
B	he went down on the Monday for the show and I said
A	yes
B	look you're you're choosing to spend Christmas with
A	no no
B	you might as well enjoy the week
A	yeah yeah
B	treat it as a holiday cos you haven't had one for a long time of course
A	no
B	erm treat it as a holiday so he said yeah you're right cos actually I've come back on Tuesday and then I'll be going back Wednesday wouldn't I? so we ended up coming back the following Monday so we did have a
A	oh so he did have a long erm
B	good full week yeah and he had a nice time
A	oh good
B	then we had arranged to go to cos
A	yeah
B	we come and visit and
A	oh lovely
B	and I'll do some tea and all this and that
A	yes yeah
A	what where er where does she live? where in
B	do you know where erm
A	yes
B	you know that?
A	yeah yeah
B	kind of at the back
A	oh okay
B	of there
A	oh
B	lovely house erm
A	really? oh good
B	semi-detached pre-war you know proper solid build erm think they paid about a hundred and forty thousand pound for it but I've since learned had a conversation with somebody at the hospital yesterday who was grew up in
A	mm
B	didn't go to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	okay
B	and she was saying how it's like an academy status and it's one of something like five
A	right
B	a really sought after school
A	oh so the and are they in
B	and the prices have rocketed
A	the catchment for it? oh
B	yeah
A	gosh yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so they've paid about
A	I was gonna say that sounds good actually hundred and forty for a semi-detached house that
B	yeah I suppose it is really
A	it is yeah
B	I think I I
A	oh good
B	decorated the lounge and the dining room and painted the kitchen the kitchen cupboards will need replacing eventually but they're absolutely fine at the moment
A	mm
B	erm but it's what they've done is it was two rooms knocked into one room plus an extension
A	right
B	and then it's open plan round to the kitchen
A	okay
B	so she said although it's lovely there's no doors to go through as such when the washing machine is on
A	on you can hear it
B	or the dishwasher
A	or the kettle
B	yeah
A	and the smells from the cooking
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so she's
A	that's the only downside to open plan
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so they are thinking that eventually perhaps they'll partition I said to her if I were you I'd do your partition from here so you've got a nice
A	trust you to go in
A	trust you to go in
B	so it let's have a look let's have a like
B	I'd go from here I said because then you've got your door your existing door and you've got a nice cosy but good-sized lounge
A	yeah
B	I said and you've still got enough room this side for your table and er like a a lounger or something so in the day
A	yeah yeah
B	particularly when children come along and
A	oh there's you planning ahead as usual
B	she's like oh l like that idea auntie
A	mm
B	she said but I like that actually cos we could do glass doors so you
A	yes
B	still get the light
A	still yes
B	and the views
A	yeah
B	but when you're in your lounge at night you're in your lounge at night
A	mm
B	but that will come
A	yeah oh yes
B	they've got quite a bit they want to do
A	oh that's handy
B	and one of those roll top baths with the legs
A	oh lovely
B	so that looks really really lovely and a separate shower and that's all very lovely erm
A	how many bedrooms is it?
B	three bedrooms
A	oh room for a little family
B	yes
B	the very small bedroom is very small
A	right
B	erm you'd be lucky to get er er a bed and a tiny wardrobe in it really
A	oh okay
B	and they managed
A	and they managed
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you do don't you?
A	course you do yeah
B	so erm so yeah so their their plans are to do the hall stairs and landing then the three bedrooms theirs first they've got about nine strips of
A	oh
A	trouble is
B	behind me
A	the longer you the longer you leave them up the more your sort of change your mind don't you?
B	I know I know
B	so yeah so
A	oh that's exciting
B	there there are all these strips of wallpaper round
A	ah
B	so it's really really lovely for them they've been there about six months now
A	mm
B	and they're oh they're so happy and in love you can tell you know
A	oh oh do you remember those days? yeah
B	oh
A	oh I've still got it actually cos I've I've
B	I've kept it
A	recycled all the Christmas cards but I can't I
B	well I've got erm
A	oh for for
B	I used it for the Christmas cards
A	yes yes
B	so I used that again this year and er what I've done instead of putting it away cos I've got a couple of cards where I like the pictures and I've got a card I had off
A	yes yeah
B	thought oh I'll use that
A	I'll reuse that that's a good idea
B	instead of putting it away and I've I've trimmed
A	oh okay
B	and I've put that one in
A	ah
B	because it it I look at it and it's
A	oh yeah they just look so happy
B	oh
A	and that little baby was so good over Christmas
B	yeah mm
A	I said
B	oh well I said to pops oh it's Christmas
A	pops
B	well I used to call him grandad but he tells me he's pops
A	pops I know

B	yeah
A	and he had his Santa's you know er my first Christmas outfit
B	ah
A	and I thought well there's an outfit you're only gonna wear one day

B	have you got a tissue
A	oh yeah yeah let me go and grab you one

A	oh were you?
B	yeah when I went to cos I
B	child psychology course
A	yeah
B	and I had to give it up cos I was doing too much as usual
A	yeah
B	thanks
A	what's she getting?
B	an A-Class
A	class Mercedes?
B	yeah
A	yeah er do you know I've seen er I've seen her this is my own niece and I haven't even I've seen her Mini on for sale on Facebook
B	have you seen? oh
A	and I knew she'd test driven a Mercedes with
B	yeah
A	but I've only seen the adverts for the Mini on Facebook this week and I haven't seen my sister or
B	oh
A	so I haven't erm asked oh
B	well he'd he'd dropped
A	so she's picked it up already?
B	she picked it up on Tuesday
A	look at me I'm so behind the times I'm gonna have to phone my sister
B	me I tell you I tell you
A	you
B	I know more than you
B	only
B	why do you need a lift
B	you know
A	well that was
B	well it's what she likes
A	the impression I got that's what cos I think
B	it's like
A	cos is it
B	gosh
A	oh I must ring so was it expensive then? because
B	I don't know
A	because
B	oh
A	so
A	so er cos of course
B	the money's gone on a car
A	she the money's gone on the car
A	so I think there's maybe a little bit of that thrown in with as you know because
A	as things are going well I am sort of trying to get her to you know thinking come on now
B	mm mm
A	but
B	is it brand new then?
A	I've
A	I didn't even know what she was getting erm
B	it was
B	no
A	don't know
B	oh I can't remember now where he had to go
B	I can't remember where he had to go
A	I don't know anything about it
B	but it was a bit of a journey
A	other than I knew she had I knew she'd test driven one before Christmas I think it was
B	she's she's had it she's had it
A	she'd had it she's selling
B	and then she
A	she's selling the Mini
B	she can't sell a Mini erm apparently they will they will you know there's
A	oh they take it as a
B	that can go back yeah
A	oh okay
B	yeah and they can take the
A	but erm
B	the Mini for er
A	cos she owns the Mini she didn't have any car payments on that
B	right
A	but now she's obviously I think this was the plan this was
A	that's hilarious
B	well if you can't do it when you're living at home with your parents when can you?
A	well I know but
A	I don't think
B	I think it's the average age about thirty-two now?
A	oh don't
B	when they
A	god don't them them that so oh well I'm pleased
B	oh that's why he was a bit sort of like
A	maybe
B	and I was like oh that's a bit posh
A	yeah

A	they've only had the one year anniversary it was coming up two years in May
B	it's May their anniversary?
A	yeah so that'll be two years
B	that's that's gone quick
A	I think I know I think
B	that's what I mean I'm I've got no problem

B	about giving chocolate and sweets er because it'll be equivalent to a couple of months
A	yes a year will fly past
B	it will

B	well this is the
A	so why didn't he bring her where did he
B	this
A	bring her back to?
B	well I don't know how the
A	somewhere that suited her I expect
B	you know what happened probably what's probably happened is maybe all three of them went in one car
A	mm
B	then maybe
A	maybe
B	and then she was on standby to potentially
A	to pick him up
B	pick him up but I dropped him home
A	who knows? yes yeah
B	but she wasn't home anyway
B	said she might be at home and we pulled round the corner and went no she's not
A	no she's not
A	she'll be out driving in her new car
B	oh
A	so was the Mini still on the drive?
B	no the Mini wasn't there
A	cos they've always got far too many cars on their drive and outside their house
B	there was only
A	oh you'd hate to live there
B	is there always lots of cars then?
A	well there's usually five or six
B	can't they widen their drive?
A	well they've widened it they did widen it years ago so that they could fit three on when
B	yeah
A	had cars but then they always had boyfriends round it was not uncommon
B	mm
A	for them to be six cars there and like on a Sunday if we went or mum and dad went
B	yeah
A	you know you these
B	is she?
B	oh I know where
A	oh probably

A	it's so cos
A	I'm not changing the TT
B	so how did Christmas Day go?
A	oh it was lovely we had a really nice Christmas
B	did you? cos cos I did think of you er well I thought more of
A	do you know he coped
B	I know he was quite you know wanted
B	to be doing the cooking
A	to be doing the cooking
B	did he take over in the kitchen?
A	he helped he helped
B	but so he
A	he
B	he
A	yes
A	so we had cos we had oh you didn't we had there were sixteen of us on Christmas Eve in the end here
B	sixteen?
A	it
B	who were all those people?
A	well there was us four
B	mum
A	obviously there was er
B	and
A	and baby
B	yes
A	and
B	yeah
A	over and then we invited
B	oh
A	so there was sixteen of us so we had food and drinks and we had a really lovely evening it was so nice but we'd started early like sort of half six and so by about half ten quarter to eleven people were going cos obviously Christmas Day is a big
B	yeah
A	you know you've got a lot to do people had gone so we
B	oh at our church?
A	haven't been to midnight mass and I don't know how well for years and years
B	was it did the boys go with you?
A	but we yeah they didn't want to but we did make them
B	yeah
A	the church was packed
B	really?
A	how often do you go in that little church and it's packed? never
B	and who took it?
A	er no what's the lady called? you know the
B	oh
A	with the dark hair
B	yeah
A	I can never remember her name
B	no I don't know
A	but she did a nice service she really did so by the time that was an hour so we weren't home and in bed till quarter to one
B	oh
A	but you know we could get up on Christmas morning and we opened all our presents we had a leisurely time and then erm
B	oh
A	so anyway so we drove round there so we had the day there
A	so she said well obviously I would but you know it's much harder work isn't it?
A	I said well yeah
A	she said she said oh I'd forgotten how hard it was
B	I think as time goes on it might be that
A	of course they will
B	want their own Christmas Days or
A	or well they were
B	just their mum and dad maybe or whatever
A	she
B	mm
A	but erm I'm hoping you know with
B	yeah
A	you know I think

A	you know so
B	ah no well
A	cos it is quite warm
B	am I looking red?
A	no you're not
B	I was gonna say I'm not having one
A	but it is quite warm
A	it is quite warm
B	I'm gonna have a look at this
A	but no so it was lovely it was really nice really and I would
B	oh I've done
A	easily do it that way round again
B	yeah
A	I mean it's been
B	ours was lovely and leisurely
A	it's been lovely having you know Christmas Day here for the last ten years but it is hard work isn't it?
B	mm
A	when you're cooking for twelve people or whatever
B	it's not until you have the opposite that you realise
A	yeah
B	because it becomes the norm
A	yes yes
B	until there's a change and then you suddenly think actually that has been really nice
A	mm it was cos I mean you know we always have a nice time we still manage to get across to the
B	mm
A	and went ice skating not tobogganing this year and erm
B	did you ice skate?
A	no I didn't no
B	mm
B	mm
A	but erm anyway anyway but it yes it was nice but we weren't erm we weren't rushed it was lovely actually I could do with
B	mm
B	mm yeah that's why I've never really been that keen on going or having people
A	having lots of people no
B	on Christmas Day particularly when
A	when they were small yeah
B	of course cos you go at their speed with the presents
A	yeah yeah
B	they wanna play with things
A	yeah
B	I've never like today where I've never wanted to feel pressured
A	no
B	by time or

A	yeah he used his debit card
B	did he?
A	on the internet
B	mm
A	and that
B	tell him to be careful
A	I know had it delivered and so this box arrived I said
A	nothing at all I don't want any part of it and I said what on earth has he got us?
A	I'm not telling you but it's nothing to do with me I said oh and you know when you're thinking what what is it?
B	what is it?
A	what
B	that he wants to be excluded from?
A	that he exactly so of course on Christmas Day we open these bells they're in the wrong ones there's wine ring for
B	oh
A	ring for wine oh and do you know we had such fun with it and he was so good and we'd be going
A	and he just came back down yeah mum yeah I'll get your wine what would you like? he was so good with it
B	oh bless him
A	he was so good but erm one one for beer one for wine and I just thought it was best gifts gift ever and
B	well I hope you used them
A	oh I did
B	yes
A	oh I absolutely you know me
B	when he's had enough I I might have to have a quiet word with him but you haven't heard this conversation next time I see him I'll mention that I
A	oh
B	one that says
A	ring
A	yeah yeah
B	that's a good idea
A	oh but no it was brilliant
B	no very good
A	I did laugh it really made my I thought that's a brilliant gift
B	and you had a good
A	perfect
B	a good laugh too
B	sometimes you know the most I mean I'm not saying it's simple in a disrespectful way
A	oh yeah no no it was
B	it's it's the simplest of things can have so much fun
A	he was really pleased with it he said mum I've got a present for you and dad and postage and it was under a tenner
B	and the thought that's gone into that
B	do you know what I mean? it is very relevant isn't it
A	very relevant in this household
B	very relevant
A	yeah very relevant a nice glass of wine
B	so the thought that's gone into it
A	I know
B	is lovely isn't it? and brought so much enjoyment
A	it was just so funny cos for a few days I was thinking what on earth is it? that
B	it's a bit worrying
A	it was
B	I can understand why he doesn't want to be
A	oh I ended buying it myself when we went to the
B	well I helped
A	oh
B	I said you could pay for that okay he said and then I came back from
A	oh yes yeah
B	that
B	some the what
A	oh the symphony one
B	the
A	oh
B	it's
A	is it?
B	absolutely brilliant
A	I'd I
B	it's
A	I watched the thing with
B	yeah
A	Joanna Lumley on the the documentary did you see it?
B	oh I didn't see that no
A	oh I quite enjoyed it
B	well I'd heard about it on the radio as you do
A	mm
B	and forgotten about it and then I was driving home one day coming up the A38 and the Fever track came on where he's singing with Michael Bublé and I just thought oh that is just
A	how amazing
A	mm
B	and introduced another artist
A	okay
B	and you know when you're a bit like this is a real surreal moment? this is like my god this is what we can do now with technology
A	yeah yes yeah
B	so that was sort of my first hearing of it you see and I'm like oh the volume goes up as you do and I'm listening and everything and erm so then from that cos I'd heard about the stripping back and introducing the symphony orchestra I said I'll have that Elvis CD oh it's lovely there's a couple of tracks on there that are not my favourite
A	yeah
B	but it's
A	yeah
B	still lovely
A	oh I haven't heard any of them
B	to hear the way they've done it
A	but I had heard about what they were doing
B	have to have a listen google it
A	yes I will
B	and then off
B	I know I couldn't have told you the following day
A	did she like her wetsuit?
B	oh yes
B	she had it on for about fifteen minutes she said oh
A	what on Christmas Day?
B	well she tried it on of course
A	mind you it was very wet
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	gone out
A	it didn't stop raining did it?
B	that's true
B	erm and so she put it on said oh that looks really good and er said I'm gonna have to take it off look I'm getting so hot
B	cos it's her winter one so it's
A	yes
B	quite warm
A	yeah
B	no she's very pleased with the wetsuit it's now hanging in the garage waiting for a holiday
A	waiting for the summer to come round yeah
B	yes
A	ah
B	but it's what she wanted isn't it?
A	yes absolutely
B	and erm
A	and you can't remember what she gave you?
B	oh do you know I can't
A	mm
B	it's really bad isn't it?
B	oh no he got that a while ago
A	oh did he?
B	he got that when I changed mine
A	oh
B	oh it's hilarious he's got this Iphone and as soon as he walks in the house
A	he does not?
B	he
B	the problem with
A	you know that i things aren't supposed to be switched on and off really
B	the problem with
A	yeah
B	he'd had it for years
A	yeah
B	the keys wasn't working properly
A	turning the computer on yeah
B	and warming it up
B	and all the rest of it but he he doesn't use it to its full full potential
A	oh cos that
A	cos they
B	oh
A	said yeah he was texting
B	oh
A	and you know
B	oh
A	so
A	oh I don't like that
B	oh how funny
A	and
B	ah
B	no no it was when we er
A	but it was just er
B	when we
B	ducked out of them before Christmas Day
A	oh puts it in a cupboard
B	oh but I still can't erm I don't know why even need to well would I go back to Tesco's or would I contact BT? but I on my BT
A	yes
B	address I cannot clear the emails
B	so delete
A	on the phone?
B	yeah can't delete them
A	yeah
B	and I can't send an email
A	I think I'd go to
B	I'm obviously receiving but I
A	yeah I'd go to Tesco
B	if I
A	to the phone shop
B	shall I?
A	I think it's something to do with the phone
B	cos my
A	do everything you need to
B	and send
A	yeah
B	but not with my BT but my my IT men looked at my BT one
A	yeah
B	and thought it was very strange because what happens you get your email from Waitrose you know
A	yeah
B	twenty percent off which I never even look at I just get rid of and then when my phone refreshes my emails ping
A	oh they're all still there?
B	it comes back
A	yes you
B	they're all there
A	yes yeah yeah no I would maybe go back to Tesco
B	well I'm gonna
A	and ask them
B	mm I'm gonna fly by the IT department again on Monday
A	mm
B	before our meeting erm cos he
A	right
B	email address and I wasn't
A	oh okay
B	so he
A	right
B	and I'll see how long it takes to come through well it was there within less than
A	oh yeah so it's it's it's the BT one that's not
B	so I said
A	BT
B	BT erm I'm in the office Monday shall I fly by?
A	I'd go to Tesco first because there's somebody there
B	I don't know why
A	there you can talk to er
B	yeah
A	whereas BT you've got to do it on the phone and it's a pain isn't it? mm
B	oh started well
A	we're having a a nightmare we did you did did
B	no
A	he'd saved up some of it it was some birthday money and some of his paper round money and he saved up and he bought himself a Hugo Boss watch very nice
B	wow
A	hundred and sixty pounds he spent but that's fine that's what he wanted you know what kids are like today he he searched and searched and searched on the internet and he found the one he wanted so I ordered it for him and he gave me the money and it was the Watch Shop and they said they'd deliver it to us or that we could pick it up from a Goldsmith jewellers and I said well we'll pick it up
B	oh dear
A	and you know how the you know how these watches they have both sides?
B	yeah
A	just wouldn't close so we took it back to Goldsmiths and she said oh no that's not catching is it? she said I'll send it back for you so they sent it back so we had an email saying they've received it etcetera etcetera and then erm an email came from the Watch Shop that said
B	mm
A	would be wear and tear I said but this is three weeks old that's not
B	no
A	fit for purpose that's not reasonable
B	no
A	erm and then they came back with yeah we understand that you're disappointed with our response we're prepared to go fifty-fifty so it's twenty-four pounds ring this number and then we'll get it and pay and we'll get it repaired this is our final offer and
B	you're very good
A	well I googled it first of
B	yeah
A	picked it up when all the rest so all within thirty days so I said
B	yeah
A	it's not
B	yeah
A	you know twenty-four quid it's nothing is it in the scheme of things? nothing and
B	yeah yeah
A	claim or whatever and erm so that was just before Christmas it was close to Christmas I think it was the twenty-second didn't oh no on the it said the template letter that we used off their website said you know you've got thirty days to respond to this but in the email I had said I would appreciate it if you could just email me back and acknowledge receipt of this email but they didn't so I emailed again on the twenty-ninth copied you know the same thing said again you've got thirty days to respond I just want to know that you've received it nothing so I phoned them up
B	Friday
A	and you can't speak to the people in escalations they only deal with email I said well that's not really good enough so cos they're not responding to my emails anyway sure enough literally five seconds after I'd kicked off on the phone five minutes later the email comes through with their response exactly the same
B	it sounds to me like
A	well
B	and I walk through the door tomorrow
A	door
B	and they sell me that very watch?
A	who knows?
B	cos they're trying to get rid of it
A	I know it's
B	mm
A	and then we'd have to go to the small claims court and go down that route what a hassle I just said to
B	it's disgraceful
A	it is disgraceful and luckily every time we've phoned the Citizens Advice they said well you know this new consumer rights act has come in to help consumers in this type of situation you do have thirty days
B	can you not just ask to speak
B	to a senior manager? just phone up and speak to a senior manager or print off every form of correspondence and on the first page highlight the date and the highlight the date
A	mm
B	on the last page so they can see it's within a certain
A	yeah
B	with a covering letter
A	and send it off
B	to these the most
A	yeah
B	senior manager of the group and say if this is appalling
A	appalling it's absolutely shocking
B	appalling
A	I know it is shocking
B	you know for a young lad
A	yes
B	who has saved his money
A	and I'm annoyed
B	and made this purchase
A	because
B	himself
A	I know
B	and this you know it is a
A	it's appalling
B	this is unfortunately a an experience for him
A	I know it's just
B	that
A	gonna turn into a saga when they first said no
B	I would just send it to senior management
A	ment
B	recorded delivery
A	I need to find it I need to find who to send it to to be honest that's the trouble with these
B	so where's The Watch?
A	I should have
B	so how did you order it?
A	he ordered it on I ordered it
B	online
A	I should have paid on my credit card I always pay
B	yeah
A	on my credit card and I
B	that's why I said
A	oh I know yes
B	on his debit card
A	I know that but but if you pay on your credit card the credit card company would be fighting this now and I always do
B	yeah
A	but it was because
B	yeah
A	was working and he was gonna pay me back and I thought do you know what? I'll take it out of my account he's gonna give me that
B	yeah
A	I was segmenting the finances and of course with Christmas and everything and my credit
B	but no it's not your fault not
A	no it's not
B	not at all not because you've paid through that method rather than your usual
A	no I know no no no I don't mean it's my fault
B	yeah
A	I just mean we could have resolved it a bit more easily
B	so you ordered it online and then picked it up from this
A	from Goldsmiths in
B	yeah
A	which is a reputable jeweller
B	it is
A	and that's who we took it back cos they changed the link took the link out
A	and made it smaller for him
B	so it's gone from there to their workshop?
A	so it's gone oh so we had to take it back into Goldsmiths and they returned it to the Watch Shop who said to us it goes back to the manufacturer for the repair which is Hugo Boss part of me thinks should er should we is there maybe we could ring
B	no just phone Hugo Boss or something
A	Hugo Boss and say is this er
B	just I
A	or do you know how the Watch Shop has er?
B	I'd collate it all into a file I'd ask
A	mm
B	the
A	yeah
B	manager or Hugo Boss and and I'd highlight the fact that that the reputation
A	reputation absolutely
B	that they are they are being given
A	that one of their retailers yes
B	by one of their retailer
A	mm I know
B	he's a young boy he's influential in the marketplace
A	yeah oh yeah
B	to spread the word
A	yeah oh yeah
B	you know and and you are giving them an opportunity to correct this
A	yeah
B	and highlighting
A	I mean
B	how their
A	part of me thinks that Hugo Boss probably are not aware of it at all
B	no
A	it probably hasn't even got to them
B	I I'd just go straight to the top
A	yeah
A	it's so frustrating though
B	with a
A	yeah
B	and the and and all their replies the same
A	same yes
B	same reply
A	perhaps I will do actually
B	yeah
A	but perhaps I will do
B	and I'd just do bullet point highlights a young boy
A	mm
B	the reputation this particular company is giving
A	yes
B	you know you
A	yeah it's so oh so frustrating
B	and I'd
A	but you know when you just think oh god
B	you just don't need it do you?
A	you just don't need the hassle can't be bothered
B	no no but it's disgraceful
A	it is disgraceful and I you know I as like I said right at the start
B	or I'd even go back to the
A	where at Goldsmiths?
B	their manager at the shop
A	I
B	you know just going to just go straight to Hugo Boss
A	yeah perhaps I'll do that next
B	yeah
A	job for Monday but it's such a pain you know?
B	you don't need it do you?
A	you don't and he only had it for
B	all the washing and the ironing
B	that's enough
A	three weeks and he hasn't had it for ages
B	such a shame such a shame
A	I don't know he doesn't have much luck with his expensive items dropped his phone in the sea didn't he after he'd had it?
B	you know when you think
A	yeah
B	he's winding it up one day and the whole thing
A	oh did it?
B	broke the the chain type thing erm
A	oh
B	I said why is it always
A	always
B	got to be
A	yeah
B	I said is he gonna go through life being one of these people
A	no
B	that are unlucky?
A	no
B	it does worry me
A	well you shouldn't worry about that
B	do you think?
A	no
B	mm
A	but er no I don't think
B	no neither have I not really
B	not really
B	part of his present was a month's insurance
A	oh was it? I said to erm
B	just just a month yeah
B	yeah he's been going out
A	yeah he's busy
B	couple of days
A	yes yeah
B	no it finishes this weekend we just got a month it was eighty-three pound I think for a month
A	oh okay
B	erm so we just did all that
A	of going out
B	yeah with
A	is it going alright?
B	absolutely fine
A	oh good
B	he's he's he's taking him on and off the A38
A	oh really?
B	parking hill starts three point
A	brilliant
B	turns you know things that he hasn't even yet done with
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	the important things and this is driving as well they drove all the way over to
A	oh brilliant
B	and you know I like last time they went out I think they just concentrated on islands
A	so has he put in for this theory test?
B	yes he's got his theory in February I may perhaps not
A	oh no no no
B	you know because it's nearer the
A	you don't no yeah no
B	but it's some the beginning of February I think
A	and then after that he can
B	thirteenth
A	put in for a test
B	second Saturday in February I think so
