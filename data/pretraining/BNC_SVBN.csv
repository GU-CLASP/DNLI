A	five fifty
B	yeah well that's okay I don't want her to sleep too long before bedtime
A	yeah
B	cos then she's
A	well do we need to go back first to put this stuff in the fridge?
B	I dunno there's only yogurts
A	well can you go for a walk like this or
B	I dunno it's a bit heavy
A	well what time did I say it was?
B	five fifty
A	five fifty?
B	yeah five zero what time is?
A	okay so we've only got an hour before she goes to bed
B	yeah I know but if she sleeps too long in
A	yeah
B	then er we'll be in trouble
A	yeah
B	she's managing to sleep longer at night
A	but she's going to bed a bit later
B	but now
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	and er
A	yeah
B	or half one even
A	mm
B	so that's an added
A	mm
B	which and she's got up at an hour later too
A	mm
B	but that's because she went to bed late
A	uhu
B	I guess
A	mm
B	she was so predictable
A	yeah
B	why was I saying that? I've forgotten
A	I don't know
B	oh cos I don't want her to sleep too long now
A	but did you get
B	but
A	sorry to change subject
B	okay
B	I don't even know what I'm talking about
A	did you get that email from
B	no
A	oh apparently The Apprentice has started in the UK again
B	yeah okay
A	I've got something to download
B	I told him I they've got good memories haven't they?
A	I think he sent it to everyone
B	oh
B	well cos they we said in I said in passing oh yeah I really like The Apprentice I like to watch that like the only thing we used to stream isn't it?
A	yeah
B	didn't we used to wait for The
A	yeah
B	erm in
A	yeah
B	we used to wait for it and go it's Apprentice night tonight
B	we used to look forward to that
B	rather than watching like a series all the way
A	yeah
B	like have something to
A	so
B	that's a bit sad isn't it?
A	cos now we've got the er now we've got the proxy
B	we should be able to watch it
A	got the oh we can't watch it live can we?
B	we can watch it
A	cos it'll be like five o'clock in the morning but
B	is it Iplayer? is it BBC One or on
A	yeah Iplayer they is erm
B	mm
A	oh no it's
B	it
A	on ITV isn't it?
B	I don't know but Iplayer's a bit shit anyway
A	yeah it's on it's got adverts hasn't it? it's on
B	oh yeah
A	erm
B	I don't know
A	I dunno actually
B	yeah but Iplayer's just so slow
A	mm
B	anything on it it's rubbish
A	well it is from here yeah
B	yeah I don't think even from here I've
A	what's that red light up there?
B	mm?
A	is it?
B	it's the yeah
A	oh it is
B	it's a camera
A	must be an infrared
B	yeah look look look the infrared camera it's switched off now
A	oh
B	did you read in the paper in erm in Plymouth they've erm they've put these signs oh no not in the
A	mm
B	helmets or hats or
B	whatever
B	did you read about that?
A	no
B	and they have but they've had to put signs up in the areas that they're allowed to wear the cameras on their hats
A	what?
B	yeah there is
A	well why would you be allowed in one area but not another?
B	because people need a sign to say you are being recorded
A	well why don't they do that?
B	cos you're not allowed it
A	with every other camera?
B	that's a good point
A	well they do have signs saying CCTV cameras
B	yeah
A	things like that
B	are working in this area yeah
A	well it is I mean you don't have a
B	if they rob a bank then they'll get caught
A	I suppose you do have a choice if you see that sign
B	you see yeah
A	that no I'm not gonna go within five miles of the city centre
B	no you're right no
A	surely
B	no cos those signs are for if you're thinking about doing something
A	no
B	you might second think yourself and go
A	yeah
B	oh well there's a camera on me I'm gonna get caught aren't I so
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	let's not do it
A	so the real reason maybe that's what they're saying but the real reason is to make people aware that that's what they're doing
B	do you reckon that they're allowed in other places?
A	well it's an incremental step to condition people into accepting that that's normal practice
B	mm
A	there you go
B	why isn't the angel lit up
A	oh they've taken them all down look
B	oh
A	tut oh
B	I thought that was gonna be up er until Christmas
A	yeah
B	oh
A	well I suppose if it's always there you don't appreciate it
B	mm
A	it is kind of nice when it gets cold to put sparkly lights up
B	yeah
B	maybe they might put them up again
A	maybe
B	or we can take our own sparkly lights out there and plug in
B	the angel
B	right are we erm walking home? or
A	that's up to you
B	walking I don't mind walking a little bit erm I like to
A	we could walk around that block like we did last time
B	we could walk around the block yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well we can walk over this bridge and then over the other bridge
B	we can't no no there's steps on the other bridges
A	is there?
B	this is the only bridge that there's no steps
A	okay
B	so you have to come back this way
A	we'll walk on the
B	yeah what? it's it's steps? we can't do steps
A	not steps
B	okay which side of the river?
A	the other side of the river
B	oh
A	yeah
B	but just to make things different we'll come back on that side of the bridge instead of that one
B	yeah this bag is quite
A	yeah
B	what on earth have you got in here?
A	I dunno
B	did did you spend twenty quid?
A	yeah
B	no it's
A	oh
B	and bleach I bought for the bathroom
A	mm
B	just for them to
A	mm
B	I'm not touching the bleach
A	so we've got a choice here
B	I hate bleach
A	we can walk down the cobbled bit
B	that's
A	we could walk on the cobbled bit now or we can walk back on the cobbled bit
B	well why don't we go up there and round there and around there and then back on
A	that's a big walk
B	okay we'll just do it let's let's just go on the cobbled bit now
A	okay
B	it's a bit wonky
A	er?
B	see I can't do this in in the other shoes
A	yeah
A	is she
B	but I like these evening walks
A	no I do
B	it's really nice around here like when it's not polluted
A	well this time of year is perfect
B	yeah it is
A	if it was like this all year
B	no I'd stay here a long time but
A	but for a few
B	yeah
A	more years
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it'll be alright
A	er
B	I'm just hoping it doesn't get too polluted over the winter
A	mm
B	we must talk about that a lot mustn't we? do you think we do?
A	I think we probably talk about a lot of the same things on these things
B	maybe
A	so it doesn't really matter
B	maybe
A	doesn't matter maybe we should start reading newspaper articles or something
B	well I was supposed to be starting I've got to download all my course er things this weekend
A	oh
B	so that's my main thing to do this weekend and I'm signed up to three course er ones and I'm signing up to the corpus one on the other learning website
A	we can turn right here
B	okay
A	mm
B	I've got loads of
A	oh well I was
B	videos to download
A	I spoke to
B	yeah
A	and she said some of the the standards
B	yeah
A	of the of the conference people were shit
B	she told me the same yeah
A	she said you know like their PPTs were just full of words
B	yeah
A	them didn't and then and then they just turn around and read it
B	where are they from?
A	all over
B	oh do we have to go down this bit?
A	the world they were
B	but I don't wanna wake her up
A	oh
B	okay shh
A	to fly to
B	yeah
A	what a piss take
B	which they've botched together
A	which they've just thrown together about some bullshit
B	mm
A	it wasn't even a study they'd done and she said
B	I think it's a bit
A	a lot of it was just
B	disgraceful really
A	yeah
B	but I don't blame everybody for jumping on the bandwagon and
B	doing it
A	so
B	to
A	yeah
B	going
A	yeah
B	for a conference and getting flown there for free
A	yeah
B	and all he's got to do is show his
A	yeah I'm thinking maybe I'd I mean it's difficult
B	we need to
A	for us though with the baby
B	yeah but the some of these conferences
A	I could do it
B	are only yeah of course yeah we
A	I mean I could do one on my
B	we do need to do some research corpus
A	my corpus project
B	yeah
A	like twenty minutes? jesus man I
B	yeah
A	or was that twenty minutes? I can
B	no it was about twenty minutes I think
A	I could do the same thing with that
B	yeah
A	twenty minutes is nothing
B	yeah
A	we've been talking on this for about twenty minutes
B	mm
A	it's that's just crazy
B	yeah it is
A	to get flown around the world I think it's disgusting do they put you up in a hotel as well?
B	well I think so yeah they put yeah
A	yeah
B	that's what you should go for really
A	yeah
B	screw getting a PhD and stuff just do things like that where you can
A	how much time did you do you have though?
B	to what?
A	well I mean how much has
B	he's got about three or four days I think
A	yeah?
B	well I I don't know that they pay for the hotel for all of the days
A	mm
B	maybe the day before
A	mm
B	but erm
A	but your flights
B	but you've got your flight so you can
A	yeah
B	delay the flight
A	and just you could just pick out
B	and say well I want the flight at later on
A	you could just pick
B	yeah
A	I wanna go to Bogota and do a conference for twenty minutes
B	crazy
A	it is a crazy
B	but with us we'd have to
A	mm
B	both go but then you've got the problem of erm who's gonna like if we've got the same sort of time
A	mm
B	but surely
A	mm
B	time slot
A	mm
B	I'm sure they'd work that out you only have to do
A	yeah
B	you don't even have to give your
A	really?
B	no you can just write an abstract
B	two days before
B	it's ridiculous
A	it is it's it is ridiculous
B	it's sad really
A	it's a sham isn't it?
B	all that money yeah it is a bit but take advantage you know
A	yeah but it is difficult for us now
B	yeah but it's nice to have some
A	I mean you wouldn't be able to do it at all
B	why?
A	what would you do with a baby?
B	well I can do it next year or so when she's not breastfeeding
A	yeah
B	and just mind you I'd be
A	yeah
B	I'm quite attached aren't I? I think it would be quite hard
A	cos I
B	for me to go away for even two days
A	yeah but I don't know if I'd wanna go away either really
B	no
A	for a week cos I would have to do it
B	but
A	wouldn't be able to do it in term time
B	now are we allowed to go behind these ones here? hopefully
A	yeah
B	er?
A	yeah
B	but I showed
A	well what did she say?
B	she said she'd go down the steps now
A	yeah but the ones above the steps are just as bad
B	well at least yeah but at least you're not following a great big line of them you're just going over that bit of it
A	I don't know why they just don't remove them
B	yeah get rid of them
A	it's just dangerous there
B	they need to put some
A	yeah have you got your card?
B	no
A	ah
B	yeah
