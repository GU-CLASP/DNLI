C	well that's alright
F	why are you laughing at me?
A	I don't know
F	well I can understand what you were saying I mean you were
B	I don't
A	no we're just joking dad
A	chill out
F	well it's sensitive of you to
F	to be like that and to feel that way
F	this blasted thing like going everywhere
C	two hours and
A	you suck all the air out?
F	I tell you what
B	yeah
F	erm I'll push you
B	I don't think I folded it very well
F	or whatever yeah
C	oh god
F	did you sort of roll it?
B	no just roll it there
F	okay oh it's alright yeah you're supposed to at the end you roll it until it
B	oh
F	but it's fine that's that's alright
C	probably be good
D	was it comfortable?
C	well did we sleep in it?
B	we did sleep in it once
D	you slept in it at our house
F	and then it goes on your back
F	cos it's pack packable
D	so that's what you slept in in the dining room
C	yeah
B	we've gotta get a new one
C	cos we took our well our
B	in January
C	took our one back didn't we?
D	well that's erm that was Lidl's
B	well I saw it in Lidl's
D	forty quid
B	it was forty quid in Lidl's
A	mm
B	but the only thing is in Lidl if it goes wrong Lidl's is the sort of place that has something for about a month and it's
D	no that's rubbish
F	no that's rubbish
D	we bought a microwave from Lidl's a few years ago and it went wrong just well about nearly a year after we'd bought it and dad phoned up the company and they said oh okay then and they sent us a new one without any questions asked and then it went wrong again and they sent us another new one didn't they? erm you know sort of within within the warrant guarantee period but quite a long time so all you do is phone up the company
B	mm
D	and there was something else we got from Lidl's that they we had no trouble
F	wasn't that? oh no it wasn't the air
D	no
F	the erm
D	that was from QVC
F	oh yeah yeah
D	erm I can't remember but there was something else
B	mm
D	so you don't have to take it back to the shop you just
B	we've got sixty quid voucher for Argos now though
C	yeah that's why
A	why?
C	well I've a thing and
D	they've got a brilliant one in Argos that I would have liked to buy but
B	what?
D	it's got internal springs and
F	or whatever you know
B	how much was it?
F	not I don't think it's springs it was internal
B	yeah supports
F	it's
D	hundred and seventy-five quid but I couldn't justify that for an airbed
C	no can't justify that
D	no
C	can't decide if you're
D	I was tempted but I thought no that's erm
B	yeah but I
C	cos realistically they are intrinsically flawed as a thing
F	mm
C	because whatever you do
F	mm
C	you're gonna put pressure on it and
D	yeah
B	but I I
C	it will just tear and it will just leak and
B	before I missed that I hoovered doing that
C	yeah well you know
D	mm
C	hoovering and cleaning up and everything yeah
D	yeah that's the just make sure you
F	yeah yeah
B	but I've taken that's like the fourth one I've taken back to Argos now
D	mm
C	cos they keep bursting
B	yeah
D	I don't think they're designed to last
F	yeah no
D	it's just quite handy to have cos I can get rid of the
B	I don't know why you're doing that
D	because we want to get
B	I think that's such a stupid idea
C	what getting rid of the settee?
B	yeah
C	why? why don't you think?
D	the bed's sitting
C	it's a good idea of your dad's
B	because
C	you're gonna put just a proper bed in it?
B	it's much more comfortable
D	no we're just gonna have an airbed when people stay
B	I think it's much more comfortable
D	because we wanna make it just some office the area
B	yeah but that is a sofa it's not a bed in the middle of the room is it? it's a sofa it's
D	I suppose I suppose we could get rid of the wardrobe out of there
F	yeah we'll see
D	and just have some filing cabinet
B	I mean I think you
C	just don't you have on your
D	no there's two windows
C	oh does it have two windows? ah
D	it's got a window on each wall and it's just a
C	cos I was just wondering
D	it's the only room with two windows
C	if you could have one of those have you seen those really skinny fold down beds and where you have the table on it?
F	yeah yeah yeah
C	and it all folds down and like so you can actually have your your
F	oh right
C	table and then you just pull it and it all folds the table up
D	yeah we should put
B	oh yeah that would fit
D	yeah it would double bed would fit in there
C	what's gonna be in my room then?
D	no we're keeping it as it is now
B	I liked my room when I before I moved back in I think that was the
D	what do you mean before you moved back in?
B	when I moved out you moved it all around
F	yeah
D	yeah what with bed settee in there
B	yeah I think it was really nice like that
D	yeah but we want a room where we can put a filing cabinet and all our cos we've gotta get all our paperwork sorted out it's a complete mess isn't it?
F	well I was gonna start with the hallway it's full of
D	yeah
F	you know paperwork that needs
D	most of it's chuckable
F	storing or something yeah no so it is yeah
A	I'll help you
D	oh
F	no
B	there's a filing cabinet downstairs
A	why?
B	if you want it
D	because you go oh now come mum and dad let's get organised let's get oh you're the worst people at organising yourselves and then
A	you are and that's a fact
F	can we can we can we say something?
B	there's a filing if you want a filing cabinet
F	can we get the room started before we start
B	there's one downstairs
F	sorting the paperwork out?
C	yeah
F	yeah?
C	that's probably a bit more
A	I just wanna
F	look at the room I'll get a desk in there
A	I just wanna be helpful
F	and I'll get a phone and then I'll
B	dad talking of erm things we're clearing out this house within like in like next two weeks we're gonna be clearing things away
F	yeah well I'm going back to work on Monday so yeah
B	okay
D	erm what we could do I suppose is keep the bed settee in there and get rid of the wardrobe and then have a filing cabinet and a desk over in that corner
F	yeah
B	what are we gonna do with that in the meantime?
F	yeah well we'll have a look when we go
D	mm
F	in there
D	yeah
F	what the light?
B	we wanna keep that for the salon
F	what the light or the gun?
B	no the whole cabinet
F	oh right
B	that one do you reckon you is there any way you can store it until I need it?
F	what?
B	that cabinet
D	er
C	I don't know that might actually come apart
A	why don't you just keep it in here if you need it?
F	well yeah
B	cos we wanna decorate this room and we want it as clear as we can possibly get it
C	yeah well
F	well I can store it but then I'll only store it in
B	yeah that's
F	but isn't it a bit of a
B	I don't want it there
F	hoick it all the way down to
B	I don't want it in this house
F	and bring it back
C	and it's annoying me
A	well
C	that is what we could do
D	well it looks like it could be
C	what what?
D	flat packed
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	is there? I want that smashed up
C	you want what smashed up?
C	is do what we said and which was the plan which was we clear the basement of all the junk and the rubbish

C	no
C	erm
C	I I've gotta get back out for
C	cos he's he's
F	he's buying more fish?
C	yeah
D	fish are a pain in the arse you get nothing no feedback from them all they need is cleaning out
C	have you seen the marine ones?
D	absolutely nuisance they're beautiful
C	the marine ones are amazing
D	yeah but they're very difficult
C	I I would see that
D	to keep alive cos you need to be really
C	yeah
C	yeah he spent he does spend a about an hour a day
D	they're really specialised well I used to have just a big fish tank with a filter and all that
F	mm
D	and I I was always cleaning them out all the time
F	yeah
B	we used it as
D	it's like it was a pest
B	a chicken run didn't we?
D	yeah in the end well when we moved to
F	we didn't have chickens there
B	yeah we did
D	yeah

F	that's just cruel
B	not with water in we put hay in it
F	oh
D	we had the fish tank in the garden
F	but surely they'd just float
B	yeah
D	she came well she went to her friend's house to play one day and came home with a chicken
B	it was a chick
