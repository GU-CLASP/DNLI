A	yeah security just doesn't exist anymore
B	that's why I got out of it
A	right
B	documentaries

A	yeah
B	and then I was
A	yeah
B	but after a while it was kind of getting a bit of a drag you know? and then I met my future husband
A	yeah
B	and then I thought well no I want something where I can contribute more
A	mm
B	you know so
A	how long did you
B	I did it for well I got my film degree in two thousand and two
A	right
B	then I went and did
A	mm
B	so I did some training first
A	mm
B	and then studied it thinking that would help you know to make the contacts
A	yeah
B	as you say networks and everything
A	yeah
B	but it doesn't change the system
A	right he's he's lucky

A	I mean
B	nepotistic kind of
A	once his contract finishes

B	yeah
A	for what he what he did he's getting good money
B	yeah which is
A	yeah

A	I'm like I'm a wannabe
B	but then also in a way you your band like you didn't wanna be on Top Of The Pops either? like you could've in a way

A	pirate labels or white labels
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	you know?
B	people like them
A	yeah it's
B	yeah
A	that's right

A	mm absolutely
B	yeah
A	so I had to I had the I decided that
B	mm
A	my my my partner at the time business partner at the time
A	and he was he was going we were going opposite ways
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I took myself back to

B	that must've been a life changing event as well
A	I thoroughly
B	yeah
A	you know really really kind of you

A	erm
B	okay
A	and that was kinda split down the middle
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah

B	yeah
A	we had
B	yeah
A	young
B	yeah
A	the ones that don't
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah exactly attracts a lot of foreign students yeah
A	yeah
B	it's a good community
A	it was quite it was quite quite mixed
B	yeah
A	quite mixed
B	it's good that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I I I I I loved it
B	yeah
A	yet yet again a life changing experience and
B	yeah
A	something we wanted to do
B	yeah yeah so what did you study then?
A	yeah
B	wow
A	yeah
B	that's
A	yeah
B	that's kinda quite
A	yeah
B	quite dry in a way like different from
A	it was
B	the arts like
A	well
B	just
A	it was
A	it was
B	yeah
A	it was
A	but it's one of them things
A	cos in
B	yeah
A	and I got talking to someone and they said like you know this degree is quite a broad degree
B	mm
A	yeah?
B	mm that's nice yeah
A	and then you know it's a good base
B	yeah it's a good base
A	cos cos
B	yeah
A	in what direction you wanna go
B	too true
A	and
B	that's amazing
A	because
B	yeah
A	that that same degree I've got into paralegal with that degree
B	seriously?
A	yeah
B	wow
A	you know?
B	yeah it's how you
A	it's not
B	yeah
A	how you sell it
A	yeah? how you sell it
B	cos I did paralegal work as well
A	oh did you?
B	yeah
B	but you're right because I had a business studies degree you know how they
A	yeah
B	and you're right you could pick and choose like a smorgasbord
A	yeah
B	to put that legal hat on you go yeah I did law at
A	that's right
B	my part of
A	that's that's right
B	and they go alright give you a job as a paralegal
B	you know? and then and then you could be anyone in a way
A	yeah
B	you could put all different hats on
A	absolutely
B	cos that's great
A	cos that cos that all depends on how you how you
B	mm
A	cos I didn't know I was gonna
B	mm
A	you know? I
B	yeah
A	in law
B	it's something your
A	I
B	brain
A	you know it was a dream
A	it was like it was a dream you know?
B	it's a dream
A	yeah
B	to be a lawyer
A	I thought maybe that I was gonna
B	it's a big aspiration to have yeah
A	but when I started to do some of those units
B	yeah
A	I thought
B	it killed me
B	and you know they also say that erm
B	to study law is fantastic
A	right
B	because as a lawyer you're trained to think
A	right
B	to cover your client
A	mm
B	so you're always looking at the negative side
A	yeah
B	of what can happen
A	mm
B	to practice it

A	and knowing that
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	and knowing that it's not rocket science really
B	no it's not
A	you know? they do their research and pick up the latest
B	yeah
A	and
B	you can just do it
A	and er
B	yeah
A	law is constantly evolving and changing
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah that's true
A	well
B	mm mm
A	I decided that I I certain contacts in living in

B	mm
A	and I've all you know so
B	yeah
A	I'm going with the flow here
B	mm
A	you know? obviously I enjoyed the environment
B	yeah
A	once I'm working with young people
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I
B	mm mm
A	er it was called
B	mm mm
A	and that was
B	yes very important project then?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it was basically delivered right across
B	mm mm
A	er in every borough
B	wow
B	what a great experience
A	yeah
B	though
A	yeah
B	being able to implement something like that
A	yeah
B	and how did it go?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so experimental?
A	cos
B	yeah
A	coming from the Home Office
B	yeah
A	it was targeting young people geographically in deprived areas
B	mm
A	er it was
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	so I was working in partnership with the youth offending team
B	mm mm
A	er
B	mm mm
A	football basketball
B	mm mm
A	underpinned with an education programme
B	mm mm
A	you know?
B	mm mm
A	so
B	mm
A	you know?
B	sounds like you were putting on these different kind of you know events and trying to make them into
A	well absolutely
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	then I went for a promotion
B	mm
A	er
B	yeah
A	of the
B	mm mm
A	at at the time
B	mm mm
A	and er
B	mm
A	of the all the youth centres
B	ah
A	yeah
B	how many were there?
B	mm
A	then you had like satellites
B	okay
A	yeah?
B	mm mm
A	so then you you might have
B	mm mm
A	you know? with like hubs
B	mm mm
A	you know? so the main hub would like
B	wow that's a big job
A	yeah
B	was it was it quite frantic though quite like? buzzing around trying to
A	well
B	go to these different centres trying to?
A	well
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah
A	you go out and and and see what the problem is
B	yeah
A	supervision
B	yeah
A	find out what's going on
B	yeah
A	staffing problems
B	yeah
A	you know you you you're constantly
B	mm
A	always the
B	mm
A	always a challenge
B	did you think the primary managers were competent? in their jobs?
A	well
B	mm
A	was a a change of ethos
B	right
A	you had like a lot of the old school
B	right
A	who
B	yeah
A	really couldn't identify with the pace of where
B	yeah
A	wanted to take them
B	and that happens
A	yeah
B	yeah people get replaced
A	yeah
B	new people
A	absolutely
B	mm
A	you know it's you you
B	yeah
A	it's very very very very difficult
B	so you have to really try to influence them
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	training
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and my I I try to bring them along with me
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	because they're used to the old school
B	yeah
A	of doing what they want when they want
B	yeah
A	and and taking the P
B	yeah
B	is that the only other route? it's the only
A	well
B	right okay
A	you know? you know you reach out to them
B	yeah
A	numerous occasions
B	yeah and if they turn you down
A	yeah but but you reach out to them and and you don't communicate what you're doing
B	yeah
A	so you can't
B	mm
A	to reach out to the individual
B	mm
A	and you constantly reach out and you're training
B	mm
A	you know?
B	mm
A	well no
A	are they incompetent?
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah? and you can't
B	no
A	on
B	rather
A	you know?
B	like you have you have to really persuade and argue and
A	that's right
B	encourage and
A	you know
A	well that's well this is the skill of the
B	mm it is
A	you know that's not everyone's cut out to be a manager
B	and I think maybe all of your different experiences from before
A	yeah
B	I mean not to say that you were fake or insincere in your role
A	no
B	but it certainly helps
A	mm
B	when you're
A	yeah
B	you know your
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	I I I I
B	yeah
A	but I do think
B	yeah they do
A	yeah but they no
B	there's some people who wanna do bad in this world
A	I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm from that perspective
B	yeah
A	everybody
B	me too
A	wants to do good
B	I believe in that
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	even the person that is doing bad
B	mm
A	they'll justify it in their head
B	why they're doing it
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	mm?
B	yeah
A	so as I'm
B	yeah
A	as I'm I'm I'm
B	mm
A	everybody wants to do good
B	mm
A	so when they're doing something
B	mm
A	which is not right
B	mm
B	mm
A	you know what's going on?
B	mm
A	why are you choosing?
B	mm this pathway
A	that
B	yeah
A	and like I try to explore explore that with them
B	mm
A	because
B	yeah
A	to a loving wife
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	it
B	yeah
A	you know? everyone
B	yeah
A	so
B	unconditionally if possible
A	if someone chooses
B	yeah
A	if someone chooses to do something evil
B	yeah
A	or
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	well
B	mm
A	personal development
B	I love that too
A	yeah?
B	that is totally my area
B	I just maybe I've come to a different
A	right
B	but I'm definitely at that point that's where I am now
B	yeah
A	you know so so
B	mm
A	you know I just
B	mm
A	I just fit there
B	mm
A	you know?
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	yeah? you have to you know?
B	mm
B	yes
A	that's it yes I remember I remember one of my colleagues calling me that oh
B	mm
A	so so if you if you if you do that sometimes people can see that as a weakness
B	mm
A	but I tell you what
A	I'm I'm I'm I'm cutting the I'm cutting the long story here
B	mm
A	I had
B	ah
A	yeah
B	oh
A	yes
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	oh no
A	yeah they were they and they were both they were the same ones that were

B	yeah yeah
A	and er
B	makes me cry now
A	yeah?

A	yeah?
B	why is it? the way that it is?
A	yeah
B	but it is yeah
A	yeah
B	ah
A	well
B	making me cry
B	cos I know what it's like when you have to leave people that you work really intensely with
A	yeah
B	it's really special
A	and
B	yeah
A	and you know
B	yes they have
A	so they
B	yeah
A	right
B	yeah
A	he his style of management was different
B	right
A	cos he still tried to manage by
B	right
A	you know? and I remember
B	yeah
A	and I said that I that I was shocked
B	wow
A	yeah and I'm I'm
B	yeah
A	I didn't know what to do
B	it's like
A	so
B	heart wrenching
A	so
B	mm
A	you know?
B	mm
A	you know? it's like you know?
B	mm
A	you know? they they may give you the the the tough you see the tough side of them but they still love you
B	mm
A	and you don't
B	think their way?
A	you you you can't see the seed that you're planting sometimes
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	and they were giving me this
B	mm
A	I'm tough and
B	mm
A	you know?
B	but deep down
A	that's right
B	very deep down
A	very deep down
B	and it's only when you were leaving
A	absolutely
B	that it just couldn't
A	absolutely
B	it had to come to the surface
A	I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't tell you
B	bet you were
B	you know because now you kinda see it you know you see it you feel it
A	totally blown away by them
B	mm

B	seen that again and again
A	yeah
B	I've tried
A	yeah
B	trying to get it

A	the
B	responsive
A	absolutely

A	yeah
B	start doing this and they go all of the sudden this other way
A	absolutely
B	responsiveness
