A	do you reckon your dad misses your mum a lot when she's not here?
B	oh shit
A	it's alright I think I can I can get it
B	it's just erm in
A	mm
B	oh
A	I know
B	no damage done though
A	mm
B	just a bit sticky
A	be alright
A	yeah
B	it's a nice temperature
A	I might have toothache
B	oh
A	cos I'm eating on that side all time cos I'm I'm sick of getting stuff stuck in that one
B	yeah mm
A	yeah
B	when I had my braces? it's in the erm toothbrush pot in the bathroom
A	mm
B	just give the tip a little wash
A	yeah
B	but I wash it every time I've used it anyway and that's really good because it's so thin
A	yeah
B	with the long handle you can
A	get in there
B	get in there
A	yeah
B	for what I need
A	yeah
B	cos I know I know
A	I
B	I have like shampoo and stuff left over but it's in a bag somewhere
A	yeah I must admit I'm looking forward to like getting my stuff in
B	I know
A	and like moving in properly
B	it's I'm getting so excited now that it's getting closer
A	yeah me too
B	like it feels more real
A	yeah
B	but cos I'm quite a panicky person as you know
A	mm
B	like hopefully we'll have roughly the same timetable but if you start a little bit earlier than me then I'll come in with you and I'll just hang around then at least the first few times then we're not making the journey alone
A	get some work done
B	yeah exactly
A	just get some work done like when you're there do some reading like
B	and then at least we're not doing the journeys alone
A	cos er my days are pretty full like my whole week
B	mm
A	and just do the reading that I need to do
B	I'm going to do that as well
A	I'm gonna have like a strict schedule next year of reading and I'm gonna fucking do it cos this year I did no reading whatsoever and I really like struggled
B	but it's gonna be easier for us to do that because thinking about it
A	no
B	and there's no point getting a bus in a few times a day that'll be expensive before we get bus passes and stuff
A	yeah
B	and time consuming so I reckon that hopefully my timetable will be a little bit better this year
A	yeah
B	whereas second semester was really good because I got two days off but the three days that was in were were like practically full
A	yeah
B	so I'm hoping it's gonna be a bit more like that now so that I can go in for a whole day
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	from nine o'clock in the morning till five o'clock at night
A	mm
B	like school
A	yeah
B	and I I want it to be like that but I'm gonna go to the library way more
A	yeah me too
B	to do my work and stuff
A	how much did you get deducted from your rent then? for your deposit?
B	er
A	is that it?
B	yeah I got a hundred and seventy something back I think a hundred and seventy-one so not much at all but I think that was just for the burn marks that were in the chairs cos to be honest nothing was damaged and it
A	they must have cleaned it
B	they obviously cleaned it like
A	yeah
B	burn marks on chairs like even though I wasn't in that flat and it's not my fault it's you know I'm not gonna
A	it would the
B	I'm not gonna go to everyone and say like give me ten pound each or like a fiver each or something that's ridiculous
A	yeah
B	it's twenty something quid but
A	well we're not gonna have that problem this year so
B	no once I get my next bit of rent sorted I'm gonna sort my finances out once you leave with my dad and stuff
A	yeah
B	so that I can get it set up until my student loan comes in with cos I'm gonna pay the rent every month
A	yeah
B	I think that'll be much easier for me to do
A	yeah you're not giving him the two full the full two hundred?
B	well he doesn't want it
A	oh okay
B	cos it got deducted
A	mm
B	I'm gonna have a look at how much money I have I might just pay him in like little instalments
A	mm
B	and he can take it out of my euros that I have
A	how much euros have you got saved up now like?
B	four hundred and something
A	oh that's good
B	yeah but that's gonna go towards a cost of living
A	mm
B	like for September that's gonna go towards my rent
A	yeah well your student loan comes back comes in the day after you land in England so you won't be waiting long for it
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	and then
A	yeah
B	and then use my student loan to
A	mm
B	so my French money's gonna pay for rent hopefully
A	just remember that it three hundred and ninety-one pound and three pence or something ridiculous like that comes out at the twenty-second of every month
B	I'm gonna get my dad to
A	so you need to remember
B	always transfer four hundred
A	yeah
B	cos then that's exactly for rent
A	yeah
B	and then I can use my student loan myself
A	yeah
B	but I'm gonna give the student finance a ring erm probably not today but tomorrow
A	it's an 0845 number it's gonna cost you fortune from here
B	no no the
A	oh the French one okay
B	yeah just to make sure that everything is intact because erm
A	right okay
B	so I just wanna make sure that because I'm not living in France and stuff they might have just sent me the email straight away of confirmation and I'm not gonna get any other emails cos I'm not living in France
A	yeah
B	I'm hoping that's the case because if if they
A	yeah
B	exactly it's not even money to live off
A	you should talk to
B	give them a ring when I get back to England
A	mm
B	yeah I'm gonna have a look at any kind of help that I can get though because
A	well ring them before you leave because it's a house er number anyway so it'll be free
B	mm
A	so ring you when you sort your finances out with your dad
B	yeah I'll do all of that with my dad I'll take a day out to do that
A	mm
B	as long as I do get the money from France though I know everything will be fine
A	yeah
B	it's just the stress of if that doesn't happen cos I know that my dad will always be there to help me but he's not in a position where he physically can
A	yeah
B	and I know that he would but I don't wanna put my parents in that position where they have to live off less because I don't have enough money
A	mm
B	that's not fair I don't wanna do that
A	yeah
B	but if worse comes to worse I'll just get myself a part time job
A	yeah
B	and I'll live off that
A	you're getting the full whack from student finance this year aren't you?
B	yep
A	it's just under eight grand
B	I'm only getting twenty quid more than I did last year though
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's inflation though it's gone up a little bit
B	so
A	have you looked at
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	seven thousand eight hundred and something
A	yeah nearly eight grand
B	yeah
A	but rent's cheaper this year by about four or five hundred quid
B	yeah exactly so the money that I
A	living
B	bus pass
A	bus pass yeah
B	erm just really really need this French money so I need to ring and check that it's all alright but I have
A	yeah you don't want to yeah
B	cos you know I might need it in the third year I might need it towards getting a placement or something
A	mm
B	yeah rather than a voluntary work yeah
A	yeah
B	so hopefully
A	and you do get paid for it
B	it'll all be alright
A	you normally get about fifteen grand to twenty grand a year
B	yeah but I'm thinking about just doing three months
A	yeah
B	erm
A	well you don't have to be abroad to do a
B	no I know but
A	placement
B	I don't wanna do it in England
A	right okay
B	I want to put it well I want to take advantage sort of being able to go abroad without having to worry about every single part of financing
A	mm
B	so hoping
A	mm
B	figure it out
B	yeah
