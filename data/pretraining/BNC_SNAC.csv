A	but it's kinda like a forum but not a forum really it's in a different format it's more like a
B	I don't really know what it is I seem to get the news on it and like sign up to people
A	yeah I'm not signed up on it but I go
B	yeah I don't like Twitter or
C	I've never been on Twitter
B	no
A	Twitter's it's not like Twitter
B	no
A	it's not like where you
A	yeah
C	do you remember MSN?
B	yeah way way back
C	that's old school
B	that is old school
C	used to go and leave everyone at school go home go on MSN chat to everyone who you just saw at school
C	nice idea
B	honestly they weren't Metallica
A	I'll just show you
A	how's the battery life on that?
B	it seems to be good so far
A	it used to be like bottom right but
B	mm oh on that thing?
B	yeah
B	er erm you scan to the right it will tell you the like the
A	maybe it's there
B	er or if you just
A	don't leave it plugged in all the time
B	yeah
A	like unplug it like and charge it down and then back up like once a month or something
B	that's what I've been doing
A	yeah that's fine you don't need to like do it frequently
B	oh okay
A	mm
B	okay unless it's SSB is that right?
A	no that doesn't matter the SST is the hard drive not the battery
B	ah no I'm thinking about de-fragging sorry
A	oh de-fragging erm
B	it was telling me earlier not to de-frag if I had SST but I don't have HDD or something
A	yeah you probably don't have an SST on it
B	yeah
A	er I once a year
B	it's set up on Windows 8
A	yeah
B	de-fragging
A	I wouldn't worry about it
B	I can use the one
C	I mean the best thing to do is just to er I always just put it back to what is it restore mode where you put it back to a date
A	yeah
B	mm
C	just do that then
A	or if you get a virus
C	yeah but if you just go what it is F11 mode? go into safe mode?
B	yeah yeah
C	so if nothing happens you can get rid of it
B	I've got one touch restore or something on it
C	that sounds a bit dodgy
B	uh?
C	what happens if you touch it by mistake?
B	I think it asks a series of would you like to as a rule
C	well surely a virus
B	you start it when it's booting I think but erm I wonder why
B	I bought a terabyte but I bought a terabyte hard drive er but you don't need a disk or anything like that you don't need to like do anything I just had a terabyte hard drive but when I actually got it it was only like eight hundred and sixty
C	push the ashtray this way a little bit please
A	yeah sure
B	it has a it has er start-up image written on to the hard drive so that I can always restore it back to when I first bought it without a CD or without anything else
A	yeah
B	so it's got I've lost space but I've got the image so
A	yeah
B	and I can back up another image of what my computer is now to like a hard drive or something which I may well do
A	it's probably like a hidden partition that you can't actually see at all
B	yeah I think it is
A	yeah
B	yeah I've got one on my computer and now I've got a hand-held one as well
A	yeah
B	and I've got a five hundred one my five hundred's full now though how much stuff do you guys have? how many megabytes and stuff?
A	erm probably like five hundred
B	er same
A	but mostly like movies that I may wanna watch
B	TV series
A	yeah
B	what about you
C	yeah just movies music
B	what do you have like a few hundred? five hundred?
C	no it's full
B	it's full
C	yeah but I got it years ago it's eight hundred
B	oh it's an eight hundred one it's full
C	yeah
B	okay
C	had it for years though
B	that's quite a lot of stuff
C	I just copy other people's hard drives and shit
B	yeah
C	then when you go through the movies like shit delete
B	yeah get rid of them
C	but some movies you keep
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I've realised now getting this thing I've been downloading all the shittest quality everything because that thing's tiny it didn't really matter but now I've got this thing and I play the videos they look really bad
C	have you ever done anything in MS-Dos
A	MS-Dos
C	yeah we used to load games up with MS-Dos like Prince of Persia with like C colon forward slash whatever we used to
B	do you remember
C	but that's that was before Windows though it's crazy
B	do you remember there was a game?
B	but they still use Dos though don't they? you can still use Dos now
C	how many people do you think use MS-Dos to load a game up?
A	well
B	that green one? elevator?
A	massive box monochrome screen
B	yeah
A	so just black and green and that was just Dos
B	yeah
A	and we I played Prince of Persia on that
C	mm but when you're old
B	so did I
C	no one will have ever done that mate
B	no
C	you'll probably be the last sort of person who used MS-Dos
A	yeah probably
C	MS-Dos generation mate
B	we'll all get it tattoo'd
A	MS-Dos
C	back in the year of MS-Dos that's when things were real
B	I remember when phones first proper came out like when they weren't just like in the car
C	everyone had a Nokia
B	or not like in a massive thing suddenly they were just a small phone with no aerial and it was like whoa
B	Nokia 3210
A	they went from having like massive aerials to the then pull-out ones and then just to the little stump
C	yeah
A	and then to none
C	do you watch an old video clip of an old phone with one of the early cameras
B	do you remember black and white TVs? do you remember nan's black and white TV?
A	like the 3310 was just like a massive body and then when you look at these when you
B	mm
A	but when you look at it it's just like this massive bezel around this tiny little box
A	yeah can't see shit those things were hardy though like
B	yeah yeah you could chuck them round get them wet sometimes as long as you like dry
A	yeah
B	I mean
C	have you got a tablet?
A	no
B	no
A	you wanna get one though don't you?
B	I'm considering it I've got like loads of digital textbooks now
A	yeah
B	it'll be much handier to
C	I think I would read something if I had a tablet cos the quality looks quite good
B	yeah I'm not gonna get an expensive one just like a hundred quid or something you can get like an Asus
C	yeah I've been on a on a Apple one
B	Asus make the Google plaques Google?
B	so what's Google plaques?
A	Nexus Google Nexus
A	I'm knackered after that fighting fit
C	yeah
B	I was knackered today carrying all those boxes
C	what kettle bells do you use which make?
A	we don't have kettle bells anymore
C	really?
A	well we do but no one uses them
A	they've got erm they got like these fighting bags
C	yeah oh the like round dummies
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	so you use them instead of kettle bells
C	yeah
A	and they've got like you can do all sorts of shit
C	mm
A	but like we don't do the swings or anything that you do with the kettle bells
C	no you can't really
A	no
B	they're too big aren't they
A	yeah they're quite heavy though
C	mm
A	maybe
C	I've used them
A	ten
C	yeah there's like two types isn't there?
A	we've only got one
C	oh right is it one I thought he had like two different
A	no these are all black you know like you have maybe that big so like someone's torso and
C	yeah
C	I know
A	mm
B	where is this place?
A	it's down by er behind
B	oh okay
A	it is yeah
C	I think you can go there as an adult and get pissed
B	really?
C	yeah
B	probably keep it up at night or something
A	that would be pretty fun
B	be a crazy place to
C	I know someone who's done it in
A	just rent the place out for an evening
C	yeah
A	get mashed
A	they'd come in in the morning to clean and there'd be like fucking vomit everywhere
C	do you want some?
A	no I'm good
B	sorry that thing was too spicy those two chillies were quite strong
A	yeah
C	I thought it was spicy
B	yeah
A	I ate the meatballs but there was too much sauce
B	fair
C	I think with something like that you need bread to really mop it up good old bread
B	good old potato potato mops shit up
C	mm
A	good bread though not that shit you bought
B	that was just for breadcrumbs
A	you bought like forty-pence loaf of bread
A	it's not the kind of bread that you'd buy and you'd be like oh I'm hungry I'll just eat some bread uh this is shit
C	mm
B	the thing is I didn't
C	should have got a French stick mate cheap
B	yeah I was just making breadcrumbs
C	mm yeah you don't want a French stick for that
B	I suppose I could have put the meatballs in a French stick
C	mm
A	that'd be quite good
B	yeah I should have done that
C	French stick would have really mopped the sauce up
B	stuffed mashed stuffed peppers are
B	yeah
C	if cheese was blended in with the mash
B	mm
C	oh right
B	I would normally do that
C	you're not oh you don't like cheese?
A	I'm not having any dairy at the moment
C	oh right
B	I told you
C	mm
B	I need some water
C	why do you think
B	I have no idea I'm just
A	how often do you go to the
C	er I was there for two years I think
A	oh cool yeah
A	I've done a couple of the
C	yeah yeah
A	and er I should really continue
C	mm
A	but it
C	yeah he does
A	they chuck a lot at you
C	yeah he is too much really for one lesson
A	yeah
B	I found kick-boxing pretty intense when I did it
C	you need to find a good gym
B	that was full on
C	I've been to some where it's just like everyone's there just to prove a point and I've been to some like
A	really I think you need like a smaller class
C	yeah
A	cos like even with er the fighting fit like if you haven't done kick-boxing before
C	mm
A	you
C	yeah horrendous
A	like it would take ages before they finally come round and tell you like how to do it
C	but you got to
A	yeah
C	do you know what I mean? he should he used to do a lesson where it's just on stand-up
A	yeah
C	and you get better like technique that's what it's all about really
A	yeah I remember like I I think I went a couple of times and I had a girl as my partner for the er
C	is she the doctor?
A	no she wasn't a doctor
C	was she blonde?
A	er she was blonde actually
C	there's a blonde girl who goes who's a doctor slim
C	she's had like four four fights and she's knocked some girl with her elbows
A	really?
C	yeah mate
A	I don't know whether it was her
C	oh right
A	er but I didn't take it seriously cos she was quite small
C	mm
B	do you see any
A	er no there were lots of pubs
B	I went to one at our hotel it was quite good erm there was one that was a joke round there were two midgets fighting I shit you not like in fucking erm
C	shall I show you someone getting knocked out from
A	yeah sure
C	I don't know if you met him
A	er if you show me and I might know him
B	sounds like you two went at different times
A	yeah
C	the erm can you just get through the password for us please?
A	no shit
C	yeah mate it's like his first fight
B	I've fiddled with a few of these before that feel wobbly but I think this one feels kind've sturdy that one's got a bit of a kind've
A	yeah that's quite solid
B	wobbliness to it and I picked up one in the shop as
A	that's the key wobbling
B	yeah
C	write battle arena
C	no like double L or something
A	that's pretty harsh though
B	yeah
C	er just get rid of the aitch in
B	I did kick-boxing for a bit at uni
A	mm
B	it was pretty intense it was like just two hours of working out basically
A	mm
B	we didn't really do that much kick-boxing he was just training us up to be fit enough to actually be able to kick-box he was taking it pretty slow with us but he was good and I did it for like
A	what was the structure of your course? like did you do any er like core exercises or anything like that?
B	erm
B	yeah it was just loads of exercises it wasn't like actually fighting or anything we didn't get to fighting I only did it for a few months and it was then the course just started
A	yeah I don't know how it was there but
B	it was just intense
A	fighting fit at the
B	yeah
A	and then
B	I'm pretty sure it was like similar
A	things like that
B	but it was erm small-scale it was just one guy and he rented out a classroom
A	maybe
B	it was full on I remember it was like you didn't get much of a break at all and it was like
A	yeah
B	tough lots of press-ups
A	yeah you do that for about ten minutes then you get the the like half-sized fighting bags that you can like punch and shit like that
B	yeah yeah
A	do that for another ten minutes and then the kick bags which you then punch and then you kick and then you punch and kick
B	yeah
A	and then it's some core work-out and then like a stretch and rest and that's it
B	I do need to start a class
A	not well yeah potentially
B	mm
A	erm I bought like a bunch of tickets
B	that's quite a bit of money though
A	yeah I didn't
C	yeah he makes he
A	yeah
C	no I don't I don't er if you like that option but
B	what blocks?
A	well cos I knew when I started like like er I think I actually started just before Christmas last year and like I knew the weather was gonna get shit and I wasn't gonna wanna walk like half an hour to get there
B	mm
A	so I didn't wanna pay monthly cos I knew that I wouldn't do it over Christmas and January
B	yeah
A	mm
B	looked like a load of bullshit and it's difficult to find a good class
C	I can't find the guy
A	maybe he asked for it to be removed
C	mm it's on there somewhere
C	why do you feel no not really I'm looking over at you guys
B	pretty much
A	so did you two go to uni?
B	no no no no that's when we split I went to uni I went to
A	oh right
A	oh okay so you were at school together?
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	we weren't that close really until like the last couple of months
C	no
B	no
B	yeah
C	I used to hang around with
B	always crossed over me
C	mm
A	yeah I used to see you in town sometimes around
B	parties
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah I think so
C	you gave us a good price for it yeah still got that tent it's a good tent cheers
A	good good
C	what is
A	it's dead it's gone no it's some shitty shop
C	yeah it's not there is it
A	oh well
B	yeah I got some cheap stuff
A	shitty like three pound coats
B	those those trousers that you gave me those Berghaus ones that were like four pound or something that were reduced from like thirty pound they were erm they
A	yeah they were good
B	they were wearing through like I mean I've worn them like for travelling just for a solid year
A	yeah
B	when you've only got like two pairs of trousers they tend to wear out fairly quickly
A	yeah
A	they were good trousers
B	yeah they were really good three four solid years of wearing them a lot
A	mm
B	every time I hiked
B	Korea's really good for hiking
C	mm got really good mountains there
B	mm yeah
A	I remember that hike
B	they take it seriously as fuck though they all there yeah
A	I struggled
B	at the National Park
A	yeah it was coming down that got me bad
B	yeah
A	I had to stop and like eat some pasta or something
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	it was about six hours yeah
A	and it was quite hot as well
C	what just continuous walking?
B	it was really hot erm it's quite it's cool hike that one you come up either side we come up the long way from the temple like up the mountain and then when you get up to the azalea fields you climb up higher and then it just turns
C	mm
B	and there's the steepest fucking stairs I mean come like winter season you can't get around it's just climbing up ladders
A	I think we went there yeah
B	yeah
A	we definitely we yeah we did the steps on the way down
B	yeah I did some awesome winter hikes when I was there the mountains get proper snowed in it was great we got snowed up mountain
A	oh shit
B	awesome it was freezing cold though man I did a few and one of them my hands were like completely like
A	mm
B	it was really amazing
A	mm
B	and oh my god a double rainbow
B	but we sat at the top of the mountain and I ate like an egg or something and some some cucumber or something with my hands out and then they started to really like hurt and
A	yeah
B	came down and they were just hurting more and more and more while we were like going down they were like de-thawing or something
C	what were you eating?
B	I had a cucumber and some egg or something
C	I wouldn't eat that
A	so random
B	well I do I take like when I go hiking I take like nuts eggs cheese cucumber bit of veg something like that erm some pepper or some carrot or something
A	I'm pretty sure that nuts take like three hours to digest so you're probably like oh I'm hungry need some energy I'll eat some nuts
B	oh I find nuts are pretty good actually
A	yeah?
B	they're good for just a continual energy cos you just like keep munching on them but they're pretty high in fat and protein
A	I know but those are the things that take forever to digest and get into your blood
B	yeah but they don't seem to take that long like probably if you eat then with like raisins or something it helps
C	you use more water and stuff for digesting fat and stuff don't you to break it down?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I like raisins
A	funny thing is if you have too much sugar in your diet you kind've lose the ability to actually metabolise fat
B	yeah
A	like that you eat or that is part of your body
B	mm yeah
A	this is why people just pile on the weight
B	there was a massive campaign a while ago for like fat is bad and it's very it's shit that it's synonymous with being fat like the word fat but let's not like it's really annoying that they have the same word
C	fat's bad for you though
B	basically one is not the other being fat eating fat does not make you fat
A	yeah
C	no you need fat to survive
B	you go to Korea and they're proper thin the people are really quite skinny and they eat loads of fat their pork so fatty it's unreal it's like thick chunks of fat like shit they just eat fat but they're skinny
A	I bet it's good for you though
B	I mean fucking Inuits or whatever are probably like even have high fat diet
A	oh they have barely any carbs they're like
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	but they get all their energy from the fat
B	are they fat? no they just wear big pants and shit
A	yeah
B	yeah that is a find like
C	you need fat you just need it in a healthy amount
B	I like fat it's fucking tasty
A	yeah it was stupid when the whole thing happened
B	skin is so tasty
C	this is what I was saying earlier we weren't designed to eat high fat foods
B	what thing?
A	with the
C	all the time do you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	with this whole
C	it's too mass-produced now
B	you know in Korea they've got poo pigs they eat human poo and then you eat the pig
A	mm
B	it's literally called
B	it's kind've off-putting
C	yeah sounds like it
A	did you like it?
B	er it just tasted like pork it didn't really taste any different
B	have you ever seen there's a video on Youtube somewhere this guy man he's totally serious he's doctor in Korea like a Chinese herbal medicinist and he claims that poo water from the poo of a six-year old boy is like he makes poo wine
C	shut up
B	and this woman this woman drinks it on a documentary he claims he ferments it with poo
A	shut up
B	and he claims though that the health benefits are really it's like a medicinal cure but I'm not even joking
C	mate there's his guy who who uses his missus's lactating tits mate he uses the milk yeah in his cereal cos it's so he like drinks it mate
B	human milk
C	weird
B	I reckon we'd taste good probably what was I talking about?
C	someone who makes wine out of shit
B	yeah poo wine
A	oh
C	oh no this is gonna be rough I don't know if I wanna see this mate
C	how long did it take you to cycle?
A	er
A	to get er what?
C	I live near
A	oh right
C	how long did it take to cycle there?
A	I cycled there in about ten minutes
C	yeah oh it shouldn't take that long
A	er well I'm pretty quick
C	oh right
A	erm and I cycled back in about fifteen
C	yeah oh
A	yeah

C	have you ever been in it?
A	no
C	no

C	oh right
A	and then go
C	does anyone go in there?
A	I've never seen anyone use it
C	no
A	seems like a pointless investment

A	I reckon they must make a killing though cos they charge a lot of money
C	yeah he does
A	it's not like a giant gym or something
C	no he he built it all indoors but he didn't get the planning permission and they're going to take it down
A	really?

C	yeah yeah
B	and it got cold and we got up to like the top you can see there's like ice on the mountain and stuff
C	yeah
B	we like camped up there we just couldn't get to where we were trying to get we everyone felt rough
