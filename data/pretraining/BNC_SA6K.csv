A	yeah
B	that we we are culturally all Europeans
A	yeah
B	you know the fact that he could play that on the piano and she could sing it
A	yeah
B	was the same piece of classical music
A	did you know what it was?
B	no I don't actually know what it was a er
A	yeah
B	but but it
A	how much it kind of really meant something to her as well it was just you know incredible
B	well to him you know he was saying you know sorting through the music and saying oh gosh you know erm this this this this brings me back to
A	yeah
B	and it and you know and
A	yeah
A	oh look at that
B	erm I mean
A	yeah yeah I know what you mean I mean I mean I thought that was quite a poignant part of the film erm yeah it was er definitely the sort of more human side
B	yes
A	but erm my god eight weeks in the army and that was it you know
B	yeah and I don't I don't think that would have I don't think that that would would have happened but apart from anything else was taken was taken bloody you know a week to get across the Atlantic for starters
B	and another week to get out into into Europe wherever they were
A	yeah
A	that bit's a little bit farfetched
B	yeah
A	but made for a good story though I suppose in a way it's an analogy isn't it? it's like you're fresh off the boat whether you've had training or not you know and you're trying to get into a an already very formed erm bonded
C	tight-knit group
B	yeah
A	yes yes
C	kind of like a family
A	yes yeah
B	yeah and nothing is more tight-knit than a tank crew
A	but in a way I didn't think they were really really nasty to him
C	what?
A	in in a sense it was kind of well portrayed it was that you know levels of kind of nastiness and things like that doesn't really come into it it was kind of like you need to understand you need to kill people
C	cos our lives and everybody else's depends on it
A	cos yeah exactly
C	that's you know
A	yeah
C	and you know it's not a natural thing for people to do and if you are going to do it you need a bit of training to get you there
A	yeah yeah
C	or it would be at least and not just killing people but when the shit goes down so to speak once you know the the fire's on
A	or you would have thought
A	yeah
C	and that's the bit where your training just you know don't even think about what you're doing you just do your training
C	that kind of helps you get
C	yeah just become the the all all
A	mm
C	you know trusting the people are a bit more wise or more experienced than you you can't
A	yeah yeah
C	he didn't have any of that
A	no
C	I mean the fact that I was actually quite impressed is without any training he knew how to load and unload thirty calibre machine gun in front of him
B	yeah well I suppose they sort of showed him maybe
C	yeah
B	the way they showed him how to use the grease gun as it's called like submachine gun erm
C	yeah
A	mm
B	the touch I liked was that Brad Pitt had this captured German erm
A	mm
C	I'm
B	yes yeah that's
A	mm
B	you must
B	right
A	mm
B	yeah I'd be interested to know exactly where it was in the English Midlands that that all took place
A	yeah I'm trying to think of I haven't heard of a massive film studio there
C	it's it's not really a studio
A	oh really it's more like a land?
C	it's it's it's just an area of little land that they filmed to do all the Band of Brothers stuff
A	mm
B	they shut off
C	so you know they made up sets yeah
A	so the towns stuff would've been done you know in a studio
C	then Private Ryan because it was Tom Hanks again came again erm
A	mm
C	and then you know they used it so all those things like all the uniforms all the it's all been made I've seen there was a picture of it in The Sunday Times around a couple of months ago
A	mm
C	of the armoury of all this fake kind of stuff that they have left over
A	mm mm
C	which you know people are using all around the globe to make sort of movies
A	mm
C	so they're constantly
D	mm
C	you know even as much as Peep Show did a bit there's one of the episodes where
A	mm
C	you know fat guy John Mitchell goes out with a guy who who finds out that he's actually a racist it's they were going to so even they a little show like Peep Show used bits of the material
A	mm yeah yeah
C	and all the re-enactment stuff you know when you see a bit of history they tell the story on on discovery and then they have real people sort of walking around with stuff almost to sort of highlight the points
A	yeah
B	mm
C	so whoever's
A	it's a costume department
C	yeah so
A	mm
B	no
A	mm have you heard of the TV programme? the children's TV programme which is like lives erm history erm sort of children? erm
C	you talking about the Horrible Histories?
A	Horrible Histories
C	I think it's much as for adults as it is for kids
A	yeah
C	I think it's hilarious
A	but they
C	yeah
A	and I and I could see you know the same costume wise they just bowl up to this lot and go can we have this that and the other? and they go yeah sure you can we've got it we've got it in stacks you know in shitloads so but Horrible Histories is great I think you're right it is just as much for adults
B	no I haven't
A	about half an hour mm
C	it's massive it's a massive phenomenon now
A	mm
B	but there there are cabinets who are very large who specialise in this
A	yeah
B	erm I went to a talk once by a guy who was
A	yeah
C	Kubrick
B	Kubrick Stanley Kubrick
A	I love I love that film
C	over money wasn't it?
B	yeah well no it was about working conditions
C	oh right
B	Kubrick was a monster
A	mm but boy did he make good films
B	yeah but
A	he enjoyed conflict
B	and he got the Turkish army to provide lots of guys who could ride horses
C	you mean all the extras?
B	yeah the extras and he was able to outfit them all in the in the British uniforms because there was no no special effects
A	mm
B	you know?
A	mm
B	there was a cavalry regiment of four hundred guys or four hundred horses
A	just as is yeah yeah and that's what's really impressive
B	and they were all dressed in the in the right uniforms
A	yeah all charging
B	and he was telling us all charging and he said I was able to go to this firm in London
A	mm and get everyone
B	you want four hundred cavalry uniforms of the Crimean period
B	no well
A	and a and a horse yeah was amazing
C	well better
A	mm
C	you know that book you were touching the Horrible Histories? if you get a chance to see one
B	mm
C	we'll record one
A	it's very well done
B	they're good are they?
A	oh they're really
B	yeah cos they're incredibly well written
A	mm
B	but they're they're actually acted by
D	mm
A	no it's very well done
C	and and if they call all the sort of you know
B	mm
C	if you were well if you were in a trench what would it
A	yeah but it's not just one theme throughout the episode it's actually cut up to
B	mm
A	you know right we'll jump from
C	it's a study aid you're not going to be able to pass an A level off the back of it
A	yeah you're not no but it's enough to get you interested in history I think and
B	yeah since last Monday it was part of the
A	now see Michael Goves who's he?
B	Michael Goves
A	Goves yeah who's
C	Gove
A	Gove
B	he he was the secretary of state for education
A	he was?
C	yeah but he became so contentious that these erm all parties have done this now apart from the erm UKIP they've all hired all the experts from the States who've got various people elected so Bush's campaign manager
C	the the Nigel Farage fascist party
C	so the Lib Dems Conservative Labour proponents of Obama or Bush all they've all hired have you ever seen The West Wing?
A	mm
C	you know the guys who get people elected and
A	mm mm hm
C	they don't just do presidents they do senators and cos there's lots of elections and
A	okay mm hm
A	so he was really out on his own then on that one
A	yeah
C	in the same way who anyone who touches the NHS will get a nurse and a doctor and a midwife having having a moan
A	yeah
C	most parents though generally seemed to quite like
A	so
C	so he's got sort of he got a sort he's got a sort of important job but not the he's not the secretary of
A	but not really in in the thick of it so to speak yeah
C	which is well I I think it was a bit of a cowardice act I think he should've been allowed to continue and I think that should be part of the manifesto of the Conservatives
A	so was that Cameron's decision to shift him aside?
C	ultimately yeah
B	mm yes
A	okay because he was getting so much flak
B	but I mean he was he was being told that this guy was a liability as well that's basically why
C	oh
A	all because of what he was saying about education or other things too?
A	god
B	and the teaching of history
A	and this actually had such a a negative effect? just goes to show how political education is isn't it?
B	yeah absolutely no absolutely that's absolutely right
A	so anyway he's not but that that you were saying about the lecture that he was actually
B	well it was more of a discussion actually
A	debate yeah
B	they also had a Conservative MP who was Conservative MP for part of
C	so when parents are talking to you about their schools and their issues and stuff they kind of know what they're talking about cos they've got a bit of personal experience
A	mm
C	then I'm quite good at history I went to
A	though when he went to school
B	but my ah
A	wanted facts
B	he wanted to be based entirely on the facts
A	yeah the
C	but but again I think that's slightly disingenuous because I I I agree with you
B	well with him I'm only repeating what he said
C	no no but I but I think what Gove was trying to do is but if you don't have then again I I look at philosophy
B	mm
C	but again it's a bit like law people that do law don't necessarily go into law it's about analysis
A	mm
C	but unless you know the basics
C	you can't perform analysis
B	no
C	so what he was what Gove was trying to say was up until a certain point you need to know the facts and then as you start getting into maybe sort of thirteen fourteen start going to GCSE and on
B	no no no he
C	then you start laying more analysis and interpretation on it but you can't do that at sort of seven or twelve if you don't know the facts to start with
A	I don't
B	no you're absolutely right I don't think there's any disagreement about that at all
A	yeah
B	and that the the the rather left-wing woman who actually teaches history she she actually put up
A	this isn't A level history this is actually GCSE history
B	I think this was G yeah she
A	cos that could sound quite tough for GCSE
B	yeah
C	mm
B	now I'm not sure if it was A level or whether it was GCSE
C	I'd say that was GCSE
A	really?
C	yeah you've got you've got two to three years to teach people
A	but I think that's the thing that you were saying the other night was trying to squeeze in what? one hour a week is it? to
B	well she said that this was the real one
A	I think that might be quite difficult to get your kids to answer that type of question
B	well
A	but apparently the hours that are soaked up on curriculum is actually maths still maths and well more so maths and English just to try to get them to literacy rate numeracy and you know an academic literacy
C	see that's that's one of the things I've always found slightly funny about the argument is but isn't part of your job as a teacher to make sure that they've already got that?
A	yeah yeah well you have to develop it that's right and you can develop it in other subjects
C	is is is
A	yeah well can't can't couldn't numeracy be taught in geography? like work out the G you know the like history you think about the numbers how many people died?
C	ah I
A	so how many you know people were left? and think about you know academic history you still have to write an essay answer to your to your exam question you can do that in history you can do that in geography
C	I think it's absolutely fascinating
A	you can do that in any subject
A	yeah why don't we just
C	yeah but
A	or you know?
C	you wouldn't just need a geography lesson
A	mm
C	when you see geography in isolation and not realise oh there's bits of trigonometry that we did here
A	mm mm
C	will actually help when you do a survey for oh
A	yeah well you're right in French say
C	you could be trying bits of
A	yeah
C	do you remember the Eddie Izzard
A	laugh
C	and he's going how do I chat a French girl up unless literally the cheeky monkey is on a bicycle and he's going round he's now
C	ah
A	he's he's got it in one
C	yeah you teach a bit of maybe you teach a bit of the war and and
A	yeah
C	and what French German would you need to try and get home again? make the whole thing
A	but even just put a timescale on it you know
A	right let's go back ten years twenty thirty just to even have a sense of what those timescales mean in time and that includes your working outs and things like what was the population size of the UK twenty years ago?
C	show them certain
A	you know it's like it's not rocket science really but they can't seem to get away as you say from the subject-based curriculum
C	and also it's it's very it's very wordy erm
A	mm mm
C	and you spend a bit of time with the teachers
C	and I know how my presentations work when I look at other peoples and mine's mostly images and I do all the talking
C	cos that's where they go they'll see the images and go away and then end up being oh yeah I get what
A	mm
C	some people will go away and it's like fifty bullet points and you got a hundred slides
A	yeah
B	death by
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	but but there's bit of teachers stand up and they're all they talk a lot or it's read the book
A	mm
A	mm
C	you know where is
A	mm
C	I like
A	mm mm mm mm wouldn't that be nice to know? if you if you're a kid and you're walking down Oxford Street and you go ah actually I can
C	I I think people sort of paint it and then turn London back through the ages do you remember erm?
A	yeah
C	it was probably the first kind of interesting version of Orson Wells's Time Machine
A	mm
C	where he sort of sits in it and I mean it's quite a colour it's about the sixties and he presses the levers and does the little dials and you see him kind of zoom through London
B	mm
A	mm yeah yeah sort of whizzing by yeah
C	and all the factories and the windows and everything changes I've seen a version of that taking it through London all the way back to Soho and and
B	mm
C	but again
A	mm mm mm mm
C	and kids sit there going I don't know if I've ever seen a wood I
A	mm mm
C	what's a wood? and what's a wood in London?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	hunting? well what's what's that?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	how do you hunt a stag? why would you hunt? you know
A	mm
B	mm
A	but then the literacy there is that you know I suppose
C	look in the
A	yeah yeah
C	I just think there's a lot of wasted time in class of people going through here's here's how we now teach it and kids don't get it
A	I completely agree with you
B	yeah
A	so what was the outcome do you think though of the debate? was it still sort of open ended and
C	I
B	well there's no easy answers I I think well
A	mm mm
B	by a group of experts by a group of historians and erm
A	because
C	no
B	no no she was a chemist
A	was there chemistry?
B	chemistry and law
C	yeah mm
A	I remember reading about her that you know as a teacher you have like
C	did you just say home economics?
A	as a you know the certificate to teach training
C	mm mm mm
A	you
C	yeah
A	you can see it but I think as well that she was she was chemistry but she had she had these other things
C	I feel kind of sexist she had to have home economics
A	that she had to do as well
C	right
A	so chemistry was her great passion I think but you're right she was a
B	mm
A	chemistry teacher
B	and
C	she never taught straight into politics
B	she well no she she worked as a chemist she worked in
B	she worked in you know
C	ICI or something was it?
B	yeah she worked on on the flavours of ice cream is what she actually worked on
C	oh my god every time you eat vanilla or chocolate ice cream or Neapolitan that's Maggie
B	mm
A	but but I mean though she put
B	erm that that you know erm what what so what what
A	mm
B	erm on the right wing of the Conservative Party he said that that was his take on the whole business and in the end he said yes we've made some changes and there's nothing wrong with changes but basically it's the status quo we we we actually he said common sense won we we won and there haven't been that many changes and we're all pretty well happy with it apart from the woman who said I I can I can fit the curriculum in an hour a week and I think we all believed her actually
A	yeah but you know the thing I'll come back round to again is that the examining boards erm
B	yeah which which which board they take
A	so actually so which is a syllabus it's not a curriculum it's a syllabus
C	which they use for their examination
B	yeah yeah
C	I always used to wonder
A	so for example at GCSE level I never learnt about World War One and World War Two anything like that I learnt all about the Tudors Lancashire Yorkshire you know? War of the Roses and a shitload about the suffragettes
B	yeah cos girls would be interested in suffragettes
A	presumably
B	what what
A	but I actually wasn't
B	oh dear
A	erm so I would have preferred to have had more of a world view of history
B	mm
A	cos when you're talking to people when you're travelling yeah you can talk about suffragettes but not every person
C	did ancient war War of the Roses romantic war
B	yeah well I I
A	and love in terms of the Tudors and you know the Stuarts and oh my god the
B	yeah but what
C	you see and I might suddenly disagree that the bigger the fee the bigger the
A	yeah it helps yeah
C	the deeper the grey cells have to work
B	well that's
C	because I have a certain argument about brain circuitry
B	yeah
C	I don't believe in god or anything I believe it's all brain
B	yeah
C	so it took to to the harder you go the more brain cells you're making which means in life kind of the smarter not more intelligent but the smarter you are if you're only looking at something that's kind of two-dimensional versus twelve
B	yes
C	it's like okay well can you play chess? well that's one thing can you do a Rubik's Cube? okay can you do a six-sided Rubik's Cube?
A	mm mm
B	anyone want any more beer?
A	yeah I'll have a beer thanks
C	alright
A	but the
C	thank you
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	I mean actually the bit you you raised I remember being at
A	thank you
C	erm but I always used to wonder why parents don't get more interested in it is is cos we were a public school
A	mm
A	mm
C	which everyone kind of knew was as in fact everyone sort of used to talk about well can't we do the AEAEL? the allied and
A	that's the easy one
C	and it was like all the thickos you knew who didn't get into your school who went to a
A	mm
C	and of all the thickos that didn't get into your school all got As I'm like
A	yeah
C	but
A	mm no
A	no it doesn't it doesn't
C	so no one in your twenties and thirties are going to fucking argue the toss
A	apart from
C	but you know
A	that's got high sort of you know
B	mm
C	or daughter
A	but there's like other courtesies like
C	all the parents
A	so many countries that do that do do national exams every like China I'll just give an example
C	there shouldn't be a different
A	and there's what? there's how many thousands of children
C	yeah
A	suppose they do it out of administration because they couldn't actually go oh look
C	the one thing that becomes really interesting with with universities is and and again that you know if
A	mm
C	so say for example
A	yeah
C	and this is what the arguments for syllabus is
A	yeah
B	mm mm
C	you know
A	mm mm
C	if you start doing a course at
A	mm
C	and actually
A	mm mm mm
C	or someone from sorry
A	mm yeah yeah
C	there needs to be freedom of movement of
A	yeah
C	to to understand people
A	yeah
B	can you imagine the academic establishment agreeing to that?
A	actually yes in a certain way because if you were working for
B	with the thickos we'll offload the thickos to
C	you're not really doing that from
B	yeah
C	but but the other thing that makes it interesting is you're now paying you know when when when I talk about this everything is kind of free
A	right but I would be fast tracked yeah
C	if you're now paying for that degree
A	if I was really doing very well at university
A	yeah
C	rather than going to somewhere like
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and you're paying the nine K and someone else is paying nine K and isn't getting something out of
A	yeah
C	I need to be looked after properly
A	yeah
C	when it was all free now
A	it's kind of like it
B	it was never free was never free
C	you're playing rugby for
A	well it well it is kind of like a
A	yeah yeah
C	based on merit
A	which is good not based on money
C	yeah or or the time you did an exam
A	because that's what it is based on at the moment
C	which even then I still think is weird
A	yeah
C	you're I know you're three years younger than me
A	yeah
C	but in a sense you're two years
A	yeah
C	because you're August versus September
A	yeah
B	mm
C	an accident of birth by days
A	mm
C	you'd be like mum you should have been trying to hang on for another
A	yeah
C	cos it meant different say education wise you know where are you? you know most people have already done their exams before you even get to your birthday
A	no that that's a very good point yeah yeah
C	so there's you know why isn't it calendar year as well?
A	yeah yeah
C	why don't you do
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	there's all
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but no I like the idea of a university thing is that it should be gives gives more scope for merit based erm achievement
C	and growth at different stages
A	about academia yeah yeah it should be
C	I mean you
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	you might want to take a gap year you wouldn't go you'd probably someone sitting in your class could be almost a year and a half older than you
A	and you might like your university like the campus but you might not actually like living in
B	mm
D	yeah
B	and of course we're taught
A	and it costs money
B	and and and of course you know the universities are earning off these students they don't want to lose them
A	but it's not a bad idea because they have so many partnerships within the
C	then again the people I'm really talking about it's it's affecting UK students
A	yeah
C	not really international students
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	erm
A	I think yeah I think you're right I think you know
C	cos cos the majority have got proper international students who are actually postgrads and you can do that anyway
A	yeah
C	the majority of undergraduates are UK based
A	yeah yeah and that's more likely when you're going to get wrong
C	yeah
A	as in you choose the wrong course or the wrong location or you just simply don't fit in or your
C	or you know the only the only
A	because you might be very bright you know? yeah nobody notices you
C	you're getting a first at
A	yeah but they're not challenging you
C	but if there was that freedom
D	mm
C	you know in a in in a proper meritocracy then you would thrive otherwise it's going to go oh I've got another two years at
A	mm yeah
B	mm
A	so
A	yeah you are going to have your normal university exams but we're also going to have a look at the top five percent of that cohort
C	yeah we're looking statistically across the board
A	and we're now going to give people an opportunity to see if they can get into the same degree pathway but at a different institution because that's just got that
C	cos in a certain sense if you're all UK and and the Scots leave them out because
A	mm hm mm
C	and you're all paying roughly it's nine K to do
A	mm
C	it's not another money issue
A	mm
C	and there might be certain people people who go oh but look this guy's going to be an
D	mm
C	well then there's sports sponsorships there's extra things you can do the problem with the other thing I still find funny and
A	wow they are shameless they do fuck all they really don't do anything enough
C	you know we had weird stuff with
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	mm
C	you know is this person talented? could they?
B	well I I think it
C	yeah but it but it shouldn't do there should be a there should be a national way of looking at this
A	it should do if yeah I agree with you he's
C	and sometimes most of the students don't know faculty
A	yeah they don't even know what the word means
C	they'll go oh shit I got lucky
C	you're sitting in the shit seat
B	certainly the engineering faculty here in
A	yeah but then cos
B	mm
A	but I agree with you like if you're paying nine thousand pounds industry has got input into various different universities geographically or sort of strategically or whatever but there are some universities that are just not doing anything about industry input they're not partnering up enough they're not actually having any effect on the syllabus or the learning
B	no
A	or the curriculum I should say
B	but again I suspect that really would be faculty driven it would surprise me if there was any engineering faculty at any university in the United Kingdom that didn't have a considerable industrial involvement
A	well engineering aviation anything scientific you know any
C	it's it's slightly easier
A	but you've got to think about industries in
C	I I think you'd have very very bright people
A	yeah but financial
C	most people don't come in cos they did media they come in cos they did you know I look at
B	yeah
C	and and there's lots of people like this it's not
A	no the acumen
B	no
C	yeah the amount of kids who come in and go
B	mm
C	and we don't just do any work we do the work that makes us money cos
B	yes
C	and then
B	no
C	there there should be ways that business and
B	yeah
C	you all need to know a bit about you all need to know a bit about human resources if you want to start your own business what do you need to do? and how does it work? If you want to without having to do an MBA to do all of this
A	yeah I think I I I think what you're talking about is professional skills yeah
C	cos this is skills that all of us whatever business you come into whether you're a law or you all need to
A	yeah you do and industry can input into that
C	how to look after staff how to
A	yeah
C	and
A	yeah they should they should
C	there should be like a little business staff college for students
A	mm mm
B	erm which the French which the French
C	part of your three years make make it three and a half years and part of six months are spent being a part
B	yeah
A	mm
B	which the French have got with
A	mm
B	erm
A	but then you have to actually go to one of those so you kind of know what you're getting
C	this should be built into your sort of
A	yeah I think it's
B	yeah
A	so erm there's this idea of erm learn as you earn erm sorry earn as you learn so the idea is that you know you're definitely going to have to pay money for your first degree but you can actually go and do as part of your degree no
C	mm mm
A	you'll you'll really come here to to do your studies
B	mm
A	but in your free time which isn't your free time this is actually part of your curriculum you are gonna go earn some money with this partnership that we've provided for you you'll come back and tell us what you've learned and we'll look at the whole thing of what you've learnt we'll take your exams we'll take your portfolio your coursework some odd things and that's a broader sort of picture
B	well it is I mean it's a bit it's a bit like that year out you did in
A	and it helps people to pay their way
B	right
A	which is when you were a student
B	that's a lot
C	plenty
A	well well it wasn't bad I mean I ate out pretty much every single night I mean it wasn't top restaurants but I mean this is like new to me I was like cool but yeah you're right that money I could probably really tucked away and saved and that could've helped me to when I was trying to find a job you know say at the end of my degree and I'd have a little bit of cushioning
B	yeah
A	but also I would've made those contacts
B	yeah yeah
A	even if I didn't want to go for work to for exactly that company you always network and you find out who else you could go maybe work for and you could interview with them and they'll sort of say yes or no or I'll give you some practice at interviewing it's one thing that they really are bad at
B	mm
A	careers advice at universities no one knows how to interview it seems like no matter what they try
B	because the problem is I suspect people who are revising haven't actually worked in industry so
A	they're very nice people but they're not right on the edge of it
B	yeah
A	whereas at least if you're doing these kind of like you know the work experience thing in and out of your curriculum they might actually provide that as a one-day workshop let's all pretend that you're really going to pretend that you're really going to come and look for a job here now when you graduate let's all pretend or let's do it now
A	yeah let's actually see if you can get in or not yeah
C	set up set up systems do the do the stuff do the
A	mm
C	do this testing see how people cope under a bit of stress and a bit of pressure
A	but you know lots of kids
B	that that that would surprise me
C	but you you you understand now you're a brand
A	but it shouldn't be
C	so so when you're using
A	yeah yeah
C	Linkedin is it is how to make yourself private
A	yeah yeah
C	and the
D	yeah
C	have a good time but keep it private set it up that so just giving people straight that you think you know social media I promise you don't cos as soon as you leave university and you go why don't I get a job dad?
A	yeah well
C	and dad doesn't look at your Facebook page cos I don't know I I thought you were quite charming and a good young chap
B	yeah
C	why aren't you getting a job? ring me up and I'll go
B	yeah
A	well I can tell you I can tell you
C	that's not supposed to be one at work because every work practice now has a sort of moral code
A	yeah
C	there's an ethical code you have to buy into it we all do
A	yeah yeah yeah but the other thing is they don't know how to write CVs and they actually don't know
C	mm I'm not I've seen millions of CVs and I'm going to be honest I'm not sure if I know the right CV
A	no but I think it's easier when you're at an
C	I can tell you stuff not to do I don't know how to make it brilliant
A	a CV when you're actually erm just graduating should be one of the easiest CVs to write
C	oh when you're just graduating?
A	yeah but they don't
A	yeah exactly so it's not that difficult
