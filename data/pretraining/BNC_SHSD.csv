A	yeah it should sound fine
B	what was I saying? oh
A	yeah
B	the more useful it is to say that age and experience means that you're like better placed and more intelligent than someone because you're gonna be older and more
B	yeah to be I mean we don't know any better but sometimes we know better than the people that are older than us but
A	so you
B	it's like teachers in school right who is best placed to judge how well a teacher teaches?
A	students
B	the students
A	yeah
B	but there can never be a situation where students can judge teachers because the everyone
A	they're not yeah
A	so do you think that so you do or don't think that intelligence brings that that that experience brings
B	it does but they say that like for
A	right
B	because there are some people that are older than us who are stupider than us
A	yeah yeah
B	but because they're older we have to show them like more respect for their intelligence and experience when it's less than ours and and just to just to say because we're younger than them that you know it means that
A	does that annoy you?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	it sounds like it annoys you
B	sometimes you do knew know better than people that are older than you but you have no no power or influence because you're younger than them
A	do you think we should have a right to tell them?
B	we do and we exercise that but people will still dismiss it because we're younger than them it's not like we don't tell them
A	well
B	Dr like
A	oh yeah oh my god
B	well everyone just dismissed it as oh it's a kid that's just angry that just doesn't like the teacher rather than the teacher is genuinely poor
A	no but that's because it was
B	it was signed by like forty people
A	yeah I know
B	it's just
A	so
B	yeah
A	and er Atticus told him not to say anything cos she was old and she didn't know better
B	yeah
A	do you think do you think that was the right thing or do you think they should have told her that she was wrong?
B	well one if if Jem just tells her that you're wrong she isn't gonna she isn't gonna listen because she's older than Jem and therefore she must know better or something right? but
A	so cos it's pointless is that right?
B	it's pointless but that's not how why Atticus was saying er Atticus was saying you know you should be better and respect
A	yeah
B	the truth is the ultimate pure er a completely undoctored truth is like it's like you know perfect but people don't wanna hear the truth people can't accept the truth people look at the truth in different ways so
B	it's much easier to put a slant on the truth and then to give it you know full flush that this is the truth
A	so what if a lady
B	yeah
A	I think that's one of the few places religion plays are a really positive role
B	yeah I mean
A	not not few places er
B	yeah people deserve the truth but people don't want the truth people people know the truth it's like if you ask someone would you much rather I told you the truth about something or lied to you about it they'll say the truth all the time right?
A	yeah yeah
B	but they don't wanna hear the truth because
A	I know no
B	the truth isn't what the truth they wanna hear the truth they wanna believe they'd much rather listen to something else and I would say and that one that that woman if you asked her do you want the truth about stuff? yeah it's in your dying days you you want the truth right? she'd say yeah er I definitely want the truth the truth is erm yes go on then but
A	yeah
B	yeah that that would be a completely hard one because
B	er
A	what's the er Karl Marx quote you know? religion is the opiate of the people or the opium something like that cos the people
B	yeah
A	people get
B	yeah
A	you know they're addicted to it
A	sometimes we should let the truth what did he say? I dunno after you know he told that man that erm that the letter
B	yeah
A	that that that that girl wrote him he burned it or whatever and it's like sometimes you've just got we should start trying to outsmart the truth I dunno something like that
B	well no cos the the end of The Dark Knight the er
A	I think everyone has their own like role in Gotham City though
B	yeah
A	bosses there's there's the rich and the aristocrats like Bruce Wayne's family
B	yeah
A	and everyone lives but it's only when it starts getting unfair and worse for people obviously the people at the bottom like you know they always talk about Gotham's underbelly it's when it gets worse for them that's when Batman chooses to do something other times
B	well didn't he
A	or in or or like in Gotham er you know erm Jim Gordon's meant to be you know the symbol of absolute er
B	yeah
A	good good morality but yet in the end he chooses to allow Falcone to live on because the city needs him
B	yeah
A	so that's being pragmatic that's being smart about it that's erm
B	but the world the world needs two types of heroes one
B	it does it well one
A	the ones it deserves and the ones
B	no no the the ones that that will give the world the people of the world hope right? the figures right?
A	yeah
B	so your Mandelas your er your Martin Luther Kings your your er
A	Gandhis
B	your Gandhis yeah? people you you need that right? people that are absolute right? they might not have the greatest change sometimes their actions may be negative but at the end of the day they're the they're the the be-all and end-all the absolute figure of of good right?
A	yeah
B	and then other times you need people that are gonna do the dirty work that the people that at the end of the day aren't gonna be looked on as heroes because their actions aren't inherently heroic when you look at it erm cos you need those kind of people because at the end of the day those are the ones that are gonna get stuff done
B	I mean it's all good well and good giving speeches and stuff but unless you you you have a
A	and which of those do you think is Batman?
A	no but I think he I think he makes a transition from er Dark Knight he chose to do
B	yeah
A	the dark that people didn't want him to do
B	mm
A	you know he was the Dark Knight whereas er two
B	yeah
A	and then in Dark Knight Rises he ends up becoming a symbol because
B	yeah
A	he hasn't been there for so long a symbol of what's right
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	but people like orphans and er and er and some of the good cops they knew that Batman was really
B	yeah
A	the good person and you know he stood for a symbol as much
B	yeah
A	and er yeah and then you go back to Batman Begins and I think the reason why er er Bruce Wayne was first said he was gonna take on the Batman was cos he had become a symbol
B	yeah
A	for more than more than just going out and fighting crime
B	yeah
A	and obviously Alfred preferred that cos he'd get less hurt and stuff erm
B	yeah I know but but erm
A	right
B	they would never again erm
A	yeah I suppose
B	do do do wrong but yeah obviously in the end he becomes a a symbol of of hope but originally er
A	maybe at the end of the third movie when he's finally sacrificed himself
B	yeah
A	and they do that statue of him
B	mm
A	maybe that's the the final only time when he
B	yeah
A	becomes hope
B	yeah
A	I think Superman's meant to be the symbol of hope
B	yeah
A	but he's so much more boring and placid and dull
B	it is yeah
A	cos that is it
B	he is the ultimate be all of end of all of good you know he he does
A	at least Batman admits he has faults
B	yeah
A	Superman messes up all the time too
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er
A	it's just cos he's more popular
B	yeah he's got so much more depth
A	yeah
A	his villains are better
B	he gets better writers
A	yep
B	better movies
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	which is which is nice but like The Dark Knight Returns is a really good one
A	oh yeah
B	if you if you read or watch that
A	I actually need
A	oh right yeah
B	because he goes from being like
A	yeah
B	and er
A	cos he's old
A	do you think it's gonna it's not gonna spoil any of the Superman versus but I know that they said that the Superman versus Batman film is its own independent story that the writers created and it shouldn't be looked at like with comic book history at all or something they're basically
B	well basically selling the exact same fight scene that they're they're gonna lift from
A	right
B	from er dynamic and
A	I think they should like separate themselves from
A	they're just trying to move er the idea of cos they I dunno they're trying to pretend that they're better than Marvel movies
B	yeah
A	cos Marvel movies have become I really like them but they've become really mainstream
B	yeah cashed out but
A	yeah and like like comical and erm like one of main DC people were just like yeah
B	yeah
A	you know like we're gonna make a film that stands for the values that DC films stands for erm faithfulness to their comics erm like good plotlines and good characters or something like that
B	oh I never read
A	I can't
B	read Marvel comics but I can't see why they wouldn't achieve that
A	I know
B	oh er yeah
A	right? or it's just the characters are better
B	the the characters are better and they're better written
A	then why can't they make a successful DCCU?
B	because erm because they they look at what they think works and they they look at what
A	in their field
B	at how what the yeah they look at The Dark Knight and seen how like dark it was compared to the
B	the Marvel universe
A	that's really bad
B	er er and they've look at at what they wanna be as in comparison to Marvel and try to differentiate themselves erm
A	too much though
B	er and and then they completely overshot
A	yeah I think I think they've got the wrong end of the picture the success of The Dark Knight films
B	well yeah which is which is why the Suicide Squad trailer looks so so dark and boring and and no comedy
A	they just need to come out with a really funny movie
B	yeah be good
A	maybe they tried it with Green Lantern but they just didn't put enough time into it
B	yeah
A	you know so they tried the flamboyant
B	yeah
A	Marvel like movies like Green Lantern and failed they they tried it with serious Dark Knight and it was the biggest like
B	yeah
A	box office they'd ever had so I can see why they're doing it didn't really work with Man of Steel though did it? I mean
B	yeah that
A	did you see that that video of like the the different colour tones they had?
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah yeah yeah like
A	yeah
B	and
A	just don't want them to F it up
B	yeah it looks that way
A	so so what's Arrow like do you think? is that like serious?
B	well it it it it's oh
A	yeah okay
B	so it's not you know like Dark Knight but you can't achieve that level of darkness just with
A	just by creating it
B	one hour slots you need to the whole thing about a movie is that you build it using sounds cinematography throughout a consistent sustained like two three hours
A	yeah yeah
B	er and and you use that to make people you know feel a certain way and and respond a certain way and you can't really do that as well with a series because it's it's broken up you can you can try
A	you have more time though to develop the characters like
B	you can develop a character which is is great but you can't
A	but not yeah yeah
A	mm
B	use like erm filters or cinematography or or the the way light shines or whatever to to make it look like you know use that to tell a story because
A	yeah I get you
B	it's not sustained
A	yeah I get you apparently the action scenes are amazing though
B	yeah they're really they're really well done
A	yeah
B	but it's got to the point where it's a bit of a joke though
A	really?
B	yeah cos it's just like it used to be like really like oh wow that's amazing but then you do it all the time and so
A	what and you get used to it?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah?
B	there's this one scene where where he shoots an arrow up into the sky right
A	what?
A	yeah yeah
B	he just grapples something
A	so it's pretty cheap
B	no you you
A	cheap trick
B	you can you can see as well like my
A	yeah
B	and it it shows from series one till three like
A	that's why I dunno but I really want Gotham to work
B	I don't think
A	I think if season two they're gonna really find themselves
B	I've watched just a lot of cop cop erm series
A	oh right oh right oh right
B	yeah it just it just
B	it fits straight into there it's like nothing different it really isn't
A	yeah but it's in Gotham
B	yeah I know but you can you can just move it somewhere else but it's the same thing
A	nah
B	you basically every every episode was just oh there's a crime a a completely unrelated crime to the main plot let's go and solve that
A	I I think they really do it pretty well I mean some episodes you completely disjointed but
B	yeah I know but
A	others they were like
B	it was too much
A	it was leading to the Penguin thing
B	it was too much just like a cop show like erm
A	I I was pretty invested in Penguin and
B	yeah I I I I know but but the like the bulk of the show the bulk like seventy percent was just a cop show
A	yeah
B	it was like oh crime here let's go oh that guy's a stereotypical guy that's probably done it
A	yeah
B	so we'll go and put him we'll question him oh wait it this evidence says it could be
A	I know but
B	him
A	they only have like forty minutes as well like
B	oh no there's this creepy guy
A	an hour
B	who was walking around let's go find this creepy guy he was the murderer now let's chase him through a load of oh he's shoot at him oh no he he he punched Bullock in the face oh and then in the end Gordon saying Gordon says but hang on and they arrest him and they get the man
A	so what do you think they should what
B	move away from the
A	I think they're gonna get more into the villains which er more in-depth villains than you know the Balloonman or a goat or a a Professor Pyg or whatever
B	yeah I
A	cos they didn't they didn't really
B	I just don't I don't
A	the whole Dollmaker thing didn't work that wasn't long enough
B	yeah I just don't really form that thing well
A	yeah
B	because people have seen it too many times but I really think they
A	I'd see it again though
B	you you you never watched US Office but the first season they they tried to copy exactly what the first season of the original Office was
A	yeah
B	and it was awful
A	oh
B	it it was completely terrible because
A	is that just cos it was American though?
B	yeah because it was an
A	yeah
B	it was tried and tested comedy but they tried to do it the exact same and emulate it and it was awful
A	wasn't that just because like Americans and British people have different humour though?
B	not but but the well my point is that they would they they tried to copy something that was tried and tested
A	right yeah
B	right? erm and it ended up just being so boring
A	yeah
B	because of that er and in the second season they did so they they they created a series that was completely different from from the er
A	god
B	the British er British season er series and it was it was almost apart from characters and the the
A	well it reminds me of er
B	yeah you've gotta tap
A	oh right and so it reminds me of The Inbetweeners when they tried to do The Inbetweeners in America
B	that's it now
A	either
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah when they tried to do er The Inbetweeners
B	yeah
A	in America it was
B	yeah
A	awful
B	that always happens cos there's this stupid
A	yeah
B	but the second they try and use the British humour and did it it was awful
A	yeah
B	like Steve Carell is hilarious but the second they try and make him do British humour he was just terrible
A	yeah
B	but then the second they let him do his own thing he
A	that's why Ben Affleck has to be an amazing Batman because we're gonna be invested in
B	yeah
A	for at least another two movies
B	yeah I really hope they
A	I don't think he's doing that like Suicide Squad I don't think he's doing that
B	but also
A	I think he's trying to just stay as far away from Heath Ledger as he can
B	but also don't go the other way and make it so far away from him because you're scared of of of going anywhere into his territory that
A	I know yeah
B	it's just it it it's no longer the character that you were you were looking for that's why they should just make it funny right? cos cos like I get that it's really hard to be funny
A	oh yeah
B	like really hard but
A	it's
B	so maybe that's why
A	I still do it I manage
B	but maybe that's why they try and stay away from it but
A	yeah
B	cos Heath Ledger was like a one-time thing and
A	are you getting the er forty-one yeah?
B	the
A	er the forty-one get off at er
B	it'll be it'll be it'll be the same time for me that oh are you getting off at
A	no cos then cos erm
B	the train will be coming through
A	there's other trains that run just from
B	oh right erm
A	oh
B	so but is that going to
A	yeah
B	oh right okay er oh yeah you get on that one I'll get on the
A	alright
B	the eight-fifty
A	alright
B	bye-bye
