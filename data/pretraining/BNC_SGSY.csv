A	okay so that's great in the context of what we saw as an er that example on the foundation erm for the job for a developer which was erm that they were displaying that people were happy to help and so what you're doing is you are providing people through this film's video this chat with somebody a storyline that demonstrates to somebody well how I could go about it so they might not be aware of but they can see through somebody else's example erm if I went and had a chat to my lecturer about the idea I have and I get over a particular barrier that I've got then I might be able to er er well I'll I will be able to find out and know whether it's something that's feasible that I can go forward with
B	mm
A	or I can have a chat to that guy
B	mm
A	and get to know him et cetera et cetera
B	mm
A	and the other thing that you were talking about is is kind
B	yeah
A	and then you could sum it up at the end of the week with either a Google Hangout type thing where they all get together
B	mm
A	and yet they have some common thing in and that you can draw together which is what their network actually means
B	yeah it's like a Chinese whispers like you could do say you know Monday to Friday or or whatever
B	mm
A	a person each day
B	right
A	six six times so that means the person at the end of the process has six degrees separated from the first person
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you can explore all of that connection
B	yeah
A	but what does that actually mean? what does that provide people?
B	well it provides them with erm
A	communicate
B	communicate and make connections and what they do with the connections cos it's easy to just connect with someone on Facebook
A	mm
B	and that is a community that's building something at least at least that's showing a growth in the area that technology does have connectedness but what you do with that connectedness that counts
A	and and there's a big thing that you feed off that thread which is erm all of those elements of the student-ish type things which are about your your learning your motivation your erm getting on and doing it your experience your sharing your community your networking and all of those
B	mm
A	of people
B	mm
A	or whatever
B	it it I think it works on the level
A	you could take it in that circle
B	that the story the narrative is driving is driving the growth so it's it's actually other people who are just er who stories every time they contribute something that story is being you have to have a good sense of narrative but in a way people are driving their own narrative it's not me or you who is sitting there going okay in the next video we want this to happen it's actually going to be quite impromptu
A	well and that kind of goes back to what we were talking about erm kinda
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	and that on this particular week we would like everybody to
B	mm
A	and then you start at one point and you don't know where this going to go
B	yeah
A	but it's gonna thread through the community and come up with something
B	yeah
A	and so you draw the whole community into this whole this this observation of it all
B	yeah
A	and that
B	yeah
A	well I was going to
B	so what I'm saying is that you know
A	yeah erm I think it's also got the potential to demonstrate a different way of going about doing something and it erm if you take that idea of a short video which tells you a lot in a short period of time yeah and then you scale that to the size of a whole community of several thousand people
B	mm
A	right and you so you're stretching that story from from being this short to taking a longer period of time but scaling it in such a way that that the learning you get out of this bigger thing is massive compared to this tiny little piece of time
B	that's true
A	even if it is just the the difference between two minutes to a week
B	yeah
A	right?
B	yeah
A	so you could you could say you've got this mechanism by which erm you could even call it a business thread er way to er brainstorm ideas such that by the end of a week you've come up with some kind of proactive brand new idea that you could use as a thread to follow on down a path to start a new business or something
B	mm
A	er whatever I
B	it's the difference between it just made me think of quite a few things that
A	I I remember this yeah
B	now the
A	I've seen that
A	and that's what you pin is your your products
B	right
A	you know you you go you get them to chat first
B	yeah
A	you could you could just do this as an experiment tomorrow
B	yeah
A	and you could see what comes out of it and you could erm synthesise it all and you could go okay I can see five products there that we could do tomorrow
B	yeah
A	and that and and then you can so those five ideas you're going to carry out some kind of analysis on to decide which one you're gonna go with
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and we what we can do is we can cherry-pick the ones that we wanna offer ourselves so you can say straight up hey guys like thing is is that this is our areas of expertise like English language stuff that's what I can help out with erm I can help out with
A	and that goes back to what you saw there are people displaying what their skill base is and saying happy to help and that immediately provides a mechanism for people to connect
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	erm that provides an ongoing network of of which is kind of
B	well the other thing is is that you can help
A	it's a more it's a more day-to-day live mechanism
B	it it's an evidence base so that when you go to get a job
A	your portfolio mm
B	erm if you wanna be a filmmaker you have to have er what they call a show reel
A	mm
B	there's nothing wrong with the idea of pushing through a product for young people which is how do I sell myself without using the stereotypical CV which is very hard to really make yourself look appealing
A	okay so that's where the attraction is for our idea all of this is contained within our our framework okay?
B	yeah
A	people can only access it through our framework
B	yeah
A	so they can only reference our framework to their employer to demonstrate this is what I've done as a part of this product
B	yeah
A	we own the product
B	oh okay
A	yeah?
B	yeah it's an exploratory product and it's not it's not obviously
A	yeah well we have to
B	something CV yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and so I'm sure erm
B	and it's hard for young people to write anything on it
A	I'm sure in creative the creative world I mean I I was listening to how some people actively engage in interview their people they want to work for them right? and these are you know and they're obviously trying to bring very bright people on board but I have never ever come across anybody who was interviewed in such a way and
B	ah see that's actually really clever too because if we start off with the interview thing that you know there's the person who's interviewing like me
A	and that's the great thing about Mixergy is and
B	yeah
A	and and it er provides that it's
B	right
A	so he's saying the cream of the crop okay?
B	mm
A	and so he
B	yeah
A	it's all about the psychology of
B	yeah
A	how you think how you do things
B	yeah
A	how you relate to people the relationships and what you think okay? and maybe your ability to challenge ideas
B	mm
A	erm but that provides somebody that mechanism to to to to discuss that scope
B	mm
A	so going back to what you were saying is that erm through these interviews online you can demonstrate those examples by which people can learn from
B	yeah I think it's better because in a way you have
A	I don't like framing in the context of a CV but it provides people an awareness of communication at that level
B	er yeah erm
A	it would just be a website of yourself with a video on it and
B	yeah
A	other resources
B	yeah
A	and so we're
A	website
B	yeah or we could even fashion a product which says look this is actually what you need to do as a kind of format to get yourself across in the best light rather when we saw the
A	absolutely of course and that would have demonstrated things
B	so what I would say is that it is we can encourage that product to come through
A	mm
B	as an exploratory product
A	that's right
B	that allows people to be creative co-create because they can then evidence the way that they've worked with their peers the way that they've worked with people who are older than them and most importantly I think the things that they can safely say are their strengths you can almost look someone in the eye and go
A	who's saying that?
B	there's a lot of psychology behind that now that's why everyone wants to make videos and put them on the internet
A	there are examples in there though of where seeing wasn't believing in my point of view and
B	right
A	and and that was because they you know there was like the lady who got
B	no
A	there there's no there's no actual quality behind that
B	but it's a good idea
A	yeah
B	and that's actually a really
A	but but with that roundedness to it
B	yeah
A	it would be a strong idea
B	well that's a good way of actually showing
A	and that goes back to that lady's
B	but I don't know if that's true
A	she
B	I mean you know I
B	mm
A	she's trying to say the eighty percent that are actually otherwise there
B	mm
A	that aren't er you know they aren't at university or dealing in an academic sense are operating in such a way that is like that and you see that in the real world you see that in business you see that on the street you see that on the train you see it on the day-to-day thing simply walking down the street looking at their phone
B	mm
A	so you're you're right about the students erm
B	okay so like say if we say a dogma is we
A	mm
B	that means that the
A	well that shapes the the rules for the interview which is quite simple if you asked them a question that they're unhappy answering they will just say I'm not gonna answer that
B	yeah yeah
A	and and that's fine and you do find examples with Mixergy sometimes where he has to go back and say I'm sorry I've had to edit this out because I was pushing a point that didn't
B	yeah okay
A	okay
B	yeah
A	it explored something on the basis of of some erroneous research or whatever
B	okay
A	yeah so he has to make er that's errors and omissions
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but that's the way it works so it's fine
B	but what's good about this is that where we can add more credibility particularly cos they're younger people and younger people might not be as believable as older people even though it's unfair to say is that if we use this idea of of connecting Monday to Tuesday and Tuesday to Wednesday Wednesday to Thursday the credibility is lent by the relationships so when we meet
A	and you get that with nearly every interview that you hear online that the people who are being interviewed and the people who are interviewing them have either met them in the past or they've met people that they know in common and that's hence how they are interviewing them
B	mm
A	it's not by chance
B	mm
A	so erm that demonstrates exactly your point
B	mm
A	most of the time
B	right okay
A	mm
B	you hear them you know my friend or I know this guy or ah and have you heard of this yes I do buy that guy's product you know I do like this stuff you know so they find common points of interest
B	okay
A	how relationships connect
B	yes
A	and networks are built
B	yes and how communication is the vehicle for that to happen
A	okay
B	it does involve a lot to do with courtesy politeness there's lots of things in there
B	like sort of growing an awareness of business etiquette you know if you're nineteen you might be feeling like you're on top of the world but you need to be able to show a respect to your elders et cetera et
A	okay
B	yeah
A	erm and that can be people that are either internal to universities or external and work in business and can be good er
B	sorry
A	role models et cetera et cetera
B	yes absolutely
A	yeah?
B	mentors
A	all of that stuff
B	yeah
A	yeah so that
B	yeah
A	erm and connects a lot better from our point of view as a business model to er other things
B	yeah
A	yeah just hold on a sec dude
B	okay so this is gonna be quite interesting because
B	because if we were to do a trial run of it and it did just happen by chance that students wanted to
A	and that's great
B	and you leave it just like that like a cliffhanger
A	mm
B	you've gotta leave it like that
A	yes
B	so the audience are looking at going I wonder if the lecturer will say yes I really hope the lecturer will say yes cos I wanna know what the lecturer's gonna say about the student
A	and if you wanted to you could like wait a whole week or two weeks and you can thread of that story through each of your subsequent interviews
B	right
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	or references at the end
B	yeah
A	and that's a time where you can provide that ongoing connection
B	yeah recap recap
A	and this is where it's heading to
B	recap
A	you can recap that
B	yeah
A	and you can provide a little
B	yeah
A	that thread of interest
B	or something like
A	you know
B	well what would you do now if this was you? what would you be thinking of your next step? how would you be going about setting something up? and just always getting those kind of like out there kind of questions to people erm
A	and it could be somebody is interested in how the heck did you become a
B	yeah
A	how could I connect with people who are doing it?
B	yeah
A	and
B	mm
A	when
B	mm
A	so when you get to this point it's more than just grades it's gotta be more than just
B	oh yeah
A	getting getting top As
B	yeah
A	and being accepted into something
B	mm
A	or being headhunted by a corporation it's providing yourself the best possible foundation on which you can jump out of education into the real world
B	mm
A	erm and there are many many examples of you know people who are gonna want to er get a good job work for a corporation work for a big place work for a small place work in community work on volunteer basis travel all sorts of different things
B	yeah
A	threads er and this er they're gonna wanna start their own companies the the young guy there who was talking about you know I want to develop interstellar you know travel or whatever it is
B	yeah
A	you know it's big picture thinking but it's a lot of psychology behind all of that
B	yeah
A	and er that you're trying to run this thread which can take people from the start of university age they're learning from their peers that are above them
B	yeah
A	and this is something I was taught when we were at school we used to have we
B	yeah
A	school
B	yeah
A	and to be their mentors
B	yeah
A	and so you're creating this learn from each other experience which I think gets lost it does get lost because because universities are intrinsically erm segregated societies they are built of faculties er there's not much cross faculty interaction that even within the faculties quite often it wasn't uncommon for people who were doing masters or PhDs didn't even talk to any of the undergrads
B	yeah that's true
A	only when they had a job as tutor or a lecturer
B	yeah
A	did they do so
B	yeah not much has changed
A	and otherwise everybody was hiding in their corner
B	mm
A	and they were not sharing anything with anybody else
B	no because in some disciplines you are not encouraged to
A	well this becomes a it's a matter of managing competitive advantage
B	mm
A	and things like that
B	mm
A	however
B	mm
A	and that has got to be
B	a waste
A	that's er such a waste
B	yeah there's a lot of wastage
A	yeah
B	in intellectual thought
A	and if if if you consider er a lot of the the kind of discussions that go on at universities and a in a public forum sense and predominantly around erm er
B	can
A	when you're trying to get students
B	can you write that down?
A	what I was saying?
B	cos I think that's a quite a a thought-provoking there's a lot of wastage in intellectual thought
A	there is a lot of wastage
B	waste er waste
B	in intellectual thought
A	intellectual thought
B	that will get someone thinking what does that mean?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah there is there is
A	er and that's the same kind of thing that you're brought up on through you start school and it's an us and them they are the old ones you're the you're the newcomers
B	mm but
A	and then you go to university and it's the same thing and then you start in business and it's the same thing
B	but everyone knows
A	and
B	the the this won't change if you get on with your form tutor as a pupil you'll do well
A	mm
B	if you get on with your lecturer at university or a lecturer you'll do well
A	mm
B	if you get on with your boss at work you'll do well
A	and the reason why
B	but that doesn't change any time
A	er but
B	yeah
A	and and I think quite often they're it's probably because by default they are a kind of mentor whether it's formally or informally
B	mm
A	erm and of course with a mentor you will learn things because there's somebody who's showing you the way
B	mm
A	so if you can create something that exists on a bit by bit basis which is erm using that ladder within the university to share knowledge from top to bottom I didn't last year and this is what it was like these are the things you could learn you know without it being a a a a mechanism to plagiarise stuff or whatever
B	mm yeah
A	but it is about that of community people learning life skills which is learning and being a continuous learner and sharing their knowledge with others sharing is the important thing
B	yeah yeah and I actually you know what there's so many mentor programmes at universities around the world
A	they become diluted
B	they're very diluted and they're not actually visible
A	exactly
B	they only have like award nights at the end of the semester where only a handful of bigwigs come down and it's all a bit tongue-in-cheek and it's a just a bit staged
A	my example is er when I started the job here erm somebody er at the time was a proactive HR person who said everybody who wants a mentor put your hand up and I'll try and connect you with a mentor
B	yeah
A	erm and but not related in a context of a departmental
B	mm
A	context or anything like that now that could be a good thing or a bad thing
B	mm
A	however there was never any forum for you to actually meet together unless it was both of you doing it so all she was was a go-between
B	mm
A	she wasn't facilitating anything really
B	mm I had that at
A	yeah
B	and I had a mentor I never met with them the whole time I was there
A	and this is so you didn't have a mentor
B	no I didn't
A	so but and that's where the failure is in the whole thing
B	but the reason why is cos it felt fake cos I'd been assigned someone
A	and I have felt exactly the same thing
B	I felt it better to find my own mentor
A	mm and you may do that and some people may do that but some people don't have the confidence to do that so by providing a mechanism which is related to you are just a year ahead of me then that's a an easier relationship than you've already gone so far
B	yeah
A	or you are the expert
B	yeah
A	and I've got this massive gulf to cross over
B	yeah
A	to meet you in the middle and you're still way ahead of me when I meet you in the middle
B	well actually you're right because
A	you know
B	when you're probably
A	that's like breaking down er into a smaller problem
B	it it is it's breaking down the relationships into more explicit erm
A	and it fits in within the block of six
B	yeah
A	have the potential to
B	are also relevant mentors
A	be very relevant yeah yeah
B	it's not always looking for the person who is the director
A	well it can help a whole community
B	yeah and that's another thing that we can explore is by unpacking those relationships people learn how relationships get put together they can start to form their own ideas of how to put their own relationships together and most importantly of all this is what we have to learn is how to maintain relationships
A	mm
B	mm
A	and that's just something for your work-related stuff but is it something that can have some kind of benefit to what we're doing or is it just something on the side something else?
B	like what?
A	I dunno I just just the topic of what is being filmed for you know does that actually interrelate with anything that we're thinking of?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yes or no
A	yes
B	and that's always the end
A	mm mm
B	and that's the story the story either goes somewhere or it doesn't it's just the way the story is being driven people will drive it forward
A	mm
B	and that's true because if
A	what are you talking about
B	well
A	we're not we're not dealing with children
B	no I know but it's gotta be it you know it's gotta be clear that you don't we don't interview children
A	okay erm
B	but I think to get the story going it's a it's a much broader topic not just about academic integrity but you have to phrase the topic in a way that encourages people to ask others to be interviewed so I would probably refine that by saying something like erm
A	yeah so that I mean that that is the the kind of the service that you're trying to provide for the community and solving some people some some particular problems that the community are telling you about
B	yeah
A	erm so so that's that's it's interesting that erm
B	mm
A	through a thin line that you're just steering the community to that side of the business
B	mm
A	but that's really giving the attraction
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	I think what you do is once you've started to get a feeling for what
A	the problems are
B	the problem are and the solutions you start to go and the background to the interviewees do you wanna co-create?
A	as a resource
B	through this website?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes that's quite possible erm and like with the
B	yeah
A	and all we were thinking about was sharing a conversation we weren't trying to present any particular learnings from it
B	yeah
A	but there is something valuable in there to learn about
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah of course
A	so he he's he's cleverly allowing his community to build his own product for him
B	yeah well my initial reaction is what I was asking you to do before you went off and did the other thing but it was to make
A	what other thing?
B	erm
A	mm
B	and the reason why you would do that is because
A	mm
B	and you sell this at a premium
A	mm
B	because it's real
A	who are you selling it to?
B	higher education institutions
A	right okay
B	because their online content
A	and it's not essentially scripted
B	a producer yeah
A	yeah mm uh-mm cos
B	but this is different this is not me writing the script it's not you writing the script it's the people who have agreed to co-create a a moving images
A	who who who's the creator sorry?
B	the creators are the people who have been in Monday to
A	this is through the centre of your thread?
B	yeah
A	and then they're and then you're creating a case study related to that interview process
B	yeah but you edit it
A	that you've explored
B	you you edit it into a narrative at that point it's become
A	mm
B	you see how it can go wherever it goes?
A	yes of course
B	we just don't know but the point is is that once you start
A	er if it works in a business model then fine
B	well if it's using a music a music model you know you're gonna have people who are getting a lot of money from selling an album
A	yeah well that that's a very old and stagnant and dying business model
B	alright so how are bands afloat nowadays
A	erm
B	alright
A	the difference is that it's being shared more but also there are less true musicians around and there's more tat which is being created by production companies or recording companies yeah?
B	okay
A	which is you know they do a short-term business-related Hollywood-style we invest this much we get this much out of it it lives and dies a short life
B	right
A	you know?
B	okay well somewhere in there
A	an example of getting around this is like Spotify or Netflix using subscription models okay? so they're providing people access to get around a music problem which was that they were making the content not getting money for it because it was getting pirated and the argument goes that because somebody is getting some money out of it that's better than getting no money out of it so it still gets pirated but more people pay a small amount to use it through a subscription model
B	yeah alright well
A	it means that it's some
B	there's there's some somewhere between there and there and publishing there is a model for us to sell to higher education institutions
A	mm
B	there is a model because what you're providing is a high quality content which will engage with a student target group
A	professionals
B	and professionals
A	mm
B	erm no not only are you going to be able to provide some learning to fill some stuff that's gonna be difficult for you to fill otherwise but certainly it's also giving you that warm touchy friendly feeling because everybody wants to say oh we are a lovely university and we are so friendly with our students and they love us
A	mm mm
B	cos the one thing that you can you know and you should
A	mm of course
B	and they're also very rip er offable as well
A	yes
B	and the reason
