A	yeah so it was funny when you said
B	bit weird
A	um let's try it over here
B	yeah
B	I didn't
A	it's like
B	I know but I don't really like them like
A	and you like turned your nose up at every
B	I know but I don't like ones that are like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah uh they've sort of got a curvy arm and um
B	can't think of the name
A	like a soft
B	haven't been here for
A	Don't really
B	no
B	I'm sick of those those signs
A	you what?
B	those signs
A	ah right
B	like Keep Calm And Carry On was the original one
A	I didn't really notice it that much
B	but like I I read an article by Charlie Brooker that he was like really vitriolic about
A	vitriolic? He's he's vitriolic about all uh things isn't he?
B	well of course but
A	what exactly is it that annoys him about keeping calm?
B	no no it's just that it's just like
A	why should we keep calm? I mean for God's sake
B	no it's not about keeping calm it's about those posters
A	everyone's making amusing posters are they?
B	those like Keep Calm And you know like play sports or if you're into sports or Keep Calm And Knit if you're a knitter say
A	yeah
B	they've just become quite ubiquitous I think
A	yeah
B	it was a better episode though
A	uh
B	although I fell asleep a bit
A	um
B	it was funny when you woke us up when I was on the sofa
A	the um Something Show
B	ten o'clock
A	live at? Not Live From Studio Five that's something else
B	no Ten o'clock
A	yeah
B	but I woke with a real start like when you woke  when you woke  us up
A	yeah think that's cos I sort of tripped and sort of fell on you a bit
B	did you?
A	rather than
B	that's naughty
A	sort of like
B	waking us up gently
A	gently
B	yeah
A	so um
B	yeah
A	uh there's usually a football on isn't there? What although actually
B	there's some final on on Sunday like some somebody's cup final
B	there's that many cups
A	would it be?
B	it's Liverpool versus Swansea City or something
A	it's not the the um
B	maybe yeah
A	um
B	milk Cup
A	yeah you wouldn't call it that if you'd won it though
B	eh? You wouldn't call it that if you've won it
A	no
A	isn't it like cos
B	yeah
A	quite a lot of people
B	got an email from Tosh today
A	yeah?
B	just the usual rubbish
A	he's always
B	saying that he'd
A	that's funny cos he doesn't actually know anything about your thesis does he?
B	well he knows what it was on doesn't he? And um
A	where's that then? In Australia?
B	in Huddersfield
A	ah Huddersfield?
B	and um said she was doing like Yorkshire stuff
B	and then he said Ah me friend did a PhD on whatever
A	no well
B	but uh
A	oh right
B	and he was like Have you told
B	well everyone has that's why like
B	if I had friends who were normal then they would be boring wouldn't they? Nobody you know
A	I mean no one is normal that's that's my point you see
B	no I know
A	trying to think you know like who's the most normal
B	it depends what you mean by normal like do you mean like sort of calm and like rational? Or do you mean like stereotypical or do you mean?
A	um
B	Cos I've got friends who are rational and sort of sensible
A	I guess yeah certainly like part of it you'd have to have like you couldn't be um couldn't be stupid
B	yeah
A	but um
B	yeah
A	but then that's very broad as well um
B	yeah
A	to to be normal um
B	mhm
A	um
B	no I don't think so
A	no I mean just the fact that you're in a family makes you more normal maybe
B	think so?
A	normal
B	I don't know if I agree
A	might do
B	Cos everyone's in a family everyone's got a family
A	I guess there's more  there's more  like more than one type of normal that you are in like
B	yeah
A	stereotypes
B	yeah
A	uh uh
B	student yeah
A	scientist or something
B	ooh I found this website today
A	is it like I think there's nothing much that you can say really about about
B	oh that's true yeah
A	no never heard of it
B	it's really good like you'll probably not like it it but it's it's where like you can put like
A	right
B	and you create your own little pin board
A	right
B	and like of all different things like so people might've done their hair nice and then taken a photo of it or
A	shall I go on the pin board then?
B	and you can like you can put things on your own pin board
A	so it's basically it's kinda like a  like a  blog
B	yeah but it's just pictures
A	I see
B	and like you can use it to like if you were creating
A	uh yeah I think I've used uh whether you can use it like a wiki you mean work with other people?
B	so if you were like looking for inspiration for
A	yeah
B	so if you were having a thing
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	you can pinch theirs and pin it on yours as well
A	yeah
B	like if you're
A	yeah?
B	lots of like hair things lots of really good clothes and
A	so it's like my my pictures
B	it's kind of yeah but it's it looks really nice and snazzy
A	oh right
B	it's uh
A	so it could
B	I think so but like you can also add your own things and like if you were collaborating on like a project or something like
A	oh yeah I think so yeah
B	I think that you can do things like that on there
A	so you you sort of put notes on? Yeah
B	yeah you put notes under the things
A	um
B	it can also link it to something else like if you took a picture of like a
A	we we did we not already have this sort of before but not maybe with the ability to put them all on next to each other or something?
B	oh right yeah of course you can save a folder of photos but it's you can sort of display them nicely and like
A	yeah
B	I haven't explored it fully but it looks good
B	baby hedgehogs and stuff
A	you could go to a specialist site and like if you've seen a good hedgehog or made a good cake then you could go to a specialist hedgehog or cake site that you can  you can  sort of compete and put your own cake and your own hedgehog
B	yeah yeah of course
A	yeah? Yeah
B	so like you can search on their site for
A	I see
B	you know um
A	I can kind of see it although I think probably myself I would go to a specific hedgehog site
B	oh no I know
A	yeah
B	you know just all different things like
A	yeah yeah okay yeah
B	I struggle with like things to do like to read and
A	yeah you need suggestions yeah like you mean
B	yeah
A	like if you were looking on cooking you know it would  it would  tend not to really have a proper recipe for something if you were looking on
B	yeah
A	to be honest if you were looking on anything
B	yeah
A	ultimately in any profession or any field of science
B	yeah
A	you're ultimately gonna get to the point where you would be wanting to do something
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and they'd like they had one picture on the front but then when you clicked it it had like ten different pictures and showed you all the different steps
A	yeah
B	you know so like
A	yeah
B	but obviously like if you went to the create Wikipedia page on like updos or whatever
B	hairdos
A	like cosmetics as well like there wasn't a page for um
B	soap And Glory
A	soap And Glory that I knew about for example
B	yeah
A	uh so but but you don't you use Wikipedia for for finding methods you use it for um
B	yeah
A	just general like broad sort of knowledge
B	yeah
A	but
B	but I bet there's a side to that I mean I've only really like I only really found Pinterest today so I was just like
A	should uh should d'you reckon I should have another or d'you wanna
B	if you'd like one yeah
A	balance it out or?
B	have you got any cash or d'you wanna borrow some? I think I've got some I went to the cashpoint and risked me life
A	I might actually
B	have you? I've I dunno
A	three forty
B	yeah
A	hold on
B	sure? Well take that just in case
A	okay
B	then you can give us it back

B	yeah

B	I just told you these a second ago
A	oh did you? Was was they on the list?
B	sorry?
B	I did I just
A	when was
B	the fourth
A	okay
A	there's a lot  there's a lot  who have birthdays at the end of November anyway
B	actually I'm not sure
A	I know
B	I know like a few people I used to be friends with
A	yeah
A	it's a good one to you know like man on a horse
A	there must be  there must be  someone more more famous than Jamie Theakston
B	I dunno he's just one that sticks in me mind
A	there's a guy who had a birthday um
B	yeah
A	oh yeah um it was uh it was like a sine wave
B	oh Hertz
A	yeah
B	yeah I saw that
A	yeah
B	did you ever see that one that was to celebrate um the graphic novelist what's he called? It was really long and you had to like press buttons and do things
A	is that the one that went
B	it was like a machine?
A	I think there was one with Jules Verne
B	oh it wasn't Jules Verne
A	where he went down  he went down  to the bottom of the sea or something and then uh there was like a
B	oh that's pretty good
A	there was like a full-on
B	can't remember his name
A	oh right yeah just not not can't think positively or?
B	like some days I get to work and I'm like do this do this do this
A	yeah
B	and like it's and I just like
A	yeah
B	like I was reading somewhere that in like um in Norway like okay you get your annual holiday allowance and stuff but you get three days like three duvet days when you can just ring up and say d'you know what I just  I just  don't wanna come to work today
B	so you can use them as holiday if you want
A	okay
B	no but you can ring on the morning
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah but you could go home at lunchtime and use half of your duvet day
A	um yeah yeah I do yeah yeah
B	you could like be like I haven't done anything any more today I can't do this afternoon I'm just gonna home like
A	guess it you can learn a lot by
B	obviously you can't have duvet days if you're like a nurse but like
B	like a brain surgeon but you've just got like an office job
A	you can learn a lot by by reading reading about um the practices of other countries like
B	yeah
A	uh the Scandinavian ones are pretty
B	but I just like that idea like cos you know some days when you wake up and you just don't feel like it
A	that's that was it I mean  I mean  you get bad days when although you may not always know that it's gonna be one but
B	no
A	you get a bad and things that it you get in a negative frame of mind and things seem to
B	yeah
A	it was more like a bored day?
B	like everything was okay but I just
A	yeah
B	I have got some side projects
B	no but I got one of those special wipes
A	that's
B	no it was a wipe
A	yeah
B	I emptied the crumbs off it though
A	fair enough
B	yeah
A	yeah I mine's uh
B	cleaned all the ming under my
A	you don't have a mouse mat?
B	uh
A	oh you don't mouse
B	I dunno
A	oh yeah they they you have to clean them don't you have to open them and uh get the ball out and like pull all the dust out
B	well I just
A	yeah
B	got rid of all that
A	is it uh quarter to seven already?
B	I know
A	thought it was earlier cos it's quite late actually
B	it is quite late
A	at eight eight or maybe nine no eight
B	no eight I think
A	yeah yeah
B	is it eight or just some? Yeah
A	think it's eight yeah
B	yeah it was probably better off coming for a drink first because like sometimes it just gets totally rammed
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	sometimes you if you go late you get um
B	yeah
A	totally empty but probably wouldn't happen  probably wouldn't happen  today though Thursday
B	no
A	uh
B	I think there's
A	yeah it was nice and you get the whole place to yourself you know
B	yeah
A	at this time you sort go round and uh
B	I used to like going shopping like
A	have they?
B	certainly in Sunderland like I remember
A	well I think it's a good idea
B	like shops are open at all like there's a few in Sunderland like a big Asda that's open all night
A	actually there was in Lancaster wasn't there?
B	was there?
A	yeah I think so yeah the Asda in Lancaster I think it was
B	ah yeah it was yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean
B	it was so peaceful
A	supermarkets that are crowded really really are quite annoying in fact well
B	oh it's horrible
A	yeah I mean I think sometimes you you you do sort of get a bit frustrated in in smaller shops when when they're full and you're like
B	oh
A	you can't sort of browse or you feel like you can't browse but but I know I like browsing so um
B	gets right on me nerves
A	um it's gonna
B	stop you yeah
B	yeah
A	it's um about couple of years since we've been in here
B	I know yeah
A	I dunno
B	is it still open? Oh yeah
A	and sitting there
B	oh that's right
A	then we sort of turned up here
B	oh yeah
A	and went you know
B	we came out like the um what's it called? The recreation ground there
A	yeah we we we totally surprised ourselves with like took a short cut
B	that's right
A	and
B	I'd like it if it was more ranch-like if it had more of a Texan theme
A	well part of it is orange
B	and there's some pictures of horses on the wall
A	there's the orangeness sort of
B	I'd like it if the barmen wore like cowboy hats and there was like straw on the floor
A	uh
B	D'you not think? D'you not think?
A	yeah I mean um
B	bit like a proper ranch
A	yeah um
B	with like lassos and like ironmonger and
A	dunno do do they have ironmongers in in ranches?
B	I don't know I was just thinking about like
A	yeah well
B	oh yeah
A	around the world
B	travelling
A	the one when he
B	yeah
A	uh when he went in Australia there was the one of like a big massive like
B	like a cattle ranch?
A	yeah it was just a big pub and it had like masses of uh tables and that you could just bring like
B	yeah
A	cattle going around
B	really? Oh that sounds good
A	uh I guess a bit like that
B	aha
A	and more like sort of
B	yeah
A	but um if it was in that out in the middle of nowhere then I don't know how people got back home after uh after they'd been drinking there perhaps they took the horses and the cattle cows
B	dunno
A	I guess you can ride a  ride a  cow
B	I dunno
A	no well or indeed anywhere uh
B	I don't think cows do
B	no don't suppose there is
A	uh I'm just guessing I
B	might maybe there is
A	oh
B	and shoot her
A	no no I'm
B	no you can
B	within the city yeah
A	within the city? No I didn't know about those
B	yeah
A	but um perhaps have been overwritten by like
B	yeah
A	Cos I guess our law is is based on precedents isn't it rather than
A	parts of it are not  are not  written down as laws but merely as precedents
B	I don't really know
A	as common law I mean like I've not
