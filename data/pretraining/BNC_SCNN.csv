A	right
B	right
A	okay
B	cool
B	I'm sorry
B	yep
C	won't come up
B	yeah
B	it just won't reach
A	you reach
B	uh
B	it's a little stiff
A	there's a knack to it obviously
B	yes
C	turn right
B	yep
C	no not that way
B	so not
A	I'm guessing
B	yeah but we go through
A	the sheep in that field were going very speedily
A	it's little legs were
C	right at the bottom
B	yep
A	mm?
B	oh
C	here
B	yep
A	should I  should I  just check mine?
B	well not now
A	yeah
B	right
A	er
B	yep
A	was there a little light on or something?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	yeah
B	which isn't dreadfully helpful
A	no
B	I think the thirty speed limit through this village is a bit optimistic
A	yes
B	it's ridiculous
A	yeah
B	in for no good reason
A	so yeah
B	yeah
B	if it didn't look quite stagnant I'd be very
A	I was gonna
B	keen on going for a swim
A	I was gonna say
B	oy oy oy
B	have fun walking down there at night
B	I suppose so
B	it's it sort of subsequently obtained
A	right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	hello
B	bit cleaner than us as well
B	the guys at work
A	yeah the valets
B	Valeters
A	Valeters
B	there we go
A	yeah
B	as in all I want is the inside vacuumed and the outside washed
A	yeah
B	in the space of half an hour
A	yeah
B	you know
A	fair enough
B	it's just we haven't been at home much to do it recently
A	no
B	but
A	I will hoover the car out tomorrow
B	yeah
A	yeah I will
B	to be honest it's now been so long I might do the outside
B	there's a nice sort of ah
A	hmm?
B	who have we got um next week?
B	I think that's fair
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	sort of admittedly I'm not seriously making progress but you know I'm sort of not been above fifty
A	no
B	but yet on other roads it's exactly the same speed limit despite the fact that they're multiple lanes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no er
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well let's guess what their main concern
B	is going to be
A	yeah
B	but again all of that's been there's
A	yeah
B	um
A	no
B	er driver error causes the accident
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	could be trusted to pick the appropriate speed for the set of circumstances
A	er you might need sort of signs saying warning this thing is coming up that you won't be able to see
B	well exactly
A	but
B	you would need sort of accepted guidance
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	but the optimum
A	and you're you're penalised for driving dangerously not for
B	breaking the limit
A	the speed
B	and that may well be the same thing
A	yes
B	but
A	that's what I mean
B	yes
A	like you said sometimes it's safer to
C	left
B	yep
A	mm
B	or indeed
B	he looked very happy didn't he
A	yeah
B	er indeed
A	nice
B	efficient little car
B	so light it's scary
A	so what?
B	so light it's scary
C	next on the right
B	just on the bend isn't it
C	yeah
B	yep
A	oh
B	to see it has to be said
A	farm there was selling boxes of eggs
B	I don't want a box
B	okay
A	I think we've probably still got some eggs in from er
B	oh at
A	oh
B	on the farm
A	I dunno if I ever had duck egg
B	I can't remember having it
A	um yeah
B	you think they'd be intrinsically very big?
A	yeah I'm I'm sure duck eggs are bigger
B	mm
A	so you could get a nice big fried egg
B	mm
A	Don't all there's a
B	however many people are about to beat you with sticks
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh no er
B	could've been
A	no no
B	oh alright
A	we were staying near near
B	no
C	right at the top
B	yep
B	they're really not making rapid progress
B	it is just a haze over there
A	yeah
B	specific meteorological conditions
A	yeah
B	what you can see
A	hmm?
B	what you can see
A	near
B	yeah
A	mm
B	at a guess
A	keep our eyes open
B	Holiday home
A	hmm
B	nice that you can just pop into a pub on a
B	it's quite nice that pub in Ely actually
A	yeah
B	just the experience of sort of going in on a Sunday
A	oh right
B	for full on
A	yeah
A	well we could do that tomorrow if you want for lunch
B	er
B	just have breakfast really
A	yeah
A	yes indeed
B	it's an awful lot more pleasant driving along here than on the A303
B	ooh
A	it's very
B	er
A	ff
B	you can't just
B	you can't just reverse
B	into a national speed limit A road
A	in the wrong direction
B	er
A	really bad
B	mm
A	it's weird how all these signs are all for er you know like on the for the wrong road if you like
B	in what
A	all the signs from that road you could see perfectly well on this road
B	quite steep
A	mm
B	the er three O three's been flattened out a bit
B	in comparison to er to be fair that's
B	mm
A	yes
B	chicken
A	one of us is gonna see another speedy sheep
B	horses
A	ah
B	real beginner's tour to farmyard England
B	we've seen some chickens and some pigs there
B	they seemed very nice pigs
A	they look nice
A	mm
A	very warm
B	actually
A	yeah
B	I don't think you'd look very good in leathers
A	you don't?
B	no
A	no
B	quite funny perhaps
B	mm
A	what that she's just dropped out of college?
B	yeah
A	you're sort of worried she's gonna go the same way that  just sort of drifted about
B	well
A	but he's actually got qualifications is the thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but the problem is I can kind of see it er from her perspective
A	yeah
A	well do you think she's sort of been testing and just gone oh I'll leave college and he's gone I
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	I can just imagine her sort of cos I imagine he's tried very seriously to tell her no look you need an education  you need an education  to
A	right
B	make your life easier
A	yeah
B	but I don't think that cos a lot of the stuff you can like a lot of the stuff he says as a father you
A	yes
A	that that's actually true
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean and I don't think she's a dreadfully easy daughter so
A	no
B	but I could
A	yes
B	she might well do
A	you know
B	mm
A	and she might think well actually if I  if I  can train in this area
B	mm
A	or you know do an apprenticeship
B	mm
B	this is a very long section at forty miles an hour
A	yeah
B	A village which grew up along the London Road
A	ah
B	interesting how things
A	right
B	stop from
A	ah yeah
A	yeah
A	oh
B	Excused
A	that's
B	? Wow
A	oh cool
B	grandpa
A	mm
B	er what did she say?
A	um she said it's it
B	yeah
A	for driving
B	um
A	okay
B	Cos although you know to fair it's not her fault
A	no no
B	I mean
A	yeah yeah
B	um
A	is is is
B	I mean just next time you should explain to her
A	yeah
B	go to
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
A	okay that's yeah
B	alright
A	okay
B	mm
A	then I'll just run past her what she needs to bring
B	mhm
A	to
B	yeah
A	right
B	I was just looking at one of the property websites
A	right
B	and it's
A	well not er just um sort of work
B	mm
A	mm
B	as in we can probably provide her with one but it might be
B	oh dear
B	that's a hilarious looking plate
A	R O presumably?
A	that must have been a present
B	yeah
B	I think it's really odd
A	mm
B	as in like
A	yeah
B	a sort of a kind of big bow on it
B	well lots of um sort of  sort of  recently teenage girls
A	mm
B	seem to
A	yeah yeah
B	presumably because teenage boys would just destroy it in a matter of days
B	um
A	yeah
B	on the other hand it means that he was quite likely to be killed in it
A	yes
B	um and mum's attitude for getting the Yaris was she was quite happy to dad just likes spending money
A	yeah
B	she likes spending money because it was buying nine airbags
A	yes
A	mm
B	I couldn't quite I still couldn't believe that they were getting me a car
A	yeah
B	sort of had a mental picture of sort of some shitty Ford Ka
A	yeah
B	or something along those lines
A	yeah
B	well er
B	so we'll be staying in this gear
B	for the remainder of this hill
A	nice
B	which seems to be continuing for quite a way
B	now after a brief flirtation with fourth
B	you've guessed it
B	it goes back into third
A	nice
B	it's a balance up this hill between carrying enough momentum to keep the car moving effectively but also not going too fast round the bends from a visibility perspective
A	yeah
B	I think a balance which has been won
A	mm
B	mm
A	really? Won't be hot for very long
B	well we caught the sun in Derbyshire
A	yeah but we were out all day
B	er
B	thank you Mr caravan
A	excellent
