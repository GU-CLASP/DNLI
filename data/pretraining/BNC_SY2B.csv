A	was your?
D	mm yeah
E	whose go is it?
D	eh not mine it's
C	I'm in the middle of my go
A	holding up holding up play
C	slightly
D	what happens if you put down a
A	come on
B	you get minus twenty-five points
E	so it's a game of risk really it's whether you want to play strategically or risk it
D	mm
B	however yeah but however as you saw in my last
E	what score are you on? eight
B	however there
E	you could probably play it strategically for a while
B	but on my last go you saw that I couldn't play anything so I had to shift as many high cards as possible
D	mm
E	I noticed that yeah
D	you don't want to get too cocky do you?
B	absolutely not oh mum are you out?
E	oh
D	is that a
E	mum's being a chicken she's not keeping hold of her cards
B	she's out
E	oh

B	minus twenty-five
D	right let's
A	check all you want it's correct
C	yes you won't catch her out
B	forty
C	mm
B	we should get counting your cards
D	well I'm in
E	you can't be more in trouble than I am
C	twenty-five thirty-five thirty-five forty-three fifty-two sixty-two seventy-seventy-seven what's a joker? thirty-two fourty fifty fifty-nine sixty-seven seventy-seven eighty-seven eight seven ninety-six ninety-nine hundred and two

B	oh huge scores
D	hundred and two hundred and a hundred and eight
E	you've caught us all there

D	yeah
E	over here please
C	hundred and two me
E	two jokers here darling you did very well to get those
B	mum had completely cheated us all
C	well why didn't you give me the nod then? if you were going out? then I could've put down
B	hey you're not allowed to cheated
A	cos you're my opponent
E	I
A	oh come on
B	give them a good shuffle
E	I will
A	I only have one joker
C	I think that
B	minus twenty-five what was your score before?
C	I think that was a bit naughty
A	erm oh
C	does your mum always win?
B	usually
E	yes
A	no it's not true
E	sometimes you do though
B	lucky in cards lucky in love
A	skill
C	bit of both
E	why?
C	eighty percent luck twenty percent strategy
A	I think a hundred percent luck
E	I think it's all strategy
A	ninety-nine percent luck one percent skill
E	I think it's strategy
C	it's tragedy or strategy?
E	strategy
C	mm yeah
A	well what strategy's involved in this game?
E	because you have to think it's quite mathematical you have to think what what's the risk? how many of the cards are left in the deck of the same that you're looking for
C	yeah yeah it's a bit
B	or probability of the cards coming up
E	exactly
C	I bet it's my brother
E	oh is that someone on the phone?
C	it's my brother I think
B	is that uncle
C	is it oh one one five?
B	yes
C	mm
B	should I answer it?
A	leave it or else we'll never play cards
C	right
B	poor uncle
A	well he'll go on for hours and we'll won't unless you want to stop playing cards
C	no
A	he's gone now anyway
B	he's gone now
A	I hope there wasn't a thunderstorm and he's hiding under the bed like normal
C	mm
C	can he hear?
A	I don't think he can hear
B	no
E	he can't hear in he's on a voice recorder
C	I don't know he's very grumpy
E	didn't you say something about him? erm oh no
C	he's very grumpy if erm well he's got my train set
E	yeah
C	yeah my brother took all the goodies took all the toys and everything
B	inherited
C	probably worth a worth a lot of money
D	come on
B	come on hurry up and deal you're so slow
E	I'm shuffling so that you know
B	such a slow coach
C	right let's go
A	it's a heavy sigh there
D	yeah I get frustrated at the erm the time shuffling
A	the slow play
D	yeah I'd rather get on with it cos I've I've lost points there so I just want to get on and regain some points
C	no no chance
A	it's it's quite good to have it
D	yeah well I like to just get on with it
B	but it's luck so even if you don't shuffle one might say that it's the same as shuffling luck of the cards
E	can you just count them? is that ten?
B	true isn't it depressing? six o'clock and it's pitch black
C	correct ten
B	have you
A	I've changed that clock yeah I've not changed all of them
A	I I didn't have the the erm clock change in my car
