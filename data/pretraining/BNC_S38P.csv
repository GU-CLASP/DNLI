C	was it?
B	yeah a lady died
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	mm it happened in
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	that's these lorry drivers I worry about they're driving about
A	yes
C	that far away from another lorry in front of them
B	oh god that's terrible isn't it? I know
A	yeah
C	why they do it
C	so that there's a lot of drag
B	the that's it they get in a slipstream
C	it's er
B	and they use it as
C	yeah
B	fuel but you've got to have a mate in front that you know
C	yeah
B	if you if you your
A	it's a stupid thing to do
B	it's daft
C	it's so illegal isn't it?
B	yeah and he knows not to brake all of a sudden
C	well and he can't help it if
A	no
C	something happen can he?
B	well well if
A	what if the car in front brakes suddenly?
B	I mean
A	that's it isn't it?
B	mm
C	well we all know not to brake all of a sudden
B	mm
C	that's not
A	yeah
C	that's not the issue is it?
C	that's
A	no
C	tailgating is the issue
B	yeah
C	which is really stupid
A	that's why they tell you
B	mm
A	you should
C	two chevrons they say
A	yeah
C	we always get into that one in er near
A	yes we do
C	keep two chevrons apart
B	mm well it's it's the same as when I'm driving you're a hundred metres
C	yeah
B	and always drive a hundred metres apart and that way it's nice and steady and you've got
C	it is
B	you do you do it it goes a bit
A	mm
B	like that anyway
C	yeah
B	the whole thing is a bit elastic before you
C	oh yeah yeah
B	if you've got a hundred vehicles in a convoy it'll all go a bit elastic
C	yeah
B	but erm that's safe and it's comfortable just to
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	but
C	but they
B	do you know what they did to get it right for my lads? cos I thought we're gonna get this spot on right so no one could ever say anything
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and when the truck in front
A	I see
B	in between those
A	yeah
B	two you're in the right
A	yeah right
C	that's great
B	you're a a hundred metres
A	that's a good idea
C	that's a great idea
B	we still we did it on the on the vehicle park er
A	yeah
B	put one vehicle at one end a hundred metres and sat in the vehicle and
A	yeah
B	it's now where is it?
A	right
B	we've put two little paint marks on the screen so there you go
A	that's great for letting you know isn't it?
B	you're a hundred metres
A	yeah
C	that's a great idea that is
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	they all have sensors now though don't they? they got sensors for everything else
A	it's coming very quickly isn't it?
C	yeah
A	now
C	but the trouble is if
A	yeah
C	you've got sensors and they're only going thirty miles an hour you
A	yeah but if it's a thirty mile limit
C	yeah well if that's a thirty mile limit
A	I mean
C	that's fine but if you're a long way and you're behind some silly old codger that's only doing about twenty
B	mm
C	that's against the law anyway
A	mm
C	too slow
A	yeah mm
B	mm mm
B	yeah I had one of those as well on the way back
C	you do get them don't you every now and then?
B	yeah yeah you do
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	but then if you've got patience that don't really
B	mind you all the roads where I really do think on the country roads it should be forty
A	yeah
C	it should shouldn't it?
B	it should be that should be the rule country roads
A	why do
B	forty
A	they have though?
C	why have they got well
B	well
A	they go up to sixty
C	up there
A	god you can't do it
C	this road they you you can do and people you know that big sharp corner down there?
B	mm
C	they come down there there's the youngsters especially
B	mm yeah
C	they come down there and think that they can get round that big old sharp corner
B	and they go off into the left
C	and they go off yeah you there's there's no end of problems
B	yeah
C	and the poor old farmer across who's who's right on the corner
B	mm mm mm
A	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah they're really silly
A	mm
C	you don't get many
A	well it they want
B	mm
C	you just
A	comfortable driving don't they? that's
C	yeah
A	what it's about
C	you don't want white-knuckle driving
A	really
C	do you?
B	no
A	no
B	but
C	no you haven't
B	there might be a combine
C	might be a horse
B	or a horse might be a bike
A	yeah
B	and you won't get past it
C	and no no
B	might be a tractor
B	doing the hedge
C	I think that road there coming past the
B	mm
C	I think that's the most dangerous road that is
B	well that is yeah people and they do hurtle along there you know
C	they do hurtle along there
A	mm
B	yeah and they push you along if you're doing forty they push you
C	yeah they do
B	I love doing that
A	what? sticking
B	I do
A	to forty?
C	annoying them
B	I do er I don't go I don't go over forty knowing it er in into erm
A	no
C	no well
B	cos you can't you can't see there's no point
A	yeah
C	well on the
B	erm
A	well
C	that start at forty outside
A	yeah there's quite a lot erm
B	mm
A	those speed limits
C	yeah and then then a
B	yeah
C	and then
B	keeps up and down
C	when you get down
B	and up and down
C	yeah
B	mm
C	but that's a bit of a nuisance if they're gonna be forty that should be forty all the way there
B	yeah yeah I think so I mean er
C	the
B	that one forty I hate it
C	it's terrible
B	I won't go on there well I well I I put my foot down and
A	do you still do the?
B	no I stopped it
A	oh
B	I couldn't put up with it at all
A	oh
B	and I I
C	no
B	she just goes non-stop
A	it's funny we but when you switch off and they say they suddenly say well what do you think? you erm
C	oh
A	er
C	yeah
B	well I'm not sure on that one
B	oh shocking
A	or that is right isn't it? mm mm
C	you're not sure?
C	I thought you believed in god
B	yeah well it depends what she's
B	what she's yeah
A	mm
B	like oh
A	oh
B	and they haven't got fresh water they spend a lot of money
A	oh
B	putting wells in for them
C	oh
A	yeah
B	you know and now they're going to see
A	mm
C	yeah
B	you know this is it if you're happy until
A	yeah
B	doing that then they go off
C	yeah
B	down completely the wrong road
A	mm
B	erm
C	but then I mean if if you think about missionaries and what have you in the eighteenth
B	mm
C	and nineteenth centuries
B	mm mm
C	they've got a lot to answer for they didn't I mean they they literally stopped the tribal way of life
B	mm no and
C	allowed them
B	that was all
C	whatever they want
B	yeah but but it's easy for us to say that now but at the time
C	it is cos the
B	they thought they were doing the right thing
C	did they? well
A	yeah
C	no they believed they were
B	didn't they? yeah
C	doing the right thing
B	well
C	they just want to
B	yeah
C	influence whatever religion they were teaching at the time
B	yeah
C	onto innocent people
B	yeah
A	but didn't you say
B	didn't
A	that lady you she has holidays in Peru and or
B	oh yeah
A	getting it paid for
B	she goes yeah oh she's been to China she goes all over
A	all over the place
B	all over the place I mean I'm a bit
A	yeah and you think
B	suspicious about it
A	mm
B	because she erm
B	well she's done this thing on her house where she you get equity out of it I know she does that
A	oh
C	oh yeah
B	which is bonkers anyway I think
A	yeah
B	you never get what you
A	mm
B	to Gambia when she goes and the last time I said are you sure are you sure
A	sounds like fun doesn't it?
B	are you sure you're happy about going? so there's the Gambia there's this thin strip then there's Senegal goes around it there's this tiny thin strip that just follows up by the side of the river
C	yeah
B	Gambia
A	yeah
B	and it's only become separate because the French used to get inland by using that river and they they took that little thin strip
C	that strip yeah
B	by the side you see erm but there's Senegal and then and erm she I said er er are you
C	oh yeah
B	you see
A	yeah
B	and she
C	yeah
B	Senegal didn't have it but the place next
C	yeah
B	did
A	mm
B	and there was only a few hundred kilometres across and there was a border crossing
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so you don't know do you? er erm and
A	yeah
B	all the rest is jungle it's not anyone could walk
C	well of course they could
A	mm
C	yeah and they do don't they?

C	to get there yeah
A	oh right
B	so
A	mm
B	and they had to hand them in when they left the school
A	oh
B	and that and they maintain the school maintain them
A	yeah
C	that's okay if they don't get a puncture on the way
B	so that and that was good
C	and then you've got to get off and push it all the way
B	shoes were fine they're fine but a computer?
C	yeah
B	bring them up to date I'm taking them a computer but they can't er she was gonna fix it but
A	yeah mm
B	and it's all got to go via mobile phone cos there's no you know it's the only way you can link it is by
A	oh right

A	uhu
B	there's a I think that's probably about two foot high I think or something like that and they're two foot high
C	yeah
A	right
B	but that's a board on a board yeah but there's a round tower coming out from half a round tower coming out with a
A	oh okay
A	uhu
B	and I'll only have one just one window in it
A	right
B	and I've got a giant bell that will so so that that's looking at it oh and er and a thermometer with the figures hundred one
C	yeah
B	a hundred and twenty thousand and then I'll mark it
A	right
B	all the way up so that we can put the red where we've got
A	uhu
B	erm and then I was gonna make it all about 3D but I thought you know I'd
C	yeah
B	erm and so looking down on it on on the top of it
A	right
B	there's the tower sticking out it'll be it'll be on a
A	uhu
B	yeah so that I so that the flat piece the timber at the front with blocks of wood there going up yeah?
A	right
B	and and then
B	so it'll hold you heat it up a little bit
C	yeah
B	and it'll
A	yeah
B	so er only got one one window I think and the bell will hang see by having a piece of timber coming up here I can make a a right angle have a shelf bracket or something to hang I've got
C	yeah are you?
B	and I've got a
B	and it's got and then that it's the
C	what and it's your bell?
B	oh it's bigger than that it's a lovely one it will sit in it will sit in there
A	oh right
B	it will sit in there alright
A	so this is
B	no the bell is that that big heavy one
A	oh
B	and that will sit just underneath the window so when they put the money in it'll go ding each time and I might have another a flap or something or a lever or a piece of string coming from the
A	mm
B	the bell bits down the side so if somebody puts money in er you know paper money pull the bell pull the cord a pull cord from the outside
C	oh I see
C	so long as their money don't get caught up in the pull cord
B	oh well that'll come sideways somewhere
C	but don't you think if if
A	yeah
C	if they're putting money in and they got to do it their self that's a bit that's a bit sort of
B	well you can't er how are you gonna work it with a?
A	well just
B	erm
C	they just put it in
B	just if the
C	it's supposed to be anonymous isn't it?
B	well it is yes yes yeah yeah
A	well yeah well
B	yeah but
C	if they
A	the coins will ring the bell
B	well the one I've got the coins will ring the bell but
A	so if they didn't put any
B	if you want to be quiet put a quiet one they can drop one in now so it'll all drop say you imagine this is the same shape at the bottom all the money would I I thought I'd put erm a biscuit tin that well would just fit that size
A	mm
B	a round one in the bottom
C	yeah
B	to collect it and I could do a flap here
A	oh
B	hinged with a lock
A	oh gosh
B	there so
A	yeah
C	if you er open it and pull the tin out and it's the money's in the bottom
C	yeah
A	oh yeah oh
B	and that'll work or I could have another flap anywhere but you've got to
A	mm
B	and shake it I think it may be better if I just put a flap here
C	and you've gotta
A	yeah
C	what about security? you're not even
B	ah well it's on this is on a it'll be on a plate on a on a board
C	yeah

C	right yeah
B	and and I'll tie it to the underneath of the table so if anyone picks it up and
A	right
B	so it it will be and actually throughout the day if we get a quiet bit we can
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	it would be it would be really embarrassing to take and also then this can sit in the church and er and I've done a
A	no
C	no
B	so I think I'll have a a big lump of something
A	so it's so it's on your table is it?
B	outside but when the church is open on this is something that we can use

A	yeah
B	but that's the thing about these
C	yeah you just yeah you
B	but also they are they they
C	yeah
B	so by doing having to do it twice I've just lost my work
A	yeah
B	my designing
C	yeah

A	oh I see
B	I haven't I'm not down
A	yeah
B	on anything
A	right
B	so

A	mm
B	she was quite excited about this one we might still play
C	well
B	oh well
A	right
B	round on the teapot instead of erm when I've got the dashes in I've just put the dashes from a er er of the same font
C	yeah
B	sat them on the circle and the there was well honestly two one they went right over the top of each other
C	oh right
B	and I thought wow it's worked you see
C	yeah
B	but then instead of on my new programme the first thing down on the list is of erm actions or what what you wanna do or something
C	yeah
B	the first one on my new programme is combined the on my old one is group
C	oh right
B	so instead of grouping it I ended up combining it and it takes a bit of one away from the other doesn't it?
C	yeah yeah
B	and that's what I did so she got a completely white little bit where she wants a light grey bit
A	right
B	erm they didn't get all their money back erm but they they paid two hundred and
C	yeah
A	mm
B	er at
C	yeah
B	and that's worth doing so next
A	right
B	so they're coming back next year we'll get it right
A	yeah
B	but she said I I'm not comfortable with you spending out again and we wasted one banner
A	mm
B	we that's fine if you'd like to give us a little discount then that's fine but we we will be happy with what we've got so I we can just
A	right
B	so that'll save me well I've got I would have to pay out for another one
A	right
C	mm
B	cos I got I've got it I made a mistake I got it wrong
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	but there's this
C	that look like organised chaos
B	that's the final stuff I had to do for the show banners and signs and everything and that's on at
A	yeah
B	all the little bits that
C	yeah
B	come up you know? erm do not remove the straw two of those three of
C	yeah?

C	oh yeah I know
B	I don't know what the farmers use them for
A	right
B	he worked out put one on top of the other
A	oh
B	and now you've visited the animals wash your hands sort of thing
A	yeah
B	wrapped right round oh no that was underneath he'd made made basins out of cutting
C	yeah
B	that black stuff
C	yeah
B	chopped it in half put an ends on
C	that's it yeah
A	oh
B	er so there were little where the water water ran into
A	right
B	so you you pushed a button water ran out and you rinsed that that there was er gel and and soap all round and then the waste
A	oh
B	er it it just then funnelled into
C	into the
B	into the bottom one
A	oh right
B	and he just took it and emptied it
C	yeah?
B	and that's now sat in the barn waiting for next year all made from rubbish
C	yeah
B	and of
A	right
B	all bits he wasn't gonna use he got like bought the banners so
A	oh
B	how much well the show catalogue signs
B	all this all all
