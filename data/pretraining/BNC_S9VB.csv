B	he maybe just wanted to check that he had it correct and
A	and then and then he kept saying say it again like after I'd said like two numbers and then he was like oh I thought there was a one and I like 0 seven it starts with 0 seven
B	are you sure you said it right in
A	of course I did
B	is that what you said back to him?
A	no but that's what I was thinking
B	why didn't you just look at your phone when he was on the phone?
A	because it doesn't come
B	oh yeah
A	but on yours it didn't
B	you could've just put mine on loudspeaker and looked at the number it would've been on the screen
A	yeah but he's he was using his credit and I could tell that he was like he was like what?
B	oh
A	what is it? cos I called you on my phone out of the packet and he was like what is it? tell me so I was like I'll call you back
B	oh
A	no no because then I rang him back
B	oh right oh yeah
A	cos I was like I can't I don't know what this number is so I was like I'll ring you back
B	yeah he was probably having a three way conversation
B	then they've said the wrong one so then he's asking you then well was it this
B	no no the woman she just the second one she knows what she's doing
A	yeah
B	she's an administrator not a receptionist so the woman
A	yeah
B	she just said erm she explained and
A	oh right
B	then it said oh I'll have your passport as well just as an extra and that was it she said right she didn't even say don't worry no never mentioned it
A	anything about money
B	no
A	otherwise yeah otherwise she would have said like oh we need this they like there's going to be a payment or whatever but
B	yeah there was no mention of I need this cos you have to pay
A	yeah
B	cos you just wouldn't say that you'd just say have you got it? if you're saying no I've got nothing
A	yeah
B	say well if you can't get that you'll have to pay
A	yeah
B	whereas this receptionist saying oh this is very expensive this thing you know? we can't just do it for anyone and if we did that everyone's going to be coming over
A	yeah because they right they got that
B	well in the letter it's not clear as well
A	erm
B	cos it doesn't say if you're a visitor and you're in the EU it says if you're not a resident
A	yeah
B	and you can't prove you're a resident you might have to pay
A	yeah
B	so that's not very helpful either
A	no
B	it's only when I started thinking well
A	yeah because cos grandma and grandad were going to buy something but they're not now because they're waiting to see if they have to pay anything
B	right
A	I don't know what it was they wanted to buy but they were going to buy something but now they're like no no cos we might have to pay
B	well you know? I wouldn't stop them buying it cos if there is a bill they they're not going to be able to pay it I think it's going to be I think it would cost a lot of money that
A	yeah
B	for
A	yeah
B	and they don't very expensive to have anything kind of surgery I know it's not surgery but it's classed surgical
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	do it but he wouldn't have to pay cos
A	no
B	cos he didn't say anything and he has the card you know? there's health restrictions on that card the reason they have it is because then they can contact the the right country and the right department that deals with
A	yeah
B	their citizens and they could claim that money back that they need to claim can't they?
A	yeah
B	I mean they may not even do it that way they might do it say at the end of the year and get a feel for
A	yeah like this many people
B	they may have done so many English people
A	yeah
B	and that'll that'll kind of counter out so much of the bill won't it?
A	yeah
B	well I would imagine there'd be probably more over here than English over there but
A	yeah
B	plus I
A	yeah
B	it's a bit unfair if they even have to pay the whole English price for it
A	yeah
B	just shows you if you're going to a non EU country it's worse
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't think they'd ever do that in this country they'd always treat you if you're really ill
A	yeah
B	they will make sure you're you know? you're treated
A	oh yeah what it is is that erm I think if you have a bill of over a thousand pounds there they won't let you back into their country
B	oh it said that on the letter
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but you probably wouldn't be able to come again until you paid it
B	I mean cos doctors they wouldn't refuse they take a an oath in this country don't they?
A	yeah yeah
B	to treat anyone that needs medical assistance
A	to like erm do anything possible to like save the most lives
B	yeah
A	but yeah like you were saying in America the ambulance won't come for you if you've not got health insurance
B	yeah it's hard to imagine anyone who's involved in the medical profession not helping somebody who needs
A	yeah well they like they would but then if like they help them then like who's going to pay for that?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the doctor doesn't say well yeah I'm a doctor but I'm not treating him until after he gives me some cash
B	they pay they treat people don't they?
A	yeah
B	they try to erm do what they can for them obviously if it's not urgent then they they probably won't they'd say well go and see a doctor
A	yeah if it's like ah I've had this ache in my eye
B	yeah I imagine any anywhere you would think in the world that if somebody was there was an emergency then they would treat them wouldn't you?
A	yeah but if like say if you were like on a plane though and someone was choking like they would help them
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	we're not far off now
A	mm
B	not too bad is it?
A	yeah
B	or he could be spending two hours to get to get over on public transport
A	he wouldn't use public transport do you know what he did though right? cos he went to
B	yeah
B	I was going to say he didn't get a taxi to
A	no and no buses were coming
B	yeah
A	erm they were all going to
B	did he walk?
A	yeah walked it took him an hour and he walked
B	yeah it's it's only a few miles isn't it? it's not very far so
B	well yeah
A	it's because there's not a straight bus going to
B	oh really?
A	yeah you have to change
B	well he
A	well like he kept looking to see the other bus that come past him but it didn't
B	mm
A	yeah but erm I don't know because
B	yeah well yeah
A	he said he knows
B	yeah
A	he was just looking in everywhere yeah
B	could've just went to the library
A	which one?
B	well there's one in
A	is there? maybe he's he
B	just you would've thought there'd be one don't know if there's one in
A	well because I I asked at the post office cos I asked the post office and I said do you know where I could find somewhere to photocopy?
B	oh right
A	and she was like oh there's not really anywhere that does it now there might be a computer shop in
B	oh right yeah
A	and I was like I said that to him but he didn't want to cos he thought if he goes to
B	he could've
A	then there's not
A	well it's the same thing
B	it's completely different one has a D on the end and the other doesn't
B	and there's a big difference in the places
B	one's a big
A	so cos it was
B	mm
A	yeah they've got in
B	yeah used to see them in most ah newsagents they must have stopped doing it they mustn't be doing so good
A	people mustn't need it really
B	yeah it's not a thing thing people need very commonly is it?
A	no
B	no
A	yeah I mean you've not even got a printer
B	erm no
A	yeah yeah I suppose it might be quite dear for you to run a printer and if you're like never really
B	yeah well no the only reason I'd get it is oh I want to start doing photos on it and printing them off and
A	oh you'd get a photographic printer or photographic paper
B	yeah that's the only one I'd get but yeah the that for a normal one it's not worth it I may as well just go to the erm library on the occasion I need it
A	mm
B	I want to be in the left lane I think
A	where is this?
B	this is
A	is it?
B	don't you know
A	no
B	you've been to
A	I know of course I have but I don't recognise it
B	this is a new development all this is quite
A	oh
B	and they have a cinema and restaurants and
A	mm
B	so you wouldn't recognise this bit this is all new
A	yeah but like I don't even recognise
B	I would've thought maybe
A	I I recognise the bowling thing but other than that
B	yeah it looks erm a bit of a mess
A	oh right yeah
B	so it will improve in the next few years
A	so why is it called
B	no it's it's not
A	mm
B	so that's where this is
A	oh right
B	if you go straight up that road it will lead straight to
A	cos I was saying to grandad and he was like even after cos I was like no erm it's in
B	that's what he said to me coming here
A	yeah
B	and I said no cos I had the thing here that said oh it's
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's
A	yeah
B	cos we're going to be in the wrong place
A	yeah
B	but it did it said cos I looked it up as well on the on online
A	yeah
B	and it's
A	I
B	really?
A	and he was like yeah and he was like looking at it and he was like yeah see it is
B	but did you then look at what he was reading?
A	no I
B	oh okay
A	cos he he had it and I was like oh right I was like
B	unless that was directions from somewhere cos there is a
A	yeah and he's like oh it doesn't matter cos if you put it in the sat nav it'll take you there and I was like yeah but but it would be good to know if you're going to
B	yeah cos that's what your mam said at first said it's
A	cos that's what grandad came home saying
B	oh right but he even said it today
A	no one no one no one yeah I know and then after cos you'd looked at it and said
B	and then he gave me and I said it's
A	yeah
B	so
A	but erm yeah like I even after you told us it was
A	but you know before you'd looked at it we'd not looked at it and he just came home saying
B	oh right right
A	and then he's still saying
B	and then when we got on this road
A	yeah
B	there's a sign saying
A	yeah
B	and he said see
B	yeah I just
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	gave up at that point
A	sometimes you have to yeah they're a bit like that
B	well here's a sign you can see it see the sign
A	yeah
B	so he must be thinking I was right it was
A	yeah yeah
B	there's a sign we're going to
A	I know yeah sometimes like I'm talking to them like either one of them and then they say things and I'm just like okay yes now next bit I'm
B	yeah
A	I know I took mine off I was sensible
B	that's dangerous behaviour that is surprised at you
A	yeah
B	it takes a millisecond you don't know what was going on behind you do you?
B	some idiot all of a sudden before you know it he's in the back of you and then you'll be through the front window
A	yeah although no cos the airbags are coming
B	oh right
A	but yeah I would it I would anyway if I had my seatbelt on but yeah generally it's a good idea to wear a seatbelt
B	you know I'm surprised listening to you defending taking it off
A	I mean it's not the worst thing but like I I'm sure there was one person who got like strangled by their seatbelt
B	it might have been a child and they weren't wearing a seat
A	yeah
B	I think we're here now
A	although on children in general it can be quite dangerous to have a seatbelt cos it can
B	yeah but it's not as dangerous as not having one
A	yeah
B	you'd rather have crushed ribs can you imagine the damage of going through that windscreen? you'd be travelling at the same time as like the same speed as the car when you hit it
A	yeah
B	so the car stops and if the belt doesn't stop you you're doing the same speed as the car
A	yeah
B	you know what? I think I should've turned right back there
A	you know you know like if there's airbags can you go through the windscreen?
B	not if they if they work
A	yeah if they yeah yeah but I suppose like you would be bashed like back and forth wouldn't you? cos if you didn't have your seatbelt so
B	oh you mean if you didn't have it would the airbags work?
A	yeah
B	well well you know your momentum could possibly because you're going along at a bigger speed
A	go through the yeah
B	they're they're designed really to have it on with a
A	yeah
B	seatbelt on so you you might end up you could possibly end up bursting the
A	do they have flour in them?
B	no there is kind of a powder
A	yeah
B	it's probably an explosive powder isn't it?
A	oh right great
B	well that's cos they
A	ah did you know flour is explosive?
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	like what when you mix it with something?
A	no when you throw it in the air like if you yeah if you I'm not sure what it is exactly but if you throw it in the air like if you burst a bag of flour
B	oh no it is still further up I thought I should have turned further back I recognise this inn we're nearly there now if you do what?
A	if you if you burst a bag of flour and it's all in the air and there's like a a flame it'll all explode
B	oh right if you if you have a very high flame on you?
A	there'll be an explosion not a high one you could
B	oh right
A	like you could do it with the stove on probably
B	oh right
A	if it was close enough
B	yeah that all like it's it means it's combustible is it?
A	well highly combustible
B	oh right
A	it is quite a
B	there it is do you want to phone your grandad? tell him we're at the entrance then?
A	yeah
B	erm ask him
A	I don't know what entrance it is though oh I'll just say we're at the yeah I'll know what I'll say yeah
A	okay
