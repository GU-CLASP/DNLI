A	he's been in so much pain
C	what was up with him?
B	I don't
A	he had cancer
B	what it was it was it was some kind of cancer but it was
A	cancer for ages he went to die in like
A	yeah he went to die in like
C	aye
A	really?
B	I just find that
C	so now like it's kind of like coming to an end and there's no more drugs
A	nothing else
B	I know that this is really awful but I find it really cruel
A	yeah it's really cruel
C	well that's the stage that that she's at yeah
B	if you're if you're gonna be in pain and miserable and like it it's not it's an existence really it's not life is it?
C	that's it yeah
A	yeah
B	that's what happened with my erm my nan cos she got
C	mm
B	but straightaway like she made her decision she was like I don't want any medicine like this is it
C	yeah
B	I'm just gonna let it happen naturally and literally in about five days she did die
A	yeah
B	but on her terms
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and the way she wanted to
B	and like that's all you can wish for someone really isn't it? that
A	yeah
C	mm mm
B	I mean it's really sad don't get me wrong but
A	make her do it
B	make her do it
A	yeah
C	yeah that's the thing
B	mm
A	yeah
C	than like so like the bit cos normally when you get MND you get diagnosed and then like within a year you're like you can't move you can't speak and then eventually it's your lungs that don't work any more so that's how you die
A	yeah
C	and that part's gonna take so much longer for her it's just kind of like ah
A	has she not said to people that she wants to be taken somewhere and just euthanised?
C	she's got two kids both under the age of ten do you know what I mean? so
B	that's so awful
C	and I mean they don't know what's wrong
B	nature can be so cruel sometimes can't it?
C	I know so she's kind of cottoning on cos they've got the stairlift put in and stuff and she's kind of like
A	yeah
C	but she's not telling them which I kind of think's wise but at the same time I'm like
A	yeah she's going to
B	yeah
A	need them to
B	you can't protect your kids from that kind of stuff forever
C	like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I love your teeth so much
C	mm?
A	you got such nice teeth
B	yeah
C	you know what? I was looking the other day and I really really like my top teeth but I think I should of had a brace on my bottom ones looking them cos like
A	yeah it's just your front four though innit?
C	yeah innit?
B	but you never see bottom teeth though
C	yeah but like that's the thing when I smile you can't see them but like I'm kind of thinking like god when I've got some money I might just go private and get like an invisible brace put on
A	yeah that's what I'm was getting done
B	that's what I've got
C	the bottom ones
B	I had erm
C	mm
A	yeah you can hardly see it though
B	on the back I never had a train tracks on the bottom
C	ah really?
B	er next year some time yeah
A	oh they're taking it out?
B	yeah
A	it's not permanent?
B	no
A	I thought it were permanent
C	see that's the type of thing that I want on the bottom cos like even like cos I've just got too many teeth for my mouth that's basically
A	yeah I've got two I've got extra teeth yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah my top ones are pretty much perfect except for overlap there
C	yeah
A	and the bottom ones are all
C	oh yeah
A	and that's basically cos I got I've got an extra tooth there and an extra tooth there like can you see where they're sticking out?
C	yeah
A	got extra
C	you've had loads of problems with your
A	oh fucking
B	mm
A	I'm still having problems they took them two out my chin here is numb but when I
C	yeah
A	I get a shooting pain through my front teeth it's horrible
C	oh
B	when are you getting the other side done?
A	sixth of November
C	oh
B	okay
A	like
C	that's just something you've got to be really careful of cos you might could get an overbite from it
A	I've got an overbite anyway
C	you don't have an overbite
A	I do
C	you don't cos those teeth go in front of those ones
A	oh do you mean an underbite?
C	underbite sorry that's what I meant sorry
A	yeah I've got an overbite
B	no overbites are like pretty natural do you know what I mean? like
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	I mean I've had braces like I had a massive overbite I could fit my finger in it before and I've got a little one now
C	I've got a little one
A	yeah
B	but you can't fix that like these teeth in are in line there
A	no they'll fit they they said to him when he fits a brace it'll fix it
B	mm
A	cos it'll move my jaw
C	yeah
A	but I've gotta have my wisdom teeth taken out first and then I've got to have these extra teeth taken out before I put a brace on
D	hi
