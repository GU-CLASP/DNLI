B	cool I'm getting
A	I
B	cool I think Phantom's coming
A	if you want we can try and
B	er it's probably worth doing yeah I'll let you do that and I'll just chill a bit here
A	you'll let me try and take the Wraith?
A	you need two people to do it
B	nah I have faith
A	no honestly
A	you need two people to do it you'll
B	nah
A	do you want me to go for the Wraith now?
B	yeah screw it
A	so you need someone to board it and you just have to punch the er thing off and then whilst they're grabbed hold it
B	yeah you you hitch on yeah
A	you you yeah yeah hitch on there
unknown_female	holy moly
A	me censoring myself is weird
A	oh here's the Wraith
B	yeah there it is
unknown_female	just gotta wait for it to
B	ow
A	oh
B	two
A	well that's great
B	two shots it just KO'd me in mid-air
A	I was busy looking up at the sky
B	killed by Grunts how do you feel?
A	I know
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	is one of them a fuel rod gun?
B	dunno
A	there's a grenade down there I might've just killed you

A	let's try that again
A	I just wanna lob
unknown_female	wanna get them all
B	oh dead
A	you died? already?
B	yeah
A	you can run over here and you can spawn
B	hooray
A	alright now you just seem to have run off now
A	that invisible wall though the Wraith I can't wait to get
B	oh
A	a Wraith dropped on me I think we might need to kill a few more of them before the rain stops
B	yeah probably
A	my distraction didn't work
A	I feel the need to keep talking
A	the long silences I'm like well this is just worthless
A	you're trying to concentrate aren't you?
A	yeah we need to kind of keep this going I died again
B	or you end up just talking but you talk absolute rubbish
A	yeah you just talk nonsense don't you?
B	you don't even realise what you're talking about when you
A	yeah if we actually do like
B	yeah
A	right now a Wraith maybe
A	yeah I know I don't I don't like this level it's
A	it's it's really really difficult and there's not much that happens in the way of story except you get
B	oh I'm dead
A	given Cortana oh you should be able to spawn yeah there you go
B	cool
A	let's have a look for the Wraiths
B	boing boing
A	is it there?
B	oh
A	get the mortar
B	oh is Victor around there?
A	er
A	I think he
B	okay
B	er
A	interrupt the guy?
B	whatever
A	is it open?
B	yeah he
B	there we go
A	do you want me to
B	yeah you can do
A	there's a Banshee there
B	it's what I'm best at
A	do you reckon you could get that Banshee?
B	nope I'm gonna distract
A	distract what?
B	well the enemy
A	don't go and die cos
B	so they don't don't shoot you
unknown_female	oh well done
A	did you?
B	yeah
unknown_female	ah
A	I'm EMP'd so good effort
A	oh my god I've er I've got hit by a Banshee shell so I'm already dead
A	oh my god I'm getting boarded
B	oh shit
A	right I blew it up but I got I got boarded I killed
B	right
A	the guy
B	ah oh
A	do we get the tank again? let's see
A	okay
B	is er is that where we are?
A	do you wanna come over here just so you're a little bit
B	yeah
A	closer to the phone?
A	no no like come and sit over here just so you're a bit closer to the phone
B	yeah yeah being a bit quiet over there am I? ah I don't sit over here normally do I?
A	is it weird?
B	the view's weird
A	the viewing angle
B	the colours look so vibrant from over here
A	gotta save that
B	yeah
A	oh there's something there
B	yeah it's the Banshees
unknown_female	is it?
A	do you wanna maybe try and EMP him? oh that was close wasn't it?
unknown_female	try and shoot him down
A	mate I told you I'm good at it though
A	oh it's
B	oh
A	if you've got double
A	I'm trying to actually make use of the mortar tank as a mortar tank but I need I need a spotter really
B	yeah
A	to try and tell me where where stuff's landing
B	mm
A	or we just keep firing until some numbers flash up on the screen
A	where are they?
B	that's bad
A	where are they?
B	er there's some Jackals coming up here
A	it's alright there's still more
B	yeah
A	I'm just taking in obviously
B	shall I just go
A	no
A	er well I wouldn't if I knew you were shooting at me it'd help if we had sound but we
B	yeah
A	can't
B	it is quite hard
A	you can you turn back the
B	yeah that's what I'm that's what I did with that one anyway
A	we'll just go to checkpoint which is good to be having a Wraith
A	in decent condition
A	I think this is where the Banshees
B	is there an ammo drop at the top?
A	er possibly?
B	oh
A	there we go
B	and health kits that's good
A	shotguns are useless on
B	yeah
B	I know
A	oh I died I think the Wraith's fine though which is a little bit worrying
B	oh
A	we might need to go back and get the Wraith
A	oh
B	no
A	oh wow there's a party down there and we're not invited
A	it's alright
A	we might get the Wraith back now I'm not gonna do what I did again I'm gonna wait for them to come to me
B	yeah
A	oh
B	that that sucks
A	probably try and how do I stealth get in a Wraith?
A	oh I can't go that way the Ghosts are messing me up too much
B	oh god I think I've already got snipers on me
A	yeah I think you did as well
B	just er
A	er grenades are happy-time
B	yeah
A	I died again
B	oh I almost did and oh
A	if you die in quick succession when we start a checkpoint it'll put us back to the other one
B	oh er
A	did you not know that?
B	no
A	oh you don't do much on Legendary though do you?
B	no
A	I dunno if they
B	oh it was Jun that almost sniped me
A	oh was it? I was gonna say where the heck was er oh are you dead?
B	sometimes you get the heretic ones don't you? but
B	but yeah Jun has team killed me a lot in the past
A	I know right I'm gonna run round this way
A	yes
B	oh
A	two of me I just
B	yeah
A	fell off the map
B	problem is they sometimes shoot through the hologram at me
A	I fell off the map though
B	oh
unknown_female	I'm back
unknown_female	hi guys
B	I'm just gonna throw random grenades out
A	I'm gonna get the Brute shot just cos it it does wonders to their shield
B	yeah
A	does a Brute shot do increased Melee damage cos it has the blade on the front?
B	er
A	it doesn't does it?
B	I don't think so there isn't a Brute shot in this anyway it's a Concussion gun
A	not that I no no no there's the erm
B	oh the Spiker?
A	the Spiker that's what I meant
B	oh right yeah
A	yeah sorry my bad
A	oh grenade launchers that'll do
B	oh what?
A	it's so strange without sound
A	er that'd be quite an interesting like game type thing you know for custom games if you could erm
B	yeah
A	reduce like the players' like sounds so they had to play with like
B	oh yeah
A	no sound and then you could do like a hide and seek type thing couldn't you?
B	yeah it'd be kinda cool actually
A	I think that'd be kind of cool
B	I am getting that grenade launcher I love grenade launchers
A	I'm gonna try and get the Wraith if it's still down here I'm being shot at cos I can see the bullets I can't hear the bullets
B	I used to be like a deadeye with a er grenade launcher
D	hello
B	oh I'm dead
D	what are you playing?
A	Halo
D	oh mm
A	is that alright? cos
D	yeah why?
A	yeah
B	right I'm over on back I'll try and take on some of these turrets
A	we're trying to like keep talking through all of this so
D	I wouldn't worry too much
B	well I think the idea is you just do what you normally do
D	yeah yeah
unknown_female	I guess well we were just saying that like you'd er end up like rambling on and stuff
B	I'm dead again
A	I was really close to you
A	yeah that times that cowbell yeah times three accelerations?
A	not worth it I'm gonna
A	kill you again here
A	no you didn't die damn it I did
B	I
A	like mad tactical ducking
B	I totally heard
D	oh
A	how do you not die then?
A	well I've never done it
B	oh
A	how is it? oh for god's sake I got the kill though
B	yeah
unknown_female	it's not gonna give me to the checkpoint yes it is
B	oh nice
A	how did that not kill you? do you wanna get in the turret?
B	just gave me a little nudge er I don't think it would do much but why not?
A	yeah
B	want to reset
A	how come your? oh I control the vibration turned off from my I'm assuming my
A	like entire game thing
unknown_female	the problem is cos the thing's not on the front of it I'm just getting shot I'm probably gonna die
A	suicide
B	suicide mission in
A	how is this Ghost not dead? there we go
B	I'm trying to shoot it off the back but it's not working very well
A	oh balls
B	just er taking out some of the Jackals round you try and help you
A	the Jackals are actually what are doing like a lot of the damage to be honest
B	yeah
A	trying
B	oh
A	oh there's a Ghost down here
B	oh cool means I can go quickly between the turrets and die
A	yeah
B	whereabouts is it?
A	er back where I came from
B	down there towards the
A	down this way
B	oh right cool
A	you see where my
B	yeah
A	down there
B	got it
A	do you reckon I can get the Banshee again?
A	probably
B	no it's not it's the Banshee
unknown_female	nice
A	mm
B	checkpoint as well sorted
A	I can't tell where that's landing
A	come on
B	can you
A	I don't think so no I am not
B	does he come with the Scorpion sometimes?
A	oh being shot from behind
unknown_female	look at the Ghost oh
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	well we get them
A	yeah
B	god they take
A	yeah they do
B	yeah just
A	splat and kill
B	there is a Phantom
A	yeah
B	over here
A	that's what killed me
A	there's a Ghost that comes out there as well so just
B	yeah I'll I'll try and ram down the bridge when they're
A	yeah
B	right that's some Jackal multi kills I didn't get the Elites
A	I died
B	oh Brute oh
A	oh right
A	oh god I didn't realise you'd died you were like that's some kills and I'm like
A	cool good work
B	well I told you I was going on a
A	yeah but I'm in a Wraith that's
A	prone to like
B	ram that was that was gonna be suicidal legendary
A	I just got boarded
B	right I got the Brutes that time
A	oh very nice
B	or one of them almost got the Ghost he's gonna kill me though
A	yeah I know we're gonna yeah there we go right I'm not gonna send
A	the Wraith down there cos the Wraith actually gets messed up by the er the Phantom marks the Concussion charge
unknown_female	right yeah
A	it really limits
B	yeah
A	I dunno why I said limits really weirdly then
A	really limits your ability to er drive forward
A	cos it's not like you've got wheels or anything cos
A	I might actually go and er try and shoot them there cos it's a little bit closer to home
A	that hit something
A	my god
B	well I'm sure you probably take out the Brutes
A	oh I'm being shot at from behind what is shooting at me?
B	right I think that's the last one over there
A	I died from a Banshee
B	right I'll try and spawn
A	can you er? oh for fuck's sake right yeah we'll just do it on foot it'll be easier I think my shields have immediately run down
B	I do not like let
B	I can't hear your death noise without the sounds
A	yeah I know I
B	okay if you if you wanna focus that bridge then I'll go on a suicide ram down towards the other Phantom
A	yeah just the er the Banshee shoots me
B	oh okay
A	well the Banshee's not down that straight
B	yeah but I'm still doing a suicide ram down this straight cos
A	okay
A	oh I got shot out the Wraith and the Wraith's still alive
B	oh I'll try and spawn you first
A	you might want to erm you might wanna kill yourself to be honest
B	right suicide ram?
A	just
A	right erm I dunno what to use the Wraith for then cos the Wraith's just pretty useless now that it's on fire
A	suicide ram we can't both suicide ram
A	cos then we'll just have
B	yeah
A	on the same checkpoint
A	I'm trying I
A	I'm I'm being shot at by quite a lot of stuff to be honest
A	I'm dead
B	I'm gonna shoot off the top then
A	but we've done alright there so if you wanna spawn
B	yeah
A	me we can try and get a checkpoint I might grab a grenade launcher just to er
B	yeah there there it is
A	keep hold of it
A	oh there's none left never mind erm
B	er there's one round here somewhere where
A	yeah I know I dropped one on the floor like over here there's a
B	I got killed by a really well placed grenade when I was back here
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	that
B	oh great
A	I could've used the Wraith for that
B	right I'm going on a suicide ram turn that turret back on
A	what the heck shot me then? I don't actually know what it was that killed me
B	no
A	some Hunters oh my god the Hunters
B	it's shall shall we try try and lure them in? oh they're just gonna walk up to the top aren't they?
A	yeah
B	except they can't go into a turret
A	I just assassinated an Elite and then I got killed by a Hunter
A	by assassinating the Elite
B	yeah
A	oh we're being Concussion shelled by something
B	yeah that's not fun
A	can I assassinate the Hunter? no
B	right I think I might blow its
A	mm
B	right
A	oh it's dropped Elites as well
B	oh
A	oh and they got a Hunter shelled in the face
B	erm
A	thank you very nice of you
B	I'm sorry I think that was my grenade
A	no
A	oh right good good top well done
B	yeah
A	oh
B	oh come on spawn spawn me
B	there are Needles slowly
B	taking my health down
A	just restore your health
B	yeah
A	there you go
A	no there we go
unknown_female	is that an Engineer down there?
B	right Engineer's down
A	oh right cool that'll make it a bit easier I'm dead again by the way
B	oh
B	it's okay we can go inside now just stay away
A	oh my god Emile
B	did you just punch him to death?
A	no Emile punched him to death
B	oh god
A	I know we look very similar
B	yeah
A	I'm going for that
A	oh that'd have come in handy
A	here we go
B	the amount of times you've played this you should've realised that
A	I
B	oh right
A	just cos it's such a pain
B	yeah
A	I'd love to know what's happening in the cut scene
B	erm there was some
A	oh have you seen the Halo room? oh yeah that's
B	oh yeah that's
A	I've been in it it's quite cool
A	you go to like er different erm like computers and they tell you like different things I dunno what they say
B	yeah
A	I can't remember but you you press X and there's a prompt that comes up and
B	that's pretty cool
A	yeah
B	there's all references to red versus blue or something as well isn't there?
A	yeah there is yeah
B	yeah
A	you can't tell when anyone else is speaking cos they're all wearing helmets
B	yeah well his head's moving slightly he's
B	he's
A	but Emile's is moving they're all moving
A	little bit
B	but Emile he almost never talks so
A	mm
A	his death in this is pretty good as well to be honest
B	yeah
unknown_female	I'm ready how about you?
A	and then stabs it in the face
A	do you not remember?
B	yeah I do yeah
A	yeah
A	Jun just nothing happens to Jun he's
B	yeah
A	er he just he er
B	oh there's theories that he er escaped on the Pillar of Autumn isn't there?
A	mm
B	what do you mean?
A	cos erm
B	yeah
A	erm and then
B	yeah yeah you do the rest of the mission with Emile but
A	Jun?
B	and Jun
A	Jun?
B	isn't there
A	he just disappears doesn't he at some point?
A	oh this is what it's like she shows you
A	have you not seen that
B	oh I think I might've done actually
A	it's er just like some cut scenes with this and she says to erm
unknown_female	yeah
A	after
B	yeah
A	exploded
B	yeah
A	so I'm assuming this is where Jun disappears
B	oh yeah he stays with Halsey
A	coward
B	just realised my chicken nuggets
A	chicken nuggets
B	are still in the oven
A	we're good
unknown_female	alright
D	oh I remember
D	hello
A	how do?
D	why? how? why hasn't it saved it?
A	well it don't matter it it doesn't matter but
D	oh
D	why?
A	yeah we just entered a campaign on Legendary
D	oh
A	but on
D	yeah
A	on the previous mission it disappears
A	and now we're on that one
D	oh that's weird why's it done that?
A	er cos we stopped here and then we did this one
D	oh okay
A	and er
A	he thought it'd er it'd combine but no
D	mm that's good
A	yeah
A	how long is it? oh it's about half an hour
D	mm
A	er
A	I woke up
D	house
A	we finally went to the one that was er cancelled yesterday
D	the
D	oh right yeah yeah yeah
A	literally just round the corner
D	yeah
A	it was really really good it's obviously in like a really really great place cos it's not fair far from where we are now
D	yeah
A	erm the only problem is not all the rooms are like identical
D	oh okay so is there one like like really tiny one?
A	picking the best rooms is a little bit interesting yeah
D	you can just draw straws like cos that way it's fair
A	yeah well there's that and the fact that like me and
D	yeah
A	of the world so er I I know
D	yeah
A	this time
D	okay
A	erm I dunno how it's gonna work out we wanted to talk to
D	mm
A	gonna go for it cos it is like quite popular but whether
D	tonight? oh she's coming here tonight?
A	she says she's in town now so
D	oh okay cool
A	so we're just gonna meet and discuss that
D	as long as they don't mind
A	probably not
A	mm
B	did it
A	no it didn't
E	the sauce is done
D	it's done?
E	the sauce is done
D	I'm checking it now
B	oh for fuck's sake
A	I said to
B	no
A	no it's
B	such a horrible mission
A	yeah it's letting you do it but it hasn't recorded it as Legendary
B	oh right okay well at least we can move on to the next
B	the thing is I've done it on Heroic
A	I know you've
B	that's what annoys me
A	I know
B	because I went on your Xbox it just wiped it
A	oh did it?
B	yeah
A	but I've done it on your Xbox and it's not wiped mine
B	dunno
A	I don't think so anyway mind you is Pillar of Autumn the last level?
B	might be
A	oh no Lone Wolf's there as well
B	oh yeah that's not really like
A	do you wanna go for it then? or?
B	er well I'm eating at the moment but
E	no
E	I'm still I'm still I'm about to eat
D	we're we're both about to eat
A	I'll do both
D	see how
D	oh my god please do it and see how
A	do you want me to try?
D	see how it works out
A	how the heck am I gonna do do this?
D	this is where you need four hands
A	this is where if I do that I can do trigger
A	and do stick trigger stick trigger stick trigger
D	can you do it with like can you just like let one of them die and then do it with the other one? will it still work? or will it
A	it could but oh right
D	will it be more difficult?
A	I could just do it like that yeah I'll just
B	you you can just use
A	I'll use you as a spawn point
A	I'd love to know what's happening in this cut scene
D	you could put subtitles on
E	well there's no point is there?
D	well why not?
E	are they saying words?
B	yeah
D	well they will be at some point won't they?
A	oh
D	yeah see?
D	see? what would you do without me?
A	it's so weird cos their voices are actually playing in my head right now
B	yeah
E	weird
E	weird
E	I can't imagine any voices go with that
B	does your character
E	yeah
B	or do you say like yes sir at the beginning
E	yeah basically
B	I can't remember
A	that timing though
A	Emile's chilled about everything let's be honest
A	oh see this is annoying so you get the AI don't you?
A	no no but like it's on your back
A	it's not on my back I don't think
A	and
B	no
B	no
A	I dunno how long this recording has to be but I think doing this mission on top of the one that we've just done might be a bit overkill
A	now you can how the heck do you do this?
A	yeah
A	this is how you do it on Laso
B	yeah
A	yeah I know
A	it will do at some point I'll just leave you on a bridge
A	I've played this game too much
A	oh
A	oh yeah you can get kicked by the Scarab like up the mountain
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I did a
B	oh no no no
A	oh
B	oh
A	there you go you've spawned
A	you're drawing fire it's alright
A	and you control this er getting shot at
A	you are still alive how?
A	mate you've got a shield and everything
A	I'm still on full health though which is quite impressive
B	Covenant got scared off by the Scarab
A	yeah but yeah if you get kicked by the Scarab you can get kicked like up the cliff and like
A	you go flying
B	Scarab just doesn't even care that I'm there
A	oh no
A	that was the checkpoint bit as well
B	I'll probably be spawning
A	oh
B	oh never mind I'm getting shot now
A	oh for
A	oh
A	move er
B	oh you've got a checkpoint
A	oh good yay we've got a checkpoint with no vehicle we need to make the
B	yeah I know that's what I was saying I thought you were trying to kill yourself
A	possibly
B	there's one
A	nice one boing
A	cool
A	yeah
A	from the er
B	done this mission so many times
A	yeah I've forgot you should wait in the tunnels before the er the Phantom disappears er before the Phantom disappears until the Phantom disappears cos otherwise you die the way I did when you do this jump
A	nothing's gonna shoot me now when I do the jump
A	you said backflip?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	ready for er mad mad Wraith boardings
A	oh
A	mother
A	right I'll spawn on you and then we're good to go
A	yes
A	hi hello this is my house welcome
B	take them out with you
A	try that again
A	mate we're ready for round three
B	watch him
A	like ah
A	mate round four is where it's at let's go
A	well he still has his face mask so
A	I presume I got him
A	I wanna catch it
A	what? why's this funny?
B	just it's seems a bit and again
B	and again
A	I wanna catch it no
A	you'd think they could put like an explosive like charge in like the armour so in the event of a Spartan's death it would like explode
B	that'd be an amazing armour ability
A	oh yeah
A	or no but like there's a delay or something or
B	mm
A	like a remote thing for like your squad mate
unknown_female	yeah
A	hey Grunt you just
A	I didn't even get a chance to move
A	beep-beep mother fuckers
B	oh
A	thank you for blowing up that installation my good friend
A	what?
B	how did you manage
A	I think er I think it all stuck in his shield and then exploded
B	oh I thought it bounced off shields
A	apparently I super-combined as a Jackal you saw it happen so
B	yeah I know yeah
A	where the heck did he go?
B	I thought
A	maybe it's the angle
B	mm maybe
A	holy
A	better get a Needler
B	there was one on the floor
A	can't wait to see this mentioned
A	do you reckon I could super-combine the guy out of it?
B	mm it's possible but I doubt it
A	probably best to just getting the er the rifle is there a sniper rifle in here?
A	no no no no it was right where I was as well
B	nice
A	what? I dodged that
A	you saw me dodge that didn't you?
B	headshot
A	I got head-shotted by a Wraith
A	mortar
B	yeah
A	yeah I did
B	yeah I saw you
A	oh right okay
D	oh cheers
D	I said oh cheers
B	you could do it yourself and be like punch this
A	yeah you can stand on it but then if you fall off it's just a little bit of a pain
B	yeah
A	where do I go now? oh I go up here sorry it's been a while
B	I'll go and wash my
A	oh sorry guys
A	like on my own on Legendary
D	is it difficult on your own?
A	yeah well
D	is it?
A	it's not
D	mm
A	definitely
D	oh okay
E	escusey
A	escusey
E	movey uppy
D	huh?
E	movey uppy
A	I'm
D	oh okay
A	oh there's a marine? when does this guy get here?
B	I'm so far away from you now
A	you're not cos I just died and spawned there
B	oh right okay
A	and I've just run back now oh wow
D	it's
unknown_female	mm
E	well
A	it's nice indeed
A	sorry my
A	my previous assessment of food was off
unknown_female	it must've been cos on the
A	oh god there's another one
A	oh I'll have that definitely I'll have that
A	did you see
D	oh I think I liked that gun
A	yeah it's good if you fire
D	mm
E	yeah how's everyone finding the er how
E	I was like oh we were just about to make tea
B	yeah
unknown_female	mm
D	yeah that was what
E	and er
E	Carter no
D	oh what is that?
E	that's a Scarab and Carter just crashed a Pelican into it
B	I thought that was a bit of a waste a Pelican and a Spartan to kill a Scarab
E	mm
A	er was it a waste? I think it yeah probably a little bit to be honest now if you think about it but Carter was oh my god we're not meant to jump off there
A	whoops
A	sorry guys
B	er how how many more times have you played this mission than me?
A	er alright okay
A	I'm gonna get a DMR hold on
A	I must go my people need me
A	I'd er to be honest Needler for this would be pretty dire to be honest
A	cos you've all the Buggers haven't you? they're actually called Buggers
B	mm
D	really?
A	and it's not swearing
E	well it
E	wait er er wait bugger's a swearing?
A	bugger?
B	yeah
E	yeah
A	bugger's swearing
E	that's swearing?
B	yeah
A	did you not know?
B	buggering is doing someone up the bum
D	is it?
A	yeah did you not know that?
D	I knew it was
E	I didn't know it was swearing
D	I knew it was swearing but I didn't know that's what it actually meant
A	yeah no you engage in buggery you engage in
D	mm
A	gay sex
B	you're buggered
A	I've got no shelter here mate
A	yeah I well I I had a DMR with ten shots cos you took it all
E	bruv is this Glee?
D	yeah
E	why?
E	don't join in
E	I will sing on my own
unknown_female	why doesn't Grunt birthday party apply to the Buggers though?
B	it'd be so satisfying
A	it well it would cos
A	killing these
B	yeah I am almost dead now one more shot I would've died
E	oh the
A	the banter it's all about that banter
B	throw some grenades at them in case they land
B	there's er er let the marine go in there
A	the marine? you mean Emile?
B	that's Emile
D	who's on the bottom of the screen?
A	I'm bottom
D	oh
B	oh I died
A	oh I'm out bummer
B	I died
A	oh I got the shot though oh I've picked up your ammo
B	very good
A	oh there's erm Skirmishers down here
B	oh fuck that
A	and there's another Bugger
B	yeah
A	there are several
D	it was good yeah
unknown_female	mm
A	got him oh my
E	yeah
A	oh you go on run around the corner dickhead sorry I'll try not to you should hear me censoring myself on this
D	no don't worry it's fine
A	I'm like holy er moley
E	I don't bother censoring myself
E	you either get all of me or none of me
A	no I don't wanna reload I wanted to pick up that weapon
unknown_female	yeah
A	I just picked up the er Needle Rifle
B	assault rifle suicide time
A	it's time I just shot the two that you just ran at
B	oh yeah I
D	you know I said I was gonna start eating slower? cos I
E	yeah
D	I get bloated really quickly?
D	yeah
D	I well I was just so hungry I can't wait I'm just like just like
E	well I get that as well
D	but like really recently I keep like eating way too much and then
E	way too much
D	like really my stomach really hurts afterwards
A	oh I just shot
B	you stole my
unknown_female	mm
A	what? I picked
B	yeah I killed that Skirmisher
A	it's alright there's a there's a grenade launcher there
B	I wanted I wanted it
E	er what what do we need the grenade launcher for?
A	oh it's erm
E	what's this map called in multiplayer?
A	er
E	it begins with a B doesn't it?
A	yeah we need to er
A	we need to we need to er combine fire on the Elites to get these down
B	right
A	I dunno if you wanna
A	do you? oh right okay
E	I might bring my
D	what?
E	mm
D	mm
E	Ocarina
D	wait which one did you bring?
E	I've got Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword with me
D	Ocarina of Time's the creepy one right?
E	no Majora's Mask is the creepy one
D	oh yeah
A	no
D	so how come both of those are like to do with time?
unknown_female	Zelda
D	Majora's Mask is to do with time isn't it?
E	that's cos it's a sequel to Ocarina
D	oh fairs
D	really?
E	the Zelda timeline
E	I'll show you the video that I got at school
D	mm
E	and the latest game is the first game in the chronology
D	oh really?
E	mm end of the timeline
D	thirty years? really?
E	thirty years
A	I am just emptying rounds into this guy and he oh there we go got him
B	yeah
A	okay you might wanna charge in
B	shall I charge?
A	yeah
B	oh there's a DMR here take that
B	er no I'll still shoot that
A	oh do you get the kill?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I saw I
B	I was gonna say
A	there's little Skirmishers
B	oh no
A	oh
A	hey I'm back oh I have ammo for some reason I just shot Emile in the back of the head
A	get let me get the Ranger
D	how come you guys have got friendly fire on? can you not turn it off?
B	that's just a thing of Halo
A	it's just yeah it's always
D	oh is it?
B	probably not very good
A	I'm dead oh you're dead
unknown_female	we're all dead
E	well
B	yeah
E	like cos in real life if you shoot someone in the back of the head
A	I took it back
B	who are you shooting at?
A	er we'll probably need to go for the Elite
B	jump up fire a couple of shots and then
D	to be honest if I played a game where friendly fire was on like I would probably be really bad
E	that'd be amazing cos
A	it's not like we're put in a situation where we're only gonna hit one another
D	no I know but I'm just that
A	like look we're literally looking
A	at like he's on the ground there I can see it says
B	yeah
A	hitting him's gonna be quite a challenge
B	most of the time is either explosives or on purpose so
A	yeah
A	I'm just having a look for weapons in here cos
B	er there's a new rifle here by the way if you wanna
A	er there's DMRs in here
B	I I I
A	there's DMRs in here mate
B	oh cool
A	there's loads of dead marines as well
B	I'm dead
A	enemy nearby? oh
B	yeah there are lots of enemies nearby
A	get up the stairs
D	you're just walking against the stairs
A	I know
B	right it's back oh I have a DMR now as well cool
A	yeah you might have armour lock as well
D	what's DMR?
A	designated marksman's rifle
D	oh cool
B	it's the gun in Halo that actually hits the thing that you point at
A	yeah
E	do you prefer the DMR to the battle rifle? or are you you're not?
A	alright cool
D	I like I like the pesto
E	mm
D	yeah
E	mm
A	I like you
B	against
A	oh yeah yeah
B	DMR's more satisfying
A	yeah I'd rather have a
B	cos er
A	yeah cos I the battle rifle they're essentially are single firing so the battle rifle just happens to put three rounds down for every one or the
B	okay
B	oh there's another one
A	oh right
A	oh my god I nearly just walked off the cliff can I get this white Elite?
B	yeah go for it
D	is the er is the Ocarina of Time the one where you can choose like different ways to go?
E	mm
D	because it
A	is the Ocarina of Time the one where you've got a erm
A	you've got a certain amount of time?
E	no
D	oh
A	is the Ocarina of Time the one where you've got a certain amount of time before some big evil's gonna come and
E	no that's Majora's Mask
A	is that that Majora's Mask?
unknown_female	yeah
A	ah I see
A	oh I just got off on the oh
D	this looks like a really cool game it looks like er the the plotlines are very detailed isn't it?
A	mm
D	exactly I like that
A	yeah I wish I'd got into Zelda to be honest
D	same
E	it's brill
A	me and Emile are working on this
A	thanks Emile a bit late on that Melee there but you know
A	yeah I know cos all the
B	oh right
A	could we move yours through
B	no I
D	so wait which one was actually created first?
E	mm
E	this one
D	which one?
D	so like almost the last one?
E	yeah
D	in the
E	and the latest one
D	in the in the timeline really?
E	no
D	you don't?
D	no but like the actual ones in like chronological order?
E	er
D	do you have all of them?
D	like all of those?
E	no no
D	oh
E	cos some of them are
D	oh you can only get them on DS?
E	no some of them are on the DS yeah but I can't be arsed playing Zelda on the DS
D	oh I'll do it on the DS
E	no
D	can I play them?
E	you could
D	oh
E	I've played a couple of them and just like mm it's not as good
D	also
D	can I can I did you say you had Pokémon on DS?
E	erm
D	which Pokémon do you have?
E	the latest one I had was like Platinum
D	could I could I play it please?
E	no
D	I haven't played Pokémon in ages
A	that's a cool story bro
E	I might have Ruby if you want
E	maybe
D	if anyone has Pokémon that they don't wanna play any more cos
E	I had silver but the silver doesn't fit in DS any more
D	oh
E	cos er the cartridge is slightly bigger
D	oh wait yeah it depends like it depends where DS gave it like cos they only have the older one well not the
E	oh no no it's not that it
D	not the old old I have DS Light
E	yeah yeah I had the DS Light and the Silver doesn't fit the DS Light the Silver only fit the Gameboy Advance SP
D	oh right okay
E	I had the Gameboy Advance SP
A	what?
unknown_female	what kind of rubbish is what?
B	that they make it a slightly bigger cartridge that only fits the SP
A	well not the cartridge it's no no
D	yeah
A	they made it slightly smaller after the new one came out but it's so that you
B	it's like
A	keep buying the newer games isn't it?
B	but the Gameboy Advance SPs played Gameboy Advance games
A	yeah I know but the Nintendo DS Light does not play Gameboy Advance games
B	it does
A	I I know but it doesn't play all of them cos one of them's a slightly bigger cartridge
A	my Pokémon Silver is erm it the cartridge is a lot taller like it sticks out the top you know how normally it would fit in the top and it would just kind of like rest there?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	the Silver would poke out the top and it's a little bit wider
B	oh right okay
A	but it it did fit the SP erm but it doesn't fit
A	no not yet I've had enough
E	I've got I probably I probably
D	mm oh
D	mm and these are all the games that
E	yeah
D	and how many of these have you played?
E	maybe make er I started that one
D	why?
D	oh why don't you like playing it on the DS?
E	I played
D	huh?
D	when was that created?
E	two years ago three years ago
D	oh was that the one where you just spent the entire evening?
E	er Christmas holiday and dinner
D	yeah cool
E	the amount of batteries
A	oh I could use armour lock that might help mightn't it?
A	oh a fuel rod gun yes
D	I really wish I had some chocolate or something
E	do you want one?
E	oh okay
D	not
E	oh and chocolate?
D	oh shit I keep forgetting about the chocolate
E	mm
D	I might have some later
A	I wanna get up these stairs here
B	oh right
A	I think there is a way to run across and erm yeah do I have to remove? no that's on the invasion map isn't it?
B	you what?
A	I was gonna say don't we have to remove a core or something? but that's on the invasion map
B	yeah that'll be the invasion yeah
A	chocolate?
A	oh yeah here's
B	er I'll probably kill myself with it but I'll give it a go
A	that wasn't me shooting the fuel rod gun
A	the fuel rod gun's there I'm gonna snipe
D	oh
A	not now I'll get the turret hold on
B	oh well yeah

unknown_female	I shot it at the at the turret
D	that's bad that's dangerous

D	why?
E	don't like you
D	oh please
A	oh well done mate dropped you missed
B	got the Ghost I think there we go

A	oh there's er
D	oh really? there's confetti?

A	I don't know where it is but you know I'm gonna have a look for it oh your fuel rod gun's still here
A	dunno if it still has ammo or not
E	oh
B	should keep a watch of that fuel rod turret's
A	why did you give me armour lock?
B	er it's probably quite useful with that fuel rod turret actually
A	I get
D	oh
A	yeah but now we've killed the fuel rod turret
D	oh
B	yeah
A	right erm stuff it we'll just run in

B	er can you do the same for me as well actually?
A	yeah sure
A	er not Emile
B	I was punching
A	punching
A	yeah it's friendly fire to us but the er the MPCs can't die I imagine they'd get very pissed off at the amount
B	also
A	of explosions
B	the enemies can kill each other very easily which is hilarious
D	really?
A	have you seen the many Wraiths that like just drive off the edge of the cliffs
B	yeah
A	and stuff? that's always
B	I've seen that happen quite a few times
A	that's the best thing about going on a Laso mission I forget
A	which one it is I think it's like the fourth mission do you remember when you're that one where you've gotta drive with Cat?
B	yeah I know the one yeah
A	erm nothing greater that than on that than er when you're doing Laso and you see one of the Wraiths drive off the side
A	and you're like yes that's just like half my workload
A	yeah
E	potatoes
A	oh yeah
A	right this this is the Pillar of Autumn now so clear the platform for
E	oh
D	in crisp packets it's only like a quarter of the packet's actual crisps
E	it's alright though actually
D	are they? are they is that a nice one?
E	yeah yeah
D	I can I can try it?
unknown_female	you cannot try it
D	I
D	yeah I know
E	yeah

E	always sniper rifle
B	I want to go like death run for some ammo but I'll lose my hologram I mean actually it's
A	I'm gonna get the er the Spikers the Spiker's pretty good all round to be honest cos when you get ammo for it it's not good for accuracy but it's good for just mowing down Shields
A	he knows
A	did I get the grenade off? no I didn't oh
B	ah I went grab and run
A	oh the grab and run
B	it's like a squid's ink thing

B	yeah I know yeah
A	try and get a well-placed grenade at the bottom of here oh god I just fell off the world er
B	I'll just throw a grenade over there
A	ah no I fell off the thing

A	really?
B	I have an assault rifle but I can't
A	well tell me next time and I'll not run in
A	oh for god's sake
B	erm there's a Brute or something over there with the
B	oh god yeah
A	oh
B	oh no I got head-shotted by a fuel rod
