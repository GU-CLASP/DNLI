A	so
B	and
A	and
A	and then
A	I was like oh
B	I'm just so glad she's not in our PE
A	she's in all of my classes and I don't even know why and
B	yeah but I can't believe
B	I know
A	yeah
B	on the way to
A	except she didn't even realise she was even in
B	yeah I know
A	she was like wait are you in my class?
B	that was so awkward I sit basically next to her
A	what the front?
B	erm no it's like in Dr
A	oh
B	so yeah yeah and we were talking to her on the way to lunch
A	yeah
B	and she was like oh I've got hockey next
A	mm
B	and for some reason
A	yeah
B	and I was like oh yeah that's a bit weird and she was like
A	yeah
B	because
A	yeah
B	even though she didn't take PE
A	yeah
B	so then everyone like you took PE they think they're really sporty
A	mm
B	well they are
A	they are really sporty
B	and
A	no
B	like she doesn't do any PE things and now suddenly she's joining hockey
A	yeah but I feel a bit sorry for
B	yeah
B	I know I know cos she always like I'm really bad at keeping eye contact with someone
A	mm
B	and talking to them
A	mm
B	I just whenever I'm talking I just kind of look off
A	mm
B	into the distance and it's not because I don't like
A	she's like
B	yeah and then you try and talk to her and she's just like
A	full on eye contact
A	mm
B	so you're like trying to smile
A	mm
B	and then she's
A	then you never know like what to say to her it's a it's a really awkward conversation I just don't like talking to her
B	yeah
A	and she's always like kind of and she's always like
B	sometimes like if you have one like subject that you both like agree with
A	mm
B	like have the same opinion on then it's okay for a while but it's just really awkward to like find something to talk
A	mm and erm also it's really awkward because she's like I'm going to the field
B	yeah I know
A	erm
B	she's never like shall we go to the field or?
A	mm
B	wouldn't you like to go to the field? she's like right we're going to the field
A	mm who's coming?
B	we could have just
A	mm
B	mm yeah
A	waiting for me to go for a wee like
B	yeah that's true
A	but
B	it's like the other lunchtime when
A	mm
B	when I think we were still waiting we were waiting for you to eat
A	mm
B	you
A	mm
B	she's like right we're going to the field
B	I was like what?
A	mm
B	and then so then
A	mm
B	and then
A	I don't think she really likes me
B	and then
B	and then halfway through you finished eating she was like shall we go onto the field now?
B	and I was like no you are finishing your sandwich
B	you are finishing your sandwich
A	and she was getting really
B	yeah then she's trying to do what
A	mm
B	she's like I'm going to the common room
A	then no one follows her
A	but then in science it's really awkward because
B	do you sit with them?
A	yeah we sit with them and they're like but you know like the different tables that me and
B	mm
A	and they're like that and then when we come over they're like
B	yeah it's like when they're together like
A	mm
B	in science last year were bad enough
A	it's like and then they're like oh what's that? what's that? and they expect us to explain it all to them I'm like
A	but it's actually it's
B	it was
A	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	she thinks she's like above
B	mm
A	I'm I'm doing that
A	yeah and they're like okay and so it was really awkward she keeps commenting on my Instagram photos like
B	oh no she does that to me as well
A	because
B	like
A	but if
B	yeah
A	like at one point
B	they have the whole like Instagram politics type
A	yeah like you like one they like one
B	yeah
A	so like I liked one of
A	but like obviously I I'm not just gonna go in and just randomly like them like I just got Instagram and I was like
B	yeah and like erm you know that photo of that crow I sent?
A	yeah
B	she commented I I was so confused cos she didn't I don't know she commented is that you?
A	yeah
B	and I was like what?
B	and and at first I thought it was on the climbing one so I was like oh yeah that makes sense but then it was the crow one
B	so I just think yeah
B	so what?
A	yeah like on my one where it was like
A	I was guessing it meant family and I was like so first I commented I was like what is famalam?
A	and then I deleted it I was like I can't say that and but she got all of these no actually cos I didn't tag her in them
B	oh right
B	it's there
A	no that's this one
A	it's on it
A	erm and then I was like and then I just deleted
B	I know she comments like I just seen a photo of that popcorn we made ages ago and she was like you two are so cute
A	I'm like
A	and then
A	yeah
B	and I felt so bad because I liked none of her photos
A	yeah because I don't really like liking cos she even Snapchats me and it's like like my recent photo
A	she actually asked me that every time she posts a photo she's like like my recent photo
A	so I just go no and then I like it and she's like ha ha ha you liked it I'm like yeah cos otherwise I see you cry
A	mm
B	oh my god some people ghost followers
A	you say everyone it's
B	yeah it's like you don't like my five recent photos I'm gonna unfollow you
A	yeah it's like woah
B	like for like if you like one of my photos I'll like two of your photos
B	it's like I don't care I just put some photos on
A	and then
A	my most liked photo was the one
B	but it's like
A	I got seventy-five million likes on this photo I'm like I don't care

B	she's like oh this is so cute I've got one coming as well and then
B	and I missed this all and I was like oh ha ha
A	I know
B	what do you mean?
A	like they would just randomly like my photo what about that
B	yeah like when you ah like ages after you've posted the photo and it's just random people
A	yeah
B	yeah I know
A	ah
B	I know and then there's I always feel really awkward when it's like someone like
A	mm
B	so they don't get that many likes so you can see who's liked it
A	mm but but then
B	cos it's like a picture of her spot cream
A	you know she likes all of my photos and I feel bad cos I don't like any of hers I'm like
