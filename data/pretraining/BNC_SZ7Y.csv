A	because really she'd resigned herself to the fact that they were always just going to be shit

A	to kind of straight into your mouth?
B	er it is hummus that's an option
B	I used to love that dress
A	mm
B	I know but in real life when you were a teen you always thought do you know what? When I'm older
A	when I'm older
B	I'll be able to wear that
A	mm thank you
B	I love it how the nineties fashion has back around already
B	is it twenty years ago now this?
A	well this
B	it must be pretty
A	this is like ninety-three or something isn't it? So nineteen years ago
B	oh then fuck yeah
A	mm
B	oh my God I can't believe that
A	no
A	the crab yeah
B	basically
A	and the fact that she is actually dead now
B	when the hell did she die?
A	last year
B	did she?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	she died of a drug overdose?
A	mm
B	mm
B	I can't believe how much he's still
A	I love
B	mm
A	mm
B	do you know strangely enough he was like the first person that I ever loved off the screen and erm it wasn't very long after I'd been with
A	mm
B	so they say you don't have a type but clearly I do
A	mm mm
B	oh
B	do you know what else I love? Ten Things I Hate About You
A	oh it's a classic
B	it was on Film Four not long ago and I've not got Film Four on this TV
A	is it?
B	I I don't I think it just reminds me of being young and I loved that she's so articulate in it
A	mm
B	and like
A	and their singing
B	and their singing
A	which I appreciate
B	and of course just gorgeous Heath Ledger
A	yeah
B	but I generally like Julia Stiles
A	I mean what's happened to her? All those people who were in teen films you know like erm the one that was also based on Shakespeare? She's All That
B	mm
A	like Freddy Prince Junior and that girl who was in everything
B	she's All That
A	yeah
B	erm
A	there was a whole spate of them wasn't there?
B	save The Last Dance
A	mm mm
B	all of those films
A	and I love and I used to watch Save The Last Dance on repeat
B	I learnt myself I taught myself how to do the dance
A	amazing
B	yep
A	I used to really like that
B	mm
A	mm
B	erm this
B	you know like they're supposed to be fifteen sixteen
A	mm mm
B	and they're like even the things that they say and that I saw how hard your breaking with
A	it wasn't but I think it felt like it
B	really?
A	everything is really hard when you're that age though isn't it? Everything is really extreme
B	mm
A	powerful and so extreme like I would say I blush now but then a boy I had a crush on a boy called
B	wow
A	yeah
A	it was insane and I think I actually missed that because everything that you were experiencing you were experiencing for the first time and all those emotions there are heightened because of
B	yeah
A	what you're going through
B	mm
A	mm? Two whole pounds?
B	wow
A	that's a tip
B	winner
A	this is nice have I seen this? Is that your jumpsuit?
B	this pattern?
A	mm
B	it's trousers
A	oh I like
B	you haven't seen them I haven't been able to fit in them before
A	have I not seen them? I like them though
B	I've had my sex top tucked into them
A	lovely
B	I remember really this is a really nice memory actually
A	that sounds a bit serious
B	yeah but I don't know how
A	I think you
B	just I went swimming twice a week
A	I I think that when you can it just comes up and you just don't eat for a day
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm and it was like a swoon moment you know like in one of those teen films and it was like oh and then I was  then I had him and his best friend fighting over me and I was like ooh ooh ooh
A	mm
B	then we went into sixth-form and they all stayed friends with me and then there was three of them all at it as well and I used to
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I remember this guy called Tom Stanton and the worst insult I ever got was we were in year nine and he found out that I fancied him and he was saying it to
A	but boys at that age are
B	mm
A	like he's it's that age and I think the thing is the what the the thing that worries me when about that story is that you now marry the two things so you marry losing all that weight and the boys fancying you and I think probably what actually happened
B	mm
A	was you lost the weight gained confidence and that's what boys find attractive
B	no
A	and I think you're very self-conscious
B	probably not
A	about that
B	mm
A	I think actually like if you look in the mirror now you are no you're a stunning girl and you get
B	yeah
A	approached by attractive blokes in clubs and if you think about all the the boys that you've had interest from they've all been attractive
B	but do you know what I think it is I think it's er a case of what's the word for it? I can't remember the name of it like say girls that weren't pretty at school develop a personality to me if they
A	yeah
B	weren't pretty at school then now you might still be pretty but you're thick you know what I mean?
A	mm
B	A little bit of an airhead there's not much up here? I think it's probably a bit of a like a marrying of both
A	mm
B	I see him now and I think why the hell did you even like him?
A	mm
B	and he's not even that hot
A	mm
B	like if I saw him now I would love to go
A	mm
B	telling
A	mm mm
B	like you know just for that
A	no well that's the thing cos it's those sorts of comments to those sorts of people are just throwaway
B	yeah
A	you know the stuff that you get called when you're at school like that's why I would never go back to school ever ever
B	remember when I said that
A	I was a bit of an arse
B	shit on someone else yeah
A	which is really it's I mean that's when you learn that's not acceptable behaviour but you're in all likelihood you're not in contact with those people anymore so you can't really make amends
B	do you know even if I really think hard I can't remember many girls that I was nasty about
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm mm
B	I wasn't very vicious but I feel like I am now
A	mm
B	like I said to my dad when when he came down at Easter we were sat in the Indian and I was taking the
A	mm
B	then it was some woman that had been mean to
A	mm
B	so I was taking the
A	mm
B	I'm just nasty all the time
A	mm
B	because I'm really critical now
B	I love it when Travis tries to throws himself out of the window
A	oh no
A	hilarious
B	there's so many one-liners
A	what the hell does that mean? Like a
B	mm
A	oh I like it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm I'm not afflicted with false modesty and I think
A	mm
B	we never use language like that now
A	that's the thing about reading the books I really like the books because they're so the
B	mm
A	and it's dying out and I don't
B	yeah
A	and I know and I you know
B	no I agree
A	and if that makes me sound like a snob then fine but I think it's  I think it's  important
B	oh no
A	get it in there
B	no I agree I find it quite
A	mm
B	professors teachers BBC
A	mm
B	I think it should be like RP like
A	mm
B	you should just if you pronounce things properly then why aren't you using the
A	mm
B	I suppose people don't read so much
A	mm clearly
B	no
A	not
B	mm
A	of the time and they like stories
B	Nancy Drew I used to love them
A	Nancy Drew
B	no
A	ridiculous
B	I'm shocked
A	like dampening down
B	oh crumbs
A	mm
B	yeah
B	I'm full already yeah fact like a pizza
A	ploughing on
B	mm mm
A	did he wish you a happy birthday?
B	I saw him this morning before I left and he didn't
A	I didn't we didn't ask him about the dentist
B	oh no
B	as long as he doesn't show me the nashers
A	yeah no I don't want to see that
A	I think it gets better every time I watch it
B	the puppet's got no arms and that's my favourite
A	such a weird little thing
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	is that sticking your child in a car seat?
B	shocking that isn't it?
A	mm
B	I didn't until I saw that advert I had no idea it was like that
A	really? You'd think  you'd think  that it would be you'd still get some you'd still be breathing in something
B	in the car
A	no you wouldn't
B	yeah
A	you wouldn't risk it would you?
B	no
A	mm
B	well I can't I wouldn't think twice about getting in a car and saying to passengers do you mind if I smoke?
A	mm
B	if I'd have fricking seen that even like how you how can you be so rude
A	no absolutely
B	as to ask do you mind if I just cover you in smoke
A	A bit of cancer
B	I mean a bit of cancer shoved in your face
A	mm mm
B	I was like okay er what's she into and she said reading
A	yeah
B	erm what about that? And she was like oh I don't know and I said why because their
A	oh whoa
B	it's like what how has religion I couldn't understand it
A	yeah
B	how does it marry up?
A	it's weird it's
B	yeah magic I've never known this before
A	mm
B	so Christian people are against magic?
A	and horoscopes
B	mm
A	God ultimately hasn't planned for you horoscopes you're reading the stars is bollocks and you're not supposed to believe in horoscopes if you're Catholic or a Christian
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I forget the name of it
A	cult
B	yeah it basically is yeah
A	solid
B	I've got some serious
A	yeah I feel a bit sick now
A	he has got good genes because it doesn't look like he's aged that much does he?
B	no
B	he is hot though whoever he is
A	mm mm
B	I used to love this dress as well
A	okay
B	which go to a double D which by the way I can now fit in
A	really
B	yeah
A	your boobs have shrunk?
B	my boobs have shrunk
B	oh god just seeing her just reminds me how much I used to idolise her
A	mm
B	you know designer dresses and long blonde hair
A	early twenties I think
B	he really hasn't aged much at all
A	oh there's
B	well they don't really see him as like a member of the family do they?
A	who is he? He's the son of his of who?
B	his ex-wife
A	of his ex-wife right
B	my tongue is hurting
A	yeah my tongue hurts I've just nipped it or something
B	yeah
A	oh belly's gonna get you and it's got me
B	oh
A	so cute
B	that is such a bad fall
B	do you know actually that's really just reminded me I was in year four I think when this came out
A	really?
B	she was such a
A	really?
B	learning it yeah
A	mm mm awkward
B	she's so sweet
A	she's absolutely adorable
B	I remember it so well like I watched it last week
B	my mates never copped off with anyone we always stuck together
A	how what say again?
B	I recall like when we were in sixth-form that everyone and anyone turned eighteen they'd have parties at the local rugby club they would hire it out
A	mm
B	and that was normal that was acceptable
A	right okay
B	I think so
A	I don't see myself as
B	like it shocked me when we were watching that programme the other day what was it we were watching? And you were like I I wished I had her dress and her body and her face and her
B	and I was like what the fuck are you talking about?
A	well yeah but that but you would say that
B	like she she compared to you
A	well no because you think that because you're my friend and
B	no
A	no
B	because you don't have to
A	because I can't be arsed
B	because you don't have to wear it
A	except I don't see myself as
B	if I
A	particularly attractive at all I never have and so
B	you're fucking nuts
A	but but the thing is at the one the very few few times you've been questioning me on this I think well I've been me for my whole life
A	not in life I know
B	yeah some people aren't some people
A	I am so much a not I'm the first one
B	you're not
A	no I am and I'm not saying this for you to
B	no
A	to make me feel better and like
B	well I'm not saying it to make you feel better but the first thing that
A	well that's very
B	yeah
A	phew I
B	like if I
A	yeah but I always think like when I see you in the morning and you're not wearing any make-up you are really like that because
B	oh
A	have you just chopped your leg in half?
B	yeah in half
A	I you know I I am that sort of person and I you know I think less is more and obviously when when you walked
B	but that's nice though because when you get ready to go somewhere you look completely different
A	mm
B	whereas if I put more make-up on to go out really I risk looking like a drag queen
A	it seems unlikely
A	why is she red?
B	because she's flustered but I think basically she's just put blusher on that much
A	I don't know what's happening
B	oh I never checked the car for my fricking ID did I?
A	mm
B	let me check that top drawer
A	everything is crossed
B	I'm just that good
A	oh have you got it?
B	oh yeah
A	you're a fricking genius
B	I think it did
A	yeah
B	that'll make me feel better
A	yeah probably you're probably right
A	bless you
B	I don't know what made me think I could fit all the courses in
A	you bloody maniac
B	that is quite serious now
A	are you dying? That's probably the most food you've had in a very long time
A	thank you forever
A	actually yeah I don't know why I'm trusting you with that
B	I'm not going to lie it doesn't look very fizzy now
B	yes that's why we all employ it
A	ooh look at the fizz thank you
B	yeah look at this look at
A	they're so brown
B	I was lathering it all on and it's
A	what is it? Does it say after sun on it? Does it say
B	plus
A	plus fake tan?
B	after sun lotion plus tan enhancer and that's all I read
A	yeah your plus tan enhancer what did you think that was?
B	I don't know
A	you bloody idiot
B	I'm gonna continue to put it on my legs I certainly will not continue to put it everywhere else
A	erm so you know the Jameses all the Jameses it sounds like one of them is called Leo
A	just to confuse me when I've been like
B	yes I think you need to get this guy to send more photographs
A	I did ask him if he had fake tan on on his face or
B	lies
A	actually I might have downloaded them
B	lies
A	lies absolute lies
B	that is fake tan on that face
A	that is isn't it? That's not real tan
B	no
A	you can tell it's fake tan
B	that's fake tan
A	that looks orange
B	yeah I think that's fake tan
A	and that's photo number two
B	who took that photo?
A	well it must be delay on the camera and he said he took it today
B	that's an orange face
A	orange face so
B	yes
A	but he's a nice guy so I'm willing to forgive him
A	they're screaming
B	who's
A	oh
B	my dad
A	who made it? He made it himself?
B	no he can't have
B	Tesco's Finest
A	it's really really pretty it's really different I've never seen anything like it
B	no I haven't
A	no it's nice
B	mind you that's why I like it
A	mm
A	he does look a bit like Jason Priestly though doesn't he? That's quite funny
B	which one's Jason Priestly?
A	he was in nine zero two one zero
B	two one zero I thought you were gonna say that
A	literally you'd shit your pants
B	yeah
A	oh it's back it's alive
B	the mint green but that was more sage but
A	mm
B	the dark side that came in last summer
B	that dress she's got on with the feathers
A	the feathers
B	that's in Zara now
A	is it?
B	yeah
B	oh God
B	that's what my dad means homemade
A	right opening a jar of sauce
B	compared to my dad's usual dinner is whatever goes in the oven
A	ah fine
B	Tesco's Finest you know three for ten pounds or whatever it is too too darned determined and he just tries for one
A	oh
B	he's the cutest I really can't wait for you to meet him
A	yeah I'm really looking forward to it
B	like if it wasn't weird I'd love him and
A	mm
B	Cos they would just get on so well
A	mm
B	like she's she often
A	really?
B	in her whole life yeah
A	mm
B	so I'm scared that he's gonna meet someone
A	mm
B	do you know what I mean? And I don't think really anyone's going to be able to appreciate what he's been through in the past kind of three years cos you can't unless you know someone that has
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	because it's so strange
A	yeah
B	but I'd love for them to get together
A	but they're not related are they?
B	no
A	she's your she's
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like
A	but they are like brother and sister?
B	they could
A	oh really?
B	yeah my dad helped her through her divorce by
A	yeah you were saying
B	erm and she last weekend offered my dad money cos he's really getting hard up now
A	right
B	erm and obviously he's too proud to accept it but we were on about going up to
A	mm
B	provided for me
A	mm
B	you know had this happened twenty years ago in time clocks back
A	yeah
B	then twenty-five would be a suitable age to be expected to have a family home and be financially well off
A	mm
B	and I just feel so bad that I can't help him
A	but there's the thing you would never expect it do you know what I mean like?
B	no
A	you would never
B	no
A	that that's
B	like you weren't even told stuff now
A	what they were doing
B	at all
A	but I mean it it's such a fine balance though isn't it? Because like with my mum I often find that there's stuff that I know that she's holding back and I think on the one hand I'd quite like her to tell me or or at least feel she's able to tell me
B	it's a fine line isn't it?
A	it's a really fine line and you know you want to be there as a support for your parents when you're an adult but you know that I think that basically you expect that they're always gonna be the person to provide
B	mm
A	no matter what
B	even if they don't want to
A	yeah and like with my dad my dad's really proud and and my older brother is pretty well off financially because obviously like he bought my dad a a super deluxe lovely TV for Christmas and never comes to visit us but that's they don't
B	yeah
A	sort of back back to that oh it's so easy I'm just here for a cup of tea or whatever
B	yeah
A	whereas I think if you came for a visit it makes it into a bigger deal
B	yeah definitely
A	but I suppose because they see each other less frequently
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and like when he  when he  came before ordinarily I would have paid for dinner and and
A	mm
B	with the car and everything
A	mm
B	because
A	okay
B	so I paid for it erm and gave it to the guy at the counter and dad was stood there and I said do you want to take your coffees over and I'll wait for the third one? And he said Oh no it's okay and the guy came over because I'd distracted dad I was quick enough to give him the forty pound cash for a thirty-nine pound bill that
A	nice
B	erm and he said what are you doing? and I said I'm paying for the dinner and he said well no cos I'll pay for dinner
A	mm
B	erm and I said just say thank you and let me pay for just one thing out of everything please
A	mm
B	it's a bit ridiculous
A	mm
B	even if even something that he he that I was going to pay for myself because I've had the cash for
A	mm
B	he wouldn't have it
A	yeah yeah
B	he doesn't have it
A	yeah
B	and he came into my room before he left and I was just writing him an Easter card to put in his case to say thank you erm for coming down
A	mm
B	do you know what I mean?
A	mm
B	he would have paid he would have left more money so I know he's skint and I know he's telling
A	God
B	yeah he's really really
A	he still wanted
B	bad
A	to pay for dinner
B	yeah
A	to provide for you
B	that part where he's I've given him every single excuse for him to be able to just say okay then I'll let you on this occasion he still won't do it
A	absolutely
B	for your dinners when you get here and
A	mm
B	and I never had that expense because I don't call to you
A	absolutely yeah yeah yeah
B	and said oh
A	it's just a pride thing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and he just he's you know he missed his mortgage
A	oh God and you didn't know that? No
B	nope
A	right
B	and he had to do work on one of the houses in order to re-let it so he'd got crap loads coming out of a pot for Christmas so the mortgage payment was three weeks late
A	right
B	erm and he went in and he saw them and said oh yeah I know it's just because I had to redo
A	so she was just spending the money on herself?
B	yeah on the house on on the drive all that shite
A	on that gravel her lovely gravel
B	yeah they've said they basically said to him now they're going to start legal proceedings against repossession for the
A	for the bungalow?
B	yeah
A	shit man
B	yeah and I was like are they fucking being serious? Mum's got three and a half grand in her account maybe more than that actually
A	Jesus
B	she's sat in the bungalow with all the furniture
A	yeah yeah yeah and he's living in a sleeping bag and can't make his mortgage repayments
B	yeah
A	right yeah
B	yeah
A	and she's done nothing
B	and she's done nothing has she? So he said well fuck it I don't care she should have said to the building society
A	because that money has got to be from him because she doesn't work so where has that money come from?
B	it came from when they they had work done on the bungalow when they first moved in there put a pipe in and it wasn't done properly
A	okay
B	so they got money from the insurance company for that time
A	and she just put that aside?
B	she got it yeah
A	and she got it? How does she live with herself? Like that that's the thing that I just don't understand is like even if the  if the  query is like is she sane or is she not or is she just evil or is she insane? How can you be that detached like how can you be that
B	yeah
A	emotionally void?
B	that's why when he said she was going to ring me today I freaked out
A	mm well yeah you would cos when was the last time you spoke to her?
B	three years ago
A	has it really been three years?
B	I spoke to her
A	yeah yeah yeah
