A	okay
B	erm we made a rap and I had two verses

A	oh but it's
B	it
A	beat and beat? mm

C	oh hello
A	so why do you think rhyming is a good idea?
C	because it gives you rhythm
A	mm but
B	yeah
A	what does that why does that why might that matter?
B	because
C	because you can really annoy someone
A	well I suppose so
B	no because you can like do any rhythm you want like when I was in the house one day I saw a little mouse and hey
A	and they
B	and
C	and they
A	and they
A	squeaked and squeaked
C	and boogied and boogied
A	and ran away
B	I saw some little mouse saw a little mouse one day and then
C	that but
B	I saw some little mice one day and then hey they went squeak squeak squeak and ran out of the house
B	so like the rhythm cos I wrote
A	gives you a frame doesn't it?
