A	although people say I'm fibbing  I don't know
B	and so do you speak French and German when you go when you travel?
A	I don't the thing is I've only been to Germany on at an airport Hamburg I think
B	uh-huh
A	I went to Dijon in Paris and so and I went with my mate to Paris and although he's got better qualifications than me he couldn't speak any French
B	em or just tick the the most recent
A	post graduate
B	yeah
A	retired
B	that's
A	topic
B	I don't know what we'll talk about yet
A	how many years have you lived here? Eh well I've lived here since I was I've been away but only for not to live anywhere else
B	mm
A	so I'll just
B	were you born in
A	I was born at
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	uh-huh and both of your parents were from?
A	no my mum's from Norway
B	ah oh really?
A	she's Norwegian
B	oh okay that's why you speak Norwegian
A	they were pen  They were pen  friends
B	aw
A	then she came over
B	aw
A	she was middle
B	how did?
A	oh god
B	how did they become pen friends?
A	she was a nurse and he was in the army
B	oh okay
A	during the war they used to do that
B	mm hm
A	so that you know you'll meet I don't know
A	well I'm glad they met
B	whatever you like
A	no no no no no
B	mm
A	and it was my dad working class and all his family
B	mm hm
A	Great at Christmas
B	ooh
A	Great Christmas and
B	it must eat up most of your salary no? Presents for the family?
A	I don't know I mean eh they didn't have salaries
B	really?
A	and they had boot clogs or something they oh eh they're poor
B	where was this round here?
A	yeah I mean my dad my granddad was born in Bromsgrove but they lived in Birmingham
B	oh no
A	yes
B	oh my no
A	I know
B	gosh
A	and I was the one cracking jokes on the in the kind of cos I it didn't sink in to me till about six months later
B	yeah
A	then it hits you
B	gosh
A	it was a sort of delayed reaction
B	oh dear
A	but these things are for everybody though
B	yeah
A	and eh it's like a lot of things until you've had things happen you can't really empathise with anybody else
B	mm
A	you can talk in a certain way but unless you've been in a relationship that's died or you've had relatives or you've messed up this that and the other
B	mm
A	unless you've done that
B	mm
A	you don't you can't empathise
B	yeah
A	people say you just normally
B	mm
A	you're more likely to
B	yeah to be able to understand what that person's going through
A	so linguistic origin now
B	yeah and so
A	she's a well my mum's a brick
B	mm
A	she just keeps it all in
B	mm hm
A	they're slightly tanned without going in the  in the  eh sun
B	she's a hoarder
A	paper
A	em things and you know and I think and I look at some of the things and I thought blimey this I know where I get all these things
B	mm
A	and I'm usually right
B	mm hm
A	but she doesn't she only tells you what she wants to tell you
B	mm
A	and if people some people are always asking and prodding and they never get anywhere because people and I'm not saying anything to him he's got a big mouth and the gossip
B	mm
A	so I don't know it's not a big deal really
B	so where do you normally go walking?
A	well I'm I'm the team leader I organise all the walks
B	oh okay
A	so I I organise two walking groups
B	is it an
A	not a big organisation now
B	mm hm
A	and the other one we retired when I retired every Tuesday second week during the day we go on a ramble and they could invite their friends relatives neighbours whatever
B	super
A	there's more women on the one on Tuesday and on Sunday it's about fifty fifty
B	mm hm
A	eh sometimes it's a small number like five or six sometimes it's twelve thirteen fourteen
B	mm hm
A	eh but it's good because there's no and the reason they like it is because there's no eh obligation if you don't want to turn up for one two or whatever you can turn up out of the blue that's fine
B	mm hm
A	there's no eh it's totally unconditional
B	where is your favourite place to go walking?
A	well weather makes a difference
B	mm
A	but em I like em I went to the peak cos the Peak District isn't too far away
B	mm
A	Cos once you hit Litchfield which is only twenty-five miles away then it's just about another half an hour
B	mm hm
A	from there and you're at
B	mm
A	lovely river
B	mm
A	that's why I mean bell ringing just happened just because I like
B	oh do you do bell ringing?
A	I do bell ringing
B	oh fantastic
A	Cos em what's her name?
B	uh-huh
A	logo and stuff
B	uh-huh
A	and I do that on
B	uh-huh
A	but the thing is I used to get a bus to Kings
B	oh no
A	it's just a piece of string you hold onto as you go down
B	oh
A	yes
B	so you're actually ringing the bells in the churches or are they hand bells?
A	no they're church bells
B	fantastic
A	ay
B	can I come?
A	yeah if you want to come along
B	Cos I used to where I used to live in Spain
A	yeah
B	a place called Murcia it had a cathedral and loads of different churches
A	if you and
B	yes
A	that way you'll feel better then
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	Cos but you're right cos usually it's beginners on a Friday
B	mm hm
A	eh there's two blokes that are learning at the moment and one guy nearly packed up because what they think they think it's just pulling a rope
B	yeah
A	and it just all it won't
B	yeah
A	and I'd I'd done it for a year then I stopped because the people that helped me one guy Ray he
B	mm hm
A	but the thing is close family and stuff sisters and stuff
B	mm hm
A	and the nearest ones are in Winchester that's got a cathedral down there and he had no reasons to stay except for the bell and so I went down there he moved down there and he was really helpful to me
B	mm
A	because you might as well be dead
B	yeah
A	so I mean I stuck with my chess I kinda played chess for Warwickshire county player
B	oh really?
A	and I like chess but I don't like the people I'm with
B	mm
A	because they're they're I mean as I said to
B	mm hm
A	eh
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so you're watching and they'll say come along we'll just help you a bit
B	mm hm
A	and sometimes I get there it was raining and I get soaked
B	mm hm
A	and I did that for a year
B	mm hm
A	and she's a laugh
B	mm hm
A	and I used to like going there and eh she used to bring in cakes and bake cakes and everything and she was like it was more like a social club
B	yeah
A	more than anything else
B	did you learn any Norwegian?
A	oh yeah
B	were you speaking Norwegian in the class? Was it?
A	yeah and then I stayed another year but the thing
B	mm
A	but em they all all the people in the group said you've got to go in the high group you can't stay in this
B	mm
A	or left or whatever
B	yeah
A	so under the great hall there's a whole office with lecture theatres and he said we can get this room for X cheap amount of money and the most of the money will go
B	is it run by the university?
A	no it isn't
B	oh
A	it's run by em we just pay this guy who'd eh who gets it all tax free
B	oh brilliant
A	well that's not gonna
A	but he
B	mm
A	but you know what it is when you see you just see one aspect of something and
B	mm hm
A	sometimes people do take eh oh I don't like that
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so em
B	but pushy in what way? That he was pushing you to speak more and learn more or?
A	well eh when he'd covered everybody was away except me and this other woman so it was nonstop asking questions
B	mm
A	and stuff and I and he's he's a very academic sort of guy who he he was brought up in Norway eh and he's married to I don't know he's
B	yeah
A	there's nothing worse than when you're in the group and everybody's laughing and you're thinking what the? You know and you can't look like you don't know what's going on
B	do you feel you've improved a lot since you?
A	ah my Norwegian's better but it's I'm doing a level in a way I it's too difficult for me
B	right
A	but the others said to me so what you're learning because you're not realising it there's certain things that are sinking in even though you're not aware of it
B	yeah yeah
A	because because eh
B	naughty boy
A	but sometimes I mean like anything I thought if I get if I'm stuck I'll go to ask my mum to help me because she's eighty
B	oh okay
A	does the old Norwegian
B	right
A	so eh
B	mm hm
A	you know and she's eighty-nine and I'm thinking
B	yeah
A	but you don't do that on your own time you just expect I mean she still thinks I'm a
B	aw
A	here's your card
B	that's a mum's prerogative though
A	you know and I'm thinking if I'm sixty next year and she's treating me like I'm a so but that's that's
B	but going back to you being in a higher class than maybe your level is that's actually quite good if you're  if you're  if you feel confident in that class
A	well I'm
B	as as opposed to just learning the language you're actually acquiring it
A	when I'm in a group situation if I'm not confident with the topic I'll I'll I'll compensate by being more myself like I am now
B	mm hm
A	and I'll interrupt and say
A	well I don't know
B	yeah
A	and if you don't want to bollock them you've got to work out how to get the best out of them without making them feel that they're being sort of marginalised cos if you marginalise kids or people
B	yeah
A	it's obvious if you've got any common sense what their reaction's gonna be they're just gonna get more marginalised and they're not gonna get involved
B	yeah they'll be demotivated
A	so eh I would work out strategies that eh blur the actual reality
B	uh-huh
A	so that they feel part of it
B	mm hm
A	when I left Sheffield and got me I got my degree in chemical engineering and field technology and not maths
B	mm hm
A	em then I left cos I cos my dad had just died
B	mm
A	I didn't I graduated when I was twenty and I didn't sort of
B	Butlins?
A	Butlins
B	mm hm
A	at
B	oh
A	but that was the best way to learn
B	mm
A	because then I went to
B	mm hm
A	and had just started when you're going to do teacher training and stuff
B	mm hm
A	I me I had come from a I had just been eaten alive in an inner city Birmingham school
B	clue
A	about anything
B	yeah
A	so what happened was I ended up at eh I the schools I ended up
B	oh
A	mega rough
B	mm hm
A	and the kids were all disturbed there and strangely enough they had Maths there you're doing alright here? I said yeah I know
B	how long did that take?
A	bloody ages
B	yeah
A	and then the head of the school at Mickleover where I was he ran a chess team and he found out I could play chess and I won all my games for him
B	brilliant
A	and eh it was amazing really that eh you know
A	but I know but the thing is what I  what I  realised when I left there was that the people running it aren't haven't got their finger on the pulse and even now
B	mm hm
A	if you're in the certain management situation you just want to maintain your job you don't want to ruin your job your immediate high people so you just pretend
B	mm
A	and the ones at the bottom are being eaten alive
B	yeah
A	so what? It's their problem they're the ones that haven't got a proper strategy
B	well I I just felt that eh the tutors in university knew that it was a completely unrealistic situation
A	oh yeah
B	but they were pretending that it wasn't just because
A	okay
B	otherwise everything just breaks down I mean
A	mm
B	while you've got all you've got to cater to the visually impaired students you've got to cater to the hearing impaired students
A	yeah
B	generate their own materials
A	mm
B	that will stimulate conversation
A	yeah
B	or stimulate you know reading skill or level
A	Cos what he does cos it's
B	mm
A	or a walk or something
B	oh planking yeah
A	yeah
A	and then this other one which something ironing where you have to put an ironing board
B	on a motorway
A	or on the top of a hill or on a bloody
A	very crazy
B	yeah but I mean you know at least you know where you're coming from
B	mm
A	I don't know why but em no I mean you've got to have a bit of eh you've got to have an edge somehow
B	mm
A	just to give some momentum in a situation
B	yeah yeah
A	otherwise and I mean that's the trouble and a lot of the people I work with
B	what in the classroom?
A	I got oh my god I've got pictures of me em when I was at
B	uh-huh
A	I was there for two years
B	very scary
A	I know
B	really?
A	stop boys fighting they'll stop
B	mm hm
A	you get in the way of two girls they won't stop trying to hit each other
B	passion involved in a girl fight
A	oh
B	so how did you cos one of the biggest problems I found in the classroom was I mean obviously your Norwegian class everyone who goes there is motivated
A	yeah
B	they've got their internal motivation reasons that they want to learn
A	yeah
B	so they come and they're happy to be there and they're happy to
A	well
B	participate
A	well
B	and also kids don't  kids don't  want to learn a foreign language
A	I know that's I mean I know with maths
B	mm
A	and you look after you make your hair all
B	yeah
A	so I have a mixture of fear they have a mixture of fear and
B	mm
A	given an opportunity they'll like if they're away to cover
B	mm hm
A	and all the kids associated with the room that day my room as a place where nobody played up
B	mm that's good
A	and it's strange how you do
B	mm
A	but em and also I never used to send the kids to the management
B	mm
A	ever
B	that's good
A	and I never made threats
B	mm
A	you have had it
B	yeah
A	Cos they'll push it so I never and I said
B	mm hm
A	and then they were thinking no he isn't
B	mm hm
A	and then I used to say well I'm gonna have the first week I'm not gonna do any maths we're just gonna learn what you've got to do to be behave for me
B	mm hm
A	and then  And then  I said rules like you don't come late and then I used to say I don't want you to go on
B	mm hm
A	I never used to eh go on and just say and what about your books? And I said here's a book and I said one and here's another one
B	yeah
A	by getting them why? Somebody's put some graffiti on it
B	okay
A	but I only thought of a nail a drawing pin at one end
B	mm
A	I don't just do it quickly so it all sinks in because the teachers worry about the bright children in class
B	mm hm
A	they're going to follow it anyway
B	mm
A	if you let that sink in big time at the start
B	mm hm
A	later on they might be they doing it with other and when they do start getting away with things with other people unless you've made a big deal about it you're going to be on the receiving end
B	yeah yeah definitely
A	but
B	I think that's what had happened in my in the school that I was in that basically senior management
A	what school was it?
B	em the one I told you about last last week in Bournville?
A	oh Bournville
B	and I think senior management hadn't got just at the top-down discipline and so the
A	was Nick Osbourne still there in PE?
B	oh I don't know
A	we used to go there and play basketball
B	oh yeah
A	and we went to the Country Girl and I had my car nicked from the car park there
B	oh doesn't surprise me that area is was a bit dodgy
A	and do you know me mates asked when he give a little
B	didn't help you or anything
A	no no no
B	nice bloke
A	I went to King's Heath police station to report him and you know what the policeman said to his mate? Thank god that's not on our patch
B	oh god
A	in Bournville
B	mm hm
A	and that in a way you get inured in and hardened to
B	mm hm
A	eh I had to start it with a screwdriver somebody had all my marking my tapes my books everything CDs they nicked
B	oh no
A	yeah they they'd screwed the doors with a screwdriver the coursework nicked I was gonna mark
B	oh no
A	yeah I got in trouble over that
B	you got in trouble?
A	yeah initially I did till I told them
B	oh no
A	you know
B	why would they steal coursework?
A	they didn't know what was in it
B	oh
A	they just took everything and then just like what they do when they burgle a house
B	mm
A	so that was that
B	and what did the kids have to do? Do the coursework again?
A	no
B	mm
A	what people don't realise when they're younger anything you see somebody who's a lot older than them the things that happen to them the chances are fifty or sixty percent of the things happening to them you're gonna have
B	mm hm
A	or maybe more
B	yeah it's getting through the
A	but things like
B	awful things
A	either meeting having a nasty experience with people or in that or a health scare
B	yeah
A	or a job it may be losing a job or getting demoted
B	mm
A	or not keeping whatever or if you've got family split up or your kids are in trouble
B	mm
A	I'm not saying it's but it's a combination of them or
B	yeah
A	even families that are sort of stable you know like
B	yeah yeah
A	because they they say they work hard and they've got all this and then all of a sudden they realise things have got to they've got to sacrifice things
B	yeah
A	you know I mean my sister I mean my nephew is at
B	wow what does he do?
A	he's a big chief exec for an induction company
B	really?
A	but it's
B	mm
A	and he got so he had to find somewhere and then this he got rapid promotion
B	mm hm
A	so it's just luck really
B	it is
A	but I mean you know I mean
B	yeah I know it's true
A	it's all
B	I went I got mugged when I was thirty and they broke my jaw I broke all my bones down my arm
A	was this in Birmingham?
B	no that was in Barcelona when I lived there
A	Cos Barcelona I mean my my friends went there and em they got robbed
B	oh it's yeah I was teaching I was training teachers to be English teachers and we'd have like thirty students every month and at least two of them would get mugged on a it was a monthly thing
A	but then you didn't know that you'd been robbed till you got back to your?
B	no
A	they were really sophisticated
B	yeah yeah yeah they they've got so many methods of doing it
A	so they didn't intend to break your arm?
B	no
A	I thought they were just gonna broke your arm
B	no they didn't do it like
A	oh
B	here take this bang bang bang
A	no I mean
B	but still
A	I know if it's the case it's the big place for robbery in the whole of Europe
B	yeah
A	and Rome is not too good either they say
B	mm hm
A	but I mean you know when things like that happen it does make you well it takes a while to sort of feel confident to go out again
B	definitely but I I would have got over that fine but the problem was that the consequences of me being ill I got sacked from my job for while I was off sick and I had to take them to court
A	mm
B	cos it was illegal what they'd done
A	and what did they do?
B	they just sent me to a lot of different specialists that told me
A	is it sorted now?
B	kind of I still have problems
A	yeah
B	and so I had to take so much time off on my next job
A	mm
B	because sometimes I couldn't even hold my head up eh or breathe properly
A	which university?
B	in Murcia in Spain
A	yeah
B	and cos they did dodgy work contracts over there because they don't want to make you permanent because they have to
A	yeah
B	pay more social security for you
A	right
B	and so Murcia University were illegally employing us and one of teachers complained to the department of employment who came and did a big inspection and and said
A	so anyway you got punished for?
B	yeah it was just being bang bang bang and that's
A	yeah
B	in the end the reason why I moved back to England and thought I'll carry on being a teacher I'll do a PGCE
A	yeah
B	and then it was the difference it was just such a shock to get into
A	behaviour
B	the behaviour was a nightmare I mean I've taught all ages and levels of kids in Spain and yeah there's you know they are they're kids aren't they?
A	mm
B	they're gonna play out they're gonna misbehave but there was no hostility there was no violence
A	how many schools have you taught in here then? Was it all secondary schools?
B	yeah
A	if you get have you ever thought of private schools?
B	yeah
A	I mean you could still get them playing up but they play up in a totally different way
B	mm hm
A	eh I don't know I mean it's
B	mm hm
A	for criminals
B	mm hm
A	in your I mean what language would you be able to teach just Spanish or?
B	french and Spanish yeah and because of the EBac that is in at the moment is being brought in
A	yeah
B	you know a language for a lot of people is gonna be essential
A	oh you?
B	to get their EBac so I think there's going to be quite a lot of teaching jobs
A	it's just that I
B	but I just don't know whether I'll be able to cope I mean you say that all teachers and are so stressed and don't get to enjoy their holidays cos they're always working
A	well the thing is I mean it might sound bad in one way but because I wasn't married or had kids myself
B	mm hm
A	in a way it was a benefit in one way because some of them used to go home and I'm not saying their marriages were on the rocks but to have their strong marriage you're got to put a lot in to it
B	yeah yeah
A	and so that means you've got to be eh either understanding or say you have eh not in the right frame of mind one way and you've got to do A B C D and you if I come home I don't want to do anything I just used to do what I liked
B	mm hm
A	which is basically either soak in the bath or go to bed eh or just chill out
B	mm
A	and I mean I I I I didn't know I had diabetes for a while so I'd end up going on that
B	really?
A	but there must be other teachers going in and having other things going on with them
B	yeah
A	so you know and it is a stressful job
B	mm hm
A	I stopped I retired in two thousand and eight
B	mm hm
A	so I could get on the photocopier and then chill before we started
B	mm
A	so is it was only the last fifteen years at Hall Green
B	it was taking me two hours to get to the other side of Birmingham
A	what side did you live then?
B	em Solihull
A	you live in Solihull and you had to get to Bournville?
B	yeah public transport
A	what time what route did you go?
B	I'd catch the thirty-seven down to Acocks Green
A	yeah
B	and then get the eleven around to the Bristol Road
A	yeah
B	and then get the eh sixty-two
A	yeah
B	down the Bristol Road which would have been fine if there hadn't been in traffic eh
A	were there teacher that worked lived near?
B	no
A	oh
B	it was such a shame but yeah I was spending four hours a day travelling
A	so how long were you at Bournville for?
B	eh four months
A	I bet you weren't upset when you didn't stay any longer
B	well it was my first placement
A	where have you been doing since then?
B	well that's the thing I deferred  I deferred  it in January because
A	was that with the university?
B	yeah
A	which Birmingham or?
B	yeah Birmingham
A	okay
B	Cos I put I've done the five five months the four months before Christmas
A	mm
B	literally every day all my waking hours was working and then at the weekend I'd be writing the research projects
A	mm hm
B	for the university so I had no free time to relax
A	mm
B	and I sustained that for four months and then I had the Christmas break and then I went back in January and I just couldn't concentrate and my brain just broke
A	mm
B	I'm gonna defer
A	but what what options have you got now?
B	well I'm looking into em publishing cos the English as a foreign language
A	yeah
B	there's such a big big market worldwide there's quite eh a few big publishing companies that em publish materials for
A	yeah
B	different markets within the English as a foreign language market
A	yeah
B	primary resources and that would seem natural for me to go into
A	oh yeah
B	for me to take advantage of the experience that I've got
A	yeah
B	in teaching English
A	yeah you've got to do something like that
B	mm hm
A	it's just unfortunate the job situation
B	exactly
A	but it's the same for everybody and I mean
B	mm
A	you know you need but I mean
B	mm
A	I mean
B	thank your lucky stars
A	well I'm lucky in one way it's no good
B	mm hm
A	so they'd live a long life but they're just living like morons
B	yeah
A	and yet some people don't live so long because they're taking risks
B	yeah
A	and doing this that and the other
B	mm hm
A	I'm not saying it's cramming so it's unbearable cos some people do have a life where they're doing a lot more
B	mm hm
A	and I'm not saying that they're going to die young but other people don't do anything
B	mm hm
A	and that's not a life is it?
B	yeah exactly
A	so so you know I mean
B	yeah
A	because at least you're aware of what's there
B	yeah
A	then you're aware you know some people are totally naive and didn't like
B	mm hm
A	you know and go through life and they think that everything is all just going to be alright it isn't
B	yeah
A	no
B	really?
A	well it's sad
B	mm
A	and some of these aging lads cos I said the culture and although women can do the job just as well as men in a lot ways that when you get a certain number of women together other things kick off
B	mm
A	but if you got women together they'll go to extremes to do something
B	mm hm
A	men will think oh no I don't  I don't  that's a good idea
B	mm
A	you know so em I worked there for a while
B	mm hm
A	but em mind you I've worked in all bloke environments
B	A bit smellier
A	well I it's I don't know I mean my I'll tell you something really weird at
B	it sounds quite
A	oh tell me about it
B	mm
A	and eh and if they don't like it they'll try and sort of some of the bully types will make some threats but with me it won't work because I'll just play the game and then if they start getting nasty I'll just I won't it's like what people do they just pretend nothing is there and I mean I've been threatened by her management
B	mm
B	why what was it that they didn't like that you were doing?
A	well I was union rep in two schools
B	oh really?
A	you know
B	mm
A	is somebody coming around it's like you know actually I mean I'm not a tough hard guy but if people start doing that I'll I'll I won't act hard to them but I won't back off
B	mm
A	so I know what I was saying  But eh because you can see that now with em well with this government really
B	yeah
A	and cos I'm I mean I'm I'm really left wing I am very
B	really?
A	they're alright
B	mm hm
A	but they're in a nice rich area
B	yeah
A	and I never talk politics with them
B	that's a good plan
A	and I go there the the rotor club they're all there you know
B	mm hm
A	and they're talking about scroungers and all that or whatever
B	mm hm
A	everywhere
B	exactly
A	I mean I go to  there's you don't see any ethnic minorities there
B	mm hm
A	you see big houses and they're nice people I mix with because that's the environment they live in
B	mm hm
A	but people might say well this that they might be but you know
B	yeah definitely
A	so I've got to play a game as well I play let's pretend just like everybody else
A	but em my brother is a
B	really?
A	yeah me brother ex-policeman what do you expect?
B	mm hm
A	eh my dad was a Tory
B	mm
A	because the they're
B	mm hm
A	but you can't tell him
B	yeah and they're all it all it is all they are already
A	they are already and
B	yeah
A	fifty percent
B	and it's quite interesting actually to see cos see normally in Spain people don't really challenge the establishment that much but the young generation nowadays they're really organising themselves
A	you know why don't you?
B	yeah
A	Cos Franco did so much
B	yeah
A	psychological damage to everybody
B	yeah
A	I mean even when he took power he's still killing people years and years and years afterwards with his cohorts
B	mm hm
A	I've heard stories of people hiding in buildings for ten fifteen years
B	yeah
A	you know and I mean something kicked up the other way we had some French lawyer who got in trouble over something
B	mm
A	went to North Africa where all the Spanish colonies were and brought all the Spanish soldiers that were in the colonies back to the mainland Spain and when
B	mm hm
A	and it was that that swung it otherwise and it was just the army he had at the time
B	mm
A	they'd have been overwhelmed but they got the actual forces back from North Africa
B	yeah
A	and that swung it and then
B	completely and the people still don't like talking about it
A	well they don't cos some of them are
B	it's like thirty thirty years later and it's still they just don't talk about it
A	because they were
B	mm hm
A	well it's like a lot of things just like all this abuse in the Catholic church and stuff
B	uh-huh
A	people are still getting you know
B	yeah
A	the one in Spain who's?
B	yeah
A	that's the one I was on about
B	oh right yeah cos he's trying to bring to justice a lot of the the war crimes they not even war crimes they were just crimes against humanity
A	I know
B	and Maggie Thatcher helped helped him escape
A	well I mean you know
B	mm hm
A	banks weren't allowed to do what they did and then Thatcher and Regan
B	they deregulated everything
A	and then eh Clinton didn't help signing some bill a as well but everything kicked off like
B	mm hm
A	because everybody should have a right to buy but the thing is council houses were built for people who couldn't afford
B	yeah
A	housing
B	yeah
A	and eh it's obvious the when you look at the the different amounts of money people earn some people like
B	mm hm
A	and look at their economy they haven't got a problem with it
B	mm
A	I mean I didn't buy that house next door till when I was twenty-
B	mm hm
A	guess how much I paid for it?
B	eh in nineteen eighty-one gosh thirty thousand? Forty thousand? More or less?
A	fourteen
B	fourteen thousand? Blimey
A	eh I've got me payslips from when I em when I started teaching
B	mm
A	A hell of a lot of money and eh
B	mm
A	but I didn't buy it to make money cos I've lived I I mean people say oh how much is this? But I didn't buy it to make money
B	mm
A	Cos I haven't sold it
B	mm
A	and then you think why keep it up to date immaculately? It's like you know
B	yeah exactly it needs to be your home your castle
A	you know it's just when someone else sees what?
B	mm
A	which is good really
B	yeah
A	I don't know I mean I was never promoted
B	mm hm
A	and I mean I didn't learn to drive till I was thirty
B	I'm learning how to drive right now
A	and eh I still got me bus I go to town I don't drive there
B	mm
A	I pay fifty-five quid a month and I can drive on any not I can
B	mm hm
A	so but I don't like
B	mm hm
A	and I don't like that
B	mm
A	I just like a nice easy I said to
B	I agree with you
A	peace and quiet that's all I want
B	yeah
A	if you're not looking for things they'll come along anyway
B	mm hm
A	because they do
B	Strange that you
A	well I know I'll tell you how it started
B	mm hm
A	A nice little country village
B	oh okay
A	so I had all these psychos
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh blimey cos nowadays you have spend a whole day in the school and they grill you you have to do a
A	it depends on what they want though because
B	an observed lesson and
A	but I never had any trouble with the kids because basically I was
B	mm hm
A	but I wouldn't take any crap
B	you wouldn't be able to get away with that nowadays would you? The kids have got so many
A	well I sorted one kid out when I was at
B	mm hm
A	and I had a laugh and I didn't grass them up or anything and I
A	and he  And he  stayed over a pub in Aston and he went alright sir we think you're really alright
B	mm hm
A	and I sat down and then they will have a chat with me
B	mm
A	I but I don't know I think it depends with what kids you deal with
B	yeah true
A	but the thing is I've em kids are more violent now not less violent
B	mm
A	when there's no discipline
B	mm hm
A	there's more and I'm not just saying weapon I'm saying beating up gangs and everything
B	yeah
A	and kids respect knowing where they stand
B	mm
A	and eh they'll
B	yeah
A	the kids will do that with a story where you push somebody you know as if threw them out a window or whatever so you don't have to do anything
B	mm
A	it's like when you talk to somebody some kids will react to
B	mm
A	because it's the way  the way  you say it and who you are
B	yeah
A	and you can't I mean you know but then also at the end of the day if I do things wrong then I'll say I'll face the music
B	mm hm
A	but if you're a valuable asset to the school and you don't have trouble or anything and you don't
B	yeah yeah they're gonna want to keep you
A	you know
B	especially nowadays with the
A	the only time when I was away was the last year I was away a bit
B	mm hm
A	I was never away and I did my first year of over
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	and I did it all like it was a little play and it was lovely
B	mm hm
A	because they do that with each other
B	mm hm
A	so you're just doing what they do so they know exactly what they sort of
B	it's like
A	so you've got to be careful you don't
B	but it surprised me the amount of kids that just don't care
A	well the thing is like in a way
B	mm
A	in their whole life if that's gonna be what their life's like that means they're never going to have a situation they're going to have a situation in respect or intimacy
B	yeah
A	or being able to relate to people in a sensible
