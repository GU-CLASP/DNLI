G	yeah that's what that's the bit I haven't done
E	the what?
C	because I think
E	CVs aren't even hard they're like the easiest things ever
A	I think it's really difficult to sell yourself that's the one thing I find difficult about CVs and personal statements is trying to sell yourself
E	oh you're so cute
C	I put if you just bullshit though
A	without sounding pretentious I think it's hard to get me personally I think it's hard to get that balance because I'm either like really pretentious or just not saying anything good about myself
C	well I just
G	I could do alternatively I could do it properly
C	you'll still get the same amount of jobs
G	none
C	well yeah I mean once the CV's finished
G	can't write it when
C	is it true that they did all the filming with the kids in one go so that they didn't age?

G	and they still thought it was
H	yeah the kids just sit there don't they? you can do a voice-over
F	no they
C	no but like
I	mm they're talking
G	maybe they did more than one ending and hadn't decided yet which one to use

F	and erm the blonde one's called
G	I feel so left out about the smoking
F	don't it's a good thing
G	but there's so much social
F	yeah but
F	I would love I'd actually happily trade in one of my lungs to like not want to smoke any more cos then at least I'd have one healthy functioning lung rather than two shit ones
G	why don't you just stop?
F	erm well I tried I quit for like three weeks at the beginning of summer when I was ill and then two weeks half way through summer when I was ill and then two weeks before I came home but then
G	really?
F	yeah
G	tried about three times choked on my own lung every time and I just like why? why? why? it's expensive and it hurts
F	yeah no literally no point to it and you stink and you get yellow teeth and your clothes smell and I just
G	does
F	erm
G	is that after a meal?
F	er no usually before he goes to bed
G	mm
F	like to end the day a reward for not smoking all day is a cigarette at the end of the day
F	and he's actually doing really well as well I feel really guilty because I was the one originally who from one day to the next I was like we should just try to stop smoking together it'll be easier the two of us and then he was really good and stuck to it and I was the one having massive cravings I was like
G	mm
F	getting quite competitive though
G	yeah I really
F	don't wanna start insulting people and getting really angry
G	I really don't wanna go with
G	I really don't
F	why?
G	cos he's so he'll er he's really er he's so he knows everything so if you say like I'll say a country
F	it's like this is the president it's like what?
F	feel bad
G	why?
G	ah don't feel guilty I'm sure if he was in the same situation he'd do the same thing
F	yeah
F	and it's like
F	I love animals
G	that's so much

F	erm it's what put me off doing sciences cos originally I wanted to go into medicine but in France you have to erm like when you get to your A levels you have to specialise like I was telling you earlier so I went into like economics and then there's a literature section and a science section but it kind of put me off going through there because obviously you learn everything in detail in French and I there's still stuff today that I have no idea what it is in English like words I've never had to use
G	yeah
F	but
G	I really wanna hear you speak French can you speak French?
F	no I hate it when people put me on the spot no

F	my timing is very bad
E	I know he's doing
F	it's very smart though
E	see
F	ah
E	in that jumper
F	he was nibbling my finger last night I put it in the cage to stroke him he proper came up and he was like nibble nibble nibble
C	fucking
A	my work here is done
unknown_female	good girl
E	oh where am I? I'm not on your friends
E	oh I'm
F	yeah
F	he was just going mental a second ago he was like
unknown_female	hello
unknown_female	ah hi
E	oh look how cute he is
F	I love it when he gets all fat and like rests his head and like his cheeks are going
E	ah he's so cute
F	no you may not
G	can you hold him still?
F	he hasn't even shit on you yet
C	what on your
E	cos he doesn't like you
G	can you hold him still so I can touch him without moving? cos the movement is what I don't like
unknown_female	ah
F	be very gentle
G	yeah
F	ah these are cool all up my arm and come to my face
unknown_female	ah
F	my face
unknown_female	how do you take it out?
B	think he just pissed on me
F	ah
G	well
B	think about
unknown_female	I'm not surprised I am surprised
G	how did you get them put in?
B	er it's kinda minging they do like a hole punch thing and take a like a cylinder of skin
C	I'm not taking responsibility if it jumps on me
G	ah cool
unknown_female	sounds lovely
F	sounds terrible
E	that's nice
F	I think someone's excited cos their
A	she
F	she
A	yes
F	nearly shut the gate on his face
G	in five minutes he's gonna finish his thing then come down five minutes for him is probably like fifteen so we can start without him
F	looking for? don't no don't come under it come out out
G	vagina
A	I had vagina wine the wine is in my vagina
F	there you go
C	oh
A	what from my vagina?
G	wouldn't be the first time
G	uhu
A	so when is
G	five ten minutes I don't know it's still still that amount of time
A	oh that that amount of time
G	yep
G	why do you do this thing? why not the thumb?
A	it's registered to you these fingers so I can do it with any of these
F	that is cool
G	I'm impressed by that
unknown_female	what?
G	you know that's great that is great cos if you're in a massive fire and you burn one hand you can still sign in with the other hand
F	yeah? wow
unknown_female	don't really know what I
G	I wouldn't want to lock my phone to a finger print cos what happened if you had an accident and then
A	well then you can I've got a passcode as well
G	oh
C	so what is it exactly the same as like the IOS eight are different is it?
A	I haven't downloaded the IOS eight
F	I would drop the
C	so it doesn't come with the Iphone six doesn't come with IOS eight?
A	no no it does but erm because like I got the same
F	you bought the phone outright?
A	six hundred and nineteen pounds
F	mm
C	well not the insurance though yeah
F	wait you had a
A	yeah
C	yeah cos when she lost her phone they claimed off the insurance and they did not have the Iphone five in their database for some strange reason
A	well they no the Apple store don't sell Iphones by sixty-four gigabytes any more
C	so they did the they priced it off as Iphone six
A	so they could only give me one better like they could only either offer you the same one or a better one they can't give you anything less so like it was a basic look that I lost my phone when I well my phone was taken when it was and then I
F	it's pretty fucking
C	cos I I
G	that's shit
F	do you want it? shall I give it back?
F	you
G	I'm kinda scared of the size of it though is it the one that bends or is it the plus?
C	no the plus bends
A	but it's like to be fair if you're gonna apply force to anything it's gonna break no because
C	no no no I'm not being funny though like no that doesn't bend
G	also it depends how much force you put the amount of force it will be put by putting it in your pocket then it's too much
A	oh no no it's this one isn't the bending by the pocket because that's when you're like sitting on your phone sitting on your phone sitting on your phone like I watched a video of a man just like constantly sitting like doing squats onto a seat for like twenty-four hours and it didn't bend
F	that must have been a waste of time
G	you imagine how much that fucking bum would hurt also wouldn't it have
A	did it I think he did it in skinny jeans
G	ah
A	and he had the chunkiest
F	chunky
C	chunky
G	so he could have done with the exercise then at least he did it in in a
A	mm milky
G	used his obesity
A	oh you gonna get some wine?
C	keeping moaning harping on about how you don't have wine you're so
unknown_female	then that's what you should do
F	you're free to walk in at will
B	like the three people lived here last year were like
B	I know
B	yeah but like now that they've already done it we were saying that if they are passing by we do have music on then we'll just
B	it's put us in the shit basically for like he could have just like messaged us but like my old flatmate made us go round and apologise and I had to
G	had you been in here before then? before like as in last year?
B	he hadn't lived here but there's two there's one
C	fuck off you do not look like Vanessa Williams
A	no no
A	but it's
G	yeah but
G	yeah
B	like just message us
G	or go round it's not that much effort
B	mm
C	but at the end of the day like what's the worst that could happen? they would have went round they would have went round they would have went listen
B	yeah
C	they would have got a torrent of abuse then they ring the police you know that's the worse case scenario
B	I know
C	you know it wouldn't have killed them to come round and just been like listen turn the music down
B	exactly apparently
C	mm
B	and he obviously like he like he
A	Michelle Williams that's who I look like
B	but yeah she
B	has
G	not too sure
A	erm next door?
B	I
F	I see it more in that
B	oh her room?
A	I've just seen you
B	maybe you know
A	say something I'm giving a record shut the fuck up
B	is that the new Iphone six?
A	yeah
B	can I please hold it?
B	is it bendable or not?
C	don't don't try bending it
A	ah it's just
B	okay
A	apparently I look like her
B	it's not bendable that
A	it's new today it is about seven hours old
B	oh is it? oh I really like it
G	you've got you've got insurance for it right?
A	no not yet
B	oh it's so big to hold isn't it?
A	I know
A	put it to your face though cos it's
B	how many apps have you got?
A	no erm
B	oh is it the same as before?
A	yeah yeah that's the er erm thingy from thingy
B	oh I really like it oh I'm so jealous
F	get it
G	as if you're phoning someone
F	yeah no one walks around like that
G	my god it's like a tablet
unknown_female	I can't
B	I was thinking I might just like pretend the Ipad's one and be like
B	so did you just get an upgrade or did you pay?
A	no erm my phone got stolen
C	who would have thought that would be a good thing?
A	I know my phone got stolen er last week I had the er Iphone five S sixty-four gig
B	yeah
A	but I had insurance on it erm but the Apple store don't sell Iphone six sixty-four gigabytes so they had to offer me something better so I got the like the upgrade anyway to the Iphone six
B	so how much you like how much is it if you just bought it?
A	six hundred and nineteen pounds
C	I'm not being funny I wouldn't have even bothered I would have just bought that
G	it's not six hundred additional quid though it's
A	yeah
C	no no you know
G	yeah that's not mine mine's
A	yeah no I wasn't
C	yeah I know but there's so many things that you copy that to like literally so many things
A	I know I've got like three copies of it but I still don't
C	mm
A	erm but no because my contract runs out next year so when my contract runs out next year I'll be
F	why do you care so much about the stuff that's on it? why don't you just delete it and have it over with?
C	no no no no it's not
A	it's for legal reasons
C	it like yeah she's just got like loads of evidence type thing against her ex on it so she's gotta keep ahold of it just in case like it's like
A	it's it's like
C	it's a one in a million chance that anything would need to come from it but it's just
A	oh my god
A	but yeah no I I can't delete everything on that cos then I've lost all my evidence and I won't
B	so have you got all that back now on on that phone?
C	no that wasn't the phone that wasn't the phone that was stolen she had a different sort of
B	so have you got the
A	no
B	no
A	no they've
C	she had she had the Iphone five
B	right
C	that was the one that was stolen and then the Iphone four
B	so how did you get stuff back?
A	erm because I had I backed it up with
C	with an Ipad
A	yeah
B	right okay I'm with you now
A	erm like I I backed it up erm after I came back from erm my like my travelling trip
B	yeah
A	to have like cos I wouldn't have even bothered it's just like all of the photos and like
B	yeah
A	like delete three thousand photos I'd have been fucking devastated if I'd have lost that
B	yeah
A	but yeah or like everything is backed up erm since like August so that's just like erm got that phone like
B	so have you got things that you can use against him if something like kicked off? is that what you mean?
B	like your ex I'm on about
A	yeah yeah no like erm but yeah
B	what did you say?
A	her
B	her I thought you were going who I was like her?
A	no like yeah I have all of the stuff that would like basically either get a erm it was so bad that I could get a what the fuck are they called? a restraining order
C	it wasn't a restraining order it was a fucking injunction that was it
A	yeah but I could get either depending on how far I wanted to push it
C	er yeah I I don't I
A	but like the yeah there was you know there would have been several but I could get an injunction then
B	so they're just like messages off her to you
C	an injunction is basically exactly the same as a restraining order it's just if you break an injunction there's not as many
A	like repercussions
C	yeah
B	ah okay
C	basically if you break an injunction then you get a slap on the wrist
A	yeah
C	if you break it more than once then jail time may occur whereas er restraining order if you break one then you're fucked
A	yeah erm
C	so
B	so is is she
A	don't worry about it
B	she messaged you is that why?
A	yeah like I've got like shit loads of messages and erm like just all sorts of like
B	really? oh
A	yeah
B	so that stuff that you need on like
A	yeah so that's why I wouldn't wanna keep that phone like to use just because if it did get taken then like although I do have like three extra backups of it
B	yeah
A	like one of them is untouchable cos it's on her external hard drive
B	yeah
A	erm
A	I wouldn't wanna lose it just in case
C	I'm reporting
A	you're reporting
B	so are you gonna take that phone out with you and stuff or is that just gonna be your phone where you keep?
A	no no that's just the phone that I'll keep like in case
G	she's had that she's had that around the flat the whole year it's just the phone that she's used a couple of times
B	yeah right okay that makes sense now I understand

I	no honestly
G	no if you had the
I	I'm saying if you take out a four S contract as soon as it came out by the time you got to upgrade you wouldn't be a five you get it'll be a six that's how often they come out but it's not true because obviously I upgraded it in December
I	why?
G	dunno
I	I hated Iphones they drove me absolutely insane I
G	mine does that
I	it's cos the battery the lithium ion batteries have only got
G	what's that?
I	about phones you'll never need to charge them again cos all around cities and they'll have wifi charges so if you connect to wifi it'll charge your phone as well how weird is that? you'll never have to charge your phone again your wifi'll be able to do it how could wifi do that? charging is about pumping electrons back how can wifi do that?
G	that's scary
I	yeah exactly
G	does that not mean it's in the connection? how can it that's weird that's physical isn't it? that's why you have to
I	you need physical electrons to go right into the battery yeah

I	you can have physical electricity moving around in the air that's beta that's beta radiation isn't it?
G	yeah but that
I	just I saw it was on the news it wasn't like a thing I read on the internet it was on the news it's blatantly happening it's really weird
G	it won't accept

C	hi yeah sorry I've just erm ordered a pizza that I've just got a phone call back yeah saying that the price has increased I just want a breakdown of the prices considering they said that erm the price has increased by three pound for a garlic bread that means it was five pound for cheesy chips I'm a bit confused
