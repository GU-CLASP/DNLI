E	this is nothing to do with me I
A	has somebody already
E	somebody hasn't logged off last time
A	ooh that'll be Tess
C	my next favourite place is probably Italy
A	yeah I like Italy
C	mostly because the food does agree with me there and the cos as a vegetarian you can eat what you like basically
A	I've been to Italy once
C	just generally means flying though
A	where do you  Where do you  come from?
C	we might
A	oh no we have been
C	nearest I've been to is probably Cyprus

C	ah right okay
A	yeah no it's yeah
C	Good lord
A	I've been what?
C	I said you could only be about twelve
A	give over
E	oh you have to switch on again
C	did it rain?
E	no it was beautiful weather
A	just in case you get a dry throat
C	that's to go with your gin later on
E	he's cheeky
C	where would you like to go?
E	where would you like to go?
C	money no object
E	oh I don't know
A	if you were going to have
E	oh I don't know

E	yeah I know
C	bit Spanish
A	very Spanish
E	yeah I know  I know  it was very nice
C	there are other places you know?
E	oh yes yes
A	so whereabouts though where would you go then? Or does it matter what? Is it just what you see?
E	em
A	Northumberland? Yeah
E	but I mean as I said we haven't decided on anything yet
A	and walking and that you'd get some walking done
E	and walking a bit just a bit
A	of course it does
E	and I think it'll be a case of planning something at the last minute
A	yeah I never when I get when I go back into the office I am going to have a look to see what if there's any like walks to do on Sunday this Sunday
E	so where are you going to be this Sunday?
A	no nowhere
E	I know yeah
A	I don't mean anything too heavy
E	yes
A	but then it depends cos it just like you say it depends on the weather
E	it depends on the weather as to where you go really
A	I'm just wondering  I'm just wondering  if by Saturday if I'm up in the clouds in my helicopter I'll be able to see see far afield and see if there's any snow in different areas
E	yes of course
A	I'll be
C	mrs
E	A bindery okay doke
A	yeah just talking about walking and places to walk you know
C	do you do walking?
A	A bit
C	to the pub and back
C	I remember you telling me about it
C	oh right yeah
A	that's what it's called
C	there's two excellent pubs in that part of the world too
A	well we down at the bottom there was I don't know whether it's called the there's a tiny one em
C	yeah I think that's the one we've we've stayed at
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	or whichever one it was
A	yeah
C	hello there what can we do for you?
A	walking walking in the Lakes
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	but we're going up again we're going up on the
C	same place?
A	twentieth
C	oh right the roller
A	on the twentieth
C	superb pub at the bottom
A	A what?
C	superb pub at the bottom
A	right another pub
C	yeah and and then a little railway line that winds its way up into the hills it's lovely
A	tell me what these
C	the the one at
A	they're called the Boot and the
C	the the one actually at Ravenglass is the Ratty or something like that
A	is that  Is that Is that  dead obvious where the
C	oh you can't miss is you can't
A	it's very small isn't that
C	it's kind of its stuck on its own and you can't possibly miss is because it's right by the side of the the proper railway right? And then you have to walk a little way up to the the
A	boot?
C	is the name of the village
A	oh right yeah okay
C	and there's three pubs there all of which are excellent
A	right
C	I've been to all three of them
A	right
C	tested and
A	excellent
C	blimey
A	no it's a cheap one give over
C	yeah cos normally you only do one night
A	only
C	ah I see
A	and the
C	that's not bad at all
A	not bad at all
C	I know one place cheaper than that and that's only because I get discount being a
A	yeah?
C	but you get a discount there for your  But that brings the price down for a double room bed and breakfast thirty-six quid
A	for two of you?
C	what? That's it's room price
A	yeah that's very good
C	so
A	is it a long way to it to walk?
C	what
A	could you walk to it
C	eh I I
C	investigate
A	you know what I mean? Yeah
C	Cos I can't remember what the distance is between the two
A	Arnside
C	right but Ravenglass if further round the side
A	yeah cos it would be nice just to have a really good just a good day out you know be it part walking drive maybe I bet we have to drive I don't know but
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	and it's it's worth having a look at places like
A	ah
C	again
A	yeah it's a case of looking at maps
C	well your nearest public library has got all those
A	oh
C	where do you live?
C	hi there what can we do for you?
E	ah yes yes
C	we were talking about walking in the Dales
E	we were talking yeah walking walking somewhere

E	and
C	from the car to the pub
E	no
C	she is
E	so she can see what's nice and where what isn't covered in snow
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	I am indeed

E	yeah I know yeah
C	that'll be good
E	yes
C	well I
E	yeah no I agree
C	so if you go to France and Germany and Austria and places like that like and you say sorry I don't eat meat and they look at you like you've got a third arm
E	yes
C	you don't what? You don't eat meat? Is there something wrong with you
E	you don't eat meat
C	it is well there's no  there's no  em there's no big deal about not eating meat there
E	yeah I suppose it is really yeah
C	especially Switzerland where they charge you an arm and a leg
E	oh Switzerland is mega expensive yes yeah
C	it's a real rip off and they take the money off you left right and centre and you don't get very much in return from what I've found in eh in Switzerland so
E	well it's always they're always a bit grumpy as well there as well I find
C	Grumpy
E	that's what I've noticed
C	probably cos you weren't spending money at the time
E	yeah that's it
C	it's not the point
E	that'll explain why they were grumpy with me
E	no I didn't
C	no please please they've had them at least since the late nineteen sixties
E	well when we first got married we didn't have a credit card
C	nothing to do and no money to spend
E	nowhere nothing to do no money to spend it yes yeah
C	ooh that's a drag
E	and hungry as well
