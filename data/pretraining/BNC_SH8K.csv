A	well that's not quite how it works but
C	it's not racist
B	saying they sit around in the sun all day
C	well no but every time you look at them you know there's there's big unemployment and people just don't wanna work
B	I don't know if that's true they I think they'd be happy to work if there's jobs wouldn't they?
C	well I dunno
B	don't think its
C	I'd have to read up on it to really know if I wanted to stay in or not
B	as well there's less I think since they had the Euro as well it's not done them any favours because it's their currency used to be it sort of things used to be a lot cheaper over there so they get loads of tourists and there's a lot less tourists going so
