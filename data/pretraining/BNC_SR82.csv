D	well not just Eastern European any country
B	yeah like

C	yeah
A	a lot of them though
B	yeah a lot of them it's like
A	like
B	they just go and live somewhere where a lot of their people live and I think that's really rude because it's like
C	mm
B	well you're living in England why not live and work with English people why do you have to go and live in a society where it's like you're at home again?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	yeah

C	I don't really like fish like yeah fish was a better example
C	yeah exactly
B	or there's a section of society that are allergic
C	especially subway which is such like a large franchise that like obviously in America and everything it's not gonna change so why are they trying to change it here?
B	it really pisses me off

C	I know I
C	I know
C	but erm
B	yeah
C	about Cheryl Cole and
B	yeah
C	sticking up for him I get that like cos my manager if I did something wrong she would totally stick up for me

B	like
C	er I was like can you just put us onto a manager please I don't wanna cause a fuss
B	yeah
C	yeah and then erm
B	yeah
A	you think that they'd go completely out of their way to be like their customer's always right
C	yeah
A	and customer service
B	because
C	I know from like
B	you've gotta use your common sense haven't you though a lot of the time with it
C	yeah
B	I know it's fucking a
C	like

C	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	like
A	like have a
B	but
A	little bit test it whatever but like don't the important thing
C	but you table check them as well and then you're like is everything alright with your meal and they go yeah

A	cos you didn't pray
C	yeah
B	like my
A	thanks
B	like
C	yeah
B	he comes to our country why can't everyone be as accepting and as tolerant as him
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and it really pisses me off when people say oh all Muslims are knobheads or this or that because they're not
A	I know
C	yeah yeah I know yeah
B	I've got so many Muslim friends who are really nice people
A	it's one thing that really irritates me about my mum like don't get me wrong she is not racist at all she has just been brought up with that frame of mind
C	she just doesn't really get it uhu
A	and she doesn't get it and like she used to be erm a med sec so she would deal with all the calls and they would always be foreigners and
C	yeah
A	she would always get shit from them
D	that side of them yeah
C	yeah
B	she expects
A	she yeah
C	it's really easy to be like yeah
A	and it
C	do you want that put one of them coats on?
A	really annoys me
C	are you sure?
A	yeah thank you though
B	but yeah I can understand why people like
A	yeah exactly
C	like our grandparents are really like that
D	like
B	yeah
C	yeah like mindset as well
B	yeah
A	it's just really ignorant
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	they're so ignorant
A	in a world like ours where every like countries' doors are open and there is a lot of diversity it's just ignorant to be racist I think
C	yeah
B	like UKIP them two guys we went to a Chinese restaurant the other week and erm
A	he actually made the noise though he actually went mm
B	he went
B	he obviously expects us to be at home in the kitchen or something
A	he didn't have a problem going and eating at a Chinese restaurant
B	yeah
A	though
B	but he must've known like he
A	yeah
B	and they're like oh they're foreign
C	yeah
B	and he just assumed that we were foreign and that we were dickheads so he were like sniffing and walking past us like you fucking bigot
A	yeah
D	oh my god
B	and I'm just like people like that seriously don't deserve to live in England like
C	yeah
B	even
A	I know
D	I noticed like a lot of people who
C	yeah they don't really get it like
B	yeah
C	all of
D	they're all idiots
C	they're all like proper Geordie lads and like they're really stupid when they're talking cos they don't know anything about it and it really annoys us it's like
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	and they're like they're really lovely lads but when they start talking it's just like
B	yeah
C	you don't even know enough about it to like
D	yeah
B	yeah I used to be like that
C	yeah in my school like there was no like there was no like there was no foreign people at all
B	no
C	it wasn't
B	and I and I didn't know anything about them I just had this
D	yeah
B	thing in my head that they were all idiots blah blah and
C	like unis are like more diverse than schools
A	yeah
D	so much
A	yeah
B	but like you like if you don't go to school or you don't go to work or you don't get education like you will always think
C	have that mindset uhu
B	yeah you'll always be that ignorant and intolerable
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	because you don't have
D	opens your mind so much more
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I was actually saying to my dad earlier it's funny cos we were talking about the exact same thing and we walking down a road and I heard literally about three different languages and I just said to him like I love living in a place where you can walk down the street and hear five different languages in one go
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	I love that I think we're so lucky to live in such a diverse country
B	so diverse
C	yeah
A	like people don't realise but
B	yeah
D	yeah that's the thing
C	but I think uni's like that with like proper opened my eyes to like drugs and stuff cos I'd never ever been around like anything like that in school like none of my friends or anything
B	yeah
C	loads more
D	yeah
C	of it
B	your eyes are opened up though aren't they to like everything and
D	they're more accepting as well like
B	I think we're really though as women
A	yeah
B	to be able to come to university and get these experiences because in a lot of countries women don't have that privilege
D	yeah exactly yeah
A	yeah
D	and that's what really annoys me when people like oh feminism oh
C	you should see my seminar group like we're doing twentieth century women
unknown_female	mm
C	like they're so like
B	I mean there's
C	yeah like some of them are really like
B	just like
D	yeah but a lot of people
A	they're just as bad as the men that don't accept women when women don't accept men it's like they're giving feminists a bad name
B	yeah
C	yeah exactly
D	but
A	yeah
C	yeah and like
A	that's why erm did you see
D	yeah I saw it yeah yeah
A	that's why I loved it because she
C	yeah
A	actually said in such simple terms that
B	feminism
A	fe-bu-bu-buth
A	erm isn't a bad thing it's just been given a bad name by the few people who just take it too far
C	yeah yeah exactly
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	them girls in my seminar there's like a group of them like honestly they're like she read this book and it was about like obviously like
B	yeah
C	and then they're like she's like it just makes me so mad and this American girl and I was like
B	yeah
C	we're in we're in a seminar anyway like
B	yeah
C	you're not really gonna be doing
B	I mean
A	no
B	I mean there are there are still like inequalities between women and men
C	yeah
B	no women used to be able to vote and now they can we've got
D	thing is though like
B	I mean there is still inequalities like I say like wage inequality stuff like that
D	yeah I know what you mean
B	for more rights but
D	but not just that but like it's bigger than just our country people say it's not a problem any more but you go to India
B	no
D	like one of
B	so fucking rude innit?

D	I mean obviously Middle Eastern countries as well
B	I'm sorry but men would not be alive if it weren't for women
D	well yeah exactly
B	like and men would and women wouldn't be alive if it weren't for men
D	yeah exactly
B	you can't get pregnant on your own but like the
C	but then they get like maternity leave and stuff now women and men only get like don't they get like two months or something
B	they get two weeks
C	well
B	but like
C	yeah
B	what they get
D	it's paternity leave isn't it yeah?
C	yeah
B	but like
D	but I think women should get more
C	I think they should
D	to be honest because
C	but then
B	cos like you carry a child for nine months you get another
D	yeah
B	you get nine months'
B	maternity leave don't you? like if I when I'm working if I have a kid I'm gonna work until I drop
C	yeah
B	have a maternity leave then so I can spend it with the baby
