B	so I was at boarding school he was there in the sixties he was sort of everywhere in the sixties but erm he was first stationed up there in the sixties
A	yeah
B	yeah that's right so I was born in nineteen seventy-three and then he was back again
A	yeah
B	being a commanding officer of a barracks
A	right
B	which was really boring
A	yeah
B	it was in
A	mm
B	and it was boring because all he had to do was just basically these young cadets would come in train them up basic training
A	yeah
B	pump them out you know it was just like that and and nothing interesting and erm but er so we went out to
A	yes
B	like a big barracks you know with all sorts of things go on erm I got I got kind of bored so I went up to the dude who trained the dogs
A	mm
B	the the guard dogs and all the erm sort of dog kind of tactics they do to get a man down
A	yeah
B	so I said oh I like the look of that and he goes well do you wanna go into one of the suits and see what it feels like? so the big big kid of suits right
A	yeah yeah
B	but they're for blokes not for kids so anyway I got into this thing and it wasn't quite fitting right and he goes right run
A	yeah?
B	but didn't go for me after that was really well
A	no no just
B	trained
A	yeah
B	just kind of waited and watched
A	yeah they're they're brilliant though
B	just see what happened so er anyway and then I said to him I'm a bit bored and he goes oh you like dogs? I went yeah I like dogs he goes okay come over here so he showed us the er compound they have for dogs
A	yeah
B	that erm I suppose you know they just do sort of erm what would they do? erm sniffing for bombs or something
A	mm
B	you know they've got to
A	mm
B	do that sort of thing?
A	you
B	so they'd kind of like an assault course for dogs
A	yeah yeah
B	you know like they have to
A	yeah yes
B	run up things
A	I I remember I
B	and
A	I I used to
B	down things
A	we used to cut them and erm
B	jumping through
A	yeah no I mean I we used to do the dog compound when I
B	mm
A	and we we used to hate doing the dog compound you know you'd be on a on a triple I mean the that's the thing with the er cylinder on each side like that and one underneath and you're on this thing and when you've turned a corner cos the wheels on the back can turn really sharply you can get right close to
B	yeah
A	trees and you'd spin round like that and maybe the outward cylinder would hit hit a pile of dog shit
B	oh no
A	and you'd go like and it would go
B	oh
A	it would sometimes
B	no
A	it would hit you
B	that's
A	you know?
B	just horrible
A	and we used to hate doing the dog compound
B	oh no
A	used to hate it
A	they were supposed to clear it
B	right
A	you know they'd
B	oh
A	we'd say we're coming today okay we're clearing it come in come in half an hour and it'll be
B	yeah
A	clear but they always used to leave some oh it was horrible
B	mm
A	it's like strimming erm we used to have to strim in these bomb dumps you know?
B	yeah
A	and you had to strim the banks of
B	oh I know what you mean
A	those bunkers you know?
B	yeah yeah the yeah
A	and the
B	you'd have to go down there
A	and the in the in the
B	yeah
A	time of the year when the the little baby frogs were in there you know
B	oh
A	you got covered in frogs
B	no oh you
A	it was horrible
B	we're about to have our dinner I can't believe you're
A	yeah a
B	oh god please
B	and then and it so anyway he said erm do you er erm yeah you can't train the dogs for the for the proper dogs but we've got this one dog that we thought was gonna be a a goer but it turned about to be a bit
A	yeah
B	is what I understand and he's going well erm we're kind of probably going to get rid of it and I went oh no can I see if I can train it up? and they were like so they knew I was gonna be going back to school in a few weeks
A	yeah
B	and they knew that they said yeah you know like whatever go on see what you can do kind of thing
A	yeah
B	and I had no idea what to do with training dogs
A	yeah
B	I hadn't got a clue I'd never owned my own dog I was only fourteen
A	yeah
B	so anyway I was training this dog and like every day every day every day every day every day every day and of course it was a complete disaster at the beginning
A	mm
B	the dog wouldn't do anything and erm towards the end the bloke came along once and he said
A	yeah
B	really? and he was like yeah you've managed to actually get it to do something that I couldn't get it to do
A	yeah
B	but it's still quite limited what it's gonna be able to do
A	yeah
B	but you've
A	mm
A	and what did they do in the end?
B	chuffed er
A	did they keep it?
B	I got it to I got it to go up down a plank
A	yeah
B	and jump
A	yeah
B	that was about all I could get it to do but erm no they weren't gonna keep it they weren't gonna keep it
A	what do they do? do they shoot them or they?

A	aren't they lovely? mm
B	they're lovely
A	is this still on?
B	yeah I've never heard so much coming from knowing people's relationships you know?
A	mm
B	I mean things like
A	what here?
B	maybe cos I'm talking to people older than me that more things have
A	yeah
B	happened in life
A	mm yeah
B	but the things that have happened are like quite like
A	mm
B	full on things
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	well I've had three wives
B	you have
B	you've done well
B	well that's sad
A	two two died when both of them were forty-two
B	yeah that's really freaky
A	it's a good job
B	mm true and
A	and the first one I only found out by surfing the net
B	yeah
A	I found out she'd died but she'd
B	mm
A	and not long after
B	oh god
A	she was in an MGB on the A1 A1 road which wasn't I think it was one of those three lane roads thing you know those
B	mm
A	dangerous roads?
B	mm
A	they had a head on collision
B	really?
A	he was obviously pissed
B	oh he was trying to blame it on
A	and tried to blame it on her
B	his girlfriend
A	cos he thought she was dead
B	how nice
A	mm lovely girl
B	oh so she lived?
A	oh she lived
B	oh right
A	oh yeah she lived from that oh yeah but her eyes were
B	yeah
A	and I dunno what the result cos she was such a pretty girl really was a pretty she was a model really too and they used to she used to work for ICI and the photo club there used her as a model you know
B	mm
A	mainly for her face and
B	mm
A	from East Anglia
B	mm
A	and she was buried in
A	and er and
B	mm
A	he had his own business I would reckon she died from er the aftermaths of the accident
B	yeah
A	I would imagine she had terrible brain damage
B	how long after the accident did she die?
A	oh it was quite long she was
B	mm
A	look at that mushroom it's incredible
B	mm
A	well
B	it's hard to say
A	I'm not saying it is she could have had cancer
B	no hard to say
A	she might have had it you know it could have died of anything or
B	did you go to her funeral?
A	no I didn't no I only found this
B	oh
A	I've went and found this by digging on the
B	you know it must be such a weird thing actually being once being married to someone and then not being married to them anymore
A	mm well it is odd
B	it must be like you kind of your right arm or your left arm kind of cut off
A	well when when
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	I knew her when she was twenty-one
B	mm
A	and I was twenty-three four
B	mm
A	er twenty-four I suppose
B	mm
A	she was
B	well yeah
A	a terrific loss
B	well how do you
A	she
B	get over it?
A	well I don't know if I ever did really I mean it's like you say it's like
B	do you still think about her a lot?
A	mm
B	do you?
A	mm
B	I don't think about my mum at all much
A	no
B	what that means
A	no well no no because well I think with your mother it it's a natural progression it's a natural thing isn't it? you know? your mum dies before you hopefully
B	mm that's true
A	and you then and and it's a
B	mm
A	yeah people are
B	but some people really go on about their grief and they go oh not a day goes past that I don't think about
A	yeah but
B	you know and I'm like
A	yes but who who yeah but
B	I can't believe there's such a
A	you weren't living with her you see
B	no no I wasn't
A	I mean that it's different I
B	yeah
A	I mean I was living with them all you you know
B	mm
A	we were there all the time together
B	mm
A	and you know it's different if you were living at home with your mother
B	oh you'd miss her
A	you would
B	I mean I miss her anyway
A	how old was she when she died?
A	yeah that's not old is it?
B	not really
A	and it's like I was saying today there's got
B	that's nothing
A	at all
B	that's nothing yeah
A	I mean if you look at my father
B	and her own mother
A	he's ninety-one
B	that's right
A	and
B	that's right and her own mother died of a disease but at least she was eighty-three or eighty-four
A	mm
B	so mum lost out totally
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and she
B	but you know what they say?
A	making making the bed out went like that
B	brilliant that's
A	but
B	how I'd like to go
A	I think she was suffering from angina which my mother she collapsed at one she was eighty-eighty-one
B	mm
A	and she she was in the ambulance so they were doing something to her in the ambulance when I got there and said right you can follow us we're going to
B	mm
A	what is it? what's the name of the hospital?
B	I don't actually know
A	oh you don't know it do you?
B	yeah
A	whatever I think er
A	so I followed them but they went as far as
B	mm
A	and they got got in and we were parked behind these ambulances and they waited for these two this these people to come cos they were the only medics on duty that could give this injection she needed
B	oh
A	or somebody or or maybe they'd got it on their ambulance whatever I can't you know I guess
B	mm
A	and and they had to wait and these guys got in and they gave this injection
B	mm
A	the ambulance was rocking about I think
B	mm
A	they were giving her the old
B	resuscitation
A	form they had two you know all that
B	wow
A	and like but dad was
B	she really was out of it
A	oh yeah my dad was you know I thought he was sitting there like just staring into space like this is it you now?
B	yeah
A	oh she survived that we got her to
B	oh okay
A	at eighty-one
B	yeah
A	it would have been
B	they come out quite well
A	I remember being yeah I I remember going up there
B	pretty serious
A	surgery serious stuff
B	gonna hurt
A	and er
B	mm
A	you know you might not you know
B	pull through it
A	and er my mother's medically trained anyway she's a physiotherapist you know
B	oh right
A	and she said well I know that if I don't have this surgery I haven't got much of a life I'm gonna be bedridden and he said well you're right and she said so yeah of course I'm gonna go go for it
B	mm
A	and she did and christ after the operation she's in this intensive care it was like the cockpit of a jumbo jet there's TV screens there's a nurse there full time she's got pipes coming out here
B	oh yeah
A	and they give her an injection
B	it's very intensive
A	and they put it into a pipe and
B	for the nurses yeah
A	you know not into her and she was there but they couldn't bring her out they kept her they kept her anaesthetised they couldn't bring her out straight away cos she was trying to rip all the pipes out
B	oh
A	they brought her out slowly it took three days to bring her round
B	mm
A	you know?
B	so what's the secret between your mum and dad then?
A	I don't know I don't know what it is
B	they love it each other don't they?
A	they must do
B	they haven't gone right off on different paths
A	but
B	oh yeah
A	yeah great
B	I mean they've been together for like sixty years or something
A	you know seventy years soon coming up to sixty-seven years
B	and how can they last when others don't even last a couple of years?
A	I don't know
B	oh she's pretty gung ho your mum
A	we rang we rang up
B	bloody hell
A	to see erm
B	mm
A	and you go private and said it's better to go there because they've got prosthesis
B	mm
A	than than the private hospital has
B	mm
A	erm and all all we had to pay for was the physio we came in on Sunday
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah okay
A	because it was being done by private
B	yeah
A	er you know
B	yeah yeah
A	and it worked out about four thousand really bloody
B	for a new knee
A	it was seventeen
B	for a new knee
A	a new knee
B	mm
A	and that is meaning that she can have it then and not wait like two years
B	mm
A	or whatever
B	she's pretty gung ho your mum
A	and and she went
B	a new knee's not an easy
A	no
B	thing to have
A	I know and she went in she went in in a wheelchair you know with a
A	no I wheeled her in that's right and she walked to the door I wheeled her I put her in the wheelchair and took her in on the Saturday
B	mm
A	and I picked her up on the Thursday she walked out
B	oh
A	she walked out with her new knee
B	I'd love to meet your mum and dad
A	oh they're great
B	I'd love to
A	mm
B	they haven't given up on life
A	dad sometimes he er you
B	some people just give up
A	oh no they
B	well that's
A	you know
B	that's well I mean you know
A	but that
B	that would kind of make sense in a way wouldn't it?
A	well it wouldn't it it would really because I mean
B	I don't know how they do it
A	these days that's they prefer that the local authorities and
B	no I know they do
A	a lot of the local authorities
B	yeah
A	encourage it because it's cheaper
B	well it is
A	it's cheaper for them to send their
B	do they have anyone to come round?
A	help around
B	you know what? there's some old folk
A	yeah
B	they are just
A	they are though
B	they are invincible
A	mum still cooks her meals and they
B	they're invincible
A	they've got erm they've got a friend who's kind of a bit younger than a bit older than me but younger than them like a generation in between us
B	mm
A	and they're very good to mum and dad cos mum and dad used to look after their kids when they lived in
B	mm
A	they've really been good friends they're quite wealthy he he was erm in banking you know and he was
B	mm
A	he's quite wealthy and they always send mum this sort of mum and dad this sort of hamper at Christmas with these ready ready done meals that you can freeze
B	which is brilliant for old people
A	and you know these things
B	brilliant for older
A	like venison and you know
B	it's even brilliant for me
A	venison and cranberry sauce with roast potato and and beautiful I mean the high quality bloody meals and they put them in the freezer and they have those as a special treat oh they they do alright
B	they do alright
A	and and
B	alright
B	is it?
A	I mean they've had their they've had er their house which is my house and my brother's
B	mm
A	cos they put it into my name ages ago cos they didn't want to be dad said they'd worked all their lives and they didn't wanna have their you know what they've worked all their lives for
B	inheritance tax
A	taken because a lot of local authorities
B	yeah
B	yeah absolutely
A	and if you haven't got a house and it doesn't live all of your life and sponged off the government
B	mm
A	you know they they've got the right to live there till they die
B	mm
A	both of them
B	yeah
A	so not that I I didn't really want want it but I mean er dad felt happier he didn't want to be giving away all everything he's worked for and I can understand that
B	mm mm
A	they put it in for free can do it and I said are you sure they can do that when you don't own the house dad? you know I'm thinking I'll get in all this bloody trouble you know he said no it doesn't matter even if you were renting it they do it
B	mm
A	and they put erm foamy stuff in the walls they
B	yeah
A	insulated the attic
B	wow
A	the fire brigade came round and fitted mains fire alarms the police came round and put
B	locks
A	security chains
B	yeah
A	on the doors the council came round and put handles and things outside so they can get in and out I mean they're absolutely incredible and this I'm I'm a bit mutton and Jeff there were I mean my father is as well and I used to go round there and even with my ears the TV was so loud that it'd give me headache
A	I'd go to I said I'm going to bed now I'd be going to bed at nine o'clock the two of them will get in the chair have the TV on so bloody loud it's killing my ears and then they'd fall asleep like
A	sod this I'm going to bed
A	and then they cleared got the I was there about two two three years ago I think it was
B	so funny
A	I was I was sitting there and I thought I can't hear the television and they're both there watching it you know? and I can't hear a bloody thing
A	I
A	and they've got a thing called the loop
B	oh yes that's very good
A	and so they they become
B	yeah
A	an ear phone so they watch
B	yeah they're very good
A	so they watch they can
B	but yes
A	they they've got so they're sitting there watching it like er they've got an ear in
B	yeah that's very
A	and I'm sitting there
B	yeah
A	lip reading
B	yeah
A	so I
B	that's excellent
A	oh but
B	yeah
A	and that's that's something paid for locally
B	yeah yeah
A	they come and do it
B	yeah
A	so there they are
B	but this lady I work for
A	mm
B	erm not invented the hearing aid but the
A	yeah
B	has brought it along leaps and bounds
A	yeah
B	they technologised it you know
A	yeah
B	with the hearing loop they they've actually keep on working on it and erm and yeah it's phenomenal
A	mm
B	what they can do for people but you you should get your hearing sorted out
A	I I have and I I I
B	what do you mean you have?
A	well I've got I've got this thing
B	which ear is it? is it both?
A	er both both I need it
B	right
A	in both I've got my some
B	yeah
A	then he said right this is the best one for you you can't have one of those that
B	right
A	and I said right okay and he put one on switched you know all the
B	yeah
A	all there adjusted it with the computer and he said how's that sound? and I said bloody awful I said I can hear all sorts of things
B	yeah
A	I said what's that bloody row?
A	he said that's the fan on his computer
A	he said you've got to realise you haven't been hearing like that
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and that's how you should be hearing and I said
B	yeah
A	well I don't wanna hear all that
B	mm
A	and it's a little thing that clips in your ear and it's not a hearing aid as such
B	mm
A	it's an amplifier
B	mm
A	right?
B	mm
A	fifty quid
B	mm
A	with a self charger cos these hearing aids you spend a fortune on batteries
B	mm mm okay
A	and this thing
B	I didn't know that
A	this is a self charger it charges
B	yeah
A	like up on one AA battery

B	yeah
A	huge place but it it
B	they're amazing your parents
A	well they are I mean I I've got a ridiculous I can't imagine not having them around to be quite honest
B	I know
A	I mean I'm
B	you'll probably be gutted
A	I'm nearly seventy myself
B	I know
A	and I'm and I've got my
A	who come with both their parents you know and I'm thinking
B	you're gonna be
A	that's gonna be me
B	you're gonna be
A	you know give me
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	give me some bloody credit
A	when you're well yeah
B	mm
A	it thins the blood and he said they're messing about with my medicine at the moment cos a nurse comes round and checks it you know and you have to you have to have that
B	yeah you do lots of
A	you have to have it the level's gotta be kept right
B	they that's right yeah
A	cos he's
B	yeah
A	oh yes he's got er irregular heartbeat or something
B	right
A	which I don't think is particularly serious but
B	yeah
A	he had prostate cancer in his eighties erm late seventies
B	mm
A	when he came out from that he was all stooped and everything but you know I think the anaesthetic works like that when you're
B	yeah it shrivels you up a bit
A	until you're you you can
B	yeah
A	until you can er it keeps you like low until you're
B	yeah
A	well again
B	yeah
A	and he was up and out again not long after that and he was eighty-one and he went in at Christmas and he said it would be nine months he said unless you got we've got a slot at Christmas day do you want er do you want it? and he said yeah
B	yeah
A	bloody right
B	operating on people on Christmas day
A	yeah yeah
B	no
A	prodding me sticking
B	no
A	their fingers up my arse again and all that I'm not going through all of that cos it is it's bloody horrible I've been through it all it's horrible
B	yeah
A	and you know and in a way he's right you know ninety well what do you expect?
B	of course he's right
A	you're gonna die of something
B	you're gonna die of something yeah
A	he said oh I'm not going to have all that and I I think that's I was just thinking like
B	mm
A	and we
B	he just ignored it
A	we told yeah he bought it all but you know if that guy had realised what palliative care was or and all this I don't think he realised he wouldn't have gone back to bloody
B	mm
A	and had had all that chemo and died in bloody you know there he'd have stayed here
B	yeah well the day that my dad erm sent an email through that said
A	yeah
B	it was like a knowing
A	yeah
B	I didn't need to be told anything I just knew it
A	yeah
B	but then denying it all
A	mm
B	because you're denying anything
A	yeah
B	and he goes okay oh jeez don't think like that
A	but they but they don't
B	and I said I said but I know
A	yeah
B	and then the thing that went wrong was I kept saying to my dad I want to come over to England now because I don't think she'd got very long
A	who said that?
B	I did
A	yeah
B	oh no no no you come when you've booked your flight you come you're coming soon in two weeks' time you've booked your flight just come with
A	she died
B	she died
A	bloody hell
B	but only because she was hanging on for us
A	mm
B	you could tell in her eyes I said mum you've been holding on for us haven't you? she goes yeah
A	cor dear
B	but I have managed to hold on and then you know then the last shot I have of her is my mental picture of her is that she's got this look and she's got this you know when people
A	mm
B	are triumphant?
A	yeah
B	and they kind of like you know
A	oh yeah
B	go all
B	really high on morphine as well
A	wow
B	so she's got that kind of look and I said oh look I'm just popping out I'll be back in twenty minutes
A	mm
B	plane journey to see my mum that didn't look like my mum
A	mm
B	and I was down the the the in the garden
A	what?
B	I really don't think she's got two or three days is what I said
A	yeah yeah
B	and then my brother comes and he goes yeah and then I went oh
A	mm
B	and then he just put his arm round me and he said
A	she'd gone?
B	that's the last
A	yeah
B	you know like this and I got in through the door and the first thing my dad said was pull yourself together
A	yeah
B	you know spent you know quite a while kind of going in and out and kind of talking to her and cos I read something somewhere that erm it probably more of a Buddhist kind of thing I dunno maybe other spiritual ideas too that the the soul can hang about
A	mm yeah yeah
B	in the area
A	yeah yeah
B	you know
A	yeah yeah I erm
B	and she died in the living room cos
A	mm yeah
B	she was downstairs right she wanted to be in the path
A	mm mm
B	of what was happening you know
A	yeah
B	she didn't wanna be cooped upstairs
A	mm upstairs no
B	she wanted to be right at the bosom
A	yeah
B	of the family so erm so she died away in her she died in the living room and erm yeah I
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	oh yeah I'm I'm it
B	sat and
A	well I think you know that that's if you if it's a pity you didn't come to that talk because of
A	mm? yeah
B	yeah
A	he he was saying about it's it's not so much it's those orbs I don't know if he's showed you the photographs of the orbs
B	yeah
A	you know I mean? the
B	well he hasn't shown me but I've seen orbs before
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it's er the orbs and I said well so are those the spirits of the people? and he said well not as such they're energy and they're by
B	mm
A	a number of people
B	mm mm
A	and erm he can see them
B	mm
A	he can actually
B	oh I'm sure you can
A	oh he he can see them
B	I'm sure if you open your eyes
A	and he said if you er you get attuned to it you'll be able to see them
B	oh you can see them everywhere probably
A	yeah and you know how many photos have I got with those on I'd take in Turkey and places? you know in in ancient sites I've got and I thought what a shit photo and I've probably deleted the bloody things but I've got
B	cos they're actually
A	I've had loads with
B	yeah
A	those orbs on
B	yeah
A	erm I must look through my photos cos I know I have but anyway erm
B	yeah
A	and
B	oh right
A	he wanted
B	he was a neurosurgeon and
A	yeah he was
B	he went into a coma?
A	a neurosurgeon himself he went into a coma he was in the hospital where he worked
B	oh that
A	he was in heaven
B	okay I know who the guy is
A	okay?
B	yeah
A	have you read it?
B	yeah I no I haven't read it but I've read
A	yeah
B	some short summaries of it yeah
A	I think it was in the paper not long ago
B	yeah yeah
A	and I
B	yeah I've read some short summaries
A	and and er and in actual fact they know he he said that because he they were monitoring his brain there was no activity so it wasn't
B	yeah
A	cos a lot of these er it's your imagination you know you go into one of these near death experiences you imagine this and you see but
B	but don't you still have chemicals going round your body although you've died?
A	eh?
B	you know the reason for
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you've got that chemical
A	yeah the drug where but all the all these things were the if you were if you were experiencing like a dream if you like
B	yeah they'd be able to monitor
A	there would be activity on the brain
B	yeah yeah
A	and he had none because they were they were sure he was dead
B	mm
A	brain dead
B	mm
A	and he wasn't and he came out of the coma
B	mm
A	and he said what he saw and you know
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	it that that that that interested me and I'd like to have read that book because I actually think and I and
B	have you?
A	yeah I I
B	what?
A	I believe well I believe that you know like
B	yeah
A	ten percent
B	yeah
A	he said what's the rest of it for? and I think they're right and I think the subconscious
B	is that his idea
A	it's subconscious
B	or is he
A	sorry?
B	is that his idea?
A	yeah it's his idea
B	oh it's his idea? right okay
A	oh he's a new idea
B	it's not from yeah
A	and I'm thinking if it's if
B	right
A	I think it could be I think funnily enough when I was sitting in this er church hall listening to
B	auras
A	like a light round him
B	yeah
A	and there was a a light going off him and I er like a stick going up
B	yeah
A	up there and I thought that's odd
B	yeah that's a bit odd
A	and then he did something else and I went and I
A	I
B	no but but
A	and I went back
B	but you know what?
A	and it and it was it wasn't there anymore but you know as as erm
B	don't you find he's a very vibrational person?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you see I go on vibrations of people
A	yes but he he he wasn't
B	I know
A	pushing this what what I liked about
B	no I know
A	he wasn't pushing this
B	no he he he
A	he was just talking about
B	well
A	his experience and
B	erm
B	vibrations
A	to
B	you know
B	mm
A	and then he went over and did this thing and he said er you've got erm
B	something wrong with you
A	you no you've got a whatsit er allergy haven't you? and he said
B	yeah
A	yeah and he said right and and then and he and that it
B	bloody hell
A	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	yeah oh
B	yeah yeah
B	but you know what? so his his what his theory then is that the subconscious is outside
A	yeah
B	of your body?
A	no that's
B	oh that's
B	why does
A	I don't know because
A	not a
B	sorry it's the way you said it
A	yeah yeah
B	the look on your face
A	well he he
B	sort of
A	he alright he left his wife who I thought was a really nice girl and and I thought they were a perfect partnership and and he he played around a little bit
B	did he just get bored?
A	he always came back
B	oh
A	you know and he
B	oh
B	god
A	but he always came home
B	oh that's very nice of him
A	time he said I'm leaving you
B	he can get himself lost
A	I'm leaving you for this you know Thai woman and she oh
B	oh crikey
A	talk about a woman scorned
B	well you see? he should have stayed with the other one
A	yeah yeah
A	he went to see this shaman
A	he could levitate and everything and he and and as
B	mm
A	you know it's a good time to go to battle it's not a good time and all all that like a witch doctor you know
B	mm
A	or whatever and they knew a lot and they dabbled with all of this they knew all about dowsing and all of that
B	mm
A	they knew all about all of that
B	mm
A	and
B	what do you think then?
A	yeah I I think there's a lot of I think there's a lot in it I'm beginning now as I get erm if I if you'd asked me
B	you probably wouldn't be interested
B	yeah
A	at all but I think that seriously and when I found I can do it
B	yeah
A	when it happens to me and erm
B	yeah
A	and those sticks move
B	yeah
A	it just worried me cos it whacked me in the face
A	one morning and I was got up at six cos he said they're much stronger in the morning
B	you told me you told me yeah
A	and I was just trying to
A	hang on I've gotta I've gotta know what I'm dabbling with here
B	well you do
A	I mean I I found out someone died
B	could be black magic
A	had died in my office and I
A	I said I'm not
B	and this is
A	cos cos
B	who's been to a shaman
A	yeah well
B	in Africa or Thailand?
A	oh Thailand
B	right
A	and this shaman knew everything about him he was saying oh you've been yeah you've been a naughty boy you've done blah blah blah and he knew everything about
B	no I'm not saying it's not true
A	these people these people that can
B	I'm not saying it's not true I'm genuinely not interested
A	right
B	now there are some things that fascinate me
A	yes but there are there are there are things I'm I'm interested in this dowsing I'm not interested in talking to the dead
B	I'm interested in dowsing
A	I'm not interested in any of that
B	I'm interested in that
A	I'm interested
B	yeah
A	in is finding historical sites
B	yeah
A	and finding the information he's found out by er he reckons the furthest back in time he's been is thirteen and a half thousand years and he has has found erm he's not spoken to you you can't speak to
B	questions you get the answer
A	it's like binary
B	yeah yeah
A	it's like a binary computer
B	yeah
A	it's got to be yes and no yes and no
B	yeah
A	and by asking the right questions you get this information and he found these ten virgin girls they were thirteen
B	no no I've heard this story
A	thirteen years old
B	I've heard this story
A	yeah?
B	yeah yeah I've heard the story yeah
A	and all of this and that's the furthest he's
B	yeah
A	been back in time
B	but you know what I like about him? is that he's not a big mouth big shot
A	no he's not trying to sell this on you he's this is
B	no
A	my experiences
B	but you know you
A	you can
B	he's
A	take it or leave
B	he's
A	he doesn't care
B	but he started
A	I know yeah
B	and he's got to be seventies now
A	yeah
B	early eighties you know
A	yeah
B	and erm so he's been doing it for a number of years
A	oh yeah
B	but also
A	and
B	but also but also it you know he didn't make his whole entire living out of that he
A	no no
B	had his own company and he did
A	mm
B	really well and he's quite a wealthy fella I think with his wife
A	mm
B	she's she's chatty and erm
A	she's meant to be
B	yeah she's lovely I met her
A	she yeah
B	on the one of the first walks I went on
A	mm
B	and I really liked her but you see I'm gonna say I really liked her before I knew that
A	uhu
B	and then when I met her husband
A	mm
B	cos they were all like walking and I was in a new area so I don't remember very much about other people
A	mm
B	and erm
A	mm
B	particularly in nature where people feel more relaxed
A	yeah
B	and they're meant to be a bit more
A	mm
B	like themselves
A	mm
B	rather than guarded around a table
A	mm
B	right? is that certain people are drawn towards me
A	mm
B	just as er certain people I'm drawn towards and like the same with you
A	yeah yeah
B	I can sense
A	mm
B	that's where I could feel
A	yeah
B	a very different type of thing
A	yeah
B	coming to me
A	oh I
B	and people think I'm a bit mad
A	yeah yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	and go oh stop being such a woman you know you're just being quite sensitive you know you've got like a period or something I'm like
A	mm
B	just
A	yeah
B	I know
A	I it's a
B	I know
A	yeah it's a vibe you know
B	I know
A	I I I yeah
B	I frigging know
A	no I mean yeah
B	and that's why I believe in these energies
A	mm
B	I believe in them
A	dancing
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	yep yes
A	when you think about all the decisions in life
B	yeah
A	you come to a point and oh do I go that way? a bit like the binary
B	mm yeah
A	or you know you can
B	yeah
A	go that way and
B	yeah
A	now if I'd gone that way I could have been in the same place but gone on a different route
B	yeah
A	and er and and that's the thing that amazes me you just have to make one wrong decision and you know
B	why would you say wrong decision? why wrong?
A	well
B	why not a decision?
A	the other decision
B	yeah
A	like the other decision
B	the alternative decision
A	not the wrong
B	yeah
A	the other one
B	yeah
A	but you know erm when I was talking to the doctor who was treating my wife in Germany I said what causes her to get these attacks? why is it you know it seems to happen every year you know? it's like and she said well
B	yeah
A	that can be er the
B	yeah
A	all around
B	yeah yeah
A	you know?
B	she was like highly strung then?
A	well yes highly strung
B	yeah
A	but you could say highly strung
B	maybe she was very sensitive
A	but you but you know when I did find out
B	no no
A	I but I wondered whether it was the pressure of Christmas
B	yeah
A	doing the food doing the meal
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but it wasn't
B	the food
A	when she died and I started going through all the paperwork I knew she'd had a child before
B	right
A	erm and I didn't I did actually know he was born on Christmas day and died on Christmas day
B	oh god
A	but then it then it kind of hit me then
B	yeah
A	that that it's something quite cos I knew that
B	one of the worst reasons of all
A	freaked it and it was always
B	and like yeah
A	started at middle of you know it's like the advent calendar
B	yeah yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	it had to be the reason
B	of course
A	and erm
B	what happened to the little fella?
A	eh?
B	the baby what happened?
A	I think just I dunno
B	was it cot death or something like or?
A	no no it died in hospital
B	was it
A	it died in
B	jesus
A	but I I saw pictures
B	you'd think he was a Hell's Angel oh my god
A	he was leader and she worked in a club and er met him and er I dunno I
B	oh dear
A	she I mean she'd come home she'd work all night at
B	yeah
A	big German company in in
B	he'd
A	a lot of the times he was in a drunken stupor she saved his life about three times
B	yeah
A	yeah but other times she'd come home and something something would be missing and she'd go what's missing? bloody freezer's gone he'd have sold it to buy alcohol
B	yeah yeah
A	and he he
B	oh right okay
A	they didn't label you you know?
B	yeah
A	and he said well it could be a number of things he said it could be erm
B	yeah
A	her mother was a manic depressive
B	yeah
A	it could be erm I think the awful things that happened in her life or terrible things that happened
B	mm
A	to her we won't go into them all but there were she told me some of them and they were awful
B	mm
A	and erm it could be change of er
B	mm
A	and she was she was born in the country in in er in
B	oh right
A	at
B	where's that?
A	near
B	oh right
A	in Turkey
B	okay yeah yeah
A	erm so she was born in the country but when her father died at forty-two he was forty-two she was forty-two when she died
B	forty-two is one of my best numbers
A	when when he died she was whisked up to
B	yeah
A	that sort of thing
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know? yeah
B	yeah yeah no it could be no it could be
A	so there's two changes of culture
B	well yeah yeah
A	and then she goes to Germany
B	yeah
A	and marries a German and there's another culture
B	yeah
A	and then she comes to Wales
B	yeah
A	and there's another culture
B	yeah
A	so she had all the all the makeups to have that that illness
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	called the what?
B	it's called The Presence Process it's a bit of a naff name
A	breathing?
B	anyway
A	yeah
B	but in the mornings I do fifteen minutes of of of breathing as in a particular type of breathing and at night I do the same
B	anyway I did it I started doing it here while I was at the cottage
A	mm
B	and the first week and a half I was just bawling it all the time like if
A	mm
B	I would have like a massive like emotional release
A	yeah
B	this was stuff from a couple of years ago
A	yeah
B	about like my mum dying
A	mm
B	that's a small part of it but this was I was like I didn't even know they existed
A	mm
B	anyway I'm not crying quite as much now but I'm still doing my breathing I've got erm to the end of February just to to go until I finish this thing
A	mm
B	and it's all I do is breathe
A	yeah
B	but I read the text and the text is basically saying that
A	mm
B	and then then you're born
A	mm
B	articulating anything cos you haven't got a language yet
A	yeah
B	so you're all about yourself feeling
A	yeah
B	that's when your mental
A	right
B	like oh that's mum that's dad
A	mm
B	mum and dad
A	mm
B	and then you use your emotions for various
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	very young individuals like even
A	yeah
A	three to seven right?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	like apparent zero to seven a lot of stuff happens in your life
A	yeah
B	which you can't remember it
A	no right right oh yeah
B	but you are actually holding on
A	yeah
B	to some really interesting
A	mm
B	stuff which it might not be actually all that good for you
A	mm
B	so this thing is all about letting it all kind of come to the surface which it kind of does
A	yeah
B	then you've got to integrate it but the book's kind of like
A	yeah
B	and the idea is that you kind of let it go
A	mm
B	and that's what I was saying as went through the door I was thinking about erm
A	yeah
B	you've gotta let stuff go
A	yeah yeah
B	if there's an earthquake yes that makes sense
A	yeah yeah
B	some other stuff needs to let go too
A	yeah yeah
B	cos you can let the earthquake go too
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know
A	yeah yeah
B	she's she's hanging on
A	yeah yeah right
B	to something and we do hold on
A	yeah
B	to our little stories
A	mm
B	about life
A	yeah
B	you know and things that we can't work out and actually being here and being in the cottage and being in a a rural village I would say
A	good
B	to be able to go through this process
A	yeah yeah
B	you couldn't start bawling it in Tesco could you?
A	no
A	yeah
B	like oh dear
A	yeah
B	what's wrong with her?
A	mm
B	and you couldn't be sitting on a bus you know or a train and start going well they'd probably ignore me anyway cos they're all looking at their bloody mobile phone but here I can just sit there and I'll just go oh and I'm like oh it doesn't even make sense but like I know what's happening is in a way is that being here I'm talking about destiny
A	yeah
B	being here is conditionally as in optimum conditions is the right place to be
A	mm yeah
B	okay I could be in a mountain tree
A	yeah
B	in Thailand
A	yeah
B	but I'm not I'm here
A	right
B	cos I've got
A	no exactly
B	people like you
A	oh
B	and people like
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and people like
A	yeah
B	so
A	and yet
B	I haven't
A	yet and yet
B	I haven't whisked that up from nowhere
A	no
B	have I?
A	but it and it
B	you know
A	yeah and the the other thing by by being here and meeting people like
B	no I wouldn't
A	because we're all
B	yeah
A	from different walks of
B	yeah
A	yet
B	yeah
A	we're here bunged together
B	yeah that's it
A	that's what I like
B	yeah
A	about it you
B	yeah
A	you know and that's
B	and you get on
A	with various people and with all
B	yeah
A	these people and with with some I'm thinking I don't
A	and he
B	yeah
A	he's just a he's just a they're just like a couple of twins really
B	oh really oh god
A	but one's
B	yeah
A	obviously old
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	you know and I
B	have
A	known those
B	known them
A	I wouldn't have
B	yeah
A	had no contact with people
B	yeah
A	that would
B	yeah
A	not not like them they they're
B	yeah
B	oh
A	and erm you know so I certainly
B	oh okay
A	wouldn't have been
B	yeah
A	I thought he was army but it sounds to me like he was
B	police yeah
A	cos
B	oh god
A	dowsers looking for that boy they never found
B	oh
A	so and he said he said yes yes yeah we yes we had dowsers on our books so he was obviously some high up policeman
B	probably yeah
A	so you know
B	yeah
A	you know you meet all
B	you do
A	and I found
B	you meet
A	I find
B	yeah
A	the expats cos I said my Land Rover had a lot of problems with it in the early days when I was out here and and it was the computer not the Land Rover but the
B	mm
A	I actually got it sorted by a guy down in
A	you know? and he got all the software just by the
B	oh my god
A	both of the dealers north and south
B	couldn't fix it
A	couldn't solve it but he could with his laptop
B	just some dude with a laptop
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	and it didn't cost me that much and er all it was was a wire that wasn't earthing properly it was the computer
A	and anyway in that time I didn't the car was off the road I mean so you know having it checked and everything
A	car I'm going to be who would lend you their car in the UK?
B	well
A	I don't
B	no
A	you know
B	yeah
A	for a week to have a
B	yeah
A	job done can I borrow your your wife's car?
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	oh it wouldn't bloody happen
B	yeah no no one would lend you
A	no here
B	lend you a car yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	his he had this bloody posh car with leather seats that heated up and it told you if your tyre pressures
B	yeah
A	were going down
B	yeah
A	he said
B	yeah
A	we're going to the UK for three weeks you can have that and I said are you sure
A	so yes
B	yeah but I wouldn't wanna drive a Land Rover not
A	I
B	in this weather
A	no erm
B	no no
A	but he's a funny guy
B	larger than life she sounds as larger than life
A	mm but I think she had great control on him
B	well that's probably
A	he's actually
B	not a bad thing
A	he's er no I think he's
B	no I know you said
A	he was a horrible guy you know
B	yeah yeah
A	such a bloody know all
B	yeah
A	you couldn't say anything without him
B	yeah
A	shooting you down in flames
B	yeah
A	and yet
B	yeah
A	he didn't know I I live in the village so I know everybody by their name
B	yeah
A	and he didn't even know the names of some of them
B	yeah well
A	and you know
B	before you said that
A	yeah
B	had a really good bonfire which we had
A	yeah
B	and we had it at night you know so it was
A	yeah
B	a bit like oh few drinks look at the stars a bit like that
A	yeah
B	a big great big bonfire
A	I can see what you're gonna say I know go on
B	so I said oh but it was a bit of a do to actually get it erm to get it going to get it alight
A	mm
B	sort of look in his face? and like
A	yeah
B	out so we realised it was too green and there were green bits you know that was
A	mm
B	wet and green so we had to think of another idea and I said well
A	mm
B	on the paper he goes you never need fuel to light a bonfire you don't light you don't light bonfires with fuel
A	yeah
B	and I said also we put sunflower oil on the paper that was
A	mm
B	erm just to give it a little bit of kick right?
B	because it hadn't worked otherwise and that was a bit of fuel too he goes oh I know what you mean I know what you mean but you never need fuel you don't need any fuel any he said
A	no well you you can't argue no no
B	I thought oh I was getting sharp with him I'm gonna shut up now
A	no right
B	because I'm not gonna argue
A	you're gonna get into an argument
B	yeah exactly
A	I mean
B	but there was a bit of that came out
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah he does he can't help himself but I mean he has got better I mean he's a
B	he's a lovely guy
A	oh yeah but you know
B	I really like him
A	I think he he's erm he's changed a lot if you knew him when
B	do you think he might hook up with another
A	yeah well I think he'd like to
B	he seems to like company
A	I think he's got he's got to
A	okay those burgundy I mean he had a pair that were the most awful trousers when he wore them I thought
B	you were so funny when you were describing that
A	they they got they got a a waistband
B	I know
A	the the leg the legs
A	were
B	no I'll tell you what
A	yeah
B	when he left on that day when we took him into you know
A	mm
B	when we dropped him off regards to you know?
A	did he look smart?
B	he had a really pukka nice red
A	mm
B	expensive raincoat which was an
A	yeah
B	all weather raincoat and I noticed and saw it I'd I kind of think I'd have one
A	did he have his burgundy cords on?
B	I I admired them he had a really nice pair of all weather really good pair of you know travel trousers
A	trousers yeah right
B	that will just be great for everything
A	he must have gone shopping someone's taken him
B	he had a nice pair of
A	do you think he has already?
B	he had a nice pair of all weather shoes
A	do you think he do you think he's got a girlfriend? cos I mean when I I when I saw him on New Year's day in his burgundy cords I thought well
B	do you know what?
A	what?
B	when he got his two little bags out of his BMW that's where I knew he hadn't really changed because he looked the part but he had these two little bags like little holdalls right?
B	okay right that you take you know to badminton or something like that
A	yeah yeah
B	and you know what I mean? but they're they're they're not like it's not like you have to buy expensive bags to
A	no
B	to be anyone
A	no no
B	or anything all I'm saying is is that it was a laugh because
A	yeah yeah
B	he'd looked quite pukka
A	oh
B	and then it was like oh look these little two holdalls
A	yeah
B	and I said god he's travelling light and
A	yeah
B	and it's light
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but you don't actually get dirty
A	no yeah
B	they're expensive materials do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	self cleaning fabric
A	yeah
B	but it's so
A	well I'm I'm glad he's spent a bit of money cos he needed a new wardrobe
B	well he's spent shitloads of money
A	yeah well I mean er that's good he's spending it on clothes though because those bloody trousers I'll tell they're I mean I didn't I didn't like to say anything cos I don't know him that and I'm not that close to him I mean
B	oh god
A	the material you oh god
B	oh god
A	they were
B	oh no I don't know
A	they were awful
B	you know I dunno but erm I think I think he's still got it in him
A	oh I think he's quite young I'm sure he'd like to meet somebody
B	I think he
A	mm
B	I get the impression
A	yeah
B	he does
A	there was one time actually I went I went round to his place for something
A	on the job or what? I don't
B	oh
A	I can't remember why I went down
A	it was something I went went down for
A	and he came running out to the gate and went yeah yeah yeah yep okay yep yeah okay
B	yes I'm off
A	yeah er yeah yeah er
A	and I said you alright
A	I really thought I I'd caught him at it
B	oh I think it's funny
A	so that's er
B	I think that's funny
A	yeah
B	oh I dunno
A	I thought oh who have you got in there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well he's probably one of those
B	cos it sounds like you know like
A	yeah
B	individual
A	I liked
B	yeah she was
A	what sixty-nine?
B	coming up to sixty-nine
A	sixty-nine
B	like my mum
A	she
B	she led a healthy according to him
A	yeah yeah
B	like my mum died but she didn't lead a very healthy lifestyle in the end
A	yeah but I don't I don't think that
B	and she was
A	I don't think I think that's erm
B	but it is
A	yeah
B	she'd come round
A	but then what well what she did do she went out in the sun a lot and she didn't
B	oh
A	I can remember having her I can remember seeing her she had this great big thing on her lip
B	and they'd cut it out
A	and came round to see us and
B	oh
A	the that was the bursts of
B	oh
A	secondary
B	yeah
A	in I mean
B	yeah
A	I mean I really did and and she
B	yeah
A	you know she was an outdoor girl
A	and I can't imagine her slapping on the old sun tan lotion I really can't
B	you can't be too careful with that
A	and I I think
B	people don't realise
A	mm
B	you can get brown
A	but I walk around in it but I never bother putting cream on
B	mm
A	I never have done
B	yeah no I wear
A	I think I think people who people who
B	living in Australia
A	get people who get burnt should
B	oh
A	I never I've never got
B	I've got burnt the thing is but I mean since living in Australia I'm fairly careful
A	yeah
B	even now when I go out in the sun
A	mm
B	it's winter sun
A	yeah?
B	cos I've actually even got like since I was in the desert in last year
A	yeah
B	er they're not cancerous and they're not cancer but you can tell they're like erm what do you call them? sun spots?
A	yeah
B	I probably can get them burnt off
A	yeah
B	at the moment you can't see them
A	no
B	but I probably will get them burnt off but the sun really
A	yeah
B	I don't
A	yeah well I I you know I don't
B	frigging powerful
A	I don't er yeah I know it is well I keep out of it
