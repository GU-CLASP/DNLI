A	there we are good morning
A	erm and erm
B	mm yes
A	so can you tell me er erm how er how old you were when you left Australia?
B	yes well if I can go back a step just to explain both my parents er are English
A	yeah
B	or were English and they met on a ship going out
A	right yes
B	and erm my father was a clergyman and he'd signed on for five years of
A	right right oh
B	and erm so it was a bit inconvenient really that he met my mother going out but anyway they kept in touch for five years and at the end of his five years of going around the bush erm he they got married
A	right
B	and er and then the war came and he was a chaplain in the Australian army and then erm we lived in two two parishes in
A	oh right
B	and that was quite hard for my mother because she'd left all her family behind
A	right
B	cos the whole family had emigrated but not together she'd gone separately erm so
A	yes I see it's it's it's a a bit weird because we've got similar circumstances cos my father was actually erm he he became a padre in the army erm but but he was also a vicar and we moved from
B	really?
A	and another thing that I can draw a parallel with is that when we came back from Germany cos he did three years that's all it was a sort of er appeal from the bishop for erm clergy to go abroad and when we came back there was no living for us and we had to look for one and that was extremely difficult we ended up living in
B	oh goodness me
A	isn't it strange?
B	well there's a bigger coincidence because when we came back from Australia we had to sort of stay with various people and we came to
A	erm
A	right
B	to look for a living
A	really?
B	and one of the livings that was available was
A	was it?
A	how weird
B	that is probably not just after your father left it because I'm I'm a lot older than you so it would've all happened before
A	right before how weird
B	yes yes
A	isn't the life's full of coincidences isn't it?
B	it is
A	oh oh wow yes
B	he had two parishes
A	oh right course
B	yes yes yes well at the time that wasn't the facts weren't really known
A	ah it was all secret then wasn't it?
B	it was a bit secret
A	yeah
B	and er but while we were there erm the commemoration erm stone was put up but still people didn't really know the full details unless they'd lived there all their lives and and I don't think anybody ever told us how it really happened
A	right no no it's come out a lot recently hasn't it?
B	it has yes
A	erm and erm you know it it was one of those things that you just couldn't they just couldn't erm they were having an exercise I believe weren't they?
B	yes yes
A	and then the
B	that's right yes yes yes
A	erm but you must have had a a very interesting childhood what did you what do you remember of Australia then?
B	erm well just a few impressions really erm
B	erm and I just remember playing and er remember doing in a vicarage which had had a tennis court but it was terribly overrun and er overgrown rather erm
A	oh right yeah
B	erm I had lots of cousins and I still do and I get a little visit from time to time
A	right
B	in fact erm
A	really?
B	yes
A	seventeen?
B	but they lived a long way away
A	yes yes
B	and and er so we didn't see them often but that
A	right oh right
B	we were all issued with medals which I still have
A	oh
B	but she but she didn't come because her her father died
A	oh
B	erm
A	oh right
B	but it
A	I'm sure I'm sure
B	erm but
A	yes
B	erm but I can't really remember many things I remember sort of visits to other members of the family and
A	yes what about erm did you ever go sort of on on a
B	no
A	no visits there?
B	no we were in
A	right
A	yes no no
B	I do remember
A	oh right yes
B	that was
A	right er were you are you interested at all or have you read in in the past the works of Nevil Shute?
B	yes
A	and A Town Like Alice
B	well that was I think the town or the area where my father was and so it was very interesting
A	oh was it? yes oh I've I've been I've rediscovered Nevil Shute a while ago actually
B	ah
A	I read them all when I was about sixteen and I've rediscovered them all a while ago
B	yes
A	erm and I've started rereading them but I really must keep up on that because it's amazing how clear they are in my head yet still I miss so much in my memory and going back to Nevil Shute is wonderful
B	mm mm yes
A	erm and of course it's what I'm going forty year forty years ago when I read the last book and and of it's even more
B	yes yes it's a good idea to go back and reread because I think the first time you read you read for the story don't you?
A	yes you do yes
B	the second time you you read as much for the story as for the detail or the detail as much as the story
A	do you find that too with watching drama on television? because some of the Morse for instance and the Lewis erm series I don't know whether you like them but erm we find and the Frost the good series a good drama series we find that we don't watch them
B	mm mm yes ah yes yes yes
A	erm you you see the erm the frisson between erm Lewis and er his sidekick erm and how they talk to one another and the body language and everything is just right er and and also the actors have evolved that over time they've started to work together so much that they they're actually in a relationship as the part rather than acting the part
B	yes
A	so it's very good
B	oh yeah yes that's that's an interesting aspect my my husband doesn't like
A	oh right
B	and erm I look for the bits of
A	yes
A	yeah and that really does make it fun I mean in the same way I went to school in
B	oh right
A	and I mean that's a long time ago and that was all around
B	yes yes yes
A	erm and so there is that lovely feeling
B	yes
A	but tell me about
B	right well I went to
A	oh right
B	and there was a erm well
A	right
B	it was it was impossible and looking back it it you know I I find it erm difficult really to see how I actually got through it all
A	yes yes of course yes of course
B	it was but anyway the I tried to give the cleft palate priority erm because I was working with a a surgeon who was very very eminent and did research and and erm that involved me as well to an extent but it it was it was quite hard but being in
A	yes
B	we lived in a village outside
A	right
B	and erm so travelling in and out was was quite difficult
A	yes it's like
B	oh yes
A	erm but we went to some really good lectures erm the
B	well erm not exactly because you would attend the combined cleft clinic
A	right
B	erm where there was a surgeon and maybe an orthodontist you know
A	right
B	erm and others involved in the care and in fact I would see erm the moms and erm just
A	right
B	it was fantastic but I my job was to monitor that
A	right yes
B	and if there was any sign that any more input was needed
A	right
B	erm at a certain stage then I would I would be involved not personally necessarily because erm the
A	oh
B	so I would contact the local speech and language therapists and ask them to do some work with a child if necessary
A	right yeah
B	we did some some research and looked at that and it was quite clear that that was not the way to proceed
A	no
B	and so the surgeon erm
A	right right
B	so the child had a normal anatomy to use as speech developed
A	yes yeah yeah oh erm I suppose the the the most vital part of it all and I used to work on ENTs years ago
B	oh did you?
A	yeah it's closing up the hole in the cleft isn't it?
B	yes
A	so the the the whistling and the noise isn't isn't coming down through through the opening
B	yes yes
A	erm and I always thought and also then obviously food gets inhaled and it it it must be a terrible thing to have
B	yes it was and the the the feeding is a real problem for some children
A	yes
B	there are various teats as you probably know
A	yes yes
B	various ones developed for for cleft children but erm the surgeon I worked with was closing the front of the cleft very very early
A	right
B	so the child would have a normal hard palate to press the the tongue tip against
A	right yes
B	erm they used to make plates to put into
A	yes yes
B	but I don't know I I'm now very out of date because it's so it's ten years since I retired and it's
A	yeah yes yeah and so you went on after that to do erm a more general erm
B	yes I I when I came here to
A	right yeah oh right
B	so I managed as speech therapist there in
A	absolutely yeah
B	but I was expected to do fifty percent clinical work which is I mean sheer impossibility
A	yes I can understand that
B	erm but anyway I did keep up a little bit of cleft work but mainly worked in community hospitals
A	right
B	with elderly people
A	right
B	but they're not necessarily elderly people some were people with younger people with voice problems
A	right
B	erm and well anyhow the head injuries like that
A	yes yes yes
B	so in in a way it was a good thing that I had to keep up my my clinical work because after ten years I'd felt I'd had enough of working as a manager because the budgets were getting tighter and we were expected to do more with less basically and of course the situation's got much much worse since I left
A	yes oh yes
B	erm
A	yes yes
B	he had been retired
A	right right ah
B	and I got a part time job in community hospitals
A	oh
B	and I worked there for eight years and it was lovely I worked three days a week
A	yes
B	they gave me a day for mom
A	yes
B	and I I just loved driving around and I loved
A	yes
B	and after being a manager I really relished the erm clinical again
A	yeah I can see that you did because as soon as you started talking about it your face lit up
A	yes yes
B	but we we went along with them and did them and I think ended up with quite a good service
A	great
B	which then
A	ah yes
B	and anyway that's
A	yes
B	it made me think differently
A	yes
B	erm I always thought value for money when
A	yes
B	erm and I think people also because I was then older
B	but she was so young you know I think the young therapists are remarkably mature when I compare myself eh with them when I was that age they are amazing people and erm and very academic these days
A	yes
B	but I think being older helped also in you know when you're relating to to the families as you as you do and to carers at residential nursing homes
A	mm yes
B	they have a bit more respect for you cos you're older and you've obviously seen life
A	absolutely
B	and I suppose you have more confidence as well
A	well that's right that's right I mean the confidence only comes with experience
B	yes
A	I mean it's it's erm it's it's like you go to a young doctor and erm he hasn't really learned the tricks of the trade yet and they're I mean
B	yes
A	erm and erm you know er I just changed from a very young doctor to an older doctor erm because erm ah I my erm my er care was mismanaged to such an extent that we lost our erm our private medical insurance
B	oh
A	erm I was given a a a drug that gave me a erm stroke and TIA erm just a small stroke you know
B	mm
A	erm but I did I did on two occasions I reported speech erm I I couldn't think of the right words and also my speech was slurred and erm I erm I reported it oh you know given
B	mm
A	and so but but there's been lots and lots of mistakes in that regard there've been so many mistakes with that surgery that I couldn't stand it any longer and it was more stressful going to them so now I've booked in with another doctor who well unfortunately I saw him for the first time last week and he's okay he's much older I I didn't choose him they they they won't let you choose
B	oh yeah
A	I wanted a female actually I thought it'd be much better at my age if I see a lady doctor I mean it'd be much better but they wouldn't anyway there you go
B	mm
A	erm
B	yes
A	but erm it it's just erm yes it's it's
B	that's a really awful experience you just had
A	erm just interesting what you said about value for money and also the two aspects of that and the way your face brightened up when you were saying erm about that because in the last two years running the gallery was the best thing that I ever did
B	oh was it?
A	and every time anyone asks me about it I brighten up and say
B	yes mm mm yes
A	so that's what keeps people coming back keeps the artists coming back and keeps the erm buyers coming back
B	yes
A	so there you are but I mean they used to
B	oh
A	was that something that you did?
B	no no that was my mother's actually
A	oh
B	erm it was always in her lounge
A	right
B	and erm when she died I said I'd really love that and it I think it goes rather well in here with the with the dark beams and other things
A	oh it does definitely
B	erm I just I just love it I love paintings and pictures which are not too definite and cos you can keep looking at them and see different things
A	yes absolutely well
B	oh yes yes yes yes
A	and it sort of it's sort of romantic version erm those do you think they were
B	I think they must have been
A	yes yes
B	yes
A	it's a nice isolated scene
B	yes
A	it's the sort of scene you get over the
B	yes yeah
A	in the
B	yes
A	so erm so what now now you're retired then
B	I don't have too many hobbies I'm afraid erm I did go to an art group well it was a class
A	right
B	er our teacher was lovely and he but he was a commercial artist and he got too much work which was lovely for him
A	right good for him yeah
B	erm and then we continued to meet as a group but to be honest I never wanted to
A	really?
B	no it didn't a lot of them would say oh I can't wait to get going with the painting
A	right
B	I just didn't feel like that I think perhaps although I did one or two things which I was amazed at
A	yeah
B	erm I I'm not artistic really I don't have a gift for it and I think I'm always a little bit worried about wasting time and being dissatisfied with what I've done
A	well yes it putting yourself in the right situation for it er
B	no yeah
A	it's very hard to explain she's very insidious
B	yes right
A	so erm she showed us a picture last week of a of erm well several erm pictures of of the New York erm skyline the Chicago skyline and they were all in silhouette so they were just black and she asked us using a rigger and a flat brush to erm gave us a demonstration she does a demonstration to everyone very very simple to just try some brushstrokes with these brushes to make this erm skyline or make a skyline up
B	mm
A	well honestly it it I mean
B	no oh
A	and erm she paints horizon pictures but it's very much it's very similar to the atmospheric work in that painting up on the wall where you've got the sky and and so on so you might enjoy that class
B	no I I came to the conclusion that really I like being with people
A	yeah
B	when I go to an art class I mean you have
A	yes
A	oh it's lovely to talk to you it really is and I I actually approached the library long before I got interested in this I approached the library in
B	mm yes yes yes
A	so I wanted to start it and erm they say well we we do this knitting and nattering
B	oh
A	and I said no it's not it's not gossip
B	mm
A	but they just couldn't seem to and they said would you be charging for this? and I said well obviously I'd have to ask people for the money in order us to pay for the room I can't just you know so I would do it free but so I was thinking about that but no erm they said well we we'll put it on the board with the friends of the library but when I thought they were doing origami and knitting and nattering I said no I want to raise the game a bit
B	yeah
A	it did it fell on stony ground
B	yes well what I do I have quite a lot of friends and I seemed to have filled
A	yes ah yes
B	and
A	yes getting things done
B	yes erm
A	yes of course that's it
B	erm so I don't want to to tie myself down too much
A	no
B	erm I do go to keep fit on a Friday morning
A	right
B	I've been away so I haven't been for a while but that is quite important I suppose
A	when do you do that then
B	I go to
A	oh yes I went for a couple of weeks the dancing to music thing?
B	well it's very dancey isn't it?
A	yes it is yes
B	yes
A	and I kept going the wrong way so I had to stop
B	oh well I do all the time and and some of us do perennially perpetually
A	yes
B	erm but
A	yes she is she's very nice
B	I I like the fact that it's on in the morning you see because the one I went to moved to the afternoon
A	yes
B	and although it was a better workout it was somebody called
A	oh right
B	I don't I didn't like having to keep myself sort of relatively inactive in the morning to conserve my energy for the afternoon
A	oh right
B	cos I do have limited energy
A	yes I well we all do when we get older
B	yes
A	I mean we all do yeah
B	so this one is fine it's at ten well you know ten o'clock on a Friday
A	yeah ten o'clock yes
B	and erm yeah we all I think we all do it in our own way and have our own standard
A	yes yes well I joined when I left the shop but then I but then I thought I I did try but I was going the wrong way so often and and there is a class that I really like to
B	uhu
A	which is in the afternoon again I'm not
B	uhu
A	erm but erm I've never been very good at dancing as a team member I seem to go in the opposite direction a bit like my painting
A	I'm not a team player I don't think I'm an individual and unfortunately you know that comes with its limitations erm
B	yes
A	and so I I did pay for the oh I paid for a long session with her long sessions with her erm but unfortunately erm and I paid for the keep fit society or whatever it was
B	mm
A	but erm I had to pull out erm at the time I was I was I was ill for three or four weeks with with dizziness and then I just said oh
B	mm
A	but it's a nice group isn't it?
B	it is they're very friendly and my other interest of course is is the church
A	oh right
B	I'm
A	oh tell me about
B	yes
A	yes
B	yes well erm I don't I I said I didn't want to belong to the
A	oh right
B	they're very much delegated to them by by the vicar who I have a great deal of respect for
A	right
B	which is only monthly and I'm in prayer circle which means you get requests for prayers emailed through to pray for the people
A	right oh right oh
B	it's very good actually
A	I hadn't thought of doing praying by email before
A	oh did you? email
B	but it does mean that everybody gets the prayer request simultaneously or you know
A	yes yeah
B	and if if you're away it doesn't matter too cos you know the others are doing it anyway
A	yes yeah
B	but that is something which is is tremendous and it actually means that I do pray every day and not just when I have a bit of time
A	yes I know
B	and erm
A	yes right
B	erm
A	oh right
B	you've heard of them I'm sure
A	erm yes I have yes I think so yes
B	yes and they're still going strong
A	are they? oh right
B	and that was that is something I do
A	yeah yeah
B	but erm
A	sort of person
B	I like to stick them in a vase and enjoy them
A	they look lovely in that vase I'd I'd love to get er a sketchpad now not even a pad or sketch it but just blob on some different you know just blob on some different colours there very sort of
B	yes they are lovely aren't they?
A	they're gorgeous and of course you've got the brush strokes you can see the brush strokes can't you?
B	yes
A	well I should have a go at that
B	well I might just take a photo of them and then when I when I can I'll erm paint them
A	yeah and the stems are rather nice because
B	yes yes
A	well it's a rose pink colour it's it's amazing it's really nice
B	yes
A	erm so erm we I I don't really remember it I don't know whether it's
B	no I don't think I was here then
A	well there was a young
B	oh
A	and I remember thinking at the time
B	yes
A	I can't believe it how how the church as an institution has divorced itself from Christianity and I find that very hard to to to take on board
B	it's very interesting
B	oh yes
A	and erm we were both erm you know quite mature by then and er he and his parents had lived in this area for years and he'd been an altar boy erm for years at
B	uhu
A	and erm he erm
B	mm
A	and it was during the interregnum and we rang up and the secretary told me there was no chance we could get married at
B	goodness me
A	and then and and you know and then they weren't even marrying me at
B	oh
A	and it was just like that and I thought where is bureaucracy it's gone completely mad in some cases
B	well it's a good thing my husband isn't here because
B	but I'd lived in this village in in erm
A	yes yes you've done a lot
B	came to getting married
A	oh right yes yeah
B	and that's why I wrote to the bishop
A	right
B	and erm I felt well well I don't know
A	yes
B	and the vicar
A	yeah sounds lovely
B	everybody did all they could to make it nice but
A	yes
B	with all my background
A	exactly
B	erm we couldn't get married in church
A	no exactly well my father when he was vicar of
B	mm
A	and erm it was just the way he felt about it
B	well I'm sure he's right because in fact
A	right so
B	and okay they probably he was at fault to some extent but how on earth can clergy gauge whose fault it was?
A	exactly no exactly you can't
B	no
A	and it it's like people look at you in life I mean as you get older erm and you're retired and they don't know that you've been a brilliant speech therapist in your life they don't know that I actually have written three plays and been to drama school I've been a you know I've got three professional qualifications
A	yes well it was because I was on my own for so long we didn't get married until our mid forties you see so erm it's because I've been on my own for so long and I thought well blow it I read a book once called Anybody Can Do Anything and erm it was about this girl
B	oh really?
A	and erm he started out at Clydebank as an engineer because his parents just didn't want him to go on stage at all his parents were so against it and he said he writes a bit about the basic way he was treated by the other men of course he had a very posh accent and everything
B	mm
A	and erm he said you know erm
A	the way he was reared and the way he was treated and I mean and he still passed his engineering exams he still did a good job but he went on to to be an actor and all the time he was doing it he was having small parts on the radio and
B	mm
A	so there you are
B	interesting
A	so erm is there anything else you'd like to say?
A	do you think we've finished?
B	is it fifty minutes?
A	er hang on forty-five oh we've really done really well haven't we?
B	well it hasn't been an effort
A	no how good
