C	onion and herbs
A	and what herbs?
C	mum sage
C	rosemary er oregano from Bulgaria
A	right
C	someone's got a wishbone is that you mum?
A	no
B	is that one?
C	dad's got a wishbone can you warn him please
A	do you hear darling? don't choke to death on a
B	mum tried to choke me the other day
C	uhu
D	oh dear
B	I
C	I wonder why
B	and I was
D	but a wishbone's too big
A	I had made
D	too big to eat isn't it?
A	yes
A	I had made soup from a an er just absolutely wonderful duck stock
C	yeah you said
A	but one or two tiny bits of bone
D	mm
A	slipped through and of course
D	yes
A	who gets them? your father
D	oh dear
A	and one of them did actually slightly catch in his throat
C	the queen mother
B	I gathered two major stores on their TV adverts feature the humble sprout as a sort of lonely
C	what and then bigged it up or?
B	did you see them?
C	don't think I've seen any
D	there's a there's a TV programme about a sprout
A	is there?
D	yeah this year there's a Christmas
A	oh how sweet
A	did you see that the the best ad for the year was apparently one of the oh what do you call those little creatures?
C	minions
B	meerkats
C	the meerkat
A	meerkat the meerkat the one with the little baby meerkat in it I don't know that ad actually but I love the meerkats
A	mm
C	it's organic
A	mm? uhu
D	they stock them now in our local Tesco they did when we first moved in then stopped and now they've started again
A	well having more people living here now
C	exactly
A	who actually like organic
C	or don't want to eat the factory produced
A	mm
C	they're two different things I think
A	yeah well your beef and gammon is very organic
D	do you know the name of the cow?
A	well I was just gonna say that perhaps if we'd pressed him
C	mm
A	we could have been told the name
D	right
A	of the cow
C	was it a farmers' market on the high street?
A	well no it was the what what is called the French market
C	well
A	for instance
A	mm
C	will be pleased
A	well
C	mm
A	but
C	I didn't really notice
A	twenty-nine P
D	so
A	well they didn't have any lemons
D	no
A	that's pretty amazing they didn't have any streaky bacon I mean there were vast areas the not empty but you know they were
D	mm
A	refurbishing or had or had refurbished and and reached the stage where they'd run out
D	wow
A	I mean no lemons that's really quite amazing
C	we actually it turns out we have lemons
A	what dear?
C	we actually have lemons as it turns out
D	mm
A	mm and the really frustrating thing is we meant to bring up about half a dozen lemons
C	home grown
D	mm
A	as organic as we could possibly have
D	well the bread flour there was only two packets of bread flour in Tesco so
A	really?
D	obviously who has a bread maker has probably bought them up
A	oh
D	for Christmas
A	mm
C	and no macaroni
D	no macaroni anywhere
C	just as nice
D	maybe everyone was put off by the news reports of two hours to queue
A	or actually even probably more so by the the disaster at Bluewater
D	what happened at Bluewater?
A	what happened at er two days ago it cos it was in the news yesterday
D	I have not seen the news
A	no well er two days ago people were there doing their Christmas shopping some people left well er lots of people were sort of planning well got into their cars to leave the car park
D	mm
A	at four o'clock
D	yeah
A	they were still there leaving the car park
A	at half past nine
D	no way oh my god
A	and some people were completely hysterical
D	that's a nightmare
A	yeah
D	oh my god
A	I would be desperate for the loo by then actually
C	what caused that?
A	I mean do you remember the time when we stuck at
D	yeah that's horrible enough
A	TK Maxx for about half an hour
D	I thought oh my god
A	yeah
D	cars this is horrible
A	mm
A	but they were stuck for it was six hours
D	oh no that's
A	before
D	such a that's the stuff of nightmares
A	the
D	well what held it up?
A	and to try calm people who were
D	well yeah you would
A	totally
D	that's so they're trapped isn't it?
A	mm like we were
D	could they not get out of their car though?
A	well yes yeah and I suspect that they did I think
C	yeah they could stroll around
A	but then you you hear that the carpark at Bluewater is two hundred and forty acres
D	so
A	that's a hell of a
D	I don't know acres
A	well an acre is
D	it's that big
A	a football pitch is an acre I think so you're talking about
D	yeah
A	two hundred and forty football pitches well talk about
D	well what caused it though?
A	just too many cars were there and you know arriving and leaving at the same time and just gridlocking
D	oh that's so awful
A	mm
D	I've never heard of that happening before
A	and people were sort of saying that the whole car park area and
C	clearly
D	well obviously yes
A	mm
C	nothing
D	so much for just nipping out to do your Christmas shopping
A	mm
D	oh no that would put you off going out for a while wouldn't it?
A	mm
D	and the car
A	well interestingly
C	that's really annoying
A	well it's
C	not useful at all
A	because the M25 had problems but luckily we'd got we passed through an area then created a problem but
C	after what junction?
A	they said no the junctions that are a real problem was the twelve till ten which we use but they were fine when we were there but they were saying
D	well yes I suppose it would be
A	and er you know
D	but I mean that would really traumatise you
A	oh yeah
D	for a long time
A	mm
D	if that happened
A	yeah
D	you'd probably sell your car but it makes you makes public transport look like heaven
A	mm
D	oh no
A	well
D	but then you can't just leave
A	you can't just leave a car actually no
D	people think they can't leave it but on the other hand
A	it would have been towed away and you would have had to pay something
D	on the other hand and and then it would be even more gridlock cos people would
A	well yes yeah
D	have left their car
A	yeah yeah
D	but there would come a point when you'd have to do that really wouldn't you?
A	well
D	if you don't know what's happening
A	if you're sat there for six hours
D	and you don't know when you're gonna get out of it you know?
A	well
D	that's the other thing
A	I suppose you see it would be a long time before the police were called in so
D	yes it would
A	so nobody could tell anybody anything anyway
D	no
A	it's not like there's an
A	cos if there's
D	intercom system
A	yeah mm
D	at least if you're on a train there's an intercom system
A	mm
D	or when you're gonna be moving again
C	alright
B	yeah but are you sure this was? I thought this
C	uhu
B	is there more than one Bluewater?
D	er
B	cos I thought the one they were talking about was in the west of London
D	there's two west what's the one at Stratford called? Westfield
C	mm
D	there's two two Westfields I think there's only one Bluewater
C	well there's one east
B	yes
C	is there a different one?
B	well there's a huge one somewhere in the west of
C	well then there are two
D	well then there are two
C	then there are two cos it's not the one that we could get the bus to if we so were inclined
D	that's the one we keep meaning to get the bus to isn't it?
C	well not keep meaning but
D	well one day
A	well certainly not over Christmas
D	and certainly not yeah
A	mm cos the buses must have been well I suppose the buses wouldn't well they
D	no
A	wouldn't go anywhere near the car park but
D	no
A	all the road system in the area
D	oh
A	was all blocked
A	and if you'd bought things like ice cream it would to put in the freezer
D	that would be that wouldn't it?
A	you know
D	what a disaster
A	yeah
A	and if you'd got
D	oh no what if they had
D	children in the car
A	mm I was gonna say
D	oh no
A	if you've got screaming tots
D	or a baby
A	mm
D	oh yeah
A	you know at at home
D	yeah
A	and cos you're gonna be back at five
D	mm
A	and you don't get there till ten
D	put you off Christmas as well wouldn't it?
A	mm
B	oh
A	oh you did get the wishbone
B	yes
A	that needs to be dried then you can pull it
D	that was delicious
A	mm
D	mainly
C	would anyone like some more?
A	no thank you what do you want some more?
D	there's more gravy and more sprouts if anyone would like those
A	do you want any more?
D	mm
A	there you are
A	mm well he will have chicken
D	we could have a mince pie heated up if you wanted one
A	that would be nice yeah
D	shall we heat some?
A	yeah yeah if yeah
D	yeah
A	I think they're here
D	they're in a tin
A	are they? yeah they're in the red tin aren't they?

D	one of the big ones
A	yeah
C	the one with the
D	dunno
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	yes
D	then you just
A	they were lovely weren't they?
D	yeah we must finish those actually
A	they were good
D	how many each do we want? two?
B	what are they?
D	mince pies
B	yes please
A	two?
D	two?
A	one for me
D	one and two for
B	could be could be lovely mince pie
D	shall I have one or two?
C	have two
D	oh that was nice nice to have er

A	oh yeah
B	splendid
A	he came in after a night of setting up the theatre
B	mm
A	so he arrived here at about four thirty which then had a two or three hours' kip and then er and did this
C	okay darling I'm done here
D	actually no I wanna put some things away so out of the way
C	all that meat we now break into erm for
B	say you didn't say who
A	erm
A	I think
B	no
A	but erm
B	yes
A	three years
B	yes
A	I wonder what she's doing it in
D	that has to be if we edited it
C	Christmas
D	no I mean where we
C	what's this yoghurt for? it's taking up a lot of room
D	sorry
C	the
D	that's this there because sometimes I like a smoothie
C	well that's the worst reason to have something on this Christmas season right I'm done okay
D	okay go and sit down
C	yes
A	fridges are never big enough at this time of
D	no
A	no I mean however big a fridge is it's never big enough
D	no
B	yeah
D	ah he liked that
C	not he's not
A	had your ones at lunchtime did you darling?
B	ah
A	they're they're nice and
B	yeah
A	so
C	mm
C	no he uses a German company called Pieroth or maybe it's Pieroth
B	oh right yeah they do a lot of German
C	it's a Germany company
B	yeah yeah and they've been running years
C	but it's really difficult to check what you're buying on their website because I think they're just used as an intermediary who maybe just buy their own wine
A	he stills gets copious quantities of the stuff really
C	yeah
A	doesn't he?
B	hey
C	give one to
B	millionaire slice
A	mm
B	mum used to make this
A	I did
C	I never had it
C	no
C	never knew never made it in your life however er a schoolboy
A	of which you were one
C	on occasion
A	have you got lights out there? I'm seeing blue lights
D	yes he has
C	that's my keg of beer
D	he decorated his keg of beer
A	oh right
B	oh right
A	that'll be well chilled then
A	that will be well
B	what have you got there
A	should be good
C	your wine you bought yeah
A	and this is the one from
C	it's weird cos it's a Spanish wine but it's written in Portuguese
B	oh really?
C	yeah
B	mm
B	I thought the austere label was quite promising
C	yes
B	this is so good
C	have another one
B	so good
C	we need to finish them
A	thirteen and a half percent
C	that's a lot for a red these days
A	mm yeah
A	so tell me the meeting when you and
C	it had already been negotiated
A	when?
C	over the phone
A	oh right
C	with
A	thousand right
B	there's been much debate about that down in
A	yeah
B	first of all with
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	well I mean to say they're just
A	pardon?
C	why it occurred to
A	yeah
C	just Scottish that's all I can put it down to
A	but
C	it doesn't make any sense from any angle
A	yeah
A	but
B	such a sum was
A	well we
A	he's what?
A	oh he's
C	yeah
A	oh yeah I was saying he was
C	well when I was there it was none of my business so I didn't
A	you thought
C	advised someone in their late seventies with an incurable degenerative disease to invest a windfall in a five-year locked down account?
A	yeah well you see
C	they probably did that
D	no but it wouldn't it have been
C	I I er verbally yes but on instruction
D	well they might not even have met
C	no I I'm sure most of it would have been negotiated over the phone
D	with
A	oh really?
D	well cos if uncle
C	yeah because you don't wanna trawl in
D	they wouldn't even understand what he says
A	yeah well
D	so he would
C	but
A	but I mean there's just no
C	of course he will be
A	yeah but pardon? he will
C	of course he will be
D	well
A	he's about the only person who would
D	you know who's gonna you know who's gonna benefit from it
C	MS only knocks off about
A	yes
C	five six years off your life expectancy so what it will what's the life expectancy for a male UK male then? early eighties?
A	well you I mean five years
C	it's about that
A	takes them to there yeah
C	but and and then the point is the irony well not it's an irony at the end of that five years you've got fifty grand more but so what?
A	yeah but how do you?
C	you've had three hundred and something anyway plus you've had another
A	yeah
C	I think maybe it was predicated then on the fact that he knew he was getting more than that immediately
A	yeah so
C	and was hoping he will spend
A	well well and I'm and I'm hoping he will get
C	yeah he'll get it it's just being held up by the taxman
A	yeah but you know that's a
C	well his salary is thirty-seven thousand per annum
B	really?
C	before tax but that's three erm
A	pensions
C	three pensions
B	oh right
B	wow
C	the
A	what's the
C	erm
A	oh right
C	and his state pension
A	yeah oh right
A	that's a lot more or vastly more than our combined
C	why what's your is your pension a private one?
A	our total pension for both of us is just over twenty-five thousand is that right?
C	per annum?
B	around about
A	yeah
A	yes
C	what's the tax rate on a pension? cos it won't be income tax will it? or is it?
A	well there is yeah but but I pay income tax
C	it's like capital gains I think
A	well yeah I I don't I pay income tax on my little earnings
C	yeah but what's your earnings?
A	I get a well I last year I earned seven hundred pounds
C	do you fill in a tax return form?
A	no
C	well then how do you get taxed?
D	well no you'll pay PAYE that one won't it?
A	that
D	yeah
C	yeah but if you're already paying that should be tax that shouldn't be taxed anyway it's not enough
A	well I well I that but that's what I thought
D	no it shouldn't be
C	the threshold is like twelve
D	the threshold is ten er it's
A	well I I thought so I mean
A	yeah
C	well you should be pocketing every penny of it
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	other than erm
A	I maybe I should be
D	I don't
C	well if you're over the age if you're over the retirement age would you still actually contribute to the what's it called
D	what National Insurance contributions?
C	yeah I think you probably would wouldn't you?
D	maybe
C	that would be the only tax coming out though National Insurance I reckon there wouldn't be any income tax
A	no
D	I don't think there should be unless you were doing a tax return and everything else was taken into account
C	there isn't everything else
D	oh there isn't an everything else is there?
A	no that's our
C	well it would be erm
A	that's our er the rest is just pensions oh
D	er which is already
A	mm
D	you don't pay tax on pensions do you?
C	you do yeah
D	or am I being incredibly stupid?
C	you do yes
D	do you?
C	that's what they said in the bank
A	but yes it would what a a shame that you weren't able to ask this fellow because you know he would it should be
C	it wasn't the chap who advised him we were in that chap's office
A	but he wasn't there
C	but he wasn't it wasn't that chap
C	kind of annoyingly whoever it was was with his supervisor I think cos he was training more than they thought this might be tricky or they might have thought it might be tricky I don't know
D	though it's weird that one moment
C	and there were two of them
D	he's got all that money and then
A	seeing
C	yeah
A	right
D	the next he's taken out a loan
A	when when he when he took put that
C	when I arrived with him
A	oh well yeah oh right
C	but he was introduced as this is my supervisor who's just gonna sit here
A	yeah ah
C	I didn't know if he was a junior he was like in his twenties
A	yeah
C	er five
A	five percent?
C	or five point two
A	yeah
C	he's got to repay eighteen grand obviously so
A	yeah in in what period of time?
C	er I can't remember
A	a year or
A	oh right just
C	thirty-two months or something like that
A	yeah yeah
C	but if he gets the windfall within the next two weeks he can just cancel it
A	yeah
C	otherwise you've got a penalty to pay
A	yeah well well that's not a huge amount sixty days is it?
C	no and it's much less than the two grand if he waited
A	uhu uhu
D	thirtieth
A	and when does he come back?
D	about the fifth
A	sixth?
D	about the fifth?
A	fifth?
C	the bones? no
A	that's a whole week
C	yeah
A	and are you gonna be at
