B	yeah
C	yeah
A	eighty for the big one
B	yeah
A	and then
B	that's clean
A	erm
A	there's not that much difference actually in prices of the actual print to that one
B	fifty-five pounds?
A	yeah
B	but
A	but the frames were slightly different
B	it was fifty-five pounds before we had the
A	okay
B	before we had the gallery
A	right
B	and they're thirty-three percent
D	that's not Darjeeling
B	no it's no that's not
D	that's Darjeeling
A	call it what ever you like can't you?

B	yeah
D	the space between
B	space between
A	mm yeah
B	the space between?
A	yeah
B	right um
D	yeah cos it's the little holes that make it isn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	otherwise it wouldn't be anything
A	it's amazing isn't it?
D	yeah
B	so you reckon this one eighty pounds? Mum?
A	yes I think so
B	is that enough to give you a cut and to give the gallery a cut and to give us
A	we don't want a cut
B	yeah you do
A	well you can pay for the frame
D	yeah
A	it's about fourteen pound for the frame
B	but you did all the work
A	well that it that doesn't matter
B	well it does
A	you can pay for the frame if you want
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah definitely pay for the frame and a little bit for you
D	yeah
A	yeah it's not a yeah but I don't know how
B	not a lot is it?
A	I think we take their advice as well because
D	yeah
A	they might have a totally different idea to us anyway
D	yeah
A	mightn't they?
B	yeah
D	right well how much was the frame? Seventeen pounds
A	I think they were about fourteen the frames of those
D	fourteen?
C	yeah
A	they were thirteen ninety-nine
D	and how much were the prints?
A	erm the print
B	and then the card
D	and the card
C	and the putting them in
D	and putting them in
B	yeah
C	and cutting it all
D	and cutting it all
B	yeah well we'll pay you for that
C	oh no
B	no well I think you should
D	no but that should be all in the cost shouldn't it
B	that should be in the cost
C	oh I see
B	could you get me a knife?
D	you've gotta put the hours of labour into it as well
B	oh I'll get it
C	yeah but I mean that isn't too bad once we've once we knew how to do it that was quite easy actually
D	yeah?
C	that's cos we've bought all the cutters and everything
B	La
C	let me get you a better knife than that cos that's a butter knife that'll that'll snap
B	oh
A	the actual print is well six-fifty plus erm two ninety-nine postage
B	so ten pounds for the print okay
D	and fourteen
B	that's twenty-five pounds and then the paper
D	yeah
A	mm
B	thirty something pounds to produce
A	mm
B	thank you
A	seventy for the smaller ones
B	seventy for the smaller
A	I don't think it's much much different really is it now?
C	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well the frames are slightly cheaper that's all really
C	yeah
A	mm
D	why are you taking that out?
B	I want to write one of ten on the back cos apparently before you
D	yeah
B	oh
C	what's the matter
B	no it's alright I'll just do this
C	are we having a cup of tea before you go?
A	yeah
B	yes yes please
C	I'll put the kettle on then
A	mm
B	well this is exciting innit mum? We're sort of like real artists for the day
A	I know it is
B	we we were saying though we could
A	I've got this awful feeling we'll come back thinking oh
B	we could turn up and they say oh well we haven't got time today to look at them
D	yeah the tiger's brilliant
B	yeah?
A	I don't like it now I've looked at it again
D	that's amazing that is
A	oh
B	all the more reason to sell it then
A	yes it is
B	whereas Polperro you want to keep forever don't you?
A	I do quite like Polperro
B	huh?
A	I do quite like Polperro
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	but I I'm quite I'm happy for anything to go now really
D	yeah well it's better than
A	Cos I think I'm progressing on now like once I start again
B	yeah
B	well we don't have to worry about the danger of popping it now
A	no we don't
D	okay so what are we calling them? What are we calling that one? Darjeeling?
B	can you write it all down for me?
D	calling that one The Space Between
A	but I think that I think they will say they want they would sell it more than seventy
D	yeah
A	Cos they if they want their thirty percent they would the higher the price the more the money they get don't they?
D	yeah
B	you were right
A	yeah?
B	yeah yeah say
A	it's true isn't it?
B	yeah
A	well I think that the paperwork would do for twenty pound
D	yeah
B	well they asked us for for approximate costs for them
D	oh did they?
B	yeah
D	hmm
B	erm
D	well as long as you know how much it cost to produce them then
B	well that's what I need to write down
D	yeah
B	I I can't remember
D	Cos there's no point  there's no point  driving all that way for like a fiver profit
B	no
D	yeah exactly
C	you what?
B	that's the thing you don't realise do you how much
D	it's quite difficult selling art isn't it
B	yeah you don't realise how
C	yeah
B	well actually we haven't put very much work in
D	like cos your mum's embroidery like how many hours did she take?
B	that's not embroidery that's textile art
D	well textiles
B	well there's maybe some embroidery I don't know
D	well it's textiles yeah
B	look at that cos it's coming right off the page look
D	yeah but how many hours?
B	I know that's why we we're selling that for five five-ninety
D	do you know what I mean you
B	no they don't they just look
D	like even if you think minimum wage
B	yeah
D	you know a hundred hours probably
B	I've lost my vinegar
D	A hundred hours at minimum wage is like six hundred quid
B	because because it's like a hobby she forgets how long she's spent on it so she can
D	yeah
B	and cos they've always been used to having
D	what?
B	I'm gonna have to open it
D	what are we calling this one?
B	I don't know but look at  look at  that damage there
D	oh is that inside?
