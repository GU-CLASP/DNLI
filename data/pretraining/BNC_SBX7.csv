A	yeah
B	the amount of people who come for job interviews and have got the most ridiculous email addresses
B	why would you ever?
A	that's really funny
A	that's so funny
A	I guess it's because you just erm
B	yes
A	oh dear

A	er I'm just putting the stuff
B	okay
A	but read it read out right
B	I am responsible dedicated and trustworthy and will be totally committed to any task or project I undertake either working on my own initiative or as part of a team I have an outgoing friendly personality I work well under pressure and consider myself to be patient kind and understanding
A	great

A	and then I guess just in your then in your
B	I'm just gonna do save
A	that's really good mum
B	mm
A	erm
B	what? do you think that should go in my personal profile?
A	I think so cos I think that's important
B	maybe that should come though in my company cos you know when you cos every job you apply for
A	you write a covering letter
B	you have to put like a little statement thing
A	yeah that's true that's true
B	so that would be you know
A	yeah I think but I think you should point that out cos I think it's really important that you've like
B	mm
A	I think it's like yeah like something about like I've got erm an unusually broad
B	mm
A	in my working career
B	what erm?
A	and then then you just like I dunno cos like
A	and the public sector
B	yeah industry and public sector
B	yeah
A	have won is it is it did Ofsted
B	yeah
A	rate it outstanding?
B	yeah every time they every time they've come
A	well definitely point that out for an Ofsted
B	but
A	definitely
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos you've got like you've basically got all the soft skills of being good with people and empathetic
B	if I wasn't so old perhaps someone might
A	no
B	jump erm
A	for Christ's sake
B	jump at the chance
A	you're such a wazz
B	ah
A	I would erm
B	I've done I've yeah I've put that the organising and participating in a wide variety of extracurricular trips both day and residential
A	but I think like something about like
B	so that would be
A	erm so er I've been I've been recognised within the department for always going above and beyond
B	mm
A	like being you've been recognised for er always going out of my way erm
B	so what do you call it though? if we're going above and beyond
A	erm
B	so I've been I've received recognition for my
A	erm
B	efforts of
A	for
B	for my commitment which goes beyond
A	my job description often
B	yeah
A	often investing large large amounts of my of my personal time and resources
B	okay I've received recognition for my
A	I think all those things are super-important
B	yeah I mean they're they're things that perhaps because I know they perhaps they don't seem particularly special to me but
A	yeah no no but that's like the fact is that Ofsted rated
B	yeah just I need someone that's why it's good to have you there
A	yeah
B	because erm yeah
A	and I think you should say in your covering letter that just that thing about like so do you think it is like you've got like a
A	you know?
B	so erm I've received recognition for my dedication often going beyond
A	erm
B	the something of my job description the
A	remit?
B	yeah
A	the remit of my job description
A	okay I'm gonna meet
B	okay so we'll make a move in a minute then shall we?
A	no I no I have to leave now
A	er
B	or do you not go from there?
A	yeah I will go to go from
B	okay
A	erm but if I if you run me up to
B	oh right okay
A	yeah?
B	yeah so if we leave here then
A	so if we leave here about five to?
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah cos we don't know what the traffic will be like
A	about half an hour
B	yeah okay
A	erm
B	really?
A	cos then it means I can cycle
B	yeah
A	let's put the money back in that jar actually
B	oh
A	what?
B	what are you like?
B	should my CV go on to three pages? is that alright?
A	yes er can you shrink it down a bit?
B	yeah I might have to actually
A	if you don't the
B	or four pages four pages
A	if you make the margins
B	yeah I don't I'll just gonna do save cos I don't need anything
A	okay go back to your layout
B	yeah and then just make the
A	and then go
B	margins small
A	and to make them narrow
B	like that
A	yeah
B	that's better
A	but it's still
B	yeah I know but I can
A	okay
B	erm
A	also mum just thinking
B	mm?
A	erm maybe in here if you're applying for kinda the arts-based ones you need to say something
B	mm
A	about being creative
B	yeah
A	erm I am creative erm
B	mm
A	like I'm a part-time artist and I'm highly creative
B	yeah yeah
A	maybe that should be your final sentence
B	creativity is my middle name
A	you know what I mean? it is I I'm an artist
B	yeah
A	I'm an artist comfortable working in erm most media
B	so I work well under pressure and consider myself intelligent kind and understanding
A	I'd just put it as the final sentence
B	erm
A	I'm a part-time artist
B	no I've just you just need to put about creative erm
B	well I am but they can see that when they read it but if if
A	yeah do you have do you have a section on your
B	I am artistic and creative
A	yeah
B	that's it
A	have you got all your have you got your cartoon stuff in the background?
B	no
A	you need to I would put that as present
B	what do you mean?
A	so from like maybe
B	mm?
A	cartoon artist paid private paid commissions
B	if I take these little things out here if I take that out there
A	I definitely would have a whole
B	that's alright yeah so that's brought it onto two
A	you could take it down what font is it?
B	I don't know
A	what font size?
B	eleven
A	oh you could definitely take it down to ten
B	could I?
A	yeah I'd take it down to font size ten and then I'd put in an extra paragraph after
B	erm
A	but I'd make that a whole separate thing that'd be it'd be your second one
B	brought it on to three pages now so that's good
A	but now you're about to put it back up again
B	huh?
A	now you're about to put it back up again
B	what do you mean?
A	if you put in go up
B	erm
A	and have
B	yeah okay or perhaps I could put that in here though I'm artistic
A	no no because if you put it in under employment it's cos it is mum it's like it's like
B	mm
A	and it is kinda weighty enough that it should be I think you should
B	so what in here?
A	I'd put a
B	okay
A	and say over
B	mm yeah okay and take a picture of the wall here as well
A	yeah and like er
B	yeah
A	blah-blah-blah
B	yeah yeah yeah will

A	and then do you want me to have a? do you want? is it helpful to have a read through
B	what this?
