A	yeah so which one do you think is going to be the best for the blog then?
B	that would be this one
A	mm
B	well
A	okay
B	mm
A	there's also MacMillan
B	yeah and you can test these things
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	on the subject of small talk
B	yeah
A	when I'm when I'm a bit more kind of into it
B	to start with I wonder whether Macmillan Macmillan's the right type of site?
A	yeah but
B	and so do people buy books straight from their site?
A	the guest blog is just about small talk
B	mm mm I know that
A	yeah
B	so you want to put it in front of an audience?
A	and well yeah I see what you are saying so what kind of direct direct sales would you say would come from Tumblr? was it push it to Amazon? or how does it click through?
B	well the intention would be
A	mm
B	erm so people read the blog click through that goes to a website
A	mm
B	which then advertises the book and site that talks about small talk
A	yeah so it's really it's a you know
B	and then people click through from that site
A	and you are also having to advertise on Amazon too to get people to Amazon
B	yeah
A	which is part of the way it works
B	yeah you don't want to be writing something and advertising
A	ah right so how do you do it instead?
B	you do the click through to your website which provides extra valuable information
A	oh so you have to have a website
B	yeah
A	oh right oh
B	so
A	and does that mean that people can also order a erm a hard copy too
B	at the moment because of the erm the arrangement with Amazon you can't you can't sell directly from your website
A	mm
B	yeah so if we had a different arrangement you could
A	right
B	so
A	mm
B	and you may decide down the track that you take the book off there and you sell it directly from your own website or something
A	okay so as long as you're
B	yes that's it that's the thing
A	mm mm so
A	Amazon how they
B	no they have a massive resource centre behind them
A	do they?
B	mm
A	so there's people you can even contact and say look I don't really understand how to do this bit and they would get back to you?
B	yeah that's right
A	oh okay
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and they are selling you the idea that you can publish your stuff on this site
A	mm mm
B	and sell your products through them or whatever yeah
A	mm mm
B	so the other day I was listening to a podcast where this guy was saying how erm
A	oh right
B	so this guy was seeking advice
A	yeah
B	about
A	mm
B	should should they do this? should they be erm they don't have to worry about the hassle they basically supply Amazon with the product and Amazon does all of the
A	mm
B	right
A	mm mm
B	so the feedback to this guy was well
A	mm
B	so then what control do you then have? yeah
A	yeah
B	so as good a deal as it might be it takes a lot of the hassle out of the business and all that kind of thing the major part of it is that Amazon end up with your customers
A	mm
B	so that that isn't a great idea you know
A	no
B	now there might be another situation where you as a
A	mm mm
B	and then Amazon pitches to you well
A	mm
B	with your customers but in fact they're not your customers they are Amazon's customers who happen to buy your products that you're providing through Amazon's platform store
A	yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	and that you would then
A	yeah
B	now if they're Amazon's customers Amazon has that data you will only have that if you have got to ship stuff to them if you don't ship stuff to them then how do you get hold of that data?
A	mm I see
B	yeah it is good
A	mm
B	well tonight we are having a chat about that
A	oh yeah
B	erm
A	yep
B	for for for the weekend
A	mm mm so who do you think will be hanging out?
B	well there's a couple of people who have been involved in setting it up so they're there
A	mm mm
B	I haven't really checked out who else has kind of put their hand up to say they would be going along
A	oh right
B	like going along to this hang out tonight
A	oh right okay but there's more
B	yeah and then there's erm over twenty people who have
A	and how long do you think you will go for?
B	well I've I had a look at kind of return flights and Sunday Monday are very expensive so I was thinking about popping back on Tuesday
A	mm mm
B	but erm I got in touch with
A	oh
B	for me to stay so I am going to share a place with some of the people for the Thursday Friday and Saturday
A	oh god
B	I'm kind of surprised there's only like one person based in

B	and he's in this group and then well there's one person in the group that's placed in
A	mm
