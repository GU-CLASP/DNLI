B	he has
C	so how long how long were you there for?
A	a good few hours I was after I called you what time did I call you?
C	a few hours? what what well why?
A	I told you I was with a trainee and he
C	mm
A	first of all wrote up notes so they they they just write a witness statement don't they? but the thing is
C	I don't know I've never done it
A	but the thing is he didn't want to get it wrong so he had to make notes first and then from his notes he had to then write up the witness statement and it took him ages to write the witness statement up
C	oh
A	and I couldn't leave until he had wrote the witness statement
C	in the same room with you or did he go away and do it?
B	did you sign it?
A	I was in the same room with him
C	oh so it wasn't like going over and over it?
A	no
C	he didn't ask you to repeat it?
A	so I spoke about what happened
C	yeah
A	he wrote notes
C	yeah
A	and then after he'd wrote the notes
C	had they already got a?
A	statement
B	mm
C	right had they already got your CCTV footage in front of them?
A	erm
B	somewhere anyway
A	they had it on a disc yeah
B	yes
C	they had it
B	it won't be cold because
C	cos they so they had a clear picture of her and they had a picture of her attempting to assault you?
B	it carries on cooking
A	erm
C	there was so that that was have you got a camera at the front of your shop then that caught her?
A	no no
C	well which camera?
A	it wasn't very good just cameras everywhere but they are very blurred and very they are not accurate
C	no well cameras never are but they
A	yeah
C	that was clear on it?
A	we didn't see that in front of the he didn't watch that though when I was there
C	but you know it's on there because you've seen it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	oh I haven't seen it
B	you was there at the time
C	yes but I thought that that you would have watched your CCTV back at the shop
A	no I didn't
C	why not?
A	I don't know I didn't have time
C	who who has watched it?
B	well only because you know the experience so you know what happened
C	yeah but so they the police have asked for that tape?
A	yep
C	oh I see
B	so your your statement'll back up what happened there so it's fine
A	and all I've done is just take I've just got pictures on my phone
C	and your dad reckons you should be telling
A	I told
B	good that's good
C	that you were going to the police station?
B	yeah
C	and what did she have to say about it?
A	thanks for telling me
C	yeah
A	I don't know they go there all the time apparently
C	what reporting crime?
A	yeah
C	oh
B	I don't know
A	stop people crashing
C	oh
A	yeah I heard that
B	mm so I don't know whether that means
C	putting
A	white stuff
B	some sort of er deer
C	oh British Deer Society oh okay
B	I suppose there's been deers going on the road which is what happens isn't it people crash into them and cause accidents
C	mm
B	so
A	yeah
B	okay that's
A	like I say it was just dragged out
B	whether they'll catch her or not who knows? but er
A	I was asking what will happen to her if they catch her
C	oh yeah
A	they said she will go to prison now
B	right
A	she must be a known offender
C	she might already have been a known offender when they they didn't know who she was they didn't they couldn't tell from
A	they didn't tell me that
C	she might they might do a Crimewatch series on it you know they do Crimewatch when they re-enact
A	oh
C	yeah the police database the police will know
A	yeah and like I say they have got intelligence that work in the
B	yeah yeah they'll
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah yeah
C	they'll be monitoring it
A	yeah like I say I don't know who they probably won't come
C	you'd recognise her if she came in the store again though would you?
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	you see the thing is she'll probably go somewhere else now another centre I mean Dudley or Sheffield or Manchester
C	well
A	no
C	you didn't think did you?
A	even the policeman said they just buy the they just steal them to buy drugs so he was very narrow-minded like you said
C	oh well he's in the job he knows did you tell him where he may get the drugs?
A	mum
A	no
B	no
C	no good for you they were nice policemen were they?
A	yeah
C	they knew you were new to this?
A	I guess so yeah
C	they treated you nicely?
A	okay one of them just didn't really talk because he was too stressed I think
B	because he'd taken
C	you didn't have to walk past rows of prisoners which was your worry?
A	no no
C	no cells no people
A	I didn't see anybody criminal wise
B	good
C	no criminals how would you have recognised one?
A	no no I didn't see any
C	good
B	when I was standing for Boots erm
A	yes
B	for treatment so whether they are on drugs
C	oh really?
B	or whatever or they are there they they have come for their medication or whatever they they walk into the er into the hospital or the pharmacist

C	oh well they'd be bringing them from there because
B	well you've heard of
C	oh
B	and
C	mm

B	they look rough obviously
C	you reckon it's the young offenders institute? for young people
B	I don't know whether it's them I only see ever see young people come in there
A	mm
B	so I don't know whether whether they might be
C	mm
A	is that the closest prison to here?
C	probably yes
B	to here yes
C	I was gonna otherwise erm the Birmingham prisons they go to Birmingham hospitals that's why I was surprised when he said
A	like you say it was

A	he does want people to go I
B	I'm asking I'm asking if anybody wants to go I'm going but I don't know whether if anyone else is coming
B	are you?
C	mm
D	mm well I said I
B	which one?
D	Virgin I was going to go this morning
B	oh
C	how's that working out with the membership? because I thought it was cancelled when you left
D	mm
A	it was
B	what's the deal?
C	well what what happened there?
D	well it's not
B	oh
C	oh right so you haven't got a card to get through with
A	he just wings it
C	they they they think they think you're a member still
D	yes
C	oh well
D	yes well I've I've never technically been a member I'm just a
C	mm
D	hanger on
C	somebody they know
B	just think if we all did that
A	yeah
D	mm
C	if you go regularly
B	back to the old train journey again
C	it's
D	yeah it's true yeah well
B	I mean
C	everybody gets stuff for free if they can crikey
D	but
A	there's a new manager isn't there?
D	I think so so you've got to take in a wage slip
C	have you got some old ones you're gonna re-date?
D	yeah but they they never open it up and check the date because that would be a bit
C	mm mm
D	invasive wouldn't it? to start looking at my payslips
B	you you
C	so what what do you show them an envelope?
D	yeah just the envelope that says obviously it's a
C	oh wow
B	ah good
D	some of them say can I see your driving licence to match up with it? and
C	oh right
B	can you get me a new phone and?
D	yeah
A	he doesn't even work for
C	oh I erm viewed my bill online today which I never normally do
B	ah dear
C	I thought I'll have a look at this cos I had erm a a couple of texts right this will make this I I thought what is this yesterday
B	who has?
D	okay
C	from your next bill date you will pay the erm plan charge in full remember to use
D	mm
A	obviously they've got
C	obviously taken friends and family into it then ten ninety-nine there was a thirty-seven pence for some random photo I thought well I am not going to query that and then erm
D	so is ten ninety-nine is that forty percent? or is that just
C	well I don't know what it is but no no it's
B	it's half what
A	ten ninety-nine
C	that's actually more than forty percent because my I'm sure she told me my bill was going to be twenty-one ninety-nine they've now applied a discount ten ninety-nine
A	for an Iphone six
C	so I was very pleased with that
B	which is half of what we were paying
C	yes so obviously querying it you know because
A	I thought you told me you didn't tell her it was finished
C	no no I yeah I did no when I phoned her I said to her in good faith my friends and family discount erm apparently has been is going to be cancelled from today because I got the year wrong
B	two thousand sixteen
A	yeah
C	gonna be cancelled from today
C	she said erm no she said well yeah but it it is expensive she goes it it varies at EE from week to week she goes you can have a really good deal one week and the next week it's slashed and the following week it's doubled again
A	is that true?
D	mm not really
C	and it followed by we are not supposed to do this and we wouldn't do it for anybody else you know the standard line but for you
A	in store
D	I seem to remember her coming in
C	well I did I sort of remembered going in I did go in didn't I? I remembered that so I said in store so that was right then was there another question I just thought crikey anyway so after she'd asked me all of that and then she talked to me
C	did she ask me a?
C	don't think I don't think she I don't think she asked me a password on this one because I wouldn't know what the password was
B	you might not even had one
C	but it was the way she said she said think carefully
A	I've definitely got one but
C	because if you get it wrong we have to take your first answer and if it's wrong we have to end the call
B	pretty easy then
C	I know anyway
B	prove you are not that person or you are that person surely
C	I said to her
A	does she know what phone you've got?
C	I said I'd got a Iphone six I told her all this I I was being quite upfront I thought my you know it was all expiring so she said well I I I can put you down to twenty-one ninety-nine I said so that's
C	I I think we are on different wavelengths
D	mm
C	anyway there we are logged into the account ten ninety-nine plus Vat
B	do that again and it'll
C	so
B	it will be down to five quid like mum
A	well yeah
D	I think yes it's worked out really good
C	so it was worth well it was worth a phone I am just saying it was worth a phone call
D	I'm still a bit sceptical though I I wouldn't hold your breath but I'd see what your next bill comes in at
C	oh okay alright then
D	because I don't know what incentive she'd have to there's no obvious incentive or commission for her to save you money if you are tied into a contract I don't know why she would
A	but
C	it's been twelve I'm half way in aren't I? she was
A	me and me
D	mm
C	why are you eating that with your finger? that's disgusting
A	we have and I know what you mean about there's no incentive for them and I know you've worked there but we I've I've always got my phone and then you got yours lowered as well
C	because what's
D	yeah but if you if you found an Iphone six for twenty-two pounds a month you couldn't find that on the internet anywhere that's impossible
C	no no I I was completely happy with the deal don't get me wrong and when she said twenty-one ninety-nine I thought well that's more or less what I'm but I'm happy I'm really happy with the deal
D	mm
D	I'm er yeah I'm a bit sceptical yeah no I think yeah it's it's worked out really well but I think there's no way I could
A	yeah but there's something else behind the the background he thinks
C	well I but I also said now so what's to stop me cancelling my direct debits? I can't afford this price so she put it up to forty-one cancelling it
D	yeah but you'll get a bad credit rating you won't be able to get any finance
C	well I did say that yeah
D	you'd get a erm a county court judgement against you and everything they are pretty they are pretty harsh
C	oh would you? you would right okay
A	I'll be doing witnesses about you
C	well I well I I I wondered that and I the first thing I said
B	no no no no
C	to to your dad on the
D	people
C	seriously?
D	really really really
D	took a phone contract out on behalf of someone's name
C	oh you told me that yeah and it didn't yeah yeah
D	and defaulted
C	well I'm I'm amazed but that telling me this month it's thirteen pounds
D	mm
C	something
D	very good
A	yeah
C	that's why I'm amazed also I got through straight because when you
A	has it come out then that thirteen pounds?
C	it's coming out on the eighth it said but when when you when you phone up I did the one five 0 and and and it rang and it said erm yeah you are in a queue if you would like to pay fifty P we can reprioritise to the top of the queue I thought as you can wait a long wait and then they answered straightaway
C	and
D	mm
C	you know cos
D	was it the retentions department or was it just general customer service?
A	general
C	one five 0 I don't I don't know whatever
A	that's what we always used to call
C	I just done one five 0 and got through to speaking to a person
A	before I had friends and family discount with you I I wasn't paying full
D	yes but
A	I was always paying the discounted price
D	you'd never ever ever have got an Iphone six for twenty-two pounds it's just not
A	I reckon if I call mine up today
C	no no you wouldn't would you?
A	if I if I call them up tonight I reckon they'll put it down
D	I bet you
A	I put it
D	try it
A	shall I call them and see?
C	you should do because
A	I hope it doesn't mess up my friends and family though
B	well it sounds
C	well that I I didn't
A	it will mess it up won't it?
D	yours will because yours is from someone that's gonna be in the company for quite a while so I wouldn't do it with yours really but
C	ah
D	I think it's really good and I think it's
C	somebody who's in the company for a while
A	because I'm not on
D	yeah
C	well like I say I genuinely believed it was running out on that day because this this all this was done before I spoke to you
D	yeah yeah
C	on on Saturday night if I'd have spoken to you on Saturday night and I'd have read that I'd have gone oh that's fine
C	I only did it because I thought I was going up to forty-two pounds a month that was the only reason for doing it
D	mm
C	and now to come down to that so but I won't have affected anybody because that was that one was given to you by some guy that was leaving wasn't it? and you've got a a last
D	oh no not at all not at all
C	yeah yeah
B	did she go away in erm?
C	but is it in your name though? is it in your?
D	it is now yeah it transferred over because I owed him one so
C	to to to your name but
D	it's complicated how it works
C	but I you know all I said was I I'm losing it and I can't afford this price she went oh yes it's it's showing us forty-one or whatever on your account I'll put it down to this then that text came through a day later two days later saying your friends and family discount has been set up
D	it's it's yeah it's weird I
C	but I thought well let's just see what happens to that for a little while erm but if I'd have spoken to you and
C	I though
C	I thought well okay that
D	I know you are busy but
C	yeah no I thought I thought well that might work for you I thought but I actually can't afford to pay full price for a year or I don't really want to pay a full price for a year so it was
B	well you usually sit on the line for ages waiting so you give up
C	yeah
D	I think it's yeah
C	so let's see
D	fingers crossed it's fooled them off but it just baffles me how it's happened and why it's happened that a general customer service
C	but it says
D	maybe it was her last day and she felt generous or something
C	no who
B	she er wanted a
C	it was the fact
D	yeah easily done because obviously twenty-seventh was the same day as it just I mean that is just pure coincidence
C	twenty-seventh was the was the day it came through so I yeah I thought so I didn't even read the year and then yesterday so that that was when on Saturday so then on Monday they came through back to back
A	dad have you still got no yoghurts?
B	yoghurts
A	okay yeah
B	I'll see how much I've got
C	after I'd already changed my plan I thought
D	and then once this one
D	okay
C	and then I thought oh so I logged on
D	is that the same bill date as normal?
C	is it the eighth of the month is that the same?
B	I can't remember how to do this?
C	well shall I log onto my bill?
D	yeah let's have a look
B	don't er
C	so hang on we've just got half half an hour of new
D	yeah
C	sorry we couldn't find this page
D	I think you need to flick onto your 4G to erm makes it easier to log in sometimes
C	oh does it? oh hang on it's
D	yeah
B	yes so you start querying things and they look into it a bit further
C	does that say I can't
D	yes
D	even at twenty-two it's
C	well for yeah for an Iphone six
D	that's crazy
D	I think it refreshed
C	oh I see oh right okay so oh so it refreshed so it says extra charge nothing but it had it had thirty-seven P on that earlier so has it
D	yeah it must be this is the new bill now I guess
C	oh so can you see the last one?
D	yeah I'll just er no
C	what happened then?
D	something unexpected happened
B	so you are now paying
D	yeah
C	you see so yeah because this
B	we've not made in error
C	earlier it's changed it because earlier today it had the thirty-seven P and the bill itemised that it had that one itemised but
B	yeah it's fine looking
C	obviously this one
B	previous bill
C	oh
D	your monthly plan ten ninety-nine
C	yeah ten ninety-nine so it's put that thirty-seven whatever that is and and and put the Vat on
B	your contract will terminate in ten days
D	yeah
C	have you phoned
A	no
C	oh oh yes because you are on a different person mm
B	how much do you pay again?
A	twenty-eight pounds
C	you pay more than me cos you have more erm allowance and you have  bigger data allowance
A	yeah
D	I don't know how this has happened I think
C	are you impressed with that?
A	if if I call them up I'd get discount I don't know why this is what we used to do all the time
B	I pay
D	yes but this is
A	honestly
D	okay
D	why didn't you do it last month then?
A	huh?
D	why didn't you do it last month then?
A	I don't know why I just thought
D	why didn't you do it a month after you took out your contract?
A	I just thought I wouldn't do it because we're on friends and family on it
C	because we we were all happy with the friends and the family we were thinking we obviously we're getting a good deal because we are on that but now
A	yeah
D	really good very impressive
C	so
A	go on mum
C	like I say completely by
D	yes it it says your plan is meant to be twenty-one ninety-nine
C	oh it says that? oh okay
D	and then you've got your friends and family
C	there we are so
D	but maybe because she's removed it now it'll come off next month I don't know
C	well no because the email said they'd just set it up
D	mm
C	the email said your friends and family are set up for it
D	it's weird isn't it?
C	and because the friends and family doesn't end now until twenty-seventeen I'm hoping this will go on for twelve months
D	no it looks it looks good it looks like it's fine
B	what are you gonna do with the extra tenner?
C	so does that does that bill when where did you get that? where did you where were you looking for that?
D	er I just went to view bill
C	and it does it give you every call you've made and every text and every?
D	and then I've downloaded the PDF
C	oh I see oh okay
D	yeah
C	well not that I want to see exactly
B	it's still more expensive than my four pound ninety-eight
C	I'm not interested
B	it's the same
C	oh yeah well you've come down because you've got an older phone which is fair enough now
A	dad said what are you going to do with the extra tenner?
C	me? I'm already playing the Postcode Lottery with it which he's which he's up in arms about
A	you are playing the Postcode Lottery?
C	yeah
B	not up in arms I just said I wouldn't do it I said
C	I don't care you are not doing it you can buy your own ticket if you want it I'm doing it for twelve months
A	twelve months?
C	yes
B	yeah twelve months
C	and if I win the twenty-five thousand pounds I was going to send take you all on holiday but with that attitude I'm not taking any of you now
D	no it's I wouldn't
C	you and your
C	we're going to Florida
D	yes
B	he hasn't dissed it either
C	he hasn't dissed it
A	everyone else has
D	is it just like the normal lottery? is it is it just a pound or two or is it?
A	how much is it?
C	ten pounds a month and you get
A	ten pounds a month
B	two pound a week or something
C	you get erm yeah well that's the lottery ticket you get lots of chances to win
C	ah are you dissing it?
D	no
C	you are this close to getting off the list for Florida
B	they do support some
A	ten pounds a month
B	they do support some local charities
A	so you are gonna spend a hundred and twenty pound er a hundred and twenty?
C	yes it supports charities
B	for only
C	in a year
B	only twenty-seven P
C	well I've just I've just saved that on my phone bill
A	yeah what's the point in saving it if you are just going to give it away?
C	I'm not giving it away I'm playing er a game where I may win
B	a cert
A	yeah a dead end
C	I just thought I would just for a bit gives to charities doesn't it?
D	go and play two P slot machines instead
C	I used to like those this is my only way of this is my
A	oh for god's sake
C	do you want me to cancel it now? would it make you all feel a lot happier if I saved ten pounds?
A	I'd rather you go to work
C	she's a cheeky whatsit
C	really
A	I'm only joking
C	I'm sending your dad to Scotland next week
A	dad's going to Scotland
D	what are you going to Scotland for?
C	to work
A	look at his face
B	to get some haggis
C	no to work because we need some money
A	you're going up next week
C	yes
B	too late
C	I found him a job I found him a job which takes him out of the house for three days a week well that's a bonus
A	three day every week
C	yeah every week forever
B	I offered
A	so how many weeks are you going to do it for?
B	well I'll do the first few days and see how we go
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah so we'll we'll start off next week that's the plan
A	so what day do you go?
B	I don't know what he's going to arrange whether
A	are you getting the
B	or we might drive I think he says
A	oh is he back here now is he?
C	who knows where he is?
B	I don't know where he is erm
C	you driving up is fine but once you are up there you are going to need a car cos you can't take yours on site it will get completely wrecked also it won't cope because you need erm
D	is that the VW?
C	you need
B	no this is just the first shipment this is apparently there's others there's another one coming after that so no
D	why Scotland
B	yeah
D	oh okay
B	they're delivering up there
C	but the next one they get in erm
B	really
C	you will be heating up pipe and wrapping it
B	yeah
D	so is it quite physical
C	no
D	no
B	well he he was telling me
B	I no I've I've never done it but apparently they they make note of the
C	I have been in charge of people doing it for many years
B	of the pipe numbers
D	yeah
B	because that's what the the other people the the the er
D	oh okay
B	and there's a picture of what you've had blah blah blah then it saves work in disputes
C	they get a wagon turns up and the wagon because these pipes are
B	they are big pipes
C	so they'll get they'll get four of these pipes on a wagon and you'd probably get between four and six wagons a day turning up because they take two hours to offload these four pipes
D	mm
C	and every pipe number
D	oh
C	yeah but there may be a
C	there may be a production problem
B	where is he now?
C	and if they find there was a production
D	in the Caribbean
C	it is like anything if they find there was a there was a production problem with a batch then they'll want to
D	a batch problem yeah
C	and we've had it we've had it in the twenty years we have been dealing with these pipes
D	it happens doesn't it?
C	yeah so that's what it's for but then the other problem is the pipe numbers are normally handwritten on so when they start in Turkey it's a six digit number usually maybe eight digits written on this pipe and then they go and get coated and that it's gone over so somebody has
B	seven
C	got a line through it and the nines they do like that which look like fours to us so nines and fours ones and sevens
B	oh right yeah
C	so it's you know it's always gonna be fraught with
B	but for some reason apparently there's a there's a bit of erm washing of the pipes or inside of them whether something gets inside or something but they apparently they
C	well
C	oh we've had yeah we've had immigrants try and get in these pipes to be shipped over
C	so they have these caps on so it's sealed but by the time they get there you can say probably twenty twenty-five twenty-five percent maybe
C	have come off
B	clean it sterilise it
C	going through it so they have to give it so it doesn't really so I can't quite understand I think this this need on this job for saying you've got to clean every pipe is pointless because I think it's just erm a stalling tactic for payments
D	so definitely
B	it's not long
C	no done in sixteen years knowing
A	so you're going next week for how many days or don't you know?
B	I don't know exactly now but probably it's Wednesday Thursday Friday
A	how are you going to get your car there?
B	at the moment I don't know when I am going it could be Tuesday night could be Wednesday morning but that's the plan but that could all change
C	exciting in Glasgow
B	yeah be alright
C	good
B	that's alright
B	yeah you are right
B	we don't know where to go
C	well yeah just book a flight to Glasgow
B	on the first flight
C	no not really
B	which one?
D	does he do a lot of travelling for work
C	erm I it depends when the jobs come in but our erm work used to go in they called it amp phases Asset to Management Periods and it went every four years so the water industry had a four year period and so in year one
D	no
C	because I mean they used to say to him well you know well who who are you? what are you doing here? he'd go well I'm the MD of oh of
D	they can't believe it no
C	no it isn't needed he should have people doing that
A	are you calling dad an idiot?
C	no but but but your dad's never but your dad's never
B	but he is
C	well he is but your dad's your dad's never done the job so you don't require any training for the job anybody can go out there and do it
D	is it really extortionate as well?
C	yeah and it's extortionate so if you've if you've
D	not bothered yeah
A	and you have to pay them
C	yeah and that happens for the crane might break down the offload you know it's not to do with the wagon it's the crane's broken down something's happened to the site they've all had to disappear health and safety reasons there'll be something going on all the time it happens erm but then the transport company try it on and they'd like put hours and hours on demurrage well if you've had your own person on site you can say actually we had half an hour there we had two hours there right so we are not accepting ten hours
D	yeah
C	we are accepting two and a half hours and I say that's another thing you've you've got to clock
B	just keep in mind
C	yeah and and and make a note yourself because if you've got somebody on site you are clocking that yourself and you've also got the guy in the wagon and you let him know you are clocking it and then they don't
D	they won't take the mick
C	yeah and it's things like that that just add up because these are I mean this is a four million pound job
D	get a few extra quid here and there
C	of course they do
B	they're just all companies aren't they trying to make?
C	of course they do
D	at
C	demurrage
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	that's what I'm saying and it soon adds up
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	doesn't it if your lorry has broken down for five hours
C	yeah that's right
D	that's two hundred and fifty quid for
C	yeah that's it
A	is there a
D	of course they are
C	and you've got so many different people on site on a job like that that nobody is willing to say welI I know
C	yeah nobody is willing they just pass the buck and say oh you've just got to erm
D	rather than just taking their word and then
C	sign for every single pipe that comes off that wagon
D	mm
C	that's what they've got to do
D	it's a shame it's got like that isn't it?
C	but it does because they they they are paying probably eighty percent maybe eighty-five percent
A	did you call grandma?
B	I've already
A	I need some
C	that fifteen percent
D	yeah
C	yeah and we and we've we've come across it time and time again and the only way to get round it is to have somebody on site twenty-four seven
D	yeah
C	so we've just learnt that over the years because we thought well great they'll pay the fifteen percent and then they come up with the demurrage and they come up with this and they come up that they haven't got the pipes I think well you've had that pipe number three times well we guess because you can't read the numbers properly
D	experience though I guess
B	last chance for anybody to come?
A	no thanks dad
C	say hi
D	say hi
B	see you later I'll get some chicken and yoghurts on the way back
A	thank you
B	anybody want anything else?
C	what time are you back?
B	well
C	a bit of chocolate
B	a bit of chocolate okay I can do that
A	how's the diet?
C	not going well clearly
C	how's yours
B	see you later
C	how's the healthy eating going with the recipes?
A	bye dad see you in a bit
D	it's good yes it's going okay actually
C	good
D	I'm not I'm not really strict but I'm I'm definitely eating okay I just want to gain a bit of muscle so I'm actually eating quite a lot more
C	mm
D	but eating more healthy rather than
C	protein and that
D	erm I don't know if you've heard of him but there's er someone called the body coach at the moment which is quite popular and his er
C	oh what's base? so
D	just healthy eating
B	some dented metal in my my way
B	there's a pile of
C	that's not a very nice way to refer to
D	no that's not very nice
C	I'm just learning about the body coach you you need to tell me about about this guy
D	yeah he's good he's on the erm yeah he's made it on social media and now it's really popular but
C	have you have you had his recipes?
B	no
C	well
A	he's not told me about it he's just been making his own dinners
C	somebody shut oh
B	it's on the latch now
A	it's on the latch bye
C	mm
A	I doubt it if it's Mother's Day actually
C	well can we make a decision because we need to know I don't know whether to make a chocolate bread and butter pudding
A	no
C	well that only serves six
A	or?
C	or a banoffee pie which serves probably ten
A	mm
C	well maybe six when you cut the portions I didn't know what to make and then I thought well it depends if if how many of us there's going to be here he is
A	I doubt
C	it's probably not on the body coach's recommended foods anyway
A	banoffee pie
C	we're just talking about Sunday
A	you are with your mum won't you?
C	on Sunday are you going to mum's?
D	Sunday
A	it's Mother's Day
C	it's Mother's Day
D	oh I guess so
A	yeah you will be with your mum
D	yes I will be yes
C	so you don't want lunch around here cos we will be doing lunch?
D	okay no thank you
C	right because I'm just wondering whether to make
A	to be fair
C	oh
A	well it's true though isn't it?
C	yes I know but you are not coming so it doesn't matter
D	no I won't sorry
C	have you got the recipe for banoffee pie? make your mother a banoffee pie does she like it?
A	yeah that would be nice
C	it is so easy
D	yeah I could do actually
A	that would be really good what are you going to?
C	do you want to take one?
D	I will cook for her actually er but she is vegetarian isn't she?
A	well I was going to say
C	I know well banoffee pie
D	she started eating meat actually now and then
C	oh what do you mean now and then?
D	well she went to she's been going she's been vegetarian for about a year and a half then she went to New York with
C	yeah
A	she ate meat in New York
C	did she?
D	yeah
A	is that do you reckon why she was grumpy?
C	oh
D	yeah she she's I think I think don't
A	because she hasn't eaten meat for ages so if she ate it then that's probably like changed the
D	it's been a good year and a half
A	that's probably why she was
C	oh right
D	and I don't think
A	I reckon it was the change in diet
D	alright
A	I'm gonna tell her
C	oh
D	oh
C	oh controversial
D	I don't think her body reacted too well to it I think it messed her around a bit because imagine not eating meat for a year and a half
C	no no that well yeah yeah that's right
A	what did she eat in New York?
D	erm
C	chicken wings sausages burgers
D	yeah yeah bacon and steak and stuff
A	so went all out
C	why?
D	I don't think I I
A	she had turkey with you didn't she?
C	oh I didn't realise
D	mm only only for about six months
C	yeah
A	I want a sausage
C	yeah there was one barbecue and just decided that was that back on meat just like that I thought okay
D	it is weird isn't it?
C	yeah
D	I mean
C	for reasons they didn't like it or reasons for?
D	I think it's just I think it's just they think it's over produced I think obviously it's natural to eat meat of course it is but I think the way we mass produce it and mass slaughter I think we over produce
A	yeah
C	well well we we probably do because I like a vegetarian meal of a week and your dad was always like oh
A	the thing is dad likes them
C	that that he'll eat it now but normally you don't tell him there's no
A	yeah
C	and that's a really nice and filling and I used to do quite a lot of pasta dishes without meat
A	but he's the same though he'll never have it
C	you yeah but you said straightaway I'm not giving well don't do cannelloni if
A	yeah you you wouldn't want it if there's no meat in there
C	he would he'd eat it
D	I would yeah
C	and he might not even notice as they are as filling as they are
D	yeah since my mum's been back now
A	oh yeah you took her for an Indian didn't you? and I didn't even ask what she had
C	yeah okay good for her
D	oh yeah she's been I think she's been for an Indian and stuff and she's had vegetarian
D	options or like a
C	right yeah
D	biryani or some sort of fish but
C	well there you are then
D	now and then she's been having a little bit of meat I mean she she still doesn't eat meat probably five nights out of seven a week
C	no for the most of it
D	mm
D	mm
C	yeah definitely
A	so would I
C	would you?
A	yeah I don't like chicken do I very much? I like beef
D	you had chicken pizza
A	yeah that was quite nice but I wouldn't use like I wouldn't wouldn't miss it
A	mm
C	with the
A	yeah
C	the one the coconut milk and the er Slimming World one you have
A	yeah I'm just saying I wouldn't miss it if I didn't have meat
C	mm
A	it means I would have to have pasta and I quite like all that stuff
D	I mean it's easy just to have a salmon every day isn't it?
C	mm mm
D	and then maybe that would be
C	yeah
D	mm
C	so what are you going to cook her on Sunday?
D	I don't know I'll have to ask her actually in fact we are going to a
C	what meat or no meat?
D	yeah exactly
C	or out for a meal?
D	well we're going out for a meal for her birthday and she we are going for a a roast dinner
C	mm
D	so she'll be having so she'll be having
C	where are you going?
C	oh lovely yeah
D	where we went for er
C	how many of you are going for that?
D	erm there will be
C	when's her birthday?
D	it's not until the nineteenth of April but
C	okay
D	because of
C	mm
D	letting us know in advance as to what she wants to do
D	I'm not sure
C	because Easter is early it might be towards the end of it might it be the nineteenth
D	I'm not sure
C	okay well that'll be good
D	oh the body coach so his his
C	the body coach
D	his motto the kind of
C	mm
D	it's lean in fifteen he calls it so it's fifteen minute meals that are quite lean
C	oh not to only fifteen which has been and gone
C	lean in
D	yeah he just
C	mainly protein
D	er not even to mainly protein just just low
C	low fat
D	decent meals that you can just whack them you know
C	oh right
D	cook them up in fifteen minutes which is quite good
C	oh
D	yes yes well he's he's on
C	no
D	he's probably on Facebook but he's
C	oh okay
D	yeah I'm
C	there's always somebody coming up isn't there? with new ideas
D	it's been really good but er I haven't got his cook book but I might I might get it erm but he's posted a lot of his recipes online
C	right
D	and I've done quite a few of them
C	but are you just cooking for you most nights?
D	mm yeah
C	yeah
D	no
C	cos she's not there or cos it's meat or combination?
D	both
C	mm
D	both yeah we just get in at different times
A	she doesn't eat with you does she?
D	well normally yeah
A	she gets in at normal time now
D	yeah she walks the dog and then sometimes she's out sometimes I'm out
A	she's just
D	she always has something quick
C	no
D	no she never has a
A	she's one of these that she never has this
C	does she not?
D	she never eats a proper meal no
A	no never
C	what
A	has a sandwich or something
C	oh really? does she have a main meal at lunch time? or or she just picks kind of just generally
A	she kind of walks
C	mind you it's like if if you've just used to doing just for you and then
A	she does it for herself
D	I mean she'll she'll buy some fish cakes
D	put them in the oven while she's walking the dog
C	yeah
D	and have it with some salad
C	when she gets back yeah
D	or she'll buy like a salmon croquets or something
A	but like I say she never really sits down and has
D	no she she never cooks a meal for herself really
A	no
C	yeah
D	which take ten minutes but a lot of the time she'll just have
A	sandwich
D	yeah so many times
C	because it's it's quick quick meal just for her
D	she sometimes doesn't get back from work till seven eight o'clock does she?
C	mm
D	then she walks the dog
C	she never puts a meal in the oven sets the timer puts the slow cooker on then does
D	no she used to when we were kids and stuff but
C	oh I suppose when yeah
D	then when she
C	it's just her now isn't it? that she's cooking for
C	mm
A	you are kind of at work and then do your own thing and I don't know it's just just different isn't it? a different way of
D	and then obviously when she was erm
C	mm
D	at that age she was that happy with obviously
C	yeah
D	yeah she just she never cooks now does she really?
C	oh okay
D	it's really weird she just
C	she doesn't enjoy it doesn't want to do it
D	no
C	oh she has
D	mm
C	does she go for the school dinners?
D	I think so
C	yeah
D	yep
C	have your main meal then have a
D	well she's taken she took on her own catering team so it's not through
C	right
D	they they haven't done it through erm the council
C	mm
D	and I think they've got really good competitive healthy meals now
C	oh right
D	they actually make a profit on their school dinners which not many schools do
C	no
D	mm
C	that's so she's responsible for that because she does she does all the finance doesn't she there the budgets?
D	yes she's like she's just the business manager of the school
C	yeah
D	taken on their own
C	oh right
D	I think a lot of the companies that do sort of their paper and stuff and office supplies probably because they get through like thirty
C	really?
C	oh mind you they are always sending letters home aren't they? whether they get home or not
D	yeah and all the worksheets and all the
C	mm
A	homework yeah
D	imagine having a class of thirty and then just printing them off two pages each straightaway you've done
C	mm
A	mm
A	nothing
D	what do you fancy?
A	one of those nice
D	I don't know if they do them at Waitrose
A	at Co-op
D	I don't like the Co-op

C	right right right
D	yes yeah
C	what to get paid?
D	I haven't spoken to her once really erm
C	oh is she doing what she should be doing?
D	I don't know I think so
C	oh she did? okay
D	yeah
C	and you had to pay presumably now on your Vat?
D	it's a direct debit so it will just come out yeah
C	so you yeah you you are not getting a refund any more? you're
D	no
C	no
D	and then it's erm
D	again so it's our Vat return again now so I haven't spoken to her for three months
C	what month are we on? the third is that your VAT return?
D	so
C	May June
D	mm the last one ended
C	yeah
D	November
C	so you you give her the figures she files it and you
D	yeah

D	that's it yeah I don't I don't know what else
C	is she she's on she's running payroll for you
D	yeah but we haven't it's set up but we haven't done a payroll yet
C	no
D	no we haven't set that up well we did say we are probably going to do that next month
C	fine but so she is on that because
D	I'm always very conscious that if if I do contact the team she is going to rack up a large bill I don't know how it works so I'm always a bit
C	yeah I I wouldn't I wouldn't have thought so for for a few questions I I think that's going to be kind of in your annual charge
D	yeah
C	because the annual did she quote you something for doing the accounts? your year end is when July? June?
D	I'm not sure oh I really don't know
C	when did you register when did you when did you incorporate the company can you remember the date?
D	I can't remember
C	I think well I think it's going to be around June time
D	yeah
C	is it? going to see well there's only the two of you going through it
D	well there was yeah but
C	I think you'd be looking around seven hundred and fifty or something for your annual accounts with all that included for the for the year but
D	because I remember my friend did er like work experience in an accountants and they just used to
C	he was he the KPMG guy? or the price?
D	no no he he was just through a a private company
C	oh
D	but it's a big company that he trained there and they did they do a lot of but it they
C	well I think when it when it when it comes to the year end you should you know say to
D	yeah I don't think obviously I mean she won't she won't take the mick in the sense of
C	no I don't think
D	I'm guessing she's got all our data in that account so I guess she'll
C	yes yeah yeah
D	prompt her I suppose to meet up and to chase that up I would have thought
C	mm
A	that's mum's friend her face has come up at twenty-two three years age of age

C	apparently that one in
D	it's a bit far for me
C	oh I suppose mm
D	but I think the U F G is more towards weights so there's a lot more bars and free weights where
