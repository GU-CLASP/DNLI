B	we have the exact same relationship with like very very similar personalities which is weird cos we don't have the same dad but whatever
A	mm
B	so I dunno she would like see her what like every maybe like three times a year two times a year sometimes one times a year one time sorry
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah it irritates me
B	it's something that gets under my skin and then from then on she always calls it supper and I
A	to embarrassing her
B	or to embarrass her
A	you doing it
B	so when we are alone I would be just like why are you all of a sudden calling it supper? she's like I've always called it supper supper its supper it's supper time like you've never fucking called it supper in your life I was like I've known you for about sixteen seventeen years why are you calling it supper now
A	get it out get it out
B	okay its
A	just get it out
B	I haven't even
A	it's fine
B	been able to say it to dad because a few times I've brought it up there's never been a moment where my mum hasn't been there and me and my dad will have a quick chuckle but then you know what my mum's like she's like oh am I not in on the joke can I not know is it just something between you and your dad? and I'm just like
A	cos she's fucking
B	ah my god she's just like
A	put herself out of this situation
B	out so that she could bitch and moan and whine about
A	and that's your mum all over all over
B	and that's my mum
A	mm
B	when we go for
A	yeah
B	but that's just how
A	yeah that's just who she is yeah
B	my mum
A	cos she got defensive cos she knew exactly what she were doing
B	exactly
A	and you were picking up on it
B	and it turned into a massive argument and then my dad being the peacekeeper that he is would always come to me and be like you're not handling the situation appropriately
A	yeah
B	and I was like oh my god I'm so glad you noticed cos she was like it's never happened before apart from the last time she was in France so that was literally like two three years ago
A	erm
B	at the time and I was just like
A	the more she picks them as
B	leeches and that's like fair enough it's like I've
A	yeah
B	you swear a lot but like I'm not stealing your personality it's just because
A	yeah
B	I feel like like I can just let loose
A	yeah
B	because you swear a lot it's just like it's acceptable for me to do that
A	yeah
B	but that's like a part of my personality coming out so
A	but that's not you copying what I do yeah
B	I'm not copying you I'm not like I don't know I can't even think of any mannerisms that you have that
A	yeah
B	If you know what I mean
A	so irritating
B	and it literally it gets right under my skin because I'm like mum if you have to change the way that you act to be more like these people they're not your fucking friends
A	yeah I swear a lot
B	my mum literally has Tourette's but by choice and I'm just like
A	she's very erm
B	she's a sheep
A	do you know what your mum is do you know what she the best way that I can describe her she's an actor on a stage
B	oh
A	she is the character on stage
B	kind of describes it
A	that's who she is
B	it irritates the fuck out of me
A	so many times I've noticed like
B	the way she tries to go all American and she's like awesome
A	that is annoying
B	oh
A	she does something with her lips
B	that's
A	she went like that with her lips like
B	that's what I've been trying to explain with
A	and it fucking winds me up
B	except like without sounding
A	cos that's like how she is though
B	and that's what
A	yeah
B	it's like you never actually talk like that
A	she did it when
B	erm
A	like I know I don't know your mum as well you do but I know your mum as it's down to her person
B	it's that that irritates me the most though it's because she acts like someone that I know her not to be
A	yeah
B	and it's like there's a lot of things of her personality that don't get me wrong I absolutely fucking despise
A	yeah
B	but I let go because I know it's it's purely her
A	yeah
B	and it's just things that irritate me because I'm not like that
A	yeah she's just does it all the time attention seeking
B	I'm sorry but her her idea of gossip like the only gossip that I would actually gossip with my parents is
A	mm
B	she is aware so I
A	yeah
B	and
A	because
B	yeah and the only
A	yeah
B	over uni
B	and the stupid fucking English bitches in book club because you're too lazy to go out and make French friends
A	yeah
B	no offence but it's the truth
A	she's lived there for 10 years and she
B	when I was actually telling her about
A	no but yeah it is foreign though cos you haven't lived here for ten years
B	that I've never known basically
B	in your life that I don't care about
A	she's such a cunt
A	she make me laugh cos like
B	I swear to god I lose the will to live
A	literally literally
B	these three months of summer have been fucking painful
A	I bet they have
B	it's like
A	because she can't call you when she wants
B	it's like I
A	yeah
B	but it will be
B	no one gives a shit they are fucking your tenants
B	I'm just like
A	fuck off
B	I'm just like I actually genuinely do not care what those kids are up to
A	do you even know them? no
B	it's just like sorry I don't even live there
A	or like them it's so irritating
B	any more I will come back at Christmas and I will talk to the parents by all means but those kids I just don't give a fuck
A	yeah
B	I'm sorry like
A	to help you
B	to tell me how to do it I was like you're a fucking child like at that age you don't give a shit
A	no
B	you will get thrown in at the deep end and you'll make your own friends
A	it's not like you're an adult
B	if you have someone there every night
A	no
B	and the fact that she told me that when I was just like oh yes so you think that I am coming back for three months of summer after a year of
A	yeah
B	I have my friends I have my boyfriend like I want to do other things
A	yeah
B	and then when I try and explain that to her and she was like yeah I said that you wouldn't mind I hope that you don't
A	yeah like that's
B	and don't be stupid
A	literally that's what like everyone what everyone can give every advice
B	I'm just like like
A	everyone can give
B	you could have asked my fucking dog and he would have said the same thing
B	do you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	I'm just like well
A	what more can I add?
B	she just
A	yeah
B	she's not a a bitch cos she's my mum and I love her
A	yeah I know what you mean though
B	but if she was not my mum ah oh god some of the things that she comes out with I'm just like
B	I wish I was not sharing a house with you right now
B	well
A	how you cope
B	well the good thing was three weeks towards the end I didn't have to see her
A	yeah
B	sounds awful I spent two days with her and
A	mm
B	and on the Saturday afternoon
A	yeah
B	and I'd always wanted to go and we hadn't been all summer
A	well she
B	well it just does my fucking head in and then
A	oh it's so awkward at Christmas when she kept saying that to me
B	and then she actually
A	so awkward
B	right like whatever I don't care okay but she got back on the Sunday and I left Tuesday morning she got back Sunday afternoon we had Monday together
A	mm
B	erm at home
A	that would like not like to do
B	yeah I was like I can't think of anything worse to do with my last day
B	in France bearing in mind it's my last day of the whole summer
A	yeah one day isn't gonna hurt
B	and then she complained to me when I was like and it got to eleven o'clock at night and I had to be up at fucking what like six o'clock in the morning to get my flight
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	she didn't need to go for three weeks though
A	she didn't need to go for three weeks
B	that's the thing what pissed me off the most because I'm not jealous that my mum spends time with my other sisters
A	no of course you're not
B	good luck to my other sisters to be completely honest but to come back and make me feel guilty as if I was the one that was doing all of that I was just like
A	she didn't she did not need to be in England for the amount of time she was
B	no
A	and she did not need to go when she did
B	she's fucking going back in November
A	like exactly and it's not exactly as if your mum and dad are made of money and your mum just thinks it's okay to like swan off and spend all this money
B	my mum doesn't understand it that that year that she pissed off for three months to New Zealand how much do you think that fucking cost?
A	why did she fuck off for so long?
B	ah fuck knows mid
A	to be honest I don't know how you cope with your mum
B	well
A	mm
B	as you've obviously noticed what with all
A	yeah you are
B	everything
A	it's really frustrating
B	erm
A	like you know when you went to rant to your dad and he's just not having any of it
B	yeah
A	its like that's what I feel like when I rant to you
B	really?
A	yeah like I feel like sometimes when I rant to you just like well think of it like this and look at it like this and sometimes just want to hear like fucking bitch and fucking this and I want you to rant with me and you never do and I'm just like
B	I know that
A	mm
B	to calm you down
A	no but like
B	I know
A	and then I get it from you as well and it's like right okay
B	I'm sorry but there are there are some things that like
A	I can't rant to anyone any more
B	it can be something really stupid like
A	I have no friends to rant to
B	imagine like just extreme examples someone killing someone else and you come and rant to me about that I can be calm about that
A	mm
B	my uh uh
A	just flip over some salt being taken out of the shaker
B	literally
B	literally oh my god I feel the worst argument I've ever had with my dad is because
A	I can't imagine you and your dad arguing
B	well it was a one way argument and basically it was me
B	insulting him but I'd had a very very bad day at college
A	what did you say to him
B	erm a lot of swear words and a lot of ranting that had nothing to do with the actual problem I just had a very very bad few months at boarding and come home and I wanted a cheese and ham toastie
B	yes
B	obviously food
B	erm and my dad knew clockwork I would be home at twelve-thirty
A	yeah
B	and he knew I would always have a toastie
B	fucking got home and I had been looking forward to it all week that I mean this was literally like the thing that kept me going without slitting my wrists with a blunt spoon from the canteen
B	and literally opened the fridge to get all the ingredients together and I saw there was no no cheese and I opened up the bin just to check as you do and I just saw the empty packet like just on the top conveniently placed
B	I
A	the straw that broke the camel's back
B	and unfortunately he was the one that had to take everything and he he just stood there and took it
B	and after I was finished he was like would you like me to go to the shop and buy some more cheese? and I was just like
B	like too embarrassed to show my face for the rest of the day I just took my toastie upstairs and was like oh my god
B	he did not deserve any of that he just made himself a sandwich with a little bit of cheese in it
B	right I need to pee so badly
A	okay
B	will you still be here when I get back and
A	and then I'm going to bed
B	okay
A	when you've peed
