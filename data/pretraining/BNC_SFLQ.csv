A	no I'm not in a hurry it's just he said to me cos you know when we go to
B	yeah
A	and he said do you wanna go and see a show? and then it just reminded me Lion King is amazing even though I think he meant something a bit cheaper I thought if I looked then I could suggest it to him that we do it like in the new year sometime
