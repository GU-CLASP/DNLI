B	that's okay
A	or smoked haddock mussel and prawn bouillabaisse

A	why didn't you meet them in town?
B	cos they've been quite busy they met
A	who's
A	why
B	and
A	why don't they stay with us?
B	but I have offered
A	it would have been easy in the old days er getting the North London line all the way wouldn't they darling? cos it was
B	how would they get to
A	oh
B	from here?
A	absolutely no idea isn't it on the District line?
B	no it's not on a tube stop
A	are you surely there
B	yeah no there's no
A	are you sure?
B	it's got to overground hasn't it? hold on that was the end of
A	that's what I just said
B	yeah it wasn't a tube though it was the overground
A	that's not a tube but I thought it was on the tube
B	so they'd have to get to the overland basically which means where's the nearest place to catch the overland from here?
A	no fucking idea
B	would that be Camden? Camden road or something?
A	no there'd be a better way than that
B	yeah there would that's the only way I know
A	yeah that's a lot of travelling
B	yeah
A	did you give them instructions how to find this place?
B	well I've said go you can't go wrong so long as you get on the right train
A	oh
B	no we don't know do we?
A	just depends just depends which escalator you get
B	well yeah it's random really
A	yeah I never know where I'm coming out and I've been doing it for years

A	oh good
B	so do I look alright?
A	mm yeah and there's no point finishing early if I just have to go round to
B	no there isn't it's true
A	and I finish too late anyway for
B	ah
A	what?
B	creamy garlic portobello mushroom on sourdough
A	yeah I said that
B	well I'm saying it now mains which is the veggie?
A	is that what you'd have is it?
B	there's hardly any vegetarian options
A	there's only that pearl barley
B	yeah that's a bit weedy really I think we should probably go for pizza you said that too didn't you?
A	do they want to eat?
B	yes
A	or they've probably never been to a Wimpy
B	yeah all-day breakfast's probably still going
A	or would they like the Italian Eritrean
B	it probably would that's very vegetarian isn't it?
A	yeah
B	is that the one with the dips?
A	or pizza
B	more comfortable in the
A	they have Eritrean beer?
B	do they? is it nice beer?
A	I tried every single one
A	I think they have three
B	I mean that's more Londony if we do that
A	you've got to remember we've got to sell
B	yeah we do
A	to they will go back and they word all over all of Europe will be
B	yeah exactly it's all down to us resting on us really
A	there do you want to play a board game darling whilst we wait?

B	oh it would be nice to go to the
A	what darling?
B	it would be nice to go to the
A	oh they're playing Scrabble
B	there's a Scrabble
A	oh let's shall I teach you how to play mancala?
B	yeah okay oh that's probably ours did we give that away?
A	no well
B	is this a game that uses your brain?
A	yeah but I've never quite worked out how
B	is it it's er it's a bit boring otherwise if it doesn't
A	okay so let me try and just think how you play it you pick up any one you like
B	and what's the object of the game?
A	to have most things in here
B	to have all these things in one of these holes?
A	yeah we'll just play it and then you'll pick it up
B	in there
A	just help me put four in each again
B	do I have to start in any particular place?
A	going
B	can you work that out or is that
A	well yeah cos it's
B	is it more random than that?
A	it's easy now cos you know there's four and that's one two three four and you'd get another go later on when there's loads it's difficult to work out
B	I'll do that then
A	so one
B	it's pretty boring
A	well how do you know? you've only gone once
A	your go
B	er where do I pick up from now?
A	anywhere on your side of the board
B	anywhere I want?
A	yeah
B	it isn't going in order then?
A	no you can do what you want
B	just to get as many stuck in here as you can
A	and how do you how do you get them in there again?
B	every time you go past it you drop one off in there
A	also I should point out when you're finished you get every all the ones that a other person has left that's important to remember all so I can do the same as you look
B	can I pick up one of these?
A	yeah
B	do what you want
A	any of these?
B	oh then I wouldn't go very far there either what was that opposite thing again?
A	put it into one if I were to end up with one there I'd capture your one opposite
B	can't I oh
A	it won't become clear until you know how it works so we'll just rush through this first
B	so far it's very boring
B	er? I've got those
A	no but if you'd gone one you would have won all this
B	I have
A	no no the last one the last that you put down
B	oh
A	fills an empty one and you you capture
B	the last one you put there?
A	you capture everything on this side
B	oh
A	too late
B	this is stupid
A	stupid
B	I'm bored
A	oh yeah
B	so you like playing this game?
B	and
A	losing to
B	oh I don't know was that in there?
A	no it wasn't
B	why?
A	otherwise your next go you'll go one two and capture the rest
B	is it Greek?
A	er I think it's more
B	how did you find out about this game?
A	you see it being played on one's travels
B	yeah it's that sort of thing
A	no that's that's your go I don't think we're going to have another game
B	alright there's four of them
A	no that's alright
B	I think there are three
A	no but then you go again
B	oh why cos the last one went on there?
A	yeah and then you can go again by doing another move
B	er don't I get that?
A	no
B	why?
A	cos your last one went over here
B	oh
A	just your ones
B	yeah but can you only go to there and you go you can just skip one?
A	no you can't skip one
B	no of course you can't
A	it's my last one and I'm opposite yours
B	you get you get the opposite and you get the ones that were in your
A	yeah
B	hole
A	use them all up
A	another go
B	I wanna do that thing where you nab the opposite it's not happened yet
A	you've done it
B	I've got another go
A	have another go go there and then you get another move
B	what from there to there?
A	no there and then it's the last one
B	one two three and I can get that one
A	correct
B	one two
A	I've got nothing left so I capture
B	oh
A	all of yours and visually we can tell that I've won
B	yeah
A	alright? play once more?
B	no boring
A	it was boring
A	we're still learning the rules
B	yeah okay
