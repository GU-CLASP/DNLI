B	oh right
A	I've
B	oh
A	about three hours a day
B	really?
A	yeah
B	that's real dedication
A	mm
B	one of the things that's always appealed to me about the model engineers is the
A	oh no I'm not
B	they're
A	no
A	not really into railways railways have always left me cold erm from the age of nine
B	oh right?
A	to twenty-one
B	oh right?
A	and I wasn't a bit interested in the trains
A	back in the er the days of steam you'd be
B	yes
A	er specially in the summer if you had the door open
B	yes
A	and you hear a train coming and look out you could see the glow from the firebox as it went past
B	yes
A	but erm
A	you couldn't hear a thing as they trundled past
B	yeah
A	well of course they're a lot smaller
B	yeah
A	it has it's had its ups and downs
B	yeah
A	it's not perfect but then whatever is?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	er no
A	they they stole a digger and demolished the pavilion yeah
B	yes that's right
A	yeah
B	well I I remember reading it in the gazette and I said when you said you
B	erm

A	no when I was a teenager
B	mm
A	there were a
B	right
A	and er
B	no no
A	least I didn't think so at the time
B	these
A	I probably would now
B	these were you know
A	oh right yeah yeah
B	they were
A	right
B	in Victorian England which I had found a collection of in a junk shop
A	right?
B	and I talked about it and I've got still got them and they're wonderful
A	yeah
B	of it really
A	yes

B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er
A	we've got a return loop unfortunately we haven't
B	right
A	so I've just seen somebody else turn up possibly with an engine
B	oh right
A	they did say they wanted to get the bugs out of this engine
B	oh did they?
A	yeah
B	so let's have let's see how far we've we how well we've got on at the moment

B	oh
A	mm
B	oh well that's erm
A	well not out of the area no and we've moved
B	no
A	houses in the locality
B	yes
A	yes
B	so your biggest influence as far as speech is concerned will would've been
B	yeah
A	I remember when we first moved to
B	right
A	which by then I mean it's part of the town virtually now
B	yes
A	but when we went there I was nine that would've been nineteen fifty
