C	no she does two now I've got her into two
A	alright
C	she said
B	what eggs?
C	well okay so mum brought me up and whenever she'd do an egg she'd say oh do you want an egg but I'd get two eggs
B	yeah
C	so I always associated when you do an egg or ask someone for an egg you get two
A	cos one egg doesn't doesn't cut it
C	no you don't do eggs in one and then so I went to
B	I found one egg is enough
C	I haven't heard that one before
A	no no that's original
C	went to went to
A	just about gives you the taste for it
C	yeah
A	I think and then
C	and so gradually over the years she now had learned to do me two eggs but apparently she even does two eggs for herself now she doesn't do them ones any more
A	and she found that one's not enough?
C	yeah
A	mm

B	yeah
A	hotel? I thought it was just about erm bed and breakfasts
C	no it's only kind of
A	oh
C	thing
A	so is theirs a five-star hotel?
C	yes on five acres of land on a farm or something like that
A	oh how lovely
C	it's very it looks very lovely yes
A	but I I would you know I would really hate to buy a beautiful nice big house and turn it into a bed and breakfast I'd hate to run bed and breakfast or hotels or
C	I like the idea of it but I think the reality would be
A	oh twenty-four hours a day seven days a week there's just no rest from it
C	well actually what I would do is I would I would buy a house to have as a hotel and I wouldn't live there and I'd I'd pay someone else to run it for me
A	yeah because you know when you've got it it's an invasion on your home you can never get away from it
C	no I wouldn't live there I'd just own it
A	yeah
C	and then I'd pay a manager and I'd just drift in and out whenever I fancied it
A	it is leaking is it darl?
B	yeah just slightly now it's not pouring so I will call
A	so we will yeah we should get
B	but it's not a big deal
A	no
C	here you go
A	I don't know it might be worth getting a proper
B	yeah yeah yeah I'll see
A	much noisier with it pulled out by the way
C	I know it's very offensive I don't like loud noises in my ears
A	it's got a door in front of it hasn't it? mm
A	what was she doing?
C	he was trying to make canapés cos they had family coming round or his family coming round

A	yep
C	then why are you moaning then? erm
C	and then he said oh could you take her home please? she's really annoying me today
A	oh
C	this hasn't got bleach in it has it?
A	I love to bleach bleach
C	I know that's why most of my clothes have bleach stains cos you didn't tell us where the bleach is and then someone touches something and they've got a bleach stain on their clothes
C	that's why I don't like kitchen cleaners with bleach cos they're so easy to like just get in your clothes
B	what?
C	it's just it's just the noise that
C	well that didn't even shut you just opened it again
A	take the top out that's dry now
C	oh
A	it's quite an invasive noise I I find the fan in the treatment room at work like that I it comes on automatically with the light and I have to turn it off in the office because it just gets on my nerves
A	no
C	no
A	anyone want some cheesy snaps?
C	no
A	snacks?

A	well why don't recycle it? that'll be charity shop it or whatever
C	what? it's for that DVD player I don't see how that would be useful for anyone
A	well
C	okay
A	then it smelt of fish
A	why did it smell all fishy inside?
C	I don't know I didn't put fish in it I think it's just cos it'd been in the bin
A	the outside wasn't fishy seems like
C	well I don't know obviously someone put fish in it
B	it'll be five minutes alright?
C	thank heaven for that god it's takes took your time didn't you dad
B	you want a glass of wine or anything
A	no best not I'm going to work
B	fair enough love oh
A	that was lovely that carver that we had last night
B	was it?
A	really nice
C	weird it's two thousand and fifteen now isn't it?
A	I know
C	mm did you feel special?
A	mm
C	cos we're the
A	meanie
C	I know
A	so
C	well it was a pub and it's a fiver to get in so I thought it was gonna be like a sedate evening just a few people in the a pub
A	mm
C	but it it was like a proper erm a very modern pub with a dance floor and no there there was a DJ deck and it was just like being in a club there were loads of people on the dance floor
A	oh right
C	erm there was the bar are with all the seating and then there was the dance floor and then the bar in the middle
B	oh
C	I've got a message
A	I couldn't last night I had to get it off with a corkscrew oh did I tell you that?
B	yeah
C	oh
A	ah
C	see we're lovely aren't we?
A	who was it just you and
C	yeah
A	erm are you not supposed to have a variety of voices? you can't just have
B	no I can imagine
A	and then I had the corkscrew you know the armed corkscrew where you can
B	yeah
A	I had it and I was well I had a sort of
B	lovely isn't it?
A	so have we not had any here before? it's really nice
C	is it a carver?
A	yeah it was a really expensive one that was half price
C	nice
A	well not really expensive but by
C	more than you'd pay for it
A	yeah
C	half price and then if you bought three you got how much off?
B	twenty percent
A	twenty percent off
B	and that stopped that
A	but then still half price
B	yeah still yeah
A	it's light and
B	it's got flavour to it
A	mm
B	so it's not sweet and fizzy and that's what I don't like about them a lot of these are
C	oh I love sweet and fizzy erm
A	like Asti Asti Spumante
C	I've never I've never
A	you always get that at work whenever there's like there's about four bottles of it in the larder ready for today why do they always get Asti Spumante? it's disgusting
B	it's sort of a bit seventies
A	yeah
B	it's something that people used to go when they used to go on holidays to Spain you know?
A	hand in hand with Babycham
B	yeah it's a Spanish thing isn't it?
A	mm
B	people used to go to Majorca for a holiday it's
A	mm
C	are you gonna drink your tea or
A	I am
C	I am
A	it's a bit hot at the moment to be honest
C	I am
A	I am
C	I am
A	so was
B	er he's well I dunno ring him up
A	no can't be no it's no point I can only ring him on Viber when he's at mum's cos he's got no internet at the house
C	at
A	mm
C	they don't have internet? is that a conscious thing or have they just not go round to
A	well I think for the amount of times they're down there time they're down there it's not worth it
C	it's not worth it mm
A	yeah
B	I'd say that's done now but how much do you want of it?
C	I'll have half for now and then maybe go back
A	and also if they're going down there for a fortnights holiday it's actually quite nice to be cut off the internet
C	yeah
A	and not
C	I said to
A	mm
C	and I said yeah that's normal isn't it? and erm and
A	mm it is really annoying I don't understand them
C	no cos I thought maybe that's just what people do maybe it's just me being fussy but yeah it's not just me
A	I know mind you I think partly it's
C	well yeah
A	but for something like over the Christmas period I don't think they would have even considered it
C	yeah
A	you know hire a cottage or something but I mean they've
C	I mean
A	well yeah yeah that's fine she has a great time at
C	yeah but I thought maybe that's just what people did with dogs and I'm just being naïve but obviously not
A	I just think if you're going to stay in other people's houses to say oh can I bring my dog? is you know it's cos I'm pretty sure in the position where oh yes
C	you can't say no
A	yeah but it it's a huge you know if you're a person who hasn't got dogs it's a massive adaptation especially when you've got cats and the dog keeps trying to eat them
A	and
C	does she usually not?
A	she was a bit chasey during the summer she used to chase them out the cat-flap quite a lot
B	ah
C	maybe she's just
A	but I genuinely don't think
C	she's a bit too small to hurt them anyway she couldn't really
A	yeah
B	evil mm
A	and she's not used to cats and she's aggressive towards them
A	again why is she divorced?
C	well
A	mm
C	and they they were engaged when
A	oh I remember then it all split up
C	and and then well they didn't split up but
A	mm
A	so is
C	well she says she says
A	oh
C	until it just kind of popped up in conversation and apparently her
A	perhaps it's just going to be a really small affair
C	maybe but I mean her mum didn't even know and apparently her mum only found out
A	ah
C	and then
A	flower girl don't ever say flower girl please?
B	why?
A	it's American we don't have flower girls in this country we have bridesmaids
B	that's not the same thing
A	in America
B	yeah alright
C	yeah
A	we don't have that in this country
C	I'm just telling you a story that
A	no please don't use Americanisms in this house
C	we don't do that in this family do we?
C	we're not anti-American but we just don't we just hate anything American
A	no it's not that it's just that our language is become Americanised by the day
C	I don't see I don't see the issue
A	mm no I don't with a lot of things but erm
B	like flower girls
A	no I mean things like movies I don't like movies
C	so I copy from French if I said déjà vu you wouldn't tell me not to say it
A	well no cos that's a sort of French expression that's sort of
C	that's considered it's considered more high class to speak French than American
A	no it's but anglicised isn't it? it's just it's just a sort of anglicised expression
B	and it sounds nicer
A	is the buzzer going?
B	hm?
C	anyway erm
A	no it's cos you said flower girl
C	well yes cos that's what
C	erm yeah and so I don't really know what er
A	is
C	she's not upset but she's like she better be having me as a bridesmaid
A	ah
C	but it seems a bit strange she wouldn't tell her mum but maybe she just forgot cos she's been engaged before to the same man she forgot she was engaged again
A	is she still really shy
C	yeah
B	is she?
A	I did not
B	is she? is she really shy?
C	yeah
A	not with you though
C	no obviously not with us just with people
A	so did you have a really good time anyway at the pub?
C	yeah it was quite good we arrived about nine
A	mm
C	and then we just had a drink sat down with some drinks for about an hour while the place filled up
A	mm
C	and erm we went to the dance floor and danced for about two hours we waited for the countdown and then we left
A	what cos you left early? why did you leave early?
C	we just had enough of dancing
B	and you went to the chip shop didn't you and got sausage and chips
C	er huh
A	cor I'll tell you what if you get the chance to have a look on the internet
B	I will
A	look at the London
C	yeah I bet they were good
A	it's amazing
C	the thing is that always puts me off going to London is that hotel prices are
A	yeah
C	probably I mean I'm sure you could
A	it was erm anyway it's ten quid a head now and on principle I don't think I'd want to pay that
B	yeah but it's for safety reasons
A	yeah I know exactly
B	and did you see the Chinese one?
C	yeah
A	no oh yeah
C	oh
A	yeah
B	because of
A	overcrowding
B	overcrowding
A	yes but I mean it's never happened in London before has it? there's people go up every year for the
C	yeah but apparently it was getting bigger and bigger
B	yeah
C	apparently last year there were five hundred thousand people there
A	were there?
C	mm
B	I think their safety thing is an issue but obviously they're gonna make some money out of it
A	mm
C	yeah
C	although I don't think a tenner I mean it could be a lot more
A	I suppose a tenner isn't too bad but I just looked at the thousands and thousands of people and I thought true I know the fireworks will have cost a pretty penny
C	mm hm
A	but I can't see that they cost
C	well a hundred thousand people there times ten ten hundred thousand what's that?
A	yeah were there were there a hundred thousand? is that
C	they sold a hundred thousand tickets yeah
B	I think it's quite good
A	but could you stand in there? presumably you could stand outside the barriered area for nothing
C	I guess so
A	yeah I would have done that
B	yeah I did see them on the news this morning
A	and I wish I'd seen the Australian ones cos I can't be arsed
B	the what?
A	I wish I'd seen the Australian ones cos apparently ours were much better
C	the Australia's the first like one of the first countries to
A	mm well they had theirs sort of in the morning
C	mm
A	there there was all when I looked at my phone at work on yesterday morning
C	they're nine hours ahead I think?
A	it must be more than that because when I was at work yesterday morning that would have been
C	that's when
A	before nine
C	I don't know
A	oh I'm so
B	oh don't moan at me
A	what are you two doing this evening
B	I'm really sorry
C	I want to watch the rest of four in a bed cos I was thinking it's like a funny one
A	no I want to watch some of it now
