B	there's lots of snippets isn't there? there's
C	yeah
B	nothing long
C	no like I say it's just so very grainy footage oh there's some real old stuff at the beginning
B	must have been nice you know in a way having a good community of people around
C	well you had lots of you had lots of people yeah I think there's an even earlier shot of this where it's
B	actually a tramp?
C	yeah
B	a homeless person?
C	yeah
C	god knows
C	yeah there used to be tramps
B	is that his real beard I take it?
C	no
C	yeah so this is pretty grainy stuff
B	ah it's crazy like now that we have footage and we have recordings how much history's been lost
C	yes
B	cos we never had it
C	yeah
B	I mean can you imagine what the world will be like in the next five hundred years?
C	yes
B	yeah when five hundred years time you can look back at this
C	look back at yeah
B	and think that's five hundred years old
C	years old yeah I know and one day if we haven't destroyed ourselves that will be the case
B	yeah
C	yeah so I don't know what this this is at
B	pretty impressive slide
C	yeah it's no longer there
B	how do you feel when you watch it?
C	strange cos er a lot of these kids I recognise yeah from back back in the day he's dead that one there
B	would you say it gives you positive feelings?
C	yes positive not negative no but it was like that was
B	he's passed I take it? he's quite old
C	oh he's long past yeah he was old then that's
B	oh wow yeah was a bit of an old timer already
C	yeah he was
B	so it was run by the church?
C	yeah erm diesis of Saint Albans
B	yeah does this concept still exist? church running homes for people?
C	I don't know but I mean this place would have been closed down under health and safety you know the things that you used to have then which were accepted as the norm but not now
B	what like?
C	just the food was awful and stuff like that I told you all the stories
B	yeah
C	erm that was
B	I take it you had chores to do?
C	yeah
B	you had to do things and like you know
C	yeah in the kitchen
B	you had to cook?
C	no never cook no they had cooks for that but we had to wash up and lay the tables and do spuds and erm on Saturday not on spuds on any other day bar Saturday er you did that
B	oh gosh
C	you did it Saturday for Sunday
B	presumably the older you were the more chores you had?
C	yeah but even the youngsters got in you had to clean your shoes every day
B	ah
C	you had a shoes bag and then you'd wash er
B	are they just camping or is that where you stayed?
C	yeah that's at Great Yarmouth
B	yeah okay
C	erm erm it that's
B	I mean what was your room like in like how many people did you share with and that
C	well well probably that could have been me there I was just thinking that might have been
B	that was very quick
C	I'll freeze it the bed one
C	that could be me there
B	oh unpause it and pause it again see if it oh just seems too quick yeah
C	no see it just doesn't doesn't it it's going like bilio we were we used er one time it was like six of you in a bedroom
B	yeah
C	so that's
B	so that that was normal?
C	yes that chaps there
B	yeah it was really blonde
C	yeah that's
C	yeah no
C	god knows so I mean there's a possibility I'm on some of the
B	that one that you showed was pretty clear
C	yeah
B	that that was you wasn't it?
C	yeah I'll go back to that you can see that that's er that's a bit of my one of my ex er
B	there's a pier at Great Yarmouth then as well?
C	yeah er
B	so Great Yarmouth is Norfolk is it?
C	yes
B	just directly east of here?

C	god my hair was long
B	definitely you
C	yeah you can see it's me can't you? it does you can see

B	you didn't question anything wasn't
C	no not really
B	no resentment
C	no I questioned it years later but I didn't question it at the time you just got on got on with it there's too much to occupy your mind er erm
B	and you're not alone are you? there are lots of people in the same situation so
C	for introspection yeah that was a
C	yeah
B	well people look like they're having fun

A	mm
B	strange could you tell when they were younger what they were gonna look like when they're older? would you say your image in your mind was correct or
A	erm
C	hello
A	I don't I don't think not until they begin
C	I'm so sorry to disappoint you
A	younger versions of
B	I suppose as well mothers usually don't like to think too much about their children getting too old do they?
C	yes it did yes all the cards arrived
A	I mean you don't the thing is that when you think of the time that from sort of like when you're born and this teeny little baby type thing and when you get to about five years old from five onwards you don't change that dramatically like you did and that's why I like to keep them it's just to remind them that you know how lovely they
C	yes so thanks very much for that I'll find a good home for the wine and obviously erm I'll put the erm money towards some clothing or something and and
B	they're really nice where are you putting
A	oh I'm going I'm gonna put the three on here cos
B	mm
A	and those three so those three'll go up there somewhere and then these I'm just gonna scatter them all all sort of there cos that's my niece the one that's in London in erm university
B	oh what's her name?
A	my brothers
B	we've never met have we I don't think?
A	no you have
C	he he's come up from Brighton
A	and the other two are
B	we have met I think?
A	pardon? you've met
B	yeah yeah
C	yes he is to be honest though when we took him down there
B	is
A	yeah
B	yeah and on the right?
B	sorry I'm terrible with names
A	no
B	I struggle to remember took me so long to get
A	well no say when you yeah but then you've got to and the thing is if you look at them now if you could see
B	it's downstairs
A	yeah that's how sort of the short space of time nothing changed
B	yeah grow up quick don't they?
A	yeah
B	I had a actually I can show you I had erm sorry I'll put this down here I had a photo
A	oh right
B	like a student thing and I took a passport photo and I thought oh my gosh I'm looking thirty almost I really didn't like it at all
A	god you he looks so like your father
A	gosh
B	I just think I'm definitely looking older
A	you don't look anywhere near as
B	no I don't well
A	mine is disgusting
B	I've got this one as my student ID this one I must have taken a few years ago cos it's on my passport photo and everyone says that I look terribly aggressive in this photo and the guy that printed it off asked me if I actually wanted to have a different photo put in it
A	you do
B	I think it's just me with a relaxed face but everyone's like well you look like you're gonna beat someone up in that photo or something
A	but I think the difference by putting your beard on makes you look so different I mean you've got a much fuller beard you've got full on
B	yeah
A	and it softens your face
B	so don't shave the beard off any more
A	no I like you with a
A	where's dad's beard then?
C	there's a message for you?
A	hello ah
B	have you seen this photo dad? I was just saying to
C	yes yeah yeah
B	I had to have a new one taken for my erm railcard and I think god you start looking at yourself and thinking I do look older now
C	yes yes
B	starting to look about thirty
C	yes yes cos you're getting that way yeah
C	dear oh dear yeah you can see a similarity
B	whereas the one I use this old one for my passport everyone says I look really aggressive in this shot
C	yes
B	they guy that printed it off even asked me if I wanted another photo taken
B	and I was like why? what's wrong with it? it's just
C	yes it's cos your hair's all screwed and pulled right back isn't it? yeah
B	oh right yeah
C	yes yeah you look hard you look hardened there
B	but I didn't like that photo when I printed it off I was like oh
C	oh well age
B	old
C	yes yes
B	I think
C	oh
B	no definitely not see I've got this erm
C	can just cos well well done really good news I just passed the phone over to you so she could tell you personally yes well I'm very I'm very pleased with that I didn't have a doubt that he wouldn't wouldn't fail it to be honest I thought he'd pass
B	what happened?
C	er
C	yeah
B	they all part of the same family?
C	yeah
B	I'm a bit confused as to
C	er
B	are they brothers and sisters?
C	yep these two are
B	okay
C	so they all drive now obviously
B	is this
C	yes
B	okay
C	you've met her
B	yeah okay I'm just terrible with names
C	you recognise her?
B	yeah
C	that's
B	okay
C	that's the brother
B	so there's
C	yeah
B	and they have a brother
C	yes no no cousin
B	cousins oh right
C	er
B	okay
B	I haven't met either of them have I?
C	yeah you've I think you possibly met one
B	oh
B	oh okay
B	oh okay that's why I'm getting confused
B	okay
C	no no no no don't drive but
B	terrible
C	yeah
B	different priorities
C	well you have had the priorities I mean I would I would recommend that sometime that you get a driving licence because it
B	do you wanna pay for it?
C	no you pay for it
C	erm because it's useful erm
B	it is
C	in your line of job in your line of work it possibly might not be in
B	there are some jobs I mean if I want a job in Japan pretty much a standard of
C	licence yeah
B	I'd have to get one to go to Japan
C	I'm surprised that you didn't kind of get one in another country where it was easier because you could have used it here
B	I think I said to you had I once I got the job at the uni
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	then have it but we that never happened I may end up I think it's probably easier to learn to drive in a foreign country than it is in England
C	well in terms of you're probably gonna live abroad somewhere
B	yeah
C	you're gonna be driving on the other side of the road so why not learn to drive on that side yes I would
B	it would be nice to be able to rent a car here and there if I needed one although
C	yes only with a licence that enables you to do that
B	my er friends really want us to come and visit them again in America and they wanna do a big road trip
C	yes
B	and I think it would be nice if I could share some of the some of the driving
C	yes you've gotta take a turn of the driving yeah that's a good experience right the last one to to is little sis
A	pardon? little sis
B	you good with numbers then?
B	oh did you make this?
A	we make this everything the bow the box
B	brilliant
A	the whole box is all handmade
B	how long does it take to make something like that?
A	well we were only there two hours and we did two so that comes like that and there you go that comes like that
B	oh wow that's brilliant yeah
A	erm I have to have something to do now I don't go to work
B	no of course

B	okay
A	erm and that all the whatever we do and usually do two cards a week so like the purple one and the one that was on there er the ones that we did the week before last but er
