A	what does it actually taste like? truffle
B	er
A	right
C	try a bit
A	I didn't wanna not like it though and then have to like
B	that oh that looks cute down there
C	we've bought some spaghetti as well we've got spaghetti we've got olive oil we've got garlic and we've got that now
B	and some chillies
A	yeah
C	we've got some chillies we can make that
B	it's just very we could we we won't use all of that
C	oh no yeah it's obviously
B	I just thought that was quite unusual the sausage with
A	the truffles
B	yeah
C	perhaps we weren't meant to
B	this is a
C	oh yeah
A	oh is this the canal thing?
B	no this leads down to the bay where the oysters
A	I think I was half asleep when you were talking about this
B	let's hope they have a
D	there's a cave there there's er caves? do you want to go and look at the caves?
A	yeah I'm not I'm not a cave person I must say
C	do caves not do it for you?
A	I had a distressing experience
C	oh dear you've had a lot of distressful experiences
D	have you? yeah what happened to you then?
A	I have I know I mean
D	in a cave?
A	on the Ardeche there was this like manmade cave that if you they called it caving and you used to
B	did you?
A	yeah it were grim
B	oh love
A	honestly I've never
B	you've never told me about it did you keep it to yourself? oh love
A	it was horrible I hated it
B	it's like potholing does the same thing
C	potholing?
B	mm
C	what's that?
B	it's like caving
D	thought you were going the birth canal mate
B	you did have
C	well yeah but
B	a tight squeeze
A	oh
C	yeah you see and I didn't
B	get stuffed you
C	I didn't have as tight a squeeze
D	oh god strewth
C	cos I was smaller and I don't have flashbacks to my birth
D	aye oh
B	it's really mm
D	eh?
B	it it sort of re-conjures those feelings conjures
C	bloody Nora you
C	eat the food off of my plate
D	oh dear
B	stick it up your left nostril
D	oh breathe through your left nostril
A	wonder what Dr
B	we might see him
B	Dr
B	I think you can just drive there
A	come on
B	I think that's what we should get
C	yeah
B	he'd appreciate that
C	he'll like that
A	he does like cooking does our
B	he likes cooking
C	he likes cooking
B	and we'll get
C	although that that carrot cake you made was
B	it was really good
C	really good
B	I'm sorry I didn't eat any more
C	I know well I ate loads of it
B	what did you do with it guys?
C	cos these two didn't I ate it
B	did you?
A	I don't like I don't like carrot cake
B	the only thing I'd have put in was raisins he said he didn't like raisins in carrot cake
C	right
A	oh
C	it stayed cos he'd made it will all with erm oil it stayed really moist
B	yeah it was really good
C	didn't dry out
A	nowt worse than dry cake
B	and what did he put in the cheese? cream cheese and
C	I think it was probably cream cheese cream and sugar I think
A	oh was that cream cheese
C	uhu
B	is it straight on to Rovinj?
D	I think so
B	I thought it said go back in the book but
C	well show you the map
D	I think it's up here a bit and then turn right I
C	started off at Porec
A	that sounds very confusing
B	yeah the book describes just going back but
A	that's a blind corner that innit?
B	it is
C	that was an excellent cake that was better than our cake at properly a slice of that and
B	cup of tea
C	mm
B	cakes are
C	they're better aren't they? airy
B	yeah
C	and just taste of nothing
B	artificial
C	we do a proper cake
B	even not cakes our fruit tarts are better aren't they?
C	everything abroad is like like you know like where the birthday cakes are like looking like this glistening
B	yeah
C	like frosting
B	yeah just like that
C	I always used to want a Costco birthday cake cos that was always
B	did you?
C	mm
B	rather than the one I'd made?
C	mm it wasn't that I didn't want the one you'd made I just thought that you know like
B	that was the thing to do
C	cos you could have your name iced on it and everything
B	yeah
C	it's alright
A	we had a horrible childhood didn't we
A	yeah
C	cruising
B	so yeah you've been you've gotta be careful with those truffles once you open them
C	mm
B	that was my thought well how did they stay fresh?
A	well when you sterilise it all the microorganisms can't respire so they die then
C	yeah
A	they they
B	but then she was saying you've gotta keep some moisture in there so they don't
C	dry out
B	yeah
C	mm interesting her saying about in posh restaurants where they give you a meal
B	yeah and then you
C	and they give you your erm
B	gold grater
C	they they give it you at the side and you grate how much you want
A	thing is though you might get if you do a naff job somebody else might get the manky leftovers of yours do you understand what I mean? if you do a naff job grating do you understand what I'm trying to say or not?
C	no
A	I'm
B	it to be honest it's it's like a slice
C	but it's like a wafer thin slice isn't it? it's like you know like the cheese slicer?
B	that's why I feel like I I've never seen any I've seen I think what's it called though the one who does all things it like what's that?
A	Heston Blumenthal
B	yeah I've seen him grate truffles into something but I would imagine it's like overwhelming if you're having just a thin slice
C	mm well
B	of it
C	yeah
B	you could taste it in there
C	it's so strong
B	and that's why I think we'd be better I don't
C	okay
B	but if you can make your own oil maybe it's better to get some oil
C	grate a bit in
B	buy one truffle and could make our own oil
C	I think one truffle's a lot though isn't it?
B	no you could make like three or four bottles couldn't you?
C	yeah I was saying
A	how much
B	depends on the size of
C	there was one that that was eight
A	eight quid?
B	was it?
C	yeah eight pounds
A	oh that's not that bad
B	it said eighty
A	if you can make
A	if you can make three bottles out of that that's you know three pound a bottle that's not that bad
B	did you mean eighty
D	do what t'internet says
B	yeah so about a tenner
C	it was er erm
B	yeah
C	and that that was where we tasted it was really good and I think that had bits of shaved truffle as well
A	where does Jamie Oliver even like live now? is it?
B	Primrose Hill
C	no he oh I thought he lived in erm Essex like in Sussex
B	no well they've got a house off Primrose Hill
A	where's that?
C	London
B	the
C	the posh bit
A	have you seen the erm you know James Cordon's Carpool?
C	mm
A	he did one with the Red Hot Chili Peppers
C	mm
B	oh did he?
A	yeah they all whipped off their tops and started singing Californication
C	yeah
B	oh
A	er yeah but we might have to wait till we get home but
B	yeah well when we're on our last day you can do it for me cos we won't mind then
A	yeah
C	street food?
A	street food yeah and apparently James Cordon had bought like pulled over and bought them all tacos and stuff and erm apparently like one of the like this
C	how have you heard this story?
A	it was linked from Facebook today
B	recently then?
A	no they they did the carpool recently and he he so I'm saying James Cordon pulled over bought them all tacos
B	and then there was this kid who was choking?
A	then there was this kid who was choking and his mum didn't know what to do so I think he gave him Heimlich manoeuvre
A	yeah
C	where were we when that like a fourteen-year-old fat boy was stuffing his face and he started choking? do you remember?
B	no
C	you you did the Heimlich on him
C	do you not remember?
B	no
C	we were in a shop somewhere and his mum was just his mum said oh he does it all the time it's cos he stuffs his face too much
C	so like literally this teenage boy was like he was proper fat started choking cos he'd stuffed his face with too many peanuts or something
A	what the fans?
A	the funniest thing I've seen was
B	this
A	no
B	oh
A	he was like close to tears it was so funny
B	oh it sounds it
C	how can you be allergic to pineapple? that's like the weirdest thing
A	innit
C	to be allergic to what happens to him?
C	no I mean what happens to him when he has it?
A	erm he like I dunno he apparently like his throat like swells up and stuff I don't know
C	he can't have been if he was alright
D	especially when it's called Hawaiian
C	it is
A	it was so funny
C	if you're if you're like chomping into a pizza you'd think you'd notice
B	you should sea look and the spires of Rovinj
C	the spires of Rovinj
B	I knew you were gonna do that
A	are you gonna write some your memoirs down when you're older
C	oh do you know what I could nibble?
B	oh for god's sake
B	you've just stuffed your face with pork and chips
C	stuffed my face?
C	stuffed my face? I'm like I'm hungry is anybody else hungry? no no no you get it for yourself
B	we didn't
C	and then
B	me and
C	anyway what I could fancy is you know when we were at the
B	was that where they had all the shells?
C	on the floor yeah
A	yeah oh I'll tell you what I could do with like either a Chipotle or like an American Five Guys cos it it's not the same Five Guys over here
C	it's not the same
B	it's not no
C	and it's so expensive
A	yeah
A	yeah do you not remember the first time we went to Five Guys and we had? no
C	I remember all the
A	it was when we were driving to
C	peninsula
C	it was we were driving
B	the quays
C	back
A	it was so good and then Chipotle that were you didn't enjoy it but I loved that Chipotle it was so nice
C	they've got Chipotle in the UK as well
A	I know but again I don't think it would be the same
C	what's
A	Taco Bell was disappointing I was expecting more from Taco Bell
D	have you been to this
A	yeah but it's an absolute fortune
C	I told you it was a Chipotle when I was in
A	yeah that's what Chipotle is
C	right anyway well I hadn't seen it so there was one like that so I didn't know how it worked so there
A	oh that's nice
C	nice
B	try that every time you go now
A	yeah like er

C	it was absolutely excellent and it was even better cos it was free
B	it was free
A	I tell you what I could do with like a Chipotle and one of them gallon go one of them
C	Mountain Dew
A	oh
B	do you still like that?
A	it's so nice especially the
C	do you remember? it was him and him
C	sat in back slurping them and we were just waiting for them to like literally explode out the car
A	it's so good
D	you just said you won't drink Coke cos it's bad for you
A	yeah dad when
C	except Mountain Dew
A	when do I ever drink Mountain Dew? once a holiday you know
C	doesn't taste as E numbery
A	no
D	oh right
A	cos if you buy it in the UK it doesn't taste as nice there
A	I'd be so fat if I lived in America cos cos I'd just I'd
C	I would be I'd be really fat
A	I'd go to Chipotle like every day
C	it's it would be so easy to be fat wouldn't it?
A	innit?
B	well you know I couldn't believe the these blueberry pancakes
C	huge
B	two the size of the plate she brought it on they weren't like like
C	and I bet I bet she was like oh I'll never get through that and then she did
B	well no I'd ordered them
C	oh for you?
B	yeah I'd ordered these blueberry pancakes they had blueberries in and they'd put blueberries on top
C	yeah
B	with er a dollop of erm
C	oh right yeah
B	it was nice
C	instead of syrup?
B	er oh no and maple syrup
C	right
B	they came in two erm tubs er well it's not maple is it? they're called pancake syrup
C	yeah
B	no look at the sun on the water
C	go on
A	I saw this really
C	and then pour pancake yeah
A	that cake mixture all over it and as it as it cooks it like it like dissipates and like
C	it would be alright if I liked Nutella
A	do you not like Nutella? oh right
C	no
B	I do though
A	I'll make it when
C	I don't like
B	I'll make it when we get back
C	I don't like hazelnuts though
D	I believe there's a pancake maker at home isn't there? didn't I buy one?
C	yeah you bought a
D	same thing
C	never used it ever
A	when do we ever have waffles though? let's be serious
D	maybe I'll have waffles when we get home
A	I'll have waffles and pancakes when we get home
C	I like waffles as well proper
A	I'm not a fan of waffles
C	are you not? I like them
A	unless it's got like
C	waffles
A	I tell you what I do like though crepes crepes are like er Nutella and banana yes
C	see I'd rather have a waffle than a crepe
B	should get a picture there
C	oh it's just right up ahead isn't it?
A	oh that's a nice Porsche oh two Porsches
C	Porsche
A	I do like the Porsches
B	I think that's the island erm
A	go on geographer
B	where Tito was
C	oh
A	oh he sang his praises didn't he that bloke? erm
B	did he?
A	yeah he was like our president Tito which is very nice to see oh our president Tito is a wonderful fellow yeah I mean whatever I don't know the bloke personally but
C	I think he was a communist dictator
A	yeah he was
C	parking
A	you need to just say right
A	I don't think it makes a difference actually
C	Rovinj
A	need a ticket
D	no
C	there?
A	yeah
B	oh there's space just there
D	go where?
B	right to the top of it the third one down you know then we've come all this way to walk
A	you are lazy mum
B	you haven't seen how far we've gotta walk up there
A	oh is there a big? oh there's another Porsche that's very nice they like Porsches round here that's not so nice
B	that's sweet
C	mm
A	there's many spaces
C	yeah it's it's a bit princessy that one
D	where's this one?
B	right at the end
A	there
B	on your right
B	it might have been that one but it's this one
C	I can't drive in
B	I can't drive in
A	it's gonna be hard getting out here
C	you've got loads of room there
A	loads of room are you having a laugh?
C	let's go and have a vino
D	three 0 three
A	so are we going on the toll road or not? oh no don't have your window down
C	what do you wanna do dad?
D	oh we'll get there it's no big deal
C	well what way? the toll?
D	I think your way has a toll as well to be honest with you
C	I don't think it is
D	well
C	no it's not all the way up the coast it's the way I just pointed out to you
A	mum will you please close your window it's really hurting my ears
D	well just open another
C	I think
D	window a little bit is it?
C	I think your way is more out of the way
C	but it's your decision you're the driver and I should let you take the decision can I have a few more grapes?
B	go on have two
A	enjoy everything
C	gonna enjoy every single grape quite nice to be fair aren't they?
A	is there any water left mum?
C	no
B	thank you
A	I think there's some kind of music festival going on
B	are we recording darling?
A	we are
B	that was nice
C	are we on the three three 0 three now?
D	yeah
B	I like the way they do their er roundabouts
A	circle rounds
C	circle rounds
B	circle rounds yeah
C	mm
A	I dunno er are cigarettes cheaper? I don't know
D	yeah
A	are they?
C	can't imagine
D	I think I saw about twenty-five a packet or something
A	sorry?
D	about twenty-five kuna a packet
C	quite cheap
B	how do you know?
D	I saw it in a shop just then
A	it's like three quid innit?
C	that's less than three pound
B	saw what
C	he saw it in a shop
D	it was three quid
A	for how many?
D	pack of twenty?
C	that's very cheap
D	don't even know how much are they a tenner or something?
C	yeah well depending on what pack you buy between seven pound and a tenner
A	oh thanks
C	you're welcome
A	oh
C	depends if you're going for Marlboro
A	well why is Marlboro the best?
C	no LandB Blue
A	what's like what's the more?
C	LandB Blue were the cheaper version of LandB
A	what's so what's?
C	so basically they put less tobacco in and more cack in
A	so is Marlboro the best?
C	mm
D	best for killing you yeah
C	Marlboros are very strong they've got a lot of erm whatever it is in nicotine tobacco
A	thing is none of us smoke so why
C	I no because I've worked on the tobacco
A	yeah I know I get that
B	there's a house right on top of a hill there to your right
A	so what else do they stick
C	mm I don't know really but like
A	I don't know
C	not nice stuff
B	I don't I'd is the nicotine an intrinsic part of the tobacco?
C	I thought so
B	I truly don't know
A	cos I read once that they put rat poison in but I don't know if that was a lie
C	I don't think it's rat poison
B	I've heard that stuff that's sold on the black market
C	yeah
B	they put all kinds of rubbish in well it's all rubbish isn't it?
A	no I don't smoke
B	it's had a huge
A	well lung cancer's the most common cancer isn't it?
B	is it? it's the most poorly treated
C	I thought pancreatic is the more poorly treated
B	I don't think pancreatic's as common is it?
C	it's not no it's got a very low survival rate
B	yeah
C	mm that's what my friend who shaved her head was raising money for
B	pancreatic cancer?
C	yeah I think her grandad had died from it so she was raising money for it
B	the thing is you can't survive without your pancreas can you?
C	no well I didn't understand on Twenty-Four Hours in A and E was it? or something like that no it wasn't that I can't remember what programme it was erm well I saw it on Gogglebox there was erm
A	oh yeah
C	gave it and his dad gave his but I said how would his dad survive without a liver?
B	no you can take a
C	oh
B	I mean it is amazing cos you've got your hepatic portal there and you've got all the blood vessels that support it they must have used his existing blood vessels to er
C	right anyway they gave it him and it
A	rejected
C	failed within forty-eight hours and this little boy
B	oh
C	was really really ill so they bumped him up the organ donor list and like six weeks later he he got erm he got a transplant and erm he was doing well but you can imagine his dad went through all that and then he rejects it the little boy
B	they must have done tissue typing
C	they must have done yeah
B	yeah
C	but he said he said like literally forty-eight hours after the surgery they knew it hadn't gone well
A	I wonder could they have not used stem cells to like?
B	well they're trying to do that now aren't they? they're er using stem cells to grow organs
C	mm there was erm a stem cell thing that was on erm that the vet was doing the super-vet he it was erm er what's it called? where the ball and socket in your hip doesn't form properly?
B	mm
C	where the sockets aren't
B	yeah he did
C	what's it called? and he and he erm injected stem cells and it reformed
B	it grew the cup part
C	it it it
B	it grew the
C	was like a socket part better than it was what's it called that?
B	what?
C	that condition
B	hip displacement
C	that's the one
A	I can't believe people are against stem cells it's such a
C	why are people against it?
A	it's cos they're taken from embryos so they say it's like
B	sometimes they are but we've got a company in at the hospital collecting erm stem cells from placentas
A	yeah you can do it from placentas umbilical cords
C	oh so like are they gonna ask for if they want to donate?
B	yeah well they can pay to have their own saved or if they just donate the blood from the placenta er the hospital gets about a tenner for it but the company is is it's
C	right
A	doing it it's called
C	is it proper?
C	right
A	I think it's a really really cool thing to do I mean we learned about it in biology it's really clever how they do it
C	so women can pay to have their
B	yeah
C	stem
B	the baby
C	stored from the placenta?
B	yeah
C	or they can donate it?
B	or they can just donate it to er then I presume they sell it on
C	you'd just keep it wouldn't you? in case your child ever needed it
B	well you would but you don't you don't need that really
C	you don't need all of it
C	to be honest I don't know I don't know what I think about donating it so someone else can sell it for a profit
B	yeah I know
C	donate it so that someone
B	can make money from it
C	yeah well well I was gonna say to help you know like if somebody needed a new liver or whatever not donate for someone else to make a fortune
B	I I questioned them about it and they
D	it's not gonna happen unless someone makes a profit
B	they're dead shady about it
C	I was gonna say it sounds a bit questionable
D	yeah but
C	do the women know that they're donating it to be sold?
B	well they don't give them all the information but I've asked and asked and asked them
C	how many women do it?
B	they're not well organised enough cos they the the they work from seven in the morning till eight at night at the moment but they're
C	these two women?
B	yeah er but they're gonna be twenty-four hours soon
C	right
B	erm cos they have to collect
C	so they can collect them quickly?
B	yeah they have to collect it within
A	is it just those two women running it?
B	they're working for
A	well they must
B	but there were other companies that used to come in before I've collected it before now
C	mm
B	when it first started
C	how long ago?
B	about ten years ago
C	right
B	er no probably be more like about twelve years ago cos I was working in
C	mm
B	and we'd take it from the placenta and they and then ring the company and they'd come and send a van and collect it take it off for processing
C	how much do people pay for it?
B	and then they spent two thousand pound
A	wow
B	it's worth it though
A	so people spend two grand on a pram?
B	yeah it's ridiculous yeah I'd rather have a second hand pram and do that and save your baby's stem cells
A	I dunno why you'd save the baby's stem cells though
B	well if they if they had a problem
C	because if if if in the
A	yeah
B	an illness
C	in the future
B	I suppose in they first used it for leukaemia so if a child developed leukaemia they could use the stem cells to just inject the bone marrow
A	yeah but those conditions are extremely hard to find
B	no in the laboratory
A	trust me mum we've done about it in biology they're trying to find the way different the different like so they tested different conditions and what those different conditions do to the way that the cells
C	reproduce
A	no it's called right basically a stem cell is an undifferentiated cell
C	yeah
A	so before when a cell is formed it's not a a a liver cell or a
C	yeah exactly it's just cell
B	heart cell and a
C	yeah yeah
A	so an undifferentiated cell means that it's not picked what it is cell it is yet basically
C	yeah
A	so I'm saying scientists are trying to find the conditions needed to turn the cells in a
B	oh I know but I what I'm saying is in the raw form as an
C	yeah
B	undifferentiated cell
C	it can just
B	they can just inject that they can just reproduce
A	oh yeah sorry I didn't right yeah I understand
B	so that's what I'm saying
A	yeah
C	I didn't think
C	yeah I I it's not I didn't think it was like they've got a stem cell and then they grow a liver in a test tube they inject those to wherever it is in that and you within your body it it works I thought is that right?
B	no but they're trying to grow organs now from stem cells
C	right
B	so they're trying to
C	so like in vitro stems?
A	they've worked on mice and rats I know that
B	they yeah they've been putting them into a pig haven't they? they've just injected they took a they grew a heart in a pig
C	right
A	they've been growing insulin in pigs for years haven't they?
C	and then what do they take it out of the pig then and put it in a human?
B	mm
C	so it is a bit questionable
A	yeah but
C	I suppose
A	a pig for a human you know
C	yeah absolutely if you know if it was
D	bacon sandwich?
C	pick apple pork
B	she just kept saying to me it's a charity it's a charity or something
C	yeah do they speak good English?
B	mm not bad
C	yeah
B	the thing is they've not got themselves well organised enough they come let so they'll come up to the birth suite and say is anyone in labour? what woman wants to talk about that
C	yeah
B	when she's giving birth?
C	I was gonna say
B	they need to do it antenatally
C	surely it should be something that they discuss with people beforehand and get them to agree to it beforehand
B	yeah
C	but you know like anyone who not being nasty but anyone who would understand why they would want their stem cells would surely want to save them for themselves
A	sorry I don't
C	for their child?
A	understand what you're saying
C	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah I I suppose
C	like like why would you agree to giving away the stem cells for some
B	you'd be amazed
C	being completely
B	how few take or take it up
C	what to
B	I don't
C	to donate it?
B	mm like erm
C	or to keep them?
B	no take them
D	I think it's the road to Rijeka isn't it
C	I'm checking it
B	yeah
C	I'd have I'd have still gone the other way I don't know mum I don't know how
A	let's see how much the toll is
B	you won't know till you're coming off
C	oh it tells you up there
A	can you see?
C	depends how far you go
D	the and the map's too small to tell you the name of the road that takes you up to Montovun?
C	I think there is no name for it dad it's just you come off from Pazin
D	Pazin?
C	I think it's called junction three if I'm reading this map right
A	certainly a cool thing to think about isn't it? you know in er ten years' time we'll be able to replace entire organs
B	well it's such a gift isn't it?
A	I
B	to be able to do that
A	have I told you about
C	what's that?
A	we did about it in chemistry it's about basically you
D	look at the size of that
C	don't know
D	sorry yeah I'm listening
A	erm a hundred atoms like you know erm
D	oh so it leads to
A	erm and basically you can make these things called
B	fullerenes?
A	yeah and er basically they're tubes of carbon erm and they're being used like in like lubricants erm all sorts of stuff and basically nanomedicine is the hope is through these carbon tubes called fullerenes you'll be able to direct medicine medicine directly to cells so like
B	okay
A	so like
C	so like the cancerous cells?
A	yeah so you so say with like not just cancer but like all types of cells like you know if you take a medicine it might damage your other cells and get you a bit groggy? in like the future hopefully it'll just be able to target individual cells like that and then you'll recover quickly I thought it was really really clever
B	they're saying that about diets in the future though aren't they? you know
C	what?
B	not everyone everyone processes food differently
C	differently yeah
A	mum would you speak up? I can't hear what you're saying
B	they're saying everyone processes food differently
A	right
B	so the idea is is that they'll be individually er like genetically er organise diets certain foods'll
A	oh so you'll
B	work better
A	right I understand what you're saying so you'll like it's you'll be like
C	you'll have a genetic test and then they'll tell you
A	yeah
C	how you how you digest bread or
A	yeah that's clever
B	it's like different have different body shapes don't they? you know you store fat in different places
C	well it's like erm
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and don't have a shape
C	yeah why is that?
B	why is that? it's like it's like they've got a more android digestion that that I suppose cos men are more prone to heart disease than women aren't they?
C	strange
A	this road is dead isn't it?
C	pardon?
A	this road's dead
B	my ears are popping
A	are they?
C	it might be picking up a lot of the erm
A	that's what I was thinking
C	road noise or resting on that I don't know
A	hopefully it will be
A	I'm really hungry
B	you had that water didn't you?
A	yeah
B	when we get in?
A	yeah
B	erm don't I'll probably have a cup of tea while we make something to eat
C	yeah
B	we need to make sure we bring everything in as well in case it rains again
A	what outside?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	are we gonna go out tomorrow or stay in?
B	don't know
A	I vote stay but it's up to you guys
B	you vote stay in?
A	I vote stay in but it's up to you guys
B	are you feeling more relaxed
A	not really no I still have a I still keep having moments where I keep like having little I dunno
B	having little what love?
A	like moments like
B	you were the same weren't you?
C	I honestly can't remember it's so long ago but I'm sure I was

C	oh
A	I dunno if you know mum but you know like in American high school?
D	three?
C	yeah well it's exit three that you need I can't see a
D	I know and I thought this was exit two really
C	you thought this well er
B	it says three on it
D	it said three on the
B	sorry
A	I was saying that like in American high school erm like twenty-five percent or
D	so Pazin
C	this is the only exit before Pazin
D	is it? well it says Pazin straight on
C	well I'm looking at the map and it's the only exit before Pazin as far as I can see
A	cos like
C	and I can't see the name of the road to pick up to get up to get onto to Motovun
D	I know it's such a it's such a poor map
A	this to me like American high school seems like kind of easy in comparison cos you do like loads of like you don't really cos you test on well you so you
D	oh here you are Motovun three hundred yards
A	like I know like twenty percent is participation and then like fifteen percent is like projects you know like you'll do a project on I don't know Mount Everest or something it just seems like really really easy dunno maybe it's just me yeah but then you take that massive SAT test don't you where it's like five and a half hours of like maths English science
B	I don't know
A	yeah
D	let's have a look
A	your SAT like decides whether you which uni you go to and stuff
D	thank you
D	thirteen what have we got here? no
C	what if you put a ten and then you've got some coins? you've got a ten note in your wallet
D	have you got my wallet haven't you
C	no I did I give it to you? oh
D	two

C	no dad top right bank bill
D	oh right
C	I think oh no maybe not I don't know I don't know
D	no I don't think it's that oh almost there yeah that's the right way
A	sorted
D	sorted
C	says Pazin left
A	do you know toll roads? are they not run by the government? is it like private companies that run them?
D	well private companies put the money in to put them in in the first place
C	can you pop your window please dad it's cold
A	yeah so then they'll so they'll obviously take the profit won't they? so it's it's private companies
D	yeah
B	they usually are
A	I just can't think as much money cos it must cost you know millions of pounds and if one pound seventy-five per person
D	not gonna build much of a road is it?
C	yeah bear in mind it's a Monday evening at half eight it's I'm sure it's
C	busier
A	that's true

D	no we'll do it tomorrow
A	you can see
C	mm
B	cos
C	is that what he's rushing for?

B	yeah
D	and spent a pound
A	it was you they're not wrong though are they? let's face it

A	trying to tell me what team we're playing I know more about football than you
C	no but you said why don't we drive up to Slovenia to watch the match as if you were playing Slovenia that would make sense
A	why I didn't say that dad did
