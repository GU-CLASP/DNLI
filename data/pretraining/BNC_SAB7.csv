A	it's probably just
C	no
A	oh I see
C	as he is now rather than as he was when he was younger
A	I don't really know Tom Baker that well all I know about him is that he used to narrate Little Britain yeah I I thought

B	Tom Baker Anthony who?
C	in that Four in a Bed last night
B	oh right oh yes yes
C	that's who I I'm not saying he looked like him particularly
B	no no
C	but he kind of
A	no it wasn't that for me
C	it was ridiculous
A	that it looks like a comedy sketch when they're sitting there talking cos
A	it looked like a comedy sketch it reminded me of like something that would have gone in Little Britain or something
C	might I have that was that is a stupid thing to say
A	might I have
C	you might you might not depends what I bring you

A	I know you were annoying last night
A	from the moment you got out of bed
B	who was?
C	he's back on whisky and he's different when he's on whisky he's not he's not aggressive but you know just really annoying but not funny annoying

C	ah thanks darl this is lovely
B	hm?
B	what?
C	I think that's orange juice in Spanish
B	oh no mate
C	can you do any conversations in Spanish
A	very simplistic
C	what again? you spoke to him yesterday morning how many times a day do you speak?
A	no I didn't Skype him yesterday morning I skyped him yesterday evening
B	on her telephone
C	you were ah you were skyping him when I got home when I got up
A	I know I just quickly rang him before bed
C	ah what on Viber?
A	yeah
C	oh yeah it's good Viber isn't it?
A	and then dad kept standing behind me going
A	and then he tried to make a video of me but my conversation ended before he could put his phone on
B	I wanted to show you
C	did you?
B	to annoy
C	I heard her yesterday when I went to the loo I would have popped in to say hello but I was stark naked at the time
A	oh yeah
A	no that would have been a bit embarrassing
C	might have been a bit awkward
A	yeah
A	don't think he wants to see you naked
C	I don't think I want him to see me naked
B	mm
A	mm this breakfast is good thank dad thanks dad
C	this is yum yum
A	this is yummy scrummy in my tummy
C	you think they'll take all the erm recycling at the side of the bins?
B	well
C	mm
A	I guess everyone would if they over the Christmas period they
C	I know
A	I don't suppose the actual bin men actually give a poo do they?
C	no well they do
A	I don't suppose they give a poo they'll probably just take it
B	ours is you can't get into ours so old bottles
C	I know
B	you can't get into his because it's one
C	well that's what he fills up his thing cos he's an obsessive cleaner isn't he?
B	yeah yeah there's loads of spray
A	so bad for the environment
C	I know and he hasn't got a washing line so I can only think that summer no matter what time of year he tumble dries everything
A	tumble dries
C	he never hangs his clothes up
A	well
C	I know I get a bit embarrassed about our recycling bin sometimes
A	well what would you rather have a recycling bin full of aerosols or a recycling bin full of wine bottles
C	I think it shows the difference in lifestyle
A	I think it shows the very difference in lifestyle I'd rather have your one
B	he's clean and we're pissed
A	yeah
B	shamble with his
C	living in squalor
A	or he's boring and you have fun
B	ah that's another way of looking at it
A	did they have anyone round for Christmas?
C	don't know they had a really boring
C	I can't imagine what they do the three of them
A	just probably really boring like probably just watched Christmas telly
C	he doesn't eat turkey oh no I don't think she is
C	cos I think I remember him saying he cooked meat for them but he wouldn't eat it
A	why because he cares about animal rights yeah? he likes
C	yeah but then he'll go out on the field and feed all the sheep up making them nice and plump ready for our dinner
A	he's a kind man
C	he does associate better with animals than humans that's true
A	I'm surprised they never got another cat after
A	after
C	I think they were too traumatised
A	we just every time ours disappear we
B	you remember when
C	yeah
A	he went the same time as
C	mm more or less and that's why I think cos they were both quite long haired
A	yeah I think they were stolen
C	I I think they were taken
A	ah I hope they weren't tortured
C	no I hope they were taken for nice reasons
B	for floppiness reasons
C	mm
A	yeah no one took old short-haired
C	no
A	well what would you do with a long-haired cat?
C	well I don't know
A	is there a market for cat fur?
C	oh well I don't know what about the one hundred and one Dalmatians
A	yeah but that's a Dalmatian fur
C	I don't know
A	a rug?
C	I think there are they could be passed off as
C	pedigree you know some people like a I don't know I just really hope that
A	I hope they are resold and then
C	I hope she
A	death
C	what can you do about it?
A	ah
C	I did love
B	I don't love that ginger thing
C	oh that's horrible
B	mm
A	what ginger thing?
C	the ginger tom that keeps hanging around and he comes in
B	oh no I meant
C	oh no
C	no I don't either he's an ugly
A	he's very fat
C	very fat got like a lion's mane around his neck
B	yeah
A	yeah he'd probably be more attractive if he was thinner
C	we've got this ginger tom that keeps hanging around here
A	mm
C	he comes in spits and spats he'll disappear for weeks and weeks
B	and then he'll spat
C	and then he'll suddenly appear and he keeps trying to sneak well he does sneak in sometimes I know because he sprays cos sometimes you get up in the morning
A	er
C	and the house absolutely reeks and you can't it sort of it doesn't not in any one particular area it's just all over
A	oh god
C	we just have to wait for it to
A	that's horrible
C	mm
A	probably just cos it just goes round eating all the other cat's food
C	mm maybe
A	oh that's so annoying
C	and that's when you were in Germany and dad had to one night he put a table up and go kept ours in put a table up against the cat flap didn't you? so cos if you locked it he could break you know break
A	he'd break through?
C	mm
A	oh goodness me like like
C	er they're not very substantial though
A	like
C	yeah no he didn't break the cat flap he erm just sort of shoved it until the locks give way and
A	oh
C	they're very insubstantial
A	yeah
C	unsubstantial
A	not really sure actually
C	mm I don't think there is such a word
A	I think there is
C	mm anyway
B	in the morning the table was completely smashed
B	well that's what you asked for wasn't it?
C	mm I did
B	not like

C	don't go and see him and they insisted they said no no he'll remember us
A	oh my god
C	no idea what it was going to do and then it just went mental and jumped up and was hugging them and
A	ah that's really cute isn't it?

C	powdered extract four to one two hundred and fifty milligram whole root equivalent
A	okay
C	and four four to one ratio

B	what?
A	potato I wonder who wrote that one all about potatoes mm
B	oh did little
C	what did you have to write about potato? why did you have to write about potatoes?
A	because this is the herbizest website which is all about herbs and natural remedies and herbal living things
C	yeah
A	and we had to write encyclopaedic articles about herbs and their properties so I'd be given a vegetable or a fruit and have to write about it
C	oh
B	did you write this?
A	yes
B	did you write potatoes are native to South America? did you write those words?
A	yes
C	then why doesn't why is this phone not reacting when I press on the links?
A	maybe you can't press on links
B	show me and I'll
A	maybe your finger's too fat? maybe you need to make it bigger
C	oh
B	I dunno
C	I just tried another one where it says read more as well and it wouldn't react to that either
B	well that's
A	erm yeah did you know potatoes originally came from Peru?
C	erm no I thought they came from
A	from
C	oh was it Peru? I thought it was the Americas oh I suppose that was
A	yeah
C	okay but I was think I was thinking USA
A	American yeah
C	erm
A	yes they
C	well yeah I don't I'm saying after he brought the first potatoes back to England
A	oh okay
C	yeah
A	and they started being used all over Europe
C	yeah
A	and because they were a really cheap way of feeding workers and all of that erm and but the French wouldn't accept potatoes as part of their natural diet
C	the French never do do they
A	for about three hundred years or some
C	right
A	and so erm it was not seen as proper that an upper class would eat a potato because it's a root
C	right oh
A	erm and so it wasn't part of their diet and for a very very long time because of that reason
C	mm
A	cos it wasn't seen as a proper thing to eat but apparently there were about three thousand varieties of potato in Peru before the Spanish got there and now there's about one thousand
C	why?
A	of just I don't know they've just died off they've just I don't know I think I think because they used to grow wild they weren't cultivated before that people would just pick them wild and then when the Spanish came and everything they started being cultivated so there were only about there were only a few chosen as you know ones to grow and gradually the other varieties just died off
C	oh
A	so that's the story of potatoes
C	did you know
A	you didn't read my
C	that before they before carrots were cultivated and
A	yeah
C	they were they were purple
A	I did know that yeah
C	yeah but they're specialised now
A	yeah
C	but the normal natural
A	she
A	never mind
B	huh?
A	never mind
B	purple carrots
A	why do you can't you just say purple carrots?
C	just google under
A	purple carrots well it obviously did
B	purple carrots
A	yeah
B	Machu pictures
B	some Machu pictures that means the carrot came from there too
A	you're such an idiot
C	carrots used to be purple before the seventeenth century
C	today I found out what did I find out today?
A	yeah cos apparently the purple ones weren't very sweet at all
C	ah
A	they weren't they weren't as nice as the ones we had today
C	before this pretty much all carrots
B	er why does it keep doing that?
C	bollocks
B	what have you done?
C	I pressed on something that I shouldn't have
B	ah little
C	before this pretty much all carrots were purple with mutated versions occasionally popping up including yellow and white carrots these were rarely cultivated and lacked the purple pigment anthesian
A	what's that?
C	if you eat just loads and loads and loads of carrots your skin turns purple
A	mm I've heard that as well
C	carotene not purple
A	yeah orange
C	orange
