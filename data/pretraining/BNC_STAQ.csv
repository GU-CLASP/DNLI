A	didn't fully understand so all I know is that it's some way of your body keeping you healthy cos something about filling up the tissue with new blood and stuff
B	yeah
A	it helps it stay healthy and it stops you from getting erectile dysfunction
B	well they get like seven or eight
A	yeah it's something ridiculous like
B	it's it's not just in the morning
A	yeah it is
B	does that make
A	they've got more desire for yeah like oh sometimes when
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	well
A	yeah
B	like isn't my ex-boyfriend were huge like
A	I don't like that
B	ridiculously big
A	no
A	oh
B	like he thought it like cos he said he's obviously seen other boys' penises when they've been in showers and that and his just seemed small I comparison
A	oh but to be completely honest I'd rather have a guy with a slightly smaller than average penis than a slightly bigger because can you imagine? A it's painful
B	well
A	B it stretches you out
B	yeah
A	and you can't really do the same stuff like
B	well
A	get in places
B	yeah
A	that a bigger penis couldn't
B	yeah well the he isn't small
A	oh bless him
B	and then after that I just used to take piss out of him like ha ha small dick
B	and he he got over it straight away
A	ah
B	like
A	that's good
B	but I I think that is the way to deal with it like if you've got an insecurity about yourself take the piss out of it like that's why I take the piss out of my manly voice and like my big nose like when that fly landed on it like
A	that's what I do with my forehead
B	do you know what I mean?
A	making jokes about flying to China
B	yeah
A	I mean it's hurtful when other people do it
B	well if they did it viciously
A	but I do it myself it's like even when people do it as a joke I still find it helpful cos I'm like I'm the only person that can laugh about that you're not allowed to
B	I'm allowed cos I'm your best friend I've got a
A	mm
B	I don't have a receiving hairline either my hairline keeps getting
A	mine's going the other way
A	soon I'll be bald I'll just have a little ponytail like a Chinese person
A	mm
B	everyone people say to me oh you should do blah-blah and like yeah maybe I am but it's a personal thing and
A	mm
B	my way of dealing with it is taking the piss out of it
A	it's like people who you look at and you think are absolutely perfect they still have insecurities
B	mm
A	and just cos you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there
B	no
A	but she is
B	I would never tell her she has an amazing body either
A	she wouldn't even accept it
B	I know she wouldn't
A	I've tried several times I've just been like do you know how beautiful you are and she's literally just like shut up and she gets quite vicious about it
B	mm
A	mm
B	like I actually genuinely like her
A	she's calmed calmed down I think
B	yeah she's grown up a lot hasn't she? like matured so much cos obviously she had that job didn't she so
A	yeah so I think what with getting the job and sort of kind of moving out of her family home
B	yeah
A	I don't know like she's going to England
B	yeah
A	so we're not doing much because she could still
B	she could still come like
A	just shall I send her a message and see if she wants to come over and watch a film or something?
B	yeah definitely like I like but I like well not but
A	no she's
B	not that she was were a dickhead before but she were just annoying like cos she was just so immature but like she has really calmed down and I actually really like her
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but also I sort of put her off a bit by saying just wait until next year it'll be better cos I
B	yeah
A	so well now you understand why I didn't invite you or anyone sooner sort of thing
B	yeah
A	but plus it's gonna be amazing if someone does come over because the room's gonna be slightly bigger
B	yeah and there's always there's room on the floor for them to sleep room in the living room
A	exactly and it's just
B	room in my bedroom
A	it's gonna be so much nicer to be able to be in an environment where everyone's nice and friendly
B	mm
A	and
B	it's not hostile
A	mm
B	it's not a hostile environment
A	cos it was nice when
B	yeah
A	just got annoying
B	that's why I'm
A	do you want your last little cig?
B	no I've saved it for you
A	thank you
B	erm
A	mm
B	cos like
A	yeah
B	and it weren't like I were at home when I could go out shopping for day or go to see one of my friends
A	yeah
B	we were constantly together and like I loved every minute in New
A	America
B	but like it were just and then when we got back it were the same on top of each other and it were just it's just nice to get away
A	yeah
B	like
A	that's why this summer I've loved being with
B	yeah rugby
A	goes for rugby training and stuff
B	yeah
A	like having that little break is nice like the other day when I got pissed off with him he came back that night it was absolutely fine
B	yeah
A	cos I know that he just needed that little bit of space to cool off I needed that little bit of space to not keep being pissed off at him
B	yeah
A	and then it's fine
B	yeah cos er I mean
A	mm
B	like normal like little things you deal with pissing me off like one he were coming
A	but there are though there are little things that annoy you that it it happens to me and I get annoyed and I'm just like why am I angry?
B	yeah
A	there's no reason to be angry and it is just because you've just been around for too long I think
B	yeah
A	oh there's two lizards on the wall down by the pool house
B	oh yeah
A	on the on the crack in by the ceiling they're so cute I love them
B	they go so move so fast don't they?
A	mm
B	oh
A	and it ran away but well lizards like the
B	yeah they can yeah
A	so like I always knew about their tails but their legs as well
B	yeah they can grow anything yeah
A	they can regrow legs which is so cool
B	it must be so painful though
A	yeah but can you imagine like oh no I lost an arm okay give it a week I'll have another one
A	but I would really really really hate to lose a limb
B	oh yeah me too
A	in an accident or something I would fucking hate that
B	my worse fear is being paralysed or being or having dementia or something being stuck in my own body
A	trapped in your own body
B	I'm terrified of that
A	it's awful like that ALS challenge
B	yeah
A	for those people that was awful cos they lose the
B	they lose everything
A	can't seem to even talk
B	they lose everything like they're just trapped in their own body like if I ever got like that I would want someone to kill me
A	mm
B	I would want someone just to end it all because that is not a life that's an existence
A	I reckon if I was like paraplegic it would be hard but it would be liveable because you'd still be mobile in the top
B	yeah
A	and they say that sometimes when you're paraplegic you still have feeling down there so you can so could have like sex and stuff
B	yeah
A	which is nice
A	it's just so emasculating
A	yeah like I said earlier my worst nightmare is being
B	mm
A	people thinking I'm crazy when I'm not
B	mm
A	like being kept there against your will
B	yeah
A	I would fucking hate that or like if something genuinely did happen and no-one believed you and they just thought that you were crazy
B	yeah like in
A	yeah
B	like them books I'm reading now
A	like in erm the second series of American Horror Story
B	I ain't seen it yet
A	it's all about a mental asylum and there's things that happen when people go there but they're kept there against their will
B	yeah
A	that is awful
B	I need to watch that
A	it's so good
B	mm
A	I love the music in it
A	mm
B	just like a simple one that goes over the shoulders like a simple white dress that goes up to there
A	oh that's lovely
B	it were like fifty quid or something
A	that's great
B	like I don't know what to say to them like I don't like asking
A	don't it doesn't help
B	cos it doesn't help at all does it? but like I just wanna always ask that are you alright how are you coping? it's like they
A	don't
B	don't need to hear that
A	just be there for them make them laugh spend time with them that's all they want
B	well I'm going over tomorrow night mum's gonna pick me up from the train station
A	yeah
B	oh actually I'll take erm
A	alright thank you
B	erm
A	don't forget there's three pillows
B	cos I need to connect the router up because we've got Sky and we've got internet but we don't have a router so you can't use the Sky or the internet and I've got the Sky viewing card as well
A	yeah
B	cos basically what happened is it got delivered to that house a week before and whoever were living there before has either chucked it away or
A	yeah
B	took it with them which we've told Sky were gonna happen and I'm like don't deliver it to that house and they did anyway
A	yeah
B	like
A	that's nice
B	asked me to go and stay over so
A	can you imagine your legs look like that? how weird that is
B	it would be horrible wouldn't it? some girls do look like that though
A	yeah some like like people naturally have like bandy like mine are quite bandy when I stand up but at the knees
B	yeah
A	they go out a bit like that
B	I saw some weird in someone put this thing on Facebook er one of those things that I follow and it were basically different types of women's legs
A	mm
B	and it was so weird like how people's vagina's look and stuff and like that is just it just looked weird like I don't know anyone who's got a vagina like that cos one of them were like you said like with the thighs like that
A	mm
B	but then like you could see the whole of the
A	oh
B	thing it and it just looked awful but it were just a drawing it were a cartoon
A	yeah
B	it weren't actually a person
A	yeah
B	so I don't know what it would look like in real life
A	it's still gross
B	okay
A	I'm getting a bit sweaty
B	imagine how warm the pool is with that on top of it
A	I know
