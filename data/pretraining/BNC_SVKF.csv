A	um
B	yeah but I never  I never  agree that there's
A	well like
B	like this is what gets on my nerves d'you know when they say like These kids who can't find work and that and I just think like for all my brother like
A	yeah a lot  a lot  of the time
B	I'm not advocating him as a
A	he's he's certainly great at finding jobs isn't he?
B	he he's never been unemployed he's never like for any length of time like maybe two weeks
A	yeah
B	he'll just take anything he'll just do anything like he's not  he's not  too proud to just take a job being a cleaner being a working in a factory or anything like he'll just
A	yes well
B	well I remember  I remember  when he was like when he was sick
A	he wanted to yeah maybe wanted to
B	he was collecting glasses at Idols this horrible horrible place in Sunderland nightclub um when he was still at school
A	he's just a
B	when he was sixteen
A	yeah
B	then he was
A	yeah
A	so from
A	yeah yeah he's done you know loads of hours of work yeah
A	until two like
A	yeah
A	oh yeah um
B	there was like a bin man from here and then a bin man from like
A	yeah
B	where was it? Kenya Nairobi? And like
A	uh it was Indonesia
B	it was somewhere like that wasn't it? Really? Was it not
B	he like worked fifteen hour days
A	he's a very hard working guy isn't he?
B	similarly if you work four hours a day every day like then
A	mm that was a very hard job yeah
B	that's just what you get used to so
A	yeah well it's it's just loads of so
B	well we were both a bit like that like when I was  when I was  when I was still at home like
A	we were saying about the
B	I used to go to like for example on a Saturday I would go to music where I was teaching and stuff and have music lessons myself but
A	yeah
B	go from nine till twelve
A	yeah
B	I did that every Saturday
A	that's that's good for you know for for like um
B	for two years like
A	like uh in a bar whatever
B	I don't know
A	what d'you mean you didn't wanna do anything else?
B	like I didn't wanna just stay I suppose I dunno why I didn't wanna just stay at home on a Saturday
A	yeah
B	went to college all week
A	well cos you wanted to have the I mean you wanted to have your own money didn't you?
B	yeah
A	you wanted to have your own money didn't you?
B	yeah
A	you wanted to apply things in um and that's something that I should've done more myself should have done more work myself um
B	well
A	so
B	yeah I mean
A	Cos my cousin's um doing it who's uh how old is she like eighteen or something cos she's doing?
B	who? Uh
B	ah
B	what is she doing? A tiny bit
A	she was working I think in a shop or bar and and or it's like and um
B	well
A	aged about eighteen I think and uh
B	no it's she's she is
A	yeah so she's um
B	yeah
A	if you if you're making more money then you can save it as well so you can have can save up for uni and like I know I knew people who like went to you know like friends who went from America to um
B	yeah
A	uh to to London you know so they worked very hard with like loads of hours like two jobs
B	yeah
A	um
B	I was the opposite like
A	for for to collecting money for the for the
B	I remember like being really looking forward to like getting a interest free overdraft
A	yeah that's the so-called pink debt isn't it um but like that's like a lot of people have got overdrafts haven't they but uh
B	yeah
A	but uh
B	are you alright?
A	but a question of whether they're like  in the long run cos you may end up paying a lot lot lot of interest but uh
B	yeah
A	obviously the the banks must make a profit with them otherwise they wouldn't uh otherwise they wouldn't make it so easy
B	well I think so cos they you keep like I suppose they keep them as customers like
A	yeah I mean that sort of thing's becoming more popular recently
B	and then like you get a mortgage with them or you you know get an ISA or
A	yeah
B	they have
A	um
B	I can
A	no I think
B	I was gonna say I can smell your sandwich that sort of smokiness I I still don't understand what
A	hopefully hopefully there isn't something on fire uh
B	I hope I haven't
A	yeah
B	no no I meant like I could
A	it's funny I can smell smoke and it's getting hotter
B	no
B	you've left the window open in here
A	I only it's only open a crack it's not like
B	Don't open the window
A	it's only open a crack though innit?
B	yeah but it's like
B	nineteen degrees in there
A	oh right
B	you haven't I think you haven't haven't you haven't opened the bedroom window have you?
A	no no that's totally closed
B	very naughty
A	I just like to have a bit of fresh air coming in
B	well I know but like if it's cold
A	uh so now I think  I think  the overdraft the free overdraft
B	yeah
A	is good in some ways but in other ways um it it does cost in interest so
B	well
A	uh
B	yeah I mean
A	like
B	I remember  I remember  spending mine before I even went to uni
A	if if you used it properly yeah you could uh
B	I remember like buying stuff for uni out of my overdraft
A	oh right yeah
B	it's bad isn't it?
A	yeah so I had the overdraft and I had uh yeah and of course you have a student loan which everyone had and also the uh there's the fees which were introduced with like I mean
B	I think I've got like
A	so there is I mean and of course they're increasing that aren't they uh that's a big thing in the news isn't it that they they dramatically increased
B	I'll have to work out how much
A	I read that I had the little German uh article from Der Spiegel
B	yeah
A	um talking about student fees and um
B	yeah
A	like uh
B	sorry student thing
A	I did they did mention like that it was in you know in German from a German perspective but they didn't mention how Britain had got massively higher but it
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	it it's one thing but then to to allow unis to raise their price
B	yeah
A	even further like um like three thousand on top of that uh
B	well I think like me  like me  granda's point was like he was saying that like he couldn't go to uni because you had to pay
A	yeah
B	my granda gets so angry at it I mean he he was angry in itself like that even I had to pay I mean which I didn't have to pay actually but
A	yeah neither did I because of yeah because of my my family wasn't earning as much at the time
B	yeah
A	but a lot of that is uh is also secondary school education
B	well yeah that's true
A	which is which I think a lot of people are just going to school and just wasting the opportunity
B	yeah
A	or the schools aren't good enough and and that's so that's a problem
B	yeah
A	uh like the I I I just I would like to live in a country where where education was free basically
B	well
A	but but there are a lot of um
B	is it free anywhere?
A	um
B	in the world like? What about in like the Middle East like?
A	you mean totally free? Well it used to be free here didn't it like?
B	well
A	it was
B	well
A	it it was Blair who introduced the fees wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	it was free before that
B	yeah that's true
A	so if you think about it even even Thatcher didn't do that
B	no
A	uh so yeah they
B	I can't believe she's still alive like
A	hate keeps a person alive
B	well I know
B	how old is she now?
A	uh
B	ah
A	irrelevant film facts
B	uh we watched that on a Sunday once I remember
A	it's a Sunday film and it might just send you into a post stuffing coma
B	it might do
A	uh
B	D'you wanna a cup of tea or anything?
A	I was gonna say  I was gonna say  something about fees wasn't I yeah and I but I haven't seen like a full-on comparison of fees across the world but I I'm pretty sure that within Europe places like
B	what about in Paris?
A	you're gonna probably find that in Scandinavia it's free
B	D'you think so?
A	you're probably gonna find that it's better in many of the European countries
B	is it true that that in like?
A	I'm fairly sure that it's better in German than it is in in England
B	is it true that in France like that you have to go to your
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	you have to pay quite a lot more I think which is seems to be a bit bit annoying but
B	yeah
A	uh
B	well
A	it costs
B	apparently
A	it costs you more as a foreign student in certain places
B	now like fifty percent of postgrads in the UK are foreign fifty percent I mean
A	well I think that's good I think it's it's an
B	no I don't think it's
A	they're bringing in money to the country
B	yeah
A	uh no I'm alright with this uh armchair I like this chair
B	sure? You're like me granda that was me grandad's armchair
B	the same
A	he's uh
B	I wonder how he's doing
A	grandad's and armchairs you know Winning combination isn't it?
B	yeah
A	did you use to like The Royle Family the the programme?
B	I never really watched it I never really got into it
A	oh yeah? It's it was  it was  likable really the family was very likable
B	yeah I
A	all all the characters were kinda likable like the
B	yeah
A	what's her name is it Sarah Lancaster or something?
B	no
A	right
B	yeah
A	he was from Brookside the man was from Brookside
B	she reminds me a bit of the the
A	the man was
B	the mam
A	he's he's Liverpudlian I think pretty sure he was from
B	the mum
A	pretty sure that the male guy was from Brookside wasn't he?
B	um
A	Cos he was from Liverpool
B	Don't know
A	yeah pretty sure he was in Brookside
B	maybe
A	yeah so he was like all but you know he was just like a total sort of like father who's a slob and he's just  he's just  permanently in his  in his  armchair like
B	the mam was
A	getting his  getting his  boy to bring him tea and everything
B	yeah
A	he just sat he really sort of owned the  owned the  room like he was like the boss
B	yeah
A	the uh
B	like my granda
A	well he he sort of dominated the conversation didn't he?
B	no
A	I don't know I think people might say that the boss of that family is uh
B	my nana
A	it's
B	she's the driving force
A	and
B	she doesn't half like an anecdote
B	ah I should've
A	I think you if you shouldn't maybe in some ways it's better to get paid by the word I suppose because then
B	well
A	but then of course you'd have to wait until like
B	but she doesn't talk particularly fast I don't think
A	ah it seems like
B	it's more like it's just a no no no it's just a very feels like a very long time cos her stories are so inane
A	seems like a lot of words coming out
B	it's like And then I was in Morrisons and I said
A	ah starting to feel sleepy
B	I know yeah
A	um no that's fine yeah
B	it's just a brief reenactment there
A	no no couldn't ah we we've got good patiences I mean we we've been talking about like like plants and uh things that are really like not not exciting
B	I literally should've just took it round my nana's and been like hi Nana and then just sat back
A	just
B	she
A	well we we can do that with uh we can do that when we  when we  go to Sunderland
B	yeah September
A	like you can just take it and take it everywhere and like stick it
B	I should've gone round my nana's and been like Nana have you ever been to America?
B	she loves Steven Segal
A	that would be something worth talking about
B	I could be like Nana what films have you been watching? And she'd be like
A	she likes Steven Segal probably like
B	I can imagine she's be like I've seen that Avatar
A	I liked Avatar so I don't
B	no but I I just like the idea that my nana watches
A	he's I don't know Howard Keel
B	oh you do
A	um
B	so in Calamity Jane there's like Wild Bill and then there's like the captain and he's like so Bill he's like a bigger like he he's got a bit of a sort of a shape like you like a
A	I don't cos I I just don't
B	what d'you mean?
A	you know it's it's anachronistic
A	no I'm just saying you know it's a bit like it's it's based on something but it's very liberal with like uh the facts
B	ah but isn't
A	uh yeah
B	well you should see Seven Brides For Seven Brothers
A	that's not that doesn't that wouldn't mean that it's a bad film
B	have you seen Seven Brides For Seven Brothers?
A	no
B	that's a great one
A	yeah I should maybe should investigate some more musicals
B	Seven Brides For Seven Brothers I watched that the other morning that's a Sunday one
A	I don't think it would my like my favourite film of all time
B	and he lives up in the mountains right and he comes down to the  he comes down to the  town like
A	oh yeah he seemed to like mountains in this one
B	it's like a Wild West sort of town and he comes down and he's
A	Brokeback Mountain
B	he's singing about how he wants to find a wife and
A	oh so not Brokeback Mountain then
B	he looks at all the other women's in the
A	would've been funny if Brokeback Mountain was a musical
B	and then he  and then he  sees through the window this woman and she's like she was running the like cook house like the you know the café if you like and um all these men are giving her grief and she's like batting it back at them and she's got real feistiness
A	no I don't it's it's alright I'm just
A	no no it's alright I mean
B	so
B	alright then
A	this is uh
B	takes her home
A	yeah
B	then he then she realizes that like she's been really romanticising the idea then going to live in the mountains la-di-la
B	like
A	Dabraham Eabraham Fabraham
B	no
A	yeah
B	he's got all these brothers and then they've like got really bad manners they're like a
A	yeah?
B	and cause an avalanche on the way
A	I think
B	so they're stuck there for the whole summer
A	this is
B	what?
A	sounds like a pretty exciting musical
B	oh you're trying to
A	no I'm just like
B	when I'm like in forty years time I'll be Nana Dembry and then I'll just be telling you stories
A	I know yeah
B	well that's my nana introduced us to that film anyway
A	no no I mean
B	alright so boys kidnap the the girls from the village so they can't be rescued so then the original  the original  woman in it the main woman get really angry at the original the main guy in it cos he
A	that's not very nice
B	so he goes off to the mountains
A	yeah you would wouldn't you?
B	but then after a while they warm to them and realise actually that they do love them
A	oh
A	no no no no I'm fine uh no it sounds like a
B	aw
A	it's a no it sounds  it sounds  good um
B	no it doesn't
A	oh no I like um I like  I like I like  West Side Story so
B	I've got I've gotta work on my storytelling
A	no I like the idea of musicals though I think I'd I'd like to see more like
B	some good ones
A	there's there's a great uh there's a great um comedy musical uh made by the director of Lord Of The Rings Peter Jackson
B	yeah? What's it called?
A	it's called Meet The Feebles
B	oh I've seen it and I'm not a massive fan but yeah
A	it's probably more of boys'
B	mm I think so
A	it's a bit disgusting but
B	but you know  you know  Tim Minchin?
A	I do actually yeah
B	he's just wrote the
B	um
A	I don't know what that is
B	um
A	he's written a
B	he's written the songs and music to
A	book
B	he's written the songs and the music to uh Matilda so there's Matilda The Opera's on at the moment
A	oh yeah
B	I really fancy seeing that
A	it's similar to Carrie by Stephen King
B	um
A	and it came out at a similar time and I'm not sure which was first actually
B	I don't think it's that similar to Carrie
A	well that's your own fault isn't it?
B	and Night Of The Living Dead have you ever seen that?
A	that must've  that must've  been a
B	have you ever seen Night Of The Living Dead?
A	I love that
B	oh I saw that when I was about twelve
A	it's George A Romero
B	no I must've been older thirteen
A	no I showed you um
B	God it was horrible
A	is that? D'you mean the?
B	one with the pins in his face?
A	that's not Night Of The Living Dead
B	what's that then?
A	uh Hellraiser's the one where he's got pins in his head
B	oh Hellraiser then
A	I haven't seen that
B	oh I hated it
A	for some reason like like sort of ten year-olds really like eighteen rated films
B	I had this friend called Nicki who lived just like
A	oh hear we go
B	alright that's the end of that story
B	what I can't say about I can't say
A	no no I was only joking because like you know like
B	I just said the estate that I live in alright the place that I lived in like
A	yeah no I was it was a joke it was just a joke uh
B	well it wasn't very funny
A	sort of backfired
A	like uh whatever the original meaning of that comes from
B	is it not a car?
A	I don't know
A	where you've lit it in like a cartoon and like uh
A	and like and it the the you know you know the the the the um
B	we were talking about that the other day cos I was saying about like how they end up with this hole in their face
A	the the fuse goes down you know the the you light the fuse down
B	yeah
A	the fuse goes down
B	then nothing happens
A	then
B	then you pop pop your head round the end
A	there's like a pause
B	I was talking about it the other day
A	something's wrong with my canon
B	Cos we were talking about Tom And Jerry
A	yeah yeah
B	should watch some Tom And Jerry
A	yeah maybe
B	although we haven't got broadband so might need to do that first
A	night Of The
B	is that the one that like um?
A	and it has uh the hero is like a  like a  black guy but he he actually gets shot uh at the end of it it's quite poignant actually
B	have I seen it?
A	um because the police assume that he's a a zombie and they kill him even though he was like the hero
B	oh right
A	it's like sad ending that
B	no I don't mean that
A	night Of The Living Dead has a famous start doesn't it cos it's like it's in a graveyard or something or a park
B	I don't know
A	and then the the woman runs runs to this house and then that's why she she they're sort of holed up in in the house and the zombies are coming at them
B	I don't think I've
A	you know that's a sort of like a common
B	but what I was gonna tell you before was that I went to this sleepover once like with this girl called Nicki and what I was trying to say was in the place that I lived like it could um
A	yeah yeah no no fair enough it is it was a council estate
B	it was like um so like the streets were arranged in like courts like in squares but like so like some of the bits out the back like you had a bit where you could run or like you could get all the way down where you could walk in a long line for a long way like past houses on either side and there was kind of ones like that
A	yeah
B	it was kind of in like a
A	yeah
B	the school was in the middle and there was like sort of the
A	yeah
B	anyway and I went to this sleepover once and we were watching these horror films and that and and like in the end I just like I ran home and I was still in my pyjamas and I ran it was like it must've been about like
A	sorry isn't isn't the point of a sleepover to like
B	I got too scared
A	hellraiser
B	and I was like I'm just going to the toilet and I just was like
A	really?
B	I just ran all the way up like up the street like up the thing all the way home and I was like mam
A	yeah thought that you'd been abducted by like the guy with pins coming out of his head
B	so my mam made us go back
A	that's just strange strange behaviour
B	no she came back with us and then we went we came back home
A	fair enough but like running out cos you don't wanna go out  you don't wanna go out  that's the worst  that's the worst  thing you do you know you're getting all the clichés and that
B	but running in the middle of the night I know yeah
A	there's a lot  there's lot  of horror clichés and that's why they made uh they made Scream you know to sort of as like a  like a  sort of self-referential
B	just like a child running around
A	like postmodern
B	Tom likes all them things I'm not really
A	D'you like Scream? Have you seen it?
B	never really seen it
A	it's quite
B	with the mask
A	that's where she met her husband
B	he's not her husband any more
A	ah
B	well
A	oh right
B	no I
A	uh um
B	uh yeah
A	are you gonna pause it then?
