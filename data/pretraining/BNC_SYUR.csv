A	yum
B	oh actually I was gonna look at the map while we're here cos I wanted to see where
B	yeah that's what I was thinking was that before or after where we're going?
A	we're doing quite good for time today
B	yeah if I was like
A	would you? what cos you've done it?
B	cos she's carrying all the stuff on her back
A	really?
B	everything she's read she burns at night
A	really?
B	cos it's less weight and I was thinking I could pull out the pages of her book that I haven't read
A	I love setting fire to things
B	I mean that I have read not that I haven't read
B	where is it?
A	there's
B	oh yeah
B	you think that's where we are? so
A	oh no we're in
B	oh are we? already?
A	yeah
B	okay so
A	is it?
B	we're going up to
B	so mm there's
A	oh we go past
B	where were we here?
A	yeah
B	and now we're sort of here
A	mm
B	okay so maybe we're like a third of the way
A	mm
B	excellent
A	there was no real erm
B	there's always something
A	thought we were going in remote coastal wilderness
B	I did as well
A	where there weren't any stops and there weren't any
B	I think we probably have to be in doing that other trip to get that you know the Texas type one
A	yeah
B	even if I really can't be bothered when we get there I'm definitely gonna try and make myself have a walk
A	yeah
B	cos sometimes we get there and I erm
B	awesome thanks so much for spotting that
A	that's alright
B	eagle eye
A	shall I invoice you every time I see one?
B	might as well just use another bank
A	oh just the reason I
B	yeah
A	very eloquently for an hour on something easily anyway one particular one there were loads one particular one was erm
B	yeah this happens a lot
A	well this is it and
B	oh interesting
A	is she a hypocrite? so one girl said an unequivocal yes
B	yeah
A	because
B	she didn't have kids when she had that opinion
A	no
B	no
A	cos that just shows you can't think outside your own
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah I know what you mean
A	you know what I mean can't think
B	outside your yeah
A	if she had said
B	yeah
A	of a of the same level that they should be
B	but given that they're not I'll still send mine
A	yeah because I wouldn't I would want my children to have the best education
B	if I can afford it mm
A	and I but I
B	no one should do it
A	no one should do it and then she did it so you can't that's that is hypocrisy
B	yeah
A	erm
B	what I think is that how is it any different to how people with more money can get more things in all their areas of life? people who earn more get more stuff including I can afford private school I can afford a big car I can afford a big house
B	I can afford a better holiday than you my kids can go to a better school I just don't see how it's any different
A	well
B	cos otherwise you're gonna have to be a communist
A	yeah this is this is kind of erm
B	mm
A	in life so
B	mm
A	and if everyone had a good education then you're starting from a fair point in society and then it's kind of up to you
B	mm
A	to work harder
B	make make
A	make the most of it yeah whereas if you just say well erm
B	mm
A	but an education is a little bit more important than that and so's being able to have the drugs or the operation or whatever is
B	mm
A	would of course be erm in favour of that
B	I mean we are lucky in our country cos we have the NHS which I
A	yeah
B	national health system
A	I know
B	and that obviously everyone's always complaining about it but it's actually free
A	yeah
B	where we are now in America they don't have it
A	no
A	I dunno what they I don't really understand it cos
B	no
A	sometime you can you can call an ambulance and people will turn up
B	yeah but I you know on my er programmes which are all based on real life
A	yeah
B	so like on Grey's Anatomy which is obviously a really intelligent thing to bring up
B	I do wish that I could have these conversations like going yeah but on The Good Wife
B	but it's true on Grey's Anatomy this guy came in needed emergency treatment had no insurance and they weren't able to do it so he died
A	oh
B	although there was one time when one of the surgeons just like
A	yeah
B	did it anyway but then he got into trouble erm
A	yeah
B	who was gonna pay for it? cos it was like twenty thousand pound surgery and all this stuff so
A	yeah
B	and it was a bit like seriously they're not gonna save your life
A	yeah
B	cos you haven't got insurance
A	yeah well that's the extreme of it isn't it? that's where you're going if you're not careful with private healthcare and private schooling and all that sort of thing if you're not careful with it it ends up it will end up being like that that's what the whole problem is with the NHS at the moment is that they're trying to sell off bits of it and I saw a documentary on it and I can't remember a bloody thing
A	about it but it was the impression I was left with after watching it is that you can't believe that's what they're allowed to get away with and it was all about how erm
B	mm
A	I don't think it helps people
B	no I don't
A	because it it actually just apart from that's unfair as well
B	yeah
A	at the same time it doesn't help those people if you are naturally a little bit inclined to sit on your arse
B	oh yeah you can totally afford to
A	and then someone says here you go you don't have to work you're not going to and then
B	the worst is when
A	but
B	I think the benefits should be less in that case
A	course it should
B	for goodness sake
A	that's the thing but that's when there's something wrong with the system and the other theory is that they're trying to do a population poll cos there are too many people
B	mm
A	so which I can actually believe we
A	well we're not so sure we don't devise these social policies but yet I can see that
B	god
A	those children then have children they're all into drugs and gangs and
A	all getting like stabbed and and
B	the scrotes breeding scrotes
B	yeah
A	if you've got unemployment then there's ill health and then then there's drugs and alcoholism and all that sort of thing that goes with it and then there's gangs and it's just a means of killing people off
B	yeah
A	and it's almost as if that's been facilitated by this because you cannot
B	yeah
A	but then it's all part of the theory of everything so it doesn't
B	mm
A	in the in the great scheme of things everything's all unfolding as it's going to anyway there's not that much of a difference do you see what I mean?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	in order for everybody to have the same healthcare what has got to happen has the government got to make the NHS better so that nobody needs private healthcare
A	yeah
B	erm if they can afford it they can oh my goodness
A	oh wow
B	if they can afford it they might decide to pay for it because they might survive then or no I don't know
A	yeah
B	erm so in order for this to stop needing to happen the government has to improve the NHS right? or
A	I have now decided that's gonna be one of the first things I thoroughly read erm
B	it's in the top
A	it is
B	reading about stuff or knowing stuff cos I feel like I don't know anything
A	it's murder well there's always more to know
B	where should we start?
A	private health care
B	no but I mean
A	yeah
B	so and then so one thing is the newspaper but you get wrapped up in news but they do
B	it is informative as well
A	mm
B	but how else could you do it? maybe you do a bit of news how how else I mean do you have to read like factual books basically? cos this might be a struggle for me
A	erm
A	yeah
B	have you seen Ted talks? I've only seen one
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah they're good
B	so I'm not letting you say anything I'm asking you and then carrying on talking
B	so so how can we do it? how can we become?
A	you do just have to read and read and read I one this lecturer that I had was really good he said about there's nothing worse than having an opinion if you don't know he said we all do it he said but there's nothing worse than having to listen to people that know a little bit about a massive subject and don't know the whole thing
B	yeah so they rant on and on and then
A	he said there's nothing else for it you just have to read and read and read and read and read and it's true
B	cos it is embarrassing like if we were in the car with someone who actually knew loads of stuff sorry I don't mean that I don't mean that you
A	that's usually me yeah that's usually me with
B	and then
B	you'll be there going I think nana na na na na na and they'll go erm but didn't you know that blah blah blah? and you'll and then you feel like a complete idiot
A	yes and no right because it's a massive subject even just this right because here's the thing say
B	mm
A	no
B	you know in
A	this is the sort of thing that I said would happen
B	in the middle of the night it was like but that's a whole topic
A	oh yeah we can't
B	now everything we've calmed down and forgotten what they all are
A	no this is but I knew this would happen cos we'd been talking about stuff in general and then something would come up that would remind me
B	yeah
A	erm
B	is that a ladybird?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and he said why should I push in front of somebody who erm
B	you're done
A	you're done and this private one is it's been done privately so it's off the the general list
B	I wonder how it works if in the
A	but someone said
B	the private guy's gonna be busy no matter whether it's your grandad or some or someone else or is it that the private guy also doesn't the NHS stuff and therefore if your grandad isn't on the private no but then your grandad's still on the other list
A	what I was gonna say
B	but we don't know how it works do we?
A	I've forgotten now
B	yeah
A	yeah no so someone said
B	yeah
A	but then somebody else said would say do you think there's a load of surgeons sitting round like twiddling their thumbs just waiting
B	no
A	for someone? like they're all taken up all the time and it's just really pushing I don't see this is why I don't know cos I've gotta find out
B	yeah we need to find this out
A	ye
B	also cos I've I sort of understood that maybe it's like I'm not sure this is always the case but I know that it's sometimes the case
A	yeah yeah
B	but it but it's when you have it so you'll still be getting I don't this is probably not always the
B	erm it's probably not always the case but I did understand sometimes that it could be the same guy so he has to divide his week between er the private and the NHS
A	yeah the private
B	on the other hand I think it could also be the case in some scenarios that if you're private
A	yeah
B	erm and then you might have to wait again er
A	mm
B	even when you're private maybe you still just have whoever's going because er
A	mm
B	so we all have erm health coverage because we're not German so we can't have the German health thing
A	yeah
B	so we have basically private
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	so I had to have this mole removed
A	mm
B	and erm I've had I'd been to all I'd been to a few different dermatologists about I can't remember what about though yeah mainly about moles
A	mm
B	so and they would just go so one dermatologist went
A	mm
B	and then at one time it was really it was really great on the NHS they did photos of my moles because one of the main things about melanomas is when your mole changes
A	mm mm
B	and if you can't really remember
A	mm
B	well especially on your back
A	mm
B	so took all these photos horrendous
B	I'd been out the night before and got drunk and I'd got spots as well and I tried to cover them up with a bit of foundation
B	and this woman's got the most clearest camera ever in the world obviously
A	oh how upsetting
B	so not only did she get the moles in in the most amazing way she also got like the pores
B	and the the bit of foundation there and like the spot there
A	ah
B	and then my toes looked like looked like an ogre and
A	ah
B	but anyway and that was back when I was gorgeous
A	mm
B	so anyway get to Germany comes to my yearly check-up time so I think right I'll
A	right
B	and in fact it annoys me now cos in England they used to go given where it is we'll we'll keep going with it we'll try and not remove it whereas I actually thought later I don't give a shit what it looks like because it's here
A	yeah
B	I don't know if you can see it the scar
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah there's hardly anything
A	right
B	cos it was there they were like mm most people wouldn't wanna have it removed because in case there's a scar and then maybe you get married and like there's a scar and and I just sort of went along with it but I actually think if there's any doubt that that might be a melanoma just get rid of it I don't care about a
A	yeah
B	okay it might be different if it was on my face I dunno so anyway
A	mm
B	everyone was like this one we'll really
A	right
B	but we're also having this one off this random one on my leg so I knew
A	yeah
B	already I knew something was up now there's a problem with this private insurance that we had at work which is that if because you're privately covered they do more things than what you need and it's terrible terrible terrible so they'll be like oh you've got a cough? we'd better take some blood and do some tests
B	and then it costs like three hundred and fifty euros which your private insurance pays for
A	has paid for
B	erm and at first you don't realise cos you're new and you kind of like go oh we need to do a blood test bloody hell
A	yeah
B	erm then the third time you're like you need to take more blood?
B	no you don't so I started saying
A	rip off
B	I've already had blood taken two months ago so I'll get you the results of that then I would just forget erm so the point being I've got to try and like hurry up the point being that so I I knew something was odd about that mole because the one on my leg did not it was like a totally normal mole
A	right
B	so I went to a second dermatologist
A	yeah
B	to get a second opinion
A	yeah
B	and he screwed me over as well
B	but I was stupid cos I went in going I need a second opinion cos I'm pretty sure I'm being screwed over but I shouldn't have done that I'm so stupid
A	why?
B	I should have gone in just
A	yeah
B	oh really? who's screwing you over?
B	and he's desperate for me to tell him the name and being a I'm really disappointed with myself because I didn't hadn't done done my assertiveness course so I didn't know to pause and think
A	yeah
B	I just said the name and I didn't wanna tell him the name
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	cos this guy was clearly an arsehole and he was rubbing his hands with glee
B	going erm and was his English not very good?
B	you know and all this stuff so anyway this guy when I got my bill
A	yeah
B	erm so he I can't remember what he'd said now about the moles because it all got overtaken by the fact that he sent me a bill and on it was this thing saying took cultures and sent to lab well he didn't
A	mm
B	he never took any cultures so I called up going what cultures? you didn't do any cultures and and he was really awkward on the phone so anyway
A	oh
B	I was like right now I'm totally screwed so do you know what I did? I remembered that the dermatologist that I'd seen in England
A	yeah
B	was German
A	yeah
B	so I actually called him my mum was a bit like oh don't bother him but I called him and I said listen Dr
B	I'm in Germany now
A	yeah
B	what would you do? and he said well at first he was a bit like
A	ah
B	am I in the am I in the am I in the right bit of the road?
A	oh
B	get onto that lane as soon as I can
A	yeah yeah yeah you were actually but
A	it's a bit tricky that weren't it?
B	so he was a bit like stressed out but then he said look I don't know any dermatologists in Frankfurt but there's one thing I do know is that if I was in Germany I would go to the university hospital
A	yes
B	so I was like oh Dr
A	mm mm mm mm
B	went to the proper hospital and they did indeed remove that mole erm
A	can I just tell you?
B	yeah but you see I never had I never thought that before I went to Germany
A	mm
B	it was like as if
A	yeah that that's probably cos you there's this huge private erm
B	but do you know what the key thing is? you don't have to be referred
A	you can just go?
B	you can just bugger off to any specialist you want whereas in England it's really good you have to be referred even if you want to go private
A	mm
B	so you can't just be having loads of things do
A	turn up
B	and I just believe I really believe this and it's not just because I'm biased against Germany
A	mm
B	I really believe from my experience
A	mm
B	cos I have done had some private things done in England cos I've had several jobs with private stuff
A	mm
B	I really believe they don't do it if it doesn't need doing whereas in Germany
A	mm they
B	I've talked to a lot of people and we and we came to the consensus that
A	yeah
B	erm they they will do it unnecessarily and I find that to be so horrendous
A	mm
B	and and I genuinely don't think it happens in England now of course it might happen sometimes but I think we've got a really good system cos you have to be referred so you
A	mm
B	know how well I
B	no yeah but honestly I think there's something wrong with me you can't you can't get rid
A	yeah
B	and even if you go private you can't
A	yeah
B	you have to have a referral so you can't just wave your money around
A	yeah
B	and go I want to see a cardiologist your GP has to decide it's necessary and I think this is a really important safety net because you know someone like me
A	mm
B	there I am at the doctor and they're going
A	mm mm
B	I reckon I should do loads of blood tests well I'm gonna get nervous cos I'm thinking maybe it is necessary or is it? you know how you should be able to trust them
A	mm
B	and I think it's really outrageous but anyway so I ended up at the university hospital it felt much more like NHS type place
A	yeah
B	where they're really busy and they wouldn't be doing it if it didn't need doing
A	yeah
B	so I was so grateful that I found that
A	yeah
B	and actually over the last five years I've had three moles removed there
A	oh
B	erm and they are a bit more preventative I think cos but they were the three major moles that in England they were always like gonna have to keep keep keeping an eye on that one in Germany they're a bit more like we need to get rid of this cos one day it's gonna turn erm
A	well I think why not why not just get rid though in in the first place?
B	yeah I got rid of them and now I'm I feel better because they were my major ones
A	yeah
B	I've still got a few other big ones I've got so many little ones that
A	yeah
B	but the the whole point was erm
A	but that that's what I think is half the problem when there's money involved with things
B	yes
B	but I I genuinely do think that maybe we could find out for sure
A	yeah
B	I genuinely do think in England
A	having
B	we've got a safeguard in place
A	having spouted about it now for half an hour I realise that I really do have to go and read about this properly cos I don't know anything about it all I know is the NHS is a god is a is a fantastic thing
B	yeah
A	and we should keep it and it's this thing called TPP or TTP that's trying to corrupt it basically there's a whole documentary on it that's really good
B	yes
A	good
B	I'm I'm surprised I haven't shown you the latest scar
A	mm
B	cos I actually find it a really big thing having them off cos it's not a major operation but it's still I find it terrifying but anyway don't let me go on about that cos that'll just be me again
A	best to have it done though I think always best to have it done
B	yeah well if there's I I think I would with the mole
A	mm
B	I would rather do the preventative thing and if I'd said in England ages ago I don't care about the
A	quality?
A	I don't care
B	I actually don't care that much about you know
A	isn't it funny what some people say with things like that
B	mm
B	apart from the money thing I went about my knee
A	mm
B	cos I went skiing and my knee was playing my knee's have been existing problem for years and years and years
A	mm
B	and it had really really swollen up and like gone rigid it's cos I hadn't
A	mm
B	it's cos I hadn't erm sorry it's cos I hadn't exercised before I went went to the knee guy in Germany and he was like let's operate
A	mm
B	er
A	no
B	hang on a minute and then I just waited till I was next in England and I went to my old knee guy who
A	mm
B	saw it when I first did the injury when I was sixteen
A	mm
B	and he was like I wouldn't operate
A	yeah
B	this is causing me a problem
A	mm
B	and he said otherwise if I operate on it now I could make it worse and it's much better for you to just carry on making it worse
A	mm mm mm
B	and I was just like
A	mm
B	what if I'd just gone oh okay operate on it didn't need doing okay now I'm shutting up you carry on about your thing
A	no I see the point I I do see the point the of it all and it's a bit like religion in that respect because
B	yeah
A	whatever it is do it but then there's other people who think why would I wanna have an operation if I don't need an operation?
B	exactly yeah
A	and not only that but the two doctors may genuinely think you don't know it sounds a bit like they're they're up to no good in Germany but
B	yeah
A	two two different people might honestly think
B	exactly yeah yeah
A	that thing and they're doing what they think is the best thing as long as they're doing what they think is the best thing it's fine
B	yeah and it's the doubt over that that's the worry
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and when you introduce a quick buck to be made that's when you don't really know like what what's going on
B	anyway now tell me the thing
A	well what I was gonna say cos we we were talking about how much we don't know about anything and
A	which was them but that doesn't mean that she'd be cos there might be right I'll tell you this story then it might be clearer
B	that's interesting yeah
A	then it might be clearer so in one of my jobs erm was in wherever it was and at lunchtime I found that there was a a court nearby and I love courts and going and listening in the erm
B	oh yeah you told me
A	did I tell you?
B	you kept going in and listening
A	oh it's probably something I mentioned to you ages ago cos I wanted to tell you
B	are you allowed to eat your sandwich?
A	no no no
B	no
B	yeah I was just thinking
A	it's not urgent for me
B	we might be in an area where we could actually go to the loo
A	state parks at night
B	I was also thinking about you know bags
A	oh yeah if you see any
B	if we were at home we'd know just where to go and get a little holdall wouldn't we?
A	yeah
B	in a worrying way?
A	well just like
B	is it? is it? can you do? yeah yeah
A	yeah anyone can go in that's the whole point
B	yeah cos sometimes the judge shuts it off when it's really
A	yeah
B	everyone's shouting and yelling
A	yeah well you've got the jury
B	getting
A	and then it's where the family wanna sit if they wanna sit in on it or where journalists wanna sit if they wanna sit in it or public gallery anyone's allowed in so in I went and this man was going
B	and was he in the public gallery as well?
A	no it turns out he was the translator
A	so and he was going
B	you see I get enraged when people do that and I get like do you mind?
A	well I I thought to myself as much as I'd like to think it's cos I'm looking really stunning
A	it was more and I just thought you know not to do that I thought even if I was looking really stunning you
B	he shouldn't be looking at you like that because it's
A	well especially in a court right because there there are basically there was him me another person and another person and
B	yeah
A	erm
B	you wouldn't
A	in an office or
B	no
A	anywhere professional where you have to act professional you wouldn't do that
B	presumably not in a court either
A	well you'd think so I I was thinking to myself and in the end I just didn't like look I was just not looking but every time I looked back
B	if I turn left it's because I'm gonna take us to a toilet so just
A	oh okay
B	yep
A	there's a casino
A	right
A	well normally I don't
B	really intrusive
B	yeah
A	do you see what I mean?
B	do you?
A	yeah to use their loo just
B	oh I never thought of that ah
A	don't worry now go to the next one there'll be more
B	I was gonna it was there was erm
A	it's not
B	it's not very good where I was taking us either in comparison I was gonna it said KFC left and I thought that's the kind of place where you can sneak in a new
A	if you go in and say excuse me
B	excuse me but is it possible to use your toilet?
B	then they
A	oh there's one
B	a Best
A	hotel
B	hotel where?
A	oh it's a bank sorry it's a bank
B	right okay
A	looks
B	probably not in the bank they're gonna let us but now having seen this KFC sign again
A	it's up to you
B	let's see if there's somewhere to turn round
A	oh we're coming to
B	that KFC thing was one of those where there's a sign it tells you that it's coming up and then it doesn't tell you when it's actually there
A	we're still on the one 0 one excellent
B	cos actually do you know what we could do?
A	what?
B	like kept going for like ten minutes there might be a diner where we could have a cup of tea or something
A	a coffee
B	I mean do you fancy one?
A	sure thing
B	oops
B	yeah
B	okay anyway so
A	right
B	he was looking at you and you're like ignoring him
A	so you get the gist
B	yeah
A	know not to do that and he just
B	yeah
A	is there anybody in?
B	motel
A	oh I love these cherry blossom trees I love them I
B	ah
A	oh really?
B	but I could be making it up could be making it up so
A	we're going over a bridge
B	oh no is this that bridge?
A	is it? what bridge?
B	oh god okay let's stay calm there was a bridge I saw on a photo and I was hoping we weren't going on it
A	oh look
B	it's a really
B	it might not be the one I saw
A	oh
B	actually when you're on it you can't tell
A	it ain't that high up though
B	but we need to check later to find
A	if it's that bridge
B	a picture of the
A	oh look
B	exciting
A	look
B	is it too much of a pain for you to carry on telling me because now we're on high alert?
A	oh what for? erm sorry no I will cut to the chase of this of this erm story
A	and it's
B	oh no oh no
A	and the solicitor
B	yeah don't look
A	from this fact
B	yeah
A	so there's no question of him not understanding properly and the solicitor was so good and it made me think about how if you are a solicitor you have to be
B	yeah
A	you can't start calling names
B	you just have to be clever
A	you have to be very very clever keep your cool at the same time maintaining a tone that lets you
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and it made me think
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	for it and plus it it was that by the sound of it totally was so that's what they were trying to get him done for
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	the translator at one point he said take it alright assaulted her I sexually assaulted her take it take it in other words he was like I'm fed up with the questioning yeah I did it alright he he was he was so and he had this look on him of like
B	bloke the bloke
A	the the one who'd been charged
B	yeah
A	yeah he had this look on him that was like you know when you've you've been
B	you just yeah
A	it was like that now I thought if someone had charged me with doing something that I haven't done I would be looking the whole time at the he wouldn't he didn't really wanna look at the the solicitor he wouldn't look at him erm and he was just very
B	and you would be you would be like
A	no this happened no that happened
B	yeah
A	no and I know that cos I've been in court plenty of times
B	yeah
A	so you can't use that as a as in
B	yeah
A	I dunno I dunno
B	yeah
A	because I just thought his whole demeanour is is guilty
B	yeah
A	and isn't that a bit like
A	people if you can't look at someone
B	yeah
A	show that it it happens for a reason it it's based on
A	but so the bottom line of it was
B	yeah
A	and then you you
B	ah
A	and the story was so poor like his and it there was no chance of it being misinterpreted because he had the translator there was no chance of
B	yeah
A	maybe it's lost in translation
B	yeah
A	cos he had this this translator who was there now
B	mm
A	as if he felt like by saying that he was gonna get himself some erm
B	yeah
A	leeway by saying that as if you could just say that it as if he was
B	yeah
A	it mattered so little really
B	yeah
A	and then that's good enough for my country that's what it seemed like so I think he was middle eastern
B	mm
A	by the lingo
B	yeah
A	it's a cultural thing where that's just a little bit more acceptable
B	yeah
A	where you come from it's just you may have a mum and a sister but
