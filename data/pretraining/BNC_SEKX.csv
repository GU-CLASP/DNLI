A	yeah that bookshop was weird
B	right
A	so like they had lots of you you can tell when you touch the spine of a book if it's just a plastic cover or whether it's actually leather
B	right
A	or cloth binding
B	right
A	not worth anything
B	for nothing
A	for nothing
B	okay
A	mm?
A	yeah
B	oh just look at the fat fuck
B	and it's just who thinks that looks good?
A	to clarify for the sake of the recording we're talking about a car
A	we're not just sizeist
B	uh
A	yes
B	no
A	no it's not massively attractive but it's not quite so repellant
B	but if you need an SUV
A	yeah
B	well
A	yeah but
B	if you
A	if you're going to buy one
B	if you're deluded enough to get an SUV
A	yeah
B	then that's a good option
A	they really are very pretty
B	this is true
A	excellent
B	that was a question of you don't think too much about your
A	yeah
B	wing mirrors
B	mm
A	uh
B	it looks like council offices or something
A	right
B	mm
A	you'll actually find it's like
B	to be fair I'd have thought it would be quite effective purely cos there are no transport links to here
A	yeah
B	you see
A	is that the nearest one to here?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that or
A	right
B	you'd struggle to get far quickly
B	mm
A	it's all about escaped convicts
B	double F?
A	yeah
B	I've no idea
A	mm
B	yeah
A	they were? Yeah
B	mm
A	is it more of a big thing round here do you think? Like sort of mid-Wales
B	no
A	North Wales? Oh okay
B	South Wales it's virtually non-existent
A	right
B	Mid-Wales to some extent
A	right
B	mm
A	okay?
B	mm
A	is that the?
B	no
A	no
B	yes it is
A	yes
B	mm
A	so why would you bother if it was just a
B	well I suppose if you've got the facilities and the staff it kind of makes sense
A	mm
B	combine the two now there you've got a winner
B	to be fair if you do that you've pretty much got it coming
A	mm
B	you couldn't
A	you couldn't? Okay
B	mhm
A	to wear it I guess
B	and made damn sure of it
A	yeah
B	that's bad
A	what was it? I didn't see
B	someone's turned that sign round
A	oh
A	yeah
B	what?
A	cow legs
A	that's the kind of one where there's you know if massive herd of cows in middle of road stop
B	yeah I think that's basically how I'd er interpret it
A	that's yeah it's kind of hard to  hard to
B	mm
A	tiny little
B	mm
A	yeah I mean it's just it's nowhere near as remote as Ullapool and sort of northwards
B	mm
A	nice weather did you say?
B	yeah
A	yeah it's lovely
B	there is a lot to do
A	yeah
B	but no that's got its own attraction
A	well no definitely
B	mm
A	this is more touristy
B	it's just so much more densely populated
A	yeah
B	it's just
A	yeah there's just so many more people per bit of land
B	it wasn't exactly busy
A	it wasn't exactly busy
B	no I know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well seeing as it's come up nice we'll sort of I suggest
B	yes
A	with our er treats
B	never will anyone have been so pleased to see an apple
B	oh didn't you stroke them last time?
A	no I er just yeah they're big and got huge mouths and that
B	now this is where we had to persuade dad to do a interesting overtake once which
A	excellent
B	to be fair it moves
B	mm
A	no
B	that's what I do like about this car
A	it's very good
B	mm
A	yeah it's nice that you still kind of like it
B	mm
A	it's nice that it's actually a really good car
B	yes it is
A	mm
B	er doesn't suffer from  And so
A	yeah
B	for
A	yeah
B	it's brilliant around the city
A	yes
B	yes
A	so you're out to give yourself
B	yep
A	yep
B	I'm just trying to straighten it out
A	mm
B	weaves from side to side
A	yeah
B	doesn't mean you have to
A	yeah
B	yep
A	then it's shorter
B	yes
B	ah
B	mm
A	he didn't seem particularly er
B	hm?
A	he wasn't being completely communicative
B	mm
A	isn't it quite lovely and green
B	well we could potentially go down
A	um
B	beach wise
A	yeah to a beach wise
B	yeah
A	and we can maybe go later tonight if you want to
B	I think it'll be a mistake to do it more than anything else
A	er yeah
B	mm
A	and then tomorrow firstly when your leg's a bit had a chance to rest properly and also because there won't be much to do shop wise we'll go down to the beach
B	mm
A	cool
B	I'm just thinking as an outside suggestion
A	yeah?
B	and I don't consider it to be a particularly good runner but I will just mention it
A	yeah
B	er er but I think I sell you to a er slave ring
A	yeah
A	where's the catch?
B	um
A	it's not a great build up to a story
A	whoa
B	okay
A	Freaky dogs in the road
B	poodles
A	yeah
B	I was like I wouldn't say
B	er no no you you'll like it more than
B	um
A	Good
B	no in fairness I think it's quite good as in it is forcing relaxation on this stay
A	what the leg? Yes er
B	yeah
A	indeed yeah
B	mm
A	which I think is exactly what we need
B	mm
B	this road?
A	sixty?
B	yep
A	oh my God
B	to be fair the word that comes to mind with this road isn't safety
A	hm
B	ah
A	oh
B	ah
A	oh yes
B	I can't be bothered to try and
A	no don't
B	get into that space again
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	what bird?
A	that bird in the thing
B	oh look at those steps
A	oh
B	again they seem smaller than when I was a child
A	yes
B	that's one good
A	shall I er?
