A	you found Father Christmas?
B	at
A	oh did you?
B	yeah
A	when?
B	erm
A	well
B	ah
A	so I decided that's probably gonna be it
B	that's so sweet I quite fancy taking
A	yeah?
B	because erm
A	apparently it's
B	really?
A	apparently
B	oh
B	oh really?
B	no that sounds nice when this
A	no
A	no
B	well if he's scared then just like you say playgroup probably be best
A	mm
B	it'll probably be be very busy
A	mm
B	but they have a nice Father Christmas because they have a lot of erm
A	yeah
B	et cetera et cetera
A	yeah I yeah I think I might just stick to the playgroup I think it'll just be easier
B	yeah
A	I'm not bothered I'm not doing anything Christmassy I haven't even got an advent calendar
B	next year
A	mm
B	erm
A	which one?
A	oh yeah?
B	it's so difficult on their website they never tell you anything that's going on
B	oh I've missed it then
A	yeah I think so
B	I don't know if they only have one
A	mm
B	that was it it was only a couple weeks ago it was in November
A	mm
B	mm
A	although actually
A	I think Santa Claus was at that class there
A	so it might not matter how nice he is
B	oh okay
A	remember it's just the big beard
B	yeah I suppose it is a bit strange and the big boots
A	yeah
A	possibly all the hair if they're not used to it
B	maybe
A	yeah
B	mm
A	no I'm avoiding all of these things until I absolutely have to go
A	really?
B	and my father used to er dress up as Father Christmas
A	did he?
B	mm
A	for who for? just for you?
B	no
A	mm
B	and silks and things
A	mm
B	which was a really thing
A	mm
B	he always dressed up in shiny
B	and we get a present from Father Christmas and we didn't know it was him
A	did you not?
B	tell you did erm
A	yeah?
B	is er
A	is that cos he's already got a beard?
A	yeah that's true
B	oh it'll be somebody's husband
A	well it's at the church so it might be the vicar
A	let's hope not
B	it won't be the vicar
A	no I don't think it'll be the vicar
A	erm
B	mm
A	but
A	okay
B	are there lots of little ones there? or are they nearer to three?
A	no no they're all about the same
B	oh really so it's like a young playgroup?
B	yeah
A	a couple
A	they still like it cos they've got erm
B	mm?
A	and in the big hall they can just cycle around don't go round and round in circles
B	mm
A	so there's a few that come with two of them
B	mm
A	erm but no they're mostly sort of
B	mm
A	three and three quarters I think the oldest boy was yesterday
B	oh right
A	and he comes with his little sister who's about the same age as
B	mm
A	so yeah they're all
B	oh that's nice
A	it is it's really nice actually
B	yeah they start school by the time they're four so
A	I think it goes
B	mm
A	I think the tricycles and the scooters are
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm?
A	yeah they used to have one in
B	mm
A	erm
B	it's quite a long way to drive though it's nice just to walk to the
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	yeah
B	er
A	and he's going to playgroup with
B	what in the library?
A	no in the church
B	oh the Methodist church?
A	yeah a few people came up to me yesterday and said
A	mm
A	do you?
A	it's funny
B	yeah
B	mm
B	I said
A	mm
B	she wasn't very baby focused was she?
A	yes and no
B	oh right
A	all she wanted to talk about were
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	no I think that she's
A	she
B	I know
A	shouting and running around and yeah
B	I know it's very odd
A	I felt a bit rude to everyone after me leaving but I was like yeah we have really got to go
B	yeah well she should understand
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no she everything you said she just related to herself
A	yeah
B	she was very isolated I think so
B	she was very self-absorbed
A	mm
B	I think it's cos er
A	maybe
A	yeah definitely
B	but everything she said was
A	yeah
B	I got very bored
A	you only saw her for ten minutes
A	and half of that you were with
B	well when she started talking about
A	mm
B	I'm not bothered
A	mm
B	all I was saying is it's going well he's got a sports car
B	I asked
B	yeah
A	why? what? why would he?
A	why would he want that? he's got bad skin
B	well
A	well he's always got bad skin actually
B	every man should use moisturiser
A	has it worked yet?
B	no
B	and he said well he does use them sometimes but usually
A	oh
B	for Christmas and you can imagine actually
A	mm
B	so she'll get like Nivea Men or something
A	mm
B	so he said he does use them
A	mm
B	it's like
A	the number of men that use moisturiser?
A	yeah
B	skin product facial skin products
A	not very consistent though I've found so
B	oh right?
A	so
B	what like cream?
A	yeah so if you don't use it quickly enough it
B	the only guy I've found that uses Dr Hauschka is
A	yeah
B	who is on stage worldwide
A	he's got much more of a reason to
B	I hear he looks after himself he starts his morning by doing his pilates and
B	moisturises his face with Dr Hauschka
A	mm
B	he also has money but I mean he's
A	mm
B	appearing on stage and he's under lights and everything else
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	oh right but I thought
A	it's all like against all of the elements and blah blah blah
B	oh you used it then?
A	it takes a good like year
B	oh really?
A	I think so I've noticed I haven't noticed he's
B	what like a seal?
A	yeah he doesn't need his face hydrated at the moment cos he's just always in the water
B	or an otter?
A	he's in the water every day
B	it's not hydrated it's protection against the cold elements and the wind bad for your skin
A	he's alright at the moment actually I'm quite surprised I don't maybe he's using it I dunno
B	mm
A	but his face is alright at the moment
B	mm
A	and that's being in the river every single day
B	oh right there's obviously something in the river that's good for the skin then
A	mm
B	well it keeps it hydrated that's for sure
A	mm
B	what you going to use for
A	er what sun cream?
B	yeah
A	got some yeah I've got
A	no one's gonna
B	yeah there's more things come on sale this time of year
A	well they've just got a big old like
B	display case
A	reduced
B	oh okay
A	no it's just it's not on display it's just
B	oh right
A	candles and all sorts of odd things
B	oh okay
A	and cheap champagne sometimes and it's in there so erm
A	I don't yeah it doesn't really matter
B	oh okay that sounds good
A	cos I normally get the jungle fever which is the
B	yes
A	but I doesn't say you can use it
B	oh okay
A	that's what he reckoned
B	right
A	yeah as I say I think he was an aspiring or
B	yeah
A	his tablet and went blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I was like oh okay
B	that is good
A	yes
A	quite a lot of different it's quite confusing though there's quite a lot of different Skin So Soft products
B	whichever one you'll use
A	yeah
B	mm
B	mm no
B	and one can get those little electric plug-ins which we've probably got
A	yeah
A	they never seem to work
B	no they don't
A	mm
B	mm
A	but then
B	if
A	I'll just have
B	if you're lucky
A	tough luck
B	if you're lucky if you're lucky
A	ha
B	isn't it the next weekend?
A	it's not her birthday the next weekend
A	I think I'll make it for a little while
B	oh god's sake
A	I am being sensible
B	no no in terms of you haven't been to the country for how many years?
A	yeah
B	how many years?
A	six
B	right
A	and
B	you're going straight on the bus to
A	no not until the Friday and Saturday
B	and you
A	we arrive on Monday and this isn't until Friday
B	how long's the
A	I think it's only about three hours now actually
B	oh right
A	I'm I'm not taking
B	I don't think
A	also I just wrote to my
B	oh okay
A	it was still fun but not the same and really difficult for kids so
B	so erm car seats aren't actually legal in Ecuador?
A	what do you mean?
B	I mean here you have to have a car seat
A	probably not no
B	no
A	but I'm on it I've asked
B	but
A	yeah she doesn't drive though
A	well I was asking her and she said she takes taxis
B	mm
A	her the little boy
B	anyway
B	okay but you can't borrow it cos neither of you drive
A	no
B	that's why
A	mm
A	yeah
B	I'm sure that's why he took it before
A	mm
A	the nice older half so he went canoeing
B	wow that's great
A	A they've put him on
B	yeah
A	with the canoe club
A	I reckon they've probably put him on the insurance so that he can drive them all home and they can have a drink
A	oh of course
B	it's quite funny but no it's not not true
A	yes and back again
B	that's brilliant
B	because that's what he needs because when he passes his test that's what he'll be doing
A	exactly
A	I think it a couple of them said it had bought their insurance down
A	which it can do
B	that's really sweet
A	so yeah
B	really? no it's not that you still have responsibilities and
A	yes but I think it's quite nice for them
B	no I think it's even worse that's very generous of them
A	I think yeah
A	well there we go
B	cos it's the awareness of other road users
A	yeah
B	which
A	there we go
B	you know? cos I think he's got the mechanics
A	yeah
B	of
A	yeah
B	control of the car
A	yeah
B	it's the road sense
A	yeah that's it
B	which is why he's failed twice and
A	yeah
B	you don't get in till you've got that
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah I thought so
B	well gosh he's like their personal mascot isn't he?
B	oh that's quite
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	oh nice
B	which'll be nice yeah
A	yeah it is nice
B	and I'm
A	oh cool
B	and
B	so I've I've
A	I don't think I'll be able to come anyway cos
B	is he?
A	well he's going I think it's Sunday
B	is he driving?
A	Monday I don't think so
A	it's for his water endorsement
B	well he can't drive on the motorway anyway cos he's a learner driver
A	no exactly
A	on their new trips up to Wales he'll be able to drive
B	well
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so is water endorsement
A	no
B	oh right?
A	he's another bloke who works at yeah
B	yeah yeah
B	level three what?
A	er coaching
B	mm
A	and then I think I've had enough for a while I think he can stop for a bit
B	well no then he's got his ML
A	yes after that that's it then he I think I might put a ban on any more courses until
B	well it's not putting a ban it's that
A	I think it's enough cos she knows
B	it becomes economically
A	yeah exactly
B	apart from canoe club who've been incredibly supportive
A	yeah
B	in his volunteering event
A	yeah
B	but I mean that's part of if he gets another chance to negotiate
A	yeah I mentioned it the other day actually
B	he needs to decide what he wants and go back to
A	yeah
B	negotiate
A	yeah
B	they were probably quite surprised that he didn't apply for the
A	they were I think that's why they mentioned it he reckons that's why they
B	yeah
A	so if it's not sorted out if I haven't
B	therefore he needs to go back with what he would like
A	yes but also they also came out and said
B	yeah
A	that he'll need to
B	don't worry about it I mean just er keep keep it keep it live keep it rolling but
A	yeah
B	he would have all these qualifications and then I should imagine in September he'll want to be
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	working
A	which is fine
B	so the ML is the next big one er but he won't necessarily get it first time anyway
A	yeah
B	but certainly with the water sports the amount of
A	mm
B	experience
A	yeah
B	well he didn't have his driving lessons last year and so he automatically couldn't've
A	well he
B	have got the
A	and they were surprised
B	mm
A	that he didn't because quite a few others did
B	oh yeah yeah
A	but I just thought it was all a bit weird
B	yeah yeah
A	the ex-professional rugby player who makes honey
A	no no one's got it
B	no it's the it's
A	they've got driving licenses which I think are gonna be
B	you can drive the bus but people can
A	yeah exactly
A	anyway so
A	so none of them as far as I know none of them got the qualifications
B	no no it's quite rare
A	and it's also
B	to do level three
A	also with the
B	mm
A	yeah
B	we've got coaches like
A	mm
B	who is actually doing level three isn't he?
A	yeah
B	but they've been at it since the year dot but it's because the BCU's changed the entire system
A	yeah
B	erm
A	well I would imagine they'd accept
B	no
A	got equivalents
B	no
A	oh
B	what I'm saying
A	oh right okay
B	it's a completely different system
A	mm
B	it's like
A	yeah
B	and so you can say well I haven't got A levels but I've got baccalaureate and if people say
A	yeah
B	doesn't matter if you got A levels cos they're so out of date
A	mm
B	and you can always date someone if they say I've got a
A	O level?
B	yeah
B	they'll think you're really really old
A	yeah
B	so it's quite rare this level three and he's getting on it
A	yeah
B	industry
A	it's very hard yeah
B	yeah
A	and this he's only gotta go up and do the training in February and it takes about two years I think so he's not gonna get the actual
B	oh really?
A	oh yeah
B	yeah went for sea kayaking it was based in the South West
A	yeah
B	but the sea kayaking you get a lot of families that want to go out and they
A	yeah
B	need someone to guide them
A	I think he is
A	at some point in the future
B	well that comes with the the profession so
A	yeah
B	it's in terms of tourism travel it's a better one than white water
A	yeah
B	white water is quite specialised
A	yeah
B	and so he's got his four star white water which is nice he needs to go
A	yeah
B	in white water so
A	yeah
B	it's a pretty impressive portfolio but
A	mm
B	they don't
A	oh no they they do
B	they
A	yeah
B	he just needs to push it
A	yeah
B	as a thing
A	yeah I think so too
A	I don't he I don't know if he knows what he wants I dunno if he wants
B	yeah you need to see er
A	and how much you want
B	when is he around?
A	err
B	yeah I thought they would
A	I knew they would
B	but it's quite late you could've told them three weeks ago
A	I still would've got told off
B	yeah but not as badly
A	she also said
A	so she didn't tell me off that badly but she did
A	it's only a day
B	oh he loves you
A	he
B	if one day in your life and your life is is thirty-four years long
A	that's what I keep telling
A	I was like yeah that's like two years in baby life
A	yeah
B	oh don't worry I'll just see him
A	and then he's finished
B	I'll just see him
A	yes
