A	bit ridiculous
B	well you've seen our ridiculous wine glasses of course? No
C	what's that?

B	oh I'm sorry I thought it
A	I I I'll give them a ring and just sort of find out what the thing
B	yeah
A	I mean to be honest em I'll just I'll I'll probably just em get them to deliver it to the
B	of course yeah
A	which would be probably just as easy as you going to get it em
C	that looks good
B	yeah
A	if they if they do it
C	and how long is the guarantee period with them?
A	A year
C	oh right
A	but I figured like the service there is really good and if you did have any bother
C	yes
B	but I think it's really unlikely to break in that time period
A	oh no yeah exactly but I just
B	as in the reliability of iPods didn't use to be amazing but ever since iPad then everything's been superb
A	yeah
B	you know ever since
A	yeah I think my first one was older than any of the ones you've had wasn't it?
B	yeah considerably
A	yeah
B	Cos mine was the first like the new nano was the first generation of what you might term new iPods I E colour screens
A	yes
B	oh okay
A	that was the first big one with a colour screen
B	yeah but the mini wasn't colour it was black and white
A	no no exactly
B	em mine actually
C	mam said you can
B	you could buy mine at the same time as the mini
C	you can steam those a while if you want
A	hmm
B	Cos I remember looking at a mini and thinking
B	ooh I could get that
A	you might snaffle what?
B	some cheese
A	some cheese? Eh do we have a grater?
C	yes they're up on the top shelf on the side here
B	oh great we've got a grater
A	in in here?
C	yeah up on the top shelf on the
B	that's left
A	yep
C	that's it it's that little thing sticking there we go
A	oh
C	that's it
A	ooh that is a grater
C	now you can grate however much you want into a little bowl or or even directly onto the food if if that's what you're gonna do
A	eh we'll have it in a bowl I think
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	is there a microwave?
A	yes
C	yes
A	that's good
C	which bits?
B	microwave
A	well I mean do you wanna do both packs or do you wanna do that pack for now and then see how we get on?
B	no we need both packs
A	mm
B	we get through one pack just us
A	but I mean do you want to do them all or do you want to keep some because? I guess use we've used less than a full pack
C	we're not really gonna  We're not really gonna  eat fourteen wraps are we?
B	there's not fourteen there are there?
A	yeah
B	well we'd eat
C	I didn't know you could microwave wraps
A	oh yeah
B	yeah it's the best way of doing it
C	well I thinkMam might cook them in the oven but eh I might be wrong on that one
B	yeah you just pop it in the microwave for two minutes
A	yeah you you you
B	fanny's your aunt
A	chicken's ready
C	A lot of fluid's coming out of the veg?
A	yeah
B	em
A	do you have serious recycling or is this just to? I guess the cardboard goes there
C	yeah you can
A	plastic or
C	eh I don't really get too excited
B	recycling doesn't seem to have made if you're this far off
C	oh
B	well as in in our neck of the woods it's two
A	it's just
B	to one ratio recycling to normal waste
C	oh right
A	they're mad keen on it
C	we've got
A	A
C	A little box that sits on top that we put the newspapers in?
A	yeah a tub
C	eh twice in the past couple of months the the operatives have slung that bin away
A	slung?
A	right
B	it's probably recyclable plastic
C	I've had to  I've had to  phone them up and we've had two new ones and
A	oh
C	then it's this oh yeah that happens all the time sir
A	yeah
B	when you say operatives that sounds like sort of black ops you know
A	yeah
B	someone's going to break into your house in a black balaclava and empty your bin out
C	yeah they are called hygiene operatives
A	A bowl em
C	what's that? Do you want either one of those?
A	eh
C	there's a breakfast bowl there
A	yeah I'll have one of those? Do you want to grate?
B	yeah and can I have a sharp knife please
B	sorry?
A	I wish I'd never taught you the expression snaffle now
B	that's the badger
A	oh
B	something that might amuse you erm
C	yeah
B	which included em eh
A	yep
C	no
A	you'd be a little
A	you'd feel bad wouldn't you?
B	and there there was another one where em which was eh
A	which is quite at claim to make
C	they're not doing themselves any favours are they
B	well not
A	is is
C	what's that?
C	I don't know
A	or
B	try and find out
A	or we can stick them on the microwave plate if it's
C	I don't know
A	I'll I'll try
C	just just have a quick chat she might have eh
B	he's planning on writing a book of all of these
C	excuse me for interfering
B	mm
C	there is a lot of liquid comes out the vegetables isn't there
B	yeah particularly mushrooms actually
A	mam doesn't know
B	mm
A	yeah
B	is this a superbly good grater for this? It's very fine
A	it'll melt really nicely
C	ah there's a chip on one of the glasses I don't believe it
A	oh
C	that must have been put away like that
B	yeah I'm not convinced this is gonna work
C	is it because the type of cheese is is?
B	no I think it's just the grater's designed for something a bit more delicate
C	alright well we we might
B	yeah as in this is working but very slowly
A	em
B	maybe I put too much
A	if I do?
C	I'll just get another grater out of there
A	right
C	first
A	and they'll be still warm
C	actually there's some
A	ooh sorry
B	fiendish
C	oh well
A	I think this is probably not far off
B	ah
A	yeah that's good
B	mm
A	alright
B	that's the badger
A	that is the badger
C	hmm
B	again I think cheap cheese is better for grating
A	it is too good quality
B	let's put some crumbled cheese in
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	I'll just put your scarf out here Sarah
A	oh yeah sure
B	eh huh
B	well it's hardly offensive is it?
A	no no it's just
B	of all the possible expressions you could come out with I think that's a fairly harmless one
A	yeah
B	you gotta
B	em I can't really grate the rest of this
A	do you see what I mean like cos they're not in the same room?
B	eh huh
B	right
A	ah
C	do you want me to mop up that cheese?
B	what cheese?
A	that that cheese that's under yeah
C	that cheese on the floor
C	there we are
A	ah
B	no
A	oh see that's the problem
B	my feet are exceptionally clean thank you
A	hmm
B	what's wrong with a foot? You've got a real prejudice against feet
A	I don't like feet
B	oh sorry
C	there you go
A	actually one might be enough
B	you think?
B	what?
B	we'll just pop
A	aside
C	we'll just pop him on the side
A	mm
B	no one will know he's here
A	hang on
B	ah
B	that on there
C	look
B	right
C	in the rim
B	yeah
C	apparently you can microwave wraps? Had you known that?
A	how do you make it live?
B	power
A	oh power
B	at a guess
A	turn it off
B	I I'm thinking that one sauce is fine
A	yeah I think that's fine
B	em possibly so
A	did you want to turn it off?
B	it's fine
B	what does everyone keep this up for?
A	we can turn it off
B	Will he be okay there?
A	he'll be fine
C	mam may not be
A	yeah I was gonna say
B	he doesn't like to be turned off
A	em plates
B	yes indeed
C	well they might be a bit chilly
A	the food doesn't sit on there for very long if I
B	it's probably the mechanism  without touching the table
A	shall we leave that on?
C	is it inhibiting your conversation?
A	I'll turn it off
B	in a minute?
A	no I'll turn it off
B	hang on I'll do it
