A	yeah
B	yeah and riding a motorbike as well
B	you you there's a
B	you don't
B	and actually that is the same way that Northern Ireland people who are not on a motorbike also greet each other in the street
A	oh nice
B	so if you pass somebody on the street in Northern Ireland you there's that same sort of shake of the head sort of like a
A	mm mm
A	I see that you are there
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	but actually that's
B	or at least make eye contact with people
A	yeah
B	and I find even where I live where you would expect that anybody you're passing is a neighbour within
A	yeah
B	a two-minute walk
A	yeah
B	it just doesn't happen so
A	I
A	why do they do that?
A	but erm

A	mm
B	worked in the business world I climbed the ladder
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm mm
B	part of the
A	yeah but no but
B	since I ticked the opt out box on the rat race I don't think I've ever been happier and I certainly haven't
A	yeah
B	ever had a period in life as I've had in the last two or three years where I'm learning so much about myself
A	mm mm
B	I think it's part of that freedom and part of that being so open to everything and anything
A	yeah
B	hooray
A	I sort of said from the beginning
B	good for you
A	erm my friend er is just
B	mm
A	so the first article was about er people who are teaching English as a foreign language abroad so he's interviewed me and a friend who lives in Spain and another friend who lives somewhere else
A	er so I've just decided never to do it
B	yeah
A	then we all said in these interviews you know like
B	yeah
A	yeah it's a job like any job
B	mm
A	erm and sometimes you know you're sat in your room watching Iplayer wondering if it's all worth it when you're so far from your family
B	mm
A	erm but the
B	yeah
A	this sort of job erm
B	aha
A	and in the summers when you're working in England you're like touching base with other people who do
B	yeah
A	have the same feelings that there's more to it than
B	yeah nine to five rat race
A	nine to five yeah
B	and is part of that
A	mm mm
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah

A	there's more there's more there's more
A	goodness me
A	fucking what next?

B	I yeah I think a more key question
A	yeah am I happy?
B	absolutely yeah
A	er
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	touch base time
B	yeah
B	yeah but I think there's no harm in having a focus on where am I here now?
A	mm mm
A	yeah
B	and change partners okay
A	yeah
B	no it is good to question
A	mm mm
B	and gratitude plays a big part for me
