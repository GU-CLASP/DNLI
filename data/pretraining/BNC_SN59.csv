A	to check out the potential sources of money and how much they might provide
B	yeah
A	one of which obviously is your own money the Lottery fund
B	mm
A	Landfill Community fund
B	mm
A	Local Government and kind of
B	yeah
A	and the diocese
B	yeah
A	and a lot of diocese have the means one way or another if they really think you are a good cause to put some money up in one way or another
B	mm
A	so I think you have to test all of those out
B	yeah
A	erm but there's an awful lot just again I mean it is the same thing people here that won't stay with the project in
B	yeah
A	well because you can't
B	no
A	you are not at that church in
B	yeah
A	it will happen once in a generation that some money is
B	yes
A	so they need to find out what is a realistic thing
B	yeah
A	and what they realistically think they could raise from those sources
B	yeah
A	and that has to be there because otherwise you do what you have done they've done at
B	yes
A	what iconic building? well iconic buildings cost ten times as much as non-iconic buildings
B	mm
A	so you actually have to have enormous pragmatism because the people who are going to fund you if it is outside funders are going to do the sums and say why should we pay you a thousand pounds a square metre to put in a community centre when these people down the road can do it for two hundred pounds a square metre?
B	yes
A	let's go with the ones down the road and then we can build five centres for the price of your one
B	yes unless you have got a grade one listed building and everybody agrees that no matter what it costs it has to be preserved because this is such an important national treasure which
A	well that's preserving it which comes from a different cause than adapting it
B	yes
A	because now there is much better funds than when we started for preserving listed places of worship
B	yes but as long as they are exceptional I mean even
A	no but it gets
B	the world wouldn't end if it somebody knocked it down
A	it could get grants if it wasn't a bit of a pig's ear in terms of who was applying for the money if the parish would apply for the prepare money they'd get money straight away
B	mm
A	from the Heritage Lottery fund as a place as a listed place of worship but the bricks get treated as an oddity when they do it and that's because and the parish are silly silly they don't understand that this is what keeps them there some of those one or two who were on the PCC when I was working there
B	I know some of the new ones just absolutely don't understand and you do a feel bit like
A	no but what you are dealing with is the fact that because it has gone so badly wrong
B	yeah
A	and so much money was wasted there wasn't a single grant maker of the trust and foundation who would ever give it money
B	no
A	because I approached them all I approached a hundred and none of them would give us any money not a penny
B	oh really
A	you didn't know that did you?
B	no I didn't
A	I just realised you didn't
B	no
A	and that's because the track record there was rubbish
B	yes
A	they had had all the money and they had wasted it
B	yeah
A	so why would you give them any more?
B	yeah and also going back through the history now and reading a lot of the archive materials there are from the the people who were around who were responsible for that particular phase of history their rhetoric they were going round
A	but that's fairly
B	and all that sort of stuff
A	it is the same kind of waffle
B	yeah
A	that we were getting to which we said no
B	yeah but the letters I saw a whole series of letters to
A	wasn't that the past manager?
B	yes
A	he was bent
B	yeah but then the vicar was one of the vicars was mad one of the vicars is now a hermit in
A	how weird
B	I know
A	one the one who was there when they got the money from central government to adapt the building is dead
B	oh right
A	so yeah there were obviously others
B	yeah
A	but yeah it is that same thing of all bluster
B	yeah
A	that doesn't work
B	no
A	I put it in I did a second article a second column because of being away on holiday about churches whose income doesn't meet their projected expenses and I put in it emotive or passion of exhortation doesn't make people change their giving because they used the passion of exhortation
B	mm
A	in advertising and they don't buy everything from everyone who gives them the old the story so it is not going to work when you ask people to reconsider their church giving
B	no
A	what you actually have to give them is the considered and careful
B	yeah
A	presentation about the real cost and their a recommended level of giving for people to think over for themselves
B	yes
A	and I think that passion of exhortation is one of our worst enemies
B	yes well actually if you when you watch Channel 5 is it Channel 5? with those adverts all the time for
B	and if you watch any amount of Channel 5 you could see that four times a day
A	can you?
B	with this piece of music and these pictures of dying children and stuff like that
A	it's rubbish
B	and you do feel god I must be hard
A	I don't know if they
B	hard for not
A	still stuck with it but about fifteen years ago Christian Aid made the decision that erm
B	mm
A	and it goes along with an ad that was around a long time ago for a donkey sanctuary
B	oh right yes
A	and basically there was a skittish donkey in a paddock kind of kicking its heels up and their their brand their line was make sad donkeys happy and apparently they got more response than could ever be expected from that
B	oh
A	there were several styles to advertising and
A	and stuff like that but I mean I've translated it to that because people give to the RNLI
B	yeah
A	not because of the stupid sailors that get drowned but because of the heroic seaman
B	yes
A	so if you put a seaman going out to rescue them in his sowester and the rain pouring down in buckets on his head then people will give money because he is a hero
B	mm
A	but if you showed the sailor drowning they would say you stupid bugger why would I give you any money all that stuff so you actually have to know what you are doing and the the the vicar on the cover is rubbish
B	mm
A	that might have worked in the nineteen eighties
B	is that what about fat jolly smiling black lady vicars do they?
A	a fat jolly black lady might work
B	mm
A	but I do tend to use small groups of friendly looking people on my stuff
B	mm
A	I think that picture we did at the
B	yes
A	with the whole
B	with the wedding on the working party on the back or if not wedding party
A	well it is not a wedding party I just moved everyone out onto the steps one Sunday morning and took a picture of them all out there
B	mm
A	and made them wave at mast and I think that was good
B	mm
A	because that said a lot about our mix
B	oh yes now absolutely
B	just like a thousand words
A	exactly so er
B	mm
A	not an advantage
B	mm
A	you do need champions but you need ones that have definitely definitely got it all feet on the ground stuff who have your entire business plan up their sleeve
B	yes
A	erm and I can ask for money and get it on a face to face basis
B	mm
A	as well as through bids but I will only do it for projects where I think are good and good means they have been thought through and they are not going to fail them you are not going to put a million pounds in and then find in two years that it has gone
B	yeah what somebody else is reaping the benefit of it the first organisation actually hitting the decks as soon as they open the door
A	yes
B	because they haven't thought about what is going to happen when they open the door
A	exactly exactly
B	and somebody else inherits a lovely building
A	it happens
B	buys it for a song because erm
A	but anyway so that part so I think that's the second stage
B	mm
A	is finding out how much money you might have available then you talk to the architect as if you are designing a new building and you say these are the needs we want to meet
B	mm
A	these are the actual needs we want to meet they are not hypothetical
B	yeah
A	they are real we want this is the kind of timetable we are running this is the size of groups that need to be in this is how long they will be in erm and etc
B	yeah
A	and this is the kind of money we could think we could possibly raise in order to do the work so can you start talking to us about how this might be designed
B	yeah
A	and an architect can always do it for less money
B	yes
A	I can never get
B	mm
A	but that's what he needed to have said
B	yes
A	and I said it to him directly and indirectly in enough ways that he should have got the message but it was always off putting to set up a meeting with him and
B	oh right okay because
A	yeah but I think
B	no
A	you see what I mean?
B	yes
A	it's erm he hasn't got the access for making a decision like that
B	no
A	and if he goes off to see
B	no okay
A	anyway that's another story so I think the last thing is to go to the architect and say this is what we need here's the kind of money you will have available to do it with
B	yeah
A	and even in a grade one church you could do that
B	yeah
A	you can have a modest servery that costs no more than it would in an unlisted building
B	yes
A	functionally it is exactly the same
B	yes
A	you might spend ten pounds more or you spend a little more on the external panelling so it looks suited to the building and you wouldn't have formica you would have to have to have wood but no
B	mm
A	it's not significantly different
B	mm
A	but I think the word I used is modest
B	mm
A	you want a modest adaptation in other words one that is not being designed not being done so that it can be iconic or aspirational or whatever else it is only a servery for heaven's sake or a toilet do you see what I mean?
B	yes
A	so
B	so actually and also in that case that means the architect is just part of the scenario it is not oh look at this
A	mm
B	we actually don't want
A	exactly
B	in the architectural journal I will be
A	you want someone who will actually look at what you need and provide it
B	yes
A	even if there nobody can tell they have done their work afterwards
B	no
A	because it's so ordinary
B	yeah they need to be invisible actually when it's done
A	yeah
B	so it's not it's if it's not their
A	and that is fine
B	not their bloody building actually
A	well no it's not their building they think it is
B	yeah
A	one of
B	yeah
A	erm and so I do get erm drama queens among the architects divas
B	yeah
A	erm but it isn't
B	no
B	mm
A	it's the older ones who are now thinking of erm heritage no what's the word? tut
B	er their erm
A	yeah
B	their bequests their erm
A	gift to the world
B	yeah their yeah it's not their inheritance it's the other way isn't it? their erm
A	yeah anyway
B	yeah yeah
A	and I these words if I don't use them very often they do drift away these days
A	erm but once I've remembered them I can hold onto them quite well
A	sometimes it takes a day to remember them
B	yes they sort of come to you in the middle of the night
A	erm yeah middle of the night stuff erm so you really don't need that kind of architect who's getting to the end of their architectural career and wants to leave their imprint
B	yeah
A	you really
B	legacy
A	a legacy yes that's right their legacy and erm tut that's a nightmare when they do that
B	mm yeah
A	and of course in the church sector a lot of practices that work with churches are that senior partner who wants to work on the grade one building everybody wants to work on a grade one building and leave something in it because they know it'll be there in four hundred years' time oh there's what so and so did
B	yeah that's true that's true
A	well no sorry that's
B	well there's a very interesting
A	we need to know we're like the Victorian architecture which is ours won't last as long as this
B	no but er there was an article in The Guardian yesterday where people have spatchcocked new bits onto old edifices so you know that little portico that's half way down
A	yeah
B	the little Doric chapel entrance which used to be
A	yeah
B	the entrance to a school
A	yeah I know
B	the school's gone and they've got a multistorey block of flats before but with this sort of white this white portico with Doric
A	on the front yes that's right
B	yeah but
A	yeah
B	that they've put inside it
A	right
B	it's a bit like us I suppose but
A	there's one at
B	yeah there's one the same that's in
A	yeah
B	and the article was all about do you know what? keeping these bits for prosperity can be the wrong
A	yeah there's one in er
B	mm
A	a metre from the walls of the church
B	mm
A	on either side and it fits inside like a hand in glove
B	mm
A	and you can actually walk er entirely round the glass box
B	oh right
A	I don't know if they do that now I don't know how that architect worked that
B	no
A	it tends to be the criteria if it is reversible
B	yes
A	in other words you could take it out
B	yes
A	and actually that is not difficult to achieve at all
B	no no I don't know whether ours would be actually
A	well the stuff we have done would be
B	yes
A	but it is the stuff that the previous people did all that poured concrete probably wouldn't be
B	well I don't know apparently it is not pinned into the wall apparently it is just it is just sitting inside the case
A	oh right that's alright
B	which is why you have got drops in the windows
A	oh right
B	where you can actually see down but obviously you would just end up with an empty box
A	when that building was converted in the late seventies early eighties it didn't have a faculty
B	no but then
A	but it had permission to do it
B	no but then I've heard from three different sources now about how the bishop was the bishop just had a I don't know some mental aberration of find a piece of paper and broke all the rules
A	he did he did he did
B	and broke all the procedures
A	he did
B	whatever and I mean I I am like the guy
A	I think it is that typical big thing that because of all the rioting in
B	mm
A	and this vicar was exhorting and saying this is what needs to happen
B	mm
A	without any grounds for saying it
B	no but
A	I know who the bishop was and that you are absolutely right it was the bishop's letter that gave permission they didn't go through any of the right processes and that's how they got permission to do it and actually the same bishop commented some fifteen years later on it would have been around the time we were working basically in those days we did a lot of things which with hindsight we wouldn't have done
B	it would be allowed today
A	it was totally the wrong way to deal with that building
B	but it was another building
B	yes
A	why wasn't it in one of those corner staircases?
B	yeah
A	and then the building would have been much more adaptable
B	yes absolutely and you wouldn't have that disorientation you get when you go round and round and round you can't work out which way you are facing I still have people working for me it says north I go no south they have no idea in the building which way they are facing and you can't see out
A	yes
B	you know it is a bizarre really in that sense
A	it is bizarre
B	but erm
A	well it was a pig's ear
B	yeah
A	and we have made it a useable pig's ear but it is still a pig's ear it is never going to be a silk purse
B	no
A	it never was before it was started actually
B	no well on the inside it was very it was going to be very plain but as you said much much erm earlier in this conversation built for two thousand people so all these people replicated there oh yes we need space for two thousand but actually no we probably never needed a place for two thousand
A	no no
B	never ever ever needed a space to two thousand
A	and if you go back to the numbers I know it was built for two thousand because the whole of
B	no
A	and even though all the churches in
B	no
A	that was never ever full
B	no you
A	no and there were so many churches I could find you around the country where the gallery is never used
B	yes and the galleries were just junk because there was nobody up there
A	oh absolutely always full of junk
B	and never ever been anybody up there and in fact actually when they converted
A	are all around the gallery
B	things that they've left are the gallery blocked in
A	yeah
B	so the gallery was always disposable there as well not needed
A	yeah I know been there when they not so long after they had done it it was an awful long time ago
B	I still haven't got in there
A	it was shoddy
B	oh really I still haven't managed to get in there I will have to go I am going to have to go to church there or something one Sunday to get in there to have a look it seems to be the only way to get in there and have a look I mean today you can't even find out who ruddy runs it
A	is there a vicar
B	probably but I think we have tried I've tried in the past to go round all of them and have a look in all of them and I managed
A	yeah
B	not that you can even park in there or anything
A	no it is a bit mad
B	mm
A	from what it has been through has been quite interesting
B	mm
A	that was the church which actually lost the Arch Deacon his job he was encouraged to retire where a bunch of clergy this is way off
B	mm
A	and erm
B	right
A	and the Arch Deacon then challenged them
B	ah
A	and he lost his job which he should have done
B	oh did he not think that he was in some kind of leadership role?
A	I don't know what he was thinking he was a very nice guy in some ways I mean he was quite helpful to me when
B	mm
A	they haven't got the brains and whatever but of course they have
B	ah
A	anyway whatever it was he made the
B	of well a lot of them
B	a lot of them feel they are able to say that now
A	well they aren't allowed to say it unless they've already previously voted to go into the stream
B	oh I see
B	right
A	you can only be in that category if you've made a prior decision
B	right
A	which I still think is a bit of an old fudge is it worth it? this is going to be interesting one of the most highly recommended people to be the first woman bishop in the Church of England is black
B	I know
A	I know her quite well she would be quite good I mean she would as good as any other crappy male vicar I mean bishop I don't think she will be stunning in lots of ways
B	and what about
A	oh she wants it like the end of
B	yeah
A	they asked her in church the other day and she said I wouldn't even think about my own she said I am praying that they would choose the right person bloody hell does she want it
B	well I knew her when she was starting out I knew her in the early eighties in
A	in the
B	yes
A	she might be I mean but I know there are a lot of women
B	she is nice and she is capable there's no reason why she shouldn't
A	she is nice and she is capable my only reason for her not having it is that she thinks she should
A	she thinks she is the best I mean it is like the male clergy behaving like erm but
B	oh right yes I've heard her name
A	who really really well she is the Queen's chaplain at somewhere and she's chaplain to the House of
B	I know that would be
A	if they turn up you will always get a ticket what time do you have yours till?
B	two fifty-three
A	we have got five minutes what do you want to do? shall we go and put another ticket in for five minutes and then have a cup of tea before you go?
B	okay I could do that couldn't I
A	because you can put in the shortest limit one
B	yes that's true
A	it might even be a sixty P one down there
B	yeah
A	you have got more than you've got a lot of time on that
B	I know I stopped it and started it again when your phone rang
A	yeah
B	which erm
A	I can't remember how much an hour is
B	have you got a pound's worth of change and then I can erm
A	I have a system now for when I go to
B	I am allowed to renew aren't I it is not one of those ones?
A	no no no you just put the money in and get another ticket you don't have to go away
B	have you erm
A	oh well that's alright
B	I will give you some
A	that's alright that will go in my piggy bank it is okay
A	they will all go in my piggy bank because every once in a while
