A	oh yeah so do I
B	and I said yeah yeah yeah that's no problem and then I remembered on the way home so I text her straight back and said remembered on the way home actually I'm out
A	mm
B	and then
A	they're going out for a dinner
B	for a family meal
A	yeah
B	erm they're expensive aren't they children when they're
A	come home and you take them
B	you take them out you know a family meal or whatever
A	yeah why was he home? he's only just gone back
B	I don't
A	oh
B	something to do with a revision week or something
A	oh
B	I'm not sure erm so
A	she did send me a text obviously directing me to the website and telling me if there's anything I needed but there's nothing I want if I'm honest I think I perhaps would have try and come up with an excuse anyway cos cos you do feel obliged to buy and there wasn't there's nothing I want
B	no
A	had a load of
B	no no no no no
A	don't need anything
B	and obviously she is going to rely on repeat
A	yes yeah
B	once people have bought a hand cream or a face cream
A	mm
B	they're gonna need it again
A	mm if they like it yes
B	mm
A	there's a huge erm Neal's Yard shop at up at
B	is there?
A	mm
B	oh
A	huge
B	it's probably cheaper you're not paying the rep's commission
A	I don't know I would have thought it would be the same price wouldn't you? cos it's in the brochure they've got a brochure I didn't go in actually
B	oh
A	but I assumed it would be the same price
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	I suppose so
A	because the in the in the
B	well they must be making a lot then to be
A	well in the shop you're paying a lot in terms of overheads aren't you?
B	mm
A	especially in the location it's in
B	mm
A	and the staff and all there is to
B	it's nice in there isn't it?
A	it is nice yeah yeah
B	we had a look when we went up to the erm German market
A	mm
B	had a little wander in there
A	I was up there last last Thursday
B	was you now?
A	lunchtime yes
B	oh yes how did that go?
A	oh it was fine
B	where where was your lunch with
A	well we just meet at the erm at the art gallery and museum just in their tea rooms have you ever been in the tea rooms there?
B	oh yes I have yeah
A	they're quite nice yeah just
B	and just have a little conflab a cup of tea
A	just have a
B	and biscuits?
A	yeah just well just have a bite to eat and chat and go home again
B	so is it other people that do the proofreading is it?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	it was about probably about twelve of us there
B	and how often do you meet for that then?
A	it's every other month
B	oh so it's kind of an official meeting? it's kind of something that you need to
A	yes it is even
B	no
A	and it's and it is very very informal you literally just go and chat but it was the lady there that asked me if I'd proofread this book cos she's erm she's the one that I've done a couple for before
B	that's right yeah
A	so so you know it's worthwhile going just for that
B	well yeah
A	but erm they are a frumpy bunch though
B	are they?
A	they're very nice
B	are they your age or older?
A	well they'd be my age or older
B	mm
A	I would say there's no many young one or two younger they're just
B	it's a good job though isn't it?
A	I dunno they're just
B	suppose you've got to be erm educated yourself obviously to pick up on other people's errors punctuation and things
A	I dunno but anyway they are they're nice enough they're just
B	you won't suggest a night out then?
A	no no
B	plain people
A	plain anyway they're very nice but yes
B	sometimes plain is good
A	yes I went up there and I had a little wander round the shops first it was nice
B	well do you know what I did? when's your nanny's birthday it's very soon
A	mum's?
B	your nanny's
A	oh her nan's
B	it's really soon
A	it's a week today is that the second? it's a week today
B	are you gonna are you gonna go?
A	oh we'll have to I'll just go with
B	will you go with
A	will as well
B	you'll be alright then
A	and maybe
B	that's a shame
A	they told me that they said oh are you visiting
B	it's a shame isn't it?
A	it's so she just oh well I bought Minstrels for her actually
B	well I could have
A	and I
B	I could have took them off your hands cos I love chocolate raisins
A	do you? well she likes them she sucks away on them
B	but I'm not eating chocolates
A	she's happy
B	I'm not eating chocolate
A	oh no how's that going?
B	cos they're too sweet really well
A	oh great
B	haven't even thought about it
A	how much weight have you lost?
B	oh I don't think any
A	oh I think you have
B	I need to get on the scales want my boobs to go so
A	I think you have
B	I really have had enough I have funny had enough of
A	oh have you?
B	my boobs
A	oh
B	I hate them
A	well
B	they're such a nuisance they are
A	you were going to save up for a reduction op weren't you?
B	no I wouldn't no no
A	or was that
B	yeah no I would never mess with nature
A	no that was my friend's my friend
B	yeah
A	cos hers are huge too
B	yeah it wouldn't even be the cost if I'd got the money I wouldn't
A	no
B	cos it I just think
A	no I don't blame you no
B	no
A	you just don't know what might go wrong
B	you just don't know do you but oh I don't like them
A	well you I think you have lost a bit of weight so it's doing
B	do you think?
A	yeah I do actually
B	oh good
A	so I didn't
B	it's noticeable?
A	get a chance yeah I thought so
B	oh
A	so if all you've had to do is cut out oh that's I think that sounds quite hard chocolate and sweets was it?
B	yeah but but
A	yeah you crave it
B	the want and the desire can you know great
A	yes yeah
B	greater than great but just by thinking right I can't have any more I can't have any chocolate or sweets sweets don't bother me anyway
A	no
B	never think about having a sweet but chocolate yes as you know I'm rather you know
A	mm
A	I would never buy
B	with them
A	sweets but
B	no
A	I do like the kids' sweets
B	mm
A	like if they've got them I always ask for one and they give them to me
B	yes same with me and
A	but I wouldn't buy them but I do like them
B	but you think to yourself well if I can't have an chocolate you you can you do think well I'll buy a nice fruit cake or I'll buy a nice cake
A	mm
B	so long as there's no chocolate involved
A	mm
B	having said that I whizzed to the Co-op this morning cos my dad was coming down at eleven for coffee
A	oh so you've just really just really just literally sat around having coffee and chatting all day
B	I've had my nails done dad came at eleven I went to
A	goodness me
B	came back you arrived I
A	it's the life of Riley for you
B	I tell you I tell you it's all gonna happen tomorrow the housework
A	oh
B	beds everything's gotta
A	mm
B	happen tomorrow
A	yeah
B	cos I was going for my nails tomorrow morning but I noticed on Sunday that on this finger here it had lifted just
A	oh
B	in the corner and it had bubbled
A	oh
B	and I was I was standing there last night going
A	picking it?
B	picking it
A	oh that's fatal you shouldn't start picking at it
B	and then it pulled so I had this massive gap which wasn't a problem because I'd got the police because of my thumb
A	mm
B	got some treatment on that and I'm gonna put that on till later before I go to athletics it's getting there the splits are coming out
A	mm
B	well the one is the accidental one where I opened the drawer that the one that was there before I don't know we've got to see what happens but that split's gone
A	oh good good
B	yeah but there's a little bit of a weakness in the nail area
A	mm
B	just there but over time that might
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
B	doesn't matter I filled it in with polish I can wait till Wednesday morning but I just thought I'd ask on the off chance she said yeah come round at nine
A	oh that was handy
B	so so then now that leaves me a free day tomorrow with the exception of lunch duty to do as well
A	oh are you on lunch duty as well?
B	cos my plan was I was gonna do sort of either downstairs or upstairs today and then the opposite tomorrow
A	mm
B	and now I've got to do it all tomorrow
A	do you want to come and do mine?
A	can you fit that in tomorrow too?
B	easy-peasy
A	you could like do yours in the morning go to lunch duty do mine in the afternoon
B	yours in the afternoon
A	go on
B	do you reckon I could?
A	oh
B	your house is too big now
A	I know it is too big to do it in one go
B	it's big
A	it's a pain
B	you was you were saying about
A	I get I just miss rooms out
B	yeah I think I did that one last week
A	yeah I do
B	do that one next week
A	like I don't clean in the playroom I haven't cleaned in
B	yeah
A	er just like
B	no you don't use that
A	I just miss rooms out
B	well that's the way to do it going back to your spare bedroom you know how you say I know you have just decorated so this is probably not a very good time
A	which the spare bedroom?
B	to talk about
A	oh yes yeah
B	you have just
A	mm
B	why don't you just take down the partition wall to your spare bedroom and make
A	no
B	and the reduce the size of the
A	that boy gets nothing
B	or give
A	don't you start he keeps asking for it and the
B	well why not?
A	we keep telling
B	but it wouldn't look as bad because it's a larger space
A	it would why do you think he needs a doo oh
B	because you've got this beautiful spare bedroom of a really good size
A	I know
B	that you could either just a little bit off even if it's enough for a wardrobe space you could just move your partition wall
A	he's got he's got a big wardrobe now he's got his Ikea he's got quite a he's got a triple
B	I know but you have said in the past
A	and he won't hang stuff up in it
B	he's got a small bedroom
A	I know he has
B	you've got that spare bedroom next door sitting empty more often than not
B	does he?
A	it's at at the minute he's got all his ski clothes out on it
B	oh
A	Monday to Friday it's where he plonks his you know if he's away
B	mm
A	overnight bag that's constantly being filled and
B	unfilled
A	emptied and so he's he's
B	yeah it's the disadvantage isn't it of working away
A	it is really he does treat it like a dressing room at the moment it's just covered in his stuff and
B	done yeah you've done his bed
A	but
B	yeah
A	all I've asked him to do is put them away I went in this morning they're in a heap on the floor crumpled
B	oh you're joking?
A	so when he gets home tonight he is gonna get a bit of a talking to he drives me insane
B	I do get cross I must admit with ironing
A	cos yesterday morning he got up and he had no school shirts I said I thought you had loads but actually I washed and ironed four yesterday so he ended up going to school in luckily when
B	white
A	and so he went to school in
A	so I don't know how that happened anyway all four of them
A	have got paint on I said what what do you do
B	paint? that's reception
A	exactly I said what do you do? you're in year nine and all your shirts are covered in paint yeah he'll go yeah I must just go
A	I'm not quite sure he did used to have five anyway
B	oh
A	and
B	erm what's her name's probably got it
A	yeah and they're in a heap on the floor crumpled up and I'd ironed them
B	I must admit that
A	makes me livid
B	that does annoy me it does annoy me erm it's
A	is that is that your phone?
B	answerphone
A	oh
B	can you grab them?
B	somebody's put it down anyway oh that's
A	oh gone
B	gone let me just erm get my mobile not that it's gonna be school unless it's
A	oh is there something on this afternoon?
B	don't know
A	that's not a local number
B	oh I think that's Avon
A	oh is it?
B	it'll just be Avon
A	oh okay
B	oh we've got a special
A	oh do they?
B	and I say to them every time
A	I'm not interested
B	I don't do your specials thank you no it's only Avon
A	no so no he's not getting a bigger room cos he's too slovenly
B	yeah so it's
A	mm
B	she's always got an excuse
A	mm
A	yes
B	and then when I if I take ironing up or
A	I know
B	for it to sit there and get creased
A	well at least it was still in its
B	shush
A	doesn't make his bed
B	no
A	doesn't open his curtains he just it's just a pigsty
B	shush
A	and he promised us when we redecorated it for him that he'd look after it and he doesn't
B	and he hasn't
B	yeah
A	you can't really see it as you walk along he'd literally just pulled the quilt back shoved everything in that corner at the top the like where his pillow is and pulled the quilt over all his clothes
A	so he'd literally just lifted them from the floor
A	and put them in his bed
B	well why why would he do that?
A	so from
B	cos he's gotta move it before he goes to bed
A	I know
B	it looked
A	it looked like it was clear and he'd shoved them where I
B	oh
A	in the bed
B	dear me
A	I said oi
B	doesn't he?
A	no
B	office
A	upstairs or
B	oh to yeah
A	specifically to do his schoolwork on and he's got all those drawers and he it's just full of junk it's clothes mostly that he won't put away
B	you need to you need to erm
A	yeah we do really
B	soon get the yeah just no Iphone for a week
A	I have taken his phone off him actually while I've erm made him cos he gets distracted by it you know he'll go up to do it and he'll just be on his phone so I do make him give his phone up and I say right you go up there and you sort that room out
B	yeah I was gonna say yeah if you have yeah
A	and you can have it back when you've sorted it
B	when you've sorted it out
A	but the very next day it's in a mess again
B	mm
A	I get fed up
B	you get up fed up telling
A	I get fed up I just shut the door and don't no I'm not gonna go in
B	it's like
A	oh really?
B	less than a week
A	and that's really hard to get out
B	yeah but
A	it doesn't really come out does it?
B	do you know do you know what response I got? well it's my bedroom
B	I said how dare you
A	and you've just dropped it
B	I said and that's you know
A	is it foundation or something or powder?
B	no it was a bit of erm er
A	yeah
B	type of attitude it was well it's my bedroom I've got to live with it type thing you know and I said that's not the point
A	no
B	I said where's the respect for me and your dad? we've you know worked hard
A	yeah yeah
B	to get that money for you to have a nice bedroom I said and if you can't be careful and in less than a week you've got makeup on the floor it's not on

B	we'll give it a bit of a rub yeah it's erm what is it? them bronze and pearls powder stuff
A	oh okay
B	so
A	cos I know I've dropped stuff on my
B	oh I know
A	well I'd er well before we before we moved before we had the extension and now I put my makeup on in the in the en suite and it's not an issue but I know
B	yeah
A	often the sink's a mess cos you do drop it it's the
B	yeah yeah
A	but I did in the carpet
B	yeah
A	in in the spare bedroom and it is
B	I said to her I said what you need to do I said I know it's a hassle but if you want a nice bedroom because it will not be replaced
A	no
B	erm and then I get well I'll just put a rug down she's not an answer for everything
A	oh
B	oh where did that come from?
A	it's just annoying
B	an answer for everything I was a bit like that though I think
A	were you?
B	yeah
A	at that age?
B	yeah I was bit
A	mm
B	you know I thought I knew it all type thing
A	mm mm
B	erm and er I said you either need to to put like I'll I said I'll get you like a sheet or something that's specifically and you put that down on your carpet when you're doing all your makeup
A	where does she do it? at
B	at the dressing table well I said instead of sitting here and going like this
A	mm
B	you need to be actually over your dressing table
A	the dressing table yeah yeah
B	you know and
A	it's the sort of thing she'll learn when she's paid for the carpet herself
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but yeah it is it is frustrating
B	it is annoying and I know it does happen it happened to me when I was but you know when when it's hard
A	but like you say if it's only a week old
B	to come by
A	it's really annoying
B	it is really annoying and then you know instead of her going oh my god and feeling all remorseful and
A	remorseful yeah that's it
B	you know
A	if she felt sorry I mean accidents happen
B	yeah
A	if she if she showed a bit of
B	and if she'd have yeah but rather than
A	mm

B	uni?
A	hasn't hasn't thought about it he does not know
B	they do say A levels are harder that uni but you would be able to answer that so I think he would be okay at university
A	I think if you
B	if he wanted the lifestyle
A	I think if you can do if you can do A levels you can do a degree personally I think you can
B	mm
A	to be honest with you I'm sort of holding my breath to see if he can do A levels
B	oh
A	he came in today after his exam and he sat down and he said
B	but you said he hasn't put no work in so how can he expect
A	he hasn't put enough in he hasn't put enough in he has done some
B	he's done some
A	but he doesn't done as much as I would have liked
B	you don't think he's
A	no I don't
B	yeah
A	but he has done some but it was just you know he's I forget what he was saying oh he had to do this or this was I said if this is just the talk to prepare me

A	anyway we will see so to be honest with you
B	no
A	or Ds even really I want Cs and I've told him that he's not to have wasted two years but we will see
B	he won't he won't at the end of the day he can only try his best can't he but what's frustrating
A	well yes but he's not trying his best
B	no yes that's what's frustrating it's like you know this is what
A	to sink in mm
B	er where somebody else could read it once and I'm going well I can relate to that easily I can relate to that
A	mm mm
B	erm so whether there is
A	yeah
B	uncle
A	something possibly
B	along the way
A	yeah yeah
B	erm and but when I was at school I mean I came out Miss average I didn't take any I took CSEs but
A	right
B	but I came out average you know
A	yeah yeah
B	I didn't do GCSE er no
A	O levels
B	O levels I did er and I got sort of ones and twos twos mainly threes one but a mixture but Miss average but if it was now I wouldn't be surprised if I was in that category that
A	yeah yeah
B	I don't retain information and I have to read it three or four times
A	mm mm
B	to understand
A	then it's just down to yourself isn't it? self-discipline and how much you want to do it
B	yeah and I was too busy with sports then I just loved my sports
A	mm
B	they always used to say to every parents' evening
A	yeah
B	cos she's capable of so much more but I was happy to plod along
A	yeah
B	couldn't wait to get to the next netball lesson
A	and at the end of the day you've got to you know
B	or that's
A	and it didn't do you any harm anyway
B	no
A	when you went into the working world did it? so
B	no no I've always been employed
A	yeah
B	never been out of work
A	and I sort of think
B	mm
A	who knows what that'll be doing with that boy
B	but you know we I mean
A	mm yeah yeah
B	I don't know but sort of I can't really remember erm and I was never encouraged to go on to university I don't I don't know whether it was girls wasn't or
A	mm
B	they didn't think I was capable or I don't know my brother went but even my brother you know my brother didn't really excel until he was at college
A	well I
B	mm
A	better as
B	apparently when my brother was at primary school they spoke to my dad about putting putting into remedial classes cos he was really struggling
A	mm
B	but it was when he actually left school and went to college he went to
A	yeah
B	so whether he found his
A	so well I know it's like you
B	mm
A	it's not diagnosed as anything that they get help with and then people work out how to get round it themselves and then eventually get better it's like
B	it's like my brother he's got that many degrees now
A	yeah
B	under his belt you know and he's got four or five different degrees now and
A	mm
B	yeah? I mean he's you know he's like er writing programmes for banks and everything he's
A	yeah
B	you know
A	but I don't know
B	but
A	so I don't really know
B	I don't know
A	you can't and they've got to want to do it themselves anyway and as we know
B	no
A	doesn't
B	does
A	he's gone a little bit off
B	more studious?
A	yes he is but he's gone a little bit off the boil in year nine he's got this typical year nine attitude of subjects that he knows he definitely doesn't want to take
B	oh yeah
A	there's zero effort going into
B	yeah
A	erm he's very
B	mm
A	he spends so much time on his phone he is he is definitely we need to keep an eye on him at the moment but he's definitely in that year nine mentality of
B	mm yeah
A	no this year's not that important
B	oh
A	and I know where they're coming from cos I think half the time they they pick on er pick up on that at school cos they're the ones
B	yeah
A	that get the supply teachers and
B	I know
A	they're the ones that get the you know and anyway so subjects that he knows he doesn't want to do like D and T and art and music he's really lackadaisical and then it's really hard to to get them to do it cos no it doesn't mean anything if you're definitely not
B	no
A	gonna take that as an option
B	I know
A	but the
B	and what what makes me laugh is like when they've done when
A	I know I know
B	just with even the briefest of briefest introductions
A	I know
B	why carry on with French for example with
A	oh I know
B	it's ridiculous
A	it's too much timetabling isn't it?
B	well this is what I said to
A	mm mm
B	massive job and the thing is is although yes everybody's chosen their subjects they may still actually up to the deadline
A	oh
B	change
A	I don't
B	you know
A	and also I suppose they're obliged by the curriculum to have a basic
B	well it will just oh yeah
A	education to a certain level in all these subjects I suppose I don't know but I do know what you mean but
B	mm
A	cos I keep saying to him you know you've got to you've gotta buck up your ideas a bit
B	mm
A	cos I mean he was doing very well for effort but the last report I think he was slid to about sixty-three in the year whereas before he was like twelve or something
B	mm
A	so that's what happens when you get a girlfriend and you're just chatting in lessons and in science that's that's what he that's where he sits with her that's where he met her cos
B	mm
A	he went down a group at the end of last year
B	oh
A	in the end of the year test and he did say to me I'm not actually very good at science mum I don't know why I'm in set one anyway at the end of the year they said oh he needed to go down a group and
B	oh right is she is she pretty? what does she look like?
A	she's not as pretty as
B	no
A	actually and she's got quite a lot of acne bless her it's a shame
B	yeah
A	has she? but but
B	she can that's why
A	she's nice
B	foundation and that's why I allow her to with at the school
A	oh yeah
B	because it's
A	oh definitely
B	just like covering up her spots
A	mm
B	but she can be
A	yeah no so she does but she she she was very nice but no
B	yeah so is she blonde again or dark or
A	well
B	oh I thought
A	yeah
A	no
B	oh
A	had long dark hair
B	oh
A	she was very pretty and did I tell you you know when we went to the the school concert in the cathedral before Christmas?
B	yeah
A	the carol concert did I tell you
B	no
A	she was what did she she was singing she's got a lovely voice
B	yeah
A	yeah mm cos I
B	mm
A	very good
B	bless her
A	but anyway
B	so what what does she look she's fairer? long hair again?
A	long hair yes long hair again
B	tall or
A	er no not really
B	no
A	not as tall as how tall is she? she's probably only my height smaller that
A	mm
B	he's going to be very tall
A	he is he is but yeah is it raining?
B	it is
A	I walked
B	I can drop you
A	no I bought my hat
B	oh
A	in case it rained because I thought it was too windy for an umbrella
B	well they did forecast potentially five centimetres of rain today didn't they?
A	did they?
B	in some areas I think
A	oh gosh
B	yeah
A	oh the snowstorm
B	we're having rain rather than snow
A	oh
B	I didn't really see much of that I did hear a couple of snippets about it but it's quite horrific wasn't it the snow in America?
A	it yeah yeah there are quite a few people have died haven't they?
B	oh yeah I heard that
A	yeah I know
B	somebody couple of people wasn't it even just shovelling the snow out the way
A	just shovelling snow yeah yeah
B	they obviously wasn't fit to start with
A	yes
B	they were exerting their bodies and
A	why were they doing it? well it could have been the cold who knows?
B	well yeah yeah they did say erm some people have died because of the cold
A	mm
B	extreme cos it got what did it get to four minus four was it or something?
A	oh was it?
B	degrees or
A	that's not that cold is it? minus four
B	no
A	when it was cold was it last week when it was really cold here? freezing and I spoke to my mother on the Facetime and she said oh it's thirty degrees here it's a bit too hot to be honest I said mm get you
B	yeah
A	been blinking freezing over here this week
B	well last Tuesday I was working outside
B	on
A	gosh
B	and my body was warm it's my feet
A	feet and hands I bet
B	my hands were fine I'd got thick gloves on erm and I'd got two pairs of socks on
A	mm
B	I mean I have gone up to as many as three but really
A	I find once my feet are cold it doesn't matter how many pairs of socks on they they've got I need to move
B	I wasn't there very long
A	I need to
B	before they started to get really
A	really?
B	less than an hour
A	oh gosh
B	and I'd planned to be there for four
B	cos I was doing a six-hour day
A	oh no
B	cos oh yeah I was gonna say to you erm wasn't I? erm what was I gonna say to you? I was gonna say something to you
A	oh yes yeah
B	actually it's working out okay
A	oh good
B	because what I do now where I was always used to do my admin on a Monday morning and sometimes even I'd do I'd make a start on it at trampolining while
A	yeah
B	the three and a half days
A	yeah
B	what I do now is
A	mm
B	it was my turn to pick up from
A	right
B	erm
A	to where?
A	oh oh okay yeah
B	so I got home at nine so that was like a
A	yes
B	nine and a half hour day
A	wow
B	so that's that's good one that was a lot of hours
A	do you stand up that whole time?
B	yeah yeah
A	do you not ache? does your back not not ache?
B	erm not so much ache but what I find is that as the day goes on
A	mm mm
B	and you're bending up and down and you're putting your stand up and all the rest of it but as the days go as the day goes on if I drop something I can't just bend and pick it up
A	oh okay
B	cos your back kind of like goes stiff
A	cos your
B	yeah
A	the football you know
B	yeah
A	takes tea for half time and at the end you know if I go to bend down to pick up his
B	yeah you can't can you?
A	it really hurts
B	yeah yeah so
A	so which is why I'm thinking how
B	I can't say it
A	do you stand all day?
B	er erm like my legs don't ache
A	no
B	like nothing aches
A	but you can't bend
B	but it's if you go
A	yes
B	if you go to pick something up like if you drop your pen or something and and and now I have to really think about it
A	mm
B	because
A	why is that?
B	your whole
A	is that just old age?
A	I think it's cos it's too I always assume it's
B	whatever
A	cos I'm cold at the football I don't know
B	mm
A	but oh I'm glad I'm not the only one
B	yeah but no even in warm
A	yeah oh okay
B	in school you know when it's warm so so Monday is kind of becoming a work day
A	mm
B	and then I'm doing two more days
A	right
B	so for example this week I worked yesterday I'm working Thursday again at
A	mm
B	so I'll make I'll leave at eight and won't come home till say six
A	gosh
B	it'll be
A	yeah
B	a long day erm and then Friday I'm out with
A	mm
B	what I do is I calculate how many hours I've done
A	yeah
B	cos I've been doing a couple of hours admin so I'm like research new business stuff say I might do that tomorrow morning
A	mm
B	you know tomorrow afternoon erm so I calculate how many hours I've done see how many hours I've got left to do on say Friday as an example
A	mm
B	cos I've not worked a weekend this month so then I'll I'll do whatever hours out and about that I have to allowing two hours at home
A	for the admin
B	to do all my paperwork
A	okay
B	so like last week I went out at half eight I've gotta do seven hours I went out at half
A	oh okay
B	all my paperwork's done
A	so that's working out well then yeah
B	in the bag ready for money morning weekend off
A	mm
B	much better
A	oh good
B	rather than doing a full day on a Friday
A	yeah and then still having to do it
B	thinking oh I'll make a start at
A	yeah
B	or thinking oh I've gotta do all my paperwork Monday morning
A	mm
B	it's so much better
A	oh good
B	so much better
A	yeah so you're not working weekends at the moment if you
B	I haven't worked a weekend for the money of January because I've not been able to I haven't had a
A	mm
B	like you know erm like this weekend it's
A	no no
B	getting off to
A	who's
A	oh okay
A	oh wow
B	oh it was fabulous
A	where at?
B	erm it was at like a sports club in
A	oh okay
B	erm a fabulous absolutely fabulous it was it wasn't a very big room which was unfortunate because there wasn't adequate seating
A	oh
B	so people were standing up sort of
A	was that to encourage the dancing?
B	where you would dance
A	oh right
B	but you know what it's like at any of these things nobody really dances till
A	no
B	after the buffet do they? erm so we did have a bit of a boogie like you know but erm oh
A	but did all four of you go?
B	yeah all four of us
A	yeah

B	it's quite expensive so she text back
A	yeah
B	up to
A	oh really?
B	it was fabulous yeah it was fabulous

A	yeah
B	white shirt and a dicky bow
A	yeah
B	and then erm me and
A	just put the
B	head pieces
A	the
B	and some long jewellery
A	that's what's
B	bits so it
A	yeah
B	wouldn't have had to cost
A	no no
B	but I'd I suppose I didn't think about it enough I just thought hire costume hire shops
A	yeah
B	four outfits
A	yeah yeah but like you say
B	sixty odd quid probably
A	you could have maybe er adapted it
B	seventy quid
A	yeah
B	so I was quite you know I did feel a bit sad that we hadn't made the effort really because so many people had
A	yeah
B	oh and there was this one man there with his like what are they called? boater?
A	yeah
A	yeah the the
B	straw type hats?
A	yes
B	and his striped erm swimming costume

A	and did they have a band?
B	no it was a DJ
A	DJ
B	just a DJ
A	was it good?
B	cos I did wonder where they'd have a band
A	mm mm
B	he was very good actually he catered for you know all ages cos there as like obviously
A	right so they had the whole
B	going right to her grandson

B	me pops and
A	he's always been the same
A	normal sized
B	normal sized
A	yeah

A	I tell you what
B	I think
A	for such a he never puts on
A	any weight and he eats he's always been the same he absolutely can eat masses
B	I dunno where he puts it
A	but his whole family's like that his mum and dad and his sister and his brother as well they're all I mean his sister she's got a really healthy appetite but there's nothing on her
B	it's not fair is it?
A	it's not fair his parents are the same I mean they're like sticks but they don't actually eat that much now but
B	he was going over to see them yesterday
A	they must just have high metabolisms
B	metabolism
A	they must have
B	our brother's like that we had the wrong
A	mm

A	mm
B	and he can eat for England and doesn't put any weight on
A	it's
B	I look
A	and it's so annoying
B	and I put weight on before I've even eaten
A	whereas you see I think
B	she doesn't

A	she goes to bed at nine o'clock most nights
B	when we erm when we when we was off Christmas holiday I can honestly say it it was by the end of the first week and we wasn't really waking up to an alarm so I was waking up any time
A	mm
B	between eight and ten
A	really?
B	if I'd had a late night the night before you know out or dad down here or whatever but it wasn't until the end of the first week of the holiday that I woke up and actually woke up and thought oh it's morning
A	feeling ready to go?
B	yeah
A	you often get that this time of year though don't you?
B	oh
A	you get that
B	I think what it is is obviously you do your work in the day like you say I'm standing
A	mm
B	for like you know
A	hours on end it's tiring
B	anything that it is tiring cos you're standing still as well
A	yeah yeah
B	but the the the chitchat with the people doesn't
A	yes yeah
B	which is tiring erm but when you come home and you've had your evening
A	oh
B	it's like last night was dropping her up and picking her back up so you can't come home and have a shower and jimjams on and think so you think oh well just potter about or I'll quickly do this or quickly do that
A	you do stuff yeah
B	and you're back out
A	you do stuff
B	tonight'll be athletics so we're out at half six back home for nine by the time we have a shower
A	mm

A	oh good good
B	but erm so I think it's not like you come home you have your evening meal and you think and you relax
A	no you haven't got that yeah
B	because you're either thinking I've got to drop her out in a minute and I've gotta go back and pick her up
A	see you'll miss all that
B	and then
A	when they've left home
B	I know
A	no you won't
B	that's what I keep telling myself
A	you won't you'll think oh this is nice
B	oh I'll be I'll be like you know oh what shall I do it's boring
A	really? no
B	I don't know what do you think?
A	oh I think I'll get used to it
B	I think I'll be glad to sit down and put our feet up
A	yes and not think oh it's raining it's cold I've got to go out and pick them up yes it can be so nice
B	do you think?
A	not to have to do that
B	do you then we'll be like oh the weeks are so long?
A	no
B	do you know that's another reason why I think time goes faster as you get older because where we're at a stage now for example our
A	mm
B	or you're thinking where are they and you don't settle till they've come home whatever I think maybe life goes faster as you get older because those seven nights a week when you're at home and you haven't got to do all that could be pretty boring couldn't they?
A	no that would make it go slower not faster
B	no but that's why time goes faster so it doesn't seem like
A	oh I
B	it's just you know you
A	I don't know
B	that's when you start finding all these hobbies
A	mm
B	and new interests isn't it?
A	yes something to look forward to
B	I would just really really really really like to not feel tired
B	I would just really
A	like to not
B	like to not I permanently feel tired
A	do you?
B	I woke up yesterday morning and I got up and by the time I'd emptied the dishwasher had a couple of pieces of toast with a cup of tea went upstairs to get washed and dressed and all the rest of it I was even like brushing my teeth leaning on the sink because I felt so tired
A	you've had too many nights out you need to stop going out every weekend
B	I feel like it all the time
A	do you?
B	yeah it's horrible horrible I feel tired all the time sometimes I feel so tired it's a strain to
A	really?
B	to hold my eyes open yeah honestly I have done for a long time
A	do you think you should go and see the doctor?
B	no because I've mentioned it to the doctor before
A	and what have they said?
B	cos I said oh do you think my thyroid's playing up? I'm so tired I I wake up in the morning and sometimes I can get to the bottom of the stairs and my legs are so heavy
A	oh really?
B	I feel I can wake up and my legs are like lead weights in the bed I feel like I've been climbing
A	well I I've experienced that but that's when I've
B	Mount Everest
A	been to the gym and worked to hard
B	yeah no this is you know
A	oh really? and what did the doctor say? no?
B	she just said it gets worse as you get older
A	oh and that was it?
B	yeah cos my thyroid was fine
A	oh that's something to look forward to then
B	I know I can't
A	really?
B	remember the last time I felt like I've got energy and enthusiasm to do anything because constantly everything I do is kind of like a battle
A	oh god
B	not a battle that's probably extreme erm
A	an effort
B	an effort
A	really?
B	oh yeah yeah
A	so
B	no
A	looking at
B	yeah
A	getting
B	said it get it gets worse as you get
A	you're not that old though
B	I know that's what I said to her
A	you're only fifty you're not that old
B	I said to her I said but I feel like I feel like I feel like completely washed out
A	really?
B	yeah all the time
A	oh you see I don't no
B	see like I'm sitting here talking to you like and even like my arms feel heavy
A	oh really?
B	yeah they just feel I just feel like I'm sort of my eyes feel tired
A	mm
B	I feel like I could sit here close my eyes and go out like that
A	really?
B	and then like I don't like like I've got to go and cook no
A	oh
B	no no no you can she just can't
A	cook
B	and like it's all like
A	oh
B	I haven't even got the energy to go and put the meal on the table
A	so doing that really?
B	oh god yeah
A	oh
B	I know it's not right is it?
A	no I don't think that's right not
B	I don't think it's right
A	not at only fifty maybe
B	no
A	if you were seventy you'd expect to be tired
B	yeah
A	but not at this age no
B	even like taking her out for a walk
A	well you've got two children to do that
B	even before I start you know like well when you're not here
A	mm
B	before I even go for the walk it's like
A	so how do you manage when you get to the gym then?
B	well I don't work like I used to
B	I just like
A	it's not meant to be a bit of a jolly
