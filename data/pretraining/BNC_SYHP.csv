A	tablet case or
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	phone case but still be able to prop it up my
B	yes
A	and my current tablet's in a huge great case which has a a swirly so that I can I can do it landscape or portrait
B	yes
A	cos I watch videos read through the
B	mm mm
A	but the the the case is it it's huge and annoying and heavy and it makes it more difficult to carry the tablet around and kind of defeats the object of it being small and light
B	well exactly
A	erm
B	mm
A	but if you want a
B	mm
A	it just doesn't work
C	mm
A	so
C	so that's how you get round that problem
A	yes
C	fantastic idea
A	it and
C	cos er I find that so annoying myself
B	I love this stuff
C	as well I I
A	you can sit
C	yeah you can sit it up like that
B	sit with your Kindle
C	yeah
D	oh oh
C	that's that's lovely
D	oh
A	and it's just
D	so why didn't you tell me
C	yeah
D	about one of these? my eyes my hands go
C	because I'm always doing this
B	thought of you see
C	oh
D	well thank you darling
B	she she brought two of them
D	ah
B	there you go
B	that's right
A	you see I was waiting for it
C	well
B	well why didn't I think of
B	cos I I love it because it's so simple isn't it?
D	mm
A	yes it's
B	just
A	it's it's really nice I've seen some others but the the the thing I really liked about that one is because it's erm er the er the bits are aluminium
C	yeah
B	yes
A	so it's got a little bit more
C	that's that's right
A	robust
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah rather than the their brittle plastic stuff
A	yeah I mean it's plastic round the edges but it's
B	what's er what's the brand? night
A	Nite Ize
B	Nite Ize Nite Ize
A	they predominantly do erm hiking gear so
C	oh right
A	torches and
C	do they?
A	er erm erm erm just random stuff things like erm carabiners for putting your keys on
C	oh yeah
B	yeah okay
C	yeah yeah
A	so I I mean I use them I I I've bought them bought all sorts of stuff from them
C	yeah
A	prior to this
B	then you just
A	but I happened to see that and went
C	that's brilliant
A	that's what I need I need that
C	yeah
A	erm
B	brilliant
A	and I I could find them and they were all er ten pounds a shot and it was like oh mm and I can't get them out here easily and all of that
C	yeah
A	and I happened to er go and look erm and Blacks had a sale on and they were a fiver
C	oh wow
A	and I went
C	so you got
A	I'll get two
B	there you go
B	so if we go to Blacks if
C	but the so
B	see if we can find mm
C	that's good to know
B	mm
C	I might order some and get some when I go over to England
A	yeah they
B	for sure
B	yeah
C	that place
A	truly amazingly good thing and
C	yeah
A	I'm I'm really pleased with it because yeah just occasionally you wanna sit on a and and you've got
C	you do
A	you've got a table and you've got a drink and
C	yeah
A	you you don't want to have another hand
B	you don't want to
C	yeah
B	use your other hand
A	yeah
B	that's a common problem isn't it?
A	and
B	yeah
A	the thing I found erm
C	yeah
A	the tablet because
C	okay
A	because it's easier than
B	mm
A	PDFs are a pain in the neck
C	yeah
A	erm and there I am with my laptop and I've got a book or three
C	yeah
A	erm
C	I know what you mean like when you're studying or something
A	yeah absolutely
C	yeah
A	I mean I
C	yeah
A	I spent
C	yeah
A	the the whole of last year writing a blooming dissertation
C	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	so you you you end up under just piles of paper and
C	yeah
A	what you want is the
C	yeah
A	next to your monitor otherwise it's just gonna get lost
A	so yes
C	I reckon you could probably lie in bed and just sort of about you know rest it there
D	yeah
A	well
D	yeah
A	I could if I have to
C	you know you could have your little cup of
A	come and sit there
C	there you go
B	there you go
C	though you could have your cup of cocoa and you would have one hand free cos I find
D	yes
C	when I'm reading in bed with the Ipad er and then it starts going
D	and then yeah and then you have to
D	turn the page and you er
C	and it
A	yeah
C	should is there a way of stopping it from doing that? you know if you're lying down and you you go to get some water
A	and it
C	and you go that way and go
A	it doesn't automatic erm
C	it doesn't
A	depending on which app you're using erm
C	Kindle
A	if you're using the Kindle app for Android erm when you hold it er you'll find there's a little lock icon that appears in the corner if you
C	oh
A	hit that it will lock it to whichever orientation you are currently using
C	oh brilliant
B	you can do it erm the same on your Ipad
A	erm
B	and you just have to go on the settings
A	yeah I imagine
C	okay
A	the Kindle app
C	yeah
A	for
C	yeah
B	and just
C	but erm
B	you need to go to settings
A	yeah
C	okay
A	erm it's
C	that's it
A	erm yes absolutely
C	yeah
A	and there is also there there should also be a a a mm a a an option somewhere in the menu that will allow you to do that for the whole thing so
C	okay
A	it doesn't auto rotate at all
C	yeah yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	erm which can be useful if
A	and it's just moving
A	yes
C	and it's like
A	absolutely
C	excellent
A	so yes
C	right let me just check this is recording okay erm
D	which country has most influenced my language? or or oh I get
A	Britain
D	well yes that's
B	how many years have you lived in Britain?
D	erm
A	many
D	erm
B	half your life?
D	fifty
B	yeah
D	fifty years
B	okay
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	the second half
D	yeah well er less than if you take out the the years I've lived here
C	yeah
B	yes
C	yeah
D	because
C	fifty years
D	I moved there
C	yeah
D	when I was eighteen
C	yeah yeah
D	mm
B	the so
D	so
C	yeah so
D	I moved there
C	it's a big big influence
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	the most yeah
C	yeah massive
D	but they do say that the the the the the most formative years of your speech and language development and the accents you adopt is to five years
B	mm
D	or seven
A	seven
C	is
D	seven
C	is that? oh
A	yes
D	yes
A	you form most of your vowel sounds by the time you're seven
D	yeah
A	erm and particularly for men they never lose them
D	yes
A	women because they if they move into different communities will speak more with people outside their community
C	right
A	erm will often lose their
C	yes
A	and only pick them up
C	that's what's happened to me yeah
A	yes
D	yes
C	my vowel sounds
D	well women
C	that Australian accent
D	women tend to be copycats anyway
C	yes
D	so you
A	yes
D	imitate they they imitate
A	and
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	absolutely and erm so because it's it's all it's predominantly about vowel sounds
C	right yeah yeah yeah
A	to get the accent
C	yeah
A	erm you you find that er women will will blend in
C	mm
A	whereas men will will stay
C	will stand out
A	stand out much longer
C	yeah
A	certainly
C	yeah yeah
A	erm
C	that's interesting
A	it is
C	yeah
A	isn't it? I mean
C	yeah
A	and of course it's it's also the there's a very the the gender is predominantly because men will be with one particular community because they'll go to work
C	mm
A	whereas women will have to be will generally
C	yeah
A	because they're going into the community they're doing shopping
C	shopping
A	they're looking after kids
C	childcare
A	they're doing
C	yeah that's it
A	all of that
C	yeah yeah
A	and so I think er it'll be interesting to see as those roles change whether that changes the way that
C	true with men
A	erm with people accents
C	if those males' vowels will change
A	yeah
C	or whether they can imitate yeah that's interesting
A	so yes
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	wow
A	so you've just hit another one of these random little things that I have a small
B	and you just
A	amount of
A	knowledge about
B	I know yeah it's
C	no that's great that's great
B	that you picked up tonight
C	because I mean I
D	I I often say to her is there anything you don't know
D	anything about?
D	ah because you will answer or somebody will say something and she can come out with this and I'm thinking oh my god
D	yes right okay
A	it's one of the things about being a geek
A	you go you you're you're passionate about stuff
A	and so anything that that remotely tickles your interest you'll go and read about
C	yeah yeah
D	mm
B	mm
A	and
C	yeah exactly
A	we tend to also have good retention
C	yeah
A	so that yes when people
C	yeah
A	then mention
C	to see
A	it
C	for you to remember
A	you can you can blurt
A	all kinds of stuff
C	blurt and splurt
D	yeah
A	one of the things I very much have to do is is actually concentrate and make sure that when I start I I'm I'm I I I make sure that people are going mm
A	because
D	yeah
A	they don't always notice the social cues of people saying shut up shut up you're going on
A	oh okay yes sorry
D	yeah
B	you know we were talking about brevity before?
D	yes
A	yes
A	yes
A	I can do brevity when telling a story but
D	yes
A	but as soon as get onto something I'm I'm
C	so
B	excited about
D	yeah
B	yeah right
B	I'll tell you the whole thing of everything I know about it
B	fantastic
D	right nationality
A	oh god that's complicated isn't it?
D	yeah I always get mixed up with that
B	do you have a British passport?
D	yes
C	put that down
B	British
C	yeah
B	British right
C	yeah
A	yes but we also have a second nationality
D	yeah
B	well I I do too
C	yeah
B	I mean I I'm
B	I'm British and I'm Kiwi
C	yeah
B	so I it's
D	oh ah right okay
C	it's a British passport so
B	you know
D	okay well I'm gonna put British and I'll decide really
A	I mean I I I've not got
B	my dad was born in
D	okay
B	England so
D	ah so you are British?
C	yeah he calls himself Kiwi really though
D	oh does he?
B	cos I was born in
B	New Zealand
D	ah
C	born and brought up there
B	I grew up there
D	yeah yeah
C	education
D	yeah
C	accent
D	yeah
C	mother like er
D	the thing is erm
C	New Zealand
D	er so much of
C	right
D	it always falls back to the male
C	okay
D	erm it's for example er it was when I was working with erm
C	yeah
D	you discover little differences that mark them out
C	right
D	and I can't remember which particular erm
C	right
D	in terms of ethnicity
B	mm
D	and whatever erm and you're thinking well you're married to each other why aren't you Mrs?
C	yeah
D	and then but because like
C	yeah
D	I would say oh mm so they will tell me erm oh when a woman gets married she keeps her father's name
C	right
D	she doesn't change to her husband's name
C	interesting
D	which is
C	yeah
D	really really interesting
C	yeah yeah
D	so you have all these Mrs Cors when
C	yeah
D	their
C	yes
D	or whatever
C	yeah yeah yeah there's something like that in Vietnam I remember we asked quite a lots of
B	mm
C	questions
D	yeah
C	when we were travelling in Vietnam and there was something really specific about that
D	yeah
C	that it's actually up a paternal line
D	that's right
C	that er
D	yeah
C	they're interested in keeping that
D	yeah
C	sort of thread alive
D	mm sees that Polish
C	so
D	Polish
C	yes
D	and the man remains
A	yes
A	erm you get
D	the man is
A	you you get
B	mm
A	the the the patronymic thing
D	yeah
A	erm in eastern European and and
C	yeah
A	towards
C	mm
A	Russia
C	cos our our
A	erm
C	Czech friend Czech Republic
D	yeah
C	she's
B	yes
C	and that symbolises that she keeps her father's surname but she's the
A	yes
D	yes
C	or something
B	so it's the ODA
D	yeah
C	so it it
D	yeah
B	so he's
D	yeah
B	the Mr
C	this shows that she's the
D	ah
B	and she's the daughter
D	right
D	so that's similar to Turkish where you
C	right
D	get erm the father is
C	right
D	assistant professor
C	right
D	or erm
C	ah
B	ah I see
D	his father was
B	I see I see
D	erm and he can be quite open and er er the trust
A	so yes in in Iceland where again even more recently than the Turks have taken on surnames you get erm
D	yeah
A	erm er
D	yeah
A	I think that's the their current prime minister erm
B	mm
A	and it it's very much
D	yeah yeah
A	the daughter of er
D	yeah
A	whereas when we took on erm
D	yes
A	and stuff
D	so you get
C	so yeah Carpenter
D	your name for the
A	yeah absolutely
C	Blacksmith
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and Cooper and
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	but er
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	you'll you'll get
C	that's very true
A	sorry Cooperson erm I I was the son of the Cooper but the
C	yeah that's it yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
C	it's all trades
A	it's much of less
C	and professions
A	of that
D	mm
A	but it's much more
D	yeah
A	trade and and
C	mm
A	related
D	yeah
C	mm that's so true
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah it's
A	very intriguing
B	yeah it's intriguing
C	so but your second nationality then you were saying that the first obviously erm your British passport but you had
D	it's
C	it's Trinidad
D	Tobago
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	okay
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	so and that's a why I've been
D	well it was my original nationality
C	yeah
D	and then erm really for ease of travel I decided to erm convert to a British passport but when I did that erm which I did because I was then married to my husband who was British erm
A	back in the day when it was easy to do that
C	yes exactly
B	mm
D	yeah
C	yes
D	very easy to do that
C	yeah it's almost impossible to do it now
A	very
D	yes
A	very difficult
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	erm a friend of mine had her mental health wrecked by getting it done with her erm
C	oh no
A	er British husband she's an American and trying to to become a British citizen was a complete nightmare
C	yes
A	and very expensive as well
C	very expensive
A	just to
C	and it's not guaranteed
A	no and god no
C	that you'll get it
D	really? wow and these people won't hear about not getting being you know having how many years they've been trying to get now
C	oh the
D	the British yeah
C	it it er
D	the
C	er
D	yes citizenship
C	oh
D	citizenship oh my god
C	citizenship yeah
D	but er
A	cos they have no idea what it takes to do it in the UK
D	well no because er
D	well when you want the other side
C	yeah
D	it's all was simple because you didn't have to do it
C	yeah
D	so now you're on the other side it's become complicated
C	yeah
D	and difficult
C	yeah yeah
D	and they can't understand that
C	no
D	and the the other thing because Britain owned the world er they think that Britain still own the world and I am British you know so you shouldn't be treating me like this
C	I understand now
B	yes
C	the gap
C	that for me has got less because
D	yeah
C	from living in Australia
D	yeah
C	I went in with those sets of eyes as well
D	yeah
C	thinking it might be interesting to look at er permanent residency and then from PR you secure Australian citizenship I wasn't sure about going all the way into Australian citizenship but I certainly thought
D	yeah
C	gaining PR would be
D	yeah yeah
C	useful and then of course you meet all these different people and they're trying to go to the UK to do whatever they want and then you're having these discussions about just how difficult it is both sides
D	yes
A	yeah
C	for different reasons
D	yeah
C	really hard
D	yeah
C	really expensive and no guarantees
D	yeah
C	at the end so I see that the gap really for me personally has lessened because
D	right
C	of that because I now
D	yeah
C	see even now getting this job at
B	mm
C	of course you need to get residency
D	yeah
C	of course you need a work permit
D	yeah
C	quite a accustomed to now
D	yeah yes
C	you turn up and somebody goes okay we'll have to sponsor you we now you have to fill out these forms now fill out this and
B	mm
C	pay for this
D	mm
C	pay for that but it's good he's gonna get residency through me
D	ah right
C	as well which is really helpful
D	yeah yeah
A	yes
C	you know cos then you don't have to worry so much
D	yes
A	no absolutely
D	yeah
C	about him so
D	yeah yeah
C	and he can get the social security
D	oh right yes yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	through through this
D	yeah through it through from your work yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	cos these are the things that people who never leave their country
D	absolutely
C	or even
A	and that's how
C	their town
D	absolutely
C	or village
B	they don't know all this
C	they'd never
B	mm
D	yes yes
A	for
C	mm
A	people forget what they gain from Europe
C	mm
D	entry
A	the fact that they can go and live
D	uhu
A	without
C	yeah
A	anything you go you turn up you tell the police that you're staying
C	yeah
A	two weeks after you arrive
C	yeah
A	and you can stay indefinitely
C	that's true yes
A	in any
A	in
B	EU country
C	yeah
B	yes
C	yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
C	you have to jump through
B	mm
C	a few hoops but it's
A	mm
C	guaranteed that you will be
A	yeah
C	allowed to
D	yeah
C	do it you know you have to fill out
A	unless
C	some forms
A	you are massively unpleasant
C	yeah
A	then it's unlikely that they're gonna
A	kick you
C	that's right
A	back out
C	yeah
A	again
C	unless you're like the Taliban or something
C	it's not happening
B	yeah it it's incredible how short term people's
A	yes
B	thinking is
D	yes yeah
B	erm I'm just doing this course on online at the moment through er MIT it's just one of those free
A	mm
D	yes
B	er online courses and it's erm
D	oh right
B	so it's about change
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	making and leadership and that kind of
D	yeah
B	stuff and the erm the people who run it have been researching this stuff for nearly twenty thirty years or something and they set up a particular laboratory at MIT and er masses and masses of data so they're presenting this stuff they've written their own books and they share some of their
D	uhu
B	and talks through er various cycles of experience that we repeatedly go through
A	uhu
B	so we know that you know there was a a financial crisis and back in the nineteen twenties
D	uhu
B	and thirties and stuff
D	uhu
B	and yet here we are nearly a hundred years later doing exactly the same
D	the same thing
B	thing
A	oh yes yeah
B	yeah? and he highlights many different examples of these type of situations where in society we continue to make the same mistakes and don't learn
D	yeah
B	from them
D	yes
B	not on an not on a small scale but it's when it gets to a large
D	yes yes
B	scale
A	oh yeah
D	yes
B	that's when these problems come about
D	yeah
B	that we can operate to some certain degree as a group or as a a
D	mm
B	a small team or
D	mm
B	something or even a large corporation
D	mm
B	but take it to a larger scale it fails
D	yeah
B	we just cannot
D	yeah
B	get to a
C	learn
B	point
D	yeah
B	where we learn
C	mm
B	so he erm draws out some facts and figures and he identifies that
A	yes
B	and it is the biggest in the world
A	right
B	but the concept of it's a similar
D	uhu uhu uhu
B	on in the western hemisphere kind of thing that that's the scale of it and erm I just find it interesting that he he
A	yes
D	mm
B	and to solve great problems together
A	particularly
D	uhu
B	as a community
D	uhu
A	having had two world wars
D	uhu
B	post post war
C	yeah
B	and all of this
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	kind of thing
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	which was
B	and he
A	predominantly centred in Europe
B	and he and he picks on Germany as an example probably cos he's German
D	yeah
B	and he understands the background and erm then he comes to the kind of contemporary situation where we are where Europe's still in some financial crisis and that Germany rather than having started up off with this you know all the dialogue is about a group kind of consensus
A	uhu
B	they decided that rather than Europe working out the financial crisis that each individual country would be responsible for their own financial problems
D	mm
A	yes it's
B	so they so they so they
C	yes
B	that that it was kind of like the pulled the supportive rug out from underneath everybody
A	uhu uhu
B	and said you're all gonna have to work this out individually so now we've got thirty or forty different communities trying to join together and work out what to do
D	mm
B	or not join together
D	yeah
C	mm
B	and all work in their own individual way
D	mm
B	whereas the European Union was
C	the ideology
D	yeah
B	the
C	yeah
B	ideology
C	yeah
B	was was was to look at at the bigger picture and
D	yeah
B	how can we crack this nut
C	mm
B	and move on
A	but I think it's
B	with a new way?
D	mm
C	mm
A	yeah I think it's very interesting that that's happened at this time because it highlights the fact that when there are financial crises one of the things that tends to happen is a rise in nationalism
C	true
B	yes
C	uhu
B	mm uhu
A	erm and a and a move to the right within politics
B	mm mm
C	mm mm
A	erm and what are we seeing if not a move to the right within politics?
C	yes
A	and er er
C	it's sort of
A	a fairly the major
C	off the
B	mm mm
A	well certainly within
C	sort of unprecedented
A	for European
C	yeah yeah
A	politics
C	yeah
A	the the move to the right is
C	mm
A	quite significant
C	mm
A	we're still fairly left as far as the Americans are concerned
C	yes true
A	but erm yeah I mean it it's been very interesting
C	mm
A	to watch it from er with with er an academic eye
C	yeah
A	erm
C	yeah well
A	also for to look at one's bank account and
A	go oh
D	yeah
A	but erm yeah
C	mm
A	it's er er there there's a lot of very interesting stuff going on there and and
B	mm
D	and I think
A	forums and stuff where people can actually go and and look
C	mm
A	you can
C	you can learn
A	you can er and
C	yeah
A	more people are
C	it's true
A	understanding why these things are happening
C	mm mm
A	but erm something I saw fantastically on Facebook yesterday the the the the UKIP those
C	oh yeah
A	marvellous bunch of people
A	put out an advert to remind expats
C	right
A	that they should register to vote
A	for the UKIP
C	I know
A	so these are people who have specifically taken advantage of all of the things that the UKIP would like to erm
C	yeah
A	but they should definitely vote for the UKIP because
A	and and
C	isn't it?
A	there was a there was a survey er done
C	right
D	yes well this is
A	but
D	this yeah
C	sixty percent that's high
D	yeah
A	which is great and lovely and
C	yeah
A	and
C	yeah
A	I like the fact that they accept they acknowledge something that is part of the UN human rights charter that we have the that that
C	uhu
A	unfortunately erm only thirty percent these are rough numbers of people er thought that it was a right for other people to come to the
D	to Britain
A	UK
D	yeah
D	that that that
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	which is
B	yeah
A	just
B	mm
A	that wonderful double standard of
A	I'm British and I
C	yeah
D	can do things
C	yeah
D	yes
A	but if you're not
D	yes
A	British and therefore
D	yeah
A	you can't do things
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yes
A	erm so yes I er
C	but I'd be interested to know what you think about that
D	mm
C	you know
D	yeah
C	to set your life up I guess also
D	mm
C	that what was the feeling then and how much it's changed?
D	it it er
C	you know
D	right okay
C	with the European Union
D	I
C	changing
D	when I I decided I wanted to come to the UK to study nursing erm and er so I wrote to the hospital in I I think I only wrote to that one specific hospital because I had some erm distant removed relations living in that in in
C	right
D	who I'd never met didn't know they were sort of on my my mother's paternal er my maternal erm sort of
C	okay
D	side from a different island
C	okay
D	in the Caribbean
D	and there so I wrote to this hospital cos they gave me the address and one thing and another and erm
C	right
D	but then I was called for an interview in Trinidad
C	right
D	so I went
C	cool
D	for an interview in Trinidad and I can't remember there was nobody there representing the hospital
C	right
D	it was it it is and I know this is my memory which is really flawed to be quite honest and I had this interview and er and I was accepted at the interview you didn't have to sign anything but it it was sort of taken for granted that after your three years of training you if they allowed you to go to do this training
C	right okay
D	you would return to work in the country
C	right okay
D	you didn't have to sign your life away to say
C	right
D	yes you would but
C	yeah
D	it it was sort of erm implicit
C	right
D	implicit? yes
A	yes
D	so erm time came and I heard that I'd been accepted to do my training at
C	mm
D	for themselves it wasn't erm with
A	it was some
B	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah and erm
C	uhu
D	erm she was very she actually was very erm maternalistic
C	right
D	towards her foreign students
C	okay yeah
B	mm
D	she was a really
C	that's nice
D	really I think she'd been in the war and erm
A	as so many nurses had
D	so she had a
C	yeah
D	sorry?
A	as so many nurses had
D	yes and she
B	mm
D	had she had a much broader open mind
A	uhu uhu
D	erm
C	right
D	and at the end of three my three years they called for my passport and erm when it was returned to me they said to me I now have citizenship
C	wow
D	they didn't ask me if I
C	they just
D	wanted it they didn't
C	they just gave it to you
D	they they I
C	yeah
D	was just given
C	yeah
D	citizenship the right to stay in the UK
C	oh lovely
D	as long as
C	yeah
D	I wanted
C	yeah wow
D	and I thought oh oh
D	this is nice
A	do you
D	ah yes in
B	citizenship later
A	so you got
D	yeah
A	indefinitely to stay
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm mm
B	which again
C	yeah
D	is deeply difficult to
C	it yes
B	obtain
D	yeah
C	yeah exactly
C	yeah
D	so I didn't have to from that day forward I never had to keep sending my passport to
C	mm
A	to have it or or gone wherever you went because I didn't know whether
C	yeah
D	find out
C	yeah
D	yeah and erm
C	yeah
D	erm
C	yeah
D	quite freely
C	yeah
D	so I wasn't tied to that hospital anymore erm
C	true
D	stay there and
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	it's
D	yeah
C	your sponsor
D	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	uhu
C	that's
D	erm yes that's exactly
C	yeah
D	yeah right
A	yeah which is fairly standard around the world
D	oh right okay
A	with work permits they are to or for
D	yeah
B	cos they're
A	a particular
B	attached
D	yeah
B	they're for a purpose
C	mm
D	oh right yeah
C	you have to be careful
D	yeah
C	of that
A	so it's
C	to keep
C	to try and move somewhere else
D	yes
B	mm
C	or another company or something
D	yeah so erm
B	but you you you arrived in the mid sixties when there was the influx of people from the Caribbean
C	mm
A	anyway
D	uhu
A	so erm there was obviously er an amount of of of backlash towards that that's it's something that they now teach in in in erm GCSE history courses
C	yeah
A	the backlash to the Windrush
D	yes
C	yeah
A	erm but how did you find being a black person?
D	well that wasn't what I was going to come on to say because I have said throughout my life I have never ever faced
C	mm
D	nobody has been been face to face erm treated me with any er racial you know erm whatsit so personally I have never ever funnily I go I will say this I will go back and say this the racism that I experienced was from other people from the Caribbean
C	right
D	because the Caribbean is the most racist bloody unit of islands in the world
C	is it? I didn't know that
D	absolutely
C	I did not know that
D	you mark my words and it's
A	cos they all come from different parts
D	of Africa
C	ah
A	of Africa
D	yeah
C	so there's a real pecking order
A	and all it's all very
D	yes
A	very insular
A	so there is very er yeah there's very much a pecking order amongst the islands
C	uhu
A	T and T has oil so is a much richer island
C	oh
A	than many of the others
C	right
A	and so you you get a whole bunch of things
C	ah
A	but also as you see in other erm non white communities there's the racism between
C	yeah
A	I'm very black you're not so black
D	er yes I was coming to that
C	yeah
A	erm
D	yeah
A	which has been encouraged I I read a lovely article about erm South America
C	uhu
A	the Spanish encouraged that level of racism
C	oh
A	erm that that whiter that whiter is better
C	yeah
A	from the sixteenth century
B	mm
A	when they first went over
B	mm
A	when they first started mingling with the the natives if you were a mulatto if you were whiter you you you were a
C	you were
A	a higher status
C	and if you were gonna get
A	than if you were darker
C	on better with
A	so
C	the Spanish
D	yes
C	yeah and be
A	absolutely
D	yeah
C	promoted and
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	and now that's something
C	mm
A	that the colonial powers have done wherever they've gone
C	mm
A	they've encouraged whiter is better
B	yeah well the Brits
D	yeah
B	the Brits did that in Australia
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	with
A	absolutely
C	mm
D	yes
C	mm
B	to a to a terrible extent
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	mm
D	so er among there were I mean during my er training years erm they there were people there from Jamaica people from British Ghana which is now Ghana
C	uhu
D	people from
C	uhu
D	I was there were two of us from Trinidad and Tobago but she was she'd been there before me and I think had done
C	right
D	erm so she'd sort of been through that but yes it was this business of er and that actually started I joined I came to England by erm er boat ship
B	oh wow
C	right
D	the liner
C	wow
D	and it was a French erm world cruise liner which I joined on the halfway the return voyage
C	right
D	back to Southampton so I joined it
C	yeah
B	mm
D	in Southampton
A	no you left in
D	the in sorry
C	yeah
D	on the way back to Southampton and on the way they picked up erm they stopped at various islands and they picked up passengers and the minute we picked up people from Jamaica I started to experience problems with them
C	really?
D	because Jamaica and Trinidad erm they do not erm
C	and what sort of things
B	they don't mix
C	would they say to each other?
B	mm
C	or looks would they give to to symbolise that there's a sort of racism that exists in
D	well they would call me whitey they would call me
C	oh
D	erm oh oh all sorts of names
C	yeah
D	it was a lot of erm
B	yeah
D	verbal verbal abuse really
C	negativity
D	yeah
C	okay
D	erm and erm I remember one day erm somebody went and fiddled with the shower
C	oh
B	right
D	and
C	on purpose?
D	I went to
C	yeah
C	yeah
D	oh this is gonna make me cry but
C	oh
D	and I went to have a shower and they'd fiddled with it and made the water boiling hot
C	so it scalded you?
B	oh that's horrible
A	oh
D	and I was standing in the oh my god and yeah
C	oh that's horrible
D	so yeah er so
C	mm
D	because she's never
C	right
D	so she's never experienced any of this
C	yeah
D	erm and in her own little world she's a kingpin type
C	right
D	of thing
C	okay
B	uhu
D	and she cannot understand erm the
C	yes
D	in a way
C	and the emotions that
D	I've kept
C	it hurts obviously
B	mm
D	yes
B	mm
C	yeah yeah
D	and I will say now from my very earliest days here
A	which here?
D	er er there
C	in the UK yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	all my friends
B	this was my third suitcase
D	erm the people who became my friends
C	yeah
D	or who erm adopted me as a friend were white
C	mm mm mm
D	er I would be taken to their homes
C	wow
D	erm for Sunday lunches
C	yeah
C	oh that's great to hear
D	so yeah it was
C	yeah
D	erm
C	so they welcomed you?
D	oh yes
C	and then and they helped you to settle in
D	yeah yeah
C	and find your life
D	absolutely
C	yeah there yeah
D	so er
A	but you didn't get so much that that that thing that again I read a lot of articles I have a lot of time on my hands so erm
A	the idea that you are you you are the the the representative of I'm not racist I have a black friend
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	you didn't get that
D	no
A	so much from them
D	no
A	because as as much as anything you
D	uhu
A	erm
C	yeah
A	you settled into a a that middle class white milieu without
D	mm
A	so much it
C	yeah
A	my
C	okay
A	my facial features
C	yeah
A	the fact that I I I'm basically pink
C	yeah
A	erm and so I've not had and because I I've grown up in a middle class white environment I've been socialised as white
C	yes yeah
A	so I don't have that connection to erm any of that side of my my my er my background
C	yeah
A	and so it can it it it's actually quite difficult
C	yeah
A	because
C	I can
A	I have
C	imagine it would be
A	I have no
C	confusing
A	I really do have no connection which means that
C	yeah
A	when I'm in when I'm in the Caribbean
C	yeah
A	er er like any other
C	yeah
A	white
B	mm
A	person and so I it's
B	so you would have to actively work to create that connection?
A	yeah I would
B	either with er through some
A	yeah
B	project
C	family or
B	to actually go out and meet and
A	yeah
B	talk to
D	yeah
B	people say within
D	yeah
B	the local community in
A	and at that point
B	in Britain or
A	you start being a bit sort of well
D	yeah yeah
A	I I I'm soliciting
D	yeah
A	black friends
A	that's not what I'm doing that that's
C	yeah that's absolutely
C	I'm like white racists
A	a bit icky and all
B	yeah
A	and colonial
C	I now want a black
D	yeah
C	friend
B	but there it's the kind of
C	but I'm black you know yeah
B	if you want to
B	if you want to er assimilate with a culture you need to get in with the culture and go and meet people
A	yeah
B	and things like that and it's the same thing living in a place like this that if you want to get to understand how the system works it helps to know how the locals go about it
D	yeah
A	yes
D	yeah yeah
A	absolutely
B	er
A	absolutely
B	so
A	and I mean I in some respects I I I have the privilege of erm if I do go to the West Indies as least I'm not trying to do it through a language barrier
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	whereas when when you come here you have at least to get some level of of of local language
B	mm mm
A	so at least you if if you're both doing pidgin in each other's language
C	yeah
A	you're gonna at least
D	yeah you can
A	get somewhere
C	yeah
B	make some
C	yeah
B	some communication
C	yeah
A	but erm yeah
B	mm
A	I mean it's
B	wow
A	it is very interesting
D	yeah
A	erm
D	the the the the that I erm
C	right was gonna ask you
B	incredible
C	that's a long time
B	long time yeah
D	and one of the reasons was nothing to do with my family because we communicated I spoke my sister would ring me with
C	wow
D	on the phone and she
D	so it was nothing
C	big phone bills
D	about the family
D	but there were incidents on previous visits that I had erm that that really just I I decided you know no I can't be doing with this and er a couple of them were for example erm my husband and I my husband was English British we went to the the the the bank and erm
C	oh
D	he spoke
C	oh okay
D	and I thought what? excuse me?
C	mm
A	and that's a combination of race and gender it's
D	yes
A	it's it's quite a nice intersectional one actually it's it's
C	mm
A	erm
D	mm
C	mm
D	er
C	mm
D	er my sister even within my family I am now treated as a foreigner
D	yes erm
C	wow
D	they and they
C	that must be so
D	verbally said that
C	strange
D	they verbally said that
C	that they feel that way
C	mm
D	going on erm er and then there was an example I was erm er pregnant when I went the
A	one time
D	with yeah
D	and my husband and I went off to the beach one day and erm near the beach was this big hotel erm so we decided to have lunch at the hotel and as we were walking up to the hotel there was a blackboard which said fish and chips
C	mm
D	meal of the day
C	mm
B	mm
D	and this is
C	okay
B	uhu
D	and I looked at this blackboard and I said to
D	bloody
B	would you believe it?
D	I can't believe it
D	I cannot believe it
D	so we got into the restaurant and we sit down and the waiter comes and he says to us erm
C	mm
D	and he continued to look at me
D	and he said how you know the name of these fish? so I said my dear boy I was born on this island
D	I grew up here I lived here long before you were a twinkle in your mother's eye
D	or your father's eye
D	so what is the name of the fish you are serving with the bloody chips?
A	that was
B	so you were handing it out to this local lad?
D	yeah
C	because but you sensed that he'd already made some judgements about
D	yes
C	about you
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	judgment
C	yeah
D	or number
B	mm
D	whatever
C	yeah
D	followed by the the next question was
C	oh
B	yeah right there you go
C	okay
B	so what standing are are are you on?
D	which is very like here
A	oh it's you
D	I thought you
C	wow
D	you know
C	yeah
D	the frustrations
A	well yeah
D	I just let them
A	the village
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	three hundred thousand people spread across
B	mm
A	the island but it's a village
D	yeah
A	everybody's related to each other doesn't matter how far you go
A	along the tree I mean it's a village
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	and so it works
C	yeah
A	how it how things works
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yes if you say something in that ear it's going to end up in that ear very quickly
D	yeah
B	yes
A	and get back to you
B	mm
A	erm and so yeah it's
C	yeah
D	so I told him who my father was and he said oh and like here they call you Miss Miss and your first name or Mrs and your first name
C	right
D	rather than
B	mm
D	your title
B	mm
D	so he said oh Miss
D	well everything changed
C	oh right
D	everything
D	changed
A	mm
D	and that was a big eye opener for me
C	mm
D	you know? this the because it there I was on the one in the one few minutes before being treated as a foreigner
A	yeah as a tourist
D	a
C	yeah
D	erm but a tourist with well how how did you acquire this knowledge?
A	mm
D	type of thing
B	mm
D	and ah yeah yeah yeah you might be tourist but you're connected to the island through
A	mm
D	this pathway
C	mm
D	er so oh god
C	yeah
D	so there was that and there were a lot of other things that just made me feel unwelcome
C	mm
D	I felt like a stranger in well what
B	a stranger in a yeah
D	I called my own country
B	yeah well
C	in your own home
B	what became a strange land
D	yes I had become
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	mm
D	erm I decided I can't be doing with this because I shall be rude to people I shall be all sorts of things
C	mm
D	which would sort of make my father very angry with me because
C	yeah
A	and it would reflect back on the family
D	yeah yeah
C	go back on the family
B	yeah mm
A	did you know that your daughter was the?
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
D	oh my
B	yeah
D	god
C	arguing about which fish went
B	with the
C	with the chips
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	and she gave that lad what for you know
D	ah
C	she should just be happy to have
C	any fish
D	so er I decided to well it was not just that but it the whole life you know? it was so expensive to travel to the Caribbean then
C	yeah
B	mm
D	erm when you could take two weeks holiday in France
B	anywhere in Europe
D	Spain anywhere
C	yeah
D	in Europe
C	yeah
B	mm
D	for half the money or
C	yeah
D	a third of the money
C	yeah sure
D	you know? erm plus then added to that was the fact that if you were going that far two weeks in those days two weeks? no you
B	mm
D	because there were no direct flights
C	yeah
D	so it was I used to take my whole year's holiday
C	wow
D	six weeks' holiday
B	at that time
D	to go
C	yeah
D	and the hospital would only allow you to do that once every sort of five years
C	mm
D	because
C	yeah
B	mm
C	very good yeah
D	and whilst she appreciated the family connection and keeping the family connection and stuff like that she felt that when you took all your holiday in one chunk like that then you had the whole rest of the year where you had no breaks
C	it's true
B	mm mm
D	and you could you're you're you then become subset susceptible to falling ill
C	yeah
D	etcetera etcetera because you become over tired to making mistakes even
C	yeah
D	so all the all the sort of things that that entails so they wouldn't allow you to do it too regularly
C	right sure
D	so that that also put a
C	yeah
D	and gradually you you kept thinking well next year I'll go next year and and yeah it's just as you do you know?
C	yeah
D	tomorrow I'll do that
C	wow
D	and I thought oh my god yes
B	they have to
C	but what was it like going back after twenty-eight years to see your family members and?
D	well when I told people I was going and I hadn't seen my family or they hadn't seen me for this length of time people said to me will they recognise you?
C	yeah
B	mm
D	so I said
B	mm
A	so we got out the photos and
B	this this here
B	before and after
D	well
A	clearly not much difference no
B	actually
B	hanging out in hanging out in
C	oh god
A	I do sometimes wonder if I go to find
B	you see her down at the
A	a painting upstairs
A	in the loft which is aging for her
A	because I have more grey hair than she does
D	and I got most of that since coming here
C	yeah right
D	ah but I think it's the sun that's probably it has something to do with it but yeah it's erm
C	yeah
D	and
A	yes
D	two thousand and ten
A	mm
D	and erm
C	fill out
D	and I filled it out but I didn't fill out where I was going to be staying
A	oh god yes I remember this
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	because I don't write to her
C	yeah
D	so
A	and the addresses are kind of the same that they are here
D	yeah here
A	they they put a road name on the end of a road that's two miles long
C	okay right
A	hopefully it's the same name all the way through but
D	yes
A	not necessarily
C	yeah
B	I know yeah
D	now you see why I
B	but

A	yes yes I recall that which made it
B	mm
A	so hard to find places
C	yeah
B	yeah it does
D	so er
D	she said er well we need an address I think because was on a British passport
C	mm
D	then so they treated me like a British foreigner
A	well as you recall they did that exactly the same to us when we were erm went in on on T and T passports as well it's it's erm
D	oh yes when when are you going when you get where did they?
A	yes
D	they wanted a
A	yes
D	we didn't have to fill in a landing
A	yes we did we didn't fill it in on the plane cos you thought we wouldn't have to and then we have to fill it in on the
D	oh yes
A	arrivals hall
D	yes
D	yeah
A	because they make everybody who's
A	arriving fill it in because the other half of it is the customs form
D	yeah yeah yes I forgot that

D	she said cos she said to me is my sister she said is she meeting you? so I said yes so she called erm another official like a runner person in uniform and sent me out with her
C	to get the

C	address
D	so get
C	right
D	so this might be
C	and then she'd bring you back
D	so to get the address
D	as I could go back
C	as collateral
C	she's not gonna leave her daughter at the airport
D	I wonder how much they would have got for her

A	okay
C	yeah
A	er I'll just check because people have erm
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah er and we're a bit short on plain coffee so
C	oh okay
C	yeah five spice coffee sounds lovely yeah
D	right
C	that
C	really good
D	she tells me off
C	yeah
D	because I drink it with milk because
C	oh oh
D	yeah
C	coffee purist
D	yeah
C	right
D	and I didn't get around to see half of them cos it was so hot and humid
C	mm
D	I couldn't oh
C	yeah
D	do with this travelling about er apparently they were very offended erm
C	oh
D	about that
B	yeah you didn't make it
C	dear
D	and erm
B	mm
D	yes that I didn't come to see them and they sort of er said to my sister you kept her all to yourself for six weeks
C	yeah whoa
D	she was she had the
D	don't
C	did you just get to
D	yeah
C	from her family
D	you know oh my god
D	rather than so I went back and told her that satisfied her
C	yeah
D	from the
B	yeah
D	airport we watched the plane flying out over the you know that it flies and goes off to Grenada
C	yeah
D	and erm
C	and you collected
D	yes
D	and then there came the point where I decided to reapply for my citizenship of the
C	oh
D	island because when I sort of erm going back to having British er applying and
C	ah two years before?
D	two years
B	before they were
D	before
B	oh right
D	so they
C	so
D	took my British my Trinidad and Tobago passport and gave me an exchanged of British passport
C	right
D	so erm I then had to reapply to become
C	to get
D	a citizen
C	yeah
B	mm mm mm
C	uhu
D	and er because as a non citizen I cannot own anything there erm
C	yeah
D	except
B	yeah you don't have any of your
C	you've got all of these limitations
D	yeah
B	land rights and problems
C	yeah
B	and
C	yeah
B	all sorts of things
D	yeah
B	I see
D	so I set about applying for that and er actually it wasn't as painful as I thought it could be
C	yeah
D	er it would have been more painful if you think this place is bureaucratic
C	really?
D	or certainly Tobago I can't speak for Trinidad itself of course that's a bigger er but erm it is er my brother tells me a story for example of his driving licence was it running out or ran out or something?
C	mm
D	and he went to renew it and they said to him oh you can't do it for a year or we can't do it for a year or something er so he dropped it on the floor and he said I've lost it
D	really
A	I was looking up because I'm looking to go to Canada
C	okay yeah
B	yes
A	and they only issue five year passports in T and T it means
C	oh
A	you can do at least they're half the price of British ones so
C	well that's something
A	which is er
C	yeah
B	mm okay
C	yeah
A	but I was looking okay so when I need to renew it how do I do it? well there's a a T and T high commission in Ottawa and then I realised that all of the paperwork that I had to submit to erm prove who I was and all of my identity and and why I was allowed citizenship is in the London office in
C	right
A	but in order to do my renewal it looks like I'm going to need all of that paperwork all over again because it's a different office
C	oh no and they can't
D	oh they're not
C	can't
D	they they can't
A	which means
C	access your
A	I will need
C	your London copies?
D	my marriage certificate
A	your passport your marriage certificate all of that
B	all of those
C	the originals? no certified copies probably
A	originals and
B	I had to do that
A	three colour certified copies
D	yes because I had when we did it in erm in England
A	I'm really hoping that they'll have got rid of that by the time I need to do it
C	I
D	yeah
C	hope so
B	mm
A	or maybe you just go to UK
D	well yeah just come for a visit
C	that's it
A	oh god
C	you'll save yourself the hassle of
C	and the cost of it
B	because I think it
B	I would go on
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah I think I'd be
D	yeah I think that
A	I would just
D	would be the easiest
A	go back to the UK
C	cos they've got this copy
A	spend two weeks
D	yeah
B	mm
A	er see some friends
D	yeah
A	erm
D	and get your passport
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and solve that yeah
D	because that's how I renew my passport now it it they because the way you send it from here
B	oh no you couldn't
A	that's not true anymore you can't even do that you have to send it back to the UK
D	ah
C	well you
D	okay
C	used to be able to send it to Spain
D	yeah
C	what the British Embassy
D	yeah
A	yes
C	in Spain?
D	yeah
A	and they now
A	are no longer doing within Europe no longer doing erm er
C	piggy backing
A	consulate erm
C	kind of
A	you have to go
C	yeah
B	mm
A	it has to be it has to go back
D	mm
A	erm and they reserve the right to spend at least three months doing it if it's come from outside the UK
C	right
A	whereas if you go into the UK you can get it done the same day
D	yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah
D	so I just did that
C	yeah
D	and in January
C	turn up on the spot
D	yeah I would just
C	yeah
D	booked a flight we were going over er and we went over and I
C	yeah
D	the the
B	mm
C	yeah
D	so erm they booked me the appointment er er where will you be staying? Manchester ah Liverpool will be I say that's where I was hoping to go
D	yeah right fine
C	yeah
D	and er off I went four hours
C	brilliant
D	back and they actually put the time that it was ready on it and it had been ready long before the four hours
C	wow
D	erm which was
A	that
D	fantastic
C	that's
D	but I got a chance
C	impressive
D	to walk round Liverpool and
C	yeah
D	er where I'd never been
B	mm
C	how long ago was that that you renewed?
D	er January last year
C	god
D	yeah
B	mm
A	a friend of mine is
B	okay
C	wow
A	has just come back gone back to to Germany today having gone er to the UK er a week and a half ago in order to renew his passport
C	right
A	because one has to carry ID with you at one all the time I Germany
C	in Germany yeah
A	because it's er it's
C	true
A	a big thing
C	yeah
A	his passport has lived in his wallet
C	right
A	his ten year old
C	bit tattered
A	passport
A	they took one look at it and said we're not doing it in one day
C	oh
A	he was very fortunate that he had booked a client meeting so that he had extended his stay in the UK long enough that he wasn't going to miss his flight back
C	oh right
A	it took
C	okay
A	five days to do it
C	oh
A	erm and so
C	is that because he'd been a naughty boy and?
B	well just cos
A	it's because
B	if it says
D	yeah it was
B	it's an existing passport
A	but they they
B	which their conditions
A	wanted he has to
D	yeah
C	they had to really check it
D	yeah
B	mm
C	that it's
A	and make sure
C	the that it
A	that it isn't
C	wasn't a fake
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah and where he's been
A	because they're they're
C	mm
A	the moment
B	mm
A	because oh my god foreign people getting passports
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	get over yourselves
C	yeah exactly
A	but yes okay the British passport is still erm
D	oh er
A	one of the top
D	a prize
A	three
A	in the
D	yeah
A	world for allowing you access into other
C	mm
A	countries
C	mm er
A	oh
C	and
A	fantastic
C	yeah you have a number of locations
A	mm
D	yeah
C	you can go to and air miles you can use and er yeah you had fun didn't you? going right which one shall I use today?
D	yeah
C	because I know some countries showing the British passport isn't favoured because Brits obviously have
D	yeah
C	had well
D	yeah
C	er
B	a
D	a
B	colonial past
D	a
C	bad bad
D	yeah
C	reputation in some countries
B	mm
C	but you know and and also the difference in prices sometimes the New Zealand
D	oh
C	not visa sorry but using your your
D	yeah
C	your visa or your passport means that your visa was cheaper
D	right
C	not only were you
D	yeah
C	but it's cheaper too
D	yeah yeah
B	uhu
C	so the the one thing he had to remember though was which one did I come in on?
D	come in on that's right
C	and go out on
D	that was I I was yeah
B	I I'd get there
C	you know
B	quite often actually I'll I'll hand over er the wrong passport
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	and then they'll they'll look at me blankly
C	then it's like
B	because they can't work out
D	yeah
B	how
B	how come you're in this
D	yeah
B	country
D	yeah yeah
C	but
B	when
D	but you we we've got no
B	with this you're not on the
B	you're not on my system
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	and and it it takes them about five minutes to
D	yeah
B	do you have another passport?
C	yeah their
D	yeah
C	set procedure
B	you know
D	yeah
C	examining you
D	yeah
C	after that
B	and that works
C	yeah
B	that works fine
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	but it can send off the wrong red light
D	yes yeah yeah
B	if you're talking to the wrong people
C	and talk about
D	people
C	having
B	mm
C	passports at all I remember we were flying this was our first leg out of the UK on that world trip
B	oh yeah
C	er from London Heathrow to er LA and we were going on to to
C	Rarotonga but anyway
B	mm
C	we were going that way
B	mm
C	and erm we had a very short erm change around at er
D	mm
C	LA LA and I didn't know this but even though we had a connecting flight you do always have to take your baggage off at LA
D	ah
C	and then you have to put it back on
D	oh right okay
C	it's your responsibility
D	yeah yeah
C	and you have forty minutes to do this in
D	oh god
C	when we came out of the plane
B	we were briefed on the plane
C	yeah
D	right
B	they said
C	you have to
B	anybody who's making this transfer you need to follow us we will take you to this you do this
D	yeah
B	and then you have to go back through and then we'll find you on the other side and take you to the plane
D	right
B	cos there's a really quick
C	yeah
B	turnaround
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	so they had any
D	yeah
C	a representative
D	yeah
B	you know
C	yeah thank god they did
D	yeah
C	because er I go through diddle le de and I'm like waiting so we I might have been one along from
D	yeah
C	has he popped to the toilet? something like that
D	yeah
C	so I went to this Air
C	is this very common?
C	and he said
D	oh
D	oh that word
C	detained
C	and at this stage I knew
D	yeah
C	and I had
D	yeah
C	checks and things like this
C	and I'm just like what?
C	thinking what am I gonna tell me dad?
C	so then he said calm down this happens and when in America especially in LA Airport if somebody gets detained you do not you have to save face
D	yes
C	you have to remain ultra cool
D	yeah
C	you cannot show them
D	yeah
C	anything
D	yeah this is where I say I cannot
A	really really
D	go I would not go to America
A	going through
D	because
A	American immigration is hard work you you you have to be completely as calm as you can and they do everything in their power
C	to rile you
A	to make it as
C	yeah
A	irritating as possible
C	true it's so true
A	erm it is
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	er
C	even the question of how long are you in this country?
A	yeah
D	uhu
C	the way they ask it
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	it just
A	I mean
C	gets your
D	yeah
C	like
A	friend of mine erm is of Indian origin he now has a British passport but he
C	right
A	but the way they treated him was basically you'll you you are of Asian origin you must be
D	you are a terrorist or a
A	well no
D	er yeah
A	not a terrorist
D	ah
A	you must be going to disappear into the country and become
D	oh right
B	mm
A	and
D	yeah
B	a European citizen
A	a European and illegal
D	yeah
A	in in
C	mm
D	yeah
A	there was very much erm and the American system is very much that that undertone of erm so when are you leaving then?
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah show us your flight out of here
D	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	whereas the Canadians the the the difference with going into Canada is erm you turn up and er and I I
C	mm
A	I didn't feel pressured
C	mm
A	erm I I I
C	oh wow
A	and so I I I arrived into Toronto and erm and they said so how long are you staying? erm two and a

C	stay longer
A	why are you coming?
C	yeah
D	yeah

C	yeah
A	I've got money to spend I'll spend it
C	yeah
A	elsewhere
C	I'll go yeah elsewhere exactly
C	right
D	place of Americans go over to
C	in Montreal
D	we we
C	right
D	just decided we would come and see the place
C	yeah
D	and er the the whole attitude was so all through our visit there so friendly
D	because she wanted us to come to her queue because she wanted to talk to us
D	and when we got there she said oh are you are you on holiday here? erm do you like it? er how long have you been here? and all these questions these
C	mm
D	lovely positive questions
C	yeah
D	and wherever we went that was the sort of erm er er attitude we had
B	and engagement with the
D	yeah
B	mm
D	everybody was so happy and friendly and that we chose to come to Montreal
C	yeah

A	cos it's in a it's in a
C	yeah
A	slightly odd font and er and driving and it's like
D	yeah
C	and on the M25
B	mm
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
D	yeah quite
A	but I haven't actually

B	doing this
D	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	well
D	I am sure
A	the the the er the minicab drivers in Manchester got the became quite fond of erm watching a DVD while driving
B	oh yeah
A	so a DVD mini mini DVD player on the dashboard
C	oh my word
B	on the dash mm
A	erm
C	yeah
A	take your life into your hands stepping in the car
C	that's right
A	and praying that they're not gonna run into anything
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	when they get to a good bit
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's like can't take your eyes off it
A	on the upside it did mean that they didn't chatter at you incessantly
D	mm
B	yes
C	that's true that's true yes and push their
D	where do you come from?
C	opinions on you
D	I
A	mm
D	I remember erm was it a taxi? I
A	yeah
D	as you used to do and er
A	oh yes oh at Gatwick
C	yes
A	where the the train station
C	and there were no lifts
C	yeah the train station yeah
B	mm
D	only
A	no
D	escalators
C	yeah I know it's crazy isn't it?
D	and I'm thinking
A	it's very
D	what?
A	poorly organised
D	what?
C	how are you meant to get your bags your luggage?
D	yeah so I said to this guy er at the I I asked this guy the airport guy you know erm porter type guy I said where is there a lift? and er so he said there isn't one and he said don't worry just wait here I'll help you I think he was the guy going round with the er thing collecting the rubbish and stuff
B	okay
D	and erm so he helped me downstairs with er with the thing he was white
C	yeah
D	and he said to me where have you come in from? so I said oh the Caribbean and he said
D	I said yeah with this little luggage I said I can't manage with this little luggage never mind
C	yeah let alone the whole lot
D	yeah
D	because well you stand and watch the people taking their
B	mm
C	yeah
B	mm
C	so but what are they taking back? when they come back from Tobago
D	it's usually clothes and stuff
C	it's it's it's clothes
D	yeah
C	okay
D	yeah
A	because again being a small island while they do have some links to the US they they're behind the times in fashions and stuff
C	right
D	yeah
A	so erm
B	and it tends to be more expensive
A	yeah
D	oh yeah
A	absolutely
D	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	you you you
B	mm
A	bring in stuff that you're that's that's up to date and er
C	yeah sure sure
A	erm
D	but there and there's still erm mentally erm I have a big link to the UK
C	right
D	because the UK has been
A	and a lot of the commonwealth places
D	the mother country
B	yeah there is
D	yeah yeah
B	yeah definitely
A	the the the
D	erm
B	mm
A	there there is still very much that link
D	mm
C	mm
B	uhu
C	mm
D	I mean we were going at erm I er having gone back in twenty ten I think decided erm we would go every other year so
B	mm
D	we've done that
C	oh that's nice
D	and then erm
C	yeah
C	okay
D	probably about right
C	yeah
D	yeah okay
C	are the flights expensive actually? from when you go from here to to the UK and then UK to
D	well if you add it all up together
C	okay yeah
D	but I I tend to
C	yeah
D	exclude this bit to the UK
C	oh okay
D	er mentally I don't
C	yeah
D	really
B	yeah I think you kind of
C	right and when you get to
B	you need to
D	yeah
C	yeah okay
B	mm
D	yeah I I exclude that mentally I just think of the flight from England
C	yeah
D	because if you start to add it all up you think to yourself why am I doing this? you know I could go so much further
B	well you could go round the
D	yeah
B	this whole area
C	how how long is the flight from the UK?
D	from UK
C	yeah
D	eight hours
A	eight nine hours yeah
D	yeah
C	and who do you
B	oh that's
C	normally fly with? is it the
A	we
C	national carrier?
D	yeah
A	prefer to fly with Virgin actually
D	uhu
C	oh right
A	but the
D	yeah
A	the three people who tend to fly out er from the UK are Virgin BA and Monarch
B	mm
C	right
A	erm and
C	okay
A	Virgin is is pleasant though erm and they have now replaced their rather aging 747s
C	right
A	they were getting a bit tired
C	okay
B	yeah
A	BA lose your luggage
D	yes
B	yes
C	bloody waste of time
D	where was I telling somebody that last? oh yes
D	one of the guys from the the the professors yeah
A	we
D	yeah
B	yes
C	oh gosh
D	this is
B	I mean I I had that fight on
D	yeah
B	on an international
D	this is ridiculous
B	we we were on erm
B	we flew this was it
C	Air Asia
B	yeah it was Air Asia
C	the direct one was it a
B	yeah

C	yeah
B	it was I think going to Australia Australia Singapore
C	yeah
B	wasn't it?
A	oh yes
C	yes
B	and er so their
C	it was seven or eight hours
B	so er
A	so not a short flight then?
B	we were sitting in a four block so there were two er Malaysian ladies next to us and and then us there and I said I'd have some water tried to charge me some money and I said no no I'm not paying for water just go and get me some cold water I know planes have it so just go and get me some
A	erm it's an international
B	and er then
A	flight
B	we ended up in a
A	and actually there are regulations
B	in an hour
A	that say they must give you water
C	yeah
B	we had an hour tête à tête
B	and er she went and she filled up this cup of water and it was hot water she brought me back hot water and I'm like no I I just need cold water
C	this was embarrassing
B	you know
B	and in the end I just
D	you're like
B	I started laying out this kind of UN convention
D	yeah
B	stuff right?
D	yeah
B	and and that that got her but the thing was
D	oh
B	erm the two Malaysian ladies beside me
D	she has my phone before I do
B	they they were in
D	yeah
B	not possible you know
A	yeah no I mean it's something that
B	and which is rubbish
A	the cheap airlines I I I will never fly
C	but water
A	yeah
C	I mean and if I
C	right if there was sort of like a litre that would last you maybe
A	yeah
C	four four hours fine
A	but no I mean it is disgusting it
C	okay
A	erm which could come from when I was working in the UK er and I finally got back to being able to eat cheese
