B	mm and this UK and true story?
A	no it is in America it is a true story in America in oh a state I can't remember
A	no I know
A	but the second series I wasn't really sure at first because it is so different just like the first series is you know not exactly well it is kind of star-crossed lovers he is from a Muslim family she is from a
B	so this is a different case now?
A	uhu
B	so what happened with the first one? did it go to appeal and did he get out?
A	not yet they are still waiting
B	oh okay
A	to be continued erm but that was you know teenagers they were seventeen or eighteen when it happened star-crossed lovers he is Muslim and she is Korean and their families didn't want them to be together erm and you know and blah blah blah but the second series is more high-profile it's about an American soldier who was camped or based in Afghanistan and he said he just walked away one day from the base he was supposed to be manning his position and he just did a runner from the army
B	mm
A	abandoning his post
B	you'd think what more punishment could there be having been tortured by the Taliban?
A	yeah but you know all the time that he was with the Taliban he was trying to collect intel find out information it was like
B	where did he think he was going to go in Afghanistan?
A	well he was just hoping he would just be able to evade evade evade get to Pakistan and then sort of just you know hide away or go home and hide or whatever I don't know what he expected to happen but you know the sort of
B	mm
A	well not identified him as only an enemy but
B	yeah you see some of
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	okay
A	so like accumulate so it is really live
B	interesting
A	yeah
B	so what's the purpose of the broadcast? is it you know who is producing it as a a media outlet er a radio station a?
A	no it is just this woman
B	this woman
A	this woman
B	this woman so Serial who produces that? is that like a Fox CBN News thing?
A	no
B	oh okay
A	yeah so it's
B	yeah
A	mm so it is really good for the gym or for walking around erm just when you've got nothing else to do
B	mm
A	but podcasts some are funny I was listening to another one and I was walking around and I was like I started laughing and I thought I'm going to get beat up if I'm just walking along the streets laughing hysterically to myself people are going to take offence
B	that's alright it is an English girl
A	I don't know why with a strange Russian accent
B	mm those podcasts sound interesting though
A	yeah er
B	mm I do like the way this whole sort of multimedia universe that we live in and open up new possibilities and new making new connections that aren't necessarily connected with the mainstream
A	mm
A	I don't remember those days but you know what I mean but you know it like people who listen to The Archers erm
B	ha ha they sorted it
A	erm like people who listen to The Archers but on like Iplayer because they missed it at the time or whatever
B	wow
A	that is dedication so
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah if you go to STV player and you do it through Mozilla you don't get any adverts yeah anyway I was watching that and I kept having to rewind it because I was faffing about on WhatsApp erm on the the text and Viber and what have you messaging people then I thought what am I doing? am I watching telly? or am I communicating on my phone? make your mind up you can't do both so
A	mm
B	yeah I flick my phone onto airplane mode quite a lot now
A	but that's good
B	yeah and it charges quicker as well
A	I've never been erm
B	no
A	and we are losing this this like ability to concentrate or this er attention span and it's like what's that? oh it's a message
B	yeah what I like about you is maybe it's because your phone is recording this I don't think it is but you are not looking at every text message you get when we go out
A	yeah
B	and that's a general rule you don't do that and I like that
A	a lot of the time I don't do that is because I don't have wi-fi so I'm actively prevented from using my phone
B	mm mm
A	yeah
A	you know like it's
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	yes gosh imagine using a phone for its original purpose how disgusting
A	I've not made a phone call for about five years
A	why on earth would I want to do that?
B	you want to Facetime yes Skype yes a phone call goodness no
A	oh no why would I want to do that?
A	that's funny
B	so why are you suspicious of people who don't engage with the technology in that way?
A	no I
B	mm
A	I don't know I just think people are being sort of contentious for the sake of it and they would just be a lot happier if they just sort of
B	yeah I found my German friends and Polish friends are all my Facebook friends none of them post anything I call them lurkers they are Facebook lurkers
A	mm
B	well I did have a phase where I blocked the lot of them
A	yeah one of my friends
B	I suppose it was the cultural difference the Germans are very suspicious they sort of
A	what so like the government is watching?
B	yeah yeah I mean
A	that's hilarious
B	yeah
A	no I just
B	mm
A	and I thought oh I don't know
B	not straightaway
A	I don't know
B	I think if I got a lot of begging letters and grovel unsolicited approaches from people for money I'd soon get rid of it because I wouldn't be doing with all of that guilt erm or to engage with that level of victimhood we were talking about earlier erm
A	mm
B	mm
A	my friend at university once changed my Facebook status to oh I've just won two thousand pounds on a scratch card
B	what your status?
A	yeah FB it me and
B	how are you today?
A	it was only two thousand imaginary pounds
B	not even two thousands real pounds
A	but imagine if you if you won like fifty million real pounds
B	I'd like to think that my friends would text me or ring and say oh I hear you've won some money congratulations really delighted for you
A	and not go
B	yeah rather than how are you?
A	it is just like fucking hell drinks are on you pal
B	I would be tempted to try that
A	I just won ten thousand
B	well I will know what that will be well English people would say what's that then fifty P?
A	it is really fun it was just like why have you all?
B	I don't know I suppose er maybe there's a modicum of self-worth attached to knowing somebody or being connected with somebody who has something perceptibly wonderful like having won some money it's a bit like you know
A	mm yeah the grass is always greener
B	well I don't know it is like having a connection to a famous person erm that kind of a thing it's almost like a person's self-worth or status can go up a notch because of their association or connection with something perceptibly positive I don't know I just thought throw that out there
A	mm
B	yeah because you've got some money mm hooray mm
B	I don't know
A	I don't know either
B	it's interesting
A	what time is it?
B	I think we can set up some little social experiments
A	er on the clock
A	sorry do you want any cake or coffee or?
B	I don't want any cake but I might get a coffee and I will definitely go and wee do you want cake or some coffee?
A	no I don't want anything thank you I guess it won't have milk in it will it?
B	do you want a cup of the
A	what is the
B	cow milk
A	is it?
B	yeah oh that's true
A	that's what I mean we are in a vegan place that's why I said
B	ah it could be soya
A	that's why I said what's your
B	oh I don't know
A	that's why I said maybe if we go
B	you want to go regular coffee shop?
A	I would like I would like actual milk from an actual animal rather than from a the rather from nuts or rice
B	like an actual cow
A	oh don't say we're the only animals that drink milk from another animal?
B	no I don't you know I don't really like it that much it does give me the runs if it have too much of it
B	oh yes
A	why you don't like milk
B	yes yeah thinking about you know really this stuff is for baby cows and I am not a baby cow
A	I know but but for as long as there's been cows people have drunk their milk
B	yeah but no but
A	I think so
B	I don't know which came first cows or humans?
A	I don't know
B	no I don't know
A	we'll google it are you going to the toilet?
