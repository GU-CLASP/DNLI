A	right
B	I know
A	yeah
B	hmm?
A	well they should tell us on Saturday shouldn't they
B	Saturday yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah who's this? See I was confused cos he used so much text speak in his email
A	yeah
B	I was like what? I mean surely her whoever's name it doesn't
A	yeah it's probably difficult to pronounce
B	I was wondering if it meant we
A	what with a German accent?
B	yeah once we've got that ticket
A	yeah
B	and you know how quickly we can ask them
A	yeah
B	I mean should we ask that before we go?
A	well maybe we should send an email just
B	there's a few things you know
A	yeah
B	but I don't want to sound like a cow
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah they should understand that
A	mm
B	and er then I don't know
A	okay
B	that's it
A	what in the department?
B	well no and all the rest are from India or from Oman or from the maybe a few other places
A	oh really? So there's no other English people there?
B	there's just
A	okay
B	but they might who knows where they're from? I don't know
A	ah well it's time to get excited now though
B	there's probably
A	yeah
B	they seem this university seems more local
A	yeah
B	omanis get preference to anybody else apart from maybe the English language speaking courses
A	well that's good
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	you have like
A	well you get introduced by to a hundred people
B	forty
A	and then you introduce yourself to someone and they say oh we've already met
B	yeah
A	oh sorry
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
A	but you said that there's no direct flight
B	there's a direct
A	really? That's strange I thought Heathrow would go
B	yeah there was the erm Gulf Air
A	Gulf Air's been bought out by?
B	Bahrain
A	Bahrain?
B	well it said something like that
A	really?
B	well that might not be true
A	oh so we're going to have to go to Bahrain first?
A	Emirates
B	Emirates
A	er
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	ouch
B	it's a longer flight than I thought
A	mm
B	I thought it was only six hours
A	is it longer than that?
B	yeah
A	oh shit
B	yeah I'm happy about that
A	yeah that's quite nice just for going on holidays or coming back here
B	yeah yeah
A	Don't have to piss about do we
B	and just having the big city so near
A	yeah and if
B	all the amenities that you can get in the bigger city than you can in a little place
A	if there's a direct flight to Gatwick we can stay at your sisters'
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	we should have said whichever one's easiest
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	like the the price range is crazy
A	yeah
B	yeah but none of the plane
A	no
B	I think
A	the best ones are well the Middle Eastern ones
B	Qatar
A	Qatar
B	yeah and I read about Omani Air and they seem alright too
A	they're nice
B	but they do have like the second hand planes from the others but
A	do they serve alcohol on the on these ones?
B	no
A	you need alcohol for an eight hour journey on a plane
B	but can you imagine
A	ah no surely not
B	and do you remember how wrecked we were? Not wrecked we were just really tired when we did that flight from Thailand to Korea
A	Korea
B	and we didn't know where we were
A	no
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	why? I don't know
A	I don't think the weather helped either cos we went from about thirty degrees to to zero
B	ah it was cold
A	we didn't have a coat did we
B	no we didn't even have any money
A	and then you got Bird Flu
B	or whatever it was yeah
A	it was a bit of a disaster that wasn't it
B	mm
A	yeah well well they're flying us on Tuesday
B	yeah
A	so then we've only got Wednesday before the weekend anyway
B	ah
A	so Wednesday they might just let us settle in
B	yeah yeah
A	erm hopefully and
B	or pop into the school
A	yeah
B	erm I I don't think so
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I can't see them giving us a week
B	more than that
A	yeah
A	mm
B	oh God
A	well Indian food
B	well you never know until you get there
A	ah but proper food again though
B	food yeah yeah
A	and you've got all those hikes as well
B	yeah
A	and frankincense
B	when when is the turtle season?
A	it's all year I think
B	no it can't be
A	no
B	it must be one part of the year that they come up to the beach
A	no idea
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just worried about a house as well
A	yeah
B	oh such a beautiful house
A	well I'd be happy with an apartment
B	I'd be happy with a modern apartment if we can get it furnished and if there's
A	yeah well it has
B	yeah
A	oh
B	if there's some sort of erm gym or hopefully a swimming pool near by
A	mm
B	and like all of their swimming pools are going to have to be closed off because you know and they'll
A	that's true
B	apart from in the big hotels
A	yeah
B	so
A	ah I hadn't thought of that
B	yeah
A	and the same with the gym as well
B	yeah
A	might have men's hours and women's hours for that
B	yeah yeah
A	they probably would actually wouldn't they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah and I think we're gonna have a lot more of a divided lifestyle from what we're used to
A	yeah
B	we're used to doing everything together
A	yeah
B	yeah but we won't go in them
A	yes yeah
B	yeah it's gonna be fairly open
A	fairly Westernised
B	yeah
A	especially as we're near the airport
B	like typical tourists do
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't mind buying a few more outfits
A	mm
B	you know something that will go with all of my skirts or something
A	yeah
B	at work straight away
A	no you can't help it no
A	it's quite important as a teacher to give the right image
B	if they didn't approve of something I was wearing and I was only wearing it because I didn't have anything else you know
A	yeah
B	say like our baggages didn't arrive or something
A	yeah
B	impression on you no matter what the circumstances
A	what turning up in hot pants and smelling of gin?
B	well and drinking on the plane
A	yeah and getting duty free bottles clanking
B	clanking
A	hello
B	hello erm yeah
A	yeah we don't no
B	really?
A	well if we do it would have to go in the main luggage cos I'm not carrying it
B	you can't put it in the main luggage
A	no
B	you can't cos duty free is the other side
A	no I mean when we arrive in Muscat
B	oh there might be some just as you come out?
A	or put the not so your not holding it in your hands
B	ah okay
A	mm
B	and we don't even drink that much
A	it's got to last us all year
B	right so there's a couple of things we need to write to him about
A	yeah
B	sharing toilets with them
A	no
B	that's just sounds like a a summer school
A	not when we first get there
B	that sounds like a summer school to me and that sounds like a nightmare
A	no I don't mind paying for a hotel until we find somewhere
B	well we're just going to have to forfeit the costs aren't we
A	yeah
B	I mean they take  they take  some of the money off for that accommodation anyway
A	yeah yeah I saw that
B	yeah
A	no
B	it's not like you remember when we went to Tunisia? Wow they're gonna help us out with a hotel for a week
A	yeah
B	it kind of calms you down a bit doesn't it
A	yeah
B	oh they're being so nice
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and we've got a driver to take you around
B	yeah
A	we're not going to have any of that
B	we'll be lucky if we
A	yeah we just need to speak to as many people as we can cos that's the main thing for me is finding a house as quickly as possible
B	well especially if we're paying for a hotel
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	yeah the first three months is going to be pretty tough
B	I mean and if there's no hotels right near the college and we have to get a taxi every day or what you know
A	yeah
B	yeah but taxis are hard to get in Oman
A	mm
B	you don't wave them down
A	can't you?
B	it's they're not so many
A	well surely that's the same isn't it? I mean how are the students going to get to school?
B	they've probably all got their own cars they're they're university students
A	mm
B	mm yeah there's no point speculating
A	no
B	find out when we get there but that is important that we can go home
A	yeah
B	Cos we're not
A	yeah
B	right
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	can you?
A	yeah
B	email them
A	oh right yeah
B	yeah if you can email
A	oh what's that smell? That's horrible
B	Don't know
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well of course it is
B	it's just this big break
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's one because I haven't been doing anything
B	mm
A	and then we're going to be straight into a hundred miles an hour again
B	mm
A	how? Which way are you going?
B	this way
A	have we got time to go this way? It's getting dark
B	yeah
A	what are you most looking forward to about?
B	I'm looking forward to all the shops and the markets
A	yeah
B	you know like the big big busy ones I can only do once a month or something
A	yeah
B	no the massive souks
A	oh yeah
B	in the medina or something
A	I don't think they're going to be tourist markets either so that's good
B	Oman's becoming more popular as a tourist place
A	yeah but it's not going to be like Tunisia where you just hassled
B	Muscat will be
A	I can't see that
B	yeah well I think they're quite chilled out people aren't they
A	it's gonna be more authentic
B	well by the sounds of it
A	yeah
B	they might be like what's she on about?
A	I don't know Dawn
B	you know she seems a bit highly strung or something
A	yeah like boulevards yeah
B	they're beautiful really
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah that was a very residential area though
B	mm
A	I can't see this being so residential
B	apartments
A	intersected by fairly busy roads
B	yeah not
A	I don't know it's funny isn't it
B	mm
A	and then you get there
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I don't think they'll be many women on the beach
B	no
A	mm
B	I'm not too fussed about sunbathing with a bikini or that's okay I can deal with that
A	yeah
B	but I what I missed from Tunisia is erm
A	mm
B	and you can sit and there's enough room for a table so you can sit and play cards or you can sit and listen to music
A	yeah
B	it sounds like I'm a right snob now
A	so you're not looking at an apartment then
B	well there's plenty of apartments where you know it might be overlooking a big wide space so nobody can actually see you anyway
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah?
B	shall we email
A	mm
B	I mean I know he doesn't like in Seeb but it will be nice because there's the British Council crowd
A	yeah
B	and then we've got
A	yeah
B	not Muscat Muscat College of Technology crowd
A	yeah
B	so that's a few contacts
A	yeah it's nice to have a couple people there
B	mm
A	I'm just looking forward to the food
B	I know you are
A	and the location
B	yeah
A	and Dubai
B	see
A	Dubai's just down the road
B	yeah and Dubai
A	mind you that is just a big shopping centre isn't it
B	what I'm hoping is that they do some sort of girly activities
A	oh yeah
B	oh I hope
A	oh definitely
B	I just really hope there will be
A	no they've yeah they've got a massive Indian community
B	yeah
A	probably all the different types
B	yeah
A	they'll probably be like ayurvidic stuff as well
B	yeah
A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that side of it we just didn't
A	belly dancing
B	no
A	yeah only in the tourist hotels
B	yeah yeah
A	it's nothing to do with Tunisia
B	no but
A	and none of the dancers were Tunisian
B	but I thought you know because nearby culture that they'd be
A	yeah I thought they'd be drumming
B	well you've got the darbuka but it's only at weddings
A	yeah yeah it wasn't like groups of guys hanging around on the street corners jamming
B	no
A	yeah
B	it's like they'd never thought of that before
A	well they're for weddings aren't they like you said
B	yeah
A	I don't think Oman's going to be much cop for music
B	oh I thought it would be better
A	I don't know
B	yeah
B	I heard some stuff erm before
A	and if you're doing like ayurvidic stuff I can get back into my tablas
B	yeah
A	hopefully they'll be
B	or you could do some yoga too
A	yeah well I wouldn't mind doing yoga
B	yeah
A	but there should be some tabla teachers
B	yeah
A	they're a bit heavy aren't they
B	well I suppose you could always check it all out and then when we came come back in August maybe
A	no I'll check it out first
B	yeah but you want to take them home and practise
A	mm
B	you know something fairly soundproof so that we can play our music and and not have to if we're watching a movie ah turn it down
A	yeah that's important for me
B	ah that used to be such a nightmare
A	you're just aware of it all the time aren't you
B	yeah aware of somebody else hearing you after after
A	no
B	I don't even like action
A	I suppose any movie
B	kung fu
A	yeah yeah
B	and the kids
A	yeah
B	I'll wait until we get our
A	yeah there's just been so many ups and downs hasn't there
B	it feels like I it feels like it's time to get excited and I have been
A	yeah but I've I've got so excited literally three or four times and then gone again cos we got other news and it's just like what? It's been up and down up and down hasn't it
B	there was that day
A	so I don't want to allow myself to get too up before I'm on the plane really
B	no there's several things that I'm a little bit worried about to be honest
A	right
B	and you know
A	yeah
B	yeah and but there's all this writing underneath it saying ah but this is subject to you being available to start in February term
A	really?
B	I don't understand it all
A	well surely no I mean
B	we're going to have to say I'm going to take this back and read it over night
A	yeah yeah
B	we've just to have that
A	oh definitely
B	you can't trust people these days
A	what do you mean these days?
B	well not these days
A	no well it's an important thing isn't it
B	I like to be trusting because I like to have faith in people but I think you you have to check everything
A	you can't jump in blindly that's foolish
B	no
A	yeah
B	like oh oh oh and you're reading it
A	well we'll cross that bridge when we get to it
B	yeah
A	it's not going to stop us going now is it
B	no
A	no
B	mm
A	and we've always done it before and it's always worked out
B	yeah yeah
A	and we've got no alternatives cos we're not exactly stay here
B	no well we're not now cos we turned down that job so it's obvious we didn't want to stay
A	yeah exactly
B	deep down
A	yeah we don't want to
B	yeah
A	I've still got a couple of years of adventure left in us yet
B	yeah
A	I think this might be the last one though
B	yeah
A	well that's the thing isn't it
B	well we could
A	well we could but yeah
B	even if we had a good job it would be tough starting up
A	mm
B	but then it's tough going over there and finding apartments and stuff
A	yeah but it's more exciting isn't it
B	yeah it's more exciting than like moving to Cambridge or moving to Oxford or
A	yeah I don't know I quite like being in a position where it's quite I don't know quite scary or quite full on
B	mm
A	Cos it makes you feel alive
B	mm
A	kind of invigorates all of your senses and heightens your perceptions
B	yeah it does feel good
A	whereas here just feel a bit numb
B	I got a little rush when we read the next
A	yeah
B	I got a little
A	yeah well I didn't feel like that when I gave my dissertation in
B	no
A	it's funny cos I remember we all went down the pub with everyone else
B	yeah
A	and we all just sat there like urgh
B	that
A	yeah
B	should have been spread out over the year or something
A	yeah
B	can I have one of those things?
A	quite dark
B	yeah that's the thing I meant
A	what time is it? About eight?
B	mm
A	that's another thing that's going to be different
B	dark?
A	it gets dark earlier doesn't it?
B	does it?
A	I think so
B	they don't have summer time
A	no
B	mm
A	well that's cos we're quite far north really here aren't we
B	yeah
A	the further south you get the darker it gets
B	yeah the shorter the day
A	thirty-one?
B	yeah
A	that's doable
B	but thirty-five
A	okay
B	that's like maximum for me
A	that's like
B	oh I don't think we get to thirty-five do we?
A	er I think so
B	Don't know
A	well what's a hundred?
B	mm
A	I can never remember
B	I don't know
A	is it late thirties or forty or something is it? Don't know
B	Don't know
A	yeah
B	and I'm going to be wearing more clothes
A	yeah well that's going to be a bit of a shock to the system isn't it
B	but hopefully breezy
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah it's not very nice is it
B	my nose was always blocked
A	mm
B	it's alright but some of that stuff is bad isn't it
A	yeah
B	mum wants to play a game
A	er yeah I could do
B	yeah
A	and then yeah I'll be ready
B	yeah
A	well I'll start uploading it and cos it takes ages doesn't it
B	yeah
