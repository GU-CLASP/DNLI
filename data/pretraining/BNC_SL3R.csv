A	so what options are you taking again?
B	I'm doing erm triple science er
A	oh yeah I'm doing triple science as well
B	erm history
A	I'm not doing history
B	music and
A	mm
B	erm
A	French
B	what are you doing?
A	triple science
B	uhu
A	Spanish
B	oh it's I really wanted to do art but I erm
A	yeah I'm really
B	can I have some of this?
A	yeah sure
B	thanks
A	you can have some of that juice yeah
A	erm
B	I know that's probably cos they made the GCSEs harder
A	yeah I know so it's probably for better
B	yeah but still
A	I would have taken geography
B	okay
A	cos I don't have any humanities
B	oh yeah well that's not a problem is it?
A	no it's not
B	well
A	mm
B	you don't need a humanities
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I don't think I don't think I really want to be a geographer
B	what do you want to be?
A	erm probably a designer
B	oh
A	like an industrial designer or an architect probably
B	I don't know
B	probably like
A	I think you should be like a reporter or something
B	or a journalist like
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly
A	you'd do
B	a much better job
A	well I liked
A	well erm
B	I'm gonna
A	talk about lipsticks
B	yeah
A	I never saw that one
B	didn't you?
A	yeah should have
B	mm it was really funny
B	I think she's got no followers still
A	yeah
B	and all of the views were just mine
B	mm
A	yeah it's
B	mm
A	it's really hard to find like
B	mm
A	and people to read your blog because how do people find out about your blog?
B	I don't know
A	unless you're like their friend
B	mm
B	like Zoella
A	yeah
B	but she had loads of people on her blog and that's why
A	yeah that's why she started on YouTube
B	mm
A	yeah
B	she doesn't do her blog the last time I went on her blog like
B	mm
A	mm
B	and she always complained she was like
A	mm she never actually
B	mm
A	does her blog
B	I think
A	yeah especially original things to talk about
B	mm
A	because
B	not just er
A	unless it's like a DIY blog and you have to try and think of
B	mm
A	each week and if it's like a blog like Zoella you have to try to think is
B	mm that
A	like how
B	not everybody's doing
A	yeah exactly cos
B	yeah
A	I think it's probably hard to run a blog
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't
B	well
A	be able to find
B	mm
A	think of enough things to do really
B	yeah I don't think people like bloggers earn that much money
A	mm
B	I think only when she started on Youtube that she could
A	yeah probably cos then each time someone watches it you'll get money basically
B	yeah
A	through adverts
B	she gets like twenty thousand a month or something
A	yeah
B	and and erm the other day I was watching an Emma Blackery video with Luke and erm
A	and didn't she er on
B	it was like Emma and Luke versus stock images or something and it was really funny cos she was putting lipstick on him and he was like I'm Zoella and then she was like I don't think Zoe sounds like that and she was like Alfie Alfie
B	and he had a banana and he was like this is my banana erm
B	cos he went ten million views
B	it was really funny
A	yeah that's basically
B	yeah
A	you just have like
B	they don't even work do they?
A	and favourites and stuff it's like
B	yeah
A	oh this is my favourite lipstick of the month or whatever and it's
B	I know they don't actually do anything
A	it's not very interesting like if you think about it
B	they're like
A	yeah I'm so jealous of their job
B	yeah
A	because
B	they
A	they have to make a video
B	yeah and edit it and be
A	and then have the rest of the week off
B	yeah
A	and you can do whatever you want
B	and
A	you make loads of money
B	yeah
A	like she just like Zoella just
B	you see her vlog she's going shopping
A	yeah yeah she's just getting like personal shopping in Topshop
B	in Topshop
A	I was
B	yeah
A	and like
B	and she's probably spending like two hundred pounds
B	every time she goes in there like every day
A	I'm really jealous of their job
B	yeah but then I'd also feel like I'd get a bit bored
A	yeah so would I
B	and shopping and
A	cos it's really hard to like
B	yeah and then
A	and it's the same with blogs and and Youtube
B	what else do you do for the week?
A	yeah exactly
B	nothing
A	it's boring
B	well apart from
A	like I would
B	mm
A	of just
B	yeah
A	videos for seven weeks
B	yeah
A	yeah and then if you choose to you could do like two videos a week
B	mm
A	but still that's only
B	and none of them actually do
A	yeah exactly
B	Danisnotonfire uploads like once every month
A	yeah
B	and everybody's got a book Louise is bringing out a book it's
A	I know
B	so annoying what
A	it's Life with Louise
B	Dan and Phil
A	or something?
B	Dan and Phil
A	yeah
B	Louise Zoe
A	Zoella
B	Alfie
A	and Alfie's now got a Pointless Book 2
B	Pointless Book 2
A	oh
B	erm who else? erm Connor Franta
A	oh yeah erm
B	Jodie Graceffa
A	yeah
B	Shane Dawson
A	Carrie
B	Tanya Carrie
A	er Fleur
B	Fleur
A	yeah erm I think Emma Blackery wants to
B	yeah like her what's it? one 0 one series
A	yes
B	or something
A	I don't think that's like
B	no
A	gonna work
B	but the
A	the only one I want to read is Carrie's
B	yeah
A	because I think Carrie's would actually be good because
B	yeah
A	yeah she's like
B	well I like Carrie
A	yeah I like Carrie
B	I wish I could meet her
A	yeah I'm also jealous
B	I know even though like
A	of
B	I don't know if I would want
A	and she doesn't even like
B	like her
A	like Carrie or
B	I know
A	watch her videos or anything and then she meets her and it's like oh I loved Carrie so much
B	yeah even though I didn't really like their Blank Space cover I thought it was
A	neither did I
B	especially them like like at the start it was really slow and sort of like
A	yeah and I didn't think the harmonies worked
B	harmonies worked
A	very well and they were like clashing and sort of
B	yeah but it was fine
A	and they were shouting
B	yeah
A	mm
B	to the end they didn't do anything but harmonies
A	yeah exactly
B	it was like mm
A	and some of it's okay like the bridge I think was okay
B	yeah
A	and like there were some other bits which were quite good
B	yeah but not like the beginning or anything and the bit where they were shouting in like the chorus
A	mm like from the beginning they were just shouting the whole time
A	and at the end they were really out of breath because they were shouting
B	yeah
A	I'm just gonna
B	okay
A	yeah
B	like I know they have very powerful voices but
A	yeah I know it's
B	yeah
A	calmer
B	or just by themselves
A	yeah taking it in turns to do a few solos
B	yeah oh
A	mm
B	I think like I'm pretty sure
A	yeah I bet he will
B	he will
A	might
B	yeah
A	well
B	well I was really hoping
A	yeah
B	I was thinking well if you
A	especially Life with
A	even gonna be about?
B	that's basically like
A	yeah
B	cos it she was like there's a section on love there's a section on makeup advice that's literally just
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and love she just split up with her husband
A	she can't I oh I'm really sad that they split up
B	yeah I don't know why they did
B	I don't know why well
A	yeah they seemed really happy
B	but then also
A	yeah I know
A	I don't think she was like
B	they just have a very different
A	I think she was quite
B	like lifestyle
A	mm
B	and she was very like young sort of
A	yeah
B	like
A	I think she was a bit
B	yeah as well yeah
A	yeah and she's always like oh I love a party and
B	yeah
A	all that stuff
B	and she always goes on holiday
A	and
B	yeah with
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I feel sorry for
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so she doesn't really understand
A	yeah at least it's not like they're being happy until she's like
B	yeah
A	and then they
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I've I just I'm waiting for the day when Zoella and Alfie split up
A	split up
B	well Alfie would be like well cos Zoella she was the one that bought the house the million pound mansion
A	mm
B	I know it's absolutely
A	they haven't even given us like a full tour
B	I know
A	and I don't even know what's upstairs
B	it's three storeys high
A	but downstairs
B	isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's huge
A	how
B	it's got like five
A	cos downstairs they have like a living room and another living room
B	mm
A	and it's like open plan
B	an office
A	and a dining room and a
B	yeah it's huge
A	and then they have two storeys of like what
B	I know
B	and they've got a log cabin in the garden
A	yeah I know and they have like that big bubble seat thing
B	yeah
A	and their garden is massive
B	mm
A	what was that? what? she said that to an article?
B	no no she said that in one of her videos she said we've got CCTV all around our house in one article it said that they had cameras everywhere and she also said that cos when Jim went to hers she was like
A	I haven't seen that vlog yet
B	she said erm
A	I wouldn't want to live in such a
B	mm
A	a big house if I was like a big family then okay
B	mm
A	but
B	like
A	yeah
B	they've got a big house
A	yeah they have yeah
B	I'm so jealous of their trampoline
A	their house yeah their
B	mm
A	like that big like front yardy thing
B	yeah that's really cool
A	it's really cool yeah
B	I just well also it would be like scary to have such a big house I wouldn't know what to put in
A	yeah
B	all the rooms
A	yeah I'd be kind of
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I don't think I'd want to like be her because she's so famous that she can't even go into town
A	yeah I know without
B	shopping without getting stopped by about fifty million people
A	mm
B	I don't think I'd want to be famous
A	neither would I
B	I wouldn't mind being sort of like medium
A	medium
B	famous like
A	yeah like
B	being a model or like
A	yeah
B	Carrie
B	Carrie's a bit too famous
A	yeah
B	cos everyone's at stage door
A	yeah well in a way that's quite nice
B	yeah
A	even if you're not famous and you're an actor in musicals there's always
B	mm
A	people at the stage door
B	but then I also feel sorry for all the other actors because
A	yeah
B	they're all there for Carrie and not them
A	yeah
B	or
A	erm yeah also I'd feel really bad cos if you're famous like especially a Youtuber you get loads of mail and gifts and stuff
B	mm
A	and then
B	mm
A	and other things I I'd feel really bad
B	so much tea
A	cos you couldn't use all of it
B	yeah and then I I saw on a picture that did
A	yeah
B	er oh I don't think
A	I
B	got a letter or something
A	yeah
B	written a letter
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	origami
A	yeah like a
A	origami Stitch or
B	mm
A	or something that would be so cool
B	mm
A	origami
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and she gets so much tea and like
A	yeah I know
B	if you see Joe and Caspar's videos
A	cos even something like an origami Stitch
B	yeah
A	if you have millions of them
B	like Joe and Caspar's video people were sending them random like glasses and
A	yeah and like
B	yeah
A	yeah it's just like
B	mm I wouldn't know what to do with it
A	neither would I
B	and I wouldn't be able to read all of those letters so many letters
A	especially like Zoella she gets like two bin bags full
B	yeah
A	a week or something
B	I feel really sorry for like all everyone that's writing letters though also because it's just you read it
A	and there's not really that much
B	they're like oh that's nice
A	possibility that they will actually read it
B	remember
A	or reply or
B	yeah
A	remember it
B	because then you they're like what's your name blah blah blah and then they just forget it they don't remember it
A	yeah
B	cos you're just another
A	they don't remember it
B	and even like
A	or like you meet them again in a week
B	mm
A	you say oh I met you last week they wouldn't remember you
B	they'd be like oh
A	and then they'll be like oh yes I remember you but they don't
B	yeah
A	yeah oh you were on last week
A	there's millions of people they probably wouldn't have
B	yeah
A	remembered
B	all the judges are like oh yeah we remember you really? do you?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah well you can't really expect them to like remember
B	no
B	but that would but that's what would be nice if it was like if you're a smaller Youtuber
A	yeah exactly
B	because then you remember the people you meet
A	yeah
B	but she's started getting
A	she will be bigger
B	more famous now she's got loads of gigs her ukulele broke
A	oh
B	I saw a picture
A	oh no
B	someone dropped a speaker on it
A	who?
B	I dunno I saw it on her Twitter
A	oh
B	cos I was just stalking her
B	and she had a picture and it was oh it was horrible like the this bit here it was crumbled in on itself it was oh and then she tweeted she was like does anyone have an electro acoustic guitar I could borrow for tonight's gig
A	oh
B	so
A	yeah of course oh
B	I'm sure she could have still worked it like
A	yeah I would have well I would have expected her to have like two
B	yeah
A	that's what Ed Sheeran has he has like
B	well she does have two but she was like
A	five
B	somewhere else
A	five er million
B	in Manchester or something
A	yeah
B	and she lives in London but she like oh I dunno she's getting a lot bigger now cos she moved to London and like
A	yeah
B	all her videos are
A	all of the
B	are so much better quality
A	yeah all the famous Youtubers eventually move to London
B	yeah it makes me really sad though because I really like them and I want more of their videos but then they get bigger
A	yeah
B	and more famous and then they
A	and then they're more like professional
B	yeah
A	and they don't do as funny videos
B	and they do ads loads of ads
A	yeah also Emma Blackery
B	yeah cos she's grown up like
A	yeah now her sense of humour I found it I find it really awkward
B	yeah and she's
A	especially
B	not funny anymore
A	yeah I know she's not like before even when she just had like the orange wig
B	mm
A	that I think was her good
B	yeah cos she was so
A	because she was quite good or before that
B	angry and grumpy and I
A	before that
B	yeah
A	and that time she was good
B	and when she changed her hair and everything
A	and she was like angry grumpy and stuff
B	yeah
A	and that was good
B	yeah
A	now she's like really sensible and has a really weird sense of humour
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah
A	so I watched it
A	the sense of humour I don't find funny
B	I know but
A	did you watch it?
B	I did watch it and she was
A	yeah and it's like
B	really slowly in the car and I was like
A	yeah and and she's like mm and like
B	mm
A	her face and then she's
B	yeah
A	and she doesn't seem natural she's like I don't remember my er what I thought of cars maybe I thought you were on fire you know and then she had that thing
B	oh yeah yeah
A	where she was on a skateboard and she puts some fire on her feet
A	oh it's not funny
B	I don't know what she's
A	really awkward
B	still doing with Luke because Luke was perfect for her when she before
A	yeah before
B	but but now she's just really sensible and like
A	I don't like Luke he's really
B	I've
A	I find him really awkward and
B	stupid yeah
A	it's really awkward to
B	and like it's
A	watch his
B	and all he does is put on this really stupid voice and it's so annoying
A	yeah I know
B	and so I can't watch his I try really hard to like his videos cos I liked Emma and then I was I didn't I really like all her old videos
A	yeah so do I
B	the ones where she had like pink hair and like her waitressing
A	yeah
B	videos I thought they were so funny
A	yeah those ones
B	yeah but then
A	yeah
B	she got rid of it
A	yeah all of those ones when she's just angry and grumpy
B	mm were the best ones
A	yeah and now she's like
B	mm
A	channel it's really awkward
B	it is really awkward
A	it seems really weird to see her sensible and like
B	yeah
A	telling you about what lush things she likes and
B	yeah
A	and it's like what?
B	except
A	yeah that would have been
B	mm

A	don't know that
B	one from the book which was Meditation
A	do you want some more juice?
B	no I'm alright I'm fine one from the book which was Meditation and and but Meditation was the new study I got like three weeks before my exam because

B	my other study was like you know the really long phrased one and I just can't
A	oh yeah
B	do them I'm so bad at them
A	I can't do them
B	because I sort of the stop in the middle and I'm like
B	yeah
A	even my the one I ended up doing which doesn't well actually it does have quite long phrases it's so hard
B	it's like it's like
A	at the end I'm like panting
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	it's basically like these I just can't do these
A	yeah
B	or
A	but at least
B	I did the romance
A	but that was basically like one massive phrase oh
B	and it was so long it was two pages
B	it's so annoying and then I remember in my exam I was so hot I wish I'd taken my blazer off I was sweating
A	I took my blazer off
B	so much

A	mm
B	I don't know how I did that
A	I didn't get the clapping wrong
B	you got the time wrong I got the time right
A	mm
B	and I got the clapping wrong
A	I was so annoyed about that cos I knew it and I should have just said
A	oh no sorry I meant three time but instead I just stayed quiet
B	mm
A	idiot
B	well it's fine cos you still got a merit
A	yeah
A	maybe
B	I think I'm not my pieces weren't normally my pieces are good and my scales are awful but this time
A	that was what happened
