B	so I wouldn't
A	it's so unfair though that it goes on your parents cos I'm not being funny or anything but
C	mm
B	yeah
A	so if they didn't get paid that much money they wouldn't have
C	mm
B	yeah
A	if they don't get paid a lot and live to their means
B	so I know
A	so
C	yeah it is
A	yeah
C	uni and stuff like
B	yeah
C	it is bad
A	and it's not your parents who are gonna pay your loan back it's you
B	yeah I know
A	and when you're eighteen
B	shouldn't be about anything to do with your parents cos like
A	yeah
B	like this is her house so it's like
A	yeah
C	yeah you get more don't you? yeah yeah yeah
A	then I get the full whack
B	yeah

B	yeah
A	cos overtime is not
C	yeah
A	reliable income there's not always gonna be overtime
C	yeah
