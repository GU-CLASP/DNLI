A	so when we cook is this from memory?
B	yeah this is actually a recipe I just made up
A	oh
B	and I normally do it with lamb and but we have beef so
A	when I do potatoes with curry for like the customer I get lazy with peeling them if they're small potatoes
B	yeah
A	cut them and boil them
B	it's a bit of a pain in the bum
A	is it that bad? and then with the skin on them
B	erm depending on what you're eating if I just had mashed potato I'd actually prefer it with skin on it but not all of the skin I'd probably cut off like half of the skin and then when I mash it it's got the skin in it it's good it's got more flavour and then the more nutrients are usually in the skin
A	yeah but surely it's like a darker colour?
B	yeah well like what I'm making today I probably I don't want to leave any of the skin and the mash potato I'm going to make with erm ginger and red onions and erm
A	sounds good
A	ah
B	they're really nice
A	I don't actually like those ones that much this is my favourite
B	because they're difficult to clean?
A	yeah
B	which ones?
A	these big ones
B	ah yeah they're cool
A	yeah I know
B	I guess they cooked last night we should've washed up
A	huh?
B	you washed up last night didn't you so I guess you left it
A	ah yeah I left that one
B	it doesn't soak
A	yeah
B	I never really wash up at home
A	does
A	oh
B	we just leave it drain
A	cooking's more interesting
B	erm I do wash up though I mean quite often as well I'm cooking when
A	yeah
B	but then she never cooks
A	does she never cook?
B	no not really
A	so she knows how to cook
B	yeah
A	she just chooses not
B	and I mean saying she never cooks is a lie because she always cooks with me she's like
A	yeah
B	I'm in charge of like well I just go along with the recipe I know what's going on but I just tell her what to do you know
A	oh
B	she's good at making she's good at baking and she like makes the bread and stuff
A	with
B	yeah
A	yeah she's cool
B	you got along?
A	yeah
A	she's a nice girl
B	this is just a pain in the arse this
A	you should use the metal
B	yeah I was using it I think I'm just going to leave that for now and have another go
A	it's going to need doing though eventually
B	oh this thing
A	yes
A	no you you did because when you left you were kind of skinny and then you came back and you were quite buff
B	yeah
A	and then you went travelling erm to India or no it was to
B	it's the last time I came back I was kind of muscly
A	no the last time when you came back from erm America South America you were
B	but now I'm more muscular
A	well also yeah
B	I can't get much bigger it's kind of sad doesn't matter how much I work out this is just about as big as I get I don't eat protein shakes or anything I don't I guess I just ate more probably this is just my natural build
A	yeah
B	but like when we're travelling a lot I wasn't really eating that much and I was doing a lot of exercise so that was probably not a natural
A	yeah so like how much exercise were you doing?
B	right the
A	just like when you were in your peak
B	four to five hours a week
A	that's quite a lot
B	erm
A	is that ah every day or every other day?
B	I tried to do weekdays and I do an hour a day
A	yeah
B	erm but I mean at my peak it could have been more because
A	yeah
B	it's not as strenuous as like you know weights or something but it's not it's not too easy so I don't know but on average i'd say four to five hours a week probably go running once or twice or hiking and then go to the gym a couple of times
A	so you do ah free weights at the gym?
B	yeah
A	that's what I need to do
B	ah it's cheap anyway isn't it?
A	it's not that cheap it's cheap compared to like a
B	the one in
A	yeah it's about the same
B	that's well cheap
A	it is cheap
B	I mean it's less than a pound a day
A	yeah
B	it's still a hundred and eighty quid but
A	yeah
B	I mean even if you go twice a week
A	yeah
B	no no no sorry
A	no it would be more
B	fifty-two weeks so fifty-two goes into a hundred and eighty about three and a half times
A	uhu
B	but you're not going to be there all the weeks are you? how close is the gym to where you're living?
A	ah I don't know
B	yeah worth finding out
A	yeah
B	for sure
A	erm
B	right so the first thing we need to do is get the bread
A	are we going to need a saucepan?
B	we're going to need a whole bunch of things but not immediately do you want to help me with the bread?
A	yeah sure
B	could've made breadcrumbs
A	nah I didn't
B	or burgers or anything? have you ever made a burger?
A	ah maybe once
B	it's the same kind of thing really
A	okay
B	with the breadcrumbs
A	why?
B	I feel like it the germs kind of stay on it
A	yeah I don't actually chop on this do you know?
B	I mean I'll use it I haven't got a problem
A	saying that I don't actually
A	it's good enough
B	it's quite small though isn't it?
A	yeah
B	sure we're going to have to do it in stages alright first things first do you want to help me de-crust? is there a bowl as well? where's like a big bowl?
A	I'll take all the breadcrumbs
B	may need to
A	really?
B	do you want to help me de-crust?
A	yeah sure
B	so just take the crust off of these
A	so we're only wanting the crust?
B	no we don't want the crust
A	oh why did you buy crusty bread then?
B	I mean can you buy a loaf of bread without the crust?
A	you can
A	they sell it they just chop the crust off
B	ah never seen it?
A	ah
B	never heard of it
A	I'm pretty sure that Hovis and all them do that
B	ah that this was like forty pence or something i've been quite impressed since i've come home about how cheap the food is it's not cheap cheap but like you go in Lilds it's pretty cheap compared to
A	where are we putting? have we got to break up this?
B	yeah
A	I'm just joking with you
B	this is some shitty bread
A	yeah
A	this one's really dry
B	it should be dry a loaf of bread
A	yeah
B	no
A	in a traditional sense
B	what's the traditional sense?
A	well I think like they use enzymes to partially break down the bread so it's easier to digest
B	oh ok
A	but these are really manufactured and just not good
B	I try not to eat much bread
A	yeah me too
B	in general I never
A	mm
B	I prefer corn tortillas though
B	what's so funny?
B	they're tasty
A	when you're complaining about that I know that wasn't
B	what?
A	the the crap we've got in the freezer
B	no that's quorn with a Q Q U O R N it's like some weird I'm not even sure what that is
A	ah ok
B	corn as in like corn you know maize they use it to
A	yeah
B	now what I normally do with these is make a bunch like I've just done now it's just too much and then I freeze it
A	mm
B	so then I just take a handful and then I leave it
A	mm
B	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah I mean once you've frozen it it will keep for six months
A	you could use it quicker than that
B	right cool a lot of breadcrumbs should we quickly clean this side
A	what are you going to do if you submit your recordings and they're like ah actually this one has swearing in it we can't take it?
B	can't accept it
B	ah shit
A	mm
B	mum have like a Dustbuster thing actually is that this?
A	yes
B	I'll just
A	uhu
B	okay
A	what's?
B	hands clean?
A	yeah what's next?
B	right
A	sure
B	first thing we want to do is make ah let's make the burgers should we just do everything together?
A	okay
B	this is going to take a little bit longer than
A	yes
B	you got time?
A	yeah
B	like an hour or something?
A	that one that I showed you a minute ago is that big enough?
A	I've got bigger bowls in here
B	hang on a minute there might be something in here yeah there's a mixing bowl in here
A	they just got
B	oh it's got a weird little spike in the middle
A	no good I'm just going to get a big bowl out here
B	just the bigger the bowl
A	here you go
B	you got one? is it ridiculous?
A	it's too big
B	cool right do you want to chop
A	yeah it's good today
B	which one is the real knife?
A	this one
B	there's a cleaver here
A	erm this is the one I'm allowed to take to uni so I might as well get good at it
B	oh you're allowed to take?
A	well the other knives they use
B	yeah
A	so this one
B	I take it they don't keep the eggs in the fridge?
A	no
B	cool
A	ah man
B	what's wrong with it?
A	a massive piece of shell went into it
B	oh
B	okay
A	how finely chopped do you want these?
B	not at all they're going to be blended
A	okay
B	just chop them into little bits not like too small just so they fit in the blender
A	that's loud
B	yeah that is so loud isn't it?
A	was that just one egg?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	probably should have just used the egg white whatever where's the light in here is this it?
A	we've got a light here
B	oh nice
A	yep
B	very good you got any olive oil?
A	ah yes
B	light olive oil
A	the one behind the
B	cool
A	these are ready to go in the blender
B	right stick them in the blender then
A	does it matter that there's still bread there?
B	no not really because the
B	right hang on one second are you ready?
A	uhu
B	okay so we've got the onion have you got the parsley?
A	yeah I'm working on it
B	cool and add the onion to this so just blend the onion up until it's nice and fine
A	mm
B	not dissimilar at all
A	so taking the egg just makes it all stick together
B	yeah then the breadcrumbs the egg sticks it together but it also makes it a bit
A	yeah
B	we're gonna want this blender again in a bit
A	I don't know
B	I think it's called a fruit processor
A	what's the difference?
B	this is a blender it blends
A	yeah
B	whereas processors it like chops it differently
A	oh
B	so these are more heavy duty than these they'd make a smoothie and something else in this very cool what else are we going to put in this?
A	yeah
B	put in the cumin in there maybe bit of paprika
unknown_female	is that paprika?
A	Does it matter if there's a few stalks in it?
B	no mate just chop it up as small as you can
A	okay
B	put in a bit of salt and pepper
A	yeah I like it
B	yeah
A	and it's rubbish
B	oh this tastes like crap
A	yeah
B	where would the salt and pepper be bro?
A	ah salt and pepper
B	oh forgot there was a lid on it
A	it's good salt
B	is it yours?
A	yeah
B	you've got like the fanciest salt around
A	uhu
B	have you not eaten anything?
A	no
B	you can take a break and then grab some food
A	there's not really much to grab
B	is there not? we've got apples
A	yeah I might have some fruit
B	there's yogurt
A	well how long do you think this is going to take to cook?
B	going to be a little while but you can do that while I'm getting on with something else
A	this is for dinner isn't it? not lunch
B	yeah this is for dinner
A	I'm going to have to do lunch then
B	cool
A	don't know yet maybe do an omelette
B	I had a sausage sandwich earlier it was good there's two more sausages left if you want
A	maybe
B	ah there's plenty of bacon
A	that's pretty big
B	yeah man
A	alright is this cut up enough?
B	yeah man sure looks good
A	okay do you want to do that
B	yeah cool
B	oh definitely
A	yeah
B	five hundred grams should be enough for the three of us shouldn't it?
A	I can eat five hundred grams on my own
B	yeah but I mean we're having quite a lot of sauce and we're going to have some peppers with mashed potatoes though
A	ah should be okay
B	got me worried
A	yeah
B	I was tempted when I go over Dad's to see if he's got any lemongrass and
A	I think he will do
B	because if he has and I think he has then we might be able to do one before we go
A	yeah
B	erm it's you don't really want it to be very chewy but I mean if we left it for a day it'd be alright
A	oh
B	is that as big as it comes? is there no other ones?
A	we've got a wok if that'll do?
B	no I need flat
A	right it's flat as it comes
B	is that all there is?
A	erm do we have one in the eh
B	nope
A	must have taken it with them
B	they've taken it?
B	oh bugger that's no good
A	unless you can wait
A	yeah that's no good
B	yeah so you're making bacon?
A	I'll do bacon eggs I'll put some veg in and make some kind of omelette
B	cool
A	what do you think of the tea?
B	yeah it's good I like it actually got the brain good good
A	it does look like a brain
B	yeah
A	yes time's going to fly by down there
B	it really is going to fly by isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's good that you've got your accommodation agreement
A	yeah
B	that's a relief it's quite exciting when you get that kind of information
A	yeah
B	yeah well when you got back? when you got back from
A	yeah and I got
B	did you get the grades you were hoping for in the end? what was your final grade?
A	ah like ninety percent
B	ah I need that celery mate
A	all of it?
B	yeah I need all of it
A	oh bugger
B	I didn't know you were going to use it
A	no I don't have to use it
B	erm no I don't you can use the stalk
A	one?
B	yeah use one how much does that leave me with? there's no leaves on this thing is there what's that all about? how much does that leave?
A	you've got like ah four stalks
B	okay yeah you can use one is that alright?
A	yeah
B	well I'm glad I caught you
A	you can have some of this if you want?
B	you might want to stick an extra rasher in you know I did have a sausage sandwich but it was about three or four hours ago
A	I'll just put a bunch of eggs in I'm going to make this how I make it it's not especially tasty
B	ah I'm sure it's good mate
A	I actually mix it in with rice as well
B	cool whatever you've made if I could just have a little bit of it I'll be pleased
A	right
B	what's your favourite thing that you cook?
A	probably the curries at the moment
B	yeah?
A	when they go well they're quite nice
B	I need chilli now to make a proper proper sauces once you know how to do it it's easy you just need the ingredients
A	yeah
B	and once you buy a pack of tamarind you only need a little bit so you've got like loads of tamarind
A	yeah I did try and
A	like that special galangal or whatever it's
B	galangal
A	galangal
B	as I said just replace it with erm ginger
A	yeah
B	it's basically the same thing it's a type of ginger
A	it's just a special type of ginger?
B	but it still tastes fine I could never get peanut oil you know or coconut oil
A	coconut oil is easy to get here
B	yeah it's not in erm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and I think it's kind of tasty so
B	it is tasty isn't it?
A	sometimes I'll have leek as well
B	yeah leek's good
A	no
B	like they cut the tops and the heads off
A	yeah
B	in Korea and I I found one day do you like cilantro? coriander?
A	yeah kind of
B	I googled one day I didn't have coriander and I was like what could you use instead of coriander? and this guy
A	oh
B	and I started doing it it's really flavoursome cos normally actually when I make this meatballs dish I don't use the stalks of celery I use the leaves
A	mm
B	with a bit of the stalk they're quite pungent
A	I've never tried it
B	it's good and they don't sell them here so
A	why cos I?
B	travelling mature student knows how to cook
A	perhaps we'll see
B	yeah definitely
A	mm
B	if you get out there and start cutting up real ingredients and stuff
B	really impressed
A	people grow up pretty quickly at uni they all come in with their Pot Noodles
B	yeah basically
A	yeah I have
B	he showed me like er he lives in
A	yeah
A	yeah our our parents never taught us to cook
B	no
B	it's a terrible life skill not to not to teach you
A	it's cos they couldn't cook
B	yeah
A	plain and simply
B	if you can't cook how are you gonna cook someone else teach someone else to cook
A	exactly
B	you can't
A	that's why we never learned ambition from them
B	no
A	yeah
B	what was that all about? told her she was a bad parent or something?
A	no I wasn't saying that I was just saying like
B	well don't talk about it if you don't want to
A	we were having a discussion like about childhood and
B	yeah
A	and I was saying to her how like she never taught me to cook or er because she was never ambitious like we didn't really get pushed to be ambitious either
B	no
A	and like I was like well you can't really teach kids things that you yourself do not possess and I suppose I was just having a bit of a moan
B	yeah
A	or whatever cos er we had a lot of shit
B	we had a lot of good things as well though
A	we had some good things yeah
B	I mean we did
A	yeah
B	so no you can't say that she didn't try
A	I know she I'm pretty sure that she always did what she thought was best
B	mm but like erm what you were talking about with being ambitious? I'm actually glad personally that our parents didn't push us too much because I have friends now that they don't really have a very adult relationship with their parents because they
A	mm
B	whereas like I dunno
B	mm
B	just obviously obviously you can tell your mum how you feel obviously but just remember that she'll carry that
A	yeah
B	she'll remember it
A	but the thing is like through a lot of my childhood I was depressed
B	yeah
A	like after they'd split up and I didn't really have a good time
B	I mean you say a lot of your childhood but they split up when you were thirteen or twelve?
A	yeah
B	you were a man by the time you were eighteen so
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
A	like things went bad and then they never really got better
B	yeah well it's a combination isn't it?
A	yeah
B	but now you're out the other side now and you just have to be pleased that you came out the other side
A	yeah
B	you're okay
A	it took me time like
B	yeah
A	for me to get my shit together
B	but that's alright everyone does things at slightly different ages I was lucky I personally at the time it happened I could've gone one of two ways I could've just spiralled out been some
A	yeah
B	erm but thankfully I didn't I went to uni and it helped quite a bit
A	it's just I didn't have any direction
B	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	in the west it's up to us isn't it the parents can't tell you what to do and I'm sure if mum had told you and the thing is mum did try and
A	yeah
B	you were addicted to the computers it's an addiction no one blames you for that because you used it as a crutch I
A	where's the? erm
B	it should be in that drawer there
A	you have to open it
B	what a retard
A	a little bit
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	does bother me that she seems to be making some of the same mistakes with
A	they try and control it like
B	yeah I know they do
B	no it's crap
A	probably
B	hope they don't like divorce or anything that's just going to be another wrecked family
A	you can't do anything
B	it's people's life to live isn't it?
A	people's mistakes to make
B	yeah and they'll keep making them that's smelling good
A	yeah I will do
B	what time are you? are you going to eat then when you get back?
A	might just have a snack first
B	well
A	okay will I sort my own myself some food then?
B	are you done with this chopping board? can I chop some lemons?
A	ah
B	yeah if you're not
A	I can peel some mushrooms and eh
B	ah shit you put mushrooms in it
A	do you not like mushrooms?
B	no I'll pick around them
A	well I'll put them away then
B	I mean most no no put them in most of this is yours anyway I'll just have
A	yeah sure
B	say that I did have a sausage sandwich but it was a while ago
A	I've had two bananas today that's it
A	yeah
B	so with this sauce now I'm just going to add in raw tomato and blend it in with the onion and raw garlic stuff like that I mean if you just give me another chopping board I could
A	oh yeah
B	badly?
A	never badly but it's unpleasant
A	you don't like mushrooms at all do you?
B	no but that's fine I mean if you can leave them bigger so I can quickly pick them out I mean I get around mushrooms all the time but if if you like make them really
B	I can eat them but I don't I just choose not to
B	you can do it quarters that's fine
A	these need using or they're going to go off because I don't think you're going to use them
B	no
A	I saw the mushrooms that are kind of like jellyfish
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	kind of ridiculous
A	we seem to be lucky with the weather today but I think summer's almost over
B	is September normally nice? I don't remember
A	it's okay
B	not terrible
A	no
B	oh this is one thing I don't miss
A	mm
A	well
B	you just squish it
A	yeah
B	yeah thanks
B	easily done
A	it seems to work
B	yeah it does oh something's gone in my eyes now
A	you need a big chopper
B	yeah
A	soon
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	kind of worker out alright
A	I wonder how long it's going to take them to get to eh to
B	yeah I know when are they meant to be there by?
A	I feel sorry for them
B	yeah
A	that's going to be so boring
B	it's not actually that long though when I asked them how long the actual journey was I was quite surprised I thought it would be longer once they're over the ferry it's about seven hours' drive
A	that's not too bad
B	no seeing as I mean it's like a five hour drive to
A	yeah
B	yeah I thought so too
A	mm and then they've got to get down to southern
B	I don't rightly know
A	oh no I don't think I've got any rice
B	just have it without
A	yeah it's just not
A	I've put three in already
B	I mean I could eat two eggs I'm sure you can eat three eggs couldn't you?
A	gets really eggy though
B	yeah it's lovely
