E	why you need to get
A	ah well

A	we we we've bought although I daren't tell him when because
D	not that soon not that soon at all
A	erm
E	horseradish
D	mm that's what we need to get
A	I'll need to get the er kitchen stuff sorted out

E	so yeah we get to look at your place later grandpa we'll get to look at your place properly
B	yeah
A	that's what
D	beautiful mm
A	er
D	mm
A	got the gas electric water
D	oh that wine's gorgeous
A	council tax
D	mm
A	voting telephone
C	all that fun stuff
A	the bins everything else is now registered erm in his name
C	mm
D	he has got bins
A	erm so I've managed to do the whole lot the only thing I haven't done yet is Sky erm we've even got the boiler service
C	oh wow
D	mm
A	updated his his he has er one of those the ones you see advertised on the TV
C	yeah
D	mm
A	he has one of those but we've gone onto the top one to add in
D	mm
A	fix the electrics plus kitchen appliances
D	mm
A	just cost him eighty-seven pence a month more
C	that's good
A	that's all
E	did they
A	er it's twenty something pounds a month
A	no which covers obviously gas boiler
D	mm
A	service every year erm
E	that's really good actually
A	any
D	and it should be cheaper to live yeah
E	really?
A	mm
D	mm
D	is it within so
A	no well let's face it
D	mm
D	mm
A	still fixed it
D	mm
A	replaced it
E	erm you know my outside tap?
D	mm
E	it's just dripping I just can't stop it dripping
D	mm
E	I can't get it to fix no matter how hard I turn the tap and how hard I turn
D	mm
E	that thing onto it it
D	mm
A	mm
E	we do need to contact the erm the aftercare team anyway cos our back doors are catching they catch it on the frame and on the floor
D	mm
E	they're just like two millimetres too high no too low for the floor and no sorry one millimetre too low for the floor
D	mm
E	the
D	mm
E	and two
A	well this is why when I remember I asked you about it being where the bolts go in at an offset angle?
E	yeah
A	I'm thinking this isn't quite right when I was there so
E	mm and erm
D	it's this signing off before you move in
C	mm
D	this signing off before you move in
E	oh yeah
D	is ludicrous
C	I know
D	you need to live in the space
C	well the thing is technically apparently now we're at an advantage cos cos we go through customer care it effectively gets like escalated
D	mm
C	and they can draft in erm site
D	mm
C	erm whereas if we went to our site manager he could only draft people on that was on his like
D	mm
C	and only as and when they were available
D	mm
C	he couldn't pull them off other jobs for example
D	no
C	so it kind of just gets like left cos it's not a priority
D	yeah
C	mm
D	beautiful gravy
E	it's lovely
D	mm
A	so how is it little homeowners?
E	it's good

D	mm
C	I'm gonna test run the train at some point next month just to see what it's like
D	mm
E	obviously that's gone up three percent whatever
D	mm
E	so it wasn't financially it wasn't er an advantage financially before and now it's gone up three percent
D	mm
E	and it's just definitely not is it?
D	yeah
A	have you

D	yeah
E	you did? last week?
A	mm
D	yeah and then er it wasn't father
A	it was
D	when
D	that happens
D	no just happens sort of
A	it was about twenty past eight yeah
D	yeah
D	it happens cos you hand over your
E	to who?
A	to the server
D	to the church
A	to the church
D	to the church to the server

A	is he the old guy with white hair?
D	but he's yeah yeah
A	oh I've er
D	he's lovely isn't he?
A	mm
D	I think he used to have our black car you know when we had the Mondeo? there was a retired reverend from
A	yeah
D	I think it's him
A	you need to ask him did you ever live in
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	erm
A	yes darling
C	my mum wants to sort her bed out in September her flower bed
C	her flower bed that you offered
A	yep
C	she's got a week off around
E	twentieth
C	twentieth or something erm
C	and she wondered whether you would er
D	mm
A	er yeah we'll have a pop down and have a look
C	okay it's it's not very big is it? it
C	it won't take much at all but she just doesn't have a clue
D	does
E	garage garage door there rose bush
C	I think she just wants something easy but something that will look pretty
D	yeah
E	probably needs to be cut down to regrow but as it is at the moment it
C	yeah
A	come up with something
E	a lot of weeds and
D	do you like the dahlias? you see they're still going aren't they? but
C	yeah they're really nice I just think she wants something that's gonna be relatively easy to maintain
D	yeah
C	but will look nice
A	well that that unfortunately is an annual thing because obviously I grow those from seed
C	yeah
A	but they will form tubers I dig them up make sure they dry off alright and then you get through the winter okay they'll start shooting in the spring and I put them back in but slugs and snails love them
C	mm
D	yeah
E	so yeah your your mum wants some things that she can just pop in there which will come back every year absolutely fine and then I think she'd be happy with bedding plants going in once a year
D	yeah
A	I mean you know
C	a couple of
C	er maybe like some sort of like bushier type things that are just gonna fill it up a little bit
D	ceanothus
E	no no you don't want bushy stuff because no because they get too big like your front garden did and like the stuff in the back did
C	okay but okay perhaps not quite to that scale but just something that's gonna like fill it out a little bit
E	er it's a bit like er it's a bit like
E	and she's not interested
D	mm
C	no
E	it's she's not interested in gardening
C	she wants something easy
D	yeah
C	but it's it's currently got a lot of weeds in it so
A	who's
D	who's
E	I said
D	wants something easy
E	well er
D	our
E	oh I said yes I don't know any other
A	well neither do I that's what I thought and I thought

E	was it?
A	yeah
D	oh yeah she didn't empty the filter
E	you did you ask if she had?

C	mm

D	I know it was perfect there

C	neither of us have been feeling like a hundred percent recently have we?
D	haven't you?
E	no I've been really
D	cos of this?
C	yeah it was really bad
A	you but you were but you obviously you were okay? you got you picked your paperwork up or mum dropped it off
C	yeah he's in on Tuesday
A	you okay with that?
D	when do you stop eating?

E	one P M one P M tomorrow I can't eat again till I've had it done quarter past four is when I go in
C	mm
E	I have to take these sachets tomorrow night
E	and it basically says you will not be off the toilet
E	for like er three three hours
E	then I've gotta take them again
D	that's beautifully written
C	oh no it says stay near a toilet
C	I just kept laughing yesterday when I was reading it
E	yeah they're they're just brutally honest
C	yeah
D	do you want company when you're on the toilet? put
C	put
C	I've told him that he has to pick one toilet and stay near that toilet cos I'm not having him like infect all three toilets
D	oh
E	I think by the end of it you just pass nothing
A	isn't that isn't that nice in your first house to say in all three toilets?
C	er
D	we had two yeah
C	it is an
A	in fact the first one we actually had an outside one
E	yeah

A	we had to share with the next door neighbour
D	our neighbour I know
D	yeah they did
A	three toilets oh wonderful
D	oh third toilet
A	but no you're right he he needs to stick with one

C	I know fluid
E	fluid
A	yeah
E	water
D	yeah
E	it won't even be fluid it'll just be water won't it?
A	water yeah
D	it's so big and substantial the downstairs you could live in there
D	for twenty-four hours I'd've thought
A	with
D	with
C	I don't think it's gonna be very fun
D	oh it's beautiful
A	I'll just go and fill that water up for them
D	yeah it's so lovely with that community of sparrows did you know they're on the decrease?
A	we've got a whole community of

D	for the sparrows
D	roosting yeah
A	yeah we've got three of them in there
D	yeah
E	full full of sparrows
C	it's really random they've got absolutely no awareness of things like cars that can kill them and they just chill out in the middle of the road
E	they pick stones from the road
A	yes
E	and they there all the time I've only ever seen one dead sparrow though
C	I think everybody's quite accommodating of them they'll slow down and like beep and whatever
A	I think I think the majority the majority of people do slow down
D	yeah oh yeah
C	you didn't you kill one
E	no
D	got a squirrel
A	oh yeah

A	I
A	I won't touch them because
C	yes
D	we've got our lives ahead of us haven't we?
C	and actually he er he might he won't be anywhere near as distracted as he's been the last few times he's visited cos he's actually can actually relax a little bit
A	I think his results are out your birthday week
D	birthday week my birthday week
A	yeah
D	yes do you want some more gravy pop?
B	no no no I'm alright
D	you're alright? yeah?
B	mm
C	I'm sure he needn't worry he'll have to let us know all about his plans I think
E	oh yeah I never get I never get
C	I'm so
C	I'm so intrigued I want to hear more about it
D	she'll be the she's the project manager
A	what? for the the house on the left? yeah
D	for for the house build
A	yeah
C	surely I'm I swear they're gonna have to buy a er build a bungalow
E	build a bungalow
C	because that cos it er it's
C	I'm
E	so there's there's they'll be next they'll be across the lane from their cottage in the back garden of a bungalow next to a bungalow so there's two bungalows there
A	yeah
E	they won't
C	I don't really
E	they won't be able to have any window space in
C	I'm taking all my knowledge from Grand Designs
A	all all
A	sorry they
D	I like
E	the the the guy from
C	oh yeah yeah
D	from the North East that's why I like
E	from from
C	but erm the one who likes er all the fascinating spaces and all that kind of yeah
D	yeah
A	but they they start off they start off with a building plot
E	yeah
A	okay it's brown site so it's brown field cos it's in a within a residential area so it's not new
D	excuse me
C	mm
A	however as you've just
E	yeah
C	mm
D	of
A	of
C	yeah
A	that's what I mean
E	well it would be on his on his land
A	that's what I mean
E	er yeah
A	but anybody in the area can object now the only people that tend to get
D	no I
E	there's only one where's the other one?
A	what's that?
E	one chicken
C	they hang out like in the sunflowers and wherever else that's they've been all over the place
A	erm so really it's hard it's hard to say it is more than likely they would only allow a bungalow
C	yeah
A	but if nobody objects
C	it might be okay I can't quite get my head round where what what bit they mean
D	I don't know
E	you know where the gate is into theirs? near near the actual house
D	yeah
D	mm
E	no no no
A	no no no no
C	the other end?
D	mm
A	near the extension
C	near the actual
A	yeah
C	near the actual house?
A	yeah
D	there is
C	yeah
D	yeah the one you go through to go and see the alpaca
C	the land
D	yeah is that where it is?
C	like where the chickens and like down from where the chickens are?
E	so
C	yeah
E	on the right-hand side if you're walking towards the chickens
C	yeah
D	mm
A	so it's
C	yeah
A	cottage is here
C	yeah
A	there's a bungalow there
E	mm
A	and alpacas are there
C	yeah
D	there's some land in there
E	mm
A	it's
C	okay
A	it's like chopping the back off
C	yeah
E	weird
C	that's quite a commitment
D	you know where
C	I think it's onto the lane
A	it's it's onto the lane
D	is it?
C	yeah
A	that's the whole garden
E	cos they've got a lane that splits the two bungalows as well
C	and er yeah they've got a lane that goes right round
D	uhu
A	yeah
D	mm
C	mm
D	you know er where the where their cottage is? you know the other cottage the people in that cottage?
A	I
E	no
D	no
E	er he owns he owns half of that
D	half of?
A	he owns yeah so he owns the cottage
D	oh okay
C	mm
A	I don't think I think this whole thing is so they don't leave
C	yeah it's it's it ties them down for er
D	well a few years
C	well because the thing is it is one of those things it's like obviously part of the condition is that they can only sell it back to
E	yeah
C	which is a bit dangerous really isn't it?
A	yeah
D	yeah
E	so if they decide to sell it that's fine sell it to him
D	uhu
A	well obviously as long as that is er as long
D	it's something to do with inheritance tax
A	yeah
C	oh okay
A	it's at a fair market price
E	well I presume it will be
A	yeah but they have to have that written in put in writing
C	yeah
E	yeah
D	it's all to do with inheritance tax
A	because you know at the end of the day and although you don't like to say this if something happened to and I know it's all very incestuous the way it is but if something happened to
D	mm
A	who they sell it to
C	yeah
A	er although
D	I think
A	yeah
D	I don't think
C	well that's but that's the awkward thing to look at
C	exactly
C	if if something happens and they decide to break up
A	he can't sell
C	he can't sell the house
D	I know
A	he can't get
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	she wouldn't cos it's on her
A	I think it's an appalling idea
C	yeah
A	but er that's not up to me
C	I think they've
D	yeah
C	and have er er I imagine over dinner at some point somebody's mentioned it as a bit of a joke and it's just been
D	he's
C	oh okay
A	yeah but it's all yeah but but the
C	mm maybe
A	yeah but it's the point is when you're talking about inheritance inheritance
D	it's difficult
A	inheritance tax
D	mm
A	to
A	so fine so
D	all they're helping all the
E	oh shut up
D	oh sorry it's
E	have you even spoken to them about it?
D	no
E	cos you're talking like
E	so none of you have actually spoken to them about it?
A	I have
A	I had over half an hour on the phone talking about it
E	why are you missing feathers round your face?
D	oh are you talking?
A	well I think it's because they actually haven't got feathers round their now you're gonna have to watch it
E	why?
D	cos they're they're bold and this is a new carpet
D	she comes into the utility don't want her to come into where you
A	they come and they come and lick
D	very bold she's very very bold thank you thank you
E	who's that? that's
D	now then we're just thinking dad
B	yeah?
D	we might pop down and have a look at the bungalow
B	yes
D	what do you think?
B	oh
D	okay? there is a there is a pudding but
D	when we transferred ovens it went in the top oven and the grill was on not the oven so the top's a bit burnt so
D	we'll give it a break and we'll come back when we're a bit more hungry it's the sort of pudding you've got to be hungry to eat
D	it's quarter to three
A	oh yeah no problem
