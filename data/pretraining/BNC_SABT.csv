A	okay
B	it was the fire alarm
A	okay
B	well the fire alarm's got a heat sensor so it's not really the smoke
A	no
B	which we know cos we filled the house with smoke recently
A	well
B	and it didn't set the alarm off
A	no
B	erm
A	I think
B	yeah
A	what do you mean?
B	like maybe like proper
A	ah like black smoke not like bit of chicken that you've left on a bit long
B	death smoke
A	yeah
B	er what's on the TV tonight then?
A	erm I think is MasterChef not on? Because it's not on on a Friday because like prime time television's on on a Friday
B	er I don't normally watch it on Friday I don't think
A	oh is it? No it's not on
B	but it  but it  is on quite a few days
A	mm mm
B	it's on like Monday Tuesday or Wednesday or something isn't it
A	because it was like before it was the erm the real ones
B	oh right yeah so it's just like oh yeah the the general public
A	but like they've totally changed the form haven't they because like do you remember when it was Lloyd Grossman? And it was just like three people standing behind like some plywood
B	yeah I remember those ones
A	the the set?
B	the the the set was sort of dark and like
A	I remember the music
B	the kitchens were the the kitchens were they had little kitchens arranged in a sort of a
A	no wasn't there three of them? Oh yeah
B	they used to sort of walk around erm in the blackness sort of going from the kitchen to little kitchen to little kitchen and er
A	he's funny
B	I don't know
B	he makes  he makes  the sauces doesn't he? He makes the
A	well did you hear about that sauce though like? One of his sauces like
A	honestly
B	so no no look
A	yeah yeah
B	you mean that someone died eating the the sauce yeah
A	no no no no
B	yeah like salmonella or something
A	I don't know I'll have to google it
B	so someone  so someone  died at one of his
A	I don't know like
B	and someone ate that and and died of and er
A	I think it was pasta sauces
B	he'd have to do  he'd have to do  where they'd have to be destroyed so he'd have to lots of mini impressions of himself being burnt so it would be quite
A	like like a pyre of Lloyd Grossman sauces
B	it it will be quite upsetting erm to see all those mini mes being sort of burnt
A	well but I'm sure it I'm sure it's Lloyd Grossman
B	one of something like that yeah
A	anyway but yeah I think Masterchef's on
B	erm
A	but the thing is though unless
B	er
A	mm
B	that kind of explosion of cooking recently
A	oh good them them horrible baker boys
B	I've seen them
A	they're so annoying
B	they're sort of two little Gordon Ramseys or something
A	no they're not even like that
B	I think it's quite fake
A	and they're living this like they in this idyllic place where just like he's the butcher and I'm the baker and my other sister's the candlestick maker or something
B	well they're  they're living  they're living the
A	well I think it's just bull
B	yeah
A	anyway what I was saying originally
B	well yeah it does look  a bit  a bit fake actually yeah
A	what I was saying before about MasterChef was like
B	his his name for the record is John Torode
A	no it's not it's Jonty
B	yeah it's more like er something that would have Arnold Schwarzenegger rather than like than sort of Fanny Craddock or whatever
A	like yeah it's like action cooking
B	mind you
A	with the eyebrows
B	yeah I mean I I think  I think I think  she could take on Schwarzenegger like
A	what was her helper? What was her little called again?
B	I don't know
A	no
B	yeah
A	he was like her sort of obedient husband and she used to like shout at him and stuff
B	that's that's disturbing actually
A	I don't really see it because we haven't got a
B	you don't  you don't  have a like a box set of a
A	no but there's all those food channels like we haven't got them
B	oh yeah well there's that American one isn't there when he he his his purpose is to sort of eat as much as he can before he sort of dies
A	man Versus Food?
B	yeah
A	oh he's a pig him
B	he he sort of he has a show called the America's Greediest Person or something and then yeah
A	man
B	oh right yeah
A	yeah it always looks tasty but like a tiny plate of it not like seven you know cows in a bap or something
B	he's like a Elvis Elvis burger or something
A	it's like super chilly
B	okay
A	but yeah I think
B	do but now so but you actually like watching erm MasterChef don't you?
A	yeah
B	the new one with yeah
A	I like I do like I like sort of erm
B	yeah they it seems extremely hard to to work in that high-pressure environment in in a big you know proper posh restaurant like it seems
A	I think I wouldn't like
B	yeah
A	the foam isn't foamy enough
B	yeah
A	but I think it's why I don't think I'd like to be a chef because like erm I don't think I'd like the hours
B	yeah the oh yeah actually because it is a bit sort of well you've got a lunch one that's alright
A	no but you can't just say I'm going to be like a lunchtime chef
B	you could
A	that's a dinner lady
B	that I considered being like a chef and I think if I had been a chef I would have wanted to work in during brunch and lunch
A	dinner lady then
B	er supposing so
B	er just chef I think er
A	well that seems a bit sexist if the dinner ladies are called the dinner ladies
B	yeah well that's just composition really I mean that's what they are isn't it? They're
A	maybe like with the political correctness maybe they're like dinner persons or something
A	the lunchtime
B	I like operative but the special special operations at lunch or something
A	lunchtime nourishment facilitator or something
B	but other that's that's amazing er but I think if you can't do the lunch shift then you've then got to sort of hang around from lunch till like evening
A	but do they not have to prep loads of stuff
A	I don't think they do
B	not a skinning the carrot or something
A	no but do you know what I mean? They've got to like chop things and like
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	they have to make it in bulk or something so like a bit pot or something
A	do they not like turn their noses up at them kind of things like
B	I well I think they're saying that they might say  they might say  they do but I think they maybe secretly
A	yeah but sometimes like they must have to half cook like
B	erm those are probably microwaved aren't they
A	I know
B	yeah
A	it's a bit disturbing really isn't it really when you think about it
B	what?
A	like radiating your food
B	oh you mean the science behind microwaving
A	do you not think?
B	it's just a bit space-agey
A	yeah
B	erm obviously radio waves go through our heads all the time don't they
A	yeah but I mean to purposely do that to eat your dinner seems a bit weird
B	how they found it out must be quite interesting
A	yeah like accidentally left his sandwich
B	er blasting each blasting themselves and various food items with radiation must have had a cracking cracking afternoon erm
A	I don't even miss one like cos obviously we haven't got enough room but I don't even miss it
B	erm so a microwave yeah it's to do with the er frequency and I think it's to do with the water molecules vibrating or something
A	mm
B	erm and there's some stuff you can't put in isn't there
A	yeah like when you're
B	yeah
A	no
B	no she's she's no
A	but anyway erm
B	and er
A	but we don't have to watch
B	micro chef
A	maybe they could have like a round where they could only use a microwave like there's no ovens
B	yeah but
A	like and they've got like lovely cuts of beef and like shellfish and like lovely hams and that
B	like a dream like a sort of twenty-
A	no but like instead of the fresh ingredients they have to make something out of like some Frazzles a Twix
B	yeah
A	oh yeah like
B	is it just like things that survive? Is this like a sort of wartime thing where you can only use things that that are not perishable so
A	I don't know
B	you erm it's just like wartime cooking
A	nothing wrong with a bit of wartime cooking
B	it's like er corned beef er  things that  things that wash up  on the  on the you'll find on like the beach washed up from like some submarine or something
A	I'm not I'm not have you say anything bad about corned beef I'm afraid
B	er no no I like erm er certain types of that sort of meat
A	yeah
B	but er
A	I do corned beef is really nice
B	is that that's the pancreas is it?
A	it's some sort of horrible disgusting
B	so it's making a comeback is it?
A	is it the pancreas? Sweet bread?
B	yeah
A	horrible piece
B	er
A	brains for meat
B	well I think it's good to use to use it you know like
A	and it's nearly Burns Night
B	erm
A	it's prime offal eating time
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	sawdust yeah
A	well unless you get those really expensive ones
B	yeah well I mean when we think of something as being tasty that
A	yeah
B	we may well think that that some like a pizza would be very tasty but whereas in in fact it's just really a kind of low quality dough and like low quality cheese and low quality tomato sauce and stuff and so it's not very good quality but it's tasty but
A	yeah like that pizza we had at  That was horrible
B	yeah
A	and like I don't think I could eat like you know erm like a fried
B	yeah er definitely I think you have to have a little bit of salt with your egg yeah
A	oh I really fancy a boiled egg
B	erm yeah I
A	I don't think I did it
B	hmm mm
A	I came
B	well you matured it
A	that's that's one theory
B	well at least it's
A	that's one one way of putting it
B	so er what's your favourite thing that you enjoy cooking the most? Like do you enjoy cooking like er bigger dishes? The savoury dishes or like sweet dishes or or like pastry?
A	I don't know
B	right so you sort of prefer  more like  more like sensible food more then
B	you just have that
A	I know it was a majority vote
B	my parents requested a turkey with all the trimmings erm which means stuffing er and those little bacon and sausage things which I think are called pig in blankets or something
A	yeah
B	that's the er but we had a  it was a good  it was a good dinner though
A	ah I don't know though
B	er I think all meat has its own distinct taste
A	no but I mean
B	erm no I don't think
A	mm mm
B	er I like the turkey breast yeah because it's good for you and
A	yeah
B	erm yeah turkey's okay I mean
A	I think it's unnecessary that they cook like the whole turkey
B	but you're supposed to have like a
A	it can be a goose
B	this is the
A	yeah I think they had it in Aldi though
B	erm they actually
A	cut price
B	so you've got like
A	like a
B	erm
A	it was like a four bird erm four bird roast or something
B	so what what did it what what was the?
A	I don't know like a robin inside like a sparrow inside like a crow inside like an owl inside like a chicken or something
B	it could  it could  go on indefinitely couldn't it
A	Don't know may not be true
B	er Poussin or something
A	yeah Poussin
B	is that like is that not a baby or something or?
A	I don't know
B	er wood pigeons are quite small aren't they
A	oh maybe it was pigeon
B	yeah
A	that's nobody needs that many meat
B	it's that's extravagance
A	but you can get that in Aldi like just as if that was like a normal thing
B	well  it's just the  it's just the sheer thought of er luxury of it I suppose
B	literally
A	literally crackers
B	er
A	they
B	erm there's that yeah there's them
A	I like a nice warm mince pie
B	I like er I like all of it
A	some mulled wine
B	er which you pour brandy over and set fire to
A	oh I don't like Christmas
B	and er then er you could put some kind of sauce like a rum sauce or like a brandy sauce over it and then that's good
A	I know
B	er well the it Christmas pudding yeah it would have that cos it's sort of suet isn't it
A	what do you mean?
B	the you know the sauces
A	the custard
B	then that would take away the sort of stodginess of it and replace it with a more
A	what what if you're eating it with brandy butter you mean? Like that's not going to take away
B	well not necessarily brandy but you could have like rum sauce or custard or ice cream or
A	uh-huh
B	some some kind of cream vanilla cream or something but er erm
A	yeah actually I saw
B	if you mix it it is really nice
A	yeah
B	that's what did it used to be with like Anne and? No
A	er Anne Diamond
B	no no Anne and Nick
A	no that was
B	well did they used to do it or?
A	oh yeah maybe
B	is that a? Phillip and Holly Willoughby
A	holly Willoughby yeah
B	er yeah
A	erm
B	well I've never seen that with him and her
A	no well I watched it
B	yeah I mean well we've being going down a sort of like elderly sort of theme I think
A	food
B	oh yeah
A	or was it mince pie ice cream? Either way
B	yeah erm that's that's probably quite quite possibly true yeah
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	mm
B	you've got to sort of erm yeah you can't you don't want to
A	yeah
B	oh yeah just
A	I could happily pass on the mash though
B	oh erm
A	did you do this?
B	no er that sounds like the sort of thing that they do it in
A	did you have packed? Prison?
B	oh maybe prison
A	I don't know
B	there was time time on a school trip when I went to boarding school and for a week and I think the the serving was different erm but
A	mm
B	oh right I just
B	oh yeah yeah oh yeah we used to have them sort of ones like the that's old fashioned sort of British erm mashed potatoes
A	it was like mashed
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and then so they'd be like oh do you want potato? And you'd be like yeah
B	yeah you've got  a bit of a  a bit of a disliking to them haven't you so er er
A	I think that's it I think I'm traumatised by the chatty splats
B	that is chatty splat
A	potato
B	oh right I didn't know that
A	I don't  I've never heard it  I've never heard it since
B	chatty
A	I wouldn't be like oh can I have some chatty
B	that's er it's probably a north eastern words is it?
A	I don't know I think it was just a stupid primary school thing like
B	er school dinners are definitely like er I mean  the further back  the further back I try to remember the worse the more disturbing it gets like
A	and did you have lemon love pie?
B	well in my infant school I think I could remember having
A	lemon love pie
B	it would sort of smell of beetroot and mushy peas
A	what the lemon love pie?
B	no I don't know what that is but I'm saying that the dinning hall you went in I remember the smell it was like mushy peas and beetroot and mashed potato and beef burgers and that
A	oh
B	they'd give you a beef burger but it like didn't have any bread on it
A	oh yeah I remember
B	yeah and they had like bits in them and you thought you know
A	yeah like sawdust and that like I said
B	oh er and and then we later found out er that obviously during the eighties there was quite a lot of erm that disease going around
A	when I was at senior school
B	yeah yeah I know
A	so you never know
B	well erm
A	do you want to make another cup of tea?
B	yeah
A	hmm mm
