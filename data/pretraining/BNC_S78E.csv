A	so the last time you came to the steam fair how long did it take to get in?
B	I can't remember
A	mm
B	I know we
C	quite a while
B	I know we did queue for quite a while
A	yeah I mean if the queue went further back there you must've done right?
B	ugh it's probably back there now
A	yeah just catching the tail end
B	yeah I know that's what's there
A	yeah did they have the smaller houses or?
B	might be like erm elderly
A	oh yeah that's one way the council could put housing out here isn't it? isn't it? can do the council do that? make elderly housing?
C	well they did do it
A	they did
B	well at the end of erm church green there was that little
A	are they for the elderly?
B	yeah
A	at the end of church green?
B	yeah I don't think
A	right near opposite the bell almost?
B	yeah a little
A	oh yeah there was wasn't there?
B	yeah
A	don't think I ever went up there
B	the people that were in our house in
A	oh really?
B	to one of them yeah
A	oh the people before you?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	mm
A	so have you eh
B	yeah well
A	no no I mean if you asked to be put in something smaller
A	ah they
B	yeah because they obviously they can't do stairs can they? as they get old
A	ah I didn't realise
B	and then
A	yeah
B	I mean it's right near where they were before anyway but oh you know old people they get so stubborn when they've lived somewhere all their lives
A	yeah they don't want to move
B	no
A	yeah I know both of them did is that what her parents are called?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	aw that's classic
A	mm
B	they haven't got a lot of money they get all the help
A	yeah I bet they do
B	care managers and tenants allowance
C	yeah
A	you are better off in
B	not having any money when you're older?
A	sometimes aren't you? I mean it depends there's a fine line
B	there is a fine line
A	which is with everything in our society really isn't it? and there's that fine line between what is
A	erm what's what gets you quite a lot of help from the government and then gets you none at all
C	same
A	yeah it's the same brick again on that house
B	mm
A	which makes me wonder ah maybe it is council unless it's some more just private housing development
B	yeah I mean I don't because they don't actually there's not a lot of council properties now they're all housing association
C	yeah
A	oh right is that different then?
B	yeah
A	but the housing association provides government housing doesn't it?
B	yeah cheap housing
A	cheap housing yeah because it was on the news this morning wasn't it about
B	yeah yeah
A	and something called a half studio so not even a full studio flat but it's a studio it's they eh showed a picture it's a one room with your kitchen in there really small room and your shower is next to your kitchen and it's really tiny and it was in
A	and they were just saying that that now you they need to something needs to happen where they start regulating prices for landlords because it's just becoming ridiculous
B	mm
A	and people want you know there are some people slightly willing to pay but and apparently the argument is
B	disabled use gate four
A	problem is that
C	oy
A	you need a massive deposit to have a mortgage up front don't you?
B	of course you do don't you?
A	so you need savings which people don't have
B	yeah
A	so it's just become they're saying that the housing association and what not need to step up and provide more cheap rented accommodation
B	accommodation yeah
A	it doesn't have to be council or government just cheap affordable rentable accommodation because at the moment the landlords are running the lot
B	but
A	to even qualify anymore yeah because it's so in demand
B	yeah
A	so yeah it just needs to be more yeah
B	or single parents
A	yeah
B	they get it
A	it's just another problem altogether isn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah there needs to be a separate bracket that's just affordable
B	I mean because you know
A	yeah
B	but they can't afford to rent on privately
A	no it's a shame isn't it?
B	they can't
B	oh didn't you?
A	it's
B	mm
A	but because they're in private that means they're not entitled to the same things are they when they get older?
B	yeah
A	because they're not in council
B	no
A	but yeah
B	yeah
A	seems such a shame though to spend your entire life renting a property
B	mm
A	it just seems like such a waste of money
B	mm well it is isn't it?
A	well I I feel like the eh at the end of so many years the landlord should be like oh okay then you've you've you've paid my mortgage now so you can have the property
B	aw
A	never will will they?
B	no course they won't
A	i'm not
B	oh yeah they probably could because they they they it's not just they don't just have that one house then his landlord
A	no exactly
B	they've got more than one house
A	yeah
B	that they rent out
A	most landlords do now don't they
B	yeah
A	or a lot of them do make a business from it and even though a lot of them are bought up you know it's that when you and dad bought your houses when people started really buying their own property didn't they?
B	mm
A	which helped the boom you could get houses much much cheaper then
A	they already finished do you reckon?
C	well some come a couple of days before stay and then they go home and you'll see the mud look
A	yeah that's true some could've come stayed last night couldn't they?
C	had enough of it because of the wet weather and look it's going to go right up
A	god
C	told you it's three or four mile didn't I?
B	you did dear
A	mm think you were right there dad
B	he was right
C	coming the other road would've cut a lot of this out but
C	yeah
A	disabled parking that's good isn't it? coaches
C	yep
B	yeah
A	so hopefully that's a bit closer eh?
B	yeah okay
C	well we might be one two three four further
A	oh yeah might be further to drive
B	mm
A	closer to the camp or whatever
C	ah oh yeah oh it's going to be a bit better isn't it?
A	oh it's
C	I bet I bet there's fucking loads of disabled vehicles in there now
A	yeah I'm sure there are
C	mm
B	oh there's a country smell out there
C	as long as there's somebody checking the badges because I don't want nobody going in if it's not legal I'm not like that
A	no you wouldn't flash someone else's badge would you?
B	because you are so disabled aren't you?
C	yes
B	oh yeah I know you do
A	I do he he's hard to keep up with going round a bloody boot fair soon springs into life then
A	gate four it said did it?
B	yeah
A	I think it's kind of closer actually
C	I don't know
A	oh no that's not even a road is it going to be to our left do you think?
C	no no it might be
A	it's to our right is it?
C	might be
B	I can't remember I think it I can't remember
A	because the gates are going up as though it'll be coming up on our left
C	we'll have the overhead sign
A	oh unless we're coming up this way in which case it's on our right
C	yeah
A	oh it might be on our right in which case it is further
C	don't matter
C	no
A	no yeah it brings you it'll take you more straight into the centre of everything
C	hopefully not anyway
A	which will actually bring you out right next to the trade section dad
C	will it?
A	yeah
A	if we just go in a straight line
C	get in there and have one of these big hot dogs
A	passed the VIP's tent and then past the fair ground and you're at the

C	sad people
A	they're not sad why are they sad?
C	why are they walking they got about it's about four mile up here
A	some people don't consider that far to walk
B	some people would rather be walking than be stuck in a
A	stuck in traffic
B	exactly
C	oh so would I I'd sooner be walking to be honest
