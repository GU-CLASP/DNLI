B	you'd have been like holy crap
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	Cos I did it on purpose to see if it would evoke him
A	mm
B	like to to do something
A	mm
B	I wouldn't have questioned it
A	yeah
unknown_female	yo

A	mm
unknown_female	right

A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's just he's just not  on you at all
B	yeah
unknown_female	woo woo
B	if you're not if I'm not gonna hit any type of priority when I could've been killed
A	mm
B	then really that just shows you
A	fuck
B	I said to
A	mm
B	I said it it's just a stark example of the person that he's turned into
A	mm
B	Cos the
A	yeah
B	the fact that that he's getting information like that and doesn't see it as being important
A	Cos er that's er
B	it's just
A	it's it's anybody
B	yeah
A	know
B	yeah
A	you'd be holy shit
B	you know
A	yeah
B	that's exactly what he's thought
A	well I can't come and see you because obviously for the next forty-eight hours I can't leave her side
A	mm
unknown_female	are you alright for juice
B	if I'd have heard that I would've
A	mm
B	said to him
unknown_female	that's fine
B	look I'm gonna have to do this
unknown_female	oh you've got them?
A	mm
B	do you wanna?
A	oh er clearly
B	do you wanna put a film on or something? I'll be back in an hour and a half
A	yeah
unknown_female	uh
A	yeah
B	or do you mind if I just make a phone call? Like even if it was just a phone call
A	mm
B	to call me
A	mm
B	are you sure you're okay? Not even a phone call
A	nothing
B	no
A	weird
B	yeah
A	it's very strange
unknown_female	oh really?
unknown_female	yeah
B	and mental as that may be for someone that you don't really know
A	no
B	very much
B	she says if I were you I'd just write him out write him off
A	this is what I keep saying
B	mm
A	I just think
unknown_female	you're playing it cool but playing it
A	every every time
A	everyday he just
unknown_female	nah
A	makes the situation worse
B	yeah
A	that he lets you down
unknown_female	yeah true
A	it's a blow
unknown_female	and she says this
B	yeah
unknown_female	she says it's not
A	and there's only so much that you can cope with
unknown_female	mm
A	like you're already like if you feel shit like this weekend you feel shit you don't wanna be reminded
A	that he's acting like a tool at the same time
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	but it's easier it's I do appreciate it's easier said than done
unknown_female	yeah
A	but
unknown_female	no?
unknown_female	no
B	I said to
B	hurt since I've been apart from him
unknown_female	yeah
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	like and seriously
A	mm
B	and that he wasn't there to look after me
B	or run a bath or
A	mm
B	just tell me it's gonna be alright
A	well it's not until like something like that happens that you realize how like
A	how different he is now with you
B	yeah
B	want to be around him
A	well no
B	yeah
A	isn't he
B	really selfish
A	mm
unknown_female	I suppose
B	I mean I always knew he was selfish
B	and I used to tell his mum he was selfish
A	mm
B	I never thought he would
A	I mean you were saying that you know with his other friends he's been cutting them out
A	check that they're okay
B	no
A	really?
B	that's it
unknown_female	yeah
B	he was trying to say to me when we were in
unknown_female	almost
B	because of how crap he is at life and he cuts them out and doesn't really talk to them
A	they don't even bother to
unknown_female	well no it is
B	yeah
A	you'd be gutted
A	like if you like with
B	mm
A	she doesn't talk about her problem
A	because she thinks it's really boring
unknown_female	I can't remember
A	I didn't even realize that she'd
A	she didn't call me
unknown_female	not
A	because you think
B	yeah
A	oh my God you feel like you can't come and talk to me
A	and it's it's not alright it's because she can't she doesn't want to burden people with her problems
unknown_female	oh
A	even someone like me and we're really close
C	mm?
B	can you close the door to please? Thanks dear
B	it's making me feel a bit sick
A	yeah
unknown_female	no that bit's great
A	it's hard
B	yeah
A	you know if he's got if you feel like you're a bad friend do something about it
B	that's he was saying when we were in London
A	er
B	actual by actual fact he shouldn't have bothered saying that cos he didn't want to do anything about it
A	yes
B	care for sure
A	like it's not he's just it's almost sort of like he's pointing out that that's the problem but he's there's no culpability there
B	yeah
A	accepting that it's his
B	yeah
A	er or plan to do anything about it
B	I think yeah I mean I just realized it's he realizes it's his fault
A	mm
B	I mean er to be honest I don't really want him to come round
A	mm
B	Cos I know what's gonna happen
A	I don't think seeing him is a good idea
B	yeah
A	and the last time before that you saw him face to face when was that? Um my point is did you are you arguing every time you're seeing each other? I think
B	no
A	no? Are you sure?
B	no
A	Cos seems like every time you see him there's some sort of he lets you down or there's a problem or you know
B	yeah
A	Cos there was The Comedy Club
B	oh yeah
A	and that was a bit of a problem
B	yeah it was
B	no thank you
A	tea? No?
B	just a guilty pleasure ain't it
A	yeah
B	but I know I don't actually want to see him
A	oh well no
B	yeah
A	but you've gotta think of it as self-preservation
B	I'm gonna text him and say do you know what don't bother  don't bother  coming round tomorrow
A	mm
B	not Monday four days later
A	mm
A	yeah
C	mm?
A	because it doesn't
B	no
A	you know
A	I had this with a friend of mine at uni
B	no
A	and I'm like that's the most retarded thing I've
B	yeah
A	ever heard in my life
C	yeah
A	I don't think that's true at all
B	no
A	it takes constant all relationships take work and effort on
B	yeah
A	both parts
B	well it's a friendship
A	yeah
A	exactly
A	exactly
B	course it does
A	yeah
B	that's what happens
A	absolutely
A	speaking of I'm starting to feel quite guilty for not going out last night with for
B	oh yeah
A	she didn't replied
A	oh you could've let me know sooner
B	mm
A	I think well
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	seriously
A	I mean I had to chase her for the plans
A	and I think
unknown_female	yeah
A	if there'd been a well this is what we're doing not like military precision but you know
B	no
A	this is what I want to do
A	it would've been different
B	yeah
A	but I still do feel a bit guilty
B	I'd be sitting on selfish street for this one
A	yeah
A	I mean no one wants to think of themselves as a bad friend but it doesn't seem to bother
B	no
B	it really doesn't
C	one two three
B	the more I think about it
B	you're right
A	well the thing is er if you woke up tomorrow morning and think oh do you know what? I probably do wanna see him
B	like just seeing his face is gonna anger me
A	yep
B	he's gonna make my blood boil
A	it's gonna end in a  in a  argument
B	yeah
A	at this point
unknown_female	I think it was
A	how much more can your heart take? Er cos the constant blow every time it lets you down
B	yeah
A	well doesn't seem like it
B	no
A	so no I would say he's not gonna be one
B	huh
A	at least er but the more that you recognize it the more that you see it
B	yeah
A	it's gonna get easier
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't need you four days later
A	well
C	I think
B	which is true
unknown_female	oh
A	I mean it's totally up to you
C	it's one of the same
A	I mean you can either you know say that as a way of making a point
C	yeah
A	or just say look
A	just don't come round I've you know
B	mm
A	Cos obviously if you start down that road he's gonna come back with something
A	and that's gonna open communication channels
unknown_female	yeah sort of
A	so it's whether you wanna sort of engage in that
C	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	I think if he replied after that I just wouldn't reply
unknown_female	right
B	I know what's gonna happen
B	either he comes here and I'm gonna lay into him
C	it's so much easier to use than my text messaging
unknown_female	yeah
B	I'm gonna
A	yeah
B	he's not yeah he's just he's he's not taking it on board
A	mm
B	come to that conclusion himself
A	yeah
unknown_female	did I tell you
B	and really I think we both know it's not gonna make any difference whether he receives that message or not
B	to him
A	yeah
B	but it'll make me feel a bit better that I've had a little dig
A	yeah
unknown_female	if I had
A	well then
unknown_female	I would spend sixty-five
A	there you go
C	really?
A	sounds like a good idea
A	Cos it's it's so hard when you rely on a person like that and they let you down every time
C	well
unknown_female	if it was free delivery I would've donated a lot higher
C	yeah
C	well most of that
A	huh
unknown_female	goes to the
unknown_female	charity anyway
A	my tummy hurts man
B	urgh
A	how are you feeling?
B	just shakey
A	shakey?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I just feel a bit hollow
A	oh huh
B	I took a photograph of my injuries again
A	oh huh
B	yeah
B	go go go
A	I've gotta find that charger
B	I've had one every day now
A	A photo?
B	done a photo every day for that yep
A	I think we'll have to put the photos on my laptop with me
B	yes
A	London photos
B	aw
A	it'd be the end of
B	huh I'm gonna be needing a laptop bad
C	she got a little bit
A	are you?
C	upset
B	yeah
C	you know when you were cutting your
B	oh no
C	she was cutting your hair?
unknown_female	yeah
B	I only managed two
C	and you kept looking at me when she was talking about
A	that's weird isn't it
C	well she was throwing hints in about babies
A	Cos of course
unknown_female	mm
A	you had the cheeseburger
A	and then you had a lie down
C	yeah you were
A	maybe you need to sleep every time you eat
C	Cos I know you know but I told you not to sort of say anything
B	maybe I need to sleep it off
unknown_female	yeah
A	or or at least yeah
C	oh yeah
A	whether it's um sitting up or
B	maybe I need to put a film on
C	I told her that you knew
A	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
C	something
B	maybe I need to put a Spanish film on
unknown_female	but not all of it
B	yeah
unknown_female	I said there's a possibility
A	they are a bit weird
unknown_female	that we could be pregnant
B	with the
A	yeah
A	unless I've remembered it wrong
C	I said don't worry I won't say anything else
A	I think it is that one
C	until we know for sure
A	yeah it might be nice to veg out
C	and come the weekend hopefully we'll know and we'll start spreading the word
B	just gonna ask
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
C	get everyone excited and then something bad goes wrong
B	ooh
C	you know
B	I'm going back to bed now
C	huh
unknown_female	huh

C	oh right
B	if my patio doors are closed will you close it for me? Cos I tried to close it and usually I'm quite good at

C	just want me to push it shut yeah?
B	cheers
C	Will do
B	yep

unknown_female	yeah
C	if you went to the
unknown_female	and just drive it off out of there
