A	right
B	right
A	and erm would you like to tell me how long you've lived in in
B	er forty-eight years erm
A	forty-eight years?
A	gosh
B	yeah
A	so where were you born?
A	right
B	yeah born and bred
A	right erm so then you've probably got more of a local accent than anybody
B	I would so say so yeah I mean
A	yeah
B	some people say I've got a real
A	and I I know you've been in a family business for years
B	yeah
A	haven't you?
B	yeah
A	erm and you're erm er a carpenter by trade?
B	yeah that's it
A	yeah?
B	carpenter yeah
A	and erm what sort of work do you do?
B	well carpentry joinery buildings extensions conversions anything really in the
A	what do you favour yourself mostly?
B	erm the joinery side of things making windows doors staircases and maybe putting kitchens in and
A	right
B	er things like that yeah
A	right and so where did you learn your trade?
B	er I learnt my trade with my father I was er he sort of er said why don't you come on and work for me? so I said alright and I'll give it a go sort of thing cos er I I I'd left school about four years and hadn't really sort of thought about doing that and erm then started and never looked back
A	right I see and er but you didn't actually go formally to college? you were an apprenticeship?
B	oh yeah yeah I done a full apprenticeship four
A	did you?
B	four year apprenticeship
A	right
B	going through erm the basic three years carpentry and joinery and then the one years of arts craft
A	right and what?
B	yeah
B	well I had to go travel for that I had for the first three years I had to go to
A	right
B	of er further education
A	yeah
B	erm because they didn't run the course in
A	right right things were very different in those days weren't they? because erm
B	well it it did yes
A	trades
B	oh for trades yeah
A	yeah
B	you can't learn anything these
B	very much these days
B	in there
A	no
B	and it's it's changed the way they run the apprenticeships are
A	absolutely
B	not not good for the the construction industry
A	no I'm sure they're not erm
B	yeah
A	the erm I I mean I did an art degree erm five years ago erm at
B	right
A	erm and it was very different and er the principal has got rid of all the erm art erm
B	oh right
A	yeah at that level there aren't any degree courses for fine art now I think I was the
B	oh
A	penultimate well there was one other after my course erm but anyway
B	oh
A	the according to the tutors who all got made redundant they were quite you know cross about that anyway back to you which is far more important so you're a model engineer today and you're
B	yes
A	and you're here to do the working party yeah?
B	well I've I've stopped in just to drop some materials off really
A	oh have you? oh
B	for for for all the rest of them to do something
A	oh
A	oh
B	yeah this is it
A	and get them get them working
B	yeah give them something to work with
B	erm oh on and off for oh
A	right
B	but er I dropped away for a for quite a while it was probably ten or fifteen years erm really not having so much to do with it cos it was more my father's hobby
A	yeah
B	erm unfortunately when he passed away I decided that you know I'd come and sort of help them do a few bits and pieces and then er I've got back into it a bit more since then but er yeah it's it's really er I'm but I've been involved in some
A	what are you working on at the moment?
B	er well I've erm
A	oh right
B	bases in there which I'll make all the woodwork tops for
A	oh right yes
B	sort of thing so
A	oh right
B	erm cos they're hoping to have a an open day next year
A	right
B	erm and they want some extra carriages
A	oh right yes I've heard about the open day that that should be interesting
A	I think there are several schools of thought on that aren't there?
B	yes there's a yes there's erm
B	it's er should be interesting anyway but er yeah so we can get the carriages made and I'm also making a couple of my own so
A	right
B	I'll get those as well and then they'll have plenty of er carriages to run on their railway here
A	jolly good jolly good that's great erm because erm this model engineers is in a park here isn't it? can you tell can you describe the park to me this morning?
B	er yes the park's erm probably about er five hundred yards across and five hundred
A	right yeah and erm it it's a
B	it is
A	yeah and the we're we're very near the motorway in the background you can hear the motorway erm and that's that's not a problem erm I used to live in
B	no to be honest you don't I mean
A	no
B	we we work next to a railway line in our workshop and people have come in to us before and said christ bet you enjoy this cos the trains aren't running today and you go what trains? cos you really don't take any notice of the
A	exactly
B	you know
A	well I mean also I expect you've got a lot of equipment on the go haven't you? noisy equipment
B	yeah there's a lot of times yeah
A	and you've got ear defenders on I expect and all that sort of thing
B	most of the time yeah yeah
B	er
A	which you know
B	that's it yeah was erm the the carriage was the carriage shed er there was named in his honour after unfortunately after he passed away
A	oh
B	and they named it in his honour and cos because he was sort of like the driving force behind it if you like
A	right
B	erm in getting it built and that well and for the model engineers for a quite a
A	yeah yeah
B	he was er very much involved from about nineteen eighty I think when
A	yes
B	originally started up
A	yes
B	erm so yeah it's er it's nice to sort of like er have the knowledge that there's something's named in his er honour out here really you know
A	wonderful
B	it's quite a privilege really yeah
A	wonderful given the local politics you know that ebb and flow around the place erm it's great that
B	yeah yeah
A	isn't it?
B	this is it yeah this is it
A	bit of an achievement
B	er yeah it is really considering er you know
A	yeah
B	as they were building it
A	yeah
B	whenever night time when all people went home somebody
A	really?
B	at night time yeah
A	really? yeah
B	yeah sort of thing just sort of and they did find out it was one particular person er I don't know who it was now but lived in a bungalow down across the way and he could see it being put up during the day and obviously didn't like the idea of somebody building up here and come up in the night time and pushed the walls over
A	I didn't hear that story
B	oh right
A	I hadn't heard the story
B	yeah
A	I did hear cos the twenty years ago when I met
B	oh right
A	and I had a house in fact they're building in you know at the back of it now and I'm
B	right
A	and it how it bulldozed the pavilion down?
B	yeah yeah
A	and I remember that and when later they said oh they're going out to
A	it's a terrible place
B	a terrible place
A	yeah
B	yeah this is it yeah as we've built it up they they'd come up the next day or the next week
A	yeah
B	and find all the walls were pushed over sort of thing and had to rebuild them
A	oh how do you feel about that?
B	well it's I just think this is just there's er
A	yeah
B	they'd rather vandalise something than actually construct something
A	yes
B	you know and er they you know instead of just coming along and saying well you know why are you here? and why do you wanna be here? and understand the reasons for it
A	yeah
B	they'd rather just come up on their own and erm
A	yeah
B	destroy other people's hard work
A	yes I mean even if you ask them to to join and come they probably wouldn't come
B	no no but they'd rather you know they'd rather spoil everybody else's thing and
A	spoil everybody's work yeah
B	they cost people money at the end of the day you know and
A	oh definitely
B	and I think at the end of the day it was criminal damage as well you know
A	yeah
B	er
A	erm
B	well I mean I wasn't that involved at that point
A	no
B	erm I mean it was because it was more my father's hobby
A	yeah
B	I thought no you know he's happy doing that and it's his hobby er and it wasn't until after he went we sort of we said well you know we just will go out there and help er do finish off something he started cos
A	yeah
B	it was very unusual because usually he was helping finish something we started
A	right right
B	erm so we thought we'd go out and sort of help finish it and we were out here sort of thing erm and the clubhouse had been finished by that point
A	right
B	erm but I mean I know when he used to come back and he used to say you know sort of thing people had been up here and vandalised it they you know
A	yeah
B	they spent a day building walls and had to then
A	yeah
B	rebuild them
A	yes
B	sort of thing which is really
A	exactly
B	rather disheartening for people
A	oh definitely
B	yeah
A	definitely erm one of the things that really I really admire about the model engineers above any other society is that they're all well you all are craftsmen and you're all engineers
B	of some description yeah
A	of some description
B	yeah yeah
A	and that you all make things and sometimes from scratch erm mostly from scratch erm er
B	yeah yeah
A	and if he can't go in he gets grumpy
A	er er does that apply to you? if you can't make something?
B	er well I no I well I I enjoy getting away
B	from the work I have to admit
B	yeah yeah I do enjoy getting away from the work
A	yeah right
B	erm but I mean I also I've got a boat as well you see
A	oh have you?
B	so er I enjoy sort of
A	right
B	like er using that which is er something so that's my escape from work and that's
A	right
B	that's on a marina down in
A	ah
B	somebody can't get hold of me easily to say come and do this and come and do that
A	yeah
B	because the phone is always on twenty-four seven but erm
A	mm
B	I mean it's nice to be away and then you can say well I'm too far away to
A	yes exactly and you don't take a mobile with you obviously
B	I I do but that's only for emergencies really
A	yes yes
B	yeah yeah
A	so erm well well tell me about your boat that's wonderful erm how many foot long is
B	erm it was twenty twenty-four feet feet long
A	oh right yes
B	erm it's a it's a fishing a type of fishing boat
A	yeah
B	er it was originally they made them as fishing boats but they
A	right
B	they've they call still call them a fishing boat but it's more of a pleasure boat now
A	right
B	rather than a fishing boat erm the they gradually evolved from giving less deck space at the back and giving more cabin space
A	right
B	erm which is quite nice and it sleeps about four people
A	oh I see
B	and er
A	yeah
B	you know you've got a little cooker and fridge and
A	yeah
B	just just just er pleasurable to get out and get out on the sea really
A	so erm are you you're not nervous obviously about taking it out?
B	oh not at all
A	erm what what sort of weather would put you off?
B	erm to be honest as long as long as we're under sort of twenty-two miles an hour
A	yeah
B	we're we're alright and then it depends on the direction of the wind er down in er where I'm
A	yeah
B	er they're particularly bad they have a tendency
A	right
B	to really chop the sea up
A	right
B	erm but if it's southerly winds and it's offshore
A	right
B	you're not too bad
A	right
B	usually the sea stays fairly flat
A	good
B	yeah
A	right so so whereabouts is it berthed? did
B	er
A	oh
B	yeah
B	yeah it is beautiful
A	but do you find difficulty getting down there in the summer when there are so many
B	it it can be yeah
A	mm
B	you can long as you go down early in the morning no I mean it's averages about an hour and ten hour and twenty minutes?
A	oh that's not too
B	so it's not too bad
A	no
B	and of a night time when I come home and it's late
A	yeah
B	er I can usually do it in about an hour and five
A	right
B	or an hour and ten minutes
A	right
B	easily erm and they also are building a new the bypass through
A	oh are they?
B	now
A	right
B	which takes you straight from
A	good yeah
B	er so it saves a lot that's gonna save a lot of time
A	yes
B	hopefully
A	good good so you're planning a lot more I bet you're waiting for next summer or do you
B	yeah this is it
A	do you go down all the year round?
B	I do yes
A	do you?
B	yes I'm
A	yeah
B	going down next Friday
A	are you?
B	to take it for a service
A	oh right
B	or we've got a day off next Friday
A	oh wonderful
B	to take it to
A	and and what's is it a she? what's she called?
B	er
B	so yeah
A	right okay
B	sort of thing er it was named by the previous owner
A	right
B	I don't know why
A	no
B	it was named
A	it is
B	when you're on a radio
A	yes
B	if you're radioing in
A	yes
B	to somebody it's easier
A	yeah
B	to say
A	a great big
B	drawn out name
A	yeah
B	sort of thing
B	yeah this is the thing
B	yeah which is
B	and if you've got to spell out in
A	yeah exactly
A	yeah you're done
A	yeah well that's a very good name I mean
B	yeah
A	I can see the value in that erm I I was lucky myself once to have erm a job for the summer erm to crew on a on a twenty-four foot
B	oh lovely
A	I can't remember what it was called erm it was erm it was a friend of my sister's and my sister didn't want to go with him so I went and erm I had to cook and clean and just like you know help
B	yeah
A	cast off and you know do all the things
B	yeah
A	and I did it and we went all around the Isle of Wight over to the Isle of Wight all you know it was it was it was great because er we had an Indian summer and the weather was very good we've got another two minutes?
B	yeah that's alright
A	to do? so erm er do you go away on holiday as well?
B	er well
A	right
B	er before that I had an open boat which you couldn't sort of sleep on
A	right
B	erm but I had that for a year just to see if I would use it
A	yeah
B	and then I thought right I'll change up to something with a cabin and
A	yeah
B	so a bit more
A	yeah
B	luxurious
A	yes
B	if you like erm but I mean I would like a sailing boat but I can't afford a sailing boat so
A	no
B	I've gotta have a motorboat
A	no oh it's a
B	er
A	a
B	yeah it's a motorboat
A	ours was a sailing boat as well we had
B	yeah
A	we had power
B	I've done a
A	but we had sail as well
B	that's it
A	yeah
B	I've done a lot of sailing in the past cos I used to have very good friends down in
A	yeah
B	had erm sailing boats and that but unfortunately erm they're getting older well one unfortunately passed away one's
A	yeah
B	getting very much older which he doesn't do very much
A	yes
B	but I do prefer sailing I have to admit
A	yeah
B	it's lovely to be out sailing
A	yes
B	but erm unfortunately it's the length it's the upkeep
A	yes exactly
B	erm cos
A	yeah
B	it's every time you go up er three feet of stuff you you're paying more on your moorings for
A	absolutely absolutely
B	yeah
A	so erm yeah I can imagine that the erm yeah so erm now what have we got to do next? oh yeah erm so erm do you take people with you?
B	I do yeah I take my partner down and my
A	yeah
B	stepdaughter
A	oh
B	erm there's also quite a few people I know friends of mine
A	yeah
A	yes
B	sort of thing and I've got quite a few people erm er I've taken the erm er
A	yes
B	and the two children out on it
A	yes
B	I've taken a friend of mine and her two children only youngsters about five and six years old sort of thing
A	yeah
B	they've come out erm and providing they're well behaved it's fine you know
A	it's fine
B	sort of thing
A	yeah
B	cos you've gotta be obviously sensible
A	oh yeah
B	for for safety really
A	oh yes
B	but I mean we
A	yeah
B	er so that's the main thing cos you've got
A	do do you swim from the boat?
B	er I haven't er no
A	no
B	but I mean it's
A	yeah it is
B	sort of thing cos the
A	yeah
B	water temperature does get quite good down there
A	yeah I'm sure
B	in in the summer
A	yes
B	er especially if you get into the bay sort of thing
A	yeah
B	the water temperature can come up quite considerably
A	yeah I was taken out by some people in
B	yeah yeah
A	I never thought er I would being absolutely terrified because I'm not really a very good swimmer but the thing is if you just go round the boat and
B	yeah that's it and stay close
A	there's someone who does sing er swim well
B	yeah
A	you know
B	and being in salt water you always seem a bit more buoyant in salt water as well
A	oh exactly exactly
B	rather than
A	and so can you swim well?
B	I can swim enough if I if my life depended on it
B	I could swim well enough
B	but if I'm just pleasure swimming I do get tired quickly mm
A	yeah well exactly
B	but er if er if my life depended on it I expect I could
A	yeah
B	keep going
A	well that chap Walliams isn't it? Walliams he
B	yeah
A	erm and erm I I mean I don't know how he did that but they managed to do it somehow so erm look we're at sixteen minutes so we're alright there erm
B	very good
A	so I can
