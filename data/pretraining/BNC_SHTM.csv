A	with those tower blocks and stuff the flats
B	yeah
A	quite unusual so this area is
B	but they're building it up are they?
A	yeah well they're trying to put money into it but without changing really like the style of the houses or the they don't want to change they got
B	oh yeah well that's good I like it when they do that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it's like it's the the area speaks the local language instead of Spanish they speak Catalan
B	oh
A	so they're trying to like keep those traditions as well and keep the fishing history
B	yeah
A	but also put money into it because
B	can they talk to each other in the different languages?
A	yeah if you were Spanish fluent native Spanish
B	you could you could go yeah
A	you could understand it and I could we could read it and go more or less
B	yeah
C	I can't understand it when they're speaking it very well but if I read it I roughly know
A	it's basically like
B	ah yeah
C	it has a very
A	like time is like
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	so or or strength is
D	yeah
A	where in Spanish it would be
C	hasn't it got it's got weirdly a few Welsh similarities?
A	yeah so bridge well it's like French as well bridge is
B	pont yeah
A	and in Welsh it's
B	yeah it's strange that yeah
A	erm
C	isn't a
A	no blue is
C	yeah there's a few odd little ones
A	anyway you can see all the houses quite run down
B	ah
A	but the
B	yeah but the gilding is nice
A	and in the day yeah in the day they would have been really beautiful and that's all about a hundred years old the houses
E	would you like a ginger tea
A	you see lots of different types quite a religious area as well
B	ah yeah
F	is there is there tea in the tea pot?
A	old-fashioned doors
B	I I like is that tiles?
A	yes so that's
B	it's not stone?
A	no no so that's like a mosaic style
B	yeah that's what I like yeah
A	comes from North Africa and when Spain used to be Arabic the furthest north they got was Valencia so you get all like the blue like that blue and white is an Arabic colour isn't it? so then that area got famous for erm but you'll see this see this sign here this is saying don't destroy the area cos the government wanted to put like a motorway through the area so all the neighbours got together and kind of protested
B	oh you get yeah yeah oh yeah same as this country isn't it? now with people are trying to stop the wrought iron work is nice
A	yeah the developments yeah so see those doors
B	yeah
A	they're quite really tall oak doors they're built by the shipbuilders cos it's on the beach they used up build their boats but they also used to build the
B	oh they're beautiful oh look at that
A	they're lovely aren't they?
B	oh yeah
A	quite intricate
B	that's modern
A	yeah well the windows it's not a very safe neighbourhood so they've all got like bars in front of the windows and aluminium
B	oh
A	so that's because yeah
D	so it's a high crime area is it?
C	not
A	there's a big gypsy area
C	big big gypsy community
B	do they keep clean or do they discolour?
A	erm I don't know if they discolour but they you'll see them scrubbing it
C	yeah
B	cos I should imagine they're glazed so they won't absorb
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	everything yeah
A	they er they use bicarbonate of soda I think don't they?
C	I don't know
A	you see you see like the old grandmothers it's a real
C	retired yeah
A	grandparents
D	yeah
A	so it's a bit of a mix and you'll usually see em like scrubbing the street
B	ah there won't be too much traffic then
A	no very quiet no but now is a firework festival so all the dust of the fireworks will be on the windows
B	yeah ah cos
A	erm
A	well our our place is in it so see er this mosaic here
B	yeah
A	that's because all the streets used to be rivers not rivers what do you call them? erm inlet's what do you call them
B	streams you mean?
C	lots of people as well sit cos they're they're almost like terraced houses so you don't have a front garden and nobody has a back garden so lots of people sit in front of the house on a deck chair
D	oh yes
C	so you'll walk down the street and they'll just be
D	yeah
C	and they're just sitting there watching the world go by and people will go for a walk and stop and talk to each person in there on their deck chairs so
A	yeah well something that feeds into a river anyway yeah stream I suppose
B	oh yeah so that's
A	they used to go from the city centre they flooded the streets
B	ah
A	between and then you could the bulls would drag the catch of the day all the lobster crates
B	oh yeah
A	up the stream to the market in the city centre so all the actual
B	passed all the houses yeah
A	so all the streets actually used to be water like almost like Venice
B	yeah yeah
A	er and then
C	I didn't realise that it was in English it's interesting really
B	mm yeah
F	yeah
C	don't know if they're trying to sell it abroad
A	oh I think it's just
F	is it an academic publication?
C	no idea
B	oh
A	and here you are that's
F	is it English publishing?
A	that's our house there
C	don't think so
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so narrow
C	it's very narrow
A	quite small
B	is it three or two storeys?
A	no so that's two two storeys
B	two storeys yeah
A	but it's it's illegal to do three but we're ah do you see that there? that's the theatre of puppets
B	ah
A	and then
B	so you go in from the street do you?
A	we go in
C	yeah
A	that's ours that's ours there
B	street level
A	yeah so we go in at the street
B	yeah
A	then that's our
E	nana sent you a present?
A	then that's our second floor
F	what's that? oh more more dogs
B	oh yeah
A	so
B	oh and what is that is that a dragon?
A	it's a no I think that's a phoenix maybe
F	it's nice I'll add it to my collection
E	I had I had paracetamol cos I had a week's holiday with dad
A	there's a
C	it's amazing and they've they've done this thing on the
B	looks a bit like a dragon
A	yeah yeah
C	is it the one where they're painting where they've turned the staircase into the beak of the?
A	no no it's just erm
C	okay
A	so that's the house opposite ours
B	ah look at that
A	beautiful isn't it? yeah and that's all stained glass there it's very nice
B	oh oh oh well there must be somewhere then they made all these tiles local
A	yeah yeah it's the town where the airport is called
C	really famous for tiles
A	for ceramics
B	cos there's tiles everywhere
A	yeah they bake them in the oven and it's quite a
B	ah do they do they do it now? do they make tiles now?
B	no
C	nearly all of the houses that have the tiles are protected like you can't touch the tiles
A	by the government
B	no
A	and there those that's a close up of our tiles there
B	oh yeah
D	so you can't touch your tiles?
C	oh we can we found out we're not sure I'm not sure if I believe it
B	they're beautiful aren't they?
A	yeah well we've had contradictory information
C	it said that the house is protected but it's only protected in terms of height
A	it's a
C	so we can't go over two storeys
D	oh oh
C	so if we wanted to we could pull down the entire house and rebuild in that patch of land but only to two storeys
A	no I don't think you could touch the I don't think you can touch the the front
C	I don't think you could
E	no
B	oh that's nice the curved windows
A	yeah yeah very nice isn't it? don't know where that is
C	but someone was telling me no my Spanish teacher was telling me she has a friend who lives in the area and one of her tiles fell off
D	yeah
C	and she had an absolute nightmare cos I think she the instead of trying on secretly to try and fix it and contact
D	yeah
C	I think she might have publically said she had a problem and then the council came in and said it's protected you can't do this
D	yeah yeah
A	we tried to put er we tried we had to change our fuse box cos cos it's a hundred year old house they didn't they didn't used to have a fridge in the kitchen
D	yeah
A	they had a gas oven and the only electricity they used for what was it for? they had they
C	yeah yeah
A	in the kitchen so that means electricity went in from the front of the house where the electricity came from
D	yeah
A	cos it came from the street to the back of the house there was just enough for one thing so we could either have the kettle on but not the toaster or the fridge running but not an oven
D	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	so we had to like change the fuse and then
C	the they upped the voltage didn't they?
A	the owner said legally you need to put the fuse box outside on the street cos it's health and safety but then he looked at the tiles and said no they're probably protected so you've got special dispensation to put it in but where the kitchen is at the back of the lower floor of the house
D	yeah
A	used to be the bathroom as well so you used to have a toilet right next to the kitchen
C	in the kitchen
D	oh okay yeah
A	with no particular wall any or anything
A	when they when they first built it
C	and when we were explaining it to people talking to to builders and saying so we need to take out the old kitchen just so you know there's a toilet every every time people were like sorry? there's a there's a toilet in the kitchen? I think you've got the wrong word in Spanish no no there's a toilet
A	it's weak isn't it?
F	yeah
B	I was going to say
C	there was different paints that they'd obviously used and different wall papers
B	what was his name?
A	is that the messenger or Eres is it with the trumpet who is the Greek guy with the trumpet?
C	Hermes
F	yeah it was
A	Hermes
B	yeah
A	and there's some of
B	that's on a wall is it? yeah
A	yeah yeah and there's some of Cleopatra as well for some reason?
B	oh
C	that's really near us so when you come it's just over the road
B	so all the streets must have the same? you know what I mean there's all there's all modern houses in between
A	well there are but they're not in the book
B	ah
A	I would say sixty-seventy per cent of the houses are like these but you do
B	yeah so imagine if you're walking down the street yeah
A	yeah I but there are there are tower blocks
C	are there any
A	but they can
C	I think so
A	so in the city centre you'd get twenty-five story tower blocks really really tall but in this area
unknown_female	ah
unknown_female	there's a law to say they can't
C	are there pictures in there of those that couple of
A	I dunno I haven't really given it a proper proper look yet
B	but they're so pretty
A	they're nice aren't they?
B	so pretty
C	it's getting more and more popular for tourists you
B	oh look at that
A	yes I've been there
D	no no yeah
C	and people are taking a photo I was like hello
unknown_female	mm
F	you should charge em
C	yeah
E	well
C	that could be something to to consider
unknown_female	doing an English tour
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	finding out some stories cos I bet there's some amazing stories
D	yeah
B	that's nice from the front
F	do a walking tour
C	yeah
E	yeah but wherever we go we like to do a walking tour
C	yeah
unknown_female	because they've got them in the city centre
A	even more intricate the more expensive they were like look at all the different patterns
C	and they've just started doing you know the you can do those free walking tours?
B	yeah
C	and you pay a donation at the end
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	which I
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I've always really enjoyed we've done a few really good ones
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	they've just started doing that in the city centre
B	that's a beautiful door
unknown_female	yeah
C	but yeah no one's going round
D	no
C	that could be quite a new there's a new hostel not far
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	that one that's open on
C	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	now erm in Europe have free walking tours
D	yeah
A	so they don't have to pay any tax to the government they don't need a licence because it's free
C	yeah
A	and it'll be put on the internet meet you by the fountain at eleven o'clock
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	this one will be English twelve o'clock for the German one one o'clock for the French one
D	yeah
A	and they'll be maybe we've done it in a few places
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and it'll be twenty people twenty tourists maybe usually younger people cos you need to know the internet for
A	and then they give the tour and it's always been interesting
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	they've always known exactly what they're talking about
unknown_female	yeah mm
unknown_female	and their English has been fantastic but at the end they'll pass a hat round and say you know any
C	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	any tips so you put five euros in but obviously like
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	she's not technically being paid so she doesn't technically have to get the licence or tell the government
B	no
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	so they're not free well you could some people have walked off haven't they?
C	yeah
A	some people are like free two-hour tour and at the end just
D	don't pay
C	and you see sometimes people are are just putting down
A	but then if you get if you've got twenty people and you get a fiver from each of em that's a lot
C	if they give a fiver rather than coins
A	no but still like I'm saying that's fifty quid an hour or something that's decent money
C	yeah we went on one where at the end they said they took us all for dinner
A	no
C	they didn't pay for it but they took us to a really good place
A	they said here's a good restaurant and it's very cheap and it was nice a cheap but she got a free meal from the like she must have
C	but we would have never found that if we'd been on our own
A	no she she was nice
C	it was a bit embarrassing kind of walking in and then another tour of the same company walked in and you could see the staff just kind of going oh hell tourists
A	yeah
C	like being guided in like sheep but I was like I'm quite happy the food's really good
A	completely
E	well good food
C	yeah
E	and you wouldn't have found it yourself
A	I think the pub was happy with it as well
E	what's the problem isn't it?
A	you weren't forced to do the to it
C	and then on the other one we went on two in a day cos we enjoyed it so much in the morning we came back for their afternoon
E	yeah that's right
C	the communist one which was relay good that Budapest one was good
B	that's very pretty
D	so where are you going on your holidays this year then?
A	well all the al the focus is on the house really cos you've still got to do a bit of work but er we applied for tickets for the European championship in France you know Wales qualified but I think everyone in the family applied for tickets really
E	on the house
D	oh yeah yeah
A	and I don't think anyone got one I think
D	yeah
A	he's talking about renting or buying a campervan and then driving down
D	yeah
A	cos he in the south of France so if you go to the south of France I might get a bus up and meet him so that might be a few days to holiday
B	oh I've heard about that I've heard about that
A	yeah that's a good plan though don't you think?
C	it's not that far really
D	no
A	do you see those bungalows?
C	if he wants to drive from Valencia to the about six seven hours yeah
A	so they're real real old-fashioned traditional ones and there's only about twenty or thirty left
B	ah
A	and that's the area is named after those that type of
B	oh yeah
A	but there's hardly any left
B	so then what's that then? that looks
A	I don't know if that's the same building or actually I don't know
B	I mean if that's a bungalow that looks a couple of storeys
A	yeah but if that might be I don't know if that's attached to the same house it might be
B	oh yeah
A	it might be cos it's the same colour
B	so it's the original yeah
A	erm nice innit?
B	yeah it's very nice that is the streets are beautiful
D	mm
A	yeah it's like a little still has ciesta it's like a little village really it still quite traditional
B	yeah
C	everything shuts Saturday at twelve that's it you won't see any any thing till till Monday
B	and a lot of green and a lot of blue
A	yeah because there's no outside space so their their balcony is their garden
E	you want me to start getting ready?
A	cos they don't have they don't have the
B	they don't have a garden no no have you have you got a garden?
A	have we got one? no no in the last one we had a terrace which obviously you can't grow anything but you can have plant pots and stuff and we had quite a lot
B	so is is your kitchen in the back?
A	yeah
B	so where do you go from the kitchen if there's no bathroom?
A	it goes erm to the person's house behind us
B	ah
A	so they're all really like you quite close next to each other cos in Spain unless you're like
B	are they back and back?
A	yeah yeah it's terraced so in Spain unless you live in the country you don't have a garden at all
B	no no no
A	they're just not used to it
B	and then there's the street in the front?
A	yeah yeah but also cos of cos of where it is in Spain the grass it's not really grass like we would think it's not like the grass you'd see out here it's very arid
B	yeah
A	and nothing really naturally grows unless you unless you water it and you put in plant food and stuff
B	yeah
A	in the north it's greener and it rains a lot more but in like Valencia the grass is missing isn't it?
B	but you could have potted plants couldn't you?
D	yeah yeah
C	so
D	I suppose you get a few British students
C	pardon?
D	get a few British students do you?
C	er yeah cos they do erm this thing where you can go and spend one term in a different country so there's a few British people there cos the Spanish love their football so they play a lot of it and then cos we're near the beach
D	yeah
C	really the main things we're seeing is people playing volleyball
D	oh yeah yeah
C	running things like that really not playing a lot of sport not playing a lot of football on the beach
B	you could water them
A	yeah on the balcony we have haven't we?
C	yeah
A	and a few like cactuses more than anything else
B	oh yeah
A	but hopefully in the summer we can build like a staircase to the roof and use the roof and like flatten the roof and use that as like a bit of a sunbathing spot but also like we'd make it into a not a garden because we'd have no grass down but like put a few plants and
B	you could have pots pots
C	we'll have to cover it a little bit because in the summer it would be really hot
A	yeah
B	look at this dear that's beautiful beautiful streets
D	let's have that
C	so there's a few I'll show you which one our house is in there
D	this is it is it?
C	yeah er show you a good page so that's the sort of street but all those houses have different coloured tiles and they're all similar like this they're all kind of erm straight on the street and almost like a terrace really
D	yeah
C	and then ours is forty there that's our house
D	oh oh very nice
C	so ours is just the door and then one window at the side and that's the front room
D	yeah yeah
C	this one looks a bit bigger really it's kind of got a bit more space between the doors but they're all erm there's a few more we've seen that looked the same size as ours but they all change in different sizes like you can see
D	yes
C	like this is a really famous one in the area because it's got this beautiful mosaic at the top
D	oh yeah
C	I think there's another one of our house there so that's a close up of our tiles
D	oh yeah oh very pretty tiles
C	yeah but there's some beautiful ones I don't know if you can see
D	are these three stories then?
C	yeah so some of them are three storeys some of them are two storey I think it depends on what street you're on
D	yeah
C	but I don't I think I can show you one where it's got the some that have Egyptian tiles and erm
D	oh yeah
C	so they're the old fisherman houses
D	yeah
C	it's very pretty it's very colourful
D	mm
C	and it's one of the only places in the city where people live in houses not in flats
D	oh yeah
C	see there you see the Egyptian like kind of like a pharaoh
D	yeah oh yeah
C	but yeah normally people are living in flats big flats
D	yeah yeah
E	oh right
A	and then it's on the it's on the beach as well so we've got the beach not far away
B	well there yeah yeah yeah and if you are near the sea the sand would stop a lot growing as well
A	yeah it's and it damages the wood a lot it really it brings out the damp as well so we've had to buy an anti-damp machine like a machine that sucks the water out the air and fills up fall up about two pints of water in an afternoon
B	what you have one in the house?
A	yeah because there was mould growing on the on the walls but honestly it'll be it'll be two pints of water collected after a few hours and that's what you're like breathing in and stuff and that's what's going on the walls so
B	we've got a slight problem like that
A	yeah yeah
B	the wallpaper is coming away
A	bubbling is it?
B	and
A	yeah
B	then in the night when it cools down
A	yeah
B	we haven't got enough air cos the furniture is
A	okay
B	and when the cold air falls
A	yeah yeah
B	it's damp cos when you touch the wall it's dry
A	right okay
B	so he's got one of the boys that works for them is er he's going to put his radiator on that wall
A	so is is it because there's no circulation of air then?
B	no and
A	right okay
B	and because we have the chairs there
A	yeah yeah
B	so what they're going to do now is put a radiator under those two windows
A	okay
B	and we're going to move the
A	the sofa
B	sit in at that end and the table down there
A	ah okay
B	so as you were saying it's the circulation
A	yeah yeah
B	we didn't have enough and the walls are so thick so
A	that'll take you a long time to get used to I think cos you probably had the table in that end forever
B	well what we used to do years ago in the summer I put the table in the front in the sun
A	okay yeah yeah
B	and the furniture that way
A	okay yeah yeah
B	and then in the winter we moved to be near the radiator
A	okay
B	so
A	how old is the house
B	about a hundred and ten
A	yeah? has it got that written anywhere?
B	no I don't think it has
A	cos lot of houses
B	but then there's that photograph there in the hall
A	yeah
B	oh the street as it was in whatever sort of year
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and er it was another point we were saying you know the floor of our living room
A	mm
D	you don't have to tell me
B	is up above the garden
E	right we're thinking of making a move
A	yeah yeah
F	right
B	we haven't we haven't got any earth or anything hitting that wall
A	right okay yeah yeah
B	so so anyway we had this chap down
A	we he's got contacts hasn't he
B	well all the ones that work for his firm
A	yeah for the housing yeah
B	they're all trades people
A	yeah
E	are you alright?
D	yeah
A	right okay yeah yeah yeah
B	so he came down
F	we'll have to take our car and put the dogs in the boots
B	there's no damp so so we're having that done
A	cos that that's easier than damp though to treat isn't it?
E	here you are that's you're your patio still open?
H	yeah
B	oh look at that once we get the radiator there so that we've got no cold air
A	yeah
B	and we've got a bit of air the dining table won't stop the air
F	come on
A	yeah I think damp is something that never really gets better isn't it? you can just
B	well no cos it can come from below and it can come in from the wall
A	yeah
B	I've got a handbag somewhere I don't know if I brought it over the door oh
