A	no I've not had any yet
B	have you not?
A	no it looks good though that melon
B	mm helicopter
A	where? oh yeah
B	must be new we're not seeing the
A	no no
B	I don't want to pay thirty pounds to see it
A	what time is it?
B	mm
A	that's two D
B	oh right what time is it now?
A	twelve
B	twelve?
A	yeah
B	right we'll see the twelve twenty-one will we?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	okay let's head off then
A	if that's the right cinema I'm looking at anyway
B	yeah there is an Imax there now
A	mm but it should be if Imax has got standard size doesn't it?
B	I know you would think
A	you'd be disappointed if you went to the Imax and it was just like a normal screen
B	yeah especially with the prices they charge
B	shouldn't we?
A	no
B	you did?
A	yeah I should have done
B	yeah although I don't think you're going to be seeing a lot of sun in the cinema
B	are you?
A	yeah
B	oh am I going the right way now?
B	eh?
A	I don't know if he told you but they sent him a letter
B	well he he didn't but I mean he was saying on the way oh
A	yeah
B	and then I had a look at it and I thought oh right and then erm I think grandad explained that he did send away
A	yeah the the documents
A	cos he got a letter on Monday and our postman comes at midday sometimes our postman comes at three o clock in the afternoon so that's when we got this letter and it was like oh if you don't send us these photocopies you may be charged but even if you do send us these photocopies you still may be charged if you're not eligible erm so yeah anyway we've not got so grandad had to go yesterday to
B	oh yeah so they must have a note on the system cos she said oh you need to be interviewed by another supervisor or erm
A	yeah
B	and to you know wait for the interview but this this receptionist a little bit of information she gets it all blown out of proportion she starts saying
A	I know yeah
B	she starts making up her own things
A	that's what reception oh right did you? you know that? you know that reception?
A	well cos you know when we went to the doctor's and they wouldn't take us? and then we were and
B	yeah
B	yeah I know
A	and then the surgery said oh no it never happened they never came in
B	mm
A	well mammy left a review on the NHS website for that surgery and she said how disappointed she was with the receptionist that they didn't take them on
B	mm
A	and she the the surgery replied and said I'm sorry but you weren't in our catchment area so they actually acknowledged that we went on the website so now mammy is sending a formal complaint she's written an email
B	yeah now they've admitted it yeah
A	yeah cos now they've admitted that she's been
B	mm
B	well it just shows you that
A	yeah
B	they went in said oh he's going to have to pay and I said well erm he's he he's an E U citizen
A	yeah
B	and she said oh that that doesn't mean he doesn't have to pay he that doesn't give you everything erm I said well I've got a a card and when I go to Europe I I I thought that I could have whatever treatment's needed and she said no no that'll just cover a consultation
B	I said oh right oh I didn't know that
A	no
B	and then it got me thinking oh maybe
A	yeah
B	cos then she said oh when I was in Amsterdam erm I had to go and see a doctor and I had to pay but it didn't you know it it just covered me for the erm
A	yeah
B	so then erm
A	you pay for it over here as well
B	well well you pay a a set fee
A	yeah yeah
B	but in other European countries a lot of them you pay whatever the medicine costs
A	yeah
B	and I said well yeah in lots of European countries you have to pay for a prescription that's what that
A	yeah
B	so she wasn't charged for treatment cos she probably didn't have treatment so you know? she's just making things up herself cos I said well he's you know? he's he's got the card and said oh that's er that doesn't mean this is very expensive you know? and I said yeah but we have a reciprocal arrangement with EU countries and she said erm well no no you can't just have anything if if if you just have them treated being allowed to be treated for anything we'd be full of people coming over for treatment
B	it's just making up our own thing
A	yeah but you'd get treated for free at home
B	I I mean I can't quite
A	yeah yeah
B	so your grandad's thinking oh well can they invoice me? I'll go and see the medical people that I've got back home in
A	yeah
B	kind of indicated that he might have to pay because
A	yeah
B	it said if you're not normally resident
A	yeah
B	I thought you know I can't believe this yeah
A	it's ridiculous isn't it?
B	so then anyway this this
A	yeah
B	erm Monday but she said okay if you've got the
B	it's she didn't mention anything oh you might have to pay you have to pay erm you know? and this receptionist
A	I know
B	they're they're bloody
A	I know yeah
B	they think they have you know? they they
A	like whenever whenever we ring up for the doctor's they're like oh so what is it that's wrong? and then if you tell them they're like right well we can't that doesn't sound very serious so we can't make erm
B	so they have to be half dead?
A	yeah well
B	well you know? I think they are told by doctors now to ask that it's a bit intrusive isn't it?
A	yeah
B	especially if you just walk in and just want to make an appointment
A	yeah
B	and you have to say what's wrong in front of the waiting room
A	you
B	mm
A	because erm I don't know what I was going in for it think it was something around my ear or something
B	mm
A	and erm it didn't hurt or anything but it was a bit fuzzy or something the sound
B	mm
A	and erm
B	jesus
A	and then so mammy was like yeah but she's in a lot of pain you know? she can't sleep at night and she's like oh oh right then you can come in this morning
B	mm
B	so you just have to tell them you're in pain
A	yeah but then when you go into the doctor's it's just like they don't mind like
B	yeah
A	they they don't know what you've said
B	yeah
A	and the receptionist thinks oh you know? like but like for all like if someone's going in and they're like not necessarily in pain and they can see something that's wrong with them and then the receptionist like oh no you're going to have to wait two they might be in agony by the time they've waited two weeks
B	yeah
A	they don't know what it is
B	I think it is it I mean they do have problems cos I think it is sort of a lot of people go in there's nothing wrong with the and they're just trying to weed out people aren't they? so I know why they're doing it but it's very frustrating if if you do have a problem and it's like they're trying to not see you isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but if you look up anything online it's like you should have this seen by a doctor
B	yeah well that's why you shouldn't look anything up online
B	should just go to the doctor if you're ill don't
A	no but if you look up something and you're like oh right I've had like a pain or something
B	yeah but if you look up anything
B	if you don't get seen go to the doctor immediately
A	no they don't always no but some
B	well well a lot of the time they do
A	no but sometimes there's something and it's like oh
B	yeah it's a it's it could be nothing or you could be about to have a brain haemorrhage
B	so you better go immediately
B	cos that's probably for a headache or
A	yeah
B	oh
A	really?
B	I think she called an ambulance out er
A	yeah
B	she had a problem breathing so they came out to the ambulance and they said oh can't find anything wrong it must be just a panic attack
B	she had pains in her chest but then afterwards it carried on so she went to the doctor's
A	yeah
B	and the doctor checked her chest and said well there doesn't seem to be anything there I'll give you some antibiotics cos he heard like a rattling noise
A	yeah
B	when he was listening to her chest and assumed it must be an infection and then erm
A	yeah
B	or so she rang him I think had a phone consultation or something so he arranged for her to have an X ray
B	there's a hole in it so it's amazing isn't it?
A	I know
B	cos I mean I guess pains in your chest and problem breathing they must have listened to her heart and checked if there was any problems there
A	mm
B	so it wasn't until they did the X ray cos it continued that and they say tall young skinny females it can happen to them
A	mm
B	I don't know whether it's cos of your rib cage
A	maybe
A	cos it's unusual that cos usually you can get a punctured lung if you break a rib
B	well yeah I thought
A	yeah
B	you know? it's usually only if you've had an accident
A	yeah you break a rib and then it punctures your lung yeah
B	but yeah supposedly tall and skinny sort of slim young girls get it
A	yeah maybe yeah maybe if you've got like quite erm
A	if you're not like you're necessarily like skinny as in like lost weight or something but like have a generally skinny frame
A	do you know what I mean? cos some people do yeah
B	so they had to cut a hole in her side and put something on it to let
A	er
B	cos there was air building up on her side of her her lung and have to let the air escape so it's not worked it's like something
A	yeah
B	if you have got a persistent something that's not going away you need to make sure you persist and say well this isn't still a problem
A	yeah because there was this child erm and their parents took them to six different doctors and each one said there's nothing wrong with them some of them said it's a flu some of them said it was
B	really?
A	yeah and they went to six different doctors
B	mm
A	I know but
B	but everyone seems to be having medical problems
B	yeah they gave her erm a sedative
B	so erm be like a local anaesthetic but you're awake
B	well they're reluctant to do that unless it's absolutely necessary because that can cause complications in itself having an anaesthetic
A	I know but
B	some people react against it can have an effect on your heart on you know?
A	yeah
B	now they're not they're a bit more reluctant now they tend to give keep you awake for a lot of stuff unless it's kind of a major operation I think
A	I just don't know how people do it while they're awake
B	I think
A	oh does she want them out?
B	well she's always off
A	oh from tonsillitis
B	and er so they think that it's best to have them out cos she's keep getting it back all the time
A	oh I'd rather just suffer I wouldn't have them out
B	well no it's a routine operation if you're if you're having tonsillitis all the time then you would want them out cos it's not good
A	no because nothing's worse than having an operation
B	well no it's
A	cos
B	you don't know anything though do you?
A	well they do they get a knife
B	but you don't know anything about that do you?
A	course you do oh do they put you asleep for that?
B	I would imagine they would
A	cos they don't for erm
B	maybe they don't
A	a
B	mm yeah it's considered routine as well now so it's possible that they don't
B	why would you? you wouldn't feel anything
A	no but you would know I would just be like screaming
B	why?
A	cos I'm getting cut open
B	yeah but you don't know do you?
A	yeah but I do because they've just told me they're about to cut me open
A	it's awful er I don't wanna be
B	the only problem is if you're in pain and if it's not going to cause you pain then I don't see the problem with it they're doing it to help you
B	it's not as if they're doing it oh let's just cut this little girl open for no reason
B	then you'd have reason to scream
A	I'm
B	why?
A	I don't know I was born like this
B	you weren't born like this
A	of course I was
B	you've never had a problem with doctors and hospitals when you were a toddler
A	yeah I probably didn't know what was going on
B	no you wouldn't have done
B	so you weren't born like that were you?
A	what?
B	you weren't born like that
A	well because I was born without knowledge
B	well I don't think anyone would tell you that when you were young
A	yeah well they yeah but now because people tell me like oh right so you know this is what I I like it's because it's cos I've been educated
B	no it's a it's a it's a matter of
B	it is cos if it's the right thing and the good thing for you you shouldn't fear anything
A	no because it's like inside the body it's horrible I just want to rip everything out
A	why?
B	it's stupidity
B	well your body is your body is what it needs to be kept in working order
B	and if they need to go in there and sort it out sometimes then that's the right thing to do
A	er but it's awful
B	it's your body why is it awful?
A	because ever since ever since I've learned ever since I've had biology lessons I've been like this ever since I was
B	yeah you haven't said what's cause that it's cos you've learned about
A	in what's inside the body yeah that's what's caused it but it's not like eh obviously if I never knew what was I wouldn't be that bothered would i?
A	it's as soon as they teach you like oh inside you you have blood and it's like
B	so you'd rather be ignorant?
A	yeah I would I would rather not know if I'd never known that I have like
A	I don't know it's an irrational fear isn't it? it's irrational
B	well you need to start being more rational
B	I'm sure I have yeah
A	oh yeah mm next time you're scared of something I'm going to be start being more rational
B	well yeah it's good advice
A	I think most people have irrational
B	mm
A	and to be honest it's not that irrational if you're going to have an
B	well it's alright to have a little bit of an inkling of
B	of apprehensiveness but it's busy in here look at this
A	why?
B	cos it's the holidays isn't it?
B	well you know what it is? It's cos they do the kids club early morning
A	yeah but that's ten
B	no yeah they'll be coming out now won't they? at twelve? they're all just coming out
A	all these human beings everywhere
B	you sound like an alien who wants to wipe all the humans off the
A	I probably am you know?
B	yeah maybe you don't have blood and all
A	yeah I know
B	maybe you've got something else
A	yeah I'm an alien
