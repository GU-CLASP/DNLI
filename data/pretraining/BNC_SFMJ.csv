B	yeah
C	I love watching it
B	yes
C	look at that tree
B	yeah and yeah and the aerials
C	yes
B	yeah
C	through
B	yeah
C	through there as well I like that
B	yes yes
B	actually I thought
B	it occurred to me
C	I'd love to go to
A	oh sweet
A	sweet
C	although
A	it only took us how long did it take us?
B	oh just over an hour
A	yeah
B	I mean it's very little amazingly little just by
C	well when we went on the train it was super
B	oh
C	easy
B	yeah
C	that was going dunno it was like going somewhere in
B	yeah I'm sure it just took an hour to get down erm
C	well this is why I thought I want to do a day trip to
B	yeah but we could go in the car
C	yes
B	what thinkest thou?
A	uhu
A	have to get up early
C	we would actually
B	well
C	mm
B	what do you call early anyway?
C	I might be a little grumpy
A	nineish?
C	well
B	yeah
B	well you're I mean as long as you left by eleven so long as
C	yeah
B	you left by eleven
C	so that would be quicker than going say to visit see
B	oh much quicker
B	yeah
C	that's bizarre isn't it?
A	well we should invite
B	yeah
C	well we'll play it by ear see
B	yeah
C	how we feel but I think that's a very good idea
B	yeah
C	there's a lovely second hand bookshop that I'd like to go to
B	would it be open on a Sunday?
C	I don't oh
B	oh I know I know the bookshop you mean actually yes
C	yeah
B	yes
C	cos things still close in
C	and I forget that
C	and it's not holiday season
B	no
C	true
B	no exactly
C	good point
B	yeah
C	mm mm we could check things on the internet
B	yeah
C	or we could
B	you've got nobody living down there now have you? they still own a house don't they?
C	yeah we have got someone living down there
B	oh yeah because
C	but I think she won't be there
B	yeah
C	she'll probably be in
A	why?
C	because it's my mum's thing
B	oh right yes
C	so I sent her but I've sent her
B	and that's her grandmother
C	yes
B	yes
C	that's her grandmother
B	yeah yeah so what are they actually doing are they taking her out for a meal or what?
C	no they're going to the care home
B	uhu
C	and I'm not sure really
B	yeah
C	I thought
B	probably having a birthday cake
C	well yes but my mum's just going to be daunted by the whole thing really and I thought it didn't really sound like a very good idea actually because
B	oh
C	cos I thought she's sort of not gonna know who anybody is
B	mm yeah
C	well
B	yes
C	and I thought she's certainly not gonna know who I am if I go there
B	yeah yeah
C	and she doesn't need another person well you know
B	yeah
C	it's more for the children than er than her really
B	yes yes
C	so
B	photographs with grandma or maybe great great grandma?
C	yeah
B	yeah?
C	well it will be hold on no would be great
B	does your mum have any
C	great?
B	great?
C	she's got one on the way

A	uhu
B	who are the others?
B	why? why?
B	who are the others?
A	mm
B	yeah
B	how many do your the people who used to live next door to you in
C	how many what?
B	children do they have?
C	two now
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	Look at the Harlequins
C	mm
A	uhu
C	it looks really nice so we're lacking books on the two top shelves
A	it's cos I don't read small paperbacks is the issue
C	so they're never going to get filled then what are gonna do about that
A	well I could try and find some editions of books I read that are smaller
C	mm
A	it's just miscalculated
B	this is well calculated though why didn't you do them the same?
C	yeah
A	well mix and match we just didn't match as much as we mixed
C	well we needed to match what
B	yeah the
C	we own
B	it it fits
C	mm
B	the I mean obviously it would take a paperback
C	yes
B	you know a standard paperback
C	yeah but
B	yeah he doesn't like paperbacks
C	important books
B	yeah yeah
B	no
C	from WH Smith's
B	mm
C	well actually paperbacks are quite big aren't they really?
A	well they
C	in WH Smith those are quite small
B	well they can be big yes
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yes
B	up there rather than a
C	yeah
B	a soft covered
C	mm
B	a soft covered hard book if you see what I mean
C	yes
B	so I've been working away at my Greek
C	yes
B	hey
C	are you going to take a GCSE in it?
B	do you know I I've downloaded the the syllabus
C	yes
B	for that?
C	well it's a good thing to
B	yeah
C	aim for cos it makes you
B	yeah
C	do it doesn't it?
B	yes yeah
C	erm
A	did you bring the coriander?
B	yes I did er
C	presumably that nice cosy pub is open did you go to the nice cosy pub in
A	which pub?
C	well what's it called? the one that's got the erm homebrewed beer or something
A	mm that's nice it's called something like
C	cos we need if we go there we need places to go
B	yes yeah
A	could go to the
B	otherwise we won't
A	we'd go to the
B	have much fun
A	pub right on the coast
B	I mean to be down at the water even on I mean on a day like this would be quite dramatic actually
C	it's gonna be
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	very cold
A	then we could go for fish and chips
C	mm
B	oh yes
A	by the erm
C	oh I wonder if that caf√©'s open by the sea the one that we sat in and looked at the sea
B	and you took photographs
C	what's that one called?
A	er yes that would be open that's a nice walk to get round to too
C	yeah oh I could look at my dream house as well
B	I thought that was up in Campbeltown
A	that was mine
C	no I've got a dream house in
B	oh right
C	but I'm suggesting we should go on holiday to these places and then we can look at them for fun
B	yeah
C	yes
B	erm
C	well we could we could sell this place and not have a mortgage we could buy a place in Scotland with the change
B	yeah
C	he'll have to I don't know
B	you've got
B	why won't you want to become a teacher?
A	I've no inclination to
C	you'd be an excellent primary school teacher you've be very funny
B	yeah you would be a very good primary teacher
C	yeah
B	actually yeah
C	he's not got the inclination to do it though have you
A	no
C	he just doesn't want to
B	no
C	so that's that
B	the one member of the
C	it's traditional
B	yeah
B	he's managed to avoid it
C	I wonder if
B	well yes
C	as well
B	yeah
C	mm what's
B	yeah
C	what's she going?
B	well I asked her you know I said you know
C	oh
B	the top because you know
C	that's one of those
B	oh well that that makes me
C	oh no
B	panic that just makes me
C	yeah
B	panic
C	what are you gonna do?
B	yeah yes
B	yeah
C	stressful thing like
B	and particularly
C	what am I gonna do?
B	yeah particularly in her field when there's
C	yeah I know
B	you know it's not that
C	there must be nothing
C	in that
B	yes yeah
C	erm well though
B	and and
C	but then everything is competitive
B	yeah
C	now
B	oh yes
C	and it's more competitive than it ever was
B	yes
C	it's ridiculously
B	yeah
C	even for real starter jobs
B	yes yes
C	you know really crappy mundane jobs
B	yeah yeah
C	there's loads of competition
B	a huge amount of
C	and they expect this sort of level of
B	yeah
C	brilliance it's just awful it's worse than it ever was
B	yeah
C	so if you're a young person now I mean in a way it puts it off for three years doesn't it? if you do a degree it kind of puts off
B	well it it it
C	the decision
B	it puts it off yes
C	yeah
B	yes but erm yeah but you know when I was qualifying as er in pure science
C	mm
B	er there were science erm what do you call them?
B	exhibitions if you like
C	oh
B	when all the employers
C	okay
B	came up to
C	were there
B	university
C	to recruit
B	and there were booths around all the places ICI Courtaulds Ferranti's
C	mm
B	every single er thing that employed scientists
C	okay
B	and they were more or less saying you know we we are
C	come and work for us
B	we've got these jobs that are available
C	wow
B	would you like? we are we are based in whatever
C	that's nice
B	and just swanned in no I don't I don't want to walk work in Stroud and
C	oh how lovely
B	and you could have left with
C	that wouldn't happen now
B	you know an assured job no
B	and in actual fact Courtaulds
C	yeah
B	it cut off
C	yes
B	really quite quickly
C	yeah
B	er just a few years after I graduated but you know we could have got just
C	and that's science as well
B	anything anywhere
C	I mean
B	yeah
C	art
B	yeah mind you
C	anything artistic
B	if you're a maths teacher or a physics teacher you could walk into a job
C	well that's the thing
B	just like that
C	with being a teacher isn't it? it's
B	yeah
C	you and people always need teachers
B	well exactly yes yeah
C	and so
B	and it's a
C	that is the most sensible thing to go for
B	it's yeah
C	in your life isn't it?
B	it is
C	yeah
B	because you know
C	exactly
B	it's every single town
C	mm
B	has schools yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah what
C	what to do
B	what to yes
B	yeah
C	and how much money do you want?
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	and they're the sort of questions that are
B	mm
C	but the problem is your what you want changes so you might not be bothered about that
B	because after all
C	at a crucial time
B	and your experience is nil
C	yes
B	in a sense you're
C	yeah
B	er it would be easy
C	exactly
B	now to answer
C	no exactly
B	questions and you
C	I know
B	so you can go back and be twenty again
C	and you're not bothered when you're that age
B	yeah no
C	and and those things don't matter like
B	mm mm
C	owning a house
B	yeah
C	doesn't really mean anything
B	no
C	cos you don't know what not owning a house
B	house is yes
C	is
B	is yeah
C	cos it's all there on a plate
B	yeah
C	for you and
B	mm
C	erm and later on it starts to matter and then you haven't done what it takes to get those things
B	things no
C	that was my thing cos I
B	mm
C	I found out later what I wanted and then it's like oh damn it I haven't really
B	haven't
C	haven't sorted it out
B	trod the right steps
C	yeah oh look at this
C	and that
A	it could be that chemical you see
C	we'll have to wash it cos it's well luckily it does wash well
B	yeah
C	well luckily it does wash
B	well did
C	no she didn't
B	no she didn't
C	mention that
B	no
C	oh true cos she'll be back in a year won't she?
B	yeah but mind you they're doing the house they they're certainly but
C	yeah
B	I suspect
C	we might be sofaless
B	well I suspect that she won't
A	we shall see
B	yes yes
C	she might want a new one
B	yes yes or she might see something that's more
C	yeah
B	period like
C	but I do think that you can always take steps at whatever stage in life
B	yeah
C	and so you go I want that what do I have to do to get it? and then you can
B	yes and it's never too late
C	you can do something I mean it's not too late no
B	no
C	I don't think it's ever too late
B	mm oh look at
C	but
B	parents yes yeah we are actually I mean yes yeah
C	and she's got erm obviously
B	her own mum
C	her own mum and she's got her dad
B	yeah
C	and the dad's family
B	yeah yeah
C	so lucky I think
B	yeah
C	she's got all these
B	she's going out to Japan for
C	oh is she?
B	about ten days
C	to Japan
A	it's news to me
B	yeah well it's only been booked
C	otherwise
B	yeah
C	they won't speak to you
B	mm mm
C	it's just so expensive to go
B	yeah I think er I think her flight is something like six hundred
C	mm
B	which actually considering it's as far as that it's er that's pretty
C	yeah
B	pretty good value yeah when we bought fares they were about six hundred cos er we paid about twelve hundred pounds sound alarming doesn't it?
C	gosh
B	half a log burner
C	six hundred pounds we do not have
B	no
C	but if they offer to pay for you
B	I think all their money is now invested in er
C	yeah
A	still don't have a passport
C	oh gosh I've got to renew mine as well
B	yeah you yeah you must well you must you should never be without
C	no
B	an up-to-date passport actually
C	no it's true
B	and sometimes it does take a long long wait
C	well it erm
B	I mean well it's
C	I'm assuming it would
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	mm
B	her passport wasn't long enough for her to go to Japan and because
C	yeah
B	that was the first time she was going for several months
C	mm
B	so I drove her up to
C	mm
B	and for a significant sum of money
C	mm
B	we got it there and then
C	it's ridiculous how
B	yes yeah
C	you have to pay
B	yeah
C	I mean what for? what are you actually paying for? for somebody
B	yeah
C	to shuffle some paper?
C	it's ridiculous
B	a what?
B	is there really?
C	yeah
B	hand my little machine over can you darling?
A	don't just play a silly game though mummy
B	no I'm going to look up
A	you do some absolute rubbish on yours don't you dear?
A	why don't you look up?
B	oh well let's have a look at the weather
A	what's that stain there?
C	no that's what I was asking you
A	bottom
C	it looks like a nasty stain
C	okay
B	nine degrees and six
C	sunny's good
B	whereas today it's saying thick cloud
C	well yes
B	eleven and five and a reasonable wind speed tomorrow the wind is not as strong as this so it says
C	although
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	I like
B	do you? yeah
C	it's less busy
B	yeah
C	but everything's still open you need to live somewhere where everything's open
B	yes
C	I'm gonna have a coffee do you want a coffee at all?
B	no no thanks
C	I'm hungry super hungry
B	they've even found a wooden box
A	yes
B	it must be very cold working there because it's it's mud
A	mm
B	that they're working in what were they about to build there?
A	I don't know
B	well at least they're covered
C	what's that?
B	well this is a Bronze Age place that was burnt down and preserved in silt
C	yeah
B	so even the wood is there
A	would you like a small wine mother?
B	yes
C	mm
B	and there's been an earthquake in Taiwan
C	oh
B	and er
C	oh darling you're so warm and comfy
C	ah these have been very successful
B	oh
A	they're from Skye
C	yes ah
A	well the brown is
C	and they wash and every now and then we wash them don't we? no this one hasn't been washed yet has it?
A	no I'm still not convinced that's real
C	really? oh then that would be trades descriptions
B	are they supposed to be real fur?
C	yeah
B	yeah I always thought the white one was
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	it is
B	and the other one certainly
C	mm
B	in fact apparently the the reverse has been found that people have bought things with collars or whatever
C	yes that are called fake fur
B	as false fur and it's turned
C	yes
B	out that they're real
C	and there's been there's a bit there's a bit of a fuss about that
B	yeah which does seem rather weird
C	cos
B	doesn't it?
C	yes it does
B	and of course people get
C	but people want fake fur
B	yes yeah
C	now
B	yeah
C	I mean fur is lovely
B	yeah I've got a I've got
C	yeah
B	the well a black Persian lamb
C	but you kind of can't well I suppose lamb's not so bad
B	yeah that can't be actually because
C	because
B	you know after we we eat lamb
C	we're eating them anyway
B	yeah exactly so the skin has
C	yeah
B	gotta be used somewhere
C	you might as
B	yeah
C	might as well use it
B	yeah
C	you know oh
B	I suppose if you were wearing a fur coat and you know
C	of an
B	that was something else
C	endangered species
B	then you you could just say this is a Peruvian lamb
C	I mean if you wear a leopard then that's morally
B	yes ah yeah now that's
C	questionable
B	yes that that is actually
C	yeah
B	yes yes
C	now nowadays erm but in the twenties they used to actually kind of almost wear foxes didn't they?
B	oh they did my mother
C	they had a fox around them
B	your mother would have had complete with head
B	my mother my mother
C	yeah
B	had two or three of them actually
C	what a bizarre thing
B	yeah
C	like sort of dead animal round your neck
B	yeah
C	but yeah
B	there it was with its little head
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	has there been any action opposite?
B	no we got quite excited earlier
B	because we actually thought that some people were coming to look at the house and it turned out that they were Jehovah Witnesses or
C	oh
C	bloody Christians
B	er yes exactly yeah
C	I want some action why aren't they coming? it's Saturday
B	no it's not oh yeah it is actually of course it is yeah
C	there's not much going on is there considering
B	no yeah it's er yeah
C	I hope he manages to sell it
B	I think he's
C	he
B	bound to but
C	yeah well I suppose everything takes these things take ages though don't they?
B	well they certainly can yeah
C	but then there's no forward chain on this one there is at least that
B	yeah
C	it's a funny thing a chain isn't it?
B	yes
C	the house chain thing
B	oh it's
C	and it only ends when
B	it's horrendous actually
C	well when does a chain ever
B	end
C	end? if somebody
B	well er it always starts with a
C	had died
B	usually a first time buyer wait a minute we was that yeah
C	so we didn't have a chain no they'd already moved out so I suppose if
B	yeah
C	people move out anyway
B	yeah you you and you were not coming from a chain
C	no that's right
B	if you'd owned
C	yeah
B	then you would have been selling that
C	yeah
B	to somebody else and I suppose
C	and it all has to timed
B	yes oh god yes
C	perfectly
B	and
C	and oh
B	it's very very difficult
C	yeah really difficult
B	actually yeah
C	cos the whole chain's
B	yeah
C	got to be timed
B	yeah cos in actual fact
C	so
B	er
C	but if you chased the if you traced the chain it would go everywhere wouldn't it?
B	yeah well
C	it would be like a house here a house there a house there
B	yeah oh yeah could be all
C	yeah
B	all over the place yeah when we sold number
C	oh that's nice
B	to to introduce
C	yeah
B	and it was for a Sunday morning and er when they er arrived on that Sunday it followed the Saturday when their buyer had a problem with selling their house
C	oh
B	so in actual fact we were going to be exchanging in July
C	yeah
B	and this was the beginning of July
C	yes
B	when there was a problem that
B	rosed it rose its head
C	yeah
B	raised its head
C	yeah
B	over something
C	arose
B	something to do with a path I think actually er
C	oh
B	and it wasn't then until December that we actually exchanging
C	yeah
B	with the with the party
C	yes
B	erm we could
C	but it's so
B	wouldn't exactly be any point in
C	touch and go
B	yeah oh yeah
C	isn't it?
B	yeah
C	right the way through you just never know if it's going to actually happen I suppose
B	mm
C	yeah we were lucky
B	yeah yeah well you were very lucky that you know it was just a straightforward
C	yes it was it was a good first
B	where you're buying a
C	experience really
B	yeah
C	really straightforward
B	yeah
C	erm the only non-straightforward thing was getting sort of gazumped but I don't think that was real
B	do you not?
C	do you remember when someone else? no
B	I need your help
C	and then we ended up paying another thousand
B	yeah
C	I mean what's another
B	well yeah
C	it's ridiculous
B	but er I I mean I don't well I I think that would be extremely er what's the word? unprofessional of
C	oh true
B	of er
C	no I don't know
B	of anybody to do that
C	I don't know
B	yeah
C	that's what
B	mm
C	I'm going to get my coffee
B	right
C	well you think that our gazump wasn't real don't you?
B	have I checked what dear?
C	Rightmove I just wondered if
B	not today er I did yesterday
B	let me just have another look actually
C	but it does seem empty next door
B	it does yes
C	there's no action
B	yes exactly
C	nothing
B	nobody's been
C	yeah
B	er you know and I've been here all morning so
C	no one's coming and going
B	no
C	and there's no car
B	let's just have look
C	but that road looks so much nicer doesn't it?
B	oh yes I mean that's made an absolute
C	yeah it's it's actually made the whole road look
B	look much better
C	more
B	yeah
C	all we need is to get oh the bins are never gonna go are they? I'm not even gonna hope for that
B	oh yeah
C	that door is horrible
A	right the soup's ready we'll just let it get to a more reasonable temperature
B	the
A	you have a seat dear
B	you know the number of houses that are for sale here for half a million in the area an amazing number of them
C	mm are are they going are they
B	er no they're not actually
C	the the gap
B	I'm er I they're all in
C	yeah
A	that that's near
C	that's
B	and that's a a five hundred guide price
C	really?
B	yeah
C	how many bedrooms is that?
B	erm four double bedrooms arranged over three floors you know
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	you see this one they would call four bedrooms I think
B	they would they'd probably call your study
C	they'd have to
B	a bedroom you know
C	well because yeah they would because otherwise it's not a true reflection of the size of the house
B	yeah
C	if they say it's a two bedroomed house that's
B	yeah
C	not going to reflect
B	yeah
C	what it is but it's just that the standard is doing it by how many bedrooms isn't it?
B	yeah
C	but they should almost have a different system shouldn't they than what is it? it's a study it's two
B	yes yes
C	two reception rooms
B	I mean actually I think it's best described as wait a minute one two three reception rooms study two bedrooms
C	yeah
B	and a bathroom you know
C	three reception rooms
C	study
B	yeah
C	but they'd have to call at least one of those reception rooms a bedroom cos of the standard
B	well
C	way that they do it wouldn't they?
B	yeah and I think they'd call downstairs a bedroom
B	yeah
C	sad bedroom wouldn't it?
B	yeah
B	well no no I mean the other room the snug they'd call a bedroom
C	yeah well I mean if you were house sharing
B	yeah
C	this would be a bedroom like
B	yeah oh yeah was
C	that was
B	yeah
C	that was a bedroom
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah it's just that
B	yeah yeah they'd have this I mean they'd probably have this as a bedroom and because it's nearer the bathroom
C	and and
B	and that as a sitting room sitting room
C	yes
B	downstairs sitting room
C	yeah
B	study
C	yeah
B	here bedroom kitchen dining room
C	yeah
B	and upstairs two further bedrooms
C	where you
B	and a bathroom
