A	okay
B	yeah you do sneeze quite a lot
A	like at work I've literally been like atchoo atchoo atchoo like all day
B	it's to do with like um allergic
A	I don't know what to do
B	things isn't it? It's cos you're quite a allergic person so
A	yeah but
B	you your
A	gets tiring
B	mm
A	the other morning when you were still asleep I must have sneezed like about twenty times in a row
B	well
A	I was like I'm so tired I don't even think I can get on my bike
B	I dunno if you can is there anything that like medications for that or?
A	I don't know
B	I mean
A	oops
B	there must be something you know if if you Googled or something and might be able to find like a um things that
A	oh except that weird eye
B	reduces sneezing
A	that weird eye thing that I got that was weird when this one of my eyes was like a big pasty
A	do you remember?
B	er you was that  was that  conjunctivitis though?
A	I dunno
B	so you had an eye that just it was it just swollen was it?
A	do you not remember?
B	well there's there's been a few things um
B	conjunctivitis
A	there's always something wrong with you
B	well mm mm yeah er
B	often
A	that's not very nice
B	well no I mean it's just unfortunate that there's usually some kind of I think your immune system or your body has to have something to
A	yeah exactly
B	to worry about
A	it likes being nosey
B	it it has to be worrying about something
B	if you've gone for a long period without any problem or
A	yeah but I'm never very poorly
B	over over this Christmas  over this Christmas  you didn't have anything wrong with you did you
A	yeah and you were like I can't go out today
B	yeah I constantly had a cold didn't I yeah
A	I've got a sniffle
B	constantly had a
A	ah my dad did as well didn't he
B	Cos yeah cos the your parents did then I did then your parents did again or something
A	yeah cos they were bad in like over Hogmanay weren't they like
B	my worst was er there's one when I did look quite bad although
A	when was that?
B	it just kept that thing where you when
A	oh yeah
B	you just get the thing where your eyes and nose are just constantly streaming
A	yeah
B	and you look you know you
A	quite ill
B	you look quite bad but but I think I just wanted to just get through that and
A	yeah
B	I it doesn't normally go on forever
A	well I hope it doesn't normally go on forever
B	like you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	you wouldn't get um wouldn't normally get it er er for like a whole day or something
A	God this blanket
B	so I don't know if there's any medication er that you could take that that sort of
A	well I'm not bothered about it
B	would er reduce that sort of immune
A	not too debilitating
B	immune thing
A	you know in that book? That um Hundred Years of Solitude?
B	yeah
A	you know when she's dying and she like makes hand um handmade
B	yeah
A	and like the day that she finished it is the day that she dies?
B	right
A	I feel like this about this blanket
B	oh
B	yeah it's really big isn't it
A	I'm gonna be like an old lady
B	it's really it's nearly as big as you are
B	I didn't actually mean that in by putting some
A	ah it's too late
B	emphasis on the
A	I've heard that
B	emphasis on your size or something
B	it's nearly as
A	big as a person
B	small as the I can't say
A	yeah
B	it it's getting bigger though isn't it
A	even bigger
B	small as you are
A	no
B	um
A	Don't worry
B	it's nearly as slim as you are
A	it's very silly
B	that'll be er
A	but I think I must still be like crocheting it when I'm a hundred
B	yeah it looks very hard to do that crocheting as if you have to er you go you know just round and round  and round and round  all the time
A	well I'm not doing er very complicated things
B	yeah
A	like some of the things are
B	yeah
A	but this is just like
B	well it looks  it looks  quite complicated
A	yeah but if you look it's all just the same thing over and over  and over and over  again
B	well yeah I can see it's a repeated pattern but it does look pretty you know all those little sort of triangle shapes are
A	no
B	there must be about a thousand or so of these little
A	it's kept me quiet
B	lumpy bits that don't look er that aren't
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and you've gotta go all the way round so
B	oh maybe
A	it would have been expensive
B	oh right
A	this one was from Aldi
B	yeah
A	I went there and it was the guy was like ooo doing a bit of crafting? I went yes please
B	they're er they're very cheap over there aren't they
A	yep
B	and er er it's handy to have the shop there
A	yeah
B	yeah it would be  would be  quite
A	think how much money we would waste
B	annoying to live next to a Waitrose
A	like at least it's just Aldi that's just there
B	um we don't have a big Waitrose around here though
A	there's that one at the Grafton though
B	that's tiny
A	I dunno
B	Don't know how many they have in in the north-east
A	now there's a value judgement
B	a couple
A	uh-huh
B	you've got sort of er um
B	well Morrisons is  Morrisons is  nice isn't it yeah
A	right
B	and Booths
A	in Lancaster
B	Cos it's not a yeah they they probably have some
A	no you've offended us
B	more some different er
A	get my high quality shopping from Morrisons
B	er I like Morrisons
B	it's one of my favourite er
A	oh yeah yeah
B	one is in er Morrisons
A	I do like it
B	market
A	there used to be Prestos and um my nana used to work in Prestos
B	er on the tills?
A	on the tills
B	oh you mean the cashier
A	yeah
B	or whatever they're called er
A	yeah
B	had to um had to type in the numbers
A	yeah
B	er every time
A	yeah
B	so they didn't scan
A	but I think actually when if I if I'm not mistaken when Aldi and that got going over here I think they didn't you had to know all the prices of the things in the shop if you worked there
B	um but yeah that he's he's got deadly er well
A	oh well then check it then
B	to verify that
A	I bet he did
B	Cos
A	honestly I'm sure he did
B	what am I searching for? Er
A	Lloyd Grossman then maybe er
B	sauce fatalities
A	just see what comes up
B	sauce death
A	Don't type in Lloyd Grossman sauce death
B	sauce death
A	yeah

B	that's Blair's Ultra Death Sauce
A	type it in the news like
B	I'll put
A	go on Google News and then
B	I could put Lloyd Grossman
A	type it in Google News
A	maybe I dreamed it
B	um
A	that'll be a really stupid dream if I just had dream that
B	better than some dreams
A	pasta sauce
B	yeah that I was blind
A	that is not a very nice dream
B	Lloyd Grossman er sauce poisoning
A	no just type in Lloyd
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	sauce poisoning
B	er
A	what was that thing that he was on? Through the Keyhole? And he'd be like
B	he was he
A	David it's over to you

A	and where is he from? With that voice?
B	er I think it's um
A	he's from everywhere
B	new
B	oh yeah he's doing like because he's doing his German accent his French accent and his does a lot of different accents doesn't he so
A	and just like that one for Jesus
B	er

B	Jesus God is James Mason
A	that's right
B	um
A	I haven't watched that for ages
B	er
A	got smartphone
B	sorry just checking this
A	ignoration problems
B	um
A	oh it can't be true
B	Cos it's like if you  if you  keep looking down there maybe something more
A	oh no
B	um
A	oh here we are
B	the FSA? That's the
A	the Food Standards Agency
B	oh right
A	Grossman sauces
B	botulism
A	I don't know
A	sort of a quote's that?
B	it's great isn't he
A	it could have been anybody
B	that guy  didn't want to be named did he
A	I didn't want to commit to that tell very telling statement
B	obviously yeah
A	that's funny
B	you had the no that's an interesting little bit of fact
A	I also heard that about like
B	like in the jars like people always
A	when was it?
B	going round
A	oh it was the pickle the pickles man
B	er pickles man?
A	was it Germany? There was a a recently like there was that outbreak of some other sort of like
B	oh was this is this the serial killer or something? That goes round putting poison in pickles? Pickle poisoner
A	mm er maybe
B	oh
A	or may not be
B	no no I'm just basing it on this food poisoning case
A	no it was um the beansprouts thing
B	oh yeah well there was that case
A	they said it was like
B	of um
A	they said it was it a German
B	er that disease which was um what was the disease? Er it was
A	I can't remember
B	there was a few cases in Germany and it
A	that's right
B	the the Germans blamed
A	yeah
B	the German media blamed Spain
A	spanish
B	costing the
A	that's right
B	costing the  Spanish economy
A	that's right yeah
B	huge amounts of money
A	well like no one wanted to but Spanish cucumbers or something
B	then like Spanish cucumber
A	stupid isn't it
B	but actually I think it came from Egypt or something in the end when it was er
A	beansprouts?
B	um but disease
A	I can't remember what it was
B	I can't remember what the disease
B	there's
A	yeah but if if you always thought about that though you would never
B	intentional poisoning or er ill yeah but
A	but you would never eat anything
B	intentional or accidental poisoning
A	if you're worried about that all the time
B	there's precautions cos like what they said with these cases of er whatever the virus was er
A	yeah
B	that that
A	the cucumber one
A	yeah
B	like raw if
A	if you haven't cooked them
B	you're eating raw fresh things then I suppose if you wash them first you're better off
A	well you don't know what's happened
B	it's er
A	but I don't think it put me off Spain
B	well no it wouldn't put you off Spain cos it wasn't Spain that er
A	no that's true actually
B	that did it in the first place
B	it was er it was Egypt
A	was it Egypt?
B	I think or it
A	oh right
B	beansprouts was like left like you know don't maybe stopped off or or like perhaps it got
A	but that's the thing like
A	that's the thing with these like diseases like that
B	um
A	you know you
B	yeah like this
A	you you carry you it you one person but then you get on a aeroplane with three hundred people now they've all
B	well there's
A	and pass it on and
B	it was a bit  a bit
A	yeah
B	er that was maybe
A	my mum had it I think
B	there was a lot of stuff going on about I think it was when actually we we moved into our Regent Street flat
A	yeah
B	Cos
A	I'm sure my mum had swine flu
B	it was er
A	yeah
B	but think of the reverse
A	yeah
B	basically this flu as far as I understand it was just normal
A	normal flu
B	it was just a kind of flu
A	yeah
B	but you have to always brand it as as
A	but how would you know?
B	a particularly horrible one
A	how would you know if you have normal flu or swine flu?
B	er I don't know if you  if you
A	do you have to get tested?
B	could know yourself
A	but I don't think they tested everyone
B	I don't know if the symptoms really matter
A	yeah
B	it's the youngest and oldest that that er
A	that's true
B	tend to be er at risk
A	and people who are already poorly
B	with flu
A	I tell you another I
B	oh
A	that's weird isn't it
B	well I guess you just have to I mean
A	no I think well it wasn't I mean I'm not that old
B	yeah
A	am I
B	oh yeah no I didn't mean like
A	twenty years ago or something
B	no I didn't mean like er polio or something
A	yeah I don't know
B	prone to it or something
A	yeah maybe
B	um
A	it's supposed to be really bad if you get it when you're old
B	yeah
A	them sort of things
B	er that was er what was that did you say it was
A	chickenpox I think
B	chickenpox
A	I think they've got rid of smallpox
B	now that's actually gone
A	although they probably still do it in labs like squirted in rats' eyes and all that
B	er well yeah cos that's cos it was a  it was a  sort of a cow
A	er someone must've given it to her
B	wasn't it connected with it was connected with cows wasn't it or
A	I dunno
B	there's cowpox I mean I don't know
A	was it?
B	well there's there was cowpox and that's how they did all the
A	oh
B	they knew that like like the milk um tut what do they call them? Milk milkmaids? That
A	milkmaids
B	milkers
A	oh that sounds familiar
B	milkmen and milkmaids get
A	the milk er the milk people
B	they they were getting cowpox off the er
A	the dairy
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cow employees
B	move milk transport managers
B	or something
B	yeah so executive er
B	milking
A	dairy
B	operators or something
A	facilitators
B	they er
B	they were getting cowpox off the cows' udders but
A	urgh
B	that that was I think actually protecting them against er smallpox I think although although you've gotta watch that
A	there's a few ones isn't there like um
B	because and it no of course that was the birth of vaccination and stuff
A	like sickle-cell anaemia and malaria
B	yeah that's one of them things where I'm
A	yeah you're knackered
B	nasty disease
A	yeah
B	whereas the vaccination one was that it er because the you know you've been exposed to that other one which is not life-threatening
A	yeah
A	I'm not sure
B	er but yeah so um that was the sort of the birth of
A	yeah
B	the
A	oh I still remember getting my TB like
B	oh yeah
A	when I was like a trainee nurse
B	oh yeah no yeah yeah you have um
A	I don't I
B	no it's last year I I was really scared of injections
A	tB?
B	tB it's you're you're only
A	no you have them when you're little don't you
B	sort of thirteen years old though
A	you mean when you
B	oh the first one that I can really consciously
A	yeah
B	clearly remember having I I don't remember having really like much of a
A	I remember having like polio at junior school or something
B	I don't think I had an injection in junior school
A	or was that a drop? Like do they give you it in your mouth
B	yeah isn't that sort of a sugar there's a sugary thing
A	well they'll not give it to you in in sugar anymore
B	you have like a sugar lump with a
A	there'll not be that little girl and a
B	I I had a sugar lump or something
A	yeah not anymore though
B	square of tofu?
A	they're not gonna give kids like a big lump of sugar
B	might do
A	er Jamie Oliver'll have something to say about that
B	well yeah I mean um
A	on like a  on like a  beansprout or something
B	well the the they'll er
A	A carrot
B	yes they'll actually be getting like
A	A carrot stick
B	a virus on the  on the
A	dipped in polio
B	but er
A	that's stupid
B	er
B	like salmonella
A	with a lovely polio dressing on the side
B	yeah
A	interesting
B	er
A	stupid
A	I don't mind injections though
B	there's a lot of er
A	I don't love them but
B	you you've got um some some some people in your family I believe are have er er major sort of medical stories er
A	oh I'm not gonna get
B	have a fondness for
A	old nana
B	er like fondness for you know for gory details about er
A	well that's what I was saying like there were like when you know obviously
B	well did you  did you  see the moment when she found out?
A	no they were on the phone but I could just
B	yeah
A	I was using some artistic license there but like literally you know I can see her in her face it's just like she wants to like
A	tell all of these
B	yeah
A	like horrific medical blunders like
B	um
A	she's been awful like
B	they they like she she can be cos it's easy to get scared isn't it if you have a if you have some symptoms and you know and you go on the internet and
A	well yeah
B	or or you talk to  you talk to  someone like your er nana
A	yeah
B	and you know they might say oh you've got a oh is that a rash? Well it could be you know it it probably isn't
A	is it the plague? It might be
B	it it is probably isn't you know like
B	meningitis
A	oh
B	round round our street or something and had a rash on on his finger and and and it
A	but to be fair though she has had her fair share of like medical emergencies
B	yeah but if your brother um
A	and my grandad had that
B	yeah
A	anaphylaxia thing and
A	but part of her secretly delights in it like the the the drama of it
B	well I think she she would have made a good nurse wouldn't she
A	I don't know
B	um
A	like
B	er
A	she wouldn't get anything done
B	I mean because I
A	she'd just be chattering on telling you about
B	think I prefer a noisy nurse to like like a sort of er eerie nurse that like
A	I don't know
B	that you don't know when they like they come in
A	yeah
B	and you don't know they're there cos they're so quiet like
A	I dunno
B	no  no I  I haven't um er been in in hospital
A	since the I had my grommets
B	no I can't remember really being er ever actually
A	no
B	er
A	on my adenoids
B	um
A	yeah
B	um
A	they're horrible aren't they
B	er they're they can be a bit sort of er like I think the um
A	and I think when you go and see old people who are in hospital
A	it's just er a bit like when they're in  when they're in  like a ward with floods of like crazy other old people and that
A	it's a bit much
B	yeah I think er er I it it'd be hard to have to stay overnight and stuff
A	yeah
B	I suppose it's better if you  if you  have your own
A	little room
B	room or or something or er get
A	private healthcare
B	like you get your your
A	but that thing about the TV that's just
B	your family to live in
A	yeah
B	it's better
A	I dunno if you can though
B	I dunno
A	but that thing about like the TV
B	oh yeah the TV thing
A	that's so bad
B	I hope that
A	I still can't get over that like
B	well I think it's the price of it actually rather than the the act of paying that's
A	it's the what sorry?
B	the price
A	yeah but even if it was a pound a day I would still be like I think that would still be wrong
B	I mean well yeah er er it would be better to have um
A	Cos if you've paid for your TV licence like
B	yeah like a  like a free yeah you should get maybe a
A	Cos if you
B	yeah
A	if you're like a little old lady and you've paid
B	yeah
A	you've paid for your TV licence
B	all your life yeah
A	but you can't watch it in your house because you're in hospital like
B	I mean er I I think that they should definitely give you some free channels for the  for the  yeah the  in the  in hospital
A	yeah
B	er thing
A	well maybe
B	the way it works is obviously it's er outsourced to some companies
A	yeah
B	I mean there's just
A	but I think it just it's prejudice against the old people though
B	it's it's you're putting it's not a  it's not a  competitive market at the moment at all cos you're just outsourcing the the beds
A	yeah
B	er to one you know one hospital will outsource to one company therefore that's no competition there at all
A	but I think like it's just penalizing old people
B	yeah younger people as well wouldn't be so yeah
A	you'd take your smartphone
B	well I mean well they they did they were trying to stop that as well because you see the company has an incentive that it wants its own
A	yeah
B	phone service and its own internet
A	but surely it can't
B	service to be used
A	I don't think you can though can you?
B	I I think the way it's worked is that that people do want
B	to have a screen
A	yeah it's stupid
B	a company requiring a certain amount of profit for every hospital for those screens
A	yeah
B	channels to er the mainly older people in the beds
A	poorer people
B	and er I I think um
A	no it's pretty shocking
B	you know you'd obviously if you've got to pay for the service if you've got to pay for the the
A	yep
B	screens but um
A	I wonder what we'll be like when we're old people
B	oh yeah well I mean
A	Cos I remember
B	that you share
A	that was in like a big wooden box
B	yeah well
A	do you remember those?
B	well I've seen
A	well I was cutting edge me
B	a big one as  that
A	yeah
B	I think
A	like djoo like
B	yeah so you actually had to find its position on the dial
A	yeah
B	er
A	but there was never a remote or anything
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	but now they have all them
B	now we've got digital so er you it sort of does itself
A	but I don't understand like so like that TV like it's still a big like square box TV but why would you just throw it out just to get a flat one? It just seems stupid
B	er
A	if that exploded I wouldn't buy necessarily another big square TV like that
B	yeah
A	but I'm not gonna throw that out to buy a flat one
B	no well I mean I think some people just like to have the latest technology don't they
A	but there's nothing wrong with that TV
B	I know
A	well actually
B	I think the majority of people would er it's alright actually er
A	it does make like a brr sound if the volume's up too high
B	I'm not sure that's it or one of the other machines actually
A	do you think it's the digibox?
B	I don't think it's the
A	yeah till I snapped it
B	till you broke the wire
A	yeah
B	of that er
A	oh well
B	but we um
A	I bet that's only like 1p that wire though
B	yeah but I think most people would not throw something away unless it it was broken
A	yeah
B	well you normally  you normally  get a new flash TV you know a a a
A	do you remember that pub?
B	spectacular sort of massive flatscreen TV with a you know like a
A	yeah
B	as big as a sofa size TV
A	yeah
B	and then
A	I think
B	and then you'd but you'd keep the other one the the fat old one as well
A	yeah
B	put that in like the baby's room or something
A	the bedroom
B	and the baby can have its own
B	remote control and stuff
B	er oh yeah yeah yeah
A	you have one in like every corner
B	er I think your er I think your mum had er something like that
B	in er
A	I can't remember
B	I think there was like a
A	oh yeah
B	or so
A	when we were at the house
B	there were six or so speakers lined up
A	yeah
B	who's that?
B	oh um tut er
A	yeah
B	I definitely believe that er he's got
A	I'm sure he had got like a special
B	he brought  he brought  something
A	special
B	quite
A	speakery thing
B	yeah and he had it in his er bedroom or something but he er
A	that's right
B	he also had well he has a
A	yeah
B	the other one  the other one
A	iPhone
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	he's their big  their big  present that he'd got was er their big tech present was the er it was um
A	iPad
B	it was a
A	oh yeah
B	it was that that
A	fancy camera
B	camera that takes loads of photos
A	oh yeah
B	gives you the best
A	yeah that's right
B	five after you've clicked
A	yeah
B	and then find the best er
A	yeah
B	you know the best
A	Cos I saw that on
B	best one and it'll give you  give you  a choice of the the best ones yeah
A	Cos they do that on like wildlife photography don't they because like you know I saw it on
B	yeah
A	was it Frozen Planet?
B	yeah
A	what was the other one called?
B	to make sure that you've captured like cos yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah to
A	yeah
B	per second
A	but I think that on on
B	to choose from
A	on Frozen Planet it was because like say if they were waiting for like a um tut a whale to like burst through the surface
B	yeah you
A	like you
B	you can't guarantee that it clicks on time
A	by the time you've pressed it it like it it's already happened hasn't it
B	er yeah yeah well it's
A	yeah
B	at twenty-five frames per second
A	yeah
B	but then it it simply takes a
A	yeah
B	one second or two seconds out of that film
A	yeah
B	and uses that
A	for the picture
B	then restarts and and begins filming again
A	yeah
B	and then you can choose the best out of that
A	yeah
B	or something
A	I wonder how it judges which one's the best like
B	mm
A	Cos I don't think it shows you every one does it
B	er
A	especially if you were taking something that wasn't moving
B	well it it has some automatic  it has some automatic  features
A	yeah if your eyes were closed
B	it'd be able to sort of
A	oh I hate the pictures when like
B	exclude them yeah
A	you look really drunk cos your eyes are like half closed
A	I'm glad if something can get rid of those
B	well yeah
A	I hate that kind of thing
B	er you do
A	yeah
B	er software would be able to do that
A	yeah
B	you don't get the
A	I don't think so
A	yeah
B	twenty-five frames a second
A	that face recognition stuff
B	yeah I've been I know airports yeah
B	you're back back onto er privacy here yeah
A	um
B	when when you say that what do you mean track people's behaviour or?
A	so if we go airport we might
B	Cos that could mean  that could mean  like they know whether you've tied your shoelaces or
A	but tying your shoelaces
B	yeah
A	probably like so so say normally when you go through security you you would go and check see where your flight is
B	yeah there's sort of a like
A	called yet
B	there's a bit of a
A	then you might go to Boots
B	procedure that you follow isn't there
A	and get some a glass of water just to drink and
B	yeah so do do they mean that they're they're not perhaps necessarily targeting individuals
A	yeah
B	to see what people do
A	but then  but then by  by modelling what people do so go to Boots then go and look in
B	yeah sit in a cafe
A	try some sunglasses on
B	for five hours
A	go and have three pints of beer even though it's one in the morning
B	that's one of the good things about er
A	I know that's one of the good things like about airports
B	about airports is that  is that  you can sort of break rules that normally you
A	yeah
B	so
A	rules don't apply
B	er
A	what do
B	the crowd is doing? Because
A	yeah
B	but then I suppose obviously there's always like statistically a a sort of a long tail so to speak the the
A	well yeah
B	er the weird  the weird  um
A	yeah but I don't think it's
B	people who yeah
A	I don't think it's decisive
B	I I think there's certain things
A	but I think it would flag them
B	well they'll then start they'd start spying on on the weirdly
A	mm
B	behaviour people wouldn't they
A	oh I love those
B	don't you like UK Border Force or something that get on
A	in fact let's put some on
B	pick Pick TV
A	oh can't put um er Really
B	like er on um yeah Really
A	and er what's the er Australian one?
B	there's something you see if you see footage of people who are doing something dodgy like generally I mean say they're smuggling I think there's a tendency to be er
A	A bit tense
B	er
B	I think there's also like if you are if I was smuggling something I think I would wanna act normal
A	yeah
B	you know what I mean? But
A	but
B	you can't
A	no
B	always really act normal
A	I don't know
B	two kilograms of coke in their
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	really tense
B	yeah I think you would
A	tense pretending to be calm er looks different
B	yeah I mean but this is you'd probably be going on like
A	like you know when you're
B	really spying and like really like body language sort of thing
A	yeah but I think that's what  that's what  it was
B	is that what you meant?
A	yeah
B	not actual
A	I think so
B	like what
A	but I think so
B	can give away
A	I mean they've got so many cameras
B	what from a for what subject?
A	um
B	the the sort of body language recognition or something?
A	yeah like
B	yeah
A	mm
