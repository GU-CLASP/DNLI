A	there we go okay?
B	alright
A	so er now it's on
B	okay
A	we are on
B	so let's just pretend okay
A	yes
B	the
A	so we're starting with three shapes which represent
B	the three three core competences of the business
A	yes
B	okay? not in any particularly
A	right
B	this represents technology
A	yes
B	social media technologies
A	right so this is er about communication
B	yeah
A	yes?
B	so it's about using technology to good effect
A	yes
B	off the back of that
A	making the most of being able to spread the word
B	yeah
A	yes
B	exactly erm off the back of that because I've already made a start and there's other people who I can draw in erm to come into the academic world so this represents a an academic world and academic world is important because if you really got the end game being on the erm the er publishing companies erm most of the way I think you actually get to do this sort of work is when you've been hanging around here and getting to know people in the right places
A	er publishing in academia?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah okay yeah
B	study skills that's what I'm
A	yes
B	well known for
A	right
B	so
A	right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	okay?
A	yes
B	there's a lot more that can be done in this area and I known that cos I've been working in this study skills learning skills area for three and a half years
A	right yeah
B	okay so I know that business quite well
A	yes
B	so this is
A	yes
B	and this how we get the students to tell us what they want
A	yes
B	we get we get that information and we kind of cherry-pick the bits that we think are useful for us and
A	yeah
B	in terms of moving into the academic realm and hobnobbing with the right people that means going to conferences and shit
A	yeah
B	and then when erm you rub up again with erm academics who know people who are already in with the with the publishing companies erm you make the sort of erm you know business step into you know a fully and what I would call a digital a digitalised you know
A	yes
B	so I can see that I can teach people language but I can also teach people how to argue
A	mm
B	more effectively
A	yeah
B	in academic world
A	okay
B	and we could even go to
A	yes okay so
B	mm
A	er and other institutions or or university university?
B	we'll keep it to universities for now
A	so you'd start there
B	mm
A	so it's kind of like how Facebook started
B	mm
A	that started at college basically
B	mm okay
A	and and everybody so that they tested an idea within one crowd and and within moments it had spread to all these other unis that wanted the same system
B	okay well
A	so if you're if you say that
B	in social yeah
A	you've got people who er you would choose to interview
B	okay wait so social media
A	mm
B	he does respond but he's basically the person delivering the message yeah?
A	yeah
B	I I don't see any other people around right now what I like about the interview technique is that it puts people normally if you're really good at it it puts people on an equal level of contribution
A	mm
B	and erm what you'd call collaboration knowledge co-construction of knowledge right?
A	yeah
B	so yes I do want students to deliver me messages more importantly I want them to come to that site and
A	yeah
B	okay? so I don't know how all the IPR stuff works I have no idea but yes essentially I'm creating a platform where people can come deliver their message to me
A	can I just be clear about what message are people trying to
B	right so in this book in this article
A	yeah
B	it talks about and you need to read it but it talks about student engagement and disengagement so I deliver a message at the beginning of my website which explains the mission of the website the mission of the website is to get students to deliver messages or ideas on how to engage at university and to stop disengagement from occurring at university cos at the moment we're experiencing high levels of attrition in the first year
A	so
B	no no it's not cos there's gonna be a dogma yeah? the dogma's gonna say
A	you mean persons?
B	yeah you're allowed to talk about the success
A	right okay
B	yeah?
A	yeah and that okay and that's fine
B	well also success breeds success so if you see that erm Perth a Western Australia university is doing a student erm film festival and then the other students see that over on the other side er east side of of the coast and go well why don't we do that?
A	mm
B	we should go and ask the people who were meant to be engaging us to allow us to do shit like this and give us money so that we can run our own student film festival
A	mm uh-mm mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	okay
A	and have you got a picture in your mind of when you would like to make that happen?
B	yeah I want this to happen in I want it to go live in
A	well frankly you're dreaming
B	erm
A	I'm not saying I want you
B	some videos a few videos
A	right so
B	what size are you thinking of?
A	well
B	mm
A	and what you want is an audience to turn up on day one
B	I know that's why it's
A	yeah?
B	semester one
A	that's this year
B	yeah week one semester
A	well if you consider the amount of work that actually needs to be done in the context of what else you've got to to do
B	well yeah but let's just say that we can get some hands on you know resources of people backing us to get that bit going
A	erm
B	I thought we were gonna outsource some of this
A	yeah just hear me out right?
B	mm okay
A	going away in June
B	mm
A	yeah? come back midst June
B	mm
A	you're talking about the six five to six week period er it's a six week period to get to there
B	mm
A	right? so in that six weeks you've still got to deliver certain things
B	mm
A	and
B	no
A	right?
B	I didn't say ten er you said ten I never said ten
A	er okay so when you start erm what kind of frequency do you want to publish information on
B	I dunno well you tell me what do you think's beneficial?
A	well
B	okay
A	and erm
B	mm
A	or they have that particular focus so if you start somewhere start with one per week
B	mm
A	and er and you need to maintain a connection with your audience right?
B	mm
A	so you you get your your pre-message out there you create a launch platform
B	mm
A	you have a a a landing page for a website
B	mm
A	which people you get people to sign up to that to start with
B	mm
A	before you get to the video stage
B	mm
A	right? and you might try and erm promote that there's there's a product that they might be interested in yeah? so they get access to that by signing up
B	mm
A	yeah? erm and you can and you and you wanna try and create some kind of message that goes through your Facebook er and Twitter et cetera so the it can get shared
B	mm
A	amongst the social stuff
B	mm
A	so you have to get all those things in place upfront and then you want erm a a a series of videos that you've got pre-prepared that you can launch to take the pressure off having to create those at those times
B	mm
A	so you launch one you're going to be dealing with trying to capture that market and capture the people
B	mm
A	and that's where your time's gonna be spent rather than making videos
B	mm
A	so if you've got a few made in advance you've bought yourself time to get used to that process
B	mm
A	and then
B	mm
A	so you might say oh well I've got a couple of weeks left I need to start creating some more videos so then I've got a buffer
B	mm
A	of more right? erm and you'll find that information will come in that you'll want to try and adapt with
B	mm
A	to try and help streamline a few things and what have you all sorts of systems you need to make sure are set up
B	yeah you say you
A	and so on
B	meaning I er is that meaning like you?
A	well that's us yeah?
B	oh oh okay
A	that's us
B	yeah
A	erm er and and sure outsourcing and getting people onboard erm some of the stuff I have an awareness of but I've never done
B	mm
A	so I need in that June period I would be looking to be using something to to to learn and create and I'd prefer to know how to do that first before I do it in real for this
B	yeah
A	right? so erm part of it is what I I would have put that kind of platform together with
B	mm
A	but they weren't receptive to that but I have a quite a big big picture of
B	mm
A	it's quite a large platform of
B	mm
A	how you bash it out yeah?
B	mm
A	and and you're
B	mm
A	and getting people's email addresses so you're getting messages out to them as soon as you've got that you can create email campaigns
B	mm
A	to keep people onboard they're quite that is quite straightforward
B	yeah
A	you keep them engaged that way
B	yeah
A	and you can do that on a on a however many day basis
B	yeah
A	but it's really you bash out a message side of A4 boom
B	yeah
A	out there
B	okay
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	and that gets them interested and connected upfront and you can use other carrots to get them involved like free products et cetera and then you go boom on that day this is what's gonna happen come and have a look at us you might flash out some kind of certainly a social media message if not a media message you try and get something published in er connecting forums or pages or media
B	yeah
A	that leads to your site
B	yeah
A	so you say you go to Education Supplement dot com or whatever it is you write a little article you get them to publish it you put stuff into their forums
B	mm
A	and you say this is who I am come and have a look at my stuff boom you're getting people from all these different corners who go boom land on your on your site at the same time
B	yeah
A	yeah? so erm and you you kind of want to you know there are technical things you need to be aware of that
B	yeah that's kind of cool though
A	and that's kind of cool but it fucks up your launch and that
B	sure
A	so you wanna you wanna get through that and keep that going so there's a
B	yeah this is the test
A	you want you want to you want to take some guinea pigs
B	yeah
A	and you wanna have them be the guinea pig run
B	yeah
A	for it first
B	okay this is the test
A	so
B	oh I will
A	yeah
B	yeah thanks and er the test is semester two two thousand and thirteen the real launch will be semester one two thousand and fourteen because the semester one launch is fucking massive
A	right okay
B	it's huge orientation is when students are switched on they're at their most engaged and that's when we know we've got a captive audience
A	mm
B	I know it
A	mm
B	okay I've seen it been there and I've seen five hundred people in a lecture theatre
A	okay so this test that you do here
B	yeah
A	what are you gonna do with the other six or eight months
B	well interview people grow a repository
A	right erm and if you are one of those people somebody came along and said do you mind if I interview you blah-blah-blah-blah-blah erm we wanna use this we're gonna use it on this basis oh but we're not gonna use it for six months
B	no no we'll would we'll we'll figure out a frequency that will be enough to keep it ticking along
A	mm
B	but you can have a
A	plan
B	you can have a mini launch
A	yeah
B	and you can have a major launch
A	yeah yeah you're right erm
B	so the ones who are the early adopters are all cool with it
A	yeah yeah for sure and you've got the early adopters who who who who are by
B	are spreading the word for us
A	who are by definition people outside the normal box of
B	yeah
A	the bell curve anyway
B	yeah
A	so erm
B	yeah
A	erm product
B	yeah
A	yeah? and
B	and the universities will never compete on that level as quickly as we can move because marketing is so full of bureaucracy that no one will be able to make decisions on anything
B	well they can't
A	no I'm talking about other individuals
B	oh yes of course
A	you know?
B	they can always do it yeah
A	yeah? anywhere yeah?
B	so could
A	so if you're looking at trying to get
B	I think you're right and a a product or a service attached to the interviews would be useful
A	yeah and you and you build a series of those things as you go
B	yeah
A	so you can say in that six months that allows you to build one side of it and the other
B	yeah
A	the interview side of it and the core business side
B	mm
A	yeah? and you're linking those things together you're getting messages out there et cetera
B	well
A	yeah
B	this is just a platform to get credibility in order to move into these areas
A	well you still want to find mechanisms to get your money in the door
B	yes well the mechanism
unknown_female	Arnold come here
B	I don't even know how
unknown_female	Arnold
A	hey fella
B	oh
A	you know
unknown_female	sorry
B	oi that's alright
A	that's alright
B	erm yeah
A	he's not allowed our beer or our crisps
B	but
A	cheers mate
unknown_female	that's alright
A	have a nice day
unknown_female	yeah alright
B	potentially sponsors
A	well yeah yeah well
B	but we need to
A	well look look in in terms of of websites right
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so like what that other guy was doing he was hanging different products off his site
B	mm
A	but it's such that if somebody clicks through your site to go and purchase that product he would have got a commission from the software company
B	mm
A	so it's a kickback yeah for sending people in in in their direction
B	mm
A	so what you would do
A	is you would identify key parts that er
B	mm
A	and what you're trying to do is you're getting exposure because you are actually
B	right
A	yeah?
B	okay I I'll need to
A	well I know how to do in an internet marketing way
B	okay
A	yeah
B	but we can also get some free
A	mm
B	how to do it cos I think he does that day in day out so it would be good to touch base with him and
A	yeah for sure
B	yeah
A	and I think getting a a sound erm independent outlook
B	yeah
A	is good
B	get some measurements in thrown in there cos that's what companies want to see
A	yeah
B	how do you measure this?
A	mm
B	that's what you don't know but
A	yeah yeah yeah exactly
B	okay so let's have him
A	and then
B	more as a sort of you know cursory kind of advisor
A	mm and we want to be able to capture some metrics as we go
B	yeah absolutely
A	yeah?
B	so I have got a couple of ideas of how to do that erm
A	or a portal
B	a portal yeah I'm thinking port meaning something like you know
A	you're saying well you pitch this to an international student saying you're arriving from outside of this place
B	so one of my dogma questions in the interview is
A	mm
B	and she gets hey Montreal is like blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
A	mm mm
B	and oh Sydney's fantastic because blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
A	mm and so people
B	and if you go to
A	get this international feel for it
B	so
A	mm
B	that's what kids get on these days buy er plane tickets and they go somewhere
A	mm mm yeah
B	so I'm thinking airline carrier
A	oh as an affiliate?
B	mm
A	well could be
B	well I mean it would only happen if it was a majorly successful site
A	yeah
B	it's may as well aim big there
A	well you wanna be aiming high
B	I'm aiming very high
A	mm
B	I'm thinking New
A	Virgin
B	who? Virgin yeah alright
A	er if wanna kind of think flamboyant and think entrepreneurial and think the kind of people who like the spirit of entrepreneurs Virgin's a good outfit to run
B	mm
A	if you get somebody like Branson saying hello
B	yeah
A	you just have to get him to say hello
B	mm
A	because he would like the idea that you're sending business his way er
B	does he?
A	yeah he doesn't believe in the
B	but this is about students telling us
A	mm
B	what they want he likes that he likes having
A	mm
B	customers telling you
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	what you want
A	yeah yeah
B	what they want
A	yeah no I'm I'm let's not suppose that one but yeah that in the rounds that sounds quite strategically interesting
B	I think it should be thematic as well
A	through their
B	I I actually do think month in month out you should we should be picking themes
A	yeah mm
B	and then another theme might be you know tell us about something cool that your lecturer did the other day you know or tell us about some educational technology that you didn't know about and how you you know so the themes are always about engagement but I know
A	yeah okay erm
B	I want a box where people can write in to me and suggest themes like so frank so people write in say you know
A	well that's what you use your test crowd for upfront
B	mm
A	you'll ask them their opinions you'll get their feeling you see what they like and try them on products and see
B	don't want too much cos students have got a completely minimal attention span
A	yeah well you're probably trying to draw in those who will react like that say if it's strength on
B	yeah I don't want it too hard
A	yeah well that that's what you're trying to to test
B	yeah
A	you're trying to test whether your your ideas are are
B	yeah
A	as as much as you think you know you will find surprises
B	well I know a
A	yeah and and I mean just what I you know I obviously said that to
B	mm
A	before you do the major launch and that's what I'm saying with the six month period you look to try and optimise that so when you do go bang you go bang with a big bang
B	yeah alright
A	and
A	got some some money
B	that dog's making a freeking beeline for us again
A	he is
B	get your hand out
A	yes
B	he's coming straight at you
A	yeah he's gonna he's gonna hey dog
A	something about cricket you like isn't it? yeah?
unknown_female	sorry guys he can smell the chips a mile off
A	bribery
unknown_female	he loves potato chips
B	oh right
A	here we go
unknown_female	go on move it
B	that's pretty funny
unknown_female	go on move it
B	now there isn't gonna be just me by the way interviewing students I'm going to do erm er I'm gonna close the learning loop okay so
A	mm
B	yeah double act always works perfectly
A	yes
B	erm who actually is a lecturer and lends credibility to the whole thing okay?
A	right okay
B	so I'm a learning advisor and we need a lecturer
A	academic lecturer somebody who's
B	academic lecturer it's somebody who's really working in the environment and knows what you know students are up against
A	mm
B	but can also give a little bit of themselves and say you know yeah but I'm
A	mm
B	so mainly to do with universities but you don't slag off the universities you just let so this person is going to be called is going to be faceless is not gonna have a face I'm gonna be the face yeah?
A	right
B	not two two competing faces but he's gonna have a voice and he's gonna be a podcast voice okay?
A	oh so he's gonna be like the stick?
A	Spod
B	Sage
A	Sage
B	Sage on a stage
A	right okay
B	wise one whatever
A	yeah okay
B	and Sage is gonna be the word of reason and reflection
A	the footage
B	he will listen
A	mm
B	will make some notes and then he will record his erm
A	response to that
B	response to that
A	and what do you do with that response?
B	and then I post it up so that's another little side bit so interview and then maybe a day or two later I don't know how the trickledown effect will happen
A	mm mm
B	but you've always got a follow up
A	yeah okay
B	you've got another reason for going back and having a and and listening
A	yeah yeah I I I I like that
B	you've got that
A	you can say
B	yeah
A	like in a couple of days it
B	exactly
A	it being there
B	it's just
A	but within a week
B	yeah
A	you say at some time during that week it becomes quite random
B	mm
A	that you you
B	yeah
A	and when you post it that that is done through an email and distribution as well as it going up on that website
B	yeah
A	so people go well this week we had this you've got the link to the web
B	yeah
A	the the video so people can come and watch the video
B	yeah
A	and then you've also got the link that goes to the response
B	yeah
A	to that
B	yeah
A	yeah? so then you've got a story to tell we had an interview with X Y Z
B	yeah
A	these were the points
B	yeah
A	and then this is the feedback or that this is some reflection from guest lecturer blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
B	yeah
A	that that that
B	I mean don't tell them too much cos you really do want to
A	the Sage from the the Sage
B	yeah you just give them a log line of about three words and then they've got to go and listen to the podcast on the website
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah but what it however it's formatted
B	mm
A	and how whatever it looks like but you can I can get the gist
B	okay
A	that's quite cool
B	so the thing
A	mm
B	about it is then is that
A	what's in it for the lecturer?
B	oh well we'll come to that in a minute erm Sage
A	mm
B	so Sage has to have a narrative working around him
A	yes
B	okay otherwise he's just gonna be fucking boring
A	well you can make it sound like a podcast
B	yeah well it will be a podcast but what I'm trying to say is I'm creating a persona for Sage here
A	yes yeah that's right
B	cos he hasn't got a face he's like an avatar in a way
A	mm
B	but not cos I don't hate avatars okay
A	yeah
B	so he won't have a cartoon face he will not have a face he will just have a voice okay? so that's something that students are gonna feel a bit wary about but what are we gonna tell them about Sage? hang on let me have a go cos I'm I haven't had a chance
A	I haven't said anything
B	well you were about to Sage is gonna have two things going for him okay? to appeal to the male student audience he's gonna love test-driving cars
A	yeah okay cool
B	yeah?
A	yeah yeah alright
B	so the reason why I want that to happen is because I want students to engage with the personalities that I've presented to them
A	well Sage could be Richard Hammond
B	yeah
A	cos he loves science and education
B	Sage could be anyone it's just a voice but Sage actually has to be quite clever
A	mm
B	he can't be somebody who's a bit of a nonce
A	yeah okay mm
B	so he's got to be an inside job
A	yeah
B	but he can't be too inside on the outside
A	mm
B	cos people start getting a bit wary about it
A	mm
B	even though I clearly work from
A	people don't need to know that
B	ah well this is then this is gonna be the interesting thing isn't it? credibility
A	at a university
B	no but think about it you your English fella
A	mm mm mm
B	well what did he get out of that? well what did they get out of that? so that somebody wants to go to
A	maybe
B	and that's just the beginning
A	yeah I know
B	mm
A	so
B	does that frighten you?
A	oh I
B	well we
A	yeah I know I know I know I know I know know know
B	yeah
A	okay
B	it also means I maximise my erm time at
A	yes erm
B	like?
A	well it's like when you're trying to say to somebody you want to steer them to a certain place that they want to see that others have already been there
B	that's how no I've got really good
A	that kind of thing
B	student contacts
A	mm
B	trust me
A	mm
B	we've got people who I know would turn up tomorrow and do an interview with me and they'll be fascinating
A	yeah yeah I'm not I'm not worried about that
B	well that's the content that's the bit I do
B	mini launch
A	mini
B	yeah
A	launch yeah and so this mean you you you're actually trying to constrain anything or are you
B	no
A	no? you're just doing a mini launch and see where it goes?
B	yeah
A	right so you take that where where where does it go and before you launch you wanna have already engagement with things like your social sites yeah?
B	yeah
A	on a small level but so at least at least that it looks like it's being used
B	of course
A	it's not brand new
B	yeah
A	yeah? so erm
B	so we need er seeders
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and you need outsourcers
A	mm mm
B	that's where you come in
A	yeah
B	I'll I'll do everything I can in the hours that I've got to make this happen
A	right okay
B	and I will really really rely on fucking massive favours from people to get it to happen for that for that launch
A	mm
B	and we will be away in the UK for the launch so that will be very advantageous
B	no you and I will be dealing it you you're testing this rebel location right? that's what I thought we were doing
A	yeah yeah no no no that's fine so you wanna test it from afar
B	yeah absolutely
A	yeah that's okay
B	remote that's what we're talking about
A	absolutely that's fine
B	yeah
A	that's absolutely fine so you get to you get to get a a kind of a full dog hog kind of understanding of
B	plus
A	where the
B	we'll have three weeks
B	hanging out with my dad who'll be loving it my brother will come up have a look
A	mm
B	and he will totally engage with it
A	mm
B	and he will just start pumping ideas in
A	yeah yeah
B	he might even give us people
A	mm
B	to connect with and make it even better
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so we've gotta be on the UK ground so
A	so that's what you're interested in trying to get a a a a right buy in from?
B	yeah
A	yeah okay alright I can
B	yeah
A	that deadline so erm
B	yeah
A	yeah we made a big list so I think it's kind of a case of having to crack on but do a bit of each every day
B	yeah
A	rather than do that chunk and then do that chunk and then that chunk
B	yeah
A	I mean there is priorities but
B	we'll we'll give them
A	you need to do a little bit each day so you don't kind of find that it's a struggle
B	given the given the new er impetus
A	er explain what what you expect to be delivered
B	a website
A	and?
B	erm
A	carry on
B	erm and all of the directional traffic around it going straight leading into the website
A	er okay so you're talking about any peripheral stuff that helps feed traffic into the site
B	yeah
A	okay so I mean the it
B	I hate those fucking balls cos they could just come
A	oh they it's not gonna come over near us
B	are you sure?
A	it's alright they're way over there one's wearing an English rugby jersey
A	and the other is South African yeah and they've got an Aussie football ball
A	yeah it's a bit of shitty oh no it's er yeah it is it's a
B	yeah
A	and I can actually start getting a better credit and credos by doing you know this is where I sit outside the box with a lot of these
B	yeah
A	and it's gonna be the same in this case I do that to start with
B	yeah
A	not this
B	yeah
A	and that's where the project management awareness and skill comes in
B	yeah
A	and really it comes down to you look at it and you go well I haven't got time to do this so I I have to outsource it
B	yeah
A	yeah and it's better probably to start with and you say well we'd if we set a budget of X that that money is some of it is set aside for getting others to get certain things done for us
B	yeah
A	and in some context I would prefer to use some of the
B	it's up to you
A	then
B	if if that's it's
A	I'd go somewhere else and try the outsourcing thing
B	but I see there's clearly defined roles that's your role that's
A	yeah
B	for to decide
A	absolutely fine but you understand that we need we might need some money to be able to
B	yeah
A	facilitate that to make that easy
B	yeah
A	and probably it's easier to do it that way and get good product
B	yeah
A	straight up
B	okay so who wants to be in control of that money budget thing?
A	well I think er just need to schedule a a bunch of things and say well which bits am I gonna do and which bits are we gonna outsource? and then look at relatively how much of my cost
B	who wants to be control of costing?
A	I'm happy to cost everything
B	okay
A	er we obviously
B	mm
A	erm we obviously erm
B	I might need some flyers done just for when you're going around to different parts of Asia or when you're in cities and things and you maybe you know just have a postcard or something that kind of has you know the actual
A	and a website
B	website
A	like an oversized business card
B	yeah so you can hand it out to students
A	yeah yeah for sure
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that would be really useful
A	mm
B	cos we need that trajectory over into erm er Asia Pacific
A	yeah and exactly and so
B	and in New Zealand I can do the same
A	mm
B	when I'm in
A	yeah yeah yeah exactly
B	so we get them coming in straight away
A	mm so that kind of stuff needs to be designed what's the content what's gonna go on it
B	yeah
A	erm you know and and you you hit at things with you know we're gonna have a launch date and that's er so before you get that hand that stuff out you wanna you wanna landing page up
B	mm
A	on your website
B	yeah
A	you know
B	well well we really want what you did with
A	mm
B	that's really what you want
A	yeah that's right and I can use that same template if that's what you like and I can make it look better than it did for them
B	well if it speeds the whole process up then yeah use the same template
A	well it's it's it's a template called Launch Effect
B	right
A	yeah and part of the thing that
B	right
A	so then you say well you look at the top five of them and you go well we're going to do something for these people
B	okay
A	and you could say the carrot could be you could be one of our first interviewees
B	yeah yeah absolutely now
A	something like that
B	there's another part to this
A	carry on
B	so you know when we were talking about how erm that fella erm keeps finding all these tools on the internet and we reckoned he didn't do that himself that he just got someone to do it for him close up on Facebook?
A	yes
B	I need to have
A	yeah
B	I don't know how to
A	and then and and others and they'll interact yeah? so you want there's a part of your website a forum that that punters can sign up register and interact on
B	alright but I
A	like a wiki
B	I need to be there every now and then like you
A	yeah but you can drop and drop out
B	sure
A	so that's exactly what happens on
B	but I don't want that person to really think that
A	Location Rebel
B	exactly but I don't really want that person to be me I want it to be somebody else
A	yeah that's fine well many people on Location Rebel for instance get paid to do that stuff
B	excellent
A	right? so but you want somebody who's in education basis
B	I could get
B	yeah
A	great
B	she's smart
A	yeah and and
B	she was always a good student
A	yeah she can write
A	yes exactly so you want
B	mm
A	don't have to pay them anything
B	just to start now exactly
A	yes erm
B	but with a view that eventually when it really kicks off
A	well it it could it could be yeah exactly erm and
A	yeah well she no she she sounds quite nice she's just kinda she's really helpful
B	but we could also use
B	you know you give them a list of things to do
A	yeah
B	they just do it in a day
B	mm
A	and all of that kind of stuff
B	both of them can write really well
A	yeah yeah so anybody that you feel happy with trying to get involved and that fine absolutely and I'm happy to be the go-between to make sure that the the organisational message goes out to say this week we need to try and do this are you available to do this?
B	yeah
A	let me know what you can do
B	yeah
A	or you can't do
B	yeah
A	and if you have two or three people then you just share the wealth
B	yeah
A	absolutely
B	yeah
A	and that's all a part of what a company's about
B	yeah
A	and it's better to do it with people that you can rely on that you don't have to pay much for
B	yeah
A	and
B	pay them in kind anyway there's always a way to negotiate these things
A	yeah yeah well the the kind for
B	yeah exactly
A	or whatever
B	yeah
A	you know and that's fine by me
B	I mean I could also erm you know proofread
B	okay now so that's that bit
A	yes
B	oh okay by the way I'm thinking of asking
A	I don't yeah okay whoever
B	well you have to meet him
A	yes
B	yeah
A	okay mm
B	but at the moment he's the only one I can think of who might actually possibly do it
A	can you trust him?
B	yes
A	and what's he lecture?
B	er well he's er lectured in quite a number of things but erm he's in the marketing and management department of
A	right
A	mm
B	could be
A	yeah so is he
B	he's er he's also double he's so he got a double degree in law and social science and economics
A	okay so you can handle erm
B	and he's a doctor
A	having him involved and trust him to be involved
B	yeah
A	without screwing us or anything like that?
B	no he wouldn't screw us over
A	alright
B	he's either in or he's out that's
A	yeah
B	the way it would be
A	okay
B	okay and then
A	it's not that hard yeah
B	no erm and er then we go to the conference and we start rubbing up against people
A	right
B	so that's the lead time
A	okay so what is it that you hope to get out of
B	yeah
A	digitally?
B	yeah and I'll tell you who's gonna come in on this
A	do you think you'll make any money out of
B	fuck yeah
A	yes I know that
B	so I don't care if it's
A	do you make any money out of publishing through
B	we make
A	another company?
B	yes we make
A	well can't you self-publish?
B	ah now then you're talking right but that's really really long-term and the people who could potentially
B	I need
A	and and and
B	I need names I need big names I need two three doctorates
A	mm
B	I would have to be catching up with them then
A	er you're talking about publishing academic articles?
B	publishing study skills books on how to argue
A	so you're talking about those being distributed amongst educational institutions?
B	yeah
A	rather than something that's a self-help book for students that they buy off a bookshop shelf?
B	yeah this is selling back to it's
A	or through Amazon
B	it's
A	so that's based on volume?
B	yeah
A	and so why wouldn't you just steer the students to buy straight off a web website and self-publish?
B	alright do both
B	but do you know what something else happens?
A	mm
B	is a lot of the time the institutions yeah don't fucking know how to teach so what they do is they buy the licence to the textbook so they actually put that into the syllabus of their unit
A	yeah okay because that tells the appropriate story
B	and they get the student to buy a subscription so they get to practise it
A	right
B	yeah
A	we talked about
B	a flyer yeah
A	a flyer
B	mm
A	erm we want
B	mm
A	and Google Plus
B	mm
A	do you use Google Plus?
B	mm
A	mm okay that's good I haven't got my head into yet but I need to the idea is to connect all this stuff together so the messages are much the same they're just spread amongst it
B	mm
A	yeah erm
B	so I need to come up with the message
A	yes
B	I need to have a erm self intro video that explains the dogma
A	so is that something you put up on YouTube or Vimeo or something?
B	I don't know I don't get it I don't know do you have to be on YouTube? does it have to be can you not have it on your website?
A	well there look that
B	mm
A	so if you put it up on YouTube it's like marketing you you're putting it out there into the masses
B	alright then
A	and then what you're doing is you're providing a message in your video to go back to your website
B	okay
A	so that's how you would get messages that go through that and come back to get people to sign up their emails
B	okay
A	yeah? erm so self intro video and you could put that on YouTube or Vimeo or whatever
B	mm
A	and then you can say to people go and have a look at this that's quite you know
B	interview some people
A	so how many?
B	erm
A	five?
B	hang on a minute
A	well we're talking about one a week yeah?
B	yeah so that will get me if it's if week one is erm twenty-ninth of that will get me to mid-semester break
A	do you want more?
B	so we've got ninth of September is mid-semester break so basically
A	so you want six?
B	yeah
A	six
B	so so yeah shall I give you the week numbers?
A	no erm that's yeah but you'd be doing them June through July yeah?
B	yeah
A	yeah okay carry on
B	but the whole point is that I can do them remotely
A	yeah that's fine
B	yeah I can do them in the the Sunday night and then post them up on a Monday morning
A	yeah but you need to edit them
B	no he said you don't he doesn't
A	erm what you do edit is not edit out the content but when when you film it right you've got two you've got two things you've got the the other person and you've got you
B	yeah
A	so it records both of those pictures
B	yeah
A	and what you edit is you cut them together so it's like you're speaking they're speaking you're speaking they're speaking
B	oh right
A	yeah? which isn't hard to do because you just go through the tape and it's like you're talking so then you show a picture of you
B	mm
A	and then they're talking
B	that's what
A	let me go back and have a look at it
B	yeah
A	right
B	look at it
A	I mean you wanna cut down that crap as much as you can but
B	well let's do it exactly like how
A	are you happy with what you see there?
B	yeah it works for him
A	yes
B	it'll work for us
A	mm okay yes so what we're saying is is study
B	yeah
A	Vodburner costs a hundred dollars
B	right
A	you can use it as a trial
B	mm
A	so you can try it as a trial
B	mm
A	and you can probably outsource it
B	mm
A	so you just get somebody for a fiver to to to edit it together for you
B	alright
A	if you can and provide easy instructions which is when I'm talking I wanna see a picture of me and when I and he's talking I wanna see a picture of him
B	I actually quite I think if you find they're actually both
A	if it's both of them
B	simultaneous
A	then that's fine you know
B	that's like a
A	and that works
B	that's like a conversation
A	yeah okay
B	by the way they're never gonna they are meant to be no more than ten minutes long
A	er that's what you want
B	it's dogma
A	er er yeah okay erm
B	what software does he use for the podcast?
A	erm
B	that means you have to have Apple
A	well we've got Apple
B	no but do students have Apple?
A	no but it gets distributed through RSS and stuff so I've got it on my phone through
B	okay
A	right? so
B	okay
A	so everybody gets to see it
B	so then the thing
A	however they see it
B	that's gonna take a lot of time I think is actually me coming up with a dogma and a sort of format and you just format these interviews yeah? it's it there is a little bit of er kind of wavering a bit around with creativity
A	but you want systems that are straightforward
B	yeah
A	bam bam bam bam bam
B	yeah yeah
A	that's it you don't wanna be fucking around with oh I want it to look good I wanna change it
B	yeah
A	the reality is is that it's only the graphic designers that really want to try and put that kind of shit together
B	so yeah so we need something that will appeal to the young audience
A	yes exactly
B	okay? and I'm defining for you who the
A	yes
B	erm so they are erm eighteen
A	okay now
B	no
A	his thing
B	not having that no
A	that's fine
B	don't want it it's looks babyish and it gives the wrong signal I'm not interested in Second Life fucking you know war of war of world of no
A	mm
B	yeah and I'm probably gonna get some shit for it from from trolls and stuff yeah okay but
A	no that's fine absolutely that's that's that absolutely right
B	so it's just the play on words of Stig Sage
A	mm
B	everyone's fucking seen erm what's it called?
A	Top Gear
B	yeah
A	erm
B	and if it's not
