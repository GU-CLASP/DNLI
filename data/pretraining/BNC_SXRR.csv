A	it's so upsetting
B	fester
A	fester
B	erm
A	to shovel the food?
B	to shovel
A	mm
B	no I've got the fish for next for second dinner
A	mm
A	yeah just tell that you hate her
B	mm
A	right
B	yes
A	mm
B	so when we're both we both have to play the game of just nod and she might stop speaking soon and realise that she's the only one that's been talking in this conversation
A	yeah those people never get the hint though do they?
B	no
A	is she the older one that's got the kids? No
B	no kids
A	mm
B	well no you're thinking of
A	mm
B	she's on team Amy though
A	oh
B	mm
A	mm
B	has gone down to
A	somewhere west
B	somewhere
A	oh right
B	or like
A	but you don't know
B	I don't know
A	right
B	erm I mean I'm the only person that knows that that's the part of her personal development plan to go and work in a cluster cos she just works for
A	mm
B	usually sales managers manage a couple of hotels so she's had a really easy ride of it
A	oh that's interesting
B	yeah
A	no
B	whereas
A	mm
B	so that's how she's ended up being so good
A	mm
B	but she's basically passed it off to everyone else as if they've requested her to go and sort it out
A	she's a nob
B	mm
A	well at least that gets her out your hair for two weeks
B	mm
A	mhm
B	she's been in sales for a year and a half
A	is that it? She's already a sales manager
B	mhm
A	mm
B	her figures aren't high enough
A	mm
B	she's just been fortunate
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	yeah but it still doesn't seem fair though if you're the in a different department and that option isn't available to you and you're working your arse off for little credit
B	mm
A	mm
B	and she's like that
A	bitch
B	I know
A	there's no sense of like unity then is there
B	no
A	yeah fair enough
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and we'll get to it when I get to it
A	mm
B	Cos she just says it
A	mm
B	and we have to put contacts together for her when she should be able to do a contract herself
A	she doesn't want to do it
B	so she doesn't want to do it
A	mm
B	she's just doing it to be
A	mm
B	and that's another thing
A	yeah?
B	Cos
A	what?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	so
A	right
A	she is a douche
B	yeah and she said
A	okay
B	so there's a big massive
A	mm
B	yeah
A	no
A	oh what a nob
B	yeah she's so  she's so  bad
A	mm
B	and it works for her career like being that type of person is great for sales
A	mhm
B	Cos you pass the buck
A	yeah yeah
B	but I just can't understand how you could be that awful
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you couldn't pay me enough
B	yep
A	mm mm
B	I just thought of something
A	what did you think of?
B	I wonder if there's some type of sexy underwear
A	oh where can we get that from?
B	from
A	mm
B	and you even if you could see it
A	mm
B	yeah I love birthday shopping
A	have a little drink somewhere
B	yeah
A	shopping and drinking
B	always a winner
A	and birthday
B	I really want to open my ring
A	oh how exciting
B	yeah
B	it nearly got opened
A	but it will be here for Saturday
B	yeah
A	are you going to just wear it for best
B	no
A	no
B	I want to wear it all the time but I can't wear it for work
A	mm
B	it's to go here
A	okay
B	and it will go next to the gold band
A	mm
B	yeah I really want it
A	lovely
B	and this one was for eighteenth and this one was for Christmas of twenty first and that one's for the twenty fifth
A	perfect
B	yep
A	go Dad
B	yeah
B	like the clasps are on show and they shouldn't be and it's not finished perfectly
A	mm
B	it's really nice
A	you never get what sorry?
B	the stone it's lapis lazuli
A	mm
B	which is why this is a er sapphire
A	not amber
B	they do it with
B	really
A	yeah
B	bloody buggers
A	but then  but then  it would be just your own
B	of secret wonderfulness
A	that everyone would be really jealous by
B	erm
A	yourself
B	that's fine by me
A	that's more than enough
B	that's enough people for me to
A	yeah
B	Cos I I mean I sound like I don't like being around people
A	yeah
B	it's just that I always hate it when you have to herd people around
A	yeah
B	if someone goes to the toilet and then three people go to the toilet and there's four of you stood and whereas if it was a small group then you would be with people the whole time
A	yeah
B	so I think I'll text
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah cos I thought you weren't going to invite any of them cos then at least that's safe
B	yeah
A	well if you're going to invite any of them then yeah
B	yeah
A	it's a tough one though because you shouldn't
B	yeah I mean if it was just her then fine but she doesn't go anywhere on her own
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah he's nice
A	really? Is that because she's never really liked it or she's just got old?
B	just got old
A	naff off
B	in fact what I might do is maybe tomorrow at work say we're gonna go out on Saturday
A	yeah
B	we're gonna probably have some drinks at the hotel first
A	yeah
B	and then at least no one feels like they have to
A	yeah
B	mm
A	Cos if we were
B	yeah and we can start the
A	and we can
B	yes and do the nails
A	yeah do the nails
A	mm all that stuff
B	yeah
A	Cos it's your birthday
B	I don't think
A	baby
B	I don't know
A	is she going to come?
B	I don't know
A	yeah absolutely
B	oh no I forgot about this devil lettuce
B	I mean it is dying now I must admit it's on it's last legs
A	it's a risky business
B	the lettuce of death
A	erm
B	what time do you think is appropriate time?
A	be at the hotel for seven do you think? It depends if you want to eat
B	yea I was going to say
A	no
B	Cos I I'm I'm not really one for like eating and then drinking cos then I'll feel full and I'll feel flat
A	it depends what time you go out
B	yeah
A	make a little buffet
B	yeah with the Italian hams
A	and prawns with chilli sauce
B	and prawns with chilli sauce
A	Cos I have prawns and we can  we can  get the chilli sauce cos we have chilli
B	we can make a good chilli sauce or buy the chilli sauce
A	mm
B	or leave here at seven say
A	yeah
B	come around if you want to or meet us there
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos that's the thing
B	yeah
A	yes
B	obviously erm
A	that will need to happen
B	it's that I I want to be able to enjoy having a drink
A	mm
B	nail painting
A	ah
B	I mean I don't know how you do that because I just was picking my nail polish off and that happened by accident
A	right
B	but erm you know
A	we could  we could we could  attempt
B	guides
A	some guides
B	erm yeah so what I could do is erm make a list of all the things I need
A	yeah
B	and then on Friday when I get paid go and pick the stuff up in my lunch break and or after work because I finish at five
A	mm
B	and then
A	yeah
B	they're not going to mind are they
A	well the shops
B	on Friday?
A	yeah I don't know what time the shops in town close
B	could go in my lunch
A	you could go in your lunch
B	yeah
A	yeah then you'll have to cart them around on
B	yeah
A	yes yes
B	Cos if I choose choose other things
A	mm
B	I do have a little gold handbag
A	yeah mine died
B	do you think I can wear the
A	for the wedding
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean the only thing is once they go you look like Nora Batty
B	yes that is an issue
A	Cos then
B	they can come off
A	mm
B	if I get a quite like a a white off white blazer
A	mm
B	and wear
A	mm
B	so if I get a gold bag at least that will go with the gold sandals for the wedding
A	yeah for wedding
B	and the gold one to
A	lovely
B	that could be a winner
A	oh my dress
B	and the new dress
A	and the new dress
B	yeah
A	okay
B	I love your pink dress
A	and it did look nice with the tan
B	the tanage
A	and obviously that's the thing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I said she'll probably wear the pink one but it's it's a spring it's a really nice formal dress that could be either a winter one or a summer one
A	yeah
B	I mean you could wear that dress in July
A	yeah I suppose that's it is quite versatile
B	yeah
A	but maybe I need to get some silver things or gold things
B	some silver or some gold yeah
A	erm I think I'm seeing one of the
B	right that's exciting
A	he has three motorbikes
B	right
A	the thing is I fear that their personalities might get confused like I might
B	yes
A	Cos I might say stuff to him that is for the other guy
B	yep
A	but that's just the risk you take
B	which I can understand seeming as
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	oh yeah
A	my concern is he is wearing his jumper around his shoulders which is a bit of a  thing to do
B	mm
A	he looks quite nice
B	I like six foot two
A	Cos it's not too  it's not too  like with
B	mm
A	it's nice isn't it
B	I want to bite it
A	yeah cos he's got like proper proper pecks and stuff so
B	mm
A	it's quite good
A	erm but he doesn't live
A	those places that are called
B	yes
A	so I think if he comes to
B	mhm
A	erm so he's gonna get a hotel
B	fine
A	so he should do that
B	mm
A	and he says he's been a few times
B	no
A	he's he's pretty keen
B	it's so hard to read somebody isn't it
A	yeah
B	you've got to wait for
A	yeah and it could go either way
B	er awesome
A	Good
B	I do like the loads of salt yes
A	mm
B	the thing is I'm a bit dubious about signing up for dinner
A	yeah
B	mm
A	the unions on fire
B	mhm
A	etcetera etcetera
B	I mean I think all first dates should have a ten minute cap
A	yeah
B	like enough for you to finish one drink and then you get to say yes or no
A	no hard feelings
B	mhm
A	but it's always going to be hard feelings
B	yeah
A	but yeah
B	and then if not no
A	yeah if not yeah carry on
B	mm
A	I mean it's all  it's all  based on appearances obviously but then most of this thing is
B	mhm
A	and you probably you would presume that they only message you based on what you look like
B	yeah
A	oh hilarious
B	erm and all all the girls all that came up had all got like fake hair
A	is that what they all look like?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	Cos I suppose that's the thing cos you don't know what the other girls look like because you wouldn't ever be erm staring at them would you
B	no
A	oh
B	yeah like you know my witch photograph?
A	they're just
B	worse than that
A	oh my God
B	really fake
A	oh my God
B	mm
A	mm
B	boobs out
A	oh God
B	mm
A	delete
B	yeah delete
A	no
B	mm
A	or what you know that other fellas do you know most of the fellas are to be honest
B	there's lots of filthy girl as well
A	well there probably are
B	filth pots
A	well I think cos a lot of people are using things for cheating
B	mm
A	so erm yeah
B	I never thought of that
A	I had one guy who was really weird
B	what the fuck? Yeah
A	yeah it was really unfair
B	waste somebody else's time
A	yeah and he was like oh well you know that's all girls say that and you know I'm not just here for sex
B	yeah
A	you know I'm here to meet a fella for a good time and maybe more
B	yeah
A	so he really took
B	fucking weirdos
A	so I reported him as abuse
B	I would totally done that
A	mm
B	I was talking to a guy once who called me and I was on the phone to him for about an hour or something
A	mm
B	erm just chatting away
A	yeah
B	easy enough to get on with
A	mm
B	but fine
A	yeah
B	it wasn't too much
A	mm
B	erm but yeah fair enough
A	mm
B	anyway
A	erm
B	and he'd had me on the phone for an hour
A	Jesus
B	and he was like no
A	what?
B	so I work in like retail and people see me all the time and so I don't want my colleagues know I'm on here or people that come into the store to ask my advice to know that it's me on here
A	yeah yeah
B	Don't put a fake one on there and leave me talking to the fake person for an hour
A	mm
B	at least I don't  I don't  think particularly think I'm superficial I just think because it's  because it's  internet dating you do base your decision on luck because you don't know them
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah I just think it's really mean
B	yeah
A	mm mm
C	hi ladies
A	hiya
B	hiya
C	how are we doing?
B	Good
A	Great
C	yeah yeah
A	how's your tooth?
C	it's alright
B	how's work?
C	boring
A	why?
C	it's just
A	it takes a while to get bedded in doesn't it
C	yeah
A	mm
C	you know there's two hundred and eighty employees there
A	mm
B	I just think you don't  you don't  really know what the jobs like till like the three month point
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	mm it's quite daunting isn't it
A	when it's a big staff like that
C	yeah just thrown in the deep end but you know that that's alright
A	that's a bit young isn't it?
B	mm mm
C	he he well he's a student at AIU and he he's just there for the money
A	mm
C	so he just
A	mm
C	you know out of work but as far as work goes he doesn't do a lot
A	well they'll probably weed him out quite quickly like security surely that's not going to be okay
B	yeah
C	he he's he's just he he does what he needs to do basically
A	mm
C	you know but
B	fine
C	you know each to their own
A	mm
C	what do you think of your doors then
B	very nice
C	I like them

C	where did you get that from?
B	er Dorothy Perkins
C	ah good old DP

C	so did you get it from the leisure park I mean
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	Good?
C	yeah
B	I'm not convinced
C	the story line is wicked
A	she's not in the third one?
C	no
A	oh
C	Cos I don't
A	is she in the forth one?
C	yeah
A	oh
C	which is probably why she wasn't in it
A	is that the one with the vampires
C	mm
A	yeah I have seen them
C	yeah it's
A	did I remember they dig up the old vampire and he's in the ground in the big house and he comes out the ground and he's like eight hundred years old and they've got to ask him a question?
C	mm
A	oh yeah that's it
C	and it
A	but they're not supposed to
C	yeah they raise him like a century early just so Kate can release this news that she's
B	no no no no no
C	oh have you not seen it?
B	no
C	oh okay
A	yeah I quite liked it actually
C	yeah I'm going to watch the forth one now

C	well I had one of those microwave meals today
B	Good
C	dead impressive
B	oh
C	yeah
B	baby mush

B	Good
C	and I didn't realise it was spicy so I took a big mouthful of it and because I just I literally just run it round my mouth and swallow
B	spice your face off
C	I coughed my guts up
B	Good
A	mm
B	yeah yeah he's like really on the ball all the time like give us a break
A	mm
B	which leads me to believe that perhaps he's not quite the type of
A	it sounds like he's not got a lot going on in his life if he can text you all the time
B	yeah yeah well he's had
A	mm
B	so
A	mhm
B	erm he's going to Orlando next month with his friends which you can only afford to do if you live with your mum and dad
C	mhm
A	oh is he a baby?

A	grass cutter
C	there's a  there's a  lots of grounds men at the golf course and their them just cutting grass
B	alright
C	but yeah he basically cuts grass and maybe
A	trims the trees
B	he does something
A	and makes the holes nice

B	twenty-six I think
A	jeebus
B	yeah
A	yeah basically he's just

B	so he was like oh do you wanna go out for a drink? Fine
A	yeah
B	erm fine er are you free this week? He says oh I'm off work tomorrow if that's any good as in today
B	and he was like oh yeah I didn't think that through properly

B	oh yes
A	so well I mean not just you
B	yeah
A	so even if you were not

A	yeah absolutely
B	so that's that
A	the Afghan guy

B	yeah yeah yeah so he's still a year older than me yeah
A	fine
B	mm

B	I have no idea
A	yeah cos if he's cannon fodder it's a no
B	fucked
A	yeah
B	it's going to be an abort
A	for
B	yeah
A	in the granny dress?

B	do you know what I need?
A	A cake?
B	cake or phish food
A	where is the phish food ice cream?
B	like I actually am debating whether I can possibly drive to Tesco's and get the phish food
A	or
B	phish food
A	you've got to really want to go
B	it's really bad
