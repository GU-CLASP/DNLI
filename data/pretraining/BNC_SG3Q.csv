A	hmm?
B	mm
B	well if we well we'll just all do it
A	mm
B	and then we'll
A	me
B	well no
A	oh right
B	are you sure?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	after dinner?
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	A
C	really?
B	mm
C	that's exciting
B	how sarcastic was that?
C	no it wasn't
B	oh right
C	it is quite exciting
C	only taken three years
A	oh nice
C	I haven't listened to the Stereophonics for quite some time
B	neither have I actually
C	I don't have this album in its entirety
A	oh it's it's good
C	I like Word Gets Around
A	I
C	right
A	overall
B	yeah
C	oh Peter
B	yep
B	well cos I was mixing it between the two glasses
A	oh
B	I couldn't be bothered
A	wow
C	that is quite impressive
A	I guess we'll just leave all all the stuff for tomorrow in in a bag
A	yeah yeah
C	so who's gonna listen to this recording?
A	um
C	we are  we are  allowed to talk about the recording while it's recording aren't we?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	um
B	we shouldn't do really
B	so the the they don't seem to understand the basic experimental concept
A	the only people who will listen to them are the transcribers
C	transcribers?
A	um
C	oh so people are writing down
A	what you're saying
C	conversations?
A	yeah
C	okay
A	and then um
C	and then it gets fed through some process doesn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	um then put into yeah this sort of online um software thing
C	yeah
A	um
B	er that's
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	that bad boy
A	is it any good?
B	that's for tomorrow
A	huh?
B	your feminine products somewhere else?
C	that's gonna sound really dodgy on the recording isn't it
A	right
C	can I clarify for the sake of the recording that
C	it's just shampoo
C	that's all it is
A	it's fairly feminine shampoo
C	where is the recorder by the way? Oh it's there
B	oh actually
A	move it over here
C	does it pick up everything?
A	um it's yeah it's pretty good
C	it's gonna pick up quite a lot of music isn't it as well
A	yeah
C	how much of a direct range you're using? That's cool
B	cool
C	you just maxed it out then by
C	cupboard
A	yeah
A	it doesn't like that
B	ooh that's a  that's a  good looking bottle
C	yeah
A	oh my God
C	we're gonna try some of that later
B	naturally
C	as long as you're okay with that
B	yeah
C	I dunno don't know what you're like with whisky
B	ooh
C	you might be
A	oh
B	wow
A	that's cool
C	I thought you might be just one of those people who buys it puts it on a shelf and looks at it for a while
C	like sort of admires it
C	caresses it
B	no
C	that's good
B	um
C	has your bin got two compartments?
B	mm
A	it's a recycly one so
B	both's recycling
C	oh right
B	no
C	it's split the other way?
B	well incidentally
B	notice how this bin could almost have been custom made
C	I like the the well damped response of the er
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	there's only so much you can  there's only so much you can  do with a bin
C	but that's quite impressive
B	that is a hundred pounds worth of bin
C	oh that's quite expensive
C	I think ours was like five pound from Tesco
A	oh  oh it's a  it's a horrendously expensive bin
B	yes please
A	okay
B	um
C	do you want me to do something cooking wise?
A	um
C	chop something or? I like chopping things
B	there's not really anything to chop
A	I don't think there's actually anything to chop
C	I can chop garlic
A	do you wanna dice some garlic?
C	yep
A	um
B	can you not
C	yeah
A	behind the piccalilli
B	poke my face
A	sorry
B	ouch
C	behind
A	behind the piccalilli
B	Dan
C	no
B	oh
A	spice rack?
B	sorry spice this
C	right
B	er
A	terrifying
B	this is one of my
C	that's pretty cool
B	I'm not sure
C	Sugar vanilla? What's that?
B	exactly
C	mix for moussaka and
A	Greece didn't it?
B	yeah
C	did you
B	um
C	when you came over
B	can't remember it
A	er
A	I think I was putting drinks on it
C	at the end of the kitchen on the right
B	yep
C	where we have a shelf that's about the length of your windowsill
A	nice
C	but er it's just loads and loads of spices
C	is that a word?
B	mm
C	is a word
A	yeah yeah
C	isn't it? So yeah
A	um
C	or just?
B	that's a lot of garlic
C	I you don't mess about with garlic
A	I'd I'd only just put
C	okay
A	one or two cloves in
C	okay
A	so
C	two then
A	yeah
C	three? Two? Three?
A	er
C	let's go three
A	how much should we?
B	push the boat out
A	yeah
B	go three
A	push the boat out
A	could put Tabasco in it
B	er
C	um
C	Cos we all put loads of garlic in everything
B	right
A	so basically the order doesn't really matter
C	yeah
B	um
C	oh we've actually secretly got four
C	that double one was masquerading as a single one
B	er three lemons
A	um I think
B	okay
A	I'm just subsisting on surviving on beer until um
B	it's a good way to survive
C	yeah
A	yeah it's good yeah
C	didn't monks used to drink it?
B	who?
C	or mead
A	mm
C	monks in the Middle Ages used to
B	we've got mead
A	we've got mead
C	have you?
B	yeah
C	really?
C	weird stuff isn't it
A	yeah
C	it's just made from honey
A	I quite like sweet
C	mm
A	drinks so
B	mm
C	so
C	could I
A	close to complex
C	could I feasibly
A	yeah yeah
C	to your department?
A	if you've got a recorder yeah
C	really?
A	you you do you want me to send the info to you?
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	Cos I've got quite a good MP3 player with a microphone built in
A	ah
C	so
A	I'll send you the info
B	yes
C	no I garlic presses are pretty inefficient though
A	true
C	I I just like chopping it
A	fair enough
B	you can cut finer than that man honestly
C	sorry? Yeah you can get it finer than that
B	you call that chopping?
A	er basically now is just
B	I'll just open all the tins
A	put everything in a frying pan
C	okay
A	oh yeah get some tins of tomatoes out
C	yeah
B	oh no those two need a
C	get your act together
B	ah
A	are you snaffling?
B	yes
C	it'd be quite an interesting job
B	we want four tins of anchovies
C	doing the transcribing I reckon for these
A	yeah
C	Cos you must have some very strange conversations going on
A	well I
B	well our conversations are fecking weird
C	and I bet a lot of the conversations are just about the the the the thing itself
A	yeah
B	A lot of the conversations are very sort of artificial
C	yeah
B	literally
C	yeah
B	on the entire time
C	yeah
B	and that's yeah but it's very natural
C	it's high quality
B	we we we just forget it's there
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so do you get paid per recording? Or per hour? Or?
A	per hour of recording
C	and how how much is it per hour?
A	eighteen
C	eighteen pounds? That's really good
A	yeah
B	and tax
C	I'd
A	yeah
C	taxed? They tax it do they?
B	unfortunately
C	and how who taxes it? How is it taxed?
C	oh right
B	um well actually you wouldn't
C	I'd just
A	you you declare it on your um
C	oh er so I have to do like I have to fill in a an extra tax return for it then?
B	in theory
A	hang on you don't need four
B	we normally have two for
C	for two
B	so I was just gonna put four in
C	is
B	no
A	he said he's having a Co-op sandwich
C	A what?
A	co-op sandwich
B	although there'll probably be
C	right
B	some cheese and
C	got
B	no for cheese
C	oh cheese biscuits
B	actually we
A	there are some biscuits there
B	not many
A	there's some oat cakes and there's some of those
C	oh we've got quite a lot
B	there's virtually none of those
C	not particularly
B	oh fuck it
B	oh well
C	so what what er what exactly are you  are you  making?
A	um this is um
C	it's obviously got anchovies and garlic and tomato in it
A	anchovies
C	lemons
A	lemons
C	that sounds really good
B	it is
A	it's it's
C	it's an unusual combination as well
A	it's dead easy
B	er two er how many tomatoes
A	um three
C	it's quite
B	three
B	we've only got
B	we buy these things in bulk
A	well you say we buy them
C	why do you go to Sainsbury's? Can't you buy a similar from Morrisons?
B	um
A	we bought them when we moved in
B	we just basically stocked up
A	yeah
B	filled the entire cupboard up
C	yeah
A	which
B	er
A	means we yeah I mean we uh damn it
B	hob Brite
B	sorry
C	yeah
A	hob Brite
C	hob?
A	you cleans the hob really well
C	hob Brite
A	hob Brite
C	oh right yeah
B	tell you what
B	if you're worried
C	Cos we've got quick a similar hob in our house
A	oh
C	that's gonna go in
A	yeah
C	take ages to respond
B	no it doesn't
A	to cool it down it's quite hard
B	yeah yeah to once you've finished cooking to cool it's a pain but er
C	that's what I mean
A	yeah
B	oh no but it is actually fairly responsive to that
A	you reckon?
B	yeah
C	well it'll depend if you've got something sitting on it or not
C	I guess
B	well sort of um using sort of heat transfer the er rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference
A	oh
C	oh it'll be alright
A	never mind
A	it'll fry
C	none of us are fat
B	what the fuck's happened to that?
A	have you destroyed it?
B	huh?
A	have you ruined it?
C	just not working is it
B	ruining your mum
A	that means nothing
B	no er it does actually
A	oh yeah
B	um
A	fair enough
C	explain it for the sake of the recording device
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	it means I'm having very violent sex
A	oh
B	with her such to the point
A	oh
B	where it becomes
A	God
B	painful
A	thanks for that
C	that's the point where I'd abandon all attempts and just leave it
A	wow you really have chewed a bit in the side of that
C	sorry?
A	there's a bit gone out of the side
A	of the tin
B	I think this is going a bit
C	do you want me to er let me have a go with this one
B	okay
A	um
B	adding things
A	cooking pasta to to get ready
B	do we have er tuna?
A	er tuna yeah
B	er I'm pretty ah God actually that was quite dangerous
A	what did?
B	that sharp bit of
B	as in that was about
C	what that one?
B	that was about five mil from the vein on my wrist
A	nasty
C	nice
C	it didn't cut  it didn't cut  the skin though did it? So
B	no
C	mm
B	this
C	see that's that's good cheap cheap tuna
A	well yes
C	right
A	but no one actually looks at the price per hundred grams
C	yeah
A	that's the  that's the  key thing you see
C	I spend so long in the supermarkets looking at like
A	yeah
C	price per unit
A	yeah
C	price per gram or whatever
A	I'm really sad but you know it
C	Cos some of the  some of the  big brands are actually not as bad as you think
A	mm
C	they just  they just
A	that's true
C	sell more more or less than the most
A	mm
A	exactly
C	so as long as you can accept that
B	so um something quite funny happened at work with that
A	should I put these in?
B	with our laser driller
C	yeah
B	and um we got a quote which was about two quid a unit for fifty
B	and I pointed this out to them
B	Cos the quote was still valid and they were obliged to honour it
C	yeah
B	um
C	that's weird
A	that's
B	it was like how
C	they're not I don't know if you are obliged to honour a quote
B	no
C	Cos like if if a supermarket advertises something for a price and the price turns out to be completely wrong
B	no they are
C	then they then no they're not
A	well no like Tesco's advertised their iPads
C	Cos there was a  there was a  thing about um iPads
A	yeah
C	and they  and they  er just decided not to sell it for that price
B	no if actually if you pushed it you could've done that
C	no
A	I I think it's because they
C	no they no no
A	yeah
B	no it's er no no
A	yeah
B	no no it's a
C	no they they can sell
B	but there's a
C	they can sell things for as whatever they want up to the point that you actually give them the money
A	yeah
C	there's no
B	not no that's not
A	okay
B	exactly how it works
A	what love?
B	well it was an interesting example
B	one of the example questions they set us was so what happens if someone puts a poster advertising a reward for a
A	decides they didn't don't care about the dog anymore
B	well no say um for example they take some of the posters down and miss one
C	no
B	legally you are
C	no you're not
B	you are
C	no cos it happens all the time online
A	yeah
C	and they say oh they have to  they have to  honour the price now
B	no
C	no
B	mm
C	well I dunno
B	possibly I'm gonna go with the Oxford law professor on this one
C	right
B	um that's why a lot of so that's why you have to be very careful in the T and Cs you put with the quote
C	but you haven't  you haven't  agreed to anything
A	yeah
C	for a price
B	no
A	can I put some capers on the top?
B	I'll give you an example so it's also the reason that all quotes have um a er valid until
A	how many capers do you want?
B	um
A	lots?
B	Short answer
B	I'm gonna drain some of this
A	just fish them out
C	I
A	Don't drain it all out because
C	there was only three cloves
B	these are un-stoned aren't they?
A	they don't have stones in
B	is the expression pitted?
A	yeah but
B	yeah it is
A	um some if you  if you  say it's stoned though it's hard to know what you mean
A	like it could mean with stones or without stones
C	or it could mean
A	or it could mean yeah
C	been smoking some weed
B	oh yeah
C	oh are they  are they  er drug are they er stoners?
B	are they that way inclined? Yes
C	right
A	did you drain it all out?
B	yes
A	that's how you store them to stop them going off
B	sorry
C	oh
A	I did say to you don't drain all the water out
C	just put some olive oil
B	well it was already in the fridge
B	mm
C	Tesco sell filleted chicken chicken thighs
B	right
C	for cheaper than chicken breasts
A	yeah
C	and it's
A	which is
C	and it's by by mass it is cheaper than chicken breast
A	wow
C	it's crazy
A	yeah
C	Cos it's like
A	yeah
C	much better meat
B	mm
A	is that enough olives and capers?
B	mm
A	you think?
B	er okay
C	can I do anything else?
A	enough capers? No that's pretty much it to be honest
B	no we need some tomato purée
A	tomato purée?
B	mm
A	right
B	um
A	yeah
B	er we'll put the tomato in in a minute
A	yeah
C	so how's work going
B	um
B	well um little bit quiet at the moment
C	yeah
C	oh right
B	so that was quite
C	that's quite
B	well no I disagree with
C	yeah
B	I might be working with a project leader but it's my it's er almost how much work I choose to do on my project
C	yeah
B	um
C	yeah
B	but it's small enough such that
A	oh er pasta's done
B	we'll be doing some
A	do you wanna get the garlic breads out?
B	ooh yeah
A	oh yeah and er and there's
B	Dan would like
C	you what?
A	um there's some garlic breads in the oven
B	oh I thought we'd microwave them
C	yeah
B	whatever
C	yeah
B	so I thought okay well let's
A	there's a plate there if you want er
C	right
B	so
B	let's er let's think about ways we can make this better for people
C	right
B	so I did some came in Monday took my iPad in
C	yeah
B	and it so happened that one of um our guys was in er the States pitching to a company who would be very who would potentially be interested
C	yeah
B	so we've gotta pitch on Thursday
C	that's pretty good
B	yeah
B	literally came up with this idea off the er top of my head
C	yeah
B	on Sunday
C	mm
B	by Thursday it was being presented to one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the States
C	that's quite good isn't it
A	um
B	er it's like because it's small you get that opportunity
C	yeah
B	and
A	cool
B	okay
A	oh
C	why stinging? Have you got a cut on your finger or something?
B	apparently so
C	oh
B	it's a good way to find out if you've got a cut on your finger really isn't it
C	I'll do it if you want
B	er yeah
C	although I've got I've definitely got a cut on my thumb so
A	should I squeeze them?
B	oh you'll squeeze them  you'll squeeze them  good
A	what?
A	again
B	ah
C	if you think about it you could like really artificially do one of these er one of these recordings and just like deliberately make the whole thing full of innuendo
C	or like completely mislead someone and only reveal reveal at the end
C	what you're actually talking about is something completely innocent and
A	yeah
B	well what amused me was the idea of um we had it on in the car
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	or what you could do if you could actually kid somebody into thinking you'd had an accident
A	yeah
B	yep
C	well
B	no
A	it er well
B	not unless they're responding to an emergency and on blues and twos
A	he was just driving yeah I mean he might have forgotten to put his
B	they have to be either training
A	siren out
B	or on blues
B	well you might turn a siren off at night in a residential area
A	is anyone any good at serving spaghetti?
B	pursuing a
C	have you  have you  got a spaghetti server?
A	we haven't got a spaghetti server
B	uh
A	I know
C	er just
A	and a fork
C	just tip it
A	just tip it?
C	yeah
B	A server
C	A fork might be
A	yeah
B	um
A	uh
B	um
A	yeah
B	um
C	I'm gonna have a go at this
C	you're not doing it right
B	oh I'm sorry
C	I'll
C	I'll leave it there
C	there's probably quite a lot of lemon juice in there now anyway
A	oh
C	what's that? Cinnamon?
B	mm
A	oh
B	you didn't put purée in did you?
A	no
B	oh
A	I thought you had
B	no
A	oh
B	we could put it in now the purée
C	where's the purée? Fridge?
A	it's here
B	there
C	oh you've got it
A	we did get it out ready
C	oh
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
C	more tomatoey
A	more?
B	can you yeah can you do it low enough so so it's not spraying everywhere?
B	okay
C	so when they transcribe this conversation
A	yeah
C	do they sort of write it out as if it was a play? So like person A this
A	yeah
C	person B
A	so like the first person to speak's number one
C	oh I see
A	and whenever they speak again they're number one
C	yeah
A	um
C	yeah
A	that gets a little tag round it
C	ah
A	and if somebody uses a word
B	this is really
A	that isn't real
C	yeah
A	this is what? Really what?
B	this
C	so uses a word that isn't real er
A	so as in like if or if if they say like um if someone's a non-native speaker and they use a word slightly wrong
C	right
A	there's a little tag to go they they meant this so that they can
C	so it's like
A	still search it for sense
C	putting brackets sic
A	yeah
C	or
A	yeah
C	ah
A	which is quite good
C	and what about um like obscenities? Do they  do they  censor it at all? Or?
A	no no
C	do they censor
A	um yeah
C	yeah or like  or something
A	but like first names
C	yeah
A	and like I said er you wouldn't ever be searching for a first name
C	yeah
A	right
C	he's gone
A	oh well
C	feel like having some of this wine with it
A	sorry
C	feel like having some of this wine with it
A	yeah yeah
C	have you got some wine-glasses?
A	we've got some excellent wine-glasses
C	oh they're huge
A	they're massive aren't they
C	wow
A	um
A	pardon?
B	let's not make it sound better than it is
A	the Daily Mail wine club
C	it's a what?
A	the Daily Mail yeah
C	the Daily Mail wine
A	do you wanna serve
B	which one's my beer?
C	that sounds like the worst organization in the world
B	which one's my beer?
C	I'm not gonna lie
A	um
C	the colder one
A	yeah
C	that one
B	yep
A	um
B	no
A	rubbish at serving pasta
C	the Daily Mail wine club?
A	well apparently it's quite decent for
B	yeah
C	do they read The Daily Mail as well?
B	no
B	can you not insult them like that? Er it's
C	well I
C	I thought I'd better ask that in case you said yes you know
A	and then you'd be like oh
C	but how
B	well
A	Cos they hear about it from one of their
B	how do you
C	one of their
A	daily Mail reader friends
B	how do you prove you read The Daily Mail?
A	well as in like how did they find out about it? How good it was
C	mm
C	naturally
A	he's quite into his Which?
C	yeah
A	my dad was like
B	your dad was very
C	gonna sit here
A	yeah
C	is that okay?
A	that's fine
C	I'm not like stealing
A	sit anywhere
C	your your own seat or anything?
A	no no
C	hmm
A	okay

A	yeah
C	it's
A	yeah
C	without even realizing
A	it er it's yeah
B	you don't
A	you never have a glass of wine because a glass of wine's a bottle of wine
C	yeah
A	so you always just have a little bit in the bottom
C	yeah
B	yeah cos the formal wine-glass you just get through in a few seconds
A	so it works quite well
C	wow
C	in just
A	yeah
C	three very
A	it was quite small the glasses
C	got er quarter full glasses
C	that's incredible
A	they are mental
B	fantastic
A	they do the job
B	they're like they'd normally probably be about twenty quid a glass
C	right
B	we got eight of them for free
C	mm
A	I'm not sure I'm gonna eat it all
B	that's what your mum says
C	these mats are pretty cool
A	well we ordered them and then six weeks later we were like um can we have our mats? And they were like well you know
B	yeah
A	we did say
B	so they made this place in Wales does them
C	oh right
B	it's er cos John Lewis had like slate mats but they weren't very nice
C	right
B	bluey grey
C	they are pretty nice
B	Cos
C	right
B	um
A	okay
B	er should we get some more
A	some more
B	yes
A	huh
B	uh
C	oh thank you
A	uh

B	er
A	there's a matching tea light holder
C	right
A	yeah yeah go for it
C	no I'm not that greedy
C	well
B	you're that hungry
C	yeah I am hungry

B	oh actually sorry  benedictamus domino
C	yeah
A	oh no
A	just showing off cos you've read grace
C	who does people on that so on that picture up there there's
A	mm
C	who are the other people?
C	that's
A	mm
C	oh
C	I knew  I knew  his name but I never knew who he was
B	no
A	he was the year below
C	oh I think it's
A	possibly
B	can't imagine they have much in common
C	I think it's
A	yeah he's quite artsy
C	right
A	she was two years below
C	oh right
A	mm
B	we were on the same corridor in fourth year
A	your fourth year?
B	well yes obviously
C	presumably she's in not even in her fourth year yet?
A	no she's on her year abroad
C	oh right
A	I think
C	mm
B	as a linguist
C	yep
B	mm
A	is there anything else you do a year abroad for?
B	sorry?
A	guess there isn't
B	er no engineers can
A	okay
B	but we actually spend a year studying
B	well no objectively she's not really studying
A	she is
B	she's attending a few courses
C	I think  I think  it's incredibly difficult doing a year abroad
C	it's a whole year
B	well she's studying German as a foreign language in Italy in Italian
C	yeah
A	mm
B	er I agree that's hard but it's not like
A	and in all fairness she doesn't know you know that's er
C	yeah
B	mm
B	it it's it's she's got a pretty good ratio
C	right
B	going on I think you could quite honestly say
A	still
B	mm
C	mm
B	I'm not sure really
B	oh actually last night you'll never guess where we went
C	no I wouldn't
B	so the type of restaurant that we went to
A	mm
C	was it um Mongolian?
B	close
C	really? What geographically close? Or?
B	um sort of
C	just in terms of obscurity?
A	mm
B	er in terms of obscurity something more obscure
C	was it um North Korean?
B	um close in terms of political leanings
C	oh really?
B	yep
C	was it like um
A	well
A	as in mental you mean?
B	mm
A	rather than as in
C	as in being mental?
B	yeah
A	not similar
C	was it like Iranian or something?
B	yeah
A	yep
C	really?
C	mm
A	um in Hills Road
B	we were just walking past and thought nice
A	it does a lot of stuff that
B	let's try that
C	what sort of food was it?
A	A lot of it's similar to Greek
C	Don't say Iranian
A	so so like a lot of it is um
C	yeah
A	so either different names for hummus and Taramosalata
B	well they're slightly different
A	tzatziki
B	yeah
A	and pitta breads
C	yeah
A	and you can get things like baklava and kleftiko and stuff
B	I was
C	I love baklava
A	mm
B	mm
A	it was really good
B	Saffron ice cream
C	mm
B	that was special
A	and I had Persian tea
C	mm
B	and there was a really nice delicious like it's not lots of herbs and stuff like
A	mm
B	very gently spiced
C	mm
B	hot at all
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know
C	mm
A	and he said it's just like herbs
C	mm
A	and it's not spicy
B	mm
C	mm
B	it was gently impressive
C	mm
A	but
C	mm
A	yeah like we were just walking past
C	yeah
A	you know
B	actually Loch Fyne was full
A	yeah
C	we need to go to some of er some more random restaurants down there
B	mm
C	Cos there are loads of them aren't there
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well there's that one where we went with
C	that was awesome
B	I know
C	that was so good
A	I really wanna go there
B	but I think
C	was that Seven Days or something?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I think it was better as a big group
C	and with someone who's Chinese
C	who knows what to order
B	mm
A	hmm
B	Cos my um having had a Chinese ex-girlfriend helped
C	mm
B	and that was it
A	ooh
B	oh yeah
A	he knows er yeah so um
C	yep
A	and they cooked this amazing Chinese feast
C	yeah
A	basically
B	apparently duck feet oh chicken feet
C	mm
A	chicken feet's a big thing
C	I had chicken feet in Thailand
A	were they good? Cos they they said they would cook them for us
C	no they were stupid
C	it's just
A	yeah
C	mostly bone and sinew and stuff
A	yeah
C	I don't really know what the point in them is
C	mm
A	like surely that's just pointless
C	must be really small
A	yeah
B	it's probably a delicacy
A	the beak is quite small
B	you know caviar slightly odd thing to eat but
A	oh that's true I guess
B	you know people er
A	Don't really like it
B	Don't really like it
C	very good thank you
B	mm
C	it's an interesting flavour combination
B	but nice
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah it works really well
A	I like cinnamon in it I think
C	Cos normally I put cinnamon in sweet stuff
A	mm
C	I've never really put it in like savoury stuff before
B	mm
A	it's really good in moussaka as well
B	it balances the lemon as well
C	mm
A	it is quite an easy way of getting quite a lot of food
C	we've got um got a slow cooker in our house
A	mm
C	we've all started using this slow cooker recently
B	not for meat please
C	not for what?
B	not for meat
C	yeah of course
B	oh God
C	slow cooked chicken is fantastic
B	oh er chicken okay
C	slow cooked meat is very very different to er
C	that'd be ridiculous
B	fine
C	you know
A	mm
C	and you've gotta sort of get that in your head first
C	I mean it
C	like braising steak
A	mm
C	well it's when it once you've slow cooked it for like ten hours it just
C	falls apart and it's really really tasty
A	yeah we could do that
B	mm
B	how does it work?
C	er I I agree like I wasn't sold on it
A	mm
C	er er er either
A	no you
C	make some really
B	mm
C	when it's been cooking like slowly for ten hours
A	so you just you
B	the the problem is
A	some wine and some stuff
C	mm
A	um herbs and spices and whatever and
C	yeah
B	that's essentially a marinade
C	well er
A	yeah but it cooks it though
C	not really
A	so
C	you just marinade is like before you cook it you soak it in some sauce or something don't you
B	yes and you
A	yes but it's basically the meat is cooking in the sauce for
B	the point is it takes it into the structure
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so but does the slow cooker do the same? Or is it just on the surface?
A	well
C	what do you mean on the surface?
B	mm
A	well it's in the sauce for that long
C	it's just a slow cooker is just like a huge pot
B	right
C	that warms up to maybe you know eighty or ninety degrees and sits there for eight hours
A	you put it on in the morning
C	you put it on in the morning
A	and you come back for your dinner
C	and you come back and
A	yeah
C	you eat it in the evening
B	actually I'm sceptical about casseroles and stews because you er well for example your mother
B	has this knack of ruining perfectly nice meat
A	mm
B	by stewing it for hours
C	right
A	but she also cooks everything
C	hmm
C	yeah
C	for like the last fifteen minutes or something
A	yeah
B	not if you're her mother
A	I had someone who had some
C	well I made a  I made a  Thai curry in there and it was actually really good
A	yeah
C	for Thai curries
A	mm
C	it's pretty nice
A	I had something er was it  was it  neck? It think it was lamb neck that she'd bought
C	and stuff like lentils as well
A	mm
C	but if you just put them in
B	I'm not a lentil fan
A	true
C	I like lentils
A	mm
C	I think they're really good
A	mm
C	lentils and meat is a winner
B	I always thought lentils were a carbohydrate source
C	they are
A	you're just biased cos your dad's a massive lentil fan
B	mm I
C	me?
B	mm
C	no
B	mm
C	but a few you know er a few people in my house live sort of almost live vegetarian
B	mm?
C	I'd like to I don't  I don't wanna be I don't  wanna be
B	why?
C	Cos I just think ecologically it's more of a sustainable way of eating
B	fair enough
A	mm
C	you sound quite you look quite upset my that Pete
B	I'm not upset
C	it's just I er just it's just a standard food chain argument of if we wanted to feed everyone it would we could feed them much more efficiently if we
C	didn't raise crops on huge areas of land
C	balanced crops instead
A	mm
B	or alternatively if we want to feed everyone we should just use bloody GM and stop whinging about it
C	no I also agree with that
C	I do agree with that
B	er that's something that really fucks me off when you get these very sort of very middle class anti GM people and oh
A	yeah
B	yes you can afford
A	you yeah
B	food can't you
C	yeah
B	so get out of the way
C	no  no I agree  I agree completely
B	mm
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	who's having a go at GM it's yep
B	ah
C	but I think you'll find that third world countries don't generally object to GM
A	mm
C	it's generally middle class people in in
B	yeah
C	no that's not to say that isn't a real thing though
B	no indeed but it's it's very mm
A	hmm
B	not
C	mm
B	yeah
C	and it should be taken seriously
B	mm
C	yeah
A	but yeah on on
C	mm
B	mm
A	crops that have had any chemicals or
B	because
A	yeah
B	I mean I don't understand how stupid these people are
B	genetically modified in some way shape or form
C	yeah cos it's been selectively bred
A	yeah
B	exactly
B	sorry
A	oh
B	yep
A	with the Waitrose set
B	but it's interesting actually
C	waitrose is a good good supermarket though
A	I've never shopped there
B	I don't it's good for some things
C	one of my housemates occasionally goes
A	okay
C	but it's really good
A	yeah?
B	it's not good for fruit and veg I've found
C	mm
B	like for fresh produce it's not very good
C	it's good  it's good  for red meat
A	oh okay
C	they have really good steaks and burgers and stuff
A	mm
B	mm
C	their burgers are really really nice
B	oh yeah actually my mum gets those
C	right
B	really
A	they're
C	we er  we er  we kind of
C	burgers
A	mm
C	and we did Co-op nice burgers
B	I could've predicted that possibly
C	but the Co-op were nicer than the Tesco
A	okay
C	which was interesting
A	mm
B	you can
A	you get steak and chips and
C	what what for ten pounds sorry?
A	er two dine for ten pounds
C	oh is that in their
C	take out meal thing
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	so you get like a main course a side dish a dessert and a bottle of wine
C	right
A	for ten quid
C	oh that's good
A	which is really good
B	steak chips nice bottle of wine
C	the bottle of wine makes it
A	yeah
C	quite a nice deal
B	well the wine's normally six quid by itself
C	mm
A	if you don't drink wine it's not so good
C	mm
A	so
B	mm
B	Don't know if I ever listen to it
C	I think it was the only full album you had on that iPod I think
B	that's really not true
C	no the only full Stereophonics album
B	oh yeah yeah
C	not like but
C	also there aren't very many
A	I snuck this on you
C	full albums on there
A	I
C	Cos I went through all the um I went on er the artists thing and I went in all the artists that I really like and there's generally like one song in there
C	rather than an album
B	I've got quite a lot of compilation albums
C	mm
B	um
C	right
A	mm
B	brilliant work-out music
A	hmm
B	that's quite good driving music if you're tired
B	it's really good music though
A	mm
B	as in er it's not just screaming white noise
A	yeah
B	well the lyrics for example
A	yeah
B	do kind of make sense
A	if that's the best you can say
B	well no as in a lot of metal's just random shite
B	I mean if you listen to Rage Against the Machine it's just nonsense what they're saying
C	no I disagree with that
A	I've never listened to enough of it to make a judgement
B	er
A	I've only really heard
C	I don't agree with their politics but er I think there's a
B	to
C	no they're not really
B	to quote from  But the
C	they're a bit more sophisticated than that
B	I'm not well it's I only have one of their songs in all fairness
B	which is
C	at least there
A	yeah
C	like it's just
A	I know what you mean
C	it's just generic and
A	it doesn't mean anything
C	boring
B	yep
A	yeah
B	this is a sign of aging
C	I know
A	I'm getting into my folk music
C	it's the
A	yeah
C	and then Radio 4
A	oh
C	a few years ago for me
A	yeah
B	you see that happened to me about
C	mm
B	simultaneously with puberty
C	mm
A	when you stopped going to school discos you discovered Radio 4
B	er well yeah I
B	never actually went through puberty
C	the thing is like
C	um
B	oh
C	we sort of grew up in the nineties
A	yeah
C	but I was still too young in the early nineties to appreciate the music at the time
A	yeah
C	and that is the music now
A	we were around but
C	that I
A	mm
B	what is grunge?
C	it's like the music that came out of Seattle in the nineties
B	oh Nirvana
C	pearl Jam
B	okay
C	and people like Silverchair and well Pearl Jam are still going as well
A	mm
B	I I literally know Nirvana out of that lot
C	right
B	but okay
C	but that is just my sort of I just  I just  love it
A	yeah
C	like like there isn't anything else now
A	yeah
C	it's just it just kind of suits me so well
A	mm
B	you see I still enjoy
A	you'll listen to anything
B	sorry?
A	you'll listen to anything
B	yeah
B	and like I will um my iPod is varied if nothing else
C	mm
B	um
B	pretty hardcore
A	oh yeah
B	death metal
A	bit of Hilary Duff
B	whose first album was brilliant
A	er all of Hilary Duff is gobshite
B	no the first album's pretty good
C	who the hell's Hilary Duff?
B	she's a she she was
A	she's God awful
B	a sort of American pop sorry a teenage sort of a bit like
A	I hate everything she stands for
B	so a bit like
C	what does she stand for sorry?
A	she's blonde
B	so she
A	and American and thirteen and
B	so she's a bit like um sort Lindsay Lohan
C	oh right
B	not she's a sort of
A	she's Selina Gomez and all that
C	right
A	oh no she was um
B	but she started a career as a singer
C	right
B	then did a few films
A	no she  no she  did um what was that TV programme called? It was on CBB
C	hang on
B	yeah
C	I'd like I'm not sure what I'd like to listen to but I'm interested to know
B	well there were one or two
B	very good songs on it
B	um but the second album's
B	completely different and awful
C	well
A	what was the programme called? Lizzie McGuire
C	right
A	um and you know like Disney Channel type thing
C	mm
A	then she became a singer
B	no she was a singer first
A	she wasn't
B	hey
A	hmm?
B	to my knowledge she hasn't got any massive well not that I would know about this but it's never
A	she's vile
B	been sort of publicized as having some massive drug habits or
A	she's vile
A	she's just
C	she'd seem more genuine then?
A	yeah
A	she you know she I just you know
B	so by vile you mean she's
C	all the best singers eventually develop drug habits
A	yeah
B	oh
C	it is true though
A	I'd respect her more as an artist
C	it is true
A	it is true
B	it's not
A	he's not one of the best
C	oh dear
B	he's according to most of the
A	God
B	anything by him
C	oh dear
A	Don't
B	you've got a
C	aggressively what?
A	yeah but he's Cliff Richard
C	most aggressively what?
B	clean-living person on the planet
C	oh yeah but he's still like put botox in his face
C	that's not particularly clean
B	hmm
C	well maybe it is
B	uh
C	probably kills bacteria
C	I think I feel I should
B	and and sells
C	I feel I need to educate you on um the nineties grunge movement now
B	Good
A	this second
B	in general okay I don't object to that
C	have you not really not heard of Pearl Jam? Or Alice in Chains?
B	no
C	mm
A	my uncle's going to see Pearl Jam
B	have you got any CDs? I'll take them
C	are they?
A	yeah
C	what when?
A	I can't remember
C	mm
A	er cos he was upset because he wanted to go and see Bruce Springsteen but it was on the same night as
C	oh right

A	yeah
C	a big band
B	first large-scale live music I've ever have seen
A	it'll be the largest scale music I've ever seen

A	folk artists don't generally play Knebworth
B	odd that
A	sonisphere?
B	er Sonisphere
C	yeah
A	I was gonna say
C	yep
A	but I'm not sure
C	I agree

C	mm
A	you really don't wanna go to an Evanescence gig

B	actually no
A	yeah
C	I'm going to see um not music but I'm go I'm going to comedy now
A	mm
C	at um the dunno is it the
A	ah
C	in May
A	I'm really I need to ring up again and see if they've got any more returns
C	mm
A	mm
C	because like no offence or
A	mm
C	most female comedians are crap
A	oh yeah
C	but she's actually good
A	she's really good
B	mm
A	hmm
B	sympathy

A	no no Tim Minchin as in I think he's a genius
B	yeah
B	he's not necessarily
C	no I do like him
B	but he's so clever
A	he actually says sensible things a lot of the time
B	mm
C	mm
A	oh
C	I'm looking forward to seeing Paul Merton
A	mm
C	I really like his er sense of surreal humour
C	but I can't imagine him doing stand-up
A	I was gonna say like er cos um
C	he's usually in like Have I Got News For You
A	mm
C	and like very little else
B	mm
A	yeah
C	or presenting TV shows
C	just about random things
A	so yeah there's the silent cinema one he did was really good
C	yeah he's
A	yeah
B	mm
C	no I'm not  I'm not
B	he's just just
C	Frankie Boyle's biggest fan
A	no
B	I think he can be very good
C	yeah
A	but yeah it's
C	yeah
A	it's more kind of oh that comment was quite funny
B	no it's it's just painful
C	it's deliberate well er deliberately er like obscene
A	mm
C	which is I dunno
A	I can see what he's doing but
B	he's
C	I don't really appreciate him

C	you think you would?
B	yeah
C	I love it
A	mm
C	like it cos some
A	that sounds really good

C	but actually quite good
C	and you just start laughing
B	you see that's the sort of comedy I like
C	yeah
B	you're forced to
C	mm
B	but was never actually sort of cos I was sort of surprised about seeing one stand-up comedian who was bizarrely it was on um you remember GCSE English verse and anthology?
C	yeah
B	well one of the writer

C	yeah
B	the laughing would stop
B	oh who was this guy that we went to see who was
B	we went in second year
A	Dylan Moran
B	Dylan Moran
A	I think that's his act
B	yeah
A	I've paid twenty-five quid and you haven't even
B	he
A	bothered to come up with some jokes
B	and he'd give the occasional chuckle but
A	he annoyed me a bit
B	no I don't wanna pay good money to be gently
C	I went
B	amused
C	I went to see um
C	do you know  do you know
B	yes
C	you know who he is right?
B	I think so
C	yeah
A	I don't think I do but
B	fairly big

C	um
B	okay
C	like me
C	half at CERN half at at
A	oh yeah
B	right
C	um
A	okay
C	at
A	mm
C	and it was a comedy night specifically for um er
A	nice
C	all the comedians were like amateurs
A	yeah
B	mm
C	apart from the one guy who was like the the MC
A	oh right
C	I can't remember what his name was
A	oh right
C	as I say I've heard of him now but I hadn't before
C	and they had
C	jokes and stuff
A	yeah
C	it was very very funny
A	did you have to be quite into your science? Or was it just funny?
C	well it er helped if you knew a little bit about science
A	mm
C	but it wasn't it was all kind of aimed at the layman anyway so it was
A	yeah yeah
C	you got a bit more of it some of the jokes um
A	hmm
C	but most it was most like
A	right
C	it was like why particle physics is like sex
C	for like half an hour
A	nice
C	that's essentially all he talked about
C	but it was really good
A	it sounds good
C	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	hmm
C	I am sure
C	none of us would find that very funny though
B	no you
C	you might find it that funny
B	yeah
A	that's a  that's a  bit more
B	there's a very select
A	specialized
C	quite niche niche
A	yeah
B	target audience
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	oh huh
A	mm
B	yeah I didn't think you were gonna get through that
B	see I've got a clean plate
A	you licked yours
C	I might finish
A	yes er does any if anyone actually wants some pasta like
C	I might have this as well
A	do you  do you  want the pasta?
C	yeah
A	you er do you want?
C	I'll finish your I'll finish yours
A	yeah yeah
C	off if you're not gonna finish it
A	I'm full
C	thank you
A	we have got
C	I hope you don't  I hope you don't  find that rude
A	no no it's it was it would've gone in the bins
C	er I just tend to finish
A	so yeah just
C	I just tend to finish other people's food if they don't finish it that's all
A	go for it
B	um
C	mm
C	I didn't say that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	thinking
A	could've been dreadful
C	even if it wasn't you know I probably would've eaten it
C	but it is
A	mm
B	er something else
A	what do you want?
B	everwood soundtrack?
A	ah
B	that's got Stereophonics on it
A	it hasn't
C	what did you say to put on?
B	it has got
A	it hasn't
B	is it Travis?
A	Travis are on it
B	I thought they were
A	oh yes it has
C	to what?
A	sorry it
B	thank you
A	what do they sing? Oh First Time Ever I Saw oh I hate that song
C	soundtrack to what?
B	everwood
A	it's not really comedy drama
B	it's very funny
A	it's funny but it's not really a comedy drama
B	it's er it's a drama series
A	mm
B	it the central characters are a very um sort of world-leading brain surgeon who is a workaholic in New York until his wife dies
A	she no she's younger than that
B	well er
A	anyway
B	out to
A	she's er a young girl
B	this small town in Colorado where he sets up a free medical practice
C	mm
B	and er it's their adventures or misadventures
C	mm
A	it's um it's er it's really good
B	mm
A	all a bit kind of grief-stricken
B	I thought you said hates hits sorry
A	no no
B	rather than hate
A	so he he hates his dad and it's it's all quite um quite good
B	but it's not as cheesy as you make it sound
A	no
B	it's actually very good
A	but it's really good
C	okay
B	um and it's really good cos they always have like every episode has a subplot which is a medical dilemma but and it's got to deal with like an ethical thing
C	mm
B	er so there's you know a very obvious one on abortion which was fascinating
A	it's like Casualty but good
C	right
B	er but it's really interesting cos they never actually come down on a side
C	mm
B	it's like what is the right thing to do here?
C	mm
B	um
C	mm
A	it's very gentle and nice but also
B	it's not
A	no as in it's it's kind of fun to watch
C	mm
A	like it's not harrowing and horrible
B	some of it is
A	some of it is
B	mm
C	the most harrowing and horrible TV show
A	er the yeah
C	ever devised by man
A	oh it's excellent
B	the most attractive man on God's earth
A	yeah
C	I've seen it once in Pete's room when I was in er
C	my second year or third year or something
C	must've been third year
B	mm
A	we sort of bought it as a bit of a joke
C	he didn't buy it he's er he doesn't look like he bought it as a joke
B	no no I just because
A	well
B	we were curious
A	yeah we we go oh look it's Richard off Friends
B	it was eight pounds in Smiths
C	mm
B	and we were on holiday and thought well it will give us something to watch
C	right
B	but it's
B	but it's got Magnum in it
A	who's just amazing
C	was he the guy with the moustache right?
A	yeah
B	he's the only man I've ever met who's got better legs than I have
B	sorry I've seen
B	um
A	oh that would be good
C	I've got better legs than you have
B	oh no
C	far better
A	oh dear
C	A leg off
A	does sound
A	I think it will be pretty bad
A	you lot getting tape measures out
A	look
A	it's not
A	it's it's not gonna make for a good evening really
C	and it's being recorded
A	yeah
A	I think you should settle this and agree that you've both got equally excellent legs
B	I don't think we'll ever agree that
C	I think we'll just
A	no
C	we'll just have to agree to settle it at some other point
A	fair enough
C	we need like an an an a um impartial third party
C	to er to judge it as well
A	I'm not sure
B	no
A	he'd probably object to that
B	particularly the last bit of my legs
C	as soon as you come to the door
C	you've gotta
C	you've gotta tell us what you think about these legs
A	you two standing with no trousers on
C	I think he might run away
A	yeah
B	that's er that's quite funny
A	in all fair that's what you did to get try and get rid of um
B	no
C	to who?
B	um
C	oh
B	yes
C	really?
B	well we were trying to have quite a private conversation
C	yeah
B	and
C	mm
B	and you couldn't you know we were  we were  trying to hint um yeah actually we're chatting here and
C	mm
B	and er we just got to right okay we'll go back to your well
B	would not leave us alone
C	right
B	so we ended up saying yeah we're going back to have sex now
C	oh God
A	poor
C	so you he probably thought you were actually gonna have sex
A	mm
C	he just probably did just didn't get it at all
A	yeah
A	think so yeah
A	mean to him
B	yeah he didn't believe us until we were down to boxers
B	did leave
A	and then you put your clothes back on
C	what is he  what is he  doing now? Do you know?
B	no but that no that's when we continued our conversation in the buff
A	he's doing a PhD
C	is he?
B	he spent a year
B	yeah
C	right
B	I don't think he sort of got on with it and
C	right
B	came back to do a PhD
C	in where? Where is he?
C	oh
A	well we met him in John Lewis
B	we did
A	quite random
B	did invite him to dinner
A	didn't come
B	er actually no we invited him to that party
B	you were in Australia
B	yeah
A	he'd wrecked his
C	was it a house-warming party?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	right
B	I'm inclined to believe that
B	Cos he did seem really keen
C	oh he would've come
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	it was a very good night actually
C	mm
B	mm
C	yeah

C	oh
C	I thought you said fat
A	she's really large
A	that's mean
C	is she  is she  a Buddhist like he is?
B	I don't think so
A	he actually didn't seem that Buddhist
B	so he came and he got pissed
A	when he was here

B	like he's I can't imagine like ever being upset with him for about anything
C	yeah
C	he's just the most mellow character
C	in the world isn't he
A	he was very mellow
C	is he working for like
B	no

C	mm
A	but after that she was fine
C	what was she called?

A	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's it
B	oh we tried we
B	went in to park in town today
A	such a uh
B	such a fucking
C	mm
B	all the students coming down
C	going home?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it was just full of parents
B	so there was
C	yeah
B	nowhere to park
A	and we got so held up going in
B	then got to
C	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	it's that weekend isn't it
A	yeah
C	mind you this time last year I think I
A	yeah
C	well I went home for a weekend I think but
A	yes
C	that actually wasn't a bad Easter
A	mm
C	revising the whole time
A	mm
C	quite relaxing somehow
A	yeah
C	and the weather was even though the weather like normally you think if the weather's great
A	mm
C	you don't wanna be revising
A	I quite like it
C	no one else was there anyway
A	yeah
C	so you couldn't exactly like play football with anyone
A	yeah yeah
C	Cos there was no one to play football with so
A	so you
C	yeah I was in the library
A	weather to go for a walk
C	and it was nice to look out and see the sunshine
A	yeah
C	so it was actually alright
A	quite like that
C	but we had a really hot April last year
B	mhm
C	it was like ludicrously hot
A	yeah it was this year
B	oh I'm looking forward to the summer
A	and then it was cold the rest of the summer
C	yeah it was horrible
B	when
C	to be stuck in a library for
B	yeah
C	right
B	er
C	I think er probably not
B	no
C	right
B	and then a solo one next year
C	you haven't told me about that
B	er well yes that that was the aim
B	er
C	mm
B	I think
C	mm
B	but um the point being it's still one of my training goals
C	who's the other person?
B	um
C	no don't know who he is
B	er if you met him you'd remember
C	mm
B	um
C	right
B	yeah
C	right
B	um
C	mm
B	um
A	in what sense?
B	well for example he's pissed against the outside wall of the bar
A	yep
B	um
A	so did you have a night out with him and you remember it
B	I don't think through a window
B	oh no sorry it was the it was the flower bed under a staircase
B	just between there and the bar
A	nice
B	he's the only person I've ever known who's taken a leak inside
C	there must be others though
A	oh there would've been others
C	yeah
A	probably fellows
C	yeah lecturers have done that
A	lecturers have done that
A	I can see that happening
B	he's got a  he's got a  room in A so you know
B	yeah
A	has he?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	study
A	okay
B	um
A	actually no but
B	actually no
B	staircase
C	yeah
B	the funny thing was he was
A	depends how pissed you are
B	probably pissing against the outside wall of a toilet
B	he could've just walked
A	God
C	must've been desperate
A	what can you do?
B	he must've been hammered
C	mm
A	yeah
B	um
C	well unfortunately I won't be here this summer so I won't can't er can't volunteer to do your cross channel craziness
A	and you're not mental so yeah
B	sure you don't?
C	I'm not mental either
C	I can swim but I don't swim really so
B	sure you don't feel like it?
C	not really
A	fair enough
B	it's a great
C	I don't know that's for you we we me and you have very different definitions of strength
B	well as in er you're using pretty much all of your body's muscles for a long time
C	but I
A	mm
B	one helps the other
C	yeah you do get  you do get  some from but the most effective way to get stronger is to lift heavier weights
B	I think a lot of people would
C	the definition of strength is how much you can lift
B	I think er
A	yeah it it depends how you define it exactly yeah
B	in all fairness though er
C	but sprint trainers always do heavy weights
B	mm
C	sprinters do have very strong legs I admit
B	but er
C	definitely
B	er yeah
A	yeah
B	does come it's not all from the weights
C	but that's more power rather than strength
B	subtle distinction
B	but alright
C	no there is a  there is a  distinction though
A	mm
C	Cos power is effectively how fast you can lift the weight
A	hmm
C	er it's that is how it's manifested really
B	okay
B	um
C	and that's why power lifting is
A	yeah
C	not about how fast you can lift the weight
B	um
A	interesting
B	mm
C	but yeah
C	sprinters do a lot of weight training cos it's good for sprinting
A	mm
C	A lot of power-related sprinter training as well like fast explosive
B	mhm
C	sort of er squats and things
A	yeah
B	um
C	yeah I don't really swim very much though
A	huh
C	I can swim about last time I went swimming I did about  I did about  one or two lengths and I was completely exhausted
A	swimming's really knackering
C	like I'm not unfit you know
C	I can play football and I can run reasonable reasonable distances
A	shall I er
B	okay
B	um
C	but good luck with
A	thank you
C	your er thank you
C	attempt
B	mm
C	it's quite adventurous that
B	well yeah er it I love swimming in open water and I'm pretty resistant to cold
C	yeah
B	so between the two it's seemed like quite
C	are you gonna grease yourself up for it?
B	there's two schools of thought on that
C	are you gonna wear like a huge
B	no no you can't
C	really?
B	um
B	er apparently one of the main advantages is protection from jellyfish stings
C	oh really?
B	yeah
C	oh that's interesting
B	well it's the initial thermal shock and then the jellyfish protection
C	yeah
B	so I'm pretty
B	mm
A	yeah
C	interesting
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	however
C	what are these things?
B	minions
B	you haven't seen the film Despicable Me have you?
C	I don't think so
B	er
C	despicable Me?
B	yeah
C	is it a Pixar film?
C	it might be Dreamworks then or something
A	it's I think it's Dreamworks
C	right
B	brilliant film
C	right
B	um it well it's actually it's er it's  a children's film in principle um but it's brilliant
B	this super-villain Gru
C	right
B	hence the G
C	okay
B	um
A	he tries not to be likeable at the beginning
B	and he's trying to he's being a bit old and a bit past it and there's this sort of younger villain called um
C	oh hang on
A	called Vector
B	called Vector
C	I have seen it
B	attitude and direction
C	is he  is he
B	no
A	no he's
B	that no that's Megamind
A	oh that's Megamind
C	oh I mean er Megamind
A	it's kind of similar
C	it's the same it sounds the same like
B	it's
C	a villain who's not really a villain
B	er yeah
A	yeah
B	it's a very similar concept only
C	Megamind's quite funny
A	Megamind's good
B	yeah this is subtly better
C	right
B	er
C	no I haven't definitely haven't seen this then
B	okay um tut what I suggest is if I go and print the maps out and work out where the hell we're actually going tomorrow
B	I'm just gonna pack kit in the morning since we've got a bit more time now
A	yeah
B	well rucksack
A	yeah but as in it's not gonna take hours to pack
C	it's just lunch right? Isn't it? And
A	oh yeah I'll make lunch tonight I think
B	um
C	that's fine
B	I'll also ring
A	you could put
B	yeah indeed
A	with his dating er
B	well I also need the details for this walk
A	oh yeah
B	so er
C	oh I saw something printed out
B	yeah
C	okay
B	er a while ago
C	yeah
B	er I called him while I was in you know but it's non-stop so they'll complete it in about sixteen hours
C	yeah
B	um it's a charity thing
C	right
B	well they could to to be fair but
B	they're not
C	mm
B	er which should be fun
C	me and um
B	oh yes
C	did I tell you about it? It's like a twelve um
B	the website's bizarre
C	it's a twelve mile endurance course with obstacles and er
B	you? Endurance?
C	on fire and yeah I can run
C	I love endurance
C	it's not just just er running it's you know carry they make you carry logs and stuff as well
C	and er climb over big tall things and get electrocuted
A	sounds quite manly
C	yeah
B	you know it's er essentially that's what all my training focus is on
C	yeah
B	um as in it was sort of er initially focused around army endurance and just
C	I love
C	twice
B	that's not endurance
A	oh
C	that is endurance
A	that made a really cool noise
B	um
C	no I don't think they say that
B	I think it it well no I think um yeah you have to have a very you need to be a good marathon runner you need like like if you lined up a load of runners I could spot the marathon runners
B	no upper body strength
B	basically you need to be as light as possible
A	oh you can put that on the hob if you want
B	but um I dunno it's just like some of the obstacles like running through an electrified field
C	yeah
C	why not?
B	like er like some of the things are just like if they just took like a military assault course fine
C	so why are you er why aren't you keen to have it inflicted on you for no good reason?
B	well no there has to be a good reason for it though
A	you're willing to put up with pain
B	ooh it's
C	I think it's quite fun
A	oh
A	oh it's
C	er do we need to load this
A	um it's loaded
C	okay
A	um you can dry maybe if you  if you  want
C	yeah
A	er
C	where's the dryer?
A	tea towel on there
C	should I move the dirties over to that side?
A	um I'm yeah
A	um
A	cool
B	oh huh
E	it was alright
A	they've been rowing in er
C	oh has he?
A	he has
C	that's the one in London right? Thames?
A	yeah yeah
E	during our race
A	um yeah
C	did
A	yeah
C	just cos
C	just funny
A	yeah
C	couldn't
A	well his dad's retired and sort of looking for jobs
C	sorry?
A	er
E	oh you had fish?
C	yeah
E	ugh
C	Don't you like fish
E	ugh
A	anchovies
E	smell to walk into
A	anchovies and tuna
E	no
A	really good
E	no
A	it's a good job you weren't here
E	not my favourite food
A	aw
E	instead
A	oh well
E	it was very nice
C	how are you doing?
E	alright
C	Good
E	finally er got my hands on some actual design
C	oh excellent
E	er it's nothing um spectacular
C	right
E	to er
A	mm
E	so this is a pumping station
C	yeah
E	site
C	yeah
E	each with two pumps in
E	between kiosks
E	one has to go underneath the access road
A	so
E	fucking big thing though
C	what the whole the the cavity itself?
E	the
C	oh the trough?
E	yeah
C	yeah
E	the whole
C	oh right
E	um
A	so did you get it wrong with the
E	yes
C	get it right
A	yeah
E	no but
A	fall into the trough
E	the
E	and er yeah
A	excellent
E	um
A	in a road
E	not that many weeks' time I guess
A	mm
E	well it's almost that
E	it's so tight
A	oh right
E	um
A	so they've got
E	they're trying to get it done A S A F P
C	yeah
E	um
A	oh
E	it's kind of er a bit construction's happening in parallel with design
E	and er they're
E	using us
E	as
C	mm
E	it's not that terrible
C	well it's er it's good in that you can sort of feed back things that need to be done like instantly
E	yeah
C	you might otherwise have kind of finalized design and you'd never have thought of it until you started building it
E	yeah
C	but
E	um
C	it's not often that you have a situation where
C	design can't be finalized properly
E	mm
E	we we design the pipework and send that to the the pipework fabrication subcontractor
C	right
E	who then develops as build drawings about how they plan to make it
C	yeah
E	instead of necessarily taking different sections and
C	yeah
E	bolting them together
C	yeah
E	or whatever
A	um
E	for example
A	ah
E	reasonably interesting
C	yeah
C	yeah I've
E	mm
C	and the company's finally decided they want to stump up for this bit of kit
E	mm
C	which would kind of validate my research
E	oh excellent
C	er so if we get this bit of kit we can do lots of
E	mm
C	and um but you can't test if my theory's correct if
C	um does
C	does er does its safety features
A	nice
C	so we bought a VW Polo
C	and it's a really good one
E	yeah
C	well a proper boy racer car
C	and we've just I've just been like taking it apart and like logging loads of data
A	cool
C	um plotting it in MATLAB and doing analysis and stuff like that
E	sounds pretty awesome
C	it's quite basic stuff
E	mm
C	much about mechanical stuff before that
E	you actually get to take stuff apart and play with
C	yeah
E	play with gadgets
C	and my other project which is starting on Monday is a European funded project to do with thermo-electric generators
E	mm
C	like EU funded thing to work out if it's worthwhile putting these generators on the tail-pipes of trucks like exhaust-pipes
E	mm
C	electrical solid state type thing between a hot source which is the exhaust gas and a cold source which is the engine coolant
E	right
C	um and we're like a subcontractor for one of the main people
E	is the engine sort of really the coolest thing?
C	well it it is a reservoir
E	oh okay
C	I mean the only other thing you could use is air
E	yeah
C	but it's not like easy enough to transfer to
E	right
C	it'll be typically be ninety degrees
E	oh right
C	there's enough of a differential to use the engine cooler as yeah
E	right
C	as the cold source
E	yeah
C	yeah
E	mm
C	have you been in London today?
E	sorry?
C	have you been in London today?
E	yeah
C	how did it go? Were you rowing?
E	yeah
C	who for?
E	Cantabs
C	what's that? Is that like graduates or something?
C	right
E	um
C	yeah
E	you know the last boathouse you pass before you get to
C	right
E	um that's it
C	oh okay
E	so it's way it's the furthest out
C	yeah
E	I didn't find out because I only I got the e-mail from the Cantabs people about our results but I don't know about er Selwyn
C	hmm
E	and I think Cantabs M2 and Selwyn M2 might be interesting to compare
C	are you in different divisions then?
E	we're in different categories
C	right
E	um
C	mm
E	Cantabs M2 is in IM2
C	is that intermediate men or something?
E	yeah
C	right
E	um
C	it's quite a funny thing the Selwyn
E	um and then
C	Selwyn M2 are novice
E	Selwyn M1 and Cantabs M1
C	yeah
E	are also in different categories
C	Selwyn M1
E	mm?
C	what's Selwyn M1? Are they in the novice category as well?
E	I dunno
A	wuh
E	Selwyn
C	what are they in? What
E	what are they in?
C	yeah
E	oh er can't remember which category
C	oh right
E	I think  I think  Cantabs M1 might be a um
E	something above IM
C	right
E	something else
C	mm
E	so
A	hmm
C	out of?
E	four hundred and four
A	mm
C	that's very good
A	pretty good
C	is that your division then? Or just everyone?
E	everyone
C	okay
E	it takes a fucking long time
C	yeah
E	so er at the start yeah so they're seeded and so everybody goes in order of their expected um roughly expected result
C	mm
E	so Leander one goes past
C	who's Leander one?
E	er well first boat of Leander which is one of the  one of the  boat clubs on the Thames
C	right
E	and Leander is generally accepted as the best in the country
C	okay
E	molesey is another one
C	oh right
A	nice
E	in three
C	what the Czechs?
E	a few different European clubs
C	oh right
E	um
C	right
E	Cos they've got they don't they wouldn't waste their time
C	yeah
E	I don't know
C	mm
E	Don't know
C	yeah
A	so you could probably find out
E	just it's just backwards
C	right
E	and obviously not on the same day
A	should've asked
C	um
C	I'm alright I think for now
A	do you wanna drink
E	um
C	Peter's gonna open his whisky soon anyway
E	I'll avoid whisky
E	er
A	there's beer
E	um
E	I'm er I'm leaning more towards beer
A	yeah
E	guessing I know where to find it
E	I'm alright
A	ooh
E	mhm
A	ah
E	I er met up with
A	was it good?
E	nice
A	have a nice chat?
E	yeah
A	I've got a plaster
E	or something
A	dettol? Antiseptic wash
A	probably
E	dettol sounds like what you
A	oh yeah
E	ready to use skin wound spray
A	yeah
E	yeah right
A	it's it's um
E	okay for broken skin as well?
A	I think it I think it's just the same as um
E	got myself a nice blister
A	savlon
E	as you can see
A	yeah
E	but er it appeared and then ripped and it was
A	uh
E	quite agonizing
E	but um er yeah
A	nasty
E	got a plaster?
A	yes I have
E	well no not really
A	oh
E	um yeah
C	what have you done?
E	got myself a massive blister
C	oh nice
E	I think it's got bits of Thames in it
C	oh no
A	oh
E	yeah
A	what's that?
C	is that worse than
E	Weil's disease
C	I was gonna say is that worse than Weil's disease
E	it's the same thing
A	oh right
E	Cos if anything is certain it's certain that rats have pissed in the Thames
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	can I play with your iPad?
A	yeah
C	yeah
E	although to my body's credit it also seem
A	there you go
E	seems to have already re-grafted the skin slightly
C	right
A	nice
E	where the blister
C	that's pretty good going
E	opened up
A	is it clean? That'll do
C	hmm
A	still have the inclination to do
C	this is his fourth year project?
A	the um book in the er um iBooks or whatever it's called is from his fourth year project
E	oh yeah
C	you can tell this is a
A	yeah
C	a book for electrical engineers
C	just says an inverter is just a big box of electronics
A	nice
C	no
A	nice
C	there's so much to it
E	I don't even know what the inverter does
C	there's so much to it
C	it's not just anything
A	excellent
E	what does an inverter do?
C	DC to AC
E	oh okay
C	it's the opposite of rectifier
E	uh-huh
C	let's see
E	I know you can er you can achieve a really crude um AC to DC with a few diodes and a capacitor
C	yeah
E	or two
C	that's a simple
E	is that basically it?
C	a simple rectifier
E	mm
C	it's for like what you use to
C	what you use to power motors and things
E	it was nice er having the door opened to me
A	oh yes
E	unlike last year last
C	did that not happen last time?
E	no
A	mm
E	last time
C	quizzed?
A	you can't give us an enigma and then not answer
E	mm
E	I did
A	did eventually let you in
A	yeah
A	ah
E	in fact I'm er oh must of er finished about twenty-five minutes ago
A	finished
E	last the last um ooh
E	oh is that
A	yeah
E	oh hello
E	yes
A	oh
C	yeah you've been recorded
A	yeah
C	since the moment you walked in
A	that's fine
C	you'll be  you'll be  known as
E	this is the third time
C	you'll be known  you'll be known  as number four on this transcript
E	what?
A	we
E	oh
A	number the speakers based on the order they speak in
E	okay
A	er that's how it works
E	mm
A	I can't be bothered to go to bed
E	um
A	get the tuna off the
E	hope I er hope I get a text tomorrow
A	any text?
E	about er
E	about the um
A	ah
E	situation
E	otherwise it it is just a an elaborate ruse to let me down gently
A	oh
E	hmm?
A	when does she find out or does she not know?
E	I don't know
A	okay
E	but I mean she was gonna go home this weekend
A	right
E	so
A	gone home or isn't
E	well
A	going home
E	no
A	okay
E	the get up
A	oh so she might be going home tomorrow?
E	yeah
A	but might not be
E	yeah
A	she'll
A	bless
E	my mind gets
A	uh
E	ever more pessimistic as
A	uh
E	as time wears on
A	oh
E	just a standard theme for me
A	aw
C	what gets pessimistic?
E	my mind
C	your mind?
E	yeah
C	right
E	um
C	oh yes
E	and she was  she was  gonna go home this weekend
E	if that works
E	we've got a date this week
A	so you're on tenterhooks
E	yes
A	aw
C	well good luck with that
C	what's she called?
C	how do you know her?
E	um
C	oh right
E	um
E	in um our third year
A	er how do  how do  you mean monstrosity?
E	it was well I dunno
E	huh
A	there
E	the you could  you could  see what he was trying to do and er there there was something possibly good in that approach but it could have done with rewriting it entirely
C	can I have a hand?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	oh my knees
E	and then er on Sunday I just randomly bumped into her er in the street
A	have you?
E	we had ice cream because it was sunny
C	very good
E	was doing a play this week
C	awesome
E	and I went to see it on Wednesday
C	where's it being performed?
E	it's quite abstract
C	right
E	mm
E	an app?
C	I'm gonna see what it is
C	mm
E	such a Volvo addict
E	er yeah
C	fruit Ninja? What's that mean?
E	oh
C	no I don't think I have
E	oh it's a game you can get on Smartphones and so on
C	ooh
E	and iPads
E	um
E	it's addictive
E	yes
C	mm
E	it's just one of those silly and
C	yeah
E	games
C	right
E	I've never tried it
C	I find it really boring
E	mm
C	in fact to be honest like I find most games on phones really boring
E	oh dear
C	I wonder if we got er wonder what we've gotta do on this game
C	play
E	yeah
C	quite a long way
E	wahey
C	ah there's a bit of a knack to this
E	do you have to flick it? Can you yeah
C	yeah
B	uh
B	Good shooting
C	I dunno
E	twenty-nine
C	I find it quite weird the way you've gotta do it
B	yeah
E	er
C	oh
E	oh
B	yeah
E	he started playing it thirty seconds ago
C	yeah
B	no
C	okay
B	um yeah
C	right
B	where the car's gonna be parked all day
C	well hopefully not
B	um
C	I got it all in one last time
B	yeah
B	I take  I take  it
C	no
B	mm
E	mm
C	I don't
B	thank God for that
C	have you got Facebook on here?
B	not an app
E	no
C	have you got the internet?
B	no you're not actually
C	why? Will it log on to you?
B	yep
C	oh
B	yeah sure
C	er yes please
B	go on
C	okay
B	amongst other things
E	oh God
B	um so um
E	what's the booze cupboard looking like now? Oh
C	it's quite full
E	mm
B	no it's
E	oh there's a bit of space down the bottom though
B	exactly
C	do you know this guy
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	he lived next he lived on our corridor in when we were in fourth year
C	is he an engineer?
B	yeah
E	yeah
C	he's working at Ricardo
E	oh right
B	in his third year at the moment
C	right
E	oh yeah
C	there's a few people er
E	wouldn't he? Yeah
C	possibly
E	mm
B	oh right
C	including
B	um so what um yeah G and T? Er
C	er I really don't like gin
E	what?
C	not you
C	the
E	oh right
B	um yeah
B	mead
C	oh can I  can I  try some mead?
B	yep
C	oh
B	it's not very good mead this to be fair
C	oh right
B	that's why the bottle's almost full
E	still working on this
B	still working on that bad boy
E	what what um
B	oh you did miss the best weights session that I've had in a while earlier tonight
E	yeah
E	interest in sharing your weights session
C	well I did
E	well fair enough
C	well I don't well I mean I did share it
E	I know
B	um
C	the reason it was so good was because er  I I er  I told him what to do
B	in all fairness it worked out quite well
C	yeah it did  it did  work out quite well
B	Cos I don't think either of us did anything that we wouldn't have done otherwise
C	yeah
B	having a try of one of your sessions
C	yeah you're welcome to er
B	just for interest's sake
C	yeah you're welcome to come along some time
B	mm
E	what?
B	I set a new chin up PB
E	I only recently came across the
C	yeah
E	oh
B	I'm not sure that's an official distinction
C	I think you'll find it is
E	pull ups
C	yeah
E	or the other way around?
C	yeah
B	um
C	oh thank you
B	frankly you can have the entire bottle
C	how strong is it?
B	I think it's
C	mm
E	mm
B	I suspect you might not want that much but
E	ooh
B	for the love of God don't spill that
E	be careful
B	I would  I would  use your skin
E	careful of the sofa
B	to resurface the leather
C	I'm gonna  I'm gonna  look up chin ups and pull ups for you
B	um
C	hmm
B	right
E	now whose is this?
B	that's
E	yeah
B	what?
E	red wine
B	yeah
E	in the fridge
B	oh yeah
E	it's mine from formal
B	oh I think that's been donated now
C	yeah
E	I get the impression um Blue Fitness is missing
B	A few things
E	a
B	well it it doesn't have any free weights
C	is this the one we went to?
E	yeah the their insurance
B	no no
E	probably doesn't cover free weights
C	which one are you talking about?
B	er it's at the University Centre
E	I'm now a member there
B	it's a very nice gym
E	yeah
B	um
E	the only upper body stuff that it has are chest presses and those things
B	shoulder presses
E	sorry?
B	shoulder press
E	er alright
B	um
E	that's it
B	well it's got I suppose it's got no it's got it's um
E	well they've got that crazy hand pedal thing
B	oh I do love that
E	I've only tried it like
C	mm
E	once for a couple of minutes as a warm down
B	I do a five minute session
C	it's interesting
B	um
E	mm
B	but it's a little weird
C	which one?
B	er
B	do that
C	looks like boxing or something
E	no
C	mm
B	oh um yeah we've got one in the gym we were in um today
E	mm
B	actually
C	have you heard of this site called Fitocracy before?
E	yeah
B	no I don't er
C	have you heard of it?
E	I've heard of it
C	it's good
B	I don't tend to Google well I don't tend to use the internet in fitness
E	I know there was an XKCD comic about
C	yeah that's what I that's where I got it from
E	I think I've heard of it before that but
C	took me a long time to get an invite to it
B	an invite?
C	so it's like
E	yeah
C	it's kinda like
B	like Facebook?
C	sort of social media
B	right
C	but it's not really like Facebook
B	right
C	so every time you do a work-out or any form of exercise you log it
B	mm
C	um
B	mm
C	but you can track it on the website and then export it as a sort of CSV thing and then you can
B	oh right
C	so if I go on my profile and history and then like select an exercise
B	ah
E	mm
B	um
E	that's quite an amusing
B	mm
C	do you like that?
E	mm
C	it just randomly came to me some time
B	what is it?
E	probably an actual word
C	das Rumpsteak
E	mm
C	so like I look back at what I did this week
B	you see I've got one like this with the  with the
C	mm
B	which is quite weird
E	mm
C	oh dear
B	mm
C	yeah no I I understand that
E	mm
B	um anyway yes er bleurgh
C	yeah
B	so how do you get an invite?
C	um
E	mm
C	of tracking stuff really
B	ooh
E	mm
B	so there's only basically
E	it's er
B	two numbers I need to keep track of
C	but it's good if er if you do like weights and stuff
E	mm
C	yeah
E	mm
C	although I only know one other person that uses it
E	mm
C	two K test?
E	yep
C	as in a
E	yep
E	um
C	really?
B	er
E	they do them all in one day
C	right
E	and anyone can join  can join  You don't just have to be in the Oxford area
C	yeah
E	so er apparently Imperial won it one year
C	yeah
E	so we're gonna enter
C	mm
E	in there
E	um
B	can I ask you a question
E	yeah my
B	when you're free?
C	yeah
E	would be quite fun
B	you were racing today right?
E	yes
B	have you showered since?
E	um
B	can you please go and shower? As in I can smell you from here
E	okay
B	there's spare towels
E	there was choice about choice between getting a ridiculously late bus or
B	I've no objection to that
E	nope
B	right I'll get you a towel
E	do I smell of the Thames?
C	I've got a blocked nose
E	probably do
C	so I can't really smell anything
E	thank you
B	there's a towel
E	yep
B	uh
E	mm
C	er dunno
B	I plan on getting up about seven
C	that's quite early
B	it's quarter past eleven
E	in my experience of your getting up at the weekend times when you say you want to get up at seven you generally get up twelve
B	yes
C	we have to go  we have to go  and get me a gym
C	induction at nine
E	what?
C	me and
E	oh
C	in order to get me into the gym er we had to agree that I was gonna go for a
C	to cover the back of the lady who very nicely let me
C	yeah I thought we were leaving earlier as well
E	I thought we were leaving at seven thirty
B	that was the
C	yeah I thought we were as well
B	original idea
C	Cos we could still just do that
E	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
E	mm
C	because
B	no I don't wanna fuck her over
C	yeah
B	um and that means we can just make lunch in the morning and
E	mm
