C	I like the wrapping paper
F	we have one present under our tree so far

D	is like the screen actually curved round the side?
C	yeah
D	oh yeah does it make a difference?
C	not really
D	to your life?
C	I I I just think it looks quite nice
F	apparently they break easier because the screen is more vulnerable
C	okay
A	same with mine apparently
C	that makes sense but
A	like if I take the case off
D	I've dropped mine loads this year
F	so have I
C	I haven't dropped my phone yet

A	below your knee
D	yeah I know
A	oh okay
D	it made my like leg go tingly
C	he's just
D	I'm just whacking it
F	and Christmas gifts lots of Christmas gifts like
D	what does that do?
A	makes your hand go up like you know where your knuckle is so if you do that you know where your two knuckles are
D	yeah
A	if you go in in a with your last knuckle and go across to the middle where the your vein is if you whack there it should make your whole hand go
B	no but you're not doing it right
D	I'm I'm dead no
F	are those Pringles salt and vinegar Pringles? I'm like torture
D	yeah I got these I thought you liked the sour cream ones no you don't
B	I like the sour cream ones
D	god
F	I had porridge at like two o'clock
D	oh porridge
F	yeah well it's easy to eat right now
A	I bought this new thing called protein porridge nicest tasting thing ever it's it's good for you
D	I dislike the
A	no protein porridge
F	I have porridge with Nutella cos someone at uni ate my Nutella
A	I have that whey powder in there
C	I haven't had porridge in ages
F	and I haven't worked out who it is yet they ate like a kilo
A	who?
D	next time buy Nutella and put loads of laxatives in it and then you'll know who did it
F	no no because then I can't eat it someone at my flat
D	yeah but it's not there for you to eat it's there for you to punish the person who eats your food
B	yeah
A	yeah have your own thing just take it with it but pretend the one in there is the one you always eat
F	but I just cos it was a gift from my mother from France
D	how dare you eat my Nutella from France
F	it tastes different
D	does it? how does it?
F	yeah
A	it does
F	it does and it was a kilo jar that's a lot so someone deliberately tried to like eat it like if you were just going to use a little bit every now and then once it got to a certain point you'd be like okay she's going to start to notice I'll stop using it
B	yeah
F	and they obviously were trying to
B	they had like the whole thing
F	I think it was
D	it's the problem with university is that all obviously all the students have just come from living in their own house
F	mm
D	they haven't realised that it's different can't just like go in the fridge
F	well quite a lot of us share our food like the four of us girls in our flat who get on really well we erm we share
D	there's a real weird thing coming in
A	no come in do do it get your two knuckles get your two knuckles and like
F	we share like milk and eggs and erm like and everything
B	I don't know if I'd be able to like share food cos I I'm really like really obsessive with my
F	well we only share the stuff that like it would be silly like cos you know cos first week of uni we had six bottles of milk in the fridge
B	just like the plain things and stuff
D	cos everyone bought milk
F	yeah and what's the point? you know and everyone has their like own bread but like eggs we'll just get a set of like twelve
B	yeah I guess I guess those things
F	cos it just doesn't make sense and and cos we're all quite close if someone's like oh can I I've erm run out of bread can I just borrow a slice of your bread we'd be like yeah that's fine but we always ask each other we don't just like yeah
B	mm?
B	oh
F	so did I
D	I picked him up you're getting old
A	yeah
D	you're losing it completely oh yey a black dog
B	I don't I something is really up with my playlist
D	it's meant to be Christmas
B	it's supposed to be a Christmas playlist but it's got loads of random songs on it and I don't know how
D	this song is Led Zeppelin
F	I've got a Christmas playlist on my Spotify
B	but we don't really
F	this has erm Beats audio
D	oh quality of the semi
A	I hate Beats
D	they're not even that good
A	they're so over yeah so over
D	they're just over branded and over priced because people buy them
A	it's because of will.i.am
B	oh the
D	yeah I mean they they're probably already but the frequency response won't be great so
F	I erm my uncle bought me and my brother those fake Beats
D	fake Beats
F	from China and the you know you could tell that they were fake cos if you looked in the small print on the box there are all like spelling and grammar mistakes because that's what they do to warn like copyright
A	oh they're not open oh it's not
D	mine mine only just does
A	so we always the other day
D	how big is your hand
A	I have really fat wide knuckles so I'm not blessed with a Pringle hand
D	they are only just big enough
A	and I said that the other day to and I said that to my sister cos my sister has a Pringle hand and I say so it's skinny enough and it slips down and my auntie cos my auntie's back from
C	hey
A	doesn't he look sad?
D	just like
C	no he just looks a bit like
B	he's kind of depressed at the moment

B	yeah he is
C	I didn't expect the like I picked him up and I was expecting something much lighter I was like oh god
D	do you not remember from last year?
C	I don't
B	he's probably heavier he's probably heavier than he was last year
D	you were you were out last year I don't know
C	I don't know maybe maybe
D	you and
C	it's just anywhere there's cats you just go to just got to just got to pay attention to them
F	oh I spent erm
A	your lava lamp is working again
F	you know like last week of uni you probably wouldn't have been the same cos of the whole like flood and power cut and stuff but I was I was I was panicking a bit cos I had a three thousand word assignment due for one module and a two and a half thousand word due for another and the a four thousand word group assignment for another and I had a hundred words written for one so I basically lived in the library and I managed to write nearly nine thousand words in two days
B	there's something up with the
D	right
B	it's like inflated
F	and I did a thirteen well I did a fifteen hour stint at my campus so we all left like accommodation we left our flat at like seven
A	what the evening or morning?
F	in the evening and then it got to about five in the morning in the study room and
D	you were sitting in the library all night?
F	so we left the library at erm
A	that's probably why you've got tonsillitis
F	what
D	what from?
C	by
A	no no no from doing like not
F	I know because I slept slept a lot after it like I slept for like two days straight after I'd finished
B	yeah but still that messes up your shift patterns and stuff
F	mm I've done that like all year really I've done that all semester I don't know I think it's just I'm very prone to it I'm not contagious any more though according to the NHS you're not contagious after you've taken antibiotics for twenty-four hours
A	oh okay and then as you're up
D	what is that?
A	see the
B	put it into
A	oh yeah

C	I'll just steal this part here
F	but if you do come down Tuesday nights are like you can go out for like a tenner because it's two pound entry and then drinks are Jaegers are like one pound

D	is
F	it's like twenty minutes and then I went out with them like half way through the semester and it was so boring cos they're really like the girls they'll like have a drink then they'll go on to the dance floor and then five minutes later they'll be like I want to go outside and I have you follow them because if I get left by myself then I'm left by myself and I can't find anyone and then they get like really pissed at me and they're like
F	and then they're like outside for a bit and then they're back on the dance floor and then they're outside again then they're back on the dance floor and I know it's nice to cool down a bit cos it gets like really hot in the club but you know every five minutes in and out in and out in and out you don't get a chance to meet anyone so
D	M U N I C H
F	I don't really talk to them anymore cos they're a bit they're like the typical bitchy girls that I wouldn't have really hung out at school and I was like why am I hanging out with them now? so
