A	no no it's not a made up name
C	I like all the names in Harry Potter
A	they're well chosen aren't they?
C	yes and well made up it's always hard to make names for your characters in books
A	it is
C	cos you need to pick random names
A	well sometimes they have meanings don't they?
C	like banana but you could maybe give that person a nickname instead as a name
A	sorry?
C	you could maybe you could give a person a nickname instead of a name like Solid in Tom Gates his name's probably not Solid
A	I do want you to actually have some of this erm chicken please

B	well he was in a race with the other people who
A	mm
C	erm is this a train race?
A	is this an actual race or is it just a race to get things?
B	a train race
A	oh wow an actual race
C	thank you for taking a lot of my section
B	a race which had things
C	it is not on my section
B	a person who
A	a person who what?
B	and the person who does not break down at any time
A	yeah was was what?
B	had fast wheels
A	mm
B	and was really good
A	mm
B	was the winner five hundred pounds
C	and did he win?
B	he won
A	yay
B	with his rocket he won with the rocket mum
A	that was a lot of money in those days
C	five hundred pounds?
A	mm
C	now now money here is different that would be about five million now
B	the one with the rockets everybody was surprised
A	be about
C	is that more than five million?
A	he spent more than five million
C	no is that more than five million?
A	I've just said it's probably about five hundred thousand the equivalent of cos it'd be a a year's salary like and a really good year salary erm so why did people not expect him to win
C	cos he was new?
B	no because he suggested it first and then all and then the presidents of things they wanted to do the race and they thought they could prove his wrong him wrong
A	about what though?
B	about his idea for the first ever rocket
A	I don't what what are they proving him wrong about or trying to?
B	is this my section?
C	no this is my section there
B	these little bits are mine
C	no that is yours
B	and then
A	what
B	they were trying one of them who's really already idiotic said they can't let him kind he doesn't think that it's okay but
A	but why though?
B	well he does
A	did they think it was dangerous or that it just wouldn't work or what?
B	I guess
A	why?
B	so cos it would just break so they put metal rails instead
A	was it George behind that?
B	no one of his men and then mum
A	mm
B	they had to go they built their own factory and own rails and own rockets and he had a son called George I mean Robert
C	Robert Robert that's a good name for a son
A	see he's the one I've heard of Robert Louis Stevenson
B	never George
A	but I didn't know about George
B	that's cos he born in the eight
C	why are they not famous?
A	mm?
C	he's quite famous
B	in the eighteen seventies and he worked in a coal mine in
A	mm
C	mm need more sugar
A	what a clever person
B	and it was very fun in the beginning cos whenever he
A	sorry what?
B	it was really funny because whenever George sees his dad when he was little said talking about things that he should do if he doesn't want to go then when his son was born and he taught him when he was growing when he was growing up when he had a he said that his son would go so it was really funny
A	what that he wanted to be an inventor?
B	no if if you want to go do a job get the job done
A	wow
B	they didn't even know about trains they just called them trains wanted for them to be called trains
C	cos thinking about it Father Christmas and erm and also Santa he could be called anything I mean literally anything
A	mm
C	as in it's father anything
A	well
C	midwinter
A	before Christianity came a long and St Nicholas is another word for another name for Father Christmas isn't it?
C	I think I do
B	boats boats or old-fashioned cars which couldn't go much further
A	not cars
C	wagons
B	wagons
C	I said wagons
A	not really sort of no
C	er sometimes wagons other times erm chariots
A	stage stagecoaches well chariots were for a long time ago
C	oh yeah but still kind of chariots whatever
A	yeah coaches and canals canal boats
B	and sometimes some boxes with people going erm
C	yeah some people could even
A	well people didn't most people didn't travel very far from where they grew up they stayed in the same area all the time
B	but not George Stephenson he went from there to there to there to there
A	well he sounds like an amazing person
C	I sound like an amazing person
A	would you like to go to the Science Museum to go and look at his rocket?
B	yeah and I might want to piece of it back
A	great idea
C	so you can do it for show and tell
B	yeah
A	does he?
B	and we might be able to get a model from it for the museums
A	mm
A	I keep meaning to take you to places in
C	Samuel Pepys
A	because you like him don't you?
B	He's really interesting
C	mum have I had enough chicken?
B	cos of all the curly wurly hair he had flat hair straight hair like
A	mm
B	like
C	have I had enough cos I only have these left?
B	like that hair
A	but I thought in the pictures he had curly hair
B	that's cos he wears a wig
A	oh and what did he bury under the Great Fire of London?
B	cheese a pigeon and his book
C	cheese pigeon what what about wine didn't he bury some wine
B	oh yeah and some wine
A	wine
C	yeah
A	a pigeon
B	yeah
A	did he?
B	yeah
A	I knew about the cheese and the wine
C	yeah yeah it was yeah
B	in the video of it
A	mm
B	they go to put a they I think they put a pigeon they they put it in one of the boats one of the pigeons
A	and where do we need to take
B	to the library of Simon Pepys
A	yeah
B	you can still see the you can still see his book and he wrote in a different language and he
A	he wrote in a code didn't he? a special code
B	yeah
A	do you know not quite but it was very funny we read about this didn't we? when we went to mummy's old college so there was erm so he left he bequeathed that's called he left his library to oh some family member anyway they donated it to Magdalene and there it is and somebody really wanted but for years they didn't want what the diary's said and the reason why he put it in code is because he was talking about the people of his day sometimes in
C	yeah honest way
A	but in those days you would really get into trouble if people found out about what you thought anyway so it was a code so one of the people erm made it their lifetime's work to try and crack the code okay
C	and they just had to found out erm twenty-six erm something letters
A	no it's a very complicated code and what they they spent about didn't they? I think thirty years trying to crack the code and then they realised I think the same week that in Samuel's library his collection of books there was a little book explaining the code so if he'd just read that then he would have understood the code they didn't really need to have spent thirty years cracking it
C	they might have been able to cos the most er erm nearly crack the code on that
B	what code?
C	erm you know erm get those erm things where you can line up different letters like A is T
A	mm mm
C	I just put
A	when were they doing a spy day mm I'd forgotten about that
C	mm
A	do you remember when we went to Duxford and you were a spy?
C	oh yeah
A	mm and you were as well
C	I'm yeah I'm a
A	mm
B	I don't remember I I missed I wasn't a very good one
A	you were very little
B	yeah
C	I managed to connect a wire
B	can we go there again so I can be a proper spy
A	I don't think they're running it any more
B	oh
A	we made fake French passports do you remember that?
C	yeah and disguised ourselves
A	we did it was lots of fun
B	yeah
A	yeah?
C	yeah I did it today
A	did you? what for show and tell? oh did you? did you bring a postcard with you?
B	yeah and
A	oh
B	she laughed and I said it's not funny
A	it is a little bit funny
C	yeah
B	it wasn't funny for me mum
A	it wasn't funny at the time but it's
B	no way
A	nobody was filming it I'm just saying that some people find it funny well? were people interested?
B	if I did then
A	you didn't mention the bat? what did you talk about?
B	I talked about the
C	ice?
B	I talked about the ice I talked about the pub and I
A	oh did you?
B	and I and I didn't say it was called the Cock Inn I said it was the Rooster Inn
B	so they didn't get so the teacher didn't
A	well there's nothing wrong in saying it's called the Cock Inn it's just yes as we now know it has a range of meanings
C	mm
B	it is quite
C	yes
A	mm
C	I find sewage pipes the funniest
A	but sewage pipes is one meaning and and a male chicken is another
C	I wish there were different ways of pronouncing it
A	there are lots of
C	ah I need to use my cock if you say I need to use my cock it means I need a wee
B	mm
A	that's why cos that's why I said to you it's usually in a sexual context in kind of quite a rude way so I would definitely use it in any sort of context
C	no I just said I need a wee or I need to come I need a
A	well I don't think you need you need to
B	no I could say can I please go to the toilet?
A	yeah if you said could I get my cock out people would be absolutely scandalised and shocked and appalled that a
A	cos it is specifically for sexual kind of
C	meaning
A	mentioning yeah so I I would strongly urge you not to do that
C	I'm not planning on it
A	good well as you know if you ask me the question of the meaning of the word then I will always tell you
C	yeah
B	what's the meaning of poo?
A	well that's you know that already
B	I know
C	er there is a word I know but I'm not sure if I should really say it
A	why?
C	cos it's a swear word I'm wondering what the meaning of it is
A	ask away
C	it's the S word what does it mean?
A	shit that word
C	you just you just swore
A	I was just checking
C	yes it is
A	it means poo
A	well no using the word shit is a swear word
C	er why?
A	I don't know what the etymology I don't know the origin of that word actually
C	is asshole bottom?
A	is sorry
C	asshole bottom?
A	yes asshole that's
C	yeah Back to the Future
A	asshole
C	they swear a lot in that
A	I know surprisingly so we would say arsehole in this country
C	or bum I know what the S word means and actually the B word isn't a B word isn't a erm a swear word it just means female dog
A	yes but men particularly use it in a derogatory manner in a negative manner
C	yeah like the son of a boop
A	but that's it's a nasty word to use against women
C	yeah so that's why I didn't say it
A	quite right too
C	erm I either say a something word or
A	sorry?
C	I either say something word like the B word the F word the S word something like that or I just cover my month with my hand and say beep
A	yeah or just don't swear
C	yeah I don't swear
B	well I thought I would
C	although someone would
A	well that's that's not a nice word
B	after I once watched a Back the Future thing I accidently said the S word at dad's and I was like ah and I was crying because I said it
C	yeah too much Back to the Future
B	yeah I didn't mean to say it and dad knew that cos I was crying because I
A	mm
C	yeah and she just cried because dad went what did dad say?
A	how did dad react?
B	he was he was just trying to calm me down because he knew I said it by accident and he knew I didn't want to say it
A	mm
B	because if I did
A	you were just testing it out really from what you'd heard
B	I wasn't I just accidently said it
A	how did you accidently say it?
C	oh she watched too much Back to the Future and they say that quite a lot in this one
B	I was going to say oh no and then I just said it and went ah
A	mm
B	shockly
A	well if that happens again you've got to try and say oh sugar instead
B	okay
A	there's nothing wrong with that
B	oh sugar
C	and if you say and if you're going to say the F word say ah fudge and
A	foozle I say
B	banana
C	ah banana
C	is there a P word?
B	yeah
A	not that I not that I know of
B	potato head
C	yeah cos if you were going to say the P word you could say oh potato
A	mm
C	and the B word
A	mm
C	or whatever it is
A	when you're a teenager you will probably swear
A	but you will not be allowed to swear in your in school or if you get a like a Saturday job you wouldn't be able to do that then
B	I know
C	or you'd get fired
A	mm
C	burning hot
