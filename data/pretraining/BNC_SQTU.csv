E	well
B	and now the quiz
A	we've had our quiz as well
C	well we've had erm the first quiz
A	where
D	yeah
A	so what do you wanna do? if you win you get five points if you're second you get four?
C	yeah
B	oh okay right yeah
D	well I've been on the losing side haven't I?
E	England won thirty-one twenty-one the final score so they got the grand slam
B	it's not a grand slam
E	yes it is
B	is it? oh I dunno yeah that's what I'm saying
A	oh right yeah
B	won is it?
E	well no they beat every other country there
B	oh okay
E	that's like
D	good for them
B	why are you going in there?
C	it's closer
B	what's wrong with this one here?
C	I liked looking at the bath
D	do you want your crossword game wherever it is?
C	if people are up for it if not
B	what's the crossword game?
B	oh
C	it's not it's erm well if people wanna play
B	yeah
C	yes?
B	yeah but is it easy?
C	it's a word one
B	yeah
C	easy enough
A	twenty-five
B	twenty-five
C	where are the games?
A	oh here
C	so you'd have twenty-five words on the table
B	what?
C	there would be one
A	I dunno
C	I'll I'll it's I'll just I'll show you
A	yeah
C	I knew that this card this card this card would be red I knew these ones would be blue and if I give a clue where my red team accidentally go for a blue one they're given a point to the other team so for example they and
B	how do you know the what do you mean you know that they're red?
C	cos this grid tells me
B	oh okay
C	so I would say knight a knight of armour
B	yeah
C	I would say night two and they know that there are two cards out there pertain to night
B	oh okay
C	they would say suit and day however if there was something else that I hadn't seen
B	yeah
C	they could accidently or go yeah a suit right a knight wears a suit but I didn't think about the connection between knight and
B	yeah
C	so basically you're gonna have a list of the one player on each team will see that there's this is the five by five grid and they'll know if you're looking at it from this way that this is red this is red this is red but these two are two this is neutral so if you do this by mistake
B	mm
C	you haven't got a point but then you haven't lost the point
B	mm
C	this is neutral this is neutral this is red this is red and this black one is if any player from any team chooses
B	oh yeah
C	but obviously you might go right yeah table leg I'll
B	mm
C	that one away
B	mm okay
C	any questions?
A	how do you make sure you get those cards the right way round?
C	erm you've just gotta remember so there's a little stand that you can just put it on
A	okay
C	and it will be in front of you but because there's five which is a bit of a weird number and I have I've only played this once before it's up to you you're
E	that's easier isn't it?
C	yeah
D	right yeah I'll do it
C	yeah?
D	uhu
C	okay
B	oh yeah
C	okay so one of do you wanna be the blue or the reds?
E	blue
C	okay so if mum and dad go first you're the blue team
B	uhu
C	but cos you're going first
B	okay
C	by getting a point if
B	uhu
C	you've won the game we've gotta do it eight times cos we're not going first
B	okay
C	if you say
B	okay
C	but again there's one black card
B	uhu
C	which is the assassin so if anyone there's gonna be one of these cards now which is
B	for the assassin?
C	yeah and
B	yeah
C	that will go on there then
A	and does is it
C	when we're right or wrong?
A	yeah
C	so
A	uhu
C	that pertain to that clue
A	right
C	and we'll say which one do you think it is? okay we think it's circle and shoe and when we touch them that means we're locked in and he will go we will put either according his grid either the red card
A	oh okay
C	which we won the blue card the neutral card or the assassin card
A	okay yeah yeah yeah
C	mum and dad need to be listening to what we're saying as well because you'll get clues from what we're saying and you'll know if if
B	oh okay
C	right?
B	okay so he's gonna yeah okay
C	so if your first two or three
B	so he's gonna give clues yeah
C	but really you're doing well you'll will be doing really well if you can get three cards that are all blue
A	yeah
C	that can all be linked by one word
B	yeah
C	so you can't use a foreign word you can't use an accent
D	okay
C	and you couldn't say for example bed bug because bug is there
D	yeah yeah
C	or you can say battery pack whatever
D	okay shall we start? is there a time?
C	er it comes with a timer but it just says you put a timer when someone's when like if someone's taking ages on it just
D	no no just okay er creature three
A	who's that to? either or?
E	well it's
D	no it's the they're first
A	oh they're first yeah sorry
B	well we've got
E	there's there's
B	Loch Ness
E	mammoth
B	there's octopus
E	octopus and er
B	so that's the three then isn't it?
E	that's what I would say
B	oh no there's bug
E	no I don't think he wouldn't he
B	what did he say?
E	creature
D	creature
B	a bug is a creature
A	no you wouldn't say that it's an American
B	mm
C	and also so you've seen those three there could be the card comfort
B	there could
C	that you would have completely missed
B	that could have gone
C	and not
D	yeah
C	seen that as well and they would have right so you you need to be conscious of what else is there
D	it's gonna be er literal
B	do you think so?
D	yeah
B	so do you want to go with those?
E	yeah unless you think it's bug it's up to you
B	no I I'll go with you and we'll
C	no no no so you just you just tap them and
B	Loch Ness
B	and mammoth
D	yep
C	cos whoever goes first gets an extra card
D	yeah
C	you going for
A	no
D	clothes
B	suits two
C	cotton
A	I wouldn't say cotton so it's more material than clothes
C	so it's shoes
D	sorry no
D	okay
D	I forgot you were reds that's pretty important
D	okay
C	er it's one word
D	well it's no it's three
C	it counts in the manual I read
D	this is pretty tough erm
C	but
D	no well you can okay erm
C	eight
A	why is it time? oh two is the number okay I thought that was like the timed
C	no hang on time table
A	mm but it's times table
C	okay
D	isn't the best clue obviously
C	well then date and day
A	day and dates yeah
C	makes more sense yeah
A	mm
C	ah now we can have another guess no
D	oh okay
C	we could put three cards down mum and dad's and
D	okay
E	suit
B	suits
E	suit and shoe
B	how many did you say?
D	two
B	suit and shoe
C	one two three four five six
D	erm
C	okay
C	mm
A	okay
C	so er out of the two I would guess those two right?
A	okay
E	so on that occasion
C	yeah
E	but you think it might be
C	no because I think he would have put
E	but you can
A	mm
E	put an extra card
C	yeah but remember
E	it's extra
C	there's always gonna be one card out of these
E	that's
C	that would kill the
B	kill you
C	could lose you the game also it could be a neutral which will help you on your next turn or it could be a blue which would give you a point
C	but the say say there was one
D	okay
C	if
E	but why would you do that though?
C	cos you wouldn't wanna lose the points
E	okay
C	but we could use the knowledge that he thinks there's another gemmologist one out there in the future
E	next time
C	so yeah do you wanna say that and that?
A	yeah
C	okay
E	okay
B	table and server
E	yes
C	okay so they've only got one left now so that means to win the game unless they're wrong we need a big score so even though
D	okay
A	mm
D	okay erm
C	how many?
D	erm
C	five?
D	you wanna win it don't you?
C	yeah
A	web
C	web
A	key
C	battery
C	and plastic?
A	or thumb like
A	technology
C	mm right definitely cell and web and battery right? or
A	yeah
C	maybe not sure about plastic er plastic is not
A	could port be it? like technology port?
C	on a computer?
A	yeah
C	he does like computers
C	no because you can't tell if it's right
D	oh it's all or nothing?
E	yeah but you can't tell
C	but you can't
E	tell them they've already got one
D	oh yeah
C	right these two I would say
A	and battery
C	battery
A	I think key and plastic more than port
C	are we discounting thumb?
A	mm?
C	are we discounting thumb?
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	okey-doke then
C	right cell web plastic key and battery
B	oh
E	it's port it's obviously port
B	oh it's gotta be port
C	reinvented
A	oh
D	mm it is hard
A	really hard for you more than anybody
E	you didn't put port it's not
D	well I didn't think they'd get
E	but plastic's not technology is it?
D	plastic isn't a technology
E	it isn't it's a product of technology it's not technology
D	well there you go well everything is technology
A	it's good
C	it's hard isn't it?
A	it is hard especially for you it was really hard
B	mm
A	cos finding a link just anyway but er matching it to the
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	to the grid is really difficult
D	it's good though
A	yeah
C	it could have worked if think in two teams because then you would oh no you'd always be the guy seeing it then
A	so you always need it to be an odd number really
C	no it's just one no because if it's three on three one person off each team would always be the guy giving the clues
E	that would make it
A	but they would always see the grid
E	that's a very hard game
C	what?
A	they would always see the grid
C	yeah
A	okay
E	yeah it would make a
D	yeah
A	it's not that dissimilar to Only Connect kind of like your wall type
C	in a way
A	finding your links
C	mm
E	yeah that's a good game
A	mm
D	erm
C	are you going to bed?
