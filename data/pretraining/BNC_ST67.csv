A	so
B	yeah
A	do you have to pay for the use of that
B	eh?
A	do you have to pay for the use of that plugging in?
B	I don't know
A	really?
B	car park yeah
A	that's weird
B	I wonder how long they take
A	I know yeah
A	like charging your phone or something
B	well the thing is if you have an electric car
A	oh do they not last that long?
B	no they're not really
A	yeah
B	motorway travelling
A	ah
B	which'd probably be quite difficult doing a
A	mm
B	different fuels you could use
A	yeah it must be
B	it's four o'clock
A	I know
B	probably about half way there I think
B	it says it on the website ring us if you're arriving
A	oh
B	subject to delays if you're
A	yeah
B	to give you the key
B	and they may give out your room to someone else
A	huh
A	I know
B	how could they give it out to anyone else?
A	like would they just give it to someone for
B	I think it's unlikely you'd think they'd ring you first or
A	yeah
B	let's hope
A	yeah
B	and we've stopped having a break so
A	they had sun cream two for eight pounds or something in Asda
B	really I'm
A	did you?
A	the little the little Asda near my house?
B	no the big Asda in
A	no well the little Asda near my house
B	yeah but they have to be the same what kinda sun cream was it?
A	Nivea
B	oh right
B	I got Nivea
A	oh why?
B	cos it was cheap
B	it was on offer it was half price
A	that's like factor fifty or something isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it should've been ten pound got it for five so I thought well
A	oh that's alright
B	why would I pay more? for
A	yeah and it's less as well
B	yeah I think this one had
A	oh
B	so I thought right I'm going for the
A	it's not the coloured one is it?
B	what's coloured?
A	cos you can get kids' coloured fifty so it's like for water and it's like green on your skin
B	otherwise I'll be walking round with a green face
B	why do they do that? just cos kids like it?
A	no I think it's
A	I think it also shows you if it's still on
B	yeah cos you see
A	yeah
B	and on their lips they have like a coloured thing
A	but the one the coloured one it it would say coloured
B	ah
A	and I think it's either
B	or it shows you when it's wearing off?
A	yeah or it show
B	yeah
A	Australia
B	in Australia
A	quite rightly so though
B	well yeah I can understand why you know cos there's so much sun
A	yeah
A	well midday
B	well yeah I think somebody
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	but yeah like there's
B	yeah supposedly even when it's not sunny
A	even when it's overcast
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean I never
A	no
B	I've only
A	yeah
B	first day we'll put the tent up and I started to get really sunburnt
A	yeah
B	and then I've never used it since
A	but yeah like a
B	then
A	a lot of people recommend
B	now I'm going on holiday I thought I better buy some cos we're gonna be out a lot
A	yeah
B	a lot what?
A	a lot of people recommend wearing it every day
B	yeah if you ever speak to somebody who knows about this they
A	yeah
B	they say you should wear it
A	it takes forever to put it on
B	well just maybe just doing your face and arms maybe
A	yeah
B	if you're on a beach and
A	I know but you know like face and arms? it's just it's a pain to like rub it all in and then
B	yeah I if you know you're gonna be out all day it's probably a good idea isn't it you even if it's overcast and
A	yeah
B	erm
A	no well the sun's so weak in England that you don't even get vitamin D from it in the winter
B	yeah
A	there's only a few months a year that you can get vitamin D in England
B	really?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	really?
A	well
B	I thought it's the only vitamin that you can't get from food
A	no yeah there's a few foods that you can get it from
B	that's a quite rare thing though isn't it?
A	yeah but
B	mm
A	grandma's like oh you don't wanna be a vegetarian
B	is she?
A	yeah cos she's like the even doctors say that it's better to eat meat and I'm like no it doesn't matter
B	there's loads of them isn't there? they don't seem to have health problems
A	no well I'm er
A	fine yeah
B	what does it say?
A	yeah
B	such as?
A	don't know
B	well if you're
A	yeah
B	making sure that you're not
A	yeah
B	I think a lot of people when they do it they they just don't give enough thought to it and they
A	yeah
B	just say right I'm not gonna eat meat and then they
A	yeah
B	and it's
A	it's not bad
B	mm
A	well I don't know she probably thinks that I probably won't bother
B	I I mean
A	no it's cos I don't want the animals to die
A	ethical reasons
B	yeah you wouldn't done it
A	why?
B	well because if you were bothered about the
A	because I don't know what I'm doing I'll probably just
B	yeah yeah but you've had loads of time
A	and I can't do it at I can't do it at home because I can't
B	you can
A	I don't I don't have
A	the food that I need
B	well you'd have to say to your mamI'm not eating meat and it's up to your mam to
A	well then I'll just die from the
A	the the I cos I won't be eating the right stuff because
B	why? tell your mammy what you need
A	no she won't she can't afford it
B	why?
A	separately to the food that she's gonna buy
B	just leave the meat out
A	well then
A	cos I literally eat like I probably don't get enough
B	but you don't if you're eating all these
A	yeah I just eat rubbish at the moment so if I then didn't eat
B	how much? what what does it cost to buy a bag of vegetables?
A	it
B	yeah
A	but
B	I don't think it's gotta be cheaper
B	meat is the dear thing
A	no because we don't buy meat it's like god knows what's in it
A	cos it's cheap
B	so
A	yeah
B	goodness from the
A	but it's cheap cos we can afford it
B	you're not
A	yeah
B	from the food
A	I know but then it's still it's more expensive
A	it is though
B	I could make a meal for a pound
A	yeah
B	get four portions out of that
A	yeah and there well there's four of us at the moment
B	oh right so that's you know? whatever you do you have to make four don't you so?
A	yeah
B	you know it's it's gonna cost you a bit for four people to even
A	yeah
B	eat processed food
A	so we literally
B	you're not really gonna get one meal for a pound each
A	no
B	it's gonna be hard to get that
A	yeah
B	otherwise it's not gonna be
A	yeah
B	one bag
A	yeah and then that's like one meal for a day
B	yeah I know but there there's other meals that you can
A	yeah
B	and and incorporate vegetables
A	but still that adds up over a week
B	yeah but that
A	no but it's not
B	it's less than a pound a meal
A	I don't know whatever we're doing at the moment
B	well I
A	no we don't buy a ready meal
B	they cost a pound anyway
A	we just buy like
A	and then like
B	yeah
A	and you feel full
B	still probably
A	but the thing is
B	no I'm just saying you though
A	yes
B	you can you can say
A	yeah but we we like spend
B	well twenty pound is different to ten pound
B	yeah but you they have to buy
A	yeah and then we have like
B	twenty P sauce?
A	yeah you can get a jar of sauce for twenty P to put on pasta
B	ugh
A	cheap
B	you sound like you're living in poverty
A	pretty much
B	but I don't understand why you have to have your food eaten like that when your mammy's on a teacher's wage
A	because we've had all these expenses
B	yeah so then
B	yeah yeah that's all been paid off now the house is sold
A	yeah but she's not she's not gonna be getting paid
B	well she doesn't need to worry about that till the time but
A	what?
B	you know they
A	well they're gonna ask for it back and also she's only gonna get paid half wage for a third amount of time and then she's gonna be on like nothing
B	well half wage is still
A	but do you know how much our water is because we don't have a water meter
A	that's a lot isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and we I don't I don't know like that's just
B	maybe you should get a meter
A	yeah but we're just thinking because if grandma and granddad are still there
A	erm
B	yeah
A	keep it because
B	yeah
A	but that's that's a lot
B	then again maybe it's not a good idea have the meter you'll be
B	so oh can't afford to have a shower
A	well our you know our shower at the moment?
A	our showers are like thirty seconds
B	you don't have to
A	I know well no but our shower's like a dribble and it's like cold and it's
B	oh
A	I don't know I know it's well she wasn't going to but I think she might it depends how much money
B	what's your water pressure like?
A	well it's an electric shower it's like
B	no I don't I mean er
A	I don't know
B	say you're running the
A	oh it's not very good
B	cos you could have a shower like in mine where it's attached to the taps
A	yeah
B	my water pressure's good though so it comes out really strong
A	well the plumber was like yeah
A	it's three hundred pounds
B	is it? how do you know?
A	looked it up
A	no but like the cos it would be with installation as well like we'd get that one taken out and then put in and then
B	yeah
A	like the price of the shower might not be that much but
B	you can probably get a shower for around a hundred
A	yeah
B	you can always shop around get
A	but we don't but like if we're changing this one we might if the if the cheap one that we're gonna buy
B	yeah
A	is like no better we might as well just keep this one
B	remember that lovely big shower
A	I know that was so nice
B	you didn't sit down and read a book like
A	it was good
A	yeah it was good that shower
B	well you might
A	I bet I won't
B	like a
A	I bet the shower won't be good
B	you can complain say I'm paying this much money
A	I know
A	there'll be like don't stay in halls then
A	like it's only a room you'd think it's cheaper
B	yeah
A	although it'd probably be more expensive to rent
B	probably
A	yeah so it's probably not bad really
B	no I'm full
A	I don't really want one but I'm just eating them
A	my ears have popped
B	really?
A	mm
B	not far from
A	no
A	no cold sea
B	yeah
A	would you?
B	I'd go in
A	are you going to?
B	I don't know
B	it's not gonna be warm is it this country?
A	no
A	I don't know why people go in the cold sea
B	to have fun
A	but it's not fun though it's cold
B	you get used to it quickly don't you once you're in? you used to go in it when you were younger
A	I know I wasn't bothered then
B	yeah
A	it's just like yeah water
B	oh right yeah
A	but it's still cold even with my wet suit
B	no I don't think it was too bad with a wet suit was it?
A	yeah
B	was it?
A	it was still quite cold
B	that's the River
A	oh
B	there's the sea the other side
A	oh maybe
A	mm
B	that's some kind of dockyard up there
A	it is warm now isn't it?
A	but the clouds trap the heat don't they?
B	I don't know
A	because that's kind of how global warming is like all the the the pollution gas
A	rebounds
B	oh right
A	so I don't know maybe clouds don't work like that
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah but most of the time when it's cloudy it tends to be
A	yeah
B	that's generally cos the sun's not getting through isn't it?
A	what?
A	there's no dirt
B	no but you're gonna stamp it on something
B	you think you
A	yeah
B	so you can lie down and have a sleep
A	camper van
B	mm
A	oh look at all those trees
B	yeah
A	what animals do you think there are in there
B	that's a buzzard
A	oh
A	if you think about it like going into the forest in England isn't really that dangerous because what's gonna get you?
B	well I know
B	it would've been in the past
A	yeah
B	we've killed all the er
A	and the bears
B	yeah and the the lynx they were saying they want to
A	oh yes let's have some lynx
B	and er they want to reintroduce wolves
A	oh
B	er they were saying er they had
A	probably
A	oh yeah boar
A	mm
B	well obviously there'll there'll there'll be forest where
A	I like lynx
B	quite small aren't they for wild cats? apparently?
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	well yeah you'd be startled wouldn't you?
A	you'd be like oh
B	well I would even if they reintroduced them I would imagine the sightings would be very rare
A	yeah they'd just be hidden wouldn't they in the?
B	cos they're saying deer
A	really? we got too many? I've never seen deer in the wild
A	oh yeah
A	oh I like deers
B	and occasionally they they have to do a cull
A	yeah
B	so they're saying well let's have a natural
A	yeah
A	I remember we were looking for like bushes
B	they're expensive?
A	yeah
B	why can't you just grow them?
A	well yeah we could but it would take years
A	erm
A	and er some of them it would say like deer proof and I was like I wish I had deers coming into my garden like the
A	yeah
A	I don't think erm
B	no they wouldn't they'd be too scared of us
A	cos like the wolves would wouldn't they?
B	you know they say wolves don't
A	yeah
A	oh right
B	but I think why
A	oh
B	but humans I think they try to steer clear of
A	oh we still have foxes don't we yeah?
B	yeah
A	but they eat take livestock but I suppose they're not as like big as wolves are they?
B	no
A	chickens
B	probably wouldn't get a
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they wanted to bring it back in though didn't they?
B	who did?
A	Conservatives
A	oh were they?
A	so they wanted to bring it in then?
B	well I don't know whether they were thinking about it you know when they were
A	yeah
B	a lot of people are against it
A	yeah
B	so I guess they weighed up should we do it because the people who want it are our voters
A	yeah
B	probably
A	didn't we use to have moose here?
B	no
A	no? are they in like cold places?
A	yeah
A	oh
B	rather than moose isn't it?
A	although those people on that programme were eating moose
A	that one where they were living in the Arctic Circle
B	yeah
A	yeah that was moose
B	oh right so that would be it must be in the north where they inhabit
A	yeah
B	it was like
A	with the reindeer
B	I was thinking it
A	there are elks
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so there was tigers and that kind of thing
A	oh
B	lions
A	wouldn't that be good?
B	well not really
B	you get people being eaten by tigers in India still
A	yeah but
B	well I guess generally maybe sometimes if
A	yeah
B	killed a human then they might see it as prey then in the future and start
A	yeah
B	yeah I would imagine yeah
B	and they're
A	and they
A	they're yeah and they're like quite solitary like you know they don't live in a thing like
B	yeah
A	I think
B	yeah they're much more independent minded
A	cos I know that cats have erm
B	yeah
A	so
A	yeah cos they all live in a pack
B	yeah
A	but lions all live in like a
B	yeah
A	they all like
B	yeah
A	maybe with with other cats it's like a kind of general territory
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so the the female has to do the hunting but the male
A	yeah
B	choice
A	yeah
B	he just kinda lazes around
A	I think but erm it's the male ones that fight each other
B	but he is in charge of it
A	I know that that's in lions
B	yeah the lion he'll say
A	yeah
B	this is my area
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	their manes look really soft I'd like to
A	yeah do you think they're like soft? like their fur? like generally do you think it's like soft or do you think it's a bit like more of like a hair?
B	well it's probably fairly soft
A	yeah
B	well it's like a cat isn't it?
A	yeah
B	they're still soft aren't they? whereas hooved animals like horses and
A	yeah cos I stroked erm
A	a zebra
A	yeah
B	what is that when they're first growing or something?
A	oh maybe
A	the ones that I saw were soft
B	yeah
A	I think that's deers that when they first grow
B	I don't know
A	yeah but I imagine reindeers might have that soft thing on it cos it's cold
A	yeah
A	oh yeah antlers I was calling them horns
B	the cold there's no
A	yeah
B	right where's this
A	was it like
B	yeah
B	oh in the otter sanctuary?
A	oh was it that one yeah I thought it was
B	yeah
A	and then that that one with the antlers the male one started like
A	grinding its hoof against the ground or something and I was like
B	I
A	oh
B	it wouldn't've got close though it wouldn't
A	do you think? I don't know I was getting quite close to it and it was like oh hello
B	I guess they're fairly used to
A	and then that other one and I was like I don't wanna get charged so
B	I don't think I'd have the nerve to go up to a lion or anything like that
A	not in the wild but I might do at a zoo
B	at well a zoo they still they're not tame or anything
A	I know but some of them are more used to people aren't they?
B	yeah but the the keepers don't necessarily go in with them
A	some of them do it depends
B	I think I think I would just have a natural fear and once they
A	oh yeah
B	did you hear that lion roaring at
A	yeah
B	I mean it was
A	do you know lynxes roar?
B	is it not more of a
B	like a
A	a miaow I don't know
B	a miaow but you know like er
A	it's
B	like a leopard or
A	I think
B	what do they do?
A	I don't know they must just kind of
B	miaow
A	yeah
B	what's a tiger
A	yeah
B	quite deep and
A	like a er
B	growl yeah
A	and it's like a it's almost like a purr
B	yeah it's not
A	it's like a rolling noise isn't it?
B	yeah a lion is really really loud
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and they're just like
A	I know like I wish I could do that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that was a lion
A	yeah and then at the reunion thing where he comes and it recognises them and it comes and hugs them
B	yeah
A	if it recognises them
A	but I think those two men went like yeah
B	yeah
A	he she and then they got to stroke her as well
B	yeah and that was a wild lion
A	yeah
A	and then there were these
B	yeah
A	and I was like
B	what kind of bear?
A	what?
B	what kind of bear is that?
A	I think it was a grizzly
B	it's a bit big to be sitting at a dining table
A	yeah it was massive
B	eh?
A	I know
A	I know yeah
B	did he not realise with the noise that they were making?
B	what country's that in?
A	China
B	oh right
A	but
B	yeah
A	and it was like some like endangered bear so that's why they're running like a sanctuary now
B	mm
A	oh I really like panda bears
A	are panda bears like? they're not vicious are they?
B	I think they're quite docile aren't they?
A	yeah they don't
B	never hear about that do you?
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
A	yeah because they've got to each so much of the bamboo
B	makes you wonder how they get so big though
A	I know yeah
B	there must be something good in the the bamboo to get them that big
A	well there is but they have to eat like for I don't know how many
B	can't the Chinese try and get them used to a different kind of food
A	I know I think it's it's just how they've evolved
B	can't they say here have a
A	probably wouldn't eat it
B	they look obese
A	but even the big ones seem so friendly like you could like you could like cuddle them and they look soft
A	I don't know I would if I was a keeper well they go in with them like it's fine to go in with them and
B	yeah
A	I saw them in with the red pandas as well
B	yeah
A	and they're so cute and they were like climbing on the erm
B	yeah
A	I think so yeah
B	yeah
A	but the local people at the erm
B	yeah
A	it's nice
A	not but like in in the past
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
B	I think they realise now that they've got to be
A	yeah
A	I don't know
B	I think the problem is it is a dwindling
A	yeah
B	I mean some of that has been because of humans as well so
A	yeah
B	maybe
A	because like people can like eat so many different things but then there's like other animals that just like live on this
B	I think we've
A	I wonder what we would eat in the wild
B	well we were probably originally foragers weren't we?
A	we wouldn't be able to do much else
B	yeah I mean really just berries and
A	plants
A	yeah
B	that kind of thing
A	yeah
A	it's weird that that's what bears eat isn't it like berries and
B	yeah
A	but I mean some birds eat fish don't they?
B	yeah
A	but they just eat like
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	cos they're really dangerous
B	yeah
A	we don't have anything
A	and our skin
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah if if we didn't like if we couldn't make tools or anything we'd literally be
B	yeah
A	like we don't have claws we don't have teeth
B	well
A	we probably can't run that fast
B	maybe originally we were furry weren't we?
A	erm
B	well we had a lot more hair didn't we?
A	yeah
B	probably not that much to kind of keep
A	maybe kind of like monkeys
B	yeah but why would you start losing that fur?
A	er it might've just been a
B	yeah
A	and it's like
B	mm
A	you know like a random thing?
B	yeah
A	cos that does happen sometimes so like the people with those genes died out and then
B	where are these people with fur why did they develop?
A	I don't know how we were
B	they could be cross breeding as well with other
A	yeah
B	human type species couldn't they?
A	yeah they do you know they might've been
B	yeah
A	do you think there was ever like different people like that?
B	well they know there were there was erm
A	oh is there?
B	I'm sure there is I don't know the name
A	yeah
B	stronger than us but
A	yeah
B	a a small percent
A	oh
B	their DNA
A	see there might've been more though we don't know about
B	well there might be yeah just cos they've
A	they might've
B	cos they've got
A	yeah because I've always
B	yeah
A	there's not not like
B	well I guess
A	yeah I mean there's that race but
B	but I don't
A	it's not like you wouldn't you wouldn't really call it like
B	well no
A	you wouldn't be like oh there's other humans like oh what are they? they're like
B	would you class er
A	I don't know are they like variations or something?
B	the species is kind of the cat family isn't there?
A	yeah
B	but then again it they with the human thing they'd be part of humanoids wouldn't they?
A	yeah
B	would they be variations on it like cats I suppose or?
A	yeah
B	they'd have different characteristics erm
A	cos there's so many different types of cats like
B	well dogs is they all come from a wolf don't they?
A	yeah but like within like
B	well that's through breeding human interference that
A	yeah
B	cos you said
A	no but aren't like foxes are they like? part of the
B	oh I don't know
A	or maybe they're not
B	I don't know if they're classed as the same kind of family are they?
A	maybe there was something else
B	no you never see them being mentioned do you you know when like you mentioned canines?
A	yeah maybe they're not
A	they will yeah and they kind of have a bit of a bark don't they well not a bark but
B	yeah
A	cos
B	well they're not a cat you know it's it's
A	no
B	very similar characteristics to a dog isn't it the snout?
A	yeah
B	the claws
A	I mean
B	no they're different a dog's are quite rough aren't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah they say we did
A	yeah
B	cos there's there's the
A	yeah
A	I think tails would be quite useful
B	well
A	cos you think they'd they'd be useful wouldn't you?
B	they would yeah they'd be useful for getting rid of insects
A	but like balance
B	well when you're up in the trees yeah
A	must've never needed them any more yeah
B	maybe they got in the way of
A	yeah maybe predators like grabbed them or something
B	yeah
A	who knows?
B	yeah
A	I think there was someone in there once with like a tail
B	yeah
A	so
B	no wasn't it something else though and it looked like a tail?
A	maybe
B	kind of like a bone er?
A	yeah but that's what a tail would be
B	well part of it would be and
A	yeah
A	well there's like been people born with extra legs and things
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you get separate
A	cos that's what we learnt in GCSE biology but there must be a lot more to it but that's what they teach us basically at GCSE biology
B	yes
A	oh
A	yeah
B	it's a lot
A	yeah I like mountains
A	oh yeah
B	just shows you how massive a mountain range they are
A	I think it'd be nice to live in the mountains
B	yeah
A	although where would you get your food from?
B	shop
A	yeah I know but you they
A	yeah
B	but any rural areas a bit dearer isn't it?
A	yeah
B	cos everything has to come in by road
A	no but if you were like in the countryside all the produce would be grown there
B	yeah and
A	why do they send it out of the country?
B	cos
A	oh
B	yeah
A	meant like
B	no
A	I was like why's it going?
B	but you know even if you're getting carrots and things from Tesco
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	do whatever they want in the
B	oh when you live in
A	yeah so they can breathe the air
B	yeah you're adapted yeah
B	yeah
A	is that like similar to what divers get when they come up too fast
B	no I think it's probably different symptoms like they've got
A	or is that something
B	they've got like the bends
A	is that oh isn't that when you get like?
B	it does something to your blood
A	oxygen
B	yeah yeah it's a different thing so I'm not quite sure
A	cos you always see on the films like people swimming up from the depths like
B	yeah well you have to be really deep though I think to get it
A	oh right
B	to have that as a consideration
A	oh like when the pressure like you but you can hardly really feel it when you go down there can't you?
B	yeah cos
A	oh
B	like a bell or something that that the
A	but the the people who
A	the people who dive for pearls they go down quite far
B	I think it's cos they're not down there for long
A	and they
B	cos they're holding their breath
B	yeah
A	oh right yeah
B	cos
A	oh so when you go in a submarine?
B	your blood
A	do you think you'd have to
B	no er
A	oh like in a plane? like in a plane
A	oh
B	which then the pressure's controlled in that
A	yeah
B	then when they come up they stay there and sleep there
A	yeah well it'd be dangerous wouldn't it?
B	well yeah it must be
A	oh
B	yeah but I mean
B	suffocating wouldn't it?
A	yeah like you'd think that you would be in a plane but in a plane it's not bad
B	well
A	oh
B	on a submarine don't they?
A	I know then it's all that horrible and metal isn't it and like it can't be very comfortable
B	they must have things in there to do
A	what do they do in submarines?
B	what do you mean?
A	what are they doing? why are they down there?
B	well the reason we have submarines now
A	yeah
B	er well for the
A	spying
B	well no it's er they have submarines with cruise missiles in them
A	oh
B	which are
A	yeah
B	so instead of having
A	yeah
B	you can go down so deep in a submarine and sail anywhere in the world
A	yeah
B	and they won't know you're there
A	oh can they not
B	well
A	sonar?
B	well
A	yeah
B	obviously it's like a cat and mouse game isn't it?
B	they try not to be found
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so you're like oh there they are and
B	well yeah they do they go off on exercises to
A	yeah in the submarine that
B	but recently the erm
A	oh
B	you know since there's a bit of unease now between like Russia and the West
A	yeah
B	cos of
A	really?
B	and we have to send up our jet fighters just to kind of stay close to them say
A	yeah
B	we know you're here
A	a Cold War brewing
A	yeah
B	you know
A	oh yeah?
B	see what see what it says on the thing there so
B	yeah
B	keep going down through each section
B	you don't have to read it all just tell me
B	where am I leaving the
A	leave
B	so
A	the
B	right
A	then merge onto the
B	alright that'll do till we get a bit closer then you can read it out again
A	I feel like
B	still got about a hundred miles to go so
A	feel like I read that quite professionally
B	yeah
B	you could get a job as
A	I know I could yeah
B	what like a storyteller?
A	nooo
B	well you're too good for British Rail
B	feels like they're holding their nose
A	maybe maybe they need me
B	you could be a broadcaster
A	yeah
B	this is the news
B	from
B	bong
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like the people who do the weather actually the people who work out the weather
B	I know they're very qualified
A	yeah
B	you could do the Tube
A	yeah
B	speaking clock
A	what speaking clock?
B	if you dial
A	oh right
B	somebody said
A	yeah
B	the time is now
A	yeah
B	like for all the different times
A	really?
B	yeah
A	but you know the erm? when you're on the train and they say
B	yeah
A	the conductor who says it
B	is it?
A	yeah they go into their little cabin and then they speak it
B	how do you know?
A	I've noticed I've been on so many trains
B	have you?
A	you know like it's not that clear usually it's a bit? it's cos it's not prerecorded it's like them they go in and they say it
A	no
B	the next platform but
A	no yeah on the Tube cos it's quite professional on the Tube but on Northern Rail
B	oh you mean you're on the train to
A	yeah
B	yeah most of the ones yeah
A	but it's so funny on that Laurel and Hardy
B	is that when they're on the sleeping thing?
A	yeah
B	I can't remember that bit
A	and then it's so funny
B	yeah
A	it was always good on mine though like when it said erm
B	I'm surprised they announce it you're not gonna need it to be announced you can look out the window see where it's stopping can't you?
A	no but when you're on the platform yeah I know they announce it but like but in case you can't see it I suppose depending where you're sat
A	and they announce it just before you arrive you know in case you don't know where you're going
B	oh right
A	and it would announce all the places and I was like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	would you like to go?
A	no
A	yeah it goes through
B	go through to
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	it goes through that
A	ah
A	yeah
B	like
A	it was always
B	like that was
A	the next train to arrive at platform one is the
B	you sound very professional
B	so that wouldn't be difficult and that's recorded
A	yeah that one's recorded but
B	yeah
A	that that's the one that's the conductor
B	yeah
A	and it's quite muffled because it's them saying it
B	oh no I hate how they
A	and then they'll like repeat it and I'll be listening extra hard and I'll be like I I don't know what you're saying
B	in
B	might've been
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	at the airport I think it's probably different languages but
A	yeah well at
B	yeah
A	and the erm
B	but it's it's so
A	cos
B	cos everybody knows
A	they can
B	yeah
A	but over here if you were a I dunno like
A	you know? and like if you weren't from a foreign country that'd be so difficult
B	yeah
A	like you'd have to know
B	you always manage somehow you you either show them a map or
A	yeah
B	say the place name they figure out what you're trying to do
A	yeah
B	like in Asia or somewhere like that
A	yeah and like as well like when their alphabet's different
B	so
A	cos you'd be like
B	in Europe you can see and say have an idea of some place name
A	you'd
B	yeah
A	like I need to get to Tokyo
B	well yeah
A	you'd be like well oh I mean in Japan like they would like in the main like Tokyo they would have the English probably
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that
A	yeah
B	you'd be like well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think
B	yeah and it'll only be like in big cities where they'll have something for the tourists
A	yeah
B	once you go out
A	I know I don't know
B	yeah
A	there is a little bit
B	when you go from one end to I mean in in
A	oh right yeah
B	the architecture
A	yeah
B	when you're going
A	yeah
B	you're really
A	yeah
B	because you're travelling down you know it's the difference whereas
A	here it's just like
B	here cos it's green everywhere isn't it it's all green this country? whereas when you head further south in
A	yeah you know right? cos I mean like in the heatwave that we've had it's been like
B	yeah
A	than up north right I know it's about five degree
B	yeah so there is erm
