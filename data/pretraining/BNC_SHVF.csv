A	so what would be your favourite pet if you could have any?
B	a red panda
A	really?
B	yeah
A	they were very cute weren't they?
B	yeah
A	do you think though they might be quite vicious?
B	erm
A	yeah?
B	yeah so that's why I'd keep them outside
B	mm mm
A	do you think anybody keeps them?
B	erm yeah there are people
A	they're from China
B	mm mm in the mountains
A	eh yeah so do you think they'd need trees though to live on?
B	yeah I'd get trees
A	the red panda is territorial it says but it's solitary and they're quiet except for some twittering and tweeting and whistling
B	also it it's erm a carnivorous herbivore or a
A	I think carnivorous
B	carnivorous herbivore
A	so you'd have to feed it like live mice and things
B	cos it eats it eats both it prefers bamboo and berries and things
A	yeah
B	but it does eat smaller animals from time to time
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	any other pets you might like to keep?
B	no what about you?
A	erm well I always wanted to have a horse when I was young
B	mm mm
A	would you ever have a horse?
B	no
A	why not?
B	erm I don't think I would like to care for it that long cos I don't I don't think it would be worth all the effort cos horses are cool and all but I don't think it would be cool for that long
A	mm
B	that's my opinion
A	yeah but do you like riding horses?
B	never rode a horse
A	have you? I'm sure you have maybe you've had a gone on a donkey with me I mean not with me just on your own
A	yeah maybe when you were three
B	I would love a dog but I would like erm a particular type of dog
A	what kind of dog?
B	mm can't remember exactly
A	yeah
B	oh yeah a Malamute
A	a Malamute?
B	yeah
A	is it like a as big as a Husky? or is it smaller?
B	it's as big as a Husky
A	mm
B	they're quite big and furry and they're friendly
A	yeah
B	which is why I'd like one
A	suppose no I suppose we've got a big garden you'd need a big garden actually we have you'd need to walk it every day do you think you'd actually do that?
B	I think I would
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm okay
B	no yeah
A	that was a little bit like a Husky well kind of
B	no
A	no? not at all?
B	no
A	it was kind of furry
B	doesn't mean it's a Husky
A	I said it just looked like one I didn't say it was one
B	okay cos Huskies are really big and they kind of look like wolves but
A	well you know Collies?
B	yeah
A	is it is it like a mix of loads of things probably but mostly Collie and Alsatian so it made it a kind of a bit kind of pointed face goldeny fur but quite fluffy fur like a Husky with like quite fluffy and medium sized
B	mm mm
A	so quite cute really they're very loyal aren't they? dogs
B	yeah some dogs most times
A	all dogs are loyal aren't they? if you treat them right
B	I don't think they're all loyal
A	no? I thought I thought it was kind of in their nature to be loyal?
B	I know most dogs but I'm pretty sure there's some breeds of dogs that aren't particularly loyal
A	really?
B	I don't know I don't think it's possible that every breed of dog can be loyal
A	mm
B	like every breed of human's not the same every breed of human has different traits
A	aha
B	so it could be the same for a dog
A	could be I suppose do you like cats? I had a cat as well called
B	yeah
A	yeah? what kind of cat would you have?
B	I don't know fluffy cat
A	a fluffy one?
B	yeah
A	mine was erm a tabby and it was kind of medium fluffy but not really really fluffy like would you have one of those with the long haired one?
B	erm I would
A	yeah my cat when I was ill one day when I was about I must have been about six or something because we'd moved from
A	I know they can be so sweet and then one day I don't know what happened to her she was just gone and when we moved to
B	no
A	there's a story when I was young you think you're small I was really small
B	mm mm
A	for my age
B	yeah but you're a girl
A	genuinely very small
B	you're a girl
A	okay alright I wasn't like
B	mm mm
A	she used to have a stray come to her stray cat come to her door all the time and she used to feed it sometimes but she didn't realise it she was pregnant
B	mm mm
A	and one day she came and she obviously because she was she had no home or anything but she erm she came to the door and then came in the house and and went behind the washing machine and had kittens
B	mm mm
A	and she just found her one day and erm
B	mm mm
A	without chopping the whole thing down and nobody could get behind it apart from me cos I was so small so I had to go behind this like
B	mm mm
A	and then I was doing it for ages and ages and ages and we were just thinking of giving up as I just couldn't do it all the time and then one little kitten came out
B	so you liked having a pet?
A	yeah I really liked having a pet yeah it was really nice
B	there are many pets that we can have that they wouldn't mind if we
B	cats for one they are very they are very cool and chilled
A	mm mm
B	so
A	yeah
B	so if we just send someone to like feed them
A	mm mm
B	then they'll be fine
A	yep yes
B	so we could have a cat
A	possibly they do poo all over the garden
B	well so do so do things like hedgehogs and rabbits and foxes that go through our garden
A	yeah I haven't seen the fox for a while do you think it's disappeared now that houses have been built?
B	I don't know maybe
A	yeah I don't know if I did really
B	saw the rabbit and the hedgehog though
A	what happened with the hedgehog one day?
B	it just died
B	yeah
A	and that got buried at the place I didn't know
B	yeah
A	in the garden
A	but yeah I wouldn't mind I suppose I wouldn't mind a pet anyway I quite like cats
B	why don't we get a cat?
A	I don't think
B	what about a hamster? just keep it in my room
A	yeah a
B	yeah it's not like he'd poop all over the garden he's too small you have to
A	you have to do the yeah you'd have to clean out his cage all the time
B	I would
A	yeah
B	no I don't
A	no
B	so much effort so much money spent on a
B	yeah but hamsters
B	and guinea pigs
A	mm
B	they're like you can like pick them up and they're all furry and cute and stuff
A	yeah
B	fishes are weird
A	that's true you can't really stroke them
B	they're cool to look at in like pet shops but
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't have them
A	I know and it is quite a bother every now and again you've got to completely clean out their their erm cage and you've got to keep it at a certain temperature if you want more exotic fish and that kind of thing does seem like a bit of a faff
B	if I found a fish that was really cool like just so cool and just really wanted to have one then yeah
A	mm
B	I would
A	yeah
B	but I doubt I'd get to have it because the only fish that I'd probably really like probably wouldn't look like a a basic fish and would probably cost a lot of money
A	yeah I suppose so
B	okay
A	I promise if I win the lottery
B	you don't even enter the lottery
A	erm I could buy a ticket today? do you want any chocolate mousse?
B	mm?
A	do you want some chocolate mousse when we go out shopping?
B	okay
A	I mean not today but just just
B	yeah
A	it's this Saturday isn't it? the
A	what? you mean you need to get it off Amazon? cos we need to order it now I don't know if it'll arrive on time is it is it a lot more money than the shop is it?
B	erm
A	okay
B	if you look up if you look up Amazon or Nintendo you can compare the prices and then you can look at GameStop GameStop Amazon and Nintendo to
A	but what what's it called?
B	erm okay first place there's Nintendo N I N T E N D O
A	yeah but then what is it?
B	then then there's shop Nintendo shop
A	no but what is the thing you want?
B	oh Amiibo
A	how do you spell that?
B	A M I I B O
A	okay so how much is it usually do you think?
B	erm about fifteen twenty euros
A	I don't think let me just put this in
B	are you sure?
A	yeah I looked didn't they?
B	mm they did
A	yeah maybe they did but it didn't
B	I did Laser Quest in
A	did you? maybe they've stopped it then I just couldn't find it
B	you can type in Amiibo on Amazon Nintendo sell it erm but that might be a bit overpriced but erm
A	so if they we assume they haven't got Laser Quest
B	no I don't really like roller skating
A	unless you want to
B	so you can just click on one of those
A	unless you want to go erm
B	he has that one
A	erm to just do the same thing go to the cinema and go to McDonald's
B	okay I don't like McDonald's somewhere else possibly
A	well I mean
B	erm
A	Domino's Pizza doesn't have they got one in
B	yeah they've got one you've got Domino's Pizza before many times and then you can just click find a retailer at the bottom
A	I did nothing happened
B	oh well then just type in Amazon then
A	okay
B	mm
A	Domino's isn't that? that's a lot of money for people isn't it? if we go to McDonald's then at least it's affordable for people
A	there's one like for ten pounds there's one for ten pound fifty
B	he has Yoshi I don't think he has Mario it's just the one for ten pounds
A	erm
B	what? or GameStop
A	okay
B	Smyths' going to be very overpriced
A	they're all fifteen euros okay?
B	yeah
A	and then erm gamestore GameStop
B	GameStop
B	and you can type in Amiibo
A	it's two Is?
B	mm mm mm if you go down those different Amiibos like
A	they're even more so Smyths we'll just go into Smyths okay?
B	okay
A	and at least you
B	for fifteen still you can get
A	look
B	no
A	no
B	mum you'd like McDonald's anywhere

B	about maybe three that I can get hold of if
A	yeah
B	if he doesn't well then basically he can't come to my party cos he just doesn't bother to use social media at all never bothers to communicate with any of us outside of school
A	yeah
B	it's kind of annoying he only talks in person and then
B	I know where he lives
A	haven't got his address though?

B	erm
A	just put a put a note saying
B	I don't know it's not like
A	it's still A wear isn't it?
B	you'd have to like go up to pay or something and then be like here's this
A	no just say sorry hope you don't mind
B	I don't know if she's working
A	no it's worth a try though
B	first I'll get try and get hold of him on social media cos otherwise it's you know
A	okay
B	too much hassle
A	yeah
B	on this
A	yeah have any of you got the time for this Saturday yet?

A	so what shall we do? okay you start writing it then erm
B	cos I don't have to study anymore
A	yeah okay start writing it
A	you start writing it so it's kind of the same things like yeah erm what time do you think's reasonable for you to wake up
B	erm latest one
A	okay
B	enjoy the day
A	well you have to set like what days you can do computers and things cos otherwise it'll just be every day and it's just too much
B	Tuesday and Thursday still
A	to not do computers?
B	yeah
A	but the other days have to set a limit of time
B	I know
A	you can watch TV for the rest
B	mm this is the last time I'm going to be on my laptop for the whole summer
A	don't know if you should we'll have to talk about that later anyway
B	you said I one of the only reason I got a laptop was so I could transport it around and then I was already kind of sad that I couldn't bring it on
A	okay but
B	this summer's three months
A	okay well yes probably but can we just go through that in another time? right?
B	okay
A	alright
B	generally do what?
A	go on your your laptops
B	laptop
A	laptop
B	mm
A	and that includes like things like looking so basically computer game it includes Xbox and DS
B	am I allowed to watch things that I can't watch just on normal TV Netflix or anime?
A	erm
A	yeah but erm well you make sure you do it though cos sometimes you're sort of sat there and you've got to do it in a way that you're not just sat on a bed crouched over cos it's really bad for your posture as well
B	okay so what? what posture shall I use?
B	okay so outside my bed?
A	mm mm
B	yeah okay
A	okay
B	yeah but erm only one thing one thing that I ask is erm like
A	what is it?
B	it's called Naruto
A	what is Naruto?
B	it's a Japanese show it's like
A	but is it violent?
B	no not really
A	what do you mean not really?
B	kind of it's about these kids and they're ninjas
A	yeah
B	it's appropriate for most ages like seven and up
A	yeah
B	kind of there is a tiny bit of blood occasionally but that's only occasionally
A	yeah
B	and it's even then it's cartoon blood
A	okay and do the girls watch it as well then?
B	erm they don't watch this one no but they have watched other animes like
A	yeah yeah
B	oh yeah erm
A	does she?
B	yeah she's on episode a hundred
A	oh
B	she stopped watching it
A	are you saying it's better in your room? is that what you're trying to?
B	no I'm just saying that you can only watch it on a laptop
A	yeah
B	because it's not on Netflix
A	yeah
B	and it needs it needs something that my laptop has called Flash
A	yeah
B	do you know what Flash is?
A	yeah
B	yeah it needs that and my Ipad doesn't have it
A	no the Ipads don't have it do they?
B	so can I watch that?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	that's okay
B	if you want you can watch an episode of it?
A	okay yeah I've got to try and keep up to date with some of the things you're in cos I don't really know some bits
B	if you just
A	yeah
B	the main guy's Naruto?
A	yeah
B	least I can
A	we could say like for you know? for June the thirteenth you could say two o' clock like meet in McDonald's or something then go a bit later or just at the minute
A	some days we'll just go out like you and me just do stuff
B	like what?
A	I don't know I'll just say it's a nice day today let's go out and we'll you'll just have to come out with us and not moan
A	I've no idea
B	are they here today?
A	no
B	why? where are they gone?
A	back to their mum
B	did they leave yesterday?
A	yeah mm
A	you not notice?
B	no
A	yeah they've gone back to their mum's
B	alright can we erm play a board game? you me and
A	I can I can say me I don't know if
B	cos there's I don't know cos there's many board games that are very good like Monopoly Scrabble
A	love playing Scrabble
B	erm
A	erm Monopoly's
B	yeah
A	we'll have to do something that I can do probably with you in in the daytime cos
B	okay when does my gymnastics start? ten to five is it?
A	no it's five thirty isn't it?
B	I don't know
A	well you should remember five thirty and it finishes at quarter to seven and I should be able to get my ticket this time for your your show
B	yeah
A	cos I didn't get it but we missed it last week
B	missed the show?
A	no we missed gymnastics
B	oh yeah yeah I know you were gone no it it was that I had to go out of with
A	yeah we were out with
B	you forgot? I didn't forget
A	didn't you?
B	no
A	see you could have reminded me and I I would have been okay about taking you with
B	school wasn't finished then
A	mm?
B	school wasn't finished then
A	it was nearly finished it was like it was just exams so
B	yeah
A	yeah I just
B	I'm not going to be able to do this thing
A	what thing?
B	the erm
A	the show?
B	yeah
A	they should be giving you like really not so talented things to you should be able to be part of the show and not do that it's just kind of silly
B	I kind of joined late as well
A	yeah I mean you were like years behind most of them
B	mm mm
A	so I wouldn't feel bad about not being able to do this stuff
B	erm
A	what do you mean uncomfortable?
B	I'm not looking forward to it
A	no?
B	no
A	why? because you can't do everything?
B	I'm pretty sure that it's just beneficial for them don't really think it's beneficial for me
A	well you
B	basically basically but it is
A	but but just don't don't do all the stuff that you need
B	but it is for them
A	yeah
B	is it just they show their parents what they've taught their kids?
A	yeah
B	which is actually kind of untrue cos a lot of the stuff they didn't even teach us
A	yeah
B	and we're very mixed very mixed I don't know half the stuff and some people know way more than they should
A	some people? oh oh
B	there's this girl that can do there's this girl that can do a double handspin then into a backflip and she does it in the show
A	yeah
B	like this is the part where we have to do a round of back
A	mm mm
B	and then what she does she does a rounder two backhand springs and she does a backflip
A	well but that's that's okay you're always going to be behind some of these people that's alright isn't it?
B	yeah but the group is very more much more advanced than me
A	oh no but I don't think that's a reason not to get stuck in
A	cos it's boys
B	okay
A	that's why no other reason
