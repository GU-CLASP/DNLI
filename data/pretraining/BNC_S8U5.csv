B	because the thing is like she
A	yeah
B	issue my coursework my biology coursework I've had her for a year
A	yeah
B	she spells it with
A	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and you know what? you know what's even worse?
B	on the front title page
A	oh my god
B	she misspelt my name my name is right there
A	wow
B	I don't know what ah
A	wow
B	she's odd though she's very odd
A	what if that messes it up for like registering your coursework or something cos it's like not the same name or something?
B	I don't know she's just odd she's very odd
A	yeah I know I kind of liked her teaching style but then
B	it's not as much as that it's like
A	that's how I feel with
B	she can just like you know how like
A	yeah
B	she'll just like explode and then like come back to normal and then just explode
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and then she won't tell them to be quiet she'll it's like she doesn't know how to speak English
B	she's like can you shush shush she doesn't ever ask them can you please be quiet?
A	yeah
B	she just goes straight in with indescribable words
A	it's really awkward yeah
B	and she's really you know and like
A	I left my bike
B	you
B	let's go back
A	do you do you wanna go? and then I'll get my bike ah
B	your bike
A	wow
B	have you named your bike?
A	I used to but I haven't name this one
B	if you if you get a car would you name your car?
A	probably yeah cos cars are more like
B	personal
A	they're bigger they're more symbolic I guess
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	have you named your house?
A	I did before I don't remember what I called it
B	did you name your house a human name?
A	yeah
B	I don't know like the den or
A	the den
B	yeah something like that
A	the den yeah
B	not human but like
A	that's a horrible name
B	yeah it's not a very good name
A	yeah I know human names make it more fun
B	I don't know
A	cos I it kind of like it's like
B	I don't I don't know I think it's just like
A	yeah yeah that would be fine
B	yeah and that's it
A	and I I assumed
B	I'm so awkward around
A	I'm awkward around
B	are you?
A	yeah cos I'm not friends with him
B	yeah I'm not friends with him either
A	like it wasn't like erm
B	yeah
A	then like
B	yeah?
A	and then he didn't invite me to his or something like something like that
B	oh
A	this was in like year nine or ten
B	okay
A	and then and then it was just
B	yeah
A	and then I was just like oh wait
B	ah
A	a little bit awkward no it wasn't like I was sad I was it was just kinda like
B	it sounds so oh
A	and then then it was just like oh
B	mm
A	even though they weren't and then
B	yeah
A	and then like
B	does he?
A	he said to me yeah
B	he said that to you? that's so
A	yeah he he messaged it through the other day it was like erm
B	yeah
A	and then he was saying oh
B	but does he know that?
A	yeah but he he he doesn't really get it he's kind of annoyed by it and he was asking if I could like get something back to him I dunno it was a letter or something or if I could check and then he was like oh erm
B	I thought you
A	or line manager I said he should call me
B	that's so awkward
A	yeah I know and then
B	yeah
A	that's what being in this position involved
B	yeah
A	and then the moment we tried to help him with that you know we're like okay that's fine we need to try and find ways to you know
B	yeah
A	then you know he goes on the reverse cos like if you like compliment him he feels as though
B	oh
A	so then then when we sort of approached it and we we told him how amazing he'd been cos he had been
B	unusual
A	yeah
B	I think it's what I feel like because like I'm very quiet if I don't know people
A	yeah
B	and it's just gonna be
A	four of us?
B	yeah
A	yeah I know it'll be fun when we I go back to my house I mean I'd rather
B	then there's more people and I know most of them
A	yeah
B	I never see all of them except for
A	who don't you know?
A	yeah
B	not
A	yeah
A	but you don't totally hate him
B	can't believe him
B	and he went like zero to one hundred really quick
A	yeah I know I know I know
B	he was so serious
A	I actually never now like whenever they're next to each other I notice
B	yeah
B	the thing is they've always had like they always had like
A	yeah I know
B	I don't get it
A	yeah
B	but like now I remember like one time I hung out with them
A	uhu
B	and we went to the high street and
A	oh really?
B	not because like they were
A	yeah
B	but like
A	yeah I know
B	yeah it's still one way
A	maybe it's not but
B	no I think it's one way
A	yeah it's just like
B	it's so
A	it was funny though it it
B	it's bullshit
A	yeah I know
B	it's not depth
A	but he's accepted it like
B	the thing is not everyone
A	yeah exactly
B	how
A	as in like
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	well did
A	yeah I mean like I wasn't expecting her to like I don't know
B	how did she react when you asked her?
A	she was like so fucking indifferent about it like the way
B	oh right
A	yeah I know I know I'm not expecting her to fucking jump up and down but like
A	when I told her it was just like oh okay like as if she
A	yeah I know I like I don't know I I didn't expect a response but something
A	it was just like
B	yeah that's cool
A	and er I think everyone's gonna drink a little bit so
A	who? what?
A	what?
B	I don't know
A	what like fucking?
B	no not I don't know just like aggressive public displays of affection
A	excuse my language
B	yeah yes yes I remember that
A	I remember that it was like
B	I remember that I remember that
B	and he was right next to them and they were just like going
A	yeah yeah yeah I know
B	doing their thing
A	and it was like a horror was it a horror movie?
B	no it was Mockingjay
A	mocking yeah

B	yeah
A	the final one
B	and they
A	no?
B	no
A	I don't know it looks kind of fun
B	do you remember where she just like basically killed everyone in that hospital?
B	yeah she acted like it was like not her fault
B	cos like no one was there and could like hold her responsible
A	and they used it for propaganda like it was the enemy ah god
B	have you seen the other movies?
A	I watched the first one and then
B	I've seen the first one and I've seen part one that's it
A	okay yeah so I'm the same
B	the thing is I've read the books
A	oh okay yeah yeah

A	oh jesus
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	oh okay

A	yeah? I see
B	like I'm just concerned that they'll just start going at it I don't know
A	I don't think so I think that er I think er
B	their their inhibitions are down they
A	yeah I know I'm thinking that alcohol might have an effect on that I don't know how drunk they've been together but
B	I mean
A	but dude it's a really tiny room yeah
A	like like we're not
B	they're just gonna be squishing around on the wall
A	yeah basically
B	or they could just like go outside he's like oh I need to pee and she's like oh yeah I need to pee too
A	I need a pee too
B	and then they just go go at it outside
A	damn it
B	there's
A	yeah
B	I don't know what
A	we just need to get
A	yeah that's good that's good I know I was telling you like no you know what he said to me? he was like erm

A	I think everyone's staying over
B	even
A	er I haven't heard back from her yet but probably
B	well how how are we gonna sleep? what are the sleeping arrangements?
A	I didn't think we were gonna sleep
B	we're not gonna sleep at all?
A	my dad my dad assumed I was gonna sleep and I was like no we're not actually going to sleep
B	cos I don't know how it
A	like there there's gonna be a bed and there's two sofas that are gonna be there so somebody can sleep if they want
B	okay
A	but I don't I don't I don't

A	like fucking
B	yeah
A	I'm going to stay up all night
A	like twenty minutes it wasn't even
B	I love it
A	we picked the film cos he liked it but
B	I love it when you and
B	uhu
A	maybe we should have
B	ah
A	but yeah like
B	yeah
A	erm other than obviously
B	yeah
A	obviously if they're buying a gift then that's alright but
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah yeah no no everyone
A	at the moment there's like twelve people
B	everyone should pay for it yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I remember being at
B	mm mm
A	and like when I started doing it I was like fucked like one shot for like sixteen people is a whole bottle
B	woah
A	and you think you're gonna do like ten shots that's like ten bottles it's like holy shit that's a lot
B	but do you know how much stuff you're buying?
A	erm
B	oh shit
A	that laughter like I had to force that a bit
B	I like it when you do fake laughs though
A	no no it's like usually I instinctively laugh when people fall over
B	like when that old woman
A	yeah I know I know when anyone trips I'm just like oh god
B	oh her mum
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	she comes comes in halfway through the night got my six bottles
B	ah
A	but then
B	ah
A	this was last night though like but I was hoping she'd forget about it you know
B	is
A	er erm
B	have you asked him?
A	no
B	make sure you ask him cos otherwise he's not going to remember to do it
A	okay
B	is he? ah
A	yeah
B	alcoholic cakes?
A	I know like whisky brownies or syrup cupcakes or something
B	is it him who can't have eggs?
A	no no it was a lie
B	it was a lie?
A	erm
B	yeah?
A	he's become more immune each time until eventually he could just eat an omelette
B	he had a he lied he had a nut allergy?
B	yeah
A	the way I see it
B	are you sure that's how biology works?
B	oh erm
A	Bruce
B	Bruce
A	erm
B	Bruce Willis
A	Bruce Willis
B	Bear Grylls
A	Bear Grylls yeah erm
B	yeah
A	I
B	that's not even Bear Grylls that's bullshit
A	that's what I thought that's like no cos you know you hear these stories of people injecting themselves with like snake venom to like make themselves immune
B	I've never heard those stories
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's true it's true it's true
B	wait is
A	yeah to the party as well
B	Montenegro?
A	if that's alright with you?
B	she did?
A	she said she hadn't paid the deposit when Miss
B	but she is coming?
A	oh wait no no no hang on hang on I take that back what you know what I said was true but she said
B	because she was asking me and
A	yeah
B	where we were gonna stay in Montenegro so I was like
B	what?
A	she hasn't got a letter then probably cos that was all on the letters
B	oh yeah it was yeah so she hasn't got a letter
A	maybe you know
B	ah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's not gonna disrupt her entire experience hopefully
B	the year twelves are so shit
A	yeah
B	no I haven't been in their class
A	from what I've heard and seen of them
B	no I mean I mean just the way that they behave like they've got no squares so we can't eat through them any more
A	oh the whole year
B	and that the
A	we all we knew this was gonna happen
B	you can yeah you can
A	yeah exactly
B	is it is it that
A	I don't know I think they do
B	the year above us did shit
A	yeah
B	but as soon as they went nothing happened nothing ever happened
A	yeah
B	so it could have just been that we're a nice year but it could also be that
A	yeah I know I know we're so like biased though from our from our perspective but
B	yeah
A	like I
B	oh our year's nice
A	just like
B	like basically like you know how the the doors of the bathroom and the boys' bathrooms always come off
A	yeah that's never us
B	that never happened as soon as they left
A	I know
B	oh was it?
A	have them yeah they brought screwdrivers in just to fuck with it
B	why?
A	cos I don't know
B	why is it funny to take
A	cos like they they don't like the school and they wanna vandalise it
B	there are smarter things you can do probably
A	I know I know
B	yeah
A	like so
B	who is gonna be the head boy?
A	do you know
B	his name sounds very familiar
B	does
A	yeah
B	yeah I know him
A	erm
B	yeah
A	I just know him as a really he's a well behaved kid and he gets involved with a lot of stuff
B	mm mm
A	but they both behave really badly and then whenever I see them with their friends they're just like
B	yeah
A	like he was quite badly behaved but they still had him as assistant head boy so I could see like
B	do they do the same thing as last year?
A	what for recruitment?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh really?
A	with the sole purpose of encouraging literacy in the school
B	but er
A	erm
B	why?
A	pushed for it it's like
B	but why would you have that? the thing is like something like careers as well it's too specific for us to have enough to do
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so it's like and they they work with the librarian a lot
B	so two very specific things which aren't at all related
A	yeah
B	you've combined them
A	yeah I know
B	into one role
A	I know
B	which is going to be even harder to do cos like now you have nothing to do
A	but we think like it might make it easier because it's like bringing the team closer
B	true
A	erm whereas
B	I have to be with
A	oh no
B	I don't even know where I'm going I don't know
A	I thought it was gonna be like specific revision it's literally just giving tips and stuff
B	yeah I don't know
B	I don't
A	what?
B	about the
A	what about?
B	he's a fifty-year-old man
A	oh right I see
B	she doesn't know?
A	oh that was
