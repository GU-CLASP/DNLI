B	probably
C	yeah is
A	not
B	yeah it's that way
A	not far away
B	yeah
C	yeah that's where the offices are so that's where they live that sort of way
B	but people aren't gonna be able to come from all over the country if they're all working the following day surely
A	what day is it on?
B	they won't be able to stay late
C	Sunday
A	Sunday oh right so yeah
B	well they work every day so
A	every day of the year yeah
B	you know you can't have one when you're not but
C	no no no so Sunday and obviously with it being a bank holiday we're not open till ten the next day anyway
B	oh right oh I see
C	so that's why they've done it because there is leeway and then Sundays on Sunday they're letting erm
B	right
C	so a lot of stores are closing at three o'clock on Sunday
B	oh okay are you?
C	we're not
B	you're not?
C	we're staying open till five
B	oh how come?
B	is everybody from your store going?
C	a few of them are because they've got work on Monday but I said I'm I've put myself in at half past eight on Monday morning to prove my point because they're all moaning
B	but you don't open till ten?
C	no
B	oh
C	but we start at half eight anyway but
B	right
C	you know it'll be fine for the I'll I'll be fine anyway but that's why a lot of them aren't going but if they're not going now then they have to write a letter of apology
B	do you know how many people will go to the whole thing? do you know how many have even been invited how many?
C	well if there's twenty
A	er
C	no this is just
B	so it's mm
C	I was just working out as
B	twenty times twelve? two hundred and forty
C	so that's two hundred and forty just from
B	uhu
C	and then all the
B	where where's the venue for this?
C	somewhere in
B	what a hotel or?
C	er no it's like a rugby club
B	okay
C	er I think they do it every two years
B	every two years?
C	mm but yeah no erm I spoke to the
B	yeah
C	times and they says you can do that however erm if you do do that and we do get complaints cos people have made a special effort
B	mm
C	to come to the
A	yeah
C	at half past four and
B	yeah
C	you're shut at
B	yeah
C	four o'clock you know they've still got that half an hour they think
B	yeah
C	then we'll be sending all the complaints directly to you and we won't be dealing with any of them so I said no
B	yeah well that's fair enough cos
C	and there's a hell of a lot of people to tell really isn't there?
B	oh absolutely yeah mm
C	well we're in
B	so will your work till five or till four?
C	I dunno but I'm gonna I don't know yeah maybe till four
B	yeah especially if you're gonna go in at half eight in the morning let somebody else lock up
C	well yeah yeah yeah yeah well
A	yes
B	and then are you gonna go straight to the to
C	if I was to go
A	you'd be halfway there wouldn't you?
C	yeah
A	well you're in the centre of
B	cos the
C	cos my days off ideally this week were gonna be Thursday and Sunday
B	yeah
C	however on Sunday now there's only like eight of them working it's pay weekend and it's we've got a promotion we've got an
B	mm
C	for what we're got on but they probably will deal okay if I'm not there but I dunno whether I should be there that's what I'm trying to
B	well you could stay till five and just get
C	yeah
C	no and I
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	cos I I don't I don't have to be there at ten o'clock that day do you?
B	no
C	cos I'm just gonna go as an extra person I think
B	well take take the train and then erm and work till five and then get your outfit on and meet
C	mm
B	go from there
C	yeah I'm not bothered about doing
B	it's probably the easiest thing to do
A	is
C	who Mr
A	no no the
C	oh
C	er yeah
A	right okay
C	well you get a plus one so I just said to
A	yes yeah fair enough
B	and does he?
C	I think so yeah we haven't actually said yes he's going but I think
B	free food and drink I imagine he's on it
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	knowing
C	like so then we've got the flexibility to you know
A	go away when you want
C	go away when I want to
A	yes
B	did you book your holiday? you said
C	yeah I have asked her for it
B	September?
C	yeah and I have wrote it down on the calendar now she didn't say yes or no she was like oh New York so yes
B	who was that?
C	yeah so I will just write a note and give it her or I'll just send her something to say this is the week that I have booked off just a you know
B	yeah
C	yeah so that's good
B	and was
C	yeah he was gonna do that
A	good
A	that's nice exciting
C	yes extremely exciting
A	yeah
C	just need to book some
A	the the two bedroom one?
C	yeah
A	well that was the best of the two it was only that was only a selection of two
C	yeah that was the two that we'd narrowed it down to
A	oh anyway?
B	where is it? where's it based? did you know?
C	Manhattan
B	yeah?
C	they're both very central on that map anyway they were both
B	uhu and they're er apartments?
C	so
A	yeah
C	yeah so the one had the view but it only had the one bedroom and one single bed
B	yeah
C	but there was a pullout bed in that single bed room so that could be like two beds in there
B	yeah
C	and then there was the sofa bed so again that's two
B	yeah
C	beds in there and it had a really nice view but I think like dad said if we'd have just been paying we'd have to like tidy up in the morning it's not like a bedroom that you can just quickly get ready the
B	what did the other one have then?
C	two bedrooms
A	slightly more expensive the two bedroom one
C	yes
A	but only by about
C	hundred quid?
A	ten ten pound a night
C	oh was it? yeah actually yeah I think it was nine or ten
A	or five pound a night or something
C	yeah so it had two bedrooms a nice kitchen
B	uhu
A	there wasn't a view from there though
C	no no no no that was literally just looked I think it looked out onto a it looked to me like a just a street
B	I don't think we'd be expecting a view though
C	no and to be honest I think
A	you'd pay for a lot for one
C	yeah this one's
A	a nice view
C	very new very modern
B	one
C	one bathroom yeah very new very modern well didn't it?
A	yeah it was nice yeah
B	yeah and how much was that a night?
A	two forty or something?
C	two yeah two three I think
B	which would split four ways?
A	between four yeah
C	er overall I think
B	so
C	with the fees and everything fee sorry it was one one was it one thousand one hundred? I think it was one thousand
A	I didn't see the total price
B	for the
A	I saw the
C	for the four nights with the fees
B	so yeah two hundred and sixty quid each
C	yeah
A	yeah for
B	and the flights were just under four hundred?
C	I think so yeah yeah three hundred and eighty yeah
B	so six so six fifty ish at the moment we're up to that's alright isn't it?
C	yeah and then like you say when we get there at the airport and stuff we'll just get erm
B	subway?
C	the subway is that what it's called?
B	that's what the underground's called yeah
C	yeah
A	subway
C	we'll just get the subway
B	interesting what
A	they only travel one way on
B	if you go down
A	the
B	the subway you can't get to the other side of the line so you have to know which way you're going
C	oh when you're on top?
B	cos the yeah so cos the the trains follow the traffic
B	yeah? so if you wanna go that way you know you'd have to get on that side of the road and not that side of the road cos once you go down
C	oh
B	you can't swap to go the other way
C	oh okay
A	they like go one way well as long as well it's a one-way system then
C	yeah
B	so you'd have to cross the road and you'd have to go you'd
C	down that way to go that way
A	right
C	mm interesting
B	yes I thought that which is something
A	mm
B	you wouldn't know unless you'd done it but I suppose once you know it then
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	straightforward
A	yeah
C	a lot of things should be walking distance as well shouldn't they?
B	uhu
A	network map the they show you the roads they're all
C	yeah
A	all straight and in blocks
B	that's how the Americans do everything
A	yes very organised it's no bends in the roads it's just straight
C	it's straight yeah
B	gotta decide on
A	it's a bid odd looking actually
B	on a Broadway show
A	yeah
C	will all different be shows be on all the time? or
B	yeah there'll be a wide variety I dunno not every single show
A	it's like London I suppose lots of different theatres and
C	will it be the same sort of thing as London? it will won't it?
B	yeah like the West End yeah small theatres they won't be big like the Hippodrome
C	no
A	it is
C	just cos it's iconic to do in er in New York?
B	I love shows anyway so you don't have to come to one obviously if you don't want to just sort of
C	yeah no no no I'm just wondering why
B	well it's
C	yeah well
B	yeah
C	and it is quite an iconic thing to do isn't it in New York? watch a show on Broadway
A	on Broadway on that's right
C	yeah I saw a Broadway street on the map the other day
B	I'd like to see one I've not seen before I haven't
C	yeah
B	cos I'd I'd choose Cats maybe if it was on
C	well if that's on why don't you see that?
B	yeah
C	you can do
B	have you seen Phantom?
C	mm no I don't think so have we seen it?
B	no I don't think I took you I saw I years ago before I used to take you to shows
C	oh okay no I've not seen that
B	mm
C	good?
B	yeah just seen it the once that was fine
C	yeah yeah no it'll be good won't it?
A	yeah
B	things like Wicked are on but I've seen that one twice so I don't wanna see that one again
C	yeah no
B	I've seen Les Mis about three or four times
C	I've got that one
B	Jersey Boys is on well we've seen that one we went to London with nanna at one Christmas do you remember?
C	I remember Jersey Boys
B	I don't
C	erm I
B	it wasn't
C	didn't really get into it really
B	no I don't no
C	no
B	it wasn't your sort of music I liked it
A	Four Seasons music that isn't it? very very good
B	it was mm cool
C	just need to decide on what else we want to do don't we?
A	do a bit of searching before we go see what's on
C	uhu
A	and what's there to see
C	yeah
A	and where they are in relation to where we are do do a bit of map do this this day that the other
C	uhu four full days'll be a lot though won't it? it'll be plenty
A	that should fill it
B	I think it'll be erm enough I think we'll have plenty to do even if you just decide to go shopping
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	fill your rucksack up
C	I wonder how much money we'll spend
B	depends how much shopping you do
C	yeah
B	it won't be cheap
C	well it's
B	there
C	the combination I'd like to do there that's the most expensive surely
B	oh I dunno you might spend more on food you and
C	mm
B	for four days it depends if you want three meals a day
C	no well I was saying again this is good with the Aibnb isn't it? get some cereal in
B	yes yeah
C	erm toast cereal for the morning so that's breakfast then isn't it? and then you have the like you say you have cups of coffee and tea before you go out don't you so you don't have to buy them when you're out
B	well though I think stuff like that would could be cheap
C	you what sorry?
B	things coffee'll be cheap it'll be the food I don't think
C	yeah
B	a lot of the food'll be fairly cheap you er it depends if you eat in the fast food restaurants and things like that I suppose what you wanna eat
C	yeah
B	it's good to get recommendations off anybody if any particular good places otherwise it's like any big city and you'll end up anywhere or
C	yeah
A	Gordon Ramsay? no he's
B	no
A	he's big in America isn't he?
C	oh okay
A	well he's er
C	I'm sure she said
A	and his style
C	somebody told her to go there
B	oh
C	I dunno if she
B	well again you could google the the best restaurants in New York and see
C	yeah we can do that
B	but we don't we only want erm you know one or two decent meals cos then it's money again isn't it you're spending
C	yeah
A	lucky with the rain then
C	yes dad
A	did you have a brolly?
C	it no
A	oh did you have a hood?
C	yes but my hood doesn't work very well
A	what do
C	mm it's only very thin it doesn't actually protect the head
A	it's probably showerproof though is it? oh it doesn't go over your head?
C	well it does but it's very it's a very thin one and you know when they flap and you still get all rain on you?
B	does it make your hair go flat?
C	mm my hair's already
B	straight
C	already straight yeah no it was raining in
A	and we had we've had before you phoned there was quite a shower
C	yeah?
A	but er it's been like that all day off and on
C	has it?
A	shower
C	have you been at work?
A	I only went to a meeting at lunchtime
C	mm
B	and what did you do at your meeting?
A	well just in fact they'd started without me
B	why?
A	they'd been they they'd they'd had a some of them had been to a a seminar which I didn't wanna go to and er erm the the the meeting had been put back which is why I went in late
C	yeah
A	and er
B	mm
B	I thought that you had individual meetings it's a group meeting?
A	yeah
B	oh was
C	how many people in there?
A	erm six of us seven or something
C	oh okay
A	five reps and then of which I'm one of the two of the office staff
B	and what do they talk about?
A	erm events last week any coming upcoming and forthcoming events
C	sales meaning how many people you get signed up?
A	yeah yeah pretty much erm but it's all a bit hit and miss because erm
C	yeah
A	and they er
C	they don't they
A	it's easy to get to and it's not outside and wet and
C	yeah
A	so it's not really you know you need to go there or we need to do this it's
C	mm
A	very relaxed
C	yeah
B	was the guy there who's in charge of the fundraising that other job that was up?
A	no he doesn't he's in a different section to us but he's only I I dunno I've bumped into him a couple of times since er I spoke to him on the phone just to say hello and er show my face and so on
B	and any prospects of any work with him or not?
A	erm
B	oh I thought I thought you did I thought you said it was something that you wanted to do and he said he was looking for full time but he would consider you for part time
A	this this job he wants erm er well presumably he I dunno whether he's employed anybody yet cos there's nobody in the office I'd
B	oh oh I didn't realise that I thought it was
A	yeah but
B	something they were just looking at imminently
A	there is there is a the job is full now he wants full time and I'm I don't want to do I don't want to do full time
C	yeah fair enough do you still get the most people signed up?
A	I don't know how how many anybody gets really they just er they don't give us any numbers any more they haven't for ages
C	no?
A	no so I don't really know
C	still do that
A	well there's the chap who works full time so I think he gets the most
C	right okay
A	but he said that's a high week for him he's he's on but he's on
C	full time

C	pizza places in the backstreets you could get some
A	right
C	really good food but one night we wanted to eat you know by the water
B	yeah
C	so we could see the gondolas
A	yeah
C	cos it was lovely
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah well that's what you pay for then
C	but the food was awful
B	oh
C	the food was dreadful and it was so expensive and we're talking about
B	they know they've got the venue
C	three three times the price of
B	yeah
C	and to be fair it started raining that night as well so that wasn't very good and when it does rain it was it was very smelly
B	mm yeah they say that don't they?
A	oh right
C	because of all the it because it's
B	well is it the?
C	so it's so you feel so claustrophobic and I think that's what I didn't like
B	what was it the place you went to which was nicer?
C	Trieste
B	Trieste
C	yeah that was lovely
B	yeah
C	I loved
B	less touristy
C	loved that yeah
B	mm
C	everything about that was so good
B	did you
C	like it was
B	did you travel by train and bus on those trips or did did you take internal flights?
C	train
B	you didn't do any internal flights? you just flew out and flew back and you
C	yeah
B	mm
C	cos we did the train didn't we from Slovenia?
B	is that where Lake Bled is? Slovenia?
C	yes
A	uhu
C	where did we go first? Ljubljana is that Slovenia?
B	dunno you're the one that's been there
C	we went there first then to Slovenia and Lake Bled and then from Lake Bled we went to Trieste
A	Croatia didn't you go?
C	no I didn't do Croatia
A	okay Armenia?
C	Ljubljana I think that's in
A	okay
C	so we did we did
B	Croatia
C	just do Slovenia and Italy
A	right
C	mm
C	cos we did
A	yeah
C	Ljubljana
A	good
B	only gone for a week was it a week or just over?
C	just over a week I think it was like eight or nine days
B	mm
C	but
B	mm
C	got bikes and went round
B	and did all that swimming
C	and then left all of our stuff on the side and swam to the
A	island
C	so
B	including phones and stuff?
C	yeah
B	out just out in the open?
C	yeah the
B	really?
C	well the we left them in a bag and we
B	oh right okay
C	and put the bag on the bike
B	I see
C	in a big knot
B	yeah and just left it
C	and left it
B	it's good it was still there when you got back
C	I know I dunno why
A	you just do
B	was there anybody else around?
C	there were there were a few
C	there were a few people
A	you
C	going past our bags on bikes
A	you had quick look behind
C	and
B	you couldn't have got back quick though could you?
A	yeah get off my bag you
C	I dunno why I was watching it because like you say there was no it
C	yeah
A	bring my bag back
C	yeah
A	mm
C	then we got there walked round the church in our
C	whatever
B	crazy
A	mm
C	yes and then yeah Venice was erm cos what we'd done is we'd bought a ticket
B	yeah
C	we get on there this guy walks past everyone er he sees us from the other side gets his erm piece of paper out read
B	right
C	however many euro I think it was like fifty euro
B	did you have to pay?
C	and we paid we had to pay it
B	yeah
C	and we tried to explain you know
B	yeah
C	we this is our first time to Venice
B	yeah
C	we've just bought a train ticket we've got on the train thinking
B	yeah
C	that's okay
B	yeah
C	to buy because we'd brought from a man as well behind a screen
B	yeah
C	and we said can we just get a ticket into the into the town or whatever it was?
B	mm
C	and he didn't tell us to validate it there was no signs up anywhere there was nothing to say before you get on the train
A	mm
C	you must validate your ticket
B	bad isn't it?
C	and all it is is you just pop it under some it's like a little hole punch
B	yeah
C	and you put the hole it puts a hole punch
B	yeah
C	in your ticket
B	yeah
C	but again why didn't the guy that served us the ticket do that?
A	who knows?
B	cos you maybe could have used it er on a different day and you just validate it when you travel so you could have bought it for the day after maybe it hadn't got a date on so that's how they that's their system
C	they know what they're doing don't they?
B	well if it hasn't got a date on it you could you know you could use it at any time maybe
C	I don't know now I can't remember if it did or not but
B	mm
C	it was just rather annoying
B	it is yes and you it's a lot of money
C	and you've paid and then you
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh the they had a I don't know whether the ticket was much
A	was it
C	it was only a short
A	like so
C	it was about a ten minute train journey
A	a big fine for?
C	yeah it it was a ten
A	more than the so you might as well just taken the fine and not bought the ticket then
C	yeah it was a ten minute train journey
A	ten minutes?
C	oh yeah it was literally only from
B	but didn't you say loads of people were trying to complain at the other end? or
C	yeah yeah about having them validated but it was only like the
B	uhu
C	and that's where we were going
B	right
A	mm yes
C	so
B	how did you get back? on the train again?
C	no we had a bus
B	oh
C	yeah
A	more straightforward
C	and that bus took us straight to the airport I think
B	you like to try and do things on the cheap don't you? use all the public transports like the locals
C	yeah
A	good
C	as long as you know where you're going
B	I've been sneezing a lot today and yesterday have you started sneezing yet?
C	no
B	with hay fever have you not? mind you you're inside more just cos driving erm into
C	mm mm
B	and I sneezed loads I thought oh it's gotta be hay fever
A	oh right
C	oh dear
B	I haven't had it bad for a few years really so
C	I'm sure I didn't really have it bad last year did I?
B	no I don't think you must have had it bad for a few years and I don't know whether that's just because the pollen's been lower or I don't know
C	touch wood I have had no itchy eyes nothing
B	and I can't remember if we got it worse in May or whether it was later on in June July August
C	I'm sure I always had it
B	mm yeah
C	I'm sure I'm sure mine lasted but I'm sure I always had it this sort of time
B	yeah we got it early yeah
C	and I'm sure it always did last cos it was
B	oh were you? well I wasn't here
C	mm
B	most of last summer June July and
C	when
B	August I wasn't here
C	when was I there? again when did we go to
B	end of April
C	April so I started there in May in
B	right
C	so I've nearly been there a year now
B	mm
C	but yeah the I had it bad there
A	after
C	I remember that
B	yeah
C	I remember talking to you about it I was like how am I getting it? I'm inside it cos I was
B	yeah
C	inside a
B	yeah
C	big complex
B	yeah you were
C	I was nowhere like I was outside
B	must come through all the air con or something or the ventilation system
C	yeah no I do remember that
B	I don't know what if the pollen's high or not at the moment I have I have no idea
A	haven't er usually they report on the weather don't they? they haven't er
C	said anything
A	said anything at the moment
B	no
A	but ad you know the adverts are coming thick and fast now so
C	mm
A	time of the year
C	do you remember I used to the car park in the car park at
A	oh the pub car park yes
C	now they've put the barriers up
A	yeah
A	yeah they got wise to that didn't they
C	yeah
B	probably because of you
C	it lasted a good good
A	but then you only paid two pound a day after that didn't you or something?
C	couple of months wasn't it there?
B	in the pub?
C	in that
B	oh
