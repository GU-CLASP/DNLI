A	oh I hate exercise
B	well I'm not the greatest fan of it
A	you've gotta be you have to be
B	well not really
A	yeah you actually participate in sport by choice that is someone who gets along with it
B	mm true
A	well you can't be an ex-professional footballer and say you don't like exercise oh my god all the fat people would kill you
B	I don't really like exercise I didn't enjoy the fitness part of it
A	yeah but still
B	I just enjoyed the playing football bit
A	that's still enjoying sport
B	okay
A	I haven't got a single thing I enjoy they always said you'll find that one thing and when you connect with it that'll be it and I never found one thing
B	maybe you'll do like dominoes or something
B	yeah
B	great I've got a darts board in my kitchen that I'm good at darts
A	I'm not it's the hand-eye thing that I don't have
B	we we were gonna start a darts team
A	who?
B	erm actually like me and
A	oh wow
B	and then realised we're not forty-five years old
A	well it doesn't stop you all from playing golf
B	true
B	golf's golf's a younger person's game
A	what? I would say if anything
B	no
A	yeah
B	have you seen Rory McIlroy?
A	have you seen
B	no you got a text
A	I know I
A	oh why can I never work it out?
B	that would have been an error
A	it would have been a classic error though
B	yeah
A	so
B	so so
A	talk to me
B	hello
A	ah it ended really crap
B	well I'm sure it'll be fine
A	no and it's really different to all the other ones like it's way more fictiony than the other ones but oh well
B	sure it'll be fine don't worry
A	you can't just always say that I'll be fine cos sometimes I'm not gonna be fine
B	did this dinner party actually happen?
A	no
B	surely it's fiction then isn't it?
A	yeah but I needed a way for her to be talking about it because I read some of the ones where they literally just started listing objects and I thought it was really boring so yolo
B	okay fair enough
A	don't even care anymore I just wanna quit
A	I want to I hate creative writing I hate it with a passion
B	not quitting
A	uh
B	do not quit
B	yes you couldn't quit
A	sleepy?
B	can't believe you yeah I can't believe you like wasted all your evening
A	what? I didn't waste it I was brushing up on my trivia
B	yeah when you knew you needed to finish your story
A	because I thought that more people were not go basically I checked earlier on and only three people had handed it in and I was like oh cool like half the class are gonna leave it as well so I may as well just leave it cos I need an extra day to finish it and then I went on at ten o'clock just before Never Mind the Buzzcocks and everyone had done it and I was like oh now I'm gonna have to do it now but then I obviously wanted to watch Never Mind the Buzzcocks so I've just done it after
B	ah
A	that was your fault though you told me to finish it I was just gonna not hand it in but then you were like you must finish it before ringing me so that's why
B	yeah but surely that's a good thing
A	yeah but then you can't blame me for pushing your phone call back to eleven because it would have been at half ten had you not made me be good
B	well you would have been at at half ten if you had of done it instead of watching Pointless but
A	yeah but like how can you tell me not to watch Pointless you love Pointless
B	yeah
A	well it is done so
B	okay
B	don't don't do that
A	why not?
B	cos I said so
A	well I don't take no orders from you
B	ha I'm the boss
A	boss bitch
B	yep
A	my bitch
B	interesting
B	erm what was I going to say?
A	I don't know
B	erm
A	do you know what I'm gonna say?
B	no what?
A	unless did you remember your thing?
B	did I remember my thing?
A	well it sounded like you were talking when I was talking then so I thought maybe you'd remembered
B	oh no no I hadn't
A	oh well do you know what I'm really pissed off about? do you remember me telling you that my phone synced to Facebook so I had all my Facebook contacts in here
B	yeah
A	and it took me ages to work out how to get rid of it and like I
B	ah
A	for some reason some of my really important numbers have like disappeared like when I go through my big phonebook list and I scroll down there's no like home saved and my mum's mobile and my nan's nobile nobile? mobile aren't saved in it but then if I go to the phone like the number pad and type it in then it comes up being like do you want to call home? so it's clearly still saved in there it's just disappeared from the list and I'm too retarded to work out how to get it back
B	shit son
A	I know so now at the minute I literally just have to like type half the number and then wait for it to auto guess which one it is that's pissing me off
B	ah
A	yes
B	ah
A	mm mm mm mm
B	well I'm not sure how you fix that to be honest
A	perhaps I should show you my phone when you next come up
B	yeah we'll have a look at it next week
A	yay
B	you've got two days off now
B	ah
A	well I've got to do stuff on them though
B	ah what have you got to do?
A	well
B	oh
A	and then just all that
A	hm?
B	what are you having delivered?
A	oh a phone charger
B	oh I
A	so I can give the other one back
B	yeah well fair enough
A	but yeah erm I was gonna say something but I've forgotten now
B	oh that's rubbish
A	well it's your fault you started asking me a question when I was about to finish and then I forgot so now I don't know I forgot because of
B	I should have let you finish
A	yeah you should have let me finish
B	just rude
B	you were explaining what you were doing
A	I know I was gonna oh yeah no I was just gonna say like I need to do general like sorting out my future stuff as well
B	ah fair enough
A	erm what else are they gonna say? my mum said that we should wait till next year for The Lion King because she gets this like thing in January which you can get discounts off of erm theatre tickets and she said that's how she got cos you know it was my mum that took me last time
B	yeah
A	she said that's how she did it cos otherwise it's like very expensive so she said if we wait until the new year she'll try and get them for us and then we can use her discount yay discount
B	okay do you want me to let you into a
A	uh what?
B	I was using that as a cunning ploy to see what theatre shows you'd actually been to in case I got you that for Christmas
A	oh really? you're too you're too sneaky I can't cope with it
B	it was good though wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	rather than just asking you
A	yeah
B	see I'm smarter than the average bear
A	I can't do bear
B	yeah
A	ah
B	see how smart I am?
A	I know
B	just too good
B	anyway
A	mm
B	ah
A	I know what time at?
B	half eight
A	oh yeah
B	same as always
A	just trying to work out the time you need to go to bed at
B	ah don't worry about that
A	no I will worry because otherwise then you just tell me you're tired all the time and it's not fair because I've got the day off tomorrow so I don't care how long I stay up but if I keep you up for hours then it's naughty because you have to go in tomorrow
B	well I shall stay up until the same time as I stayed up yesterday
A	no I'll end it before then cos you're you're tired today
B	well I was tired yesterday I'm actually not that tired at the minute I just keep yawning
A	oh have you been napping?
B	I had a nap earlier
A	yeah classic
B	yeah I told you I was having a nap
A	I know but like I was busy writing at that time so I wasn't paying much attention to like normally if I'm not doing anything I really notice when you're napping cos I notice that you're not replying but then if I'm busy I don't really notice that you've not replied
B	yeah and
A	it wasn't nine hours it was two cos it was an episode of Pointless which is an hour and an episode of The Chase which is an hour
B	okay
A	and I told you that was
B	I like the way you're blaming him cos you assume that I won't get angry at him
A	but it actually was his fault because all I was doing was innocently getting dinner and then as I walked up to take my food upstairs it was already on and he was watching it and I was like oh I've been sucked in and so it was his fault because if he hadn't of been there with it on I wouldn't have been sucked in
B	okay
A	yep
B	I'll let you off you going out tomorrow night?
A	probably I don't know because basically I finish my antibiotics tomorrow like lunchtime and so I think it's alright to go out because there would have been like a whole like half day but then
B	yeah
A	I didn't know whether to try and ask them if they just wanted to do Wednesday instead but they all like Hustle more than going out on a Wednesday so I don't think that'll work so I don't know what I'm doing yet
B	ah fair enough
B	why?
A	he's he's messaging me today been like oh my god I'm so old I don't know where my life is going and I'm gonna die
B	so old how old is he?
B	I'm not much older
B	oi I'm not that old
A	no you're not
B	mean
A	I'm not
B	you are
A	I'm not I'm just jokes
B	I'm gonna cry now
A	oh fine
B	I'm kidding
B	I think I've actually like pulled a muscle in my groin
A	oh ha ha
B	no but yeah it's like pains not painful it's just a bit sore feels like it needs to be stretched
A	right don't whatever you do don't go tomorrow
B	no I'm not gonna go tomorrow
A	good
B	I go like once every two months
A	what to the gym?
B	my sort of average yeah
A	is that why you have so many problems cos you don't go regularly?
B	probably
A	probs
B	I might go on like Wednesday
A	yeah
B	or Thursday
A	Thursday go Thursday
B	okay yeah I've got an easy  week next week can't wait
A	a what an Indian week?
B	yeah Indian week
A	oh what did you say?
B	easy week
A	easy oh yeah because this is your week where you have one day in and then one day off and then one day off or something
B	like I had one day in the office and that's it
A	yeah oh yeah cos you do it one day
B	well done
A	I do listen
B	stalker
A	no just listener
B	guess what?
A	what?
B	I've got a plan
A	yeah
B	I might buy a new TV
A	oh my god literally why?
B	because in Argos you can get a fifty inch flat screen TV for three hundred pounds so what I can do is I can buy that app which is like
A	you're insane though you don't need another TV I already thought your old TV was big you don't need another TV
B	think how good a fifty inch TV
A	your TV's already good
B	it'll be like the cinema
A	yeah but your TV's already good and if you did that you'd lose all your desk space
B	I I'd lose all my what?
A	your space around where the TV is now you wouldn't have any space because it'd be bigger
B	yeah I can put it on the wall so then I
A	well you're obviously gonna like make your own decisions anyway
B	you've gone really muffled but can't get an actual
A	oh a bell I just said you're obviously gonna meet what?
B	I can hear you now
A	oh
B	yeah sounded like you were talking into a pillow
A	well I wasn't
B	okay
A	you know Hodor remember I told you about Hodor erm from Game of Thrones?
B	yeah
A	you know he did that DJ set in
B	yeah
A	now he's coming to
B	is he?
A	yeah I'll have to see if I can get you a ticket
B	I don't still don't know who he is
A	you're gonna have to fucking learn by next week
B	by next week? what he's coming up next week?
A	he's DJing he's DJing at Halloween that's why I have to try and get you a ticket cos like lol we can't miss Hodor we're gonna have to go out now
B	ah okay
A	don't sound so depressed about it it's Hodor he's majestic
B	I don't even know who he is
A	I'm gonna make you watch Game of Thrones you absolutely have got to watch Game of Thrones
B	ah really?
A	you'll love it I er yes really yes
B	okay
A	ah fine but you should want to watch Game of Thrones cos it is literally amazing right why are you not wanting to watch it? I don't even understand I can't comprehend
B	I'm not I'm not following the trend
A	ah but ah stressing me out fine what would I have to do?
B	I don't know yet I'll
A	well I think it's only fair that you pick something I don't wanna do but actually it will benefit my life massively and make me say oh I'm so glad you did that cos that's what's gonna happen when you watch Game of Thrones you're gonna say oh thank you for making me watch that this is amazing
B	how long is Game of Thrones?
A	well it's a TV show it's an hour long what do you think?
B	well I didn't know did I? it could be half an hour
A	no it's an
B	okay
A	and then erm obviously like you've gotta you've gotta start from the very beginning so you've gotta start right back from season one you can't be jumping because you need to follow the story oh it's so good though so good
B	so I've gotta do that for an hour
A	trust right trust me you need to sit and watch the first erm I don't know couple of episodes of season one and then if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you're not enjoying it I'll let you stop but I know that's not gonna happen cos everyone in their right mind loves Game of Thrones
B	okay if I do that then you have to come on my football stadium tour with me
A	fine deal I will do that if you watch Game of Thrones cos I'm telling you you are gonna love it
B	okay fair enough
A	yep
B	we erm we can do that on our day in
A	oh
A	can we do that after cocktails so that I can get drunk and then not have to pay attention?
B	no
A	oh
B	it's fine you don't have to I'll find someone else
A	well surely you'd enjoy it more with someone else cos you can you can nudge them be like oh look that's so cool that's where so and so did that and they'll actually be like yeah whereas I'd be like uh when's the food?
B	there is no food
B	okay chill out
A	I am chill I'm just mm this is how I plan I just shout things and hope that someone else has written then down
B	this is why I'm the planner
A	you say that but normally I'm the planner so don't be judging like I can't plan you've seen my whiteboard in my room I'm probably the only person who brings a whiteboard to uni so take that
B	okay I have a whiteboard in my kitchen
A	is it your personal whiteboard?
B	no it's not
A	does it does it come with a pink leopard print pen?
B	I don't know
A	does it? does it? does it?
B	probably
A	I don't think it does I think I think I've got the better whiteboard
B	mine's bigger
A	it's not er size doesn't matter
B	it it does massively
A	no it just matters how you use it and I use my whiteboard quite sufficiently thanks
A	no you just mine teaches the art of good handwriting cos the smaller you write the more you fit on
B	yeah but if you write smaller on your and and
A	ah da da da da da da da
B	and you write smaller on mine you still fit more on mine
A	mine's pink end of
B	well I don't know what colour mine is white I think
A	well that's just
A	well that's why mine's infinitely better
B	okay
A	my bed's moved way too far away from the wall
B	ah
A	I reckon I could fit my face down there now
B	try it
A	my whole face try it what if I get stuck like when I got stuck in the cupboard in the other room
B	I was I was thinking more if you do that then all you
A	well
A	that's not very nice and I'm not going to do it
A	yeah which you were giggling over
B	ah I'd come and kiss you better
A	I'd hope so after pushing me down there
B	woah woah woah I never said I pushed you
A	well you would have pushed me by by proxy because it was your idea
B	you'd have probably just fallen down there cos you moved so far to the other side of the bed when we cuddle
B	you'd you'd you'd have moved
A	how do you know?
B	cos you'd have needed dinner at some point
A	and a wee
B	yeah you should only possibly be in there for an hour at most
B	yeah
A	they're doing free samples at the minute you can go online and apply for some free samples I was like I should totally do that
B	yeah you should
A	I should
B	ah we've we've got this erm my boss has got this new thing for his
B	it'll be dogs barking that we've recorded this woman screaming and we've put it in
A	you guys
A	you should film like a hidden camera show at your work
B	it's great
A	a ghost?
B	yeah
A	what?
B	cos I keep I've been to the toilet three times in like the last month and
A	I thought that was the end of the story
B	no
B	and the keys for the room next door are normally just left in the door
A	right
B	and I can always hear them jangling
A	are these on windy days or no there's no these are like proper jangling as if you were holding a bunch of keys jangling?
B	and it's not another person just holding them?
A	no
B	no no one says that they've been up and they all swear that they have not been up there
A	could just be more classic work bants
B	no one of the girls is proper scared of ghosts and she's like no seriously no one could have been up there I swear on my life
A	oh okay
B	I'm like I'm like oh okay we'll I've had it like three times now
A	maybe this is why you don't wee enough? cos you're just too scared to subconsciously
B	well yeah
A	I'll send you like to Derek Acorah and he'll sort you out
B	yeah we'll get him in cos it used to be an old dairy our building
A	oh cheese
B	er
B	erm I don't know
A	oh okay useless
B	er yeah well
A	what over your test?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	like make sure you read these three areas cos that's what the question's gonna be about
A	did you say anything about it?
B	no well whatever at least I've read it
A	yeah
B	well I needed to read it anyway before
A	yeah maybe maybe that was his plan all along
B	mm I dunno
A	ah
B	erm does does anyone at your in your house drink whisky?
A	erm maybe why?
B	do they want a bottle of whisky?
A	are you on about like you found some whisky and no one wants it or you're or you're on about buying it cos
B	no I won it at in a raffle like a fortified bottle of whisky and I'm never gonna drink it
A	erm yeah what kind?
B	Bell's it's like a erm a black labelled one so it's like a special type or something
A	ah how'd you win it?
B	it was part of a raffle
A	yeah but where? what?
B	at the golf club there was a raffle and then they picked my number out and like won the prize
A	right cheers for that
A	yeah but I I don't think I mean how I think I meant maybe like where or something like where was the raffle
B	ah it was at the golf club
A	okay thanks
B	well
A	well I've asked them
B	right okay cos er yeah they can just have it I don't know anyone that drinks whisky
A	I'm surprised you don't you're an old man
B	oi I'm not
B	not old
A	what thing?
B	your P whatever it is
A	my PGCE?
B	P yeah
B	okay tell him he can have it
A	erm yeah PGCE erm
B	yeah
A	erm use that time to get the experience that you need cos you did I tell you? have I told you already? I can't remember if it was you I was talking to erm that I have to get so many weeks work experience in a school before I can apply
B	yeah
A	yeah so I'm gonna use that year out to erm
B	okay
A	erm what was I saying?
B	talking about having a year out
A	oh yeah so I'll take a year out use that time to get the experience in the schools that I need and then obviously like work as well erm
B	yeah
A	I'm hoping to be able to get a job like as either a classroom assistant or a nursery assistant sort of thing cos even though that's not great money like they're the kind of roles that gives me experience whilst paying me and you don't have to like cos you obviously you can't go be like a teaching assistant until you've done a training course but you can be a nursery assistant cos they're not teachers
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? so I might try and get a job like that and then I was thinking maybe try and like carry on with my tutoring erm
B	yeah
A	just so that I've got loads of experience working with kids and then at some point I wanna I dunno cos obviously this all depends on how much money I've earnt but I wanna go somewhere like I know I haven't got the job but I still wanna travel even if it's not to America I wanna go somewhere before I start working for good do you know what I mean?
B	oh right
A	right yeah mm probably not for that long now but
B	yeah
A	cos I know a
B	yeah
A	I just wanna do
B	yeah
A	and then yeah obviously I'll apply to start a PGCE in the following September and then er that takes just under a year cos you finish in July erm
B	yeah
A	I've been looking I've been looking at I looked I can't remember if I told no I don't think it was you I was telling you this I looked at
B	right
A	so I've been looking at
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean the
B	yeah
A	erm like the one at
A	I get to do the early years bit as well which is you know like the
B	yeah
A	erm so I liked that cos I kinda the like the younger they are the more I prefer it like when I've done my work experience before I've done it in erm I've done work experience in reception year one year two and year five and I definitely preferred working with the little ones erm I'd rather work in a nursery than a school but
B	yeah
A	even though er teaching isn't exactly like gonna pay me that much anyway nursery work is literally like bottom of the barrel stuff so yeah
B	it doesn't pay that badly
A	it's not bad but it's just not great do you know what I mean?
B	mm it's still probably like twenty-five grand a year
A	yeah but that's not that much like considering how expensive everything is now it's not er
B	yeah
A	it's good but it's not enough to like live on comfortably and do everything I'd wanna do not that teaching really will be either but I don't really have any other options so
B	mm fair enough what are you planning to do then?
A	what do you mean?
B	you said to live comfortably and plan and do what I wanna do
A	well just like you know like thinking long-term I wanna have children but I don't really wanna be one of those people who does it when they can't afford to look after them
B	yeah
A	and I wanna be like my mum's always been really good at taking us on holidays and there's only been like one year I think where she couldn't afford to do it and she makes sure she takes us every year I'd wanna be able to do that because then like I've been so many places I think it's important to keep that up
B	well fair enough
B	well hopefully you won't
A	no I know it better not be
B	yeah
A	but I don't wanna I'm never gonna be that sort of person and goes oh it doesn't matter how much I'm earning because you're earning so-and-so amount cos that's not fair like got to be able to contribute and think about worse case scenarios if it does end up being me on my own
B	and my
B	that's fine then
A	I'm not a sponger
B	that's fine we'll split bills down the middle and I'll just keep
A	you can't I'm just gonna throw this out there if you become a millionaire and I'm still just a teacher we ain't splitting fifty fifty
B	what? that's
A	I'm a frigging teacher you're a millionaire
B	you said that you wanted to er you wanted to
A	contribute contribute and I would contribute equally if we were on equal salaries but if we are talking you have literally made millions and I'm making like twenty grand a year that that's just unacceptable
B	although
A	yeah
B	yeah no it will just go into savings
B	I'll just spend it it's fine
A	no
B	cos next month I'll get another fifty grand
A	oh god
B	right you're gonna regret saying split it
A	I didn't say split equally I just wanted you to know I'm not gonna like expect to live off your money however if you were to become a millionaire I would expect to not have to pay half and half
B	okay deal
A	okay
B	well see I think you're you're gonna end up better off in this deal
A	no
B	I'm I'm
A	well that's not my fault
A	what's weird? that I'm so shit compared to you?
B	no you're not
B	I just know it's gonna happen
B	like
A	oh for god's sake
B	he said exactly the same I'm not I'm just
A	yeah
B	it's just when it happens
B	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	are you seeing
A	no it was erm this morning on the way to my lecture erm I think cos like
A	well I couldn't this time cos it was cos it was non-fiction
B	you definitely have to get
A	okay I will
B	yeah
B	and was
B	thought about sounding like
A	what about it? it's just it's not quite as catchy it hasn't really stayed with me
B	no need to try and get that into like one of your stories as well but maybe
A	I'll tell you why because no one would lend him bloody trousers
B	well
A	that sand in that crack is your fault you could have prevented it with a simple pair of orange trousers
B	I could but do you know what? they're my orange trousers so
B	now he is but he's mainly a mode of transport
B	would like to ride my phoenix down to Tesco
A	I really really wanted brownies earlier
A	well it wasn't it wasn't if you followed my brain through its thought process my thought process went oh yeah he went to Tesco to get the cheesecake and then I was like oh desserts I love desserts you know I love desserts and then I was like oh yeah I was craving brownies earlier and that's what I decided to tell you
B	oh okay
A	oh really
B	I can I can even remember the
B	you actually remembered what the full story don't you?
A	how can you not remember what you were taking him there for?
B	oh it was orange cheesecake wasn't it?
A	you cos you ruined it no one wants orange cheesecake it's all about the vanilla
B	no no no
A	it's all about the banana
B	no it's not
B	you if you ever blaspheme like that again
B	oh thanks you're such a hero
A	I know lol I'll be there like eating the chocolate cake like yeah this this could still have banana hidden in it somewhere
A	and went in your mains I'll be like let me check this isn't banana curry
B	well we can go at Christmas time
A	eh yes I love
A	I know I'm sorry it's my
B	yeah well do you know where we can go at we can go at Christmas
A	yeah? well it depends doesn't it cos we could I don't know we'll talk about it when you're up because if you've got like four days off in a row we may as well go somewhere other than
B	yeah
A	but we can sort that out when you're up cos it's easier to do it face-to-face cos then we could use my laptop and shit
B	yeah we can have a laptop become a footballer
A	no no footballing I told you get out get it out your system before you come up cos you've only got four days here I do not wanna be seen
B	I've been trying but it doesn't work on my laptop
A	oh no
B	mm such a let down
B	it's really frustrating
A	right I'll make you a deal
B	what?
A	you can become a footballer
B	right
A	that's not the end of the deal
B	yeah yeah I
A	no I was trying to work out I was gonna say you can become a footballer in that hour that I can go on campus on Thursday then I was thinking if you're here I might not go anyway because I've been going and it's bloody pointless because he's one of those ones that literally reads off the slides and I could just print the slides off at home so I don't know whether I'm gonna go or not if I go then you can become a footballer then
B	okay yeah
A	yeah then you can become a footballer in the times I'm in the shower
B	yeah
A	and
B	just on that you need to start taking longer showers
B	because you yeah you're starting to smell so I really think you should start taking longer showers
A	you can also become a footballer when I'm doing my makeup that gives you half an hour of being a footballer
B	yeah
A	see look how nice I am to you
B	I know you're a hero
B	this is why I love you
A	yes
B	what?
A	I said yes

A	yeah
B	I still have a picture of you erm it's just a picture of you
A	oh god well what one?
B	in a black and white top and a red skirt
A	eh?
B	what?
A	I don't I'm trying to remember what it is and I don't is it one of my profile pictures?
B	yeah I think so
A	well that's alright then it won't be an ugly one
B	that doesn't look ugly
A	oh yeah some of the ones I left on there when I drunk took you phone a took a load of selfies on it and then forgot until the morning when you were going through them some of those are hideous
B	mm I deleted some of the blurred ones of me as well

A	oh thanks
B	that's alright
A	ye am I right in thinking that's the twenty-second yeah?
B	yeah
A	sweet I didn't wanna show up like on the wrong weekend like hi
A	erm do you wanna come up on the fourteenth? or like obviously a bit before then but cos erm you know you've got a choice of two weekends
B	yeah
A	I thought if you came up on that one erm the
B	yeah that's good
A	yay
B	yeah that's good
A	yay
B	are we driving?
A	huh?
B	are we driving?
A	how else are we gonna get there? why?
B	are we gonna go through
B	yeah maybe leave earlier
A	yeah we well when you come up we don't have to go out erm that much then cos yeah yeah
B	cos yeah yeah
A	I was just thinking in my head like I was trying I was getting confused I was gonna say we don't have to go out that much that weekend when you're up and then I got confused and thought I was talking about Halloween all of a sudden I was like oh no we'll definitely be going out I remembered I was actually talking about the fourteenth of November which is a completely different time and I was like oh yeah we don't have to go out cos that's why we didn't make out till ages last time cos we were both like sleeping off last the night before
B	yeah but that time I'll have only travelled up on the Friday night
A	yeah
B	and then yeah so I guess we might be going out the Friday night
A	no and then we can just go to the thing on the Saturday and then potentially go out Saturday night if you wanted to
B	yeah and then
A	yeah
B	yes?
A	yah
B	then the week after you're coming down to me
A	yep my mum was like laughing being like I bet your car won't make it and I was like thanks for that it bloody needs to
B	you'll make it
A	it needs to I don't have another choice
B	yeah
A	but obviously if I leave it too long it'll stop working
B	maybe you should like drive it round the block
A	yeah well it's out it's nearly out of petrol like it's on like one-and-a-half bars so I was thinking I could just take it to the petrol station and back again cos that's something to do but it's just the fact that essentially when I move I know I'm going to lose my spot so I keep putting it off and being like I'll go another day
B	yeah maybe do it like tomorrow during the daytime or something when no one's gonna nick it
A	yeah maybe if how maybe not tomorrow cos I wasn't really planning on putting clothes on maybe
A	huh?
B	anytime I'm just saying you could do it during the day
A	well I might do it Thursday because I'll actually have clothes on Thursday cos I have to go out campus for an hour
B	yeah do you know do you wanna know a crazy fact?
