B	is that to fit them bits in?
C	the hinges
B	the hinges in yeah
C	cos all the doors haven't got
A	yeah
C	holes in
B	no
C	for the hinges so
C	and I thought it can't be thirty-two
B	was it?
C	it's actually
A	right
C	thirty-five so there was twenty twenty doors in total
B	crikey
C	to do and I says you really could do with a bench drill
B	yeah
C	because we've got to pull it down and you've got to get the depth
B	you have yeah
C	you know and if you come through that face and everything I said so this was on Saturday and he went oh I'll ask I'll ask
B	yeah
C	so we we put that in the utility room put the cutter in made a jig
B	yeah?
C	to see whether the er
B	yeah
C	fitted perfectly
B	does it?

C	so I burnt the cutter out
B	what sort of wood is it you're
A	oh
C	it's oak
B	oak? well it'll be really
A	oh
B	hard stuff then that would
C	yeah but
B	because oak is oak gets harder as it get older don't it
C	you know it's not it I wouldn't say it's that you know it's relatively new oak
B	is it? yeah
C	but and as you're cutting on the
B	of course yeah
C	so it shouldn't really burn it
B	no
C	cos it's I mean it's going in
A	mm
C	so I mean it
A	oh
C	so I said oh I said well I'll see if I can find another cutter
B	yeah
C	I'll get another cutter and I'll pop back tomorrow so when I went into
B	what?
A	oh
B	did you buy it?
C	I bought it yeah cos it's it was a good one I bought the Screwfix I bought the the five in a set from Screwfix?
B	yeah yeah
C	which was something like
B	yeah
C	you can see why
B	yeah
C	so we've got er we've still got twelve doors to do
B	you're done
C	I put
B	wow that was a good
A	mm
B	cutter then
A	yeah
C	so we'd put the we'd put the doors on we'd put the holes in
B	yeah
C	put the hinges on even put the knobs on as well
B	yeah?
A	oh right

B	did you
C	in the
B	tell in about how much the cutter was?

B	oh I see yeah yeah
A	mm yeah
C	it's that little bit of you know when I said I don't when I see you
B	yeah?
C	and I thought yeah okay
A	ah
C	so
A	so is this a big kitchen? cos there's loads of doors
C	it was a it was a fair sized kitchen
A	yeah
C	yeah sort of the hardest one were the drawers
B	yeah?
C	there was no template for the drawers
B	weren't there? oh dear
C	and you have to put two
B	yeah
C	that with two holes and you have to fit it and it fit puts it in and drops down
B	that's it yeah
C	no
B	yeah
A	oh
C	no template at all
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah I did that and two of the doors that came had got glass in well no they hadn't got the glass in cos there's no glass in them they've come without glass
B	have they? oh christ
A	yeah
C	so
A	mm
B	did they? yeah
A	sound nice doesn't it?
C	so it's it's it's nice it's nice
C	it's it's looking alright
A	mm
C	from a from a er I suppose a carpenter builder type thing
B	yeah
C	to
B	yeah
C	so you know so two sort of two sides
B	was it? oh crikey

A	yeah
B	yeah

B	yeah?
A	mm
C	the
B	oh okay
C	and er
B	oh right
C	well if you're not self-employed that's quite difficult to do innit?
B	yeah it is innit yeah
C	cos if you do put an invoice in for doing it and it goes in their books then somewhere along the lines the tax person's gonna wanna
B	yeah he he'll
C	cross reference it somewhere isn't he?
B	yeah yeah
C	so I mean dunno what I'm gonna do there so
A	mm

B	oh did you? yeah yeah
C	dunno why all the rest fitted
B	yeah
C	but this one bracket was just like
B	yeah
C	so we just
A	oh
C	elongated the hole so it dropped down a little bit further
B	yeah
C	and then it all matched it all matched in
B	oh
C	so that was alright
A	ah
C	that was alright
A	mm
B	yeah
A	B and Q are

C	yeah
A	yeah
C	it'll just it it'll just disintegrate and you can see it
A	yeah
C	that's the first that's the first one that I would do
B	yeah
C	and then I'd
A	it's such a big job isn't it though to have carpets laid?
C	no
A	you've gotta clear out the whole room
C	yeah it's not a big job
B	well it is here
C	depends on it depends on what you've got in your room doesn't it?
B	we've got too much in our bedroom
C	cos
A	yeah
B	great old wardrobe which we have to take to pieces to get through the door
C	mm
B	mm?
C	I don't have that problem cos they're
B	no
C	fitted
A	they're all fitted
B	you got fitted wardrobes yeah

A	mm
B	and er
A	the big wardrobe
B	the wardrobe and the bed
A	mm
B	and to get them out
C	yeah
A	mm
C	well you could always I mean you can just empty the wardrobe and it's always a good one to leave if you're putting the carpet down is to manoeuvre it
B	could do
C	if you're using if you're not using stretchers or whatever
B	well I'm not I'm not laying it
A	we're not gonna fit them no so they want they want a clear room don't they?
B	they'll want a clear room
C	yeah cos it's only like a half hour job to in a clear room
B	yeah
A	we we've done
C	yeah
A	carpets before and not made a good job of it
B	no
C	oh right
B	then then you've gotta knee bash it
A	yeah
B	stretch
C	yeah yeah yeah bolster chisel
C	no but that's what they use
B	what this these these things have got these little needles in and things
C	yeah
B	and then they
A	mm
B	and they grip the carpet and they push it in
A	mm
B	over the top of the then the the the spline that goes all around the side with the with the nails in it
C	easy
B	that not easy
C	well it used to be easy let's put it that way
A	yeah
B	well I ain't gonna do it
C	I don't know whether I could do it now but it used to be easy
A	mm
C	used to be easy
A	so are we thinking about carpets or are we
B	I think we'll just let it
B	no
A	as far as we know
B	well it's right in the doorways

A	well yeah
C	it's thin isn't it?
B	yeah
A	wouldn't be good would it?
B	and very brittle and I think
A	mm
B	that's how most of these greenhouses get smashed up
A	possibly yeah
B	yeah
C	well it deteriorates doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	greenhouse back at
A	yeah
B	you know the wind
C	mm
B	must have
A	mm
B	what happened that must have been so bad that it made the pressure inside the greenhouse less than the pressure outside and that just went
B	and just finished up as a heap of
A	all very neat
B	yeah didn't didn't splatter all over the place
B	yeah
A	mm
C	there's a tree
B	no
A	no

B	is he opening it? there's something on on
B	yeah
A	yeah is there?
B	yeah
A	were we? okay
B	according to according to them
A	mm
B	but I don't
A	he did sell a couple of your pictures
B	yeah
A	yeah took about three months to get the money
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that was a a group of pictures weren't it?
A	yeah that's a trio just only small ones
C	mm
A	the was
A	globey type things with the butterfly on them
B	yeah
C	with birds on
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos you got that
B	yeah that's right he's got one down there now
C	I dunno whether he's moved it
A	oh yes whether
C	where they were
B	that's him yeah
A	no that's someone else
B	is it somewhere is it? oh
A	down in the near the cinema
C	yeah it's
A	yes
C	that is
B	mm
A	he's got some lovely stuff in there
C	yeah a lot of it's photoshopped
A	mm
B	yeah
C	cos he did an open studio in his house
B	did he? oh
C	yeah and I went to it and had a look
A	oh right
C	and the same picture
A	oh
C	the same picture but it had on one occasion it had a barn owl in
B	oh right
C	and on another occasion it had two little owls
B	oh right
C	well if I remember rightly two little owls and a barn owl or a tawny owl don't all use the same area
B	they don't do they no
A	yeah
C	so yeah
B	oh yeah?
C	of the viaduct
B	did you?
A	mm
C	and then Saturday I've put that one up again because somebody had been on the railway that day somebody that follows me he lives on a canal barge her and her
B	oh right
C	and had taken a picture so I so I sent the picture to them type of thing and then that got
B	did it? oh right
C	and then I put one looking across the Dales
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's a pity you don't get paid for these retweets
C	it is indeed
B	but it's all voluntary innit? that's like
A	mm
B	that annoy me when when the BBC or ITV say oh you must send us your pictures of this or that and the other well with these modern phones and what have you people are on on the site of anything that's happening innit and they get it for free where they don't have to send a a reporter with all with all the gear and and stuff out
C	ah yeah
B	they get these pictures for free
A	yeah
A	mm
B	and I think oh that's not right you know they should they should pay for them like they have to pay otherwise these erm photographers that have been years with BBC or ITV or whatever they they they get the bullet don't they? they get made redundant
C	yeah oh you you mean the video stuff?
B	yeah
C	and they use that video stuff I mean I I was quite impressed with the BBC when they emailed me about my pictures of
A	oh yes
C	Liverpool
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you didn't get to see it did you?
C	I I they sent me the links to it
B	did they?
C	it wasn't it wasn't on the T it wasn't on the TV it was
B	oh right
C	on their
A	oh
C	website
A	cos we recorded it
B	oh right
A	didn't we?
B	yeah we recorded it
C	yeah
A	it was in
C	yeah I thought it was on their TV but it was on
B	yeah
C	it was on their website
A	oh
B	oh
C	on their local news website
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's
A	mm
C	but that generated a that generated a bit of interest so
A	mm
C	so

A	right
B	yeah

B	busy? we didn't see anyone did we?
C	well it was
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	maybe
B	but
C	no I think it was probably the cheapest place to go
B	it's a long drive
C	didn't take that long
B	well it's over four hours
A	yeah
C	er ten o'clock one o'clock you know?
B	how fast do you go?
A	probably not a place we'd choose to for again we did not like Bournemouth at all
C	Bournemouth is a strange place I ain't been to
B	yeah that's all you wanna do
C	but it's really
A	yeah we weren't very impressed with that
C	it's very from what I know it's very stag nights and hen nights and old people I think
B	yeah there's a lot of old people there
A	yeah
B	but er but the actual
A	no I know but but it was kind
B	but the actual place was er like a
A	well
B	er
A	kind of
B	like a Great Yarmouth
A	grubby almost?
B	mm?
A	bit grubby perhaps?
B	yeah like a Great Yarmouth
C	it doesn't have
A	yeah
C	a
A	yeah
C	it has something that pulls you towards it
A	yes
B	yeah

C	alright?
A	yeah
C	so if you think

B	yeah
C	I I can't remember
B	yeah
C	how did
A	yeah
B	you find Beverley?
A	well we liked that because of the place
B	that was lovely
A	but then
B	yeah
A	yes Beverley was alright
C	you see? now Beverley is
A	it's completely different to our usual
C	so totally different
A	but
C	you see but Beverley is has something about it now I
A	and and even the shops were quite pleasant to be with
B	they were lovely places
C	yeah

C	you see
A	and a lovely church
C	and when you've been to Cornwall

A	actually
C	but I like King Alfred and I like all that thing but I do not like Glastonbury
B	no
A	mm
C	and I you know it may be because of a it may be because of a an experience I had there wasn't happy there
B	no
A	yeah
B	you know we'd go again but there are places where we've been and we'd never go again
C	yeah wouldn't go to the New Forest again
A	no
B	no
A	well
B	no
A	we wouldn't I don't particularly
B	well we wouldn't we wouldn't to be honest with you
A	mm
B	we didn't find it as obnoxious as you but er
A	well it was just er
B	there's nothing
A	quite ordinary apart from the horses which are lovely
C	I was
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	cos I was expecting something a little bit more
B	well
A	mm
B	to be honest with you I've been there yonks ago and I and I thought then where's the forest?
A	similar really
B	where's the forest?
C	it's like going it's like going to
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	it was just the horses that made it special
B	the horses
C	the horses it's the you know it's the
A	it's not otherwise it
C	it's the New Forest ponies
A	it could have been anywhere
C	yeah

A	and the shops so
C	so
A	they were interesting lovely shops
C	see but
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well that's the whole point that that it's a bit too much of a of a tourist pull there with er with all the with all the shops and stuff
A	were not touristy people really
C	see it's yeah it's like erm
B	we didn't like Dorset

A	mm

A	mm
B	you're supposed to find the fossils and
B	Chesil beach
A	Chesil yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	fishing line galore
C	mm
A	but they must have cleaned it up now
B	well
A	they must but yeah
B	yeah but we were on the
A	but it was bad though
B	car park
A	but it was bad though
B	that cost us four quid to
A	mm
B	it all over the car park floor we we paid four quid for the car park we went down to the beach
A	stayed half an hour
B	stayed half an hour and thought
A	thought how
B	how disgusting it was come back
A	well you couldn't sit on the beach so
C	yeah
B	and we said to the car park
A	you know
B	bloke we'll have we'll have to report this to the council this is

A	so we were going to
B	we were so
A	write
B	angry we were
A	when we got back
C	yeah
A	but we didn't
B	and you know for all all the bumf and the hype that's that they've done for Chesil beach you would have thought that was a really good area to be
A	mm
B	but it was difficult I'll bet kids or anyone couldn't walk across there with bare feet
C	no
A	yeah
C	oh I don't
B	well we got we got er your cousin that live in Dorset don't she?
A	yeah she does

B	they're in the central part of it
A	like I think
B	they live in a they live in the place called
A	yeah
B	they have this huge
A	yeah
B	and that's quite nice that was nice there weren't it?
A	yes it was
C	it's like it's like erm where Stonehenge is
B	well years ago when I was seventeen I went to
C	yeah
B	with nobody going oh get out of the way and all that now it's all fenced off isn't it?
C	yeah
B	you can't get to the stones any more
C	no
B	not without having a guide to take you around and we walked round there me and three other boys we were on we were on holiday camping holiday and we walked round Stonehenge and touched the stones and
A	mm
B	cos the stones don't just stand there they go down as well
C	yeah they go down a
B	yeah
A	amazing isn't it?
C	but they have moved them a couple of times to see what's underneath them
B	yeah they have yeah they're they're doing a dig there now at the moment they're digging
A	oh right
B	this er big they just found a graveyard haven't they just outside Stonehenge
A	yeah
C	they're doing a cos they're doing a new visitor centre there aren't they?
B	mm yeah
C	attraction to it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and they just found this graveyard and they've been digging up er women with babies and
C	ritual
B	ritual site where they've been actually
A	mm
B	slaughtered they're saying one one of them had his head caved in
A	mm
B	so that's very interesting they're still digging
A	that's quite a way from the stones though isn't it?
B	it is a way from
C	mm
B	the stones but it's all part and parcel of the henge you're you've got Stonehenge and you've got other henges all the way round with
A	with burial mounds or
B	with burial mounds and
A	mm mm
B	still little henges I mean
C	yeah
B	we got we got er out out on the
A	cos they started
B	cos they started to rot away
A	deteriorating
B	they've been there for thousands of years
C	keep them wet they needed to get the water over them all the time
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and it's gotta be sea water
C	yeah
B	so anyway they've put it back in now stupid waste of time that was weren't it?
A	mm
C	yeah it's it's
B	all that money
C	keeps people's jobs keeps people in jobs
B	yeah well lots of them
A	yeah
B	are actual er volunteers and they're the ones that are keeping these other people in jobs
A	mm
B	these people with their clipboards are saying oh now go and if you go and dig there you could you dig there and what have you they're getting the money for it and these volunteers are going and doing it all for nothing
C	work
B	you know the work
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	which is where
A	volunteers on the railways aren't there?
B	yeah
A	the on the railways
B	railway volunteers you got all them volunteers
A	mm
B	that do the
C	yeah like the National Trust the English Heritage and
B	yeah
A	mm
B	in fact if you join er English Heritage it's about seventy-five quid a year
C	National Trust
B	National Trust is it? yeah
C	English Heritage is cheaper
B	is it? we used to be in English Heritage didn't we?
A	yeah yeah
C	they wrote to me a couple of they wrote to me last month saying cos like
B	did they? yeah
C	no point
B	there is no point no
C	don't go
A	mm
B	no
A	we don't go to National
B	I mean for for how many times you go to these National Trusts and English Heritage sites
A	we've
B	and
A	never ever made it pay have we?
B	no we never made it pay
C	oh I've made it pay
B	have you?
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	see I see I go to
B	yeah
C	two
A	mm
C	or three times a year
B	yeah
A	oh right
C	you know
A	mm
C	I mean last year I went to
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	yeah but once you've been there you've been there
C	it changes the gardens change
B	yeah I think
C	walking around
B	so yeah
A	yeah
C	you can go and walk you can walk round the
A	mm
C	the estate
A	yeah
C	the garden's changed they have different things on erm
C	yeah
C	there's three
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	in the just in this area
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and they're around about fifteen pound a time to go in something like that
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and there's forty-five pound
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and then if you and then I did Wimpole this year
B	yeah?
C	which was another that was twenty-one pound that one
A	right
C	if you do the whole
A	mm
B	yeah
C	you get free park up yeah
A	mm
C	so
B	well I suppose it's
A	yeah
B	worth it in in if if you're that way inclined
C	English Heritage ones?
A	yeah the
B	National Trust
C	I mean
A	it's not even English Heritage is it it's something else isn't it?
C	no the in Yorkshire
B	it's the National Parks
A	what about Aysgarth? that's
C	Aysgarth?
A	that is
B	that isn't
A	it's one I remember
B	yeah yeah
A	it's not
B	you have to pay for that they don't accept English Heritage
A	no
B	or anything like that
C	there's that there there is the Bolton there's Bolton Abbey Bolton Castle
B	Bolton Abbey Bolton Castle yeah
A	and Bolton Abbey which don't belong to the National Trust or English Heritage so they're separate
B	yeah
A	so you have to pay for them differently
B	you do
A	but you've got
B	we found most of the stuff in
A	yeah
B	have to pay for it didn't you?
C	the stuff in well I
A	mm
C	English
B	yeah
C	but Pickering
B	yeah
C	so I could do those
B	yeah
C	Helmsley Castle is English Heritage
B	oh
C	so I got my money out up there
B	yeah
C	cos you don't pay for children with that one
B	oh I see yeah
C	if you're if you have membership
A	mm
C	you get children membership
B	yeah
C	with it
A	yeah
B	that's a family membership yeah
C	a family membership which is cheaper than
A	that's what we did thinking we could take take anyone then
B	yeah
C	which is
A	take the little ones as well
C	than the National Trust
B	yeah
A	mm
B	like that that seems such a shame that you have National Trust and English Heritage two different
A	yeah
B	charities they could they could amalgamate
C	well if you look at all the English Heritage stuff
A	it's different I know
C	totally different
B	I know it's different yeah but it seems so strange
C	it's like ruins
B	mm?
C	it's like ruins and a lot of the
B	yeah
C	English Heritage ones are free to go in
A	yes they are
B	yeah
A	mm
C	so like at
B	is there?
A	oh
B	yeah it's even down at the
A	yeah we went
B	oh
A	English Heritage ones to
B	we did yeah
A	to use it up or try to use it up
B	yeah
C	see
A	the money
