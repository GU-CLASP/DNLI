A	oh right
B	excellent well I'm well they are tradespeople but I know them both sort of socially as well which makes it a bit easier you know I mean
A	well er if it means that you know certain things
B	yeah
A	ask them or worry about
B	and I don't feel I have to stay in the house all the time
A	yeah
B	you know I can
A	well
B	go and out and not hide wallets
A	that's true
B	and god knows what you know
A	yes that's true too
B	erm
A	did they finish did they do a good job of it?
B	yeah they they finished it this morning yeah it only took them one day and a hour and a half to paint a room probably this size er woodwork doors and ceiling and the walls
A	including preparation and
B	yeah yeah and they've done a cracking
A	moving all the furniture and all that kind of stuff?
B	well I moved the furniture
A	oh okay
B	for them so that helped
A	oh
B	they offered to move all the furniture back in for me but I'm gonna
A	yeah quite
B	more devoid of
B	yeah put that
A	obviously they've put sheets down
B	that er yeah they put all that stuff down
A	I'm just gonna get the cups from the kitchen
B	mm
A	so that's all done
B	yeah in September
A	I've only still found one plumbers builders who
B	yeah?
A	even
B	really?
A	they look very expensive
B	I spoke to a couple of people
A	ah now that sounds
B	and everybody thinks well you're not gonna get that done for less than nine ten thousand pounds
A	does that include your appliances?
B	yeah well it will including your cooker
A	well that's already six hundred quid seven hundred quid
B	sure
A	who knows how much more
B	and I might not go for a convention freestanding gas at the top with the oven underneath so I might spread it to a gas hob er and have a separate oven somewhere else in the kitchen you know if you see what I mean
A	would you also have an island like in those
B	no
A	lifestyle magazines?
B	I don't have enough room
A	an island
B	I'd have to knock through into the
A	that's that's
B	garage
A	a bit rich yes
B	and I couldn't get the car in there
B	you know I do anyway but er no I I think I shall be an island free
B	kitchen
A	it's so
B	yes
A	can I offer you a half of this
B	oh lovely yes
A	it's possibly
B	yes yes
A	rather
B	it's like a blueberry
B	pie or
A	yes it is
B	something like that
A	it is a blueberry pie
B	of course yes it's looking very crumbly
A	and it's not gonna be easy I'm afraid so
B	oh thank you very much
A	so erm
B	that's excellent where did you get this from?
A	well I was down in
B	oh yeah?
A	and er there was a a launch of a one point four million pound
B	mm
A	project which I'm vaguely attached to and there was lots of things
B	yeah
A	mm
B	before I read it I just saw the title
A	yeah
B	and I thought I wonder if he wants the recordings I did of all those police officers years ago
A	now they would
B	or
A	not be in the public domain
B	or whether you were interested in recordings I'd made of films about the police something like that
A	yeah
B	I I had not a clue that you meant
A	it is nice isn't it?
B	mm
A	goes well
B	we
A	with coffee
B	mm it does so was this
A	oh it's difficult to tell it was good
B	yeah?
A	to see them you
B	yeah
A	and I'm I usually admiring of somebody who can get that big a project going for
B	yeah
A	it's just
B	yeah
A	horrendously difficult but there's five strands to this project and it's pretty obvious to everybody that they're all very different they do different things
B	mm
A	be good enough in its own right to produce stuff and that's what the
B	well you see a few years ago I was involved a project like this
A	ah
B	which was supposed to be about good governance and the criminal justice system and it was coordinated by a chap from er London who was also a fellow at
B	I was doing one on on crime figures
A	did
B	you know
A	it it it surely there must be you're teasing me? no it was really that?
B	no I am not teasing you
B	this this you know erm
A	all-encompassing
B	erm brand really and it was
A	yeah
B	impossible
A	right
B	it was it was impossible it wasn't just that some were geographers and some were economists and all that sort of thing it was just it was chalk cheese
A	yeah
B	apples pears
A	apple pears
B	yeah
A	well the the funding body must have gone in with its eyes open I mean they would have
B	mm
A	out with the the general pattern the social science element they'd have said cut this bit or we won't give you the money
B	mm
A	the other thing is you
B	instead
A	you they mutate don't they? once you get the money people do slightly different things
B	yeah
A	you know
B	is there anything likely to be in for a discourse?
A	that's what I'm hoping for the
B	mm
A	one of them the strands was about
B	yeah
A	on intellectual stability
B	well that would be very good wouldn't it?
A	it would
B	and very prestigious
A	mm
B	well I wish you luck with that excellent er
A	well it was good
B	muffin
A	it's worth knowing that
B	excellent yeah it does go very well with the coffee too
B	rather Italian that
A	but you can't dunk it
B	well no I'm not a dunker of er if I did it would be in tea with a
B	biscuit
A	it would have to be a biscuit in tea it couldn't be something like this in tea
B	no I mean my
A	cos it would just fall apart
B	friend my
A	ah yes
B	I have Italian friends who have a
A	yes
B	huge
A	yes yes
B	coffee cup
A	yes
B	looks more like
A	yes
B	soup
A	yes
B	bowl
A	yes yes
B	and there they are with their
A	yeah
B	croissant
A	yeah that makes sense as long as the croissant is not the savoury kind obviously
B	I oh well I I'm not er I'm not a dunker of croissants or
A	yeah yeah
B	far too much effort
B	for me in the morning
A	that's right to go to the other extreme I was in a
B	mm
A	a place in
B	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	so I thought I'll just ask a young lady and er can you
B	completely blank face was it?
A	completely blank look but obviously you know keen to help er I I'm certainly I'm sure we can do that just remind me what it is again? I said well I I but I chose my words not very carefully I said
B	uhu
A	well it's basically an espressowith a drop of milk in it
B	uhu
A	ah now that
B	right
A	is
A	up to a point
B	yeah
A	and what do you think I got?
B	a milky lukewarm coffee?
A	espresso
B	yeah
B	yeah and stirred in?
B	yes exactly yeah
A	yes that's right
B	mm not quite what you had in mind
A	no er but then I
B	yeah
A	and it filled the cup and she said is it alright I should have you know done some an education on it some education on it and she said is that alright cos I really want to learn and I said
B	mm oh well that was that was nice of you
B	yeah
A	you know
A	every that's
B	that's what you'll get every time
A	every time
B	unless you go in and say
A	mm
B	er and macchiato is like a mini cappuccino
A	yeah yeah right exactly
B	you know
B	er or that that assumes she knows what a cappuccino is
B	yeah that's just as the Italians say
A	yes dirty water
B	which is which is their slang word for an American coffee
A	okay no no that's right
B	to the Americans who order it
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	if you ask for an Americano you just get a
B	you get the equivalent of
A	a very liquid a very diluted
B	a long sort of coffee drink
A	yeah
B	and they they pour milk into it
A	and that's
B	you know that's
A	held in some contempt is it?
B	that that's the one they mm often call
A	but you wouldn't ask for
B	well er no I mean as a joke
A	right yeah
B	you know I mean
A	okay
B	I think it's well understood that this is what the tourists
A	right
B	not not necessarily the Americans
A	no no that's right
B	but this what tourists want
A	that's right yes
B	but but an but an Americano is is on the menu in a bar
A	it's on the menu
A	that's right
B	it would be like I can't I
B	it is a bit like erm you know you you may as well get erm instant coffee pour boiling water on it
A	yes
B	and pour the milk in
A	yeah I mean
B	cos that that's that's
A	that's right that's right
A	I I can't remember in whether in Spain there's an equivalent of an Americano as such
B	oh right I don't know I don't know enough about Spain
A	I I think you'd have to ask for
B	well
A	I don't even know they'd have one
B	heard that?
A	an ordinary coffee
A	no no no no
B	you know and it's a
A	can I just have an ordinary coffee
B	I I know I know exactly what they mean
B	you know just an ordinary coffee you know
A	that's right exactly
B	but
B	may not be known on the continent what an ordinary coffee is
A	exactly I mean their
A	you know surely is as respectable a notion as our
A	but okay yeah
B	I think that's a classic just an ordinary one
A	I think what you should have is an Italian go into a bar in Britain and say can I just have an ordinary coffee and
A	and
B	oh god well er I mean
A	well coffee
B	oh yeah definitely I mean I agree with you entirely erm and I mean if you go into some of the big chains er it's ridiculous some of the variations that they offer and then
A	yeah
B	they they don't want to use terms like small medium and large do they?
A	no no they're in it
B	I don't know what they are is it tall or
A	that is ludicrous
B	whatever it is
A	that's right
B	yeah
B	yeah you know yeah
A	and I think that's
B	it's all seems a bit pretentious to me
A	that's right I bet the
B	which again you don't see say
A	no
B	in Italy or I imagine you wouldn't see it in er
A	well that's another question
B	Spain
A	do they offer you different sizes?
A	yeah
B	but that's just two of them
A	sure
B	you have to ask for that
A	right
B	I don't think you often see it written up on
A	no that there are different
B	on the wall
A	sizes to be had
B	no
A	that's a very Anglo-American type of thing isn't it?
B	uhu
A	I mean
B	and you don't see too many coffees to go either because the er the assumption is that if you are in a hurry you you will have it in a nice bit of cutlery but at the bar and you'll knock it down and say thank you very much pay your bill and out and out you walk
A	well yeah that's right that's right that's right
B	yeah
A	but here routinely
B	yes or or to go or drink in or
A	that's right always yes
B	but I think coffee drinking here is something when you look at some coffee shops I mean that have opened up in bookstores or
A	yeah yeah
B	there there is material to read
A	well yeah
B	and you talk about wi-fi
A	yeah oh yeah
B	and all have their coffees with it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	coffee in Britain is more than it is for a lot of Italians I'm not saying Italians don't go into a bar
A	mm
B	or or or a
A	yeah that's right
B	and they go
A	that's right even if they're
B	yes
A	they'll they'll order together or
B	mm
A	one of
B	mm
A	they'll stand at the bar
B	yeah
A	they'll drink it and then they go off again
B	and you've got very experienced baristas
A	yes
B	who can knock these things out very quickly
A	that's right that's right that's right
B	they're not fiddling with the dials or
A	that's right
B	or anything like that
A	that's right that's right
B	they know where everything is
A	that's right
B	they've got er they've got two what I don't know
A	that's right
B	nozzles is that's not the word for it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but then they've got two or more nozzles working and they knock these things out
A	true true
B	quite quickly
A	that's what you could have in your new kitchen if you go down that
B	oh
A	a Gaggia machine taking up the entire half of the wall
B	yeah you mean add about four thousand pounds to the cost of my kitchen
B	mm and think of how many people would be knocking at my door
B	I just happened to be passing
A	that's it passing by
B	but it's a cul-de-sac for god's sake
B	oh really?
A	oh do I smell coffee in the air? yeah
B	it's a shame
B	you retired
B	yeah you could really
A	saying you know
B	yes but I'm I I think some of them would be cheeky enough to be saying but I thought you'd like it if you bought the students round for a seminar
B	in your living room
B	you know
A	my own cups
A	it's like you know no washing up that's
B	keep your hand in
A	that's right
B	yes
A	but it apparently it turns out those things cos you can get them for the house
B	yeah
A	for you know
B	I know
A	for domestic are just appallingly temperamental
B	are they?
A	and difficult apparently that's right
B	oh right
B	well I'm glad you've put me off
A	I
B	cos I was just rushing out to get one well
A	cos you've got the water pressure issue apparently
B	oh really? well the water pressure's not brilliant where I live
A	mm
B	telling me of the official change of some reservoir to a new reservoir
A	oh right
B	and telling me that er no assuring me
B	that the water was still good to drink and there shouldn't be any change in
B	taste
A	well they
B	might find it quote
B	a little harder
A	oh right this is cos
B	which is not good news for your your
A	yeah that
B	washing machine
A	that's right machine
B	or dishwasher and so on
B	if it's getting much harder
A	is well known to be
B	a hard area
A	you know a centre of water aficionados and cognoscenti cos they
B	right
A	turn on the tap and they say mm this is not the same reservoir
B	no
A	it's it's
B	and it's not yes and it's not from the north side I can tell by the
A	no it's the
B	temperature
B	this is the south side it's a
A	it's it gets a lot more sun
B	it's a might too hot
A	that's right
B	oh yes
A	well it's very good of them but I haven't had any such communication
B	well you obviously they haven't changed your supplier well it's not it's not it's still
A	right
B	but they are
A	right
B	you're
A	right right
B	getting it from your your bog standard reservoir
A	that's right
B	you've always got it from
B	but you see people in
B	are more discerning so they have to
B	change the reservoir where we get ours from
B	there's there's been there's been blind tasting of the water
A	yes I think probably just the the incidents of dead dogs er in your old reservoirs has reached the
B	adds a certain
B	dare one say body
A	piquancy
B	yeah
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah well there we are
A	I shall look out for that I I shall see what er
B	well if I were you
A	they have to say
B	I would be writing letters of complaint to
A	saying that
B	saying
A	well why have I got
B	why aren't I getting a new reservoir?
A	the old reservoir? that's right
B	mm
A	come round doing
B	yeah
A	looking round the bathroom and he you know he was perfectly you know sensible and he said to me first question er do you have high pressurised water? and I thought oh god I I don't I have absolutely no idea
B	well I no I wouldn't know what what the definition of that was
A	well it's just
B	you know I mean there is it's it's either highish or lowish or something but there there's no
A	mm
B	it's just like saying
A	or you haven't
B	but
A	that's right
B	pressure is a matter of degree when does it become high pressure?
A	well maybe it also er
B	oh right
A	when you're
B	well what difference
B	would it make?
A	well I suppose the I can't imagine
B	three thousand pounds
A	anyway
B	as to
A	er it
B	what he was gonna put in
B	mm
A	well the tank's around here and he went and looked at the tank he said
B	mm
A	oh yes yes you've got high pressure
B	mm
A	of course this could be an entirely made up question with a made up answer just to you know wrong-foot the client
B	oh let me just check oh it's got an engine
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	but but
B	yeah
A	you can imagine it being semi veridical like you know
B	well yeah
A	er if the electrician asks you er are you on AC or DC here?
A	okay okay you'd know that
B	yeah yeah
A	was a kosher question
B	yeah actually I think if somebody asks me that I'd think well hang on if I'm not high pressure what's that gonna mean?
A	yes
B	and I might be worried then if he said
A	that's right
B	oh well
A	oh well
B	you can't have this that and the other
A	that's right
B	you'll have to have a bog-standard shower
A	yeah
B	rather than one that comes at you from
B	twenty-two different angles and
A	that's right
B	you know and
A	yes
B	and a bidet will be no good at all
A	oh yes exactly
B	unless you've got high pressure you know
B	cos water has to go up that way
A	that's right
B	you know
A	but it
B	yeah
A	would probably be the other way round wouldn't it? so ah well if you haven't got this it'll cost you a lot more
B	ah well
A	we or if
B	that's what I mean
A	you have got X it'll
B	then we have to tone it down
A	way you answer
B	we have to tone it down or it'll kill you
B	you go in that shower you'll be dead
A	that's right
A	well I shall see how that plan pans out
B	well you must let know how this works out
A	I well
B	cos I've never known before I I've been asked about hard and soft water
A	ah okay right
B	but
A	right
B	I've never been asked or heard about high or low water
A	pressurised water
B	well no I don't know I I'd
A	it it I I may be
B	mm
A	doing him a disservice here he may have said do you have a pressurising pressurising
B	oh
A	boiler
B	ah there is
A	make any more sense?
B	there is such a thing as that yes erm that that's where I think it might be something to do with where you turn the
A	no it's not
B	he didn't mean that?
A	no it didn't mean that
B	oh right okay well I give in
A	but that could only be a gas thing
B	erm well I don't know there are new there are taps now apparently that you can have by your sink
A	yeah
B	and they do hot water cold water or or boiling water instantly now how they do that
A	that's just
B	must be some kind of special
A	okay if it's a Hadron Collider spin off
B	well I yes it could be yeah
A	this is probably how they got the science funding for it
B	you mean
A	it's got it's got
B	we make
A	impact you see
B	you mean your kitchen might might be the discovery post Higgs boson
A	yes
B	kind of thing?
A	exactly
B	yeah yeah
A	the science foundation in the European Union could fund such a thing
B	well
A	but if it didn't guarantee impact in the real world what's the point of it?
B	well I I of all the most unlikely places where string theory would be verified
B	or negated I never thought of it being you know your kitchen
A	but but think how many households often look for string in these times
B	and they can never find it
A	can never find
B	when they need it
A	yeah that's
B	no
A	why you want a Hadron Collider in the background
B	yeah well
A	it's gonna find your string for you
B	that's gonna cost more than nine or ten thousand pounds though I suggest
B	it could take more than a week or two
A	yeah
B	to put in
A	that's
A	amount of digging the road out
B	mm
A	underneath
B	or that would that won't be a discomfort for you because
A	oh no
B	because you would be at the centre of it
A	in the centre of it
B	I assume it'll be
B	bit of a problem even worse than the trams
A	all your
B	being
A	that's right
B	I think it'll be a bit deeper and longer than that
B	yes that's right
A	well we shall see about that but yours
B	well
A	would probably come first if it's
B	yes and I can I can erm er report back on high water
A	well it
B	low water pressure and goodness knows what else
A	it may well be that if I
B	if it's er yeah
A	still haven't got something done I shall approach you again
B	oh well you can by all means
A	and if you find out if you
B	come around and have a look at it and see what you think and you know whether it's worth it and all the rest of it cos I'll er it'll all be done and dusted by then should should be finished by the erm
A	start of term
B	end of end of the first week in September
A	brilliant yeah
B	okay? see you later on
A	okay cheers matey
B	thank you for the coffee
A	my pleasure
B	cheers mate
