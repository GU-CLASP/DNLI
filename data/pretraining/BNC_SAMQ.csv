A	and all this
B	that is awful
A	and says and she'll say to her stuff like you sure you want to eat that? and like stuff like that
B	that is atrocious
A	yeah
B	cos I've complimented her before and like I genuinely do think she looks nice
A	yeah okay
B	erm how does Ten Rules for Sleeping Around sound?
A	yeah whatever yeah
B	I'll read it out to you so there's an engaged couple gets some advice on staying together from non-married friends it's okay to sleep around as long as you follow the rules
A	yeah okay
B	yeah?
A	sounds like a disaster waiting to happen
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's true
A	erm
B	yeah
A	sees it more
B	does she not like eat properly?
A	from what
B	yeah
A	but like when
B	that's so awful to come from your mum as well
A	mm
B	why would you say that to your child though? especially like no matter how old you are
A	do you wanna grab
B	it's very you're very impressionable aren't you?
A	yeah
B	and girls especially are a little bit more what do you want me to grab? the
A	er yeah that
B	erm impressionable especially from your mum like
A	but like
B	I bet she doesn't
A	but like the thing is like I just
B	thanks
A	don't understand her like
B	thing is she probably doesn't wanna talk about it because she's ashamed at the fact that she lets it get to her but also at the fact that it's her mum
A	yeah her life would be easier if she just spoke to people but she doesn't
B	well maybe we need to approach her more
A	yeah I'm not bringing that up
B	or just said
A	I don't want
B	no no but
A	mm
B	it's like are you upset about something?
A	yeah
B	so maybe if you coax it out of her she might be
A	mm
B	she's gotten worse then
A	no
B	bless her though that is awful
A	mm
B	I was gonna say she doesn't see him very often does she?
A	no cos he works away all the time and then obviously her mum's like that with her
B	that's so sad
A	it would be weird wouldn't it?
B	mm
A	I mean I'm not particularly close to my parents but I've got a good relationship with them
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? like me and my dad don't see each other very often but that's how we both prefer it like
B	but you still get on when you see each other
A	yeah as long it's not that we prefer not to see each other it's just that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and just knowing that they're there for you for support as well
A	well your mum has her own problems with her weight doesn't she?
B	mm
A	so I always make a conscious to say to her when I see her like have you lost weight? like I
B	yeah
A	like
B	when I saw her for the first time down at the hospital I could see it but I think that was also due to stress
A	mm
B	she looked I'm not gonna lie and it's not to be nasty but she looked awful when I saw her but that's obviously just the stressful period I could tell she hadn't been sleeping she hadn't been eating properly like she just looked a bit drained
A	yeah
B	she looks much better now
A	mm
B	cos I'm not saying this nasty but my mum does genuinely look
A	filled out
B	plump yeah
A	yeah
B	it's it's her body type it's how she looks healthy
A	yeah
B	just brings life into her
A	no she's not fat
B	I remember once when we started doing Wii Fit together at first it was fun
A	yeah
B	you look at her and
A	she's got to be the size she is to carry her breasts
A	fucking hell
B	yeah
A	but like she your mum I know it bothers her like cos I've heard you tell me before and I've heard some some of the stuff she says and stuff like that and I'm just like it's and when I know people are like that I always make a conscious effort to tell them like you look really nice today like
B	yeah
A	or when I first see them have you have you lost weight? like
B	mm
A	it were the first thing I noticed
B	yeah
A	but just cos she's short she's more conscious of it
B	it looks different
A	yeah
B	cos I feel I've gotten much better with mine I mean I haven't had any problems any incidents since I've been here
A	yeah
B	I haven't had a single problem
A	good I'm glad that you've told me that
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I was wearing my shorts and I was just getting changed and pulled my top up and
A	mm
B	so I had to tell her but I think since then like since I realised and then I actually saw myself I was like oh
A	mm
B	no no it's just not attractive
A	I'm not really wanting to bring it up with you cos obviously when you told me you were drunk so
B	that's the only time I tell I tell anyone
A	I know but that's why didn't wanna bring it up cos
B	yeah
A	I didn't want you to feel embarrassed or
B	I didn't tell
A	well
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and he always has come into the bathroom or shouted at me and be like what the fuck are you doing or something and I'm like it's cos I'm ill like calm down
A	mm
B	but he's been really really good about it
A	it's not healthy
B	it's not
A	and you've got nothing to worry about there's nothing wrong with your body
B	exactly
A	I know that myself
B	but it doesn't seem to be a problem now I'm hoping that will stay
A	it'll just be the stressful environment you were in
B	yeah I think
A	at uni
B	I think it was that more than anything and
A	it'll be a million stuff and
B	yeah
A	I'm worried about my mum and her eating habits cos she didn't eat a lot anyway and now she's this has happened with
B	it can either go two ways isn't it people will either stress eat or stress starve
A	mm
B	well
A	she doesn't eat a lot anyway she
B	that's just where you have to come in I guess
A	like you have one she has one meal a day and she don't even finish her meal like
B	and without making it into a problem or sounding nasty or anything I think you just have to keep an eye on her
A	yeah
B	and make sure that it doesn't become a problem
A	yeah
A	it's alright
A	it's such a weird colour it's like brown and then black and white and it ends
B	oh I'm sweating so much out here
A	I know it's so hot
B	have to go in
A	yeah
B	oh
A	fucking started that one off now
B	I know
A	I hate chickens
