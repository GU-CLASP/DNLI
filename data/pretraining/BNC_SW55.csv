A	Chinese chess
B	er yeah I kept my old case but the software inside is quite erm
A	is new yeah
B	is quite fast and
A	is this working this time?
B	yeah
A	good
B	erm
A	I need to once I
B	sporadic but
A	once I do these contracts I need to scan them in I don't really need to print as such it's just
B	er scanning might it will scan but er it it it will scan but not directly off it will use that to scan but I'm having to run it off this but it can still scan
A	yeah yeah
B	there was a problem with it
A	alright as long as it's through the computer or whatever I just need to scan oh you've got Kelly Brook again
B	yes
B	indeed
B	yes yes it wasn't a her better month
A	she looks quite old there
B	er her nicer month was last month
A	yeah
B	because she's
A	she doesn't look so nice in that one
B	no er
A	yeah that one's not bad
B	yeah
A	is that your old calendar
B	yep
B	that's why I keep her I keep it er I threw one of the years away cos it wouldn't fit on there and it was like the the
A	yeah
A	that's a nice picture of the house
B	yes
A	where are my documents?
B	oh
A	and I'm still sleeping in there?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	there's that
A	student loans
B	that's your card but erm
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah that that erm is is all in there
A	the student loan stuff is in there is it?
B	yeah there's a bit more student loan probably here
B	sorry there's a bit more
A	okay
B	and there's a bit of student loan there
A	anything else?
B	erm
A	cool
B	and it wasn't erm ah
A	I'll have a look through it and make sure I've got everything
B	Lloyds bank is that yours? something about an overdraft facility? or is that mine?
B	no that's mine
A	yeah that's
B	or is that yours?
A	Mr
B	no that's you
A	that's mine yeah
B	er
B	so that's your University of
A	oh yeah don't need that
B	yeah that'll be mine
A	everything should be up here
B	I've gotta download some photographs and send them to work
A	is that for work? terms and conditions Barclaycard
B	you mean what the PPI?
A	yeah it just was
B	I think if you'd have pressed it you will probably if you had put it through a if if you put it through one of those PPI erm ambulance chasing companies they will take about a third if you're quite happy out of principle to say well
A	yeah
B	they'd take thirty percent of it but
A	I was just it was made more complex by the fact I was in a different country
B	yep
A	had I have been here I'd have probably done that but er
B	well yes cos I think I think they've got a standard response in that it everyone sends a letter
A	yeah
B	and just accept it
A	well they were quite cheeky as well I'd actually just before this whole process asked them to up my credit allowance my credit limit
B	right
B	mm
A	so I got like seven thousand seven hundred
B	mm
A	so at that point I was
B	yeah
A	to kind of stop me
B	it
A	I can't be certain
B	it's nice to have that as a cushion
A	yeah I don't really use it and then if you don't use it they start trying to take it away again and it's like why?
B	mm
A	why take it away? I mean I might use it
B	I'm trying to use it yeah
A	I haven't done anything wrong
B	yeah
A	so then my overdraft has been cut thank you very much
B	mm
A	so that they've just lost a customer basically
B	mm
A	it didn't cost them anything to allow me to
B	if I was you I would I would I would keep some I wouldn't close it down
A	yeah
B	so I'd just keep it there
A	yeah I mean I er yeah
B	cos if someone ever
A	yeah
B	so always it doesn't it doesn't cost you and it will you'll have to put effort to close it so don't just leave a couple of quid in there and let it run
B	erm yeah it's okay
B	yeah well
A	no
B	but that's her own neurosis erm erm in principle I'd say it's a good idea because you can save yourselves money like if you erm I said to her look join my premier because I she pays for gold and I pay for
A	yeah
B	fuse with mine and you save yourself the money of paying for the gold account
A	yeah
B	yes
A	and like I'm gonna get my final pay now and they owe me August pay and a bonus month's pay like my severance basically
B	yeah
A	so that's effectively four payments between the two of us
B	yes
A	and I was saying to them look could you not just pay us August pay and my severance pay
B	yeah
A	into one bank account at the same time?
B	yes yeah
A	therefore costing me thirty pound in fees but now I'm having to pay a hundred pound in fees no a hundred and twenty pound in fees
B	yeah
A	thirty for each of the four transactions
B	yes
A	it would just be easier if we
B	yeah well if she's up for it I would go for it
A	yeah I'm pretty sure she is
B	cos it's makes financial sense
A	pretty sure she is
B	so you you'll be proofreading I guess
A	proofreading?
B	what is it you're doing for this er this little job?
A	ah with the recording?
B	yeah
A	yeah I just explained to
B	yes
A	yeah it's not it's kind of done through them
B	okay
A	corpus being body linguistics
B	yeah yeah
A	language body of language
B	mm
A	and then they use that corpus so you can come up with a phrase er let's think of er an idiom for example it's raining cats and dogs
B	mm
A	we now all have these words in the database so any phrase that I wanna search the frequency of in the language I can type it in and it'll tell me out of one million words how many times does this occur? what position does it occur in? so they've now managed to find out like which words are the most commonly used
B	mm
A	all this kind of things and it's been useful for ELT textbooks like teaching English textbooks
B	mm
A	and all this kind of stuff
B	mm
A	and the learners like to hear you know that when they hear this version and this version do we say thanks or do we say thank you? well
B	mm
A	thanks is seventy percent more common than thank you
B	mm
A	in British written language
B	right okay
A	so I'm getting these it's pretty good pay I'm getting paid eighteen pound an hour
B	that's good
A	for every hour of recording I do is eighteen pounds
B	yeah
A	now I have to at the end I have to go back obviously if I'm recording friends get rid of anything incriminating
B	that's yeah
A	get rid of anything where there's background noise
B	yeah
A	in the car
B	well we had er did we have the windows open or did we?
A	no we had the windows done up so it should be okay
B	oh right
A	outside is too windy to do it
B	yeah yeah
A	so it I have to do some more work afterwards and I fill out consent forms and all this kind of stuff
B	okay
A	but you know it's about an hour and a half's work for every hour
B	oh right
A	you get paid so it's not bad
B	no not at all well it's all all helps doesn't it
A	I mean it's kind of the perfect job for when I come home really
B	yes definitely
A	I was quite pleased to get
B	oh I'll show you that er thing I was on about like what what I showed to
A	what thing was that?
B	this
A	okay yeah where you can search for the flights
B	no er
A	have you got a bin in here or a shredder or something?
B	er I'll I'll
A	alright I think it's all shredding
B	that's all the planes at the moment in the real life that are around
A	oh wow
B	that's quite frightening isn't it
A	yeah
B	so if you go like here
A	does show you though that when you're a bit paranoid about the plane crashing or something how many there are
B	yep
A	oh there are a lot of planes
B	that flight there is
A	yeah
B	that's er
A	Indianapolis to
B	yeah
A	Stansted
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so it's outbound it's obviously gonna curl round
A	do a loop and land?
B	yeah er er it's er oh no it's actually er what? no that's it actually that's it should have landed it's come in
A	yeah it seems to have gone past the
B	yeah
A	the airport
B	so I don't know why it's doing that er
A	maybe he can't land
B	let's see where this is going
A	there are quite a few plane's coming in
B	yeah
A	it's cos you're double clicking click once
B	oh right
A	there you go
B	yeah
A	surely that other one's to JFK too or somewhere in the states
B	yeah
A	yeah that's a nifty piece of software isn't it
B	that's and so I tried to so what I did was I
A	presumably it's got like a five minute delay on it or something
B	I
A	oh uhu
B	loads there and I was coming over and and tracking
A	you were trying to
B	I was trying to find it but I couldn't with the numbers that you gave me
A	no
B	cos you can use this
A	like type it in
B	type to to to find the plane
A	no yeah I came
B	like this one here is
A	I came on on that exact route I came up kind of across this way and then over that way
B	yeah
A	it's going to Ulan Bator
B	so it's going to
A	Mongolia
B	yeah so it's going to um
A	yeah from
B	yeah yeah
A	from Ulan Bator
B	yeah
A	what about this one?
B	that one here?
A	yeah
B	er
A	not the
B	yeah yeah god knows
A	it's going to
B	no idea
A	mm
B	by erm just seeing that it's passing over us
A	it's pretty impressive isn't it
B	erm yeah I put my Sat Nav er when we went to France France I actually got it to work on the plane
B	they were just literally just moving like that
A	and you're allowed to have this on on the plane?
B	yes
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so er yeah
B	so you can use this er but I couldn't get a er I couldn't get lock on with er er when I came back from France I had it locked on at the airport but as it started to taxi to take off I lost the signal and I couldn't get it back
A	oh gone
B	so that was it but I think I was er lucky that I was able to get it cos I'd tried the year before and I I
A	mm that's nice
B	that was actually quite interesting because but
A	yes
B	for god's sake
A	she's thinking it's going to
B	yeah yeah the cogs it'll break
B	bless her so that's quite funny
A	all good
B	right I'm going to get I'm going to get changed
A	yeah
B	and er you can see your
A	I mean I do do have something to scan downstairs actually
B	yeah
A	oh right we're not gonna scan the actual thing
B	no just
A	Cannon
B	it it's malfunctioning I I'll try it now just to see if it will work but it had been
A	yeah I need to fill out some documents and then scan them in
B	let's see what happens
A	is this my water? mm
B	yes
A	I thought so
B	right I think we'll go through all this but then it will say erm unless it's fixed itself
A	so you actually haven't finished getting Game of Thrones have you?
B	no
A	have you got one to watch later or?
B	well yeah erm
A	what do you watch it with
B	er no I don't watch it with
A	it's not working
B	cannot scan for these reasons
A	no
B	so I've not bothered trying er I've tried half-heartedly to get to the bottom of that so in order to scan now er just go to erm control panel
A	there's always another way round
B	er view devices and printers
A	you're a Windows 7 aren't you
B	yeah
A	have you seen Windows 8?
B	yes I've seen it but I don't particularly like it I've got
A	I've got it on my new laptop
B	yeah I've got it on erm erm a pirated copy
A	mm
B	like everything I have is virtually pirated
A	it's actually okay
B	start scan
A	although it takes some getting used to but it's not too bad
B	yeah I suppose it's just like everything really isn't it
A	they've made it more like a mobile phone though
B	oh right
A	you know with all these apps and
B	yes
A	whatnot but it it looks nice and it I guess for me cos my last laptop ran so
B	well yes
A	poorly but this one runs quite nicely
B	that's quite sensible
A	I'm pretty sure I gave you this to give to
B	er
A	wasn't this your cousin? or someone was gonna take it?
B	yeah never did cos I er er in fact I er
A	cos I mean I don't I don't want it
B	I know it's
A	I'll have that Cadbury's Milk Tray though
B	when I said when I find it yeah I can I can throw it then because I know it's in here somewhere
A	these are nice cupboards aren't they? nice and
B	yes yeah they're not bad
A	so it's
A	everything that you've erm you said I can borrow has that been arranged? you've like put that aside?
B	er no no we'll have to we'll have to er erm do that with
A	alright what size is the table that you said?
B	er well what we'll do is we'll talk about this while we're having our tea
A	yeah okay
B	erm where the hell has it gone? I've
A	I've got the list with me so we can run through and see er who's definitely got that stuff
B	okay
A	if you haven't that's fine
B	let's go to would it be there? downloads no I I'm not sure where it'll have gone
A	what is it you're looking for?
B	er that's the scan that I just did
A	oh right
B	erm cos when you're gonna scan
A	yeah I need to know where it goes
B	exactly
A	are you still studying French?
B	er Spanish as well at
A	really
B	right that's it
A	can you put a shortcut to that folder on the desk maybe?
B	eh?
A	on the desktop
B	er let's sort by name refresh saves view extra large now where's it gone? imported pictures
A	so you need to find that folder so maybe go up one
B	um
A	cos you're actually inside the folder er no that takes you back doesn't it you don't want to refresh
A	er maybe click on this drop down thing
B	mm
A	or back to libraries yeah where did you come from
B	mm
A	just before this? and what did you click on?
B	it's in libraries so it's gonna be in my
A	what was the folder called again?
B	erm yeah it's there
A	okay so go back on that one
B	there's your card
A	yeah
B	so if I keep that minimised
A	if you go back here
