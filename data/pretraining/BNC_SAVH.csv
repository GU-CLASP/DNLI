A	so I'm l I kissed a girl once and it was nice
A	she had very
A	full bodied as well
A	so
B	well
A	yeah okay
B	at what point would you erm
A	are we talking Weakest Link
B	in your
A	or Deal or No Deal?
B	and your well I don't I don't really
A	or Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
A	because
A	you answer questions every time an answer is correct it moves up er in the you know amount of money you can win but if anyone gets a question wrong it all goes back to zero and before a question is asked
B	so when you
A	you can say bank so it's technically working as a team but it's also very individual
B	like cricket?
A	no more individual than that as in basically the benefit
B	Hunger Hunger Games
A	of working as as
B	The Hunger Games?
A	yes
B	right yeah
A	erm and you basically
B	so communism?
A	it's like a very capitalist version of communism
A	yeah erm
B	well I guess then you wouldn't have much difficulty
A	and basically before so you but the main thing is just you answer a question and you want to get it right because if you get it wrong not only does it take the prize money back down to zero for that round
B	yeah
A	but also at the end end of every round everyone votes as to who gets knocked out that round
B	oh so surely you just
A	so it's a cross between picking
A	oh that person got the most answers wrong
B	people who are going to be better than you you want no
A	no no that's the thing is that most people at the beginning vote for the people that get it wrong but beyond that cos you
B	oh my goodness it's
A	in order to get you know the money up
B	yeah
A	cos if you just had people getting it wrong then you would never do well you'd never get the money
B	yeah
A	and then towards the end then it gets tactical and like I think that person might
B	oh my goodness
A	you know try and oust me
B	but
A	next time so I'll vote for them and hope that other people do as well and then of course when you vote for someone else you're erm
B	you're like and if they don't go out
A	if if they don't if they don't go out then regardless of your performance they're gonna be like oh but they voted for me I don't like them so you're gonna vote for them to get out it gets weirdly personal and spiteful and stuff
B	whereas Deal or No Deal
A	and not only
B	is just harmless fun
A	not only is it is it just like oh if you've got the question wrong I'll vote for you because before you ask before the question is asked a person can say bank and if they say bank then
B	they get all the money?
A	no then all of the money gets saved so let's say five questions in a row were answered correctly as they went round
B	so you get say five hundred
B	but is it is it
A	five grand
B	exponential?
A	at that stage it
B	okay
A	it does get exponential let's say it's five grand erm and
B	to share between your
A	a person a person says bank
B	okay yeah
A	then that five grand is saved so that they have five grand that round regardless
B	yeah
A	but then it goes back down to zero for that question
B	but that question could be really easy
A	yeah in which case if it is easy people are like oh you shouldn't have said bank and then you know we could have gone up from five grand to you know ten grand
B	mm
A	so it's tactically banking because obviously if you don't say banking and you're high up and you get it wrong then it goes back to zero but if you say bank too early then you're gonna look like an idiot because you could have gone higher
B	yeah
A	erm and then basically the person at the end who when they get to the last two then they have a sudden death so whoever gets the question wrong first loses and the other person gets the prize money
B	so the chances of you actually winning this game are pretty slim?
A	oh very slim like it's not it's not even about it's not a hundred percent about your ability erm in quids kind of cos you can be really good and someone might tactically be like I don't want them in the game any more because they're gonna cause problems for me so they'll try and vote you out
B	goodness
A	yeah it was vicious and Anne Robinson
A	was absolutely vicious
A	like she was just so brutal for no reason it would be like so
A	you're a
B	you're a
A	zoologist
B	you're a plumber?
A	from Bristol?
B	not exactly brain surgery is it?
A	and you'd be like why are you doing this? so that's
A	not exactly a very specialist field now is it Chris? and Chris is just there like like what? why? Anne why are you doing this?
A	do you get some kind of kick out of this? and the producers every time like Anne can you please you know tone it down?
A	the insults
B	Anne just like okay
A	and she's just there like no
B	she's Richard
A	continue coming onto this programme I will continue insulting them
B	she's basically Richard the third isn't she?
A	she is she is a more malevolent Richard the third I'd say
A	and that wink every time she was like you are the weakest link goodbye and then wink and it was just
B	really?
A	yeah as in like it wasn't a wink as in like a aye kind of wink
A	it was a sort of like you're the weakest link goodbye and it
A	I don't know how she did it but it managed to even as a viewer like suck the soul out of you
A	you were just they she'd be like you are the weakest link goodbye and you'd kind of just sit there and be like I need a hug
B	so let's say you're on erm oh you're on er
B	no I was gonna say Deal or No Deal
A	oh Deal or no Deal? great okay
B	which is more harmless
A	well that that
B	contributory yes
A	so I'm I'm on Deal or No Deal
B	erm
A	with
B	the scenario is
A	Noel knobhead Edmonds
A	offers yes
B	er okay so
A	he does
B	the banker's given you and offer of
A	I mean the banker in
B	ten thousand
A	Deal or No Deal it just
A	no he just he gives outrageously low offers
A	every time it's just they're like yeah so you've got rid of everything under the ten grand limit except ten pence and one penny and the banker's like I'll offer you two hundred
B	would you do it by gut instinct or by er working like by probability?
A	if you win by probability it's kind of a hollow win and it's like because it's hugely unlikely that you'd win big big by probability
B	yeah
A	if you're working entirely mathematically you'd probably end up with like a five ten grand kind of prize you'd get some money and it's good money but there would come a point halfway through the show where everyone would be like yeah yeah no he's doing really well and you'd be like yeah I'll take the ten grand thank you bye
B	yeah yeah
A	everyone'll be like what? no go for the big prize you can still have the big prize and you're like statistically no
A	gonna stick with this but if you and if but there again yeah if you go with the gut instinct and you win then that's just the most incredible feeling it's just
B	it's like squaring a last minute goal in FIFA
A	it's a little too soon mate
A	the wounds
B	well as as you you
A	haven't quite healed over there for that
B	I shouldn't because erm because you don't you beat me so I'm sorry
A	yeah kind of no you don't have to apologise I'd do exactly the same thing
B	you don't go
A	what was I said the other day when I was like going up to the shop can I buy you some FIFA ability? I do exactly this we both do this
B	but not a huge
A	yeah but I win more often so
A	you should definitely enjoy the sport a bit more
A	erm do you want the M and M cookie by the way?
B	are you gonna chuck it out if you don't?
A	I was gonna eat it but if you want it
B	no eat it no no no I'm fine
A	splits? yes that's a yes
A	but I've already broken it
B	okay
A	saying this is an M and M cookie broken for you
B	thank you
A	which side do you want?
B	er the one that I reached for
A	like great
A	wonderful mm so you've been avoiding this question and other people would take that as a subtle hint to not talk about it but I'm gonna carry on anyway because
B	that's
A	true subtlety
B	is it mm
B	anyway anyway yeah what?
A	how's your love life?
B	fantastic question
A	yep I know
B	and I think the correct and proper witty response would be what love life?
B	what love life?
A	what love life? what? love life?
A	what love?
B	what life?
B	what? love life
B	that works best to me
A	what love? lie
A	what love
A	words
B	I tell you what Benedict Cumberbatch was seriously good in that wasn't he?
A	mm he's an incredible actor
A	in a Shakespeareanmanner until Hamlet and he was
B	yeah
A	fantastic in that but in fact I'm no I'm I'm gonna go ahead and say I think his Hamlet performance was better than his Richard the third performance but this is in the context of him being incredible in both I preferred the Hamlet performance yeah why not?
B	yes
A	he erm
B	oh shall we?
A	what?
B	I was gonna ask do you want to do erm book for Midsummer Night's Dream? or do you want to
A	oh
B	turn up on the door and get it? oh we can't it's a matinee isn't it? do you wanna go to the matinee?
A	erm yeah I mean yeah why not?
B	or wait till Saturday and go on the door?
A	I'm working on Saturday unfortunately
B	oh that's alright
A	erm are we not allowed to go to the door on matinee?
A	if we're not what?
B	if we're not going on the door it's like it's probably was it over ten pounds?
B	that's quite I don't think I can
A	I I don't have that kind of budget for this next week or two
B	mm
A	I'm fine with going to the door and then if they don't have tickets
A	just yeah if they don't then that's fine
B	okay
A	tell you what
B	yeah
A	yeah so we walk into town if they have some on the door we enjoy a fantastic performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream
B	indeed with er the Royal Shakespeare Company
A	indeed and if they don't
B	there you go good idea so either way we're
A	yes
B	great
A	wonderful teamwork what team? Wildcats
A	nailed it erm yeah yeah
A	what? High School Musical?
B	yeah
A	er
A	High School Musical as propaganda
B	I don't know all the haven't read all the theories of
A	no no certainly
B	the immediate
B	I can't yeah so the theories of media and the
A	stop stop I do not I'd I don't give a toss about critical theory at this stage secondary sources I want no citations or references
B	so just
A	I want your
B	pure
A	I want your opinion on the matter
B	my opinion is that
A	uhu
B	of erm western
A	yeah
B	which is firstly not representative of the entire world
A	uhu
B	and therefore whereas it's obviously culturally constructed and it's trying to it is holding up a picture of society which because it's not representative is propaganda
A	mm
B	for a certain way of living and for certain attitudes
A	I would agree entirely but
B	okay well I could
A	I agree entirely I think it's a very interesting theory that you consider it propaganda and I'd agree with you on it I think that you
B	not saying it's not nice to watch
A	oh no no it's it is nice but that's kind of the point is that it's
B	mm
A	overtly nice to a point where it isn't representative it's absolutely not I mean if you take a look at the the yeah that looks perfect if you take a look at the
B	mm
A	it's that he just is too good at everything he's too good at sports and
B	mm
A	er singing and his academic studies
B	so he has to choose is is that it?
A	so he has to choose where where to go from there
B	and
A	does he take up a scholarship in a
B	yeah
A	sports university? or what
B	yeah
A	and then beyond that
B	yeah that kind of thing
A	it's erm er
B	actually
A	no no that
A	yeah
B	and it gets young people inspired to be to do well in life
A	oh yeah but it does also kind of imply that to do well in life you erm kind of need to go into wait no how does it end? I I would suggest that it does imply that
B	he's he's with his friends isn't he?
A	the route to success is university
B	yeah
A	is college yeah
B	and he also stays with his friends
A	yeah
B	mm
A	in High School Musical unfortunately
A	refer to it as status quo which it's absolutely not and it's an infuriating
B	are they saying are they saying you
A	so
B	the satire of it?
A	so the song in itself
B	mm
A	erm has the lyric in the
B	yeah
A	erm and and then the
B	okay obviously
A	erm which obviously
B	supposed to
A	is flying
B	yeah
A	completely against the direction the film the musical is trying to take it which is embracing who you are
B	okay yeah
A	and you know your your passions as opposed to the social construct that you're meant to fit into
B	but
A	which is a positive
B	yeah this is very
A	film in my opinion
B	yes very good er just a side tangent on
A	yeah
B	yeah have you have you say any more about that have I stopped your main point?
A	no that that was kind of the main point was basically that it does have a good direction the film and
B	yeah yeah I I entirely agree
B	mm
A	and you know harmful but yeah what what were you going to say?
B	I was going to say that our is been brought to my well er one argument that I've been thinking about recently is that our passions
A	mm
B	are merely socially constructed
A	oh
B	you for instance the guy who's in it baking
A	yeah
B	has got into baking not because he's somehow intrinsically erm made for it
B	he's come out of the womb he hasn't come out of the womb with a spatula in his hand he's come out of the womb into a family where either baking is like really prized and he's adhered to that
A	yeah
B	or it's really shunned and he's found it from some role model and he's got it whereas his basketball is what his family wanted him to
A	I think textually there is not a lot of evidence for that
A	but
B	none from
A	but if we're going
B	none from High School Musical
A	if we're going
B	but like this is my opinion
A	if we're going beyond textually
B	this is my opinion of life generally
A	okay I I agree with you to a point
B	okay
A	I agree with
B	I that I am thankful that you do
A	I
B	to a point
A	I agree that that is definitely a way that it it can be seen and also a way that it happens especially erm the kind of polar opposites of er something being loved and kind of like worshiped within a family that sticking to it or something being shunned erm because I think especially within the young teenage years erm what parents champion and love and also hate and kind of
B	yeah
A	erm rebelled against by young teens but at the same time I would say although your viewpoint is one way it does happen I would also say that there are some things that people have a passion for that isn't erm directly caused by familial or friend
B	yeah that's good
A	or social constructs
B	and I'm pleased yes mm like erm example being
A	I mean you you could look at it broadly and say that everything er is caused by social construct IE that family is really into football the son likes playing golf they're both under the umbrella of sport and because the family
B	uhu
A	love sport that's the social construct I think you can get very
B	yeah
A	passion
B	in in which case it would have to not be an art as in it would have to not be something with a set of rules that you have to learn from someone
A	what what?
B	because because
A	no no sorry you'd said it
B	it can't be it can't be so it can't be erm a musical oh it could be a musical instrument if they taught it themselves
A	yeah
B	but I what I'm saying it can't be anything where someone has has to teach them the rules
A	but how far do you do you go with that? for example I enjoyed writing stories and writing creatively before I was taught it on you know a curriculum level
B	okay
A	but I read books so was I being taught by the author through that media?
A	then in the same way that that goes if someone just picks up an instrument and you know starts playing it are they not learning that instrument through whoever created that instrument?
B	yeah yeah good I like that yeah
A	I would er I would disagree with that purely because although although you're taking that from what I've just said what I've just said was reductio ad absurdum
B	okay
A	purely just for my own cause my personal belief erm beyond ruining you in that argument
A	erm my personal belief
B	no you've just helped my argument
A	yeah did it though?
B	it did because what I'm saying is that you
A	yes
B	in the same way that the guitar's constructed
A	and in and in saying that my argument has helped yours you have foiled our own argument cos I just
B	foiled your argument that was that was a different argument
A	no no I was
A	furthering your argument reductio ad absurdum is where you take an argument and then you
B	further
A	exaggerate it
B	yeah
A	until it's ridiculous
B	yeah but that wasn't ridiculous
A	it was though
B	that wasn't completely
B	ridiculous
A	to say that playing a musical instrument you're taught
A	by the person who made that instrument is utter bollocks
B	no I didn't say he was taught but it by it did I?
A	yes I
B	I was saying it had an influence on him
A	in reading a book
B	had an influence on him
A	in reading a book am I taught by the author and you said oh good point to an extent
A	now I said well in that case are you not taught by the creator of an instrument?
B	well we were saying taught as in
A	and
A	you are not though
B	you are because if they weren't alive the the the thing
A	you are not
B	wouldn't have been made
A	you are not influenced by the creator of the instrument you are influenced
B	no no
A	by the music that you're making with it
B	mm
A	is what is relevant that is the passion
B	is there really?
A	yes
B	but you have to have one in mind to be able to do the other you have to in order to create the instrument you have to know that it will make an art
A	you don't have to know
B	well you can't just have a block and erm another block on top of it you have to know that the strings vibrate to make the er
A	to make a noise
A	yes but to make an art no
B	why is it a strong oh no okay yeah okay okay
A	in the same way that you can
A	the exhaust is not made to make art the exhaust is made to be functional
B	and this helps your point in what way? sorry I've forgotten
A	my point
B	it's a brilliant discussion
A	my point my personal belief is basically that you it's cut off is
B	yeah
A	where
B	so the
A	in in my context in writing can be influenced by a book but it's not intrinsically so you can't so in in my opinion art can be a passion that is personal as opposed to socially constructed because you don't have to be influenced by another person
B	okay so in just sorry
A	that's okay keep going
B	in erm in er so in that line of thinking if there was a somebody who let's say just for fun hadn't come into contact with another person
A	uhu
B	erm
A	feral child
B	would would they have the ability to create art?
A	I think that art takes on a far more abstract
B	yes it would
A	definition here are you talking about art in the mind of the outsider?
B	erm as in the mind
A	or
B	as in
A	that
B	back nicely wouldn't it?
A	that is a wonderful point because that is saying it are again are passions inherently constructive within our society something that we're taught or
B	or can you have it without this is getting to the point
A	or is this something that the human condition is built upon?
B	yeah
A	is
B	are we humans or are we dancers?
A	my sign is vital my hands are cold
A	looking for the answers
B	for the answers no
A	yeah no the the question there the very crux of it is
B	mm
A	is are we an are are we subject to pure necessity or
B	or are we made for passion?
A	yes that's a gold star for you
B	and that is the subject of next week's lecture
B	think of a less prestigious university in
A	well thanks for that
B	I don't think
B	dunno
A	maybe
