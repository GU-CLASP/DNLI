B	oh her
A	yeah
B	is she still still arm in sling?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	oh nice
A	I think she was chatting me up
B	do you reckon?
A	yeah
B	maybe a bit of both
A	I was just
B	no I know but I was just think of er why she'd come over
A	well I like to think it was because I looked
B	I'm sure it was
A	I just look incredibly fit
B	yeah
A	such an unusual view
B	yeah
A	erm right
B	oh
A	oh
B	well yeah
A	erm do you want to do see if anyone wants to do with anything?
B	in some ways I wouldn't mind just sort of being in
A	well we haven't seen anyone for
B	true
A	relatively kinky
B	yeah
A	there are dotted about
B	I can text
A	there are a lot of XC90s in here
B	mm
A	they've
B	which one sorry the?
A	xC90
B	right
A	erm
B	wow
A	it is very old
B	mhm
A	these wheels are severely out of alignment
B	even in your Polo
A	no I was thinking more sort of friends rather than
B	yeah okay
A	or
B	or
A	or
B	true
A	yeah but it's a most it is an MPhil which is a kind of Masters
B	true
A	it's not taught is it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	A lot of the MPhils are taught for art
A	what?
B	this is the constant angle
A	can I have my er?
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	what would you like to do?
A	well not to er be a pain
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mhm
A	but I dunno
B	yeah well I I was thinking to plan for the next little while erm if we go back erm
A	erm entirely up to you
B	yeah I could  I could  get the ironing out of the way I suppose erm
A	I would really just like to sit down and have some ice
B	no definitely I
A	no I don't think
B	but yeah
A	well it was more sort of a wandering around the shops it wasn't hugely healthy
B	yeah
B	hmm
A	erm we could hit the gym and do some weights
B	tonight?
A	I'm tempted to leave that for tonight cos it is still sort of active and walking round
B	erm yeah
A	not too much yeah
B	not too much
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	it wasn't uninteresting it just wasn't
A	I know it was sort of
B	hmm
A	it was very subtle
B	it was
A	yes
B	erm
A	but you just sort of hit sit back and it hits you
B	yeah
A	mm
B	Cos it was chicken and rice basically
A	I I have also concluded come to the conclusion that I'm against having sort of the two cooked dishes I had in
B	ah right you had a sort of a selection er selection yeah
A	yeah it was sort of eh overwhelmingly rich
B	right okay
A	yes
B	oh
A	yeah
B	Cos you know it's not like it's this price for two it's just this price for all of it and
A	this is true
B	with our voucher
A	oh
B	ah that is only on Sunday and Thursday though unfortunately but I might be able to wangle another twenty-five pounds off
A	indeed
B	but erm
A	oh er
B	yeah
A	what the fuck are you doing out by yourself?
B	possibly out with this person
A	yeah possibly
B	that goal was in
A	you're getting drawn into an
B	put your foot
A	ow
B	okay?
A	oh can you work the clutch for me?
B	I'm not sure I can chuck
A	yeah just lean over
B	and poke it occasionally
A	the clutch or my leg?
B	the clutch I was thinking but your leg if that would help
A	at the moment I'm finding the idea of an automatic unbelievably attractive
B	oh there's that couple from Cambourne who get
A	where?
B	erm on the
A	okay
B	mm
A	my god
B	all from customer services
A	mm
B	did you see  Did you see
A	the other week
B	oh the other week right
A	that would be a good place to live
B	mm yeah
A	yeah I would be very happy if I lived there
B	yeah it's lovely
A	yeah look like it
B	okay so yeah so I'll do the shopping and the ironing in which ever order
A	oh
B	oh no it's not
A	park somewhere else
B	I'm just going to block the road
A	or at least if you're going to
B	yeah exactly no he was er
A	well but she obviously had had to get out
B	yeah exactly
A	erm?
B	I'm happy to do either like I said erm
A	er in some ways it might be nice to see people erm I'd be more inclined to say sort of ask Billy first
B	okay
A	well I well if you ask him today
B	yeah okay
A	presumably
B	well do you want to do that then?
A	maybe yeah I think just it might be nice to see him
B	maybe? Ah
A	and possibly
B	yeah
A	what's he been doing recently anyway?
A	mm
B	I don't think er anything massively surprising
A	I'm going to find these next few weeks quite difficult
B	I know you are chuck
A	yes
B	yeah I think the key is to make sure that you don't just end up getting bored
A	doing nothing
B	Cos I think
A	I will try swimming
B	oh do you think that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh I need to do that this weekend anyway when I  when I  get home
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Cos he might give you some interesting ideas for things to you know just for some variety
A	there's not much cardio you can do on upper body
B	mm
A	I mean there's the hand bike thing
B	that's true yeah
A	well that's cos our gym's got too many good things
B	mm
A	mm
A	yeah I know
B	the nurse did seem quite sympathetic to that she's sort of erm
A	doctor? Nurse?
B	the sorry the doctor in erm well the one who's told you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh and maybe erm go to the cinema next week
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes
B	I can er start investigating
A	I assume they'd tell us because it would be his chance for him to get more money out of this one wouldn't it?
B	well yeah exactly
A	mm
B	non
A	well cos er
B	if you didn't change?
A	so for example my parents before they signed up to fibre they had normal broadband and it was a damn sight better than ours currently is
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I don't really know how it  how it  works
A	phenomenal fibre speeds are about a hundred times better than what we're currently on as we're on about point four and they're up to forty
B	yes
A	what?
B	Joy
A	four would be an improvement
B	yeah four would be lovely
A	what?
B	well as in it's it's a definite project that's going to go ahead
A	and where to get the information from
B	exactly
A	see I have yet to find this website
B	well we went on it
A	I've well I think I found it once and have been unable to find it since probably
B	well what was it? Oh since yeah
B	ah
A	ah
B	it's alright chuck
A	no it's not
B	I know but get it go back
A	I know
B	oh yes
A	mm
B	I love Amazon Prime
A	yes how long does it last for?
B	thirty days I think it was so I've still got a couple of weeks I think
A	I thought you already had done
B	I had but I'll just the check the page again
A	well not that much of a con
B	not that much of a con yeah
A	no
B	you can if you want to
A	no it's not worth it
B	okay
A	well they seem to have gone away from that
B	yeah
A	I didn't know that you were selling it
B	hmm? Nice
A	yes
B	yeah
A	it could have been a lot worse
B	it could have been an awful lot worse
A	no erm
B	yeah
A	erm in the sense of I think she behave she's a very different people around for different people
B	yeah she is
A	and to some extent it might be nicer if
B	yeah
A	but it's just interesting that I mean I think a lot of
B	yeah
A	I don't understand how you could drink like a fish in certain situations and then have absolutely nothing in the other
B	yeah
A	I it's weird
B	I agree
A	like last night I was really expecting her to have some wine with dinner
B	yeah a glass of wine like it's not exactly
A	yes exactly
A	mm
B	and she's very easily erm kind of erm angered by people doing stuff and
A	on like what?
B	well just like sort of cyclists doing something or pedestrians doing something or erm that kind of thing
A	really? When was that?
B	did you? Yeah like when we cycled into town she was really quite kind of erm on edge about and so you know there's lots of pedestrians just stepped out
B	hmm
A	as well but er anyway sorry carry on
B	and just and like just occasionally this week she sort of I don't know if I've just been moving too slowly or something but she's stormed off
A	fingers?
B	erm she picks the skin on her fingers and it's right back to basically to her knuckles
A	what?
B	it's absolutely disgusting
A	how did you notice that?
B	mm
A	erm could you do me a favour?
B	yeah
A	there's a big rock in the middle of the drive
B	yeah I see it
A	whenever we're there you can't get at it
B	yeah sure I'll I'll go and move it
