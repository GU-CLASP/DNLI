A	well it's yeah
B	that's
A	actually twenty
B	that's
A	doesn't begin to probably closer to forty by the time they've left
C	well if nothing else if that was paid off it does mean that they're not having to pay it off
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	so they gain
A	I know what you're saying about
C	immediately
A	yeah ultimately we would lose out of
B	yeah I just said purely financially I accept
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know there's an emotional thing so it's
A	and you know I couldn't give them enough to set them up for life
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah yeah well
A	but all I'm doing is is taking a black cloud from over their head cos let's be honest it's well I mean if
B	mm
A	it was like
B	but it to some degree it is meaningless debt they will never pay back eighty grand
A	no
D	surely that affects
B	they will pay back a chunk
D	if you're going to go get try and get a mortgage or something like that?
B	yeah they they're better off doing a deposit for the mortgage or even part ownership of the house
D	yeah but I mean the
B	that in your will bequeath it to them so there's no way
A	mm
B	they they will ever actually have to part own it with you
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	no one pays our tax bill we earn an extra pound and we only earn seventy-five P and then we get to the threshold and then we actually only earn sixty P
A	yeah
B	I feel that's quite a nice way of doing it
A	mm
B	cos it still shows them the value of money
B	it's not a big
A	yeah
B	whether they would truly appreciate it is a separate question but
A	yeah that's true
C	mm
A	it's a bit hypothetical
B	from Oxford for your doctorate
A	really we need to go and see a financial advisor cos we're not making the most of our money
E	that's what I'm aiming for
A	we really need advice on what even if just for a few years before we retire we could make it work so well it's not working for us at all at the moment
B	yeah and if you're gonna do that you need to
C	yeah
B	you're averse to shares
C	I play I play safe
B	yeah
C	tend to be fairly
B	erm
C	safe
B	and that's fine but you're
C	and
B	yeah but
C	if I'd taken more risk
A	but if you're doing well enough and you feel safe then
B	yeah
D	well if you take a risk and you lose your money
C	well that's right yeah
B	it's again it's not just about cos
E	mm
B	taking better holidays so it still might be that yes you you know you're happy with what you've done but it might be if you wanted nicer holidays
C	oh yeah yeah
B	you could have invested more riskily
C	yeah
B	I'm not pushing you down a risk thing but that is the very first question a financial advisor will ask you
D	I
E	oh the other one's best
C	it's getting the balance right I have got some stocks and shares and Isas which were up there they're down here at the moment
A	yeah
C	but they're starting to go up again so I'm leaving them there and eventually they'll go
C	yeah
A	not high risk
B	I think this is the kind of
A	but more medium risk
C	my share of of stocks and shares is fairly small compared with other investment
A	mm
C	but I try and push other investments around to get the best I can
A	yeah
C	like the erm the
A	mm
C	to try and get a better return so that's the way I
A	but this er you've gotta say on top of it as well if you we to a financial advisor and he says do this this and this
B	it only needs an hour every quarter
A	mm
C	people forget that that
B	mm
C	that you know they spend an hour where oh I can't be bothered doing this I'm only earning but actually you go to work and you'd be glad to earn that
A	yeah
C	you know spend a bit of time working on it you can earn a lot more than that
A	yeah but we'd need help
B	well and that's a that's an after tax
A	I wouldn't know where to start
C	mm?
B	that's an after tax gain as well
C	yeah it can be yeah
A	yeah but we've just sort of said I mean well we're supporting these and things there's outgoings and what have you
B	yeah
A	now is not the best time really to
B	no
A	once once these two graduate then
D	well then she'll come home and say I'm getting married in Coventry in the cathedral and I want to
C	in which case you say right you can pay for it
D	or at the
E	definitely not gonna happen
G	the coach and twelve horses
C	there's there's a friend of mine who reckons he can prove that the more you spend on the marriage the less likely you are to survive your future life as a as a married couple he reckons
D	well why?
C	looking
A	right well a two pound fifty elopement
C	but to a certain extent if you're
A	I'll give you the bus fare to er Gretna
C	yeah how many times do you hear do you hear of you know oh you know they how can they afford to buy a house and all the rest of it but they've just had a twenty thousand pound marriage
B	well don't confuse
A	mm
B	correlation
C	and this this
B	with causation
C	what sorry?
B	don't confuse correlation with causation
C	oh yeah no no no
B	so the church causes alcoholism
C	yeah I'm I'm
B	it's the main
C	I'm not blaming the
B	they link all together but there may not be one cause
C	yeah I'm I'm no I'm just saying well
B	yeah
C	but he was saying that he looking around his friends
B	mm
C	the ones that spent more on the marriages
B	oh yeah
C	have actually are the ones that have been
B	yeah
C	had problems and broken up
B	I wonder if there is correlation there a causation there
C	yeah
B	it could be that people who are bit more showy
C	mm
B	are less arguably authentic
C	yeah oh no could easily be anything
B	and want to spend more
C	yeah
B	but there's nothing more authentic than a marriage cos you get to
C	yeah
B	know someone warts and all
C	yeah
B	don't you?
C	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
B	say say nothing
A	oh yeah
A	warts and all eh
F	warts yeah warts and warts
A	pimples
D	where where's he got his warts
F	well would you like to know?
A	no actually no that's fine you just keep that to yourself love
B	I'll put a picture on Facebook later
A	oh dear
B	I mean the other thing to consider and this this again is in no way the but I was at a different part of life
C	oh that's definite
A	oh yeah yeah
B	you can't take too much risk now because
C	yeah
B	we go up you've got plenty of time to recover any losses
C	I've been your pain in your backside for ages but
B	yeah yeah
C	er who knows?
B	he's discovered
B	but
A	yeah
B	losses than you do
C	that's right
A	yeah and it's also we
B	so
A	I want
B	listen but
A	my money to work our money to work
G	oh sorry
A	we want our money to work because we're still at the trying to retire earlier so I want it to work to be a positive thing towards that and
C	exactly erm
A	so yours is much more
F	well
A	much more a preserve what you've got
F	and you've got children
C	mm
F	so that makes a difference as well
A	oh yeah yeah
A	well that's what I'm saying
F	and you'll have grandchildren plus we don't have
A	no
F	that
A	no
F	so we're in a different position
D	they're very expensive children
F	yeah
D	and grandchildren
G	yeah mm
A	oh yeah yeah
F	to
A	yeah
F	raised three children you've had grandchildren
A	mm
F	so it's
A	mm
F	very different
A	but this is why
F	if for everybody isn't it?
A	the position we're in at the moment like
B	mm yeah
A	yeah touch wood we're not
F	yeah
A	once we've well we worked out it's gonna be quite a lot of money difference each month
F	mm
A	cos it's like we give you eighty quid a week don't we?
B	so you are favourite aren't you?
C	yeah
F	yeah what happened there?
A	but that's you know that's quite a lot
B	mm
C	mm
F	mm
A	that's so a hundred and forty
B	well that's
A	probably
B	best part of eight hundred a month isn't it?
A	mm yeah
D	yeah but that's what
F	mm
D	families are for
A	oh I certainly I don't begrudge one single penny
F	no
A	of that at all
C	that's that's something that shouldn't happen
F	no
A	but if and when
F	good
A	when they both graduate
E	my money's gonna
A	that's a lot a month
F	that's gonna make a difference yeah
A	well if we if we're used to if we're paying paying it out
F	yeah
A	we could do a lot with a month yeah instead of
C	yeah
A	just letting it sit in the bank go so I think oh we could go out for an extra Chinese or something that and because we haven't had it for three years
F	mm
A	rather than just letting it sort of trickle in and trickle out again
C	yeah
A	that's that's a lump of money that we could do something with
C	you've a good chance of getting
A	a lot with
C	yeah get a reasonable return on something like that
A	mm
B	yeah
C	I presume you know the different all the different types of advisors you can go for?
A	I know look at this space it knows nothing
D	yeah well don't go to our
C	well
D	financial advisor we had
A	I
D	she was the most gobby
A	I've now exhausted my knowledge
D	terrible
A	of financial advice
D	telling us all about they'll erm the couple down the road that got divorced and
F	oh no
D	divorced they told them
E	really?
D	oh did you know they got separated?
F	it's not appropriate
C	yeah you've actually go to say go into a bank
A	yeah
C	will make money on you go to someone else that gives you free advice it'll be what they make commission on
A	yeah and the most commission on is what they'll push the most yeah
C	and they'd like you to but both cases they've got to tell you in advance what they're tied to
A	mm
C	but they the last time I did it years ago it was such a sort of quick sort of thing I are you happy with that? sign this form
A	see I have to be honest if we're taking about really this is this is sort of er quite a big thing for us is right let's have a look at what we've got coming in let's have a look at how we're gonna make it work for us now cos we haven't really in the past few years
C	mm
A	I want
C	yeah
A	and get the most independent advice I can and I know nobody's
C	if you
A	ever totally independent
C	oh no they
A	because even they even the ones I'm paying are still gonna get more commission from them from them
F	mm
C	well they
B	yeah they do
C	on the advice they're giving
A	yes but
C	so you can judge whether they're trying to flog you something that they're gonna make money on or whether it is genuinely independent
A	yeah but they can only I can only go on what they tell me
C	yeah
A	and they can
C	yeah
A	there could be twelve
C	oh there could be
A	twelve
C	yeah
A	and tell me well actually I get most commission on this but actually I'd promote that whereas that one could actually better for us but they get nothing
C	yeah
A	but I still think I've got a good deal
F	mm
C	yeah oh no they they
B	if you but but you're paying their wages so you can say thank you for your advice we're now gonna go away do our own research you've recommended
C	yeah
B	a with-profits life policy over twenty-five years you then type that into confused dot com or moneysupermarket dot com you get the full list and with the limited knowledge you've got you will see if that's in the bottom third you go actually hang on what are you doing here? and it might be
A	yeah but yeah but still
B	still the most appropriate for you but at least you
A	but like you said
B	go through that process
A	it depends what you're judging them on because if you're judge I mean the risk can be higher but the pay-out's higher
C	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm you know
B	yeah
A	so it might not be in the top third for pay-out
B	but er
A	but it might not be in the bottom third for risk
B	yeah
A	either
B	yeah but it forces that conversation
A	yeah
B	and if you get them to actually justify their recommendation and then it still makes sense to you having
A	but you if you're
B	gone
A	my my thing
C	right when you get nearer the time I'll print out what I can find on Which about investments and so on
A	mm
C	which is sort of what the types of investment are things like that the other thing is Money Saving Expert isn't it?
B	yeah
C	dot com
A	right
C	savings and investments and so on not I have found sometimes bits on his website are wrong but generally it's good advice and he will tell you what the best
B	well it's accessibly
C	with
B	written as well it's in English
A	oh good
C	yeah yes that's right it's very understandable and he also puts what the likely problems are and things like that
A	right yeah
C	but there's also a lot of fairly good basic advice on that website as well
B	and although it takes time
C	oh yeah
B	financial advisor will advise
C	mm
B	hoping he'll sell you some products
A	no
B	he's he's
C	yeah
B	salaried he doesn't care
C	yeah no he
B	you know he's er he's on a
C	mm
B	but say to him alright thanks for your advice we're gonna walk away now
C	yeah
A	mm
C	we need to think about it
B	we're like we're the type of people who like to consider things we're gonna walk away
F	mm
A	mm
B	thank you
F	I wouldn't sign anything there and then
A	oh no no
C	no
A	no no no
C	when I when I erm went in for advice I knew pretty well what I wanted to go for and she ended up actually advising what I wanted to go for so I was happy to to do it in the end it wasn't as crazy as it could have been but it was it was okay but I'd already worked out pretty well where I wanted to to head
A	mm
C	erm
D	yeah I don't think we'll find any fresh cups
A	see
G	you won't?
A	no thank you erm I keep oh actually
G	oh
A	sorry can I just have the same glass don't worry can I just have half a glass of water?
G	yeah
A	please thank you sorry dad
A	if I sit still then you
B	there's always I mean ring
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know just sanity check
A	yeah
B	what you've been advised
A	yeah
B	and
A	see I I
B	think
A	I keep thinking well in a way because we're both working is now the time to be a little bit more risky? because we still have still got a salary coming in so if that goes pear shaped we've got a security
B	yeah
A	at the same time
E	do you have any cans of cans of Coke and erm?
G	yeah we've got cans of Coke
E	yeah can I have a
C	to my mind if
A	mm so
C	you know say
C	yeah
A	safe as you know
G	er
E	sorry
B	don't there isn't one answer to this or
A	no no no
B	if you want to retire when you're fifty-five you have to go uber-risky and a financial advisor
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and your appetite for risk
A	yeah see
B	yeah in which case you are probably into reasonably modest gains working until retirement state retirement age if not further
A	seven
B	for both of you? sixty-seven is it? erm
G	we've got Coke and we've got
E	just have a Coke please?
G	mm
E	thank you
B	but your pension is actually really really good
A	no mine's shot mine's shot
B	yeah
A	pension
B	teaching pension
A	is shot because
B	right okay
A	I did the first few years that I worked full time I did a few years and then
E	do you want another drink?
F	do you mind if we we can have tea in black please?
E	yeah
F	in that erm piggy cup
E	this one?
F	this er thank you
E	yeah? do you want a drink?
C	I'll have a tea or a coffee whichever's going a cup of a specific
D	you can have a drink drink if you want I mean
F	I'm driving
E	this one
D	oh of course you are yeah
C	well this evening and tomorrow
B	thank you
A	erm no so
C	oh
A	at the moment is just gonna pay me about a hundred and twenty pounds a year
D	a year?
C	now what you don't blow it all
A	year a year so twelve pounds a year is not even a Chinese a year is it?
A	erm and then so then I was like starting superann back from scratch
C	erm tea or coffee whatever's going
G	which would you prefer?
C	erm tea I think
G	tea?
C	thank you
A	and quite soon afterwards I went part time and on maternity leave twice so and when I was working part time although I could have kept my payments up I didn't because we had part time wages coming in so my years of actually paying in full time
B	if you've got a micro pot I think they're called micro pension you can take that money and run you can close the account take the contributions you've made and run with it
A	this is it you see and and we've we've got all sorts of
C	well shift it
A	but we don't know where else to put it and we had a we've got an Isa
A	which is earning hardly anything
C	shift it
A	erm well this is it it's not
C	go onto Money Saving Expert he'll tell you what the top Isas are
A	mm
C	and what the the top savings are now a lot of them that get the best rates are either online telephone or postal rather than er the the
A	mm
C	bank but having said that some years ago I was talking
A	mm
C	so you've got to be sort of proactive in moving around
A	well this is it and we're not and I it's completely
A	it's completely our fault
D	I'm the same
C	yeah
D	I wouldn't
C	yeah
D	there's no way would I do online banking or anything like that because I wouldn't understand it
C	you don't have to
A	oh no I can do I do
C	you don't have to do it online
A	an online saving thing I wouldn't have a problem saving thing online banking
C	no
A	I wouldn't do
D	no
A	but an online saving
C	right
A	thing I wouldn't
C	no?
A	have a problem with that at all
C	no
A	I mean the to be honest with you we we pay into
A	when I was paying I was paying a friend cos you know you can get these erm park erm thingy park
C	yeah
A	so I did it but then when I got the vouchers they weren't for all the shops that I wanted to go and spend in
C	no
A	and I ended up with some vouchers left at the end
C	totally totally a waste of money
A	and I thought well this is ridiculous so then I said and I think I was given a
C	mm
F	mm
A	and then Christmas comes we just go and take it all out and it'll pay
F	mm
A	for Christmas
C	yeah
A	well we've been lucky enough that we haven't needed to and we're saying that we are gonna go and get a little bit out of it erm when the
A	but erm mm but so that's like another pot of money that's sitting there
C	yeah
A	and it's I haven't got a problem
B	mm
A	erm so it might as well be online cos we never
F	mm
A	actually
C	yeah
A	go and do anything with it it just sits there getting twenty quid
F	yeah
A	a month
B	well you
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	oh yeah
B	but be happy with it
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but at the same time recognise that you're gonna need that it of a kick up the backside
A	oh yeah
B	so if you put something on your calendar and reserve an afternoon every six months every even just once a year just to go okay what rate are we getting? when's it due up? what's the current rates?
C	mm
B	and if the current rates are within a half percent you just go
C	yeah yeah not not worth doing it bad time
B	yeah it's not worth the aggro whereas if you're the sort of person who is is proactive it's worth chasing an extra half percent as it comes up
C	mm
A	yeah
B	but you're not that type of person and that's
C	no
B	doesn't make it right or wrong
C	no
A	no no no no no
B	you know
A	yeah
D	we're not that type of person either
B	no exactly
D	and I'd
B	so you you manage your
D	I I like security I like to walk into my bank recognise the faces there or you can't recognise them all and erm
B	mm
D	I know exactly where my money is and everything
C	but but no harm if you got an account that's dropped enormously go into the bank and say right I'm not happy with this what can you offer me?
D	oh we do
C	and see what they offer
D	I don't go to another bank and do it
C	but
D	I go to the same bank
B	yeah it's alright
C	no but go down the high street and get all the brochures to see what other ones will offer you
A	yeah er see
D	yeah and then it's a fight to sort it out
A	I wouldn't my working account well my working account has been with Barclays since we got married our working account
D	mm
C	mm
A	erm and all the bills comes out of that and everything like that and having to change that would be a massive massive thing but savings
C	no it wouldn't
A	like our twenty pounds a month which I know is pittance but
F	yeah
A	that I would
F	mm
A	what have you because like I say we don't actively do
C	mm well
A	but saying that there might be a better Isa out there now that we could transfer it to but
B	actually just to correct you changing current account is about as easy as it gets it's you say that but
D	well but then
A	you've got to get all your everybody who's taking bills out
B	they they do that for you
C	no they've not got
B	you you got to
C	this agreement between the banks it'll happen within seven days is it?
B	yeah
C	they guarantee it all goes over otherwise it
B	the only thing yeah the
B	no the only things you will need to change are things like Amazon
D	and then you hear of of people having paying something twice
B	cos the bank doesn't know about Amazon
D	because something hasn't be cancelled
C	is that recent?
D	can't think when it was
C	because it's only in the last six months is it that this?
F	there will always be
D	oh okay
F	somebody
C	I think it's something like that
F	doing something somewhere that you'll hear about and then
A	oh yeah yeah
F	you know but unless you change
A	well
F	yeah
A	still have a tale about
F	yeah
A	something to complain don't they?
F	yeah
C	but no they now have an agreement between the banks so that
A	oh okay
C	they take it over and they
A	mm
C	but it is now done to make it it
D	you don't want that one?
F	that ended up under the couch
B	because the government wants you to switch transfer to to keep the banks honest
A	okay
C	the the the government I think told them get some system going to allow it to happen simpler or we'll kick you and the banks have done it
A	okay
C	I'm not trying to I can't prove it
A	no no no no
C	but er
F	no
A	well I didn't realise that does anybody mind if I have that last chocolate shell?
F	oh no
C	I'm sure that you put it down down there
G	that alright?
C	yeah that's fine yeah
B	I mean if you're thinking about these sort of things it sounds like excuse me offering your time without conferring with you first
F	cheers thank you
B	I'm sure
C	yeah
B	and if you said we're looking at Isas ask
C	no it's
F	thank you
E	alright
F	is that the decaff?
E	yeah
F	mm
E	yeah yeah
F	thank you
B	you know and don't take it for gospel it's
C	oh no I was gonna say you know anything you do you've gotta
A	mm
C	erm makes it clear check with the actual company don't believe what he says on his page he always provides a link through to it
A	mm
C	and so on
F	I think a lot of the like we did a Isa that was quite a good rate but then the next year it fell and it's like
C	oh yeah
F	like zero
C	mm yeah
F	we really need to move that don't we?
C	yeah
E	I need to drink some Coke mum
C	what I don't know whether you've if you've got Isas
E	sorry sorry
C	erm be aware that if you want to transfer it you can't take the money out yourself and then put it in cos that means you'll lose the Isa cover for that money you've gotta get your new Isa company to transfer the money over for you so you open a new Isa get a transfer form for them which you fill out the details
F	yeah
C	and they get the money from your previous Isa company to move over and that way it preserves the the interest free aspect of the Isa
B	and it doesn't use up that year's allowance of
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	doesn't it use that that year's allowance
A	I was gonna say cos we were only allowed to put so much in anyway
F	yeah
D	yeah that
B	but
C	if you transfer it all within the Isa wrapper then it doesn't count at all as a as a contribution though
A	oh okay
F	mm
B	but most people don't come near their annual contribution anyway but
A	no
F	mm nowhere near
C	but one problem though is that that some of the best Isa rates they won't take new money in they'll only take what you're
A	mm
C	doing in that year you can't transfer from another one so it's a balance then of is it worth taking a lower rate being able to transfer your old Isa? or is it the case of get the better rate and
A	mm
C	leave your old Isa where it is?
B	and that's where you get all sorts of shenanigans
A	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
B	you know so
C	er
B	you've gotta balance risk with what you actually want to get out of this with
A	we just er to be honest with you at the moment we'd we really need to sit down with somebody and say this is what we've got and him say and I know it's you know it's not his word is gospel but
C	yeah but
A	him say well look this this really isn't working for you
C	mm
A	this is okay that you really shouldn't be doing
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and if you know and sort of know our long-term goals and say I would
C	yeah
A	you know
C	yeah
A	about anything that's out there
C	I yeah
A	and and I know that what we've got isn't working most effectively
unknown_female	mm
B	the thing to do is talk with
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	cos it's no good saying I want to retire on a huge
A	oh yeah yeah absolutely
unknown_female	mm
B	but you know so you've gotta have a sensible idea erm
A	mm mm
B	if you go round with all of that
C	mm
B	and you'll get good advice out of them
A	oh no no I mean we I think we know
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	let's say not exactly I want this product and that product but we know
B	but they will ask about all sorts of
C	and it
B	insurances as well cos this
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	they love to sell insurance
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	and insurance all it insures you for is the cash flow associated with the incident so if you can afford to replace the blender
A	yeah
C	Which's advice is always if you can afford to pay the bill don't have insurance
unknown_female	mm
A	yeah
C	so basically if you
unknown_female	get all the sort of these insurances for your washing machine and all the rest of it
A	no we never get any of them
C	it's overall not worth it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	because if you can afford to pay the bill that repaired it but obviously you can't afford to repay er build your house again if it burns down
A	no no no
C	so you're insuring your house cos that's
A	you've got to have house you've got to have house insurance haven't you?
C	well yeah if you've got a mortgage you have to
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and even then it only has to be
C	er
B	content er buildings
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	but you wouldn't be
A	oh yeah yeah
B	you need some insurance
C	yeah
B	the financial advisor will talk to you about is erm critical illness
C	yeah
B	erm disability home protection possibly erm what else is there?
A	but you see both of our
B	you see if we're talking about
A	I'm sure both of our
F	yours will the teaching pension
C	you
F	and I'm sure
A	got some aspect of
C	you you might I I don't know for sure but you might even as a teacher have insurance through your work site
C	in my case I didn't have life anyway but you know it's a case of that was always er covered by the
A	yeah
C	so I didn't need anything like that er
B	that's only whilst you're in the service of the
C	whilst you're in service
C	oh that's right
A	yeah
C	yeah oh no once you
unknown_female	you've come out then you need to think alternately
A	mm mm
C	for the time being
B	yeah
C	you may be you'd have to check up
B	but the nature of life insurance because it's a lot cheaper when you're younger
F	I'm sure
B	yeah
A	mm
F	cos you do
A	oh yeah
F	yeah
F	oh yeah
A	than he is alive
B	yeah same here
F	same same with
A	way more
B	I think she wants me to go paragliding
F	wow we could live together can you imagine?
B	mm yeah but
F	how much trouble we'd get into
A	how many hats could we try on?
A	oh my goodness
B	but you don't need to live somewhere you just need to have somewhere to sleep between the shop opening hours
A	this is true
A	yeah no
unknown_female	mm
F	mm
B	specifically is is a lot cheaper when you're younger
F	it's why he doesn't talk to you in a nasty way
E	yeah yeah
F	yeah
B	and the premium typically stays the same
A	mm
B	it might actually be cheaper now even though you have life insurance to get life insurance now at a relatively low premium and
A	yeah
B	because now you've got the money to afford a premium that really doesn't actually you don't need
A	mm
B	but again that's where a financial advisor should give you some advice and he'll give you a quote for the insurance and you make your own mind up
C	it's whether they actually
C	need the life insurance though because
B	yeah yeah
C	you know if you
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	er an insurance lump sum to the other
A	yeah
C	then you don't need to pay the insurance
B	after a typical funeral bill of about five to eight thousand
A	mm
F	oh don't
C	yeah
A	no mine's gonna be way cheaper than that
B	yeah I think
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	which I think probably makes sense cos it's getting a bit
E	oh cos you don't want a big thing?
A	sorted it everything's going to be donated to medical research anything they want they can have
B	mm
A	and whatever's left is put in a cardboard coffin
B	mm
C	can I echo exactly what she said for me?
A	I want a cardboard coffin are you listening?
C	and all this is written down somewhere?
E	yeah you've said it about five times to me
A	good
unknown_female	yeah
E	and you want people at the whole
A	yeah
E	and you want people to celebrate your life rather than mourning your death
A	what are you doing?
C	yeah
E	I remember what you said
A	what are you doing?
E	I'm not dancing
A	didn't ask you to dance I asked you to do a reading and

unknown_female	yeah
C	the next year we discover there's this extra global warming cos of the pollution in the atmosphere
unknown_female	yeah
A	that'll be me
unknown_female	exactly
B	that's great
unknown_female	yeah
A	well we had
C	yes
A	we had a conversation actually
F	I think it's better
B	it's an open question
C	oh no I'm I'm going on
E	I think it does
C	erm
E	cos I think it depends on what the person wants
F	yeah
C	down in
F	yeah wants yeah I think it's does
C	cos she died just before Christmas they delayed it for a couple of weeks then they didn't have a funeral they had a celebration of her life
F	yeah that's lovely
C	and it was a lovely gentle church service
F	yeah
C	where people just read bits and so on and yes we went off to the crematorium afterwards which
F	yeah
C	was sort of the serious bit then back to her house where it was not totally party but we were laughing
F	yeah
C	we were joking
F	yeah
C	and chatting and so on
D	see
F	yeah
C	and there was a lovely moment when the phone rang and er
A	that was
G	mm oh that was yeah
C	I think it was
F	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
C	and we all burst into laughter
F	yeah
C	and her son didn't know what we were laughing at
A	ah
C	cos he's quite serious
A	ah
C	but that was a lovely you know it was it was sombre and so on
F	yeah
C	in many ways
F	yeah
C	but it was still a happy occasion
F	respectful
A	but you still
E	yeah
A	you still say your goodbyes don't you?
C	that's right yeah
F	mm
A	I want
unknown_female	yeah
G	you not made an impression?
A	I
C	I'm
A	yeah well this is it you see
A	you can celebrate the effect that I've had
A	no I the thought of of everybody sitting there weeping and wailing and
C	yeah
A	oh
C	yeah but it
E	cos you can't remember anything
C	started about the history of the erm
B	it's the first time in her life she's been short
C	family home at
C	and she'd written that and then they they persuaded her to expand it a bit and she wrote what what she called The Diary of an Ordinary Person was a lovely little title
A	yeah
C	which then
A	yeah
C	and that that was so nice that
A	I hate I hate the thought of I think because hopefully I'm quite a positive person I hate the thought of people remembering me and them all
B	it's alright
A	but
B	you need to know the thought of people remembering you
A	I hate
A	yeah
B	but half
A	no but that's it that's not me
C	well
A	I'd want
C	it'll be all

C	so there was him
A	yeah
C	just for about three days at the end of it that was magic

C	what sort of funeral is that? just is that a very basic simple
B	that's average of what people spend
C	oh yeah that's the average of what people spend
B	it can go down to about half of that
C	I was gonna say it it's like the marriage thing you can get married for two hundred pounds but they quote fifteen thousand pounds to get married that
A	but seriously they can blow lots
F	yeah you don't need
E	yeah
F	more than that
A	give away medical can have anything you want take but it won't be fit to have I suppose
A	but
F	yeah
