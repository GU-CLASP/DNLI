A	oh maybe she's a thief
B	yeah so I really wanted it bad
A	ah
B	and I think it's it's the it's got to be done
A	you've got to get rid of
B	yeah so I'm gonna ring
A	no
B	so
A	nice
B	yeah
A	so what's so what was the issue with the tax then? The tax from work?
B	I'm on the wrong fucking tax code
A	ugh
B	yeah
A	how do you know these things? How does one know whether you're on the wrong one?
B	um cos my if it ends in an M it's mm week month one week one or some at like that
A	yeah?
B	the tax office believe that that's what I'll be paid every month for the rest of the year
A	yeah
B	no
A	mm
B	so that's bullshit
A	that is a bit shit
B	mm
A	it must be said
B	like at Christmas I got my I got like three hundred pound bonus or something
A	mm
B	lost seventy quid of it
A	huh?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	quite the rebate
B	and cos we keep hitting our budget I should be potentially getting a hundred pound extra
A	mm
B	which is better than a poke with a sharp stick
A	in your eyeball
B	in my eye in my eyeball
A	as opposed to up your bum hole
B	yes
A	in your peen eye
B	yes in the penis
A	oh does it feel nice?
B	yeah
A	right
B	no it just reminds me that it's there
A	ah
B	which isn't fun
A	that's not a lot of fun
B	I really want yeah I really want my phone back
A	that's what happens when you invite boys to your house that you don't know
B	I know
A	and you leave it in your bed
B	no
A	before you left the house?
B	no
A	I like this one the best
B	oh I like that one
A	the rest of it is a bit take it or leave it but I just wanted a long necklace
B	I think it's really pretty
A	and it was just fifty P
B	what?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	I got this one for fifty P and the other one for ninety-five P
B	I love charity shopping
A	get
A	oh
B	yeah
A	is it of Mickey Mouse
B	probably
A	maybe I should just go to the Co-Op
B	huh?
A	maybe I should just go to the Co-Op
B	well we can just go to Co-Op
A	yeah
B	that is an option
A	as an option
A	but with the pasta
B	mm
A	I could make  I could make carbonara though if you get I've got cream in the fridge but I need it for the thing that we'll make tomorrow
A	cake
B	cake
A	we probably should have made cake for your tea but then we would have eaten said cake
B	and had nothing for the mother
A	and that's why I was a bit scared about putting the fizz in the fridge
B	prosecco
A	yeah it was like that Prosecco but it's called  as opposed to
B	oh
A	so it's sort of it's ten pounds a bottle and it's very rarely on offer
B	ah
A	it's nicer than just getting Cava
B	ha
A	I looked in the shower earlier I still had red marks on my arms
B	ah
A	from my freaking basket
B	pained
A	everyone had the death wish today as well
B	ah
A	and it just fucks you off cos you think just look
A	who reverses and doesn't look?
B	do you know
A	people that don't want to live
B	yeah or people that are on the roundabout cut me up like they're going to go into my car and I'm thinking how can you not
A	well I think they just  they just  don't know
A	in terms of the rules of the road though?
B	yeah
A	like you're you always know where you're supposed to be
B	no
A	people just go for it
B	people just taking the piss
A	there are far too many  far too many  cars for the roads
B	er the first year I lived here I wanted to move away
A	yeah fine
B	when our
A	mm
B	why? Cos it doesn't function as a city
A	yeah
B	and it doesn't work
A	it doesn't work
B	yeah but I think once you're here you get sucked in
A	that's what happens  what happens
B	well
B	I dunno he can email it to my email
A	yeah or my phone
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I bet it's gonna be awful
A	it's gonna be chavtastic
B	yes
A	it would be pretty bad
A	aw bless
B	I'd just do it
A	I think I might
B	I'm that's a really big bear bug for me of mine and think is one as well
A	yeah I know
B	oh I really think And ah the worst one oh do you really like my new top? Yeah it's great I bought it today
A	mm
B	yeah
A	ah
B	brought and bought are different words like
A	yeah they have very different meanings
B	for
A	something something like that
B	some it
A	or or with my friend
B	can't be asked?
A	asked
B	how weird
A	very strange
B	the number please
A	um

A	nine nine nine
A	all of the nines
B	yep

A	it's a good one
B	O seven seven one seven seven one seven one seven one sixty-nine
A	all of those
A	and it sounded about five sevens
B	ha yeah
A	and then wondered why she couldn't text me because this number doesn't exist
B	mm mm
A	and obviously on this it comes up as a little conversation
B	oh yeah saved it
A	she replies I don't get it
B	the crazy one?
A	the crazy number
B	oh my friend
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so when so she presses reply it doesn't work because it goes to the crazy number
B	what?
A	she's like I'm kind of nestled but she'd done all her hair and she was ready to go
B	ah
A	I know
B	ah
A	can you remember the days when no one had mobiles and you had to meet at Woolworths at exactly eleven o'clock
B	yeah
A	you had to be there
B	and the panic was if you weren't then you had to try and find a pay phone and you've got a number written down half your arm
A	where could they be? Awful
B	ah
A	those were the days
B	have you got twenty? You'd pick up twenty Ps
A	horrendous wasn't it
B	I remember you used to have to get off the train
A	oh no way
B	and wait for them to come
A	oh
B	well it's only like a five minute drive but still
A	yeah that's true yeah
B	mad
A	what a bitch
B	yeah
A	oh wow girls
B	aagh
A	I I don't know how people lived
B	uh-uh
A	I um made the mistake of when I first moved to uni um I didn't tell people that I lived that the name of the village that I lived in
B	yeah
A	so it's completely redundant
B	right
A	fine lovely
B	yep
A	erm
B	no
A	so she'd gone straight on the train
A	and I was waiting at the train station for about an hour and a half
B	after the flight
B	can you imagine?
A	so she got to sample you know the British rail and which I'm sure is a delight at rush hour
B	yeah
A	with a massive backpack
B	yes
A	smelling
B	yeah after a massive flight
A	having been you know when you sleep on people's floors for a week
B	yeah
A	so she well didn't really speak to me for most of that night
B	yeah
A	yeah it's quite bad yeah
B	that's pretty serious
A	what a twat
A	who doesn't tell someone who's coming to stay where they actually live? Here's your first challenge
B	it's like when you stay with friends
B	it's like that
A	I'll see you in a week
B	Good luck with that
A	all of those addresses between here and Brighton
A	what a pillock honestly
A	she'd have no idea
B	do you know? My
A	mm
B	erm I was living with my friend
A	yeah
B	and so
A	she didn't?
B	yeah
A	shit
B	erm
A	how big is the village?
B	mm
A	that's pretty  that's pretty  intense
B	it had three pubs
A	yeah
B	have you got it  have you got it  oh my God is it Mickey Mouse?
A	I can't but where is it meant to be
B	I have no idea
A	I don't know what that body part is
B	ugh
A	my phone goes mental whenever you turn it
B	oh yeah we're loading
B	it's just there you go
A	you might have to press load
B	play
A	what is it?
B	erm it's very neat
A	it's really detailed isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I think if you erm if you touch the screen when it's on there
B	that's pause
A	er
B	where is that?
A	play
B	right
A	where could it possibly be? Cos what is that?
B	knobbly bit
A	do you think that's his that's the top of his arm?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	who the hell has done that?
A	and why would you have it there? You certainly wouldn't have it there cos that's a mental place to have it
B	I'm gonna say where is it?
A	like if we look at the angle that the photo's taken at
B	that's a tee-shirt innit
A	it must be the top of his arm
B	yeah
A	like that bit
B	yeah
A	tell him he's a freak
B	I just
A	in the nicest possible way
B	I see what you mean though
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no he's pretty skinny though isn't he
B	I dunno
A	well it's not his leg though is it? I mean that would be a weird place to have it as well
B	on your knee
A	on your knee yeah
B	I don't remember seeing that knobble on his shoulder before
A	erm
B	I don't remember that
A	just from knocking on doors?
B	yep
A	wow
B	I mean
A	okay
B	er yeah I think it took her about an hour and a half
A	Jesus Christ
B	yeah
B	top arm
A	top of left
B	I love it
A	two hours? Christ
B	it's really nice
A	it's lovely
B	has it? Er no
A	that's his number isn't it? Oh
B	I don't know
A	well presumably that that's his number
B	erm yeah
A	I don't know why
B	mm
A	the last time this happened and they said they were gonna send on er some questions you know about some for me to provide my feedback
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's the worst thing
A	and you've you've paid months bill for a phone that you can't actually use
B	use yeah
A	er well yes I erm I would have put photos on
B	ah
A	I haven't put any photos on
B	how did you just put that on then?
A	erm I put those on with Bluetooth
B	ah
A	no it's a little bit illegal
B	that's brilliant
A	erm a website called Tubidy
B	so did you have to type all the names of stuff in?
A	I just put in the name of a song
B	oh
A	erm cos this one I really wanted to listen to cos it's on This is England
B	I haven't seen that
A	it's good actually
B	mm
A	it's quite good
A	yeah you just go onto the website and then type in a song that you wanna listen to
B	oh
A	but what I wanted to do is make an album in there and just move them out so that it doesn't say download
B	put it on in the right place
A	so it doesn't know you've downloaded it
B	ah
A	I know it's pretty clever man
B	yeah
A	I just
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yep
A	please believe me when I say that
A	it's been fun
B	it's been great
A	Don't call us
B	yeah
A	no one's having any fun anymore
A	right
B	yeah what what do we need to do here
A	I need to eat some food
B	yeah
A	maybe we should go
A	well probably all we'll do is buy mini eggs
B	I know
A	Cos that's all we ever do when we go to the Co-Op
B	yeah
A	which is fine
B	tea
A	someone asked me when I was saying yeah no I'm just living on fish finger sandwiches
B	yep
A	on a good day
B	right
A	but everyone else
B	hi
D	you alright?
A	you alright? Going out?
D	nope
B	we are too
A	we have no list
B	yeah
D	I'm getting beverages
A	are you going? Are you drinking in?
D	yep
A	were you meant to be going out?
D	yep
A	what's going on?
D	long story
A	you alright?
D	no not really but
A	I might just turn this off
B	what's not happy?
A	what's going on?
D	erm
B	yeah
D	it's no more
B	shit
D	mm
B	oh dear
D	no she's talking
B	mm
D	so it's been
B	yeah I can understand why she wouldn't
D	mm
B	yeah
D	mm
B	I I would still expect that reaction from her
D	mm
B	yeah
D	yep
B	as long as she knows you're at the end of the phone
D	yeah no she does know that
B	no she's probably be numb for a couple of days yet
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	it's really really weird
A	God
D	yeah
D	yeah
B	the worst thing you could do
A	she'll talk to you when she's ready
D	mm
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	but when she comes to you just listen to her and don't don't forget about it
D	mm
B	and so maybe a few months down the line
D	mm
B	it might upset her and she'll be really angry that you don't understand that she could still be hurt by it
D	mm
B	like she'll keep it forever and ever and ever
D	mm
B	just er yeah sit sit tight
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	I wasn't gonna go to the shop but I'm going to the shop now
B	the bath? Have you been in the bath?
D	I have been in the bath
B	probably not wise
D	no I'm gonna buy a four pack and that's it
B	probably better than you know
D	yeah
B	tripping on your own vomit in your sleep
D	my weekend's just gone to pot to be quite honest
B	mm
D	it really has
B	is she staying in?
D	well that's if she stays in
B	I'd tell her to stay at home if it was me
A	mm
D	but if I tell her to stay at home she's gonna think well why does he want me to stay at home
B	no she'll
D	mm
B	but hypothetically if this is true there is no way she wants to go out tomorrow
D	yeah
B	and any get out of jail free card she's gonna take it like full
D	mm
B	have fun
D	I'll probably see you in a minute anyway
B	okay
A	um a cow on a stick?
B	A cow on a stick
A	mm
B	yep yep yep yep
A	all that's happened is she's had her period
B	no
A	but then how can you be pregnant?
B	she yeah she
A	she's a miracle
B	I think the way she's described it to him
A	what it er I mean I've heard about there being spotting you know in the early days of pregnancy which is why some women don't realise they're pregnant for months
B	mm
A	but actually having a period when you think that you're pregnant is completely ridiculous
B	well she's yeah she's saying that the her last period was two weeks ago
A	nope that's bollocks
B	yeah
A	there's just no way that you can be pregnant in that amount of time
A	she's a fucking weirdo
B	yeah
A	it's just like
B	yeah
A	you can't and it's in that amount of time there's no way
B	no how could you possibly
A	there's absolutely physically no way
B	yeah
A	and there's no way you could possibly be pregnant in that  in that  amount of time
B	I sound bad but I wanna say to him how does the how could you explain to me how she's explained this to you cos I don't really get the chronological order of this
A	no right well there isn't
B	like she's taking the piss out of him bad
A	yeah
B	to throw that on him
A	there's but there was no fucking baby
B	no
A	and to see him
B	I know
A	what's happened is she's probably a bit upset that she's not pregnant
B	yeah
A	she's not lost anything
B	yeah
A	she's comparing herself to the trauma of some other woman having to lose a child
B	yeah
A	which you can't even imagine how bad that must be
B	no
A	I think she's disgusting
B	isn't she
A	Cos she's
B	that's why I want to sit down
A	mm
B	for him to see it
A	mm
B	she must be mental
A	why? Because I don't think they're having much sex
B	no
A	I think they've only had sex about once since the second or third break up whatever it is
B	yeah whatever
A	well it's value
B	mm
A	or he makes stuff up I don't know
B	yeah
A	what the fuck? I mean but he likes the drama
B	yeah
A	for him to have saying he's fallen deeply in love with her in a matter of moments
B	mm
A	and believing this shit though
B	it's the it's not just the believing it's the way he delivers the information
A	mm
B	like so we're both sat here and he said you know the thing I told you
A	so for like ten minutes I'm like well I know what you're talking about
B	yeah
A	I'll pretend that I'm not but it's rude
B	and I'm thinking
A	mm
B	one it's rude cos there's someone else here
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? It's just that that drip feeding of building up the suspense like it's a play like it's not
A	yeah
B	if you were really emotionally invested in it
A	mm
B	you would if he was really really truly emotionally invested in this he would have come and said I'm actually really gutted you know how you I suppose you both have got the the kind of end of the stick now that you know we thought she was pregnant
A	mm
B	and you know she's lost the baby
B	you would  you would  be so
A	if you actually was gutted yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	that's really weird
B	do you know what I mean? Just the
A	mm
B	the whole thing's very strange
A	he likes the drama
B	she's nuts
A	I mean it obviously she's compensating for some horrible grizzly incidence that's happened in her past
B	no
A	and that's massively selfish
B	yeah
A	erm particularly when you're clearly mental
B	in her so in her little world apparently
A	mm
B	just just after she's had her period
A	yeah
B	how?
A	in two weeks how would you know?
B	how?
A	how would you know? Because it at which I mean I'm not I'm a bit vague on the specifics myself but it just you can't know that quickly
B	no you can't
A	mm
B	there's nothing for it to cling onto
A	it wouldn't stick yeah
B	it's not possible
A	it's very strange
B	yeah
A	because basically because she wants to be
B	yeah
A	and now she's built up this little little fantasy
B	and I want to ask him
A	well er I mean I could ask him because it's all new to me
B	yes yes yes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I'm happier with them
A	mm
B	living the lie than I am just being me
A	that's wrong isn't it
B	where's the sense in that?
A	well there's none
B	yeah
A	true fact we haven't got very far with this plan for dinner
B	ah ha ha
A	and that
B	that's not him?
A	I know that would have been really weird
D	it's annoying I get loads everyday
A	I know
D	I turn mine because of job interviews and things like that and I just get a load of shit every day
A	oh yeah
D	no not yet
B	how did it go?
D	very well actually
B	yeah?
D	yeah
A	that's what you want
B	yeah
D	er
B	I'd give them till Monday and give them a ring
D	I was gonna give them a ring Sunday
B	they might the person that you who interviewed you might not be there on the weekend
D	well that's just a risk I'm gonna have to take innit
B	yeah do it
D	yeah
A	shows you're keen
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	there's no that's you you're always better off being keen cos a lot of the times in hotels the staff the shift changes are so frequent that
D	yeah
A	mm
B	that you're so easily forgotten about
A	mm
D	yep
D	yeah
B	hmm mm mm mm mm
D	mm
B	ah
A	get it down you
B	were they on offer?
D	three quid
A	were they?
B	that's good
D	three quid for four
B	oh I think I might need I I think we might need some bud
A	I think we might need to go cos I'm flipping hungry
B	okay
D	we've got Guinness in there
B	that's for cake
A	yeah
D	ah
A	in some some some sort of hunter gatherer
B	ah
D	yeah
A	way
D	I think my Sunday night's or Sunday lunch with mother has gone to pot as well
A	oh no but it was all looking so good
D	yeah
A	ah bless her
D	yeah
A	well that'll still be as nice though
D	yeah I'm gonna get her a big bunch of flowers and that
A	mm
D	she phoned me earlier and she sounds awful
A	oh bless her
D	really awful
A	well she'll just like having everyone around
D	well plus money is tight as well this week
A	mm
D	very tight
A	were you working today?
D	yeah
A	mm
D	I say a short day
B	shit
D	started at six
A	oh yeah you did have an early start today actually yeah
D	yeah and then erm I finished at Watford by eleven
A	yeah
D	which was nice
B	I apologise for nakedness but you seriously have to see my penis
A	in the small
B	yeah
D	oh my good God
B	innit? Look at it in the light
D	that's
A	it's massive
D	you can tell that's fluid though
A	oh man
D	that's naughty
A	you can't wait till Tuesday
B	that's serious
D	that needs some
A	like before it was like a little willy
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	I I think personally you'd be better just waiting up A and E and they'll just drain it out there and then
B	you really think?
D	yeah
A	well what's the least busy time at A and E? Now probably
D	yeah before the mad rush
A	before everyone gets pissed and starts fights
D	and do it before you have any more drink
B	yeah
D	well if you need the company I'll go with you
B	can you imagine how long I'm gonna be there for
A	maybe you could round and they could tell you how long it'll be
B	mm
D	just just just say this needs to get drained out and I've been told I've gotta wait till Tuesday but it keeps growing and it's not good
A	can you not go to CamDoc's for that sort of thing?
D	no they're they're not allowed to touch you
A	they're not allowed to touch you?
D	no they're not allowed to do stitches or nothing
A	what's the point of them? Can they write prescriptions?
D	mm mm
A	okay
B	penis
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's not just me?
A	no no no it's definitely bigger
D	I
A	as it were
D	I'd get it drained out personally
A	well it's just uncomfortable for you isn't it? You know
B	yeah
A	it's probably bigger because
B	ah
A	can you call A and E? And find out how long the waiting time is?
B	I don't know
D	when did you? Have you phoned CamDoc at all? For advice
B	no
D	just your doctor
B	but he's he's saying that this will eventually clear itself
A	even though it's getting worse?
B	yeah
A	that's what he said yeah
D	and he
