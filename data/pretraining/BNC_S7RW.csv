A	that's why well maybe four is a bit exaggerating like three
B	mm
A	door to door
B	uhu

B	yeah yeah cos the Americans love Hawaii
A	yeah
B	they're crazy about it
A	yeah yeah well it's very Japanised very very
B	mm
A	yeah
B	maybe different islands have got different erm
A	yeah that's true I think they are just going to the main
B	appeal to different
A	yeah
B	nationalities
A	yeah possibly
B	the American love Maui they always go to Maui
A	okay
B	mm
A	I don't know which er which island they're going to but anyway they'll they'll have a great time

A	yeah
B	I know I saw it on the news I'd just switched on the news before I went to bed on a Friday and I was up
A	yeah me too I was just
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	watching it yeah I was er really wide awake then
A	yeah
B	you know it was kind of so horrible and it was frightening
A	I mean
B	it's frightening absolutely frightening
A	yes and so I asked
B	what here?
A	here even here I feel like I saw that erm
B	what you
A	Salah Salah
B	yeah
A	I felt like a saw him on the tube
B	mm
A	anyway so psalm ninety-one says it it you know he's god's word is the truth
B	because of the Paris thing?
A	no just mm you know just in general
B	mm
A	there ah
B	mm
A	I'm really hungry
B	you should eat something
A	I try that Indian takeaway for the first time
B	which one?
A	here the one on
B	oh the
A	yes
B	is that the good one? because there were two that were recommended on there were two on here has one closed?
A	probably one closed because
B	I think maybe it's now the fish place that
A	oh yeah
B	maybe
A	yeah that fish place
B	there was another one and I never knew which one was good because someone had recommended one and I couldn't remember
A	okay
B	so it is good?
A	it's really it was really good
B	really?
A	mm and I wouldn't I think once six every six months might be enough for me
B	yeah and like swimming in like
A	yeah
B	ghee
A	mm it's it's quite salty
B	okay
A	I can just taste all sorts of flavours in in curries and and naan and rice and poppadum you know with the whole set
B	mm
A	it's really filling
B	yeah it's very high fat I do love it I had one a few weeks ago
A	yeah
B	and they erm in that
A	oh
B	kind of off
A	yeah yeah
B	very much
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	they're they're kind of a little bit
A	is it still the
B	no they're not actually they're they do everything
A	oh you mean on
B	the
A	famous Indian fish restaurant on
B	oh
B	no no I went
A	just
B	somewhere kind of off erm
A	but I have been I have been to a few
B	yeah
A	you know
B	I do I do like curries but erm er always a bit conscious of erm er
A	mm and all the other things
B	you know sometimes they're really oily
A	mm
B	well it's it's not oil but it's ghee
A	yeah
B	butter
A	butter mm
B	but they are good oh well that's good good to if I ever feel like having a take out Indian then erm
A	yeah the
B	the
A	I had
B	mm
A	okra in tomato curry
B	yeah
A	and prawns
B	yeah
A	both of them
B	yummy
A	were just really good
B	really?
A	and then had er
B	okay
A	plus er ten percent off for picking up
B	that's good
B	that's good
A	you know collection in person
B	okay
A	oh
B	but I haven't cooked for ages then like when I was away I cooked on my last night I'm I just made some tagliatelle with like chilli prawns which are really like and er it's just the easiest thing to make and it's just so delicious
A	what is this?
B	it's just basically it's just tagliatelle and I just sautéed the prawns in garlic and chilli chopped
A	mm
B	with chilli that's it and er
B	just literally for like three minutes in a little bit of olive oil and then just put salt and pepper and a bit of parmesan and it was really good there was big tiger prawns and that was really yummy but I haven't cooked for ages
A	where did you get the tiger prawns from? frozen?
B	just M and S or Waitrose or somewhere
A	yeah I need to
B	I wonder why they were sticking
A	I don't know my lasagne sheets from Waitrose are not very good quality ones
B	yeah maybe you should get the
A	mm erm
B	did you put too many in the pan?
A	well you need to though you need a sort of six sheets and they all have to go into the thing the pan
B	you got big big enough pan?
A	maybe I don't have a big enough pan
B	maybe you need to do it in batches so you do some and you put them out and do some and put them out
A	oh no
B	that might be a better way of doing it
A	anyway yeah I need to figure out how to
B	my mum used to do it all the time
A	how did she do it?
B	she just put them in boiling water and then put them out but I think she did it in batches I think you have to if you're doing quite a lot
A	yeah
B	but er it can't be that complicated I mean there's no reason
A	no it can't be
B	why they should stick together unless you've got too many in maybe the water's not hot enough or something or
A	I don't know there must be
B	I mean are you not rinsing
A	a way
B	them in
A	rinsing? do you rinse pasta?
B	some
A	no
B	I dunno
A	that's the the only problem I have
B	well just google it
A	yeah I should do shouldn't I?
B	yeah cos I'm sure you'd find about a million kind of similar it's it's amazing now I've just realise that nobody's had an original thought ever because you can just put anything in there and the chances are someone's had the same problem
B	it's true
A	that's how I actually you know verified the originality of my research like
B	what googling it?
A	yeah I put
A	after printing okay the digital printing
B	no
A	just my work
B	yeah
B	well maybe you are the only one
A	yeah it's not that amazing I mean you know it's not that innovative well anyway
B	yeah maybe someone's done it in some corner of the world in some
A	oh yeah
B	language that you don't understand you know
B	oh I see
A	but those ones are working in my field so they kind of told me in person you know
B	yeah
A	oh
B	you are
B	digital
B	erm it's been fine actually
A	oh yes?
B	yeah I had two my first one
A	yeah
B	and er this
A	oh okay
B	and I was a bit like oh and then but he seemed fine and
A	yeah
B	and then his friend turned up
A	oh yes?
B	rather than him like he was
A	oh yeah?
B	you know cos I have to hand over the keys
A	yeah oh right
B	and so kind of a woman in her forties so I was kind of reassured by that
A	oh good
B	and I came back and the flat was perfect
A	yeah
B	the only thing was they'd used a lot of towels for some strange reason and they'd left behind a lot of erm
A	oh yeah?
B	like the you know the big ones?
A	yeah
B	and there were like twelve of those and they'd
A	yeah
B	they were there for two nights
A	wow
B	so twelve of those and some tonic water so she must have had some vodka or gin or something
A	they must have had a party
B	well this is what I think and then when I opened the recycling bin I saw an airbed erm box
A	oh
B	which if they'd got smuggled somebody and which would explain the towels
A	yeah
B	but if they'd smuggled someone in that's naughty because they have to pay extra
A	yeah they must have been that
B	I think so
A	yeah
B	and then the woman I had last weekend I had well she came on Thursday actually
A	okay
B	so she was fine and I kind of
A	yeah
B	went home yesterday and it's kind of it's quite funny going back into your home because it's like people have got different patterns of
A	yeah
B	kind of behaviour
A	mm
B	so yeah whereas the the other guy
A	mm
B	absolutely immaculate she'd left like crumbs on the table kind of like big fingerprints all over the stuff like the stove was dirty and erm
A	yeah and do you actually make money?
B	I have made money yeah otherwise
A	yeah you yeah okay
B	I wouldn't do it yeah
A	no I
B	take my poor little cat
B	to
A	no I was I
B	yeah no no
A	I mean you do? you do?
B	I mean it's well it's er it's been a kind of life saver for me
A	oh yes? oh okay I just wondered
B	yeah
A	I just wondered yeah
B	well it's it cost me quite a lot to go to
A	do you?
A	ah
B	but it's been fine I've got the journey down to about an hour and a quarter
A	yeah oh right
B	cos where my friend lives so I go to
A	mm
B	in the cab and then I go from
A	mm
B	which erm is about anything between twenty-three and thirty-five minutes
A	that's nice yeah
B	and then his flat is like literally two minutes walk from the station
A	oh okay and
B	it's
A	you can just have the spare room?
B	well I mean he yeah
A	mm
B	he was away in Brazil that was it
A	mm
B	and then his parents are quite elderly and they live
A	mm
B	about five miles away so he spends the weekend with his parents
A	oh I see
B	his mother's got cancer
A	oh
B	or
A	yeah
B	and and he's got a spare room which is his office that he works from
A	oh right
B	so I mean he's kind of said that I can kind of like basically he's there until the end of December and then
A	mm
B	he's gonna go and live in Lisbon
A	oh right
B	so in theory although around Christmas obviously I won't go
A	oh you can come here
B	well aren't you gonna be here?
A	yeah but you know my brother's been sleeping on that
B	oh
A	I'm joking
B	just
A	yeah don't worry
B	well you know I'm kind of getting less er and less erm
A	yeah
B	and anyway which has got a lot better since I complained to the freeholder
A	yeah
B	but it's still they've been waking up in the night still like
A	yeah
B	twice a week you know
A	oh
B	so I was really tired and when I went to this place it was really quiet and
A	yeah
B	I slept through the night
A	mm
B	you know and it's really quiet it's like a new build so it's all
A	mm
B	hermetically sealed like it's really
A	mm
B	super quiet
A	mm
B	and warm and I mean it's just so calm
A	oh
B	it's just so calm
A	oh
B	slept all the way through the night and the cat was like just
B	the cat was super happy she just
B	I took her little bed and she was like in her bed
B	putting
A	well that's nice that's nice
B	so it was actually really nice
A	it's worked out yeah
B	yeah so it's really nice
A	it's amazing that the cat you know
B	I I I don't I think she's a bit stressed out by it actually cos when when I got home yesterday she went and sat in her litter tray which is a classic sign of stress apparently
B	but she
A	oh
B	seems okay I put her on the train and
A	oh
B	and in her little
A	yeah
B	and you know she seems find
A	oh okay
B	but I think maybe it's a bit much for her
A	mm would you mind if I boil a a noodle?
B	oh no go for it
A	quickly
B	go for it
B	do you want me to kill them?
A	er no not really
B	do you want me to throw them out the window?
A	well well I don't know not exactly the window
B	are they really big? are they the big ones or the little ones?
A	well they these are the famous er er false widow spiders
B	oh you're joking?
A	I'm not joking
B	but they're really dangerous
A	well that's why I'm telling you or
B	oh
A	in
B	oh
A	a little one
B	oh that one
A	that's a little one
B	mm
A	and there's a big one over there in the corner
B	oh I'll just leave it
A	yeah
B	I'd leave it I mean I I can quite happily catch them and throw them out if you want
A	yeah
B	I don't mind I don't I don't like them myself to be honest they make me a bit
A	but er yeah
B	I don't like the thought of them crawling over me at night
A	yeah they won't move that's that's why I haven't caught them they've been there for a long long time mm
B	so my Airbnb thing the
A	yeah
B	something er something quite funny is that I got a request from er this woman for
A	what?
B	mm
A	oh
B	and I was like oh I don't know if my sofa cos I've got this new sofa and I don't know if it's gonna survive a five-year-old which
A	yeah
B	you know
A	that's fair enough
B	and fair enough and then she said oh by the way I live opposite you
A	what?
B	she said we live at number seventy-one
A	on my god
B	and then how freaky is that? so now I've and I haven't heard from her since actually
A	well that's a very strange contact
B	isn't it weird?
A	yeah
B	and she said no we're between flats and erm we need somewhere to stay and then she came back to me and said actually we need it for thirteen days and I was like oh I don't know I I've
A	thirteen?

B	it's okay it's okay yeah I don't know it's been a bit kind of erm
A	mm
B	it's kind of cheap there you know if I wanted to buy a little house there it's very cheap and it's in a
A	oh it's
B	I'm getting poorer now
A	oh yeah but you know
B	yeah in the middle of nowhere
A	in a place like that
B	it's okay I mean I I don't know I I I need to I need to do a bit more exploring but anyway if things you know it was kind of like

B	yeah cos I've been feeling like that for a year
B	my stress levels are just they've been so high they've been like up here
A	me too
B	just a nightmare and then I sorted out a few bits and pieces and
A	yeah that's so well done
B	I know but
A	that's so great but you were I mean
B	I could do with more I mean I could do with now I'm into the kind of the making the sacrifice and you know cos when I first thought about it I was like
A	mm
B	wow this is really like a massive disruption
A	yeah
B	and really it quite quite upset me
A	mm
B	and now I've done it I'm I'm kind of like a bit more kind of open and flexible which I have to be in my position I can't I can't not be flexible
A	well you seem to enjoy it in a way
B	well you know I guess
B	I guess I mean I guess I was lucky because you know I was lucky my friend is not really around and he's a he's a really old friend of mine I mean he's
A	mm
B	from my university friend
A	yeah
B	and erm he's
A	ah
B	he's just been kind of like you know just a source of good practical kind of practical assistance and just said oh you know I mean he he planned it the whole Airbnb thing in my head
A	oh that's so good I mean you know yeah your friends you know
B	ah I just really needed that kind of you know and you've been so sweet as well to offer your flat and it's just things like that you know
A	oh no fine
B	just kind of really helpful but anyway but erm
A	erm
B	oh no
A	bed mm
B	it's fine it's just my little my little cat you know
A	mm
B	it's just my little cat so but erm
A	mm
B	but yeah my stress levels like and when I first went there and I got in the door with the cat the first time like I got a key that we cut that doesn't work properly in the door
A	oh yeah oh typical yeah
B	and it took me ages to get in and I was like panicking cos I couldn't get either of the locks open cos it's
B	the bloody key wouldn't work
A	oh yeah
B	and I got in and I was so relieved and he had like ten this is what I had a fag cos he had like ten Marlboro Lights and I was just like went out on the balcony I was like so
B	stressed oh
B	so I literally had so much like adrenalin running through my body
A	yeah
B	I do get very stressed
A	oh
B	but now my stress levels have kind of come down cos now I've kind of faced the worst situation
B	you know the worst
A	I know I know the I realise
B	do you know what I mean?
A	I know yeah yeah
B	I now I know that you know I can might have to sell my flat I might have to and I'm I'm kind of fine with it now and just kind of
A	you seem calm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	yeah I feel I feel better I mean obviously it's a bit kind of desperate it's
A	mm
B	kind of it's just desperate
A	you're not the only one
B	well
A	but
B	I I don't I yeah I
A	that is so true
B	problems is pretty much one of the worst things that can you know happen
A	mm
B	but anyway but I've kind of
A	yeah but yeah no I agree
B	faced the fear
A	yeah I think you in your case it's the yeah the the changes you're facing are so big
B	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	anyway whatever so erm
A	mm
B	but anyway but I kind of feel a I feel a bit better at the moment I've just kind of like I've come down from the really high stress place and I I just feel a bit like resigned now
A	yeah you can watch your couple of friends on Netflix it can't be too bad
B	oh I've had a terrible time
A	oh
B	but anyway
A	but I do know I mean you know
A	I mean I've been you know living like you you know a zombie
B	yeah I've heard that yeah
A	mm
B	just working and working
A	I just it was never ending never ending oh my gosh
B	oh yeah
A	I never really I was you know un-stressed to write and edit and all of these things
A	I missed a complete autumn
B	yeah that's the worst time to wake up
A	I know
B	having loads of
A	I know
B	free time in the winter
A	oh
B	it's so grim already
A	yeah
B	I can't bear it you know I was swimming in the pond up until last week I was still in there
A	yes I just have two or three recollections of that and that's it my summer was gone mm
B	I don't know what I've done with my year I've had so much
B	I've got the opposite problem I've had so much time and and like so little of it has been productive
A	mm
B	I'm really not looking forward to the winter
A	ah
B	with no travel and
A	I know
B	god
A	but I don't know
A	quite happy not to travel
B	really? I love it
A	I never used to
B	but that's only cos of your PhD you won't be you should relax now a little bit if you can
B	get into
A	yeah I should
B	a job
A	yeah I should do
B	you might feel better when you come back from Japan and like sometimes it's good to have like a physical
A	the yeah
B	displacement you know
B	mm
A	so it's a lot of catching up to do
B	are you not in contact with them a lot on the phone?
A	no
B	but your parents?
A	no I don't really
B	really?
A	no
B	you don't ring them?
A	mm
B	why not?
A	I never did
B	how strange
A	I never did
B	and they don't ring you?
A	not necessarily
B	that's interesting
A	but I see them when I go home
B	oh okay
A	I mean of course you know we talk occasionally about things very rare maybe you know every half a year three months
B	wow that's amazing
A	I don't talk to my father these days because you know he's he he works in Ireland and usually I don't just you know I usually talk call my mother and then talk to my father
B	really?
A	mm
B	okay
A	mm and I think it's an ageing thing
B	mm
B	mm
A	so there is kind of you know indirect
B	mm
A	contact with the rest of my family
B	mm
A	yeah I'm terrible I'm terrible in keeping in touch that's the thing I'm terrible
B	mm
A	I'm really not very good with long distant kind of erm relationships
B	mm I'm amazed you don't use Skype and all that stuff that is around now that makes it so easy
A	no it's we no
B	video calls
A	no
B	and stuff
A	it doesn't make it easy because you know my father doesn't use Skype my mother uses Skype or we er a little bit er
B	mm
A	not that technically savvy so we just end up talking on the phone
B	mm
A	which is fine somehow because landline's cheap now these days to call landlines
B	oh is it?
A	mm oh but
B	I mean yeah I guess so if there's a pattern but you know well I mean it's fine if they don't mind
A	but I do feel a bit awkward you know
B	mm
A	and there's not much we can you know I mean I will probably have a couple of days with my mother cos he has to go back to this Ireland and I will probably
B	I'm sure it will be nice to go
A	it will be nice to go but I'm just
B	you're probably just tired
A	just think of the journey to Heathrow
B	okay
A	I usually fly with Finnair
B	really?
A	mm somehow quite like it
B	how long is the flight?
A	mm
B	oh my
A	no fifteen
B	oh fifteen
A	fifteen yeah sorry
B	so is it so do you stop at all anywhere?
A	yeah Helsinki
B	is that it? and then it's one leg
A	yeah
B	from Helsinki
A	yeah
B	all the way
A	to all the way to Kansai not Tokyo to Kansai
B	and that's what? nine hours?
A	I don't know maybe mm something like that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	uhu mm I love plane travel but
A	it's I suppose so
B	maybe not so much at the moment but
A	I mean my brother came back for two days you know this weekend he arrived
B	mm
A	arrived at six o'clock in the or seven o'clock in the morning on Friday attended this ceremony something to do with with Japanese society of
B	mm
A	and then stayed here on Friday and Saturday and then flew back to Japan again
B	you're joking
A	no and I said are you crazy?
A	he said no I wanted to attend this ceremony it's really important for the future
B	oh right
A	of Japanese medical system so I mean it's
B	oh well
A	I was like oh
B	but er
A	and then left again
B	oh my god
A	but I would be like that a bit
B	mm
A	it'll be just like that I'll be home sleeping most of the time
B	well it's good you can regress to being a teenager
A	I always do when I go home
B	everybody does
A	where's my washing?
B	mm
A	have you got my laundry?
A	erm
B	it's good timing and you'll then you'll have a bit of a blast of kind of Japanese culture which will be interesting and a beautiful wedding which will be lovely and emotional and then like you know then you'll come back for Christmas
A	yeah I'm glad I'm coming back and doing this science museum thing on the fifteenth but I could have stayed for longer if I'd known
B	mm
A	that my
B	yeah yeah
B	cos you thought it was December?
A	mm I thought it was gonna be around the fifteenth
B	how annoying
A	so I'm quite annoyed
B	can you not change it? or now you've got your
A	oh no it's all no I can't
B	how annoying
A	yeah but at the same time it's a bit more relaxing in a way cos I can just relaxing as in you know like in my usual kind of you know super way but I have plenty of time to go over my thesis
B	oh okay
A	and research for my application and positions I can't do that at home
B	mm
A	and my mother you know a student doing the homework so
B	mm
B	oh
A	it probably won't be changed very much where I live
B	what's that sorry?
A	I don't think much has changed in my area
B	where?
A	yeah
B	where your mum is?
A	yeah
B	when did you when were you there last? last year?
A	no I was there about two years ago
B	two years ago
A	very briefly cos that time we you know we it was the new year so we all spent time in er our father's place in
B	yeah
A	in Ireland where he works
B	yeah
A	and and that was bizarre because just so cold
B	oh no
A	er oh
B	oh well listen we should celebrate the end of your
A	yeah
B	we should celebrate the putting to bed of the thesis the dawn of a new era
A	are you still recording?
B	I think so
A	oh good
B	I think so
A	fantastic
B	I haven't sent anything in yet they were emailed me about it and I said I was gonna do it and then I and then I didn't I started preparing it all
A	oh yes?
B	and then I got sidetracked by some other pointless activity of like applying applying for some pointless job which obviously I would never get
B	and it's
A	you'll get somewhere
B	I don't think so I failed another thing you know I failed a erm I found another thing and I applied for it
A	oh yes?
B	yeah it was like another
A	oh
B	and I applied for it and I got past the first test and then
A	mm
B	they were like we want you to do another test so the second test was two hours long and I did the second test and I waited to hear and then they said you failed it
A	wow
B	and erm they said you had too many errors and erm
A	that sounds like a really hard task
B	it was quite a lot to do in er like time was short so on the feedback to the writers obviously I had I just picked like a couple of points each I was like oh well you know cos obviously like I'm gonna run out of time right so I'm not gonna this is not the exercise the
A	oh my god
B	what world do we live in? you know what world do we live in? you know when you're giving feedback to someone like you're straight and to the point you're not like oh oh oh ah oh oh oh
A	yeah
B	oh oh
B	it was so ridiculous but anyway they just said oh well so you failed that but we'd erm we'd be delighted if you'd join our network of writers
A	wow well that's something
B	not really because I because it's gonna pay even worse than the editors which was quite bad but better than the last one erm it'll it'll pay really really badly and erm so then of course I I went to the website to kind of launch this
A	I mean
B	well what am I gonna do?
A	you know
B	no I'm I've I've applied for all sorts of stuff
A	mm
B	and it's you know why are we
A	mm oh I see
B	it's it's kind of you know it's quite difficult to get work that is not something you've done before
A	yeah of course yeah
B	cos that's what people recruit for
A	yeah
B	so even if it's like a low job I have a harder time with the low jobs
A	mm
B	because I you just look at my CV and like you've gotta be joking so it's a bit of a problem
A	yeah okay
B	kind of finding something that is just like a you know just something to do which will pay some kind of you know basic money but I don't know what you're gonna be looking for but it's it's really difficult you know unless you go and work in a shop which I'm not gonna do sorry not because I feel I'm above it but I'm just like you know so it's really hard it's just really difficult
A	mm
B	it's just very difficult to find I've applied for
A	what about this
B	yeah I I am gonna do that but
A	mm
B	the exams aren't till I've got to I need to redo my CV so I need to completely rework it
A	oh
B	in a new way and I wanted to find like a charity editing thing like
A	mm
B	to do as a project
A	mm
B	so so I wanted to kind of be engaged on that
A	mm mm
B	when I was doing my application
A	mm mm
B	cos I thought it would give me like
A	yeah
B	some er additional kind of necessary
A	yeah experience
B	gravitas
A	gravitas
B	you know cos I'm coming from a consumer background
A	yeah
B	recently anyway so and I haven't kind of like and I asked somebody about it who's running like a charity project but I haven't heard back from him and I don't think he wants to share any of it with me so I kind of need to find something so that in itself is quite difficult because or obviously a lot of the kind of global organisations employ people
A	mm
B	or they have interns or they er so volunteering and something like that is quite I haven't found anything yet I need to keep looking I was looking today actually
A	mm
B	so I've had an issue with that so I really wanted to apply for that before Christmas
A	mm
B	but then the exams aren't until July
A	yeah
B	so even if I passed the written exam in July there's then an aural
A	mm
B	so then if I passed all of those then I'd be eligible to apply for stuff from September
A	oh my
B	yeah so I've got to kind of get from here to there
A	yeah I know I have the same
B	so nine months ten months
A	yeah
B	and then I might not even and even if I fail it's not a disaster it just means that I lose another year so anyway it's quite difficult you know it's quite difficult
A	especially if you are just you know er having to you know live the moment I mean
B	it's just a nightmare
B	it's just I dunno
A	mm
B	everything everything falls through
A	mm
B	it's been the theme of the year it's just been the theme like everything has fallen through
A	you will come out of it very strong
B	I don't know if I will
A	you will come out
B	I think
A	you will
B	I'll come out of it a broken woman
A	no er you know when I saw
B	really?
A	you will find out you know if you if you catch up with
B	but what hell?
A	you know
A	she had to give birth you know when
B	but he turned up for the birth didn't he?
A	in a in a extremely awkward kind of you know er it er
B	I dunno I'm looking forward to kind of closing the door on twenty fifteen
B	it's been like annus horribulis it really has
A	oh
B	it has like it's been a really bad year but anyway
A	you will survive
B	yeah it's just that kind of like really basic component of kind of making a living which is alluding me at the moment
A	yes
B	it's kind of quite worrying
A	oh but I think I mean I'm so you know the you're cos you're keeping at it you just you're doing so well
B	I didn't today I just couldn't do anything I'm so demoralised I just you know
A	yeah
B	I was just really demoralised that
A	but I have those days when I was writing the thesis you know for you know for
B	mm
A	but eventually the deadline comes you know you've got to do it you know
B	that's true
A	and just that just makes it you know just that's how we survive
B	mm
A	probably yeah
B	mm because I think that's how she survived yeah and god cos she yeah I think she she was looking after some
