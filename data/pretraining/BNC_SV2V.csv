B	just like my geography of the North is everything is together up from er here as we discussed
A	yeah
A	yep
B	oh God
A	so
A	all of it
B	I think unless you go to these places you have no er I mean even I've been to

A	mm
B	actually if you go there you know er you know where you are

A	mm
B	between
A	mm
B	something went wrong
A	yeah
B	I suppose that's that is the danger
A	no
B	not a clue
A	it's the same way as if you never walk through
B	mm
A	no idea where anything is
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	and it really helps with joining the dots
A	mm
B	till I
A	oh
B	through and through anyway
A	mm
B	then he'd put me on the train from er
A	I can't remember where I've walked to now
B	mm
A	but I
B	that's the freezer I think
A	yep
B	Don't  know
A	I think he wants to talk
B	I think it wants to take off
B	I think there might be alien life forms living in there
A	ever
B	Cos you can barely get anything in it
A	that's really concerning ain't it
B	well so long as um we no no one's here
A	yes

B	from the garage

A	that can't be right
B	huh
A	Lamb time

A	oh

B	mm
A	was telling me that she you know they were looking at the
B	yeah
A	um and they said oh well the weather forecast says it's gonna be nice

B	mm
A	in America it's never wrong
B	tut
A	we're just shit apparently
B	well
A	they get it right all the time
B	I just I don't think their systems can be that different
A	compared to theirs
B	compared to theirs
A	mm
B	unpredictable
A	I think we might have used to have them
B	certainly the summer is always a bit shit isn't it
A	mm
B	June July August
A	yeah
B	Cos July and August are shit usually
A	sunshine
B	mm
A	oh no

A	yes
B	I see  I see  I'm on the page
A	er
B	where are the lambs? Bring them to me
A	what time is baa lamb time tomorrow?
B	yeah
A	and that if he hasn't sorted it let's hope he just use the initiative to sort it out to please me
B	yeah
A	no
B	not with that one
A	hm
B	mm
A	all the excitement
B	huh
A	no
B	really? You surprise me
A	yes
A	um
B	mm
A	something something
B	mm
A	and then yes that er you know it would be nice to catch up some time
B	as we're not in Germany
B	motherfucker
A	as it er
A	and then he'd be like what? I'm in
B	so not Germany? That's interesting
A	or if you're not in Germany I don't wanna know
B	mm
A	it's not the free holiday
B	yeah
A	it's just not
B	it's a goodbye from me and a goodbye from him
A	mm
B	mm
A	uh
B	nice these were
B	Num num
A	dolly Mixtures? Yeah
B	yeah
A	it's like the sugar
B	uh
A	yeah
B	period of genius
A	yeah
B	have you heard from
A	mm mm
B	no?
A	heard from his mum
B	from his mum
A	to just see how I was doing and if I'd got a date for my fit medical
B	mm
A	Brown one?
B	no
B	Green I think
A	oh er oh is it the jelly?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's not going back in
B	I think it was lime or or the closest thing that artificial flavourings can make lime
B	feel like something's died in my mouth
A	I um
B	I'll come back to you
A	haven't heard from that crazy guy yet
B	oh yeah sorry
A	wine in the freezer?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well I put it in the fridge
A	the one that um
A	yeah
B	the one in Afghanistan?
A	the one from the hotel that never shuts the fuck up
B	oh yeah
A	I was talking to er er
B	mm
A	and she was like
B	saying what a
A	um
B	men talking about themselves?
A	so I told her about the book of course
B	mm
A	and um that now we've got wizards
B	oh
A	all of the above
B	um
A	yeah
B	or some poor other girl that you've been following
A	yeah
B	and luckily he does work in the other building so I don't ever have to see him
A	what did the girls say?
B	tut
A	so basically
B	they've got chatting to him
A	they knew him a little bit
B	yeah
A	and er and thought what the hell
A	the genius came into play
B	because with
A	they'll only tell you the truth
B	they really understand
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you're your own person and you can make decisions for yourself
A	yeah
B	it makes me question the friendship
A	yeah
B	and so I do
A	mm
B	so we all proceeded to get absolutely smashed
A	yep
B	and er lots and lots of booze later we're in
A	yep
B	some time in the morning
A	that's the place that stays open till like
B	all night
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	leaves
B	which could be like Monday morning
A	yep
B	um
A	yeah
B	conversation
A	yeah
B	nothing offered
A	like encouraging this
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but a bit of
A	yeah
B	I know you're fucked
A	mm
B	I did think
A	no
B	um this is a bit weird
A	yep
A	I think that's a bit weird
B	so I like the girl but I have always had my reservations
A	yep
B	and I thought even though I like them I've lived with lived as one of three girls before and the two girls fell out and I was piggy in the middle
A	mm
B	they're very very close
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and you go home with them that could get really too much
B	tut
A	I did it with
B	mm
A	and there was only sometimes there was just the two of us
B	yeah
A	and I had to tell her off and stuff
B	yeah
A	so that was quite stretched sometimes
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	we both had made such a point to keep it so professional
B	mm
A	there's no way you could've pulled that string
B	mm
A	Cos our desks were joined onto his
B	mm
A	Cos we had a separate office to everyone else
B	oh okay
A	and so it was blatant lies
B	mm
A	and then we were living in
B	mm
B	mm
A	Cos we were slimming
B	mm
A	so it was really the most stressful
B	mm
A	possible situation imaginable
B	mm
A	and we were with each other twenty-four seven
B	yeah
A	and I said to
B	mm
A	really
B	mm
A	and not getting pissed off
B	mm
A	but then I think if you work with someone that you don't really know
B	mm
A	I was we were still worried
B	mm
A	I think if there's um any doubt don't do it
B	well absolutely
A	oh right
B	um
A	mm
B	so it's very separate
A	yeah
B	generally speaking
A	they're helpers
B	they're the helpers
A	mm
B	because they have enough common interests in their their industry in terms of their work and what they can talk about
A	mm
B	I mean I I would hope that they don't actually talk about work
A	yeah
B	Cos you'd be at work all day and then you'd be coming home and talk about work
A	work
B	that'd be
A	yeah
B	my worry
A	it'll just take over
B	do
A	no not not at all
B	mm
A	or an event within that environment
B	mm
A	in which case it doesn't really matter that it's at work cos it could be  it could be  anywhere
B	could be a friendship
A	it doesn't matter
B	yeah
A	Cos it's the event that's the important part of the conversation or
B	mm
A	mm
B	I don't need to take it home with me
A	that's good
B	it's quite quite encouraging
A	mm
B	but it's I think also it's just very I dunno
B	and obviously you've got clients and suppliers but it's not really the same
A	mm
B	and I just think everyone else will find it boring
A	mm
B	I dunno if
A	nobody else would like my job
B	mm
A	young girls
B	young girls
A	I think would really love it
B	Cos er planning weddings
A	yeah
B	mm
A	conferences
B	mm
A	I think some if
B	mm
A	and she seemed quite nice
B	aw
A	he's here
B	amazing
A	he's having his own night
B	where is he?
A	we have free passes if we want
B	what in that pub?
A	um
B	in
B	this is the girl who a new girl who works behind the bar?
A	new girl
B	in the pub in
A	in
B	at the hotel?
A	I'm missing out vital details
B	where did the
A	Cos that's where she
B	did you mention
A	that's where she works
B	but
A	and I met her
B	last week
A	for the first time
B	or something
A	last week
B	yeah
A	sorry
B	okay
A	but apart from that
B	mm
A	I do now
B	nice
A	um
B	as well as working behind the bar?
A	mhm
B	mm
A	she does promotion a couple of days a week
B	oh
A	mm
B	really? Still?
A	mm
B	what's going on?
A	tell you in a minute
B	oh
A	er
B	mm
A	around that mark
B	yeah
A	she'd get the boring admin bit alongside it
B	mm
A	but I think she would thrive on doing that because of the end entertaining part
B	yeah
A	so I think  I think  if you're not very bright and you would go
B	mm
A	to be a receptionist say
B	mm
A	that's what your aim in life is to be a receptionist
A	then to do my job
B	it's a step above that isn't it ultimately
A	would be a step above it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think some some kind of
B	it's not a bad job for somebody who's you know who's not got er further career aspirations
A	mm
B	you know
A	or even to be a manager there I think would be quite
B	yeah
A	I think you just don't need to have much ambition
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah yeah
A	much further than that
B	yeah
A	it's a very direct route
B	mm
A	the job role basically
B	mm
A	we do the same thing
B	and line manage
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's not really but she only has to line manage
B	yeah
A	that's not really a manager job to me when there's only two of you
B	well it's it's the same for my my level above
B	production experience
B	mm
A	like the system that we use
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so he's our  champion
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah
B	you do sort of delegate it
A	mm
B	she's very aware of what each of us are working on
A	mm
B	I think she's got the right balance
A	you see
B	oh
A	she answers the phone as much as we answer the phone
B	so that's probably why she's so fucking stressed
A	mm
B	like obviously Christmas was mental
A	oh shit that was bad
B	yeah
A	and
B	I mean if they really don't have budget to get some
A	we've got two thousand covers for next year
B	Good
A	already
B	it's March
A	we
A	we got four thousand as a total last last year
B	thank God you're gonna be out of there
A	mm
B	so fine
A	I think he should have
B	yeah
A	mm
B	sick or whatever
A	I think the only reason she does it is because there's not enough staff
B	mm
A	so for the amount of work that's involved
B	right
A	chasers and admin work
B	mm
A	really what should be happening is
B	me
B	huh
A	I'm not sure about it yet hon
B	tell him to get out
A	what's
A	mm
B	it's on the coast
A	not sure
B	not sure? Or not sure he's back?
A	so not sure he's back tomorrow
A	baa lamb
B	mm
A	yeah she
B	hm?
A	oh
B	and what does
A	well one day a week she's a DM
B	mm
A	but that means she'll stay and sometimes work till midnight
B	fuck me
A	she's if she stays in the hotel
B	half five?
A	the next day
B	mm
A	yes
B	that's how much I earn
A	yeah
B	and I'm a trainee
A	can you believe it? Yeah
B	that's ridiculous
A	can you believe a manager would do that?
B	no
A	and she has to take  she has to take  decisions that are for the entire property
B	mm
A	like she's got people coming to to her for her to train them on best practice
B	mm
A	like she has to really take a massive responsibility for it
B	mm
A	I'm not talking like a manager in a team of managers perhaps
B	mm
A	with someone as her direct line
B	mm
A	nah
B	um British Gas
A	british Gas
B	british Gas
A	mm
B	sorry love
A	um
B	yeah
A	whoever whoever ends up with one that's confirmed
B	Jesus
A	yeah
B	mm
A	compared to them
B	mm
A	and I was lie hand them over
B	mm
A	like don't feel bad about handing them over
B	yeah
A	and I keep getting the weddings
A	Cos
B	fair
A	which is fine
B	mm
A	um
B	okay
A	um
B	mm
A	I don't mind at all
B	mm
A	I mean to be fair I've been fighting for other business
B	mm
A	and I've had er another wedding to arrange
A	fuck
B	are you gonna  are you gonna  be out before this woman gets married though?
A	no

B	mm
A	but she has to be seen to be doing something
B	yep
A	and I have to be seen to be doing something
B	that'd be great
A	I mean it's a big
B	Good career move for him
A	he's jumping cos he should be a supervisor before he's a manager
B	mm
A	he could be
B	wow
A	he's really competent  really competent  And he'll have his NVQ admin qualification that he's just finishing off
B	put in a good word
A	yeah

A	and you're what? Probably going out with Mikey or something stupid
B	Jesus
A	Jesus

A	with a conundrum like that I would've found a way round it straightaway
B	mm
A	no
B	mm
A	and
B	she's not far off is she
A	not far off that
B	East angular
A	mm
B	it's abroad ain't it?
A	East angular
B	East angular
B	er
A	oh yeah
B	and he's er he worked on the punts in
A	ah
B	my friend he's friends with my friend
B	not that it  not that it  exists
B	Cos it's
A	yeah
B	and her mum
A	I haven't seen her mum
B	she was on I think when they did the Celebrity Big Brother where er everyone was a racist
B	her mum went in with her then
A	I remember a
A	I remember a programme called The Salon being on
B	I don't think well I dunno if you were
A	like
B	part of it
A	like
B	it was pretty good
A	ah
B	and then
A	oo
B	and then famous people
A	was it ages ago?
B	yeah yeah
A	mhm
B	it was when I was
A	mhm
B	at uni
A	yeah
B	who ran this salon
A	I remember that
B	and they did it a couple of years running I think
B	actually what it's called
A	yep
A	you've got er
B	er
B	it's like
A	no Peter
A	not ever say
B	I say
A	do you?
B	yeah
A	I think I say
B	it's like round here the you know you've got
A	mm
B	to pick up the M11
A	yep
B	you've got the
A	mm
B	fields
A	mm
A	right
B	anyway
A	mm
B	people er people her call it
A	I probably call it
A	mm
B	Bury
A	I think it depends how you when you're brought up how you're taught things
B	yeah
A	Cos I was from
B	okay
A	but I'd say
B	oh okay
A	mm
B	well in
B	it's weird
B	bothered to pronounce
A	mhm
B	but they call it
B	any of the other  any of the other  consonants really
B	they just think
A	nah
B	I'm busy
A	no time for that now
B	I've got  I've got  better things to do I'm afraid
A	there's another thing I saw
B	Derby
A	it's Derby
B	yeah
A	why do those stupid people call it Derby?
B	as in donkey
A	yeah
B	mm
A	Don't get that
B	oh it's people trying to be posh
A	stupid Derby
B	sounded like  sounded like  idiots
A	mm
B	I suppose I dunno
A	Derby
B	or like Coventry or something
A	stupid accents
B	speaking Welsh
A	no
B	really
A	no
B	she's like ha ha ha ha they're really funny
B	particularly funny
B	they'd take that well to English people pointing and laughing
A	probs not  probs not  Um
B	mm
A	well he is English
B	right
A	but I think he moved away when he was like six or something
B	mm
A	um
A	types
B	ah
A	welsh till I die
B	fine
A	and they sent her the final reminder
B	we're gonna come break your legs
A	and she refused because
B	that's er
A	she said no fuck off
B	well that's interesting
A	yeah
B	but you  but you  can
B	because you speak
A	I am not paying it
B	fine
A	really?
B	they were horrible to them
A	why do they hate us?
B	um
B	and er they were saying that at that time I dunno whether they ever did it
A	mm
B	they want to change it so that it's Welsh first
A	mm
B	and then the English
A	yeah
B	millions of pounds
A	I've heard that before
B	it's ridiculous behaviour
A	mm
B	really?
A	mm
B	that's interesting
A	Cos the Polish population there is so high
B	mm
A	that the
B	absolutely
A	like
B	and they do all the jobs the English people won't do
A	won't do
B	mm
A	a coach used to come and collect them from their home
B	no way
A	it used to pick them up at five in the morning
B	mm
A	all through the estate
B	mm
A	five days a week
B	mm
A	but because a lot of the shops are owned by Polish
B	mm
A	is a bit like where I lived when I was at uni
B	mm
A	um
B	oh okay
A	and so they petitioned to put the road signs in Polish
B	mm
A	they they passed it
B	ff
A	out of control
B	huh
A	you shouldn't really do that
B	er well I mean in any other country they wouldn't have it would they
A	no
B	do you know what I mean?
A	they'd tell them to fuck off
B	and er huh
A	mm
B	I don't really believe that countries should stop other people from moving in
A	yeah
B	er however
A	yeah
B	we're a small island
A	yep
B	we're pretty much full to capacity right now
A	yep
B	um
A	I mean if it's a trade that we need I think that's a good way of judging it
B	mm
A	like we we brought in a load of dentists about six years ago didn't we
B	mm
A	from Poland
B	yeah
A	Cos we didn't have enough
B	absolutely
A	fine
B	well that's um so that's certainly how Australia do it isn't it
A	is it?
B	and er and they only let you in based on um a numbering er system
A	tut
B	and um if you've got a particularly
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh
B	A company
A	yeah
B	mm
A	if you get there on a work visa
B	yeah
A	and you're there for the duration of your work visa
B	yeah
A	do it
B	it's hard er I think cos er Australia if you you can only get a working visa for a year
A	oh God
B	you can be extended to two years
A	oh God
B	she had to live in the Outback
A	yeah
B	it was like that
A	oh
B	they wouldn't send the helicopter ambulance out
A	what?
B	so you really are at the mercy of whether
A	uh
B	someone can come and get you if something bad
A	mm
B	but it's a bit harsh
A	work on a farm
B	but this so yeah the going back to the point about the road signs
A	mm
B	therefore everything should be in English
A	yeah
B	er the
A	mm
B	because we're becoming the white
A	yeah
B	and I mean er
A	yeah
B	in response to that
A	choose
B	I
A	yeah
B	but certainly with the um migration of Muslims coming here
A	yeah
B	national identity
B	I don't really agree with that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and that's why they don't want them to
A	yep
B	tut
A	no er
B	religion separate to
A	I mean they have a thing where in any school any government any it's anybody employed by the government
B	mm
A	any school
B	mm
A	no anything
B	mm
A	that says your religious beliefs
B	mm
A	nothing
B	that's what they do in America isn't it
A	oh is it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	ah
B	they they're so well it's really difficult actually isn't it
A	mm
B	they're quite religious
A	no
B	because laws that are
A	huh
B	number of people on Death Row
A	it doesn't make sense to me
B	you know
A	that far away?
B	that's how far away it is
A	what?
B	massive
A	I suppose you see it on the map
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's really far
A	Jesus
B	it's like  it's like  its er its own continent essentially is probably what's
A	yeah
B	gonna happen
A	yeah
B	Cos you just can't  you just can't  create laws for all of them
A	what do you mean its own continent?
B	if you think about the USA er um and compare it to Europe
A	yeah
B	for example
A	so what's continent is America in?
B	it's North
A	ah
B	central America
A	which is er all that crap before Brazil
B	no
A	some Peru or summat
B	Peru's South
A	is it?
B	Chile's South
A	oh
B	I think that's South
A	mm
A	my geography's appalling
B	huh?
A	my geography's appalling
B	mine's pretty bad
A	yeah at least you know where things are
B	roughly
A	well you know
B	I think it is er because you look at the places that you want to go to
B	so I've looked at
A	oh
B	where those countries are
A	probably wise
B	probably not gonna be doing that
A	it's probably wise
B	any time soon
A	I wouldn't advise it
B	mm
A	I wouldn't advise that
B	the what?
A	go there
B	what's a submarium?
A	er it's like er an aquarium but you go underneath it
B	oh
A	yeah

A	yeah
B	by finding the rockets from the Apollo missions in the sea
A	tut
B	do you know like when the rockets blast off into space and they go and put so that what he wants to find is the rocket that was attached to the shuttle that went up for the Apollo 11 mission
A	why?
B	A it belongs to NASA so FYI you can't even have it if you do dredge it up
A	yeah
B	what are you doing?

B	I think he he's someone who he er philanthropic I think they call it
A	Philanthopic
B	er philanthropic
B	philanthropy
A	Philanthropic
B	well I say er
A	not philanthropic?
B	I'd I would say
A	I think
B	in the world
A	in the world
B	it's er
A	oh
B	but it's more to do with the way you put the stress on the first
A	Philanthropic
B	first vowel isn't it
A	second to last vowel
B	so it's philanthropic
A	it's the second to last one
A	oh
B	I don't know
A	I'm gonna have to google it I'm afraid
B	I think it's
A	this is how much of a geek
B	philanthropic
A	but it usually changes doesn't it
B	yeah
A	if you change the word
B	yeah
A	it does usually change
B	so
A	but yes
B	so that
A	but NASA's just gonna take it back anyway
B	yeah
A	so he didn't really think that through with his millions
B	ff
A	which he'll waste
B	it does make you think what on earth is lying at the bottom of the ocean? Like all kinds of space garbage
A	yeah
B	did you ever watch that that advert you know that was a Smirnoff advert? And they made them have like
A	the Judderman
B	huh?

A	how am I spelling this one? Is it P H? Philanthropic
B	P H I L A N T H R O P I C?
B	yeah I mean I imagine the salt's eroded er the metal
B	whether NASA know about this I don't know
A	yeah
B	his his other idea is that he's going to have a ten thousand year clock that's gonna count down to twenty er well I don't even know
A	ten thousand
B	it'd be ten
A	thirty thousand?
A	thirty thousand and eleven
A	oh twenty so it'd be

A	I
B	I think the the idea
A	right
B	with more money than sense
A	yep
B	well he's probably bright enough
A	oh
B	probably mental
A	ah
B	so he obviously
A	none of the mentalness allowed here
B	you know like when they um tut er put you in mental prison because you're not actually in charge of your own faculties
