A	I erm have pretty much decided that I'm not gonna to drive to work any more
B	any more any more
A	any more any more
B	okay
A	erm my car isn't reliable in the slightest and I'm just not enjoying it at all like
B	yeah
A	coming home like I've got plenty of energy when I get home to do stuff
B	okay if that's what you wanna do that's what you'll do
A	and the way I see it like that
B	you need if you need to take the car you can take it
A	well the way I see is that like
B	okay
A	I don't see the point of holding onto it obviously I've said I wanna take you out in it tonight to listen to it you know when you just I know it's about to cost me more money? it is about to cost me more money I was I was kind of surprised that they were even willing to offer me like six or seven hundred quid for it because it's done so many miles and it's so old and it is battered
B	it's not actually
A	I'm never gonna get that money back
B	so I just straight sell my car now
A	I mean it's just an idea I'm not saying that that's I'm not saying I'm not you're not I'm just kind of putting it out there as a suggestion that we could use my car as part exchange and actually get a little bit of money off and then whatever you make on your car you can just keep as savings for you to do whatever you want with
B	okay
A	well we could do that
B	yeah
A	if you wanted
B	well yeah
A	but that means you'd have no cash though so it would
B	yeah maybe
A	the point of it
B	yeah or maybe sell my car and then use some of that as deposit
A	yeah well what I was
B	I might see about if my parents want a new car
A	well what was
A	what I was thinking is what you might be able to do is you know that fifteen hundred pounds you've got that's kind of stashed aside at the moment?
B	and then I sell my car as soon as possible
A	and then you sell your car as soon as possible
B	about to obviously pay for
A	yeah but I actually see that as a positive cos
B	what freshly MOT'd?
A	yeah it's but it's a selling point saying you know it's not gonna need a service or MOT for another year like that's a really big selling point
B	if it passes
A	yeah
A	erm
B	I'll talk to
A	well I haven't done any sums or anything this is just like me thinking off the top of my head I need to get rid of my car
B	no
A	it wasn't the Soap Awards it was the Pride of Britain you idiot
B	similar
A	and we didn't even end up watching all of that you went and played League
B	yeah it's

B	want that?
A	mm
B	really? does she wanna come round?
A	well
B	not now but
A	she basically said that was been she's obviously trying to ask her girls like her best friends erm to arrange like er drinks before she goes and like they basically all said they could only do Thursday next week and now they've all all but bailed and she's just like I don't think they understand I'm like moving away like they don't seem to give a shit
B	yeah well
A	it is shit
B	yeah well she's entitled to not so she should
A	no
B	she's entitled to
A	I'm a bit annoyed I don't know if her friends are like fully kind of comprehending the fact that like this is a really big move for her and it would be good to have some support
B	I think that all the time
A	mm
B	why's it yellow by the way?
A	probably cos it's been in that in that drawer it's
B	in that bag
A	it would be fine if it wasn't it's not even the tenth yet is it?
B	no
A	the tenth's tomorrow
B	we've got a big fridge
A	yeah
B	we'll use the fridge erm yeah that's a bit shit if she wants to pop over she should pop over
A	I think she's like quite happy to do a takeaway next week which would be good
B	yeah I said I'm not going out at work
A	she said she hasn't actually spoken to
B	oh
A	so she just assumes she
B	what day is it Friday?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I think I saw them the other
B	the other week
A	they were around yesterday
B	yeah
A	I don't know what to do about
B	oh are they calling you? they've got your number then?
A	they've got my mobile number
B	your mobile that's fine so long as they've got that erm
A	what one to one was it gonna be? just the catch up?
B	no it's like
A	your six months then
B	yeah
A	that's that's happening nearly a year in
B	well I had one yeah I dunno now
A	have you thought about what erm
B	I need a personal development plan
A	okay
B	a PDP
A	have you thought about like what you wanna talk to him about and what you wanna ask and stuff?
B	no he's not in on Monday he's not in tomorrow Monday I'm not in on Tuesday
A	but you need to have a serious think about what you wanna talk to him about
B	I know
A	I don't want you to go in there and be like yeah it's all fine
B	what?
A	more money
B	yeah
A	what do you have to do for more money and actually it shouldn't even be that you should kind of go in there saying actually I was made permanent it wasn't I was made permanent and it wasn't even discussed with me like I think in the last year like I've grown from strength to strength I I'm now in charge of like one of our largest customers you know they're really happy with the work that I'm doing for them on a on a day to day basis
B	can't say that
A	like I I think
B	cos obviously there are issues there but
A	yeah
B	there's always gonna be issues
A	I think and just sort of say you know I think it do deserve more money and that and the conversation was kind of skipped over by just announcing that I'd been made permanent without kind of talking to me about it I was little bit disappointed like obviously I'm happy to be made permanent but
B	yeah I've
A	it's
B	I've kind of said this to him
A	it's such a big thing and for them to just be like oh by the way now you're permanent and that that be it that's quite disappointing
B	yeah I know but
A	you should be allowed to fight your corner
B	when you look at the
A	yeah no I appreciate that but that's such a defeatist attitude to have to say oh nobody else in the office is being paid more so why would I ask for more?
B	it's not defeatist
A	it is
B	it's realist
A	you have to ask if you don't ask you don't get
B	I know
A	and even if he turns around and says oh I can't offer you more at this point you say right okay well I wanna know that if I do X Y and Z I will get more money cos otherwise there's no incentive
B	oops
A	all the personal development stuff is obviously important for you as well
B	I'm not like late all the time
B	all the time
A	okay
B	I just cut it fine
A	yeah
B	I cut it fine
A	well that that
B	when I lived
A	I almost feel like that looks just as bad as being late though like you walking into the office at one minute to nine when other people have been sat at their desk for fifteen minutes
B	I'm not getting paid enough to come in
A	you know what I'm saying though
B	I know I know shall I leave this for a bit yeah?
A	yeah they've probably got another twenty twenty-five minutes
B	well we're gonna do it like that
A	two are probably gonna do it like that
B	shall we just put a rack on top of
A	just put some tin foil on
B	erm
A	well what'll probably happen is that the fat will drip down and it won't just catch in that one
B	this sucks
A	so that's slightly redundant
B	well let's not waste that
A	okay
B	a whole strip that's retarded
A	we're about to
B	oh have we used this already?
A	well it didn't come with a lot I don't think did it?
B	five metres
A	oh
B	how have we used five metres already?
A	all those ribs of course
B	oh yeah all those ribs yeah
A	never mind that'll have to do
B	yeah I dunno
