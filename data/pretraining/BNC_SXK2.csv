C	with his mum
A	mum with and er with his nephew
B	what?
D	shut up
A	no there's a I'm not I'm not sure about the great grandad bit but
D	so you've made it up
A	no no
B	are you taking history as an option?
A	no no right so pretty much what happened was he he was like the grandad
B	who?
B	how can Hitler's dad be grandad to him?
C	because he's
A	because it's incest
C	he had sex with his daughter
A	he had sex with his nephew or something
B	nephew?
C	no he had sex with his daughter
B	did he?

D	which would make him his dad and grandad
C	yeah
A	yeah and then his dad was really strict on him and like beat him
C	yeah and then when his
C	and like give him sweets and stuff
A	and then but his mum always loved him
B	mm
D	ah
A	and so erm
B	I've forgotten where we were going with this
A	and then pretty much his dad died and then he's thought like what was the point in school?
D	his grandad's still alive?
A	no because his dad
A	and then and then
B	good question though yeah
A	and then he thought oh what was the point? and so but he wanted to do art
B	how old was he?
A	he was like it was high school
B	right
A	and then he wanted to do art so he took up like he was doing art but his dad wanted him to join the army but because his dad's dead and grandad is dead now
A	I'm just trying to make it clear his dad dad and grandad are dead now so erm he decided to do art and his mum supported him with it even though he left school at like the age of fifteen with no GCSEs or A levels or anything
C	I'd be naughty if my parents died
B	would you?
A	and his well his mum is still alive at this point but then his mum dies
B	what of?
A	his mum died of breast cancer I think
D	that's stupid
B	have you just made that up?
A	I think it's some sort of cancer so then he's
D	he's just making it up
A	just staring at his mum like naked and drawing pictures of her
B	when?
A	while while she was dead I know it's creepy isn't it? and he he
B	what?
A	didn't have a job so he
D	if this is your imagination I'm really worried
A	no no
B	are you gonna write this down for an exam cos I'm a little bit concerned?
A	and so he roamed the street erm whilst his mum was still alive because he didn't have a job so this is whilst he was alive and not alive and his mum was not alive so and that's he roamed the street
A	he
B	that's two separate countries you know that?
A	he was in one of them
B	right
A	and he and he was Austrian and then
B	right
A	and erm so he
B	why was he in Germany he just wondered there?
A	oh I dunno and then
D	was he just walking around?
A	yeah
B	when you say war broke out I mean he started the war?
D	no
A	no the First World War
B	oh okay well as long as we're clear on that
A	and then so he was in the First World War and then war broke out and he was in Germany so he applied and cos they needed everyone he got in and he was the messenger which was like one of the most erm jobs where you get killed and so like there would be a new one every like three and four months cos everyone got killed but he was like
B	so why would you apply?
A	cos he didn't know what it was gonna be
B	oh okay
A	but erm he was the messenger and he was there for four years
D	so he was quite a good messenger
A	well he was okay his dog saved him well once because he was running he was running er to
D	was his dog related to him?
A	no no shh shh he was running to a hut and then erm and his dog he was and his dog made a fool out of him and so
D	what did he say?
B	oh my goodness
A	and then so so his dog walked like ran out of the erm shelter thing that every where everyone was and so he ran after him and started beating him with him with a belt
B	what the dog?
A	yeah beating the he's weird and then a
B	oh
A	because he had ran out
B	after his dog
A	yeah
B	and he got saved
D	so did he keep beating his dog?
B	or did he
A	no
B	and say thanks for saving my life?
A	but but then there was something happened with his eyes didn't it? because there was gas his eyes went weird
B	did they?
D	oh did they?
B	well you say that like we're believing him
A	no well
B	are you believing much of this story? I'm not
A	it's true it's true and also do you know when he wanted to do art before he erm
B	mm
A	he erm he was assured that er that er a Jew person was head and told him that he could not er he couldn't be allowed into the school and so then er he he also had sort after that he heard someone else saying that the Jews just take their jobs and everything and that's where his hate for the Jews became
B	really?
A	because yeah
B	because a Jew wouldn't let him into art school?
A	yeah
D	so where did his hate for people that weren't of the true blood
A	what the blonde hair and?
D	yeah yeah the blonde hair and blue eyes?
A	no he thought he thought like that they were just stronger than everyone else
D	so he just made that bit up himself?
A	I think so yeah
B	was that like a bit of a
A	or he's or he might have had a friend that was like blonde and blue eyes
C	was he gay?
A	no I don't think so
C	I thought he was
B	really? it's like
A	and then erm
A	and he got like two iron crosses didn't he?
B	two what?
A	two iron crosses
B	mm
A	yeah he got two of those
C	and he's blonde with blue eyes so a perfect man for Hitler
B	I don't think
D	I don't think he is either he likes to sleep too much
B	yeah he likes to chill out
C	for all we know
B	so have you been doing this at school
A	yeah in history
D	do you think you perhaps need to erm ask for a revision class?

D	oh is that is what what's what does Mein Kampf
B	Mein Kampf means my fight
D	oh cos that's his book isn't it?
B	is it? I don't know

B	so how long are you doing him for as a topic?
B	a term?
D	mm have you got?
D	are you are you liking him?
A	that's why I knew he had a weird
B	oh
B	I got a little bit confused about the bit
D	so how are you gonna

D	style your moustache?
B	oh
A	use curlers mum's curlers
D	but so you are going for big
B	I haven't got any curlers

D	you weren't gonna do that cos Hitler had a big
A	yeah it's too much effort I might just shave it off
B	I haven't got any curlers
