A	okay I
B	oh that's a good question
C	I think if you were a prisoner on a pirate ship you'd probably do all their chores
B	mm?
C	you
B	but what if you were the actual pirate though?
C	oh if you were an actual pirate you'd er have to go to bed very early because pirates are actually quite civilised people by themselves although once they meet another ship they're very very hostile
B	but you're right we saw that on Horrible Histories that they had a
C	mm
B	and lots of rules to live by what would your pirate name be
C	mm that would depend if I was a captain or not
B	mm
C	cos if I was a captain I would have a really cool name
A	does it have to rhyme?
B	no
A	okay if I was captain
C	mm
B	Captain Shark?
A	yeah
B	okay cool
A	and if I was a normal pirate
B	sorry?
A	if I was normal
B	a normal pirate?
A	I'd be called Jolly
C	Jolly
B	Jolly
C	mm
B	okay
C	erm cos that's a cool
B	mm
C	name
B	yeah very fierce
C	and if I was a normal pirate I'd be something like Dagger
B	okay
C	mm
B	if I was a normal pirate and
A	or er Red Berry oh
B	or Red Berry
A	shiny
B	yes the villain that's in our book erm
C	mm shiny
B	Captain Purple Hair
A	mum you don't have purple hair there
B	mm?
A	purple hair wasn't invented back then
B	I could dye my hair with erm blueberries
A	they didn't have blueberries back then
B	they did have blueberries back then
A	or couldn't get them
C	obviously you could
B	okay erm
C	mum you could get blueberries
B	Captain Scarface
A	cool
B	cos I'm sure I would have nasty scars all over my face
C	or Garfield
B	mm?
A	what if I was your daughter?
C	Captain Garfield
A	what if I was your daughter?
B	then we'd all be pirates together wouldn't we?
A	yeah but what if I didn't follow the rules?
B	what if you didn't follow the rules? I'd have to make you walk the plank
A	no mum you wouldn't cos I'm your daughter
B	well that depends er if you were rude to me in front of my crew
A	then I would
B	I might lock you up for a bit
A	then I would say mama and I would
A	and then you would need to have to get me out
B	you think?
A	yeah
C	you know what? I don't think lady pirates actually had children
B	I don't think they did I think that would've been quite tricky
A	why?
B	well it would've been a bit awkward having a child on a ship wouldn't it?
A	no like if you had the child on land
B	mm
B	I know but you don't want a child seeing piratey things do you?
C	well
A	no
C	they would think it's normal
A	a child pirate
B	mm?
A	it could be a it could be it could be a pirate child?
B	yes I know but it's it would be very dangerous for them wouldn't it? unless they had a good hiding space what if their ship what if their parents got killed and their ship got set fire to?
C	mm
A	I know but then they would be a spy for another crew
B	well no they'd probably die on the ship wouldn't they?
A	no they wouldn't they'd go into the ocean they'd find their dad tell him that their mum has died and be with him
C	babies are erm
B	okay
C	babies are practically invincible
B	okay
C	but
B	so they'd somehow swim the ocean?
A	no their dad
C	well they could make friends with a shark
C	because babies are very very clever
B	what sort of adventures would we get up to?
C	eating the world's biggest doughnut
B	pirate adventures
C	eating the world's biggest
B	we'd get lots of
C	pirate
B	treasure I hope
A	yeah
C	I didn't
B	so to make them rich
C	or to er or just for the fun of getting it
B	yeah just the fun of it
C	mm
A	uhu
C	although if your ship did get raided
B	mm?
C	then er
B	but darling that's why they used to bury their treasure on islands so that
A	mm yeah
B	do you see?
A	cos their ship wouldn't hold much more
B	mm
A	and
B	obviously it was very tricky if you forgot which island you'd left it on or lost your map or anything like that
A	mum?
B	would we be nice to other people? or would we just kill everybody?
C	well
A	we could be nice pirates do you know what nice pirates do?
C	they don't kill people they shoot their leg
A	so mum?
B	well you could still die from that but yes
B	mm in the book
A	yeah
B	yeah we could be nice pirates
A	and we just like we'd we'd be friends with
B	or we could have a very very fierce reputation which would scare everybody
A	I don't want this
B	don't have to whisper what is it?
A	I don't want this piece
B	alright well don't eat it then
C	and can I have er please have a dessert?
B	er well hang on a minute you had an Easter nest before you had your dinner
A	I
C	yeah?
B	so what are you planning on having now?
C	an Easter nest
B	no
C	why not?
B	you can have some grapes or something like that
C	or an Easter nest
B	no because you've just
C	oh
B	if we had a very fierce reputation people would be so scared of us that they would do whatever we asked anyway so we wouldn't need to actually
A	well
B	hurt anybody I think we should do that
A	no way
C	yeah but how do we get the fierce reputation?
B	just by telling everybody what do you mean no way
A	I wanna be friends
B	sorry?
A	I wanna be friends as a pirate
C	oh I could have some chocolate
B	you want to be friends?
A	yeah with people
C	oh alright have some Easter chocolate
C	okay?
B	if we were really nice would we?
C	Easter chocolate then we could quit our job
B	sorry?
C	then we could just quit our job
B	no we well we oh I don't want to quit my job
C	mum is this good enough Easter chocolate?
B	mm
B	I don't want to quit my job I want to be a pirate
A	yeah and kill people
B	yeah shoot them set fire to their boats
A	mum?
B	steal their treasure yeah
C	blast em with machine guns
B	no no no
C	why not?
B	cos we're talking about old-fashioned pirates they didn't have machine guns
C	okay
C	or loads of guns
B	cannons
C	er loads of guns tied together
B	okay
C	so that it's like
B	what job in history then would you like to do?
C	mm
A	be a kitchen maid
B	you'd like to be a kitchen maid? that's very long hours and lots of hard work
A	yeah
C	I wouldn't mind working with Shakespeare
B	oh that's a good idea
A	yeah mm I would like to work with Shakespeare
B	would you like to help him write his plays? or would you like to be an actor? or make the costumes? or sell the tickets?
A	make the costumes
B	mm
C	and work with Shakespeare
B	but
C	as in writing scripts with him
B	mm
C	a script by Shakespeare
B	and
C	and
B	uhu
C	and I would say
A	and then I could do costumes by
B	mm
A	I could and I could like say hi
C	I could also find out
C	find out what he actually looked like
B	mm right hang on what did you say
A	I could like say when I'm working hi
B	mm
A	then I can say
C	yeah
C	and when I've read back to the in er
B	and he er hang on he would say what?
A	if when we had break
B	yes he'd say a Midsummer Night's Dream and then you said something what did you say?
A	and then I said cool what's in it?
B	oh I see
C	yeah I could
B	hang on come over to the back to the table first
A	like every costume
B	all of the costumes?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah like queen Titania's
B	yes Titania would need a sparkly one
A	I wonder how
B	sit down
A	I'll do Romeo and Juliet's one
B	I don't a nice floaty costume for Juliet you could give Shakespeare your jokes
B	he did collaborate with other writers
A	I'm done
C	yeah but I mean like I could write the scripts
B	mm
C	and become as famous as him
B	mm that'd be very cool yeah I mean there were other writers at the time who he was friends with Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson but we know about them but they're not half as famous as he is but some er one of Ben Jonson's plays The Alchemist which is my favourite Ben Jonson play is being performed at Stratford this year so that's very exciting
B	they hardly ever show it
C	I
B	well we know what his house has looked like cos it's in Stratford
C	yeah but I mean like when it was in that time
B	yes and as you say you would know exactly what he looked like and if he was
B	if he was a really nice person I think he was cos he did
A	mum
B	have lots of friends but
A	er
B	it would be nice to know him
C	yeah
A	on erm
B	yes?
A	Shakespeare week we actually saw a film and went inside the Shakespeare house
B	well we nearly well I've been there and we nearly went when erm into the house when we were at Stratford didn't we? but then we ran out of time so it would be nice to go and visit it again
A	finished
C	erm they did an X-ray scan and apparently someone's stolen his head
B	really? I haven't seen the findings of that that was a couple of weeks ago wasn't it?
A	mm
B	someone has stolen his head?
C	that's what it seemed like
B	really? so who told you that?
C	er it might've been you might've been dad
A	caught some disease
B	mm mm he went out partying on his birthday I think and then got sick
A	oh mm
B	I'm pretty sure that's how he died
A	can I have some chocolate?
B	er some more chocolate? right well what is it that you require?
A	nest
B	an Easter nest go on then and then at least they will be gone by tomorrow
A	what?
C	why are there thousands er why are there more erm er my?
B	cupcake cases? doesn't matter they're hard to separate sometimes aren't they?
C	mm
A	there's some more on there

C	mm
B	you've got tomorrow when we go to do our circus workshop at the actual circus we'll have to wear

A	aerial
C	mm
B	if they've
C	with me
B	mm
A	me too
B	yeah
C	I think I'm also going to be doing some hoop work
B	will you? well only if you get the
A	I really wanna be a tightrope walker
B	well there is a tightrope isn't there in the circus?
C	uhu
B	so have you had a? no you haven't had a
C	mum?
C	I'm not sure if they'd accept you as a grown-up
B	oh well officially I'm a grown-up aren't I?
C	yeah
A	no you're not
C	cos they would they might think you're lying
B	I no I look I look like a grown-up
A	no you don't
C	you do not you look
B	oh
C	much younger
C	far too pretty
A	will children have to be accompanied by an adult?
B	I guess so I don't know if if I wasn't doing the circus myself I don't know if I would need to stay with you or anything I probably would anyway but erm and I don't know how many children will turn up but it's very nice of the circus people to let us all come and have a look
A	mm
B	so that'll be rather good won't it?
C	mm
B	we'll have to just ignore the clowns
A	I don't really like clowns
B	I never liked clowns
A	just their face
B	except Pierrot or Pierrot clowns you know the black and white sad clowns?
A	yeah
B	but no I don't like I don't like clowns in the circus but everything else I like
C	erm well I only need two
B	oh but it'd be nice if you found the other one I would like to
C	and ask him to show us the advert

C	I think they're called AT-ATs
B	oh I think they're called AT-ATs aren't they?
C	mm
B	oh I don't know don't ask me
A	well er I think AT-ATs does sound better than AT-ATs because it sounds like
B	eighty

B	yeah sounds like the number rather than the letters I do love your Easter pictures by the way really cute bunny and squirrel
A	and chick
B	and where's the chick? oh yeah oh a tiny tiny chick one of the clouds looks a little bit like a chicken as well
