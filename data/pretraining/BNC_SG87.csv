B	this is where we differ cos I know you'll have loved it won't ya?
B	but I thought about
A	I loved the film
B	I thought about a six or seven out of ten
A	I loved the film
B	yeah
A	but I love the comic books more
B	right okay
A	so the film good as a film as a stand-alone film if you go
B	not knowing what it's about
A	not knowing what it's about you'd think it was a good film
B	yeah yeah it was good I just didn't people have been saying it's better than Avengers and that and I was like no it's not better than Avengers
A	no
A	mm
B	I thought that was
A	the second one is the best one so far
B	Avengers is a good film I loved Avengers
A	yeah me too
B	erm what else? Iron Man got like Iron Man one was good Iron Man two were a bit like good and Iron Man three was shit
A	yeah it's totally about it's not about being a superhero is it? like it's about his mental
A	yeah
A	and no one gives a shit about that
B	you wanna see Iron Man beating up some cool people you don't wanna see him all the film not in a suit then when he does get in a suit they always break like right at the end of it
A	yeah
B	he must break about ten of em and you're like what?
A	no I agree I'm a massive Marvel whore
B	oh that's erm is that erm does that mean
A	yeah
A	I'm a Marvel whore
B	well erm
A	I just don't get people who didn't read comic books when they were growing up I just don't understand it
B	I used to read loads of Simpsons comics when I were a kid
A	yeah I did
A	and erm
B	mm
A	I used to read them as well
A	no do you know why? because it's like South Park they can do an episode in a week
B	right
A	so they normally keep up with the current current state of affairs
B	yeah
A	yeah? whereas Simpsons or Futurama they take six months for one episode
B	right
A	and that's why you have to wait so long for new ones to come out
B	yeah
A	and erm cos the drawings and the animation takes so long whereas cos South Park is so basic it doesn't take that long
B	they did erm an episode about
A	yeah
B	and everything and I was like fuck me that's that's a work rate like that
A	but in Simpsons or Futurama they can't do that
B	right
A	cos it takes them six months per episode
A	whereas
B	but
A	as a kid but as an adult
A	mm
B	formerly Chuck's and I was like
A	no
B	but it's little things like that I'm like fuck me that's that's a really dirty joke that they've put in
B	I
A	oh I love Friends
B	I used to think Friends were hilarious but now I watch it I'm like yeah that's dirty as well
A	the same as Shrek
A	and old Disney films Pixar films just so many adult jokes in there you don't get as a kid
B	I find them brilliant now
A	yeah
B	plus my mum and dad would've been taking me to watch em and be sat there going these are actually good films
A	I saw that
B	and she said she said that were
A	cos there are no adult jokes
B	yeah there's nothing like this all based around cutesy kids stuff
A	I saw on Facebook the other day cos I follow erm I follow all Marvel people like Downey junior oh my god the things I would do to him seriously the
B	I I I bought a T-shirt because he wears it in Avengers
A	I've I've got a T-shirt the Black Sabbath one?
B	Black Sabbath one
A	yeah that's right
B	no way
A	yeah
B	oh brilliant cos I got that
A	I've got that same T-shirt but
B	I bought it to
A	because he he wore it always erm in the second one he's walking off in with the thing and he's getting undressed and he's wearing the black one with the triangle
B	yeah ah
A	and the circle
A	they're alright
B	they're good but I did think erm I didn't think they were like amazing but I the one that I've got
A	yeah
B	have you seen have you seen Sherlock Holmes?
A	mm
B	I I love that
A	it's fantastic
B	I'm half way through the second one now and I think it's brilliant
A	I love his arrogance
B	yeah
A	it's not arrogance though is it? it's like confidence more than arrogance
B	the thing is he he's still like he's in
A	he's not
B	yeah that one
A	no I've got that one I've got the other one erm it's got like a triangle and circle around it and it's Black Sabbath
B	right
A	can't remember which one it is like which film I saw it in but I've got it
B	that's weird feel like even the T-shirt
A	we are the same person but you're a ginger-headed male
B	and
A	I've got tits so
B	I bet you'll definitely win it
A	I've got tits so I win
B	yeah glorious tits
A	as long as erm you've got tits you win
A	it is true but it's unfair
B	thing is as a girl you can find other girls beautiful as a boy I can't find other other men
A	yes
B	yeah
A	he's on my list
B	yeah
A	he's is on my list
B	erm there's another beaut as well can't think of who the other one is
A	cos if you think Ryan Reynolds is beaut I've literally fancied him since day
B	have you seen a film called The Weigh In?
A	the what?
B	the Weigh In it's about erm a restaurant that er you know the the geeky kid off of Dodgeball? erm I think he's called Justin Long the act the actor yeah
A	with black hair?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm he's in the Weigh In with Ryan Reynolds and a couple of other famous actors and that's a brilliant hilarious film that I had never seen
A	is it really good?
B	yeah he's hilarious Ryan Reynolds I didn't know that he was that funny
A	yeah he's a really funny guy
B	he's got that deadpan humour where he says summat funny but then he has got a straight face and then it makes it more hilarious
B	I'm terrible at
A	can't lie like my mum
B	I'll watch out for that then
A	but if I'm specifically lying I will like go like that
B	right
A	and I used to do it as a kid apparently and
A	I don't know if I still do it now but
B	I'll watch out for it
B	I'll have to
A	who knows
B	it's all about eye contact as well you can tell if someone's lying
A	I can
B	I can't I find it I find it hard to to talk to someone
A	I am a black woman with a six inch penis
A	I did
B	I don't know if you're doing it now but
A	no
B	I think maybe you are a black woman with a six inch penis
A	I really like
B	are you expecting

B	but
A	and what sorry?
A	well where do you go?
B	well if I go round town in Doncaster there's only like three or four places that I actually can
A	where?

B	no
B	he goes to me he goes to me er I says ah my mate
B	all my mates know you as that fit one
B	I didn't wanna tell you that cos I thought it would go to your head
A	you think they're
A	well
B	as long as you know that I think you are
A	of course I know you think you are I think you are know you think I oh my god well I think you're fit okay
A	yeah
A	no one is actually listening to this picking out words okay? part of my degree is erm so you do a research project and you have a text say this text is twenty thousand pages you click you type in a word and it finds how many times this word appears in this text
B	right so you get paid
A	same recording
A	yeah if you if you click fit in our conversations and recordings
B	it'll come up with a load of saying you're fit rather
A	it'll come up no it'll come up fit and it'll say the context of the conversation
B	right
A	so it'll tell you what comes before
B	and it might have been about
A	the last full stop
B	yeah
A	the so the speaking corpus works as erm I think you are fit that's one sentence I do think that but that is one sentence okay? erm and how the corpus works is you you type a certain word in that you're looking for and it'll come up in that sentence it won't bring anything before that it won't bring up anything after that so it'll be full stop to full stop or if you're American period to period
B	yeah which I'm not
A	so no I'm not either
B	bet you wish you were though
A	I love America do you know what? the American's love the English accent so much
A	they were fucking bumming it if I were there on my own I could have shagged so many people not even gonna lie not that I wanted to but I could have
B	yeah
