B	yeah I don't
A	now I've done half of the
B	I don't know why we did that didn't make any
A	I think it was confused because last year it was the
B	mm
A	did it
B	okay so
B	well we could just do it together and then just know what to do right go through assessment PPT slides one to nine okay so let's have a look this is gonna take fifteen minutes right so listening listening's fifty-five percent?
A	yeah cos they've separated the vocabulary exam
B	yeah okay timing huh? twenty minutes? okay
A	mid-semester exam
B	speaking eight minutes okay so that'll only take five minutes to go through?
A	hang on so for the first through to slide nine
B	well you you write on it and then you can photocopy it
A	well what about you?
B	I I don't usually write on it? I just look at the slides
A	yeah?
B	yeah but I'd like to see it
A	sorry
A	okay erm five minutes?
B	well that's being generous but yeah probably less than that
A	and
B	okay and then the weeks okay so that's the academic vocabulary in use
A	and they do those tests on Moodle?
B	yeah they're the ones on Moodle
A	yeah?
B	yeah

A	are they serious? that can't be right
B	dunno that's what it says
A	I'm not going to rephrase that
B	okay we'll just yeah er and then speaking yeah we've done all that already
A	mm
B	so this is gonna all this will probably take five minutes actually it said the first nine slides didn't it?
A	oh
B	so one two five six you'll be able to answer the questions yeah yeah yeah all that what do we have to do for our speaking and then listening? erm
B	huh?
A	if you need to improve your listening
B	oh yeah
A	do more practice
A	if your pronunciation is not clear try to improve it
B	oh I thought he was taking the piss
A	no
A	what can I do? well you've got so many resources

A	well that's the problem we had last time
B	not keeping it not keeping it for the whole year
A	I kept mine from last year when it erm only had a few notes on but it was quite useful
B	okay week one so I've only got the first lesson here
A	okay
B	mm
A	I'd like to look at all of them like cos
B	yeah
A	I've got so many international students in my class
B	mm
A	they're just gonna be bombarding me with questions I know it
A	for on I wanna remind myself I'm so glad I've at least taught the course once
B	mm okay student's work through exercises in groups and then review as a class twenty minutes
A	huh
A	oh understanding your textbook thing? yeah?
B	yeah
A	need to make it more of a quiz
B	understanding your textbook is that just page six? is that it?
A	yeah
B	yeah and there's an answer PPT so how many units are there? blah blah
A	as long as the answers are on the PPT that's alright
B	what are margins?
A	look at page forty-six
B	this book not that book
A	no it's this book
B	huh?
A	this book they've got to do the quiz on from this
A	book onto this book
B	oh my god
A	that's why I've just now emailed all of the student's and said don't forget both books because we can't do a book quiz if you haven't got this one yeah
B	yeah I might have to do the same now as well
A	erm
B	okay well that's gonna take twenty minutes yeah?
A	why has it highlighted these killer diseases?
B	where?
A	here cos there's a task? cos there's a task isn't it? every all of the highlighted ones have a blue task next to it
B	yeah
A	okay check back for the names of these killer diseases highlight them
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	so that's twenty minutes
B	and then making connections using that so we're not using this book we're only using it for the first page er
A	have you got your PPTs?
B	skills and strategies yeah so first of all we talk about this course a little bit the aims of it
A	mm
B	and that's five minutes
A	yeah
B	understanding your textbook
B	okay look you've got all the answers here
A	okay
B	erm text two?
A	ow my toe hurts
A	it keeps going through these pangs
B	try this site before wanking?
A	how come that girl has popped up on Wiziwig?
B	I'm trying to watch the football
A	no register no cost no bollocks
A	meet women but
B	it doesn't look like the football's gonna work does it?
A	no you'll probably get some weird porn come up ow
B	right erm
A	er yeah I've got this one here are we actually doing reading? huh
B	looks like it
A	oh man on your first class?
A	oh not this do you remember this?
B	huh?
A	okay
B	no
A	continue your ideas page six?
A	hang on whereabouts are we? it's just complicated cos you've got so many pieces of paper telling you to do different things er that one page two to six
B	what's SP?
A	I don't really know what
B	skills practice what? so they're doing all of that?
A	all of that yeah
B	is that what I've got the answers for here? SP one SP two SP three
A	and I haven't made notes in my book for that particular chapter though
B	there you go
A	yeah okay
B	that's my book isn't it?
A	no
B	huh?
A	no cos look that's my
B	huh?
A	that's mine
B	is it?
A	yeah look at that messy handwriting
B	oh okay hang on what are the kind of questions are they?
A	continuing your ideas er
B	I still don't understand what they're supposed to do what do
A	key skills and strategies
B	but the exercises don't start for another
A	there
B	two so they've gotta read that first?
A	page four we've got to go through this first yeah that's the difficult part of the class it's it's like
B	continuing ideas okay so it's referring back so this these yeah? and using subjects
A	what? just let them read it on their own? or what?
B	just get them to start reading things out in class
B	mm
A	okay
B	mm?
A	mm strategies
B	uhu
A	look for these markers
B	yeah
A	ask yourself what a continuing idea of a marker refers to use your knowledge of vocabulary general word synonyms and word families
B	mm mm okay
A	oh okay
B	that's easy enough and then find the noun that best continues the idea ah I remember those though a lot of them are so interchangeable
A	oh god
B	do you remember? and they go well
A	oh no
B	do you remember?
A	oh
A	but they've got to fit all ten in so
B	yeah so for the purpose of the exercise there's only one way it works so
A	yeah
B	erm and then this one what do they do?
A	oh they're just connecting the two sentences together basically in order to answer the question they've got to realise the answer to the question isn't in just one sentence it's in two
B	right what?
A	the answer to the question is in two sentences not one
A	that's it
B	what? no hang on students who have no interest in school often disturb high school classes this this?
A	oh no that's
B	no that's this one
A	oh yeah here that is the marker this is the marker yeah? and then you've got a question what may stop
B	oh so you've gotta do two things?
A	yeah they've got to circle the marker
A	are you drawing on my book? I I usually do it in pencil okay
B	okay circle marker and answer the question
A	and answer the question
B	right okay makes sense now yeah ah we scored and I missed the bloody thing ah bloody internet
A	that's cos
A	that girl just popped up instead
A	instead of the goal
A	yeah?
B	hang on skills practice three what's that?
A	here
B	oh is that after the break?
A	no before the break
B	okay
A	find the noun that best continues an idea from the first sentence of each item bold face words may help you
B	oh okay so the first three tests these attempts? no er failures?
A	first
B	okay
A	the government believes that the education system is weak these
B	views
A	views okay
B	attitudes? can you not have attitudes?
B	these views these attitudes? erm this is where it gets stupid cos in the first class they're you're going oh well yeah book could mean that or it it's just
A	yeah no no it's not good is it?
B	not good is it?
A	so don't do them question by question
B	yeah
A	make sure they do them all and fit them in
B	and then see if yeah
A	see if one fits better than the other
B	if there's two yeah yeah and try and give a reason
B	okay next
A	on the Powerpoint
B	the Powerpoint?
A	or the answers here
B	er what's this? huh?
A	no
B	it's that that's something different isn't it? I think this is something different
A	it's probably for the next time
B	test test two is more academic
A	noun-based writing is one point two
B	eh?
A	one point two because do you remember this course they put the Powerpoints all together?
B	really?
A	yeah
B	so there's no Powerpoints here?
A	no
A	oh man there's no
B	only up to is this Powerpoint?
A	yeah
B	oh that's just the book quiz
A	yeah
B	and that's it?
A	and then you're in this book
B	and there's no
A	no Powerpoints
B	oh you've got the answers in there
A	is there not even any homework?
B	oh I dunno let's get to that at the end so unit one world health so er shall we just do that and then just continue? oh god what a
A	oh god how
B	pre-reading as a group
A	they'll never get this done
B	pre-reading?
B	what about this?
A	yeah they're the pre-reading tasks
B	okay well hang on but pre-reading ten minutes? so they've gotta read that and that?
A	active reading twenty minutes
B	oh active reading oh okay oh okay
B	uhu oh okay what's the answer? how has the change affected people's behaviour? oh god I hate these kind of questions
A	so we need these on a Powerpoint these question these first sentences don't we?
B	er
A	and for them to think of the questions it answers
B	mm?
A	mm
B	what?
A	I'd like to do that erm
B	really?
A	have yeah it's so dry so boring put first
B	the last decades
A	age eight okay well we're that's similar to
B	but what was the answers?
A	well it's kind kind of here and then you should just go one two three four
B	yeah but what's the answer?
A	it's erm this page
A	three A three B have you got your book?
B	no
A	active reading whole class activity
B	page eight
A	mm
B	just read it
A	but you gotta do these blue boxes I think
B	check back and highlight the words that show its meaning is that all in here?
A	mm
B	yeah okay
A	mm
B	shift in attitude
A	that's
B	now people understand
A	people tended to think improving their own health
A	can I underline that?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	okay and the third one check back
A	erm
B	the meaning of the improvement
A	like the whole idea is basically the whole paragraph look
B	yeah it's often like that in this book
A	yeah
B	it's just getting them to
A	yeah
B	mm
A	kind of activities
B	mm
A	because the the Chinese students are actually quite good at this kind of thing
B	no I'm I'm hopeless at this kind of thing
A	yeah
B	seriously if I was in a class I'd be I can't
A	well
B	sit there and think if I was walking around I could do it I can't sit in a chair and do that kind of thing
A	mm

A	complete in groups then display answers well
B	well displaying answers we've got a PDF so we're just gonna have to
A	I might I might give them
B	you just have to maximise it and er zoom in on it and scroll it up and down
A	yeah
B	it's just shit that is
