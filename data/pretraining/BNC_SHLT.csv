D	mm
A	sometimes you've promised somebody that you be somewhere and you're
C	that's really weird cos
D	mm
C	I've never had to do that

C	or most most of them have got these lug things in haven't they
B	I don't know
C	when will you when?
A	they have their own set
C	they can't all have their own set because they it's it's the television that own the stuff

C	in
C	yeah and and
B	what was that programme?
A	you never think about that actually
B	well there's no point is there
C	mm
D	mm
B	it is good though isn't it
A	mm
C	well that's half the problem isn't it
A	yeah we sterilise things too much
