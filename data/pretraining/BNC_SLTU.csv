A	okie dokie
B	okay
A	what are you doing?
B	taking their coat off
A	truly special
B	that's really special
A	going now
B	yeah
A	you stupid woman
B	that was quite spectacular
A	oh she's now moving
B	oh good
A	right
B	right
A	debacle
B	debacle
A	I like that word
B	debacle is a lovely word isn't it?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	er one of us
A	yes but one of us going around separately would be me
B	or
A	sorry?
B	or
A	so you're honestly going to send her off to do it by herself?
B	you know it's not necessarily a communal thing circuits
A	okay
B	all three of us yeah
B	you can request it I'm sure
A	which makes life better
B	it was hard work erm you know was er
A	it's going
B	no no I mean it was erm harder than normal I think and as you say it was at the hardest year and not a lot of people said yeah
A	and not a lot of people said yeah?
B	no they did a lot of people did
A	you actually did say not
B	yeah
A	oh
B	Don't feel bad
B	oh I'm really sorry chuck
A	I'm looking forward to that
B	well to a certain extent it's generally
A	A circuit
B	yeah
A	so
B	no that's the one I couldn't
A	right
B	and she can use the gym straightaway kind of thing
A	okay well we'll do that
B	go down later Monday
A	yeah
B	yeah so I mean
A	kind of first time go down
B	yeah
A	on on Monday
B	okay well I mean
B	even if just
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah exactly
A	okay
B	I think the thought was moving out and stay out the way of the
A	yeah
B	lane
A	but but fundamentally
B	but then if I could
A	it could mean I was going to cause an accident and you don't do it
B	well you didn't
A	well to be fair if I had thought a bit more ahead I would have given him more room to do it but on the other hand
B	yeah yeah he was definitely in the wrong
A	yeah
B	A bit of a
A	and it's er what was it a Peugeot thingamabob?
B	thing
A	A tall thing
B	yeah
A	does he want to give you the car?
B	I doubt it
A	well bearing in mind I was half contemplating that an automatic might be good for you for some drivers
B	yeah
A	just getting used to the experience on the road without having to bother to bother you about gears
B	yeah and then put them in at the end
A	because you you've been troubled with the clutches and it's just your ability to select gears at the appropriate junction is problematic
B	yeah
A	with an automatic you wouldn't have to worry about that
B	yeah
A	you know it's not
B	sorry
A	you've just hurt my eyes and it's really distracting
B	sorry yeah
B	yeah yeah sorry
B	erm I imagine he'll just sell it to one of the
A	fair enough
B	I don't really know how
A	so but he doesn't want at sixty?
B	er no
A	possibly wise
B	yeah
A	yes
B	and it's maybe a
A	yes
B	and I think maybe
A	well it's not yeah it's not entirely unreasonable to expect families to do
B	no I mean I think my dad's been doing it willingly and hasn't minded doing it and it's not exactly like it's a problem getting there
A	try
B	it's cool isn't it? And those are massive handlebars
A	yeah
A	yes
B	help him out
A	it's the one member of that family family is still working
B	I think my mam really can't er can't do it
A	when is she planning on retiring?
B	well she was planning on retiring the minute she hits sixty and but there's been no talk of it so presumably she's keeping going while things are still kind of
A	interesting
B	yeah I think that's maybe the thought erm
A	oh and
B	yeah
A	again but that would interfere with you know choir and tea-drinking
B	well exactly
A	but but you could  you could certainly you know fit in I don't know
B	A six-hour shift on a Saturday probably
A	yeah
A	yeah exactly it wouldn't kill you
A	exactly it wouldn't kill you
B	not a lot of money
A	but
B	depending on what you're doing but it would be better than
A	well no I mean you can probably get something like about eight if you're lucky ten quid an hour
B	yeah
A	around ten
B	yeah so is it eight quid now probably?
A	if you were creative so what like it's eight times six and that's er forty-eight fifty quid a week you know that's
B	yeah
A	that would be  that would be  below tax you'd actually get all of it
B	food
A	the vast majority of your your living expenses food
B	yeah
A	erm
A	but
B	I guess you you know it's that or you can put the kind of the extra hours in to work and sort of go over and above what you need to do
A	but she won't be doing that
B	well
A	as in you know I'm perfectly sure that erm if you go over and above without that
B	hmm probably
A	as in yeah
B	er I don't know I don't think it's the worst I think
A	no but it's nothing it would not be comparable to Oxbridge
B	no no
A	as
B	as in you couldn't
A	well no any subjects could English could objectively
B	yeah
A	yeah but you'd need to try and
B	yeah
A	if you wanted to
B	I mean I don't know
B	I don't know whether she said this and my dad said
B	there's no way you're getting a job
A	no but it's the household this is your household there will not have been any conversation
B	hmm
A	you know that
B	in all fairness though
A	not all good conversations
B	she usually does
A	I wouldn't call them conversations
B	well the fact is she was very kind of open about how she was feeling all the time
A	well no that wasn't bringing stuff like that up it was being inappropriate with just inappropriate levels of discussion about me that's attention-seeking not really stuff like that
B	but I can imagine her bringing that up though
B	no but I can imagine there would be I can imagine her thinking about that and then talking about it
A	I can't I don't think it's ever really occurred to her
B	well I I disagree I think she
A	well no I mean you were fairly involved in the discussion about what to do at uni it was
B	well no but I don't there's no reason for me to be involved in the discussion of if if
A	I know but
B	it has been brought up
A	but actually maybe because to some extent it it does affect you because it's a disparity between the support that two daughters have received and you being one of them
B	mm
A	and actually financially it makes more sense to stay at Oxford if I can
B	what because she'd have started
A	yeah exactly
B	well
A	what you could do with that time?
B	I mean I did tell her to sort of make sure she did something
A	but she wasn't even on Job Seeker's Allowance for fuck's sake
B	I did tell her to make sure she did something with it and she didn't really and which is such a shame because it was a really good opportunity to get some really good solid even unpaid work just working for that for six months would have been incredible for her CV
A	learn a foreign language
B	yeah
A	learning to drive
B	yeah
A	you know
B	go travelling
A	yes that
B	true yeah
A	anything that
B	you could probably go and work in another country is what a lot of people would do
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but anything just sitting on your arse and apart from everything else from a CV perspective that's just chronic
B	no I know that's the thing
A	yeah
B	I mean I didn't particularly do an awful lot after leaving uni between getting a job but I was
A	no you were job hunting fairly intensively
B	so I was very intensively
A	yeah I mean retrospectively you know possibly could have learnt to drive
B	I could have
A	well no the thing is you were making use of it and to some extent you'd finished your degree and you'd earned a break
B	yeah yeah I I did have really golden summer I wasn't intensively
A	right yeah erm that's again you just
B	yeah
A	I mean I couldn't slow down after I let him in but I mean
B	no
A	I couldn't move out so he had to stop and he didn't quite twig as in he didn't stop
B	no no
A	because he came in unexpectedly
B	yeah not enough time
A	now that is why dual carriageways are so much more dangerous than motorways
B	yes
A	oh yes good
B	oh there's a sign the guy with a sign for the George Inn
A	oh
B	oh
A	maybe it's the same guy
B	at least it's a nice day today I suppose
A	maybe you know so
B	yeah
A	worst employee of the last month gets
B	yeah gets the shifts
A	so you're coming off there so we're literally on the four one junction
B	yeah that makes sense
B	four lads
B	I don't know I mean it's actually quite weird sort of think thinking back to all the interviews and stuff I did and how just how much better qualified I am now to do things
A	one of the you've always done very not fortunate but you did very well as in it'll take you further on you know
B	no
B	yeah
A	lots of erm graduate improvement days which I can
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah but how can you work cooperatively in a team of people you are competing against? It's a situation it's a skill which is not acquired in
B	yes
B	yes it's a ridiculous
A	this is barmy
B	balance to ask you to strike
A	in this situation you need to show that you are better than everyone else
B	yeah
A	and but you are decisive
B	yeah it's it's
A	you can't achieve that that's almost impossible
B	yeah
A	A mental dichotomy
B	I'm very glad that the things I was going for didn't require that because it's a very odd thing to have to do
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	right
B	for the academic
A	but if you were anything like qualified to do that
B	no no it just doesn't matter that's just the the name we've been given as a group
A	yes
B	erm
A	I mean that's a year year's contract
B	exactly and you know it's got quite a lot of erm recruiting time and effort on their part and you sort of feel a bit sorry for the two who just definitely won't get it
A	I would just pick one of them if I was you
B	what from the first interview to and then pick one of them to give a presentation?
A	yeah and then if they don't
B	if they don't do it then
A	like it
B	yeah
A	yeah that's a bit weird
B	I had somebody ring me up yesterday and she was very sweet but she rings me up a lot and asks me things that she knows
A	but not you
B	well that's the thing she hasn't actually submitted anything so I don't know what she's going to produce she's erm she sent me the this thing that
A	what is she doing sorry she's transcribing?
B	she's a recorder
A	oh
B	so she's just doing this
A	oh right
B	so yeah but she's like taking it quite seriously and she's doing she's at the
B	yeah and
A	where is
B	near
A	I didn't even know that was a place let alone a university
B	so there's a university there apparently erm and I think it must be quite small
A	is it just her?
B	and she sent an advert out in the newsletter asking for people to help with her research which was a little bit dodgy erm I mean
A	how do you mean?
B	Cos it's not her research she's being paid to provide recordings
A	yeah
B	you tell somebody you earn money which I'm I'm a little bit gutted with but it did explain under the headline the headline was a bit dodgy but the rest of it was just our advert
A	versus our approach of just
B	just conversing
A	yeah
B	but I'm going to feel a bit bad if it's not er you know if it's not very good stuff because she's clearly
B	yeah
A	erm
B	sorry?
A	Silver
B	oh right I thought you said  I thought you said
A	erm so she
B	well I don't know
A	yeah yeah
B	that she doesn't really know very much about work and so I think
A	never having done any obviously
B	well I think she's still half thinking about the teaching which will be good
A	it's strange she's never been in paid employment in any capacity actually thinking about it
B	mm
A	as in sort of even when I was at school and this is me I had a part-time job as in I did it like three or four times and I still actually had that experience
B	yeah
A	and this is sort of me
B	I mean I had
A	and I was doing nothing but work
B	I had a little bit of lifeguarding was the only paid employment I'd had
A	exactly but you still
B	but I
A	yeah but my point being again that she's literally never earned any money in her life which I find quite
B	she
A	she did that  festival thing
B	yeah she did the festival and she did erm she got paid for and she's done open days and stuff that she gets paid for
A	yeah but that's not really
B	no it's certainly different
A	that's actually volunteering and you happen to be paid
B	no
A	erm
B	but
A	which is sort of again just a little bit interesting
B	mm
A	but it's possible to have
B	er yes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	quite weird
B	yeah
A	yeah I know but
B	which was just natural
A	but the fact that the timescale wasn't essentially dealt with
B	yeah
A	er right
B	okay erm can I borrow your
A	er I did used to know it by heart and then put it in the phone and didn't
B	oh right right of course
A	so yeah
B	oh one new message
B	shall I read it?
A	oh shit
B	last night it must have been last night
A	I think if you text him back
B	erm oh hang on I've just closed it
A	no don't bring it back
B	no let's text him back
A	yeah
B	options
A	you just said bring it back
B	I'll bring it back
A	oh
A	just say er hi er just picked it up sorry er had a mental piss-up with my dad last night
B	yeah you're going to have to give me what I saw on his phone
A	so am I actually it's not the most intuitive interface and I'll probably get used to it eventually
B	yeah
A	I'm not used to my new role at all at work which fills me
B	Good
B	just picked it up
A	sorry just picked it up
A	er had a rather mental night
B	piss-up it wasn't in the dictionary
A	not that
B	oh I love the pigs
B	nice
A	no
A	okay I think now we've stopped which is surprising but excellent
B	mm
A	is it taking you that long to write that much?
B	yeah
A	erm er erm er driving at the moment er er brackets
A	erm er er er and then just details details details exclamation mark
B	okay
A	so do you think that should be er
B	yeah
A	hyphen et cetera rather than full stop
B	full stop
A	it shouldn't be a full stop it should be a comma or a hyphen
B	after pick your message up?
A	yeah because that the had a mental rather family had a rather mental family piss-up is explaining the reason
B	alright okay
A	why I've just picked it up
B	comma had a rather
A	you're not very good at this
B	you paused in a full stop kind of way
A	no I didn't
B	hi sorry just picked your message up
A	that's better
B	driving at the moment
A	yeah is that a question mark and exclamation mark?
B	question mark exclamation mark okay?
A	have we managed that simple task?
B	yeah
A	Good
B	okay send?
A	yeah
B	so now I'll ring your grandpa
A	please yes
B	okay erm so we'll be there in about half an hour you reckon?
A	yeah
B	erm hopefully he'll know who I am?
A	just say it's
B	with
A	it's not rocket science
B	I know okay
A	you also forgot to get your iPod out
B	yeah
A	I know it's not critical
B	hello it's Sarah and I'm just letting you know erm
A	for lunch
B	erm
A	bringing lunch
B	and we've got some lunch with us as well
A	Good
B	and I didn't quite catch it but I think I said you know we'll be there in about half an hour
A	yeah
B	but you were talking at the same time so I didn't quite catch but I think he said Oh for lunch? erm which was good so
A	yes
B	I'll put that down there in case they text back
A	because it's easier than getting it back into my pocket
B	yeah
A	so yes
B	yeah erm
A	yeah but
B	yeah but I mean I don't think we need to be back any you know very much earlier than that but apparently erm yeah it's just if erm and it might not be at half four it might be five because they haven't got a timetable
A	well I have one
B	if it's yeah if we  if we  get back by four that should be fine
A	yes
A	yes
B	experience and stuff
A	like I said we'll see how erm we'll see how she's er coped this week
B	yeah I mean I think she'll probably really enjoy it and I mean there's always a question after that of whether you want to do it for your job but I think she'll really enjoy
B	no I was thinking more just yeah having things to do and being in an office and it is quite exciting and I really enjoyed my work experience
A	right
B	they weren't particularly friendly or welcoming or
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but it is quite a good way to do it because you're not at the
B	yeah exactly it does make sense erm
B	but having said that though I mean I wasn't doing anything very critical I was mainly reading erm slush which is a difficult there's so much of it even in an idiot would know it was bad
A	yes but the point is you could have missed something that was actually good
B	yes entirely yeah
A	constantly quite a lot
B	yes I could have done
A	so it was actually quite important
B	yes I think but I think it I was basically flagging up anything that wasn't dreadful erm and I was being you know very careful because
A	okay
B	yeah so that's why I thought it was you know quite a good
A	is he in another country reading another language?
B	no no I think it's Australia
A	okay
B	or New Zealand
A	oh you're not seriously trying to do that are you or are you? Please don't try to do
B	oh my God
A	you fucktard
B	wow
A	so what has that gained you?
B	just incredible
B	mm
A	and they consider themselves good drivers
B	yes because they haven't actually killed anyone
A	yes
B	yes exactly
B	yeah how was
A	ah okay
B	you know and it really it wasn't a case of you know they they didn't ask me for
A	okay
B	everyone else I spoke to when I was introduced to them or when I had to go and get work from them it was no interaction other than that you know
A	okay
B	so you know erm so that would make it better I think and erm yeah it'll be good
A	and declined to be
B	no no she she erm she
B	I think the only thing is we have er like an office PA erm who is very nice called
A	well no because you'd be one member of staff might be down and you have twenty-five per cent of the
B	exactly yeah
B	erm jobs
B	Rugby rugby
A	yes short answer
B	yeah no I don't know this part of the world
B	it is more you know the sort of estate market
B	wow
A	very popular
B	yeah
A	incredible
B	but then if you were living in Sweden though would you feel the need to buy I don't know like a Golf just to be different?
A	no
A	well it's not performance it's
B	buying the best car
A	because they're good
B	I guess so yeah
A	like the Swedes have clearly realised
B	the Swedes are right
B	oh sorry
A	but yes they are
B	that's interesting yeah
A	which is kind of funny
B	Saab are shutting though aren't they?
B	Saab are shutting or they have shut?
A	month ago yeah
B	yeah
A	well done for the
B	I don't follow the car market avidly
A	current affairs
B	no I read it in
B	yeah yeah
A	when one of them shuts it's still fairly big news
B	well definitely I mean I suppose the problem is if I don't look at the BBC website for a few days because I'm busy at lunchtime I end up missing loads of news
A	yes
B	and as it's fairly large news
A	that wasn't me
B	the
A	oh yeah
B	okay
A	paper
B	yeah true actually yeah
A	you won't know what what time they're on
B	no but it'll give us a better idea and I don't know if there's nothing on anywhere in the country that we fancy seeing is there?
A	I mean I have the iPad but the 3G contract
B	it's very short-sighted
A	a full capacity to do that
B	yeah the capacity to get on and say you want it because otherwise it's yeah it's limited in its usefulness I think
A	yes
B	mm
A	no it's not worth the mobile
B	yeah
A	because the hardware would connect you to the signal and it's just a question of
B	yeah whether they'll let you connect to it
A	I'd assume
B	well it's not if you're a trade you can connect to the Wi-Fi in order to log-on
A	well exactly
B	and to pay your money like it seems daft to not have the not be able to do that
A	I think it encourages you to take them out even if you may not need it
B	yeah and maybe that's the thinking yeah sort of erm just thinking
B	does it always say
A	no
B	no
B	God
A	no you can't and that's the thing
B	yeah and the answer was no and I was like oh
B	popular
A	oh yeah they're very popular there's a  there's a  waiting list
B	oh right
A	they're not actually that expensive either
B	oh you're so in love with
A	no I'm not objectively I don't want one myself
B	well who would want a massive? That's quite creepy
A	what's creepy is it's falling over
B	yeah
A	I mean that's a bit of an issue
B	I don't like that that's weird
A	you don't like your
B	that reminds me of the massive marshmallow man in erm Ghostbusters
A	I've never seen that
B	I haven't seen it either but I've seen it's kind of an iconic scene where
A	well the iPod has got a speaker in it
B	has an iPod?
A	yeah the Touches they've got
B	have they? So in fact
A	yes
B	I just can't help thinking that the options of spend seventy pounds spend two hundred pounds and I'm like well yes
A	or just
B	or
A	use your existing one and just learn to use it
B	yeah
A	but no if there's an option to
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	or just trying harder for about five minutes
B	yeah
A	no just dad
B	you really should stop suggesting that he buys a laptop
A	I'm I'm kind of teasing him
B	I know but the thing is he'll get the idea in his head and he'll buy a laptop and your mum will be so annoyed
A	I've had the idea in my head for ages but I did I have actually been in touch with him and we did this when we were at the final stage of when we were just buying a kettle I think
B	right
A	and you know to buy that specific one which was quite an effort
B	it's very nice
A	but you know the issue was that so we were in this erm as I say he was looking at laptops in Dixons or
B	no exactly
A	stop it
B	I don't think he likes the idea of her using it sort of wrongly
A	yeah
B	exactly yeah
A	I think I'm too old to
B	oh that's the thing they're lovely
A	and there's no reason that
B	yeah that's a permanent thing then
A	oh okay
B	it's been there the last couple of times we've been down and I think it must just be parked there as an advert
A	but occasionally move it just so as to
B	yeah exactly
A	even if one of the colleges was trying to get it removed and the ulterior for that is
B	oh I'm sure they have
A	just
B	no well that's the weird thing it's just part of it
A	no I once bought something for my first year
B	yeah I bought a kind of Fanta from there and then looked at it and it was erm it had a writing on it I didn't recognise the alphabet and I and it was a brighter colour orange than I'd seen Fanta before and I thought I'm not sure I should be really very sure what to drink this
A	yes
B	because like it erm it looked a bit like Fanta in Swaziland which language has chemicals in it which are banned in England
A	but you drank it there?
B	I drank it there yeah
A	and look what it did to you
B	exactly
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	but I was er
B	shit
A	and I said hah alright that's why the porters must be pissed off
B	oh dear-y me
A	it's like because we don't think of the college as an employer but of course it is
B	it is yeah
A	it's kind of a big employer
B	yeah exactly
A	it must employ fifty people and
B	and yeah you've got
B	yes
A	yeah it is interesting and it worked out that the full cost of us educating an average Cambridge student is about eighteen thousand pounds
B	yeah
A	well you are but
B	well you are but it's it depends how you look at it really
A	well
B	yes
A	in itself
B	yes
A	well it's just
B	yeah it needs to examine
A	essentially the entire thing is giving a wage out
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	so it's not
B	no
A	so for example if you're an art student and you don't want a long walk you should apply to
B	yes
A	if you want to er if you're going to do astronomy at
B	well I I think yeah
B	if you hate social contact apply
A	if you you know if you wanted to go to a big ball every year apply to
A	yeah
B	and like it should be made clearer that there's differences and
A	some colleges
B	in terms of financial support in gyms exactly facilities
B	yeah
A	what?
B	yeah you can get book grants at the colleges
A	wow
B	which colleges can give their students however much a year towards books? You know it's unheard of at
A	but we should also make it very clear that if you go into a central college you will spend most of your time living off site
B	yes exactly
A	and
B	there's so many differences
A	and you won't get accommodation in the fourth year if you're on a four-year course
B	yeah
A	in which
B	I entirely agree yeah it's
A	and access doesn't do that because it would actually then it would seem to apply and the college's decision is important
B	yeah it is evidently it is
A	reducing stress
B	and exactly reducing the stress and the amount of
A	but you you know if you're savvy you'll look at the public school ratios
B	yeah
A	it's useless
B	it's yeah if it's not helpful in terms of getting that inside look erm
A	but the thing on
B	it's ridiculous
A	there's a couple of like a couple of like so which college has a decent gym? But that
B	yeah that's quite a privilege
A	but but that's not actually helping people
B	no
A	disadvantaged students get even a more even footing
B	none of it has been erm I'm applying for English I have no English teacher at my school can you tell me a little bit about what the interview is going to be like so I can compare
B	it it's not about that it's being like
A	it's just trivia
B	yes it's trivia it's a lot of it isn't from people in this country
A	yeah which isn't what it's designed for
B	it's not what it's
A	when it's badly written and
B	and some of it's just for people who think well you don't need to know that
A	well I think one was what's the best motorway route from
B	yeah
A	and I think I'm
B	yeah nice
A	who gives a shit?
B	it's stupid
A	you know look on Google apps
B	yeah well exactly it's it's not TAZ's job to field questions like that
A	more to the point
B	erm what can I do about
A	she should be making sure she's getting questions like that and she's not
B	no
A	she's getting questions yeah but not the right sort of questions
B	well with the whole service is being kind of advertised and sort of made available how who knows about it you know? It's a good service and
A	but if you Google
B	yeah
A	but how many people know to Google
B	yeah yeah
A	you know I'm sure she's doing lots of initiatives but how many of those are actually doing
B	they're targeting the right people I guess because yeah this is just it's stupid it's not
B	schools
A	and the education a child receives
B	and and the
A	but that's not what we're doing and that's
B	no
B	yes yeah
A	that's really weird because that sign
B	mm
A	the round circle with a red outline means no vehicular access
B	which is wrong
A	which is very very bizarre and they really should get that fixed
B	yeah
A	no it it was in the thirties but worn off
B	yeah
A	but that current technically if you obey that road sign as read you'd stop
B	yes you'd stop
A	yeah that's what I thought
B	but no I agree I think erm the the the access is kind of it's so small scale and talking to individual students and I'm not sure
A	that's just a piss take
B	of you need to change
A	yeah it looks good but it's doing fuck all
B	I mean I think yes it might make a difference in if one pupil from a disadvantaged school is involved in some kind of access or target scheme and goals and then they go back to their old school and say apply it's for the likes of us
A	yes but that's different that that's giving them
B	yeah
A	they've already thought about it
B	I guess so yeah
A	a bit but that's not the people it should be targeting
B	it's for people who the schools have seen oh you don't want to go to
A	yeah exactly but that again is a very small portion of the problem because fundamentally there isn't a problem and that's why you commented and I think
B	well yeah I mean that's the thing
A	but
B	and I mean the media are really up in arms and it's like well actually
A	you know
B	it really does it's incredibly
A	it's far better than the American system and the fact that really annoys me is The Times is writing it so it boosted
B	mm
A	and like that's why I've got two problems with that
B	yeah
B	and and your academic context if you can interact in an academic setting
A	yeah but it doesn't matter
B	and that's all that matters surely? Obviously if you can't interact in an academic setting that's different
A	yes
B	if you were a genius but you can't express it that's no good
A	so but you know
A	that is  that is  almost relevant
B	yeah
A	you know you shouldn't get be a
B	yes
A	there's no other relevance to that
B	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	I like
A	yeah but he was asked at the end of his talk that we had
B	yeah
A	erm er er a guy out of of
B	wow
A	asked that question and the answer was no sir
B	well yeah my response would have been if you would like to donate a million pounds the department we would be extremely grateful it will not have any relevance at all to your daughter's application but please a million pounds is great thanks very much
A	but the thing that was that at Harvard that would make a difference
B	it would yes that's
A	that would make a huge difference
B	I think that's the problem if you can take
A	and the fact that there's a sliding scale so if you can pay the interest
B	yeah if you can pay you're in and if you can't pay you've got to be quite good
A	yeah and it wouldn't
B	and that doesn't seem right
A	and it's actually saying and the BBC was actually saying yeah this is a good system
B	yeah
A	how possibly? And you're judging
A	of being elitist
B	yeah I'm sorry
A	fuck off
B	you you know yes there's still a kind of a
A	there'll always be a higher ratio of people from public schools because oddly enough two reasons firstly public schools are selective
B	well I was just going to say that if you've been taught well and properly for your entire school career in small classes
A	of course you're going
B	you're probably more confident and more and and talk better
A	well no just leaving that aside assuming the standard of teaching was the same which it is obviously because people pay
B	yeah exactly
A	so if you wanted to you know the only meaningful comparison would be between
B	yeah
A	that would be a meaningful thing and anywhere with selective entry
B	because
A	rather than you know if this is
B	I think selective entry free and selective entry appealing is an interesting
A	A lot of state schools you know are getting what two million and in some cases as low as twenty per cent of people getting five As and A stars and Cs
B	well yeah
A	yeah so that's an eighty per cent of people who just you know unless
B	they can't do it
B	yeah
A	because just to get you
B	exactly
A	and you just you'd just be an incredible ignorance of people and the media playing up to people
B	well I know but most people think that selecting people for academic students on the basis of academic ability is elitist
A	yes
B	an elitism in a negative sense not in a sense of any
A	yeah
B	people don't think about it like this like
A	but that's because most people are very stupid
B	I think it's because university hasn't is is stopped to be synonymous with academia
A	yes
B	there's a  there's a  yeah there's a disconnection exactly
A	sorry can I just finish off what I was saying back then?
B	yes
B	yeah
A	it's just
B	I agree with that yeah your ability
A	as are every other personality character
B	yeah I was going to say all everything is genetic like your ability in sports
B	is partially determined by their genes
A	but it's unacceptable to say that you know
B	yeah but you can't say
A	both parents have got an IQ of point six you're not going to produce a child who is
B	but mind you with genetics
A	no it won't it's almost I'd say that's pretty much an impossibility er and
B	excellent
A	that's fine
B	if your parents don't want you to go to school you're probably not going to go to Cambridge are you?
A	well no if you  if you  don't value education you won't accept it and that's another problem with the whole system is that you can't force an education on someone
B	well I think you can I think the problem is I think you can achieve in life if you're in that situation
A	I'll tell  you why
B	if if you then refused to take part in anything that's a different matter but I don't think it's a case of saying you won't so I'm not going to bother to teach
A	yeah but you can't you
B	I think it's it's you said okay both parents are from a council estate and it's pointless spending money on your own education because you're not going to achieve anything and that's obviously
A	well no but that's not what's done
B	no
A	by anyone
