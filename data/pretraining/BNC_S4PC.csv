A	so can you explain to me what is the fifty P tax rate?
B	the fifty P tax rate was instituted I think by the Labour government erm to tax people earning over a hundred and fifty thousand a year
A	so what that means they get? Why is called the fifty P tax rate?
B	because they pay fifty P on every pound taxed
A	do they have a limit tax free first? So they can
B	yes so
A	where's the logic in that?
B	it makes sense
A	so why won't they? Why if it's taxable they don't deduct tax from it?
B	because it's an interesting question
A	and how does one sort out one's tax in this country?
B	it depends on how you're getting your income
A	mm mm
B	erm if you are self employed it is then your responsibility to estimate in advance how much income you're going to have and calculate from that how much tax you're going to be due to pay and to make payments on account
A	okay and if you are employed by a company and you're paid a wage do you still have to declare your taxes every year? Or do some kind of form filling?
B	the
A	tax return
B	if you have
A	mm
B	and your expected to estimate ahead and make payments on account
A	erm if you're earning like twenty grand
B	mm
A	apart from
B	yeah
A	how many pence in the pound will you be paying?
B	you you'd be paying
A	er that's not to bad
B	yeah
A	and if you're three thirty thousand?
B	then you would still only pay at twenty percent
A	oh okay
B	erm
A	that's a big jump though isn't it
B	once you're earning
A	so once you're earning forty-four thousand forty-two
B	I can't give you the specific amount I'm working from memory but in general
A	okay but  do you mean  do you mean on top of the eight thousand tax free?
B	yes
A	oh so you would have to be earning forty-two thousand a year to
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	and you pay tax at forty percent on your earnings above that so you still pay tax on your basic amount less after your free pay at twenty percent
A	huh? What? What's free pay?
B	the tax free allowance
A	uh-huh
B	it's also called free pay
B	no
A	oh so that so for example
B	so every everything up to thirty-four thousand you'd pay twenty percent
A	ah okay
B	you don't suddenly go on to paying everything at forty percent
A	oh right that's what I thought was the deal
B	mm
A	and does that work
B	without having specific figures I couldn't describe it
A	but does that tax code work it out for the future or for the
B	it works it out
A	mm mm
B	in other words it will work within a tax year
A	hmm
B	as long as you stay within the bounds
A	hmm
B	mm mm
A	is that something that is generated from some kind of form that you have to fill in?
B	not always
A	mm mm
B	normally the tax rebates come because the Inland Revenue calculate your tax at the end of the year from a tax return and find that you have paid more because they had estimated you would pay more and your tax code was set higher
A	hmm
B	paying higher rate tax
A	and is that the end of the calendar year or financial?
B	no the end of the tax year which ends on the fifth of April each year
A	right
B	it's not like some well there are loads of countries that do work their tax year to match the calendar year
A	hmm
B	if
A	mm mm
B	and that would give you a clue as to whether you in fact had over or under paid
A	hmm
B	so it's always wise to keep an eye on your tax and make sure that you're paying roughly the right amount of tax
A	yeah
B	mm
A	hmm
B	erm I know it was reduced substantially and there may be some small element erm but I don't know
A	so does that mean that the amount that you're paying into your pension gets it does that that amount doesn't get taxed?
B	correct
A	right
B	it gets taxed when they pay you your pension
B	yes but that's
A	why?
B	erm mainly because I think she didn't fully understand it
A	ah
B	and just thought it was unfair
A	why was she paying? Why was she not happy with what she was paying?
B	she just thought it was not right that as a widow and doing a a job and earning a relatively small amount that she shouldn't be paying tax on it
A	but was it? I mean was
B	we're all in the same boat
A	but she still got her tax free sum and then  and then  I imagine that the tax that she paid was calculated in the band of her earnings no?
B	oh yes
A	so why did she feel it was unfair?
B	erm
A	just because she was a widow
B	there was never a completely logical reason for it just like there is never a completely logical for your mother gets upset about it so
A	oh
B	that's right yes
A	mm
B	erm they're now trying to restrict child allowance to families earning less than the twenty percent tax rate entitles you to
A	well I agree
B	so saying that anybody who was paying tax at forty percent should not have
A	so  anyone earning  anyone earning over forty-two grand say
B	yeah
A	uh-huh
B	mm
A	hmm
B	most of the time it was an advantage for people to be taxed as individuals but if they're deciding to tax or limit child allowance to those paying the lower rate of tax then the couples ought to be able to use their individual free pay
A	hmm
B	you know tax free allowance
A	yeah
B	so it makes sense
A	mm
B	if they are able to use their tax free allowance even if they're not working
A	complicated running a country isn't it?
B	yes
A	and what do you think about the fifty odd abolition of the fifty percent ie the fifty P tax?
B	I I I do not believe that paying ten P a pound more in tax
A	mm
B	I don't believe that is sufficient motivation to make people make those decisions so I think the arguments about it are spurious
A	mm
B	yes
A	hmm
B	I I think it is an unnecessary argument and it's been made into a political argument but it's not
A	it's quite heavy though having to pay half of your income
B	there were people paying in excess of eighty percent of their income of tax in the days when I first started work
A	blimey
B	yeah
A	you're just a slave then
B	ah well I'd cut that
A	and what do you think about the other measures that they're erm allowing more tax free chunks of money for?
B	I I agree with erm improving increasing the tax free allowance at the lower rate
A	but shouldn't everybody just pay fifteen percent of their earnings in tax?
B	mm
A	isn't that fair?
B	we we are in a welfare state and the money has to come for the welfare state
A	true
B	erm so I agree with the lower level incomes being taxed at a lower rate and people who are earning more being taxed at a high rate
A	yeah
B	erm at one time I had some sympathy for the view that everybody who worked to their maximum ability whether they were sweeping the road or running a business should earn the same
A	you little Communist
B	yes
A	yeah if you say that there should be a reward for ability that kind of goes against what you said earlier because it you know people aren't born
B	there should be
A	mm mm
B	but it it has got totally out of proportion
A	yeah
B	yeah I I think that a a bonus of fifteen percent of anybody's salary is a perfectly adequate erm motivating reward
A	hmm
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	erm
A	what had he given you a a rise?
B	A much lower rise than I believed was merited and I believed was reflected in what others on the same sort of level and the same sort of responsibility were getting
A	hmm mm
B	and I made it very clear that I thought it was personal
B	erm but I I didn't erm having made that objection I then sort of just carried on as normal
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I mean for example scientists and people who have a passion for a certain field will get their you know their recompense at their how do you say it? Their erm
B	mm
A	their yeah
B	yeah
A	and I don't think money there is so much of a of an incentive
B	but I I think there are I I think in in each of those categories you've described and in the rest of the categories of people you will find there are those who enjoy their job and who work well because they enjoy it
A	but maybe what I am saying is that maybe a lot of the cutting edge things that we've got
B	I  I would  I would be very interested if it was possible to get statistics on that
A	mm
B	I I would believe that a higher proportion would come from those who were motivated by the search rather than by what they were being paid for the search
A	but a lot of people would be doing it to be paid the money
B	erm even if you look at entrepreneurs erm starting businesses  I don't  I don't think many of them would be motivated by just being able to earn unlimited amounts of money based on the success of their venture
A	hmm
B	hmm
A	hmm
B	the more they learn the more they see the opportunities of doing more things
A	hmm
B	is this a convenient point to pause? How many have we done?
A	yeah just a little bit more
B	mm
A	erm so yeah it was more important to get a job that you enjoy than one that you that pays a lot of money
B	er lot depends on where you're living and how much you can get your basic accommodation for
A	hmm
B	erm
A	and as a single person to be able to afford a house and a car and a holiday once a year?
B	oh
A	fifty thousand? Are you joking?
B	well single people have a much more expensive lifestyle than couples
B	erm I
A	hmm
B	erm
A	and do you imagine that you'll be spending a third of that on your accommodation? Because obviously in some areas accommodation is a lot more expensive than that?
B	yeah yeah obviously
A	hmm
B	erm holidays you can have economic and be expensive
B	it it's very difficult to say what is an acceptable living wage
A	hmm
