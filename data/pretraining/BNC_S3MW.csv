A	but she has pointed out he can't afford it
A	yeah and she said well it'd be nice if he came
B	yeah oh god
A	she says and it'll be better to have two because otherwise you're paying a single supplement
B	yeah
A	well even a single supplement's cheaper than taking
B	crikey
A	paying and it's about
B	I was gonna say it's not gonna be
A	no I mean she does alright with her business these days thankfully I mean she and she deserves it because she's the only one who's earnt the money in that house

B	well she
A	was all that they hang on to

A	oh did she?
B	yeah
A	oh she didn't tell me that
A	oh
B	yeah?
A	a lot of the elephants didn't want to go in
B	yeah
A	and hers didn't so she said to the trainer oh don't make him don't make him we don't mind
B	yeah
A	he said alright then and then he was happy then the elephant when he could walk away so he went somewhere else
A	he carried on
B	yeah
A	she said they saw some of the elephants who are happy once they're in there but they were being made to go in cos it was part of the
B	yeah
A	part of the trip I suppose
B	sounded nice where they were anyway
A	yes
B	yeah
A	what was the one on today about
A	see if they can get rid of all those horrible marks she's got from wearing ridiculous heels for
B	mm
A	goodness knows how long

A	yes they're not too bad though now
B	go on?
A	that she had to put insect repellent but then they went for a massage on their legs and feet and it all came off and they didn't bother reapplying
B	ah
A	so they both got bitten all over their legs that night
B	mm
A	I said well er it just shows it's working if you put it on
B	oh is it? oh okay
A	cos it's half six in the morning

A	half six till half eight
B	they're just sleeping now
A	with erm
B	she's thinking she might not get any
A	oh I suppose ten o'clock now is it yeah? yeah she'll've probably gone to bed
B	mm
A	yeah
B	is it a
A	this is the one yeah that's kind of on a
B	kind of thing
A	yeah where some man his wife
B	yeah she told me about that
A	erm this one says it's good if you like walking
A	erm
B	oh
B	I thought it was a
A	er it's
B	mm
A	and then this is called the
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm
A	and they said this is the one they're gonna do the boat trip from
B	yeah
A	but they've gotta watch out cos the monkeys are quite dangerous on these islands so they need to
B	mm yeah yeah
A	they need to be careful
B	mm
A	I know I keep saying to
B	oh okay Thai in Thailand
B	oh dear
A	yeah we having Thai tonight
B	mm
A	they very rarely spend a day together cos they're always working
B	yeah I know well he seems to spend most of the time when they're just
A	yes he does yeah
B	it looks very nice
A	yeah it does doesn't it?
B	mm
A	got a swimming pool and everything there
B	yeah yeah
A	beach and the
B	yeah
A	very very much how I remember Thailand that sort of scenery there
B	mm
A	yes
B	not
A	doesn't appeal to you?
B	well I'll just get bitten won't I?
B	doesn't work
A	oh yeah probably down there yeah
B	and I got absolutely
A	eaten alive
A	maybe we need a different type for you mind you if we get that
B	oh yeah
A	no I know but at least that was really good at bringing them down wasn't it?
B	yeah but it's
A	everybody's sold on that in
B	mm
A	it's gone like massive everybody has it
B	steroids
A	yeah it's probably banned over here
A	probably contains too many strong ingredients but it worked anyway
B	it's fine
A	you haven't got any more
B	at the moment
A	cream?
A	I was in Boots
A	oh I see you're doing more with that
B	mm
A	I though oh I'll see if they've got any thermometers like the little stick ones we used to have
B	oh yeah?
A	they're all dead expensive state of the art
B	that's what I thought yeah
A	thirty quid
B	yeah
A	I
B	cos I had a look in Asda and
A	what happened to the little stick things we used to just put under your arm and it just had a reading on it?
B	no idea
A	these ones I'm I didn't even see
B	like digital ones
A	yeah I didn't read how it worked because the the print was too small I couldn't read it
B	mm
A	but I don't know if you this is even the non-contact I don't know if you'd have to touch the baby or just do something
B	oh are they like? cos what do they do?
A	is that what it is?
B	yeah no in Asda it was like forty quid for one and I'm thinking well I'm not getting one of those yeah
A	and it's just instant to? yeah well you can just tell if they're hot I think can't you?
B	mm
A	I couldn't believe I well I just assume you can still get the stuff that we had like I say it was a little stick
B	I haven't seen them
A	and you put it under your arm and you waited for it to beep which probably took about thirty seconds to a minute
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and then when it beeped
B	mm
A	no I thought that was ridiculous
B	mm okay
A	that's cheaper any more cos I was amazed I wonder if
B	don't know
A	might go online and see
B	yeah that's great
A	is by the door
B	put it out
A	yeah and?
B	I might get him to do hopscotch and
A	oh right
A	oh I see
A	have you got a plan for today then?
B	em yeah-ish
A	have you got a test again or not?
B	no not a test no
A	and they're both doing it together with you?
B	yeah
A	yes two and four so how how old does that make them?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	well for her year
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	but does she want you to concentrate on the older one? is that really who she wants
B	yeah
A	the help for?
B	she just wants the younger one to sit in so
A	right
B	I won't worry
A	like a babysitting service
B	yeah I won't worry too much
A	yeah
B	thermometers on Amazon
A	oh right
B	they're about
A	there must be different varieties you can get which are more
B	yeah
A	basic
B	they've got the ear ones and the
A	cos it's not like
B	forehead
A	oh yeah it's not like you probably need to use it very often so I can't see the point in investing all that money
B	mm
A	what have they got?
B	mm mm
A	that's the sort of thing I had
B	yeah think so
B	yeah
A	but that was the erm
B	mm
A	how much are they?
B	four quid
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah if they'd've had something like that in Boots I'd have erm
A	I'd've just got it because
B	yeah I'll order one of those
A	does it say you just hold it into their
B	it doesn't say on this one but
A	doesn't say on there mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	when it was done mm
A	that's fine
B	oh yeah
A	as it got
B	mm mm
A	so
B	yeah

B	really quickly?
A	really quickly and yet they were given equal
B	doesn't really make
A	no
B	annoying
A	mm
B	oh okay
A	I think we have to erm
B	when is this next exam?

B	lots of people with babies
B	yeah till yeah it was from
A	do they do
A	do you have to pay to hire things individually or just pay your membership fee?
B	so you pay five pound for the year and then it's one pound every time you wanna take something out

B	mm yes
A	she was panicking over that cos
B	that wouldn't be fun by yourself would it?
A	well not when we had to stop over in Dubai but she'd've been fine because I mean she's business class and they were

A	and you can understand it but
B	mm
A	we never got any compensation it doesn't er
B	travelling

B	mm
