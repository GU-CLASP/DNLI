A	drop off
A	so how long did it take you to learn how to drive and be confident knowing that what you were doing was coming automatically and?
B	mm
A	nineteen?
B	but
A	but did you have practice at?
B	but that was because I failed four
A	no you see I'm thinking of having at least twenty
B	mm
A	did you?
B	yeah my
A	ah
B	so that was quite quite good
A	what you drove?
B	yeah but me and my dad had loads of arguments
B	he was teaching me to drive
A	how many times did you take your test?
B	five
A	mm
B	on my test
A	mm
B	the next one is
A	you feel the pressure's on and
B	yeah
A	but did you feel quite confident when you were actually driving without the
B	yeah
A	in the lesson and stuff?
B	mhm
A	really?
B	I'm the same with exams and that
A	mm
B	I get really stressed
A	oh no
B	mm
A	absolutely lovely
B	I like things like that
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	gorgeous
B	mm
A	and did you start driving straight away after your test? Did you have a car?
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	and then I just yep I drove
B	so he took me
A	that's a good idea
B	yeah I felt confident before I even passed because I knew that I could drive
A	mhm
B	and my driving instructor was really nice
A	oh no
B	mm
A	control my nerves a lot better but
B	I still do for interviews
A	mm
B	that's one thing I hate
A	mm
B	you've really gotta
A	I know what you mean
B	mm
A	write the application form and
B	especially for a good job
A	hm
B	if I'm being like honest I want something you know over twenty really
A	definitely
B	if I'm going back full time and paying for nursery fees
A	yeah
B	I don't  I don't  want less
A	are you still thinking about doing a PGCE primary?
B	at the moment no
A	hm
B	no
A	he's too little
B	yeah
B	it'd be good but um it's like about fifteen thousand
A	I've seen some that pay up to eighteen
B	have you?
A	mm
B	mm
A	and you don't have to plan or anything
B	this is true
A	mhm
B	that'd be great
A	yeah but I know what you mean
B	it's not really
A	you can't afford to to live pay rent let alone saving for a mortgage on anything below that
B	yeah exactly
A	mm
B	I've had sexism
A	really?
B	I had one Iranian guy do not sit me next to that nigger
A	oh no
B	mm
A	sat him next to it
B	between the two
A	ah
B	guys from Africa
A	how did he cope?
B	he didn't say anything
A	did he get on with them?
B	yeah he was fine after that
A	I was surprised how racist the Chinese students were against Indian people
B	oh yeah
A	I mean really really surprised
B	yeah and I find if the Chinese girl were to have a a black boyfriend they would be you know ashamed the family be very
A	what a shame
B	mhm
A	and even like things like project management
B	definitely
A	over the course of the  of the  the academic year or how long the course runs for
B	mm
A	mm
B	I had one class of they were all  they were all  Muslim men but they were from
A	uh-huh
B	and um
A	I've only ever seen it written down
B	well I think yeah Eritrea
B	and it really it just started into a big argument between everyone in the class because
A	did it generate a lot of English though?
B	it did yeah
A	perfect
B	no it was great
A	mhm
B	but the other guys was like Eritrean Iranian guy from Yemen um Iranian guy
A	mhm
B	so
A	that was their only common language
B	but it
A	I can imagine
B	like cos the
A	really?
B	the other guys were like
A	oh good
B	oh right
A	are very religious Catholic order I think
A	and they were all going on a march in Madrid that weekend
B	mhm
A	against gay marriage
B	mhm
A	and there was a a girl in class who was a lesbian
B	yeah
A	you know a really open issue
B	the class did?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like her three friends against this girl
B	mm
A	into having this opinion
B	yeah
A	but I just took a bit of a backseat and just let them debate it because I I thought it was important for this Opus Dei girl to realize that her beliefs were unfounded
B	yeah
A	and that you know kind of a jury of her peers was
A	that her beliefs were unfounded
B	mhm
A	just blindly follow something that someone else is telling her to do
B	it's it's so a shame like especially people who are from countries that um like in Somalia they're they are mainly Muslim but a lot of them have never read the Quran and they believe what they're told by their imams
A	right so it's
B	like a dog
A	his interpretation
B	is a dirty animal that you can't have a dog
B	and he would be damned because it's you know it's the Quran and you should never do it anyway
A	didn't you offer to try yourself?
B	I was tempted to but I thought no I'm gonna get in trouble if I took it too far
A	and how they don't then question it when they
B	yeah
A	I just wondered whether there might be too many brightness coming through for him
B	to keep him to make him sleep
A	no whether it was er disturbing him
B	he likes things over his face
A	shall I leave it there?
B	I don't yeah I think he's alright actually
A	shall I uncover his mouth a bit though?
A	yeah but also set up the situation in which there can be dialogue between people who've got different opinions
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	my
A	uh-huh
B	especially in banks and that
A	mm
B	have to know all the er lingo
A	mhm
B	you know like all these transferable skills and
A	I suppose all the stakeholders as much as possible la la la la la
B	I'm actually gonna help her have a go at my
A	let's do some more
B	it's gotta be eaten today
A	yes well if it has to be eaten today we should really eat it today shouldn't we
B	we must
A	mm
B	it is
A	be really filling but
B	shall I just scoop it out?
A	go for it
B	I'd scoop yours but I've eaten from mine
A	Don't worry
B	um
A	yep
B	I can  help them
A	mhm
B	objectively at it
A	no it's good to show
B	mm
A	to get good advice from as many people as as possible
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	different kinds of jobs
A	we've got planning skills
B	mhm
A	prioritizing
B	mhm
A	and if you say this
B	mm
A	oh
B	I found this really good website
A	mhm
B	um like er things like problem solving
A	mm
B	and when I wrote my CV I found it quite difficult to to name my skills
A	yeah
B	I just never had never thought about it in in that way
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it's just making myself sit down and do it really
B	hm
A	it's the thought of I think it's the whole job-hunting thing really that's putting me off looking at my CV and looking at stuff
B	just sounded like  sounded like  he said his daddy's name then
B	he's quite cheeky
A	that sounded quite odd
B	he's loving that
A	I wonder  I wonder  whether we'll have a good summer this year
B	mm
A	then he can play in the garden
B	mm
A	ah
B	I think he's okay
A	oop
A	do you want to see mummy? Let's turn you round so you can see mummy
A	ah that smile
B	I do it's you I think he really likes you
A	the feeling's mutual
A	he can see both of us then
A	can't you? Yeah
B	mm
A	so has your sister already started applying for jobs or?
B	er yeah
A	mhm
B	to hear back
A	yeah I think most places that've got human resources departments
B	mm
A	they usually advertise the job for about a month
B	mm
A	before the closing date
B	but this was
A	really?
B	and the closing date was April
A	that is forward planning
B	mhm
A	isn't it
B	I think it's that job I said about
A	oh okay
B	oh
A	mm
B	edexcel
A	mm
B	edexcel
A	well maybe you should check out um the different exam boards' websites and see if there's any others that have got
B	mhm
A	something
B	mm
A	yep
B	so I really would like to not be starting a new job when they come
A	my you wolfed that down quickly
B	that's my excuse
B	ah you're ever so tired aren't you
A	are you thinking of having another one?
B	yeah
A	aw
B	she's more interested in her friends and that now
A	would you  would you  like to wait and have another one or?
B	no
A	or have one
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	I I don't want to be
A	yeah
B	anyway um
A	oh dear
B	oh dear
A	sleepy sleepy
B	Samsung
A	yeah?
B	mhm
A	well this was the cheapest one on the market
B	and the thing is the the batteries go so quickly in it
A	they do
B	you have to recharge
A	mm
B	them like every day where I used to like couple of days you could use it without charging it
A	well my other phone you know this one
B	mm
A	my brick from the nineteen seventies I'd like charge it up once a week?
A	Cos I'd only ever use it for text messaging and receiving some calls
B	but those are better than the iPhones
A	I can't get with the whole i phenomenon
B	mm
A	it I had iTunes
B	mm
A	was just so it just wasn't logical
A	and it really annoyed me that you couldn't just use it as a like a hard disk external disk drive
B	yeah
A	and just you know copy and paste over digital music tracks
B	mm
A	Cos I had to
B	oh yeah
A	into
B	yeah things like that drive me insane
A	but I've heard that the iPhone is similar
B	it has to be like from Apple doesn't it more or less and a way for them to make more money
A	hm
B	Cos unless you get it from the Apple Store or whatever then like you say you have to convert the things and do you have to pay to do
A	I don't know
B	hm
A	it costs you in time
B	yeah
B	who the hell is this guy?
A	I will exterminate
A	I am an Android phone
B	and you have to go to the Android Market and I was just what?
B	what's an Android Market? Where's the Android Market?
A	were you picturing the
B	yeah
A	little green men
B	oh so okay
B	is it a shop you have to go to?
B	mm
A	for telephones don't they
B	yours is Android isn't it
A	yeah
B	all of
A	he
B	all of them are
A	he offered me a choice between Android and Symbian
B	I hadn't heard Symbian
A	I think it's just a different operating system
B	oh
A	I think Nokia phones work a lot with it
B	mm
A	but um I have no idea pff no idea
B	mm
A	oh look the Android
B	yay
A	but then again I can you know I've got all these fancy functions but to find really
B	mm
A	er call log see who you've your missed calls are from
B	oh I've got the call log from when I first had the phone and I don't know how to you know can delete in sometimes
A	mm
B	saved as draft
A	what kind of phone is yours?
B	it's a HTC
A	who have you contracted? Who have you?
B	oh Orange
A	yeah I've got Orange too
B	yeah
A	it's saved somewhere
B	yeah
A	I can't work out how to stop a call
B	mm
A	the um screensaver comes in and it's just black
B	mhm
A	and so when I finish the call
B	mhm
A	the screen is black
B	mhm
A	and it's just the main menu and there's nothing there about ending
B	can you just press
A	the call
B	the screen
A	I don't know but like
B	yeah I think you just touch the screen
A	when you phone someone and they've got answerphone on and you leave a message
B	mm
A	and they can't put the phone down
B	if you just touch the screen
A	then
B	and then it should come up like
A	really?
B	and
A	aha
B	two minutes and he's gone
A	aw
B	I knew he would but
A	oh
B	determined not desperate
B	to do it like that
B	mm
A	that's probably important
B	mm yeah
A	is there something in breast milk that's like a
B	apparently when you breastfeed you release hormones that er make it easier for you to fall back to fall asleep
A	oh right
B	I don't know if that's passed on to him
A	aha
B	but for him it um breastfeeding is just very relaxing for him and makes him feel safe
A	mm
B	so he feels safe to be able to fall asleep
A	mhm
B	and um it lowers the heartbeat
A	mhm
B	so it's a wonderful thing
B	but I think bottle er does the same
A	mm
B	they get the same feeling
A	mm
B	but then they can use a dummy
A	yeah
B	so
A	and he's out like a light
B	yeah
B	and as heavy as
A	really?
B	actually I need to weigh him to find out
A	mhm
B	so if you're worried
A	mhm
B	so you can just go they'll check and make they
A	mhm
B	and he'll on the larger side
A	aw
B	mm
A	Cos you were huge when you were pregnant weren't you
B	now I know why
A	er I wish I'd married a smaller man
B	Cos I'd say usually like the baby is doesn't usually get um even if you're a smaller person then usually the baby won't grow above a certain weight cos it's you know it's
A	mhm
B	too to be able to to come out
A	the door's not big enough
B	mm
B	maybe I'll have a nice little girl next
A	yeah
B	just like her mum
A	make her little
B	yeah
A	big brother
B	are your brothers older or younger than you?
A	three years older
B	do are you close?
A	um
B	yeah
A	banter
B	yeah
A	we're not close but um
B	I think that with my brother and sister we definitely have the same sense of humour
A	uh-huh
B	they get you more than than other
A	yeah
B	kinda like say things and it's just
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I'm the
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	I'm the youngest
B	one brother and one sister
A	ah
B	my sister's the middle one and my brother's the youngest
A	is he? Oh my brother was a tyrant when I was growing up
B	was he?
A	that's why I was thinking don't turn into a bully
A	Australia
B	do you think you would be close closer emotionally if he lived closer or you just think
A	um
B	it would be the same?
A	probably we'd probably see each other more
B	yeah
A	er
B	he wasn't
A	he wasn't my brother
B	I wouldn't be friends with my brother
A	we're completely different
B	mm
A	and more I'm more placid and more peace-loving
B	ah okay
A	he's a he always provokes arguments and
