A	ah it the FA Cup is on Saturday
B	right
A	I think it's on Sunday
B	okay
A	but
B	right
A	tonight it another not quite so interesting but fairly interesting final which is Sevilla Sevilla
B	yes
A	against Dnipro
B	oh yes that's the er Europa Cup
A	yeah
B	isn't it and the winner gets a
A	shot into
B	in the championship
A	yeah yeah
B	yes well that's a good idea
A	that might be worth watching they're good Sevilla
B	mm I felt a little bit sorry for Hull
B	at the weekend it was
A	yes yes that's right
B	and what doomed them losing to Birmingham
A	that's right
B	wasn't it? er a week
A	that's right
B	or so before
A	that's right that's right that's right
B	mm mm
A	I mean some clubs you've you do feel charitable towards to sympathetic towards to
B	yes yeah
A	some you don't and you think you know if they
B	yeah yeah
A	as that you know
B	it's
A	preferably with people being sent off
A	and all the rest of it that's right
B	yes or well er without anyone getting harmed but
A	no not harmed
B	the ground being destroyed as well you know
A	no exactly yes
B	no no no
A	that would be too much
B	when everybody's gone you know and there's sort of a ray coming down from above
B	sort of flatten the place
B	yes
A	that's right
B	mm yes I I my heart does not go out to er Chelsea's or
A	he's a swine isn't he?
B	mm
A	no there are some insufferable people aren't there he's just one of them
B	yes
A	er which well
B	yeah
A	people divide on this one which side are you on this one?
B	I'm I'm glad he's not being picked I I I think
A	right
B	or you know the collegiality
A	yes right
B	and and he's a destroyer of it erm
A	true
B	sometimes you have to put up with but erm I think in his case he's past his best
A	oh that's a different kettle
B	you know
A	kettle of fish
B	uhu
A	who
B	mm
B	he's a good chap isn't he?
A	and er a good chap that's right yeah
B	farming stock you know
A	farming stock yeah
B	or or at least his people are
B	and I think he married into farming stock
A	that's right as well
B	he he likes being down on the farm now
A	and he's a hunt and fish and shooting kind as well is he well
B	he's a decent chap you know he's well well educated
A	right
B	one of us
A	yeah went to the right school obviously
B	he must have done
A	must have done dear boy
B	you know
B	erm
A	you think if that's on the other side
A	I'm not sure which side I'm really on here
B	I know
A	no no it isn't
B	you know
A	that's right no
B	it's not a perfect world
A	that's it's right
B	you know
A	I think
B	erm
A	my only point of you know sympathy for the England team is they've got Moeen Ali in it you know and you know that's
B	uhu
B	yeah
A	he
B	oh he's he er he's a good shows
A	okay
B	a lot of promise he's not the finished article yet but he's
A	right
B	played a handful of tests
A	right
B	but er
B	yes
A	in that kind of environment in that sort of dressing room with very secular bantery
B	and
A	entitled middle class
B	celebrating with alcohol and all this
A	with alcohol and that kind of stuff
B	yes yeah yeah well he went on record as saying that erm I I want to be a good
A	you can do the can be
B	you know
A	combined yeah
B	can can be combined
A	that's right
B	and erm
A	that's right yeah yeah yeah
B	erm somebody said of Muhammad Ali once that he was a credit to his race the human race
B	you know
A	yes absolutely
B	and I now you could say that about
A	that's right that's right
B	he he seems a thoroughly erm professional
A	absolutely yeah
B	and likeable one man from what
A	that's right
B	one sees
A	true true true true
B	of his public persona you know
A	and he's avoided or er yeah that's probably the right word being treated like Monty Panesar was
B	yeah
A	of being somewhat patronised
B	I I I don't think he's been patronised er Panesar it now looks as if
A	right
B	now know
A	oh is that right?
B	but er
A	I didn't know
B	yeah he's
A	Monty? that's amazing
B	yes yeah
A	but that's not the image that I think was being promoted by the press of being a rather erratic cuddly
B	yeah well
A	er
B	there was something
A	devil-may-care
B	something happened in his life
A	eccentric
B	and there were
A	okay
B	cos er I think he was drunk
A	oh
B	when he did the
A	okay okay okay
B	thing outside the nightclub of the bouncers I think it was
A	graduate of this
B	who Panesar?
A	yeah
B	is he?
A	yes he is
B	well I didn't teach him I taught Nick Knight briefly er and
A	now that's a name from the distant past
B	well yeah he he had a reasonable career as an opener for England but he
A	is that right?
B	only played about
A	when he came off the pitch did he say
A	and how long did he last as a cricketer?
B	he might he might have muttered something about
A	the criminal justice system
B	you know and
A	oh the jury's still out
A	taught
B	I'm innocent till proven guilty
B	that kind of stuff yeah but he's a commentator now on Sky but again he's not
A	okay
B	in the first rank of commentators he's sort of like in the
A	right right right
B	the reserve team
A	the
B	yeah or you know the the top people who do the test matches
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	or they they switch to the twenty
A	yes
B	twenty game
A	right okay
A	for sure
B	you know there are others in that category and
A	and of course for all we know sitting in our lectures there might well be that next generation they people wander around with Waitrose
B	oh yeah
A	written on their on their bags don't they?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know?
B	well especially in a place like this
B	mm
A	that's right yeah elite and all the rest of it yeah
B	yes well well I mean
B	as long as they can supply me with tickets to
B	yeah
A	oh yes
B	I've got er but er he wasn't an elite tennis player
A	mm
B	but erm
A	if he was a member of the Queen's Club is that what it's called?
B	no erm there used to be a young chap I can't remember his name now who was in politics and I taught him and he became a kind of a press officer for the
A	right
B	and they played at
A	right
B	gone off in a different career
A	mm
B	well he's not a young well he's a sort of
A	yeah yeah
B	mid-thirties now erm he was a student here and is an honorary official at Wimbledon
A	right
B	and for about the last seven or eight years he's been kind enough to get me tickets for various things and this year he's got me two tickets for the men's final
A	fantastic
B	they're half price tickets
A	that's just fantastic
B	for the men's final cos he can buy them
A	yes yes
B	you know and share them out
A	that's just extraordinary isn't it?
B	so they're not yet in my possession but
A	mm
B	the cheques have been cashed so to speak so I've no
B	no reason to suppose that er
A	good
B	that it it won't work
A	good good good
B	well I mean er I er er I will be going but erm er you know
A	sure sure
B	over
A	yeah sure
B	five hundred pounds
A	exactly
B	if I wished to
A	only certain people get the chance to buy it at face value presumably
B	yeah well I mean you
A	or does it go on open sale?
B	no there is a there's ballot
A	uhu uhu
B	and so people put in for the ballot
A	uhu
B	but
A	yeah
B	that kind of thing
A	right
B	and then there are small
A	sure
B	to buy
A	sure
B	a small number of tickets
A	numbers that's right yes
B	er and then there are debenture ticket holders they they can buy a ticket or so many tickets per day they hire a load to sell them for anything that they can get
A	no that's a bit
B	well it's written
A	off isn't it?
B	into the rules if so if you're got I think the last debenture call was you know you had to have something like sixty thousand pounds
A	sixty thousand
B	if you were a twenty-year-old and you had sixty thousand or your parents did it's worth buying because
A	because you could make that back
B	you would you would make money on it
A	yes that's right
B	you know
A	in the long term that's true
B	yeah
A	I mean it just seems very unfair that you should be able to sell them on for profit
B	well
A	given that you're
B	well because to do so in any other class of ticket is illegal
A	well that makes it doubly so doesn't it?
B	I think it
A	it makes it
B	I think it I think it's written on the tickets that I get from Wimbledon you cannot
A	not for exchange
B	no not for resale
A	that's right that's right
B	or something like that you know
A	it's very hard to know how you could ever police such a system
B	well I'd say it I mean unless it's going to come to the the to the
A	well
B	you know
A	in countries er we've had this discussion before like Italy and Spain where
B	yeah
A	you must carry your DNI all the time your
B	yeah
A	then it's plausible it's it's a feasible security system
B	yeah
A	to require people to bring their
B	yeah
A	identity
B	and
A	well but not in Britain because you're not
B	no
B	no
A	and the last thing you wanna do is take it to a rock concert for god's sake
B	well exactly
A	it's a ridiculous thing to do
B	and
A	mm
B	and and they were saying he's still doing it at the age of
A	yeah
B	seventy something
A	yeah
B	but I know for a fact as soon as that came online people would have snapped up the tickets
A	yes
B	and then the following day when you thought all the tickets were gone there's a ticket agency that's suddenly selling them
A	sure
B	but not at a hundred pounds a shot
A	no no okay
B	you know
A	right yeah
B	so you know that that might have been legitimate
A	sure
B	but tickets are being sold above their
A	sure
B	face value
A	sure
B	and some people say oh well that's just the market that's supply and demand get used to it
A	well
B	and others say and including some
A	mm
B	rock stars saying
A	yes
B	no no I
A	right
B	want them sold to fans at this price I don't want them
A	okay
B	going anywhere else
A	sure if they can get that
B	you know
A	er you know agreed er by the
B	yeah
A	and I got into Arsenal that way because what they do is somebody sells back their
B	yeah
A	er it actually it was Spurs sells back their ticket to
B	yeah
A	the agency at a price where they get three quarters of their money back
B	yeah
A	and the agency sells it at either face value or face value plus five percent
B	mm
A	so you get the chance to get a ticket
B	yeah I understand
A	whatever and they get a bit of an administration fee and so on
B	I
A	they do it for all kinds of things
B	what I was thinking of was slightly murkier
A	yes it is murkier
B	in the sense
A	sure
B	that they were getting hold of so many tickets
A	okay no that's
B	you know
A	a different kettle of fish okay right
B	that you wonder how it how it's being done you know and and the other big bone of contention of course is that er even even when things are legitimately being
A	yes sure
B	and then you have to pay a percentage because you haven't got the right card
A	right right
B	and then there's postage
A	okay
B	on top of it
A	sure
B	and it's it's a rip off
A	sure
B	and I know that various
A	true
B	various charges they they really should start looking at at that
A	well er
B	cos I know roaming charges for phones have
A	yes have been
B	come down and come down in
A	right okay
B	in recent years
A	eventually people even people like Ryanair realise that it's bad for their business and they have
B	yeah and in today's
A	exactly so
B	Independent is a report on their profits having soared
A	soared after they've
B	and their seat occupancy
A	right
B	rate having
A	sure sure
B	increased
A	I just
B	you know
A	held my nose and signed up for Ryanair to go to er
B	yeah
A	abroad
B	yeah
A	and it's much better than it used to be
B	it is
A	there is still one thing which is it drives you crazy which is the
B	yeah
A	if you don't want insurance you look for the I don't want insurance
B	mm
A	and it doesn't seem to be there
B	uhu
A	you've got to go through
B	oh
A	and it that is it
B	that that is a bit naughty isn't it?
A	it's a bit naughty that's right
B	yes you're right
A	and they could say well
B	it should simply well er
A	yeah
B	there are there there is a
A	that's it exactly that's true yes
B	but you're right it doesn't look
A	sure sure
B	doesn't come out as seventy pounds
A	sure
B	it's eighty-five and you wonder why
A	yeah why why is that?
B	you know and you've suddenly paid
A	sure sure
B	for insurance that perhaps you don't need
A	they're not the only ones
B	or you've already got from somewhere else
A	I mean Ryanair was er notorious but
B	yeah
A	I've recently had done other things where
B	mm
A	you discover it at the end that there's actually there's a
B	mm
A	extra administration charge
B	mm
A	as well which hasn't been
B	yes
A	and it's
B	yeah
A	you think oh god you know what am I gonna do? I might as well buy it so you just go ahead and do it
B	but it they they certainly have
A	right
B	but that was the only way I could get there I think erm
A	yes exactly so if there's any alternative
B	yeah
A	er very pleased to use any alternative
A	fine
B	go from Birmingham I think it was with erm Ryanair
A	yes if there's a choice of those two then they're both
B	yeah
A	they're both doable and yes I would avoid
B	yeah
A	mind you Luton Airport is so horrible er
B	well it is and there's roadworks there as well which didn't help
A	that's true
B	you know cos
A	that's true
B	I was going down by car but but having said
A	true
B	you know and you can
A	you can allocated seats and all the rest of it
B	you yes and you
A	that's right
B	and you can buy seats at quite I mean I think I bought seats at five pound each way I mean
A	yes
B	that's nothing
A	that
B	you know
A	that's right not compared to the price of the
B	erm and I and the thing was I didn't have to worry about fighting my way on the plane and since I was right down the front I got off it very quickly and with hand luggage I was out through er
A	exactly
B	passport control
A	exactly
B	in no time at all
A	exactly
B	because I was first in the queue
A	exactly that's right yes er I I've people are quite willing to pay the er five pounds for that
B	yeah I don't mind it for that
A	that's right it's in their interest
B	well I think I told you I had a whole bunch of
A	yes just by luck you can't
B	mm yeah
A	legislate
B	no
A	for that
B	no
A	but when it happens it's a great bonus
B	yeah I mean well especially on a flight like that
A	where the legroom is gonna be pretty crap so anything
B	yeah
A	you get is a is a bonus really
B	yeah yeah so er
A	that's right
B	where are you off to anyway? where where have you booked to go?
A	erm
B	oh Barcelona
A	yeah that's right
B	that's such a lovely place
A	I know I don't I just discovered though that it's on the same days as our open days
B	oh
A	so I hope I can get a er a friendly friend to er swap with me
B	ah
A	I'll do the June ones are you up for the June ones?
B	yeah well I I'm doing the June ones but then I have said I'm on holiday in September so we do we tend
A	okay
B	six of us
A	alright
B	so
A	that's fair enough
B	but I've always said that I am I am not rearranging my holidays around university open days thank you very much so I'll
A	yes right
B	do the June I don't mind you know
A	yeah er
B	you know
A	I I think if if there's enough of anybody in the
B	mm
A	that they some do this and some do that
B	yeah
A	then they could both get holidays it's not too bad
B	yeah
A	it's when you have to do there are so few of you that you have to do
B	it get
A	so
B	it gets to be tricky if X turns round just before the September one and says oh I've suddenly realised I've and
A	yeah no
B	and and no one's got any
A	that that's not on
B	you know
A	that's not on
B	er and then if you are around the pressure is on well I know
A	it of
B	you did June but would you
A	I know
B	come in and do it? you know
A	can you possibly er
B	but I think I'll be in Zimbabwe anyway so I'm I think I'm beyond their reach
A	yes that's a good one isn't it? I I
B	terribly sorry
A	I'm actually
B	I'm I
A	in Zimbabwe at the moment
B	I suppose if you if you paid for me to be come
A	yes
B	come back first class
A	that's
B	oh private plane is even better
A	that's
B	well
A	how could you get there?
B	well quite and I'd have to come back as well
A	that's of course
B	and make up for you know
A	that's right extra couple of days' holiday
B	well
A	in lieu
B	well I need an extra couple of days you know
A	for the stress
B	to get over the journey
A	yes yes
B	and the stress
A	exactly
B	yes I mean
A	of course you will
B	and
A	that's right so that's well it might be a good deal
B	well if they want me naturally
B	when duty calls
A	make sure you leave your international roaming number otherwise you know
A	it'll be the cleft stick
B	I hardly ever
A	going down
B	I hardly ever switch my phone on when I go abroad on holiday
A	yeah right
B	it doesn't seem
A	otherwise you know what you'll get
B	like I'm on holiday if I
A	it absolutely not
B	if I'm getting stuff like that
B	no I don't need that
A	righty-ho
B	I shall see you soon
A	see you
B	thank you very much for the coffee
