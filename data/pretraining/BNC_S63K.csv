A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and not even put that much effort in you know those kind of drawings that you look at and somebody
A	yeah
B	and they're always the highest priced ones as well
B	it's kinda like a weird style of art but really it's just
A	so why why was it all about dragonflies?
B	em the gallery is called Dragonfly Gallery and like this woman oh we spoke to the owner cos we spoke to the people doing it
A	oh
B	and so the owner came out she's got these dragonfly pins and everything she just loves dragonflies and she said the exhibition was supposed to be for her collection of dragonfly items
B	so pins and paintings and all of this
A	aww
B	so she didn't have any of her stuff on
B	but she couldn't sacrifice the artists' space kinda thing she was like well you know there were some some beautiful stuff there so it was like she didn't want to say sorry you can't have your dragonfly stuff
A	yeah yeah
B	no it's only little place
A	yeah
B	yeah so it was all a whole range of materials
A	yeah

A	yeah well
B	my dad said needs maintenance and you've got to keep on top of that otherwise you lose
A	to point out the pointing
B	mm yeah
A	it does need doing
B	yeah
A	it's the kinda thing I think if you are living in somewhere
B	Don't notice
A	you don't notice it yeah
B	but even as we left today they were looking it all the details of the house going Oh look at that
B	yeah so I think they've really started to have a look and ah yeah they wanna get everything done but that's gonna cost a fortune
A	yeah it's not cheap is it?
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	that costs enough and ah
A	they can do the ground floor ones can't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah it's just the ones above like the conservatory and stuff
B	but

A	they're going to be the only ones in dresses won't they?
B	I didn't say bridesmaids I said they could be matrons or something like that matrons and they said they'd stand if they were matrons they'd stand at the a gate and say hello to people or something I don't know
A	oh so if we've got bridesmaids what are they gonna do?
B	they're gonna meet and greet

A	oh Dave and Rick
B	Dave and Rick is that? Cos I was
A	yeah
B	and you yeah
A	yeah
B	but yeah deep
A	yeah it's okay to coordinate something that but I I think it's nice not coordinating as well because
B	well maybe you should
A	specially cos it's gonna be a lot of nature like entwined with the wedding
B	mm
A	if you conform too much to a certain look then it it makes it too human
B	yeah well I think
A	well too yeah
B	and well
B	and
B	but
B	I watched Spongebob with him today
A	did you?
B	mm
A	was it?
B	and Spongebob is angry
A	I've never seen it either
B	he's an angry character
A	yeah
B	and he was smashing things up
A	was that just today or was he like that every?
B	because he didn't  he didn't  want his friend to get up for the competition
A	oh
B	kind of thing is that?
B	I was going to the kids God I'd be really scared if someone hid in my pillow
A	yeah
B	not look up to him but they all see him as you know haha oh he's a cool character
A	I remember when I hid under my brother's bed
B	see you would have got that idea from the cartoon
A	actually fell asleep under his bed for a good couple of hours
B	aww
A	I just remember poking him under the bed
A	no
B	was he just petrified and better not able to even look underneath
A	he was terrified
A	oh dear
B	no that's quite funny though
A	and I hid in a I had like this monkey arm as well
B	oh no
A	so a similar effect
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think he has
B	yeah
A	so what are you doing tonight?
B	I was gonna do some work
A	it's eight o'clock now nearly
B	yeah see
A	yeah
B	sss aw I really haven't done enough work this week
A	yeah well I'm just
B	well make your film
A	yeah
B	there you go wait for it to get like dusky
A	well I need to make a storyboard a little bit and think of the scenes
B	you need the tripod
A	yeah
B	you could stick th microphone outside and try and get some some um animal noises
B	couldn't you?
A	yeah
B	I might play a game with mum ugh
A	that house is beautiful isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I do like that
A	not sure about those window frames though
B	no
A	does look like an old barn doesn't it? I quite like the way they they get those big windows put in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	all the way down
A	let's in
B	yeah
A	surprised they're allowed planning permission to be honest
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh
B	yeah
A	I've no idea how it works
B	I don't know
A	I think so though if it's got some kind of structure on it already
B	yeah
A	yeah well I hope it goes alright for them
B	yeah me too
A	do seem to be putting all their eggs in one basket though don't they?
A	oh are we invited are we?
B	I want to go and watch it
A	I don't know I might get
B	I was just gonna walk down
A	oh right could do
B	yeah
A	I might get twitchy though I might
B	they said afterwards they might fancy going to the pub so we could take them to there
A	yeah
B	you know you get twitchy and put your arm
B	no problem
B	well we wouldn't have any deposit
A	is it just land? Is that?
B	ah it's all sorts
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	I'm surprised they haven't gone to view some more land but they just fell in love with this one
B	yeah
A	well don't they need to know that before they buy it?
B	yeah
B	yeah they will
A	how are they gonna find that out?
B	there's supposed to be a big package coming through their door with all of the information about the land
A	okay
B	the the legal pack
A	okay
B	Cos you have to read the legal pack before you buy it don't you
A	or you should do
B	the whole
A	yeah do they have to pay for it?
B	ah don't think so
A	really? What you can just get any property and get a legal pack for it
B	Don't know
A	well can't see how they can just give it out
B	yeah I suppose
A	well I think if anyone has to pay for it it would be the seller
B	yeah
A	is that a sparrow
B	mm
A	next Thursday
B	yeah
A	okay
B	I thought it's in the afternoon so I thought I'd just wander down to
A	oh next Thursday we might know if we're going or not
B	yeah? Yeah
A	yeah
B	well if it's not a positive answer by next week I'm gonna really lose heart
B	we'll chip in
A	yeah once they have got his they won't be able to leave the country again
B	no
A	it's getting serious
B	mm
B	yeah
A	no more pissing about
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but with with this building a house lark it's not gonna happen for
A	no
B	ten years
A	yeah
B	I mean I don't get it
A	well I can see where they're coming from like I mean first of all they want an investment that's gonna store it's wealth which land is a great way to do that
B	mhm
A	Don't think houses are necessarily good at the moment because they are so inflated
B	no
A	but land is
B	yeah
A	like what they're looking at to see the idea
B	and it could really work out
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and it's not somewhere where you'd be able to call home for a good ten years
B	yeah
A	at least
B	see that's the thing I think
A	is he?
B	well he they've moved to
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	but what
A	oh yeah
B	there's a
A	specially if there's a what? How many of them? Four?
B	mm
A	yeah so that's gonna be a couple of tents like big tents
B	yeah
A	like straight off
B	and if the five of them are cooking their tea and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	it will until
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah exactly
B	mm they could do
A	and then that'll be a record of them being on the land and then they've got forty days from that moment haven't they? So
B	well I don't know
A	oh what leave for a day and then come back again?
B	huh?
A	like doing a visa run or something?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I mean
B	you won't have an address until you've built a house
A	right
B	so you can't
A	okay
B	Cos you you have to have an address to go to school
A	oh dear
B	but I don't know  I don't know
A	aw I admire their bravery
B	yeah I just hope it all works out as like a  like a  dream
A	it'll be interesting to see what happens
B	mm
B	but I've told em what I think
A	yeah
B	and we don't want to keep feeding them oh you gotta think about this and think about that
A	yeah well as long as they're aware of them then it is up to them isn't it?
B	but okay
A	I mean and you have voiced
B	ooo I hope it works out with them
A	yeah
B	we can go and stay there
A	I mean how long were they realistically gonna want to live in a tent for? Seriously?
B	yeah with Ray working so hard I mean he works all the hours under the sun
A	yeah
B	and
A	what are they doing for heating and stuff like that?
B	yeah eh
A	I don't
B	yeah
A	I just don't know if they've
B	yeah
A	although they are very spontaneous though aren't they so?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just asking little
A	I don't want to ask them before they buy it
B	no
A	yeah no
A	yeah
B	and knowing them it will work out perfectly
A	well I dunno
B	well with that they
A	didn't have much luck in Spain
B	well no but they did to begin with and then like
A	well they are
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he helped them all out
A	yep
B	you gonna make it?
A	I can't wait to get back actually my hand is frozen holding this thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	nice round number
B	that's it I might play one quick game with dad dad wants me to play and then  and then  I'm gonna stay in the warm
A	yeah he was happy he beat me earlier
B	yeah yeah
B	well yeah you've been on a run of winning
A	well I don't think I've lost this year
B	no

B	yeah yeah
A	no
