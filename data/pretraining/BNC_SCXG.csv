A	but I like those erm artificial logs because
B	yes
A	they're very easy to light actually I find
B	yes they are
A	really easy
B	indeed they are
A	and they they're good for actually getting it started before you put the er
B	yeah
A	the real wood on
B	but they're also extremely exothermic you know so they're they're very
A	what's exothermic?

C	yes well done ma it's a whopper
B	yes
C	mm what's
C	oh
B	so there you are
D	yeah there's pakoras
A	so you must have had to get a whole tool
B	well er
A	and hammer nails
D	this is a bottle we opened
C	this is a Pauillac of two thousand and two very nice
D	and I thought that you might not want it
C	I'll more more
D	yeah or this yeah finish this what's in the
C	oh yeah yeah
D	the bottle and yeah
B	oh yeah hammers and tacks and things
A	yeah
B	and
A	cos I imagined it was a sewing machine job but of course it's not really is it?
B	no no it's not it's it's nothing to do with the sewing machine actually
A	no yeah
B	yeah and erm er yeah it's
A	it's banging nails
B	just a case of dismantling well it's the dismantling it's
A	and knowing where to fold the fabric as well
B	well yes and how you know how to fold it
A	yes exactly
B	because you
A	which is what you must
B	you start you start along one edge
A	yeah
B	er on the upside down and you you spread it out and tack it sort of one two three and then then you pull it really tight
A	yes
B	and bring the other the opposite side up
A	like
B	and tack it
A	a bit like wrapping a present but very very neatly
B	erm in a way actually
A	yes
B	yes you do actually
A	yeah
B	you do that and then you do
A	the folding thing
B	er you do the well I do the sides I do the
A	yes
B	do a sort of tacked took that much towards a corner
A	yeah
B	and then and then I decide how I'm going to play around with that and and then I cut it
A	yes
B	in situ
A	yeah
B	you know to to where I want to trim it
D	now these were the
C	er they sell that make yeah but they do it online
D	you have
A	so
B	yeah
A	really paid dividends
B	yes
A	then didn't it?
B	yes yeah yeah
A	all those years ago cos it
B	cos er I've done I mean I've done I did our dining room ones at
A	yes
B	I mean we we don't have it any longer we sold it
B	when we moved down to number
A	yes yeah
B	but that was more difficult because the seats you couldn't remove they were
A	oh
B	part of it
A	yeah that must be
B	so that er was more challenging I think
A	mm
B	but no I think they look they look yeah yeah
A	that must be quite a fun process actually cos you have all er depending on what you're doing
B	yeah yeah
A	some are more challenging than others and
A	yeah I mean this these sort of things
A	yeah exactly
B	are stitching
A	yes
B	jobs erm
A	well do they
B	you know
A	they must stitch them
B	I mean I never ever
A	when they're
B	ever got onto something like this I wish I had
A	do they stitch them before they've put them on?
B	well they they must stitch things like this cos that's all all stitched and piped so they
A	yeah piping yes
B	obviously take templates and things and
A	yeah
B	and measure that but then these that bit is stitched in situ and
A	oh so it's all
B	you need a very special
A	all about the measuring and
B	a needle yeah yeah
A	shapes and the
B	yeah
A	pattern
B	and the pattern
A	and the yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	quite a fine art
D	it's a period piece
A	that chair?
D	yes mm
A	oh
B	mm
A	so far as I know
B	yeah
A	that's
D	well yes
B	she may not want anything back actually
A	yeah
B	when she
C	yeah
A	cos is she going for something different er to her usual style?
B	mm
B	it's looking very modern isn't it?
C	I don't know
B	yeah
A	mm
C	just looks like a municipal hospital
B	what you mean
C	that's what everyone said
A	maybe she likes that look though
B	oh
A	yes
B	you know so it it works to the benefit of of everybody because the people
B	the house that's behind them is actually higher up erm
A	mm
B	but there's quite a big garden
A	yeah
B	to the wall of the walled garden where their place is
A	they are yes
B	so they're not sort of here and there it's not a totally in your face thing
A	uhu
B	but erm if they built it up well when they build it up the
A	mm
B	to see into the garden and things so but
A	mm clever
D	it's a good one
B	yeah
A	mm
D	they've gotta find bloody jobs first before then can
B	yeah
D	do this
A	there's always that
D	fancy business
A	slight inconvenience isn't there?
B	convenience yes
A	that's what I thought
B	new development
B	but they
A	spent it have they?
B	well yes when you think they've been to
A	coming back again
B	by the time they've got back to the UK
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	it it will
A	it's easy to do though isn't it?
B	I mean yeah I mean they've had a fabulous
A	well exactly
B	er thing I mean they go off
A	yeah
B	to Australia in about three weeks' time and then
A	and they it's not like they're gonna have a problem getting a job really cos they've both got
B	no
A	you know careers
B	and you know
A	proper careers
A	yeah he
B	and things so it it
A	he's never gonna have a problem
B	should be alright
A	and neither is
B	yeah
A	so
B	I mean certainly it's something they always wanted to do so and they've actually managed to do it so
A	yes exactly
B	it's so yes so that's
A	one to tick off the list
B	yeah good
A	yes
B	yeah yeah
A	better than having it hanging around thinking oh I should have done that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so what are your next door neighbours like?

C	give me an
D	not as much as that I don't the viola might ought to
C	oh
B	well if he can't play it there's no point in keeping it
C	well there is I don't play my little ukulele but it looks quite pretty
B	I've gone off it
B	ah
A	you can play your little ukulele
B	you should you took that quite seriously when you started didn't he?
C	had lessons yes
A	he did he unfortunately just went round the same chords and didn't progress
A	any further
C	it was the song I was working on
A	it got a bit trying
B	did he not practise?
A	he practised the same chords
C	darling could you bring up one of the heat logs from under the stairs?
A	yeah
C	sorry
D	that's very good that
B	ah and
D	I love them
C	yeah very good
D	Ebay?
C	er vintage antique shop in
D	mm
B	and how much were they?
C	where did I put my glass? it's not there
B	here? no
D	er
C	she's like dad
D	very
C	we bought that in the same shop on the same day
B	oh that's
C	no
B	oh
C	and we bought one other thing there as well it think
D	yes
B	how much were the ducks?
C	I think we oh er
D	I bet
C	and it's one of those antique shops where different vendors display their work
B	oh right erm
C	so you can't actually
B	you can't bargain because
C	bargain cos they're not there
B	somebody's selling it on behalf of somebody who isn't there
C	so we got the maximum that they were allowed to take off which was like
B	yeah
C	I dunno five or
D	there's a shop in
B	I've got
C	darling I think you took my wine glass away
A	oh
D	where we got the coaster
C	in
B	yes
C	erm
B	it's a huge place
C	no it's
D	no
C	a little place just up from the station
B	oh no that's a different we don't know that one
C	around the corner from the station
D	you're thinking of
B	oh right
C	yeah
C	probably not thinking of
B	oh right yes yeah
D	there was a nice little place we found there
B	liked
D	loved them
B	yeah
D	we may well have bought something
B	yeah
D	but I don't remember
B	but
C	forty-five quid I think I paid for them
B	forty-five?
C	yeah
B	that seems alright
C	that just rings a bell
B	yeah
D	ah
C	yeah
D	they're metal aren't they?
B	yeah
D	it's a bit
B	that's what makes them very unusual actually
D	yeah
B	as I said I meant that cat cats must have a sixth sense because
D	oh
B	why did they pick why did he pick you know number two
B	to hone in on?
B	yeah
D	quite unlike humans
B	quite unlike dogs
D	yeah
B	well I mean and dogs are such a time-consuming beast and you see all those people whatever the weather
D	oh dear yes
B	walking up and down and and
D	oh dear
B	yeah
D	people becoming devoted
B	yeah
D	and of course it's reciprocated so it's a great er
B	yeah
D	or coming back and there was this sight of there's this woman with this cat on a lead
C	oh can I have a glass? did you
A	there
B	what is it they say that quite clever little statement about dogs have
D	what's that little saying?
A	mm
B	you don't talk about what?
C	that
A	the thing we don't talk about
C	what's what what?
A	what's what what what what what what what?
C	mummy?
B	yes thank you
C	what's what?
B	what's what what what?
C	well you said what's that stick or something
A	and you said what's something
B	yes
C	mm
B	oh no yes erm what do they say about dogs and cats?
C	they don't mix
A	er
B	no one have masters and er is a sort of er
A	oh
B	yes you know it implies that you know
A	erm
B	you spend your time looking after a cat
A	well it's the opposite er
A	one's got a master and then the cat is the master
C	the the saying I know is dogs look up to you cats look down at you
C	and pigs look you square in the eye
A	it's something to do with the ownership
B	yes it is it's it's something have masters
A	but dogs
B	and well it must be cats
A	are owned and cats are the ones who own
B	yeah
A	the owner
B	yeah
A	yes but I know
B	yeah
A	the one you mean
B	yeah
A	yeah cats have staff
B	no no dogs oh yes yeah
C	mm
B	it is actually
A	well
C	it'll be something like that
B	dogs
A	no that's that's like mine really but
B	dogs have masters and
C	mm
B	it's like that's
C	if that's not it
B	that's even better actually
C	it very well could be
A	it is quite good
C	that's rather better than the one I'm trying to think of actually
B	well
C	Arsenal
B	Arsenal are doing rather badly
C	were they?
D	mm
C	and they haven't won anything since then?
C	they've won a couple of games
B	yeah
C	they've been knocked out
B	and
C	of two competitions
B	really? so how can they go from being top of the league to being nobody at all?
C	well
B	and
A	good question
C	good question
B	yeah and how's Leicester?
C	they're still top dear
B	to think they I mean that'll be amazing if they go because weren't they on the point of relegation or something?
C	er last year they were yeah
B	yeah
D	what did you think of the erm Welsh English game?
C	terrific
D	yeah another ten minutes and the Wales the Welsh might have won them
C	yeah
D	they left it too late the
B	or conversely if they'd woken up ten minutes earlier
D	well yeah the
B	er in the match they yeah
D	they were run off their feet in the first half really but
B	no
D	that's right
B	cos
D	there's
C	did he?
D	there's devotion
B	yes well I mean he comes over very regularly to see his parents actually but it coincides with a match
D	in Cardiff
B	which is the other end of Wales of where his parents live it must be said but his son lives there so
D	where do they live do you know where it is?
B	no
C	in Wales?
B	can't quite no it's in the north of Wales yeah
D	it is yeah
B	yeah
A	what do you think of plans for all schools to become academies
B	well
A	what does it mean exactly?
B	well it it means that they they cease to be under control of the of the local
A	authority
B	county council the local authority actually
A	yeah
B	they get funded directly by the government so it actually means that each school has more control over how it spends its money
A	oh okay
B	erm
D	I think it's all explained in
B	so
D	in the Independent isn't it?
D	yeah
B	is it indeed?
A	yeah is that
B	yeah yeah
A	a good thing or a bad thing?
B	erm it very much depends
A	well a double
B	well it depends
A	edged sword then or
A	yeah
B	because some
A	yeah
B	conversely some heads will be very good at handling their own but
A	yes
B	but er some heads will be completely at sea
A	mm
B	it'll probably require each school to have much more of a business manager
A	oh yes of course yeah
B	within them erm
A	mm
B	so er you know it's er it's a very sort of sweeping statement
A	I wonder why though
B	they've also they've
A	but do you know what the motive for it is?
B	no
A	they've usually got a motive
B	yeah
A	this government haven't they?
B	they
B	parents at least one parent governor
A	yeah
B	erm and that is no longer a statutory requirement although I actually think it's a very good thing to have a parent governor
A	mm
A	compulsory maths lessons
A	until eighteen
B	the other thing they're suggesting or the
C	crazy
B	is that
A	mm
B	the school day should be extended by an hour so instead of three
A	yeah
B	would go on till four
A	it seems awfully short
B	well I quite agree with you actually
A	yeah
B	yeah I think
C	well it's never factored in when people have the debate about the percentage of privately educated students getting into say Oxbridge as opposed to from erm
B	from a state yeah
A	that they get an extra hour
C	if you go a private school you you've had
A	an extra hour
C	an additional half day Saturday at school
B	yeah yeah
C	every week that you've been at school
A	yeah
B	plus hours for each day
C	plus additional hours
A	so five five hours a week
C	every single day so the sum of your education
B	is twice as long
C	is is vastly
B	yeah longer
C	yeah longer than someone from a state school
A	five times a hundred and fifty-two
C	cos you see state school students I mean you know old A level students wandering home at half three four
B	oh well schools finish at three
C	well
A	yeah
C	we'd be midway through your day
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
C	you still have two hours or lessons
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean it's that's not rocket science either is it?
B	no
A	the reason why
B	yeah
C	mm it's only one of the reasons there also is obviously an inbuilt institutional
B	expectation
C	institutionalised poshism
A	social reasons
B	well there are
A	oh well no
B	no I think there are also sort of built-in expectations
A	yeah that's the social reasons
B	which and usually erm almost inevitably not necessarily for good reasons but there's far more parental support than in a state school a state school
C	yeah
B	you know there oodles of
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	the parental
A	but
B	response
A	yes
C	whereas at my school
B	and of course that was the reason you know why the boy was as far off track as he was actually
A	mm exactly
C	and at my school it's just assumed it's not even a question that
D	hello
C	you go to university after A levels
B	yeah exactly
C	that's why you do A levels
B	yeah yeah
C	cos that determines what university you go to
B	yeah and you tend to come from a parental body
C	and
B	who've been there before you anyway
C	yeah but also no matter what your academic ability that was the assumption
B	yeah yes
C	er the only exceptions were a few people who were going into their parents' business
B	yes yeah
C	but that
B	yeah
C	one percent
B	yeah
C	and I can only think of one one or two people who did that
B	yeah
A	I need to check the potatoes
C	let's just get this flaming again
B	yeah I think yes it's
C	oh it is open that's strange oh so is that
B	mm
C	with the vent and everything
B	I was er
C	uhu
B	so they you know the neighbours who had just moved in were the ones over the road
C	yeah
B	but you've now got them there and next door
C	there's a few they're not particularly noisy they have small child
B	how many are there?
C	dunno
B	no
C	seems to be one family
B	yeah well that's good yeah
C	er fuck knows
B	do they not?
C	so
C	who spoke some English and then took it off the
B	off the street yeah
C	the street it was quite good
B	actually that's that's what you have to do actually really in a sense quite nicely just say to people well actually we don't do that
C	yeah
B	here
C	uhu
B	yeah
C	and tomorrow interestingly is the the department where I accidentally sort of ended up after the merger before I said I'm not doing that job any
B	yeah
C	that whole department has been sent to India outsourced to India
C	and everyone's been laid off including
B	really?
C	well everyone except for the big manager who will now sort of just
B	oh right yeah
C	aye aye
B	gosh
C	so their leaving do is tomorrow and their last day
B	yeah
C	is tomorrow
B	and how is your department doing?
C	uhu
B	and are you enjoying it?
C	yeah
B	yeah and is it cerebrally interesting enough?
C	it's more cerebrally interesting than my last jog
B	oh well that's good
C	you need a good
B	what? oh sorry wait a minute say that again dear
C	you need a good vocabulary and you need to be able to think things through
B	yeah yeah well then you're ideal
C	so it's good yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah that
B	yeah
C	went well
B	yeah any pay rise since?
C	but the new system is that pay rises are linked to your assessment
B	right
C	which is actually just an excuse for not paying people much that if they don't perform up to
B	yeah
B	well
C	well my boss my my big boss the company owner just awarded himself a sixty million pound bonus for the year and that's on top of his salary
D	nice
B	the owner of the company?
C	the
B	where did he start off?
C	of our holding company
B	yeah sixty bloody million?
C	no Martin Sorrell
C	dad will have heard of him
B	have you? have you heard of Martin Sorrell?

A	pudding
B	no mm
A	do you want side plates?
C	you can't make tablet without a heat thermometer
B	I never make any sweets with a with a
C	that's why you never make tablet
B	no just I know what I have to do with that
A	does anyone want a side plate?
B	I've got
C	yeah
A	ah
A	but wasn't this for uncle
C	uhu
A	we've commandeered it have we?

C	well it would be rejected it as tablet
B	er aye? mind you it's tasty isn't it? but
A	mm
B	fudge tablet it's just a matter of a few degrees of cooking and I obviously missed out on that
D	does tablet use any form any form of milk in it?
B	uhu
D	yes
B	I mean the recipe's very
D	mm
B	erm
C	it's the same as fudge it's just the temperature and
B	it's just you you take it up to
A	it's harder
B	a little bit er
A	mm
B	a a little bit higher in temperature
A	dry out a little bit
B	yeah mm
A	yeah
C	well I still maintain you need a heat thermometer
B	well oh you I mean er that's an infallible way of making it
B	yeah
B	but when I took took it up to to my brother on his birthday
C	mm
B	well I
A	mm
C	that was nice that stuff
B	yeah
C	and also do you remember
B	yeah and his
B	his eyes

B	mm yeah
A	came
C	and do you remember when we were there mum and I went what's this? it's tablet
D	mm
C	and cos
C	straight away
A	good for him
C	and then mum said we'll just try it
A	er
B	and we ended up
A	you can't have that
B	no we ended up both having a piece of it
A	oh
B	cos why not damn it?
A	cos it's
B	well he
A	tablet
A	oh it's good
B	it is good actually isn't it?
A	just feeling that sugar going round though
C	mm
B	yeah
B	you should call this Osborne dessert
C	mm
A	type two diabetes
C	I've put the lid on to stop me eating more and more
B	oh
A	oh
C	yeah oh yeah
A	it is mainly sugar isn't it?
B	yeah cos in fact this recipe there's condensed milk in it I love
A	so sugar and condensed milk
B	I I love any recipe with
A	with condensed milk
B	condensed milk because I just love condensed milk
A	yeah I get confused between evaporated milk
B	oh no
A	and condensed milk
B	condensed is
D	mm
B	a thick one
A	but yes I know I know I remember it
B	yes yeah
A	and my dad used to just spoon it
A	he would just eat it
B	yes yes
A	on its own
C	that's what
B	well I
C	of a certain generation
B	I well I think
A	hence the type two diabetes in later life
B	no I think it
B	it's it's Second World War deprivation
C	yeah
A	oh yeah it's true
B	yeah I think it is
A	yeah that as well
B	but er when I was at at boarding school and that was in the fifties for some reason or other
A	oh
B	rather like toothpaste tubes
A	yeah
B	so I had
B	condensed milk in my tuck box
A	oh
C	did they have it in India father?
D	yes
A	mm
D	yes yeah the condensed milks
A	it's really good stuff
D	were popular two you'd bang two holes
A	yeah
B	oh to get the air in
D	to get in
A	and knock it back
B	mm
A	a shot
B	but I think it must have been something to do with sort of you know deprivation of
C	yeah
A	treats
B	yes yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	well there's no sugar
C	you mean during er
A	no no
B	and of course there there weren't any any sweets or anything
A	no
B	so you know
C	rations
A	but
B	yeah
A	apparently people were quite healthy for it
B	yeah oh yes yeah
A	they would be
B	oh yeah I mean there was no obesity or anything
A	just through not having sugar and all those sorts of things
B	yeah
C	mm
B	well it's
A	even though it was probably quite a limited diet
B	yeah but I mean nowadays there's there are something like fifty percent of primary school children
A	see the trouble is
B	are obese
A	when it's there I have to eat it
C	yeah yeah that would all be gone
A	well
B	would it?
A	why would you want to stop?
D	yeah
B	oh I I couldn't eat all that
B	you couldn't eat all
B	you could you?
A	no I couldn't but
A	no I couldn't not that if it was a packet of biscuits I could
B	really?
C	if it's a packet of biscuits
A	yeah no I can't stop
B	what about a box of chocolates?

B	what
A	box
B	yeah
A	but erm
C	well shall we move back through to the
