A	erm I haven't played the board game for a long time but yeah it was fun
B	yeah I did

B	yeah
C	and like Monopoly's so long I don't like that any more
A	no I don't I I was thinking about that earlier cos like it's like the Christmas game isn't it Monopoly? but
B	yeah
C	I loved it when I was younger I just loved it so much and my parents were always like oh not again but now I don't think
A	I also they it's like non-
C	yeah
A	there's so much more out there whereas Monopoly is almost like oh we don't really play our board games well we play a family game once a year and we'll just play that
B	yeah
A	whereas
C	do you play lots of board games in your family?
A	oh I am the board game queen
C	really?
C	ah
A	it's I feel a bit sad actually because like my family on Christmas like my dad and my two sisters kind of rely on me to be the let's get everyone going let's play some games and I do have like a huge collection because I love it it's like
C	I love
A	yeah because what else how else can it's cheap you're not spending any money erm if you're
A	recently had quite a few kind of things at our house like
C	I
A	come out
C	I love them have you have you played Balderdash?
A	yes which one is that?
C	it's a bit like where you have like you have a card and on it you have erm like either a year or a film title or a name and
A	yes we played that at in your do you remember
B	did we do that? really?
A	yeah and we played it
B	yeah
A	I played it recently as well and I get like
C	I love it absolutely love it
B	there he goes on
C	I've got that
B	live
C	oh gone oh I'm gonna share it
A	is it on Instagram? cos it don't have that
C	no on Facebook
B	no
A	oh I'm so proud of you
B	my boss is so gonna be like erm
A	well what can she say? like
C	you might get you might get fired and then that's quite good cos your decision's
B	yeah
C	made for you
B	it's just a bit of work on the side though isn't it?
C	I just
A	are you maybe it's just that I need to just tell them and say look I'm doing some freelance work but like I got this out of the blue like I
C	it's not like it's not at all kind of competing against
A	no absolutely
C	it's not direct competition
A	it's absolutely not and if I asked they'd be absolutely fine with it I'm just wondering whether
C	I think it's fine
C	mm what does she work in?
A	erm
C	so what does that mean?
A	she is in charge of all restaurant menus and everything
C	oh that's why she wants to do this side business of she's
A	cos that's what she does already
C	yeah
A	and
C	well that's really cool
A	she's just very fortunate especially like the restaurant business she's
C	mm
A	I guess now it makes sense
C	did you start at the same time with her? has she been there longer than you?
A	no a shorter time but it's because she was she's been she's doing a different so
C	yeah yeah yeah it's just totally different
A	I was employed as I'm on I'm I'm on in the media I don't wanna be in a restaurants and she was employed as a restaurant editor so even though up until recently we both were earning the same amount of money we're both on the same level even though her title is better
C	or better what does better mean?
A	oh cute
C	ah
C	I love it it's brilliant
B	oh yeah
A	I want to be like oh I'm so proud of you but in my head it's like oh like what we've just the banter we've just been I'm so proud of you
C	it's so lame
A	remember us when you're like a bit star but then I was like but if somebody reads that like your boss then they'd be like
B	yeah
C	oh what's she got planned?
A	yeah so I was like just keep it to a minimum
C	we can say it to your face
B	true
A	thanks
B	erm
C	yes
B	and I'm really worried that I'm gonna like say something which might upset her so if I do can you just like hit me?
C	and me
A	erm I mean just I mean I guess it
B	I'm gonna act normal
A	at best I didn't
B	but it's not fair for her
A	I didn't expect her to come so if I if I knew she was gonna come I wouldn't have told you cos otherwise you're gonna feel
B	no it's just I'm really shit at like always being
C	you're not
B	well I am cos also my mum and I don't get on so if somebody's like so and I'm like oh I don't get on with my mum that's so insensitive isn't it?
A	and you're yeah but just it she's I think she's
B	okay so just be normal yeah
C	probably best to be not cos if you if you were then to like stopped yourself it would be really even more awkward
B	yeah
A	and
B	so it's
A	you have
C	I don't think I have
B	who
A	no so actually
A	maybe yes
C	maybe
C	she's all over Facebook isn't she?
A	oh god
B	who's
A	she's so fucking opinionated do you remember
C	oh
B	I I yeah I remember didn't
C	no
C	they broke up quite a while ago
A	yeah
B	cos she's
C	but
B	like
C	she is lovely when I see her she's always really nice but don't see her
A	what was it?
C	mm
A	I I think she's nice but like the same thing like she always has to have an are you friends with her on Facebook?
B	I
A	you're probably not then cos she's so opinionated and I appreciate she is an intelligent girl she's got I mean I I agree with a lot of her opinions
C	and she works in politics so she's obviously around those kind of people
A	yeah
C	all the time and I no I always agree with her
A	I agree with her but it's like you're being opinionated
C	mm
A	to just make a point? like basically you're saying the same thing as everyone else you just don't need to say that you know? and she's just like you're just saying pointless things shut up
B	no it's not like
C	well I
B	we know or are friends with
C	I just think don't put it on just don't put it out there
A	just say it to your mates
C	oh good idea
B	and they're starting to like look at mine and be like can I see her face?
C	yeah if
C	it was really weird I was in the steam room when you two were having your like massages earlier and it was like I couldn't see anything but there were like people and it was so silent
A	did you go in the
C	yeah but I was like really conscious that there were bodies around me but I couldn't see the faces
A	yeah freaky
C	and I was on my own and I got really scared I was like this is a setting for a horror movie
B	it is yeah yeah no you say oh
C	like all deep underground
B	you
B	oh we
C	so I
B	would
C	well hopefully you
B	we might have er
C	no
A	oh my god look at this
C	who's that?
A	this is
C	oh my god
C	where was this?
A	his sister just put it up and she said dug this out of the archives
B	what? he looks like a fucking woman
B	what is he doing?
A	this is before I knew him
B	what is he doing?
A	it's
B	and how old is his sister?
A	she's a couple of years older
B	she's a good egg isn't she? do you get on with her?
A	yeah she's nice
B	he looks absolutely fucked could have been around Christmas
C	oh that's funny
A	wow
C	I'm quite pleased we didn't grow up with like videos like
B	oh I know
C	cos I'd just made such an idiot of myself but no one no one's got any evidence
B	yeah it's true
A	games night yes I am gonna head over with
B	no
C	I saw half of one the other day cos I remember saying
B	yeah
C	and just was like channel
A	four?
C	yeah
A	did you watch some of it?
C	I watched like yeah it was like erm a guy who had like Asperger's is it Asperger's?
A	yeah he was quite funny wasn't he?
C	he was hilarious he just made really inappropriate jokes
A	yeah
C	at inappropriate moments
A	yeah it was really good
C	yeah
A	it's a really nice show cos it's basically people with disabilities or they're
C	mm
A	just like really and even Tourette's actually and erm the show just shows just like how normal these people are and like just sort of raises awareness about what Asperger's is and like why people are like they are and and they and they're getting put on dates and it's not about you'd think it's like just a ridiculing thing like they're put on a date and see how they like fuck it up but it's not that at all
C	it's not
A	like sometimes they like it goes really well or and it's like really nice you just think
B	oh
A	oh
B	did you we discussed that that erm Channel Four show erm Married at First Sight
C	what's that?
A	oh my god did we watch that together?
C	I've not seen that
A	no
B	no but we
A	did you see it?
B	yeah you need to watch it and I
C	Married at First Sight? so literally
B	yeah it's it's a Channel Four thing I it should still be on the internet somewhere
C	yeah
B	erm and yeah they
C	yeah
B	and they had like six hundred applicants and this er the point was that you would be matched by these scientists according to what science dictates erm how you who you would end up with and so you'd go like the first episode is like how they did it and what they're what they're doing and then they match they get three couples by the end of it and then basically these couples never meet the first time they meet is when the
A	it literally that
B	and
A	and their first words are just before they say I do basically
C	no way
A	it actually happens
C	and what
B	and then they're
C	people go through this?
B	they're also their first conversations to be like hi is in front of all of their friends and family
C	oh my god
B	on both sides and it's like so what do you do?
A	honestly
B	and like everybody's there watching them and then
A	and
C	and they they have no choice like they have to get married?
A	yes
C	or
A	or like I mean obviously you can always pull out
A	but at that point
A	when everyone has made the effort to be there your whole family are there everyone is dressed up they've come to your fucking wedding
C	you must be mental to go ahead with that right?
A	I know but like you would have thought that people are just a bit insane or whatever but
B	yeah really professional and they were just
A	and I
C	and do do they stay together like?
B	er
A	you
B	you have to watch it
C	oh
B	you have got to watch like
C	okay
A	and you must
C	alright I will
B	it's a really interesting thing and erm
C	Channel Four is such
A	basically one stays together and one doesn't
C	oh okay
A	but you it's not
B	yeah I no I'm
B	there was
B	you
C	okay
B	take all the magic out of the situation
B	yeah
A	sorry
A	so basically what happens is one has a kid
B	would you you
B	do you ever did you ever know
A	yeah
C	what
B	erm
C	oh it's
B	yeah so I casually watching this documentary really like de de and I know

B	so watching this documentary diddle le le one of this this girls is blonde
C	hang on this this scientific this
B	yeah
C	oh okay he's on it?
B	and then suddenly
C	no way
B	and like and he's having an interview with his sister cos his sister was one of the girls who got erm shortlisted
C	and did she end up with someone?
B	no basically they dropped those couple dropped out before the
B	literally went did all of that and then they backed out of it
A	yeah
B	because apparently the family put pressure on them and I can imagine that cos like I can imagine that
A	I guess you sort of like go you'd humour
C	yeah and
A	it is I remember me and
C	is it new? or when was it?
A	well it's been out like six months
B	about six eight months old
C	I can't believe I haven't even heard of it
B	and er we were just all talking about it at work so the first one is just like they're talking about it like they're getting the wedding dress like
A	oh my god
B	and like it's all about the scientists and like the the psychologist and all that like discussing who should go with who and then the second episode is when they actually like get married and you're just like it's so tense cos you're like oh my god and you can see the groom is like
A	oh
B	so nervous just standing there the a stranger's like his wife's family are all there and he's like hi like saying hi to the mum
A	yeah
B	he meets the mum
C	oh my god
B	before he meets her
C	no way oh my
B	and then the final episode is like the honeymoon and they they but basically they move in with each other for six weeks after the honeymoon
A	I wanna watch it again
B	after the honeymoon and after that they decide whether they divorce or
C	and one divorced one didn't?
B	I don't I don't know if they divorced oh no
A	erm cos you get an
B	I thought you got annulled if you hadn't had sex
