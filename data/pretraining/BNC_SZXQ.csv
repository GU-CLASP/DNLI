A	if you like
B	not fussed? We will see how it goes
A	ah so revealing my deepest darkest secrets
A	would be um a gamble
A	hm
B	I've been watching too much Friends
A	yeah
B	between Friends and Magnum
A	that's probably not much healthier
A	yes
B	well
A	of course
B	er of course
A	of course
B	well he actually fell in love with her rather than just being like hm she's quite hot
B	um it's kind of
A	are they identical twins?
B	they're identical twins
A	oh dear
B	um
A	wow
B	yeah
A	normally it's just driving around in a fancy car
B	mm
A	joking about Higgins' Britishness
B	exactly
A	hm
B	still haven't watched that
A	mm
B	is it out on DVD?
A	I'm sure it is
A	mm
B	not just you
A	mm
B	half an hour everything happens type thing
A	yeah
B	mm
A	everything happens
B	like Brideshead
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then about ten minutes before the end of the final episode of the second series you think oh
B	yeah
A	they're not gonna be making any more series
B	Cos it's gotta end
A	but no
B	mm
A	actually there might be more series
B	oh
A	but um yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	er it's it's it's always good if it's actually had an effect on you rather than being like oh it's okay
A	mm
B	which is a tendency with a lot of
A	well
B	well
A	you can
A	ever think about it ever again but
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	have you seen Let Me In?
A	and it's called Let Me In?
B	um um yes it's it's a it's an American remake on Let Me In it's an American remake of the Swedish film which has the title um Let The Right One In
A	oh right
B	which is
A	mm
B	the basic premise being that a vampire can't enter your house unless you invite them in
A	which I know because I watched one episode of Being Human ever
B	I haven't seen that
B	bBC3 isn't it? Yeah
A	it wasn't bad with one er from that one episode
B	mm
A	but er I'm not gonna get into it
A	anyway
B	mm
A	hm
B	no it's
A	another one
B	I won't spoil it
A	right
B	it's a
A	film
B	film rather than
A	film
B	yeah but it's um
A	okay
B	it's er apparently it's an almost if you er well I've we I've only seen the American one
A	oh that's good
B	so
A	american remakes
A	mm
B	slash Peter
A	oh yeah
B	english people won't either
A	there's no problem with subtitles
B	mm
A	I totally
B	I don't get the
A	I totally forgot that I was reading subtitles when I saw Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
B	I think
A	you notice it for the first
B	yeah
A	thirty seconds
B	mm
A	you just take it in
B	yeah
A	as speech
B	exactly
A	mm
B	I think there's associations of work
A	depends how easily you can read
A	I suppose
B	yeah
B	if you're watching subtitles in a language other than your own then yes it's probably quite difficult
A	yeah
B	oo
A	it's sometimes helpful to have German subtitles
A	my my dad definitely finds it helpful having subtitles
B	oh
A	watching German films
B	right
A	Cos er
A	cos
B	mm
A	catch the words
B	it's easier to to read than er
A	than yeah
B	mm
A	you can see the separate words
B	yeah
A	mm
B	or
A	mm
B	is your dad like fluent in German then or? Er you know is it kind of
A	no
B	right
A	um
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but he's never
B	yeah
A	Cos that requires a bit more
B	mm
A	be used to putting the words in the right order
A	understanding it
B	mm
A	doesn't require that
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	um doing German classes
B	oh that's really cool
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	so they met in England then?
A	no
B	oh
A	they met in Scotland
B	right
B	um
A	they met on the Isle of Arran
B	very nice  very nice
A	um
B	mm
A	HF Holidays
B	mm
A	so
B	you did tell me that
A	I've told you about HF stands for husband found
A	apparent because it's happened so many times
B	that's really nice
A	and mm
B	well I guess it makes sense
A	yeah
B	you already have something you like
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so
B	that's interesting
B	I wonder what the correlation is
A	mm
B	I think I've had enough sandwich
A	mm
B	mm
B	yeah
B	mm
A	better than my afternoon snack
B	I am I'm  I'm
A	from the vending machine
B	mm I'm fond of a Twix at three o'clock
A	mhm
B	twix and coffee
A	hm
B	very good
A	what I should do more often is just um go up to the little kitchen area on the third floor where the vending machine is
B	mhm
A	sit down on the little mini sofa
B	mhm
A	just have a
B	have a coffee break
A	quarter of an hour
B	very good idea
A	the first  the first  floor kitchen is is not so great
B	mm
A	onto the  onto the  aisle
B	mhm
A	whereas the third floor kitchen is enclosed
B	yeah
A	and there's a
B	yeah
A	but er
B	well
A	mm
B	they have a half hour longer standard day which includes two fifteen minute breaks
A	yeah
B	hm
A	um
B	mm
B	nice
A	yeah
A	breaks because someone has to cover for her at the desk when she
B	right
A	goes up to have a coffee
A	or whatever
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	mm
B	on the er on the eyes
A	mm
B	mm
A	you can really
B	rowing hands
A	you can
B	yeah
A	due to rowing can't you?
B	you really can
A	yeah
B	I wonder how long it takes to disappear
A	probably not the most attractive
B	you look
A	well it takes a long time to disappear I think
B	yeah
B	mm
A	pretty much there
B	wow
B	you can pretend to be like a a labourer
A	mm
A	mm
B	watering something probably
B	or playing tea-shops
A	urgh
A	Don't drink that
A	mm
B	and um er you know like when they were finished there'd be a bit of tea left
A	yeah
B	and my sister would always just make like concoctions
A	mm
B	and then try and get a parent to drink it
A	sorry?
B	I'm quite excited for her coming
A	huh
B	huh
A	got a text from
B	oh yeah
A	is she?
B	mm
A	is he?
B	he's he is
B	I think the
A	ah
B	um
B	why?
A	hm?
B	why?
A	why? Er
A	no
B	she's very hard to pin down
A	yes
B	is she er she's er is she alright in the text?
A	er
B	she sort of hinted saying I
A	yeah
B	mm
A	just this bright outside
B	what? From Skyping?
A	no
B	huh? Where are you pointing?
A	look
B	oh
A	that
B	oh a photo on his desk?
A	someone who must must be his daughter on his desk who's got
B	oh
A	which prompted me to text her
A	that's about it
B	and it sorry I didn't read her reply
A	oh
B	I
A	oh
B	hm
A	right
A	mm
B	I love the little Android
A	ta
B	android smilies
A	yeah
B	nice
A	so
B	that's good
A	um
B	well
A	she's alive
B	positive noises anyway
A	that's good
B	mm
A	mm
B	it's a bit awkward
A	no
B	sort of not
A	yeah
B	mm
A	chatted chatted
B	yeah
A	um she said something about
A	I dunno
B	mm
A	I dunno if this is er it's at all related to what she might've been hinting at to you
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	well
B	I dunno
A	mm
B	I hope she's talked to somebody about it anyway
A	whatever it is
B	yeah
A	maybe
A	yeah
B	he was er he was
A	mm
B	mm
A	where was it in Scotland that he was on about?
B	um
A	where where what what was the name of the place he was on about?
B	lochside Cottages
A	it was a name beginning with a T
B	oh
B	that's the one
A	oh that's a
B	yeah
A	oh I was just thinking cos er the place my brother's going
B	mm
A	it's it's Torridon
B	mm
A	in
B	in Scotland is it?
A	Scotland
B	right
A	it's um pretty much directly west of Inverness
B	mm
A	so is? I get the impression
B	um
A	okay
B	not particularly
A	just the ones that I've seen
B	I think well the ones in Scotland where we've been before which are really nice
A	mm
B	um
A	where in Wales then?
B	sort of mid-Wales
B	um it's kind of exactly half-way up the the coast
A	right
B	mm
A	that sounds flat
B	um
A	then again it's coast
B	I was gonna say there's there's lots of beaches
A	ah cliffs cliffs
B	and yes er there's er um
A	there need to be cliffs
A	little what?
B	ponies
A	mm
B	so like little Shetland horses
A	how little?
A	near er
A	where we  where we  did all the er walk on the first day in tut in er Glencoe um yeah we came across a field that had two horses in it
B	right
A	one which was a small horse
B	aw
A	it was like this big
B	I love tiny horses
B	they weren't that small but they're so cute
A	yeah
B	aw
A	it was amazing
B	aw
A	I think it must have been a young one
B	mm
A	it but it it was er
B	like a baby Shetland or something?
A	it wasn't
B	or smaller?
A	yeah I mean it wasn't like it was extremely young
B	mhm
A	it was just probably quite young
B	mm
A	I don't think they'd let you
B	not if I was like heavier than it
B	bit harsh
A	A noble steed
A	oh God
B	in er Shrek
A	yeah
A	no
B	just so good
A	oh you've not got er sensible internet
B	yeah
A	still?
B	no word
A	I
B	sort of nearly finished the road though
A	I wanna stay here
B	yeah
A	got sunstroke
A	mm
B	mm
A	I really wanna during the summer have some way in which I can just come to the garden and work
B	you did discuss it as part of the employment well-being scheme
A	yeah
B	so it should be outdoors
A	I mean even in the blazing sun it will probably be cooler here than in my office
A	Cos it's horrible
B	you see mine's er really cold
A	there's no air conditioning
B	oo
A	which I'd be fine with I mean um I'm not pro air conditioning
A	you've got a building that won't heat up like a greenhouse
B	ah
A	mm
B	can't be doing with this
A	sweat patches
A	yeah I know
B	hm
A	no I didn't actually
B	oh that's alright then
B	I wasn't terribly concerned
A	mm
B	actually though we are moving across the road um like next month
A	oh right
B	um which I'm not massively excited about
A	oh that's nice
B	it's gonna be tulips
A	yeah
B	attached to where I sit
A	I'm fairly attached to where I sit
B	nice
A	um
B	yeah
A	I mean I can look out of a window
B	mm
A	my desk
B	yeah
A	ah
B	also known as by the window
A	mm
B	so I'm kind of got my fingers crossed for that
B	ah
A	I should've worn a black shirt
B	A what shirt?
A	I should've worn a black shirt
A	my legs are heating up more than my body
B	uh
A	hm
B	quite loud
A	er authoritative
B	yeah
A	murmurings
B	oh you did tell me this
A	in like several years
B	er leaving the outside up but stripping it
A	well not necessarily even the outside
B	or completely
A	they're just leaving the structural elements
B	oh okay
A	or whatever
B	right
A	um
B	yeah
A	which means a
B	if er yeah
A	but
B	if it's wider and shorter then yeah
A	the idea would be to basically make it all new energy-efficient et cetera  et cetera
B	yeah
A	and it would be they'd add a floor on the top
B	right
A	basically
B	right
A	um
B	with just
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	and you could get all of Mott's staff into that one building rather than split across three buildings
B	oh okay
A	um
B	what just like are they further down the road or something do you mean or?
A	well there's we've got one floor in twenty Station Road
A	and we've got er it's not quite so comparable but
B	yes
A	you know where the steps up
B	yes
A	next to the roundabout?
B	yeah
A	er we've er got all of that
B	oh
A	with the er buildings and infrastructure and health and education units
B	aha
A	um
B	isn't
A	not
B	is it not?
A	it's
B	oh right
A	which is the education division of
A	so
A	but it's been er it it's now part of
B	right
A	um
B	so it's probably connected to
A	I'm not sure
A	I might have to
B	I can't remember
A	wikipedia it
B	yeah
A	or something
B	there might be no connection at all
A	mm
B	I suppose
A	but yeah
B	mm
A	will get around to implementing that plan
B	where will you all go?
A	I don't know
B	Cos that's the  that's the  kind of
A	temporary locations
B	yeah
A	they'll like probably have to cram more of us into
B	yeah
A	space
A	um
B	mm
A	find somewhere temporary
B	yeah
A	work from home?
B	I was just about to say yeah
A	mm
B	that'd be good
A	um
A	and for that long might present some problems
B	mm
A	dunno
B	yeah
A	mm
B	or you could have er
A	but er
B	you could have er sort of um like
A	yeah
B	which I think is maybe the easiest way
A	yeah
B	hm
A	and then it'll probably er take about a year for them to do it
B	yeah
A	and we'd have a brand new fancy building
B	yeah
A	even though that rent would be then higher because it's higher value
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	if it's er you know all jazzy and shiny and new would
A	yeah
B	presumably it's gonna save money in the long run
A	yeah
A	fixed the windows
A	and that kind of thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	stop throwing money away
A	because this might be on the horizon that they're not prioritizing small
B	yeah
A	like replacing carpet tiles
A	or
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and twenty-five
A	yeah
B	it got manky
A	but
B	yeah
A	have you seen it?
B	I've been in  I've been in  one of them
