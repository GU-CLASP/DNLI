A	well cheers old chap
B	cheers
A	your wealth
B	your stealth
B	my penis
A	well I wouldn't go so far as to say that
B	no I could go here and say it
B	I know I know
A	well I could put a wig on and put some lipstick on if that'll help
B	yeah
A	oh
B	and
A	psychiatrist almost
B	erm
A	therapy
B	well counselling is a something a skill that we all had once and we've lost we gave it away due to manners and civility and I mean I still think you need to have manners because it's in the society and they're all different according to different societies
A	absolutely
B	erm but
A	uhu
B	and erm that's interesting to to look into I I I find that fascinating and then we the
A	yeah
B	we should be taught how to counsel each other
A	do you think kids could handle it though?
B	yes I think they're the they know it's they know it's the right way
A	instinctively
B	instinctively yes
A	impulse is an immediate reaction
B	right
A	and
B	reaction?
A	yeah
B	right
A	I mean and and I
B	yes
A	and you do it on the spur of the moment
B	of course
A	it's not pre planned
B	oh
A	you do something on impulse you do it oh I fancy that I'll do it
B	yeah
A	I mean instinct is something that erm is intrinsic I think in us that probably is passed down through our DNA somehow
B	yes
A	when a an animal is born very often or depending on the species of course it can get up and start walking immediately
B	yes
A	by instinct
B	they say a lot of it was well someone said to me once and I tend to agree with them and it may be a column I'm sure there have been loads of millions of books written on it but breakdowns
A	mm
A	dogma
B	dogma and er all these bloody things yeah but the
A	so where did you think in that
B	er well I think a man gets to a time when
A	mm
B	and er
A	mm
B	I'll do this then and er and the forces that be or the way that things go say that money is always the factor you know
A	yeah
A	but it's being separated isn't it? from er his er mystical element to just getting out of your mind but without any specific purpose other than to get out of your mind
B	yeah
A	I was thinking in particular remember Carlos Castaneda's books?
B	oh right er what was the book called?
A	oh I think he did several I can't remember
B	yes
A	a particular one at the moment
B	yeah like but
A	mm better late than never
B	yeah but again it's been by capitalists to make money if you look all all the all the erm it's the way that the Americans have now legalised cannabis A you've got to have a medical condition to be able to warrant your possession of it and usage of it
A	mm
B	and probably B growing it is still illegal so
A	yeah
B	again they they they again the er the means of production
A	they wanna control the means of production yeah
B	has been taken away from the workers you know
A	mm
B	as everything you
A	yeah
B	from people
B	we have to pay for everything even water
A	yeah
B	and this is the big thing going on in third world countries now that er people like Coca-Cola are moving their plants to India where they have only a limited amount of water and the ground water now is polluted by what Coca-Cola does and the products that Coca-Cola make instead of being drunk but the local
A	mm
B	all the animals are farmed in buildings pigs the cattle
A	yes I think we we were lucky in our generation to to have been born when we were cos I wouldn't like to be growing up now
B	no
B	yes
B	oh
A	me
B	what's your take on it?
A	well I think most of what you've said is absolutely true
B	that's
A	oh yeah?
B	after he mentioned what if you remember he mentioned what happened after the black death
A	I don't think I was watching it
B	yeah you watched it
A	did I?
B	sat there and watched how the how the peasants were treated and
A	oh right yeah
B	and one thing he you know what they could do to serfs they serfs you worked for the person and that was it for the rest of your life and er
A	mm
B	you were enslaved to them basically you couldn't say well I don't want to work on your land anymore you couldn't do that you er your children were
A	oh
B	so then
A	mm
B	and the ones who haven't got money
A	mm
B	which is becoming the greater amount of people in the country
A	mm
B	even the middle class there are suffering so he's erm er er so he was talking about England and I would imagine America that erm the er being a democracy it doesn't count for anything because they're not making the laws that benefit the people of the country
A	mm
B	you know the country and the government should be there to benefit the people
A	mm
B	not just the privileged few
A	mm
B	or the bankers
A	that's just a
B	well
A	big business
B	mm he's great to listen to Noam Chomsky
A	yeah oh he is
B	I think he's Jewish isn't he?
A	yeah
B	yeah a good
A	mm
B	is just get rid of it if it bomb the lot of it
B	well
A	and they don't
B	Israel's been experimenting with dirty bombs
A	yeah
B	have you seen that?
A	yeah I saw that the other night
B	they've they've tested about five or six dirty bombs so they let go of a dirty bomb and then they go and see what what it's caused what damage it's caused and so I suppose that information could be used in several ways one way is what damage you can inflict on your enemy
A	mm
B	Pakistan's got some I think
A	mm
B	but erm oh yeah how do we attempt to clean up? or how do we
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	well I wish I was
B	well
B	it's only they say
A	yeah mm
B	well you've got an idea of the principles haven't you?
A	yeah
B	I do this you do that
A	mm
B	that's what life is isn't it? or conflict
A	mm
B	you were playing yesterday
A	no I was just studying
B	oh right
A	I did I I gave up for eight months
B	yeah
A	a couple of years ago and erm
B	right
A	so
B	is that strange? I suppose the the mind must process it all
A	mm
B	all the info and
A	yeah
B	they say you can ask your mind a question
A	yeah?
B	well if I can't remember something I think right I'll think on that
A	mm sleep on it
B	and I just I I don't even consciously do it I put I say I'll think on that I'll think on that I'll try and see if I can remember and it goes in there and bugger me quite often nine times out of ten I think
A	mm
B	or even more the the answer comes out
A	mm
B	it's er you know trusting in the subconscious unconscious? I don't know
A	the universe
B	god it might be all a bit weirder than we imagine
A	yeah a lot of people believe we have to unlearn everything before we start learning
B	mm
A	I don't feel like it no
B	okay
A	but thank you for
B	that's alright
