A	so do you want to know what was said at parents evening?
B	yes
A	yeah?
B	erm
A	more more grown up really so he said you're very sensible and you can be relied upon to be sensible and make others around you work hard
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I am left-handed which means I'm
A	I know and he knows and I I am also left-handed but that's really good so
C	mm hm
A	she says you find it you know you haven't quite decided the best way to work things out so you're always a little bit concerned but she said that'll be fine you'll come on no problems at all and that she loved how much you liked studying George Stevenson
A	whatever his name is
B	although the only reason I learnt how to get quite good at maths
A	mm
B	is experimenting with different ways of how to work things out and then saw which one was the easiest
A	mm
B	yeah
A	is that because it's
B	yeah and pressure
A	oh the pressure
B	cos sometimes erm we do big maths first and other times we do forty-four club and a hundred forty-four club
A	mm hm
B	and I'm quite shaken up after the stress of a hundred and forty-four club
A	is that the times table thing?
B	erm yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I know but if you practice them you'll get a bit better
B	after all the way home
A	mm and he was also saying that you
B	mm hm
A	mm
C	yeah well
A	are you pleased?
C	the reason why I'm struggling with maths
A	mm
C	I'd need to I need to like get a hint on the answer and
A	get a what? a hint?
C	on the answer and do you know what? I'm really bad at kind of division or something
A	mm

A	mm
C	and I'm really
A	at fractions yes
C	yeah
A	me too
C	it's like I say eleven can you subtract that?
A	mm hm
C	so erm
A	oh okay
C	and basically I basically got one
A	mm
C	and
A	that was a twelve?
C	yeah I got one eleven and the others were twelve
A	okay
C	me too
B	hey mum shall I tell you what the word of the week was this spelling erm
A	yeah who chose it? first tell me that
B	erm I'm not sure but it was Mississippi
A	that was
C	no
A	I can't remember now they said it on your hand out
B	and I got it right
A	oh in the test?
B	I got
A	cos cos you didn't in homework so that's good
B	yeah I got twenty out of twenty I think
A	yes Mr
B	yeah
A	so that's good
B	I don't usually spell words wrong in my like in writing
A	mm
C	like like like like this
A	mm hm
B	yeah Geronimo I would find quite tricky
A	and spelling is something you're working towards as well

A	I could take you out for a special breakfast at some point
C	the pub which we loved the breakfast I mean the
A	the

A	it would be an amazing afternoon
A	I could do it I reckon I could do that
C	I don't know
A	hm?
C	you could steal all the chocolate bunnies
A	I could break in at night and steal it
A	or I could sneakily eat it but then fill it out with bits of cardboard so people don't don't think anyone's eaten it
C	or mud
A	or mud oh that would be very mean
