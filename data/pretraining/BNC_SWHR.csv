A	so you got a new laptop?
B	yeah I'm really pleased about this laptop cos I've never had one before
A	what a laptop?
B	no I've never owned a laptop only had a static computer
A	oh like a desktop
B	mm mm
A	and the so what what what prompted you?
B	well it's
A	mm
B	that was only a year old so
C	but you first came round to wanting a laptop cos you had a purpose you were trying to get a presentation ready
A	ah ah yeah that's
B	yes yes for the talk
A	after doing the presentation yeah so
B	yeah
A	you found you couldn't live without it
B	well now I'm yeah I want I decided erm well I I'm trying to write and I find writing on the laptop once I've formulated a few ideas rather than just writing longhand I find it really good to just to to
A	yeah cos you can go back and edit stuff and
B	yeah dead easy it's dead easy erm so
A	still it's not as difficult to use as
B	no
B	I've got to just get the fingerprints off it and sort of tidy it up a bit and but it's not that was very difficult
A	yeah yeah I think you just I think he wished he hadn't bought it
B	yeah he does
A	oh well and you're still plugging away with the Linux one?
C	I am yeah yeah I like er using Linux cos it's erm a bit different and erm it's not Microsoft
C	which is a
A	you're not losing any money to Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or
C	yeah
A	and of these
C	and what I found with these er new laptops and er Windows is that they are trying to extract information from you all the time if you notice that erm
A	yeah
C	they're taking information off you that's why I don't like so
A	yeah I get the same with my phone
A	it's always saying you know data will be
B	yes I don't like that
A	it is a bit worrying but I I think you can there's a lot of things you can click so it's not doing that I think that you just actually need to spend the time but yeah since I've started using that Linux laptop I'm very happy
C	right right
A	the only problem is
A	er
C	yes
A	and er it's just the one that came with that
B	is that similar to Open Office?
C	it is an Open Office programme yeah
A	yeah they're all a much of a muchness really
C	mm
A	erm but it's definitely good cos now and again you get something that you can't do that perhaps a a normal laptop could do but there's not much
C	mm
A	and if you spend a bit of time finding out about it it's not bad
C	the other thing about Linux is if you erm need to fix something it is a lot harder than
A	there is a greatest sense of achievement isn't there?
C	there is yeah
B	why's it harder?
C	er sometimes er well it's not so good at automatically installing things
A	mm
C	so you have to find a programme install it and find the right place to install it it's getting better erm the other thing is that sometimes if you need to fix things you actually have to enter lines of code so remember on my computer the brightness control doesn't work automatically
B	mm mm
C	I have to put in a small line of code I had to find on the internet cos
B	right
C	I can't code in Unix so
B	in Unix?
C	Unix is
A	the language of the operating system
C	the language of the operating system yeah
A	but it's nice that you get there's a sense of achievement it's like being able to change the oil in your car or something like that
C	yeah that's right mm
A	if you can do it erm it's kind of
B	well what happened was he the house got broken into and
C	your friend's house
B	a friend's house about a year and a half ago
A	and you've got a laptop from them
A	right okay it all becomes clear
B	and erm the insurance paid for a you know a replacement
A	ah yeah
B	and erm so I was just saying I didn't want a computer with Windows eight on it like
A	yes
B	and erm so
A	wow
C	yes yes
B	yeah oh it's fantastic er it's really fast
C	and the reviews are really good yeah five star reviews
A	what brand is it?
B	it's Samsung
B	yeah yeah
A	good
B	and it's so after using
A	the touchpad
B	I mean
A	yeah it had that bumpy kind of
B	and this one is so smooth
C	yeah
B	and
A	it's very unnatural
B	yeah
C	yeah it's
B	whereas this one is so smooth it's it's fantastic
A	good
B	erm so going to buy
A	mm I need to yeah I need to think about getting my old laptop I've got a big one as well that little Linux the white one I've got is good but I've got a big laptop sitting there and that's only a year year and a bit old and that's the one that got broken the hard disk
C	ah
A	it's dead so it would need a new hard disc hard drive? hard disc? is it the same thing?
C	I think it's the same thing
A	yeah I need a new one fitted a brand new one fitted and an operating system put on it again so that would probably cost about a hundred and fifty pounds so
C	it's getting to the realms now where it's almost as easy to buy a new one isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
C	erm like my computer if I was to replace it it would cost about two hundred pounds so there's almost no point me er
C	mm
A	you know for
C	what brought you to Linux then?
B	he doesn't use it do you use Linux?
A	it's free
C	yeah
B	I didn't realise you used Linux
A	yeah yeah on that little white laptop we've got
B	oh right
A	erm because that had Windows on it when I bought it from
C	mm
A	and then I had it as a
C	ah
A	erm there's nothing that it doesn't do that I want it to do
C	really?
A	yeah
B	do you know Linux do you know what Linux
C	I don't no I use
A	I I just like the name
B	sounds cool
A	yeah Linux
A	yeah some some things not everything but I don't know it's good and it's it's you know
C	and the thing about it is that it is erm an older it's based on an older operating system but it was coded properly from the beginning and like you say your computer was struggling with the latest version
A	yeah
C	of Windows but this operating system which is more sophisticated because it is more efficient it actually works better
A	yeah
C	uhu even on a
A	I've not had any problems with it it's not frozen or crashed or anything like that I did try to install an update and it wasn't happy with that so I just went back and uninstalled it and it was happy again so I I don't know enough about them and I don't have enough I don't care enough about them
B	mm
A	so you just want it to work erm
C	mm
A	I'm gonna buy a new Ipad so
B	oh yeah when do you start your job?
A	I have
B	oh you have started?
A	yeah yeah
B	oh right
A	well I've I've been
B	oh yes you would have by now
A	well no I've been going in in the afternoons when I don't when I've not been teaching
B	mm mm
A	just to kind of get up to speed and also cos my boss had a lot to run through with me
B	right
A	so he wanted to get me up to speed
B	uhu
A	before that so erm
B	oh so is it looking positive?
A	yeah yeah hard work but positive
B	right good
A	tried to recruit a trying to recruit a few teachers at the moment but one one she's perfect she
A	and of course what happens? she got poached by another school and we offered her a more permanent contract
C	oh right
A	but erm ah these things happen
B	mm
C	mm
A	but er no going back to your computer erm you've got no excuse now not to use
B	yes ah right
C	what's Prezi?
B	Prezi is this erm er I've only see a week bit erm
C	oh yeah
B	from what I gather a sort of linear slide presentation it's a bit like going into some kind of memory board or something
C	oh right
A	mm
B	and being able to go into different bits it's more three dimensional
A	yeah but more dynamic than than erm
B	erm
A	than Powerpoint
B	yeah
C	and is that erm a
A	no the
C	mm mm
A	and I think the free version you can do almost anything with it erm I used it given I mean I did workshops in China for for teachers and
B	mm mm
A	which is nice and because it
C	does it work on the Windows?
A	it works on all the platforms I think
C	mm mm
A	erm cos it's web based
C	oh I see
A	erm
C	right
A	but you can pay for it and have it locally
C	oh I see
A	erm
C	so if it's web based where do you store your presentation?
A	on on on in the cloud
B	in the cloud
C	right
A	in the cloud sounds so threatening doesn't it? but erm
C	so it's a bit like a Dropbox system? where you can store your stuff
A	yeah
C	er on another server
A	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	before they sort of cap it
C	mm
B	right
A	erm and for things like phones and Ipads there's actually a
C	mm mm
A	so you it's more visually oriented
B	mm mm
A	which I think presentations should be cos the
B	mm
A	you know the if they're gonna be sitting reading something it's a bit of a waste of time isn't it?
B	mm mm
C	mm
A	to be to be presenting it so we'll see
B	oh yeah if you wanna come I'm giving a talk on the first of March
A	first of March what day is that?
B	Sunday
A	Sunday?
B	Sunday afternoon
A	yeah
B	if you wanna come
A	yeah that'll be good then you've got your new laptop now
A	so you can do it was confidence
B	absolutely
A	sounds good
