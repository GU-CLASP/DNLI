A	don't bitch about me please?
C	mm
D	look at these
B	I'm gonna kill one of these jelly
D	see you
C	oh man that movie
D	that movie
B	the alpaca
D	those alpacas they were pretty great
C	I wanna find that scene and just replay it
D	it was so good cos it was like a serious moment and then suddenly the alpaca was yeah
C	I feel like they were trying to be so artistic and like maybe originally the film was six hours long and they had to cut it down which is why it didn't make any sense
B	well I think it there were there were like there was potential in there for quite like good stuff
C	mm there were some interesting shots
B	there was some good scare bits as well but
D	yeah
B	they clearly had an atrocious budget
C	mm
D	mm
B	because bless that poor girl who was acting she wasn't very good
C	no I did think I was like
D	at the beginning
C	if that was me I'd feel so silly
D	I was like I was like I can do better than this like seriously
C	I bet you could
D	she was like what was she doing?
D	like at some points it was like okay that's fine that's fine
B	and when she was seventeen
D	it was like you know the beginning?
C	was she?
D	at the beginning that just that just
B	no I missed the beginning
D	oh my god but that just felt so fake when she was talking with her boyfriend
C	oh yeah it was so lame
D	the
B	I only saw him when he was dead I don't remember him alive
D	I thought she'd got like I thought she'd got much better like at you know
B	yeah
D	when she was supposed to be scared and stuff
B	I think hysterical terrors probably easier to play
C	yeah
D	maybe
C	I thought like the mum was like thirty it was so unconvincing
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	she was like mum
B	I was like who is this person?
B	the exploding pumpkin minefield as well
C	that yeah it's like etched in my memory I'll never forget that
D	yeah
D	it just that can't be
C	so what do you think she like
D	the explanation
C	cut the baby out of her and then she what happened
D	wait why she did it?
C	sorry?
D	why or how?
C	I mean what do you think happened?
B	I think it was meant to be like have you ever seen The Descent?
C	mm mm
B	it's erm it's a horror movie and it it's not bad it's alright but like they go underground and like do you mind if I give away the last scene?
C	mm
B	erm basically she has been trying to get out of this place like they're right right right underground and they've been trying to find the way out and she's the only one left alive and there's are all these like weird like humanoid things that have been living down there so long they've just evolved into cannibalistic like creepy things and erm the end scene is her like finally like finding like finding a crack where there's daylight and like
C	mm mm
B	rubbing the stones away and like getting out and then erm she wakes up and she's still in the pit
C	it's all a
B	and it's just like she's basically just like
D	oh
B	hallucinated getting out because I can't remember why you hallucinate down there but you start hallucinating I think maybe because of the oxygen or something but erm and it felt a bit like that you know that where there was like can you hear me Dora?
B	like that I think that was like the recurring
C	oh horror film
B	because it was filmed really trippy which was why I genuinely I'm not sure if she was pregnant cos I think it would have been quite a good twist if she was never pregnant just like hacked herself open and woke up in hospital erm
D	mm hacked herself
C	mm
D	I can't help but think
B	promiscuity
D	on abortion
C	oh yeah thinly veiled
D	you know on on yes exactly on abortion on like
B	and alpacas
D	teenage pregnancy killer alpacas
D	the danger of pumpkins
C	mm yeah do not carve pumpkin children
B	do not use gunpowder instead of candles guys
D	mm
D	oh my god these are really good
B	mm mm
B	I stole one of the only two muffins I'm sorry
C	oh no
D	that's okay
B	instead I'm not really sorry because it's really good
C	I'm all about the party rooms and the jelly babies
D	oh is that what these are?
D	I had no idea what a jelly baby was
B	ah
D	oh my god that's really creepy they're just shaped like babies
B	these are like the original ones
C	mm
D	edible babies
C	got to eat them head first
B	yeah surely that should be illegal now?
B	I just mean you know the way like now they don't sell those little like fake cigarette sweets any more
D	oh my god there are
B	cos it encourages you to smoke yeah I've not seen them in years like the chocolate ones with the rice paper round the outside that actually look
D	yeah
B	like cigarettes like
B	you know it encourages you to smoke this makes cannibalism cool
C	I am cool with that
D	September
B	I've never sat in one of these meeting rooms I really do want the giraffe head to appear
