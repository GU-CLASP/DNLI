A	I'll break this one off
B	so do you want to talk to tell us about the
A	it was fun and a bit sad because at first it was quite fun we put on our helmets
B	hang on don't talk really fast
A	and then we went on some
B	around some cones
A	we went on the cones
B	you went on the cones oh
A	yes we before we even went to the bikes
B	why did you go on the cones?
A	because we needed to warm up
B	oh
A	which was quite fun and then they said we could we needed to touch the bottom of on the on the blue cone and I thought which one there's two
B	right
A	but they said the first one
B	they said the first one
A	and they said the closest one
B	to you
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	and I did that and then they said and then they said we can make it a bit harder by touching both by touching both sides on the cone
B	mm
A	with our hands
B	okay
A	I thought that was quite cool
B	mm
A	can I have my rod please?
B	can you have your what? yes
A	and then after that we went on a bike we went to the bikes and what else?
B	mm
A	yeah we erm we got to lift them up by bending our knees and grabbing the handlebars
B	can you need to speak clearly dear
A	we erm went to them and we didn't touch them until we were told and then we had to bend down on our knees grab them get them hold them upright and try to hold them steady then we had a go of walking them down I wasn't good at that my was wobbly
B	in a special way
A	yeah and it was very heavy it was quite heavy for me
B	mm
A	no they were all the same colour
B	what colour were they?
A	black with green stripes
B	right put your hand away from your mouth black with green stripes
A	erm they were black with the grips with a green stripe saying something so was the helmets and so was erm and they had like this little sash on the on the handlebars and mum and then we did then we got to go on them these huge gigantic steps I was wobbling a bit I was left behind the front and the back I can't we were like
B	mm
A	yeah we were like this
B	no can you sit down come on
A	and erm
B	was that when you fell over?
A	no
B	okay
A	that was on and
B	but you did that okay?
A	and then it was after that we did the tiny mouse steps it was and then we were trying to and then for a challenge we were trying to see how they they made us try to see how far we could go lifting our legs up erm that's and then I went downwards and I was quite good at that and there's a bit of a slope down the playground it goes like this and we still don't want to and then when we went upwards on the slope kind of bit I fell off
B	ah
A	and I didn't feel very proud of myself afterwards
B	you must don't tap that there you must
C	it goes like that
B	listen people that are successful get successful because they've tried hard and they've failed at something and then they've carried on and worked hard and succeeded so that's what you are doing
A	and when I fell over I just got on er they asked me if I was okay and I said I think so and I carried on
B	oh baby
A	but there wasn't a bit there was a bit more to go and then I and the people in the class they were just busy looking at us
B	I know and that's not very nice is it
A	yeah and they were like and it's really

B	I don't know because it's gonna be sent off to be marked but the questions were good
C	what do you mean like hard?
B	no they were ones that I knew that they they should be able to do if they've timed it properly and everything I felt that they were well prepared for those
C	because of you?
B	mm I guess so
C	I would think so too
B	mm
C	so they need to like
B	sit down please well they it's not just reading the questions they need to understand them and be able to answer in in a lot of detail
C	is it like adding and subtracting and times and dividing or?

A	she said I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna be I'm gonna have homeschool
C	forever?
A	yeah until we go to college
B	I don't really understand why though
A	I don't know
B	well baby she's your friend
A	I know
B	are you not going to ask her?
A	I'll ask her
B	because that would be
C	I really really want to go to his house
B	yeah but you are not going you are not going to go to his house because you haven't been invited because this is a
C	what if it rains?
B	they've got a plastic sheet over it now
A	mm
C	what if it thunders? what if a lightning bolt strikes the roof?
B	well I think we'd all be in trouble if that that happened but
C	what are we doing?
B	well for
C	it wouldn't be bad at all
B	well it depend if it was like a roasting hot day it would be okay wouldn't it but this is although it's spring it's still very icy outside
C	mm
B	mm
C	in the summer I don't think I'm actually going to need a blanket
B	no well that's why you still have your baby blanket so they're the lightest blanket you can have the thing is I don't ever sleep well in the summer because I like to have a quilt I like to be all snuggly and I find it very difficult to sleep without one even if it's really hot I still try and have a quilt
C	me to
B	no we've got like we've got an autumn quilt and a spring quilt which we put
A	freezing
B	well I yeah I
A	there was hardly any water
B	no I mean swimming pool
A	yeah
B	you can keep cool that way
C	I was normally next to water
B	sorry
C	I was normally next to water and if not I'd probably be inside water
B	mm
A	er mama I saw this like thing on another house it was like a pool with a waterfall going into another bit and erm you could get out the other bit to the so if you like fell down that bit you couldn't get out yeah because the waterfall was going down
B	oh wow
A	into a pool
B	into a pool that seems was it meant for people to go in there?
A	I don't know
B	that seems a bit of a silly design
A	because I saw a house across
B	how nice was it a man-made waterfall presumably someone built it?
A	yeah it was basically like erm towers
B	like the one in Legoland ah
A	it just goes down down down down down
B	okay but in someone's house that's pretty cool
A	outside
B	well yes that would be less cool inside I think
C	mum?
B	yes
A	you are allowed two
C	why do people die if they fall down a waterfall?
B	well they don't necessarily die but it's a long way to fall so they tend to hit their head on something
A	yeah and it has erm the and it has rapids you are basically like has really
C	no the rapids are before the waterfall
B	the rapids are before the waterfall it
C	I may have like erm I nearly broke my arm when I fell when I did a face plant into the water from the three metre
B	well you didn't nearly break your arm but it does hurt doesn't it?
C	yeah a huge amount
B	it does hurt yes it's surprising how much getting landing in the water badly can really hurt
C	yeah but if you point your feet and you land down straight as long as there's no jaggedy rocks at the bottom and it's quite and it's deep enough then you will survive
B	but the problem with a waterfall is that that you know you are in water you are not leaping into water you are in water already and it's pushing you around and you probably don't know where you are going you can't see anything so you can't right yourself and get yourself into a position
B	you might do but I just think it's very dangerous and they they can be very big drops can't they?
C	yeah
B	very big but you know if you can you can be lucky
C	in my It Can't be True in my It Can't be True book there's a gigantic waterfall that is like much taller than er which is taller than about five Leaning Tower of Pisa's
B	uhu
C	I don't know shall I get it?
B	not yet I wonder if it's in America like the Amazon or something
A	or or Japan
B	I think Japan have
A	mum do you know what a boy called
B	mm
A	yeah and he and
B	mm
C	Janpan
B	oh but he's only in year one
A	and
B	and what did he say?
A	he was like
B	oh oh he was obviously trying to impress you with a tale
A	yeah
B	oh that's very sweet isn't it
B	that's very sweet
A	and erm I and then the cat came and er people
B	the school cat
A	yeah and loads of people wanted to stroke it but I thought no you don't know where it's been and it might not like children because once it scratched
B	yes it did scratch
C	well it doesn't it doesn't even belong to the school
B	no it just kind of trots in do you know it was national cat day in Japan yesterday because they love cats so they were celebrating everything to do with cats yesterday

A	once in year two at one time in year two the cat we were in the ICT suite and the cat as there
B	yes
C	well the door was open
B	yeah but it shouldn't be cocky enough to walk in should it because there's lots of cats around here but they don't come into our house and rightly so
A	but you are scared to death
B	I'm not scared of cats but I'm scared of birds so I don't ever want a a cat to come in
C	with a dead bird
B	with a dead bird
