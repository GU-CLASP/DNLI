A	no
D	I don't know
B	probably not
C	what do they do that the diocese can't?
A	well all of that stuff is erm
B	hierarchical

B	yeah
A	the Roman church thrust dioceses and stuff on everybody
B	the bureaucracy
A	mm control

A	yeah
B	yeah there was something in the paper about how people of older generations would never er have got food out on such a a readily basis that we do you know someone comes to your house you just put something on a plate
D	mm mm
B	but in the past people wouldn't do that they wouldn't think of getting food out would they?
C	I would say the opposite
C	I'd say when someone came round you'd make sure that the teapot was ready and you had
A	teapot? yeah
C	cakes and things
B	not just a random visitor
D	they always had
B	people didn't have
D	they always had cakes
A	wasn't it an insult if you if someone came to your house and you didn't offer them a cup of tea?
C	a warm beverage
A	isn't it still?
C	yeah
A	it is slightly
C	where did you read that?
A	yeah or much less anyway
B	think it was The Telegraph
C	been reading that a lot have you lately?
A	I tell you one thing though that's gone the opposite direction
B	what else did I read in The Telegraph?
A	and I was thinking about it when you were talking about going on being one of er what is it?
B	mm
A	for the hen party
A	and I was thinking I remember I think
B	I've never been to one before
A	having a conversation once with you or was er maybe it was even earlier like in the eighties when people were saying how our culture didn't celebrate things properly
B	mm
A	you're like you're drunk for three or four days in a row
D	yes but they go for they go abroad
C	do you remember when we were on a train and we saw one?
A	mm?
D	they go abroad
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's like from
D	Dublin used to be
B	and Prague
A	it's for days and then do you know what I mean? so
B	is it
C	Mexico's Cancún yeah
B	but Cancún and Prague
C	yeah
B	were very in
D	well hens never used to have a party it was just the blokes that went out on the stag night
B	I wonder when hen parties started
C	well do you remember er
D	I don't know
C	what's it called?
C	no Prague
C	he knows all the
C	who's paying for him to go
A	that character what's his name?
C	er no oh
A	do you like lager? I like lager
C	erm who paid for him? we are that's the best thing
A	what's he called though? he's got like a really annoying name
C	yeah
A	oh and he er yeah he's mad or something the one who puts the light out what's he?
B	what are we talking about?
C	oh nuts
A	nuts nutter
B	who's that?
C	and you think it's he's alright nutter and I think it's he's a right nutter
B	what is it?
C	erm oh what's he called?
A	Gavin and Stacey
C	what's he called? the the stag night organiser
B	oh when they go to that er
C	Matt Lucas
B	wedding show

B	oh yes
C	the the the Powerpoint
C	the Powerpoint presentation
B	oh that's funny that is hilarious
B	did you ever watch Gavin and Stacey? oh it was so funny
D	no
A	that's just to say though that hen parties and wedding and stag do's have really come into it haven't they?
B	mm
A	I mean there always was a stag do in a small way
D	mm
A	but it wasn't like
D	mm
A	days and days
B	it's consumerism though isn't it?
A	so I wonder what the next thing's gonna be
B	entrepreneurial business people spot an opportunity don't they?
D	mm mm
C	I think it's more like people want an excuse to have a party
A	yeah
B	well I'm sure that's
D	both both
B	a big part of it
C	are they actual actual trees growing out there?
A	are they actually alive? no
C	no I think I think they're pretend are they?
D	no no I don't think so no
A	this is like a

B	yes
A	I've got rid of all my records
B	will it fit in our car?

D	if somebody can if somebody can lift it out of the shed because it's right at the back
B	is it in a box? or just loose?
D	no
B	just
D	just loose I think
B	what does it look like?
D	I don't know
A	wow
B	mm
D	so it's a huge one
C	do you do you plug it in and then put it into the water? how does it work?
A	what what did you wash it? what did you wash with it?
D	well it was when we were at
B	to sell it?
D	sell what?
B	the house
D	oh yes that was actually it sold very quickly
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	so I'm hoping again
A	yep
D	I'm going to have a look at a flat
B	yeah good location
D	on after Good Friday you know the service
B	next week?
D	this week Good Friday
B	is it open?
D	no no this is one
B	where is it?
D	same place this block's finished this block's been built so she quite likes people to go and have a look
B	oh
D	that's why I'm going just to have a look
B	you know where erm
D	it's up again
B	there's
A	apparently the only trouble with them is there's this bloke plays the bass guitar in er
C	oh they're lovely er properties though aren't they?
B	yeah they are nice
D	well I've never looked
B	well let us know if you want any company to look at anything
B	yeah yeah no I mean in future
D	yes
B	well er I think when you look around for a few months you you find what you don't want if nothing else
D	yes
B	you
D	I might go and get the papers and
B	you start to rule things out
D	but but you won't have any free time to have a look not in this holiday or maybe you will
B	oh yeah maybe yeah next week's not too bad
D	okay
B	yeah just let us know
D	oh
B	just er let us know if you book any appointments
D	it's amazing
B	a comparison and you know that programme? what's it called?
D	I don't watch it
B	where they put a wild card in
D	I think I'd better start watching
C	Escape to the Country
B	Escape to the Country
A	yep yeah
B	they they show they they get
C	mystery house
D	mm
B	and then they they book two
A	yeah
B	to meet what they require and then they throw in a wild card and chances are
C	mystery house
A	it's always a good idea isn't it?
B	they like the mystery house
C	yeah
B	that's why it's good to look at a few
C	it's never very different to the normal houses though is it really?
A	no the mystery house instead of the usual seven bedrooms we're gonna give you what you need
B	no but do you know what I mean? it is worth comparing
D	yes
C	however there is an outbuilding with a possible fifteen bedrooms
B	then you get to spot er bargains as well
A	step this way to walk into an Aesop's fable agreed
D	actually just a thought of okay it's expensive living in
C	it turns out to be
D	that's probably worth that's how my thinking's going at the moment because let's face it I'll start needing certain things and you don't like to burden people and keep asking would you do this and would you do that?
B	well you want you want to minimise any hassle so that you can enjoy yourself
D	definitely to minimise risk
B	yeah
C	what's the library like?
D	I don't know love I haven't seen it yet I ain't seen nothing
C	is it like the library in

C	what? so the library in
B	what do
A	closing down
B	closing down yeah
A	Tories
C	when?
B	it's gonna be just volunteer run
A	soon
C	when when did that come out?
B	probably David Cameron had it top of his list didn't he?
C	yeah I know but no one told me
B	erm
C	and where's it going? yeah I know where's it going?
B	I don't think anything's definite but it was supposed to be going near where the
A	I think it er it's a new development yeah
C	where's that?
A	by the
B	near the doctor's
D	it's where you will be visiting me when you're
B	near the doctor's where
B	near there yeah yeah near there
D	it's where it was yes
C	ah ah oh is that not there any more?
B	it's
C	oh I haven't been round there in a long time
B	we're going to get your check up on Thursday so you'll see it then
C	yeah I had a look into immunotherapy I don't think it's for me
B	oh
D	aromatherapy?
C	immunotherapy cos they either do injections or tablets I'm not having injections cos then they have one a week for three years
B	oh
D	oh come on
B	yeah used to have that
D	oh yes
C	and you take one a week
D	I used to have injections
C	three years
B	yeah I took I did it for three years
C	I'll just have to face that I'll never be able to be a real boy
B	I used to do that for three years
C	I'm a real boy
D	ah so did I
B	but it never worked but it never works anyway does it?
A	you did it for three years?
B	yeah
D	he once gave me the wrong prescriptions
B	and er and then and then there was another thing they said right come two months before the season and have eight weekly injections
A	was it no good?
B	so I tried that no
C	yeah but it'll be better now though to be fair
C	actually maybe mine is
D	the the sprays are better
B	mm
D	I find those sprays are really good
C	I can't be taking sprays every day of my life though
A	nasal sprays?
D	yeah but you can you just sort of couple of squirts at night
C	every day though every day
D	it's just routine like cleaning your teeth
C	it can't be good for you
D	do you do them every day
A	er no
D	ah
C	I'm not taking it cos the one I've got's a steroid I don't want that
B	well you could maybe get a saline one
A	I take the
B	well that's a life-saving thing
D	I was told that was wrong
A	no the brown one
D	oh the brown one that's right yeah but the Ventolin the blue one
A	no
B	no that's just when you need it
A	that's just an inhaler
D	yeah
A	er how often are you taking the antihistamines? is it every day again?
C	no it I should be but it's not I just grin and bear it really
A	so what is it? one every other day?
C	no I rarely take them but to be honest I should do
A	well you you should I mean it is a medicine
B	well we're going to talk to them on Thursday
A	right
D	is it your nose? your throat? or your breathing?
C	yeah yeah nose I think it might be well it's rhinitis so the layer that protects
A	it's got
D	right
C	the snot from coming out is all inflamed
A	do you know what you should try occasionally? Vaseline
B	yes
C	yeah
A	just as just a different
D	I've heard of that
B	yes
A	it does work
B	it really does work
D	it's
C	I've tried it
B	it stops the allergens getting in
A	cos it stops the pollen
C	yeah but I think mine is non-allergic rhinitis
B	ah right well that's what we need to find the root cause
D	is it like?
A	the good news for you is that if you have it in childhood
B	you tend to grow out
A	there's a good chance
B	yeah
C	I don't know if that's true though
A	yeah
B	it is
A	cos I only started getting them when I was about eighteen
B	it is
D	I was eleven when I got mine
B	I was about eight but I've grown out of a lot of the hay fever symptoms
D	I've grown out of mine a lot
C	can you grow if it's not hay fever? yours is
B	well it's an allergy to pollen
C	I mean no offence but you only get yours one month a year
B	no I would say about eight weeks
C	okay mine's twelve months a year
A	to be honest with you I think the house
B	dust dust
C	yeah but it's I've noticed that there's no difference from being in the house outside
A	oh right okay
B	ah you see that's a good point
C	at school anywhere
D	hey listen upstairs in the loft I bought you got what you call a Medivac
D	you could have now
C	I like how it's upstairs in the loft with all the dust on it probably just blow out loads of dust
A	a Medivac
D	now listen
B	we've got we've got er we've got the Miele allergy erm
D	I mean
B	I know they do
D	he he used to vacuum everything with the Medivac
B	yeah
A	did it work for you?
D	well we also got special sort of covers
D	you know er I've forgotten what you call them now
A	covers?
B	covers
D	covers that they don't let the dust mites through
B	yeah we've got those on pillows
D	mm
B	mm
D	I've got them on pillows and I've got a mattress cover like that
B	yeah
D	but I mean it's horrible once it starts
B	yeah
A	it's for me and
C	yeah but even you can tell when I speak you can hear it's you can hear it can't you?
B	why don't you do a just do er an allergy test to see what it is?
C	I'll do any tests
B	it could be part of your diet
C	it's not er no I'm not changing er what I eat
D	oh come on yes it could yes it could
C	but
B	it might be milk
C	yeah but I wanna be able to drink milk for the next few years
B	yeah but you could have a different type of milk
C	I don't well I've been trying goat's milk for a lot of years
B	well maybe if you had
B	coconut? or soya?
D	oh no
C	please that's just no
A	milk stout
C	goat's milk tastes no different to cow's milk though really does it?
A	no not in the new ones
B	well we'll we'll go for your check-up and ask we
C	but it doesn't make any difference it doesn't make it less
D	now is that the test where you have a scratch?
B	yeah they what they do they put they put little things up there
D	and they put it yes
C	they're not putting anything on me
B	I went for it and only one of mine
B	everybody I was sitting with in the room oh three and four were swelling up I only had one
B	they said
D	I had one with tomatoes anything red
B	did you?
D	and I mean I eat oranges and tomatoes like they're going out of fashion
B	you see vitamin C's a natural antihistamine
D	mm
B	so
C	you you say that does that mean that orange juice makes you get colds then?
B	I don't know but do you not produce too much histamine?
C	yeah but I I don't wanna not produce any cos I noticed
B	oh I don't think
C	since I've stopped taking them I've not had a cold since
B	oh interesting
D	mm
B	you should do research
C	I don't like it it's I find it tedious
B	we'll go we'll go and ask the doctor
C	yeah I don't think he really knows
D	I don't really think he's got any time for anything else
C	he's paid several hundred thousand pound a year so the least he can do is to
B	it's
D	but also there's a lot of bogus people around
B	oh they're rubbish
B	well you've got to go through the medical route they're just trying to flog you something
D	but you know it costs about two
C	what's it called? that erm begins with an H

C	oh yeah I
D	yeah
B	I was gonna say we always run out of basil don't we? that's the one
C	yeah that's the one er the the one thing we actually needed was yeah was
B	can you not dig up the thyme and put the basil in?
D	what's?
B	in its place? yeah
D	what's the one were you you put a leaf in?
B	erm
D	two
B	bay leaves you're thinking of
D	yes they're about that big mm mm

C	it's a Kazam Trooper
D	yeah but is it okay?
A	it's the cheapest one you can get
C	yeah well it's not the cheapest one you can get it's very popular actually
B	it depends on
D	is this pay-as-you-go?
B	yes but mine's a contract
C	you can get a lot cheaper
D	they're not doing those contracts in Tesco's again cos I was asking
C	oh they will be
B	they will be
C	that's where they make most of their money
D	no not in that store they've phased them out in
C	oh in
B	no but they'll be doing a similar one they'll do
D	no they're not going to do mobile phones
B	at all?
C	yeah but not in that shop but Tesco's PLC is still
B	oh but Tesco's'll
D	no not in
B	oh you'll get one in er
A	let
B	if you want to keep your Tesco number you can get one at
C	but you can get one of these maybe for a lot
A	can you put it back in there when you've finished?
C	this'll be only about thirty quid
D	well that's what I was asking about you see
C	whereas this is about double the price
D	I told her that you'd got one but she said they don't now come on
C	you can get this from Argos as well
D	and how much did that cost?
C	that'll be thirty quid that one there that
D	and er what about the one your dad's got?
C	that'll be about eighty maybe but we got it cheaper
B	no it was it was sixty to forty
C	yeah it was on offer
B	there's
D	but
B	he's pay-as-you-go
C	yeah I got him on the Three network
D	ah I like pay-as-you-go
B	right well how much as that again? it's er
C	well the Three network is three pence per call minute two pence per text and one pence per one penny per megabyte of data that you use on internet
B	that's what these two are on
D	can you pass it over now
B	do you like that? sound of that?
D	what?
B	the pay-as-you-go?
D	I just want to know how the how do you switch it off? I mean I'm so
B	I
C	oh with that button there
B	yeah but you might get a different make out of it
C	yeah I'd better not show you cos you might get a different one
B	they're all different
C	they're all different yeah
B	you don't want to learn how to switch it on cos once it's on you never turn it off do you see what I mean? so once we'd
D	I just wanted to see that fox again
B	once we've switched it on for you show
D	let's have a look
B	once we've switched it on for you
C	turn it on
D	yeah
D	now where's the fox?
C	that's on the other one
D	oh is that yours?
B	you can you can put no that's
C	text
B	but but because once your phone's switched on you never turn it off
D	oh er yes yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
D	well I'll yes I'm sure
C	is your phone alright though? surely
D	well it's okay but it doesn't
C	you can get a new one that's just like that if you want
D	you can't get those though
C	oh yeah you er you can get a similar little
D	your mum bought me that at least
B	yeah but you can get a similar there's a lot of them about if you don't want
C	yeah but you can get one very similar
D	well maybe I
C	well I don't think it's coming up in the world
B	it depends what you need it for if you're only texting and calling you don't need internet
D	I only text and call because that's all I can do
B	that's what I mean do you want internet as well? oh you do? right but you want pay-as-you-go?
D	if possible
B	depends you see if you have to decide how long you're gonna be on it and how many calls and how much internet you're gonna use cos you might be better on a contract do you see what I mean?
D	yes yes
B	because their pay-as-you-go is really good but they don't use it much at all but if you're gonna be using the internet on it
D	mm
B	you might be better with a monthly contract
D	well I'll think about what er
B	do you see what I mean?
D	yes I'm not going to be frightened of technology I'm going to get with it
B	no but but but but that's what I mean so you'll have to decide er
D	mm
B	whether you want a
D	well we had a monthly contract and it was disastrous
C	oh but if you're the best thing about a contract is if you lose a phone they just send you a new one free
B	you get a free phone
D	no but what happens if somebody uses it or as soon as you've lost it
B	just tell them straight away
C	well that's the point of the contract
B	you just tell them it's you've lost it
C	you will be worried if you're on pay-as-you-go cos then they can spend your money
D	it used to be the other way round you used to pay to rent it and then you'd paid for your calls as well
B	ah it's different now though
C	oh no when
C	when was that?
B	it's yeah it's different
D	the first one I ever had in nineteen eighty
C	what? the eighties? oh right okay
B	you see if if if if you're on er a contract you wouldn't have that worry
C	how much do you spend a month nowadays?
D	well I got fifty pounds on my phone about nine months ago
C	ah right fifty divided by nine is
B	yeah but if she's gonna use the internet or
C	five pound something
B	that's without the internet
D	you can't
C	yeah but internet's free in most places
B	it is free like it's free here
C	you would only use mobile data if you were really pushed and you didn't have anywhere else
D	now I want you to come with me with my erm laptop and I want us to go into either
C	come here
B	yeah
D	or here I would've brought it if I'd've and for you to show me how to get onto the wi-fi here
C	yeah cos then once you can do that you
D	and then what to do when I get home
C	oh when you get home's fine
D	that's what everybody says and it never flaming is
C	oh you've done it before?
D	er no well you see I went down to
C	I'll show you how you get onto wi-fi anywhere whether it's home here
B	we'll show you we'll call in on the way back and he'll show you
C	yeah
B	yeah we'll
D	yeah cos then then I can give you those things
B	mm
C	and I'll tell you er and you I can sort out all your problems when we're there
D	you could maybe take
B	if it fits in yeah
C	I'll sort your problems there out when we
B	yeah
C	call in yeah
D	your dad's getting his erm groceries
B	seeds yeah
C	yeah well let's wait a bit we'll wait for him to come back then we'll move
B	right
C	yeah
B	that's a good idea but er
D	I haven't got a watch on anybody got a watch?
C	no what time is it?
B	you see if if you if you're happy carrying your laptop around you might just want a phone that texts and calls
C	yeah
D	I'm not happy carrying it around
B	right
D	but sometimes I want to take it around
C	I think that you might be
D	it's too heavy
B	right
D	it's only flipping a year and a bit old don't you tell me it's old
B	have a look at it
C	I'll have to have a look at it yeah
B	it might have a lot of stuff
C	might have a lot of rubbish on that we can just forget about and it's good to go again
B	yeah
D	mm
B	yeah
C	it does actually yeah bloatware
B	cos if it's if it's only a year old it shouldn't be slow
D	er yeah and something else I don't know if it's got any protection on it
C	I'll check that it'll probably have a AKG I'd have thought
D	look I don't know I need you to show me okay
C	I'll sort all that out for you
D	and fancy when I first saw you
B	mm
D	I couldn't believe that fifteen years later you're telling me all about how to do my internet
B	yeah
D	oh it's
B	you'll have to
D	second day of your holidays
C	yeah
B	have to decide
B	I
C	I I think you'll get you won't like the screen
B	I think erm your tariff would be good
C	yeah but to be honest
B	yeah but er if you think er if you think nanny's gonna be in shops where it's free wi-fi
C	yeah
B	so I think she is better on your tariff
C	but then we'll have to see whether you'll be able to get network in
D	oh
C	I remember seeing on er do you get phone network where you live now? on your
C	network
B	it goes down doesn't it? your mobile network
D	oh sometimes it doesn't work at all
C	can you
D	well if I don't reply it's not working
B	mm
D	once I've got the text I feel I owe it to the person sending it to let them know I've er it's arrived
C	yeah but we can't get signal in our house at all apart from one place you might find that however once you've moved you'll easily get
B	oh
D	mm
C	so that might be a little encouragement to move so that your phone works
D	well that's the thing I'm making from when I when they invite me down to have a look at the flats I must ask if they have internet cos if they don't have internet
C	they don't have wi-fi there's not
B	it won't be free wi-fi
C	it will be it will be I'd've thought
B	but it'll it won't I think nanny'll have to get her own
C	oh no it'll be free wi-fi if it's like a house where lots of people are oh yeah definitely
D	oh I don't know we're all
B	I don't know
D	they won't be expecting many people there
C	it will be
B	oh you mean you can just hook into theirs?
C	and you'll be able to just they'll give you their password if you say yeah
B	oh that's true it's like like the university halls of residence isn't it?
D	oh right yeah
C	yeah you get it free there because
B	then yeah

B	yeah
C	if one thing does that you just get a lump sum
B	yeah just send the lot
D	I'm not worried I'm not worried about how much I get or anything

B	that's what I mean just say just say just send all the books you don't want send all the crockery
D	that I I've already got rid of the books I don't want
B	oh so what you've got you're keeping?
C	ask yourself do I really need this?
