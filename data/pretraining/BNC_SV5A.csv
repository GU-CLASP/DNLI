B	roses
C	hybrid?

C	oh
B	no idea why they're called dog roses
B	er they got a really lovely perfume I don't know why they have such nice perfume compared to other flowers

B	I think perhaps they just wanted to have a message of peace the person who grew it maybe
A	dog
C	I don't know about that can be used as a lethal weapon
B	I don't maybe they just
C	I've seen them

C	and not using full stops and things
B	do you know in some classrooms in America

C	mm
B	only some
C	mm
B	yeah
C	she's a proper badass
B	has she?
C	not that I know of

B	mm
C	cos like
B	do you think that's partly because
C	maybe
B	or is it just you that's confused?

A	going upstairs just
C	in my mind or what?
B	in your mind yeah

B	mm
C	it took me a while to understand who was who and which name was who cos they all they all of the girls sounded the same to me
B	yeah
C	I dunno I
B	yeah
C	but now I know
C	Calpurnia's the servant
A	let's go
C	things
B	do you know when? do you know?

C	and they might be
C	can't remember exactly
B	think we have to do forty-five don't we?
C	no
B	yeah let's do it for a bit longer anyway
C	okay cos the first thing
B	just to be on the safe side
C	cos er on the on the dinner table we did thirty-one minutes but I just counted that as thirty minutes
B	cos I might have to take bits off so
C	and then and then
B	do the full one
C	and then we did twenty-five minutes then it's thirty-five minutes and then
B	so did you
C	erm

B	well yeah but if he's
B	going here there and
C	everyone

B	mm
C	and like
B	yeah
C	and
B	mm
C	if I flex
B	I dunno
C	I think a lot a lot of
B	mm
C	not all of it but a lot of his weight is because he is quite strong
B	yeah he doesn't look unfit does he? so
C	no
B	yeah
C	I don't think

B	mm
C	I don't know about that
B	yeah
C	you know I love rugby
B	yeah
C	and soccer I I just
B	mm
C	cos I feel like I have to commit like I'm committing a lot of my free time to do rugby

B	mm
C	and they're like
B	mm
C	and I like
B	how do you mean? what because he puts things like his beats headphones on is that what they mean?
C	no like in front of his friends
B	mm
C	er that aren't nice people
B	yeah
C	and like he does a lot of photos like back from
B	mm
B	mm
C	I know that's
B	yes
C	er no
B	no I don't know
C	he
B	to be honest I don't really like
C	he hangs around with the popular kids
B	yeah
C	they'd be getting all the girls and
B	mm
C	and he tells me that that he like he he they do mock him like sometimes and he doesn't like it
B	what his friends?
C	his friends
B	has he got any nice friends?
C	he says
B	yeah
C	cos like
B	yeah
C	like
B	yeah
C	and then he'd be like made fun of
B	yeah
C	in front of all the girls and everyone
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	be hard wouldn't it if he was hanging out with all the popular but not very nice kids?
C	it would be cos we wouldn't be in the same group
B	yeah
C	cos like if I wanted to
B	yeah
C	anyone can get into the popular group if they want
B	yeah
C	but they'll be in the group
B	yeah
C	many people are like that they tag along constantly
B	yeah
C	they they be
B	yeah
C	just so they can be popular
B	yeah
C	and they never are popular
B	kinda sell your soul if you do that though don't you?
C	like
B	yeah
C	and
B	I
C	yeah
B	amazingly enough
B	mm
C	like
B	mm
C	there was this other popular group
B	okay
C	and then
B	mm
C	like
B	mm
C	because I know why he's doing it
B	yeah
C	he's trying to be popular
B	okay
C	I'm just
B	yeah
C	and you can see it
B	yeah
C	he's just kind of on
B	it's better to be in your own tiny little gang or even just have one friend rather than be
C	yeah
B	at the bottom end of a popular gang
C	it really is
B	that's kinda that's like the worst of the worst isn't it?
C	it really is I hate it I just
B	all your friends seem really nice
C	yeah
B	seem really lovely really nice
B	oh
C	like
B	mm
C	in front of the popular people
B	yeah
C	but then when you're just on a
B	yeah
C	but he's really
B	yeah
C	when it's just you and him
B	yeah
C	which is kind of
C	so like he's
B	that's a good way of putting it
C	I mean like he's in the stage
B	yeah
C	and er just because like
B	yeah
C	and he's kind of not being himself to me
B	yeah
C	which shows that he's gonna be like that but extreme
B	yeah
C	with the other people which
B	yeah
C	I don't know
B	yeah
C	I don't think I've been in stage two though
B	yeah
C	in in
B	mm
C	and I wasn't really trailing behind
B	no
C	like but they weren't really that mean
B	they were alright really weren't they?
C	yeah right
B	yeah
C	but
B	mm
C	like
B	yeah
C	because he he he'd be
C	yeah
B	or you you were
C	like when we were trying to play Jenga he'd just
B	he's hard work
C	jump the table on purpose
B	yeah
A	is there a cunning reason
B	erm
A	oh
B	sorry
C	yeah
B	do you know what I mean I just think er?
C	I'm gonna make sure
B	yeah
C	I dunno how how to stop
B	you have to hope for the best I don't think you can stop
C	like you can't say like don't really hang out with them can you?
B	no but
C	cos then they're gonna wanna hang out with them
B	no
C	and they're gonna be unhappy with anyone else
B	I suppose it's like with you I've tried to just talk with you all the way through and if things come up I've tried to sort of say
C	yeah I think you have to
B	yeah
C	like to be humble cos like popular people aren't humble at all
B	yeah
C	like I'm
B	mm
C	and he was like who are you?
B	mm
C	like I don't even know you
B	mm
C	which is really insulting cos
B	yeah it's really is I do
C	I I met him in the class before
B	it's really unnecessary as well
C	it got him a reputation
B	a reputation amongst other twats though that's the thing
C	I know
B	and
C	I've seen many
B	it won't necessarily stop you in life like like when I had my friends my
C	oh yeah he's not my friend
B	yeah he's not your friend but anyway these blokes
C	yeah I know that
B	do you cos I didn't know that?
C	I
B	I didn't know that at the time I wish I did cos I should've gone off with one of those scientists
C	how how do you know then?
B	cos somebody in the end told me
C	oh
B	and he actually
B	so yeah you don't
C	yeah
B	about the other group do you?
C	no
B	also it's completely different out in life isn't it once school stops finishes
C	do you
B	mm
C	like
B	but he's alright guy isn't he?
C	yeah he's
B	to be honest he's
C	yeah yeah and like
C	and then we have
B	that's not really nice for
C	and yeah
B	do people do people look up to
C	er people see
B	yeah
C	like
B	yeah
C	I mean like if you're good at sports VIP pass to the popular group
B	so that's quite cool isn't it? so he could if he wanted but he doesn't
C	I mean he couldn't be the
B	mm
C	three's like
B	yeah
C	and let's let's say
B	yeah
C	and these guys are like

C	he's just funny
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	no I I don't
B	actually in a weird way I little bit surprised that you've not been cos you used to be
C	yeah
B	all the time
C	yeah
B	I'm quite pleased about that
C	yeah
B	even though I think you probably are sometimes a bit aren't you?
C	no I don't think
B	not at all?
C	no I don't
