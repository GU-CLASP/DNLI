A	I'm very like well why why aren't we living in like communes and why aren't we just fending for ourselves? because we're all buggering up the world
B	it does seem that way
A	it's too complex
B	I mean for all the benefits of erm of erm
A	yeah
B	losing perspective of what life is really meant to be about
A	and you know what you know like there's always the erm like they use in like science like animals and things and like making medicines and things my honest I don't I don't think there's an immediate need for all of those medicines if we were all not living in the lifestyles that we do
B	mm
A	like they're creating all these medicines for things that actually probably would be be prevented if it is wasn't for the world that we live in anyway
C	mm mm
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
C	there's various names for it cultured meat synthetic meat and shmeat
A	I like shmeat
B	schmeat
C	schmeat
C	and they've already made a burger by a Dutch team at the moment it's more expensive to make than conventionally produced meat but hopefully that will rebalance
B	mm
A	but then would the processes of making that
C	apparently it's cultured never attached to a live animal
A	okay but would there be someone who is kind of marginalising the processes like if they were gonna make that cheaper would then somebody a person
C	mm
A	be given unfair deal deals?
C	erm
B	as on not on the Wikipedia page
A	oh yeah yeah and are they gospel?
C	but you take muscle cells and apply a protein that promotes tissue growth
A	okay you could do that from injured animals to be fair
C	mm
B	mm
C	erm it would be theoretically possible to or to continue producing meat indefinitely without introducing new cells from a living organism
A	but if you think about it you know the human body if you hurt yourself your skin will reform over it and you can attach skin to skin and like
C	mm
A	you know you can move
B	mm
A	fat tissue around your body and stuff
C	yeah a bit like a sour dough just rising constantly
B	a bit like a yeast culture constantly growing
A	what if it got out of hand?
C	mm
B	shit
A	it's like hacking a bit off and fry it hacking a bit off and fry it come on
B	have a barbecue for discount price
A	everyone everywhere have a barbecue you can't stop it growing what if that happened?
B	and then there's a meat monster and it becomes sentient and we can't kill it because it's sentient now
A	but what if it suffocated you like you just you were in the building and it got it covered the doorway and it got so big and then you got?
B	that would be awful
A	see someone is always gonna be injured and someone is always gonna be
B	basically we can't win
C	but it's
A	no
C	true in anything we do like you just
A	you could get
C	you can hope to make things better but I don't think there'd ever be a way that we can all live without hurting each other or succeed without making someone else's
A	wow
C	life difficult
A	wow
C	I think that's very hard and we should always work towards it
B	I'm going to be like
A	advocaat
B	advocaat devil's advocaat to say oh you know no progress is made without marginalising or hurting something or someone but I know what you mean and we should always strive to not do that
C	I'm not saying it's good and we should strive not to do it but mm
B	yeah
A	oh yeah it's like every argument I have to have at uni is it always boils down to equality or something and I'm like yes
C	mm mm
A	but it doesn't mean that just because it's not achievable you shouldn't strive to it or do that
C	mm yeah you should get as close as you can
A	you should get
C	I feel like people give up and just do whatever
A	yeah like like
B	it's like oh we'll never get there so let's not try
A	yeah
C	mm
A	definitely
C	mm
A	and you should always attempt to understand more about what you're
C	yes
A	caring about and that's important
B	that's true I do live in ignorance of a lot of things because to be honest the news stresses me out and I I go into a tailspin
A	oh yeah the news is horrible
C	mm
A	erm but with like erm talking about schools and things is always the
B	mm
A	debate and like that you can't cos you've got a classroom of thirty children say how do you give an actual equal education to those children? do you give them equal time? time how much time are you giving them?
B	mm
A	or do you go these are the the less erm able children and I'll give more time to them but then the children that are more able why are they not getting that?
B	mm
A	why are they not being excelled as much? you know and
B	aha
A	it
B	yeah
A	just I've lost my thread of thought but like but by like erm
B	there isn't a simple answer
A	but by thinking about it and conjuring up those ideas and you understand that situation more
B	mm
A	to do the best by getting it by understanding it
B	yeah
A	and that is how I feel about lots of things
B	that makes sense
C	is it kosher in vitro meat shmeat?
B	shmeat
C	and that's a good question
A	how would it not be?
B	or how could it be?
C	some Muslim scholars have stated that in in vitro meat would be allowed by Islamic law if the original cells and growth media were halal
A	yeah
C	fascinating
A	then you get all of these people though that are like
B	oh no all the all the
A	I'm not touching it cos it's halal
B	all the in vitro meat is halal
C	but the best
A	because because like before er and no animal was killed it has to be alive
C	that's
B	they kill them when they're alive
C	there was the best quote someone said on
A	was it Russell Brand?
C	said it on Radio Four yeah or was it Russell Brand said it?
A	and he says the and he says
B	he did say that
A	he has a similar
B	and it was quoted it was quoted from a newspaper that was like
C	yeah
B	they they kill the animal they they like slit their
A	what do you want us to do give it
C	the animal is alive while it's killed yeah
B	yeah and it was something like they slit their throats while they're completely alive and it's like well yeah
A	well yes you're
C	yeah
C	you can like stun them
B	if
C	first but I think the stunning is as stressful as the killing thing isn't it?
B	yeah there's no evidence to say that stunning does anything
A	they're still alive and they will always come back around while they are bleeding to death
B	I don't think being stunned is a nice experience to be honest
A	no of course it's not and
B	oh you electrocuted me in the head thanks thanks for that
A	insult to injury yeah
B	so someone was like I'm gonna kill you now do you wanna be electrocuted first or do you just want me to kill you?
A	I'd just wanna be killed well it wouldn't make any difference
B	yeah
A	cos if I was gonna get slaughtered and therefore essentially bleed to death I wouldn't want to come back around during it I I'd you might as well just do it and let's get get it done and I think hunted animals are killed straightaway aren't they generally?
B	if you hunt
C	mm
B	something really well as in not with dogs to tear it apart
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you should shoot it in the head or the heart
A	yeah exactly so why are they not just doing that?
C	it doesn't always work out though
B	it doesn't always work out you sometimes shoot them in the wrong place but you aim
C	and then you have to spend days chasing after them to try and finish them off
B	that's horrible yeah
C	before they went around with like an arrow in their back or something
C	mm
A	I'd be like
B	that's why I haven't shot anything
A	no I wouldn't do it right
B	cos that happened to
A	mm mm
B	he was like you have to finish that squirrel off he's like you gotta wait for it to come back out the tree so you can finish it
A	mm mm
B	it's just horrible
A	I remember my dad erm when he used to fit phone lines and things and like he'd have to do a lot of outside like work to put the phone lines in through the ground and everything he accidentally dug through erm
C	oh
B	oh
A	and he had to end up finishing them all off like he brought home this bucket of rabbits to my mum going these er haven't got a mum any more you're their mum
C	mm
A	he had to literally just grab a spade for it like just to finish it
B	mm
A	I think it was that that had happened anyway he had to just do it
B	horrid
C	mm
A	yeah
B	really horrid
A	I don't like that kinda thing
B	yeah
A	it's just not it's just dying?
B	yeah
A	I've made
B	I didn't get that as much when I was little because I used to find birds that had flown into a window and like try and cuddle them back to life
A	mm
B	yeah
A	always just in shock they die of shock
B	they don't shock and their little hearts are like
A	they're not in pain
B	yeah and I've done that a couple of times and like I had like my so the cats are bought in
A	you always think that you can do it but you can't they will always die every bird
B	I was only little erm and
A	yes
B	try and make it better one time erm I there were the mouse was alive
A	yeah
B	and then I just assumed it'd gone to sleep so I was keeping in my room under my play pram and I think I covered it in a little cloth until my parents noticed the smell
A	oh
B	and they came and they they discovered it and they were like what the hell is this?
B	and I was like oh my mouse he's sleeping but he's gonna wake up at some point like I'm
A	mm
B	I'm looking after him and
B	they were like this mouse has been dead for days you need to flush it down the loo
A	oh
B	like my first experience of something dying I didn't get that it had died at all
A	mm
B	I was like well it's asleep for some reason it won't wake up and I didn't notice the smell
B	mm
C	mm
B	I know it's gross but little kids you know?
C	I I did I think I went back to find my goldfish
B	my
C	after they died
B	the
C	what? on purpose? or just
B	mm to have a look
C	why? yeah I did that yeah
B	see how it's getting on
C	yeah
C	just for the fish though
B	trying to think I'm sure it was my mum who said that and it would've been old guinea pigs and hamsters and things
C	mm mm
B	or rabbits maybe
C	ugh
B	they didn't have pet rabbits they only ate rabbits so it could've been
C	yes
C	mm mm
B	and I really like the way you cooked the steaks that was like blackened on the outside but still pink in the middle
C	mm well you need to make it very hot first and then you cook it
B	both sides oh
C	and then you check it
B	you check it?
C	mm mm
B	how do you check it?
C	with a slicey knife
B	a slicey knife
C	mm mm
B	so you're quite excited about the er prospect of lab meat aren't you?
C	yes
B	I can tell
C	well yeah from what I was just reading it sounds
B	it's no worse than my multivitamin
C	fine yeah they were saying someone was saying there was ethical concerns cos they had to use some sort of foetal fluid in producing the culture
B	foetal fluid from what animal?
C	a cow
B	a cow?
C	yeah
B	so they had to do something to
C	er yeah
B	a pregnant cow?
C	they need like proteins and stuff I don't know
B	foetal fluid?
C	mm
A	what's this?
C	I mean I think the early stages of
A	it might be done from things that they've already harmed
C	yeah
A	they could do it from things they've already produced
C	yeah you could probably get everything you need from that
B	apart from the foetal fluids that you just said
C	yeah
A	fluids?
B	foetal fluids apparently there's some concerns about ethics because
C	mm
B	of foetal fluid
A	in what respect? what way?
B	that that they need to use the foetal fluid of a cow in order to help create the cultures that you need
A	the foetal fluid?
C	yeah
A	are you on about just like when it gives birth and all the?
B	like amniotic fluid?
C	no no no well I don't know if it if it it I I don't know
A	cos if it's amniotic you can just wait for a cow to give birth and then just use it
B	like scoop it up
A	just be there with a bucket
C	erm reactions of vegetarians vary some feel in vitro meat presented to the public was not vegetarian as foetal calf serum was used in the growth medium
B	mm
C	but it's very early days like I think we'll I think we'll get better
A	will we get there though? or will someone else in a different generation get there?
C	I don't know there's a company that wants to be selling it erm
B	will the
C	within the next five years
A	it's the word lab that makes me think there's something there's something funny there
C	yeah we'd have to cast aside
B	have they actually made any yet?
C	yes
A	are they running their machines with little mice on turntables?
C	mm
A	cos something goes
B	cos you're against it
A	yeah is yeah is there
C	yeah yeah but like your carrots are probably exploited in some way
A	who are they testing it on? who they who they're testing it on might be considered very unethical
C	er what like who eats them?
A	yeah who
B	have you ever considered doing medical trials?
A	yeah
B	I see the adverts on the tube sometimes and I'm like
A	I wanna do Flucamp
B	Flucamp yeah
A	Flucamp you get four grand
B	it's like yeah I'll I'll do Flucamp I'm I'm strong and young
A	all you have to do is being isolated for two
A	and not have had a flu jab and I haven't had one I got offered I get offered
B	no I've never had one
A	I get offered them all the time I can get one for free and I'm just like no I can't be bothered
A	it's like a tenner
B	and I was like yeah
C	so do young people have a flu jab?
B	well I was like it wasn't that
A	I could have one because I can get one for free
B	just cos you can
C	yeah
B	cos I associate it with like my grandparents who like
A	but
B	are like yes get a flu jab because if you get the flu
A	if you've got certain criteria like being elderly or having certain medical conditions being pregnant like that kind of thing yeah
C	mm
B	get one definitely
A	but I cos I've been offered one
C	mm
A	quite a lot but you know I'm being offered one because it's a target
B	uhu
C	oh okay yeah
B	no I don't know if I have
C	how do you know if you have flu?
A	because if a
B	a lot of people say I've had flu but they've had a cold
A	oh yeah they promote a cold is not flu
B	yeah
C	oh okay mm
B	cos this is
A	a flu is you're like you're aching in your
B	this is why I was saying earlier cos you were like I'm sick of feeling run down basically
C	I feel like people use the word flu er just like cos they feel like they have a cold
A	yeah yeah people come into work all the time
C	mm
A	I say what are your symptoms? and they say flu and I'm like you've not got flu cos you're out of bed
B	yeah
C	yeah mm
B	like I know
A	you've got yourself dressed and you've come to
C	mm
B	I don't think I have ever had flu I think I've had
A	yeah flu is just you're horrible in bed and you're just you're not
B	I couldn't
A	yeah you're just completely kind of paralysed by it or
B	I my
A	mm
B	and just covered myself up mum came and found me and I was just like
A	mm
B	so she was just like right I'm driving you to grandparents cos that's the nearest place
A	mm
B	that's like
A	how old were you?
B	eleven
A	okay
B	er and I was like
A	oh were you on the inside?
B	yeah
A	oh the outside would've been brilliant
B	well it was erm
B	it was a bit of both to be honest
C	mm
B	and my mum always makes a joke about like oh that motorcyclist wasn't very happy
A	of sick
B	and I was like was there a motorcyclist
A	mm
B	so er it was some on the outside there was some on the inside there was some in the actual groove of the window
A	ah but if you need to be sick you need to be sick you can't always choose your places
B	that's the only party of the journey I remember and it was like a like an hour and a half journey and I don't remember anything else I was just
A	too knocked out
B	I was completely so that might've been flu cos I never went to the doctor about it and my
A	mm could've been
B	could've been anything yeah
A	could've just been
B	yeah
A	just like that
B	yeah
A	not being able and just
B	yeah I've had that tonsillitis as an adult and it wasn't pleasant but it wasn't it wasn't as horrible as I thought it was but I was told that I had a very minor case of tonsillitis like about as minor as you can get
A	yeah
B	and still have tonsillitis
A	I er I've had it and it's not it won't've been the worst tonsillitis
B	yeah I remember it being horrible to swallow things and just being the
A	mm
B	it's a sore throat but it's worse than usual and I feel more unwell than usual like I feel really woozy and hot and
A	yeah
B	just like rubbish and I went back to work and I couldn't really concentrate on anything and all the telephones ringing were like
A	ah
B	in my head
A	mm yeah
B	so that was that was
C	mm maybe
B	maybe?
C	dunno
B	might've? but have you
C	er probably not
A	I haven't had it definitely
A	apparently
B	I think my dad had flu when he was in London and he was living in that bedsit and he said that heater saved his life that little
A	yeah
A	do you remember when
A	and it's one it was one flu yeah bird flu
B	bird flu yeah cos there was swine flu as well wasn't there? but
A	no might've been I'm I'm trying to think of the actual specific cos er no might've been
B	some reason everyone's got it yeah
A	think they've got swine flu erm and so obviously when I was in working in
B	yeah I remember seeing those around
A	but erm my nan walked past it and she felt discriminated against she didn't bloody have it
A	she said I've been discriminated by Boots against
A	my my nan loves an ailment
A	she loves it she
A	she's not a nice woman
A	yeah but bizarrely we had
A	I mean
A	yeah
A	I
B	yeah
A	now it just feels like it's just healing now
B	yeah I'm getting more a
A	it's gone more normal
B	I feel like a get more kinda scabby bits than I used to
A	that's just the
B	but it doesn't hurt as much
A	I'm always doing this trying to fiddle round the inside of the
B	yeah I know and
B	I'm sticking my fingers up there
A	I'm gonna get this bit ear done on this ear I've gone like you now I'm gonna get wanna get
B	he he
A	get collection right I'm gonna get er so there there and there
B	nice little triangle
A	and then cos but this is what I'm confused about cos I wanna get a forward helix but would I get one there and one there?
B	you could get away with it but yeah
A	but then I thought maybe I'll stick it on the other ear but then does that make it look lopsided?
B	no no
A	I suppose if this one had a ring anyway
B	and you can very rarely see both ears at the same time
A	that's true
B	you even like face on you can't really
A	yeah that is true
B	like I can't see my
A	yeah
B	it'd look different and
A	me too
B	and I'm looking forward to changing the jewellery
B	no
B	on this side
A	oh no get em done whenever you want
B	I know it does still hurt a little bit to
A	oh I didn't even have the problem from day one
B	and it aches a little bit and I have to change
A	just slept with it straight away
B	so I don't know if they'll do it
A	yeah they will
B	do you think they will?
A	yeah course they will
B	cos they'll be like but we know that you've only just had those done
A	so? they know you said
B	once I'm happy to lie on this side then I'll go and get the other ones done but I want to be able to change the jewellery before the wedding in the summer or before Seychelles so either get it pierced after the wedding in the summer erm at the point where I could change the jewellery before Seychelles does that make sense?
A	yeah
B	so that's I could have?
A	when's your wedding in the summer?
B	July
A	so you're gonna get those done
B	I could I could get it done like when it we get back
A	or can you get it done now
B	I could maybe get
A	yeah do it now get it done now
B	I could maybe get it done in a month
A	yeah do it now I'll go with you I'll get some stuff done I'll get one the other one here
B	and that'll be like but it's on either side
A	no I'll be dangerous cos I don't really care
A	I'll sleep on a rubber ring
B	sleep on a rubber ring around your ear
B	yeah
A	a little doughnut under
A	mm that'd be quite
B	that would be I've kind of ended up doing
A	let's invent now
B	I've done that a bit actually I've slept like that
A	the doughnut the the piercing doughnut
B	the piercing doughnut doughnut
A	then you could like
B	it's out there
A	put put it on your tummy so if you wanna lie on your tummy if you've got a belly button piercing or
A	or whatever anything you know
B	any any kind of piercing
C	yes thank you
