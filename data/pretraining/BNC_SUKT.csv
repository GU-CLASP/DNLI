A	no milk
B	yeah
A	do you like honey in it? Or
B	er
A	loads of people who don't like milk in it like honey instead
B	do you always put honey in it?
A	not no I don't
B	do you normally normally?
A	I don't  normally take it
B	no I'll just  I'll just  have it er

A	mm
B	but someone said recently and I hadn't really realized this but he's not called Dr Who
A	yeah
C	no he's called the Doctor
B	Cos my housemate she just uses she got really
A	oh is this the one who's got the poster
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you know what I'd like

B	we
C	um
A	you didn't
C	oh can you
A	express an opinion either way
C	um yes
A	cool
C	now I feel guilty for causing two kettle boils
A	no it's still
B	you don't have to boil it again
C	if there's water in it
A	yeah
C	in which case you boiled too much the first time
C	sorry
A	it's a habit from work because
C	I am a grateful guest
A	if you just
C	mm
A	while you're standing waiting for it to to go
B	when I  when I  went to er
A	yeah
B	I had  I had  an interview at TTP
A	oh right
B	um last year
A	okay
B	um
A	bit random
B	and I think it was the reason that they didn't
A	oh god
C	mm
B	um
A	okay
B	and like sale or that's the impression I get is like
A	yeah
B	um and I hadn't realized that
A	yeah
B	I think that's what it was actually
A	right
B	you boil water and then it
C	mm
A	before yeah
B	when they don't need to do that
A	yeah
B	so you don't need boiling water for tea anyway
A	yeah
B	or whatever
A	mm
B	really annoys me
A	yeah
B	the technology's there surely? Well I mean he didn't didn't say that and I
A	yeah
B	I think I said that
A	yeah
B	I was well like surely it's
A	huh
B	I mean you
A	ridiculous
B	must be able to fairly easily just like get a decent thermocouple that
B	tells it when to turn off
A	yeah
B	on
A	on a kettle
B	a kettle
A	yeah
B	and I didn't come out with that
B	um
A	business
B	and stuff
A	yeah
B	and that's that's so simple
C	mm
A	mm
B	but one of my colleagues also interviewed there and got rejected
A	mm
B	giving feedback on on interviews
A	okay
B	if you don't get in
C	mm
B	they say don't be afraid to ring up and ask
A	that's really nice
B	I mean I
A	yeah sure
C	mm
B	um
A	right
B	but not on the selling and er sort of
A	oh that's interesting
B	financial stuff
C	hm
B	so yeah
B	he was er good at that kind of thing
A	business acumen
B	yeah
C	mm
E	I found them
A	you found them?
C	I will eventually need some business acumen
A	found what?
C	but er
B	yeah
C	I think at
B	we have salesmen they have sales sales people with
C	develop that while you're there
B	yeah
C	when you start you're er engineering skivvy
C	mm
A	sometimes just a skivvy by the sounds of it
C	yes
E	oo
E	yeah
E	well at least I probably should but I won't
B	it was the sort of sigh after he said it
C	my grad weekend experience was er
E	oo
C	a sausage fest
B	stop groaning
E	no I'm just thinking
B	he goes oo sausage fest
B	and then he looks at them again and goes oo
A	it's not great
B	you just can't stop yourself can you
A	Woah
E	ah
B	you just
A	yeah you did actually
B	then he goes ah
A	unconsciously
A	aw
E	oh
B	and again
A	are you very
E	oo
A	are you very tired this morning?
C	the last person I saw kick something like that was Attack Stig
B	oh yeah
C	did you see it?
B	yeah
C	um
C	the Stig
B	Stig's Chinese cousin
C	yeah
A	God
B	he was
C	just a very aggressive Stig
C	he kept
A	oh deary
C	attacking them and the cameramen and the director and
A	yeah
C	they had to corral him into a car
B	it was quite an interesting character
A	I think these are probably
B	oh Top Gear
A	I'll give them a minute on that side so they're nice and brown all over
B	that's quite good
A	are you  are you
E	I forget why?
C	yeah
A	you said the other name for um Sarah Millican's other name for Top Gear
C	I think we've had a discussion about who we'd snog and avoid
A	oh yeah we had a quite a
E	marry is obviously James May
A	then the other two it's just really not
C	I really do want to just slap that man
A	James May? Yeah but you wouldn't want to be married to Richard Hammond or Jeremy Clarkson would you
B	yeah
A	yeah
E	no I think James May is the most annoying
A	you it would have to be James May
E	er yeah
B	James May?
E	and
A	Clarkson's oldest
B	Clarkson's clearly the oldest
A	yeah
E	is he?
B	yeah
E	well
B	he looks
A	but perhaps it's
C	James May does not give that impression
A	he gives the impression of being quite old
E	I dunno
A	whereas Clarkson is just a grumpy old man
C	captain Slow
B	he's probably about forty
A	I reckon about that
C	forty?
B	whereas Clarkson's probably about fifty-five or
C	oh
A	yeah I was gonna say sort of mid-fifties yeah
B	yeah
C	okay
A	Hammond's probably early forties
B	er
C	I'd no idea
A	hm? He's probably not that old
C	roughly um
A	I suppose he could be a lot
C	Clarkson's age
A	it's hard to know he's sort of baby-faced but but yeah old
C	um but he
A	okay
C	and talking about the the old one was all kind of wood panelling interior and and and leather and er sort of smelling of tobacco much like the inside of James May
A	would anybody like some sausages?
C	Wood panelled
E	please
A	do you want me to get you some?
B	Wood panelled and smelling of tobacco
E	the best thing in Top Gear is
C	whereas the new one is just like being inside James Kirk
E	do you know who that is?
C	I have no idea
B	yeah
A	James T
C	there we go
A	James T
C	so it is James
B	yeah it is James
E	oh yeah
C	I just assumed
E	is convert that inside of that old Jag um into the inside of a country cottage
A	oh yeah
E	with flagstones and log burning stove
A	yeah
E	and armchair
A	that was very good
C	that's amazing
B	top Gear's a lot
C	I didn't see that
B	of crap but it also does a lot of good stuff as well
E	yeah
C	guess you can just pick and choose it
B	mm
A	alright
E	oh yes
A	yeah so there's like there's three each
C	I just watched the er that one with Attack Stig
A	do you want the buns? Oh I got two buns but there's only six buns
C	yeah Matt LeBlanc
A	that was it
B	mm
E	mhm
C	set a new record
A	I'm gonna have one bun then
C	gives you an opportunity to try and decide whether he is actually acting himself
B	shotgun not having  shotgun not having  the floor bread
A	oh
B	oh
A	oh my word
A	oh shit
B	Peter prides himself  prides himself  on the cleanliness of the floor
C	yeah which one hasn't been on the floor?
C	no
B	I'll have to have floor bread then
C	in the packet
A	the one that was right next to Peter's foot
C	oh
B	oh no
A	um so I thought there was two buns
E	oo
B	again it's not so much what you say
A	someone can have the bun on my plate I've opened but not put anything in
B	which one?
A	the one that I've ripped open but not done anything with
B	oh here
E	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't actually mind floor bread
B	I was only joking
B	mm
A	it's alright Eeyore I know it's only a joke
E	what's he doing in here?
A	moved him out of the study
E	oh okay
A	bit disturbing for whoever's in the bed you see
E	angry bird
A	no he's there
B	no angry bird's down here as well
A	he's very angry
E	mm
B	angry bird is angry
E	mm?
A	he is a really angry bird now
C	I can see him staring at me all night
A	mm
E	yeah we should probably put him in the hall
A	um so yeah I mean there are kind of two buns for two people
E	mm
C	mm
E	I'll wash the other glasses
B	where are they?
C	I dunno what
E	somebody's just moved them

C	hm

A	yeah
E	with some flowers
B	oh it's Mothers Day isn't it
E	mm
A	oh that's a good idea
B	need to phone mother
A	I did
C	I actually yes I I actually
B	well done
C	I'm so proud of myself
C	I'm usually so shit at presents
B	what what did you do?
C	um just a card and little present
B	I didn't manage a present this year
C	little coaster
B	got her a card but
C	I think you you'll probably see them in the market
B	A hot thing
C	hot poker
B	mm
E	mm
C	yeah
C	and this was a little little coaster with um ten house rules
C	one
B	the first rule of house is mum is always right
E	I wouldn't want to live in that rule at her house
B	yeah I thought you said poster as well
A	I was wondering what poster you'd bought
A	mm
C	Smoky
B	the thing is
E	yeah
A	do you mean this house?
E	well in this house yeah
B	just every house
E	yeah the
C	nod and smile and walk away
B	indulge him
A	aw
A	generally work
E	generally works out for the best
C	you don't happen to have a charger that will? Charger?
A	no
C	we have the same phone don't we
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah I know that's why I thought there was a chance
B	but unfortunately I didn't bring mine with me
C	no
B	but you've got the white one
C	got thirty percent charge
B	you've got the white one and I have not got the white one
B	is it still going strong?
C	oh yes
B	the old San Francisco from Orange
C	I'm feeling like
B	mm
C	updated it
B	I I I voided within a
C	I wasn't
B	day of buying it
C	I wasn't too pissed off about how it was working at the  at the  time
B	yeah
C	working alright
B	it is there's quite an involved process
C	yeah
B	I was quite surprised
A	hm
C	no
B	I just followed a few instructions
C	but it was successful?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	what do you mean all of the applications?
C	like I turn
B	what ones you you the ones you've installed?
C	um
C	crap it's starting up
B	you mean it  it
C	it's like switching on a computer
A	mm
C	and it opening every single program
B	but but when you say starting up do you mean like actually comes on the screen as if you  as if you  just pressed the the icon?
C	no
B	yeah but that's how Android does stuff
C	but it doesn't do stuff because there's so much crap running in the background
C	that
B	well mine's like that as well when you first start it up
C	no it's you you
B	Cos with Android you don't need to
C	you go onto Task Manager
B	yeah you don't need to do that with Android though
C	as soon as you're doing that
B	really?
C	it speeds up massively
B	are you
C	mm
B	well it might just be because one of the ones that's running is
B	a silly process that's like very processor intensive
C	I dunno
B	you shouldn't in in
C	I haven't got that
B	right
C	it's
B	it uses all the memory cos that's the best thing to do
C	maybe
E	does anyone mind if I have a second bun?
C	that's this is why I'm considering routing it
A	no you've I've got some toast instead
C	but um
A	mm
C	oh oh oh
C	well right
A	that's not gonna help it
C	right
B	oh that's not right
C	gallery
B	that is part of the
A	mm
C	Google Mail
B	why do they all start up?
C	maps
B	and they're all running from the start?
C	messages
B	yeah
C	my Upload
C	photo
E	to us to be honest
C	something called TouchPal
B	and that's all running?
C	yeah
B	that is kind of weird
A	mm
C	yeah
B	I think you should route it
C	I suspect I should
C	and save battery
B	how many sausages were there each?
C	I dunno
E	three
A	three
B	so that's mine then
A	yes if you'd like
B	oh one more
C	had another ostrich burger on Sunday
A	mm
C	it was very nice
B	they're quite good there aren't they
C	mm
B	I like them
C	yeah
B	when I was
A	well
B	in Australia I had quite a lot of kangaroo burgers
C	or well the first time I had one was when we were
A	mm
C	up in the market
A	mm
C	yeah
B	we ate quite a lot of kangaroo in Australia
C	mm
A	I
B	Cos it's cheap
A	yeah I sort of assumed that you wouldn't eat a lot of it
B	no it's actually
A	yeah
B	yeah you'd think it would be like a a sort of novelty sort of thing
A	mm
B	yeah it's really common
A	oh right
B	just buy it in the supermarket
A	mm
B	buy kangaroo sausages burgers steaks in the supermarket
A	mm
B	just like you would beef or lamb
C	mhm
A	hm
C	I mean I have to say that that is the only flaw I I find on the phone
A	hm
B	mm
C	I have to spend
B	mm
C	a couple of minutes killing everything
B	it's weird that all that stuff would start up in the first place
C	mm
B	Cos memory management's so good
B	are there different sorts of sausages?
A	yeah
B	this one tastes really nice
A	pork and something
B	yeah
A	mm
B	fruity or herbal or something
A	yep
B	mm
A	yeah cos um the other ones are just pork
E	yeah
C	mm
E	herbs
A	I know you don't like a herb in a brekkie sausage
E	no I just wondered what sort of shit you've put into it
A	oh right
C	mm
B	you're very particular about your breakfast sausages
E	mm
A	you like sort of sixty percent bread for
E	yeah
A	but does anyone want any?
C	alright catch me a Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler
A	hm?
C	cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler
B	no
C	he's an itinerant salesperson
A	mhm
C	unless it's sausage in a bun
A	right
C	sausage in a bun
A	mhm
C	um
E	there's a film here called Fightville

A	what?
E	it's not
A	oh
E	there
A	oh ville
E	no
C	um comedy about an alien crossover
C	you did actually watch it
A	no I watched
C	oh it's
C	it's
A	I did watch
C	damn
A	I'm actually more a
C	four letters
C	very similar words
A	it was quite good
C	mm
A	I think it's just
A	films
C	yeah
A	but each to their own
E	mm
E	hm
A	hm? What's Fightville about?
C	he's doing it again
B	grunting?
B	well that's not  That was more of an interesting sort of hm
C	yeah
B	than a ah
C	yeah that one wasn't
A	at the end of the day you're gonna produce a report on the different types of grunting noise
B	mm
A	sighs
B	grunting message from
E	mm
B	no there's no need to repeat cos it's all on that  it's all on that  little recorder anyway
A	mm
B	so
E	oh we taped it
A	any signs of it that it is?
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	conduct a study into
A	what's it about?
E	no idea
C	what's in Ingenia?
B	oh
C	oh the airship renaissance
B	yep
C	I've seen that written about
B	it's quite interesting
C	quite a while ago
B	yeah
C	but um
C	but I think this is something similar to the to what I read about before
B	it would be quite funny if they started calling it the renaissance
C	sorry?
B	it would be quite funny if they just abbreviated it just to the renaissance
C	mm
B	you read NCE?
C	mm
C	it's not the most amazing publication
B	says it's  says it's  written very badly sometimes
C	yeah
B	lots of grammatical errors and things
C	sometimes you can tell that um it's an unsuccessful edit
B	yeah
C	they thought oh and it we need to cut this
B	mm
C	but they accidentally left a word in or something actually
A	mm
C	or or or something like that
A	yes
B	yeah
A	oh
C	hm
B	Don't you want them?
C	hm?
A	if you don't want them leave them and we can either eat them now or
C	I could have
B	what cos there's no bread you mean?
C	yeah
A	there's there's
B	or just bread presumably
A	no it's frozen bread
B	oh it's frozen? Oh
C	um
A	I could
C	I could try
A	you could try
B	oh
C	no I'm just
A	for some reason I had in my head there was two
C	not particularly energized
A	buns each
C	mm rooibos
A	one or two slices?
C	hm?
A	one or two slices?
C	um
A	two
C	I envy you having a freezer
B	just empty it
B	just take all the stuff out and leave it on
A	yeah
B	and put your own stuff in
A	unless it's all frozen in there so hard that you can't prise it out
B	mm
C	so we're none of us are continuing in that house after the twelve months expires
B	well it sounds pretty dreadful
C	mm
E	yeah but you like having something to complain about
C	complain about other stuff
B	complain about you
A	aw
E	just harsh
A	oh this T-shirt's nice
E	it's merino wool
A	mm bit posh

B	that's not actually toast
A	aw
B	that's also tragic
C	it's just slightly warm bread
A	yeah
E	wow

B	Cos she's like she does  she does  laugh at quite a lot of things
A	yeah
B	and you're like what are you laughing at? And she'll go oh I just thought about the way you just said this
B	she notices everything
A	nice
B	I don't think it's very healthy long-term to
B	find everything
A	yeah
B	anyone ever says slightly dirty
A	you'd be the manager
B	she's doing quite well
C	it happens mainly cos everyone in my house notices it
