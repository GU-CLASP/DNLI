A	you wouldn't be much use in an actual SOS situation if you're looking up SOS Morse code on Google before you send it
B	well I might remember it now I've looked it up
B	probably the last time I looked it up was when I was a child or I found what it was
A	yeah you'll probably never need to use it
B	have to go and see what's
A	oh
B	I'm surprised she answered so soon cos she's like
A	why?

A	has been
B	sent it to her home phone
A	well how was that?

A	well I didn't look at that I just tapped in
B	yeah
A	so I put
B	well you get an option of mobile number 0 seven number
A	well I
B	or
A	you should have told me that I just clicked
B	you don't that's why I said to her mobile
A	you didn't say to to her mobile you just said to
B	I did
A	you no you just said
B	no I said can you text her? then I said send it her mobile

B	I think you you just keep your finger there do you and it brings up the option?
A	does it?
B	I don't know
A	copy message
B	I've just deleted a lot of it cos I I haven't deleted any message for ages I've just the other day I was going through and started deleting them so I wanna try and

A	yeah I was gonna say I was like
B	I hope you've not sent it to the house again
B	erm could reply yes please if you don't mind no that's a bit cheeky isn't it saying er yes we will thanks?
A	why is it a bit cheeky if you said yes please if you don't
B	cos it's repeating what

A	so what do you want me to put yes?
B	yes please thanks yes please thanks

B	yeah
A	no she just says
B	cos we already said we'll collect her
A	yeah
B	another message
A	oh
B	okay
A	probably
A	although I do now as well like I never used to when it cost me
B	do you?
A	but because I've got free text if I'm having a conversation with someone then of course I do
B	do you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so and you would say okay then
B	yeah you get like a conversation
A	yeah
A	so
B	so are you inundated with text messages from your friends?
A	what?
B	are you inundated with text messages from your friends?
A	no I get like none it's usually like Vodafone saying like
B	but you told me you were on silent cos you get loads of messages
A	I don't get loads but like I just don't like to be disturbed so I always have it on silent at night cos I get like weird like Natwest texting me and stuff like thanks for
B	oh right
A	changing your address and then as soon
B	yeah
A	thanks
A	yeah
B	you know
A	so
B	you know they should do it within normal hours
A	so I always just have it on silent at night and then I never like because I get so few needed text messages or calls I just don't bother I like literally like yesterday I just didn't use my phone at all and then er when I went to I clicked on it cos I wanted to look something up on the internet it was dead and I had to plug it in to
B	why?
A	well I don't use it like I don't realise it's running out of battery do I? it's just there on silent and then if I'm not going out anywhere I'm not using it so then it just runs out of battery
B	well what if somebody needs to
A	most people don't
B	yeah but some people might
A	like you you're literally
B	yeah
A	the only person who rings me
B	oh that's why you have it on silent all the time
B	oh dad rung me again get it on silent
B	he wants a conversation
B	doesn't he know people don't do that these days? they send texts
A	oh I've not brought my Tesco Clubcard are you getting fuel here?
B	mm
A	oh
B	I'll keep the receipt no I'll need the receipt cos
B	no I need to like keep track of what I've spent how do you know otherwise?
A	well write it down in your little notebook
B	is that one you're gonna buy me is it?
B	everything is up here it stays there
A	does it?
B	I never forget
A	does it?
B	but it's up there but I I can't find it that's the problem
B	there you go
A	yeah the only thing I use my phone for is I'm out and mammy's not there I'll call or text mammy and if I'm at home and it's just you ringing me really and then like companies like Vodafone or Natwest
B	well you sounded like it the way you were saying
A	or like apps giving me push notifications it's like go away
B	what's he doing?
A	I've bought my glass water bottle
B	oh did you? oh was looking them up the other day
B	yeah like just for a few minutes er cos I thought oh it might be good to get one yeah I could only
A	yeah
B	where's he going?
A	yeah I think it'll be a good a good investment
B	so where have you bought it from?
A	Ebay
B	oh right how much?
A	for twelve pounds
B	and erm
A	it's Grip and Go
B	yeah
A	and it's the green one
B	what does it have like an outer thing on it?
A	yeah just like a little one just like a little silicon thing
B	and was there no delivery charge for it?
A	no
B	when I I saw one most of them were just saying it's glass and this that and the other
A	yeah
B	well one of them was like there's no BFP or whatever is that what it is?
A	BPA
B	yeah I thought is that not just on plastic?
A	erm it means no BPA on the silicon top
B	oh right
A	although
B	so it's funny
A	yeah
B	none of the others had it
A	no they all they all say no BPA if you read the description properly
B	oh
A	it should do anyway all the ones I was looking at had it anyway but erm
B	no you could see it was glass
A	oh was it? are you sure?
B	yeah yeah
A	which one was it?
B	cos it was
A	oh right
B	no no I didn't look on Amazon I just put the name in
A	oh right
B	for a
A	no well on Amazon they all say BPA free
B	oh right
A	cos the tops obviously can't be glass so it's either like metal or a bit of silicon or something and it's it's BPA free free
B	yeah I did see one
A	mm
B	that's like the bottle I have with the ceramic cork thing but
A	yeah
B	a smaller version
A	yeah
B	so I'm thinking I might you know of getting that it's only about three pound
A	oh right
B	cos I'm not keeping water I want it you know
A	mm
B	at the desk and I can leave it in my locker and so I want to drink quite a lot of water especially when I'm cycling
A	uhu
B	erm it's about seven hundred mil or something
A	yeah oh that's quite big
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	well I I've got it didn't look big and I've got a similar bottle and it's one and a half litres and it just looked like a normal
A	oh right
B	size so I think they're quite wide so I don't think they're long
A	oh right
B	it's just probably wide
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know you can get seven
A	mm
B	fifty?
A	mm
B	and it's wide rather than long?
A	yeah
B	and they're they're quite handy those ones are not bad
A	oh
B	with that I went into it then
A	yeah
B	ninety-eight and it come up saying oh if you spend two pence more you get free delivery so I don't know why it said on the original thing you could be entitled to free delivery for it
A	it's because
B	it's funny if you spend over twenty then
A	yeah well well you are entitled to Amazon free delivery if you spend over twenty pound but that's how they write it you are entitled to free delivery
B	right
A	but then if you read it all it says if if it's over twenty pounds
B	yeah cos with you saying oh it we'd both get one and you might go for it so
A	yeah
B	so I was thinking I might get one
A	yeah well I mean they've not dispatched this one yet they should have done but
B	well why would they not dispatch it?
A	I don't know they should do
B	when did you order it?
B	normally you get a thing saying it's been dispatched or at least an email saying we've got you order
A	yeah they've got the order
B	but did they send you a message saying dispatched?
A	no that's what I'm on about they've not dispatched it yet
B	maybe they don't but maybe they don't send you a message saying it's dispatched
A	no you have to on Ebay you mark it
B	oh do you?
A	they don't send it you just mark it as dispatched that's
B	oh right
A	how it works I've ordered from Ebay before
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	that
A	yeah I think the one I'm getting well I mean you can wait to see what mine looks like
B	I'll have to see what
A	I think it's quite erm durable it's quite
B	mm
A	thick glass
B	oh
A	cos one of them I was looking at Amazon cos it
B	mm
A	and I was like oh right maybe not then and it looks nice but I might as well get one that's more
B	as well I'm thinking though I you know I like it fairly lightweight and I don't want one
A	no you're not gonna get a glass one lightweight
B	I'd like to see if if it's durable it's not gonna be lightweight if it's lightweight it's gonna be very fragile isn't it?
A	yeah
B	for the lightweight it seems to
A	yeah
B	it would be thin glass
A	like so if you look for lightweight you wanna look at plastic or
B	mm
A	aluminium if you even if you look at stainless steel stainless steel's heavy
B	really?
A	but yeah stainless steel's durable but they are heavy
B	mm
A	I wouldn't have thought it's heavy stainless steel
B	yeah it is
B	oh right
A	heavy
B	mm
A	but like I said you've got to look erm on the inside to check it's the inside part the interior that's one hundred percent stainless steel
B	mm
A	and they're about the same price as the glass ones
B	yeah
A	got new shoes as well do you like my new shoes?
B	oh yeah are they the same as the old ones?
A	yeah exactly the same
B	you know I I was looking at them last time you you had those shoes on
A	yeah
B	I was looking and I thought I think you do need some
B	well cos they were looking a bit old so how much were they?
A	fifty pounds
B	really?
A	from Clarks
B	it's a
A	average in Clarks isn't it?
B	yeah they they wouldn't have gone in the sale a shoe like that
A	no
B	one anyway if they had the sale yeah the is that from
A	I don't know I'm trying to get in
B	right well it'll have to be you not me
A	what kind of
B	what she means is er like erm to accompany your meal do you like more potato with your meal or do you prefer do you eat salad with your meal or like?
A	I don't really like salad
B	well if you like potatoes then well
A	yeah I like potatoes
B	then say potato
A	so is that all you want me to say? potatoes?
B	no say whatever you'd say say
A	well what would you say? this is you
B	well you could say it's
A	no
B	or you could
A	yeah what would you say?
B	she prefers potatoes or potato or whatever or you could just ring her she's finished work now
A	I don't I don't want to talk on the phone
B	are you allergic?
A	yeah
B	oh right well you should put that
A	okay like she prefers potatoes but she doesn't mind either
B	you're happy with either sort of
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but I'm trying to I don't know what you would say
B	oh right yeah
A	cos it's from you
B	oh right
A	that's so that feels so weird for me to write like that
B	I know the they must be popular
A	I like I just yeah I always put a smiley face or something
B	what does it mean if you don't? would would it just mean you're a miserable sod?
A	no well it just depends on your texting style like
B	well that's it and they can only think
A	and then
B	oh why didn't I get a
A	yeah
B	smiley face? is she upset with me? that's the problem isn't it?
A	because like when I first when you first text people like erm
B	you have to just stick with what you do what you wanna do don't you really?
A	I know but some people like if they don't use emojis I I might not use them too many back because like if there's so so some people I might go a bit crazy with the emojis but if someone doesn't use them at all they'll probably think I'm a bit weird if I use them so I'm just like
B	see? I bet you get loads of texts I mean you seem to be a bit of an expert on them
A	not really oh yeah it's it's like usually like if I'm discussing the homework with somebody or something and I've not messaged them before like on Facebook or something
B	it's a bit odd isn't it?
A	yeah
B	unless they're the kind of person where they're very kissy kissy anyway
A	I don't know I think to be honest it's just something that people put
A	so yeah I'm happy they still stock the same shoes cos they're comfortable
B	mm they look a bit nicer than the last ones
A	a bit
B	but you could keep those anyway for when
A	yeah
B	if they're comfortable and you just use them for you know pop to the shops or whatever
A	yeah
B	so you don't you get more use out of those ones and you wear them when you're actually going somewhere or something
A	yeah
B	rather than using them every day well practically
A	cos I thought I can't be bothered going and trying on different ones that are on in the sale because erm
B	yeah and if they're comfortable then you know you're not gonna have problems with them are you?
A	yeah
B	that'll be
A	I know yeah
B	replying to her
A	she well she might have thought you could answer it like you you oh she just said okay erm she might have thought you you
B	uhu
A	she probably thinks you're texting back rather quickly as well
B	mm
A	it's so funny like when I was chatting to these Vodafone people online you know cos you can chat to them online to get help instead of ringing?
B	mm
A	and er it was for setting up grandad's erm phone like he wanted a different plan like just the really basic one where you just whatever you use like you top up and you use whatever you top up do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	like just like what you would expect cos he had some weird one before and er so I was chatting to them online and I was pretending to be him like you know cos obviously they ask for your name
B	oh
A	and stuff and I was doing it for him and erm
B	mm
A	erm and like I get er like the obviously like gave his date of birth and everything and er erm I was like oh just just please just set it up for me I I don't know what I'm doing you know
B	mm
A	and then and they're like and then they're like erm how often do you like use your phone how many minutes? and I'm like oh probably only call ten minutes a month to speak to my granddaughter
A	erm like cos I was I wanted to make sure they were gonna give him
B	yeah
A	you know like the thing and it they were like oh okay then and then they were like
B	mm
A	no
B	well does he not just get pay as you go one?
A	well we wanted that but
B	yeah
A	when we got bought it for him they didn't give us that they gave us like a thing where you like top up and you get so many minutes free er
B	mm
A	but then they took kept taking his credit when he didn't use it or something like after a certain amount of time and we were like no we didn't want this because we set when we opened it for him we were like we want the most basic like pay as you go thing and that's what they gave us so we didn't they we could get a different one but I chatted to them and they've just put him on a normal pay as you go thing
B	oh
A	cos it was ridiculous
B	what is it an English phone he's gonna use to speak to you or something?
A	no he just
B	oh
A	just so it's not expensive if he needs to ask us something and he's like at the shop or something
B	yeah
A	yeah but you have to
B	but you
A	top it up every month
B	well yeah you don't know what the deal is it's probably something like that isn't it?
A	yeah cos that's what it was with Vodafone and it was
B	oh right
A	stupid like
B	yeah
A	uses any of it
B	am I going the
A	I dunno
B	I am I'm going back to
A	you are
A	you always do that
B	I think I think I should have done that turnoff for there it's like miles now
A	I've been buying new stationery as well
B	why?
A	well I need some
B	what for when you write letters?
A	no for all my schoolwork
B	what do you mean by stationery?
A	like paper and pens and stuff
B	oh right
B	why do you need paper?
A	er what am I gonna write on?
B	don't they give you any at the university?
A	of course not they didn't give me any in college
B	oh
A	I had to buy everything
B	really?
A	yeah
B	the college don't give it you?
A	at college yeah I bought everything myself
B	oh right
A	they they wouldn't even print things for you I'd print it myself
B	I can't believe I've done this we're going round in circles
A	oh good morning Mr Magpie
B	so why don't you just buy a cheapo pad?
A	yeah that's what I've been buying
B	oh right
A	no yeah they don't give you anything at college or university I don't know why you think they would
B	well because why do they give it at your school and not college? you're not working or anything are you?
A	it's not yeah but it's not a compulsory education anymore
B	I thought you had to go to college
A	no
B	oh
A	no you can get an apprenticeship
B	well though yeah you have to have a job don't you yeah
A	yeah you can get an apprenticeship
B	so is that guaranteed that you'll get one?
A	erm well no but it's not guaranteed you'll get into college either if you don't have the right results
B	mm
