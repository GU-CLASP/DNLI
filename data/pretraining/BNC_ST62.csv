A	so are most of the things you have from like two thousand five or when?
B	no
A	like like when's all years begin?
B	well from two thousand and five right up to I guess December of last year
A	oh right
B	and I have a bunch of ones that for some reason I've named L J ran one to two three four and onwards
A	presumably L J would stand for
B	yeah and ran I don't know what ran means
A	you wanted to post them to the internet and they were something to do with running
B	no
A	random pictures are therefore called ran
B	I've just figured out how my mind works yeah
A	logical
B	yes
B	that's when our life started
A	I think it's when like we had digital cameras
B	no yeah it's when I I started getting my camera
A	ah
B	and I've got a lots lots of ones from
A	do you pestle or pestle?
B	pestle
A	I also pronounce it pestle
B	do you?
A	yes
B	uh have I been saying it wrong all this time then
A	I have no idea
B	well I was thinking more like my mum but I got it from her so
A	I'll refrain from the obvious joke about resemblances between your mum and Baba Yaga
B	maybe
A	but no seriously you know
B	no
A	oh
B	and I have a picture of some um not green tea I think it's I'm not quite sure what it is but you drink it on uh graduation day
A	not like special green tea matcha?
B	no I think it's it might be kombu
A	I don't know what kombu is
B	sea
A	Green tea with seaweed in it
B	something like that
A	so it's  a sort of
B	like kombucha
A	a sort of hazing of recently graduated students then
B	no no no that's that's given to the teachers
B	so I've got a picture of um a a some I think kombucha with uh  petals floating in it and the the guide to the graduation is just inside the frame so you can see that it says
A	perfect
B	yeah
A	you can post it to a stock site
B	uh oh yeah
A	okay right
B	so it's not yeah but it was kind of what I was going for for a a blog
A	even if it's awesome it's not gonna cut it
B	yeah
A	um because they can't afford to employ like professionals to evaluate the pictures
B	yeah
A	and to price them etcetera basically go entirely off technical specifications when they're deciding what to accept
B	really
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	it wouldn't get onto a micro stock site
B	I see that a lot of
A	keeping to the theme of micro stock most of the sites have list of things they don't want to see and it's usually like stuff that is lying around your apartment
B	but people do that
A	well
B	they took a picture of their neighbour's garden cos they liked their pumpkins or something
A	on the plus side that totally doesn't sell
B	mm
A	but it's not gonna sell so it's sort of self correcting right
A	brilliant demonstration of the market system or something
B	is that if you do a
A	could probably learn something about the marketing of photography
B	yeah
A	except who wants a stock photograph of a sunset
B	no
A	is this in the context of like pure photo context or are you talking like Day on Earth or what?
B	stuff like that like the photo files community
B	mm it's okay
A	depends what you're interested in
B	what are you looking at?
A	A photo of a strange strange statue
B	uh-huh
A	the one of the cat standing on the pile of houses
B	have I seen it? I must have seen it
A	I think you were there
B	okay I'm gonna google that and I'm gonna look for cat standing on houses photograph
A	that's art man
B	cat houses
A	you'll get hundreds of photos of actual cats
B	yes some people just vote for the cats
A	well who wouldn't
B	cats houses Yokohama statue
A	okay do you remember those shots from York you were talking about
B	yuh-huh
A	and wondering what they were
B	oh I know that
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	it's the one up the north west westest  near the  near the
B	okay
A	north of the train station
B	okay
A	anyway so just south of there
B	mm mm
A	just across the road outside the walls there's a sort of ruins of an abbey and there's a sort of museum castle and a park full of squirrels
B	mm mm
A	and that was where that all is
B	yeah
A	and then we did
B	we did
B	he didn't seem to mind
B	it's like cats are a lot like kids
A	it's our cat and we never posted it on the internet as
B	yeah yeah that's the main thing
A	look the cat is dressed as Santa
B	but he was very happy with it
A	well he was warm
B	yes
A	yeah
B	no
B	I guessed that
A	photographs taken at firework displays
B	oh I do that
A	I always find I end up with about four hundred and it can quickly trim it down to about one hundred but you really only want to keep about five and it's making the final cut right it's like which of these almost identical photographs is better
B	no no no if basically if if it isn't blurred it gets kept
A	oh really
B	yeah
A	I guess I'm better at taking photographs of fireworks than you which
B	you may well be
A	surprises me greatly
B	it's a matter of just holding the camera
A	no I I think digital camera shots that can come out not blurred
B	okay
A	I think I just take way many more than you at firework displays
B	could be
A	that's another thing that you can't sell anyway
B	I dunno
A	there was someone launching fireworks last night actually did you?
B	I didn't what time?
A	oh I dunno
A	no okay it must have been earlier than nine PM then
B	okay
A	that sounds painful
B	it is kind of hypnotic they were making I think it was Harry Hill that was making fun of kind of it the other day
A	what show about trucks was this like world's most extreme
B	Eddie
A	tough demon truckers of doom
B	it was the Eddie something or other trucking thing
A	A different trucking thing
B	yeah
A	oh the um after the famous company
B	yes
A	Eddie Stobart
B	that's it
A	which is a as I said
B	yeah
A	famous company in the UK so locally famous company
B	why I was look basically I find it very fascinating when they talk about um how famous or how many genuine fans they have
A	yeah it's like
B	that is  that is fascinating
A	can you think of any hobby more more like ridiculous than train spotting
B	um
A	truck spotting
B	I probably have a few of those hobbies myself
A	well yeah probably the same here but who was that comedian though was that on the radio or was it on TV the other day? I can't remember
B	well describe the comedian and I will
A	oh no the the joke was like all these train spotters
B	I I don't think I heard that or saw it or whatever it was on
A	was probably on the radio then
B	oh okay
B	oh could've been
B	yeah I can see why they'd need a few comedians on that
A	no don't you remember there was a comedian presenting a programme about Glasgow
B	oh
A	no it was about Glasgow
B	I thought it was more about his material
A	because let's face it if you're
B	um
A	you've been there
B	uh vaguely
A	that's Glasgow
B	mm mm
A	but that is a tiny percentage of the whole city
B	yeah
A	yeah not not some like economically devastated ex part of like a Balkan war zone or something like that
B	okay
A	yeah
B	well
A	on a related note I don't think I have any photos of Glasgow which is interesting given the amount of times I have been there
B	I've only been there once
A	might might be a further commentary on it
B	I have a picture of
A	that is very right and proper
B	interesting that you have nothing
A	mojo Jojo
B	no no I wasn't
A	um
B	I'm just I think he's advertising cars
A	and why not
B	indeed
A	it would be really  it would be really geeky to ask which kind of Mojo Jojo he was
B	okay what do you mean?
A	well I mean is
B	how would I tell?
A	oh I don't
B	I really don't care enough to do that
A	no it's not really worth the effort is it
B	I've got some of Odaiba at night and I think it might have been after the Dragonforce concert or whatever it was called
A	that was the Dragonforce
B	there's um trees
A	what is ume again in English?
B	plum
A	plum
B	it's not  plum but it it's close enough
A	if forced to translate it you could write Japanese plum or something
B	mm
A	they are actually more like apricots aren't they
B	they are more like apricots yeah
A	marvellous
B	they're nothing like plums
B	it's just one day someone said well plum
A	yeah
B	mm
B	uh-huh
A	that's something else I don't have I have no photos of badgers
B	I have never even seen a badger so
A	really
B	yeah never
A	wow
B	what do you mean that's fascinating? Why is it fascinating?
A	well it's just kind of weird to like live in rural England and never see a badger
B	I haven't actually lived in rural England for any length of time
A	I suppose suppose not actually
B	you don't
A	mm
B	melay?
A	M E L E S meles
B	okay
A	well it makes it difficult for me to try and explain the whole different types of badger problem if I can't even pronounce the word I want to use
B	right
A	okay
B	it was really good
A	fair enough
B	no but that sounds when I said that to someone they thought that sounded really nasty but
A	it certainly doesn't make it sound good
B	but it you if you look at the back the calories is not
A	is not
B	not too high
A	fair enough
B	it's a it's less than uh a regular regular coffee even
A	got it
B	because probably because it's just all flavouring
B	uh-huh
A	they think of the the the kind with the black and white stripy face
B	yuh-huh
A	which is meles meles
B	okay
A	it is
B	that's terrible
A	it's very terrible
B	anakuma
A	anakuma
B	oh
A	hole bear
B	right
A	the Japanese badgers actually look really similar
B	yeah
A	to like a British badger
B	right
A	but the existence of British type badgers is not known to people in Japan
B	right
A	and it's one of those things that's really hard to explain to people because then they start punching it into their dictionary and the dictionary is giving them the wrong answer
B	yes
A	because it's calling up the like generic Asian one
B	I get the idea
A	and there are no badgers in Hokkaido
B	that must be a very sad place
A	yes
B	yes
A	the one that you get in the UK is meles meles meles
B	now that is an awesome name for an indie band
A	yes
B	mm mm
A	and in like Afghanistan and you know around in the Middle East you get meles meles canescens
B	okay
A	there's the Rhodian badger
B	why?
A	you you should go out and take nature photographs
B	you can't
A	they're great for selling to stock sites
B	yeah
A	you know I was trying to sort out my photos and I've just spent the entire time talking about badgers
B	and I'm I'm actually getting on quite well I'm
A	I'm way behind where I want to be
B	right
A	do you see what I mean?
B	yeah
A	so if there were sort of two distinct activities on one day they'll become two different folders
B	yes
A	yeah
B	well honey badger don't give a shit
B	yes
A	and the American badger is a completely different subspecies
B	yeah just wander round calling everything a badger
A	hey there are like four cities called Aberdeen in America
B	mm mm
A	and what's with Perth? There are Perths in the USA and I don't uh
B	that's what I've asked myself all this time
A	what is with Perth? Right there are Perths in the US and Canada
B	not really worth it is it
A	maybe hey
B	maybe they turned up there and just went this is just as shitty as it was back home
A	no I reckon Perth might have been
B	which is just like America when they first arrived
A	without stopping
B	yeah
A	but in Perth you just drive through without stopping
A	maybe in the distant past when people had to travel more slowly they all stopped in Perth
B	and I have a picture of Mushi-shi which was a movie that was out on the twenty-fourth of March
A	okay
B	and it starred Odagiri Jocirc
A	no
B	well you know what the kanji for regular mushi is?
A	yes
B	well it's just three of them
A	oh
B	yeah
A	particularly large and impressive insect then
B	I guess
A	I wish you could do that in English
B	like
A	exactly
A	I also don't seem to have any photographs of tigers here which is a shame cos I know I have some photographs of tigers somewhere
B	you were very excited
A	what do you call it when you hybridise tigers cos you know if you cross breed like a lion and a tiger it's called a liger
B	yeah
A	very bit of obvious portmanteau assembly there
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	but if you cross breed a tiger and a tiger we're gonna call it a
B	tiger
A	oh
B	but anyway
A	so apparently if you cross breed a tiger and a different kind of tiger you get a tiger with massive paws
B	well I don't know it might just have been
B	well I can't remember the last time I went to the zoo cos I thought about going to Ueno but Ueno is a sad place
A	mm mm
B	all the animals look unhappy
A	so I met this cross bred tiger
B	right
A	and I said to him what's it like being a cross bred tiger and he said well I have huge paws
B	I hate you
B	yeah
A	that is a classic of comedy
A	which Tanabata?
B	well Tanabata Tanabata in July
A	like like no particular year just a random
B	oh two thousand and six Tanabata
B	just of all the wishes hanging on the trees
A	what a heart warming wish
B	I wish to win the lottery
A	I think you have to buy a ticket first
B	well actually Mum buys a ticket every week
A	yeah but doesn't mean she'd give us anything if she won
B	well it depends
A	did you help her pick numbers this time?
B	I did actually
A	you've gotta do that
B	I usually try not to pick them rhythmically so I I don't like go this then this then this and a certain number in each column because I tend to bunch them up together cos the balls tend to fall that way
B	well
A	like
B	yeah but they do bunch up
A	it it appears that way
B	yeah
A	random
B	I know that
A	oh I just found a whole series of photographs I took of a cat sitting on top of the offering box at a temple in Kyoto
B	that sounds like you
A	they're great pictures
B	that is very true
B	oh no you're not gonna do that again
A	we have a cat
B	priests don't like cats as much as you do
B	uh-huh
A	I bet none of the sites have a cat standing on a church altar
B	you are actually doing exactly what I thought you were doing
B	it could advertise church bingo nights
A	do churches really have bingo nights I mean really
B	in
A	does she go to church bingo nights?
B	she goes to pretty much anything the church does
A	do I have to start being nice about bingo now?
B	um actually I don't think she really likes bingo
A	well it is
B	well not any more
A	she would be quite correct in that assessment
B	well
A	if you're drunk
B	well basically going out having a drink and maybe you get a chance to win some money I mean I
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and drink and have a chance to win some money although a a lower chance because you're drinking and someone there isn't but I guess the main difference there is poker is a bit classier than bingo right
B	but you have a greater chance of losing money
A	it's just bingo halls are just so grim
B	do you know that for a fact?
A	Don't you remember the one we walked past in
B	mm mm
B	pictures of  people on their nights out look crap
A	but but those ones
B	they only mean anything to people who were there at the time
A	they they they were supposed to be marketing their place and they've got these photographs of these people and it's like are you an aging working class woman? Drown your sorrows with bingo
B	okay
A	much better models you know
B	well I think they were actually taking picture of
A	for example
B	of people having fun saying you could have fun too like this or you could still get a picture
A	do you have a terrible fake tan? It's like you can make a case for photographing natural people and you can make a
B	clearly you've never seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
A	well yes exactly
B	with everything
A	these beach photos here but all the beach photos I've ever taken seem to be rain
B	I've got some really nice pictures of the um of the
A	it's just always raining in beach photos
B	sunset reflecting in the kind of wash in in the sea
A	yeah
B	mm
A	one would presume he was pretty cold
B	and here I have taken a picture of pudding in a can
A	what is it? Is it actually like creme caramel or is it some other flavour?
B	yeah it's
A	that's interesting
B	I'm very impressed
A	and they mean interesting in the sort of polite way of saying that is a terrible and hideous thing
A	was it good?
B	mm it's not bad
A	I got pretty much put off all the whole sort of like you know jelly in can kind of drinks and all those
B	mm mm
A	kind of things did I tell you that story?
B	no I don't think so
A	well I went to buy some Dr Pepper from this vending machine
B	oh you got the wrong one and you got
A	yeah the vending machine was misloaded and I got this aloe vera drink so I thought well I have it now
B	no it wasn't lumps of jelly it's it's lumps of aloe
A	well that's worse
B	is it?
A	but because I wasn't expecting any such thing it was quite a shock
B	I believe it is some some are edible some aren't
A	I hope it was the edible kind
B	well yeah
B	well you know there's a
A	that's true yeah
B	think people were a little bit embarrassed that it wasn't from China this time
A	what the
B	yep that's the one
B	no no not that you look terrible
A	oh I see
B	yes it was
A	were you you cook it
B	yeah it does I guess it does look terrible as a raw
A	yep it does look terrible
A	I can never remember the difference
B	uh there was
A	mm mm
B	these are from Autumn two thousand and seven by the way
A	just everything so far
B	well no just this this block of stuff
A	got it
A	Good idea
A	um yeah go ahead
B	but it's dark in here
A	yeah but can still leave the curtains open
B	mm
A	light is healthy
B	alright
A	um yes it's gonna take a while to sort through all of these and I've also somehow mis-sorted a whole bunch of them
B	I'm gonna do about three folders a day which will probably take long enough
A	it will take quite some time yes
B	well I'm getting to P now
B	no  as in  as in P in the alphabet P
B	and P is full of
A	oh you named your folders photo photos
B	yeah well you you did when you found all those folders all over the place
A	that's right when when I was compiling all of the stuff that you'd just sort of
B	yeah
A	stashed  like a  like a photo squirrel
A	the photographer may be considered as similar to the squirrel in behaviour
B	uh-huh
A	in storing up stock imagery for the winter
B	are you telling me to make it?
A	no I'm just observing it would be a good idea
B	okay well let me just finish off this folder and then I will go and make it then
A	okay well I might come and help actually
B	right
A	or get some other stuff done
