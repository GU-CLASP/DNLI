A	well dad you know that you you didn't let her have the money you you evil mean man
A	but no what a lie
B	mm
A	mm
B	and in fact she should have stopped me from
A	yeah if she you asked her do you want some money? and she said no
B	no
A	so you put it in a savings bond
B	well it were only a one year bond so it's not as though it's going to be
A	how much does oh god how much extra money is nan gonna make out of this bond?
B	well well she's got some in she's got some in her long term stuff which is in
A	yeah it's not like growing quite a lot
A	yeah
B	but I've left it here there there's no point in
A	mm
B	she likes that and the interest so there's no point in saying it
A	yeah
B	so and then she's got
A	mm
B	and about
A	mm
B	she's got about a hundred and twenty-five thousand in cash well near

B	she's got
A	and then there's six in her current
B	forty-three
A	you forgot
B	yeah well that's the big one and I don't know how much that is but the whole lot comes to about a hundred and twenty-five of which half of this is
A	why doesn't she have it all in one place? or is it that just not very er
B	well
A	yeah
B	they only get seventy-five thousand out so I make sure
A	oh yeah
B	that there isn't more than seventy-five
A	mm
B	is what I buy
A	yeah
B	five thousand or ten thousand or twenty thousand into simple as that
B	yeah see I have no idea what where that's invested it's probably
A	that's in it's just a Nationwide account then
B	it's probably sitting in an account earning nothing
A	yeah and I was just like
B	I dunno where that money is and I dunno what it's invested in
A	mum's got it
B	yeah well so I haven't got I haven't got a clue it's just probably just drifting along doing nothing
A	but erm did you the spend seventy pounds

A	yeah but you don't literally need an Iphone dad you just need erm a phone that can access the internet
B	oh right
A	an Android phone a Nokia phone any of them will access the internet
B	yeah anyway I managed to do it but I was really impressed about the system and
A	so where did you drop it?
B	in the garage

A	I haven't been in the
B	so
