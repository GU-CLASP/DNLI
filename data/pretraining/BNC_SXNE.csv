A	I'm a bit neanderthal with regards to what I've seen and what I haven't seen so some of things erm
B	sit down there
A	are actually is that recording now?
C	yeah
A	oh it is okay so some of the films like Pulp Fiction
C	yeah think I've still got it actually
A	yeah and that was John Travolta wasn't it? he was in that wasn't he?
C	yeah yeah
A	so I remember cos I remember this poster on
C	had the box set of do you remember? it's the there was the three at the time that were his main films there was Reservoir Dogs which was his first one
A	Pulp ah yeah is that violent as well?
C	yeah
A	right
B	oh yes
A	mm mm
B	made a fuss about didn't it? that it was a bit violent?
C	yeah yeah I think at the time I would've been seven
B	yeah yeah
C	but er
A	thank goodness you didn't watch it you didn't watch it did you?
C	when I was seven?
C	no
A	well I wouldn't've given you permission
C	unless you took me
A	no I didn't and I wouldn't've given you permission to watch it either
C	there was no downloading back in them days
A	no god
C	erm then there was Pulp Fiction
A	mm
C	about ninety-five I think that was and then there was another one called Jackie Brown as well
A	no I don't know Jackie Brown
C	have you seen that? you'd probably like Jackie Brown it's less violent erm but it's it's got a lot of like soul music in it which is really good
A	oh right oh no I'll have to say I'll have to say to
C	mm it's
A	well I mean the he said he said Pulp Fiction's a good story he said it's got that
C	it just it's still
A	he said it's got three stories interwoven into into the
C	yeah yeah Pulp Fiction's really Pulp Fiction was my favourite film for a very long time
A	yeah
C	Quentin Tarantino was one of my favourite directors but erm since then he's
A	mm
C	which was really over the top violence but that's what that's what he does and that's what he's very good at he's broken all these records for the most use of fake blood in films and stuff like that and
B	oh
A	mm
C	Kill Bill that was another one
A	oh yeah
C	think that's really good and that's
A	kung fu they're kung fu though aren't they? they're martial arts they're not you know
C	and yeah yeah yeah and so there's a girl in that that wears a yellow
B	oh
C	it's very good
A	well that's the thing I mean although you know it's fake blood it's still quite gory to watch and
C	yeah definitely
A	unless it's really relevant to the plot and I mean we don't use guns in the UK and I just think do you know what? I really don't wanna see people having their heads blown off it's really
C	well Jackie Brown is more of a it's still it's more of a heist type film
A	right
C	there's still bits of violence but it's no it's nowhere near as gory as erm like Reservoir Dogs or
A	right but you enjoyed The Hateful Eight? well you thought it was a good film
C	yeah yeah I thought it was brilliant
C	especially for long films
A	cos three hours it was three hours long
B	oh
C	yeah
B	oh that's too
A	it's too long
C	I usually struggle with films that are long but Quentin Tarantino's er I'll always watch them they're just
A	mm
B	well I erm I think a lot of the things you know on on TV that I watch
C	my they're my favourites
B	are two hours and sometimes I think oh it's even that's too long
C	yeah
B	remember when when my mother used to babysit for us and we'd come back and we'd say you know and she'd say it's it's too long two hours and I begin to feel the same like two hours is long and but that's not necessarily a film it's just erm
A	oh an
B	yes yes
C	yeah
B	like John John Judge John Deed you
A	Martin he he used to be the Bodie and Doyle in The Professionals that was a series that was probably nineteen seventies
B	that's right that's right
A	and
B	you'd never recognise them would you?
A	Martin Shaw
B	he had lots of curly hair
A	now he's gone on and done quite a lot more hasn't he?
B	oh yes yes
C	is he
A	no
C	oh I don't know who he is
A	don't not really does
B	and it's been a
A	cos he's a high court judge isn't it?
B	yes and and Jenny Seagrove's like his love interest and she's a barrister and it's their on-off affair as well and gets them into bother and you know then they whoever they've caught you know he's doing and and the others because he's kind of erm more outspoken and does different things that they don't like him doing erm and he's always got women on the go and these others you know that are kind of erm one's a home secretary and the other one was interfering and there it was trying to pull him down they want to get him off the circuit you know cos they don't like him and so on and he's always one step ahead and he always wins in the end you know so erm it's good but er that's been on now that's it but
A	they're very clever aren't they? very cleverly written
B	yeah yeah yes they're very good
A	when you think about
B	but that's two hours I don't mind that cos I
A	no
B	cos I think it's good
A	it keeps you
B	yeah depends what you're watching doesn't it?
C	yeah mm
B	but I wouldn't watch probably what you watch
C	probably not
B	I've probably not heard of them you see I mean
C	yeah
B	I was mentioning erm Martin Shaw in and then I think he's coming into something soon you know cos he's oh and he did another one that was erm
C	yeah yeah right shall I put the kettle on?
A	I was just gonna say
B	oh I thought you might
A	yeah
B	I thought you might
A	yeah
B	there's some cake there and there's some biscuits which I don't know if they've gone soft or not you'll have to tell me
A	well well I've just brought the end of a
C	I like steak
A	pardon?

A	you like steak well he's just you know when you
B	I think everybody does but
A	I

C	but he did cos you wouldn't've let him have it how does he have it? medium rare or?
A	actually no he
C	does he?
A	and I just said give him
C	do you have yours well done?
A	then I just said give me the smallest one and normally I would grill it but he got it with a pack of sort of garlic butter or whatever it happened to be
B	had it in a frying pan and
A	were frying it yeah so we just did roasted
C	it was nice to fry them
A	yeah yeah it was actually very it was tasty
C	nice to treat yourself every now and again

B	well it's where
C	oh yeah
B	they show her five
C	yeah
B	and
C	I think I have I think I've seen that
B	and then she goes out
A	goes for three different meals
B	yeah and they they do the cooking and the blokes you know? mean they
B	and the girl's saying that to the camera mushrooms you know and he's in the kitchen and she oh I didn't say I didn't like mushroom and she you know and then they when it comes like this pile of mushrooms on the side and and she
B	I suppose so I suppose so and then at the end of course for the
A	well nobody has to cook they both they just go out to a restaurant don't they?
B	they go to erm
A	yeah yeah
B	and the other two there's a
A	well it's either a him or a her that's doing the choosing isn't it? so there's one time it might be a girl that's choosing and another time it might be a guy
B	yeah that's right
C	mm
B	as well it
A	oh right oh so they've had gay couples as well
B	oh yeah yeah
A	oh well I'm sure they will do
B	erm and then they go out for a meal to a restaurant you see but you see him knocking on the door with a
C	mm
B	and sometimes they say oh lovely my favourite they say or they look and they say oh crumbs and you see some of them they just stick it into the bin you know
B	or you see them putting it in the microwave and then they sit eating it and they say well I thought he'd've picked me really but never mind erm er good luck to him you know if he picks er
B	whoever he picks good luck you know and then you see them having their meal and how they're getting on then they talk to them separately and and they
C	mm
A	cos at the end it just says there's a little thing that comes up that says
A	they had another date doesn't does it say they had a they or they didn't or they're still not said or they're both still single or whatever they said
B	yes yeah
C	lived happily ever after
A	yeah
A	well do you think they just do it? I don't know if they actually get paid cos you have to apply to join these things as far as I'm aware
B	supposed to be
A	do you want this meringuey thing or not?
C	oh you got a meringuey thing?
A	well I brought this I was saying about this roulade that I got this
B	oh we're open to offers
A	well well it's

C	alright alright
A	do you not want leftovers?
C	no I'll have leftovers
A	you'll have leftovers you'll have leftovers won't you?
B	oh yes anything that's like
C	so I was thinking about the other day do you remember when er at Scouts we made a spaghetti bolognese and you came into the Scout hut you
A	good lord did we? did we? and you see there's me having a
C	yeah cos this er for a badge cooking badge or summat in Scouts
B	yeah I suppose so yeah
C	and er I remember being in the kitchen in that little hut making a meal and you came and ate it
A	oh I seem to vague I'm vague vague memories but that must've been a long time ago for me to
C	yeah
C	cos I remember the old one don't remember the
A	oh my goodness how strange cos I remember doing something was it my Brownie or Guide cook's badge? and I had to go along to somebody's didn't I have to make
A	didn't I? you shouldn't
C	oh yeah
B	you know the dentist that used to be at the corner of
C	it's alright
B	oh no
B	I thought he'd switched off
C	which er? is that the dentist we used to go to?
A	well
C	yeah yeah long long time ago that
B	mm mm
A	well didn't you say she'd she'd mellowed a little bit? and didn't you say she was erm?
B	oh she's making a right
B	I'm got not in joining in anymore
B	I've given up
B	I remember when we we lived on on
B	oh I said switch that off and get rid of it that's
C	what was he recording that for?
C	mm
B	say something so
A	well I think we all don't sound like we think we sound when
B	no I don't know
A	we record it so
C	no I think it's cos the sound resonates in your in your head
B	maybe maybe
A	well you'd have to just make sure you think about it and say it later
B	oh that looks nice thank you
A	well it is actually it's quite it's quite
C	mm good
B	this card that I'm supposed to be writing
A	Tesco Finest so it's er if you like slightly more erm
B	I'm getting used to Tesco I mean I always call Tesco but I mean I only went to Sainsbury's because I like I prefer parking on the flat and not going round that horrible concrete
A	well I I think Sainsbury's is is quite expensive I went in the other day for some bits and pieces and
B	what was more expensive? anything?
A	Sainsbury's
B	oh
A	mm I mean I like it I like the store and it's a nicer shopping experience but
C	mm
A	everything seemed to be more expensive to my mind
C	yeah they have more erm like two for two pound and stuff like that rather than just discounting the prices
A	just buy something on their own yeah
C	mm Tesco's Finest steak dinners
B	well
C	very posh
B	lovely
A	not really it was just me making an effort because
C	pushing the boat out
A	I often buy that two for ten dining two for ten pounds from Marks And Spencer's which is really
C	that's good that
C	mm
A	mm and you get a bottle of wine as well
C	it's a bit limited what
A	of course yeah
C	because
A	well mm
C	she she can't have lasagne either so we've not had lasagne for a long time
C	although actually I think
C	of course cos it's got wheat in it
C	I think we've got I think someone I think her grandma gave us some gluten-free lasagne sheets
A	oh
C	years ago
A	mm
C	must've gone off by now
A	not used them?
A	well
C	yeah
B	what? a what?
A	paella Marks And Spencer's do this dining two for ten pounds
B	oh yeah?
A	you can have
B	but don't you get wine
B	mm
A	a dessert and a bottle of wine for ten quid which is very good value
C	mm
B	I see them advertised but
A	mm
C	I think we've had it once actually
A	mm
C	can't remember what we had
A	erm
B	but when they they used to do these on this Dinner Date sometimes you know they're dishing it up and there's a plate with so much you know erm pasta
A	well I suppose if you if you give people too much and they feel obliged to eat it
A	last Saturday
A	erm
B	who was this?
B	oh yes
A	mm
B	mm
A	so
B	did she ask you beforehand?
A	ask what?
B	is there anything you don't?
A	no that's what I'm saying she didn't ask so
B	oh
A	I was only a bit worried cos
C	is he?
A	yeah and I just thought oh no I hope
B	mm
A	we'd be noticeably
A	the lasagne was was
B	ah right
A	it's just like his mum makes and so he was
B	was it nice?
A	very nice it was lovely
B	mm
C	I'll have to give that a go
A	mm
C	chopped eggs
A	in fact I think
C	is it like Parmesan or something?
A	no it was
C	not Parmesan what's it called?
A	erm
C	that fancy ham that we have
A	oh no
A	Parmesan's cheese
A	erm it you mean the raw stuff?
C	er maybe
A	Parma ham?
C	Parma ham Parma ham
A	I
A	it was nice and I think it was a Jamie Oliver recipe
C	mm mm
A	so then we all had the conversation about Jamie Oliver's thirty minute meals
C	really?
A	not that I've made any thirty minute meals but everybody has
C	they don't take thirty minutes
A	and
C	mm
A	everyone loves Jamie Oliver and they're more than happy to do his meals but they don't take thirty minutes
C	yeah they are nice though er
A	mm
C	creative and original
A	well I think this lasagne dish was out of
C	okay
A	cos he did like a tour didn't he? and he did an Italian
C	mm
A	thing so
C	we've got a ticket a voucher actually for his erm Jamie's Italian in
A	mm
B	oh
A	oh that's nice is that the one on
C	mm
A	yeah I believe it's nice
C	yeah
A	well
C	what his er his fancy one? is that where it is?
A	well there's one there is one in Brighton
C	or the Jamie's Jamie's Italian?
A	mm
C	oh okay er cos there there's a few of them there's a couple in London and but he does have a proper gastro whatever restaurant as well
A	oh right okay
C	you know where he works and
A	oh where he actually hangs out?
C	I think
A	and cooks or directs people to cook
C	think so yeah
A	mm cos I mean I like Jamie Oliver he's and he's a he's he does champion
C	pukka
A	good causes doesn't he? with
C	mm
A	regards to diets and
C	that's what he's on about mm
A	at school meals he did some good work
C	mm
A	erm to try and alter the
A	erm
C	used to eat a lot pizza and
C	used to eat a lot of pizza and chips and garlic bread
B	mm very nice that
A	mm
C	at school
A	you did? did you?
C	oh you never took an interest did you?
A	he's talking about school meals and
B	oh
C	chips gravy
A	mm
C	very unhealthy
A	you don't you can't choose for your children you can't say I insist that you have the salad at lunchtime cos they don't want it do they?
C	unless you give them a packed lunch and don't give them any money
A	well we did do that
C	mm
A	I'm not surprised
A	I have a packed lunch and
A	here I'm healthy
A	cos I've made sure that I only take cottage cheese
B	yeah
A	my Ryvita
B	uhu
A	my fruit and nuts
B	well I think you do get into a habit don't you? with them
B	I used to find that after so long I mean for ages and ages they used to have Ryvita and
A	mm
B	cheese on it and whatnot and thought nothing about it then but when I think now I think god
B	how I kept eating that for ages but I think I I think I'm a bit like that now with things
A	but Ryvita have you can now buy Ryvita in lots of different formats so
B	oh yes I suppose so
A	it it's more exciting than it ever was and I'm just on my quest to buy Longley Farm cottage cheese cos
B	mm
A	and if I ever run out and I can't get to a supermarket that has
B	do you do without?
A	Longley Farm well I I've had a
B	would you like to switch that
A	mm
B	you know cos
B	eventually that's probably when I fall
A	well
C	mm
A	it's tropical temperatures do you just turn it off at at the plug? or do you turn it off?
B	just switch it off on the plug just
A	right
C	are your radiators okay at the moment? they coming on at the right times and warming up?
B	oh yes
C	just a bit of a boost is that
A	oh have you got a camper van T-shirt?
B	yes
A	ooh
B	a what T-shirt?
A	oh it's not a camper van it's a VW Golf T-shirt
B	I was gonna say that's a
C	oh yeah it's a Golf?
C	yeah
A	isn't that the one that
C	she does yeah
C	I think
A	well she possibly did
C	maybe
A	and that's the only car I've ever heard her ever
C	but erm think she's going off the idea of a Golf now
A	okay
A	are you? is yours?
C	when ours packs in
A	oh right
C	at the moment it's like got booked it in on Wednesday again cos it sounds like a boy racer car at the moment
A	oh no but you've just paid lots of money out haven't you?
C	it's mm
A	oh
C	it's a
A	is it worth it?
C	yeah that's a shame
A	is it worth it? to spend more money
C	depends how much it is to get
A	well why don't you ring
C	cos he's too far away
B	what? to tell you what?
A	well no it's because I'd spent money
B	yeah
A	it was just
B	mm
A	erm and they paid
B	oh god that's that's an enormous amount isn't it?
B	you expect that hundred and twenty or something don't you of?
C	yeah that was including the MOT and service
B	yeah
A	but but then you were hoping it would last you a year weren't you?
C	yeah
A	but it might now
B	I
A	I know but I think it's probably from a business point of view for
B	it sort of says
A	he probably doesn't
B	yes I know that
A	you can lose touch with you
B	I've never complained about what he's charged or anything cos I'm sure
A	oh not at all not at all I just think you just lose touch with him sometimes and I think he he kind of but he would come and he would do it and he usually would pick your car up from your
C	it's too far out far afield for him to come and pick it up
A	yeah
C	it's too far to for him to come here to drop it off and
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I know I do you
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	you see for the
A	well he's handy cos he lives locally isn't he?
B	yes yes yeah
B	oh yes he has he has
A	oh but we got we went to try your car didn't we? we got in we got in well
B	we did both get in actually and
A	we did actually eventually
B	you got in the passenger seat
A	driver's seat
B	when we when you moved the seat forward
A	they forget
C	mm
B	erm and then the
A	well the key
B	I couldn't use the blooming
A	no well to start off with the key well it's completely dead anyway but the key erm the key wouldn't open the door so that was
C	yeah
A	the
C	cos the battery's gone
A	erm so then I said well we'll undo the door
B	with the key
A	er with key which so we we undid the door and then mum got in so you were able to get in weren't you?
B	yeah
B	totally blank on the
C	yeah
A	erm but then I got in cos we were messing with the handbrake weren't we? because you couldn't do the handbrake
B	yeah I couldn't even get the but then
B	it works all the time it really does
B	but it was it
A	well I undid it didn't I? and then I put it back on again
B	you managed it
A	and
B	yeah
A	then you couldn't do it but then I I put it on
B	not so
A	a little well quite slack
B	yeah you see I like I was telling the
C	does he not?
A	well he's he's an orthopaedic man
C	right
A	I mean he's very very he's lovely isn't he? he's really nice really nice
B	mm you get the handshakes and all you know yeah
A	Mr
C	oh Mr
A	yeah yeah
B	and a couple of gooks with him honestly a boy and a
A	well they must've been training but
B	I said good morning to them they both stood there and looked at me as though I was stupid you know
B	and then lastly I was talking occasionally when I thought it was suitable kind of I'm telling him and then sort of looking at them I got not a pip out of either of them not even a you know?
C	mm
B	they must be terrified of him or else
A	think they no they're probably just terrified of the patient and terrified of the whole concept of thinking about operating on people or whatever they're training to do
B	well I should think by by the time oh I don't know I don't know how far along the line they're going remember
B	erm
B	and he was loving you know and it's
B	kind of you know holding on to this limb or whatever it was and and she said that when they
A	well that's lovely it's that's really good he's obviously got the enthusiasm and he's
B	he's full of enthusiasm
A	yeah he's
B	if it lasts till he becomes a doctor
A	well no but that's that's good that he's he's keen and that he's
B	it is
A	he's interested and he wants to do that that's
B	mm
C	mm
A	cos it's a long training lot of long time in training isn't it understandably?
C	mm
B	mm mm
A	but mum went because I was working on Friday and I couldn't get I couldn't change it
B	mm
A	erm mum went in the the you rang for the ambulance
C	oh right
B	oh it was great I were
B	yeah
C	mm
B	because on the on my notes I'd got
A	it didn't
B	it hadn't got an apartment number it'd just got
C	oh right
B	number thirty so they didn't know which to press you see I thought I think
B	don't ever buy a flat flat number one don't
B	but you see she likes to look at everything doesn't she? and looks at all the bins and I'll do it for you you know?
A	she is the bin police she actually is the
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah which is yeah
B	so we had we went to
C	oh right
B	loads and loads of streets and
C	mm
B	she said what was my name? and I said oh she said
B	and er so I said what's your what's your name? and she said erm
A	yeah
B	I said right so
B	when we came back
A	mm yeah it was
B	with this young woman that drove us back in her car erm was just straight up
A	oh they'll've just gone a different route won't they? because
B	heavens above oh it was ages
A	yeah
B	just about got there just about quarter past ten which was my time you know? but coming back then erm she picked me up and it was so near and I'd
A	transportation
B	yes that's right but she was nice and it was a nice car but heck it was
C	mm
B	cor there wasn't much room at all and I said oh I said
B	she had to kind of
B	I got as far as I could and she had to get hold of my foot and lift my right one in and then lift my left one in and then after that she she fastened my seatbelt and that was it so the next thing we went to the
B	can you hold a stick? and can you? can you hold my coat and then I can perhaps see if I can't manage to cos she was a big woman
B	all down
C	mm
A	Times Square isn't it? is it the big?
C	mm
A	it is a big celebration isn't it the
B	it is I think isn't it?
A	I think they drop the
C	yeah
A	there's a big
C	big ball on a stick
A	ball isn't there that they drop?
B	there's a what?
B	oh right
A	that that drops and
B	mm
A	and
C	on top of a building
A	pardon?
C	is it is is it on top of a building or is it?
A	yes I think yes it is
C	mm
A	yeah yeah
C	I've heard they have to you have to queue up from sort of
A	to get a space in Times Square
C	to yeah to be able to see it and you're not allowed to leave so you can't
B	ah
C	go to the toilet or anything like that
A	oh so you can't really drink much
C	mm
A	not really that much fun is it then if you can't really
C	sounds pretty pretty
A	have a nice cup of coffee
A	and some nice sugary food
B	said to
A	it's a nice a nice erm
C	mm
B	but the only thing I mean it works fine and I'm quite happy now so if I have to do it again I'll I'll know because I had to be
C	mm
B	so course there I am ready before eight o'clock and had to wait till about quarter past nine twenty past nine when they came
C	oh really?
B	not that it mattered I mean as long as you're ready that's all that matters really isn't it?
C	yeah
A	just depends how many people they've got to pick up and where from
B	that's right
A	cos obviously if they're driving all around the area and if they're driving around
B	yeah yeah
A	mid
B	it was just the
A	rush hour traffic
B	it's just waiting cos
C	mm
B	but you know there's only by the time you know it was
A	did you wait about an hour did you
C	mm
B	yes about an hour
A	yeah
B	but by this time the ones that were left you see they were all getting quite agitated because they were so late you know?
C	mm
B	you know what it's like when you go in there's lots of people there and then they all keep going in and out in and out and nobody calls your name and
A	yeah people are watching the clock
B	anyway eventually they got seen and they came back and as she came back she went
A	that wasn't it wasn't it kind though? I thought that was really cos people normally just
C	mm
B	cos they were fed up they'd been there all morning you know and
A	well yeah
A	people are kind aren't they? you know you just think that there are sort of
B	ready to get home
C	yeah
B	but your dad would've done that you see
A	he would've absolutely absolutely
B	mm ah
A	the kindness of strangers
B	and course the telly goes on and so you've all got your head turned like
A	reading the subtitles cos you can't hear it or
C	er it's been alright yeah
A	have you started your new
C	mm yeah
A	ooh oh cos you was that your meeting in
C	yeah yeah that's the first one
B	oh
C	yeah
B	in the picture now
C	yeah
B	oh that's probably good isn't it like that?
A	well it's variety isn't it?
C	yeah it was yeah I think it's good
A	I think and it also keeps erm
B	yes
A	it keeps you kind of
B	in the link with what you've been doing
A	in with a
B	yes
C	yeah
A	good experience and
C	yeah
A	erm
C	yeah yeah yeah it's good
A	mm so how how is the new? are you just sort of getting your head around the new
C	yeah yeah and er tomorrow I've gotta hand over some
A	oh yeah yeah
C	now he's left
A	yeah
C	so I kind of was doing
A	oh
A	but it's easier for you to get into
C	yeah it's easier than getting to
A	do you still cycle or do you go in
C	no it's
A	mm
C	I can access the showers with my key but I can't
B	oh no no
C	I can't fit enough stuff in my bag I'd have to
A	yeah
C	then just leave them there all the time
B	yes yes
C	just bring like my shirts and stuff but
B	mm
C	without a locker I can't it's too much stuff it doesn't fit in my bag so I can't really do it
A	mm
B	no
C	and I cos I've got that at
A	mm
A	mm mm
B	how long does it take you to go to
C	erm well I drove
B	oh
C	er in a hire car and it was about
B	ah
C	cos it's it was at
B	uhu
C	erm and it's a bit difficult to get to on public transport but it took about a good two hours cos in the traffic
B	ah
A	see that's the problem isn't it? no matter where you go the traffic is er is so heavy
B	yeah yeah you got
A	so did you enjoy driving the hire car because?
C	yeah it was nice for a change
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	something that well goes without making a noise and
A	mm
C	Astra
A	oh right okay they're quite nippy aren't they? the
C	yeah it was one point six as well so it was pretty good
A	mm
B	mm mm
C	but erm yeah I've been
B	good
C	been looking at something like a
A	Fiesta were when I was looking for mine Fiesta were the top small car
C	yeah
A	erm I was looking on What Car?
B	were they?
A	yeah erm yeah yeah cos
C	mm she got a Corsa
A	oh maybe that she doesn't then
B	oh
A	on the on his Fiesta but
C	mm
A	he he really likes it but they did win the the sort of the award or whatever that
C	yeah
A	when I was looking for mine
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	cos I remember the Fiesta because erm
B	er
C	yeah
B	what they're like now
A	well it's
C	they're bigger than they used to be
B	yes
A	erm I we we've had this conversation in fact I did with
C	mm
A	Yaris used to be a small car
B	mm
A	it's now a bigger Yaris than it was before
B	oh is it?
A	and your Fiestas your Renault the Renault the Renault Clio
B	mm
C	mm
A	is now a bigger Renault Clio so whatever you buy that's a small car
C	mm mm
A	it's not actually that small but
C	mm
A	then if you do need
B	mm
A	might be
C	well that's what I thought I
A	yeah
C	which well Golfs are too are too expensive for what they are plus this whole cheat device
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	scandal
A	yeah
C	is a bit off-putting as
B	mm
C	as well so maybe a
A	well
C	body shape
A	yeah they have cos I was saying oh it has the engine of a Volkswagen doesn't it? cos it does doesn't it?
C	is the whole the whole thing chassis the all the Seat
A	yeah they do
C	for the sort of from the little hatchbacks to the saloons
B	yeah
A	cos I was saying I was saying this to
C	mm
A	and it just must
B	mm
A	erm
C	mm
A	cheat
B	yes yes
A	saying that their emissions are better than
B	well I bet they've lost a lot of you know potential customers
C	well yeah
B	people will go won't they?
A	well it'll be it'll be very very bad for business very bad for business but
B	yes it will
A	but Volkswagen are such a sought after
B	yes yes that's right
A	car and everybody loves the Golf in fact the Golf was the number the people's car did you see the James May?
C	yeah yeah
A	that you see that tells you to
B	mm oh really?
A	to buy a Volkswagen Golf cos everybody wants a Volkswagen Golf but if you want a GTI those are the ones that people want to steal off you so
C	yeah
A	it's probably not good to have a GTI unless you really want to have that engine erm
B	so who makes that?
A	Volkswagen
B	it's a Volkswagen one?
A	mm and I was
B	oh
A	telling I was telling
C	mm
A	she was just saying she said she said I'm not having she cos they don't really worry that much about well she she
B	well I thought it
A	well that's what I'm saying
B	yeah
A	I said cos I mean
A	so she was thinking something along the lines of a Volkswagen but she said they were expensive she we were talking about the Polo and the Golf and said she said the same thing they're expensive they don't want another Seat because they've already got one so she wanted something
B	mm
A	and she said that she'd had a Scirocco cos I said I don't like the Sciroccos
C	mm
A	and
B	are they expensive? are they high are they high? er
A	well
B	er
A	be high insurance group I think and I think that's what because I was when I was looking it was kind of I was like mm a little bit well I mean I
B	but you were talking about the Yaris weren't you for quite a while?
A	well I was because I do like the Yaris
B	mm
A	and the Yaris in fact if you if you're looking for reliability er Honda and Toyota
C	yeah
A	are the most what did I say? yeah
C	most of most of the Japanese sort of you know Eastern
A	yeah I'd
B	but Honda were were erm
A	reliable
B	yes yes
C	mm
A	well my cousin's got the Jazz and but and she likes the car but she's now saying not that she just she just said
B	modern?
B	oh
A	little bit more cool is what I mean trying to move back to cool cool now so
B	yeah
A	well no you do it's all in the mix but then you also want to enjoy driving it
B	mm
A	you spend a lot of money on it and
B	depends how much money you've got doesn't it?
A	yes absolutely yeah this is it
C	yeah
B	what did he say?
A	he's got you got a reputation to protect which is why I would say
B	mm
A	I mean Ford Focus are very erm reliable I would've thought
B	that's a Ford isn't it the Focus?
A	it is Ford and
C	a Focus?
A	mm
C	you think?
A	mm
B	it probably sounds to me like a
A	I kinda that's that's that's my image but
B	like a like a Ford ordinary you know dead
B	ordinary car you know not
C	mm
B	don't worry about what it looks you know if it's cool or otherwise the sort of car that people would
C	yeah
A	well I suppose nobody wants to mug you for the keys
B	no
C	well it the new models have they do
A	do they?
C	they were on Top Gear there was this they called it the er
A	mm
C	the ASBO cos it was this bright orange thing
A	oh
B	what was that?
B	they what?
C	Top Gear called the
B	oh
C	you know
B	oh yeah
C	cos it was a bit of a a bit of a boy racer car
A	well I did look at the Honda Civic and I do like the Honda well I I like I like the Honda Civic have you thought about a Honda Civic?
C	yeah I like I like it as well erm but then
A	well I would definitely look at one of those I did go and sit in one
C	the problem is the
A	the only thing that I found was I didn't I wasn't sure visibility was that great so
C	it's got that bar across the back window hasn't it?
A	yeah
C	that's I probably wouldn't like that
A	and also there there's to me the bonnet sloped off and I couldn't see the front of the car
B	yeah
A	and that I didn't I didn't particularly like so but I do like the
C	mm
A	I like the look of the car I think it's a
C	yeah well
A	you tend to go and you find something and you think oh yes this will be okay but
B	yeah
A	you don't do enough
B	yeah
A	looking about researching and
C	yeah well I'm just
A	cos
A	oh definitely
C	the only thing I really want is like a DAB radio I'm not
A	no what about
C	as long as it's cheap
B	that's where erm
C	where's that?
A	yeah er
C	where's
A	it's
C	okay
B	yeah and they advertise as well don't they?
B	like most of them do they advertise
A	mm they do
B	mm
A	and if you can actually click on a car and they
C	is that where you got yours from?
A	no no
C	no
A	I got mine from erm
C	mm
A	so that was er that was a nice experience wasn't it? that was lovely
C	yeah I remember that guy did did the the videos and stuff
B	oh yeah
A	yes cos I sent you and
C	mm
A	they do they do the he'd made that video himself hadn't he? but
C	yeah I know
A	if you go on the
C	well I've not really looked around much
A	if
C	I've only looked on Auto Trader to
B	give you an idea of price ranges and things
C	yeah cos what I'm trying
B	mm
C	what you know the only thing I'm really bothered about is having a DAB radio so I can listen to 6 Music
A	yeah
C	and like anything else will just be so many streets ahead of what I've got now it doesn't really matter
B	mm
C	it's not massively you know my car doesn't have air conditioning
B	update the
C	or a beepy key fob
B	mm
C	and those are the probably the three
A	yeah
C	you know not not getting a Honda Jazz
A	but why
C	or something like that
A	er why don't you?
B	mm
A	why don't you well well just have a look and you'll what happens is you find you can look at a say a particular sort of if I if you want a I don't know Honda Civic particular engine
C	mm
A	they will show you everything they've got in that range and you can click on it you think yeah I want a I dunno a red one so you click on and they'll so you pick your car and then what happens is
A	therefore you click on it and and it shows you they drive it out and they tell you all about it you see so
B	what's that noise?
C	mm
A	it's quite nifty
C	I'll have to have a look
A	do have a look
C	yeah
A	and I was quite impressed I was
C	yeah yeah
A	because when I was looking at mine what I
C	mm
A	what about cos at one point I was looking at one with a glass roof and I went on to see about what people were saying about glass
C	yeah
A	about panoramic rooves and and somebody had had trouble with it and then I thought mm maybe not because if I have trouble it could be a really expensive thing to fix and I also didn't want a cabriolet because I didn't want because again
C	what's a cabriolet?
A	you know the soft top
C	oh yeah
A	so therefore that was a massively expensive thing and she got it
C	yeah
A	done for a a a reasonable price but it's still a lot of money
B	who was this?
B	oh right
A	yeah so
C	I probably wouldn't get much use of it other than a couple of days of sunshine
A	well exactly I mean there so there are certain
C	oh I've heard that the UK has has the most convertibles per capita in the world or something
B	really?
A	well that's ridiculous
C	shows shows what an optimistic country we have
A	isn't it?
B	yeah
A	absolutely so the what's the point? and also you
B	just
A	you can't you can't wash it
A	like you can't you've gotta have your special treatment and stuff for your roof
C	yeah
A	you can't just wash it like you can wash a normal car so
B	no no
A	to me that
C	mm
A	there were lots of negatives for that I mean
B	mm
A	if we suddenly get tropical you know we can think you might consider it but there's no point is there for the number of sunny days that we have these days?
B	but if you see these programmes and and
C	no
B	they're very erm
C	mm
B	everything to hand you know
C	mm
B	and there's another one on now er by the they're looking for I've forgotten what they call it the
C	mm
B	you know it's a real er after a while you get
C	yeah
B	you know they think
A	the Fixer Uppers?
B	that's it what did I say?
A	upper fixers
B	I think I was thinking upper class
B	oh that's right have you seen that?
A	no I haven't no it was just a cos that's what
B	but
A	that's a term isn't it? fixer upper? isn't it? isn't
B	is it? I suppose it's
A	well it kind of is because it's a
B	I suppose yeah yeah
A	slang for
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and then they want a mirror and you see six blokes carrying a mirror you know to put on that wall and
A	well they probably don't I bet they're all dead thin and they don't eat very much a lot of them
B	they are dead thin all of them
A	cos er all their dining out mustn't they mustn't have three courses and
B	no oh they mustn't
A	cos otherwise they would be
B	they mustn't
A	overweight
B	but you know it's all er and the nannies and
C	yeah
B	all of that and the so on but when they meet together there there's like usually for the whole thing that keeps coming on there's probably half a dozen of them that are all supposed to be friends and the way they go on about one another and in the end it's I suppose it's good television they're they're falling out you see and then they're saying is Sonia coming? and er well I
A	well yeah but that's airing your airing your that's just your life in public is it just because people want their fifteen minutes of fame?
B	I don't know
A	I can't understand why would you want to show that to the world unless you just want to show off? why would you want people in your home?
B	I don't know
A	with cameras
B	it's a big ego I suppose
A	yeah
B	cos there must be thousands of people who would go on it I'm sure
A	yeah definitely I suppose they just want to show off
B	mm
A	but no
B	and then at the end of the series they have a they get together when they sit in this you know like semi-circle and work in the middle with all the questions that people have contacted them you know to ask
A	they must dress up for the camera
B	and they're all blonde and their hair's all down to here
A	maybe it's a uniform
A	I don't know
B	anyway
A	oh what's
C	she's erm meeting the er project team for a festival called er Brainchild festival in
A	oh what's that all about then?
C	er she's volunteering and she's
A	oh fabulous
C	so
A	so is it a music festival or an arts festival or?
C	er bit of both I think
A	right and when is it?
C	July something
A	July something?
C	yeah one weekend in July
A	oh very good
C	so she got the coach at nine o'clock took about five hours to get down there
A	what? this morning?
C	yeah
A	oh what? where was the coach going from?
C	I know
A	so er did
C	yeah I gave her a lift
A	yeah
C	no nine o'clock
A	oh I thought you said five I thought
C	it's a five-hour
B	it's a five-hour
A	five-hour sorry
C	mm
A	that's me
C	erm
A	nine o'clock this morning five-hour so she won't get there till one
C	yeah and then the meeting was three I think three till five
A	okay and then
C	and she's on the coach back now and
A	oh
C	gets in about quarter to eleven I think
A	oh poor lass well good for her for doing it
C	yeah it's a long way to go
A	for making that that's a whole day out of your life isn't it? ten hours on a coach
C	yeah
A	for a two-hour meeting could it not have? could they not have done it on Skype?
B	well people would've been from all over perhaps were they
C	they're all from London
B	oh
C	effort to go
A	I think that's very impressive
C	yeah but most of the work can be done
C	while she's up here
A	oh yeah yeah that's good that's
B	well it's a space that she's got to work in
C	yeah she went she's been there for a few weeks now
B	oh
A	has she been erm
C	yeah
A	oh that's good
C	drive there so she's
A	if she wants well that's good
C	yeah
A	good so she's quite happy is she?
C	yeah yeah she's doing really well
A	good
B	mm
C	apart from the she's working at a er place called
A	yes you said they hadn't given her enough hours and
C	er been up and down then she's worked she worked
A	oh right
C	she wants to get something a bit more local and different cos it's
B	yes that would be useful wouldn't it? mm
C	yeah going from college to town and
B	yes
C	then I mean that'd be easier if she could get
B	mm
A	something more local well that's good because then if she does and she
C	yeah exactly
A	so
B	mm
A	it you know you you don't worry about sort of having to walk to the train or bus
B	mm
C	mm
A	well the train's quite good isn't it but?
C	the train's good but they're er late night they're only like once an hour and they don't run very late so last night she finished after the train had finished so
A	so she had to get the bus?
C	yeah
A	I mean you are on a quite busy bus route
C	but then we don't
A	well that that was was gonna say even though it goes through the the road down like
C	yeah mm
C	mm yeah
B	mm
A	that's not so good
C	no
A	mm
C	bit of a pain but usually she cycles but she's had three punctures in less
A	oh
C	in about a week
C	and then she got the train home and had repaired it and then by the morning the repair just failed so had to put a new inner tube in and
A	no oh that's so disheartening isn't it when she makes such an effort? I mean you both
C	yeah
A	you're both very good at at cycling but even so
C	when I took it out it was one of these cheap ones from Wilkos so I think maybe that's why cos it'd just it had this like loads of little holes along the end in it
A	oh
C	couldn't even repair it
A	oh
C	so I ordered a better quality couple of inner tubes off the internet
A	right
C	today
B	oh
A	I know but it's so it's disheartening isn't it? because I mean that's
B	mm
A	you're
B	yeah
A	but then
B	yeah
A	you're spending your wages back in inner tubes and it kind of it's a bit counterproductive isn't it?
C	well I had a couple of weeks
C	just I was = I was on the verge of giving up cycling it was
B	really?
A	oh right
B	you know
A	I
B	yeah
C	so annoying
A	well I would've done
C	I think it was just some shrapnel that was in
B	ah
C	but it's so it's hard when you're going that far to
B	mm mm
C	you know
A	and and it's really important to be safe so
C	but my new bike's a bit
A	mm
C	and the tyres are harder which I dunno maybe that makes them more resilient or maybe that makes them more resilient or maybe that
A	is it a road bike did you say?
A	so it's
A	yeah okay cos you can get the
C	I've been having these erm I'm getting this pain in my elbow
A	oh that's not that's not
C	erm
A	the shock of
C	I don't know if it's the lack of suspension and I'm not used to taking shocks on my arms
A	mm
C	the different seat
A	mm?
C	also leaning forward
B	mm
C	which means my arms are overstretched and I've got more weight of my backpack on my arms than I would have when I'm sat like that
A	mm
C	or maybe the bike's too big for me and I'm stretching further than I should be
A	mm
C	or a combination of all of the above
A	oh no so
C	so I don't know if I'm getting like
A	well I was just gonna say you'll end up with tennis elbow is the one
B	I was gonna say tennis elbow mm
A	and then you'll end up with support straps unless you put the support straps on when you're cycling but I don't know if that will help
C	well it shouldn't it shouldn't happen I just need to fix whatever's going wrong but erm
A	so if you're not
B	you'll have to keep your eye on it and see
A	no
C	cos it's a new bike I've got er they they said bring it back in a couple of months and they'll have a look over it just to make sure everything's alright
A	mm
C	but I think because I've tried I've rode I tested one bike
A	mm
C	and waited nearly six months to get it
A	oh and they sent you another they said it
C	I know then it's just got yeah so many so many delays they're just like gotta just just give me a different bike so I picked one
A	mm
C	that was very
B	no
A	it's different to to
B	yes you
C	I wouldn't how would I know if it's uncomfortable? cos it is uncomfortable because it's different
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and when I looked at the size guides
A	yeah
C	they're both fifty-four centimetres so you think they're the same size but
B	yeah yeah
C	I they're not because the frames are different shapes like different geometries
A	oh
B	oh right
C	so one size bike
A	is not you don't
C	in one brand might be different to another one
C	so the size guide they have these on the internet you can get the size guide for your for your height
A	yeah
C	you should have be on the size bike
B	yeah yeah
C	and fifty-four was right on the old one but it's not right on the new one
A	oh no
A	oh no
C	according to that
B	yeah
C	the right
B	mm
C	think it's comfortable I'm the customer and I bought a bike and it's my fault really but when I take it in to for them for them to check it
B	yeah
C	I'll just ask them and I'll say you know
A	yeah
C	yeah five foot seven should be on a fifty-two inch fifty-two centimetre bike not a fifty-four
A	mm
C	and just ask them you know did you not check
B	yeah
C	but I think there might be some options whether you can I
A	mm
B	yeah
C	moving the handlebars up or even replacing the drop bars with some flat bars might help
B	yeah
A	unlike I've done with mine well that I did a very very long time ago cos mine's a racing bike and and I had originally it came with drop handlebars but I've just had the standard handlebars put on it because
C	mm
A	I wouldn't want to have have my head down I want
C	yeah the only thing is I think it might be expensive cos I might have to get new brakes as well cos I the the brakes are special drop handlebar brakes like well you probably have the same mm
A	mm pff must've done but I kinda can't remember now
C	yeah
A	so long ago
C	just a just a bit of a pain really
A	no it is definitely
B	yeah
A	will you find it easier to
C	but no cos I'm not even I'm not even riding it every day
B	no you've got to keep your you've got to keep your eye on it haven't you? to see how
C	well yeah
B	how often it happens and how long are you driving before it cycling before it hurts or what you know it
C	it doesn't hurt when I'm cycling it's
B	er
C	it's like I've got my drink bottle that hurts like gripping
B	yeah
A	mm
C	so which is a I've read about tennis elbow that's one of the symptoms so
A	mm
C	and then this this arm's not as bad but well this arm wasn't at all but then it was mostly this one but then since started a bit as well you know it's
A	mm
C	erm
A	well somebody at work
B	and do you find the
C	no it's well I've can
B	it you'd get yeah
C	I imagine if it'd be worse if I was riding every day
B	mm
C	I think next weekend that's
B	mm
A	yeah
C	see if they can
B	yeah
A	how long have you had the bike?
C	er got it
A	right well
C	so it was only about less than a month well bit over a month
A	well why don't you see if because somebody I know bought a bike from
C	oh right
A	yeah
C	yeah I'll erm
A	or or or look up and see what their
C	what their policy is
B	mm
A	policy and
C	yeah
A	that or whatever
B	mm
C	mm
A	it's really important and it's not a good thing
B	yeah they know about it
C	mm
A	they should then know that if you've had a fifty-four frame and you you then go into a different model that they suggested or whatever that that they should know that that is not the right one or they should
C	mm
A	have that background knowledge to be able to say
B	mm
C	mm
B	and you've got to try all over again haven't you to see how it is? cos I
A	well I was gonna say I sort of vaguely remember but
B	twice
A	oh
B	and they thought it was it was because erm you know you're carrying heavy shopping they
A	oh
B	used to go on
A	good heavens
B	to this particular osteopath who was supposed to be very good
A	right
B	your daddy used to go as well
A	right
B	and but
A	so
B	eventually erm I remember on the one occasion me sitting on the edge of the like the bed like me sitting on the edge and him sitting there and he was a big chap
B	but it did and and then it was okay
A	really?
C	oh right
B	mm and we went to one before that erm
B	mm you don't hear much about them now do you?
A	a good
B	it's all physio now isn't it? seems to be
A	well mostly cos it's kinda recognised isn't it? but I don't know are
B	mm
A	osteopaths not considered
B	no anyway eventually had cancer and died
A	oh
B	I didn't need him again as as it happened I didn't
A	oh but I know
B	yeah but erm I do remember that I don't know how he'd had perhaps it was through the rugby club that somebody knew I don't I don't know
A	mm
C	mm
B	but when something hurts you see it hurts doesn't it?
C	yeah
B	it it's you know it's quite debilitating really
C	mm
B	really get you down
A	well I hope I hope you get sorted love really do
C	yeah
A	pardon?
C	I'm getting on a bit now I need to be careful
B	oh god
A	prime age for
A	don't know just prime age
C	oh yeah
A	this week
B	David Bowie
C	I listened to a really good one
A	mm
B	is he a
A	yeah he died he died last yeah
C	yeah he was
B	yeah but it didn't
A	Alan Rickman?

A	cos it was Bowie it's er there's only David Bowie that
B	Bowie Bowie
A	yeah that's what we're talking about
B	I thought you said
B	cos I've never heard of him
B	him that they'd just said he's been on too much
A	yes
B	I know that much anyway
A	oh
B	I dunno how many millions he made when he sold whatever he sold and
A	oh god
C	oh
A	no
A	yeah cos
C	mm
A	yeah to say have you and I thought heard what? no I haven't and I'm I'm really
B	mm
A	what a shame because nobody knew he was ill he had cancer didn't he?
B	no no
A	he was only
B	oh
A	latest album only a couple of days
B	yeah
A	well he'd released it on his birthday hadn't he I think?
C	mm on a Friday
A	erm yeah and then he died on the Sunday
B	there's an awful lot of them gone recently hasn't there?
B	you know notice on the telly about different
A	there's been quite a lot of people that have died this month
C	both sixty-nine died of cancer
B	who?
C	Bowie was sixty-nine died of cancer and so was Alan Rickman
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	sixty-nine cancer
A	mm
C	and er
A	that's
C	the week before there was er a guy called Lemmy who was a guitarist er in or bassist in Motörhead
A	yeah no I'd heard I'd heard yeah I'd heard about him how old was he?
C	he was seventy odd I think
A	right
B	well there's been quite a lot of the old film stars as well you know the old ones you know that I would appreciate but
A	was there one just recently? yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
B	I mean some of them their names don't really always mean very much do they?
A	but then they mention the films that they've directed or whatever and then you think oh right yeah I know
B	yes yes
A	no
B	people
C	did listen to a really good show on 6 Music this afternoon it's
A	oh
C	and it's people from the Chicago
A	oh really?
C	singing
A	oh
C	and
B	mm
A	he's really
B	that's
A	he's really well-spoken isn't he? and he's he's erm
A	cos he was he's he was born David Jones wasn't he?
C	mm
A	and
B	oh
A	er you know I went to the exhibition we went to the Bowie exhibition in erm Melbourne when I was in Australia
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	because I
B	he was quite a nice singer from what what I saw
A	he was very very good very talented
B	what I saw
A	he wrote all his own material didn't he?
B	mm mm
A	he's was really yeah and very diverse as well and
B	yes yes
A	groundbreaking and and everything very very good
B	mm mm
A	he had lots of his costumes there and
C	yeah
A	yeah and
B	oh
A	lots of erm interviews you could hear interviews you could hear
B	a lot of them seem to have gone through the rock and roll and the drugs and whatnot haven't they? and they've kind of kicked and then you know become more famous afterwards and
C	mm
B	as they've got older even
A	mm
B	I mean such a lot of them say about what they did you know then
A	they've settled down and grown up and got on with their life
B	yeah yeah
A	no it's it is but he was he was quite like I mean he is an icon isn't he? and I think
B	yeah
C	mm
A	it just is very sad cos obviously he's very talented and and
B	mm
A	you know it's ended early and and yet
B	and also you didn't hear an awful lot about him did you?
A	well he was a very private man and
C	mm
A	because
B	mm
A	he'd kept his private life private which is fine and
B	I think they're the wise ones that do
A	yeah
B	keep out of the limelight
A	yeah
B	aren't they?
A	very sad that
B	I mean look at all these blokes that have gone to prison you know and they've like Max Clifford and all
A	but then that's not it's not about that it's about the fact they've
B	no I know but
A	have been if you like erm
B	found out?
A	they've probably
B	yeah
A	advantage of situations and
B	yeah
A	that's what's really bad and other people can be famous and they can be talented and they they just use their talents and they use their
B	yeah
A	the funds that they've made not all of them obviously but they to help erm
B	oh yeah
A	and they do a lot of charity work and then
B	yes they do
A	so that's there's that's there's a nice side to it isn't there? there's a
B	yes yeah
A	and I think that's that's the best part about
B	yes if you've got money
A	well celebrity being a celebrity is that you can actually use it to help
B	help people
C	use it for good
A	other people yeah and you can use it to
B	mm
A	erm forward a cause
B	yes because they use your name it helps yeah
A	mm yeah
B	cos you see Barbara Windsor's been given a
A	yeah she has yeah
B	and you see people grumbling about that but
A	well she's done a lot of charity work hasn't she?
B	yes and that's what what they said she
A	that's why she's that's what she's gained it for isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean they don't give it them just for being an actress do they? they give it
B	no
A	they give them a erm they award them a
B	that's right yeah
A	title because of work they've done
B	yeah
A	charity work it's not
B	no
A	a good actress cos that's just somebody being good at their job isn't it?
B	I know yeah it's another world isn't it?
A	mm of course
B	than the average
A	yeah absolutely we yeah yeah they're not average people are they?
B	not really no
A	but then there's a lot of erm I suppose a lot of people that have been
B	but you always thought that they were nice and they
A	yeah they'd been a big part of
B	yeah
A	like when you were were growing up
B	you know you
A	at the end of it all there are some really decent people out there who have
B	oh yeah
A	done lots and lots of good and then there are various like
B	and it's good when they do them on the telly when they do these things about people
A	yeah
B	and they give them all awards and they're people you don't know
A	oh yes
B	like headmistresses send a school around and
A	yeah that's lovely
B	and people I think the ones that that deal with all the disabled ones are the ones that need
A	definitely well they they just well it's about them putting in time or
B	well
A	really really well and they're very very committed and that they take it seriously and go
B	well they do don't they? they seem to do they seem to do those sort of people
A	yeah
C	just realised your chair's still in the bathroom when we moved it in at Christmas
