A	it'll be an extra seven thousand a year
B	will it?
C	ah

B	did they?
A	mm don't know who got it but somebody in the department went for it er
B	you didn't?

A	every
A	and if they haven't they're trying to get one
C	oh gosh
B	yeah
C	oh
B	oh dear
C	so what is special need cases like then?
B	well they?
C	really
A	they can be
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	the whole spectrum
C	that's hard isn't it?
A	ADHD er DDD or whatever that is I made that one up
A	erm
A	oh right
B	that was DDT
A	DDT that was wasn't it?
A	that's what they need you know I think that's what part of the problem
B	yeah
A	they are ah they are just at the moment they're just off the wall
B	that's weird innit? why is that? what are they being fed on?
A	I just dunno they're just off the wall this afternoon there was an exam and the exam started at one thirty and it was for an hour I think the I think it was for an hour and a half yeah it was for an hour and a half so one thirty-two thirty not only a hour maybe it was only a hour which meant that they would be ready for their last lesson
B	yeah
A	thirty of them this is year eleven decided that they weren't going to go to their last lesson they got out the building
B	out of the building?
C	yeah
A	they they left the building
B	why is that?
A	because they were being told they could
B	who on earth told them?
A	right so you've got one person you've got two people saying you're staying in school until the end of the day
B	yeah
A	even though you have an exam because you've still got lessons to go to and then you've got the new head who has kind of said oh if they're
B	oh
A	nobody nobody is telling one person or the other person what's what
B	oh that's a bit bad innit
A	right? and then of course the students that haven't got exams
B	they want to go home as well
A	they want to go home cos it's not fair
B	that's right
A	so with my group this afternoon I got laptops and I got I said right you can go on Bitesize this afternoon cos they've got their exam this time next week
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I said you can go on Bitesize and you will do some revision questions now I only had eight but pff two did it two did it no problem at all no real issues but the other six there was issues
B	was there?
A	one didn't do anything I'm not doing it it's not fair they've gone home I'm not doing it
C	mm
A	you've got an exam next week yeah and so what?
C	yeah
B	well we never used to be able to talk like that to teacher's did we?
C	no
A	you know I really didn't feel like actually recording it now would I the thing is if I recorded it and then played it back to the senior team would I then get into trouble?
B	yeah
A	cos cos it's the cos it's then
B	you're supposed to have permission anyway to record if they give you permission they'd be fine won't they? but then I don't know
A	it's like should I should I you know should I put a camera on me and show the abuse that you have to put up with from some students
C	mm
B	well there is a case for that
C	tempting
B	because in some er preschools and and not preschools nurseries they used to have the cameras on
C	they had to do that
B	so that the parents could see how they were behaving didn't they?
A	yeah
C	yeah cos there was a lot of trouble weren't they in some of these nurseries
B	cos there was a lot of trouble about it all in the nurseries
C	mm
B	and er you know it was all about abuse and stuff like that wasn't it and things so they had they had the cameras I don't know if they still do it
A	but but I know you know having been at that higher position I know if you're in a high position even our senior managers the kids don't have any respect for them as such they push it and push it and push it and walk away from them
B	do they?
A	so as a classroom teacher you've got no chance
B	no
A	because they don't see you being a head of school or a vice principal or anything like that they don't see it as the
C	mm
B	what an attitude
C	yeah
B	it's a terrible attitude
C	how do you deal with it really?
B	do they come to school
A	yeah yeah
B	so what happened to the other school the middle school or whatever you call it?
A	same type of thing
B	so how do they?
A	it depends it depends on which middle school they came from
C	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah but then what happens is you get the kids who see them getting away with it
B	well of course you do you get that all the time don't you? but
C	the other side mm
B	but you you get decent kids that think oh dear I'm not having anything to do with them you know I'll keep out the way sometimes they get bullied don't they?
A	yeah I I've my product design groups are year nines apart from one student who just will not do anything
B	yeah?
A	he'll be negative towards me so I'm feeling
B	picked upon
A	picked on
B	yeah
C	you'd be so bored wouldn't you if they're not gonna join in and I don't understand that
A	I don't need it so I'm not going to do it but you're not following the rules you're not doing this you're not doing the other you haven't given me forewarning marks now I don't need to give you forewarning marks because I spoke to my head of department because you're not working that I'm going to move you to an area where you can work yeah but that's creating that's that's putting me down that is isn't it? so I'm I'm feeling I'm getting negative vibes about it so I'm not going to do anything
A	and all I want to do really is just laugh
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's their life innit?
B	that's that's the really weird thing you see it's it's the respect has gone now hasn't it? the respect for anybody in authority is gone you know in in that
A	yeah ah it we don't we don't have any sanctions
B	no well you can't touch them for a start can you?
A	no you can't do anything like that but we have no it's I've got a lad who shouldn't be at the school alright? he is really severe erm

A	or eye
B	or eye pupil eyes pupils pupils
C	no no
A	or ear pattern
B	no
A	cos ear pattern is another one they can do I saw something on the on Twitter 3D printing of the ear canal so if people have got a bad ear now and they need to replace the ear canal they can 3D print it and put it in
B	wow
C	oh
B	that's pretty brilliant innit?
A	yeah
C	mm mm
B	that is pretty brilliant well they can do lots of 3D printing now can't they?
C	it's going to change a lot of things innit?
B	well there's these really good 3D printers they are fantastic they printed a plastic gun didn't they?
A	yeah but that's
C	mm
A	they it failed
B	it shot a bullet
A	yeah but it failed exploded
B	yeah but they could I mean they they've just said they they printed it

A	yeah cos they were
B	the spring yeah
A	although using the right material you can get away with it
B	well you could yeah yeah
A	but you can 3D print almost anything now
B	you can yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	cos that's all it is
B	yeah that that's all it is yeah
C	mm

A	a lot of gold jewellery
B	yeah
C	is it?
A	so where you used to have to cut with a piercing saw and do all the shaping and whatever

A	I'd love to live in that water tower I really would love to live in that water tower they paid two hundred and eight thousand pound for it
C	mm
A	and then they spent another two hundred thousand doing it up
B	I know but look how much it's worth now
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	that view they have from the top of it
B	well there's there's one at er where is it? Easton you could buy that

C	and it was an er accommodation as well wasn't it?
A	yeah that was at the
C	ideal
A	the
B	is it?
C	mm
A	yep I'm I just I don't know
B	you'll have to buy one
A	I wish
A	well to the
C	what was it we saw homes
B	I don't remember
C	it was thirty-nine thousand I think
B	where was it?
C	and opposite I don't know whereabouts it was was it the Peak district or something? opposite was just fields and woodland and
B	oh yeah
C	you know
B	beautiful
C	it was only a a semi or something but they did it up beautifully and
B	they did didn't they? it had a huge garden
C	yeah and you think what the location was absolutely amazing
A	yeah I'm sure I'm you know I'm sure that I'll get be able to do something
C	mm yeah
A	but you know you just er if I could just pick up things and just move them there so it was same
C	yeah cos up north there's there's some decent properties isn't there? for
B	yeah
A	for certain prices you get some good
C	good prices
B	well you can go and rent out a
C	especially if you get it at auction
B	our friend's house at
C	it always has been a rent option
B	yeah but they're renting it out under another
A	I would you know I'd well that's what I'm going to have to do to begin with rent somewhere isn't it? so
B	yeah
A	unless things change so
C	mm
A	unless things change that's what I'm going to have to do
B	well now let's hope you have more luck on your next viewing
C	mm there's got to be someone somewhere
A	I just think if I paint everywhere I really do think if I paint all the woodwork
B	and made it look a bit smarter you mean?
A	yeah just paint all the white woodwork
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	get rid of the get rid of the wallpaper just have a plain wall in the dining room
C	right
A	rather than a wallpaper just paint over it
C	mm
A	the problem I've got then is if I start painting the wallpaper it starts coming off
C	yeah
B	that's a problem innit yeah
C	that is a problem and then if you're in the middle of it and then you get a viewing that's another problem isn't it?
A	yeah
B	trouble is when when wallpaper's painted people think ah couldn't he take the wallpaper off? well the plaster come off when you take wallpaper off
A	yeah it's all those things
C	they're a problem sometimes aren't they? yeah
A	it's like using lining paper and stuff like that
B	mm
C	yeah
A	no I don't know
C	I mean we're doing the
B	yeah
C	but the amount of little holes everywhere and
B	cracks there's cracks you can get your fists in
C	cracks to fill in yeah there were cracks to begin with and then er oh it's just so many little bits
A	yes
C	it's amazing it never
B	no
C	and the ceiling is bad
B	ceiling is terrible
C	I'm not doing that though
B	that needs scraping all out plastering over
C	lots to do
B	and then putting a skim over the whole lot
A	well can't you
B	well you could do yeah but we it's got the cracks have got to be mended first because they're too far apart
A	right
B	to put skim
C	you taped some of it actually
B	we did tape some of it
C	on a notice yeah mm
B	it should have been taped in the first place this side
A	all the all the things should be taped all the joints should be taped
B	yeah yeah it should have been taped he taped them from the top
C	see because it was just a dairy we think he he did it really roughly we weren't down here then that was the first building
B	he just
A	yeah
C	that we put on here and he didn't do a very good job
A	he did a lousy job
C	basically because it was just a dairy
B	he didn't give two monkeys
C	not
A	yeah
B	he only did nine nine-inch footings
C	mm and we we've put the floor down since and that it's just concrete one the floor wasn't it?
B	well most building around here are nine-inch footings
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	they need to be they got to be a metre now footings
B	yep
A	in
B	in clay yeah
A	round here cos it just moves
C	yeah he used an old door for the loft patch
B	he really made a bodge he really bodged up didn't he?
C	yeah
B	he he got it done as quick as he could cos he knew that what he charged was too much money and we were getting a grant from the government to to build a a an agricultural place
A	yeah
B	you you got grants in and we got three thousand pound grant to build that and he charged us twelve thousand anyway didn't he?
C	yeah
B	and we had to pay him so much so much every
A	yeah
B	every move he made and we just paid up we didn't even inspect it did we?
C	no we just thought
B	we weren't down here
C	he was the only builder we knew basically
B	because he was he's a a local builder
C	he's er the son of the person who lived next door to us
B	yeah
C	or next door but one
B	yeah
C	wasn't he? we just thought oh we don't know any other builders
A	yeah
C	you know how you do you get someone you know don't you thinking
B	and we shouldn't have done but then
C	then we let him use his scaffold the field leave his scaffolding poles and that
B	yeah
C	thinking you know
A	yeah
B	he wanted a yard
C	yeah
B	so he left all his all his scaffolding
C	didn't do us any favours
B	gear up here
C	but there you are it was just a dairy that's all he thought about we had like a
B	it's kick off
A	kick off work time
A	work time
C	okay
A	work time
C	anyway hopefully that'll look nice when it's done up a bit
B	well it will when it's done won't it?
C	yeah taken longer than we thought though
A	yeah er
C	then I'm out in the garden
B	well she's up at five
A	thirty minutes
B	every day?
A	four thirty
B	are you? yeah
C	it's always four thirty?
A	four thirty
C	do you know why? just a natural thing
A	I had some strange dreams last night
C	oh
A	real strange dreams
A	I dreamt somebody phoned me up and says erm
B	oh dear
A	er
C	mm
A	I dreamt about the house
C	well it is a bit worrying that is innit? the house
A	I dreamt about I dreamt about school I dreamt about things that I hadn't done or thought I'd done or hadn't
C	yeah
A	but yeah I'm going to sleep easy I'm going to sleep when I get into bed in the sense that I went to bed at ten o'clock last night and I didn't have any distractions cos I didn't have my Ipad I didn't have anything and I turned the light out and then I fell asleep but then I woke up at half past four so I fell asleep round about eleven o'clock quarter past eleven then woke up at half past four
C	ah
B	well Maggie Thatcher only got sort of four-hours' sleep and she worked all day and all night so
A	and then I just and then you then you lie there and you think
C	mm
B	yeah you mustn't lay there thinking you got to get up and do things you mustn't lay there thinking soon as you wake up out of bed now then never mind about
A	but I don't want to get out of bed and I don't want to get out of bed but I know I have to and then I wake up and I'm quite nervous
B	nervous?
C	really?
A	mm I know that sounds yeah you know that nervy feeling you have
B	I know what you mean
C	mm
A	like apprehension or something like that so yeah
C	mm
B	there's only one cure for it that's the sale of your house to go through
A	the the the well there's two in there's two really
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and be in a place that I want to be no I I I'd you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get to Yorkshire I don't think or the Lakes or anything like that but I need to be able to get there on a regular basis
B	yeah when you want to go
A	when when I want to go you know?
C	mm
A	you know and it's got to be done in a way that is you know if I can you know if I could find a little spot or something a small caravan park or something like that maybe you know like a
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	with not loads of caravans on maybe and get so you can go up like six for a few weeks if I I've got a small house I haven't got to worry about that have I?
B	no no
A	then just stay up there
