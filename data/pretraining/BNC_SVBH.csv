A	there's fruit in this?
B	yeah in the jam
A	fruit in the jam in the juice in anything really
B	yoghurts
A	yes
B	I don't like the yoghurts with bits in
A	with bits in
B	yeah it's
A	you're meant to eat fruit
B	fruit
A	oh dear
B	no
A	well clearly not
B	no no no no no
A	and how are you?
B	I'm exhausted
A	are you?
B	ah I've just had the supplier coming around to
A	mm mm
B	and my brain aches
A	oh dear
B	I woke up with like a sick feeling butterflies
A	oh no
B	yeah I've been really dreading it because I had to lead the meeting
A	oh
B	yeah
A	my daughter the manager
B	mm hardly but
A	you're so capable and
B	I'm not I want to cry
A	oh I think this is excellent
B	it's horrible
B	mm
A	mm
B	and we're replacing the typesetter the typesetting work with Indian suppliers
A	oh excellent
B	yup because they're five pounds a page rather than twenty-five pounds a page which UK suppliers are
A	mm
B	but they're rubbish so it's a completely
A	well yes
B	false economy
B	erm so we're looking at ways of making it a bit easier for them looking at ways looking at how they've really let us down and
A	mm
B	because it was the first time we've used this project management company and the guy the MD used to work in-house
A	right
B	A really nice guy
A	mm
B	he used to work in like our academic division so he knows
A	mm mm
B	and another one of the erm one of my er colleagues who is on maternity leave at the moment
A	mm
B	for us to say like we're all a bit concerned about these issues
A	oh dear
B	any concerns
A	oh
B	which is not what you want really because they've got all your files all your formats all your covers
A	yeah
B	all your body files
A	has erm yeah yeah I mean that is obviously what you're supposed to do
B	obviously you want to build relationships with people because then you understand each other you know each other you rely on each other and they understand your product
A	mm
B	but you know we have  we have  about four or five different suppliers in the UK
A	mm
B	we have about three or four Indian suppliers that we're starting to place work with
A	are they improving though?
B	mm
A	not really? No
B	one of them is rubbish
B	well luckily they don't erm control that
A	alright
B	I mean they literally do the design
A	right
B	erm and the products that we have and working on should in theory be extremely straightforward because they've practise tests in Cambridge ESOL
A	oh I see
B	supply us with the exams
A	mm
B	we copy edit it erm we'll put our copyright line in
A	no
B	set of proofs to another and so you've got half of one exam and half of another
A	but that's really bad
B	bog standard stuff
A	yeah
B	particularly because we're we're we're moving into a digital age where if we supply a Word document it's already styled so that they can flow it straight into their template in their design template
A	mm
B	they're not doing that even though it's that would be the easiest thing to do
A	no I'm I am listening
B	what are you doing? You're not listening you're playing
A	I am
B	put the TV on then
A	I am listening
B	er anyway so yeah so they came in and we had a chat
A	mm
B	end of story
A	mm
B	and gradually everyone had to go to another meeting so there was just me and Joe
A	mm
B	cos it was a I think he's taken stuff away and we've taken stuff away so
A	Good
B	it was good
A	are you going to be doing more with these now? Is this this is gonna be part of your life now doing meetings like this
B	yeah
A	oh you don't hate it it's just  it's just
B	I do hate it it makes me feel sick
A	it makes you a bit nervous that's all but
B	that's why
A	yes
B	all that horrendous stuff
A	life now
B	I hate it
A	oh
B	but while those courses are available and they're not free
A	yeah
B	but you know they could be
A	yeah
B	the department pays
A	exactly
B	but you might as well
A	just think of erm
B	mm mm
A	and she has to give that presentation and she has the circle
A	and
B	did she say what are we doing?
A	yes
B	mm
A	and and they all applauded yeah
B	and she asked everybody what are  what are  we doing here?
A	yeah
B	what what is this job? And no no one tells her no one can answer her
A	but it's all just  it's all just  words and they don't mean anything and the idea is they don't mean anything and erm names for things that don't mean anything is actually all of it is just meaningless
B	erm and they just business-speak is so stupid the
A	yeah
B	the things that they say like I was in a meeting with erm it was when I was being a PA for Geoff and I was taking minutes and he was talking about something or other and he said we'll take this offline
A	mm
B	why not just say that?
A	I know
B	or or going forward or what
A	mm
B	you know?
A	it's all just jargon and
B	all management-speak it's just
A	business-speak and
B	you just sound like an idiot
A	it's it's all horrible
B	mm
A	I suppose you do
B	and maybe it just happens one night you just wake up and you speak like an idiot
B	that's what I'm worried about
A	I think  I think  it's if you're in that environment you just it's you just become like that
B	yeah
A	and you start speaking like them
B	yeah
A	so watch it
B	well I already told you that I felt sick the the other week when I had to erm knock down one of our UK suppliers
A	mm
B	on their price
A	mm
B	and I
A	mm mm
B	and they are
A	but they they're obviously struggling now
B	offshore
A	mm
B	and you're not  you're not  cutting off
A	it's horrible isn't it?
B	their hands but it just makes you feel sick
A	yeah
B	and you think well that's
A	it is horrible mm
B	I mean it's not  it's not  erm it's not it wouldn't be a problem to pay thirty pounds a page because that's what you would expect to pay
A	mm
B	but we did say to them when we went to meet them that erm you know we are being asked to
A	yeah
B	offshore where possible
A	yeah
B	erm and if and our argument is it's a false economy because
A	mm
B	the amount of time we've spent in man hours liaising with them and answering the most basic of queries and sending stuff back when it's wrong
A	mm
B	you know to pay a production controller's salary you might as well freelance it out to a get
A	mm
B	UK supplier and get it right first time someone who knows you
A	well yes
B	it's just
A	sometimes it is just a false economy
B	mm
A	mm
B	if they wanted to keep the work and it's probably what they're gonna have to do
A	it's very hard though cos you know small companies er will really struggle in this kind of climate
B	and really at this time you want to be placing work
A	mm
B	with suppliers you trust and
A	you would think so but it
B	suppliers in the UK
B	mm
A	their own profits are the only things that erm
B	yeah
A	really matter
B	and we're not
A	so
B	we're not  making any money
A	no
B	we're really not
A	and that's what that's what'll happen
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm it's a problem
A	mm
B	Oscar
A	he looks even funnier from the other side
A	he looks hilarious
B	half a head
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yes and I mean it's not raining at the moment so maybe he's just being cautious because he thinks it will any minute now
B	because he got very wet today
A	he always gets wet
B	your bedroom doors are open though
A	yes
B	it's been raining for about three weeks
A	I know
B	mm
A	it's just so difficult to keep him out you know I don't it's a small flat and he's my cat erm I don't like chasing him out of places
B	mm
A	but I do get fed up with paw prints everywhere
B	like here
A	oh yeah and all up and down here
B	tend to wipe his feet when he comes in
A	yeah I would do
B	the paws
A	he's also moulting so there's fur everywhere I've just hoovered
B	mm
A	anyway
B	so how has your day been?
A	quiet
B	oh that sounds nice
A	yes
B	you've had quite a busy week from the sounds of it?
A	I know
B	mm
A	not onerous it's not erm
B	mm
A	that erm he'd like me to be involved with and it sounds really good and it shouldn't be too much
B	mm
A	none of it is just turn up do it and go home
B	yeah
A	erm she was quite down
B	mm
A	erm I think two years ago maybe less erm so it's quite new
B	right
A	so you just take tablets but there are quite a few side-effects and she's obviously worried that the side-effects are going to be something she can't cope with
B	really? Will it make her lose her hair?
A	no I mean it the thing that will bother her most I think is erm is nausea and sickness
B	mm
A	it also can affect your blood pressure your iron levels your thyroid levels
B	blimey
A	but they do
B	wasn't it all the nausea?
A	absolutely
B	mm mm
A	I just  I just  think it's so bad
B	mm
A	anyway
B	yeah absolutely
A	so I think she's worried about that
B	last options
A	yeah
B	oh God
A	so you know you can
B	yeah
A	so long as it agrees with you and so long as it works
B	yeah
A	but it is effective for this kind of cancer so
A	yeah
B	well that's good news cos this
A	so they've got everything crossed and I suppose Alex is running around like a crazy person following up
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	sometimes he's just incredibly busy speaking to er
B	right
A	and and the thing is that they're brilliant they say oh yeah yeah what do you want to know about it? Yeah
B	really?
A	it's fantastic
B	mm
A	and such a good way about him and they're they seem very happy and and keen to talk about it and to discuss what they've done and you know possibilities and
B	mm
A	you know? So that's what he's done he goes straight to the top
B	fabulous
A	it seems like a very good  a very good  way of doing things
B	A good friend to have
A	yeah
B	mm
A	whether anything will come from the
B	you'll just
A	hopefully one day I mean it does sound incredibly promising
B	mm
A	but erm I don't know
B	you've just got to keep at it
A	mm
B	well no one's gonna listen to it
A	okay
B	Oscar
A	you should remind me not to say names
B	they anonymise it
A	okay
B	I told you that didn't I?
A	no
B	they anonymise it yeah
A	okay
A	okay
B	mm
A	yeah me too and the wind it's very windy today
B	have you spoken to
A	I haven't erm I meant to phone him this afternoon and I haven't got around to it
B	are you going to see him at the weekend?
A	is it Thursday?
B	it's Thursday yeah
A	it is isn't it? Erm I'm hoping he'll come over erm but he hasn't said
B	mm
A	erm and you're going to dad's this afternoon so you'll see him there won't you?
B	I'll see him there yeah
A	yeah?
B	they've screwed up his benefits I think
A	really?
B	he sent me a message last night but I just didn't really read it properly I just said it's fine
A	no okay so long as he's not spinning you a line
B	well I'm gonna go around there tonight and just speak to him about it in front of dad
A	what and and dad  and dad  would know cos obviously he has to go with him
B	exactly
A	so that's  so that's  good
B	well he's been filling all his paperwork in to say
A	we still  we still  haven't  we still haven't  you know agreed all of this so
B	yeah
A	we need to do this
B	is this your letter?
A	yes do you want to read it?
B	do you want me to?
A	of course
B	do you mind?
A	of course
B	oh my God
B	oh lovely names
B	causes me some query
A	yeah
B	some query?
A	he's not sure if it's a boy's name or girl's name
B	yeah
A	about who you were when you were born and what you do erm but he's obviously forgotten
B	nice that he's written by hand
A	it is and it's  and it's  from him
B	yeah exactly
A	well I mean he says it's from both of them but you know what I mean
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean why can't he come here firstly? I strongly suggest you travel business class
A	I know
B	well I've just got to get my spare three grand out of my savings
B	and to use British Airways we have found them the best
A	well they've travelled a lot in their lives and they have been back to the UK erm a few times I'm sure
B	mm
A	but they've travelled a lot
B	hope to see you this year
A	cruise
B	I don't know the cost
A	I know
B	the two but two of you would be ideal for but is that better? Four berth
A	berth
B	a four-berth cabin with bathroom toilet and shower and friendly Friday?
A	what's the next word?
B	end of the sentence
A	friendly I think it says yeah
B	we have done some great cruises our first being on Love Boat
A	broke her ankle
B	her ankle and a short time ago plus elbow
A	mm
B	very sad for a trained ballet dancer
A	well I think he he obviously had more to say
B	yeah
A	you know just just carried on
B	I I say business class perhaps if you come on your own and if the boys could help financially
A	I know but
B	and B why would it only be boys who could support you financially?
A	I know
B	no
A	well you've got to  you've got to  think of it as age
B	luggage comfortable seats et cetera
A	you've got to think of his age and you know he is thinking
A	yeah
A	I mean she hates her name as it is and it's
B	was she out?
A	no she was  she was  at home and I was on my way and I'd just  I'd just  left
B	mm
A	and I noticed I'd had a text from her and she said I'm watching Pointless and there are two sisters on there called
A	and I I texted back Well I think that's really nice
B	what on earth is Pointless? Ah the TV show
A	yeah
A	I mean that is a bit much perhaps for the two of them but
B	mm
A	it's nice to have
B	they sound like witches
A	a name that stands out you know? I don't know
B	it's nice to have a name that's quite different
A	I mean
B	not that it is anymore
A	so your name we wanted something traditional and we thought it would be unusual in those days
B	not that it was
A	to have you know everyone was called
A	you know
B	yeah
A	which we we didn't we hadn't banked on that at all
B	yeah good work
A	well you don't know these things do you? I mean I'm
B	no obviously not
A	well there you go
B	I really like the name
A	yeah
B	mm I like that as well
A	because it also means star
B	that's what I mean yeah
A	no it's it's with an A
B	no
A	I know
B	and he's been the one to write it himself though
A	I think it's interesting
B	mm
A	and I think he's had some space to actually you know go off on his own
B	mm
A	and write the letter
B	mm
A	and I think she probably is very domineering
B	mm
A	and not that he
B	yeah
A	but
B	it doesn't leave much room for anybody else
A	no
B	mm
A	erm no he has he had a a daughter
B	mm
A	it's around that
B	mm
A	that sort of time
B	oh and there was
A	that it was from the both of them
B	both but it was her and not him
A	but it was you know she said oh
B	mm
A	I mean he might well have done he might have
B	mm
A	but anyway erm I mean she knew about me but
B	mm
A	anyway
B	mm
A	erm she didn't get on with her and erm I think her name is Samantha
B	oh I didn't know this
A	she said oh it's very sad and it's very you know all the rest of it
B	mm
A	erm and I was quite shocked that you know that he would be okay with that but
B	mm
A	maybe he's one of these men anything for a quiet life
B	mm
A	I get the feeling he probably is
B	mm
A	erm so she wouldn't er she wouldn't say anything about her
B	mm
A	but would he be okay could he give me her you know an address or or something so that I could contact her? Would he be okay with that? You know I don't  I don't  I'm not gonna force the issue with them
B	mm
A	but would he mind if I did because I would like to contact my sister
B	mm
A	I mean I suppose if I did have the money I could have gone out there and and it might have been awkward
B	very exciting
A	which is nice
B	it's really good
A	I was very touched
B	yeah of course
A	I was quite emotional about that
B	yeah
A	very emotional about it so
B	yeah it's a really nice way to open the letter
A	it is
B	well I mean how old is he
A	it's it's really nice
B	anyway?
A	he's eighty-one
B	well there you go
A	yeah
B	he probably is a bit bananas
B	he lives out in Australia
A	yeah
B	it is in Queensland and they're all
A	yeah well maybe
B	well only if you think that that's okay
A	have a  have a  weekend
B	mm
A	erm and you know you should do that
B	mm
A	because I can't imagine how much the flight might be?
B	it depends when you want to go
A	well I'd go when it wasn't hot so
B	yeah exactly
A	mm
B	like if you were if it was the north
A	mm
B	then it would always be hot because it's the tropics
A	really?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know to come out and go on a day when you know if you think like mid-week and it's not going to be very busy and they're gonna have empty seats on the plane
A	but you'd have to be prepared to go there every day you know on the off-chance of
B	on the off-chance
A	of getting
B	yeah
A	I mean that's that's quite a risk
B	it is quite a risk
A	yeah
B	only got two weeks and you need to guarantee you've got a holiday
A	yes
B	I still don't know
A	nearer the time?
B	erm I mean they do often do deals
A	mm
B	I mean I'm gonna try and keep an eye out for British Airways
A	mm
B	on a holiday there and I was so jealous
A	mm
B	british Airways I don't think fly to Cuba but he said yeah yeah it's British Airways
A	I didn't think you could go straight there isn't that what you found?
B	no you can't go from America
B	oh from oh okay
B	you can go from here but it's Virgin
A	right
B	which is who I flew with erm or like a tin can
A	right
B	but you don't want to be doing that
A	no
B	it turned out British Airways put their name erm to other airlines and you think you're flying with British Airways but you're not
A	no
B	so Steve ended up flying with some bucket shop erm tin can
A	surely that's illegal?
B	which must be illegal so he's following it up with the airline because there's no way they would have gone
A	how can they do that?
B	little tin can
A	that's so unethical
B	so one screen for the whole cabin it's really bad
A	that's outrageous
B	because they're saying you're getting your British Airways flight and you're not
A	that is outrageous
B	so he's gonna follow up with that because that's just absolutely shocking
A	he'll write to er Anne bloody Robinson
B	yeah she'll take it up she loves a good cause
A	mm
B	wondering if you flew in the middle of the year
A	you did you thought erm you knew you'd paid quite a lot because you went out on Boxing Day didn't you?
B	mm
A	oh my God
B	that was like budget
A	that's just
B	mm
A	my God
B	but if you went during the year but yeah it probably would be about a thousand pounds by the time you
A	mm
B	and spending money
A	oh God
B	so yeah I mean maybe in the letter you would write back and say yeah I'll I'll certainly be saving some money so I'm not quite sure when blah blah
A	mm
B	erm oh are they coming to the UK any time soon? And then
A	I think she would say if he was I think they're probably not
B	mm
A	I mean he's got
B	as he did when he was twenty
A	I think it's you see I think she immediately thought
B	you were after his money
A	I was after an inheritance which is ridiculous
B	yeah
A	but she immediately thought that because she made several comments
B	directly yeah
A	but you know obliquely
B	yeah
A	erm erm and I think he that that might be a way of him saying you know I couldn't help you you know?
B	mm
A	could you know because otherwise he he might have suggested but now anyway
B	mm
A	so yeah erm I don't think he realises how tough you know economically it is living here so
B	mm
A	excuse me
B	mm
A	his his brother er died I think  I think  I'm sure he said he died well quite a while ago in the early two thousands I think
B	mm
A	erm I can't remember exactly
B	mm
A	but now no
B	yeah there's no reason to come all this way
A	no exactly so
B	mm
A	I think he liked it
B	mm
A	and I'm pretty sure that's what he was referring to you know he the bands on these big cruises I think he used to do that for a while
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	well I mean in terms of land you get a lot more for your money
A	mm
B	you know if if he does
A	well it looks like they've got quite a nice big place
B	right
A	you know it's it's er it's a very posh kind of area
B	oh right okay
A	yeah
B	I mean Australia is expensive but it
A	I looked  I looked  at it on the erm on Google Maps I looked it up
B	mm
A	well it's it's the Gold Coast so it
B	yeah
A	it is an expensive area yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's a nice nice area
A	mm
B	A nice area to live
A	so you know they've done quite well for themselves I think
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so does she have kids?
A	erm didn't I tell you? She had a daughter and er she was murdered
B	yeah you probably did tell me that I don't know why that didn't stick in my mind
A	yeah
B	God
A	I think she was her only child and she was incredibly close to her
B	mm
A	you know that she was so
B	oh erm
A	what's her
B	oh
B	mm
A	and I think there was just no space for anyone else
B	mm
A	and she became jealous of her and the way that you know
B	overprotective?
A	yeah and and had no time for erm Lauren
B	mm
A	it made life very difficult for her and I think it would have been a similar situation I
B	yeah
A	that's what I'm reading into it
B	yeah
A	that it seems likely that that's what happened
B	bloody hell
A	there was a big trial and everything yeah
B	well no
A	and it really is a terrible thing to happen of course it is
B	I don't think you ever could could you?
A	no
B	bloody hell
A	yeah
B	right so there's just the two of them then?
A	mm
B	and does
A	yes but I don't know where and it's a big place
B	mm
A	erm so I don't know
B	yeah
A	well it would be nice but anyway
B	baby steps
A	yes
B	this is really encouraging it's really positive
A	it is isn't it?
B	it's nice to think
A	it is
B	that that's not going to be your lasting memory of them
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	mm
A	mm
B	personally
A	but maybe it was a shock to the system at the time
B	yeah
A	and they've both kind of forgotten about it erm but obviously I think it's been kind of
B	yeah it's been in the background
A	yeah in the back of his mind and and suddenly he's had a little bit of space to do it and he's actually sat down and done it
B	he's probably wanted to for a while
A	I think may be mm
B	you know he wasn't sure what reaction she would have if she was a bit
A	mm
B	a bit unsure about the whole thing
A	I think he's just used to letting her make decisions and you know that was that really
B	well yeah it sounds like it's like that
A	I think some men just were like that you know whatever the woman said went
B	yeah
A	I mean erm
B	mm
A	they make you know they do all the domestic stuff I go to work
B	yeah
A	and it saves them from having to think about it
B	the precious dears
A	mm
B	and I'd found online a seller who deals in vintage Ladybird books
A	mm mm
B	and you know sort of collectable
A	mm mm
B	books erm and there was one called The Sailor which obviously as the name suggests is about the Navy
A	mm
B	and obviously it's got a picture of a male sailor on the front
A	mm
B	and he's
A	mm mm
B	they are  they are  worth something and it's you know it is er it is appropriate
A	then you think yeah
B	the time you think oh I don't know is it?
A	yes exactly
B	but she really did like it
A	Good
B	but it's very I think it's from nineteen fifty-seven
A	yeah
B	so it's obviously very much of its time
A	wow that's that's an early one
B	yeah really early erm so
A	God
B	yeah it's just really hilarious
A	mm that's right
B	which is
A	I remember those yeah
B	obviously a a female nurse
A	yeah
B	A schoolteacher
A	right
B	yeah
A	how funny
B	absolutely hilarious
A	why not?
B	eight hours sleep
A	mm
B	just not feasible really
A	oh well you're gonna have to do it
B	well yeah I mean I might turn in but you know it's sort of pottering around and
A	mm
B	and when I've done a few emails or watch a bit of TV and I have to yeah
A	no no no
B	I'll have to be a bit strict I'm tired
A	yeah you you just have to learn to switch off and er
B	mm
A	try and get your sleep
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	I know
A	so what are you doing this weekend?
B	erm drinks after work tomorrow but not a late one
A	mm
B	and then it's
A	mm mm
B	so I thought I might make a cake Saturday and then get ready and she wants to go for cocktails but luckily because she works at the hotel we can get half price cocktails
A	oh good
B	I'll probably go there and then I might try and persuade her by
A	God I think that would be awful on a Saturday night
B	absolutely horrendous and it's all just gonna be
A	yeah
B	so she's not gonna want to go I mean she's younger than me she's twenty-five but still
A	mm
B	erm I've been trying to persuade her
A	yeah quite
B	with not going there
A	which is such a cheat honestly
B	such a rip-off
A	oh dear
B	mm
A	oh dear
B	yup and then sleep Sunday
A	fair enough
B	I think
A	that's what I need to do
B	my dates?
A	mm mm
B	okay so the first date
A	yeah
B	well this weekend I'm around but not really
A	mm
B	erm
A	on the Sunday mm
B	obviously then it's the bank holiday which is nice so
A	oh right
B	I'm off on the Monday
A	okay so we might see you on the Monday?
B	er possibly yeah
A	okay
B	and the following weekend I'm where? I was gonna be going to
A	right
B	so I'm around on the Thursday night if
A	mm mm
B	here on the Sunday
A	so is that the twenty-sixth then?
B	well what's the Saturday then? Yeah the twenty-sixth yeah
A	okay
B	back on the twenty-sixth from London
A	so what's that?
B	that's the fourth of June is it? Is that the Monday? So there's so the Saturday is the second of June
A	alright
B	and then I'm off all of that week
A	and then you're back?
B	I'm back I don't know Sunday Monday I'm not sure
A	oh okay
B	I'm off all that week
A	fair enough
B	Sunday Monday and Tuesday so
A	yeah
B	erm and then I'm around the rest of the week
A	mm mm and when's
B	eighteenth
A	the eighteenth
B	and
A	and is that?
B	that's
A	that's
B	yeah
A	right
B	so
A	so and you're going for a week then?
B	er no I'm going Wednesday to probably Saturday
A	okay
B	and that's it
A	okay that's well that's quite a lot
B	that's quite a lot yeah
A	bl-imey
B	I know that's why I had to say no to all the hen parties
A	wow
B	so you just can't I mean
A	no
A	yeah it would have been fun but anyway
B	it would have been really fun yeah
A	exactly
B	like I saw
A	yeah
B	but she doesn't have that so she's
A	right okay
B	but the thing is then she won't have any money
A	well she's
B	so her dad said I can lend you some money but he he's not flush by any means so
A	no I mean it's it's hard for
B	you can't and you can't rely on your parents to do that
A	no
B	it's not really very fair that they fund your trip
A	I mean if they're wealthy then that's another matter but most you know ordinary people are
B	no
A	yeah pretty much
B	so and plus it's her
A	mm
B	she has to pay for it
A	she's gonna have to work for another year and save up the same as you
B	well she's paid for her flight she's off she doesn't have a job
A	well what
B	because her flight's now is June
A	I mean what happens if you go there on on holiday and stay there?
B	they'll kick you out
A	mm
B	I mean you can't use any kind of
A	mm
B	so you have to apply for a working visa which she's been granted
A	mm
B	erm which is why you need to have the five thousand dollars
A	but if she doesn't hasn't got the money there then
B	they won't let you in
A	she's
B	yeah they'll just send you back which is in absolute waste
A	and what's she gonna do?
B	well she says to start work straightaway I mean she wanted to go all around
A	is she gonna  is she gonna  take a loan out or something?
B	well I don't know she's only just cleared herself of debt
A	well she can take a loan out so the money was there but how would she pay it back from there?
B	exactly
A	mm
B	she's just not gonna have any money when she's there
A	mm
B	because her mum at least will take her side of the share of the money back
A	yeah
B	erm it's gonna be fairly hard
A	mm
B	what is she really gonna be doing?
A	yeah quite
B	until the schools go back in September or whenever they start back
A	right
B	so she would erm the PGCE is recognised globally so
A	right so she shouldn't have much of a problem
B	she wouldn't
A	it's just I mean how many jobs are there for primary school teachers?
B	well this is it I mean certainly in the UK if you don't have a job by the spring the summer term
A	yeah
B	you won't have a job for September
A	Oscar in or out
B	so I don't know I mean she's booked the flight the return flight for February
A	mm
B	but you can  you can  change it
A	right
B	it's you pay a premium but you can change it
A	hello
B	but you need to be
A	well it gives her some time to to sort things
B	well it might mean that if she can't get a job and all she's got is the money that in her pocket which might only be a couple of thousand
A	mm
B	but it does mean
A	yeah it just depends how er
B	but if she's got a couple of grand
A	how expensive it is to live there
B	very expensive
A	well where where is she gonna stay?
B	she's gonna have to stay in hostels which is expensive and annoying you know you don't want to stay in a hostel when you're thirty
A	no
B	that's why people do it when they're you know eighteen or twenty-one
A	yeah and they don't  they don't  care
B	and rest
A	he does like it up there it's really funny
B	cat face
A	it's your favourite person over there
B	hiya
A	yeah
B	she said I saw her on Tuesday and we went to the cinema erm
A	yeah what did you go and see?
B	oh it was some stupid horror film it was pretty funny actually
A	oh dear
B	and erm but one girl was taking it very seriously and they were in the cabin and you know like just don't go upstairs
A	oh dear
B	I mean normally you don't like it when people talk through movies but she
A	oh yeah yeah
B	West Wing Kay was in it and he was so funny
B	ho-hum Dominoes have sent me a text message Domino's Pizza any size pizza seven ninety-nine
A	any size? Can we have one that's this big?
B	well yeah basically that's what I think that's what they're saying
A	oh that'll be alright
B	Pisa
A	erm what's oh he's working isn't he?
B	yup that's what I mean he's not gonna be home until half six
A	that might be nice actually rather than leave him on his own
B	mm
A	I haven't spoken to him so erm although I did tell dad and he was quite he was very pleased to hear it so er erm
B	you told dad?
A	yeah he phoned just to say oh that he'd he'd got a new fridge yesterday he was waiting for that and erm
B	he'd called just to tell you he'd got a new fridge?
A	well no there was that and also we need to fill some forms in and he'd found a phone number
B	what happened to the woman who came around and did the assessment?
A	well we haven't heard from her so
B	so that's who he's trying to call or just the fact
A	no this is about the other form so yeah
B	I'll have to get him to follow up with that woman
A	yes I mean he did phone her once I think
B	yeah he did yeah
A	yeah
B	so if that means that there is funding available for Richard for September
A	well exactly
B	I mean you need to get on that because
A	I know we do I know
B	you need to apply
A	I know
B	important
A	definitely yeah
A	oh dear
A	Don't you?
B	my Mac exploded or imploded
A	what?
B	yesterday it just went ah goodnight and just wouldn't start and wouldn't run programmes and
A	oh my God
B	yeah apparently it's quite new it's only it's less than a year old and it was just really unhappy so the IT
A	oh
B	yeah not mine
A	oh I thought you meant yours
B	no no at work
A	oh dear
B	sorry at work
A	Good
B	tomorrow
A	mm
B	but that's my breakfast sausage cup
A	no apparently not
B	sausage cup
A	oh dear never mind
B	and we move into our new office in
A	oh
B	next week I'm volunteering I'm using my seven hours to volunteer at
A	are you? Oh
B	for the charity shop erm tidying and selling and I don't really know
A	well good luck with that it's just an absolute jumble sale in there
B	I'm so excited
A	you do
B	I'm getting my Marigolds on
A	it won't look like that for long
B	Kim and Aggie style
A	I I doubt it
A	yeah right
B	actually have a sale there
A	oh that's nice though
B	so that's yeah that's where we're doing it
A	that would be cute
B	it would be  it would be  nice but they were doing it this week in the rain
A	yeah
B	on the
A	well I don't know you you'd quite like that wouldn't you?
B	I would if it wasn't persisting it down then yeah
A	yeah
B	but
A	oh well
B	yeah it's good that they do it and they give you the option to volunteer
A	yeah
B	a day a year so it's good
A	yeah
B	yup it is good
A	mm
B	and then they're moving us over the weekend
A	over the weekend yeah
B	so it's power down pack everything up next week
A	yeah
B	all the crap that you accumulate
A	so and where is it then?
B	it's the
A	really?
B	yup so over time what everyone's speculating is that they'll move us all over over there
A	yeah
B	and sell our building
A	yeah
B	building and sell it on to the property developers
A	selling things off?
B	selling things off
A	well what happens when they when they've er ran out of things to sell?
B	well I think that's when the redundancies come
A	so what what have they done to the printing er?
B	well this where we are now
A	I know they sold it off but but I mean
B	yeah they've sold the
A	they're not offices are they?
B	no they're it was a hangar
A	yeah
B	so they've brought in a company to put in a low ceiling and better flooring
A	yeah
B	and lights and all the rest of it
A	well why would
B	well there's er there's more  there's more  space to move everybody into that building rather than move everybody from there into ours and ours is older
A	oh I see okay
B	and so they've moved us all into that but I think ELT's grown erm at an unsustainable rate
A	mm
B	very quickly where we actually now er are no more than two hundred and then education they downsized and they had redundancies and they offshore all of their page makeup and all of their costs and they're turning a a really good budget now they're they're making quite a a healthy profit
A	oh
B	we won't meet budget this year which is really worrying
A	mm
B	it's mainly and mainly because we sell
A	mm
B	so our
A	right
B	didn't help the
A	mm
B	erm yeah I don't know what's gonna happen? I mean if if you have two hundred people
A	oh it's strange isn't it?
B	what we can actually manage to publish and that was the whole thing behind this new restructure in the ELT
A	yeah
B	even though I've been there two years and we've had three restructures
A	mm
B	but I don't know
A	oh dear
B	but we have a hell of a lot of work on at the moment just and that our digital capacity just isn't isn't there
A	mm
B	you know that we've had to put on hold two of our global learning courses so creating something that's completely online
A	mm mm
B	and no books
A	wow
B	which American institutions and
A	mm
B	they want to be completely paperless
A	mm
B	I don't know I think the Press is
A	well I suppose you've got to decide if that's definitely the way you you've got to go
B	well certainly that's if that's what the markets are telling you they want that's what you have to do you have to respond
A	yeah
B	so I don't know I mean it's in terms of what we have at the moment I don't think our jobs are in danger because we have too much work
A	mm
B	because there's money in the budget to do so and we need help
A	no
B	and it is really unfair because there's two people in this department who were hired
A	yeah I mean  I mean  you
B	but you can't ever go guarantee
A	it's  you know it's  only for
B	well yeah but not it doesn't seem to be at the
A	well I think that they've been lucky
B	that's not
A	in the past because that wouldn't normally happen
B	no
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	he was working in finance
A	yeah
B	no but I'd like to leave as a production controller and not a trainee
A	yeah
B	and I don't know how long it'll take
A	to get to that
B	to get there
A	okay
B	yeah but I mean I'm already worrying you know it's the end of April which I can't really believe
A	I know
B	I'm not quite sure how that happened
A	no I'm not
B	erm but we are
A	I wish it was a bit nicer I I really enjoy the light evenings now
B	yeah absolutely
A	but I mean the weather you just wouldn't think
B	yeah isn't it?
A	and you know including the weeds and and I can't get out there to do anything so
B	yeah we need it though
A	as soon as  as soon as  the rain stops we're gonna have to have a blitz out there
B	yeah
A	we did need it
B	that's fine
A	it has encouraged
B	mm
A	all kinds of growth everywhere
B	I can see the honeysuckle oh that looks nice
A	no it's
B	oh
A	erm er forsythia I think it's called
B	oh
A	I mean it's it's very cheerful erm and it's bright yellow in the spring yeah
B	I mean really we need to cut down the honeysuckle on the
A	we do
B	trellis
A	I know we do
B	sooner rather than later no matter what the weather
A	I know I'm just not going I'm not going out there in the pouring rain and pulling out plants
B	well no but I mean on a day like this I know it's it stop starts stop
A	yeah
B	starts because of the wind
A	it is yeah
B	but actually if you were to run out now and not that any of us are going to for an hour
A	yeah
B	and hack it down while it's cold and windy but actually not raining that's what we need to do
A	I'll see  I'll see  how how I feel on the next few
B	yeah it's been horrible all week
A	but it's but today has been better it's just incredibly windy
B	yeah
A	erm I mean it wouldn't be pleasant going out there in all this wind
B	yeah
A	but you can't cut it
B	no I know
A	Cos it's just too wet
B	mm
A	so we're gonna have to wait until it's all finished
B	mm
A	I mean I don't know I might have to risk it you know on a  on a  bright afternoon you know and cut it
B	well there's
A	yeah
B	but the rest of it we can
A	well we'll we'll have to
B	it's
A	yeah really hard to do
B	we need to do it the next week
A	yeah
B	because really
A	yeah I should do
B	it was horrible chopping it down last year
A	I know  I know  it was I know
B	but that's the only thing the rest of it we can dig it up as we
A	as we go yeah
B	a bit nicer
A	I should go out there and do that at least
B	well
A	I could have a go at it yeah
B	the next time I'm here if it's like this we can go out
A	yeah
B	and do it
A	even if I make a start yeah
A	I
B	okay
A	and
B	and you said you emailed
A	I did yes
B	about when he was next round?
A	mm
B	yeah cos now that you've put the idea in my head
A	I know
B	I just really
A	I know
B	I need to get out
A	I just need him to reply
B	yeah yeah
A	but it's annoying when he
B	yeah
A	you know some people are like that?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they just ignore you as if that's not gonna hurt your feelings
A	and I think no just say
B	yeah
A	I think it is
B	he's not addressing the problem
A	yeah
B	but that's fine I mean if you emailed him like a week ago and he hasn't replied then I think that's a bit of a tell-tale
A	no erm erm what's today?
B	Thursday
A	I think I did it on Tuesday
B	okay so he'll just be rushing around
A	ooh I don't know
B	you're hungry
A	it's rumbly
B	rumbly in your tumbly?
A	yes
B	gosh Gromit
A	and I don't know what to do for dinner
B	egg and chips?
A	oh I think we've only got one egg left
B	oh no
A	mm we had  we had  eggs the other day
B	yum in my tum
A	there's lots of stuff in the freezer cos I I got stuff in cos she wanted me to so
B	waffles?
A	yeah there's lots of waffles there's also erm you know like these vegetable burger things
B	mm
A	cos she likes those and they're very easy
B	yeah
A	and kind of vegetable fish fingers and things and I'm thinking really? Fish
B	right
A	so it's it's all a bit strange but anyway that's fine
B	mm mm
A	erm because I because she just doesn't cook
B	yum
A	so for whatever's in the freezer and that's that
B	pizza and scrambled eggs together
A	well no
B	yum
A	dear
B	there's a pizza with an egg in it isn't there?
A	is there?
B	florentine or something? Yeah they crack an egg in it
A	oh my God
B	florentine I think is the one with spinach
A	spinach yeah it's spinach and egg
B	there you go
A	that's what it is Florentine it's it's usually you know it's it's a bed of spinach that's been nicely cooked and flavoured and and you poach an egg on the top of it
B	oh well that's the name of the pizza Florentine yeah
A	well I've never seen that on a pizza
B	yeah
A	which seems a bit strange
B	pizza Express do one I think
A	it seems a bit odd
B	yum yum yum in my tum
A	no I'm sure that's not right
B	well no cos it's just egg on bread isn't it? With tomato and cheese
A	yeah it's just you know I'm sure
B	Pisa
A	you know a real Italian pizza is is as it is it's not meant to have all these strange and weird and wonderful things on them so
B	put a pizza in the  a pizza in the  oven
A	I might do
B	have you got one of your garlic mushroom ones?
A	I don't know what's left actually cos she's been hitting them quite hard erm and and whatever's left
B	I had one for dinner last night
A	did you?
B	for
A	oh you might be having another one tonight
B	well if dad has got a pizza that'd be find by me but I don't think he's probably cooking what he cooks every time I go around which is chicken potato and veg
A	no and you like that yeah
B	meat in the house so
A	well you could always like peel potatoes when you get there and sort of so that when he comes in it's that's ready and you know?
B	yeah I could do
A	yeah
B	because if you start messing with the the way he does things he doesn't like it
A	oh dear
B	I don't want to mess with that cos it might confuse the poor boy
A	you see I think that's I think he has taken a retrograde step
B	well no just that he
A	I don't  I don't  mean in age I mean because he hasn't had me to nag him to to to think in a different way you know?
B	well possibly
A	no
B	certainly not a problem for a
A	no it's not
B	they
A	yeah and that's that's a very good thing
B	which is fine
A	mm
B	volunteering
A	well if if he enjoys it that's absolutely fine
B	mm
A	yeah he does yeah
B	you know he's he's treasurer and
A	I know
B	what have you so
A	no it's all good
B	it's it's good that he gets out and you know
A	no it is it's very good
B	and meets people
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm you're you're
B	I know what I'm looking out for now
A	yes exactly yeah
B	you know without realising I'm not judging him deliberately I don't mean that I'm judging him at all
A	oh
B	where's my dinner?
A	yes where's my dinner? Who's going to cook me dinner?
B	your dinner's in the freezer
A	well it might be
B	has
A	no she's not eating er very much at all
B	weirdo
A	well she eats about three packets of crisps a day
B	right
A	that was actually for you yeah
B	mm
A	she's nearly finished her bunny but she's got another thing on the side
B	has she?
A	yeah
B	well let's go and liberate it
B	which means you lose quite frankly
A	erm no er I mean she won't will she or do they send like a?
B	well they should at least acknowledge the application I mean if they have
A	an an acknowledgement that's the word I was thinking of yeah
B	yeah
A	erm I don't know
B	do you know she hadn't even told dad? She's useless she doesn't tell him anything
A	what do you mean she hasn't told him?
B	she hadn't told him he didn't know anything about it
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	hadn't I or at some point? And I made a passing comment to dad about
A	she
B	particular effort to see each other
A	you see he she doesn't
B	if he doesn't
A	she doesn't feel
B	then she's obviously she doesn't need to either
A	she doesn't feel that she should have to make the first move and I I tend to agree
B	well that's fine
A	but that is after all how he is
B	mm
A	and I I I
B	I remember that conversation
A	and I think you  did
B	but I think I was always more
A	you've always  made the effort
B	yeah but that's because I'm selfish and like I I
A	it's not a selfish thing
A	yeah but that's
B	so I make him do that
A	no but but there's
B	I don't know whether that's because he should be doing that
A	but that's a perfectly natural thing for you need that
B	yeah
A	it's not a selfish thing it's perfectly natural and you prompt him and he then responds because he will he won't do it himself but he will respond
B	yeah
A	and if she did the same he would respond to her but she doesn't see why she should have to
B	agreed
A	that's the difference between you two
B	I agree but the more you do it the more he it enters his head to do it with you
A	yeah I know
B	then because he thinks right I should call Michael and he might not do it but he
A	mm
B	the feel the thought is there which is probably what it is with
A	mm
B	but he doesn't actually follow through all of the time and he will call
A	he does  he does  phone her sometimes not very often but he does do it
B	and he'll call me and say oh are you gonna come around for
A	yeah
B	dinner this week or whatever?
A	yeah
B	which is nice and he'll call me at the weekend
A	mm
B	erm but I don't know whether that's because you know I do go around and see him which
A	mm
B	because I have done in the past
A	yeah
B	you know spend the night there on a Friday night or whatever
A	mm
B	she doesn't do that
A	no
B	and fine that's their that's up to them
A	but then she doesn't you see she she's
B	is that  is that  true?
A	no she feels
B	what the
A	mm
B	suggest things when he should
A	you make allowances
B	it goes above and beyond what I think is required but I can't I would never question how he feels about any of us and
A	I don't think she questions it I think she  I think she  just questions what she should do and why and what she feels he wants from her erm
B	that's so funny
A	mm there's just a different way of looking at things
B	yeah I would have never have thought that I didn't realise
A	no she does
B	well yes yes
A	it should be up to him you know? I mean I do  I do  feel that
B	yeah absolutely he should drive the
A	yes but he's not  he's not  a good driver
B	but then I think you know it was easier when they were living together because obviously they were there and
A	yeah
B	now that they're not living together
A	yes
B	so I think he thinks oh she's here
A	that's right
B	now why wouldn't she come and see me?
A	yeah exactly
B	so he's not
A	mm
B	being the one saying well come over because he thinks oh she must be really busy
A	mm
B	not making the effort that they should but as to who should start it
A	exactly
B	who can say? I mean yeah there's an argument that it should be dad
A	mm
B	I would say it should be dad but I suppose my relationship with him is is different
A	it is different
B	because I
A	and you are a different character to her so
B	yeah but she's
A	the way you respond to him is different to the way she does
B	that's probably because I'm a bull in a china shop when I just charge in there and she's more of a retiring violet or whatever the phrase is
A	yeah but that's you know you you you get results through doing that
B	yeah but you also annoy everybody because ultimately
A	no I don't think so
B	you just you're you're not as
A	you are
B	you try
A	that's it's always a risk
B	yeah
A	erm but don't beat yourself up for for any of this
B	no
A	very occasionally
B	right
A	I mean
B	that's the thing she is quite tired
A	like it used to you all went over for Sunday lunch there
B	yeah
A	so she did that and then  and then  you see what happened was that he came over and he's done that a couple of times
B	yeah
A	but I find that difficult
B	yeah of course
A	so because you know he'll be here for two or three hours and I think oh God just go home
B	mm
A	erm and that's fine so they get to see each other and that's good but you know it's
B	mm
A	a bit more awkward for me
B	mm
A	and I'm not gonna make a big song and dance about it but you know
B	well but the thing is she should know that do you know what I mean? Like she should think it's not fair on you
A	I know but she's also she's you know she's tired and
B	this is her home
A	yeah it is her home
B	but
A	and when when she's not working I mean she does just kind of sleep and read and that's it
B	yeah but you know that's that's not really an excuse
A	I mean I might suggest  I might suggest
B	yeah but you shouldn't have to suggest
A	no you see she's working  she's working  Saturday but I don't think she's working Sunday
B	I think they should just spend the day or some time just the two of them or if
A	mm
B	but they never do that
A	I might I might  prompt her to do that because she doesn't do it enough really and I might  I might  prompt her to go over on Sunday maybe because I don't think she's working
B	mm
A	no she's not
B	she would always wait for the invitation whereas I'm not like that at all
A	no
B	because I think oh I'd quite like to pop down to
A	yeah
B	but I suppose it's more polite to wait for an invitation but then in some instances when either either if it's family or if it's close friends
A	well no but they they
B	they're not gonna judge you if they want to see you
A	no and then and they're very happy to to do that
B	yeah
A	I mean I'm probably very pleased that you do do that so
B	I don't know
A	I'm sure they would be
B	yeah it's just different characters isn't it?
A	it is
B	she's a funny one
A	oh well I think she is a little bit but I think you all are and that's because probably I am so I don't think that's going anywhere that conversation
B	you and dad
A	mm
B	well everyone's a bit peculiar
A	yeah we are
A	I think we're quite normal when I see some people though
B	oh yeah
A	yes
B	Pisa
A	Pisa
B	yup
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	surely all his films are exactly the same aren't they?
B	well Gladiator wasn't like Alien but this is actually about aliens
A	oh is it?
B	yes
A	oh dear
B	and it's shot like Alien dark and a bit creepy
A	mm
B	so I will be going
