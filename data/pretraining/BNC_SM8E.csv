B	they're nice
A	too salty they were too salty
B	they were too
A	they put erm I think put extra salt on
B	no
A	cos when I tasted it
B	that's
A	it was so salty
B	I expect you just weren't
B	I don't really like a lot of salt but I do like
C	I don't I don't really like salt cos it's pretty flavourless
B	well no it brings out the flavour in other things that's what it does
C	yeah but
B	that is
C	too much of it is too is like
B	yes
C	of it is like oh this is flavourless
B	well I don't er tend to put any salt in cooking
C	no
C	because you only really need a tiny bit of salt
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's a problem with it but that's why they
A	oh
B	sneaky
C	uhu
B	uhu
A	what is it?
B	when you hang off erm okay so
C	like is when you're holding onto the top of the hoop and then you let your legs go off and try and do a splits in the air
B	right so first of all you do the prow so you are holding onto the top of the hoop you flip your legs through the top all the way down and then the knees reach the bottom of the hoop and then you kind of move your body out so you look like you're er you know a figure on a ship like a pirate ship and then
A	so like you're hanging upside down?
B	so you're your arms are there your knees are you've kind of twisted your arms around
A	like this?
C	ooh
B	like that and your knees are on the hoop like that and then you er get one leg up so one leg is pointing up and one leg is pointing down
B	but the hoop is you're sort of hanging down from the hoop so if you let go you would fall on the floor
C	ouch
B	but it looks really good
C	no
C	mm no
B	okay I didn't take well obviously I didn't take any photographs cos I can't take any photographs of myself certainly not while I'm
A	you could have take your photograph
B	on the hoop
A	of when of your face
C	yeah selfie
C	mum
B	what with one hand?
C	selfie
B	that would be impressive wouldn't it?
C	ah ouch
B	let me think
C	oh that looks painful
B	it's not painful it's just dangerous cos you have to hang on really hard
C	what happens if you fall?
B	you hurt yourself really badly
C	yeah it is
B	but you're very good at taking photographs
C	yeah
B	so you could take some today but when I get my actual hoop myself
B	in the garden sad not the living room
C	uhu mm
B	mm
C	yeah but every ten minutes
C	you can ask me to take
B	well no I'll set up the camera so you can take it what is it
B	what?
A	you did
B	can you speak properly?
A	you said that
B	yeah but you're younger so you're just still learning aren't you?
A	I already learnt
B	you've already learnt? well yeah you could both take photographs then can't you perhaps you can take photographs of me with the tablet and
A	uhu
B	okay
C	or the other way round because the tablet's harder to hold
B	yeah I know
B	it is big
C	or we could share the phone
A	mum?
A	who will you leave your tablet to in your will?
B	oh my goodness well it'll be broken or I will have had a new one by the time I die unless you're thinking of killing me off soon
A	no never
B	no?
A	I love you too much
B	good that's good to know
C	or do you love but do you love the tablet more?
B	well by the time I'm sort of I dunno sixty you'll be able to have your own tablet won't you?
C	by the time you're sixty?
B	yeah so that that'll be in twenty-one years' time so how old will you both be?
C	I'll be thirty
B	oh my goodness you will
A	I'll be
B	you'll be twenty-eight
C	by the time so by the time you're sixty I'll be half your age
B	yes
A	by the time you're sixty I'll be
B	not quite half my age
A	no no I'm talking to
B	oh
C	I really don't get that
B	what don't you get?
C	I'll be thirty then and you'll be sixty
B	uhu
C	but how would I be half your age? because since you're thirty-nine now
B	oh
C	and nine er nine
B	oh hang on no you won't be thirty will you or will you? yes
C	that's weird
B	why? because of the half thing?
C	yeah
B	that's always quite random though that'll just be one or two moments that's a mathematical thing so I'm not going to delve into it but
C	doughnut time
B	it doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything
C	it's just weird cos we're not half your age now
B	no and you might not be again or that might be one of a couple of times I can't work that out
B	I don't know when
C	well in twenty-one years' time how old with
B	we've already said that twenty-eight cos she's two years younger than you
C	I know she might never be half your age though
B	I know
C	yeah
B	uhu
C	I'll look into it
B	okay
C	next year
B	you could set that as a puzzle for Mr
C	oh yeah
B	you could say Mr
C	and I'll say and I'll say by the way
C	if you figure this out I will not do homework
A	nuzzling him
B	you're nuzzling
B	or have you did you just take a little bit more food than you can actually manage?
C	shall we save these?
B	yes I think we'll save them
C	just cos eyes are bigger than her tongue
A	please
B	yeah well you were snacking the whole time I was trying to clear up from the party just leave them on the plate that's okay
C	yeah and making an even bigger mess
A	can I have a doughnut?
B	hang on a minute right what you cannot do is have a doughnut when you haven't finished your lunch the doughnuts are not gonna go off at any time are they? they're probably going to still be like that in twenty years cos they're full of disgusting preservatives and
A	I think I'll have erm
B	just
A	I'm completely full
B	well why are you gonna have a doughnut then?
C	cos she wants to
C	it doesn't fill you up though
B	oh my goodness yes it does
A	I'll have just this piece okay?
B	okay it's just nothing but sugar and fat and carbohydrate and all that sort of stuff
C	okay come
