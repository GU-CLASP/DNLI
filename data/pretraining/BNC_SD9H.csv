A	oh you mean
A	I was thinking I was like she she isn't in love with
A	erm
B	ah
A	well no she didn't this is really no it's really weird she didn't meet this guy this guy from Australia
B	mm?
A	when she went home
A	and lives with her
B	oh my god
A	he started messaging
A	well they met they've known each other for years but apparently they started hanging out with each other more when they were in Oz
B	mm
A	cos
B	mm
A	and so yeah he started talking to her well like every day
B	mm
A	and she's like well he's one of those people that I've known for years and I've kind of always like this will sound really gay but you know like vibed with and you always kind of know there's something there between you but nothing's ever happened
B	yeah
A	and then she came back and she was like I had that with him
B	mm
A	like obviously she's not gonna do anything cos he has a girlfriend and everything but
A	she's like I have that with him but I
B	okay
A	like she doesn't think she has that
B	mm
A	she'd want it but I don't think she doesn't think she
B	ah
A	I just want them to be together it's like is that too much to ask for?
A	apparently so but yeah they go to she thinks don't think I told you they had did she did I tell you? she thought they had a moment yeah
B	had a moment yeah and he still didn't kiss her
A	for christ's sake
B	mm
A	exactly what the hell?
B	no
A	just gotta
A	suck it up and move on and the reason I was late today obviously I went to see the house but
B	mm
A	I also had a cocktail with
B	yeah
A	cos her boyfriend who she broke up with before she moved to England so last October
B	mm
A	messaged her today to tell her he is not only engaged but also has a baby on the way
B	and they broke up last year?
A	yeah they broke up less than
B	shit
A	a year ago or just about a year ago
B	wow he moves fast
A	that's what she said she was like what the fuck?
B	what does she think about this?
A	er she wasn't happy but it's not because she wants him back obviously but just she just like oh my god in a year he's now moved on getting married and having a baby and I haven't even got a boyfriend you know?
B	mm
A	it's a bit like fuck my life I have like failed at life
B	mm
A	failing at life and gonna be a spinster and never gonna have you know like anybody and
A	yeah so it's been a positive day all round really
B	oh dear
A	I know she's not a happy bunny she was like no one loves me and I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life and I was like that is not true at all she was like
A	she was like I'm nearly twenty-eight I was like so?
B	so?
A	like Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig didn't get married till like they were in their forties so
B	and look at them
A	yeah and look at them they're like the best couple in the world I saw them
B	premiere
A	premiere
B	yeah
A	and they're the cutest couple
A	oh they're like adorable together it's just like oh Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz I love you so much
A	now they didn't meet till well they've known each other all their lives but they didn't get together till they were in their forties so like
B	you're alright
A	you're fine
B	yeah
A	and she's
B	yeah
A	and you just have to agree don't you?
B	yeah
A	just like yeah she's such an ugly bitch
B	she's horrible
A	like it's never gonna last come on like
A	no like come on like he's been going out with her for what? like six months?
A	never gonna work
B	ah
A	yeah
B	poor
A	so we went and had a cocktail at like four o'clock in the afternoon
B	that's probably well well deserved
A	exactly I was like let's go and get a cocktail she goes it's four o'clock I'm like so?
B	you need it
A	yeah who who cares if it's four o'clock? and she was like I don't I'm like well let's go then
A	so
B	mm
A	it's still hard to hear that your ex has moved on
B	mm
A	and not only moved on but getting married and having children like
B	yeah
A	yeah well that's like that's not just moving on that's
A	yeah he is he is yeah
A	so
B	it was fine er what was I even doing? oh yeah it was fine
A	just not loving life?
B	no it's fine I was just in the office most of the day really which is fine I haven't been in the office for ages to be fair
A	how long do you think you'll stay in your job?
B	dunno I'd stay there for at least two years
A	oh really?
B	cos otherwise my prospects of getting another job in the community are very very limited and I don't wanna work on a ward so
A	oh I see fair enough
B	I need the experience really
A	oh okay
B	it's fine
A	I'm only asking cos we were talking today about jobs and how many like how long you should stay in a job and everything
B	yeah
A	and I really haven't stayed very long in most jobs I do
B	no
A	not out of no not on purposely but just like I was on the grad scheme then I only stayed like a year not even a year in my project management job at
B	mm
A	I'm a hopper
B	not a bad thing I suppose
A	not a bad thing
A	yeah it could be worse I could be fired so
B	mm
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	at the moment I'm fine where I am
A	yeah well that's good
B	mm
A	at least they haven't scared you off
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos it takes you ages just to properly settle in doesn't it really?
A	oh yeah massively
B	yeah and
A	yeah and getting to know systems and stuff
B	yeah
A	I mean whoever can just expect me to walk into a job and instantly know what to do is just ridiculous
B	an idiot
A	yeah
B	erm I think I'm going to work in the morning and I've got a visit
A	yeah
B	and I'm gonna drive home and work from home there
A	oh okay is it closer? is it easier to get to
B	I'm not going to
A	oh is
A	ah
B	with the pub work lot
A	oh I see
B	and then
A	then you're going to
B	then I'm going to
A	I see I thought you were erm having a party with
B	no no no
A	well it was stupid stupid thought
A	why would you think that? my boyfriend partying? never
B	never
A	mm
B	what are you doing Friday night?
A	this Friday night I am oh going to
B	right I feel like
A	erm
B	oh
A	it's
B	mm
A	I'd never trust her with anything
B	mm
A	and then she said well actually why don't you two just come round mine and we'll have a takeaway and a girls' night and like she's making the effort and I think that's quite nice so and we were gonna go for dinner anyway so it's just easier to
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I wonder why she's sort of started to do this now it's weird
A	yeah she kind of goes through these phases though she kind of like is really clingy
B	yeah
A	like one time she called me at work at half past nine in the morning to see what I was doing that night
A	and I was like wow step back love so
A	yeah
A	give me a chance but erm
B	has she got any other friends? not that I'm saying that she's
A	yeah yeah she does yeah
B	quite a lot of friends?
A	yeah she's quite popular I would say
B	maybe she just wants you
A	I think she just likes being liked if that makes sense
B	yeah she wants
A	yeah she likes being liked she likes having people she loves being social like
B	mm
A	like I kid you not absolutely massive FOMO
B	yeah
A	yeah no and then she's going to this party on well these parties on
B	okay parties?
A	didn't oh I didn't know if I I
A	who by the way has been texting me
B	yeah I know
A	like all week really weird
B	mm
A	and then erm
A	but
B	mm
A	but
B	awkward
A	yep
A	pretty much yeah so
B	oh well
A	not entirely sure how that's gonna pan out
A	cos the thing is
B	did you ask her?
A	no I'm not even good friends with
B	who who who's asked her this?
A	yeah
B	only cos she's sleeping with him
A	well apparently they're not sleeping with each other anymore but they were sleeping with each other
B	mm
A	so I don't know I just don't know
A	girls will be girls will be girls
B	mm
A	so can't believe it
B	so
A	yeah
B	the whole clan
A	the whole whole
A	yeah
B	mm
A	gives her something to do
A	well no after tonight
B	okay maybe not then
B	a drunk slut
A	possibly in a Indiana Jones costume
B	okay
A	not entirely sure how that's gonna work out but
B	I hope er a hot Indiana Jones I hope not the
A	I don't know
B	that's not gonna get her any favours if she's gonna dress up as actual Indiana Jones
A	no I don't know what she's planning but
A	crop top
B	crop top
B	but she she may as well just go as Lara Croft
A	she could always go as Lara Croft actually yeah
B	Halloween's funny isn't it? it's just it is basically just an excuse for girls to dress up like sluts
A	oh massively yeah
B	that's it really
A	and not even subtly like
B	no
A	absolute maga
B	obvious
A	maga mega mega sluts
B	just ridiculous
A	I'm going
A	scary but slutty a little bit
B	yeah
A	like I'm wearing high waisted jeans
B	yeah
A	so that's not slutty at all actually
B	no
A	my sexy legs
A	under this entire bodysuit of jean
A	erm and then a jacket and I am wearing a bralette or whatever they're called
B	what's the word?
A	hashtag dramatic
B	er
A	I was gonna I was thinking originally of being really daring and just wearing the jacket but you know like
B	that would rip off
A	well actually no it's really sturdy like I've done it before with erm a top that didn't wear a bra and like so I stuck sellotape all down here not sellotape tit tape
B	tit tape
A	and stuck it down and it lasted really really well like even getting it off in the evening I was like for fuck's sake but I just wouldn't feel comfortable
A	going out in just a jacket
B	no
A	I'd be like if if the nipple comes out my dignity is fucked
B	you're ruined you'd wanna go home
A	yeah like you saw my nipple
B	that's the end of
A	that is that is the end of the world yes and also just if you got really drunk and it all just came off anyway
A	your boobs'd just be flopping around everywhere it would not be an attractive night
A	so I'm wearing a bra underneath
B	always wise
A	a bralette thing
B	wise
A	so I think like it's still like quite revealing but just and there's a bit of support going on there
B	I think you need that in life
A	and I'm gonna take a top like a strap top anyway just to put on when we get out of the club I think
B	yeah
A	I can't I can't do slutty I can't do bare clothed like bareness very well
B	the barest I've been
A	that was pretty bare
B	it was good though it felt quite good mm
A	it's just getting the confidence to do it if I wasn't going clubbing I might've dared the jacket
B	mm
A	but just no bra clubbing is
A	firstly quite a painful
B	risky
A	mm
B	get people put
A	some creep yeah
B	some perv you don't want that
A	I don't no I definitely don't want that so
B	what's
B	mm
A	yeah
B	slutty or scary?
A	scary I think
B	good
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so she's yeah looking she's gonna curl her hair and like wear the the pinny and the dress and everything
B	mm
A	and then just have blood everywhere and be like hi
A	welcome to my lovely home
B	with a knife
A	with a knife
A	after I stabbed him
A	so I think
B	mm yeah
A	not very scary but quite cool
B	quite cool
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there will be one twat who doesn't know who the Brothers Grimm are
B	mm
A	huh?
B	what's
A	a dead pirate
B	slutty?
A	slightly slutty I think yeah
B	yeah
A	the thing with
B	mm
A	with massive boobs I kid you not huge huge boobs
A	so it's very
B	are they as big as
A	oh yeah yes they actually are I kid you not like they actually are
B	woah
A	so like she can be slutty but the problem with her being slutty is that she's really got to be careful that her boobs don't come out
B	woah
A	exactly could you imagine if the boobs came out?
A	everything everybody would be blinded it would be a bit disastrous
B	oh yeah but still blinded
A	yeah
A	it would be chilly so I'm assuming the nipples will be erect
A	and it's the rugby final not that you care but it is the rugby final
A	Saturday afternoon at four o'clock
B	so you'll go there first? wouldn't you go out dressed up?
A	no no no I'm gonna watch the I'm gonna watch the rugby here
B	oh I see
A	and get ready here and just do it all here I can't be bothered to go out and do it
B	no it's a faff
A	yeah and everything I've got here my straighteners are here my clothes are here the shower's here it's just easier to do
B	that's a good idea
A	hey have you ever used the bus from
B	I'd got off at
A	mm
B	I've got a feeling I think
A	yeah
B	but it drops off as it comes in
A	yeah mm
B	and it goes from
A	it doesn't go to this does it go via the station?
B	no
A	I didn't think it did
B	it'll be likely in this climate
A	well no apparently this weekend we're supposed to have a heatwave
A	saying that I say heatwave I mean heatwave for like October
B	well it is
B	right
A	as some woman at work told me today
A	thank you weather woman
B	the dishwasher didn't really clean well
A	yeah I don't know why what is happening with it? it's shit
B	it really is shit erm
B	the jet thing
A	yeah I don't know either
A	stupid thing
B	I'm tempted to say let's just not use it but it's too convenient
A	I know
A	I know it's hard isn't it?
B	that is such a first world problem
A	it is it is a
B	yeah I know
B	definitely not
A	no it's definitely definitely is a first world problem but dishwashers are just so bloody convenient aren't they?
B	mm
A	mm
B	I don't like her I don't I haven't she's just really weird and like brash
A	oh
A	you're quite a brash person
B	it only seems like she's like that with me
A	oh
B	weird
A	what have you done to her?
B	nothing
A	how old is she?
B	she's older than me but
A	she can't be drastically older than you
B	she is
A	oh
B	maybe I get that a lot
A	mm
B	but she erm so she her mentor is my coworker
A	mm
B	and er I just said oh she said oh
B	and I was like no
A	why would you
A	you wouldn't be like somebody's blocked you in I wonder who that is?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I sort of sat there cos she wasn't there and she came in and sort of like oh you're here and I was like yeah she
A	she snuck back in it?
B	no she didn't
A	oh
B	I've got a hole in my jumper so I I sort of like I put a safety pin in it and I'm quite conscious to sort of keep covering it over and sew it up she walked up to me right? and she went like this
B	I was like
A	she poked your boob?
B	she poked the hole and I was like
A	yeah as you fucking make it bigger you utter bitch
B	stop touching me in inappropriate places you actual freak she's really weird
A	for somebody you don't know like even for somebody you know you still they don't touch your boob like
B	it was really bizarre
A	mm
B	so yeah I've got that to contend with at the moment and she's gonna be there for six bloody months
A	god
B	she's just really like over confident and I really hate that in students
A	yeah
B	like I was putting something in the bin and she walked
A	mm
B	so I
A	fuck you
B	it's just like jesus christ
A	it's like the woman I was working with you know when you like you have a meeting with somebody and you know they're a little bit special?
B	mm
A	but you're just not entirely sure why like there's nothing like er she er they don't have disabilities there's just something a little bit special about them well there's definitely something a little bit special about this woman
A	christ okay she says and I got the impression that they don't live together
B	yeah
A	cos like she said he lives in
A	okay and you know when you're just like
A	don't get me wrong I don't think people who have to I don't think people have to live together I don't like I don't know anything about their situation but it's how she spoke about it was just
B	weird
A	weird yeah like I think people who say we're expecting is weird anyway
B	mm
A	because it's such an odd turn of phrase like we're expecting
A	like a delivery? what are you like what? you're expecting a baby for fuck's sake just say you're pregnant
B	mm
A	she was just a bit bizarre and then she was just like and then to be just to turn around to a complete stranger and say but I'm not very happy about it like
B	weird
A	yeah it was like I didn't ask for her fucking personal life I just asked why you were leaving complete and utter creepy weirdo skank
A	yeah mm
B	well at least she's leaving
A	yeah and I'm taking her job
A	I was like well it's I had to keep going back to basics
A	I'd be like so what does this actually mean? and then she'd waffle on again I was like no no what does this actually mean? like
A	I don't understand what this is
A	huh?
B	stop talking about it as if you know what she's talking about
A	yeah yeah like not talking to
B	come again?
A	that's why we're having this meeting because you're telling me what you do
B	weirdo
B	well it would be boring if not though
A	true
B	true true true
A	yeah it'd be less annoying but less yeah less exciting I guess and also they'd give us less to talk about
B	true
A	then I couldn't come home
B	then I couldn't tell you about freaky student boob poker
A	yeah exactly
B	it's just a strange thing to do anyway
A	mm
B	I'm well aware I've got a hole stop pointing out all my flaws like
B	making me feel vulnerable
A	like you're so much better than me
B	exactly what I felt like saying
A	mm
B	I've got a hole and you're a student now fuck off
B	very odd
B	mm
A	like one guy told
B	oh yeah
A	and I was just like
B	weird
A	I was like dude leave her alone she can make tea how she wants to make tea
B	mm
A	leave the poor girl like
B	she's
A	yeah bless her heart
B	it's really weird

B	yeah I've checked the rinse aid and so on it's fine
A	oh shitty thing
B	very shitty thing
A	we're not gonna I I know more about the birthing of calves that I do about how to use a dishwasher
A	so that's very little
B	I think that means it's full but I'll just fill it up anyway
A	if it's not full it is now
B	yeah
A	I'll just keep adding to it
