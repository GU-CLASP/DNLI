A	menu online so I don't know whether it's cheaper than the restaurant prices or not cos the restaurant prices are fairly expensive
B	are they like
A	yeah like by the time you've got like your main and your rice and your sides gonna be like twenty quidish a head and that seems
C	yeah
A	quite a lot for a takeout
B	very expensive
A	I know the one
C	I always find Chinese food is though it's the same with Indian like because you buy things in like
A	cos you have to get sides

A	we had a really nice
C	like found yeah
A	yeah we had a really nice curry place actually we'd always get curry for that reason we'd always

B	yeah we're
A	mm

A	it's only cos you're like going down that road which seems like it takes forever cos it's one er long road
B	mm but if you go round and don't go on that road it still takes about fifteen minutes
C	I think it has less to do with distance and more to do with like
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	tut oh I meant to buy pud

B	what about er
A	we don't want that then do we?
B	mm alright
B	oh shit what about
C	I'm really enjoying this but what I'd quite like is
B	is a decision
C	to pick somewhere and start making some food decisions yeah
A	yeah I'm thinking either
B	I'm gonna go with whatever
A	shall we do
C	let's do
B	she is
C	right okay
A	I think they do set menus which sometimes make decisions easier and they're a bit cheaper so let me see if I can find it
B	she is what I'm trying to be as a woman
C	oh yeah
A	and I'm
A	you're doing really well
B	thank you
A	where is is
B	set meals
B	oh this is set meal A
C	I don't care
B	oh shut up
A	what's the set menu for four people?
B	sweet and sour pork balls
A	hang on I'll find it
C	this is so painful
B	there's a sweet and sour Cantonese feast for four forty
A	I'm glad that he does this too
B	forty-two pounds
A	sounds nice
C	that one sounds nice
B	set meal H for four people
A	do you want me to find it so you can just read it?
C	yeah this is painful
B	half crispy aromatic duck chilli beef hot chicken with cashew nuts sweet and sour pork balls
C	thanks
B	kung po chicken hot chicken prawn no every time I read king prawn I I think it says chicken prawn beef in black bean sauce two egg fried rice
A	that's quite a lot of set meals for four
B	three what? three?
A	three options I think that's quite a lot in restaurants you don't get that many
C	I quite like the sound of F or
A	cos I think they're about a tenner a head aren't they?
C	yeah
A	I think that's fairly reasonable
B	oh there's F
A	does that make you happier?
B	I don't get why they give like
C	yeah
B	sesame prawn toast
C	F would be my choice personally
C	I'm not the I'm actually not a huge fan of Chinese anyway so
A	oh
C	I'll pick compared to the rest of you
B	why isn't the sweet and sour chicken
A	that sounds quite nice I'm happy with that
C	I just feel like it's got a bit of everything
A	yeah
C	and the prawn dish is the weird one
A	Chinese straw mushroom mm
B	well there's two sweet and sour so er
A	er H looks alright as well
B	it's all about sweet and sour on there yeah
A	yeah
C	as long as you don't go crazy yeah
B	like
A	did you wanna get some like non-Chinesey ones?
C	we could get some startery bits I suppose there's not er oh the no the duck's in there isn't it?
A	yeah
B	well we can get erm
C	yes
B	I like that
C	I quite like
B	cos what I normally have is
C	I quite like the prawn toast but that's really hit-and-miss with Chineses
A	yeah
C	some er sometimes it's minging
B	this is what I used to have at uni I used to get erm
A	you can get a sirloin steak
B	I used to get the seaweed and I used to get
C	does it say anything on there about like no substitutions?
B	I used to get beef chow mein if I was gonna have dinner
C	I know some of them are funny about it but
A	it doesn't say but you can always
B	I'd like to substitute the pork
C	yeah I was thinking that
B	for chicken
C	but then that means you've got two lots of sweet and sour chicken one chicken balls one just Cantonese style
B	okay so we get rid of the chicken balls cos they're never as good
A	H sounds alright
C	I quite like them
B	really? my dad likes them
C	but you can change them if you want
C	I don't really care
A	chilli beef chicken with cashew nuts
B	but I wouldn't have
A	sweet and sour pork balls
B	the cashew nuts
A	I'd literally eat any of them I think
B	what's kung po again? kung po
A	kung po
B	chicken oh no prawn kung po
A	did I bring? it's like
B	is that?
A	I can
B	is it spicy sweet and sour?

A	shall we just wing it and go for one of them?
B	yeah
A	the deep fried shredded chilli beef sounds nice
B	that's what I want
A	shall we go for that one then? shall we go for F?
B	er which one's that? F? we could always
A	what?
B	just trying to work it out
A	what? whether it would be cheaper to deviate and
B	yeah
A	or just
B	it wouldn't be cheaper to do it would it?
A	I imagine the set their set
B	so it's between F
A	the erm
B	which one's that? oh
A	why? do you not want spicy?
B	I don't know it's just there's three hot things there

C	black bean sauce is never usually hot at all
B	it's not but we had erm

A	but how many do you get in there?

B	is that further away than?
A	no
A	it's about the same distance in the other direction
B	yeah
A	it's a tricky journey though
A	no it's probably cos if I ever do the A14 it's not in rush hour so it's fine for me like it's not that much of a problem
C	yeah
A	so I like always miss that but the A I go A1 A505 A10 and all shitty roads like no street lamps like dark
B	no street lamps?
A	yeah they're like all the dark roads

A	you drive round the city centre? you live in the city centre
B	have to drive right round city centres
C	the city centre as in where else do you go? you go from here to work and back and then you'd
A	that one road
B	I've been different ways all the time
C	he likes to
C	spice up that fifteen-minute journey
A	mm
B	it was longer getting back today you know the road with the horrible traffic lights?
C	yeah
B	towards
A	not sure I know that road
C	like you know where
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	if you carry on straight over
B	outside
C	that's
B	yeah
C	I drove my car into the Land Rover I think it's huge
B	yeah
A	today I almost killed a woman and a baby
B	oh shit
B	because
B	you couldn't
A	about ten minutes loading her child into the buggy behind my car had the reverse lights on and everything she should've done it on the pavement much more safe easier but no
B	oh
A	ten minutes doing that
B	did you see the buggy? cos
A	just about I only saw it just
B	yeah
A	because it I couldn't really see it
B	I was gonna say you wouldn't be able to see it
B	and like
C	that's ridiculous
A	she was
A	she was in an Audi four-by-four as well so I was like you're a prick
C	yeah
B	you were parked in the the parent child place weren't you?
B	she was just in that little
A	I was in like I was in the proper like labyrinths of
C	you should've just gone to Cash for Clothes
B	oh
A	because they've got a Sue Ryder there so I dropped it all off they did that cool thing where they give you like a little you fill in a little form and you do a little tag and then they'll contact you and let you know how much money you raised for your clothes cos all your clothes that they put in
C	that's
B	my mum does that
C	that's what your mum does
A	yeah
B	Sally Army I think it is isn't it?
A	and they tell you how much you've raised
A	yeah my mum's given er hundreds of items of clothing to them she's like oh
A	I gave like three big bags of mine
B	yeah
C	that's thirty quid
B	we got thirty pounds for that and like really? that's all designer shit you got thirty pounds for it? absolute fucking mug
A	yeah I've got an Ebay separate Ebay pile I've only taken
B	yeah
A	the stuff that's literally I wouldn't ever get anything on Ebay for
B	yeah
C	it's just effort Ebay
B	well I mean
A	yeah I've got an Ebay pile but I just really need the money so I've just gotta get round to doing it
C	you should've gone to Cash for Clothes my mum keeps doing it
B	Cash for Clothes
C	yeah instead of taking a bag this sounds quite bad but instead
B	yeah they for every kilogram you put in they give you a pound
A	where is this? I don't know this place
B	they're all over the place
C	erm there's one in the
A	oh yeah
C	funny like funky coloured thing
B	mm
C	yeah this if for clothes you left at home
B	if you leave bricks in the bags
B	and they weight it win-win
B	don't think that's charity
B	no
C	I don't know
A	cos they're like separate clothes bins for like material which I've put some stuff in cos obviously you couldn't like you can't even resell it like old gym clothes
B	why? why can't you sell that?
A	it's old gym clothes
B	yeah I need some old gym clothes
B	it's new to me

A	I'll be busy I'd avoid spending time with him he's weird
B	yeah I'll be busy doing stuff
A	he's really weird don't spend time with him makes you feel uncomfortable
B	I used to spend time with him
A	he won't tell you he loves you so don't bother
B	he used to what?
A	he won't tell you he loves you so
B	oh no
B	yeah
A	sounds like him
B	and
A	sounds like him
C	that's his
A	he's done both er
C	that's his favourite date place
A	he's done both those things for me so
B	he did that to me before you though
A	maybe I was just warming him warming him up didn't do a very good job there
A	no you didn't
B	he's so like
A	he's getting better
B	I dunno is he?
A	think so
B	he's a lot lazier than he used to be
A	he's a lot lazier?
B	like he was lazy but
A	have I made him lazier? because I'll do stuff now
B	yeah I think so
A	like he doesn't reply to group messages because
B	yeah
A	I know
B	like she used to give me so much shit she still kind of does I just
A	literally not a word from him
B	what?
A	not a word from
B	and I just look at
B	oh yeah
C	I just think er
B	do you have cash by the way?
C	yeah I've got cash
B	er how much cash have you got?
C	a lot why?
B	a lot?
C	yeah cos I got it out for tomorrow
B	oh good
A	I've got twenty quid
C	mm well not good cos I need it for tomorrow that's why I got it out
B	just use the joint account
C	I've got enough for me
B	did you use the joint account?
C	no
B	I've got five pounds
A	I have twenty
C	so wait you wanted to order the most food and you have no money?
B	well I have a credit card
C	that's not how it works
A	yeah the guy comes to the door and he has a little pin machine for you
B	they should stop doing that
A	now you have someone's showing off
C	great
C	no er I've already done a bloody food shop for you so you literally don't have to leave the house this weekend
A	I don't think I would
B	no I'm pretty sure you would
A	that's very incorrect right there
C	that's quite a bad assumption you knew we were getting a takeaway tonight
B	yeah I've been busy all day
A	oh okay that's
C	what do you think I've been doing?
C	so cheeky
B	I really have no cash though
C	no
A	which is why she's having a go at you
C	yeah I've already spent twenty quid at Tesco and now you want me to buy dinner as well?
B	oh yeah shut up I'll give you money now I'll put money in your account and you'll do it what?
C	it's kind of not really the point er
B	use the joint account
C	I need cash for tomorrow
B	I know I know
C	so you're telling me you want me to go out of my way again to another cashpoint tomorrow?
B	oh my god what am I meant to do now?
C	should've thought about that shouldn't you?
B	well okay when he gets to the door and we've got no you're not paying for it? I shall go upstairs and lock myself in that room
C	well if you don't pay for
A	no
C	I'll pay for it but
C	exactly
A	don't pay for it you don't eat it
B	is this really happening?

C	yeah you did
B	yeah

B	I'll I'll send her a
A	I think you should take it with you
B	while she's in
A	you don't even know where she's going
B	oh er
C	I'm not going to
A	oh my god
B	I don't give a shit where she's going
A	do you know where you're going out in
C	erm we're going to a comedy club
A	oh yeah I remember you saying
C	and then I think they're just doing bars and stuff afterwards
B	go in
C	but knowing what they're like it'll get to like one o'clock and they'll be like oh we need to go to a pub and then it'll cost us like ten quid to get into a club somewhere
B	go in
A	and it'll be
B	always
A	average pubs
C	yeah
A	at the point of either still really drunk or sobering up very quickly and it gets a bit sad
C	yeah I'm not really sure what to expect we'll see
A	be fun though
C	I'm in a
A	how many people are going?
C	eight two apartments
B	and the other one is
A	is that a good?
C	and
B	okay
C	yeah
B	why is
C	erm
B	well what would you say to her?
C	what?
C	yeah
C	she well you know she really like
C	she did
C	really piss me off last week I just think she's really rude
A	was that the whole
B	dunno
C	yeah did I tell you about her booking stuff? I can't remember whether I told you yesterday
A	no no
B	oh yeah it's it's pretty bad to be honest
C	oh
C	basically I just sort of said oh you haven't been like very active on the girls group are you still coming to
A	oh yeah for your birthday
C	yeah for my birthday erm but she basically then continued
A	great
C	to say yeah I'm booking skiing and then obviously we're in
C	and then she sort of said oh yeah it's we're we're probably gonna be away on your birthday again so I was kind of like oh great I'm really glad that
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	especially when you're booking it this far in advance
A	yeah
C	erm bearing in mind she did
A	before they've even looked as well
C	yeah and she did miss it last she did miss it last year as well and I am her best friend this isn't just like
A	when's her birthday?
B	we're we're busy on her her birthday anyway
A	when's her birthday?
C	the
C	it's three weeks
C	after mine and that's
A	it's gonna be really cold isn't it? way colder than
C	well that's what annoyed me this year most of the girls
B	she's going skiing
C	most of the girls bailed on
A	I'm planning a really big event for
C	yeah
C	most of the girls
A	mm
C	most of the girls bailed on her birthday this year
C	and I made a point of going and like I'd gone to a massive effort of like
A	yeah but
B	they're clever
C	clever
B	reversible oh oh
A	see whatever you designed her to go for in the living room they're suitable
C	I just think and she rubbed me up the wrong way the last time she came round by sort of like telling me on the morning that
B	she always keeps trying to rub me up
A	yeah I would never tell you last minute
C	and it's
C	but like you know er
B	as long as he's not grumpy
A	yeah
C	I I perhaps er I probably would've been more annoyed by that if we were cooking though do you know what I mean?
A	yeah it's and if you were cooking I wouldn't have invited him
C	exactly
A	but cos I knew
C	whereas er she
B	oh yeah?
A	whatsoever
C	she knew we had to get
B	and we'd bought three chicken breasts
C	we'd bought three chicken breasts she
B	we didn't expect him to come
C	we didn't expect him to come and then like I'd also got the train that day to make sure that I was home a little bit earlier and then it turns out that she'd gone home obviously cos
A	that's really rude
C	and the last few times
B	she texted me
C	yeah text you on the day
B	texted me
C	literally ran round the house for like ten minutes and then we were like well we've gotta go
B	yeah
C	because you've kind of invited yourself like unannounced kind of thing
B	we we were we were eating dinner at mum and dad's weren't we?
C	yeah and I just thought I just think it's so rude like everything's so like
A	I feel like she does everything because er she should do things
C	yeah
A	rather than actually because she
C	and it's also like you can kind of tell when you're
A	well she's only done like she's so
C	I I could pop round tonight
A	much like
C	yeah I could pop round tonight if you want
C	oh you mean because whatever you had planned has fallen through? like oh
A	yeah
C	great
A	hundred percent sort of
C	yeah
A	oh I need to spend time with
C	and I feel
A	I'll do it
B	basically
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I also feel like she thinks she's got this excuse that because her and
A	but you guys lived out in
C	mm
A	in
B	and we didn't see her
C	I dunno she's really shut herself off and like the thing is my like
B	cos you don't crave attention
A	yeah but you're not a dick at the same time you know what I mean? you do your own thing then you do your own thing you're not you don't
C	yeah
A	do your own thing and then be a dick
C	she just
A	when you are there if that makes sense?
C	yeah
A	but that's the same with like
C	quite independent
B	yeah she
C	et cetera et cetera
B	well I'd
C	nobody nobody sees her anymore
B	yeah I said this to
A	yeah I met
B	yeah erm and I was just like yeah it's just totally it's just not
C	and that's
A	yeah I
C	that's probably what I'm more worried about saying to her because I know she'd be quite hurt if she thought like that we didn't like
B	yeah
C	and it's not like I'm gonna go out of my way to say it but you know like it's situations like that when you're
B	when you're drunk and you
C	yeah
B	open your mouth
C	and it's also like you know when you're there it's quite an intense situation to be with your friends like all day for like two days it's just
A	yeah it's very bad to say something that really irritates you
C	exactly
A	rub you up the wrong way and then she'll say something else and then that will just be it
C	yeah
A	you won't be able to like bite your tongue anymore
C	I'm half expecting her to tell me cos obviously she was like you
A	well she does do like the weird heart-to-heart thing when she feels she needs some like
C	I feel like she's ran out of weekends is what I was gonna say because she said that she's in
B	run out of weekends for what?
C	oh er like to
B	is she coming to your housewarming?
C	well her and
A	that's only three weekends
B	none of my mates can come
A	there's three weekends until your housewarming
A	cos next weekend I've got the hen do weekend after that
C	oh
A	I've got Jamie T and the weekend after that I've got your housewarming cos then I realise
C	yeah
A	I'm gonna be home most weekends
C	I'll find out this weekend
A	do you know what you're doing yet for like?
C	we haven't planned anything yet no
B	we'll go and get some meat and I'll do a barbie
C	yeah that's what I'm
A	and sparklers
C	I'm thinking like I'm thinking outdoor barbecue toffee apples sparklers
B	don't care about the grass people er can er
A	yeah I'm happy to like provide thing bring
C	yeah I'm not too worried I don't think
A	bring
C	yeah
B	mm
A	so I'm more than happy to like
C	I think it'll
A	bring some stuff round
C	it'll be a it'll be a
B	we er
C	bring your own booze situation
B	yeah
C	if you want a drink but
A	yeah but
B	we we felt we feel really fair with you actually in the past I felt fair with
A	yeah there's
B	yeah
A	I do stuff for you guys
B	but other people just don't
A	they don't get it
B	get it
C	no
A	at all
B	no
C	I was I was quite like I'd mm that's what
C	through the door was oh I was on the phone to work so I haven't brought pudding
B	what the fuck?
A	I always bring something if someone's cooking you dinner
B	they didn't bring no they didn't bring anything not even like
C	or a bottle of anything
A	wine
C	or anything
B	you take stuff
C	and er she she kind of made it said like oh you know I was on the I was on the phone to work so and I'm like well was it that hard for
A	you've you've been on the phone to work for the last three days knowing that you're coming round?
C	it's just a bit annoying
A	yeah I felt weird I felt bad like coming tonight when I realised I haven't got picked up pud my plan was to go to Tesco
B	we're doing a takeout doing takeout so
A	pick up pud but then
C	yeah
A	called and like you know you just sort of
C	no
B	this this is different this is different
C	well he probably needed like calming down so
A	he wasn't he was really pissed off cos he doesn't really tend to like
C	he's not the kind of person I would actually would wanna see like pissed off I'd be like I don't really know what to do with you when you're like this
A	yeah he just gets
B	don't cover him in icing sugar
A	oh I was what are we gonna do when he comes through the door?
A	hello
B	we'll be in there
A	no I never really see him that pissed off actually he's only got annoyed with me like once I think
B	ah
A	that's cos I was being a dick so I deserved it
B	growing up I was always the host out of my friends
A	I was always host
B	always the host
C	I'm start
A	cos
C	I'm
B	oh yeah
C	he never brings anything
A	I've already cos my parents are similar to your parents about that people are always welcome at their house
B	always welcome
C	yeah
A	and they were always
B	really chilled
A	quite good at like helping out
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and like wanting people round and like
B	and and like
A	they like entertaining
C	yeah
A	so
B	do they like
C	but like you've been to
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you've been to
B	we all had to buy your own stuff
C	yeah
A	he's such a dick
B	well made pizzas at his stuff twice we had to buy our stuff
B	yeah erm
A	it's a hundred percent you know why er that it's a hundred percent why
C	mm
B	did you see
B	that he text me about oh no it was to
A	yeah
B	so he texted me about the tent and then
C	what did he say?
B	well I didn't reply to it
A	he never like contributes to the group
C	no and that's the principle of it like I feel really I feel really petty now going back and saying oh well you know that eight or nine pound that you owe me for like
B	think it was seven pound wasn't it? it was something like that but
C	but do you know what I mean?
B	but it feels
C	I feel petty doing
B	pathetic yeah
C	it sounds petty going back and doing that now but if you add that on to all the other stuff of ours that he's just like kind of helped himself to and not really thought about
A	yeah and the same with like when he's come to mine and I've obviously put his food on and stuff
C	yeah
A	same principle
C	he just doesn't think about it does he?
A	no not at all and like at Bestival
B	breakfasts breakfast stuff
C	yeah Bestival was a joke
A	Bestival was a joke considering and he was literally sitting there eating his
B	with his tin
A	one tin and we were sharing like bags of food that we had between us because
B	the nibbly bits
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	not understanding the concept of sharing
A	I'm just like yeah I don't get how in his head he doesn't see what he's doing
C	yeah
A	like especially on the ribs night when he was literally the only person to turn up empty-handed
B	I know he'd eaten
B	yeah
A	yeah but he still ate while he was there
B	and he ate
C	and he ate a fair bit in the end as well
A	yeah and
B	have we still got the ribs?
A	was the only person that turned up
C	yeah
A	empty-handed
C	I think
A	although
C	I I am
B	yeah
C	it's
A	but just pay for it and I just do it
C	er yeah
B	does he pay you?
A	huh?
B	does he pay you?
A	er we go to Tesco's and he'll pay for stuff and then I'll like sort out whatever we're doing
C	yeah
B	that's good cos he's kind of got away with that
A	yeah that's
C	mm
B	that's pretty cool
A	yeah like he'd always just bring something weird like
B	bring a goat and stuff
A	yeah
C	yeah I my the only way I can think of
B	but what it's
C	or making a point next
B	it's totally different now
C	or making a point
B	it's gonna be different now
C	yeah
B	er he wants to go all the way up to
C	yeah I know
B	Christ
C	okay well then my I might have to start making a point of saying
A	or think
C	come in
A	oh yeah
C	oh that'll be
B	I haven't got any money
C	come in
C	oh it is you weird Chinese man
B	you not a Chinese man?
unknown_female	ah hello
unknown_female	I have a Chinese
B	oh
unknown_female	yeah I'm on the path I didn't know you had
unknown_female	that's cool but er you can see like everyone through the glass
C	yeah that is the most redundant peephole ever
A	why where is it?
C	it's like there's obviously glass panes in the door and then the like
C	peephole is there
A	to get a better look cos you can't even see through peepholes properly anyway
C	so no but whoever it is outside can see that you're looking through the peephole
C	he's probably showing him where to park across the way
A	oh right
C	he seems in better spirits already
A	yeah he'll be fine
C	maybe he's had time to like
A	I think he usually like
C	calm down
A	calms he's not grumpy erm that grumpy
C	it seems as well like his job's unfortunately of the nature where it's kind of like pot luck
A	sometimes he gets the better bit sometimes he gets the worser bit I think
C	he's going into a quieter period now isn't he? I thought over Christmas it would be a bit
A	I think proper winter it does but at the moment there's planning for next season so and then he it's never as quiet as he thinks it's gonna be
C	yeah
A	but erm no I think it's quite nice that he phoned me cos he was
C	oh bless him
A	I was like well
C	yeah
A	tonight
C	is this is this something that requires an invitation?
A	yeah I was like cos er cos he knew we were doing takeaways like it makes absolutely no difference
C	yeah
B	if he's there or not
C	I but that that's that's the other thing though like
A	he's actually a friend
C	yeah we see each
A	whereas
C	see each other so often exactly
A	yeah
C	and that's that's the thing she still treats me quite casually
A	yeah
C	I wouldn't mind her just dropping in whenever she wanted if she did drop in
A	yeah
C	but like to to drop to be so casual with me even though I only see her like once every few months is actually quite rude
A	yeah
C	it's like actually if I haven't seen you for two months the least you can do is
A	yeah rather than just
C	rather than just turn up
unknown_female	hey
C	hello
unknown_female	hiya hiya
A	hi
unknown_female	are you good?
A	good
unknown_female	oh
C	I did I did
C	I did shout come in and then we thought it would be really awkward if it was the Chinese
unknown_female	hello
B	or
C	yeah
B	hanging around outside
C	for future reference you actually really don't need to knock and stuff
A	I know I'm getting used to it
unknown_female	well er that's alright cos I didn't
A	but I'm
B	we lock we lock up almost all the time
C	if er yeah but you
B	unless people that are coming round
C	but check check
A	yeah
