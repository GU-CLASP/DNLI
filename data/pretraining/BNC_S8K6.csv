A	do you know what though? like she was saying like last time about like getting the living room redone and everything I was thinking bloody hell you haven't had it done that long but apparently she has
C	saying that it's not been that long since she got it painted

A	I said I want colour in here if it's all gonna stay if the walls are staying white I said I want
C	see that would be nice yeah I like that like white with like a little pop of colour
A	yeah that's what I wanted in there cos that's what I meant about my room just like one thing that was like coloured cos I didn't like the idea of having a red wall and then red curtains cos it'd be too much red for me
C	red red red red red
A	I've just done it like that
C	ah
A	yeah lime green
C	lime green

C	bird
unknown_female	yeah
B	chickens are weird
C	it's really oh honest to god right I would love that if we ever have enough money
unknown_female	joint business
C	we'll open our own sanctuary cos I think that would be like my ultimate like dream like to do that
A	mm
A	yeah cos then as well you've gotta cater for that I hate is
C	cos it's a non-profit as well
A	yeah
C	erm because they have loads of people who go up and volunteer to like walk the dogs and stuff like that
A	yeah
C	people donate stuff like all the time erm people do like runs and stuff and like raise money for them they do
A	yeah
C	themselves and then the society at uni do fundraisers erm and stuff and then yeah it's just and they've got the café as well they've got like a café
A	yeah
C	there so like are you painting up? I'm painting across which way are we going?
A	doesn't really matter cos you can't really tell the brushstrokes
C	okay erm but yeah
C	they've got a
A	yeah
C	and then they've got two shops like two charity shops
A	have they?
C	as well so yeah they do like they do alright to be honest
A	er cos a lot of them are like a lot of
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but but like
A	they're they're really good at like sort of erm like fitting
C	yeah
A	obviously not cats cos that's not
B	oh
unknown_female	cos sometimes dogs can be a bit iffy with kids and that can't they?
B	yeah
A	so like you go up and and that and you're like you er you take them on a walk and then you go up again and you take them away for like half a day
B	yeah
C	ah
A	and then you bring them back and then you sort of like make a decision
unknown_female	which is so much better for for both like the dogs and the people
B	yeah
C	well it's like adopting a child isn't it?
B	yeah
unknown_female	like that's what people have to do when they get a kid but
A	yeah but they've just got another dog up now he's old he's
unknown_female	ah
unknown_female	so he's like he's really old and that and ah I feel really bad for him
C	and no one'll get take him
A	I'll go up and I'll probably go up and go and start walking him to be honest
B	ah
unknown_female	ah
B	what's he called?
A	he's called I can't
C	Benji?
A	no it's like Buggy
C	Babadook?
A	he said Buggy or something like that
C	it's Babadook
B	Babadook that's a good name for a dog
C	oh you should watch the Babadook we'll have to watch it
B	is it good?
unknown_female	it's erm
C	have you finished watching it?
A	no I haven't finished watching it
C	it's quite good it's more like a thriller than it is a horror
B	oh right
A	which is why I think a lot of people gave it some bad reviews
B	yeah
A	erm
A	yeah because
B	I know
A	cos they're not scary I think we're gonna have to let that dry and then give it another coat
B	yeah
A	cos it's like it'll have to be done er tomorrow then I'll have to tell well do I trust
C	no cos
A	yeah cos look you can still see where I've sanded the drips down
B	mm
B	yeah it is
unknown_female	mm
B	welcome
B	what a terrible
A	so apparently
C	right I'm gonna paint where the white's gone on here
C	and then we'll put masking tape on it
B	okay
A	but will masking tape work if we're painting it?
C	er well
A	drying one to two hours
C	yeah
A	yeah but don't you have to submit your thingy?
C	I've done it
A	mm?
A	oh I see
C	cos I
B	yeah
A	oh shit I'm supposed
unknown_female	I was supposed to ring
B	oh yeah
A	I forgot
C	about what?
A	he rang me before
C	yeah
unknown_female	cos it's the Harlan Coben ones that I need or want should I say? so
A	I need to remember to take his like presents back with me though cos otherwise he's not getting them till I finish
C	his presents for what?
A	for his birthday
C	why? is he not coming back up here?
A	no well I dunno he well he
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	so
C	yeah cos he's invited me to that thingy
A	yeah that's at er that's at
C	yeah I know and he said to me he went I don't expect you'll come I said well I can't afford it and he said I just invited you so you couldn't say I didn't
A	yeah fair enough
C	but I said we'd have to do oh I haven't sanded all the drips
A	it's fine you can't really tell it's just to ones on the oh wait are they drips? are they new drips?
C	yeah
A	why's it doing that?
C	it's cos it's gloss
A	ah it's no it's cos it's it's going in the dips and then it's running out of the dips that's why
C	right I'll take an old paintbrush and then I'll go back into them and just paint it out
A	that's why it's from
C	ah we've sussed it we've sussed it
C	and we get to do
A	ah
C	maybe I'll join the police force
A	do it
C	but the American police are so much better though
A	yeah probably not
C	yeah an actual crime
C	other than when we ring up there's a guy that's dangerous driving
C	to be fair we could've saved someone's life
A	oh
C	it's alright cos
A	yeah
C	and that I did
A	there is they've got a they have to ring the kennels if they're loose and about
B	yeah
unknown_female	cos they have to make sure they're not dangerous dogs either
B	yep
C	well see cos I was the only reason I was bothered was cos I think it's maybe cos I'd approached them and they'd been alright but erm the only reason I was bothered is obviously I live on a main road so and somebody I know who lives in the cottages erm her dog had ran out into the road and got knocked over and died
A	oh
C	so like I didn't want these dogs to run into the middle cos like every especially when it's quiet people drive like
A	yeah
C	erm so I didn't want that to happen to someone's dog you know like they've let them out not noticed kind of thing so I was like what do I do? er but I was like I can't live with myself if anything happens to their dogs
A	no
C	why?
A	on my neighbour
B	why?
C	why?
A	cos right I got I can't remember where I'd been I must've been to
A	and er not and like it's like but on the film when they're scared and they scream in terror
B	yeah
unknown_female	I heard that and I heard it once and I was like well that was weird
B	yeah
unknown_female	I'll just leave it
B	yeah
A	so erm I sort of just stood and listened and I couldn't hear anyone coming back from the pub or anything
B	yeah
A	so like it's not someone drunk you know
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	the woman erm who owns that house she lives on her own
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and like I know her because she made me move the rug away
C	yeah
A	I know her because when
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and that's how I know her
B	oh
unknown_female	and she's really nice like she's like got kids and that but they live away erm and it sounded like it had come from there and all of her lights were on and that's what concerned me was because by that time of night she was usually in bed because obviously where we live you can you know you sort of know cos you it's all the time
C	yeah
A	so like I went in the house and I was like looking out the window and I said to
B	mm
A	so she was like if you're that concerned we so
B	yeah
unknown_female	no answer we were shouting
B	mm
unknown_female	from across the road we're just checking you're alright
B	mm yeah
A	no answer we hammered on the window no answer so I said right I'm really worried now I said because anyone normal would answer that door if they heard someone knocking
B	yeah
unknown_female	and they'd you'd they'd said right we're from across the road we're just a bit concerned are you okay?
B	mm
unknown_female	you would answer the the door
B	yeah
unknown_female	and erm she didn't so I rang the police and I said I'm really sorry to bother you I said but I'm just a bit concerned cos I've heard screams coming
B	yeah
unknown_female	and the house the direction it come from the only reason I'd heard them I think
B	yeah
unknown_female	was cos a window was open a top window
B	mm
unknown_female	and they were like right okay and they went so what are you doing now? I said well we've just knocked on the door
B	yeah
unknown_female	and we're stood here and there's still no answer and she was the
B	mm
unknown_female	and I thought oh it'll be fine like they'll just send someone down erm
B	yeah
A	and er next minute this
B	yeah
unknown_female	I think they thought it was more dangerous than I'd said
B	yeah
A	but erm this police car turned up with two police officers so I thought right that's fine
B	yeah
A	then they proper
B	yeah
unknown_female	we're just coming to see if you're okay
B	yeah
A	no answer it took loads of attempts for her to come and answer the door next minute this fucking riot van come down the road I was like oh my god
A	eleven o'clock at night like the neighbours all the lights were coming on and I was just like
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and like I felt really bad cos I was like when the police had come down all the lights were out
C	mm
A	so she must've gone to bed
C	yeah
A	but then I was still a bit like well why was did I hear screaming them?
B	mm
B	mm
A	and then I just felt really bad that these police had come and like woke this woman up hammering on the door like not even like
B	mm
unknown_female	knocking just saying it's the police hammering on the door and I was just like oh my god so I went over and knocked like three times and she answered
B	mm
unknown_female	and I I just was like oh I just wanna say I'm so sorry
B	mm
A	because I said I
B	yeah
unknown_female	and er I thought something had happened to you
B	mm
unknown_female	and I heard screams and she was like no I'm just a bit shook up I wasn't expecting the police at this time of night
A	I was like oh my god I feel really bad that I rang the police and
B	so was it her screaming?
A	she she said it wasn't me so where the fuck they came from er cos they were it wasn't like a
B	mm
A	it was like repeated screams of terror and I
A	yeah I know and I don't know where they came from I really don't cos like I just went in my house and I was like right I'm going to bed I was like I'm not going back out there
C	oh my god
A	and like she
B	ah bless her
A	but I do though if
B	yeah
unknown_female	I go and see what it is rather than just leave it cos I was genuinely
C	oh well at least you went round and that
A	I know I was just like I felt like such a dick though that the police had come down
unknown_female	if it'd just been the police car that'd've been fine
unknown_female	it was the fact a fucking van come down as well and there was only one policeman in it I was like what was the point in bringing a massive riot van? like really? you
C	sometimes they have like nowt better to do though don't they like
A	no and the policeman was dead nice to me he was like so what's your he's like just tell me what happened

B	yeah
unknown_female	I've saved mine like three times
B	you should
unknown_female	I've backed it up

unknown_female	and I like I email it to myself and then I back it up on my hard drive
B	I always put it
B	yeah
unknown_female	on my computer and then I normally send it to somebody else as well
unknown_female	er I normally send it to you and stuff just so that I know that I've got it
B	it's what happened with my fucking er
A	oh yeah
B	it was meant to be handed in
B	I was fucking raging it was four in the morning and it had like just fucking bust and I was like seconds
C	why was it four in the morning?
B	cos I was up just doing the finishing touches of it and I finally just got finished just about finished with it cos I just needed to put like credits and references at the end and it just like fucking froze and died and I turned it back er on cos I'd saved it
B	so like
C	it does happen though
B	yeah
unknown_female	but like we get told explicitly that if something happens to your computer
B	yeah
C	and you've not saved it anywhere else you you have got not you haven't got a leg to stand on basically
B	yeah
A	cos it's like it's your own fault
B	yeah
C	because it's your own fault but it they're they're lenient er they're more lenient with you if like say you've saved it like a previous copy of it
B	yeah
C	but your finished copy was deleted
B	mm
C	and
B	oh no yeah they gave me an extension

B	cos it like resets doesn't it? when you drop it cos it thinks it's fallen and turns itself off so it had like a didn't say that
C	and deleted her five thousand word essay
B	yeah cos you need to save it at the start once you've made a Word document you should save it first thing cos then it'll autosave but if you don't save it the first time it won't do that
C	so she had to stay she stayed up all night doing it didn't she?

B	honestly if it's in like unless you've just like copied and pasted it
C	mm
A	they go on about like how
C	I haven't copied any of it though that's the thing the only reason I borrowed it was so that I could see the
C	so I could see the how he'd structured it cos I'd not
B	that's what I
C	yeah they did that last
B	yeah
unknown_female	I find it more helpful if you have somebody's to look at and then
B	I do and just get like a bare bones thing

B	yeah
unknown_female	rather than just like guessing out of your arse kind of thing
B	yeah

B	okay
A	tell you what you can do when you're done doing that if it doesn't take all the time just to wrap the brushes in cling film cos then you can carry on painting with them after cos then they don't dry out

B	dainty little feet
C	have you seen? they look like hooves now cos they're that small
A	do they?
C	yeah there's people who've got it because what they would do is wrap it and they'd put something here so that the bones grew like that
A	mm
C	rather than flat they'd grow like that so their feet wouldn't grow any bigger
A	ah
C	and they'd cram their feet into these shoes and there's women that have still got it
C	and they're fucked you know the arch?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	it goes up like that
C	and their feet are about that big and it's horrible so they're walking on these things
A	that must be so painful
