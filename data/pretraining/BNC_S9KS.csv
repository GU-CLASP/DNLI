A	yeah
B	they've brought them back
A	have they?
B	vanilla and cherry
A	oh yeah I saw the
B	I quite like Cherry Coke they they do Diet Cherry Coke but it doesn't taste the same
A	vanilla cherry
B	they've brought that back
A	lime
B	yeah
A	why did they bring the Vanilla Coke back?
B	I quite like it
B	it's very sweet you can't
A	it's so sweet
B	like drink a lot of it at all
A	no not at all
B	but
B	yeah
B	it's fine I don't it doesn't matter
A	yeah I know but it is just a bit of an effort isn't it? like having all these people come round and we probably that means we have to clean Friday night don't we?
B	yeah we should
A	yeah
B	for when we move out doing like a deep clean I suppose wouldn't it?
A	well I might tell
B	yeah
A	instead of Friday night
B	mm
A	mm
B	tell
A	yeah
B	do you use it with the thingy on it?
A	no I use it with just the sucker
B	yeah
A	but even the sucker's crap
B	it is shit erm have you emptied it?
A	possibly not no actually
B	that could be why
A	I could ask mum to bring hers round
B	or
A	could see what mum's doing Friday night and ask her if she wants to come round and bring her vacuum cleaner and have dinner with us
A	yeah pretty much yeah just be like mum can I have your vacuum cleaner please?
A	mm
B	mm
A	it will will be a good good thing though to bin shit that we don't need
B	you're right there
A	that's the thing though it's just stuff isn't it? like stuff like like teapots and stuff that are so nice but you just never use them but you don't wanna get rid of them because they're really nice but you never use them it's really weird I do that er
B	I'm I'm keeping my teapot
A	oh yeah no no I know that's what I mean like
A	there's so much shit like like the Moomin stuff I don't ever use it but I just love it yeah
B	but it's so nice it's so good
A	I just love it like that napkin holder what is that?
B	it's a plant pot
A	oh I see
B	I just put napkins in it because it was there at the time
A	mm
B	what plant did it have in it? oh it had my plant from my bedroom
B	no
A	like I leave my
B	yeah
A	like I
B	do you put them in that drawer?
A	yeah sometimes
A	yeah it makes sense to be out
B	erm
A	ah I've got
B	yeah you do
A	it's not going back to him
B	no
A	he hasn't actually mentioned it so it's fine
B	just ignore it then pretend it never happened
A	yeah
B	pawned it
A	yeah
A	screwed you over bitch
B	erm yeah
A	yeah damn it
A	there's so much to do
B	I hate mowing the grass
B	okay it's pretty nice weather er all the way through apart from Monday
A	okay
B	so it's okay to mow the lawn I feel a bit bad that we have that that thing looks so ridiculous
A	oh yeah we should cut that yeah
B	how are we gonna cut it though?
A	scissors
B	scissors?
B	it'll take fifty thousand years
A	it's better than nothing what do you want me to do? oh I could ask dad to bring some secateurs over
B	ask him to join for dinner as well
A	it's like mum dad what are you doing on Friday? cos me and
B	no no no no we really want to invite you for dinner
A	yeah
B	but please can you bring your vacuum and secateurs?
A	yeah
A	and and er
A	and possibly some varnish and and a sander
B	yeah
B	shall we take it out
A	erm
B	I think we probably should because there'll be an inventory won't there?
A	I think we should
B	there'll be I'll bet there'll be an inventory check er oh
A	there will be an inventory check
B	there seems to be all these things that are meant to happen but
A	I would feel more comfortable
B	oh yeah
A	them figuring out themselves yeah
A	yeah yeah definitely
B	the I I think he must've been the same guy
A	they say he was like a tall older man
B	mm
A	like quite not old
B	glasses
A	but
B	with a camera round his neck
A	I don't think he had a camera this time
A	oh he might've done
B	he had a camera I guess to take photos of
A	but he see he was fine like he was like it's all good condition it's fine
B	I guess they're just looking at stuff that's like proper broken aren't they?
A	yeah we probably should tape up the fridge with some clear tape instead of some colour tape
B	yeah
A	but also if they try and charge us for anything I'd just be like I'm sorry but you are
B	utterly ridiculous
A	you were appalling yeah like
B	no we're not doing that
A	I'll be like I'm sorry no when I moved in it was it was disgusting
B	it was in such a bad state
A	and we had to spend time and money and cleaning products we had to spend our own money on cleaning products to clean it
B	mm
A	to a satisfactory
B	cos it was not satisfactory
A	so I'm sorry er you're not I'm not
B	yeah we'll clean it
A	but I'm not er gonna pay someone else to come in and do a shittier job than I could do
B	and I'm not going all out either
A	no
B	we can clean it to a acceptable standard
A	yeah I'm not gonna like scrub all the skirting boards and stuff no way
B	it was so shit when we came
A	it was disgusting yeah
B	it was so horrible
A	like I'll wipe all the drawers down wipe the oven down and stuff
B	yeah like common courtesy stuff
A	yeah vacuum but I'm not going to go above I'm not gonna clean the top of those shelves bet they're disgusting
B	er
A	and the lights
B	those lights are rancid
A	they're disgusting we probably should maybe try and clean the lights
B	they're so dusty
A	but I wonder if they like they get a
B	they could do
A	yeah maybe just yeah whenever you send an email to
B	know their names were?
A	oh yeah true yeah shit
B	if they rob us then
A	yeah
A	they were like whoever whoever rang up oh no they didn't book in did they book in still? or did they not at all? no okay
B	I don't know cos er surely they
A	yeah
B	that would be stupid wouldn't it?
A	so just be like whoever booked in at eleven fifteen at the weekend came to see the house tonight
B	came came already
A	erm and then tell they yeah
B	okay
A	I went round to
A	so we were like what we'll do is like literally she was like a pile of T shirts pile of trousers pile of dresses and then just put them in the suitcase and I was like see how easy was that? and she was like yeah
A	yeah so I was like how did you get yourself in such a state over packing? she was like I don't know
B	oh dear
A	I was like you are not a qualified packer
B	nah
A	I do quite enjoy packing
B	quite satisfying
A	like not like holiday packing I'm really lazy with holiday packing
B	yeah
A	I just like vaguely plan it and then throw everything in and hope for the best because with holiday packing you know that wherever you go apart from maybe like a bloody jungle or somewhere you can buy whatever you need
B	you can
A	like a towel body wash you name it you can probably buy it
B	see I don't like that idea though I prefer to have it
A	oh I wouldn't I just I don't care
B	see
A	like if I've forgotten it I
B	that really really really annoys me
A	there's nothing you can do about it if you've forgotten it
B	and then it's annoying
B	it's only my fault that I er haven't got it so
A	I think it I think I'm in that mindset because of hand luggage because I only take hand luggage bags with me I kind of have
A	yeah I have to limit what I take so
B	see I really don't care what I pack when I'm going to my grandma's house cos I know that she'll pretty much have anything I need so
A	yeah
B	she's just that type of person what the hell is that?
A	what the hell is what?
B	is it?
A	think so
B	thought it was an ant
A	oh maybe cos that bin really smells
B	I know why?
A	I don't know it smelt the other day it was just I I I emptied it I was like
B	that's only a new thingy though isn't it?
A	yeah
B	that's probably why just
A	I'm so confused to why our electricity and gas bill is so expensive
B	god knows
A	when we don't even turn like we haven't had the heating on since like
A	May
B	not even May I'm sure it was like April
A	mm
B	maybe early May perhaps I can't remember now
A	but no but once
B	well we should yeah let's tell them then soon
A	we should contact the bill company
B	yeah
A	and be like erm we're moving out
B	well yeah
A	on this date
B	if we can
A	if you can just put like organise like a final bill
B	if we can arrange for them to be able to move in December
A	yeah yeah
B	I want to know what this bloody
A	yeah cos
B	she hasn't even got back to me like she didn't even email
A	like I genuinely want to just complain about her
A	but I actually looked on their website for complaints and you
B	that says a lot doesn't it?
B	er let's just see if I've she er emailed me
A	maybe when you speak to her on the phone just be like can I have your email address? so I can just
B	yeah
A	confirm what we said cos I don't really feel safe not confirming things
B	I don't either
A	no
B	that's why I wanted her to confirm it with me when on the email
A	she's shit
B	if I save this then that's the number she rang me from
A	yeah and then if she
A	er call then just ring her back and like hi
B	don't
A	you'd probably just have to throw some mud at her and she'd go
B	yeah but she wouldn't do it she'd just be reporting back
A	send the boy round
B	or her
A	her gang
B	she's just she's just like the main woman and she rings up and says I've seen loads of really good stuff in this house that you need to pick up that's what she does
A	but also we know they're not burglars because there isn't even like a sign on the door saying to let like they'd have to like scour websites all day
B	true
A	looking for people who were just moving out
B	true
A	and also why would they ring the estate agent and get like an appointment and stuff?
A	that's excessive burglary
B	in fairness burglars could do that anyway couldn't they?
A	yeah
B	come to like like an arranged letting give false name
A	yeah exactly
B	steal all your stuff and then be done with it
A	yep
B	we used to do that at uni anyway
B	hi guys
A	how's it going? we're gonna burgle your house
A	really?
B	not not literally
A	yeah
B	but really nice house and we really wanted it so we literally like we the estate agent actual building was like the other side of
A	yeah
B	like took us ages and as soon as we got there this big group of girls had just got there
A	oh no
B	and and and signed it we were just so annoyed
A	do you wanna have a look on the internet and see if the house is listed and how much it's listed for?
B	oh yeah good idea
A	I wonder if it's listed for like eight hundred and fifty quid or something
B	that would be lol wouldn't it?
A	like
B	er what are we looking at? Rightmove
A	Rightmove yeah
A	I wonder what photo they probably just used the same photos as last time
A	oh really? they've put it in the same exactly the same?
B	there's only one photo oh no there's eight photos yeah seven seven five that's probably why it looks even more
A	why haven't they put it back up at eight?
B	dunno
A	cos she definitely could get eight for it
B	definitely could get eight for it
A	er the only reason we
B	yeah
A	really?
B	being so shit
A	let's have a look
B	I think that's false advertising
A	that's massively false
A	and that bedroom looks amazing
A	this is such false advertisement
B	that's when it was probably like she'd just
A	her house yeah
B	yeah her actual house that she
A	that looks actually really nice doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	I love how they said oh it looks better now than in the photos
A	like what the fuck are you looking at?
B	to be fair I I don't like that lounge very much anyway
A	no but still
B	it's too cluttered
A	can
B	I think our lounge looks better
A	yeah I don't like clutter
B	shit what about the mirror that fell off the wall?
B	well she didn't say anything about it did she? I mean he didn't
A	well no he didn't actually that's true he didn't even mention the mirror
B	no
A	should we just not
B	not mention it
A	mention it? see what happens?
B	I don't think yeah see what happens I mean if the worst comes to the worst they'll ask us to replace it won't they? but
A	yeah we could just go go to Home Bargains and get one
B	just buy buy a mirror
A	the fridge we can just sellotape up and say it was shit to begin with
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	because it was shit to begin with like it's an old fridge it's falling apart
B	and it's got just packed with ice
A	I wonder why fridges do go icy
B	I think it's the fact that they can't
A	oh is it? oh okay
B	and that they can't regulate themselves properly cos they're old
A	yep so basically the whole fridge needs to be new
B	it really does yeah
A	this kitchen yeah it just looks just like all like the doors are slightly falling off and
B	just peel away it just looks shit
A	it looks so
A	if it was a person it would look ill
B	if it was a person it would definitely look ill
A	it just looks er
B	it just looks battered
A	yeah it looks unloved doesn't it?
B	yeah it does
A	mm
B	cos they actually can't clap eyes on the place it's all very well having that guy to come but
A	I don't know
B	like proper proper damage?
A	yeah that's what he was like like he was really impressed with the level of
B	cos surely if I was a landlady I would want him to look for
A	everything like marks
B	I wouldn't I wouldn't be happy like I mean I don't care cos I'm not living you know it's not a family home or I'm not living here for years but I wouldn't be happy with like that level of sort of finish would you?
A	no
B	if this was like a you know long term home
A	I think really they need to like just repaint the place
B	they do
A	and just repaint the cupboards cos the cupboards just
B	mm
A	the flooring needs to just be
B	ripped up
A	thing is we genuinely have like we mop this and every time we mop it it looks grimy
B	yeah
A	it's like
A	oh that's the problem with like who's
B	my grandad
A	ah okay
B	hello
