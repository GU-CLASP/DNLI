C	yeah you cut through because it's right at the top
A	she's lovely
B	anyway she invited me back and erm I didn't actually phone
unknown_female	mm
B	and she showed me her house and garden and the garden goes up so she's got like a rockery which they erm they had a ruby wedding erm a few years ago and they treated themselves to this rockery and it goes up and up and up and up to the top and it's the most amazing view cos they were right at the top of that estate that cul de sac
C	is that near
B	yes it wouldn't be far from there
C	yeah
D	it's by the auction room
B	but the
C	the
B	they they live next door to them
C	do they still live there the
B	no no not there they they've moved to big bigger things haven't they?
D	have they actually moved though? cos the wife wouldn't move would she?
B	ah no they have moved was it
D	don't know what she's called
C	I thought they moved to
B	yes
D	yeah they had a place there didn't they?
B	but they were very friendly with them because of they
C	and
A	what? who does he know?
B	the
C	the
A	mm he doesn't know them that well his company used to do advertising but his brother in law used to do it
B	so they're so normal you know
D	yes I've seen him in Tesco a few years back
B	yeah but he's a really nice bloke apparently
C	well he's someone in the rich list if you look in the Times rich list what is it fifties or something?
B	I know really but he's so nice apparently
C	I remember was it who was I paired up with we went on a safari supper?
A	oh yes he was on
C	and I I had one course with him on a safari supper at
unknown_female	mm
C	years ago
A	yes I mean
C	he was very unassuming mm
A	we were at
C	was it you and me?
A	yeah
D	but the wife didn't want to move in to that modern stately home place
B	no no no well yes the modern one yes
D	the modern stately home place I thought it was a bit
B	could be
D	they could have grown up and moved out though
B	yeah
B	but they still had nice both of them work you know they always they remain nice you know despite all the money and everything
D	mm
A	it was a
B	so I've seen her play badminton but
C	anyway does
B	well she she puts in a shift on Thursdays she does
C	but I thought they didn't have one on Tuesday night cos it was run as a business?
B	oh I didn't ask her that but erm I think they still have some volunteers
D	got flashy leaflets now haven't they?
C	they're
D	have you seen them
B	yeah she gave me one
C	but the night we went it was absolutely packed it was fully booked before we
B	I think they must work there
D	we never go there cos I can't work out how you book a ticket
C	well you should ask
D	how do you book a ticket?
B	well it's tricky
D	it's tricky
B	yeah it's tricky but what you do but well what what was always
D	isn't it Paypal or something?
B	oh Paypal yes
D	I don't like that very much
B	yeah that's what you've got to do or but I think you can just pay with a credit card but a lot of people don't like doing that cos you you know you give all the details and you know who knows what happens to those details but erm but the problem then is that I think it's changed but it used to be the case that fifty percent of the tickets were online
D	mm
B	and fifty percent were walk ins okay but in either case you can't reserve a seat
D	no well when we went we did clear up
B	but I think it's changed now
D	and they just let the people who paid go to the front of the queue and went in first
C	that's why I hated it
B	yeah I
C	so if you've paid you have to get there early to get a seat
D	yeah you have to get there early
C	otherwise you sit right at the front but they were gonna change that I heard
B	I think they
C	they were gonna have bookable seats
B	I think they have changed it and they've brought there's also popcorn available now apparently
C	mm mm
D	oh well definitely go then
B	yeah so it's the and apparently they make quite a lot of money from the popcorn and coffee
D	mm
B	I told
D	that you're an expert on it
C	on what?
B	that you're an expert on
C	I've just got an addiction to Costa coffee no one no expertise just
B	they found that quite amusing I think that you go to
D	cafetière
B	because he said something that was just about sounded like cafetière I could make out what it but he said something like cafettorie or something
B	a cafettorie I said oh right
D	luckily you didn't have to say the word again yourself
B	no
B	but he's from Yorkshire so
B	well
D	that's it
C	I thought she was lovely I'd never met her husband
B	I I find it quite tricky actually
C	she did our kids well because she she coached
B	she's very mathematical and
C	mm and she's a very good teacher and the kids were quite frightened of her which I always thought was quite good
B	I find her quite
D	so when did they go? A levels
B	no it was fine
A	too much logic?
C	no not A level maths just for GCSEs
B	part of that I think it's a mathematician
D	mm
B	I think you know
D	oh I said to
C	well it might be her cos she's a very very clever lady
B	I mean I'm I'm not sure to be honest
A	he's retired then?
B	yes he's retired I think he's technical in the medical field but I but I don't think he's a doctor or anything erm but I do you know what er
C	he could be a biochemist
B	he's a really nice guy actually really really nice guy
C	I tell you who they're very good friends with erm the husband and wife is with
B	yes but she mentioned
C	because she used to teach at
B	mm
C	as well erm
B	mm she said about you not working at
C	mm
B	mm
D	oh that's good
B	a little bit but they did mention
C	what did she say
unknown_female	mm
B	that we all know they they knew
D	what happened to
B	mm
A	well she's she's dead
D	oh is she dead? oh I didn't realise that
A	yeah
D	oh so it's just her husband lives there?
B	mm
A	yeah and that's how
B	does he live on his own or has he got
D	well he's got children but they're not at home
B	they're not at home so
D	well I think he rents off parts of it
B	oh right
D	wasn't it sudden or something?
C	well I think the inquest is still dragging on after two years or more
D	what happened?
C	well I don't think it I think it's a
D	what was she found dead or something?
C	yeah and whether she'd overdosed herself or done something or fallen or no one really knows which I think it's a terrible
B	it's not the sort of thing you bring up either
C	no
B	to the husband
A	no absolutely not
B	mm
A	oh
B	mm
A	erm
B	not surprised
A	erm
C	is the when is the inquest on that?
A	I don't know
C	to London?
A	mm
C	does she need to go?
D	I suppose you have to go there to get these medical expert lawyers don't you?
B	mm
D	I'm sure the surgeon didn't do it purposely but erm
A	no but I think it's helped to vent her anger isn't it? her
D	yeah yeah you'd feel like that I understand
A	but I don't know if it's going to be at all helpful in the long term future
D	mm
A	cos no one will ever operate would they if they're
D	no
A	sued for every single one that goes wrong
D	if it was going yes
B	mm
A	but if it's your of your nearest and dearest you're going to want to do it either you want to take revenge I don't think
C	I I went to erm to an inquest to
A	no
C	it was a horrible experience
B	mm
C	you know because they just read it endless statements and it's just as if it's
D	not a person
C	not a person really
D	mm
C	and and and really hurtful things
A	and the trouble is
C	for for for members that I mean like his daughter was there and you know and they were saying you know saying things like well of course he found life even more difficult after he'd had a child you know
C	and this poor kid's been through
D	blame yeah
C	you know it's absolutely nothing to do with her
A	and she was an absolutely joy that that she had happened I would think from him an absolute joy
unknown_female	yeah
A	because he had another another aspect to his life
B	mm
C	and I mean so
A	I I haven't asked but I'm sure
D	they're usually quite a long time after the death aren't they inquests?
A	I guess it all all all all parties will be reflecting what every day
D	if he's a good surgeon it would be really sad if he has to give up
A	I was just thinking entirely from the
C	but I don't think they'll never find they'll never find that erm you know that won't be
A	doesn't it?
C	no I don't think so
C	what did she feel?
A	well she's extremely knowledgeable about all these things so she said the fact that she'd
C	mm
A	erm a good prognosis would be five
C	yeah
A	so he had made it to twelve already so erm she thinks that he actually knew that it was extremely risky
C	who the surgeon?
A	no
B	well I yeah I I well well
A	he knew he knew that a lot more than he was going to share with
B	when I went on that barbeque in the summer just shortly before he went into hospital
unknown_female	mm
B	about a month before he was very worried about it he gave the impression of being very worried
A	but as
B	no exactly
A	yeah
B	exactly
D	so he had to make a decision to go for it
B	yeah yeah but I think and they would have spelt it out beforehand because
D	yeah they always do they always tell you the risk don't they?
B	they tell you your chances
D	yeah
B	so it would be interesting to know what the chances were you know because when I had my bypass they said you've got a hundred to one chance of dying on the operating table
D	well I was told I stood a chance of dying with mine
B	yeah what was your did they give you the odds?
D	my brain
B	was it a hundred to one?
D	I can't remember what it was now
B	no
D	I could have a stroke I could die
B	yeah they said a hundred to one and a hundred to one afterwards so
D	they they have to tell you they have to sign the piece of paper that you understand it
B	yep yeah yeah yeah exactly that exactly that I can remember that
D	mm
B	yeah it's like signing your life away
D	and when she said the other day she said there was nothing wrong with him his liver was perfect he was really fit you could say to her look he's had cancer he's had a big operation and he wasn't really fit really his insides were not
A	she wasn't in a
D	I I wouldn't I wouldn't have said wouldn't have said anything
D	no
B	but it does seem to be an error though doesn't it? it does seem to have been an error
A	I was immediately my hackles were up immediately I thought it was one thing to come and watch a wedding from outside but to participate
D	was a blood vessel cut through? but if if you've had a big major operation like that things are not in the right place any longer are they?
B	so he wasn't expecting things to well yeah cos you can't always see things in
unknown_female	mm
A	and she got very uptight about it and
D	it just came out didn't it? he was fit his liver was perfect this was perfect
A	in the in in the church yard I have no idea what started it all but it all went
D	it started off talking about
A	oh yes
D	and she said she'd been to another funeral
A	we were all we were all going to the funeral
D	and I said to her when you go to a funeral you always think of other funerals you do don't you?
B	mm course
D	you always do and I said trouble is you know that's what is is for us all now isn't it? going to funerals cos it is innit? you get older
B	mm
D	and she immediately thought that that erm he was too young to die and that was nothing to do with him at all be she was just off
A	yeah but it all just started didn't it? anyhow
B	who who knows really who's
D	but you I mean you spoke to him very recent like before he died didn't you?
B	well he yeah he was concerned I I
A	I think it's really nice that you could talk to him
unknown_female	mm
A	cos I think perhaps sometimes your partners aren't the best people to talk to
B	yeah
A	about those things
D	well she did say
B	well it did occur to me just how worried he was
A	mm
C	and did it? you you noticed
D	well you think he'd be very uncomfortable eating and everything I mean it's bad enough having indigestion isn't it? but things like
B	well they talked about it a bit and that you know I think it was like a bit of a toss of a coin really whether to go ahead or not with it
D	mm
A	mm
C	or was it a general conversation or was it just you and he?
B	well no there was
C	oh you were all talking about it?
B	and you were supposed to be there but you were in Greece
C	I know it was a
B	but that was a really nice do it was a lovely evening really warm we sat out and had a barbeque and
C	well he was a nice guy wasn't he?
B	he was such a nice bloke
A	about
B	mm
D	mm
A	there's no one who doesn't remember him fondly
D	but isn't it erm didn't he have a cancer of the oesophagus? was that what it was?
B	yeah I know everything wasn't quite as it should have been and they were trying they were trying some you know
D	but I mean that's erm quite a dodgy thing to get through anyway isn't it that?
B	mm
C	well the same when he was recovering in hospital
D	mm
C	he got erm
B	pneumonia
C	no no erm
B	what the first operation?
C	no what you get in hospitals erm
D	blood clot?
B	no erm infections
C	yeah you know er
D	MRSA?
C	yeah MRSA really badly and he nearly died didn't he from that and
A	no I'm afraid I don't I do remember them I motorbike accident
D	your motorbike accident?
A	no his
D	oh
C	did he have a motorbike accident?
A	very serious yeah
C	gosh
B	yeah yeah
C	what tell us about it
A	erm well I don't know more than that he was
C	I mean was that before he met
A	he was he was
B	mm
A	and they used to go together
B	really?
A	cos that was something we used to share cos I liked being pillion on
B	mm
A	and erm
B	leather jackets and stuff
A	they used to yes yes they did all that
B	I can just imagine them really
A	then he erm really hurt himself and so he stopped
C	after they married?
A	and then
C	yes because
D	well it it's twelve years
A	yeah
D	how long have they been married?
C	mm
A	eight?
D	cos you must have gone to their wedding
A	er yes I did maybe eight
B	where was that? where was the wedding?
A	they held it in
B	oh right
A	I don't think we were invited to the bit before
B	so was that in a church or?
A	erm not sure
B	mm
A	the reception was at erm what's that place in
D	mm
A	the big bigger one
C	where the cycle track starts
A	yeah that's the one
B	mm such a pity I was really sad about it cos I mean I didn't know
D	it just wasn't a very nice nice way to go was it?
A	no
D	it was such slow and for her
B	must have been awful those
D	mm
B	few days mustn't it? must have been awful
D	mm
B	terrible
A	I think she had
C	but
A	and
D	er
A	and
C	and
C	I mean they were just amazing weren't they?
A	mm mm
C	I don't know how they did that
D	no
A	well they're still very strong erm
B	mm
D	well they've been friends for quite a long time
A	mm
D	cos didn't
A	did she?
D	when she was single? yeah
A	after her divorce?
C	mm
D	yeah she did she was living there wasn't she?
A	I don't remember that bit
D	in the old house
C	mm
A	I saw an awful lot of her at that time too
C	mm
B	so what's
A	she'd like to be but
B	she'd like to be
A	getting paid work I think is quite difficult
B	yeah
A	but she's got some issues getting up in the morning with erm some autoimmune disease I don't really want to say what it is because I'm I've lost
B	mm
A	my train of thought but she's erm she's under the doctor having some serious medication for this so getting started in the day is a real issue
B	oh right
A	but erm obviously she's fighting quite a lot of loneliness I think at the moment but they had planned you know just for this car this big car that she's trying to drive that had a big enough boot for him to continue his his work from you know with all his tools
D	cos he hadn't actually retired had he?
B	yeah
A	and erm ah well they'd just organised it all they've just missed out on everything but he'd organised all his monies and things
B	mm
B	but at the wedding she was quite high I thought she was all over me and and I introduced her to my kids and everything
A	what this wedding?
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	she was everywhere?
B	she was
A	no I was I was I was I was six hundred
B	she was saying
A	no I was
A	I was six hundred percent
B	I said well sorry
A	I was six hundred percent irritated within five seconds
D	and she'd slightly upset me as well but I know she's like that because of
B	well I I
A	cos actually she's been extremely palatable
D	yeah
A	when I've been with her in the past few months and that was the first time I thought oh this is the one that I couldn't used to get on with and she's back I can't I can't be doing it
A	I wonder if it's when she
C	what was she doing to annoy you?
A	hundred percent more
B	she was she was quite sort of in your face you know she was
A	she was other there
B	really
A	lining up with everybody
B	yeah
A	you know whatever gear she decided to wear when the rest of us had actually
B	yeah
A	put our you know
B	mm
A	was sort of in the photographs so she
C	in the middle and had to be asked to move
A	you know what it was so weird
D	she had to be asked to move?
B	and she was introducing her
A	yeah she was
B	her her flatmate
D	who asked her to move?
B	or this
C	well she was in the middle of the path
A	yes Australian and I I just
C	when they were walking
A	I remember and
B	cos she was really in my face
D	who asked her to move?
C	and she was taking photos
A	that's exactly how I remember her from old
B	yeah but I didn't mind it I didn't I just thought it's quite and then she
D	well in the church I'd asked about
C	mm very sensitive
D	yeah
B	and I think my my kids are really amused by this you know
A	it was really nice she sat with you at the wedding
B	yeah I did say you'd been there and I said about the
A	well he was very easy to talk to and
B	yeah did you get on alright with
A	yeah
B	she's great very talkable toable
A	yeah she was great and I loved your er daughter's erm young man he was very gorgeous
B	yeah
A	yeah they were all very nice
C	see that erm
B	a
D	so there was a lot going on at that wedding
C	was this before the church service?
D	this was sitting in the pew at the back
C	but she'd brought some foreign lady with her as well
D	Austrian lady
C	and
D	well you see
D	I won't have time to go
B	it's purple oh it's purple
D	I wont have I wont have time to change so I said well look I said you go in and erm if I'm going I'll I'll find you no I'll wait outside for you I said look don't wait outside for me because I haven't decided I was going or not really but I did and we went in and sat there together so
C	did you go with her or did you?
D	no I met her outside
C	oh right so you came and parked up
D	so she's busy talking to all the guests outside whereas I felt that
C	up to the guests?
D	yeah well I felt a
B	she can't
A	I mean I can't bear it myself I find it utterly
D	I was I I wanted to be last so I wasn't amongst the guests I wanted to slip in because they were all dressed in their wedding gear and but she was up there talking to people
B	yeah she was very in my face
A	I think she's just like one of those children at school who all get your attention you know in some way or another
D	what by wearing funny clothes?
A	no just by being entirely irritating the whole time they all get your
A	attention
D	you've seen quite a bit of her
A	we've gone off to we went off to Lacock and did the erm world war two thing which was actually a really fun day you know we've done several things together which have been totally palatable so this irritating lady that was at the wedding
A	I just didn't want to I just I just
C	what was the main thing that she was doing that irritated you?
A	er I think because
D	it was the performance outside the church
A	yeah yeah it just
D	but get
unknown_female	mm
A	you are just you know as a guest you're along to make it go well but but
B	she was hyper I thought and
A	yeah
B	and very loud
A	yes but that is but I think that's what she
D	and then she lost her house guest didn't she?
A	I know she got irritated
A	so I said she said well she's a grown woman I'm not in charge I thought well actually I think you are
D	she was quite nice that Austrian woman
A	I didn't
C	it's funny cos someone said to me after after the wedding oh and it was so interesting because this erm I I I spoke to this woman in the church who didn't know much English or was foreign or something and it was so good because she was just a foreigner passing and and she thought it would be so nice to see an English wedding so she came into the church
D	and that wasn't quite it
C	and it was only later I realised that it was
B	yeah that's right
C	ah
B	that's why she took her along mm
C	but how did
D	I don't know how she knew the wedding was on
A	I I don't think I spread anything
A	yeah it would have been yeah
B	I
C	so were you with
A	no I was just entirely irritated
D	no I think
B	yeah I I can appreciate that but it was funny
D	I think we were probably the only ones in the church who weren't at the wedding but it's not a very big church I imagined when I went to
A	I was really I was really pleased to see those people you see
D	I think I'd been somewhere else with I think I'd been somewhere else I think I'd been someone else's wedding
A	I was really pleased that you were there
D	I think several weddings with
C	but I don't think a lot of the people who went to the actual reception bothered to come to the church
D	don't you think so? the church seemed full up
C	no there was we worked out there would even be seats down the far side and there were
B	we've got a picture haven't we?
C	yeah
B	a fish eye picture that came to
C	it's not very full so it was just as well that
B	in that picture the church doesn't look full does it? it's all down the right there
C	yeah it should hold about a hundred and sixty hundred and eighty
D	it it's erm like a lot of churches it must have had an extension on the right hand side mustn't it? so you're not near the central aisle
A	I thought it looked lovely though I thought
B	it looked beautiful yeah
A	all the flowers and everything was fabulous
B	it was a fantastic do
C	I'd have loved to have been a fly on the wall though with you lot there beforehand
A	mm
C	see what was going on
A	it's quite hard at
B	well you were busy
A	who?
D	does she know them?
D	well I think
B	I think I take my hat off to her really
D	I was sitting in I was sitting in the car park
D	I was sitting in the car park waiting for her to come so we could slip in late but she didn't appear and I thought oh well perhaps I'd better go up and see if she's outside the church and there she was
B	she was kissing me and I think my kids as well
A	and she doesn't even know them
B	no
B	I did
D	sorry I sorry I didn't kiss your kids
unknown_female	ah
B	no
A	we were talking the other day about when this kissing thing came in cos when I was growing up it definitely shakes hands and
D	oh it's the last ten years
B	no
D	well I can remember when we had the French exchange student over for
B	yeah
A	well yes but I mean for us
D	for us it's much
B	I suppose you're right it's about ten years isn't it?
D	at school our
A	well they do cuddle now
D	yeah
A	I think they do hug don't they? it's a much more general thing that people will hug and give each other a kiss
D	I think it's all these immigrants we've had here like
A	because that's it's tradition from home
D	yeah
A	yeah but I don't know how when we Brits have done it
B	it's getting more and more prevalent amongst men now
D	yeah
B	which is a bit disturbing
A	really?
D	you don't know which one to kiss
A	call it a hug but not a kiss as well surely?
B	oh it's a hug and a kind of touching of the cheek
D	a hug?
B	yeah and a hug yeah it is a bit erm
C	what no it's it I'm not against it I'm just wondering when it came in
D	do you hug each other at the men's erm
D	the men's lunch?
B	I think everybody's sort of you know just sizing each other up especially when someone new comes along like me you know I I didn't really go out of my way to shake hands or hug people or I just sort of
C	when was this? sorry I
B	on Friday
D	the men that lunch
B	men what lunch but I mean I I cos I went to the previous one
A	well you wouldn't hug people would you?
B	no no not me but
D	actually when the women meet they don't all kiss do they?
B	but it's happening it's beginning to happen with men now
unknown_female	mm
B	between two men you know cos it's always a thing with ladies isn't it? I mean men and women but it's but it's beginning to happen
D	cos it's hit and miss really isn't it? if you go to somebody's house like I'd probably give you a kiss
A	yes it's
C	no you don't have to do it always
D	yes special occasions
C	or if you haven't seen someone for some time
D	if you haven't seen them for a while
A	but we definitely didn't used to do that
D	and also people at work
C	have they started kissing at work?
D	erm
D	but like my old head I didn't
A	yeah lots of teachers did with me when we got back after
D	didn't sort of touch you didn't touch your boss but when it came for him to leave and that I had a few hugs from him
B	mm
D	the new one's not
B	cos I I found it difficult I was in erm the Middle East and you know every you shake hands all the time in the Middle East you know you go into a shop and you shake hands with the boss or the people it's just you know just done all the time and I was in a kind of erm boarding school environment in Oman and you go in in the morning you know wake the kids up and you'd shake hands with them you know you'd shake hands with every child in in the dorm
unknown_female	mm
B	you wouldn't interestingly when they came into lessons you wouldn't shake hands but then in in any other situation if you saw them like in the socially in the playground or you
A	that would be a way of saying hello
B	yeah you'd just shake hands so and maybe an Arabic greeting so
D	I think it's Poles as well we've got this new little Polish boy he's really quite young about six years old he he came and the teacher or someone was talking to him and he put out his hand to shake hands with her
B	yeah yeah yeah I I
D	the the Poles are very polite
B	yes
D	and
B	Poleite
unknown_female	mm mm
B	but it's very much an Arab thing you know that you just shake hands all the time erm
D	of course in the east you're busy bowing all the time
B	well yes quite yeah is it just a bow or is it a is it hands together as well?
D	I dunno in Korea it was just bowing it wasn't hands
B	cos you could get a headache if you hit and bow at the same time
D	I know I was worried about I was worried about that at the wedding I was gonna knock this little lady out with my head I didn't
A	she was shorter than you being Korean
D	mm
B	was it all?
C	I the funniest thing that happened the other day was when er
D	I was just saying when you were walking round there
C	yeah that's right yeah but yeah but then that's normal for
D	yeah well that was normal for him as well your girl wasn't
C	but it wasn't normal for
A	well she should have warned him about that possibility
D	no he probably just did it naturally that's what he would have done in in Greece
C	yeah absolutely totally naturally but
A	it was a surprise to him
C	to meet to meet this man for the first time and he didn't speak but he just came up and kissed him in a sort of big way
