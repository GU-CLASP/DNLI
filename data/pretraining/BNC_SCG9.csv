A	so I've just told you about some of the plot for the new story I'm writing erm and yeah so this man
B	yeah
A	and it's actually making everybody ill but he's trying to frame people that work in the circus
C	yeah yeah mum after they like blew their cover
A	yeah
C	then
A	oh they'll try and dispose of the evidence won't they?
C	no like say they could they could still make you if they could like hide it but still make it in a different product
A	they might do
C	and like and like say oh
A	yep so he he's obviously trying to put the blame on somewhere else but yeah the kids that are investigating it have got to keep a sample
B	if you get if you get the book er published then
A	yes
B	why can't I illustrate it?
A	because erm publishing but did you not hear what they said in author's panel yesterday? anyway erm but I knew this basically publishing houses have publish erm authors and they also have illustrators so they will decide who is going to illustrate the book
B	what if you want to illustrate it yourself and then actually give the job to me?
A	well I'd they've have they still
B	yay
A	but as I said if they didn't I mean in the imaginary world of me actually writing it and finishing it and sending it and getting published if you if they didn't like them you could still do stuff for the website cos Helen Moss has got lots of stuff I was I was meaning to say to you the other day we should look on the Helen Moss website cos there's actually loads of stuff for fans on there and I think there's
B	are there games?
A	I think I don't know but there's definitely other stories that fans have written and all that kind of stuff
B	but anyway I'll try the illustrations
A	yeah
B	although
A	so
B	someone else can do the front cover
A	okay
B	I could do the sweet shop on the front cover actually
A	oh my goodness stop interrupting me so
B	mm
A	yes so that's what I've got to so far in my plan so there are some other things that needed to happen and obviously one of the characters Ashad or whatever his name is when I rename him you know his dad is
C	how about Tony?
B	Michael
A	no it's got to be an Asian name cos it's going to be like Ashad
B	really?
A	and it's important for there for there to be Asian characters in stories so that
C	comes to town
A	sorry? when the circus comes down?
C	yeah but she didn't have the one thing cos they
A	can hang on I can't understand anything you're saying
C	she doesn't tell them she doesn't tell them one thing cos she thinks they're bored circus
A	she does get that chip off your head
A	she doesn't tell them one thing what do you mean?
C	erm like the family
A	that they don't know she does the hoop do you mean?
C	yeah
A	yeah well I I think they're kind of they kind of think she's quite cool but they're not really they're just used to her being as she is so they don't know that she was in the circus erm but they're kind of not really surprised and the Ashad character like really likes their mum and thinks she's really really cool but Teejay and Katy really like Ashad's mum and she's going to be based on my er student Sumi and she's like really quiet and lovely and keeps the house really clean and bakes for them all the time and Teejay and Katy kind of think oh that would be really cool to have a mum like that I mean they do like their mum but erm yeah
B	the grass is always greener on the other side
A	exactly but Sumi Ashad's mum is a little bit kind of taken aback by Teejay and Katy's mum so whenever they see whenever they meet each other
C	erm
A	she is going to er actually train to do the aerial hoop in secret
B	mm
C	yeah but maybe erm find out
A	can you
C	what she wants to do and then go
A	yes she's gonna teach her
C	and erm
A	can you stop using your hands? because you've got a perfectly good fork and knife thank you yes so she the mum is gonna teach her how to do the aerial hoop and she's gonna be like a quite a big lady like a large lady who does
C	what's a blancmange?
A	a sort of wibbly wobbly dessert so any suggestions of other bits of the plot
B	erm
C	I
B	it could be that the man erm I mean the owner of the sweet shop
A	uhu
B	tries to like get rid of his wife well not kill her
A	mm he might do
B	maybe just
C	mm get erm
B	I don't know
C	erm I think
A	stop using your hands
B	erm
A	yes?
A	gets your hands away
B	cos she might report him to the police
A	mm
B	and
A	I don't think he's I don't think he's nasty nasty nasty like that yes is what is it
C	erm maybe he could like think wait erm if she's er really she could run off and tell the children cos he was
A	I don't think he thinks she will tell but I don't think they're very happy and what's gonna happen is he's going to get eventually find out cos the kids are going to
A	yes
B	it sounded like this stop using your fingers use your fork
A	yes I was doing a robotic voice
C	I'm mm
A	and
C	no
C	welcome to King's Cross station
A	stop using your fingers use your fork and the other thing
B	welcome to King's Cross station
A	that that he wanted to do but then he didn't get round to doing was that he was planning on erm using slugs in jellies
B	oh
A	little jelly sweets that sort of thing so that shop ends up closing down and it could be that if we did another story then that's shop could open as something else and that could be another story
C	yeah but erm eventually
A	yeah
C	the could be a shop
B	and it and it's about
A	hang on don't talk over
C	but maybe there could eventually become a shop which just
A	no cos there's an antique shop next door
C	I know but erm
A	run by the annoying man
C	the antiques actually like
A	what?
C	you know how antiques are really fragile?
A	yeah some of them are
C	and that can like be they can maybe out of plastic and like and
A	well no cos
C	everybody starts to like that one cos they're really cool and they
A	oh a rival?
C	and they want to overthrow that one
A	mm
C	but then erm the only reason which happens is you have to say I like antique shop next door because everybody really likes you and if and and if that happens you could get end up with a dodgy boyfriend but obviously it would be okay cos you like that man
A	well I like that
C	and then then that
A	I mean you can't get plastic as antiques but perhaps they sell fake antiques
C	yeah
A	you know or they're taking er they're they're making people sell their antiques for not much money whereas actually they're worth a lot of stuff so it could be like a wheeler dealer that someone that sell that buys stuff that could be a good idea
C	mm
A	for another story and as you say the man that runs the antique shop he's not
C	oh
A	using your fingers
C	mm mm
A	if I see you using them again I will take your food away from you and you will have to go hungry okay?
C	yeah
A	so erm yeah so there might be some stuff that happens in school
C	mm
A	oh and yeah so some of
B	oh we could do it that that girl is the next door neighbour and in the second or third book
A	mm
B	wait let's say there's a like really old next door neighbour and when they move out they like to see their family more
A	mm
B	cos they're quite old and they can't really do many visits
A	uhu
B	and then she moves in like to get closer to get like further way from school so he she has an excuse of being late instead of what
A	well that was our other story that we had wasn't it?
C	yeah the dropping
B	yeah but we haven't made it yet
C	we were dropping pot of
A	I know
C	erm what's their name? what shall we do? there oh
A	we could
B	we
A	we could combine
B	great idea
A	that story with the we could combine that story with the other one perhaps
B	yeah and then
A	don't use your finger
C	catapult for
A	it's not
B	er yeah and then I
A	uhu
B	and then she
A	mm
B	and then I
A	uhu
B	and then both and then pulls a face at the girl
B	and then she goes back and keeps sort of jumping up in the
B	and then she shoots the catapult and it lands
A	we could well maybe
A	but in that story that we did
B	bad
A	the sister was much younger cos you are going to be a
B	twelve?
A	and and Katy's going to be nine so you're
C	erm yeah
A	yeah
B	it would be
A	but if you want
B	brought her up so
C	mm
B	so well that she could like walk and was a very fluent talker and then she was like this ah and then pretended to be a baby when she was around everyone and pretended she couldn't talk
A	oh that's a nice idea
B	and then she would be like this na-du-ba and then everybody thought she was really cute and then she was like this is really well
A	can you speak that not whisper it?
B	and then she goes and then she whispered to me this is going really well
A	mm
B	people won't suspect me if I do anything
A	that would be a good different story yes for sure
B	yeah
A	I like that
B	but she pretends she's like that to loads of people but only
A	and then she can get away with stuff
B	yeah
A	I like it
B	and that's exactly how me and
A	well no nobody's going into a sweet shop for that one or is this a different story now?
C	erm
B	erm or she could just go into sweet shops and then goes do-go-ba and then
B	or
B	and then a door opens but she plan but
A	uhu
B	and then she gets some sweets and packs them in her little bib and then goes ma-na-ma
A	I like it
B	goes and when someone's going out of the sweet shop she gets out and goes go-gu-ba
A	you would totally do this if you could wouldn't you? in real life
A	mm I like it
B	and then she would just get her taxi and go no-gu-ba
B	and then er he was like right got any money? ganja
B	but erm have you got any money I'll give you a gumdrop it's worth a tenner
A	okay
B	okay I have this gumdrop and where do you want to go? my house but your house is pretty much
B	but your house is just around the corner ganja
A	so what did you learn
A	yesterday?
B	gumdrop
A	at
A	the
B	erm well I had er I liked a gumdrop
A	sorry?
B	erm
A	the book about the story called Shine?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos Shine's an interesting name for a book about a kind of girly vampire
A	mm
A	but there she did a good talk about story structure didn't she?
B	uhu
C	yeah
B	a thousand faces of
A	The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell
B	yeah he yeah
A	yeah it's
C	why?
A	good to for you guys to know about that
B	it's funny that she was like and there's actually and I didn't know that until I found out there's actually a book that tells you exactly how to write a story
A	it does I mean it's it it is a really good book a really interesting book and it goes through classic stories and films like style I mean that is what George Lucas who wrote Star Wars he did use that book The Hero with a Thousand Faces to base the
B	uhu
A	mm
C	erm Luke Skywalker is like Dorothy
A	like the The Wizard of Oz indeed and lots and lots and lots of really good films and stories
B	is Maleficent on it?
A	I would imagine so
B	is your story based on it?
A	well I've always known about the Joseph Campbell thing what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plan out my story and then I will check against The Hero with a Thousand Faces hero structure to see if it kind of roughly follows it I think that will make it successful
C	mm
A	uhu
C	can I ask a question mum?
A	mm
C	erm the bit where Helen was answering my they asking for my quench my question in that room that was my best bit
A	that was great so that was a panel of authors wasn't it?
C	yeah
A	talking about their writing process
C	yeah it's like erm from
A	and what was your question?
C	what did it feel like when your book got published?
A	mm
C	yeah
A	by asking you and it was it was interesting wasn't it?
C	and she was like erm where's
A	and also Helen
B	uhu and I if I ever get a chance I will ask the authors that question
A	mm
B	what was the question again?
A	yours?
B	yeah
A	out of the books they've written which is their favourite?
B	oh yeah
A	which is a good question but always a hard one erm
B	yeah
A	but
B	what's the favourite book they've written?
A	sorry?
B	yeah what's the favourite book they've written?
A	mm
B	ever
A	but
B	isn't it a year and a half?
A	yeah a year and a half two years some of them that they were actually quite nervous I thought Hilton Pashley who got to see his book being produced in the factory I thought that was really cool to see that erm
B	yeah hardbacks are annoyingly more expensive than paperbacks
A	they're a lot more expensive
B	mm
A	I don't really know why people bother to have things in hardback any more I think it must've been
B	it's cos it's
A	important originally but er it's a bit pointless now isn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	cos you know why
B	it only makes them
B	like waterproof but
A	no it's not different it's just literally got a hard back and a
B	mm
A	a wraparound cover they don't tend to do it for every book now they'll only do it for the really successful ones like Harry Potter
C	like Diary of a Wimpy Kid
B	and Diary of a Wimpy Kid
A	mm yeah
C	cos erm like it's
B	I have two hardbacks
A	yeah
A	well and that's what why they do it I think cos they know
B	oh yeah
A	that you you can't wait
B	yeah two hardbacks every single one that's been out I have
A	yeah
B	it started off as a
A	where? where?
B	erm at my dance thing erm the
A	oh right
B	yeah and
A	is that what happened?
B	yeah and then I read it and I really liked it so
A	oh
B	dad got the second one
A	mm
B	and then the third
A	mm
B	and then the fourth
A	well then
C	and you got
A	birthday and Christmas er
C	and you got some
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I think my personal favourite I don't really have one cos I've lost count
C	erm
B	where he can become a millionaire
C	what about the last one?
A	he probably is a millionaire
B	no he probably can become one because he has a ring that's worth a load of money
A	who? Jeff Kinney?
B	er no
A	oh
A	oh really?
B	yeah he found a ring in the Easter egg
A	right
B	there is a family heirloom but in
A	mm
B	but he's ever er gets a really big urge to get a jetpack or something
B	then he might want to
A	does he know it that it's definitely valuable?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	cos it's a real diamond
A	but why has he got the ring?
C	because
B	because he found it
C	yeah because erm
A	was he meant to find it though?
B	erm it wasn't
C	no because erm they had a great great great great grandma and
A	right
C	at her funeral
A	oh yeah?
C	he found out she wasn't wearing her diamond ring
B	and apparently and and it was worth a huge amount
A	so has why has he not told his parents that he's got it?
C	because they'll just want
A	is he just
B	cos
A	keeping it for a rainy day?
B	because his mum would like to give it back but as they found out in in like an thing she was wearing
A	mm
B	a ring
A	mm
B	the ring when she was baking an apple pie
A	oh okay
B	it wasn't on there when she was putting it in the when she was putting stuff in the Easter eggs
C	and they
B	and then they knew what it meant that whoever got the Easter egg with it in would have the ring and it would be bestowed to them
A	so how many books has he had has he kept the ring for?
B	erm
C	er er
B	only like one
C	a lot because it was in well
A	quite an early one?
B	quite an early one
C	which one? was it in the blue one?
B	er no it was in the light green one? hardback
C	oh
B	it's quite a late one although I've lost track I think it's the fourth one?
A	but it didn't think he didn't he didn't think at all that he should tell his parents?
C	no
B	that he didn't think
B	at all
C	cos basically they are grown-ups
B	oh I think it's
C	so I think he thought
B	the fifth one
A	okay
B	erm no
C	if the grown-ups thought
B	er sorry
B	yeah they would give it back to
C	if his mum
B	their his great granny but they wouldn't just trade it for loads of money
B	or even keep it save they'd just give it to a they'd say I think this should be given to granny and then
A	well it should really
B	and then loads of people would sell it
C	mum mum
A	cos she does own it
C	mum can I finish
B	no to like their granny not their great granny
A	oh I see
