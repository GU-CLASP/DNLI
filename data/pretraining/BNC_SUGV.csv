B	yeah but yeah well what about the people I don't know how old that is I would imagine it's Victorian if not older but
A	when they felt when they were

C	mm
B	what do you think would make you most happy then guys? or what do you think makes people happy? cos you'd often you were talking about the lottery yesterday do you think if we you won a million pounds would that make you happy?
C	yeah
A	no
B	right so
C	why?
B	no well no no let's hear her first let's hear her first and then let's let her let's have your opinion first
C	yeah I think you'd probably be happy cos er you had just become a millionaire
B	but why would that make you happy?
C	cos you could buy loads of awesome stuff
B	you could buy loads of awesome stuff yes and
C	and for some reason er materials make people feel happy
B	true
A	because I would like feel bad for all the people who lost the lottery
B	would you?
A	yeah because they've been trying their
C	but
B	but you could but you could use some of your money to for the good you could set up a charity couldn't you?
A	yeah
C	you could give all the money to charity if you won like sixty thousand million
B	you could yeah
A	I'll feel bad and good
B	but do you think anyone else that won it would think about the people that lost?
A	no cos they might
C	barely anyone does believe me
A	cos they might think
A	cos they will definitely I think they will definitely think yay I won so I'm gonna get all this fancy stuff a mansion a really
C	what? like a Lamborghini?
A	yeah
B	well you can buy lots of er expensive things but what good could you? I mean
C	oh
B	and we wouldn't necessarily have to worry about money again which would be nice but er you don't have to just spend it on yourself you could spend it on your friends or people who need help
A	yeah but
C	mm
A	but what if my friends entered the lottery as well and they all
B	I think you need to be stop worrying about the other people that entered the lottery
A	yeah
B	really
C	cos they might have won it before
B	I would like to have a bath of jelly we could do that with the lottery
C	oh yeah
A	mum we could just
B	cos we've wanted that for years haven't we?
C	mm
C	we'd have to have a normal bath first
B	hang on hang on hang on hang on right so
A	we could basically just like save up our money to get jelly
B	we could I know but it would we would need a lot what were you gonna say
C	well
B	why?
C	cos you could eat the jelly cos it would
B	well if we were if we were millionaires we could employ someone to bring a bath er just for jelly and then take it away again er why do you think people think money having money would make them happier? you don't know?
A	mm well
B	well some people not everybody enjoys their job so if they didn't have to
C	because then they wouldn't be able to see their friends at work it would mean that they were just they would lose a lot of money
B	they wouldn't lose a lot of money if they had millions but I think they'd get bored
C	yeah
B	did you know there was
A	I wouldn't
B	there was no you probably wouldn't there was a man that won the lottery a while ago he was nineteen and he'd been in and out of prison and I think he won two million pounds or something like that and he spent it all all of that money
A	how? on what?
B	he raced cars he bought a big house he had lots of parties and people all of his neighbours didn't like him because he was really antisocial and he had lots of
C	no
B	so I think it depends on the kind of person you are if I had a million pounds I would give lots of it away to charity and I'd probably set up my own charity and I would give lots of money to our friends that needed it and I would buy an aerial hoop and lots of jelly
A	and we would go
B	you would jump on it?
C	yeah and we'd
B	well you'd hurt yourself
C	and we'd erm er make somebody cushion all the walls
B	right
B	you could have a bouncy room
C	yeah we could have like this entire we could pay the neighbours to move out
C	and then we could
B	do you know what? it makes me laugh that even if
C	I know exactly what we could do
B	okay
C	erm all the neighbours next to us and all the neighbours in front of us pay all of them to move out
B	so we'd have this whole strip of nine houses
C	yeah and then we'd and then we'd go
C	maybe people erm loads of people
B	stop a minute stop interrupting
A	I think er I think we have er
B	there are nine houses in this bit go on
C	and then
B	but what would we have in it? oh shall we have a disco room?
C	disco room
A	yeah or a cinema
B	a cinema room

B	and
C	yeah we could have a
B	and a fireman's pole

B	I would like to have
B	no we're not having a lift

B	mm I like the music room that would be soundproofed so we could play all our instruments all er all the time without disturbing the neighbours
A	yeah and
B	yeah
A	we won't have any neighbours
B	we won't have any neighbours
B	okay well we'll eventually we'll have neighbours
C	no because we'll've not we will have made their houses like part of ours
A	we've got some neighbours
B	but there's still the houses around here
C	mm
A	we've got some neighbours back there
B	yeah the we'll still have some neighbours I think probably eventually if we had millions of pounds I would be able to persuade you to move out of this house and go into a bigger nicer house
A	no
B	no
C	but we have a great school
B	well no in the village still in the village
B	that's what I that's what I said to

B	we can't get an invisibility cloak cos that's not a real thing
A	a hoverboard
B	what about a holiday home in Spain?
A	yeah
C	or we could build a giant mansion around the entire planet
B	I don't think we've got enough money to do that
A	mm
C	we would enter the lottery no we would be in the lottery group and find out exactly which
B	okay
C	and the numbers
B	well the good thing about having lots of money is that you do earn interest on it in the bank so they give you a little bit of money for all the savings that you have so that would earn money on its own
