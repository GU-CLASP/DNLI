A	okay
B	because I just bought a pack I bought the sort of what was all sealed together in the plastic
A	mm mm
B	which was three of them no it was an odd one and two of them but I think I've got another one somewhere
A	do you want to come and sit along here? then we'll get the erm we can make sure that it looks alright on the recording
B	that's the way I want
A	have you lost something?
B	my shopping list
A	oh it could be I think there's something there that looks like your writing
B	oh that was it it all got shoved up together thanks thank you I need to write erm
A	cranberry perhaps
B	I know this needs rewriting cranberry
A	are you planning a shopping trip tomorrow?
B	no this is my old
A	oh right
B	it's what I haven't got
A	mm mm
B	it's just that I we could go to my man if you would like? I mean
A	and would would that be to buy the cards for auntie
B	we could have a look for a card for auntie
A	mm yeah
B	and erm I don't know that she wants one with eighty-five on but you know
A	oh is she going to be eighty-five this year?
B	I think so yes
A	mm no I'm I'm a bit in two minds about whether
B	but erm
A	you should put years on cards
B	yeah well I mean apart from key key
A	what like a hundred or something?
B	no you know when it's like
A	twenty-one
B	sixty or fifty or twenty-one
A	yes yes
B	that kind of thing
A	yes but some people
B	we can
A	are more sensitive than others about it
B	we could ask I just sent an ordinary card to
A	right
B	to be naughty
A	yeah
B	yes so erm we could go to my man see you could have a see if he's got any diaries and I don't know whether he has
A	mm
B	erm he'll probably have the one like mine but whether he's got any I think he
A	oh yes
B	I think he has that sort of shape and we could go and see
A	mm
B	what he's got and see if there's an auntie
A	I could erm
B	and ask him if he's got any line on key
A	tabs
B	tabs
A	tabs fobs
B	tabs or fobs
A	yes
B	one might be American I don't know
A	I've never really heard either
B	yeah
A	I would just think of them as little calendars
B	yes but erm the lady in Wilko knew what we were talking about
A	yes and I checked on the website
B	yeah yeah
A	and they weren't in
B	no because I was too early going in cos they hadn't even got their dairies erm cos the lady in there said we haven't got ours yet but if you go to Clintons Cards or you know one of these sorts of shops
A	yeah
B	she said if you go to one of those they'll have they'll have
A	oh Wilko's yeah
B	she says because we haven't got ours yet you know so I know they've got them I thought I don't think they'll want you to divert your
A	yes yes
B	rather than saying they're in next week get one in there
A	yeah the lady in the
B	oh yes yeah yes they usually are cos I wasn't
A	mm
B	but a lot of more recent children may not have done that
A	no
B	as a craft activity
A	I mean it still seems to be you can buy them in bulk
B	you can buy them yes but you know
A	yeah
B	how many schools actually have people who do
A	mm
B	or like
A	yes yes
B	ink and the
A	mm
B	put it sort of swirl it about and you put the paper on and I don't think you run the paper through it because it would be smeary put the paper on
A	mm
B	it's probably just decent cartridge paper as we used to have in those days and it's got the it has all this sort of dotty swirly patterns on in the did you do that? and then we used that to cover a board you know mitre and cover
A	oh yes I know about mitring and covering
B	and put the ribbon on and put the little thing for the
A	yes
B	and the background was this sort of you know you could
A	yeah
B	I think you know there was like a pinkie one and a bluey one a green one and you could and er I didn't do that you know I I made the calendar with the paper but I didn't do the oil on water business but I saw it in I used to have this I guess I got it for a Christmas present
A	yeah
B	one of these books of you know
B	oh erm
A	choccy in the trousers
B	erm chocolate trouser uh books of like things to do and it always looked really exciting but I didn't think it was ever gonna happen
A	yeah
B	erm and last year we went to the
A	yes
B	indeed it's on today
A	yes
B	Christmas fair there
A	yes
B	and they had somebody who was selling kind of kits of that
A	oh right
B	it was quite impressive
A	yeah
B	and you could do it on paper you could do it on anything and I can't think quite how it all worked now but it was obviously some sort of you made patterns out of inks because you could even do it on fabric you know it was it was safe
A	yeah but
B	and dry as soon as it came out
B	yeah well it's something where you do it kind it's like on water or unless you do it on oil unless it's oil unless it's a tray of oil with ink on inks on it it's something where where the the erm coloured stuff is on the surface of the
A	yeah yeah I understand the principle
B	but I don't know whether it's oil with water water ink or water with oil ink
A	mm mm
B	you know which way around it is cos
A	yes
B	arty crafties
A	yeah it was sad his daughter isn't it? that she had such an awful time do you remember I got that letter she had such an awful time at
B	his daughter
A	he had one daughter
B	yes I had her hockey boots in fact we had her
A	oh right
B	remember the black hockey boots
A	yes I do
B	that laced up that took you hours to get into?
B	because there was not they were proper hockey boots they looked like
A	I think everyone had to have them
B	I know but they'd I mean they were sort of things you had to have for school but
A	mm
B	because they looked like erm what used to be sort of those American plimsoll things that came up to your
A	yes
B	you know what I mean? they looked like those with knobbly
A	mm I think they're called baseball shoes
B	baseball boots
A	no I don't know
B	they're like they used to be like erm
A	yes I know I have some
B	yes and they but they had a knobbly underfoot
A	mm
B	but it used to take me hours to get them on
A	yes then there was hockey
B	and then you had to run to the top of the field and back so by the time I'd done that
A	yes
A	and it always seemed to be cold and horrible when we played hockey
B	yes
A	but some people it seems enjoy the sport
B	some people
A	anyway I was telling you about
A	daughter
B	who married a German man
A	erm I wrote a letter to her after I found that
B	oh right yes
A	and I must have given her my email perhaps
B	yes
A	well I guess I must have
B	mm
A	and she emailed back saying how nice to have the letter
B	yes
A	and she was er pleased to hear I had a good er we both had a good experience with
B	yes
A	because erm she was put in
B	mm no
A	because normally at
B	no
A	and she said she had the most horrid time being taught by him
B	yeah
A	she really hated it and it was really
B	yes
A	coloured her view of being at
B	yes but she was a bit older than me
A	was she? oh
B	she passed on the hockey boots so she would've left she would've already have left wherever whatever school she was at presumably unless her feet grew rapidly erm
A	mm yeah I don't I don't I don't think I've ever met her
B	so she could be like five years older than me
A	mm
A	probably
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well it's a bit much isn't it? cos you've er erm if you've got your father all day and at home as well
A	for two whole years
B	because was she was an only child as well wasn't she?
A	mm mm
B	so she
A	but I was I mean it it has happened because
B	well it's just the way it worked out cos she'd be in the As
A	I think they tried to manage it so we didn't get in our parent's class or it may have just been
B	well er you can't help it if if in like in those days
A	or
B	or
A	or
B	dunno whether
A	mm
B	he did well he
A	mm
B	three A four A he might've done
A	mm
B	I don't
B	yeah
A	three A four A
B	four
A	that was
B	oh that was
A	the the er the other boy
B	yeah but I mean it is difficult from that point of view because if you only have say three
A	mm
B	who are going to do that
A	mm
B	then the
A	mm
B	is quite high
A	yeah
B	mm up to a point
A	because dad didn't always
B	oh he he occasionally he did he he did erm the remove one year
A	and he has he needed to have the C and D classes
B	mm
A	didn't he?
B	well that's it that's what I say the remove
A	mm
B	which was
A	mm
B	sort of
A	mm
B	mm
A	it was a nice letter tonice erm email from
B	yes saying saying about father yeah
A	saying how much saying how much he er he was a lost eleven-year-old and how he helped and
B	yes
A	without
B	no
B	well when we heard that programme I told
A	mm and he is just so like
B	yeah
A	I mean I don't know whether I mean that that sort of look
B	mm
A	erm I mean the all the
B	yes
A	but you know because he's got the dark hair
B	mm
A	and some of the sort of some of the clothes you were showing that belonged to
B	yeah
A	but I don't suppose I'll ever get to see the
B	no
A	up with with
B	well
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	type thing
A	well he could have applied to the BBC but
B	but er you know it it wasn't
A	well he kind of wanted to stay in
B	no I mean earlier earlier when he was at university he could have gone into sound
A	yes well we all could have gone into many different things
B	computers and things he did electronics but you see sound engineer wasn't kind of a
A	mm
B	kind of an acceptable career path in some ways
A	mm
B	in our in in those days because they they didn't I mean now I mean like like is it
A	one of them is isn't he? yeah
B	yeah but they were both a bit sort of something in that direction because that one was only working in an estate agents as a
A	oh yes that was
B	temporary job
A	no no it was his while he was a term-time job at university
B	yeah and that's what I mean it was a just a
A	it meant he had a car because
B	yeah
A	either he was given the car to do the job or he had the car because
B	but there were actually courses on
A	mm
B	sound engineering and things where
A	yeah I think it would do I think
B	you can now but
A	there's something
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know the old poly
B	yeah
A	there's erm I think they have the best course of the type in something to do with audio or something to do because erm er oh a friend of somebody came up anyway
B	yes well this is it it's a more recent kind of thing especially with all the digital and stuff
A	mm
B	and
A	and there's lots of things now that
B	yes
A	because I always thought it was interesting the erm the upstairs downstairs the downstairs bit of the upstairs downstairs of you know like things like stately homes and actually finding out how ordinary people lived cos history was all about the the posher people it seems
B	well
A	but there was so little it wasn't I mean perhaps it was done at school some of them
B	yeah
A	but it wasn't it wasn't thought worthy of university
B	oh no no
A	university didn't want to be thinking about things like that
B	oh no
A	and the National Trust whatever it was doing was not it it's only in the last ten years
B	might have done kings and queens
A	that it's opened up you know the
B	yeah
A	other areas like the dairy and the you know it's it's the
B	that's right we only do the kings and queens and the royal
A	and the and er where do where is it
B	we went somewhere where somebody was doing butter or cheese or
A	oh yes that was erm
B	something somewhere
A	that
B	yes
A	they do more with the erm the other people because until recently they they didn't do anything about the Polish folk who were down there
B	no
A	cos they were living in
B	yes yeah
A	and that was I mean there were other things too and they just weren't weren't jobs
B	yes
A	and stuff with biology was very limited and when I was at school I wanted to do design stuff in art choosing erm er things from the biology slides you know
B	yes
A	when you put make a slide and you stain it?
B	yes
A	and use the shapes and the colours from those
B	yes
A	and that was thought to be a a non-thing to do
B	well that might have been and gone because that was big in the early sixties
A	well nobody thought it was a worthy thing to spend time doing in art
B	well this is it you see the likes of erm
A	mm mm mm
B	which was an innovation
A	yes
B	and at college we used to do well it's like my pottery and things seed pods and cross-sections and all of that which was late sixties erm but it kind of had been and gone by the time you got to do yours probably
A	well maybe
B	and wasn't considered
A	it wasn't considered a thing to do
B	a thing it wasn't a thing it wasn't in vogue either really
A	no
B	and you see with
A	mm that's what I used at university
B	but erm that was you know in when did
A	mm
B	cos it wasn't something you did at university
A	university in nineteen eighty-two or nineteen eighty-three I was doing ecology and statistics and ecology and you had to use a mainframe linked to a mainframe that was in the States or something
B	yes
A	you know was and you know you put you punched it all in and whatever you had to do
B	yes
A	and then you got like forty-two out you know?
B	yes was was it because as I say
A	and so yeah eighty-two and then by the time eighty-five the end of eighty-five no the yeah the autumn eighty-five
B	mm
A	we were getting erm PCs
B	mm
A	which you know are still recognisable in some ways although people people wouldn't know what to do with them if if they've only used a
B	mm
A	Windows eight environment or whatever
B	well that's what
A	mm
B	because he said because this thing is derived from you know something back
A	mm
B	you know previously
A	yeah
B	so that's how you know it's developed from that so you know on the logic of erm you know that's how that was kind of evolved so it's working that you know cos
A	mm
B	and things or they'd come across something that had something that was a bit old in it and they wouldn't know what to do and
A	mm
B	I mean they didn't all work like that but you know he knew the ones that which they hadn't got any idea of what
A	no
B	you know they
A	mm
B	things further back cos he'd been sort of on the more or less the whole lot of it
A	and I rather suspect that erm
B	yeah
A	well he's an academic at
B	I don't know what his actual qualifications are in that sense
A	no but he's he's in the computing area isn't he?
B	mm I mean he won't he may not know the ins and outs of it but somebody has to for him to have set up the stuff in the museum
A	yes so
B	and that's why
A	oh yes
B	with the Sun stuff he could have helped him with the Sun stuff
A	that would have been oh he probably could have helped with all sorts of things actually
B	well all of it but he
A	yeah it would be brilliant if erm
B	the
A	did I tell you I had that email from
B	yes saying yes
A	and he still looks happy and keen
B	yeah
A	and in the email I sent I did emphasise about erm you know that
B	yes
A	and you know that cos in case he just forgot who we were cos it's been a while since we've been in touch
B	well as I say and it also would be worth mentioning that having
A	oh yeah er well I I think I mentioned him originally
B	originally because had
A	mm cos it's not like a million miles away but it is a bit awkward isn't it?
B	it's not a million miles but it's an awkward thing to sort of commute to
A	cos that journey's a bit not very nice is it?
B	no it's little roads and things but if it say if it was if it was just like
B	yeah you know just somewhere on the outskirts but it's just that little bit too far
A	mm
B	but erm this is it you say to him as an ex-Sun Sun engineer and as an ex-Sun one of the
A	yeah well that sadly is not gonna happen
B	no no
A	but
B	cos he did all the
A	yeah
B	no not the linguistics
A	mm
A	in this rather close erm warm room
A	that sounds like linguistics
B	linguistics that's it it was
A	yeah
B	sort of communicate all he did was do his wires and
A	and he was the guy who did linguistics?
B	yeah but he he did he was kind of researching
A	oh
B	the sort of technicalities of it and writing it down and you know
A	yes
B	programming bits and comparing different things and doing all that sort of stuff I don't know it was a particular part of something was this project and nobody else seemed to work with him now whether it was because he was a bit erm in a hot room or whether nobody else was interested and I think
A	yes
