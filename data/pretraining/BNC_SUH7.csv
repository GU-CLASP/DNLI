A	what do you listen to? do you listen to anyone?
B	erm ah Taylor Swift's like
C	you actually filming it?
B	yeah it is recording now
C	how long's it been recording for?
B	er two minutes now
B	yeah
C	might even cut that out
B	they're not going to like this material okay erm
C	I just wanna say for the record I nearly fell off the table
B	yeah yeah
C	so I I don't swear a lot I just
B	they're they're listening to you right now
A	disclaimership
B	okay erm no no no what
C	I'm not a bad person
B	have you seen the Hobbit trailer
A	the new one?
B	yeah there was a new one like
A	I've not
B	a couple of day ago watch it erm alright
C	should we give our names? should we call ourselves like Mr X or something?
B	er it's just no Mr X
A	John Smith we're all John Smith
B	we're all John Smith
C	oh I
B	that'll be alright actually have you watched Pulp Fiction?
A	I have
B	yes yes three people watched Pulp Fiction
A	yes
B	okay I watched I watched
C	and I like Fight Club
B	I I like I was amazed by Fight Club
C	I was amazed by Pulp Fiction
B	and then I told him to watch Fight Club
C	I told him to watch Pulp Fiction
B	I'm now amazed by Pulp Fiction
A	Pulp Fiction's like
C	I'm now amazed by Fight Club
B	every minute of Pulp Fiction is so well made
C	not not not the parts where there's like random sex scenes and
B	no the thing is no that that all has a secret
A	yeah but it's not
C	yeah what about the rape scene? what is that trying to portray?
B	yeah yeah yeah it's showing eh erm it's okay let me think about this erm the the rape scene was
A	it just seems that people's
B	yeah
A	cos bits of it are just rubbish like
B	I think it it was a
C	you know Tarantino
B	the fact that a mob a mob dealer was getting raped
C	no no the point is you haven't seen Django yet
B	no I haven't seen Django
C	or any like kill Kill Bill and all that
A	Kill Bill's amazing
C	basically
A	yeah yeah
C	oh er erm Inglorious Basterds
B	he's he he's done it best
C	Tarantino's go-to is making ultra-violent movies ultra-violent
B	but in a in but in a better way than say Michael Bay does which is action and women
A	what's an ultra-violent film?
C	like
B	just very violent
C	yeah like
A	oh ultra
B	violent
B	erm no no
A	UV lighting
B	Tarantino I he he tries to put a message across I I
C	he doesn't he doesn't really
B	no okay he does it
C	alright think about Django yeah?
B	but he does it well that's the point
C	have you seen
B	oh no
C	no hang on a second that was a great film
B	oh really?
C	not saying it's a
B	okay okay so so so what's the problem with that if you make good films? and it's the thing with erm
B	yeah yeah yeah Edward Norton and Brad Pitt amazing that really got me into Brad Pitt like
B	you know what I mean
C	no I don't
B	I got deep into Brad Pitt erm okay
B	eh I'll start I'll start again erm what was I going to say? yeah
C	yeah yeah they've taken the wrong message
B	people just are getting the wrong message
C	yeah I know but
B	men should go home
C	but that whole
B	yeah that's true that's true
A	isn't it sort of based it seems like communist revolution type they call the proletariat or call the you know? the chefs and
B	proletariat
C	but yeah
A	all the like they all sort of group together
B	the workers
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	they felt like that as though the system had screwed them over
A	that's fair enough yeah
C	sort of like that's why they blew up the credit card companies
B	oh yeah yeah
C	cos they were sick of er
B	when he tried to blow those up
C	yeah yeah yeah I guess it is revolution style
A	revolutionary type
B	yeah he was saying take back your take back your
A	yeah
B	we just think that oh we need to improve ourselves by becoming hench and becoming ah a Gucci model
C	yeah I I
B	yeah
C	and it gives them a lot of self-confidence but to be honest if you're you know get diabetes or something it was your fault that you have like type two diabetes
B	not all but yeah
C	yeah I know
A	but it sort of like it seems to be sort of it's like how in religion you know you ask for forgiveness from god you sort of
C	yeah yeah
A	it's like scapegoating it's not taking responsibility and you're not improving yourself if you you know say you're finding it hard
C	yeah
C	but everyone has the capacity to improve it's just I guess Fight Club's way of thinking about it is being free
B	but that's why that's why he says
C	I ain't cos even then
B	self-destruction that's what he says
C	no
B	self-destruction is is the root to humanity humanity's success but
C	yeah but even then that's that's a form of self-improvement cos they try and that was that's what he
B	but that that's that's getting
C	erm
B	yeah a different a a a point that a point that me and er
A	yeah
B	trying to be perfect and yet Brad Pitt is pretty much the
C	and he's
B	yeah exactly erm
C	oh yeah well he says that he says that
B	so maybe he's already
C	cos he says like I fight the way you want to I talk the way you want
B	yeah
C	like F asterisk C K the way you want
B	straight to
A	well said
C	keeping it clean here
B	oh right oh
B	exactly yeah
B	I
C	ah yeah it's hilarious but there's always that's like low or high pleasure that's like the lower that no you find it
B	Pulp Fiction made me question things
C	like?
C	yeah it's very hard yeah it's
B	the whole movie's about grunting and like you know
C	shooting people in the face
A	it's just what's it? it's just Mr Tarantino trying to get some what's it you know? catchy lines that everyone will
B	yeah that that is true
A	I think it's
C	I guess
A	I suppose yeah but
C	I you've got to think of the purpose of the writer I mean cos
A	it's like
C	I don't know it eh I don't know the writer but did he write the book wanting to make a profit? or did he just write it just cos he just wanted to write it?
B	who? Palahniuk? for with er Fight Club?
C	yeah
B	eh
C	okay well if it was sending a message then I can understand that slightly more than erm er Pulp Fiction
A	exactly Pulp Fiction is meant to be entertaining
C	yeah Pulp Fiction was meant to be entertaining whereas er er Fight Club was meant to be thought-provoking
B	yeah okay
C	Fight Club was meant to actually make you stop
B	you're you're like comparing two different things but
C	no I know I know that's what
B	yeah that's why we can't but erm
C	obviously there's no definitive answer as to what is a better film but
B	no no it's like everything is objective but erm
C	IMDB says
B	IMDB
B	ruin their career thingy erm er
A	better question is the music in Pulp Fiction good? the music?
C	yeah
B	yeah it's
B	but
B	and the music they talk about erm the
A	what is it? is it?
B	I don't think that anywhere is better but it it it it got to it was such a good song I'll
A	it's like he does like Chuck Berry ah it's incredible music
unknown_female	Chuck Berry
B	yeah I know I know it's like it's like a Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack
C	ah
B	and and the theme behind
C	that's the
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	which one?
C	Guardians of the Galaxy
B	have you watched
A	I've
B	you have to see it it is the best
C	it is I we're yeah well yeah
B	and we both love that it's my favourite Marvel
C	I I I'm confused whether that or erm Days of Future Past I suppose
C	it's the best in that it it's the best in
B	why did that? it was another Wolverine movie it really was all about Wolverine
C	I don't know no no no no it wasn't about that it wasn't
B	it was as much a Wolverine movie as
C	it
B	yeah
C	where he had like he was the he was basically the main character
B	yeah
C	but he
B	yeah exactly
C	but they were they were my favourite parts of the movie
B	okay
C	yeah Quicksilver
B	Quicksilver er you you know they added that right at the end it wasn't actually something that they
A	oh really?
B	yeah and and and and the Quicksilver that's going to be in the Age of
C	age yeah
B	than erm cos you know Age of
C	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	there's there's a they they they're also having Quicksilver but they're not making him a
A	right
B	erm because of rights and and stuff
A	yeah
B	cos Fox owns the rights to Avengers and
C	oh yeah yeah Fox
B	yeah
C	because
B	no no but as in they can't combine them and I I'm just saying they've set the bar so high
C	yeah I know but no but the point is here
B	er yeah
C	yeah cos that cos that Quicksilver was comedy Quicksilver
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	but his
C	yeah I know the
C	you know the part where he runs around?
B	Time in a Bottle Time in a Bottle
D	yeah
B	it's so good it's so good
B	erm yeah
C	and he just runs around and starts flicking stuff and moving guns around
B	physics in that scene was legit as well
B	ah
C	erm okay if you want?
B	no yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	I mean the problem with
C	I mean F equals M A so
A	the problem with
C	his acceleration is awesome
B	yeah no
A	the problem with
C	ah ah because when he moves the arm his acceleration doing that is like like amazingly massive so the mass of that arm times that acceleration is gonna like just decimate the guy's face
B	it's going to
B	and that's a good idea that's what he did
C	no he no no no I mean like it would like punch a hole in his face
A	when he runs
C	it's like that yeah yeah
A	yeah but when he runs how come the the air resistance doesn't rip his skin off like
B	because he wears that those goggles
A	or like er you know?
A	he's a mutant and how don't his clothes shatter to pieces like?
C	or yeah and the floor why didn't the floor crush? when he runs on that
B	okay you know that? the
unknown_female	see you guys
A	see you next week mate yeah
B	see you erm you know that song Time in a Bottle?
A	yeah
B	if he was going at that speed how could they play that song at that
C	well no because time is a time is relative time is relative the faster you go the closer you get to the speed of light the more time slows down
B	cos he
C	so
B	he was
C	so technically yeah yeah
C	no no no no
A	to real people it would sound a lot slower
C	yeah yeah
A	but if he sped if he sped up super quick I think it
B	yeah yeah that's what I'm saying is that what he did?
C	no no no no no it's not that no because time is
B	yeah
C	the er the more time slows down but but relative you to you you won't see a difference cos you know? you around you but everyone else
A	yeah
C	erm will see you going fast you would see everyone else going slow
A	yeah
C	the headphones which are part of him
A	yeah
C	erm because he they're they're moving at the exact same speed as him
A	yeah
C	he hears them at at the exact same speed everyone else hears them slower no faster relative to to him
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's just physics
A	it's messy
B	yeah yeah I I won't understand that
B	that's that's fair enough
A	it's effort
B	no
C	it's like yeah no he didn't need to
B	think think he would
C	no he
B	yes
A	so it's speeding up for him cos he?
C	yeah
A	ah I see I see
C	no what? yeah well yeah
A	that's cool it's pretty cool
C	yeah it's like the classic Einstein thought experiment with the er
A	which one? the
C	the
A	yeah
C	classic isn't it? eh so they both have clocks and the erm like the pendulum of the clock is a photon and it bounced up and down between two plates and that's how you use cos that that never changes that the speed of that photon
A	right
C	erm you you can calculate time precisely right?
A	okay
C	so it's moving up and down and then so you know what the interval is and you can calculate time precisely and he theorised that
C	if he was eh running eh if he was flying near the speed of light? that erm that and he
A	oh right
C	erm it would it would seem cos to to him that photon is moving at the same rate to him himself but to everyone else it's moving that distance hence must be slower so erm the entire world is seemingly slower so so by him moving faster he slows down the world around him but compared to everyone else
A	that's amazing
B	everything speeds up I think you mean? because if it covers that distance it needs to move quickly
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah sorry
B	so yeah yeah yeah okay
A	that's cool
C	yeah that's just like sort of one of his classic thought experiments
A	it's like Schrodinger's cat that's sick and I think I can understand it as well
B	yeah yeah I know
A	that's weird like
B	it's it's a way of thinking
C	yeah it I know the
B	at least the way my brother tried to explain it to me
C	the the pop culture way of thinking of it is just like the cat can be both dead and alive which it can't
A	it's so cool cause okay for the record
B	yeah
A	you have a cat?
B	yeah
A	in a box?
B	in a box yeah
C	there's a fifty percent chance
A	with a some dynamite which has fifty percent chance of blowing up
unknown_female	yeah
A	and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so therefore is the cat dead or alive?
B	yeah
A	before you open the
B	why can't it be both dead and alive?
A	cos it can't
B	it can why not?
A	well it can't
B	like in the sense
C	no no no the whole point
A	through our common sense it cannot but
C	the whole point it was that it yeah I know because the whole point is it's meant to be an allegory for the particle wave duality
A	right right
B	oh
C	yeah so a
A	love the way The Big Bang Theory turns it into into a relationship paradigm
C	yeah
A	by we can be both dating and not dating
A	the way Leonard and Penny did it
C	so so a wave can't be a particle at the same time as it is a wave but given
A	but
C	because
A	cos therefore that implies our thoughts have physical impact
C	no
A	right
C	that can only happen when it's a particle so it must be a particle that's hitting the thing but whereas erm like a when a a a wave erm like reflects a particles can't reflect like that
A	right right
C	so erm it's like it's undefined so the cat is both dead and alive it's it's kind of it's not it doesn't mean that it's both dead and alive at the same time it just means that it's undefined
B	right it means it's neither
C	yeah it's neither
A	yeah yeah
C	so it's a completely undefined as what it is up until the moment that you make it define itself
A	mm undefined is very similar to like how here's a question what's one divided by zero?
C	yeah it's undefined
A	exactly yeah and it's and it's not infinity because if you approach it on a a Y equals one
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but the reason we don't say equals infinity because normally if something approaches something we just say equals that
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but the reason
B	it doesn't it actually never does
A	cos it well it approaches it but and if if it if that was it we'd say it equals infinity
B	yeah
A	but it approaches different numbers depending which way you
B	yeah right yeah
A	if you come from the bottom it approaches minus infinity which is completely different and
B	oh yeah
A	there's some
B	yeah
C	well yeah well
A	therefore it's undefined and it doesn't have a limit like
C	yeah yes
B	oh man
C	I guess that's where where physics starts to make sense when
B	no no it right right right
C	that's like that point
A	I think it's just you hear it so much you start to believe it
B	fair
C	yeah well no I I can kind of get Schrodinger's cat I don't know well obviously
A	why do you
C	we don't get the mechanics of it
A	yeah yeah
C	because you know we we we can't because er by the very nature of trying to understand the mechanics of it you change the mechanics of it
A	yeah
C	yeah that's the
C	I guess feasibly it could be both dead and alive but I don't think that would really from a physics standpoint hold but so it's more likely to by undefined up until that point
A	do you have any idea how we understand what photons are like? cos we obviously we can't see them
C	yeah erm
A	well cos the moment they hit your light they're gone they're eye your eye they're gone
B	oh right yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah eh that's the that's the whole Heisenberg uncertainty theorem isn't it?
C	that you can never know a a position and eh momentum at the same time
B	god damn it
A	yeah it's cool isn't it?
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	the more you
C	yeah and and you can do that with anything so like I think a woman famously tried to get out of a speeding ticket because she used
B	really?
C	cos you can't know my position and my erm my speed that accurately at the same time
B	that's just someone messing that's someone messing with their
C	obviously they still gave her a ticket
B	yeah I know it was like like anyone's going to buy that
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah look just to dumb this conversation down quite a lot is is this is more philosophy
C	yeah yeah sure
B	relating to philosophy is philosophy and talking about er hypothetical stuff pointless in itself
B	or is?
C	that's
B	yeah yeah I know yeah exactly so why spend your life talking about something that is only going to be relative to people?
C	because they they actually have real life applications I mean if you think of a
B	how many people think oh am I going to do this Schrodinger's cat? or this principle? or?
C	no no I know yeah I know I know you think it's completely mental but like you think of a quantum computer
B	yeah
C	oh you you basically people
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	which where you can have
A	I think you eh you give an electron like ten spins at once and you can measure them all at once or something and it
B	yeah sick
A	on a normal bit on a computer
C	that means there's ten electrons yeah
A	but this can be like every number between one and zero at the same time
B	yeah
C	which is defined by its charge erm its eh position its eh energy level
A	yeah yeah
C	and eh its spin
A	and you can measure all of them at once
C	so if it if it has if it has ten different spins that means it's effectively ten different electrons
B	yeah oh right yeah yeah
C	which means that effectively you can do the times the amount of calculations
B	what so like when it's moving it changes its makeup or?
A	I I don't know how it works but
A	you you give it a
B	yeah
A	and you can measure each of them to get different stuff out
C	yeah
B	right right
A	and they reckon it'll be better to make like a brain-type computer
B	yeah
A	because brains work more like that they work you know more complex and you know firing lots of things at once
B	yeah yeah
A	instead of just a linear
B	brain
A	so they reckon like they
B	yeah? really?
A	yeah yeah and it and it's like this big and costs like fifteen million quid yeah?
B	do you think that will advance at the same rate computers have advanced?
A	I think they'll advance faster
B	looks like looks like they are yeah
B	yeah oh that's amazing
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so I'm again changing the subject maybe deliberately erm
A	and it's going to come back to physics again
B	no no yeah we will
C	it's like me and
B	yeah I know erm
C	and what happens in physics? it explodes there we go
A	so what sort of musics do you like?
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	but this this is a genuine conversation
A	we're just
C	and I think they're going to be revelling in it
B	I don't think they care what we talk about
A	it's true we're just effing weird they're not going to want
B	no I know
B	they're not going to listen to everything erm oh no they are though cos they're transcribing it so that's cool
C	well yeah they could be transcribing this
B	they're going to turn everything we say into into er words erm there's seven minutes left of this half an hour recording
A	that's pretty cool
B	erm what was I saying? erm yeah what music do we like? okay erm
A	yeah do you just like
B	cos I think we all completely have complete opposite
unknown_female	your gay face
A	oh my god
B	shut the shut the
C	that's not music
B	okay no not erm I don't like Nicki Minaj er what's that
A	has it got
C	that Ice Cube thing?
B	Lil Wayne Kanye Kanye's Kanye's okay
C	Kanye man Kanye Kanye's awful I just like him cos he's a prick
B	Kanye's
B	when he took when he took the mic
C	it's like excuse me excuse me hi Taylor I have a lot of respect for you
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	but Beyonce made an amazing video this year
C	ah it was
B	it was
C	have you seen erm erm have you seen er Oasis er Liam Gallagher's reaction to that?
A	I know he go on what did he say? there's so many
C	eh he goes erm he goes
B	so many
B	and she was so grateful and cos she's a country singer
A	ah so happy yeah
B	she
C	and everyone just went ah except for Kanye West
B	and she went she was like ah thank you thank you
B	Kanye drunk goes up
C	bursts onto the stage
B	steals the mic she's like what is going on? and he was like
B	that's what he said
B	erm and then he said erm
C	yeah and I think she should have won
B	and he said Beyonce's video was history and then he storms off
B	erm and Taylor Swift doesn't say anything she's just like she's just like standing there and it's ah it's so sad
C	yeah she doesn't know what to do
B	and then he who gets the biggest backlash ever goes to Japan for a year makes no er er you know er
B	erm er news conference whatever you want to call it erm no music he was just he was off for a whole year cos it was just the amount of crap he got
B	he's a prick he's he's a
C	ah yeah douchebag he's
B	I know a Kardashian they're so perfect for each other it's
C	yeah I know
B	ah I'm so happy I'm not ignorant or?
A	I need to like expose myself to more of this gunk like you know? like Kardashians and stuff
B	yeah I know literally I found myself two days ago I was just like oh what is this? and I knew
B	but anyway what was I saying? so I like I'm a big fan of Eminem that's all I'm going to say
C	no ah
A	he's good actually I must be fair
B	I yeah I I
C	my favourite is Will Smith and that's just it
B	yeah yeah yeah Will's ah funny that okay
A	yeah
B	early early two thousands
C	he doesn't swear at all
B	I know
C	in his rap and his rap is just like happiness in a rap
C	that should be a Subway advert
C	you heard it first
B	oh I get it
A	patent
C	I'm patenting that one
B	oh my god
C	transcribe that and send it to me please
B	what happened was if you care? yeah Will Smith criticised erm basically the rap industry for
C	yeah
B	and then then Tupac and Biggie died and then everything just went back to normal Eminem started swearing more and
C	I the rap
B	I just like
C	yeah
B	but yeah the the way he can er conjure rhymes and and then and
A	well
B	it's like
C	well Pitbull's a genius Pitbull's a genius you know why? you know why Pitbull's a genius? he rhymed Kodak with Kodak
B	yeah exactly he could rhyme orange with anything
C	yeah
A	he probably doesn't what's it? even write it does he?
B	no no he he writes his own songs and that's that's not just me
B	he he he he's one of the few erm yeah
A	okay
C	sounds like you're fanboying here
B	trust me I do I I
B	he he he genuinely writes his own his own lyrics the the thing that people do admit are usually stolen are erm they're called sampling of if you listen to any rap song
C	yeah yeah
B	usually the chorus is is it's not stolen it's given permission but it's from a different song like erm like
A	yeah
B	you know? they stole off of erm Aerosmith well they didn't steal it they got permission you know?
A	yeah
B	so that's called sampling there's a big debate about that but generally rappers write their own lyrics though
A	that's cool
B	erm I can see I can see I've hated Eminem at times as well
A	see Eminem like Not Afraid erm you know the Love the Way You Lie he did with?
B	yeah with
A	they were brilliant brilliant songs
A	but
B	erm well at least at least now you know he's had some really awful albums
B	and that he's he admits now for being as awful as you know? in that they're horrible bass lines horrible but pointless lyrics I mean I think there's pros to each album but I mean
A	yeah yeah
B	from the heart yeah
B	okay away from the hip-hop I like erm I got into Linkin Park more
A	okay yeah
B	erm they had their ups and downs as well
A	like when they did Numb and stuff Numb and New Divide they were they were brilliant yeah
B	yeah New Divide erm In the End er what I think that's sort of two thousand and seven onwards two er even later than that
