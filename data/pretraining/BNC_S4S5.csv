A	all the medical people
B	oh okay
A	she's got a dementia nurse
B	has she?
A	who takes her out for coffee
B	sounds like a plan
A	and then she goes to The Dementia Café
B	there's a Dementia Café?
A	yeah there is one over at er the housing association
B	is it called The Memory Café?
A	yeah

B	yeah it says with jam or marmalade I noticed that last week and they didn't put it on
A	yeah I wondered about it last week too
B	yeah
A	marmalade no marmalade and sweet things don't go together
A	they might
B	really?
A	yeah I think Memory Café is nicer
B	yeah so do I
A	but they do things like play old music from whatever era when the people were young
B	oh
A	it's very good because with dementia people will often remember fifty years ago
B	yeah
A	but not what is happening now but not what happened yesterday
B	my erm pilates teacher
A	oh yeah
B	and she was saying that all the research suggests that you shouldn't use old music you should use more modern music so there's no association
A	I agree with them
B	yeah exactly that's what I was thinking and she was saying that's what all the research showed so they do sort of fairly modern
A	yeah great
B	stuff yeah she said there's a few of them around
A	yeah it is hard I think
B	yeah she does all sorts of interesting things
A	she does with her three children
B	I know
A	oh right and then she says in great detail how
B	no I'm sure she'll be going and I'm sure she'll be helping

A	yeah and it was
B	oh really?
A	yeah she's getting on a bit
B	yeah
A	I can't be bothered I get to it and can't be bothered with it all
A	going up
B	yeah
A	it's not cos here it's really kind of quite brash
B	I liked it I went last year last winter with er the some of the mum's actually and it was really nice
A	it's warm
B	yeah
A	they've got two fires one either end of the room cos it used to be like two bars
B	mm
A	and it's really warm we went there for the jazz on Sunday
B	mm oh
A	and took
B	oh I didn't know you went to
A	yeah it was in
B	mm
A	I've been doing jazz research cos only cos I want to do some paintings
B	mm
A	and I was did some really I do you know what scat singing is in jazz?
B	mm mm
A	I do the equivalent of drawing just like really quick one minute two seconds drawings and loads of people were looking at them at
B	oh okay mm yeah
A	and there were all sorts of random people there there was a lady called
B	oh right
A	she lives in
B	oh okay
A	and she's married to
B	oh yeah
A	who is from Zurich and I think he earns lot of money working in Zurich
A	with with
B	erm Eastern European surname
A	Ethiopian?
B	Eastern European
A	I don't know what his
B	what's his surname?
A	I don't know what his surname is
B	I thought we talked about him?
A	I don't know what his surname is
B	on no that was with
A	yeah that's with
B	I know yeah
B	okay
A	and
B	mm
A	was there with her mum
B	mm
A	she's taken her mum and
B	mm
A	I said oh it'll be in ten years' time she said no she wouldn't be here by then
B	is she an artist?
A	I don't know no idea
B	yeah I do wonder
A	I've never met her before I don't think so but she was looking she said you do it so quickly
A	so that was quite nice
B	mm
A	and talked to
B	mm
A	who is very handsome
B	okay
A	he's really nice looking
B	mm
A	he looks like
A	yeah yeah he was talking about
B	mm
A	and how they'd been climbing and that
B	he does at the moment
A	I said it's the Andes air
B	she's not looking closely enough at the moment
A	it's the Andes air but his mum looks very youthful they all look quite young don't they?
B	mm mm
A	she's not she must be about fifty
B	yeah she is yeah
A	that's not young
B	maybe she's not fifty yet actually
A	so it was quite an entertaining evening and then
B	what on Sunday?
B	really? no
A	when the jazz was going on
B	what were they doing there? were they lost?
A	they were staying overnight cos they're homeless
B	god did they have to move round?
A	yeah they've been homeless for about ten days
B	yeah I know that
A	well they don't call themselves homeless they think they're on holiday cos they don't have to do any washing up
B	mm
A	but they move around from hotel to hotel and they were staying at
B	by choice?
A	by default because they've signed off on one house and the other house hasn't come through
B	how funny
A	and so they've sold their house and will have massive amounts of money in the bank erm but they're waiting for the other house to come through
B	mm
A	I don't know I get a bit bored with houses
B	ah that's funny
A	so there was
B	I bet they were surprised to see you
A	they were
B	I bet she was
A	she was obviously meant to see me cos we were trying to go to
B	yeah
A	so they had their little dog little pug dog upstairs in the bedroom in a cage
B	oh god
A	and they sat downstairs and they had a meal while
B	yeah
A	from all over the world and then we joined them and er listened to the music oh
B	and?
A	you'll never guess what?
B	what?
B	yeah I'm not surprised
A	I keep saying you know she's got a hidden past but I'm sure her kids don't
B	yeah big time they've got no idea
A	yeah
B	so yeah it's all a bit hypocritical I should imagine
A	it's all a bit what?
B	hypocritical from
A	mm
B	no I don't want any more thanks what?
A	okay I thought you wanted some jam?
B	I did I had it on the other one
A	oh okay
B	what did she say?
A	what what I couldn't work out it looked sort of Indian S N double O K G H no S K double O N G H
B	yeah could be a bit Indian I don't know
A	she's very good but they all thought she's very controlled you see
A	and I took some pictures of the pianist who we'd seen last week with another singer
B	mm
A	he was with
A	yeah it was very entertaining oh yeah
B	yeah I understood what?
B	what?
A	only once only once on stage
B	how what?
A	I don't know
B	that is bonkers
A	yeah bonkers
B	didn't you ask any more?
A	no
B	why not?
A	if you ask people questions they stop telling you giving you information
B	oh okay
A	haven't you noticed that with
B	yeah but that's the sort of thing that warrants at least one question
A	no
B	that really?
A	I know I thought it was funny
B	that is that is odd
A	only once I think it was a bit like
B	oh okay
A	I think it was probably a
B	pulled out of the audience kind of thing
A	but she used to sing there was a folk group called the Spinners and she used to sing with them
B	that's really funny
A	I know all this hidden past coming out
B	I know I think I used to tell people like
A	oh don't don't tell
B	no I didn't I don't any more cos
A	mm that's true
B	yeah that is a massive give away
A	I think it was just an on stage thing with Meat Loaf I don't know but
B	no but she used to sing in a folk group
A	there's such a
B	how funny
A	I never knew she sang before
B	no but then I suppose if she was drama and all of that
A	she wasn't she was art visual
B	well yeah visual art really?
A	mm yeah
B	again very well hidden
A	yeah and then
B	what? what was he talking about?
B	yeah
A	and as an adult he went back and he was working in the bush on top secret things and you weren't allowed to take photographs well
A	real men don't have mirrors don't you know
B	okay
A	it's not real men moisturise real men don't have mirrors
B	no
A	and so he went on holiday to the Seychelles
B	yeah
A	and he took some photographs and then he had them developed and there was a photograph of him in front of a plane
B	mm
A	and he he just deduced that must be what he looked like
A	from the photograph
B	how odd
A	I thought it was very Jungle Book you know animals looking in ponds and seeing their reflection
A	I didn't quite get it but
B	no
A	it was an interesting tale
A	they are they're very close to each other
B	yeah yeah they're both a bit bit loopy
A	mm and now they've got this itinerant lifestyle passed on
A	I think they're getting a bit tired of it and then from today they're going over to look after dogs in
B	oh yeah
A	they're going off to Australia
B	mm
A	for
B	okay mm
A	so at least they'll be in one place
B	where is their new house?
A	they haven't got it yet
B	where is it supposed to be?
A	but it will be in
B	oh
A	mm
B	mm
A	at the far end by the cookery store
B	I don't know where that is
A	you go through the main high street passed the hospital and just keep going
B	okay
A	and it's sort of the far end by
B	okay okay
A	if they get it they may chose to buy another one
B	yeah
A	but I don't think
B	but they did before they used to come down all the time
A	mm but they don't now
B	well that's probably better for everyone
A	I think they need them now
B	yeah but they had them so much before when they didn't want them kind of you know
A	yeah dunno anyway they'll be in
B	okay
A	they won't be homeless at least
B	mm
A	very entertaining weekend though
B	maybe they'll bump into
A	oh mm they might well they should be
B	yeah they might
A	well they should be yeah they might indeed everyone goes to the Co-op don't they?
B	yeah that erm none of them are like that
B	mm
A	we're going there tonight
B	I know
A	for the orchard Christmas dinner
B	mm
A	but I'm surrounded by eccentric people
B	yeah they all a bit weird
A	yeah
B	and
A	no no well everybody is a bit weird
B	no
A	she had to address a letter to who used to be the lord lieutenant of Devon and who is now being knighted as sir so and so and how did she address his his wife?
A	who is called
B	you just have to google it surely?
A	she doesn't have internet
B	no that's
A	and I wasn't going to I was in the middle I was just about to start painting and didn't offer you can look it up in any dictionary actually but
B	oh yeah
A	I didn't offer then to research but so she worked it out for herself
A	I thought I'm the most plebeian person why ask me?
B	oh yeah definitely
A	but I didn't say that
B	that's really funny
A	ah and yeah she was very nice actually but her poor little cat she'd had to take her cat to the vet that morning
B	mm
A	and so she rang
B	nice that cat yep
A	you couldn't make it up could you?
B	no
A	and then they took her to the vets
B	mm
A	and the poor little thing couldn't breathe poor little cat couldn't breathe
B	mm
A	the vet thinks it might have had some poisoning
B	oh gosh
A	well everyone puts down like mouse poison or rat poison
B	mm
A	and if she's eaten a mouse that's eaten poison I don't know
B	oh yeah that's true
A	but I must ring her and find out what happened to her little cat
B	well that's very good of
A	yes that's what
A	so that was really sweet
B	mm
A	so I told her about the erm the er bird down the chimney
B	oh yeah
A	coming down into the wood burning stove
B	it seemed very unscathed the bird just blew off out the window
A	I know well birds are bizarre
B	yeah
A	at least you can get hold of it and
B	yeah I don't know what
A	oh I showed him what to do
B	oh okay
A	you take the top plate off
B	oh
A	cos I might ask have to ask you soon
B	oh no
A	take the top plate off and then you have a cloth and you put your hands in wrap the cloth round the bird
B	yeah
A	take it out and then that's
B	well it's probably easier than bats that we used to get in Ecuador
A	bats?
B	yeah once we had I you know where
A	er
B	it looked like something out of a vampire movie
A	wow
B	yeah but
A	wow
B	yeah they were really horrible
A	well they quite often carry disease
B	yep er we were cos we were so high up we were like on the fourth floor
A	when we stayed yeah when we stayed at the beach there were bats outside your beach hut
B	yeah but they were quite small and they were just flying around they weren't perched inside your house like in like in
A	really?
B	yeah er
A	oh wow
B	just hanging upside down asleep it blended in very well
A	that does sound horrible
B	yeah I don't know how it got in actually no idea but yeah we were quite high up
A	apparently
B	mm
A	and they ran out of money of course she did an ecology course and she became qualified so she could go round and erm identify where there's bats in buildings
B	oh wow
A	which is what
B	oh okay
A	that's his job he's employed by
B	yeah
A	cos they're a protected species
B	oh okay
A	cos nobody wants these bats in their belfry's kind of thing
B	yeah
A	and she'd go round but what she didn't like was telling people that they had bats and they couldn't build
B	yeah
A	so she's now working in a dental hospital in
B	oh
A	which is a nice safe way for her to earn some money before they go off on their next erm crazy adventure
B	I wonder where they'll go they haven't got Africa maybe they haven't got many places left to go have they? they've been quite a lot of places
A	mm I don't know
B	how funny
A	so opposite to her sister
B	I know and the rest of them actually
A	yeah
B	I think it's cos
A	didn't they have a
B	some interesting cousins?
A	no
B	oh
A	no I think they've bought them up so ordinary that's why
B	oh yeah definitely
A	but they're both a bit bonkers
B	I don't think
B	I don't know I don't think what
B	she'll stop soon how old is she?
A	she's only twenty-five
B	yeah there you go she is still she's only twenty-five she's got at least another five years
A	I think
B	yeah probably but she got her degree and everything like that didn't she? so it's not like she's gone off the rails without getting any qualifications
A	oh she's not off the rails she's just very adventurous
B	yeah it sounds great
A	mm
B	don't blame her
A	and
B	oh yeah
A	with little
B	I know
A	really energetic
B	yeah
A	so they were quite happy I said right there's this this and this and we need to get some sheets we'll put it round the base of the tree
B	yeah
A	and I said but watch the baby and don't let you know baby was on
B	okay
A	and
B	yeah
A	and what is nice is this lady called
B	okay
A	erm and
B	oh dear
A	I said it came from
B	yeah oh okay
A	but apparently
B	okay
A	so it's a running buggy
B	yeah you can get them
A	mm well she's got one
B	yeah
A	she said she went running for the first time without the buggy and it was strange because you were at a different angle
B	yeah
A	very energetic
B	running for
B	yeah very energetic she'll be wanting to go back to work soon then?
A	yeah well it's I think she's due back to go in January
B	yeah sounds like she wants to it's about time to go back
A	well baby is only nine months I think it's a year
B	it depends
A	well she gave up this time last year
B	oh okay
A	and she almost went back in October but she got more maternity leave
B	yeah
A	but she is tremendously energetic
B	yeah
A	and
B	oh dear
A	as well so yeah apparently she went off to the Lake District to with
B	oh wow
A	a Canadian canoe
B	oh cool
A	she knows
B	oh okay he doesn't know her though
A	she said everybody knows
B	yeah yeah they do
A	and she said all her friends really like him
A	mm
B	erm for a kayaker he sounds like he's very patient
A	oh are they not usually patient?
B	well no when he talk when he talks about
A	oh really
B	whereas
A	yeah that's very military actually
B	yeah exactly what do you mean you can't do it? why not?
B	so yeah I think he's very yeah very patient
A	when are you going?
B	I don't know
A	is it something you want to do?
B	I don't want to do white water kayaking no
A	mm mm
B	not not even slightly no erm I don't know I quite fancy a nice gentle open Canadian canoe on flat water
A	you and
B	I'm not
A	mm
B	I'm not that bothered I don't really want to go white water kayaking down the
A	no no you don't have to
B	no I don't
A	cos
B	well I'm not that's not I'm not like him
A	cos
A	yeah but you remember you have muscle memory and you
B	yeah but a river is not the same
A	and instincts
B	mm
A	the river just took him
B	mm yeah no I maybe a bit of sea kayaking maybe in Ecuador? I don't know
A	yeah I think you'd like sea kayaking
B	maybe yeah
A	it's about time you did something adventurous
B	yeah I suppose
A	yeah you can come to the gym with me
B	that's not very adventurous
A	it depends what you do when you get there can be
B	I don't know
A	can be
B	I'd quite like a bike
A	it's adventurous for your body
B	I'd quite like a bike
A	would you?
B	yeah I think that would be quite nice
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	don't know talk to
B	yeah he's usually got them coming out of his ears hasn't he?
A	I was thinking those people have bought L plates
B	why?
A	so so he can drive their car
A	he's got one pair that he takes with him everywhere
B	oh yeah he hasn't got any so yeah they must have done
B	that's really funny yeah he's on about three different it's on
A	oh wow that's quite that's good experience though to be driving the van
B	yeah
A	unless
B	it's not great for his driving test practice because there's no rear view mirror you just have to use your side mirrors
A	that's very good
B	so it's not brilliant but yeah
A	not a driving test
B	not driving test practice
A	he knows his driving test practice is
B	yeah and he's on
A	oh right
B	and
B	yeah so no
A	that's good you can get keep your car
B	it'll be good yeah yeah
A	that's the main thing you get to keep your car
B	yeah oh oh I know what the deal was the deal with
B	so there we go that's all sorted
A	for what for the driving? or
B	for the car
A	that's an awful lots of canoeing lessons
B	well that's alright one a week will be fine
B	so yeah that was quite entertaining they're all very keen for him to drive
A	sounds like it there's this whole army of people
B	I know it's funny
A	just you and
B	no I do
A	yeah but you haven't been in the car when he's been driving
B	no
A	no that's what I mean you don't know
B	no no I don't think I will do until he passes his test actually
A	yeah
B	although it might be quite nice to go I'm sure this won't happen but probably quite good for me to go in the back of the car when he's driving someone else's car and just sit in the back while he's driving without really getting involved
B	I think that's probably quite a good idea
A	er I don't think that's going to happen
B	so I can get used to it no I don't think it's going to happen but I think well it's not good for anybody else other than me is it? I think it would good for me
A	not going to be good for him
B	no but you know it'd be good for me
A	well
B	to then be able to get in a car with him
B	yeah
A	oh well we'll see
B	yeah
A	oh I've got to go and get my photographs developed I went up to
B	oh yeah
A	and took cos I'm in the middle of doing this painting and I need another statue so I've got the kind of Henry Moore's Reclining Lady
B	yeah
A	but I needed a kind of something to break up the line between the
B	oh yeah
A	the statue? and and both of them are kind of half naked
B	yes
A	which is quite entertaining
B	mm
A	so I've put the pictures in and I have to go and pick up Flora
B	ah I quite want to do a
B	yeah
A	are buried in
B	in Flora?
A	mm cos she had to go away a few years ago cos the squirrels had been eating her knees
A	yeah cos she's got horrible feet now yeah cos its lead or something
B	oh why would squirrels want to eat lead?
A	I don't know maybe it was something else but anyway she's got horrible feet she's got new lead feet
B	ah
A	which is a bit Biblical isn't it? the prophets always had feet of lead
B	how odd
A	everything is very odd these days
B	yeah yeah
A	I think I'd better go to
A	everything is just a bit strange well I need to go somewhere ordinary maybe I should go and see
B	erm let's go I need we need I need to get
A	oh that's never ordinary
B	why it's
A	yeah I will I'll come at some point
