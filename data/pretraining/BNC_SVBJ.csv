A	so what what was the first film about?
B	well the first well I've got two there's two films
B	which was as would suggest a Birmingham based romantic comedy
B	called Lip Sync
A	uh huh
B	cos it was part partly musical well the characters burst into song for no reason every so often
A	it wasn't about erm
B	danced down New Street
A	it wasn't about two bloke friends cos then it could've been a Brum  a Brum
B	A brum a brom a broman
A	A brum bromoman
B	well actually the two it is a male female leads you know the
A	uh
B	one's a Blues fan
A	oh
B	so there's a romance there
A	it's like Romeo and Juliet
B	you've got to have a romance in every film these days you know
A	mm mm?
B	do you remember the Hammer House Of Horror?
A	uh-huh
B	they've reformed and they did Woman In Black recently
A	uh-huh
B	with Daniel Radcliffe
A	ooh
B	crimson Moon
A	vampires are all the rage nowadays aren't they
B	they have never had
A	mm
B	they've always been popular but it's a bit of overkill possibly at the moment so we'll see what happens
B	the thing with these though is they can always be changed into another creature quite easily you know
B	erm and that's er er yes so subsequently I was I've been interviewed a lot by Nick Owen at the Bedwood Mill
B	er er I met him today
A	ooh
B	and er and so on and so forth
B	being in television you know
B	so
A	oh right
B	er documentary and current affairs now
B	yeah I've got a small production company now
A	oh okay
B	which we sort of dip into every so often but a lot of the work recently has been freelance away from my my business partner
A	mm
B	and er so I've interviewed some interesting people
B	asking the questions
A	uh-huh
B	and then to be the person being interviewed and you're you're trying to work out what they're gonna ask you next and all this sort of thing
B	and it's quite an interesting
A	mm mm
B	Katy Price I've interviewed a couple of times now
B	and er
A	luckily yes I don't actually know these
B	jordon
A	oh
B	you know Jordon
A	orange
B	yes
A	er hair yeah
B	yes very orange
A	okay
B	and these were in the days
A	uh-huh
B	and it was round the early early early to yeah it was probably early er two thousands
A	mm mm
B	culture was all about
B	and she was awful
B	and she was really nice
B	she was all covered up
A	uh-huh
B	and then
A	stepped into a telephone box and came out
B	I'll be another hour
B	it took her an hour to walk round it
A	mm
B	er the tan looked very orange and erm and the make-up was just dreadful
A	mm mm
B	and she just became this other person
A	mm mm
B	to suddenly morphing into this caricature
A	did her personality change as well?
B	er er well I didn't speak to her enough as Katy Price to
A	mm
B	to know that to be honest but yeah that was an interesting experience
A	ah-huh
B	light entertainment and sport
A	oh okay
B	so the sport took me to Rugby Special and Football Italia
A	uh-huh
B	and things like that
B	great because er because er I was interviewing Martin Johnson you might have heard of the England er former England captain
A	uh-huh
B	er Lawrence Dallaglio
A	mm mm
B	and then footballers as well
B	it was a fascinating world you know
B	so I'm very lucky to be able to name drop cos otherwise
A	super
B	so heavily and er
A	yeah
B	much like yourself
A	er a
B	yeah
A	manny's at Wembley this weekend filming
B	oh right
A	something and he put it up on his Facebook page yesterday saying look what I'm doing
A	I'm recording this dedelededede sound check and oh I'm just standing here and thinking
B	oh it's a band is it?
A	yeah
B	I wonder what's on the
A	asian
B	yeah Kalil
A	mm mm
B	even just for a year or something
A	music
B	one is music
A	oh yeah
B	I would have liked to have done some David Attenborough type of things
B	although it's incredibly boring apparently
B	on the real edge
A	get David Bellamy and get right in there
B	so so it's what I was saying before I I I've actually been interviewed a lot recently
A	mm mm
B	even on  today and you you know I'm sort of God what do I
B	I really
A	uh-huh
B	I was on Tom Ross' show which is BR and B
A	mm mm
B	and he erm and the first thing I said was he said so you're a Birmingham City fan
B	and and and and he laughed
A	uh-huh
B	but when you've got a camera
A	yeah
B	which I've done to people all my life
A	mm mm
B	it's a really different experience
A	why is it cos it's daunting?
B	yeah
A	the fact that you're visually?
B	no it's not daunting
A	is it my best side?
B	yeah it is
B	er you know I haven't got much to work with but erm
B	what did I eat before? Wait have I done this? Have I? And then you're conscious of what you're doing as well
A	mm
B	are you waving your hands and
A	mm
B	and are you
A	mm
B	being interviewed standing and suddenly
A	uh-huh
B	on your face and possibly shoulders
B	and this for the microphone is me waving my hands around gesticulating
A	mm mm
B	that's that's the thing
A	it is very
B	when the tables are turned
A	mm
B	yes
A	there's no hidden camera anywhere
B	it's erm
A	I was reading an interesting article the other day
B	yep?
A	about how the the lines between radio and TV are being blurred because like in a lot of radio stations they'll be erm webcasting
B	yes that's right yeah
A	a visual of the programme being made
B	yeah I can think of nothing more tedious
A	ha
B	why would people want to go onto a website and watch people sitting across a table talking
B	you know it's it's not the most visual of of
A	it's not
B	erm er but you know it's part of the interactive thing I suppose
A	yeah
B	which is all the the you know which is the future I guess of television radio whatever
A	mm
B	but television has been dumbed down an awful lot
B	I do I've done a lot of tonight programmes on ITV which
A	mm that's
B	for ITV is is still they're still well made
A	mm mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	is just cheaper now
A	yep
B	you've got to get to the story quickly
A	mm
B	blame the X Factor and programmes like that
A	I agree
B	well it's almost dictating culture now
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's so I find it wrong because the X Factor for example I know  I know  I've met a lot of musicians
A	mm
B	but obviously a lot of them have been struggling for years and it is a great way for them to get onto telly onto television where they wouldn't be able to usually
A	mm mm
B	but there's a lot of there there it seems to encourage the fact that all you have to do is get up and sing a song in tune
A	mm
B	all be it
A	yeah
B	in the edit process and even live they've been actually
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	whether they can sing or not
A	yeah yeah
B	songs albums you know and actually creating fans
A	mm
B	through your own voice
A	mm mm
B	but whereas someone like Take That who Gary Barlow ironically was on X Factor
B	it was a manufactured band but God they were talented er within their
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know collectively and er individually
A	also the whole thing about celebrity er nowadays isn't it than as in you're not  you're not  revered if you've got talent
B	you don't have to have a talent to be revered and that's that's exactly it yeah
A	that's er I think that's the problem with nowadays like celebrity and music and
B	yeah
A	the whole media agenda
B	well what I find
A	but obviously it's being that it's been dictated by policies coming down from above by fat cats at the top who want
B	well it is
A	to control what people are
B	Simon Cowell makes a very very good living from from all this
A	oh he makes me cringe
B	well it's all about
B	he sizes people up and bang they're gone within three months after that
A	mm
B	some
A	hmm
B	Will Young of course has done very well
A	mm
B	um Alexandra Alexander Berk
A	I don't know I was er
B	yeah you are
A	I've missed the past fourteen years of
B	be very thankful
A	culture
B	er but I yeah I I really despair at the fact that also the the audience have become almost Americanised as well
A	mm
B	so whether you they get up and so somebody stands up and sings a dreadful song
A	mm
B	screaming from all the  all the  fans as it were
B	whether it's good bad or indifferent so it's just the fact that if you get on stand up and you're on television you're a celebrity
A	yep yep
B	oh my God you must be wonderful
A	but do you not think that there's that in a way there's you know a positive effect from that? In that the backlash against well the backlash that's taken place because of the manufactured
B	mm
A	the easiness of manufacturing
B	yeah
A	hits and profits as opposed to actually er promoting real talent
B	well it it's
A	Cos that's that came about in the er er the the time where er social networking was really taking off and lots of people actually made their
B	yeah the famous one was erm Rage Against The Machine
A	mm mm
B	and there was this big Facebook I think er campaign
A	oh that's right abouts yeah
B	to get this one song
B	this song which it must have been about fifteen years old and it was I can't remember what the song was called now but it was something very appropriate to the situation
B	and er you know Don't Feed The Machine or or er er I don't know what it was
A	mm mm
B	and it was
A	mm
B	but that was just a small individual you know
A	yes
B	unfortunately what I worry about is my are my nieces and the like all my kid's
A	mm mm
B	thinking this is normal
A	mm
B	so what you grow up with is normal
B	to my parents it was huh Scalelectrics? How does that work? Er whereas you know now there are iPads and whatever but also that celebrity is just being on television
A	mm mm
B	it doesn't matter what you can do or can't do
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's like even the pop music from from my day it was er
B	oh yeah
A	genius in them that but nowadays
B	but there's still musical genius around
A	yeah but it's not getting pumped through the airways
B	there's lots of it
A	mm
B	and and and that you don't get the bands that are actually writing songs
A	mm
B	probably would be creating new movements as well
A	mm mm
B	which is what how music always generates
A	yep yep
B	you know punk came about because of
A	yeah that's true actually
B	progressive rock and all that
A	yeah
B	and then from punk came scar and
A	mm mm
B	two-toned and er the new wave and then as a rebellion to that came er new romanticism
A	mm
B	came er house er well erm garage and and acid
A	hmm mm
B	and so on and so forth
A	mm mm
B	and it was
A	evolution
B	now we're stuck at cover versions
A	yeah
B	by X Factor people
A	mm
B	or you've got the jangly Brit pop bands which came about and there are too many of those as well
A	mm mm
B	which maybe is just waiting to happen as a as I say as a
A	mm
B	backlash to to the Cowell era
B	and I hope it does you know cos there's always you know even when we were growing up there were boy bands girl bands manufactured music and and culture generally
A	yeah yep
B	I find it really sad
B	and I'm proud of that
A	Don't worry
B	really?
A	in one sense while above
B	wow
A	there in their little playgrounds
B	yeah well
A	and they're er trying to orchestrate
B	there's a classic example of say I I I I totally agree in one respect cos I what I've noticed is er well Blair I suppose Blair and Brown's children
A	mm mm
B	are now the people who are you know they're the thirteen fourteen year-olds whatever
A	mm
B	who erm want work experience all of that type of thing
A	yeah
B	whereas over the Labour years
B	erm was that oh my God you know cos education education education
A	mm
B	oh yeah and of cause they were just bringing down the levels
A	yep
B	they were stopping the great the the the high flyers as if well in terms of education
A	mm mm
B	and that's what I find now with Britain is that there is this level
A	mm
B	where whether it be erm the press or erm or what could be told in the press
A	mm mm
B	television
A	yep definitely
B	everything er reflects the weather here
B	and it seems to have been a deliberate thing because when I grew up there was distinctly an upper class middle class lower class
A	mm
B	working class
A	mm mm
B	the the the people with photographic memories
A	mm mm
B	and geniuses
A	yeah
B	that way
A	mm mm
B	not not in a you know erm Nazi sort of way
B	there's this there's one word
A	but no yeah I can see what you mean
B	but
A	I mean you have aspirations
B	yeah
A	that are set out according to your not your station in life but your
B	not cos you
A	mm
B	and when I was there there wasn't university didn't cost so much
A	yep
B	so whether you came from a working-class background a middle-class upper class you still had pretty much the same opportunities
A	mm mm
B	let's be honest it wasn't as clear cut as that but you you you could aspire and you could get you know the American dream almost
A	mm mm
B	you know that's what we all
A	yeah
B	this entire
B	you can tell I'm a writer
B	er ha erm
A	mm mm
B	erm quite simple people to be honest
A	yeah
B	it's an awful thing to say
B	and the British public being sheep for the most part have just bought into it
A	yep
B	er er isn't it great watching someone do a cover version very badly
A	yeah but it gets more sinister than that when you find out that Michael Gove used to be erm the henchman of er Rupert Murdock
B	yeah
A	and that they are in cahoots what I think
B	leveson Inquiry and that yeah
A	and everything that erm preceded that
B	oh
A	using erm the the whole archive of The Daily Mail and all the
B	oh my God
A	those kind of erm papers that obviously Rupert Murdock
B	mm
A	was gonna charge a pretty penny for
B	oh my word
A	Michael Gove
B	under Cameron of course yes
A	since Gove has been education secretary
B	of course yes
A	it's dodgy as  dodgy as  hell though really isn't it
B	I've always I I've there's one or two conspiracy good old-fashioned conspiracy theories that I love
A	mm
B	the moon landings for example
B	I'm
B	no way
A	it does
B	sometimes
A	the yeah Bush engineered nine eleven
B	that's a good one yeah
A	oh Bin Ladens?
B	oh Bin Ladens sorry
A	Osama Obama
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	and erm actually there are a lot of echoes though between the moon landings and whatever you know
A	mm mm
B	back in sixty-nine of course a losing  a losing  war in Vietnam
A	yep
B	everyone was completely against that
A	mm mm
B	that had been assassinated a few years
B	of course there was the Cold War and everything else and the Russians were beating them
A	uh-huh
B	and then suddenly these three men went into
B	went through space
A	mm mm
B	ha er it's not Van Demon but it's something like that Van something rays
A	uh-huh
B	that come out of
A	mm
B	in a tin can
B	er and none of them had any radiation poisoning
A	okay
B	and they didn't even er they weren't even sick
A	uh-huh
B	er and then there's the faking
A	there's a film about that isn't that the film about the
B	there's lots actually
A	that's it
B	Capricorn Twelve
A	mm mm
B	and erm and then there's there's a lot of proven erm a lot of the photographs were proven to be fake
A	okay
B	there's too many light sources
A	uh-huh
B	now that you know opens up questions of why why were they faked? A if the
A	mm mm
B	it's something incredible
A	mm mm
B	on its own
A	mm
B	film would either melt or or or disintegrate
A	right
B	in the intense cold
A	uh-huh
B	so and then I think it was Hasselblad supplied the cameras which were basically on just
A	mm mm
B	attached to the chest of the space suits
A	yeah yeah
B	beautifully posed
A	uh-huh
B	the er light readings are just perfect
A	smile
B	yeah and they all came out brilliantly
A	mm mm
B	in all the marketing and any anything they put out to the public you know share erm share issues or whatever it is they don't mention the moon
A	mm
B	which is just the most astonishing thing
A	yeah
B	I think Kodak had a bit of that as well
A	mm mm
B	you know Hasselblad
A	well on the moon?
B	yeah
B	we were the  we were the  we took the pictures on the moon
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	we were the
A	especially in that era because it was all about
B	well ever since
A	advertising
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	they don't go overboard with it which you just think you'd be shouting from the roof tops then
A	mm
B	so er and the the anomalies the the whistle blowing which is supposed to have happened is fascinating to me
A	mm mm
B	which most
A	uh-huh
B	you know just that's tough
A	uh-huh
B	so you know they might have landed on the moon but they faked the photographs
A	okay
B	but I do believe they didn't do any of that
A	was there moving film footage as well?
B	yes of later
A	oh okay
B	the side of the er or the
A	mm mm
B	er landing craft
A	mm mm
B	there's no question about that
A	mm mm
B	where you get the cross on on a lens
A	mm mm
B	and in those days for some reason they're not on the moon landing shots had that
A	ah
B	that's supposedly two hundred yards in front
A	uh-huh
B	little cos
A	wasn't there something random in a something very strange in a reflection of the helmet visor or something?
B	yeah well there's endless ones yeah
A	really?
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	light
A	mm
B	and it's so reflective
B	that's what it should be but unfortunately it's got two or three light sources
B	and also shadows as well don't make sense
B	I love it
A	mm
B	and rather like the twenty er the the two thousand and one conspiracies
A	mm mm
B	the American government have been known to lire in the past
A	yep
B	for political gain
A	was that like in the race against Russia to be the best at everything?
B	that was all part of it as well
A	and yeah
B	yeah they beat Russia supposedly
A	mm mm
B	the moon is the nearest thing to us and yet they
A	mm
B	er any of the crafts that landed
A	mm mm
B	they're all in sight
A	mm
B	you know which is just the most bizarre thing
A	uh-huh
B	if they can see er  if they can see er  er a a crater on the moon
A	mm mm
B	that's the size of this building they can see the craft within it
A	mm mm
B	how well scripted that was you know
A	yeah
B	but the American public were really losing interest in um and and subsequently the government
A	uh-huh
B	were losing interest in erm well the finances behind the
A	mm mm
B	Cos they you know they supposedly wanted
A	okay
B	slung sling shot round and came back
A	ah
B	and that won the public back onto the side of the space race
A	politically motivated yeah
B	yeah
A	it could be but
B	for me
A	uh-huh
B	and that's what convinced me
A	mm mm
B	you know what a lie that would be
B	they did not land
B	and I'm convinced to this day so when you mentioned conspiracy theories it's you've got mine
A	relief
B	but they but there are
A	yeah
B	there's gotta be truth in some conspiracy
A	definitely
B	you know people have conspiracy theories about everything
A	mm mm
B	you know with a political agenda
A	you could believe anything though
B	oh yeah
A	that happens
B	yeah
A	as far as I could throw them
B	well we know that the you know a lot of er er
A	what I find interesting is it Hugo Chávez
B	Hugo Chávez
A	is it the Venezuelan president?
B	okay
A	he's saying that isn't it funny how all the Latin American presidents over the past twenty years have died of cancer
B	mm
A	or are dying of cancer
B	uh-huh
A	who have er managed to manufacture some kind of
B	really?
A	cancer inducing substance
A	and that obviously they have given to all of us
B	blimey
A	yes
B	er I'm
A	mm
B	and of the course the the the there are just to many people on this planet now
A	Culling
B	yeah there was yeah
A	mm
B	so all the governments about
A	mm
B	er and that isn't being eliminated either
A	mm mm
B	Korea by by the west
A	ah
B	erm Afghanistan who have been at war with us annoyingly and America for the last ten years
A	mm mm
B	twelve or eleven years have er that was mostly er they were funded by American and by us you know
A	yeah the er the Taliban were trained by the CIA weren't they
B	yes
A	ah so your your end game there is that you reckon that they're trying to get rid of a lot of people so then there's not gonna be so much war for resources
B	for cancer
A	right
B	well isn't it we we we manage to cure everything else pretty much but not cancer which is
A	mm
B	er yeah
A	they didn't Steve Jobs though
B	yeah possibly
B	but no I  but no I  think I I'm agreeing with you
A	mm
B	out there that they er there is something that they er there's just something to it because they do  they do  protect the
A	mm
B	but I think like with the possibility of UFOs and all that
B	because we are
A	yep
B	end of
A	I agree
B	you know so there has to be another planet ninety-two million miles from its sun that can sustain life
A	I agree
B	mm
A	and the creation
B	yes
A	thing
B	yeah
A	life can't exist on another planet but that can happen?
B	yeah
A	it just doesn't seem
B	no
A	no I agree
B	it's just ridiculous really when you
A	mm mm
B	if you do believe in aliens
B	I think there's something
A	mm mm
B	whether it er whether they can fly here and buzz people and never actually make contact to the people that really matter
B	and and anally probe and then you know I go out I I I I go out
B	er why didn't they come and speak to er to Cameron or to Obama or somebody like that or you know get a news conference going?
A	yeah
B	if they really want to make contact
A	maybe cos they're intelligent
B	maybe they don't want to know at this
A	they're like what
B	they'll just er kill themselves off in a few minutes
A	yeah exactly
B	but there are major ones
A	A lot  a lot  of the the purveyors of conspiracy theories I think they do grasp at straws
B	well I've seen documentaries
A	mm
B	and you get that
A	yeah yeah
B	the same type of person talking about these conspiracies
A	uh-huh
B	and that's what shocked me about the moon landing one and the Dark Moon book
A	uh-huh
B	Cos it was so well researched and
A	right
B	and they spoke the it it it was all it all makes sense
A	mm mm
B	well that could have happened you know
A	mm
B	yeah so
B	but there are question marks over what happened and why it happened and
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	that it's human nature that comes into it
A	no no no no
B	was that there was er that when they were building the crafts
A	uh-huh
B	to start with and going through all the research process not one company had it
A	uh-huh
B	another
A	uh-huh
B	the bracket that it goes into and all that sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	it doesn't work
B	erm
A	yeah didn't you say there were some whistle-blowers as well?
B	and they disappeared
A	mm mm
B	the er you know the dictators
A	right
B	erm and sure enough there were a number of people who died on a lonely road in the desert
A	mm
B	car crash
A	mm
B	who were high top scientists
A	mm
B	it was just too much
B	erm but the the astronauts themselves both Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were there but they didn't really talk about it that much
A	no?
B	and it ended up with somebody accusing I think it was Buzz Aldrin
B	but he just said I've had enough of this you know
A	mm
B	who walked on the moon
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I'd be I'd be telling everybody
B	you know and I just thought actually yeah there's all these interesting links that that maybe just fantastically educated people have put together and go huh
A	uh-huh
B	Cos it is well argued
A	right
B	through radiation
A	uh-huh
B	the furthest point
A	mm mm
B	technology we've got to actually you know
A	you wouldn't be able to
B	no chance
A	was there a Russian space exploration around that time? A bit later
B	mm there were loads yeah
A	was that?
B	er Yuri Gagarin and people like that
A	yeah that's right
B	no there's no question marks about that because they didn't actually make it get it to the moon
A	right
B	but it according to this book if I remember correctly they they were genuine
A	uh-huh
B	you know the Russians were actually winning the space race by miles
A	okay
B	and then suddenly the Americans were like ooh hello we've got one
A	yeah right
B	oh right okay
B	any more flights to the moon now
B	no we've been there done that
A	mm
B	and er there's so many
A	mm mm
B	I I read that book well as I say
A	mm mm
B	bizarrely yes
B	and I did
A	it is
B	well it is yeah
A	it was such a
B	but one another guy I spoke to an American
A	uh-huh
B	I just said you know I can believe that
A	mm mm
B	and they create all these things like you know the commie thing you know the
A	create Al-Qaeda
B	race
B	Al-Qaeda of course yeah
A	that's another conspiracy theory that Al-Qaeda don't actually exist
B	well
A	yeah
B	the er er we got you know Blaire stupidly got involved as well
A	mm mm
B	the Americans looked er er you know
A	mm mm
B	but now very big in America
A	uh-huh
B	quite anti French
A	the illegal war
B	and we were lied to about in the
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	american audience?
B	an American audience actually clapped
A	and what was er Susan's response?
B	er she went well yeah okay
A	was she?
B	not the best war
B	erm so she
A	she's quite a vocal supporter of is it democrats?
B	well she is very
A	mm mm
B	you know a sort of
A	right
B	political point
A	yeah yeah
B	it was just something about the food or something
A	mm
B	something silly
A	freedom Fries
B	freedom fries
B	but our special relationship dragged us into a war
A	mm
B	well it would be to most people
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	er but it's been you know proven by erm by a jury that was picked by Blair erm that that that it nothing untoward happened you know so
A	really?
B	I think he's got enough problems of his own though really but er
A	mm
B	yeah just as maybe it was done and dusted
A	yes
B	and here's this guy saying no no there's nothing wrong
A	mm
B	it was a bit out of left field as the
A	it was the timing of it though wasn't it really it's
B	it was perfect for er some people
A	ah
B	er it's just too
A	who done it?
B	coincidental
A	mm mm
B	A conspiracy
A	yep
B	and there's so many coincidences in life
A	that's true
B	you know just me bumping into someone on the street
A	mm mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	but when it comes to massive political and international
A	mm
B	decisions made by politicians or or declarations of innocence or whatever else
A	mm mm
B	and you think well hold on a minute
A	something smells fishy here
B	there's no smoke without fire
A	true
B	let's keep that going
A	we need another one
B	something smells fishy
A	let's think of another one quickly er
B	um
A	you can take a politician to water but you can't make him tell the truth
B	you can take a a horse to the to the water but a pencil must be lead
B	that's Laurel and Hardy
B	see he had a joke from nine
A	oh the comedy
B	nineteen twenty probably is still
A	do your you could  you could  film your own conspiracy comedy act
B	well there has been there have been two films that I know of that have actually said hold on a minute
A	yeah
B	was it Capricorn Thirteen? Anyway it was er OJ I think was in it actually
B	yeah yeah
A	with his glove
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they were just the innocent victims
A	okay
B	and it's a
A	mm mm
B	and then brilliantly there was a there's erm
A	uh-huh
B	er he's he's in a he's in the desert and then he stumbles in onto the set of a  of a  moon landing
A	ah
B	and it's just bizarre I think in a  in a  a studio
A	was it Moonraker?
B	no it wasn't Moonraker
A	no?
B	no it was one of the early ones
A	mm mm
B	Sean Connery's
B	and he just drives through
A	does he comment on it?
B	no no
A	or is it all left like?
B	well that's the comment
A	yeah
B	that's the comment
A	I I like that
B	well I suppose
A	now they have to point it out
B	yes
A	we were trying to infer that
B	the dumb down the dumbing down in television and film yeah
A	no
B	on New Year's Eve this year
A	uh-huh
B	where they all come together at the end
A	uh-huh
B	and they had a fantastic cast and everything but it was awful
A	mm
B	there you go
B	on tape to be stuck for a word
B	er in this
A	squishy? Er
B	no no no
A	back
B	no it's the  it's the  Morkish sentimentality of the
A	uh-huh
B	there's a word um in between that that I'm missing but
B	it'll come back to me
A	mm
B	and
A	cheesy
B	A lot of cheesy yeah
A	uh-huh
B	the feel good end
A	mm mm
B	now it's all it's a crowbar er a
A	yes
B	yeah a bit like The X Factor really
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm mm
B	I mean how do you discern between what's good and bad really
A	hmm mm
B	er yes you've got your judges and all the acts and stuff but again it's er it's all it it's all really if you're told something's good
A	mm mm
B	or Big Brother or you know Ollie Mur Mores Murs whatever his name is
A	yeah
B	yeah Jedward
B	very distinctly untalented
A	yeah
B	said of Jedward if you don't know they're twins
A	mm
B	and now they've just got this
A	oh no I did hear about Jade Goodie
B	yeah for the
A	the whole
B	well when she became famous I actually watched cos er people were
A	mm
B	and the first series
A	I watched the first series of Big Brother in Spain
B	the first two series really
A	and it was super
B	the Spanish version or the?
A	yeah
B	it was a social experiment yeah
A	and they chose lovely people as well who really
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it er under the microscope er you know not under the microscope but it would you know in in a verified situation but but it was more real I thought
A	yeah
B	getting these people who are characters on it
A	yes
B	anyway this one this Jade Goodie was so thick that people said you've just gotta you've gotta watch it
B	and she said  she said  that East  that East  Angular
B	and all this
B	that's another conversation
B	the word unbelievable
A	really?
B	the phrase is to be fair
A	uh-huh
B	erm unbelievable er er word
B	anyway erm and er then she became this sort of people's princess almost you know
A	um
B	certain people's princess
A	didn't she have a PR? A machine behind her
B	oh yeah
A	cliffard
B	well latterly when she had all the problems but
A	swinging it all for him
B	she had a good agent and um
A	uh-huh
B	and she married this bloke and just basically er since she's died has just spent all the money
A	blimey
B	and just wave and go ha ha
A	mm
B	you know where she was just it was  it was  racist bleeing
A	mm
B	human behaviour you could come across
A	but wasn't it just as you said the fact that she was thick and she didn't realise that it was?
B	er well no
A	then again she was making fifteen thousand a night
B	well she was thick
A	yeah
B	or whatever er else
A	mm mm
B	who just thought around the Essex area just thought she was amazing you know
A	mm
B	why? I didn't get it
A	mm mm
B	and isn't she
A	mm
B	she she racially bullied somebody
A	yep
B	on live on television
A	but she died on reality TV and that's
B	she
A	what people like isn't it
B	yeah
A	they like to see reality
B	and she raised awareness of cancer
B	we were all aware of cancer before Jade Goodie
A	mm
B	you know um
A	I think as you said it's car crash TV
B	it is yeah
A	and have a horrendous amount of money without actually having any talent
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and that people do like watching to see if people are going to succeed or fail and
B	yeah there's a gladiatorial thing isn't there now
A	mm
B	I er you know it really is thumbs up thumbs down and you're dead almost
A	mm
B	you know and
A	yep
B	it is car crash television
A	mm
B	will always have a market I hope
A	mm
B	documentary
A	yeah
B	and it might be about a celebrity
A	mm mm
B	so there's always a
A	yep
B	erm you know I've done  I've done  a lot of sport and there's always a cross over there
A	mm
B	erm but I did this documentary not so long
A	mm
B	who erm almost to person wanted to marry a footballer when they grew up
A	mm
B	that was it
A	mm mm
B	and then they've grown up since then in terms of that
B	and but that's all they really wanted to do
A	ah
B	young girls
A	mm
B	in particular post feminism you see who who you know their parents grandparents or whoever had fought for the right for a woman to earn and to be in the board room
A	yeah
B	you know to run companies and everything else
A	yeah
B	where it's all about how much money you've got
A	mm mm
B	and it doesn't matter who it's to as long as they're rich
A	how shallow
B	well I I know there's a few unfortunately
A	blimey
B	yeah
A	does he not know a thing called the prenup?
B	well no cos you know a lot of people don't
A	yeah well you you don't think
B	I mean this was fifteen years ago
A	right
B	now you know people don't get married
A	mm
B	A lot of my my contemporaries don't want to get married
A	mm mm
B	because of all this
A	fair enough
B	with marriages and divorce and everything
A	mm mm
B	and men have been absolutely clobbered financially
A	mm mm
B	you know it's not all one sided
A	yeah yeah
B	and I really worry for the this generation of kids who are growing up who haven't got the quite the  quite the  er erm they haven't been taught you've got to work at something
A	yeah yeah
B	the the education system now is almost about you do the work the day before and you pass it that day
A	yeah definitely definitely
B	and really work and go over the same subject
A	what what most surprised me when I was in school doing er the training was that kids don't have a any kind of work
B	yeah
A	and that's it
B	yeah
A	trying to learn this
B	yeah
A	and they're like but miss we're talking about what happened last night on Facebook
B	well there you go
A	you'll always I mean you'll always get that to some extent but it just surprised me as to how all pervasive it was that they didn't value learning
B	well the
A	they didn't value knowledge
B	no
A	they didn't
B	I interviewed um an eighteen year-old a couple of years ago now
A	mm mm
B	and I just said okay so tell me how you would go about researching um and I gave her I can't remember what the subject was but I gave her an example
A	mm mm
B	an hour long programme
A	resourceful
B	is that your answer seriously? So so basically anybody can walk in to this job and just go onto the internet and look it up? And so I said so what so er you're sure everything is correct on the internet
B	I was honest with her
A	mm
B	I said can I just teach you something er for the next job
A	mm
B	Don't ever ever say that
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and you've gotta do a certain amount of internet
A	yeah
B	which I do it
A	definitely
B	and you've got to back er that up with
A	one of the things that I teach as er academic English like how to reference things
B	that's the worst
A	the screen and I chose the thickest student in the class which
A	obviously I didn't say okay you thickest student in the class come here but
B	yeah
A	the kind of
B	oh yeah
A	made the point
B	that her she does most you know she goes on Wikipedia and she gets all her knowledge there
A	mm anyway
B	and I tried to explain to her again exactly what you just said
A	mm
B	it's incredible
A	mm
B	Cos it was just okay
A	mm
B	she didn't actually research the job
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	what most attracts their attention is commercial advertising campaigns that
B	yeah
A	kind of instil in them this this attitude that they have the right to
B	mm
A	these trainers that cost this amount of money
B	oh yeah
A	and they have a right to this car that cost this amount of money and they've got no er understanding of reality about what they're gonna have to do to get that amount of money
B	yeah yeah
A	and so they just expect that they have this God given right to that job or to that salary
B	oh it's shocking
A	mm mm
B	they wanna marry footballers cos they wanna have the lifestyle
A	mm
B	not so long ago
A	mm mm
B	so he's quite you know
A	mm mm
B	but it's a very basic
A	mm
B	er so it's it's not a great salary
A	mm mm
B	bad year twenty to fifty
B	she's a a teacher by the way
A	right
B	she's a teacher
A	mm mm
B	and they had a six bedroom house in Dorridge and both drove Porches
A	yeah
B	and you just go that doesn't add up
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that just does not add up
B	you are you're going for the lifestyle without in any way paying for it
A	mm
B	and sure enough they can't afford it
A	mm
B	the cars
A	crikey
B	let alone to live on
A	hmm
B	and that that's all because of the aspiration or whatever
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but it's also the the erm
B	erm it's this is the British society has become this there is erm
A	mm
B	and the worst thing you see it here a lot at David  There are a lot of kids
A	mm mm
B	people to
A	yeah
B	and I even at the time about two thousand and three two thousand and four er and I was thinking no you've never owed so much
A	mm mm
B	right I want a new car
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's not you know how much do you er what are you worth? It's only what you're worth after you've paid everything off
A	yeah yeah
B	they've got to pay that back before the value of the house actually keeps it
A	no
B	I spent a thousand
B	well I was part of actually cos the er the tennis social
A	mm mm
B	er after this game of tennis
A	huh
B	er what what what
A	he's not going to remember it
B	like oh well we'll try and limit it you know to to a thousand pounds per child or something for
A	mm
B	all er because they just say they want it
A	mm mm
B	there's no earning it
A	mm mm
B	sorry I should have turned that off
A	Don't worry
B	erm I'll see who it is
A	mm mm
B	and my dad worked in the post office all his life
A	mm mm
B	you know normal upbringing
A	uh-huh
B	with the help of granddad could pay for me basically
A	mm mm
B	quite a normal background and then you know was able to I was able to get a better education as it were
A	mm mm
B	because of the circumstances you know
A	really?
B	so they say so you know if can we bung him some money and he'll get us
A	yeah
B	you know I had to sit my eleven plus and actually get it
A	yeah yeah
B	and it was like uh God
A	meritocracy
B	and I I did pass just passed
A	mm
B	you know always will be
A	mm mm
B	erm now there's a lot of  a lot of  parents who think they just that their kids deserve
A	yeah
B	what they deserve
A	yeah yeah
B	when I was really small
A	mm
B	er cos my granddad owned um two or three news agents around Hall Green
A	oh yeah
B	and and has a store in
A	uh-huh
B	you know six o'clock on a Sunday morning I was up in the snow doing all that when I was fourteen fifteen
B	and you try and get a fourteen fifteen year old to do that now you can forget it
A	A job? What are you talking about?
B	exactly yeah
A	A holiday job?
B	but again a part of that whole X Factory type of thing
A	mm
B	I keep saying that
A	yeah yeah
B	I demand to have it
A	mm
B	you've gotta work at these
A	mm
B	you know and but it's also the fact that it's just you know it's almost  it's almost  because it the the bits in the X Factor I don't mind watching
A	mm mm
B	it's all about how bad people are
A	yeah but that's that's the way they choose them
B	yeah
A	three different piles
B	yeah you're right
A	just to make it
B	but there's all this erm
A	isn't it sad that that makes people watch it
B	well I watch
A	you're a rubber neck
B	that's the only bit I'll watch
A	car crash TV
B	well you can't help watching it
A	yeah
B	and the and they they
A	mm
B	seems to be about how bad these people are and how what a  what a  fool they make of themselves
A	yeah
B	and then they get with ooh yeah you're on stage
B	and then the people at the
A	yeah
B	you know
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	you sort of begin to lose a bit of sympathy with with me
A	it's crazy
B	if there's something er real
A	it's sensational and
B	well I watched The Apprentice the other night and that's the one programme I do actually quite like because
A	yeah
B	you can learn from it
A	mm mm
B	I can learn from it by watching these people who are mostly idiots who are mostly chosen to be idiots or to be a bit confrontational or to be a bit erm you know a bit good at what they are supposed to be doing
A	mm
B	I have to do that all the time you know
A	mm mm
B	so I pick up things from this programme and I think actually that's
A	yeah
B	that's interesting
A	uh-huh
B	don't do this
A	oh okay
B	or if I'm going to buy something
A	mm
B	I've been working for twenty odd years in television and you learn how to negotiate with Channel 4 the BBC and all that sort of stuff
A	mm mm
B	whereas the X Factor doesn't actually teach me anything
A	mm
B	big Brother didn't teach me anything
A	yeah but even sport isn't really sport any more
B	oh yeah
A	machine
B	well it it yes
A	mm mm
B	you know
A	do you know
B	yeah
A	yeah cos he I was chatting to him the other day and he said that he was a sports journalist who'd worked for Sky and since then
B	oh I'm thinking about another
A	oh he works on the bar here
B	not
A	I don't know
B	no I don't know this other
A	he's about twenty-four
B	oh right so he's probably done a
A	he's done a
B	he's probably struggling a bit yeah
A	yeah
B	hence why he's working here
A	struggling completely yeah
B	there was erm again there's I get a lot of people
A	mm mm
B	by just on principle
A	is that's cos it's too
B	Cos there are so many people
A	oh right
B	who are after each job
A	mm mm
B	if I'm doing a big production or something I get a series of runners researchers juniors for some researching and obviously they're younger people and I wanna give them a  give them a  chance
A	mm mm
B	most and maybe it's coming back to this dumbing down of education and it was  it was  deemed a an
A	mm mm
B	to get back in the two
A	right okay
B	back in the noughties
A	Micky Mouse thing
B	yeah
A	kind of yogurt studies
B	A Micky Mouse degree yeah
B	and what I find with media studies students is they're just er you know they'd know who won Big Brother in what year cos they've
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	completely
A	mm
B	erm but they certainly don't know how to actually make a programme
A	right
B	which is what I need
A	mm
B	a bit of experience
A	yeah yeah
B	er so I er I myself have decided that I'm only gonna hire people who have actually got either a erm a an actual degree you know in er I don't know what it would be er cos you don't get degrees in researching necessarily but you know
A	it's like broadcast journalism?
B	yeah
A	something like that
B	something more specific erm job-related
A	right
B	you know there are degrees
A	vocational type things
B	yeah vocational degrees yeah
A	mm mm
B	people er who have actually studied and worked
A	mm mm
B	again the X Factor thing as well
A	mm
B	ha
A	woo
B	no you can't
A	yeah
B	and you've got and you know you're a you're the next erm I don't know Alan Carr who I hate
A	mm mm
B	modern television in many ways
A	mm mm
B	but what having watched his show and listened to his radio show to a certain extent he's just not a funny man
A	no
B	he's a
A	uh-huh
B	that actually is not very funny
A	mm
B	whoop and the media American whoop and the applause and all that
A	no
B	but there is that as well
A	yeah
B	so when he's interviewing you know quite big celebs
A	mm mm
B	he's dreadful
A	mm mm
B	you know being a face and all that
A	right
B	and er um and he's very much
A	yeah
B	been talking about in this interview as it were
A	mm mm
B	erm that you know that that social media has well I think the dumbing down of education was part of this the process of it
A	mm mm
B	and then in the back in the nineties
A	do you think it was the agenda? Do you think it was er the effect?
B	it's cause and effect isn't it partly partly
B	I think  I think  it's a result of it
A	yeah
B	we've got this amazing technology where you can just go oh and you're talking to somebody else
A	mm
B	the trouble is you'll sit around this room next week when it's Easter holidays and you'll see a load of teenagers here
A	mm
B	but they're all on their
A	I hate that
B	all on their
A	my friends do it
B	oh they're playing games
A	or they're sending
B	no I'm I I just say no and people think of me as a bit of a
A	yeah
B	a bit of a dinosaur
A	well I had a a nineteen seventies brick mobile phone up until about a month ago when I had to change it cos it died
B	and I I just I have got a brick
A	mm mm
B	and now I have a erm er well I I got cloned so I I had to lose my old phone and then they're gonna give me one back again
A	mm
B	so in the meantime I've just got a pay as you go
A	and they're so but they
B	texts
A	but that's all you need
B	do you know what?
A	exactly
B	I quite like it
A	I agree
B	but Alison my girlfriend has got a er iPhone and they're fantastic
A	really? Do you like them?
B	and actually I've got this
A	uh-huh
B	and I've got er in fact one of the
A	uh-huh
B	I'll send you my CV
A	no but I'm sending out my CV to lots of places at the moment so it would actually be quite interesting to see how other people lay theirs out and
B	oh well there there you go
A	talking about researchers
B	let me send you that yeah
A	A quite close friend of mine at the moment is doing the research for a film they're gonna make about an American company is gonna make about the roots of reggae music
B	er what a documentary or a?
A	yeah
