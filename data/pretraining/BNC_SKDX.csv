A	as well I I was in the same education group as your
B	oh right wow that's amazing
A	so it was really incredible
B	it is
A	I'm just looking to see if the
B	but is that a well-known college that's the reason why for education that you both went there? or is it because there was more location in terms of near to home or?
A	I don't know why your mother went there but erm I went because I was very just er applied to all the Welsh ones
B	yeah yeah
A	you see so erm and
B	gosh so she must have been in some kind of the great all blacks which is actually so funny because you know the New Zealand rugby team is called the All Blacks
A	oh yes
B	I don't know
A	yes
B	it might have been they would have had hockey sticks
A	you would have thought so erm
B	and this is it here this is the
A	yes
B	having successfully passed her finals at
A	yes
B	take up her first teaching appointment
A	oh right
B	at the Queen's School for Girls
A	yeah
B	which is funny because my first proper teaching position I suppose erm was in
A	oh
B	not far really from
A	yes yes
B	and actually strangely the college in
A	yes I see yes
B	they made you do it
A	mmhmm yes
B	I mean it was a good thing to do but it was to get you on to the next rung of the salary
A	yes oh yes yes
B	that's the way they got you in
A	that's right yes
B	you know but I I worked there for two years so I actually was living in
A	yes yes
B	so the whole connection though
A	it's amazing isn't it? yeah
B	really it is you know in way I know
A	well I went sixty-four to sixty-seven and she left in sixty she left in sixty-four
B	mm
A	so three years that would be sixty-two sixty-one
B	sixty-four yeah yeah well I mean she had
A	oh so your brother was born seventy
B	yeah and so and she met mum er dad in erm well they got married in sixty
A	oh sixty oh no
B	they must have got married in sixty
A	so was your brother born abroad?
B	mm mm he was born in
A	oh that's
B	they were posted up there so
A	I see
B	so funny because really you know I was born in England I was born in
A	yes
B	erm and
A	yes yes very much yes
B	represent represent you know the Celtic so erm yeah it's interesting how how that turned out to be the case but yeah
A	yes
B	and that's my my grandmother there yeah
A	yes
B	and that was her great friend
A	so your
B	yeah yeah yes but I suppose there must be some resemblance to
A	I can't see it
B	can't see it no
B	I you see I
A	yes yeah
B	but that's a very hazy memory for me it's not something that I really recall very well so
A	yes yes
B	you know other than that I might have met
A	yes yes no yeah yeah so oh
B	you know so he really remains quite a
A	a mystery
B	he does really
A	yes well he is yeah I recognise this as
B	and he's much less of a mystery now that I know a bit more about mum
A	well it was amazing cos I didn't know about er
B	yeah
A	and this woman said to me are you expecting any mail? and I actually thought she meant M A L E
A	I kind of looked at her I said no and she said oh cos there's some registered mail there's a notice on the noticeboard you know that they had for students saying registered mail for miss
B	yeah
A	and I didn't so I didn't know until I was eighteen that my father had a daughter and the fact that we went to the same college
B	right ok
A	but she so she was there when I had my interview but she left
B	right
A	and it was that man where she's got the group photograph there
B	yeah
A	a Mr er
B	right
A	and I did erm so it was divided into the education was infants junior secondary so she and I both did
C	secondary
B	yeah yeah
A	and he said oh you anything belonging to
B	yeah
A	and the fact that my mother wasn't married was such a scandal so I just said oh no I think he said do you know her? so I quite honestly could say no
B	yeah yeah yeah said no I don't know her yeah yeah
A	I don't but it was amazing that we should be in the same group
B	yeah
A	and I don't know perhaps she didn't do she's got RE there oh she did geography
B	she did geography she did English and she did something else which was a bit erm sort of like home economics or
A	oh well you all had to do you had to do certain things were everybody had to do
B	right okay something like that yeah
A	yes but my main subject was RE
B	okay
A	whereas hers might have been geography
B	yeah I think it was
A	yes yes
B	so how much younger are you then than my than my mum?
A	right I don't really I can't remember I did know I was born in nineteen forty-five
B	yeah so she was born in forty-three
A	forty-three yes it's just two two years
B	yeah that would explain why you were at college kind of at about the same time yeah
A	and your mother's
B	yeah
A	and I was born in the October
B	that's no mum was born in December
A	oh December oh December I see
B	December tenth yeah yeah so yes yes so you're your birthday is this month?
A	yes yes so so it was really quite incredible and then oh it was some time later and then there was a chap called
B	oh yes I've heard all about him
B	in fact I've the
A	oh you've had a letter from him recently?
B	I have no well he keeps actually writing to my dad I do feel a bit sorry for both of them cos I think they're sort of locked into this thing
A	okay
B	where dad has agreed to give erm you know the measurements to to
A	oh
B	but I think what started all of this from what I can recall erm before my mum died was I got a sense that after my gran died erm that
A	yeah
B	at all erm so I think that really that came to a bit of a kind of a a head
A	I see yeah
B	erm but I think I was aware of the fact that some well not fact but some kind of sense of somebody from her past with some connection to her past probably was trying to come back into her present and I could sense that that wasn't making her happy at all
A	yes yes
B	erm but dad on the other hand has taken a you know I think he's taken more of a kind of a a objective approach which is you know this guy has been collecting this information for years and though he's not entirely sure why erm it's so important for him to have dad's measurements I think more importantly
A	you could yes
B	he's the
A	yes
B	we'd have some sort of genes there you know to share
A	yes yes yes it is possibly the
B	oh has he?
A	yes
B	well I suppose in terms of the
A	it's all the
B	you know the genes yeah
A	it's it's all an academic thing at the end of the day
B	mm mm mm
A	and he does have some papers published but it's all in academia it doesn't sort of help you in any way
B	mm
A	erm but that is
B	he seems like a nice old man I mean
A	he is he's an old man and he's in his eighties I expect and he's just continuing on what he's done all his life really because he also erm
B	right
A	but then he does as they as they branch out he'll do you know the the branch of where if
B	oh right
A	he does all of those as well so he's he must I don't know what his house must be like because he doesn't use a computer
B	no he doesn't
A	it's all written down
B	yeah he's written a long list here of measurements you know by hand
A	yes oh
B	well I haven't actually signed up for the tests yet you know because my brother and I haven't really discussed it erm
A	and your birth weight
B	the thing about it is is that
A	I see yes
B	and I know that she's not here today to say you know one way or the other but
A	these are things
B	I can be bothered to give him
A	oh droopy eyes that is quite yeah I think from I he's got droopy eyes and so I have I hate my eyes
B	oh
A	it's that's
B	mm well I'm scared of doing that I don't want to know my IQ
A	oh and he well he's done all of ours and my grandson and er but the worst ones are the taste ones and
B	yeah yeah
A	of is she too
B	well she wrote another letter because I think
A	yes he's blunt he does he
B	he's he's a bit blunt but he also insinuates insinuated something
A	oh I see
B	that could've been interpreted in slightly negative fashion about my grandmother
A	oh I see yes
B	now that really would've got me going because I had a very strong relationship with my grandmother
A	yes yes
B	erm and I didn't really like that so I sort of thought what if he really wants something from us wouldn't you be thinking you'd go along with a nice be nice and nice and nice rather than trying to put across something that almost was a little bit distasteful?
A	yes yes yes yes
B	well in fact it was distasteful he he basically said something along the lines of I can't remember the letter but you know
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	that
A	oh I see yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	I could probably see why my mum wasn't a big fan of
A	yes yes
B	cos that's the sort of thing she would've taken a real
A	well I I've never met him I know he does lots of these things I'm I but we haven't given him all this information he just sent us things from time to time and we haven't had anything for quite a while but we always knew his handwriting is distinctive so
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	but he is definitely still after us
A	well his yes and his wife has died now so he's obviously
B	yeah but the daughter wrote and I think she tried to make amends cos she may have erm read what he'd written or maybe he had had had second thoughts about what he'd written
A	yes
B	but he got I had the impression that he realised the error of his ways by writing something like that
A	yes I see yeah
B	and that you know certainly I would not take kindly to that
A	yes yes
B	and I think dad was actually a little bit upset by it too
A	yes yes
B	erm
A	yes
B	really couldn't be bothered either way
A	he's not yes yes
B	not at all
A	yes
B	and erm but she wrote and said something along the lines of no my father this is my father's life
A	yes he is yes
B	but I I'm a something else a marine biologist or something but I help him from time to time with his research or his data collection I think she was trying to say this and
A	oh I see yes yes cos if he is er we've been in touch with him for years but he's always been slightly eccentric
B	right so that must be it then
A	and and absolutely blunt
B	right crikey
A	and one might sort of say he's on an
B	yeah yeah okay
A	you know but but I've never met him but through all his letters er he he's quite outspoken and that
B	but what is the connection of the
A	oh he'd I think he's a
B	can I take that from you?
A	yes and I'll I'll because I my I've not because I've got so much knowledge there I can't
B	yes yes
A	and to say it easily right so our grandfather is called
B	right
A	and
B	oh no don't worry about it it's fact yeah
A	so his
B	yeah okay
A	so he's a
B	right yeah yeah I see it it's interesting
A	I if you go back like that
B	yeah
A	a brother a brother and sister married a brother and sister we come from
B	okay yeah yeah
A	so er so I think it makes us like a third cousin or towards me anyway
B	right
A	erm but
B	right
A	erm he does a lot so he will do it with the
B	mm mm
A	who's a good name he a
B	okay
A	and I think a lot is right but I'm not sure about everything that he's given not from my research
B	okay
A	because and he seems to be quite obsessed with illegitimacy
B	yeah
A	er now the I don't know if you've ever heard of judge
B	doesn't ring a bell
A	oh well no it probably won't but he he sat on the trial for the Great Train Robbery
B	oh right okay
A	well I and it it's just amazing because when I was in grammar school I think I was in first or second year er it was announced in assembly that one of the people from who'd gone to our school had been made a judge and that was him
B	wow
B	wow
A	erm he he his aunt was married to a
B	okay
A	his aunt from his
B	right
A	mother's side
B	yeah
A	and she died and the two of them the two boys lived
B	right
A	now that's my research says that and definitely his name is
B	yeah
A	but
B	oh yeah yes
A	so I I favour my research into
B	yeah yeah yeah oh well I'm beginning to get a bit of a picture now then about
A	yes yes
B	erm I just I find yeah I mean he's he is quite an intriguing individual
A	yes
B	but erm but I'm still not sure whether it's not long really since my mother died
A	no no
B	and coming back and I you know I was in
A	oh you were away yes
B	erm and so that was in two May two thousand and twelve and she died June seventeenth two thousand and twelve I was due to come back anyway on a on a holiday with my husband
A	yes yes
B	actually that weekend we flew on the sixteenth of June you know you leave
A	yes yes mm
B	so I didn't really erm you know I didn't really have much time to spend with her when she was dying so
A	no no
B	but it was so quick you know it was so it was just one of those aggressive cancers and
A	mm
B	it was and then it spread into the liver and I think that maybe the lung and you know it it was just
A	yes how long did she have from the time she knew?
B	well actually I you know I'm I wasn't there so should probably not say much but you know I know
A	yes
B	you know because we didn't quite know at that stage how far the cancer had spread and he was like well she's on the list for the MRI she's on the list she's on the list she's on the list
A	yes
B	she keeps getting bumped off the more and more and more
A	yes yeah yeah
B	so well how about my mum's lost the
A	yes
B	you know from the time that I I think I Skyped her early May and I thought god she looks very gaunt
A	yes yeah yeah
B	her face had actually gone into that kind of look
A	yeah
B	where you think to yourself but I thought she had been diagnosed with diabetes too
A	yeah
B	and they told her to change her diet radically I mean my mum loved everything that was basically bad for her
A	yes yes
B	she loved it
A	mm mm
B	so she really slimmed down pretty quickly on this new diet you know low salt low sugar and everything
A	mm mm yes yeah
B	and so I thought well maybe it's a bit of that but then I thought in the back of my mind no no no no there's something else there that'll explain this look
A	yes
B	and she actually phoned me on Friday I was yeah Friday evening and she said to me
A	yes
B	erm she said yeah I think I've got cancer or I've got what granny had now my my granny had a a sort of
A	yes yes yes
B	you know in your seventies which is when granny got it
A	yes yes
B	erm so I said oh crikey mum
A	mm mm
B	I hadn't seen her in about a year and a half so I wouldn't know so I asked dad and he said oh I don't know I don't know she's a bit you know confused and  said well you're not gonna be that confused you know if you're not healthy you know
A	yes yes yes yes
B	so I said well let's see you know go to the doctor and it was to me the way it sounded just sounded horrific because she basically used to love a lovely chair like this and she used to sit in her chair
A	yeah
B	and she'd watch the television down in the sitting room and she went probably to get up and she realised
A	yes so she couldn't walk
B	that there wasn't anything left you know that these
A	gosh yes
B	which time she hadn't been able to I mean they didn't have a way at that time to get her to the bathroom
A	yes yes mm
B	so it all sounded quite from what I can say it sounded like quite a long time had passed before my dad had really clicked that something quite serious was going on with my mum erm and then the GP took blood tests and blood tests and blood tests
A	yes
B	but she still sat in the chair they didn't actually take her by ambulance to the hospital
A	yes right
B	so my poor father was trying to take care of my mum
A	yes yes
B	you know with the basics
A	yes
B	which he wouldn't have known much about how to do
A	no
B	he really sort of doesn't have a bedside manner
A	yes yeah
B	he really doesn't have much of one
A	yes yeah
B	so it was all quite
A	yes I see
B	and I and then she got to hospital and she hates doctors and she hates hospitals
A	yes
B	even when I was in hospital she really didn't want to come and see me and er so I knew this would  be very this would've been the worst thing you know for her to happen but
A	yes yes
B	she was in there fourteen days erm until they realised that she was actually well they said to her look we can give you erm er you know we know it's we know it's spread we know it's aggressive erm we can tell you how much of it really there is in the liver by taking a erm what do they do? you know they go in and they take a kind of
A	yes yeah
B	but my mum said well listen you know you're telling me that I've you're telling that I'm dying so you know erm why do you need to do that then? and they said well only just because and she said well if it's just because no not really I prefer to go home to my dog and my cats and
A	so did she have she she didn't have chemotherapy?
B	she chose not well she was too
B	they said they couldn't do anything for her
A	so it was quick?
B	yeah it was so there was so much of it that it was just
A	yeah and how long did she live from the time she was diagnosed?
B	well she was diagnosed on about er I suppose maybe May the fifteenth and yeah she actually died a month later
A	really?
B	but the problem was was that the doctors you know what they're like you know some of them are I should say the consultants but some of the are very good cos I've I'm sure you know as well unfortunately you know people have passed away from cancer and you hear all the different ways that the doctors talk about how long people have to live you know and this one had said to my dad erm I would think in erm day no I would think in months I would think in weeks and months not years and
A	yeah yeah
B	you know and I'm not a nurse or a doctor
A	no no
B	but I you can there's a smell as well you can sort of
A	really yes?
B	it is that you know it's that smell as well and I just thought to myself well she's got a couple of days erm I didn't know it was just a couple of hours so everything was kind of like that it was
A	yes yes
B	than having this
A	dragged out yes yes
B	protracted you know and the palliative you know care was such that at least she got to die in her own home which was fantastic
A	yes yes
B	you know cos granny died in
A	oh really?
B	so it's like four women in the family have actually fortuitously in a way
A	yes yes
B	been able to have that
A	that's right and it's much much better yes yes
B	oh much better and she had the dog and she had the cats and she had you know
A	yes yes
B	but nobody was actually in the room when she passed away and it wasn't until the nurses had come for their midday you know that was their
A	yes yes
B	pop in at midday and they I wasn't there but they came in to
A	yeah yeah
B	and er so really she she she went her on her own but in a way that's mum because I turned round to her and said erm I turned round to mum and I said mum I'll just see you in about fifteen minutes cos I'm popping out now to get something and she was like this and she had this look on her face and she was literally like that
A	yes
B	and I I thought to myself now that's a woman who she's doing it her way
A	yes yes yes
B	whatever that meant to her but I could tell that was the strength of her character and her will and her determination I think you know
A	mm mm yes yes
B	so that's a nice thing to have as a last memory
A	that's right yes yes
B	but it's yes it's incredibly sad and you know
A	yes yes yes very
B	it is and so it's still very raw for me in many ways because being cos I went back to
A	yes yes
B	so I went back and er I said well I'll see how it goes if I miss her a lot then maybe I should come back to
A	yes that's right yes yes
B	but now I really miss her a lot because I'm back in the house
A	yes yes that's right yes
B	but she's not there and you really feel that from that
A	mm yes I'm sure yes
B	but you feel bits of her there but bits of her not there so you kind of
A	yes yes yeah it's hard isn't it? and how old are you?
B	it is
A	forty-one yes
B	my brother turned forty-four just a few days ago
A	oh really yeah
B	so end end of September
A	yeah so your brother is the same age as my daughter
B	forty-four yeah
A	forty-four but she was forty-four in February
B	right okay oh right? so and your daughter's living in
A	yes yes
B	yeah oh well
A	yeah she lives in
B	nice yeah
A	yes yes
B	and she's a a lawyer I hear?
A	that's right yeah she she works in the city
B	right
A	so er yes
B	yeah and she's done that for a wee while?
A	yeah she been well she's always been a solicitor
B	right
A	erm and she's always worked in the city and she's lived in
B	oh she's married
A	she isn't married she lives with her partner
B	oh right okay
A	and erm they don't have any children
B	yeah yeah
A	and erm she found that
B	yeah yeah
A	and they they like the sort of the the art galleries and the fringe
B	yeah
A	erm theatre and that sort of thing
B	yeah yeah
A	so they only stayed here for a short period of time about three years I think it was and they had a three or four bedroomed house in the old town
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and they sold that and they bought a one bedroomed flat in
B	yeah I know it's crazy when you think about it isn't it?
A	it's so expensive
B	mm mm
A	and he lives in the old town in
B	yeah
A	it's a
B	I have heard of Dune I
A	it's a
B	yeah it's the shoe company isn't it? that's it
A	that's right it's a shoe company it's not Clarks I buy Clarks
B	yeah
A	yeah so he's oh I see so he
B	oh great isn't that funny really how things are?
A	oh it's just amazing
B	yeah
A	be oh and that's what I was going to say and then it was
B	yeah
A	you know I know that she is my half-sister but she isn't my sister because we never knew each other
B	no no no
A	but lives in
B	yeah yeah
A	and so you know I said this is where
B	yeah yeah wow so you weren't half tempted to sort of pass and say hello or
A	I didn't I know at that time her mother was alive
B	yeah
A	your your grandmother and I just didn't think it would be very tactful really
B	yeah yeah yeah that's true I'm sure it wouldn't have been though granny I'm sure would have loved to have met you
A	yeah oh I see yes
B	because she just loved meeting people
A	I
B	yeah but it isn't probably it's not the done thing yeah
A	yes no it's it's a strange old situation I mean the other thing which was quite funny when my father went into hospital when he was first ill erm he had a massive stroke
B	did he? right
A	and so his his memory went just you know I mean people get erm dementia and as you get older and you remember but he just didn't remember anything but
B	yeah
A	erm that er
B	yeah
A	he had a very enquiring mind I don't know if your mother told you that
B	right okay
A	oh well he had a very enquiring mind and he he played he played chess he taught and he would go down to the school and teach the children to play chess
B	oh did he?
A	but he played draughts at championship level and he could tell you that he could win a game in ten moves or you know that sort of business
B	right wow wow
A	and he oh and when we when you visited him he loved doing the things that
B	yeah yeah
A	he'd make you read a whole thing and you've got to answer it and then he said yes but at the end he says do not take any
B	yeah
A	you know only
B	yeah yeah the word games all this sort of thing
A	yes yes
B	yeah
A	so he loved asking
A	and because of oh yes well you did like the ladies and I said but associated
A	and how the association of my mother and
B	okay
A	er but he was looking at
B	older brother
A	younger brother
A	yeah he only had one brother younger and so he went to me oh I'll go and get
A	but
B	oh right yeah
A	I don't know that was just a kind of impression and I said well
B	no no sure
A	cos he was asking me lots of different things
B	okay
A	erm so that was really really funny though and erm oh so then sometime later we went to
B	yeah
A	erm that knew us so cos
B	oh had she?
A	to
B	oh right
A	so we went down there and erm we went to chapel and I said to to I never liked my eyes and they're actually like my
B	right
A	and I always go on about them and I looked behind and I said to
A	yes yes so
B	yeah so when did your dad die then how long ago was it?
A	oh
B	yeah I can't really place the year
A	no I can't think about it erm well we went to see him when
B	yeah
A	I think I think it's as long ago as that I've got it all recorded I'll I'll show you afterwards
B	yeah I have got a little cutting from it must be his obituary somewhere may maybe a paper that somebody had sent from Wales up to granny or something because I actually have that I have a cutting from the newspaper
A	yes yes oh yes yes
B	erm but it doesn't have the date on it so
A	yes yeah I can't really remember dates erm I'm not very good at I can't remember
B	no I'm terrible with dates as well
A	the different people and erm
B	so you've been researching this family sort of ancestry quite a bit then?
A	yes yes yes really I was very interested in in when I was young because my grandmother this is my mother's family erm she she was different in Wales because she came from
B	right I see yes
A	and she used to tell me about when she lived in
B	oh wonderful
A	and erm and then things about my grandfather because I thought that everybody in the village where I lived was related to me
B	right
A	and then when I got older I thought that's because we all in Wales everybody calls everybody aunty
B	yeah
A	but when I began to find out about it I was related to a lot of them
B	wow
A	because my grandfather was one of ten children and then the cousins and you know so
B	yeah yeah so where did you grow up then which part of Wales?
B	okay
A	near
B	yeah
A	and
B	hard
A	we went up to er so then
B	yeah yeah
A	I'd always been interested but I started doing it when I was about fifty I think and we went up then you used to go up to Middleton Street in London and get all the books down
B	yeah
A	so we went up and we first of all and they got people there that will help you and the earliest census is in eighteen forty-one
B	right
A	so I said oh we couldn't find
B	right
A	I said well I know
A	and er anyway we couldn't find it so as we were there we just thought we'd look at the
B	oh
A	erm but my aim and do I still do it because I want to get every
B	wow
A	and I contacted loads of people and online I came across this man who lives in Australia and I just wrote him a letter and said that erm had he did his parents come from
B	oh no seriously
A	and we were going out doing testings and he stayed there and he lived not far from here
B	wonderful
A	and he was from
B	yeah
A	erm and so I've been in touch with so many people and lots of them I've recorded it I think say there were forty families in
B	right
A	and there's one young man I keep in touch with
B	oh good that's nice
A	and but we can't we're not we can't find ourselves related
B	oh can't you? no
A	and we've even met erm when we went down to
B	oh lovely
A	and he's so really you know such a researcher he's more into finding out about the
B	yeah
A	but erm it's a really interesting family
B	so is some of your research dovetailed together? you know
A	oh yes yes yes
B	yeah that's great yeah
A	so it's really fascinating
B	it is mean forty I wouldn't yeah
A	no
B	so and then that's when I realised that it isn't and then now you tell me there's only forty
A	yes
B	from your research
A	families yes yes yes
B	families not twenty-eight or something come from
A	yes
B	ah and so this what did you call them?
B	wow
A	they would say
B	and this is a this is a double-barrelled name?
A	it's a it's no it's
B	no
A	no
B	I see oh right
A	all very close together it's a place there but
B	yeah
A	er he says that we've actually come from Ireland before that erm because I think it was the governor of and some of this is historical fact the governor of I think it was
B	yeah
A	of of royalty
B	yeah okay alright
A	but you know I'm not I'm not interested in that I just want to get the order
A	but there is erm there is a famous
B	yeah
A	is where all the monks are
B	yeah I'd love to go one day
A	and he he did own that I got the
B	wow yeah
A	but I want to just show you you were I mean the the your mother's not on any of them and I tried to see if I recognised any of those ones but the same I don't know where that one
B	oh so with your college friends
A	yes right well you recognise the erm the buildings oh it because it was a prisoner of war camp
B	oh right
A	so they were Nissen huts
B	oh
A	so it was all Nissen huts sort of done up all on one long road and you've got all the Nissen huts around a campus sort of thing and then there's the main building up there and when your mother went it would have been all girls
B	yeah
A	when I went they were introducing men
B	right
A	and I think there were three men who were all mature and lived in
B	yeah
A	so there was great
B	a growing number
A	a great but you could say that they were mixed but no it was would have been all women when when your mother went yes
B	yeah and is it still a teaching college today?
A	it's not there any longer
B	no
A	erm but I think it's
B	oh okay yeah
A	but we went up a few years ago a good few year ago to have a look and the whole area it's it's a big erm social services
B	is it?
A	big
B	ah yeah
A	so er
B	ah
A	yes but I just
B	yeah
B	so how long have you lived here in this house?
A	oh erm since nineteen seventy-six
B	wow
A	so we're not big movers
B	yeah wow that's great that's so and did you used to work in
A	yes
B	yeah you did
A	yeah and I had a few different sorts of jobs cos I taught
B	yeah
A	and erm but then when the children were towards the end of erm junior school and
B	yeah yeah
A	so I got a bit tired and I gave up teaching but I worked as a volunteer to the Citizens Advice Bureau
B	yeah
A	but then within a year I became the deputy manager with responsibility for training
B	oh wow
A	so I was using my teaching things to teach them
B	yeah skills yeah
A	I was there for a long time I really enjoyed that
B	yeah that's great
A	and I became a magistrate as well
B	oh did you?
A	so yes
B	crikey wow
A	yes yes so
B	yeah
A	yes until it just become more and more difficult for me to walk
B	yeah
A	so that's why I er gave it up
B	yeah
A	but er
B	ah what a shame isn't it? sounds like a really good thing to do
A	yes yes yes yes yeah it was really interesting
B	yeah
A	it was fascinating
B	all kinds of people and
A	well that I
A	you know people would say oh how do you like to do that? but it was it was really interesting to see the sort of people that you
B	yeah
A	and while you wouldn't have said that person's going to be in trouble you weren't surprised to see him there
B	see his face
A	yeah so people don't change that much from a young age
B	which is that I know and that's the sort of depressing thing about it in a way
A	mm yes yes
B	you can already pick them
A	that's right you can can't you? so you've taught in a secondary school?
B	I've never taught in a secondary school no I I don't have secondary qualifications
A	mm
B	erm I have post-compulsory which allows me to work in a further education college
A	oh I see yes yes
B	or a language school which is mostly what I do
A	I see yes
B	erm so really yeah post sixteen I'd say
A	ah yes
B	erm no I never had secondary but erm but yeah it's it's incredible cos I
A	mm
B	erm in fact I studied film and went on to do
A	oh really
B	yeah media and film that type stuff and
A	yes yes
B	and had my own company for a little while
A	oh
B	made educational videos more like for charity videos and things erm documentaries so research kind of things in terms of documentaries but then yeah I think you know it just sort of I guess it is a calling in a way
A	yes yes
B	and I realised that my great love really is the for teaching and and I thought oh well I'd better do this properly
A	yes
B	get all of my qualifications
A	yes yes yes
B	and I just finished my masters of education
A	oh I see
B	yeah I did it by distance learning
A	I see yes
B	from from Australia with the
A	yes
B	it was all online
A	mm mm yes
B	all distance so it was all quite you know different way of learning but
A	yes yes it is yes must be yeah
B	but a great great great degree I mean I really enjoyed it erm and so I don't know what will happen with the masters we'll see what happens but
A	yes
B	hopefully people it'll see it as being a good thing
A	yeah I'm sure yes
B	I hope so I don't really know
A	no no yes
B	but you know
A	oh yes
B	I don't necessarily do it for the career advancement
A	no
B	I think I do it more to keep my brain active
A	yes well that's what matters yes
B	and in education you should be
A	yes
B	leading by example
A	yes there's an element yes
B	and I was working as a yeah I was working as a learning advisor at this university in
A	yes no yes
B	I mean they're wonderful researchers you know they're PhDs
A	mm yes yes
B	but they haven't got a clue about what to do with you know three hundred four hundred people on their course
A	that's right yes yes
B	so I was asked to come in and give some you know nice talks gentle coffees and
A	yes yes
B	sort of chocolates and see if I could win them over with this idea of that teaching is actually quite an important thing to know how to do well
A	yes yes
B	erm and er so then I got sort of you know taken into different projects and things so yeah it was a really great job because in a way I was I had the best of both worlds I had the the learners coming to me and asking for advice about their how do you know reference something? and how do you start your your essay? how do you do critical thinking? but then I was also working with their teaching in a way to try to help them and I'd often say you lot need to talk
A	yes yes
B	you need to like understand each other's point of view and erm and often that would help you know that I could do little bit of both but I quite like that position because in a way I think though I do I did miss having my own students as in a class
A	mm yes yes
B	and seeing them
A	yes
B	you know every day or every week or something I missed that cos I worked in
A	yes yes
B	so I did two years at
A	yes yes
B	and I it was too expensive as well to be honest with you so I got this permanent position at
A	mm mm
B	and I got pulled into the different projects and one of the projects I liked was being a form tutor and pastoral tutor for erm thirty-five Norwegian students
A	ah
B	who'd come over to go to the college to receive their
A	yes
B	fighting for themselves though they were staying with families in
A	yes yes
B	but they were independent and that they would you know have improved their English skills so I was their English teacher as well as their form tutor and their personal tutor
A	yes yes
B	but the erm that was lovely you know that was really great because they were at that age where you could see they're about to
A	yes yes yes
B	from high school what they call high school and go off into to universities and do whatever they were starting life so I did actually quite like that age I thought that was nice
A	mm yes yes
B	and I had them for a whole year you know so I miss that a bit
A	mm yes so where did you go to university?
B	well I went er and did business erm what they call business and management now but at the time it was business studies
A	ah yes
B	erm I went from ninety-two to ninety-six I did a work experience year which is part of the degree
A	yes
B	erm in
A	oh yes
B	it's er not far from
A	yes oh yes I I mm mm
B	round that part you know the bottom of
A	yes yes
B	and I was an au pair as a way to get started in Germany
A	oh yes yes yes mm
B	and I went to
A	yes yes
B	so I went and did a masters at erm
A	oh yes yes
B	in film making and that that did me well for a little while and then I went off and did a French and German thing which was a quite an unusual it's sort of professional training but it was meant for European producers and distributors so I got onto that and that was the second year they ran that course and it's still running but it's much bigger now but but that was nice because I was student at
A	oh yes fantastic yes yes yes mm mm
B	erm that I still really couldn't use the the the certificate well the qualification or the language skills to actually make a go of it I think it was the wrong timing I'm not quite sure but anyway I was either a little bit ahead or a little bit behind I wasn't sure but it was timing wasn't right
A	mm mm
B	so I decided to go out on my own and set up my own production company and I parked up with a Polish lady and we made documentaries together about
A	yeah
B	just because it was little bit different
A	that's right yes
B	and had more chance of getting commissioned
A	yes yes
B	and so we did a few things together but we didn't have enough money to make a good go of it
A	oh I see yes yes
B	so I I thought oh wow what am I gonna do? and er and I think yeah that's when it I sort of realised that actually teaching was more the thing that I wanted to do
A	mm mm yes yes
B	and I realised that filmmaking is nice but it's
A	yes yes that's right yes
B	and be really determined you know
A	yes yes
B	and I though well am I that determined? no I'm not so what's the other thing I like to do? and it was teaching you know so
A	mm yes yes
B	yeah
A	oh that's great and what does your brother do he works in
B	he does yeah he he started off more as a sales erm in publishing selling advertising
A	oh publishing oh I see yes
B	well he actually worked at
A	yes yes yes yes yes
B	he's now you know er work in advertising
A	mm mm
B	but he does sort of more the social media technologies communications more of that kind of creative you know
A	yes yes yes
B	big campaigns for Lloyds Bank and B and Q and blah blah you know
A	oh I see yes yes
B	erm but he's trying out for the job actually next week with the UAE government for Expo twenty twenty
A	yes
B	so it's a pretty big job er but anyway apparently erm you know he's in with a chance but he also has another job in the wings which is a job with Etihad the airline company
A	oh yes yeah
B	which would mean he'd be in Dubai anyway
A	mm yes yes
B	so it looks like he's going to
A	I see so he's not married
B	no he's not married no and he hasn't been married before no and he no he you know he doesn't have any kids so erm he's footless footloose and fancy-free and you know
A	yes yes yes
B	he's about to to go off and have a new new adventure you know in Dubai and
A	yes yes quite something yes yes
B	yeah so that's lucky in a way because one's gone but one's come back you know so it's
A	has come back that's right yes so that's so that's good for him
B	yeah yeah yes I think so
A	but it is amazing the sort of the connection with
B	yeah
A	and
B	right
A	erm I don't keep in touch with her much but he was in
B	oh right
A	so if you ever
A	I think it might be
B	yeah okay well I'll have a look around yeah
A	yeah you might see him he
B	yeah yeah
A	she's in her third year studying medicine
B	okay wow
A	so it's and my grandson has just gone to
B	has he?
A	he's at
B	right
A	so it's really strange that I mean we're not far from er
B	from yeah
A	up to
B	it is the connection is I mean really it's quite random well random in a way not random really but erm they could have gone another way but you know but you know had had granny not
A	yes
B	you know I really I think you know I mean really what that was what propelled her forwards over to this part of the country I think because she had
A	yes so was her mother already here then or they came together?
B	no no I think it was really granny's decision with a lot of advice and persuasion from her first cousin who married into the
A	okay those yes yes
B	yeah so her first cousin
A	yes
B	granny bought it and moved everyone up
A	yes yes
B	so she moved her mother
A	and yeah and her sister
B	and she moved aunty er well aunty
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and the three well basically granny looked after the two of them
A	yes yes yes
B	and then she had got well of course granny you know said to mum what are you going to do with your teaching qualification? you have to do something
A	yes yes yeah
B	erm and I suppose the idea was that she come here to
A	so did your mother used to go down to
B	I think she had almost two lives gran you know she had a life down in
A	oh I see
B	where mum would be
A	yes yes
B	but quite a lot of the time she was in
A	oh I see
B	or as in
A	yes
B	so throughout mum's teenage years and perhaps even when she was quite you know even before a teenager I get the impression that you know granny had other things to do put it that way
A	yes I see yes
B	and I don't know how much mum really did actually get to see of her
A	ah ha I see yes
B	yeah because I got the impression that her grandmother brought her up quite a bit
A	ah ha I see cos I know she went back to
B	yeah
A	erm they knew they knew your mother and one of them I can't remember where the other one came but one came from
B	yeah
A	so I I thought that she so she was going there to her granny then not to her mother really?
B	yeah I think so
A	yes that was her
B	think so maybe it was just the proximity as well is that you go for a weekend or
A	oh yes yes yes yes
B	or something I don't but
A	yes it would
B	right that's yeah
A	not as far as going over to
B	or it could have been that granny had sort of forewarned my mum said look you know I'm pretty much thinking of going here
A	yes yes
B	can you see if you can get a teaching position pretty quickly after you graduate
A	yes that's it
B	and see if you can get close to where I am
A	mm yes yes
B	close to me
A	yes
B	and I guess they were just lucky to have it all happened so quickly
A	yes yeah
B	I get the impression that that year erm must have been quite a lot of change
A	yes yes yes yes I see yeah
B	but yeah I you know and then granny really just established herself in
A	yes really severed yes
B	well yeah quite sort of loose really
A	yes yes
B	and the only person I think that she really really missed a great deal was her great friend
A	yes yes
B	erm and we would have make treks down to
A	yes
B	you know it's it's a world apart
A	yes yeah but it's so interesting because of the name erm my cousin
B	yeah
A	erm my mother's sister married a
B	right
A	a very common name in Wales and erm he had a car accident and couldn't continue the job that he was doing he was a policeman and they just said he could work in the office but he didn't want to work in the office he wanted to do all the other business
B	yeah
A	er so they moved to
B	right
A	but they moved the other side they call it there's one side and the other side so they lived
B	yeah
A	erm but when my aunty died a few years ago and we were at the funeral and my cousin's mother-in-law was there and I don't know how it came up about you know my name but she got the
B	yeah
A	and she said and I taught a girl called
B	that's funny isn't it?
A	but it's such a small world
B	it's a small world
A	it's really incredible
B	it's that's funny isn't it?
A	yes but there's one other thing I must tell you about erm the name of
B	right
A	but in eighteen forty-one there's an
B	no
A	yes and one the address is
B	that really is because my granny would have been
A	oh really of course
B	yes
A	but I can't relate well
B	right
A	but I can't I can't find out whether
B	yeah
A	and he married and I don't know if you know the names there very well
B	I think it is I'd have to ask my dad but I think it is
A	he married a somebody
B	yeah I think it's
A	I really have to try you know I have to think where does he come from? why can't I find his and I put you put
B	yeah so how did you come across
A	well I
B	right okay
A	and then you can just ask the census it you can bring up the eighteen forty-one census and just say find all
B	right
A	so that's how I came across her
B	and yeah and do you know how long they lived in
A	I haven't got much of an idea at all
B	but they would have been there in eighteen forty-one yeah?
A	yes they were there eighty-forty-one he had died by then both of her parents I got shall I go I can't I don't know which
B	yeah please do
A	but I mean it'll only be the same photos as your mother
B	I'll just stop this
A	I won't be a minute
B	mm mm
A	whereas our family come from that end and I can't see
B	so that's the family coat of arms is it?

B	oh wow
A	yes
B	and how did he meet
A	yes well she I don't know where she came from

A	because my daughter laughs at me she says I can't believe mum she said I used to tell people that my father didn't live with us because there wasn't enough room in the house
A	she says I can't believe you believed that mum I said well my mother told it to me so I did believe it
B	of course yeah
A	and I didn't know that he was remarried until erm I
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	and then when our children were little erm we met with him and went to his house and met
B	yeah
A	and there was er something on the sideboard or whatever about is it twenty-five years silver?
B	yeah I think so
A	something about a
B	okay
A	and I had a quick calculation and I thought crumbs I was eight then when they got married I assumed it must have been them cos there was nobody else so he was married to

A	oh I see

B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	it says he was he was eighty-nine and he was born at
B	uncle great-great-uncle
A	yeah erm he was a county counsellor and he was a liberal they were all liberals

B	original research from nineteenth century
A	yeah
B	which led to being awarded a masters of philosophy degree award five years of hard work
A	yes
B	mm set it in
A	oh I thought it was something to do with yeah
B	she was given five years to complete and write up her research part-time however for the first three years her husband
A	yes
B	copies of her thesis are now in the reference library at
A	yes yes now I've tried to get those books and I I I got one of them and I think it's the most expensive book I ever bought
B	yeah
A	well it was so funny because it's out of print and I must sort of see read it because you can get anything if you go through the library they'll find it but I went online to see if I could get it
B	yeah
A	and somebody had it to sell and I it cost me twenty pounds
B	wow
A	but the funniest thing was that it was a library copy they sent me
B	no they stole it
A	that somebody had had and kept and
A	and was selling it I've never spent so much well I might have done
B	money on a library book yeah
A	but a library book was just you know
B	and was it any good?
A	I enjoyed it
B	yeah
A	I erm I think it was
B	it doesn't no it just says published in nineteen eighty-one
A	yeah I think I must I must I I did oh I looked I looked under her name and found three that looked as though they were sort of
A	but you can see this is interesting because you can kind of see I think that because
B	yeah
A	or all the details
B	OBE and BSc like you know he's actually really interested in and
A	yes that's right yes you've got to know so that that's
B	yeah that's that's very much like the days

B	yeah it's incredible
A	and
B	amazing
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and when you come down the hill and you go around

B	mm
A	and how old they were we have long actually she was quite young but in our family we have long livers
B	oh good
A	yes

A	but there's lots of mention of different
B	yeah yeah
A	and they're all I've checked them all and they're all our

B	oh I see so that's how
A	so that's so he was see he so he owned the farm in eighteen ninety-one
B	right yeah
A	erm
B	goes back quite a way
A	oh yes he oh eighteen eighty-one
B	wow
A	so this is who was living in all of them then this this is lovely cos that's
B	mm
A	mm yes
B	but really farming was the major you know that was the success of the family was through farming was it?
A	yes farming the
B	farmers yes

B	they're all the way back is farming yes
A	yes and
B	oh god
A	and er he had
B	right yeah yeah
A	but yes the the
B	farmers
A	I can't think of anything that's different
B	yeah
A	erm so that's
B	yeah
A	so that's I don't know what that is
B	it's Australian electoral rolls
A	oh yes yes well I've got the well this
B	in
A	yeah where they I think
B	wow
A	they went to Australia
B	god when in nineteen fourteen
A	yes so and then this is well I I put these things to give
B	farmers
A	so they were farmers
B	yeah
A	now these weren't at
B	right
A	but she's the first one in eighteen seventy-one farmer of four hundred and fifty acres who went to
B	so she took the family there
A	she took the family there from
B	cos she
A	yes
B	and she thought she would try something different I suppose
A	yes I don't I I don't really
B	saw this as an opportunity maybe
A	oh
B	so how many children did she have? she had one two three four
A	five well
B	five four servants three labourers
A	oh yes yes
A	yeah so they were quite well off they had servants now this
A	slowly these things come into to my mind
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yes he was in
B	of
B	yeah
A	yes
B	gosh and what's this thing about Canada here then?
A	oh that's I think that's his his son went he had a son called
B	yeah yeah
A	you can get passenger lists
B	wow
A	so I put in
B	yeah
A	but it doesn't look as if he ever married because there doesn't seem to be any
B	no
A	oh I'll have to tell you another story so there they are he was at
B	great aunty
A	yes so this is the farm that they had at
B	oh that's nice
A	and we asked them and then when I said who we were
B	yeah
A	he is belonging to the
B	so he's he's your second cousin
A	mm it's amazing
B	amazing isn't it? yeah
A	yes but erm yeah then there they were at
B	so these are all your descendants then or our descendants then?
A	ancestors yes yes yes
B	ancestry yeah sorry
A	this is all their farms we we've
B	yeah I bet he is
A	his car especially when we had a a saloon car
B	yeah
A	he's not so bothered about this but he said god it's filthy going down all those farm tracks
A	I'm not going anymore
B	yeah
A	I'm not going on anymore farm tracks
A	ah I
A	mm
B	but of course I mean granny became
A	then this is
B	yeah
A	basically erm and then I wrote to these people in I found them online or something they are in
B	er
A	it's America anyway
B	what does she say let's see er
A	but they they they're in
A	and they are she's got a different name and they are
B	yeah
A	it's lovely to be in touch with them she sent me a Christmas card
B	yeah
A	those were the people who were at this is in school oh this is one of er
B	so he doesn't mention anybody in particular then no?
A	he says it's all supposed to be confidential
B	oh I see so he says intelligence is considered to be between fifty to seventy percent inherited according to various observers
A	yeah and then when he talks about some of these that he erm ended in those
B	oh this is funny
A	best cooks yes
B	whilst there may be some truth in this the couple of pedigrees included showing both high and low levels of test intelligence indicating the possible local lack of dominant mediocre genes
A	but we I think we come out as having a fairly that I think that's another one of his is it?
B	yeah
A	yes yes yes no it is
B	gosh
A	so then then we go back oh the
B	yeah
A	I'll take those out
B	sorry yeah
A	some are if I take them out I'll know where they go at least you can turn the pages over properly
B	yeah
A	erm so these go back now but these this is
B	mm I've never been there
A	that is really you know it's so quite something that they lived there
B	yeah
B	so
A	oh no he's an older one
B	oh he's an older one
A	oh he's an older one
B	he's even older he died quite early on by the looks of it
A	yes
B	April the eighteen seventy-nine
A	yes so he's even earlier now then
B	mm number two right there's number two oh that's wonderful I mean you've done an awful amount of work on all of this
A	oh I've
B	it's incredible
A	really it's really
B	it's a very impressive amount of work
A	I enjoyed every minute of it
B	yeah well that's good I can see that you obviously got into it yeah
A	so this is going back now
B	oh wow
A	see if we've got some nice
B	mm
A	you see
B	British judge right
A	but it says
A	so then they
B	wow
A	so these are going back now
B	what's this surname here popping up?
B	yeah
A	no that's really I
B	mm
A	and that's his family
B	mm
A	and let's get to him this one is really lovely because we're related to this man twice
B	oh
A	when I get to him
B	mm mm
A	there it is
B	yeah
A	right so I couldn't get into this place this man was so lovely
B	yeah
A	first of all we're not exactly sure about this but there
B	yeah
A	and we went there and erm we we really thought they they told us all about the the
B	right okay
A	and when
B	right yeah
A	but when his dad bought it he took a farm and that's what it was like
B	wow and where's this
A	so
B	right okay
A	it's all round there
B	I haven't been to
A	so these but these are the
B	right
A	the
B	the
A	and now this one is interesting because this is he's called
B	mm
A	but we're related to him and I don't know if I've got it there's somehow I can show you well we're related to him to him through the
B	mm
A	and when but when you do the
B	mm
A	so we can relate ourselves to
B	wow right
A	but I so he was a Baptist minister and he came up to
A	I yeah in the midlands and I thought ministers were poor
B	mm
A	so the first time we went there we oh that's where he lived at one time then that's the church where he was the minister then erm we tried to work out we thought he lived in this certain house by looking at the census
B	mm
A	and he called his house
B	wow
A	and he was able to find out that the thing I'll show it to you well anyway that's the house he lived in thought and I
B	that's rather nice isn't it?
A	and he he found this which actually proved what I what we had thought yes because it's and it says does it say that somebody
B	mm it says erm
B	yeah
A	and it was called
A	yeah so he lived in there
B	wow
A	but he was very he was interested in local politics and he had shares in the gas
B	in a gas company
A	company yes so er
B	mm
A	but then I wrote to somebody in America who is gosh she's she's I think she's the daughter of
B	wow yeah
A	and she kept in touch with all of these with this isn't that fantastic? he sent all of that
B	it's amazing
A	it was lovely
B	it's like a yeah
A	and that's him
A	yeah
A	anyway it's
B	wow
A	oops sorry yes so and that's all of those
B	the names are quite erm there's a lot of repetition isn't there?
A	yeah the the first son would be named after the grandfather
B	oh right okay
A	so you would find it every other
B	that's the reason why then okay
A	but erm so there's passenger lists here I've got oh these are two people who are mentioned that I might not have put in certain places but I got passage
B	yeah
A	war and erm that's
B	what's this one here
A	oh that's
B	of little that's the next one along
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I did these are people that have got their names mentioned as
B	yeah
A	but they
B	but you haven't been able to slot them into the
A	not quite yes but I must be last one I'll show you then and cos you must be tired
B	yeah
A	now there's two things I wanted to look to see where I had the thing of you
B	you've done an incredible amount of work I feel like I'm in one of those
B	wow
A	now
B	yeah
A	but they're a good one
B	yeah
A	so this is in the eighteen forty there were forty-five household with the name of
B	no see this is it look late of
A	each yes I
B	yes this is the one yeah
A	see this is that this is them so he died then and I've got his death certificate
B	he died in
A	yes yes
B	to be let with immediate possession a house well situated in the above pleasant village of coach house stable close of excellent pasture land extensive orchard gardens late resident was Mr
A	quite right
A	yeah
B	okay so so
A	yes
B	one child
A	and then she married this
B	she was born in
A	so
B	that's erm
A	but that they and I can't erm
B	but you see my grandmother would never have known that
A	no no no
B	she would never have known that yeah
A	but you just think
B	it's very interesting
A	where have they come from and
B	farmers yeah
A	you'd be
B	the veterinary thing is quite
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah and this pleasant house with gardens and orchards
A	yes it's nice see I we've been through and I've looked up the high street but we've never stopped to see if we could work out
B	oh okay
A	where it is
B	at the
A	no this is it it just doesn't
B	no
A	ah this is
B	orchards and pasture
A	so there it just says this is the eighteen forty-one census I think
B	ah yeah it
A	it just says high street so you can't work it out
B	but then it's quite a big plot so it says here
A	yes
B	erm
A	adjoining the
B	two and a half
A	do you
B	a fine growing crop of wheat near the
A	so it's a big plot isn't it?
B	at the back of Mr
A	is that a
B	yeah that one's a pub
A	cos they
A	mm oh you have to go up
B	on the high street yeah
A	and see if you can see something
B	yeah
A	but it's that they really I think ah how can't I get them back to Wales?
B	yeah well yeah why I wonder why not I really wonder why not
A	yes it is quite well it's partly be if if she had been a man it would've been easier to follow and he might have travelled or whatever but but because she married and had children
B	I'll have to take a photograph of
A	oh shall I photocopy it for you?
B	so no no it's okay I'll just honestly I can take a photo with these wonderful Ipads
A	okay then
B	they actually they do come out quite well
A	right cos otherwise I can go and
B	no that's okay that's fine honestly it's erm
A	oh yeah
B	just hold it steady and then I'll
A	there's little bit there what's on this other side? oh that's just telling oh so I've got so that's the eighteen forty-one census then that's I don't know where that's her there oh no
B	mm
A	so
A	is it? yeah
B	yeah
A	just like yeah so erm
B	amazing
A	it's absolutely
B	mm that is really quite a coincidence isn't it?
A	isn't it? yeah
B	or whatever it's called I'm not quite sure if the word's coincidence
A	yeah I mean it really is just
B	what's
A	so just because oh am I not written on this somewhere erm oh yes so all the
B	mm
A	and even those I have found now that they come from
B	mm
A	so it's not many that well they come from
B	yeah
A	really oh this is just of
B	mm
A	so this is
B	that's
A	so it's not far at all and I think all these
B	they are aren't they?
B	wow so yeah so
A	oh yes see yes so
B	mm
A	and then the
B	so where is
A	er well
B	that's a bit further away is it?
A	yes it's it's erm it's quite a way that they moved
B	yeah
A	ah I didn't bring in another map
B	oh that's okay I can have a look on there
A	it's I mean it's it's not far
B	yeah
A	but erm in terms of how they were all
B	so so of course so when you married you became a
A	yes yes
B	so have you looked into your husband's side then?
A	ah yes
B	yeah
A	he's
B	yeah
A	and erm but it's it's very hard because it's really so common in Wales
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but
B	so you haven't been able to get quite as much like
B	right okay
A	he he's his is very academic it's all printed out in order say last generation last generation whereas I have presented them so that you've gone back in each generation and I've taken photographs of where they lived at that time
B	yes that's it yeah
A	but his mother actually came from
B	okay
A	and the records in
B	okay
A	so he's got good he's gone further back on his mother's side than his dad's side
B	right yeah
A	erm but his when you when you do it and you get the records you get a you get a feeling of what the ministers are like
B	right oh I see
A	and what and what society was like because when you go through the christenings and it'll say things like oh erm erm
A	and
B	oh
A	yeah
B	that's a bit of a shock isn't it?
A	well yeah so you see you get a real feeling of what the ministers were like at the time
B	yeah how liberal or or strict they were yeah
A	that's right yeah and that is really great but then the other thing that's very sad is because it being
B	yeah
A	erm or because it's near the coast is when you do the deaths
B	oh right
A	and they'll say er man found on the beach oh that do you know that makes me cry it's like I think I don't know him but how sad somebody has lost him and nobody knows where he is and nobody can kind of
B	yeah so people drowning or something
A	yes yes someone could you know
B	gone overboard
A	over a ship or anything
B	yeah
A	yes yeah but erm they had to go to church really in those days but somewhere amongst that stuff I got that stuff I got a great letter written by a
B	oh yeah
A	about the minister at the time erm oh
B	yeah I I don't know to be honest
A	saint
A	but but the other thing which I think is a real gem is that he only speaks in the language of English and nobody can understand him
A	of course that was his they were at
A	you know and I mean that was why there was a move away in a way because the
B	ah
A	er and so they moved away from the Church of England because they were bringing in the
B	yeah yeah
A	and er that's why I
B	yeah it is great isn't it?
A	and reading all those sort of thing it's er
B	oh wow
A	it's quite
B	it's a gulf of knowledge that you have that's very impressive
A	and there's but there's one in one of them I've written it down and it's not to do with our family but it is somebody
B	ah
A	and that's what was written in the register
B	that's terrible
A	you know it was really
B	buried in the grave like a dog
A	yes yes yes and the way and a Baptist you see because he wasn't Church of England so
B	it's amazing
A	love all those things and some of it I just have to
B	they're amusing little stories as well in a way you know
A	yes yes yes
B	it is a social comment of course yeah
A	oh yeah very much so yes
B	yeah yeah
A	so erm
B	wow it's got it's got me thinking really about the other lot erm the lot that erm so from my mother's side
A	yeah your side yes yes hopefully
B	well I say my grandmother's side I should say
A	yes yeah
B	but they're the erm
A	yes yes yes
B	so yeah well I this is me with my young handwriting so obviously I was getting into it from an early age
B	it's nothing like my handwriting is nothing like that now
A	oh I see yes
B	and granny spent her formative years in
A	yes
B	but erm that would've been my that's
A	actually I can see my father in your mother
B	yeah with the nose absolutely
A	yes but you look like your dad do you?
B	well I have that's that's me
A	yes yes
B	that's actually me unfortunately I don't quite have the nice jaw line as my mum had I've got more of an
A	yes oh no
B	unfortunately
A	yes
B	because she had a lovely jaw line she had a really nice jaw line but yeah from there really I have my granny's nose
A	I see yes
B	erm and I have my dad's eyes

B	and I have granny's forehead and we'll see a bit later on but yeah
A	oh so you've got that photograph
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah I have got that photograph and that must have been you know I suppose somewhere in
A	yes
B	or that might have been
A	oh yes yeah
B	erm that's a different exercise er somebody's wedding
A	oh yes yes
B	yeah these are the
A	they're fantastic photos though aren't they?
B	they are lovely
A	yes
B	they are sweet erm I wonder if there are any
A	yes yes yes yes
B	so you know that we don't lose them
A	that's right
B	but then the idea will be to try to you know start to branch out and do something maybe not quite as
A	well you yes I mean I we've had such fun because we went up to London quite a lot to find out a lot of information
B	yeah
A	and we are mad
B	yeah
A	we actually went to
B	really
A	yes because the Mormons they it's part of their religion that they have to find out so many generations so over the years they've kept different things and at the time
B	yeah
A	you you didn't get it on the internet so we went we went for two weeks and almost every day we went to this record office looking through erm wind up reels
B	yeah
A	and that and and that's
B	wow
A	and I and they got books that you'd never see anywhere
B	right
A	so that was really fantastic
B	yeah
A	but now if there's two organisations there's Find My Past or Ancestry dot com
B	which is the one that's owned by the run by the Mormons?
A	neither of those I don't think
B	right
A	oh yes Family Search I think that's place is called
A	yes
B	you know their religion isn't it? to find
A	yes and we we actually they don't try to proselytise when you go there
B	no okay
A	and we we they were what I would think would be Mormons when in the rooms and then you're their downstairs is like a big place that you can eat
B	ah okay
A	and we'd go down and we'd eat and we'd chat to the Americans but they didn't try to sell their faith to you
B	okay
A	they were really just all about family history you know I found a one thing about the Americans that they do like that their families they want them all to be royal come from royalty
B	of course of course yeah
A	you know they were royals but they were thrown out so they
B	yeah
A	now that's a wild generalisation but they do like it oh my grandma she was you know
A	that kind of business
B	yeah
A	erm but Family Search
B	Find My Past yeah
A	really or Ancestry dot com I mean you have to subscribe to it so you have to make a payment
B	yeah
A	but they've got
B	so they've really got it and is it expensive for the subscription?
A	I don't think it's I can't remember now but it's not that much
B	yeah yeah and why do they want you to subscribe what do you think that's about?
A	well because I suppose they've got they've probably got to pay to put it all in a format
B	right I suppose yeah
A	because it would all have come from the old
B	records yeah yeah
A	so it would be put into a format
B	right okay
A	but they've got erm shipping you know passenger lists things from erm army records and newspapers things I've got on the
B	wonderful
A	and they because they were all out
B	how nice
A	all of the sisters
B	a nice family idea isn't it?
A	mm but but I I the one I've got the best is from my mother's family erm is my grandmother's grandmother and when I was
B	yeah
A	and I can't find him dead so anyway I've actually written it in
A	I think so I think this a bigamist marriage
B	oh god
A	so more recently when the newspapers have come out it's in the newspaper
B	it is you're right
A	and it's it's quite hilarious because it was a
B	say
A	but she actually was found not guilty because he lived he lived about ten miles away from her and they'd lived apart and she didn't know whether he was dead or alive
A	and I know that she knew what she was doing
B	ten miles and she didn't know whether
A	so but the really it's so hilarious though in
B	but she was found not guilty
A	yes
B	ah I say
A	but I've only recently found out since they do newspaper things so
B	that's wonderful oh that's got me very excited
A	it's great we'd loved
B	oh skeletons yeah
A	skeletons and I think well what do you find? because that's life isn't really any different today
B	than it and yeah that's right
A	and I mean they mean illegitimacy er they don't know that I'm illegitimate
B	yeah yeah right yeah yah
A	that's what they mean on the
B	they're looking for scandal
A	yeah and it's
B	yeah
A	when you come across it the
B	okay yeah
A	I've got to say you know they had erm but I think well that happens anyway doesn't it really?
B	yeah yeah
A	but some people are scandalised by it
A	Irish yes
B	you know erm though he doesn't sound at all Irish and he was born in England he was born in
A	no no no mm
B	they all of his family in our background you know my ancestors would be Irish on that side but erm
A	yes
B	the Welsh side of the family
A	yes
B	there is a part of me there and I'm not quite sure what it is yet but it's sort of maybe something more that you know to explore
A	yes
B	because when I grew up in England and we we didn't
A	mm no mm no
B	erm but yeah I think that there is a draw a feeling there's something
A	you will yes yes
B	and now that mum's passed on and gran's passed on and really I've met you which is really fortuitous
A	yes yes yes
B	you know cos this is a link to the family
A	that's right I'm your aunty really
B	that's right you are you know and it's wonderful to have that it really is
A	yes yes yes
B	and to actually have somebody who has really gone to such an incredible you know obviously enjoyed yourself doing it but
A	yes yes yes
B	you know it's an incredible legacy to leave behind
A	yes yes
B	for your children you know and
A	yes yes
B	kind of grandchildren so erm but also yeah it's for others too because it is erm it's an important document
A	yes yes
B	you know documentation
A	yes
B	I love it you know I really do
A	oh that's great yes
B	it does it puts me more in touch with the Welsh side because I knew that there was something in me but
A	mm cos there is yeah
B	not sure what it is you know?
A	yes yeah well I hope you know you must go with your husband to
B	yeah we should go
A	look around some of those places
B	yeah yes definitely
A	and feel that because there is I'm really proud to be Welsh
B	yeah yeah
A	wherever we go I mean
B	well good for you
A	we've lived we've lived here since
B	yes
A	but we do feel very much that we are Welsh
B	very Welsh
A	and we always say oh we're Welsh
B	yes yes yeah
A	erm so it it is a heritage and it's it's lovely and we do come from a really
B	yeah yeah yeah oh well I'm lucky in that respect then
A	erm my feeling yes yes
B	because it's funny because all that I'd heard really from my mum's side granny very rarely talked about
A	mm yes yes
B	but towards the end I asked her about you know her her well I suppose you know her her time with
A	oh yes yes
B	which some would say you know somebody had a nice car in those days
A	yes yes yes
B	you know she loved the horses
A	well yes they did
B	and
B	yeah yeah she loved these horses
A	they yes yes
B	she loved them
A	yes yeah
B	erm and I don't think it was because she married thinking that she'd marry into a wealthy family
A	no no
B	cos I think she actually came from quite a well-to-do family herself
A	yes yes yes yes yeah I wouldn't say they were wealthy but they were
B	yeah comfortable farmers
A	they were well off and especially as I say after the during the war I think it was even better but
B	yeah she these horses just sort of really captured her imagination but
A	yes yes
B	I mean these are just shocking memories now how much over the years she I suppose maybe added to these this childhood memories
A	yes yes
B	but you know whatever her memories were it was unfortunate in a way because I think she carried rather than an anger and a and a hatred for
A	yes
B	and that's got to be one of the most hurtful things as a child
A	yes yes yes
B	she never felt he loved her
A	yes
B	and even though she can sort of rectify the idea or remedy the idea that a man and a woman might fall out of love with each other or not be compatible
A	the man and the woman yes yes yes yes
B	she couldn't ever forgive him I think this is what ate her up for the fact that he he he from an early d
A	yes
B	at all
A	yes
B	but later he sort of maybe grew into the idea of being a father and really wanting to have perhaps the proper kind of love with with her with his one of his you know his children you know
A	yes it it's strange really cos I would say I can talk dispassionately about my father
B	yeah
A	because really my mother's father my grandfather was my father that I the man that I really loved
B	right yes yep
A	erm and felt that he was like a father erm so because I didn't really know my father didn't meet him many times really although well I did meet him at different times and he gave me away when I was married
B	yeah yeah
A	erm he was a nice man I think he was I can quite dispassionately say like I could say about the man next door he was a nice man
B	mm mm
A	and he had lots of interests and I think he was very intelligent but I've got a feeling he and
B	mm
A	and I don't think he they he he didn't want any other children so I think he was a man who would've been better if he'd been erm never had children at all
B	I see yeah right
A	or been a bachelor erm we were when we met him my brother and I erm it would be we'd go to
B	right
A	and he could cope with seeing us for the day
B	right
A	and
B	yeah
A	and we'd have a picnic erm it was and then as we were older erm he was more interested and he was more interested in me
B	yeah
A	than my brother because I had gone on to college and we would talk in the way he liked to talk he was seen to be more interested in
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but then she would have been at university or older by then so I think and they you know he did think a lot of her but I think it was because she was a young woman by then
B	yeah yeah
A	erm so I think probably he was a man better off with
B	mm
A	so whether or not so I don't think it was by accident that they didn't have them because she was young enough
B	mm oh twenty yeah
A	but she can't be many years older than me
B	well that's right
A	really
B	I mean she was twenty when she married him so I think they
A	yes and he was thirty-four fourteen years so
B	yeah
A	so I think erm if that helps you in any way with regard to your mother
B	yeah yeah
A	you can think of him as a nice man
B	yeah yeah
A	but he wasn't paternal
B	no no
A	really when you were older and he could
B	yeah yeah
A	he'd probably love you
A	you know with all your
B	yes yes it's funny how people mm connect on those points yeah
A	but yes yes so erm
B	right well that's good I think that's good it is good to know you know these just fill in some of the details or the blanks because you know for many years I just really got the impression that it was more about mum's feeling toward him
A	mm
B	than myself or
A	yes yes
B	erm but now yeah it's more of the point I guess is that you know it's more about the
A	yes yes that's right yes
B	so it's more about that it's a bigger picture really than just one man
A	yes yes that's right yes
B	one man's decision what he did and what he didn't do
A	so you know I mean I don't really know much about anything because erm it my mother never spoke my mother did love my father
B	yeah
A	all the time until she died even though he was married to
B	yeah gosh that must have been heartbreaking for her
A	erm and she did er but she but she never ever said anything bad about him
B	no
A	erm but she never said anything about why he she began to go out with him when he was married I think that from what I can gather my mother was in the land army
B	mm
A	and she worked on a farm and she lived there and I always got the impression that he was living there at the time
B	mm mm
A	so I'm not sure if she knew too much about your grandmother really so
B	mm probably not yeah two separate lives that way
A	because you know they they yes and they were in different places and it would've been very just their life would've been there really at
B	but there was one question I would've asked my grandmother but I think it was little disrespectful so I didn't ever ask erm that from my understanding to get divorced in those days one would have had a pretty good needed a pretty good reason to get divorced
A	oh yes yes
B	I don't think it's like how it is today just like oh well you know we just sort of don't want there would have to be quite a specific reason
A	yes yes
B	erm and you know most people would say one reason would be adultery that sort of thing
A	yes well it would be yes
B	and erm so but I never asked it because
A	yes well it must have been
B	basically you
A	no really and I mean that's I I don't I don't know if
B	but you you never knew anything about whether that it through all of this I don't suppose the divorce
A	I think you can I think
B	things has come though
A	ah you you can get records of of divorces but they only start at a certain time and I at the time I was doing this in more detail it wouldn't because they don't release records too early they take you know they every
B	yeah they let
A	the censuses only come out every ten years
B	right yeah
A	and it's something like that so I couldn't find a copy of my father's divorce but I'm sure it must have been adultery because I'm not much younger than than your sister your mother
B	yeah yeah that's right yeah
A	so my father was but I'm not sure my mother would have known that he had a child some or perhaps I'm making excuses for her
B	yeah
A	I don't know but it must have been that and it's awful to think that my mother would have been named as the co-respondent
B	well this is it for her reputation
A	yes yes but erm well because it seems such a sort of harsh word somehow
B	it is really yeah
A	and it seems as though you've done something really deliberate I don't know but erm
B	no of course not I wouldn't have seen it like that you know
A	no but she she she never
B	no no I don't I don't think you would yeah
A	erm so I don't know the detail of any of that then
B	no but the one last question then is are you in contact with your brother?
A	oh my brother? yes
B	yeah you are? oh that's good yeah
A	yeah my brother is my brother is my mother's son
B	yeah yeah so that's fine then so you know in that respect you grew up together as sister brother mum
A	oh yes yes yes
B	three of you together
A	and we lived with my grandparents
B	right
A	so erm yes yes
B	yeah yeah oh that's good
A	and and it's really it's so sad really because my mother was afraid she wouldn't say anything and I I had a I
B	okay interesting
A	and erm because they weren't married and
B	yeah
A	and my mother wouldn't have known any better
B	yeah
A	because now you can put the
B	a yeah yeah
A	and erm I thought about it for a long time and then you know when you go through school when you get to the grammar school and that and they took calling bastard is a new word that they all learn and they like I always said I think that's me
B	yeah yeah
A	and I was sixteen when I asked my mother and she told me so it was a you know you just didn't sort of say it and she was really really upset
B	mm
A	erm and and then I had my name changed by deed poll
B	okay
A	erm to
B	yeah yeah
A	and she and she you tell him I said it's not for me it's for you to tell him
B	yeah yeah
A	anyway she never told him and I think it was at oh it was at the funeral of an aunty I think and erm I was talking to my sister-in-law saying something and I thought she
B	oh really?
A	because he always because he said I he knew there was a secret
B	ah
A	and he always thought
B	mm
A	that we didn't have the same father
B	mm
A	he thought that that
B	right
A	well we both were but he he didn't know
B	he got picked up on some sense or something
A	you know and he
B	no
A	they my my grandparents took my mother in
B	mm
A	erm and we and really having nothing but it was like you don't tell anybody sort of thing and I think everybody in the village where I lived believed that my mother was separated and divorced they didn't know that she was never married
B	yeah which I suppose even then separation and divorce would have been considered to be quite a thing to gossip about
A	oh would have yes a thing that's right yeah absolutely
B	you know so but then she would have had to have gone quite through a lot of
A	yes yes so er
B	heartache
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	but I think I think
B	what to protect her?
A	no to get out
B	oh really
A	I don't know my mother had dementia in her last years and we were visiting her and she just used to talk about she talked a load of rubbish erm but she would say things and she oh god what have I done wrong now what I have done wrong now cos I think cos the way you brought there was religion was really quite it was very much about doing wrong in those days
B	yeah yeah
A	and erm she thought I was born with spina bifida because of what she did
B	okay
A	because she'd had me without being married
B	okay
A	and then so we were there one day and she said why did she send me away? why did she send me away from the farm? I didn't do anything wrong so from that I think that
B	okay yeah
A	initially and then my then my grandmother found out and said you've got to come home
B	yeah
A	you know erm so I I
B	gosh that's tough
A	myself I I'm not all that keen on this promiscuous society that there is
B	yeah yeah no
A	but I do think it's much better to be honest about things you know all these secrets and I can't help you with you know what happened with your mother and my father because I my mother never said you know like my daughter said I can't believe you you believed your mother that there wasn't room in the house
B	yeah that's it but you know but why not it's easier to believe that than to believe anything else
A	that's right yes yes yes
B	you know so
A	so erm but it is
B	and it really revolves around well I suppose you know cos my
A	or your grandmother rather yes
B	never remarried again so we we never had so it sort of to me it sort of revolved a a lot around
A	yes yes
B	failed marriage so erm so really seeing that all guns were pointed at
A	mm yes
B	and er and that's the way I've been brought up you know
A	mm yes
B	but as I say now really it's kind of like well that's one man in a in a in a you know in a tapestry of lives
A	yes that's right yes yes
B	that are interwoven together throughout the centuries
A	absolutely that's right yes yes yes so
B	yeah but some of the themes the thematics that come through I think are quite interesting you know erm I've picked up on a few things today where I sort of I suppose people say oh I wonder why I'm like this or I wonder why I'm interested in that or
A	oh yes yes
B	you know I wonder where that came from and you know some people would say yes it can be something in the family that sort of you know encouraged
A	well it is yes yes
B	more than something else you know
A	but no there are some things that are genetic really that have come through yes yes
B	mm
A	yes yes so
B	well it's been really wonderful
A	oh it's been lovely meeting
B	we'll have to do it again
A	yes yes you must
B	well I'll have to show you my my my budding little foray to try to do some of my own
A	yes yes
B	cos they're all Welsh as well you see all the
A	that's right well if you need any kind of yes yes
B	all that lot so
A	yes so er yeah no no that would be er
B	that would be nice to do it again yeah
A	yeah and
B	yeah yeah
A	that's actually
B	oh that would be something cos I'm sure I'll get stuck
A	yes well that's right yes no it's been really really lovely and I have to say before you go
B	oh gosh
A	so that's why we didn't invite you to lunch
B	oh gosh no oh dear
A	so really but he's keeping he's quite
