A	so you were telling me what about work your new job or your old job for three years
B	yeah well it's three years now I've been working at that job yeah so lots of things I prefer erm lots some things I don't so I spent nearly twenty years being self employed so the transition from going from being self employed to being employed was actually mm in some ways difficult and some ways easy erm so that was suddenly having to be at the most difficult was having to be at my desk at eight o'clock every morning I hated that cos that's the latest you can start at
B	and you know sort of all of those sort of things actually I don't miss that at all erm but I do miss a little bit of the flexibility of the job you know so you know if I suddenly wanted to have a hence you probably haven't seen me so much because I just can't stop because I can't stop and have a coffee morning or stuff like that that I used to
D	no cos when when you're self employed you can organise it to suit yourself can't you?
B	yeah exactly
D	it's just whatever suits you and if you want to take time off that's fine
B	yeah exactly well I mean I used to just plug out my diary and nobody used to know what I was doing
D	no
B	really it was up to me and if I said somebody rang up and said oh do you want erm you know can you can I have an appointment then? and if I looked up no I'm having coffee with
D	I wish I could have persuaded
B	er well erm yeah I'll I'll erm I mean and it's interesting I found I was very I was not very confident about doing doing that to start with when I first started but I gradually got better and better at realising that actually if you said you couldn't do it it doesn't mean to say they're gonna run away to somebody else they've often
D	yeah I can't do it then
B	exactly
D	not that I can't do it at all
B	I can't do it at all exactly right so in the end I erm I got more confident erm about just saying to people well erm and if it was really really the only time and I was gonna lose out on that then in the end I used to say okay well let me go and speak to the person concerned see if I can move that and come back to you I'd ring you up and say
B	can't make that coffee can you make it another time
D	see this is something that annoyed me intensely with
B	yeah
D	consecutive days and not not just saying even if it wasn't true not just saying I can't do that day I'm already booked the number of times I
B	do it mm
D	if you had something else booked you couldn't do it
B	that's right
D	mm
B	it takes years I was surprised he didn't didn't eventually get to that stage because I got forced into it on a number of occasions because it was things that the children wanted to do I was involved with something at school or something like that and I really really wanted to be there and they were sort of non negotiable really
D	mm
B	in terms of well if I lose that contract I lose it because it's actually more important to me that I'm there for the children but then what I started to realise that actually as you said it isn't wasn't that I didn't want to do it at all it was just that I couldn't do it at that time the more I erm said I can't I'm sorry I that I'm actually doing something that day I'm already booked is it possible how about this and that and the other?
D	mm yeah
B	I was surprised how often you know ninety-five percent of the time people were yeah of course that's fine
D	yeah yeah course they're in the same position often themselves so once they
B	I know
D	got to make a
B	but he never got to that stage
D	oh well he did from time to time he was just so annoying the number of times be couldn't be somewhere because
B	mm well we all do that on occasions I wonder if he looks back and regrets that now?
D	I don't think he'd regret it but he certainly doesn't miss it
B	yeah
D	erm yeah he went off last week
B	mm yeah
D	no it's gone it's over he not not pining for it at all
B	yeah yeah I know it's interesting but I think that's actually quite an important thing I was talking about that with a I've made one particular friend at
D	mm
B	in terms of that in terms of er work erm and it's quite interesting when you start to review that and I really like my job and I really like the people I work with and I really like I cos of the nature of the job I'm involved with a lot of people across the whole group and they're all really nice people
A	so what what exactly do you do
B	so I am responsible for all the education liaison that the company does so at the moment there is an enormous erm shortage of engineers in the UK so my role is to work with schools universities put events on and increasingly work with er at government level on this issue around shortage of of erm engineers so it's sort of divided into quarters really erm in those four areas so it's because
A	that's quite nice though isn't it?
B	so that was one of the reasons that actually decided I decided to take it in the first place because of the fact it was a bit like being your own boss because there was nobody else looking over you you could actually build it from scratch
D	and nobody saying well so and so always used to do it this way
B	absolutely
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah so starting with that that was actually quite a refreshing thing to have actually that nobody else had done it before but it equally it was quite erm daunting
D	mm
B	because you had to sort of erm prove yourself if you see what I mean
D	and the other side of that is you didn't have somebody else's experience to draw on or anybody to ask
B	exactly exactly I didn't have anybody else's experience to draw on and erm so I had to sort of build it up for myself and and the first two weeks I was there the person I report into
D	mm
B	and again I can't cope with
D	mm
A	so do you yeah
B	no I don't do any training anymore the bit that I miss I do a little bit of it but of the bit that I miss is the coaching and at one point I was actually doing some training for erm they
A	do help yourselves
D	mm very nice
B	there's going to be a lot of crunching in this
A	that's alright
B	erm
A	fairly healthy stuff
B	erm so
A	who doesn't like celery?
B	no I quite like celery
D	I'm fine
B	I like celery just had some in a salad actually well it's great celery because it's supposed to
A	sorry?
B	isn't it doesn't it consume more calories to digest it than it does actually have in it all together? I think
D	that's the theory yeah
B	that's the theory yeah but whether it actually works or not
D	erm so yeah so anyway so that's basically what I do
A	so are you dealing with all the universities and?
B	yep
A	so what do you have to actually do?
B	oh well I build up the relationships with them so that now we're doing things like
A	but you're happy?
B	mm
A	and what who who locally works there there must be a lot of people you know?
B	mm there's quite a lot yeah but you'd be surprised how far
D	it's not very much further really than living here and working in Bristol
B	no it isn't
D	or a lot of those places it just seems
B	a lot of people
B	live in
D	yeah
B	a lot of people live in Bristol
D	mm
B	lives in Bristol now erm
D	does he?
B	he's done he's the the he's in his third year he's at of his apprenticeship
D	really?
B	mm
D	his third year of his apprenticeship?
B	he's finally finally found something he loves
D	and how many how many years is it altogether?
B	four
A	cos I thought he was working with erm
B	no that was ages ago
A	was it?
B	mm he went away after that from there he went away to erm Canada and worked for six months er doing a summer season in
B	erm but most of the time he was alright and then he came back and erm as he as he was coming back I
A	oh sounds very mature
B	I don't believe this and I'm trying to decide what I want to do and I've decided what I want to do is do an engineering apprenticeship I couldn't believe it
A	mm
B	and he applied for loads of different ones
D	mm
B	I had to step away
D	yeah
B	from it completely so I erm I I didn't get involved and when and said to him well I can give you some support for you know interview training I mean I when I think about the kids in
A	do you see him every day? do you see?
B	no I don't see him at all cos he works in a completely different side
A	oh
D	how nice
A	so where where's he living?
A	oh
B	got a lovely flat there with
A	oh that's nice
B	and he's very happy
A	brilliant and what's
B	mm
B	she started a new job today
A	did she?
D	oh
B	mm yeah well
D	so what's she doing?
B	that's why I was a bit late cos I was having I was hearing about the first day which is a horrendous start cos she ever she got to to Clapham South tube station to discover both the Northern and the Victoria lines were down and erm she had to run all the way to Wandsworth Common to pick up a train which she just missed the train that was in she got the wrong ticket oh it was just unbelievable the things but she got Victoria she had to get a taxi there was a lot of traffic I mean it was just a nightmare I how she managed to only be five minutes late I still don't know but anyway she a the gym manager and erm she looks so she manages this gym and she also does a lot of erm er sports therapy treatments and it looks like from tonight she's also side it looks like she's gonna be doing er Pilates you know Pilates class as well cos she's a trained Pilates teacher in a company
D	mm sounds it
B	she's treating the editor of close
A	and and she lives in London?
B	yep yep that so three weeks ago she moved back to London so yeah she's fine she left London a year ago had six months in
A	where's
B	Austria
A	mm
B	lovely place we went up to see her in February it's really nice I've been talking an awful long time
D	well we can't talk about your job
B	no true well we can talk about you though
D	what do my children do? erm I say
B	oh wow
D	which was the whole point of getting a house
B	oh was it?
D	well to hear her talk yes and it's got a cat flap so that's alright
B	oh a long time isn't it?
A	where did she meet
D	she met him through er
A	gosh
D	but he was he's been a very good friend all the way through school of a lad who's her very best friend from school who also went to tae kwon do and the three of them have been living together for the last two years so they're all
D	as though he was a cat or something so erm yeah they're they're very settled so they're like an old married couple she's in charge
B	well
B	do you think they will get married?
D	I don't know I think I was talking about this to
B	oh
D	erm and you know would have thought perhaps he was would be the one who would want to back away whereas she's got us and
B	I think
D	had an arrangement with a friend who's going to wear a hat at the wedding for me if they do get married
B	I think sometimes as well they they just they don't need to anymore do they?
D	no
B	and I think sometimes maybe is she wants children she might start thinking differently about it or she might not
D	mm I mean even then people very often don't do they? there's just legal implications and complications and
B	yes yes that's the only thing you yeah yeah that's the only thing isn't it?
D	but erm yeah she seems to be fine settled and if only I could say the same about
B	did he find some accommodation? cos I
D	he did
B	oh good
D	yes
B	I am pleased on that day?
D	cos yes well the following day yes he's gone he's gone up back up to London today because there's something he has to do at the university tomorrow but he's not too sure what cos the timetable's all a bit vague but he has to be in tomorrow but he doesn't know why but he's going anyway
A	so is he studying at the moment?
D	mm
A	what's he studying?
D	he's doing film production at
A	oh right
D	and unfortunately
A	and what year is he in?
D	well he's just finished his
B	ah there's a story to that
D	oh well he's just finished his second year he's just starting his second year they they want him to repeat the year er now he says it's purely because back just before Easter he went to a party where somebody accidentally broke a window and
B	well I know that's the problem when they're responsible and you can't it's not like being at school when you can ring up the teacher is it and ask?
D	he I mean he swears he he gave it all in and they yeah they have no record of it so so he's repeating his second year and er he's got somewhere to live and it all seems a bit more positive now so he's not snarling at me at the moment
B	well maybe in the long run it will be better for him
D	in some ways it could well be because I think he probably needs a bit of a jolt to to make him realise that it's not just plain sailing and he can't just coast along and he's gonna be with a bunch of people that he perhaps wouldn't have been with
B	well I think I think it they need a sort of failure in life don't they sometimes?
D	mm yeah
B	I think erm I think because of the type of parents that we've been all of us have been much more protective of our kids than certainly I experienced as a as a child you can
D	well yeah you do don't you? if if you want to help you want to sort them out that's what we're here for
B	that's right but the thought of my parents ever I mean I think it was I think it was just a completely different style of parenting I mean my parents didn't I mean they cared very much for me
D	mm
B	and we had a very good relationship but it was just different
D	well I I mean I don't know how true it is with other people but I was the first person in my family to go to university my parents had no understanding
B	yeah
D	of what was involved and so fine you know it was up to me to get on and do the A levels and so on whereas we've done it we've been there we've got the experience that we want to pass on and and help whereas our parents my parents didn't have the expertise or the knowledge
B	yeah
D	er so it's just sort of get on and do it which in some ways is probably better because you haven't you didn't then have parental pressure
B	no
D	encouraging you trying to
B	no because my parents didn't know yeah absolutely they didn't know you know I remember them I remember my mother saying is something about parents evening you going? my mum used to say well no I don't think so I don't think I'm a bit tired tonight I don't think I'll bother
B	and I'm thinking and I remember this distinctly because I'm thinking I would never have done that always I've turned up at parents evening
B	yeah
D	but you know one of them my dad went if he could er but certainly somebody always went
B	but you know when I
D	I can remember one occasion at
D	well we had an exchange over the wall she alright? yeah she's fine
B	yeah it's interesting isn't it? how it all how different it is but erm no I mean I just remember well I didn't go to university
D	well they didn't have it
B	or they didn't have it that's right they didn't have it whereas my daughter rang yesterday and said oh mum I'm gonna really struggle to pay the rent this month could you pay this month's and then I'll
B	as I paid last month's
D	mm
B	as I was had to be a guarantor I did say to her I really do think at twenty-seven that I'm actually fed up with this now I don't think I really wanna do this anymore she sort of looked at me and said mm yes no you're probably right
D	well if they're renting there's always got to be a guarantor now
B	well there hasn't if you've got a permanent job
D	right yeah
B	but she's always messed around doing this that and the other but hopefully she will be so the next one
B	not
B	she's done her two degrees and that's
D	suppose they'll all get there in the end
B	one hopes so
D	mm
