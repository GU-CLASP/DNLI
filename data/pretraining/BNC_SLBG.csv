B	did we buy it in erm in er after September?
C	yes yeah I think it was around September time
B	okay
C	but
A	just looks like a big tub of stuff
C	they're quite tough on like if they think it's in any way not not their fault then they won't
C	mm
A	now it was her own fault she was using it
C	mm
A	but
A	like if if there's a big brick through it or
D	yummy
C	mm okay

A	I've no idea I can't remember at all but you can find out in five minutes
C	did you? did you buy it in?
A	can't remember
D	mm
C	cos we could check on each bank account
B	you're the one who
A	doesn't doesn't matter all you've gotta do is go
C	the tag that's on the bottom?
A	yeah there'll be a Dell service tag you just type that in and it'll tell you all about it when it was bought
C	okay okay alright I'll do that then
B	I'll do that today
A	we can do it in a minute

D	bye bye bye
C	oh it's a nice thing to get some different food down there
A	so you've got chips chicken raspberry and you're starting with the chips and the chicken?
D	mm
C	I know we try with other stuff
A	raspberries and grapes
C	raspberries yeah
A	I would've got grapes but they didn't have any
D	mm
C	raspberries are fine aren't they?
B	so er let's just say it was under a year and they said yeah we can
A	no it means they'll come collect it take it away fix it and give it back to you
B	and what space of time does that happen?
A	could take a couple of weeks
C	mm
A	the other alternative is you just to leave it broken so
B	okay it's just I'd like to have it in er England
C	I think that's just the lesson you've gotta learn
D	yummy yummy
C	I mean it's
D	mm
C	and you don't have to pay for it I'd count yourself lucky
D	mm
B	I know
A	what did you actually do?
B	well I went to move it onto the desk thing next to my bed but I didn't pick it up from the bottom I picked it up from the top like that
B	and I took it over I'm pretty sure I just pressed too hard
A	you pressed it hard?
B	too hard not like that like at the top left of the thing
B	and I picked it up and I put it right on my desk and I must've pressed it too hard really
A	it didn't fall out of your hands while you were moving it or anything?
B	no
C	I can imagine that might've done if you'd like cos they're not really supposed to be pressed at all are they?
D	mummy mum mum mum mum mumma
C	what's that?
B	didn't
B	and then just a a black outline where my hand was
B	appeared and then it went all glitchy and then just went black
C	it must've been your hand mustn't it?
B	mm
D	yummy
A	it should be more resilient than that
C	you know in a way I know you did wanna take it away with you
D	oh oh
C	in one way the the potential for it to get damaged as well when you're away
D	mummy

C	yeah
B	yeah it's just that I don't really want it on the floor cos
B	what? erm oh
A	mm is this the first thing that came up?
B	one second it's loading something
A	where where did you go?
A	okay
B	it did come up
B	it did and it had loads of options and I said
C	very loud
D	dad mum
C	country park
D	daddy
D	oh
C	yeah

B	you should be able to
A	twenty fifteen
D	mummy mummy mummy
A	so
C	yes mummy
D	mum oh

B	so it should be
C	if if they agree
A	well they're not psychics so they're not gonna come along and just
A	but kind of like yes of course you do
A	is there
B	wind
A	that noise
B	wind against the door closing the door
A	upstairs? in your room? okay from the windows
B	yeah
A	is there any back up power?
B	yeah
A	then why don't
B	you
D	mummy mummy
B	could you hear it?
D	mummy mummy
C	you just stuffed those all into your mouth?
D	mummy
C	mummy yes
A	er that's not the way I
B	can you hear it?
A	isn't there supposed to be a light there?
B	no
A	no?
B	there's never any light I don't know what you're on about
A	okay come here can you hear it?
D	hello
A	so where did you?
B	usually there's a light
B	yeah
B	where your hand was
D	mm
A	but anything unusual
C	is that finished?
B	see that's that's where it was right there
A	yeah but the good thing is there's no other signs of damage right?
B	mm
A	and it seems
B	it is definitely damaged though
A	which means yeah but there's no visible signs of damage there's nothing on this when that's when they'll go oh you damaged this yourself
B	I dunno
A	you know what I mean? you can see it
B	I can see er look if you look there you can see a
A	yeah but look the thing is it er the only thing now is that we can't shut it down or if you close it it'll shut down?
B	or you can just press that down
A	okay
C	will they? and so what erm do we need to provide our evidence
A	because the service tag is still there it's they know from the service tag when the warranty's up
C	yeah
A	so they won't really give a crap like they'll have the address of the warranty anyway so it's er
C	yeah
C	yes
C	erm I don't know see you
A	cos sometimes I get stuff delivered
C	yeah
A	well you were here so it would've got come sent to here
B	you were the one who found the laptop
C	I think I think it came here
A	mm cos er sometimes I'd send it to erm
C	mm
A	it's probably I probably just
C	yeah
A	but anyway they won't like if you had the laptop that's good enough for them
C	yeah
A	erm
C	so what do we do now? do we can we do it now? just or is a bit more long
B	the sooner the better really
D	hello
C	down?
C	you know what down is down?
B	to call them?
A	it would be easier to just you'd probably be able to
A	I tell you what
B	what?
A	write down the bloody tag underneath and just give it to me
B	okay
A	no
D	hello hello
C	yeah cos it's
C	just for the help
D	yay
C	yeah
D	mm
B	thank you
A	mm
B	okay
C	are you sure you don't mind doing it?
A	doing what?
C	okay
A	the laptop is on but the screen
C	yeah
A	to make it all simple
C	okay
A	they are very good they are very good well er like
A	it'll be ten minutes or else telling you to ring them and I'll
C	okay
A	stuff can get quite hard to find on their site
C	okay
A	but erm
C	yeah
A	they'll come back to you they'll try to sell you an extended warranty it's generally they'll try and sell you two years
A	probably around two hundred euros now that's half the price of the laptop nearly so
C	yeah
A	it is quite steep you've gotta be
C	yeah
A	it's when the kids have them and they
C	yeah you
A	they can overheat them and er like
C	you take care of them though don't you?
A	like it's just
C	yeah and then they kind of just leave them on in the blankets that's the
A	I've told them a million times
C	mm
A	is that a
A	what?
B	here's the service tag and sorry for not saying thank you
A	thanks
B	mm
B	mm
C	okay I could always take a picture of it with my phone
A	this is written down you could always
B	no I can just
A	okay say hello to
C	well he'll be he'll be with his dad then and they'll be er like they're going on like three holidays so
C	it's quite soon really the first of July so it's a week and a half I think
C	Wednesday I think
C	Iceland
A	yeah
C	and kind of two by the sea in England I think somewhere just somewhere nearish
A	uhu
C	so it's not really like they're er and it'll often not be near wifi and that kind of thing
C	and obviously
C	well the thing is he probably won't
A	I mean it's a moot point now cos they won't be able to collect it and fix it in time by the time he goes anyway so
C	yeah
A	well it's unlikely
C	yeah yeah I think some the things
A	well
A	had to get hers
C	they were in warranty were they?
A	yeah they tried to sell me extra warranty for two hundred euros
C	mm
A	no
D	mum mummy mummy
A	mm
D	oh
C	he's starting to behave more like a
A	person?
C	like a normal like a more average
C	yeah
A	say hello to who?
D	mm?
C	hello?
B	hello
C	put my arm up
B	hello
C	he probably wants me to give him some chips
C	yeah
A	or maybe we could just try and put him to bed with no bottle
A	what? oh no I'm not saying it's not good for him
C	yeah
A	er but
A	give him the bottle later
B	yeah?
D	yeah
