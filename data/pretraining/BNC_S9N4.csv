A	it's just silly isn't it you know?
B	yeah um
A	you wouldn't do this
A	yeah
B	um what it
A	mm
B	it's just unfortunate really now that
A	yeah
B	he was the chairperson
A	mm
B	um you know he was and er there's something called planning and countryside officer
A	mm
B	er and um particularly if they're out of town you know he he used to get involved in that to see whether there were any potential problems with footpaths and stuff
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	it was just dipping
B	it was nineteen point seven or something
B	it had just gone below but it's kicked er
A	yeah
B	it's kicked in now
A	oh good
B	um
A	yeah it's feeling warm
B	so he'd be the ideal person but of course he's not on the committee and I don't really
A	mm
B	feel I should give um this woman his number cos you know he he's tricky
A	she'll be forever calling him
B	well he's another one who does a lot of voluntary work
A	mm
B	he does hospital runs
A	oh right
B	and I mean he he's over seventy now but he takes um older people or you know people who are less mobile than he is
A	mm
B	um to
A	oh
B	scheme that er
A	what in his own car?
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	you know as expenses
A	yeah
B	to take people
A	mm
B	and um er I er you know he he would've been an ideal person cos
A	mm
B	it's not that
A	mhm
B	but um
A	mm
A	mm
B	you've got
A	yeah
B	which is called
A	mm
B	so he's stopped being er on the committee of our group which is
A	right
B	but he's on the committee of the er area group which is called
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	the er the person who could do it very well is somebody called
A	mm
B	who used to work on the county council
A	oh right
B	on the county council
unknown_female	right I'm gonna pop up the pharmacy
B	yeah
A	alright
unknown_female	be back in a bit
B	you alright? Yeah
A	see you in a bit
B	um and they er outsourcing you know when they
A	oh right
B	you know councils outsource so much work these days
A	mm
B	and when
A	mm
B	er presumably knew her knew about her offered her a job
A	mm
B	which was outsourced because she was retiring
A	mm
B	so the company to whom it was outsourced got in touch with her and said would you be prepared to do your job but for us?
A	oh
B	and that's what she's doing
A	nice
B	doing it
A	yeah
B	um so therefore she's another one
A	mm
B	one
A	mm
B	and
A	oh right
B	so
A	yeah
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	and in fact I'm seeing him after Wednesday cos we're going on a a reccy
A	you and
B	yeah
A	oh that'll be nice
B	he's doing a walk er in about er Monday morning walk you know sort of short walk
A	mhm
B	um so he's doing that um in a couple of weeks time
A	mm
B	so um yeah it er yeah so I I had the my er sort of
A	and it went okay?
B	yeah
A	you got there alright?
B	we hired a little
A	mm
B	but there's a woman called
A	oh right
B	which means she
A	mhm
B	and she gets paid for what she does
A	oh right
B	um and in addition and she's a member of our group
A	mm
B	doesn't get paid for that
A	mm
B	or they're young people
A	yeah
B	um they go to her
A	mm
B	so when I cycled over
A	mm
B	she you know
A	oh right
B	um and she likes to match you know men with men and women with women sort of thing
A	mm
B	and she's always driven her own
A	mm
B	but um when I got there they hired a coach had hired a coach
A	oh that's a good idea of doing it
B	well
A	so who drove then?
B	um well they
A	they get a driver or?
B	yeah they hired it with the driver
A	mm
B	um because in addition to the sort of I mean there's in terms of the um helpers
A	mm
A	mm
B	but she couldn't go
A	oh right
B	at
A	oh yeah
B	so there's four of us er
A	oh
B	um with their families and who else was there? Oh yeah there's a woman er I would say in her forties who doesn't like groups
A	oh right
B	she's a bit intimidated by groups which is  which is  fine you know
A	mm
B	I don't like groups either
A	no
B	um so she came along
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	in their area
A	mm
B	in their parish church
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	so it's to give them an idea of what happens in the diocese
A	mm
B	of person who are seeking you know information about the Church
A	mhm
B	as I was er when I um was received
A	mhm
B	and the ones who are not baptized are called catechumens
A	mm
B	that's an old sort of technical word
A	mm
B	and the ones that already are baptized er are called candidates
A	mm
B	male or female
A	mm
B	his deputy er er on official on the official level
A	mhm
B	you know on a sort of civic and pageantry level um er is it's quite strange actually
A	right
B	he sends the vicar general
A	he nominates him
B	okay
A	mhm
B	you know steps down or whatever then the vicar general becomes the administrator
A	so he's now an administrator?
B	yeah
A	why vicar? Cos
B	anyway his
A	isn't vicar an Anglican term?
B	er
A	it's not a Catholic term
B	yeah well I  I think  I think you they er I think it's interchangeable now I think
A	oh right
B	I think it is
A	mm
B	catholic Church
A	mm
B	um
A	okay
B	so um
A	so who was he sort of
B	so he
A	taking the mass then?
B	yeah
A	celebrating the mass
B	well it's the service rather than a mass
A	oh right
B	church
A	mm
B	and there's liturgy
A	oh okay
B	um
A	mm
B	at
A	oh okay
B	um but er the two er people that came with the woman who's thinking about joining the Church er when it came to going up er to see um
A	mm
B	anyway
A	mhm
B	and the catechumens er who are if he decides to er be received at
A	mhm
B	easter
A	mm
B	he has the three sacraments
A	mhm
B	whereas the remainder have um er confirmation and Eucharist
A	mhm
B	and sometimes in fact I think we've got one this year we've got a lapsed Catholic who you know has been er away if you like from
A	mm
B	um er er sacraments and things like that of the Church for a long time
A	mhm
B	um and in the past when she was practising so to speak
A	yeah
B	she was receiving er the Eucharist
A	mm
B	um but they do er
A	oh that's interesting
B	so this year we'll have at least one person er who is um to be baptized
A	mm
B	in fact some of the I think one of the teenagers was a catechumen as well
A	mm
B	to be baptized
A	mm
B	and this woman who will um because she's received that already don't
A	yeah absolutely
B	well strangely not
A	rather than just started up again
B	she seems quite well sort of informed really
A	oh
B	she's a nurse and
A	okay
B	she's a um I think she's a nurse I can't remember is she a nurse
A	mhm
B	or she's a nurse in a er of for people who are mentally um disabled in some way
A	mm
B	mentally impaired in some way
A	mm
B	um
A	yeah
B	um
A	right
B	she's gonna get the other two
A	mm
B	this one is baptized and confirmed in the Catholic faith
A	mhm
B	and she just sort of a refresher really
A	mm
B	but she um she
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's just I wonder if she had like a crisis of faith or
B	maybe
A	life got in the way or
B	I mean like people people leave the Church for all sorts of reasons don't they?
A	mm
B	but um
A	it's just interesting if you were
B	yeah
A	to come back
B	mm
A	the classes if you
B	yeah
A	you know if you weren't sure I suppose
B	yeah it's very anyway
B	so we've got a bit of a
A	you've got a real mixed bunch
B	mixed bunch really
A	yeah
B	I mean there were some that couldn't go
A	mm
B	but after being married for a while you know like me er they decided they would
A	mm
B	the they want so the they they've come to our group but they're also talking to one of the younger
A	oh yeah
B	er no he's actually not a Benedictine
A	oh
B	his name's Father
A	uh-huh
B	but he's a Dominican
A	mm
B	stuff
A	mm
B	um
A	oh and he
B	yeah
A	do they not have a church there?
B	well I think what it is they do but I think he's on loan because
A	he's on loan
B	in the sense that um we've got
A	you're down a priest
B	one full-time priest
A	mm
B	well I don't think we're down a priest
A	well who took over from Father
B	er
A	um
B	er Father
A	father
B	yeah
A	that's it
B	um
A	mm
B	studying in the university
A	oh okay
B	but they're only here whilst they're studying
A	yeah
B	um
B	so I mean I dunno whether you've whether you can actually fully retire as a priest or not
A	mm
B	um
A	mhm
B	and Father
A	mm
B	now Father
A	is he?
B	and he's had some he had a really strange well not strange
A	tut ff
B	and they had to cut away quite a lot of his foot
A	huh
B	he he wears a special sort of shoe now that's sort of built up so that
A	oh
B	er I wonder how he managed to do that
A	had he been on a pilgrimage somewhere?
B	well  er whether  er whether
B	that or he had bad circulation and you know it was much worse than he thought
A	how do you get in the  in the  Western world how do you get
B	I dunno how he I dunno how you get that
A	gangrene?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he couldn't  he couldn't  stand and er and do the things that priests do when they stand up
A	mm
B	um and now he um he's back to you know celebrating mass in a  in a  in the normal way
A	mm
B	but I imagine he probably had to cut back on a lot of things
A	yeah
B	so we have this um Father
B	his name's
B	not a Benedictine
B	um and er he's shown as a resident priest but he's certainly associated with
A	ah
B	mm
A	so um so what kind of font does
B	um it's
A	is it a small one like the stand that they had at St
B	yeah
A	is it in the traditional sort of base and stand? Rather than like a hole in the ground?
B	yeah it's it's basic I mean basically they don't they they what they tend to do is make it up on the sanctuary
A	oh right
B	so it's so that er they can tip water in it
A	mm
B	in front of everybody
A	oh okay
B	um and but for children I think there is one and I think it's at the back of the church
A	mm
B	side aisle
A	mm
B	I think it's the first opening
A	oh okay
B	it's the there's often a screen up
A	yeah
B	um but I think if you look beyond the screen you can see um the font in there
A	mm
B	er Vigil is a big thing they do it all at the front by the altar
A	oh right
B	um
A	mm
B	it wouldn't have the same effect really
A	yeah
B	Cos it is a  it is a  community you know parish
A	mm
B	you know you want everybody at at mass to see what's going on
A	yeah
B	yeah people
A	member of the parish
B	who are being received into the Church
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	or or one or none
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	so yeah
A	oh
B	er
A	mm
B	the woman on the phone
A	mm
B	and I said oh er thinking it was a Saturday I said oh yeah I'm sure I can
A	mm
B	and I thought she was just telling me because er I haven't been turning up much on Saturdays
B	which is rather strange cos although she one of
A	yeah
B	you know she produces she puts them all together
A	mm
B	um obviously what she does is e-mails them to me so I can put them on the website
A	mm
B	um and I should know when the AGM was
B	last week a er at the um walks programme on on the website to see that the um AGM um was yesterday
A	oh
B	so I had to phone up
B	um I told you I will be going I won't be going
A	oh dear
B	so it's another year
A	was she alright?
B	so I'm sure I will get mentioned in the
B	in the minutes
A	absentee
B	yeah
A	hm
B	I mean I if you know it depends really well it
A	mm
B	and I don't wanna drive half-way across the
A	well no
B	on a Sunday
A	not in an evening particularly
B	yeah
A	do you not
B	during the day
A	oh is it? Right
B	it's er yeah it's
A	oh okay
B	so so it sort of starts at ten um if you're going you know if they  if they  got the walk first
A	mm
B	you go for ten
A	mm
B	um if you only wanna go to the AGM you get there at two er
A	oh okay
B	and don't go on the walk
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	all
A	oh blimey
B	and er where they the place where they'd chosen I can't for the life of me remember what it's called now it's where they've got
A	right
B	you probably won't have heard of it but it's
A	no
B	you know bird-watchers know all about it
A	right
B	um it's at this particular swannery
A	hm
B	um but I tried to get there and the roads were closed off
A	mm
B	er they obviously knew the area better than me and you know found other ways to get there
A	mm
B	it was near Wisbech
A	oh right
B	um yeah so
A	so do you
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and and I have to go there because obviously I'm
A	you're the treasurer
B	I'm the treasurer and the publicity officer so
A	mm
B	so I
A	do you
B	I can't get out of that
A	do you not need to prepare anything for the area one?
B	well
A	you're not the treasurer for the area one then?
B	no I'm not the treasurer for the area
A	so you don't need to do anything
B	and I'm not the publicity officer
A	mm
B	so all they do is the reports that we prepare for our group ones
A	mm
B	are just  are just  bolted in
A	mm
B	to the um area report
A	oh fine
B	um the only person that actually has to do something is
A	mm
B	she has to go and you know talk about what the group's done and you know what
A	mm
B	we've been doing and what our plans are for the future and that sort of stuff
A	is this the first year she's taken over from David?
B	no
A	or second year?
B	no she's she wants to step down
A	oh yeah you did say that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no she's agreed to stay on cos nobody wants to do it
A	mm
B	Cos in the past
A	it's a commitment
B	they
A	you'll you'll be the entire board
B	well um it was before I was treasurer
A	mhm
B	they wanted me to do it and I said no I'm I'm quite happy being publicity officer
A	yeah
B	um you know I I don't know how many years you're supposed to do these things
B	for as many years as you want to but
A	yeah
B	you know you just get a bit fed up with it after a while
A	well yeah
B	um
A	with the website
B	yeah
A	it's a bit of a hassle
B	and I've been  I've been  treasurer for two years now
A	mm
B	Cos I've done two AGMs
A	mm
B	so I think you it'll get to the stage where I'll just get fed up with it and er you know I'll go on the odd walk but
A	mm
B	I'll get fed up with doing it all
A	yeah
B	if nobody else can be found to replace them
A	mm
B	well you know if you don't mind doing it or if you like doing it that's fine
A	mhm
B	but if you want to step down um it's it's like a type of blackmail isn't it really
A	yeah
B	or sort of
A	they rely on your good nature
B	yeah
B	then I won't be okay
B	um
A	it is a big commitment though for something
B	yeah but it's
A	that you're doing in your spare time
B	but I can see that sort of two years down down the line
A	mm
B	I'll probably have had enough
A	yeah
B	of treasurer and publicity er and I won't wanna take on the chairman
A	no
B	but you know I I shall just step down from everything
A	but you're probably one of the younger older ones aren't you really?
B	well um
A	so
B	we've got a younger guy and a younger woman
A	oh right
B	she moved into the area
A	mm
B	and um she quickly got involved in
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	er or
A	mm
B	work in insurance
A	mm
B	and went to the
A	do they pay? mm it's not voluntary service?
B	well it's it's they don't charge people for their advice
A	mm
B	um but they do er have both
A	I thought they were all volunteers there
B	but usually the paid members of staff
A	A few
B	are only paid as part-timers
A	mm
B	you know they don't what they try and do is get as many volunteers as they can cos obviously
A	mm
B	the government's always cutting back
A	yeah
B	it's a state thing
A	yeah
B	it's not
A	yeah they're public servants
B	it's not private
A	mm
B	they rely quite a lot now on volunteers
A	mm
B	which means that people like
A	mm
B	either they lose their jobs or you know if they were working full-time they're suddenly told they they're only gonna be paid for three days a week or something like that
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	I dunno fifty-eight fifty-nine something like that
A	mm
B	and er and somebody I don't
A	mm
B	and he said yeah
A	oh
B	I'll come on your committee
A	and so what does he do on the committee sorry?
B	er
A	mm
A	oh yeah
B	that's
A	mm
B	whom you met
unknown_female	still watching the skating?
A	we're not really watching it
B	that's the um countryside
unknown_female	sorry?
unknown_female	no don't
B	mm
unknown_female	I'm alright
B	um and the role he's
A	okay
B	um
A	oh right
B	er the architect
A	yeah
B	a really nice chap
A	I know
B	yeah
A	I can't believe that's been two years
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah I
A	mm
B	one daughter lives in France
A	mm
B	um one er works locally and she's a very keen walker
A	oh okay
B	I often see her walking that way
A	mm
B	in the direction of you know I dunno the A14 or something
A	mm
B	towards
A	mm
B	she walks along there
A	mm
A	wow
B	um
A	mm
B	er she must've gone to university in September
A	mm
B	um
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh wow
B	very wealthy
A	yeah
B	in terms of cost
A	mm
B	well er they had a huge Victorian detached house
A	wow
B	absolutely enormous
A	do you think a million?
B	yeah I mean I think they've lived there since the seventies
A	yeah
B	they've
A	mm
B	er they they made it their er
A	mm
B	he was quite well-paid and they bought this huge place
A	mm
B	I haven't heard that she's moved
A	yeah
B	so yeah so
A	oh okay
B	so it's any um changes that are proposed to footpaths in the city
A	mm
B	he he will get involved in
A	oh okay
B	and that often happens because of all the developments in the city
A	yeah I bet
B	people building blocks of flats and things
A	mm
B	they're not always shall we say interested in footpaths
A	profit
B	mm
A	yep
B	yeah so er
A	mm
B	well it's five o'clock so er I can
A	mm
B	I can start putting the food on when you're ready
A	oo yum
B	um
unknown_female	yeah
B	okay
A	are you feeling confident about your homemade sauce?
B	well it's er you know um it's really to see what it tastes like
A	yeah
B	Cos
A	mm
B	in terms of the flavour
A	yeah
B	but they're full of lumps and full of onions and stuff that
A	Salt
B	and stuff that um well I don't think salt's a problem for
A	mm
B	chunks of tomato
B	which
B	I've gone  I've gone  right through the card at er Tescos
A	mm
B	ones
A	yeah
B	er but they all have big lumps in them
A	yeah
unknown_female	they're horrible
A	but when you're when they're all diced up really really small
B	well the trouble
A	that helps add to the
B	the trouble is they're not
A	no but what I mean is when you
unknown_female	I don't even like the flavour of them
B	yeah
A	when you make it yourself
unknown_female	they make things taste horrible
A	no
B	so what
A	onions add to the taste
unknown_female	no they don't
A	why the passata's gonna taste boring
B	all I've um all I've got
unknown_female	I prefer the taste without onions
B	all I've got
A	trust me
unknown_female	I hate onions
B	all I've got is um
A	you don't hate onions
unknown_female	I do
B	yeah well hang on a minute
A	onions
B	all I all I've got is um is the passata and um
A	herbs
B	the herbs
A	yeah
B	so there won't be any onions or
A	but that's what helps make the taste
B	well
A	onions make it taste nice
B	that's why I said will it it would be
A	mhm
B	to see what it tastes like
A	yeah
B	it might taste okay
A	Cos you can also get powdered garlic and things like that
B	yeah well it's
A	that would help
B	it's just
A	you don't like garlic?
unknown_female	no
A	you don't like garlic bread?
unknown_female	well yeah
A	it's it's garlic
unknown_female	is it?
A	yeah
unknown_female	well I like garlic bread
A	that's mental
A	you understand what you're saying is mental right?
A	no it doesn't
unknown_female	Cos garlic bread doesn't taste like
B	yeah
unknown_female	garlic in a meal
A	yes it does
B	no I I I I had the
A	it's garlic
B	I had the same problem because when I was growing up we didn't have er the um you know organic and stuff like that
A	mm
B	you either went to the greengrocers and bought stuff and made it yourself
A	mm
B	you bought stuff in cans
B	um but the subject matter was tomatoes
A	mm
B	she would do a salad and put tomatoes down
B	um and she put tomatoes down and she said right and and ham and or something or cheese or something like that
A	mm
B	and uncle
B	and she said well you eat tomato soup
A	mm
B	so it was the same conversation you two were just having
unknown_female	yeah
B	Cos if you
unknown_female	there is a difference
B	in those days you didn't have all these versions of tomato soup
A	mm
B	that you can get now
A	mm
B	you can actually get tomato soup that tastes like tomatoes now
A	yeah
B	but in those days all you had was Heinz
A	and then that just tastes of sugar
B	so it's lots of sugar
A	mm
B	so what we liked
A	kids love it
B	was the sweet taste of Heinz tomato soup
A	yeah
B	and that's the  that's the  conversation you two were just
unknown_female	yeah
B	having that you know you you can actually um have things like garlic bread
unknown_female	yeah
B	but it
unknown_female	it's not just the taste of garlic
B	yeah
A	but it's  but it's  lessened
unknown_female	yeah but
A	it as part of something else in a sauce
unknown_female	yeah
A	that's mental
A	the thing is with the tomato soup is that aren't any more tomatoes
unknown_female	it makes sense to me
B	mm
A	yeah but you like the
unknown_female	yeah but that's not got garlic in it
A	it has  it has it's got  it's got onions
B	no I don't think
A	it's got tomatoes
unknown_female	it doesn't
A	it's got garlic
unknown_female	no it doesn't
A	it's got basil
unknown_female	it doesn't
A	oregano
B	well if it has got  if it has got
A	it's got bay leaves
B	garlic it's only got a very small amount cos I couldn't taste it either
unknown_female	yeah
A	well the idea is you don't taste one thing over another
unknown_female	we did have one that did we did buy one sauce that did taste of garlic and I hated it
B	yeah
unknown_female	and it wasn't nice
B	no
unknown_female	at all
B	and er
unknown_female	tasted really garlicky
B	when we went to Carluccio's
unknown_female	oh yeah
B	garlic bread it wasn't the garlic that was
unknown_female	yeah I couldn't  I couldn't  eat that garlic bread
B	it wasn't the garlic
A	that was salt wasn't it?
B	that was the problem
unknown_female	yeah
B	they actually put
unknown_female	it was really garlicky
B	they actually put slivers of garlic on the
A	oh did they?
B	which
A	I've never eaten raw garlic before
B	um well it was cooked garlic
A	urgh
B	it was you know the hundredweight of salt they'd emptied on top of it
A	lovely
B	as well
unknown_female	yeah I found out as well
A	mm
unknown_female	you know um that advert you said was
A	yep
unknown_female	it's
A	it's not
unknown_female	it is
A	it's not
B	which
unknown_female	look it up
B	which advert's that?
A	Cos I said it's the Southern advert
unknown_female	it's looks like
A	it looks
B	southern?
A	it looks like
unknown_female	it looks a lot like
A	it's a
A	and it's a Southern rail line
B	southern
unknown_female	yeah
A	and it looks exactly like
unknown_female	it looks like
B	mm
unknown_female	and we had an argument about it
B	mm
unknown_female	last time
B	mm
unknown_female	so I looked it up
A	it looks exactly like it
B	well I know  I know
unknown_female	no there were
B	I know what
unknown_female	yeah
B	oh I know what it looks like
unknown_female	yeah
B	Cos I used to go to the when I used to meet uncle
unknown_female	you can see differences from
B	I used to go on the train there
unknown_female	Cos I went there every day
B	mm
unknown_female	to work
B	yeah
unknown_female	there are differences
B	mm
unknown_female	so I looked it up and it's
B	yeah I know  I know  what
B	right
A	okay
A	oops
unknown_female	I feel like I'm being violated
A	violated? You're um you've already sold your soul
unknown_female	mm
A	to me
unknown_female	true
A	it's too late now
unknown_female	yep
A	I was gonna say I'll bring you round a six-pack when I um get my first payment
unknown_female	trying not to
A	mm
unknown_female	one or  one or  two here and there is alright
A	mm
unknown_female	but I haven't I don't think
A	oh lovely passata
unknown_female	I haven't drunk a beer in over a week
A	really? That's good
unknown_female	yeah
A	mm
unknown_female	that's probably a good sign
A	that's really good
B	is it alright?
A	mm
unknown_female	I think you were here actually the last time I had a beer
A	oh really?
unknown_female	yeah one of the nights you came round for Lost
A	mm
unknown_female	maybe a week ago
B	let's try it
A	mm
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah it's alright
B	mm
unknown_female	there's cheese in there isn't there?
A	mm
unknown_female	are you not eating cheese?
A	there's a
unknown_female	yeah?
unknown_female	I'll grate some in a bowl
B	it's in the fridge the cheese
A	okay
B	mm
A	mm
B	I don't er keep a record of how I um create the sauce
B	I just put the passata in first and then I
A	yeah
A	mm
B	and oregano
A	yum
B	and I taste it
A	well
B	half-way through and see what it's like
A	when mum's bay tree comes back to life
B	mm
A	I can give you some bay leaves
B	mm
A	you could just keep them in a jar in the cupboard
B	I always forget
B	I expect if I left them rather than putting them in the cupboard if I left them on the side I'd probably see them
A	mm
B	I'm leading my walk in a couple of weeks' time
A	well I was thinking I'd come
B	mm
A	I came on the last one didn't I
B	mm
A	this one's
B	um
A	oh
B	it's on Lord de
A	oh yeah
B	I think um
A	that's right
B	thity-five thousand acres in
A	wow
B	it sounds like um a very old title doesn't it?
A	mm
B	I mean the
A	very posh
B	er it's just um
A	mm thanks for pudding
B	they used to live in
A	oh I see
B	so it's Lord of
A	mm
B	they've just made it sound a little more um
unknown_female	mm
B	um class sort of upper class really by saying
A	mm
B	um but the title was first given to er the family in the eighteen eighties
A	mm
B	I mean
A	yeah
unknown_female	is this the walk
B	mm
unknown_female	you're going on?
B	one I'm leading
unknown_female	okay
B	and so it's rather strange cos um I thought there was a pub half-way round
A	mm
B	unpleasant
A	mm
B	and see if they're open
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah I prefer this sauce dad
B	you like this?
unknown_female	yeah
B	okay
unknown_female	I think you did really well
B	okay
unknown_female	nice
B	I'll get the um I'll get the passata
unknown_female	mm
B	managed to find it in Sainsbury's cos they can for some reason in Tescos I can't find if they've got it I don't know where they keep it
A	mm
A	I find supermarkets so confusing
B	searched
A	I don't know if it's me
B	I searched high and low
A	mm
unknown_female	it's cos you the you learn the lay-out after er a hundred times of going there
B	mm
unknown_female	and then they change it
B	then they change it
A	mm
B	to make the idea is that you'll look at other things
unknown_female	mm
A	yeah it's cheeky
B	in trying to find what you're wanting
unknown_female	mm
A	mm
B	no
A	to be
B	no
A	that's always difficult to hunt down
B	yeah
A	mm mm mm
B	are you?
A	there's a group that meets
A	in
B	hope it's a clear sky
A	sky is clear
B	mm
A	because they bring actual telescopes for you to have a look
B	yep
A	mm
B	that's good
A	I know
B	oh really
A	yeah
B	oh good
A	it's really clever
B	mm
unknown_female	I always see the same one
A	mm
unknown_female	everywhere I look is Orion
B	mm
unknown_female	whenever I look up
A	that's the only one I know
B	Orion or the Plough
A	mm
B	the Plough is an easy one to see
unknown_female	I notice the W
B	mm
unknown_female	whichever one that is
B	um
A	mm
B	now I'm thinking of onomatopoeia
A	Ursa Minor?
B	no it's it's it's got
A	Ursa Major?
B	it's got an E E in it
A	hm
A	oh okay
B	mm
unknown_female	right
B	that's the W I think
A	Ursa Minor's a um constellation within a constellation isn't it?
B	I don't know
A	or it's oh no it's one within Orion's Belt I think
B	yeah
unknown_female	that's where the galaxy is
A	mm
unknown_female	Orion's Belt
A	mm
B	mm
A	no I don't know er anything really
B	yeah
unknown_female	ask them how many of those stars could be a sun
B	they all are
unknown_female	to another planet
A	aren't they all?
B	they're all
unknown_female	yeah but how likely is it that there's another planet like this off one of them
B	oh actually the the odds without actually knowing the odds must be very much in the favour
unknown_female	mm
A	mm
B	Cos there's just so many of them
A	it's like when you watch um anything with Brian Cox in
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah
A	because he sort of says
B	mm
A	all of these things are possible but it would just the the
unknown_female	you we'll never know
A	likelihood of it happening is just
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah
A	so slim but you
B	mm
A	can't say for certain that it won't
unknown_female	yeah
A	possible
unknown_female	it's Schrdinger's cat
A	mm
unknown_female	I only know these things from watching
unknown_female	the Big Bang Theory
B	big Bang Theory
B	mm
A	it's the only bit of television that isn't rotting your brain then
unknown_female	mm
B	on on one of the channels I can't remember which one they've got um a UFO er
A	mm
B	but they're about you know er creditable sightings rather than the you know
A	crackpots
B	the ones yeah who may think are a bit odd
A	in Roswell
B	um and um the one last week was about an American physicist who claims he was working on an alien craft which landed er somewhere somewhere in
unknown_female	in Roswell New Mexico
B	well it wasn't there
A	mm
B	it was er
A	right
B	um and a lot of the sightings they believe er of flying saucers in the area they they they did move it to a desert area
A	mm
B	actually
unknown_female	area 51
B	area 51
unknown_female	I'm sure that's Roswell
A	that is
B	oh is it?
unknown_female	that's the same story
A	yeah
B	oh is it? Oh right
unknown_female	roswell in New Mexico
B	they did move it to a desert area to keep it out the way of everything but
A	mm
B	of course they wanted to you know if they could do anything to it to get it flying they wanted to test it
A	yeah
B	but of course you know even if you go to desert area somebody's gonna see it
A	yeah
B	so they've had sightings
A	yeah
B	so
unknown_female	yeah but there's always one guy and you don't you never know whether whether to believe him
B	mm
A	oh I really like that film
unknown_female	there was one guy
B	mm
unknown_female	who claims to this day that he was on Apollo 20
B	yeah
unknown_female	which the American government say never existed
B	yeah
unknown_female	but he said he went to the moon and he saw those spidery rock
B	mm
unknown_female	crab
B	mm
A	mm
unknown_female	things
B	mm
unknown_female	and he saw that the Russians did get to the moon
B	mm
unknown_female	he claimed it a long time before
A	well the film is based on that um conspiracy theory isn't it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	of that  of that  um episode or whatever you wanna call it
A	those spider babies
unknown_female	mm
B	it is a bit gruesome though
A	mm
B	what happens you know what er the film depicts happening
A	mm
B	to the astronauts
A	mm
unknown_female	you er you know er you can look at it both ways
B	no
unknown_female	the people that actually got there
B	mm
unknown_female	because they were scared of something
B	mm
unknown_female	and they didn't wanna go back
A	mm
B	well there there might have been
unknown_female	but then er you know that's just one theory
B	mm
unknown_female	once
A	that's true
unknown_female	we got to the moon we didn't wanna spend that much money again
A	mm
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	you know that
B	that er having got there and got back perhaps they didn't wanna chance doing it
unknown_female	yeah
B	twice
unknown_female	so I think
A	yeah
unknown_female	on the moon
unknown_female	got
B	have been scattered around the earth
unknown_female	brought back and given to
B	mm
unknown_female	and people like that
B	mm
A	which is great
unknown_female	so there's spidery rocks in Afghanistan and
B	yeah
unknown_female	Libya and places like that
B	yeah
A	so they're just gonna rise up one day are they?
B	I mean if you um if you
unknown_female	thanks dad
B	Good
B	and have
B	had it on your mantelpiece
A	mm
B	you know would you  would you
unknown_female	I think I would
B	I I imagine you probably would
unknown_female	mm
A	in the fire
B	mm
A	no that's fine
unknown_female	is that because you were talking about salad?
A	sorry?
B	what's that?
unknown_female	is that because you were talking about nan giving you
B	what's that?
unknown_female	salad?
B	yeah it was in my mind
unknown_female	telling you  telling you
B	it was in
unknown_female	to eat the tomatoes
B	it was in my mind
B	actually
B	do you like?
unknown_female	well I don't mind tomatoes
B	do you like tomatoes?
A	no I don't like tomatoes
B	okay
A	I mean I don't like raw tomatoes
B	Cos I was gonna warn you that cos quite strange what
unknown_female	mm
B	Heinz tomato soup tastes nothing like tomatoes
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	well the these have got it
A	mm
B	and normally when
unknown_female	mm
B	what I tried to do was not buy English ones cos English tomatoes have got a strong taste
A	mm
B	and buy the small round ones
A	mm
B	cherries tomatoes
A	mm
B	or sweeter
A	mm
B	mm
A	Don't like them
B	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	Don't you like olive oil?
A	I do just not not not on my salad
B	really? That's where you put it
A	in the pan
B	oh you can do that yeah
B	Cos people um toss salad in olive oil and balsamic vinegar but I
A	mm
B	inegar upsets my stomach
A	mm
B	so
A	oh I tend tend not to have anything if I have it with salad
B	sorry?
A	I tend not to have anything
B	mm
A	I suppose you can get vinaigrettes can't you
B	yep
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	hm
B	oh
A	what's the matter?
B	I've got a letter for you
A	for me?
B	mm
A	is it a cheque?
B	it's a well it's
A	oh right
A	mm
A	better than nothing
B	well it is Lent
A	it is Lent
B	have you gotta send it off to them?
A	yeah you just put it in the package and then they send you a cheque
B	right
A	if I give it to
B	yep
A	do I have to write to Amnesty or can I give it to you?
B	no
A	okay
B	have a oh are you still eating? I was gonna say have a seat over there and just relax on this seat if you want
A	yeah
B	you can have the soft seat now cos I'll swap over and I'll sit on the one erm
A	oh if you're sure
B	oh yeah yeah
A	mm
B	forget all about it
B	yes it's a nice phone
A	it's good isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	is they give you this shell
B	yeah
A	and then on the front they give you a sticker to put over the
B	mm
A	the screen so it's scratch-proof
B	mm
A	once you
B	mm
A	actually
B	mm
A	turn it on
B	such a big thing isn't it?
A	I know it's massive
B	mm
A	it's er seems if you put it to your ear like it seems so strange to
B	mm
A	to talk on it
B	it's I think
A	mm
B	but um what's happened to mine is
A	it's got scratched
B	can't see it so well in here
A	yeah
B	so I was  I was  thinking of something like that
A	mm
B	and her deal
A	yeah
B	er is that if if you go to I think I'm right
A	mhm
B	which I have
A	um I don't know that about packages you know
B	hmm
A	home packages
B	I'll I'll have I'll be
A	but it's it's worth speaking to them about
B	I'll be speaking to mum at some stage so I can
A	or I could give you my phone
B	yeah I didn't I wasn't thinking that
A	I could wipe that one and give you that
B	mm
A	well I mean I
B	but it probably won't work because you have to get them unlocked don't you? Like you cos your
A	tut oh you're with Virgin
B	no I'm with um T-Mobile you see that's why I was thinking of Virgin
A	oh
B	so what I might do next time I go into the city centre or in fact I could do it online couldn't I?
A	mm
B	is just see whether there's any reference on their website to a deal
A	mm
B	have you found AuthorHouse?
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	is it?
B	Don't know
A	AuthorHouse exists to help authors achieve success
B	yeah
A	probably just get some cheap you know product at the end of it that doesn't look very professional
B	mhm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sounds dubious
B	well I'd be nervous about
A	bookshop
B	putting any money up I think
A	well
B	I mean if they wanted to um see what they could do touting it around well fine
A	mm
B	because presumably with your authors I mean a lot of your authors are probably dead
A	mm
B	they you know they write the material and you sell it on their behalf
A	well er in because it's reference and because it's a specific market rather than accept submissions they commission
B	yeah
A	so they'll look at the market and speak to the schools and
B	yeah
A	see what they what
B	mm
A	particular
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and then based on
B	but when
A	that market research they'll commission the product
B	when they  when they  do a commission they don't say to somebody look you know we've got lots of schools that want a book on you know syntax
A	mm
B	therefore you know er if you're prepared to um um pay us you know a thousand pounds
B	er we'll we'll get them to publish you know
A	no
B	we'll publish it and sell um sell it so it's
A	it's the same contractual deal that you'd have
B	you you don't you  you don't  you don't do that do you?
A	no
B	what what
A	they get a fee and then they get royalties
B	yeah
A	they certainly don't pay
B	yeah
A	I mean it's a very small world
B	whereas with this one I imagine you have to pay them
A	it's yeah it's a bit
B	does it say that?
A	it doesn't it's a bit unclear
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if you look at bookshop
B	so it's money up front and what sort of product
A	mm
B	ask whether they've got any samples of what the
A	mm
B	finished product looks like
A	yeah
B	or is there anything they could
A	yeah
B	have you heard of any of the top sellers?
A	no
B	oh right
A	mm
B	that's going to er that's gonna equal J K Rowling isn't it
A	mm blimey
B	that is very much a limited limited market but yeah
A	it's just cheesariffic
B	mm
A	it really is
B	mm
A	because there's no money
B	yeah
A	they're not gonna
B	yeah
A	pay money are they to get a professional
B	the they're not
A	cover designer
B	they're not gonna get  they're not gonna get  er a
A	tut no
B	not for four hundred quid
A	no
B	five hundred quid or whatever it was
A	huh
unknown_female	previously on Lost
B	on Lost
