A	and you need to be bothered enough to actually go into
B	yeah
A	mm
A	you're just gonna go in this way now
B	do you want to think about that question? This one
A	oh sorry yeah
B	no actually
A	hmm
B	mm
A	ah
B	okay so what do you think of that
A	the
B	are they you know the quality is very good
A	mm
B	er it's not
A	uh-huh
B	in the same way that sort of maybe newer and swisher ones are so we're gonna have our own
A	yeah
B	and that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	erm but they're very very comfortable
A	uh-huh
B	erm they certainly er you know used to be er very good taste
A	yeah
A	hmm mm
B	erm nowadays
A	oh right okay so
B	Cos then erm I erm we used to go to Pen Cywm
A	yeah
B	from when I was at sixth form onwards
A	yeah so
B	well we can see from the pictures
A	yeah
B	erm
A	okay
B	yes although to be fair it would be very little more expensive than the other one would have been just to have this one for the weekend and not use it
A	yeah
B	we could of course just have it for a week
A	yeah I mean we could try and ask them and see if we can get it
B	Don't I mean we could just go
A	or just go for the week yeah yeah
B	have the entirety of a week off
A	so yeah
B	still driving and fuel conserving petrol
A	ha ha
B	er it would be three to four days
B	I think I'm not sure that's what I want to do particularly at the moment
A	yeah
B	oh deer
A	yeah
B	I though it was a fox to start with
A	yeah I did yeah
B	poor thing it was probably trapped on that side
A	yeah
B	not hugely bright admittedly
A	no
B	unlike the car lights which are coming towards it
A	huh huh
B	see what I did there?
A	I did see what you did there
B	mm
A	ha ha
B	well no I meant sort of in that situation
A	you started off?
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly I'm not sure it's
A	I mean it's pointless taking leave for the sake of it
B	yeah I mean if it is
A	yeah
B	so it feels like it's not a long way but obviously it is
A	yeah
B	it would be a complete change
A	yeah it would and it it would be maybe nice in the sense that we wouldn't feel like we kind of had to do anything
B	yeah I mean cos er there's so much there to do and I've done it all already
A	yeah
B	and we could go up to Aberystwyth sort of bit of retail therapy such as it is
A	indeed
B	some champagne
A	some champagne
B	well they do have a pool
A	they do have a pool? Ooh
B	yes
A	ah
B	like I said probably not gonna be open
A	yeah
B	Cos there are no speed cameras and therefore I'm just gonna allow the car to bring itself down to speed
A	yeah
B	oh we were gonna get through on the lights so we didn't have to brake there
A	nice
B	I know
A	and it should be quiet
B	yes indeed
A	erm yeah
B	wander down the ah because it's in the village we can wander down the pub in the evenings
A	ah
B	you can
A	yeah
B	the erm yeah
A	ah that sounds quite nice
B	yes
A	yeah I agree with you that
B	either of the other two
A	either of the other two might be nice
B	yeah they're both the same price which is a very sensible pricing structure
A	yeah
B	they probably will do I mean unfortunately it's no longer
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm yeah
B	mm
A	oh okay
B	erm
A	so if you yeah so if you say I know
A	but yeah what do you think? I think that could be quite nice
B	what was the
A	there is the
B	I mean we could check that out
A	yeah
B	but not as relaxing
A	but yeah
B	wow
A	yeah nice
B	perfect
B	easing off  my old chum
A	hmm mm
B	yeah didn't have to stop
A	you're in the peak of efficiency tonight
B	I'm trying
A	ha ha
B	you see it's quite fun as an exercise
A	mm
B	what can you eek out?
A	hmm mm sounds wrong
B	mm
B	erm
A	ha ha ah dear
B	quiet in
A	yes indeed yeah
B	what we should do on Sunday
A	interesting yeah
B	Deluxe
A	actually yeah er we should talk about that tonight cos me and
B	I'm not working out tomorrow
A	no
B	er yeah
A	um oh yeah I mean if if we're going out in
B	alright
A	um if that would be as the same as normal?
B	yeah that sounds great yeah
A	cool
B	so I'm easing off now
B	so a little bit more acceleration now
A	nice
B	that is forward planning
A	ha ha that was incredible
B	yeah
A	no
B	well I bet they're working
A	ha ha
B	the lights
A	yes they are I know
B	just easing off here
A	oh er in in there's a fair queue down there
B	only two cars
A	two cars
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	I'll go and fill the car up
A	yeah
B	ironically sitting up with your engine idle in that queue you'd probably be more cost effective to drive to
A	yeah
B	well maybe not by the time you've driven there but
A	well
B	it's quite a big lorry actually
A	no it looks smaller than some of them though
B	yeah
A	yes
B	okay
A	excellent so that's a plan for tomorrow night
B	um no
B	frankly
A	she'll probably say she doesn't mind so
B	yeah
A	hmm mm
B	erm I think I was thinking
A	we have had fish tonight
B	or we could
A	I was thinking
B	yes
A	um
A	yeah it could work
B	erm
A	where else?
B	presumably
A	mm yeah
B	then
A	I think  I think  I can get vouchers for
B	alimentum
A	hmm
B	erm if we go to
A	yes
B	what about?
A	I'm not particularly fussed on going to
B	iranian?
A	well it was very nice
B	so Loch Fyne
A	oh right yes
B	easing off
A	hmm hmm hmm
B	damn it
A	hmm hm
B	ah
A	yeah
B	we know you're signalling where else are you going to be going
A	hmm mm
B	the quick and easy way
A	yeah
B	right
A	mm
B	which bus?
A	the Uni four
B	has the Uni four have anything to do with the university per se?
A	erm I think it's called that because it goes between erm kind of comes down from
B	ah
A	I think it just means you can
B	yep
A	and then through to
B	oh
A	that's really unattractive
B	I've seen actually it's not that bad I've seen a lot worse
A	why are they? It's like a uniform
A	ah
B	what specifically?
A	the skirts are all exactly the same length
B	what if it is a uniform? It's called fashion
A	ha
B	there's a very wide unnecessarily wide bike lane
A	yeah stupidly wide
B	it's almost a bus lane
B	okay so we just continue on along here until we get to er
A	I believe so
B	that's
A	that's
B	mm
A	um yes
B	oh okay
A	on the right now
B	is that still
A	that is
B	it's a weird college
A	it is strange yeah
B	it's just strange that you can do subjects here you can't do anywhere else
A	yeah
B	are they taught there?
A	yeah
A	but I think some of the solely Drama lectures are probably
B	and this is a degree from the University of
A	yeah
B	shite
A	well no I mean like so Education I think you have to do with a subject obviously
B	right
A	er I don't know if you can do just solely Education
B	no I meant the Education and Drama
A	oh right well it's not the same degree
B	what do you mean it's not the same degree?
A	education and Drama
B	oh Drama is not a degree is it? Can't get a degree in Drama
A	you can do English and Drama as a joint
B	yeah but you can't just do a degree in Drama
A	I don't know I you think you
B	now I'm focusing on looking for car parking
A	oh right yeah sure
B	with Drama students
A	yeah and so they hadn't done the er the first two years of English
B	so we need to figure out how to get into it
A	erm
B	okey dokey
A	so that's buses and it's the yeah it's the next next left
B	so
A	parking
B	so my other leg's aching now
A	oh
B	I was limping a lot today
A	mm
B	and then I forgot to limp for a bit and it starting hurting again
A	ah
B	right
A	erm
B	by that tree?
A	so
B	here presumably
A	there's a barrier but I'll see what it says
B	I should think so
A	terms and conditions of parking
B	er
A	ah right
B	what? I believe that we can get out here
A	okay so yeah
B	shall we go to the roundabout and have a look?
A	there must be a patient car park
B	patient
A	try this way I suppose
B	well no let's go back a bit further that way
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	which way?
A	so right
B	erm I need to know from here where?
A	so so the next left
B	so back the way we've come from
A	back yeah yeah sorry yeah
B	that's what I mean
A	sure
B	main hospital
A	main hospital car park yeah
A	ah multi-story
B	oh my God
A	NCP Car park
B	shite on a pitchfork
A	so two lanes
B	one assumes so yeah
A	oh my God
B	oh so it's free?
A	oh
B	yeah
A	okay
B	ah
A	ha ha
