unknown_female	wouldn't have liked to
C	three there's three on the middle floor two big rooms mine is the biggest one and then there's it's not a small room but it's small compared to the others it's got a double bed in it and a bit of space round it but mine has a double bed in the corner I could fit about five double beds in there it's such a big room so compared to that it does look small and then there's three rooms upstairs and they're still quite big erm and we numbered the houses like when we went and we were like we'll just pick them out of a hat like
A	with names
B	yeah that's what we did yeah
D	yeah that's what we did
C	so we just put we just put the desk of each room where we wanted

B	that's what we did yeah
A	I did mine on Skype so I had to have one with names one with room numbers
B	yeah
A	but I got the one I wanted
B	that's what we did I like my room I said I wanted a loft room I got a loft room so
A	well I got the I wanted a loft room originally but like the slope there's loads in middle but the bed is under the slope bit of the ceiling like you've got to have sex
B	can't you switch the pillow to the other end or can you move the bed?
A	no under like the whole bed is you couldn't move it we'd have to move it every time like
D	just move the bed somewhere else in the room
A	there's nowhere that you can put it like cos there's a wardrobe at the top end so you block your wardrobe or you've just fuck all floor space so anyway I was
B	have sex on the floor
A	yeah that wouldn't be very comfortable though would it? and they'd be able to hear it
unknown_female	yeah
D	I think I'd have to have well when I have sex have sex on the floor for the mere fact that my bed is so fucking creaky
B	is it? I never hear it when you were sleeping or out
D	that's alright
A	no but like I'm quite like

D	I wish we'd've done that
B	mm
A	I'm not like
D	seriously wish we'd've done that
B	it's caused so much hassle hasn't it? it's all my fault as well cos she told me how much she was paying for electric I were like you fucking what? like and I got
unknown_female	mm
B	it's my fault I was lying on the sunbed in Tenerife having the time of my life reading this conversation
D	I don't understand why everybody wasn't listening though
D	like nobody was listening to you
B	fucking
C	hang on what's this?
A	why what'd she do?
D	basically we're paying a lot er I can't even remember
A	she's
B	but that's an estimate
A	yeah but
B	it won't come to that though will it?
A	estimates go on the people who lived there last year
B	oh we're not like them dickheads they were all proper
B	yeah
B	I don't if it's seventy pound a month I'll be very surprised
A	but the point is it unit cost that were higher
B	mm yeah
A	if you're playing like
unknown_female	yeah
A	fifty pence more a unit than if you'd switched
B	mm
A	so it's like so expensive regardless of
B	yeah I had nothing to do with the whole gas electric thing I don't know who we're with now I have no idea who are we with? who are we with British Gas?
A	EON and British Gas no Npower and British British Gas
B	and I don't know like these letters come through and
A	I know this and I don't fucking live there
B	I have literally no idea I don't know if we're gonna switch or not
A	go on you were gonna tell a story about
B	yeah go on tell a story about
A	you've got to you've got to tell us
C	I can see how pissed off you are already
B	she she were fuming here she was like
C	I didn't even read the conversation properly I just saw everyone kicking off
B	when when er
C	are you all are you all
B	listen to me
C	is it your house chat or is it?
D	our house chat
C	and will you be don't it with
B	yeah I was there I was doing most of the playing
D	so for the however long me and
C	er so
D	yeah she's been saying we're spending way too much money on this this and this and I was like right okay now the thing about me is that like I'm a hoarder of information and when I need it I'll use it so she's been telling me this for weeks and weeks and weeks and I've just been nodding and saying yes and like she's been saying I think we need to suggest about changing I go like yeah okay yeah okay whatever whatever cos I'm not I wasn't
C	how much was it?
B	only for two of you it was that much like expensive?
D	well it was the estimate that they'd given us it was like
A	seventy pound just for electric
D	a month
B	just the two of ya?
A	and you and you use twice as much gas as what you do electric so you use gas twice as much a month normally
D	so I was well fucked off and I was like this isn't happening so I was with you wasn't I?
A	mm
D	so you told me to have a look so we started to have a look this that and the other and I'd put on on Facebook chat I've got this I've got this letter
A	five hundred pound a year can't ya?
D	you could save this amount of money if we change to this and
B	like completely ignoring
D	completely fucking blank me bearing in mind she's been giving me all this shit about changing and I was like what the fuck? I didn't put anything because I'm getting close to my last tether with
C	yeah
B	sorry but that would happen wouldn't it like you yeah
D	don't get me wrong I do like the girl but she is full of shit
A	she is full of shit
C	I think she's full of shit and I don't even really know her that well
D	she's such a lovely girl
B	she is lovely
D	but she's been treated like such a fucking princess all of her life
B	has she?
D	yeah
B	I though I though her dad were a bit of a prick to her like
A	she says that but
D	she says that for fuck's sake
A	I was like
D	I'm not being funny but where do you think her mum gets the money from?
B	yeah must be her dad yeah
D	she lost a set of Ray-Bans in a taxi cos she forgot to pick them up her mum felt sorry for her so she bought her a new pair if that was my mum she'd have gone fucking do one you were the one that lost them you can pay for a new pair but anyway apparently she got insurance on these ones so it doesn't really matter if she loses them again
C	Ray-Bans aren't that expensive obviously like
D	they're not but
C	a hundred and
D	no
C	but I wouldn't insure them
D	no now I'm not saying that she I guess she didn't expect them to be bought for her
C	mm
D	but her mum did it anyway yes it's a really really nice gesture but the whole point is is that she lost them herself it wasn't like they were stolen or like she lost them basically so yeah
D	she is
A	it is bullshit about her dad I think you know
B	I have no
D	well the thing is is that like I walk in after I've been at at god it was like the second week I'd been living with her I'd been at work all week and I was absolutely knackered and she'd been saying to me I'm such a clean freak when it comes to the kitchen I don't like any crumbs in it like
B	yeah she
D	on that's an absolute pile of shit
B	is she worse than me?
D	I'd come in
B	you know someone
A	who plate and cup on the side
D	because I mean
B	oh
D	yeah because me and
D	a plate and a cup I'm sorry that's from both her and
B	she's gonna really
D	to me as long as you as long as you wash it up and like okay we didn't put it back
A	no
D	whatever I'm sorry about that but we cleaned it up as long as you clean it up I couldn't give a shit
A	mm we were going outside we couldn't
D	I couldn't give a shit it is not a big fucking deal
C	yeah it's not
D	it's a it's a plate that gets used over and over again that's the whole point of having a crockery plate if you didn't want people to use them you use fucking paper ones oh my god so anyway been at work all week came back
B	oh her her new squeeze yeah?
D	eh wait he's not he's not her boyfriend oh don't don't say that word in front of her
B	she said to me he's a friend
D	with fucking benefits fucking hell she screamed down the place
C	I bet she
D	but anyway I walked in the plate's on the side and they'd got like stuck like the jam was literally stuck onto the plate the toaster was a mess like there was bits pieces of bread in it like pieces of bread
D	in in the toaster and I was like come on just get it out erm I asked her if she wouldn't mind taking the bins out cos there were two bin bags at the side of the door and as I picked them up were you there?
B	no
D	no it was
C	er
D	and I was like that's fucking disgusting opened the door
C	yeah
D	doing fuck all she says that she's a clean freak she sat down on on the erm on the chair and she just sat and watched me
C	oh god that's the worst that's what
D	I I sat and washed the pots I washed my pots that I'd used for breakfast that morning I then washed hers she never once said thank you and put like dried them put them away including hers and then I went to go clear the side and I was like I'm just gonna push it all into the floor and then I'm gonna hoover hoovered up and cos there was still juice on the floor I thought I'm gonna mop as well mopped up everything was absolutely perfect I was like oh I'm happy now she goes I'm hungry I think I'm gonna make dinner I was like right okay just make sure whatever you do it's clean
A	right this should seriously be a TV programme like just housemates

C	we we once had to use the ironing board without the cover on as erm like a a
D	how did you live like that?
C	well every time I used to clean up this she'd do it again so now I've created like a strict policy where we all wash our own pots and no one else's always our own straight after or you leave something in your room like I got so mad one time I got
C	and erm and er but the thing was once someone left even one glass

unknown_female	mm
A	yeah
C	like you guys never change don't know you
unknown_female	yeah
C	but you guys never change
D	I mean don't get me wrong like it wasn't like we didn't get on it was just that we didn't click
C	no
D	like none of us had common ground
B	you didn't have that one night though didn't you when you had like a movie night
D	oh yeah that's cos
B	oh
D	and it was me
C	it were like really
B	where the fuck is
C	yeah she's
B	never heard you talk about her before oh is that the girl that came up to you one night and said can you come out on a night out with me and you were like okay
C	yeah yeah
C	like she was just so quiet and never went out or anything she'd never been on a night out for before she came to Leeds
B	oh bless her
C	but then literally the last month like she she'd come and sit in my room and we'd be chatting for hours and I said to her I've got a really good friend
C	yeah
unknown_female	ah
C	like the last month and I was like I wish she'd have been like it from the start
B	mm
C	because I I used to complain about her all the time like cos she just didn't really speak to us or anything
B	who else was in your flat? you
C	yeah he he couldn't understand he
unknown_female	oh
C	so like so I didn't really speak to him much at like
B	he is loud
C	not even drunk
D	are you joking?
B	our window was open his window was open he was chatting to his mate I heard the whole fucking thing oh I've got
C	yeah he's really really loud and he would just shout like chanting
D	yeah cos isn't
C	yeah but not when he's you know not in that
B	yeah
A	like a child would
C	yeah like he just found it hilarious and he'd like sort of like play fight with her and stuff and she
D	oh god if that don't say I fancy you then what does?
C	used to get like genuinely like like genuinely annoyed her erm and he'd go into her room like you heard of what but I felt like proper like he made me feel like quite excluded
unknown_female	mm
C	like he'd just go in
B	those walls are a bit too thin
A	oh so thin
A	yeah
C	I used to get so annoyed with him
C	I never heard
A	well I had that with one of my flatmates erm she was from Sri Lanka and her parents and her family were like really really strict she literally had to ring every single one of the family members every single night and her mum'd ring her at eleven o'clock to make sure she was in bed like she was never allowed to go anywhere after nine o'clock
unknown_female	oh god
A	she had to like she had to go in by nine and like she'd have to ring every single one of her family members have a full conversation with them and she'd be on the phone to like one o'clock in the morning and get up at seven and start again like as soon as she woke up in the morning as soon as her eyes were open she were on her phone talking to someone
B	why?
A	I don't know because like you'd speak to her in kitchen and she wouldn't say two words to you
A	but like because she used to speak in Sri Lankan or whatever language it were like she used to get louder and louder and louder and like all you could hear even if you had the TV on anything would hear constantly
B	those walls are thin
A	and she was so loud though like you couldn't hear anyone else who were next to me but
unknown_female	yeah
A	you could hear her in the kitchen from her room that's how loud she were
B	I was the loudest in my flat me me and
B	so I'm banging on the wall going wake the fuck up you stupid prick he sleeps through the whole thing and cos our bed and he puts his phone here and this is our wall so the whole it vibrates my wall
B	I may as well be in the fucking bed with him
B	but he came home one night and we were like sit down
B	I'm like do not have an alarm clock
D	I once I once found
B	yeah it vibrates
D	and she was like really? like and I was like well put it this way I think you got at least seven phone calls
B	I I drew the short straw of being in room
D	thankfully I only had one person
C	I was in room A next to the kitchen that's why
B	room A's bad and room B's nearly bad cos they're conjoined like the beds are conjoined and I see
D	the only annoying thing was about being in room E was that the door
D	every time someone went to the
B	basically the room to be was room D
C	yeah
B	none of us got room D
A	yeah
C	but room D was like a small room
B	yeah I think
B	and the
C	ah no
