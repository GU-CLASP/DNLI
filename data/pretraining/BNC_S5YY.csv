B	ah
A	erm
B	how long is he away for?
A	a week erm and then I'm away after that for erm like er four weeks altogether
B	really?
A	yeah
B	where are you going?
A	I'm not going anywhere in particular
B	oh
A	I've just
B	yeah
A	like we we basically like say we're gonna do it and then just don't book anything erm and just we basically just said we'll go camping and if the weather's bad we'll try and get a cheap flight somewhere
B	that's alright where?
A	so that'll be the first week and then the rest of it I'm just at home
B	oh right whereabouts?
A	staycation erm
B	I dunno yeah
A	am I supposed to refer to the recording device?
B	yeah that's absolutely fine
A	okay
B	yeah it's recording yeah yeah it's fine just double-checking cos it'd be really sad if we recorded for forty minutes
B	and then there was nothing there
A	what shall I put for accent?
B	erm
B	yeah that's absolutely fine
A	erm I'll put northern English
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah we don't want them thinking you're Scandinavian
A	no exactly erm
B	I wouldn't know what your accent is actually I don't know how I'd describe it
A	it's kind of it started as a
B	yeah
A	yeah so that kind of like neutralised me a little bit but I also got a bit of like
B	yeah
A	erm
B	sucked out all the north
A	yeah exactly I kind of want it I want it back erm do I speak any when it's other languages does it mean how fluent do I have to be?
B	whatever you like if you can whatever you want really
A	hold a conversation
B	yeah
A	you speak Spanish don't you?
B	yeah well don't worry we're not gonna crack out in I'm not gonna check it
A	don't test me
A	I'm just gonna say yes
B	I'll bring you an exam paper
A	I guess I I'd probably be like A two
B	that's alright
A	er er er er I'm just gonna shall I do this afterwards?
B	yeah whatever
A	okay
A	cool cos I can't do two things at once
B	that's so exciting I absolutely love hey how are you?
D	or do you do you wanna do do you two wanna do
B	oh no I don't think
E	I'm just gonna hijack
D	cool
B	yeah
B	come and come join
E	but you could but
A	it's great here it's
F	I wanna join now
A	this is like the most fun place to be
B	yeah
A	you can all have ten minutes if you want?
E	is it already recording?
A	yeah we're already recording
B	ten minutes with
E	oh right oh sorry
B	that's alright
B	no er no we know who you are so
A	it's weird how having that there slightly changes the conversation
B	yeah we
A	like it's not really it I mean it'll be different
E	cos we're talking about food?
A	cos we're used to it but erm
B	yeah
E	or cos our mouths are full
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think just having the mobile on the table you normally have that so it kind of makes the conversation feel a little bit
A	yeah
E	yeah that's true
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	anyway we were talking about what were we talking about?
B	holidays you're going camping in the rain
A	oh I might be going camping in the rain or to
B	whereabouts?
E	er can I help you choose?
B	do you need some help?
A	we basically never get round to booking a holiday and just end up deciding what we're gonna do for the holiday like the day before we go on holiday
E	which is why you end up camping in the rain
A	yeah erm so
E	so this is like if you actually organise a
A	well no actually what we would prefer to do is go camping in the UK
B	not in the rain
A	erm
E	yeah
A	we've been looking at cheap flights and we can get cheap flights to
B	mm
A	and we'll just do that if if the forecast is looking bad like on the first day of our holiday we'll just go to
E	wow
B	what what's the erm where are you thinking camping wise?
A	Wales
B	mm
E	mm yeah
B	extra rainy
A	mm
E	Wales or
A	but you can't really like we like to go rock climbing
B	ah
A	and so doing that in the UK is a lot easier cos we've got guidebooks and we've got like we've got we can bring out stuff
E	uhu uhu
A	like you don't have to bring ropes and stuff on the plane
E	yeah
A	so we tend to stay in the UK if it's good weather so we can do that
E	fair enough
B	there's loads of rock climbing around
B	because my er just
B	my
B	they are the best I love orange orange and green
E	well
B	typical
A	transcribe that
E	let the recording show that she's swearing at me
E	but yeah if you in the south of France there's loads and loads of like outdoorsy type
A	cos apparently
E	you could you could do that there
A	yeah
E	I don't know if you'd need to bring some
A	and bring stuff that's the main thing
E	yeah
B	if you
E	but as in like if you go to a centre or something
E	well that's the thing
A	mm
E	if you don't go with anyone
A	we
E	oh well but you might be able to rent stuff
A	yeah
B	if you like I can speak to my friend's cousin who's massively into that kind of thing
A	oh
B	erm she she's like she's she lives in
E	mm
B	and she might know like where you could buy the
A	mm
B	borrow the equipment or have I dunno like
A	mm
B	yeah
A	cos erm the other thing with rock climbing and why we have to
E	yeah
B	mm
A	erm and so unless you rent a car
A	it's
E	it might end up being quite expensive
A	yeah
B	could you drive to
A	we're only there for a week
B	yeah
A	so we could do but
B	that's what my summer holiday was when I was little
A	it's so good
E	mm
B	yeah we used to just get in the car with a tent and just drive and then I'd we'd wake up have a hot chocolate go back to sleep
A	yeah
B	then we'd just arrived in France and
A	that's what we do in the UK we just put the
B	what with the hot chocolate?
A	yep yep hot chocolate
E	especially yeah
A	I never went camping as a child
E	no
A	I just like it now
E	I've only camped once at a festival and I hated it cos it was festival camping
B	yeah
B	last time I went camping was up in
A	mm
B	so and it's so beautiful but it was it was August and in like the day it was like really warm we were in shorts at night it was so cold I was in my sleeping
A	mm
B	bag
A	cos you're quite high up
B	yeah in really high up there there's loads of reservoirs it's really pretty
E	oh it's gorgeous in that part of the country isn't it?
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	well we could just go there but yeah I dunno anyway we'll see erm cos we're also a bit like should we go for a really active holiday or should we like go and just hang out on the beach in like
E	can you do that though? cos I always think I like that and then I get to a place and I spend one day and I spend about an hour on the beach and I'm like I'm so bored
A	yeah
E	I don't know what to do with myself just sitting there
B	yeah
E	I need like so it's good to have some activity
B	what about bat and ball I can play that for hours
A	yeah rounders
B	yeah just by yourself like
E	we're playing rounders on Monday but you're not you said
A	I've got writing club
B	writing club?
E	you with your other exploits
B	I wanna hear about that
A	er yeah it's just my friend from lunch who wasn't there actually erm it he's done a writing masters and set it up but I I write anyway erm that just makes me sound like such a dick
A	I write erm
B	it's very existential
A	yeah really I'm just trying to channel my inner Sartre erm
A	my inner Sartre is that how you say it?
E	oh oh right sorry
A	how do you say it?
E	Sartre
A	Sartre
E	Sartre I know
A	I just can't do that I can't do the Rs so Sartre's really hard it's like
E	it took me about it took me about five years to learn how to do that
A	yeah cos just can't do it I can do Spanish Rs
E	I can introduce myself in French
A	yeah
E	oh
A	it's really really hard
E	anyway
A	oh how do you say it?
E	so it's even harder
A	yeah
E	so you were saying
A	erm what was I saying? oh yeah erm alright
B	just get back to your
B	mm
A	and everyone's welcome
E	what do you do writing in the pub? you just sit and write or do you
A	we sometimes do we sometimes set a challenge that's like between two sessions so like you like we did one that was like erm write a write something in in the noire style which I found really hard cos I don't do any like genre stuff
E	mm
A	erm I just write about you know
B	your existential problems
A	erm yeah
A	erm
B	I've got this really good book erm I'd love to join by the way after my masters
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I'd love to do it
A	yeah
B	I've got this book and it's called Take Ten Minutes and it's like a hundred activities for writers that you do in ten minutes
A	mm I like that
B	and you you have a scenario then you pick a number between one and ten you kind of give a you're given like a personality or something
A	mm we did that at writing club
B	and then you just have to write oh really?
A	we did erm we've got a thing called writer's toss
A	erm which is when you know erm where you go to be like
B	yeah
A	various stuff and you all toss a coin and the combination you get decides what you get
B	write about
A	and then you we we do it in a session so we write for ten minutes and then we all flip again and get a new something new that happens and then you have to incorporate it I don't really like that kind of stuff as much cos mm I dunno it was quite fun to do writers toss but erm the challenges if they're too specific I found them a bit like
B	a bit like back at school
A	yeah
B	yeah I think they're quite good cos I used to do them with my grandad and he's a massive writer
A	oh
E	oh
B	erm but he found them like really restrictive and he found them really pressured
A	mm mm
B	especially cos you have to do these ones in ten minutes
A	mm
E	mm
B	but then what I found is like it was quite difficult but then when you went back and read it
A	mm
B	it's like wow did I just write that in ten minutes
A	mm yeah
B	so it's quite erm a good thing to
E	yeah
B	mix up yeah
E	er er
A	national novel writing month
B	oh in and there's yeah
A	and it's every November
B	yeah I've heard of it
A	loads of people in the world it's like through this website
E	jeez
A	yeah and er they they define a novel as fifty thousand words but like and so you have to turn around fifty thousand words but
E	right
A	erm the idea of it is cos obviously in a month you can't write a polished fifty thousand word thing
E	yeah
A	and also fifty thousand words is a very short novel
E	mm
A	but the idea is is that it's a about teaching people who think of themselves as writers but get kind of stuck cos they can't
E	mm
A	they don't they don't a lot of people are like I write but never write
B	never finish yeah
A	like
B	and don't have the excuse and
A	yeah
E	but there's writing for there's writing for kind of learning and writing for writing isn't like I think people sometimes mistake the fact that because they can't turn out a polished fifty thousand word novel a month
A	yeah
E	they can't turn out a polished fifty thousand word novel
A	ever yeah
E	it's like no you just have that's just one bit of it like you it's never gonna be perfect in the beginning
A	exactly
B	mm
E	you're gonna go through drafts you're gonna have to edit you're gonna have to put it in a drawer for a week and forget about it and come back to
A	and a lot of people think writing is about the idea and it's exactly the same as like starting a business
E	mm
A	like starting a business is not about the idea it's a little bit about the idea but most of it is about how you implement the idea
B	mm mm
A	and writing's the same like you can have a really good idea and the problem is I I get this a lot and I don't know if it's the same for other people if you have an idea for something and you stay with the idea and try and get the idea right you never write the thing
B	yeah
A	because you
B	yeah definitely
A	the idea becomes such a big thing and you don't wanna ruin it
E	yeah
A	and it's always gonna be better in your head than it is when you write it so what you have to do is you just have to be like that's an idea and then start writing
E	mm mm
B	and pour it out
E	mm mm
A	and and just be rubbish and like I mean some people don't write like that some people like edit as they go along and and write each sentence really carefully
E	ah but that's really yeah I do that and it's so time-consuming and tedious and frustrating
A	yeah
E	and you do feel like you never generate anything
A	er
E	and the thing is if you if you're that kind of writer I think you do that because you're a perfectionist
A	yeah
E	which means you'll do that for weeks you'll have turns out a thousand words and you still won't be happy with it so it was pointless
A	yeah and and then you you write less because you're like well when I do it it's never right
B	exactly
A	whereas if you put the
E	you have to learn to just gush
B	yeah
A	if what you expect from yourself is just turn up and write something
E	mm mm
A	and it some days it'll be better than others
E	mm mm
A	then you get into the habit of just that's the important thing
E	mm
B	and having the whole project erm
E	mm
B	so so
E	mm
B	he kind of just throws all his ideas into the Powerpoint
A	mm
E	I know
B	and then he works on this search and that's
E	yeah
B	so at any point if someone says to him you need to do the presentation now he's got the presentation
E	ah Interesting
B	whereas what I would do is I would kind of perfect it from the beginning
E	yeah
B	but that is far better so that's the approach I'm trying to take with my master's
E	mm
A	yeah
E	that's interesting
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I'm trying to just get like everything down there so that if tomorrow is the twenty-fifth of September I have to hand it in I'm like woah I've got enough words
E	you've got something yeah
B	yeah even though
A	also you cos it's all down in the page you free up loads of mental space for
E	yeah
B	mm
A	cos cos when
E	you're not trying to keep it in your head
B	yeah
A	when you try and do it like that like the
E	yeah
A	when you're here
E	yeah
A	whereas if you it's it's the same as
E	yeah
A	and then you've got something to work on and that's an
B	mm
A	immensely nicer psychological situation than feeling like you've got all the stuff in your head and you're you can't get it out
E	yeah yeah
A	fast enough so
A	it was really good so I did that and erm like did a first draft and er I don't think I'll ever use it but it
B	now you're a celebrity author
A	yeah and
B	so easy
A	and now I write for er
A	that's that's my story but
B	guys I'm just gonna I might have to go I might come back but
E	okay
B	carry on
E	okay I might have to as well in a minute
B	alright
A	if that's what you want?
A	just give
E	okay
A	I'll just it here and speak to it
A	and when people come to volunteer you can just point them towards me
A	be like
E	she she needs friend
A	this is what's happening
E	this is
A	people look at her and go oh
E	or Yorick whatever it is
A	Yorick yeah I knew him very well
E	Yorick's the skull isn't he?
A	I knew him Horatio yeah
E	I knew him Horatio that's it isn't it?
A	he's talking to Horatio
E	that's the misquoted most misquoted line ever and something er
A	yeah
E	I've never seen that one
A	Hamlet
E	yeah I think
A	it's quite long so and and quite hard so a lot of people don't do it in school
E	I don't think
A	we were told not to write about it for our exams in university
E	yeah really?
A	well cos it we weren't told not to but we
E	yeah
A	they said like if you're gonna do Hamlet do Hamlet properly
E	what does that mean?
A	like if you're gonna do if you're gonna write about Hamlet in your essays in in your exam make sure that you've really you really know it really well and you have something to say about it
E	ah cos you have to be so selective and stuff
A	you have to be like quite original in your exams like that's what's expected
E	how can you be original about something that's been analysed for five hundred years?
A	yeah
E	it must be so
A	I think it doesn't have to be not something that somebody's already written but it has to be fresh and and clearly coming from you
E	yeah
A	and not
E	not just a patchwork of other people yeah
A	taken
E	mm
A	if you're allowed to just go in there and know the play really well and say what you wanna say about it
E	and say what you think yeah
A	that's actually and you have to like point to a couple of critics and like know what the rough erm
E	yeah
A	landscape looks like but it's not erm I I prefer improvisation because then
A	you don't have to you're not at a disadvantage if you haven't worked as hard as other people
A	erm
E	I don't even remember my uni exams at all I don't remember which subjects
A	it's weird
E	which like modules I had exams in I don't remember how long they lasted I don't remember what I wrote I don't remember if they went well
A	I
E	mm
A	because I always I I always loved exams like I absolutely loved exams
E	really?
A	and just came out of them being like full of like
E	yeah
A	yeah
E	and you get go
A	and I loved it but I'd like to know if they were rubbish
E	see I didn't mind them but I didn't love it yeah well
A	just
E	yeah but you've got your do you not have a transcript with your breakdown of grades?
A	oh I've got my grades but I mean if I read the essays are they better than what I write
E	mm
A	outside of the exam? because I think that pressure that pressure feels like it's really good
E	yeah
A	but it it might be rubbish
E	but you might still write some nonsense and they might have adjusted the marking for that anyway like they
A	yeah they definitely do
E	like they'll recognise the fact that you can't plan out everything and you might change tack coming through
A	yeah
E	like we say about writing you just get all your ideas down and then you take a slightly different direction
A	yeah
E	so
A	but I but less about the grade but more just kinda do I write better in that situation?
E	mm
A	and I there's no way of me knowing objectively like
E	yeah
A	which because I can't see what I wrote
E	you could do a little research project do it now give yourself like an hour in a room make someone else stand over you
A	yeah
E	and compare that to what you write
A	because the the really interesting thing is you would just get a paper full of
E	uhu
A	that you
E	ah
A	and you wouldn't know what it was
E	ah and you just
A	so yeah so
E	mm mm
A	you have to write about three essays in three hours
E	right
A	erm and erm some of them you would get in there and just read the fifteen questions and be like none none of these
E	none of the yeah
A	because you have to quote as well an an unseen so
E	oh I see
A	if the if it's the Shakespeare paper you you have to quote the place as you write about them
E	oh my god
A	about questions that you haven't known in advance
E	so you basically have to know all the plays off by heart?
A	basically you learn you choose some plays so so I chose like ten
E	uhu
A	separate plays
A	that I erm that I knew that I knew really well
E	yeah
E	yeah
A	without quoting and then I chose erm particular verses that were very versatile
E	right
A	erm and learnt them
E	so you could always adapt them to something yeah
A	mm but like the last two weeks of our revision
A	were just learning quotes basically
E	jeez
A	and I I wish I could remember them now but it's cos it was cramming
E	yeah but you cram yeah
A	you just don't remember them erm
E	but see that's the funny thing I don't feel like I did anything at uni I had to cram for and I still don't remember it
A	yeah
E	I remember bits but so much of it just like and I did two modules of English no er wait
A	yeah
E	I know we did Shakespeare something because that's when I first ever read erm
A	A Winter's Tale?
E	yeah must be that
A	it's the only one I haven't read
E	clearly it make a huge
A	yeah
E	it's so weird
A	it's weird isn't it?
E	how much of my uni experience is just blacked out of memory
A	I get that as well though like I couldn't I I can't talk authoritatively about most periods of literature
E	yeah
A	and like wrote
E	no but maybe that is not despite the fact but the fact that you worked through all of them and didn't go into much depth
A	oh because I have read all Shakespeare plays apart from Winter's Tale
E	right
A	cos we were told in the Easter holidays if so we had Easter holidays and then the Easter term was Shakespeare term in our first year and they said read the complete works in the holidays
E	oh my god
A	erm so it that was worked out at about a play a day
E	wow
A	erm so I read a play a day and
E	yeah
A	in the Easter holidays
E	except for Winter's Tale
A	yeah didn't ever do Winter's Tale
E	why did you miss that one?
A	I don't know I think it was last alphabetically in my complete works
E	so maybe just didn't bother
A	yeah erm
E	oh that's funny
A	and it's quite long I seem to remember
E	yeah
A	erm so I I've read them all but
E	yeah
A	there's very few of them that I remember the plot or any of the characters
E	yeah but also if you read the entire works of Shakespeare in a a month or however long it is
A	I know and I wish they hadn't asked us to do that because
E	did you actually need to when you got to the Shakespeare term?
A	kind of cos cos supervision's then erm you are given like er an essay topic per week
E	mm
A	and you have to just write about anything
E	mm
A	so the fact that I'd read them all was quite helpful in selecting what I was gonna write about
E	okay
A	erm
E	yeah
A	cos otherwise I wouldn't have been able to choose
E	to choose yeah
A	erm and also we had this crazy er Shakespeare supervisor who's really famous he's died now actually but she
E	oh
A	she's called
A	awesome erm
E	ninety something?
A	yeah and she lived in these rooms in
E	ah
A	and she would have like things delivered erm during our supervisions and she would get like crates of Smirnoff delivered
A	it was like yeah erm and
E	that's brilliant
A	erm she would just take us down like she would just completely take us down everything we said she'd just be like no that's wrong and then quote like a massive passage she could just quote any
E	oh my god
A	play
E	so I would have been
A	yeah
E	I know myself when I was eighteen or nineteen
A	yeah
E	if I'd had tutorials like that
A	yeah
E	where lecturers for the purpose of education like I know they don't just you know bitch at people
A	yeah
E	but if they absolutely slated something I really thought was important and relevant I would have cried I like I wouldn't have had a strong enough personality
A	yeah I cried after the first couple of supervisions but like not not because but it they it was never personal but it was they never would attack you personally they would just say well actually what you've written here is isn't correct because this this and this
E	mm
A	and the reason I cried wasn't because I felt attacked it was because I was like never gonna know enough
E	right
A	it was that feeling
E	yeah
A	and actually that feeling is quite useful to implant in people because they then they study
E	yeah
A	really hard erm
E	but don't they also
A	no because
E	I can never finish there's no endpoint
A	but that's the case anyway
A	but isn't it? but
E	it is but I don't think it would normally weigh on my mind so much unless someone was constantly pointing out the fact that I still had so much to learn
A	but in some ways they managed to do it in a way that doesn't make you feel like that's a negative thing
E	wow
A	but they managed to make you feel like that just is means that that there's this open-ended world that where you could you can learn anything anytime which is quite
E	that's quite good
A	yeah and it's not like they're nasty it's just
E	mm
A	it's just academic discussion it's just like yeah
E	yeah
A	no I mean I get what you're saying but actually if you consider this this and this like it that doesn't really make any sense
E	yeah
A	like have you considered this?
E	mm
A	maybe you should read this
E	you're right
A	er
E	that's quite a skill to give feedback though like that that doesn't feel nasty or personal
A	yeah I mean some of them did but I think
E	ah
A	that what your director of studies does is that they make sure basically that your first two terms you're not supervised by a monster
A	then
E	and after that you can have anyone
A	and then you have a thick enough skin and enough knowledge to be able to argue back if if you are you know
E	yeah yeah
A	if somebody attacks you and you don't agree with them
E	yeah
A	like now I would be very happy to be like yeah okay
E	but I still
A	yeah
E	yeah that's good
A	erm
E	whereas
A	it's yeah it's it's a it's an interesting thing but she was great and she yeah she she was just like
E	yeah
A	so you just couldn't
E	well I imagine if she was ninety and still lecturing
A	yeah you couldn't like
E	mm
A	like you would never say any like all of the supervisions were like a discussion
E	mm
A	erm because it's just you and the other person
E	mm
A	er the the supervisor so you talk about your essay
E	mm mm
A	that's like what a supervision is and then erm hers were basically her talking at you
E	mm
A	kind of going through your essay and being like no no no
A	erm and we were all really worried because our exams are coming up erm soon after it and we were like on a and then that was the paper we did the best on
E	ha
A	and it was like how has that even happened? like somehow by osmosis
E	yeah
A	just by being attacked
E	yeah
A	continuously it's like
E	maybe she just made you really care about it?
A	yeah yeah but she was yeah I don't know why I mentioned her in the first place
E	oh we got distracted saying about Winter's Tale Shakespeare reading all those books
A	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah but she was cool she was like the only professor that I had that was like really eccentric
E	yeah
A	so she's the one I always if if anyone's like did you have like a very eccentric professor and like a
E	yeah she was the
A	yeah
E	actually yesterday I saw erm the one of my he he lectured us on language play erm that was one of the modules one of the best modules I ever took in my linguistics degree and he was my dissertation supervisor because my undergraduate dissertation was about humour in sign languages so it was all about
A	oh wow
A	that's so cool
E	erm it was awesome I loved it I really enjoyed it and then he
A	do they do puns?
E	that's what I was trying to find out my my kind of hypothesis which looking back actually I was really proud of this for a BA dissertation was quite an original
A	mm
E	research idea because you're not
A	yeah
E	but I just really wanted to know I'd taken the
A	yeah
E	where the actual form of the word itself or phrase itself
A	yeah
E	becomes the subject of the
A	yeah like a story joke
E	but stuff like puns and plays on words
A	yeah
E	and I just thought well it why couldn't you do that with sign form as well?
A	yeah
E	that was my sort of hypothesis in my thesis statement
A	so do you know sign language?
E	er I did level one BSL but that was like ten years ago so I've I've forgotten a lot
A	yeah
E	but I did my course I didn't really have to but I did a BSL level one course to inform my dissertation erm and did really well in the end by my my supervisor for that so that was why he cos language play was one of his specialist areas
A	mm
E	and then he actually left and he went to the
E	and he's done so much stuff in linguistics and he's looking to maybe retire next year
A	mm
E	and I saw him yesterday at
A	ah
E	at the conference yeah erm because he was doing some sort of colloquium or something
A	yeah
E	and it was just so nice to see him
A	ah
E	and so like so I've got I've got people like that from uni who stick in my mind who we've kept in touch with like
A	I don't have those
E	but I didn't have like wild eccentric types
A	I I don't have any I think one of the problems cos when we went to
E	mm
A	I was really struck and a bit jealous by the the
E	mm
A	like they were all friends and I could see that you would he would email the professors and tell them how he was getting on
E	yeah
A	but the problem with how we did it was that you had different you had a different supervisor from a different college every term so first of all you only had like eight supervisions with most of them
E	mm mm
A	erm of an hour so and they were quite close like
E	mm
A	you you know it was just you
E	mm
A	so you were talking to them one to one but erm there was that but then a lot of them are also really intimidating
E	yeah
A	they're not as people but like as in nineteen-year-olds
E	no but they're clearly so far away from your realms
A	exactly and they're and they're not like and and and also you feel like a very small fish
E	yeah
A	like I I didn't until I did well until my second year exams I felt like I was one of the dumbest people in the year
E	mm
A	which made me think why would they want to have a relationship with me like
E	yeah
A	there's
E	yeah
A	who are like getting who who I would listen to and think god they're so much smarter than me but like and they were the ones who had the close relationships with the
E	mm
A	professors from the er from early stages
E	that's interesting
A	but they were the ones also who just ended up being was the fact they were more confident
E	yeah
A	and that they had probably come from private school and had
E	yeah had kind of been coached into that mentality already
A	and the they they weren't smarter they were just more articulate
E	yeah
A	because they'd been in situations like a supervision before whereas I'd
E	yeah
A	only ever been in a class
E	yeah
A	of thirty kids it's erm
E	yeah
A	the speaking I'd done had been one point
E	yeah
A	erm when I'd raised my hand
E	yeah
A	whereas they'd clearly had like coaching
E	they'd had one on one tuition
A	yeah
E	yeah
A	erm and so they had that confidence to be like
E	yeah
A	I'm good like
E	yeah
A	and you should wanna know me
E	yeah exactly yeah
A	and that and that thing so I and I didn't really get that until third year like after I had a grade
E	yeah
A	cos we only we only do our first official exams at the end of second year
E	oh okay
A	and they examine the whole of the first two years
E	wow
A	erm so and then you get a grade and then that's part one
E	and then you feel like you've got kind of something to justify your
A	yeah
E	your confidence in your own abilities yeah
A	yeah it's like
E	wow
A	erm and I was like I was like what?
E	that's fantastic
A	and I thought I'd been the worst out of five
E	mm
A	and I was actually the best grade wise
E	wow
A	erm which is really good but it's also surprising and at that point I had a lot more confidence but then
E	yeah
A	only had a year left so
E	but then he also
A	yeah
E	lies in the potential to do something rather than having already done something IE read a bunch of books and learned another
A	yeah
E	so I think and that's what shines through when you're under like intense pressure in exam conditions
A	mm
E	because you can't just you you you do need the knowledge but you also need to be able to apply it in a way that's appropriate for that context
A	mm
E	and that's not something everyone can do so
A	and the other thing is is a lot of the people who've been very closely coached in school didn't know how to organise their time
A	and like
E	wow
A	so if you if you'd been spoon fed
A	I know
E	I haven't had lunch yet sorry
A	oh my god oh we should stop we should stop because I have to go as well
E	okay
A	erm yeah
E	alright how do we stop it?
