B	but maybe it was her just accepting
A	no but it wasn't that like
B	it was literally just like confused
A	it was like really like
B	maybe it was literally like one of you should have said something in the moment when and you missed it

A	yeah
B	and erm how at first he found it really creepy that this guy like no he was like an erm embalmer and then like
A	yeah
B	she sent him to live with his psychologist
A	really?
B	and like the names have been changed but it's all true and the
A	yeah
B	erm he got sued the psychiatrist sued him and said like you've ruined my business and like it's
A	yeah
B	erm but Augusten Burroughs like refused and just paid him loads of money because was like no it's true this is my
B	principles and then he like
A	oh
B	he like was like this is erm this is like a victory for free speech and stuff
A	wow
B	cos he didn't wanna he didn't wanna like go back and
A	what like because of money now?
B	yeah so he paid him like I don't think it was like it was like er fifty thousand dollars that that actually doesn't seem like that much
A	yeah
B	but like or something like that and but like he just refused to like accept he just refused to say
A	wow
B	the point was that that it was kind of done with the psychiatrist is like he was saying even though my name's been changed everyone will know it's me
A	yeah
B	but then it's well now everyone will know it's you
A	yeah
B	and not just like your family and friends cos he could have just moved to a new town
A	what so did the psychiatrist like do stuff? or was it more just like
B	I don't yeah I think it was like
