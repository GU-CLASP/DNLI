A	tread water
B	so you just have to tread water for twenty minutes?
A	swim for twenty minutes and then tread water for three
B	oh right
A	that's easy
B	right
A	and the fact that
B	yeah
A	um
B	okay
A	from now
B	yeah
A	so just six seven weeks
B	yeah
A	I could I
B	absolutely
A	imagine if I'd not started doing this in January?
A	can you imagine if right now oh it's getting a bit closer I've passed my recruit test I should start training now?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you'd have to go every single day
A	and your legs'd think your probably legs'd just fall off
B	yeah
A	you'd just wake up one morning and you'd be legless
B	legless
A	yes
B	mm
A	I've just sent
A	I hope so
unknown_female	oh
A	freezing
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	basically that's it
unknown_female	love you
B	mm
A	love you
B	hm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	fuck that for a game of soldiers
A	this girl's a massive limp lettuce
B	yep
A	she's twenty-six and she's still working at uni
B	I was gonna say
A	and he won't have achieved anything
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but that's nothing that's gonna keep him there and interested long-term
A	no
B	and if she were living here it might be a very different story
A	I bet if she was living here he'd get bored of her very quickly
B	I can definitely say that's true
A	like it's all lovely now cos she's
B	mm
A	Cos she gets to go at the student union
B	oh nice
A	yeah
B	mm
A	either way
B	mm
A	and do you think he he'd be so excited to go there? No
B	yeah
A	so
B	oh huh
A	yep
B	yeah
A	and which makes me
A	have the fat comment
B	well I mean and
A	and
B	and the anger isn't directed at her
A	yeah
B	for being a douchebag
A	yeah
B	and
A	and at least she's not hot
B	she's not
A	can you imagine if he walked
B	well
A	oh
B	all the time
A	oh
B	girl who is fat and horrible
A	huh
B	absolutely detested each other at college
A	huh
B	but they broke up last year
A	Good
B	and I said well at least she's a hound
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	you'd want them to go for someone hot because then it means that they find hot women what you perceive to be hot attractive
A	yeah
B	and therefore you know that you're hot
A	yeah
B	all these types of things
A	yeah
B	like you don't wanna think that their taste is munters
A	well that's the thing
B	so
A	make me sound awful but I kind of thought well apart from Tom who's gonna be biased because it's his girlfriend's friend
B	mm
A	and he must still think it anyway
B	you're completely different though
A	no
B	whereas you very much are
A	mm
B	I mean obviously all girls have a similar look in the sense that they've all got boobs and a vajayjay
B	do you know what I mean? Like I don't think they would compare the two of you
A	freaking hope not
B	mm
A	Cos last time he saw me
B	yeah
A	so I wanted
B	your body shape has changed a lot hasn't it
A	I wanted to parade
B	yeah
A	no
B	no it has
A	I can see my waist more now
B	mm
A	I wanted to parade
B	mm
A	so that there was no comparison between us
B	mm
A	at all
B	mm
A	which makes me sound shallow but I don't care
B	well at this point you know it's huh there's no rule book
A	mm
B	you're sort of making it up as you go along
A	and seeing as if you do say something you don't get a reply
B	yeah
A	I'm just sending a message saying has
B	he absolutely has  he absolutely has  We had a word with each other
A	oh thank God for that
B	I spoke to Nicky
A	oh don't
B	so Friday she's er she wants to go out
A	shit
B	she said without much success so far
A	mm
B	both the Friday and Saturday
A	yeah
B	then a cocktail or two after
A	yep
A	mm
B	and Dom boyfriend
A	jeebus
B	you'd be very welcome to come on the Saturday
A	yeah

A	yeah
B	enjoy myself
A	yep
B	and then I've got  I've got  to go out on Saturday
A	whilst I would love to I think my bank balance is gonna have to say no
B	well if it were me I wouldn't go

B	yeah
A	it's not okay
B	it's not okay
A	some guy that I was talking to on the internet um wanted me to go to a gig in
B	right

A	as a first date
B	quite a long drive isn't it
A	isn't it
A	that's what I said
B	yeah
A	so by the by doesn't seem that far to me

A	yeah
B	mm
A	I could get lost
B	mm
A	with
B	he might kill you

B	it's really rough
A	is it?
A	huh
B	you would not go

B	it was fucking scary
A	right
B	oh what was it called? There was a really awful awful club like sort of similar to
A	I'll get I'm gonna get the name
B	I'm gonna and I'm gonna say do not go cos you'll die
A	shit
B	although if it's  if it's  a gig it's probably just a pub or something
A	mm
B	and it'd be cheap
A	oh I won't be paying for it
B	fine
A	mm
B	but whenever I go and see Rob it's not  it's not  that far
A	it's about fifteen pounds I think in diesel
B	yeah
A	about fifteen quid
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	be nice to get out of the house
B	mm
A	Cos it'd be twenty quid for the weekend
B	yeah
A	Cos he'd pay for drinks and tickets and everything

A	er I don't I think it's a local band
B	mm
A	I did I said what type of music is it? And he said er
B	death metal
A	rock pop
B	oh
A	I was like mm
B	er could be a bit
A	in my head that's along the the lines of like Blink 182
B	mm
A	not very good with music genres at all
B	well rock pop covers like a multitude of sins doesn't it
A	mm
B	could literally be anything

B	who who even knows? I mean er it changes well not even within the hour
A	this is crazy shit man
B	well he's a glutton for punishment
A	mm

A	oh I really want in my life right now
B	it costs about one pound fifty
A	ah
B	it's not that you know
A	no
B	and it's more expensive than coffee but if you were to get that in Costa
A	it'd be like a fiver
B	it'd be like a fiver
A	that is very restrained of you
B	but there are definitely gonna be cakes in the office tomorrow
B	and I'm definitely gonna go to the gym tomorrow
A	oo
B	Danny
A	the pipes the pipes are calling
A	that'd be good
B	what's that one is it Peter Kay? Stand-up where he sings Danny Boy

B	the first time I watched that I was absolutely crying with laughter
A	yeah
B	everybody calls it that
A	yeah
B	no exactly
A	but um
B	and it
A	but certainly when it first came out it was like my favourite
B	and everyone was repeating it
A	cake
B	A cake with a cheese
A	yeah
A	guess who's died
B	and she was run over by a bus
B	what did you expect? The grim reaper walking along behind her
B	he does an impression of her standing there doesn't he
A	I just
B	oh
A	I like it when he's talking about the
A	Rich Teas
B	again
A	you drop it in
A	mum
A	too late
B	oh it's so funny
A	hobnobs like the SAS

B	mr B Mr B's cabs
A	oh
B	comedy gold
A	mm
B	hundreds
A	it's free
B	it's free
A	it's free money
B	it's er well
A	I dunno about you but as far as I can see that's free money
B	well I would've said so
A	oh yeah
B	that I never see anyone in
A	huh urgh
B	condomy
A	er
A	he doesn't know I call him crazy horse but I quite wanna tell him
B	it's a very appropriate name
A	how long were you volunteering there for?
B	A few months
A	what made you do this?
B	um
A	wow
B	you can basically choose what you wanna do
A	oh yeah
B	all the um teenage girls they're gonna um they're gonna take photos and make um a magazine front cover
A	wow
B	take her Mac and take along like all the software programs that we use like InDesign and put the photos in there
A	mm
B	it's quite a good idea
A	that is a nice thing to do
B	the thing about
A	what?
B	kind of a bit freaky
A	twenty people?
B	like homeless people
A	oh
B	and they they put it down to like the break up of the home
A	yeah
B	and if he has a bit of a break down of like
A	yeah
B	before you know it it's like a really slippery slope
A	yeah
B	you don't see a lot of women
A	yeah
B	I think the idea of it's probably worse than it actually  it actually  is like
A	I'd just be scared of people that are on drugs
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but um yeah
A	yeah
B	if you sleep there you've gotta sleep on the sofa
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I've got to be in with them all
B	with the crazies
A	yeah
B	mm
A	never mind homeless people
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you know you can't sort of volunteer in a shop because you work
A	yeah
B	and you don't have time to do that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	bit of an issue
B	mm
A	I actually watched um a programme recently and basically a bit like Brits Abroad but
B	mm
A	brits going to festivals and getting too drunk
B	oh right
A	and how they got hurt you know smashing their feet in into stuff and
A	just basically being general alcoholics
B	Good
A	and all the people from St John's Ambulance that kind of volunteered did this every year
B	God
A	like they they spent their summers picking up drunkards
B	oh
A	literally picking up drunkards
B	mm
A	like they were getting people that were like shouting cos they were drunk
B	oh God
A	in the herd
B	yeah
A	I just I was watching it and they were like well you know they'll get more out of this than coming to the show itself
B	yeah
A	generous thing to do
B	what people like that do is amazing isn't it really
A	every time
B	the occasional times that I would get really smashed at when I was at uni and you know they they were always there  they were always there  outside the student union every night just to make sure everyone was okay
A	do you wanna try the
B	um
A	do you want to have a smell of it and see what
B	yeah
unknown_female	how are you

B	why's it nutritiously delicious? Cos it's oats?
A	full of vitamins
B	huh
A	yeah
B	is it actually actually a source of calcium?
A	I think I might've made a bit too much here to be fair
B	get it down you
A	but you know I can always have a rest and come back to it later can't I
B	does smell nice
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's like it's warm and malty and chocolatey and
B	what do I do with it? Four teaspoons
A	just put four teaspoons and then milk
B	little bit of milk
A	little bit of milk
B	still haven't bought milk
A	yep
B	thanks mate
A	you might as well just use it cos er it'll just go out of date
A	May already be out of date and I'm secretly poisoning you
B	until one of us dies
A	until one of us keels over
B	that's from a film actually isn't it
A	until one of us dies?
B	oh
A	mm mm
B	oh
A	mm
B	dunno if you've ever watched
A	I saw the one with Queen Victoria in
B	er
A	I've seen a couple of those
B	Elizabeth
A	oh sorry
B	um so that's the second series
A	mm
B	anyway it's
A	that's really annoying me now
B	eighteen forties or something
A	need some water
B	yeah
A	I mean I'd get
A	oh
B	oh
A	mm
B	right
A	yep
B	um
A	oh right
B	they all play
A	yeah
B	Tony Robinson who plays Baldrick
A	extras as well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and they do extras
B	short planks
A	is that the one that was on Time Team?
B	yeah
A	got it
B	Tony Robinson
B	and
B	no no the letter
B	what? My breakfast always starts with a letter
B	it's so funny
A	that's really good
B	I really  I really  would recommend it
A	mm
B	and the last episode in the every episode they're basically trying to find a way of getting out of being in the trenches
A	right
B	wants to live quite badly
A	do you know I might have seen somebody talk about this on the TV before
B	yeah
A	and then play that clip
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and er then then it all just fades
A	I have heard it before
B	into the poppy fields
A	mm
B	because er I think because up to that point you don't  you don't  see it coming
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I think it was a programme about black humour I watched
B	yeah
A	Cos it had things about Mighty Boosh in it as well
B	mm
A	but that's something I never got into
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah
A	um
A	with Rik Mayall
B	yeah
A	I don't understand where I missed the train
B	well I don't I mean it's just  it's just  people's um humour isn't it
A	yeah
B	you're not  you're not  gonna have it all not everyone's gonna have the same sense of humour
A	well it's
B	um
A	of silly
B	you yeah well that's that's what you like
A	oh
B	luxury Comedy I think you know
A	what was that?
B	you're just being a twat now
A	well done you
B	well
A	mm mm
B	mm
A	little bit of Elizabeth
B	mm
A	little bit of Victorians
B	mm
A	and that's about it
B	I think it's probably the stuff that you learn at school though isn't it
A	no
B	then you wouldn't
A	and I moved schools as well so
B	there's probably gaps there
A	I completely missed like they were studying the Aztecs in the secondary school
B	mm
A	they were studying Tudors again
B	oh
A	so I I got two lots of the same thing
B	mm
A	and missed like two years of history
B	mm
A	out of the four that I did so
B	mm
A	really bad
B	that's that's the danger with the curriculum
A	mm
B	so yeah that is quite hard
A	like what happened after Victorians?
B	oh that
A	what was here after that? Cos as far as I'm concerned that was the end of it
B	well no no well er
A	victorians there's us
B	well Victoria died in nineteen O one didn't she
A	all the children
B	a lot of children that died
A	mm
B	it was George the fifth after Victoria
A	so that's him?
B	well no he's the one who came after
A	oh yeah
B	why can't you speak? It was George the fifth
B	his name was
A	mm
B	he didn't wanna give her up
A	I heard a bit about that
B	cos she was divorced
A	for her?
B	for her
A	so hang on
B	took the throne
A	so there was the Queen Victoria
B	yep
A	she had all the kids
B	she had all the kids
A	and one
B	George the fifth
A	one of those kids
B	mm
A	it's not helpful is it
B	and they're not even their real names
A	Great
B	Edward was called
A	so actually all the kings have king names as well as their real names?
B	yeah
A	oh great
B	so that's really good
A	so you're going to Victoria
B	mm
A	to he is Queen's speech's dad
B	queen's speech's dad
A	yes
B	so basically
A	oh it's not a big gap then?
B	no
A	yeah
B	um crowned nineteen thirties
A	I only know that one of them was fourteen
B	or just before
A	so the first one was fourteen wasn't it? Nineteen fourteen

B	of the wars?
A	of all the wars

B	I dunno

B	right
A	I mean my grandma died when I was like three
B	yeah
A	never met my grandad
B	mm
A	he was in the RAF
B	oh right
A	so all those stories you get fed
B	okay
A	I never had any contact with any of it at all
B	yeah
A	from the newspaper
B	oh yeah

B	a bit like a rat
A	we had the world's boringest history teachers known to man ever
B	well you see that will do it
A	they're just
B	history itself is really interesting I think
A	mm
B	I think
A	mm
B	well
B	like the Peasants' Revolt in like thirteen twenty
A	mm
B	who the hell gives a fuck
A	but when you're a kid you don't know which one's important
B	no
A	and you just absorb which one you enjoyed being taught the most I suppose
B	absolutely
B	oh right
A	he said lol

B	mm
A	mm
B	this is  this is we  we know this
A	what the hell's Wessex?
B	Wessex? Um
A	oh
B	er what do you call it? The Saxons once they'd yeah Alfred the Great
A	right
B	so there there wasn't like a king of a united England
A	how long ago is this?
B	well this is the eighth century
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	shabs
B	yeah
A	aren't Romans near that time?
B	romans were before this
A	romans were before that?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	so in that time we've had Saxons
A	saxons
B	so the German the French and the Norwegians
A	I really wanted to learn about them
B	I suppose they all do
A	alive?
B	yeah
A	er
B	they thought it
A	it's your time to go now
A	um just about to have my tea
B	yeah
A	get yourself in your ship
B	it's time for you to go now
B	you won't be alive much longer anyway
B	yeah
A	and
A	fancy a funeral anybody?
B	wilfric
A	guess who's dead? No one
B	it's your time
B	Ethelwulf
A	Ethel is a man?
B	Ethel
A	oh
B	Egbert
A	humperdinck
B	that's er
A	nearly
B	then Alfred the Great
A	yep
B	then you had the Stuarts
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yep
B	but I dunno why
A	mm
B	so it must be something to do with where she comes from
A	yep
B	so why she's a Stuart I don't know
A	Anne Boleyn's German?
B	huh? She's Stuart
A	Anne Boleyn
B	Anne Boleyn
A	oh Berlin
B	she's not German
A	okay
B	yep
A	yeah
B	James the first
A	yep
B	some descendant of Mary
A	did he not last very long?
B	he didn't last very long either
A	yeah
B	he was James the sixth of Scotland but James the first of England
A	yep
B	it's all a bit confusing
A	is that Robin Hood?
B	that's not Robin Hood
A	do you think that's?
B	no
A	oh
B	that's definitely not Robin Hood
A	right
B	I'm the king
A	yep
B	and people went
A	and everyone said no
B	that's very interesting
A	God says this
B	yeah
B	it's something  it's something  like that
A	right
B	like to the point where I think he used to flagellate self-
A	puritan?
B	um
A	to the extreme
B	yeah
A	right
B	his son came back
A	what?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	to Charles the first
A	mm
B	all pretty gruesome
A	I don't know anything about those lot
B	I don't really know anything about that lot either
A	right
B	this is all the bit that I don't really know
A	oh
B	it's weird isn't it
A	mm
B	seventh's reign
A	mm
B	but not for very long
A	no
B	he must've died straight away
A	shabs
B	and then George the sixth served for a long time
A	there
B	oh right
A	he's from nineteen fifty
B	oh
A	so why's it saying?
B	seventy years this year
A	this this is lying to us
B	Cos I thought he was um crowned in the forties
A	I have no frigging idea
B	I don't think it was the fifties
A	think they're lying to us?
B	it might be the scale
A	name is at the end of the bar
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so George the fifth is the bar above
A	got it
B	we get it
A	George the sixth
B	so it was
A	that tiny little line
B	looks like nine nineteen thirty-eight maybe nineteen thirty-nine to nineteen fifty-two
A	yeah
B	Cos it's isn't it Queenie's is it seventy years?
A	I have no idea
B	sixty years? Cos it was fifty-two she was crowned
A	jeebus
B	so there you go
B	sort of in one ear and out the other isn't it
B	how the hell are you supposed to know?
A	there's a few Victoria's thrown in
A	A couple of Annes
B	couple of Annes
A	and Lizzy
B	it's intense
A	my dad just text me
B	uh
A	shit I don't know if it sent
B	daddy
A	oh
B	get Horlicks
A	all the chocolate
B	that was really nice
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I
B	oh
A	my perfect shot as well
B	yeah you ninny
A	oh huh
B	should go and borrow a
A	back brush?
B	back
B	huh
B	oh you're a
B	oh no
B	now I've got mental images of her upstairs now
B	plaiting it
B	oh urgh
A	that's sick
B	man alive
B	urgh
A	oh
B	um
A	I'm gonna get angry
B	you're gonna get angry
A	yeah
B	because your nose is really itchy
A	well that's what I always say
B	yeah
A	feel a bit coldy
B	yeah
B	like even though they said it was three degrees
A	three degrees?
B	yeah
A	uh
B	oh
A	I feel a bit like snotted up
B	aw
A	not the death
B	oh
A	uh
B	I wonder if I can get out of dinner with
A	um
B	well that's what I'm thinking
A	oo yeah
B	I'll check the old bank balance again tomorrow
B	mm
A	um
B	really?
A	er
B	oh
A	it it was hot enough
B	mm
A	it was  it was  doable
B	mm
A	but he was like he was foreign
B	oh right
A	um
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	and he's doing all these silly stretches and he's doing his ab ab bit on the floor
B	mm
A	grr
A	and then I got on the treadmill and I don't know what they were saying
B	yeah
A	and telling the other guy
B	ah
A	yeah
B	oh
A	which was a bit weird
B	were you going quite fast?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	and then he slowed down a bit
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	win
A	I get really excited
B	nice
A	and because I can barely breath at the time obviously saying that virtually wipes me out
A	um
B	that's a nice feeling though
A	yeah
B	especially if you're looking at them and you would consider them to be quite fit
A	yeah
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	it's more difficult
B	mm
A	what I need to do is put
B	yeah
A	that will help
B	something that actually motivates you
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I notice from his message that he wasn't kind of I maybe will have some time free at some point
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you bell-end
A	you're fucking fantastic you are
B	oh my God
A	what does it say for tomorrow?
B	that's cos of the wind
A	oh I can get on board a bit more with that
B	but that's sorry love
A	I was just gonna say I did nearly die of face ache on the way to work this morning it was that cold
B	it's just my lungs
A	basically get the cycling out of the way tomorrow even if you freeze
B	no
A	oh fantastic
B	but at least that's better than bloody minus one
A	yeah
B	oo
A	has got a massive fifty percent sale on
B	ff
A	it's closing down
B	is it?
A	yep
B	oh my God
A	it's actually properly fifty percent off everything
B	mm
A	but apparently they can't
B	well
A	everything's gotta go
B	okay
A	so I'm gonna pop in and see if there's anything that Kate would like
B	mm
A	seeing as I missed her birthday last month
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	sounds a bit dangerous
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but um I told you about the the mess up with the the girl and the bedrooms and the wedding didn't I
B	oh yeah
A	and how I thought
B	yeah
A	well today
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	and what did he say? Did he kick off?
A	he said what's this? Yeah
B	yeah
A	he's put them under different rate codes and stuff
B	mm
A	for the sake of your revenue that you're harping on at
B	mm
A	for a hundred quid
B	mm
A	you would've given you would've ruined the woman's best day of life
B	absolutely
A	get it into perspective
B	and from a business perspective lost four grand
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? If she'd walked away
A	yeah
B	she was frazzled
A	yep
B	you know as we can't keep this booking
A	and also
B	bless you
B	bless you
A	oh
B	mm
A	and should one tiny little thing go wrong
B	mm
A	it's gonna be me that gets it in the neck
B	absolutely
A	God knows what for the sake of what? A hundred quid
B	yeah
A	he would
B	mm
A	the best thing in this situation for you to do is talk to
B	mm
A	he overheard me talking and basically saved my bacon
B	mm
A	and he was like but you know I came back from my lunch and you could've even told me
B	mm
A	I thought no I couldn't cos er you would've if if you wanted to do that
B	mm
A	or if you had any intention of it you could've done it before then when I asked you in the first place
B	mm
A	so er I mean in the end Eve actually had to say
B	oh it's just massive egos isn't it
A	yeah
B	been bruised
A	yep
B	he wants to think that he's running the show
A	yeah
B	and at the end of the day and he probably he he knows he's been caught out
A	yeah
B	he could've actually been a bit more helpful other than
A	well seeing how extreme that situation was
B	yeah
A	and he didn't do anything about it
B	in any business you've gotta make a call haven't you
A	yeah
B	so much money
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yep
B	like there's no sort of grey area with him
A	but he bends it for he bends it
B	mm
A	which with us on conference he's really strict with
B	mm
A	and she had a group booking the twenty rooms and they took one
B	oh
A	and they didn't charge cos they're a corporate client that they didn't wanna piss off
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	but God knows
B	mm
A	and Simon and I both knew
B	mm
A	um but he said basically
B	mm
A	on conference bookings
B	mm
A	which makes sense
B	yeah
A	and obviously for a four grand booking
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's not gonna break the bank
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	three bedrooms
B	you charge sixteen pounds for breakfast?
A	sixteen pound fifty
B	I would literally go in there with my handbag
A	yeah
B	just like that
B	I'd presume they were charging for the day
A	yeah
B	all my food
A	yeah
B	stand there making sandwiches for the day
A	yeah
B	wow
A	yeah

A	nice
B	like a lot of our suppliers already are saying like oh that piece of work falls during the Olympics
A	yeah
B	and he said oh no there's no bank holidays
A	then you'd better guarantee that people are working
B	then you'd
A	mm
B	see it's really unprofessional to say to your  to your  client
A	boss

A	she text him the other day
B	mm
A	no I think she said are you do you still smoke?
B	oh
A	and I don't know if she was gonna pop round and have a cigarette with him
B	that's a bit of a weird question
A	mm
B	maybe it's the her her way of opening up communication channels
A	yeah
B	what?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	what the hell? Why won't you reply? That's obviously her coming and trying isn't it

B	she's not got anything
B	no
A	yeah
B	he's a massive peni
