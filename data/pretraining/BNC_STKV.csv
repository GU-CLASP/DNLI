B	it looked really good
A	it must have been like
B	oh my
A	it's definitely been like

A	I know
B	so yeah we went from seeing like
A	yeah
B	to erm it's cos you work out so early
A	yeah
B	and I'm just like mm
A	oh I'm a bit of a slacker no basically I I stopped paying for
B	okay
A	erm cos I was doing this
A	yeah well cos I was doing this half marathon
B	yeah
A	I wasn't doing I decided to stop lifting
B	yeah
A	like I said and then just focus on the half marathon and that went really really well
B	oh that was so good well done
A	like I generally thought I was gonna die and then when I ran it was fine I was like
B	seriously?
A	I was like why was I worried about this?
B	yeah how long did it take?
A	about two hours fifteen minutes
B	nice that's really good
A	so yeah I was I was happy with it
B	yeah
A	er then I
B	yeah
A	nearly a month ago since I did that even
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah erm like when you do that like surely you stop running at some point
A	no no
B	you don't like what?
A	I ran
B	oh god
A	like I didn't even stop like a little bit like I slowed down I definitely got slower but I I was like so conscious not to stop
B	stop
A	running cos I knew if I stopped I would just end up
B	that was it
A	I I'd walk
B	oh my god
A	so
B	that is amazing
A	yeah
B	I would not be able to do that
A	two er yeah two hours fifteen minutes of nonstop running and like after I got over the finish line I nearly started to cry I was like I'm so emotional right now
B	I I'm not surprised
B	I I would have not been able to have not stop if I did it like
A	I had
B	oh
A	what did I have? I had two bottles of Lucozade and a jelly baby
B	is that it?
A	one jelly baby

B	that would be so yeah
A	I know
B	yeah
A	like they did have Portaloos and stuff but
B	but still that's like cos that that counts

A	which one do you prefer? the ex girlfriend
B	for sure
A	for sure
B	but
A	no
B	erm yeah but like the thing oh I dunno
A	but sometimes long distance relationships are nicer because erm
B	alright
A	I knew but I haven't it's fine
A	erm sometimes long distance relationships are a bit nicer because you like you see them and then you have fun and then you leave you have your own life
B	mm yeah
A	that's what I like
B	yeah we we were long distance before but now we're really long distance so that now it would be like easier because we're so far away that you can't
A	yeah
B	just keep coming back
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	whereas before we were I was still able to like
A	yeah
B	meet up and out
A	yeah no I completely agree
B	yeah
A	like I loved when I was with
B	yeah exactly
A	so
B	I know
A	I get that
B	so what about you anyone?
A	erm no so obviously I was seeing
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	thing? like
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and then like a week later I was on the train with
B	wow
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	and so basically it kind of was like and
B	mm
A	and she obviously knew that
B	yeah
A	and no one told me and I was just like
B	that's not but yeah
A	like why
B	yeah
A	why do you think you have to hide this? like
B	yeah
A	I don't care like you not telling me it made like an issue
B	that was what
A	out of it
B	like that's what's
A	yeah
B	that you're like your friends that they tell you this stuff
A	yeah it's like
B	just so you don't feel like an idiot
A	yeah exactly
B	like yeah
A	like I don't care that he's seeing
B	mm
A	or that she's seeing him like
B	yeah
A	massive secret
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	by not telling
A	that's annoying
B	it makes it a thing
A	yeah it makes it an issue
B	and then you're not yeah like you're fine with it
A	yeah
B	but
A	so I sent him a message I was like you know obviously we're in the same group and I found out obviously you're dating
B	mm
A	I don't want there to be any awkwardness like
B	yeah like
A	we're probably gonna bump into each other at some point like
B	exactly
A	I don't want any weirdness like
A	I don't care
B	tell them like yeah
A	yeah so and that was fine and then oh my ex boyfriend
B	yeah
A	dumped his girlfriend who came over from Australia and they moved into an apartment together like a month ago
B	oh is it cos he was always texting you?
A	yeah
B	what's gonna happen there?
A	he's gonna
B	what okay
A	he is gonna come and visit me I think
B	okay yeah
A	but I don't
B	so yeah like
A	thing is though like
A	I don't it sounds really slutty is
B	no oh come on
A	I don't yeah true
A	coming yeah like
B	I thought it was
A	oh like I don't wanna be with him
B	yeah
A	and I don't want to be in a relationship really
B	no
A	but I wouldn't quite mind just sleeping with him
B	why is that
A	yeah
B	so
A	like I have no problem with him coming here and us having fun and us being friends and like having a bit of
B	yeah
A	sexy time that doesn't bother me
B	exactly yeah
A	but I don't want him to come down and like want to be in a relationship because I just don't want to I don't want to like
B	no
A	I'm not ready for that I like being single I don't have the time
B	yeah
A	like nearly every weekend between now and Christmas I'm doing something like
B	yeah it and that's the thing isn't it? it's like when you have er I think we
A	mm
B	you know to do stuff soon as you're in a relationship you stay you stay in don't you?
A	yeah you just stay in and you don't do anything and he's long distance
B	yeah
A	and he was like he's
B	so where does he live?
A	he lives in
B	yeah
A	it's about two hours up the A1
B	oh so that is like
A	like it's far away
B	yeah
A	and we did it like we obviously did long distance for a long time and stuff erm but I just I don't trust him at all like
A	l
B	I I would like
A	I I have
A	no faith in him
B	but fine for
A	as a boyfriend
B	just have a little
A	yeah
A	but like
B	like
A	I can't say that to anybody like
B	yeah well
A	I can say it to you but
B	if
A	yeah
B	just be like well
A	like
B	shut up
A	I'm quite happy
A	for him to come down here
B	yeah
A	and for us to have some fun
B	yeah
A	and like get together and stuff cos I'm sorry no one turns down sex no one turns down sex
B	exactly
A	but
B	or if they do they're
A	yeah or they're really ugly
B	yeah
B	but the good thing is with that as well is that
A	yeah
B	there's no like having to like
A	and there's no awkwardness between us
B	I'm gonna refill this
A	okay
B	are you up for some more?
A	oh I'm so up for some more yoghurt yeah
B	always up for yoghurt
A	always up for yoghurt
B	that is pretty
A	that is talented yoghurt balancing
B	I was gonna be like that is skills
B	but
A	so yeah kind of seeing me and you in the same boat
B	yeah er pretty much yeah
A	the exes are coming back to haunt us a bit
B	and the thing is what's bad is that like part of it is kind of tempting
A	mm
B	and part of it is really not tempting
A	mm well yeah I'm having like a massive this is gonna sound really lame and dramatic but like a massive like inner conflict like a part of me
B	I
A	like it's really it's like it's quite overwhelming like
B	I know
A	I haven't seen him in two years and now suddenly
B	that is a long time
A	yeah he wants to come down and he keeps sending me messages like you know you our my our friendship's really important and like
B	yeah
A	you're so close to
B	did you love him?
A	yeah he was the first person I ever loved
B	so that's so that is I think again it's so unlike us to talk like this
A	I know tell
B	but I think if you do cos if you
A	no
A	yeah like I
B	really? okay
A	like I don't fall in love very quickly it takes me a long time but yeah he was important to me we dated for four years he was the first person I ever loved
B	okay
A	but I just don't trust him as far as I can throw him
B	no I mean I
A	I just whatever he says to me I would not I
B	no
A	wouldn't believe
B	I
A	so
B	is it because of the stuff he was texting you when he was with
A	yeah well
B	that girl?
A	yeah partly that and partly he's I just don't think he's I think he's not a very sincere person
A	like the amount of time he's been like he kind of has like this friendship cycle with me he'll talk to me loads and loads and loads and loads and then suddenly something will happen and he'll be like I can't talk to you anymore blah blah blah
B	mm
A	and then he'll just like ignore me and then he'll come crawling back
B	why does he say he can't talk to you?
A	erm
B	okay
A	like he came back from Oz he was like you know we had a massive argument I was like you're being a dick like
B	yeah
A	you should not be bringing this
A	yeah
B	oh so that's er erm
A	I was like I was like you I have been your friend for the whole time you've been in Australia
B	mm
A	and now you're coming back and you're ignoring me
B	yeah
A	and he was like but I don't have to talk to you all the time just because we're friends doesn't mean I have to make you a priority and I was like well like a week ago you were telling me how much you missed me
B	yeah
A	and now you're bringing your girlfriend over like
A	you're a dick and so we stopped talking then
B	yeah
A	and he was in my
B	yeah
A	at like three in the morning so obviously and he sent me a message the next day being like I was really worried about you but my girlfriend thinks it's really inappropriate you were calling me and I was like I called you? oh shit
B	oh shit
A	so then obviously he was like you know my girlfriend would rather us not talk and I was like yeah that's fine doesn't bother me
B	yeah yeah
A	he then sent me a text message on my birthday saying I hope you have an amazing birthday I just want you to know that I care like you mean so much to me but please don't reply to this text message
B	oh that's
A	I was like
B	how are you supposed to read into it?
A	exactly
A	no
B	do you not?
A	I don't think he wants a relationship
B	sounds like he needs to be single but like he
A	yeah I think he does like I think he definitely needs to be single for a good long time
B	I think as well by you not wanting to be in a relationship with him will only want er
A	I think so yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	like yeah
A	like
B	so when when if you when
A	I love how you went
B	you really like
A	like not even like if you sleep you were like when you sleep with him
A	this is
B	I'm just doing this
A	yeah
B	cos I'm an independent woman
A	exactly like boom boom boom
B	yeah this isn't because like
A	yeah
B	basically you you're in control
A	yeah like and I'm not just saying it cos I know some girls'd be like oh I don't wanna get back with him and then like a week later they go back to him
B	yeah
A	but I genuinely really
B	no no no no
A	don't
B	no
A	like
B	it's just hard when there is like
A	and also I haven't had sex since like July like
B	yeah
A	like
A	I'm a little bit horny okay?
B	yeah
B	and you'll be like
A	hello get your clothes off
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he'll be like
A	yeah so
A	that was fun
B	yeah
A	have a half an hour break?
B	that'll do yeah exactly
B	erm oh and that would be
A	well I've timed it well
B	okay oh yeah
A	yes because he's coming on Halloween
B	oh okay
A	and I've been invited
B	wow
A	really really weirdly to so the girl so
B	mm
A	is having a Halloween party and she invited everybody else like three weeks ago and then suddenly Sunday morning she had and she sent me an invite as well so I was like
B	oh thank you
A	and like I had known about this for ages cos everyone was like
B	yeah
A	are you going to
B	no did you think it was weird that you hadn't been invited?
A	yeah a little bit
B	cos you had no idea
A	yeah I had no
B	like why like why
A	and she'd and like she'd come to the girls' night when we had the the dinner and stuff like
B	oh was she there?
A	yeah
B	which one was she?
A	she was the one with like brown hair glasses had her hair scraped back
B	oh that's her?
A	yeah erm
B	she's got nothing on you I must say
B	yeah
A	but so
B	oh okay
A	she'd invited randomly invited me to this and I was like oh okay so I have to look fabulous obviously
B	obviously
A	obviously fabulous
B	obviously
A	erm I'm gonna wear a jacket but without like a bra and then just like
B	oh that's
A	tit tape it down
B	yes yeah
A	gonna do that
B	and what are what are you being?
A	oh I'm gonna buy one of these like erm I gonna paint my face white and then you can buy like erm it's not paint but it's like paint like stickers that you kind of like like erm kind of like transfer tattoos that they peel off and
B	okay
A	so it's like the like a dead skull like
B	okay
A	but with more like embroidered like a flower type
B	okay like a skull er what are they called? skull cap
A	the rose of the
B	I
A	sugar skull yeah
B	sugar skull oh
A	yeah candy skull
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'm gonna have one of those and then have like maybe get like purple contact lenses
B	so that's gonna end up like all over the
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	are you gonna take that off before you do it like? I just
A	well yeah obviously
A	I'm not gonna like have sex with that on my face
B	I know
A	this could be a very messy
B	yeah
A	moment
B	yeah maybe
A	so
B	it's a fantasy maybe he'll like it
A	maybe but erm I'm kind of hoping that with that on my face it means that we can't kiss
B	oh that's cool even though I bet you that will still break cos whenever I do that I always wear red lipstick
A	ah
B	and I'm like don't do it and as soon I wear lipstick it's guaranteed to
A	and the girls just flock to you
A	cos like one hot
B	yeah oh mm
A	erm so yeah I've timed it so
B	okay oh
A	and then come to this Halloween party with me

A	selling it as let's hang out with friends at a party
B	yeah yeah
A	while actually being like I look amazing
B	and yeah
A	I have quite a good looking boy with me in your face
B	yeah definitely
B	no I just think that's really like why to not
A	yeah
B	and then let alone to find out
A	secret
B	I hate people keeping secrets
A	same like I just don't care like why do you feel like?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah I'm dating
B	mm
A	why why tiptoe around it? like and like
B	mm
A	who's like one of my like good friends she was just didn't even tell me
B	that would really really annoy me
A	yeah
B	although she's quite like erm
A	no she's well
B	like that maybe? like kind of
A	I I think in a way she's
B	in a French way I dunno
A	I think in a way she kind of liked having a secret
B	mm
A	she was like I did it to protect you I was like no offence but do I come across as a person who needs
B	er yeah
A	protecting?
B	yeah yeah
A	like come on
B	mm
A	so
B	oh
A	mm
B	like rather than like cos exactly you don't need protecting you're gonna be like
A	yeah
B	like
A	very weird
B	mm
A	and I bumped into her we went to watch the rugby two weeks ago
B	mm
A	the Wales match and
B	who did that?
B	so at that stage you did or didn't know?
A	I knew but she I don't think
B	she didn't know that you knew
A	she knew that I knew and I'm just like
B	okay
A	why is this so convoluted? like
B	I know
A	I don't care
B	care
B	literally
A	like stop pretending you're my best friend
B	wait till Halloween walking out with him
A	oh
B	yeah
A	exactly I'm just gonna I'm gonna smash it out the ballpark
B	mm
A	in my head I look amazing on the day I'll probably look shit
B	oh shut up the only thing is in a way why don't you kiss him at the party? cos it's it's like it's just like and it's hot and it's like just like it's like that guy's
B	like literally literally I'm just having fun
A	I will debate it
B	yeah that's the only thing I'm thinking use him as like a bit
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so how did you and like your girlfriend kind of or your ex girlfriend kind of rekindle rekindle the flame?
B	yeah so erm she messaged me erm a
A	mm
B	around the time when I was saying
A	yeah
A	yeah

A	some guy I was like oh
B	it's like
A	oh great
B	erm but it's quite hard if you don't like just going on out
A	yeah you can't I don't think you can get to meet someone and
B	no
A	know their personality just by going clubbing
B	no
A	it's like you have to
B	no
A	meet them in an environment like like a gym or
B	yeah
A	work or something but
B	see there's the thing we're missing out yeah even though if you go at like six in the morning
A	yeah
B	and then not come in
A	it's just cos I just didn't wanna pay twenty pounds when I couldn't really use it cos I was
B	yeah
A	running so much
B	because
A	yeah
B	my like weight has gone down quite well not quite a lot actually
B	yeah
A	I'm doing okay I just didn't wanna keep paying for fuel when
B	yeah
A	I could build it back up at the gym at work
B	so the gym at work is pretty bog standard work
A	yeah they've got bars they've got
B	okay
A	weights they've got rowing machines they've got
B	then it's kind of
A	everything really
B	hard to justify isn't it?
A	yeah even though it's only twenty pounds to join it's still like
B	yeah yeah
A	it's right on my doorstep like I can just
B	yeah
A	go at lunchtime and have like
B	yeah
A	an hour session and a quick shower then back to work
B	and then you're yeah
A	I've done it
B	how is work going?
A	work's fine yeah we're like a restructure
B	okay
A	but erm I don't think they're gonna make anybody redundant
B	okay that's good
A	like I'm not worried about it
B	okay that's good
A	erm but I think next year I will leave in June
B	oh
A	and either go to Australia with
B	oh wow
A	or go to or go travelling from June till September and then go back to university
B	okay wait from June to September then uni again
A	yeah
B	where would you go to uni?
A	er well I wanna do psychology
B	okay
A	and then I want to do like a masters in psychology like maybe neuro psychology or
B	wow so wait so starting a fresh degree again?
A	yeah
B	why?
A	well I didn't complete I couldn't complete my online one
B	yeah
A	because it was too much work they wanted fifteen hours a week
B	yeah
A	and I just couldn't fit it in
B	no that was
A	with all the running training and stuff I couldn't do it
B	yeah
A	but I still really wanna do it
B	yeah
A	and I know I know that I really wanna do it and it's just whether it go to Australia and go travelling for a year first and then go and like in
B	yeah
A	September two thousand and seventeen or whether I do just three months' travelling and go September
B	and then just erm
A	yeah go September fifteen er sixteen sorry
B	yeah and get going with it
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah would you go back to
A	no because
B	okay and then
A	so and then you can do the specialism
B	okay okay yeah
A	so they condense the three year course into like a one year
B	right
A	masters basically
B	okay but you've got the experience of your past degree
A	yeah
B	like so
A	and like
A	it's good and I really wanna I really want to do it is why
B	good for you
A	just but I've just gotta plan what to do whether I want to go
B	yeah
A	this year or next year well next year or the year after sorry and
B	oh
A	so she has to go back to Oz
B	no that is really bad
A	she was really upset really really upset about it
B	ah
A	it was like a really bad she like
B	yeah
A	and she came round mine and we were sitting just in the Morrisons carpark in
B	you knew they was gonna be
A	yeah it's like I think I'm actually in love with him
B	I I didn't even know her I met for one
A	mm
B	and the way she talked I was like I could I could
A	you can just tell
B	I knew that oh shit
A	and he just he's dating like two girls at the moment
B	he's not ready at all
A	and she's like and like he's even like Facebook friends with one of them I'm like
B	mm
A	I know that Facebook friends is stupid
B	yeah
A	but it's still like you know
B	yeah
A	she's yeah
B	the thing is as well like he won't realise it until she's gone
A	exactly
B	probably and when he's older then he'll be like but she she's like almost grown up and like the perfect package
A	yeah exactly
B	but like
A	but he's thirty next year he's thirty in January like
B	oh shit
A	it's just like boy you like she's right in front of you
B	she's right yeah
A	like literally
B	literally
A	right in front of you every day
B	oh god and you know like you can live together like if you
A	yeah like you know you yeah you know they can live together they know that they have this like amazing relationship friendship
B	yeah
A	they like trust each other
B	that's the hard bit so
A	yeah like
B	yeah
A	he's never ever like made a move on her not once
B	no
A	like apparently once they like snuggled in bed together once and that was it
B	okay
A	like he's never tried to kiss her he's never tried to do anything
B	you know that it's
A	yeah
B	what like you would like kind of know like he really didn't like put it that way
A	it's just so annoying
B	shit that was a bad day for her
A	yeah it was a very emotional day it was a very
B	oh
A	but it was the Bake Off that day so she had a little bit of
B	okay
A	like enjoyment
B	a glimmer of oh
A	a glimmer yeah
B	but that is pretty rough going though
A	yeah
B	erm well I I guess then if you can go out with her it's kind of
A	if I've always wanted to go to Oz like I'm I've never really been to the
B	yeah
A	apart from to Dubai but that was only to the airport
A	when I was flying to China so
B	okay yeah I'm not sure if it'll really count
A	yeah
B	yeah like
A	yeah I've been there for like an hour
B	yeah
A	yeah so yeah so work is fine but then I kind of have like this end date in my mind
B	end date so
A	yeah
B	then it's
A	yeah
B	quite hard to really care about it isn't it?
A	yeah erm
A	it's like so
B	yeah so you need like have you got any idea where you wanna go?
A	yeah I think either
B	okay
A	or
B	oh
A	like I I'm a bit of a
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I don't want to go
B	yeah
A	but a lot of erm like more popular universities don't do the conversion course
B	okay
A	so I have to go and do the conversion course at like
B	and then you can do
A	and then I can go to a better uni yeah
B	okay
A	er the well the
B	okay
A	so erm how you can tell someone's lying by their face and their body movements and
B	yeah all their yeah
A	stuff like that
B	that really
A	and that really interests me
B	like that well it does but then it also I'd go ah no
A	yeah you'd be able to tell
B	like
A	all the time if someone was lying
B	I know but can you though? like what if they're
A	yeah you
B	a really good liar?
A	I think yeah well you have to train to be a really good liar
B	yeah oh god
A	like people I know it's creepy isn't it?
B	like I like I'd hate it like
A	just imagine going on a date with somebody who was like a trained lie detector you'd be like you'd be fucked
B	it would be you
B	like online dating you'd be like
A	liar
B	no way
B	like I when we meet up I will be able to tell
B	if you're like bullshitting me
A	you look lovely you're lying to me
B	like and like oh god it would be horrible
B	oh
A	but I
B	yeah
A	that academy erm
B	yeah that would be
A	but then
B	pretty cool though
A	but then
B	okay
A	save some money and then go there
B	that sounds so not a bad idea
A	it's like exactly so
B	why don't you then like do three months in
A	yeah
B	erm and then you're not gonna be too much in debt like
A	exactly yeah
B	people usually start like cos if you think of it
A	exactly travelling is expensive
B	you're getting no money
A	no exactly travelling is expensive and I I know people in Australia and somebody was like well I can give you a job but because of like the stupid travel visa situation
B	mm
A	you can only work for the same company for six months
B	mm
A	and it's like well that's six months of work and then I'm fucked again like
B	and then yeah I think in a way it's better like in some
A	mm
B	what you wanna do
A	yeah
B	do it like
A	exactly yeah
A	no
B	but
A	and it's still three months' travelling I can still
B	still exactly
A	in nine months' time so but
B	and you get such long holidays
A	yeah I could always go back out
B	then you can then just go back out again
A	what about you? what about your university course? are you still doing that or?
B	yeah so erm I'm like so I start PTing in January now
A	that's cool
B	so yeah I'm really
A	yeah
B	or it depends on if those
A	so it
B	you can only you do a UCAS
A	yeah
B	I'm just gonna keep going with it and see when like when I once I've like trained and erm yeah go from there
A	so when you start PT in January is that you training to become a PT or?
B	yeah
A	you oh okay
B	training to be
A	and who are you doing that with?
B	but you can do it at the same time erm
A	oh okay
B	er
A	oh okay
B	erm so yeah I'm really excited it'll be really good but cos I've at first I thought oh why don't I work there? but I don't think I will I'll I'll just go either to a gym that's kind of like the one round the corner where you just have
A	yeah
B	cos I don't I won't have a
A	I'll be your client
B	exactly there we go
B	you're like free PTing
A	woohoo
B	erm so yeah so I'll have that probably and then just like work out if it's people like homes or like
A	yeah
B	like their office gym and stuff like that erm rather than there because like at peak times that place is horrible
A	yeah it is yeah it's heaving isn't it?
B	like how are you supposed to
A	that'll be cool
B	yeah so yeah
A	and also like you know everybody who works there and it's quite
B	and by that stage I might be
A	yeah
A	yeah I don't like you anymore
B	exactly
A	but it's quite insular and you probably want like
B	it it yeah
A	your clients to be
B	yeah
A	to be separate
B	exactly
A	kind of
B	and I think as well like when you know how kind of things are kind of temporary like
A	yeah
B	you kind of outgrow things like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and they think that wouldn't happen but
A	yeah
B	they've got like like that much
A	yeah if you spend a lot of time there and you socialise
B	yeah
A	with the people there and then you start working there like
B	exactly
A	you know I think you probably could get bored
B	yeah and I do get bored
A	and just
B	so easily
A	you just need like friends outside of that and
B	exactly
A	it's kind of like the politics
B	yeah it is
A	or the political side of it isn't it?
B	yeah so I think I'll
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure and
A	so what?
B	again it's just money reasons uni wise because
A	so are you you're not doing a course at the moment or you are doing a course at the moment?
B	I'm doing another like there's a course on the side which is just like
A	oh okay
B	nutrition and
A	yeah
B	food sort of thing but erm but yeah I dunno like it's it's another one like yeah I dunno torn but
A	mm it's always how like cos going back to uni is such a financial and
B	it is
A	like mental commitment
B	yeah
A	like you really need to be focused how the you're going back to uni to learn like
B	exactly
A	as a postgraduate as a graduate you can fuck about but
B	yeah
A	as a postgraduate you've got to be really conscious of it and
B	yeah
A	like you can't just be like oh yeah I'm gonna go out every single day
B	no
A	and
B	the thing is now we can't at this stage
A	yeah exactly
B	but
A	I know it's so stupid like I'm twenty-four years old and I'm still I'm like I'm so old
B	I know
A	like if I go back to uni
B	no
A	then just like ah
B	though when you go out at
A	yeah they are yeah
B	and I'm just like oh I was talking to some guys and they were like eighteen and stuff I was like oh
A	I know I remember going out in Oxford with a friend of mine in freshers' week and there's one boy come over and was like how old are you? I'm like twenty-one and they're like
B	yeah
A	you're so old I was like
B	oh ah
A	it's like dude you're eighteen
B	I know
A	they looked he looked so young it was
B	I know
A	it was embarrassing
B	I I know I didn't get ID'd and I was like what
B	is going on? like
A	but you look really young I think
B	I know
A	I think you look young
B	I know because
A	yeah
B	and er it was quite handy cos one of the girls who like was who was doing the tickets erm goes to one of
A	oh yeah
B	so we all got in for free
A	oh that's cool
A	is
A	oh really?
B	I think he's gone to do
A	ah
B	yeah
A	it's I'm guessing you don't do lifting anymore with
B	no I
A	did you never get back in contact with him?
B	no I no I didn't
B	I know I might yeah no
A	that's the thing like I get like it would be nicer if you did like if you could if you did about two people and it was like forty pounds and you could split it
B	yeah I know
A	twenty pounds each but
B	but like it's and no one does it like
A	no
B	like I in a like a group thing I guess it's not really a group thing
A	no
B	but it's an expensive thing to be really
A	yeah forty pounds a week is like ridiculous
B	yeah it is a lot of money
A	and like yeah I don't have a hundred and sixty pounds a month to spend on it
B	no no
A	like I don't actually know
B	and if you think about that that's a lot
A	how I even afforded it
B	isn't it really?
A	yeah
B	a lot
A	like if you could split then
B	really? yeah
A	so it's still like expensive
B	yeah yeah that's a lot of money
A	yeah like I really enjoyed it but
B	and I think you're right like he was not great at like following through like
A	yeah
B	so if if that was me and someone hadn't contacted back ever and just
A	you would get on to them
B	sort of chase them or
A	yeah
B	like you'd be like oh I hope everything's okay
A	mm
B	like yeah like
A	yeah
B	just cos it's your money isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's so he lost a hundred pounds practically in a week and he didn't really do that much to chase it
A	no to chase it
B	to chase it up
A	but it's like I had a physiotherapy session
B	where was that?
A	well not a physio
B	okay yeah
A	and then it went up to fifty pound and she messaged me she was like
B	yes
A	fifty pounds for an hour sports massage
B	no
A	I just can't
B	yeah it's
A	justify it
B	a lot of money
A	like like I could get like a pair of shoes for that
B	yeah no and that's what's hard now it's like like but the er thing is as well with that is that like cos gyms charge so much to rent
A	yeah
B	so they're already then have to ask so much
A	yeah they do
B	for er when it's it is really hard but it's too expensive
A	yeah and especially in
B	yeah
A	really expensive
B	to rent for sure if they can like it's like four hundred to four hundred and fifty a month and erm erm
A	mm
B	they charge four hundred and you have to work there fifteen hours a week as well
A	wow
B	like crazy
A	yeah
B	this is the cheapest one
B	I'm like I'm not eating this time
B	like
A	no food
A	oh no see I think you'll be a good PT
B	oh thank you yeah
A	I think you care I think you actually care about people
A	and you care about fitness
B	yeah
A	like
B	and I I hope I'm really looking forward to it and I think cos the thing is anyone can be a PT
A	yeah
B	erm but yeah hopefully you can
A	yeah it's like
B	like that's how you
A	eighty percent diet
B	exactly
A	twenty percent actual workout isn't it?
B	that's how you're actually gonna get the
A	yeah
B	results
A	yeah
B	wait now
A	I know I think waiting
B	yeah
A	is the hardest part isn't it?
B	it is yeah
A	it's really annoying
B	that's so exciting though with your psychology thing
A	I've I'm so so keen to
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna go home this weekend and talk to my parents about it
B	yeah
A	just I know like that sounds lame but
B	yeah I would
A	I mean talking to my parents
B	talk to my mum about everything yeah that's
A	I mean talking like important stuff like that through with them I think is
B	yeah
A	is important erm cos it will involve like a financial commitment and I will have to pay for it and it's not just one masters it's two masters
B	yeah
A	so I will probably have to borrow some money from them or my
B	yeah
A	grandparents erm
B	but in the long run
A	but I wanna do it
B	in the long run
A	yeah
B	you'll get a lot more money
A	yeah like I don't
B	hopefully
A	I don't really know where I wanna go with it I know roughly but I'm more doing it because I want I'm interested in it
B	yeah and
A	like
B	that I
A	I'd want to do that
B	and it's like anything if you have an interest in something it's amazing
A	yeah
B	because not many people do really
A	exactly like I like the job I do and I'm good at it
B	yeah
A	not to not to sound you know arrogant but I'm good at it
B	yeah no yeah
A	but it's not what I wanna do for the rest of my life
B	no no
A	and so
B	erm and learning is actually great fun
A	yeah I really enjoy it
B	and like just why not? like
A	exactly and like if I
B	exactly yeah the
A	I think the the it's something like ten months it's a ten month
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	so I can do that
B	and that is nothing really
A	and if not I still have a publishing career of four years
B	exactly
A	to fall back on so
B	yeah
A	it's not I don't think it's bad but
B	I think that's like a great
A	yeah
B	like I think that's awesome
A	like I'm really looking forward to it
B	yeah no you're leaving but yeah
A	oh yeah but I only live like fifteen or twenty minutes down the road so
B	yeah
B	so
A	er
B	okay
A	so
B	so how would you?
A	well you
B	so
A	just go up erm the A14 and then you get onto the M6
B	oh how long will that take?
A	takes about forty minutes
B	oh okay thing is as well when you're going not like to make friends or
A	yeah
B	like the amount of effort is gonna be reduced that
A	yeah
B	because you're not there to like be popular and you're like
A	exactly like
B	you're there to learn
A	it'll be nice to meet people
B	yeah that's
A	but I that was not like I have friends like
B	yeah exactly
A	and yeah I'm going I want to to learn to uni to learn and get a degree like
B	yeah
A	I've been to uni and I've done the whole going out all the time and meeting people and
B	I know and er yeah it's done and that
A	like yeah
B	I think that's quite nice to just check that off and
A	yeah
B	like erm well how will you find moving back home?
A	I think that will be rough
B	yeah
A	like my parents annoy the fuck out of me
B	yeah that will be hard then
A	erm it's also it's really really
B	oh no
A	so her school erm her school became an academy
B	okay
A	and so the academy just came in and basically is just making everybody
B	okay
A	redundant and restructuring so
B	oh that's so shit
A	yeah she's apparently being made redundant and their last day will be the thirty-first of December so start the new year with a bang
B	oh that
A	woohoo
B	that is rough
A	yeah so erm I think
B	oh poor thing
A	and you can only start looking for a job after something like three months or something but
B	really?
A	yeah you can't go you can't look for a new job straight away because you then disqualify your redundancy package so you won't get paid the money basically erm
B	no
A	like I think my dad
B	yeah
A	would go crazy
B	yeah
A	if she was there all the time so
B	yeah
A	but anyway
B	and erm well and they won't mind you coming home?
A	I don't think so
B	no
A	not to go to university like
B	yeah
A	if I went to
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	that would be quite rough
A	but
B	mm
A	erm or I if I'm there two days a week and I stay in
B	yeah but that
A	like four days a week or something
B	cos that was true like the erm hours driving in probably aren't that much
A	yeah exactly which is kind of annoying in a way but
B	cos more of your parents
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think or the conversion course is about five grand which isn't too much
B	five grand? okay
A	yeah
B	that's not too too bad
A	yeah
B	so
A	like a lot of them
B	yeah
A	can be more like law er like a law conversions are like twelve grand
B	they are a lot of money
A	it's ridiculous
B	aren't they? my friend's brother's just done one so
A	no no it's only like law and like
B	okay
A	accounting and stuff I think that are more expensive
B	oh yeah okay
A	but I always wanted to be a lawyer
B	yeah I've always my dream
B	I guess for that cos they've got to cram so much into that
A	yeah
B	oh god
A	but also the amount of money they're gonna make in the future
B	yeah
A	off the back of it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	is gonna be
B	a lot
A	massive
B	yeah
A	like so they can charge that much
B	yeah
A	erm
B	oh that's
A	erm
B	at that place?
A	no I was three year two and a half years at another company and then
B	okay
A	a year and a half if I left in June it would be a year and six months year and
B	okay
A	seven months so altogether
B	well that's quite that's quite nice
A	it comes to about four and bit years
B	erm time to have
A	yeah
B	a change
A	exactly
B	isn't it? yeah
A	yeah but
B	exciting
A	would if you wanted or went to uni would you go to university around here?
B	I would go back here
A	in
B	so I can stay at home
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	from
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but a degree's a degree at the end of the day
A	like
B	yeah
A	so like that's why the conversion course getting it from a polytechnic doesn't bother me
B	no cos you've still got a degree from
A	yeah
B	so
A	exactly and also they're still good universities
B	yeah
A	like
B	really?
A	in the country? which you know it's not the top ten but it's still
B	no but
A	it's top er
B	if you think how many universities
A	exactly
B	there are yeah it's like
A	so it's not they're not
B	no
A	bad unis
B	no
A	they're just it's that historical
B	yeah
A	snobbery
B	it it and it is that's all it is isn't it? it's snobbery
A	yeah
B	but yeah I don't know I think I will probably to be honest I kind of have the idea that I think I'll get stuck into working
A	yeah
B	and erm kind of be like well
A	yeah
B	and hopefully making enough money
A	but you've been successful without a degree so far
B	yeah
A	haven't you? so
B	exactly yeah
A	it's not like you need one
B	and that's the thing I'm just like cos for me it would be three years
A	oh okay yeah
B	I'm just like I would
A	it's a massive commitment
B	quite a lot of time and I'm just like
A	and we all know you're a commitment phobe
B	exactly so so seriously
B	I
B	like a year I would be like okay three years if I'm
A	yeah
B	I don't think I can commit to that
A	yeah no
B	erm cos I'm just like well what if I want to do this? or
A	or want to yeah like it'd be like you fucking hate it yeah
B	I know and I probably will but
B	probably will happen
A	yeah
B	so I think I will probably try and be sensible and in a way not do the uni
A	yeah
B	option
A	but also
B	erm
A	nutrition erm is an industry where you don't necessarily need like if you wanted to go into like you know like
B	it is that
A	football or
B	yeah
A	rugby club
B	yeah
A	like that type of level
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah I don't think like
A	you can be just as successful
B	like like yeah exactly
A	without a degree like
B	yeah
A	people don't care if you've got a degree people care if you even know what you're talking about
B	if you're exactly yeah but I think yeah that's
A	so if I see
B	that better be
B	yeah which be like oh yeah
A	hench
B	yeah way
A	oh
B	yeah so I'm erm I've started in Instagram again and then hopefully will get back into blogging
