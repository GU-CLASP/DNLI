C	I I was gonna I dunno was just gonna ask him
D	in where? oh Pakistan
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I was just gonna ask him cos like when the when the media reported it they were like oh it's because they don't want people to go to school which is not the reason why it happened at all it was because of something else I was just gonna ask him like how
A	oh that's interesting
D	I was gonna ask him how he gets over the western journalist stereotype when he's in countries like South Africa like everyone who looks at him will go will probably think oh a white journalist they're just here for trouble or they're just here to take pictures and go
B	mm
D	or whatever
B	uhu
D	and then someone
A	oh it's so stupid
B	what is?
A	stupid people that say that there are people that
D	yeah
A	we we had this debate in English like there are people who like fair enough if you're like a tourist
B	mm
A	and you're not donating anything but if if you are specifically a journalist you you will usually have more of an effect by by publicising pictures and making people aware
E	yeah
A	I dunno in general obviously there are exceptions and people are selfish but
C	how do you feel about like in Syria and stuff when they show people's like bodies and?
D	I
C	whenever there's a massacre they show people's bodies but like
A	right
C	in Paris
D	there's conditions to it there's conditions to it
C	don't you think it's like
A	but in Paris
D	if they are coloured their body's seen
D	if they're not
C	yeah yeah like cos like in Paris
D	you don't see their bodies anymore
C	you never or like
A	mm
C	whenever there's an attack in Europe you never see like people's bodies
B	right
C	like actual
B	the government are more likely to stop the media to
A	to cover it up and yeah
C	well
A	whereas
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	where do you where do you see the the pictures of like when you see people's bodies in in like
D	the news
C	yeah
A	right
D	the newspapers Telegraph
B	and did the news show it?
D	all these different
C	you're talking about
D	did you see that video of the erm
B	but like the Syrian government are less are less able to cover it up
A	right
B	I I agree
C	yeah I've I've heard about stuff like I don't wanna watch any of it
D	yeah
C	I don't wanna see any of it
D	there was actually a video it was
C	yeah I know
D	seven minutes long
C	yeah they just show the videos of where people are dying
B	oh yeah and some people getting shot in the face
D	there was a massive debate on Twitter or
A	I watched that Isis video I watched that
A	I watched that ten minute Isis video
C	what debate?
D	yeah
B	which one?
D	erm about the situation with the Afghanistan
B	oh yeah
D	woman who was
B	yeah
D	erm beaten to death and then one girl from black Twitter she was sticking up for the woman and she goes how can you be beaten to death over a book?
C	what was she beaten to death over?
D	erm
B	did she actually burn it?
D	no
B	oh
D	it was proven that she didn't apparently the men confessed it was a misunderstanding
C	cos you know what? in Pakistan they have a blasphemy law
D	mm
B	yeah
C	erm so like if they do something which is blasphemous you get charged and people just use it because if there's someone that they don't like
D	yeah
B	right like
C	they just like they're just like oh that person they erm they put a they put a page of the Koran in the bin and then people just go round and they just kill them
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	and they don't get anything because they're like oh we were just trying to do er to protect it people cos this blasphemy laws
D	yeah that's what people think this situation was
A	mm
D	so she was sticking up for the lady saying how erm how could you be burnt over a book? and then like some people like Muslims got really offended saying it's not just a book blah blah blah that those are the words of Allah like if you if you do that then you should expect the consequences blah blah blah but
B	mm
D	regardless
B	mm
D	like it should have been dealt with properly because in the end they found out she didn't actually do it so now she lost her life for no reason
B	yeah
D	like
A	er what?
A	oh
