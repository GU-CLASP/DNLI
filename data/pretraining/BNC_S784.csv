D	no no no
B	I need more
C	oh yeah yeah
E	yeah
D	oh
E	yeah
C	yeah
E	do you know
D	yes I've heard of him
E	apparently
D	only because of
B	really?
E	yeah
B	wow
C	cos
B	oh really?
C	do you know
E	I've heard that yes
D	yeah
C	people hate him for that because he's the ultimate viral guy
D	no
C	he makes good cat videos that's the only thing
D	he
C	I need a piss
B	er yeah I know
D	on Youtube
B	it's ridiculous the amount of viral content they have and like
D	yeah
B	like er er like he does erm talks on how they get viral content and it's interesting like but it's just the worst content so basically they appeal erm to some kind of social group that's their primary basis
D	yeah
B	so they appeal to Chinese people or they appeal to homosexuals as in gays or or trans or they appeal to Mexicans and then they say these people do this and they try and find an area where they can relate
D	yeah
B	yeah I know so
D	and that is like the one outlet that they have
B	I suppose yeah that is a good thing
E	oh it's coming to play cards
B	no can we not
D	can you just make that noise again?
B	you've got it forever it's recorded okay?
C	we're on screen splash put it back
D	I do want to play cards
B	are you serious? like I always wanna play cards but
D	no we'll continue talking
C	we can continue talking with our cards
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	it's just gonna be it's gonna be like we're talk about something really like triple threes
E	wait
B	yeah yeah yeah that's not good they don't want that
D	so
B	yes
D	do you think that
B	erm I believe in something called the gender similarity hypothesis
D	okay
B	which believes that well work it out but most of the differences
D	has there
B	so we're talking about I believe in something called the gender
D	can I can I just ask my
B	yeah yeah
D	like I I was just I just asked
C	everyone yeah
D	yeah just all of you all the audience
E	all of our listeners
D	but like erm
B	like behaviour
D	not like genetic
B	like natural natural behaviour
C	erm
D	socially constructed
C	socially
B	yeah that's that's that's similar to what I believe definitely there's the
D	sorry what's it called?
B	er gender similarities hypothesis so just
E	why Jupiter?
C	I don't know
E	Pluto he's like from Pluto
B	yeah he's from Pluto
C	he he's from the comet
E	and he got really pissed off that they're a dwarf planet now but
D	oh no
B	and yeah culture is obviously has a huge impact on it
D	yeah
B	and but that's not to say that culture isn't real the fact that culture has an impact on people erm
D	yeah it's like it's like
B	makes it real exactly
E	what were you gonna say about it?
C	yeah I know I I don't yeah but that
B	yeah
C	cos if you have a small group of people right say at the start of humanity there were like hundreds of people
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	if if one person
B	yeah
C	no one will argue against it ever because it's been there for so long
B	yeah
D	I know I know I I I mean as in like it's it's a reality to be accepted not as in it's actually true so
B	yeah oh no
D	yeah
B	so erm you you you think about why people are so scared of planes
C	right
B	erm you only ever hear about planes that
D	crash
E	that crash
B	whereas
C	but I mean the fact of the matter is that you're more likely to die in a car crash
B	exactly and and people don't get that
E	is it like similar to the terrorist attacks you're more likely to die from
D	like getting hit on
B	yeah or it's like sharks or there's so many ridiculous things erm
C	it's that's kind of the reason why I'm not scared of ISIS
B	yeah
C	because
D	but also there's
E	yeah
D	yeah I'm not scared
B	what is that?
E	you haven't seen it?
E	she was so angry she just put up a post saying I will destroy ISIS
D	yeah
C	no way
D	since that day a fake
C	it's on the nine
D	why is that?
B	what are you doing?
C	wait I put a nine there though
D	so what are you doing?
C	I put a nine down
D	oh
C	where did the Jack come from? is that mine or it that yours?
E	that's yours that's yours
B	I didn't have a second Jack
C	wait did you put one maybe maybe I put no maybe
C	okay
E	but yeah erm
C	okay let me take this back
E	but yeah erm
C	did I or you put the nine down?
B	in terms of physical differences erm
E	yeah and we have different sensitivities to them
B	exactly and we there've been tests erm
C	done
B	after
D	mm
B	erm and men and women basically have the same responses in terms of the hormones that gets released in terms of attachment to the child
D	mm
B	yet almost everyone would assume that women are instinctively more drawn to looking after a child but
D	yeah
B	there's I mean
D	yeah
B	erm
D	yeah
B	and I'm
B	and we just have completely conflicting
D	why?
B	cos she believes that
D	yeah
B	and she was arguing that erm
B	erm
C	right
B	for a couple of reasons well for many different reasons erm
unknown_female	ho ho
B	it's really hard
C	okay that is so
B	I'm so struggling
C	we shouldn't play cards while we're doing this
B	okay erm
E	we're still going to play it
D	you guys just need to get used to it
E	yeah yeah erm
B	okay erm so
E	if you think about making podcasts for a living
C	no it's double
E	we need to we need to like
B	er yeah okay erm
E	we're gonna play cards
B	erm
C	go back go back to the start cos I I didn't get any of that
E	just bringing up a twitter message okay erm
C	well we don't want to see your your DM please
E	no no no honestly apparently they'd just had
B	a scientific debate
E	that's all they talk about
D	okay
B	yeah er
C	why?
B	because
C	no I I think that's fair
B	I I I don't think it
B	they're they they can just easily be broken and it's not she was arguing that it's
C	yeah I think so
B	or wrong it it it is painful but it's bad for the person in the long run
C	well I mean erm
B	erm to
C	well when when you say when you say wrong you mean like wrong morally or?
B	no no no not morally
D	socially
C	okay
B	in a harmful way
C	we were
B	mm
C	who
B	yeah exactly exactly
C	yeah
B	that's what society perpetuates whereas if you look at the
C	yeah
B	or sexual pair bonds
C	yeah
B	either multiple throughout their life or multiple at the same time
C	right but
B	so generally in in erm if you study it
C	yeah
B	then you have social pair bonds
E	yeah
B	and you have er sexual pair bonds
E	yeah
B	which some they can be the same you you can be both social and sexual with someone
B	but it is perfectly it is perfectly healthy for me to no no longer be friends with
D	it's gotta be
C	well no no no no no no let's not go there because
B	okay
E	no no he's he's he's
D	no
B	okay yeah
C	just sexual
D	yeah
B	it would be healthy for me to have a sexual relationship with someone and then break up with them
C	yeah
C	again if you had like two people on Mars that would be fine right? but we don't that's not like the perfect world we live in
B	right so you're arguing
C	because there is society and we live in that world
B	you think it does perpetuate
C	yeah
B	but society is changing and and the the the attitude like fifty percent of people get divorced now it's more ridiculous that we try and perpetuate this idea
D	of monogamy?
B	yeah when when in reality
D	you don't believe in actual monogamy?
C	yeah I I think I agree with that
B	no no
C	yeah I know but I think again commitment is a a a social
B	uhu
C	I mean I mean yeah I I I would say if you're gonna be erm mostly bonded to anyone it's gonna be your children because you wanna rear them er just on a biological level it's
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	rather than a sexual partner
D	but if you look at there there
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	there's also like erm
B	mm hm
C	pan chimp er pan troglodytes
D	they have like sex with just like loads of
C	yeah
D	and and gorillas have harems
D	but humans like cos cos at a hunter gatherer stage it made more sense to have like
C	yeah
D	so we are also partially at least
C	yeah
B	mm hm
D	but
C	yes
D	most people
C	isn't that what
D	ah ah ah
C	but I think the problem with trying to look at it biologically compared to primates is that
D	that's true
C	when when we became
E	mm
C	so
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	it was to like
D	yeah
B	but but the ideas of clinginess are
C	no I'm just saying that people ran out of things people ran out of things to do like two hundred years ago
B	right
E	so like
B	yeah
E	what what do they
B	in Africa?
D	do you mean people in poverty?
B	do you mean like tribe?
E	in poverty
B	oh okay
D	anyone in poverty
C	I I I think it's
C	different again because
B	mm hm
C	the entire world as it is cos they're so connected it's not I mean you you look at from a like tribally
D	really?
C	yeah
B	erm
D	I don't know
C	because we we have stuff like TV now right?
B	no but like what do you mean by like tribe people be more polygamous
C	like like so so er no no I I mean
B	yeah
E	yeah yeah yeah
D	okay yeah
E	which no one has ever been to like
C	yeah
D	yeah the Andaman Islands
B	right yeah
C	and so so no one has ever been there no one has even
B	yeah
C	they don't have an understanding of the the culture and society we built up
B	yeah
C	right so
D	yeah
C	that we've used to like make our lives so amazingly comfortable after over the last like three hundred years right?
D	uhu
C	so they're still in that kind of
D	yeah
C	so
D	yeah
C	where our aim no one goes
D	yeah
C	yeah what's what's your job?
D	right
E	Bear Gryllis?
C	Bear Gryllis
E	I'm a Celebrity?
C	yeah so so
D	yeah
B	I disagree with that
D	it happened but I do I I think
C	I'm just saying that's like the reason that we can't really
D	I think the
C	yeah
E	yeah
D	who are much more simple
E	have you seen Rise of the Planet of the Apes?
C	Caesar
E	yeah
B	there are ways to look at primate anthropology in the right way and there are ways to do it the wrong way and most people do it the wrong way in that
D	mm
B	but that doesn't always include the idea of nurture or the idea of our society the kind of effects that they have
C	yeah yeah
B	how about
C	yeah
B	whereas this one tribe in Tibet or former Tibet that was
C	mm
B	so why do you think it was
D	well because women can like
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah right
D	it's just easier
C	but isn't that just part of
E	isn't it just part of their culture?
B	yeah
D	it could be yeah the father is
C	isn't it just part of their culture though?
B	yeah that's the thing
E	something they've built up from
B	mm
D	no but they they can and like Western and
C	mm hm
D	there's a lot of myths around it
C	I think it's just
E	yeah
B	whereas a man can basically produce sperm on point
D	for his whole life
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yes
B	yeah
C	well no I I'm also sure
B	mm hm
C	I'm pretty sure there would be some
B	right
C	I I think just because the tribes are then kind of branched off like that
B	right
C	obviously a man's gonna have sex with more women and a woman is gonna have sex with more different men
D	when you say cave man what do you mean by cave man?
E	just means erm
C	yeah
E	erm
C	like the most basic
D	does that mean like?
B	we're likely
C	communication
D	erm I saw a National Geographic
B	yeah
D	no erm
C	in South Africa
D	nipo nipo
E	homonipo
B	no no no genuinely it begins with an N
C	well he is basically a primate
B	yeah
E	should we should we explain who
B	no no no
D	never
E	micro penis
C	micro penis
C	we can bleep these out later
E	yeah
B	but the thing they took from that was that it was basically deep into a cave into like really tiny cracks
D	yeah it was an all-female team who did it as well
B	yeah and and basically they concluded that this was some kind of
E	cos they're too
D	yeah yeah yeah that's why they had an all-female team
B	they should have just got children in there
C	yeah they should have children
B	no the children might die
E	it's not just
B	oh yeah
C	it's
D	it's for science if they write it down it's okay
C	it was really weird they concluded that either it was some kind of
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	so that was like the first instinct
C	or
D	no no
E	that's another thing
D	it was impossible it was so intricate that it had to have been someone
E	yeah
C	yeah
D	oh I see
E	but but it it they they thought it
D	no
E	no
C	yeah
E	yeah I know no but that's that's humans that's not scientists
C	yeah no but I'm saying
D	that's the public
C	er if if you're a scientist
B	I don't know no they were they were very initial initial findings it's gonna be like plenty more
C	it's like if you see that you go oh my god it's funeral rites look how developed we were
E	yeah no
D	mm hm
E	were developed enough to consider things like death and like erm recognise it and like
C	yeah
E	and like actually bury it cos that's too advanced for them
C	yeah mm hm
E	but that's why it's so
C	are they sure they didn't go oh
C	he he's starting to stink a lot
B	no there were there were multiple bodies
C	oh right oh right yeah
D	yeah but even so they were so
B	oh yeah
C	er er er
B	what what did you say?
C	toss in toss in toss in crack
B	oh toss him
C	toss him in crack
B	yeah
C	I I feel like
B	yeah
C	and now
E	male domination meaning?
C	like where where
D	ah
B	so when you say evolution do you think that's just cultural evolution or do you think?
C	I I think this is cultural societal
B	do you think there's anything biological behind it?
C	no I don't think there's anything biological about it
D	oh the man hating?
C	yeah
B	you just mean really angry feminists?
C	yeah basically
B	right
C	where where feminism should have been about equality it's now about that everything a man does is wrong because
B	just steps over yeah right
D	I don't I I don't I don't
B	it's a bit strange
C	yeah but there is there is a a strong proportion or at least the loud ones
B	a strong
D	no but the thing is that people say the same thing
B	but there's not
D	about Islam they say the same thing about that
B	yeah
D	they're like oh those are the those are the loud ones those are the people do things that hear about that's the reason you hear about them
B	they only get reported
D	you hear about them
B	yeah
C	can we use
B	yes
C	can we call him like er
D	we can't use names of people we're talking shit about
C	yeah
B	they're not gonna hear this
E	okay how many
C	there must be a lot
E	yeah
D	I mean I went to his birthday remember?
C	but
D	oh no ah
C	yeah yeah
E	is this
D	yeah it's
B	right
D	and then erm
C	we should make a podcast about
B	right and so then the university got involved after a complaint had been put in
C	oh my god so annoying
B	and she was banned from doing it
E	yeah?
B	from
C	wasn't it also cos like disabled people were angry that they they couldn't do yoga or something? they also made that point as well
B	it was from
D	yeah
E	white oppression
E	white white
D	white oppression?
E	white supremacy
B	white supremacy even that that we've been stealing these cultures for so long it was it was ridiculous it was
D	I I
B	right
D	and the thing is like some people don't like it because a lot cos when people when when like a lot of people were younger
C	yeah
D	they were like mocked or even now even nowadays they're mocked or like stuff for wearing bindis by other people and now they think as soon as they as soon as it becomes something beneficial for them like
E	right
D	they can use it as a fashion accessory they think it's okay they no no longer do it and they reduce it of it's any any religious value cos some things like that are religious and like yoga was originally a
C	yeah
E	have you been to like
B	I've been to one music concert
E	white people like girls and boys just wearing really Indian stuff that they have no idea the meaning of
D	yeah
B	right
E	and that just takes away all value
D	yeah it yeah exactly
E	like
B	right
E	what my culture is
D	exactly
E	uhu
D	because the thing is
B	right yeah
D	that the only thing it has in common is the name
C	mm hm
D	and it's like it's like
C	but isn't it then its own thing so it doesn't matter?
D	no
C	mm
D	cos even though it's a cultural thing for that part of the world
C	mm hm
D	people
B	right do do most of these
D	no it's
E	they they think it's they think it looks cool and it does look cool
B	yeah
D	the thing is
B	okay
D	it's like it's like if I got a picture of like
D	and I started doing that or if I like
D	or if like erm got like a sample from the Quran and I put it in my song called weed weed weed or something
B	right
D	like it's it's so divorcing from actual context that it becomes disrespectful that's why people don't like it but I also understand like people think that's a bit weird
C	yeah
D	because
C	I think I like that kind of
C	yeah
D	yeah
D	but they're
C	yeah I know but that's that's like everything though in life you know
B	what?
E	it's an analogy
B	I don't like his analogies in general but this is particularly bad
C	wait if you if you if you
B	can you explain your point and not use an analogy?
C	no I can't do that
B	okay alright
C	right so you have a plate of food right with like chicken and vegetables on it
D	what?
B	and and how does that relate?
C	because you're like saying you you take the best stuff from it and and you leave the the stuff you don't like
D	yeah
C	yeah but that's like anything in life
D	and you're taking the stuff which you like
C	that's stuff like everyone in life
B	what do you
D	I don't know actually
B	I said that like completely natural do you do you er do you do you do you er do you?
D	do you? do you
B	yeah yeah
D	I'm I'm I'm
B	right
D	so I don't know
B	do you think it's up to the dignity of the cultures that are being
D	I
B	you should do that or should not do that?
D	you should only have those people
B	oh okay
D	cos if you have like it's like it's like when they have like discussions about Islam and they invite no Muslim speakers
D	that's dumb
C	also it's important to have a range of speakers cos you're always on that show when they do invite a Muslim they find they find the most hard line
D	yeah well
C	like right wing Muslim
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	Anjun Chowdrey
B	yeah Anjun
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's always let's get the the most racist person we can find and then stick them on the show
B	yeah
C	oh yeah did they all just walk out?
E	they all just like
B	yeah
E	they they all
B	then they were like
C	fucking hate Katie Hopkins
D	yeah
B	it's such a student thing to do but I like it's a dick thing to do but
C	I like that they did it though
B	I don't I was like so happy with the the whole
E	yeah
D	after after Martin Luther King that's my top protest of all time
C	Martin Luther King
D	I mean they made no sense but
B	oh it was oh it was
C	why do people still listen to Hopkins?
E	they don't cos they stood up and left though
C	yeah
B	why do people read the Sun? why do people read the Daily she's a columnist for the Daily fucking Mail how can someone like that be a columnist?
E	yeah but everyone knows the Daily Mail's shit
B	I know but people read it and the Sun has the second er er yeah the second wide er biggest readership in the UK
D	that's cos white people are racist
E	that's cos
B	they've stopped page three now
C	they've stopped page three
B	no no why
E	so why do people still read it?
D	white people are racist
B	all white people ever
E	yeah
D	what's wrong with saying white people are racist?
B	what is it serious or not serious?
D	yeah
E	well because white people
B	cos there's sixty million people and like forty million people of them are white
B	yeah
D	I don't mean
C	yeah actually yeah no that's a fair point because you're less likely to be racist if people have said racist things to you right?
B	yeah
C	no one's ever said racist things to a white person
D	yeah
C	or it's very unlikely
E	yeah that's true
B	have you heard of reverse racism? I know it might be a ball of shit thing
E	because because of white supremacy
D	no
B	okay okay but
C	not the ridiculous ones that are like
D	okay reverse racism is basically
C	you're gonna use the worst example
D	you can be racist
C	oh okay
D	yeah
D	or if I
C	no no
C	okay
E	can we can call that one of our segments?
D	yeah
C	but you're but you're exonerating these people just because they're in a position of power
D	no you didn't no you didn't let me finish explaining
B	okay go on yeah
C	yeah
B	you're right
D	no matter who they are they benefit from the system
B	no that's generalising it
D	no no no no no no let me let me finish let me finish speaking
C	yeah cracker
C	yeah
D	for example
B	yeah
D	even if you have even if you don't if your family has never owned for example slaves or something
B	yeah
D	all white people have benefited from the slave trade due to the economic advantages gained by the British Empire by the
C	okay
D	I can't I can't argue very well on the spot but erm
C	no I hear you
D	but white people as a whole has benefited from structures like that
C	that's like
D	I'm so
D	but but also there's
B	go on go on think about it
D	erm
B	I'll I'll start
D	but erm
E	wait can I make a point?
B	yeah go on
E	when I went to India have you been to India?
D	right
B	yeah
E	all the advertisements on the TV are white people
C	it's like that poem we read
B	mm hm
C	do you remember the one for
E	electricity
D	no just no oh erm
C	no
D	yeah
B	oh er a lone er
C	don't worry Cambridge will help
B	yeah
C	lucky yeah sorry why? sorry go again though
B	but I think
D	no but all all people all all
C	I see your point
D	because cos they are I don't know I
B	I disagree so
D	why?
B	racism is wrong because it's racist
D	the thing is so many people don't say that they're racist and then power is
B	yeah I I totally agree racism
D	yeah
B	but to just completely dismiss it because
D	no but I'm not dismissing anyone
B	no but you're saying
D	no
B	from from the racism erm system
D	I guess yeah fine
B	and you can't put that on all white people
C	yeah no no er he's not saying that they benefited because they they they outwardly did it and wanted to benefit
D	yeah
C	they're just saying it it was
D	yeah
E	right
B	that doesn't that doesn't mean that any that racism can't happen to these white people though yes there are generations that have benefitted but
C	yes but but but
B	again these are all examples there are going to be examples that are on the other way as well
D	not really
E	well there aren't
D	can you give me can you give me a genuine example of reverse racism?
B	obviously I can't just quote something that's actually happened
D	yeah I know
B	but there must be white people that have been discriminated against
C	but that's a that's a
B	no no no okay but the point is that you can't dismiss it because in general
D	no but the thing is like how would a white person be discriminated against what is that situation?
B	okay
D	I can't even imagine a situation where a white person is discriminated against for being white
B	so think of okay
B	not thousands
B	hundreds of years to black people and that's totally wrong but of course it can happen to the white person and like
D	but that's not that's not racism that's bullying
B	no no yeah that's still racism though you can call someone racist
D	no it isn't
B	you can be racist you can hate that person because they're not black or they're not Indian or they're not
D	you you can you
E	okay so
D	but that's bullying but I don't think that's racism
B	so you only see racism in the culture in in the context of our
E	no but what's the like ratio between a white person being bullied for being white and a coloured person being bullied for being coloured?
B	but it's not yeah I'm saying I I'm saying the vast majority
C	you can't say coloured any more
B	I'm saying the vast majority happens to obviously happens to to
D	yeah person of colour
C	obviously we need this to go out we don't want to get taken down for any race reasons
B	no but
E	Cambridge can you tell us which one's right?
B	no
C	we're not racist
B	erm
D	yeah ah
B	racism in the form that you're saying
E	in theory yes
B	but but discrimination
C	discrimination against anyone
B	and I think you can call that
C	yeah
B	there have they have to be circumstances
C	there are there are a small amount a small amount of circumstances where it does happen we're just saying the vast vast majority of the time a white the white culture is idolised
B	everyone? there are seven billion people you can use something like the whole of the world
C	yeah
E	no no no
D	the thing is the thing is you're saying that we can never make a generalisation so then why do we have doctors? cos they can't cos doctors make generalisations all the time to treat their patients like we might as well
B	that's a completely different issue you're put you're saying
D	no no but the thing is you're a concept you're using is that don't make generalisations
C	yeah
D	we're not buying it
B	okay I won't use the point you shouldn't use generalisations but I'll make the point you're saying whole of white people to represent billions of people and that's all how about hundreds of millions of people and that's you can't do that
D	no but the thing is when I say white people it's short hand for people who are
B	no but you're saying
D	without admitting to be racist
C	wait
B	but you're saying the whole of white people cannot cannot but
D	the whole of white people
B	yeah that's
C	or one of them
B	basically what you're saying
B	cannot be subjected to this kind of racism because
C	we're not
D	but like no
B	it's not a probability thing?
D	like how would a white person
C	just because
D	yeah
C	there's no there's no reason
D	have you ever heard of like someone being denied a job because they were white?
B	okay but
E	okay no no no but the way it works is
B	mm hm
E	are immigrants
D	it's it's not only that it's cos of erm colonialism
C	yeah I mean if you look at if you look at the parts of the world that are the most developed they are the places with the greater proportion of caucasians
D	like you know your know your erm situation of the white person being bullied
B	okay can you say
D	that would happen if white people moved to say Africa or Asia or Asia that doesn't happen
B	and there are okay no no
D	that wouldn't
C	does a guy just get bullied in Sierra Leone?
B	okay okay
B	no matter what I say even if I use examples the reason that your point over supersedes whatever I say is because you're saying that it's such a small proportion
C	yeah
B	but of course it
D	yeah yeah
B	where it's been populated by working class erm people who are black
D	yeah
B	and there are then still white people there
D	yeah
B	and they
D	but the thing is they call
B	can I finish?
D	yeah sorry
B	so so at some point these white people have been discriminated against and
D	no no
B	okay
D	can you
B	okay okay
D	can you ever compare those two situations?
C	okay let's I
B	I'm just about to
D	can you can you ever compare those
B	yes yes you can and I'm I'm about it
D	okay how?
B	okay so let's say someone again you're not gonna believe me
C	to call someone a cracker doesn't have the same connotation though
B	listen to me come on please
D	no no
B	someone is being so abused because he and he's so socially excluded
D	okay that's bullying that's not that's not racism
B	now that is
C	possible
B	yes that why isn't that racism?
D	no no no no no but you're talking about cracker you didn't mention the word cracker in that argument at all
B	no stop saying cracker that's such a trivial statement let's
E	what does that even mean?
D	no but no
B	stop thinking up
B	cracker before okay
D	erm black people in America say cracker it's like
B	if
D	yeah right so we're
B	okay now how is it that person's
C	that is racist
D	yeah okay so
B	okay so but why is it not racist?
D	no no I know I know as in you said you were gonna compare cracker and the N word you didn't do that
B	I didn't no no I didn't compare I said no I I I I didn't say I was gonna compare cracker and the N word I think you are exaggerating that and you're looking at racism and thinking
D	no but the thing is
B	give me one sec you're looking at racism and saying okay if you look at it from a profanity point of view
B	no it's funny
C	stop saying cracker
D	I haven't said cracker what it's you two
C	you said it like thirty seconds ago
D	continue continue continue
B	I'm saying it cos of you guys I didn't want to bring that up
D	okay
B	and discrimination against someone because of their colour is causing people to commit suicide
D	okay
B	therefore how is it that person's fault? why is it not a serious problem? because no he hasn't committed suicide because he's been called the C word he's been he's been he's committed suicide
D	what?
B	if I say cracker you're going to give me shit for it
E	the C word
B	racism isn't just words it's
C	yeah yeah we know that
D	no no that's the thing it's not just words it's also historical context that's why
B	can we get away from the cracker thing?
D	no but that's the that's the thing cos
B	yeah
D	that's how those
B	I know and I didn't want to compare them it was you guys that brought up that word
D	no I
B	I'm trying to compare
D	okay I I
E	we get that we get that
D	I guess I guess
B	yes the vast majority happens to blacks but it can be against whites
D	no no no no no stop stop you're anticipating what I'm going to say and it's wrong
D	but
B	right
D	because it's true I have a beard I'm brown he must be dodgy that's why
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	and things like whenever we whenever there's a situation where bags need to be checked
B	them people white people committed suicide
D	no no no no no no listen to what I'm saying
B	yes
D	that's why you cannot compare that's why you cannot compare because in the state of the United Kingdom today the the state your your you only see racism as an instance racism is not an instance it's a historical system
B	mm hm
D	which is currently perpetuating negative stereotypes on people and enforcing behaviour which for for example like
B	mm hm
D	and the white
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
D	with the Hispanic name
C	yeah loads of people change their names
D	exactly my my uncle's changed his name
B	you yes you can use as many examples as you want
D	no but no no
B	no I agree with you
D	but the thing is you you you
B	okay how about from a
D	cos like
B	legal standpoint okay erm
D	no no but that that's what we disagree on you you you you you seem to be thinking
B	and so much history and
D	no you seem to think that racism is an instance like something happened that's racist that's not necessarily true
B	the reason I'm arguing that
D	racism happens because there's a system behind it like
B	yeah yeah yeah I get it I get it yeah
D	that's not racist that's they have a reason
B	yeah
D	but if they see me and they have the automatic assumption because of culture which has perpetuated the idea that people like me
B	yeah
D	steal things in shops that's racist
B	I get what you mean
D	but the thing is that that that that perpetuation does not exist for white people on the same level
B	right
D	there's no
B	I agree it's not on the same level
D	yeah
B	surely you must agree that you could incite racial hatred against whites?
D	okay yes fine fine
C	sure but no one's ever been charged for that
D	fine but that has nothing to do with what we were that has nothing to do with
B	I'm sure there have been
B	it that was the point that I was making because the the way I saw what you were arguing was
D	no no it's
C	no no
D	it's not
E	and it can happen
D	but the thing is I
B	okay
D	there is there is no equivalent for white people of that kind of
B	okay
D	for white people
B	so if you look at sexism
D	you're conflating
B	conflating
D	I don't think you can compare them you you can't
B	but
D	minorities and blacks as if black people are not a minority
B	yeah yeah
D	they're special
C	let's hope she never hears this podcast
B	that that sexism has always happened to females and that's the reason we're in this society it's perpetuated and females are paid less and de de de therefore sexism against males is not part of that systematic system of sexism?
D	yeah
C	yeah
E	I think that's right I
B	so would you guys not argue that sexism can happen to men?
D	okay what give me an example of
C	I think I think the exact same thing we said
B	yeah I think you're arguing different points
D	I I think I what I think what he means by little as in
C	what he's saying is
D	it's not backed up by any historical basis it's not backed up in culture it's not backed up systematically
B	right
C	yeah those are the reasons those are the reasons why it is so little
D	yeah
B	but neither was
D	but like like you can't compare the two instances like erm
B	right
D	those are two different
B	they are different but I think they're they both can be they both can be legitimate
B	and are serious offenses that we need to deal with
D	no but can you can you give me an example of a
B	sexist against men erm
E	women abusing men on the street and no one cares
B	no cos that you're going to say that's like the incidence thing like I was saying about
E	oh okay
D	no that that that's
B	so er er
D	no but but the the thing is but the thing is that with that example
B	I've got a better example
D	that's not that's not
B	you'd say that happens so much less than
D	no no no no
C	that's not as a result of the system
D	the the reason that people don't take that seriously
B	right
D	is because
B	why can't it be sexism though?
D	because it isn't because it isn't because
C	well it is sexism
D	no but it how is it sexism?
C	well
B	because
C	discrimination because of their sex
B	and because they're male they're not taken as seriously
C	yeah
D	yeah no no they're not
B	right
C	cultural societal reasons
D	yeah because men have been stated as superior so
C	but it's still it is sexism
D	it is
B	right
C	yeah but it's not a moral standpoint it's sexist because discrimination is
D	yeah no no no I'm saying yeah it's sexism but it's not the same type of sexism as
C	people
D	no it it it it it stems from the same force as the sexism that women face
C	right
B	but then don't you think just because females
D	no
B	I really don't get this cos cos okay so so you're saying there's this system okay and yes it's sort of the vast majority benefits men but part of that system that we've now realised is because men are in these positions of power they feel an inclination to not fail as much and therefore because of that pressure more men commit suicide than women
D	yes
B	so
C	okay
B	erm
D	like men aren't allowed to talk about emotions and stuff like that
B	right yeah I guess yeah yeah
D	so if he if he talks about his emotions he's considered like weak
B	yeah if someone tells him
D	you see
C	exactly
D	it is it is sexism but it's not the same thing as like cos we're comparing it to like white people experiencing racism it's not the same thing
B	no I know I
D	it's not the same it's not the same thing as like
C	uhu
D	what's happening what would happen in that situation is that a man's gender role isn't being followed he's not being strong or he's not being like stoic or whatever
C	right
D	his gender roles aren't being followed but the thing is that's not that's not anything to do with women at all that's not anything to do with
C	mm I do I do agree with
D	but like that's why I don't believe in like men's right's activists
C	but then
E	yeah
D	I don't
C	stuff like stuff like it's okay to cry or it's okay to have mental mental health issues as a male
D	no no but that no but that's what
C	yeah I know
D	that oppose that behaviour
E	I don't I don't think their should be like an activist group for men to be able to cry
D	that's like saying it's like saying
E	cos crying is just something you do as a human
D	yeah
C	okay you're saying that like it's common sense but it's not because so many people commit suicide
D	yeah and that's why there's
E	I think that's
C	then it should be gender equality
D	no but that no but how much of a pedantic
C	just go men men's rights people as in
D	no because why why would you it doesn't make sense it's like it's like when you
C	it makes perfect sense
D	no no it doesn't because it's like we instead of like homophobia we don't go into very specific detail about whatever we don't say like bi-phobia or pan-phobia or like straight whatever or like erm effeminate phobia you just say homophobia as a broad term the same thing with feminism feminism is a broad term that has a historical context
C	yeah but
B	yeah
E	that's just cos what we hear
D	no no the
C	but whose fault it that?
D	that isn't anyone's fault
C	exactly solve it then
E	you you you seem to think that
D	but
C	okay but you were saying
E	but you understand the effect it would have
C	but you were changing it it's a rebrand
D	perhaps but you you were
B	stupid to have men's sex activist groups?
D	men's rights
B	men's rights activist groups
D	yeah yeah
B	surely yes female feminism
D	but I'm not saying that I never said that
B	but no but you literally you you said it a few
D	yes because that's cos like
B	that's just because people don't understand feminism
D	I no because no no
B	right
D	the things that they the legitimate things they say they're saying are all covered in feminism
B	but I don't think I think you saying that you shouldn't have men's rights groups and it should only be feminism further would perpetuate the idea that men that it's not about men it's all about women
D	no it wouldn't because why why would it? just because of the name?
C	the problem is
B	I don't I don't think that it would
D	you're not gonna end this by flattery
B	no
C	no no you are so you look at this and you go well there's no need for men's rights groups it's so simple look at the feminists
B	exactly
D	yes but why should we accommodate ourselves for idiots? like
B	because that's the majority of society
C	because the
D	but
C	who understands shit like this
B	and it and it exactly
D	no
B	and we need to effect the the the mass crowd not just the people like us who can comprehend or look into this
C	it's the
D	no but the things is then why are you dividing camps of already established people into smaller groups? you don't need to do that
B	because most people only attach importance to erm female rights which I get
D	but the thing is that's what's been happening and in feminism
B	right
D	the same things are being tackled cos they're tackled under the idea of gender
B	yeah
D	and
C	yeah but then
B	well it's harder for feminism feminism affects society far more than
D	wait wait
C	it's harder to be a man in a feminist group than a woman in a feminist group
D	well well
C	wait wait wait if what you're saying is it should be just cos they're tackling the same problem in general they should be equal you should have an equal proportion of men and women in a feminist group but that's the the thing is it doesn't happen like that it doesn't work like that
D	no well well the thing is feminism started as a group which opposed gender roles and it only contained women
C	so no right so if it was
D	because the same ideas are held within feminism
C	yeah same ideas so then
D	yeah you
C	but then what why I know but
D	it's because men don't take it seriously cos they benefit from the system of perpetuation of of the patriarchy
C	but you just said they didn't because because men's rights groups don't need us to fight the same thing
D	no but the thing is sometimes they don't sometimes they do for example men benefit in the way that
E	or paid more
E	or paid more
D	yeah yeah yeah
E	it benefits men
D	yeah
E	so they don't oppose to it
D	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	it's a shit argument it's a shitty argument but
D	yeah
E	and this this before he slaughters you
B	okay no
D	learn
B	have better access to her children
C	no but what she's done there is what what she's done there is
B	yeah
C	and so she's taken that
B	she's taken the positives
D	but the thing is she she her her inspiration is also from Islam
C	it doesn't work like that
B	yeah
D	and the thing is that like
C	right
D	and that negatively affects both men and women women started the movement a long time ago women are including men
C	right
D	that's why
B	yeah
E	do you think that's why
D	yeah
E	he he was like saying how he was like so masculine er he doesn't think
D	yeah no that's the thing in in some that's a whole other thing about gay people gay gay men
C	wow that's you know
D	no no no no no no you're saying
B	you're saying all gay men don't like effeminate people and are racist
D	no no no I'm no I'm not saying all
B	right
D	but for example if you were
C	yeah
D	okay it's a it's a gay thing it's like a gay app
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	people people yeah basically
E	everyone knows what Grindr is
D	like basically like ninety-five percent of people will say no blacks no Asians whatever
E	but are you
D	no I'm not but the but historically gay people have been very
D	I
C	what's the what's the point that you're making about it though?
D	cos he mentioned like how
C	oh right oh right right
D	and that's really bad they don't like people there there there's too much
C	mm hm
D	and that and they also quite a lot of gay people
C	why in particular?
D	I don't know
D	also because they're white
C	really?
D	most out gay people are white cos the majority of this country is white and also you're less likely to be an ethnic minority and have another sexuality other than straight
E	yeah yeah
C	right what because?
D	erm because
C	you can't be gay otherwise you'll get murdered
D	yeah
B	pretty much
E	you can't be openly gay
D	cos it's more taboo in other countries
B	right right
D	and I bet you
C	has it been more taboo and now we're accepting it more?
B	we're accepting it
D	no no no we're accepting it
C	doesn't mean the rest of the world's accepting it
E	like when you say we're
B	people on Grindr aren't
D	that that was just one example
B	hidden away gays in Africa or something
D	that that was just one example but like
C	but there there are plenty of places in Africa where gay
D	yeah
E	you you get jailed there
C	you get jail time
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	you get jail time there for being gay
D	no but that that that's not also there's not just that it's also stuff like in in in countries that
C	French
D	the French
E	Spanish
D	whoever Spanish
C	Italians
D	and
D	they
D	I said Germans
C	Americans Americans
D	they persecuted people who weren't straight because they had the they had biblical Christianity on their minds and they were like being gay is wrong
C	yeah
D	that's also so you it's a bit of a generalisation to say back in their home countries because it used to be accepted and now it's accepted but still on a really
D	er overall it's still very taboo
C	yeah
D	like in India the the white people introduced the law that it's illegal to have erm
D	yeah
C	why just?
D	but they but they er that penal code was only established because because white people
C	reinstated it
D	thought saw it and they they thought it was against their version of Christianity
C	yeah
B	I'm interested by what you're saying about
D	like
B	right
D	cos there's such a
B	right?
D	there's a huge and in Pakistan is one of the
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
D	but like people don't think of that because you know they think oh it's
B	right
D	woah
E	okay great
D	can we can you change the group chat name to like
B	where what's our what's our podcast name?

D	no
E	yeah I know she's like a a
C	or like she's like
E	exactly
D	no that no that's the thing I think
B	yeah
D	yeah she's she's definitely opinionated on this

C	this is why we can't release this podcast
E	yeah
D	this isn't offensive though
E	no no just say it it's a different podcast episode two
C	right
B	you made you made some joke about nine eleven at the start it was like I I thought this might be really offensive
D	who?
C	no no that was
D	no it was you
E	no cos
D	yeah no I I I I talked about it
C	it was about the tall guy
D	I probably brought it up
C	you said he could have said he could have said
D	I I I I just know that so many Americans feel really offended
B	do you do you think that's right that people feel so offended by it?
D	no
B	I know right? but
D	and the thing is I think that's
C	the world has thousands of people dying and
E	and Syria like
D	and and and the fact that this one occasion is being be
C	yeah how about Paris attacks?
D	yeah the Paris
C	two hundred people died and half of Facebook's users turned their profile picture to the French flag
D	and the
C	I know
B	Nigeria
D	yeah Nigeria
C	ISIS plough through villages and killed absolutely everyone
D	exactly
C	in in in like hours they kill thousands of people at no point was everyone going oh my god pray for
D	yeah
E	pray for like
D	and and and even like for example when there was a tension like in Pakistan the the
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	they reported it in such a bad way they said oh those militants came in they killed people because they didn't want people to get an education which is
C	right
D	they whenever they do it they never give any story any emotional any not even emotional any factual depth it always has to fit in the idea of Islam
C	oh my god when the when the Christian Syrians were killed
D	exactly
C	it was like oh my god there was there was like oh like there was a few thousand Christian Syrians
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah
C	and there were millions and millions of like Muslim Syrians being like or thousands and thousands of Muslim Syrians being killed every single day
D	yeah
C	but there was like a thousand well less than a thousand Christian Syrians
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	who were who were like erm running away somewhere and the amount of coverage that was got was unbelievable
D	yeah exactly
B	it was ten ten percent of Racca was Christian and now it's zero percent cos they've all there's been a huge exodus and
D	like
C	they're not important of course they are
B	yeah of course
D	we're we're just saying that like because of the fact that they don't get much coverage it's just we're not treated they're not treated seriously
E	my
B	sure
E	yeah yeah yeah
B	erm
E	let's finish this up
