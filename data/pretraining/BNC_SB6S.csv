B	mm
A	er
B	mm
A	so
B	uhu
A	to pay via the website
B	uhu
A	and I feel a bit uncomfortable with that cos the website is full of these adverts saying
B	yeah
A	if you book through the website you get this protection and that protection blah blah blah so I'm not so happy about just sending money to a random bank account
B	uhu
A	she could've been hacked or whatever
B	and you have to pay for international transfer
A	exactly this is very true erm so I said this to
B	oh no
A	or is running out and curious thing in Northern Ireland you can have either erm and post offices in Northern Ireland will give you a form for down south Ireland
B	mm
A	and down south Ireland will give you a form for up north Ireland or UK erm
A	erm but
B	uhu okay
A	so yeah but it makes sense I suppose that as a
B	that's so funny
A	public service
B	uhu
A	he's probably got all sorts of forms together with his
B	yeah
A	tomato ketchup vinegar
B	running a solicitors back through the back
A	yeah
B	ah
A	I just thought that was typical that's so funny but anyway we both like the look of another place as well which is a little bit out of town but it's got this erm it's right on the sea and got this really cosy
B	nice
A	outdoor like nook bit where you can
B	nice
A	sit on the comfy cushions and read a book and look at the sea so
B	nice
A	I fancy that yeah
B	do that yeah
A	yay so anyway blah blah
B	good good good glad you've got it you've got the ball rolling and
A	yeah definitely definitely
B	yeah
A	so how are you? what have you been up to?
B	yeah I'm really good I'm good
B	I'm so strong
A	you are I know
B	getting stronger and stronger
A	yay
B	erm you know it's really funny if he really pushes it or I push myself and he sort of helps
A	mm
B	er
A	when did you see him again?
B	at ten today
A	today? oh my god
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos I ran home had a shower ate
A	mm
B	with a coat on and it's really hot
A	it's really hot outside I know
A	mm
B	erm so upper body really good erm I think sometimes
A	yeah
B	and then
A	other bits are yeah
B	so we were you know doing whatever and I was holding again this weight which weighs nothing half a bag of sugar and I was just like what?
B	that's enough oh so he was like
B	it's just like I'm so weak
A	oh my god have you ever been to a craniologist?
B	no
A	it's erm like a bizarre branch of osteopathy or erm chiropractic or whatever
B	mm
A	erm and they play about with bits in your head
B	mm
A	and I used to see this guy I think he was a chiropractor primarily erm but he would do these sort of strength test things
B	mm
A	by getting you to hold up an arm or push here or pull there or whatever and based on that and where he detected weaknesses
B	mm
A	he would then prod bits on my head and like really push into bits on your skull
B	mm
A	and then he'd like leave me to set for five minutes and then he'd come back and do the strength test again and it was so different
A	how weird is that?
B	mm
A	so yeah google that
B	mm
A	craniology it's erm
B	mm
A	yeah it's nuts I'm not sure of the science behind it but he obviously linked it in with chiropractic
B	yeah no it's just you know I really worked on you know if er if you notice like really quick improvements you tend to do that more than where the
A	mm
B	so those bits naturally become the weakest over time
A	yeah
B	so whereas I can fling around eighteen kilos with one arm like it's nothing
A	yeah
B	I can't hold a two kilogram plate in front of me with
A	in front of you yeah
B	without like dropping it or falling over
B	but oh it's all fine
A	good for you though
B	I'll get there
A	well I'm pleased you can walk again
B	I know cos I was when we got back I was just sort of googling it and if you tear or pull a muscle there's three stages
A	mm
B	and the first one is it hurts but you don't have any sort of noticeable limp er you know you can still walk the second one which is what I think I had but quite severely is noticeable limp hurts to do anything twinges
A	yeah
B	and a slow pain it hurts even when you're sitting or lying
A	yeah that was you
B	and then the third one is like completely fucked can't do anything at all ever
A	mm
B	and you hear when it happens you hear like a pop
A	oh okay
B	of like the muscle like coming into pieces
A	eh
B	I didn't have that one erm and it said
A	but you just had a bad number two?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it said sort of er a week two weeks until back to normal erm
A	you've been less than a week
B	yeah so
A	spirulina
B	well it still is sore and I said for the training on Monday we'll just have to do upper body again
A	mm
B	I don't want it to go bad
A	yeah
B	and with the calves I just said only bodyweight
A	mm
B	no
A	no additional
B	two-thirds of my bodyweight weight
A	jeez
B	erm
A	I know that's pretty crazy to start with really
B	mm yeah
A	and they're difficult muscles to warm up as well cos
B	uhu uhu
A	really you're sort of warming them up with your bodyweight cos that's
B	yeah
A	the minimum you can do and
B	yeah
A	sometimes that's just enough
B	so we'll just have to take it slowly
A	yeah
B	he said do you want to skip it all together? I said no
A	no
B	because that's stupid we'll just have to do it really sort of sensibly
A	yeah
B	er cos you know the my legs can hack a hell of a lot like they can take a lot of weight
A	mm
B	erm but apart from my calves can't
A	yeah
B	but they will eventually
A	yeah you can do calf raises every time you make a cup of tea or something
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and that will at least train sort of train the muscles to get used to working cos you don't
B	yeah
A	traditionally work those muscles unless you climb mountains every weekend
B	yeah or you're sort of reaching up to put stuff on shelves
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	anyway we'll see what happens
A	good for you that's brilliant
B	yeah so I'm feeling really good
A	cool
B	yeah and I just needed yesterday to you know just
A	stare at the wall?
B	well not necessarily stare at the wall but you know
A	mm
B	I cleaned on Wednesday when
A	oh yeah
B	I got in and then yesterday I just spent more time
B	you know doing boring stuff like clearing out the kitchen cupboards wiping them down and putting stuff back in in a more logical order
A	mm
A	yeah that's really cool
B	I think it just helps to get it done erm
A	and again to my mind the physical always always the last place to manifest so that's a lot of clearing out on the inside
B	mm
A	that's
B	yeah
A	you know now a lot more readable on the outside
B	yeah and I had like so much energy to do it I think
A	good
A	yeah
B	yeah so it's it needs
A	mm
B	it's
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	I find dust seems to accumulate incredibly quickly
B	yeah
A	I've no I've no idea why unless it's because it's been cold and people have been burning all sorts of shit
B	mm
A	cos there's generally a lot of black smoke chugging out of chimneys
B	mm mm
A	I just presume people have saved up all their plastic during the summer months
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and as soon as winter started burned it erm but yeah they do does seem to be a lot of black smoke out of chimneys maybe it's residue from that coming in
B	yeah I don't know
A	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	I don't know erm
A	no
B	it's cos your skin's drier in winter anyway I suppose
A	for sure
B	don't know erm but finally it's er some sort of assemblance of order
A	yeah
B	cos
A	good on you
B	I did my reports
A	yeah
B	and half done my CV
A	yeah
A	I took mine down to one side of A4 reasonably spaced and it just I found it a relief to be ruthless
B	I mine was one side of A4 er and I asked on Twitter and it was like you know because I've got loads of work experience working in retail what's that how is that relevant? so I've just written I have six years of work experience er of working in retail full stop don't need to say where and where who gives a fuck? no
A	yeah
B	ring a shop and go oh
A	yeah
B	so like
A	yeah
B	about me
A	if you've got space and could be arsed you could add a sentence or two of transferable skills
B	it's obvious though
A	from six years in retail I developed great interpersonal skills
B	yeah
A	and I can relate to everybody blah blah blah
B	I just don't think it's
A	this is true
B	and you know so I'm really and then I was like right no do it on two pages and I was like oh but it looks so nice on one
A	mm
B	and you know if I if I was looking at CVs and it had everything on one page I'd be like well they're obviously
A	mm
A	yeah
B	are you still harping on about Duke of Edinburgh you did when you're fifteen and you're now twenty-seven?
A	yeah
B	get a grip like
B	you you know
A	yeah
B	move on move on but I'm putting it into two pages with quite hefty erm bits for each school including you know the textbooks that I used
A	mm yep
B	mm
A	so no two CVs of yours
B	yeah
A	look the same
B	yeah
A	yeah I did recruitment for in various job roles for donkey's years and I didn't take CVs
B	mm
A	and if people didn't read the big thick bold print that said people who send CVs will have their applications ignored then
B	mm
A	you know more fool them so I used to ignore those and that stopped a lot of on-spec applications
B	mm
A	and people just firing them off which frankly pissed me off I wanted to know that people want not just a job but my job
B	mm
A	and they wanna work for my organisation as part of my team
B	mm what? so was it er like a a form with questions?
A	yeah so it was a form with questions saying you know not even some quite often with jobs you'll get the job description person specification and then it'll say look at that and then fill in the boxes to say how it applies erm but no I mine were more specific in saying for this role you need this this and this skill tell us about a time when you have used these skills
B	mm
A	give examples erm so it's much more specific and it was the sort of application that if you did it properly would take a long time to fill in
B	yeah
A	but hopefully you then get the right people I mean
B	mm
A	and you do get people who are shit at filling in forms but brilliant at doing the job
B	yeah
A	and you can spot them a bit
B	mm
A	if they've had you know six years at this place which is similar
B	yeah
A	and ten years at that place which is similar whatever so
B	mm
A	had very high staff turnover one charitable organisation that I worked for in the first two years I pretty much
A	and got new people in who were magnificent made a big difference to the effective running of everything it was wonderful erm but because of that and I had so much
B	did you fire them? or force them out? or
A	erm people had the choice to get up to the standard or to go away
B	mm
A	and people that wanted to get up to the standard I was very supportive
B	mm
A	with training
B	mm
A	and erm also sending them to other shops and sort of buddying them up with other managers
B	yeah
A	who they could take to and would support them as well erm some people couldn't be arsed
B	yep
A	didn't really like the job they were doing anyway and probably better off out of it quite frankly and then and so I brought in very passionate people who loved what they were doing loved the team and brought that energy to the table which was wonderful but anyway yeah so I used to do a lot of shortlisting usually with a bottle of wine of an evening erm but you do get a feel for it and that passion comes through
B	mm mm
A	in what you read
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I don't think it will it changes mm really
A	yeah
B	between jobs between schools that you're applying for
A	I don't know when I was looking there were a lot that said you'll mostly be teaching young learners or
B	mm yeah well yeah but I wouldn't be applying for those jobs
A	okay yeah me either
B	so yeah if it was like you know er business English I wouldn't apply for that job either so
A	mm
B	I don't need to really big up that I've done business English
A	yeah
B	erm but if it's teaching Cambridge exams that's what my CV is so
A	yeah Cambridge exams teenagers
B	mm
A	adult speaking classes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	some business English some teaching
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	crime and the justice systems
A	oh that's cool yeah
B	perpetrator
A	very good
B	yes
A	you're very good doing that my
B	mm
A	and erm
B	nice yeah I did bucket lists actually after
A	brilliant lesson
B	as part of erm after Christmas as part of like New Year
A	yeah
B	New Year slash bucket lists
A	mm
B	because
A	mm
B	and because I was you know a bit ahead of the Polish teacher so I had like a week to kill
A	yeah
B	erm and it was really good so we did erm ranking New Year's resolutions
A	mm
B	compare with your partner see if you're sort of similar people
A	yeah
B	do you have any advice? if your partner finds weight loss really easy whereas you find reading books really easy can you say?
A	excellent
B	and what advice do you have for that person?
A	that's good
B	it was just like any way to get them to talk about it
A	good discussion yeah
B	erm so
A	oh yeah
B	and do you have dreams? do you have ambitions? and language for dreams and ambitions and then bucket lists
A	mm
B	what do you think would be on it? what would be on yours? look at the top forty decide er which ones you would do or like to do using this language like
A	mm
B	like what? oh I don't know I think there'd be some
A	ah brilliant
B	and then someone'll go whatever floats your boat
A	that's great as well
B	really funny like
B	each to their own
A	brilliant I like that
B	yeah
A	I mean that's proper target language that's great
B	really really funny
B	and a good lesson to do sort of after Christmas when you just want a bit of a natter
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah it's interesting seeing my guys this week after having a week off and erm
B	mm
A	he's spoken no English he's spoken Polish and a bit of Italian while he's been on holiday
B	mm
A	a movie or erm an episode of Friends every single day
B	oh is this the one with the erm where it gives you
A	yeah
B	the translations
A	it's in English and you get English subtitles and at any time you can pause it and highlight the bit of the subtitle that you don't understand
B	yeah and save it for later
A	and and look at what it means in Polish and then you can save it for later and you can look for each episode you can do a print out a little review of what you learnt from that episode
B	that's nice
A	and you can build it up over time as well to build up you know it's like a vocab build-up over time
B	uhu
A	it's brilliant absolutely brilliant and I said to him at the end of the lesson you know I expected you to be a little bit slower or to have difficulty finding the words
A	and he said that he felt it was a good erm a good lesson and he felt that it flowed very well and he found it very easy and that's what he put it down to
B	mm
A	so exposure to the language I thought that was really interesting but it's obviously in a way that works for him as well and I think with
B	yeah
A	yeah so that probably helps him that it's in that format
B	yeah well I didn't do any Spanish on Tuesday Wednesday
A	mm
B	Monday Tuesday Wednesday
A	we were away yeah
B	erm and yesterday I did about three hours and it was the first hour I was just like oh god I can't remember any of these words
A	wow
A	and do you do it while you're doing other stuff? cleaning
B	no I can't
A	no? no
B	I've gotta really
A	no I can't
B	sit and
A	yeah and concentrate
B	do it yeah no music nothing
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	no new language at all apart from at the end
A	yeah
B	but it was just reviewing and reviewing and reviewing I was just like oh gosh
B	no it's more complicated than that now
A	yeah
B	I have spoken to my brother
A	oh very good
B	which is quite exciting
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah good stuff
B	so
A	my Polish I'm still on it is bank? it is studio? is it a bank or a studio?
B	oh no
A	it is a studio yes?
B	so just abandon ship completely
A	ah
B	I'm at this level where I can just do whatever I need to do in in a day
A	mm
B	mm
A	erm and I'll write
B	but is it useful though? if you need if
A	well I've been looking again at these work away websites and I think I'm gonna do a little tour of Poland
B	mm
A	for summer and autumn er Argentina I dunno I'm kind of attracted to Portugal Spain now
B	yeah
A	Portugal particularly erm for the winter months there seem to be so many opportunities and so many little eco villages all over Portugal
B	uhu
A	I was so surprised and places that are looking for people over winter as well
B	mm
A	have specifically said there are winter tasks here erm a lot of it is basic DIY and painting and decorating
B	nice
A	I was a painter and decorator for six months
B	oh so you've got the skills
A	way back when yeah so I've got the skills and I love it so yeah I can help out with that over winter I just thought that'd be really nice and they had lots of places sort of between the mountains and the sea so it seems if you believe you know the distances that they've
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	put on their little profile pages so that was good so yeah so Polish will be helpful but then erm either Spanish or Portuguese
B	mm
A	probably Portuguese
B	mm
A	so
B	how exciting
A	I know
B	so good for you
A	yeah and a lot of the Polish places actually were with erm Polish families where they don't speak any English
B	uhu
A	or they've got a younger child who speaks English but they don't live there
B	yeah sure
A	but you can talk to them on Skype sort of thing so I think that's probably the best way to learn a language
B	mm
A	rather than hanging out with Polish people who are English teachers
B	yeah sure
A	yeah tend not to learn so much but
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but I just think
A	no that's fair enough
A	mm
B	I just feel a bit like I'm sort of wasting my time when I could be doing er
A	yeah
B	the Spanish where you know it's easier and you the progress is really noticeable
A	yeah
B	er
A	it's good
B	sense of achievement I guess
A	good
B	long term
A	yeah
B	yeah like super long term
A	yeah
B	you know more likely to be in in Spanish speaking countries or
A	yeah
A	yeah a lot of Polish people can I know
A	if in doubt look for somebody in their twenties or younger
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
A	it's good
B	gonna just start a little bit of the work over the weekend so that next week isn't so much of a shock
A	what? lesson plans and?
B	yeah
A	yeah good on you
B	just er just a couple it'll only take a few hours and then I won't have to erm
A	mm
B	really panic
A	oh and both
A	so if you like
B	uhu
A	I can give them your Polish number and just meet for a coffee and a chat and see what you both think or are you thinking definitely no?
B	ah
A	if you if you're not inclined to do it
B	I really need to think about it because
A	yeah
B	you know it would be great to have the money and you know it's only an
A	mm
B	I think that's part of it like
A	mm
B	I dunno
A	so if you think about
B	mm
A	and you're paid thirty thirty-five złoty for this there's very little prep it's an hour and you get sixty and they come to your house and there's no travelling so you've got no travel time very little prep time all of your money is yours
B	and what are their availabilities?
A	erm I see
B	mm
A	so he could probably be quite flexible
B	mm
B	mm
A	and then drives when it's exactly time
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and he leaves exactly on time
B	uhu uhu
A	yeah
B	so it's a hundred and twenty a week?
A	mm
B	what's that a month?
B	yeah so it's a lot ain't it?
A	mm
B	yeah so I could do
A	mm
B	yeah erm
A	erm oh actually I think Thursday he's at
B	uhu
A	he sees
B	mm
A	if it's not possible it's not possible if it is it is but
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	and you probably want your weekends to yourself
B	Fridays at eight
A	mm
B	really really sad about it
A	mm
B	but erm I'll really think about it I will
A	yeah yeah and you can also meet in a café you know if you finish at the court at a certain time you could always meet in the café near
B	yeah yeah
A	that's a possibility you know
B	cat
A	here's a nice jumper do you want to sit on this? oh
A	what's that?
B	yeah no he's tired
B	he's not sure
A	no not sure
B	mm
A	yeah it I liked when it had snowed and I felt reassured that I was surrounded by cats because there there were zillions of paw prints all over my garden
B	mm mm mm
A	and squirrel prints as well but mostly cats and then yeah now the snow's gone
A	but then I did see
B	I can't believe it's so nice
A	I can't believe it's so warm it's crazy
B	well it said seven on my phone which isn't very warm
A	no
B	but it's
A	yeah
B	when the sun's out
A	yep definitely
B	I saw Mr and Mrs next door this morning
A	mm
B	and they were dead nice they're so old
A	oh
B	she is so Mrs next door is so old
A	good possibly deaf don't hear the parties
B	I think so
B	er but you know er she was talking away
A	okay
B	you know how when people don't
A	yeah
B	know how to speak to someone who's foreign so
A	yeah
B	they still speak fast using lots of words
A	lots of their colloquial language probably
B	and he was just saying like simple words like teacher and I was like
B	er
A	no
B	and then she said erm oh I can't say anything in English and he said she can't speak English
A	ah that's nice though
B	so I feel a little bit kind of oh but I suppose
A	yeah
B	it has been you know six weeks nearly since any loud
A	yeah
B	loudness
A	yeah that's good
B	so hopefully they'll start to forgive me
A	oh I'm sure and er also if you know people who know them then that'll help as well
B	mm
A	cos they won't want to be horrible to you in case that dents
B	yeah
A	their friendship with the mutual friend
B	yeah
A	so
B	I don't see enough of anyone anyway
A	yeah
B	for it to be a problem
A	but I can see your household being quite a peaceful one now
B	he is really quiet
A	it's fantastic
B	and I don't know whether you know I should be doing more
A	no
B	he doesn't drink coffee he only drinks beer I don't drink beer er
A	mm
B	do you wanna do something? I can just imagine him being like no
A	yeah
B	so
A	or whatever oh I don't mind
B	yeah
A	what do you think? ah yeah
B	I was like not pissed off but I'd come back and the
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so I just sort of did a sort of er
B	erm
A	did you huff and tut a bit?
B	no I didn't
B	I was just sort of getting on with it
A	yeah
B	you know cos he always
A	mm
B	hooked onto a kitchen cupboard
A	right
B	and yesterday he came in and was like oh is there a dustpan and brush? and I was like yeah it's in the cupboard under the sink and he sort of opened the cupboard and went oh like he hadn't realised there was a cupboard there
B	and a bin
A	and a bin oh no
B	so this morning when I came out there was like loads of stuff in the bin and I was like he's literally not known there's been a bin in that cupboard
A	that's hilarious
B	so
B	it's just like where does he think my rubbish is?
B	like just like piling rubbish in my room
A	yeah
A	oh
B	just heard this like noise from the kitchen
B	it's like oh god
A	funny fella
B	he's just not got a clue
A	yeah yeah
B	what's going on has he? I bet he's been thinking this is such a stupid flat with no bin
A	he probably hasn't even thought about a bin or
B	yeah
A	you know the
A	yeah
B	I was you know laughing
A	yeah
B	it was alright
B	that'd be like it
A	it was alright
B	it was alright
A	ah funny fella
B	but he must think I'm equally boring cos I go to sleep you know at ten o'clock at night and
A	I would imagine a man that doesn't think I wonder if there's a bin in this entire house probably has no thoughts about you whatsoever
A	he's probably not really that aware that he's sharing a flat
B	yeah
A	I just mean from the viewpoint of you know how far his conscious ideas extend
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	not really beyond his own room I don't think
B	uhu

B	uhu uhu
A	make it as easy as possible for them to do the right thing
B	I know so when I'm doing this CV all I'm doing is like erm upgrading what's already written there but what I really need to do is sit and write
A	yeah
B	write it out and sit and brainstorm erm ideas
A	yeah
B	and then put it in as well
A	so you're an employer and you're looking at twenty forms what do you want to read?

A	partner's passing where they were sort of random people on the periphery of my awareness if you know what I mean?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and I hadn't really said thank you for your kind thoughts and so I just popped a couple of cards in the post without any contact details

B	sending my friend a book er it's the book that I'm reading but I think he'll like it
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
B	we've known each other since we were sort of fifteen and he used he lived really round the corner so we used to go round and you know smoke and drink in his back yard
A	mm
B	have loads of parties
A	nice
B	and stuff where by the end of the night we'd all sort of sit around in a heap in his smallest bedroom in the world
A	ah
A	ah
B	erm
A	mm
B	he's on and off
A	mm
B	and he just you know
A	yeah
B	erm so but whenever I do
A	poor guy
B	see him it's really nice and we talk about books that we've read and you know reviews and what we recommend
A	mm
B	hi and we do a quiz
B	we do lots of quizzing
A	have you noticed how I was gonna say the cat ignores the person that's making the noises
A	and he looks at the one that isn't so you're looking at her cos she she ignored you hello? it's me that was talking to you come and love me
B	yeah so we went I went round his house
B	and he'd collected erm a quiz from loads of newspapers erm
A	mm
B	and you know he'd done some with his mum and then he quizzed me
B	out no out of
A	oh okay
B	cos she'd quizzed him he'd quiz her all different questions
A	mm
B	said there were a hundred and twenty questions and we got exactly the same answer overall
A	oh my god
B	so we were sort of like oh
A	yay
B	neither of us are more intelligent
A	perfect
B	we're exactly the same
A	yeah
B	er according to the BBC or whatever
A	cool you're doing really well on that aren't you?
B	well I'm
A	yeah
B	so and it's not very many on the one hundred books you should read before you die
A	mm
B	cos these books are written by the patriarchy
A	yeah
B	and I read interestingly David Bowie's top one hundred books
A	oh
B	and there were two women on the whole list so I thought fuck you I'm not reading any
A	what?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	how bizarre
B	so I'm just
A	you'd've expected better from him
B	yep
A	anyway
B	so
B	only reading books written by women so I've sent him
A	good for you
B	this book that I'm reading at the moment sent my dad erm just a case for his tablet that he wanted and I'll buy him Game of Thrones DVD when it comes out in March
A	cool
B	and that's it so I need to send some cards
A	my latest book
B	nice
B	god
A	yeah energetic personality essence I like that
A	yeah it's channelled through a woman though so
B	uhu
A	if that counts but
B	I saw something online about erm a school er a high school that asked its students to say what gender they were as part of a study and there were twenty-three options
A	mm wow
B	but like no definitions for the options
A	okay
B	so unless you like knew
A	yeah
B	the gender you were sort of for sure
A	unless you agreed the understanding behind what was meant by a particular term
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm but it was like really it's interesting they said boy girl male female
A	oh right
B	as though you might sort of
A	yeah
B	as opposed to a
A	how interesting
A	yeah
B	and then sort of non-binary binary
A	binary what?
A	huh?
B	yeah so
A	it's interesting
B	non-binary you're not either
A	if
B	or you're somewhere in between
A	yeah
B	or
A	oh er binary yeah as in both I think we're all kind of both and neither
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah I mean you know physiologically speaking
B	yeah
A	most people can be defined by one or the other but
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	gender fluid would be er it depends on your day
B	or what's you know in the wash or
B	well I've only got the two
B	don't
A	so female today
A	ah dear it does seem a little bit pointless in so many regards
B	mm
A	it's a bit like erm in Northern Ireland they still ask you are you catholic? prod? or?
B	mm
A	whatever and
A	I had to tick catholic because you know I'm very anti religion as you know and anti dogma but erm you had to tick the catholic box if you lived in a catholic community
B	oh
A	and I lived in a very predominantly catholic community
B	uhu uhu
A	where even people that don't believe in god all still
B	yeah
A	or on Saturday night erm
B	so yeah and I think stuff like religion and stuff like sexuality
A	mm yeah
A	gender I mean how many ways can humanity divide itself?
B	yeah
A	and it's all part of divide and conquer I mean really you just tick human
B	yeah
A	but I wonder if there might even come a point where humans as a species don't even necessarily identify as human because they recognise extra energetic personality essences
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	which are form part of their humanity but are a larger part of themselves
B	I'm sort of torn by this and I don't have an answer really as to the sort of question of labelling should we label each other? should everybody be put in this box?
A	no
B	er to identify themselves but then I
A	mm
B	but at the same time then how do you
B	yeah like it's you know you need to monitor you well you don't need to monitor
A	yeah
B	think it should be monitored and stuff erm there
A	mm
B	things you there should be some degree of erm identification
B	but I I've really not thought about it enough to know but I know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	then again it depends on your definitions behind each of those
B	yeah
A	what assumptions are built into them all and likewise you know with the whole catholic prod thing you know I'm about as catholic as Ian Paisley erm but I had to tick catholic because that was how that particular box was
B	uhu
A	identified I had to say you know I am from a catholic community so it's bollocks really
B	mm
A	so when they're looking at job statistics and say oh this job went to a catholic well it fucking well didn't
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	craziness but no I think er it's Denzel Washington or one of those other black Hollywood actors who plays the heroic black character in all of these films erm who said that the whole black and white issue is only gonna stop when we stop labelling people as black or white
B	mm
A	erm and you know I grew up in
B	mm
A	every colour under the sun every religion erm there was a guy at school with a turban there was another guy went off to pray five times a day there were people who opted out of er Christian based assemblies erm
B	mm
A	until I was probably
B	mm
A	and there were all sorts of banners in football grounds about kicking racism out of football and
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	the newspapers were full of erm oh there was a monkey chant when this black player was substituted on isn't it disgraceful? blah blah blah I had absolutely no idea
B	uhu
A	that this existed erm before that time so you know it kind of begs the question are we really creating a rod for our own backs
B	mm
A	by having all of these distinctions and definitions? maybe if we just didn't bother then they wouldn't exist
B	don't know
A	mm
B	don't know what the answer is
A	yeah
B	shall we have a wonder?
A	a wonder? or a wander?
B	er a wonder
B	wander I don't think the
A	I was wondering about another coffee but it's such a beautiful day let's wander
B	yeah can we?
A	yeah
B	we can always come back or move on
A	okay so say goodbye
B	bye
A	and then I need to find an off button oh slide to unlock okay
