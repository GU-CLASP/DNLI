A	if they did food you wouldn't want to eat it
B	yeah
A	I haven't been there  I haven't been there  so I don't know but I should imagine they've done a lot yeah
B	me neither
A	so you will you if you would you go out for something to eat then if it if you knew a few places that were places you might like to go?
B	if we knew beforehand then yeah but the trouble is
A	yeah
B	it's all going to be absolutely booked up because it's Mothering Sunday
A	that's true  that's true  It is all booked up isn't it really? The only place I could think of that might not be is do you know  do you know  the um
B	yeah
A	Cos they're always I mean to me they seem they're hunting customers really
B	mm
A	so that might be somewhere to go
B	I think so yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah my son made me a card at playgroup
A	that was really sweet
B	yeah he made it yesterday with when he went to the mother and toddler group with my mother-in-law
A	my daughter made you know she'd made she got she thought it was last Sunday
B	mm hm
A	so she thought Mother's Day was last Sunday
B	ah that's quite sweet really yeah
A	that's really sweet isn't it? So she hasn't been to the shops or anything she just got these little tokens
B	oh I look forward to the time when my son can give me tokens for hoovering and cleaning if it ever happens
A	so how old is your kid?
B	well his uh a twenty-one month old so
A	oh yeah
B	he's quite small
A	so the hoover is probably still quite interesting
B	oh yeah he's fascinated by it
A	fascinated
B	just every time I hoover he just you know he just wants to grab it and just do it all himself
A	I remember that
B	how do things change? Yeah
A	yeah
B	just to see what he would play with naturally
A	mm
B	and sadly so far it's always been cleaning equipment
A	mm
B	he seems to enjoy playing with that
A	so you just take him somewhere and just let him
B	just out of interest really we don't necessarily buy it for him but you know just just to see what he would be interested in you know
A	that's that's good cos my son was pretty similar
B	yeah
A	like a hoover or a brush or a
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's like if you if he watches adults doing something he wants to do the same thing you know
A	I seem to remember tool kits as well
B	oh yeah
A	he loved tool kits
B	yeah we tried to hide the one that's uh
A	does he try and get in it? Does he try?
B	yeah very much so
A	have you tried buying him little plastic tools and things but they're just not the same are they? They want the real thing
B	he knows  He knows  they're not real so he wants to play with the actual grown-up toys and obviously the the iPhones and iPads and things like this you know he just loves it yeah
A	yeah
B	and the same on the iPad as well it's got different apps for like you know piano and you know drums that sort of thing
A	I bet he's just so he that age it's quite  it's quite  intense isn't it? It's quite full on
B	yeah
A	but it does give you that break as well doesn't it?
B	uh if you call it a break
A	mental difference isn't it? It's just a
B	I think so
A	even though it's something you enjoy I mean like spending time with your son is is enjoyable
B	yeah
A	but doing that all the time can get a bit too intense
B	hmm
A	like when I was
B	well maybe
A	I was really keen to to just mix and match up my life a bit as well so that um I had that adult time as well as being with them and
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	you see?
A	oh yeah see that's that's something that you
B	yeah definitely but then you know I wish I could sort of you know maybe go part time or something like that but it's not the right job to go part timing sadly
A	it isn't really is it?
B	no well
A	no but it's because it's a day in day out job isn't it really? It's not gonna that's what I like about mine
B	yeah
A	and also at the moment it's been very full-on cos we've been looking for new staff but luckily we've got two new staff starting so yeah you should have an easier time
B	yeah
A	me too
B	hmm
A	and they hardly take any new supply in on now
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	eh he's a primary school teacher
A	hmm
B	and what he did when we first moved into this area from
A	hmm
B	so he wouldn't mind doing some more supply cos he's um he's temporary now and he's got another temporary one uh starting from Easter as well
A	hmm
B	he'd love it to become permanent but if it doesn't he would be quite happy to just uh do supply or something you know
A	hmm
B	I think there was some sort of new building and you know she just opened that new building or something
A	she was just there for yeah
B	yeah he said she looked exactly the same as she normally looks like on the photos and that
A	she incredible I find cos she's a very
B	yeah
A	and she always looks very um fit and um well you know her she looks really great really I think
B	well I think she's doing brilliant
A	mm
B	right
A	and years and I said uh I'm going to meet my friend there why don't we go there? So we went there
B	yeah
A	and it seemed to be all the sort of plant pots on the outside and it was all looking lovely and Prince Charles was there
B	amazing I actually live next to
A	yeah
B	and we just walk there you know it's brilliant
A	it's lovely isn't it?
B	yeah
A	they're extending it a lot aren't they?
B	yeah
A	and um I
B	yeah of course yeah that's
A	it became a national thing because in the papers it was there at a time every paper was talking about the snowdrops at
B	yeah
A	and how many different varieties of snowdrop there are and did you know that there are this type and that type and
B	I think so
A	they've extended their um cafeteria as well haven't they?
B	they did yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah they do photo walks and all sort you know when it's the snowdrop snow drop season
A	yeah
B	you know
A	I've never been on I've just been on the walks or have I? I haven't been on a guided walk or anything like that but I've been around the gardens
B	well you don't really to you just kind of have to go and explore at your own leisure really you know?
A	yeah
B	my husband normally just um takes my son on Sunday you know and goes to
A	what a nice place to live though just down there
B	yeah
A	just down on your doorstep isn't it?
