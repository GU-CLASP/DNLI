B	they fall out?
A	have one another on a bit now and again
A	so

A	but they
A	well
B	mm?
B	but she goes
A	well she goes
B	under duress
A	yeah yeah
B	it's awkward isn't it if you don't?
A	well the kids don't mind but I don't think anyway they'll shrug it off but I don't think
B	oh yes I haven't been there for a long time
A	that's next to the river
B	oh so that'll be getting
C	mm
A	well
B	I don't know I can't remember
A	but it were flooded bottom well it's be the mill and the
B	oh
B	oh
A	the
B	yes
A	but the
B	higher up
A	higher up er it'd have
B	I can't remember where it is
A	I can't see it getting into
B	no no
A	well if you go get going on road to
B	yes
A	and it's on the left going in the that way
A	mm before you get to
B	oh I know where you mean
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's nursery there er
B	yes yeah
A	opposite really
B	somebody had been there and said it was quite good the meal there
A	er well I think it's not so bad
B	the
A	yeah
B	somebody said it had gone off then somebody else said oh it's er they had been and they'd enjoyed it so I don't know
A	I got sirens going now
C	mm
B	can you?
C	mm
A	yeah
C	they're all over the place
B	I hope we don't get lights going off again they've only just
A	aye
B	got back to normal
A	well if the
B	they said there isn't a warning for this area yet
A	not yet no
B	on the er
A	if
B	mm
A	that is
B	you were alright though weren't you?
C	mm
A	we were alright it's a civilised place you see is
B	I was surprised though that you didn't get it
C	I know
A	our electric's
C	everywhere else did
A	funny in
B	well
A	yeah
B	and yet up there up
A	yeah
B	up the little cul de sac
A	yeah
B	they must be on a different one because theirs'll or one side of the road
A	yeah
B	theirs'll be off er and mine'll be on or vice versa
C	mm
A	mm well that's how it goes isn't it?
B	mm mm
A	so no we never got er well er we did get a we did get a little blip didn't we? because the tellies went off
C	oh yeah only
C	very briefly though
B	yeah
A	but it did enough to turn the telly off and then it takes three days before it comes back on again
B	why's that?
A	I don't know there's a component
A	it's a fault
B	yes
A	at repairs
B	yeah
A	and er oh he said I know what that is he said it's er a little component in the back he said it's a faulty component and
B	and yours comes into that?
A	but he said we can put another component in er I think he said it would be seventy quid or something like that because he said he has to take the screen out to get into the
B	back
A	where the component is
C	mm
A	so that was
B	yeah
A	and then take the thing
C	you'd think Panasonic would fix it though
C	yeah
B	yes yeah
B	that's what they do with the cars
A	that's what they should have done but obviously they don't
B	mm
A	want to do they? the cost but he said that that's what it is he said I know what it is I know exactly what it is but he couldn't really understand
B	mm
A	in the
C	mm
A	set and it takes about three days don't it?
B	which is
C	mm
B	awkward isn't it?
A	well it is if you've only one telly
B	yeah
C	mm
B	oh
A	all the time
B	oh oh
A	it's a strange thing
B	funny thing
A	yeah it's a strange
C	mm
A	carry on
B	never heard of that
A	and it's works perfectly alright when it's
B	when it's
A	yeah
B	when it's on
A	perfectly alright
B	or if it's running alright yeah
A	nothing wrong with it you wouldn't think there was anything wrong with it
B	no
A	so we've resisted repairing them
A	and we just put up with it
A	right you've no telly now for three days
B	mm
A	which we hadn't
B	and is this while you've had your visitors?

C	mm
A	it was good one
B	was it a frozen one? or a fresh?
C	no it was fresh
B	it was fresh
A	it was a good one
B	yeah
A	cos it there were six of us and there was enough seven of us and we still had a a lot left
B	some
A	I think
C	mm
A	I think
B	yeah

B	do they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm oh good
A	so it was very good that goose yeah it was a good one cos normally we haven't that sort of meat we you know it's a massive big frame with that
C	well it's
A	but she'd also cooked another bird but we never touched it you see
B	yeah so if you got that today
A	but somebody in their infinite wisdom has turned the switches off our fridge
B	oh who would?
A	well nobody's owning up to it
C	mm
A	but there's one particular person who's a very thorough cleaner and we have our suspicions that that's what's happened
B	oh
A	so the fridge has gone off
B	oh dear
C	mm
A	so now it's on full charge but hopefully we haven't ruined everything in it
B	yeah well you see mine went off when we had that cut
A	yeah
B	in the electricity they say if you keep fridge
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	er that it's alright
A	well hopefully it is otherwise I'll
B	so I kept my freezer door shut
B	but I had to open the top you have to open the top to get in the
A	we'll have bad stomachs again if not
A	it's just your head isn't it?
B	yeah
B	my legs
A	what you were off your legs with it
B	no I was bad on my legs yesterday morning
B	I didn't feel before I went out
A	your legs
B	yeah I didn't feel so good on my
A	if you stop your legs
A	there might not be anything wrong with your legs if you stop the drinking
B	that was before I'd had anything at all
A	ah we
B	I think I had a a couple of coffees
A	I had a look in that in that bottle box and there ain't half some bottles of whisky empty bottles of whisky in there I'm wondering if your legs are perfectly alright
B	I've got some whisky in there
B	I've got some whisky bought yesterday
A	yeah
B	my aye
A	oh
B	er who do you call it? er
A	oh
B	and then between them they bought me a big bottle of er
A	oh right
B	Croft sherry
A	oh that'll be nice
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
A	well very good
A	well if you can't have a little tipple at Christmas it's
B	well that's what I think I
A	well
B	I cut it down a bit because my blood count you know
B	the Warfarin was too thin
A	yeah
B	and I thought well I'm drinking I was having wine well you see if I open a bottle of wine I have to drink it if nobody comes I have to drink it all myself so I I don't drink it all in one day
A	well just you just have to haven't you? I mean
A	you
B	no I wouldn't
A	once you've
B	so
B	I thought I'll have to cut down because
B	I think I mean my my blood's getting too thin
B	so hopefully it'll be alright next time
A	no it doesn't really do you a lot of damage unless you're silly drinking the amount that you drink
B	well
A	yeah but you only have a tot at night don't you?
B	yeah
A	well
B	and I don't have it every night anyway

B	but you drink more at Christmas time
C	mm
A	yeah well everybody does
B	you know than you do at other times

A	you can walk round there
B	I
A	what do you mean really now?
A	you've done it a few times
B	yeah yeah I haven't done it recently
A	ah you will do a little bit but as as
B	I haven't done it recently
A	the more you do it the less you'll get out of breath and you'll be alright no time at all you'll be running back there
B	I'll be jogging next
A	yeah you will
B	jogging round the block mm I wish I could I wish I wish
A	it'll come
B	it won't it's too late for me now
A	never too late
A	it's never too late
A	you should make yourself do it you matter if it takes you half an hour long it doesn't matter
B	hey you don't know what I feel like
A	I don't feel so good
B	I've never been so distressed in my life once when I walked back
B	to that post and there's a bit of shopping I put it on the floor and I came in and I
B	I I'll pick it up after
A	aye well it was yeah too hot you're overheated
B	we don't get so much hot weather
C	no
B	in this country
A	well the problem is that it if you if wet weather and windy weather is not very good is it?
B	no wind
A	if you're not
B	wind's no good for me it
A	no I mean I mean
B	but er I
A	a reasonable nice calm day you could probably be alright walking there and walking back steadily
A	steady well I know that you can do because the way you walked round round market at
B	yeah but I'm stopping
A	well there's nothing stopping you stopping here
B	I
A	well that
A	aye that's what you've got to do
B	there's a man and he used to speak to
A	yeah
A	aye
B	but he always used to stop up here it's er quite an incline that
A	yeah yeah
B	more
A	yeah
B	and then walks up
A	no
B	he has his wife with him
A	well there's nothing stopping you stopping you can have a little stop can't you? you're not in any rush
B	you can have a little stop but it isn't long enough that you can stop unless you sit on somebody's wall
A	well what's stopping you doing that?
B	well you get who wants to sit on somebody's wall when it's wet through?
A	take a bag yeah
A	take a bag with you
A	it's grand if you can do a bit
A	then all round blinking big shopping centre you walk all way round there that's four times up and down there you walked
B	yeah but you're not doing it continually
A	no
B	it's when you
A	you don't have to do it continually
A	you can do it nice and steadily
A	and in no time at all you'll find it easier and easier
C	mm
A	to do it
C	it's about time you took a dose of your own medicine
A	I walk
A	I walk quite a lot
B	yeah but you're a lot younger than me you forget that
A	yeah but it's only because I keep walking
B	yeah in age you're a lot younger than me
A	well I mean that's incidental
A	well there's nothing to stop
B	I don't
A	I know but he hasn't walked well for years but there's been nothing stopping him walking he just hasn't done
B	no he needs to
A	he just hasn't done any exercise
B	well that's up to him
A	and it's no good making excuses
A	cos he hasn't you don't get much exercise laid on sofa from morning to night
B	well I do
C	mm
A	well you probably do more than
B	well I will do I walk
A	yeah
B	round the house and doing my own work and that
A	well he
B	yeah
A	it's it's a lot of rubbish
B	well I don't know
A	and he should make himself walk a bit it would do him a lot of good
A	it would
B	yeah it's doing things though at times
A	you just have to force yourself a bit don't you?
B	well you do
A	mm
B	er when you go out shopping you have to force yourself
A	yeah yeah which you do
B	yeah but I don't go out much I

A	I wonder where it finishes I wonder what area they cover
C	I don't know if they had one in
B	I don't know
A	I wonder yeah
B	she hires people as well
A	yeah
C	I think it's just
B	I'll ask
A	where the branches go yeah
B	I don't know
A	I mean they must have more than half a dozen branches surely to
B	they've got one at
A	oh well there you go
B	it that's the one of that's the biggest
A	ah
B	that there was and I think there's one higher up somewhere
C	mm
A	well
B	you know more northern
A	there could be one at
B	yeah I think there is
C	yeah there's one in
B	I think there is
A	oh is there? oh well
C	I think so
B	but I think that one at
A	I don't know whether you get one
C	mm
A	is there?
B	mm
C	I think so mm
A	they've got to have quite a lot haven't they? but I
B	yeah
A	I mean I'm just wondering where
B	but her
A	the headquarters is
B	you know people that have gone to them older people they still stick with them don't they?
A	oh yeah well they wouldn't go anywhere else
B	and
A	but you need green wellies and tweeds really
A	to fit in don't you?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know
C	well a lot of it is very overpriced isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah they are cos a lady said to me
A	but you haven't got to
B	behind on the bus she said well I'm going to Tesco's when we were
C	mm
A	oh yes but you haven't got to mention price if you're a
A	I mean just disgraceful
A	you don't mention the price
A	honestly
B	I didn't mention it it was her
A	you cheapjack bus trippers
B	it was her that said that things are a lot
A	cheapjack bus trippers go away we don't want your kind
A	arguing over a penny
B	well we like to get a bargain
A	you're at
B	you like to get a bargain if you can
A	oh well I don't think you'll become a regular
B	no I won't er cos when we used to go through to
C	mm
A	we don't use
C	no
A	we used to
B	but everybody says it's too expensive
A	yeah
B	er to the but you see they're used to it these old there's an er one who goes on the bus I would think she's been a teacher
A	yeah
B	and er from
A	and she's not a skinflint
B	and she's a
A	yeah
B	and she er she had quite a few bags the other day
A	aye did you
B	and
A	have a look in them?
B	no
B	she likes buying flowers when she goes to Morrisons
A	yeah
B	she nearly always comes back with flowers
A	yeah
B	so
A	I like I quite like Morrisons really it's er
C	mm
B	well I do I quite like Morrisons
A	but I think er I think Tesco's have bucked their ideas up a bit in
C	yeah
A	they're better than they were
B	yes I don't think I don't know they're as cheap as Morrisons but there again they've have some things cheaper and some dearer than Morrisons
A	ah well that's how
B	or other way round don't they?
A	that's what happens everywhere
B	yeah
A	you see you could spend all day shopping
B	oh I couldn't no
A	and you should go in Morrisons first
A	and and and check the prices
A	and then you go into Tesco's
A	and check and you put make a list
B	would have been alright if they're at
A	the prices
A	and then the following week you know where to buy this and where not to buy that and
C	well they brand match
B	well they ought to
C	you at most places now don't they? so
B	yes
A	oh right
C	if
B	Morrisons do don't they?
C	if they're charging more than another supermarket they'll give you the difference back
A	oh they give you yeah they give you yeah
C	on the brands
A	yeah
C	the
B	yeah
C	branded products
A	yeah
B	well I think Sainsbury's is as
A	yeah
B	there wasn't as many supermarkets then
A	we hardly ever go into Sainsbury's
C	no we don't
B	no
A	hardly ever
B	I I've never been for years
A	it means going through town
B	it's quite
A	no we don't go to Sainsbury's much I don't think
B	but you see when we lived down south Sainsbury's was
B	I think a southern firm is it?
A	I don't know really
B	there was a lot of er and there wasn't as many supermarkets you had to choose from
C	mm
A	no plenty of competition up here anyway with the
B	oh too much really
A	probably
B	did you
A	Lidl?
B	mm
