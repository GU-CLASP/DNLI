A	yeah she came around and she was like erm I think
B	is this
A	yeah erm but she didn't text before so she just like knocked on the door and sort of turned up
B	mm
A	erm but then she was saying like erm she said oh I've not seen him in two weeks blah de blah and I was thinking well you could bloody come around and see him then
B	yeah
A	you don't have to like I'm not always gonna go to you erm and then erm
B	he's big for his age isn't he?

unknown_female	won't be long
A	see you later
B	bye
A	erm
B	this is the flat one?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	plus he don't really like it in there anyway like he much prefers it in that one and that one's suitable from birth anyway cos it reclines so he could have been in that from when he was born
B	yeah
A	but we just got the carrycot cos I dunno why erm and then she was like oh okay then and then she was like well maybe he's only like bigger because whereas like
A	and I was thinking erm
B	he no I don't think can you even over feed a child that much?
A	no I said he has what he has and he uses more energy by like trying to sit up like than like we'll like stand like holding him and sort of
B	mm
A	standing him up and that like so he's gonna
B	he uses energy
A	have like yeah I know and I was thinking oh do you know she's just making it sound like
B	just ignore her
A	I can't remember what else she said as well before and I was just thinking oh just please shut up like and then he kept crying and erm he was due a feed in about forty minutes so I said right I'll go and get his bottle ready then erm I was in the kitchen and I could hear her going you're not hungry you're not hungry and I was like you haven't been here how the hell do you know when he's due a feed? he is hungry I know he's hungry because I know
B	even if she had been here she I don't think there's any
A	yeah
B	there's she's got no place to say I know she's I know I said the other day she's a
A	no I was thinking he is hungry he's not far off a feed
A	yeah he needs burping actually
B	burping
A	and then she was saying
A	yeah and he was like crying and stuff and she kept like holding him in ways that he doesn't like you holding him like well apart from when he's like
B	not like a baby
A	when he's like really tired and he needs to go to sleep
A	like he likes being held like that
B	yeah
A	but not all the time and then erm I was like he wants to go in his bouncer and play cos he'd been like groggy all day but like because he'd actually woken up and I don't think he was tired because he'd been asleep
B	yeah you do know what you're doing
A	and then that was like the first time she's ever seen him in his bouncer apparently
B	is it?
A	eleven weeks ago
B	eleven
A	yeah
B	I keep forgetting it's Friday
A	so it just really annoyed me and I was just
B	eleven weeks
A	my mum says
B	yeah
A	like when she was saying oh I haven't seen him for
B	yeah
A	this is the first time you've come around for like a month
B	does she what did she say that you shouldn't leave it so
A	yeah and I was just thinking
B	well it's not your fault that they've not come enough
B	what are these noises?
A	just keep rubbing
B	chunky monkey
B	oh I'm sorry I love you really
A	we've been watching the Walking Dead today
A	and I was like I hope you don't turn
B	yeah
B	yeah and puppy paws whatever that programme?
A	Paw Patrol
B	Paw Patrol
A	he was watching Noddy this morning
B	oh I can't believe is that still on or is it like a?
A	it's a different version and I don't think I don't ever remember it though to be honest
B	is it with erm what's his name Noel Edmonds
A	I dunno
B	Noel
B	oh
A	that was like it's like shocked you as well his face just went oh
A	he did a burp in my face and it was like it absolutely stank I thought I was gonna be sick and I was like er
A	disgusting
B	definitely a lad
A	yep
B	he's starting early is that all of them? or are you just holding them all in?
B	oh it's like a
A	erm
B	oh no wait that's a
B	bless him
A	he started singing Bare Necessities and I was like no no no that's Lion King and I was thinking no it isn't Lion King's Hakuna Matata
B	yeah
A	but then I can only remember
A	I know I
B	that's all I know
A	daddy knows more doesn't he?
A	he's better at singing
B	what other Disney songs are there? do you know?
A	well they're all pre-six clothes and they're not exactly big on him are they?
B	no
A	yeah she has missed him
B	have you had cuddles from auntie
B	whoops
B	yeah I suppose
A	I said
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah that's true
A	yeah she was like there's a baby group in
B	what is all that stuff like play like feel?
A	baby sensory?
B	yeah
A	yeah I think so I think she creates sort of like
B	yeah
A	environments and stuff that like stimulates
B	have you got to be up early? yeah?
A	well he can stay in bed until I can get ready and then he can get up
B	yeah yeah do that
A	and I'll have to get myself out of bed and it's hard to get him up when
B	yeah
B	you've got to let mummy sleep through the night
A	I'm scared he won't sleep through tonight cos he's only he's gonna have to have a feed cos he's had this at half four unless he has another one at like half six and half eight so he has sort of then that's only two hours between feeds
B	so when does he usually have them like throughout the day?
A	he has one say he has one at like five
B	in the morning?
A	yeah then like nine twelve three six and then like eight say on average
B	like nine and twelve three six and eight
A	but when he was waking up at about say two three o'clock he'd still have sometimes he'd have seven bottles other times he'd have a longer stretch between so he wouldn't have like three-hour gaps so
B	mm
A	he was still getting sort of six to seven bottles
B	yeah so before he was having one between like eight and five
A	yeah
B	oh okay so he
A	but then last night he slept through until seven so he's not had that night feed so he's not had as many feeds today
B	oh yeah I see yeah
A	like but sometimes when he's slept like if he woke up say at about three so he had one at three in the morning
B	I can't even
A	no
B	he just went
A	oh he was startled
B	sorry was that too loud?
A	yeah but he'd usually have sort of seven to six bottles but recently it's been six because he's going that little bit longer at night without one
B	yeah
A	because he went from seven last night today it's been seven ten and one sort of four so maybe like seven seven and that's only five bottles and that's an earlier bottle as well so unless I can try and squeeze another one in between now and sort of eight so he has sort of two-hour gaps between them
B	mm
A	rather than three
B	yeah
A	cos otherwise I'm not I don't know if he'll sleep through because he's had like there's seven ounces less than usual
B	so he's had four so far today?
A	yeah
B	but by this time he would have had five or six?
A	yeah
B	no five
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I'm not
B	so he's only got one more to fit in?
A	yeah
B	technically
A	really but then say he starts getting hungry about like half six cos he hasn't seemed to have been lasting three hours today for some reason erm
B	yeah mm
A	so the gaps are getting shorter sort of thing cos I gave him eight ounces this morning which he like drank all of but then the ten o'clock one I did another eight but he only had six
A	so then it averages out at seven ounces anyway so then I've just made
B	oh
A	seven-ounce ones at one and four
B	but he had six is that what you're saying?
A	no he usually has seven
B	I'm slightly lost oh okay
A	he has seven all day apart from eight before bed but like because he'd gone so long last night I gave him eight this morning
B	oh okay I see yeah
A	so it's not because I was gonna try and give him an extra ounce in every feed so that he's not technically missing a bottle and gave him
B	but he just wasn't drinking?
A	yeah
B	you know what she's doing
A	so I may try and fit another feed in
B	you're just gonna wake him up at two in the morning?
A	yeah
B	yeah you don't know if it's like disruption of
A	and like he's gonna be in the lounge as well
B	routine
A	yeah
B	going to
A	yeah
B	what do you think?
A	because like as I said I don't know what's happened with like
B	yeah so he might be alright anyway
A	yeah but then also I said it could just be a phase like I don't expect I still expect him to get up at like two o'clock so anything later is a bonus really
B	yeah
A	because otherwise I'd be really like gutted if he started waking up at like three again
B	yeah
A	erm
B	he's just got the
A	but erm
B	just like your aunties and your grandparents
A	yeah then she was saying like oh I've got him into such a routine and she was like I don't know if it's just routine for him waking up and I'm like it's probably the problem
B	what? does she wake him up?
A	no but like
B	oh is it?
A	times and stuff so it's like well then his it probably is a routine for him whereas his nap times in the day if he's awake and happy I'll leave him awake when I know he starts getting tired I'll try and get him to sleep if he's hungry like less than three hours I don't like to give him too much but if he's really screaming I'd be like well sod it you're gonna have to have it then
B	yeah
A	or if he goes a little bit longer between a feed I'll let him go a bit longer
B	yeah
A	so it's not like
B	yeah like he's like dictating it to you
A	yeah like I think with
B	which is not a bad thing I don't think
A	no I mean I know eventually we'll have we'll have to start trying again into some sort of routine but
B	oh
A	yeah
B	you seem to be doing it well
A	I'm just sort of listening to him at the minute and
B	he's happy
A	he's like been like like like I said I don't think we've done anything differently for him to sleep through he's just started going a little bit longer cos every morning we'll wake up and
B	really?
A	and
B	what cos he thinks you would have got up in the night?
A	yeah
B	would he not wake up for that though?
A	for what his night?
B	yeah
A	who
B	would he not even notice that you've woken up to feed him?
A	he doesn't sometimes
B	oh God
A	most of the time he does but
B	what do you do?
A	refill the bottle up and so we go to bed at like eleven I fill the
A	I fill that up with boiling water
B	are you trying to explain too?
A	what are you saying? eh? oh oh
B	do you reckon he's a bit like I wanna sit up?
A	he's trying now
B	are you trying?
A	yeah I fill that up with erm
B	yeah
A	erm I fill it up with seven ounces of boiling water put it in his thermal bag thing and
B	oh
A	take a formula pot out and then when it gets to his night feed I just like take out the thermal bag and put the formula in it's obviously with him sleeping through it's cold
B	mm
A	so I will come down and tip a bit out and top it up with a bit of boiling water and then put it in
B	yeah
A	so it's the right sort of temperature I mean I know I shouldn't do that but
B	well he seems to be fine
A	and like if it's like say he sleeps till three and it is cold but it's not been cold
B	yeah
A	like but if he's not had a feed and like I think I'll give him a warmer breakfast
B	yeah well like our
A	oh I was gonna ask how is she getting on?
B	yeah I think she's alright
A	is she starting to speak better now or not?
B	I don't know I'm going I was gonna go around there yesterday but she was going out at six and she was like oh there's not gonna be enough time for us to catch up
A	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	oh yeah erm so I'm going over on Tuesday after work and I'll find out she hasn't said anything else apart from she just sent me a few photos of
A	let me see
B	there's a better photo of her but it's in black and white and I felt really bad cos I was like well maybe it looks good cos it's
A	edit
B	edited yeah
A	filter
B	filter
A	mm
A	uh-oh
B	are you joining in?
B	this is one this is a black and white one
A	oh yeah it looks like it's not
B	it's a bit straggly
A	fallen out at the front but it's like it's sort of comes from the back to like cover it yeah
B	yeah like a comb forward instead of a comb over
A	and I think you're cute I think you are
B	he looks I think he
A	yeah
B	I know that sounds stupid
B	yeah she is
A	what is up with you?
B	these are the recent ones
A	she doesn't have a baby nose does she?
B	no maybe that's it
A	like babies always have a flat sort of button nose whereas hers looks like a normal person's
B	yeah I think it's
A	his mum says they don't usually have like the bridge of their nose and stuff like yet
B	mm
A	but I think that she
B	she does you can tell in that photo I don't know if it's the light
B	what's the matter? do you need sleep?
B	was that a yes? did you just say yes?
A	oh
B	let's bounce you oh
A	bottles and pyjamas I have to do
B	I know
A	you see I don't know if I should try him in his grobag but then I'm like if he doesn't sleep I don't know whether it's cos he won't be tucked in and he doesn't like a grobag?
B	what is yeah maybe not tonight maybe tomorrow is that like a sleeping bag?
A	yeah it like zips up and it's like over there and then just
B	oh yeah yeah
A	it zips up like that
B	they're cute aren't they?
A	yeah cos he did kick all his blankets off but I think I tucked him in a bit better last night cos usually I put I did a blanket and then a sheet but the sheet's quite small cos it always just he'd pull it out but I put the blanket underneath and then the blanket is really long and I tucked that under so I think that'll hold the sheet in a bit more so he was still tucked in this morning
B	oh
A	unless he just wasn't as wriggly cos that one night Wednesday night when
B	is that because he gets really hot and he doesn't wanna be in the
A	I don't know
B	in the
B	if he's anything like
A	yeah I know
B	for the cold
A	then I always think he has a few blankets on and like a little vest and sleepsuit yet we're in like pyjamas with a massive quilt on us
B	yeah
A	and I sometimes get into bed and think oh it's chilly
A	like he's started being sick as well a bit recently and I don't know whether he's having too much milk for his belly but like he obviously is still hungry and he has it all
B	is it anything to do with the fast teat? oh that would have hurt
A	no
B	he just put his head into my earring
A	oh he always head-butts me
B	is it do you reckon he's getting like too much too ah
A	it might be it might just be that it's too much milk for his belly cos he was falling asleep in the other one so I made it that's two
B	yeah I can imagine what is that based on like how they suck it?
A	yeah
B	you just wanted to see me? did you?
