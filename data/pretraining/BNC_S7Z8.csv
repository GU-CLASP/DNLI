B	yeah
A	topic or subject of recording if applicable
A	signature
B	yeah I know
A	mm
B	but like done really cleverly you know
A	oh that's so
B	so this job um
A	oh the job yes
B	okay
A	I'll have a look this week or speak to Rachel about it but they're basically they are expanding the education group cos they're actually the only ones that are making any money
B	yeah
A	um I will actually speak to her and see if she knows any more about it
B	it would be yeah and it would I'd like that job I think
A	yeah it would be really good
B	two things yeah exactly
A	I mean maybe you could be
B	no that's true
A	Cos then if you cos obviously it's not me but it's
B	you did send it to me
A	yeah if you send it in to
B	and could you
A	you couldn't live off it
B	no
A	well not not
B	yeah
A	once you've started work at the Press and say you're a proofreader for CUP
B	yeah at least it'd be something extra wouldn't it
A	yeah because I mean
B	would help
A	the going rate is like nineteen pounds an hour
B	that's not bad
A	that's not bad at all
B	yeah
A	so you know it's it's nice it's a nice little bonus
B	if I had a couple of those and say like another job like a any like
A	yeah just a temping office job
A	if you're doing one of those a week or couple of those a month
B	then that'd be alright
A	mm
B	so it's doesn't really fit very well with teaching but with a normal job oh
A	that was her
B	why?
A	it's bad
A	oh bless her
B	why would she have to go under the knife
A	I dunno cos there's nothing of her
B	she's just hairy
A	she's just hairy
B	well she just needs to shave her arms
A	well a
B	oh
A	that whole catwalk is a bit of an issue as well because all those models are really pretty
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	well I was gonna call the doctors but basically I think if you can walk you haven't done yourself any serious damage
B	yeah
A	might have to walk
B	mm
A	Dearie me what the hell is that? Something's gone horribly wrong
B	yeah
A	I wonder whether I should put some clothes on and go out in the snow
B	oh dear
A	oh bless yeah
A	she actually puts curtains over her mirror
A	so she doesn't actually see herself naked
B	oh
A	that's mental
B	mm
A	bloody Nora
B	okay
A	I suppose as it's Sunday
B	is it hang on were there more pages?
A	uh one of three
B	can I read it?
A	yeah read read read away
A	what do you wanna do? I mean it's probably been an hour hasn't it since we called Panther
B	yeah
A	um just just as a bit of a just to see what's going on
B	do you get eighteen pounds for doing this?
A	uh yeah for
A	I know they've actually included a list which is quite funny
B	mm
A	seems a bit unnecessary but fine
B	oh it look yeah
A	the internet
B	hm
B	or science or medicine
A	science? Um
B	world problems
A	world problems
B	yeah
A	that's a bit of an issue
B	I don't I couldn't actually tell you what we've talked about so far
A	oh
B	yeah
A	isn't that all we ever talk about?
B	yeah
A	Gok Wan yeah
B	and clothes
A	and and snow
B	that's on the that was on the list I think
A	clothes?
B	yeah
A	oh fashion high fashion
B	uh fashion
A	oh
B	and
A	fashion
B	they don't like that one
B	it's not an approved topic
A	well that
B	yeah
A	that'd be a bit bloody prescriptive
B	yeah
A	mm damage the results somewhat
B	you have to say you have to write down the first words they say
A	huh
B	recording information sheet
A	I have to write down what we say?
B	you the freelancer should complete a copy of this form for each recording you make
A	yeah
B	speakers on tape in order of appearance
A	oh
B	please give the name on their consent form and the first words they say
A	oh
B	shown in the example speaker one Dave Smith so did you go out on Saturday
B	really?
A	yeah
B	where was the recording made?
A	um where is it at my bed
B	how well do the speakers know each other?
B	um
A	my bed
B	yeah
A	but what they do is they listen to it all and then they tell you whether it's a viable
B	this is very interesting
A	viable thing
B	yeah it's fascinating
A	yeah
B	um
A	she I think she likes it
B	the topic of conversation
A	oh
B	advising
A	maybe that's that's to do with how they put it in the corpus
B	requesting
A	announcing
B	anecdote telling
A	oh
B	making arrangements
A	oh
B	buying or selling or telling jokes
A	we're discussing
B	yes
A	whether you can actually get home
B	yeah and complaining a bit
A	and complaining
B	there's quite a lot of that going on
A	quite a lot of complaining at the snow
B	yeah
A	situ
B	um
A	um what am I gonna wear
B	yeah
A	yeah I think well maybe Panther are actually like on the road now cos that would be quite good
B	yeah it would be good yeah
A	you do need that
B	I need to just man up and
A	yeah
B	get out there
A	well we'll taxi this man up
B	yeah
A	that's for damn sure
B	I mean uh I don't really trust the buses if the taxis are kind of unsure
A	no I don't
B	Cos taxis are cars
A	yeah
B	and buses are probably worse than cars for getting around
A	yeah I think they're just more prone to break down
B	yeah
A	as well
B	no really don't
A	at all
