B	yeah
A	claptrap
B	huh
A	what time did this start?
B	er surely it's just
A	five minutes ago
B	yeah
A	but it looks further in
B	you were
A	at school
B	the first time you watched it
A	they showed it to us in in
B	tut
A	it's because I thought the men in the NASA suits were gonna come in through the back door the way that they do with ET
B	oh no
A	and put me in a little incubator
B	oh no
A	the way they do with ET
B	tut
A	Elliott's crying
B	I
A	I can only have been about
B	mm
A	do you think?
B	I thought you were older than that
A	well
A	it was er definitely when we lived in
B	really?
A	yep
B	I can't
A	for a time
B	I I just
A	it was that house
B	mm
A	which means I was maximum seven years old
B	mm
A	which is quite young to show an alien film to surely? I mean I know the little girl in this is quite young
B	mm
A	it is pretty scary
B	er yeah
A	yeah
B	I haven't spoken to them since then so
A	oh you should get
B	I know
B	I know
A	but then that's when it always feels does really um putting pressure on yourself makes it worse
B	yeah
A	no
B	at the moment
A	no
B	mm
A	just see how you go
B	mm
A	no
B	no
A	I knew everyone
B	so everyone felt kind of comfortable I hope
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it was nice to see
B	mm
A	they're all nice
B	did you?
A	a pint after work
B	mm
A	and er actually I when I was cycling down the road I saw
B	oh right
A	cutting through this er I
B	yeah
A	cos
B	is it open now?
A	and it is open now but it was all in a beer tent at the back
B	oh right
A	so
B	yes
A	that's what they're gearing up for
B	yeah
A	so we just wanted to sit out in the sunshine and um
B	mm
A	there was the garden was tiny
B	oh right
A	it was right up that end
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	Cos they're doing all the front up
B	is er are the it's still not finished? Oh
A	no
B	wow
A	but presumably they were aiming to get it finished for Wednesday
B	mm
A	so it would've been really busy
A	if you like that sort of thing
B	yeah
A	have you used your wheelbarrow yet?
B	um not as such
A	mm
B	I know I will
A	I know
B	so it it you know it has been and will be extremely useful
A	Good
B	it will be
A	huh
B	is it coming on?
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	du du du
B	there you go
A	that might be er er when it vibrates I dunno what that means
B	oh
A	I'm trying to turn the vibration thing off
B	hmm
A	stupid thing
B	oh that wasn't her then? I thought it was
A	no
B	oh
A	huh
B	do they?
A	the effects from the first edition
B	yeah
A	versions
B	mm
A	all that sort of carry-on
B	well I would've thought so
A	there's er something quite charming about that
B	oh okay
A	it's it's a puppet again
B	oh okay
A	it's really you know that sort of
B	oh
A	creepy I don't know  I don't know  whether it's just because you've you're used to the puppet and
B	mm
A	now it's not
B	yeah
A	and now they're a bit too I dunno
B	mm
B	no it's fine
A	well if you're sure
B	of course
A	oh thanks
B	no
A	oh
B	Cos you're so good at it now
B	no
B	that's it
A	housemate's birthday was last week
A	er she's quite into her baking
B	oh
A	quite a pro
B	uh
A	and apparently she just turned her down
B	oh no
A	she just ate a bit
B	tut
A	so she brought it in for us to eat
B	huh
A	so had caterpillar cake in the office on Friday
B	mm
B	huh
A	it's ridiculous isn't it
B	that's just ridiculous
A	it's like learning to drive essentially
B	that's just unbelievable
A	I mean I'm sure you know feed and hay is expensive
B	that's just  that's just  crazy
A	thing is buying a horse is is not very expensive
B	mm
A	a horse
B	well I dunno
A	keeping it at the stables
B	yeah
A	vet's bills and saddles and
B	yeah
A	all the rest
B	absolutely
A	and shoes and what have you
B	mm
A	she's just not attractive at all is she
B	no
A	just cos she's er she's
B	er
A	Jerry's daughter isn't she
B	yeah
A	no
B	no
A	mm
B	mm
A	never
B	tut
A	so you don't lose it
B	yeah
A	and that's quite good considering
B	I didn't know that
A	when um tut when
B	mm
A	we came out of the  out of the  house and the next door neighbours had parked across our drive
B	mm
A	even though they go mental if we even
B	yeah
A	park
B	yeah
A	on their side
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	up their path and the car locked itself
B	tut
A	so that's good
B	yeah
A	it's
B	mhm
A	but er I'm so used to pressing unlock when I'm I often press unlock when I mean to press lock when I'm walking away
B	right
A	so it's reassuring to know that if I were to do that and not double-check
B	yeah
A	it will just lock itself
B	exactly
A	which is really good I think for a basic model car
B	absolutely
A	Good old
B	I'm playing Boggle
A	been playing Boggle?
B	mm
A	oh I love Zumba
B	it looks more fun than some things
A	it is really fun
B	well I would've thought so
A	it's such a good work-out
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	so that's quite good
B	mm
A	really
B	mm
A	and it's good
B	mm
A	last week and you know you're all sweaty and my colleague Tim came in and er you're just really embarrassed

B	yes
A	it's cute
B	tut oh

A	and he doesn't have anybody else
B	tut

B	and you know she she'll just get like beans on toast or something
B	so she won't eat properly
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	and if I'm gonna do it then you know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	stare at the wall for a bit
B	no
A	I mean she doesn't really have time I suppose
B	she's er it's just the tiredness
A	mm
B	remember coming home from work and not wanting to do it so
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's why batch cooking is so good when you do live alone
B	mm
A	er cook a load up and then so that's one night where you're cooking but then the next couple of nights
B	mm
A	you're not so

B	tut
A	yeah I had just basically gone and stop
B	oh no
A	but at that time you know quarter to eight it's not busy so I just reversed it back

A	plus this is the first time she's moved home since she finished

A	it was a huge block of cheese
A	and dogs really like cheese don't they
B	do they?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	Penny loved cheese
B	actually I think they do
A	mm
B	well
A	indeed
B	you're not supposed to
B	I don't think it's very good for them but
B	oh dear
B	mm
A	Cos they're alive when you dissect them?
B	no
A	well he said that's chloroform
B	oh
A	unless that does kill frogs because it's
B	maybe
A	powerful?
B	absolutely
A	and they're putting the lids on
B	yeah
A	so maybe it does kill them
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna sneeze
B	oh bless you
A	it's always lurking
A	that was bloody terrfying
B	tut
A	well I wasn't expecting

A	it to
B	it just made you jump that's all
A	I remember you screaming like a
B	yeah
B	I would've thought so
A	you would think so
B	I would think so
A	I mean if Kerry's kept them in the shop this long
A	well she told me the other day
B	I'd be surprised
A	but
B	yeah
A	left
B	I
A	start making noises
B	yeah
A	and you can start you now
B	mm

A	look at his little bottom
B	why don't you try phoning her? See if she's
A	well I'm sure she would text me if she was was finished
B	it's strange that she hasn't been in touch
A	well that's what makes me think that um
B	that is weird
A	she's still working
B	yeah
B	it is
A	a ridiculous day
B	it is
A	without them having
B	absolutely
A	to do an extra hour
B	mm
A	huh
B	really?
A	oh this this is probably an advert for Tesco's

A	yeah
B	pretty awful
A	it's that sort of deliberately messy
B	mm
A	controlled messy
B	hmm
A	pretty hilarious
B	that's strange that she's not answering at all
A	well it makes me
B	mm
A	and the thing is because I can't pull up
B	no
A	get out and see if she's in the shop and see what's going on
B	well if you  if you  want to get on do
A	which is a shame
B	I know
A	and I just don't want it to rain on her
B	and it's really nice of you to think that
A	well I'll leave it until seven
B	really?
A	er cos I wanna go and have dinner and stuff so
B	well of course you do
B	as I say you're welcome to stay darling
A	I know
