A	yeah
C	and I've still got them to wear at home
B	is
A	and it's brand names
B	oh
C	yeah as well when they have like a sale and like we just
C	yeah
A	probably last year's design or whatever do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
C	but the people who were saying it probably like go for like fashionable stuff so it's probably why they don't like it
A	straight on
B	yeah it's a bit hit and miss sometimes it doesn't it just goes off funny and sometimes you just think where is it taking us? and
C	and when it starts spinning
B	yeah I very rarely use it I think it needs updating but I can't find the er
A	the leads?
B	the things I need to yeah the leads and
C	you've had it for years
B	I know I I don't use it often it's just handy occasionally for somewhere earlier in the

B	well
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh yeah yeah the Google Maps thing's quite good it's not bad
B	yeah it seems to be right
C	mm
C	yeah just with a few detours
B	yeah
A	I thought it would tell you straight
B	yeah well
B	must have got my bearings wrong
A	I thought it was straight we don't wanna go into town oh yeah
A	oh I know because it lets you miss that big busy road there with the fastest route
B	yeah there's two
A	oh you've just gotta turn round so
B	oh it's turning right here is it?
A	yeah
B	oh
B	so yeah I mean that's not a great deal to knock off the house fourteen hundred especially at that sort of
A	well I asked for two thousand
B	oh right I thought you said it was only fourteen hundred
A	well no because it was the tax wasn't included so I added that that was a hundred and thirty-nine each
B	yeah
A	and then
B	but it's still it's not though it's not a massive amount so it should
A	it's not no
B	you know they wanna sell it
A	yeah
B	and then even if they said no and you might back out and then they'd have to wait months again and then the next seller might say the same thing and so I can't see them saying we're not doing it
A	somebody else can bring yeah
B	I mean if they might do we could say look we've we've got it priced for
A	yeah
B	a low price already and
A	but I spoke to the erm the people who did the survey you know the one I paid for?
B	yeah
A	and they said no it's not as erm as not as serious as
B	not
A	I mean they would put you know the language probably
B	over time needs to
A	yeah
B	be done but it's not immediate
A	yeah and used but
A	yeah
B	yeah they can't
A	in case something happens
B	yeah
A	but then when I emailed them I clearly said no no it's not that you know urgent

C	yeah because
B	so they're not all they can't
C	because
B	some places
C	because the cinema's like

A	oh that's a long walk from there
B	yeah that river that's what leads to the er
C	I don't even know if you can walk along all that way
C	oh

B	it's an early one
B	yeah
A	so we used to go there yeah they joined with the learning centre cos the toys are all theirs they must have merged or something
A	I remember feeling like this with
B	well
C	what do you want from here?

A	I know
C	yellow
A	I need one because I've got
B	have you still got your teddy blanket?
C	yeah

C	give it up it's in my wardrobe or somewhere no I think it's in the attic actually
A	must have
C	oh oh
B	yeah one says what?
B	well they're both cellular cellular
C	so get an extra soft one
B	yeah
A	no I think this one seems thicker to me see?
B	well that's what I thought yeah
A	yeah
B	that that seems that seems better
C	just get cellular then
B	this reason that seems thicker is this is softer that's why it seems thinner
A	yeah no I don't want that
B	I would have thought you'd want the softer one though
A	no cos erm if you wash it it'll go thingy
B	mm
A	yeah oh yeah
C	get this elephant door stopper
C	cos you
B	my doors keep opening and closing
B	yeah I put
C	I know but
B	that was
B	when you come to live with me you can bring your door stopper
C	why? when am I living with you?
B	why are you pulling a face?
B	you don't even come and visit me never mind live with me
B	mm
C	why?
B	I don't know
A	I don't think they used to have this extra soft one when
C	that's weird
A	oh that's nice
C	yep I want one of them can I have one?
B	you'll have to get a doorstop of that
C	and a frame
B	yeah
C	is that a cushion?
B	I don't know what is it?
B	why do babies need a cushion?
C	it's decoration
B	oh right
C	bookend yeah
C	bookends apple and pear
A	I think she had two didn't she? didn't need more than that can't remember why but the said to use these with newborns I think so she won't slip underneath it
B	mm
A	and I think they said two layers I can't remember it's been ages ago I can't remember anything about
B	mm
C	I
A	I had a good
B	well your mum must have told you did she?
A	no she didn't she didn't know anything
B	well the midwife told you
A	must have been yeah
B	well you'll get that advice again when you're in hospital just ask them
A	mm
B	and
C	yeah I can look it up cos I don't know anything but
B	oh are you not getting one of those steamers for the bottle?
A	got one already my dad got me one
B	oh that's good that's a good price that one thirty odd
A	thirty-four look at the legs
B	well you these are different to that one aren't they? these are raised higher aren't they?
A	yes
B	that other one's a lot more simple
B	mm she used to like that
A	oh yeah
B	she lie and erm push and pull them yeah
A	good pictures we sent off to a magazine
C	really?
A	yeah
C	did I get put in it?
A	yeah
C	wow
B	I don't remember that
A	that mother and baby magazine and we got those erm Mothercare vouchers yeah
A	they put her in
B	see what a lovely baby you were
A	I think it was in that
B	oh yeah I remember
A	yeah in that picture
C	well you wanted the blankets do you want anything else?
A	no no
C	the blankets
C	oh yeah we should have got all our stuff in there and to help save the jungle
A	yeah it's in
C	do our bit for the environment
B	right
C	ah that's cute
B	oh you can do like a
C	well your fingerprint doesn't change does it throughout your life?
B	yeah I know but it's the size isn't it?
C	I know but the print's the same
B	well it's not you can't see the print can you?
C	oh
B	it's just the the imprint I guess I think that's what it is is it?
C	yeah
B	looks like that doesn't it? I can't see
C	but I mean it's pretty useless unless you lose your finger in later life
B	no it's the size your finger grows you'll never have another finger that size again will you?
C	well
B	no that'll be the big finger there won't it? so
C	oh right
B	don't tell me your finger's the same as when you were a baby?
C	well no but it's the same finger
B	alright well that's you look at it and think oh I remember if it's that small you'll think
C	oh
B	and you get all nostalgic
C	oh do you?
B	look at them
C	they're weird
B	they they do a cast of the feet
B	I think
C	mm
B	probably
C	yeah
B	so
B	or it might be like that dunno if it's in ceramic
C	it's a bit ominous isn't it?
B	what?
C	kind of like a a human sculpture like trapped in time
B	well the world is full of human sculptures isn't it?
C	it's a bit odd isn't it?
B	right
C	it's a bit sinister I think it's like
B	really
C	yeah
B	what cos you imagine the hands coming to strangle you
B	actually there's a good old er horror film called the hand and the hand by itself
C	well there you go then
B	yeah a hand like that it's really good
C	I don't know
B	mm
C	ah is this for me?
B	you've got some warm blankets now
C	yeah
A	I just need to go to the toilet anybody else need to go?
B	there's some here look
C	do you need to go again?
B	no I don't need to go time and time in the day I'm not having a baby
C	well you you you need to go a lot
B	I went once cos I had a long journey
B	and I might now go a second time later I don't know
B	do you want me to let you know when the time comes?
B	your bladder
C	yeah
B	and I have been drinking a lot of water
C	ah
B	and that's to do with it as well
C	yeah I know yeah
B	if your bladder's full you have muscles that tighten and tell you you've got to go it's full
C	yeah yeah
B	and then you will
B	it's how it works saw it on telly the other day
C	oh did you?
B	so
C	yeah so I don't drink that much water when I'm at school because it's not I I don't have time to go
B	oh why not?
C	because I've got lessons
B	yeah surely you can hold it for a lesson somehow
C	yeah no but then you don't have time to like
B	what you?
C	yeah no it's not our lessons are an hour and a half and then you don't have time to go between lessons cos you've got another lesson
B	you have time to go surely they give time to walk to the other classroom?
C	no it's the lesson starts
B	in the same classroom?
C	no the lesson starts as soon as the other one finishes
B	mm
C	so you have to like run otherwise you're late
B	I didn't wouldn't have thought you were allowed to run in the corridors
B	why don't you buy some rollerblades?
B	or a skateboard
C	it's stupid because the teachers usually give you an allowance like a couple of minutes like while you walk to the next block or something but one of my friends has a teacher who's like if you're even like thirty seconds late she's like why are you late?
B	you say well there's no such thing as teleportation yet they have it on Star Trek but it's not existed I can't
B	teleport from the last classroom I've
C	so yeah and she thought it's really unfair and then
B	yeah
C	the thing is that teacher always keeps them in late so then she's late to her next lesson but the other teachers are like understanding but it's funny that this teacher who doesn't want you to come at all late keeps them in longer
B	yeah but if you say well I finished my other lesson
C	yeah yeah
B	at the same time this one starts speak to the head teacher
C	yeah
B	ah
C	er because you're oblivious ah
B	I'm oblivious?
C	no as a child you just
B	oh right
C	and you're ignorant to everything and you're just like
C	and you're just like a bumbling fool and it's like who wants to be in that state forever?
B	is that what you thought of yourself? a bumbling fool?
C	that's what all children are
B	yeah but that foolishness and ignorance is bliss
C	I'd rather know
B	most people would like to go back to that
C	I'd rather know and keep my knowledge and keep my knowledge and everything than and be miserable in my knowledge
B	well what's that to do with wearing a pretty dress?
C	no because you were saying why don't you go back to being like that? as a young person but I like age I think it's good
B	do you?
C	yeah
B	can you not wait till you're a hundred?
B	you should enjoy your youth as well
C	well I I'm old now it's too late
B	you're
B	this is the best time of your life that starts now
C	why is it the best time of my life?
B	because you're still young but you should have a bit of freedom to make your own decisions
C	yeah but right I I I've had this discussion with you before and yeah and you're like oh you get freedom
B	yeah
C	and I'm like well I
B	yeah but you came in and said oh when you were fifteen I'm off tomorrow on a flight to the other side of the world
C	yeah but I don't want to
B	well
C	a bit before you
B	right where to now? are you heading back home?
A	yeah and then
C	yeah
B	mm we're only just
C	are we?
B	yeah we're
C	oh right
B	I don't know
A	you need the sat nav?
B	well do you know the way to disable it? I I think I
A	yeah
B	it's right I think isn't it?
A	yeah
C	I thought that this time in the morning was our conversation time and then we go and have food rather than having food and then having conversation time afterwards do you know what I?
B	are you that hungry you have to shove it down your
C	well no
B	yeah
C	so like this is our kind of talk time and then we're gonna go and eat and then that's how it's worked
B	oh well
C	so you've not really like lost anything
A	and she come by my shopping trip as well
C	yeah like this was the whole idea
B	so left here
A	mm
B	see that sign? that
A	it is this way yeah I know where we are I think I do
C	in fact
B	yeah I think it's just a straight
C	it's probably worked out better for you because usually we wouldn't be able to talk we'd be sat in the cinema and you'd also have to pay for the cinema
B	oh yeah
C	well I I won't now because it's far past lunchtime now and I I was erm anticipating to be having lunch around now so
C	no I don't think I don't think we'll be able to
B	right
C	unfortunately
B	what's your schedule?
B	well have you got plans things planned in? like a
C	well I should probably do some more revision
B	oh
C	we'll do then the matter of
B	would this would this route not be a quicker way? is this a road that you
A	yeah it's not it's not this bit it's when you get to
B	oh right yeah
A	erm so it's not as busy to go on a motorway and go in the where I used to live
B	yeah
B	what were you saying
C	erm
B	yeah well I said to you just see how the day goes do what you wanna do
C	I mean the plan will be to go home and do my revision but I might just go to sleep
B	you may as well go to the cinema as go home to sleep
C	but I don't know like it's the intention that matters really isn't it?
B	er there's a couple of new films out did you look them up
C	no because you read you read me the synopsis
C	Tomorrow Land
B	Tomorrow Land is it?
C	yeah
B	erm George Clooney's in that based on
C	yeah I mean that one sounds quite good but it's over two hours
B	yeah there's another one about er an earthquake in California San Andreas
C	have you seen that erm? I just saw it the other day on the internet in India they do a seven D experience
C	I don't know
B	do they come around and slap you on the face
C	no I don't know why they've called it seven D but wow it's like I watched
C	it's like you stand in the middle of a room
B	yeah
C	and they've got like animals that walk around you but they're not real animals but they look so real and they're like projections but
B	oh do they have these things like
C	no no but they no cos they're just these people stood in the middle of the room and erm there's these animals walking past them and then there's like a dolphin that swims through the floor and it's obviously not there but it looks so real if you look it up it's in India Dubai or somewhere they do it
B	Dubai?
C	yeah
B	that's not India
C	where's Dubai?
B	Dubai is erm
A	Arab
B	it's an Arabic
C	well it cos there was one it says it said Dubai but then when I looked it up it said er theatre of India or something so maybe they do it in India as well
B	maybe that's what it maybe it's like
C	oh maybe yeah
B	it does sound like something more Dubai than India cos it's Dubai's quite modern
C	well yeah I
B	oh so it's probably like your
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	have you
C	yeah
C	the the good ones are you know like where it's made for 3D
B	and
C	and it's like a 3D experience like when we saw that dinosaur thing and like when I went with school we watched
B	yeah
C	that was good but then when you
B	so do you remember that one we went to in the space centre?
C	the oh the planet one? where you like lie back?
B	yeah
C	yeah that was good yeah
B	I dunno what they call that?
C	like those ones are good but then when you just go and see like a film on the 3D it's not like 3D is it?
B	no well it is you can see it has more depth
C	well yeah no but it's not like it's 3D 3D
C	yeah
B	so we're not going today then?
C	I don't think so
A	well that's to
B	I bet your mum's looking forward to coming over?
A	yeah
B	it's been a while I bet since you've seen them is it?
A	erm
B	a few years is it since
C	was it was it years?
A	last did she come last year?
C	has she actually? I cos she didn't go to the no she didn't go to the oh she helped us move to
A	so two years yeah?
C	yeah
B	two years ago
A	doesn't seem like it cos she's always on Skype
C	I know yeah
B	actually your mum was the one that was
C	yeah now and now he's been over for a lot
B	yeah
C	but yeah we talk to her so often it's just like it's like she's never left
B	yeah so
B	Skype is good isn't it?
A	yeah
C	but yeah she's been looking forward to coming over for like the past I don't know like she's had her case packed for months
C	she just keeps buying stuff and it's like we don't need that
A	excited isn't she? never could
C	yeah
B	is your brother just
A	yeah
C	yeah it'll give her something to do I think she gets bored
B	yeah she'll she'll be kept busy
C	it'll give her some purpose back in her life
B	well that's the thing when you retire isn't it? it
A	yeah
C	I could think of plenty of ways to fill my retired life
C	well I mean hopefully I'll be able to get a really enjoyable job so that I won't want to retire but if my job's boring then I'm going to be looking forward to my retirement as soon as that starts
B	you don't have to stick with one job for the rest of your life do you?
C	I know but they might all be boring I don't know I might like working
C	yeah I do I well I like I like learning but I don't like the system I feel it's very restrictive I want to do my own learning
B	well it's a bit more like that at university
C	yeah maybe I'll just well I'll maybe I'll do a PhD and then I'll be like a a professor
B	yeah
C	and do research I don't know cos to be a professor you have to teach others and I don't know whether I want to do that I don't really want to teach others
B	well you just have to I suppose if you're not sure what you do wanna do just try to get your best marks and your studies and then take it from there
C	I'd like to have PhDs away when either way though
B	why? so we all have to call you professor?
C	well well you can't you can't be professor unless you teach but I will be doctor
B	why would you like to have a PhD? just so you you know
C	well because I don't like it just seems like good because you can just er do it for a year on whatever you want erm
B	and can you do that while you're working?
C	erm yeah you can do it part time yeah
B	mm
C	you don't get a loan for a
B	really?
C	mm mm
B	like what what's that seven thousand a year?
C	no it's probably nine thousand again
B	is it just would you just how many years would you study for it? just like an extra year?
C	yeah masters is
B	so it's quite it's pretty expensive to
C	yeah
B	if I've got to already have a good job
C	yeah
B	well there was something in the paper a while back I don't know if I told you there was just a bloke who who wanted to do his masters and er be accepted and to a point they realised he didn't have any money in the bank said well how are you gonna afford to to live? I think he could pay for the
A	yeah
B	but they said to do this course you need we expect you to have this much money in the bank so
C	yeah
B	and he had some money said oh that's not enough and cos he
C	oh right
B	and I think he
C	what?
B	it seems ridiculous that it's not really any of their business
C	yeah that's weird
B	yeah
C	yeah I know that like some places encourage you like I know at
B	mm
C	er just to focus on your your studying and stuff but I'd say that most universities are like oh it's okay to work and study at the same time
B	yeah I think so many students do they have to
C	no I know I'm going now cos I'm unconditional
B	right but
C	yeah I've had it
B	oh right right so can you not are you not gonna start so sorting out your accommodation now?
C	well it they they do it all at the same time it'll be in June it opens and then you apply for it
B	well well how can the other students who haven't had the offer?
C	they can't apply for it yet either
B	no how can they do it in June?
C	oh well they apply for the accommodation
B	yeah
C	erm because by making it your firm it's like the assumption that yes you're going to get the grades you're gonna go there
B	what so you can still
C	yeah like so everybody you you you treat it as though yes you are going there like you expect to get those results
C	erm
B	yep
C	yeah
B	but then if everybody
C	but then
B	they won't have any places
C	yeah I I don't know how they do it because there'll be people who've got it as like their insurance so like the second choice so then if they fall through from their first university they'll go to
B	yeah
C	yeah they sort they sort out the places and everything but like the university does the accommodation and they guarantee you accommodation
B	for the first year
C	for the first year if you're if it's your firm choice so
B	so you decided on what you want yet?
C	erm yeah I I'm I probably want I want my own bathroom
B	yeah
C	because
B	but are you gonna have a shared kitchen?
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	where are we going here?
A	straight on
B	it says straight on to
B	so you're not gonna have you your own erm completely private place?
C	no but I'll have my own bathroom
B	and how much is that a year?
C	well it it actually varies like depending on which one you get
C	cos you'll apply for it and it's like within a range
B	mm
C	erm and it could be more or less
B	oh right
C	because you have to put your two options in I think
B	mm
B	do you?
C	yeah so you have to say this is my first choice
B	oh right
C	but if that's not available this is my second choice but they have quite a lot of en suites so I can't see why I wouldn't get an en suite the one I asked for
B	er did you hear about those
C	oh I saw that on the er on the internet
C	yeah
C	well wasn't it like they were like mixed with something? and then they got
B	well well no it it well I didn't I didn't read I only caught a
C	oh right
C	I think whatever they took was mixed with something what I don't know
B	oh right well that's the point these legal these legal highs they call them cos it says on the packaging so they can get around the law
C	yeah
B	not for human consumption
C	oh right
B	that cos of the stuff they've got in them and it's all you know there's a hundred odd people died in this country taking them
C	yeah
B	so the government are trying to find a way to stop it legally but they
C	oh yeah
C	yeah
B	erm
C	well yeah no yeah put anything in them put cyanide in them
B	well probably with that it's
B	well you never know yeah you're buying from these
C	and if says do not eat and then they'll be like oh look this person's died they had cyanide were they poisoned? oh well it said do not eat and they ate it
B	well I've I've heard some of them have plant growing or something
C	yeah
B	it's the same
C	no
B	so you need to be careful when you're at university you'll be coming across people that might be trying to encourage you to try this stuff you know
B	no I'm only saying it because
C	if I don't even drink if I don't even drink
B	well I know you won't but you may be in a situation where you think oh well you know I might give it a go or something
B	cos you cos maybe other people are encouraging you
C	ah
B	it's worth talking about it because you never know do you? well this takes into
A	no
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and on top of that there'll be people that are having illegal drugs as well and saying oh try this
C	oh yeah
B	no I'm just saying you wouldn't
B	well you know it's silly to do stuff like that isn't it? but
C	it's silly it's life ruining you might as well have you might as well die than take drugs
B	well you know I thought you'd have that opinion and I can't see you doing it but you know I'm just saying that we'll cross that
C	in
B	well that's the
C	I know yeah
B	and with you saying you don't drink in lessons if you're doing exams or your lessons and that you make sure you're well hydrated beforehand
B	well you know because doesn't affect you
C	well I take water into the exam with me
B	you're not I know you drink a lot of water anyway so you want to be well hydrated because you can get headaches if you're dehydrated
C	cos I don't drink anything else
B	you are I think you must be very well hydrated
C	cos other people have like juice and tea and coffee but I don't like that so I just I just drink water
C	because like juice and stuff doesn't actually really hydrate you
B	I can't believe May has turned into
A	I can't wait to leave
B	well I know you don't like it but I know you don't have a lot of choice as well

B	mm
A	I don't know if they erm must have updated it
B	you do see them advertising like exhibitions
A	I never liked
B	mm
B	I didn't think people were like that here
A	they are
B	they're a bit stuck up then
A	narrow minded as well cos some of them don't go anywhere which means some of them some of er
B	well I can understand you'd get like that
A	well I can't understand it
B	because it's very insular and you just stay in here
