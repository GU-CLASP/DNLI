A	so why are they making all these cuts?
B	it don't make sense do it?
A	no
B	and yet they're advertising for more teachers
A	yeah and it's a lie what's on the on there
B	yeah
A	total lie
C	mm
A	about the amount of money you get
B	what did they put? er
A	twenty-five K I think it said
B	twenty-five K to start off with
B	it's about fifteen ain't it?
A	nineteen
B	nineteen is it?
C	is it? mm
B	well he could work them out
C	I missed the whole
B	yeah
A	I had my meeting with the head
B	mm
A	and she said
A	erm
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	so
B	yeah
A	would my salary still stay the same? and she went yes erm they've extended my contract as head of year seven till the thirty-first of July
B	so that's good ain't it?
C	yeah right
C	mm
A	I could cut my mortgage by half
C	oh half? wow
B	that's a lot ain't it?
C	that would be good wouldn't it?
A	I could cut my mortgage by half
C	wow
A	I wouldn't have
B	yeah
A	because I've got things paid off
C	ah right
B	yeah
C	so you might not have to sell now?
A	then I might not have to sell
C	would you leave it to sell? or?
A	no I'd take it off the market
C	you'd take it off mm
A	and then I'd do some jobs I'd take it off the market and then do some jobs
B	yeah
B	you can yeah that's true
A	you know you know and then
A	go for a smaller property
C	mm
B	yeah
A	so I haven't wasted all that lump sum as such
B	mm
A	I could I could
B	would you rent? or buy?
A	erm in three years time or in two years time I'd buy
B	yeah
C	oh that's a much better idea
A	yeah
B	cos I could sell
C	yeah
A	er rent until I've found somewhere and if I move
B	yeah
A	could do something like that
C	mm
B	well things are looking up then
C	oh that's good
A	so it's just a thought it's just a thought I've
C	yeah
B	well that's well you've got you've got
C	mm it'd be nice to have that
A	yeah if I was to be fortunate to get the head of school job
B	yeah
A	if I got the head of school job because that is a big salary increase
C	oh right
A	so
B	that'd be good won't it?
C	mm
A	and then it'd just be a case of just juggling certain things and
B	mm yeah and not buying new cameras and stuff
B	or computers or
A	I haven't bought anything have I?
B	no or going to Rome or anything like that
A	I can't I haven't got a passport
B	what? has it run out?
B	so has mine
A	I can't leave the country so I can't do anything like that
B	you could go to Scotland
A	I could I do need to get my passport though cos just in case I wanna do something but
B	I still have to get one too
C	why?
B	I don't know cos I don't
C	wait till we decide something then you get it
B	yeah but it takes so long to come through don't it?
A	yeah well it's ten years so I'd get it just in case
B	yeah
A	so so that's what I'm that's what I'm thinking at the moment
C	mm
A	that's what I'm thinking
C	well that's some stress took off isn't it? that you've got that to fall back on
A	nah well it is it is er it is some
C	yeah
B	yes
A	but I don't I still got I've gotta make that decision I've gotta do the
C	mm
B	yes you have yeah you gotta take
C	what if they in the meantime someone said I want to buy your house?
A	I'd sell it
C	mm?
A	I'd sell it
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah and carry on as you were
A	yeah
C	mm
B	well the buying season is now coming up again so
A	I'd sell it I'd sell it
C	mm
B	might've been only three hundred thousand weren't it?
C	that'd make it even better wouldn't it? for you if you
A	yeah
C	mm
B	quite a bit
C	yeah
B	what's that what's that on
A	two seven to two nine at the moment
B	is it? yeah
A	well if I did those jobs I mean if I did the jobs and painted it and
B	yeah you want someone like Phil Spencer to come in and tell you
A	yeah yeah and declutter and have a big declutter
B	yeah
B	well if we er if we ever decide I mean to declutter this place'd well that that'd fill up it'd fill up skips galore wouldn't it?
C	oh it's terrible isn't it really? yeah
B	I mean you think what you
C	I mean we started painting in here in the dairy because
B	yeah
C	all the you know the top
A	yeah

B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and when
B	well you bump into a lot of people now don't you?

B	are they?
C	mm
B	well that's their loss at the end of it ain't it?
A	you know and that and that is also having a thing on my mind
B	yeah
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	it's well it's right it's right through the school
B	is it? oh crikey
A	it's right through the school it's
B	you haven't got good intake lately then
B	yeah?
A	since Christmas
B	well
C	mm
A	and you
B	no
C	yeah
A	there is no sanctions
B	well if you can't sanction
A	you know if the
B	no there ain't no
A	you need a you need a system that is
B	you do don't you? yeah
A	so
C	mm
B	is that what they do?
A	yeah I'm not going to that lesson
B	well they're barmy aren't they?
A	you know we had a had a Tuesday night we had a meeting with the chief executive on Tuesday night
B	yeah?
A	he'd come to do his roadshow
A	and he starts off
B	yeah
A	two hundred and eighty students coming in
B	no
A	you know we're the academy's built for er a hundred and eleven they're predicting in ten years' time there'll be a
C	mm
A	for that type of thing
B	oh
A	we can't expand because you are holding us back because your
B	do you know that but in
C	mm
B	in just about every every place you get an idiot like that coming in don't you? how much do they get paid?
A	you know and you're thinking
C	mm mm
A	okay you earn something like a hundred and sixty a hundred and eighty grand a year
B	get rid of you yeah
A	let's take a drop in your salary to a hundred grand
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	add to
B	yeah
A	right? and you're thinking yeah okay and he and he came back to it a
C	mm
A	not that thank you very much for all the hard work you're doing and we know you're trying hard and we know things are difficult with some of the students here
C	yeah
A	you know and here we are
B	yeah
A	and he's turning up and saying that
B	but I mean
C	you need boosting up don't you? to to get the motivation and things like that
A	you know
C	you know
B	but when you get people
B	good teachers at risk of redundancy then any school or academy if they got rid of the good them teachers how are they going to build it?
A	yeah
B	how are they going to build round anything?
A	yeah
B	you cannot build a school up from something that you've lost er that's gone
A	yeah
B	you gotta have
A	yeah cheaper cheaper
C	mm
A	because you can balance your books or whatever
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and it it doesn't work like that
B	no
A	because what happens is it costs you more at the end of the day because you employ people to come in because those people go off on stress
B	yeah
A	the youngsters go
B	no
C	yeah
A	we've got one member of staff at this moment in time who I reckon must have a day off a week at the moment
C	yeah
B	what? cos of stress?
A	just not very well
B	yeah
A	and if you look at it it
C	oh dear
A	mm I if I'm noticing that
C	yeah
A	pattern and I don't have that job to do any more
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know cos that's one of the jobs that I used to do was
B	yeah
A	you look down it and you think mm yeah okay
C	mm
B	there's too many people
C	mm
A	so you kind of think oh well
B	yeah
A	expanding
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know and what I book I booked something in the diary
B	yeah
A	why do we need to move it? because we've got mock exams that week in that room so can we put it in the atrium?
B	oh
A	I've booked it well in advance
B	yes
A	we've got an outside speaker coming in
C	yeah
B	that's bad ain't it?
C	mm
B	so they can override everything you do anyway?
A	you know and you think well okay why why organise something?
B	why organise anything? yeah
A	you know
C	yeah
A	I've gotta organise something for the twenty-second of April
B	mm
A	so
C	mm
B	that's that's er the right hand not letting the left hand know what they're doing
A	yeah and when you and when you do do everything by the book that you're supposed to do it gets overridden
B	yeah
A	and you think well hold on you decided to put another mock exam in in a couple of weeks time
B	yeah
A	you know we don't need mock exams now what we need is kids in the room with us going through the stuff
B	yeah yeah
A	not taking a
B	of course you have yeah yeah
C	mm
A	you know we had to do we had to do last week there was a deadline to put some grades in
B	oh right
A	but then we find the grades that we'd put in last week they'd all been deleted because not every department had done it and it's like duplicating your work
B	yeah
C	mm
B	why did they do it though? why?
A	oh it's the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	well they're not cutting the funding to education they're not cutting the funding to
A	what they're not telling you is there are more students coming in
B	yeah
A	right?
B	yeah
A	pension contributions have gone up
B	have they?
A	right? all those come out of your pot of money because as an employer you have to put
B	yeah
A	money into your pensions and all of this business
B	yeah yeah
A	and that so if you got more
B	well of course it does yeah yeah
A	you know
B	that's a bit stupid it well I mean when
A	yeah
B	facts and figures are so manipulated
A	well they can manipulate it how they want to
B	however they want to do it they can manipulate it
A	mm
B	ah yes but we did this for this group here but they took it away from that group there
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	so
B	and people believe it that's the trouble they I mean whatever they hear or
A	yeah
B	if if the prime minister says something oh yeah that's great but he said it in such a a round about way that there's loads of interpretations you can put on it
A	yeah you know depending on which newspaper you'll read will depend on what it means
B	yeah yeah that's true yeah
C	yeah
A	you know we know that from you know
B	yeah
A	and newspapers change their allegiances
B	they do don't they?
C	mm yeah
A	so
B	was it The Sun that used to be really Tory weren't it at one time?
A	yeah at one point it was really Tory
B	that was wasn't it?
A	Daily Mail is really Tory
B	that that's really Tory what's The Telegraph? that's a bit
A	that that's a bit left wing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	The Telegraph
B	it was The Daily Mirror that used to be
A	that used to be Labour
B	Labour through and through that used to have a slogan on the top forward with the people
A	yeah
B	that was their slogan
C	mm
B	is that still about that paper? the Daily Mirror
A	yeah the Daily Mirror's still about
B	is it?
C	mm mm
A	thing
C	mm
A	but then
C	they turn it round yeah
A	turn his situation around
B	yeah
A	from the point of view well
C	mm
A	you've got a house that you've got a nanny and all the other bits and pieces
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	well
B	yeah
A	he he believes in it for everybody else he's working
B	yeah
A	and he's employing people
B	yeah
A	so dunno it could be an interesting election in a month's time
C	mm
B	well it will be but when when they er
C	mm
B	and then you get the opposition come on
A	yeah
B	they cannot agree one little item
A	yeah
B	and they make everybody look bad
A	yeah the thing at the moment is this thirty billion that they're gonna cut from the health budget that that
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	thirty billion they're gonna cut from the health budget
C	wow
B	who's going to get the thirty billion then?
A	they're just gonna cut it
B	yeah but that thirty billion has got to be saved
C	it goes somewhere else doesn't it?
B	somewhere else
A	no
C	mm
A	because if you if you like if you're gonna cut it you don't have to spend thirty billion do you?
C	oh I see
B	no that's true no
C	yeah
B	but they got thirty billion that they could spend on something else
C	saved
A	yeah but well they take that off the deficit then don't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	so if your deficit is whatever it is
B	yeah they gotta get the deficit down
C	mm
A	get the deficit down
C	mm
A	cos you get the deficit down
A	by not paying what you need to be paying
C	mm
B	the deficit has been coming down since er the year two thousand that was one trillion pound in the year two thousand I remember that happening
B	and er I don't know what it is now but every month that that used to be er on the goods sold and the goods imported didn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	they used to have the import export balance didn't they?
B	is it? yeah
A	but
B	yeah petrol's gone up again ain't it? yeah
A	cos it was one 0 four a litre
B	yeah
A	that's the cheapest that I put in or one 0 five cos that was
B	yeah
B	point nine ain't it? yeah
A	it's now one eleven
B	is it? yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's
B	yeah
A	back up?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	we hadn't heard about that had we?
B	no
C	knew it had come down but
A	you know
C	mm
A	it was one 0
B	did they put extra on the on the petrol?
A	no
A	no
B	they stopped it for yonks didn't they?
A	they still
B	yeah
A	the duty the thing is they've taken
B	well that's nothing is it you know compared with what people drink I mean they're not gonna sit people who are drinking don't save anything do they? what's a penny?
C	mm
B	that might work out to quite a few million in in the
A	across the whole
C	yeah but they could take off five pence and no one'd make any difference really
A	no
C	so
B	or they could put it on and earn more money
A	yeah
C	but that's what I
B	yeah
A	they could put it on
A	and it'd be worth more
B	well I mean
A	but yeah you know why why's he why's he done that? he's done that because he wants to get
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	mm
A	and our and our cider and our spirits
B	yeah
A	no
B	as though the working class are smoking and drinking like hell
C	mm
A	more drinking is probably done with the
B	with the posh
A	with the posh yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I was I
B	oh yeah they're funny
A	you know they're always drinking
B	yeah they've got their wine haven't they? yeah
A	they've got their wine
C	yeah
A	they're always try something different
B	yeah
A	and they said something the other day and I just thought
B	yeah
C	mm
A	with what you you do
B	yeah yeah they are ain't they?
A	so
B	yeah
B	no
A	yeah it's just
B	they never change that's you remember that Yes Minister?
C	mm
B	and Maggie Thatcher said that was
A	it was quite close
B	just how it is
A	yeah
B	where you go in and the the minister says oh we're going to do this and the oh no you can't do that minister you cannot do that
A	yeah
A	it's it's funny because they manipulate it for each party
B	they do yeah
C	yeah
A	and you're thinking well where is the balance?
C	yeah
B	there's no balance there is there?
A	there's no balance there if you you know you're gonna make one party look good when they're in and one party look bad when they're in because of what you
B	yeah
A	you do
B	because of the civil servants I mean the civil servants never change that's really weird that is you know
C	yeah
A	you don't have you don't have a a
B	no you don't
A	so you don't say oh change of election all these are coming out now and then all
B	no they're all getting the
A	these come out and this group go in type thing
B	and we're this yeah
A	no they just
C	mm
B	we'll they're all the same
A	yeah
B	and they're the ones that that have gotta be pulled to to the book because they're the ones that are manipulating the MPs
A	yeah
B	well there are but they I mean
A	you know I can't see the likes of Osborne and Ed Balls sitting down with a calculator saying right we're gonna spend this amount on this and that amount on that
C	no
B	no
A	can you? you know it'd be good to be a fly on the wall on what they actually do
B	oh yeah yeah well they're all advised by different groups of
C	mm
A	yeah
A	yeah they've all got their their little quangos which they've tried to cut and whatever
B	yeah
A	so
C	mm
B	and that's lovely cos what happens is er if they put their name to something these MPs they get a little bit of extra money too
A	yeah
B	you know if if if for instance er I had I was an MP and er someone like Typhoo Tea came up and said er do you mind putting your name to this? you know
A	yeah
B	and that's it
A	they have to declare it as well don't they?
B	they declare it yeah they have to declare it
A	that UKIP minister's been done this week hasn't she?
C	mm
A	inflate my bill because we just want some of our money back what a stupid
B	that was er that was for fifteen thousand quid weren't it?
A	I don't know how much it
C	mm
A	so she's been suspended
B	you see that's what happen when they get in they think they can do anything and make themself I mean they think they can have two houses to to er claim for and
C	they need two houses
B	and a
B	they think they can do all this sort of business
A	but the thing is if that's what this is what
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	that's right yeah
A	you know if it was the case that you you know because you're an MP and you need to live in London so often
B	that's right
A	because you need to be here at certain times
B	that that's it yeah
A	then why then why moan?
B	yeah
A	why moan about it? alright if it's when you add the little extras on you moan about it
C	mm
A	but the general
B	yeah I mean they all get they all get this that and the other I mean they all get somewhere to stay in London
C	mm
B	and then they claim expenses for that house
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	silly things really
A	oh that was
B	yeah that is yeah yeah
A	they need something I think they said something like ten billion pound to spend on the Houses of Parliament
B	yeah
A	that's why they're saving that thirty billion
A	so
B	ah there's fiddling all over the place
C	yeah
A	well it happens everywhere doesn't it?
B	everywhere I mean in in in other countries they call it the black
A	economy isn't it?
B	economy don't they?
C	mm
B	and that's the same as this place is
A	yeah it's like it always has been though
B	well I mean the black economy in this country is say if you get a plumber in right? he say if you don't wanna pay if you don't wanna pay er just give us cash
A	yeah
B	that's it he's got his cash and that's it
A	money goes into the system though don't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	but these MPs and what have you they do it a different way don't they?
A	yeah yeah ah yeah it's
B	and there's
A	yeah
B	that's just that if you get caught then
B	you got a problem
A	you got the problem
C	mm
A	alright
B	really?
C	really?
A	she's been so she was so excited that I said I'd go and see her ride
C	ah
B	yeah?
C	so when does it start?
A	well she said they're leaving
B	yeah
C	right
A	so I've gotta get over to
B	yeah?
C	yeah
B	oh that's a good way
C	are lots of people there?
A	I don't know
B	is that where the steam museum is?
A	over that direction mm
B	yeah
A	over that direction
B	yeah
A	so gotta go over there
C	mm
A	right
B	would you like us to move your stool out the way so you can stand up sir?
A	no no I did have to take some
B	did you?
C	mm
B	are you you're still wearing up then?
A	oh
B	still grinding away then?
A	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I dread to think what the pain would be like er having that injection
B	well that's only a temporary
A	but I suppose it would be better than having your leg
B	split open and that yeah
B	I mean that er ball and joint thing was was
A	yeah
B	for the arthritic
A	mm
B	and they actually chop off
A	they chop a chunk off
B	a great big chunk
C	mm
B	and stick a stainless steel ball all the way down the marrow
A	into the marrow yeah
B	and screw it in
A	yeah
B	right? and then they gotta make a new socket
A	yeah
B	for the ball to fit in
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and they grind all that away
A	yeah
B	oh I saw one of these operations on the telly and they were using saws
B	yeah I know
C	they were actually using
B	yeah they use all these all these saws that you'd
A	yeah I know yeah well
B	amazing
A	so if they can find a a little bit of er gel to stick in it it'll be alright won't it?
B	that would that'd be good wouldn't it? yeah
C	mm
B	well we could have some sort of er
A	glue gun
