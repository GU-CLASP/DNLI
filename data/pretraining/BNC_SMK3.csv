D	it's and it's got a few they have some interesting characters on there
C	they don't treat the game with enough respect for my liking
D	well I I don't know I I think it it needed a bit of humour cos I was sitting there there watching Countdown
C	it was hysterical with er Richard Whiteley
D	yeah yeah
B	what did you get
C	twenty-one
B	wait a minute I I've got to go onto the second page

B	er er yeah I can put jest actually
D	mm
B	G if I had an R I could have put grew
D	G E
B	oh no jester's a J
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	unless it's gesture gesture
B	yeah and I don't have an I for gist
D	no could get rid of the
B	I can't put it here
D	mm
B	I've got to stop him going there for one thing
D	mm
B	oh er two three fifteen pathetic
C	better than nowt
B	well er it doesn't let you go there
D	mm
A	wondering if we need little sort of labels to say that's half flush and that's full flush cos there's nothing to indicate
C	no dear
A	which is the half flush
D	there is well there is if you look at the size of the buttons
A	oh
D	one's like a crescent which is
A	yeah
D	quite a bit one and the other one's a smaller one
A	oh
D	if you just
A	I thought they were the same oh they
D	no if you look at them one's bigger than the other
A	yeah okay
D	but the one nearest the wall is the small
A	oh no that's the I oh in that case it's very good cos that's the one I
D	is that the right? is is that how I did it?
A	no it think it was the one I thought it was the other way round er oh
D	oh oh I might have got
A	what did I?
D	I did spin it round did it the right way but
A	er
D	can't remember
A	I think I flushed the front one
D	that's the full one then
A	yeah
B	we're gonna have fun flushing it that's any that's
A	but that's the nearest the bigger one
D	what right the one nearest the wall
A	oh okay
D	is the small
A	yeah yeah that's what it thought
A	the one nearest the wall is the
D	is the small
A	half flush
D	yeah
A	yeah so and then oh so there's a crescent in
D	yeah
A	that one
D	yeah yeah
D	yeah exactly but the thing is it's
A	yeah
D	which I think will probably be faster cos it's all new erm the fact is is that you can actually press the button and it flushes
A	yeah
B	yes yeah exactly
D	yours was like ah oh
A	yeah
D	you know
A	but that was
D	yeah
A	such a gentle flush as well it was just pressing a button but no physical pressure
D	no exactly and I think I think like
A	exactly
D	erm if you press it and hold your finger on it
A	oh
D	and hold it down it it like er totally er empties the cistern it's a good
B	oh it's a real
A	oh cos I didn't do that
D	no I think I think
A	I just went tap and and it all
D	yeah you tap it and it
A	but
D	yeah well they're all
A	has a lot of suction
D	they're all
A	are they?
D	the yeah much better
A	the technology changed for toilets did it?
D	it's all changed and it's their overflow
B	and and
A	yeah
B	the overflow pipe isn't needed so that's the one that's actually currently going through the wall so that can be taken out
A	what's the overflow pipe?
B	well
D	well if suddenly it something gets jammed and it starts filling up and filling up and filling up
B	and not stopping
D	and filling up
A	mm
D	instead of it flooding all over the toilet floor it goes down the overflow pipe which was what that one was sticking through the wall that's the old style
A	yeah
D	type but now it it's all internal so if it starts to overflow it goes down the toilet pan
A	oh okay
D	it's all clever technology
A	okay so got a nice modern
B	mm
A	toilet gonna put a T shirt on it's nice it's nice and warm in here
B	gosh
D	well it is it is warm in here
B	but I wouldn't dream I'm wearing two cashmere
D	no
B	sweaters
D	no I wouldn't either
B	I wouldn't dream of taking either of them off
D	I'm not gonna I'm not gonna take my jumper either I'd rather get over warm
B	yes exactly
D	to be honest
C	thirteen
D	no I'm I'm alright I've had a couple
C	the lamb went in at quarter two I should just make a mental note
B	you want an hour didn't you say?
C	it wanted an hour yeah
B	yeah
C	then ten fifteen minutes to sit
B	yeah
D	I seen this something the other day in in when I was in a French DIY shop and it was er a collar it clamped
D	so taking more there so basically
B	yeah
D	as you've got your wood burner going
B	yeah
D	it's
C	makes me wonder
B	yeah
C	I've wondered why that's not sort of almost standard just to have a
B	yeah
C	vent up there to
B	yeah
C	for the hot air
D	yeah
B	to come out what they have nowadays here is the little fans that you sit on top
D	oh yeah yeah yeah I
C	and the heat
D	I've got to get one
C	and the heat
B	mm
D	starts it's the
C	and and has a motor
D	er it starts going yeah and
C	yeah
D	er well no they
C	no these have these have a motor but it's it's they like have two pieces of metal on a base and one is cooler than the other
D	mm
C	and for some reason don't ask me how that is able to run a current
D	mm
C	and then the
B	well yeah
D	yeah no I've well I mean I've seen that
B	this would develop an electrical
C	there you go
D	I've seen the ones that
B	a
D	if you you sit it on top of the stove
C	yeah
D	and it works on the heat
C	yeah
D	basically but then it
C	yeah
D	and in into the room no I've been meaning to get one for ages and
C	get one Amazon
D	yes yeah I'll erm I'll
C	there we go there's all the vowels
D	when she gets home
A	by the way I'm recording at the moment is that okay?
B	thirty-three
D	so I was told
B	what was that?
A	sorry?
A	oh
D	that's alright
B	what did you say?
A	yeah if you're alright about it
D	yeah well
B	the lamb he
A	I just thought I'd better let you know
D	no no
B	no he selected it didn't you? we asked
C	no darling that's a different topic
B	oh sorry
B	what did you say? I haven't got my hearing aids in
A	I told him he's being recorded
C	ah
B	oh yes
A	on there
B	oh yes and he doesn't know it
A	so
B	we told him
A	it's eighteen pounds for an hour of audio
B	thirty oh
C	don't tell him that
B	guess what?
C	cos we want the money
B	at the end of
A	he might want a share
B	at the end of this round this is a famous moment
C	mm
D	mm
D	not that's not bad
A	I've had worse ways of earning money though
B	you're yes
D	no indeed
A	you know
D	indeed yeah
A	it's like one of the best ways that I've had so far of earning eighteen pounds
B	is that what you get per hour?
A	just sit there talking er of audio
B	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	gosh when I invigilate I get paid what
A	oh no no not oh I see what you mean
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah per hour
B	I get paid
C	can I have a little of the the French please from the?
B	I get
D	oh okay
B	you know halls full of about a hundred and eighty students you know sitting GCSEs and things
D	sorry this
A	what do you get paid?
B	no
A	no no
B	they they
D	I'm not sure invigilate is
B	oh
D	making sure they're not cheating?
B	managing the examination
C	exactly yeah
B	yes yeah
D	or oh okay
B	managing the
D	oh oh I see
B	getting it out timing it
D	I see
B	we get seven seven just over seven pounds an hour
A	mm
B	but er
A	but that's not very much
B	but we enjoy it
A	really?
B	it no it's ridiculously little I it really is ridiculously little
A	that's so tiny because that's quite a big responsibility being
B	oh it is yeah
A	responsible for a great big room of
B	er yeah
A	kids
B	I mean if if we completely messed it up you know there's there's a ratio of people there there are you know for every you have to have one person for every thirty people present in the hall but one person runs the examination which is quite frequently
A	well
B	me
A	yeah
B	erm and erm that wait a minute till I rearrange that erm
D	hasn't
B	erm that
D	hasn't the minimum wage just gone up?
A	I thought that it had and I thought it was
B	and I think it's more than seven
A	I think it was more than seven
B	seven
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	I I couldn't tell you I just
A	yeah
D	the other morning and someone was talking about the minimum wage and
A	I I think it has but it might or it might be on about that they'll be getting away with minimum wage
B	oh they will yes yes
A	for that it's just just be minimum wage
B	I think we get er I get a bit more than
A	yeah
B	what it is
A	yeah
B	but I mean I enjoy it so much I'd I'd do it for nothing really so
C	mm
B	erm you now cos I just love
A	but people shouldn't you should get paid though
D	you shouldn't you shouldn't say things like that
B	no
D	you never know who'll be listening on that now
A	and that but I mean
B	but
A	a lot of people take advantage of that these days
B	yeah yeah
D	mm
B	but but it
A	so many people willing to work for free
D	mm
B	well yes yes but you see it's you know when you er it it I mean I coached
D	mm
B	some erm one of the the kids in the school whom I'd given a lift to because we were both stuck at the bus stop one day actually and she desperately wanted to get down to the train so I said to her well look I'm going back to get my car and I said you might recognise me I do invigilate in the school so that she'd be assured she wasn't getting in a
A	what a mess darling
A	are you going too?
C	can I have a little beer?
D	mm
B	I took her down and thereafter in school every time she saw me I got this great beam
B	and then I don't think I've told you this actually
C	you have
B	oh have I? because I met her in the corridor after she'd done her mocks and she'd got good As and Bs and she said but I got one D and I said what what was that in? and she said oh I just it's a subject I simply do not understand it's chemistry
D	oh
B	which is my subject you see
D	oh right
B	so I said to her well look you know come along and I'll give you some lessons if you want you see and the she's a
B	yes
D	er I don't want one of those
A	okay
B	the bigger one
C	bring
B	you know she said well how much will that be?
C	there's one more of
B	I said I said it won't be anything at all actually
D	yeah
B	so she came along for a week every morning for a couple of hours
C	oh so sweet
B	er and just for the week and her grade which er for her mocks she got a very poor D and in the actual exam she got a B
D	oh
C	oh well done
B	and actually reckon if she'd had one more lesson with me she would have got an A because funnily enough what I was going to do in the next lesson there was a whole question on the whole thing
D	thank you very much
C	so I think she would have actually got an A with one more lesson
D	that's so it just goes to goes to
B	so that the reward of that
D	so suddenly the penny dropped
B	well yes
D	and
B	well I explained the the sort of fundamentals of the thing
D	well exactly that's all it is sometimes yeah
B	yes see I think chemistry is taught completely wrongly cos I think the periodic table if you remember that do you? maybe not
D	yeah
B	I actually do think that if if GCSEs well any student of chemistry it's even more important the higher up you go if you actually understand all that
D	mm
B	you so much of it just
D	er
B	falls into place
D	it's it's
B	did you?
D	in fact
B	yeah
D	I hated chemistry I hated biology but I loved physics
B	yeah
D	but I couldn't do it er I was never any good at it because of maths
B	really?
D	basically which is why
A	oh
B	are you no good at maths?
D	er
B	oh no right
D	er I er average
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
D	didn't and
B	and that's key
D	erm
B	that is really is key isn't it?
A	yeah
D	erm but I can't remember the biology teacher's name it was a a lady but she was just a little Hitler
B	yeah
D	oh it er everyone hated her anyway
A	and whereas
B	yeah
A	if you'd had a good teacher
D	indeed indeed
A	it could have
B	yeah
A	influenced
B	well
A	your whole life
B	well it it it
D	but yeah
B	influences it
A	yeah
B	and it can make or destroy your whole life
D	yeah
A	exactly
D	chemistry I think I think I
B	the actual
D	the actual
B	subject
D	subject
B	yeah
D	itself
B	yeah
D	and I just remember going to first chemistry lesson or
B	yeah
A	it's just such a terrible
D	like that
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	and erm
B	er
D	that was it
B	well exactly
D	it was instant dislike
D	just like
A	oh
D	you don't even know me
B	yeah
D	you know and obviously
B	yeah
D	he was Scottish and he used to say iron his
B	iron
D	and I I mean and I would I I would
D	play up on it and he got and I'd stick my hand and go
D	sorry I er what I sorry I didn't quite understand that
B	stand that
D	what did you say? and he's go
B	iron
D	mm no no
D	oh what you mean iron?
D	oh okay and then it was like that all the time
A	I bet he made that
A	you had to then sort of be a bit have an
D	oh god I I hated him
A	to him because he'd
B	yeah yeah
D	that was it I know er it was constant
A	kind of done it to you
B	but he first
B	yeah
D	constant but
B	but but
A	so how dare he do that in a
B	the golden rule about teaching is you never compare one pupil with a sibling
A	he doesn't even know you you know
D	to a to a sibling no
A	but the whole
D	no
B	yeah
A	attitude of just
B	or any time you know even sort of
D	yeah
B	five years into the courses
A	that's very rude isn't it? it's got no respect if someone just
B	yeah
A	points at you
B	yeah
A	and says that
B	yeah
A	that's that's terrible
D	yeah it was
A	yeah yeah?
D	even though geography was a
A	yeah
D	it was the only only erm O level I got actually was geography
B	really?
A	mm
B	yeah
D	but the all the rest were CSEs you know?
B	yeah yeah
D	or GCSE or whatever they were called then
B	yes yes it will be CSEs as opposed to
D	CSEs it was
B	GCEs
D	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
D	and geography and and it was like you know it was quite a high grade but it was a B or something I dunno I remember
B	yes yes yeah
D	but it was because
A	and it was because the teacher was good
D	I loved the teacher
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	and she was a rather attractive Geordie teacher
A	mm
B	teacher and good
A	yeah
D	but very good
B	good er a teacher
D	very hard you know
A	yeah
D	and she had an accent but I didn't play on what you know
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	at all but she was really good
A	oh it's rubbish isn't it really?
B	yeah
D	and she gave praise when praise was needed do you know what I mean?
B	yes yeah
D	it was like you know you'd have projects and things and
B	yeah
D	and she thought it was worthwhile and
A	as for being interested in
B	well the trouble is
A	if you're interested that should be enough even if
B	mm
D	yeah
A	you're falling down on one side of it almost should be compensated by the fact that you're loving it and you're fascinated by it
C	so
D	indeed indeed
A	so it should be okay
B	yeah but the thing is
A	even if
B	I'm afraid that schools
C	sixteen mummy
B	schools are full of very well you know
C	funnily enough
B	bad teachers
C	the
D	mm
B	many schools have bad teachers I had
A	yeah
C	we had all my teachers were pretty terrible apart from the geography teacher
B	how much was that? sixteen
C	sixteen he was excellent and I think almost the entire class got As
D	yeah
C	partly cos he did all our coursework
D	well
C	but in a very
A	he wasn't nipping out for fags all the time
C	no he was er
B	who was that again?
A	would make an excuse that they'd forgotten to photocopy something
C	I can't remember his name
A	and go out
C	a year after I left
A	and have a fag
D	oh have a cigarette not
A	yeah
D	cos fags in
C	he fell off a mountain
D	fags are something else in schools aren't they?
A	oh
B	really? really?
D	oh yeah in public schools
B	did he survive?
D	aren't they? fags are runners
A	oh it's oh are they?
D	for the older boys aren't they?
A	I don't know oh I don't know
D	is that right
C	yeah that's why I kind of went er?
A	oh
D	yeah runners they're bitches for the older boys aren't they?
C	yeah fags
D	yeah
A	well I don't know the public school etiquette
C	cos there's that scene in er Mr Chips in Mr they call me Mr Chips he he goes into the sixth form and puts his feet up on a desk and asks the sixth formers to make him some toast and polish his shoes and they went we don't do that sir we're we're in the
A	oh Mr Chips
B	yeah right yes yes
C	mm
B	yeah right now
A	oh yeah
C	there's only two letters left
A	oh god
B	let
A	yeah cos I've been transcribing the ones we recorded
B	there's only two letters left
A	over Christmas and and I left these lot in the room having a game of Scrabble and then
A	cos
B	and then he's coming up with a
A	and then it's like
A	can I submit this audio? because there's an awful lot of gaps and not much talking
D	oh right
B	this has been probably the most difficult game to play the board
C	it started with my first word didn't it?
B	yeah
A	was it a comprehensive school that you went to?
D	mm
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah
A	where? in in
D	in
A	Hinterland?
D	yeah
A	mm
D	but yeah you could sit in in the classroom and look out er out the window and across the
A	yeah
D	the playground and whatever and there's the steelworks
A	mm
D	and this is where most people went to work
C	right
D	straight from school including me
A	mm but then
B	was that aged aged sixteen then?
D	yeah that sounds right so
B	yeah yeah

D	you know
B	yeah
D	once you've got your so I I've
B	mm
D	got talked into getting a trade behind me so I went into the steelworks and had a four year apprenticeship in engineering and
A	probably helped though
B	but that was as far removed from wood
C	so did you learn your?
D	oh and it is yeah
C	I bet you learnt your chippy skills from your dad
D	er
B	like like
D	well no no not really
A	did you get an A level in chippy?
D	I did you know
D	I did woodwork at school you know and then yeah and
A	chippiology
D	yeah
D	though I didn't no I never trained as a chippy at all but er you know did I I worked I did a four-year apprenticeship and then I did two years as
B	yeah
D	as a an engineer working in in one of the mills
B	yeah cos
D	and then got made redundant
D	and then walked finished work on the Friday and started work on the Saturday for working with the
C	oh that's alright
B	ah
D	who I'd been working for in my summer holidays anyway
B	right yeah
D	I'd take my summer holidays and then go on
C	did you like the job in the steelworks?
A	hello
D	mm some some of it not all of it I didn't like the start at eight and finish at four thirty
D	the regular yeah
C	unremitting nature of work
D	I used to prefer working shifts
C	yeah
D	at
A	did alright didn't you?
D	yeah
A	came out alright
D	yeah
D	alright I'm or my

D	my other sister's mid-forties
B	yeah well
A	shall I stir the potatoes?
C	if you like darling
A	might might be a bit early actually when did we put it in?
C	quarter to
A	oh that's
C	that's when the lamb went oh no that's when they both when in then
D	do you put the potatoes in after you put the meat in?
C	they went in the same time cos I decided the lamb only needs an hour
B	but I said
D	oh
B	put them in at the same time and it was overruled
D	oh no no I
B	yeah
D	cos we normally put our potatoes in early before
B	yeah
D	meat oh well cos you parboil them
B	yes
D	and then
C	well
D	put them in and then I put them in the oven for quarter of an hour twenty minutes and then I put the meat in
B	really?
C	I like well done things
D	mm
B	so you're two six one and
D	mm
C	oh damn it I can't think of anywhere good to go oh look there's a double up there triple I mean never even seen that
B	eighteen so that puts you up to two seven nine and I
C	the last letter
B	well look at this my look at the last letter I pick up
C	X for minx
B	yeah
D	mm
B	which might mean and indeed it does
A	so maybe our toilet was a nineteen eighties toilet
C	four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
B	oh
C	thirteen
D	don't know what it was
B	the previous run was two seven nine two eight two
D	possibly
B	thirteen
D	it's been there a while hasn't it?
A	yeah yeah I get that impression
D	mm
A	what happened to it? is it in the front?
D	just the front garden
A	do you want to plant something in it
C	it's been mooted
D	I
A	yes
C	and no
C	good riddance
D	yeah go straight to the tip
A	but then if you know all the sort of stuff that you know you're never really without work so it's brilliant really I mean everyone needs the sort of thing that you can do done
D	indeed
A	mm
D	yeah no I've got
A	so it's really useful to have
D	yeah
A	those skills and obviously someone taught you life skills
D	I suppose so
A	proper skills not useless skills
D	well erm well I dunno
A	what does that what does that mean you needs must?
D	well sometimes you think well
B	I've got pathetic letters now
C	I've got vowels here
B	yeah two three four oh five wait a minute
D	in in let's say in in the world of of tradesmen there's so many cowboys and people who just wanna rip you off
A	yeah
D	just take the money think you don't know better
A	yeah
D	and it really really
A	it really upsets you
D	yeah it does
A	that that is the case
D	it does that is the case
A	yeah
D	and it's wrong
A	well because that is it is so morally wrong isn't it? and
D	yes
A	like if I was on my own and I didn't have
D	no
A	they can just
D	yeah it's
A	do that can't they?
D	no exactly
A	just it's a
D	and I'm not saying that that you know there are ways of of like pulling up the right tradesmen and things so
A	mm
D	I think a lot of it is to do with with that you know a lot of it
C	thirteen mama
A	mm uhu
D	I would rather if it takes me twice as long I don't care
A	you're in control of it
D	but at least
A	you know the job's being done
D	I know it's being done
A	yeah
D	so if I make a mistake I'll learn more
B	are you zig?
C	no
B	well unfortunately you we
C	did you get a vowel?
B	no I don't think I can
C	what have you got?
B	a U and an I
C	do you still minus yeah?
B	yeah no no because we didn't finish
C	yeah but then it just comes off your own score and it doesn't get added to anyone else's score
B	oh does it? is that so? oh right so you you get three 0 four and I get two eight five
C	there you go dear
B	you see because you scored thirty-nine point five and then you scored thirteen
C	then again another go
B	and I couldn't score at all
C	well thank you dear
B	well well that
A	yeah
D	cos that's how it's
A	and that is better than
D	yeah
A	yeah and that's that's the attitude to take really but I do know that thing of if you want it done well you have to do it yourself even though it's taking bloody ages
D	no I know like yeah
D	no no I
A	but er yeah
D	and I suppose that's the other thing isn't it? it's better to be patient
A	yeah
D	well
A	yeah you can get
D	that's the other thing
A	yeah
D	cos you know cos then you
A	yes
D	and you could appreciate it
A	yeah and you know it from the inside out
D	and also there's a sense of that you've done it yourself
A	mm
D	so you take more pride in it
A	mm
D	and you go well you know
A	yeah
D	I did that look
A	yeah
D	it's still there
A	well that's very fundamental a a fundamental sort of approach to life really if you like
D	but I I I really think that anybody can
A	I'm sure they can it's just there's this mystery
D	yes oh I mean like if you want you know I reckon oh
A	yeah yeah
D	it's just the
A	it's just but
D	knowing
A	it's what someone
D	and having and having the confidence
A	and what you're exposed to in life your influences so if your dad exposed you to all this
D	mm
A	then or my mum exposed me to sewing so it's just on your radar so you
D	yeah
A	yeah but it's weird I dunno maybe schooling could be a bit more I dunno
D	mm what is it darling?
C	I need the phone
B	you want the what?
A	what do you want?
C	the phone
B	what for?
A	a phone?
C	to take a picture of the board to help
B	why?
A	for transcription
B	oh does it? oh right
A	oh no it'll be alright they're only
B	ah
C	okay
A	yeah
B	right what did I
C	if I'd thought about it I would have done braised carrots but it's
A	mm
D	braised carrots?
C	braised
D	braised in what?
C	just a little bit of water just so it boils off then you've just got butter garlic and they caramelise quite tasty
D	you you can just steam some
C	yeah that's what I wanna do now
D	oh
C	just be a bit fancier
D	oh
B	well darling
D	oh
C	in the bag with those
A	it's a bit early to steam them now
D	throw them in throw them in your oven with everything else throw them in
B	yeah I'm a great carrots
D	well roasted carrots they taste literally
B	yes
D	they have a different taste when they're roasted
A	yeah they're lovely
C	yeah we love them roasted
A	I like roasted vegetables
B	why don't you just shove them in with the roast then?
A	all roasted vegetables
C	er because that compromises your gravy because there's too much water content in a carrot
B	so darling no you could put
B	them in a different dish
C	that would be
A	right
A	mm
B	but then in the penultimate round he got
C	well
B	thirteen and I got five
A	yeah
B	and then in the next round he got thirteen and I couldn't play
A	right
B	so so consequently it was a twenty-six at the end against five
C	is this from Aldi or you brought it with you?
B	no no I bought it from Aldi when I
D	that erm
D	where's it from?
B	it it's er
B	er yeah
C	er sorry Italian
B	yeah
D	right
C	or do you mean what shop?
B	er nice
D	mm?
C	did you mean what shop or where what country?
B	no no it's
D	no no yeah yeah country
D	no
A	do you want to put some more?
D	I didn't
B	yeah
D	recognise the label
B	yes yes
D	as
B	yeah
D	were all French
B	ah right yes
D	but that's not French
B	no no that's a an Italian Montepulciano er which is mustn't have any more actually but er
D	so have you have you found any nice Greek wines?
B	yes some fabulous Greek wines
D	oh right
B	yes some really good Greek wine
D	not Retsinas or anything yeah
B	oh well I love Retsina as well actually but
D	oh
B	you know Retsina is Retsina but erm there are and there are actually some very nice Retsinas but there are there are some very nice er there are a lot of vineyards in Greece and in fact
D	yeah
B	when we went up into the mountains further north Kalavryta we went to a a vineyard which is an organic vineyard you know and we were shown round the whole place
D	right
B	you know and then we went up to the most exotic wonderful room erm where he
D	mm
B	and we we bought a whole selection of them there actually
D	oh right
B	erm and he er sells amongst other places he sells to Harrods you know so he sort of top of the market stuff er but and you know
D	right
B	and then over in the the peninsula the western peninsula the Messenia er
D	right
B	er er but extremely extremely quaffable
D	dry or?
B	oh yes yes
D	yeah
B	dry yes
D	yeah
B	we only drink dry whites yes yes er yeah
D	what's the other
B	yeah
D	is it Ouzo is the?
B	yeah Ouzo yes now Ouzo I can't drink at all actually
D	oh
B	yes that's a the the Greeks drink it mixed with water usually
D	oh well so the French
B	yes yeah the
D	it's Pastis isn't it?
B	yes yes yes I think it's disgusting
D	it's er it's aniseed isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
D	no I I can drink Pastis but oh Ouzo er
B	but Retsina is
D	mm
B	you know that's the thing and if you have you know particularly if you have something like grilled octopus
D	mm
B	you know Retsina is a good wine to have with things like that
D	yeah
B	aye
B	mm
A	the Truro
B	what was that?
A	we've got the Truro
D	oh Cornish
A	range
B	oh is that
A	our toilet
B	is that what you've got?
A	yeah
B	yeah but it's nice
A	been to Truro
B	and you see yes it it bypasses the window frame which I think is a nice
A	there was a bit of wallpaper behind the tiles wasn't there?
D	was there?
A	yes
D	oh right the the history
A	yeah
B	behind the tiles up there?
A	yeah
B	is there?
A	mm
B	well of course it used to be presumably it used to be a bedroom
A	a bedroom
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	probably
B	yeah
C	I've used the loo
A	and which flush did you use?
C	well actually they're the same size both buttons
D	they're not
A	well they're
D	they're not the same size
C	well then it's a fine line
A	it's a very fine line
D	it is a fine line
B	what did you say?
D	it is a fine line
A	but one is
B	it's a same what?
A	like that one's concave one's convex in well not that way but in shape
C	I think you'd need a mathematician
D	no well no if you look at
A	so
C	to prove
D	well one is more
A	no
D	of a crescent moon shape
A	yeah
D	and the other one is slightly smaller it
C	but it's difficult
A	the one
D	anyway
A	that sticks out is
C	er the next challenge for me is
A	big flush
C	I will try and recreate the original window frame
A	how will you do that?
C	it got chopped up
D	no no indeed those look a bit odd
C	yeah
D	yeah just a bit of architrave to just patch it in
C	yeah
D	erm we were chat I was chatting to your mum when we were up there in the bathroom
C	as you do
A	admiring the toilet
D	when when you get round to it you know to sort out your consider reducing the size of the window
B	so that the basin
D	just bring it up so that you could bring your sink in underneath the window
C	where there's already a water supply
D	well that
B	yeah
D	doesn't matter
B	yeah
D	about that but it just means it frees up more wall space for everything else cos er that window's really low and actually it's quite I think it's quite dangerous
B	yeah
D	you could easily trip and fall out of the
D	do you know what I mean? whereas
A	I imagine
B	well er
A	doing that
B	but also actually
B	but if if the if the blind is up you're absolutely at exposed level as well actually
D	well well indeed yeah and you don't need
B	you know
A	yeah
D	you don't you just need a good
A	hello
B	yeah exactly
C	well what I'd like to do is move the bathroom
A	hello
C	just
B	full frontal views
A	hello
D	mm
C	and then I'd turn that room into the spare bedroom and it would be a double room
B	mm? mm mm
C	yeah
A	you got an uhu from
B	oh no er no I'm just hearing what you're saying you'd change the
C	yeah I suppose so
B	yeah
D	mm
C	cos then both spare rooms would be just either end of the house both bedrooms
B	yeah
D	I suppose you've got that break between
B	yeah well I I
A	yeah
B	you're you're thinking that the the bathroom would more more easily accommodate double beds and wardrobes and things than
C	yeah and since it's an arbitrary choice anyway where you put the bath when you move it upstairs and you lose a bedroom I don't know why they chose
A	that one
C	you know a nice rear facing large room when there was a small
A	less yeah true
C	interconnecting room
A	cos that's probably a nicer
B	it's not
A	room for a bedroom
B	interconnecting really
C	I mean between
B	yeah yeah right yeah
D	probably
B	but remember you want to make it into two rooms anyway
D	probably something to do with the waste
B	yeah
D	maybe maybe
B	yeah
D	getting access to the drain cos that's
B	yeah
D	the nearest point
B	that's
C	that it's it's just drops
D	you
C	straight down yeah but you've got gravity in your on your side haven't you?
D	oh indeed yeah
B	yeah
D	yeah you can run it down the house
C	as long as it's not the front room
D	yeah
A	but interesting what you were saying about getting rid of the chimney breast cos I was sort of looking at the
A	I was looking at the dining room and kind of going how much more yeah there would be quite a lot more room it would seem like quite a big space
B	oh I I think
C	it's not that breast darling it's that it's it's
A	you know trying to cover it cover up the chimney
C	not that one
A	I thought it was that one
C	no it would be it's the one in the bathroom the back of the house
A	no no
B	no no but no but
D	no no we were talking about it
B	talking about no we were talking about
C	oh you mean separately?
B	earlier on about moving
D	yeah
B	probably when you were watching the rugby
C	yeah no I'd like to because I don't
A	but I mean looking at the
B	either fireplace
A	room it's kind of silly to
C	either fireplace on that side side
A	just have that sticking out
C	hello shut the door
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	without well either have a fireplace and have it utilised
B	yeah
A	as a chimney
B	but then it's not big enough to
A	or
B	your
A	oh we we wouldn't want
B	in there
A	that anyway
B	yeah
C	cos we don't need one in either of the rooms that that
A	but I just think as a principle in the house either have a functioning
B	fireplace
A	sticky out thing
B	or not have it at all
A	fireplace or not have it so
C	mm
B	yeah
A	it makes sense to not have that definitely but then I thought what is going on my office?
C	but it would open up all the space in your office too
B	well it wouldn't because that would
A	well
B	stay as it is
A	would it though?
C	no cos it would
A	this is what I'm
B	hey but listen
B	well a moving a you know you know move any floor off a weight supporting area you have to put RSJs in er on each
C	it's not it's not the floor though is it?
B	and every floor
C	it's it's just you take the chimney that's running down there plus the the other bit's just infill for some reason
A	then why why is that so
B	no no no
A	such a strange?
B	I think we'll leave the study as it is cos you you looked at that anyway
A	mm
B	I mean that's the foundations of the house really cos oh
D	mm I don't know how it works down there
B	yeah
D	cos you're on a hill so
B	yeah
D	there's a lot more
B	well it's
D	going on
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's dug into the hill
D	so I
B	yeah
D	but if you are thinking about taking the chimneys out I would start
B	on the bedroom
D	well you you'd get into the loft
B	yeah
D	and and do the necessary RSJs and support work in the loft
B	yeah
D	to hold up what's above the roof
B	yeah
D	then you can just take out the bedroom you can take out
B	oh really? you don't need a an RSJ each and every place?
D	no there's no just
B	no because you're only supporting what's above there
C	no there will only
D	you
B	you've supported what's
D	held up what
B	still to be
D	exactly
B	supported
D	what needs to be there
B	yeah
D	and you just take out
B	yeah
C	you're removing
B	yeah
D	then you just take out
B	that's right yes yes
D	out out from underneath of it
C	from under it
B	yeah yeah
D	and making good so
B	yeah
D	need to be
B	extended
D	extended
B	yeah
D	and done properly not just
B	and into the wall
B	yeah yeah
D	it needs to go into the wall
B	yeah
D	and so
B	yeah
A	right
D	once you've taken that away you need to put a support in to hold up the rest of your ceilings you know so
B	yeah yes
A	yeah
B	I mean it's a major job
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	it's like a knock-on all the time
A	yeah
D	you have to
A	yeah yeah
D	go like right
A	yeah
D	but if you start from the top it's easier because
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	you've got you haven't got to support every section
B	no
D	if you know what I mean
B	no yeah
A	mm not like cos
B	a hammer and knocked out
A	a hammer and just knocked a hole for the patio doors without putting any supports up or anything like that and
B	and it was
A	and he's a builder so he said er erm
B	mm mm
A	he helped sort of put construct whatever it is that they call it to er
B	an RSJ to
A	yes
D	yeah yeah run supports and er
A	yeah
D	oh right
B	yeah
A	but er yeah so
D	what what nationality were the previous owners?
A	they no I think they were British I
D	right
A	I think but erm
B	they were an odd
A	transsexuals
B	one of them was a
A	but that's not a nationality but
B	no
A	if it's of any interest
D	I bet in some countries it is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	is that right? yeah
A	transgender's
B	no
A	cos there's so many transgender had loads of transgender people at my last place no my where
B	really?
A	yeah yeah I mean one
B	no er has a trans
A	one one girl in my
B	has a transgender actually biologically changed sex or are they just dressing in the other sex?
A	no it's biologically it's biologically
B	they've been
A	changing
B	they've been operated
A	yeah
B	on?
A	yeah
B	I mean they emotionally
A	yeah
B	feel the other way
D	er prior to that
A	it gets
D	are they just called transvestites? is it
A	erm
D	is it is it transvestite?
B	or is it a transvestite the person who person who likes
A	that's probably a bit of an old-fashioned term but
B	dressing up?
A	I don't know
D	I don't
A	but
B	yeah
A	there's the cosmetic just
B	yeah the transgender is something
A	yeah you feel like you're
B	sort of fundamental
A	another
B	you feel you're in the wrong body
A	yeah
B	cos you're in the wrong sex
A	that's right erm
B	yeah
A	and there there was a nice girl in our department who said made an announcement at a meeting and said a meeting I'm going to have an operation and from now on I want to be known as er
D	oh a girl going to a boy?
A	when I come back
B	yeah
A	yeah girl to a boy and erm
D	oh right yeah cos it's that's
A	she came
D	that's not so common is it?
B	no a girl to a boy
A	well I I kind of know both actually
D	mm
A	but anyway she came back erm a boy erm
B	did she looks like a boy?
A	left came back and visited and there was this this this boy walked in this this man walked in and I thought oh you know he's quite he's a good looking man you know muscles and deep voice you know the whole thing you know totally all man and it was
B	her
A	her
B	her her as had been
A	it was
B	yeah yeah
A	this
B	yeah do you know
B	some church er er I mean not a not a an orthodox one I mean one of the more er non-conformist one has just baptised I I think I think she's six
A	but why?
B	so aged six
A	oh
B	she was a boy who wants to be a girl
A	well apparently
B	and and the
A	that happens
B	this church has actually
A	yeah
B	agreed to sort of baptise her but I mean it's quite amazing that a six-year-old erm
A	I don't I don't understand it myself
B	yeah yeah no well no
A	it's er
B	it's
A	there's a lack of information about it so
B	all of those weirdo sort of well everything
D	well I I I've personally I well each to their own whatever they wanna do
B	yeah
D	that's fine but I mean whatever body you're born into as long as you're healthy
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	I tend to think that
D	why why mess around?

A	yeah
B	very sadly died
A	oh
B	actually that was
A	that's really sad
B	a the do you know this?
A	terrible story
B	and
A	yeah
B	and erm this therefore means fifty years ago
D	mm
B	and erm
A	ah
B	but
A	no
B	so she was
A	and couldn't have a
B	she
A	civil partnership or anything
B	no no oh no I mean
A	no
B	she was unrecognised
A	so
B	you know
A	yeah
A	that's awful
B	she was just swept aside and she didn't know what was going on with
A	and all the next of kin were the family
B	she was completely distraught and we'd actually
A	ah
B	up in
A	was she living with her?
B	you know she was just
A	and everything?
B	oh yeah they were
A	yeah
B	they they were living in a flat together
A	but so therefore
B	and she's actually never really
A	but did her family the family of the partner not
B	oh yes
A	acknowledge didn't acknowledge her at all?
B	oh yes they did
A	oh they did?
