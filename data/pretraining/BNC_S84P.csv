A	yeah
C	we don't like them  we don't like them  So not like those those ones that I bought today are a little bit better
A	well I don't know that one you gave me had a big thing on it
C	mm
B	mm
A	I think the you know I'm not snobby with that kind of thing but I think if you're going to be drinking a glass of wine you don't want to be feeling stuff pinching your lip
C	yeah but
B	yeah
C	where were yours from?
A	mm
B	I can't remember now
A	well we could have well we've got two packs we've opened
B	unless they've just gone a cheaper per made?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	well they're like they are the cheap
A	I mean if I was drinking I would be like mm
C	yeah you don't want it to to
A	you wanna be enjoying your drink not thinking oh that's a bit sharp on my lip
B	mm
C	yeah you don't want to people to even notice do you
A	no you don't wanna even
B	well you can ask where the where the pubs get them from
A	yeah
C	do they have plastic glasses?
B	they do occasionally don't they?
A	well some of them do don't they?
B	barbeques and things like that and
C	yeah they did turn to but some of the pubs turned to plastic glasses cos to stop people fighting with glasses
A	yeah
B	all these barbeque events like the school's er ones I'm I'm sure I'm sure they all had
C	it's weird though cos they have the budget to just go and buy them and then throw them away though
B	probably
C	I'm sure
A	mm
C	I'm sure they have like ooh right here's fifty pounds for the cutlery oh
B	mm
C	it's silly isn't it?
A	mm
C	no that's glass glasses
B	glasses yeah
C	we can't have glass cos if it smashes on the grass
A	right okay
B	no they'd be all over the place
A	yeah
C	and you won't be able to clear it up at all
A	no
C	they'd be no chance cos they
B	if they knock over on the glass on the grass and then someone trod accidently treads on them
A	yeah
C	you can't clear it up can you it's just ingrained
B	and if people fall over you
A	yeah
C	it's not like it's on the floor in a pub
B	yeah I think
A	okay
B	mm
C	that's the main thing we can't yeah we can't do that
A	mm
B	six

A	he hasn't got his own little space?
C	no
A	right
C	I think that's the ship
B	I've forgotten what we need on this
A	um
C	yes it depends what you
B	mm
A	you have to try and cover all of
C	everything
B	mm
A	yeah
C	because they've er equalled the the sheep have a higher status now
B	yeah
C	no no seriously
A	equal rights for sheep
