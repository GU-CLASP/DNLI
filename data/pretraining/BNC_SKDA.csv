B	yeah but what one do you want? well you've been having the jalfrezi
A	the one with the extra bits on it
B	no
A	I don't know
D	I might have the rogan josh
B	you get extra bits in all of them
C	that's what I was thinking
B	but I can't remember which curry you actually had oh that's a new one
C	this is different it's not the same as the one in
D	is it not?
C	said it was the same no
D	oh no it doesn't look the same as the one in
C	doesn't look the same at all
D	in
C	they've got different whiskys on here as well
D	they've changed it since we were last here
C	ah
D	when I when I ordered the burger last time it was down in this section they they've updated their menu
C	it's more expensive this is two forty in
D	oh is it?
C	yeah
D	we did one
C	so it is different different versions
D	unless it's just gone up check your menu again
B	that's
C	I was only there like a few days ago
D	alright then
C	last weekend
B	that's sweet potato chickpea and spinach curry is a new one
D	oh right so they've updated their menu again
B	yeah
C	you gonna go for that one?
D	are you getting the large
B	no I don't think so
A	or maybe er
C	what what tickles your fancy? what do you normally have?
B	erm the jalfrezi I think is it?
C	yeah chicken jalfrezi
B	yeah
A	is that what I normally have?
B	I think so
C	I might go for the lamb
D	mm rogan josh
C	is it curries all round then?
A	yeah
D	yeah looks like it doesn't it?
C	sounds like a good idea are you getting a drink?
D	ah probably
C	I mean it does come with it
A	it comes with a drink anyway
C	it comes with it seems a bit silly not to get it doesn't it?
B	I might have the rogan josh actually cos we don't often have a lamb one do we?
D	I like it I'm tempted by the chicken tikka masala
A	I'll have a chicken tikka masala
B	well that's what you have normally off of that menu when that's what they do any er
D	anyway
B	anyway they always have that one you don't normally have that on not when not when it's curry day
C	that guess it's pointing not
D	oh yeah
C	the ambient sound
B	you could that's going large you can have that with all of them
A	right let's get that then
B	it doesn't matter which curry you have you can have that with it
A	alright rose petal go and get it
D	I'm still debating give me a second
C	you having chips with it
B	so you make your curry large by adding a vegetable samosa and a large onion bhaji
A	that's it that's it
D	ah
C	does it make the actual curry large? or does it just
B	no
A	no
D	no you just get a bhaji and a samosa
C	you just get more
B	yeah you just get a bhaji and
D	I dunno whether to make one of ours large how much is a large then?
C	we can make one of them large and we'll share the samosa and the bhaji
D	bhaji
A	and their portion of chips
B	I think it's an extra pound
D	and er does it not come with where did the chips come with the?
D	ah right
A	but I I don't like them wafer things
D	no yeah
C	poppadums
D	poppadums yeah they're a bit of a nonentity aren't they?
A	yeah waste of time really
D	I don't know whether to get a rogan josh or a chicken tikka masala
D	alright alright I
A	yeah you did
D	so maybe I'll get the tikka masala or a chicken balti
B	oh I think I might have had the rogan josh last time when you had it didn't I?
D	yeah
B	cos the lamb was really like
D	tender
B	tender wasn't it?
D	yeah it was tender lamb
C	was it good? I'm definitely going for that then
D	alright me too
A	so we'll get three of them and a chicken thingamajig

C	did you see that noodle house just as you walked down?
D	yeah yeah yeah
C	it's like eight pound for a tiny little bowl of some noodle thing
D	oh is it?
C	it's terrible

C	you're on the other side of the road I mean
A	blah blah blah blah
A	when in fact you know you don't know where you're going
C	no
A	but yeah I mean driving is just staying on the right when you go round a roundabout you're not that way you're that way
C	it's just everything in reverse
A	and then you stay on the right again
C	yeah you didn't go wrong many times or?
A	no no no no
C	that's good
A	no I think I did once and then I soon corrected that was on a little road no traffic and I corrected it

A	yeah yeah yeah we went
C	oh yeah nice
A	it was like a just one big room boarded like a toilet and bathroom and kitchen all in one at the back yeah it done for the night
C	it had a kitchen in it?
A	yeah yeah
C	you make your own tea or coffee
A	yeah but there was a bistro right next door
C	yeah
A	and we ended up eating there in the end oh dear
C	was Bruges nice? where did you prefer Antwerp or Bruges?
A	for the market in Bruges yeah definitely
C	er
A	yeah there was hundreds of stalls once a year they opened it and there was just well they reckon between seventy and a hundred thousand people visited in a day
C	god
A	it was huge absolutely huge
C	it's like a massive festival isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
C	did you find were were the prices good in the market?
A	yeah weren't bad yeah
C	all in euros?
A	yeah oh yeah in euros
D	the food sounded amazing

B	oh
D	it shits on our
C	Europe's pretty good on that front
A	oh the bread
D	you can see why Europeans come here and like British
A	I mean the bread over here's crap to that over there
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	weren't it? it was really good over there weren't it?
C	it's even worse in Korea
D	people were really friendly and treating them well
C	and it's so clean and tidy and over there
D	should be
A	yeah
D	no
B	when we went to Bruges the satnav the last roundabout you come to the satnav turns you right
D	yeah
B	so which was wrong and we went down and it wasn't there and then this little man come
C	he took you?
B	so off he goes on his little bike his little old legs going
A	road no no no he goes back back back and away
B	and then he
D	is it just cos he was little? was he was he a midget?
B	no no no
A	no no
D	oh right sorry
C	why did you think he was a midget?
D	you said a little man
B	well it's cos he wasn't very tall
D	oh right
B	you know he was just a
A	about the same size as mum
B	no he was a
D	just wondering why
B	well yeah because his little legs were going because we were in the car you know
D	ah so he was going really fast
B	yeah
C	so he was cycling really fast
D	ah
A	and he took us there
B	and he
A	ah that's nice of him
C	it's amazing how kind and helpful people can be when you need
D	they really are
A	out of the blue
C	the amount of times we've had some people just help us for no reason whatsoever
A	he could think we was lost
D	in every country in every country you realise that people aren't what the news makes it out to be
C	no they are genuinely kind and
D	the majority of people are just people
B	are just yeah are nice

D	we were desperately running around trying to find somewhere to call to call in New Year
C	and ended up in the red light district
B	oh
D	cos we were in a weird kind of city it was obviously in the wrong part of the city and er we were going in and out and we went down this road and there were just pictures of Japanese women's faces looking innocent enough but we knew it couldn't have been quite right but they were all like it and we were like we ended up in some golf bar or something
C	or something
D	with the four of us calling in New Year absolutely smashed
C	we were hammered
D	we had a couple of bottles of Jameson's in our bags in the evening so you know

B	oh
B	can go halves
C	he did he did offer but I was like no I can't really
D	but he paid for it in a way
C	well yeah I did seven hours of recording with him er yeah over a couple of days and then I did well I managed to do fourteen hours in the three days I was at home
D	but I still thought in a restaurant of an evening three people desserts four pints like six seven pints between you and for the meal seventy pounds is
C	the problem for me is the curry was no better than this
B	mm
D	I don't think it is in a lot of places
C	I actually think it was a little bit worse
B	I mean that takeaway one in
D	yeah I used to think it was good but I
A	it's crap mum's is the best one
D	yeah yours is
A	nice and thick and spicy
D	you've started to do a more generic just that general one where you cook the rice and that's really quite similar to yours actually
D	we stuck it in a wrap and then put the wrap in the George Foreman and see we had like a toasted tortilla yeah
C	yeah we had like a curry panini thing
D	yeah
A	oh the old George Foreman's come in handy then

C	oh yeah you get like a little pot's like eighteen pounds
D	it's meant to come from like the best type of erm best type of what's special about manuka honey exactly?

C	but I refuse to pay eighteen pound for honey
D	Korean yeah yeah
C	do you remember in China that honey?
D	it's really weird expensive honey and then in the bottom of it
C	really expensive
D	it must come from some old tradition of having something in your honey there'll be little like
C	there was a chess piece
D	a plastic chess piece
C	and do you know when you get a you know when you get a stick with a balloon on it?
D	yeah
C	and there's that little bit of plastic that connects the stick to the
D	yeah
C	there was one of those in the honey
D	in the honey but in the really expensive cut-off section
C	it was like fifty pound honey and then like I'd be like oh there's a pawn
D	bit of plastic in there
C	there's a chess piece in there or there's a balloon grip
D	I don't know if it comes from some old good luck thing but they're just chucking shitty bits of plastic in it

C	yeah
D	which we've treated ourselves to a few
C	we can't believe how much chocolate bars and packs of crisps have gone up
D	yeah
C	you'd swear it was thirty-five P when we left and now it's seventy P standard
D	if you go in a newsagents or a Co-op it's like seventy P or sixty P for a chocolate bar
C	but if you go in Aldi it's still thirty-three P
D	still thirty-three P
C	like it used to
D	weird isn't it?
A	weird innit?

D	they do it for a pound in the check Chocolate Orange
C	is it a quid though?
D	I mean we've only bought them twice but we make them last like four days

A	are we walking from here or driving from here?
D	we're gonna walk first to the second hand big one
A	yeah yeah

B	antiquey one
D	and then we're gonna come back and then we're gonna drive to the charity shops
B	where is it?
D	yeah
B	different in the oh mind you that is five o'clock in the morning

B	yeah
D	yeah
B	it is changing
D	it's not gonna last much longer
B	it's gonna change this weekend
A	yeah
C	it's lovely at the minute
B	the jet the jet streams move in
D	the Gulf Stream?
B	is it the Gulf Stream?
D	yeah the jet stream
B	or one or the other I thought there was a jet stream as well though isn't there?
D	from a jet
A	only when you're in a jet
B	no I'm sure it's
C	it didn't sound wrong to me so I'm not sure
D	no it doesn't yeah yeah
B	I'm sure they said it was the jet the jet stream
A	zoom what was that? jet stream
B	yeah it's
B	it's been going above Scotland
D	oh yeah
B	and it's come down
D	yeah that's a different stream
B	and
A	Ryanair
C	cos that's what keeps us warm the Gulf Stream
D	yeah yeah there's there's a different stream we're talking about
C	we're on the same line of longitude as like frozen other parts of the world so if we didn't have that our winters would be like minus ten minus twenty like consistently
D	they're not they're damp
C	but it could happen they've found in history that the Gulf Stream has reversed
D	it's gone it reverses every X amount of thousands of years so at any point it could just plunge us into the worst winter ever
B	the ice age again
C	yeah
B	there was an ice age
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	there was definitely an ice age I don't know if yeah
C	what's crazy there's a tipping point in the ice age as well
D	yeah yeah once some once it's
C	once it gets below about middle of France
D	yeah then that's that's
C	the whole world will freeze
D	the whole world will freeze
C	so there'll be an ice age
D	yeah
C	we've had it before where it's come down about so far and then it's still kinda hot in the equator but if it gets down to about southern France so I've heard
D	mm then it's chilled the world enough to the the whole world really
C	the world's cold enough the world will freeze over
B	bit like that erm film
C	yeah
D	The Day After Tomorrow
C	well I was thinking
A	when I have a lager oh when it comes on
C	I was thinking I was thinking Ice Age
C	not not Ice Age
D	you've gotta have a whisky dad
B	there was a film I think it was The Day After Tomorrow
C	yeah
B	where it just
C	the day before The Day After Tomorrow
D	alright alright gonna need another wee anyway
B	and er
C	I'd better head back then hadn't i?
D	yeah you'll get lots of work done today I'll get nothing nothing
C	there you go shall I pause this now then?
D	no give it another
C	I'll just leave it
D	second yeah while
B	I mean it's still crazy that there was that you know dinosaurs wasn't there?
C	yeah
D	yeah there were dinosaurs quite a few of them
C	what's crazy is there still are
B	and how many millions of years they existed for
A	instead of being walking about now
C	then poof
B	yeah
C	gone
B	they died
C	although today we still kind of have I mean a crocodile is effectively a dinosaur
D	they're prehistoric
C	they're perfectly evolved they were around at the same time they grow up to like seven or eight metres in length in the sea which is like three or four times the length of your dad they're pretty big
D	just with a bit sharper teeth
C	yeah
B	what's that alligators?
C	yeah crocodiles salt water crocodiles they're dinosaurs effectively
B	crocodiles yeah
C	mm mm
D	mm mm mm
B	well they think some of the fish in the ocean is prehistoric as well
C	yeah
B	don't they?
D	oh yeah no
C	but they don't need to evolve anymore
D	no yeah
C	they're perfectly suited to their environment it's all good
D	what did whales evolve from? cos they're massive
C	they were sea creatures that came out onto the land and then went back into the sea
D	and then went back into the sea yeah
B	whales?
C	hence why they breathe
D	yeah
B	oh and they're mammals
C	yeah mammals in the sea will have come out of the sea and gone back in the sea
D	it's probably also why they're
C	theoretically it's
D	I mean maybe not why but they're incredibly intelligent as well so
C	yeah
D	that crossing over
C	you may have found that they never truly left the sea
D	yeah yeah
C	they just kind of were a bit land sea-based and then kind of went back in
D	yeah they are really
B	ladies running around
C	do you know there are
D	yeah you get worried about a centipede coming towards you imagine a bloody whale coming down
C	if you think how inland
D	those little legs
C	how inland Russia is there's no sea in the middle of Russia or anywhere near it there are dolphins in one of their biggest lakes there because of where the sea used to be connected where the sea level was much higher
C	where it was sea that far inland
B	yeah
C	and there are dolphins in the lake
D	yeah this I mean this lake is huge
C	it's huge lake
D	but it's very far from the ocean
C	yeah
D	and it's got all kinds of species of animals hidden in it
C	it's massive it's about as far from the ocean as you can be but there are dolphins in it
B	you ever been to Russia?
D	no no we'd love to go
C	well we went through Moscow on the way home
D	oh we did we did very very briefly running
C	yeah we were that was horrible
B	ah
D	in the end we went past we ran past all the people on our flight and basically pushed in front of the queue
C	we were the first on the plane
D	we thought we were late
B	mind you that was like the first time we flew to Italy wasn't it? when we when we
D	yeah went to
B	via Amsterdam and we only had a very small window
D	and mum was guiding us cos I was a child
B	yeah so that was the first time either of us had flown
D	flown and we we were standing on the side of this glass banging on a window
D	so we were on the other side
C	how old were you?
D	er ten eleven
D	yeah yeah I told you my mum got on the conveyor belt with the suitcase

D	so as it got near the end she jumped on and grabbed it off
C	incinerator
B	and it wasn't even
D	no
B	well one bloke said well that was close or something didn't he? or that was lucky
D	I don't remember that bit I just remember being horribly embarrassed
C	after you weren't sucked in there
D	yeah
C	you'd have got lost with the baggage
A	yeah could have done
D	we laughed about that for some time clearly
B	and at the end
D	ten years later no fifteen years
B	and that suitcase was still there as well at the end
D	yeah
B	wasn't it? it wasn't claimed
D	and my one wasn't didn't come through
B	and your
D	that looked like it
C	is that the only time that's happened?
D	er yeah lost our suitcase
C	if we knew that we weren't gonna get our suitcases this time I knew it I knew it
D	yeah there was a feeling it's cos our connection was too short

C	I'm not sure I get it
D	it's alright it's an in
C	did I miss the punchline?
