B	oh
C	twenty-fourth of the fourth in
D	er some of us are
A	I can't see in this light
D	how can chicken tikka masala
A	I won the raffle
D	only be four hundred and fifty calories?
A	that's what I was thinking
B	must be like
C	don't get too excited
A	it's it's quite big and especially if you go large
E	can you please tell me how every raffle you seem to go into at the minute you win but we win jack shit for the Lottery
C	perhaps you need to buy the ticket face to face
E	okay
C	must be what it is
E	can you please buy the ticket that's going to win
unknown_female	yeah
B	if it's discounted and you discount the calories as well
A	or well no that's it there he reckons if you go large and add the samosa and a large onion bhaji
D	mm
A	it's only two hundred and forty calories
C	that's and for the two extra bits of
D	it's
A	yeah
C	sweet potato which is rubbish cos a samosa cannot be two hundred calories
A	that's what I'm saying
B	no a samosa

A	I'm not sure if I'm gonna have the curry
C	the flaming dragon curry I'll have that
A	yeah
C	hot chicken curry and diced chicken breast red peppers curry
B	I also think that unless that bowl of chips is huge it's not gonna be
D	yeah
B	seven hundred and ninety-six calories
D	there are some quite worrying statistics on there both ways underestimates and overestimates aren't there?
B	yeah
A	I think the chips were a big bowl
B	that was absolutely huge and like deep fried three times to bring up the calories
A	I quite like the look of that pasta
C	which one?
D	it's that one
A	oh you get a drink as well
B	the superfood pasta
D	cos that looks ostensibly like I would be able to have it
A	oh she's starting already
C	yeah
D	that that's all free food isn't it?
C	yeah
D	yeah?
C	yeah
D	so I'm gonna try it cos then if I like it I can have it every night

A	but then
D	I might have it it's
A	do you not have your last supper and just try it next time?
B	the protein up
D	yeah
E	is that really bad to eat?

E	right
B	and fish and chips was four
E	right
B	and there was something else but I can't remember
E	that's good
B	so if you pop down to the bar you can have a look
C	I dunno there's just the steak here
B	and it's probably not the best thing to have
A	yeah
B	how do you cremate your steak?
unknown_female	she does
B	why? you're ruining it
A	because I can't eat it any other way
B	it's like eating an old boot

B	I think I just pick it up from wherever I am
D	yeah
B	and I haven't really picked up any

E	well that's a meal
A	a spa a spa day treatment and whoever wins the weigh-in on that night when they've got it gets that
A	so that's the incentive
C	they don't all go out for chips
