A	sorry my hands are like mostly clean
B	you should have said completely

E	two there but yeah
B	yeah cos I've had two
C	so
A	oh
C	and there's one left
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
E	shh
E	I did really bad maths earlier
E	what was it?
A	you thought that
E	two thousand and nine
A	you were like seventeen years ago
E	was seventeen years ago
E	yeah
C	you just thought it was nineteen ninety-nine that's all
E	yeah
B	yeah but still considering she was born in like
E	ninety-five and I'm twenty
B	yeah
E	it was bad maths it was
E	very illogical
B	are you a ninety-five baby?
E	what?
B	er I should have known that I suppose it's never twigged
E	yeah cos you're you're born what? six months after me
A	mm
E	and you're a ninety-five baby
B	I know but yeah
E	what did you think I was a ninety-four baby?
B	I think I don't I don't think I really thought about it but yeah probably
C	I figured you were ninety-five
E	yeah
A	ninety-five
E	oh yeah cos you're older than
B	she's twenty-five god
E	oh yeah
A	well
C	weird I don't know I just
C	don't know anymore I gave up
B	oh dear
A	erm I
C	didn't really think this through I've not really
E	I saw the struggle for your eyes then of
E	have to move
B	oh these are the sugar glasses aren't they?
C	I know you need to like step up
B	I thought we had four now
C	I thought we had three
E	no I've got three
B	oh
E	cos I haven't got one yet
B	that's not acceptable
C	no
E	I know
B	it's just no good
E	it's reopening on Wednesday
B	yeah
E	and there's like apparently a new sound system and everything
B	oh right
C	they have wi-fi
E	I know
B	yes
E	this is really sad
C	this is so exciting you can communicate with people
B	what gets me though is that they spent forty thousand pound or something ridiculous over the summer of redoing it
C	but why didn't they do this before? why didn't
B	it's so that
C	why did they wait for it to flood
B	mm
C	to do this?
B	like all the cos all the stuff that they did for the forty thousand pound was nothing compared to
C	yeah
B	what they've just done because it flooded which I get they had to redo it but
C	yeah
E	cos they added like a Jager bar
A	mm I didn't
E	who cares about Jager Bomb bar?
A	realise like how badly that end of town had flooded
B	no
E	so badly
A	like by the station all the shops down like as you walk down to Sainsbury's all like those
B	mm
A	going down
B	well I saw some photos of
A	mm
B	yeah
E	all the shops near like the pharmacy you know around that corner that was all like a
B	it's ridiculous I still haven't got over the fact that the flooded like when you think how high
C	I know cos there's like
B	the banks are
B	yeah
C	you stand there and it's like really far away but
E	when you think about it it's really lucky that like the pharmacy is up steps
B	mm
E	cos that would have been
B	mm
E	had to chuck out
E	uhu
B	and apparently Sainsbury's was giving away free food which I didn't realise
E	mm
B	we missed out
E	I know
C	I know
E	there were so many like pubs and stuff giving out free food as well
A	mm
B	they set up a thing er down in
E	did they?
B	like a little food van yeah giving away free food
E	instead we cooked pasta under four candles
E	literally candlelight of four
C	did you actually?
E	forty
B	with with the candles
E	four no like on the hob
B	we had four candles lit
E	but like with the light of forty lights
C	oh
B	we came were going downstairs and we were like oh it's so bright
A	wait you were you using the heat from
B	no no no no we had the hob on
A	oh
C	they were just seeing
E	the hob's gas
C	by four candles
E	yeah we was seeing by
A	I see I see
E	although the people who lived in
A	well that's like impossible
E	I don't think it worked probably
E	they were trying to make toast
B	you can get camping toasters which I think are quite clever and they're just like little metal things that you put at an angle next to the erm flame
E	they didn't have one of those
B	was that I was talking to
C	if they had like a camping stove
B	mm
C	you're sorted though
B	it's like when I was talking to
E	mm
C	this is the problem like have one but
B	people who are planning on going camping?
C	it's in
B	my family does
C	well I say I have one dad bought it as well
E	my mum went through a phase and she literally she
B	yeah the one one of the ones that does like ten litres?
E	went camping once didn't use any of the stuff
B	we should go camping when it's warm
A	I'd like to go
C	mm
E	and then
E	we've had it for six years
B	maybe you should take your mum camping
E	she don't even like camping doesn't wanna go
B	my mum's gone off camping she used to like it but
C	yeah my mum refuses to go camping now it's rained on us too many times
A	mm but er you need nice weather
C	and a tent that doesn't leak
E	mm erm we went as practice for Nicaragua
A	we went to the Peak District to practice to go to
A	I froze
C	I can imagine
E	I camped through Africa when we went that was like intense
C	mm
E	and there was
E	and I like was kind of half awake and I was like I could go outside and help her but then they'll just be two of us that are wet
E	so I stayed inside and then I found a mosquito and a moth and freaked out and I was like
E	like okay
B	we made it like a game for the kids at camp over summer cos
E	I thought it was Botticelli but we googled it and Botticelli's a different thing
B	yeah no I thought it was I'm trying
E	that's feels like twenty questions
B	oh is it?
E	yeah
B	I dunno is it not just like? I dunno but my friend's told me about this really good game that we have to start playing well sounds quite like it could be quite funny it's called hats and basically you put
A	uhu
B	put it in a hat and then erm
B	anyway so this one we'd all choose like a person
B	you pick one of them out of a hat and then you have to describe it and you can have as many words as you want and it's like Taboo or Articulate
A	mm
B	and then everything goes back in the hat
E	I'm confused
A	would there would there be like four names if there's four of us?
B	I think so
E	wait so everyone puts one name in a hat
B	yeah
E	of a celebrity or a character
B	yeah
E	and then you pick another name out
B	uhu
E	and you've got to make people guess
B	what it is yeah
A	mm
C	yeah as soon as you say like one thing
A	mm
C	they'll know because they'll be like oh that's the one I wrote
B	interesting I don't know
E	oh you know what we should do?
E	we should put names of celebrities in hats and then we should pick one out and you should have to
B	and feel like this
E	no and then everyone should have to act like their character
B	that only works if you know who they are
A	mm
B	well I've got headbands not headbands had er to do it on my phone which has got like names of people
E	but like so you've got to like so like you put like obvious people and like Sherlock Holmes or like Dr Who and you've got to act like that person like put an accent on and say what they would say and get people to guess what it is
A	they don't really have accents well they don't for me but they do for you I guess
B	what?
A	like
E	Peter Capaldi does though
A	yeah
B	I'm not that skilled a actor
A	no
E	well
B	what do you want?
E	the drink please
B	erm what was the other one? the other was I feel like
E	that makes me suspicious
E	of what you're about to say
B	you all put a erm a name in a hat okay and it's like a celebrity or a character or whatever and erm
A	I can see why you think
E	so that's like would you rather?
B	yeah and then er whichever one you say you would pick you put back in the hat and then whichever one you you wouldn't you take out and then so you keep
E	wait say that again say that again
B	so whichever one you say you'd married put back in the hat and the other one you take out and then you keep going and whichever one is left in the hat at the end the person that wrote that one down wins
C	that's a
E	I was like that might be difficult
C	so the point is like write down
A	I know
E	and then you win
E	we should play that
A	he looks like a potato
C	or just find the celebrity now you must sleep with them
E	he doesn't look like a potato
A	he does look like a potato
C	who looks like a potato?
E	no he's not that attractive
C	he does not look like a potato
A	he looks like a potato
C	he does not
A	he does
B	I started watching Twilight with er my mum it's hilarious

B	I know but it just made everyone look a bit mm
A	mm
B	it wasn't that funny either
E	erm there was some funny jokes
B	I think my favourite jokes was the the bit with the goat

B	and she's like
A	oh
B	oh I know the answer to this one it's goat

A	I've read the Cloud Atlas
E	have you read it?
B	oh did you?

B	I can't really remember what happened to be honest I remember seeing the bit with the
A	right it took me a while to remember who was the musician
B	but I I saw that coming
A	mm
B	erm
A	I really liked how like they all linked together
B	mm
A	yeah there's the
B	oh yeah
A	and then the composer and then the one about the like nuclear power thing
B	oh yeah
A	and then the old people's home and then the one that's set like
B	and like
A	in
B	yeah
A	and then the random one that I skipped cos it was boring and then it goes back

A	I don't know it was like about
B	was that not the guy in New Zealand?
A	no
A	I
A	I don't really know like I read the first couple of pages and I was like this is boring
B	the guy
A	and his like dad and his brother die
E	that sounds horrible
B	I kind of want I
A	well I did and then I looked it up on IMDB and apparently there's loads of like blood and stuff in it so I'm like no

A	mm
B	so
A	mm like the titles and stuff
B	maybe I'm thinking of a different book though
A	are you thinking of erm like the Chaos Walking books?

A	cos those ones change font between
B	mm
A	like Todd and Viola which is really really irritating

A	the
B	yeah that's the word
A	yeah I like it as well
B	not
E	no punctuation? sounds like the most

E	awkward thing to read
A	but it's like written how somebody would speak it
E	no
A	no it's
E	maybe you have to've seen it
C	stuff is spelt phonetically

E	oh no we had specific handwriting pens
A	was it like the red?
B	yeah we did
E	yeah
A	yeah the
B	we did for the handwriting so I was allowed to use my fountain pen
E	oh well we didn't get to use them until year five
B	I hated pencil like even though I hate writing in pencil like having to do maths in pencil was how to draw the super S
E	uhu
A	oh yeah
B	yeah I think that's it
C	did you find out when the relativity worksheet is in for?
B	er no I got distracted again
C	right
C	I'll do it
C	I'm on it
A	I remember when we were allowed like when we were in year six we were allowed to bring in pencil cases and it was a massive deal
B	we used to take in pencil cases I used to have a school bag and I don't know why cos there was never anything in it
B	like I I yeah
B	cos literally like you
C	why is that so funny?
C	oh yeah it's
E	you taking in an empty bag
B	well we used to like
B	and
B	it's like that's like it and then it came to have like one school book
A	did you not have take like a reading book?
B	yeah I used to do that
B	I gave up on school reading though
A	I was a free reader on reception
B	were you? I was put on free reading in
E	what?
B	like from reception upwards? or just in reception?
A	in well yeah and and
B	oh really? we had to do full reading books
E	in reception?
A	yeah I could read when I went to school
B	we didn't have reading books in reception I don't think
C	what?
B	I could read when I went to school
E	what?
E	literally I I was we were like we did
B	I think I might probably I don't know if I
E	we did like words and
A	yeah
E	putting sentences together in reception we didn't start doing reading books until year two
B	apparently I got in a strop cos you know when they like when you first learn to read they give you books that are like focusing on one word? they were all focusing on the word look and apparently I got like my third one opened it and like
B	no I used to hate it cos they used to make me read like school books and they were so boring
A	mm
B	I got put on free reading in like year three? yeah cos I know in year three four and then I moved up to year four and I was put back on reading books and my mum went to see the head teacher or a teacher and she was like well no this was in year two my mum went to see a teacher and she was like well why is
A	mm
B	Harry Potter and whatever and
A	mm
B	basically went well it's not fair to the other children if I put her up
A	what?
B	I know
E	I didn't put on free reading until I was in like year five year six
B	I think I
E	it wasn't like they didn't like just move you onto it like you had to
B	mm
E	you'd go onto the next section
B	yeah I just gave up
E	so it was just like
B	and it got to the stage where I'd read in year five I think I read one book every month or something for school and then
A	mm
B	I brought a scrubbing brush back for the dishes it's a duck duck
C	that was
B	it's cos I was on my phone and there's like a ladybird toothpaste holder which I think is quite cute and we've got
B	cos I was thinking about my duck toothbrush holder
A	oh
B	er it's like a loch ness
E	loch ness monster
B	monster and we need one
A	oh yeah well it looks like you know like a brontosaurus
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	is it brontosaurus? I thought they were brachiosauruses
A	brachiosaurus whichever one I don't know I don't know
B	if well we need one especially if we're gonna make soup
A	they are very cute I like them
B	cos we don't actually have a ladle we decided we needed a ladle and we'll need a ladle
B	for er mango vodka as well because it's in the pot
C	oh is that what that is?
B	yeah
E	yeah
C	I wondered
E	mm
C	the worksheet is in for eleven
E	oh
B	okay please will you have a look and then it shouldn't take too long I think I've done
E	where's my laptop?
A	oh it's
B	we moved them so they don't get covered in pizza
E	oh

A	mm
B	it's that
C	er thanks when are we gonna take the tree down?
E	we're not
A	are we not?
A	after the after the Christmas meal
C	oh okay that's
A	well no me and
C	I know but it's bad luck
B	oh I brought I brought another ping pong ball
A	oh to replace the angel's head?
B	yeah I don't know how bouncy it is but it was twenty-five P in pick and pay
E	well I think we've got a spare one as well
A	yeah we've got two yeah
E	cos it came with two
B	yeah
A	no no that's

C	shall we just use the owl one?
E	yeah
B	is there enough for me to wrap up my friend's Christmas present as well?
A	yeah probably
B	yeah
A	I was gonna say no the table one and then I was like no it is box I'm sad that I actually need them to take my stuff back at the end of the year
B	well we won't
A	so we can't use them anymore
A	I know but it's the end of an era
B	maybe you can resurrect them next year
A	mm could do
E	that's really sad don't wanna talk about that
B	they can be in the Skype videos
B	yeah no in the foreground I don't wanna see you
B	I have a two one one workshop
E	oh I want those
C	if you don't want that
A	yeah
B	I suppose so they have a star next to they'll have a star next to some of them
A	what is it?
E	shoes
A	oh
B	and the word simplify and a question mark next to it
B	oh nice
A	my one was like that long
C	yeah mine's like just fits on the page
B	and I've written the word simplify next to it but I don't want to look at it and try and simplify it
A	yeah I know
B	I think I tried by the looks of it
C	cos it's got Es and like signs and causes
B	yeah
C	so you'd think
A	I literally
C	I just
A	hate signs and causes
B	I know
C	I signed it thank you
E	I hate
B	yeah
E	I mean and
C	did you have a weird graph?
B	I didn't
A	damn
B	I I had to look up
B	how to put invert cot into my calculator
C	is it not a function?
B	yeah
C	like
E	yeah no it's definitely a function
B	it's it's not a it's not a function on my
A	yeah
C	calculator
C	oh right
A	but you need to get a new calculator
B	like
E	yeah
A	get one like me and
E	yeah
E	you can borrow mine if you want
E	I mean I'll probably need it for tomorrow
E	for my quantum mechanics but
E	yeah you can borrow it
B	I don't think I've brought my
C	I didn't see you with it but I wasn't really paying attention
A	did your korfball top arrive?
B	my korfball top?
A	yeah
B	yeah I had it before the holidays
A	oh did you?
B	yeah
A	what number did you go for in the end?
B	fifty-four
A	fifty-four
B	and I've got one capital
E	what do you mean capitals?
B	my surname
E	oh you just do V to start with
B	I could have had the whole thing in capitals
E	but that's not right that's grammatically
E	incorrect
B	on the back like on the back of her top
A	oh
B	no on the back of my top
B	not just in live
C	yeah just in general always put it all in capitals
E	yeah once someone reads it then it's like fifty-four
B	no a lot of people on sports tops do their name in capitals
E	no
A	no they do that's like a thing
C	yeah
B	but it looks weird
A	yeah
B	for
B	yeah
A	like
E	like
A	you have to do the
B	I want to sit with my legs crossed
C	sit down here
B	I'm not not allowed I will in a second
B	I'm not allowed to sit with my legs crossed
C	why not?
A	I feel like a whale or a dolphin
C	cos they make them all wonky
B	that's
B	yeah apparently when she hit forty
A	and I was telling her parents about how you called me a horse
A	and they were like that's actually really bad cos the thoroughbreds are really stupid
A	and it's like
B	this is reports
C	oh okay
C	have you typed it up?
B	yeah
C	that's really something
B	and then this was me trying to
A	oh
B	understand relativity
C	mm
B	which actually I should probably give this back cos I didn't realise it had stuff in it
C	what is it?
B	I think it's my mum's bank statement she might want this
E	yeah don't steal that from her
B	it'll be like oh no I've got that oops
B	okay this is as far as I got with drawing a diagram for
C	yeah
B	no that one that one
C	that's that's like what you want you just erm yeah no
B	yeah
C	that's like air and then maybe putting the angle in but I'm not really sure if they want an angle
E	yeah they definitely want the angle
B	I've worked out the angle
C	yeah what did you get?
A	I did the angle
E	yeah same
B	I got forty point nine
C	that's what I got
B	from your the vertical
C	so I I put I put that I just put an angle on it just because
B	okay
C	it's more information but yeah I think question one just wants like the axes and that's about it
B	and then question two I have answers for all of it except D I think
E	do you want the D though?
C	I need the D
E	well then let's find the D
B	right and the question 4C when asked why it's heavier than it was before what's the answer?
C	it
B	a hat
A	too much Christmas pudding
C	it went through a collision and like stuff happened
B	erm I've got kinetic energy is not conserved in a in inelastic collision so it was converted to heat energy which increases the mass in relativity why does it increase the mass?
C	yeah no that's that's basically it
E	cos if you go in a collision you get emotional scarring and
E	fill fill that emotional scarring void
B	with food
E	with food
B	yeah
C	and also you can get condensation and it makes your pockets heavier
B	true
C	so then they buy more food eat more food and they go etcetera
B	do people beep who have like
B	hips?
E	beep
C	yeah
E	who have what?
B	hips
A	do people who beep who have hips?
B	yes
A	I know what you mean
C	I know yeah
A	I don't know
B	replacement was the word I was looking for
E	can't take that off
A	exactly
B	no I never why understand why bras don't beep
C	it's a really low amount
A	yeah
B	amount of er I dunno
B	yeah but still
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I dunno my belt always beeps
E	but like the zip on your jeans though
A	they make they make you take your belt off don't they?
B	mm?
C	yeah true
E	no they don't anymore
B	they do
C	they do
E	they never make me take
C	your belt and your shoes
A	they made my dad take his belt off and it's like
C	yeah
A	he had to put it in the little box thing
E	well I always get to keep my belt on and my shoes
E	never make me take mine
C	I guess it depends on the belt
B	it depends on what shoes you've got
C	and the shoes yeah
B	yeah it depends what
C	yeah
B	shoes you're wearing
A	I don't think there's any of these that
E	there's no way they could possibly know that
A	when the rest of
B	cos I I
E	oh
E	shots fired
B	I had to take my walking boots off but that's fair enough cos they're quite
C	yeah
B	like chunky and
E	no I went when I came up from Africa I had my walking boots on cos they were the only shoes that stayed together
C	coming back they're not fussy though are they?
B	they can be
C	they're normally as
E	no it was it was cos it wasn't like
C	though
E	a direct flight
C	oh okay

B	erm I've gone erm
E	cos you've still got to go onto the
B	moving my
E	like you've still getting onto the flight and you've got to go through
B	to
A	they don't know make you go through like scanning stuff on the way back
B	yeah
E	yeah

A	yeah yeah
E	but when you go
B	do you want me to make
A	oh right when they've gone
C	it's okay
A	change thing
E	no so like if I'm in France and I'm coming back
A	yeah
E	to the UK
B	the French airport make you
A	yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
E	the French airport make you go through security
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry I thought you

B	but I looked last year and cos I like was ill all the time I wasn't allowed and it was like oh you can't have had a sore throat in the last two years or well that's
C	two years?
C	well then there's no chance
B	last two weeks there was no chance of me being able to do it right physics and then we can play pub quiz
A	yay
E	oh oh does it count towards your grade?
B	yeah
C	well like a tiny bit
B	well it's
B	it'll be fifty percent of the coursework
C	yeah or
B	for one module
B	true but it still brings your average down
C	the coursework bit
B	if you fail
C	yeah but it's like the
E	it's like the third of an eighth
C	it's even smaller than that
E	of the yeah
C	it'll be tiny
E	but it still matters
C	doing it for ages I gave up
A	yeah you wanna like do as well as you can before the exam
E	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah and the better you do this year
E	you get as many marks as you can
B	the worse you can do in third and fourth year
E	yeah
B	for question three
C	that's one way of looking at it
B	I remember you were the only one talking about this cos finally understand what a light cone is
A	okay good
B	cos I like cos when I actually read through the notes it's like oh
C	yeah
B	that makes sense did you get that it's not being observed and never will be?
C	yeah I think so
A	I got that as well
E	I disagree
B	well done
E	you can't say something will never happen
B	why?
E	cos you can't see into the future
B	it's physics
E	no
B	yeah
E	no
B	yeah
E	no
B	yeah
E	no
B	do you know what a light cone is? do you understand how physics works?
E	yeah

C	it's the cone in which light er
B	no no more alcohol for you
B	well
E	high on something
C	or something

A	I don't think I'll like them
A	he thought it was so sad that I didn't like them
B	oh
C	before I was growling but now I'm just like
B	physics
B	right I'm going to go to the loo and then finish this worksheet and then we're gonna play pub quiz
A	if you need print it
C	can I go to bed now?
B	no
C	oh please
