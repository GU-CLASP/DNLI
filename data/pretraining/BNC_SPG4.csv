A	yeah it's lovely
B	yeah
A	oh lovely

B	you've got oh you've got some?
A	yes I've got some thank you
B	okay mm
A	I don't know mum doesn't really like them much
B	oh perhaps it's your mum then
A	well she likes them in salad but she doesn't like them in sauces
B	oh no I quite them cooked
A	mm
B	tomatoes
A	me too
B	yes and are you brown bread fan or a white bread fan?
A	mm brown bread
B	yeah
A	white bread doesn't have enough flavour for me
B	no
A	I don't know how people eat it
B	no it's really completely different
A	just tastes bland to me this
B	totally different totally different yeah
A	mm nice bread
B	this is cooked locally
A	oh right mm mm
B	mm
A	he did mm that's right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	very very little she'd eat
A	that's right she didn't eat much
B	yeah
A	think she had a well had a sensitive stomach though that's more why wasn't it?
B	er what? oh probably yeah
A	mm
B	yes very nice very good yeah
A	mm
B	what's that?
A	small fish like sardines
B	doesn't she like those?
A	no they don't like anchovies oh but I love anchovies do you like them?
B	I like sardines yeah
A	mm and anchovies I like too
A	any of any of those small fish that come in cans I love those
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah er in fact even now when I get a breakfast nearly always order fish
A	oh right yes well they've got such great flavour those small fish haven't they?
B	yeah yeah yeah very nice
A	in Spain I used to get fresh sardines a lot and in the Middle East
B	oh yeah
A	cos here you can't buy them fresh much
B	no I just remembered when you said yeah
A	they come in cans don't they more?
B	when you said south Spain I've still got the smell of those things
A	oh delicious
B	being cooked as you walk by you can smell it yeah
A	oh wonderful no that's funny because dad will eat pretty much anything in the UK but he's very difficult when he's abroad
B	yeah
A	and I hadn't realised that cos I thought well fish is fish isn't it you know? and we went
B	no
A	he wouldn't even try it and it was things like fresh sardines no sauce you know cos they don't like sauces and I can understand that
B	I I used to love that in Spain yeah
A	but it's just grilled with salt that's it but you wouldn't eat them
B	yeah marvellous
A	oh I loved them yeah absolutely lovely yeah I cooked them for myself in the Middle East I'd buy them cos they're incredibly cheap
B	can you?
A	you know you can buy you know
B	well yes were you on the coastline there were you? I've forgotten
A	mm
B	yeah
A	Abu Dhabi's on the coast mm
B	oh yeah
A	yeah I loved those fish
B	yeah
A	you can get herrings here fresh they're a bit like sardines
A	mm they're
B	yeah
A	put them on the grill six minutes
B	and it's done yeah
A	done fantastic
B	but I
A	mm
B	though I
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but grilled fish is a nice easy one
B	yeah yeah
A	to do you don't need to do anything with it just a bit of salad
B	no
A	and you're fine
B	and and
A	that that's nice
B	that's quite good
A	mm delicious
B	mm do you buy them at home?
A	mm yeah and anchovies as well
A	mm mm
B	just like
A	mm
B	I don't expect your mum bothered about that did she fish on Fridays?
A	no but she did often do fish and chips on Fridays
B	on right did she? oh that was the that was the standard there
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	what did mum use to say?
A	yes that
B	I think our friend used to
A	mm
B	on the way back I suppose
A	mm
B	back of the car with fish and chips
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah I don't like fish and chip chop fish that much I find the batter too heavy
B	yeah I enjoy the batter yeah
A	like today that was lovely cos it was very light
B	light yeah
A	that's the only way I can really eat it
B	no you see
A	I find fish and chips they're so greasy the chips now
B	yeah they're so thick they er they're covered up very little fish inside
A	yeah that's right so today that was how I like it but
B	yeah yeah
A	that's pretty much the only way I'll have it now
B	cos I think breakfast is very good for people I think breakfast is very good for
A	mm
B	I haven't
A	oh right mm
B	what's it called now? oh not a big concern erm oh oh I've forgotten the name of the I've taken
A	mm
B	gor forgotten his name
A	oh right
B	yeah right
A	mm
B	must've been quite good
A	I think you should get a membership card for the
B	oh
A	you're probably single-handedly keeping it open
B	yeah yeah that's right yes er no they're good for
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it's a nice setting too
B	oh yeah
A	that makes a big difference actually the setting
B	oh you mean like you mean the one outside the town do you mean? yeah
A	the
B	the
A	mm
B	yeah in in the town yeah
A	it's nice and quiet and light in there though isn't it? it's not noisy
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes that's nice
B	but
A	no
B	no no yeah
A	mm
B	er young
A	oh really?
B	the one in
A	oh
B	yeah
B	oh he does like his food yeah
A	we all like our food don't we?
B	mm
A	and do you cook much? not much? what do you cook?
B	well I might grill fish cos that's easy
A	yes it is easy and it's nice
B	yeah
A	it's very you just nice simple meal
A	healthy too isn't it?
B	and the other way of course I if I'm going into
A	yes it's that's nice what do you do for breakfast?
B	oh breakfast yeah
A	cereal? or you don't get up for breakfast?
B	no I normally oh normally toast I usually have toast
A	yes I have toast a lot for breakfast yes I'm the same
B	toast and butter
A	I
B	a
A	mm yes that's a nice breakfast
B	I'm not
A	yeah well it's very good for you actually
B	yeah yeah I don't
A	better than milk they say it's easier to digest that's probably why grandma liked it
B	is it? oh grandma was
A	I make my own
B	do you?
A	yes
B	oh I don't I don't drink that very often well at least I can't remember doing it
A	I just have a small cup every day I try to have a small
B	well a little tiny one
A	yeah yeah a little tiny one not a huge thing
B	oh no oh well
A	except sardines
B	oh except sardines you say?
A	he won't he won't eat small fish
B	oh
A	and he hates seeing fish with their heads on that really puts him off
B	oh I I always find well I always tend to chop the heads off when I'm in there yeah
B	definitely at the fish counter
A	but actually if you're grilling them whole it's quite useful to have the heads on
B	is it? oh
A	yes cos then when you lift the tail bone out the whole thing comes off
B	oh I see
A	but you want them to gut it really that's the fiddly job
B	well what the like er when I go to Morrison's in town for those fish fresh fish
A	mm
B	they do that for me chop the heads off and then clean it out
A	ah yes that's useful though
B	yeah
A	er descaling and the
B	yeah they do that
A	and the gutting cos that's just messy
B	yeah
A	and you're not gonna use that for anything
B	no Morrison's quite good for their fish
A	mm but I find leaving the heads on is quite useful if if you're grilling them whole
B	better
A	cos they don't fall apart on you
B	no never fancy eating the heads though do you?
A	yeah oh I don't eat them no I just
B	gonna say
A	just when you when they're done the
B	yeah
A	bend it a bit then the whole thing comes off with the spine so
B	oh
A	just lift the the meat off
B	oh you're well into cooking I can see
A	mm fish is nice cos it's simple
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no not really
A	I mean you can't it's difficult to undercook fish you'd have to try quite hard
B	try hard enough to go before you
A	yes
B	occasionally I've burnt them under the grill
A	yes I think the
B	yeah
A	so you just need to stand there really
B	yeah
A	not go off cos you're really looking only at six minutes for a lot of those smaller fish
B	no I know
A	and you can't really I mean there aren't that many things you could do with fish are there? you either grill it
B	yeah I don't
A	or you can poach it which I never do
B	when I've got fish in there I know there's something wrong when I see smoke in the air
A	oh dear whereas meat it's harder cos you know it's different thickness and you
B	yeah
A	yeah so I don't like cooking meat very much
B	no meat
A	mm I don't eat much meat
B	I don't I I don't I don't ever get meat actually I don't think
B	I used to have beef I I haven't had beef for years now
A	yeah no I don't eat much of it at all
B	well I had duck occasionally yeah
A	oh that's nice mm I'll eat duck out quite a lot
B	oh oh oh do you? yes
A	I've never cooked it though I should do really
B	yes
A	used to be difficult to buy but it's not any more
B	no no you can you can buy the duck
A	mm
B	in in most of the supermarkets years years ago of course
A	oh that's nice
B	I think they must've gone bust though cos they they suddenly vanished
A	mm that's a shame
B	yeah
A	I love shellfish I love them
B	yeah
A	do you like them?
B	they're quite nice yeah yeah
A	mm I don't buy them but it is nice
B	cockles
A	the only thing I don't like is whelks cos they look like snails
B	oh those
A	that's don't like anything that looks like snails
B	oh no
A	they're a fiddle to eat as well that's no good
B	where did we eat where I saw fish like that?
A	shellfish is popular in northern Spain and not very expensive there don't see it that much here do you?
B	no I don't I don't like that
A	which I've never understood cos actually it's easy to farm and that's why it's cheap in Spain so in Spain they'll have these rafts just wooden rafts and from the raft they would hang ropes down like proper
B	yeah
A	you know the old-fashioned ropes you would see and on those ropes you know they might have
B	yeah
A	six foot by six foot maybe ten foot by ten foot they would put I don't know what they're called like the eggs of the muscles and they'd they'd impregnate it and then you leave it there and after six weeks it would be full of muscles
B	yeah
A	you scrape them off and you start again so it's incredibly cheap for them to farm you don't need to feed them they're just in the sea I've never understood why we didn't do that in the UK
B	I don't know talking of fish in Spain I remember the smell used to be marvellous going in Spain
A	mm yeah amazing
B	the fish you could smell it being cooked cooked outside they were cooking it like yeah
A	mm yeah beautiful the nice thing about Spanish cooking is unlike the French the French dress things up a lot
B	yeah
A	the Spanish don't bother they just start with very very good fresh local ingredients whatever's in season you can't buy things out of season and they just grill it and that's it salt
B	yeah
A	just with salt and a bit of maybe a bit of salad and that's it nothing else and it's just delicious
A	mm that's nice
A	yeah and a glass of wine and you're done
B	well that's that's useful to have around
A	yes
B	yeah
A	just if you've got good ingredients you shouldn't need to do much more than grill it and boil it bit of salad and that's pretty much it perfect meal
A	mm can be heavy though cos erm you know cream sauces can be quite heavy if you're not used to it
B	right yeah mm
A	like seafood soups
B	seafood yeah yeah
A	mm yes they do that well
B	and we went went with
A	mm
B	I remember the people were very good when we went over there yeah
A	mm
B	and we met up with
A	oh in Rhone? mm
B	yeah Rhone I think yeah
A	yes do you like Italian food?
B	well if you ask me do I prefer Italian food to English food no I prefer English food
A	these pears are nice very ripe
B	oh nice are they? yeah yeah
A	mm delicious
B	yes pear is a nice fruit
A	mm
B	I did well we've got a pear tree here somewhere
A	mm
B	the trouble is I think the birds have usually got them before me
A	yeah and the birds peck at them don't they? it's annoying with them cos the apples they don't like as much do they? but the pears they love the pears cos they're softer
B	yeah but the pears
A	mm yeah that's annoying I suppose the only thing you can do is net them isn't it? but then that's a pain
B	oh yes we used to net them years ago
A	that is all you can do
B	I don't know if you remember here I used to have a fruit cage
A	mm I remember that for the berries yeah
B	yeah yeah all the strawberries and also the raspberries and er blackcurrants and redcurrants and whitecurrants
A	yeah I remember that
B	yeah I suppose er I suppose they went out of use I suppose I haven't bothered with it
A	mm but I think the trees got too big as well didn't they? so they shaded it out
A	mm
B	oh they used to have quite a lot of food there one time
A	mm
B	yeah
A	delicious I did yeah mm yeah I like them
B	is that largely a Spanish food?
A	sorry?
B	Spanish? is it because those that type of fish?
A	yes they have sardines a lot that's very popular
A	fresh sardines
B	yeah that's what you smell everywhere
A	yes that's what you smell yes that's very typical particularly northern Spain or Galicia
A	that's very very popular yeah and cheap
B	I don't when we went to Spain don't think we ever to Madrid at all when we were there
A	no Madrid's different cos it's in land you don't get the fish
B	no
A	I didn't like the food in Madrid that's totally different it's all meat cos of course they don't have fish
B	yes and we decided not to go to Madrid I remember yeah
A	mm yeah I didn't like the food there so much but yeah northern Spain is where you get the fish and the seafood and that's fantastic
B	yeah
A	southern Spain's more sort of tapas which is different again
B	which part is Bilbao? I don't know
A	that's north
B	that's north is it? yeah
A	mm yeah
B	mm I don't recall
A	mm south of Spain has beautiful architecture though
B	pardon?
A	beautiful architecture
B	oh yeah yeah it's great yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah Grenada and Seville Jerez
B	mm oh who
A	mm
B	just been over there
A	that's right
A	that's a nice city
B	cos she teachers there doesn't she?
A	mm
B	yes
A	that's funny we've done quite similar things me and
B	have you?
A	although we have hardly seen each other in probably fifteen years but we both studied Japanese and we both went to Japan and lived and we both lived in Spain
B	oh
A	and we both taught English
B	that's very strange isn't it?
A	it is odd isn't it?
B	yeah very strange
A	cos I mean we've hardly met so it's not like we could've had a discussion about it
B	no
A	yeah it's very odd
B	yeah
A	so I wonder what will happen
B	well I don't know I know I know
A	yeah well it's lovely it is lovely
B	yes he doesn't want to come back to the UK to live
A	no
B	no
A	they've got lovely weather there
B	yeah
A	beautiful city got lots of interesting places around Seville actually like within about an hour
A	you could be in Granada or
B	yeah
A	Jerez yeah
B	I think
A	mm
B	when he he was in this wheelchair or at least whatever he gets around in
A	that's nice yes I suppose they're not as rushed there
B	probably not no
A	no Seville that's where they have the flamenco I think as well that's traditional think that's Seville
B	I know we went to a bullfight there and mummy wasn't keen on that
A	no
B	or grandma I mean yeah
A	no well mum remembers that
B	does she?
A	yes
B	oh
A	I think she secretly liked it
B	yeah
A	although she has to say otherwise
B	yeah I thought they'd abolished all that haven't they?
A	erm in Barcelona it's banned now
B	yeah
A	but I think it's very political
B	oh
A	so they banned it because they hate Madrid and they want to be independent
B	oh
A	and I think it didn't have much to do with the animals Madrid it's still going strong
B	yeah
A	and as soon as Barcelona banned it
B	oh
B	cos there's parts of Spain where they're not Spanish almost isn't there? but
A	yeah but not all over Spain it it's parts of Spain
B	almost yeah
A	I think some parts of Spain have never had it and other parts it's extremely traditional
B	mm
A	yeah it is brutal though because they have erm bullfighting in South America but it's completely different they don't kill the bull
B	no oh don't they?
A	no so it's sort of dancing around the bull and jumping on it and things but they never ever hurt the bull
B	oh I remember when mum and I saw it they they slaughtered it there and then like yeah
A	yeah so Spain they kill it and actually
A	bullfighting's big in Oman believe it or not
B	is it? yeah
A	but it's completely different it's one bull against another bull
B	oh
A	and they can kill each other but they don't usually that's interesting
B	oh this one we had the matador there
A	yes yeah they were in trouble weren't they the other day? cos he had a baby in his arms one of these matadors and he went
B	well they took a child did they? yeah
A	yeah a baby in his arms that was ridiculous
B	that's just part of showing off I suppose yeah
A	he was showing off yes he got in trouble over it I thought well you deserve it that's really irresponsible
A	it's one thing for a grown man to go in
B	yeah
A	I mean that's his choice isn't it but?
B	I think I think it is yeah
A	different with a bay
B	I think your grandma gave up on it and came out I think
A	yes
B	didn't like it all this
A	then they have that running of the bulls don't they in Pamplona?
B	oh no yes we've seen that we've been there
A	yeah
B	yeah all running chasing out jumping the doorways all the windows boarded up
A	Hemingway wrote about that didn't he?
B	oh did he? yeah
A	he lived there for a while and he wrote about it
B	yes I
A	I'm not surprised
B	all this
A	wouldn't want a bull through it would you?
B	no no
A	yes interesting
B	we've seen a bull I've seen we've seen that bull rush though we've seen them
A	yeah that's something and that's different to killing them I suppose that's not the aim they just run from one end of the city to the other don't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	have you seen that too?
A	no I haven't no it's very popular now people come from all over the world to go and see it
B	yeah
A	mm people get injured every year
B	oh there's always somebody hurt yeah
A	yes
B	mm
A	I suppose whale hunting it's easier to make an argument to ban it because they're endangered species
B	oh right
A	whereas bulls aren't endangered
B	where did we see those things? oh we went down to the Falklands that's right
A	oh you saw whales?
B	yeah the whales were down there when we went down there
A	mm
B	a lot of whaling done down that part
A	mm yes Japan still has an annual whale hunt but it is very traditional you can't argue about that
B	yeah
A	and it was an important part of their diet it's not any more but yeah but I suppose if they're endangered they're endangered aren't they? you can't just say well I've always killed them so I'm gonna carry on
B	I
A	oh right mm
B	it was
A	I'd like to go yes
B	I think he only went once on the school trip I think he said
A	ah right mum and dad want to go on a cruise
B	does she? what's that for?
A	they're not going this year this year they're going to Austria
B	bet your dad's interested in cruising isn't he?
A	yes
B	yes perhaps he likes the food better
A	I think he does yeah he loves the food
B	yeah
A	yes cos he was saying he wouldn't like cruising then he went and he loved it
B	did he?
A	yes
B	yeah who was it like? oh oh
A	oh yes I expect he loves it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	well I suppose it's nice for children cos they're fairly safe
B	yeah
A	can be there's quite a lot of entertainment on
B	yes there wasn't much well I suppose we went out of season with
A	mm are you going on a cruise this year?
B	just trying to think whether mum's booked anything up
A	I can't remember no I was wondering that or maybe you're doing a river cruise is that right?
B	I don't expect so
A	no oh might be oh not sure then
B	I
B	have you been to Egypt have you?
A	no you know it's I'd like to see the pyramids but I think yeah that's put me off going to Morocco actually
B	yeah yeah
A	I can imagine Egypt's very similar with the kind of hassle
B	well when you've been so when you've been in one of those
A	well I suppose so yeah
B	they all they all look a bit
A	yes just go to the British Museum and see all the things we stole
B	no
B	it's funny that er cos I think
A	I know yeah I'm sure why
B	no well no we didn't bother with it either
A	I wasn't impressed at all there's a lovely Roman ruins but then you could say the same about lots of places in Europe couldn't you? you could go to Italy and see them
B	yeah
A	you don't need to go to Morocco and see them
B	there are more of them in Italy
A	there might be less people but I don't know just found the whole thing a headache
B	no
A	you'd be better off going to to Italy or Greece or something if you wanted to see nice towns
B	yeah but have you been to Italy yet?
A	no no I haven't I'd like to go
B	no
A	but maybe out of season
B	where's that? it's
A	oh yes Vesuvius
B	I was there too yeah
A	you've been there haven't you? yeah that's interesting
B	well it's still smoking now when we were three yeah
A	mm yes I'd like to go there yes I remember grandma was very taken with that
B	she was yeah
A	yeah Pompeii that would be worth visiting
B	yeah Pompeii yeah that's an interesting place
A	mm yes I always find er Japan has quite a lot of volcanoes
A	yes a lot to see there yes lots of history and then you've got the volcanoes yeah it's interesting
B	it isn't well
A	er yeah oh actually I have been to Italy yes I've been to I've been to Milan actually but only changing planes but I had to change
B	oh yeah
A	airports so I did actually go into Milan and had a look round
B	oh it's a big city up there though yeah
A	mm it's a nice city yes
B	yeah well it's quite different to the rest of Italy though
A	but yeah I'd rather go to somewhere rural I think
B	yeah it's always nice
A	yes yeah
B	where did we go? we've been several times course I went with your mum didn't we somewhere?
A	mm
B	where did we go with?
A	you went to Rome I know you've been to Rome with her but I expect you stopped in a few places in Italy
B	yeah we did yes we
A	with
B	but we went to other places of course and we've been two or three times before
A	mm
A	yeah
B	there were chaps going round in carts can't be ice creams
A	no
B	yeah
A	very patriotic the Italians
B	oh yeah
A	more than other countries in Europe actually
B	yeah yeah that's right yeah
A	cos I taught Italian teenagers this summer in
B	oh
A	very patriotic they love their country that's nice though it's good
B	yeah I mean
A	healthy
B	well General Franco didn't do em much good though did he?
A	no well I suppose they're too young to know aren't they?
B	they are yeah no no no no
A	they're probably something their parents don't mention
B	yeah no no there's well nobody does now cos it's a long time ago I suppose
A	yes
B	general Franco
A	yeah
B	I think I think there's one part of Spain where they still
A	yeah Galicia actually
B	oh is it there?
A	when I was there some people were still staunch supporters I was really surprised and they would openly say it and I'd think oh goodness
B	yeah that's I thought it was
A	you know you're out of touch
B	no er
A	cos
A	but you see some people did well out of him
B	oh yes yes
A	that was the thing I mean never mind the fact that you butchered you know many millions elsewhere but
B	well you could always remember those who who supported him in the when in the fighting of course this what's it? and they were
A	well yes he favoured those who supported him so people in Galicia got given houses you know like huge
B	did they? yes
A	country houses which he'd appropriated of course against
B	yeah
A	from his enemies and you know locked them up and put them in prison and killed them but never mind that you know they did very well they got a nice country estate out of it
B	yeah
A	erm so they support him they're like what's the problem?
B	cos there
A	yes well there still are and you wonder how those people got them to be honest
B	oh yeah yeah yes that's right yeah
A	and then they've got this law of forgetting haven't they? where the the court aren't allowed to investigate the disappearances which just seems incredible to me they are banned from erm investigating and then the one that did got killed about a year ago
B	oh
A	he was investigating and was told he had to stop and so as far as I know he did or at least he did publicly but he probably carried on in private and then he had a mysterious accident or something
B	did they bump off? I've forgotten now did they bump off a lot of people in Spain during the war?
A	yes and then they've never been investigated
A	there's all these mass graves
B	yeah all over the place
A	and they're they're not you know marked or anything and
B	just
A	for those people who lost family members
B	yeah
A	they've never got over it because there's been no justice I mean there
B	yeah
A	I suppose at least if there was some kind of court case they might feel
B	yeah
A	someone was held accountable but these people are politicians who did it
B	course it was France he was sort of anti-communist wasn't he I mean?
A	yes but not just anti-communist he didn't like the people in what's that called in the north? where they speak a different
B	oh the Basque yeah Basque yeah I know
A	and he bombed that erm Guernica wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yes they disliked them cos
A	he didn't like the Basques
B	it's still part of Spain though isn't it? but they consider themselves as separate
A	yes but he that's right and the really didn't like that cos he was very nationalist erm and they wanted to break away so didn't get on
B	course he was a good friend of Hitler at the time
A	that's right well that's another thing
A	yes
B	well
A	yes but I don't think Spain is a very fractured country and I think that's a lot of the reason why because they've just buried their past and unlike Germany who've had you know a very public
B	yeah
A	outing of people and they're still prosecuting people from the war Spain just buried it all they just said we don't want to know we're not going to prosecute
B	I remember your your grandma and myself sitting on a wall looking out from about a mile away we were up high and they they had one of these big processions going on
A	oh right
B	and it was going I mean it was literally going on for
A	cor right
B	a hundred or two or there there was a thousand on some pilgrimage somewhere
A	oh right
B	they seem to go in for pilgrimages in Spain
A	oh yes they're big on that yes
B	yeah yeah
A	I did it from
B	you did it did you?
A	yeah I did the Camina de Santiago which is erm
B	that's the one I'm thinking of yeah
A	a pilgrimage there's like nine or ten different routes I didn't do the main one the main one is from France to
B	yeah
A	the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela which takes about two months believe it or not
A	well I I didn't do that one I did the ten-day route from Portugal I just thought it would be a nice thing to do
B	oh yeah
A	cheap holiday too because all along the way they have these hostels run by the local council they only cost five euros a night about three pounds
B	oh that's cheap
A	and you would take your own food but there was a kitchen
B	yeah
A	or I just used to eat out I used to have a loaf of bread and make sandwiches for you know for the day and have I think toast for breakfast
B	mm
A	then I'd just have a meal out which aren't very expensive in Spain it was all very simple food they did get a bit of wine half a bottle of wine very simple pork or something like that you know loin of pork grilled
B	I don't know whether there still is but Spain was very very Catholic at one time when we used to go to it
A	yeah I don't think it is
B	all the churches used to be full up completely
A	yes now it seems to be dying but I don't think
B	it's dying out is it? yeah
A	the values have been lost the
B	oh yes
A	more than the UK
B	Spain got a good football team
A	well yeah they I suppose they do don't they?
B	oh yeah
A	they love football there
B	yeah
A	no that's their religion now Real Madrid and Barcelona
B	yeah I think they stopped all the stuff er killing the bulls and stuff there haven't they?
A	no they still have it in some places
B	oh I thought they stopped it all the whole of Spain not the whole of Spain
A	no Madrid did the opposite as soon as Barcelona banned it then they
A	they took over yeah yeah
B	yes your mum couldn't stand to look at it too long
A	no
A	well must be quite gory
B	didn't look very nice with I mean blood being spilt all over the place
A	no it's difficult to ban things like that though I suppose
A	it's not like they're in any danger of dying out as a species
B	did we
A	no I wouldn't go actually I I wouldn't want to see that
B	well it looks to be a very brave chap who's fighting one of those things
A	yeah must be very brave but then it's the odds are always stacked against the bull so
B	yeah well at the end of the day that's the bull gets trouble
A	yeah
B	gets its throat cut whatever
A	but I suppose it is kind of
A	other countries in Europe to try and ban it I mean we have things here that are cruel
B	yeah
A	farming of pigs is cruel in this country all you know crammed into tiny cages but we didn't start banning that did we? so I suppose as long as we have things like that
B	oh no
A	then
B	I don't
A	well they stun cattle don't they?
B	yeah
A	yes I mean cattle's not so bad I was thinking more
A	you know the animals that are kept in cages all their life
B	oh yeah
A	and never get to go outside so things like pigs and chickens
B	oh they're kept away yeah
A	that does seem cruel I mean that's crueller to me
B	yeah
A	than a bullfight cos at least the bull had a nice life
B	yeah
A	and those bulls are probably five years old
B	yeah
A	so it's had five nice years and then okay it has an unpleasant half an hour at the end that's not very nice
B	okay well he then he doesn't remember the rest of his life
A	yes but it probably doesn't remember does it?
B	no
A	but that seems crueller to keep an animal inside in a cage all its life to me so perhaps we haven't got the right
B	no
A	to tell Spain what to do with its bulls
B	perhaps some of the zoos still have animals kept in don't they? some of them
A	yes that's not right either is it?
B	no
A	I suppose zoos
B	they used to have one at Bristol but I thought they closed that down didn't they?
A	oh I don't know I don't know about that London zoo's popular you know what has disappeared? animals in circuses
B	you what?
A	animals in circuses
B	yeah
A	cos when I was young that used to be really common didn't it? going to the circus and seeing the tigers and things
A	but that's disappeared
B	oh yes we'll all see all these big vehicles turning up with tigers in the back
A	that's right that's completely gone yeah I mean circuses are still going but nothing like
B	oh no
A	before
B	no these it was used to be a very big day the circus
A	yeah it was lovely wasn't it?
A	yes yeah that was a nice thing they used to come round smaller towns I suppose now you have to go to a big town to see a circus
B	yeah
A	and then it wouldn't be animals it would be people
B	I think we still have one in
A	oh do you? that's nice mm
A	but that was cruel wasn't it? I suppose keeping tigers in tiny cages that wasn't right and elephants and things I wonder what happened to them all
B	no mm
A	I wonder what they did with all those
A	I remember going when I was younger I
B	we took you somewhere in outside of
A	yes yes we went to some sort of not a zoo
B	yeah
A	not a safari park though something in between sort of in fields and things yes that was nice I like those
B	you'd've only about eight or nine then I suppose were you?
A	yes yeah I loved animals though didn't I?
A	I still like them
A	mm
B	your grandma used to like cats I didn't
A	oh right
B	I
A	yeah yes cats I always felt if they were a bit bigger they would eat you whereas dogs would be loyal
B	yeah
A	it wouldn't matter if the dog was bigger than you the dog would still look after you but a cat I just think it's because you're bigger than it that it doesn't attack you
B	oh
A	I don't think they've got any loyalty to people at all
B	I hadn't thought of it that way round no
A	I think we're
B	I just dislike cats yeah
A	I think a lot of people are suspicious of cats cos cats can be quite cruel can't they with killing prey as well they'll play with their pray
B	yeah
A	they won't just kill it
B	yeah yeah
A	like they love playing with mice
B	oh
A	and then they'll play with it for ages whereas a dog will just go in and kill it that's the end of it usually
B	mm mm
A	oh right
B	so you could feed it
A	yes yes
B	we used to have photographs nursing her favourite pets
A	oh right
B	sometimes chickens and sometimes cats
A	oh they used to have rabbits too didn't they?
B	oh yes rabbits they did yes rabbits
A	yeah it's a good source of meet
B	yes I think her dad used to trap them that's right he used to trap them yeah
A	yeah
B	go out in the fields
A	well it is a good source not going anywhere are they? they breed quick enough
B	no no no
A	oh yes mm
B	yeah I saw a couple the other day
A	got lots of pheasants round by me
B	yeah the pheasants yeah yeah
A	loads of pheasants yeah
B	there was a lot of pheasants up in Yorkshire I think
A	oh really? yeah
B	mm
A	yeah pretty birds
B	what
A	mm?
B	with a green green belt round his neck green
A	oh I wonder what that is not the woodpecker cos he's red round his neck isn't he? don't know
B	well
A	yeah it might be the green woodpecker they like orchards they
B	mm
A	and then they sort of crash and they just do that across the lawn very odd flight
B	no
A	don't know why
B	I remember
A	oh really?
B	yeah cos er he always said he was he was
A	yeah
B	and he was just doing nothing suddenly this big bird dived down towards him
A	oh he's been
B	he was terrified he he he raced into the barn
A	had a nest or something oh dear
B	terrified of it
A	have you got bats in the barn?
B	we've had bats over there yeah we've had bats over there
A	yeah thought so
B	I don't think we've got em now though
A	no
B	but we do get a bit of a different array of birds your grandma used to feed a lot of them outside
A	yes that's right I remember
A	and that squirrel was a problem wasn't he? he used
B	he was what?
A	the squirrel he used to destroy all the nut holders within days
B	oh the squirrel yeah yeah yeah
A	a destructive squirrel
B	in fact there was on the other day you
A	oh right
B	by the lawn there was a squirrel in there
A	yeah yes they can be quite destructive
B	we don't see many squirrels though now
A	no I wonder what they've done with them yeah I wonder if they're killing them off
B	erm
A	doesn't seem to be that many
A	oh really? yeah
B	yeah
A	dear farmers don't seem to like any animals do they?
B	no not particularly
A	kill the foxes kill the rabbits
B	oh yeah?
A	he hates British farming he's really anti it
B	oh
A	he calls it the green desert
B	oh does he?
A	he says it's all monoculture in this country and that's wrong
B	oh
A	cos er nothing can survive
B	was he doing a lecture there was he?
A	yeah yeah it was quite interesting he was
B	oh
A	talking about rewilding the UK
B	oh
A	so bringing back you know animals that have been hunted to extinction cos in
B	oh I see there was a programme on the other day photographing that
A	yeah it's near me actually it's just near
B	yeah
A	but the only other colony is down here
B	otters are they?
A	no erm beavers
B	oh they're beavers?
A	yes but they're in a town called
B	oh I see yeah
A	which I suppose should have otters really but doesn't
B	do they get otters down here though don't you into
A	you do yes
B	yeah
A	but they're quite shy I've never seen them
B	I think I've seen em I think I've seen em somewhere
A	oh that's nice I've only seen them in zoos they're quite big
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	dunno where we saw them somewhere in the river they were poking their heads up
A	that's nice I bet that's a nice sight
A	yes they like that kind of fast flowing water don't they?
B	yeah I think so I think that's I think that was where we saw them some in the river somewhere mm
A	mm can I take that for you?
B	no it's okay I'll it on there
A	it's alright I've got it I'll just put it on the sofa over there
B	that was
A	it was nice wasn't it?
B	yeah lovely
A	yeah I like a nice simple tea like that
B	yeah it was very have you had something to eat?
A	yes I had a sandwich like you
B	oh that's fine
A	and I had some fruit do you want anything else
B	oh oh that no that's fine dear
A	oh it's nice to have a nice clean tea like that I prefer having a
B	yeah it's nice
A	main meal earlier in the day and then something light for tea
B	yeah light
A	yeah
B	they
A	yes yes that's right yes we probably do it the wrong way round a lot of us in this country but it's because we're working so we you can't really eat at lunchtime
B	no a lot of people start eating about nine o'clock at night don't they?
A	yeah it's not good is it? Spain do that yeah the Spanish always eat late
B	late yeah
A	very late yes but then they're
B	bet all the cafes seem to open up about eight o'clock at night don't they yeah?
A	that's right they don't open if you try and go at six o'clock they're all shut and they'll what? food now?
B	what? yeah no no
A	can't be from round here
B	no no
A	yes
B	I quite like Spanish food though mum used to dislike it but I quite Spanish food
A	yes it can it can be very good on the coast it's much better than inland
B	all the fish yeah
A	inland it can be a bit greasy but if you
B	it's
A	it is yes it is a big country
B	it looks smallish on the map but but it it's quite big
A	yes yes I think it's deceptive on the map
A	Portugal I like food's
B	yeah we we we like Portugal yeah we taken yeah we've been to Portugal several times
A	different yeah
B	oh well no
A	all that white sliced loaf not very nice flavourless
B	oh no no I agree
A	but other food they do really well it's funny
B	I think well you liked Portugal no?
A	yes I like Portugal the Portuguese are nice nice people
B	I think me and
A	oh right
B	so we called in
A	oh lovely
B	you know to welcome you like
A	yes
B	mm
B	I think your mum's done quite a bit of travelling haven't they?
A	they've done a lot yeah it's good yeah it's good to have an interest
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she used to
A	I know she's off now isn't she?
A	she's up in
B	oh of course of course yeah
A	but I mean he could've gone if he wanted to
B	didn't want to yeah
A	but he didn't want to I don't I never quite understood that though cos they both like outdoor things
A	and they seem to end up doing it separately a lot
B	I don't suppose
A	oh no she wouldn't want to do that
B	places yeah
A	but she's off to the Orkney Isles this summer to do a ten day cycling trip on her own
B	is she? on her own? oh
A	yeah it's good isn't it?
B	that takes a bit of doing on your own
A	I think so yeah
B	yeah
A	that's quite brave
B	it must seem a bit boring to be on your own wouldn't it?
A	yeah it might be yeah I hope she's okay
B	yeah she might like it but yeah
A	yes might be a bit lonely
A	yes
A	yes that's true she's going to take a smartphone with her so that she can contact people easily which is a good idea
B	oh it's pretty sensible I suppose
A	yes yeah they found an Iphone the other day on a walk
B	did they?
A	yeah when they came to near me er we went on a walk and dad found an Iphone just in a field
B	someone just dropped it yeah
A	yes they said oh mum said oh that's nice I'll have that I said mum do you know how much those cost they're about three hundred pounds
B	oh
A	or more they cost five hundred pounds new a lot of them
B	oh
A	I said you can't just take it you've got to give it to the police and she looked quite upset
B	did she?
A	it's funny isn't it people's attitude to
B	yeah
A	to crime?
B	crime
A	cos if that was a wallet or if she found a five pound note
A	she would always hand it in
A	she would definitely hand in money and she would be very angry if someone stole a wallet you know cos she would see that as stealing but an Iphone she couldn't see anything wrong with that she goes oh they'll have insurance
B	oh
A	but they've probably got insurance for their wallet too but it's still we all know it's wrong to take someone's wallet
A	and we no probably none of us would do that but I said mum that's got to go to the police she said oh and dad was like oh well and I said no you've got to hand it in
A	it's funny dad's very honest and he said no no I will hand it in but I'll hand it in in
B	oh yes
A	thinking that it'll be too much hassle for you know this person to go and get it
B	oh
A	which it probably
B	so what happens if they don't collect it?
A	well that's what I asked dad cos I know the rule used to be with wallets if no one claimed it I don't know how many weeks
B	certain time yeah
A	then you've got to keep the money
B	oh
A	but I don't know what the time limit was but there was erm
B	oh no
A	a finders' rule but nowadays I don't know maybe the police pocket all the money
B	no
A	who knows
A	no
B	gotta hand it over
A	well I suppose if you found loose money there'd be no point going to the police would there? if it was five pounds but if you found a wallet then you should definitely hand it in
B	I did that once coming down the train from London
A	mm
B	down to
A	yeah
B	and took my coat down and my wallet fell out apparently
A	oh
B	and and so when I got off the station of course or at least got out of the train couldn't find my wallet
A	oh no
B	so I guessed it must be on there so I went into the rail office and they said we'll ring the driver
A	oh that's nice
B	which they did and they found it
A	oh that's good
B	yeah so I
A	yeah
B	so what happened? oh
A	oh that's very kind
B	they told me just to
A	yeah to drive down there
B	call in there
A	yes
B	you know
A	yeah I've lost phones before and got them back the same kind of thing it's falled out of my pocket and I've got that back the driver's gone and checked and I've had that back the next day yeah so it was good
B	well some of these people things buy these days cameras and stuff and sort I mean of course you've got five hundred pounds some of those phones yeah
A	I know that Iphone could well've been two or three hundred pounds I reckon
B	pounds yeah yeah
A	I mean it may be damaged but even so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm I must say I was very
A	yeah that's nice mm
A	mm
B	er oh another one I had oh yes I suppose when we used to live in Somerset I suppose where would I've been? I must've been dozing off on the train it
A	yeah mm
B	and I was I looked out thought
A	oh no
A	get in trouble nowadays doing that
A	oh dear
B	I
B	that was your grandma's favourite form of travel trains
A	they are nice it's relaxing think grandma got the bus once erm to Chester and she went the wrong way or something and she went past the stop and she was in a dreadful state
B	who was this?
A	grandma
B	did she?
A	yes
B	I've forgotten was I there then?
A	no she would've come up on her own after one of the births to look after the
B	oh is that what happened?
A	yes
B	oh I see
A	she probably wasn't used to travelling on her own
A	oh I would can't've been more than six
B	oh very young then yeah yeah
A	yes cos
B	oh yes oh yes
A	mm
B	you
A	no no
B	no
A	I don't think that's ever going to be okay to be honest
B	well he's tried he's tried very hard to do the other thing hasn't he
A	well I don't know
B	oh I think he tries to be
A	I think he's probably a
B	yeah
A	he's probably a very good father
B	yes er his daughter
A	yes no he's probably an excellent father
B	yeah
A	he would he would want to be but unfortunately not a very good brother
B	oh
A	maybe
B	someone said he wants to be friends I don't know
A	yeah well he's not making much effort
B	oh is he not? oh
A	no no he never said sorry never taken any responsibility but and erm
B	does he not?
A	yes just seems to want to blame other people so that's not very mature
B	no no no no
A	but anyway I suppose he's got that from somewhere yes
B	I thought he'd got better when he after he'd been to er
A	oh yeah I'm sure he's I'm sure he would be an excellent father he would
B	yeah
A	cos he likes children he would be he would care about them and look after them yeah
B	and your grandma always liked him coming to
A	yes yeah that's nice
B	he used to come on his own sometimes I think
A	yes that's nice yes
B	yeah so yeah so yeah
A	yes
B	so she used to give him full marks occasionally
A	yes
B	I used to put him on the bus
A	yes that's right cos he came and did his work experience didn't he?
B	yeah that's right yeah he's that's right that's oh that's right put him on the bus
A	mm
B	send him off
A	yeah
B	he didn't
A	that's right he went er to
B	that's right yeah
A	well he was only about fifteen probably but er
B	he'd've only been a youngster yeah that's right yeah
A	yes he spent a couple
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yes that was good good experience for him
B	yeah I think he like kept tormenting you didn't he? think so
A	yes
A	no he wasn't very nice growing up
B	no no I suppose not no no
A	well it's different when you're a child but when you're an adult that's not really acceptable
B	oh he
A	yes I mean
B	yeah
A	well they were young
B	yeah
A	however annoying they were
B	yeah
A	but when someone's an adult and they're well he's violent towards me to be honest
B	yeah when did you last see erm see him then
A	erm oh at grandma's funeral I saw him
B	oh yes
A	he was here then
B	oh yes that's a couple of years back so you've seen him
A	no he's not very nice to me to be honest
B	well not now he isn't?
A	no no he's not very nice
B	oh oh that's not very nice then
A	no
B	he should've got over that by now
A	yes yeah I suppose he's always had a problem with alcohol hasn't he? he drinks too much and that's when his bad behaviour comes out
B	does he still drink too much does he?
A	yes
B	that's army
A	and then well no he's always done it so I don't think it's the army's fault
B	no
A	probably the army helped him to be honest because you you can't turn up drunk to work can you there?
B	no no no that'll get in you trouble
A	I mean you can't turn up drunk to work anywhere but
B	yeah
A	of course the the army would be quite strict
B	oh I remember him now you say that because he
A	yes he's always had a problem
B	he came to see us once with
A	that's right and they both got drunk didn't they? behaved very badly
B	oh yes they were yeah they had all those er there were some
A	yes
B	they found where they were they drank them between them
A	yes
B	no oh I think er
A	yeah no it's not okay to do that
B	and and he he he told them all off I think
A	yes
A	and again it's different if you're a child cos it's up to the child cos it's up to the parents to to control the alcohol in the house isn't it?
B	yes
A	you can't expect a child to
B	no
A	to manage their drinking
B	yes yes
A	but as an adult that's not acceptable
B	I think now though er I think er
A	yes
B	cos he was a bit older in any case
A	that's right
B	yeah that's right
A	yeah it's all very well blaming
B	well yes just copying I suppose yes yeah yeah
A	yes yes
B	yeah
A	oh well
B	it
A	I don't think so I mean if someone's violent that's it as far as I'm concerned you can't hold knives against people's throats and threaten to kill them
B	he he hasn't done that to you has he?
A	yes he has mum knows that
B	oh does he?
A	but she thinks that's okay so
B	oh that's wrong no
A	threatened to kill me threatened to kill
B	did he?
A	yeah I mean he's he was drunk probably
B	oh yeah of course
A	but that's not acceptable
B	no
A	and once you cross that line and I don't care whether it's a man or a woman
B	no
A	that's not okay and this is his brother and sister
B	oh no when he does that you think you'd call in the police more than anything else
A	I'm sorry I didn't actually
B	yeah
A	I'm really sorry I didn't but he was my brother so I suppose you don't think of calling the police
B	I know but someone puts
A	well that's it that's what I've decided I'm not going to see him any more
B	oh no
A	because you
B	yeah
A	like well you can still kill someone when you're drunk can't you?
B	yeah
A	being sober does would probably be better
B	I think he likes going to the pubs now doesn't he?
A	yeah I mean having a drink that's fine we all have a drink don't we?
B	yeah
A	but we don't all go around holding knives against people's throat and threatening to kill them
B	well no I
A	no so to be honest I don't feel safe around him
B	don't you? not with
A	well not if someone
B	oh no no no frightened you for life
A	so that's that that's why I can't deal with him
B	no no no
A	it was a long time ago but it happened more than once and years apart I mean
A	I mean not that it's okay if you did it once but when someone has a pattern of behaviour when they get drunk
B	yeah
A	and you can't feel safe around them
B	no cos er this that's very often the case when people get drunk cos they do things they wouldn't otherwise do
A	well I'm sure he wouldn't
B	no
A	and I'm sure he'd never behave like that in front of his children either
B	no no no
A	drunk or otherwise but he probably doesn't get drunk around his children but
B	no no
A	mm I wouldn't've thought well
B	although I
A	yes that's the trouble and that you see that's when I see him at parties and things and that's when he's most likely to get drunk isn't it?
B	cos I remember that's right when he was staying here I suppose
A	yes
B	there was
A	yes
B	and and and saw them drinking these things
A	yes
B	and
A	well good that's good and he's done the same at
A	yeah yeah
B	oh well
A	but I mean there's one thing getting drunk it's quite another thing to become violent towards someone
B	well that's that's horrendous
A	I mean that's a different I mean lots of people get drunk it might be bad manners and
B	yes
A	rude but in itself
A	you know it's not the end of the world is it? I mean it's rude
A	yes
B	yeah he does yeah
A	and he's never said sorry or taken any kind of responsibility in fact the opposite he'll say oh why are you still upset about it? you think hang on a minute you know you had a knife against my throat and you said you'd kill me
B	what did he say to that then?
A	he's just like oh well you know she shouldn't bear a grudge
B	oh
A	oh for goodness' sake it's not a grudge
A	I mean this is fear
A	I mean it was just crazy
B	yeah yeah that's a fair point
A	and this wasn't when he was in the army cos they do say you know when you see things in the war people
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know that this wasn't when he
B	bit different yeah no no no
A	he was in the military so
B	yeah
A	he just had a
B	yeah
A	I mean I to be to be honest I think someone who does that must be a bit mentally ill
A	because I don't think normal people go round and do that with or without alcohol
B	well he no no no cos I mean he was normally that would frighten people in any case wouldn't it?
A	yeah so I don't
B	usually means there's something wrong with them someone holds a knife to your throat
A	I think there might be something wrong with them
B	yeah
A	I mean cos he had that do you remember when he was young he deliberately shot himself in the foot
B	oh with my one of my rifles wasn't it?
A	I mean that's not normal is it? who?
B	did that at
A	yeah I mean who does that? that's not right in the head
B	well I don't know whether he did
A	well I don't think we ever knew did we?
B	no
A	but I mean it'd be quite difficult to do it by accident
B	well he had to pull the trigger to kick off this yeah yeah
A	well exactly so I think he probably did do it deliberately and then you just think well who would do that? and there probably is something a bit wrong and he was quite young wasn't he?
B	well I remember
A	probably about ten
B	yes
A	yes I know it was only an air rifle it wasn't like a you know a cartridge
A	well exactly yes I mean it's not to mess around with
B	well I know your I think your mum was looking out of the window actually and saw him
A	yes
B	he had this gun pointing at me
A	well exactly and that makes you worried
B	I I
A	yeah I know and that worries me
B	no and it worried mum and she came out at him too
A	yes
A	but I again I just think
A	you know who does that? I know he was young but still I think we all know
B	I don't well I don't think he was intending to
A	wasn't that young was he?
B	but he on that sort of thing you may just touch the trigger lightly and it goes off yeah yeah yeah
A	well that's the thing isn't it? yeah
B	doesn't take much to touch the trigger
A	well no it's quite easy to do isn't it with a trigger? it's not yes
B	yeah I was I know some of my early training when I was in the Royal Air Force the thing we had to do was to use er various things like rifles and submachine guns just to defend your aircraft if they were attacked
A	yes
B	and they used to frighten the life out ot me
A	yes I'm not surprised yes
B	no no I didn't wanna know much about that no no
A	no
B	er
A	may've done but
B	yeah
A	I suppose you know I'll always be scared of him won't I?
B	probably yes I suppose but
A	I mean it's a line you cross with a woman
B	yeah
A	and once you've crossed it that's that
B	yes
A	there's no going back
B	yes I I I would imagine all all that's gone by now he's too old isn't he?
A	maybe or maybe he'll always be like it
B	and he's got young children who adore him hasn't he?
A	yes and I'm sure he's a great father
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and what's what's his girl's name?
A	yes I imagine she'd be good with him actually
B	yes I mean I've seen her she
A	yeah and she's a good mum that's obvious cos her children are very well behaved
B	yeah that's right and er the last time we ever when we last saw
A	yeah
A	yes that's right no I'm sure she's very good
B	yeah kept him in line so she was obviously in command of him really
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah that's good yes
B	has she gone into? was? she was going to go into nursing I don't know if she ever did or not
A	yes I don't know what happened with that she was doing some care work for a while wasn't she?
B	yeah I think she was yeah
A	yes
B	have you met her then
A	yes once yes
B	yeah
A	but I suppose she got pregnant so she couldn't she had to stop that cos you can't really cos caring you have to lift people and things don't you?
B	no
A	and you can't do that when you're pregnant
B	no no yeah
A	so she had to stop that for a while
B	but they seemed to get on quite well I thought
A	yes
B	yeah I'm certain I'm certain that the the young girls they they seem to like him enormously
A	yeah
B	yeah no no
A	cos she's
B	yeah
A	but it's probably a bit much with four quite young children
B	I suppose
A	I expect that's what it was
B	yeah
A	but then he wasn't that young when that happened I mean it's one thing if you're five or even ten or fifteen but
B	mm yeah
A	he was probably twenty-five last time that happened
B	oh was he? oh that's very
A	so that's not really good enough
B	no not at twenty-five no
A	no and of course he wasn't exactly small was he? so he's very intimidating
B	well a big fellow he is now he looks a big chap
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and again maybe if someone said sorry afterwards that will never happen again
B	how old is he now then?
A	must be thirty-one
B	oh yes
A	yes
B	cos he seems to have changed when I saw him last
A	yes
A	yes I'm I'm sure he's matured a bit I think the army probably did him good
B	yes and he and he's busy up gets up at four o'clock in the morning going on these
A	so he's hard working isn't he?
B	yeah hard working yeah he's
A	yes
B	he gets extra money for all that I gather yes yes
A	yes yes it's good well it's not a bad job driving lorries is it? there'll always there'll be work for a while to come
B	well and he well and he gets
A	yes
B	then off they go again
A	yeah that's nice
B	yeah it was nice oh well perhaps they perhaps it will heal as time goes by
A	I don't think so I don't think if someone's violent like that you really get over it to be honest
B	yeah well
A	I think I mean if that was your husband or something you'd tell someone well leave your husband wouldn't you? you wouldn't say continue in a violent marriage
B	no no
A	I mean maybe in times gone by people would put up with it
B	yeah
A	but nowadays you know people would say you need to call the police
B	yeah
A	this person is dangerous
B	what was he? what did he attempt to do?
A	he threatened to kill me and he held a knife against my throat
B	oh oh did he really?
A	not just once either
B	oh well no
A	and not when he was a child so
B	oh well that's a terrible thing to have done
A	it is and he's never said sorry and he knows he did it
B	yeah
A	and
A	oh yes you know I shouldn't've done that and that's not really good enough
B	no
A	no I'm sorry I didn't call the police on him actually but then it would've really upset mum
B	yeah
A	so I suppose and you don't think at the time
B	no cos
A	yeah well that's it that's why I didn't want to say to to someone like grandma cos it would've really upset her wouldn't it?
B	oh yes she
A	yes
B	your
A	well yes and
B	no my mum
A	yeah well my mum's the same
B	is she the same is she?
A	but that's the trouble you can't talk to her about it
B	oh no
A	doesn't matter what she knows about it
B	yeah
A	and she just sort of says oh well that's
A	who's obviously got something I mean at best he's a bit unhinged or at worst he's completely sane
A	I think he would've done it as well actually he said if you say another word I'll slit your throat and he held a huge knife against my throat
B	yeah I mean that's a that's a
A	I wish I had
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh
A	although to be honest if I had I mean social services might be asking what's he doing with children?
B	yeah probably yeah
A	I mean I could've done him a lot of harm and he's I'm sure he's an excellent father
B	oh yes
A	who would never hurt his children so I
B	no
A	could've done him a lot of damage
B	no cos when we've been over there you see
A	yes yes
B	and all the children cos he er
A	yes he likes children
B	yeah he does like children yeah
A	mm
B	and they seem to like him don't they?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah they do
B	perhaps he's changed a lot now
A	I think he'll always be good with children won't he?
B	yeah I think so yeah
A	yes yes
B	I think he's tried to be friends with you hasn't he?
A	yes but it's not good enough if he's not going to say sorry and even if he did to be honest I would always be afraid of him
B	oh
A	every time he's gonna have a drink in his hand I'm going to be thinking in the back of my mind is he going to get violent again?
B	yes cos he he
A	and the trouble is he's a big boy
B	does he drink too much now?
A	he drinks too much I mean I don't know about now but he seems to be get drunk a lot
B	oh does he?
A	and become violent
B	cos someone said he goes off with oh I think er I think er
A	yes yes
B	and they have they have a little get-together in the pubs
A	yes I mean it's okay if you're just gonna have a pint or two isn't it?
B	yeah depends how far they go with it yeah
A	but that's the trouble and then you know if you say anything to him he gets aggressive so you can't say anything
B	well no
A	yes well that's good
B	the cans cos we have the cans in the cupboard there
A	yes
B	for general use and they he found
A	yes well I expect they were quite young were they?
B	oh yeah quite young I suppose so yeah
A	yes
B	cos they're still good friends those two
A	yes they are yes yes that's right
B	they're still in touch with each other
A	yes yes
B	and though though oddly enough
A	that's a bit ironic isn't it?
B	yes I thought that's er
A	pot yes
B	that's something different he was trying to put
A	yes
B	yeah I
A	don't expect
B	mm no probably not
A	well it's different if they're a child but
B	well I suppose
A	late twenties I suppose
B	yeah I suppose yes er
A	there probably is a good few yes but I suppose
B	yeah yes I suppose
A	yes
B	I think that's right mm
A	and I suppose cos he grew up with two girls he was probably desperate for a peer wasn't he? and
B	yeah yeah probably yeah I think so yeah yeah yeah
A	yes that's right
B	yeah probably
A	yes I mean he got on with his sisters didn't he
B	oh yes
A	you're not gonna have that same close relationship that two girls might
A	yeah
A	yes I suppose
B	oh
A	yes and I get the feeling
B	no no no
A	yeah so they're probably
B	no you you'll find now er it's the er I think
A	yes yeah
B	course oh
A	yes yeah I suppose
B	I think they're like yourself a bit more academic like
A	yes that's right yes and she's quite ambitious isn't she
A	she's done very well
B	and then
A	well
B	beg your pardon?
B	no I
B	yeah yes he yes oh yes yes
A	the rest of us are useless
B	yeah no no
A	we haven't got a clue I think between us
B	no
A	we could barely change a light bulb
B	no no
B	mm yeah
A	but in more of the mechanical
B	well well yes
A	sort of engineering type mind
B	yeah no he's not an academic
A	no he's not academic and
B	cos he always
A	yes yes that's probably true
B	yeah
A	well I don't no don't think that's quite true
B	no
A	yes no I don't think mum's particularly academic my mum
B	wasn't she? oh
A	I mean she's quite bright
B	yes
A	but she's not into that kind of study and books and
B	no probably not no no
A	she likes reading but not academically
B	does she like does she like music I suppose yeah?
A	she doesn't like politics at all she doesn't
B	no
A	follow the news
B	does she not? no?
A	no
B	oh
A	but she she's got a lot of interests that sort of way inclined I suppose yeah but yes
B	oh of course she did her master's
A	and
B	yeah yeah of course
A	and I like learning but I'm not really into academia I don't like writing essays
B	no no
A	I don't enjoy that
B	no it's
A	yes I think he was always a bit insecure about that and that's probably what caused a lot of the problems and dad's very academic isn't he?
A	mm
B	dad is yeah
A	yeah
B	well I remember yes what was
A	yeah he used to steal cars and go joyriding and burn them out
B	yeah I had a feeling yeah that's what I thought
A	police caught him once
B	yeah that's what I remember
A	yes
A	that's right no they came the next day actually the police
B	oh was it the next day was it?
A	yes and they said oh your son's in the police station to mum she said oh no he's not he's asleep in bed upstairs
B	yeah that's right
A	and they said no he's down at the station that went on for a couple of minutes and they said alright well why don't you show us madam? and of course he wasn't there
A	that was the only way she would believe them
B	believe them yeah yeah mm
A	so and they said would you like to come with us?
B	yeah
A	and she went down and there he was he was quite young then he was probably only about fourteen
B	yeah yeah
A	yes bit wild
B	oddly enough your grandma was
A	yes that's right
B	yeah yeah
A	yes yes that's right
B	cos I suppose he stayed with us and he behaved himself when he was with us
A	yes well yes I'm sure he did yes
B	no he didn't do anything outward
A	no
B	he er was always erm
A	no that's right
B	I suppose actually er grandma was able to control
A	yes
B	part of the answer
A	yes
B	when he was with us anyhow
A	yes that's good
B	and he really did behave himself when he was with us
A	oh yes I'm sure he would
B	yeah
A	yes I'm sure he liked being here
B	yeah
A	so he wouldn't want to have jeopardised that
B	probably no
A	no
B	it's it's you
A	yes I don't know perhaps he was jealous or something but I mean that's no excuse
B	no no no no
A	especially when you're not a child I mean
B	when did you last see
A	at grandma's funeral
B	oh you saw him there that's right
A	yes yeah
B	cos I remember
A	oh right yeah
B	were you sitting next to him were you?
A	yes
B	yeah yeah yeah of course I'd forgotten he'd been yes of course he was there yes
A	mm
B	and of course er
A	I know yeah
B	spoilt him really
A	yes
B	yeah
A	but that's a grandma's prerogative too isn't it?
B	I suppose I suppose
A	yes that's
A	that's completely understandable
B	she was
A	yes
B	and so she supported him for that I suppose
A	yes
B	evened it up a bit
A	yes that's right
B	yeah yes okay
A	no that's natural
B	well yes and and I suppose she yeah and I suppose she found
A	no he wasn't very nice growing up
B	no no growing up no I can see yeah
A	no I expect
B	well he was they had problems with
A	they they yes
B	yeah yeah
A	I think he's still difficult with them
B	yeah
A	but I mean you wouldn't know normally with
B	no I
A	yeah but then that's the problem
A	exactly but then you don't know what's going on at home
B	no no but er I think he I mean
A	you only have to say
B	yeah he he
A	yeah
B	and of course he was always spoilt by
A	yes well I think that's what happened with
B	was he? yes yeah yeah
A	er dad didn't spoil him
B	no no
A	not at all but I suppose dad was often angry with
B	yeah
A	and then yes he sort of manipulated the situation
B	yes when I saw
A	much better now yes
B	yeah I mean that's in you know quite recent times I think
A	yes that's right that's quite recent isn't it? just a few years
B	yeah that's right I was surprised to see them getting on so well together
A	yes that's good
B	yes yeah
A	yeah
B	so obviously
A	yes I think he's made an effort
B	yeah
A	yes that's good
B	so he
A	yes but to be honest I mean you can't
B	no not easy
A	you can't turn back the clock
B	no no and people remember
A	yes you do remember yes
B	but I suppose oh I I think
A	mm yes probably didn't tell you he threatened the knife thing though did he?
A	he yes well that's it he's not told you the worst things he might've told you he was annoying
B	yeah
A	which he was but there's one thing being annoying
B	yeah
A	it's another actually threatening people
B	well of course the trouble with that thing of course people could've done something dangerous in any case holding knives
A	yes and er in that sense I'm sorry I didn't call the police because actually they probably needed to know
B	no no that's right
A	and if he's done it once to a woman
B	yeah if he does
A	what's to stop him doing it to another woman?
A	or or a man for that matter I mean it's not any more acceptable but
B	yeah no
A	I mean at least a man I suppose you've got a chance of fighting back
B	yeah
A	yes she seems very good well that's good
B	yeah
A	I mean that relationship seems to work well so that's good
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er he does what she tells him
A	yes not that's excellent I could see she's a good person for him yeah
B	yeah I mean she he does all the running around
A	yeah
B	he'll fetch the nappies and do the carry the babies all sorts of things yeah
A	yes no that's excellent that's really good
B	so
A	no
B	no that's right
A	no
B	the twins they're called aren't they? er
A	yes
B	yeah oh well perhaps time will heal itself
A	mm
A	I don't think so I don't think you get over that
B	it's very difficult to get back over time I know
A	you don't you won't trust someone like that again unfortunately once they've done it once that's it
B	yeah
A	he's done it twice
B	yeah
A	so then there's no chance of
B	no
A	I mean you you don't forget that what do you do the third time?
B	you don't no no no no dangerous yes
A	and the trouble is it'll it's more likely to get worse than better
B	it yes except he's got someone tough
A	mm well I'm not saying he'd do it to her
B	no well I mean
A	I mean why would he? that's the mother of his children that would be very unlikely
B	well I think
A	oh yes yeah she is I think she's quite a tough woman
B	yeah she is she doesn't she she just doesn't
A	yes and she's done no she's not had an easy life bringing up those two children alone
B	no
A	that's not easy
B	no she's she's very much in demand
A	yes yes no I think she's quite a tough woman
B	she's good for him
A	and she's obviously a good mother
B	yeah
A	she
B	yeah
A	cares about her children a lot
B	yes yes she does and er and they got
A	yeah that little girl's lovely isn't she?
B	what's she?
B	yeah she's
A	yeah
B	have you met her then?
A	yes I met them once yes
B	yeah she's a dear little thing
A	yes yeah it's sweet
B	she was knocking on my bedroom door about half past six
A	oh right oh that's nice
A	yes
B	something special on so she come I wondered what she was doing knocking at the door and she was all dressed up in her school clothes
A	yes
A	oh right oh that's nice
B	took about an hour getting there
A	yes
B	oh well well no doubt time will gradually heal
A	maybe I don't think so
A	but erm
A	yes
B	I know one's got memories which which take a bit of eradicating I suppose yeah
A	yes well I don't think you really forget that sort of thing
B	no no
A	he did yes he behaved very badly
B	yeah
A	yes
B	and how
A	it's probably five years I think
B	oh quite a big gap
A	about five
A	mm
B	it's a wonder you were not
A	yeah well I suppose he's a big boy isn't he? he's so if he wants to be physically violent then he'll have the upper hand
B	well he's a big heavy lad yes did he try
A	yes
B	oh has he? oh oh well
A	so he's always gonna have the upper hand there
B	oh yes can't
A	can't really fight back what am I gonna do? pick up a knife and stab him in the heart?
A	yes but that's the trouble isn't it? so you've got nowhere to go with that
B	yeah no no no no
A	apart from call the police
B	yeah
A	and you know if he did it again I would call the police
B	yeah I suppose
A	and mum will have to be upset but I mean unfortunately it would be at something like a wedding it would be awful if the police came but that's the sort of thing you're looking at
B	oh yes I suppose yeah
A	I mean imagine that in the middle of
B	oh so
B	so you won't be going to
A	I will go but I might not stay the night
B	oh you're gonna be?
A	I think I'll just go for the wedding itself
B	then move away yes
A	yes and I'll ask I think I'll speak to
B	but they needn't
A	I think I'll ask her actually and tell her why
B	yeah
A	erm you know cos she is quite an understanding person and asked you know to for the seating plan to be looked at
B	yes well
A	cos I mean there's hundreds of people there it shouldn't
B	yes
A	be that difficult to be sat away from him
B	no there'd be about
A	yes I mean I I'm sure they can fix it so I don't have to yes
A	yes yes I think that's probably best
B	perhaps we'll all do the same I come and go
A	I'm sure you're fine grandpa
A	yes
B	no no no
A	I mean this unfortunately I have erm you know my ex-boyfriend
B	oh I remember
A	his father was very violent towards his mother and used to beat her up
B	oh was he? oh
A	all the time really badly not bad enough to put her in hospital
A	but the thing is you would never know
B	yeah
A	erm
A	I mean if they were like that to everyone they'd be in prison
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but I mean he was a lovely apparently gentle man he didn't drink and he was very friendly with woman you know you'd feel completely safe
B	yeah
A	and when he told me I honestly couldn't believe it
B	oh that's
A	all through my childhood and when my sister grew up it happened to her too father used to beat his sister
B	oh no
A	actually beat her up
B	oh golly
A	but you wouldn't know
B	no
A	and of course the
B	yeah
A	she's traumatised the poor woman
B	yeah
A	I mean she's never been able to work
B	no
A	she's signed off work permanently I mean she's not brain damaged or anything she's she's all there
B	no no no
A	but you know she's
B	yeah
A	a broken woman
B	did you get rid of
A	we
B	equally?
A	yes
B	oh yes yeah
A	yes but I mean that's the point isn't it? they're not like it to everybody
B	no no
A	if they were like it to everybody they'd obviously be in prison I mean er
B	yeah
A	you couldn't get away with it could you?
B	not really no no no no
A	and they must be nice superficially cos otherwise everyone would know about it
B	yeah
A	so
B	did he have nice parents
A	yes well apart from the dad with the sort of
A	Jekyll and Hyde personality but
A	I mean
A	I mean to me he was lovely
B	yeah oh
A	very friendly very polite
B	well that
A	yes well exactly
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah and his
B	yeah
A	she probably didn't fight back
B	yes
A	she was never going to go to the police
B	no
A	cos she loved her husband and she was never going to leave him but then that's what allowed it to continue and sadly
B	yeah
B	no no
A	which is awful and not when she was a child but when she reached adulthood
B	oh oh
A	yes and you know really you'd expect the daughter to say well I'm having nothing to do with you dad but you know doesn't
B	doesn't no no no no
A	no she's on antidepressants now the poor girl
B	yeah cos you were with
A	yeah a few years yeah
B	two years was it?
A	yeah yes quite a while
B	oh oh yes oh well
A	yes
B	well good job you stopped in time then
A	yes well I think we both had different plans in the UK we both wanted to come back to the UK he's
B	yeah
A	back in the UK but he's in London and I don't really want to be in
B	you're
A	yes
B	yes that's nice to be here
A	yeah so I suppose we had different plans there
B	yeah okay
A	that's okay yes
B	you you don't do you have communication at all now?
A	no
B	no no
A	I think sometimes it's best just to let things
A	yeah sometimes you can
B	yeah
A	erm but this time I didn't really feel like that
B	no no no
A	it was better to have a clean break
B	well it's
A	yeah I think it's sometimes it's healthier to have a
B	yes
A	a proper break yes
B	well it enables you to get on with life again doesn't it?
A	well exactly and he was a nice enough person
A	you know? he was gentle and yeah
B	yeah
A	he was kind very generous person
B	yeah
A	yes
B	so what brought it to a halt then? just
A	well he wanted to live in
B	oh I see yes mm
A	near his parents and I want to live down here
B	well yeah
A	so someone has to compromise really
A	and if no one's going to compromise that's not going to work is it?
B	well it should be well well he no he should compromise as a man shouldn't he?
B	you always give way to your wives normally on most things yes
A	yes I suppose his work was in
B	oh well I suppose yeah
A	that's that it's difficult for them then
B	yeah
A	it's not I mean it was you know something like teaching you could work anywhere
B	he he was he a qualified lawyer?
A	yes
B	oh yes yeah
A	and he worked in corporate law so you'd have to be where the headquarters are really which is
B	oh
A	very boring
B	yeah
A	yeah well he hated his job but the money was very good so that's why he did it
B	well in
A	yes and in the Middle East
B	yeah
A	incredibly boring it's all contracts isn't it?
A	yes
B	but some of them really I mean they were they were hopeless as solicitors
A	really?
B	some
A	yes
B	but one or two were just hopeless
A	dear
B	I I think one firm in
A	mm
B	so he was way up on the scale of it but some of his other partners
A	dear
B	yeah
A	it's amazing they get away with it isn't it?
B	well I actually one case I mean he only got the job as er as a partner there by
A	mm
B	but he was hopeless
A	yes
B	don't know what's happened to him now but he was just hopeless er er as a solicitor oh he had to retire I think
A	yes
B	cos everyone got fed up with him yeah
A	dear well I suppose that's good he took retirement but I mean he made a whole life out of it though didn't he?
B	I think he I think I think he went into market gardening
A	oh right
B	something like that yeah I think so
A	yes
B	but he he couldn't you know the law wasn't for him I suppose that was the key
A	yes
B	he'd passed the exams but he
A	oh well he must've been quite bright then cos they're not easy exams are they?
B	yeah he passed the exams but er he still wasn't good enough dealing with people like
A	oh yes
A	well that's a funny thing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	for a lot of professions you need to be good at dealing with people
B	you've gotta be
A	but all our exams are about intellect and nothing to do with people
B	yes that's right mm
A	cos we've never come up with a good system for measuring
B	no
A	your capability with people and a and a lot of jobs you need to be able to communicate don't you?
B	no you you've gotta be er you you've gotta be you've gotta be
A	yes that's right yes it's interesting and
B	was he? oh
A	because he can't get on with his boss
B	well that's ridiculous yeah yes
A	and he's quit I think three jobs in row he's incredibly good lawyer
B	yeah
A	very intellectual very smart but he can't stand people who are stupider than him and unfortunately he's that bright that's most people
B	oh
A	so that's no good he's gonna always be quitting jobs isn't he?
A	well that's it you can't can you?
B	yeah no no
A	even if you think they're stupid
B	no you're
A	they're still more powerful than you and they hired you
A	so they may
B	yeah yeah
A	but I mean he was just I I suppose it is very difficult if you're that intelligent cos you would feel like you're dealing with imbeciles a lot of the time
B	well
A	yes
B	I used to deal with the firm with erm
A	mm
B	they only got the job because er they were asked to do it by a friend of er one of the solicitors and they took him on
A	yes
B	and er when a new firm took them over the first thing to do was to sack him
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	oh well good for them
B	it was
A	yes
B	and so they had to be taken over by someone else which they did
A	yes
B	and they said they wouldn't take it over with him
A	oh right well they knew then? yes
B	yes he never went back to the solicitor he went market gardening or something yeah
A	no he's probably a lot happier I mean you can't be
A	you wouldn't be very happy in your job if you were knew you were rubbish would you?
B	well that's right no
A	so he was probably miserable to be honest
A	and then I suppose the more miserable he got
B	yeah
A	the less effort he put in
B	oh I know yes I remember that actually now there was another firm taking them over
A	mm
B	and I was asked to go to the meeting with them and er I tried to put in a good word for him you know with the
A	yes
B	er
A	no
B	they said no there's nobody
A	yes well they knew he would be a liability wouldn't he? I suppose
B	so the other
A	yes well I can understand that cos
B	then he retired and I think he went market gardening after that something completely different
A	yes well if someone's going to damage your business then you
B	well
A	can understand why they wouldn't want to take him on
B	no no
A	cos he might do a lot of harm lose them a lot of business
B	well that's right well you er you've only gotta make one big mistake somewhere and then
A	that's right
B	then the whole firm suffers yes
A	yeah so I I think they probably did the right thing
B	yeah
A	and to be honest he needed to do something else didn't he? with his life
B	yes well my old my my partners
A	mm
B	and what have they got? they've got twenty-five staff now I think so
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	he was made president
A	oh right oh that's good
B	so yeah that that's got him a good name I suppose yeah
A	yes yes
B	I they when they met him I met him with your mum actually one not very long back we met yeah we met up with them that's right and I called in at the office and he was down at
A	oh right
B	erm so this firm rang down to say he was there and he rang back to say hold them there until I get back
B	I'd like to see yes well your mum was with me then
A	oh right
B	she liked him too
A	mm
B	yeah
A	oh dear oh quite common I imagine
B	yeah I think yes I think his wife lived across the road
A	did he? that's a strange arrangement
B	I think so
A	dear
B	I I have a feeling she oh yes cos she had two daughters and they spent one week with with him on his
A	oh right
B	he had the house the other side of the road
A	that's very odd
B	well they they stayed with him
A	can understand wanting to be close by but not that close
B	and you no no
A	I mean you'd see her coming and going wouldn't you? and that'd be a bit strange
B	yeah that's right yeah yeah that's I don't think they had much contact between them but but the
A	yes
A	yes I expect so
A	I expect so yes
B	yeah yeah what's the name? I've forgotten his name now
A	oh right oh that's nice yeah
B	well it's been it's been going now since about nineteen twenty-five
A	that's yeah that's good
A	not bad is it?
B	no no no that's when he
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	oh I was asked to by one of the one of our customers
A	mm
B	they came and said why you
A	yes
B	so
A	no that's good
B	no there we are
A	yes
B	so that's I can get back there now
A	are you still in touch with people at the firm?
B	well until quite yes that's right I took your mum over one day
A	oh that's nice
B	yeah they've got very modern offices now
A	yes
B	but they used to have them in sort of
A	yeah
B	just outside and I said they've got about twenty-five staff there now so they're
A	cor they're doing well aren't they?
B	they're they're they're
A	yeah that's really good mm
B	and are oh is he London based
A	oh yeah doing well that's excellent
B	so they yeah they he did rather well that's right
A	yes do you still keep in touch with your clients? your old clients or not really now?
B	yeah they still
A	mm?
B	he told me some of the
A	oh that's nice
B	yeah they're still there so I mean they the old ones I know would've died off but the children are still running the firms
A	yeah oh right oh that's lovely isn't it?
B	yeah yeah so they've still got some of
A	do you have that one in was it
B	oh yes
A	no
B	oh yes oh yes er
A	something beginning with C
B	I
A	oh was it?
B	when we
A	yeah
B	and I used to know the father
A	oh right yes
B	and then she was the one with the money and
A	oh
B	so she provided a quarter of a million for to start the
A	goodness lot of money
B	start the business going yeah it was well they
A	they did well they got their return
B	oh they did really well oh they got their return
A	yeah I suppose mushrooms it's quite a clever thing to go in isn't it?
B	yes I used to have to
A	not going out of fashion
B	no you
A	don't need light don't need sunshine
B	yeah
A	just need some sheds
B	well that's right with the mushrooms
A	don't need much once they're up they're up it's not like you know
B	no
A	cows or something where price will fluctuate wildly
A	oh really? oh yes
B	yeah he was he thought he couldn't cope with them up there and he thought if I was up there I could
A	yes I suppose he was worried they'd trick him or something into
B	yeah well he thought they'd be too strong for him
A	yes
B	and so er he took yeah
A	didn't want to sign something he didn't understand
B	but they actually they they agreed what we asked eventually yeah so
A	oh that's good well it's probably good you were there cos they
B	cos it was
A	yes
B	he and he was selling them by the thousands
A	yes yes I can see that
A	yes
B	it's cos he had loads of
A	yeah clever man
B	yeah
A	he
B	well he started from zero but he ended up with an enormous
A	amazing isn't it?
B	and they were taken over eventually by another big firm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I expect he did well
B	oh yes I oh yeah that's right he had cancer I think and he died that's right
A	oh
B	his wife died earlier
A	yes
B	and I was surprised because she was a good horse rider
A	yes
B	and then
A	I suppose it's one of those things isn't it?
B	yeah well she died earlier I think she crashed a few horses oh she used to ride in that big
A	mm oh right
B	she did one of the one of those things
A	cor oh good for her
A	yes
B	well they were quite big they well they had big rows and rows of big you know sort of for building with all these
A	yeah oh right
B	and they they cos it was Sainsbury's used to come down and oh we used to go up to London to see Sainsbury's I
A	yeah that's nice
B	just to keep
A	nice day out
B	he er well
A	yes I suppose it's intimidating isn't it? that sort of thing if it's just one of you
B	yes yes
A	and there's a room full of suits
B	yes
A	who are trying to squeeze you know get the best price for themselves it could be intimidating there's probably a lawyer in the room and all sorts so
B	yeah well he er he yeah but yeah
A	it's nice to have someone on your side who understands the maths
B	well we used to know exactly it can't be below this price and it's gotta be some little bit above it
A	yes yes
B	and usually at the end we got something which was reasonable in those days
A	good that's good
A	mm
A	oh that's quite interesting
B	all the big erm suppliers
A	mm
B	like Marks and Spencer's and the lot I think we used to
A	yeah yeah clever man
A	oh right
B	and so he came over he thought he could
A	oh really?
B	cos his wife had died earlier so it was only him in charge of everything
A	mm
B	yeah what did happen?
A	oh wow
A	gor
A	yes
B	we kept on the manager
A	so that
B	so we just had to make sure it wasn't losing money and I think that was
A	that's good isn't it?
B	cos we want I think
A	no
B	they worked hard and all the rest of it could we keep it going?
A	yes oh that's good
B	so so we did keep it going for some time then eventually we we decided to we
A	oh that's good
B	so so everyone was was happy at the end of the day
A	yes yes that's good mm
B	it's funny the chap we used to do it with met up with
A	oh right?
B	yes he remembered me going up there yeah
A	oh
B	he was in the local firm of solicitors in
A	mm
B	er yeah that's right and
A	oh that's nice
B	yeah yeah yeah kept it going then we sold we did sell it off quite well to some some big company somewhere yeah
A	mm
B	you like mushrooms?
A	I love mushrooms yes
B	oh well should've brought I used to bring mum er I always used to
A	yeah I bet you used to get loads off them
B	well I used to bring I used to bring baskets full er for mum didn't know what to do with them
A	no
B	there were so many
A	yes that's true you can only make soup I suppose can't you?
B	but I always they they always gave me a couple of put them in the back of the the my car always
A	oh that's nice
B	erm and they used to come over and then he used to send the one of the wholesaler who put the mushrooms in in the bag or
A	mm yeah
B	put them in the back of the car at the back ready to drive home with all these mushrooms
A	wow
B	mum didn't know what to do with them
A	no
B	no no
A	no
B	you like your mushrooms?
A	yeah I do yeah what I've never understood in this country though is we only ever have one sort of mushroom when you travel to other countries it's like apples there's like six or seven different varieties in the supermarket
B	oh yeah
A	I've never understood that here we only have the closed ones the closed button ones and then the open ones
B	yeah
A	but that's actually the same
B	yeah
A	we don't have different sorts
B	no she sends me the button ones or the other
A	yeah
B	cos some of those other ones get to enormous sizes
A	yes that's right
B	then they're not wanted apparently
A	no they've gone a bit woody yeah
B	yeah that's what they say
A	yes so the the closed ones are more popular
A	but what I don't understand was why we only have one species in this country cos if you go to Japan you go down to the supermarket there'll be like five or six in every supermarket and completely different sorts there'll be these little spindly ones there'll be ones that look like brains which you can slice and fry like bacon delicious
A	I mean you you can find them probably in specialist stores here
B	yeah
A	but generally speaking we only have one sort maybe nowadays you might find oyster mushrooms at a push
B	mm
A	that's quite unusual
A	oh right yes those are you see those more and more now
B	yeah I remember we used to grow those
A	yeah
B	that must've been thirty years ago now yeah
A	yeah oh yeah it's funny though cos the UK actually if you go into the woods you know there's millions of mushrooms aren't there?
B	they grow
A	it's not a country where mushrooms are
B	yeah no yeah
A	you know an unknown quantity
B	yeah
A	but maybe the British have always been a bit suspicious of mushrooms and other countries have just had them in their diet much more
B	well yes I suppose yes it used to be what did we use to have now? there used to be some one or two varieties was very specialised I know used to
A	oh right yes
B	forgotten which ones they used to call them now we had the great big mushrooms
A	yes yes the flavour's better usually
B	oh the small ones yeah
A	yes yes they're sort of nice
B	and I used to bring your
A	no
B	no no
A	I like mushroom soup that's nice
B	oh well
A	yeah oh yes
A	yes
B	yeah yes it well actually for a long time and then of course when er when they all died and problem cos we suddenly found that the
A	mm
B	and of course after a bit of
A	oh
B	yeah so er so the company was going down
B	so then we put it into liquidation and closed it
A	oh right yeah
B	yes yeah well it it was
A	mm
A	it's bad isn't it though?
B	yeah
A	that someone you you know who works for you could do that and undermine the whole firm
B	yeah yeah that's right the man in charge we just we sacked him but er in fact
A	it's quite common though isn't it? I I mean I've seen that places I've worked where it's the manager
B	yeah
A	undermining the business and you know they have to close it and they never ever get to prosecute cos it's difficult to prove isn't it?
B	yeah no well
A	how do you prove it? how can you prove it wasn't someone else in the till?
B	yeah well I
A	no
A	that's dreadful though
B	yeah but so but what happened was what did happen er?
A	and everyone lost their job probably which is sad isn't it? that's what's
B	yeah
A	you know terrible about that
B	oh oh we kept it going but then we sold it off to a another firm
A	mm
B	but they wanted er less people on on the farm so they had to get rid of quite a lot of people
A	yeah oh it's dreadful I bet it was the manager cos they're the people with access aren't they?
B	well yes it was the manager
A	either that or the people who do the books
B	yeah oh oh well there was two on there was that's right no eventually
A	you've gotta watch the bookkeepers
B	oh yeah so one was the er sort of a secretary
A	oh yes I was gonna say
B	who gets the books
A	exactly often is
B	and er er and and the other one who was the manager yeah
A	and the manager? yeah cos I worked for that pub
B	oh yes
A	and we used to take a thousand pounds each on the tills just on the bar
B	oh yeah
A	in a night and there about ten bar staff so that's ten thousand pounds a night
B	oh golly yes
A	that's not to mention the restaurant restaurant food didn't go through our tills it went through somewhere else and they're charging well you know fifteen pounds a plate and it was full and it never made any money
B	oh there's something going wrong
A	that's not possible is it?
B	not possible no
A	so they sacked lots and lots of people cos they the manager claimed it was the staff stealing money and you know in the end head office found it was him
B	was him? oh
A	but they couldn't prove it but by then they'd probably sacked twenty people
B	yeah
A	for you know various infringement I'm not saying they didn't steal anything but I mean they were stealing a glass of wine
B	oh
A	they weren't putting their hand in the till
B	no
A	I mean it's still wrong but a glass of wine is not ten thousand pounds
A	a night and we're talking ten thousand pounds a night and yeah they said to him either you go and we won't push press for charges or you stay and we'll prosecute but they knew it'd be very difficult to prove it because he knew where all the secret cameras were
B	oh
A	so they probably didn't have any video evidence of it
B	no
A	but I remember once going upstairs with him at the end of the shift and if the till was down he used to take it out our wages and he went oh that's for me and put twenty pounds in his pocket and I thought well that's a dishonest man isn't it?
A	because when the tills are down he's taking it out our wages even though he doesn't know who it is but when the tills are up
B	yeah
A	he's saying well that's for me
B	yeah
A	and I thought well he's up to no good
B	he well no I remember I think I
A	mm
B	and I suddenly found out they'd been fiddling yeah
A	yes
B	the secretaries
A	it's often the bookkeepers
B	and so I know when
A	mm
B	and immediately he he
A	got defensive probably
B	yeah no yeah but he suddenly admitted the whole lot
A	oh really? isn't that interesting?
B	yeah he said well the secretary knew all about it he said we were both wrong
A	wow
B	yeah
A	cor
B	cos I thought well this is probably going to be a legal matter and with it being prosecutions and that sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	but when they put the liquidator they didn't want any of that
A	no well that's it you see they know don't they?
B	yeah they just wanted to send it off the best they could
A	yes
B	to help the creditors like
A	that's right
A	they get away with it these people
B	yeah but
A	it's annoying
B	well they got most of the money those people who were doing that
A	yeah
B	and but the creditors only got about twenty-three P in the pound or something
A	yeah
B	it's sad when that happens yeah
A	do you remember in
B	was it?
A	so mum used to friends with the doctor at the local practice and they they were always busy there and they were always losing money lots of money I mean tens and tens of thousand
B	yeah
A	and this is a a government
B	doctor's yes
A	you know doctors this is funded by the state but they the books never added up and they couldn't understand it and in the end they found it was this sweet little secretary used to come for piano lessons with mum her daughters used to and I used to teach their daughters flute at one point and that's what I remember I was asked to go to their house to be a nanny for the summer holidays and so I went over there and it was very luxurious I mean the sort of you know like OK magazine? where everything was just so
B	yeah luxurious yeah
A	and it was incredibly rich and her husband sold used cars and I suppose everyone in their back of the mind thought well used cars that's always been a traditional way to fiddle the the books
B	yes
A	everybody knows they swindle people
B	yeah yeah
A	so everyone I suppose thought that's where they'd made their money but we're talking millions
B	oh golly
A	and it wasn't it was her
A	and he must've known I mean the husband must've known
B	did someone go to jail for that?
A	she went to jail for that and she had two children
B	oh that's tough
A	and they put her in jail anyway but they never got all the money
B	yeah
A	once she was in prison they found out actually they'd underestimated how much she'd taken they found even more accounting things
B	really? yeah
A	but they said oh we won't bother pressing charges
B	oh
A	cos she was already in prison
B	I know when er er we found all these things happen I was wanted to go for prosecution of these people
A	mm
B	but the liquidators said they didn't want it
A	no I I that's what happened at this pub I worked in
B	no no
A	they didn't want to to push it and I suppose it damages your business as well doesn't it once that sort of thing's in the press?
B	yeah
A	it's very embarrassing for the company and might
B	yeah
A	do untold damage so they just hush it up
B	well I suppose well they as liquidators I suppose yeah they they
A	they're not interested
B	no they must be no
A	no it's not about justice for
B	no no no
A	what's happened it's about justice for the creditors isn't it?
B	that that sort of come back to
A	that's all they care about yes yes
B	I know and they asked me nothing to do with me but I remembered the solicitors asking me if I would speak to the creditors before just before I left
A	yes
B	just just say a few words say you were upset what has happened sort of thing
A	yes
B	but I don't think they were very impressed when I
A	no
B	yeah but er it was nothing to do with us but perhaps they thought it was something to do with us I don't know
A	yes
B	but I know they used to cook the books of course but it was they did er had this chap er
A	oh right
B	and I never gave it a thought until this happened I thought
A	yeah
B	he knew what he was doing this guy did cos he'd mentioned this it had happened before like some of it
A	oh dear
B	but it but they didn't want to send him to jail so they they thought they'd hang on till it was all sold up and dealt with properly
A	yes probably got away with it didn't he?
B	the the manager remained
A	that's awful isn't it?
B	he er he er he
A	how ridiculous letting him stay
B	yeah
A	should've sacked him
B	yeah yeah yeah they should've sacked him really
A	and then said if you wanna make a fuss that's fine we'll
B	but he so he
A	oh I see okay not with the books
B	no no he was the
A	mm yes well
B	yeah though there was a deputy I think we
A	yes it's probably
B	but they just let him soldier on anyway it was out of our hands at that time liquidators come in and and that was it
A	mm yes oh that's a shame
B	I know I went to the bank and told them and they oh what what we were going to do and they were quite happy
A	yeah oh well that's good
B	cos they got their all their money back
A	that's all they care about
A	they couldn't care less about the law I'm sure
B	no no no they got their money back yeah that's right
A	yes oh I think they the the banks have been a little bit too lenient haven't they?
B	yeah they yeah that's right that's yeah they usually cover their own steps banks do yeah
A	yes that's right well they've also turned a blind eye in this country to a lot of money laundering
A	cos it was money coming through the bank wasn't it? they don't care where it's care from
A	I think they care now cos they've done all sorts of damage to themself like HSBC's in done
B	oh HSBC yeah yeah to them yeah
A	irreparable damage to their reputation now but they're
B	oh yeah well I suppose now it's all forgotten about isn't it? whereas yeah definitely
A	well it will be won't it? yeah I mean they'll have to pay a fine but the fine they will pay will be nothing like the profits they've made over the past thirty years
B	that's it
A	from illegal money laundering
B	yeah no there's a lot of that going on
A	yes
B	it's it's stopped now though hasn't it?
A	well it's stopped in this country but they've just caught up in Switzerland haven't they with HSBC?
B	have they?
A	that was only about six months ago
B	oh
A	it turned out
B	oh
A	and then it got picked up by other EU governments and they are pressing charges
B	oh
A	and the Americans have been very good haven't they about insider trading and things?
B	oh some of them
A	that they prosecuted some big banks
B	I think I remember seeing the press recently yeah that's right
A	but I suppose the trouble is you need a big country like the USA to take on something like HSBC
A	cos they've
B	yeah
A	got their team of lawyers
B	yeah yes yes
A	and you've got your team of lawyers and it's just that's gonna drag on for years and cost billions in taxpayers' money and you never really get that money back I suppose do you?
B	they only
A	well it's true isn't it?
B	yeah that's right
B	yeah
A	the fine will be nothing like what they've spent on legal fees
B	no no
A	so it's more to set the precedent and I suppose most governments
B	cos we did that on this company I was talking about there was a question should we prosecute? it was
A	and I suppose they're thinking legal fees
B	oh and they decided mm well the creditors er the erm creditor I think decided not to prosecute
A	yeah
B	which
A	well it's true
B	with all the people who'd be paying them
A	it's unfortunate
B	yeah
A	but I mean it's the system's wrong that that happens but you might lose money
B	yeah
A	by winning
B	yeah probably yeah yeah yeah
A	yes you lose money either way whether you win or whether you lost
B	yeah perhaps you'll be
A	you've spent it all on
B	perhaps you'll be a good lawyer
A	legal fees no employment law's quite good though in Spain cos if you had a grudge against your employer you paid your own legal fees but even if you lost you never paid their legal fees
B	oh
A	and you never paid a court fee
B	oh
A	and I thought well that's quite good because the problem is
B	oh that's sensible
A	otherwise the employee will never take on a company
B	yes no impossible
A	because the it would be prohibitive
B	yeah
A	the court costs if you lost
B	yeah
A	so that's quite good
B	they can keep the court going for hour you know months after months after
A	yeah that's right so that's no good
B	no no good that
A	yes
B	yeah
A	this country's got it a bit wrong I think with court fees and
B	yeah
A	legal fees that actually if you're just you know the creditor like that
B	yeah
A	there's no point trying to prosecute cos people get away with it
B	no no I know we we've done several liquidations and they're always very not very nice things to do
A	no I can imagine they're unpleasant especially as most people will be completely innocent
A	and have worked hard and someone unfortunately has got away with it usually the manager
B	I know I was asked by two banks outside of erm
A	oh right
B	for some reason they got me
A	oh yes had a good name
A	yes
A	oh right mm
B	of course it wasn't Midland in your day was it?
A	er it was when I was young I think
B	oh was it? yeah
A	yeah it probably changed
B	they were the bank who we used to that's right and so they
A	yeah
B	they asked me to be liquidator
A	Coop bank's in trouble isn't it?
B	and I I found it I found it very difficult
A	I don't think it's easy even though it's nothing to do with you I mean the decision's been made for you
B	no well there's always two sides to a question always and they used to find
A	well yes but then you're not there to make that decision that decision's been made hasn't it? but the time you're called in
B	no
A	it's already been liquidated that's already been decided
B	I I remember I remember this liquidation both of the chaps involved
A	yeah
B	what do you do about it
A	yes
B	I know we
A	yeah it's not easy
A	no
B	but so no so don't get involved in those things
A	no I wouldn't like that
A	no I wouldn't want to be involved in like those kind of decisions
B	mm no no no no no
A	yeah I feel sorry for you know this steel works I mean they're
B	yeah that's on a mammoth scale that is of course
A	yes that's right and in a place where there aren't really any other jobs
A	the government's trying to save it but they don't have a buyer so short of nationalising it which they won't do don't really see what they can do
B	well they could make a they could put some money into it couldn't they? if the wanted to
A	they could
B	without taking it all over I mean
A	yes they won't nationalise will they?
B	just support it no no no
A	with
B	no no
A	like when Northern Rock was saved
B	oh yeah that was
A	people were furious
B	yeah
A	because you like I mean not that you want the poor investors to suffer but at the same the bank's been irresponsible
B	yeah
A	why should they get taxpayer money
B	mm that's right
A	and they don't have to pay that back which is incredible
B	yeah
A	I can understand making a loan but you can say and we saved you therefore you pay us back and why are you paying your top executives still?
A	it's outrageous
B	I know
A	and I suppose the steelworks
B	no
A	haven't been very responsible but
B	mm
A	top brass have
B	yeah
A	you know this has been coming for probably ten years with cheap steel from China
B	yeah
A	why are we now waiting for the eleventh hour
B	yeah
A	and then saying oh you're gonna lose your jobs?
B	I know when this firm I was acting for at least at the time when it was getting into well liquidation I suppose
A	mm
B	and the
A	oh right
B	and so I I thought well and when I looked I mean back paper after paper after paper I suddenly realised he he'd been shoving up the valuation of the stocks on
A	oh
B	so it wasn't showing up
A	they're clever aren't they?
B	yeah
A	but you wonder whether all you know a lot of financial trading is so complex
B	yeah that's right
A	and so difficult to to track
A	they they all seem like crooks to be honest
B	oh they no they are many of them
A	and they may not be breaking the law in many cases but
A	on this one they were and insider trading and things like that that's breaking the law
B	no this no this was breaking the law
A	yes
B	they were just cheating the law
A	they're so difficult to catch and most people you know even someone looking at the books it won't jump out at you straight away
B	no no they kept it what what kept it going here they kept inflating the stocks
A	oh
B	year by year
A	that's interesting
B	so that that was making and I was only up there
A	yes
B	well I suddenly realised the stocks were vastly I thought well these have gone up so much over the past twelve months I thought well how on earth did it get that high?
A	yes
B	cos I I in my mind I could see all these it was poultry stuff and eggs and all that nonsense for Sainsbury's
A	mm
B	and I suddenly realised there must've been something wrong and then then I
A	oh that's sad isn't it? yeah
B	I think actually they having said that at the end most of them saved their jobs
A	oh that's good
B	we were able to sell it off to somebody
A	oh that's really good yeah
B	yeah yeah so that was good
A	yes cos I always feel sorry for the people at the bottom who
B	yeah
A	you know they've got nothing to do no responsibility for those kind of decisions
A	they're just there putting in their time working you know as they're paid to work and then they lose their jobs
B	it it it normally takes two people to do that
A	yes
B	it
A	yes
B	the two together made a good combination
A	that's right yes it'll be difficult to get away with it on your own
B	on your own be difficult yeah that's right
A	yes although that does happen
B	yeah
A	but yes that's pretty hard
B	I think I think I
A	oh right
B	made me suspicious I thought I don't recognise this thing you know yeah
A	yes
B	and now I took my solicitor over we
A	yes
B	and when when took him over and we we we took one at a time we just took the manager when I said well what about what does all this mean?
A	yes
B	and immediately he knew
A	he was caught
B	he he he was caught yeah
A	yeah
B	and then he spilled the beans like
A	yeah that's interesting well
B	yeah
A	you remember
B	oh
A	and he used to work at The Guardian he said what's interesting about the UK is we'll punish
B	yeah
A	and surprisingly light on things like murder
B	yeah
A	or rape particularly
B	yes
A	where there are almost no prosecutions with rape actually er
B	even those yeah
A	murder more so when you've got a dead body
B	yeah
A	at least you can prove it more easily but the law doesn't really see that you might get six years for murder that's pretty much the
B	yeah
A	norm nowadays you know six years it's not much is it for taking someone's life?
B	no no for life no
A	permanently with intent
A	I don't mean running someone over because you know that would normally be an accident but
B	no no yeah didn't
A	deliberately kill someone
B	yeah
A	is pretty premeditated and irreversible
B	yeah
A	and they get six years but economic crime they'll often get ten twelve years enormous fines
B	enormous yeah twelve years yeah
A	and the government has always been really strict which says something about how we value what we value in the UK
B	yeah
A	which is a bit worrying actually
B	yeah
A	they've got a bit better lately I've noticed with murder but er the sentences seem to be longer
A	yes cos I mean six years for taking someone's life
B	yeah
A	seems a bit of a joke whereas if you look at America
A	I mean life is life there isn't it? I mean
B	yeah they have executions used to be
A	it might be execution in some states but generally it's twenty years or thirty years
B	yeah it is yeah but they've stopped executing in America haven't they now?
B	oh I see
A	cos I think they all did lethal injection
B	oh yeah yeah
A	so they refused to do it and then they sourced their drugs from elsewhere and there were a couple of awful botched executions where they didn't die
B	oh
A	and you know the heart stopped and they took I think half an hour to die or one poor man
B	yeah that's terrible isn't it?
A	incredibly inhumane cos they'd never tested these drugs on people before and
B	yeah yeah
A	it's all very well saying you tested it on a rabbit but a rabbit's not a human is it? so
B	no no
A	it might kill a rabbit that doesn't mean it's gonna kill a human in
B	no no
A	twenty
B	that's a terrible way to end somebody's life yeah
A	awful I mean no it's public there isn't it? the execution the family and the lawyer or whatever can sit and watch and er
B	yeah that's right yeah yeah
A	dreadful you know the
B	they don't have execution in the States now do they?
A	well they've stayed it in a lot of States because of this business with er lethal injections
B	yeah yeah
A	cos the EU has just said we're not selling these drugs to you any more
B	yeah
A	erm which is good
B	yeah
A	I mean that's good but I mean they're gonna get them somewhere aren't they?
B	well of course yeah but don't do they still execute people in the States then?
A	some places do
B	do they?
A	yes
B	yes yeah
A	yes yeah
B	cos on
A	no most of them don't
B	yeah yeah
A	yes I think Texas still do don't they? and they've always been a bit more
B	oh
A	gung ho yes
A	that's right don't mess with the Texans
B	have they
A	they didn't even want to be part of the States did they?
B	no they no no
A	they were the lone star yes
B	no no no no
A	yes yes so interesting
B	yes well we haven't had executions here for years I think
A	well nineteen sixties I think wasn't it the last one? James Hanratty he was the last one he was innocent poor man they exonerated him I think later on
B	oh was he?
A	and he always proclaimed his innocence
B	yeah
A	one of those I think was he? was that one of those race motivated
B	I just remember that now yeah yeah
A	even though there was no evidence I mean it was more difficult in those days cos they didn't have all that DNA
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	testing that they do nowadays but there was never any evidence that he was there
B	yeah
A	apart from
B	well they bumped him off though didn't they? yeah yeah
A	I think oh yes they
B	yeah
A	and his mother you know said he was she was with he he was with her although of course I suppose a mother might say that anyway just to protect her child
B	a mother would say that yeah yeah yeah
A	so they didn't believe her and then later they
B	yeah yeah confessed yes told his yeah
A	was you know in prison for murder and much later on he said I did it and of course it was too late he was dead the other one
B	yeah
B	well
A	well he was dead
B	no no
B	so somebody somebody
A	he might've got it
B	somebody must've got some
A	I expect his mother died before she found out which is sad
B	oh yes a terrible thing yeah
A	yes but that was one of the arguments against it though wasn't it? that
B	I do remember that now yeah that's right yeah
A	unfortunately innocent people
A	I mean even if they were in the building it doesn't necessarily prove they killed them
B	they did it no no no no
A	so you know that's not really good enough to say well
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yes
B	that's right no no
A	and then there's always the risk that the police are corrupt and are so desperate to get a conviction
B	yeah
A	that they will fabricate evidence
B	yeah
A	plant evidence er you don't know do you? cos there's been a lot of miscarriages of justice
B	no
A	what was that that one with the bombings? was it the Birmingham? what were they called? the?
B	oh yes it was yes
A	they were all innocent weren't they? they got exonerated but it turned out the police had
B	yeah that's right yeah yeah
A	fabricated
A	evidence and well by
B	they convicted too weren't they? and spent in jail didn't they?
A	they spent years in jail
B	yeah
A	one of them was just a boy who was about sixteen when it happened
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah it's cos they didn't like the Irish did they?
B	well that's right actually that's yeah
A	I mean and I suppose there's always a risk that that will happen
B	they're going to be wrong yeah
A	yes and they might not've been very nice people
A	but that didn't mean that they did that
B	oh yes there was no evidence you wonder how did they get so put down then don't you? yes
A	yeah well I think they weren't I mean they were kinda drifters two of the boys
B	oh were they? yeah
A	you know they sort of lived in a doss house and I suppose seemed a bit unsavoury they're probably petty
B	yeah criminals probably yeah
A	petty criminal to terrorist is quite a jump
A	and probably not in their best interest
A	to draw attention but anyway there as a kind of racial prejudice there I suppose
B	no no
A	and the police are under enormous pressure under those you know when those crimes happen
B	yes
A	the funny thing was with that was the IRA stepped in and said they didn't do it we did it and they still jailed them the police still jailed them even though the IRA had confessed which is interesting isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	so the police just decided to ignore
B	oh
A	what they'd been told cos they were so desperate for a conviction and by that stage they had threatened and got false confessions out of the two boys er
B	they didn't bump them off though did they?
A	no no they didn't but I mean that's an argument you know why we shouldn't have the death penalty
B	no
A	because at least I mean they're probably
B	yeah
A	traumatised but and they did spend years in prison but they did get out in the end
B	cos we don't have a death penalty now do we?
A	only for treason apparently we never got rid of it
B	only for treason?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah that's right
A	which is quite interesting cos treason could be used against terrorists presumably
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean you could say it was a crime against the state
B	yeah okay yeah treason if er
A	yes yes but we've never used it well not since the sixties and that was for murder that one that James Hanratty one
B	treason yeah
A	mm
B	it's murder seems a worse case than treason doesn't it?
A	well it does yes and then again you think
A	why why have we got it for treason and not for
B	no no
A	bumping someone off yeah it does seem very odd
B	yeah yeah it's very strange
A	yes
B	used to be funny er it's odd how people behave here cos when we used to have these prison sentences when in the day when they had capital
A	oh right
B	when they on the day of execution I mean
A	what? to watch you mean?
B	well not to well
A	or to protest
B	they they didn't actually see it but they they they put up a flag or pulled one down when it had just taken place like
A	what? were people supporting it or people against it?
B	yeah well both I think for and against yeah
A	oh right that's the trouble isn't it? that there'll be
B	yeah
A	gory sort of
B	yeah yeah
A	people who get kicks out of that sort of thing
B	yeah it was yeah some do yeah
A	so you
B	not really no no
A	no it's a bit like the old medieval days putting heads on spikes wasn't it and leave them outside the city walls?
A	it's not that different
B	no no yes yeah that's right
A	but I suppose people have always been a bit gory like that
B	yeah that's right in those days they just cut people's heads off didn't they and
A	yeah that's right
B	rather than guns
A	yes
B	cos that brought a lot more deaths when we got the gun out
A	yes
B	yeah yes
A	well the Americans say they won't do it again
A	you know the funny thing is
B	er
A	it's actually more expensive to execute prisoners than it is not to because of the legal proceedings in the States because they get an automatic right of appeal
B	oh yes right yeah they go on for ever yeah yeah
A	which they don't have to pay for
B	go on for years doesn't it?
A	that goes on for years apparently the average stay on death row is ten to fifteen years
B	yes I read about that the other day I thought that was terrible
A	it's horrific isn't it? those poor men yes well it's not all men but
B	didn't they just recently bump somebody off not very long back?
A	yes I think they did
B	well after about twenty years I mean that sounds crazy to do that yeah yeah
A	poor man yes
B	yeah that's right but have a conviction twenty years later that sounds absurd
A	he seems to have served his time already whatever he did
B	well that's right yeah yeah
A	in a way I mean you should just have a a statute of limitations which just said
B	yeah
A	if you spent more than fifteen years in prison
B	that's it yeah
A	that's it let him go
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know because it's just taking too long and that's
B	yeah
A	in itself a death sentence isn't it just
B	you'd've thought so yeah
A	waiting like that?
B	yes
A	I feel sorry for them
B	then bump somebody off twenty years down the line sounds wrong doesn't it?
A	yeah and the cost you see is it doesn't add up it's very very expensive to keep going back to court for the government
B	yeah
A	doesn't add up at all but then prison is very ineffective
B	are the countries still with? do they
A	this country?
B	no not ours
A	other countries
B	yeah
A	I suppose the Middle East still does
B	do they?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yes they
B	drugs and
A	drug pushers a lot
B	yeah
A	mostly drug pushers also people suspected of terrorist activities
B	oh terrorists well you can bump those off I suppose
A	but how but they torture prisoners in most of the Gulf countries so how many are actually rightfully convicted I I don't know I mean if you were tortured
B	oh yeah no no
A	you wonder how accurate these confessions really are you'd probably say anything after a while
B	no that's right
A	and those prisons over there I mean
B	mean prisons yeah
A	cos I have a friend out there and he works for the police as a ambulance driver
B	yeah
A	paramedic and they used to take him into prisons a lot because a lot of the prisoners
B	yeah
A	try and kill themselves
B	yeah
A	and he has to certify their death as a paramedic and he said you wouldn't believe the conditions I mean disgusting
B	yeah
A	like they treat them like animals and you would want to kill yourself and you probably would confess just to get better treatment in the end so
B	yeah
A	yes they convict a lot but how many are rightfully convicted
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	course your dad's always had an interest in prisoners hasn't he?
A	he has hasn't he? yes
B	yeah
A	yes it's interesting isn't it?
B	he did it well since he's been been
A	yeah yeah it's very interesting yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	kept it going
A	yes think I've got another booking for my Airbnb
B	oh does that? you have someone acting for you do you?
A	well it's all online goodness
B	do you have to be at home to do that?
A	yes although they're quite long April the seventeenth to June the first ah I think it's just an enquiry though that's quite a long time isn't it? seven weeks April the seventeenth to June the first mm it's a nice bit of money
B	and what you got?
A	well she wants April the seventeenth to June the first that's a month and a half isn't it? six weeks
B	oh a long time then
A	but she probably wants a deal but
B	oh
A	I suppose for six weeks I probably could make her a deal couldn't I?
B	I suppose there is a certainty what you get then isn't it
A	cos I just put my prices up yesterday and she doesn't know
B	oh well that's
A	so I could put back down to the old price for her
B	yes oh yes oh
A	and then pretend that's a deal
B	that's a deal yes that's a good idea isn't it?
A	or I could go in between
B	go in between that's right
A	cos I put it up to twenty a night
B	does she know that then?
A	yeah she'll know that but she'll want a deal
B	oh oh
A	but I could say if you're staying six weeks then I could put it down to eighteen a night say
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes that's right normally they the sight suggests if someone stays seven nights you give em a night free because it's less work for you
B	yeah
A	to change the sheets once than to change the sheets seven times
B	yeah
A	cos you've got seven different visitors and seven times letting someone in so actually it's to my advantage
B	yeah but but you turn them down if it's easy to find
A	oh yes yes I get enquiries all the time now
B	oh do you?
A	yeah but I think they probably email six or seven different houses and see who offers the best deal
B	oh right oh I see best deal
A	and then go with that one
B	course a lot depends on
A	yes yes that's right mine's new
B	if you've got some
A	yes
B	you expect to be a lower price for it
A	that's right and the location is important this girl says she's working in
B	the location's important
A	so there's no point her staying in
B	oh oh yes
A	whereas I'm on the
A	farming? probably had big farming town isn't it?
B	I seem to remember seeing that chap who was er what was he now? an MP for down that way who was having trouble?
A	oh right
A	I don't know I I didn't really follow local politics here
A	yes
B	he was doing something strange
A	oh dear well I think they all are weren't they?
B	yeah something going on I remember him I think it was
A	yes
B	course I I always find with well at least when someone's doing that one of those things they always find out immediately just tap in the name and it comes
A	yeah do you
B	I think
A	might put that in see what
B	course you've gotta you have a judge comes up cos it's Judge
A	oh was he a judge?
B	well he was a judge
A	MP
B	oh he might he was a member of parliament I suppose yeah
A	try that I
B	sounds like him
B	yeah that's it
A	that sounds like him
B	bumping somebody off?
A	it was a political sex scandal that ended the career of
B	that's him yeah that's right yes
A	erm alleged by
B	yeah
A	sad isn't it cos nowadays of course that wouldn't end his career would it?
B	no I I remember
A	and it was his colleague that was erm
A	that erm turned him in and ruined his career
B	turned him in yeah
A	nasty person wasn't he?
B	yeah I remember I remember the
A	and of a hired gunman
B	yeah it is a bit like that yes
A	none of the witnesses impressed the courts in other words they were lying and it was found that one of them would gain financially if
B	oh well that's
A	all four defendants were acquitted nevertheless
B	and we I saw him one night
A	it's very sad isn't it?
A	mm right
A	nineteen twenty-nine he was born
B	I think he'd had a something about him which wasn't quite right with er did things
A	yes
A	well
B	I have a feeling he came to one of the meetings
A	yes but I mean that that's not exactly well he wouldn't even if he was found to have been a homosexual
B	was he was he homosexual is that it?
A	well that's what it all was based on cos at that time it was illegal so that ruined his career but he was never found guilty
B	no no no yeah
A	and the defendants were found to have would've made money if he had been found guilty so they had a a reason to
B	yeah that was that was
A	smear him yeah
B	yeah that's right
A	nasty isn't it?
B	yeah I know he's yeah there was a funny relationship there
A	oh my goodness in
B	really yeah so
A	but instead he passed the job on to his associate
B	yeah
A	but I mean you would if someone ruined your career based on lies wouldn't you?
B	I I think I think yeah
B	is it? wasn't he? er wasn't he found guilty like though was he? or not?
A	no the it looks like the police removed all references to
B	oh yeah someone got him behind the scenes yeah
A	yes
B	friends of his
A	and it was a
B	yeah
A	someone said it was a cover-up no question but it suited me just fine
B	did
A	he died in twenty-fourteen of Parkinson's
B	I thought not too far back
A	well he yeah he lived to a good age mind you yeah
B	yeah yeah I he kept popping up at I
A	poor man yeah
B	yeah
A	well I mean I can
B	he's an odd chap though I think I didn't like him
A	well yes I mean he did try and kill his colleague
B	yeah I didn't like him
A	I mean not that his colleague was very nice but I suppose hiring a a killer is
B	well oh yes I think so yes
A	yes
B	it's very good for information on there isn't it?
A	it's amazing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I don't think of it enough actually enough
B	all those things you can get on there seems almost well insurmountable goes on forever
A	it's incredible yeah it really is incredible okay let's see what this girl says
B	what's that about?
A	this girl wants to stay
B	oh
A	Sunday to Thursday each week
B	is that for you?
A	yes I'll have a look on my
B	oh
A	calendar it's very good
B	do you have to reply to that now then do you?
A	yes I should do erm
B	yeah
A	cos I'll get better ratings if I reply quickly
B	oh I see
A	then it will say
B	oh
A	so we'll go and stay with her
B	oh yeah
A	yes they're sending me a photographer on Monday which is quite exciting the company free one
B	they have some company acting for you do they?
A	erm so they act for me
B	oh for you? yes I see
B	oh yeah oh that's exciting
A	so they can burn it down as far as I'm concerned my house is covered
A	if I want a new house I'll just set fire to it myself and say the guests did it
B	yeah that's right
A	well I mustn't say that must I? that's naughty
A	and I can't someone can't double book
B	oh
A	so that's quite good cos if you had to do it all yourself
B	oh
A	it'd be quite a mathematical puzzle I think seventeenth of April so it looks like
B	yes your mum's good on that she works that one quite well doesn't she? she does one of she's got one of those things
A	yes
B	you can't pick up information about people on there though can you?
A	yes should I show you? I'll show you with one
B	so you
A	okay so this girl
B	oh
A	so they've done some kind of preliminary checks and then I can click on her
B	so you have to look at that every day do you more or less?
A	well depends how often people email me but yes I'm trying to get a good rating so I'm
B	yeah
A	erm trying to respond to everything within at least within twelve hours
B	oh oh I see yeah
A	but it's good it sends it to my phone and it sends it to my email
B	oh so you've got very good probably
A	mm I blocked tonight off so no one can book tonight
B	no no
A	erm so you can block off days or weeks when you don't want to deal with people
B	oh yeah
A	so I blocked off next Friday too so she can't
B	oh yes
A	we can see that she's married from her photo
B	oh
A	and that's all so she hasn't got much other information
B	oh
A	which is seventy pounds over the market rate the market rate in
B	oh so you've got oh
A	so seventy pounds extra which is nearly a week extra actually
B	well that's
A	so er I should accept that it's lucky I put the prices up last night wasn't it?
A	otherwise she'd be getting a good deal
B	no that's right yes
A	I though oh I'll whack them up cos I'm getting lots of bookings so I though oh I'll put them up and see what happens cos I'm booked the next two weeks for five nights a week
B	that's marvellous thing to do though you you can get things settled in seconds can't you on the
A	yeah so what I can do now is send her a message back saying yes at the moment I have availability
B	yeah
A	but I am getting booked up very quickly
B	yeah
A	and then I can do pre-approve her dates and all she has to do then is click
B	but how do you make sure you get your money?
A	they do it all for me so that's the beauty of the site I never touch the money
B	so that hasn't come all
A	yes so what would happen then is they would take the money out her account automatically
B	oh I see
A	immediately they would take that out her account but I don't see that money
A	until the day after she checks in
B	oh no
A	that way if she came to my house and found it didn't exist
B	yeah
A	she could then email the company and say
B	yeah
A	I want my money back and she would get it back
B	course in a genuine case she'd
A	I suppose people do fiddle it don't they?
B	oh probably yes
A	yeah so that way they hold onto the money and then on the second night of her stay they release the whole amount
B	oh
A	even though that's a month ahead
B	yeah
A	and they send that directly to my bank account and I get it about three days later and they pay me
B	yeah
A	every week so I don't have to wait till the end of the month they pay me on a weekly basis
B	oh that's nic
A	and they take commission of about a pound a night never more than a pound a night
B	oh that's not a lot then
A	not a lot considering they're insuring me as well
B	yeah that's
A	so they're insuring me against theft and damage
A	and they're handling the bookings for me and they handle the money for me so I mean a pound a night's a bargain
B	that's good well I'm going to say you don't normally get that sort of thing do you?
A	I think it's really good I think it's an excellent service yeah
B	is it? they don't all do that though do they?
A	yeah they do it?
B	at the same
A	well the other sites
B	it sounds cheap like?
A	this this is er yeah it's quite cheap isn't it? I think a pound a night's a very good erm deal
B	yeah that sounds deal like yeah yeah
A	for for the amount of things
B	yeah
A	but this is worldwide now so I suppose they've decided
B	oh I see
A	a pound a night
B	yeah
A	if you do that across the world
B	oh yeah that's
A	and you've got twenty thousand bookings
A	and it's all online so it's not like someone's sitting there
B	no no
A	doing it you know they've probably got a staff of about twenty to manage the whole world
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah well
A	yeah they're probably raking it in
B	that's it yes happens very quickly when you've got one of those things doesn't it?
A	yes
B	do they take the money there and then on these things?
A	from her yes they take it from her
B	yeah
A	but erm I wouldn't get it till after she checked in hi
B	cos you're protected cos you've got
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and they they do have a sort of check-in place they say if the person checks in and you don't like them then contact us and we'll tell you what to do so they do have a bit of a
B	yeah yeah I see yes yeah
A	a safety thing but I suppose that's always a risk isn't it with renting your house that they might turn out to be an alcoholic or a thief or something and
B	don't know
A	don't know what you do
B	oh
A	hi I just checked the calendar
B	this is
A	at the moment erm I am free
B	I see well that's an enormous improvement having to write letters isn't it?
A	yes
B	I remember years and years ago when you
A	oh right
B	I know we had some of the early machines in our office
A	okay so I'll just save that
B	on that you you can get the cash in seconds can you on those things?
A	well they won't give it to me until the that she's checked in
B	has she?
B	yeah oh I see yeah
A	and they hold it in their bank account
B	oh so it's been done like effectively?
A	so they've got her money
B	so and it just makes satisfaction the other end and that's it yeah
A	yeah so then they just hold it and check basically that she's checked in although they don't ever email them to check
B	check in yeah
A	they just expect the customer to email them if there's a problem
A	and then after that they'll send me the full amount goodness me so it says total eight hundred pounds not bad is it? but how many months is that? I don't quite understand this actually
B	you er do you have to say accept it or not?
A	yes I'm just trying to do the maths
B	yes
A	but okay she wants to check in on the seventeenth of April let's try and do this together
B	that's not far away
A	no
B	it's the first today yeah
A	and I'm booked until then actually so she'll have trouble
B	oh
A	she can't come before that
B	how quick everything is now they go to a firm I mean it'd take days to
A	yeah this is amazing isn't it really?
A	so she wants from the seventeenth of April so let's count the weeks that's one week two three
B	do they do they enclose recommendations from somewhere to show it's okay?
A	usually
B	yeah
A	seven
B	I suppose erm
A	yes I asked her about that
B	yeah
A	having trouble working this out
B	forty-four nights it is is it?
A	forty-four nights is it?
B	is it?
A	forty-two plus three
B	yeah plus three yeah
A	okay so if we go to calculator
B	doesn't sound brilliant no
A	no but that's because I think I've put in a discount if someone books a month
B	oh I see
A	maybe I need to check that actually
B	do they pay up front on these things?
A	yeah so that's the advantage
B	oh yeah I see
A	even if she cancels
A	I would get yeah she can still cancel up to a week ahead
B	your cancellation
A	and I think
B	even if they sent the money to you
A	they hold the money
B	oh they hold the money? oh well
A	but I think I get a percentage still like fifty percent
B	oh yeah
A	but I'm not sure but if she cancels with less than a week's notice she doesn't get a penny back
B	oh
A	I get nearly all of it
A	yeah fifteen a night's not great
B	it is seven yes
A	it is yes it is quite a lot of money suppose the other thing I can do er just check
B	and
A	well no it's my fault you see because I can put in discounts but I can't really go the other way
B	oh I see yes
A	so I've put in a figure per night which is twenty pounds a night at the moment
B	yeah
A	but I've also put in if someone
B	you
A	then I'll discount them this amount because that way I know every single night's booked
B	is covered yes
A	and also that I'm not doing very much work
B	no
A	cos I'm doing is changing the sheets once a week and giving them fresh towels whereas
B	yes
A	if someone comes
B	oh you've gotta change all the time
A	a different person each night
B	yes
A	that's actually quite a lot of work and I've got to be there
B	mm
A	if she's in all the time
B	mm
A	I don't have to be there
B	no
A	but if someone's coming every night then I've got to be there to give them a key I've got to show them round I've got to wash the sheets got to
B	oh that's a bit of a nuisance
A	yeah so really you don't want people changing all the time cos it's a nuisance
B	not one night no no fifteen nights
A	but this this perhaps I don't know what to do about this
B	cos you don't don't you don't have to meet people before then? yeah so
A	no but normally they just stay a night or two
B	oh I see
A	so then you don't really mind if someone's staying much longer then I suppose you might mind I think I'll have a look at my offers actually see what I've put it in at
B	cos they if they'd paid for longer do they pay upfront?
A	erm yes they still pay but it's paid into their account Airbnb's account not into my personal account
B	I see yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	no they do it all for me
B	all by itself do they?
A	they advertise it for me
B	oh pretty good isn't it?
A	they send a photographer round for me professional one for free
B	gosh that's that's very good
A	he's coming on Monday
B	yeah so that's very good
A	and then they upload all the photos for me I don't own the photos then of course they own them
B	yeah course yeah
A	it's not bad is it?
B	very good going yeah
A	I mean the other thing is it's a three-bedroom house
B	oh yes yeah
A	so I could rent out the other room and sleep in the third one
B	oh or could camp outside
A	yes because that way actually
A	I could double my money couldn't I?
B	double your money I can see that yeah
A	because what I'm doing now is I'm renting the middle room not the biggest which I've got
B	mm
A	and not the smallest
B	oh
A	which no one's in but I could rent out
B	yes
A	and then whenever I get a booking there I could move into the small room myself
A	this is unusual but I'm getting a lot of people who want to book longer term
B	oh yeah so
A	yes I'm not quite sure about this because it's I
B	yeah
A	I probably shouldn't've put in such a big discount I want to check what I did actually
B	does that mean it's been done all now though? that whole
A	no I haven't
A	that's quite a lot less than I would be getting otherwise but then I suppose I could rent out the third room
B	oh no you no you'd be
A	yes grandpa just think
B	yeah yeah I know that's yeah that's right yes buy another house
A	I know I did think that and you know this is all tax free? the government's just changed it in this budget that you can earn up to seven thousand something or other a year from renting a room out in the house that you live in
B	yeah
A	without paying tax
B	oh
A	which is huge I mean you'd be hard pressed to earn seven thousand pounds by renting out a room
B	yes
A	have to have someone here every night
B	well well that sounds rather good
A	yeah so that's very good and even if you go over the erm
B	seven thousand
A	seven thousand you would pay tax but then you could claim wear and tear so what I'm not allowed to do is claim wear and tear with this because I'm not paying tax
B	I see yeah
A	but I don't have to put it on my tax return they said it's completely tax free and it's it's outside of the
B	oh so you don't have to worry then? mm yeah
A	and it's all through a site so if I needed to account for it I can show you know that's what I earned
B	yeah
A	here are the
B	oh pretty good going yeah
A	but that's a very nice thing I said to
B	oh
A	right let's have a look
A	calendar
B	yeah
A	and more
B	yeah it's good isn't it?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	okay so let's see pricing so I'm
B	does the money come through automatically now then?
A	ah I see that's what I've done
B	yeah
A	it will come through when she checks in so it says I've set it at twenty pounds a night
B	yeah
A	the website thinks I should set it at twenty-one pounds a night cos what it does it it calculates the average price in the area
B	oh I see
A	and based on my rating so it it's told me when I started off I should put it at fifteen and it told me go to eighteen
B	yeah
A	and last week it told me go to twenty-one and I went to twenty last night
B	oh
A	erm well I suppose the first one they just guess
B	oh I see yeah
A	and then they get the next one and then they
B	yeah
A	calculate how many bookings each place gets and they calculate the you know automatically
B	they er
A	the maximum market rate
B	oh I see
A	which is sustainable so they've worked out that for my type of property I I could charge twenty-one now
B	oh yeah
A	a night because I've had lots of bookings so they know I'm popular
B	yeah popular yeah
A	yes but I said I'd give ten percent discount on a weekly and twenty percent I said on monthly so that's why they said I should do twenty-seven percent
B	oh
A	I need to put that down don't I?
B	yes I see yes
A	so I'm gonna go down to ten percent
B	yeah
A	do you think?
B	sounds about right yes
A	ten percent discount
B	yeah
A	so then I'd get five hundred it calculates it all for me then I would get five hundred and twenty pounds a month
B	oh well that sounds reasonable enough doesn't it?
A	whereas if I did twenty percent
B	yeah
A	I would get four hundred and sixty-two pounds a month
B	oh yeah
A	if I did fifteen percent then I'd get four hundred and ninety-one pounds
B	I see it's under hundred yeah
A	so let's do sixteen percent if I did sixteen percent four hundred and eighty how does that work? sixteen percent oh no sorry sixteen pounds a month
B	I suppose eventually all that becomes automatic in your mind doesn't it all these percentages?
A	fourteen yes
A	thirteen percent discount would be five hundred and three pounds a month
B	oh
A	that's what I want isn't it?
B	beg your pardon?
A	that's what I want really
B	oh that's what you want yes I see
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yes
B	and you send it here and now on that can you?
A	oh yes and now it's changed it to five hundred and eleven pounds a month
B	yeah
A	rates that the other customers the
B	yeah yeah
A	because that is what sells products
B	oh yeah
A	and this is a product isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and once you've built up a few good reviews
B	you you
A	then stick your prices up
B	yeah yeah
A	and then hopefully you'll keep getting the bookings and they're absolutely right
A	actually
B	oh
A	the first couple of bookings came in slowly and now I've got
B	now you're
A	yeah because I've got straight five star reviews off everybody who stayed so far
B	oh that's brilliant
A	so that sells because no one else in the area
B	yeah has got it yeah
A	has got that so I've got they're getting the average is seventy-four percent and I've got a hundred percent
B	how can well how do they arrive at that figure then?
A	it's a bit arbitrary they give them some categories like cleanliness
B	oh yes
A	arrival value for money
B	yeah
A	so they give them those and then I suppose
B	yeah well I see
A	it just calculates it
B	yeah
A	five stars is a hundred percent and so on so
B	you've got you've got one of those have you?
A	I've got six at a hundred percent
B	oh well that's even better then
A	which means in the rankings
B	yeah
A	I'll go to the top
B	yeah
A	and then I deliberately undercharged a bit because then if you sorted by price I would always come out on top so whether they sorted by price or by ratings I was gonna come out the highest
B	oh well
A	but now I've put my prices up I can't do that any more
B	no well that's so you got a bit more out of it then?
A	yes
B	yes
A	six hundred and ninety-four
B	are you fully booked on the new price?
A	erm no the I was fully booked on the old price
B	yeah
