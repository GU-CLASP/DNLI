A	mm
B	why they thought something of a reading text why why the answer is what it is
A	mm
B	you know why it isn't the other A B C
A	and the others don't care they just wanna know what the answer is
B	yeah they just don't
A	that's as far as they think is important
B	yeah maybe I dunno but they've got some training
A	well since they're engineering it's
B	yeah
A	reading doesn't matter why
B	yeah
A	they'll discuss it it's got no importance
B	so how do I make that important to them
A	well you don't but
B	that process? mm I know what you mean it's
A	it's very Chinese and very very scientific as well
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	and it's not as say it's not like humanities is it where people are more open to discuss?
B	mm

B	yeah well I sent her to
A	yeah but yeah
B	but it's not the type of
A	but she's paying seven grand for this

B	next week so this Friday this Sunday
A	yeah
B	is it? is that right?
A	yeah
B	god you've got to know how to
A	so far
B	are you putting all this in your phone in the dates?
B	you're gonna start forgetting if you're doing gigs
A	yeah
B	different places and everything that's amazing it really is if you can earn a few
A	yeah yeah it's great
B	ah and everybody wants to do it?
A	yeah
B	the band
A	yeah
A	and the agency said you know I mean at the moment we're not getting paid very much
B	no
A	something like sixty quid each
B	yeah bargain I would say
A	yeah
B	are you sure the agency's gonna up the price?
A	but we're only playing for about twenty minutes
B	yeah
A	so it's not bad
B	yeah
A	but it's the travel and it's the waiting around
B	where is the wedding?
A	cos they want us to do two sets of like ten minutes each or something
B	yeah yeah when's the wedding?
A	er I well I don't even know if it is a wedding
B	you're not sure?
A	and the one on Sunday I don't know what it is someone said something about a car launch or
B	well
A	something
B	just see how it goes
A	so this could really escalate
B	yeah I know
A	it's already gone a bit crazy
A	mm and then
B	mm
A	erm he's showing some interesting in getting me to play with it cos he's in a band now
B	you can't be in two bands and it and go
A	yeah
B	all over the place
A	yeah you can
B	not if you're getting paid like
A	mm
B	four pounds a week it's gonna be hard
A	mm
B	you'll you'll burn yourself up
A	mm
B	well
A	well I'm not gonna do too much anyway cos I need to spend time with you two
B	erm didn't you try a band with
A	I didn't try anything I talked about it
B	exactly it didn't work
A	no but now he's in a Chinese rock
B	you had a meeting
A	he's in a Chinese rock band now but he didn't like it cos it was too heavy
B	oh
A	he's more of a folk singer
B	yeah
A	and he's going through this the same agency
A	so we've kind of all agreed that we're just gonna use all of us so we've got
A	a folk singer and
B	yeah
A	and an acoustic guitarist
B	hang on why isn't
B	in the other band?
A	I dunno
B	why not?
A	I dunno
B	really?
A	I think he wants to be the frontman
B	mm what does everybody think about that?
A	they haven't talked about it it's
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	well instead of splitting off into two bands can't you just be one band and then take turns?
A	dunno if we make one big band
B	then take turns at doing the vocals
A	no but
B	playing guitars
B	so has
A	mm
B	oh they're different styles?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so you've got two drummers two bassists
B	so you've got two bands
A	two
B	basically who's the
A	no we haven't
B	second bassist?
A	we haven't got another lead guitarist
B	who's the second bassist?
A	erm
B	I
A	teaches somewhere
B	I thought
A	no
B	no? he's pretty good at guitar
A	yeah well he's acoustic
B	oh I'm well I'm confused I need to come and see your band so that I know what you're going on about
A	yeah
B	or anything I didn't even know
A	no?
B	no
A	erm and then I got back here at three o'clock no half three
B	yeah oh hiccup
A	and then we sent the nanny home
B	ah
B	did you say bye bye nanny?
A	been playing with er
B	ah have you had a nice time?
A	well I thought she was gonna go to sleep but she hasn't
B	what time is it now?
A	er must be about five
B	mm
A	yeah she normally has a little nap
B	stay awake
A	what now?
B	well there's two hours we've got to entertain her for two hours yesterday I did exercises with her
B	a bouncy thing
A	mm
B	I dunno
A	what time is it exactly?
B	ah yeah it does make a bit of a difference doesn't it? like
A	I think we'd need at least
B	that would be really expensive
A	an hour and half
B	half past right that's too tight?
A	pushing it
B	okay
A	she gets really grumpy at half six
B	alright well I'll just sit here before I go I might go over to
A	yeah yeah pop over there
B	yeah well
A	it's not a good idea with your toe though
B	okay
A	you've only just
B	I know it's going to be
A	and you can get
B	sore patches too but that
A	if you bang it or it gets dirty you're
B	marching around
A	gonna be fucked
B	I'm marching around but
A	yeah but that's in a really
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you know just be toning up and stuff and stop eating Snickers
A	yeah you need to
B	but erm
A	mm
B	don't like that
A	mm
B	you wanna be able to see them
A	wanna know if they're still there or not
B	yeah
B	make sure they haven't fallen off
A	oh really?
B	yeah erm quite expensive but then if I was to buy a proper bike
A	yeah
B	so I've anyway I'm gonna have a look again and I can't remember how much they were but it's kind of like a three-wheeler sturdy
A	mm
B	it's like a sturdy one erm
A	how how big will they be?
B	well no they can go up to three or four years old five years old
A	really?
B	you can get yeah
A	what you just put them in a basket?
B	you put them in the front it's like a pram chair in the front three like a three-wheeler pram
A	you'll have to show me a picture
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so you would have to feel happy riding it
A	no
B	but maybe we won't get a pink one
A	mm
A	mm
B	but she doesn't even look like a boy
A	yeah I showed them the
B	she's wearing pink socks
A	the new class I had today
B	yeah
A	I showed them well it was on my front page and a picture of her playing the guitar
B	yeah yeah
A	and they were like ah he's lovely
A	it's a girl
B	did you say that?
A	yeah jokingly
A	well everyone thinks she's a boy cos she hasn't got any hair so that's why we have to dress her in pink
B	but she won't
B	that's weird
A	she was a boy
B	isn't it because
A	cos I wouldn't say her face looks like a boy at all
B	no me neither
A	but it's
B	and then she wears all these frills and stuff
A	yeah it's just the hair isn't it?
B	it is because she wears bows like not like not like really tacky bows but you know that those pretty dresses that she's got she wears a dress
B	they say their first thing is the hair
A	yeah it's weird yeah
B	their second thing is the colour here at home it would be
A	yeah
B	that is that's er definitely a girl
A	yeah
B	but you wouldn't say anything different would you you'd
A	yeah well you need to email that agency some pictures of her
B	yeah okay yeah well I want to do some work this evening I want to get into the habit I'm not going out until I've got my kind of a bit more of a routine going in the evenings
