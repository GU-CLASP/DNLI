A	there we go
B	yeah
A	we're recording so what were we talking about?
A	oh yeah erm foods that erm er break down er what? acids?
B	yeah alkaline
A	alkaline
B	lanising alkaline foods I don't know how you say it alkaline foods
A	mm
B	so you have some acidic and alkaline foods and basically
A	mm
B	are going to create an alkaline reaction in the body but an
A	ah
B	yeah
A	okay
B	so er lemon juice in any juice enhances the properties
A	yes
B	the
A	right
B	of the of the juice but don't mix different fruits
A	no
B	just
A	well I
B	one type you can mix vegetables but you can't mix fruit
A	got so much fruit at home it's most of it's gonna be wasted because erm
B	well the good thing is if you're making juice it can be old fruit
A	well I haven't got I haven't to a juicer
B	well some
A	but er
B	what which fruit have you got?
A	oh you name it we're got it cos erm
B	yeah
A	and he had one taken out of his back the other day and she's been getting up early in the morning and taking her friend to the hospital
B	okay
A	er organising food and she's been looking after them and er she's been up looking after her own family
B	oh
A	but erm
B	oh
A	yeah so but and they've given her lots of fruit you know cos people obviously take fruit to hospital and erm
B	mm
A	erm er a huge bunch of grapes er and
B	okay
A	and now you know
B	yeah
A	so they have a we we've got one of those today erm I said
B	yeah
A	all this stuff
B	well the good thing is er there are a couple of things you can do with the kiwis there are loads of fruits that you've just mentioned that can be blended without having a fruit smoothie maker without having a a juicer
A	oh
B	soft fruit you don't need a juicer you just need to add water or coconut water or milk but I don't drink milk so you can
A	no we're we're not allowed to either
B	you're not a milk
A	well I can't
B	coconut water
A	can't
B	or normal water
A	oh
B	and you add that and then the fruit blends anyway if it's bananas kiwis mangoes blend quite well dragon fruits blend really well
A	just mixing with water and lemon juice?
B	yeah and and a blender and a normal blender
A	well I haven't got a blender
B	oh god you need blender
A	oh
B	who doesn't have a blender?
A	I don't
B	you need one
B	oh I'm making it's just
A	I'm throwing things away I'm not buying things I'm
B	yeah
A	ah don't worry about it it's not worth it
B	well anyway with the kiwis then you can make a pulp and you can freeze it
A	mm ah
B	no that's okay you can freeze it and then when you have er you can either make ice lollies with it you can freeze it as a puree and then add it to things later
A	in when we did have a a a blender we we never used it so
B	yeah
A	ah yeah
B	yeah you're near a city
A	er yeah
B	ground floor
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh

B	I love Faulty Towers I don't think
B	I think it's timeless
A	do you?
B	yeah I do actually I think it still makes me laugh I mean it's not obviously it's about the the
A	mm
B	it's just silly
A	yeah I don't know I mean a lot of the Python stuff is er is terribly dated and erm what's his name? erm

A	Michael Palin he said so the other day
B	there isn't one
A	they did
B	they what? did they?
A	they had yeah yeah
B	oh
A	and erm they er I don't know how many shows they did but it got terrible reviews it got really panned
B	oh no
A	and er Michael Palin is yeah a lot of it was terrible
B	really?
A	mm
B	so he thinks it's dated
A	yeah well it is I mean they they they admit that a lot of the stuff they did was rubbish
B	oh
A	but of course I remember when it first came out er my mates and I we thought it was a
B	do you like
A	we thought it was a
B	do you like gherkins?
A	yeah love it
B	oh good
A	pickled penis
B	thank you
A	thought it was the the best thing ever and now now I've seen I don't think it would
B	yeah
A	you know so anything I mean we used to religiously gather round the box every time it was on
B	yeah
A	and it didn't matter what they said or did it
B	you just enjoyed it
A	yeah it was just
B	mm there we go
A	well that is absolutely wonderful
A	is er
B	that one's yours it's yours isn't it?
B	no he's at band practice
A	oh
B	oh I'm sorry for all this mess on the table
A	well I'm not gonna eat here again
A	unless you clear all the mess up
A	well I'll show you mine if you show me yours
A	I wonder what these people think that are transcribing this
B	yeah
A	well I dunno
B	I think it would be interesting
A	you have to be very good at typing
B	mm
A	mm
B	I've done discourse analysis for my
A	just had another vision from the past
A	oh I I
B	mm
A	and erm that's how I went to Loughborough yeah
B	you went to Loughborough uni?
A	no no well I did for an interview
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	so anyway they kept taking and right you've gotta go and do your exams etcetera but in the end I did I was I ended up doing a very similar course to the banking exams erm for business studies erm
B	okay
A	and I was er anyway I digress
A	in the erm bank technical college where I used to go
B	mm
A	I don't know if they do that any more these days do they?
B	erm I think so cos the people do it in the courtroom don't they?
A	stenographers
B	stenographer yeah
A	mm
B	and also with books
A	mm?
B	mm I'm not sure
A	dexterity
B	a really girly thing to do
A	well I mean it a practical aspect men's fingers are thicker and fatter yeah
A	and women are more nimble agile you know especially with their fingers
A	er
A	er I suppose it's that and also
B	mm
A	yeah? so that's why apart from the low pay that they always used to get in factories lower pay erm they used to work quicker than men
B	yeah
A	you know just putting part
B	yeah
A	and erm so in those days erm what I had to do
B	no you're not
A	was you arrived at the bank in the morning
B	mm
A	as it was called so we had to open them and then we had er compartments erm a and I all still remember them A to E er F to hand heart to J K for erm er erm we had to put them er sort them into these boxes according to er surname and our customers and then we all had certain sections to post it called posting
B	okay
A	so all the total of the debits equal the total of the credits
B	okay
A	and we started off with the statements and the statements were er no the ledgers the ledgers were the bank's copy of the transaction so we used to go and get our
B	mm
A	pull out put it in type in the balance pick up the balance go to whether it's a cheque debit or
A	can you imagine doing this all day?
B	mm
A	and then we had to do
B	bloody boring
A	and then we well it was it wasn't too bad if you made a mistake on the ledgers you could just you know put in the right amount but when it came to doing the customer's coffee copy for statements if you made a mistake there you had to do what's called a retype cos the it had to be perfect
B	mm
A	and doing this boring repetitive job you know the girls were always much faster than I was
B	mm
A	always
B	where was this?
A	in
B	god
A	Barclays Bank it's still there
A	yeah my first job
B	I had no I had no idea
A	well
B	would you like some more of this corn?
A	no I'm fine thanks
B	you don't like it?
A	it's fine
B	mm
A	erm bearing in mind I wasn't gonna have anything to eat tonight
B	oh yeah
A	er but erm
B	yeah cos you can talk to customers
A	er talk to customers and we used to have a a sub branch out at
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	you had to er make a list of all the cheques that you cashed
B	mm
A	er make a list of all the er money that had been paid in
B	add up
A	tally
B	what happened did they take it out of your wages?
A	no no it wasn't anything like that but
B	mm
A	to there was a separate account called overs and shorts and all this stuff is just coming out of mind all
A	after all these years
A	erm if it was a big amount then er you had to
A	get somebody else to come and check it and you had to make some effort of retracing every transaction you'd gone through every all the er the day but no I mean they never made you pay for it
B	right
A	well I've never heard of that
B	mm
A	you know working in the sub branch out at
B	you sound like a real gangster when you say that
A	well it was it wasn't called Zimbabwe when we got there
B	mm mm
A	or even when we left erm
B	mm
A	go and fight the terrorists and they gave us a week to find a job and on the last day I managed to find a job in a bank a standard bank in Umtali it's not called Umtali any more I don't know what they call it it's on the border of Mozambique so I found myself back in a bloody bank again
B	so you lived in Rhodesia?
A	yeah
B	I didn't know that
A	mm
B	I thought you were just travelling there
A	no
B	how long did you live there?
A	a year
B	oh
A	mm yes and no
B	why?
B	are you writing a book?
A	well
B	you should
A	the thought came to me when I applied for my erm
B	mm
A	er you know what you need for
B	mm
A	to get your visa and er
B	cos
A	and I got I mm well no it didn't well er yes mm mm yes and no I mean cos I got busted for having three seeds in the lining of my pocket
A	and I thought those days there was no contact because they they'd declared UDI you know their sort of declaration of independence so I thought
B	yeah
A	that they're completely broken with the UK
B	yeah
A	but apparently not
B	yeah
A	the records got found their way back to the UK and they're still there
B	wow
A	yeah so
A	and she said well are you sure? mm don't think so she said well does Rhodesia ring a bell?
A	I went oh my god
A	so yeah
B	yeah
A	does Rhodesia ring a bell?
A	mm
B	you might
A	no
B	The Artist's Way?
A	mm
B	she says
A	oh
B	as a kind of emptying of the mind
A	mm
B	and er she said you know two of those pages will be rubbish but maybe one is good and a book
A	mm
B	is written over a year
A	mm
B	a little bit every day so she said you know that is a book at the end of it
A	it's all cathartic
B	yes absolutely that's the the the idea it's that er it's a process not an end result erm
A	mm
B	and service to others so charity work is also in there but the being truly creative is being er er completely free
A	mm
B	so it's a really good thing to practice
A	well
B	your memoirs or you book that's great as well
A	mm
B	it's quite interesting
A	I've thought about it once and mm
A	yeah
B	no what do you mean learn how to write? what does that mean?
A	well you know you when you write a a novel or a autobiography or whatever you've gotta know how to write
B	well
A	mm
B	of how to er grab the
A	mm
B	describe things how to write a dialogue how to express feeling of course you have a better understanding of that if you read a lot
A	although
B	and of course and you you have a better understanding of what's original or not if you read a lot
A	mm
B	but I just think that actually people when they write a book they are emptying their minds
A	mm
B	even if it's fiction erm so you could as just as well speak into a Dictaphone and have an amazing book it doesn't have to be er er you don't have to be an er creative writer in that way you know?
A	mm
B	sometimes the ideas and the concepts speak for themselves and the language is simplistic
A	well the thing needs to be planned
B	loads of writers have written like that
A	no?
B	well yes and no but er not many books you know there there are loads of movements like er okay George Orwell was known to be a rather scientific writer the ideas were complex but the way he wrote was quite simplistic and in scientific in a
A	mm
B	and then you have writers kind of er oh I can't remember what period now post-expressionism maybe what was it called? the period in writing?
A	mm
B	streams of consciousness trails of thought oh James Joyce is one of those
A	mm
B	er loads of writers er very very highly acclaimed writers didn't write in a chronological way didn't write with order didn't even write with a proper story in mind you know? it was kind of stream of consciousness and that's okay too you know? and some writers er are really flowery and they spend ten pages describing a door like Umberto Eco and others don't and they're both good
A	very nice thank you
B	oh
A	mm
B	heart healthy you should make actually do you have a rice cooker? definitely
A	yeah
B	yeah cos
A	mm
B	you have a rice cooker every day
A	in every way
B	oh yes
A	mm
B	red beans or black beans you can get them here really easily but actually any beans you want er the mung beans are really good for you
A	has-beens
B	which ones? has-beens
A	oh
B	galangal roots anything
A	that's very
A	mm
B	and mix it with leaves and
A	oh really?
B	yeah beans and rice one of the healthiest things you can eat
A	right I shall try and do that
B	no oil don't need oil
A	no
B	because you you
A	that's
B	you season it with the you can use raw oil a little bit of raw olive oil is okay but no cooked oil
A	I think that was the thing that
B	the oil?
A	yeah
B	yeah it's horrific
A	cos er
B	the oil used in food
A	I I remember I made myself this huge salad which I thought oh this is healthy
B	mm yeah
A	put loads of olive oil on and er maybe it was too much well I'm sure it was too much erm
B	mm
A	and it was shortly after that that I complained about er having stomach pains
B	but what did you put in the salad?
A	oh I mean it was lettuce tomatoes onions
B	no other thing?
A	no and beans well whatever you know it was
B	the other thing that's er hard on the stomach is mixing proteins you can see I only eat one type in every meal
A	mm
B	that was only one type you only had beans you didn't have beans and cheese and eggs you have
A	well I don't anyway
B	no but I mean don't mix proteins
A	oh
B	it's too much effort for the for the body to break down
A	well
B	yeah
A	no erm
A	the bank I Rhodesia
B	yeah
A	and er in er in Umtali it was a literally a border town you know erm there were a couple of sub-branches out in the bush
B	mm
A	and we used the Land Rover and had an African driver
B	mm
A	and a
B	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if somebody had held me up I'd have said well take the bloody money I'm not I'm not gonna shoot you
A	of course not I've never fired a gun in my life
B	so why
A	no
A	I don't suppose it's for insurance possibly policies
B	mm
A	bank rules or whatever
B	mm
A	but that's why I ended up leaving Rhodesia in the end because I was due to go in the army and I didn't wanna shoot anyone
B	did you go in the army?
A	well I was due to
B	in Rhodesia?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	right and after a
B	mm
A	I lived in er a place er this widow's place and er we used to live in a well a place out the back
B	mm
A	er a hut and there was three of us out there three young guys and we used to share
B	yeah
A	and the other two were regularly went and did their army you know the a month here and a month there and that kind of thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	god
A	I know
B	so you left but why did you go in the first place?
A	well
B	why Rhodesia?
A	it's the most stupid story
A	mm
B	erm my parents died when I was young
A	oh
B	and er
A	how young?
A	mm my father when I was about eleven or twelve and my mother a couple of years later
B	oh my god
A	erm and at that time women were not allowed to buy or get a mortgage in their own name
B	mm
A	erm he put his name to the mortgage as a co-signee and the arrangement was we bought this
B	yeah
A	you know so we're all one big happy family really
B	ah
A	and I just stayed where I was and it just went on from there and that
B	and she raised you?
A	well from the age of fourteen yeah to about I don't know I stayed there till I was about well till I left to go to Rhodesia actually and then one day
B	how old were you when you went to Rhodesia?
A	twenty-two
B	oh

B	mm
A	with a power bulge in the bonnet you know and er his idea
B	yeah
A	and he persuaded me that this was a great idea and there was nobody there to give me any advice
B	oh
A	so being young irresponsible and adventurous
A	er I said yeah okay so I went to see
A	and it was it was just over a thousand pounds well actually it was thirteen hundred pounds but if you exported it you didn't have to pay tax
B	okay
A	so but a thousand pounds in those days
B	that's a lot of money
A	it was a lot of money it was a lot of money
A	I was along the seafront and the the you know it's too fast
A	oh my god er anyway it was too late by this time and then I
B	yeah
A	so I could only get third party fire and theft
B	yeah
A	and then er Roger had the idea he said well erm
B	oh
A	and then er that was great because in a sports car what happened you're driving along and suddenly the the
B	caravan moves
A	caravan started snaking and you had to slow
B	oh yeah
A	oh so this oh no so we set off erm

B	yeah
A	and we went to sort of cable mountain
B	wow

B	mm
A	and that we got er our shock we thought oh yeah two young guys sports car each caravan between us
B	mm
A	and piss off right?
B	yeah
A	but it was
B	oh
A	they changed the law from six months to a year
B	oh
A	so we had to stay for a year
B	oh god
A	and in order to stay for a year we had to register and in order to register you register for the army
B	you have to register to be in the army
A	well I
B	I mean it was an adventure
A	there was lots of adventures there was erm when I discovered grass

B	yeah
A	and that and I remember the Moody Blues
A	and er used to
A	I used to regularly get stoned and drive along these
B	oh
A	deserted roads
B	yeah cos the roads were generally were a lot easier to drive across
B	not not not busy with traffic
A	but what had happened what happened was that er Roger and I never got on really I mean we replied to each other and all that but
A	we knew that we were
B	but you were

A	and erm
B	oh no
A	I went off and smashed into a tree
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	you fucked the car
A	basically but although it was repairable er repairable er but because you know I was hoisted if you like by my own petard because we were there to try and bust the sanctions but because of the sanctions we couldn't get any spare parts
B	mm
A	so it needed a new carburettor which wasn't too bad erm we got a but it was imported from South Africa but the bonnet how do you get a bloody new bonnet? so they decided to make a new one out of fibreglass
B	oh my god
A	during this time erm I'd been posted to Salisbury

A	from Umtali so er
B	oh
A	but
B	for the drugs?

A	and erm er he was up in er Salisbury as well and er he invited me round and that's another story but erm
B	mm
A	and erm then I got busted erm it was only a thirty doller of a fine
A	you know it was no big deal but I met this guy this real character this hippy guy called
A	er in the court who had also been busted and he said come on
B	oh ah
A	and the girls black girls go for the white guys obviously
