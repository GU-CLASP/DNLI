A	so
B	mm
A	so what that means is that it's really difficult to
B	right
A	which are music files
B	right you sound very techy to me
A	no I've had to learn this
B	right sounds riveting
A	it is well er no it's quite I mean it's a different language
B	do you want some more cake?
A	no thank you
B	more tea?
A	mustn't have more cake I will I've helped myself to more tea and I will have even more tea I should think
B	that's oh no that's the horrible milk I'll get the better milk
A	no I've got no it's the good milk in
B	no that's no that's
A	oh oh for you? oh right okay erm this is ideal for me
B	no full fat in my tea
A	so I submitted all my old tapes did you tell
B	I haven't actually cos she fell and broke her shoulder
A	oh right
B	and
A	erm if you hadn't known what she was talking about you wouldn't've you wouldn't've picked it up
B	no well I don't I don't think so I mean I
A	oh yeah no if you when you know what she's talking about
B	yeah
A	then er you think oh really?
B	mm
A	crikey
B	mm
A	erm if you didn't know what she was talking about she it was so elliptical a reference
B	yeah
A	that erm you wouldn't really've understood
B	well she she's very conscientious about these things as you've gathered
A	yeah
A	you went to where?
B	I went to I went er to the physio the other day and that was jolly useful
A	oh what persuaded you to do that?
B	well I'd been well I'd been referred to this bloke before
A	mm
B	and er I didn't get on very well with my last physio cos he kept
A	oh right yes
B	and erm and so er and in the end anyway I I didn't end up going to two appointments and er was obviously blacklisted they were furious with me absolutely furious
A	was this a referral?
B	I'd been referred and then I was referred back a second time yeah I was referred for my back which is the reason well I the reason I wanted to go the er reason I asked for the referral was because I am so bloody stiff all the time I can't move and erm I really can't move any more erm I I I can't put my clothes on and things like that I've been
A	mm mm
B	can't bear it
A	just pretend that nothing's going on
B	but I can't when you're
A	sorry
B	anyway erm
A	I don't have to do that
B	erm yeah so I'd already been referred for my back and er then I ended up doing this
A	mm
B	I've been you know I keep saying this to everybody but nobody believes me you know I have
A	mm
B	in any way no I can't and I keep saying this to people and I know you know it's not a a major thing but it it makes life quite hard work and also things like I fall off my bike I fall over I I er cos I can't bend to get out of situations
A	yeah
B	I'm all so it's actually quite
A	but also if you're
A	then you can't fall properly and you can't correct yourself because you need a certain amount of fluidity and relaxation
B	yeah yeah so my daily life is more dangerous as a consequence everything is more dangerous about it so
A	yeah yeah
B	erm anyway she
A	mm
B	I guess cos of the back and erm I'm very strong on the outside
A	mm
B	but on the inside and therefore they're not being supported correctly
A	right
B	so if we can build up muscles here
A	yeah
B	actually we could probably physically rectify the stress which is oh I've got arthritis but not very bad arthritis
A	no
B	so I can probably improve the situation a lot myself
A	yeah
B	which is what I wanna do you know?
A	yeah
B	I'm not saying miraculously cure me I'm saying you know there must be a way of improving life cos again with the knee it's it's incredibly impractical you know you can't get
A	I've ended up on in a supermarket going to get something off the bottom shelf and thinking I can't get up now
A	and having to put a hand on the floor or on the shelf and
B	I can't get up I've fallen over
A	pull myself up
B	erm in the street and not been able to get up you know it's really really embarrassing
A	mm
B	erm and I've been in situations with big steps when I actually just can't get out of the situation I'm thinking oh shit what do I do now?
A	mm could be your feet as well
B	no no I've been
A	have you?
B	mm
A	cos I mean that
B	yeah but I don't know about you but didn't they just give you thick insoles which you can't get in any shoes you see that's what they did with me
A	ah they gave me a thick pair of insoles which I can er wear in one pair of shoes and when I have pains in my feet I wear those shoes and if I'm walking a lot or
B	oh you see I do have pain I do have pain but a very high arch it's which is the problem
A	oh I have the opposite I have really low arches
B	mm mine are exceptionally high
A	I think the only way you can go from there is to actually have your shoes made and have them made so that they're the right shape for you
B	oh mm well my mum's been down this
A	mm
B	and
A	you can get nicer shoes if you have them made
B	yeah it's just expensive though
A	oh yeah no absolutely expensive
B	yeah
A	but perhaps you know just one pair really or something
B	well possibly but I can't imagine
A	a treat for your birthday present
B	I can't imagine that
A	I know
B	I can't imagine that particular one coming my way but erm I found this in the charity shop it's
A	I noticed that it's really nice
B	but it's it's only size ten which is er you know it's a blow so it doesn't even cross it doesn't even erm fasten but
A	it's looks good it's a nice shape
B	oh my god it's just
A	let me feel
B	it's not the feel it's just the colours aren't the colours fantastic?
A	oh it's soft mm it really matches
B	the
A	er yes I was looking at it earlier and I couldn't work out if it was er it was brown or grey
B	I love their colours I just think their colours are every time I go in that shop and I think oh my god
A	mm
B	I love er all the colour jerseys but who would spend that kind of money? unless you had silly money I mean have you seen the prices?
A	well when your children eventually leave home
B	no no nobody would buy a jersey that expensive
A	you can have I don't know I've got a cashmere twinset which was really really expensive really really really expensive but it has lasted for twenty plus year twenty-five years and it still looks as good as new so it's not a false economy
B	yeah well there is that if you do get good jerseys it does make a difference doesn't it?
A	yeah cos the rest look so ratty so quick
A	mm
B	er I agree with you about buying good stuff but
A	oh well it's out of the question now
A	and anyway I'm changing shape all the time so I'm
B	how's your weight erm loss thing going?
A	er well last time I weighed myself I had lost twenty kilos
B	how much is that in stones?
A	I have no idea
B	sounds a lot
A	there's two point two pounds per kilo
B	sixteen pounds er no fourteen pounds in a stone fourteen
A	oh is that is that all? I don't want to do it in stone then
A	two point two pounds I think a kilo is two point two pounds so twenty kilos is ten kilos is oh no this is ridiculous this is embarrassing I'm not doing I'm sorry it's Friday afternoon and I I can't do maths
A	and I can't
B	twenty kilos is I'm just gonna look it up on the computer twenty kilos is how many stone?
A	how long are going to be gone?
B	three minutes
A	well
A	yes but then what am I gonna do? am I gonna talk to myself for three minutes? I am gonna talk to myself for three minutes
B	it's very
A	is it?
B	yeah it's over three stone
A	oh wow well good I hope it shows actually
B	well it does show
A	it's been hard won
B	well it does show three stone is pretty bloody impressive how much further have you got to go?
A	er well I don't know if I get back to my sort of erm you know my glory days
B	no no we're not going for
A	well the thing is it depends I need to get back into the clothes that I had when I was working up to the year two thousand and four and and they I can't remember even what size they are but they are my posh clothes and my expensive clothes and my really nice work clothes
B	can you not alter the sizes?
A	they're all packed away I haven't looked at them for ages
B	mm
A	because it's just too depressing I haven't thrown them all I haven't thrown them away because that would just be that would break my heart really and I used to look at them and think oh I'll never get into that but
B	I got rid of a lot of mine the smaller ones so wait a minute er
A	nine and a half
B	and what are you now?
A	don't know well last time I weighed seventy-eight kilos so I don't know what that is in stones
B	you haven't got that long to go then have you? you're doing quite well
A	no no no I'm I'm getting there it's probably another well it depends how strict I am if I stay on the strictness of the diet I've been on it should be another six months but I'm lately I'm just getting a bit tired and fed up so I haven't been as assiduous and actually
B	mm
A	but erm my dad is trying to they told they said to my dad he had to lose weight because it was a strain on his heart and of course he and my mother are taking this as being a kind of a question of defeating er you know of confounding a person in authority by by you know eating Cup-a-Soup for the two weeks before you go and see the specialist and then the rest of the time just ignoring
A	what you're supposed to be doing
B	mm
A	but anyway
B	yeah I've er I'm going to get down to my sister's gone down to eight stone eight and a half stone
A	really? mm that's
B	she's quite similar build to me she's a bit taller than I am perhaps
A	oh that's too thin then
B	which is oh er she's ridiculously thin erm it's you know she's five foot oh actually she is taller than me I reckon she's five foot nine five foot eight five foot nine
A	well that's just ridiculously thin in that case
B	so she
A	mm
B	so I've still got another stone to go
A	well it's not so much about I mean I cos I never knew how much I weighed before really it's just about whether my clothes whether my nice clothes fit
B	well I know I have to do it that way cos I have to kind of er we put on two stone completely accidentally that was
A	mm
B	I knew I was around eleven stone and then we put on a stone
A	one does one does it's very easy to do that
B	so erm
A	but also er it's it's coming off the wagon and stopping being vegetarian because erm in er and actually then not adjusting because if you put meat back in your diet and you then don't
B	you gotta cut the fat back
B	the fat as well yeah
A	straight away
B	but you had a very yeah you had a very fatty diet didn't you? very
B	but fat actually as well interestingly sort of the creams and the cheeses and the
A	yeah and pastry and
B	yeah mm
A	and stuff like that so
B	do you eat much fish?
A	no not really
B	you see we eat a lot of fish that's our
A	I'm not really very partial to fish
B	mm we eat we're eating as much fish as we can get away with actually
A	mm
B	so we eat fish er
A	mm well we have now things like canned tuna cos that's always a really quick supper and er we have er and when my day off is Friday so we have fish and chips on Friday night which is also
A	and er and then they sort of said oh with er you know with parsnips and and actually they must've made one parsnip go round the whole dining room
A	because you just got like half a matchstick of parsnip
A	it was really quite extraordinary and
B	did you
A	no not particularly
B	it's so you know I really
A	it is sad
B	I like dressing up I really do like dressing up and er you know you can't you know Christmas parties no parties ever people dress up these days
A	no
A	no
B	what I like enjoy doing I like to wear I don't know I like to wear nice fabrics and nice cut things and
A	there's somebody who's in my erm in this group of
B	it's really cheering though you know
A	yeah oh yeah
A	mm
B	the old people cos it's gets boring
A	yeah
B	it must get so boring looking at old people in boring old clothes mustn't it?
A	yeah
B	oh it's
A	oh really?
B	give me a second
A	erm have you got a
B	no
A	oh right so how do you know it's her?
B	cos it says
A	oh right okay
B	hello?
B	oh god
B	video that's very frightening here's
A	oh no it's gone off
B	has it?
A	slide to unlock
B	hello? oh god
B	crashing
unknown_female	hi
B	it crashes you see if it sees my face
unknown_female	er so you're still with
B	I am yes
unknown_female	okay er
B	are you around later at all or not? I'd love to chat
unknown_female	I'm just going to
B	oh very good where do you play table tennis? ah blasted phone keeps going down hello?
A	it might be her connection is she calling from Germany?
B	yeah
A	well it's gonna be
B	well normally she's it's really quite good it's brilliant actually this
B	last term we didn't have any contact at all
A	and so what? she's got a video on her phone as well? is it worth
B	yeah
A	is it worth doing? can you see? can you actually really see her?
B	I can't bear it
A	can't you?
A	mm
B	and actually it was very grainy
A	yeah
B	and we couldn't hear each other properly it drove her absolutely
A	just sounds as though she might be in a place where the
B	sorry?
A	it might be that she might in a place where her reception's not good or is your reception alright here?
B	yeah
A	I was er we
A	so I was late because by the time I was fiddling with it and I missed a turn off and
B	oh
A	goodness knows what
B	I do find round your area I can't get much of a signal sometimes
A	it might be that it might be the
B	yeah
A	or whether the soldiers have got some sort of damping
B	I think there maybe some
A	round the erm round all the barracks er so you can't get a signal on the barracks like in a hospital where you can't get a signal
B	mm
A	cos they've blocked it off
B	there's something like that round your area definitely
A	mm I wouldn't be at all people pooh pooh me when I say that
B	no I wouldn't be surprised
A	and also er I get this funny buzzing in my ears when I'm on erm the east side of my house
B	mm
A	and I think that there's there may be some electronic thing going on there but everybody says that er I am
B	mm oh well I trust your trust your instincts on this thing er I should think the army has all kind of weirdo weird and wonderful things
A	but I could turn into one of these barmy old ladies who believes that you shouldn't be anywhere near a you know telegraph pole or something who knows
B	no I'm increasingly increasingly anti anti technology although this has this has been very good cos er
A	mm oh
B	if you speak on the phone it's fine
A	yeah
B	cos it just feels like an ordinary telephone call
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	she doesn't normally phone me very much she's having such a nice time but erm
A	well that's that's so good I'm just so pleased about that it's just such a good decision wasn't it?
B	mm it's marvellous yeah it's er it's absolutely marvellous and she's you know she's quite proactive about things I don't know she's yeah she's changed er
A	oh dear poor kid that's just so not fair but then I don't know whether it's
B	no
A	well yes that's true
B	er because they all have different they like different styles I mean they er
A	ah
B	she said she really does reckon
A	and what happens if this other girl bombs out?
B	she won't bomb out
A	why not?
B	oh she
A	and she er she appears not to have very bad nerves and
A	and she was just so
B	yeah
A	into the performance
B	mm
A	and so engaged in everything but
B	you couldn't get
A	yeah
B	you really couldn't
A	no
B	nobody
A	whereas actually yes and erm
B	mm
A	you
B	this girl oh no no
A	her calm sometimes
B	she she doesn't like she doesn't like erm she doesn't like the orchestra so much she working with a big group of people was hard work for her
A	mm
B	whereas er
A	mm
B	the more people around the better
A	mm
B	and to be in charge of a section she couldn't you couldn't've got a better section leader cos she
A	well I know that's er that's why I'm thinking well you know is there a chance that
B	she'd be so fair and
A	you know
B	she'd be so fair but this other girl is er er er er she I know she's quite bossy and whatever
A	mm
B	and three preparing the section getting the section to do the work on it but it's it's done you have to move on
A	well I hope she gets another opportunity
B	mm
A	what's happening about her maths?
B	she's plodding on
A	is she?
B	yeah it's it's not erm
A	is this will this give her a chance to catch up a bit?
B	well only she she wouldn't get above a C if even if she worked her bollocks off she couldn't get above a C now
A	well that's alright it's a pass
B	yeah oh I'd be perfectly happy with a bloody C I tell you but
B	it's a shame because I think she could've got a B but erm I'd be very happy with a C er to get a C in German will be a miracle got to go from a U to a C
A	ah that's er extraordinary isn't it really?
B	yeah it is and she's very dismissive of it but that's cos she's so pliant about the money she gets terribly worried about paying out money I mean that's part of the problem I have with
A	mm
B	and you can't order them or she won't do the coaching cos she says it's too expensive or she won't take she hasn't got enough money on her therefore she ends up at a station without enough train fare to get home that kind of thing that kind of thing happens to
A	mm
B	cos she's so busy trying to save money it doesn't doesn't help really
A	mm
B	a good good attitude but it just doesn't help in the long run like she wouldn't have any money in her account like I like to have a hundred pounds in her account for when she needs money urgently for an audition or reeds or something turns up and otherwise I have to be available at
A	mm
B	it would've been an awful lot easier for all of us
A	mm
B	erm but anyway we'll see
A	mm so where is she at school at the moment?
B	yeah she's got an orchestra course she's doing they're doing this concert actually and erm in
A	oh right oh yes
B	with the girl who's got her place in the orchestra
A	oh
B	so yes so we
A	do you think their friendship will survive this?
A	mm
B	but then er the girl worked out why
A	oh no
B	it's funny but er
A	that's er
B	anyway her teacher her teacher was very good and
A	poor kid
B	her old teacher was really good she we brilliant actually she couldn't couldn't get hold of her teacher this is when you realise they're such fantastic human beings she couldn't get hold of her current teacher so she rang up her old teacher and she's so brilliant at sort of putting it all in perspective and being sensible about it and calming
A	that's good I mean will will it help that she did it for a year?
B	oh yeah yeah no it does help yes you can two years
A	you can you can you can present it that actually for
B	you wouldn't want you couldn't lie cos they all they work with these people er all the time people would be able to tell
A	well in which case everybody will know that there was a change of policy or that there was a decision made so
B	well no it wasn't exactly it wasn't as it's not as clear as that they never tell you er it's a very strange email they send through they
A	mm
B	so they said it's a
A	that's very weasely
B	it's very weasely it basically gives them
A	and how are they to say? erm I suppose that that you know that's kind of sop cos you're
B	it's weasely
A	that actually I've got eighty per cent of the value I can get out of this and another year would only give me another twenty per cent and therefore somebody else would
B	but then on the other hand they're saying it's completely meritocratic
A	yes
B	so it's not really it's
A	no it's not meritocratic is it?
B	no
A	how can?
A	no it's either meritocratic or it isn't you can't have meritocratic er mitigated with some other factor
B	exactly
A	because then it's it's
B	yeah er but er it it er
A	really?
B	yes
B	and erm er we know many stories whereby a teacher would say this is the most definitely will get in this person hasn't got a cat's chance in hell and then that person that hasn't got a cat's chance in hell will get the position and the other one won't so it is very idiosyncratic
A	mm yes
B	they never give you any rationale you never know what's really happened there's quite a lot about personality in fact
A	mm
B	I mean if
A	she was winging it again
B	practise it she was winging it yeah
B	and and you know that was a reality to that and it it was a terrible shock but er you know there was some reality to it
A	mm
B	erm anyway
A	I don't know perhaps it's better if you have an experience like that somewhere along the line when you
B	it is you have to have it you have to have it
A	mm so it just teaches you what happens
B	well you have to
A	when you don't
B	you have to be robust enough to deal with the knocks you can't be a musician and many many good musicians fall by the way at this stage
A	yeah
B	or at music college cos they can't can't cope with the rejection if they've always been the best
A	yeah
B	and suddenly they start getting knocks
A	but then on the other hand this is where it starts getting serious because it's
B	no no no
A	and the transition from gilded youth to hack must also be
B	it's a really rough transition
A	yeah
B	it's really rough and and and interestingly now I've gone through it with the kids I think it's more interesting because
A	mm mm
B	you know it's they are adults in their playing
A	mm
B	from the age of fourteen onwards
A	yeah
B	and then as you say they just become any old hack who's sort of hired for a pittance to do you know play a tune
A	mm yes
B	and it
A	and nobody notices you again and actually you're probably sitting in the dark most of the time
B	yeah
A	cos erm you know you're just you're just at the back and super you know just I don't know just
B	well that's why
A	you might as well be playing the triangle or something ping
B	but it's a society unto itself I think the musicians all appreciate each each other so
A	oh yeah there must be a benefit there must be a benefit to it I mean I suppose I don't know
B	yes it is an artist
A	any any other kind of performing really that that actually the comradeship of your peers and being part of the little
B	well they know whether you're good or they know whether you're good or not
A	yeah no
B	and you are creating music and er you know you know whether you're doing it well or not
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	for
A	yeah
B	it was about it was a personal thing
A	no
B	it was
A	yeah and what was really nice when we went to that concert is other people seeing other people around going oh that's
A	when we went up to the
B	oh
A	Adès?
B	yeah
A	is it Adès?
B	yeah
A	and I really liked that music
B	I oh I I we saw erm the Tempest which is an opera by Adès which I think is bloody brilliant it's it's a film you
A	mm
B	it's it's quite weird but I thought it was wonderful
A	oh right
B	yeah well mm we shall
A	mm
B	and it's huge and she's doing that in December so she's got big things coming up
A	oh well that's good
B	so it's yeah
A	and what did you say erm that erm what did you say that
A	oh right
A	and is
B	no
A	no cos he's on holiday
A	doesn't he?
B	no
A	mm they were down at our house the other day mending the boiler again again something else went wrong but it's a three-way valve and they always go wrong it's very boring indeed it drives me bonkers you wake up in the middle of the night and you think what's that noise? you think it's the boiler what is the what time is it?
B	mm mm yeah they are annoying we when we do the kitchen we need a new boiler I guess
A	how far have you got on with?
B	nowhere
A	nowhere?
B	we've got the plans for
A	oh
A	oh it's frustrating isn't it?
B	to be honest there's quite a few things we have to do ourselves and we're not progressing with those you know we've got to change some guttering we've got to move a flower bed we've got to empty the sheds get rid of the sheds you know there's quite a lot of stuff we have to do
A	mm
B	which erm we're not really addressing at the moment we've got to get
A	no it's very frustrating
B	skips in and we've got to actually
A	it's very satisfying getting a skip
B	I know well I want to get one now cos it's the only way I'm going to get
A	mm
B	erm but that is a huge relief cos we did a whole load of old carpets and god knows what else
A	oh that's terrible and you imagine that they're still gonna be alright and you look at them and you think
B	they probably would've been alright but you know there comes a point when you just don't have the will to lay these things do you?
A	no and actually also we rolled up the carpet in one room in our house to put to to put the wardrobe in new wardrobe what I didn't realise is once you've rolled up the carpet the last thing you should do is walk on it because when the guy came round and I said oh can you relay that carpet he said no I can't cos it's all creased up if I lay it now you're gonna have to call me back in about three weeks' time because when all the creases have have unfolded from it again it will be too loose so therefore you have to lay it back down and not pin it down for the next sort of three or four weeks and when call me back after that when all the creases have gone and then I'll then I'll pin it back down again
B	mm
A	that and he sort of said has anybody been
B	no
A	they're not rolled down to a piece of cardboard like they were in the first place
B	no
A	they're just sort of sloppily thrown up there likewise lino
B	and the other thing well
A	oh yeah
B	but erm the other thing is I suspect this bloody project is gonna end up er exponentially must more expensive than we'd anticipated
A	mm
B	because actually when it comes to it
A	is that his knees as well?
B	it's just time hasn't go the time erm
A	mm
B	you know er
A	er
B	I don't find anybody I trust cos the cos I've had a back problem I'd only want to do it with somebody I really trust for massage
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't go for a general massage cos some people can
A	yeah
B	and there are people that that are good but I would only go on personal recommendation
A	yeah no quite but I was wondering if that might help really
B	it's expensive expensive
A	yeah all these things are expensive
B	but actually that's what my mum used to do thinking about it she did yoga massage and she that helped her with her stiffness so perhaps that is something well I'll try these exercises and see cos I've been doing quite a lot of swimming recently and I thought well it has helped I have got
A	well that
B	well yeah but it it actually hasn't helped on the lower back it doesn't hasn't er it helps in terms of pain and it helps in er terms of general strength but it doesn't help it has helped to a certain extent with the knee but it hasn't helped getting up and dressing and moving around type things
A	mm mm
B	so er
A	and when was the last time you had a new mattress?
B	er fifteen years ago it was a good one
B	well I know we've been thinking about that we probably do need a new mattress
A	my actually er my er cos er
A	I
B	mm
A	for such a long time and I just had a permanent hip ache so I had to go on my left-hand side and in the end I had to say to him look we will have to get we'll have to get a softer mattress so we did get a softer mattress
B	why don't you do er
A	and then ah well no and then we had erm and then we got a softer mattress still wasn't enough and my hip was still bad and then in the end I bought a
B	ours was an incredible expensive bed we bought
A	mm
B	because actually interestingly as you say we have were having a terrible time and I was in agony at night and hadn't slept for years and we were
A	yeah
B	it's it's difficult to know whether we
A	well the thing the thing is
B	yeah you see I can't do anything like that at the moment cos I fall over
A	no but it helps with that it's been proven scientifically proven don't give me that look
B	no no no
A	scientifically proven in
B	I'm not very good at
A	no it is a pain in the arse
B	I I erm I I'm not a very groupie person
A	you can get Youtube videos and you can get
B	yeah I'm not
A	oh yeah no yeah that's very
B	it's really
unknown_female	yeah
B	it's twenty past five
unknown_female	I know
B	come on homework it's gonna be a nightmare otherwise tomorrow come on
B	I've bought some Kitkats for tonight
A	and you're not having one unless you've done your homework
B	but you do need to get some homework done
A	no shame bribing your child with Kitkats that's terrible
B	well I er I I er I bring up
A	chock-a-block with crisps sweeties
B	crisps everything the lot
A	she's a different animal that girl she's been that way
B	and er she she's on board now with packed lunches
A	mm
B	she
A	well if she as long as she eats something
B	exactly
A	just eat anything girl
B	well exactly I came to the point where she was eating a lolly for lunch you know it is better than a lolly
A	yes quite
B	erm
A	she's got the will of a
B	yeah
A	stubbornness of a whatever
B	she's quite funny actually cos for somebody who doesn't really take school very seriously she actually does do her homework it's quite amazing to me I haven't had any kind of detentions for not doing it or anything
A	oh that's quite good cos she's not yeah she's not actually getting detention she's not actually you're not actually being hauled up
A	to have little you know discussions with the headmaster about you know
A	ah right okay
B	but I haven't
A	yeah but then on the other hand actually that's the worst possible thing that could happen to her because then she'll just turn out to be a monster when she's thirty cos she'll she'll just be expecting people to stay out of her way
B	hi darling
unknown_female	hello how are you? are you free to talk?
B	I'm not free to talk at the moment I've got

A	bye
A	what are you cooking for tonight?
B	er salmon and chips we er it's the
A	oh right
B	it's the only reason
B	we're creatures of habit we are
A	ah
A	doesn't he?
B	no no
A	god he's such a nice man he is so nice
B	he is a nice man he's very nice he's quite funny he doesn't er
A	very very conventional mm
B	traditional yes very conventional
A	but that's well that's
B	he looked after his father who had
A	oh did he really?
B	mm
A	er is he he's not married? is he not married?
B	he was married
A	oh
B	and it didn't fall apart anything to do with him
A	oh
B	it was very sad he was very in love with her they met when they were about fifteen I think and erm
A	mm
B	she just went off with somebody else but
B	they had two children and whatever and he he has girlfriends now and again
A	oh well that's mm okay
B	but he was a very
A	mm
A	mm
B	so mm
A	he's just about started speaking to me he'll talk to me now
B	doesn't talk to me you see at all
A	no he'll talk to well he'll talk to me about boilers and stuff not not anything about anything
B	they're men's men
A	and they might as well not bother I I was er saying to I nearly felt like saying to them why are you talking? there there's no point talking to him and in fact they left him instructions as to how to clean the filter and I think he probably he
B	I'm getting more impractical you see cos living with
A	mm
B	I used to be quite a practical person not at all now
A	no well I suppose it's very easy to leave it to them but erm but anyway erm did you say that
B	yep buried
A	is it? don't throw it away
B	no no he wouldn't give it away
B	that's what that's what
A	oh right oh right okay
B	so
A	oh right I'll have to bring in my things to show you
B	mm
A	I I was quite pleased with them actually
B	mm
A	although it was so tiring we were just discussing today with the others about how our brains don't work properly any more since we had chemotherapy
B	mm
A	we're all in the same boat it really really fries your brain so it takes such a long time for you brains to come back and by the end of Tuesday and by the end of Wednesday I was so
A	tired
B	it's what
A	that er
A	and the man's going no no not like that no not like that no not like he's he's very very patient and but I'm gonna have to have some more classes and not do all day just do half a day at a time because by the end of the day I was just completely
B	expensive hobby though isn't it? it's very expensive these classes
A	it is an expensive hobby
B	mm
A	but the thing is that if you erm once you've got the tools and once you've got your own stock of wood it's fine
B	once you've got the tools
A	I know the tools are very expensive
B	and you can buy endless tools
A	really?
B	he'd think I wouldn't notice
A	well we only use four? five? different tools
B	no
A	has he?
B	mm
A	well it's the lathe that's the most expensive I should imagine you pick up the tools if you if you er kept an eagle eye open cos I've never you know I wouldn't've known what I was looking at
A	is he really?
B	yeah
A	I need to pal up with
B	yeah she's got a bit better recently
A	has she?
B	I had a couple of evenings which weren't quite so bad
A	she is weird
B	yeah she she can be very strange
A	she was very weird at your party
B	mm she gets very nervous I think that's partly it
A	I think yes it was kind of she was
B	mm
A	well that's really nice but she's got one of what we call a Muttley laugh in our house
B	a what laugh?
A	Muttley laugh
B	what does that mean?
A	do you know like Wacky Races on the television when we were young?
B	yeah
A	it was a cartoon
B	yeah
A	and there was a racing car driver who had a dog called Muttley and the dog would go
B	oh yes
A	it's a particular kind of weird laugh that people have
B	mm
A	so she was very much like that
B	mm
A	so anyway we can stop in a minute it's nearly there you do realise you've helped me to earn twenty quid? near enough fifty-two minutes it's only a few minutes to go
B	I don't
A	and and I keep saying I really don't know
A	well it's not that it no it's not that it's not that actually
B	it feels like
A	no I tell you what
B	we very rarely we very rarely ask people to to come down and I guess cos it's so such a
A	mm
B	and erm I guess it may not be like that for other people and and er I guess er I can quite easily take offence actually when people don't seem
A	no no no I I tell you I can tell you exactly what the problem is first of all
B	mm
A	secondly I was supposed to go to hospital on Monday for an appointment and then thirdly there's that weekend which involved taking the Monday off work now Monday's at work for him are really big days they have really big meetings with the permanent sector on a Monday and with all the senior managers and stuff like that
B	well that's why I'm saying just don't don't bother come a different time
A	so no no no no no well that it won't help because it'll be always be a Monday but because erm
B	no it won't always be a Monday er it is this time cos of the half-term
A	mm well okay okay but er because my appointment was cancelled and he went into work this Monday he then relaxed a lot more because he thought that out of four out of four Mondays in the month he was taking three of them off which er leaves him quite vulnerable because that means that he's not in the room when really quite big decisions get made about his work
B	well I quite understand that
A	and stuff like that but because I didn't have a hospital appointment on Monday
B	yeah
A	it means that he is now far more relaxed
B	but even so
A	about
B	even so we
A	no no no no no that's fine now he's all square and but also he's just been he's been arsey about he's just being arsey he's being arsey with me that's the point he's not being arsey with anybody else he's just being arsey with me and also maintaining also the other thing of course is he maintains it was the first he'd heard of it well actually I then found a note of a phone conversation he's had with you where it was quite plain that he'd talked to you about it he swore blind that this was he'd never heard of it before but which is just him again being arsey with me really but erm so the Friday
B	yeah er I think we will drive down in our car so if you drive over here
A	mm
B	we wouldn't leave before probably eight I think not early
A	eight what?
B	seven seven thirty at night
A	at night?
B	seven
A	not in the morning?
B	yeah no no no no on Friday
A	oh well that yes and oh right okay
A	oh right okay to avoid the traffic and everything
B	yeah
A	okay oh well that makes that puts completely different complexion on things as well
B	I think probably seven thirty
A	okay
B	I'll talk to
A	oh well no that's fine
B	mm
A	because that's fine
B	wouldn't be earlier than seven definitely
A	okay oh no cos the other thing about him is he's extraordinarily conscientious I've left him at home today and he will've worked all day without stopping he was at his desk at eight o'clock this morning and he will've sat there absolutely all day and he won't've
B	mm yeah
A	oh no that makes that makes it very much easier as well
B	but I I wouldn't do it if it's if it's difficult
A	no it's not that it's no it's not that it's difficult it's
A	that's just leading him to be an awkward sod really no no he'll be
B	we just go we haven't had many well
A	right
B	and in fact it's better for us this way round because
A	when you say full waterproofs?
B	er oh just a mac
A	I've got that is that enough?
A	that says waterproof breathable
B	I'll I'll bring you a spare mac with me you can I'll bring another one with me just in case it's not as good
A	and I have got
A	I have got proper walking boots
B	yeah and erm probably be helpful if you brought have you got erm double sheets? just for an ordinary double bed
A	yeah yeah
B	so if you bring a bottom sheet and a duvet cover and pillow cases that's probably a good idea actually bring pillows
A	okay
B	cos the pillows are not fantastic there are pillows there but you might want your own ah no bring pillows it's a good idea to bring pillows
A	okay
B	erm
A	we're fine with blankets really I'd
A	okay
B	and erm er we get there about ten thirty at night and we'd light the fire and then we would Saturday morning we are collecting
A	mm
B	if you're interested I don't know if you've been to
A	er er er not for
A	not for decades not decades and decades
B	we might go
A	alright okay yeah
B	erm
A	and last time I went to
B	er and then er so we'll probably do that in the morning
A	mm
B	and then collect her at eleven oh I don't know how we're gonna do it actually maybe we'll
A	mm
B	on Monday well mixture basically of I don't know
A	mm no that sounds really nice
B	mm
A	haven't been that way for a bit
B	yeah
A	we had a holiday in erm just between
B	you've only been to the old cottage haven't you? you haven't been to the new one?
A	no I haven't seen the new one
B	the new one's different it's erm
A	mm
A	mm well it's such a long time since I was there that erm
