J	image and style but with like this another slogan on the back sort of saying this is all a load of rubbish or something like they or some some witty turnaround of what of of what the em the title of their mission was
D	yeah yeah
E	did they all have em different coloured hoodies and things this because it changes from year to year sometimes
J	it does
E	sometimes they realise that if you have them all as the same colour then it just looks like an army of people

J	yeah
C	that's true
G	I think it's green this year
D	yeah it's green and it's for a life and there's a it's a heartbeat thing

A	Ganglike
J	Ganglike yeah maybe
B	yeah
D	mm
J	that's true

C	mm
E	if they made them different colours they would be less ganglike
C	yeah
H	variety of colours yeah
D	mm

H	is that what the Vikings would have said? Would they have used that that terminology?
I	if it's good enough for
D	em  speak Old Norse things for the
I	yeah
D	no
I	I think  I think  that is something you need to get into
D	em does it you sort of find things in GPS over GPS

A	coordinates
I	coordinates of a box or treasure

G	oh yeah maybe our boiler will break
D	it was seven in my mum's classroom at eight o'clock on Friday morning
B	if your boiler breaks does that mean you
A	Seven?
D	Seven degrees in the classroom
A	ah yeah
G	yeah that is illegal
I	that's not legal definitely
B	I'd say are you sure you're just going to end up  very very cold
C	that's why Saturday got cancelled in during January cos the boiler had broken
E	well the legal is it has to above fifteen degrees within an hour of starting work
I	it has to be over fourteen doesn't it to pass em?
G	does it?
B	actually it's not anymore
A	my uncle though was saying that one time when he em was at school em the boiler had broken but they thought they you know everyone
D	so they used to have to bring in industrial heaters into my brother's school all the time because the boilers just broke constantly
A	wow
D	so they had these massive engines like in the  school sports hall just trying to heat the entire building but
E	yeah I remember just sort of it was cold one day at school cos the heater broke and I went home and em like there's
H	kids are always going to want to go home
J	yeah
I	and teachers too
B	and the teachers do
J	yeah
D	more than the kids I bet
C	I'm trying to think what else
H	I imagine the kids totally will be really hoping schools close tomorrow
B	the kids  the kids  aren't allowed to go home
C	oh yeah
B	since kids are
H	and
J	yeah well
E	well since kids aren't actually at work at school the kids can't go home if it's cold like legally

B	in the
A	we said special but
H	that was my first ever job
G	oh
I	what did you do?
H	it was a small
D	mm
H	up in
G	you look very proud in the picture
H	I learned lots in
I	were you the office baby?
H	em no she was younger than me and he was younger than me
J	by like one year or
I	so
A	can you name them all?
H	em
D	he looks a
J	mm
H	but
C	mm
B	how do you go about doing that?
H	Google
J	yeah
B	what what
J	yeah yeah oh
A	or an email like
J	mm
I	lovely crumble
A	mm lovely crumble
H	I didn't make it
J	it was going be handmade but then em we had a little accident with the apples so it's now Waitrose made
H	I suspect they're edible but so the bags weren't airtight they were in a brown you know
B	well I think there's
I	so are you having the whole church over for dinner? Rather than actually
J	yeah
H	we could start at A
D	yeah
H	everyone with A
C	eh
H	no
B	what can I think of beginning with A?
H	no more more the whole church
G	mm
J	that would be two hundred and eighty adults
E	are they that many?
J	yeah
I	six months
D	yes
I	I would say if you want to have the whole church over for lunch you have the whole church
H	or we could do a barbeque for them
J	yeah
H	paved it all
J	paved the whole thing
D	grass
H	I can't grow any vegetables
J	there's nothing there's not a single thing out there to grow
E	can you remember what some of the
J	em I dread to think
H	I've never been to their house
J	oh my word it's
E	the  into the paving
D	really?
E	yeah
C	mm
H	really? What rats or something
J	well I remember going there the first week they bought it
E	I don't know bags of white powder
H	really? Wow
J	but when you but they used to have a
D	really?
H	it's not enough to put back so
J	mm
G	what did they do with the drugs that they found and stuff?
J	they contacted the local police station and someone came around to look and said it's insignificant and
B	we're not gonna charge you
B	actually yeah cos presumably if they bought the property the drugs came with the property
J	oh
H	I think I'd have been tempted to just flush it down the loo to be honest
C	mm
E	why? Guilty conscience?
H	em
I	just starts opens a can of worms doesn't it?
H	precisely
D	yeah
I	can just?
J	yeah
H	I mean obviously you'd be particularly stupid to call them in if you were still dealing or something but
E	yeah
H	nonetheless
I	they think em
E	then they'd have your fingerprints all over it
D	yeah
I	they think eighty percent of credit cards have traces of cocaine on them
J	really? No way
C	yeah and most bank notes as well I think
H	yep
G	how do credit cards have traces of cocaine?
I	Cos when someone uses a credit card
I	to line and then they go to the shop
H	chop it up with your credit card
E	and put it in the machine and then you put your machine
G	oh I see
E	your card in the machine
D	mm
E	and used cars as well
G	why?
H	what have?
G	used cars
I	used cars
A	mm
G	I have a used car does that mean
I	people use cars
E	surely only Audi's BMWs and Mercedes
J	is that like one of those statistics where like
I	yeah six yeah six spiders
G	and you eat yeah
J	oh
H	that company we had a company car and it was a BMW with em tinted windows
H	it was slightly scary driving in certain areas in Birmingham
D	yeah
I	I think I'd prefer to have tinted windows in that sort of area
J	ah that's true
I	whereas they would just think it's you they're more likely to hijack or I nearly got hijacked the other day
H	you got hijacked?
I	no no well there were some people doing some spins in their
J	no
G	what did you do?
I	I drove off
I	fast as I could go
H	reversed at the high speed
G	did you have to reverse?
I	no I went round them
J	how weird
G	that's terrifying
J	that's awful isn't it?
G	I I had a really bad incident on the way home from work on the A fourteen
H	people are so stupid
unknown_female	horn
G	horn
J	oh I hate when people do that
G	and I had to slam on my brakes and I was really worried because I had a lorry behind me and he took the next exit off anyway
J	oh
H	people are just so stupid
G	and I don't know what I wasn't doing anything wrong like
J	no no not at all
E	what he overtook you to brake test you?
J	well yeah
G	he he probably wanted me to go in the back of him because if you go into the back of someone you're
I	it's your fault yeah
G	your your it's your fault
H	but then you'd have reported him
G	yeah
C	yeah but then that would have slowed him down as well
G	yeah
E	cars like doing that
J	yes and then you just go in front
G	yeah
H	this you're allowed to do
J	yeah
I	Don't get me started Ed
I	I I'll happily openly admit I will block a cycle lane if I think it's unsafe for a cyclist to go in front of me
J	yeah
H	that's fine
E	I don't go in front of them
D	yeah no I was
B	you see I'm I'm I'm with you
H	yeah
G	but he could just ram you off the road
D	yeah well I almost happened the other week
B	but he won't
D	Cos I was cycling down and the same taxi pulled out like just suddenly pulled out and then as you know there's a cycle lane
H	unless it's that bloke that was behind you
G	yeah
H	I bet that
D	yeah
H	and say do you realise how badly you were driving? No no no I wasn't I was driving really well and then show them the video
D	yeah
H	and they'd realise
B	no
D	he would
H	because the recent somewhere just over there the other day I was turning right
C	yeah
H	A white van cut it up and just imagine him saying cyclists are all terrible terrible and you know
A	I have a friend from em Spain and he em he and his fiancée were driving one day in the countryside and eh
H	in Spain or?
A	in Spain yeah
B	are you serious?
A	yeah yeah
J	yeah
A	he'd have to kill someone at some point
J	oh no
B	but why why did they take him off in a black van that seems a very
D	really dodgy
A	I know  I know  absolutely mad yeah
B	it doesn't seem  it doesn't seem  to be factual
A	but it is Spain
J	are you sure it wasn't like official? Maybe it was what what's the Spanish one ETA?
A	but like so mad like she didn't get like any explanation of where he was going
J	that's a bit odd
J	do people want to go and grab a seat out a more comfy seat and stuff and em?
A	yeah
B	once I was cycling down Milton Road and just
