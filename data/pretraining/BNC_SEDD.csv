A	basically I was in French by myself because we were really early from assembly and I was sat there
B	in the mobile?
A	yeah and there was two classrooms
B	mm
A	and then
A	cos I don't like waving to people
B	what was she in the class opposite?
A	I think so but she was standing in like the little lobby bit with
B	what were you just sitting down on your own?
A	well no because like
B	oh
A	and then I was just looking at the door and she was there and I was like she was like
B	oh
A	she waved at me and I was just like mm and she sort of smiled and but we were on the other side of the street so it's really awkward it wasn't really like waving distance cos you know when you're really close to someone
B	mm
A	and you wave?
B	and when it's really far away you can't tell if they're waving at you
A	yeah
B	or someone else in your direction
A	and that's really depressing when they're waving at someone behind you and you're like
B	you turn around mm
A	yeah he's like what? and I'm like not talking to you
B	yeah
A	yeah but I don't understand because I'm not actually looking at him like he's there and I'm looking past him like he can't he see that cos if I was talking to you and I just kind of started yeah so how how do you
B	yeah
A	I don't understand
B	cos you're not even looking at him
A	and I'm not having a conversation that I would be I'm like yeah hi and he's like I didn't say anything and I'm like yes cos cos I'm not talking to you I'm talking past you and then everyone on that table is like what?
B	I really didn't get that thing in maths when she was saying that the exact dancer thing she's so annoying
A	I know and then she was like I really don't understand why I bother teaching half the people in here and I was like ha ha
B	well
A	she always says this to me cos I'm just sitting there
B	then don't be a teacher
A	and I'm just like ha ha ha ha
B	she's so annoying
A	and then I'm like and then she's like about to tell everyone off and I'm like Miss can I just can I just go to the toilet now?
A	cos she was like I was like can I go to the toilet? and she was like no I was like why? and she was like well you've just had the whole of lunch and I was like yeah but I didn't need to go at lunch and she was like what so you've just had the sudden urge to go when you were walking up here? and I was like yeah and then she was like oh as I was sitting there doing that sheet I was like I really need a wee
A	and then I finished and I was like Miss I'm finished can I go? and then you didn't even notice me leave
B	yeah sorry
A	I walked right past you I looked at you and you were just like
A	and I was just like oh alright then
B	yeah probably cos
A	oh my gosh and then today in English she goes I can't read like well yeah you're the one that said that you read like half a page in nine seconds so like that would never happen and she literally went
B	yeah and then how it goes seven eight nine ten eleven
A	yeah
B	seconds
A	and then like ten nine eight seven and I'm like what?
B	how can you read that fast? you can't read that fast
A	exactly
B	that's stupid
A	and she goes oh yeah well basically if I get my phone taken off me I'm gonna just give them the old phone cos she didn't even
B	yeah
A	like she didn't even
B	like she chickened out just shove it in my pocket
A	because what I would have done is put it in my pocket and she'd be like no give it
B	and be like give me a go
A	and be like fine then and give her the old one like what's the point of just being like cos if she's like give it to me then she could just be like like that and then she'd be like give it to me and then you'd be like
B	yeah and then give the old phone that that's really a good idea
A	that is a good idea
B	if you actually do it yeah
A	but then what if they see like you that you've got an Iphone six and you hand over an Iphone four?
B	mm don't wanna
A	that's not
A	and then but my Iphone four is dead maybe I should just bring my Iphone four to school? yeah but I completely forgot we weren't allowed to use it like in between lessons
B	yeah
A	and so she was like
B	well why does yeah why does she always know my name why does she always call me
A	yeah it's cos you're like the famous
B	yeah she doesn't know
A	no I'm sure she does cos I'm sure all the teachers were in a room and they were like hurray for
B	yeah
A	and I'm sure it was cos I'm sure they were all like
B	so embarrassing
A	and like every teacher came up to you and
B	yeah
A	yeah they were like well done in the maths and you were like
B	because I was like because it was like twenty out of fifty and it was like how is that good?
A	yeah cos she just goes your results well done
B	yeah
A	and then I was like congratulations and you were like er what? and
B	I was like I got twenty
A	so you know you got a distinction? and you were like actually no and every time
B	I need to get

B	I think so but I don't know
A	and
B	how do you spell
B	mm maybe
B	it's quite a hard one for spelling
A	today in French
B	do you want some more water?
A	erm yes please cos we've got speaking controlled assessment in like a month she was like so guys we need to
A	we need to practise
B	yeah
A	nobody said anything and we were all just like
B	mm
A	and she was like the silence is deafening
A	and we were like and she was like come on guys you're not gonna get better unless you open your mouths and we were all like
A	and she was like
B	like
A	yeah and she goes
B	open your mouth
A	right okay come on
B	yeah
A	this one's a bit tricky this word right okay ready repeat after me and she made us just us two like repeat this word and she was like

A	neither do I in French it's really hard she's like hah like the lady outside was like erm
B	is that the lady with the short hair?

B	yeah
A	and then did she reply after that?
B	I don't know I haven't check my emails

B	yeah well like between last Wednesday and today?
A	I have practised but not my scales cos scales are boring
B	yeah
A	and I don't practise them I just wing it like he goes right okay so you really the scales need to be your the main focus of your practise this week and I go okay and then just play loads of pieces that he doesn't even want me to play like this one piece I could never play and we gave up on it cos he was like no you can't play this in your grade you're not good enough and I still play it I keep playing it and I'm just like yeah you know
B	but not your piece that you're supposed to play on your own?
A	no I mean I've played all of that and but then he goes one like literally I played my the really long piece probably the worst I've ever played it like I used to be able to play it really well last week
B	oh that's the same with mine my like the more you practise
A	as I practise I get worse yeah
B	the worse you get and it just sounds really sloppy and like
A	yeah and cos I had a tough reed on I had to take a breath like every bar and probably the worst I've ever played it in my life and then he goes yeah that was really good and I was like
B	really?
A	really? so I'd rather he'd be more honest with me and be like look yeah
B	it probably was really good
A	no but it wasn't like I literally had to take a breath every bar and I had to restart it like three times
B	well it's a good job you don't have
A	yeah
B	and then she shouted at me for not taking breaths and then I took a breath and she was like you have to stop taking breaths there
B	you've just told me I had to
A	what's the time?
