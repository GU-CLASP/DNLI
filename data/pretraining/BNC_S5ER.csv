B	well did you hear that story about the erm someone that erm there was lots of jewellery
A	yeah
B	that were erm
A	yeah
B	and the police found it confiscated it from obviously the thing and it disappeared the whole lot
A	really?
B	yeah and they're still not they've no idea where it went at the police station

A	yeah
unknown_female	I wouldn't eat it
B	what?
unknown_female	I wouldn't eat it
B	oh what that?
A	oh manure?
B	no he's just cleared out the guttering
A	oh
B	we swept the stuff off the roof cos it falls on you know it's erm like moss that grows on the roof
A	mm
A	ah
B	scrubbed the patio and
A	yeah
B	get rid of the rubbish so it doesn't wouldn't go down the drain otherwise it would
A	erm I just phoned er the school's er school admissions
B	school admissions yeah
A	yeah
B	in
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	checking out the feasibility of maybe
B	mm
A	erm I haven't spoken to
B	no
A	er because I I thought I'll need to get a bit of information behind me before I do it
B	yeah
A	erm
B	of course
A	so
B	what did they say?
A	well when I
B	yeah is such and such
A	er was sort of January
B	January mm
A	and March at the latest
B	you
A	well I I always have trouble with an Indian accent I find it very difficult to understand them but anyway erm
B	I told you you don't believe me
A	well
B	they they have to by law keep a certain number of places available now it might not be your school of choice
A	well
B	but there's
A	there's erm there's two two aspects of this one is er which would I be applying for primary or junior?
B	how old is she? eight?
A	she's eight she's gonna be nine in October
B	I think that makes her into
A	but
B	nine in October?
A	you you can yeah you can apply for both said it's er it might be a bit harder for junior cos all the places have gone but you might get in on on late admissions
B	mm
A	but also it
B	that's the
A	mm
B	they had to do it by a set you know they had to get choose where they wanted to live they selected the school chose where they wanted to live and searched in that area
A	well they said that they said
A	yeah but I can't they they said that I need proof of er
B	accommodation
A	accommodation right
B	yeah you will
A	so I can't
B	apply
A	I can't do it that way I can only apply giving the only address the the that I've got which is here now
B	mm mm
A	yeah?
B	uhu
A	so
B	which would mean you'd know then move to need to move and if you got her into school you'd need to move to that area yeah?
A	right and then erm I mean how would that fit in with the housing er getting housing
B	well you just have to look for a flat
A	would would I
B	well you then have to look for a flat they if you put our address down then you'd have to look for a flat in this area so that you were in the catchment area from the school
A	mm
B	but I mean
A	that would be difficult wouldn't it?
B	well there aren't many flats in this area
A	mm
B	well there are that's not strictly true there's loads of them there's all down where
A	mm
B	you know there are available erm you just have to look online
A	mm
B	which is where
A	mm
B	erm near ASDA now I don't know where the nearest you know flats would be in that area what you'd have to do would be to go to local estate agents such as erm
A	yep with I I'm told that it's very difficult to to get accommodation if you're on benefits
B	it is it is difficult it is erm more difficult because you know
A	what what if I get erm erm a guarantor as it were
B	it wouldn't matter whether you've got a guarantor or not the the big the thing well I suppose it may do but that isn't your
A	no well I erm I've seen a house
B	you're a private erm individual
A	mm
B	and so there'd be no problem you know they wanna know where you live erm what you know how much you've got in your bank and what you do for a living well you're retired so you know
A	well I could presumably do do one step at a time
B	you'd have to and then you'd have to become a DHSS one
A	mm
B	when your
A	so
B	you'd have to pay it
A	well that
B	yeah it would and then you'll become a DHSS
A	yes
B	but you could sell in the future
A	mm
B	which would be a lot less than if you've got two people or three people
A	mm
B	obviously because that's how it's worked you know you only need to look after yourself kind of thing but if it as you person as you are at the current
A	yeah
B	or you would have to have a large one bedroom where you could sort of use the front room with a put you up or something
A	mm mm
B	that would work erm as long as that large enough to store all your things and
A	mm
B	erm so that that would be one option and then if
A	mm
B	scenarios and and you get families that are homeless they put them in B and B
A	mm
A	how much would that cost
B	well they're you know how how I've no no idea they you know I couldn't give you a price cos they're all different prices I know a two bedroom is around about nine hundred to a thousand
A	right
B	pounds a month
A	would it would it not be better rather than registering saying my
B	why?
A	no?
B	there's no schools around where
A	mm are there not? I don't know
B	no no
A	oh
B	no it would need to well the best thing to do is get on the internet and look at the schools in the area and you'll see I think there is
A	well that's that's what
B	yeah but
A	yeah
B	so if you put
A	oh right okay
B	erm
A	yeah well that's not good and all so he doesn't want because he
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	so erm
A	mm
B	now I know quite a few it's not the most popular because it's right on the edge of a
A	mm
B	so it's probably the least popular of those three
A	yeah okay
B	yeah see what the school the okay
B	do you want some toast?
A	no I'm fine thanks
B	are you sure?
A	yeah yeah
B	age wise I'm sure she'd be in the junior
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	nine she's going to be nine end of October
B	nine
A	I think what about er erm language ability because she
B	well
A	she's obviously not
B	no
A	fluent in in English where well yeah the kids adapt really quickly I know that but er
B	they they might prove
A	yeah yeah
B	so they all
A	yeah
B	oh phone
A	yeah
B	yeah are there any schools in the
unknown_female	well I'm sure there are
B	where?
A	yeah I always see lots of
B	there's
unknown_female	there's erm er what's it?
A	ah
B	oh no there is one
unknown_female	well there is one
B	I don't know what age
unknown_female	I'm trying to think now trying to go through the schools
B	I don't know
B	oh
unknown_female	sorry?
B	gotta take the car
unknown_female	oh if you've got one I'll come and
B	well just come up for I'd forgotten about it it's in my laptop
unknown_female	it's what you should be planning around the day
B	half one
unknown_female	I'm going out to get the car back so
B	where are you going?
unknown_female	I've gotta go and buy erm
B	mm okay
unknown_female	from
B	I don't know that
B	right what do we wanna know?
A	so er
B	map of school
unknown_female	hello
B	hello
B	erm name of schools no that's not what I want is it?
B	thank you darling what is that dark?
unknown_female	yes
B	okay
B	they get places so that's you know
A	ah
B	that's what I'm saying it's not
A	yeah
B	so where are we? we're here
A	so what's
B	that there that's all showing senior schools at the moment
A	ah
B	I think
A	yeah
A	I don't think he wants erm his address er
B	no no er
A	cos he'll he'll have to
B	but in which
A	yeah yeah
B	so
B	let's go up here cos this is
A	mm
B	one of
A	well the guy I spoke to he said erm you have to apply online okay
B	yeah
A	so erm
B	right let's see they want proof of a address
unknown_female	is this the only cream cheese we've got?
B	no darling down there look there's quite a bit
A	okay well
B	oh no you can use that anyway
unknown_female	okay
A	I can do that cos I got my bank statement
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	proof of address for your child
B	mm
A	what has it got there? proof of address the different things they accept
B	mm that
unknown_female	can you see it
unknown_female	oh it's
A	come the
A	oh I haven't got that
B	so can't do any of that at the moment
A	haven't got a medical card
B	that that's what I'm saying it it you have to get the place to live erm
A	get a place to live before
B	yeah
A	but I can't I can't apply until I've got a place to live
B	well that's what I'm saying you'd have to say you're staying here
A	mm
B	and then when you co move you have to move to the area cos the school would be in there
A	but what do I mean what
B	no no exactly
A	but if I said she
B	what
A	yeah
B	well you don't need to tell
A	mm no but it seems it
B	more than she told you
A	no erm I I erm I need to get an address
B	mm mm
A	but er in if
B	well you've got an address you've got our address
A	because I yeah but I have got any of those documents
B	no you haven't but if you're staying with family you don't need a
A	oh
B	a a thingabob
A	okay
B	so you know
A	ah
B	so
A	no I haven't given
B	yeah
A	on the phone said I well I can get her passport over in China
B	yeah
B	yeah that you'd have to do that before you do the application or anything but would she I mean it's it's all
A	but other I'd have to
B	no that's what I'm saying it's complicated
B	right so that's er
A	mm mm
B	now oh they're not showing the schools very well
A	mm mm
B	and then
A	mm
B	that's strange cos they were there just now let's see if I can go back
A	I don't know it seems very unlikely trying to juggle everything
B	no that's that oh they had a
A	but that's all in Chinese isn't it?
B	ah
A	and it's on a family book
B	right
A	mm
B	right so
A	right
B	I think that's called
A	well seeing seeing as I've got nothing no documents for it
B	no
A	for her at all
B	no
A	I haven't even got photos
B	to be honest you won't get her in for September because there's too much to do
A	ah
B	you would have to look at doing it after September you know cos you go over there in June
B	and try and er you know get agreement from
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	so then you'd be back I don't know when you'd be back but when you come back when does your your erm thing erm
A	visa expire?
B	mm
A	September
B	no no not your visa your erm
A	mid September
B	right
A	but I I mean I I intend to apply for a resident's permit actually
B	yeah yeah
A	well if I got yeah resident's permit I don't need a visa
B	right okay
A	oh
B	six months so it's when was it?
A	so that was just before
B	so January February March April May June
A	yeah
B	that's so then mind you if you're bringing
A	mm
B	you would only be on standby so you couldn't be on a standby
A	no
B	and not get on and she got on
A	yeah
B	so that you wouldn't wanna be doing that
A	so to to get this concessions I'll have to go back before the ninth of June
B	yeah to be for you to yeah back there and be back here or whatever it be on concessions you've got to be back by the ninth of June to still be on
A	and be back here oh
B	otherwise your flight back will get you won't get your flight back
A	well
B	I know
A	yeah and I've got to apply for a passport and
B	ah
A	I'm not going won't be able to do it
B	well firstly it depends when you go you know if you went earlier
A	well yeah but she don't want me to to do that do you know
A	well where am I gonna stay?
B	mm that's the the problem
A	well I'll have to stay initially there but then got to up to
B	to be honest if she came over here she would have her operation done free
A	yeah but
B	how urgent is that?
A	yeah well I don't know and also have to
B	what the operation?
A	yeah
B	it wouldn't be necessarily be another year you know it just depends what what the problem was some surgery
A	yeah
B	some surgery is quick some surgery is not
A	but if I was gonna bring her over for next year
B	I don't mean for next year if you didn't make September but came by Christmas or something
A	mm
B	I know it's I know it's a lot and it seems seems a lot but you'd have to do it step-by-step the most complicated part to me is the Chinese bit cos they don't understand that any of that I understand what happens here what you need to do here and it you know most of it can happen quite quickly here
A	mm
B	once you've got that
A	mm
B	erm and presumably
A	mm
B	to do that
A	mm
B	cos I understand what'll happen it you know it's it's quite difficult to coordinate it so the time is difficult but you'd be just say you'd apply for a school say with this as your residence and
A	but it's no in that case
B	well I I I don't know whether it is I don't know how long it would take to organise the Chinese end but for me that's the bit it seems insurmountable to me
A	mm
B	visualise how that would work out if that all works out then and you bring
A	can you get emergency schooling and what would happen?
B	well you wouldn't him you might not get in in the first week or two she'd probably
A	no but I mean would it would it be a problem missing the school entry date in September?
B	it would no why
A	no okay
A	yeah yeah sure
B	so and to be honest it it could be
A	mm
B	right so she'll have missed that last year Sept last September they they all went up year six
A	mm
B	erm and erm
A	mm
B	like everyone's gonna be new in September
A	mm
B	they'll be already in their classrooms by by then by the time she's nearly nine erm
A	mm
B	and quite quite difficult for for her but at the same time hopefully it'll be quite interesting and
B	and erm
B	and and you know I
A	mm well I've got a
B	that's right cos so what what
A	yeah
B	you know
A	well it's not it's been pretty
B	so he's not able to support her?
A	I've got no idea
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	very important to her
A	yeah
B	and she's I think when she stops sinking er stops to think and think well actually do you know what this isn't such a really good arrangement
A	mm
B	not not having the school any more and and having to work to support herself really that's what she's saying
A	mm
B	and that's if he goes you know so right now it might be a
A	mm mm
B	and that's why I say to I think you should write an email to her saying I'm really pleased that you think you've found someone you want to be with and that's that's really great erm I hope he's able to support you erm as you've always you know the way you've been used to
A	mm
B	and that erm and you know I'd like to think he could pay for erm
A	mm
B	if he's not able to look after you
A	no to put all that in an email her English isn't all that good I don't know if she'd understand all that
B	isn't it?
A	well speaking's better than reading
B	right mm
A	mm
B	explain it
A	mm
B	but that's what I my thing would be is like question what she's doing make her question what she's doing and check whether she is absolutely certain about it
unknown_female	I turned it off
B	that would be my first reaction
A	mm
B	and then you can say if that is the case and you feel you erm what there is a future for you with this chap
B	and opportunities that she hasn't might not have in
A	mm
B	I don't know what it's like there but you you know I'm just going by what you say it's a country place is it?
A	mm yeah
B	yeah
B	I I I can't imagine
A	mm
B	she likes nice clothes will she live in a place like that?
A	well there's
B	is there? close by?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	erm it's I'm
B	I
A	mm
B	and suddenly you're not
A	mm
B	and now she's thinking hang on
A	no I don't think erm
A	I don't we haven't even talked about that other than it's I don't think er
B	what's what's always see I don't know her but I'm just trying to think what her motives are what sort of person she is
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	oh god yeah like the wind
B	well there you go so this this idea might just be a
B	sort of a a threat to you at the moment
A	yeah
B	that might be her saying oh you know I
unknown_female	yep
B	well tell her safe journey
unknown_female	yes I will
A	pardon?
B	I said and
unknown_female	yep
B	not back till Saturday
unknown_female	did work it well
B	and that's what you say she can have free school erm and I'll get
A	mm
B	and free free medical
A	mm
B	the future here everyone want you know all private schools like
A	mm
B	cos it's the language that is gonna be needed in the future so I don't know that's how I would play it with
A	yeah okay
unknown_female	right I shall return
B	okay see you in a while darling
unknown_female	in a short while
A	okay
B	drive carefully
unknown_female	yeah
B	well that's how I'd do it I'd send her an email question it making her question her you know what's going on or think about the future rather than oh what what can I do to get out of this situation? think about where what the reality is she's committing she's committing herself to
A	well I don't wanna say that cos
B	mm
A	er because that way erm I I'll be with her and I can look after her and I can get her into school and erm
B	mm
A	who rent properties so now I'm gonna have to change that
B	mm
A	well well say that
A	I can if I if I've got a child
B	mm
A	if I've got a child then I can
B	because she'll think you only want
A	yeah yeah that's true
B	you say the situation is that I've not just found that I am eligible and I can rent a place
A	mm
B	erm I've now found that I you know some contacts to help me find accommodation
A	mm
B	it's you know I I won't bother with the expense if if I if
A	mm
B	why did you say to her you couldn't get a place then without cos you
A	well she's cos she's pushing me about in
B	oh right
A	but er to find somewhere to live
B	but why was she
A	oh I don't know
B	you say well you should have said well I
A	well yeah well
B	he's good company
A	well yeah and
B	you know why should she care where you live?
A	mm
B	so you you know
B	and send her pictures from the internet
A	and she's gonna ask me about how much money I've got
B	well say erm going down fast
A	mm
B	but I get
A	but that's gonna be another bone of contention erm money in the future
B	well her
A	cos I I won't be able to get myself my hands on my property cos it's
B	well you're never going to go back
A	no
B	and you
A	no
B	whatever happens you're never going to get that from her
A	no
B	cos you know
A	mm yeah
B	so
A	that that yeah
B	that I can rent
A	but there won't until under no
B	yeah there's no point unless I think
B	so
A	I think it's better to to put this in an email rather than
B	I do because she would take stop and come back to it and backwards and forwards
A	mm
B	if you say it over the phone it's kind of the heat of the moment
A	mm
B	you can't remember everything that's said
A	mm
B	but if by in an email people go back to it and read it again and it will be a a reminder to her that they're you know right now it seemed like a good idea to her but what is the reality? and she may not wanna tell you if he's got a family or not
A	mm
B	what his financial situation but if you ask her she doesn't have to answer but she'll be thinking well it's really bad I can't tell him or it's really good I'll tell him
A	mm
B	not the fine detail erm and you've you've only remembered the bit that you try to bat off
A	mm
B	so I'd if I was you I'd
A	draft
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm so end that bit then say I'm happy that you are you know gonna have someone that you're happy with erm I hope he's you know a nice person who'll look after you and
A	well that's cos the money for the school
B	I know why
A	mm
B	I know cos he can't afford to pay for the school
A	mm
B	but
A	she'll expect me to I'm surprised she hadn't asked me already
B	well she probably is but you just say like tough innit? you you find someone else
A	mm
B	is he gonna look after you? is he gonna look after
A	well I don't want him to I wanna
B	I know but you you that's she she doesn't you don't want her to know that do you? cos you'll go well you're not having
A	I'd like to
B	well personally
A	if he's not gonna pay for it then I the I will take her
B	I I think it isn't actually
A	mm
B	so it's not about that what you've got to say is kind of like erm make it clear that you're gonna get your life together here you're gonna rent a flat no matter what and if he wants to look after you two but he obviously can't so you point that out in a subtle way
A	yeah
B	erm and she start going oh hang on a minute
A	but then she might question well why do I want to apply for a resident's permit in China
B	so that you can go backwards and forwards
A	yeah
B	to see her
A	yeah
B	well you you can go regularly to see her
A	yeah
B	and because she told you to
B	you're right I'm doing what you said now your
A	mm
B	she doesn't care what you want
A	no
B	she cares what hopefully cares with what

A	yeah I'm gonna have to put all this in very basic terms because
B	no but I'm asking you what sort of job would she do?
A	I I've got no idea
B	what she's capable of doing what
B	so you know is it is it good pay over there? or
A	mm

A	well
B	understand
A	yeah

A	mm
B	and who knows? we'll see won't we?
A	yeah

B	but if you sound as though you're worried about that she'll think that she's got a chance that you'll cough up and stop her that from happening
A	mm
B	but if you say well you know perhaps it is best you know it's the only way you'll be able to do it kind of thing
A	mm
B	will you you know
B	but you first of all need to make clear that you erm
A	but I won't do it unless I
