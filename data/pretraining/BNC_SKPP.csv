A	oh for fuck's sake
B	retard
B	they've got erm thirty thousand followers
A	right
B	and
A	and they're following you?
B	and they follow six thousand people and they started following me and I was like right
A	I'm a
B	no no
B	cos I know like I've learnt with pages like that what they do is they follow people and then obviously when it's like follow for follow
A	yeah
B	it's like if someone follows me I'll look through their stuff if they're interesting like yeah I'll follow you back if they're not interesting I'm like oh fuck you but erm cos they were interesting and like I really liked the outfits that they put up and like it was quite trendy
A	mm
B	erm I was like yeah I'll follow you back but then I thought
A	then they unfollowed you
B	that's no no well they didn't but usually that is what happens
A	right
B	like some girl from
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so is that what they do then? they follow you so you follow them back and then they unfollow you?
B	not not all the time some people do but like
A	that's really sad
B	because I don't really care it's like
A	right
B	and I've made my profile erm public because there's nothing on there that I don't like but I made it public public sorry back when me and
A	yeah
B	so I was in my bio was gonna put my Youtube link I was gonna make it public so that more people would see it
A	mm
B	cos it sounds really sad but what I'm genuinely scared of happening is me putting videos up on Youtube and like and practically no one seeing them or liking them and them just being like a flop
A	mm
B	know what I mean? so like I made it public
A	mm
B	it's like one of my hobbies and I just enjoy it
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't like I don't like stuffing up on my news feed for no reason
A	mm
B	I like enjoying the pictures whereas when they're public and I can look through their pictures and I can see if I get a sense if I like following them
A	mm
B	or if I like the pictures that they're gonna pin up
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	so I started doing the same cos there's
A	yeah
B	yeah like
A	cos she's makeup and stuff innit?
B	that is from her Youtube videos
A	mm
B	like a lot of like sometimes I read the comments on pictures I can see a picture of her that's really beautiful and you comment and I read the other ones and it's people who are like oh you're so beautiful your videos inspire me blah blah blah and she's always so lovely back to them thing is she gets gift packages from her followers
A	really?
B	on Youtube yeah cos she does makeup and stuff like a fashion blog she's
A	mm
B	and it is so cute like when I was at hers the last time and she explained to me and she was like yeah I got this from a follower and it's like that's my favourite lipstick and she's sent it to me and stuff like the
A	how do they know her address?
B	probably look her up and find it
A	that's creepy
B	it's it's
A	it's sweet and it's really nice like I would love that
B	it's
A	if like having people
B	yeah
A	it's creepy
B	but it is really sweet and like all the people that she talks to on Instagram like the people who she replies comments to are like oh thank you love you're so sweet and she's met loads of other bloggers
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah
B	because she's got that style about her to be a blogger and to be like being famous on internet isn't big but there's a girl that a follow called Christian Bazan
A	mm
B	and she
A	mm
B	and she travels the world she goes to different countries and she wears their like like their culture and she like she wears different outfits and like she's gotten famous and is paid for that and
A	really?
B	cos when you get to I think it's three thousand or three thousand five hundred or something around that mark when you get to that many subscribers Youtube pays you to make videos because they get people in to like pay for advert time
A	adverts yeah and that's when your videos start getting adverts on
B	exactly so she's almost hit that point where her videos she's gonna be paid to do them
A	really?
B	and when when she came to
A	promote our product
B	promote our product so just basically use our product and promote it and tell
A	mm
B	there's a girl that I follow on Instagram I didn't know she did Youtube videos
A	yeah
B	she does like a home haul and there's like all her favourite products all her favourite things in her house like she just does random things but so many people love her and they watch her and they're like when it's her birthday or whatever like so many people wish her happy birthday
A	yeah
B	and like it's just it's just really lovely like it brings people together
A	mm
B	like I really really love that and that's why I wanted to start doing videos but for my music cos like I've wanted to do that for a while I've been too shy
A	why though? cos er you're on the internet it's not
B	mm
A	you don't even have to put your face on it you can just like
B	I know it's
A	blur that part out sort of thing like
B	I know
A	you don't even need to you know
B	it's like I want to cos like
A	no I no I understand
B	cos what should I care? but it's still it's it's putting my face in the
A	you yeah it's a
B	yeah
A	a a simple example what last time I went round
B	mm
A	and er we went out and we went to this bar the
B	scared of rejection
A	why the fuck are we here then?
B	mm
A	like why aren't you speaking to them? it was like oh well
B	and that's like me yeah
A	well how do you know until you speak to them? like I don't get it I don't get that but that's because I've always been confident in myself that if I go and speak to a guy I can get laid but
A	I suppose I'm a girl guys will
B	yeah
A	sleep with anything it's harder for guys girls have higher standards
B	yeah and like erm when you er when
A	you should do it
B	no
A	a good singer
B	think
A	like and you
B	I'm not
A	no like
B	saying it for that
A	I'm
A	like the stuff like that and you're such a beautiful singer and you've got such a beautiful face and a beautiful personality like people will love you people will be people are drawn to you and that is a reason like that
B	mm
A	no I'm not saying it for any
B	no I know but I
A	anything but I'm really
B	get really
A	genuinely mean it no but
A	I know you do I do but honestly you are genuinely a beautiful person and it makes me happy in a way that you are you shy away from it cos that tells me that that makes you even more of a beautiful person if that makes sense like
B	mm
A	if you were the sort of person that were to turn around and say oh
A	I love myself that'd make you so much that'd
B	that's not attractive
A	make you a dickhead it's not attractive but the fact that you don't know it and the fact that you're so insecure receiving compliments makes it more clear that you are a beautiful person
B	oh thank you
A	like so anyway let's just forget I said that because I don't want you to feel awkward
A	but like that's what I think about you
B	yeah
A	like I genuinely believe that you are a beautiful person and sometimes I wonder why you're my friend and
B	why?
A	I genuinely think that cos
B	well you know what
A	insecurities
B	I see a lot of myself in you
A	mm
B	I think that's what drew me to you at first is because I'd love to be outgoing and I'm really outgoing with the people that know me
A	mm
B	if you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	and all of that lot
B	because they were like oh we love you so much you have to live with us and I was like well thank you but I'm previously engaged
B	I said that because I knew I was gonna live with you
A	yeah
B	and because you didn't know then yet wasn't gonna be like okay but
A	mm
B	so I just like yeah thanks I'm previously engaged
B	but erm that was the first night I went out with them but
A	mm
B	like I almost went to
A	yeah
B	but she went on the
A	yeah
B	turns out
A	yeah it's such a small world innit?
B	it's just so weird and I was looking at all these pictures like I used to go to school with all of these girls like they like
B	l actually broached the awkwardness and I was like
A	like me with
B	I was like I'm sorry that I'm so awkward but I'm quite shy in these situations and she was like oh my god me too and as soon as we broached that subject
A	you bonded over the yeah
B	we we bonded over our mutual awkwardness
B	and then the whole night it was amazing because I didn't know
A	mm
B	and we went to
B	which is so weird I know
A	me too
B	but we went into there and I remember
B	it was hilarious er that's the only night that I genuinely kind of bonded with
A	the thing is with
B	but not in a nasty way
A	no just that
B	it's just cos we're not very close
A	the thing is with
B	yeah
A	because she has so many cos
B	I guess kinda like me
A	yeah and she's so outgoing and loud and not in a bad way loud but she's just loud and she's nice and
B	mm
A	we really bonded and stuff and I found out a lot about
B	yeah
A	like she really likes you like
B	really?
A	we talked about you like even
B	yeah
A	but like it's so weird like how I met
B	no no it's I'm just
A	erm so I met
B	oh it's because I went to erm I left that day remember I left down to London that day?
A	yeah
B	and you guys went out
A	and erm like we were all wearing colours from our block and all this and it was just such a good night and like that's the first time I've met
B	I was like don't take this the wrong way well there's nothing to take the wrong way but I was so so happy when you told me that you'd were getting closer to
A	yeah
B	so cos it's like I know I'm the same it's like I made you as a friend and
A	mm
B	in smaller numbers and when you started branching out I was like I was so happy for you I was like I'm so happy that you've gotten over that insecurity because of everything that happened with our flatmates
A	yeah
B	and that you'd made other friends and I was like that's gonna force me to make other friends when I get back then
A	yeah
B	I was so happy for you like literally I was oh new people
B	going to get to like do all this stuff with
A	yeah you just it was so shit though cos you couldn't be there
B	I know
A	mm
B	and then when I was about to come home I sent it back saying
A	yeah you did on our Facebook walls yeah
B	I can't wait to see you guys yeah
A	but like
B	I find that so strange cos I've never been close to any of them
A	no but they they consider you a friend
B	it's lovely though
A	but like next year cos like obviously I say to
B	you guys have proper bonded
A	yeah and like she and black
B	ah
A	all this lot and that and like all of them really like both of us
B	that's so so sweet
A	like
B	it makes me feel really good because I've always gotten on really well with black
A	mm
B	like from that first night we bonded because when I said
A	and she'll getting her arse out and stuff
B	yeah like from that first night when we bonded over
B	and then the fact that we were both dancing to R and B but then when that Drake song came on I just I lost it and I I've told you about that when I started rapping it
A	yeah
B	and then I always have my eyes closed like that and I opened my eyes and there was like a little circle like around us
B	and it was just me and I was like
B	cos people obviously were like wow and like black
B	I didn't know you were like that and
B	I'm sorry
B	mm
A	I mean I don't see it's weird cos like I really close relationship with
B	mm
A	I find it hard I do like
B	mm
A	because she's
B	mm
A	I just find it hard to not feel awkward around her
B	whereas mine's different I've got so close to
A	yeah and you feel awkward around the rest it's it's the same
B	especially as awful as this sounds cos I know that white
A	mm
B	like in a nice way not being bitchy
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	like I've never gotten
A	I don't get it either
B	and I've never gotten a
A	no me neither
B	and it's like I'm gonna give her time because obviously she's friends with my friends and like she seems like a really lovely person but when I went out with I can't remember why you couldn't come but the night out the night I went out with
A	out at the
B	yeah the night I went out with
A	well I've got a funny story for you before you finish that
B	yeah
B	maybe
A	a nice vibe from her either
B	because the first time I met white
A	yeah
B	she was with her ex boyfriend and erm we went to
A	yeah
B	they'd already left uni but they were coming back
A	yeah
B	so I went with them and it was a really really fun night like we sat in
A	yeah
B	as soon as she's drunk and I'm drunk and I'm smoking she's like can I have a bit? and I'm like yeah go on smoke it like
B	and I'm the one that taught her
B	and I feel
A	yeah but she doesn't smoke normally
B	no no
A	it's only when she's drinking so it's fine
B	even though she still doesn't smoke like she says she hates it
A	go on I'll have a drag
B	I still feel bad but anyway
B	we were at like a separate table
B	white
A	yeah
B	and everything like when
A	yeah
B	I was chatting to
A	yeah cos I was still getting ready yeah
B	and you came down and I was like I'm gonna go down and meet you and erm we started off and it was alright and we were playing like it was the night that
A	mm
B	came up so I was really like I'm gonna feel fine because there's
A	go on
B	so I was er already feeling a little bit awkward because
A	mm
B	cos as soon as you're around it's like I find it very hard to instigate conversation
A	yeah
B	whereas when you're there and you start up a conversation I find it easy to slide in
A	yeah
B	but I need someone to make the first move so
B	yeah
A	white
B	yeah but because I knew he was I knew that he was her boyfriend so like
A	interested
B	trying to go anywhere
A	yeah
B	but it's it it turned out fine and then cos
A	yeah from your course yeah
B	yeah erm Asian Asian
A	yeah
B	and we started erm
B	cos we were all in in first semester for er a
A	let's go inside it's cold
B	we were bring the wine
A	yeah I'm bringing it don't worry
B	we were all in the same seminar which I don't know if I've ever told you actually
B	and that's how we became friends but before that I was friends with erm
A	the Asian guy?
B	yeah so it was me and
B	which is completely coincidental because then we got put into groups and our group because we were all sitting together talking our group was me
A	right
B	who I still don't like
B	we only met up we were supposed to meet up every week before our seminar to discuss the questions
B	so we decided let's just not do this again we'll just wing it the next time
A	yeah
B	cos no one wanted to meet up that early in the morning cos our seminar was already at ten and we had to meet up and nine and no one wanted to do that
A	yeah no one wants to do that
B	so we met up once
A	mm
B	and sit and like we would chat and stuff and then
A	ah
B	and I was like oh but
B	I was like you were so sweet and I loved you so much
B	so we just became friends that's why that night at
A	that's the first time you disappeared as well
B	I'm sorry
A	no I disappear all the time
B	I had such a good
A	I disappear all the time like how many times do I disappear?
B	yeah
A	over the course of the year just the
B	Halloween was the worst
A	yeah cos it were my birthday as well weren't it?
B	oh god I literally
A	I didn't right
B	I was feeling horrible I was looking for you everywhere we were sending people off in groups to look for you
B	and then when you sent me that message saying you're being such a dick and all that kind of stuff I literally cried in the middle of the of the club
A	I'm so sorry
B	and I was like she just called me a dick and I was like
B	she's completely right and everyone was like no she was the one that left we tried looking for her we couldn't find her
A	no
B	that was her decision I was like yeah but I should have been with her I should
A	yeah
B	have been looking after her
B	and everyone was like shut up cos they were annoyed at me because I was getting up upset and I was like
B	and all this
A	no to be fair I think it were like
B	we were walking out of the smokers' corner
A	yeah we and we walked
B	and there was a door to get in
A	up instead of down didn't we?
B	and there was a walk to go up so we went up
A	but the
B	you blagged us in but
A	at the time I was hammered
B	then we were up there
A	I didn't remember
B	but when we got up there I remember everything clearly cos I wasn't that drunk
A	I was battered
B	I know
B	erm when we got up there I said to everyone right I need a wee and people were like yeah I wanna come yeah and I wanna come yeah and I wanna come so I went with I think it was
A	you went with everyone I was on my own
A	cos I said I didn't want to come
B	and you said you didn't want a wee
A	I'll wait here
B	so we were like alright wait here and the guys were there as well like wait here we're going to the toilet
A	mm
B	when we came out of the toilet you were gone we asked the guys and like yeah she went off to see someone she said she'd come back
B	we waited upstairs for about half an hour
A	how did I find my way back upstairs though?
B	you didn't
A	I don't understand
B	but you went off to see someone you didn't come back we waited there for half an hour and we were like right we need to start looking for her so we some of us stayed upstairs me and
B	we went downstairs walked all the way round the stage in a massive circle
B	we were by the exit there was a bar by the exit and then the smokers' thing
A	mm
B	and it's like that's where I am then you were like I can't find that and I was like well stay exactly where you are
B	we're coming to find you if you keep moving around we can't find you and that's when you replied saying you're being a dickhead and stuff
B	and I was just like but we've been looking for you for two hours
B	and like short of saying you ruined our night because we were looking for you rather than enjoying it I was like just stay fucking exactly where you are stop moving at the same time we are
B	and then when you said I'm going home and all that kind of stuff I was like
B	but instead of being angry I got upset
A	oh I'm sorry
B	because that time because I was no no I'm not saying this to make you upset it's just I'm telling you my side because
A	mm
B	we were so close I literally I felt so guilty like I couldn't enjoy myself without you being there
A	mm
B	and that's why I felt so bad and like when you told me that I was a dickhead it just sort of confirmed all the guilt that I had inside myself
B	and I was just like
A	such a dickhead
B	I was like oh my god I feel so bad but the next day you were completely fine with me the next day when you
A	like
B	when you woke up and I was like text me when you wake up and stuff and you did and I was like my god she's gonna really shout at me
B	I was literally getting like and my palms were sweating and I was literally I I'm having to get ready for the shouting and
B	and I came over and it was fine and you were like hi how are you? and stuff and I was like
B	and that's when you were like no no I'm sorry it was my fault and you said all this kind of stuff and I was like I have been worried
B	for twenty-four hours
B	about you and it turns out you're fucking fine
B	and I was just like
A	yeah well that's the night that I found that handbag with that phone in
B	yeah
A	I'm such a dick I'm sorry
B	no but from now
B	cos I know you that bit better and I know
A	I go on adventures
B	your personality and I know that you go on adventures and I know that you get a bit more
A	aggressive when I'm drunk
B	wouldn't say yeah aggressive when you're drunk
A	yeah I do yeah
B	I've stopped taking it personal personally
B	cos it's like that night out that we went with
A	no no
B	feel like that the next day so I was like when I sent you home and gave you the keys I knew that you'd be fine
A	yeah
B	but it's like at first because you were
B	and that's why felt such an obligation to like
A	no I felt so bad as well
B	be
A	a lot of the times
B	like that with you but now on like even next year or anything if you go off on an adventure I hope you know
A	you're just gonna leave me
B	er I'm I'm just gonna leave you
B	because I'm not saying this nasty like obviously I'll check that you were okay and like ring you if you stop answering or whatever if you've gone home to sleep I'm just gonna like she's fucking fine
B	because that night was honestly I I was sick with worry
A	oh I'm so sorry
B	no no I was sick with worry because
A	I'm so sorry
B	I knew how drunk you were I was sick with worry because I thought something would have happened to you that's the I mean
A	can you imagine me getting raped? that would never happen
B	no you'd rip off someone's penis before that happened but I just
A	I would bite it off
B	but I just I just I felt sick with worry but now that I know you because that was that was a month after we met each other
A	mm
B	not even or a bit more
A	we were still like even then we were like mega close though weren't we like?
B	yeah but it was still it was still new
A	yeah
B	and I still felt like
A	didn't really know each other
B	it sounds
A	that deeply
B	really sad like I feel I can tell you now but I still felt like I had to impress you
A	yeah I felt
B	so
A	the same about you for up until like January
B	yeah it's like don't
A	even when I
B	don't
A	even though when I were at your house with your parents I felt like I had to impress
B	so
A	everyone
B	don't take this the wrong way because I don't feel like that now
A	mm
B	and honestly it's not a a problem but I felt like I had to agree with you on everything because you were so strong personality wise
A	mm
B	and like your rants and stuff I'm not gonna lie
B	at first fucking terrified me
B	cos I'd never seen anyone apart from my mum use such profuse language and I'd be like yeah I agree
B	fucking fucking dickhead cunt yeah yeah cos I was scared about what you'd like turn on me if I said no don't agree
B	whereas now I'm just like no come no erm but yeah that's why I got so scared that night of Halloween and I told
B	I can't have her being mad at me
A	I'm such a dickhead
B	she's gonna yell at me tomorrow and all that kind of stuff
B	but he was like why do you care so much blah blah blah and I was like she's my only friend
B	but he was like you're out with all these people and I was like yes but I don't like them
A	opinions yeah
B	and it sounds really stupid but now I know that I can I can say no and like you don't care
A	mm
B	like at first I felt like I was
A	I accept it
B	like I I have to agree with her because otherwise we won't be friends
B	and I can't lose her as a friend
A	I used to think the same about you it's really weird cos like
B	oh really?
A	yeah cos like
B	mm
A	you
B	listen
A	okay
B	all the nights I've been like don't take offence don't take offence
B	right
A	I would not have thought twice about it I would have before I met you I would have done that to
B	mm
A	if in September I didn't meet you and we weren't friends and all that happened I would have done that I would not have thought twice about it and I felt guilty after I did it and my conscience would not let me rest like I wouldn't have been able to sleep blah blah but wouldn't have thought any twice about doing it but as soon as I met you and as soon as we got to know each other and as soon as we became really good friends I always found myself thinking what would
B	really?
B	but that
A	and like
B	I don't take offence by that I actually find that's quite a complement because I know that I have a very high tolerance and I know that I will always give people the benefit of the doubt or I'm always one for giving second chances and all that kind of stuff I mean
A	mm
B	like I just I don't
A	hold grudges
B	no I
A	you're not a bitter person
B	I I can't like I physically can't
A	it takes too much energy
B	yeah
A	like
B	I just don't have time for it
A	and
B	and I've I've always told you that as well it's like when you would always go off on a rant or stuff like with
A	mm
B	it's like I just don't care I nothing them
A	mm
B	and I find that quite a compliment that you say that because
A	no
B	I'd never met anyone who was so like expressive
A	mm
B	with their feelings I guess
A	but it helps me because
B	so because I was also quite young I mean I was only eighteen like I'm nineteen now it's not a big difference but because I'd never
A	yeah
B	you'd lived through you opened my eyes as well just the way I guess you opened mine
A	in the opposite way yeah like
B	but I find that as a compliment rather than offensive because it feels nice to be able to know that I'm able to
A	made a positive impact
B	calm you in a certain way
A	yeah cos
B	just the way that you bring out the fire in me
A	cos the thing is like with me like before I went to university I went to see a psychic you know the story I've
B	mm
A	told you
B	yeah
A	didn't I didn't speak to her for four years I used to tell her how much I hated her
B	do you wanna go over this thing?
A	yeah like
B	again
A	I used to tell her how much I hated her like I never used to get a birthday card off her I didn't get a birthday card off her from being fifteen
B	that's really sad though that's really
A	like
B	it's alight
A	and I went I went to see this psychic and she told me all this stuff like I were carrying on this taking this around with me and had all these problems and
B	yeah
A	it was weird I don't know why
B	alight
A	like and she were telling me like I were carrying this bitterness around with me and I was such an angry person and like I thought right I reckon if it were mum I'm gonna stop carrying this bitterness around with me and I thought that would be enough and then I met you and like
B	the thing is
A	and
B	you say that you were a really angry person until you met me but I was too calm a person till you met me I was a pushover I'm not afraid of admitting it I still am I'm working at
A	and you still are but
B	I'm working on it
A	the thing is I'm still an angry person but I'm working on it
B	and I think that's what
A	you know?
B	that's what we bring each other we complement each other because I teach you how to calm down and maybe think a bit more rationally or whatever
A	and I teach you how to stand up for yourself a little bit more
B	you teach me how to stand up for myself because I mean there are things that people have done to me that I have let go because I haven't been bothered or I've been too scared of confrontation
A	yeah
B	whereas no having that argument with
A	yeah
B	feels like even though I knew that I like what I've said to you from the start even though I knew that I would never be friends with any of those people regardless of what I said whether I was nice to them or not
A	yeah
B	but I'm working on it
A	but that really upset me as well and I'm so I'm saying this now but it really upset me that they were doing all these things to me and you couldn't stand up for me and then I took a step back and realised that you're not me
B	I know
A	you are not like that
B	but I
A	and you're that that's not a fault
B	no but I've
A	it's a fault of mine that I thought that of you
B	I've always always felt every time something happened and I er I couldn't not that you were insinuating because I know you didn't mean it to put me down but when you'd say or when
A	and you did though
B	that meeting that you had
A	you made a difference by being my friend
B	that's
A	but does it even matter about the meeting?
B	with that guy at university that's I said I was gonna use my voice but like honestly you saying that it's like it's not it's not news to me because I knew every time that you wanted me to stick up for you and I didn't do it it's something that I regret
A	but you stuck up for me in a different way
B	but
A	you stuck up for me by still being my friend
B	well I'm
A	and standing by me by and
B	I'm glad you see it that way because
A	you know
B	even even
A	you didn't stand up with your gob you stood up by being my friend
B	that's
A	and you stood up in a different way
B	I I guess that's just kind of how I use myself it's like I will always show support where it's needed
A	no it's who you are
B	not not only for myself though it's just for you it's for myself I'm not even capable of saying stuff for myself like when I heard
A	no and I understand that and it's like I mean
B	yeah
A	and everything was so perfect like you remember that little white board that we had?
B	yeah
A	like erm so and so in this flat
B	put all our names on it
A	love so and so in four 0 seven and it was so nice and then as soon as
B	not
A	no just not even
B	because I don't know if I told you this but
A	mm
B	got into the lift together and it was it was so awkward I mean I wasn't gonna say anything because well as much as I I don't have the guts to stick up for people that I love and stuff I have the guts to just remain silent so like I like I'm like my mum I'm very much like my mum I like to please people
A	yeah
B	whether I like them or not I like to be liked and that's one of my faults I I I need to be liked
A	mm
B	so that's probably one of the reasons why I always stay silent but when we go into the lift I didn't say anything and I didn't look in her direction and I was like this is awkward but I'm I'm staying silent I was like I don't need to please this person I don't like this person and she started talking to me and she was like hi
A	interested
B	like no worried like genuinely worried
A	mm
B	and I was like things could be better thanks like I was being short and I was
A	civil
B	I was proud of myself in that moment because usually I would be civil as fuck but to this person I just I felt like I owed her nothing
A	yeah we both do it's a habit yeah
B	but she was I could tell she was trying and I just wasn't interested and I was like this is my time to rectify all those times I didn't stick up for you like do you know what I mean? because
A	but I don't need you to stick up for me
B	no I know
A	but like in my head
B	and you're saying you're saying this now
A	in my head it's like
B	but at the time
A	I wanted you to but then
B	no
A	I think to myself I don't need anyone to stick up for me because end of the day I did nothing wrong I did nothing to deserve that the thing is with
B	no but
A	and that's all it were
B	hear me out like this isn't nasty at all you're saying this now but at the time I know you wanted to stick up for me I could see it in your eyes I could sense it in what you were saying even
A	mm
B	and that's when I tried to make a difference but I'm just I'm not that person no matter what someone does to me or as well as awful as it sounds especially to someone else because if someone does something awful to someone else as awful as it sounds they didn't do it to me
A	yeah
B	and I think in my head I have no right to be horrible to this person
A	mm
B	because of what they've done to someone else because no matter how close that person is to me or whatever I if unless they hurt me personally I physically can't muster that strength and that anger
A	yeah
B	to pull them up on it and I love you so much and I hope you know that
A	I know you do
B	I would do anything for you
A	of course I do of course I do
B	I hope you know that I just
A	er
B	I can't
A	I know
B	voice it
A	and I know that and I always knew that and like that's why I always stuck up for you not because of any other reason but I knew that you couldn't do it yourself and that's why I always
B	I can't do it for myself
A	that's why I always put myself out there that's why I always made it known that I was not happy with how
B	no
A	they were treating you
B	I'm sorry because I realise that
A	and I didn't do it for anything else other than I wanted them to stop
B	no because I think you need
A	doing what they were doing to you as well
B	you need to hear this
A	what they were doing to me
B	because half of the stuff that you've lived through with all of those horrible people is because of me because you've been sticking
A	it's not because of you
B	no listen it's because you've been sticking up for me and you'd always put yourself out there for my sake and defend me and I wasn't able to do the same for you and I'm so sorry that you had to live through all of that with the people and I wasn't there to stick up for you
A	do you know what
B	but I would always choose you over anyone else
A	I know you would that is
B	no I
A	but my point is
B	I know
A	you
B	I'm just sorry that I couldn't
A	what?
B	give you more
A	what? be angry at them make yourself a victim
B	yeah but I
A	or a target like me?
B	I didn't care what they thought that's the thing is like
A	I know but that's the thing you showed them that
B	I didn't care and I'm so sorry
A	don't don't seriously
B	no because you lived through so much shit
A	and so did you
B	I just hope you know that
A	the fact is that I stood up to them and they're bullies that's all they were that is all
A	through all this shit that I deserved
B	well of course
A	or didn't deserve you were there as my friend you're still my friend now you know? and you didn't have to be the easy way out would have been do what
B	I wouldn't have done that ever
A	exactly and that's your way of sticking up for me and being my friend
B	I'm sorry that I couldn't voice it is all I'm saying but
A	it doesn't matter
B	through you helping me and showing me that it's okay to stick up for yourself and it's okay to get angry at people it's not the end of the world
A	eh up then ginger
B	so because I had had quite a closed upbringing and was so different to your situation I just want you to know that you have helped me to find the voice that I guess I've always wanted to have but I've been too scared to voice if you know what I mean it sounds really weird but because what I lived through with
A	it is because I'm not being funny or anything but
B	but I think that's the worse I think that's the
A	it's the worst
B	it's the worst feeling I can have because I'd rather someone shout at me and me explain my side or me shout back than silence and I think you and seeing how the way you handle things and learning about your upbringing and just a completely different side to what I've ever lived through has helped me find it and this summer with all the shit that's gone through with
A	and I was I'm proud of you as well
B	and it was fine and as soon as I realised and I saw
A	yeah you worked it out
B	not even an awkwardness because she wanted to hear it and I was ready to say it it made me realise that I've got nothing to be afraid of by standing up for myself and that's because of you
A	do you know?
B	I had to live through this year of being naïve and being the sweet little shy girl or whatever to actually realise that life doesn't work like that you can't be nice to everyone and not everyone's gonna like you and I had to learn that but I learnt it from you because my parents have given me a sheltered upbringing and I have had that all through my life because I've never had to live through it do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	so like what I lived through with
A	yeah
B	and I'm gonna say you've lived because I know it was ten times worse for you than it was for me
A	I know what you mean
B	in the way that you want me to
A	do you know what? I hope you never have to
B	I
A	for my sake
B	I hope I never have to but
A	cos do you know what? like I
B	it's gonna happen all through life and it's gonna happen to me
A	of course it is
B	it's gonna happen to you it's gonna happen to everyone
A	the thing is like the thing that bothered me the most about the whole situation is that they didn't know me they was making all this judgements judgements about me they and from this one status that I put on Facebook that I deleted straight away which should have told them everything they should know I apologised to
B	yeah
A	and I made this effort and I've made this effort from September and blah blah like
B	no
A	anything they don't know me personally they don't know my likes or dislikes
B	but
A	all they know is what they see
B	having said that and all that you've lived through and living through that and
A	mm
B	rather than immediately defending myself what I do is I I mull it over it builds deep inside of me and then one day I snap
A	yeah
B	and I fucking I mean I fucking snap like no one wants to be there when that happens
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah
B	in that sense of things because
A	you just worry
B	he's
A	and it builds up
B	he lets it build up he
A	you're not bulimic
B	no I know I'm not but you know
A	I know what you mean
B	I inverted it on myself
A	I worried about you so much
B	but now I
A	when you told me that
B	feel like I'm I'm not gonna do that to myself anymore because it's not me that's the problem it was them the whole time
A	I'm so glad that you've you've told me what you've told me because like ever since you you opened up to me and told me that I've done nothing but worry about you
B	I'm sorry for doing that to you
A	no mm babe don't be stupid like
B	no there's nothing
A	and then ever since then
B	you can say to anyone
A	I know
B	when they tell you something like that like
A	but
B	I shouldn't have put you in that even though you are
A	no you're my friend
B	no but
A	if anything like that ever happens I want you to tell me like
A	don't no listen to me
B	you are my closest friend
A	don't ever feel like you need to be drunk to tell me shit like that ever
B	okay
A	because it just it I don't care whether you've got warts growing out of your fucking face whatever you problem you've got
B	I know it's just
A	you should come to me and tell me because
B	well
A	I might not be able to help but I can at least support you
B	I was so ashamed at it and the fact that it was happening and I was so ashamed that I'd gone back to that after having it happen before I was so ashamed at myself that I felt like the only way I could genuinely get it out was if I was drunk and I wouldn't have any inhibitions or anything but genuinely you are my closest closest friend and I would tell you anything
A	mm
B	and like I felt awful at the way I sprung it on you when we were both drunk we had no real way of dealing with it and I felt awful at the fact that that's the way it came out and I was like you deserved
A	it
B	more as a as my closest friend than saying that
A	it it doesn't matter how it comes out as long as you tell me that's all I ask like I can't help you if I don't know and like you can't help me I you don't know my shit and it's
B	it's happened exactly three times since I've been home and all of that was in the month of June
A	I'm so glad that
B	so nothing since July or August or
A	I'm so glad that you're okay though
B	a bit of September
A	cos ever since you told me all I've done is worry about it and worry about you and
B	well I feel like since I've been back in my home environment and I've been with
A	of course he is
B	but in different ways so like you are a very very
A	I don't think I'd compare myself to
B	my friends in France like I need you to know that like your opinion of me counts more than anything that
A	it's different it's different completely different
B	but I guess since I've been back with him and it's actually been me with him and it's not a limit the amount of time it's not a week and it's a good three months and it's a good you know of time
A	it's not even the same it's a nice environment
B	I've calmed
A	non stressed environment
B	I've calmed down and I haven't been stressed and I haven't had worries or since I saw my sister and it's been fine
A	peacocks
B	and like we make jokes about it but secretly I'd be dying inside I'd look at all those people and I'm like
A	excuse me hello
B	no I know you say that but people have different visions of their own bodies
A	yeah but
B	no but
A	like my weight
B	no
A	bothers me so much
B	shut up
A	and I can't
B	no
A	no but seriously
B	no
A	I can't even
B	shut up
A	begin to explain how much
B	no
A	how much it bothers me
B	you need to be quiet now
A	but how much do you think it bothers me
B	no I'm
A	going to the gym and seeing that seeing them girls like that?
B	I'm talking now I'm talking now you put yourself down so much but the thing is you always compare yourself to me and I'm not saying that in a nasty way
A	I don't compare myself to you I compare myself to fucking ridiculous things like celebrities and
B	I'm not putting you down by saying that but I know that you do it I see you doing it when I come in wearing an outfit for a night out and you're wearing yours I see you looking at me but the thing is
B	okay your shoulders no matter how much you're like oh my shoulders are too big shut up because you're not
B	they are perfect in comparison to your body and your boobs and your waist goes in so much and you have perfect curves in an arse it's like it's like looking at Iggy Azalea
B	but you have the tits that go with it
A	mm
B	and it's so irritating because
B	I've always wanted boobs
A	tits
B	but a bum as well because I know that I'm petite but I'm a kind of curvy petite
A	well
B	that's really weird because
A	it's not weird
B	most petite people's I I think of petite and I think of
A	you've not got small boobs
B	but it's all in proportion whereas mine I'm average I'm not gonna lie I'm average
A	mm
B	I'm alright but I've got the curves that go with it but not the kind of arse that goes with it
B	like everything's kind of just out of proportion with my body but that's the kind of thing that when you look at me you don't see my insecurities but it's the same with me I look at you and I don't see your insecurities because I don't know what the fuck you bang on about all the time
B	because I literally look at you and I'm just like what the fuck are you talking about now?
A	and I feel the same when you
B	that's what I mean it's like we have to start understanding each other rather than looking at each other and we're like just block it out because I'm not gonna lie sometimes when
A	same
B	I look at you
B	and I'm just like I'm just gonna sing a song in my head cos I'm just gonna look at you and put wiggle wiggle wiggle next to it
B	and just watch you look at yourself and just be like yeah
B	that's fine and then you turn around and look at me and I'm like yeah yeah I agree I'm just like what's she talking about?
B	have I agreed to having a threesome? what have I agreed to?
B	I just I need I'm making a joke out of it but this is dead serious
A	yeah
B	I need you to stop
A	I need you to stop
B	and hearing this from me okay
A	I need you to stop
B	I've gotten over
A	about your shit
B	my problems but I've lived through problems and I need you to stop before you get to where I was
A	do you know what a weird thing is? do you know up until
A	and then this one girl don't even know her name and don't even remember her Bebo name
A	she were on Bebo
B	I used to love Bebo
A	same yeah
B	oh bitch
A	and from that moment on I've been insecure
B	yeah
A	I don't even remember her name like
B	but there's a difference between being confident in yourself and being arrogant and being confident in yourself and being insecure you just have to find that balance
A	mm
B	it's like
A	everyone thinks I'm confident until I'm a friend
B	no
A	and then they realise that I'm not
B	that that's what I thought about you and why I was so
A	thank you
B	but I think one of the reasons is that I've always been pretty confident in myself like I have always just like not cared well I say that apart from a few hiccups along the way I've always just sort of not cared and I've been like this is who I am and no matter how much I diet and no matter how much I do sport my body just never changes
A	fake it until you make it
B	exactly
A	like you fake like
B	the same I would never ever think that about him
A	but how confident does he come across?
B	mm
A	because he fakes it and he's always said to me fake it until you make it
B	that's
A	that is his catchphrase like if you were
B	I've heard that
A	gonna be a TV show presenter that would be him
B	and fucking cheesy
A	no but seriously
B	I can imagine him as a sport commentator
B	on like a news channel it's like remember guys fake it until you make it
B	I can actually see him doing that
A	go like that and winking
B	yeah
A	like Anchorman
B	yeah
A	cos he's not manly enough
B	but no like I know we're all girls and we all live through it and everyone has their own problems and their own insecurities but as much as I'm such a hypocrite saying this because I don't actually believe it in myself but I will always put it out there
B	like to
A	she said that to me as well
B	and I'm not gonna be rude
A	yeah me too
B	but
A	I would never say that to her
B	I will always promote to her be like if you're confident in yourself guys will feel that guys will think it's sexy it only becomes a problem when you show that it's a problem
A	mm and voice it
B	exactly so it's like if you tell people that you are happy with the way that you are if you like you're happy the way you are no one will give a shit like literally no one will even notice
A	we should like go to the
