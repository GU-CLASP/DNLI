B	has she made any money?
A	probably makes like two hundred and fifty quid each time
B	well you know that did you hear why we don't have any internet?
A	why?
B	the electricians cut the the guy said I don't understand he said I've got a dialling tone here and I've got a dialling tone er there and there's five metres between them where there's no dialling tone but then it should be er the only reason it could be there is because it's there and er wire just doesn't disappear
A	yeah
B	what have you had done? and I said well actually I've just had some electricians round and I mean it was after they were here but it stopped working so he made me call them
A	and they they'd cut they snipped it?
B	and they said don't know what you're talking about and he said well I'm gonna have to charge you I said you're not gonna charge me anything I'm not paying anything I already pay through the nose for this service and he said alright well what we'll do and this is just strictly between you and me and he was staring at me like you're definitely gonna right that's definitely between you and me right?
B	erm I'm gonna say that the cable's damaged outside okay? and that way you won't have to pay for it and I said yes thank you so that's why it's coming through a new place
A	right
B	and why we don't have it where it used to be and they had a whole team of people here with a hoist with a you know one of those trucks er where it goes
A	how much would it have cost?
B	fuck knows
B	fuck knows
A	couldn't you get the electricians to pay it? cos you could just say yes you did
B	mm the one thing well I shouldn't have given them a cheque straightaway so the the radiator doesn't work but I'm not paying
A	yeah
B	because if they say to me it's
A	what exactly is wrong with it?
B	leaking it's got got a hairline crack and it leaks and you can't have that
A	so
B	yes we've never even negotiated with them
A	mate that's some money
B	the electricians got eighty quid an hour
A	wow
B	well you can get electricians that are cheaper than that but the guy who er I got before was a complete and utter fucking charlatan and that's why I had to
A	what does that mean? what's a charlatan?
B	oh darling why
A	what?
A	well what's a charlatan?
B	erm a fraud
A	why don't you go to the drink as well?

B	I don't know in
A	have you seen any more mice?
B	I haven't seen any mice
A	I haven't either
B	but er I mean it does smell of peppermint er even I can smell it
A	smell of what?
B	peppermint
B	I mean that's they don't like the smell of peppermint
A	how do you know?
B	erm because I looked it up on the internet and also everyone says that but I'm gonna wash the floor in a sec cos the floor's dirty and the and the toaster was absolutely heaving with crumbs so it and we
A	do you wanna re-employ me? five quid a
B	oh yeah I would like to you catch one and I'll give you a fiver
A	I can't believe they got people to work in a shop for free as interns man
B	no but that's
A	I dunno I would be interested to see how they spun it though
B	how who
B	er I know
A	it's even weird that people would would do that
B	well maybe foreign students
A	why would they do it?
B	well because people don't know if they go back to their country and say they did an internship in
B	well you have to go and work as a barista or something
A	they've probably got interns doing that as well
