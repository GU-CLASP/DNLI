A	oh dear
B	is it that?
A	no I think it's at the I put the recording volume button up by mistake
B	Jake Whites?
A	yeah and we were doing it out in the sun and I got sunburnt and everything
B	it's bit different isn't it? Just a wee bit different
A	then woke up this morning opened the curtains and it was snow
B	it's not just snow is it? It it's freezing it's perishing isn't it
A	I hate it ah
B	yeah well ah it's good that you were thinking that way round rather than I mean she's bad isn't it cos unfortunately this is it this is  this is  the norm
A	yeah no Well I yes unfortunately
B	which bit of the Mediterranean?
A	I was living in Spain in South East Spain
B	oh right
A	and uh yes so I thought oh gosh this winter's going to be a nightmare it's going to be awful and I got to about halfway through December and I started thinking oh I can do this you know I'm quite I'm getting quite good at surviving in these climes so I started bragging about it by going oh I can actually survive British winters oh and then everyone was like no this is not a British winter this is mild
B	mm
A	started feeling a bit oh dear yes how am I going to manage
B	that's where  that's where  two sets of clothes come out
A	exactly
B	erm uh but the actual problem is that the most countries not just this country they never get their weather forecast right so you got out wearing one thing right by the  by the  time you're out you're you end up with a car full of stuff just in case or I do anyway with a daughter and a dog
A	right
B	yeah
A	no I just can't get the whole you know seasons
B	mhm
A	you're used to like you're used to the sun coming up and going down and you're body's used to it and you relay on it in a way but for me seasons usually I don't know follow a pattern but that's the problem here in Britain it's
B	is there a season now? Haven't got any anymore
A	no
B	and that's why the the the flowers the animals everything is just confused
A	ah what are we doing living here?
B	living? I've only worked for the business for two years
A	oh right
B	so em just like if someone said we've got something in Australia em we'd like you to go and look at them
A	aha
B	I'd say yeah I would do
A	and what what were you working in before or was it?
B	in the holiday park industry
A	aha
B	haven? Have you heard of Haven? They're the biggest one in this country
A	yeah
B	which if
A	really?
B	well they're right on the edge of the country
A	aha
B	and they always have this feel that says that they're  that they're
A	mm
B	they've all got stories to tell
A	really what are they like ex-convicts and?
B	no they've just got issues
A	right
B	they've just got issues
A	bizarre
B	and the but the only trouble with the the holiday park industry is that em whereas we're right next to a motorway and the
A	mm
B	it'd take three hours to get from one to the other just just because it was holiday season you'd be stuck behind a tractor or stuck behind a caravan somewhere and uh just a nightmare getting anywhere
A	mm
B	Don't get me wrong lovely industry to be in because I used to stay in the lodges
A	aha oh nice
B	and um and then I'd eh get up go down for a run down the beach before I'd end up going to work
A	lovely
B	I was living in
A	okay
B	but em the I suppose the nice thing about the holiday park industry is it's a bit like this
A	yep
B	no no some people there's some people decide I've paid for these two weeks if it isn't absolutely bang on then I'm gonna get really upset but generally speaking people are quite chilled so it's it's a nice industry to be in because of that as well
A	mm
B	yeah well em I left Park Resorts I'm actually finding this quite difficult because em I'm I'm I'm quite used to opening uh asking lots of open questions
A	oh right oh
B	and getting people to feed things back to me
A	oh okay
B	so I must be quite I'm uh finding it quite difficult to expand on my answers rather than stop and ask you a question and let you talk rather than me
B	well not really otherwise you won't get enough of me
A	oh no no that's fine too I mean I'm I use British speech so I'm I'm a guinea pig as well as a recorder
B	yeah but you can't be a guinea pig on every one can you? Em but em forgotten what I was saying there the aw yeah whether I like it
A	mhm
B	em and I sat down with the wife one day and I'd been a member of David Lloyd for about ten years
A	oh yeah?
B	and and she simply said well you spend all of your non working life at David Lloyd's why don't you go work for them? And and that's how it happened
A	mm
B	I em it took me about seven months
A	mm
A	mhm
B	well you know if you looked on a map the bit this way round if you were looking really at the bit
A	right
B	well Manchester in the middle above Manchester is Bolton and above Bolton is
A	okay
B	yep okay
A	mm
B	eh
A	there you go you absolutely took me to the letter on that
B	I will I did due just then so
B	I must
B	yeah
A	no I went to em to see a kind of life coach cos I've just found myself in the position where I'm trying to get a new career and
B	mm
B	well nothing about him's normally random but
A	could have said Harrison Ford
B	did well did this this funnily enough I've I've got a life coaching quality
A	oh yeah?
B	but em there's a book that you'd probably be interested in which is called Stop Talking Start Doing and it takes you through that sort of process
A	okay
B	it's very very good and it's really a really easy read
A	aha
B	stop Talking Start Doing
A	start Doing
B	and em and there's
A	mm
B	so it very similar to what you just said
A	yeah yeah
B	so what was the outcome of all this for you?
B	suffering from?
A	oh yes
B	okay
A	and um take a chance on trying to get into English language teaching publishing
B	right okay
A	because eh one of my
B	and that's how this came about or?
A	no this is just a freelance stop gap just to have a little project while I'm sending off job applications and hopefully getting interviews but em no it's because I was ranting and raving about how I really
B	but but can can I ask you a question?
A	yeah sure
B	you used a specific word there
A	mhm
B	did she use that word why? Just from a coaching point of view why is deemed as quite critical question
A	aha
B	just cos it it it's kinda saying to it it it's almost saying to somebody why did you make that choice? So so you probably say what was it about that that stopped?
A	yeah I think she probably did I don't remember exactly
B	oh right yeah yeah
A	Neuro Linguistic
B	processing
A	processing
B	em well actually both
A	it is?
B	but you can  you can  have both of them
A	yeah no I I'd find it extremely interesting but I'm sure she's a she's like a
B	Brewer
A	visionary in that field so she's ah probably got her question words right it was me that was probably reporting them to be wrong
A	no it was probably s
B	yeah
A	the the fact that a teacher a as a teacher you need to be able to lay the foundations of a good class by planning it well and making sure that your resources are quality resources that are going to aid the learning process
B	mhm
A	by making sure that the materials are quality and reliable
B	mhm
A	and except in the PGCE and and the classes and the schools I observed and taught in there was no reliance on quality published materials
B	oh wow
A	times Educational Supplement em and
B	so did they have consistency?
A	no there was no consistency these kids didn't have a class book
B	mm mm mm
A	yes exactly
B	yeah
A	yep yep
B	that kind of stuff
A	definitely and I think eighty percent of language learners have a visual memory so the visuals are extremely important in language learning it helps you makes associations as you say but it also helps as a memory hook for you know you need a huge amount of new memory capacity to learn a language anything visual that can act as a hook to help you remember is is fantastic
B	yep yep
A	but you know those these kids were coming to class without any kind of books
B	so how  so how  how did you then assess them?
A	oh well it was all done on the basis of em assessment booklets every half term
B	right
A	yeah yeah they do
B	I mean what did you show the parents?
A	well the education nowadays is all about meeting targets and assigning levels to students so on the basis of the assessment you write down okay this kid is at level three A in their reading skills four B in their foreign language listening skills
B	and that's all you tell them?
A	and that's
B	oh right I guess I guess what I meant by that was I've got a seven year old or we've we've got a seven year old
A	oh right
B	uh and em when we go to em the school nights then outside the classroom for structure we got all our little times where they go in but outside the class is all of the kids' workbooks
A	right
B	so that you you sit and read all you get there twenty minutes early so you can sit and read all them workbooks done that term
A	fantastic
B	so that then you can either em pick up on anything that's in that workbook and talk to them about it or literally just see if that workbook corresponds with what they're saying to you and what that workbook corresponds with work you're doing with them at home
A	brilliant
B	yeah and then  and then  you go in and then they do the bit that you're talking about here which is should be  she should  she should be up to a C level and she's actually now at a B level great news da da da
A	mm
B	which is yeah fair enough
A	across all the subjects I think yeah maybe
B	of course it's secondary isn't it?
A	yeah secondary you've got a teacher for every subject but then still there's no reason why you shouldn't kids shouldn't be taking pride in creating an exercise book in class of the work that they've done or taking care of a classbook
B	mm mm
A	A course book a text book that kinda lays it down for them in a very nice visual way and you know engages them
B	so they didn't get into that at all?
A	no and so what I said to this life coach was that that is one of the main reasons that I don't I'm not gelling with this teaching methodology because
B	mm mm
A	so I said that and she said Well could you get into maybe have you though about getting into a career whereby you make these materials and I'd always kind of known that that existed but then I thought Aww yeah okay and so off that I've been very interested
B	and and and where and and where does that type of career live geographically? Is it all over the place or the the?
A	em well the the biggest  the biggest  companies are companies like Pearson Longman and uh Oxford University Press Cambridge University Press so in the big university towns
B	right
A	big publishing
B	and you'd be happy to live anywhere in the U
A	not anywhere
B	and and are you saying you're not London cos you've been there before and didn't like it or?
A	no well I have I lived in London for about six months
B	how old where you? Was that a long time or was?
A	ah it was  it was  when I was eighteen sorry eighteen years ago
B	it's interesting cos I eh I used to work for
A	aha
B	A long time ago
A	really?
B	with a passion
A	yeah yeah
B	em eh the the whole element of eh you you're never out of your work clothes for for no other reason then you you may as well stay in them and have a pint or go for a meal because it'll take you three hours to get home if you do it any other way
A	yeah that's exactly what was going on for me
B	all that kind of thing
A	I lived in
B	yeah it would to get across yeah
A	and it was em I mean back then I'd just finished university and I was just getting you know paid by the hour jobs just to keep myself going till I went to Spain
B	do you coach him?
A	no I'm a he's been talking here as well
B	oh talking to you
A	yeah so no so that's why I didn't like it
B	now you see I this is going to make it sound as though I'm a gipsy but em I used to work for
A	yeah yeah
B	em but em
A	right
B	things
A	right
B	that that so for instance when I saw your ah email actually I would tend to say to myself em Stephanie just say to myself
A	aha
B	I could do that with an ethnic name em or a non British name and within seconds of doing it
A	you'll have forgotten it
B	it'll have gone away
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it just eh I just really really difficult for me
A	yeah
B	em it it's the only way I've been able to learn any kind of foreign language is through play with my daughter
A	okay
B	em my daughter's school is is a school of excellence in Spanish
A	oh oh
B	as it happens
A	mhm super
B	so we do all all of the em the Christmas in Spanish we do em we do em animals when we're playing in Spanish
A	aha
B	but even now I can't remember but as soon as she started if she started doing them and playing them I'd then start getting into it more
A	right
B	so so even to the point where I think these you you can learn some of the languages by em on a  on a on a  CD that's got all animals on it for kids
B	I've actually thought I need that really
A	right
B	Cos as a job in the past I've spent a lot of time in the car getting from A to B
A	uh huh
B	I've always had em in the car
A	mm
B	and I  and I  persevered with them I mean I I bet I've had uh weeks of hours worth of listening to this
A	really? So it's not the repetition thing it's not the visual thing or the aural thing it's just
B	the playing thing it helps
A	yeah yeah
B	could be
A	maybe you should watch Dora the Explorer in Spanish
B	I do
A	with your  with your with your  daughter
B	she's too old for Dora the Explorer
B	now she is yeah
A	aww what a shame
B	yeah unfortunately even at seven years old
A	they grow up quickly don't they
B	ridiculous
A	oh dear
B	and then she gets an attitude from it as well
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	oh no
B	yeah exactly
A	mhm
B	em we we did quite a lot of coaching in this environment em and so my background is to do with that and when when we talk about coaching I always talk about this thing that I saw on Noddy
A	aha
B	I don't know if they did it on purpose but it it it was perfect example of a coaching process
A	oh yeah?
B	this em Noddy goes up to Big Ears' house and he goes one day and goes Noddy I've got a kite can you help me put it together so he helps him put it together
A	mhm
B	goes in a couple of days later with his bike my my bike's broken Noddy can you help me or Big Ears can you help me with this yeah course I can da da da
B	so Noddy goes up to his house one day and Big Ears and he knocks on the door and nobody answers and Big Ears in a  in a  beard goes behind him and um says can I help you? He says I'm looking for Big Ears my friend
B	real classic all the way down the line
A	well maybe they should put it in a corporate thing in Spanish
B	yeah well yeah then I'd learn two things
B	from a  from a  coaching point of view I can remember one guy he he said something to me that was really pertinent
B	and he kept saying this what would you do
B	and you follow down these routes and you find an answer
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but yeah really eh it was really
A	that's really interesting
B	powerful stuff
A	yeah I remember the um it was in a textbook actually a a a reading about um creativity
B	mhm
A	and one way to increase your creativity
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	is that if you've got a em let's say you've got a customer service issue you need to get customer services rights
A	mm
B	the the best way of getting it right is to get hold of people say I'll tell you what let's do it this way
A	right
B	the objective is to have the worst customer service in this business
B	tell me all the things that you'd do to create the worst customer service
A	mm
B	you'd do all those things and then just flip them on the head
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	em
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it's a really good way to do stuff like that
A	yeah that is a good way yeah yeah
B	em
A	no problem
B	do you mind me calling you
A	no no not at all
B	it was a pleasure
A	for your time
B	I'm going to
A	are you?
B	yeah I've got to go up to the other club
A	to the other centre
A	yeah
