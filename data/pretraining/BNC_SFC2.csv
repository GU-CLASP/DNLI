A	I dunno
B	so
A	okay
B	but
C	but I
B	why why did
C	well cos he wasn't doing it for ethical reasons he was just raised as a vegetarian and he
A	okay
C	he just avoided meat and then he was like oh I have no ethical objections and I'd like to try it so he made himself do it
A	interesting
B	yeah I really like fish like a lot and
A	even the wiggly ones as well
B	I like the idea of being a vegetarian
C	why?
B	I'd try it but I really sincerely doubt that they're gonna get a fish texture right
C	well but it would be like biologically identical
A	how would they do it though? would there be some sort of element of
C	what?
B	would the lab meat have a face?
A	no
C	no no I think they just you could just grow like a rump steak
A	but they're not gonna grow it from nothing so where has that come from?
C	they'll copy one I don't know
A	cos
C	I mean we know we already know like
A	yeah but would you not have had to have a cow in the first place and done something with that cow?
C	yeah but it's probably already done and it's for the good of like the future like you kill one cow so that they can all go free again and run around the cities
A	the cities
C	you know and go shopping
A	I don't know it seems a bit too hypothetical for me to say cos I wouldn't be able to I wouldn't have I haven't got the facts do you know what I mean? they haven't done it so I haven't got the facts so
C	yeah
A	I can't make
B	so you can't hypothetically decide whether or not you'll eat
A	I can't make an informed decision of whether I would or wouldn't
B	as in a
C	would you eat it if it was grown on the back of a mouse?
A	no
A	of course I wouldn't
A	no
B	oh yeah I think I remember that
A	I just thought I'm not doing it I'm not coping I can't cope with this
B	it's too sad
C	yeah you're actually right I
A	then this
C	because
A	yeah
C	and it's
A	would they be exploiting you know?
C	nothing comes from nowhere yeah
B	you can't just pluck the vitamins out of the air
C	no
B	they have to come from somewhere
A	mm mm
B	because they've got to be extracted or created somehow
C	but it hasn't been done yet people think they're close but it hasn't been done
A	okay
C	so yes you'd have to
A	anywhere though that an
B	that makes sense cos that's a similar argument to the one about marginalised and oppressed people cos like if there's a motivation to oppress someone to extract labour and erm
A	yeah
B	services from them and then yeah then you
A	no
B	so yeah there's a motivation there to
A	and like behind everything as well where you think you're gonna be doing something like for the right reasons but then somebody like is probably you know like if you buy something and you think you're doing that for the right reasons there's probably some sort of like some child might have
B	there's always something like and that's the thing about the palm oil as well so you think you're eating clean and doing your best and buying seasonal food and it's like yeah but my peanut butter has palm oil which is really harmful to the environment
A	yeah
B	and everything's just buggered up
A	I know I
B	buggered
A	buggered
C	mm
B	lots of times
A	no it's nice
B	mm?
B	yeah go for it please do
A	thanks I will I will
B	you can move on up to the higher
A	there's a very limited bit of you know on it
B	rosemary?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	rosemary
B	are you looking for a scoop?
C	yeah
B	or a way to
C	I would like something
B	I don't know
C	I I doubt they're the worst I mean
B	do you think should I investigate whether the fishing practices that get molluscs are harmful to the environment?
C	yes I also think just reducing the amount you would eat would be doing a favour to the animals in some ways
A	but you should also look at erm who was involved with the farming industry problem
C	and different countries will have different
A	there might be people getting
B	yes
A	there might be people
C	mm mm but that's almost in everything and once you really get down to it
A	exactly
C	like you you basically
B	it's terrifying
C	stop eating
A	so that's probably so that's why I was a bit like well I couldn't commit myself to this erm
C	no no
A	lab meat thing cos there'll be cruelty somewhere
C	yeah and
A	cos there's cruelty in everything there's probably cruelty in this potato
B	cruel-free parsnips
C	and if you eat things that are only grown or made locally it's very expensive
C	you know erm you know if if I had all the money in the world it would be very nice
A	I know
C	but that isn't
B	well we'll need to make our house a smallholding
C	mm mm
B	where we have chickens
C	oh yeah
B	chickens good
A	well that would be good
C	yeah or the neighbourhood cat
A	to be honest she probably wouldn't know what to do with a chicken
B	well we've got foxes too but they only eat jam sandwiches
C	oh yeah
B	they wouldn't know what to do with
A	no
B	I think it's the wrong time of year it's getting dark too early
C	yeah
B	unfortunately
C	if you're ever at the sink keep an eye out out of the window
B	it's a good fox watching spot the sink
C	mm mm
A	okay
C	yeah I mean well
A	you would?
B	it wouldn't be your first choice would it
C	no
A	would you spend the day in an abattoir and not like cry?
C	no I mean I yeah I've never been in one
B	I've never been to one
C	but yeah maybe it would change my mind I don't know I feel like if I'm gonna eat meat then I should
A	yeah but that's what my counter-argument is that you couldn't you probably shouldn't
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I I think I probably could but
B	my my erm argument about being able to eat meat does often stem from the fact that I you know plucked and gutted birds that I saw alive only a few seconds earlier and I never pulled the trigger myself
A	no
B	just birds as well nothing else but like so the idea of like killing a pig or a cow or something
A	well I kind of erm
C	mm mm
B	but they don't
A	the farming industry isn't like that
C	mm mm
B	no
A	erm so
B	no exactly and you're right yeah it's not the same thing
B	it's it's a really I mean you're so right that me gutting and plucking a pheasant is not the same as me eating a factory-farmed chicken or cow or pig
A	yeah it's
B	it's not the same thing
A	and if it was your like your hunt like kind of instinctively you did that because you were hungry and blah blah blah blah blah yeah do it
C	mm
B	yeah yeah and that's like
A	because if you had to
B	you take all the food
A	for survival you would
B	yeah like you would take all the food that was on offer whether it was berries or birds
A	but like that's not
B	that's not the world we live in there's food aplenty
A	no
B	and
B	thing is my idyllic experience of you know the birds lived wild and free up until the moment of its death that it didn't see coming you know?
A	yeah
B	which is just like nature is you know
A	no
B	I get your point it is compelling
B	that's a one hundred percent why you are and should be a vegetarian
A	yeah I wouldn't
B	you wouldn't even if
A	but I'm also up I like agree in freedom of choice
B	yeah
A	in a way
B	yeah
C	er er yes
B	okay
C	yes
B	we could watch a Curb Your Enthusiasm even though it makes me slightly nervous
C	maybe this one won't it's a new season
B	oh I hope things go better for Larry
