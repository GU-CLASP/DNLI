A	I think I can stay up as late as your party needs to go on for
B	mm wanna pick me up at midnight?
A	yeah if you want
B	mm okay
A	but that will mean I'm left here with you know hordes of marauding trick-or-treaters
B	yeah
A	yes yeah well you'll
B	to
A	yeah cos I thought Halloween was Friday but actually it's Saturday
B	erm her I think
A	well you could definitely go to it
B	mm

B	no even if it was I wouldn't be wearing a pumpkin
A	can I get all the Halloween stuff out of the loft?
B	mm
A	like festoon you in it
B	if you feel the need
A	or is that just really crap? like it's I mean
B	yeah
A	obviously but that was why
B	I don't know any all
A	oh cos you don't know her friends right?
B	well I do but well
A	yeah but not yeah not not
B	mm
A	hell worst case scenario I can always just give you the money for a taxi you know?
B	that will cost you like a lot
A	taxis in
B	I could walk from and get the bus
A	sorry?
B	and the bus probably doesn't run at night
A	mm
B	it's
A	yeah but that's like eight miles away or something
B	what would I be supposed to take?
A	when I go to parties which obviously are a regular occurrence I take a bottle of wine
B	er mm I doubt that would go down very well with her parents
A	yeah so you might take I dunno I've got a few pumpkins
A	well I dunno crisps you well you could take like you know a Coke or whatever
B	I suppose
A	anyway you speak to her about it
B	it's not very good
A	I know you said it wasn't very good and
B	no
A	are saying it's the best one in years
B	I didn't really understand what was going on
A	mm
B	well you have to have you have to watched the last three like recently to understand
A	what the storyline isn't self-contained?
B	no which I thought was a bit shitty but you know
A	oh that's surprising yeah well I never understand what's going on though so it would you know make no difference to me at all
B	you don't even understand what's going on in James Bond?
A	no they're just jumping from roof to roof and there's a baddy normally
A	I mean
B	was odd
A	when I saw
A	a bit trying to be sophisticated not not over-the-top enough
B	yeah it was
A	but it flew through the building what and then what?
B	and and then it crashed
B	uhu
A	yeah and
B	what?
A	at night
B	going up a river
A	in London
B	in a boat?
A	in the dark and there was helicopters over it or something
B	no I don't think a helicopter over London isn't that difficult
A	well how do you know? because you can't you're not allowed to fly things over London you have to get like special dispensation obviously
B	they had to close a bridge and then
A	yeah and you have to get all the residents to agree well I don't suppose you have to get them all to agree
B	yeah I doubt they
A	but there are the some of the er
B	they were just driving a boat
A	well well it was in the paper
B	er
A	all about it
B	what did they actually crash a helicopter into London Bridge? I doubt it
A	that seems unlikely
B	mm
A	and how er
A	how they're like the the residents there are just completely fed up with it and the erm cos the council charge the film companies or whatever so they're happy for it to happen again and again and again but the people who live there are obviously getting irritated
B	I'm not sure why you'd be that irritated it's not like there are many like explosions or pyrotechnics with period dramas
A	no but those squares they're such a the
B	oh no
A	for two weeks well if somebody said I'm putting that up in my garden for two weeks I'd be pissed off
B	yeah but you wouldn't like stop them they're just posh
A	yeah I'm I'm I'm not defending rich people darling don't get the wrong end of the stick
B	yeah so
A	so well that's quite inconvenient
B	if she's an administrator you should do it yourself
A	well I haven't got the time but
B	there are quite a lot of unemployed people in Britain
A	there are quite a lot of unemployed people in Britain you're right and they have just been doing some advertising for some receptionist at my in the building I work in so I looked at these CVs cos it's just an administrative post like you say and luckily I didn't lead to look at most of the CVs cos in the covering email I could tell that they were illiterate and like the the my administrator sends you know emails to like proper people the she needs to use a capital I when she says I you know
A	er mm
B	oh oh no
B	mm
A	and she said yeah sure so that was that sorted
B	so that was lucky
B	is she literate?
A	yeah yeah yeah she's er like she's a grown-up erm like a proper grown-up professional with degrees and stuff and the reason that she's happy to be my administrator is
A	yeah exactly so she has erm her she's got her degrees are in marketing and journalism and that sort of thing and she's been a journalist in Australia she's an Australian and then she's been working in a laboratory in Africa for a year to do something or other and then she's come to England erm and so she doesn't have a particular kind of career path and she's been working with these erm one of my genetics ones on a marketing thing which was always going to be time limited and she was due to finish at Christmas but she's working full-time but she
B	run one?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	twenty-four twenty-four hours a day so yeah
B	maybe like Radio
A	yeah it's er well it's er mm Radio
B	called what Radio?
B	is there?
A	mm
B	a hospital has a radio frequency?
A	uhu hospitals always have had radio frequencies
B	what so you can
A	play
B	see who's
A	stuff on the
B	dying?
B	oh right yeah
A	and like every song is dedicated to somebody in the hospital
B	mm bit like tapping into their walkie-talkie radios cos to see if the relative was in a crash
A	no it's not for checking out who's who's in A and E this week
B	mm I think I saw it headlined somewhere
A	does that make you erm sort of scared?
B	I don't know what were the details?
A	well apparently it's a very good school highly regarded
B	yeah but what happened?
A	I dunno some other kid stabbed him
A	well this sounds like the kind of school where no one has knives
B	actually
B	erm
A	is he the one in
B	no
A	no is he
B	he's in mine he's alright he's bright but he just doesn't make very good decisions
A	yeah mm
B	yeah well they do now
A	well it doesn't stop anything does it?
B	I doubt that there is exactly like eagle eye watching them with the metal detectors
A	they're not like what?
B	they don't eagle eye always alert with the metal detectors at schools and
A	well I imagine they're like those ones at the airport though they can't be cos then
B	yeah er
A	then they are set
B	I mean the staff would not give a shit
A	well there must be one
A	well there erm in American schools they have police officers onsite as well mm
B	there is in London sometimes I think
A	oh there was a I saw on the news yesterday a police officer who just assaulted a student was sacked
B	why?
A	well cos he assaulted the student
B	yeah but why did he assault the student?
A	I don't know I think she was being misbehaving in the classroom so he was called in whereupon he just assaulted her
B	I think some schools in London have policemen
A	do you?
B	some schools in London
A	you think have police officers?
B	yeah I'm pretty sure someone in camp said that so mm
A	sorry?
B	pretty sure someone on camp said their school have one
A	well they I was thinking they might have one allocated like erm
A	you know he so he's kind of comes in regularly but he's not you know doesn't live there or whatever
B	of course he doesn't live there
A	you say that when
B	yeah thought
B	erm
A	yes he is
B	I don't see any reason at all to
A	did you go with daddy to drop them?
B	no
A	mm you seem to have spent a lot of the time on your own then this last few days have you no I suppose you were in the shop and then you were with
B	just
B	yeah I'm a lot tireder
A	yeah but it seems to be like sometimes you still get up at seven and other times you don't get up till eleven it's not like you started getting up at eight and then nine and then ten
B	yeah sometimes sometimes my alarm wakes me and sometimes I sleep through
A	oh I see
B	I think it depends cos I put it here it depends if I stick it on my bedside table or
A	your phone?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but you know I'm it's often at dad's it depends if
A	you must have got a
B	I've set it to full
A	oh okay and
B	er not usually well er Saturday I've got tennis and
A	yeah
B	I I think it is off for some
A	yeah I did think of emailing
A	to the other order you know you you know you laugh but probably no one's ever suggested it to him
B	yeah was I up at half five like
A	he doesn't get up at half five
B	I mean he gets up at like half past six
A	and seven yeah and he always has done he's never got up at five or half five it's always been six that he wakes
B	but I remember one time when I was about that age right just like until about nine
A	well I don't know
B	mm
A	I don't think
B	asleep
A	right no you missed that did you?
A	it was really heavy rain
B	I woke up at erm like well I woke up at seven to turn my alarm off then I went back to sleep and then I woke up a bit later when dad when to
A	right
A	erm it was
B	yeah yeah he said it was horrible
A	really
B	driving to
A	yeah and I was trying to
B	they've gotten off lightly haven't they?
A	sorry?
B	they've gotten off lightly haven't they?
A	well I don't know we'll have to wait and so anyway she says sure your boys will be fine and happy but driving home in extremely heavy rain yesterday morning I did wonder how it could possibly be fun
B	yeah
A	so erm I was gonna light the fire and sit in front of it and read a book
B	yeah
A	what are you going to do?
B	er I might read a bit I'll probably do some history research
A	do some for a history project you're doing what is it?
B	erm it's ten percent on Monday
A	it's ten percent on Monday? what does that mean?
B	ten percent of my GCSE
A	is er is that why it has to be handed in on Monday?
B	yeah yeah it's the exam on Monday it's like an hour of writing I think a twenty mark question
A	what you have exams
B	well it's a controlled assessment
A	oh I've heard of those
B	er five percent a few months like a month ago
A	okay what's it about?
B	erm the impact of liberalisation on society from nineteen fifty-nine to seventy-nine
A	uhu what's the key issues?
B	abortion
A	wrong
B	what?
A	wrong
B	legalisation
A	that's not the first one
B	of abortion
A	sorry?
B	legalisation of abortion what are you saying
A	no I'm not saying abortion's wrong
B	well
A	well so what are the other things you're going to list?
B	erm the four things that I know you're gonna say it should be women's rights but the four things we've been given
A	yes
B	are law changes
A	yes
B	which is the legalisation of abortion er the erm divorce reform act the legalisation of homosexuality and erm the abolition of the death penalty
A	oh so so you're only doing stuff to do with the law are you?
B	yeah we're only doing actual changes
A	changes in the law?
B	yeah that's under
A	under
B	divorce and abortion and stuff
B	yeah it's something to do with abortion
A	yeah but there was no I
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no well I suppose that was step forward
B	you had to be you had to be twenty-one
A	yeah
B	and in private
A	yeah and yeah I mean there was still a lot of erm
B	and the
A	a lot longer to come in
B	age of consent was only equalled in like two thousand and one
A	it is is that actually properly equal now?
B	I think so yeah but only
A	ah but
B	yeah two thousand and one
A	yeah they
B	and er you weren't allowed to be gay in the army
A	and yes
B	America was two thousand and eleven
A	I thought you still weren't allowed to be gay in the army
B	mm no
A	oh no you're allowed to be gay but you're not allowed to tell anyone it's like don't say don't ask they have this thing
B	oh
A	so
B	no it's sixteen it was eighteen in like the nineties and it's sixteen now
A	no no it was sixteen when I was growing up but at one point for homosexuals it was eighteen but there are issues
B	oh yeah right do you mean the age of consent for heterosexual people?
A	yes
B	oh right yeah that's like always been sixteen
A	yeah oh right so the so for gay people it went down to eighteen and then to
B	yeah
A	sixteen?
B	yeah
A	okay alright great right I mean how ridiculous that you like change the law just like still make it unequal
B	yeah well the same thing happened for
A	the same thing happened for what?
B	er for something else that the same thing happened they changed it but didn't do anything cos it was can't remember er but yeah it was abortion and it was still like really hard to get an abortion
A	yeah
B	two doctors had to agree that there was a significant health risk to the mother or the child
A	yes there was something about abortion the other day
B	yeah well the Catholic church is always pissing about
A	well and she said interestingly that she never expected us to keep all those rights first time round cos like ultimately all of this equality stuff is about ownership and ownership ultimately comes down to fertility and so like when the shit really hits the fan and stuff really starts to bite then people start to try to control fertility and that was her view
B	yeah twenty marks
A	okay and they're gonna ask what three three essay questions or something like that?
B	no just the one twenty mark question
A	one twenty mark question?
B	yeah
A	where you're gonna have to write about
B	what what
A	all these five things?
B	what was the impact of liberalisation
A	what er this liberalisation then it's maybe that means
B	it's people having more freedom to do as they they want
A	er and and you're interpreting that as as meaning through the through the law?
B	but but but that's how
A	having more freedom through the law?
B	Mrs
A	well I'm sure she's right
B	mm
A	okay right so are you gonna do some more revision then?
B	er maybe
A	okay I'll light the fire
