A	cos universities used to buy Suns because they were expensive
B	mm we had we had some Suns
A	I I mean they sold them more than anything they were kind of things people would have
B	mm
A	particularly or that many companies
B	well they were bigger sorts of things because you needed different sorts of stuff
A	yeah
B	cos we er our our OU system ran on one VAX computer
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh
B	and then we had four VAX computers A B C and D
B	it all linked in and then
A	were they big
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	there were four cos there was one of them and then they got four of them
A	yes
B	sort of spaced out in like one here about sort of maybe this bit
A	mm
B	bit taller than this little table perhaps
A	mm
B	I mean it's a long time I mean we're going back twenty twenty well a long time twenty-five years
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos
B	mm
A	these machines if there was a problem erm so you didn't
B	mm
A	to switching this off so you didn't
B	mm
A	sort of crash the
B	mm mm
A	or anything and erm I can't think what it was now something or other
A	no they did something naughty because it was er sort of see how quick cos
B	mm
A	but he can get moving erm when he wanted to and I don't know what somebody did I don't know whether some I I have a feeling it was something like erm putting some smoke near the fan so it gave the impression it was smoking
B	oh right oh yes yes
A	you know what I mean? so it's
B	yeah
A	so he said oh oh oh oh so of course you know so
B	mm
A	very quickly
B	mm
B	oh
A	naughty cos they were all naughty boys
B	yes
A	they were all naughty he wasn't er particularly in charge but you know they were naughty and they they they weren't being nasty nasty they were just naughty cos they did silly tricks on each other
B	so er were they other engineers?
A	yes
B	more youthful
B	more youthful spirits
A	yes yes but you know er
B	yes
A	and they were naughty cos they er they er weren't causing any damage
B	mm
A	because it was just you know this gave the impression but erm they were a bit lively
B	yes yes
A	yes naughty
B	sounds like people you could get a little bit fed up with
A	yes but they they er got er they got on alright with him
B	very often?
A	and played the flute well
B	oh I don't know
B	I hope he doesn't get
A	Anderson
A	Ian Ian Anderson who that that was his name but
B	mm
A	Jethro Tull
B	oh right did he stand on one leg?
A	Jethro Tull? Jethro Tull it's Jethro Tull's the group but Ian Anderson was the he played flute
B	well I've heard of
A	he looked like the Pied Piper
B	oh yes
A	and he used to wear these sort of erm
B	mm
A	sort of
B	oh
A	and twiddle about like
B	mm
A	the Pied Piper and he's very respectable now and wears tweeds and has a
B	has dogs
A	has an estate in Scotland
B	like somebody else we know
B	mm
A	the original
B	mm
A	whatever so erm they invited him to go
B	mm
B	mm
A	which he still wore then
B	oh
A	in his original outfit
B	mm mm
B	we've probably got a few more original outfits to look through haven't we?
A	yeah
B	who was that?
A	this was
B	oh probably very very respectable now probably own multimillion companies
A	oh er no he's he's he's er he's still a bit of a lively lad the thing is er he was er he was a
B	mm
A	erm but he wasn't academic but he was very bright
B	mm
A	erm good at sort of erm doing that sort of stuff he was extremely bright and quick but he wasn't sort of academic in that sense
B	mm
A	so he was er you know he he had to keep him occupied cos he was a bit of a live wire
B	mm
A	but he was a nice he wasn't nasty with it
B	but I guess a lot of the engineers now aren't that aren't really academic sort of people because it's moved to a a regular sort of
A	yeah
B	technical job now hasn't it?
A	yes
B	largely
A	yes
B	rather than being a academic skilled job on the
A	well it depends
B	thinking about the sort of people that
A	mm
B	working as the field engineers with whatever
A	yeah
B	what did
A	yes
B	and everything's got a computer in it these days hasn't it?
A	yes
B	whether they actually fix these things or even in the garage they clip the computer on now don't they?
A	yes but I mean it depended it's like at
B	mm
A	and then then they have the sort of
B	mm
A	and have to explain it to the managing director
B	mm
A	but you know it depends what level you're working at
B	yeah
A	cos
B	mm
A	and teach himself things
B	mm
A	like he was teaching himself that erm whatever it was was it TCP IP?
B	oh yes yes
A	or something he he was teaching himself that cos he kind of knew it but he was trying to do it all the bits he used to skip over he was trying to fill in the
B	mm
A	the gaps of it yes
B	I it it always tickles me TCP er because of TCP
A	I know
B	it is TCP isn't it?
A	TCP IP
B	the stuff that you don't use
A	TCP yes
B	the stuff we used to have a large bottle of as our
A	for putting on bites and things
B	on our for for our treating anything
A	yes
B	antiseptic
A	antiseptic yes
B	I don't think don't know if it's approved to do that these days
A	I think they
B	but did we have?
A	I think they still sell it or they used to sell it until very recently
B	it's probably got really harmful chemicals in it
A	it's probably got bought out by somebody
B	oh gargle
A	it was for gargling and you could put it on cuts but it was
B	oh
A	a bit oh
B	yes oh it was the only thing I ever had on cuts we didn't have Savlon or
A	you could put it on spotty things
B	Acriflex yes it went on everything
A	yes oh we I I erm we had Savlon sometimes
B	mm I don't remember Savlon I just remember TCP
A	yes it was in a no it it was it
B	yes
A	like a hexagonal
B	mm
A	you know before they were
B	yeah
A	just you used to get ointments
B	same sort of thing you'd get oil paint in
A	yes that kind of tube
B	mm
A	yes well it wasn't lead like an oil paint tin
B	no no
A	but it was metally
B	mm
B	so it's getting on for bedtime
A	think so I'm going to go and knit
B	erm what do you think we should do tomorrow? er can we do anything useful in
A	erm well if I move those boxes erm that box on the on the table is I believe is quite heavy
B	okay what do you think's in it?
A	but
B	is it glasses?
A	erm possibly I it'll say on it
B	oh right
A	there is a box that is quite heavy there's two boxes on that table I think or did I move one? anyway erm
B	yeah
A	can put it maybe on a chair
B	mm
A	or something
B	mm
A	cos I don't wanna put it down on the floor cos it's too heavy to pick up er
B	would that small table help?
A	I don't know whether it'll be too heavy on this table
B	well we don't want to break it it's a very important table do you have two of them?
A	no I only bought
B	mm
A	and er there was one that had got a few more knotholes
B	mm mm
A	and that was the best one so I bought it but they didn't have any more
B	mm
A	you know those ones they have that they call television tables or whatever? they
B	mm
A	and they have a a top like that they
B	mm
A	a few of these and they didn't get any more in
B	mm I thought about getting a couple of tables like this for
A	yes
A	yes
B	and they had some on Freecycle I think they were made of something that sounded quite I think it was bamboo
A	yeah
B	which I think er was it bamboo? no rubberwood
A	rubberwood yes
B	which I quite like actually
A	yes but it you have to check how they're fixed cos this one's quite good because
B	mm
A	it's got that little thing you twist
B	mm
A	but my that little brown one that's really an outside one you know the little one? there's a
B	oh right
A	brown criss-cross legs
B	yes yes
A	that's leaning on
B	yes
A	now that one you open it up and it clips into and it goes into a hook
B	mm
A	well if you pick it up
B	mm
A	unless you put your hand under and hold that it collapses
B	I'm very nervous about moving this one actually
A	well this one's alright cos it's got a peg
B	mm
A	it's got a peg in it as long as the peg's in it
B	mm
A	but it has a little peg
B	I didn't go for these rubberwood ones because I just really wasn't
A	yeah it depends how high they are but that little one that's why
B	they look quite nice
A	that little one's quite a nice just small size
B	mm
A	that's why I have it in the house
B	mm
A	but er that's why I tie string round the tops
B	mm mm
A	because
B	mm
A	you know you don't want it collapsing
B	you don't want it collapsing absolutely
A	and my little table that's at the side of the settee with the drop leaves
B	mm
A	the small ones it's all very well cos you pull out these things that hold the flaps up
B	mm
A	but if you put something heavy on one side it tips up
B	yes
A	it's alright if you put it on the sides where the solid bit is
B	mm yeah
A	but if you put it on the other side it tips up because it it
B	mm mm
A	which I didn't appreciate at the time
A	well it's made it's nicely made
B	mm
A	it's got
B	I think there were quite a few of those tables with a similar sort of problem
A	but if you buy one with the
B	mm
A	but they're obviously more expensive because what I used to do with that one was put one leaf up you know and have a half circle table
B	mm mm
A	next to me but you can't put things on one side
B	mm
A	yes I'm gonna have to go
B	oh okay
A	and knit somewhere
B	righty-ho I think we how would you feel about leaving the Archers until tomorrow?
A	oh we can do the Archers tomorrow
B	is that alright? okay
A	I'd forgotten it was an Archers day to be honest
B	oh yes it's not Saturday yet
A	I thought was thinking it cos we've had music on
B	yes that's true okay
