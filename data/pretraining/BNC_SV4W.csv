A	yeah do you like do you think that you are you looking for new jobs and stuff?
B	oh it's it's still on track like it's I'm still on track to be looking at different things and
A	yeah
B	whatever like a recruiter got in touch this week and was like hey there's a job in
B	no
A	no
B	they were like oh yeah but I thought you'd be on at least kind of this amount of money I was like yeah me too
A	yeah I work in publishing what do you expect?
B	yeah like no
A	I'm making no money
B	yeah erm so yeah but I think it's just it's just it was originally like September was my kind of deadline for definitely going but now I'm kind of like yeah maybe it's more likely to be December
A	yeah cos these
B	because obviously I need to wait for
A	yeah and it always always takes longer to get a job than what you expect
B	yeah exactly it's that kind of thing where you know I've got to
A	yeah
B	you do you know what I mean?
A	yeah no definitely
B	I I don't need a valid reason but it's just I don't know it's that kind of thing where
A	yeah
B	so much has changed that I'm kind of like let's see what it's like first it might actually be better cos they're putting more people on the subject or whatever it doesn't mean that I'm going to want to stay any longer but it means that
A	how long is your notice period?
B	two months
A	okay
B	that's why so it's that kind of thing where I'm like okay
A	yeah
B	that's why the like originally it was kind of September so obviously it's not September now
A	I know September is creeping up so quickly my housemate the other day asked me what am I doing for Christmas? I was like it's July?
B	so when is the lease on your flat?
A	January
B	January
A	it did we it was six months then we extended it for another six months erm and so it's till Christmas till January but erm actually also a part of me is contemplating going to Australia
B	what? what?
A	I know
B	every single time I see you there's a new plan I'm like what? I
A	I know it's cos well cos one of my friends is she's living with erm she's living in
B	okay
A	and she was like yeah come back with me and I was like oh yeah and then I was like actually maybe I could come back with you
B	right are you giving up the master's do you reckon?
A	I think so I don't think it's worth the money if I can't get enough out of it it would have been fine but they moved the exam a month forward
B	especially if you have a life oh no oh no
A	before my training
unknown_female	hello
B	hi
A	hi
unknown_female	are you ready to order?
A	yeah please could we have
B	two Bellinis

B	thank you very much
A	thanks very much I dunno it's just like with all my running training
B	mm
A	I have to run like three or four times a week and erm and I just don't know if they had left the the exam until the end of September I would have given it my best shot because it was after the Great North Run but I'd already signed up to do the Great North Run
B	yeah yeah
A	and I can't commit to I can't commit to it all it's too it's knackering me so and it I I had to pay another the next lump sum of money in August and I was like I don't feel comfortable paying out that much money and not doing it value so I'm going to revaluate and hopefully do it like actually do it as like a proper degree I think so
B	how are your mum and dad?
A	er mumsie and dadsie are okay they are at the moment they are in well they're going to Wales tomorrow for a week and they're taking my grandma with them to WalesWales
B	ah yeah Wales
A	and then they are going coming back for like three days
B	yeah
A	and then going to Stockholm for a week so
B	fair enough
A	yeah I know they
B	is that just their little holiday kind of thing?
A	yeah it's weird it's like the moment that me and my sister sod off they like start you know like being crazy yeah
B	having a life
A	and going on holiday and stuff
B	why couldn't they be crazy when you know you were around?
A	cos they had kids and they didn't have enough money
B	so how is
A	she's actually a bit sad this week erm she you know she's got polycystic ovaries?
B	yeah
A	well basically she's been having to take hormones to reduce the tumours on her ovaries
B	yeah
A	erm because they they're getting too big and they need to be op they might have to be operated on
B	right okay
A	erm so she's taking these hormones to try and shrink them but they're kind of all messing with her other hormones so
B	yeah
A	her serotonin levels were all up in the air place everything is going a bit haywire in her body and she's not she wasn't very happy this week I think she was a bit miserable but I rang I spoke obviously when I spoke to dad earlier he said he spoke to her and she was okay
B	yeah okay that's good
A	so I'm hoping that she's alright I think she will be she's always an upbeat person it's just
B	it's just that kind of getting used to it and
A	it's just yeah hormone changes so
B	I mean come on if the if the pill can turn people crazy
A	yeah exactly
B	then you know imagine what an actual full-on dose of hormones will do
A	yeah definitely
B	like are you going to see her at some point soon?
A	yeah we're hoping to go down for the last weekend in August the Bank Holiday weekend my mum's got some erm my mum and dad buy like ten tickets on the Eurostar
B	okay yeah
A	every year like a package erm and she's still got a few of those left left over to use so we're going to drive down in the that last Bank Holiday weekend and go visit her
B	nice
A	which will be very nice I love going to Paris and I miss it
B	yeah
A	but I'm going to Barcelona
B	yeah
A	I am going to Barcelona thank you
B	when are you going?
A	erm my birthday weekend
B	and who are you going with?
A	me
B	oh that'll be fun
A	it'll be good it will be really fun
B	have you booked where you're staying yet?
A	no no no literally
B	yeah have you got any set plans and dates?
A	er like they've done quite a lot thank you erm and they want to go to Barcelona and they were I was like well do you mind if I come next time? you know if you're going and she literally rang me on Thursday and was like me and
B	yeah yeah
A	and they and I rang
B	I mean I've done that I have done that it is like feasible but it you've just got to choose what you want to do
A	yeah but exactly but me and
B	so why wouldn't you go then?
A	cos you'd have to take a half day or a whole day on the Friday anyway because
B	yeah exactly where are you flying from?
B	yeah you
A	but you have to get to
B	but
A	but extra night or a
B	nice
A	I have never been and I'm so excited
B	I mean I am not your template of what to do in Barcelona so
B	no I I just drank sangria and had tapas sitting on the beach and walked
A	that's what me and
B	I quite liked it
A	was it nice? I really want to see the sun go down
B	mm
A	sounds really sad I realise but
B	no that's quite oh the let me know when you're well obviously you let me know when you're going but I think my guide book is hidden somewhere but I will try and root it out but you know there are there are lot of kind of cafes and things by the beach and then there's like a cable car that you can take
B	that's good because the cable car if you take it from the beach side over to the park you go near a rooftop bar that's actually quite nice cos you can see all obviously but you land pretty much there
A	yeah
B	so me and
A	love a rooftop bar
B	you know and you just look over the beach but you see the rest of Barcelona so it's like oh yeah that's that one that's that one that's that one
A	that's cool
B	cos obviously we didn't have we had what like a day and a half pretty much there
A	yeah cos that's why so me and
B	yeah it's the kind of thing that if you want to go and see the Gaudi or you want to see some of the art museums then you can do
A	yeah which I want to do
B	like that was the bit that I couldn't do
A	yeah
B	like I managed to see some of the stuff but not all of it I still would
A	are you which fountain?
B	the
A	ah I love a good old flashing
B	it's it's better than Vegas
A	I'm so sad really?
B	yeah
A	oh okay I'm going to see that
B	erm basically what we did was go
A	I'll have to have a look at it and does it go off like
B	yeah regular like every half an hour fifteen minutes something like that so
A	regularly okay
B	so yeah it's constant pretty much
A	yeah
B	it's tourist mad
A	yeah I can imagine I can imagine it's rammed it would be quite nice to go at like eleven o'clock though like at night when it's not as busy
B	yeah yeah and it's actually cos like you know all we saw a few places that they're used to people coming at ten like
A	yeah I can imagine I really can imagine but like me and
B	that'll be fine

B	that's fine you just you just wanted you just wanted to see me make a twit of myself falling down the stairs
A	I didn't no
B	at the concert which is possibly quite likely
A	it'll be fine it'll be
B	sorry I'm just like ah
A	I know there's randomly chickens wandering around but erm I know like I don't come across as the most like I won't mock let's just say that I won't mock or anything
B	yeah I know
A	I'll get involved
B	you you will get involved
A	I might mock a little bit but I will get involved at the same time
B	I am I am I am fully prepared for the mocking I've just had your voice in my head going oh god like
B	yeah or I can just imagine you will just say something to
B	yeah probs
A	I know it's not my fault I'm just an inappropriate person
B	you are but we love you for it
A	yeah I know where the line is and occasionally I cross it but most of the time I I I do hold back
B	ah no you'll be
A	yes exactly we went em me and
B	really? oh god
A	I know you're like boobs everywhere she was like really like chavvy looking and she was like do you think with a figure like this I've had children? and we're like whoa okay erm
B	forward
A	erm exactly and she was just awful and erm so me when me and
B	yeah
A	like we'd all kind of been like tiptoeing around the proper bitching
B	yeah and it was like bam
A	and it's like bam we can now officially bitch
B	the seal has been broken
A	yeah cos we were all kind of just like yeah it was okay you know there's this girl but she's a bit annoying and you know like and like not her other friends like they were her there was this girl called
B	there's a have you seen Ted? the film Ted?
A	oh yeah I have yeah
B	and you seen the bit where he reels off
A	yeah exactly and I felt awful like with the Essex girl but like
B	really?
A	cos she just gave off this like amazingly common vibe you know like you don't want to judge people
B	but yeah
A	but she just made it so easy to because she was just so ridiculously common and Essex
B	stereotypical
A	it was horrible
B	note to self
A	oh my god I think I'd die if I moved it's like you know
B	is he in
A	yeah he was in
B	okay cos that forgives everything
A	yeah obviously he's he's gorgeous like ah but he's from Essex so literally the moment he opens his mouth I feel like I want to like stab myself in the face
A	it's like yeah I would go on a date with you and just look at you but you just don't talk to me
B	no no
A	in my head it's all mapped out we'd have the perfect relationship if he never spoke
B	oh
A	he is a
B	oh no no no no no
A	oh he's beautiful
B	uh
A	not that I'm superficial or anything
B	no but a man has to look you know presentable
A	so
B	what's been going on with
B	has he has he kind of called it off after the whole kind of flirty but then
A	yeah what was the
B	really bitchy
A	when was what was the last thing I told you?
B	so like you'd kind of been like er you know us being like yeah he's just being you know an idiot cos he's been really flirty and then he was like raving about his girlfriend it was like dude just
A	yeah yeah I told him obviously to back off it was really inappropriate and then last week I don't know if I told you this he sent me a message being like oh yeah I'm sorry I haven't replied to you I'm moving into our apartment
B	yeah that's yeah
A	yeah and I was just like okay and then he's like yeah I'm moving in with my girlfriend and like and he was like oh yeah I told her she was really brave and I was like some would say brave others would say stupid
B	say stupid
A	each to their own and that was you know was the last thing he said cos he was like we're not all cynical like you
B	yeah
A	so
B	and if there's and if you're going to be friends can you really be friends with someone you can't trust?
A	it's just I just feel so sorry for his girlfriend like she's moving in with him and everything and then he's just like flirting with other people
B	I don't yeah I can't believe she moved from Australia she's moving in with him like I don't know
A	it just it just makes me feel a bit embarrassed for her
B	yeah but also not being funny but she's been with him for how long now?
A	not even a year
B	but long enough to be able to see through things
A	yeah yeah
B	it's long enough to pick up a vibe
A	like no no
B	and you don't know this girl and you don't know whether she's his equivalent
A	no not at all
B	like you know what I mean? like you just don't know
A	mm you just yeah it's kind of one of those things like if if my if I was seeing somebody and they were sending ex their ex text messages that he was sending me even though none of them were horrendously explicit
B	yeah no
A	I still wouldn't be happy
A	yeah
B	and I was like do I send a message? because I've never gone a time without sending a message but I don't want to
A	and it's and because because Facebook highlights it kind of one of those things that if I don't do it
B	yeah but it's one of those weird things
A	it's so obvious
B	so I look through the profile then decided not to but I kind of told
A	yeah
B	so you know it's that I don't know like
A	exes especially for like how long you were going or you were seeing
B	yeah if
A	but
B	like I was thinking like you know if if they were ever in trouble we would try and help them but
A	yeah of course
B	we've both kind of drawn a line and been like no I'm never going back there again I think like
A	yeah that's actually I
B	we've both moved on
A	on yeah and in Harper Lee's book it was in like her new one it's really good erm there's one line that says erm the other woman has turned into the psychiatrist's couch or men make men make the other woman a psychiatrist couch and I was like
B	yeah that's true
A	that is so right
B	that and that is what you were becoming like
A	yeah exactly
B	that's not your job
A	no
B	if you had that as a job you would get paid for it
A	yeah and sadly I didn't get paid anything for it
B	mm just just memories
A	just yeah it's like yeah I always would kind of like be interested in what's going on in his life you know like
B	yeah you care about him
A	but I don't want to I don't I don't you know when you knew that you love someone and you have those feelings I know that I don't love him anymore
B	no
A	and I know if I met him I wouldn't love him cos that's how I felt like I knew the other week cos when me and
B	mm
A	and this other girl in my friendship group was like really outrageously flirting with him and I realised if I had really liked him it would have bothered me and it didn't really bother me I was a little annoyed but not like
B	but not like hugely
A	massively yeah like you know if you really fancy somebody
B	oh yeah
A	you go out of your way to be like around them and
B	who is that? yeah
A	yeah exactly it's really weird cos
B	okay okay
A	and she's just like really like infatuated with him properly infatuated with him she knows she can't do anything but it's so funny cos she's like I went to this barbecue just cos I thought he was going to be there and he wasn't there
B	ah ah
A	and I was like ah but that's the kind of things you do if you really like someone isn't it? like
B	yeah it is
A	I remember when I was at school and I fancied this guy called
A	and I literally used to like know his timetable schedule
B	oh my god
A	so like when I was in a class he was I knew where he would be
B	stalking that's where the trouble starts
A	well cos there was like certain classes where we like clashed or something or where like he would be somewhere where I would be and like I'd bump into him and stuff
B	yeah yeah yeah see that's okay I I stayed behind for DT coursework sessions just so I could talk to the guy that I kind of liked
A	yep
B	yep
A	we all do things like this
B	standard
A	very very weird
B	yeah I miss being in school though there was a I didn't realise but er
A	oh yeah?
B	so
A	yeah
B	student I was like so what are you saying? she was like I'm still dong my ASs I was like okay
A	wow
B	so I was like oh they've taken on someone young for work experience but hey it's probably just a work experience week
A	how long is the work of it's for the summer isn't it? yeah
B	like the work
B	you know what
A	yeah I know what I was like at seventeen
B	oh my gosh
A	she's what?
B	to say she's got a mum that is
A	yeah
B	lovely but flaky she's got such a level head on her shoulders
A	really?
B	I kid you not she was kind of she was kind of like mm I'm not sure about what I want to do I want to make sure that the degree that I choose is the one that I want to do
A	yeah
B	cos she thought about doing graphic design and then a couple of weeks ago she turned round to me and she went no I think I want to do like European law with French or something
A	wow
B	and I was like wow that's a bit of a change but what is it that you know? and she's kind of like well I need to get these grades and I was like well have you looked at these unis or have you googled this search term or this search term? and I was sat with her with all the university stuff and it was really it was really good and she has got a really level head like level head on her shoulders which is really good but I have no idea what's going on with
A	yeah what is going on with
B	so she's said I didn't have a clue that's why I was trying to kind of figure it out but like the guy was there and it was like well
A	so weird so she was seeing some other guy so how long ago? that was like two weeks ago
B	right so she's been she's been like no so she's she's still with the guy that she was with a couple of months ago or a year ago or so she she's still with him obviously off and on
A	yeah
B	but they got back together after their big break up and what have you and blah blah blah
A	yeah
B	and then all of a sudden she's she through Facebook reconnects with this guy who was her friend from school
A	okay
B	turns out he's living in London great so they meet up they live in they when she goes to London they have a great time he comes to Oxford they have a great time erm and then you know she's been talking to me and she's like
A	oh no
B	and er but then obviously her boyfriend is still in the picture and then it's like okay then and then so this guy turned up they'd been skyping like every day and talking to each other all the time that they can so obviously like they like each other erm and I thought everything was going well like not as in like I don't know I didn't know whether they had crossed those lines or not or whether they were just hanging out but everything seemed okay he seems he seems like a nice guy he did all the washing up he says hi he's talkative
A	mm so is that the guy who was there tonight?
B	yes so erm and and he gets on with the kids like I think it's just like you know he's just my friend and I've got
A	yeah yeah
B	erm and then when she came back in that's why I was a bit like okay erm cos obviously it looked like she'd been
A	what tonight?
B	yeah as in like when I was coming back to get the washing cos I was like she's not okay and the kids aren't in I I hope that it's not you know nothing like
A	major yeah
B	major erm so that was
A	so is she over with the boyfriend?
B	no I don't know what the status is with the boyfriend
A	this woman gets so much action it's ridiculous like how like she's a very good looking woman but still wow
B	but it's like I was like I was thinking it's such a it's such a hard thing if you've got like a man and this is the case I was thinking this earlier like and one of the other girls that I went to uni with absolutely stunningly beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful but they can never find the right guy because the guys that throw themselves at them and they're so adoring of them that they will mistake that for love or something different and then you know it's always hard to tell but yeah so I I don't particularly know what's going on cos she just went
A	oh no no welcome to like go and have a long chat with her don't worry about me
B	oh no but she she won't no but she probably won't do if he's still staying
A	oh yeah if he's staying over yeah
B	I don't I don't know whether it is to do with the boyfriend I don't know whether it's to do with the guy I don't know whether it's to do with
A	but she kind of no offence but she kind of always puts herself in these predicaments
B	oh she so does like
A	like she doesn't help herself it's just like
B	this is what I was thinking I was like you know but I can understand it though because you know she is beautiful she's very talkative she's very sociable she's very chatty she's very amiable and she knows how to work people
A	yeah
B	erm
A	charismatic
B	very very very charismatic and you know? I just I just don't know but I just hope that she's okay I'm just like she doesn't half run herself through the emotional mill like
A	yeah
B	you know she was finally starting to get on her feet like she was made redundant and whatever
A	yeah has she got a job now?
B	yeah yeah yeah she's working at the university and that's going really well but
A	oh cool
B	it's it's the kind of thing where you know she's really put her back on her feet she was like no
A	yeah
B	so we'll just we'll just see I hope she's okay but it's probably just one of those things that'll blow over maybe it's not maybe it will be but I've
A	yeah I can imagine
B	yeah okay
A	drama
B	but you know it
A	yeah yeah of course
B	you know I'm just it's just you know and you've said this yourself it's hard to see someone in a situation where they're just going to hurt themselves but you know so we'll see but I don't think she probably won't confide in me or say anything until he's gone
A	yeah no yeah course yeah yeah
B	you know we'll see
A	but how are you and Mr
B	ah
A	is it all good?
B	yeah he's he's good we're we're much better having time apart was actually really good
A	yeah cos I know obviously the last time I saw you you were having a bit of a rough day with him?
B	oh that's the yeah like yeah but I think we've kind of I think that's just the kind of thing where like I was still struggling with like you know what is an expectation of a relationship? what is a relationship? what what isn't a relationship? you know
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	I think a relationship is whatever you feel is comfortable for you and them at the time isn't it?
B	yeah exactly and to be honest we haven't really we haven't really figured it out or more to the point we didn't you know we understood that it would be different but we didn't understand how it would be different and it's the kind of thing that you know with communication it's like well I'm going to fly off the handle or like you know
A	yeah
B	or you know and I think it's that kind of thing just been like actually
A	yeah
B	you know? cos it's the kind of thing that like oh this is was different a lot of the time it wasn't like I was being clingy but I was constantly aware that at some point
unknown_female	minute steak
B	yes please
A	er ooh yum
unknown_female	there you go
A	that looks amazing thank you
unknown_female	that's okay I'm just going to grab you a steak knife

B	mm
A	yeah
B	so it's the kind of things where we don't know what our revenue's going to be for erm for a couple of years yet so
A	people still loving
B	I don't think there's much to
A	really?
B	we don't have as much contact with him as like the er like
A	mm
B	mainly
A	good old
B	mm so yeah we've now got a tennis table table er a table tennis table
A	really? where?
B	you know as as you go out of reception?
A	mm
B	there's that little shady bit with the benches
A	mm
B	that little power station it's by there
A	what like an outdoor one?
B	mm
A	oh cool so erm where you're sitting in the same place aren't you? you didn't move in the restructure?
B	no no by everyone else who did
B	like media research and marketing design are still in the same place as well
A	I guess it's because media research was so small they didn't really know where to dump them then I guess actually project management was really small and they moved them
B	mm do you talk to the team much?
A	mm yeah I still contact I speak to
B	which guy?
A	I dunno just a guy she met I think he's quite old but
B	oh okay
A	you know each to their own erm everything's all ticking along apparently they're not erm re-recruiting for the project managers they're just leaving the three that there are and then they're going to let them literally just whittle down
B	mm
A	yeah
B	what about the ones in
A	erm ones in
B	would you like some more chips?
A	I might nick a chip in a moment yes
B	okay cos I'm going to pour them on my plate but
A	I'm
B	just just grab
A	I didn't even think I was this hungry
B	mm
A	movie tonight are we movieing?
B	maybe watch a movie I don't know how full we would be
A	mm
B	we'll have to choose something off Netflix
A	mm
B	er because my DVD player doesn't work
A	to be fair Netflix has a lot of choice going on so I think we'll be fine
B	unless you want to watch Celebrity MasterChef?
A	strangely enough that actually sounds really funny
B	I actually do love Celebrity MasterChef
A	I really like MasterChef I'm always in denial about it but I really like it
B	I love it I watched four episodes this week
A	really?
B	mm well what else am I supposed to do? I'm not allowed to go to the gym
A	true
B	I can't go out massively socialising
A	oh my god your social butterfly like inner self must be dying
B	yeah but it's the kind of thing that on some level I know it's good for me
A	mm definitely
B	but also I knew that this weekend would be busy so
A	yeah with all of us awesome people descending upon you
B	I was thinking that though just right before you arrive it's just you know how lucky I actually am you know? I have a nice group of people here but then you know friends like
A	me
B	that are willing to travel and my clan and you know obviously
A	he's your boyfriend
B	oh he's my boyfriend oh damn it
A	boyf
B	I still get have to get used to that
A	the boyf
B	to be honest I
A	whenever relationships are never
B	yeah I mean at the moment I make him happy he makes me happy we still have our own kind of lives it's the kind of thing where a lot of people are like oh so when are you going to move in together? it's like actually no we know that at some point we have to stop being
A	no
B	obviously we're together and we enjoy each other's company but it's I would never want to stand in the way of his career he would never want to stand in the way of mine
A	yeah no
B	he would never want to stand in the way of my friends and you know and I think that's the thing like it's a lot to do with the fact that like the expectation it wasn't even said it was kind of like oh I have to see you every week
A	yeah exactly you definitely don't have to see that person every week
B	and it's like oh like and that's what I mean like we talk a lot but it's the kind of thing of knowing you know actually you know we went four weeks without seeing each other
A	mm
B	and you know it wasn't brilliant but
A	it's not as bad as you think
B	we were okay as soon as we saw each other we were you know we were okay and I mean I wasn't with it half the time anyway so you know you can't really judge but it was you think like we were both just like actually you know now that was know we can survive it
A	I really enjoy having like time apart from people
B	it can it's more you know and it actually it's better to see people when you want to see them rather than when you feel like you have to
A	yeah cos then it becomes an obligation
B	yeah and it's the kind of thing that I'm just like actually yeah to be fair when are you supposed to see your friends like you know? he doesn't have as many as me or you know meet them as often cos you know guy friendships are slightly different but
A	yeah no but that's what
B	definitely
A	like I erm it was really good actually like
B	mm mm oh okay
A	and they're having a cocktail-making session at
B	but maybe that's a little bit intimidating though?
A	well no no cos
B	what would you do?
A	what would you do you know? you don't want to get back into that rut that you were before when you were going out and then you broke up and you kind of like she became really sociable again cos she didn't have a boyfriend and then the moment they got together she suddenly was like no no no I'm back with him I don't need my friends and I was like
B	yeah so what did she say to that? did she say anything to it?
A	she didn't she was actually I thought she was going to go really angry about it actually but then the next night she came downstairs she sat in the kitchen with me for like a good two hours we had a really good nice like bond we had a really nice chat she was like oh yeah okay so next Friday you know I'm I'm really up for it I'll come out and meet your friends you know like we'll get a taxi back together it'll be really fun and I was like yeah this is my best like this is my friend I genuinely felt like I was losing her cos all she does is sit in her bedroom and talk to her boyfriend and it's just it's so nice to think that like you now that you
B	and he said the and this is the thing he said the exact same thing not that either of us felt specifically but we were just like to be honest when we when we came into this neither of us wanted to you know give up our lives that we were having yes maybe less gallivanting for me would be good
A	mm
B	but it's like
A	yeah
B	it's kind of well actually you've got to put the work in
A	yeah
B	like you know and it's
A	yeah
B	and I went
A	yeah
B	so I kind of stayed in bed most of the afternoon and I was like
A	yeah I'm so sorry about that
B	no no no I'm just like I think it's more I think it was like I said to you I was like I'm so because I'm being told not to overdo things
A	yeah
B	or not to push through or not to do things I'm really hypersensitive to when other people say it so I was like don't like especially when it's things like your back I'm just like no cos if you ruin if you ruin that you could be ruined for months
A	yeah I couldn't drive they day I did it like pushing the clutch down was so painful I tried basically to I nearly had to call someone to come and drive my car home for me I was in so much pain it's better now like it's a bit sore and a bit tender but I can move
B	yeah
A	like the other day I genuinely couldn't even like bend down to like shave my legs it was horrible and like putting socks on like oh my god I never thought putting socks on would be a problem but it hurts so much
B	no but that's what I mean you can't take that for granted it's just like you know I knew that you wouldn't make anything of it unless it was particularly bad like for you to ring me I knew you were ringing me because you were like I haven't heard from you or I rang you I was like sorry my phone was on silent and upstairs I'm terrible erm
B	but erm when I rang you and you were like yeah I've hurt my back and I'm like yeah
A	I was so angry
B	you were like you were like I'll do I'll come I'll come and I was like I love you but if you do that you're even more stupid than
A	I was so angry about hurting it I was like it was my own stupidity completely
B	it's just one of those things though
A	yeah but
B	you're getting better
A	I am I did a session yesterday but he took it really really slow and everything so it was really nice erm yeah no it was good that you and
B	yeah we're okay like
A	do you like are you really confident that it you're more than friends? like it's not yeah
B	yeah like I mean he's really honest about it like he said a couple of weeks ago he was like look I know that that's one of the things that makes you different from being friends but you know I don't want that to be the only reason why you think that things are any different I'm like no it's not because the way that we are with each other it's it's it's not
A	yeah
B	and you know I think that's one of the things you know there are days that you know he could be more
unknown_female	are you all finished?
A	yes thank you yeah
unknown_female	how was everything?
B	brilliant
A	as you can see by the empty plates it was good
B	it was disgusting
B	it was horrible
unknown_female	did you want to see a dessert menu?
B	please
A	yes please
B	I've been told that these desserts are pretty good so er
A	they are
unknown_female	they are amazing
A	they are really good
B	you must come and give us all the recommendations apart from not everything on the menu
A	a sample of everything
unknown_female	chocolate sundae sticky toffee pudding
A	I love sticky toffee pudding so much
B	oh my god oh my word
unknown_female	thank you
A	thank you
B	yeah but I mean like there are days when we feel more like your best friend than your like boyfriend but you know and
A	yeah of course yeah
B	I've still got a lot to learn and he's still got a lot learn but actually you know I think it's more the fact that you know the thing is I know that if I fly off the handle he's not going to run away
A	yeah
B	if I'm ill and I'm terrible and I look disgusting or you know I'm not feeling like me I'm not chirpy I'm not happy I'm not sociable cos he has you know he had me crying in his car many a time because I didn't want to go back to work erm and I didn't want to go back to
A	yeah
B	you know it's like something that you get
A	he's a good boy
B	more you get even more faith in what you have and it's the kind of thing that like you know it's just
A	thank you
unknown_female	there you go
A	great yeah it's all
B	things are a lot easier so you know
A	it's all just yeah
B	we'll just we'll we'll see how it goes
A	it's normally always to do with overanalysing things that's where it goes wrong I find anyway
B	you'll you'll love it I read Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus and it explained a lot
A	see I've read that book and I kind of part of me was like oh that makes sense and part of me was like oh this is complete bollocks
B	yes that was my complete reaction and
A	yeah
B	well I said the exact same thing I was like some of it I agree with some of it's absolute bollocks
A	yeah some of it makes no sense
B	and you know it's the perfect I I was I was quite sweet I did something quite sweet don't throw up you know it's the kind of thing that he says oh you know I think there's ninety-nine or a hundred and one ways to score points with a woman
A	ah
B	I was like here you go I don't agree with all these so here are the hundred and one ways that you score points with me so I wrote them all out while he was asleep
A	yeah a hundred and one?
B	yeah
A	okay cos that's sad
B	and then he
A	a hundred and one how how on earth is there a hundred and one things that score with you?
B	cos it's just the small things like no it's not like
A	makes me a cup of tea
B	all the things that you know have meant a lot like the fact that you know
A	yeah
B	when I'm having a bad day he'll send me a picture of a bear waving he's like the bear still likes you
B	yeah exactly
A	ah
B	you know it's it's small things like that you know he's never going to be the world's biggest romantic speech writer
A	no
B	but
A	most men aren't though
B	I'm starting to get used to the fact that you know he is not a girl
A	yes
B	he is not me
A	no
B	as as great as he is
A	men are not women
B	he's not me yeah exactly and this is this is a lesson
A	it is oh
B	yeah I I'm looking at the cheese menu why?
B	oh oh right it is oh god
A	puddings
B	ah ooh
A	mm
B	ooh
A	yum
B	it will I'm really sad though the middle top line of the
A	prosecco and peach jelly
B	mm middle top line
A	oh strawberry Eton mess
B	yeah it's spelt wrong
A	oh Eton's spelt wrong oh no Eton's supposed to be spelt wrong though I think it's supposed to be funny isn't it?
B	is it? I don't know
A	oh maybe not that's embarrassing if it is we'll go with it's supposed to be trying to be funny
B	okay okay okay I'll go with you on that one
unknown_female	do you think you've decided?
A	did you decide?
B	yeah yeah
A	what are you going to go for?
B	er can I have the chocolate sundae please?
unknown_female	you can
A	can I have sticky toffee pudding please?
unknown_female	yeah
A	can I also grab a coffee?
unknown_female	yeah
A	erm do you want a coffee?
B	I might do I'm just going to look now
A	could I have a cappuccino please?
unknown_female	you can
A	thank you very much
B	er can I get a decaf latte?
unknown_female	yeah
A	a decaf latte?
B	yeah I can't I can't have caffeine
unknown_female	I'm the same if I go out for dinner I have to have decaf as well otherwise I'll be awake till like three in the morning
A	I was gonna ask for an extra shot
B	yeah you have mine if you want them you can have mine
A	okay so
B	it's an ice cream van
A	I know thank you
B	competition oh oh erm no I I actually you know can't eat or drink that many things with caffeine in them so
A	yeah
B	you know coffee no no
A	I get that don't worry
B	tea is also a no-no which is quite sad
A	I was watching a Michael McIntyre episode not episode but like
B	I love how the conversation is just so random
A	I know I know our conversations just dot around don't they? and we'll kind of go off on a tangent and come back to what we were originally talking about
B	right let's start a serious conversation
A	Michael McIntyre
B	Michael McIntyre
A	well no he talks through caffeine it was like a sketch with him and he was talking about caffeine how like if your partner ever offered you a
B	can you imagine him on caffeine?
A	I know he's buzzing isn't he? but like he's like if your partner offers you a cup of coffee at eleven o'clock at night you'd be like what no? why do I want coffee at eleven o'clock at night you go to a restaurant everybody orders coffee at eleven o'clock at night it's just like why?
B	it's all about the context it's like
A	yeah why do people order coffee at the restaurant but they won't drink it at home? and I was like I drink it at home so it doesn't make sense but for other people I don't know
B	it really does though cos I will not choose to drink coffee
A	no
B	unless I'm really really tired
A	yeah
B	or it's a treat because I know that the coffee that I would have is not as good as the coffee that other people would give me like my auntie and uncle proper coffee connoisseurs I'm like if I go to theirs I have the coffee
A	yeah oh my god I would love to meet your aunt and uncle I love coffee
B	yeah I know well that's what I was going to say like erm the next time there's a V and A thing that we want to go to we can invite her along cos she's
A	yeah that's cool
B	she's with the art fund and what have you so
A	so many people have said to me like oh so what erm what are you doing in London? when I was going to visit you I was like I'm going to the Victoria and Albert museum they're like oh that's cool I'm like yeah I'm a member
A	like I know me too
B	cos I'm a co-member but
A	well
B	that is cool
A	I know I know
B	but the thing is that with
A	yeah that's what he said he was like do you want to come on some National Trust days with me? I was like yes
B	ah I'd love to go on a National Trust day with
A	I know
B	that'd be really fun
A	he was like you're the only like one of the only people I can ask everybody else would laugh at me
B	aw
A	I was like no no no
B	what a legend
A	I'm a member of the Victoria and Albert museum you're member of the National Trust together we're like the oldest weirdest people we're like the weirdest twenty-three year olds
B	it was it was really funny like erm er last weekend everybody was like ah so er they knew that I was busy on the Sunday so I wouldn't be around and they were like oh so what what are you doing? I was like I'm going to the V and A like with one of my best friends like you know it's just it's just one of the things that we do and they were like oh yeah what exhibit are you going to see? luckily this time is was not wedding dresses which it was on the first night that I met
A	yeah
B	it was probably going to go in the wedding speech if there is one
A	yeah
B	erm or one of your speeches
A	what what?
B	yeah pretty much erm but er you know and I was like oh it's about shoes I'm like
A	so many people said that to me I was like I went to this Hollywood exhibition I went to this wedding dress exhibition I went to this couture icon McQueen exhibition I went shoe exhibition you hear some people are like that's really cool other people are just like
B	why?
A	that sounds shit it's like a Marmite
B	it really is but erm there's a Hepburn exhibition at the
A	really? ooh
B	I would love to go there
A	yeah
B	like looking at all her stuff cos they've got like screenings and stuff like that as well as all of the old films even the ones that I haven't heard of
A	oh my god yeah okay let me know I'd be up for that
B	so I was like ooh ooh there's loads of stuff going on for ages and they're tweeting about it like mad so
A	I'd definitely go I like Audrey Hepburn's pretty
B	I love Audrey Hepburn it's like if I were Audrey Hepburn my life would be pretty much made like yeah
A	it's like Victoria and Albert museum exhibitions are really cool cos my erm boss the American who I didn't think liked me originally but I think she's growing on me
B	oh yeah that one the brownie points one
A	yeah she erm she likes the Victoria and Albert museum and she went to the Alexander McQueen exhibition the shoe exhibition and stuff so it gives us something to like talk about
B	yeah oh my auntie's going to the Alexander McQueen I think it might be tonight actually
A	cos yeah you sent me that link they're extending it aren't they? cos it's so popular
B	yeah and they're doing a twenty-four hour kind of opening which is fab
A	they must be making so much money out of that
B	yeah but you can imagine how much money it actually costs to put on as well
A	I was thinking that do they get like the clothes donated to them or do they have to pay there to exhibit them?
B	erm could be a bit of both
A	yeah
B	for particular pieces it could be a but usually stuff is like on loan
A	yeah
B	that either they get their name published in the
A	yeah yeah definitely it was actually an amazing exhibition wasn't it?
B	it's such a I was trying to I was trying to explain to it my auntie cos like you know I was like I'm no fashion expert but
A	no
B	the way that the exhibits were staged like I was trying to explain it to her that you know as you go in you think mm really?
A	yeah
B	monochrome is a bit kind of basic but then as it goes on it gets more and more sophisticated and you'll go from one minute being in a room full of skulls
A	yeah
B	to the next minute being in a really really bright red driven traditional more normal looking clothes
A	mm exactly
B	and then you'll go through to the big finale which is obviously the cabinet of curiosities
A	yeah
B	and like I was a bit like there's there were too many people in there
A	there was they let in too many people
B	to enjoy it
A	I can understand why the wanted to get so many people through because so many people wanted to see the exhibition but
B	it was full I'm not being funny but I am being funny it's the kind of things where it's like people with prams don't do it
A	yeah no people with people with prams there are so many places they should not go
B	I mean like I you know
A	you can't discriminate but
B	definitely you should go but that with that many people
A	but why would your kid even yeah? why would you take it? it's just
B	well I suppose you have to but
A	yeah
B	it's the kind of thing where it's like let them in at a time when there's not so many people walking round cos it's not just that you're kind of having to move a pram it's more like what if somebody trips or elbows or you know? it's just not safe
A	yeah
B	but like
A	they did let too many people in but it was a stunning exhibition wasn't it?
B	although my my auntie's niece on the other side of the family erm is doing her PhD in fashion like kind of history more textile kind of thing
A	yeah
B	erm but she did a lot of work with the V and A and we were and she doesn't really talk that much but she definitely started talking about the exhibit and we actually had quite a bit of a conversation about it and it was great but you know erm
A	yeah it's it's just a really
B	it's a really really good one I hope
A	stunning one
B	but I honestly don't think it would have been as good if it hadn't have been in the Met cos it was the Met over in America
A	yeah
B	that had staged it all and then we just nicked the staging so it was the kind of thing that if we hadn't have done if they hadn't have done it first we would never have come up with something so elaborate and so dramatic in a way
A	no no it was that box of that box of curiosities at the end wasn't it? that was intense that was you just walked in and it felt like a creepy children's film but beautiful at the same time
B	and also yeah and also the bit that was just after the Kate Moss thing where
A	yeah that was stunning
B	that was so cool
A	that was so clever
B	and then like you know I'm all about like I'm not really about the skulls or the random heads of things or
A	no and like that wildlife one you know like the African one I was a bit like no I would wear any of those
B	that was a bit like I'm a bit freaked out right now I mean
A	yeah I don't think I would wear any of those clothes really but
B	no you wouldn't wear anything it was the most weird kind of dinosaur shoes that's like dinosaur egg shoes that's the only way I can describe them
A	you can understand why Lady Gaga liked him so much
B	oh yeah
A	can't you? definitely right up her alley
B	yeah but it I honestly think that you know I think this is this is what it said anyway in one of the kind of texts was that you know those and it was like I was saying to you before it was like those people were on such a different creative plane
A	yeah
B	that no wonder they feel so isolated or so different or just on a different level it doesn't mean it's any better but it's a very different way of thinking and approaching things which is great
A	no mm
B	but it also means that you know with great power they are
A	yeah cos he obviously was so not messed up but there's something so bad
B	obviously so in turmoil like you know

B	I did I was like give me pudding
A	thank you
B	thank you very much
A	er
B	yeah I was just thinking custard rather than ice cream
A	I don't know I quite like I quite like the hot and the cold
B	yeah sometimes it's good sometimes like I think in winter you definitely need the custard rather than the thing
A	mm
B	er er
A	oh my
A	and guess what I started watching recently?
B	what?
A	the Gilmore Girls
B	really?
A	the theme tune is now my phone ringtone
B	oh my good grief
B	erm I might go on watch it have you got Netflix?
A	I do have Netflix yeah
B	have you watched Sense Eight?
A	I haven't but I've heard it's good
B	it is good yeah it's a bit weird at first but you have to kind of stick with it
A	mm
B	but it is really good
A	I heard that about it
B	some of it
A	yeah
B	but it knows that
A	mm
B	it's more that
unknown_female	okay the cappuccino?
A	oh that's me please thank you
unknown_female	there you go
B	thank you
unknown_female	okay thank you
B	but it's also it's got about eight characters
A	oh yeah it's not too many
B	main characters
A	oh
B	but they interchange between their stories in a way that actually means that you relate to the series more that by the time of it you're not into it because of the story
A	yeah
B	you're into it because of the characters
A	yeah which to be fair is what you would want really isn't it? mm
B	so
A	I was watching Daredevil
B	I love Daredevil
A	do you love it?
B	I really like it
A	I I was kind of like on the fence about it I've still got two episodes to watch or one episode to go or something I I've been battling through it
B	yeah
A	it was alright but I wouldn't say it's a
B	it's
A	yeah definitely very slow erm also just really unrealistic I'm sorry but I realised it was a like based on a cartoon so that's fine
B	you like take it up with Marvels not Netflix
A	erm what else? also I watched Orange is the New Black
B	what do you think?
A	I haven't finished season three I've nearly finished season three
B	mm
A	it's not bad it's a bit gets a bit boring but
B	yeah Piper bores me
A	mm oh my god I want to punch Piper in the face
B	oh and Alex
A	yeah
B	mm I love Tasty
A	which one's Tasty?
B	that girl with the curly hair
A	yeah two of them look very similar don't they?
B	the one who used to work in the library
A	oh yeah I like her she's good
B	and the one that spoke German
A	oh yeah
B	but that's what I like it's more the ensemble cast that are
A	mm
B	carrying it now than the actual main characters
A	yeah Piper's just so whiny oh my god Piper shut up
B	but erm Red I love Red she's grown on me a lot more and the Spanish you know girls I find them hilarious
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh
B	really?
A	yeah
B	I always have to finish them
A	I'm really bad
B	this is really good
A	I love how you are just like whacking your spoon in and it's like pulling out the entire thing
B	it's because the berries are at the bottom and I don't want to be left with the berries at the end
A	mm who would want to be left with berries uh fruit? what?
B	that's why I'm hunting for the berries
B	like er
A	hunting for those berries they're hiding from you
B	they are honestly they're quite difficult to get out
A	mm
B	doing my happy food dance from side to side that's how you know that I'm like mm yeah
A	mm
B	don't ask me why it's so good but it is I think it's the hot and the cold
A	you can't beat like coffee and dessert
B	not like a good coffee
A	no
B	this is good coffee
A	yeah it really annoys me when someone offers me a coffee and then gives me like instant
A	it's not as good
B	oh yeah no it's not the same but
A	I do drink it but it's not as good
B	mm
A	mm so obviously our winter holiday
B	yeah
A	are you planning any summer holidays any summer trips with
B	em not at the moment I think I need to confirm my dad's been toying with the idea of going to Ireland
A	mm
B	erm for a week originally we would have gone at Christmas
A	yeah
B	but my grandma's been slightly poorly so he kind of wants to go when she's we know that she's well rather than suffering the cold or something so I need to figure that out first
A	yeah
B	and to be honest I don't feel right telling work that I'm on a
A	yeah exactly yeah definitely
B	so I think it's more going to be towards autumn winter
A	wow yeah
B	so I've got quite a lot to use up so it's kind of like mm I can go on holiday all the time
A	and also you can take a like a nice long Christmas can't you? if you wanted
B	mm yeah it depends it depends where we are to be honest
A	yeah
B	erm if we're just in one place then that's fine but if we're in two places it makes more sense to take a longer break
A	and it depends if you get a new job
B	oh true
A	scary times
B	mm
A	to be fair it was this time last year that I started looking and new jobs and stuff so
B	yeah to be fair it's just changed so much in a year it's kind of like your brain just needs to process all the change first
A	mm yeah you don't want to end up in like them taking you to a like advantage of you again do you? and like falling back into that like situation
B	no definitely not but it was quite nice
A	what having time off or?
B	oh yeah
B	but the team the team I worked with in
A	mm so you think you might want to move to the
B	they could but I don't think they would well they might do now that we've changed the managing structure
A	yeah
B	cos technically I wouldn't really be reporting into to anyone that often anyway so
A	yeah
B	and there is a precedent tattoo
A	huh?
B	tattoo
A	really he moved to London
B	where he moved to London
A	oh okay
B	so there is a precedent erm but they're they're really funny like they will tell they're very blunt you would you would rate them they're very very funny and er they they like me so that's good
A	obviously everybody likes you
B	but you know? they were a lot better to me than the marketing department they were much nicer to me in terms of when I got back all of them were instantly on chat like once they seen I sent an email to one of them oh my gosh you're back what are we going to do without you? like this is this is crazy we don't want you to leave ever
A	mm
B	or like you know it's the kind of thing or like all of them kind of emailed me and when
A	that something happened
B	yeah and erm
A	shit went down
B	yeah and it was kind of thing that I sent an email going hey I'm not going to be around for a little while erm you know
A	yeah
B	are you going home? go and get some TLC I'll meet you for a
A	oh that's cool
B	she's like I'll meet you for a coffee if you want but if you don't that's fine but just keep in touch while you're off not about work but just let us know how you are?
A	mm
B	erm and then you know it was kind of they were like oh my gosh it was only when you were gone that we realised how good and how quickly and how well you do things
A	yeah
B	because the stuff that we you would usually get done in a day it took two or three meetings for other people to get their heads round like what is that?
A	also not just stopping you well stopping you but that couple who sat next to us were the weirdest couple what was?
B	they were odd
A	they were really bizarre like he spent the whole time on his mobile she looked liked she'd rather be like anywhere but here oh he's coming back wait there stop talking
B	like please please please stop
A	yeah
B	well like
A	do
B	yeah er
B	tattoo
A	what's he what's he got promoted in
B	digital services manager whatever that is
A	did that cause a bit of tension between him and
B	I don't know because nobody really wanted that job
A	oh
B	and they all got told that they should apply for it and everyone was like meh erm
A	oh the ginger-haired woman who got married a few years ago?
B	yeah and
A	everybody wants more money yeah
B	no but it's fair enough after like five seven? seven? is it seven years?
A	yeah wow he's been on the same salary for seven years?
B	not the same subject but the same
A	no the same salary kind of thing
B	well it would keep going up I'm assuming but not very much
A	yeah but not very much
B	and what was interesting was that this restructure it was like no I don't believe in giving people pay rises within their roles like not as in like substantial ones I I believe they should just be paid for their role
A	who said that?
B	the über marketing director
A	bollocks
B	in which case I one of my questions to them is are you going to make it transparent what the salary bands are? because I know that I deserve to be paid a damn lot more than I have been because I would argue okay yeah maybe I'm not doing the extra projects that other senior execs are doing
A	you're busy as hell
B	but I am busy as hell and I'm doing a lot more than some of them have been doing
A	yeah
B	I mean everybody is über busy and flat out right now which is you know there's no comparison but it's not like I think I should be promoted I just think I deserve a little bit more
A	I think you should leave anyway
B	oh yeah I know
A	I don't you're not happy and it like you obviously now you're getting a bit better and you were worked too hard but if you were crying in a car because you didn't want to go back to work you should not be spending your twenties crying in a car hating your job
B	yeah exactly doing that no of course not but it's also that kind of thing that it's more that I've got to I feel that I've got to prove that I'm well enough to do the work that I've got
A	yeah of course you do yeah
B	and feel comfortable within it myself but also from that lesson be like no I'm not doing that
A	yeah definitely
B	and it's one of the things that I'm like right okay you've got this restructure but what are you wanting me to do? because I will tell you flat out if it's not if it's too much
A	yeah
B	you know I'm just like I will tell you flat out if it's too much and you've already got the warning of why that's not a good thing so you can't do that again anymore you can't just pile it on and expect me to be okay with it
A	yeah
B	if you do you know and marketing were blaming
A	yeah you've done this to me
B	you're the idiots who've done it
A	yeah
B	but you know like I feel less I feel so much less bothered
A	yeah
B	about it not in a bad way not as in like I don't want to do well or I don't want to do my job I still you know enjoy my job I'm good at it but I just don't care as much anymore I'm not as invested or like feel that it's all on me
A	yeah it's not all on you yeah
B	well that's what I mean it's that kind of thing I'm just like actually now it's like
A	no
B	but it's waiting for that right opportunity to come along the er the
A	no not at all
B	that would be okay some people would be like yeah that's a wise move but
A	yeah of course
B	I can go for a full-time role but I've just been off work
A	but I've just been ill yeah
B	yeah it's it's just not
A	no
B	it's not a good thing it's much better for me to be like yeah okay there was one period of illness that I had while I've been working over the last three years er I got the help that I needed I put the tactics and the management skills in place
A	you've learnt from it and you're sorted
B	exactly do you know what I mean? that's a much more positive story to give rather than I'm still on
A	yeah
B	you know if I were going for any job like supermarket retail office you know temp job
A	yeah definitely
B	it'd be alright but no I want a job that you know I'm interested but I know that I also need to scale what the job's going to be and if I don't get myself
