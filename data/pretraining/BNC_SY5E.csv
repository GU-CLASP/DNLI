B	so that race was supposed to have more horses they've just been?
A	been pulled out cos of the weather
B	ah
A	nothing
B	they'll pull horses out even if the race is still running?
A	no it was before
B	yeah but I mean
A	an hour before they can say no it's too soft
B	like they don't like the
A	yeah
B	ah
A	so instead of having eleven horses then I'd've got a good place
B	see I just thought it if was like
A	no
B	race was going I assumed
A	no
B	that you could
A	no the trainer can pull them out with that in within an hour of the it going off
B	oh
A	there's seven runners I want them two out
B	and lose yeah?
A	oh you've fucking had it
B	what if you're betting on a non-runner you just don't make a bet
A	get oh you get your money
B	for that individual one?
A	yeah for that one horse
B	it really stitches people up though doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	I bet people have lost good money through that
A	yeah
B	probably fixed though isn't it? is it fixed?
B	no
B	we should have a day up the tracks again this year
A	yeah
B	is there?
A	yeah
B	let's go to
A	ain't this week but you

A	yeah
B	won over twenty and went over a hundred and twenty that day
A	erm
B	didn't bother working
A	I can't think how much that was
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	it is a rip-off
A	totally
B	it's a complete rip-off
A	yeah
B	yuppie types yuppies
A	and all the old all the old junk shops you go in
B	no
A	they didn't buy it they fucking put it down
B	people there are really
A	no
B	well it's a good university and it's a good location to do

A	you walk from here to fucking
B	yeah
A	big main road
B	yeah
A	you forget the parking
B	there shouldn't be too many chavy people around should there?
A	no
B	too expensive
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos I don't think that one you went to that day on the seafront was a good idea
B	eighteen quid for three and a half hours
A	no if we'd've gone up a bit further
B	yeah
A	about four empty
B	well you might've still had to pay for them but it wouldn't've been expensive
A	no
B	I'll have to look that up actually
A	well exactly if you're
B	do disabled badges
A	yeah
B	are there free passes
A	I'm sure it's free parking
B	no
A	no
B	if it's in the town you might be alright
A	it's up towards the town a bit

A	I mean that
B	why cos it one way?
B	turnings
A	if you take the wrong fucking turning like my mum did we went round the block twice
B	well that's why you need your if you listen to the sat nav you won't go round the block twice though will you?
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she's hooked on that
B	I don't know why cos she never does anything on it
A	no no
B	she just noses on what other people are doing
A	she just noses on what's going on
B	I do see on her on it she's like a teenager
B	just ask to use her phone to look at Facebook
A	yeah
B	she gets her notification
A	that what they're called?
B	yeah you get a notification
B	something happens
A	drives me crazy
B	thought she might've called today actually
A	oh you now perhaps
B	well I might do in a little while
A	fifteen twenty-nine
B	half past three?
A	nearly half past three dunno if that's right
B	mm
A	cos sometimes it's quick it's funny that one
B	it's more or less right
A	yeah
B	oh is it?
A	fifteen twenty-five by my watch
B	smelling your food cooking making me hungry it's nowhere near dinner time
A	no

B	yeah got plenty of potatoes
A	yeah I I what I do I do some
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	we we don't often have mashed potatoes
B	only takes a couple more minutes to mash them from boiled really doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	got butter in
A	he I bet he won't eat his chicken
B	what
A	yeah he's a git for leaving it
B	oh why does he leave the chicken?
A	dunno
B	raw food?
A	he not
B	could eat it a bit of the chicken nugget
A	if you say to him if you don't eat that chicken you're not going like I do
B	mm
A	and then you go to town on it
B	mm
A	and if you leave him here he'll do his phone
B	he yeah he's distracted
A	I done a spicy shepherd's pie once and
B	put er turmeric and chilli in it last time
A	yeah loved it
B	mm
A	even
B	mm
A	he sat here
B	distracted the whole time
A	and and just
B	no
A	but I do cos he eats all his grub
B	well
A	yeah well he he eats it better
B	I dunno why
A	because it makes him laugh and it's
B	I don't see how they're just talking about a poxy computer game
A	see now there's only five runners
B	five another one's gone
A	out out of six of them so now that's crapped it right up
B	what time's that race?

A	cos the prize money ain't be
B	mm
A	and then
B	oh
A	now we just see how it goes
B	they've got time to do stuff there
A	yeah
B	so is it the trainers that decide to pull out the horses?
A	yeah
B	oh does it?
A	two hundred and thirty people's had a bet on it
B	mm
A	which in my case will be worth doing
B	two hundred and thirty people isn't that many for
B	to be betting on on a race?
A	probably had a lot of people abandon it I mean weather's
B	yes the weather's bad
A	who's gonna stand at the race course when it's like this?
B	yeah no one
A	well it's all done it's all pre-planned innit?
B	mm
A	I mean if it didn't the race courses would shut down around the country and there'd be a lot of people out of work
B	mm
A	although when the when the horses go over the jumps and they land
B	mm
A	they're all
B	mm
A	yeah
B	it's because people like
A	yeah
B	probably pay them less than minimum wage to do that job
A	yeah
B	I know really nice really it's making me hungry
A	what about a cup of tea and couple of biscuits?
B	yeah I suppose we could do that can't we?

B	yeah
A	now it's all chemicals processed
B	oh yeah
A	it's
B	no
A	they're frozen on the way over
B	yeah
A	whatever and then kept in
B	everything's imported
A	yeah yeah
A	is when I go out to the farm and buy them off the farm
B	oh yeah

A	yeah
B	don't know how good those you don't know if there's actually any vitamins left in it any more
A	no
B	cos it's travelled so far
A	they don't
B	there's a thing they do to apples now
A	yeah
B	and then you go and bite into it it's got no flavour it turns to powder in your mouth
A	and look at the stuff they spray in in with the steam now to keep it
B	no pesticide oh yeah yeah still a bit moist in there
A	that's that's all it is
B	shiny
A	and when they
B	start rotting
A	that's what you want is grow your own
B	but you need a nice bit of land land land's too expensive yes
A	that garden ain't no good for grain
B	yes
A	it's got a shingle underneath there
B	no it's not very big anyway I suppose for you and mum it might be alright
B	land has gone too expensive
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	some runner beans
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you can't afford to buy it
A	it's like you go to France you can have a horse steak there's nothing wrong with that
B	yeah
A	the trouble is
B	that you're now eating
A	and now you're eating it
B	it's not just horses cows too
A	oh yeah
B	chickens
A	yeah yeah
B	probably pigs
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
A	and she said well nan never used to eat that many vegetables and that and I said yeah but nan never
B	yeah
A	I think the only processed meat
B	it's not the same
A	when we was young was a tin of spam or corned beef
B	or corned beef exactly
A	that was it
B	now you got everything in your freezer everything
A	but I don't eat I've never ate it anyway
B	even when you buy like you said a steak from the shops you don't
A	yeah
B	know what that
A	no
B	cow's been treated with
A	no
B	now you don't eat any frozen stuff there's barely anything in your freezer
A	I don't eat
B	no
B	it's not really meat that's why
A	no
B	oh
A	and the other six days a week it's fish
B	fish
A	and whatever we had like today that's it
B	oh that's certainly healthier I think
A	yeah
B	you don't know how radioactive
A	well
B	just gotta take your chances with some things haven't you?
A	well you have yeah
B	got this far I suppose dad
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah we'll do that darling

B	then you have to
A	oh well

A	yeah
B	we won't earn that much
A	well mum is
B	yeah I think it's ten yeah
A	before

A	I
B	so
A	another
B	so if we

B	on the side you've given me some
A	jesus christ

B	yeah
A	yeah
B	doesn't like the m =
A	yeah
B	she likes the actual caring part though
A	yeah
B	it's a real shame cos if they just employed two more people every day
A	when you go into
B	her job would be significantly improved
A	then you you go in there's supposed to four people there
A	so you're doubling up
B	residents
A	yeah it's ridiculous
B	absurd
A	you're doubling up
B	no
A	no it's bad
B	no tea break no dinner break
A	yeah
B	and that's the way they bloody do it
A	but it goes on all the time
B	oh I bet it does too
A	not only there everywhere
B	I know every every job
A	yeah
B	and makes everyone work more than they should
A	and if you complain they sack you
B	yeah
A	or they make it awkward for you
B	make you feel bad when you go in
A	it's like when I I
B	mm
B	no
A	and er it er this is when he phoned me up and I
B	yeah
A	and the next thing I knew erm
B	oh can they give you different amounts
A	yeah
B	according to how much they think you need?
A	and then when he and they
B	oh really? good
A	yeah
B	yeah it's worthwhile
A	so I'll get
B	okay
A	yeah
B	with the bills and everything
A	yeah
B	still if you were on your own that wouldn't be enough to take care of you would it?
A	no
B	it's
A	no
B	not really that much money
A	no
B	but
A	but then I wanna give it another year
B	yeah and see what else
B	yeah
A	because the
B	oh I mean really they should you should get that amount of money just in your pension
A	he erm
B	if they weren't so tight
A	he's got a car out of them
B	mm
A	pay for the car
B	get a
A	get a really
B	oh they help you out with things like buying a car and stuff?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but if you wanted a better model then you'd pay
B	why do they do that then? why do they not with your car so you've got a
B	why
A	yeah
B	do they help out with cars? just so you?
A	well disability
B	yeah
A	that's what you're entitled to
B	to spend
A	yeah
A	and
B	mobile
A	yeah what they drive round
B	what oh you mean the scooter type things?
A	yeah
A	yeah get one of them
B	no don't need one of them
A	no I'm just saying you know?
B	you can do
A	they all they all push their luck
B	oh
A	they're all they're all jumping on the bandwagon
B	I wouldn't
A	no I wouldn't
B	for a start
A	yeah well I mean it's
A	they're alright in the
B	not really necessarily they well I mean if you're
A	some people need them
B	but if you are disabled it
A	yeah yeah
B	because if you can't afford a car
A	no
B	more cos you've got old and your legs
A	yeah
B	have got arthritis then
A	well I mean I just said
B	as you said if you've worked your entire life never had any sick pay
A	I've never claimed a sick pay in in my life
B	I know
A	yeah
B	money and taxes your entire life
A	yeah
B	mm disgraceful
A	and then when I send the physio
A	yeah
B	have to ask for one?
A	yeah we had it
A	oh yeah we just couldn't find it
B	and we just couldn't find it
A	mum put it away somewhere
B	mm
A	otherwise we'd've just been
B	mm
A	and you know that on my pension I mean no
B	boils much much quicker yeah
A	ready to mash
B	much much quicker we do the same
A	yeah
B	not boiled I know yeah
A	yeah
B	everyone on the internet says
A	yeah
B	I've never tried it but
A	I I always do them like this
B	I don't eat don't eat
A	well we don't but well only when I do shepherd's pie and that
B	shepherd's pie oh
A	and I thought it it'd be different just to rather than chuck them in there like you know
B	yeah
A	just lay them on like that
B	I prefer
A	I'll try it I've never done it this way before but
B	that sounds like a good idea
A	that looks a bit green that one that one's a bit bloody
B	it's just a bit raw not really ready or something yeah
A	yeah
B	got another big bag here
A	yeah
B	are these actually British then?
A	oh I
B	says it on there
A	well they're probably bagged in
B	bagged in here
A	and come from a foreign land
B	yeah
A	yeah well I mean
B	quality assured assured food standards
A	it doesn't say they've grown here does it?
B	I mean it says British white potatoes
A	yeah
B	which is fine
A	oh yeah
B	but it doesn't actually
A	that's probably where they're bagged
B	no that'd be where they're bagged yeah
A	that's the trouble
B	it's hard to know
A	yeah
B	so I don't really know if that's true or not it doesn't
A	the er
B	when's your
B	oh right see if the horses are running at all
A	if it ain't on then it's on the
B	have you got is this your?
A	what what's that say?
