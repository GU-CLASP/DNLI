A	I think you've grown yet again what are you? seven foot six?
B	it's great in here
A	it's good isn't it?
B	it's really good
A	and er you should have seen the roses they were just absolutely profuse and wonderful but it's still it's in a good state and we've had some rain in the back one
B	it's really nice
A	but really that's very nice even though it's just
B	I walked past erm
A	leave the door er with with the
B	and their front garden's horrible

A	let's make some tea or erm you drink tea don't you
B	er yeah I do
C	oh just
A	I said to
B	it's so green and
A	isn't it great?
C	yeah
A	I know
A	but you know it's very difficult to get a pretty garden seat which is also comfortable that's
B	when did you get all these plants?
A	over the last two years
B	oh they just grew you didn't buy them? they popped out?
A	well no I had to buy them bit by
A	bit and put them in
A	I mean the problem with pots is that it needs a huge amount of watering
C	well no I'm just not eating
A	or she doesn't eat wheat and B you have a girlfriend who's a proper cake maker and I thought what have I done?
B	oh did have some cakes to bring but I've left them
A	no
C	what cakes were they?
B	they were I mean they were quite sophisticated I mean I didn't really like them that much but
C	where?
A	what she made them?
B	yeah they're like polenta mix
C	oh I see that's like that's not wheat polenta's not wheat
B	yeah
C	is it?
A	oh
A	very annoying of you
C	go go away
A	cos I mean cos
B	you can have them later they they're in
C	yay
A	polenta er lemon cake is absolutely delicious
B	well I can't remember what's in it I think like rhubarb or something
A	oh alright well bring her bring
B	yeah
A	so I don't think this is really terrible special certainly not in your terms your terms now so
B	yeah
A	so well it was only five minutes ago that you went
A	I don't understand it
C	yeah it's true
A	isn't it isn't it weird? erm
B	yeah
A	do you know how you've done?
B	yeah I did alright
C	you did really well
B	yeah I did well
A	yes I'm sure I
B	could have I could have done better though that's
A	you could have done better? could you
A	I'm surprised and shocked
C	what well why didn't you then?
A	why didn't you?
B	oh cos I just got I got like erm
C	oh
A	oh right
C	yeah yeah
B	nothing I actually really prepared came up
A	oh that's really annoying
C	right
A	isn't it?
C	that is annoying
A	you had that in one or two didn't you
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	I mean I suppose that's a major
B	it was like I mean
A	oh yeah
B	in the other paper they had four questions and they all had the word moral in the title
C	oh that happened to me where they were all so similar yes but but
B	no I mean it's I can't be bothered it's not I'm sure
C	well you still did well
B	yeah
A	but I expect you have a view on what moral means
B	yeah I know but it was
C	mm
B	I was convinced it was gonna be about something else
C	oh right yeah yeah yeah
B	cos I thought they were meant to reflect what they focus on in lectures which are sort of women and stuff cos there's two women lecturers
C	yeah but if they do that or they like
B	or they don't
C	it really does piss you about that
B	yeah
A	but so you've actually had the results
B	yeah
A	already? and what are they?
B	I got sixty-nine overall
B	yeah
A	you'll have to work harder to get your first
B	well it's only one more point
A	I know but it's significant isn't it?
C	why
B	yeah
A	because you told me you're not aiming for a first
C	no I'm not aiming for a first mm
A	you all work hard and you
B	but also I mean I had
C	yeah right
B	I had one paper that was like fifty-seven so that
C	oh
B	to I mean and I had other stuff that was like I had an eighty
A	right
C	oh that's good
A	I'll tell you what it's nice to know that
A	you know you you you can't get a higher grade if you're anywhere but
C	wait
A	what?
C	are you calling
A	no I mean you can't get a grade you know a good grade
C	mm
A	he's got a good grade
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	a very good oh yeah
B	I mean I think only about eight eight people normally get a first not
A	yes er I mean it's
C	well they have to have it like that don't they?
A	not in my view that it makes any difference to one's life
B	yeah more people get it in the third year than the second year
A	do they?
C	oh right
B	second year's
A	what they're doing you see what they're doing with you I can tell you that for so giving you sixty-nine is saying watch it
B	they they're not doing that
A	you know erm you think you're clever but we would like you to really pull the stops out so
B	I don't know it's actually cos of the second year you you have less choice of what you can do so you have to do stuff
C	oh yeah
B	yeah I think so
A	do you and
B	and it's so broad that you have to do
A	and do you have to choose thesis for your last year?
B	you don't have to but I probably will
A	right and what will it be?
B	I dunno that's what I'm trying to work out at the moment
C	moral something
A	well I'm er very glad that you somebody's learning about morals
B	well the whole point there is no morals in the end
A	that's what I suspected you might think
B	yeah I can do some help
A	it's good isn't it her subject?
B	yeah it's interesting
A	right now you only want the chocolate bit at the top is that correct
C	yes erm
A	she says she's not fussy she doesn't eat rice she doesn't eat fish she doesn't eat
C	I had rice yesterday
A	oh congratulations
C	yeah and I I made rice yesterday
A	very good
C	mum told
A	I will have the bit of cake that you don't eat of that
C	oh

A	while you're here
C	mm uhu
A	so he er oh that's rather weak

A	did you? where did you go?
B	erm I went to
A	oh yes
B	it's should you should it's so it's it's cool there basically and I knew about this thing from reading which is a really secret thing it's called the
A	right
B	or an important person so this is where all the sort of peasants would go to do their asking the oracle and they would throw knuckle bones and dice and things
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	to get their answers er and you can go there and no one really remembers it or knows about it and there's ancient
B	but how amazing

C	really?
B	it's
C	oh wow
A	no
B	you would like it it's

B	because it's sort of it's not it's in like a few things in classical literature and it
C	mm
B	it's not in any really guide books tourist books
C	that's weird
A	but that's really interesting
C	mm
A	you wouldn't have thought there's much that could be discovered anymore would you? I suppose it's just a beaten track people are too lazy to
B	and I'm sure
C	yeah
B	if you google it there's stuff about how to get there and stuff
A	yes
B	I mean I know there is I know there is cos I got the directions but
A	mm
C	oh that sounds good
A	it sounds really good but you know it's
B	it's also like one of the most beautiful walks you've ever been on sort of

B	mount
A	I can remember going to you reminded me then the smell of the smell of honey cos

A	vegetarian meal
B	he's nineteen years old it's not like
A	he's not nineteen is he?

A	but still it's a hard one I mean doesn't your
B	I don't
A	I haven't yet personally met a male adult myself
C	no I haven't either
A	of any
A	any age
A	of nineteen

C	you just moved it in
C	and he came back and it was like
B	I carried his bed to the shed that took about two hours
B	which
C	yeah you think you're doing him a favour but he just thought he's been like
A	I mean he feels that he's being shut away in a shed is what he feels
C	oh I I'd be quite happy with the shed
B	it's really
C	I it's nice when you've got the garden and you're next to the kitchen
B	nice view and there's a toilet just there
A	he can use the kitchen
C	you've got like
A	can he?
B	of course he can
C	like a kettle

C	so imagine
A	but he just goes to bed or is on
B	yeah
A	his own in the shed
C	yeah
A	okay so that's not terrible

A	yes well most people with mobiles don't answer I think it's
B	I never answer the phone
C	no but if if you've got
A	incredibly irritating
C	or like unknown number I kind of tend to avoid those cos
A	yes I suppose so
C	or like a
A	yes oh right well I don't use my mobile
C	mm
A	mm are phones getting out of fashion to have mobiles now and people
C	well what do you have?
B	I don't have one

C	but that's not on purpose
B	yeah it's not really on purpose

C	oh the wi-fi yeah
A	well maybe it'll all stop all this
B	no I doubt it
C	well I've got rid of Facebook
A	did you?
C	ages ago
A	why's that? because you think you're getting
C	don't need it
B	no I'm full
C	I don't like it either
A	do you not?
C	no
B	yeah it's pretty useless
A	I must say I don't understand it
C	I just have Instagram
A	everybody would know knowing my business
C	yeah but you knew what
A	I knew what
A	in a sentence
A	but obviously something with a title like Grindr you know that they're up to no good
C	yeah but I
A	yes
C	of course I know
C	oh right okay fair enough
A	I don't think of all the things that the terrible things there are
A	I mean all these things that people do that is
C	mm
A	and meeting strangers all that that is just beyond me
C	yeah
A	something else in the bottom of my cup?
C	no it smells funny
A	can you smell it?
C	mm
A	it smells alright to me
C	mm
A	ask
C	I was gonna drink it
A	so what else? erm how about friends at
B	yeah kind of
A	that's been a bit of a disappointment hasn't it?
B	not well I mean not really cos I'm not really like
A	they're not soulmates
B	calibre
A	they're not of great calibre
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm kind of surprised
B	I'm not actually when you think about it
C	no
A	what do you mean exactly?
B	erm I think it's not it's not
A	no of course it's not
B	and it's not even even the ones that might be are sort of erm there's a lot there's a big sort of everybody is quite
C	mm yeah
B	and even if they're not they try to
A	they're all middle class
B	to be like
A	straight? middle class?
B	no like upper
A	oh really?
B	sort of
A	posh?
B	or to be a certain way in
C	posher
B	like to be friends to do what is the status quo to do
C	mm
B	which sort of I think stops people being sort of a bit more interesting than they might be otherwise
C	mm
B	I mean there's all sorts of things like it doesn't happen in my college but every other college there's lots of drinking societies and that and if you're not I've got one friend who isn't in one in her college and is just sort of
C	mm
B	ostracised so you have to be in one of these
C	really? oh my god
B	archaic sort of perverse
C	that's
B	outdated clubs where you sort of binge drink and get humiliated in order to be have a social life it's that kind of thing goes on
C	is the
C	yeah
B	like there's
C	yeah
B	in some colleges there'll be like six or seven so and like the last two like no-one wants to be in them but it's just sort of so everybody can be in one
C	oh right okay
B	the people make
C	so are are you in one though?
B	there's none in
C	oh okay
B	there isn't any
C	oh that's good
B	so people in
C	mm
B	partly because of that
C	mm
A	how interesting
A	so people want really they just abide by tradition?
B	well yeah and I mean if you think about it I guess that lots of people turn up there and they're like eighteen and they're shy and they wanna make friends and that everybody's been telling them for the last five years that this is gonna be the best time of their life
A	yes
C	yeah
B	therefore they'll be like
C	but all universities are like that
B	yeah I know but then
C	oh really?
B	so excited to be in like pleased with themselves
C	included yeah
B	to be invited that they're willing to sort of do
C	oh
A	yes what are they?
B	there's like all
C	oh really?
B	or like weird things like you have to like
C	oh
B	like jelly wrestler sex
C	oh my god
A	no
B	yeah and there's lots of problems cos there's basically it's quite sometimes like people have managed to like get they have like group chats on Facebook where they talk about their
C	oh yeah
B	their antics
C	oh
B	and they do
C	really?
A	they don't
B	they do there's this one curry restaurant where you go there and you
C	mm
B	is like the the liecense to sort of make a mess and trash it
C	what?
A	and these this is the cream of our
A	er educated society
B	obviously and and I mean you can avoid all that but
C	do you think that's mostly like the public the public school people or is it a mix of
B	I mean probably
A	it sounds sounds very public school
B	yeah I mean that's where
C	mm
B	they come from and then
C	yeah
B	people wanna be aspire to be like
C	mm
B	the people who are popular and in the clubs
C	yeah
B	and the sports teams
A	I'm sorry to hear this because I mean you know obviously
C	mm
A	a curry house
C	yeah
A	that doesn't seem to me to be quite the highest
C	no
A	level to aspire to in in this life
C	uhu
A	you know what the problem is? the problem is there's no National Service anymore
C	do you think?
B	yeah
A	I'll I'll bring it in and I would have it probably for boys between sixteen and eighteen for a year
C	uhu
A	and for girls maybe for six months and they'd all have to live together and it would be very disciplined but they wouldn't have to fight
B	but why
A	they would do things in the city
B	does doesn't have to be an army
A	you know clean the streets
B	yeah it doesn't be a doesn't
A	no they just they have to do social things
C	well that's what David Cameron was trying to do
C	so are you gonna run for Tory prime minister or
A	no because I'm
B	what's that
A	it'll never happen because
B	well you can only
A	people will take it will think that it's you know
B	you can
A	getting rid of their privileges and freedoms
C	mm absolutely
A	but but the problem is you know young people have boys have testosterone and girls go wild
A	and erm you know it it's it's difficult
C	erm you know who voted for who who voted Tory?
A	who?
C	grandad
B	he actually
A	what my my grandad did he?
C	your grandad?
A	not my grandad but my
C	yeah
A	well he's going senile I'm told
C	for the first time in his life yeah he's going senile
B	why did he?
C	erm cos he didn't wanna vote for Labour even though he's always been a really strong Labour supporter
B	well why did he just not vote for someone else like Green or something?
C	yeah I don't know
A	I didn't vote for Labour either this time for the first time
C	yeah
B	who did you vote for?
C	Lib Dems
A	but I was pathetic I just didn't I didn't know who to vote for I just thought
C	I tried to tell you
A	well voting for the Greens is a waste of time what I like about the theory of
C	well
A	Lim Deb Lib Dems is that you know that they should be a balancing act but I think no
C	yeah but that's I think that's like a stupid
A	well I don't know what to do now I really
C	er did you not see their advert about look look left look right and then cross?
B	oh my days that was so funny
C	it was so cringe
A	none none of them are
C	the basically their argument was like
A	none of them are inspiring
C	the other two are bad so you might as well vote for us like
B	who who won this seat?
A	this is strong Labour er stronghold
C	mm
A	no thanks to me no exactly no exactly
A	I mean you know still compared to the rest of the world we're in a relatively good state aren't we? so far
C	mm
A	no doubt about that you're very lucky
C	we are fine it's just that all the
B	except people under thirty
C	the youth yeah it's just all of us so
A	but you're fine too because you know
C	so look after the inheritance for me cos
A	you're both you're both highly educated you're both loved a lot you're privileged if yes it's gonna be much more difficult for you in many many ways than for my
C	mm
A	there's no doubt about that but if you came from a you know a different kind of family you'd have no support you do have a lot of support
C	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	I probably
A	I mean I'm not going to allow you to starve although a week or two I might consider wouldn't hurt
C	a week or two what?
B	starving
C	oh
A	I mean none of us
C	mm
A	know what it is to go hungry
C	mm
B	I went I went quite hungry in America and Berlin
A	I I don't suppose it was very nice
B	er yeah it wasn't really but like
A	but you did know in the end but you were somehow in control it wasn't as though you thought oh god you know that's it I'm never gonna be able to get any food again
B	yeah
A	it's not quite the same
B	but anyone can say that you can always sort of find around like outside supermarkets
B	in bins and stuff
C	oh yeah
A	yes
C	skipping
B	I mean it's not
C	my friends do that
A	there's a big difference between people who come from families when they're or broken families with no money and impoverished children of middle classes
C	yeah but they do get more well meant to get more support from the government
B	not anymore
C	they do at university
A	not anymore
C	but yeah
A	no
C	not
A	well it is I mean there is no doubt that that it's difficult for you lot
C	mm yeah
A	I thought what I might do in my will is to divide some of my
C	don't you have to put that all away so it doesn't get taxed?
A	I have to put it down on paper which is a drag erm but I'm thinking of doing it you know so that one of you can have the sixties work one of you can have the eighties er I can pick out certain erm
C	I'll take sixties
A	will you now? oh alright
A	one erm and I'll be sitting on a cloud watching
A	but seventies no I've
C	okay so
A	a fair sum eighties
A	might get some money but the recent stuff
B	I like the recent stuff yeah yeah
C	mm
A	I mean maybe the recent stuff should go to
C	mm
A	so I
C	oh
A	one of these days
C	mm
B	I think everybody should not live in England I reckon
C	where would you live instead?
B	almost anywhere like
B	it's
C	Greece?
B	yeah Greece Portugal American
C	Syria?
A	do you have any idea what you might to do
B	erm no
A	oh
C	well are you gonna do a master's?
B	well erm
C	mm
A	is a master's one year or two?
C	one
B	I've already got a master's actually when I finish
C	oh yeah
A	that's yeah well so do I so
B	yeah you get
A	oh it's automatically if you you can
B	yeah but it's
C	no but but the thing is yours will have like what is it?
C	fifty basically how it works is if you're a
B	I dunno I I've never heard about this actually
C	it's like fifty pounds and then your BA matures into a master's
A	is that so?
C	yeah but it will have letters after it saying like
A	I see and you can't if you don't pay your fifty pounds?
C	is what that's what I've been told
A	that's a good wheeze isn't it?
C	one of my
C	professors told me
A	that's very clever of them
C	I know but mine will say MA
A	yes well it would be no if you do a master's anybody could do a PhD I mean if you're clever you
C	oh yeah
A	until you're forty-five
C	mm exactly
A	erm
C	although my friend's got a year left to his PhD and he's like twenty-eight
A	right
B	yeah but what before his funding runs out?
C	no a year to a year left to do it cos he had erm I think he had to do his over four or five years
A	well I I
C	and if you got funding
A	the I've heard now that in art schools they're considering not employing anybody to teach unless they have a PhD
C	the they do yeah but they do that mostly anyway
A	I know but you can understand it with you know with
C	oh yes yeah
A	mathematics or you know geology or
C	mm
A	something where you I mean I I'm perfectly happy for my dentist or my doctor to have had a lot of years' education but
C	yeah
A	an artist? it's ridiculous
C	but erm at
A	yes
C	it's more financially viable
A	yeah
C	how can you teach art in a lecture?
A	you can't
B	it's cos they don't understand because all universities have been turned into businesses
C	exactly
A	that's true
B	so there's no
C	yeah exactly
B	no there's no sort of understanding or sympathy it's just well this is not it doesn't make sense economically so we should do this
C	yeah exactly
A	it's
B	but it that's because of money as well
C	yeah
B	it's
C	yeah
A	well of course it may it'll change because everything does change all the time but it doesn't go back
C	well it's not gonna change in the next five years
B	no not yet
A	well it may change
B	or the next twenty years
A	when
B	they've got their claws in it now
C	and then Boris Johnson will be prime minister
A	it's not impossible
C	no it's definitely like that cos he's not erm he's not running for mayor London mayor so he can be an MP
A	yeah he's
C	erm
A	pretty crafty
C	yeah he is quite
A	I saw him in the street once I was standing erm waiting for somebody at the back of the Royal Academy and he came walking along and
C	oh did he?
A	and of course I looked at him as you as you do and
C	mm
A	as as he walked past and saw me looking at him he went
C	oh did he?
A	acknowledging me as a member of the public
C	well you know
A	does he?
C	yeah
A	and what does he say about him?
C	he's he's like he's nice enough he's friendly but he said he doesn't like to look at him too close cos he makes him feel sick
C	but
C	so apparently
A	well he wouldn't
C	his face up close is like really
A	he's not a beauty
C	no
A	no he's not a beauty
A	but I don't suppose that well it has something to do with
C	mm
A	the only prime minister with no hair was William I've forgotten his second name now and he only lasted five minutes
C	mm
A	the fact that you're successful as a politician according to how much hair you have
C	do you think? I'm trying to think of someone
A	I I wouldn't be surprised if it was something that's completely absurd and ridiculous
B	well I heard a like well there's something like tnot only thathere's a weird statistic about how like seventy-five percent of American CEOs are over six foot four or something
C	oh really?
A	of er American what?
B	CEOs are over six foot four or something
A	is that right?
A	yeah
B	cos it inspires confidence in
A	that that's right they have to be able to erm
C	yeah
A	threaten people
C	true is this still hot?
A	do you want me to put the kettle on?
C	please

B	bloody hell
A	look you can put it I here in the in the microwave for ten seconds

C	ah have you got a frame for this then?
A	yes
C	it looks good
A	it looks good doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	and er I have to find a nail to hang it on

A	I thought maybe there's a little space there
C	oh underneath the light?
A	yes
C	next to the the
C	oh oh on okay oh yeah
C	oh yeah
A	could be quite nice couldn't it?
B	mm mm
A	er I thought that at the beginning of August I'll email
C	okay
A	cos I and I haven't I do get a bit edgy when I think about it
C	well we need to organise train or maybe we don't need to organise train until
A	we we have to
C	no we have to organise accomodation in if we're going to Krakow and then Warsaw
A	yes
C	whichever way round we need to organise that
A	exactly the but also apparently they don't have the euro and you have to get zlotys
C	do they not?
A	they are they are in the EU but somebody said they thought that they still have zlotys so
C	I didn't spend money when I went so I'm not sure
A	yeah
C	does Poland
A	yeah good
C	I never like go to a
A	yeah well I can go to the post office here and and get it
C	oh it does have zlotys yeah you're right
A	does it? you see?
C	yeah
A	so I'll
C	no wait nevertheless erm establishments as notably hypermarkets I'm not sure what that is accept payments in euros but
A	right well
C	that's
A	take zlotys I don't care for I'll use a bit here and there we and the whole thing's not
C	yeah but
A	when we arrive there

C	I'm er
A	do the party and then there'll be a nearly a month to
C	mm mm
A	organise that and I
C	mm
A	I think that's just the attitude we have to take
C	oh but you really like to know what we're doing especially if we're in Poland
A	well what's the worst that can happen that we sleep on the side of the road?
C	uhu
A	I don't want that I must admit
C	mm
A	and of course when we go to Krakow and erm Warsaw even if it's for half a day each we won't nobody speaks English there
C	no well especially not the first place we're going to
C	are you sure you don't wanna take a trip to
A	what's that Auschwitz? no?
C	no?
A	I do most certainly not
C	mm

A	you've ever had
C	no looking at it is making me feel very sick
A	I'll tell you what it shows how much sugary stuff they put in those erm juices
C	no they don't put sugar in
A	they put sweetener in some sort of
C	not in a smoothie like not not if you buy
A	they do
C	like Innocent smoothies it's just fruit
A	I don't believe it
B	it's just good better quality fruit than
C	yeah
B	that does taste of anything because it's basically
A	it's not right
B	synthetic
C	and it's melon
A	yes what?
C	it's melon like melon has no flavour and grape
A	grape has no flavour that's true but melon does a good melon

C	oh
C	yeah we used to sing that at school
B	mm
C	yeah we used to sing that
C	at
B	I never heard of that before
C	weird
A	I think that your grandfather and I used to sing that together with your your various mothers
C	mm
A	that's money for
B	how many people is she making fish pie for?
A	well that's why I do actually need to know I'm I really would like to keep it under twenty and a lot of people I ask couldn't come
C	oh
A	but and then I thought well I could do we could eat standing up it would make it easier but of course it's not so nice eating standing up so I'm gonna try and see
C	not really fish pie
A	remember last time we were about sixteen or seventeen people this is gonna be I think twenty probably
C	I wasn't here last time
A	you weren't here but
B	was I?
A	yeah they were it wasn't last year it was the year before
B	can't remember
A	but I think I will you know we'll just try and manage on the er table but I
C	who is it who's coming?
A	I've forgotten
C	oh
C	okay
C	oh I like
A	cos they're in France I know
C	and
A	so do I I mean where they are there's always a party
C	yeah
A	erm
C	mm
A	I've written seven till eleven
C	not
A	I didn't ask
C	good
A	oh
C	oh yeah I like them
A	with
C	is it really her first night?
A	well
C	cos the baby's not that young
A	no and I
A	don't think they've been out at night
C	no
A	erm
C	oh but it would be nice if she brought the baby the baby's fine
B	but babies are so annoying
A	oh
C	annoying? no this baby's not annoying
A	it's a lovely baby but I don't think the
C	oh okay
A	at a at a party
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	I don't mind when when my friends come with babies when they come I won't smoke
C	put her in the basement
A	well she's decided she wants she said you know she'd like to have a little bit of adult conversation
C	mm it's fair enough yeah
A	and is said well that's unlikely you'll find that here
C	mm
A	who else? I'm not asking a single professional person who can do me any good whatsoever so it's just friends and family
C	oh yeah that's fine
A	yes it's fine
C	I think
A	and
C	oh what pudding is she gonna make?
A	she'll probably make a tiramisù
C	uhu
A	and
C	okay so I'll
A	and I will make a pudding
C	I'll go to the Co-op and get myself a microwave meal
A	I think you'll have to do that darling I you know cos
C	yeah no what's the point of coming?
A	well you don't come for the food
C	oh no absolutely
B	but there'll be things for the fish pie like potatoes or like will there?
A	well no but
C	no but it's
A	the potatoes er is
C	on top
A	and then I just thought we'd have beans with it
C	but I could eat fish the fish pie if it didn't have shellfish in it
A	well I I'm leaving it to her to do it and it has to have what what can I make you then that's not difficult?
B	frozen pizza
C	it's not
A	look
C	okay
A	I think that's all I can do
C	but I'm not gonna cook it it's just gonna be microwave thing
A	a
C	okay
A	well there'll be some nice beans
C	uhu
B	why just have like crisps or something
A	I don't wanna have crisps because then you then they crunch underfoot all the time
C	mm crunch underfoot you've got a few bits underfoot down there
C	as well
A	there's always some bits there I don't know who sits in this er seat and drops their food
A	oh what?
C	erm er the other night we heard this like little like yapping and then I went onto the balcony and outside there's a building site which is empty and there were two little tiny fox cubs playing with each other
A	oh no
C	and they were like snuggling next to each other and like
A	oh how you lucky thing
C	really cute it was really cute I tried to take photos but it was too dark
A	right I would have loved that they don't come in here
C	it was really
A	because they can't get up the wall
C	well they can't get in
A	no
C	mm you could do a little cat flap and then put a raw egg on one side but then you'd have
A	cat flap through the wall? imagine what I'd get through that
C	mm
C	yeah
A	I I don't think that would be good I do get birds
C	mm
A	now I've got a a nice little bird trough there
C	mm but it looks empty
A	no it's it's got water in
C	oh
A	and they do come I saw it was rather interesting when when we had like those really hot days and I had a blackbird and it came and sat on the bench and first of all it stood with its beak open to the sun
C	erm granny I was actually here
A	you were here?
C	when that happened
A	so you were
B	er
A	and er
B	was actually the blackbird
A	and then then it turned its back and opened all its wings out
C	mm
A	and its tail and apparently they do this
C	yeah it was good
A	somebody told me
C	oh really?
A	they do it to absorb the sun
C	oh
A	on on the feathers and so on on the body
C	that is weird
B	I saw something quite
A	no
C	really?
B	they were making a sort of massive racket and then
C	mm
B	sort of fifty or sixty crows flying after this kestrel and like dive bombing it and pulling pecking it
A	oh how awful
C	oh
B	I know and then like
A	nature's hideous
B	I know and then it was sort of flying really quite low and all the crows were just like
C	crows are horrible
B	and then eventually it kind of got really tired and sat on a on a
A	no
B	I watched it for like an hour bit it's and all and then the worst bit was this little magpie that got involved
A	oh
C	what and joined the crows?
B	joined the crows and sort of pecking
C	oh
A	is that right?
B	yeah
A	that's really bizarre
B	quite little but like sort of when a when like a big it's like little kids fooling fooling around with big bullies
C	mm oh
A	oh nature is absolutely beastly
C	why didn't he run to the front?
B	cos they couldn't
A	no no
B	the you know where those houses sort of
C	oh
B	erm those houses like just before estate where the playground there's like a street
C	yeah
B	it's it was like in a garden there so you couldn't sort of get rid of the crows but also the crows would have just pecked like gone and pecked you
C	do you reckon?
B	so I was looking
C	like
