A	uh yeah so your favourite film is it uh uh
B	I like a bit of Doris
A	ye ha
B	um
A	yeah you've definitely got that from from that
B	she likes
A	you mean like uh culturally speaking
B	like E
A	you've picked up the meme of watching films
B	well I mean I I don't I'm not a big film lover I don't go to the cinema
A	I don't know if you I don't know if it's genetic I don't know if you've inherited the film loving gene or if it's a culture
B	no but I mean I I don't go to the cinema very often for example and and I don't own any films
A	well I've got a few mainly just cos I I got I don't spending loads of money on it so I'd rather have sort of like recordings and yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I do quite like them and I uh watch them if they're on the telly and stuff
A	I really love Back To The Future it's one my favourites yeah
B	my nana used to have like a little cabinet and she would like
A	oh Land Before Time
B	um
A	that was
B	uh ET
A	oh well that's a Spielberg that is isn't it?
B	little Shop Of Horrors like
A	oh yeah that that's a lot uh
B	um Ghostbusters Ghostbusters Two my personal favourite
A	A lot of eighties eighties things
B	Ghostbusters Two
A	um
B	and Ghostbusters obviously
B	bit of Igon Spengler
A	oh yeah yeah yeah that's a  that's a  good one like
B	captain Hook
A	they did  they did  them sort of bad jokes about that  about that  fat kid didn't they who used to get into like roll
B	yeah
B	and like um
A	he may oh I just like I was thinking because of his sort of size like
B	yeah but he was only a bairn then though
A	that wasn't  that wasn't  sustainable
B	um Captain Hook
A	I know it was uh that made  that made  like the truffle shuffle even like worse to sort of laugh at like
B	I know
A	you can't laugh at child
B	obesity
A	obesity can you?
B	well it's not his fault really is it it's his parents
A	that's what I'm gonna say
B	yeah and Captain Hook
A	oh that was really uh
B	yeah you know what I mean
A	that's
B	so
A	well we've got something similar I mean I've got all my videos
B	but it had like a door and she used it like much like you have
A	oh yeah like I've got I mean double play like eight hours  eight hours  like so you can get four films on one tape
B	yeah my nana did yeah yeah
A	two hours each
B	um and I used to like you know really used to like sort of The Neverending Story and
A	oh yeah I never watched that actually the um
B	land Before Time
A	never watched it but
B	watership Down and
A	there was a trip at school like to the cinema
B	yeah
A	um and I I was excited cos my parents didn't take me to the cinema and I'd never been to the cinema before
B	oh really? No mine didn't really
A	uh so I'd never been to the cinema before like not not ever and I don't think and
B	I remember
A	think that was my first ever trip uh that the school took
B	yeah
A	like got to see like like a PG rated film
B	yeah
A	um and the younger um including me went to see a U rated film which happened to be Land Before Time
B	oh that's a good one
A	I think but but I think actually that was the better of the two like the the PG one was called Mac And Me
B	oh right
A	uh this would've been like nineteen eighty-nine or nineteen ninety
B	yeah yeah
A	nineteen eighty or ninety-two or something but uh yeah I think we  I think we  did better to get
B	land Before Time was a good one
A	wait wait a minute no it was it would be younger than oh I can't remember
B	well
A	I've really really bad memory of my uh childhood to be honest uh
B	well it was a long time ago way
A	it's just black it's just blacked out like
B	no
A	uh
B	I remember my nana and granddad my nana and granddad took us to the pictures once and like me and my nana wanted to see one film and my granddad and our Tom wanted to see another film so we went to see different ones and I remember thinking that was really like really good because like usually it would just be like with my dad or with my mam so you couldn't split it up and like I'd have to sit through like
B	transformer
A	Steven Steven Seagal oh yeah yeah
B	but like me and my nana went to see Little Women and my nana was like it's amazing and I was like
A	what is that?
B	little Women? Come on
A	what is that?
B	it's a book like you've read the have you maybe you haven't it's more of a girls' book
A	it sounds to me like I think of uh big men is more up my street than little women
B	yeah
A	I think uh if if something was called Little Women I would would suspect that it might be like a romantic comedy or something
B	yeah it is a bit floppy
A	um no but I I don't romantic comedies
B	it's one of those classics though
A	I think we were talking about them a couple of days ago actually
B	yeah Bridget Jones
A	you're you you
B	no
A	is that what Little Women is? What's it about?
B	well it's a story about some
A	alright
B	uh I don't know
A	oh I think I'm gonna find myself uh slipping slipping into
B	it's like a  it's like a  Jane
B	but anyway it's um
A	I went uh I went for a bit like I got
B	I went on a like a date once to the cinema
A	ha ha
B	and I remember thinking it was the stupidest place to go because like
A	well
B	it's so bad and stupid
A	yeah yeah that's a  that's a  sort of typical
B	was quite a good film actually
A	yeah
B	but it's just like
A	but it is a bit silly actually isn't it cos you basically just sit next to each other
B	you should never go to the cinema with anyone that you like because there's no point
A	people do though don't they they always go looking for like
B	like when we watch films I'm always like hey
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah in Berlin
A	there was next to it was a room called that they called the Multikulti
B	right
A	and they would put they
B	yeah
A	it not only is the best bar in the world but also has like
B	best cinema in the world
A	like a
B	yeah
A	it's about  it's about  allowing people to do
B	yeah
A	and uh and a lot of that doesn't happen in uh in bars and cinemas like you're kind of stuck in like
B	no that's true
A	yeah with a cinema you're kind of stuck there aren't you?
B	Cos like
A	yeah I mean it it's if your mates you would wanna get you and your mates uh quite a few of them and then just watch a
B	yeah
A	problem is like there's a bit of an incentive to yeah getting talking about economics again but uh there's a bit of an incentive in the economy to to to against that you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	what is at? Fifteen? Have we done fifteen?
B	nine
A	oh
B	yeah
A	in terms of the economy
B	well
A	um
B	yeah
A	from spending their time without spending money you know what I mean
B	yeah
A	uh and also in the bar yeah I think you would take the money for the beers and you were allowed to keep a certain share of the profit and clearly that clearly that's cash in hand like I think you're not you're you're unlikely to uh I think
B	yeah pay tax on that and everything
A	I I
B	yeah
A	I think you would
B	well I don't know
A	to uh I just felt like it was like
B	maybe if it's a private institution like maybe it's
A	not taxed
B	something separate but I dunno
A	um
B	yeah
A	bar so
B	well it's probably subsidized anyway
A	it may have some kind of yeah it may have
B	yeah dodgy yeah
A	but I was talking about um you see how like economics is you know like all this sort of profit is great on the one hand but on the other hand like some of the better things sometimes the better things are
B	yeah
A	are not are
B	yeah
A	like uh
B	yeah
A	pass it like you copy it you video it and you pass it round you're your friends and that
B	pass it round yeah
A	that's bad for the economy cos then they're not spending money on that film are they?
B	no
A	you know what I mean so it's it's a bit of a there's a bit of a
B	I tend to do most of my film watching at um Christmas like
A	yeah well we we're very lucky to have we're we're lucky to have like you know your your dad's fondness of DVDs and he buys all these
B	but he buys
A	I see yeah so he gets them quite cheap doesn't he?
B	like he goes to like you know Blockbuster or whatever?
A	I've heard of it
B	and um you know they have like you know they rent out DVDs and well everything um games and that as well but they they rent out like DVDs and stuff and um so once they've been rented out for however long
A	yeah
B	then you can just buy them for like two quid or something
A	yeah I mean
B	they can't sell if it's if it doesn't work you know
A	you know like that uh brings me onto actually uh the Pirate Party a bit actually cos uh
B	yeah
A	it's it's quite big news in Europe in German and like Europe but
B	I've never really heard much about it like
A	but they're quite they've won like a they've won something in um in Germany like the Pirate Party
B	so what are their values like? Pieces of eight?
A	I think they they don't really have any values apart from that you should be able to like
B	plunder?
A	it's to do with getting films like
B	piracy?
A	it's to do with like
A	so they're perhaps have a certain they have an anti-copyright uh agenda
B	but you can't get in like you can't win like something based on just one narrow
A	well no they don't just have one uh I mean essentially they're they're I think there's an element of like um you know an a
B	yeah
A	vibe there that they have as well
B	Cos you can't surely base like a political party on just one like fairly narrow um
A	yes you can uh
B	well like BNP IE other
B	well
A	UKIP is the  is the  sort of the typically might be described as one one issue
B	oh I hate all those
A	one issue party um uh
B	no because and not sticking up for UKIP cos to be fair I think they're absolute donkeys but
A	I'll stick up for the British Empire
B	no but they have like they
A	oh is there any more of that down there?
B	no
A	yeah
B	um it's slightly wider than piracy isn't it?
A	um
B	yeah
A	I don't know I don't
B	he was a student he was from Sheffield I think
A	oh right
B	and he was
A	they they had a thing in
B	oh
A	A peer-to-peer program that um you know some programmers that uh
B	oh it's yours
A	uh could well be my uh
B	your mum?
A	my mum couldn't it?
B	shall I have a look?
A	or it could be O2 even though I've told them to stop texting me
B	it's from your mum
A	uh as long as it's as long as there's
B	okay
A	yeah
B	how are you? Have you been able to get out in the lovely sunshine today? We've had a four mile walk along the canal at
A	yeah um I remember that yeah
B	it was lovely
B	I said about
A	it is sad it's always sad when uh when a dog dies but uh
B	of course
A	but you know this new one uh the
B	it's not a jack russell
A	well it's similar to a jack russell
B	it's a patterjack
A	it's similar to jack russell isn't it?
B	Patterdale terrier and a jack russell crossed apparently
A	oh alright yeah
B	how do I even know this it's your mum's dog?
A	I don't know you know I didn't  I didn't  even
B	and I've got the
A	we could ask actually I can send a text back um
B	we haven't got the rest of the end of the message
A	is it asking exactly uh
B	I like quite like the spaniels
A	and a cat
B	well I can't get a cat I'm allergic to cat
A	yeah but I reckon we should just get it on a trial basis
B	I don't think you can do that with a cat it's not a blooming
A	sort of like a
B	no
A	no well
B	I do have a cat allergy which
A	yeah I was just
B	we seem to have somehow forgotten
A	I thought it was like a general allergy
B	mainly cats
A	you've got a lot of
B	I haven't got a plant allergy Matt
A	you have you're allergic to some plants
B	am I? Am I allergic to plants? No no
A	yeah
B	I'm allergic to some mould
A	sorry I thought you had a like a pollen thing
B	no I don't really  I don't really  have hay fever very badly no
A	I've probably  I've probably  got it worse than you actually
B	sometimes it tickles but not very
A	my dad had hay fever or he said he did
B	it doesn't really bother us
A	it's a bit mellow for Kerrang this is isn't it?
B	I know I was thinking that actually I wonder if it's some
A	no don't turn it over it they'll probably  they'll probably  get better
B	no no I just wondered what what was on
A	the the overlord of Alex Baker the overlord of upcoming and under the radar music
B	so it's
A	he's the overlord but he's under the radar
B	well it's better than Loz Guest
A	slander
B	so
B	he's so bad
A	meh
B	huh? Um

B	Jane Eyre Pride And Prejudice Wuthering Heights
A	sorry what yeah I was  I was  getting you know looking at this sandwich which could be the tastiest tuna sandwich of all time
B	it is really nice but have it's like I thought it was uh it tasted a bit
A	no no I'm not  I'm not  ready to taste it I'm just sort of  sort of  feeling it a bit
B	why? Are you not? How can you not be hungry? I was quite hungry
A	no well I will be minute I will be in a while
B	see if the rest of your message has arrived
A	got loads of rocket so it's gonna give it a
B	it's nice I like I'll I might grow some rocket
A	Ray Winston was wanted to make a a
B	what?
A	I think they should make a film of Tin Drum
B	oh we're missing  we're missing  Homeland but I've read the Wikipedia page so
A	you've read the Wikipedia page? No no you've spoilt it man
B	no but you see you didn't wanna
A	I don't really like it though
B	yeah it is actually what are we doing we should've watched
A	we're missing Benidorm
B	but Benidorm's on the plus one though that's the good thing we can watch it at ten
A	ah yeah well we'll we'll watch it on the
B	I'll just see
A	it's alright
B	I didn't know
A	yeah I think I don't think I don't
B	but I like the story
A	I don't fancy having to watch like like whole series of it you know like American twenty-two episode series
B	but I like the  I like the  um
A	I felt it
B	it did it was quite explicit but like not very much
A	uh to the extent that you you can't
B	mhm
A	but uh I felt that in that in the show it wasn't relevant to terrorism and espionage
B	no I I think some bits were
A	oh yeah yeah yeah if it's  if it's if it's  part of the story you know yeah just a total granddad aren't I uh?
B	like I think some of those bits
A	if it's  if it's  part of the uh
B	but there was bits where like it was you know it was by what happened it was quite obvious that he hadn't
A	uh
B	it's like the same colour as the carpet
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	A lot gratuitous
B	yeah
A	anyway that's not even  that's not even  apart from the granddad aspect uh
B	but yeah so I I thought like
A	it's kinda implausible I think
B	I'd really like stopped myself from watching all the rest
A	but the interesting thing is that
B	uh sorry what stopped myself from
A	the interesting thing is it was originally um Israeli and it it had like a it came from an Israeli series that they'd already made
B	oh really?
A	I thought I told you
B	no
A	I think I did
B	I read the Wikipedia page and I didn't even get that
A	but it says it right at the beginning
B	must've skimmed that bit
A	it's the the the Israeli title means something like um um it it it doesn't mean it's not called that in in in Hebrew it's called like another word
B	what Homeland?
A	not called Homeland it's not called the Hebrew word for Homeland
B	yeah
A	it's it's called like
B	ah crap I didn't put that washing in
A	well d'you have to?
B	I think it's like my work things
A	oh no that's cool but you really should've seen to that earlier shouldn't you?
B	I'm such an idiot
A	no I'll bring
B	there's only a few things
B	think it's my work things
A	so it's like an essential wash?
B	no well sort of
A	um I think I'm alright
B	did you wash these by the way in the end?
A	I did actually I hand washed them
B	and uh have they done better?
A	A little bit
B	okay
A	um I hand washed them because I didn't wanna
B	oh but if you put them in with darks like everything in there's dark
A	well I thought  I thought  of that but just the way that it  that it  worked it like there wasn't  there wasn't  any
B	yeah yeah bits of fluff
A	like like uh pinks or something I didn't want that to get all
B	is there any of these that you want washing? What about this Guiness shirt?
A	I think it's alright
B	what about this?
A	no they're they're they're
B	no unless you
A	no I think I'm my stuff's alright
B	well I'll wash this
A	uh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	sorry
A	oh yeah so I was gonna talk about the
B	well
A	uh it's gonna I suppose we were talking about Easter and the Passover but uh kind of
B	you is it is there something you wanted to do at
A	um
B	it's alright if there's not I mean we could just hang around and
A	something active uh
B	yeah
A	we could go on a trip to Ely
B	that might be nice mightn't it? I've not been
A	I thought about it anyway um
B	we'll have to look at the buses cos I think there might be like a
A	or
B	yeah like a bike ride? A picnic?
A	possibly yeah
B	that might be nice
A	sounds uh interesting
B	ooh smell that
A	there's some wine or whatever still
B	it smells like something
A	oh yeah
B	smells like something that I know but I can't think what it is
A	yeah yeah I know that smell from somewhere
B	I do
A	quite like sniffing this thing
B	ay?
A	calpol
B	no

B	no
A	it is
B	it's a perfume I used to have or something
A	oh right
B	whoa
A	is it's it's like pink Calpol
B	it does smell a bit Calpol-y
A	it has that smell like
B	can you get that to
B	yeah I know I know
A	it's a dial actually not a knob but it has to turn all the way around all sixteen clicks to the  to the to the  number twenty-nine
B	do you? Is that the answer?
A	think it's just
B	is that really what how you do it?
A	but sometimes it gets it it gets itself in a
B	it gets itself in a tizzy all the time
A	fix it two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
B	hooray
