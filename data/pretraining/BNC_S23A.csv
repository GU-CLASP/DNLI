A	I haven't tasted what it's like
C	slightly orange
A	tasty orange
D	mm
B	I imagined it being making the sprouts nicer
A	mm
D	it's a mighty green
A	I don't think it's overly
C	been missing out on the greens a little bit
D	yeah
C	I've been having yeah
C	I usually have greens every day and haven't had so many of them recently
C	really miss them
A	see interesting that you sent me the text going but fruit and veg I though mm she sounds like she needs greens
D	that wasn't even me that said that that was
C	yeah
A	but Co-op has loads of like reduced vegetables
unknown_female	mm mm mm
A	yeah I help yourself to all these different types of pickles on the side
C	have you got water?
D	good I'm alright for water think you
D	can I top that one up for you?
A	oh yeah I'm gonna try chutney mm mm
C	it's it's gonna be very sweet I think it's like apple and pear and cinnamon and stuff
B	right
unknown_female	mm
C	it should be okay?
A	oh
B	lid
C	yeah the lid like it's vacuum sealed on so you have to ping it off I think I don't really know I did the vacuum sealing bit and then I assumed it would all come off as one bit but I had to sort of
A	how weird?
C	ping it off with a knife yeah
A	er shall we put that bit back or I dunno?
C	dunno I
B	that's gone
B	it sounded like a tennis ball like
A	oh
D	mm
C	thank you very much
B	d'you want some
D	not at the minute thank you
A	mm it smells good
C	I didn't know what to do for some people so I just thought I'm gonna make something
A	you missed out last year I made teabags and filled them with all sorts of you could do we could teabag making if the weather gets really bad and we get really bored
D	mm
C	oh awesome
D	mm
A	I've still got all the bits to fill it with
D	mm
C	they do literally just take herbs and dry then out and get teabags and put it in is it that simple?
A	I made I I bought coffee filter paper
D	mm
A	hibiscus and
C	nice
A	raspberry leaves and all sorts of things we've got in the cupboard
D	I thought that was peanut butter
B	what? behind the curtain?
D	yeah
D	oh oh my god is that? jeez Louise
D	upgraded on the peanut butter
unknown_female	wow
A	d'you want some
C	no but can I have some of your chutney please?
A	mm yeah it's really nice
C	might try it out
A	er I dunno quite what I've done with the
C	I have no idea
C	first time I got these jars I don't really know how they work
A	mm
C	no tempted to make mead for
A	mm
C	for Christmas
C	that was that was nowhere near as successful
A	oh
C	it is kind of undrinkable for people
A	oh
B	for people
C	it is highly advised not to
A	did the dog see it?
B	the dog said
C	it's not ideal
D	definitely wouldn't do that
C	it's cos I tried to rush it I tried to do it too quickly and it I think it's gonna need another couple of months so I I tried it out and it's just it's just not finished it's pretty horrible really
A	oh
C	I still I still bottled some up and brought it down anyway but
C	with er with the warning do not drink this
C	mm
A	oh
C	hopefully by the time
A	yeah
C	the batch should be okay
C	I'm just amazed that you didn't
A	mm
D	I was drunk
C	and somehow allegedly didn't see anything I I
D	you genuinely saw nothing
C	so hard to believe
A	however for like months cos
C	mm
D	erm but then I was so I was also convinced that actually he wasn't
C	mm
D	just gonna pretend that that's the correct answer
A	then you
D	it was like a double bluff yeah
A	yeah
C	but you also guessed that it was gonna be tasty alcohol
D	yeah that's true
C	that we'd be able to drink together no
C	completely wrong
D	mm
A	no
D	mm
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	had Naked Wine before we've given them once
D	mm probably
A	do you get it too?
D	no I used to when I was in Brighton
A	oh my god mm
B	shit tons
A	good point
D	erm
B	shit tons
C	I think that's the right measurement
A	mm
C	of red wine for me
D	erm but d'you know I've noticed recently I don't know if you guys have? I have been on the quest for organic wine
A	all organic things it seems have gone like
D	not all of them like
A	yeah
D	although there's definitely been a dip because like in my local Asda for example I used to be able to get organic olive oil and organic sunflower oil and now you can only get organic sunflower oil
B	mm
A	mm
D	but you used to be able to get quite a few organic things there now you can't really get anything
A	mm
D	but now not even in Co-op which is you know one of the most ethical of the lot
A	mm see I haven't looked for ages
unknown_female	mm
A	because we've got been getting this box stuff
D	oh right
B	oh yeah cos that
D	I've been asking as well
A	but
B	it used to be like the mega easy way of choosing which wine to get because you wouldn't have to really bother looking at the leaflet
A	yeah just
D	cos there'd be like one or two
D	exactly be like one or two
A	mm
D	organic ones and you're like oh there we go we'll just go for these like whatever
A	that's a point cos they did used to have a really nice one Spar oddly enough
D	really?
A	and it was really well priced
D	mm
A	like about six quid or something
D	mm
A	and it had ducks on and it had all the story about how the ducks eat the slugs and stuff
D	mm
A	erm
D	mm
A	but it was really nice wine too but they don't
D	used to get that in one
A	they don't sell that here any more
D	mm
A	but I noticed they sell at the art centre now in the art centre cafe but it's probably about twelve quid there
D	but then the Co-op used to do a nice cos they still do their Fairtrade ones but they
A	mm
D	used to do like an organic Argentinian Malbec I think
A	yeah
D	erm
A	yeah
D	they don't do any more
A	mm
D	shocking
A	mm
D	mm
A	which was really quite nice and
D	mm
A	quite cheap and good and stuff but they stopped stocking that now here anyway
D	d'you reckon like people thought in the recession people aren't gonna want organic stuff so we just won't?
B	mm
D	well that was my theory
B	dunno
A	well it does seem to have coincided like quite well
D	mm
A	so
D	mm
C	what was that wine that we had in
C	one with like no sulphites or anything in it
D	oh my god
C	just happened to taste absolutely awful
D	it was also organic
A	it was? oh
C	it was just the worst thing
D	it had like quite a lot of I don't think sediment is the word I think sediment is another thing
C	like
D	it was more like solid floating masses in there a bit like
unknown_female	er
B	like a bit of pond scum in the wine
D	yeah pond pond scum wine that is a great description
D	mm
D	that's what they should've called it miraculously
B	be interesting to see how that would sell
B	pond scum wine
C	yeah
A	think that's true mm
D	it might work quite well like when you're kind of forced to go round someone's house for dinner and you don't really want to
A	yeah
D	we could
A	I brought you some wine
C	yeah
C	think we drank it all though didn't we?
A	mm
C	think we
A	anyway
C	we made our way through
unknown_female	right
C	yeah
D	mm
A	mm have you tried the chutney? I think it's nice
C	I'm not entirely sure how it goes with this but
A	I was quite enjoying it but
C	I just
C	I just quite like sweet things so
C	well sweet appley things
B	see I'm normally quite an anti-sweet kind of
C	I'm not into like chocolate or like
B	taste person
C	I dunno sweet chocolatey type things but apple pies and things
A	mm
C	I get behind those
B	mm yeah
D	didn't you used to have a big thing for ketchup though
D	not?
A	he'll eat it whereas I won't touch it
D	oh
D	oh yeah
A	that's the only thing
D	mm
A	doesn't go wild over it we don't have any all at all
B	yeah I don't mind like I'd
D	mm mm mm
C	no it's not
D	I have like
D	I have like tomato ketchup emergencies if I run out of tomato ketchup like if I make a fish finger sandwich for example
C	that's not as bad as the barbecue that we had though
D	mm
C	we had a barbecue and there was no ketchup
D	no ketchup
C	like the condiments were all just missing
A	oh
C	and it was er
A	that is like the
C	and we we had had like this enormous thing and it was just
A	yeah
C	gone and none of us had noticed
A	oh no
C	oh well we've got all these burgers no ketchup what?
B	shocking that is a little bit of a disaster
A	mm
C	it was kind of a disaster yeah it
C	god
A	you
C	thing is
A	can get away without ketchup if you've got like plenty of other stuff instead though
C	there was there was not a lot of other
A	mm that is the thing
C	well it was an impromptu one it was a very impromptu barbecue
A	oh
C	it was one of the ones that sort of comes together about like quarter to ten at a pub in summer and you go oh shall we have a barbecue now
C	oh yes
B	mm
C	so really they couldn't complain too much I guess
A	yeah
D	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	I'm boiling is anyone else boiling shall I turn the heating down?
D	I'm definitely not boiling
B	I'm just right
A	okay
C	yeah all good thank you
A	I have got long johns on cos I was outside this morning singing and it was freezing so
A	I'll just take my jumper off
C	I have skiing socks on and just the most enormously warm slippers
A	ah yeah they look awesome
D	I need to get my slippers involved in a bit
C	I think that was pretty much the first thing I did when I got here
D	mm
C	and slippers good yeah
A	yeah you need them downstairs there's a cold marble floor
D	mm
A	which is nice in summer not so much in the winter
D	how long did it take to lay that?
B	er dunno really
D	I'm sure I was on the phone to you and
B	I've sort of forgotten
D	at one point and you were like we're just laying down the marble
D	and I was like marble?
B	I remember now you were like
D	mm
unknown_female	mm mm
A	oh yep ha
D	where did you get them?
D	Ebay
D	the fountain of all good things
B	I found them they were kinda like seconds that have little chips in the corners and stuff like that
A	mm
D	oh nice
A	it ended up being the cheapest flooring option out of all the things we were considering that were possible really as well
C	getting marble?
A	yeah
C	there's
B	they're really thick slabs as well
C	well we wouldn't put cheap stuff
A	yeah they're so heavy like there's a tiny bit left in the kitchen for putting pans on stuff just feeling that like it's pretty bloody heavy
D	really heavy
A	yeah
D	oh well your house ain't gonna go down
A	I could barely lift one like
C	mm
A	so are you
C	so are you
D	I know but
A	oh
C	I'm only a little bit
A	but you had a tiny portion
D	mm
C	ah that's what it is
B	I'm a little bit slower
D	mm
A	yeah
A	mm
D	mm
C	that's what it is
unknown_female	mm
C	I take regular breaks for red wine
D	mm
D	I'm liking a little orange tang on the edge
A	mm mm orange tastes like orange
C	I'm
A	don't worry there won't be any bacon
A	at all
C	it has been a very rich sort of weekend
A	mm
D	it has
C	no it is Christmas so you're meant to have rich food at Christmas but
A	yeah
D	meaty meaty time
C	only for
A	I have made some really rich truffles
unknown_female	mm
C	nice
unknown_female	mm mm mm
B	so what was the conclusion with the wine thing should you pour it? is it
B	better? cos don't know whether you and
D	mm
A	about area and doing all this crap
D	mm
D	mm
B	so what was the conclusion?
D	I mean it does alter the taste
A	what's your honest conclusion now he's not here?
D	erm
B	I'll
D	I mean it does alter the taste a little bit
A	mm
D	but it's not always like it depends on how you like your wine basically
B	so it
D	it
D	erm they like
D	they would they would have it
B	right so like what the manufacturers want you to taste is open aired
D	well you can't think if you're having nice wine coming off small estates you're not thinking any more about what a
B	yeah
D	like you don't worry about whether you're airing it or not
A	mm
D	cos what they want you to have is just drunkenness
B	yeah
D	and then more Jacob's Creek wine I presume
D	but like
A	mm mm
D	and they can't do that for you like the wine is you know for whatever reason it necessitates being in this particular bottle shape or whatever
B	yeah
C	so what so if that's the case why why are the bottles like that?
C	why d'you not have like a big like screw top of it yeah so it can like?
A	it should have with a big neck yeah
D	mm mm mm
C	since then having to decant it into a thing
A	though maybe the metal would be oh cos but screw tops
C	or just giant corks
D	mm
unknown_female	yeah
C	just really big corks
A	giant bung things
B	the the cork's like the vulnerable thing isn't it? that's like the thing
D	mm
C	I suppose that's the bit yeah that
B	so the smaller that is the better in a way
D	mm
A	mm
B	but then there's the whole thing about selecting the cork for certain permeability and all that and like getting all that sort of finely honed so that it
A	yeah is that a real one this time? yay
D	mm
A	the bath itself is not very exciting old scummy you know
D	there's
C	oh right
A	bathroom is
C	just have a shower
A	we never use it
C	yeah when was the last time?
A	you could have a bath though if you wanted to
A	at
C	yeah we didn't have one in two years
B	just feels weird having baths in other peoples' baths though
A	maybe three years ago
D	mm
A	maybe four
B	it's not is it not
A	that is
B	just just is weird in general
A	they they're worried about their boiler not working so
D	mm
C	oh yeah one of those
A	they've just got into this new house and stuff but it's just like it's not that appealing
C	no
D	mm
A	but in any case it's just a bit sort of weird
C	having a shower seems fine like it's like yeah
A	yeah
C	I can have a shower it's just fine but a bath's just
A	it's a bit more of a project as well isn't it? and it uses lots of water and you probably wanna
C	yeah
A	once you've got it like you've gotta be
C	it is yeah
D	mm
B	yeah
A	though if they're not there it's not so weird
D	but also
A	but then that's also a bit weird too
D	like when you're round somebody's house
C	yeah it's weird though you're thinking it's not weird because it was weird but since they're not there it
A	it
C	yeah
A	it's
C	definitely
D	also like just being around somebody else's house even though you've been asked to look after like I would always be suspicious that other neighbours would be thinking there's a burglar in
C	there's a burglar in taking a really long bath
B	er
D	well
D	I don't think he was taking a bath especially if it's in the middle of the room
A	yeah but I mean if they're that observant neighbours
A	they would recognise our van or they would recognise us because
D	mm
A	we're round there quite a bit
D	mm
B	either way it'd be pretty hilarious if the police arrived and you were just lying in the bath
A	yeah just
C	yeah you
B	hello
D	yes officer were you here for a dip?
D	the water's just fine
B	well like
A	oh yeah
B	and
D	oh yeah?
B	it's just kind of like got a fire underneath it
A	they've got their fire underneath it
D	mm
A	and they're out in the sticks and you can see the stars and stuff really well from there
B	that is quite cool actually
A	but it's still a bit like well we'll have to like go from the house and
unknown_female	er
A	go out and have a bath and come back and
D	you see that's but that's
unknown_female	well okay
B	that's more of a like
A	no that's okay but
B	no like a look like it's not like you're going to get clean it's just like
A	no
D	mm
B	going for this experience so it's a bit better really
D	mm
A	mm
D	but also that's very much like I could get down with that because I like that's very similar to like what you do in an onsen in Japan
A	mm
D	so you would go out there butt naked but that is perfectly socially acceptable
A	yeah
D	and the way to do it culturally in Japan
A	yeah
B	and like hot tubs are just baths with bubbles aren't they?
D	mm
A	mm
B	be more than happy to go in those
D	yeah but that's normally their swimming costume and stuff though isn't it?
B	gets weird really quickly I would imagine
B	and the sort of tepid water outdoors it
D	they're normally like you'd be in a erm like a swimsuit for that wouldn't you?
B	usually yeah
D	yeah whereas like an outdoor bath thing I would go in naked
unknown_female	not if your mates are there to be
D	well no but in Japan you do
B	depends
A	I wouldn't mind if I would
A	but like they wouldn't be watching us anyway would they?
unknown_female	I hope not
A	that would be quite weird if they were
B	they'd be standing at the side with a towel
B	waiting
A	like neither of us really like getting pruny and that seems to happen like within two minutes of being in a bath
D	maybe you need to build yourselves up
D	maybe you need to start some training in your bath
A	training
B	before we go
A	I'd much prefer sitting in a sauna nice and dry and hot
B	two baths a day
A	mm
D	I prefer a steam room to a sauna
A	jump in cold
unknown_female	mm
A	oh no
D	I do
A	the air's all like muggy and dirty and weird and like you feel clogged up and like can't sweat properly
D	see in a sauna I find it a bit too dry
A	no it's good
C	I don't really like either
D	no
C	I think I've been put off both of them just by my gym and just going in and it's just full of big hairy sweaty dudes and
A	then it just
C	that's just not how I like spending my
A	no
C	whatever time it is so
A	that's a bit weird I've never been into one like at a gym or something that'd be weird
C	no that's the only one only time I have like access to them
A	yeah
D	you should see some of those spas
A	no there's a great one at dance camp like
D	mm
A	just like mainly nice and then you just run out into the cold showers run back in cold showers mm ah
C	I do quite like that actually
D	it is
A	mm
D	like I've been to some like there was a festival I went to the
A	mm
D	that was quite cool but erm
A	no
D	yeah
B	why cos it's
A	why?
B	limited visibility?
D	yeah
B	yeah I can see that
D	it's very much just like
A	but it's dark in there
A	but it's dark in saunas
B	limited visibility is possible
A	it's not like it's not like really light in a sauna it's quite dark
A	yeah
D	it's not like close
B	glaring
D	it's as least as light as this in most saunas
A	no
D	yeah
A	no not in the one that I like going in
D	oh well
A	but in any case even if it was light like I mean it doesn't matter
B	no it just depends who you're sharing the sauna with
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	I mean if it was weird gym guys
B	it's just weird
A	very weird
unknown_female	mm
A	obviously but you wouldn't go in there
D	no also it's not it's not just yourself it's more like the people who are like in there as well who are like looking at you
B	it's just a weird dynamic in general
A	no that's what I mean weird gym guys
C	especially the old ones
A	but like in in a kind of like
unknown_female	yeah
D	depends
C	yeah depends
B	I think one of the best hot tubs I ever went in was the muddiest as well
A	but you can also cooch up and stuff so they can barely see you if you're worried about your bits
C	cooch up
A	you can
A	cooch up cooch up
B	cooch up
A	cooch up cooch up like
A	you know you can sit like this can't you? like with your
D	yeah that's really natural and enjoyable
C	you look look really like relaxed there
B	make you feel a lot more comfortable
D	just sit cross like this
D	yeah I suppose not really
A	so and then
D	mm
C	and just chuckling every now
C	at
C	and like there must've been about fifty odd people in there
A	must've really dirty and stuff
C	and it was just like it was so well you finished and you're just covered from head to toe in like just mud and just horrible horrible stuff
C	and it was just one of the greatest ones ever cos everyone was just so relieved to be out of the cold and out of the mud into this
C	sort of floating around there
A	cool
B	so it was warm
C	yeah yeah it was warm hot
A	festering poo
C	they they were like they were blowing like some bubbles in it
D	smell
C	but they were
A	your grubbiness was probably killing the bubbles wasn't it?
C	yeah
D	I thought you were gonna say they were powered by farts rather than like
C	there would've been an element of that
C	a lot of people eating a lot of protein and carbohydrates to get through the race
C	suddenly relaxing
C	er
B	nice
D	er
A	er
A	oh er
C	it was good though
A	mm
C	it was very relaxing
A	well
C	horse poo
A	it's
C	would be the best of poos
A	yeah
D	to be in a bath with yeah
C	yeah
D	I'd wanna be in with them
A	yeah
B	if you have to choose any poo
D	I think of all poos
D	yeah definitely like yeah a horse poo
A	sheep wouldn't be too bad I think
D	oh no no no no no no no no
B	depends
A	I mean
B	how solid it is I think
A	well same with the horse
B	yeah well horse poo
D	no I think
A	mm
C	the solidity of it
B	rabbit poo?
D	no
C	I mean
B	yeah
C	but you'd have the problem if you went for a dunk they're quite small so
B	mm
C	you could get one in your nose or something
A	they could get caught in your hair
C	yeah
D	oh
B	they'd probably dissolve quicker as well being little pellets
A	everything gets in my hair
C	yeah
B	more surface area
A	poo solution
D	wow anyone gonna go for a little more rice on this note?
A	yeah does anyone want any more? erm
D	I'm gonna have just a little a little dapple of rice
A	more veg? fruit?
D	I'm good I'm good on the oh it was lovely very nice felt very healthy and cleansing
A	fruit truffles
D	mm
D	actually I think a little later I'm gonna have a bit of rice and then a little later I'm up for like
A	wine truffles
D	wine and truffles and all that kinda stuff
A	okay cool
A	you want nut roast and cheese?
A	erm
D	might get it all I might try a bit of cheese later with these truffles
B	mm interesting
D	mm
A	mm mm mm
D	yeah
D	yeah I know who was it who said that no like chocolate and cheese don't go?
A	mm no not sure either
D	they were wrong
B	that seems a bit
C	but I think you'd ruin both of them
A	mm that isn't the best combo
C	like
A	mm

C	apres this thing here
D	oh yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	well that was nice
A	yeah
B	favourite bit?
A	erm
B	didn't actually notice the orangey-ness that much
A	yeah
C	er
C	that is
B	yes
A	I mean not like oh no avoid a sprout
B	no
D	suppose they're made out of paper
D	mm
B	presentation
A	mm
B	the presentation of the presenting presents
A	mm
B	you got a Powerpoint prepared for that?
B	er
A	mm
D	well that happens to a lot of people I didn't used to like sprouts until suddenly we needed to cook sprouts
C	well
D	yeah
C	them up and sauté them with like garlic and or an onion
A	how are the sprouts?
D	huh?
A	how are the sprouts are they acceptable?
D	oh I'm loving them
C	I I don't sprouts I really don't like sprouts
D	but today
C	but these really are
A	pretty good
C	they
A	we were just saying like
C	kinda taste like
A	yeah we were just saying mm the sprouts were okay because you didn't have to avoid them on the
C	yeah
D	mm
A	so it was quite good
A	yeah
B	they become
A	mm
B	fairly disgusting
C	well that's what
A	we overdone them at Christmas Day like
B	well
A	did we overdo them? maybe
B	they were edible but
A	mm
B	but they weren't
A	but only like a gravy and hidden yeah
B	yeah you need lots of gravy
A	but I didn't at least I didn't do loads of them so that we didn't have to have loads of yucky sprout leftovers
B	yeah
C	the only time I cook them myself is if you sort of chop them up really finely and sauté them with like onion and garlic
A	yeah
C	and then they're really nice
B	yeah
A	sprout curry is okay
C	no
B	mm again I think like that would just overdo her a bit
D	mm
B	I think they're okay in curry if you put them in towards the end and you chop them up quite finely
A	mm mm mm
B	and they're just kind of hidden and you think it's like hidden healthiness
C	I like hidden healthiness hidden healthiness works
A	yeah
C	like kale I really do not like kale but it's really good for you
A	yeah
C	but you get the healthiness anyway
A	new smoothie recipe
D	mm
C	mm
A	very nice
D	mm
A	kiwi cucumber kale
D	mm mm
A	and orange or apple juice
C	oh yeah? really?
D	mm
A	and it yeah
C	nice
D	mm
A	very healthy
C	I love smoothies yeah I just find like it's just the easiest way to get lots of greens really easily and tastily
B	I'm pretty suspicious of smoothies
C	if you're in a rush
B	I have to say
D	suspicious of smoothies?
B	yeah
A	too sweet too sweet
B	I just like chewing things if it
D	mm
B	doesn't like I dunno it always seems like food I dunno
C	I like smoothies for like the opposite reason cos you don't have to chew them
B	smoothies just like weird somehow
C	so I will have all of my vegetables for today in these next three gulps
B	it freaks me out drinking food
A	mm
B	it's like odd
A	it is a bit weird it's a bit like baby food
D	mm
B	yeah
D	there is something weird about like you know
A	as long as I have water afterwards cos it burns my teeth
D	cos
A	well
C	yeah
A	I see it as like you know you've done the chewing in the blender
C	mm
A	there's a bit of saliva missing
D	mm
A	but it's okay for me to eat
D	no I know but don't
A	but not too
D	isn't there like a reaction in your body where like when you chew like which is why you
D	but like if you don't chew like the mechanical action of chewing sets off enzymes and stuff in your stomach and that doesn't it?
A	er well I
C	to an extent but I think just getting food in your belly just does the same thing anyway
A	like
B	yeah I don't think it does I
A	well maybe it's best to have a smoothie when you're also eating food
D	mm
A	and therefore it shouldn't be viewed as like replacement food it's just a drink
D	mm
B	a slightly lumpy smoothie that you have to chew
A	but I often make those cos I get bored of blending and it's so loud that you have to chew my smoothies anyway like
C	yeah yeah you're right
B	well the last one I had was
C	if you have frozen stuff in it as well that doesn't quite
A	yeah
C	go through
A	yeah
C	my friend's been on erm this thing called Soylent I don't know if you've heard about it? it
B	it's very
A	Soylent?
C	named after Soylent Green yeah
B	it's not that you poo the bed every night
C	erm
D	mm?
C	yeah he's been pooping a lot erm no it's just like a food replacement thing sort of like er sort of like a Weight Watchers type shake except
A	oh right like smoothies all this shit?
C	but it's like fully nutritionally balanced
A	right
C	so you could live just off this thing instead
A	just on that? ah how soulless
C	erm there've been people doing I know but like for a lot of people people don't like cooking and they don't like the effort
A	yeah
C	or they just don't do it so they just end up having
A	crap
A	like yeah
C	and all of the rest of his meals are milkshakes and he's been on that for about three months and apparently the first couple of weeks were a little bit weird and his body was adjusting to
A	mm
C	like like going from eating actual food to just having liquid all the time
B	ah go on
C	and now he just feels like better than ever like he's just
A	mm
C	energised he does loads of exercise and
A	mm
C	apparently there's a lot of people saying this as well and I don't
A	mm
C	think it would be for me but I think
A	yeah I can see the attraction for people like
C	but it's probably quite good if you're in a bit of a rush like just to get in a healthy meal
A	yeah
A	I can see how
C	healthy
A	some if people are like that and they don't like cooking and they don't particularly like eating like mother
D	mm
A	like if mother was on her own
D	mm
A	she would totally need that otherwise she just would like not eat anything at all
D	mm yeah
A	erm
C	mm
A	like
C	apparently it's not the tastiest thing
A	er
A	oh no that's even worse though if they can't even make
C	it's a bit sort of chalky and
A	er
D	er
A	er
unknown_female	mm
D	no
A	no no no no nope
D	no
A	I just know that's not for me but
C	but
A	I'd like to think healthy yeah
D	yeah
C	mm like it makes lots of
A	yeah fair enough for that kind of person
C	try and attempt to try it
B	bit suspicious of like someone coming up with like the ultimate nutrition thing in general really
A	yeah
B	or or like sort of being able to pre-empt everyone's kind of needs in a way
A	yeah because you can have a complete like range of all the nutrients and stuff but that might
C	well people are different but there's different sort of things for different people in different lifestyles but
A	mm
C	I'm not that suspicious it it's
D	but like on a day to day basis you do change like what you need like and like other days you just you know
C	yeah true but a lot of people just eat the same thing every day anyway or
D	that's true
A	mm
D	yeah
C	if you're if you're having not much anyway
B	yeah
A	yeah if you're like having rubbish anyway
C	I find it hard to believe if you're having like a proper healthy diet then it would be better than that or as good as that
A	no
C	I can't believe that but
A	yeah I mean chewing is kinda cool
A	I'm with you with the chewing
B	in
C	yeah
B	in general
A	yeah
B	just like quite nice
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I'm not
C	cooking as well and like
A	yeah
C	creating something tasty
A	yeah
C	that's good
D	yeah
C	instead of just like a grey liquid
D	like that what we've just done I mean you
A	mm
C	well instead you might be like playing board games or you might be
D	well we can have that anyway I would imagine
C	er perhaps socialising or you might be but yeah you could get like an extra hour of it or something
A	yeah
B	it's true
C	which is which is his argument
A	yeah
C	which I don't agree with
D	yeah
C	but
A	mm
D	well
unknown_female	can you pass that water please?
C	but he is also
D	oh god
C	yeah right so
D	oh god oh he's been talking about that to me for ages like
C	yeah he's finally
D	last
C	yeah
D	where was he at
C	er he didn't come
A	drinking milkshakes?
C	yeah
A	doing all those things he can do now
C	oh yeah we had all the food but he doesn't eat food any more so it wasn't really for him
A	mm
D	d'you want some water
A	no thanks I'm good
B	that's it like
B	what do you do though if someone invites you in for dinner you're like?
C	well no he does still eat sometimes and he goes out
A	yeah
C	for meals and stuff it just
A	right
C	means that he's spending his money on like he'll go out for like a nice meal once a week instead or something
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and doesn't spend any time cooking
A	well that's quite nice
C	which is
A	mm
D	saves on the washing up
C	it saves on the washing up as well
C	you could get rid of all like your plates and bowls and
A	yeah
A	and a
B	you could have another room
A	you could have an whole another room
A	yeah
C	the benefits are becoming apparent
A	mm
C	where's your kitchen? I don't have one but I do have my hot tub room
C	yeah
A	come and drink smoothies with me
A	oh
A	mm
B	interesting

B	mm
C	you have like a busy week and don't have time you say

A	mm
B	yeah man grey
C	sort of beigey grey
A	oh
B	grey's just not a good colour for any food
C	no not really
D	see but you can see how like like
A	mm mm
D	like every single day but it's
A	mm
D	actually really healthy for me to make time to cook
A	mm
D	not that it has to be for everybody but I just think like for me I could very easily if there was something quick that I could use like that to not cook I could easily fall into that as like a bit of a trap
A	mm
A	yeah you just work or?
D	yeah exactly
A	bad
D	it's an important like break in my day to like
A	yeah
D	cook and eat and stuff
A	you see sometimes I'm just like at the office I'm like this is the only thing I've got to look forward to
D	yeah
A	that means I have to go okay then I can make dinner and have a break
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	and then I can do some more work after dinner so yeah

A	they're slightly
C	this is probably a bad
D	I can see for me they're okay but I feel they are quite tight in the width and I know
A	mm

A	mm
D	yeah
A	if you if you don't think you'll wear them then I'll try and like sell them on Ebay or something
D	no I think actually I thought from like first viewing I thought they were too square toed but actually once they're on they kinda stretch out a bit

B	yeah you could
C	that's beautiful
D	that's awesome
A	yeah
C	that is really nice
D	beautiful isn't it?
A	you have to play the guess the wood bits now
C	truly stealing it
D	mm okay erm I'm gonna say that one is olive?
A	no
D	no er cherry?
A	no
D	er
C	this could be a while
D	oak
A	yes but not normal oak
D	oh yeah
A	it's white oak
D	white oak but thank god you filled me in I would never have gotten that
A	it's got
A	it's quite unusual and there may be other oak on the scene doesn't look the same
D	erm
A	no
D	chestnut
A	no you're not even pointing to the bits though
D	well I'm just guessing it's a wood
C	name the trees
D	er there's no olive on here
C	er palm sycamore
A	no
C	great redwood
A	mm
D	mahogany
A	no
C	great redwood
D	er what's the dark wood is it from this country?
A	er the dark wood is not from this country no but it is
D	mm
A	upcycled from bits and pieces
B	there aren't really any dark woods from this country
A	no it's true
D	cedar
A	no
B	that's light
D	oh is this ash?
A	no
D	is this ash? no that's too dark
A	no
D	this is ash
A	mm mm
D	uhu
A	mm mm
D	erm
D	birch?
A	no
D	any more trees
A	quite Christmassy
C	I only know
A	quite Christmassy
D	Christmas tree
C	pine
D	pine
A	no
D	Christmas tree
unknown_female	pine?
A	well you know pine
A	yes
unknown_female	yay
D	uhu holly and what about this one?
C	it's a bush holly?
D	not from England I
B	you do
D	er rhododendron
A	no
D	er
C	sycamore
C	I think I've already said that
D	bloody hell
C	but
D	I've got nothing
B	perhaps you should just say
unknown_female	okay
A	teak that bit is teak
C	maple
D	oh teak on really oh
A	and then this bit is something else
D	well I've still got nothing
B	that bit you'll know
D	will I?
B	yeah well well I mean you won't know you might not know the wood
D	it's not from the pews is it? it's not from the pews
A	it's it's not you won't you won't particularly think about it as a wood but you might use the oil
B	it's quite smelly
D	camphor
B	no
A	erm doesn't well you you can grow it in this country
D	tea tree?
B	no
A	but you don't usually see it around
D	I've already guessed cedar er
A	that particular bit used to be a fence post
D	ah
A	but because it's so erm
B	durable
A	mm
D	no
B	er go on another clue
A	er menthol
D	eucalyptus
B	yay
D	ah
A	mm mm
D	holly
A	mm mm
D	white oak
A	mm mm
D	ash
A	mm mm
D	ash
A	mm mm
D	eucalyptus
A	yeah
D	oh god
D	er
A	well sort of but it's a different type isn't it?
C	oh come on
D	oh come on
C	that is hard
B	well just think about
C	white oak dark oak
D	dark oak
A	this is other oak
D	other oak
A	it's where this is yeah upcycled so it's
C	is that six types of trees?
D	it's lovely
A	and and the and these bits these bits are bicycle spokes
D	oh nice
D	nice
C	er what?
D	bicycle spokes
C	oh cool
D	awesome
A	so you have to decide whether you like it as it is or whether you want it oiled
D	oh yeah if I want it oiled
A	well
D	brilliant
B	it'll go
A	it
B	slightly darker and
A	yeah
B	more vivid
A	yeah
B	spilling water on that
A	yeah
B	that's what it'll kind of look like but it's on permanently
D	oh yeah
A	and but I mean if then you spill anything on it it'll be protected whereas
D	I'm totally gonna oil it yeah
B	why don't why don't you show show
A	oh yeah
B	that's not been oiled
A	that isn't oiled
D	oh okay yeah
A	and
unknown_female	oh oh oh
A	oh er
B	and you can kinda compare it to the door down the stairs which has been oiled
D	okay
B	cos that's oak
D	er okay
A	I mean different woods are involved
D	ah very nice yeah
A	and that's a eucalyptus as well
D	mm mm mm mm
A	so it's actually you know it's fine
D	mm
A	but like we thought these bits would come up quite nice as contrast-y
D	mm
D	yeah
A	but then this is really nice not oiled
D	well it's
A	mm
B	cos it it'll probably bring out the grain a bit more as well just like a thin coat of
D	yeah
B	the
D	I think oil
A	got one really warm foot now and one not very warm foot why?
D	oh the thing
A	does that mean normal wool or?
B	virgin what does virgin mean?
C	kind of just nodded and smiled it's like er
A	what does normal wool get up to?
D	all kind of thing
C	virgin wool
