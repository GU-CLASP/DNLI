A	I've put it to the slowest tempo so that it records
B	erm and then
A	yeah and her face
B	was so so funny
A	so serious like she's concentrating and making sure
B	and when I was standing on the line she was like reaching over me and I was like go away go away
A	yeah she's
B	I can understand that she likes to play with her team whatever there's a time for playing competitively and then there's school
A	yeah
B	and you've got to understand that nobody's very good
A	yeah and we don't think really
B	what if she's playing badminton on Wednesday
A	fine for me
B	yeah that's cos you're a sub me and
A	I'm not looking forward to that cos I'm so rubbish
B	but you don't have to I think we much rather you played than you
A	well I'm still rubbish
B	no you're not
A	yes I am
B	you can't say that well then if you really don't want to play when you sub on whoever is playing with you me or
A	no cos that makes it even worse
B	why
A	then just stand at the back and that makes me feel even worse
B	you can stand at the side
A	yeah
B	and then you won't feel bad for missing any shots cos you weren't have been responsible for missing any shots
A	that's even worse
B	but I hate it when I am at tennis and then like there's this one guy and he's really annoying
A	I wouldn't sub on with you and
B	okay
A	why are you laughing?
B	cos I'll probably get knocked over by
A	yeah you are actually I was gonna
B	plus I've got no friends as well at tennis so it's fine
A	why is that fine?
B	well I don't have time can't make any enemies by being competitive I don't talk I just walk around by myself like just I just
A	obviously do talk cos you say just leave it
B	yeah I know that's when I'm playing I don't talk to them otherwise because I'm the only girl I'm literally surrounded by a bunch of eleven year old boys and it's really annoying and they're like oh yeah I can get loads of points on my Microsoft GTA whatever whatnot and I'm like haha that's what
A	that's what that's what
B	exactly
A	talk about the football and I got Messi oh I got Ronaldo oh but so and so really good good at shooting but rubbish at everything else they take it really seriously like it's real life it's just a game get
B	like netball
A	yeah
B	and everyone on her team
A	yeah and
A	and it's really also it's really annoying when we play and then
B	if you need back if you need back if you need
A	I'm like shut up
A	so annoying
B	and in the changing room she's like I love being centre I absolutely love being centre and I'm think well cos you love being the centre of attention
A	yeah I love how when they were talking about um
B	the netball
A	uh what she was in the netball team
B	yeah
A	how um how they were talking so loud anyway
B	exactly
A	and they were surprised that we all listening you were talking loud so that we could hear that you played with eighteen year olds and whatever so annoying
B	for really stamps for doing this bit worried just fiddling with it
A	can I do that
B	hmm
A	yeah
B	you should try doing a pattern on it or something
A	right
B	or try inking it I've got some ink on it you could try stamping it
A	um
B	draw a circle with
A	what so you're going to cut out the star?
B	yes
A	lovely stars
B	really good isn't it don't laugh
A	it although it easier to just do something like a stripy circle or
B	no I can't rub it out
A	I think a star would be quite hard
B	do it this way
B	it's not working
A	oh well
B	I'm just going to do stripy
A	more unknown dotty or something is easier than a star
B	everything's easier than a star
A	yeah
B	if I mess this up it's your fault
A	okay
B	which one are you using?
A	this one is that bad?
B	mm doesn't really matter
A	this one is good for if you want to do more precise lines and this one's good for when you get to the stripes
B	okay
A	cos it's a V so it cuts nice
B	oh
A	did you cut yourself? what did I say
B	I just sort of like spiked myself
A	yeah well oops same thing
B	oh we have to start organizing that erm Christmas fair stuff
A	oh yeah
B	and I really don't want to do that cos then we like have to get all the sweets and stuff
A	yeah
B	and prizes maybe we should get them on Friday cos we're doing that all in tutor time this week aren't we yes our ping pong surprise yippee
A	when do we have to when we have to do it last Friday
B	yeah
A	okay so someone has to get ping pong cups no not ping pong cups plastic cups and the ping pong ball
A	someone has to get a ping pong ball
B	yeah and I think we should just have surprises each cup
A	yeah
B	like not have yeah I don't know we should make it so you can always win
A	yeah so you always get something whether it's like a token that says have another go
B	yeah
A	or
B	oh yeah that one you probably want to use this this V one but yeah but you can also use that that but don't cut yourself
A	they're thick stripes
B	mm that's fine maybe I should maybe I should just give up on this
A	no don't give up on it cos then we can't try it out and
B	but it's not very good is it
A	how do you know
B	because I can see it
A	no you can't
B	I can I can see it
A	you can't until you've actually finished
B	finished
A	no you haven't
B	yeah I have
A	no you haven't
B	ah
A	maybe you should stop before you cut yourself any more
B	I haven't cut myself yet
A	yeah but you spiked yourself
B	yeah
A	that's why you need to cut away from yourself
B	I am look
A	yeah now you are
B	I was cutting away before oh
A	yeah that's why you need to use the V cos we want
B	this is a V
A	no that's a U
B	me and you
A	maybe you should just made a stripy one that's this shape
B	um no what I'm not even going to try
A	I think you should
B	no
A	yeah
B	absolutely no way
A	shame cos this is really going well enough as it is
B	yeah there we go all done not bad
A	that's not oh yeah that is don't know what yeah that's probably enough you don't want to get it too inky that's a bit too inky planner time
B	stop
A	don't know what you're laughing about love
B	yeah you don't need to push too hard if you got loads of ink in
A	yeah see that looks good
B	yeah it fits really good and now I've got ink all over my rubber oh
A	yeah look that looks good
B	no I've got ink all over my rubber
A	yeah but you stamp it off and then you give it a wash I'll get you some wet damp paper towel and then you just wash it off wipe it off even you doing more
B	I'm going to fill it up
A	you probably want it cut these edges a bit better so they don't pick up too late now
B	never mind
A	it's good
B	just the way it is
A	good
B	vandalism
A	no
B	cos it's your plan
A	technically they all say it and it's creative it's using your creative skills to make a stamp
B	what creative skills I ain't got no creative skills
A	well obviously you do because you managed to make a stamp
B	but you told me how to make it and what to do
A	yeah well you didn't listen to that did you
B	I did I did stripes
A	you used the wrong thing you used the U shaped cutter instead of the V
B	oh sorry I'm sorry got it all on my hand can I wash it off
A	yeah
A	right shall I stop this recording is going to be so weird
B	it's not working
A	you have to get some wet paper towel I'll be there in a second
B	I'm going to have a permanently black rubber
A	that's fine you can scrub it off right I'll stop this record shall I stop this recording
B	no it's fine
A	right I'll just get some paper towel
B	what are you getting everyone for Christmas
A	uh I think I'm going to do this get some more things yeah I don't know like putting them in a jar
B	yeah well that's quite cool but I can't copy you now
A	it's my idea
B	I think maybe I'll put mine in a box
A	okay
B	a box that resembles a jar and call it
A	no I was so annoyed at you when you copied me
B	shall I call mine
A	inventions
A	mm that's so annoying I still do
B	no yes obviously I do
A	no you don't
B	yeah I do
A	that works well done oh thanks and I'm going to do some J on that one you can because it was actually yours
B	but I did invent my piano

B	there you go one Z done I think I'm going to get people like probably I'll get some jars and I'll put like
A	I've got a knife here I'll stab you
B	no what I think I'm going to do is
A	no I'll stop you
B	is make some
A	I think of another idea for you to do
B	no I'm going to get like sweets from people a chocolate
A	okay
B	or maybe I'll get them lip balms
A	no you could do that that's fine with me just as long as you don't put them in a jar
B	maybe I'll get some lip balms and put them all in a jar and give them to people
A	no not allowed to do that cos I like my idea and it's nice and original and you're not allowed to take it
B	I think maybe I'll
A	and you can't tell anybody
B	okay
A	what they will but yeah that's for your pocket
B	thanks
A	yeah you could do that as well that's good for me got an itchy nose
B	but they wouldn't last very long as Christmas presents
A	yeah well they're early Christmas presents and you just have to eat your Christmas present
B	maybe I'll
A	but that's a good idea
B	chocolates yeah I actually have like a chocolate maker
A	how can it actually make chocolate
B	no I mean like um like um one of them things
A	moulds
B	yeah of like mini chocolate bars I'm going to do that and put them in little bags

B	I'm gonna make them and I'm going to do like different ones and put like raspberry in them
A	raspberry
B	raspberry and put little bits of banana in them like how cool would that be like banana chocolate you have to be inventive in this world if you do it
A	actually now spent too much you mustn't be too inventive you're not allowed to do that
B	why is it too inventive
A	yeah it's too inventive now it makes mine look boring

A	yeah are you going to get
B	no I don't think so I don't know maybe
A	the problem is I don't know who is getting me a present and I feel really awkward

A	if they got me a present and I don't have them a present
B	maybe I'll just get all our girls and our tutor

B	um apart from a pug on Friday when we go to Ken Stevens cos I want to look at ukulele strings

A	yeah how is that supposed to look like a cat
B	a cat and then like a really long fuzzy pipe cleaner tail which looks like it's been rolled around in mud fifteen times it's ridiculous and she said you can wear some things to cover up if you feel a bit more comfortable so I'm tempted to ask her if I can just wear a black t-shirt and black leggings over the top cos that will make me feel a bit more comfortable
A	what because it's so tight
B	yeah because some people might not be comfortable cos the boys have to wear that as well
A	what the boys have to wear
