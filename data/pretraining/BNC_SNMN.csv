A	what's
C	he goes to
A	oh does he? what to study?

D	well it's if
B	so like
D	in your body
A	mm?
B	had lots of slow-twitch fibres that's why he couldn't run long
D	mm
B	and Usain Bolt's got really short twitch fibres
D	right so say you got a hundred percent of your body is made up
A	mm?
D	you have a propensity so you might have forty percent that are slow-twitch forty percent that are erm fast-twitch and obviously if you're a sprinter you want more fast-twitch erm fibres cos they react quicker
A	right?
D	and slow twitch are about endurance and then you've got twenty percent that are undetermined and depending on what training you do
A	yeah?
D	you can train those fibres to be fast or slow-twitches
A	why have I never heard of this?
D	I'm quite surprised cos you are the font of all knowledge
A	I've never heard of
