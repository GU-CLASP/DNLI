A	so one time
B	one time erm she turned around and the same thing as normal laughing and and she's just I don't know what it was she just changed and crying and us lying on the table and I was absolutely dying I did that somewhere else as well one of the teachers
A	maybe it was Mrs
B	make me laugh always laughing
A	Mrs
B	yeah she's really funny
A	in a good way funny though like laughing at her
B	laughing at other certain teachers
A	yes
B	uh huh
A	where did I put my juice
B	it's there
A	there it is
B	we're going to get so many different teachers next year cos
A	yeah
B	cos for science you never have three teachers it scares me how like twelve lessons of science
A	yeah
B	that's gonna be
A	ridiculous
B	that's more than maths or English
A	yeah but basically the whole timetable is just science but still want to do triple science
B	what if you don't do triple science you still have to do that much science
A	yeah you still have to
B	but with one teacher
A	oh yeah
B	nightmare
A	yeah
B	but what you going to choose do we do you know if we're getting any triple science option then
A	no I don't think so it has to be one of your options I think but I'm not sure but I think so
B	I wish it wasn't
A	yeah but then in a way it's good because we get more time for science so we have more time to get a better grade
B	but I really want to take art
A	yeah well art is my number two option my first one is triple science
B	uh huh
A	then after then then
B	French
A	oh yeah French or Spanish I'm thinking Spanish
B	Spanish
A	but
B	but because only general French is a bit more of a common language to
A	yeah but then when you think about it Spanish is a more widely spoken language as in countries
B	yeah
A	it's just that lots of people learn French so when you go to South America and stuff they will speak Spanish
B	but
A	only France will some other places do as well but only France speaks French and then there's just more people know how to speak French so I don't know
B	but you guess you have a job and they needed you to do speak a language French would probably
A	yeah I guess
B	and what are you going to take last? music or
A	well I'm going I did want to take music um yeah
B	are you going to take a
A	yeah I probably won't if I did I'd take geography
B	what would you take instead of music and if you didn't take humanities
A	then I would take music if I did take humanities cos there's nothing else I'd really want to do
B	computing
A	yep RE
B	RE
A	philosophy no philosophy and ethics
B	oh it's really awkward cos
A	like how you've already finished your toast and I'm still spreading
B	I think cos you were tracing your
A	my little
B	good luck trying to carve that one
A	yeah and this one like flushing shocked face pain
B	I think that I'm gonna take history but I'm not very good at history
A	yeah you are
B	I don't even like history
A	well then why do you want to take it
B	I don't like geography either I like history because I like Mrs
A	well if you take history you take someone else
B	well she's going to be gone by the time we take our options anyway
A	yeah but then she'll come back
B	she's not coming back
A	I thought she said she was coming back
B	I don't think so I think she's going to have the baby over Christmas
A	yeah
B	she said she'd come back for like a day to show the new person around and then probably that was it
A	yeah I like Miss
B	but I don't know I'm not I'm really not brilliant at history and I don't I don't really like history or geography I mean I like them but not really
A	do you want to take both of them?
B	well I was going to but now I think I'll take music instead
A	instead of which one?
B	one of them
A	well
B	not going to take art
A	oh okay
B	because I can't take a humanities if I take art if I take human science with language humanities music
A	oh yeah
B	art
A	yeah well you can still do art like
B	yeah
A	go at lunch
B	after school and stuff
A	and you can do arts award if you ever get round to it
B	get round to it I started it before the summer holidays
A	yeah
B	did about three pages and then gave up
A	I keep meaning to do it
B	mm mm
A	but I never get round to it
B	I'm really worried that the end of year nine I'm not going to be able to get the level you need to take top set take triple science
A	do you have to take a
B	oh yeah but it's
A	don't you remember Miss
B	some levels if I do really bad in my test but this one I don't understand anything
A	you do understand that
B	apparently it's the same one maybe I'll just when is it Thursday
A	uh huh
B	I'll get
A	got science and maths test on Thursday
B	well at least you know what it's like now just remember on the last question you won't get unknown you'll probably be fine
A	what happens on the last question
B	last question I thought I was an idiot cos it even had an angle that said forty degrees I thought that it was I don't know radius meets
A	so it doesn't need a tangent thing
B	well it says why does it not need why does this not be a tangent and I wrote radius meets tangent ant ninety degrees actually the radius I have to prove that the radius doesn't mean a tangent at ninety degrees and then I crossed it out I don't know I'm rubbish in tests
A	that is true though shouldn't be talking
B	I wasn't talking our table's like the good table apart from
A	what are you no what were you going to say?
B	can't remember no I was going to say don't know what I was going to say
A	I was going to say what are you doing in maths now?
B	I don't know cos we did the test today
A	did he not tell you what you were going to do or something?
B	no which is great we're probably doing something really hard like algebra actually I don't mind algebra
A	I don't mind algebra
B	that's cos you're clever I don't like doing the um well I like doing the balancing the equations in algebra I do them I remember I was so proud of myself Miss
A	oh yeah
B	even though I tried really hard on that and the level wasn't really and I was like yeah I got a level eight and
A	do you want any more to drink
B	um no I'm fine
A	okay
B	I haven't had any homework recently at all
A	neither have I
B	yeah it's like had test test test there's millions and millions of tests oh next Monday one week today is the French reading and listening test and on Wednesday the Spanish reading and listening test and on Thursday the French writing test
A	we got so many tests
B	I just realised the French writing test we're doing speaking and writing at the same time
A	no we're not that's Spanish
B	but yeah I missed it out
A	no one one we are just doing writing we're not doing writing and speaking
B	good
A	I don't know how could I learn that
B	neither do I
A	well last time I just spent the weekend writing it over and over again
B	yeah
A	it took so long
B	but you learnt it
A	yeah and I was really pleased with myself and then I came in cos that was for language features and all week of you just had like thirty words and I tried to get it down to twenty
B	oh yeah
A	and now they're thirty I'm not sure we were supposed to have twenty but then you all came in with thirty and then they were like oh yeah that's fine just do it with thirty but I was really annoyed cos I spent ages learning it and I only needed
B	I hate speaking because the whole class can hear you
A	yeah I hate that
B	and there's much pressure cos if you get something wrong the teacher goes and they like raise their eyebrows and they're like oh for goodness sake
A	um well it's it's fine when you get into it but starting it is really awkward and so quiet and everyone is like listening to you
B	I know do you remember
A	yeah
B	and we're like whoa and the teacher was like oh that was Mr
A	and no one wanted to volunteer and she was like
B	sounds like okay I'll do mine oh today in IT in every lesson the guy called me
A	I don't mind product design
B	yeah I don't know I'm not very good at it like I can make the stuff with lots of help but I don't but I'm not very good at designing it like the design process and all of that I was really proud of myself cos I was the first person to finish the web blog
A	what oh yeah now you're doing that 3D drawing thing
B	oh god I haven't started it yet have to do it
A	think that was fun
B	probably cos you were good at computers like the computer whizz programming and stuff but I can't
A	I'm sure you can you're just lying
B	no if you saw some of my old like things that me and
A	I've never done it before at school what's the programme called
B	don't know oh I wasn't to try and do it sometime I think I'm going to learn some of this writing for Spanish
A	well done you
B	cos I can't be bothered to read through science
A	yeah
B	saying that I'm not going to be able to do it
A	I'm not looking forward to Spanish test
B	I'm not looking forward to any test we've to an English test coming up soon
A	oh yeah so many tests
B	really surprised because I haven't really done that badly in my English tests this year
A	yeah you can't say that you've done really well
B	but I've never like before whenever like I don't know like the first one I got a fairly high level compared to everyone else but last year I never got any I just got average no it wasn't average
A	above average
B	above average in the class apart from
A	oh yeah hmm
B	when's the Jesus college thing
A	um tenth fifth
B	oh yeah maybe carols Mr
A	alright if we do what
B	volunteering for that coffee and carols morning thing
A	what so did he not ask
B	no and I didn't ask either but I'm sure we can while the wind band aren't playing
A	like after the wind band go yeah we can stay actually it doesn't matter cos I don't want to miss the lessons
B	like always
A	I don't want to miss out on anything because you know
B	because a nerd
A	studious
B	studious that's what I was going to say
A	yeah can do a little stamp rubber
B	if I wreck this I'm going to be really annoyed cos it's about my only rubber it literally is my only rubber apart from I've got some at home but I can't find them
A	what what
B	wind band songs got so many musical things coming up soon like the carol morning
A	coffee and carols
B	yeah Christmas carol concert oh I don't like that one
A	what one
B	cos the church is absolutely arctic
A	yeah and we just have to sit in wind band
B	year seven I was really jealous cos you and
A	yeah we had our own little room so we had a scarf we just used it as a blanket and then we got out millions of hand warmers
B	and I was really jealous cos I was just stuck with the wind band and I didn't have any friends there
A	ah poor
B	I don't know careful you don't cut yourself you're supposed to cut away from you
A	not every spiky you can cut yourself
B	I can but I probably will I can't cut away from me
A	that's towards there you go
B	it's an effort
A	it's easy well if you cut yourself I'm not taking responsibility
B	okay good
A	erm which one?
B	prank called some people
A	no I didn't see that one
B	it was so funny he prank called Ikea and well he was like erm and he asked people to give him funny phrases on Facebook and erm he called up this Ikea person and he was like hi I was looking through your armchair range and I found this really nice armchair that I liked and it was in the style erm hit me in the face and call me Margaret or something like that
B	and he also called erm like Carphone Warehouse and it was so funny it's like I bought a phone the other day and erm I've noticed it
A	that sounds funny
B	it was funny and
A	oh yeah
B	and it was really funny oops sorry
A	how long do I have to do that competition thing
A	annoying
B	annoying
A	yeah you were getting really annoyed I was trying to give him another chance and you were like no we're playing without him
B	otherwise you just go come on you have to be quiet before I go
A	because he was going
B	stop again or whatever he was saying right start again and I was like right guys playing without him
A	cos then he was like oh I won't worry about if you're quiet or not and you were like no too late too late
B	playing a game yeah no
A	the what
B	the Hunger Games were like the book and the film worst things I've ever seen in my whole life and I was like oh right and she was like Divergent was so much better but Divergent the film well in my opinion cos I don't think Shailene Woodley and Theo James weren't the right people especially as what's his name the guy that plays Augustus Waters
A	erm and
B	Ansor Elgort he's her brother in that
A	oh yeah
B	and that's just weird I don't know it's it wasn't the best film her acting wasn't very good but the Mockingjay was really really good
A	when did you see it
B	on Saturday the guy that plays Gale I think he's the best actor he's really good actually they're all really good probably why they're all famous actors
A	yeah because they're good
B	it was like a well thought out film I still need to find the last Divergent book
A	oh yeah
B	that would be really really wanting to read but I haven't been able to get it so I'll order that on Amazon
A	yeah Divergent and the Hunger Games are very similar though think about it cos they're both like
B	especially like at the start the start of the Hunger Games her mum is doing her hair
A	yeah that's true
B	and the start of Divergent her mum is cutting her hair in front of the mirror
A	and it's all just all very similar cos it's like a female hero who heroine and it's action and the first is like it's
B	like a sorting ceremony from Harry Potter
A	yeah it's like
B	which house will you be placed in
A	and it's like erm action but then as the books go on they get more bigger and more political and stuff
B	yeah
A	like the Hunger Games and like Divergent as well
B	you will find out well I've read most of the first book but I need to finish it see if you know how it gets bigger
A	it starts like Hunger Games starts with she's just a girl in the Hunger Games and then it gets more to her being face of a revolution and stuff more political
B	really exciting Mockingjay part two is going to come out but that's going to be absolutely ages
A	yeah that's going to be really annoying I I I yeah I have to say I'm annoyed that they did it in two parts
B	yeah
A	cos it's really annoying when people do films in two parts
B	I know
A	the Deathly Hallows I can understand cos it is a big book and there's a lot of stuff that happens in Deathly Hallows but Mockingbird they could have got that in one film I think
B	they would of but they thought I just want more money so
A	yeah it really annoys me
B	like it was only about two hours but they could of cut out some of it and stuffed it all in one I'm pretty sure the next one won't be so long
A	yeah
B	but it was really scary erm at the end like Kat and St Peter looked really scary cos peter had this really hollow oh I didn't like it you have to see it have you seen it
A	no probably go and see it once the DVD's out
B	yeah I'll have to get the DVD
A	I've got the second one I'm not sure
B	cos I got it for you erm so I need to get that
A	I think what we might do is wait for Mockingjay part two to come out
B	oh yeah
A	then we can watch both of them
B	cos then you can enjoy and just move onto the next one
A	or like watch one one evening and then the next one the next evening and then don't get too annoyed that it's two
B	I'm not sure I want to watch the next Divergent film when it comes up I'm gonna watch it but even though the first one wasn't that good
A	yeah
B	and like erm Tris and erm what's his name four aren't like I don't know they're not how I pictured them in the book
A	yeah especially four
B	yeah
A	like he's not right I know it says in the book that he has short shaved hair but I'd expect it to like become a bit longer or something and to be like dark sort of browny the actor was just not
B	their relationship in the book and in the film was really different in the film they sort of act like they're best friends in the book they're not it's really different and Tris in the book has blonde hair like really proper blonde hair and Tris in the film has brown hair and Christina she's not how I'd pictured her have you see her
A	mm don't think so
B	she does not look anything like how I'd picture her or Al or Whip or none of them it's like erm must have I don't know
A	I am a film I'm really looking forward to it Pigtails
B	yeah
A	I can't wait for Pigtails to come out
B	really excited for that
A	comes out I think they'll do a good job of that cos John Green goes and makes sure they're doing a good job I mean the Forty-nine Stars was really good
B	it was good
A	and yeah
B	I can imagine
A	I actually prefer Paper Tails as a book to the Forty-nine Stars ish
B	well they are quite different
A	yeah
B	know but I liked both but I don't really like the abundance of Catherine
A	I'm reading that
B	I've only read like two pages but I can't get into that's why cos I don't I got up to the bit I can't remember where I got up to I haven't read it for such a long time I've run out of books to read
A	I um I do kind of like it I haven't finished it yet so I'm not sure if I'm but I kind of like it
B	sure if I will
A	but I kind of like it
B	okay
A	I yeah I liked John Green books
B	I really once I've finished Divergent which I really need to finish
A	what
B	get them for Christmas but then from myself
A	oh
B	I don't know but they are really expensive book shops so I want to get it off Amazon
A	yeah
B	maybe I'll ask my dad to order it the last one but then I also want the second one cos I like the more paper copy
A	oh yeah
B	my nan's still got all my Hunger Games books
A	why
B	I lent them to her but she hasn't read them yet
A	so she just
B	just nicked all my Hunger Games books and I really wanted to read them all
A	mm that's
B	oh do a basket tomorrow
A	I'm going to be so rubbish
B	and PE last time wasn't the best
A	what happened last time I can't even remember
B	well you know netball with my best friend
A	what happened last time
B	in the changing rooms
A	oh yes yeah of course
B	but I've don't know basket was very competitive so up against
A	yeah I really don't like
B	competitive
