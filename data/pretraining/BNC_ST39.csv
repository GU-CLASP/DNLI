A	like just
B	yeah
A	and there was another guy that works there
B	do your part
A	yeah erm and
B	doing nothing
A	but it was him and he was like oh I'm just joking so we used to take this was like two years ago and we used to just sit there for half an hour in the Wendy house just chatting and have a cigarette
A	hide ourselves away
B	you had nothing better to do
A	yeah cos it is nice it's just not lounging round the pool kind of nice
B	no
A	not really warm enough when you're wet to just lie there
B	oh sorry look at my bloody armpits
A	oh wow
B	only shaved them other day like
A	I can tell you were German
B	I know it's ridiculous innit?
A	I know mine as well though
B	but I like shaved them two days ago
A	they're slightly finer but you can still tell they're brown
B	mm
A	alright what film do you want to watch?
B	I don't know
A	how about Snow White?
B	I really fancy watching erm a Disney film
A	okay
B	we can watch Ariel you were wanting to watch that the other day
A	oh yes let's watch The Little Mermaid
B	yeah
A	yes yes
A	I'm okay with that
B	so much excitement
A	I really love I'm not a fan of sequels when it comes to Disney like Cinderella like my mum bless her when I was going through my I want to collect Disney film stage because my dad threw away all my videos when we moved in
B	yeah
A	I was so angry cos I still have a working video player
B	yeah
A	but he didn't know so he was like oh this is just gonna go to the dump and I was literally like my childhood was in that box
A	and erm and so my mum bless her every time she found a Disney DVD or something she'd bring it back for me
B	yeah
A	which was so sweet and she bought Cinderella back one day but because it was French she didn't know that it wasn't the right one and it turned out to be the sequel
B	yeah
A	and it's called A Cinderella Story
B	yeah
A	but it's actually the next film and it's her when she is already married to the prince and she was moved in and it's like shenanigans with her and the animals and stuff it was shit
A	but The Little Mermaid II is fantastic
B	I've never seen it
A	so we should watch the first one and then the second one
B	mm
A	it's about her daughter
B	oh right
A	but it's it's genuinely really good like er well I used to watch it when I was younger so I don't know if it's still good but
B	yeah we'll watch that then
A	it's like a Disney film in itself
A	I am gonna get in touch with
B	yeah oh
A	so she can book the same one
B	are you coming to
A	yeah
B	the final game where everyone just goes and gets pissed?
A	yeah
B	do you wanna go to er to it? me and
A	sure
B	we're buying tickets tonight so I'll buy yours at the same time
A	how much is? thanks yeah
B	I don't know but it's ten pound
A	okay
B	it's nothing
A	we can always sell it on if we can't go
B	yeah but it was sold out last year that's why I'm buying them early
A	yeah sure well I'd really like that thank you I'll give you the money back
B	yeah don't worry about it
A	let you book it all in one go though cos it's easier and
B	yeah
A	at least you know you've got it
B	yeah erm
A	I've given up on getting the Bombay Bicycle Club because erm there's a there was a concert in London and the first time
B	mm
A	so it was kind of perfect timing cos then I could go from her house to the airport
B	yeah
A	so I said yeah I'll get on that
A	and I still haven't and it's definitely gonna be sold out
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	would have taken me five minutes on the computer and I just didn't do it
B	oh well they might not have sold out
A	but hey like it will save a lot of money cos it might just be thirty pound for that but
B	the drinks inside
A	plus drinks
B	gigs are fucking so expensive
A	plus I'd I'd go down for the weekend so that's my train tickets whereas and a train ticket to get from her house to Stansted whereas if I go to
B	yeah
A	I need to ring
B	yeah
A	I need to ask them
B	they will be able to get you
A	I'm sure
B	they'll arrange it
A	yeah yeah I'm gonna ring them later but I won't ring during the day cos no one'll be there anyway
B	well why doesn't she just like
A	well cos I'm flying into Stansted anyway
B	I know but you're going to
A	yeah but from Stansted it's like a thirty-five forty minute drive
B	right
A	so they usually pick me up I stay there for a night and I get to see
B	yeah
A	and then from her house station like ten minutes away from hers
B	no but that's
A	and then I go from there
B	but that's what I mean like why doesn't
A	to
B	in a train station in
A	erm because
B	okay
A	whereas from
B	oh right and change
A	so yeah so rather than go to
B	yeah
A	because she'll have to get two trains whereas in
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so it's just much easier for me to be the one that makes that little extra trip rather than her
B	yeah
A	mm
B	like I was like this is not helping me like you're not answering any of my questions she was like well you need to book in for a proper appointment then I says well put book me in now are you busy? er no but er no it's like well why can't you book me in now I'm here? like I had to limp all the way round campus cos all the middle of campus had been closed off
A	yeah
B	and my crutches I'd like
A	oh
B	cos I'd had a meeting booked in with my personal tutor who was fucking shit by the way he does not have a clue about anything like every time I asked him a question he goes onto his computer and looks on the internet it's like I could have fucking done that at home
A	yeah you need to change personal tutor
B	like he's really shit he doesn't know anything
A	I'm gonna give my personal tutor one last chance because he has got a lot of good contacts and bless him he has tried because he sees that I'm interested in the exact same field he is
B	yeah
A	but I think cos I was a first year and all of that he pays more attention to
B	the second years and stuff
A	the older people
B	yeah
A	so I'm gonna give him more of a chance and actually make more of an effort to make meetings with him cos let's face it it's not it's not his job to chase me
B	yeah
A	he's got so many students to care for
B	yeah
A	erm and I'm gonna give him one last chance and if that doesn't work out well then I'm gonna go and change to someone else
B	yeah
A	but I'm gonna
B	well like
A	give him a chance
B	my
A	no
B	like and stuff like that I mean
A	but to honest I think it's the same everywhere cos it's like once you get to university it's like you're an adult you have to do it yourself sort of thing
B	you're on your own yeah
A	it's like we're saying our experience with
B	mm but I just expected like better communication
A	yeah
B	that's was all like
A	no yeah I
B	no
A	I thought it was pretty shit as well had lots of problems like choosing my modules and stuff
B	I mean they were really good with you when that happened with your sister though weren't they like
A	yeah I mean
B	really really good
A	amazing and that woman
B	yeah verify
A	justify it I was like I'm not gonna get a note off off of a doctor like that's impossible
B	yeah
A	cos I was only back from
B	it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen if you did
A	so she was like oh that's fine then a note from your parents so I got my dad to write one
A	it's worse than my mum's my mum
B	why didn't you just write it and then get him to sign it?
A	I could have but kind of looks better
B	yeah
A	I could always forge a signature
B	my my mum's is as well
B	and
A	my one's I know my one's really bad I'm gonna have to change it cos it's just the A and an R
B	well mine's just a A and a squiggle that's it
A	yeah and it's
B	like anyone could do that
A	it's like that with an R
B	yeah
A	but I I reckon I'm gonna add
B	yeah
A	so it's actually just H de de de de de line D
A	but my mum's writing genuinely looks like Arabic
B	really?
A	have you ever seen it?
B	no
A	come to the office my child I shall show you
B	oh do we have to go right now?
A	yes
B	okay
A	yes we do it's of upmost importance
B	I think I saw a note once that
B	how do you understand any of that? it's so small
A	I don't
A	ridiculous I mean
B	she's a special woman
A	you need to use that
