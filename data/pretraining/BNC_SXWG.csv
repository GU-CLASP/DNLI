A	mm?
B	nine o'clock in the morning
A	dear that's a bit early
B	you
A	no no I'd like to one day
A	no I suppose you're stopping somewhere new each day
B	oh all all the time yeah
A	yes
B	all the time so you're away all every day in a different place I suppose
A	yes especially somewhere like the Mediterranean I suppose it's literally a different country every night isn't it?
B	well
A	yeah
B	Italy and other little islands somewhere we used to go to
A	yes that's right
B	yeah yes erm I think er your mum likes all those little islands
A	yes yeah they are nice
A	mm
B	have you not been to the Mediterranean?
A	I have but just erm Spain I suppose and Croatia well that's the Adriatic
B	oh of course we oh we went over there with your mum didn't we?
A	oh right expect so yes on the cruise
B	yeah across Croatia
A	Zagreb
A	that is the capital but it's Dubrovnik which is on the coast
B	Dubrovnik what's the other one?
A	Zagreb but that's inland I think that's not on the coast that's the capital but if you went with a ship I'd imagine you went to Dubrovnik or maybe Split I think Split's on the coast
A	oh it was Greece yes was somewhere
B	we went by that house down there yes
A	yes that's interesting
B	your mum's very good when she's out you know? speaks to everybody
A	yes yes
B	used to be so
A	that's right yeah she's changed as she's got older
B	she's er quite changed a lot now she's er
A	yes that's good isn't it?
B	chattering away but I suppose your dad being a school master
A	yeah
B	chats to chats to everybody
A	yeah well I
B	did he not?
A	no I suppose cos it was in a different down and it's different isn't it? so
B	of course we were at we were at school with him I suppose yeah yeah
A	yes but it was the school was twenty miles away so she wouldn't've picked us up from school or
B	oh no
A	you know seen any of the parents I suppose it was a bit strange like that
B	I suppose there's always having to have er chats with some of the parents I suppose
A	yes yes that's right
A	I suppose it's different when the school's down the road cos you would mix with the parents more wouldn't you?
B	yes I think was it
A	yes yes
B	he still had friends I think
A	that's right
B	yeah I think he went
A	yes I suppose
A	was in one place in
B	yeah yeah
A	so he knew them so he had this sort of continuity with his friends which was nice
B	yeah that that that went on for some time didn't it? yeah
A	yes probably yes that's right he
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure he went to school erm in
B	yeah
A	would've gone to
B	yes but he did quite well eventually didn't he?
A	oh yes yeah he did very well yeah he's got good exam results
B	yeah
A	yes he's still with
B	is he still with
A	yes
B	did they plan erm? is the wedding next year then?
A	next year next June but I'm not sure where it is
B	so that's definitely fixed is it?
A	it's fixed but I don't know anything about the details I've not been sent an invitation yet so I think it's just
B	oh
A	planned
B	oh
A	yes
B	okay
A	that's right I suppose he'll have to decide where it is because her family is all in America
B	yeah I think her mother came over once didn't she?
A	that's right yes she came over I think it was this year actually
B	was it? oh right I didn't meet up no
A	yeah I think it was this year and they stayed stayed in Edinburgh with them
B	yes oh yeah I remember did we see anyone there? I know your mum
A	mm oh right that's nice
B	do you know Edinburgh well?
A	not that well I know my way round I suppose the very centre
B	oh the centre yeah yeah well I liked Edinburgh
A	yes yes it's nice
B	it was much better than going to Glasgow I think
A	oh yes yes it's more manageable size isn't it?
B	that's the thing yeah Glasgow
A	Glasgow's a lot bigger
B	oh vastly bigger
A	mm
B	yeah that's right but Edinburgh no it's no wonder it's so I suppose the is it the capital city I suppose is it? er it is yeah
A	I'm not quite sure I'm never quite sure if it's Edinburgh or Glasgow
B	well Glasgow's much larger but I've I've always thought they
A	yes
B	have all these games don't you? with er grandma and I used to see those games
A	oh yes that's right oh that's nice
B	are they? what are those?
A	the highland games
B	that's right with tossing the big poles isn't it? huge
A	yes yes cable? what do they call it?
B	yes
A	cable throwing I think
B	oh yes that's I remember those
A	mm
B	I don't know how they managed to lift them up cos they were big things
A	oh yeah
B	sometimes they tried they got too much for them they couldn't they
A	yeah oh well
B	but anyway
A	yeah huge things like tree trunks aren't they?
B	oh yeah that's pretty heavy stuff
A	yes
B	you've not seen the games then?
A	no no I must go one day
B	yes I know where it
A	yeah
B	but I dare say that's probably dying out now I don't know
A	oh no I think it's very popular yeah
B	popular with people abroad is it?
A	yes yeah I think people go and then the Edinburgh festival the
B	oh that's pretty good yes
A	theatre festival's very popular
B	yeah
A	a lot of comedy
B	we yes grandma and I used to go to some of those dos that was
A	oh right yes yes that goes on for ages and there's so much on
A	oh that's nice
B	parts of Scotland
A	mm
B	oh of course I was mum your mum too we we travel around quite a bit
A	yes I think you went on a long holiday with grandma in Scotland a few years back
B	yes we did we
A	yes that's right you had a long holiday up there and you travelled around a lot
B	yeah and a lot of those little islands
A	and you travelled around a lot
B	yeah we did er when we were up there
A	yeah
B	forgotten the name of some of those little places now cos grandma used to remember I've forgotten
A	mm
B	what's it called now?
A	mm
B	where the parish priest is the only one of any note
A	oh right yeah
B	he was he was yeah he seems to seems to be there and that's about it
A	yeah no it's beautiful up there
B	yeah it was nice where were you abouts in Scotland?
A	it's pretty rural once you get beyond Edinburgh and
B	yeah
A	you're into sort of nothing land for ages it seems
B	well no no nothing further
A	it's beautiful but
B	yeah it's very quiet
A	empty very empty
B	yeah no that's right we felt as though we were we were out in the wilderness up there
A	yes
B	yeah
A	cos I suppose here you you get to a new a village quite quickly don't you? get someone quite
B	oh yeah probably four or five miles you know
A	yes you're never that far
B	no no Scotland yeah cos Scotland's very much bigger than it looks on the map isn't it?
A	yes that's right it's deceptive cos you start driving and you think oh that's not far
A	that's right and it is far
B	yeah
A	yes
B	course
A	yes mm rigs
A	yes
B	yes
A	yes in Aberdeen cos that's where they're all based
B	yes is he still in Aberdeen is he?
A	well he works up there erm but he lives in Edinburgh
B	oh yes that's where
A	erm yes
B	yeah I remember that one yes no it's not very nice yeah it is tough
A	yes it was a bit rough I think yes
B	yeah and er
A	so Edinburgh's quite gentile in
B	well yes
A	comparison
B	er that's right yes it's a gentleman's place and the other's a
A	that's right
B	the other's a work place I suppose
A	mm
B	is
A	he's in Edinburgh yes
B	is he?
A	still with BP
B	yes
A	yes
B	oh well yes
A	I'm not sure he enjoys it that much but
B	could be a bit boring for him I suppose
A	yes and the thing is you can't really travel with that you know they there's only oil in Scotland it's not like you can go and work in Devon or something
B	no no
A	you know that's it it's Scotland or Scotland
B	no it is
A	yes but anyway for the time being it's helping him get on financially so
B	I think we've got a photograph
A	oh that's right yes it's a nice photo isn't it out on the rig? yeah
B	yeah it's nice yeah that's it on on the rig that's it yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yes I like that photo but he's mostly shore based I think he's entirely shore based now he doesn't go out on the rigs
B	oh he's at behind an office desk now is he?
A	a lot of the day and erm er he's in charge of some sort of pipelines that come onto shore and he has to check that they're safe
B	oh does he? yes oh well
A	yes so
B	oh well nice little job for him
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah well he's still
B	well he's still under thirty isn't he?
A	yes he's fine as long as he finishes his erm chartership then he's fine he can go where he wants
B	when does he take? when is that? when does he take?
A	another year I think he may've finished it already I'm not sure
B	he has to do that in his spare time does he?
A	no they put him through it at work
B	oh do they?
A	yes
B	oh well that's easy enough for him then
A	yes
B	yes
A	so he just needs to stick it out and
B	no
A	make sure he's got that then he's fine
B	yes and
A	yes she's still studying yes
B	oh that's nice yes
A	yeah she's doing
B	well she's teaching English or did someone say?
A	erm I'm not sure about that I don't know oh in Korea she must've been yes
B	oh was it Korea she was
A	yes that's where she met
B	met
A	yes but now she's studying speech therapy
B	oh yes
A	yes
B	that's right that sounds an important job
A	it does doesn't it? yeah
B	speech therapy yeah sounds like
A	yes
B	yeah well that's good
A	yes that's good he's doing well
B	have you heard from
A	yes by email yeah
B	oh you have?
A	so she's fine yes

B	yeah
A	all gone quiet
B	oh
A	yes
B	what? this March?
A	yes
B	oh that's only well a few weeks' back then?
A	yeah not long yeah
B	did he make the rest of the journey did he?
A	yes he did
B	oh that's good of
A	yes it was nice
B	yeah you don't do that for a five pound note do you?
A	no no it's not cheap
B	all that distance
A	yeah
B	no no well that's good
A	no it's good he's gone to see her yeah
B	yeah did you do? you did some work in Australia once didn't you?
A	yes I had six months there
B	oh working with the cattle or something
A	that's right yes
B	yes well
A	yes that was lovely country but
B	bit barren once you get further north I suppose it is
A	yes it gets quite barren yes yeah
B	I don't think mum was too fond of Australia
A	no there was something I didn't like about it there was I think
B	mum thought they were all
A	bit small-minded
B	she thought they were a bit like Americans when
A	yes I can see the similarities but I much preferred
B	yes
A	Americans as people
B	did you?
A	yes
B	oh
A	yes
B	well we used to
A	mm oh right
B	so when they were over here they used to go to Stratford
B	and I met couple of couple of them there then
A	yes
B	except one loses contact with them
A	yes oh interesting
B	I think I did for some while have contact I think
A	mm
B	like all these things they move
A	yes that's it they tend to
B	two thousand miles away somewhere
A	that's right
A	especially if you
B	no well
A	yeah
B	so they don't bother with it no no
A	yeah
B	did you like your stay in America? did you? yes yeah
A	I did yeah I really enjoyed it I like the people
B	they are they're very friendly
A	and I think it's a absolutely amazingly beautiful country I think
B	yeah
A	much more than Australia actually I think it's got
B	yeah oh yeah it's not as barren in parts as Australia
A	yeah a lot of Australia is just
B	yeah
A	desert isn't it? empty desert
B	yes it's
A	are not very interesting whereas the States you've just got so much like huge mountain chains and then you've got you have got desert in the south er but that sort of wild west desert
B	yeah I
A	yeah I suppose so
B	cattle
A	cattle and sheep yeah
B	well I think we turned up somewhere there's a market was going on and terrible mess
A	oh right mm yes
B	all over the floors there
A	some of the farms are enormous out there
B	oh yes that's
A	no the size yes
B	they don't have those yes yeah
A	the apparently the largest farm is the size of Wales
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah lovely yeah well
A	yes fancy that trying to manage that
B	well I wouldn't like that sort of job no no no
A	haven't got a chance have you really? I mean just keeping the fences up alone is a full time job
B	how long were you there in Australia?
A	about six months
B	oh that's nice er
A	yeah
A	yes and I travelled around a bit although I was looking on the map I only covered about a third of it
B	well it's pretty big
A	it is big yeah
B	cos we well we
A	yes and that's the way to do it especially if you've only got a month or so
A	you know you want to fly really
B	end up in the east side then up in the north
A	yes
B	er can't remember where we were Darwin one that's north is it?
A	that's north yes we've been there
B	yeah I remember I remember going to Darwin
A	oh right yes
B	we were
A	oh dear
B	and then I had to go and sit her down somewhere and the only available place was in the local prison
A	oh dear
A	oh right oh dear
B	yeah that's right
A	must've wondered what she was doing there
B	they
A	what she done
B	what she done yeah that's right
B	no no no they were very kind over there though yeah
A	yeah
B	Australians I
A	yeah
B	except when you're playing cricket
A	yes
B	then they're they're pretty good
A	yes that's right
B	did did did
A	I'm not sure about
B	oh really?
A	and I hated them they were awful just very brash
B	oh were they? they are brash more than like Americans yes
A	yeah yes worse than Americans cos they were very culturally
B	yeah
A	insensitive considering that they were the ones visiting the country
B	yeah country yeah
A	so the onus is on them to adapt not the entire country to adapt to them
B	yeah
A	but they just didn't I mean my boss the first thing she sent was an email saying who could buy her extra gin cos she couldn't find any cos it was Ramadan
B	oh
A	and I just thought goodness that's your first business email that you sent out who's going to buy you alcohol?
B	yeah
A	yeah and then it was the equivalent of Christmas Day erm
B	oh was it? yes yes
A	Eid and she wanted to hold a meeting on it
A	and she said oh you don't have to come but she made it pretty clear that if you didn't go you'd be very unpopular cos everyone else would go
B	yes
A	and I just thought well that's really bad you wouldn't force people to come to work on Christmas Day would you in?
B	not really no
A	if you're in this country I mean
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	not if it could wait a day and it was the sort of thing that could've waited a day
B	I
A	well exactly it was a really big deal so yeah I wasn't very happy with that
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah so we didn't get on off to a good start I think there that's why
B	oh well
A	yes and she wasn't popular with the staff because
B	oh well oh no?
A	you know she just wouldn't adjust and she'd say things like well in Singapore this worked and you think yes but we're not in Singapore so that's
B	oh not in Singapore no
B	I'm I'm in I'm in
B	where's that? oh yes
B	yeah
A	yeah so I felt actually they were worse than the Americans cos I suppose at least in America
B	no
A	at least in the cities they must have
B	well I know from during
A	yes
B	cos
A	yeah oh right
A	ah that's nice
B	they er they were always like that
A	yes
B	cos they used to be pretty ashamed of themselves they said they having all of this money where we lived on a pittance compared to them
A	yeah
B	yeah we were paid a lot more than anyone else of course
A	yeah oh yes that's true
B	er
A	but I suppose they were volunteers were they the Americans? at least at the beginning of the war they'd chosen to do it
B	yes
A	it wasn't conscription
B	no no well of course
A	ah right
B	there was no you you you were you could have someone in the airport who was a mechanic
A	yes
B	and he would be there but all air crew had to be volunteers
A	yeah so I suppose that's sensible
B	oh no that's right and er yeah
A	yes
B	I remember yeah what's
A	that must've made a big difference to morale cos I mean if you've got people who have to be there
B	yeah
A	then there's always a risk that they're not going to pull their weight when push comes to shove isn't it?
B	mm yeah
A	but if they've chosen to be there well hopefully
B	they're they're okay yeah
A	you're you're gonna stick together and help each other out
B	er yeah I think that's normally what happens
A	yes
A	mm
B	did a bit of training there
A	did you
B	no I was too young at that stage actually
A	ah right yes you waited
B	yes yeah I did four years with the Royal Air Force mind you
A	oh yes that's quite a long time
B	yeah I lived
A	yes cos you were quite young then you were probably only about eighteen nineteen
B	cos I
A	oh right yes
B	I volunteered when I was seventeen and a half
A	oh right
B	I remember we had to go up to Reading for big er tests they were probably is he gonna be alright when he's flying in the sky? sort of thing
A	oh right
B	and they said I was okay for that lot
A	yeah
B	I was only seventeen and a half then
A	yes
B	so I had to wait till I was eighteen yes
A	and why did you choose the air force not the?
B	well I suppose it sounded nice
A	yeah I suppose it's exciting and you probably got to see a lot of the world didn't you? compared to say an army where
B	yes yes well I suppose you see er
A	it's going to be a lot slower moving about
B	yeah that's right that's right what what did we see a lot down there? oh we of course I did see quite a lot er
A	yeah you did you saw well you went to South Africa to train didn't you?
B	yeah that's right I was there
A	mm
B	and we used to go up to different places like where er who er who met up?
A	oh yes yes that's right
B	and there was another guy called an American guy
A	your namesake
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
B	er
A	that's right
B	yes
A	oh right yes
B	I think
A	yeah
A	but you went to Jordan didn't you? and Egypt
B	yeah absolutely oh yes
A	that's right
B	cos they took me out in er what's it what's it? in Egypt where we used to go what's
A	and Palestine as well you were there at the end of the war
B	yeah
A	I don't know I wondered that was it the canal you had to
B	oh I
A	the Suez Canal?
B	oh I it was erm we I had an
A	ah right for refuelling and things
B	yeah er yeah well there was a
A	ah right
B	and suddenly stuff they were coming up and down the
A	mm
B	er that's so where was that now?
A	oh Alexandria is it
B	Alexandria there we we'd go there quite a bit
A	yeah
B	we had an air station about twenty miles from there
A	oh right
B	so we we used to spend the well every so often
A	go into Alexandria
B	yeah yeah yeah that was er
A	yeah that must've been interesting it would've been very different to today
A	yes but not in Egypt
A	oh that's nice
B	and it was already prepared for us you know the some of the big shops
A	oh right oh that's nice
B	so they and er and they got home safely
A	oh that's good isn't it?
B	they're coming up with all these sort of boxes of marmalades and all the other
A	oh I bet you were popular
A	yes that's nice
B	yes
A	yeah especially as sugar was rationed for years wasn't it?
B	yes that's right yes
A	yes
B	cos my father of course well he served a much tougher job cos he
A	he was in the First World War yes that was tough
B	in the First World War yes
A	yes
B	yeah that was bad and he was wounded
A	bad conditions
B	he was wounded three times
A	oh right
B	and er in fact I think
A	yes
B	and they were short of erm so regimental soldiers and who would know what to do like they'd been away for about two months in hospital
A	yes
B	and they said they wouldn't order him back but they'd like him back and he would go
A	oh right
B	but he they wouldn't be ordered back cos he'd done his
A	yes
B	yeah
A	oh
B	you know he got the Military Cross for that?
A	oh did he? cor oh that's amazing
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's how he got
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and where was he in? France?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
B	didn't care much for the French he
A	I've never really liked them no
B	no he's really
A	yes a lot of people love France and
B	yeah
A	the French way of life and the French people I've
B	yeah
A	always found them a bit stuck up
B	well my father was er
A	and a bit cold
B	well
A	well that's right they kind of I suppose rolled over didn't they a bit?
B	run away
A	and the Second World War too although that was the government I suppose not the
B	yeah yeah yeah er no but
A	the people themselves
B	my father used to say when the going got tough they'd be gone
A	yes
B	then they then they used to have a some Indian fighters from India like fight alongside them and you know
A	they're
B	oh they were they were they were very good fighters that's what my father used to say
A	although they got treated badly after the war didn't they?
B	oh yes yeah they did yeah
A	they should've got all sorts of things pensions and
B	oh yeah
A	settled here and they didn't Jamaicans got treated very badly as well it was
B	yeah
A	after the Second World War
B	yeah they were they they expected to move here but they didn't or at least some of them did but
A	they were treated badly when they got here
B	yeah very bad yeah
A	yes that was a shame although it wasn't the government's fault I don't think it was just sort of the people's mindsets wasn't it?
B	well that's right and now there's if you were English you were top of the world like
A	yes but I remember seeing
A	but I remember seeing signs in about erm you know sort of B and B type places in the
B	did they say that?
A	yeah nineteen fifties that would've been you know just after the war when you know the Jamaicans were tried to settle
B	yeah
A	and it's pretty amazing isn't it? that that went on I mean you couldn't do it today obviously but
B	oh that's terrible thing that
A	yeah well it's not that long ago
B	no no no no
A	and you think of that as being a sort of South African problem with apartheid it was amazing that it went on here
B	yeah
A	in the nineteen fifties
B	I remember in South Africa it was bad of course
A	mm yes I expect so
B	if if you weren't a say a lady dropped a basket of fruit and then you helped pick them up you were stopped by the police
A	oh that's terrible isn't it?
B	yeah I I I was stopped once
A	yeah yeah it's not right is it?
A	yes well that's true to some extent I suppose
B	yeah I suppose yeah
A	you can't
B	otherwise you end up in jail
A	yes that's right no that's very difficult I always think that's difficult when you travel abroad but he's probably right that you were there for a reason and it
B	yeah
A	wasn't to interfere with their political situation at all so
B	not not no no yeah
A	it's best to not medal yes in the Gulf saw people
B	no I can remember when I was
A	well yes I expect they still do yes yes
B	the ladies I mean yes
A	yes
B	oh we had a visit from someone actually
A	oh right mm
B	yeah yeah she must've been the odd one out
A	yeah
B	oh no no she
A	oh right
B	she was the food and that on the top
A	oh yeah that's different
B	yeah yeah but er walking around er London like that must've it was quite a a
A	yes no in Portugal they do that the
B	do they?
A	the women the farmers' wives out in the country they still carry stuff on their heads and I wondered whether they'd picked that up cos the Portuguese were great sailors
B	oh they were yes
A	but you know back in the sixteen hundreds seventeen hundreds they were in the Middle East first weren't they? they were they were you know really doing a lot of trade
B	the sixteen yes
A	erm as sailors so I wondered if they'd brought that back with them cos it's the only country in Europe I've ever seen that I've never seen it anywhere else
B	yes
A	yes yeah because I lived erm in the south of Spain well sorry the north of Spain in Vigo
B	oh did you?
A	and that was just about twenty miles from the border so I used to
B	oh yes
A	go over in the evenings sometimes and drive somewhere like Porto have an evening out
B	Porto yeah
A	Porto's a lovely city
B	yeah I remember Porto yeah
A	yeah it's very run down and old fashioned
B	yeah
A	yes
A	I'd like to go again actually
B	they were a different sort of world over there weren't they yeah?
A	yeah
B	yeah that's right yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	Portuguese
A	and I walked from Porto erm along the Camino the the pilgrimage way to Santiago de Compostela takes about ten days
B	oh that pilgrimage?
A	ah yes it's quite something
A	yeah
B	and the and the sort of people on that trail never ending like it just went on and on and on and on seemed to be going on all day like
A	that's right yeah it's amazing
A	yes the Portuguese route's quite quiet in comparison
B	yes yeah
A	it was a lovely thing to do and it's just so rural you know that part of Portugal was just
B	mm yeah
A	little villages mm
B	I remember in Spain I think we were we saw one of those bull fights I remember with grandma
A	oh right
B	so we didn't like that
A	no I don't think I'd like that
B	no oh no yeah yet they the family loved it
A	yes well it was a big thing isn't it?
B	they
A	oh yes yeah Madrid they love it
B	oh really? oh does it?
A	yes it depends where you are in Barcelona they banned it
B	I don't think we
A	but there's always been a political rivalry between Madrid and Barcelona so
B	between er
A	a lot of commentators wonder was it really about animals' rights or was this just a a way of getting at Madrid by saying well fine we're going to ban your favourite sport
B	yes
A	bit like the fox hunting I suppose in the UK that people who don't like the rich
B	oh yes
A	and are perhaps envious of them deliberately object to fox hunting because
B	yes
A	let's face it only the the rich aristocrats can afford to go hunting cos who can afford to have a horse
B	who can afford it?
A	and a pack of hounds except the the well off? so
B	I remember when we came here I don't suppose it does now but from the bedroom window upstairs you can watch the hounds
A	oh right
B	over the moor like
A	yes well that's stopped now hasn't it? well not completely stopped but erm
B	er yes
A	well it's stopped in certain ways the the dogs aren't
B	no no
A	I suppose in reality it's a bit difficult to police that isn't it? but anyway there's kind of rules about it
B	yeah in fact they used to meet in the village there
A	oh right
B	yeah the horses and
A	yeah well it's quite a sight isn't it?
B	yeah
B	all their stuff and their gowns and what were these jackets and
A	yes those red jackets oh yes it's a really lovely sight
B	yeah and all those oh yeah they were
A	you know I don't agree with fox hunting at all but
B	no no
A	it is quite a spectacle
B	it is yeah no
A	yes and it is traditional but I suppose the thing I question is you know farmers will say oh we have to keep fox numbers down but the reality is no one farms poultry
B	no
A	free range any more out here
B	no it's all under
A	so if they've got poultry and they're in sheds
B	yeah
A	and it's all locked down and you couldn't get in without a key and get through several you know it's all locked down isn't it? so a fox hasn't got a chance of getting in
B	well yes no I know cos I used to
A	oh yes for chickens
B	chickens and stuff
A	I find it quite unpleasant actually
B	oh it's dreadful
A	yes yes I feel bad actually
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'm I keep meaning to stop eating chicken cos I I actually think morally that's not right
B	yeah
A	whereas you know beef that's in a field isn't it? so
B	yeah
A	I don't have a problem with killing an animal but I mean its life shouldn't be miserable
B	no no
A	it should have a a reasonable life and chickens obviously don't or pigs
B	yeah
A	so today actually when I was ordering I did choose beef and that did cross my mind that
B	yeah
A	I was tossing up between chicken and beef but
B	of course it's better than it used to be because I remember in my younger days with with with these in the town they were I think at the time er there used to be blood floating under the er the gates there
A	oh right
B	where they'd just been slaughtering them
A	oh dear that's unpleasant
B	so you could see the blood floating underneath
A	yes
B	yeah
A	in the supermarkets you can buy free range meat quite easily now in all the big supermarkets
B	can you?
A	yeah it's expensive though it's about five times the price
B	oh
A	but I mean that's really what I should do just buy beef and lamb because that's always free range isn't it? if they're always in the fields that's fine so just buy normal beef and lamb
B	yeah
A	and then if I want chicken I should probably just buy the free range one once in a blue moon
B	oh yes
A	the other things is they fill those factory chickens with chemicals and antibiotics cos otherwise they'd all get sick cos they they're too close
B	yes yeah
A	so you're ingesting all those chemicals which is not
B	oh dear
A	not particularly what you want to be doing with your health is it?
B	no I know also of course in farming days you know
A	oh right yes
A	yes that's interesting isn't it?
B	and so they looked after
A	mm
B	and feed them pay for the food but then they kept the money
A	yes that's quite interesting so that's the reverse of what we think happens
B	mm yeah mm yeah yeah that's right
A	that it was actually the woman who held on to the purse strings for
A	it probably only changed with industrialisation where the men were given the wages directly by the factory owner
B	oh probably
A	and then that money went down the pub and
B	yes
A	you know half of it never got home did it?
B	no no no that's right
A	but that's not actually what traditionally happened
B	I know we used to have we used to have some farmers
A	they do work
B	and then he got very cross cos one of his daughters thought that he they worked the mothers too hard like
A	oh right
B	and so I think one of the daughters took his wife off to Canada for about three months so
A	oh right
B	he didn't like that at all
A	no I can imagine
A	but they do work very hard on farms
B	oh yes they
A	there's an enormous suicide rate as well among farmers
B	yeah
A	even today
B	that's right
A	although I don't know if that's because the job's really hard or if it's just because they're alone too much
B	yes right
A	and you see that's probably sadly
B	yeah
A	a result of industrialisation in farming isn't it?
B	yes
A	before
B	yeah
A	most jobs on the farm would be in a team you know if you needed to plough a field it wouldn't be one man on his own
B	no
A	but it'd be a team of farmers who might club together and you do
B	yeah
A	Joe's farm one day and then next week you go to Bob's farm and you all help there
B	yes
A	because you needed a few people to to get jobs done whereas now it's one man on his own isn't it?
B	well I met one of the farmers
A	mm
B	er and he was a very hard working bloke
A	they are very hard working
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yes
B	but I spoke to him
A	oh right
B	still alive
A	I heard quite an interesting comment about farming in the UK the other day
B	yeah
A	which I thought was probably true it was in a book and I forget who wrote it
B	yeah
A	something beginning with T Truss I think but he was saying the UK has never been interested in maximising yield they've been interested in
B	that's it no no no
A	so you could grow something like
B	yeah
A	you know a high value crop
B	yeah
A	which doesn't produce very much and you can make a lot of money off that but it wouldn't actually feed very many people
A	I thought well that's probably true because this country is different to most countries in Europe
B	yes well yes
A	because a very small minority of people own the vast majority of land like
B	yeah
A	you know the royal family for example
B	yeah yeah
A	own huge swathes of the south west don't they? I think prince er Charles duchy of Cornwall
B	yeah all down Cornwall they
A	er and it's enormous amounts
B	yeah
B	do they still hold it do they?
A	oh yes yeah it's owned I mean it's tenanted out but it the truth is that person's calling the shots aren't they? they're saying right I want sheep on here
B	yeah
A	I want cows on this and they're calling the shots erm whereas in say France that's because of they had the revolution back in the day
B	yeah
A	land ownership is more equal so
B	yeah
A	you don't have that idea of maximising profit for that one person so I thought that was quite interesting cos we talk about
B	yeah
A	a food crisis in the world but if you look at the UK we're actually not farming very efficiently
B	yeah I remember talking about
A	oh right
B	that sort of thing and we had someone there
A	mm
B	and er the young lad er was like having tea
A	yeah
B	we had a jug of milk on the
A	yeah
B	to pour in the teapot but he thought that the milk in the jug was to drink and he
A	oh right
A	oh dear
B	very yeah
A	where was he from?
A	oh right mm
B	yeah in France he was yeah
A	maybe they didn't have milk jugs
B	oh yeah that's right
A	mm
A	oh that's funny
B	yes
B	oh well it's nice to see you yeah
A	you're probably quite tired aren't you?
B	yes
A	no it was a nice day I enjoyed today it was nice going somewhere a bit further away cos I haven't been to to
B	yeah different yeah that's right yeah
A	that was well I mean like twenty years so that was nice
B	was do the
A	I don't know I must
B	yeah
A	suggest we go there cos we could do a nice walk couldn't we over there?
B	no yeah
A	cos we
B	yeah yeah but that's that's nicer over there is it?
A	but actually it's nicer over there like the river
B	yeah
A	amazing
B	yeah
A	yes
B	it's nice
A	and you can do a different kind of walk because
B	yeah
B	oh yes yeah yes
A	whereas the
B	where did we
A	oh yes
B	yeah we used to stay erm
A	I must go there some time
B	yeah we must
A	mum's taken you there a couple of times
B	I think
A	yes
A	yes I know you like
B	yeah
A	I like
B	oh yeah it's lovely
A	but by road it was a long way round but if you walked you could get to
B	oh yes
A	it does actually yes
B	the two boys were it was a bit of a job for them like
A	I think I know those yeah the boys actually yes there's erm a ferry crossing further up
B	yeah that's right yeah that's right
A	yes there's a little pub there
B	I know that's right and they used to
A	lovely pub actually
B	they and they used to do run
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah that's not a bad job is it?
B	and I remember him years ago erm I saw him on television yeah Dimbleby Richard because he's getting on a bit now
A	oh right yeah
B	er but he remembered those days and it brought back my own memory cos he used to do it
A	yes
B	yeah
A	that's a nice little business isn't it?
B	yeah it was quite nice for them yeah
A	yes
B	and they
A	mm
B	you you know but er they used to just knuckle down and boat you over
A	yeah that's good oh good on them
A	hard working
B	did you row at all?
A	no no I've never rowed I find rowing quite difficult oh I have I have done it I
B	yes
A	do that but not erm
B	not out on the sea no
A	no well on the sea
B	no
A	to to row on the rivers those fast racing
B	yes over there
A	erm boats
B	what did I do with with your grandma once?
A	yeah
B	I
A	ah right yes
B	for for a short period of time so we went over to this place but mummy she refused to go on the boat thought wasn't wasn't good enough she thought she'd drown
A	oh yes those punts are very unstable aren't they?
B	yes one of those punts punting up the river that's right yeah that's right
A	yes cos er you're just it's a very shallow boat isn't it?
B	so it's it's yeah
A	if you move they really rock
A	and you can fall in it's not that hard to fall in
B	no you you would end on the end of the pole can't you in the water if you're not careful
A	yeah gotta be careful not to get the pole stuck haven't you in the mud on the bottom
A	you end up in the water
B	no no that's right did you do that then did you? when you were there?
A	I have been punting a couple of times yeah it's a nice thing to do
B	oh that's good oh lovely punting
A	yes
B	I remember once we used to erm not supposed to have done it but I remember
A	yes
B	that sort of stuff we we thought we knew all about that anyhow and so we
B	we went off and took some
A	oh right
B	and we were covered up by our friends they they what what what they saw what they'd done
A	oh that was nice
B	gave us their sheet and we just
