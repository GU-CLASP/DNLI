B	yeah
C	what more do you want in life?
B	exactly
C	but actually he's he's he is most I I think he's a really clever boy I really do erm erm
B	yeah he's clever
C	and he's got a sort of do you know the way he looks at you sometimes?
B	mm
C	erm it was very it was about Christmas time I think erm and he was about to go out with you and he was strapped in his buggy erm and I was sitting in
B	yeah
C	then he said something else and I had to repeat what he'd said and
B	yeah
C	you know? I I thought I thought you've had people say to you tree or whatever it was and you're just you're just now getting your own back on the adults
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	but there's a sort of ancient wisdom about him
B	yeah
C	you know? something you think you've been you've been here before
C	and it's just it's this sort of knowledge somehow that he's that he looks at you you know he's got something up there there's knowledge
B	yeah
C	erm
D	mommy
B	yeah yeah he is quite sort of
C	mm
B	he's like he knows how he's quite humorous
C	oh he's very humorous
C	but witty
B	to be
C	I think he's going to be quite witty actually I mean I know he's just turned three
B	yeah
C	but er so we're talking about under threes
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	but he has that just that sense of play with words or ideas you know? erm not quite just
B	he's going to be an interesting fellow I think when he grows up
C	yes yes yes
B	very interesting
A	you'd be disappointed now if he turns out to be an accountant
B	yeah like a really he vivacious though isn't he? well he could be a vivacious accountant you don't have to be boring to be an accountant do you? it's a very good job
C	absolutely
C	and then you could
B	yeah my grandfather was an accountant actually
C	I don't think
B	no he didn't
C	it was erm I mean
B	what's it?
C	yes
B	I think you need to know people though I can't imagine he got there by just going to his local
B	and then like now living in a mansion I can't imagine that
C	mm
C	although erm erm we we had someone who did the company's books but he wasn't a chartered accountant he was just an accountant
B	so he wasn't erm registered he just called himself an accountant
B	oh I see oh right I just what's
C	mm she's an accountant
B	oh I see
C	so she did four years
B	eight years
C	erm
B	that's ridiculous isn't it?
C	I think I mean you work at the same time as when when I say eight years it's not eight years full time study it's sort of like at night or day release or something
B	mm
C	erm but yeah erm and if you're a chartered accountant you can do erm cos this fellow works with a chartered accountants firm
B	yeah
C	and when you know the wee garages?
B	yeah
C	I was once secretary and treasurer I don't even like cars it er
B	I know I think you definitely got fobbed off
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	so phew
C	and then they gave it up we sold the garage
C	no we didn't we didn't sell it then but er
B	yeah
C	erm and then the government dropped out that erm
B	yeah
C	er for companies that I mean we didn't
B	yeah
C	we didn't make anything we didn't do anything
B	yeah
C	we didn't have huge profits
B	yeah
C	erm it was such a silly rule
B	yeah they're bringing in licensing for erm
C	licensing?
B	yeah
C	right
B	I think they're probably
C	yeah mm
B	but yeah I'll have to pay for a licence and I'll have to fill in loads of forms and things
B	I know oh my god
C	mm
B	so
C	well it's it's er
B	mm
C	I mean in letting you've got to be really it's it must be a nightmare letting anyway because you've got to get sufficient insurance
B	mm
C	the rules aren't quite so strict
B	no
C	no but erm otherwise it's just erm I did have a a little not an argument but
C	erm
B	that's what that's his his arguing is his current form of conversation
C	he said that if you if you let your house
B	mm hm
C	you should be able to take off your rent that you have to pay in another house
C	erm so that would not be you would not be taxed on the money
C	so if you let a house for a thousand pounds and rented for five hundred then you would only be taxed on the extra five hundred I said no I don't really think it works that way
B	I doesn't work like that
C	it's it's it's it comes out of your income dear and I said erm and it would be too hard to sort of you know? it would be too hard to distinguish the people who actual go somewhere else from work
C	yes the the the government should take that
B	should take yes because
C	and only for people who had to move for work so not for
B	had to move for work I see
B	I mean if you if you were in dire straits and you had to move and you put your house on the market then the government would give you I think a couple of months erm
C	right
B	some bits or something but erm apart from that if you can afford to rent your house and rent somewhere else okay if you've got extra and you're earning it then they don't want to know
C	you've got all these people that have got move to London you know?
B	all these people that've got to move to London I think there are people worse off
B	I mean I wouldn't be going round going
C	that's right he just he just couldn't see my point at all and I couldn't see his so we decided
B	because he has to pay tax on that they'll have to pay I wonder if they will they'll have to declare themselves as foreign landlords like me I wonder if they will
C	I don't know
B	erm and
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	that's the money I get so erm
B	yeah
C	people look at what I ought to get
B	yeah
C	and but I was never taxed
B	yeah yeah
C	but the erm
B	yeah but they'll only yeah I'd have they got much of a mortgage then left?
C	no mortgage at all
B	oh I see
B	cos I've got
C	right right but
B	I can take that off and that makes a huge difference that I'm repaying the fact that I don't have to pay any tax now cos there's a limit erm I'm not really earning anywhere else erm so and Ireland in the end erm
B	but anyway I don't
C	I I
B	oh really?
C	cos I used to cos my granny used to send in a tax return erm in the old days and she would just say don't understand
C	so I thought erm take it from my granny book so when I was doing cleaning by myself like I was the company
B	yeah yeah
C	cos the company had folded
B	yeah
C	cos I was helping all of these old ladies
B	yeah
C	and they said well actually erm sort of self-employed but
B	yeah
C	oh yes I got a phone call I love I don't really love phone calls but sometimes it amuses me and this fellow was a foreign sounding voice said ah the government has chosen you erm
B	this was a phone call
C	this was on the phone call yes madam and I said aw you must be wrong the UK government doesn't have money
C	not give it to me but but say thank you very much from me bye bye
C	cos they're just wanting your bank details
B	yeah they do yeah
B	that's quite funny
C	aw I love it when I can sort of do a con back on them
C	I've told them not to because well he's learned not to one time
C	well I think she just learned that that was his birthday that day and she was trying to be friendly
B	aw I see right was she?
C	I don't know I don't know why she phoned him
B	I'd find that really scary
B	oh yeah
C	it's the hospital
B	aw okay
C	so he he he waits to hear what they say
B	yeah
C	before he starts shouting
C	erm I I I mean I hope nobody else was conned by that phone call you know?
B	people people will they do all sorts of scams don't they?
C	erm but er but I thought what a silly scam
B	yeah
C	it wasn't for reroofing your house or putting in erm
B	yeah
C	anything no no I can spend it on anything I like
B	god
C	just a great lottery it
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	and erm he said and you have to press this start button or something and I said I can't find it now I can find the alphabet?
C	which one do you want me to press?
C	knowing full well
C	erm I think they put down the phone number then erm mm
B	yeah
C	so
B	yeah well there's lots of bloody scams about
C	but usually I just thank them very kindly and just say no thank you
B	you get quite a few calls actually you do don't you? you and
B	yeah
C	and sometimes they say oh my children don't allow me to do to answer any questions you know?
B	see even if you got taken off some of the lists and all those scam ones there I mean they're they're outside the system aren't they? so they won't be abiding by any rules
C	well seemingly people who are on like erm
B	mm
B	yeah
C	but it's because erm
D	what?
B	are you okay? what are you doing there?
B	hello
C	people put the phone down they can't really run their businesses properly because
C	when
B	yeah
C	it just people just think they're
B	yeah
C	erm
B	oh right
B	yeah
C	erm erm are are are feeling the pinch badly because there's so many people won't reply to them
B	yeah
B	mm
C	and there loads of charities
B	mm
C	they can they
B	mm
C	I think that's I think that's dreadful
B	I know cos you know? some of them it's very difficult cos they might have a box but it's very difficult to find which box it is and that kind of the little box you tick or not tick
C	mm
B	but still I don't think that's enough but they but they are going to be clamped down upon quite heavily apparently aren't they? erm charities are not going to be able to cold call or all sorts
C	you know? that's not a good way of charities getting money and just
B	yeah but apparently there's going to be lots more regulations going in cos I saw on
D	seven
B	seven
D	oh
C	this Friday you're allowed to go to sleep Friday night
