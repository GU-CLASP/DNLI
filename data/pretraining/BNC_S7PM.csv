A	I've been reliving our previous conversations
B	that must be very er surreal actually
A	it's
B	it's like this sounds familiar
A	it's it's interesting to see how I interact and
B	yes cos you're analysing yourself
A	yeah
B	aren't you?
A	but I'm I seem to vary a lot sometimes I sound really confident and other times absolutely a bit of a social disaster
B	but you erm
A	and
B	you can't put tone of voice in can you? in the recordings can you?
A	no no
B	right
A	for the thing
B	you can't put in brackets she says with great confidence?
A	no
A	but managed to do a few with
B	oh right
A	but with
A	yeah
B	right
A	and I think they only need ten million so must be nearing the end of it
B	does that no no but but is your contract on a number of words or the times that
A	no well contract's on till I've got till the end of April at the moment
B	right
A	it keeps being renewed
B	mm
A	yeah it always does
A	I it's just
A	get the money in while I can
A	but sometimes I yeah I've had to resist doing it cos I've started thinking hearing a conversation and thinking god I wish I was recording that
B	yeah it's so erm so actually we're we're paying paying rent in words which I think
A	you are
B	is rather lovely isn't it?
A	all you have to do is talk and that's
B	yeah
A	just fantastic
B	I'll pay you in words
A	but
A	he facilitated it so
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	it's fantastic cos it's kind of life changing in a
B	oh yeah not
A	well yeah it's one of those things that
B	or a fully functional one
A	it works so well and
B	yeah
A	oh it's just brilliant
B	well
A	crappy loo with
B	well the thing is if you've got if you've got the skills
A	yeah
B	to do it
A	and you know how simple it is to do
B	mm then you kind of can't resist can you?
A	no I'd be like that if I had his skills everything would just be done if I had
B	yeah why would you
A	his skills
B	put up with something?
A	you wouldn't you wouldn't even have to wait for stuff you'd just do it
B	well yeah except then like
A	oh
B	and there's literally not enough time
A	yeah
B	yeah cos he won't pay someone else to do it you see
A	I know
B	says why should I pay someone else when I can do it myself?
A	well yes he was saying that
B	but did he tell you plumbing is his least favourite thing?
A	no he didn't
B	yeah
A	no I didn't know it was his most least favouritest thing er
B	not that at all it's terribly complicated if the plumbing's already there you know it's just a case of
A	yeah
B	reconnecting another one
A	but I think it's probably just worse for guests than it is for us having a dodgy toilet
A	you know
B	yeah yeah
A	yes so
B	and nobody wants to use the toilet cos you can't get rid of what
A	no
A	what you've left behind
B	mm
B	yes the other one you felt there was a certain way that you had to erm
A	it was absolute technique
B	you know
A	that you had to know
B	all in the wrist action
A	yeah
B	mm
A	are you finished?
B	I've got erm one more day I've got tomorrow
A	oh right
B	erm so it's actually tomorrow morning but what I'm gonna do I'm working in
A	yeah
B	is really it's really challenging so I thought I'd just shoot in
A	yeah
B	in theory
A	do you want to do your own milk?
B	thank you then I've got to go from
A	mm
B	and I'm going home
A	at last
B	mm yes
A	well it'll be nice but it's been okay having people come and go
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	mm
A	so cos she's very entertaining and fun and happy and everything
B	she was showing me pictures of her place in erm Greece last night
A	oh was she?
B	well I think she'd been talking to
A	yes
B	had had has
A	oh god
B	she
B	and she wants us to go to see her
A	yes
B	it does look beautiful
A	oh I'm sure yeah it well you should if you want to
B	and the thought of having a ten-minute
A	go
B	a one-minute walk down the road
A	yeah
B	and to be able to go swimming
A	well I I I mean I'm intending to go at some point when it's when we can do it cheaply enough
B	no but I said to her I said why why are you here when when
A	yeah
B	cos it's sixteen degrees out there at the moment
A	I think she's got sort of medical stuff to deal with as well
B	right
A	but I mean she often is there so
B	no I know I know what you mean I think well I can't be that that
B	normally
A	yeah but I mean it's really bad that I think that but I do think that I think oh how could you maintain such happiness but she just does she is just happy
A	a happy person
B	of being actively happy it's a case of just not letting the bad things that happen
A	no she no she doesn't because whereas
B	mm
A	around but it doesn't affect her
B	but also cos there was a kind of acceptance cos she's saying to me we she was talking about how
A	yes
B	and erm said then
A	mm
B	you do when you get to a certain age and erm
A	mm
B	and she said she was joking with the nurses cos she was saying well I should think er it's working
A	yeah
B	but then there was also kind of a sense of well if it's that's what's gonna happen that's what's gonna happen so
A	and that's what
B	and there's no
A	that's why she's still here as well is cos er
B	yeah there's no point
A	an incredible er positivity or
B	it's just you do what you need to do cos there's if you can't change something
A	yeah
B	there's no
A	yeah
B	mm I suppose although she did take it very well when she told me how they'd completely missed it in the UK and she you know she was about to go on holiday and and the the doctor said oh erm
A	right
B	and if they hadn't found it in Greece
A	yes
B	it could have really
A	yeah
B	I mean it was pretty far gone
A	that would have been curtains
B	as it was and you kind of think I would be really angry about that
A	yeah
B	there's some incompetent doctor
A	but then
B	and you nearly die
A	on on the other hand the anger would is would not do the cancer any good
B	no
A	so even then
B	no
A	even then
B	but I suppose
A	you need sort of somehow process it in a different way
B	yeah but it's like you use your anger to
A	mm
B	shouldn't happen to anybody
A	yeah the
B	it doesn't need to happen
A	yeah
B	you know it's not
A	no no
B	it's bad enough having cancer but having someone that's not bothered to
A	but I would
B	diagnose it
A	I would expect it and I think our NXS NHS is brilliant but I don't expect
B	but if it's something internal how are you supposed to know?
A	yeah but I wouldn't trust them even if they said I don't I never do
B	mm
A	but I I wouldn't rely on what they I I actually I wouldn't rely on what a doctor told me really but it's kind of more in in the ball's in your court but you go and kind of use them
B	mm
A	in a way but erm
B	yes I suppose you could insist like no I like when you know
A	erm
B	because then then you say well do I cancel my holiday?
A	well no but
B	because I need to have this test or
A	it's just that I hear a lot of well in transcribing as well but there is a lot of passitivity passivity
B	mm
A	with medical stuff and people talk like oh and I've got this and the doctor said that
B	yeah
A	think that maybe
B	yeah
A	kind of proactivity on it
B	yeah
A	there seems to be just an acceptance and
B	but also
A	mm
B	expecting doctors to be like
A	yes
B	magicians
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	no I mean they're just people
B	they should cure me and
A	yeah
B	it's as simple as that it's that you know
A	well they gave me a pill and he said this and it's like what?
B	mm
A	they can't
B	yeah
A	they can't know not really
B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah
A	no
B	we're led to believe it is
A	exactly
B	so there's a bit of detective work involved
A	completely and it's all
B	erm
A	it's all a bit random really
B	yes and it's a lot of it is luck whether they
A	and plus all the stuff they don't know about probably
B	yeah
A	so it's all
B	oh right
A	conspiracy theory to
B	mm
A	take the control away cos also the control has kind of I think there's more control than we know I just think there is
B	yeah
A	but it's just
B	well yeah
A	an instinct
B	mm
A	and I can't prove that
B	yeah
A	and you you can never battle with science either because they in conspiracy-speak have science on their side
B	yes and they know stuff that's
A	that I don't
B	that we are not supposed to know so therefore we should
A	and it's provable and it's only stuff that's provable that is there
B	mm
A	and anything outside of that
B	mm
A	and the whole thing is based on diet the whole diabetes thing is diet
B	yeah
A	it's just it doesn't come about type two it is purely that
B	well they
A	mad
B	they treat symptoms don't they? they don't
A	mm
B	erm I mean they don't have a holistic approach where they go look at the whole lifestyle
A	yeah
B	and the body and everything and go
A	mm
B	how are you living your life? it would be
A	but that's to do with the individual that needs to understand that there's an element of responsibility
B	there are probably a lot of doctors themselves don't even
A	oh no
B	know how to live their lives
A	and smoke and drink
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
B	yes it's like if something's if something's not working properly you can just treat that and
A	mm
B	try and make it work properly
A	fix it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	isn't it? cos they
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	it's a bit odd isn't it?
B	hang on but no one's got any money so
B	yeah and it's crammed full to people
A	then it's like where are they all getting the money from?
B	yes
A	and I'm thinking I don't have any money to spend here and it's packed
B	yeah
A	with people spending loads of money and bags and stuff and they're they don't look like they've got loads of money but they're there spending it and so what what's going on?
B	yes I I find that a bit of a mystery
A	it's really odd
B	I must admit yeah
A	yeah
B	and also probably a good ninety percent of what they're buying is stuff they don't actually need
A	I would say at least ninety percent yeah
B	which is
A	I mean that is a conspiracy because that's what makes the world go round so
B	so we we're all having to keep working
A	yeah
B	in order to earn this money to buy stuff that we don't actually really need
A	yeah
A	but you have to be
B	we don't have time to do anything else
A	it's quite you have to be quite strong to step out of it and realise that it's a conspiracy really it is a conspiracy
B	mm and if there's a bit of wasteland or a bit of anything people build build shops on it
A	mm gotta do something with it haven't you? yeah
B	and when when there aren't enough cheap homes so it's like well
A	yeah
B	build cheap homes and and basic shops that people need? and schools
A	yeah
B	and a hospital things that people need to live their lives
A	mm
B	erm and meeting places and you know community centres and places where people can can get together and and do activities if they want to and things that build community rather than
A	mm
B	shops which are like horrible spooky ghost towns in the evenings when they shut
A	yeah and they're an alternative reality though there's that element
B	mm
A	but you do have to step out well I don't know I wonder what it would be like if you had enough money I'm just stepping out of it cos I don't have any
B	yeah
A	what would it be like if you did?
B	well it depends what you mean by enough though cos
A	mm
B	cos if you
A	yeah
B	expect to have a fleet of helicopters and and
A	mm
B	entourage to to look after everything that you need and so you would have to spend a lot of money to maintain that so it's a completely different set of expectations isn't it? so
A	yeah but I never feel poor but I've I've always been poor but
B	mm
A	I don't feel poor
B	no I know what you no
A	it's
B	no
A	you've got a house it's
B	no
B	yes
A	cos of that
B	mm
A	I'm trying to grab cash as well wherever I can really
B	yeah
A	you know
B	but it's like but then we're all
A	mm
B	living lifestyles that you know
B	mm
A	but they couldn't step out of it
B	yeah because you're terrified you don't want to sacrifice your own children you think if we let them
A	mm
B	just stray and do their own thing
A	or nothing
B	and and they
A	or even worse do nothing
B	yeah
B	yeah then somehow
B	you know what if they then can't look after themselves and after the parents have died or whatever what are they gonna do if they can't look after
A	well
B	themselves?
A	this was this was our parents this is my parents to me
B	mm
A	er and I do I did grow up and see their point but erm and it is there's this big blank when you're sixteen
A	there was a lot of er
B	trying to convince their children to
A	actually exertion of pressure on and he was handling it very well the
B	can you but you don't actually really appreciate
A	no but on the other that it doesn't
B	thank you
A	matter rung a few bells with me because I remember asking the same question and sort of like oh you don't ask that
B	no no
A	what was what was that all about?
B	particularly
A	you're my mother
B	yeah
A	or my father
B	yeah
A	what?
B	it's considered a very personal question isn't it what you earn
A	but it's like yeah but
B	yeah
A	for having asked and oh dear I've sinned suddenly
B	mm
A	individuals and whatnot and
B	yeah
A	er but
B	I mean I guess cos I've got a friend er who I work with a lot and she's got two children who they're a bit older than
A	mm
B	she got a very good degree but then she decided she wanted to travel and she went off to Australia for a couple of years now she's coming back she's trying to get work and finding it really hard cos
A	well it is
B	people have to be interns for
A	yeah
B	and work for no money for ages
A	it's really hard
B	but her son who's a couple of years younger he's always been a bit of a daydreamer and it
A	yeah
B	very intelligent but doesn't actually like to
A	mm
B	apply himself
A	yeah
B	and he's erm he kind of flunked his A levels for the first time and he retook them anyway he eventually ended up he's now in his final year at university so he's he's
A	mm
B	and he's like she doesn't know but she thinks he could be on the on er on the verge of a breakdown and he just wants to chuck the whole thing in and
A	what's he doing? something that he doesn't like or
B	er he's doing languages
A	right
B	which he's very good at
A	okay yeah
B	erm but but she's kind of just really scared for him now because he's twenty-three
A	mm
B	and she's going and I don't know how he's going to he seems to be
A	survive
B	completely out of touch with the world because
A	yeah
B	if he drops out he won't get any grant he he will literally be kind of destitute
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	she keeps you know ringing him and he's there is a counsellor he could go and see at university and she says you must go and see and and get get some support
A	yes
B	don't just
A	yeah
B	don't turn up because everyone'll just cut
A	yeah
B	and she's she's just just really scared for him and says
A	yeah
B	she has sleepless night of it but but she can't it's his life now
A	you can't do anything
B	but she says to have to stand by and just
A	watch it it's like watching
B	you know
A	a car crash happen yeah
B	and then so we were talking about it and I was saying and I
A	yeah
B	oh there isn't a safety net I'm going to have to find a way of managing my life somehow
A	they either sink or swim
B	yeah or they go under which
A	yeah
B	must be awful
A	if
A	and we all want that in the end
B	but you see but that's such a a it's all
A	well
B	I mean being
A	well
B	being able to
A	I think
B	and buy
A	in
B	designer clothes and you know what is
A	yeah
B	what is it?
A	whole lifestyle package and
B	is you have your your children
A	I think how dare you you know it's a life
B	yeah
A	how dare you make that decision on that basis? it's so crap
B	mm
B	just having an accessory isn't it? oh
B	do I have a dog? shall I have a dog or
A	just and thoughtless but of course I don't know I I'm I'm only speaking on what I think I don't know what the ins and outs of it are
B	mm
A	and no wonder they just think that you're gonna
B	let's just perpetuate the whole thing
A	but they
B	the parents that you knew
A	the parents that I knew
A	had some values and I never really understood what they were but I knew that I was a source of fear and something they weren't happy with because I really wasn't going anywhere
B	yeah
B	mm it's the chicken and egg isn't it?
A	it didn't get any support so anything that I might have been wouldn't have
B	yeah
A	become anything erm and
B	yeah but
A	but but on the other hand I think that
B	he's got a different gets of genes
A	yeah
B	I I don't know er
A	well
B	the way his mind works is very
A	well we've all got we've got different
B	mm
A	genes but I I think that if you're set on money it would have been alright so we're
B	but alright in what sense? alright in that your parents think that it's
B	yeah but I dunno if that makes you alright as a
A	well that that that that means that
B	I mean generally
A	you can have a conversation with them but if you're not
B	yeah
A	anywhere near those values which I wasn't then you can't even
B	mm
A	you don't have any bridge at all
B	yeah it's really really painful isn't it? until you're actually old enough to erm just be who you're gonna be and say well you either take me as I am or not at all and you can't do that when you're a teenager you just haven't got the the confidence or the the strength to do that have you?
A	well
B	well very er very
A	mm
B	completely destroying them to to have their parents reject
A	mm
B	who they are they might pretend it doesn't matter but
A	it's so fundamental though
B	yeah
A	and it is terrible
B	I mean I've noticed certainly about teenagers now there's there's an awful lot of sort of
A	mm yeah
B	you you
B	cos they're different
A	oh okay
B	they're different from when they're on their own
A	yeah
B	what they'll say and the way they'll react and everything so
A	mm
B	it's a lot of I'm not going to admit that anything is I'm fragile or anything
A	right
B	if my friend's there
A	yeah oh yeah
B	so that's another pressure that they're they're they're they've got because they can't appear to be weak in front of their contemporaries
A	mm oh
B	there's
A	well I don't know what that's like now I can't I yeah depends who they're hanging out with and who they are I suppose as well I just hung out with a few other rejects so it was
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	not exactly rejects but
B	no it's
A	in a kind of
A	bravo way
B	yeah a flippant kind of way
B	and I thought no I've seen you in floods of tears
A	yeah
B	when you've got you know
B	and
A	were there other people there?
B	yeah there were other people there so she couldn't be seen to kind of
A	mm
B	or either that or actually she'd done alright but it was kind of cool to go oh I was a disaster
A	yeah
B	kind of thing
A	mm
B	so so you kind of have to play a
B	well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	okay
A	mm
B	mm
B	yes
A	oh they're alright I think they'll survive
B	I well it's early days
B	it's early days
A	mm
B	also you can get away with so much when you're young people forgive you so much I mean the world
A	mm
B	I'm not sure about your parents would say
A	yeah
B	but the world does
A	mm
B	erm they they you get lots of chances I think when you're young but once you get to a certain age
A	yeah after a certain point it's true
B	people don't
A	it's a real struggle yeah that's
B	and when you stop looking young as well
B	I no I've really er
A	mm
B	noticed people react to you differently
A	well I knew that as soon as I wasn't sort of drop dead gorgeous any more I was still alright but you know not that sort of immediacy thing
B	yeah
A	and I lost all my power
B	yeah it's the energy of youth isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it just kind of has this glow about it
A	but I didn't have to do anything you just sit there being pretty and that's your career
B	yeah
A	that's all you have to do you don't have to say anything and you don't have to have a personality you don't have to it's enough
B	I know the trouble is you don't realise at the time that that's what
A	no
B	cos cos I just thought
A	cos everyone's kind of tiptoeing around you and letting you pass cos
B	yeah
A	and
B	but I kind of thought I was just you know lucky with getting jobs and stuff
A	mm
B	and then I look back and I think actually it's probably
A	because you were pretty
B	that my looks had something to do with it yeah
B	okay I could probably
A	yeah
B	just about do the job otherwise I probably wouldn't have got it but I'm sure
A	mm
B	the way I looked had a lot to do with and
A	mm
B	and suddenly it's like well I haven't got that any more so
A	no I know it's
B	so so it's er
A	but that yes well I I er I had a very early experience of that because the sort of immediacy of the sort of Lolita phase kind of passed and that was quite shocking you know
B	mm
A	but cos mm men just used to be like
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	I didn't have to do anything I was accepted for that
B	and we don't we don't realise how much
A	mm
B	you react to that is
A	mm
B	physical attraction to it in whatever way whether it's a dog or a cat or
A	yes
B	you know
A	it's very fickle isn't it?
B	you don't it's really much harder to er love an ugly cat
A	mm
B	than it is a pretty cat isn't it?
A	it's really unfair isn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm yeah we love the pretty ones don't we?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and we
A	seems to be deeply unfair I
B	yeah
A	but on the other hand
B	but
A	when you're all with your contemporaries when you're young er it's just another set of it's all relative so I I'll look at young people now and I think oh so beautiful but actually probably when I was younger I wouldn't think they were
B	no
A	no
B	no no
B	you you don't you don't you don't understand the erm the kind of the
A	the pure
B	magnetic force
A	no
B	of just just youth yeah
A	so
B	yeah and so
A	mm
B	recognise that it's only
A	yeah
B	when you get older that you go
A	yeah
B	wow
A	yeah
B	look at that it's just because
A	mm
B	mainly cos they're young
A	yeah
B	you know and it's er
A	it's like a power
B	yeah Oscar Wilde was right when he said youth is wasted on the young
A	it is so wasted
A	cos I think god sixteen?
B	yes I'm ancient
A	and I do remember the mummy saying that a lot of times she used to say oh I think it's too late now for you to learn blah blah blah
A	if I it was either piano or you know dancing or whatever
B	oh well yeah she
A	gosh
B	she's she's a quitter though isn't she? she kind of like doesn't
A	yeah
B	anything that seems like too much trouble
A	yeah
B	oh that that will take far too much much energy and effort so let's not not bother with that
A	oh god
B	but the yeah the irony is if she'd said yes of course give it a try you might have decided well that's not for me anyway but you would have tried and you would have gone
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah but I
B	or you might not but but you'd have
A	I can't keep blaming though I do still blame them
B	yeah
A	they came right in the end well did they? don't know they lent me the money for this house that was good I'm very grateful for that
B	they gave you the money didn't they?
A	they gave me it yeah it's sort of yeah
A	I know
B	because there won't be any money left so you've
A	yeah but I know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no yeah we were having a conversation about them cos the the their
A	what's
B	they've had very few viewings no nobody's made any offers
A	but why? is it just
B	well we don't know
A	not the time?
B	you see we were erm
A	it's a nice flat
A	away with with
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so erm we kind of talked about and we thought maybe try putting it on with two agents and
A	yeah
B	thing cos none of us is down there so it's quite hard and and and
A	it is on Rightmove and stuff?
B	oh yeah yeah
A	that's weird
B	so erm and the other thing we thought we'd do is we'd get cos we all ended up erm after the party going going back there it was the twins' suggestion actually cos we were saying
A	mm
B	let's just have a look at it and we all went back there and we we cleared a lot of stuff actually
A	mm it might look a bit sad actually
B	well
B	erm we it had a lot of personal stuff in which
A	yes
B	I think was putting people off so
A	yeah
B	we we got rid of a lot a lot and erm
A	mm
B	looking a bit grubby and we weren't sure about the pictures cos they make it look very personal so maybe it's hardly for
A	mm
B	and we kept couldn't make up our minds whether it was better with or without the pictures but the latest thing we're thinking is take all the pictures down get the walls repaired so they haven't got empty hooks and just
A	yeah
B	give it a coat of paint just to
A	that really works wonders
B	so it's a bit of a neutral space not take all the furniture out
A	yeah it's
B	but just make it
A	so off-putting when something's got
B	yeah
A	a kind of
B	yeah
A	a little bit sad as well that's really it's slightly spooky so it's off-putting
B	yeah yes there was a lot of personal things I mean the and things just being left
A	oh god
B	biscuits mouldering in a biscuit tin you know the I mean there so it's
A	mm
B	kind of
A	yeah
B	and we went through the wardrobe and erm sorted out the clothes ones that she might want at the care home and ones that definitely
A	mm
B	you know
A	well it would have a reek of of sort of not a physical smell but it kind of would
B	you wouldn't help wondering has the person died who lived here
A	well it's a thick atmosphere
B	yeah
A	to walk through and
B	yeah
A	yeah and
B	yeah but erm
A	erm but I mean a good whitewash yeah a neutral space just made and some flowers and made presentable and stuff
B	yeah so so we've asked
A	mm
B	but erm it's a bit odd actually cos she offered to do that and I've I've I sort of emailed on behalf of everyone else and then I said oh I'll give you a call cos I thought I'd rather than just by email just give her a call and check that that's okay erm and I can't get through there's been no answer of on their home number so I hope everything's alright
A	mm when did you call?
B	er last night and I tried again today I've left messages on her voicemail I don't think I've got her mobile
A	mm
B	but erm and I've emailed so I can't really do much more but
A	yeah that needs to be can't one of us
B	well I mean
A	I'm not a great painter but
A	well I mean
B	oh god if you could it would be brilliant actually
A	I'll ask
B	I mean and if you don't actually want to do it just organise somebody
A	but we could do it ourselves couldn't we if it's just I mean I don't wanna say anything cos I'm probably crap at er DIY and stuff but if it's just painting
B	well it would be the the hooks the picture hooks will need
A	just need filling
B	filling in
A	yeah
B	so the walls are made good
A	can do that
B	and then
A	know how to do that
B	we just thought a a coat of paint cos it'll look a bit you know then walls get a bit grubby when you take the pictures off
A	just whitewash paint cheap paint
B	and then get get carpet cleaners in to clean all the
A	yeah
B	carpets erm
A	well I I'll have a word with
B	cos we were we were trying to work out
A	we'd have to sleep in there probably
B	well that's it you see it needs somebody who's got a few days free to go down there and do it all
A	yeah it would have to be organised wouldn't it?
B	erm and
A	but if it's gonna help get the thing shifted cos
B	yeah
A	it's a terrible thing to be hanging around
B	also we we were we were trying to work out how much money she's got left we reckon she's probably got about another year's worth of money left
A	yeah
B	before she's gonna run
A	yeah well I don't know what happens when when that happens when she runs out of money
B	well evidently once you've used all your money up the council will pay a certain amount towards it but because that that place is so expensive
A	yeah
B	what the council will pay will not cover it
A	no of course not
B	so either someone has to make the shortfall up or she has to move to a cheaper place
A	oh
B	and a move would just be a er that would kill her
A	and also she's used to living like a queen it would absolutely kill her
B	yeah so er
A	no and
B	and also she actually is very happy there now you can tell
C	hi
A	oh yeah
B	hello
A	yeah I'm sure
B	she's got her routine and she didn't cough once the entire party
A	no yeah
B	apart from when she blew the candles out which anyone would cough if they did that
A	yeah
B	but you know all this kind of oh I've got this awful cough you know she's she just didn't
A	no she's she's well gotta get rid of the flat no it just needs like this place was just whitewashed
B	mm
A	and it's just neutral so you can see
B	yeah
C	oh
A	you can see
B	yeah
A	I mean even on Rightmove if it's kind of got personal artefacts
C	hello
B	yeah
A	and things that's so off-putting
B	hello
A	hello
C	I got boshed on the stairway
B	what from the cat?
A	yes
C	he likes boshing you through the
B	oh
A	I like to think of it as
C	bannisters
A	a blessing
A	he goes bosh
C	a little bosh
A	yeah
C	well he wants some food oh
A	and actually just needs to be cleared of all the stuff really
B	well
A	beforehand
B	what what what we've done is we took all the stuff that we we know is of value and that we wouldn't want to be lost and we put you know that that like coat cupboard?
A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	all all the stuff that definitely
A	yeah
B	mustn't be given away or whatever has all gone in there
A	yeah
B	erm and then there was a whole load of stuff in the spare bedroom which was for the charity shop which
A	okay
B	erm and then we've left the the furniture in there at the moment cos we weren't we weren't sure whether it's better to take that out cos we could
A	no a little bit of furniture
B	get rid of the furniture
A	is good because even if it's not great furniture but actually no but you might be right the right sort of furniture is could be
B	yeah because then we discussed and thought well if we're gonna do the walls cos you know they've got those kind of like reproduction Victorian light fittings on the walls?
A	I can't remember but anyway
B	oh but but they're really kind of like
A	yeah
B	and I just wondered if er if we changed those for something slightly more contemporary erm
A	but then again the person who's gonna move in there
B	well exactly they might want it exactly so
A	is gonna be old for a start it could just be smartened up and spruced up
B	yeah
A	couldn't it?
B	or it could be just that the agents aren't doing a very good job of
A	but the first point of call is Rightmove for most people and
B	well I think
A	if those photos look awful
B	I haven't seen the photos
A	yeah we need to look at those
B	but
A	well we could even make get our own photos done and give them to the agencies
B	well that's what
A	make it look really lovely
B	cos evidently the first photo of the place outside had a whopping great red truck parked in front of it
A	well
B	so
A	well
B	yeah
A	you know
B	well if you've got the time to do it
A	you just make
B	yeah
A	yeah it's just the time thing erm
B	cos it needs a block of time it's not something you can do in one day
A	it does need a block of time to sort of
B	you can just erm
A	whitewash it
B	I don't know if the carpet cleaner
A	do some good photos
B	when you'd need to bring in
A	yeah
B	and you need really need a car to transport it if you're gonna do it yourself cos I think you can hire them
A	yeah we can't do anything that involves a car but
B	no
A	but if it's just someone coming over
B	but but
A	mm
B	and then yeah making sure the place is looking as good as it can
A	yeah it's easy to talk but I don't mind the prospect of just coming and
B	no cos it's it's difficult if you're
A	time so
B	if you're working full time I mean it's I mean that's the and also a lot of us aren't based down there
A	no
B	so it's
A	well you it probably takes about a week it think probably about a week's worth of
B	yeah
A	but that sounds very doable though all that
B	well it should yeah
B	erm in theory
A	and erm just no clutter and clutter's the off-putting thing just er cos this place just had the odd table yeah the odd bit of furniture
B	mm
A	and it was all whitewashed and it looked really good
B	yeah
A	but it was nothing special but it did look really good
B	but you can imagine what
A	cos it was neutralised
B	you might be able to do with it yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah cos I remember when we went to see that flat and there was no furniture in it and it seemed quite spacious
A	yeah?
B	I remember walking around it
A	well maybe
B	and er
A	maybe take the furniture out I just think the odd bit of furniture is good er a nice
B	yeah I mean it's going
A	you can't do like
B	yeah you have to be over fifty-five to erm to live there
A	yeah
A	sort of like really
B	oh we we can do it
B	yeah
A	kind of
B	well when they first moved in I kind of thought particularly cos where they've got the dining table and it all the crumbs were dropping on the carpet and everything
A	mm
B	and I thought it would be really nice to put a parquet floor down
A	yeah
B	that but evidently you're not allowed to though cos of the noise it has to be
A	right
B	carpet but erm which is a shame but you could as erm
A	okay is that
B	so if your
A	like erm
B	yes
A	but there's it's nice I really like those
B	yeah it's
A	yeah
B	but it's very neutral colours it's the
A	mm
B	it's kid of the next best thing
A	yeah
B	cos then you could put rugs on top if you want but it's so
A	it's probably not it's just a matter of
B	but then that's us perhaps an old
A	neutralising thing
B	older person
A	and some it would show off the paintings nicely or the pictures nicely if they had we could maybe change a few pictures and choose something
B	yeah well I mean we were we we rethinking yeah just take all rather than have have any pictures up just take them all down
A	yeah
B	and just have
A	mirrors are good
B	yes cos they reflect the light
A	yeah
B	and
A	I remember this place had a lot of mirrors in it er
B	so someone was quite skilful then
A	yeah definitely cos there was nothing to get offended by and in fact we could just move I straight away and not be offended really
B	right
A	there was nothing that needed changing
B	mm
A	so we could still be
B	apart from the toilet
A	yeah
A	but we could still be living in it how it was
B	yes yeah
A	and it would still be okay
B	yeah
A	be livable in so
B	mm
A	then
B	well
A	I'd have to approach it like
B	well you just need someone that to it's quite hard to yeah
A	well I don't I can't do the painting on my own I'm not great with DIY so
B	but also how would you
A	well that's the other thing I don't know
B	yeah but maybe
A	yeah
B	maybe when when
A	let me have a little think
B	yeah but I could I could if you did want to I could say
A	mm
B	erm oh
A	mm
B	you two can can confer that way rather than
A	possibly
B	yeah
C	does it need it?
A	yeah apparently well it's not selling so we need to make it look neutralised and nice it's
B	the carpets need cleaning as well they're very grubby
A	and take some better photographs of it so that they can sell it and so that my mum's
C	I wonder could ditch the furniture
A	but I
B	I mean it might be your your your time's better spent supervising somebody else to do it
A	mm yeah
B	because getting people around to do the quotes that could all be done from here
A	mm
B	and then just be there on the day when people come
A	yeah that's not a problem
B	erm
A	sit down the stairs with a cup of tea and stuff and go out and then come back again and things
B	yeah just be there to let people in and
A	yeah no that's absolutely no problem at all
B	and it's the same with the carpet cleaning just sort of
A	yeah
B	get someone in to say you know
C	whatever you want me to do
B	cos that's that's that's that's one of the things that need doing you see which
A	oh yeah
B	but but someone needs to er get people in to give quotes
A	yeah
B	that's one of the things that needs doing
A	oh so that's another thing so
B	well that's the first thing that needs to happen
A	so they need to come over for that
B	yeah
A	you're saying so that's two trips
B	well that yes so possibly it might just be worth you then if you liaise with with
A	mm
B	then somebody obviously will need to be around to check the work and and then then rearrange
A	no cos I I was thinking in terms of being there for the work
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and so be there to let them in and
A	and
B	do all the the rest but erm
A	yeah okay
B	or whatever erm
A	mm
B	mm
C	I've put your coffee in here
B	oh right oh okay lovely thank you
C	no
C	has he not had supper?
A	no
C	oh darling
B	he was eating something earlier
B	yes yeah
A	so you know because it obviously causes stress and everything and I can feel as you're talking about it sort of stress levels rising and let's just get rid of it
B	yeah no
A	you know?
B	it has to
A	you is but
B	er it's something that has to be done and as you say yeah the sooner we do it the
A	yeah but we'll just do it
B	mm but it doesn't have to be kind of something has to be done
A	it does have to be done
B	mm
A	but so yeah that's why I think it needs to be yes done so that it's not there any more
C	right you don't mind if I turn in do you?
B	no I was thinking the same myself actually cos I've got to be up quite early tomorrow
C	are you here tonight?
B	yes
B	no I'm I'm working then I'm coming back to get my stuff and then I'm going cos I've got to stay very close to
C	how was
C	yeah
C	go out on the tiles?
B	no no
B	no but they're a very nice people
C	look at
A	oh stop it
C	sorry
A	yes dear
C	gosh they've got it right cos they made a mistake last time
B	I had some sausages
A	I nibbled
