A	shall we stop for some dinner at
B	I don't know what
A	must be an area probably
B	I mean I maybe there is an inn like or there was
A	do you think they've named it after the book?
B	no I think the book is based on the area
A	have you read it?
B	no I've got it though
A	have you?
B	yeah
A	I always thought it was kinda some pirate story
B	no it's erm
A	well it sounds like that
B	yeah I'm not sure what that one's about
B	I don't think that's a very Daphne du Maurier thing to write
A	are you like some aficionado of road surfaces then?
B	no
A	nice clear road this is
B	is the Wizard of Oz a book? or is it a play?
A	I don't know
B	cos I thought it might
A	it was a film
B	yeah but I thought it might be a novel but I think it's a play
A	no I'm not sure
B	mm
A	that's
A	we're driving alongside
B	oh yeah oh we were talking about this it might be I'm not sure
B	well one or the other
A	oh yeah?
B	yeah
A	I thought you'd read them all
B	well I have
A	oh I don't remember being any confusion but I I thought it was quite er
B	yeah well the
A	maybe I just didn't look at it too detailed like you are
B	because like
A	you mean when the person who's saying right this is what happened but you're going back?
B	yeah
A	well it's so he's
B	yeah but it's just confusing cos there's like direct speech within that
A	mm
B	cos I remember in erm
A	yeah I can't remember now
A	I know I have read books where they just go off like that and you think what?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't remember
B	yeah cos I yeah cos I read like quite a lot of them a while ago and I remember like enjoying them but not kind of
A	yeah
B	cos of the way it's done cos it's kind of almost like
A	well I don't think he necessarily wrote it as a novel type thing did he?
B	no yeah
A	they were really made for a magazine and they they were a series weren't they?
B	yeah
A	so that probably has an effect on how it
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	you just
B	yeah that's what I did
A	yeah
B	and I just kind of went through
A	yeah
B	and then now
A	well you know
B	yeah
A	to
B	so
A	I don't know whether it there is the death there is it that you want to
B	yeah
A	well yeah I don't think it really is there no
B	yeah
A	it it there's clever little things in there you know?
B	yeah
A	and some of them you think well
B	it is well done yeah
A	er
B	yeah I liked him like Sherlock Holmes like kind of the
A	he he eliminates everything that's like impossible or whatever
B	yeah
A	I quite liked when I read that sentence that stands out cos it's quite
B	yeah
A	just cleverly put together to explain it how he
B	yeah
A	and then there's other things where
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah yeah it's good
A	it's a bit far fetched some of it like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	stuff like it is good the way he figures it out isn't it?
B	yeah
A	not that you could necessarily figure it out from that but
B	yeah
A	the way he explains it you're thinking
B	yeah it's like wow
A	well no but
A	but it would give you the idea of how determined you were
B	yeah
A	you can put the clues together that
B	yeah
A	and that's kind of what he does so
B	I like in this erm Sign Of the Four one they were like oh but how did they get in? the window and the the window's locked
A	well I brought the Sherlock Holmes that
B	oh did you?
A	just in case you wanted to watch them I know you've seen them before but erm
B	the new one's out the you know that one? that one that looked quite good on the trailer?
A	oh right yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah it might be interesting that mightn't it?
B	yeah
A	he's he's like in old age isn't he?
B	yeah
A	and is he a bit forgetful about
B	I'm not sure
A	yeah
B	cos his mind
A	is that the
B	yeah I think it's in
A	yeah
B	and it's like you you have to keep only the things that he wants and like he forgets the things that he doesn't need
A	yeah
B	and it and it's like how can you forget something? that you don't want
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like ahead of his time
B	but it's it's strange that like you could think him up do you know what I mean if you weren't a similar sort of person
A	yeah
B	it'd be quite hard to write that I think
A	mm
B	I don't really know
A	I don't think he was
B	no
A	friends with have you heard of Houdini?
B	yeah
A	and he went once I think
B	maybe
A	that it exists
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah there was loads of like fakes then
B	yeah
A	or am I thinking of Lewis Carroll I can't remember if it's Arthur Conan if it was Arthur Conan Doyle
B	well Lewis Carroll was erm
A	oh was he?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and there are there is like some mathematical things like hidden in it
A	oh right?
B	but
A	mm
B	like I mean he wrote like
A	yeah
B	doesn't really seem to be any maths
A	although they say er to be
B	yeah
B	yeah but Einstein was scientific and he was like imagination is more
A	imagination is erm
B	yeah more so and he's like if you want your
A	see all those fairy tales I used to make up for you
B	well
B	if you made them up I mean like yeah you can write your own I really like cos I did that project on fairy tales
A	mm
B	er
A	well
B	he means stories yeah
B	referencing the Grimms there
B	yeah I know but that but back then back then it
A	yeah
B	but what else would they be like to children? they would be
A	yeah
B	that's what they would've been telling them
A	well he was probably
B	yeah
A	his work was kind of like early twentieth century wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	that it became
B	it might not have been
A	why who's the other one?
B	Hans Christian Andersen
A	what was they were before Grimms?
B	no they were about the same time
A	well he was Danish wasn't he?
B	yeah no but
A	well Grimms did they make them up
B	no they
A	well yeah so
B	yeah they well they are they are folk stories but
A	but it's I always imagined they're original works by them that they'd written
B	well
A	they added to them and
B	they have been changed
A	yeah
B	er no
A	Hans Christian Andersen was his original? like The Ugly Duckling and stuff like that? I think it was wasn't it?
B	I think it was yeah
A	he he was a storyteller
B	but but the erm yeah
A	yeah
B	like they are kind of very much a product of Grimm
A	yeah
B	but yeah no I think
A	yeah I think he is original tales aren't they? stories
B	yeah
A	I've not been looking where we're going I don't think we would've passed it yet would we?
B	no hopefully not
A	Poison?
A	oh
B	Poison? imagine where are you from? oh I'm from Poison
B	I think erm
B	oh
A	did you see the
B	no
A	said something in another language it must be
B	oh no he wrote like Little Red Riding Hood and
A	yeah but he didn't write that did he?
B	yeah but he might've done I don't know
A	I thought that's a folk tale again
B	maybe
A	to make children
B	but we don't know if we he
B	yeah
A	what time was that?
B	erm
A	when were they?
B	dunno like
A	really?
B	seventeen hundreds maybe
A	yeah it is kinda the time I imagined or seventeenth
B	yeah
A	whatever it was
B	yeah
A	er it does sound yeah it does seem like
B	yeah
B	doesn't say anything about
B	we might've
A	really?
B	although no that was
A	oh is it we're there
B	although
A	oh why didn't you tell me
B	no it's
A	yeah
B	and then at the roundabout we need to take the third exit onto the
A	well there hasn't been any branch left yet?
B	no
A	er this is a turn rather than a branch
A	did you say that?
B	no
A	it's a funny
B	I know does anyone still
A	no the last woman died er so many years ago
B	no she died
A	must be still
B	yeah if they've still got yeah
A	must be still in existence but nobody's I suppose a linguist could
B	oh it's a dead language like Latin
B	do you think Ancient Greek is any different to normal Greek?
A	yeah it's a completely different language isn't it?
B	is it like Latin and English?
A	yeah I mean Latin
B	is it the same alphabet?
A	well Latin
B	yeah
B	oh right
B	it's just cos it's got the same name like Greek and Ancient Greek
A	yeah well
B	yeah
A	it's not like Latin is it?
B	no
A	but I know Latin
B	yeah
A	see that
B	yeah
A	maybe it's
B	but it doesn't have
A	do you want to have a look at my satnav again just stroll down
B	oh you've got a text do you want me to look at it?
A	no
B	where's that postcode gone?
A	will it not be in there somehow?
B	no you've got your history turned off
B	can't search
A	do you wanna try my satnav?
B	yeah maybe
A	I'm sure you know it's just to make as we get closer it might be
B	oh hang on
A	might need to get some fuel
B	go
A	what's going?
B	it's start navigation
A	oh right
A	any idea where we turn off?
B	erm we're going to
A	are we?
B	yeah
B	wow how long are we gonna be on this for?
A	we are on the
B	no on this map
A	why have we missed the turn off
B	we must've done
A	can't believe we've driven fifty miles
B	maybe not then but this is taking us a different way
A	well how could it change its mind so quick?
B	this satnav
A	yeah but you used that before didn't you?
B	no but that wasn't I that didn't say anything like I didn't look at the directions on that
A	on what?
B	on the satnav I didn't look at the directions before I just looked at the time
A	well why but why do you think it's taken us a different way?
A	oh right
B	no
A	would've been handy I should've stopped and looked at that one maybe
B	what?
A	should've stopped and looked at the map
B	do you want me to stop this satnav?
A	no
B	no
A	oh right well how did you see the
B	I've just got
A	for what?
B	then we'll arrive
A	what till we get there?
B	yeah
A	in
B	yeah
A	on I thought you meant till we turn off
B	no
A	oh right
A	really?
B	yeah
A	well how do you know it's taken us a different way?
B	because I've just looked through the directions
A	yeah
B	and what it's gonna tell us to do
A	yeah
B	and then
A	to the end?
B	and then we're gonna go onto the
A	oh right
B	and then we're gonna go take the first exit at the roundabout
A	well it might be worth just going down
B	do you want me to get your other satnav out?
A	yeah put that in and see what that says keep that one on as well
A	so we should be turning left here next left
B	I'm going I'm going
A	maybe we'll maybe we should follow that this turn off and then
B	yeah
A	what's the name of that place again?
B	oh
B	yeah
B	no search results
A	is there an address on it?
B	do I need to put a space?
A	probably
B	oh there we go
A	that was quick
B	shall I take this one off?
A	leave it on for a moment
B	oh street not digitised
A	that doesn't matter it's maybe the main road
B	it's just spinning
A	oh right is it? well that's not a good sign then is it?
B	it doesn't have a clue
B	it says we'll be there in thirty-four minutes
A	our satnav?
B	yeah
B	no cos it doesn't know where we are
A	well how can it know how long till we get there?
B	it doesn't it doesn't know what road we're on
A	yeah but
B	cos it knows where we are but it doesn't think we're on the road
B	according to this map that's where it's got the arrow over there in that field
A	that doesn't make any sense though
B	that's where it is
A	oh
B	sheep
A	eh?
B	thinks we're in that field look
A	oh well it's rubbish then isn't it? no point in us depending on that satnav
A	queue ahead?
B	doesn't seem to be queue
A	no maybe there is
A	yeah
B	then at
B	yeah so you're gonna branch left before you go to the roundabout
A	that
B	no
A	oh look at all these queues
B	that's probably why there's queues oh there's
B	wow look at that lake
A	I thought it was some massive thing
A	not very big is it?
A	so has anything happened on mine?
B	no
A	are we on the road now?
B	yeah
A	how long does it take?
B	thirty-three minutes
A	oh right
B	yeah shall I turn this one on?
A	yeah
B	it'll be using your thing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no
A	eager for a
A	probably from the phone company telling me something
A	not looking cos it's stupid
B	if I see it then yeah but if not then no
A	off who?
B	dunno anyone
A	who's it from? did anyone say?
B	I didn't look
A	I've never had an SOS message so I'm not likely to get one
B	neither have I but you never know
A	could be
A	yeah
B	cos you had to pay per word didn't you?
A	well per letter probably possibly character or
B	per letter
A	well yeah that's why
A	at the end of a sentence you'd have to
B	well
A	well yeah sentences yeah
B	that's why they put
A	no they they'd put a
B	no they would write stop
A	how
B	cos I I I know stuff about telegrams
A	no they wouldn't write stop
B	they would
A	well you mustn't be charged for that word
B	well maybe
A	oh right
B	it would literally so stop so you'd know where the sentence stops
A	oh right
B	because you would have to type it out on like a Morse thing wouldn't you?
A	well
B	yeah
A	and then they they they would have a they just only used to have telegramming but they had telephones and they wouldn't use that
B	oh
A	they'd they'd still type a message out and have deliver it
B	yeah that's what I'm on about
A	yeah so well you'd still have the same thing in existence even when telephones existed
B	so how did they do it on telephone?
A	well you
B	oh and you'd tell them and they'd write it down?
A	yeah so they hand deliver it
B	oh
A	erm
B	I don't know about that
A	to the person
B	I only know about the Morse one
A	oh right
B	cos you can't cos obviously you can't put full stops that means something in Morse
A	oh I see what you're saying yeah with the original er
B	so you have to put stop
A	telegrams yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so you could ring up and give your message
B	oh
A	er you know if something urgent if
B	yeah
A	not necessarily that but yeah that was kind of
B	oh yeah
A	what's happening has somebody died or something?
B	yeah I did say I said telegraph but then you started talking about telegrams
A	oh right
B	so then I thought oh it must be called a telegram
A	no the telegrams yeah that that was before telephone wasn't it? it was er before
B	yeah
B	but that'd take ages wouldn't it because it's like
B	isn't SOS dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot?
A	well you you
B	I think SOS is the only one I've ever learned and I think that's what it is
A	well yeah I
B	yeah yeah
A	oh right
B	and they taught us SOS and told us to remember that one
A	but now mobile phones are invented you don't
B	yeah no but you might not get erm
A	signal
B	yeah
A	yeah you're on a hill and you'll be flashing your light
B	oh yeah
A	shut the window
A	it's good on
B	yeah but
A	do you think there's a thing there dot dot dot that you can?
B	oh can you imagine if that's what the breakdown phones are like? you have to send it in Morse
B	but didn't you see them? didn't they at one point have when a telegraph was coming through it like the machine would punch
A	no that's a
B	oh
A	that's a different thing cos had
B	no
A	not sure
B	is that so the person wouldn't have to listen? so carefully?
A	I've no idea I don't know what
B	cos it would be a dot or a dash
A	oh right
B	I don't know
A	like Braille?
B	maybe
A	well
A	it's better that you can actually read it rather than touching it
A	oh right
B	and I I
A	mm
B	and also
A	yeah
B	blind people know that the road's coming up
A	yeah
B	I was
A	yeah
B	that's probably why it is
A	suppose unless we need to know we don't really pay much attention
B	yeah
A	oh look hills in the distance
B	where?
A	they've gone behind
A	trees
A	yeah that turn off's still not come up has it? strange
B	basically just carry on and don't bear left
B	thanks for that
A	what road are we on? are we on the
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that title
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it comes from there
A	oh right
B	but like it
A	did you not?
B	no have you read it?
A	is it? no it's not a
B	yeah
A	oh we're only nineteen miles now
B	I thought it was quite interesting
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I should make the effort to try and start reading some
B	yeah then they're just rubbish
A	yeah well they're readable
B	yeah
B	but if you go for erm
A	from where?
B	Amazon
A	oh really?
B	yeah like
A	okay
B	some of them like what have I got? I got erm
A	actually you know classics are
B	yeah
A	classic you know I've really loved
B	slow
A	well
B	yeah
A	the satisfaction out of it that you
B	like a page turner?
A	yeah depends what you're reading for doesn't it?
B	oh
B	even among classic readers
A	I think I've read a a certain amount of pages but
B	like
A	the thing is the book the prose is really thick and
B	it's basically a guy that has to hunt whales
A	yeah but I could find it
A	you know I could see why that might have its interest but
B	do you think?
A	but the words are the book I've bought for really cheaply
A	and the the words are tiny
B	if you enjoyed
A	oh right
B	it's like one of the first kind of proper like detective novels I think
A	what is it an old one?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	it was like
A	it's about what?
B	it's about a
B	take the
A	maybe I should've turned left there and it didn't tell me
B	er oh
A	this
A	so
B	I know
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh it's back on now is it? fourteen miles maybe I should just follow the signs
B	yeah
A	tell me where to turn off then go back to that
B	yeah
A	when we get close to it
B	no it's back here
A	look there's a left turn here
B	probably yeah
A	but it didn't say turn left did it? maybe this is quite a new
B	what?
A	that where we have to turn off left
A	yeah
B	er that's right at the bottom that's
B	at roundabout take second exit onto
B	but that's after you've
B	that's quite a while
A	look more wind
B	oh
A	there's the
B	oh yeah
B	I always call them windmills cos you call them windmills
A	why
A	what?
B	yeah
B	I called them windmills in my French lesson
A	cos I think
B	and it's a turbine it's not a mill
A	oh right
B	and people were like why are you going on about windmills? and I was like cos windmills they're like no it's wind turbine and I was like
B	yeah you
A	oh right
B	so I
A	yeah a windmill it it it the old flour and so on and stuff
B	it's a mill yeah
A	well the operation the wind turns the sails doesn't it? I think
B	right
A	you may as well it doesn't seem to working right does it?
B	yeah
A	really? is it on voice thing now?
B	yeah well it said I clicked on the settings then it said mute so I'm guessing it's on loud
A	alright yeah
B	oh right
A	just about had enough fuel to get here
A	yeah look at those hills they look really weird
B	yeah
A	like kind of pointed aren't they?
A	yeah
B	ash or something going down the side
A	I don't know
A	it's to do with where you are in the
B	oh yeah
A	and you have to be on that line I guess don't you?
B	oh yeah we don't really have any do we? but it's funny because
A	I think
B	yeah because isn't it like?
A	they're only in a certain part of the world
B	yeah because I think like hills are formed something like where it's been pushed together isn't it like the land? so
A	or it's been by the river
B	yeah
A	over billions of years the river
B	yeah
A	creates a valley
B	yeah
A	can we turn left here?
B	duh duh duh duh duh
A	gotta figure out what the sign means left for
B	I think so
A	looks like it
B	er
A	is this it yeah? is this that turn off we were supposed to be looking for? yeah
A	no leave it on cos we're not far
B	use the left lane to take the
A	the
A	is it American that voice?
B	I don't know
A	like where where is he now third?
A	yeah
A	signed anyway
B	one
A	why?
B	to make sure we get the right one
A	I can't believe it it it started like
B	yeah it was like boom
A	I'm getting
A	we'll have enough to get there I think
B	we'll have to call your pick ups out
B	your
A	what did he say do now?
A	we're coming up to something
B	oh is it?
A	that's what the sign says what's the sign gonna say?
B	it should say it again
A	it should tell you there now
B	it it's showing you there don't know what that is
A	that's not
B	is it the third?
A	well that says
B	mm mm
B	oh well it'll redirect you
B	yeah
A	this seems like this seems like it should be the way we should've gone
B	yeah
A	well it might take us a
B	yeah
A	is it saying any different time or anything?
B	no
B	yeah me and mummy always count the roundabout stops to make sure we get the right one
A	yeah
B	cos sometimes it's not clear
A	I kind of in my head just look at them
A	I don't go one two three and all that
A	but you yeah you just pay attention which
B	is that a? these bends are a bit sharp aren't they you can't even see what's coming round the corner
A	mm?
B	all the cyclists
B	yeah
B	oh I like those bushes
B	are they hydrangeas?
A	don't know
B	they're like erm
A	same thing then
B	although
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	were they not chrysanthemums?
A	do they look I dunno
A	oh okay
B	do you not know much about flowers?
A	I know what a rose looks like
A	oh it's on empty now
B	I don't know that much about flowers
A	yeah but you probably know more than me
B	yeah
A	I could recognise a daffodil a tulip a daisy a rose
B	no
A	yeah
