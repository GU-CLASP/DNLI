A	you should find out if it's linked to
B	there might be a good scheme and they might obviously not match it but they might
A	mm
B	contribute quite a little
A	mm
B	or at least an amount
A	they might do yeah yeah
C	mm
A	our business property but of course if you then
B	oh okay
A	so the pension pot is making money
B	so you're better to rent it out to you yourself
A	yeah
C	mm yeah
A	but but you're getting money back into a pension pot
B	did did you purchase the er property in the end?
A	we didn't do it in the end no no
B	so is it still rented now?
A	yeah
C	it is? rented?

B	and we're looking for we're gonna look into move out in the next maybe two months to
A	mm mm
B	a larger unit so we need to kind of
A	oh really?
B	look at the threshold of
A	excellent yes
B	there's not just a set amount it doesn't just match up based on size does it? there's more to it it's about the rateable valual
A	mm
B	of the property
A	mm mm
B	so it's
A	yeah
B	that clear to finance it
A	no no

C	yeah
B	ice cream?
C	we've got ice cream just need to go and get some cookies
A	have you er oh no
C	ah
A	I was hoping it might be
C	oh well
A	I thought about swapping it I thought it would be fine it did feel a bit flat and clearly I did do a little bit of damage to the pasty
C	mm
A	he won't notice will he? by by the time it's cooked
C	no
A	should be grateful he's being fed
C	yeah
A	some they they looked at a caravan apparently today
C	mm
C	really?
A	well I said to your dad are you going up again? and he said well not next week but maybe the week after
C	right
A	so
C	so
B	so
A	you put this in the dishwasher
C	Iceland
A	yeah we'll do
B	nothing why?
C	there's
C	oh
B	it's a bit of
C	something floating in that some lasagne
B	oh probably
A	well the Iceland's really really dependent on whether
C	well me and
A	no no well er er none none of us have to go on holidays
B	if it was like an extra twenty thirty forty pounds we'd do it of course but
A	but not if it no no
B	if it was extravagant I think
A	I
B	yes
A	so I said to her well you either skive a couple of days off school
C	yeah
A	so you know
C	cos we are just gonna go from
A	so
C	Wednesday night
A	yeah
C	to Sunday night
A	so she'll need to make a decision on on whether cos an extra four people's a big
C	yeah
A	we need to have a think
C	cos if we have more people
A	so I I
C	the Airbnb surely it's gonna be better cos we were looking and the one that
A	that was you know the one you found was that for ten people or eight people? that was good
B	yeah I think so
A	mm
B	I think it was maybe four bedrooms would sleep ten maybe
A	yeah that
B	well I I think that that's probably fine in er
A	mm
B	sharing a room in there like a bunk bed or something
A	mm yeah yeah
C	four? I'm sure we'd need five one
A	one two
C	two
A	possibly five yeah
B	yeah
A	but but yeah
B	something like that
A	yeah yeah
B	it was only briefly I we I haven't looked into it
A	mm
B	erm it might be twenty-five miles out of the centre
A	or yeah cos the other thing was yeah is it close enough for us to do the what we wanna do? and yeah
B	I assume so I I'm not a hundred percent which
C	but the thing is it's so expensive in Reykjavik mum we were even
A	I know
C	saying like maybe
A	mm
C	we would go a little bit further out but because we've got cars we can drive
A	well I I yeah absolutely
C	cos we obviously
A	mm
C	wanna stay in a really nice house don't we?
A	that that would be lovely and then as long as there's supermarkets we can buy food like you say we've got our breakfast we've got our evening meal we've got everything we need to to cook then that's erm we maybe go out one night but the rest of the time we can eat in can't we?
B	yeah best of both
A	especially if we've got the pool the swimming pool was lovely I mean you've got something like that
B	mm
A	in the basement I mean how fabulous would would that be?
B	there was another nice one actually wasn't there? it was like
C	we want a I think we want a bigger pool than that though don't we?
A	you we'd just be
B	you might struggle to be honest
A	that but that would be loads of fun you'd spend all your evening in that
C	yeah we
A	oh

C	I do I just want like a nice decking area outside with a hot tub
A	right
C	cos that's where you're gonna spend your time isn't it? if we had like a really good view
A	it's freezing
C	if we had a good view
C	and we could see the Northern Lights and we had the hot tub and
B	you're not guaranteed to see the Northern Lights you know
A	no no there's no guarantee of that
C	yeah but in January there's a good chance
A	that is a phenomenon of nature
B	I think
A	maybe
B	go on
A	I think
C	or we go somewhere else and we go in October
A	oh a different place?
C	yeah
A	yeah but everybody wants to go to Iceland that was the place that we'd all decided that everybody
C	oh yeah
A	keeps talking about going
C	yeah it's just like when when when's best to go then?
A	because we're also talking about just a short break
C	mm
C	mm
A	so it's
C	I'm gonna have to
A	that'll be four days won't it? you have to book a week for the
C	yeah
A	oh okay
C	no I'll just book the Monday to Sunday can't I? and then just have the Monday Tuesday Wednesday off
A	mm you can't just book a few days?
C	oh I don't know I've never done it like that but everyone seems to be coming to me at work at the moment can I have this day off
A	oh
C	this day off
B	how many days would it be how many nights would it be for?
A	four
B	four?
A	yeah Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
B	what would the budget be do you think per night?
A	come on
B	this one's eleven hundred per night so it's a lot of money
A	yeah
B	but I suppose between ten
A	yeah
B	it's not too bad
C	how much? a hundred and ten each a night?
B	yeah so four hundred pound for your
A	yeah
B	accommodation in Iceland not too bad but it's
A	yeah
B	it's like a mansion it is nice
A	is it?
B	I'll just turn the brightness up
A	how many people does this sleep?
B	er
A	so
B	okay this is the works it sleeps sixteen it's got nine rooms
B	that's pretty special isn't it though?
A	it looks amazing
B	and you're literally

B	in the middle of nowhere kind of yeah
A	that looks beautiful yeah
C	but there's no sixteen of us
B	yeah but you don't need to fill it do you? see that little mini bar
A	it does look so how how much is that each?
B	a hundred and ten per night each I don't think it's too bad

A	food and everything else

B	dunno well I'm sure you could but you you'd have to watch about fifty films
A	I couldn't
B	and it's this yeah
A	I just got a little bit it I only missed the last three or four and I said to
B	yeah
A	if you've watched a series then there was a gap and you had a series
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but when you catch up
B	because you did it
A	and you watch it
B	yes yeah
A	and it gets a bit repetitive and I'm like oh I'm a bit
B	yes
A	at the end
B	yes they do
A	and I missed that bit but he's he's trying to just so that's really the main bit he had had he run has he got presidency again?
B	er he
A	had he
B	he got president because he he he did he did over the existing president
A	right
B	like a kind of
A	yes
B	what er this big fraudulent scandal wasn't it?
A	that's right that's right yeah I
B	forced him into so he wasn't
A	that's right
B	elected but he
A	no but the election was coming up?
B	now it's the actual election coming up and
A	oh so this is this is the start of the election then?
B	it hasn't started yet it's the campaign
A	right
B	but him and
A	so he's president at the moment just from the virtue of the fact that he took over
B	yes yeah yeah
A	his wife's left him
B	no one really knows it the the
A	we thought she had at the
B	she got she walked out on him
A	at the end of the last one
B	they haven't officially but now
A	oh
B	there's a bit of a grudge between them and they're kind of
A	right
B	against each other but
A	so have you started watching series?
B	I
A	right okay
B	and it started off really really good
A	right I'm gonna watch it then well if you can set that up that'll be brilliant
B	yes it it's er
A	two A M and you were
B	yeah yeah
A	oh my lord
C	you woke me about half past two in the morning
A	wow
B	that's sad
A	well
B	mm mm
A	when she talks to people and I
B	oh it's erm
A	mm
B	especially if you've
A	mm
B	done them quite fast I mean
A	yeah I think it all got a bit samey got a bit
B	mm mm
A	whereas it probably wouldn't have been samey had I had a a gap
B	mm
A	I like watching Homeland
B	yeah
A	I've enjoyed them but you kind of watch them all together it's like oh
B	mm
A	you see it repeat some things and
B	yeah
A	oh and you also told me cos that there was that guy
C	mm
A	who who was the one that got shot by the by the girl? and he said he got her he he got that girl back or something?
B	oh Doug
A	Doug
B	mm
A	so he bought cos he'd kind of sidelined Doug really
B	yeah he had
A	so he's Doug's back in it
B	went a bit crazy didn't he yeah?
A	that's what
B	he's erm
A	that's what
C	there's no direct flights
B	he's a big character again
A	oh
C	no
A	where have we gotta go from then? Luton or Manchester?
C	well there isn't is there
B	I'm not sure I
A	well I
C	I I only I had a brief look and I couldn't find any
A	I thought there was
C	but
A	oh well we'll be able to go elsewhere
A	I'm amazed about that
C	no
A	what?
C	nothing's matching my criteria
A	oh it's the days you've put in not
C	mm
A	oh
C	you have a look
B	what am I gonna do different to what you've done? what you on here?
C	who knows
B	Edreams and just
C	Iceland Air
B	mm?
C	Iceland Air
A	oh have you gone via er
B	on the actual on the actual main website?
C	mm
A	yeah the
B	so January?
A	that's the other thing finding the flights that go when we want them
B	want to I have my laptop shall I bring my laptop out so everyone can see?
A	mm
B	yes
A	yes a pre meeting meeting
B	we're definitely up for it aren't we
A	mm
B	especially if you're
A	be good fun wouldn't it?
B	mm mm
A	we can't do more than four days we'd all have fallen out by then
C	you reckon?
A	no
A	what?
A	your vat return?
B	yes going on can I put through the business a private registration plate?
A	erm
B	it will be potentially
A	potentially for a company car?
B	yes
A	well I'd give it a go
B	yeah
A	right? has it got has it got vat on it?
B	yes
A	registration plates have vat under there okay so it's gonna actually be your car?
B	yes I I've I've bought one maybe about two weeks ago
A	yeah
B	it's a fifteen plate reg
A	what oh what's the
B	I've got
A	oh
B	and then
A	oh
B	the
B	yeah it's quite fancy
C	and then space
A	excellent
B	yeah
A	oh nice
B	so it is fancy
A	oh nice
B	I'll show you
A	let's have a look
B	it's it's it's a fifteen plate though so it only come out like a few months ago so I thought
A	yeah
B	I'm gonna
A	right
B	and grab it quickly before it goes
A	I I'm not entirely sure erm I would say if it was going on on a car that was owned by the company
B	yeah
A	this is going on your car however your car is used for business
B	but it won't be going on this it it can't go on this car
A	oh it's not going on this car?
B	no
A	oh I see so it's it's for a future car?
B	yes
A	oh well in that
C	future business car
A	well in that case yes yes because if this is gonna go on a car because you could have every intention now of purchasing the next car through the company
B	and and which which probably is the case like
A	mm mm
B	er genuinely
A	in that case erm yes
B	don't see why not
A	yeah
B	and the next one how about er gym equipment?
A	gym equipment? yeah
B	yes
A	okay well hang we can we can deal with gym equipment so you're buying gym equipment is it gonna go on the premises at work? or it's gonna go in your house?
B	not now it's not
A	not now?
B	it's gonna go in my garage but
C	but cos
A	in the future
B	unit
A	well
B	for the employees
A	yeah and and for the purposes of should anybody be erm looking to check where it is it could be
B	but our erm our business registration isn't the business
A	right
B	so
A	mm
B	I could just
A	so for the sake of the business yeah I mean yeah
B	I could just change the company register to my house if I wanted to
A	we had erm
A	that went through mm yeah yeah
B	cool cos
A	yeah?
B	it cost eight hundred which I thought was a bargain because
C	it is really good
A	a bargain?
B	well there's similar at literally five
A	thousand
B	to fifty thousand
A	something
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	they that's a very good one actually for for you isn't it?
B	yeah it's
C	not the one I
A	you've er
C	two grand
A	I don't see how I I've never you you asked me didn't you a while ago what I thought I said well
B	yeah
A	to me it's never appealed because if you cut somebody up
C	yeah
A	that's that is
C	it's cool isn't it?
A	yeah
B	so that's quite er
A	yeah
B	recognisable
A	yeah
B	and because it's a fifteen plate
A	but the only thing you've got on extra is is the extra S really
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm but yeah
C	it's cool
A	but you've you've always said to me did I fancy it I said no you cut somebody up they're gonna know who's done that
A	they're gonna
B	that was
A	yeah oh I remember that plate when it comes past again
B	but because it's a fifteen plate it can only go on cars that are fifteen or newer
A	oh
A	oh
C	that's a fifteen plate
A	I see
B	erm
A	oh so you can't put that on a car
B	mm
A	even if it's a personalised plate? you can't just put that on any car you want?
B	no no it has to
C	no cos you
B	the car has to be
C	cos you'd you'd put a plate that was brand new on wouldn't you if you could?
A	oh I
C	so your car looks brand new
A	oh right I hadn't thought about that
B	so that's why it's quite cheaper than it should be because it's probably not available to that many people because they wouldn't be able to go on the vehicle
A	oh but you're
B	so I think it
A	buying it as an investment for the future car
B	I think it will appreciate I think it will
A	good good for you
B	cos there's very similar ones they're absolutely
A	yeah
B	thousands and thousands
A	no no I think it's a good idea and I think in that case yes cos it's gonna be for the business did we come up with any answer on those plates of mine that were in the back of the car? you you were googling something weren't you about that? what
B	yes er
A	did we get anywhere with that?
B	I think it asked for me some for some information that I didn't have
A	that we didn't have?
B	mm
A	right
B	I think more than likely they're just the plate as opposed to
A	we can't
B	I think I think it's just a bit of plastic
A	we can't sell those plates it's not
B	no
A	no
B	I think you'd need the document I have a document that I've received for my plate I haven't actually got
A	oh right
B	any physical plastic
A	right
B	so I think more than likely for me it's just the plastic they've left in there dunno why they would leave them in there though
A	no we didn't well it's it's it was personal to the car rather than her wasn't it? cos it was
B	mm
A	something something
C	put mum
B	but the reg has to be erm
A	yeah it went back to the original plate it was
B	the the
A	registered with
B	private reg would have had to be transferred to you as an individual and if that wasn't
A	right
B	then they wouldn't of
A	yes I wonder why they were
B	mm
A	there was an extra charge I didn't want a
B	no
A	this whole personalised but you've always liked it
A	as well haven't you? but
B	it's
C	mine's a
A	and and to be and and your dad had yeah
C	mine's expensive though two grand for mine to keep it
B	and it's it's not as I don't think it stands out as much as that's why I
C	well yeah
A	yeah it's a good one
C	that's pretty good
B	that is good that is good
A	oh
C	so twenty-one my birthday
A	it's
B	oh right I didn't I didn't realise the twenty-one
A	what's the R for?
C	that's the twenty-one
A	oh
B	yeah
A	come on
B	but it's a
B	but
A	that's only personal
B	I was gonna say without putting her down putting it down
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't know that
A	no
B	no one would know that apart from maybe
A	no and that wouldn't have cost
B	a handful of people
A	an awful lot I wouldn't have thought to get something like that
C	it cost her about two grand
B	no
A	what?
B	it wouldn't
C	cos that's what I'm looking at
A	they
C	for mine
A	they wouldn't have cost that
B	what's hers say?
A	hers is
A	no no that wouldn't have cost anywhere near that
B	no cos it's cos it's
A	it doesn't say anything
B	no
A	yours does say
C	mm
B	to to me that just says
C	oh
B	I probably wouldn't even notice it was a private reg plate
C	but the thing is that I
A	no no
C	I haven't even got there's not a
B	I wouldn't I wouldn't bother anyway because no one would know
A	no
C	oh I can't even look
A	and what if you're not always
C	maybe not
A	G B?
B	you could still have that plate
B	for a good fifteen years then
C	G B

D	they had them in they had a pair in the boot so that was a ten so I just wore extra socks
A	ten
A	oh right
D	is that a picture of something?
A	what have we got here then?

A	ah ooh crikey one four five that from where?

C	do you wanna pay?
B	alright
A	don't talk to me like that
C	no but I'm just wondering
C	do you wanna pay more money?
B	we'll see
A	not really
C	exactly so we've gotta go to London
A	well what time are the flights? I'm thinking for
B	that one was about quarter past eleven that one was
A	at night?
B	in the morning
A	oh in the morning mm so it's another day
D	is this Iceland again?
B	mm
C	yes dad
A	she she's she won't get the time off will she? she's not had a single day
B	I don't think they'll fly on a Wednesday
C	no
B	from Birmingham
C	no there's and there's no direct flights like you said they'd take like fourteen hours
A	oh right well that's no good
B	Copenhagen?
A	that's no good
C	yeah
A	like to Manchester or anything?
C	no it isn't Copenhagen's the same way as Iceland
A	Denmark yeah you're going up a bit
D	yes well
A	mm
D	oh thank you
B	yes I
A	the best one
B	our only option really
C	can't go from Birmingham mum
A	you've got
C	yeah
A	or
C	you'd have to do a stop and it's also more money
A	mm right
C	and they don't actually fly Wednesday to Sunday
B	so these are the er
A	could you get a Wednesday evening though? cos I'm thinking
B	I think so
A	well yeah wouldn't it? that's the thing having to get down there and then you're in the rush hour traffic
B	eleven twenty
A	the other option is you know we don't all have to go out on the same day if it doesn't suit you if you wanted to get
B	yeah yeah
A	because
C	it doesn't what what it doesn't go any later
A	if we if we'd gone out there and made
C	mum it doesn't go any later
A	oh it doesn't go later
B	it would have to be the following day
A	have to be the following day for them
B	they'd still get
A	do you know what I mean? you've got stuff in
C	mm
B	all day
A	well
B	I mean it wouldn't half day Thursday
A	that would
B	mm
A	we'd have to ask her that but they're they're gonna be quite strict aren't they the school times but that's a good price isn't it?
B	yes
A	and that's a good time because you know you
B	three hours fifteen
A	okay
B	and then three hours five return
A	is there any time difference up up there?
B	er
A	are we on the same?
B	I doubt it I'm not sure
A	are we on the same erm
B	I'll have a look erm

A	right
B	and it was just the cheapest I think but
A	mm mm oh okay mm mm
B	I don't
A	oh we'll
B	I don't think I don't think there's much in it to be honest
A	no
B	that's a little bit more expensive
A	you said you didn't want anything else in with that
D	that's fine fine
A	okay

A	oh so he doesn't he doesn't live there?
D	so so he
A	what was he going to Lidl for? water?
D	water
A	oh

C	yeah
D	how's it going
C	mm
D	Tuesday?
A	no
C	oh
D	was it?
C	no no no just
D	people
C	got I felt like I was back at school really
A	meeting with
D	right
C	we've moved on and we're not talking about it anymore
A	she's moved on
D	oh right
A	are you getting on okay with her?
D	okay
A	is she
C	yeah we had this conversation earlier you asked me I've told her
A	well that was yesterday I'm just wondering about today
C	I've not been in
A	oh no
D	it's been a good day then
B	oh did you?
D	oh right
A	oh hang have you not told anybody?
C	no I forgot to tell you
A	well announce it now
D	announce
A	do tell
C	just that they found that woman
B	really?
D	right
B	that's good news
A	yeah I thought so
D	yes
B	or is that a bit of an
B	bit of an inconvenience for you is it?
C	dunno really
B	do you have to go to court and stuff now and all that?
A	well I said yeah but they've said the text said that what they've arrested and charged somebody following the reports given
B	yeah
A	so I I'm imagining if she pleads guilty
B	mm
A	but I'm thinking if she doesn't plead guilty that's when they might be calling upon
D	yes
A	would you expect that?
B	what would the charge be do you think?
C	police jail
B	yeah not
A	police
B	yes
A	but are they are they charging it as burglary or aggravated er assault or attempted assault or?
B	it would be more than likely be magistrates wouldn't it and like community service and stuff?
A	I
B	really?
C	that's what they told me
A	well it's I suppose
C	cos she's done it on
A	it depends if she's got
C	countless times
A	how how did they know she's done it
D	yeah she's probably well-known
A	how did they know that? did they know who she was then?
C	well cos she did it in the high street store the other
A	yeah but that was on the same day
B	that was still within the same day
A	so
C	no it wasn't the same day
B	oh was it not?
A	oh she's
C	no she was doing it on various occasions
D	oh really? oh right
B	oh so they do know her?
C	yeah
A	they have caught her before then they've obviously convicted her
C	no no no no no they haven't caught her before but they know that she's
B	how do they know who she is then?
C	because they've got CCTV on the other stores
A	well a week before so we're talking about has she got a history from
C	oh right
A	the year before six months before she'd been convicted before now
C	oh I don't know
A	that's what we're saying that's what gives you a record
C	oh I don't know
A	so if she's been if she hasn't been convicted before
C	yeah
A	this this is her first offence they've actually charged her with then
C	he told me she's done it on numerous occasions so if she gets caught now then she's going to prison
D	right
B	so how does so they do know who she is then?
C	I guess so then if he said that to me yeah that's what the policeman said to me
B	oh
D	well she's probably
A	okay
D	been cautioned or something before and they
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah they must have recognised her from the CCTV
B	they must her on file
D	so she's on bail and therefore if she does it
B	mm
D	she's gonna
A	right
C	yeah
D	it'll be difficult for not not to really isn't it? because she
C	we've got pictures of her
D	there's pictures of her and
A	that's what I thought yeah
D	greater
A	harsher
D	mm
C	and then she'll come out and try and find me
A	well no not if she not if you don't have to testify
C	she will
A	not if you haven't gotta testify
C	yeah but if if I go to prison if if I go to erm
C	court whatever and have to sit there and watch her she then knows again what I look like
A	yes
C	and she'll she they they probably do come and find you then don't they?
A	well
B	and do what?
C	or like you say that she's got friends of friends in the audience
A	we've watched a bit too much erm
C	that'll come and find me
A	The Bill
C	that's what mum said
A	The
C	she'll have friends of friends in the audience
A	no I said that er
B	as your mum scared you
A	like you you said they I said I said that's always a risk I said cos we've watched a lot of crime programmes but this is petty theft and she might not bother and she might not have friends
C	but if she does bother and comes back
A	or
C	follows me to the train station
A	the thing I also said to you is you don't have to go to court they can't make you go to court you can say I'm not going and you can say to the police look it you know you you can say is this conviction dependent on me coming to court? have you got enough evidence without me? because I really don't want to do it you know you you can
D	mm
A	they can't make you
C	no
A	so let's see what happens
B	I guess the difference is they'll do her for
A	yes
A	yes mm mm
B	they'll probably need a statement from you then or maybe an appearance
D	so if you wanted to press charges now they've got her you could do
A	compensation
D	but
C	compensation? what or
B	do you reckon you could even though there's no?
A	I don't know I don't know if they convict her mm
B	mm
A	yeah probably
B	could do could say like it's
A	yeah
B	walk anywhere by yourself and all this mentally
D	I don't I don't understand why you wouldn't because you
A	mm
D	you don't want any aggro you don't want to be involved do you?
C	no
D	so
D	if they ask you to appear don't say you don't want to but you just give a
A	yeah you haven't
D	you can answer can't you?
A	you haven't gotta go so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about that yet
C	but
A	no
D	no no
C	they wouldn't
A	no
D	give them
A	no
D	any of my
A	no
D	information?
A	no
D	no
A	no
A	no
D	confidential
C	cos obviously all my details are on their
A	no they no
D	confidential
A	she gets none none of that
B	full name address
C	yeah
B	who is who is this person?
A	no she no
D	no
A	they've got her banged to rights
D	the police don't
A	and
B	I'm definitely getting you some pepper spray anyway for your bag
A	there you go then
B	oh really?
C	yeah
B	I was looking on er
A	is that legal?
B	I think some maybe
B	not
A	you'll be arrested next
B	well I come across this website when I was looking it's er
B	all the reviews they're for
B	they're obviously really strong
A	knock out a grizzly bear
B	yes so
A	right
A	you ought to be careful
B	you'd probably blind them
A	cos you could be in in er police custody next
C	what would I do with the spray? just put it in her face?
B	you spray it
A	mm yeah
C	in her in her face?
D	yeah yeah
B	everywhere
D	yeah yeah
B	just yeah you just choke on it gets in your eyes yeah
C	but won't it choke me as well?
B	no cos should point it at them
A	yeah don't don't turn it the wrong way
A	and spray it by mistake
D	I mean away from you
B	it's like
A	you you you
A	you need to
A	check what's illegal
C	and we need we need to test it out you need to show me how to use it
B	well I'm not being the dummy
A	oh dear who can you find that you really don't like?
B	just spray it's like a can of deodorant you just spray it
A	oh try try it on the er assistant manager
B	that can be your deterrent yeah
A	now we're the best
D	oh good
A	House of Cards is back

B	that's convenient
A	mm?
D	anyway
A	okay
D	if you want an easy job
A	oh the actual inspector
D	or or er or some sort of er
D	you know a hi-vis
B	quality auditor or something
D	jacket with a helmet on and walk around the
A	yeah
D	walk around the site
A	that's what
D	I mean don't tell don't tell
A	easy money
D	there's only there was one or two of us actually doing things
D	pointing and
D	just farcical
B	it's crazy
A	well
D	it's so
A	years ago
D	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	who who are well-known I mean we'd heard of them but we didn't realise
A	you know didn't save a penny but yeah he said he his complaint at the end of the day was it was boring but you know
B	yeah yeah
A	you've got the power to do that if you say well things and he'd done it before he said and he'd come up against a lot of people
A	threatened to punch his lights out but he was a big you know fellow so he wasn't bothered but you've gotta that's why I think we
B	bit more authority about them
A	cos he was
B	a bit more of a presence
A	he was only in his he was kind of your age but he was a
B	do you find it a bit monotonous? or is it
D	no no it's quite it's quite enjoyable and er
A	oh really? have you enjoyed it?
D	well not enjoyable even
A	oh
D	sort of interesting in in a way
A	oh good
D	and it was nice weather
A	it's rained here
D	you know
A	for two days it's only been
D	well it was
A	nice today
D	it was clear sky yesterday
A	oh well that's good
D	and the previous day so
A	yeah
D	this morning it was a bit wet
A	with end caps on
D	you know out with with
A	oh they're nine hundred mil aren't they?
D	so quite big
A	or the are they
D	some are nine hundred
A	are they a metre or nine hundred?
D	some are some are nine hundred some are
A	so how many are you getting on a wagon? four or six?
D	four
A	only four?
A	so you got thirty-two pipes in this three days
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	ready to go
D	well well in you know in two day two and a half day er one and a half days because we didn't do anything on the first day other than clean pipes out and
A	but presumably
D	tidy up
A	if they're loaded on these wagons now
D	yes
C	cos they've got loads of
A	are they now costing money waiting to to go? is it
D	er
A	oh he's using so a different company okay
D	different company the transport you mean?
A	so he's got them loaded on yeah
D	yeah
A	well what are these cos these
D	that's right
A	are they they're surely we're
D	well I don't know they're ready for Monday morning so they've gotta go Monday and I I don't know whether there's any payment for the wagons
A	oh I see
D	but he's obviously paying the docks to store the pipes
A	yeah
D	an hour and that sort of thing cos there's six hundred pipes six hundred of these massive
A	he's just told me he's used
D	thirty about however many pipes
A	he's used all his money in the company to to release
D	plus his own money
A	what to release what he can
D	yeah
B	must be so much money going in and out of er
A	well he should er the customer should be paying
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so they pay eighty-five percent
A	and normally if they're gonna query anything it's that fifteen percent at the end
C	why haven't you had an invite? cos you've told them you won't go there?
D	we're away
C	huh?
D	we were we were away in Mauritius
A	but that eighty-five percent they they haven't paid it well that eighty-five percent pays the supplier pays the dock to release with the vat
B	oh
A	forget it
B	mm
A	that's what I did when I was in charge
B	they'll
A	end of story
B	and is he
D	and he's just hoping that they will pay next week some time
A	yeah yeah he's just again just
D	but
A	hoping they'll pay
D	they're gonna hang hang out as long as they want to
A	of course they are
D	yeah yeah
A	and you're talking millions he he
A	we went under when he did this before
D	a massive water company
A	wanting these pipes
B	it's like a multi multi-million pound
A	they're a
D	yeah
A	they're a
D	yeah
A	contractors
A	right well okay so
D	rather
A	you've got this so you've got
A	this big four million pound project four million is just the pipe supply
B	so for them it's
A	oh they've got loads more involved in this right? and they've got you can imagine now they've got contractors onsite they've got people ready they've got people digging trenches they've got big cranes they're digging out the trenches they've got maybe roads being blocked off and held up for pipes to go through they've got a lot of people involved on this right? if
A	they're gonna last a week ten days but
B	so apart from obviously ruining
D	apparently
B	cash flow is he is he also losing money from
A	yeah
D	well he's having to pay people to erm like me
B	to
D	to go up there and help him
A	yeah yeah and it's
D	clean the pipes
A	and it's gonna cost him
B	yeah
A	the fact that he's had wagons now loaded those wagons whether he was loading them yesterday
D	yeah well he started it yeah
A	right well that wagon now can't go anywhere that that
D	well he the the bloke
A	cannot use that wagon
B	mm
A	for anything else now until it delivers the stuff
B	so he'll be charging for that
A	so of course he'll be charging
D	yeah but er but erm the bloke that
A	that that's a
D	or
A	that's a
D	can we get out before Monday?
A	yeah
D	and er they were
A	yeah
D	trying to organise that
A	yeah
D	but I don't think they can
A	yeah
D	but er
A	that's okay
D	yeah mm
A	because they don't expect to be able to deliver to commercial sites over the weekend
D	yeah yeah
A	but if they're loading Wednesday Thursday you can guarantee they are charging Wednesday Thursday Friday rates
D	mm mm mm
A	they might not charge you Saturday and Sunday
D	mm
A	but they'll charge you for first thing Monday morning again
D	mm mm
B	on the whole project?
D	four million pounds project
A	I dunno what his margin was
D	but then but then
A	yeah
D	he said then he said well we might make a quarter of what we expected to make
A	okay
D	that was it
A	he's never had to run a project this size cos
D	mm but
D	yeah but erm
A	involved
D	he's doing
A	I know
D	do something
A	but
D	but apparently er
A	oh right
A	so they haven't got the contract to
B	are they gonna pay?
A	right
D	so that's what he says
A	but if they haven't got the contract to lay the pipe
D	mm
A	they have not then got all those costs I just told you they had therefore they can hang on as long as they like
D	mm
A	okay well that's a small cost but if they're not
D	mm mm
A	digging trenches and manpower and people hanging around to do things
B	and that would ruin
A	yeah yeah
B	is it not a legal obligation? is it not
A	well yeah you have to
B	contractual?
A	yeah yeah
A	so you've got you've got so basically the bank's holding the money so when this company
B	mm mm
A	it comes to the bank and the bank then according to the Letter of Credit it says right you need to pay X amount to the supplier in Turkey
D	for the bank
A	for the bank
D	yeah
A	so the customer's got peace of mind that they're not just handing over eighty-five percent and getting nothing
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah? so the bank
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	with we it's happened a million times but
D	mm
A	and it was held at the docks and it was held at the docks for
D	mm
D	mm yeah
A	two thousand and
D	it was a sewer pipe as well
A	it didn't get laid in time it didn't get laid in time that particular pipe cos we did quite a lot of the works on the Olympics and erm
B	it's eating into the profits
A	I can't tell you I can't
B	yeah
A	reiterate enough
B	mm
A	we're now losing
D	and the the other thing with this is as well
A	and I think they paid
D	yeah
A	they paid at the end
D	mm
A	of Feb so we lost and and
D	yeah
A	they paid and they took it but that was a that was a gamble and it did pay off but
B	can you not charge the company for the delay? I mean that's
A	oh yeah you can try they're not paying
D	you can try
A	they're not paying it
B	oh
D	or or the suppliers
D	for the
B	can you not get in the
A	yes
B	you?
A	yes
D	or you can be or
A	we had
D	consign charge the people who made the pipes for cos they've turned up without ends on and they're all dirty
A	yeah
D	try try and charge that if you want
A	they're
B	and then
A	forget it
D	but but
A	you you we we have tried
D	the big er
A	and we have
D	oh dear
D	mm
A	solicitors take all the money and by the time it gets to court a company like us
B	it wasn't worth it?
A	you have no
B	you get crushed by that
A	you you yeah you you can't you have nothing left we've learnt that over and over again the contracts are in place because they have to be but if you have to enforce it forget it
D	the the the big
A	hold your hands up and go under
D	the bigger problem with all this is that erm
A	mm
D	nine hundred are turning up on the
A	turning up
D	nineteenth of March
A	the next lot
D	a week
B	and these are big pipes?
D	these are again the same
A	well they're
D	it's the same again
A	they're this they're this diameter
D	plus half as much
A	thirteen and a half metres long
C	here we are
D	yes
A	so each
D	across
B	it's
D	the road from here
B	yeah yeah it's like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	each one
A	you have
D	down the drive
A	so you imagine handling each one of these you know it's a it's a big job that's why you only get four on a wagon
D	mm
A	so you're moving so you're getting nine hundred how many wagons is that?
D	so you're getting nine hundred
B	so should you be charging?
D	another the same again
B	or or is it just
A	no well
B	is it hard to?
A	he comes up
B	is it competitive?
A	with the price he comes up with with the price
B	mm
A	and that's what we go with but
B	so you need to incorporate this kind of wastage cost to try and
A	I did contingency fund oh won't put that in won't put that in well it's gonna go
D	be be more competitive price
A	but do
A	yeah always
B	are there lots of companies out there that if you don't offer that competitive price they will
A	er more so now than there was we were the only ones that provided the steel pipes so we didn't have the competition
B	so then you could charge the higher price?
A	but
C	dad
D	hello?
C	internet's rubbish
D	yeah I know
C	mm
D	I know it's not very good
C	no it's okay just slow and
A	the the the problem is are they gonna choose steel?
B	is there
A	we don't
B	or not
A	get anything from India or China which is where all the the glut is cos it is it's rubbish
B	it's naff quality?
A	it's really poor yeah yeah so it it doesn't just doesn't
B	fair enough
A	er
D	mm
B	yeah
D	it's amazing they just
A	cos we can't make it pay
A	big pipes yeah
D	things and
A	I've sat in a few with a hard hat on having a photo taken
D	and erm
D	the they're they're rolled steel so they're like you you
A	yeah
D	you can see how it's made cos the the you can see
A	but this er
D	and there there's spinning and all that
A	spirally weld these ones?
D	yeah
A	they're spiral weld
D	yeah yeah
A	so you've got this this thing going right down
D	this line going and you can see
A	yeah
D	how they're made and then they coat them inside and out
A	yeah
D	and er and
A	coat them and line them
D	yeah so it's er and then er
A	so you you're inside it?
D	yes a little bit although not too much because normally it's
A	oh you didn't you couldn't walk right through it these? are they a bit small for that?
D	oh you could crawl
A	well no you could get through them yeah
D	you could crawl I could crawl down
A	that's what I thought you might be doing
D	well
A	oh
D	but the trouble is what was happening
B	bit scary that
A	inside thirteen and a half metres of well
B	yeah
D	what was
D	happening was that erm you were
D	on the on the spray
A	I don't
D	it was pointless really it seemed to me
A	did did he did he say why? because
B	what would you like?
C	just some cookies milk chocolate
B	anything else?
C	do you reckon that'll work?
B	what so get chocolate sauce or get chocolate to melt?
C	oh yeah get chocolate to melt
A	when when is this a water pipe or a sewage pipe?
D	water
A	water drinking water?
D	well I dunno
D	is it? I dunno yeah yeah
D	I dunno
A	so when when they put this pipeline together it gets dirty anyway
D	yeah well that's what er
A	and they have to blast it
D	what
D	yeah
A	they've gotta blast it at high speed
D	yeah yeah
A	with water to clean it er so
D	well this it's
A	there is no need there there there is
D	yeah well we don't need to this really
A	there is no need
D	but we do it because he wants us to do it
A	if it's sewage it doesn't matter and if it's water it's gotta be blasted anyway
D	mm
A	at high at high pressure
D	oh
C	does anybody want anything from the shop?
A	no thanks
D	I
B	you sure?
A	no
D	no
C	yeah if you buy like a bag then
A	but that that's what I don't understand the need for that
D	or they would nick apparently somebody said they were nicked but then I'm not sure that's quite who'd wanna nick an end cap? well I dunno
A	I dunno
B	have I left my coat
C	I dunno you'll have to have a look at my coat as well in a minute
C	huh?
C	no it's really nice
C	that and then my erm
B	it keeps bleeping
D	they were using er
A	oh they were using er
D	well only because there's
A	but the
D	hessian type things and er
A	yeah
A	well because spigot and socket ends are different sizes we do but
D	oh yeah but the
A	does
D	these are these are big hessian sack things
A	does
D	really huge
A	that the company that makes them is in Glasgow?
D	erm
A	so that should he
D	well we had
A	should he
D	we had really you know mm
A	should but I'm thinking when his next
D	yeah yeah the same
A	if he gives this Glasgow company an order now
D	mm
A	he'd be able to pick them up and he'll have them ready to put on is what I'm thinking
D	mm
A	I should have mentioned that to him when
D	he's erm
A	I saw him outside a minute ago
D	I think probably he er
A	yeah
D	pretty ropey and some
A	yeah
D	some people were there last week doing the what we were we were doing it was er
A	what people for
D	yeah yeah and they were just er I dunno what they were doing but erm some of the stuff they'd
A	well the end caps
D	rubbish
A	aren't pricey but they they do sell I mean because you can put those end caps on any type of pipe
D	mm yeah
A	and all pipes are supposed to be stored like that when it's
C	what's he paying you dad?
D	I think it's about fourteen pound an hour
A	do you know how many hours you've clocked up this week?
C	and do you get a lunch break?
A	eighteen hours
D	not really he'll probably pay
A	no
D	nine to five won't he? so er nine to five eight hours and then eight hours on or about nine hours on
A	eight eight nine
D	er eight nine and today how many today hours? I think we started at
A	twenty-three hours
D	eight nine
A	about twenty-three hours you've done
D	yeah
A	okay
C	so what's that?
D	twenty-three times fourteen so it'll be that's about
A	fourteen pound an hour
D	two hundred and
A	work it out
D	dunno it's about er it's over three hundred and fifty quid something dunno three hundred and twenty quid
C	three hundred and twenty-two
A	okay that's alright then
D	nice yeah
A	oh was it?
D	it was just a
A	have a nice meal and
C	standard yeah we had a had a little
C	and a bar
A	oh
C	quite posh yeah
A	so would you ever
D	but he was thinking of cos he's
A	no
D	we're not getting the money
A	not for no no
D	he can't afford it so he
A	so what that
D	oh
A	what happened when he was in a caravan
D	well usual sort of thing where we found this
D	caravan site so we
A	who found the caravan site?
D	towards the
A	oh
D	prepared to go to it
A	oh
D	he's the one going on
A	yeah yeah yeah he said yeah
D	or Sunday afternoon
A	mm
D	I mean I could go but I'm not because
A	yeah
A	you don't want to
D	I'm tired
A	yeah fair enough yeah
D	I'm tired now after everything
A	okay so what what
D	so he said erm
A	right
D	to hire this caravan a static
A	right
D	I suppose but a few
A	yeah
D	few bed few few beds because
D	who work for
A	oh er
D	er I dunno what the dunno what
A	okay
D	his connection is anyway
A	mm mm
D	so
A	yeah
D	a lot less and he's
A	yeah
D	gotta pay for the hotel
A	yeah
D	so cost us a thousand pounds just now for
A	yeah yeah
D	the three of us for
A	yeah
D	three nights
A	did he
D	four of us
A	did he pay all the food and all the accommodation?
D	he did yeah yeah
A	you spent anything?
D	about a tenner or something on drinks
A	mm
D	but that's about it
A	oh right
D	I think
A	well so when he got the Calor gas did he give you the credit card or?
D	I gave them a credit card yeah yeah
A	his credit card?
D	yeah well no the
A	yeah his yeah so it's still the same
D	yeah
A	code I bet
A	and
D	had to go and get er
A	yeah
D	gas I had to go and get some
A	so go on then so
D	lunch
A	so you went to the caravan?
D	well no we didn't get that far we got within
A	oh
D	half a mile of it
A	yeah
D	and
A	oh right
D	and er
A	this far away?
D	because we
A	yeah
D	the wagons rolling and that sort of thing
A	yeah yeah
D	so we're not gonna well we won't go to this and
A	yeah
D	well I don't mind don't mind
A	yeah yeah
D	you know it's fine so
A	he's a good bloke isn't he? he's a nice bloke
D	yeah he's a very nice bloke
A	yeah
D	I
A	no he's too big
D	he's a
A	no I know no no
D	he's
A	he's a he's a big
D	stomach out here
A	little round fella
D	a stomach out here
A	shorter than
D	and he walks along like a penguin and
A	yeah I know
D	he can't he can't
A	he's a he's a he's a very
D	do anything
A	pleasant chap though he's a nice
D	oh yes oh yeah a nice bloke yeah
A	yeah yeah
D	yeah absolutely very
A	no
D	chatty and sort of you know
A	well you can't get you're even
D	well yeah well yeah that's right that's what he wants and er
D	they couldn't climb up any pipes or anything like that I think he's got no chance
A	oh no oh well no
D	like it was just it was it was farcical cos they
D	they were
A	couldn't clean the inside of a pipe and
D	the hi-vis the the hi-vis brigade they were just basically directing operations and
A	oh no
D	chatting about you know oh they they just
D	a load of rubbish half the time and then they decide they're gonna do something different from the five minutes ago they decided something else and so on
A	yeah
D	it's just
A	yeah
D	it's just
A	you're just doing as you're told okay that's fair enough
D	well I was just you know just
A	yeah well yeah that's all you can do it's not
D	er yes I was but
A	you you you don't know the business though
D	but also I was I was thinking well
A	yeah
D	the the the erm the pipe
A	on the docks?
D	yeah
A	mm
D	mobile crane but more like a
A	yeah
D	more an arm it was
A	yeah yeah
D	and it had this big erm vacuum suction thing
A	oh the suction ones
D	they're really
A	they're good aren't they?
D	they're good
A	they're impressive those things
D	they are yeah yeah
A	yeah they are I've seen
D	pick up these huge
D	he'd got these three down there
A	yeah
D	and then what he was doing was picking them up
A	yeah
D	erm
A	yeah
D	or one end off cos the other end was already off
A	yeah
D	and then he'd tilt it slightly
A	yeah
D	we'd spray it
A	oh I see
D	and sometimes get inside do
A	oh so you've got somebody working a crane for you?
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	so that's costing you?
D	presume so yeah yeah
A	oh
D	I dunno
A	yeah
D	so it's er it's
D	yeah and he's there
A	I thought you were just doing them on the ground
D	well we we couldn't er
A	cos those suction things are
D	some of them we can't get to
A	flipping expensive
D	cos they're either there or
A	just had to
D	get the the cover the the end off because it's been rammed
A	yeah
D	against another pipe so you have to get them out
A	wow
D	and do them as they load them pretty much most of them
A	pointless though it's a pointless exercise
D	well
A	well I'd have it's like I'd have had them sat saying well they go back to Turkey if you don't sign the Letter of Credit and pay end of story
D	mm
A	we'll sort them out onsite do what you like you've gotta blast them anyway
D	well yeah
A	yeah
D	and erm they usually apparently repair those onsite
A	yes yes
D	and before we came away we had to repair it and we have to
A	what with the patches?
D	patching them and a
A	blowtorch
D	blowtorch yeah
A	so you've learnt how to do repair patches then?
D	well I saw
A	so
D	but I didn't do it
A	so hang on so you you didn't get as far as the caravan site then?
D	no no we we turned round about with about half a mile to go
A	and
D	cos
A	so what what where's
D	Premier Inn
A	which is where you've been?
D	no
A	no?
D	no this is a closer one
A	the Premier Inn they'll do
A	they'll do for three hundred quid a week?
D	well
A	yeah
D	I said well you
A	yeah yeah
D	two months you could get a really better cos they do
A	yeah
D	it for twenty-nine pound a week or a night or something if you if you book a lot
A	that was Travelodge are they the same are they?
D	oh I don't know
A	yeah
A	well I hope he does
D	yes
A	so he's how many people
D	it's
A	has he got going up next week?
D	this
D	he's staying for the whole week and then
A	right
D	well that's a good question really
A	is he on the payroll or is he subcontracted to
D	says he tells me he's self-employed
A	he's self-employed is he? I'm not sure what he was doing oh right
D	but he's clearly sort of er
A	well if he's
D	you know
A	self-employed
A	yes he he's been in the business a while he's
D	yeah
A	he's done valves and stuff he's been in that sort of industry but self-employed yeah so he's gonna be course he's gonna go up isn't it? easy money now
D	yeah yeah
A	he's gonna be raking it in I didn't realise I I couldn't remember
A	if he was self-employed
D	yeah yeah yeah he's
A	mm yeah
D	angry about things
D	but he's quite he's his normal self type of thing you know
A	has anybody been there from the customers?
D	we had a couple of suits turn up today
A	mm
D	and well the nobody seemed to know where they were from to be honest
A	oh
D	a consultancy
A	they were the consultancy?
D	they thought they were a pipe
A	they they
D	I I don't think so no
A	they were the consultants?
D	no I
A	right
D	and stuff so I dunno whether he's there as a pipe inspector and he was putting a few
A	I can't believe that you know the fact that they're stalling is just standard but
D	yeah
A	should not be shipping a single pipe out of there
D	well this this is d√©j√† vu isn't it? cos you were
A	this is gonna be
D	the
A	oh the
D	but the thing is with it the thing obviously there's another nine hundred coming and then another
A	try ones in the cupboard
D	and then another ship after that as well apparently another dunno how many more after that but the but there's not room on the dock now
A	on the dock together no
D	to put nine hundred more on there so
A	well they're expecting those
D	we've gotta shift them out quickly
A	well he'll have that small window of opportunity at the end of the month with the vat return but
C	are you having any mum?
D	what are you having?
C	with the
D	er not for me
D	I've had enough food
C	mum?
A	no thank you
D	thank you
C	yeah we're
D	yes?
C	you know the
D	we
C	warm cookie and
D	okay
C	erm
D	oh well I don't want any ice cream but I'll have that
C	you've got Galaxy?
D	oh well done
A	oh there's a bar of that in there oh and the oh look at that
D	look at that
A	excellent good man you've bought a bigger bar I think than I've got
D	there was another erm
A	could you make a coffee
C	well I'm gonna do this first
D	there's another erm contract after this
A	yes
D	well no with
A	oh
A	oh oh oh yes oh they haven't right no cos he I think
D	yes yes er he
A	well yes because they're they're in that particular phase of the
D	yeah and erm
A	good
A	oh this this was the best thing we Letter of Credit was the best way we ever had
D	yeah
A	we've kept that company afloat but Letter of Credit
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	after what he did before
D	yeah
A	oh I I feel bad but he doesn't really want my help anymore but
D	well it's not your
A	it's not my thing now but I just wanna just get in and say listen no
D	yes but well er all that'll do is make you
A	yeah
D	cause you grief you're not
A	yeah no no but that that's that's grief on a that's not like erm grief with the situation with
D	mm
A	but that's different
B	would you go back
A	no
D	that's what I mean cos you you wouldn't agree with anything he does cos he's
A	no I know
D	I mean I mean you've already as you've already
A	I know
D	you know you'd to be telling to him don't bother to clean the pipes because
A	well no and but
D	yeah
A	you you you've gotta you've gotta blast the pipe at high pressure before it's and and test PH levels and everything so a little bit of dirt in it now
C	mm mm mm
A	you've gotta blast it to check all the joints hold blahdy blahdy blah you know before
D	I think he thinks they'll look at the pipe and think oh they're dirty I'll send them back but they're not gonna send them back unless they remove them
A	but now if they haven't got a contract in place or anybody actually digging trenches blahdy blah at the moment I could understand why they're
D	I think it was something like that
A	stalling
D	or or it might be something on they can't get them off the lorries or something stupid
A	you see because
D	they haven't arranged half the things
A	no
D	the the other end
A	because before
D	which
A	obviously when when they've got gangs of men waiting they're paying those gangs of men
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	so the longer they're stalling getting the pipes the more they're paying out that in the end they just
D	yeah
A	pay the pipe and you get it done but if they haven't got those gangs waiting
D	mm
A	they're not losing money therefore they're not in any hurry to
D	no no
A	oh yeah
D	and back
A	yeah yeah
A	sure yeah
A	and you only want the crane to break down one end or the other which they do often the suction things break down a lot
D	oh right
A	crane that end and then you've got the crane the other end
D	mm
A	one of those breaks down that stops you for a day or two
D	well the because of the this this next delivery he's talking about erm you're working all Easter weekend so he's er asking all these big blokes the crane driver and the lorry drivers if you wanna if you wanna go and work
A	bung a few quid
D	and they said fine yeah we we'll we don't have holidays necessarily if there's work to do
A	mm
D	we'll do it
A	they'll do it
D	because we like the money type thing so
B	yeah
A	would you make coffee?
C	oh mum needs a coffee
B	yes
A	er my cup's just there look by the
D	it's your
A	thanks
D	so erm
C	dad do you want one?
D	yes go on then I'll have one thank you
C	seriously?
D	he's obviously easy going and he goes away for an hour or two and comes back some five hours later
A	what
D	yeah
A	doesn't do a lot
A	yeah that's why it is easy money for
D	yeah oh yeah

D	er and he's staying that weekend apparently
A	oh right
C	he's been inviting us for to

A	yeah sure he does
D	dunno whether there's anybody there
