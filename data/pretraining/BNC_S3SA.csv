A	the bathroom one is stuck I think what they did they were trying to lock it or something and the
B	oh it's stuck on that slightly open thing
A	yeah yeah
B	well when you have some money just get somebody in who can do repairs on it
B	don't say you need a new window ask them if show them what
A	wonder if
B	well they'll tell you won't they they'll just tell you just ask them
A	mm
B	cos it's like a vacuum isn't it between two windows?
A	I don't know how they're going to clean it though because it probably needs cleaning it's got
B	well it would need opening up wouldn't it?
A	yeah
B	so they they'd unseal it open it up do what they need to do and seal it again
A	cos
B	well yeah they're looking at
A	no I would have preferred the
B	yeah it doesn't matter
A	yeah because it's cheaper
B	mm
C	that's my window
B	yeah most other people have white don't they?
C	mm with the bonsai that's my bonsai
B	it's looking very big for a bonsai
C	well it it got erm
B	they start looking like a tree but it just looks like a plant
C	well it's a pachira one so they grow it's like a palm tree style
B	mm
C	do you know what I mean? erm so they do
C	and we've chucked
B	yeah but normally they grow big but that's the whole point of the art of bonsai that you have to you have to know what you're doing as well
C	I know but I kept chopping the leaves but the leaves just kept growing big
B	it's not just the leaves it's the branches
C	I don't not no but it's not got branches it's got a trunk
A	it's probably just a cheaper one it was only three ninety-nine
C	no it is a bonsai it's a proper one
B	yeah but they have things coming off the trunk
C	yeah
B	like when you you cut back quite low maybe to keep it
C	but then I'd cut all the leaves off
B	yeah but then it stops it eventually then it starts getting older and
C	oh
B	you know it
C	I don't yeah I don't know cos it just
B	there is a way of doing it properly
C	cos it said just keep trimming the leaves cos it said this one that I've got is quite easy to look after
B	oh
C	and
B	but it might be better just letting it grow it would be nice if it grows big like
C	I know I think I'll just because some people have erm
B	those
C	cos some people have erm them you know quite big as a house plant
B	mm yeah
C	but they do actually grow like into a big tree and I don't want it to grow that big
B	no well you then you clip it down when it's getting a bit
C	yeah yeah I think it would be quite nice big
B	yeah they're nice big
C	but
B	popular the big ones yeah
C	it's like erm a plaited trunk or something they like when it's grown when it's small they're like
B	so it's like goes round like that
C	mm
B	oh that'll be good
C	like you can see it a bit
B	oh yeah yeah you can see it starting to do that oh that'll be lovely
C	they are they are really big so
A	yeah
B	oh right
C	I don't know like it is getting bigger and I don't know how to keep it small so I thought I might let it get a bit bigger but I don't want it to be kind of
B	no well keep trimming it as you are
C	I don't want it to be
A	going to have to bring it out here
C	I know I didn't think it would grow out here yeah
B	well it would probably die it would die wouldn't it? cos you you that's just an indoor one isn't it? cos it needs to be warm probably
C	yeah
A	keep in the thingy house
C	in the green a massive greenhouse
B	I expect we'll head off soon what time is it?
C	erm
B	well we better had cos by the time we get to the shops and stuff there's a recycling place open till eight
B	I was just a bit worried that might be closed
C	yeah
B	so even if we arrived late we can erm still
C	well it won't take you long to get a present just go in and pick one and get it
B	no I know what I'm getting for
C	yeah? right good because I know what you're like in shops
B	I don't think I'm going to go to
C	you always you always blame it on me
B	it is you
C	it's not me
B	it was you when I go to the supermarket
C	you were you were ages the other day buying them pizzas
B	how do you know?
C	cos when you rang me and by the
B	oh I told you I was on the way
C	yeah
B	well I was looking for
B	you have to remember I start late in the day
C	yeah
B	because when I'm working till midnight and I go to bed at like two or three in the morning
C	yeah and also yeah I can just imagine that you wake up and you're like right I'm going to have my tea and some biscuits going to
B	yeah I need at least two cups of tea
C	going to watch the TV for a bit and like when you do your ironing I can just imagine you iron a shirt then you have a sit down and have another cup of tea or something watch a bit of the TV or do a bit more ironing
B	have you been spying on me?
C	and that's why
B	that's why it takes you a long time so you do things very slowly you have quite a slow paced lifestyle
A	well he doesn't have to rush is it? he doesn't have kids he's single he can do whatever he wants
B	I do have what do you mean I have a child?
B	but yeah you in the supermarket you drive me mad
B	you're not coming with me when I go into the shop
C	it took us two hours in Scotland to do the
A	how come you're always so fast?
C	I know yeah
B	but
C	oh I think I think the problem is you know when I say stuff to you like oh look at that you just keep walking so I'm just like having a look
A	that's smart
B	and then she start talks non stop and my brain can't think of what I need to say
B	drives me mad
C	I didn't you just just ignore me so it's alright but father's like mm mm like
C	yeah it's quite good actually
B	and you're probably thinking oh I'm not being ignored I'm encouraging you
C	yeah
B	so yeah
C	what kind of cereal do you think I should get?
B	well why? if I get one porridge you don't want porridge every day but why don't you get like a chocolaty one like
C	yeah yeah what cereals shall I get?
B	Coco Pops
A	are you asking me which cereal to get for the holiday?
C	yeah
B	you're not a toddler anymore you're you're an adult
C	I know but
A	Weetos with the little toy in it
A	I don't think
C	I used to love getting a toy in the
B	well everyone does that
C	no but do you know how many people they would erm wait to see whose cereal it would come out in? and they'd pour their cereal and they'd wait to see whose cereal it was going to come out in
B	probably cos their parents wouldn't let them stick their hands in
B	and if you're in a family of with children
C	yeah like
B	it's alright when you're the only child and no one else is going to grab it
B	so what do you want?
C	erm
A	Coco Pops
C	yeah
B	oh that's what I got you last time
C	did you? multi cereal?
B	yeah I think I got the multi ones
C	the little boxes they're good
C	yeah
A	he's so good
C	but but they said Talktalk said that erm they're going to be regulating it aren't they?
A	mm
C	for for
B	what? is it not good here with Talktalk?
C	no
A	was good until today
C	but for ten days they said that your speed and connection can fluctuate while we decide on the best one for you
B	oh right
C	while you've just got it installed
A	well this is not the best one
C	I know yeah
B	what?
C	this isn't good whatever they're doing at the moment
A	this is not the best one now
B	right
C	it was good the first day
B	yeah but as long as they're going to get it right after a while
C	if they don't we'll have to complain
A	that's all I'm doing since I moved here
C	do you know what we're having for dinner? mm? no I hope it's something that I like
B	no I didn't ask
A	look he just made that child cry again this is the third time now
C	yeah do you know all day they just scream at it and it
A	yeah I thought they have a dog or something they speak they speaking to the child like that
B	it's only a baby practically isn't it? a little toddler
A	it is it's a little toddler I think cos he talks now

A	the one next door these are the
B	oh right
C	yeah
B	oh
C	yeah no no never
A	them two them two they're not shouting they're yelling
C	they're like screaming yeah
A	that's how he's going to grow up that's how he's going to speak to people and teachers and everybody that's why you get these kids at school yelling at you
B	that's probably how they were brought up isn't it?
A	yeah well yeah

B	I saw this this morning I don't know where where they've done while we've been here
C	what?
B	see that big scratch all the length of the car?
B	well somebody would have to put something on it and walk past and scratch it oh unless it unless it was a branch I hit or something
C	it comes off
B	does it?
C	er isn't it?
B	well it could have been a branch you know? cos I did hit a branch you know? on that country lane that
C	oh yeah I think it comes off
B	I know get some windows open
C	it's quite nice though I I really like warm cars I don't know why
B	do you?

B	oh it's too hot in here
C	like cos it's got like a a really like warm car smell
B	warm car smell

B	right erm just trying to think
C	you sure you want these windows open? we're going to get blown away
B	no you're okay on these roads but when we're on the motorway we won't be able to
C	yeah
B	I'll open the back ones let's see what it's like that they get going put the front ones up if you want?
C	yeah no it was just like I had that erm stuff and I was like
B	yeah that's nice of you she'll be pleased with that
C	yeah cos I have little things like that and I'm just like I never know what to do with them and then sometimes if like one of my friends has like a a sibling or like someone else like ah I've got this I I go to visit or something but
B	yeah it's handy stuff like that you're not going to use them
C	yeah
B	so er pass them on do you want your window up?
C	er no it's alright so far and then yeah and mummy's got like
C	got like loads of beads and things and she's got some Disney princesses so everyone like Disney princesses
B	yeah everyone loves them don't they?
C	do you like Disney princess?
B	you just said everyone loves them
B	oh that's the shop that's near
C	yeah
B	wondered where the M6 was
C	erm I don't have Incredibles
B	oh Incredible yeah what what have you got?
B	you've got erm
C	I've got like them princess ones
B	no but you've got the one with the hamster haven't you?
C	yeah well we watched that last time Bolt
B	oh did we?
C	yeah well we brought all those
B	you got anything else like that?
C	I've got Bolt and I've got Ratatouille and we watched that last time as well
B	oh yeah right
C	and I've got Monsters versus Aliens which we watched last time
B	did we?
C	yeah I've brought all these
B	I can't remember watching them
C	and I've got all like
C	I've got some
C	yeah I'd never
B	yeah don't go
C	yeah they were quite good actually those long films I can't remember what they were now have we not watched them together? I should I brought them round to yours once
C	I know yeah that school bus
B	yeah why didn't he stay still till I repositioned myself?
C	I think Laurel and Hardy is so good
B	yeah well I'll if I bring my boxset that'll that's plenty then isn't it?
C	yeah
B	don't need anything else
B	mm
C	erm and I'd never seen it before I don't oh no oh had I? no I hadn't
B	on that website did you say there was a website?
C	oh yeah yeah do you know I watched it was really good the erm ah what was it? Robinson Crusoe one it was like I think it was like based on that or something
B	yeah
C	erm and Laurel and Hardy yeah on her website with free films on it cos it's got adverts so it's it's legal
B	oh right yeah
C	and they just have like some old ones or you know? like ones like small budget films or something like not anything new
B	yeah
C	but they had a Laurel and Hardy and it was really good
B	yeah
C	they went to an island and then it was and then people didn't have then they made it like a country and people didn't have to
B	mm
C	and it was like really crowded it was funny
B	I don't think I've ever seen that one
C	and then I think they wanted to like bring back tax or something and the like people like rebelled and then
B	mm
C	was funny yeah it was good
B	yeah I wonder if films are going to be like books you know? copyright it must come under the same law mustn't it?
C	yeah
B	you know they're eventually they they can't they're out of copyright
C	yeah
B	so really like old films have come down in price where the only cost is the the actual packaging really
C	yeah yeah
B	cos well I guess they make some profit but they don't have to pay anybody the writers and what have you do they?
C	because
B	don't know how it works I don't know how old it is
C	yeah I'm not sure how it works
B	I don't know how old it has to be it's about is it around a hundred years anyway isn't it?
C	probably but like cos there's some films and things you can watch on Youtube and Youtube's quite strict about copyright and stuff
B	mm
C	so like if it was violating copyright Youtube would take it down
B	yeah
C	but there are some on Youtube and you can watch them
B	what? like old ones?
C	yeah but I don't know erm I don't know I think there's some cartoons on Youtube that I've watched
B	books?
C	yeah because they're out of copyright because you can read them online
B	yeah so that's the same with film
C	yeah
B	somebody would have a site where they're all free you know? the ones out of copyright
C	there probably is yeah
B	although I mean the way people watch films now most of them go to like a lot of people go to illegal websites and download them anyway don't they
C	yeah yeah
B	it's kind of like I suppose with music it has affected music cos so many people do music
C	yeah
B	you know? they can't they they they make very little money out of music sales now pop stars I think most of the money is from like concerts
C	yeah the concerts they make the money from yeah
B	whereas in the past they used to make most of their money out of record sales
C	yeah not enough people sell the
B	yeah do you pay a subscription though?
C	you can either you can have it free with adverts
B	yeah
C	which I think I think is like and you also it's like
B	oh right
C	you can't you can click on an artist and have all their songs play or an album and have all the songs play but you can't choose like specific songs to play
B	yeah so it's quite random yeah
C	you know what I mean? and you can't you have to listen to them online and if you pay you can er have them on your phone
B	you get to choose yeah
C	you can listen offline no adverts
B	yeah
C	and erm you can choose a specific song but it
B	yeah but you never own it do you? you just pay to listen to it yeah
C	yeah but
B	yeah they pay royalties
C	yeah so I think that's quite good like I don't know like that's quite reasonable I think
B	yeah
C	so I don't know why people are still like downloading and then like on Youtube you can watch the music video and then they get money from that
B	yeah
C	not all of them are on but
B	I really don't buy a lot of music but I think I'd rather still buy like a CD and same with like films have the DVD and just have it there and you can put it on when you want
C	yeah
B	it's like really old people who start like to listen to the music on the wind up gramophone
C	yeah I kind of want to is that nice? is that a good sound? or is that a bit?
B	I've never heard it on a wind up gramophone
C	cos I really like the look of them
C	yeah
B	have you never listened to it online?
C	no
B	well
C	cos I
C	but I'd want to be buying like Beethoven or something I don't like I don't like the pop ones
B	mm
C	obviously like cos they have pop ones
B	but you're thinking like the old fashioned gramophones
C	yeah
B	from like victorian era
C	and put like Mozart on
B	but the difficulty with that would be I don't know how it works do you have to keep winding it? or do you er? do you just wind it up a bit
C	I think I think you wind it and then once the record's finished I think you
B	because it may be a thing
C	yeah there is yeah yeah
B	to get the right sound but you can probably buy a record player with that style of like speaker
C	yeah that does it itself
B	mm
C	they're never erm like classical yeah
C	but
B	yeah there are there is a bit of a comeback for vinyl but people who are starting to buy it sort of buy more recent stuff
C	yeah yeah yeah because new albums come out on vinyl sometimes
B	yeah
C	but yeah I've never seen classical ones because I was thinking obviously back in when they had the wind up gramophones what would they be playing? they'd be playing classical
B	yeah
C	so they must exist but I've never seen them
B	yeah you can probably get
C	yeah
B	the places
C	I couldn't be bothered
B	oh
C	and obviously all the erm all the classical stuff's free on Youtube
B	oh right yeah
C	Mozart and stuff
B	yeah cos it's all out of copyright
C	although like you think you'd still have to play the the instrument player
B	what do you mean?
C	cos someone's playing that like in modern day aren't they? to be recorded someone's playing the piano someone's in the orchestra
B	yeah well
C	yeah cos like well whoever well
B	well no I mean you do get new releases orchestras
C	yeah and you have to like you you pay for those
B	ah
C	but I don't know what are the what are the free ones are on Youtube don't know who that is
B	oh right I see what you mean yeah
C	yeah
B	not sure where you
C	just follow that car in front of us
B	not sure where you get this Sainsbury's it's all changed here now since the tram
C	probably
B	I am yeah
C	well you can't get on that one now wow look at that bridge a glass bridge
B	Sainsbury's should be here to the left somewhere I think
C	oh I like Sainsbury's
B	is it there? can you see it? yeah it's on that road there can we go there? yeah
C	don't know
B	does it feel strange being back here?
C	no I like I can't remember it
B	can you not?
C	no
B	really?
C	yeah it's just like any place
B	well if you're in
C	yeah like
B	you weren't here that often really you know? around here
C	oh TK Maxx and I like their like I always look at their notebooks they have nice notebooks I've only bought one once though because the amount of times that I've seen nice notebooks in TK Maxx if I'd bought one every time I would just I'd just like
B	well
B	you were telling me
B	you seem to be getting a bit excited
C	well I need to look for something for grandad
B	I know
B	how are you going to get your grandad's?
C	well I mean I can
B	well I can give you
C	no because that's that means I've still have not got much money I'm not
