A	we were on one side of the shop because we went out of the shop on the way down for the train station and dad was pushing a pushchair and
B	yeah
A	cos if anyone's going to let her run on the road it'll be you two
B	it's
A	no well she's not got reins round she's got like a little backpack that little orange one she puts her toys in it it's got a string on the back so you just hold her so she can't run off
B	where she
A	if it stops them running into the road and getting run over or
B	exactly I mean that's the whole point it means they can still toddle but you don't have to hold their hand the entire time or stand stand on top of them the entire time
A	yeah
B	and you can keep them at arm's length
A	yeah I mean especially like if it's just like if it's just like me
B	it'll be
A	oh really?
B	I really don't
D	now you imagine them to be a really strict culture don't you?
A	yeah I was going to say that
B	yeah no when it comes to
A	they're a bit more lax
B	they don't discipline them at all you go to a restaurant sometime they'll be running around screaming and doing whatever and yeah health and safety-wise they're not very strict with things like that you're often climbing over they'll have playgrounds and
B	I don't think if a child gets hurt in school typically it's not still not typical for the parents to blame the school they're just like well children hurt themselves it just happens
A	mm
B	so like some things they're more
A	yeah
B	so you'll see really little ones though taking themselves to school sometimes and you're like ah bless them
A	really see I mean in in this country I mean I'm already worried about
B	yeah yeah
A	and that's four ways away it's four years away yet and I'm already I'm already worried about her walking on her own because because
B	yeah four years away yeah for
A	yeah
B	whereas yeah no by that point woah they're doing
A	yeah
B	by eleven they're allowed to walk around pretty freely it's all all kinds of times in the evening
A	oh right
B	erm yeah they're not so strict about that
A	yeah
B	really horrible they're just made to study until the early hours every morning they have a saying though in the last year of high school if you sleep for four hours you're
A	blimey
B	and it's like they make them go to these academies and send them to these lessons and stuff but there's no way they're still learning you're not you can't you know I've only got to sit down and read a textbook for an hour and I start to get tired and I stop taking information in so it's completely pointless
A	yeah
B	like it's not making them any more intelligent or anything it's just very competitive so
A	see that's the one of the when they had SATs at the end of this year because I never knew they did SATs at the end of year two
B	no it does have have they always done that?
A	I don't know cos
B	mm
A	and she's like well we do make a point not to make a big deal out of it because some parents will go and do stupid things like getting tutors and putting lots of pressure on them and at seven six and seven they don't need that and I'm like no that's fine but as a parent would it hurt for you to stick on the bottom of a newsletter children have got up-and-coming SATs tests at the end of year two you know?
B	it's not necessary
B	definitely
A	I mean I get
B	exactly exactly I think that's a big problem in our culture is that we're
A	yeah yeah
B	at all like there's one thing like you know being crazy about it but
A	I mean she reads every day without fail she has to read every day without fail
B	I think if you want your child to to to you know perform really well then you
A	yeah
B	cos otherwise they'll they're just you know
A	well that's like my
B	won't actually be able to
A	do you know what I mean? but but on the other hand I always think well if
A	it's like he still can't use a pencil because he's got really bad like muscle tone he'd
B	mm yeah well
A	well he's never going to learn to write then is he? if you give him if you take away any
B	I don't understand the laptop solution to problems now
A	exactly
B	dyslexic have a laptop well
A	and I and I understand yeah they've got to learn to be able to use computers and that because so much is technology is involved now in just normal everyday life but
B	yeah I mean
B	and it's like it's
A	and also what's the harm of him writing with a felt-tip pen if he has to?
B	has to
A	okay it's probably more of a pain in the bum if he makes mistakes and that but
B	it still gives him also it's regardless of what he can do in the future as a as a teenager or whatever
A	exactly
B	it's a confidence thing it doesn't matter if he gets a job or not it's just personal confidence
A	I mean he'll go to he's I mean it'll be senior school senior school he'll start next year
B	mm
A	and the
B	yeah they're going to mainstream them aren't they?
A	they've said now they're going to mainstream him and I think it'll do him the world of good because I think he'll be more he'll want to do more of what the more able children are
B	do yeah
A	he'll still have his one-on-one like specialist and he'll come out of he'll come out of
B	specialist yeah because they have a special needs departments
A	yeah he'll come out of his like regular class and go off to smaller groups you know one-on-one sessions and stuff like that but I do think I'm hoping that because he'll be seeing kids that are more capable he'll want to emulate them and hopefully it might make him a bit more
B	it'll make him more aware of what
A	exactly
D	and surely by encouraging him to use a pen he's going to build up
A	his muscle tone will get better anyway exactly
B	well yeah of course yeah
A	but just give him a laptop doing that and not only that but it makes me laugh they're always going on about how we can't hold a pen very well but he can play an Xbox and a PlayStation fine
B	yeah
A	well hang on a minute those pads can be pretty weighty after a while if he can do that and
B	of course they
A	and he can play DSs and everything else like that so his I think with
B	yeah
A	and also I think because he's more one of the abled children at his special needs school
B	yeah exactly he's probably top of his special needs school at the moment
A	yeah I mean you've got some kids there that like are in permanent wheelchairs can't you know even sit up on their own without being supported you know?
B	yeah
A	so I think because of that as well I think the school leave him to just get on with his to
B	yeah well
A	but then but then she should do
B	as well
A	take him out of the school then if you're not happy with it I mean change schools mention it go to you know well he's got a social worker for crying out loud take it up with them if you have to
B	oh yeah and as you said he she could be doing numerous things
A	she could do stuff at home with him it's just bone idleness isn't it though?
B	this is another thing people leave their entire care of their child and the education of the child down to the education system
A	to the school and then they blame the school when they don't do very well or something yeah
B	it's not you know you're the parent you're
A	I mean like I said I'm lucky that
B	yeah yeah yeah you
A	I mean it's not like I have to I'd have to force her to do it I mean some day she'll be like do I have to? like yesterday she didn't write her diary because by the time we got home and had our dinner it was late but then she'll but I'll make her write two days today
B	yeah she was tired yeah
A	because I'm horrible
B	no that's not I think that's a reasonable thing to do I've
A	yeah I mean one of the I mean at the end of every holiday well I always make a point of saying to her teacher what can we work on over the holidays? and what especially these longer holidays
B	yeah it's
A	especially with her arm being like it is we'd be doing even less anyway so we're not going out on the to the parks as much we're not going out on her bike
B	yeah
A	because she's just learned to ride her bike as well
B	ah I know ah
A	I couldn't believe that I was so worried about her falling off that bike
B	oh right
A	and so I rushed out getting her a new helmet thinking she's going to fall off that bike and smash her head
B	ah
A	but yeah but I don't but I always make a point of saying to her teacher what can we work on? and her head I mean her teacher said well you know she's really good at times tables but we want them to be quicker want them to be able to fire them off really fast you know?
A	so just keep just keep practising those do her homework because she's the teacher is always saying how good her writing is she said she loves that she's so
B	wow
A	and I'm
A	and I was like
A	I was like okay
B	you don't hardly know what a simile is until you're in secondary school
A	she knows what she knows what a simile is she knows what they are
B	she's got a really good teacher I think that she's taking care of that yeah because there's no because
A	yeah her teacher's lovely her teacher's lovely and I did and she's sitting there marking it going you didn't
A	it's embarrassing when your seven-year-old
B	there's there's no way that all
A	yeah
B	and I remember at English masters every year we'd be sat in kind of rows and erm each row was of a certain ability and you you're all set different textbooks and different things yeah
A	yeah I
B	you get
A	yeah
B	and write things like that but at the time like you I just thought they were giving us extra work to do which we all enjoyed doing but I guess that was the teacher's way of encouraging yeah but not all of the teachers did that
A	yeah
B	and erm to go to the she's obviously going to the extents exposing them to higher things and why not? once if a child's bright give it teach it
A	well it's like erm she they started doing their Victorian project in no they did native Americans when they went back in September last year and then before Christmas she started this opera thing and because they'd started doing the Victorian project they were all really into the Victorian project because they went to
B	mm
A	and the kids all enjoyed doing it so much she let it carry on
B	oh right
A	because they were so into learning about the Victorians they it's all
A	I haven't seen it no I just thought about that
A	yeah is that alright?
B	oh have you bought have you bought it mum?
A	well I saw one on Facebay which is like Ebay on Facebook
B	oh okay
A	erm because the one she wanted was two hundred pounds in
B	no
A	then the lady was selling
B	oh one of those proper little old traditional
A	yeah like with like little proper yeah
B	yeah is it in the thing?
D	no
A	no I'll have to have a look later then
B	never mind never mind
D	I can't lift it it's too heavy
B	we'll have a look when dad gets back then
A	so
B	oh yeah how much did?
B	that's better
A	yeah
B	oh she'll love that that'll keep her entertained for the next two years
A	but that's what she wanted to that one that's what she wanted since last last year wasn't it?
D	yeah
A	but because she got a tablet
B	oh yeah
A	I said to her you can't have a tablet and
B	the dolls' house
A	and a dolls' house so yeah this one when I saw this one I was like well fifty quid's to
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah that's true that's a nice way of recycling stuff without being too wasteful
A	yeah
D	I forgot what the website was
A	freebies for Kent just search for it on Facebook and then you just join the group because erm I sold a load of girls' toys on there and they made about eighty quid
B	mm
A	yeah so for stuff that they I would've given to the charity shop or whatever beforehand
B	now you can actually
A	yeah and then that's what she's bought her erm monkeys and stuff with over the holidays when we've gone on days out she's spending her own you know that's your money
B	yeah mum
A	so
B	because you're only I said to mum you're only going to buy her stuff anyway so you may as well give it directly to her and then
A	exactly yeah she's old enough now to know that money's
B	responsibility yeah that's a really good idea another good good parenting technique
B	yeah
B	yeah
D	sorry?
B	I'm joking mother it's all your input isn't it? dad was rogue
A	because we always say to her you're just like your auntie
B	yeah bless her
A	ah I don't know about that she'd go half as far as you well not half as far as in distance
A	I'd rather her stay a bit closer than that
B	wait until yeah see wait until she's older I'll be influencing her
A	I could think of I could
B	she could come and live with me wherever I am
A	oh don't tell her that she'll move in tomorrow
B	yeah I know well she can come down to
A	I
B	yeah it's fine we've got our friends coming to stay with us in
A	yeah because you said you won't be able to make
B	yeah yeah yeah from America so that's why we needed a futon because we stayed with them for we stayed with them for nearly six weeks I think in America so they're staying for three weeks so we're going to let them have our bedroom and we'll sleep in the living room because also we want to get up early and use the kitchen and everything for uni and whatnot so erm we needed a futon but that does mean anytime anyone wants to stay with us they can I mean you could come down
A	yeah I don't know train fares
B	oh yeah I suppose when you get a family ah do you even have to pay for
A	I have to pay for
B	oh you do?
A	but then like yesterday if we erm we went down to
B	mm
A	and then
B	oh does she?
A	only costs us like twenty-five pound for me mum
B	woah is that a return or?
A	yeah it's a return as well so it's not really too bad
D	you'd use more than that on petrol if you
A	yep
B	had a car that's good value
A	so yeah it's not too bad
B	is that because of where he is in
A	no that's
B	oh really? yeah it's like a group family
A	yeah? because that's because
B	oh was he?
A	yeah and erm
B	oh what for
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	he said I even had a waiter put a napkin in my lap
A	he felt completely out of place
B	yeah I know I bet he was like alright alright mate
A	although he did manage to get
B	I'm from
A	so erm but yeah he phoned and he got her a postcard and stuff so she's like oh I really want to go up to London now
B	oh what
A	er
B	yeah I
A	but she wants to do that and she wants to do
B	yeah
A	we're not made of money
B	yeah
A	not if you want a blooming birthday party as well
B	all the museums are free aren't they?
A	yeah exactly it's just getting up there really isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I mean I know them cos she doesn't want to do the tube though she's got a real thing about going on the tube
B	oh has she?
A	doesn't want to go underground she can't even go on a lift though
B	actually the underground's really expensive
A	yeah
B	it's much cheaper to
A	but then we don't mind walking anyway so to us it doesn't bother I mean you go up to
B	central central London isn't very big
A	if you go to
B	yeah
A	you could
A	you can get if you get to
B	yeah it's not far from
A	so yeah we don't mind
B	unless you're going out out
A	yeah if you get central
A	but like I said we done to
B	bother us no
A	well I remember when
B	yeah
A	but yeah that was only
A	the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	is it
A	it's just outside well it's
B	oh
A	yeah but then that train charges more doesn't it? which is a bit cheeky
B	but then that yeah and also the location isn't as good as
B	there's no need to get it really
A	yeah I don't think mum realised that
A	yeah exactly
B	trip to the hospital
A	oh really? oh wow yeah yeah because I mean you go past erm
A	because I remember when we went up there they were still building it and we were both all trying to look at the top on the train we were like oh god that is high isn't it?
B	oh on
A	it is extraordinarily high
B	I think maybe I did see it in when I went to
A	what the smog?
B	classic you could tell like it was you get into above England on the plane and it's just cloud as far as you can because you know you fly above the cloud it's just cloud as far as you can see it's like ah just white fluffy cloud and I'm like ah it's cloudy today great
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah because I looked I remember looking it up on maps and we're like we went to
B	mm
A	which doesn't really bother us because you'll see stuff on the way anyway and discover little bits and bobs
B	and then then it'll take the rest of your day to go round those few museums with
A	exactly yeah well then she went up there for
B	they're busy as well in the summer
A	they weren't allowed in the gift shop either so she was most upset she weren't allowed in the gift shop
B	ah yeah I mean
A	I think that's pretty
B	really busy there though
A	yeah
B	it's always
A	and it's so expensive as well I remember we bought we bought food up there last time and it was like six pound for a sandwich
B	oh
A	yeah just a picnic this time we've got a pushchair it's fine it can go on that
B	yeah yeah
A	which is another reason I don't want to do mess around the tube not with the pushchair and
B	oh right
A	if she was a bit older wouldn't bother me so much but yeah
B	ah she doesn't like the lift
A	so there's no way I'm going to get her underground on a tube
B	no wait until she's a bit older
A	yeah
B	as no yeah my friend
A	oh bless her
B	until one night when we were quite drunk and me and
B	it's the only time she went in there but yeah she still doesn't go in there she just doesn't like the idea of the closed space
A	yeah that's what
B	the lift yeah I know it's a pretty foreign entity it's not
A	yeah she doesn't mind the glass like like in the
B	oh she doesn't mind that one?
A	yeah it's not being able to see I think
B	so ah
A	and being that I mean they are quite claustrophobic aren't they? I mean yeah
B	yeah really boxed in
A	yeah pain in the bum so someone has to walk up stairs of course normally I've got a pushchair and I'm like well I can't do that with the pushchair
A	and
B	yeah
A	mm yeah
A	yeah that's what I reckon I reckon she'll probably grow out of it anyway
B	yeah she will she's still young
A	I know you're going to say no but would you like any help?
B	yeah I haven't even offered mum
D	I'm alright
A	I offer her every time
D	I'm okay
B	yeah
A	she's like no
B	she knows how to cook a roast pretty efficiently I reckon
D	I've always been better on my own in the kitchen
B	yeah
B	ah
A	useless
B	he relies on you for all
A	he can make a mean jacket potato
B	oh I mean
A	I often say to him look if I get hit by a bus tomorrow what are you going to do? I'll just buy instant mash
B	ah
A	it's the peeling bit he can't do
B	oh well
A	can't use he can't use
A	I know I when she
B	looks kind of like it should be alive or something
A	well that's exactly what the woman said when we she bought it the woman went should I check it for a pulse?
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	but I thought it was quite funny
B	yeah
A	but it's the one she cos now they're older they're allowed to have their own schoolbags and their own stationery
B	oh yeah oh are they?
A	so of course this year she was like I want my own stuff
B	oh that's the big year when you go stationery shopping used to love going school shopping
A	because uh if you smell her pencil case her pencils are scented
B	oh
A	I know
B	oh yeah these ones
B	oh yeah oh they're all ah they're colouring pencils
A	she thought it was brilliant
B	oh and this this fella's new is he?
A	it's like oh they smell lovely yeah they're new
B	one of them each
A	there
B	she likes going to school then? she doesn't want to miss a day she said
A	no she
B	appointment was
A	and she's like I'm not missing school because she cried last term because she didn't get a hundred percent certificate
B	oh
A	she cried she actually came out of the school in tears
B	ah god
A	because she never got one because she
B	oh she really likes
A	because she'd missed she had two late going ins because of her odd doctor's appointments
B	oh
A	and because of that they wouldn't give her a certificate
B	bless her
A	that was a bit thought it was a bit harsh personally
A	yeah just went in late but because she'd missed the eh because she missed the erm registration it doesn't count
B	that is harsh
D	registration
B	oh is that why she said earlier she doesn't want to miss the register?
A	yeah
B	I thought that was a funny thing to say I was well you can leave after the register does that still count? maybe it does then
B	is the registers all digital now? do you know?
A	no I think
B	paper
A	paper because you still get you know two
B	oh do they?
A	to
B	and then they put it in I suppose
A	yeah I suppose they do
A	yeah that's why she's determined not to
B	well maybe it'll make it for later in the afternoon or something?
A	because that's why I've that's what I
B	anytime after three's alright isn't it?
A	when I queried it at the end of the term they said erm oh well what you should do
B	yeah exactly
A	by her going in at half past nine she's not really missed that much has she? by the time we actually get going in the morning
B	exactly missed a bit of warm-up activity
A	exactly you know they normally do sort of like some it's normally like colouring and stuff like that when they first go in like some worksheets
B	yeah
A	I suppose while teacher's getting set up and whatever
B	yeah
A	so yeah I thought by doing that you're not missing that much but
B	no you're not
A	I'll remember that next time
B	ah bless her
B	yeah yeah hopefully then it'll be
A	yeah
B	that's a pain in the bum then as well
A	well luckily your mum took us last week
B	yeah well
A	so it wasn't too bad
B	someone should erm should coordinate it with her day off in September although we're how far ahead do you know your
A	erm
B	the next
D	yeah
B	yeah I'll have a look at your diary later I know you don't know off the top of your head
D	what
B	I don't know it's just in general I'm just curious what your schedule is like for the month
D	I know next week I'm Wednesday Friday
B	so we can still do a trip Sunday maybe
D	I don't know what I'm doing and one of them is only a short shift but I think it's a late I don't think it's an early
B	so do you still want to go to
A	yeah hoping to
B	was going to ask dad if he wanted to drive don't know if he will though do you reckon dad'll want to go to
D	I don't know I mean perhaps
B	can go off and have a look round some shops or something?
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah because it's quite there's quite a lot to do at
A	it's literally it's like that
B	is it a steep hill then? oh dear
A	it's just this winding zigzag literally I mean we had to pull the kids up they literally couldn't make it on their own
B	ah
A	and I don't think with a pushchair
B	no
A	I would make it this time I mean mum really wanted to go she was trying to talk
B	she's erm she
A	yeah she's off Sunday
D	if we took two cars your mum could still come
A	yeah but that's where were you?
B	and so yeah
D	because for
A	yeah
D	I mean
A	because yeah I said I didn't mind like I mean I said to mum I'd get the train but it is
B	yeah
A	yeah but is that it's a long it is a long walk and I don't think she'd manage I mean walking around in it is tiring enough because I mean the keep's up here the tunnels are down here it's a massive massive site I mean there was two buildings that we couldn't even get into when we went because they were being closed off
A	and they've all been refurbed now they've been redone they've been reopened to the public with new
B	woah
A	looking at everything I mean because there's the church there's the
B	oh yeah
A	because it's all I mean because it's on top of a flipping cliff it's like tunnels are down here but then you've got literally it's like that up to the keep and then you've got to climb the keep afterwards
B	yeah
A	which has got like two hundred steps in it or whatever it was shattering
B	no no well I guess it how much does it cost to get in? do you know the details?
A	no
B	I wonder can you get family coupons and
A	I'm not sure I know they do do
B	yeah okay just
D	I think it's raining
A	oh is it?
D	yeah
B	uh could you bring the erm the bloody?
D	basket
B	no not the basket I'll use my hands ah did you erm?
