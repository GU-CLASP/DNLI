A	back cos they delete the numbers from the presumably because they don't want me to do business with the
B	them directly
A	directly and so they
C	oh the agencies yeah
B	but I don't I don't want to do business with someone
A	no of course not
B	cos then you can't google the firm and say how have their removals been you know get reviews on them or whatever
C	oh no
B	that's no good at all is it? wish bloody Pickford's'd pitch up and tell us what they want to do
C	are you waiting to hear from them?
A	yes
B	they're not in your junk mail?
A	no mm
B	how are your boys then?
A	sounds
B	mm
C	and in India it's a community really it's not a retreat it's quite a long period of time and there's a huge amount of administration that comes with it and then on my side you know all the books and the website and texts and videos and erm all kind of variety of erm of presenting information really and knowledge and so it's a huge thing and a lot of people are involved you know so it's just like
B	mm
C	not democratic what's the word? just shared really
B	mm
C	that needs to be further away from that and that element doesn't work and then you have to make it live so whenever someone's hovering over the page you know with web pages things happen to show you
B	happen
C	that you can click
B	mm
C	for instance if you go over a link usually it changes colour or it bounces or it gets bigger or something erm and whatever things move and are responsive so all of those things
B	mm mm
C	and normally the two of us are trying to do it over Skype you know with erm looking not quite looking at the same thing and all you want to do is sit in front of same screen and go try this try this try this
B	mm and then she can do that
C	so she can do all of that yeah cos they're anyway together
B	mm
C	and she's got a good eye for things and erm
B	yeah ongoing
C	and it's mostly
B	it's really really
C	their permanent job see that's none of our permanent jobs it's like our
B	the lowest on your list
C	always usually cos there are live things happening you know like now we're doing this and you always there's a project going on I have three book four books going on at the moment
B	mm
C	and so we never get round to it and it's a pity because for the majority of people that's exactly where they're going to come in touch with the teaching they're going to go on the website they're going to read that that's going to be their constant contact with it
B	mm
C	so really it should be our priority
B	mm
C	so I'm thinking now that I would like to set her up as kind of the one who would develop it all graphically
B	mm
C	and erm there's another boy
B	mm
C	so when I do design work I quite like good at the think up an idea bit and have you know I can kind of make things looks nice but I don't ever go into the nitty-gritty and if you look at good design it's usually done by someone extremely pedantic cos it's all erm mathematical really so he made for us a big logo of the teaching for the hall erm printed on a kind of a canvas you know which we hang kind of at the
B	mm
C	but he worked on the erm original scan of the logo and just went into detail pixel pixels detail and went sort of smoothed certain things over and chose like slightly different colours for the and it was just lovely yeah so
B	amazing talent
C	yeah he's really good at that he's that nature of person but he could be definitely involved as well
B	end of October last weekend in October
C	so it won't be interfered with by all the moving and stuff? mm
B	and the
C	a real one or just that you're going to be the victory team?
B	a real one oh I don't know
B	but erm yeah I don't know it's a proper
C	no I meant real as in you're actually competing you're not just going to
B	we're competing no no no no we're not just going to show off
C	have a jolly and show off yeah
B	yeah no very exciting
C	mm be a lark well you have to sing and you have to be graded don't you?
B	yeah
C	so it's not without pressure
B	no and that's at like nine o'clock in the morning so that's not jolly either
C	done and dusted oh but yeah
B	erm and then the next morning we it's called sing with the champs erm that's at nine o'clock in the morning as well
C	hate doing things at nine o'clock in the morning anything
B	and erm and then I'll we do our sort of it's kind of terrible slot really they took us out of the show and put us as to sing four songs while people are waiting for the results and frankly they don't give a damn
B	erm yeah yeah I mean they're waiting for the results they don't want to see some other choir singing who aren't even in it
C	they just want to
B	they just want to know
C	they're just distracted
B	but anyway that's what we're doing
C	well it's always good experience to perform the songs cos it's completely different isn't it?
B	oh yes I don't mind at all I you know but that's our our job and then we're on the doors and you know we have other jobs
C	oh no
B	Friday night show
C	and like with your
B	we do yes yes
C	in Christmas and stuff that's nice
B	so erm we've got two in December and er a few coming up
C	mm mm
B	mm
A	probably
C	it's quite weird isn't it? do you feel like you've left already?
B	not quite no
A	not quite
C	mm mm
B	cos our things are all there
C	yeah exactly
B	you know it's still our house
C	well you'll have to say goodbye
B	we haven't heard anything from the little peeps have we? from the estate agent peeps
C	they're a bit rubbish aren't they?
B	well they did post us that other thing
C	mm
C	little
A	yeah
A	when I told our guy it was a Yamaha C5 he said oh that's a whopper isn't it?
A	bit of a beast
C	bit of a beast oh well at least he knew what he was talking about
A	he knew exactly yes
C	that's really reassuring
A	he said that's seven foot long I said oh that's right
C	is it seven foot?
B	see now you're talking to the right person aren't you?
C	I love it
B	they know the piano
C	love it
B	they said they it'd be stored horizontally
C	really? mm much better not like some guy saying
B	oh yeah we have a warehouse
C	we've got a warehouse it's it's roughly the right the same temperature
B	it and we'll wrap it up
C	we'll wrap it up in cellophane
A	yeah I
C	good mm dad was saying erm that he had said to the piano tuner about thinking about downsizing and getting a Steinway
B	yeah
C	and that it was gonna be some ludicrous amount of money just for and upright second second hand
A	yeah
B	that's right
C	didn't realise it was such a leap
B	you couldn't even order one
C	yeah there's like a waiting list of several years
B	mm
C	I don't think I've ever played one or maybe did they have one at school?
B	no
A	this sort of thing really
C	mm
A	so I click on one way hire
C	mm
A	and then it wants me to put in the return
C	destination
A	so why do they?
C	oh the return journey
B	no you have to return it to a depot
C	maybe it just means to where
B	so where's the return place
A	oh you're right
C	oh
A	yeah
B	you wally
C	you wally
A	oh oh
A	that's true
C	mm
A	I was just getting very cross
A	well there's a lot of stuff on our spreadsheet which is labelled
C	clothes
A	like the bunk beds for instance and the
C	cycle bike
A	the hedge trimmer and the crockery and various things which are not going to be stored
C	yeah
A	so they've got to brought down here
C	lamps pictures but you can't fit it all in the car?
B	two
C	no yeah
B	coffee tables
A	okay so I'm picking it up at
C	mm
A	and I'm returning it
C	so you're going to drive up together and then you're going to drive down separately
B	yeah
A	we'll have to yeah
C	mm
A	what is your location where do I return it?
B	well you can put
A	we're going to be in
B	and and see what they offer
C	mm I'm not that optimistic about
B	isn't that in Wales somewhere?
C	it's not exactly on the map of the er usual
A	we've got Perth and Penzance but not
C	mm
B	try
C	mm
A	no I didn't I wouldn't dare
C	good oh dad and I watched the first two episodes while you were out
B	mm
A	you loved it didn't you
C	it was really good yeah
A	so it is October the second isn't it? we're going to do all of the removal and then drive down October the second or are we going to do all the removals stop overnight and drive down on October the third
B	it depends what day they offer us for the removals doesn't it?
A	well this is chicken and egg I'm I'm asking them to give I'm asking them to make it the second
B	what day is the second?
A	the Friday
B	and you'd you'd specially want to be there the whole week? that's
A	I
B	right
A	I mean there's all types of things we have to
B	that's okay okay we'll give ourselves a week that's fine it just erm
C	there's no point in putting a
B	no
C	I mean it's exactly it's not uncomfortable for you to be there
A	no
B	but we need to leave
A	the week after
B	no we need to leave there'll be no furniture in the house
A	well that's my point so but it would be tough for us to have the whole day with the removals people and then drive down
B	no erm I agree so erm it would probably stay in a hotel or something that night
A	right so the third?
C	oh you won't have beds
B	we won't have beds
C	we will we'll have the bunk beds cos we're bringing them here
B	well we could sleep on the bunk beds
B	is we so desire my darling
C	sounds wonderful I'd go for the hotel but I don't know each to their own
C	I know
A	giving you a calendar and you can't click on it
