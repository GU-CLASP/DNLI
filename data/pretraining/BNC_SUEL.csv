A	oh did you see in the Metro
B	oh is there?
A	did you see it?
B	no
A	advertising tickets
B	it's sold out though I thought
A	really?
B	well I mean mine
A	are you going to that? Cos you've got a ticket haven't you
B	yeah
A	is that is it a crunch game or something? Cos West Ham can't
B	well it would've been
A	get automatic
B	I I I think if they probably if they win every game and and Reading and Southampton don't
A	ah
B	it
B	I want them to suffer
A	before they go in
B	yeah
A	my cousin  my cousin  er friend's cousin plays for Reading
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	doesn't he
A	um
B	huh
A	Cos they're gonna
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	they were singing to the the who were they playing? Who were they playing? Birmingham fans
B	two one up against Reading
A	it's pot calling kettle black
B	yeah exactly
A	Cos you oh you went to that game as well?
B	mm
A	oh yeah
B	one nil up
A	mm
B	and then they went two one down in the space of two minutes
A	look how they've advertised it
B	yeah
A	push for a promotion
B	no I mean
A	oh no
B	playoff places
A	the fourth position
B	so they're  so they're  trying to sort of
A	are we
B	they lost last night
A	I always think it's unfair when the teams in the playoffs
B	mm
A	third place team is Wrexham
B	uh-huh
A	and they've got ninety points
B	oh okay
A	first team qualifies automatically
B	mm
A	they've got a hundred and one points
B	right
A	Wrexham was second
B	mhm
A	at ninety points during the play-offs
B	okay
A	and the two teams below them have got seventy-one
B	mm
A	so Wrexham could go into the play-offs with a team that are twenty points behind them
B	and lose
A	ah
B	mm
A	it doesn't seem fair does it
B	not really
A	yeah
B	but then again you know with something someone like West Ham it is
B	because they they've been arseholes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and Crawley have gone playing in the first division now
B	yeah
A	they came up with the gold
B	have they? Crawley?
A	which they're not saying who where it's come from
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	are they not?
A	no
A	three one
A	my friend
A	oh the shame of it  the shame of it
A	Essex isn't it
B	mm
B	mm
A	I think it's just outside Dagenham isn't it?
B	oh
A	probably corrupted
B	mm
A	Brian's tree
B	Brian's tree down in Essex
B	mm
A	you've demolished it haven't you
B	I have
A	I do like this savoury pancake though
B	so where did you have your cake? Your
A	in the cafe downstairs
B	oh I see
A	in the baby
A	when I bought the um chair
A	I thought oh it's half
B	Good on you
A	yeah
A	I don't mind having two two lunches
B	two lunches
A	yeah
A	I if it's savoury it's okay
B	how's the um weight going?
A	the little men?
B	no the weight
A	oh yeah
B	mhm
A	with my dad
B	oh yeah
A	I'm his pacemaker
B	right
A	because he um he only runs faster when he runs with me he says so
B	oh okay
A	I helped him break his record by two and a quarter minutes
B	mm well that's good
A	because he was rushing to catch up with me
A	about seven kilometres
B	mm
A	but we um might be do what they've got these park runs now
A	A lot of um volunteers organize these park runs
B	mm
A	you just turn up on a Saturday at nine o'clock
B	mm
A	barcode
B	mm
A	and they scan it at the finish
B	oh
A	you just have to turn up with little
B	oh brilliant
A	it's just run by volunteers
B	every week or?
A	you could do it every Saturday if you wanted
B	at er different parks
A	yeah
B	you got them in
A	we're gonna find
A	you can lick the plate
A	but um
B	right yeah
B	right
A	mm
B	yum yum yum
A	well that was  that was  quickly eaten
B	yeah
A	mm
A	I really liked that
B	yeah
A	I bet you most if you went round and asked I bet most people here will be teachers
B	yeah
A	or
B	lecturers
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	oh yeah
B	living it up
A	in her gte?
B	yeah
A	you're joking
B	yeah
A	oh no quarantine
B	quarantine
A	really?
B	yeah
A	I'm surprised at that because um coming coming back the other way into Britain
B	so yeah
A	mm
B	that can be picked up
A	oh
B	and as long as you have a certificate you can bring it back
A	oh that's good
B	and bring them back
A	ah
B	Cos there was talk about like pet passports
A	mm
B	that's obviously a bit  a bit  bit silly isn't it
A	imagine trying to tell the difference between tabby cats
A	wah
B	or getting them to take a photograph
B	more than two seconds
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she's over there till I don't know when
A	it's only a two week break isn't it
B	mm
A	oh good yeah
B	yeah
A	yet today and yesterday
B	yeah
A	it should've been raining but
B	no it's been
A	beautiful
B	it's held out hasn't it
A	yeah
B	yeah cos we had quite a lot of rain on Sunday didn't we
A	yeah
B	Monday?
A	the garden needs it though
B	yeah
A	you didn't sit out in your
B	no
A	in the garden
B	no
A	oh yeah
B	and
A	aha
B	well yeah
A	no
B	and sort of like oh I'll just have half an hour here and half an hour there
A	but do you have like a stream of consciousness and then you go back and edit it? Or
B	I
A	do you ever
B	um I'm beginning to start to do that
A	cut and paste and change it?
B	well yeah and I think that's a cos I tend to to sort of sit down and try and do it in my head
A	mm
B	Cos it it
A	yeah
B	it's impossible to say it
A	you need to have more clauses
B	exactly
A	in your writing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	right
A	that's an interesting um
B	it is  it is  Yeah
A	mm
B	as well and
A	mm
B	that you'd never probably
A	and you can focus on your train of thought and so can the reader
B	I
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's different from a spoken
B	yeah
A	lecture isn't it
B	mm
A	or or yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean who isn't interested in how
B	mm
A	doing them a long time
B	mm
A	so they don't need notes anymore
B	yeah yeah
A	do it don't they
B	yeah yeah
A	and
A	Cos you've seen them quite a few years
B	yeah yeah
A	haven't you
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's the same
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	same presentation
B	pretty much the same
A	just add some more up to date anecdotes maybe yeah
B	I suppose
A	that's good
B	yeah I suppose
A	Cos that's your skill
B	yeah
A	and you're ready
B	mm
A	once you can
B	which it's probably not
A	yeah
B	in the world of sociolinguistics
A	no
B	is it
A	they earn their money in the marking probably don't they
B	yeah
A	in the
B	yeah
A	after a while
B	oh yes
A	no
B	right
A	or B doesn't need me anymore
B	mm
A	and is doing well
B	or C
B	they haven't got
A	that's true
A	or D yeah or yeah A or going back to A
A	and she got really poor marks and thought what the hell did I pay that for? No I think it was alright really
B	mm
A	she was a bit all over the not all over the place she had some good ideas but she didn't know how to simply yeah simply structure it
B	and that's funny because she did two courses at BLS
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	bit kind of like say one thing and
A	yeah
B	think another
A	yeah
B	but but but was she
A	not wanting to offend and yeah
B	yeah
A	like taking advice but done something
B	yeah
A	Cos I wonder if she
B	I think she did appreciate you though
A	yeah she did
B	oh okay
A	she said
B	okay
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the whole point of an MA is to explore your analyze
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and like
B	not really
A	but why would it makes you realize doesn't it
B	I suppose
A	we weren't prepared to think outside the box
B	no
A	were we
B	but then I suppose if they come from backgrounds er where education does provide the answers then
A	mm
B	then that's what they
A	well yeah
B	mm
A	Greece is quite
B	I would imagine
A	which is bizarre
B	mm
A	greek philosophy
B	yeah
A	you'd think it would be
B	mm
A	filtered down through education
B	dunno
A	but know
B	no
A	Cos I bumped into her on the bus stop
B	yeah
A	she look she looked really fed up
B	right
A	she said she can't she said everything was dodgy about the schools she said
B	yeah
A	dark moody difficult
B	yeah
A	maybe Serbians are like that
B	yeah that's what I used to quite like about her actually you know
B	she she was very cynical about the language
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	er um mm
B	oh okay
A	schools that do every yeah yeah
B	okay
A	and nothing
B	yeah
A	we do secretarial
A	computer
A	english and physics
B	we can do it
A	oh no
B	yeah
A	it was funny though cos the guy who ran the place
B	uh-huh
A	did
B	yeah
A	business-driven sort of guy
B	they closed down didn't they?
A	well yeah
A	well no he actually he's now a school in er
B	ah
A	so to give him credit they have gone on and made themselves quite a nice little school there
B	okay
A	but the the school they were sharing with was more dodgy
A	which closed and
B	there's always a dodgy git behind it isn't there
A	oh yeah
B	have they?
A	so you so the students can't work twenty hours a week now
B	at all?
A	no
B	mm
A	up until last year
B	higher education
A	not in the language
B	yeah
A	see that's why I think a lot of places got less longer-term people
B	yeah
A	Cos in that school in London
B	mm
A	we had Koreans who came for like a year
B	absolutely
A	now they won't because they can't work
B	that was the thing wasn't it
A	you know have a year work and study
B	mm
A	and tours and
B	yeah
A	thing to to do
B	yeah
A	but that's been closed
B	but then again you know er so many students just came through it to do the work and not the study
A	oh yeah
B	as a way of getting your feet
A	that's true
B	in the country and then disappearing
A	yeah
B	which is mm
A	well yeah
B	mm
A	people abused the system didn't they
B	absolutely
A	yeah
B	were
A	oh yeah
B	school owners particularly
A	mm mm mm mm
B	to be honest with you
A	mm mm mm
B	I wonder so
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	maybe we should go into a school and do some
A	about um oo I've I've forgotten now
B	yeah
A	that didn't last long did it
A	no
B	go
A	but I think I I can't remember if I read the article in The Observer
B	yeah yeah
A	extrovert bias towards extroverts
B	oh right
A	I think it
B	Cos
B	Cos I cos
B	it it would be quite interesting wouldn't it just to to observe you know how teachers respond to
A	mm
B	more vulnerable
B	what? Extrovert in terms of the
A	extrovert in term teachers and the students
B	I
B	no
A	the the the book reviews that we did
B	yeah
A	type activities
B	right
A	whereas the
B	well yeah
A	mm
B	you know again that that students have to be doing stuff
A	right
B	with other students
A	yeah
B	you know the
A	that would be classed as extrovert
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos introvert would be like working alone
B	right
A	book project or
B	yeah
A	um any sort of research
B	no they don't do they
A	it is  it is  biased towards communicative stroke extrovert
B	but then old what did old
A	really?
B	they may as well
A	ah
B	kind of like an attitude that you know when they come to the classroom they should be doing speaking activities
A	do they think that's what they paid for?
B	Cos that's what
A	but to be fair that a lot of students do
B	but have you
A	feel that don't they
B	yes
A	oh right
B	do you get pieces back?
A	oh yeah
B	you know it it just depends what they're there for isn't it
A	it's an exam preparation course
B	well exactly
A	mm
B	is that you know well why are the students here? If they're here to do pieces of academic writing then that's what you wanna be doing in class
A	yeah
B	but um of course
A	well yeah
B	mm
A	no it's true  it's true  Cos yeah generally this is more yeah whimsical isn't it
B	mm
B	mm
A	it is though
B	it is  it is it is  I mean I yeah and and as far as like the
A	yeah
A	mm
B	of people
A	oh no
B	well yeah just beacuse I'm shy and I don't like acting the idiot and clowning around
A	doesn't mean you're gonna be a bad teacher
B	doesn't doesn't mean yeah
A	but no that was definitely I remember quite a few characters in my
B	mm
A	and they were the sorts who could sort of like um who wanted to teach their students Bohemian Rhapsody
B	yeah
A	and all that sort of stuff and
A	who cares?
B	for what purpose?
A	I don't know
A	I mean imagine that
B	no but yes
A	imagine that
A	I mean they must  they must  think it absolutely bonkers wouldn't they
B	and let's concept check Galileo
A	oh God
A	but yeah
B	oh absolutely
A	fun
B	student interaction
B	and at the end of it they were able to sing
A	it's funny you said er to mention Bohemian Rhapsody cos of the
B	did they?
A	yeah
B	bohemian Rhapsody?
A	mm
B	and these were mainly Korean students?
A	on the course
B	who must have really enjoyed that
B	being made told to make a complete tit out of themselves
B	your Mandarin class
A	it would be
B	there was one girl
A	no I want to know how to buy stamps in the post office
B	yeah
A	for example
B	no you're gonna sing Bohemian Rhapsody
B	teacher there
A	oh
B	cos he recorded them doing presentations and put them on YouTube without their permission
A	oh dear
B	they were  really angry about it
A	he should've asked their permission
B	he should have done really
A	it's so public
B	you know
A	but why did he put it on YouTube? It's not
B	I don't know  I don't know  I suppose he was English language teacher and he thought that'd be great
A	probably thought that was the fashionable thing to do and er
B	yeah
A	of course for them that's a very public loss of face
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	be anywhere near that kind of forum
A	how do you put videos on YouTube anyway?
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I wouldn't put pictures of other people's kids up there
B	mm
B	no
A	but it's funny isn't it
B	yeah
A	and we're
B	yeah
A	but yeah
B	absolutely
A	some yeah it's for fun but
B	yeah
A	others it's like why are we doing
B	where do they get that from
A	well
B	thinking it's a
A	to to London
B	right
A	primarily to to London
B	so how is it sold to them? How do they?
A	I don't know
B	to London
B	right
A	they're taking a child to London for three weeks
B	mm
A	the teenagers of course it's more fun to be
B	mm
A	you know on the excursions isn't it
B	yeah
A	but the parents
B	yeah
A	then that that justifies the expense I think
B	do you know how much they pay?
A	or
B	but a lot or?
A	probably a fair amount
B	right
A	plus accommodation
B	okay
A	and travel
B	accommodation in a hostel?
A	host family
B	host family
A	and some of them were really bare minimum
B	that's another scam as well
A	I know
B	A host family
A	it's more like a lodger lodging
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you are part of the family
B	yeah
A	arrangement
B	get bed
A	yeah
A	nice introduction to English culture isn't it
B	yeah
B	and sing Bohemian Rhapsody
A	but it's ah yeah ridiculous
B	yeah
A	er I don't the agents I don't
B	right
A	quite trust you know
B	right
A	you never got a straight answer
B	mm
A	and cor
B	mm
A	and the agents didn't know
B	Cos I I suppose again
A	yeah
B	come to London
A	it's terrible
A	it's terrible
B	I don't know what they wanna learn
A	it was interesting getting an insight in that
B	mm
A	it's like
B	it is
A	oh yeah
B	you know outgoing people
A	activities
B	activity people and
A	that word activity it's so strange isn't it
B	yeah
A	what does it mean? Reading could be an activity
B	I suppose so
A	yeah
B	okay
B	yay
A	I felt like that oftentimes
B	yes
A	kids from the groups
B	which
A	yeah
B	ah
A	it doesn't matter
B	where are you going on holiday this year?
A	mm
B	just there?
A	er nowhere else
B	oh okay
A	yeah um by train
B	by train? Oo expensive
A	um yeah it wasn't too bad actually
B	you booked already?
A	number
B	oh
A	no
B	really? Oo how posh
B	from where?
A	from um
B	Waterloo
A	yeah
B	to Exeter?
A	Exeter Central
B	mhm
A	Cos if you book um quite a lot in advance it should be a lot cheaper
B	mm
A	Cos how do you go down to Devon usually?
B	I haven't been for ages
A	ah
B	yeah
A	you don't get the coach?
B	no because my sister now lives in
A	oh right
B	and it's a real troublesome journey because you have to go to
A	mm
B	it takes like six or seven hours so
A	that's the problem with
B	no
A	or buses
B	no
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	it's tough isn't it really
A	get away from
B	away from
A	oh right
B	so I haven't got to think about
A	you went to Turkey though didn't you
B	I did go to Turkey yeah
A	how did you like it?
B	I didn't really
B	like it
A	oh
A	why?
B	well because one
A	mm
B	we went
A	mm
B	but because it was a tourist part of Istanbul
A	Istanbul wasn't it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and because it was
A	very touristy
B	very touristy
A	mm
B	they were celebrating Christmas more than we celebrate it here
A	really? mm
B	so all the shops had happy Christmas sprayed on it and
B	you go into a bar
A	mm
B	so I don't like that
B	and then and so in the
A	too commercialized
B	too commercialized
A	mm
B	because you walk down the street and they everybody wants to sell you something
A	mm
B	oh buy a carpet
B	give you a tour up the Bosphorus
A	did you go to the um well my last boss went to  went to  Turkey a lot
B	mhm
A	he went to the coast
B	okay
A	where there are lots of Roman ruins
B	ah
A	it's quite nice and quiet on the coast there
B	yeah
A	yeah he avoided Istanbul
B	yeah I think I I would advise anybody to
A	nice to visit there but probably off season
B	off season
A	mm
B	because er they would take you to the  to the  sort of the important landmarks
A	oh yeah
B	and you would
A	yeah
B	well I don't
A	yeah
B	it's probably best to go in a  in a  tour group
A	yeah
B	because someone
A	mm
B	they don't have that same kind of window shopping
A	yeah
B	culture that we have here
A	and you're obviously tourists so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think that happens anywhere now
B	mm
A	Cos most
B	true
A	quite commercial I think
B	yeah
A	I can't remember
B	mm
A	opposite Cyprus
B	oh
A	that way
B	I've heard of Antalya
A	yeah
B	seems to be where a lot of people go
A	somewhere yeah
B	right
B	mm
A	but I've never been
B	really?
A	apart from nowhere
B	I've never been to the Mediterranean
A	any country
B	yeah but
A	Mediterranean
B	I've never really gone to the sea
A	oh right
B	I'm not a sea sort of I don't know
A	mm
B	get too restless
B	mm
A	should be enough
