A	so the the pie had um quite a lot of spices in it
B	mhm
A	uh flavours like the uh garlic the carrot onion like the flavours had some extract in them
B	tasted quite peppery
A	yeah they it had like black pepper extract
B	yeah
A	and yeast extract went in there
B	yeah

B	or you not planning on spending? Yeah
A	yeah
B	should
A	oh yeah yeah
B	with seventy candles
A	um yeah
B	well I can just get one of those number sevens cos I've got a number zero from when you were thirty
B	you know? That's in there somewhere I'm sure I saw it the other day
A	it sounds sounds like a great idea
B	ah she'd like that wouldn't she? She like a bit fuss
A	something um
B	doesn't
A	I think so I mean
B	or would she be embarrassed?
A	well
B	what's that for?
A	I was gonna grill this
B	ah put it in the grill pan
A	oh the the the um
A	uh yeah so I dunno if um what she'd want but I thought it would be
B	she normally asks for some socks from Marks and Spencer's
A	yeah she does
B	I feel like we should probably buy something slightly better if it's like her seventieth
A	well I think that
B	I know she's a woman of simple means
A	in the um in traditionally um I've asked her and she's not asked for like spectacular things so um that's why you know
B	well that's why I was thinking maybe don't ask her and just buy her
A	you know she's she wouldn't be expecting
B	but then again she might not like it
A	um yeah I wouldn't uh I would definitely wanna ask her first uh to make sure cos otherwise it you know could get could make her really
B	well she's funny cos she doesn't really like the sort of things that I would like
A	yeah
B	why what?
A	just have to sort of
B	ask her?
A	wouldn't wanna surprise her cos we don't really like the same things she does
B	like
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't really know what to buy
A	yeah
B	your mam
A	stuff like stuff from from Boot's
B	vanity items
