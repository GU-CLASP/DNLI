B	hello
A	right
A	yeah
B	I've got absolutely nothing to tell you
A	I kind of have in a way I suppose I've been erm today sorting out more stuff
B	mm
A	ahead of I'll put that there ahead of erm moving back and erm I dunno I hit a bit of a brick wall really
B	ah
B	I might have a look at the soups
A	okay
A	yeah I went er
B	I build you up and knock you down
A	I know yeah I went to look for this erm this duvet
B	uhu
A	which I found and then started clearing out that cupboard
B	uhu
A	and I'm not really ready to do that room yet
B	yeah
A	and that room kind of led onto my bedroom and that led on again to the office and then erm the towel rail fell off in the bathroom so I went downstairs and got a screwdriver to fix that and that led to a bit of sorting out in the cupboard with the screwdriver
B	uhu
B	mm
A	and then starting in a bit of a room
B	yeah and
A	and sort that bit and then next wall in the room
A	and then do that bit
B	yeah
A	so yeah so it wasn't really happening
B	you just sort of overwhelmed yourself
A	yeah so I had a lie down on the sofa
B	good for you
A	and listened to
A	some of erm Terry Wogan's Janet and John CD
B	oh nice
A	which was very smutty but nowhere near as smutty as My Dad Wrote A Porno which was hilarious
B	what did you think? did you enjoy it?
A	I loved it
B	it's really funny isn't it?
A	yeah er
B	I was listening I started listening to it again in the gym
A	yeah
B	and this morning I was just like
B	on the machines I was just like you know kind of
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	I think kind of poking fun at it cos it is hilarious just kind of makes up for it and I particularly like the bit where the woman Alice just said stop stop stop stop stop right he pulled her cervix
A	let me just correct you guys
B	yeah three-inch rivets or something
B	ah
A	ah dear
B	really good
A	yeah so
B	but I can't remember
A	stained black thong
B	it's like
B	where is this
A	oh dear
B	erotic part of that sentence? cos it's lost on me
A	oh dear
B	yeah
A	some of it reminded me a bit was erm when the internet started getting erm quite popular when would that've been? er mid-nineties maybe? when the internet started getting a bit more
B	uhu
A	accessible erm actually probably late nineties erm
B	yep I remember the days
A	and erm yeah chat rooms started getting going
B	uhu
A	and I used to go in the Freeserve gay chatroom and chat with all these lovely ladies all over the country and you could usually tell when there was a guy in there pretending to be a lesbian because
B	mm
A	er
A	so I scrambled to pick the lamp up from the floor
A	and we'd just be doing this dialogue
A	so I'd be doing all of this dialogue online knowing that I'm chatting to this guy and sort of imagining him with his dick in his hand
A	get something going
A	and just laughing a lot
B	ah
B	you
A	ah
B	you need to watch Closer this film that I told you about before
A	yeah
B	cos there's a sort of sex erm
A	yeah
B	online on in that and it's it's not
A	okay
B	trying to sort of chat up another man to sort of snare him er in this strange trap er and you know he's like
B	typing the most inane bollocks
B	and this man the
B	er
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	of a sort of elderly or older gentleman
B	mm
A	you know overweight sat in his string vest with
B	yeah
A	that sort of thing but yeah
A	ah well so yes that's kind of what that erm My Dad Wrote A Porno reminded me of

A	good
B	weather was great
A	yeah wasn't it?
B	so I went for a lovely walk
A	mm
B	about half eight went up the hill and back
A	to
B	yeah
A	yeah that's nice
B	it's just nice and I was listening to to
A	mm
A	oh did you?

A	oh up at the hill?
B	yeah
A	ah that's really sweet swings are good
B	yeah although it was
B	yeah I just had a lovely time
A	good
B	er went to
A	yeah that's bad yeah
B	sad day
A	I checked the
B	yeah and there is another one near me that's bigger than that one
A	mm
B	erm then
A	mm
B	put it in plastic wallets
A	that's helpful though
B	erm and then I was like
A	mm
B	you know what I need? I need to go and buy a new notepad
A	yay
B	I was like ah so that means I'll have to go to the shopping centre
A	yeah cos everything else is closed on a Saturday afternoon
B	erm so yeah so I walked
A	mm
B	to the shopping centre and back
A	where'd you go?
B	I well I nipped in I nipped in
A	mm
B	but they didn't have what I wanted so
A	yeah
B	I went to
A	mm that's cool
B	went in a few shops just did a little bit of a pottering
A	mm
A	ah
B	erm and then last night I just don't know did a load of Spanish dicked around a bit
A	mm what did you watch?
B	called Room based on a book by Emma Donoghue
A	oh yes I know her ex-girlfriend anyway yeah
B	oh that's nice yes
A	yeah
B	er Irish Canadian
A	mm
B	possibly and it's about a it's from the perspective of a five-year-old boy who lives with his mum in a room
A	mm
B	and that's all he knows the things in the room he's never been outside of the room
A	wow
B	erm
A	no TV multimedia blah blah blah?
B	there's a
A	okay
B	erm and he has no sort of erm comprehension of the world outside the room
A	mm
B	he's thinks you know there is the room and then there is the TV
A	mm
B	and the TV is make believe and all of the people in the TV are make believe
A	wow
B	and this man who comes every week is real
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	and
A	okay
B	she's been in the room for seven years
A	so she's oh okay right
B	erm so yes I think the point of it is that she's sort of waiting until the boy's old enough to come up with some
A	mm
B	way they can escape or get out
A	blimey
B	erm
A	how very grim
B	it's
A	mm
B	so the language is you know
A	mm
B	it's just too much for me to read erm so yeah the film's
A	mm
B	but I'd recommend it yeah it was quite difficult but
A	why do you feel so determined when you find it so difficult?
B	what? to continue?
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
B	er and I kind of really
A	yeah
B	erm
B	I really want to know what happens
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I am a perseverer in general er
A	I'm generally not
B	oh fuck it
B	can't be arsed
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	yeah I'm more fuck it move on type of person
B	yeah
A	but
B	I don't know where it comes from or where it er sort of stemmed from
A	yeah
B	but yeah for sure
A	mm yeah I think films and books in particular
B	yeah
A	not all of the time sometimes I torture myself to the end but
B	not all of the time do I persevere sometimes I just go this is fucking rubbish
A	yeah
B	erm but I'm not really sure what the
B	oh
B	that's nice
B	erm yeah so it's not sort of every book and there are loads that I've abandoned
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	that was my day
A	good very nice
B	uhu
A	erm and got home about half eight at night something like that so it was
B	uhu
A	out for the day which was really nice erm yeah I was seeing
B	mm
A	cos I think I arrived in Poland on the Sunday and the house wasn't ready till the Monday
B	uhu
A	I couldn't get keys till the Monday so I stayed with her on the Sunday night and that's so sweet her mum is a phenomenal cook
B	uhu
A	she's amazing
B	oh
A	and you know I'd said to
B	oh
A	and I can't even remember what she did now there was a kind of ratatouille type thing which was nothing like a ratatouille I've ever tasted it was delicious and she did some other sort of couscous type dish and the herbs were amazing so yeah I completely appreciated that
B	that's so nice
A	and that
B	uhu
A	and had been laid up in Berlin for a few days with the runs and just feeling really shit and I didn't wanna eat and I didn't wanna drink
B	yeah
A	erm but the smell of this food I just couldn't not and it was delicious and then the next morning my runs started again so
B	oh no
A	yeah how delightful for people transcribing it's like well
A	yeah well that's true it's probably not erm yeah so I was very grateful for that and I met her two cats who are lovely and so it was nice to catch up with her yesterday
B	that's nice
A	pictures of her cats and how they've grown
B	that's nice that's
A	which is lovely erm
B	yeah
A	so yeah well good on them erm
B	mm
A	erm yeah
B	yeah
A	like the vibe round the Dolomites it's nice
B	nice
A	yeah and
B	yeah
A	done a lot yeah we sort of wandered round a little bit went for a walk it was incredibly windy in Krakow which was a new experience for me erm but the net effect was that cos you know Krakow is in a bit of a dip
B	mm
A	and it's really polluted erm the wind just scooted all of the pollution out of Krakow
A	yeah it's really fresh
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it was really nice
B	it did go really windy here in the afternoon but during the day was just excellent
A	stunning yeah
B	really nice
A	mm
A	yeah
B	well kind of cos cos you
A	yeah
B	and I was sort of you know I just felt guilty that I wasn't but
A	mm
B	I thought well it's too cold to you know really do anything
A	yeah
B	and there's nothing that I need to do you know
A	yeah
B	I made these not I didn't make excuses to walk to the shopping centre
A	mm
B	and go for a walk in the morning but you know short of just sitting outside what
A	yeah
B	I don't need to do anything it'd be more effective use of time inside
A	mm
B	ready for summer
A	yeah I suppose after so much snow ice cold
B	oh god I know
A	and very large minus numbers it's erm yeah yesterday was phenomenally warm it was like ten at times
B	mm
A	erm
B	uhu
A	because all of the snow's melted and it's
B	well yeah the snow's melted
A	gone muddy
B	and that was
A	ah
B	no it was really raining
A	yeah
B	yeah erm
A	and got up about half seven
B	cos I was in the gym and it started raining and then it just was like a blizzard
A	yeah
A	that I found so weird
B	yeah
A	yeah looking out at the brown landscape
A	yeah
B	since it began
A	yeah and another little blizzard on my walk here today it's very strange
B	I missed that I don't know what I was doing
A	you might not've had it I suppose
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	so
A	so school tomorrow
A	what time?
B	not till half three
A	oh that's alright mm
B	yeah but Monday's a bit of a ball ache cos I've got these you know it's solid half three half eight
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I need to
A	mm
B	that's like the week cracked
A	excellent
B	and then I've only got to plan the court class and
A	mm
B	one to ones
A	for the rest of the week?
B	yeah
A	yeah? oh happy days
B	it's like it's like kind of like your syllabus in a way
A	yeah
B	or your timetable where
A	yeah
A	yeah I had yeah I used to do eight point three three hours on a Monday
B	yeah
A	and spend most of Tuesday crying
A	curled in foetal position oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I always have huge
A	mm yeah
B	and I'll be a lot better tomorrow if I know or I'll be a lot better tonight if I know
A	mm
B	that I've done these two lessons and then I don't have to worry
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	I don't think through sort of school but
A	mm
B	probably when I started
A	yeah
B	which I found really weird cos
A	yeah
B	whereas
B	er but yeah
A	mm
B	and then especially sort of teaching and especially after holidays like I said
A	yeah
B	erm don't know don't know why
A	isn't it weird how really time is just time but days feel different? and they do
B	yeah
A	you know and hours feel different yeah I find even though
B	yeah
A	it's almost like collecting or connecting into the collective consciousness
B	uhu
A	of
B	mm
A	well humanity or the developed western world or
B	yeah you don't have a sort of
A	yeah
B	so why would you?
A	yeah
B	the only times that I
A	mm
B	where I have Fridays off
A	yeah
B	and you know there's no concept of what day is it? or when's the weekend? or I'm looking forward to
A	mm
B	cos it just doesn't exist
A	yeah yeah
B	er and you're on a completely different time frame er you know and I sort of texted my friend and
B	it's like well
A	oh so it is yeah
B	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and especially over Christmas
A	yeah
A	I was just thinking of Christmas yeah
B	no idea what's going on at all
A	mm
B	Christmas and New Year
A	do you think that's because you're in a different country? different environment
B	yeah yeah and we didn't do an awful lot
A	mm
B	erm I didn't do an awful lot anyway erm and it was just sort of like Groundhog Day
A	yeah
B	like me and my dad going what shall we do today? it's like mm
B	sit on the TV and eat cheese and watch nothing on TV oh okay
B	we'll do that
A	there goes another day
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but it just seemed to go on for ages
A	mm
B	so yes
A	I like when time is like that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	time's like that you know not
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it doesn't matter
A	yeah
A	yeah?
B	ex people not exes necessarily but sort of you know
B	er
A	it's Friday night
A	and I'm not
B	every night's the sort of same at the moment er which I'm quite enjoying
A	yeah
B	really pissed
A	yeah
B	I thought it was funny
A	I don't have so much of that I suppose cos people my age are usually married with children and doing sensible things
B	mm
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you can tell
A	I really don't know that many people that
B	uhu
A	go out and get pissed on a Friday Saturday night anymore
B	I got a text off someone who I'd not spoken to for a couple of years and then
A	ah that's why you were texting me
B	that's why you've appeared out of
A	mm
B	out of the woodwork
A	that explains it
B	what? I was like well I'm so sorry
A	I had a message today from an ex friend
B	uhu
A	erm and a little bit into the year twenty-fourteen
B	uhu
A	come and stay with me or I don't want you to visit me or you know
B	mm
A	go to other bits of Australia it's a large country
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	as a a show of his
B	yeah
A	affection to let him know that
B	uhu
A	let's put it that way so I'm thinking you know big bouquet
B	yeah bit of effort mm
A	twenty thirty quid something like that so got some details ironed out and then I thought hang on a minute with Interflora I think you can order Interflora online from any country
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's the same price so I said well why don't you do that or at least check it out
B	then you can pick them
A	and then you can pick them make sure you get exactly what you want cos you're a gay man and whatever I pick is never gonna be right
A	erm and he he wrote back and er it turned into being all about money all of a sudden which hadn't even crossed my mind
B	oh my god
A	like what?
B	what a drama queen
A	so this is all on Whatsapp erm or Viber or whatever
B	uhu
A	free free messaging erm
B	uhu
A	what planet are you on? what are you on about? when did this become about money? this is about you getting to choose the bouquet
B	yeah
A	that you would like to your specifications
B	uhu
A	and you know I didn't gather that from the conversation that we'd had so anyway he fell out with me erm and he's been known to do that with other friends and family members
B	mm
A	throughout his life and I kind of in a way always wondered when it would be my turn because you know as as friends go I observed how he was not so consistent with other people
B	mm mm
A	and surprised in a way that he had been consistent with me over more than a decade erm so I'm not quite sure
B	mm
A	erm but yes anyway so that was that for the friendship and then months and months and months passed and I got a drunken barrage of texts after that I'm really sorry can you ever forgive me? and blah blah blah so I said of course you know it's no problem you're a bit of a twat but I still love you erm and then that was the end of that didn't hear from him for months and then got a message today sorry to hear Terry Wogan's died I thought of you kiss kiss kiss like nothing's happened
A	I know
A	well you know I
B	yeah
A	did like Terry Wogan of course but yeah I just thought that's a little bit on the random side so
B	uhu that is random
B	people who I've fallen out with and there's only one person that I can think of sort of relatively recently I don't fall out I just sort of
A	yeah
B	stop talking to people
A	mm
B	not because of a reason just because that's how
A	yeah
B	life and friendships work and develop and relationships
A	you drift in you drift out
B	yeah yeah yeah sure er but there was er one of my friends he was my boss er when I worked in one of my many retail jobs er we've known each other for years and we got on well
A	mm
B	and I was like oh I should go but you know it was a fancy dress party which I'm sort of fundamentally against anyway because it requires more effort than is
B	really necessary
A	I agree
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah
B	I know it's sort of
A	and people often spend a lot of money on these things
B	yeah but why would I wanna spend
A	mm
B	I don't have the sort of it's not that I
A	mm mm
B	I'm not a Blue Peter presenter I don't give a fuck erm and I just thought oh you know what? I can't even be bothered and I'd have to sort of go on public transport
A	yeah
B	and I just think this is a waste of my life er
A	mm
B	erm you know he
A	what?
B	and there were like people uploading pictures of the party and there were like five people you know I
A	mm
B	a difficult party
A	yeah yeah so was it his it was his party?
B	yeah
A	that he was organising
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so he maybe didn't have any concept of it being a difficult thing
B	yeah
A	for a lot of people particularly those that had to travel by public transport
B	you know and
A	yeah
B	it took ages for me to go I'm really sorry I didn't come to your party blah blah blah and he was like it was so shit no one came and I was like well
A	mm
B	oh that's awkward but
A	mm
B	never organise fancy dress
A	yeah
B	or you know
A	and you can't make it up?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	we've met up since then but you know we've sort of fallen out of touch again
A	mm
B	er but at least it's on good grounds
A	yeah
B	as far as I know
A	kind of how it is with me and
B	yeah
A	but I feel like something's been lost
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that probably won't be recaptured I sort of feel a
B	yeah exactly
A	betrayal in a lot of ways
B	uhu
A	but it seemed quite illogical and irrational to me when he said oh you're not my friend
B	mm
A	all over the flower incident
B	yeah but er
A	yeah
B	didn't talk to them
A	wow
B	I managed to survive
A	that's funny
B	I think it's the sort of point of this is that
A	mm yeah
B	don't have parties where you have to for example pay a deposit for the venue
A	mm
B	have a party in a pub where you don't have to pay any money
A	yeah
B	you just go to the pub
A	and the pub is glad of the custom
B	yeah and everyone's a winner
A	mm
B	er but don't put any you know it's not necessarily about money but don't put any effort er don't put any money into something where there is absolutely no guarantee that people will attend
A	yeah
B	people saying yes I'll come
A	yeah
B	isn't the same as them actually coming on the day
A	yeah so he'd paid for a venue as well? oh goodness
B	so I think that's another reason why
A	yeah
B	he was really pissed off which you know it's every he's got every right to
A	had he forked out for a buffet or booze and stuff like that?
B	I think yes I think his like mum had done a buffet or something
A	ah
B	I know it's really sad but
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and then the friends would've been sufficiently invested A to come and B to make sure a few of their friends also came
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yes
A	oh well
B	but I mean I'm really against
B	but I am I've never had a party the closest I came to a party was when I was twenty-one
A	mm
B	and we went to the races
A	yeah
B	yeah bet some money on some dogs and then that was it we went home
A	oh I've only held one I mean you know I've had dinner parties and stuff
B	yeah
A	people in Northern Ireland don't really do dinner parties so I
B	but I'd never like hire a venue I mean
A	no I've done that once that was erm cos me and
B	mm
A	and erm
B	mm
A	and who at one point in her life had told
B	mm
A	I think that was at the point where she'd been with
B	mm
A	and the beautiful wedding blah blah blah
B	mm
A	and then
B	uhu okay
A	and
B	uhu
A	she should've got the hell out of there sooner but I don't think her parents or her friends really liked
B	mm
A	approving so we just didn't tell anyone
B	mm
A	then we realised we needed a couple of witnesses erm so we asked
B	nice
A	who were two of my G six girls erm they're great and so they came along as witnesses there were just the four of us that knew so
B	nice
A	we ran off and did it on a Friday afternoon in
B	mm
A	had a fair idea that
B	mm
A	erm so we wanted to make sure we had that paperwork in place erm
B	mm
A	because we'd sort of thought it was a tick box exercise
B	yeah just doing it sort of mm
A	but it became more than that and then we thought well hang on a minute you know we really need to be having a bit of a celebration and I and you know invite our friends over at least whether our families choose to come
B	mm
A	or are able to come or not
B	mm
A	so we actually had our a party erm we got married in July twenty eleven
B	mm
A	had the party in May twenty twelve gave everybody enough notice there's
B	ah
A	and
B	oh nice mm
A	and saying how they were really happy that
A	to get back to
B	to get to the party
A	that's the one and only time I've hired a venue erm we had local diddley-eye musicians from the local pub
B	mm
A	played for us we slipped them a few quid we had a dead pig on a spit thing
B	mm
A	erm
B	love a pig
A	yeah erm yeah lots of veggie options for us veggies erm actually I think we had two caterers the pig was one lot and then we had sort of buffet things as well
B	mm
B	yes dream job dream job
A	oh my god he was all erm
B	shit northern DJ
A	yeah he was really shit
