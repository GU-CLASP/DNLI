A	I haven't put
B	people use this little gadget all day hours of the day do they?
A	I know
B	oh night time yes
A	well they might be on a laptop or even their phone cos it'll work on everything
A	yeah
B	young
A	yes they're very good actually
B	yeah
A	ah right
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	I suppose a lot of people don't know
B	yeah
A	I just learnt myself grandma was good wasn't she?
B	yeah yes yes
A	okay I think that's everything
B	oh yes oh
A	yeah
B	you'll manage to sleep well?
A	yeah I do normally sleep well actually yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	have you managed to clinch the deal on there?
A	no they'll probably get back to me tomorrow now
B	oh I see yeah
A	cos I did put the price up
B	yeah
A	so erm
B	oh yeah another look around yeah
A	I'm not sure I really want people in that long you see when I don't know them
B	no no
A	so
A	and I've got two people now who I know are interested in a longer stay
B	oh well hope for best
A	I'll get people anyway
B	er who are they? mostly students or something or?
A	no mostly professionals I get the odd student but that's more unusual
A	yes
B	professionals don't mind paying a bit extra cos somebody else is paying
A	I think that's it yeah
A	they only mind if they're keeping two places going
B	oh I see
A	and they're paying down here in
B	yeah
A	then they mind
B	yeah
A	and that's when they ask for the discounts
B	yeah
A	but if they're not then they generally don't care
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yes and in that sense those people don't mind when you put your prices up
B	yeah
A	cos they're probably given a cap by their company
B	cos they've all got cars I imagine when they arrive have they?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes no one's come without a car
B	yeah so easy then from your house into the middle of

A	yes
B	so when you have meals do you all have meals together? or
A	no
B	let them have their meal then you'll eat later
A	yes they I don't provide an evening meal
A	they do that but they can use the kitchen if they want
B	yeah
A	although hardly anybody does you know they all buy takeaway and
B	takeaways yeah
A	sort of from the supermarket usually
A	only had one person who's ever cooked and that was a pizza in the oven
B	oh

A	loaf of bread
A	oh yes I don't like them at all
B	no I never eat them I don't eat them no
A	no I don't get it
B	you
A	that's what I feel about them
B	yeah
A	especially the cheaper ones they're awful
A	that's right yeah I feel like that about them
A	I feel they're a bit overrated
B	yeah I think
A	glorified cheese on toast
B	yeah yeah that's right yeah
A	bit of tomato
B	that's a marvellous
A	yes it is good

A	no
B	oh it's over there is it?
A	there's a big one and then a smaller one so if you wanted to they'd fit under each other
B	oh that's it
