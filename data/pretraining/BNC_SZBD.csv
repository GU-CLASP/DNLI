B	oh yes I've heard of that one
A	er what
C	ah how lovely
A	erm and these books sell for about eighty pounds a shot cos they're going to university libraries or some specific departments things like Islamic family law women's legal position in China it's all very very specific and specialised erm so what she does obviously is sort of it's not to do with the content but it's to do with making sure it's all done properly
C	mm
A	and properly edited and everybody does their bit at the right time and all so she
C	yeah
A	so er yeah
B	what what degree did she do?
A	English
B	mm
A	and then she did an MA in publishing
B	oh right
A	well that's it she I mean she's only twenty-four now
B	oh right of course
A	so erm
B	so she's a baby isn't she really?
A	mm
B	compared to
A	erm so she got she went straight from her MA in fact she before she finished it she started this job she started it in June last year and she still had a dissertation to do as well but it was it was a maternity leave she was doing and erm it's one of those sort of double edged things because it got to the point of April this year when this woman who she was replacing would have to decide whether to come back or not and erm the baby was very sick and she decided not to so somebody else's misfortune really that
C	yeah I know that's a that's a really difficult one is
A	it is yeah erm so yeah but once she was permanent and full time they could start looking for a house and sort themselves out and
C	what does
A	something in computers
C	oh right
A	I don't know what
A	send him an
C	oh right okay
A	he he's got that to my computer so
B	has he? so what's he comes in like when you've got problems? and he
C	oh how useful that is
A	yes he just takes it over
B	oh you lucky thing
A	types things in and sorts me out
C	oh that's great I know it's fantastic at work when I had that happen and you ring up the ring up business systems and this has gone wrong okay you know and they eventually eventually ring you back and it's suddenly somebody else and it's a really odd feeling somebody else
A	yes yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	so
B	and you wonder what you've got on your desktop
A	mm
C	mm
B	that they're looking at
A	but then of course it's always something very simple and you know
C	is
A	no
C	isn't he?
C	ah
B	really?
C	that that's not saying very much
B	but what was his erm profession? was he not in IT?
A	no no no
B	oh
A	he started life as a chemical engineer and went into
C	oh I don't think I ever knew that
A	yeah
C	oh
A	he worked at
C	oh right
A	which is how we came down here
C	mm
A	erm and then he went to into management consultancy which is where he stayed really he's done specialised in total quality management which is
B	so was that his his own company?
A	yes erm for well in jointly with
C	oh it's a huge consultancy
A	and erm four or five of them broke away and set up their own company which eventually they've sort of backed out of and passed onto other people so he he's just been an employee for the last few years
C	so did he sell it on? or
A	sort of er it all got very complicated
C	oh
A	erm cos there wasn't really much to sell
C	no but the
A	other than than the name and so on
C	yeah well that's worth quite a lot though isn't it?
A	yeah so they yes they sold their shares in it and their good will and so on he's carried on working for them
B	do you want some more
C	no thank you
A	so there's there's only one of the original five who still well two counting
C	yeah
A	he's almost packed up so
C	he just does a bit as it comes in or
A	yeah he's done thank you erm he's done three or four days a month on average well that's what it works out at
C	no honestly I'm fine thank you
B	tea coffee
C	no no no I'm fine I don't want anything else than you
B	soft drink
C	no
C	honestly I'm fine
A	no since since new year he's he's stuck to what he said really
C	he has
A	bits and pieces he's in South Africa all week at the moment he's only really doing things that he fancies doing or for companies that he likes and er
C	I was gonna say
A	and a week in
C	I thought you'd been on quite a few holidays
A	so yeah
B	mm when you arrived
A	mm
B	and we've been to Thailand we've been to Vietnam then we've gone to New Zealand
A	New Zealand
B	so where's after New Zealand?
A	and erm
C	so exactly is what I mean she'd been to loads of places
A	no this this is where we're going this is
C	oh this is where you're going?
A	this is the big trip
C	oh the big trip
C	no no you hadn't booked it
A	we have booked it we have
C	oh you have booked it?
C	wow
A	seven and a half weeks
C	seven and a half weeks
A	so mm
C	how wonderful I hope to do that one day
A	so I've already stipulated to the kids that I want one of them home each weekend
C	yeah
A	erm yeah haven't booked any accommodation or anything else yet but we've got the flights sorted
C	so you haven't is it an agent you got an agent to do that or have you done it yourselves?
A	yeah oh that's really annoying cos my friend
C	oh
A	and her daughter's in New in Australia so she'd been going pretty well every year she goes off to Australia and she kept extolling the virtues of Trailfinders in
C	yes I've used them they were pretty good they were pretty good but I haven't used them for ages
A	and I sort of said said mm yeah ah we'll do it ourselves we'll sort ourselves out and we we looked and we we did look at erm I mean
C	well ah that's amazing isn't it?
A	erm but erm yeah they sorted it all out and
C	yeah
A	took us through everything we wanted to do and
C	it's quite good to do it that way
A	mm
C	and we flew in we wanted to fly in to Halifax in
A	mm
C	where we were gonna go each day that actually it became a little bit stressful after a while
A	mm
C	fine thinking by about two o'clock in the afternoon you really really had to start concentrating about where you're gonna sleep that night and it ends up being a little bit stressful of oh will we get somewhere? and then you know you happen to think oh we we'll stay in this place this night and then you start ringing round or stop at an internet caf√© and then look and and realise how much time you are wasting
A	mm
C	and then you are making lots of phone calls and you'd perhaps there was something going on in that town and you couldn't actually get in and oh god so in the end I said to
A	mm
C	who obviously had been in that area and she was able to work out well you know this'd be quite good if and you'd need two days
A	mm
C	three-hour ferry rides across from St Lawrence and across the Bay of Fundy which were really long ferry rides and the accommodation in the cities that we stayed in
A	mm
C	but then they came up with the accommodation in various other places that we were going to and and
C	so the Quality Inn in Tadoussac was not somewhere we wanted to stay because we just knew how awful it was gonna be so we then decided that we were gonna we booked our own B and Bs
A	mm
C	and had some fantastic places
A	mm
C	so it worked really well so yeah hello
E	hi
A	hi
C	how are you? oh look at those knees
E	is it still going?
B	yeah it's still recording
C	still recording
E	I would kiss you but
C	no you've
E	not recommended
E	okay I'll leave you to it
B	how many how many were playing?
E	er we got roped in other people so we had four most of the time
B	oh good
E	yeah okay so you've got
C	yep
E	sort of
E	right see you later
C	see you later
C	so erm I I found them really good and I that worked really really well so in the big cities I found that they were you weren't gonna get a sort of different accommodation
unknown_female	yeah
C	but so
A	I had a little bit of a look at erm
C	yes that's be
A	be spoilt rotten on the first little bit
C	oh I'm investigating cos this year we always we always promise ourselves to have a big holiday every other year while we can and so next year's our big holiday so time to book it now Vietnam is on one of the things on my list what made you decide you wanted to go to Vietnam?
A	well I mean from time to time I've heard people say you know it's one of the new upcoming places lots of people going to and it's very nice and
C	oh did she?
A	from Australia
C	yeah
A	and really liked it er but as much as anything when you're looking getting from here to New Zealand well we've been to Hong Kong we've been to Singapore
C	mm
A	erm we've sort of done the big the main places the most obvious places that you probably would stop at
C	lovely
A	and there we go we're in Vietnam over tet which is the Vietnamese new year
C	oh are you?
A	which is one of those double edged things so it'll be really good to see all the festivals and so on but the transport'll be awful and the service in the hotels'll be awful
C	yeah
A	so
C	of course you will
A	mm
B	I've got a good Vietnamese phrasebook
A	oh could
B	I got quite good
C	have you have you been there?
B	no I was teaching a whole load of Vietnamese in prison men and women over the years so I and they knew virtually no English
C	mm
B	so I resorted to not what I usually do but I did in that case
C	mm
B	it's a very difficult language
C	yeah I expect some of them'll speak English there I expect they'll get away with it that's the trouble everywhere you go these days everybody's being
C	yeah they do yeah so erm
B	a cultural sort of er differences of
A	mm
B	very great make it very difficult
C	mm
B	but wonderful people
C	mm
A	er well we've been to again we've been to a lot of places and the places we would have quite liked to go perhaps to Boston or Washington but we'd have gone all the way round the southern hemisphere in nice weather and it'll be the end of March
C	oh so it'll be cold
A	so don't really want to carry winter clothes
C	mm
A	so we thought somewhere where it's gonna be warm and we've done San Francisco and Los Angeles and so
C	mm
A	and then the plane stops over in Dallas whether we like it or not and
C	oh right
A	and she went to visit and she was very taken with Dallas said it was really nice so we thought well if the plane's gonna stop there anyway
C	yeah
A	so we might as well have a couple of days could be
C	yeah good idea
A	two nights or something might only be one night actually
C	mm
A	cos it lands early in the morning so we've got all day
C	yeah then the following
A	all the next day on a lateish flight see something of
C	seven and a half weeks I I've been away for a month twice
A	yes a month is the longest I've ever done before
C	seven and a half weeks gonna be very
A	see if we're still speaking
C	was gonna say I I would I still speak be speaking to him after seven and a half weeks?
A	mm
C	but that'll be good fantastic
A	be interesting
C	mm would love to do something like that but I have to give up work first
B	well you'll have to reach retirement age
C	I know
B	work a bit harder
A	see it's all very well being the youngest
C	I know I've still gotta work
B	oh is
C	no
B	not at all?
A	not at all no?
C	no no he's given up he's sixty and decided well he absolutely hated the last contract that he did he really really really hated that it so he finished that and decided that he he didn't want to go back to Lloyds ever again he really didn't wanna do that he I think he'd be happy to do something and use his skills but not doing what he was doing under the pressure he was under and the politics what he really likes doing is right he he used to be the way that that the bank worked was that you'd be a project manager and you'd be responsible for
unknown_female	mm
C	and and it was constant politics and somebody you know lording it over each he just he just I can't deal with it now sorry I want to deliver a project and I know I can I'm good at that I can do do that but I can't deal with all this playing around bit telling people what I'm gonna deliver but I haven't got time to do it because I'm spending all my time reporting and what I'm gonna deliver
B	so do you get dinner on the table every night and erm all the housework done and
C	well sort of in theory
B	is he a house husband then?
C	yeah in theory and we need updating the kitchen actually so he's been doing a lot of work on that it's quite a difficult transition actually I find it quite difficult with him being at home and me going out to work so there are times where it's quite stressful and other times it makes it easier so I wouldn't say it's always plain sailing so it varies really you can get quite resentful on occasions and I don't like that side of myself
A	yeah I find it quite difficult having
C	yeah mm
B	I I had I went to a party on Saturday night and met an old friend and her husband's retired erm from teaching a head of department or whatever early retirement and he's at home all the time and she's got a job that's fifteen hours a week
unknown_female	mm
B	er which she used to do I think in two days and she's not stretched it to four days so that she can be away because he's always in the house
A	I've been saying for years I have to get a job
C	I I'll be honest with you that is quite
B	and she said it's driving her mad
C	it is it is quite difficult and and I think the things that erm because because he did this project work for the last eight years I suppose erm he erm you know he'd often do six months or a year and then have a few months off and but at the moment he had the he went back to work all the responsibilities of the house suddenly got handed to me even though I was working full time I never quite understood how this happened but because he was doing a longer journey somehow or another I got it all those responsibilities but I'm sort of adapting but I do find it quite difficult sometimes thinking actually I open the fridge and think there's nothing in here I wanna eat cos I never get to go to the shops and he has and I don't actually I get fed up with that I wanna go and buy my own stuff but somehow or another it doesn't seem to happen and erm certain things I'd you know he does this he's quite a good cook he does the cooking most of the time which is great but actually if I'm retired I don't want him I want to take back some of that I feel as though I've lost my kitchen
C	erm so I think there'll be another fight when I'm not working any more so how we work that one I don't know but he just does things in a very different way and I don't always want to do it that way I don't like the way he does it and I just think oh god why can't you do it like this?
B	and all those years he's put up with you doing it your way
C	he hasn't known any different has he?
B	I don't know you might have secretly been wondering why you do it
C	mm
A	you obviously haven't been training him properly because he should he should be doing it your way anyway if it's all been done like that all these years
C	I should should I? yeah
B	and then do you find things stored in different places?
C	erm well that's not so bad no that's alright that's okay
A	that should be very interesting we're having a new kitchen next month
B	mm
A	so I should be very interested cos
A	cos I don't know where they go
A	so once everything moves anyway I dread to think what it'll be like
C	oh dear I know yet he does get
A	does he does he cook?
C	yeah mm
B	not at all?
A	absolutely not
C	no
A	he's not interested in cooking at all
C	I know that's difficult isn't it? no
B	and what's it like having no children at home?
C	oh that's fine
A	lovely
C	yeah I don't have a problem with that at all really considering they've stayed around for so long really
A	mm yeah
C	I actually am not worried about that at all
A	well all the way through it's never bothered me at all
C	no it just it's
A	I was the mother dancing in the playground while others were crying on the
C	yeah no
A	it's just they've got their lives to live that's the next stage they go onto it and
C	that's right I'm sort of you know no I don't really and the thing is that I having a daughter is quite good cos they keep in contact you wouldn't know this not having a son
B	I can see it I observe it
C	boys don't hear from them
B	and you work in the same place and he lives just down the road?
C	I know it's funny isn't it?
A	and even when you hear from them you don't get to know what's going on
C	he doesn't work interestingly he supposed to be moving to
B	what you won't meet him for lunch there or anything?
C	I can't imagine in a million years he'd want to meet his mother for lunch can you?
B	why not? it'd be nice
C	I can't imagine he'd want to do that
B	mm
C	erm but you know that's fine
A	people keep telling me that they get better
B	mm right
A	he must be just about at the point where they get better actually
C	yeah he's twenty-three so maybe maybe I don't know we'll see
A	mm my cousin says that twenty-three is about the point when her son grew up
C	yeah and he has grown up he has grown up and he's fine but you know it's erm but no I'm actually I'm I find it fine did you find it fine when they left?
A	mm well it was done in stages coming and going
C	yeah yeah so I've had that coming and going
A	away from university then back after
C	yeah yeah I've had the coming and going as well
A	away
C	but I do think
A	but I do like them
C	yeah no I like having them around but I also am very pleased that they have built their own lives and they
C	have they did yeah absolutely erm really pleased about that
A	well and that they're able to cos there are so many kids that are
unknown_female	mm
A	or they don't have a job or
unknown_female	mm
A	whatever
C	yeah no I find it okay actually I quite like having the odd occasions where I like
A	that's a funny one cos even when they're all home I mean I haven't been working for several years now I've had had the house to myself most of the time but there's still always that
C	no I think yeah I think that's the only thing that
A	it's just having to allow for the fact that there's somebody else there because
C	mm yeah he was wasn't he?
A	cos it's not as though he was even home every night for his tea so just having he doesn't care what I do but I've you know if I'm going out I've got to say I'm going out to I'm going to Tesco or I'm going up to
C	yeah
A	but but I feel
A	I didn't have to tell anybody
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah that's it no it's got it's quite interesting isn't it? the different stages of one's life but you know he he keeps saying oh I'm gonna find some voluntary work or some other work and it just and a year had gone by and he still hasn't so I just wondered but I can't imagine me not wanting to do anything in terms of I want to do some voluntary work and stuff like that
A	but equally you probably need some time to to think about what you want to do and
C	I think you're er there I would think you're absolutely right
A	and get to the point where you are fed up of being at home and the novelty's worn off and you
C	cos
A	mm
C	she's spent six she spent six months now isn't it?
A	is it that long now?
C	yeah she gave up in
A	course it was yes
C	so she's had six months now
A	yeah
C	and erm of you know so I think that's a very wise thing to give up work at the beginning
A	to take stock and decide
C	of the summer and having the summer off which is exceptionally this is a friend of mine lives in er
A	she would have been here tonight if it wasn't her daughters' birthday
C	oh it's
A	not to rush into classes in this and volunteering for that and so
C	yeah
A	mm
C	what are you writing on these notes then?
B	just writing the topics that we've been talking about
C	oh
B	mm
C	so how many minutes have we done? we ought to keep going a bit longer
B	we've been talking for twenty I haven't got my glasses on twenty-nine minutes I think
C	mm
B	so when are you going to retire then? what what age ninety-five?
C	I'm not gonna make a decision I'm gonna just make a decision at the time I feel like it
B	but I mean you know pension wise and things
C	er well my
B	cos how old are you now?
C	fifty-six and a half
B	oh god you're a baby you'll be able to work a few more years
A	yeah but you won't reach that for ages yet
B	and then you'll retire and
C	erm
A	well then you can have the house to yourself
C	I think if he doesn't find something in the next year he won't erm
B	does he does he ever go off for sort of holidays with other people?
C	mm goes skiing on his own
B	mm cos that's quite a good thing isn't it?
C	mm he's always at
C	yeah
A	holidays
C	doesn't he?
A	no
C	really?
C	hasn't he?
A	he's had the you know he's had friends at school he had friends at university and they've all just fizzled out
C	and he hasn't felt the need for that then?
A	no
C	isn't that strange now
A	don't you ever I mean you know if there's
C	yeah absolutely mm
A	so on but
C	he doesn't search out I mean
A	no he's quite self sufficient
C	no just I came home tonight and
A	mm
C	has lots of friends and things but he's not bothered
A	mm mm mm
C	he's very different
A	partly he says it as you said before he's got to do it all he's got to be so sociable for work
C	yeah
A	he's had to be sociable and get on with cos he gets on with he can get on with anybody
C	mm I know
A	but he doesn't particularly
C	mm
A	mm
C	I think as you get older and your world get becomes smaller because of work I think friends actually are really almost more important aren't they?
A	whereas I'm forever off with the girls and
C	mm
A	cos there's a bunch of us we're now the diamond
B	does does he go to this men's erm first Friday of the month?
C	mm
A	he's done one
B	the men's
A	and he is intending to go again but he didn't really like it
B	oh didn't
C	oh didn't he?
B	did
C	mm
A	with I don't know who was there when he went I don't think
C	no cos he just
A	cos he said there was nobody really he knew
C	cos there's
A	and he said well they talked about stories from the Daily Mail and I don't
C	yeah he doesn't go every time I must admit
A	he he said he will give it another go but it just hasn't worked out that he's been about to go but erm he wasn't
C	oh dear
B	was that recently or some time ago?
A	oh
B	cos
A	must must have been three or four months ago
C	is
B	he's he's been twice now
A	mm
C	and how did he like it?
B	I think I well you'll have to ask him
C	yeah mm
B	I can't speak for him but I think he enjoyed it I mean it's it's funny isn't it? because women we automatically go and
A	yeah and just
B	no no sort of issue or
C	no
B	anything but you know they it's all sort of funny about who's going and shall I go shan't I go? and yeah it's like sort of erm
A	I mean there's a whole bunch of people turn up on Fridays and
B	teenagers
A	I don't know they're people
C	yeah
A	you know there's quite a that that lady we were talking
C	her son had got married erm
A	erm he was an actor got married at the
C	oh erm
A	right yeah there's there's quite
C	she's just recently retired yeah
A	cos it's quite lot of people we don't know
C	I looked down the table and thought I'm the only one here working
B	the other problem is of course that you I don't know cos I haven't
C	why aren't you gonna come? yeah we used to get you used to come didn't you? yeah well you say you used to come
B	well no one used to well in the old days I did
C	yeah
C	I know you used to go
B	but I'm usually working and then you go and you sit in one seat
C	I know yeah
B	and you don't circulate
C	yeah
B	and I mean it's pot luck who you happen to sit next to
A	mm
C	mm that is that is the trouble with it
B	and you know sometimes you don't wanna give up your working time to go and sit there with someone that you don't wanna talk to for two hours well that's rude isn't it?
C	well because I because I always don't get there until quarter past one because I don't finish work till one
B	ah so that's the trick you come in late and sidle in where you want
C	no you have to end up at the end
A	it depends where there's space doesn't it?
C	that's where there's space so you end up at the end so we'll have to organise to come up
C	that's what you
A	why don't you ring a bell and you all change seats
C	mm
A	yes yes and or there's some conversation to have and it's oh that sounds interesting
B	yeah
C	mm mm
B	but it's a great idea that I think
A	I think it is because
B	to to meet once a month definitely on a set time at a set time but I mean how long have the men been doing it now?
C	mm not very long six months
A	yeah
C	I reckon
unknown_female	mm
C	but not
B	do you think it's working?
C	mm I think so well the ladies one's been going a lot longer than that
B	yeah
C	and I thought I wondered why you weren't
B	the ladies one's been going on and off for about thirty-five years
C	well I know it has hasn't it? I mean I used to go a lot when the kids were younger
unknown_female	mm
C	we were always my
B	and the Friday evening one as well when
C	yeah no I found it very useful because cos your children are all much
B	really?
C	mm when the kids were younger erm two actually two pieces of advice one was childcare don't worry about it only worry a year in advance because in the next the following year they would have thought they would have grown up and
unknown_female	oh
C	and the second piece of advice I took from you was erm you know how girls all fall out
unknown_female	mm
C	and erm was it
B	no that's the wrong years it was
C	right erm
