A	right there you go so what were you saying? you've got plans for Halloween?
B	yeah I'm going to a murder mystery
A	where's that?
B	at erm Holiday Inn sort of near
A	okay
B	and then if you're part of this group you get them extra discounted if you're not part of the group you get them discounted
A	so is it just something that comes round on like a work email that shows?
B	yeah er well it's there's like a folder like erm of events that er they have cos er they do all sorts like trips to erm France like for the Christmas markets
A	oh right?
B	and they do all sorts of bits
A	so er so could you do it so like if one person decided they wanted to go from work they could go and join in cos it's a group like as in like the murder mystery's on?
B	yeah yeah
A	so you don't have to get a certain amount of people?
B	yeah usually yeah I think that's what it normally is
A	mm that sounds really good
B	yeah so it'll be good I mean erm I might sign up to the actual group cos that gets you er a lot cheaper and I think it's like fourteen pounds if you're part of the group or
A	okay
B	or whatever or eleven pounds or something it's only like one pound a month but
A	oh sounds really good
B	yeah so it should be good fun
A	and giving sweets out to the few children that might come this far
B	yeah but no one ever does
B	not really
A	look marinated tuna
B	I can't really smell anything not properly
A	mm smells nice
A	smells nice
B	yeah I'm sure it smells nice I'm sure it tastes nice
B	I yeah I just can't verify that right now
A	well I went to a murder mystery although er it's a few years ago now gosh a lot of years ago actually
B	yeah
A	I can't even remember
B	yeah
A	and you went for the weekend and you actually had the time to go round
B	yeah
A	erm but you can do them where you actually go for a whole week I think or not a whole week a weekend
B	yeah
A	and it starts and goes over the weekend
B	that sounds good
A	but I tell you something actually bit of a tip erm what they actually said was afterwards we could've actually gone and asked them questions not as in who was it? but we could've maybe asked the people that were doing it and the characters you you could actually ask them some quite obvious questions I can't even think what it was but they said that if we'd asked this they would've told us so and so or if the if we'd asked so and so
B	yeah because I think you all tend to get like a card don't you? with information on it
A	mm
B	about who you are and what you're doing
A	yeah
B	and the idea is to go round and to speak to people obviously and find out information
A	yeah that's it
B	erm I have done er a little one before
A	oh yeah what was that? with er?
B	on a guide camp
A	oh
A	yeah yeah
B	sorry
A	I think when we did it the people
B	yeah
A	with what was happening when you've been told the scenario
B	yeah yeah and I don't
B	yeah
A	and we'd planned to do something and somebody came up with the idea of it but it
B	yeah
A	and then actually we we said we'd do it and we were gonna go and stay at the hotel as well but it got it was cancelled cos there weren't enough people
B	yeah
A	it's certainly something I would like to do again
A	yeah I think you'll you'll have a laugh with er so who did you say is going?
A	right
B	and er
A	mm
B	so yeah should be good
A	sounds alright
B	yeah so no should be good fun erm
A	yeah
B	in everyone's pocket
A	oh I
B	yeah make sure it's not gonna snap
A	cos it if you
B	er
A	well I know you always do but I never do do I? I've never
A	I never have a a cover cos I like it
B	I have a cover cos I drop it
A	and I
B	I dropped mine under my car today
A	did you?
B	literally like not even just just slightly under like in the middle under my car
A	oh god
B	bearing in mind it had been raining and I'm like how am I gonna get that back?
B	and I had to get my the mac that I've got in the back of my car not obviously an Apple Mac like er you know coat mac
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and I put that on the floor leant on it and then like leaning right under my car to get my phone back
B	cos I had to decide like do I really slowly creep forward cos it wasn't near any wheels
A	yeah
B	so do I like really slowly creep forward and risk driving over it? or do I erm do I lean under my car?
A	like like
B	er yeah exactly yeah
A	that was
B	and I didn't didn't really fancy doing that cos the thing is I've only had it like a couple of days
B	yeah so I'm like erm
A	yeah
B	can we trade back?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and this woman was coming out from one of the side roads
A	yeah
B	and she
A	mm
B	even though nobody was letting them in but they hadn't been there long
A	yeah
B	they'd only just sort of pulled up
A	yeah
B	but they were edging out and out of principle I never let anyone in if they're edging out because I think it's rude
A	mm
B	so I didn't let her out and she was right alongside me and she flashed her lights at me
A	mm
B	because I didn't let her out
A	yeah
B	and then she pulled in behind me and
A	no
B	my I have right of way here
A	yeah
B	I don't have to let you in if you'd have waited patiently I would've let you in
A	yeah exactly
B	because you didn't I didn't but she was like and then she had her lights on and they were on like full beam and I'm like you're really annoying me now
B	so I was like yeah that's all that's the that's the fun of driving my route to work though cos it's
A	mm
B	always really busy so like
A	mm
B	there's people coming out everywhere
A	mm
B	so you get some muppets
A	mm
B	people that think they own the roads and they don't I own the roads
A	I think that time of the morning everyone it's like rush hour isn't it?
B	school run
A	everyone's going to work going to school got to be somewhere dropping someone
B	yeah I know
A	and and they do people get all wound up you think the the best thing is if everyone just chilled and relaxed and like yeah you let
B	mm
A	somebody in and you don't
B	yeah
A	try and push in and and then everything would move a lot better wouldn't it?
A	yeah
B	indicator on just waiting
A	yeah
B	so I stopped and let him in
B	no she'd gone the other way by that point I think erm it was no actually no she hadn't she would've seen it yeah probably I was like yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I like it when you're driving along and you sort of get a chain reaction so
B	yeah
A	you stop and let somebody in and then they're going along and then they stop and let somebody else in
B	yeah yeah
A	and then they're going along and then that person stops and you think it's like good karma isn't it?
B	it's like they say if you if you smile at somebody erm
A	yeah
B	in the day
A	yeah
B	then that normally make their day feel better or they'll then smile at someone else
A	mm
B	I I just think that er if I randomly smiled at a stranger on the street they'd probably think weirdo what's she doing?
A	yeah
B	crazy and run the other direction
A	mm
B	so
A	ah
B	I'm never really sure about that
A	er
A	I might go and get some more fish tomorrow
B	oh yeah
A	did you want anything?
B	er
A	or you need to clean yours actually before you put anything in
B	I need to clean mine
A	yeah
B	I need to get some more sawtails because I've only I've got a male and a female I need to get another female
A	did you lose one then?
B	she got egg bound and died
A	oh did she? was it the white one?
B	the white one
A	oh bless her that's a shame
A	yeah
B	she didn't have much of a fun life did she? bless her
A	no no no
B	then she got egg bound
A	that's why you say you need er probably a couple more females
B	I need yeah I need I need at least another one
A	well are you going to do your fish tonight?
B	mm I need to do
A	pardon?
B	need to water
A	oh yeah I was just gonna say if you did if you cleaned them out tonight I'd get you some more but I'm not gonna get you more to put in in there cos that's not fair on them cos er when they've just been moved it needs to be cleaner
B	yeah I need to clean em out but it's
A	mm
B	it's gonna be late and I don't wanna be too late for tea tonight to bed tonight
A	no
