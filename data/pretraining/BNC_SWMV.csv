A	quite like it quite nice
B	yeah
A	it's um
B	in here?
A	it's good yeah yeah
B	haven't been for ages
A	uh yeah
B	haven't had salt and vinegar crisps for ages
A	I like salt and vinegar
A	mine's I prefer cheese and onion
B	I like  I like  well I like
A	your favourite crisp is cheese and onion?
B	that's a loud phone ring
A	beef McCoy?
B	like a ridgey
A	McCoy they're they're the ridge ones aren't they?
B	aha
A	they're like uh quite crunchy
B	I like them
A	I like I think they're a little bit too crunchy
B	I don't like them Kettle Chips
A	they're okay but
B	I think they taste like they haven't been cooked like
A	kettles are alright but
B	I don't think it's the flavour that bothers me
A	kind of it's quite a lot of effort to chew them isn't it?
B	I think it's like they
A	yeah yeah it's a lot of
B	yeah
A	and I mean these ones are
B	get them at like posh parties don't you? Kettle Chips
A	I don't know I
B	I remember they had them at that party that we went to
A	oh right
B	aha it was
A	they had like a
B	caterers yeah
A	caterers um
B	it was funny
A	um
B	the beef was really nice
A	um
B	it was a weird party
A	didn't know where to put my coat
B	and then the woman whofs
B	she certainly had had
A	and um expressed her fondness for Middlesbrough Football Club
B	weird
A	talked
B	yeah
A	and the
B	yeah but every single thing like
A	it was like
B	purple or pink
A	it was pretty good I mean
B	it's weird though
A	I
B	I don't think I would have it just like one colour
A	if I if we had a garden
B	it's like people have Christmas trees
A	I'd
B	yeah
A	crops
B	like things that are useful
A	A lawn for kids' sports maybe
B	yeah
A	but I wouldn't say that was essential but
B	no
A	couple of chickens yeah
B	ducks?
A	but if you get ducks it means you gotta get a pond haven't you?
B	think so
A	otherwise they just go
B	chickens just need some dust don't they?
A	gotta get a pond and once you get a pond you gotta get like uh one of them things that that that Conservative MP got
B	A duck house?
A	like a island in his  in his  pond
B	it's funny
A	which he charged to uh
B	british taxpayer
B	ha?
A	cat?
B	but I'm allergic to cats
A	yeah well they'll have to
B	cats don't stay outside
A	um
B	made short work of those
A	yeah well there's plenty more where that came from
B	if there's er um
A	yeah the cat  the cat  will just leave you yeah
B	like your cat
A	they do that anyway they they they're not very um they're not  they're not  that loyal
B	no
A	she took a bit of a liking to my cat Misty
B	and your dad
B	excuse me
A	that was just
B	auntie
A	I think it's it's partly funny because of the implausibility of of um
B	yeah
B	so funny imagine of your name was
A	Cos uh
B	might be
A	and I saw a programme about him
B	might he might be
A	he was in Brazil and they captured him and put him in a  in a  a sack
B	yeah
A	and uh
B	but he was like out wasn't he cos he's not very well
A	then they  then they  put him on a
B	or is he alive still?
A	what?
B	he's alive still isn't he?
A	I think so
B	Cos was he not let out of prison cos he was dying?
A	I'm not sure
B	or am I blurring two stories
A	so they captured him and then they sort of put him on a sort of went partying in um on some Caribbean island or something and then the the papers had got news of it um
B	yeah
A	um
B	there was some people involved in that robbery that
A	yeah um it's a  it's a  real like legendary robbery isn't it cos of um the the large amount and the success of it
B	they didn't know all the people involved
A	um
B	Cos I watched
A	yeah was it just that  was it just that  that that did that or was it another one?
B	well it's happened loads of times but that's the one I have got the other part of that to watch
A	I'm not sure it's Sunday
B	I don't know when that is
A	but um
B	I was thinking maybe we should go and see
A	what is on Sunday?
B	maybe we should go and see The Artist the film
A	yeah if you wanna I mean where's the  where's the  cinema
B	there's a few
A	well obviously this pub used to be a cinema didn't it?
B	it did yeah
A	oh yeah the uh
B	that's a picture house
B	next door to there
A	um yeah
B	and that's like a old sort of um
A	odeon or something
B	yeah like you can uh like like sort of old like red seats and you know like the old styles
A	yeah
B	and then there's one near where I work too
A	right
B	well James Bond's out this year I mean
B	hold the front page
A	what's it called d'you know?
B	James Bond? What?
A	what's the James Bond film gonna be called?
B	oh um
A	um
B	yeah
A	he's good
B	bit pouty but yeah
A	well he's got a certain way of using his lips that makes him look like he's he's pouting and
B	I like him though
A	but that's
B	although I did like the
A	he's kind of he's really good I thought
B	I did like the cheesy James Bonds though
A	like Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore and stuff?
B	yeah
A	yeah well it's
B	he's really hairy
A	it's just it's not no it's not really as cheesy now is it but uh
B	no but he's like the innuendo's really really like heavy-handed
B	yeah
A	but I don't have any on video but uh
B	they're always on at Christmas though I I mean
B	christmas Day night yeah
A	after after you've eaten your uh after you've eaten your um dinner
B	yeah
A	Cos there's gonna be a James Bond on
B	I never we never have the telly on though
B	too many
A	you've got family yeah
B	yeah
A	but if you've got a few and you're sort of sitting there maybe it's not as good as if you're talking I think
B	yeah
A	James Bond is a  is a  bank holiday thing isn't it?
B	so d'you think that your mam and dad and that are alright about you not going this Christmas or?
A	yeah I reckon I mean they'll come afterwards won't they and
B	yeah
A	they'll probably have to go and see
B	and we'll go before
A	they'll probably have to go and see
B	perhaps yeah
A	or or something so uh
B	yeah
A	they come and it
B	they did yeah it was nice
A	they visited us on what was it
B	um
A	we came  we came  on the twenty-seventh
B	we'll have to check when me nana's having her party
A	literally leaving in the middle of the party
B	I know
A	went to a party for like two hours and
B	we'll have to double check that this time
A	I quite like the idea of coming back on the twenty-seventh but I also like the idea of having a gap
B	nana's party
A	like having the Boxing Day off and then having a party on the twenty-seventh
B	yeah me too
A	but
B	what did we do on Boxing Day? Did we just hang about?
A	I kind of think that if that we should try and do it again like
B	what d'you mean?
A	like go back on the twenty-seventh again and go to the party
B	and miss me nana's party?
A	we didn't really miss it
B	no I'd like to go
A	maybe we could
B	maybe I could use
A	maybe we'll turn up and just come back on the twenty-eighth?
B	maybe I could use some
A	what we could do is we could come back on twenty-eighth and have our parents come round on the twenty-eighth
B	yeah might be quite stressful though
A	yeah
B	we'll have loads of washing and like
A	but but I really enjoyed having um those extra couple of days like
B	and if we get delayed
A	I enjoyed having like the thirtieth
B	yeah
A	free
B	oh I might
A	and sort of
B	well I might take like
A	you mean like um?
B	well this yeah I had three days off at the start of the year
A	yeah
B	oh yeah we were looking at the pictures on Friday weren't we?
A	yeah uh
B	really nice yeah
A	like
B	I really like those you know those those antler light fittings
A	yeah there's some funny uh it's an old sort of manor house isn't wasn't it and um
B	and I like the sort of colour scheme it was like a lot of like greens uh like dark greens and
A	yeah
B	actually not too dissimilar to in here really
A	ay?
B	not too dissimilar to in here really
A	well what've we got we've got like a
B	you know what I mean like
A	dark brown sort of
B	like the wood and like uh like that green on that wall over there
A	oh yeah yeah
B	they had that sort of colour didn't they?
A	yeah it was well I remember it being quite cream
B	was there?
A	I
B	there was a lot of like nice light fittings and stuff and and that purple billiard table that was good
A	oh yeah um there was always people playing on it
B	yeah
A	they sort of spread out and do different things so
B	yeah
A	uh did it? I dunno if that kept on all night or if it sort of stopped
B	yeah that's
A	they had a band on for a bit but then I think they were just playing  they were just playing  records
B	think so
A	then uh so the dance floor bit and then they had like um uh
B	yeah
A	later on they they got out some speakers and played some music
B	that was so like such preparation though
B	Cos what time did people go to bed like?
A	four or five or something
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah I was
A	uh we went to bed at about three or
B	yeah
A	um
B	I was so drained by then
B	that Wednesday when we just sat on the sofa
A	it's
A	that's pretty good um
B	he still
A	we had  we had  a couple of ciders and then
B	wine we had some wine
A	three bottles of wine went uh
A	then then we cracked open the cider
B	uh
A	um and then uh
B	I'm the very picture of
A	you you're good at keeping  you're good at keeping  uh
B	well I don't like it that that much that's the thing
A	you don't really like vodka? Yeah well
B	I don't really like vodka very much
A	it's not my favourite cos it doesn't have a flavour but
B	maybe I should try and flavour it
A	but that's what you're supposed to do you're supposed to like have it with uh things on
B	although not the  not the  chilli
A	yeah I think chilli and um
B	chilli's probably a bad move
A	chilli and and alcohol is is uh
B	bit difficult
A	it's tough
B	no it was vodka
A	put
B	yeah that's right
A	just ginger the ginger goes up your nose like the fizz from it really stings
B	I've got some ginger in the fridge actually
A	yeah we've got some fresh ginger so we're looking uh looking like the uh plan is forming
B	no I've gotta go to work tomorrow
A	oh
B	maybe yeah
A	gotta wait for it to uh um
B	yeah maybe we should
A	uh perfuse or infuse or diffuse or whatever the word is
B	probably all of those
A	that's that's our anniversary innit um
B	Cos I do still
A	going out and we can go the Algerian restaurant
B	there's loads down there
A	on the
B	yeah
A	good ourselves and then
B	Cos that paella was really good
A	could have like a lamb could like could make a lamb tagine
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean um
B	but it is nice
A	the the advantage of a restaurant is that you
B	yeah
A	get to be served by the people and you can have drinks and stuff and
B	yeah
A	well we
B	yeah but rarely like
A	like if it was up to me I think I'd probably go more often over there
B	yeah
A	it's just a different preference for us
B	I suppose
A	I mean there is a bit of a problem round here obviously is that a lot of the pubs here close at twelve so if you were going out late somewhere and then coming back then you couldn't stop anywhere anywhere in this northern
B	on the way back no
A	northern central ring of Cambridge but
B	yeah but it's still like a fair old walk from there to here
A	well yeah but I don't personally mind
B	suppose you could get a taxi
A	but yeah of course a taxi back
B	but um
A	and that's what
B	yeah
A	but yeah if we we go out and then sort of
B	so d'you think we should do that then?
A	uh but uh but on the other hand obviously it's good to make your own stuff because then you can can get more more quality food perhaps than a restaurant
B	but I
A	well um
B	I wouldn't be like Okay I've just had a giant meal let's walk all the way over into town
A	I mean I think  I think  I'd probably be more like that but
B	yeah but I know I mean me like I dunno if I would
A	yeah I mean it's it's it's up to preference isn't it? Um
B	dunno if I would
A	but I think once again with a restaurant like if you've you've
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	like all that sort of uh
B	that's why I don't like getting like set menus cos I just think
A	whatever what's whatever your favourite Indian is is a pathia or something?
B	I like a pathia I like a dansak
A	dansak the Persian one
B	actually I like I think I probably like the sides better I think I would
A	thali is um is like like a
B	Cos then you get a few little
A	Tapas style dish with lots of little bits
B	because then like I think I
A	um
B	oh it's fine
A	cool
B	I know yeah
A	been talking for like thirty minutes and
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's been a few times hasn't there when it's just a bit it's a bit unwieldy sometimes actually
B	I know
A	yeah I mean so
B	well we're going for an Indian with your parents though aren't we? We don't need to go for an Indian on Friday
A	yeah yeah cos
B	the second?
A	we'll be going out probably for an Indian
B	day before Steve's birthday
A	then then it's it would be better if we had more better Thai meal Thai places around here but I don't really know
B	there's a few though
A	yeah but
B	why don't we go to that?
A	I won't wasn't tremendously impressed with either of the two um
B	why don't we go to the Vietnamese place then?
A	well yeah that'd be interesting but but I want to go out cos it cos um I suspect that it  that it  won't be as good as it could be
B	expensive? Well how d'you know?
A	Cos the last two weren't very amazing
B	I thought they were
A	was it? I'm not sure that I remember
B	I think yours wasn't very nice but mine was nice
A	I I I don't have a positive
B	I know but
A	but uh
B	just
A	yeah I mean it's a bit of a
B	but as
A	whereas if you're here in
B	yeah
A	um
B	but even the
A	do you do end up with a lower quality sometimes when when you've got  when you've got  a high demand
B	yeah
A	which one was it?
B	for our anniversaire
A	oh yeah that
B	that was lovely
A	uh
B	but less said about that the better really
A	which was  which was  nice but deadly uh
A	for some for yourself but uh
B	it's so annoying
A	it's a shame cos there's so much great seafood out there to be eaten
B	I know
A	but um
B	well I like it that's the problem
A	yeah
B	I just don't think I can
A	so I booked  so I booked  into
B	I know but
A	uh but then we unbooked because uh you reckoned that it would would be
B	D'you want us to re-rebook?
A	no no no no I mean
B	yeah it was nice that Turkish one
A	like I wouldn't  I wouldn't  mind going to like a Turkish barbecue and having like like uh barbecue prawns and that or
B	where we went on my birthday?
A	yeah on your birthday uh twenty ten yeah
B	God was it that long ago?
A	twenty-seventh birthday
B	showing me age
A	well was the end of twenty ten wasn't it? Oh but of course the meal we had on your birthday last year twenty eleven was my all-time favourite restaurant meal I think
B	I mean that was pretty nice
A	uh it's was brilliant
B	maybe it can be like a birthday tradition
A	hotpot
B	it's funny though cos the restaurant's kinda crappy isn't it like? I mean it's not it does doesn't look brilliant like does it?
A	the the the uh you're referring to
A	what's that street called um
B	um
A	the
A	um yeah something like
B	oh
A	Jesus Christ
B	uh
A	gonna
A	I'll end up going on  going on  looking for humorous
B	I'm gonna have to look it up
B	I can't remember
A	uh
B	that's so annoying
A	but the buffets are kind of cool because they're they're sort of they're very low key you know which is typical of typical of Chinese um
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah it wasn't like luxurious by any means was it?
A	um there was  there was  the one we went in which was called something like
B	that's right
A	it was called something like
B	there's a Wikipedia page called Chinatowns in Europe
A	yeah I think it's a good China town that that Newcastle one like uh
B	yeah it's nice
A	I mean it really is uh
B	quartier Chinoeese Chinoise
A	sorry?
B	in the X X I I I E arrondissement
A	the Treizième
B	treizième
A	where's the treizième? Is that  is that  near um?
B	belle Belle Ville in Paris
A	is the Treizième not near the Eiffel Tower or?
B	uh I dunno I'll just press it here
A	I I
B	and then the Latin Quarter's the seventh isn't it? The seventh
A	I don't know
B	I think so
A	the?
B	le de France
A	you mean the um
B	the twenty arrondissements of France
A	you mean the the Left Bank? The the the kebab area?
B	also known as Arrondissement de Gobelins
A	gobelins
B	arrondissement of the Goblins
A	does it have an N E on the end or just N?
B	what?
A	is it I N E in Gobelin?
B	G O B E L I N S
A	gobelins
B	no Goblins
A	okay
B	uh there's the map there
A	so it's
B	did we go? I don't remember Chinatown in Paris
A	it's quite a big area that
B	ooh when? Have you got something planned?
A	well I'm sure we'll visiting again before before we die
B	aww
A	and I'd be kinda disappointed if we didn't cos it's uh it's a great place to visit isn't it I mean but yeah we'll we'll go there is it is that not? Where's
A	yeah we've not got much of a Chinatown here in uh
B	uh no
A	oh um
B	Italy? Ah no no I've been to the one in New York
A	is there? There's one in Rome isn't there? Didn't we?
B	dunno I'm just having a look
A	that's another place I'd like to visit
B	Portugal Russia United Kingdom
A	and I've seen the Birmingham one as well
B	well yes
A	I've seen the Liverpool one it's got a bit uh Chinese gate
B	and the London one yeah
A	they've got a name them they've got a name those gates haven't they
B	oh there's the Liverpool one look
A	yeah
B	dunno
B	it says The Chinatown in Liverpool is the oldest Chinese community in Europe
A	yeah I mean obviously Liverpool was a massive uh port from uh uh associated with the slave trade isn't it?
B	sorry I'll put that away
A	associated with the the triangular you know the trade triangle
B	who China?
A	no Liverpool
B	oh
A	the trade between America and uh Europe and Africa
B	Africa?
A	the triangle
B	yeah
A	well of course it's terribly declined now but uh
B	I dunno
A	Liverpool?
B	yeah
A	A night out
B	well
A	uh as for a fact
B	it's good that we sort of found a new bit
A	yeah we sort of wandered into somewhere didn't we?
B	it's funny because I mean
A	it's good that they linked it up in the
B	proper place
A	yeah I mean cos like
B	yeah
A	decent enough like public transport in terms of trains
B	but I remember like getting the bus from
A	that this is the south side of
B	and it used to  it used to  take ah easily an hour and a half like
A	it's like a massive chunk of map that is innit?
B	no not really
A	it's across the A To Z
B	must be twenty miles or something
A	it's it's a big
B	no it's not that far
B	Sunderland and Newcastle are fifteen miles away
A	yeah but you were on the south side of uh Sunderland
B	yeah but that's not like ten miles out of Sunderland is it?
A	no
B	it's like one mile
A	yeah I know
B	three miles maybe
A	um
B	maybe three miles
A	yeah so uh Sunderland has a couple of Chinese restaurants in it doesn't it Chinese buffet and that's something that we're lacking here in Cambridge that we don't have a Chinese buffet do we?
B	oh yeah Panda
A	all you can eat
B	um
A	I bet there's some on
A	so traditional Chinese buffet
B	ten ten quid yeah
A	and you eat one of everything that they've got apart from the
A	and uh
B	you don't mean me?
A	um go get get sausage and chips with curry sauce and uh
B	and maybe extra prawn toasts
A	which you can do in some Chinese buffets and um
B	I know you can
B	that was good though when they brought that hotpot out
A	the humiliation
B	when they brought that hotpot out and I just couldn't believe how many chilli like dried chillies were in it like
A	oh yeah the that hotpot was
B	I was just bemused
A	Cos cos with the hotpot you also get access to the  to the  regular buffet as well
B	yeah that was so good
A	it's like you've got the hotpot buffet which is like a
B	yeah
A	get your hotpot turn it set it onto uh there's different settings
B	Cook
A	there's different like they like eighty degrees was like
B	yeah soup
A	tea or something
B	it was like soup yeah there was a like a soup button wasn't there?
A	sorta like that
B	yeah
A	two hundred or something was like a really hot setting
B	yeah it was like a separated bit
A	and um one of them was really hot it had about fifty little dried chillies floating in it
B	that was medium as well you know
B	the chillies
A	if
B	yeah
A	that was quite painful and if you eat fifty of them or something
B	ah it was so tasty
A	yeah
B	we took some pictures of it
A	they sort of the broth that they had like
B	like the Chinese folk were laughing at us like uh taking pictures
A	I think that um they were it was just us and a big table of Chinese sort of students or something
B	yeah
A	and uh and I sort of suspected that that they were talking about us in Chinese
B	they definitely were
A	and laughing at us for being
B	it doesn't matter though
A	because the cos there there weren't any other English people like
B	it was like apartheid yeah
A	well it's brilliant because it's um
B	but we should have got it before like why didn't we? Why didn't?
A	it's like a raclette isn't it? It's like a Swiss
B	ah
A	I really wanna get one actually I wanna buy a hotpot
B	well I looked for them
A	like a stove thing
B	all you can see was like they don't have the stove bit they just have like the
A	um
B	but it was really nice
A	yeah I know it was  it was  delicious uh ah and in fact it's my favourite meal of the year I think
B	that was last last year?
A	if not of the decade
B	of the century?
A	including the
B	it was really good
A	that's a good  that's a good  task actually I'm I'm like
B	actually no
A	na they don't like um
B	D'you remember when we had the tapas with them and he was like horrified?
A	well I don't know I mean he
B	he was like That one's mine
A	he he says  he says  negative things but whether he really
B	yeah
A	you know he he didn't refuse to like
B	no I think he was just wasn't what he was used to
A	he he he's very vocal isn't he but I don't know if he really hates it
B	but I suppose though like if they just go for meals where like it's just you know like they go for curries a lot don't they or like you know like
A	um well not not in a tapas restaurant no I mean
