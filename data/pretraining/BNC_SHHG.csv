B	chat like
A	flirty way
B	but yeah
A	but he needs to chat to meet up

A	and he wants to get together and
B	what's he doing at the moment?
A	mm
B	mm
A	erm
B	okay that's cool
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I know how long did this been going on for? like two years now?
B	the second yeah
A	yeah on November the second I will be single for two years
B	it's like I've always said you know if you are happy with the level of it and you can handle it it's fine but when it gets to the time when it's just like dude shut up right
A	yeah no
B	I mean would any part of you ever wanna get back with him?
A	I think maybe in a few years
B	yeah
A	maybe in the future but not now I like I I still really care about him
B	well no of course like
A	and I he means he means a lot to me
B	I'm not saying that it's just that
A	no
B	kind of thing that
A	oh yeah no no
B	when it was like you know
A	mm no yeah
B	I know that you're much stronger than that but I'm just saying I'm just like mm okay
A	oh no no no
B	unless you decide not to
A	yeah like
B	mm
A	but I don't wanna be with him and I know that I don't wanna be with him
B	and you're always gonna be more than just friends because of what you were like
A	yeah but I know that in this moment in time in my life I don't wanna be with him
B	could be but not for me yeah
A	oh Justin Bieber so he could be the love of my life
A	oh yes Boyce Avenue yes we should get tickets probably the London one is easier for you is it? or
B	they are
A	to where?
A	oh yeah Salzburg yeah
B	and erm she was you know so I said look I'm gonna book something for the BA sale but it's in September but we're really gonna
A	yeah
B	like that I kept telling you about erm
A	yeah
B	she could afford it she just feels bad to go
A	yeah
B	so like screw it it's your fiftieth birthday this year
A	so are you taking her or?
B	I'm taking her
A	ah
B	so I've paid for her
A	okay
B	I don't think the thing is that if it was
A	they had a Nottingham tour yeah or Nottingham Space
B	I don't think like I'd get to like erm so so I was like well if I come up and see you and I was like how do I get to mine from here?
A	mm
B	then that would be fair enough cos it would turn out well one of them was on a Friday I think and that was the Nottingham one and one of them was on a Sunday and I was like is it gonna be tricky for both of us
A	yeah
B	to get back on a Sunday night? like do you know that kind of way? I was a bit like if it starts at half seven it won't finish until nine ten
A	mm
B	it's alright on the
A	yeah
B	what it's like to
A	so we could do the Nottingham the Nottingham is fine for me
B	that's why I was like well in Cardiff we could always do like a mini
A	yeah
B	mini little trip like out there like cos Cardiff I really like Cardiff as a place so I was like we could always just like go
A	I haven't been to Cardiff
B	go on a Saturday and then like
A	yeah
B	hang out there for the day go to the gig
A	yeah
B	have a few drinks and then mooch around on the Sunday like
A	yeah
B	if you want and I don't know what it's like getting there from
B	come to
A	yeah come to
B	if you came to
A	yeah
B	go to Cardiff on the Saturday
A	so when is that next March?
B	yeah so it's
A	yeah
B	not for a while
A	yeah
B	so we we have time so I was just like are you gonna be in the country by that point or is it June? I can't remember
A	I am gonna be in the country in March I think if I go to Oz it'll be in June
B	cool
A	the decision is either to go to Oz for a year
B	right
A	or to go for
B	to do psychology?
A	exactly to do psychology
B	how long will it take full time a year?
A	a year to do the psychology conversion and then a year to do the next masters
B	I like the idea of three months just not because it means that you're here for longer but it's just that kind of thing where it gives you enough of a break from work
A	exactly it means I can
B	to then start
A	get yeah start again exactly
B	and then if you wanted to go back to Australia afterwards you'd have a trade in which to go back
A	exactly
B	and get work visa
A	that's what I think
B	I'm really excited you're definitely gonna go though like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's really exciting
A	I'm gonna
B	yeah well so I'll move to
A	erm
B	maybe it will be your student discount
A	mm
B	instead of being me
A	it'll go into
B	oh is it? by a lot is it?
A	no not in the grand scheme of things it's erm
B	right
A	so not in the end in the grand scheme of things it's not a lot more but
B	but it
A	still a grand yeah
B	would you wanna move there and be?
A	no I think if I went to
B	this is where my geography doesn't come into er
A	so where my parents live it's about by train it's about like an hour and a hour from
B	okay
A	so it's not actually that bad like I could commute it especially if I was only on campus two days a week
B	yeah
A	and the only issue is now my mother's been made redundant
A	erm the school she worked at got overtaken by an academy and so therefore money is important and therefore they have literally made I think about twenty people redundant mostly admin staff erm er so I don't know where they're what they're gonna be doing anymore like mum like dad still he
B	yeah
A	job and he his job and his salary is good enough to support them
B	okay
A	but mum can't just sit at home all day
B	that's the thing like how is your mum feeling like?
A	erm she I think she's actually okay with it I mean she's not
B	yeah?
A	doing too badly
B	I suppose if it's like I know it sounds awful but if it's a group of people if it's
A	mm
B	gonna be made redundant it doesn't make it any easier but it does make you feel like it wasn't just you know
A	you yeah
B	cos I think the weird thing you know at
A	yeah
A	how is everything with
B	mm
A	so like
B	I think it's better than it was but from my department but there's been a restructure where editor and
A	god
A	yeah I saw that
B	so yeah so
A	so maybe she's still doing the same editorial role basically?
B	oh yeah they just don't call it that
A	they just call it something different yeah
B	exactly so it's kind of like well it's like product management which has some weight in other industries
A	yeah
B	that
A	who? oh
B	cos it's just been real they've just got all the pressure on them at the moment over this
A	god
B	you know yeah but erm I think
A	yeah
B	but erm like marketing is better now that the restructure has actually been announced it's a bit
A	well the thing is they started restructuring when I was there
B	when we were
A	like
B	and er it was basically it was on my birthday my first year right? so we'd not even been there a year it was my birthday it was July that they first announced the restructure
A	yeah it feels like they've been restructuring for years
B	yeah and I mean yeah okay transformation takes time but I think there is I think just it's better in marketing than it was but it's quite dependent they've got quite a lot of more senior roles going at the moment but like
A	so
B	oh yeah everyone's going for the same job
A	shit that's a bit dangerous isn't it?
B	but they've been doing that all the time like
A	oh okay
B	so
A	yeah can imagine if like especially like people like
B	yeah well obviously I mean like everybody's kind of like yeah same old same old
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I loved the job that I was doing before with science in terms of the people that I was working with
A	yeah
B	that was awesome the kind of work that we were being asked to do was just like
A	no
A	ah
B	you know
A	ah
B	like
A	ah
B	but you know I think that's the thing if I'd had a job where I was working with people I think I'd be alright like
A	so are you not working with people? are you just?
B	yeah I'm working with people but it's more like I know that
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I really like but it's kind of like well yeah what jobs let you do? cos it is that standard thing where they're not gonna like oh
A	yeah
B	and it's I'm still kind of weighing up but it's difficult cos it's like if I had I dunno if my family were closer or if I was living with
A	yeah
B	as in any of the choices that I made I would choose to do a less demanding job
A	yeah
B	because I don't want there to be an effect you know I don't want to be impacted but at the moment when it's just not just me but when it's pretty much confined to me and
A	yeah
B	my lovely friend that
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it's like I'm not ready to make those kind of choices yet
A	no no
B	so I just need to like see what I can do and see what's possible not on full hours yet at all I'm on seven
A	what hours are you doing?
B	seven
A	seven
B	so I'm nearly there
A	oh so you're nearly back up
B	but I am finding it quite hard now like before I went to
A	yeah
B	it's all about getting the balance isn't it?
A	oh yeah definitely
A	you need a work life balance
B	and it's not even work anymore it's just like it's like oh I'm tired
A	you haven't been able to go to the gym? god
B	I've not been allowed to go cos
A	yeah
B	on top of doing work yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm just like I just like but I ended up doing so much walking in Dublin like
A	yeah so things did work out for you
B	it's like it's like Berlin and like and it's like Berlin and it's kind of like we just ended up walking
A	yeah
B	we didn't deliberately go out to do masses of walking we just did
A	same with Barcelona we did just
B	yeah
A	we did so much walking in Barcelona
B	did you? I was gonna ask about the big Barcelona episode but I was like
B	or is it just the ones that you have on Facebook? cos
A	it's
B	they were lovely
A	it was you've yeah you went to Barcelona didn't you?
B	awesome it's such a cool place
A	very beautiful place
B	no
A	yeah you get endorphins
B	it's like we were saying too it's like I was saying to you like earlier but it was that the mind set
A	yeah seeing friends saps your
B	can drain energy
A	yeah yeah
B	but seeing them being normal and being like happy and having a great time
A	yeah
B	it's giving you an energy boost
A	yeah yeah
B	so it's that kind of and it's that kind of thing where I was like you know like you and
A	good yeah
B	I can do this I just need to
A	oh it's fine
B	I was just like
A	I'm old I don't go out very much
B	dude like I'll just chill I'll just chill and listen to cheesy music and do what we do
A	exactly I don't do
B	and it was like
A	I don't go out very much
B	and it's a bit like just whatever you do please don't make me go into a situation where I have to meet all your lovely friends cos I'm like if I'm tired
A	oh my god no
B	if I'm tired by then I was like I've got to meet some of them
A	maybe
B	yeah
A	it's and
B	is she? has she gone back for a bit?
A	well she's gone back for a wedding
B	mm
A	but it was her it's her birthday this Wednesday
B	mm
A	so on the Friday night I arranged a meal for her at
B	lovely yeah it's really nice there
A	and they have like a pre seven o'clock eleven
B	yeah
A	ninety meal so
B	it's
A	yeah so she was like erm it was a surprise for her and
B	mm
A	like like the whole week she would be like
B	oh bless her
A	bring loads of snacks like

A	yeah so I turned up at erm twenty to six and she was like there she opened the door and she goes hi I'm like you're in your gym clothes aren't you? she was like yeah sorry I haven't showered yet I smell I'm like no no no I'm more worried that you have twenty minutes to get ready and she's like what? I was like we're going out
A	so I drove her into town and she's like where are we going? why are we going into a carpark? I was like
B	ah
A	mm and then
A	and then and then I
B	yeah
A	and she was like now you know there's no surprises are there? there's no more surprises? I like no don't worry that's it and then we woke up on Saturday morning and went into her bedroom at nine o'clock and I was like you have an hour to get ready before we go to the train station and she was like oh my god what have you done? so we took her to London to see The Book of Mormon
B	ah
A	and she didn't know and she was like we're going to London why are we going to London what's happening?

B	she must have loved it
A	she did she really liked it like I I've wanted to see The Book of Mormon for ages
B	yeah
B	is it good?
A	so politically incorrect if you have like a high moral sense of humour you will not like it
A	if you're
B	I was looking at it cos they had like er a load of like last minute dot com like theatre deals
A	yeah
B	like they had a whole like fortnight of it
