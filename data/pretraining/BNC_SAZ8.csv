A	what kind of things are you doing in linguistics study?
B	just general ELT style stuff really
A	so is it searching out seeing what kind of words people use? Or how they use words or?
B	how they well yeah how how you use words or kind of grammatical constructions that actually still used rather than just taught in grammar lessons and
A	okay
B	that sort of thing
A	mm
B	yep
B	oh the OED allows them now so
A	mm
B	must be
A	mm
B	I have got more ideas than that
A	I guess we need to think about whether we want to do it on a friend or foe
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	that there are
B	yeah that's that's a good point cos I hadn't thought about that
A	mm
B	I don't know what to do
A	go on
B	I think it's one way to live one way to die
A	yeah
B	so I don't know
A	I guess it's two ways to live at the moment isn't it
B	mhm
A	mm
B	talk time
A	it was shorter than my one I think
B	yeah well yours was recap
A	yeah that's true
B	okay
A	um
B	it's just then though we've got the flowers to do and the
A	mm
B	we're not actually gonna have that much time
A	so we've got snacks
B	yes
A	and then go into small groups and pray and share prayer and share
B	and can get over the whole discussion of what colour you like first
A	I should just do like come in on one Friday and just make ten more sets
B	um so er er oh brain
A	think that's too short? I think if we have more than twenty-five minutes that bit's getting quite
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	er
A	Cos the boys were quite quick
B	mhm
A	yeah
B	that's a challenge
unknown_female	hiya
B	hi
A	it takes quite a long time to make the flowers
B	how many are they making? Er for the morning both morning services?
A	I assume so
B	I think we need to end on a good game
A	yeah
B	otherwise they'll think why did we bother
A	we could have do the flowers and then do a very quick game
B	mm
A	if we don't finish praying till then but
B	mm
A	what we could do though is we could if we pray quite quickly and then set up the flowers
B	yeah
A	in the flowers
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so in that case we don't need  we don't need  a intro game
A	no
B	uh-huh
A	um
A	or something
B	oh you mean that even if they aren't gonna get a choice whether they rebel?
A	well they could can't they
B	I just just completely forget what I'm supposed to be doing normally
A	yeah
B	but no I like it
A	but that's kind of on theme
B	mhm
A	and it's kinda short and long
B	mhm
A	um
B	Cos you you know you can  you can  make that as elaborate as or as simple as you like
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um
B	live this way or live that way
A	yeah
B	only cos my
A	mm
B	um put around the room various um I don't know like superheroes
A	mhm
B	or whatever and their nemeses and their sidekicks
B	whether it's a pair or not
A	but you could do that as the quiet game
B	mm
A	you could have pictures and facts on bits of paper and they've got to match them up
B	mhm
A	and you can match them all up
B	that would  that would  be nice and quiet
A	would be nice and quiet and it'd be quite fun
B	A bit woolly
B	er
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	they were nice last year
A	cellophane thing
B	mm
A	I think we should allow half an hour
B	er yeah but there's it's all movable
A	yeah
B	I just
A	it's just good starting off with it
B	noisy big game
A	so the other ideas I had
B	mhm
A	because that's kind of friend or foe like
A	I haven't worked out how exactly that would work
B	I'd love to see them burrowing through people's legs
A	together?
B	yeah
A	it could be a game
B	getting very friendly
A	you can  you can  get people yeah exactly
B	uh-huh
A	all kinds of things
B	how you seen that work? What?
A	well no I just
B	mhm
A	again that's something we could do which doesn't take much prep
B	yeah
A	hello
unknown_female	oh
B	very early
A	yeah
unknown_female	oh
A	we've come to eat the Mini Rolls and flapjacks actually
unknown_female	ah
B	hm
unknown_female	you don't have another key? My key's at Tesco being recut
A	I don't have a key for that one I'm afraid
unknown_female	no
A	sadly
unknown_female	yes
A	it would be very useful
unknown_female	I know
A	but I don't
unknown_female	well
A	there's probably a key in the filing cabinet where the spare keys are kept
unknown_female	true
A	yeah
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	are you doing your Pathfinder planning?
A	yeah
B	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	um
A	this was before I got to my choices thing
unknown_female	see you soon
A	all the teams
B	see you
unknown_female	bye
A	um
B	what is our memory verse?
A	it's um
A	it's about something like um tut
B	mhm
A	mm
B	mm
A	so they don't know which
B	so you could have them set up at the either side of the room
A	yeah
B	no just thinking out now
A	yeah
B	so would they huh would this have to come before
B	question of the week?
A	um
B	I was just thinking if they were doing hangman
A	yes but you see there's quite there's er you know it just means that actually cos you here once you have E get all the Es
B	ah and there's a lot of Os
A	and there's a lot of Os
B	uh-huh
A	it has Js and Vs and Bs
B	mhm
A	then even if they started with those
B	I like it
A	but if we're doing it before the question of the week that probably means it doesn't
B	how yeah we need to make it so would they have something to do in their groups in order
A	yeah
B	and they in which case it would need to be quite snappy
A	yeah
B	they definitely need to run
A	they definitely need to run
B	um
A	um so realistically how many might we have? How many teams might we need to have? Maximum four teams
B	it's normally three
A	I mean you could have one lot in the cr√©che um with the doors open but so that the words kind of
B	yeah
A	um with one curtain closed
B	mhm
A	is that enough running?
B	so they start from there
A	but we could introduce a bit more running by them running to get the place where you get letters from and then going back again
B	oh
A	is what I was thinking
B	uh-huh
A	um but it's not very far for them to run but it's some distance for them to run
B	mhm
A	just one
B	uh-huh
A	um which somehow they've got to do without the others seeing
B	do you this is
B	just to introduce a bit of choice
A	yes
B	could they do something where if they they can either come and ask for for a letter
A	yes
B	or they can ask for a riddle or a challenge or something and if they
A	oo
B	so the they can take the time and speed things up perhaps depending on their ability
A	or if they get the question right they get two letters
B	no but they have to cotton onto that
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	um
B	no and running twenty-six times back and forth is not going to take too long anyway
A	no
B	right should we
A	should we just scrap that instead of Simon Says and do Simon Says?
B	and then memory verse
A	okay
B	or two fun games
A	two fun games
B	we haven't played dwarfs giants thingies for a while
A	no
B	that's true
B	maybe we
A	I just realized that
B	but
A	maybe it's epistemologically too tight
B	mm
A	um
B	hm
A	maybe we should just do giants wizards and dwarfs because it
B	mhm
A	yeah
B	um
A	and basically they're always foe unless they are the same
B	yes
A	is that right?
B	yes
A	Cos they're friends
B	yep
A	what happens if you have three teams?
B	that could be qiute fun
A	okay
B	it could be chaos
A	let's just think whether or not that will actually work logistically
B	the basic principle is just run
A	run
B	mm
A	I think it'll take too long won't it
B	long
A	hello
unknown_female	hiya
A	yeah I think you're right
B	I am rubbish tonight
B	it's not really a running around game
A	mhm
B	but I just wondered about something where they had um they had to basically sort themselves out into teams um by a sort of twenty questions sort of scenario where they wander round
A	hm
B	who they're with
A	mm
B	or for the choices thing something where
A	I thought about battleships cos I heard quite recently where if you go where you could have friendly fire somehow
A	enemy fire and friendly fire with
B	or Mafia
A	or Mafia
B	oh let's play Mafia
A	okay
B	er how long is a piece of string?
A	Great
B	mhm
A	Cos it's a sitting down game isn't it
B	yeah
A	but it's fun
B	it'll also depend on their age
A	okay
A	if we need to
B	that's true
A	I'll put that back up
B	mm
A	excellent
B	mhm
A	Cos I don't know how to do that
B	cool
A	um
B	mhm
A	and
B	excellent
A	Great
B	and a final question
A	oh I'd love you to cook
A	I think it's meant to be my turn but I would love that
B	okay
A	or this  or this  week even
B	er how many people should I prepare for?
A	mm
B	mhm
A	and have smaller portions if need be
B	okay
A	but it's like ten normal portions
B	cook more carbs
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	is that alright?
B	mhm
B	I like having two weeks' notice
A	yeah exactly you've got it means you've got a good amount of weekend to do it in
B	well I haven't but
A	okay
B	I can do it next week
A	okay
B	yep
A	that's wonderful
B	mm
