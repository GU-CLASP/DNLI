A	american society
B	yes no it was um
B	mm
A	the countryside versus rich cities
B	yep
A	and the whole sort of the er the sort of states versus federal government
B	mhm
B	yeah
A	um
B	and I quite like the idea of taking sort of Jerry Springer like a step too far
A	oh yes it did
B	the idea of entertainment sort of yeah
A	suffering
B	suffering
A	well that I mean that's nothing new
B	yep
A	they've done shows er they've done films and television programmes based on taking reality TV too far
B	oh yeah
A	before
B	I don't think that was the main point but it did sort of made me think of that actually that bit which was
A	yeah indeed
A	oh police cars
A	waiting for
A	that would be really funny if the
A	sorry can't get out
A	um that was yes
B	yeah it was um
A	well I think the idea
B	or
A	of being which was only mentioned very briefly that you can trade sort of increased odds for food
B	right
A	um
B	which was presumably why that guy had so many?
A	yes
B	I didn't know if it was a kind of punishment
A	no I think it was
B	yeah yeah I think it's supposed to be buying them
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	all that kind of idea and the sort of um playing the media
A	er yes er
A	um
B	she'd have been fine
A	I've no idea
B	yeah
A	um but it
B	I I was just like as I was watching it I I wasn't sure whether it was gonna be kind of say three films for for the whole story or whether they were gonna stop halfway through the game
A	well no that would've
B	doing that cos that would've been yeah
A	far too
B	exactly
A	um
B	er and then I didn't know if it was different people each time and just a sort of different storyline
A	yeah
B	so I assume it's gonna be the same people
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	as a sort of
A	mm
B	yeah
B	just a to keep  to keep  sort of milking that one
A	yeah
B	you know sort of play with it
A	what was I gonna say? Um
B	mm
A	well no but there's obvious reasons for it
B	mm
A	then that means you have good odds of surviving the first half
B	and then you
A	which you then split split up again
B	mm
A	um but
B	it relies on other people playing fair though
A	well indeed you have to
B	someone could gather all the strong people to then kill them all
A	well it would be inherently quite difficult to kill them
B	but then that's the hard bit
B	mm
A	killing her
B	killing her herself cos everyone else was doing it
A	I think that's quite predictable
B	yeah
A	but I assumed that the friend was gonna be killed
B	yeah
A	it was a surprisingly yeah that was a very sort of yeah this is a book for sort of children as in this is that was a very positive ending to it
B	yes exactly
A	um similar strong female lead
B	yeah
A	and um two potential male love interests
B	yeah
A	er
B	who look like they would actually murder each other
A	well no but who
B	one gets a bit hairy at night
A	yeah
B	one's a bit pale
A	no she's finally a vampire now
B	I love that we're the same temperature
B	know what I mean
A	yes we've got markedly different thermal capacities
A	so therefore we contain different amounts of stored energy
B	yeah
B	oh my goodness
A	it was a bit unfortunate
B	I dunno
B	oh hilarious
B	yeah you no not in a cinema
B	yeah um apart from being quite Twightlighty it was good
A	yeah indeed it was
B	as in it wasn't all er while they had that element of it it wasn't all moony and kind of oh I love you
A	no it was very good
B	it was  it was  kind of and I mean is the interesting thing is as well that she's was she playing it? Was she doing it to survive? And what's gonna happen cos
A	no I don't think so because if she was doing it to survive she would have killed him at the end
B	no but I mean she could
A	no but she
B	yeah
B	she she could've not wanted him to die but she I mean she might not be in love with him
A	well no but that's quite a step to
B	no
A	I think you might be overthinking this a bit
B	I dunno
A	yes but no but she knew that she was going to survive even she knew she had better odds of survival if she didn't do that
B	I dunno
A	I think you're just
B	okay
A	completely taking that the wrong way
B	okay
A	it'd be far too boring if she wasn't
B	fair enough
A	no as in
B	no but I'm saying she maybe wasn't doing it just to survive
A	well then
B	and thought well I don't want this game to be like you know cos they said at the beginning um that if they could do something
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	to make a stand
A	I know
B	no but I'm saying maybe she wasn't willing to die to not let the games win
A	yeah possibly
B	do it like that's the
A	probably not because she was very keen to get home to her sister
B	but I
B	I just wasn't convinced
A	well that's probably the acting
B	well yeah possibly
A	or the scripting
B	it was possibly just like yeah possibly slighty kinda
A	or the fact that you're not a teenager
B	maybe
A	in natality at least
A	no idea
B	mm
A	well I yeah cos I got that free sample of the first book in with the DVD awards thing
B	oh yes
B	was it
A	it seemed to be
B	yeah
A	yes
B	but I mean there's I used to read stuff like not maybe not stuff quite as dark as that but I used to read sort of teen fantasy type stuff quite a lot
B	but of course in a book you can  you can  er you can really either play it up make it quite graphic or you can play it down and just have them dying
A	well that was really played down
B	yep
B	yeah
A	what cos teenagers are quite horrible?
B	yeah
A	I find it difficult handling that idea
B	no but as in like
A	the people particularly it's particularly disturbing in the opening sequences as in people you were training you were
B	mm
A	sort of you know trying to kill like it's
B	yeah
A	your enemy becomes a uniform target
B	yes
A	in this particular case you know you get to know people you are going to try to kill
B	yeah that was what I found
A	it would impair
B	yeah
A	your ability to kill them
B	exactly
A	targets
B	yeah
A	yep
B	Cos yeah I just wouldn't be talking to
A	ah that leads me
B	but
A	to the next question
B	I think I would've been very quickly killed
B	oh yes
A	um
B	what were we saying?
A	the other thing you were saying was
B	oh yeah how how would I cope?
A	yeah
B	well I dunno
A	mm
B	yeah
A	that may have actually worked pretty well
B	yeah
A	well it would be difficult to search an area that large
B	yeah
A	definitely yeah
B	but would they have
A	you'd last for a few days
B	exactly
A	over a week without food
B	um but of course would they let you
A	this is true
B	which is the problem with any strategy
A	but
B	though they can
A	but I assumed that they'd leave it in as fair and I was surprised that they interfered because they'd think that would be unpopular
B	yeah yeah
A	mind you of course they're trying to make it interesting so it's just like reality TV
B	yeah exactly
B	sort of fiddling with it
A	er
B	yes
A	yes
B	mm
A	don't want to let your enemy come to you
B	well while she was up in the tree could she not have shot them?
A	yeah but she didn't have an arrow
B	oh she didn't have a bow and arrow at that point did she
A	no no that's right
B	yeah she really should've taken more opportunities
A	what guy? This was
B	um so when the they left the stuff all piled up and there was one guy left on guard
A	yes
B	she should've killed him
A	oh er
B	she
A	no
B	but yeah
A	er to take it to another extreme
B	mm
A	to help you
B	yeah
A	um so but leaving that aside I mean basic things so er the girl who died
B	yeah
A	food
B	well yeah indeed
A	yeah
B	but again that gesture may be made unpopular
A	you well it wouldn't have occurred to her but then that's why she's not
B	mm
B	mm
A	you should be
B	yeah
A	prepared to take advantage
B	in all fairness I mean the
A	no but no they wouldn't
B	mm
A	then that wouldn't that count in your favour
B	yeah
A	because that makes it entertaining
B	yeah
A	and unpredictable
B	yeah
A	that's why Out of the Question always worked well cos it's always not
B	yeah
A	or at least if it is it's
B	yeah
A	they are who you
B	so obvious
A	expect it to be
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	I speak sense
A	now I'm a little bit concerned about going back on the
B	oh okay
A	we'll see
B	mm
A	sorry?
B	I guess
A	yes
A	yes
A	ah
B	ah
A	anyway
B	yeah anyway
A	so how do you think I would've done?
B	I think you'd have won
A	it's er yeah
B	of survival plus strength
A	hunting
B	plus hunting
A	I'd have wanted a rifle
B	I don't think that's the idea
A	there's a
B	yeah
A	A handgun would've done
B	yep
A	er
B	mm
A	you never saw a gun out of the entire film
B	no
B	that's what I was just what I was thinking it was all bows and arrows and swords
A	no but even the enforcers didn't seem to have firearms
B	no
A	which I found kind of funny
B	yeah
A	I mean again there were a few other factors so I wouldn't I'm just thinking about them showing
B	mm
A	I would've if I'd been her I'd have cut my hair off very quickly
B	yep
A	um potentially used it as a bow string
B	yeah
A	um
B	it was interesting er I mean one thing that did irked me a little bit was that amazingly blended in rock thing
A	well if a rock was covered in a particular material it wouldn't be that difficult to
B	mm
A	oh shush
A	yes
B	right
A	so even if he was wounded that could've worked quite well
B	yeah
B	mm
A	anyway
B	yeah um
A	but needless to say
A	it wasn't me
B	no
A	well no but I
A	wouldn't want to end up killing children
B	fair enough
A	but that's the thing
B	yeah
A	actually hold on a second
B	no I know what you mean
A	this is quite sick
B	that's that's the thing with children
A	and that's why there's I think that works with children who are young enough not to think about what it actually means
B	but having said that though teenagers are quite capable of thinking about that kind of thing
A	no they're not
B	yeah
A	you're fighting to you know often for a country or to
B	yeah an ideology or
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	and there's something driving you
B	yeah
A	but here er you are killing in order to just to survive
B	yeah not
A	yep
B	I guess the I mean the idea is that it it kind of forces you to become an animal
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	and
B	and I guess that's
A	no but but er I don't think unless you really make an active effort to put yourself in their shoes I don't I think it would be very easy to gloss over that film
B	mm
A	understood it
B	but
A	and
B	but I mean that's okay like
A	yeah but I'm not sure it's okay to I'm still not sure if it's an appropriate film for a appropriate film for that age range
B	really?
A	yeah
B	no but you could say that so you could say okay so Pirates of the Caribbean
A	no but not like
B	mm
A	um it's not just a setting and it's yeah disturbed
B	also a bit like Noughts and Crosses
A	sorry?
B	um have you do do you know Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman?
A	no
B	um well it's a series of books
A	right
B	um and that's
A	oh I see what they did there with the noughts
A	yes but it's one thing to have people being killed
B	mm
A	and I think the fact that it was clean
B	yeah
B	ah it's probably your mum
A	are you sure? Right well I'll wait till we get there
B	yeah yeah sure
A	well we haven't got back
B	no exactly
A	that's entirely accurate
A	as soon as we get up to speed you can um pass me the phone
B	it's probably a voicemail
A	well whatever
B	yeah
A	no listen to it and then delete it
B	it said voice mailbox number
A	yeah should be
B	oh wow
A	okay
B	yeah it's it's not your mum
A	okay
B	one missed call
A	oh alright
B	do you wanna just leave it or?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	um
B	ah
A	so yes er film
B	yeah
A	yeah so
B	Good
A	that was fine just fine
B	mm
A	for far more sort of it was a brilliant concept for er could of been taken a lot further
B	mm
A	but in some ways
B	but that would be an entirely different book
A	yeah but it wasn't as in
B	but
A	like I said fundamentally disturbing thing was the concept
B	yeah
A	and the fact they chose not to go into that and to make it very simplistic didn't remove that threat or that menace
B	hm
A	the fact most people wouldn't be aware of
B	but yeah I mean you could've done that
A	well no it's the same story
B	mm
A	it's not
B	it's it's it's about markets
A	but that's the point
B	the teenage market
A	it isn't like that
B	possibly
A	I know and I understand what you're saying
B	actually
A	but it should I'm saying it shouldn't have been
B	no
A	because in reality I think it was actually virtually
A	no less disturbing like that
B	mm
A	but and therefore I don't know that it was really appropriate for that audience
B	I think twelve-year-olds are fine
A	no er you see I
B	I mean I say twelve-year-olds
A	but you see but
B	like fifteen-year-olds they could
A	yeah but okay so
B	er like sixteen-year-olds be seeing that as well
A	sh sh sh shut up for a minute
B	mm
A	as an adult who actually thinks about it in more depth than because when I was a child I just sort of glossed over
B	yeah
A	you start thinking actually you know in this scene you know ten people just got killed
B	yeah
A	and actually that's really disturbing and tragic
B	mm
A	but certainly for me if I'd watched that film when I was fifteen or I dunno twelve I would've found it much less odd than I do now
B	mm
A	and hence yet again like I said to you um they rely on the naivety of the audience to protect them from being disturbed
B	well that's a bit odd but aren't you also just presenting young minds with a very difficult situation to think about? Which surely is the point of the book to to give you something to think about? And I think that's quite a good thing to be thinking about
A	well I do
B	okay
A	I dunno
B	but that image struck with me and it I thought about it and it I grew up and thought about it
A	yes and all of what you're saying is completely true
B	mm
A	but
B	okay
A	very strange
B	okay well I mean think about the film Matilda
A	again
B	so
A	it's a far less disturbing concept
B	okay
A	yes I enjoyed it
A	tremendously
B	Good
A	just marred
A	I'd have said you shouldn't have it was brilliant
B	mm
A	yes well I think that's
B	well it's like Borat um not Borat um Bruno
A	why not?
A	mm
B	yeah do things
A	well to be fair it was very formulatic formulaic
B	yeah
A	and
B	and you can stick to it
A	mm some of it might be but yeah
B	mm
A	the boxes aren't subjective but the things that you are choosing for the boxes are
B	mm
B	I think that's a really fascinating topic actually
A	yes
B	and
A	mm
B	to mark the hundred years of it
A	well they were rating silent films
B	er nineteen twelve first talkie I believe was nineteen twelve
A	fuck
B	so where's he going?
A	mm
B	er yeah
A	about that
B	about ten years ago
B	so it's a very old sign
A	mm
B	I'm
A	no it's sensible except when you pointed out you know it made it very difficult for people with kids
B	mm
A	they didn't want to see the PGs
B	yeah
A	but
A	oh well
B	er
A	take that non-intuitive speed limit
A	just killing the beams because as we go over the hill
B	yeah
A	if we approach that
B	mhm
A	mm
B	so it's you know it's a bit violent but not horrendously so
A	yeah
B	um with Arnold Schwarzenegger
A	well all
B	well yeah true
A	yeah
B	I think even at the time
A	you see the first Lord of the Rings I can't believe that's a PG
B	yeah
A	that film disturbed me
B	first Lord of the Rings? I don't think you were that old cos I wasn't fifteen
A	er in that ballpark anyway
B	well I saw all of them before sixth form
A	I I don't actually care
B	okay
A	but it it
B	presumably it stayed
A	scared me
B	oh no it was very scary
A	the first one was by far the scariest
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I thought was so strong in the first one
A	mm
B	but
A	sort of the idea er theme er split personality Golem
B	yeah
A	very strange
B	but that's the second film though
A	er
B	you er
B	but you don't really see Golem though
A	yeah yeah
B	until the second film
B	yeah I mean that's that's pretty bad yeah
A	what are we gonna do about food?
B	um do you wanna go and I mean
A	three quarters of an hour
B	mm
A	sorry?
B	it's pretty close
A	what are you talking about? Oh the cinema
B	the
A	it's only of the order of twice the time to get to
B	mm
A	slightly more but
B	yeah I mean
A	and of course there is no traffic at this time of night
B	no
B	yeah
A	particularly if one wasn't too bothered about speed limits
A	um
A	oh we could park on
B	oh
A	the double yellow lines outside
A	living dangerously
B	might be a policeman hiding somewhere
A	er I was gonna say the police will have nothing better to do tonight
B	yeah
A	so
B	no
A	um
B	did yeah do you wanna go and see if that's open?
A	er
B	domino's is probably midnight
A	do you know we could just park outside Domino's
B	yeah and walk up
A	um
A	I might like a bit of something savoury
B	yeah
A	actually yeah
B	I I wouldn't mind something to eat
A	mm
B	if you want
A	not very appetizing
A	I wouldn't
B	pff
A	could you possibly signal?
B	wow
A	that's just
A	it's just
B	is just insane
A	I wish when it was blatantly obvious what you were doing
A	Christ
A	yeah well I'd beat myself up if I realized that I'd missed a signal that would've been marginally beneficial to someone
A	well let's not make it sound like it was tailgating him
B	no no but I mean er you were blatantly there
A	but might not of
B	he might not yeah he maybe he was just signalling out of habit at the point he normally signals
A	there was literally zero point in that signal
B	no
A	er so what looks open?
B	okay
A	domino's?
B	domino's looks like it could well be open
A	I'd be surprised if they are shut
B	what Fish and Chicken?
A	maximum stay four hours
B	probably manage yeah
A	right
