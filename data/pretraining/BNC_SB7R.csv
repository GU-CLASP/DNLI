A	oh okay
B	so I facetimed her and she answered
A	when was that
A	was she going out? cos I phoned her at the equivalent of about quarter past nine in the morning and I think it was the same night
B	on
A	oh maybe it was the day before then
B	they'd got up really early to go and watch the sun rise cos it's thirty degrees out there at the moment
A	oh wow
B	and she said
A	I bet it was the day before then
B	they got up really early to to go and watch the sun rise and I think she was just awake early again cos of course it's night isn't it?
A	mm
B	so I spoke to her briefly then and yeah the
A	yeah
B	like that there was a carrier bag but it was shredded
B	there's that leak at the back? that was shredded and I thought
A	oh
B	what would you think?
A	a a mouse
B	a mouse that's what I thought and like inside the the are you dribbling again? inside the bag of
A	oh
B	she's got the seed oh he's all dribbly let's
A	there's muslins there
B	oh there it is inside the bag of seed
A	yeah
B	you know
A	put a clean bib on him
B	the seed she's got well I think so
A	yeah go on then
B	the seed that she's using is in a Tupperware but then er after that she's got a big bag that's just in a carrier bag and I think it was that anyway there were no mouse droppings but there was there was shredded bits of carrier bag inside the bag of seed
A	oh really? oh it's all wet there
B	no he's not too bad I just felt under his chin you put this on in case you keep dribbling little man? mm? yeah so I did tell her I wasn't gonna tell her
A	yeah
B	but I was talking to her on the facetime that day
A	there
B	and erm
A	and so you said yeah
B	so I said oh it's just but she said oh it's not that cos you know she'd seen that rat outside her house?
A	oh yes oh yes
B	I said it's not mum I said it er I said and also in that cupboard you've got a whole stack of paper
A	yeah
B	none of that was shredded you've got a whole thing of toilet roll all that was intact
A	so what what was?
B	and said I can't quite decide it
A	mm
B	was almost like maybe a mouse had come maybe it thought oh seed's not for me and and hadn't bothered but
B	but I went back today with a tin
A	batteries are going on that
B	oh yeah they are are I went with a tin to put the bag of seed in so it can't get into the tin
A	oh okay
B	so there's a Tupperware there's a tin and I've swept it all up and there again there were no mouse droppings and it didn't look any different to how it had looked
A	oh alright then
B	on Thursday so I think she's okay
A	it's alright
B	but I just
A	never solved the mystery of the er missing Christmas cards then?
B	er no
A	who won't have?
A	well where's she put them then?

A	you
B	no you wouldn't I don't know

B	but
B	how old was he?
A	dunno oh he was well into his eighties
B	was he?
A	erm must have been I mean
B	oh oh he must be
A	shall we turn
B	what?
A	this turtle off
B	he is we all will be much more of that oh there we go yeah is that better? oh well that was his
A	it's funny he's losing his batteries isn't he?
B	what about this one? look
A	he's losing his batteries
B	what about this?
A	he's got little scratch mitts anyway now he just lost them I think I left a couple
A	in your coat over here shall we have a look?
B	does he
A	no well
B	and he's not wearing them
A	she cut his nails in the day so I've left them off him today well I I
B	oh okay
B	oh look
A	that's why we we were struggling to put your coat on weren't we? cos you were
B	when your mum gets home what do you think she's gonna make of nanny eh? do you think she's done a good job? or is mummy gonna say?
A	well as long as you're happy and smiling look we've got three scratch mitts here so that's an odd number then we've got one that doesn't match anything and then we've got two blue ones so I don't know what we've done with it
B	is he still sleeping well at night?
A	oh here's another white one erm yes cos she's she's keeping him awake more in the day and he's done ever so well today and he hasn't been asleep at all hardly
B	well this is the problem though cos it's only half past three he'll probably fall asleep at like five o'clock and then he won't go to sleep
A	she lets him have an hour then and that's it
B	oh does she?
A	yeah and wakes him up
B	then and then wakes him up
A	and then she's does him his bath and but he's going down at about eight o'clock in the evening
B	oh brilliant
A	but he sleeps till about four four thirty
B	right
A	but she was keeping him awake till sort of ten
B	oh
A	and then two and then
B	so she they may as well have a bit of an evening if they
A	yeah
B	just have a couple of hours
A	so she's doing eight o'clock now and she says he's absolutely shattered by the time it comes to his bath and that and he's falls asleep
B	ah
A	on his bottle and he stays asleep till
B	four?
A	yeah but she's not
B	oh it's a
A	I don't think she she does feed him then yes yeah cos he started waking up in the night and so she was just trying to water and
B	and do they still?
A	dummy and
B	is it still six months before you're supposed to put them on solids cos it changed didn't it?
A	they say that but I don't think she's gonna leave him that long she was in the erm clinic the other day I think probably the weighing clinic and er
B	oh
A	there we go again
B	oh shall we sit you up? what is going on with that milk?
B	it is whoops
A	and there was erm there
B	have you got a bit of wind? shall

B	yeah
A	cos he's I said he's working that was yesterday and then we're out for that meal
B	okay yeah
A	I said and then he's working today and he's supposed to be finishing decorating my bedroom and he's painting it cos I'm
B	oh he said you were doing that yes yeah
A	erm so and he's just to paint that for me
B	my bedroom
A	our bedroom
A	yeah paint my bedroom for me well he has a small area
A	I've started with my en-suite cos I'm the only one that uses the en-suite and that's the bit he's doing at the moment
B	is nanny mean to your pops? is nanny mean to your pops?
A	he's he re-grouted he started by re-grouting the shower which wasn't really on my list of things to do but he said oh I'll re-grout that I says oh we
B	oh
A	thank you
B	need ours re-grouting
A	yeah well don't ask my husband I said erm
B	oh
A	okay well that's it looks nice thank you I said presumably you want me to leave it for a few days before I have a shower no no he said it dries in two or three hours so
B	oh wow
A	so the following day I went in and all the
B	oh
A	no
A	no of course he doesn't
A	so he read the thing again and it it said it did say two to three hours
B	oh
A	but then a bit further if using in a shower allow twenty-four
B	well
A	hours
B	what as opposed to a bath? where it doesn't actually maybe get wet around the top
A	okay so I said alright then
B	maybe yeah
A	so he grouted again and then I used the shower in the bathroom
B	yeah
A	and then another day on it said yeah yeah it'll fine to use so I used it and all the grouting came out
B	oh no
A	and I've used it every day since and all it's done is is grout going everywhere he says oh it doesn't really matter because it's quite old I could get some more grout I says why are you even bothering? why don't you just get on with the job I asked to do which was repaint?
A	can we just leave the grouting alone now? so I just come out covered in grout
B	oh no
B	well that's good exfoliation I expect
A	oh
B	rub it all over your body
A	it's crazy cos it's this chunky
B	yeah good exfoliation coming out the wall yes
A	so er yeah
A	so if you need anything re-grouting I I wouldn't ask my husband
A	he's gonna put a new wooden floor down in there for me and then got a blind to fit and he's painting
B	oh okay
A	but he was gonna paint
B	why doesn't he use that one then?
A	the bedroom he never has it's always been mine
B	oh
A	cos it's full of my stuff and it's nice
B	oh
A	it's so nice
B	oh
A	I would never go back to sharing a bathroom with him
B	oh
A	oh no
A	it's nice to have your own isn't it?
B	well I suppose so
A	your own toilet nobody else uses it
B	yeah I suppose so
A	he cleans it all for me
B	oh well there we go then
A	doesn't go in it
B	he's a saint isn't he?
A	and they've got the other one haven't they er all and then
B	oh
A	don't you even and she just laughed at me and she goes oh it's so easy to get to you
A	yours and
B	ah
A	oh she said I'm not sure if you're allowed in there to use our shower
B	does she let her dad use her shower?
A	I think he goes in the bath at about midnight when nobody's around and he only puts half an inch of water in
B	ah
A	he uses his bar of soap to wash his hair and everything
B	poor old grandad eh
A	oh I must erm check the time of the flight because
B	oh er I'd love to do erm
A	you get at taxi or
B	no we're gonna park
A	oh yes of course you are cos it wasn't much was it?
B	it wasn't much it was
A	yes
A	I know
B	mm mind you but
A	is he?
B	for yes
A	yeah
B	so they've booked him a flight and airport parking and his airport parking is fifty something quid I said
A	oh ridiculous
B	we're going for a week in half term and Meet and Greet's less than that
A	yeah
B	I dunno what they've booked for you
B	so if it's right on the doorstep
B	er yes
A	they've just booked the most expensive
B	I know ridiculous anyway
A	they've
B	probably
A	or something stupid like that
B	so he's going he's he's gotta be up at five gotta be at the airport at six or something stupid
A	right
B	he's been given the itinerary so he's got to be up at er and he wants to be up and out really at five o'clock or just after
A	yeah
B	and then he says on the itinerary we're not having dinner till eight o'clock at night I mean how?
A	well they're an hour ahead as well
B	I know that's what I said
A	so
A	yeah not too bad
B	I said I'd have needed about five meals by then
A	yeah pop out your snacks yeah
B	and then they're not home till half nine on I think they land at half nine on Wednesday and then he's going to
A	mm
B	for goodness' sake
A	so it's so that's Monday Tuesday and then straight out
B	yeah
A	right
B	ridiculous ridiculous

B	oh daily
A	what time's the flight then? you said you'd looked and then
B	I did look and now I can't remember
A	you can't no
B	but I know that we're not gonna get to the hotel till really it's like a a three-hour transfer
A	what? it's not a three-hour how many hours that because according to
B	from Sofia Airport?
A	do you know we'd probably cheaper having a taxi oh but there's the
B	it's two it's two hours forty-five minutes I think
A	well
B	that's what it says on the thing so and I don't think
A	oh
B	I know
A	three hours on a coach
B	yeah
A	it's a three-hour flight as well isn't it?
B	yes so we're not gonna be there till getting on for midnight they're two hours ahead aren't they?
A	yeah
B	so it would be ten o'clock so it would be seven o'clock
A	yeah
B	so the flight would be is the flight about half past two or something?
A	yeah I don't think it'll be too late
B	half past two half past three half past four half past five so that would be half seven already
A	yeah
B	so I'm allowing half an hour for luggage and eight nine
A	oh for well I I I can get up any time of the following day

A	four of us and a baby
B	eight and a baby are you coming out to tea next Saturday night? are you?
A	oh now I bet I haven't got the
B	coming to tea?
A	now I didn't store the number
B	do you not just google the number?
A	well
B	you could do
A	then I always think that could be a while looking back on the old log
B	yeah
A	oh no I can't that's being used but I
B	you could google it that would be as easy wouldn't it? or we could just go up there it's just up the road it is master
A	yes it would be as easy to google it
B	it would
A	let's have a look won't be in mail
B	tell me
B	have you been swimming yet?
A	yeah
B	you have?
A	been under the water and everything
B	did you like the water? which swimming pool were you in?
A	yes
A	yes
B	or both of them or?
A	but they both went last Sunday and think they're going again tomorrow they've asked
B	oh auntie
B	she is she's like a fish
A	ah
B	fish
A	yes
B	or as we're learning on this little
A	if you just go call from there does it charge you?
B	I don't know
A	don't know
B	so did you like swimming? did you have armbands and a rubber ring?
A	so it's next Saturday and it's six thirty
B	no
A	put it on the shared?
B	oh I haven't looked on the Ipad actually is it on the stream?
A	has she put? I I dunno what what stream are we on the same?
B	no I didn't see haven't seen the picture yet
unknown_female	hello
A	are we on the same oh hello there could I book a table please for next Saturday the thirtieth?
unknown_female	of course yeah what sort of time were you thinking?
A	erm six thirty
A	well there there's gonna be eight of us but then there's also gonna be a baby and a pushchair is that is that okay? I was wondering if erm we could maybe go on the other side that was quieter you know you normally see everybody on the on the right hand side? I'm thinking we it might be easier with the baby
unknown_female	I can do a table of eight at half six
A	yeah
unknown_female	the only issue is I'm going to need it back for about quarter past eight
A	oh that's fine yeah yeah
unknown_female	is that alright?
A	that's okay yeah
unknown_female	no worries
A	we'll done by quarter eight won't we
B	we will
A	no it'll probably just be his pram to be honest cos he's only erm he's not quite three months old yet so
unknown_female	okay no no no worries at all
A	so if if I'm thinking if we've got a bigger space where we can just put the pushchair that's why I was thinking if it's the other side of the restaurant perhaps
unknown_female	yeah no perfect
unknown_female	erm the so you may as you walk in the left hand side?
A	yeah
unknown_female	no worries
A	that'll be great then yeah
unknown_female	and can I take your name and contact number for yourself?

unknown_female	and the contact number if you would

B	in and out eat go
unknown_female	and you won't even need the need the high seat
A	that's lovely thanks very much
unknown_female	no worries
A	okay then bye-bye
unknown_female	bye-bye
