A	you know when you had sort of a close up of their heads
B	yeah
A	they were almost life size but not overpoweringly big you know?
B	no
C	mm
A	but all the new tellies instead of being square are elongated
B	that's right
A	so you don't get so much height but you get more width
B	yeah
A	and I worked out that a twenty-four was about the same height as the one we had so you didn't get the
C	oh I see
A	the big heads you know?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but because it's twenty-six it seems that
B	trouble is
A	there's something a little bit over powering you know
C	mm
B	yeah
A	because our room isn't very big
B	no
A	so you're sitting fairly close and trying to get near the fire as well
C	mm
B	yeah
A	I've been having to sit further and further back to watch it
B	it it have you got a a smart aspect on yours so
A	yeah
B	that go like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you can see
B	so you can put it on auto
A	that's right auto sixty-nine
B	yeah well sometimes when it's on auto it'll stretch out a an old film or something like that
A	yeah
B	and they look really big and wide
A	that's right yeah
B	Don't they?
A	so you have to close it up
B	so you close it up to the the four by three I think it's called
C	mm
A	but I think one of the problems I had is that I I stuck it on cos you've got two zooms as well
B	you've got zooms yeah
A	I stuck it on the zoom to watch the motorbike racing
B	oh right
A	and of course you forget to turn it off
A	and suddenly you've got this big huge people in your face shouting and ah la la
C	oh I thought that was you again
B	we just watered a plant that's all
A	what was that?
B	just watering a plant
C	I only allow ten minutes
B	pardon?
A	what is that timing the plant?
C	yeah
A	we're watering the plants yeah
B	oh I just sit mine in a bucket of water and
C	yeah well I forget them if I do that
A	and come back about a day later
B	that there pink one is doing really well in in the other room
A	yeah
B	she's now watering all the rest of them
A	yeah I got  I got  a a pink one which has just come out into full flower
B	yeah
A	but before it had about six leaves
B	yeah
A	you know quite a lot
B	oh yeah
A	and it belongs to
B	yeah
A	so I said we'll have them back at mine and sort of look after them until they come into flower
B	oh right
A	you know what I mean I'm I don't know whether to give it back to her
B	while it's in flower?
A	yeah but I know what what she'll do
B	so keep it
A	mm might do
B	yeah
A	mm
B	only I think standing up
A	that's too sunny there innit
B	on there it's too sunny
A	yeah they
B	yeah well
A	yeah that's right
B	and they don't get hardly any sun there
A	no
B	so I don't think she should keep them on the in on the
A	yeah
B	yeah they roast
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	they used to be a real sixty's plant didn't they?
B	they did yeah
A	everyone used to have them
B	and the spider plants yeah
A	yeah and er rubber plants and rubber trees
B	yeah rubber plants
A	we had a rubber tree in our flat and er slowly all the leaves dropped off
B	what?
A	it was growing
B	wow
A	but it had gone eighteen months with no water
B	yeah
A	it's doing quite well
B	that's weird isn't it
A	yeah
B	weird
A	well yeah I suppose so
B	yeah
A	mm
B	by all purposes that was dead
A	mm mm
B	come the summer dead again
A	oh right so it does that then
B	well it's supposed to be in flower in August
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	and they come out in little red flowers
B	I like them
A	and er this particular one has been frozen off twice
B	yeah?
A	and it still had this little bit of green left so I thought well one leaf
B	yeah
A	but I re-potted it in a big pot
B	oh I see yeah
A	you know and give it some roots cos I tend to leave flowers leave these things in too smaller pots
B	yeah
A	you know cos they don't do very well then if you
B	no
A	you know they're so susceptible to drying out
B	they are aren't they yeah
A	you know unless you're very careful watering them
B	yeah
A	whereas with a big pot you know you can put quite a bit in damp in there for them
B	that that plant we reckon that is not very good is dying off
C	yeah
B	that one that we never watered
C	um yeah
B	when you think about we were talking about when you think about where they're living
C	mm
B	not in bright sunlight
C	no no we thought about moving it didn't we
B	yeah
C	we moved that one
B	we moved that one and hopefully that'll survive
C	mm
B	but I think that that one in particular don't like it at all
C	yeah
B	same
C	actually none of them look very happy at the moment
B	well we did have some  we did have some  hot weather didn't we?
C	yes
A	well that's right it was
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah frost
B	yeah
C	cold again
B	so nothing has  nothing has  done anything
C	we'll have to move them all over I'll probably put them all over there
B	learned last night why the potato crop wasn't very good last year
A	Cos of the late frost
B	not only because of the late frost
A	oh right
B	right? Made all the new potatoes very pretty useless and and go all mashy and floury
A	yeah
C	but they had too much water as well wasn't it?
A	it did it was really bad wasn't it
C	early in the year?
B	yeah it was really bad
C	yeah
A	and it was sort of really dry
C	I think that's what it was yeah
B	then really wet then really cold
C	wet and cold
A	and the funny thing is
B	yeah?
C	mm
A	and like all my spuds froze off cos I was trying to grow really early ones
C	yeah
B	you were yeah
A	and er normally that don't matter too much cos that'll grow more won't they?
B	yeah
A	but they never did actually
B	no
A	they just grew a few
B	yeah
A	except for the one I left in the ground cos there seemed to have been plenty more in the
C	right
B	yeah
A	but this year I'm just growing got a main crop
C	mm
A	and I've actually planted them but they haven't come up yet
B	no
C	well we haven't done ours yet have we?
B	well we haven't planted ours yet funnily enough
C	we're still er preparing it aren't we?
B	yeah I'm just preparing it round a bit
A	well I thought there's that warm weather I thought ah I better get the spuds in
B	yeah well
A	he was planting spuds
B	yeah
A	ah
B	well why last year's
C	they all did badly last year didn't they?
B	he said his spuds done so badly last year and he thought that was his own his fault
A	but he found someone else to blame
B	ha ha
A	yeah
B	so they put it down to to the June er May June July
C	mm
B	the bad weather
A	well last year was quite bad for everything wasn't it?
B	that was bad for everything
A	apart from my monster monster squash
B	yeah
A	oh that's right
A	blackberries were alright as well
B	blackberries were alright yeah
C	mm
B	we got loads of raspberries this year
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	but I think the soft fruit got away with no frost
B	yeah?
A	but the carrots didn't do very well cos they
C	the mice ate our beetroot didn't they?
B	yeah
A	you what?
C	the mice ate big holes in the every every one
B	yeah
C	every one
A	mind you slugs do that as well
B	yeah well these were with teeth marks in it
C	well we think it was mice
A	oh right so you had teeth marks yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	we do have a lot of mice in the garden
A	yeah
B	they even eat the potatoes
A	sorry?
B	they even
A	oh really?
B	eat the potatoes away yeah
A	oh God
C	Cos we had these big holes in the ground everywhere
A	yeah
C	no
B	poor little things
C	too many of them
A	poison them
C	no
A	no
B	has it?
A	where would the chicken get a bad leg from?
B	has it got um too much mud? Is it? No it wouldn't be the mud would it
A	that ain't in mud at all
B	no?
A	it's got a lovely sort of erm leafy stuff
B	you'll have to catch one claw
A	yeah
B	that get ripped
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	so what do you do?
B	that'll get better
A	yeah sort of
B	build him a split
A	come and catch it so I can look at it
B	yeah
A	if it don't survive then it don't
B	that's right
A	well this is the thing
B	oh dear
C	oh
A	well I mean otherwise it gets too complicated and there's not enough time in the day
B	yeah course it does
C	mm
A	to sort of like do two visits at once
B	well that's right yeah
A	and er so it's like you end up doing nothing really
B	yeah
C	mm
A	anyway that morning
B	oh right
A	and wouldn't
C	mm
A	I'm not really you know know anything about chickens
B	what?
A	sorry
B	A chicken to a vet oh
C	yeah I wonder what they'd say
A	I expect they would be quite willing sixty quid off you to look at a chicken
C	yeah
B	yeah they would wouldn't they
A	but she was saying
C	mm
A	and she wanted to get some of these er rescue chickens from
B	oh right from
C	oh
A	and er I forget how much it is
B	what? Who's ripping who off?
C	what?
A	for a rescue chicken
C	no
A	and then they had to be had someone come and inspect their premises to make sure that
C	that's right
C	just cos you rescue them?
A	to make sure they were vetted that they were
C	oh
A	when you can go down the market and buy one for a couple of quid
B	yeah
C	they saw them coming
A	and the thing about them rescue chickens they're useless aren't they?
B	well of course they are
C	yeah
A	they're they're bred to live in cages
B	and they've had their beaks cut
A	what's that?
B	so so they can't go around picking up stuff
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and they've had their best years of chicken that egg laying anyway
C	yeah
B	they have
A	and
C	so who is going to pay that much for them?
A	I dunno
B	idiots
A	and every month there's another couple of million available
B	there is isn't there yeah
C	yeah
A	you know what I mean
C	wow what a business if you can find people
A	I should imagine these  I should imagine these  battery birds
B	they're happy to get rid of them
A	they're happy to get rid of them to anyone who would take them
C	mm yeah
B	yeah
A	they just go into fish millet or chicken mill don't they
B	yeah
A	whatever they call it
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	you can ground up to nothing
C	wow
B	ugh
A	but I mean
B	this is what make me angry about all this rescue stuff
A	mm
B	I mean the rescue cats
A	mm
B	they were done
A	mm
B	and and horse meat for or meat for
A	salami
B	but nowadays they have to rescue everything
A	yeah
B	they have to keep everything
A	it's terrible
B	what's all that about?
C	mm
A	well people get really close to their pets you see
B	well they do
A	for some people like the pet is more important than anything else
B	well it is
A	and you can understand them
B	yeah I can understand it
A	well this is the other thing
B	this is the rip off
C	yeah
A	well this is  this is  what we've dealt with
C	Cos your precious pet is like a child or something
B	yeah well it is yeah
A	but you see this is what we were talking before about all these people you know  you know  you can
B	everyone's in on it
A	charging a fortune
C	mm
A	but you know you think that you know if you were gonna have a pet cemetery you'd think right perhaps fifty-sixty quid would cover everything
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but it doesn't
B	no it don't
A	I bet you're talking about four or five hundred
B	well course you are
A	and then if you don't fork up every year to keep the plot
B	yeah
A	you know it just gets like something else gets buried in there as well
C	yeah
B	well of course they do
A	no no no
B	the vet got rid of it
A	extra
C	or you can have  stuffed you know
B	you could have it stuffed yeah
A	that's right yeah
B	oh that that is sick
C	that is
A	but it's a rummon it's a strange I mean it all it's all strange isn't it now?
B	yeah that is
A	the whole thing
B	as you say everything is money orientated
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	you know they're just open season for someone to rip off
B	well that is yeah
C	mm
B	oh we'll look after it
A	otherwise we'll have to kill it
B	oh dear
A	when
C	oh
B	oh God yeah
A	or something like that you know
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and
B	A horse
A	blacky or Stripy or or whatever
C	oh
B	yeah
A	and you know you'd pay on sort of it you know on this sort of deal
B	yeah
A	and
C	your
A	about fifteen years later I'm obviously on the my address is on the data base
B	yeah
A	Cos every year I get this sort of stuff going inviting me to sponsor a horse
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know help do you know what? And it's still got the same picture of the same bloody horse
C	no?
A	I mean it must have died by now
B	that's ridiculous innit yeah
C	oh yeah yeah
A	do you know what I mean? And people think oh I'm I'm keeping that horse alive
B	no you're not
A	yeah making someone rich
B	that's right yeah
A	Cos they need the fields for the horses
C	yeah
A	and er go and live in the you know in the
B	and that's run as a charity so they don't actually pay anything
A	tax no
B	anything for the country estate
A	no taxation pay
B	no taxation or anything like that
A	I mean places like Redwings they get they've got an income of something like ten million a year haven't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	of like donations
C	I know it's huge isn't it?
A	and it's a lot of money isn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and the last thing I saw they were bringing horses over from er Romania
B	yeah?
A	rescue horses from Romania
B	what's the point of that?
A	and then
B	they could feed people over there
C	well they've got more horses for everyone to go and see
B	yeah but that could feed people in Romania couldn't it?
A	well that's right
C	yeah
A	they're taking the food out of the mouths of children
B	huh? They are aren't they yeah
C	well if they bought them from Romania they're giving the money to the people
A	but the thing is
B	no they don't
C	Don't they?
A	I mean the thing is in Romania there's still an awful lot of horses isn't there?
B	yeah there are
A	Cos they're still  they're still  sort of the last sort of stages of the horse and cart industry
B	yeah
A	especially in the countryside
B	I think that's stupid
A	you'd think that any farmer would realise that a horse is an expensive asset
B	yeah
A	you'd treat it properly wouldn't you?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	you would wouldn't you yeah
A	but anyway
B	but I I don't
A	anyway apart from that I mean you think why should Redwings go to blimmin Romania to find horses?
B	Romania yeah
C	yeah
A	and you think what's what's next?
B	when they
A	you know let's go to China and bring some horses back
B	yeah
C	right
B	and all they need do is wait for the Grand National and they'll get plenty
A	but can you  can you  remember years ago there was this mad English woman who was trying to save all the cats in Venice?
B	that's right yeah there was weren't there
A	because there was hundreds and hundreds of feral cats
C	oh right
A	and she use to go around collecting them all up
B	collect them all up yeah
A	and she had thousands and thousands and then couldn't feed them or something like that
B	that's right yeah
A	it was something
C	mm
A	and she was sort of like had this big thing about it
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but in in Russia where they've got the Winter Olympics coming up
B	oh yeah
A	I read the other day that they've got this big thing about shooting all these feral dogs
B	Good
A	Cos there's hundreds of sort of dogs living wild in these sort of areas
C	oh
A	well there is in Romania and places like that
B	well yeah
A	massive great packs of wild dogs
B	yeah
A	and they said for the Olympics there's go around and shoot them all
B	oh there'd be hell to pay wouldn't there huh?
A	mm
B	I mean they're they're talking about the feral cats in in er Scotland
A	that's right yeah
B	loads and loads and they're they're trying
A	interbreeding with the wild cats aren't they yeah
B	yeah and they're going to  they're going to  cull most of the
A	that's the same as badgers innit
C	mm
B	yeah there's the badger one too
A	but I mean trouble is with things like badgers I mean they have lots of cubs every year and they live to be ancient don't they?
B	they do yeah
A	and you you know it's like foxes in London
B	yeah?
A	I mean it's just incredible really
B	that is
A	oh really?
B	yeah there was foxes running up Newmarket road won't it?
A	I haven't seen that
C	yes yeah
A	mm
B	all going round the bins
C	yeah
A	mm
B	that was up Newmarket road wasn't it
A	was that recently?
B	well about two years ago now
C	mm
A	oh really
B	yeah
C	right
A	and she sort of sit there you know doing the washing up and there's a blimmin fox sitting in the garden
C	yeah they're a real problem aren't they in the
A	she's got a cat and she says this fox and this cat sort of just lay there together in the  in the  sun
B	what?
C	really?
A	sunning themselves yeah
C	wow
B	they're usually vowed enemies they are
A	well this is what she says
C	oh
A	well you know it isn't a big one
C	mm
B	yeah?
C	oh
A	I mean they were holding it up and it was like it's feet were there and it's head was on the ground
C	mm
B	wow
A	holding it up by its back feet
B	yeah
A	I mean that is big for a fox innit? Normally you'd think they were about that big wouldn't you yeah
B	yeah
A	sorry?
C	six foot in length? That's including the tail?
A	it would have been six foot with his erm with his tail out
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm mm
B	cor
A	but he was several stone
B	yeah
C	wow
A	you see
B	we come across a badger wasn't it? What colour are badgers?
A	black and white

B	that's what we thought
C	until we saw a dead one very close
A	what it was brown
B	Brown one
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	perfectly brown
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah it was the colour of a fox yeah

C	no it wasn't it was beautiful actually and it had just been  just been  killed hadn't it
B	yeah just been killed
C	somehow or other

B	no
A	was it still alive? Did it squeak?
B	do no that weren't  that weren't  alive
A	did you see any marks on it?
B	the flies had  the flies had  then started to come down
C	mm
B	that was bleeding at the mouth
A	oh
C	mm
B	so
A	so like poison innit yeah
B	yeah it was poisoned
A	but erm you should have kept it and had it stuffed
B	should have took it to
A	yeah
C	unless it just fell off the cliff
B	one one person said well I I told them about the fox he said this er badger
C	oh yeah yeah free food

C	mm
A	well

A	I mean they are
C	mm
A	yeah
B	the speed that was running took it across the other side of the road and into the verge didn't it?

B	grass is growing quick
A	yeah
C	although the grass we'd sewn here
A	oh I see the birds ate it
C	hmm?
B	loads of birds apparently were were on it
A	what you have to do
C	but I think it's killed now
A	what you have to do
C	yeah?
A	is to seed it
B	over the top
A	stop the birds getting to it
C	yeah we should have done that
A	and then you can take the polythene off
B	yeah
A	that grows really quickly like that
B	we'll have to do something like that
A	in the right conditions
B	you've still got some haven't you
C	only a little bit left
A	well the weeds are growing
B	no
C	the weeds are growing yeah that'll look alright
B	there's a mole gone right acrossed it

B	there's a mole gone right acrossed it
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's heaped it up like that all the way along like that
A	brilliant
C	at least they haven't come up
A	that's just like
B	yeah
C	mm
C	yeah I think it must be
B	still
A	well it's amazing cos like in my garden I've got these erm flowers in flower pots
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know like sort of growing on and stuff
B	yeah
A	you know it's just like full of grass if you don't watch it
C	yeah
B	yeah you just all when when I pot something up just using the outside muck
A	mm
B	A molehill for instance
A	yeah
B	Cos molehills are really good
A	that's right yeah
B	out on there pot pot it all up
C	oh yeah
A	oh there is yeah
B	well they reckon the poppy seed last over a hundred years
A	mm mm
B	and that only grow on cultivated land
A	they used their field when you drove down the A twelve down to Ipswich
B	yeah
A	and then there was a triangle bright red
B	yeah?
A	and every year that'd be like poppies would be growing in this
C	mm
A	it was just a little wild meadow or something
C	yeah
B	lovely
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	bluebells? I've got a garden full of Bluebells

B	I went we went
A	and Dandelions got a lot of Dandelions
B	oh Dandelions where do they suddenly spring from
A	I don't know
C	yeah?
A	you know thinking well what I'll do is every time I see a yellow one is I'll pick it and stop them seeding right
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and I did that for two days and then God there's just thousands of them you know you're sort of seeing
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I'm going along with my little hook tool
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but I am gonna not mow my grass
C	are you?
A	I'm gonna let it grow
C	oh
A	well I think I keep mowing it
C	oh I see yeah
A	I never use it and er
C	mm
A	I'll just mow a track to the  to the  washing line
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I think well I might as well let it grow
C	yeah
B	yeah well that's true
C	although we let the bottom grow
B	yeah
C	well the amount of Nettles and Dock and that
B	docks
C	oh and it was really hard to get back
B	that just
A	yeah
B	they just took over the Docks and the Nettles
C	they did
B	and the what's that other stuff called? Hogweed
C	oh yeah
B	hogweed Docks and well
C	mm
B	they're horrible
A	well that erm
B	oh erm
A	in the hedgerows all white and kind of
B	yeah May May no not Mayflower

B	erm Cowparsley
C	medowsweet?
B	medowsweet
A	no not Medowsweet
C	not Cowparsley? No
A	it could be
B	cowparsley yeah yeah
C	mm they're all the same sort of thing really
A	sort of like big stuff growing really quickly
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and it all comes into flower really early
B	yeah big flowers on the top like that yeah
A	yeah
C	really thick yeah
A	go down like erm Horseradish
B	like a Horseradish
A	yeah
B	and you only get if you  if you  snap the root off
A	that just grows two don't it
B	that just grow two lots
A	yeah
C	I tried to get the Hogweed root out today er on top of the hill
B	well that go down miles don't it?
B	no that go down miles
A	what you wanna do is get some rabbits
C	we've got rabbits
B	we've got rabbits
A	no I mean ones ones what you keep for food
B	oh yeah
C	yeah
B	I've stuffed a netting down the er the rabbit hole
C	hmm?
B	I've stuffed some netting down the rabbit hole
C	have you?
A	what under your shed?
B	yeah
C	I I've put a log the other end
B	did you put a log the other end? Have you?
C	yeah
A	probably babies down there that are starving to death
C	he'll find another place
B	probably
C	we've done that before haven't we?
A	oh
C	we've put water down before
B	we have yeah
A	just soaks away
C	and it doesn't seem to to get them gone
B	no
C	I reckon they've got
B	I
C	you don't want to hurt them do you? But
B	no I don't wanna hurt them no
A	they can smell the sewage can't they
B	I want to eat them
B	I haven't trapped any
C	I mean I think the shed will fall down because of the rabbits
B	that probably will yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	no I know
B	but I moved everything into my workshop
B	huh
C	I haven't planned in
A	it is yeah
B	yeah
C	I need to do the barn I think
B	yeah behind behind there we're we're planning on doing that
C	mm
A	what closing it off?
B	well the barn you know where the old tin
A	the lean to bit?
B	yeah the lean to bit
C	yeah
B	do it properly I think
C	well not properly but
B	might do it properly
A	well yeah
B	you know how it is
C	we can enclose it so that it's erm
B	well we bought
A	no I think it's better open cos cos
B	yeah I think that's better open
C	why?
A	well cos when you close things they get all full of lumber and
B	yeah
A	and dank and
B	damp and
A	damp
C	well there's lumber there now so
A	yeah well when it's open it's like the wind's blowing through it and you can get to things and
B	yeah
C	we can leave the door open
A	but when you've got a side there like you you can't put poke things out and er you know
B	mm
A	Cos you've got space which is all enclosed
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	it's sort of like a big outside bit
C	mm
B	yeah
A	as long as it's dry
B	yeah that's dry innit innit
C	yeah
A	reasonably
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	I don't know
A	what?
C	I don't know
B	we left a door to the for the Swallows to get in now
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	really? That's early innit?
B	they're in in in in er Cornwall weren't it?
A	oh I see
B	yeah
A	it'll take another month to get up here weren't it?
B	yeah
A	yep
B	that weren't a Swallow was it? And the next day they were flying about like that you know
B	but I don't know whether they were Swallows or not I think they were House not Housemartins
A	mm mm
B	or you know something like that
A	mm mm
B	Cos they are the first ain't they the Martins and then the Swallows and then the Swifts innit
B	yeah
A	there was loads and loads of them
B	yeah?
A	well loads and loads of them
B	yeah?
A	which is quite a lot I suppose
B	yeah
A	and like the cliff was actually completely studded with
B	drilled with holes
A	drilled with holes
B	yeah
A	well it's always falling down innit?
B	and then they had to bought the council have now bought the houses haven't they? And and demolished them
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but cos you know there's this thing about
B	why have they bought the houses?
A	I don't know
B	seems stupid to go and
A	no the government
B	did it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	ten years
B	yeah
A	I mean they're not giving them full compensation
B	no but the people who bought them houses on the cliff knew
A	well yeah of course
B	exactly what was going to happen
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	so
C	that's why you they're cheaper aren't they
B	that's why they're a lot cheaper
A	yeah
B	they're a lot cheaper than anywhere else you can buy anything
C	mm
B	but I mean they they bought the house when that's the cliff and that was the house
A	yeah
B	and now that's their house and that's the cliff now
A	exactly yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	you know I suppose they've got this theory that they won't you know just chuck people out of their houses
B	that's right yeah
A	you know willy nilly just cos it's you know just cos it's dangerous
B	yeah
A	so they have to give them something I suppose
B	well I suppose they do yeah
A	yeah
B	but I mean when people did buy the houses on there they knew that the cliffs were eroding that's all
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	makes you wonder how long that'll be before the pub and the church go down
B	well that's right yeah
A	I mean they're quite a way away now
B	and what about the lighthouse?
A	well the lighthouse as well yeah
B	yeah the lighthouse is
A	I mean it's quite a way away
B	yeah yeah
A	but you think well a hundred years or something
B	well that's gotta be hasn't it yeah
A	that must be nearly seven hundred years' time
B	I was at the dentist a couple of
A	mm mm
B	funnily enough in a dentist
B	and er in oh I forget um how long ago
A	mm
B	and they're talking about it because the ice is melting
A	we're doomed
B	yeah to have a huge tsunami which will actually wash away East Anglia
A	yeah
B	are you worried?
A	no
B	no I'm not worried
A	I mean the thing is we thought they come out with these theories
B	well cause it's only a theory yeah
A	I mean it is true that places like Greenland they're lifting out of the sea
B	that's lifting out of the sea cos they're two two centimetres a year innit?
B	yeah
A	they're coming up
B	that's right yeah
A	that's right yeah and what have you and
B	yeah
A	then the Gandhis' will dry up
B	yeah wash away all the villages cos they'll wash away all the villages
A	yeah
B	no
A	that's dead embarrassing innit with something like that
C	oh dear
B	well that that that was very very like er the British mission to Mars weren't it
A	oh yeah that yeah
B	when they had two different measurements
A	was that the British mission or was that the American one?
B	that was American come British
A	yeah that weren't the er
B	when they tried to land that thing on on Mars
A	that's right yeah
B	oh well right
C	oh what one in metric and one in imperial measurements?
B	one in metric and one in imperial measurements yeah
A	oh well
C	mm
A	I ought to get going but that's so blimmin um
B	yeah
C	would you like another cup of tea?
A	er
C	oh right
B	why not? You can have another cup of tea if you like
A	yeah yeah why not
B	yeah
C	I'm just really thirsty
A	pardon?
C	really thirsty at the moment
B	well you've you've got a
A	have you got a thing in your throat? Which I mean you sort of like you wanna cough up it
A	I've got one as well
B	yeah
A	they're like a sticky thing in the back of your throat
B	yeah
A	and I think well normally it's like
B	and it's gone but it
A	but
B	I I think there's loads of people had that this year
A	I wonder what it is
C	mm
B	I don't know what it is
A	yeah but it doesn't seem like a virus
B	no it's not a virus is it
C	no
B	it's just a stupid thing
C	just annoying
A	it just seems like you've got a bit of toast or something stuck in your throat that you can't get rid of
C	yeah
B	that's right
A	could be
B	well we are doomed
A	doomed
B	we're doomed
C	I'll go and see if Tom wants a cup of tea
B	where's
C	she said she'd like a ginger tea
B	A ginger tea
C	yeah
B	she don't want coffee?
C	no
B	there's something the matter with her
C	erm
E	I'm here
B	what are we gonna eat? Oh
E	I'm here
B	you're having a ginger tea that's what
E	yes
B	and she said you were going to have a ginger tea
E	yes
B	I should think you've done your head is done in innit?
E	yeah well I've just been sorting out some emails
B	have you?
E	and looking at some news
B	all that on I I can't work on a computer that long
E	yeah
B	especially with that big screen
E	yeah
B	that doesn't help having a big screen
E	and that screen is very bright
B	yeah
E	so bright
B	I've turned turned it right down to
E	I know but it's brighter than
B	yeah
E	yeah it's a shame you can't turn it down any more
B	yeah tippling down
E	yeah
B	tippling down like mad
B	oh yeah
A	you know erm Windows Seven?
B	yeah
A	that only works on sixty-four bit computers don't it?
B	and and thirty-two
A	but most computers nowadays are sixty-four
B	yeah they are
A	is yours sixty-four then?
B	no thirty-two
E	yeah
A	I was just wondering if you've got you know a new computer that's sixty-four bit windows seven on it
B	no
A	isn't there you can't isn't there a thing where you can you know?
B	there used to be on the other ones but there there isn't on the sixty-four bit one
A	well this is what I thought
B	yeah it's different
A	so you can't run anything old no old programs on that?
B	I don't think so no
A	mm
B	it's like trying to run er Windows Ninety-Five
A	mm
B	you know it was only sixteen bit
A	yeah
B	I can't run any sixteen bit stuff on a thirty-two bit computer
A	yeah
B	they did yeah
A	where you could actually set it up so that it would run
B	yeah
A	and like Windows Seven is so big I'm sure they must or maybe they haven't included that in it
B	er not on the sixty-four I don't think on the sixty-four bit you I think you've got it on the thirty-two bit but not
B	Cos you can buy the two bit you can buy the two ones
A	mm
B	and I think they actually on a sixty-four bit one that will downgrade to a thirty-two bit one
A	yeah
B	I I couldn't be quite sure
A	oh no no
B	yeah
A	and and a new laptop
B	yeah
A	and it's a pretty good one
B	dual Core?
A	and so you've got
B	A dual core one for sixty-four bit?
A	yeah and I had three dual core no doubt
B	yeah
A	and er she's sort of worried about all her old like Office and Photoshop
B	photoshop weren't work on it
A	mm
B	I don't know whether Photoshop will allow you to upgrade to sixty-four bits
A	mm
B	Cos they did do er with XP they did do a sixty-four bit on XP and if she's got XP
A	mm
B	an old Office weren't work at all
A	Cos they want to flog you a new one
B	yeah
A	but I told her Open Office and Google
B	yeah
A	they'll work
B	yeah yeah they'll work yeah
A	Google's alright actually
B	yeah it's alright innit
A	I tried it a couple of year ago and it was a bit clunky
B	yeah
A	but
B	oh was she? Yeah
A	and er you know I mean it seemed to work fine
B	yeah
A	yeah
E	can you go and tip your barrow over? I think
C	no it's full up with stuff
E	it's gonna be full up with water now
C	mm
E	oh
C	pardon?
E	do you want fajitas tonight?
C	you what?
E	do you want fajitas?
C	oh yeah okay
E	yeah?
C	okay
E	mm mm
C	no
E	oh well that's alright
C	we usually have quite a lot of
E	Cos the salsa that comes with it is quite small
C	mm
E	oh well
B	they've done a lot of work on Open office
E	yeah I do all the time have
B	it's alright in just the word but it's not any good in the format is it?
E	no it if you send documents over the internet as attachments with Open Office the formatting changes completely
B	yeah
E	you have to put it all in
A	put it all in doc
E	yeah you have to put in all in doc before you send it
A	well that's yeah that's easy enough
E	which you can do in Open Office
A	well no you get a when you save it
E	my friend she can't do anything with hers
A	when you save it in Open Office you click save and you get the that thing which says where do you wanna save it?
B	save in doc
E	as doc?
A	and then underneath it says as doc with the thing
E	well we
A	and you can just click that and off you go
E	yeah but we've still had lots and lots of problems
A	yeah
B	it doesn't
B	yeah it it it gives an extra line somewhere in it
E	yeah
A	mm
E	so even if you save it as a doc
A	what you need  what you need  to do is upgrade
E	mm
A	and there's probably some new upgrade on it which you know
B	yeah there probably is but that's
E	no I don't like it at all
A	have you got the latest version?
E	I don't know it's dad's I'm using
B	I've got  I've got  the latest version yeah
A	Cos something I don't know they mind you I don't do that much with it but don't you think?
B	no
E	you know that task that I did? I I did a task the other day for a company
A	but if you
E	I copied all of the tables and I used used Open office
B	yeah that's the tables
E	and I had to cos cos they were formatted tables as well
A	mm
E	um so that they go straight into the internet program
A	mm
E	Cos I can't send it with Open Office
A	mm
E	and send it from here
B	yeah
E	Cos you can't because otherwise it'll all go wrong
A	mm
E	and I had to say in my email they've they're completely different
A	but have you got a PDF creater?
E	mm
B	yeah
E	but the the thing is those
A	but you see I reckon that sending emails and stuff you're a hundred times better sending them in PDF
B	yeah
E	oh yeah but this was a task
A	Cos that's so quick innit?
B	that is
E	this was a programmed word document which had
A	yeah
E	they just copy straight into an internet program
A	ah yeah
E	and it's all got formulas and things so I don't
B	yeah
A	that if you're  if you're  trying to copy a document or anything like that or or you've got a form to fill out
B	are you alright
A	that is desperate cos Sarah has that from college
E	mm
A	you know they keep sending the forms
B	yeah
A	and er you can't do anything with them
E	thank you
B	nope
A	you know
B	that's weird innit
E	nah
A	but it is three hundred quid cheaper than Office
E	is it?
B	oh yeah
A	I mean to buy Office you'd pay
E	well that's only good if it if you
B	office is three hundred quid
E	oh
B	and Open Office is er nil
E	yeah
B	so I mean
E	yeah but you if you still need somebody else's computer
B	yeah that's that's true
E	mm
B	altogether
A	that's the same with Microsoft Publisher isn't it
B	yeah
A	you can't open that with anything
B	anything
A	unless you've got Office
E	that?
C	yep
E	well where did they all go?
C	with peanuts
E	oh he's got his peanuts
A	I'll tell you what
B	waitrose?
A	well she was visiting my mum
B	oh right yeah
A	and buying some
B	oh yeah you told me yeah
A	and they had sort of like peanuts embedded in em
E	mm
A	and the biscuity bit was a bit like a cross between meringue and biscuit
B	oh wow
C	mm
A	with peanuts in em
B	were they? Yeah
C	mm
E	mm
A	you'd like them if you like peanut butter
E	mm
A	ha ha well they were really good
C	mm
B	huh
E	yeah we used to get a big bag of them
B	why don't they do?
A	they still do in Nettos
B	nettos do they?
A	yeah it is yeah
B	where's Nettos then?
A	well it's disappeared now
B	well they disappeared
C	they don't still do them then
A	well I think they closed down ever since they had that um scandal where you'd go go in Nettos and buy chicken pieces
C	oh yeah
B	oh yeah
A	remember they traced them back to that place where that guy bought them
C	mm
A	was buying erm condemned chicken
B	condemned chicken and selling them off
C	mm
A	which had been stained because it was condemned
E	oh dear
A	and he was washing it in bleach to get rid of the staining
E	oh dear
A	and then repackaging it and selling it to Netto's
E	ugh
B	that was yeah
E	that's the thing about
B	there's some weird people about isn't there eh?
A	this is once again
B	once again it's
A	try anything to turn any trick no matter
E	yeah
B	money means too much to people
A	well I think you've you've got the stage where you haven't
E	hello
A	you know people need so much to live on don't they?
B	well they do yeah
A	yeah
B	need quite a lot to live on nowadays
A	well I was reading somewhere that I forget what it was that was talking about pensioners
C	what? Oh
A	you know I thought fourteen thousand a year
B	what?
A	that's a lot of money
B	that is a lot of money
A	for a pensioner
B	wow
C	oh that's when they get their own personal pension? Or pension from work?
A	well no it was just some article about
E	that's a pension from work that one
C	mm
A	that was a article about how much pension is needed to live on
C	mm
B	oh what are they doing? Going abroad on holidays and
A	well this is the thing innit
B	they do actually
C	they do actually the people I know that they
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	and she's ever since I've known her she's spent money like water
B	yeah
A	with absolutely no you know
B	regards for it
A	regard to it
B	yeah
A	and she'd have one for a couple of years
B	they're not cheap are they?
A	no and that every time that was getting more and more expensive
B	yeah
A	I mean she had a conservatory built
B	yeah
A	never the cheap ones either
B	no
A	then she turned up she had to have a she'd paid someone to put a water softener in
B	yeah
A	if not thousands
B	yeah
A	and at the drop of a hat
B	oh
E	mm
A	she just spend money
E	yeah
A	not a thought in her head you know not sort of thinking blimmin heck you know
B	yeah
A	I could do with some of this loot you know
C	yeah
E	mm
A	and put it to much more better use
B	yeah
E	mm
B	well you put one lot of loot to a better use
B	got that red shiny one outside
A	oh yeah
C	mm
E	is that a new car?
B	yeah
A	it's not new
C	it's beautiful
E	oh
B	that's newer than ours
E	what about your bike?
A	what about it?
E	you've still got it?
B	he's still got his bike
A	yeah
E	oh good
A	yeah I didn't have to trade that in
E	hmm mm
B	he just traded
E	no it's nice
B	you
E	no what? The car is nice
B	oh right I thought you said that's nice because she he traded
A	it was the most expensive car I've ever bought
B	yeah
C	mm
B	I think you've got a bargain I mean looking at it and listening to it
A	well it seems to like I say it seems to be alright
C	it's a lovely car innit?
E	yeah
A	but the thing I like about it is
B	economical
A	it's sort of got plenty of meat around it
B	mm
A	it's a pretty solid thing
E	mm
B	mm
C	mm
A	and er
E	yeah you don't want the ones that just crumple at a touch
B	well this is  this is  er this it but um and also there's not many of them about
B	no
A	so you you know
B	did they?
A	yeah
B	oh right
C	yeah they
A	and then they left it a couple of years and then they started making them again
B	huh
E	what is it?
A	it's a Citron Xsara
E	oh
A	X Sara
E	uh-huh
A	but they the reason they started making them again is because they use exactly the same
B	gigs
A	what is it chassis? And everything
B	yeah
A	and the engine for the Xsara Picasso right
B	oh right
A	you know those ones with the sort of dome shaped things
E	uh-huh
A	and they're exactly the same
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and they started churning them out again
C	oh right
A	but the trouble is you can't get a a handbook which is
B	yeah
A	like the air-conditioning and stuff like this
C	hm
A	and all the controls and all this stuff on the steering wheel
B	yeah
A	and like you get er you know we had we didn't get a book with it
C	oh
A	and of course it's all that
B	oh
A	although it's the book for that modal
B	yeah
C	mm
A	it doesn't actually tell you what all the things do
E	oh
A	but who cares eh?
B	well I suppose you can search on the net for some answers can't you?
A	yeah I expect so
C	that's right
A	but it would be nice to know how the
B	yeah
C	oh I see
A	and how it how to operate the controls
B	yes
A	or more diesel
E	yep
C	yeah
A	but I'll tell you what it don't use
B	does it? Yeah that's good
C	mm
A	well it's good in one
B	no you can't
A	you know you put your  you put your  foot down and it just sort of like pulls off
B	yeah
A	you don't
E	the car that I hired was very good on the diesel
A	yeah
E	and it had good acceleration
A	yeah
B	yeah well that was a new one weren't it
A	yeah but they are very light
E	mm
A	you see what I mean? Whereas these are very heavy
E	yeah yeah
A	and you know you're dragging a lot more weight around with you
B	yeah
A	and sort of rev it up through the gears but I'm sort of used to just like
B	yeah right
A	it's sort of lazy driving really
B	well ours ours
E	mm like ours
B	well yeah well ours is very lazy driving innit
E	I'm a very lazy driver
B	but it's got erm if you're going to trying to pass something and they put their toe down or something and you're going like that
A	mm
B	you either got to fall back or you stick your foot down to the boards and that'll broom
A	that's right
B	and that'll just go
A	mm
B	no I don't suppose it has
A	you know I mean it's good yeah
B	no that's right
A	you see what I mean
C	mm
A	and like you need two and a half thousand to get the turbo working
B	yeah
A	and that sort of gap between putting your foot down and trying to get up to the turbo coming in
B	yeah
A	it's just sort of you have to change down gears which you know as a young driver you're sort of quite good at
E	I like  I like  doing the gears
A	mm
E	see you got you're used to automatic now
C	yes we are
B	well I'm I'm very used to automatic now
E	you forget don't you
A	is yours automatic?
C	it's lovely
B	yeah
A	oh I see right
C	easy drive
A	yeah
B	and that's just got this booster where if you put your toe down that go in into a boosting
A	kick down it's called
B	kick down
C	oh
A	yeah
B	it's got the kick down
C	no that come unusual really
B	yeah
C	we had a choice of two
A	mm
C	and I plumped for one that would happened to be automatic
A	mm
B	no
C	I know but you enjoy it too don't you
B	I do
E	it's so  it's so  nice just to
A	it hasn't hasn't got a erm
E	doesn't it keep you awake having to use the gears and stuff?
B	not on a motorway
A	no
C	no
B	you can still fall asleep on the motorway
C	oh you
A	yeah
C	ah
A	at the er you haven't got a cruise control as well?
B	no
A	if you had an automatic and cruise control you just click it in
B	yeah
C	that will
A	and I'll tell you what
B	that isn't gonna be that far away
C	for thirty years I've said haven't I?
E	what with little sensors on the front
A	yeah that's right
C	haven't I?
B	yes you have
C	probably more than that
A	you won't have to steer it at all on a motorway you know
E	mm
A	you know
E	mm
A	what's the point of steering? All you've got to do is
C	yeah just make sure you're so far away from your next vehicle
A	make sure your not
B	you'll have a satellite guiding you round
A	and it will
B	well that's true yeah
C	mm
A	and recognises when it goes off the lines or whatever
E	yeah
A	and just that
E	yep
B	yeah yeah and and you
A	make a cup of tea
A	play your i-phone
B	and you won't be able to get any closer than two chevrons away
C	no
A	that's right
C	mm mm
B	why have some roads got
E	what's a chevron?
C	it's
E	the
C	yes
B	it's these these er arrows like that
C	the arrow things
B	right?
E	oh
C	mm
E	oh okay
B	and they'd tail you
A	it's an upside V
E	mm
B	yeah and it tell you to keep two chevrons away
A	you know? It's a braking distance
C	have you not come across them?
E	on the road?
B	yeah
C	it says keep two chevrons away
A	it's the
E	what in English?
B	yes that's true
A	no they say it in you know German
E	no?
E	well I I I thought it was  it was  a symbol that read that before
C	no it says quite clearly keep two chevrons away
A	no it's just a mark on the road like
E	I've never heard of a chevron
A	and like when the car in front of you go over the chevron
E	mm
A	you should the you should be going over your chevron
C	mm
A	you see what I mean? So that gap
E	yeah
A	no they're not
E	no no
B	no no no no
C	that's just
A	these are a speed control
B	and and a gap
E	I er I haven't been on a big motorway
B	oh yes they're on the motorways
C	yeah
A	but they also have this
E	so I haven't seen them
A	but what's that thing you have to count?
C	yes you have
E	no I haven't
B	oh yeah you do have to
A	there's another  there's another  one isn't there?
C	oh
B	yeah oh yeah
A	there's another one isn't there when the car in front goes over the line
E	I haven't been on any big motorways
C	right
A	you have to count what? Up to what before you go over the line?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	that's one say something
B	yeah
C	that's what you're supposed to do
A	one hippopotamus
C	but they don't say that do they
C	they don't have a label saying it do they
B	but that's that's the speed you'll be at
C	mm
E	yeah
C	mm
B	that's that's the guideline
E	yeah cos we had to learn all the distances
A	but the chance of him stopping is like hitting a brick wall
B	yeah
C	oh
A	which is ridiculous really isn't it
B	that is innit yeah
A	Cos he's gonna take some time to stop isn't he
B	he is isn't he
E	oh me too
B	because you get idiots
E	you never know what's gonna happen
B	we're we're travelling at seventy mile an hour in the middle lane
E	mm
B	and a car
A	bet they're moving on you and flashing you
B	no a car on the inside lane would come past you and then out into the middle lane and then
A	well usually it's people who come you know up the slip road
B	yeah
A	they come roaring up the slip road
C	mm
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	right across to the overtaking lane
E	yeah
B	and you wonder why people have accidents
E	yeah
C	mm
E	this
B	but you you
E	yeah
A	mm
B	and then you go back again
E	yep
B	and then someone else will come up like lightning
E	oh that's that's what always happens to me
B	yeah
E	Cos I leave quite a
A	mm
B	yeah
E	then I get people overtaking me and then going in there
C	and then
E	and I'm thinking what was the point of that
B	yeah what's the point of that?
E	there you're you're still behind whatever I'm behind
B	yeah yeah
E	and they sit there
A	it's very annoying
B	but
E	but then they do it one at a time don't they?
C	mm
B	I like comfortable driving now
E	yeah
A	White knuckle
B	instead of knuckle
E	yeah
A	but I still sort of driving along I still sort of like momentarily you know oh you
A	and I think calm down and thought what the hell who cares you know
E	calm
B	yeah yeah
A	and just carry on
E	yeah
A	Cos cos like it's so easy to get wound up innit? When you're driving
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I remember getting would up when I was in the big van
E	yeah
B	this here bloke
A	mm
B	you have to get out and round and of course you're over the other side of the road
E	mm
B	when when you're going round this corner
E	yeah
B	this bloke was coming down
E	did you look angry?
B	I must have looked very angry
A	it's when you do something like that and then the other bloke gets out of his car
E	yeah
B	yeah
B	but he he did run away and and I was only going to
E	mm
B	otherwise I'd have run over the path er or hit the lamp post
E	we're not a beeping culture anyway are we
B	no
E	uh-uh
C	mm
B	but he did
C	did you?
B	when that bloke
C	oh yeah
A	giving it stopped you from giving him a piece of your mind
C	I think it was cos he thought
B	that's right
C	mm
A	mm
B	and there's nowhere
C	it's a single track really
B	it's a single track bit
A	yeah
B	there's nowhere to go
A	mm
B	he didn't
C	mm
B	so I stopped in the middle of the road and went like that
A	oh I see right
B	so he didn't
A	what was his name?
B	and in the end he did go back
C	yeah
B	didn't he? But this bloke was such a
C	mm
B	he had his golf kit
A	mm
C	yes you were getting a bit angry weren't you
B	and I stopped and I was going to get out and give him a bit of my mind
A	calm down
E	yeah you don't wanna get in a fight
A	mm
C	no
B	no well he was old anyway
A	yeah you already sussed that out
B	I'd sussed that out yeah
A	yeah well he had a bag of golf clubs didn't he
B	he had a bag of golf clubs
A	he could have attacked you with a four iron or something
B	I had a crisp bag
A	you had some oranges to chuck at him
B	yeah I did
C	er
B	no that
A	mm mm
B	and
E	what down the hill
B	and for some reason or other this Mercedes was going
A	mm mm
B	there was a car coming down and this Mercedes jumped in right in front of us and stopped
A	he stopped?
B	he stopped
A	what for?
B	and he got out of his car
B	well
A	yeah
B	and a few fisty nearly fisty cuffs
E	mm
A	mm
E	is like
B	is like
C	mm
B	he we we didn't have any poke at all you know
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that was an old Ford
A	yeah
B	you know
A	well I mean some people ain't got the sense
C	no
A	it's true
A	that some people just don't haven't got a clue
C	yeah
A	once one winter I was going home from here and I went through the back way through you know the
B	yeah
A	and er I'm at
B	that's right
C	mm
A	and the road is a sheet of ice right
E	mm
A	I mean it's not much of a hill but it was very icy
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and I was sort of weighing it up
C	oh no
C	oh
A	and as I sussed this out and sort of pulled you know sort of pulled over into this sort of gateway
C	oh
E	oh
A	and was sort of was there sort of and this truck was just sort of crabbing backwards down this IV vehicle
C	oh
B	oh
A	and he was sort of there you know er trying looking to somewhere to get past it
B	ooh
C	yeah
A	and you think can't you see what's happening
E	yeah
A	and you think no he couldn't
C	mm
A	you know
B	didn't have the
A	you know
B	didn't have the
A	why didn't he just drive away?
E	yeah
B	didn't have the common sense
C	the number of times I've stopped  I've stopped  up by the church waited for the cars that are coming through
A	mm
B	at at the chicane there
C	you have to really don't you?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	Cos there's cars parked the other side
B	yeah
A	and yet a car's coming up the road over you and
B	yeah
A	mm
C	then they've got to reverse all the way back haven't they
A	mm
C	they can't see it
B	no
E	mm
B	I told you about this didn't I
A	mm
B	and another bloke was coming down
E	what in that voice?
C	oh dear
E	hmm
C	hmm
B	and he went spare and his wife had to hold him down
E	oh
B	and me and
E	what are you teaching
B	that was the end of that
C	mm yeah
B	so I
A	and who was in the shop?
C	yes
B	and he was in the shop
E	oh no
B	and I walked in the shop
E	who was it? Do you know who it is?
B	I don't know who it is from Adam
E	no you'd never seen him?
B	walked in the shop
A	you were all prepared to have a slanging match
C	mm
A	and another thing
A	that's like I I heard this guy call me a stupid old git
B	did he?
A	in in er cos where I live there's like the pavement there and then there's a a road which goes down to the school
E	mm
A	and but this is the main road here right
E	mm
A	I sort of walked across it not very fast
E	you have right of way if you're on on an inside road
A	yeah exactly he should have given way
E	did you just stand there in the middle of the road?
A	no I sort of like turned round
E	and that's a
C	oh
E	and then he would have been fuming bout that the whole day probably just cos hot head people are aren't they
A	well that's right
E	ah
C	mm
A	and they had two little kids in the back you know and
B	yeah
A	and and he was going you cunt you should look where you're going
E	mm mm
A	and as I walked away he sort of like zoomed off and shouted out of the window
C	oh dear
A	but you know I'm not I really you know this sort of
B	that you have the right of way
A	that they have to give way to a pedestrian if they turn into a a junction
B	that's right yeah
C	yeah
E	no they don't think do they?
A	they don't even know
E	yeah
B	this is my road
A	and like quite often as I'm crossing like crossing like I'm walking up there like twice a day you know
B	well cause you don't know
A	although it's your right of way you know
B	yeah
A	but it sort of and they sort of like stop and pay grace and say oh come on you can walk if you like
B	yes
B	yeah that's weird
A	you know they started to building the houses
B	they've started building have they?
B	yeah
B	oh God
A	and but they haven't been there at all this week
B	haven't they?
A	I suppose they had a couple of days off for Easter and took the whole week off
B	took the whole week off yeah
A	but they've got a lot of plant there
B	have they?
A	they've got all pretty new
B	yeah
A	they've got a JCB
B	yeah
A	they've got a dumper
B	yeah
A	and er what else have they got there? They've got a water bowser and you know and you know all this sort of it's sort of more there seems to be more plant than there are blokes
B	crikey
B	yeah
A	and bricked up the damp course
B	oh
A	A soak way or something like that
E	are you alright?
C	yeah
E	yeah?
A	but since since it's been raining and they've gone away like they've got this massive great trench
unknown_female	aww
A	and like the water level is
B	is it? Well it must be
A	well there is
B	yeah that's right
C	mm
A	so how they're gonna put soak ways in if you've got a water table that high?
B	well that's right yeah
A	they won't be allowed to will they?
B	no they won't will they
A	no
B	they might put tanks in
A	what?
B	they might put tanks in
A	yeah but if they do the tanks will fill up with water won't they
B	well they will yeah
A	Cos I mean they only they're two way aren't they? They're suppose to soak out but they'll just fill up
B	yeah
C	mm
A	God knows
B	but they might put er
A	oh yeah for grey water
B	for grey water yeah
C	mm
A	yeah yeah
B	then you get it
A	but this site is absolutely full
B	aren't they?
A	you know what you were saying about these people
B	yeah
A	no on checks once they've put the plans through
B	they don't
A	they seem to be a lot closer to my fence than they should be
B	do they?
A	and er
B	yeah
A	and then all the so more they dug out they sort of dumped all round the site
B	oh
A	and er
B	cause they would
A	they've sort of like been run over cos there's not space at all to do anything
B	no
C	oh
B	that's a bit stupid weren't it?
A	and they haven't even tried to put a road in
B	you put a road in first
A	yeah
B	that's right yeah
A	not this mob
C	mm
A	so that will be interesting to see how
C	yeah
B	well you can go out and give them some ideas
A	sort of lean on the gate
B	that's it
C	mm
A	yeah
B	no
A	considering that what the houses they've put the footings in they're already sold
B	yeah?
A	and there's people waiting there to move in
B	they've already sold them have they?
A	well that one they have yeah
B	wow
C	mm
A	I think they've already sold two of them
B	have they?
A	but you'd think they'd whip them up and get the money wouldn't you? And
B	you would
A	that's right
C	oh
A	but it's going to be interesting next week
B	yeah
A	and like in the mornings and in the afternoons
B	wow
A	that road is just jammed with cars
C	yeah
A	you know these big four wheel
C	mm
B	well Yeah
A	and picking them up again
C	right
B	yeah
A	and so like there's cars parked there for about an hour
B	to get a place yeah
A	so they don't have to walk more than five yards
B	that's right
C	no
A	and er then they sort of the later ones who sort of stay behind for half an hour or whatever it is
B	no
C	mm
A	but that road is chocker
B	have they?
A	and you know when they get you know the the brickies
C	yeah
