A	can I have one of those please?
B	shall we walk round the other way?
A	what backwards?
A	okay
B	yeah
A	look at the signs  Apple blossom day
B	when's apple blossom day then?
A	dunno
B	oh it's like a
A	fish?
B	oh well maybe here
A	alright
B	ring the bottle and you get a fish
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	yeah you haven't been allowed those in ages have you?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	but there was er
A	mm
B	I didn't think they were mistreated though
A	pet shop
B	just as long as you carry it home gently
A	yeah but you go to a pet shop with the sole intention of buying a fish
B	and looking after it
A	whereas if you go to a fair you might just be going for a laugh
B	and then you've got a fish and no tank
A	and then you've got a fish and you don't want it
A	you're just gonna flush it down the loo or something
B	yeah I suppose
A	mm
B	oh
B	lost
A	yeah
B	there's a  there's a  boy up in Scotland
B	how can people forget?
A	I don't know
B	people forget
A	I know there's millions isn't there
B	yeah
B	mm it's easy enough to do
A	yeah
B	I've bought lottery tickets before and forgotten I've bought them and then
A	yeah
B	but I usually find them and I've got nothing on them anyway
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I hope the microphone doesn't er pick up all the wind
B	yeah
A	have to listen to it when we get back
B	yeah my hands are cold
A	what does that do?
B	it's different to the walnuts that we eat
A	black walnuts?
B	they help
A	reinforces the enamel?
B	yeah
A	hm
B	ferret
A	it looks like a
B	ferret
A	it's pretty squished isn't it
B	oh don't look at it
A	it looks like a meercat
B	I suppose meercats are similar to ferrets
A	yeah
B	they're big now
A	yeah
B	they grow so fast
A	that's cos he heard me say they're ready to eat
A	I've just entered a competition
B	yeah
A	it had
B	sheep?
A	no man dressed as a
B	oh right
A	my caption was
B	does he do anything with the rabbit or he's just standing
A	no he's just standing there
B	Obama's bunny
A	talking at the microphone
B	erm
A	what was it?
B	what the rabbit is in the
A	no no
A	not sophisticated but
A	it was funny though
B	well it sounds like it might have been funny if you could remember it
B	what so what d'you win?
A	I dunno
B	White rabbit costume
B	Obama gets the wrong idea when he's told to get  to get  a white hair
A	no I had I wrote it
B	right
A	so yeah I've just about recovered from yesterday
B	yesterday? Why
A	yeah
B	oh beers
A	well from beers in the afternoon
A	seriously can't do it
B	I only had a few pints and I was
A	oh dear
B	you had a nap
A	well yeah I had to
B	yeah that's not good
A	we'll have to be very careful when the er for the party
B	yeah I know I was thinking about that
A	not gonna start drinking til the sun goes down
B	no I was thinking I need to stay away from the beer altogether
A	yeah
B	and drink something else
A	yeah
B	I need
A	I know
B	Cos the last thing you want is to feel drained or
A	yeah
B	I was talking to
A	yeah
B	but oh we
A	well it's not a problem is it
B	well it is cos it you've got to have enough food for everybody
A	yeah
B	it's
A	just something to do
B	oh and
A	yeah
B	and I've never even tried to make them
A	yeah
B	so said make some samosas and put them in the freezer and then see if they work quite well heating them up from the freezer
A	oh okay and yeah
B	and then
A	that's a good idea
B	then we can make batches now
A	yeah
B	and put them all in the freezer ready
A	save panicking at the end
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm going after zumba I'm going a with Mum to Dereham
A	yep
B	so we need to work out how many we want
A	yeah
B	and er what colours
A	yeah
B	so mainly red but I think a couple of white ones might be quite nice somewhere
A	yeah
B	or do you want all red?
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	quite nice
B	so shall I go for all red?
A	yeah
B	no
A	cos they're not that powerful are they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and um and work out which ones
A	yeah
B	we need them now cos otherwise we will panic
A	yeah
B	and they might go up in price over the summer cos everybody will be having barbeques and stuff
A	yeah and I was thinking we need to plan like the actual day what time things are gonna happen
B	yeah
A	Cos I need to make the playlists for the music
B	yeah
A	for different periods
B	yeah
A	music played before the band
B	are you gonna put them all on
A	and then er after the band
B	if you put them all on separate CDs like dinner music
A	yeah
B	and then
A	but we need to think what kind of atmosphere we wanna create
B	yeah
A	in those times
B	and then I need a salsa section
A	salsa?
B	just like
A	yeah well that's the thing it's gonna be difficult mixing the genres
B	well
B	the salsa section
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the programme I've got doesn't do it
B	that that
A	mixing?
B	A scratch mixer
A	yeah
B	and then it's got these turntables
A	yeah
B	and you don't have to have a um er record on them or anything
A	oh I've got  I've got  like a virtual DJ
B	oh no it's a real one
A	huh? Oh he's got a real one
B	A real one
A	oh okay
B	and it's it's a fake
A	oh you can record it yeah?
B	I guess so
A	Cos I don't want to be doing it on the night
B	no
A	the trouble is though you need
B	yeah
A	that's the problem I've got cos we've only go the one sound card
B	yeah
A	when you try and mix it's just guessing
B	yes you
A	you haven't got the the distinction between the two outputs
B	well I think he's I think that's what he does
A	okay
B	sO we've got to speak to
A	alright
B	oh we're going to their house on Saturday
A	yeah
B	for the barbeque
A	okay we'll try and nick it then
B	maybe er if I call him up and say and check with him
A	yeah
B	or you could call him up check with him
A	yeah
B	so that we can have a play
A	okay
B	and then he can show you how it all works and
A	well I know how it works
B	I know  I know  you know how it works but ah you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	it he's been using it well he's been playing with it for a while
A	well it's just
B	well phone him up and find out
A	it's gonna  it's gonna  take ages cos I'm not the world's greatest mixer
B	on top of it
A	on top of that
B	like yeah
A	and then use that file and keep going like that
B	no
A	so it's gonna take bloody ages
B	yeah
A	plus we need to find a
B	well you never know maybe he he might let us if we have play with it on Saturday and if it works maybe he'll lend it to us for a week
A	yeah
B	it would be good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	into different kind of sections now
B	so if if you have time this week before Saturday to like put the songs in the order kind of that you want
A	well I haven't got to that stage
B	yeah
A	like dinner music or
B	yeah
A	building creating a party atmosphere kind of music or
B	looking at the audience
A	they can
B	yeah
A	put music to suit that
B	no
A	so we're gonna have to try and create the atmosphere through the music
B	yeah but then you've got the whole section
A	yeah
B	so they they're gonna do that part so that will be a nice change of
A	yeah
B	they'll be reading the  they'll be reading the
A	well I dunno I think
B	what goes best
A	yeah but before like the first and second set they're gonna be playing just stuff from the iPod
B	yeah in between
A	yeah
B	but shouldn't you just let them do it do what they want
A	yeah but I mean they might have a load of shit on there
B	hm
A	I don't know if I'd rather have control of that as well
B	hm
A	and say look between your sets could you just stick this CD on
B	maybe that's when we could have a salsa section
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well not rocky rocky but you know things like The Strokes and White Stripes and that kinda stuff
B	okay
A	um
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you think or do you think we be too busy yapping and socialising to do that
A	well that's it probably I mean
B	couldn't we just go wahay can you put the salsa CD on?
A	yeah
B	maybe we could do that
A	yeah
B	or
A	what just create a whole stack of CDs and then
B	yeah
A	I don't know if we would have time
B	mm
A	yeah
A	that kind of thing to think about
B	mm
A	yeah
B	like the food and stuff it's like we've got to delegate some people
A	which way d'you want to go?
B	Down here
A	yeah
B	and say to Uncle Brian Could you do us a favour? Could you
A	yeah
B	but that
A	no
B	we're gonna have to think about it
A	yeah
B	you're welcome to come
A	yeah
B	what and suddenly say Oh I can't come
B	no
A	yeah well it happens though doesn't it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	if it all
A	no it'll be fine
B	yeah I know but
A	ah the main problem is the weather
B	oh I have
A	what?
B	I ordered flooring for the marquee
A	have you?
B	and I didn't tell anybody
A	what?
B	because it was like thirty quid or something and I just thought well wouldn't that be better
A	well okay
B	you can cancel it if you like
A	no well we need a stage as well don't we?
B	ah yeah
A	no the flooring will
B	if we've got the flooring the stage isn't that important is it? Cos they can stand just on the floor
A	yeah I suppose
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	I didn't mean to it just kind of like when I was ticking the boxes and I just thought
A	what the hell is that?
B	and I
A	what was it?
B	no seriously is that alright cos we if you  if you  don't want it I'll cancel it
A	well
B	I think it was thirty pounds
A	well that's okay then
B	but I just thought
A	yeah well it would be better for my brother's wheelchair
B	maybe
A	and if it's raining then it'll just turn into
B	there's
A	like a Glastonbury mud fest
B	yeah
A	so
B	well there's your brother in the wheelchair and there's people who have got sticks and stuff
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it kind of moulds to the shape of the earth
A	yeah
B	sorry
B	this way
A	are we going for the long one?
B	well we can always cancel it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and are they one's where you can wash your hands?
B	yep
A	okay
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	I'll have to check
A	no
B	I hope not  hope not
A	I hope not as well cos
B	Cos if everybody's camping
A	yeah they need
B	they need a sink
A	yeah
B	I'm sure I emailed and said Does it have a vanity section?
A	yeah well he knows
B	yeah
A	but I know it's not the same guy who's doing the toilets is it? He's just kind of acting as a go between
B	yeah and I wonder if we can
A	so just as long as he relays the message to him
B	we might be able to
A	yeah
B	so that there's an extra mirror just for people walking past to like just check they haven't got black eyes or something
A	yeah
B	and the men
A	yeah
B	right yeah I think I've got to that
A	yeah
B	Cos both the marquee and the band want their payments the rest
A	upfront
B	the rest of the payments once they arrive
A	yeah
B	so
A	well I'll
B	that's gonna be a lot of cash
A	I'll have another look at the um the invoice for the band
B	mm mm
A	Cos I haven't looked at it since we ordered
B	no
A	I don't know if it's got a er deadline on it
B	oh
B	no I thought it said pay on the day
A	well I can't remember
A	so I need to look at that
B	yeah
A	so it doesn't hit us all in one big whack
B	yeah
A	Cos it's quite a lot of money
B	yeah
A	if you do it every month you won't notice so much will you
B	no
A	yeah but coming out your bank account it's not gonna change it drastically overall
B	yeah
A	well cos then you can't
B	too many jobs to do really
A	I know cos once we start this
B	and what if we do go away?
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	Cos we're gonna have a new country and new culture new job trying to find a new house
B	yeah
A	we're not gonna have much time to think about this
B	that's why I wanted to go to
A	mm mm
B	even if it's not the perfect deal which I was going round trying to find the perfect perfect deal
A	mm
B	you know it's like a pound out or two pounds out
A	yeah
B	I was gonna do some digging
A	mm
B	er the wind's blowing the other way
A	this walk's quite deceiving isn't it cos it feels like we've walked a lot further than half way
B	weh have
A	we're not
B	yeah
A	and guess how long we've been going for
B	I don't know
A	no
B	what?
A	twenty-eight
B	oh
A	no this bit's a lot longer than you think
B	well it's not gonna take us twenty minutes is it?
A	well it's gonna take us fifteen minutes
B	mm
A	are we having a roast dinner today?
B	mm mm
A	yeah?
B	and batter puddings
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	ooh
B	apart from I don't
A	yeah
A	that's alright
B	broccoli
A	broccoli
B	it just keeps growing
A	yeah? thirty-nineteen
B	yeah
A	hm
B	and the
B	I don't really understand that
B	oh you know
A	has she?
B	yeah
B	I was like
A	yeah
B	Cos you won't be able to get off
A	well she will do I mean
B	and she went It's in a resort
A	oh yeah that's what she's dong cleaning is she?
B	um a hotel um I don't know hotel service
A	oh wow
B	I said that's beautiful
A	well that's beautiful
B	she said
A	but you are really really stuck
B	yeah but she doesn't like snorkelling
A	well has she been snorkelling?
B	no but she's been to the Red Sea and she never went snorkelling
A	yeah but I don't think you can say you don't like snorkelling unless you've been snorkelling
B	no she doesn't say she didn't like it
A	yeah
B	and you can see all the little fishies
A	she'd love it
A	yeah but those islands you've got  you've got  the main place which is um what is it ?
B	right
A	um that's just a horrible town apparently
B	yeah
A	and they just fly to all the different islands
B	yeah
A	so you'd be stuck on an island which is just a hotel basically
B	yeah
A	with I dunno I imagine it would get on your nerves after a while cos you're just gonna have a load of honeymooning couples
B	yep
A	or just extremely rich people
B	and how high is the Maldives because
A	it's about one metre above sea level
B	they've got that big wall
A	yeah they built this massive wall to protect it from the tsunamis
B	yeah but there's um there's another group of um islands
A	yeah
B	I don't know where they are er
A	there's only
B	islands?
A	I don't know
B	they're not by the Maldives I think but because they're only like one point two metres above sea level they've had to evacuate them all
A	yeah
B	Cos the sea's just been coming in making the islands smaller and smaller
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah I think the wall only
B	that's gonna happen
A	protects the the main bit as well
B	well that's gonna happen to the Maldives though if
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	in the sea
B	one point two metres
A	yeah it is a bit scary isn't it
B	are you sure it is?
A	yeah
B	it must be higher than this the other one
A	no it's
B	where are the  islands?
A	um well it sounds the same kind of place
B	maybe it's some of the Maldives then
A	yeah
B	mm
A	because they're
B	mm
A	so it's gonna be expensive
B	the main island would have lots of culture wouldn't it
A	I don't know
B	it's just the resort islands
A	I don't know cos I did look at it and I dunno
B	ah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	that's what I wouldn't like
B	and yeah if any thing happens there's a lot of people to evacuate isn't there
A	yeah
B	so er I dunno
A	yeah as long as you've got some money you'd be alright
B	yes but the holiday makers
A	well that's unlikely for that to happen
B	yeah
A	the main thing will just be feeling cut off
B	yeah
A	I know it sounds a bit funny being bored in somewhere like that but I think you would
B	oh I nearly walked down there
A	how much was it?
B	ah I don't know
A	has she got an interview or has she just applied to it?
B	she's just applied that's all
A	so she wants to get out then?
B	I think so
A	now she's had a taste
B	and she's had a taste of being abroad
A	yeah
B	yeah and I think  I think  she wants to
A	yeah
B	she can't just up and move because they won't go and find her another house in a different area without some sort of reason
A	yeah
B	so to up and move to another country where they it I mean if her job provides accommodation for her
A	yeah
B	that's a lot easier
A	yeah
B	I think
A	no it's easier for us as well
B	yeah it feels easier
A	it's silly
B	even though we've still got to do the house hunting and all of that
A	yeah
B	it still seems
A	well I dunno all the paperwork
B	mm mm
B	crazy isn't it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that's going to start happening here
B	mm
A	where you know the most intelligent people are just gonna bugger off somewhere else
B	I dunno actually
A	yeah
B	but if the
A	well no I mean intelligence as in kind of um I dunno people who are I dunno innovative
B	yeah
A	the cutting edge of science
B	well a lot of the people who are coming out of uni or doing a masters or something can't actually find work because of all the You should do a voluntary year and not get paid before you start
A	hm
B	how tempting is that to go and work abroad
A	yeah
B	and get the money first
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	to do stuff like that
B	but when when they have brain draining and people go over and stud abroad or work abroad then it's more likely that they're gonna get experience now
A	yeah
B	rather than stay here
A	yeah
B	so those countries won't be losing
A	yeah
B	as many intelligent people
A	yeah
B	which is what they're supposed to do anyway
A	well they're supposed to but
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	although
B	well
