A	okay this is er session number one for the
A	we shall be creating something that we can make to bring both of us to er the best lifestyle that we enjoy without having the spods at work take over our world
B	we don't even need to mention them
A	no spods
B	they are nothing in fact there is no they
A	okay so from there we will just er today what we wanna try and get out of our session is to er provide a planning platform do some brainstorming about ideas and to try and get something out of
B	yeah
A	if we have time to make one connection there together then that's useful but erm if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen but the idea is that at least so
B	mm I'd agree with that
A	erm so
B	can you see if my eyes are closed or open?
A	I can see that they're closed
B	oh that's good cos I'm listening too
A	that's fine erm so er part of that I can use as a tool in the short term to try and get something going erm that brings in er a small income stream but maybe on a consistent basis erm so there's a consideration of whether it's worthwhile putting the time in to do that erm which I think it is because it's it's er just to have something that's kind of trickling away without occupying too much time erm and then from there er use the rest of the time to build what is a bigger plan for the future and stuff like that
B	mm
A	so if I can find a mechanism or mechanisms to erm er put in plan something that can be outsourced to Asia
B	oh yeah?
A	then erm the part of the purpose of the journey would therefore be meeting some people who can assist me in that
B	yeah
A	or at least provide me er an understanding of connections of culture or how it can work without putting too much effort in
B	yeah
A	erm and something that's reliable et cetera so that would be one part of the remit of the
B	mm
A	and the other part would be to erm er to employ my time as best as I can to bring together some ideas for what we might want to do
B	mm
A	erm
B	well what what is it in the what
A	well erm the the small side of it is that there are erm things that I could spend maybe maybe erm probably a week developing erm through some of what the Location Rebel has to offer so there are income streams
B	mm
A	and that could be outsourcing erm particular writing topics et cetera that
B	yeah
A	so it's simply finding somebody who's a good writer erm getting them to write some content and being the go-between erm to front the
B	right
A	erm so that's one idea another idea is from the
B	right
A	and so you just go to a client and you say erm give us five hundred images we'll clear-cut them in a certain amount of time for a certain amount of money
B	right
A	erm and the idea would to be competitive would be able to turn it around at a very quick rate so if you've got a reliable person who can actually chew through this stuff effectively erm in theory in a day if they did a half day's work erm you'd be looking at erm one every four minutes so that's fifteen so four hours fifteen so you'd be doing sixty and a half days so you might actually employ more than one person to do larger quantity
B	right
A	sixty and one half day so a hundred and twenty a day but you really need to try and have that er probably at a higher level so you might have some outfits you want to have five hundred done overnight so if you can do something that's connected to a time zone where you're effectively getting twenty-four hour working out of a day
B	yeah
A	so you'd outsource it to one place in one particular country and another place in another country so you can send it out at a particular time of the day in such that it comes back in one day and all of that stuff's done
B	right
A	yeah? erm so that's one idea erm another idea is is web design effectively and that's a longer process erm that can be done under a variety of platforms and erm er one could employ a graphic designer and a web developer to do this stuff for you and you've just gotta communicate the ideas to them from your client and you you maintain the interface with your client to make sure that they're happy with what they're getting yeah? so I think I've got er er a small enough er awareness of of you know if you keep it simple that you can define these things such that for a particular price you get this product
B	okay and what I'd make a before you go and I don't know how erm
A	in in what?
B	and he is setting up his own well you'll just have to find out but I mean he's a businessman
A	yes
B	he's been a businessman for all of his life
A	yes
B	and he sets up businesses now willy-nilly
A	right
B	so I would I would er talk to someone who knows what the fuck business is about
A	mm
B	before you go and do any of this
A	yes
A	right
B	cos they'll shape your ideas into something that I think seems a bit more streamlined
A	yes erm I mean I'm just poking out ideas there I expect that it's a very competitive type of market
B	mm
A	but what you get is you get people who do it as as purists they they are web developers
B	yeah
A	they do er people who do it on Wordpress say they do Word
B	yeah
A	and what you do is you just say five hundred you get this product for five thousand you get this product
B	yeah
A	erm and there are many many people who do that erm and that is actually from my point of view the quickest and easiest way to produce something
B	okay
A	because it's basically take a template plug stuff in
B	yeah
A	and adapt that to the content that somebody needs you know
B	yeah and what another thing is is that you know you've got a certain framework in your head about what you've just mentioned but also when you
A	mm
B	an almost pan-Asian er overview
A	outlook yeah
B	he'll be able to tell you where the real action's going on and whether you're somehow aligning yourself with a bigger kind of you know business growth area erm and er and you know he might just turn round and say yeah you're in the right area if you forge ahead with some of these ideas
A	yeah
B	but he'll be er I think you know he's a he's a real businessman he's really setting up businesses right now
A	yeah my my in what's in my head is erm that I er that I accept that some of this might not actually go into any particular growth but what it er provides is a short-term measure to bring a short short-term income minimum
B	yeah yeah
A	that er that also allows you the freedom and time to build the stuff that you need
B	yeah but it's good for you to know whether you're on a if er
A	if you're on a trail that's worthwhile following
B	yeah
A	yes of course
B	cos you might just go okay I'll do this for a
A	yeah yeah
B	but I also want to know where the real growth is gonna be happening
A	yeah
B	I want to know where it is even if I'm not actually going to be anywhere near it in terms of developing but I know I wanna know where the power is coming from these countries
A	mm
B	cos if you need to go and talk to people in foreign countries you need to know exactly where to go
A	and erm whatever
B	and get access to them
A	yes
B	that's why you need people who know how to get access to people
A	yes
B	fixers
A	mm mm yes exactly
B	like you know for example erm
A	erm
B	in Indonesia
B	could you go and meet him?
A	yeah but he'll be in Jakarta
B	oh well
A	erm er well I mean there's nothing stopping me making that diversion but
B	if you could understand why you'd meet him
A	you you have to just weigh up weigh up the the the benefits of doing so that's all
B	well you'd actually have to sell it to him that he'd wanna meet you
A	yes of course now there
B	yeah
A	so we can go into that detail a bit later
B	okay
A	but erm okay so then there's there's him but er and and you know there is the context that some of these are people who have worked in Asia have built some connections in some context and to understand the different points of view helps you knowing where I'll go in under there rather than up there or
B	mm
A	around that way or that way or whatever
B	true exactly it's looking to say I want a map
A	mm
B	I want a sort of decent one to start off with
A	mm
B	you're just gonna get some map some people gonna help you then locate you on the map
A	yes
B	and then you're going to take the map and figure out for yourself where you
A	yes exactly
B	you need a decent enough map as you'll get lost in it
A	for sure and and some of these people who are in Location Rebel who have been based in Asia doing work or the other outfits all have some connection and some manner
B	yeah
A	that they've done
B	yeah
A	and some some of these guys live in China and
B	mm
A	and do manufacturing in China for instance you know erm
B	well yeah and I'd say they're second tier because even though you're in a community of
B	mm
A	erm er one of those things an action would be to erm strike a list of those people
B	yeah
A	and contact them and even if it's just a telephone discussion to say
B	well I'm sure
A	right
B	and apparently
A	well that's what she thinks
B	well that's what she says
A	mm
B	but anyway it doesn't matter the point is you're both in the
A	yes
B	you've got a wife who goes to work nine to five
A	mm
A	yeah
B	so yes you can meet for a drink
A	mm
B	cos he's quite happy to
A	mm
B	have a chat
A	oh okay
B	and he's got his own thing going on so he might even wanna run some ideas past you who knows?
A	mm see how it goes
B	yeah
A	yeah okay erm so as I said so action one is to er list er contacts in Asia in Asia or with Asia
B	I mean if you if you were cool that when we went to Burma for example erm we got to see how effectively how businesses were being run we were just there as tourists
A	yes
B	but you know if you had a contact in
A	yeah
B	and I want you want this guy to show you our business
A	mm
B	how we operate
A	mm mm
B	you just go yeah
A	mm
B	even if he isn't in your direct line of interest
A	no absolutely because you might find it quite interesting
B	because culturally you'll pick up on how business gets done
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so it's all gonna be a bit of you know experiential learning through culture and being open-minded and it'll be some of it'll be directed targeted to what you think you know will get you
A	and and some of it you might see some other benefit out of having experienced it anyway
B	yeah but it means that if you're not too focused on the
A	mm
B	we're building a factory of some kind you know
A	yeah mm
B	and you can go yeah alright yeah I'll come along
A	mm
B	okay
A	exactly and you get the opportunity to spend time and talk to people about whatever
B	yeah and I would really say that you're a project manager when you go to Asia
A	yes
B	I would just keep it simple
A	mm yes exactly erm your your bang on the
B	mm
A	and and and work on
B	mm
A	over a period of time
B	mm
A	to try and build some relationships
B	exactly and the other thing that you know you know by moving from here to another country meaning moving temporarily shifting the foci is all those Location Rebel people and many others they've become a different person from basically shifting er
A	mm
B	that's a real common powerful theme and I think what you're doing is you're trending in that way you're trending by saying I'm going to see you know if that could work for me erm and I'm going to just you know hook up with a few people and and just keep talking all the time about what people are doing
A	mm
B	asking lots of questions
A	mm yes exactly
B	and you'll stumble upon something if you just keep looking as a detective you're just like I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for but I know that if I keep on talking to lots of people somebody will say something which just strikes a chord with you straight away and you're like
A	yes exactly yes
B	mm
A	erm so so
B	mm
A	to to to
B	mm
A	you know I'm thinking third place
B	yeah
A	or second place I mean if you arrive in Singapore you've got to at least stay overnight you can argue that the next day you can meet somebody and then fly out in the afternoon to somewhere else
B	yeah
A	and and then you're not spending all your money in Singapore
B	mm
A	which is an expensive place
B	mm
A	and I would prefer it was that way
B	mm
A	erm and
B	mm
A	you know but er our mate
B	what does that mean?
A	erm give you yeah
B	oh right
A	erm and Indonesia er and the Philippines were the two that
B	mm
A	whereas my discussion with
A	she was quite negative she was negative about the context and the concept of erm trying to work in with these countries and people in these countries were were at a higher level and er erm that that involves some kind of er government approval
B	what evidence did she have to back up support what she was saying?
A	erm er she er well what she what she said in the first place is a lot of these countries aren't democracies that quite often in order to do things you need some kind of approval at some level some authoritative level erm an example would've been being a foreigner living and staying in Vietnam she had to register well her landlord had to register the fact that a foreigner was living in his place with the police
B	mm
A	yeah as an example and she said well from her point of view she was lucky because she never had a visit from the police
B	yeah
A	but that all relied on the idea that she was trusting somebody else to to to to sort that out
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah well that's
A	so then you know and and
B	very Vietnamese
A	how whatever the mechanism is
B	yeah
A	and she said
B	yeah
A	however she was aware that others had
B	yeah
A	so erm her opinion was in order to try and facilitate something happening it could take you years
B	yeah
A	because of red tape
B	yeah
A	right? erm and one of her her direct observations was that
B	yeah
A	yeah? that you won't benefit necessarily unless you have very good partnerships
B	yeah
A	so what you could argue is that a good partnership would be with somebody who lives in Asia
B	yeah
A	so they are the facilitator for that
B	mm
A	kind of thing so I er I don't know that
B	somebody somebody you can trust
A	who has an interest in what you're doing and somebody that you can trust
B	yeah
A	and and he's got all of the the right things in the box straight away without actually having to talk to him erm and another way to look at it is that you know there are Asian people who work in the Location Rebel society
B	mm
A	who erm who who could for their own reasons have that kind of outlook too
B	buddy up
A	you could buddy up
B	mm
A	you could say and I'm very tempted to say sometimes
B	yeah
A	a collaborative kind of I don't know that I would work er
B	mm
A	as a business strength get some money in collectively
B	mm
A	so then and the power of two or three get you a share a lot quicker
B	yeah
A	and the scale of it a lot quicker as well
B	and you're gonna wanna have fun doing it
A	yeah
B	you're gonna have to wanna work with somebody who you know genuinely interests you and you feel that can grow you know in the right direction cos you know
A	he yeah he might wanna do something totally different but
B	well but that's the exploration you take
A	mm
B	you know you go somewhere so far
A	yeah
B	and then you sort of say right well is this somewhere where we can go? look at what happened with
A	yes
B	generally interested in her as a person she must've felt the same way at one point
B	but then you know she she wanted to go in one direction I wanna go in the other
A	exactly
B	and that was it
A	and that's it and that and that's that's that's alright that's fine
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	at the early stage such that the others can carry on and do whatever they want
B	mm
A	and you can pick up and go on er off in your own direction
B	yeah quite hard to do that but yeah yeah
A	so you you can manage that without too much pain and suffering
B	yeah
A	and erm with without having to go to
B	well if you both learn each other's ropes then that's sustainable but if you keep one the one person doing one role and the other one doing the other role
A	er of course
B	then you you'll
A	and and you
B	yeah
A	erm and if you're collectively learning stuff together that's really good
B	yeah
A	because you're both able to say well you learn this but I learn that but we'll teach each other
B	yeah
A	and it's so much more effective and
B	yeah
A	and and quicker to do stuff
B	yeah and I also wouldn't be put off by people like
A	no no no of
B	they've got no interest in doing that type of work
A	no no I I I realise that
B	erm
A	and and and the reality is you're gonna have naysayers
B	you
A	yeah
B	ripped off anywhere
A	mm
B	yes of course if you are erm in walking into a corrupt country where corruption is the way it gets done erm then you have to learn to either live with it put up shut up and just work the system or or fuck off and go somewhere else
A	or
B	where you can it's more er more appropriate to you culturally but yeah it depends on how how you stomach those kind of
A	mm mm yeah and and I think erm er having an open discussion about these this kind of idea with
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and er they were they've probably over time built up the right relationships but they still say they come across difficult people who try to bury them in the ground who who who stagnate and and and try to stalemate them
B	mm
A	to the point where they wanna give up
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	so he survives that because of his sheer-minded you know sheer-mindedness which is good er that's why he succeeds
B	mm
A	because he is like that he's belligerent erm but I think that there's maybe a few things to learn out of respective countries with that as well and I would very much like to learn to be able to cherry-pick straight off I I work in these places but not those places
B	yeah
A	and say that's where I'm gonna focus the energy
B	yeah
A	and leave it at that
B	yeah
A	erm and there are examples
B	have you heard much about Taiwan? can you fly to Taiwan?
A	well I'm sure you can fly anywhere
B	Taipei from Singapore
A	yeah but erm relatively is it?
B	it's pretty cheap living there
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah okay erm
B	I've heard very good things about Taipei from er from
A	yes
B	very good things
A	so if we would just quickly let's just while we're talking about that stuff let's just quickly brainstorm and write a variety of countries yeah? so we've got Taiwan Indonesia and that's only because we have we know somebody and we happen to be going there
B	yeah
A	but don't know what to expect erm
B	that's about it I'd say for now
A	you wouldn't say China?
B	no
A	erm and you wouldn't say any of the other countries which are peripheral at the moment Cambodia
B	mm
A	Laos erm
B	no
A	Singapore
B	yeah
A	er India
B	oh god you wouldn't wanna go there
A	well I have to write it down
B	oh right
A	because it's still a place where a lot of outsourcing happens and a lot of skill bases are
B	yeah
A	and and you're er erm I think you're probably more likely to be able to negotiate er an understanding there because of their their it's just just the English level thing
B	maybe
A	but
B	that's what a lot of people think
A	well and there's a lot of business operations that come out of it
B	there's actually a public lecture on erm coming up this er this week about how to do business in India
A	right okay and where's that?
A	yes please erm now regardless of whether it's India or anything those kind of things flash out useful business knowledge
B	sure I thought we were trying to talk about real reality though of where you might be heading to
A	erm yes that's right so I I wanted to write those down in the bigger picture sense
B	oh okay
A	which is which is these are the feasible places one might be able to go
B	well anywhere's feasible
A	yes
B	so you could actually keep on adding
A	they're the
B	right
A	the er er er an outsourcing or something like that
B	okay
A	yeah
A	if that's the way you want to do it that's fine
A	that in terms of in terms of
B	so where would you go then for these few weeks you're going away?
A	well we know that I think Indonesia Vietnam possibly Philippines possibly
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	yeah? so I don't think I'd write it off but I'd give it a small tick and from what
B	okay
A	they're not very good at business they all like to think they are
B	yeah
A	but they're not good at business
B	yeah they sit around a lot
A	yeah
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	erm Taiwan maybe to a certain it's probably more of a a a Chinese Asian mentality in terms of work
B	mm
A	I don't know really but you know
B	it'll be an interesting comparison for you having been to China and then going to Taiwan it's kind of always always good to see things
B	comparative way
A	the yeah that that kind of thing erm Indonesia erm I'm I I really don't know what kind of fundamental basis apart from people
B	mm
A	I don't think that actually the Indonesian people per se are the ones who are doing the work cos their infrastructure's not good enough
B	right
A	so that's another big thing is the infrastructure
B	yeah
A	so so if you were gonna say infrastructure I imagine you would say Taiwan I've heard Vietnam's good and the Philippines and of course Singapore and er and India
B	so what er
A	yes yeah
B	I thought we'd go down to
A	what? do you want us to go down there and spend money down there do you?
B	well just have something to eat some eggs on toast or something
A	yeah that's gonna be thirty dollars
B	yeah that's true could just go down the shop
A	could go down the shop get something cook it up here
B	okay
A	and then go
B	I'll get the bacon out the fridge
A	we'll go and get
B	yeah
A	yeah you can get the bacon out the fridge throw it in the microwave I'll go down and get some eggs
A	what else do you want?
B	milk
A	eggs milk
B	some some rolls or some bread or something
A	okay er from the dairy?
B	from the dairy? which is the dairy?
A	or or just the newsagent somewhere
B	no the dairy
A	yeah okay alright
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	get a small loaf or something that's not expensive or too expensive
A	just rolls
B	yeah
A	just er either a baguette
B	yeah
A	or a roll
B	yeah something and I'll make
A	or something like that a roll loaf yeah?
B	okay
B	oh you need to do that cos
A	yeah no I agree I'm I'm the same so I think we got to a good point where
B	yeah
A	we started to do some real talk
