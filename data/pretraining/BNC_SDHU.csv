A	to get the strimmer working erm then obviously I'm not I'm gonna be wanting to wear my real scruffy clothes
B	right
A	because you can get oil on you and all sorts of things
B	yes
A	I've already
B	yeah it can happen
A	erm
B	oh
A	things like oil are difficult
B	yes
A	erm so
B	right
A	the milk erm is still in the fridge er there is some juice as well if you want it but otherwise I wouldn't I've held my coffee I haven't had coffee yet
B	okay alright I'll start off with some
A	erm
B	cereal of some sort
A	and oh yes what I didn't say was there's a little bowl with a few strawberries left in it in the fridge if you want to put those on your cereal they could do with using
B	oh oh well
A	I sort of
B	to what sorry?
A	to knit a sleeve
B	oh
A	erm
B	you still haven't finished the sleeve? right
A	mm
A	no once you've got what you want I'll go in there and and make the coffee but
B	wait wait sorry go again
A	I said once you've got what you want I'll go in there and make the coffee but there isn't really room for both of us at the same time
B	yeah right
A	yes erm because I've been using that almond milk
B	oh right
A	which is actually quite nice on cereal I don't know how it cooks though so I would have needed to buy some normal milk anyway because I wanted to use some in cooking
B	mm
A	erm and I don't really want to present you with a failed experiment
A	so finish those strawberries I said
B	yeah
A	no I'll start doing that putting a few strawberries on cereal in the strawberry season and then I sort of gradually realise that it's not
A	but er
B	mm
A	at which point I normally stop buying it
B	yep
A	erm so I don't know where they get their strawberries from at this time of year
B	mm
A	I know actually that the fruit from
B	mm
A	which is just beyond
B	mm
A	whereas anything more local I've gone and it if you plough your way through nettles and thistles to get at the strawberries I just think
B	no no
A	and they've got a lot of places just have strawberries and this place has got a whole range of things
B	mm mm
A	including you know peas and stuff as well erm and I particularly like raspberries they're my favourite fruit erm but their notice said
B	really?
A	which surprised me
B	mm
A	so they obviously just have a whole range of varieties
B	mm mm
A	and plant them at
B	yeah yeah
A	just manage it because it's in their interest
B	mm
A	to have it going as long as possible
B	if you can keep it the season going great
A	mm
B	great of course for them
A	true
A	erm but I've actually been over
B	mm
A	in the café I realised why this year that they've expanded the café since last year
A	slight exaggeration there but you know
A	erm
A	she she's very slow these days
A	erm and and then bought some some things from the shop cos they have stuff that they've picked in the shop as well you know
B	mm mm mm
A	erm
B	no
A	erm there are quite a lot of
B	uhu
A	but this one's in
B	right
A	just in a in a field kinda thing so I mean it's mostly lumps in the grass
B	mm
A	erm but the church is still
B	you need a vivid imagination
A	yeah erm the church is still a building albeit roofless it was used for quite a long time as a parish church
B	mm mm
A	after people had gone from the village itself
A	and presumably not continuously but but every year they'd go and do a season erm so I presume that the grass that you're seeing there now has grown over since they excavated
B	yeah
A	erm and it's a nice day out so
B	and is the history a bit known? you know was it
A	well
B	was it the plague or or did
A	no
B	or was it just economic
A	it was just it it yes er
B	was it a?
A	enclosure the initially the the you know the it was taken over by a new landlord who
B	mm mm
A	for erm sheep farming and and
B	right
A	therefore they didn't need the tenant farmers so much
B	mm mm
A	and that sort of started the decline? and then just the long slow decline I think
B	mm m
A	and it wasn't a sort of
B	mm mm okay
A	erm but because it's a free site there isn't a
B	mm mm yeah
A	but when I went to er
B	right
A	and oh yeah that was one I had this really weird experience with my car that I'd come through
B	mm mm
A	and
B	okay yeah
A	and then just beyond that was some really serious roadworks with a one way traffic light and the traffic was coming through and blocking everything so that
B	yep yep yep
A	erm and I realised also when I finally got beyond the lorry that was in front of me and could see what was happening it was it wasn't a it wasn't a traffic light it was a convoy
B	yep right yep yep yep
A	erm but I was stuck behind something big that I and so I couldn't see past this you always are in those situations
B	yeah right
A	and we were sitting for ages so I switched my engine off
B	mm mm
A	you know and I thought something was gonna fall you know I thought the engine was gonna fall on the floor through through the it was just awful
B	right
A	so I went in there and parked when I set off again nothing at all and the only thing I can think of is I had my windows open cos it was hot but actually it wasn't my engine at all it was somebody else's I was hearing
A	but it was so alarming
A	and I'm driving on thinking well I can't break down here because I'm in the middle of all this one way whatsit and
B	right right yeah
A	it would hold everybody up for hours
B	yeah right
B	yep yeah that'd be fine
A	and are you a milk in coffee person?
B	no
A	no so you're like me black no sugar
B	absolutely
A	right jolly good I'll clear that
B	oh okay
A	well they suggested doing it while you're cooking or something cos it gives you something to do which is all very well but you do move around and you do bang things on the table when you
B	so what what bread is this?
A	er that is wheat
B	oh I see
A	erm
B	uhu
A	and unhomemade blackcurrant and honey and that is quince jelly that my mum gave me that somebody that she knows makes if you see what I mean?
B	what
A	oh and the other
B	which is quince jelly? this
A	that one that's says quince jelly on the side
B	that one oh sorry
A	and that is my marmalade
B	oh
A	which I can recommend
B	I'm sure you can
A	right
B	ah
A	yes I stopped bothering to make raspberry jam because it's very easy
B	yep
A	erm but I was
B	oh I see
B	yeah yeah
A	so that was actually quite good for making jam
A	and as I say
B	pre squashed
A	pre squashed raspberries yes erm but
B	mm
A	you cannot buy even in a farm shop marmalade as nice as that I don't think
B	right
A	I mean see what you think maybe you don't agree it depends what kind of marmalade you like but
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm that's nice marmalade
A	mm that's just Delia
B	mm yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	well that's a bit difficult to gauge because one person's simmer is another person's boil if you see what I mean
B	yeah
A	for for when it's as long as two hours that could make quite a bit of difference
B	yeah
A	to how much water has actually evaporated and therefore to the whole consistency so I would have thought it would vary enormously from year to year but actually doesn't that much
B	it doesn't right
A	there we go so now
B	okay
A	cos I've done it at the right strength for me
B	they are nice mugs aren't they?
A	and yeah and if it isn't I'll put a little bit more water in
B	mm that's fine
A	that's fine? good you're about the only person I know who doesn't go yar when they drink my coffee
B	it's a good solid brew I mean definitely yes but that's fine with me
A	mm
B	right right
B	right yeah yeah it's a pepper pot or whatever isn't it?
A	and it's actually it's yes and it's too narrow to put a spoon into
B	ah
A	you can put a knife in but you couldn't put I erm
B	and did did you say your mother made this?
A	no no
B	no
A	somebody that she knows made it and gave it to her
B	somebody she knows yeah
A	I'm always getting she's well
B	mm right
A	erm you know when we were kids the the
B	ah
A	and she was Italian
B	right
A	so they both spoke fairly broken English
A	managed to have a perfectly good relationship for all those years but erm but she he died quite a long time ago and she'd been continually living next to
B	yeah
A	and she after what
B	mm
A	so she must have been in this country for about fifty-seven years or something like that and she still sounds as if she just arrived off the boat from Naples
A	I mean just so difficult to follow
B	mm
A	really really heavy accent really peculiar grammar and and erm even I found it difficult so and erm you know my mum would sort of sit there smiling and nodding sometimes
A	erm but er she grew oregano in her garden
B	mm mm
A	erm as possibly Italians will you know I don't know
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but obviously far more than she needed so she'd give my mother an enormous polythene bagful of oregano well
B	yeah right right
A	so my mother passes things like that onto me and
B	right
A	erm and tomatoes which I don't mind at all
A	which I have tried to grow but because I tend to go away in June
B	yeah mm mm
A	that's then they
B	right
A	one year I took my tomato plants around and left them in my mother's greenhouse when I was away
A	erm so I've stopped bothering but again
B	yeah yeah
A	they just have so much more flavour than anything from the supermarket
B	yes yeah very good
A	but that's why really why I guess why I want to get my orchard up and running
B	yeah
A	because she's not gonna be around forever and I suspect you know she's got two blackcurrant bushes and I love blackcurrants and I've been going and harvesting from her
B	mm
A	previously er and I did a bit this year but of course I did have a few of my own next year I'm sure I'll have more but I suspect if one of hers dies or something she probably just won't bother to replace it
B	right
A	erm and then of course we don't know how long she's gonna go on for
B	no well well how old is she?
A	eighty-three
B	mm mm
A	erm and I think her mother was something like eighty-seven
B	uhu
A	but she was in a home you know she could really couldn't manage on her own
B	mm mm
A	erm she had she had shingles and was taken into hospital and
B	mm mm
A	and decided that she wasn't fit to live on her own and we were going oh my god because my mother's mother was really really adamant she was not going into anywhere and she had
B	yeah yeah
A	and she was mentally she was absolutely fine but but
B	mm
A	for lunchtime five days a week
B	right right
A	er and a home help who came in I don't know how frequently? and a very nice next door neighbour who was just as old as she was but used to
A	go and knock on her door every day
B	mm
A	so he called an ambulance and she'd actually had a stroke while she was getting undressed the night before and spent the whole night sitting in a chair in her underwear unable to move
B	right
A	and was sort of ended up being rushed to hospital wrapped in foil cos she had hypothermia
B	yeah right right yeah
A	a non central heated bungalow of course
B	of course
A	erm and that was weird as well because it was when I was at school
B	right
A	cos they were faffing about and I heard an ambulance go by along the main road and you can be it's quite a long distance away but it comes up
B	mm
A	the
B	mm
A	and it probably had been cos she had been taken in at about that time
B	that time oh really? mm
A	but well she had her wish in the end
B	mm
A	but you know if she'd lived in a country without all those social services she obviously wouldn't have been able to carry on
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	erm so my dad and his sisters sussed out a few places and took her to look at them and she like oh yeah this is really nice and she
B	oh oh yeah
A	settled in and she used to gossip about the
A	and I don't even mean I don't mean the patients I mean the staff
B	the staff right
A	you know and she found a a gentleman friend
B	mm
A	who used to have a very mild flirtation with over a cup of tea I that
B	ah
A	erm and was perfectly happy so people just are so different
B	yeah yeah
A	but I I know my mother wouldn't
B	no no
A	mm
B	was erm
A	right
B	and
A	mm
B	and she can erm
A	mm
B	what she wants them to but she
A	yes
B	things and she
A	mm
B	which is a big well it's only I could sort of walk it in well
A	mm but it's a big trip for her
B	but for her like that's that's a big trip what I really like about her is that she is determined she is gonna do it and I mean she's not bloody minded when it's been snowing or something
A	mm
B	she she says
A	mm
B	or we can get things for you no no no
A	no oh it's much I if you don't keep doing it
B	yep
A	whereas my auntie
B	mm
A	she's older than my mum and she had she definitely wouldn't go out in snow because she had a bad fall a few years ago
B	mm mm
A	and she was just going from the community centre to back to her little bungalow
B	oh right yeah?
A	erm and went down and broke her wrist and her ankle and it was her right wrist and she's right handed and
B	ah
A	and was in and it has got and when I say broke I mean smithereen kind of broke they had to really pin the ankle
B	yeah right
A	erm and therefore she still although she can now use her hand things like cutting up steak are a little bit tricky
B	yeah
A	she hasn't got the full strength back in it and so
B	right right
A	erm but she's got one of those like a Zimmer but on wheels
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so she can yeah I think it what you were talking about and she insists on going into into Skipton from where she lives which is
B	mm
A	and then getting the bus back cos it's up it's slightly uphill from the
B	okay right fair enough yeah good compromise
A	but again the bus that they had which was one with the that was designed for old people
B	mm
A	and had a really good driver who you know they bloody cancelled
B	yeah
A	so now the bus is coming round at a less convenient time for shopping and it's it doesn't have the the step at the right height
B	right
A	so luckily there's a really nice driver who gets off
B	who jumps out
A	and helps her on with her
B	right yeah
A	but otherwise she wouldn't be able to get into the er shop how's and it's
B	yeah
A	that that bus was full of old people a lot of people just stopped going into town because they can't
B	yes yeah yeah yeah that that's that's
A	but she's got a tame taxi driver
B	uhu
A	er whenever she's going a little bit further afield she just rings him up and says right
A	erm
B	yeah
A	you know and and she's got various allowances and so on because she and and I don't think she's got a lot in the way of savings or anything they ran a shop you know I wouldn't have thought they managed to put a lot away erm and she just thinks it makes sense to use that money on things like like paying for a taxi from time to time to make her life a bit more interesting
B	absolutely absolutely
A	and I just contrast that with my mum who just who just
B	mm
A	and even when she could leave him she felt guilty about doing so you know and er but
B	yeah yeah
A	have sort of blossomed after their husbands died
B	right
A	and my mother was the opposite
B	right right mm
A	I mean even someone like someone called
B	mm
A	forties perhaps
B	oh right yeah
A	certainly not more than fifties so a long time ago she's now found somebody else I mean she's spent a long time mourning
B	mm
A	you know and I think being quite lonely
B	yeah
A	er but er
B	ah
A	which is really nice
B	right great
A	not that I would have expected my mother to go and find somebody else but it would have been nice if she'd taken advantage of things like the theatre
B	yes
A	has a whole lot of women of a certain age involved
A	some of them are widows some of them are not but they just they like doing things
B	right
A	without their husbands from time to
B	right right
A	and so there is a kind of little social group there that she could do things with and they kept inviting her and and she just oh no I don't feel like it
B	oh I don't yeah yeah
A	erm and and now it's oh well I don't think I can leave
B	yes you can yes
A	but there are times when she'll only come out for coffee not lunch because she doesn't want to leave him
unknown_female	hi
A	hello hi
unknown_female	there you go thanks very much
A	yes
B	is this flour?
A	sorry?
B	is this flour?
A	no no no it's a it's a I've got I've ordered two different things online from Amazon
B	right
A	and both of them are potentially small enough to go through the letterbox but it depends how they're packed and I didn't know how they were gonna be packed
B	right
A	erm so
B	right
A	cos it's totally out of sight there
B	right
A	it's waterproof
B	right
A	and I don't want to have to go right into
B	ah but now
A	and now there isn't
B	right
A	erm and it's just such a nuisance and it's a good job that I did that I was in actually because it wouldn't it should have been able to go through the letterbox but they'd packed it square rather than flat if you see what I mean
A	so it would you know Barclaycard why do we get?
B	yeah
A	what a waste and that ditto but at least that is I mean why Barclaycard think I want a Barclaycard I've no idea I've never you know it's not my bank
A	erm at least this is from a company that I have ordered things from but it's the second thing I've had from them in a week
B	yeah yes
A	erm and every time I it's the plant company so it's like I ordered a lot of those plants from them erm but every time you do an order with them you get a free gift that you don't want erm
B	mm mm
A	the current one because I take it to work and I need to be able to put different things in different places and and it's actually quite difficult to find one with all those compartments
B	yeah uhu
A	so I'm not just going to accept any random backpack that's just got one compartment
B	right
A	it's of no use whatsoever
B	right right right
A	I think having said that my kitchen scissors were from them
B	uhu
A	one time I some kitchen scissors and a set of knives
B	ah
A	er which
B	was a peep
A	yeah
B	no
A	very loud I don't think
B	no
A	erm I mean
B	that was that was it ringing?
A	and it's only there
B	yeah
A	yes
B	right
A	erm and with with this new phone there's a base unit and a handset so I can and I do I mean
B	mm yeah
A	thinking if your were
B	right right
A	erm
B	mm
A	erm I mean obviously that's why you have a detachable handset so you can put it in whatever room you're in but then you've got to remember to do it
B	yes
A	erm
B	yeah yeah
A	that's not
B	oh
A	as brilliant as
B	uhu
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	erm I can't remember what actually went wrong with the old phone something did
A	I bought it when I first came back to this country cos I'd had a fax machine in Japan which was really quite good for keeping in touch with mum
B	mm mm
A	cos they had one at that point
B	uhu
A	erm
B	yes
A	but it wasn't as widespread
B	right
A	and a lot of offices were still using faxes
B	yeah
A	and they actually offered to buy me a fax machine erm and
B	mm
A	you know
B	a business yes yeah yeah
B	okay
A	and
B	ah
A	I when I first moved in and I just had a phone with no answerphone and no nothing I was getting faxes coming through in the middle of the night you know which obviously couldn't come through
A	but you've picked the phone the phone would ring and I have no means of switching of doing anything with it because it I didn't have an answerphone yet
B	yeah yeah
A	and I pick it up and all I was getting was this bloody beeping noise
B	yeah yeah
A	and I ended up having to unplug the phone every night and it was so annoying
A	erm
B	yes yes
A	so it was actually quite useful to to get a fax machine so it could actually cope with the faxes that were still coming for somebody else
A	but er I don't I think that's kind of tailed off now
B	and have you had any contact with the old house? with people in
A	no not at all no er I left the new address
B	yeah
A	because I wasn't doing a I wasn't there when they moved in
B	mm
A	erm they were just getting the key from the agent and I was at work so we weren't actually talking and I've never actually met them because the agent showed them round the house
B	oh right
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	but anybody who could do those days the agents did it was much I it was so much less stress with the second agent
B	mm mm
A	erm and that's partly why you know that I just
B	yeah
A	so they didn't even tell me that someone had been viewing until
B	oh
A	erm so as I said I left them a sort of a piece of paper that was saying this key's for that one this key's for that one
B	yeah yeah
A	and erm you know you need to do X Y and Z with a thermostat that sort of you know little things like that
B	right right
A	that I would have said if we'd have been able to do a handover
B	mm
A	but use your judgement about that
B	nothing mm
A	I didn't bother to ask the post office to forward stuff because most of the mail I get is junk
A	erm and what's the point?
B	yeah
A	in forwarding that?
B	yeah
A	as I say I thought I told everyone as it turned out I'd forgotten the doctor
B	uhu
A	as I realised when I went to the doctor's
B	yeah
A	but I have I mean banks and and utility bills
B	yeah yeah
A	and all of those well I don't get those in the post anyway but erm I I had told everybody so
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	but I think I think it's wasteful enough to send stuff like this out in the first place but
B	yeah
A	erm to keep on sending it after ten years
B	right right
A	without just checking that people are still there
A	yeah so my my spy
B	oh right right
B	yeah yeah
A	that counter in the middle
B	yeah
A	that they've pulled that up and and made it all into one big room
B	okay
A	well I can understand that actually because I loved that whole layout and everything and it was great if you were cooking
B	mm
A	people could be sitting at the table and you could be sitting at the table and you could put the food on the counter
B	yep yep yep yep
A	and everything but the dining area was a bit small
B	yeah a bit yeah
A	erm so that's fine if you had two people there and you can manage with four but but the person who went round the far side couldn't get up and go to the loo in the middle of a meal very easily
B	mm well okay yeah
A	erm but if you had any more people than that there it wouldn't have been possible
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	right
A	I can understand why they would decide to do that
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but I think she's been a from her kitchen she can see into their kitchen which is a bit naughty really she shouldn't be doing that but
A	erm she's seen workmen coming and going and sort of
B	oh
A	yeah I think it's a I kept that square of lawn because I think it's quite nice to have a bit of lawn
B	oh I would agree I I think a bit of lawn
A	well I presume that's one reason why they bought the house a lot of houses have have houses at that sort of price probably didn't have much in the way of garden
B	mm
A	and there was enough there to do something with it it's one of the reasons I bought it
B	yeah
A	erm but when I moved in there were three lawns that the front bit where the roses are
B	mm
A	was a lawn and I dug that up
B	oh okay
A	and the side bed was a lawn
B	oh okay
A	and
B	understood
A	erm
B	no
A	it was in shade all day
B	yeah yeah
A	so I just er dug that up as well and and found some shade loving bushes which were relatively little trouble
B	yeah
A	but er no I wouldn't have wanted to have none
B	no no I well as I say I I agree with you but I can see if they really wanted to maximise for growing your own then fair enough
A	mm yeah yes cos you couldn't really do that in the front cos with those terrace well I suppose you could if you had it reterraced some a bit more manageably
B	you probably could but yeah
A	yeah
B	tricky
A	but so it'll be interesting to see how they're getting on with the people who moved into not the other half of my house but next door and over the fence
B	uhu
A	were a young couple who'd only been in about a year and they'd done a lot
B	uhu
A	to the house really a lot you know I mean erm not just new kitchen all new windows and doors and then then they were doing all sorts of things with the garden because
B	mm mm
A	which was quite dodgy to work on I would have thought
B	yeah
A	I don't know why
B	mm
A	which is just before I moved here you know
B	mm yeah
A	erm and she was pottering about weeding she really kept up with the garden god did she keep up with the garden
B	yeah
A	she was never out of it you know
B	oh right
A	erm and I would just have thought it was she she would have felt unsafe on a slope like that
B	mm
A	but obviously not erm but they'd actually had it terraced
B	they have okay
A	well had it done it with help because they were young and fit you know?
B	mm mm mm hm
A	I
B	oh it had?
A	it had been for sale longer than mine
B	yeah
A	erm so whether they'd moved out or not I'm not sure
A	well partly
A	but she was very kind and she was a good neighbour to have
B	mm
A	she watched out
B	right
A	you know and if she'd seen something going on that shouldn't be going on she'd have called the police you know?
B	yeah
A	erm and indeed the guy in the other half of her
B	mm mm
A	and sort of one time when I was cutting my apple tree down I was making a bit of a meal of it cos I had rather an old saw and he called over do you want me to come and do it for you? and I said no
B	well
A	this one's a bit ancient
A	erm which he did
B	mm
A	and and and he there was one day when I'd been you know I was going back to check the house
B	uhu
A	then we're off of course for a few days and and he'd rung the estate agent to tell them that there was a window open
B	oh right good
A	erm so you know they were really
B	that's nice
A	they were good people
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but
B	mm mm
A	erm and they'd been married for fifty-seven years
A	er and don't have kids so
B	mm
A	you know I think she's a little bit lonely
B	yes yeah
A	so I do feel I should keep in touch and I've I've called round a couple of times and I brought her up here to see the house
B	oh that's nice yeah
A	er you know obviously she didn't have transport so I went and fetched her
B	yeah
A	but that's quite a while ago now and you know it's it's just time just goes
A	and and probably for her it's not just going you know she I I doubt if she has enough to do
B	dragging around the yes
A	yeah
A	and actually last time I was supposed to go over
B	right
A	I'd rung her up the week before and said I suddenly realised that it was a bank holiday Monday I'd completely forgotten about it
B	right okay okay
A	which
B	mm
A	kind of thing if you go in as far as
A	er the coffee had been much a better suggestion and in the end I rang her up on the Monday morning to say look
A	yes
B	yeah
A	erm but I don't feel guilty about that I go and see her because I like to talk to her
B	yes yes yes
A	she's you know
B	so
A	have you finished? or have you
B	I have definitely
A	you don't want another thing of coffee or anything?
B	no I'm fine I don't
A	oh right erm
B	so the jobs I know about are
B	er
A	yes
B	and the compost area
A	yes I think that's probably enough don't you? erm
B	a good opening bid as you may say
A	mm yes
B	oh sorry and possibly go and buy or carrying some
A	well yes but that's kind of to do with the compost isn't it?
B	some concrete yep yep
A	erm is I know this sounds really the the living room window sill has got a sort of nasty plastic veneer on it
B	okay
A	so I started removing it and I got part of it off and then the rest of it is so bloody well glued that I can't get it off so I could actually do with some help with that but that's not exactly it's been sitting like that for a year literally so
B	we can certainly
A	that was on my list but
B	put that on the erm
A	so erm so I think it would make sense to look at that er bathroom thing first
B	I would say
A	and then
B	one two three four
A	yes I would say that
B	okay
A	erm so
