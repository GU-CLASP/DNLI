A	yeah
D	derby
A	derby
D	it's er it's pronounced derby
D	yeah
A	did you see the erm the scandal about erm four fourteen thousand fourteen hundred kids in the
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	well the funny thing is right?
D	and so
D	yeah like he believes in all that sort of shit I was like okay grandad that's really interesting I'm gonna eat my turkey now okay bye
D	like
unknown_female	maybe you need to trust him a little bit more
unknown_female	mm
D	and he was like and er he told me that er do you know erm how Jimmy Savile got done for going for loads of little boy er boys' homes and then the owners would let him in and he'd touch them up and stuff?
A	yeah
D	and like hospitals and erm
A	that's so messed up
D	was sort of blackmail for the owner so that if this these people ever grassed this owner up he had them down as being there
unknown_female	wait who's Cliff Richard?
D	he's like a a Christian singer he's like erm he he's like a crooner like
A	yeah
D	do you know like erm?
unknown_female	I recognise the name
D	he's sings a lot of
A	you'll recognise the face
D	he sings a lot of Christian songs like erm merry Christmas songs and stuff like that like Jesus the Saviour
D	he's like an old old man but like old people love him
A	yeah
D	but he's not he's not really like a young person's man is he?
A	no
D	do you know who he is?
A	I know who he is but like I couldn't tell you what he I know he's a singer but that's about
D	yeah like
A	like
D	in the eighties he were really popular like he used to sing like really jazzy stuff
unknown_female	oh okay
D	and then like
unknown_female	oh that's why I know the name then
D	in recent years in recent years he's sort of become like a crooner for Christianity and stuff
A	okay
D	does that make sense?
A	so is he definitely?
unknown_female	another one Jimmy Savile Rolf Harris
A	it's all coming out ain't it?
D	yeah well
D	the funny thing is like my grandad told me that erm Cliff Richard basically got himself a nationality in a different country so that if these allegations ever came out he could never be extradited and I were like
A	what?
D	oh that's bullshit and then when this came out in the paper the other day about erm him being like the them searching his home and stuff I had google I wikipediaed him and he's er he's actually like erm a Barbados national
A	yeah
D	everything that my grandad was saying were true
A	yeah that's really messed up
D	so do you want a cigarette?
unknown_female	erm I'll have one for when I get back
D	yeah
unknown_female	I'm just gonna help him carry the erm duvets and stuff
D	do you want me to help or?
unknown_female	no no no don't worry
D	okay good
A	but the like
D	cos I don't want to
D	yeah
A	and he said like the South Yorkshire Police have always been like arseholes like
D	yeah they are
A	they they always kind of classified people as like I think something
D	yeah
A	accident and all the rest of it
D	the disaster yeah
A	and and it's like really messed up cos they were interviewing
D	yeah
A	and it
D	Rotherham?
A	that's the one
D	yeah
A	and they were interviewing this woman and obviously she didn't you know she wasn't showing her face cos of you know privacy reasons
D	yeah
A	erm and she was like er saying what happened to her and she was like yeah I went to the police and stuff I went to see them again they said they'd lost the evidence and it kind of makes you think well were the police in on it? cos fourteen hundred that's not nothing like
D	no
A	that's messed up
D	like and the thing is like with the I got beat up once by a police officer
A	seriously?
D	erm I was seventeen and I'd just it were my sister's birthday so erm
A	thank you
D	I'd taken her to the cinema
A	mm
D	so I took her to the cinema and we we got erm the bus back into town cos you had to go like twenty minutes out of town to the something called the
A	oh god
D	broke up with him recently so I pushed him like away from me the coppers walked round the corner saw me pushing him and just assumed that I were pissed because I were in the area that I were in walking to a taxi rank
A	yeah
D	they assumed that I were pissed and that like all this other shit so they arrested me and I was just like look breathalyse me I am not pissed like fucking hell seriously and they were just like no no
A	what?
D	and this woman like cos I I
A	fucking hell
D	like
A	that's messed up
D	hi
D	nice to see you
unknown_female	thank you
D	are you okay?
D	yeah and that's like South Yorkshire Police they do it all the time
A	yeah
D	like and I weren't even drunk I were
A	yeah
D	the cinema and like
D	hi
A	it's like my erm
A	one of my friends who's er
A	American friend obviously there's a lot of erm racism
D	police brutality
A	with the police over there and she said cos she lives in quite a dodgy neighbourhood and she said some of her friends would literally cos they have quotas so they would literally stop her black friends and like search them but be really like aggressive towards them for like no reason and it was just
D	yeah
A	messed up so it's kind of good that now it's coming to light and
D	mm
A	hopefully but I think the main guy doesn't wanna move out or whatever so
D	yeah but the thing is like it really pisses me off er why has it taken so long for it to come out?
A	yeah
D	why has it taken fifty years? like
A	mm
D	forty years or whatever I mean I know these victims are scared of coming out and stuff but
A	yeah
D	didn't want to speak out but it's like you go to the police and you give them an anonymous confession or you can even ring up from a phone box like
A	mm
D	where you don't live and no one's gonna know it were you
A	yeah
D	but the thing is the information's there the police have got it they can investigate it like if they have a tip that someone is running this big thing with paedophiles and shit then the police will go out and investigate it
A	yeah
D	whether it's anonymous tip or not they've got to by law they've got to do it
A	yeah
D	so I just don't understand how so many people cos there must have been so many people that knew about it and didn't say anything
A	yeah
D	and I don't care how much money someone paid me if
A	yeah
D	I er
A	that's messed up
D	it don't matter how much I would take the money and then I would go and like
D	no but like if they said to you right
A	yeah
D	I'll pay you out or I'm gonna kill you like I'd take the money and then I'd fucking go and
A	yeah
D	grass them up to the police and hand the money over to the police as proof like
A	yeah and the thing is now the people who probably knew and didn't say anything they're probably gonna get in the shit as well anyway so
D	yeah that's even if they're in on any of the records cos now it's so far back there's only paper records they can go by like
A	mm
D	they can't go by hearsay this far back cos it'd be thrown out in court
A	yeah
D	you've got to have solid evidence to
A	yeah
D	to get someone
A	beyond all reasonable doubt
D	yeah like and if you haven't got that then it'll get thrown out in court
A	yeah
D	and it's just wasting money and time
A	yeah it's kind of things like that that make me want to be a lawyer like justice
D	yeah
A	yeah but my dad I think he was saying that erm one of his friends works for like social
D	well you
A	I used to love them
D	the two erm women that were involved in it are from
A	really?
D	in Yorkshire like they were gonna give them his six month their six old baby six month old baby so he could have sex with it
A	yeah
D	like how fucked in your head do you have to be
D	to do that? like
A	yeah cos weren't they fans or something
D	yeah but like it's fucking I dunno
A	yeah
D	Jay Z coming to me and saying I wanna fuck your baby and I'll
D	give you all this money I'd be like no
A	yeah
D	like and I'd report him to the fucking police
A	yeah it's messed up
D	it's fucked up it's like and when like I mean
A	mm
D	what if they have a kid again? like
A	yeah
D	cos they don't have to go to hospital and tell someone they're pregnant they can just carry the term through cos if they know they're gonna get it taken off off them by social services straight away then they just won't tell anyone will they?
A	yeah
D	and then they're free to do it again
A	so do you live in like a good neighbourhood or is it what's it like around where you are?
D	erm well I come from a good neighbourhood somewhere called
A	yeah
D	just old people and like
A	ah
D	it's like really rough a lot of Polish live there and a lot of like
A	yeah
D	not that Polish are social rejects but
A	no but I know what you mean
D	like a lot of people who like don't work steal and all that sort of stuff some guy knocked on my door the other day well I was sat in erm
A	yeah
D	like like just saw him
A	yeah
D	didn't think owt of it and then he went and knocked on this door like across from us and didn't think owt of it and he came along and he said do you know them who live there? and I were like no he's like they're not nice people
D	I'm like what? like he's like well they ordered forty pounds worth of food and stole it I'm like well how did they do that?
A	yeah
D	like how did they steal this food? and like well that house there on the corner where he'd
D	and I was like okay now this house in question I've
A	yeah
D	and it's always that house or like erm
A	yeah
D	and they live opposite me and I'm just like please do not get me involved in this like
D	it's like I rang the police and they're coming now like oh okay then I'm gonna now go now bye
D	cos it was just like if they're gonna do that to you then I live across from them I have to live here
A	yeah
D	like what what are they gonna do?
A	well I'm so glad that I'm not living erm off campus next year cos I was going to at one point but I weren't really sure but around the the area where like most of the students live there's er been like murders and stuff so
D	really?
A	there's a serial killer going round
D	what?
A	yeah and they reckon he's not gonna stop till he's caught because he's really like he killed erm he this guy wasn't like handicapped but he had a car accident so it made him quite slow and stuff
D	yeah
A	and so at six o'clock in the morning in a park I don't know what he was doing there but he like stabbed him like a hundred times or something and then in June a girl who was wearing you like the full erm
D	makeup? burka?
A	burka
D	yeah
A	yeah and erm so they he's killed her at er like ten in the morning
D	so that's quite like
A	right near the
D	that's in the in the middle of daylight
A	and she was a student yeah and then another woman was attempted attack on her while she was running in the evening they've just said like don't go out alone and all this stuff so
D	fuck
A	yeah
D	so that's how long's that been going on for then?
A	I think the first one was in like February I think and then in June and just weird stuff is going on and something really I think it was in July there was like a funeral for er like a baby
D	what?
A	yeah
D	you are fucking joking
A	and it's not even like in an a dodgy area or anything but it's just
D	what uni do you go to again sorry?
A	erm
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	in
D	yeah that's not a dodgy area at all is it really?
A	no like obviously there's a bit of crime here and there but it's gotten quite
D	there's crime everywhere er though ain't there?
A	yeah
D	it don't matter where you go unless you live in like the middle of nowhere
A	yeah
D	yeah but I mean in England
A	so
D	like if you lived on the moors
A	yeah
D	but then again all the moors murders happened there so it don't even matter where you live does it?
A	yeah
D	there's always crime
A	it's like my dad erm in
D	so why did your dad buy stuff there then?
A	he didn't know at first I don't think but like just one of his clients one day was going for her run and this little like Romanian kid tried to snatch her phone off her just the other day
D	see that's that's happening in
A	really?
D	Romanians go on sorry
A	yeah erm
D	yeah cos it'll
A	cos
D	stop it from locking
A	yeah
D	or something
A	so it's just it's a bit of a weird street and there's this always this really fat woman that like sits outside
D	I'm afraid of fat people as well
D	and then but she's just a bit odd you know?
A	yeah
D	and er my little brother's like hiding behind the car and my dad he doesn't he doesn't get hints at all so he was like
D	doesn't understand
A	lovely people but yeah
D	well erm
unknown_female	do you know what the dole means?
A	mm
D	benefits
A	unemployed yeah
D	benefits erm
unknown_female	not I'm not being patronising
A	mm mm mm
D	no it's not it's not
A	no it's fine
D	the same in France though is it?
unknown_female	no cos you we speak English but
A	yeah
unknown_female	there's words that you don't hear
A	I just kind of like assumed it was unemployed benefits
D	yeah benefits yeah
A	yeah
D	well you can be on benefits and then you can be on the dole if you're on benefits you're on benefits for a short amount of time because you're out of work if you're on the dole you've been on the you're on the on benefits because you don't want to work
A	yeah
D	and it's easy
A	yeah I remember hearing about that
D	Romanians and Bulgarians have been able to come into England and a lot of them have moved to
A	rings a bell
D	it's a very racist party
A	oh yeah
D	yeah
unknown_female	like BNP?
D	yeah like BNP
unknown_female	but like are they worse?
D	EDL? er well
A	there's a lot of those parties in England
unknown_female	it's that and
D	yeah
unknown_female	UKIP as well that's pretty racist
A	but they're not as far right as that right?
unknown_female	no
D	far left or far right
A	yeah
D	it don't matter
unknown_female	they're a bit stupid but
D	they're fucking racist anyway
A	yeah
D	so they did a march through because basically
A	mm
D	or at at a certain time because these Romanians are basically mugging people and playing loud music and just being like completely disrespectful to the area
A	mm
D	because it is a rough area but the
unknown_female	but it's not it's nothing to do with
D	the people
unknown_female	that they're you know their race it's that's what they
D	it's it's their culture
unknown_female	that's their culture yeah
D	it's their culture
A	oh
unknown_female	and it it
D	it's got nothing to do with the race at all
unknown_female	it's not racist it's just you're not very nice people
D	mm the culture is different to ours so like
A	mm that's quite sad
D	and like people with babies and stuff like that daren't walk down the street er in daylight and
A	mm
D	so EDL marched down there and there were riots and it was just a fucking nightmare but it's the same in
A	yeah I heard that
D	have just taken over parts of
A	yeah I remember watching a documentary on it cos obviously there was a whole thing about them coming into the country and stuff and to be fair not all of them are like that cos
D	no not all of them are like that no
A	obviously the students that come over and stuff but it's true that some of them
D	yeah
A	so
unknown_female	yeah
A	it's a shame
unknown_female	well if you think about it this way like
D	cos they were Irish
unknown_female	bars because they're Irish and er it was the same for black people
D	yeah
unknown_female	and people are like no
D	that's skin colour
unknown_female	it's you know just because it's of their skin colour they still Irish people still really really suffered
D	yeah
A	yeah
unknown_female	er like the black people did but just because of your skin colour you're saying that it's nothing compared to like it's really not the same I'm like well it
D	no
unknown_female	but it is
A	yeah
D	yeah it is the same
unknown_female	it's it's still a horrible thing
D	it's still racism
unknown_female	like you can't come in here because you're Irish or you're black
D	yeah
unknown_female	like it's not okay and that always pisses me off I'm like
D	same with gypsies though ain't it
unknown_female	mm
D	but let's face it like
unknown_female	it's it's in their culture
D	yeah it's their culture
A	yeah
unknown_female	but they're not horrible people they've got a lot of good morals and they're
D	yeah they have
unknown_female	they are nice people but some things that I don't agree with they say well we're really good we don't have sex before marriage but then they get married at like fifteen so
D	yeah
A	yeah
unknown_female	well that's probably
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	and the way they treat their wives as well isn't nice
D	awful isn't it?
unknown_female	yeah
D	like
A	mm
unknown_female	but my grandparents like they're Irish but they are they're not they're not racist I wouldn't say that it's a I mean I know it's a generation thing like
A	yeah same with my grandparents
unknown_female	they're not they're not
D	yeah my grandparents are the same
unknown_female	racist but for example I have been told by my my er grandparents and they quite like to wind me up about it just because they know they're quite funny and they know it pisses me off but they have said like I would feel differently if you brought home someone that was black
A	yeah
D	yeah you're just not yeah
unknown_female	but it's not a racist thing I'm just don't find them er particularly
A	yeah like you wouldn't necessarily be attracted to a ginger person or
unknown_female	I can appreciate their beauty but I'm you know
A	blonde or yeah
unknown_female	and they're like they're like yeah but I would be really upset if you did and I'm like but why? I don't understand cos to me there is no difference
A	mm
unknown_female	and they said but obviously I understand because I know it's a generation thing
D	it's a generational thing yeah
unknown_female	and they all say stuff like oh like when they
D	yeah
unknown_female	yeah but you could just say the woman
A	yeah
unknown_female	so like
A	it's
unknown_female	but they know it winds me up it's the same about gay people they have loads of gay friends and stuff erm the younger generation obviously more so but they'll be like oh erm I don't know if it's right they get married in a church I was like nan where does it say in the Bible cos she's quite religious that they can't get married in a church? it's like well it doesn't but it's just not right I'm like but it is like they have every entitlement she's like they have every entitlement I just think it's weird in a church I don't get that
A	I can
unknown_female	but I think we don't understand
A	yeah
unknown_female	because we're not
D	we're not
unknown_female	used to that
D	we we're not we weren't born in that generation
unknown_female	we can't understand it but if
A	yeah
unknown_female	we were
D	we were born
unknown_female	we'd think so differently
A	yeah
D	and erm my
A	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
D	that you're gay like
unknown_female	you know like
D	he just knows and he's just accepted it like he might not like it
unknown_female	we're not gonna love you any less though
unknown_female	yeah
D	no he might not like it but that's his personal opinion he still accepts it and he's still like
A	yeah
D	and er my grandad is like six foot five
D	built like a brick shit house like the scariest looking man you'll ever meet
D	and like he were just like yeah I know you're gay what
A	yeah
D	so? shut up
A	it's like my
D	well that's how they've been brought up
A	yeah and erm
D	that's how they've been brought up with
A	but then my other grandparents they're quite well my grandma's a bit of a hippy like she's always been you know like that
D	yeah
A	so and they went to Africa when there was still the apartheid and stuff like that so they're not really like that they don't really care so
D	yeah yeah
A	it's quite interesting like they're always telling me about when they were in Africa and
A	and she's
A	and in the end you know let him in but
unknown_female	it's nice when someone
A	it's nice hearing about
D	that apartheid the apartheid is so fucking bad ain't it? like just cos of skin colour
A	yeah
D	it's ridiculous
unknown_female	which normally this is the thing for me
D	makes me so angry
unknown_female	I'm
D	like what if it had been the other way round? what if black people had decided
A	yeah
D	well we're black we're better than you
A	yeah
D	cos we're white you know?
unknown_female	how nice is that?
A	that's what I like about my oh
unknown_female	oh I love it so much
A	that's what I like about my uni is that it's really international
D	yeah
A	so it's like there's no racism cos otherwise you're kind of stuffed because you go one and two people won't be speaking English when you walk past them so
D	yeah
unknown_female	who's that?
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	yeah that's what I said
unknown_female	yay it's not an old man
D	how much makeup have you put on?
A	the wine is right in front of you
unknown_female	well I've put a lot on my eyes
unknown_female	I think it looks so nice
A	yeah
D	yeah you look really nice but I'm just wondering how much you've put on
unknown_female	on my eyes I put a lot
D	cos you you look completely different
unknown_female	you were ugly before
D	no you was
A	and it always
