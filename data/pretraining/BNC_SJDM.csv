A	why does it show?
B	so
A	it would be without the discount about seven hundred and fifty
B	mm
A	no each
C	no each
B	oh
A	Cos each of us has the other as a nominated second driver
B	oh is that  is that  why it costs more?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	even though I've got no experience?
C	mm
A	it has been
C	bought this equalisation thing
A	but you could be paying two thousand four thousand pounds
C	two thousand
B	how much?
C	yeah
B	for one person for one year?
A	yeah
C	mm hm
C	as you are much older than that yours won't be as high
A	the risk factor is in young people
C	mm
A	starting to drive
C	they are more likely to have accidents
B	so I doubt whether yours would be anything like that much
B	mm
C	not at all
B	it assimilates new things a lot more quickly and
C	not at all
B	no
A	yes but it that it tends to build confidence where confidence isn't justified
B	true
C	yes but you tend to be a bit more reckless
B	mm
C	young males particularly
B	mm
C	the number of young males who have a an accident within the first twelve months of getting their license is fairly considerable
B	mm
C	but boys certainly don't
B	so why did they
C	because of a silly EU directive
A	em equality
B	but you could argue the equality case for anything
A	yeah
B	that's ageist to charge me more money on a bus just because you know my grandmother could only pays seventy-five P that's ageist
A	yeah
C	no it it is a ridiculous thing
A	when insurance has always been based on statistical probabilities
B	huh
A	the level of risk
B	yup
A	and age is acknowledged as being a significant additional risk
B	youth
A	women's risk rate has been lower than young women's been lower than men's but they are now saying that you can't make that discrimination anymore which is shows how ludicrous discriminatory laws become
C	absolutely it's ridiculous
B	yeah
A	I think there's a
C	well there's a correlation
A	they probably go together on a graph and it becomes a point where um your inexperience um has less effect than your age
B	mm hm
C	it's the old saying a lot of familiarity breeds contempt
B	mm
A	and the young ones are rather more to imbibing
C	yes
A	um reckless quantities of red wine
C	no
B	mm
C	but no you'll be  you'll be  fine
A	I'm amazed the insurers and politicians didn't fight it much more strongly
B	well I guess the insurers don't care because what they lose on the male's paying they'll just add to the female's bills
C	but it won't mean the males will pay any less it just means that females will pay the same
B	really?
C	uh-huh
B	oh they were probably laughing all the way to the bank then that's probably why they didn't fight it
C	mm
A	we don't know if that's the truth
C	to match the men's
B	mm
C	you have to get you know as many sort of quotes you can possibly get because some are more expensive than others
B	mm
C	and it very much depends I suppose on what sort of car you have as well
B	what kind of car would that be?
A	it's eh not a specific kind in terms of make but eh not anything that is high performance not anything that is modified to perform better
C	the smaller engine capacity um tend to be the best ones
A	no
C	no?
A	no
B	that's road tax is it?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	to get the cheapest outcome
B	and what was it I heard about there's some kind of little black box that's being installed into cars that tracks
A	yeah
C	it records the moments before any accident or anything
A	no it's more than that
C	all the times is it?
A	the types the driving style
C	but if you have one of these in the car it pushes your
A	but we I pay less
C	sounds about right
A	em and we get a reduction for that? Sorry are you picking that up on the recording?
B	for for only going  for only going  a certain distance?
C	mm
B	mm
C	well if you for the sake of argument you were working in Oxford and you had a car
B	if you don't pay for parking?
C	no if you do pay for
B	on what?
A	it's a taxable benefit so that's
B	yeah I know but what do they pay you on? What do they charge you tax on?
A	on a notional value of the parking space
A	it's in your
B	how stupid
B	so most of the year?
C	no
B	yeah
C	no
B	well I'm not going to buy one just to keep it in the garage
B	well whether I have a car or not at least I'm using this time
C	mm hm
B	to learn how to drive
C	exactly
B	mm hm
C	so
B	yeah
C	it won't take you long
B	automatic
C	it won't take you long
B	you think so?
C	mm hm
B	was that was it like that for you?
C	I only had ten lessons
B	oooh
B	but did did you go out practicing?
C	no
B	no?
C	oh I'm sorry I drove to
A	in Wales?
C	yes it was South Wales
A	we've never been
C	yes we have
A	oh it wasn't
C	no it wasn't
A	about to run over a man in sandals
C	and suddenly your father shouts clutch and brake
B	what was he saying?
C	clutch and brake
B	oh okay
C	so I stopped the car and I said if you want to drive drive
B	I thought maybe he'd be quite good?
A	I am really
C	yes
B	and said he'd give me one set of instructions
C	yes
B	and then when he actually came to it he said something completely different
C	yes
A	it's intuitive
C	it's it's like him trying to teach me how to use the computer
B	yes
C	to the basics
B	trying being the operative word
C	instead of sticking to the basics only the things I need to know he starts saying um and then if you want to do this you press this that and then when you want to do that you press that and I'm thinking hello? I haven't got the slightest idea what you're talking about
A	mm
C	this is exactly the same reaction
B	I can remember you doing that to me when we were doing maths
C	mm hm
B	okay so to be able to understand how to do this you need to understand how to do that
C	yeah
A	um
C	that's true
A	so ideally with any problem you never start from here
C	no it always ended up in tears if granddad tried to teach me anything in maths
B	he said
C	can't tell
B	and he can never answer but um
C	see how you get on
B	yeah but I mean if I'm not going to go out practicing
A	mm
B	mm
A	if he thinks after ten lessons that you're ready to take you test or he'll say you need a couple more lessons before taking your test
C	mm
A	yes you do
C	yep
A	main test
B	but you can do practice ones on
A	did he mention anything about a theory test?
B	nope
A	yeah
C	you can do practice ones on the computer as well
B	yeah
C	so
B	well it's good that you can actually learn how to drive before you pass your theory test
C	really?
B	yeah which is what put me off doing it for so long
C	really? Oh crikey if that had been me that would have been I'd never learn to drive
B	well it just always put me off
C	yeah
B	I probably would have jumped in a car and learnt how to drive before if had I not had to
C	I didn't realise it was quite as onerous as that in Spain
B	mm
C	and yet their standard of driving is so abysmal
B	is it?
C	oh yes
B	do you notice it? Really?
C	yeah
B	I'd say more the
A	I think that is it's difficult really to make that assessment because the driving that you tend to do when you're abroad is not typical of the driving you'd be doing at home
B	no but when I was in Spain around
A	I'm talking about us
B	oh right to compare
A	your mother's  comparing
C	oh that was
A	when we drove down to
C	dire absolutely dire
A	mm
C	no probably not
A	speeds in inappropriate conditions
C	mm
A	mm
C	but more nervous than here
B	why?
A	oh love
C	now that's not true
A	okay
C	that's my major problem
B	what is it about the way they drive in France that makes you less confident?
C	they were driving much faster than the conditions dictated and doing pulling out and passing in in the most ridiculous places
B	mm
C	really frightening
A	no it's not that many years
B	oh you mean when you went to France the last time?
A	no
B	what
A	yeah
C	yeah I suppose
A	yeah
C	that was about five years ago? Six years ago? Something like that
B	yeah
A	they just discovered today in making the booking for going to Paxos
C	but the um even though it's that long ago since we had the villa and the boat we still get a discount on this year's booking
B	how come?
C	because they consider that a loyalty reward
B	ah
C	even though it was along nearly ten years ago
A	yes
B	so you're going to exactly the same place?
C	it's one of the places that we sailed to from Corfu
B	ah
C	oh and didn't we have a villa on Paxos?
A	yes
C	yes we did
A	yes
C	it was the quaint little place with the outside loo
B	so are you sailing? Doing any sailing?
C	well I'm not
A	no
C	he'll probably hire a motor boat cos you won't be able to keep him off the water
A	unless
C	too bloody expensive
B	who's
A	he's the rigger of the boatyards
C	oh yes
A	and he spends quite large chunks of the summer out in that area in the Ionian area um getting these charter company's boats ready for use and then doing repairs and during season
C	not  surely
A	no
C	nisos
A	no
C	I wonder if
A	yes they are
C	mm
B	where?
A	who knows
C	who knows
B	where is Paxos?
A	do you know where Corfu is?
B	mm hm
A	paxos is a little island seven miles south of Corfu
B	oh
A	A a mere step as your mother would tell you
B	can you fly directly?
A	you fly to Corfu and then get the ferry down to Paxos
B	so you will be doing a little sailing
C	the ferry if it's the eh hydrofoil it's not what you'd call sailing
A	mm
C	no it wasn't it was hydrofoil
A	that's
C	well this one was
A	but
C	no
A	when you went past there
C	nope
A	yeah
C	it was like a bus really
A	they they make an awful noise
C	I don't think this one rattled from what I can remember but it was it didn't take long
A	I can't remember
C	and I was back um you'd set off in the morning to sail back and I was back about the same time as you
A	that was to go from Corfu to Paxos
C	the little one?
A	but the first time yeah
C	yeah
A	we paid extra to have this high speed service
C	that's right
A	yes
C	A bit hard on the back cos it sort of bumped just like you driving
A	yes
C	yes
A	that's where you got your driving practice
C	yeah
B	I think I'm better at steering a car than I am steering a motor boat
C	Good
B	why did you decide to go there in the end?
C	that's a very good question
A	which one?
B	paxos
A	oh Paxos
C	oh Paxos
A	right yes
C	mm
B	why did you decide to go to Paxos?
C	we liked Paxos didn't we?
A	yeah
C	and the time of year there will still be a lot of the flowers and it will still be quite green
B	is it quite pretty?
C	yes in a
A	yes it is
C	yeah
A	mm
C	it's very different to what we call pretty here
A	there are a lot of olive groves so you've got sort of rocky soil with olive trees in and then but also there are a fair amount of other greenery and shrubbery
C	mm
A	I'm not so sure we didn't walk to  on one occasion
C	no we didn't walk to  that was too far
A	Will take me new walking shoes this time
C	or I should just take my trainers as per usual
B	how far was it?
A	mm
C	two three miles?
A	yeah
C	but it was very very pretty
A	mm hm
C	they've still got the the some of the pretty spring flowers
A	and Paxos is a low tourist resort not a not like Corfu which is overwhelmed with tourists
A	mm
C	oh Corfu was vile the last time we went there wasn't much Greek left there
B	mm
C	it was just a giant tourist island
C	urgh
A	it was great to get away
B	when were you not worried about the Greek situation?
A	I was concerned but bearing in mind we're flying with um
C	one of the two
A	um and you're not actually going on to the Greek mainland so if there are air traffic it's less likely to be air traffic than ground staff can problems aside
B	yeah
A	I think Paxos and the other islands are less at risk than the mainland airports
B	oh were you worried about it for strike action?
A	yes
B	oh they'll probably do just do what Spain did
A	mm
C	yep
B	keep the
A	A lot of  A lot of  the islands have no other income at all
C	mm
A	oh yeah
C	all these riots and they said there was really very little
B	well obviously they've been happening
C	yes
B	if if people are rioting they're not gonna be rioting all the time and in all areas of the city
C	yeah
B	it's going to happen in specific places at specific times that
C	but this person indicated that where it was reported that there were real big riots they saw very little
B	well if it's a riot for a couple of hours it's a riot isn't it?
C	it is but it doesn't seem
B	but you never know what whether to trust the newspaper because they're reporting it out of proportion or they're reporting it less because they don't want people to think that the situation is as important or as critical as it is
C	I don't know
A	yeah
C	but you can't
B	yeah
C	and more actually
B	no?
C	nope
B	is there not a Biaritz airport?
A	no there's no airport where you can fly direct from
C	from
A	and that was  And that was  the limitation we put on
B	eh yeah
C	you don't really want to fly into Paris and then have to fly out again
B	no
C	Cos the Gaulle Airport was its signage was abysmal
B	it's like a rabbit warren isn't it?
C	it is
A	probably visited somebody that was living and working there
C	I can't remember
B	and so when are you going?
C	that's the Monday?
A	yes
C	we're going on the Monday
B	for two weeks?
A	yeah
B	super
C	so we don't quite know what the position of the cats will be
B	let's see how things turn out
C	mm
C	mm hm
B	but I'm sure that I mean if
C	I
B	why?
C	because we've got to work out how we deal with yours because we can't leave them out all the time with the food out
A	I I don't think that is yeah
B	oh I don't think that's a problem because one one cat can't get through the cat flap cos it's too fat
A	he it might block it and none of them can get back in
B	and the other one if she hasn't learnt by now how to use it from watching the others use it and I've opened it for her as well and she's gone through
C	I I'm just a bit nervous about leaving them out all day and the fact that our bloody cats eat your cat's food
B	but when you go away on holiday does someone come round and lock your cat in for the night?
A	no
B	so you're cats can go out
C	well we can't really other than
A	doesn't work does it? The the barrier
B	kitchen door
C	mm
B	well they're hardly going to escape are they?
C	no but it's difficult when you've got four of them to try and round up particularly
A	I think the the bigger problem is each eating the others food than
C	no I suppose the only problem is the the food situation
B	what? When?
C	when they come in at night to feed them
B	oh so you do normally do that?
A	we haven't ever asked whoever's looking after them to do that
B	Cos normally you get someone to come in once a day nay?
C	no
A	morning and evening
B	oh okay
C	but
B	or the setting the house alarm
A	mm
C	no
B	mm
C	because there's your cat trays to be done as well
B	yeah but if you're away for two weeks what I can just do is leave four cat trays
C	oh the smell
B	yeah I know but eh
C	mm
B	if I'm in the country I'll just come back at the weekends to sort things out
A	we've got to make provisional arrangements and then sort it out once we know specifically what's happening where you're going to be and
A	we'll see what happens
C	unless
B	the only problem is I think
C	right
B	but again if nobody's here the fact that there are four cat trays sitting there isn't going to inconvenience anybody
C	I think it's better that way because I would hate now to confine your two since they've been used to wandering the house
B	but do you think it's equally fair on your cats to?
C	yes
A	well at least they've got the conservatory and in summer they do spend more time in the conservatory and they'll often sleep overnight in the conservatory
C	and also
A	and they've got the garden
C	yup
A	mm
C	we've shut all the doors so that they've had really only the landing and the hall extra
A	and one bedroom
C	and one bedroom
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	if we shut them in the kitchen they've got plenty of room
B	yeah
C	so I think that's probably the best solution
B	yes
C	they'll survive don't worry
B	I know they will but
A	mm night time though
C	yeah kitchen and conservatory
B	we'll see
C	it'll be difficult because this is the first time we've left the kittens for more than a couple of days
B	they're not really kittens anymore though?
C	no
A	no
C	for that length of time
A	well that's right
C	yeah
A	yes
C	well it was
B	oh they came and lived here?
A	yeah
C	mm hm
A	no
B	somewhere sunny as long as it has sun for you you don't care where it is
A	memorable
C	no
A	no it wasn't anywhere like that
C	no it
B	aw
C	since we went to France
B	when was the last time?
C	when we went to France
B	yeah but when was that?
C	two years ago in June
B	oh yeah yeah um Arcechamp
C	mm hm
B	aw
C	so I've had no sun for two years
B	isn't every summer here not very good?
C	no no
A	yeah
C	we didn't get any at all
B	what plans have you got for the afternoon?
C	absolutely none
B	nothing?
C	nope
B	have you got a lesson?
C	it's the course
B	oh
C	so that's all I've got to do today
B	that one's a busy one there
C	so Wednesday is going to be busy
B	I mean are you still thinking of going to Australia to visit the family or?
C	we have to decide fairly soon what we're going to do
B	oh yeah
C	um
B	I wouldn't mind I just don't know where I'm gonna be so
C	no that's ok
B	that's the problem
C	and it's impossible to travel from
B	Don't know
C	you might
B	mm
C	yeah it's it's too much for my little brain
B	but when would you go if you went?
C	em probably March I think
B	isn't she having another baby?
C	mm hm
B	when's she?
C	like now
B	oh
C	yeah
B	I lose track
B	it?
C	she
B	oh
C	she is having another girl
B	and eh
C	nope
B	maybe they'll have a boy next time
C	mm who knows? And I can't remember what birthstone is for March
B	no amethyst is May
C	no emerald is May
B	oh really? I thought May was amethyst
C	nope
B	oh
C	because
B	did you get a thank you letter in the end?
C	in the end
C	well I
B	is
C	yes eh part time I think
B	what does she do?
C	um she works for some fundraising organisation
B	how old are they now?
C	eh
B	maybe she will start leaving them in the sandpit on their own
C	well they ought to be able to by now
B	distract them
C	yeah
B	that's the thing
C	but that's what I used to do with you two
B	I do remember I have a memory of the sand pit we used to have out back here
C	mm hm
B	but for some reason the only memory I have of it is what it tasted like
C	that wasn't the object of the exercise but if that is the case then you and your brother are very similar
B	urgh
C	no
B	urgh
C	it's all extra protein
B	urgh
C	Strange boy
B	didn't he eat a a bulb off a lamp or something?
C	oh yes
B	and there was that night where he had to be taken to hospital
C	oh yes
B	for the
C	drinking the Calpol yes
B	cats are a lot easier than children are they?
C	you're not kidding You're not kidding  Then there was the time he painted
B	ow
C	yep
B	Don't scratch the carpet
C	cheeky
B	how old was he when he did that?
C	what? Shaved himself? mm
B	oh
C	possibly
B	was
C	I've no idea
C	yes well
B	it was all a ritual in the morning of he put his eye in he put his teeth in
C	mm hm
B	and then he's start shaving
C	uh-huh
B	but he'd get brush and the foam and put that all on his face first then take the the blade
C	yes
B	where did he go?
C	eh I don't know whether you remember
B	yeah
C	no
B	yes
C	yes of course cos you were there when you were older
B	aw
C	and when I got him home I said well weren't you worried that you were lost? And he said no
B	he was lucky that it was the only house on the road that had a blue door
C	oh no
B	and did you get the dog back?
C	yes
B	where was the dog?
C	the dog came back
B	the dog  The dog  knew where he lived anyway
C	yeah
B	was he so
C	no no it's no a dog
B	oh right
C	um so there won't be any more dogs but he's having this kitten
B	aw
C	poor little thing
B	when is he getting it?
C	well certainly not for another week
B	yes but they were super
C	yeah
B	anal about things weren't they?
C	yes if you get it from some private individual they'll usually let them go until after eight weeks seven or eight weeks
B	oh of course
C	Cos it's too little to be left all day um
B	can't he take it to work in his pocket?
B	it'll be tiny
C	so until he gets all that sorted eh he can't make any arrangements as to when he can have the kitten
B	oh
C	but I'm not absolutely sure
B	but was it the woman who phoned the rescue centre to get them to come and pick them up or is it
C	I don't know whether it was a concerned family member or neighbour or what I have no idea
B	little black cat
C	yeah
B	is it female or male?
C	male
B	yeah alright but
C	yes but her name is
B	when it was a female goldfish?
C	yeah
B	it is
C	oh yeah
B	it wasn't too cold?
C	no
B	and didn't it
C	I don't know what he did initially when he to but it it survived remarkably well
B	where did he live?
B	oh
C	I can't remember whether you ever went there
B	oh is he
C	nope
B	oh
C	this was nanny's side
B	she had six?
C	she had five brothers and one sister
B	and she's the only one left?
C	yep
B	aw
C	yep
B	and what about granddad's brothers and sisters?
C	no
B	really?
C	nope
B	mm
C	yes it's unfortunate there are no
B	oh that's the end of a line as well
C	mm
B	yup
C	there's no one with the surname
B	I think you should change your name back in a
C	no I don't think dear
B	A bid to continue the
C	I don't think so
B	well let's face it there's enough
C	yes
B	why is that?
C	my uncle
B	was he in the army?
C	navy
B	ah
C	and you know the old story about what a girl in every port
C	so I know not
B	when when was he there?
C	um the fifties
B	mm
C	um and I would be about oh gosh twelve? Thirteen?
B	was he involved in combat?
C	yeah
B	all the time?
C	not
B	oh
C	and that happened twice
B	lucky
C	the second time
B	naughty boy
C	yes he was a naughty boy
B	he obviously passed his genes onto my brother then did he?
