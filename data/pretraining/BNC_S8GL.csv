A	yes in some ways
B	yeah
A	and it is rubbish
B	yeah
B	I like sweets

A	see I go starter main
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	but when we did this meal last week for
A	dessert yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	while if I eat it I'll actually probably be physically sick cos I can't eat that much
A	yeah
B	mm
A	starter's not always big and heavy is it and then
B	no
A	you can eat all your main and then think
B	no
A	oh that's it I don't like pudding anyway
B	mm
A	nice cup of coffee
A	I'd do a cheeseboard
B	yeah oh yeah
A	oh I love a cheeseboard
B	yeah

A	but it's it's it's out of fashion yeah
B	we
A	have em at Christmas don't they?
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	but yes we do like cheese we are an all-cheese family
A	oh I do cheese terrible
A	terrible cheese
B	yes
A	say right
B	mm
B	no
A	they just think
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	from being a kid even as a kid as like five-
A	mm
B	and he was like that and just used to love it
A	I love Stilton
B	yeah
A	Danish blue
B	yeah he loves all that
A	yes
B	and he loves Camembert that's one of his favourites
B	yeah
A	cheese slices which are
B	yeah
A	cheese slices like there's nothing in them
B	no it's it's a really distinctive taste isn't it?
A	mm
B	my nephew he really likes all the different cheeses
A	mm
B	he'll he'll oh like yes I'll have some of that some of that
A	mm
B	me sister she eats lots of raw peppers but she only likes double Gloucester
A	yeah that's like my boys are like that
B	she's the same
A	they'll eat Gloucester and that
B	yeah
A	they'll eat it but if it's got white and fruit and it
B	do they like try new stuff? or
A	yeah
B	they know what they like and they like to eat that
A	they know what they like yeah
B	you know?
A	see
B	yeah
A	like a sausage casserole
B	mm
A	mushrooms
B	yeah
A	when I do one I have to sort of do a different pot for him then get the hot pot out for me and
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but
A	and then it I'll do a couple of Yorkshires with it for
B	yeah
A	with it
B	that's like
A	do you know what I mean?
B	deconstructed?
B	so it's the heart of fashion isn't it you've had a cuisine
A	so yeah so I'll say oh I'll do a sausage casserole for tea and then
B	mm
A	I always have to do
B	yeah
A	cos he don't like all the onion the gravy and
B	yeah
A	but he loves gravy
B	yeah
A	you see he can
B	mm
A	pour the gravy onto the Yorkshire
B	I've got a friend that doesn't like onion
A	if it's not like
B	and she and she says the onion
A	yeah that's it's that's what he says and he always says it makes the gravy taste weird
B	mm
A	but
B	no
A	cos he won't eat sprint onion or anything like that
B	no
A	if we go to a takeaway
B	mm
A	but no onion
B	yeah
A	cos it comes and one bit sliced he won't touch it
B	yeah
A	the whole thing's
B	well it's
A	yeah it's strong especially when it's raw isn't it?
B	mm
A	it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I I
A	yeah
B	but I don't like too much of it
A	mm
B	whereas
A	yeah I'm a bit like that
B	yeah
A	raw onion is er
B	it's funny isn't it taste things? and they reckon taste changes
A	oh wow
B	over your whole body
A	yeah
B	the smell and
A	they do I know I know about
B	mm
A	my brother's just suddenly been diagnosed with peanut allergy
B	yeah
A	but he's forty
B	mm
A	forty-three
B	yeah
A	cos he's never had
B	no
A	that's
B	mm
A	type two so he just takes the tablet
B	yeah
A	and then suddenly he's got this allergy I'm like
B	how did that come out? what? how did he find out?
A	well just tests and that yeah
B	oh right
A	dunno he had something wrong with his eyes
B	so has he has he had anaphylactic shock or swelling or anything?
A	mm
B	he's had that with eating them has he?
A	yeah he has got he has a pen
B	Epipen?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but that didn't come out until
B	no
A	you know a few years back
B	yeah
A	and you think well
B	yeah
A	and then suddenly
B	yeah
A	at his age like where's that come from? yeah
B	yeah they do
A	strange innit?
B	it's it is strange and peanut's quite a serious one
A	yeah
B	cos it
A	yeah
B	it mind you mind you if you're allergic to peanuts it doesn't mean you're allergic to other nuts
A	that's right yeah
B	if you're allergic to other nuts it doesn't mean you're allergic to
A	yeah
B	peanuts cos they're different
A	mm
B	or the
A	it's terrible for him cos now being
B	all the diagnoses as well yeah
B	no
A	do you know what I mean he's
B	yeah
A	terrible to go shopping with cos he's
B	and the
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos he
B	with not having sugar in?
A	yeah cos he had his heart attack as well
B	yeah
A	he just he's completely
B	yeah
A	all over the place
B	yeah
A	and I said to him like
B	that's a shame
A	cos my mum went and got him
B	mm
B	yeah
A	and I said to him remember he's type two
B	yeah can't have anything
A	take the injection that's what he's thinking
B	yeah so
A	I said
B	yeah
A	so
B	it's really just researching it and guessing and really going through it with him isn't it?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I said to him oh we need need something
B	mm
A	sit and read and
B	yeah that's it
A	so that's what she did she went and got him one so
B	yeah
A	yeah not really but
B	does he? no because it it's it's a necessity?
B	mm
A	because he knows it's a necessity
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos he's not a big eater
B	yeah
A	cheese and I said
B	yeah
A	me
B	yeah
A	and I'm like what's he doing?
B	yeah
A	I can't you know?
B	is he is he testing? has he
A	er
B	or not?
A	oh I don't think so no
B	no
A	I just
B	mm
A	blood tests and that
B	mm
A	I know his feet
B	he ought to ask just
A	and have
B	if he can see a dietician
A	drops put in his mouth
B	he ought to go to his doctor's and just say
A	mm
B	can I see a dietician? and
A	mm
B	who could go and
A	yeah cos he's getting a bit confused with
B	mm
A	type one I think
B	yeah
A	which
B	yeah
A	you know they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but naturally
A	I think it's
B	it's it's worried him made him realise
A	mm yeah
B	yeah
A	cos when he went back to work
B	mm
A	an outside job a lady wanted her fascias doing
B	mm
A	cos when he had his heart attack he was up a ladder
B	oh right
A	painting
B	goodness
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and just asked my dad if he could
B	yeah
A	got there
B	yeah
A	and just froze
B	yeah
A	couldn't do it
A	so me dad
B	mm
A	he got round he done it
B	yeah
A	he's alright now
B	yeah
A	but it just shows you when he got there he was like
B	mm
A	lady was out
B	yeah
A	he was looking at
B	oh yeah
A	he got erm
B	okay
A	they put a
B	a stent in?
A	a stent in yeah
B	yeah
A	and then they found out he was
B	mm
A	a little bit overweight but
B	yeah
A	then they found out he was diabetic and all that so they sorta triggered it all together
B	mm
A	and that's
B	so he's had a a scare really
A	yeah
B	an almighty scare and just
A	yeah gonna say he's only he's only eighteen months older than me forty-three forty-four in February he'll be
B	yeah
A	so he's still young ain't he?
B	yeah
A	so he's got a little boy
B	mm
A	so you know? but yeah it scared him
B	and when did he have it how long ago?
A	er it was only
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh so it's all still quite new then? it's
A	yeah
B	mm
A	to do the outside jobs and that that he gets so it was probably April May
B	mm
A	so it's not been that long
B	mm
A	but er
B	oh so it's it's quite new like I say so really
A	yeah
B	see just go and see people that he needs to see
A	cos I said to him
B	mm
B	but if he's if he's
A	well he's got a thing
B	well
A	saturated fats
B	yeah
A	he's
B	yeah
A	I said
B	mm
A	he's just completely
B	so is he is on his own?
A	yeah he is
B	yeah
A	yeah he is
B	and
A	he does yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and that's the
A	mm
B	and yeah
A	erm and he cos
B	mm
A	I
B	yeah
A	I could never see him eating something like that before but
B	yeah
A	he done he he had peppers and everything in it and the chicken and
B	yeah
A	and I sorta thought
B	so he's eating right it's not as if he's not eating
A	yeah
B	to
B	think of it as him being healthy rather than him being paranoid about the diabetes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	he'll go to me mum's and mum'll say oh do you like a sandwich and that
B	mm
A	and all this I've got eggs and now you don't have to have bacon or cheese
B	no
A	you can have an egg
B	scrambled egg or something yeah
A	scrambled egg on toast or he'll
B	oh he's gonna be
A	mm mm
A	you know but?
B	yeah
A	he's sorta still a little bit
B	you might find in six months to a year he'll relax a bit and
A	mm
B	and actually then start to allow some things in
A	yeah
B	but it
unknown_female	it stops
B	he's looked at his own mortality hasn't he?
A	he did yeah cos he used to smoke as well and he's packed that up
B	yeah
B	that's
B	cos he wanted to talk to you about that didn't he?
A	well he does
B	mm
A	he goes you ain't smoking in my house nor my garden he goes
B	no
B	so what is it with the smoking with you is it do you want to give up or do you not do you enjoy it and you just?
A	I I enjoy it really
B	yeah?
A	yeah it's just a bad habit innit?
B	yeah
A	smoking since I was what fifteen?
B	yeah
A	see my mum and dad used to smoke they packed up when I was what?
B	yeah
A	they stopped so
B	mm
A	they've been stopped a good few years yeah
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	now he can't stand it
B	no
A	he started off having one of them fake
B	electric
A	ones
B	ones
A	yeah and then
B	yeah nicotine
A	the normal ones
B	yeah
A	and he
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	his dues he's done it
B	that's it
B	but you've gotta want to do it haven't you that's the thing it's
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm not ready
B	no
A	but if he never had a scare I don't think he would've stopped
B	no
A	cos he always enjoyed it
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean I think the heart attack and that's
B	mm
A	that's what made him stop the scare so
B	yeah
A	if that didn't happen
B	you don't wanna wait till you have a heart attack or something you'll
A	no
B	oh I might stop now then
A	yeah that's funny innit?
B	well you might find with this
A	mm
B	you've got your own business get yourself going with that and say
A	mm
B	do you wanna have all the stress and hassle that you had working for the company
A	that's right yeah
B	and you might find that actually that would settle
A	during the days like when I'm
B	no
A	it's when I get in the car have a quick fag on the way to the next house
B	yeah
A	so I end up I mean I'll have
B	no that isn't too bad actually
A	it's when we get home on the evening or teatime
B	do you smoke in the house?
B	right you ought to start saying now you're gonna smoke outside not in the conservatory
A	mm
B	and be really strict with that
A	mm
B	do you think yeah
A	in your local pub innit gotta go outside?
A	so yeah no I sit in the conservatory
B	yeah
A	that
B	it's
B	but
A	mm
B	but you might find it'll
A	mm
B	no
A	you know what I mean?
B	that's fair enough
A	get
B	yeah
A	little
B	is he still? having problems at school?
A	he
B	yeah
A	good days and then he just goes silly again
B	mm
A	our English teacher rang me last week
B	mm
A	cos he weren't doing like she asked in his lesson and he's like well I don't really care and
B	yeah
A	and I said to him well you do care
B	you need to get your English
A	and the teacher said well he can do it she said it's just stupid it's like took him ten minutes to get a book out
B	that's probably more frustrating
A	cos he's doing
B	yeah
A	that's more controlling the classroom
B	yeah
A	or the bunch of kids
B	yeah
A	than
B	yeah
A	no and I thought
B	so she needs to just work a way of saying
A	mm
B	get your thing out do this do this
A	now
B	yeah
A	or leave the room
B	yeah
A	cos
B	yeah
A	I don't think she's got her own bloody child if you ask me
A	cos a lot of em up there are in only in their early twenties
B	yeah
A	just qualified and straight in
B	yeah straight in and actually
A	they sorta look like they'd be better off with
B	yeah
A	where they know they're gonna be naughty
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	instead of like
B	yeah
A	yap yap yap yap
B	yeah cos it
A	mm
B	when actually you've gotta have some life experience to actually be able to manage the teenagers haven't you?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	can you work with kids though?
B	yeah that's the thing that's it
A	cos they don't actually do that in their training do they?
B	no
A	go to school they're just chucked in
B	yeah
A	off you go
B	yeah
A	and they're like woah

B	and I only saw a couple cos it
A	yeah
B	and one of the other ones found it really hard and he was up at sort of going midnight every night just marking and doing a planning
A	oh
B	and doing it and
A	mm
B	I
A	mm
B	some of them are quite intimidating aren't they?
B	mm
A	but my friend erm
B	yeah
A	I mean I can go round there sit talk to him play a game and he's absolutely find
B	yeah
A	she'd go he'll won't do that with me
B	yeah
