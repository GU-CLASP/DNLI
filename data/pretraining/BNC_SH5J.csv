A	suddenly
A	everybody's the the authorities have got scared
B	nothing
A	going mental over arresting everybody
C	but then why were these people like Jimmy Savile given so much power?
A	I don't know why he was yeah
C	to walk into a hospital and
A	well I
C	the nurses saying don't let him be anywhere near me
A	yeah
C	and make sure you don't leave him in the room at the same time
A	because the the the if if the individual nurses made any er they were sacked weren't they? cos the
C	oh yeah I'm sure he did I know he done
A	yeah
C	a lot for Stoke Mandeville
A	but that's why they let him get away with it because it without him they didn't you know Stoke Mandeville was a charity hospital wasn't it? without him they lost a massive massive amount of revenue income
C	so they're putting all their patients
A	yeah
C	at risk
A	it would seem so you know the odd
C	for money?
A	the odd patient getting groped
B	it was nineteen seventy
A	yeah it was a very different age with different attitudes wasn't it? we've got to remember that
D	that's
C	well you say about
B	mm?
C	Stuart Hall and
A	yeah
C	all them
A	yeah
C	Kid Jenson will they investigate all of them now then?
A	well I think if there's allegations made against them they'll investigate everybody
C	and what happened about Dave Lee Travis then?
A	well he was acquitted I mean he's just been destroyed hasn't he?
C	mm
A	but I do believe there's another case coming up against him at some point
C	because when you looked on the telly when they arrested that
A	yeah
C	wife was
A	oh my god she's
C	she
A	like an old she looked like his mother
C	yeah and she looked absolutely horrified
A	I don't know but his daughter stood by him all the way through
C	mm
A	but even though it was her best you know
C	mm
B	I mean that's
A	but
C	yeah it's like they're looking who can we have that
A	yeah
C	shock factor on now because like
B	all these people there's somebody oh oh actually I remember when somebody touched me
A	yeah
B	you know somebody felt my arse when I was you know
A	mm
B	so it happens get over it
A	yeah
C	but then to go
B	cos my
C	but then to go
B	otherwise everyone would be in jail
A	you know
B	wouldn't they? you know?
C	to go to Portugal and
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and question Cliff Richard
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I can't believe it of him but like the the Dave Lee Travis thing for instance now I'm not talking about the full paedophilia here the Jimmy Saviles I think Stuart Hall
B	yeah
A	probably all that those who really seriously abuse children
B	mm yes it's different
A	that's a different thing but the Dave Lee Travis you know you've got to remember we're back in the seventies here he was a good looking young DJ with a lot of
C	yeah
A	young girls chasing after him round corners and I'm not saying it was right but it was kind of socially
C	acceptable
A	then for them to for fifteen year olds who probably looked about nineteen you know quick quick grope in the corridor or a quick hand up the skirt and it's wrong and I know
C	but it happened
A	it happened then
B	it happened yeah that's what I'm saying it's
A	and I'm not saying that it's not good but er that's
B	yeah
A	you know it's good that that has changed and
B	yeah
A	men can't
B	yeah
A	go round
B	yeah
A	putting
B	yeah
A	their hand up girls' skirts
B	no
A	and everyone giggling and thinking
B	yeah
A	it's a bit of a laugh but that's a it was a and you can't judge past things on today's standards
C	no
A	and I don't think he did anything wrong by the standards of his day
B	no
A	I don't think he was a paedophile I think he was a young man
B	mm
A	with a lot of
B	yeah
A	silly young girls chasing after
C	yeah
A	him
A	I mean when you look at these pop concerts of the Bay City Rollers
A	yeah
C	and girls fainting
A	yeah
C	and the Beatlemania
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and I'm sure
A	I know
B	oh do you?
A	don't you?
B	do you?
D	oh I don't wanna talk about it again
A	oh no go on because it
D	I just can't be bothered to
A	it's quite
D	this morning I just can't be bothered
B	yeah
A	oh
D	we've talked about it before
A	I know but I can't remember what your argument was and it was it was a valid argument it makes sense but I just I just still
D	I just don't wanna get can I just say it and then
A	yeah
D	I just
B	yeah right
D	can't be bothered to get into a big debate
A	we won't we won't debate it
B	no we won't comment no
A	you just say
D	I can't be bothered to get into a debate
B	right
D	this morning
B	right
D	but I just said that
A	yeah
D	an allegation
A	yeah fair enough
D	and the other thing is
A	but I don't think they're looking into the
B	but but
A	investigations far enough before they
D	okay well that's a different issue
A	before they're make the arrests
D	they have to make the arrests
A	yeah
D	or whatever
A	mm
D	what they always do with any historical allegations anyway
A	mm
D	and if something was done illegally and someone complains what else can the police do other than
A	mm
D	someone's burgled my house oh well
B	what am I doing with this?
A	that one
D	that's bad
A	yeah no I yeah I see your point
D	if someone's made the allegations what can they do? they have to
A	mm I can see your point but I
D	I just don't see another way around it
A	don't think these allegations against
D	yeah I'm sure there's a lot of fake ones
A	I'm not talking about children I'm talking about late mid to late teens
D	no no I agree but
A	kind of the mm
D	if it's illegal and he did it and then that
A	yeah
D	person's complained whether how rightly or wrongly that is something
B	yeah mum's saying they shouldn't complain and they should
A	yeah
B	have moved on by now
D	but that's a different
A	move on with your life
D	that's a different issue though isn't it?
B	get on with it you know? yeah
D	the fact is they have complained
A	because er maybe at the time
D	and there's no other way around it
A	it was not it they they weren't being assaulted by I'm not talking about you know I'm talking about the sort of
B	mm
A	I don't think they were being assaulted they were just
B	mm
A	getting a little bit of fun
B	well
A	at the time and now
C	yeah
A	they hear all this
B	and say oh I think oh I remember him oh I think I tell you what
A	oh he put his hand up my skirt once
B	yeah I'm gonna report him
A	in the corridor
C	yeah
B	and then that's suddenly
A	when I was chasing him
B	you know
A	and leading against the wall
B	exactly go and get a life you know?
A	mm
B	go and have a
C	Michael Barrymore's kissed me on the cheek
