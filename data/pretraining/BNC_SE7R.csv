B	yeah yeah
A	they are really
C	good invention that
B	yeah
A	that's good
C	mm
A	I always do
B	yeah
A	cut his hair
C	do you?
A	yeah cut his hair
C	cut his hair
A	saves him money
C	he ain't got a lot
A	no but all around here
A	if he didn't have it cut you look now he'd be like Norris on Coronation Street
C	oh er
A	yeah round there
B	and just round the side was it?
A	yeah yeah
C	no I don't like that
A	no I don't like that
B	no no
A	yeah
C	do you do his eyebrows? cotton thread
A	yeah I put my
C	that's how I have mine done I
B	what er?
A	do you do yours?
C	do you do cotton?
B	the threading? no
C	yeah
B	do you do it yourself?
A	the threading?
C	no I go to the lady at
A	what do you do then with that?
C	well you just sit in a chair put your head back and they've got er they have a piece of cotton bit in the mouth
C	don't know why they just hold
B	mm
C	cos it's gotta be pulled tight they wrap it round the finger and then they put the cotton round the hairs
C	and plucks em like that
B	mm
C	and it's it lasts up to about eight weeks
B	yeah?
C	so I have mine done about every eight weeks
A	see I when they've been
C	it is a little bit sore cos she'll do your face
B	mm
A	yeah
C	eyebrows are not too bad er she'll do your lip
A	oh I know
B	yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
A	I shave mine myself
C	and erm well they say you shouldn't do that cos that's what causes blemishes and it grows back quicker
A	yeah mm
C	I can imagine you with a razor
A	I do I always shave mine
C	but yeah and they just
A	yeah
C	twist it they're ever so quick but yeah you get
B	yeah
C	a little red line but it goes down again
B	mm
A	as you get older your eyebrows don't grow so much
C	no no
A	I always used to pluck mine myself
C	cos years ago they removed em didn't they? and
B	yeah and used to
B	yeah yeah yeah no I do
C	it looks awful
B	cos er when they've been plucked and plucked so much they don't grow back do they?
C	no
B	so they end up people then now having to draw their eyebrows in even though they don't want to cos they've got nothing there
C	that's right
A	yeah
C	and you can see it
B	and you can get they get tattoo things don't they?
C	yeah I know horrible ain't it?
B	tattooed eyebrows on and that just looks so false it just looks horrible
A	yeah I don't like the look of that
B	no
C	yeah they just er sort of tidy em up round the outside and thin em out
B	mm
C	but I only have it done every couple of months cos I
A	I've never heard of that
C	they're due to be
B	yeah
C	done again actually so
A	well they don't look bad
A	I've never heard of that
B	it's quite a new thing I've seen em in
C	yeah that's where I go
B	yeah
C	the lady there she's
B	cos it it's like plucking with tweezers
C	she's ever so ever so nice
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	and she'll tint your eyebrows as well
B	yeah
C	if you want a bit of colour putting in em or anything yeah
B	I think a couple of times I've had someone do my eyebrows when I've gone places where I've had facials and that and I've said oh yeah do my eyebrows and they always do them like quite severe and I don't like mine are a fairly good shape anyway
C	what? pluck? or with the threading?
B	yeah plucking them
C	oh right
B	or waxing them
A	do you pluck em yourself?
B	I do myself but I only take a few out here cos that's pretty much my shape
C	that's
B	so I just take a few out here
C	mm
B	every now and then every few months I look and think oh I've got a couple growing there
C	yeah I do I've got
B	but now I've got odd grey ones coming and I go like this and pulling the grey ones out
A	no not grey sometimes I have that's the only thing I have
B	yeah
A	and I always know because if I go like that they're long grey ones
C	mm
B	they are they're longer and they're they're thicker aren't they?
C	they're the ones I get I sort of look and think oh there's one there and I'm like
B	erm I keep plucking them out
C	and when I get that's when I think right I need to go to see the lady
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't see mine very well now
B	no but you haven't got a lot as you say you they're quite
C	you haven't got a lot no
A	no probably because I've always plucked em you see
B	yeah I think eventually they're
C	but they're very fair aren't they?
A	mm
B	yeah
C	so you can't really see them
A	grey
B	mm
C	my grey's it's come through since I've had it cut ain't it?
B	yeah
C	it's terrible ain't it?
A	not bad though that's good your hair always looks tidy
B	yeah yeah it does
C	I missed an appointment I had an appointment last Tuesday think it was last
B	yeah
C	I said to you I'm going for a haircut
B	yeah
C	when I got up there my lady
B	oh right
C	and she weren't very well and had to go home cos she's diabetic so
B	right
A	oh that's awful
C	she's had
B	mm
C	you know not the best of and it's IVF
B	oh wow
C	yeah she's been trying about three and a half years
A	oh ain't that awful?
C	so she's not had the best of pregnancies so she had to go home cos she weren't
C	at short notice so I said don't worry about it they she said I could come back teatime
B	yeah
C	but I couldn't do teatime so
B	no
C	so I made it for the following week
B	mm
B	yeah
A	er was that at
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah

B	mm
C	so and they got a new she's gone on to maternity leave now full time so
C	so she won't be back until so they've got another lady in now
B	yeah
C	so she cut it but
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	same
B	yeah they just do it don't they? yeah
A	yeah it's quite
C	and my hair's really thick and
B	yeah
C	when she cut it she's like oh do you want me to thin that out? I said cut it first cos it's so deceiving
B	yeah mm
C	once it's been cut you don't always need thinning out
B	no no
A	yeah
C	she did a bit she did a bit of both
B	yeah so is she gonna do yours when your lady's off on maternity?
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	she'll stay there now she said she's got a permanent position there
B	mm oh that's alright then
C	so that's alright yeah
A	mm

A	yeah for the colour
C	mine's something like that
B	but they say
C	yeah
B	and they do it and er every sort of I think it's four or five goes you get a free cut with the colour
C	oh right

C	nice
B	mm
A	them and
C	where are you going?
C	oh at?
B	yeah yeah we're going there
C	mm
B	yeah
B	yeah I've just looked at
B	got the new menu's they've just come out and I've looked and there's
A	cos they change every now and then don't they?
B	yeah and there's quite a lot of difference so you can still have your
A	yeah
B	your vintage hunter's chicken that's still there but a lot of other stuff's different so what I'm doing I was just doing it now I'm printing off the new menus and I'm gonna send go and see everybody and say this is what you'd ordered this is the new menu and get everyone just to look and see er
A	yeah
B	er so if they wanna change anything cos er the er like the the Pimm's Eton mess that's not there any more so you'll have to choose a different pudding and loads of people had
A	yeah
B	chosen that so I was just doing that at the minute
C	yeah
A	yeah cos they change
B	printing them off
C	this is a different season we're getting into autumn now so it's different seasonal vegetables
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah they changed
C	ain't it? so they change their menus
B	mm
C	a lot don't they?
B	well he said sometimes they change a little bit and other times they change quite a lot but
C	mm
B	so I thought oh I'm just printing them off now and I'm gonna let everybody have the stuff back and if they can pretty much get it back to me the next day
C	yeah mm
B	and then I'll send it all through but it'll be fine
C	mm
A	yeah
B	so
C	you're you're pre-ordering before you get there?
B	yeah we're gonna pre-order yeah
B	because er with cos there's fifteen of us going aren't there?
A	yeah
B	isn't there? so
C	oh yeah know know what you want then don't you?
B	yeah
C	that's a good idea
B	yeah that's it except
A	yeah she don't eat
C	oh bless
