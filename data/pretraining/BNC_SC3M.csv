A	yeah
B	we are we're we're gonna be in a bit of
A	is Mr

A	why is that what is wrong with
B	well we've never had the class of teachers
A	no
B	and we've always we've always managed to fudge our way through we've never been really good but the kids are all so we haven't got the class of I'm not being funny we haven't got the class of kids either
A	yeah it is
B	really
A	I think it is with like you
B	the kids are so disrespectful
A	yeah
B	they're just so disobedient at the moment and we've got so many kids who have got the mental problems and I'm I'm not talking I'm not being funny I'm talking mental problems
A	really?
B	as in yeah I can't remember how many what percentage did
A	really?
B	absolutely masses of them
A	how can children be on antidepressants?
B	oh they are it's unbelievable
A	but to fair I don't think
B	I know they shouldn't
A	like when they when I was like
B	I yeah
A	like sad last year
B	I I was
A	and she gave me the option of going on antidepressants
B	mm
A	so I said no
B	I needed them I had to have them
A	yeah you did you were like really bad and I was really bad but I knew
B	right
A	that it would change so I didn't need them
B	no
A	I didn't want them
B	no you should look I mean I went to see this absolutely phenomenal and she really was a phenomenal counsellor big black girl called erm
A	yeah
B	she said it was it was no she didn't she didn't bunny hug and the first thing I said to her she said after the first meeting I should have had a erm a no the first meeting was an hour the second meeting should have been half an hour but she kept me going for nearly forty-seven minutes
A	yeah
B	and she said to me she said to me afterwards she says have you felt benefitted? I said yeah I said had you been a bunny hugger you wouldn't have seen me again she said the last thing I ever do is bunny hug she says because that's not gonna help you at all
A	no
B	she says all that's gonna do is you know won't do any good
A	well it's like with
B	yeah
A	like she's sad and stuff and like I can't I'm not gonna turn around and tell you like I'm gonna give you the truth like
B	mm
A	I want to be blunt with you you know like?
B	mm
A	you've got to make changes you've got to change your job you've got to change what you're doing
B	mm
A	because you're not helping yourself you're just making it worse
B	mm
A	and I think like people do people respond better to that kind of help than just
B	yeah
A	you being like oh there there
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but when I spoke to the woman she said right she said put a note on your personnel file er this has been outstanding and has still not been erm sorted and then she said we can you know we'll look at it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and we were told when we were merging that our team was erm
B	yeah
A	and I bet she got a salary increase
B	yeah
A	and it's just a bit like we are the ones who have suddenly taken on this massive extra work
B	oh we're the same we're the same
A	and you're not giving us the credit
B	we're the same I have been given a complete job which if I was doing this job as a standalone job
A	yeah
B	as data management a standalone job I would be earning thirty-five thousand pounds a year
A	yeah
B	I'm doing exams and data management
A	and you're on
B	and I'm twenty
A	twenty twenty twenty-eight
B	twenty-eight and that is what's really upset me and it because I can't get it sorted out before I can't do it on the pay and benefits
A	yeah
B	thing from the council so I then have to go in back into the I now go into the public sector er the private sector
A	would you want to go into would you want to change your job and go into the private sector?
B	that's well I am we're moving into the private sector
A	oh I see when are they gonna be able to pay you more?
B	no no because the private sector will not pay erm those levels
A	yeah wish I was on thirty-five grand
B	you will be I was on
A	yeah
B	at your age I was on four thousand eight hundred
B	so her
A	sponsorship yeah so and her company it costs a lot to sponsor somebody to stay in the country so
B	what company is she with?
A	she's like erm I
B	no
A	somebody like you know manages like don't really know just looks after families who need extra support
B	uhu
A	he turned round and his email was really cryptic it was like erm this is really sad and we're gonna get together over the next few days and decide what the next move is for us and we haven't got any replacement and stuff so we don't know whether there's gonna be a bit of a restructure like whether someone
B	well if there's a restructure
A	yeah
B	what they might do is move you up because they've recognised that you're good haven't they?
A	yeah but
B	they might move you move you up
A	I don't think they will we're
B	well you don't know
A	no because we've you we've just restructured like we merged production and project coordination
B	doesn't matter
A	they're not gonna do it but erm
B	they might do you don't know
A	but erm yeah but everybody was a bit like why is
B	and you don't know where she's gone or anything?
A	yeah she's going to
B	so she was obviously headhunted by
A	well yeah we work really closely with them they well they work just down the road from us so erm people it just er seems a bit weird like people weren't sure whether they whether she might have been like forced out by
B	no I would suspect that she erm that working closely with
A	yeah
B	that's probably what happened
A	I doubt it but a lot well a lot of people from
B	mm
A	no
A	yeah that is that is
B	yeah
A	the same with
B	the same
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah
A	well that's normally why they have variants
B	mm
A	so they have paper variants that you could do paper variants who like two one and they could like people abroad could do

A	paper variants
B	we got
A	two two

A	at least they had replacement papers
B	well they always do
A	oh do they?
B	they always make up they always do replacement papers using
A	yeah
B	I don't know why they don't make the replacement papers up very quickly they have obviously made up their a second paper just in case there's one
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	cos it was so topical
A	oh examinations

B	mm
A	intervened I've I genuinely felt like if I tried to help her
B	yeah
A	he would start on me
B	yeah
A	and I was like that's really bad a society where we can't help people
B	mm
A	because we're afraid we're gonna get attacked
B	mm
A	did he?
B	mm
A	who?
B	erm
A	oh
B	and erm he was in a Kentucky Fried Chicken and they they had a a you know they they sort of either jumped ahead or something like this in the queue and he sort of stood up for his party and said don't do that you know anyway the people in Kentucky Fried Chicken threw him out into the street cos they didn't want any problems in the thing so when he got kicked in the street he then walked into another restaurant and said look can someone help me please I'm being beaten up here and they turned round and said no out you go cos we we don't want any trouble
A	oh my god

A	but to be fair if dad died would we still speak to
B	no
A	exactly
B	but I wouldn't
A	no you just wouldn't have anything to talk to them about
B	but this is because
A	mm

A	mm
B	where he wouldn't have had to if
A	I see
B	uhu
A	at least I still have my dad
