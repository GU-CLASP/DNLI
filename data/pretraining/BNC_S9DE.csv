A	yeah
B	should we go ahead and do that?
A	yeah with all the rabbits underneath that got underneath and the dog so much that pushed all the soil up and I think it's rubbing one of the floorboards
B	but we can easily put

B	floor on top can't we?
A	yeah yeah
B	right but we need to get the
A	I'm expecting to fall through it one day as we walk through there because that will

A	yeah we gotta have it because it's got all the spare tiles in it's got the ladders in
B	definite we do need it
A	we do need it yeah but what I'll do as well is dig around the edges and put a net in the and do it so they can't dig underneath

B	that's tiny
A	that is in nineteen thirty-nine
B	mm
A	when he was born
B	mm he's doing so much better now isn't he
A	he's named after the doctor that saved his life
B	mm
A	his name was
B	oh I thought it was
A	no no no that was our doctor our village doctor and his name was Dr
A	that's how we know him by great bloke he used to come and visit us when we were ill and all but then it was only a little village then wasn't it
B	yeah
A	now look at it it's a suburb of knowledge
B	mm no-one wants to live in
B	yes I know
A	well someone have got to live somewhere
B	but that's what everyone says don't they?
A	someone has got to live somewhere
B	of course they have it's the strangest little places don't you really?
A	yeah and it's only the people that make it what they are
B	yeah
A	and every single
B	they do real odd
A	well it is odd
B	it does happen
A	and you get a full year of really disruptive pupils
B	mm
B	and you only have like well two in the year who are very ambitious and
A	well you still get that even in a in a disruptive year
B	totally different
A	yeah you still get that disruptive now when when we were when I was at school which is very long time ago
B	yeah
A	and uh most of them were fantastic absolutely fantastic
B	oh
A	I mean and then got on well they seemed to get along in a higher grade than most of the local boys I mean we had grades and it was A B C and D
B	yeah
A	and the D fool seems like they could never read or write or anything
B	so you can't have had many cos you said it was a small school you can't have had many
A	not for senior school for senior school it was more
B	how many do you think were in a class
A	we had thirty in a class
B	oh
A	sometimes sometimes twenty-six but mostly thirty and when I was in my last year we had eight in my class
A	eight
B	eight?
A	mm
B	that's nice wasn't it?
A	it was great because uh what had happened they used to be able to leave in in uh September they didn't really
B	no
A	well they leave end of
B	end of the year July
A	end of the year but then they could leave also if they if they had a job at Christmas time
B	oh I see
A	and they only they could only leave if they got a job
B	mm
A	and we finished up with eight and then
B	big family isn't it?
A	yeah but then look this is how this is how I come to get a job in engineering because
B	mm
A	the the headmaster he said uh come with me
B	mm
A	and they give me a job
B	yeah
A	yeah and I left school at fifteen years old
B	mm
A	went in the apprenticeship and a an apprenticeship then was a six year apprenticeship well not it was a five year apprenticeship but you had to serve one year before they gave you an apprenticeship to see if you were good enough
B	yeah did you do six years apprenticeship?
A	yeah
B	six years
A	I left that that
B	oh a long time that
A	yeah that is when you're earning two pound three and a penny a week
B	oh
A	when you had to give your mum and dad a
B	all the money
A	quid and all of the money yes well two pound is still two pound
B	can't be anything else can it?
A	two pound is still two pound isn't it? but the three and a penny is what would that equate to? fifteen pence fifteen and a half pence
B	mm
A	so yeah but I thought well for my headmaster he was brilliant fantastic bloke I should have gone around and seen him before he died
B	yeah
A	cos he got me the
B	oh
A	yeah and he got uh
B	what the mental home?
A	no Plumstead engineering it was
A	Plumstead Plumstead is a village
B	okay
A	well I thought you knew
B	I was just guessing
A	but you don't know about engineering
B	no I wouldn't know about engineering
A	you haven't even had a
B	I will do
A	when you've got to set it up again
B	whereabouts are you gonna put that one?
A	I don't know it will have to go in that room in the chair
B	it will won't it?
A	yeah I'll have to move the chair
B	I don't think we can
A	mm yeah well I got next door
B	I know you did yeah but was it the lifting up or was it
A	you wouldn't be able to lift you wouldn't be able to no
B	but what about you?
B	but what about you?
A	get
B	that's not fair is it?
A	oh yes he does
A	yeah
B	oh
B	yeah
A	oh dear well I'm sure
A	mm
A	my brother
B	yeah I
A	oh well maybe we can have a lifting party
B	the four of us
A	well other people come we can fill them up with beer and make them uh do the lifting for us
B	I know I know uh is it
A	yeah
B	next door
A	yeah
B	he said he'd do it again didn't he?
A	yeah he did but he's hurt his back since then
B	oh yeah
B	knee operation oh dear
A	the only strong person I know really strong and healthy is
B	yeah
A	we'll have to get him
B	I don't know
A	and
B	yeah she can oh dear
A	well it's well I'll get someone to help me I can get lift one end and he can lift the other I mean that's the only way
B	oh what are they doing with it? just one person can
A	yeah he did it yeah
B	how silly
A	well they learned to haven't they? the most anyone is allowed to lift is twenty-eight pound that's why they put all potatoes in a bag of twenty-eight pound
B	mm
A	but when I used to work for
A	they were well over weight
B	worked in my dad's shop
A	yeah
B	I can't believe I did that really
A	no
B	I had to carry it like that
A	yeah
B	I couldn't do it any other way I had to hold it against my stomach
A	yeah
B	and carry it shouldn't shouldn't the people were letting you do that and taking it to the car were really weird isn't it?
A	yeah when you get grown men letting you take it
B	a thirteen year old girl
A	yeah but they were looking saying well look at her she can carry all that that's brilliant
B	yeah I suppose so
A	and they were admiring it they were admiring your strength you see
A	you know like men do
B	and then laughing really
A	I had a thirteen year old girl to do it
B	if you go up the um garden center
A	yeah
B	there's a girl takes all the compost out now
A	is it?
B	well she's done it twice for me and I've seen her unloading for other people
A	well how how much do they weigh? is that eighty litres?
B	they're quite heavy
A	what's a litre weigh?
B	they are heavy bags you know they are
A	a litre is
B	because we moved them together didn't we under the
A	but a litre is just bulk isn't it?
A	water it's supposed to be like kilogram
B	they're heavy aren't they?
A	yeah they are heavy yeah
B	that seems odd because there are plenty of men working there
A	well when I went to
B	oh yes she does she cleaned up for me as well
A	she came out for you did she?
B	uhu
A	I mean she's really young isn't she?
B	yeah
A	and she said she couldn't do it
B	yeah she said it's a place that only
A	alright
B	I don't know why it's that light the light is white the light that's out is right is right the way back under the bonnet
A	yeah
B	it's not where we were trying to
A	no
B	to find out it's really odd really isn't it that they I mean light bulbs go out all the time on cars don't they?
A	yeah
A	I mean I suppose if we take it up to the garage someone will look at it for me they'll charge an arm and a leg won't they
B	oh
A	about twenty quid I'll bet
B	yeah probably more than that
A	well it will be about three quid for the light bulb and he'll take fifteen minutes
B	mm
A	that's what he'll take
B	cos that's all they book down isn't it?
A	yeah
B	so they charge about
A	and if they charge fifty pound an hour
A	sure
B	an expensive job isn't it?
A	yeah oh yeah
B	oh yeah
A	oh I don't know how much they charge fifty pound an hour or what
B	who is he go have a look didn't she say she charged about ten pound to put that
A	yeah
B	headlamp in
A	yeah yeah it came up to that
B	although that is about the same money
A	yeah about a couple of ten quid
B	mm
A	there must be some instructions on how to do it in that book
B	well we couldn't find it could we
A	course it wouldn't cos it started up again
B	oh
B	I don't know
A	that's a waste of time we only had thirteen minutes only
A	I don't recall it though
A	no we only had thirteen minutes left
B	I said okay for some of the things no I think that's oh I didn't
A	it will stop I feel a little bit better now I've had a bath you know
B	what?
A	still exhausted I did get exhausted
B	oh
A	I mean exhausted where I just couldn't do much more
B	mm
A	it's all it's the weather
A	yeah
B	I know it's getting difficult but
A	what? chucking stuff away?
B	mm
A	well
B	well we haven't done many things before we do this and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I know I can't do anything else today
B	okay
A	because I'm nice and clean
B	oh yeah I won't be long there
A	well tomorrow I'll be nice and dirty again
B	oh
A	so what are we gonna do this weekend? huh huh huh
B	what apart from carrying on?
A	apart from looking after those idiots
B	do you want to do something else?
A	yeah

A	no
B	erm
A	where do you want to go?

B	that's what you did last week
A	can can we find one?
B	no
A	there must be some
B	I tried
A	somewhere about in Britain
B	I looked
A	huh
B	so we're not doing any work tomorrow then
A	yeah we've gotta do the barn the the shed
B	we are carrying on?
A	of course but when I get up like this I don't want to finish it I I can't handle this heat
B	so what's the next the next thing is to get that side pulled out
A	shelves to put up sideboards to pull pull to pieces there's loads of work to do
B	yeah
A	wood to cut
B	yeah it's getting kind of crunched up a bit at the moment
A	well you've stuck everything on top of the things
B	oh I didn't I've been labelling everything
A	you ain't got any labels left
B	I can find some more labels
A	oh that's okay then I can bring some more stuff in then
B	a lot of them like the saws and that you're gonna hang up aren't you?
A	saws'll be hanging up yes and they'll probably be hanging up on a nice little hook
B	proper rack yeah
A	a proper rack like so
B	yeah do a
A	on the wall
B	if you what are you thinking about doing a actual like like um a coat hook?
A	mm
B	effect
A	yeah
B	so you a strip of wood with all hooks on
A	yeah
B	and then then
A	yeah
B	yeah right
A	well they'll be screwed up to the wall before I put the hooks on cos some of the hooks I can put through like I've done those hooks in in the in the outhouse there where the kids have got their coat hooks
B	mm
A	you can't see any screws can you?
B	no
A	cos they're hidden underneath the hooks
B	well how did you get the hooks put on then?
A	because the hooks have got a hole there and a hole there or whatever or two holes there and in there I've got the a hook
B	mm
A	and a Rawlplug in the wall
B	mm okay
A	I'm not just a pretty face you know
B	I've got some nice metal metal ones that I got for for the garden shed if you want them
A	yeah I'll have every hook you've got otherwise I'll have to make them out of wire
B	er this is gonna be smart
A	yeah well I
B	mm okay
A	but I'm not going to cos you got them
A	good I ain't going to put theem up tonight though
B	no I know
A	oh
B	a what?
A	dragonfly
A	yeah you'll be chasing them with a camera now won't you?
B	I've got some good ideas for dragonflies now
A	oh don't forget we got to pick out our pictures
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	nice autumn pictures
A	yeah them that erm ones with er with with er
B	we don't want just trees though do we?
A	yeah but you got the trees with we got them ones with the er the lake and the er autumn trees in the lake
B	yeah
A	them ones
B	that's that's one I think he'll like
A	yeah
A	are they all autumn? or are there some?
B	I wanted something else like like the fungi you know?
A	yeah and then there's fungi
B	erm
A	loads of fungi I tell you what you
B	we haven't got that much rotten apple I've got a picture of
A	I'm going to pick up a puffball and chuck it and
B	yeah?
A	that won't make a real good picture but it will be really good
B	it would that would make an awful picture
A	it will yeah but that would be nice wouldn't it to be able to catch the puff bowl puffy
B	we got erm dandelion seed
A	mm did you did you see the dandelions this morning out there?
B	the dew on
A	with the dew on they looked as though they'd been wrapped in
B	mm
A	in in silk
B	mm
A	they looked
B	see we need something a bit different don't we?
A	yeah they looked lovely this morning
B	something different
A	yeah
B	that's why I think of something difficult and
A	I got a mouse picture
B	mm?
A	I got a mouse
B	yeah what a mouse eating an apple oh I picked up the um you know that plastic we stuffed in the in the cement mixer
A	yeah
B	plastic bag with napping and stuff
A	oh I bet there was a load of bug flies in there
B	no there was a mouse in there
A	oh was he?
B	yeah I pulled in out and it was fast running away
A	and he was in the cement mixer?
B	yeah in the plastic
A	better watch he don't get in the car
B	oh yeah he can't do that now can he?
A	they get they can climb up the wheels and they can get in through the engine compartment and chew chew chew chew through the electrics
B	I'll put one of those mouse things in the electric
A	oh that's a good idea
B	yes
A	and well
B	mm
B	what take some stuff on?
A	yes
B	mm we need some we need some on the um tool shed cos
A	yes
B	he's eaten quite a lot of stuff in there
A	he has hasn't he
B	it that smells like a mouse now
A	yeah well why don't you go and put some in?
B	okay I'll do that now then
A	yeah I shall finish my cup of tea and just sit here
B	okay
A	alright then don't work too hard will you?
B	no
