A	do you remember in wind band that time
A	and
B	yeah with the erm
A	and then
A	on the clarinet and er I thought she was gonna
A	be sick
B	and she cos she suddenly
A	was like
A	mm
A	and I was like
B	I just thought she started playing clarinet weirdly like
B	no one does
A	I thought she was gonna be
A	sick
B	when does wind band
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I don't really like the
B	so do I I like erm
B	yeah
A	yeah I like that one
B	yeah
A	because
B	oh yeah
A	party
B	because they will like it no matter if you're good or bad
A	mm
B	what to clarinet one?
A	mm
B	well you'll be fine and I'll just not play and pretend I am and then you can just play for both of us
B	mm
B	I feel kind of feel kind of awkward for
A	mm
B	even though she'll only play like one note in a bar
B	like I
A	mm
B	I play half of it she plays like a quarter of it
A	mm
B	and you play all of it
A	well not all of it
B	yeah you do
A	yeah but it's only cos I remember them now but like the hard ones I what is it? three six six
B	mm
A	so
B	I still can't do English Folk Song Suite like I think
A	well I
A	no because I practised it I went home and I did the whole thing and I was like
A	mm
B	the E flats like I always
B	well I used to pretend I was playing it
A	mm
B	I never did the E flats now I
A	mm
B	like I'm trying to play it
A	mm
B	and I'll look at over at
B	wiggling around
B	yeah
A	because I think even he can tell
B	yeah
A	that
B	what grade is she now? five?
A	four
B	no four
A	no
B	I've only done grade two four and five so I was grade four when I started wind band
A	yeah
B	no was still grade two
B	and I did my grade four in year seven
A	mm
B	mm mm?
A	when I did grade five in the
B	you did it in spring I did it in the summer
A	mm but then
B	yeah cos I don't like doing grades
A	so you got behind I don't like doing grades either except I get less nervous like with every grade I do actually no I don't really
B	mm mm
B	you can finish it
A	I was really nervous because
A	and and he was like
B	yeah that's right
A	the pieces aren't very good and then it was just it was really horrible I was really scared so I failed and my dad got really annoyed cos he had to pay for it
B	mm I didn't want to do my grade five then
A	I thought I was gonna fail
B	but you still did it
A	yeah you got the same as me
B	yeah
B	yeah same
A	and
B	I
A	I used to know them really well
B	oh I never used I never know my scales I haven't done them all summer so I won't be able to do any
A	well I dunno what it was but something just like like flicked cos before I was so bad at scales I failed
B	I've always got around thirteen no what's the pass?
A	for scales?
B	yeah
A	fourteen
B	oh so I always just passed
A	mm
B	so I got like fifteen or
A	I just never passed and he always used to slay me for it he used to be like you do not know how to do your scales
A	can't do it without the sheet
B	oh
A	that's why I was saying I can't do it without the sheet
B	yeah yeah but the problem is scales is like gets you easy marks
A	mm
B	so you really should practise them I just never can be bothered to practise them because scales are so always the boring
A	yeah
B	bit of playing a clarinet
A	and aural I was
B	yeah
A	awful at aural
B	I always used to be really good at the aural cos then it was just the easy questions like
A	mm
B	sing back and clap back
A	yeah no but I was always
B	like clap in time
A	yeah
B	and it's
A	yeah but I I was always really nervous and so they'd be like sing and I would just be like oh
A	was the bit I could always rely on and I'd be like
B	yeah
A	if I don't get anything right in this aural the clapping I've got the clapping and then it was like clapping was incorrect
A	it was so sad
B	I always get the beginning of the clapping and the end of the clapping right but never the middle
B	because well I always used to be fine in the earlier grades but like in my grade five the clapping is longer
A	mm
B	and I always forget the middle so I just make it up
A	mm
A	I don't actually think I'm gonna be able to take grade eight because if you look at the like the pieces are fine because you just learn to do the pieces like you can practise them
B	yeah
A	until you can do them and like scales but when it comes to the aural and stuff and the sight reading it's so hard
B	yeah then in grade eight aural is
A	er even in grade seven it's
B	it's
A	impossible all the stuff that I need to know he was like you need to know you need to be able to tell like what cadence it is? so if you say it's a perfect cadence you need to be able to say two to five or like whatever it is and then
A	how it's progressed
B	this is why I wish I'd done my grades with Trinity
A	yeah like it would be so much better
B	because you get
A	and you have to sing the bass part
B	the same UCAS points
A	yeah you have to sing the bass part of a melody
B	it's so annoying
A	they play you a melody and you just have to sing the bass and like you can't even hear the bass but
B	yeah I wish grades were just playing the instrument
A	mm
B	without the aural
A	even though that's not really like a
B	yeah
A	a
B	if the grades were like to show good a musician you are
A	yeah but I'm not a good musician I I can play it fine because I practise it but I don't actually know what I'm doing when it comes to all the technical stuff
B	yeah
B	it's like
A	but then why do I need to know my scales?
B	yeah how's because he must have got full marks in everything else
B	to be able to fail your scales and still get a distinction
A	mm
B	yeah but he goes so fast he's because he thinks it's easy
A	mm
B	it doesn't mean that everyone else thinks it's easy
A	literally he's just
B	so he's like
A	and Miss
B	oh we should be able to get over this theory in half an hour
A	yeah
B	let's just
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	we'll just be like what was that?
B	I have no idea what I was writing
A	you can text
B	yeah
A	alright
B	ask her
A	I really
B	hey
B	like the ensemble?
A	yeah like two clarinets and a saxophone
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	and
B	need to ask
A	yeah I was actually considering that I was like I wonder if
A	he would not do it with it
A	but
B	imagine if he did
A	yeah but that would be
B	we'll be like oh sorry we we're not having lunch today we're practising with
A	with
A	she'd be like can I come and listen? we'd be like no sorry yeah but how cool would that be like
B	yeah
A	I think clarinet
B	yeah
A	because then you have to
B	but also
A	really
B	people like when they're lower on
A	yeah
B	an instrument like the saxophone they just play really loud
A	I know
B	and they don't know how to go quieter
B	so it would be us like doing the whole
A	mm
B	quiet and then loud
A	mm
B	and then quiet and just
A	but what I wanna know is
B	well actually
A	well
A	she's scared
B	really
A	yeah
A	she's
B	really quiet
A	she's scared or everything Mr
A	and all the teachers are like there's no need to look so scared and she's like mm
B	yeah and then when you get to know her she's not actually that shy
B	so
A	but they're like and what's your name? and then even when we're in that room and they were like
A	it's like it's one note but I feel I wanna know how they actually mark that because
B	yeah I know
A	because what if say you were playing like
B	yeah
A	would they give you both
B	but that
A	the really bad mark?
B	if it's like a clarinet
A	yeah
B	so like if er we do it
A	mm
B	you will be really good I would be terrible
B	I can just pretend I'm you
B	and then they'll give me a great mark and give you a terrible mark
B	yeah I dunno it would be so
A	it's so confusing
B	much easier if we could just do one duet
A	yeah
B	and then send it off for both of us
A	maybe we can
B	yeah
A	but I really wanna do it before Mr
B	yeah
A	because no I guarantee no other new teacher that comes is gonna let us write a log give it back them they'll mark it and then give it back to us to rewrite it
B	I know
A	the
B	yeah I just oh
A	why does he have to leave like this I mean I can understand why he's leaving and he's got to leave like some year he can't
B	yeah I know
B	but like couldn't he just
A	mm
B	teach us in year eleven?
A	well he's doing part time this year as well
B	because then he wouldn't have to start yeah but is is he teaching oh yeah
A	he's going to some other
A	school like erm
B	yeah just to do
B	clarinet lessons
A	yeah
B	isn't it?
A	but he said they're really
B	oh my god
A	cos he was like it's like twenty percent more and they only get I was like oh er so is it longer lessons? he was like no the lessons are twenty minutes long
B	yeah in half an hour
A	it's over really quickly
B	like if I'm going a piece I'm struggling on or something I can just do one piece with
A	yeah
B	in half an hour
A	yeah
B	imagine having twenty minutes
A	I know and then
B	or like if I'm doing
A	yeah
B	I can just do aural
A	mm
B	and that's it
A	but it's like even the oh the pieces for grade seven are ridiculous like the study he gave me is
B	yeah
A	it's two pages long of these like chromatic things going down it's horrible
A	the jazzy piece cos he played it and he was doing all those like swings and stuff
B	oh yeah I have to do like a jazzy piece
B	for my
A	six
B	six
A	yeah
A	Romance do that that's really easy
B	Romance
A	yeah but Edward German
B	mm
A	I always did the Victorian
B	I'm doing
A	Kitchen Garden suite
B	Samba Samba
A	yeah
B	no it's like
A	did you do
B	I dunno
A	Voi Voi Che?
B	yeah
A	except when I said that she was like what's the name of your piece? I was like Voi Che Sapete and Mr
A	I'm like why but I'm not gonna say that am I? unless I'm
B	yeah
A	it's just like a
A	play this
B	yeah
A	well
B	you should choose to
A	no because then I was like maybe
A	like you don't have to do it with me
B	yeah so well
B	because I'm
A	well no
B	really badly
A	because then we'll practise
B	but then also you can't do an easy one because it needs to be like
A	yeah so we do a hard one
B	technically difficult
A	and we practise loads
A	and then it's really good
B	I need more than a year to practise loads
A	well we have
B	mm
A	it'll have to be like a grade seven piece
B	oh
A	but hopefully he can give us a duet
B	yeah
A	to do if he imagine if we were like can we do it in advance? he was like no
A	but I want to record
B	yeah er the good thing is that we have more than one
A	yeah and I hope we do the composition
A	as well
B	yeah genre composition
A	yeah and I wanna do it before you go to Spain because then I can just sit in the music
B	what when I'm in Spain?
A	yeah
A	but luckily they're not
B	mm
B	yeah I mean she's like oh I'm great at the piano
B	and then
A	the thing is though
B	erm the highest piece I've played is maybe erm I think it was a grade four
B	but I'm just I'm just not so into the grades
A	yeah
B	she's like erm er I promise I am good I really promise I'm
B	yeah
A	she's like my dad gives me grade six pieces so I'm like so have you done grade five theory? do you like
B	yeah exactly
A	and she's like so that means I'm a grade six I'm like well no hold your horses
B	and then in music when she was like erm so how do you do it for minors then? thinking that she was so cool and
A	yeah
B	that no one would know that but then everyone with grade five theory
A	yeah
B	which is like a quarter of us and
A	yeah
B	we already know how to do it
A	and then
B	and then he was like
A	mm
A	and I'm like what
B	it
A	a stupid question
B	yeah
A	in Monday lunchtime?
B	yes and then like
A	a hundredth time
B	and like
A	yeah
B	cos no offence to
B	three summer soirees
A	yeah and that
B	I mean it's good it's fun
A	funk time or whatever
B	yeah like the
A	did she like not change her pieces cos she's too scared that they're gonna be rubbish?
B	yeah
A	but I don't
B	and then she looked at me
A	that's what she was like
B	and then we carried on laughing
B	every time and she just looked at us and like
B	it's like what are you doing?
A	just because we're given this one-hour misery lesson
B	oh
A	music
B	yeah
A	cos I thought it would be easy I thought it would be like a bit of a
B	I know
A	relaxed
B	yeah because
A	yeah
B	it would have been easy
A	but then also
B	I know
A	AO1 AO2
B	as soon as he started
A	AO3 AO4 I'm like what's what
B	as soon as he started explaining it I thought we only had to do one performance
A	I know
B	and one composition
A	yeah
B	and then there's like
A	oh
B	dreading that
A	yeah
B	I'm so scared
A	thing is
B	like
B	to get having just a melody and then having to come up with a composition in forty minutes
B	and then perform it in five minutes
A	like why
B	yeah
A	or you can't get an A star
B	yeah but also be a hundred percent
A	yeah
B	for those two AOS one and two like the perform and compose log I mean no way are you are gonna get a hundred percent
A	no
B	for those
A	and
B	oh
A	but he marks them and he's like I'm a really tough marker and I'm like well that's great isn't it?
B	yeah
B	I'm gonna make sure you get a hundred percent but I'm a really tough marker
B	it's like
A	but surely he can just give us all those stars cos he marks
B	yeah
A	sixty percent of
B	yeah exactly
A	the exam
B	he could just say oh a hundred percent and a hundred percent and a hundred percent
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it looks more
B	whereas ninety-nine
A	dodgy
B	ninety-eight ninety-seven
A	yeah
B	ninety-nine
A	hundred
B	hundred
A	but I really am stressing out but hopefully if we can get
B	yeah but I don't think we're gonna do both compositions this year
A	mm no
B	I know
A	actually to be honest just composition sounds really hard
B	yeah
A	like just coming up with a piece just randomly
B	yeah how are you
A	yeah
B	or something to work on with that
A	you get nothing
B	like the one where you have to just compose for your instrument
A	yeah
B	without not the genre one the other one
A	yeah
B	that one how are you supposed to do that? there are so many possibilities I don't know what to do
A	but
B	I'll just end up like accidentally copying a piece that I always play
B	on my
A	but surely you could just a do a piece
B	yeah
A	and nobody would notice actually they would notice as long as you don't do a famous piece or just get him to compose a piece for you and you can play it
B	yeah yeah
A	but then also the one person on that thing that we were listening to he was doing like these really hard twiddly bits that he couldn't actually play I'm like why would you put in those bits if you can't play them?
B	yeah that was
A	yeah you can't make it too easy otherwise
B	I would make mine too easy
A	yeah I will make mine too easy it will just be like B G E B G
A	and then oh god and then that log as well he was like it's really simple you write about your composition I'm like what do you write about your composition?
B	and then write what you've added and why you've added it
A	yeah
B	you
A	what you're meant to write
B	I've added these twiddly bits
B	so it sounds like it's much harder than it is
A	twiddly bits to replicate the song of birds
A	in the morning in the
B	yeah
A	Samba district
B	and like film music when it's just but it's like
A	yeah
B	film music as my genre
A	no I'm doing
B	I'd love to like
A	a cappella
B	do
A	yeah something like African er what was it? African a cappella?
A	yeah but how would you do that? like composing it
B	I dunno
A	the notes
A	no you can do like a voiceover cos it
B	so like
B	yeah
A	no but do you actually have to record that one? yeah
B	yeah
A	no you don't
B	yeah I think so
A	because there's a
B	competition
A	erm the the group performance there's only two performances
B	yeah but I'm I'm sure you also have to record your compositions
A	oh yeah
B	cos like with the performance one you perform a piece
A	yeah
B	and then you compose a piece for your instrument and then you have to
A	oh perform that
B	perform that as well cos the ones we listened to were the compositions for their instruments
A	yeah but do you have to perform the genre piece?
B	I think so I don't know
A	yeah but
B	yeah I wasn't sure about those
A	she did like harmonies over the top yeah I'm not sure about their recording
B	yeah
A	to be honest it just makes everyone sound really bad like
B	yeah I know
A	the singers
B	cos it's
A	it's like echoey
B	yeah
A	and even
B	she didn't yeah
A	sound that great at all
B	she's a little bit
A	like
B	it just makes it all a bit too like
B	crisp
A	yeah
B	in a weird way
A	I didn't really like it
B	yeah
A	so
B	erm and that rock one with the person just playing the bass guitar and just overlaying it
A	mm and he gave it
B	I wasn't sure about that
A	full marks
B	and he was like oh I love this I gave this full marks
A	yeah
B	it's like mm not not quite the
B	so knowing me I'm gonna do one that I'm really proud and he's gonna be like mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	the performance one is the one that's the best one is the easiest one just your performance cos you can just do any piece
B	mm
A	yeah you could do one of your like grade six pieces
B	oh
A	cos you get marked up about how hard it is and how
B	yeah so I need to do like
B	a grade eight piece
A	or he said grade seven is
B	yeah
A	seven
B	so I need to do a grade seven piece
A	you can do a grade seven piece do the same piece as me
B	oh god
A	are you allowed to do that? do the same piece as someone else?
B	dunno I could just get you to record it and pretend it's me
B	we could
A	it's like seven pages long
B	we could like both record it
A	yeah
B	and then when everyone's gone home I can quickly change the title
B	and say that my one was yours and your one
B	was mine
A	no you have to dupe it so that we both have mine
B	no because then they'll know that it's the same so I'll just make yours mine
A	yeah but then
B	and mine yours
A	yeah but what if mm but what if yours isn't very good?
B	yeah that's the point
A	yeah but yours will be good so that's fine I'll have yours
B	no
A	don't you want me to have yours or
B	no it'll be terrible
A	no it will be good
B	no it won't
A	yeah it will
B	no it won't
A	no because the guy that
B	they are
A	no they're no I mean
B	yeah
A	but I can't play them
B	why not?
A	because I find them hard
B	yes
A	yeah but this is it but like
B	they're not hard but I find them hard
A	yeah but Mr
B	mm
A	I find everything hard
A	well Frère Jacques
A	do you remember when we did the composition and then you messed up the like timing? it was like
B	yeah cos I
B	I like erm
A	you tried to quantise it
B	was it I quantised them all
B	and all of them quantised right apart from one who like
B	they made it half time slower
A	mm and then you tried to do like the whole thing where you have to get it up and then try and like change everything
B	you were so mean
B	you just laughed at me
A	and and it was really
B	and it was just like Frère Jacques
B	it's not that hard
B	if I had just left it how I recorded it would have been more in time
B	than after I'd quantised it
A	it wasn't as bad as
B	that's a real compliment
B	with the
A	we were listening to
A	and we were like
B	mm mm well that's really good
A	really good
A	and then when we went off and did our little
B	I'm surprised she's not taking music
A	I know
B	I would have thought
B	er
A	and then we didn't even do that song
B	and we didn't even sing we
A	we didn't do anything
B	all of those things we didn't finish
A	we didn't do anything
B	like the other
A	we were basically like
B	one we had to do
A	we're too good for music
B	yeah
B	and we didn't even do it
A	because we basically just thought we were too good
B	cos we wasted we wasted half the time with
A	yeah
B	discussing who's gonna sing what part
A	to be honest now I don't feel so bad cos for being like no we don't really want to be with
B	what do you mean?
A	well you you were like we don't really want to be with you
B	yeah because they're imagine she'll think we're like best friends now
A	she thought I was her best friend in French cos I talked to her and then I realised that talking to her was a really big mistake
B	we'd never laugh at you how why? what kind of monster
B	do you think I'm am?
B	I would never laugh at you
A	and anyway you'll do so well because you're so clever
A	I was like cos Miss
A	and like we just like
B	I thought you had Miss
A	Miss nipple
B	Miss
A	yeah because she was the one doing my
