A	no no it doesn't go there
B	it doesn't go there
A	I'm not sure it goes there
B	oh I wouldn't do that if I was you
A	ah bore of the year
C	no
A	leave the other bit off that you just put on a minute ago
C	yeah okay alright
D	now are you timing?
A	it might it might go there but then again it might not you never really know
B	oh oh
D	are we timing him?
B	yeah he has got
E	are you
B	seven minutes and thirty seconds
E	oh no problem
B	and I have to see it completed
C	right where does the pink go?
B	as per the instructions
C	the other this arm that that's what's broke that's what's broken there would be an arm there yeah
B	yeah I'll accept that alright
D	yeah when did that break?
C	I don't know this one
D	it's there somewhere I've seen it
C	I have to get another ball oh there it is ah so let me see the ball thank you
B	three minutes for that
C	boot yep boots on there
B	I see bits over there
C	okay thank you erm
B	and I can see they're not in place
C	is that tub in there?
B	no
C	no
B	a third of your time is passed how do you feel?
C	right shut
C	shut up
B	do you feel like you've completed a third of the course?
C	yes
B	the thing is you wouldn't know because I didn't you can't tell how many
C	oh okay yeah and I remember that being on something like that
B	I would work faster if I was you
C	oh shut up
C	can I put that on there?
B	I think to take that as three
D	the penalty for not fulfilling the
C	I mean he owes me a pint anyway so
B	I owe him a pint so he's going to cancel that one
C	so this cancels the pint if I can't do it
unknown_female	that should be like that one
C	which oh there is meant to be a hand there's meant to be a tub on that there yeah maybe
unknown_female	pretty sure you're wrong
C	that look not sure about that
D	has the tub got a hole in it?
C	yes so it drops off of that so I think that's there
E	I think I'm not sure you need an elastic band I'm not sure you
B	no outside help
C	no no but I I can't lose on just on an elastic band
B	go and find an elastic band
C	er
B	but I don't think you need one actually it's cheating
D	that's not fair if it's not in the rules that he has to get the elastic band as part of the task
unknown_female	he has to do it to be complete
D	you should you should hold the clock while he goes
unknown_female	no I'll
D	to fetch an elastic band
C	I think here
B	oh you do need a
C	I'm confused about that one
B	someone go and find a rubber band for him
C	erm you were on there and we are up there
B	you've got the ball and the hand
C	that's the mouse for yeah so on the
B	you want the diver in a cage so
D	oh yes what's he going to dive into?
C	that goes like that onto
B	you've got five minutes half your time period has gone
C	alright alright
B	how do you feel?
C	very good thank you
B	you do feel good
E	we have a choice
D	his hair's looking nice isn't it?
B	it is looking very nice very ruffled
D	have you have you got any product in there or is that natural?
B	not
C	not since last
B	I can see grey hair
B	I think it's underneath there
C	erm
B	oh oh oh I know where that is
C	that must go up to that if I just hold it
B	how would it
C	mm how am I going to?
B	I can see several things wrong already
C	you're not oh yeah no I got it
B	no helping
C	I got it no no it's that which needs to be that way up no it's that way through there
D	so did you say you are going to take this back with you?
B	I'd do it this way
D	yeah
B	four minutes remaining
D	I think I can remember playing it at
E	oh I can definitely remember we definitely played it here quite a few times
E	mm
C	these are out there
B	a lot of thinking and not a lot of doing going on
C	don't know about that one
E	oh no that stop sign you've got to do that stop sign
B	three minutes remaining
E	I've brought you some elastic bands
C	oh okay that looks more
B	and then the whole thing falls over that's what happens then
C	no that's going cold
E	er no you can't tell him this you can't give him advice
B	I'm telling him it's wrong
E	you told us you can't give him advice
B	it's not advice I'm just telling him he's wrong
E	I wouldn't necessarily listen to him
B	a correct statement it's a fact
D	is there a picture anywhere to look at? oh
B	oh
B	I'm taking points off that
C	mm I know so that doesn't move there
B	you have three minutes remaining
B	how many fails
C	I don't
B	are likely between now and the end of time?
C	many more
B	many many more
C	that that seems like the right thing to do so that must mean that
B	you should feel it in your heart though
C	shut up
C	something along those lines don't know erm
D	I can hear a clock a church from here what's that?
E	whoops that's the cathedral
D	oh is it?
C	that definitely kicks that quite well
B	cheeky
C	oh god is there any of that? I can't work out
B	it's quite infuriating
D	how do you know if it's set up right?
C	cos when you pull this end it should go all the way out there
E	I think that elastic band is probably the wrong one
B	two minutes remaining two minutes remaining
C	well that's not that's not my fault
E	I brought you a choice
C	how how how long was there?
B	should have given him ten minutes
C	how long
D	he did this
B	should have fastened it down
C	or should it be?
B	he would've he would've lost a pound then
A	he's been very close to doing it but it's just not ah yeah no I think you might be getting getting somewhere now
C	oh no
D	whose is this?
C	no that's fine
E	it's a
D	oh is it?
B	I'm
D	uhu uhu
C	I can't work it out I'm afraid I just
B	mm you have one minute twenty-three seconds
C	cool
B	remaining
C	I can't I've given up
B	I will count down
C	alright then
B	you've given up do you want to give up?
C	no I don't
B	you said you've given up
C	no I haven't
D	kind of given up not quite you've
C	it's taxing on my brain
C	that must go on there
E	well
C	but it also goes but then how does that go?
B	one minute remaining
C	thank you erm
B	fifty-two seconds now remain
C	down like down like this
E	now no I think the thing is if you can't correct it
unknown_female	but he's got the instructions
E	oh no
unknown_female	he's been reading them
B	it's his challenge
D	well I think there is it just one drink that rests on it?
B	thirty seconds left
C	yeah and plus he already owed me a drink so I think you know fair enough
D	I think it
B	I've got myself out of buying him a pint so I feel quite well
C	just close that but
A	no no you can't
D	no cigar
E	no cigar
B	nine
E	I was going to say
B	eight seven six five four three two one
C	correct me then go on
D	there's the
C	correct me
B	right let's go from the start shall we? number one state aim set tabs at base range
C	no no you just no that's wrong I requested a
B	oh sorry
B	I'm gonna hit you if you do that
D	another five minutes is too long
B	the erm where's the bit?
E	you needed the other elastic band
C	but I needed well I needed two
E	no you don't you know you need a proper
B	you have to turn the thing and then it like winds it up and then you
E	and it goes between there and there
B	and then it hits that
E	and then when you turn the handle
C	ah I see
E	it goes wallop
A	that was very close
B	well now that now
A	having that spindle round the wrong side
B	I can
D	somebody gave him a booby-trapped rubber band
E	I couldn't no you need to go the other way
C	yeah that has to go in the proper
B	you fool
D	they probably didn't have these
E	other way
D	post office
B	other way
D	these post office rubber bands when this was made
C	so it's gonna do that and see
E	yes cos that didn't quite go right you've gotta
C	right
E	it's not latched in properly
C	there I think
E	that should be
C	something the other way that's more
D	or is it upside down no?
C	I think it's the right way up
E	I no I think that might be the wrong way actually
C	really?
A	it looks like it might be
E	if you take take the ball and the widget out
D	oh well
E	wee
D	the second part works as well then
B	so that's where the hand's meant to go
D	which way up does that stick go now?
C	oh right okay I see
E	I didn't think that was broken yeah
C	that goes on the end there
unknown_female	no it was broken
E	presumably there was something
C	might go simple as that
D	no we can't play it now cos the hand's broken
E	I didn't think it was broken before
D	mm
E	oh it's snapped hasn't it?
C	yeah oh well
B	right anymore
D	oh well that's the end of that then
B	anymore any challenges you have to do
C	oh no it's fine
A	you should have recorded that or are you recording it?
D	I am recording it
A	oh okay
B	recording what this?
D	mm
B	what just the talking?
D	mm
B	how entertaining
D	mm that's my project
B	what's your project?
D	erm doing tapes of people talking
B	why?
D	for the benefit of linguists at Cambridge University Press
B	er mm I know Cambridge
D	and Lancaster
B	sorry
D	and Lancaster University
B	oh Lancaster University
B	he said
D	did he?
A	there's a bloke at work who's called
A	with an R
B	slap round the face
A	Boocher Bacher
B	Barcher
D	but we could do something civilised so you could talk about your time in America that would be
B	that wasn't civilised
D	calendula
B	I don't know any flowers so I can't
C	were there any flowers at camp?
B	there weren't flowers in there
D	there were flowers of American childhood
D	mm
D	well anything really I mean actually they're particularly interested in the way that young
C	oh right okay well that was probably not a great example cos
D	immortalised forever
A	that's probably more more like your normal style of talking than erm than anything else really
D	they probably want the street talk or something you know?
B	come to
B	that's the biggest joke
D	or as close as I can get to it you know?
B	mm
D	I know a limited number of young people so
B	I don't think that's going too far
A	it's an MP3 not an MP4
D	that oh that's the joke that was so sophisticated I don't understand it
A	you should have been listening earlier when we had the conversation
E	about MPs
B	yeah getting old
D	oh I've forgotten already
D	my short term memory's gone
B	yeah
E	but tell us about the erm all equipment that they had or the different activities they could do
B	erm
D	you were in charge of the
B	uhu
C	what's all that then?
E	I think I'm not sure that that's
C	perhaps they're made the wrong way
E	well
C	it is
E	mm is there a second one? mm okay
B	and we had erm well I don't know about ten different things you could do maybe twelve something like that with the kids and they'd come in and like you'd have six periods a day and then they'd come in bunks and
D	uhu
B	erm
A	were they sort of regimented or could they could they roam free?
B	god no Christ
B	if they had free rein to they'd probably burn the place down
A	they they had to they so they had an hour an hour and a half to do something and an hour and a half to do something and then it
B	an hour
A	yeah so they just move so then you move five hundred kids from one place to another
B	no god no erm
D	not him personally no no
B	not all at once
A	no no no
B	yes
A	so then it's
B	they go on
A	or
D	so does everybody have a little schedule for the day?
B	er pretty much I but I was activity
D	mm
B	and the they wouldn't just appear I'd say there's more cabin counsellors than there were specialists but cabin counsellors they'd could go round with the kids
D	right
B	as they're doing the different things
D	uhu
B	there are the people that run the activities and the people that go with the kids and like supervise them during the day
D	and do you go round with the same bunch of kids all the time?
B	er
D	so then you go round with your other bunk mates or whatever else
B	yeah so you would go with your kids
B	you could have you could have anything from like four kids to like twenty
D	uhu
B	in one for one session and then they come to
D	we saw you having fun on the photograph
B	did she find some of me?
D	yeah well we had to look quite hard cos you were generally skulking at the back but
B	yeah I'm I'm that
D	in the first few days before the kids arrived when you were all being inducted or
B	oh yeah
C	we had two really good games one of which was spot
B	oh yeah
C	which didn't happen very often yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	there was one black kid in my bunk actually and he
C	in your bunk?
B	in my like he was in my
D	it's a hut yes it's their hut
A	okay right not in your bunk bed no
B	no
A	okay
B	so they're just called yeah bunks erm and he was annoying me the most
D	right
B	which didn't really help erm he was the best at basketball by a mile he was the fastest by a mile and the tallest and the strongest erm and he he didn't pay to get in it was like a er like a charity thing or it was like they'd had to raise money for him to go
D	oh right where's he from?
B	I don't know they're all the kids from New York
D	oh right
B	upstate
C	Upstate New York yeah
B	yeah
C	where this is
D	so
E	so he was the one it was one kid that got
B	yeah
E	subsidised did he?
B	yeah
D	right one bursary
E	that's terrible
D	one bursary amongst five hundred oh dear that must have been really expensive it must have really cut into their profits
B	yeah it really doesn't help when the other kids
D	did he feel out of place?
B	no I don't think he really noticed no one really made any jokes or anything
C	they're too young
B	yeah
E	oh no I'm sure they well no I'm sure they could have done but erm
B	oh yeah they made some jokes
E	were they really posh kids?
B	er
E	they must be really posh kids if their parents pay that much money
E	so they bring all their own stuff then?
B	yeah they come in and I've never seen so many bags of stuff in my life
D	and when we saw that photograph at the back of the gym
E	yes
D	where you were just
B	a pile of
E	a mound yeah
D	two mountainous piles of their gear that had turned up
B	and the girls' side ten times worse as well
E	I can imagine
B	yeah and then two of the kids we had the
D	really?
B	so and like and they were hard to pick up
E	did they send anything to wash or did they just they they wore all their clothes?
unknown_female	I'm sure they didn't send children
D	even there were four of them
B	the there they would wear everything once and then put it in the wash
D	oh well there we are
B	they'd wear it for like an hour and they'd put it in the wash erm and on laundry day we used to we'd been we'd dump all the clothes in the middle and they all had name tags on so you just pick clothes up find a name and chuck it on their bed and
D	that's a child's name begin with C
B	yeah and he would be sat on his bed and not fold any of his clothes and we'd throw clothes at him and the pile would be bigger than him like by the time we finished and it we'd have to do it for him cos he was so slow and useless
D	ah
B	he was yeah just one of the funniest kids you just wanted to laugh out like he was incredibly uncoordinated and quite fat and short and had this blink he had this twitch whenever he'd blink his whole face twitched he'd blink there
B	and it was one of the funniest things to see ever
E	well she probably was in the first place but
B	well I I don't know
E	then realised and then
B	anyway you hear about the the kid what it he he has two mums the twins have two mums and they're they're both quite nice but the dad was just trying to play sports with them and they came the day after cos obviously they didn't want to see each other erm I remember coming back and it
D	perhaps he's living in hope that one day he'll just you know
B	he'll catch it
D	yeah it'll just click and
B	it's like ah
E	maybe that's it maybe he's just persisting until he does the once and then he can stop dammit I'm going to keep trying
B	yeah and then
D	perhaps he should buy him a pair of spectacles or something
B	the other the other twin is definitely gay and likes theatre and also had no interest whatsoever in sport and the dad's trying to push him and it's just funny to watch
D	er that poor dad's outnumbered terribly in his family isn't he really?
B	oh yeah his he's he's been taken out royally
D	or lose the wicket
B	it's quite entertaining yeah they were mad I remember one of them
E	probably more coordinated than you think he is
B	no no most definitely not I don't I have no idea how he got up there
E	perhaps they shoved him up there and left him there
D	they shoved him up there and left him
B	that may well have happened I mean it wouldn't surprise me
D	no
B	and he was up there pretending to do Spider-Man like that with his like hand like this but no one in particular and he just
D	oh no poor little thing
D	but then if you're a parent and you logged in every day like to look at the photographs to see how it and then you see your child
C	I don't think that like I don't think that probably would have gone on it
B	no
D	you see your child sort of here
B	oh he was a happy kid
D	was he?
B	he was a happy kid yeah
D	oh thank goodness for that
B	he's just blissfully unaware of how
D	oh is he? oh well now that's really good I think because it would be awful to see your child being really miserable
B	he's a really happy kid he just loves life in general he's very happy I remember we were bowling er for one of our evening activities all the juniors went bowling sort of like I don't know forty fifty eleven-year-olds who went bowling together and I
D	oh
B	in the gutter and he's standing there
E	hoping
B	he's watching it go down the gutter and
D	oh no
B	and I'm thinking like oh what oh this is going to be bad this is going to really bad and it's going to hit nothing and he's going to start crying and it's going to be really bad but the ball just rolls down and rolls down really fucking slowly
B	and he's sat there and look looking at it and it goes past it and it doesn't hit a single thing and he pauses for a second and I'm like shit here shit's going to hit the fan in a second and he just and he goes
B	and it's beginning to move and he's getting two fingers like this and he's just like
B	with this little fat body and like walking around like this
D	ah
B	and he went like that and he turned around and he ran at me and just I nearly got it and I'm like yeah you nearly did
B	and I was crying with laughter I was absolutely holding it back so much oh my god
D	oh that's terrible
B	and he went on his little merry way to do something
D	but then erm
E	oh god might have been blimey how long ago was that?
D	well in our youth obviously
C	in our youth
D	in our youth there's this bloke that's just got married to Kiera Knightley and I once went on a date with his dad which ended in tragedy because we went bowling and he was so disgusted at how bad at bowling I was that he stopped speaking to me after about half an hour and didn't speak to me for the whole rest of the evening
E	oh really I?
D	and I never saw him again
A	well no she didn't get married er Kiera Knightley
C	oh sorry
D	no
C	I was not following
D	no
C	alright
D	or
A	he was
D	or indeed to his dad
A	she went on a date
D	a double date
A	a double date
D	it think was it with you?
A	with the father
E	I don't remember that
D	was it you and
A	of the man who is now married to Kiera Knightley
C	oh okay alright
E	er
D	well it's best erased from the memory I think
D	as I said I mean he was
C	I'm sorry
B	exactly
D	well I feel like that little boy
B	he's actually incredibly happy
D	with his with his balls going down the gutter
B	I remember one time when he didn't
D	but I didn't
E	what am I looking at?
C	the bottom one the technical one
B	we were doing the clean up once and the kids had these little sock cages they'd be like cotton like a cage you can keep your socks in and zip them up so you don't lose all your socks when they go to the laundry and you can just shove the whole thing in
D	ah yeah
B	it was quite a handy little thing it was about this big and it's a cylinder shape and it's got a zip round the middle and it was like he was folding towels in the back cubby and he'd been doing it for about two minutes and he like can I have a break? I'm really tired and I'm like yeah sure do what you want for a minute and I'll come back and we'll do that in a minute and I come back about five minutes later and he's lying face down on the floor like this and he there's like a little elastic thing on the back which you can like strap onto stuff and he
D	oh
B	and so he was just
B	strapped to his face
D	ah
E	the things you have
B	it was really funny
E	have to resort to to entertain yourself whilst left alone
D	well he's he's
B	oh
D	seriously stuck in your memory anyway this lad
B	it's something like and the I don't know if you've seen the latest Shrek
D	ah
B	and we decided that we all wanted to
D	well perhaps he'll be a famous comic in the end
A	or dead at the age of sixteen
B	it think it's more likely
A	hanging in his garage
B	he's obviously very very overweight and very slow
D	oh and he'll in fact he might turn out to be really handsome and famous or something I mean
B	no no
B	just no
E	sort of turn from the ugly duckling into the white swan
D	mm
C	Neville Longbottom
B	I wouldn't see
C	if you've seen the Harry Potters and the difference between him in the first film and him in the last film
E	well he's about twenty-five in the last film I think isn't he?
B	mm
B	spooky
A	I did think of coming to offer you some help
C	yeah
A	but then I passed on the thought
A	it's the thought that counts though
C	yes indeed
C	very grateful anyway
A	that's alright no worries
B	oh right yeah we after camp a lot of people tend to go we went to New York City for two nights
D	oh yeah yeah
B	like
D	spending all your hard-earned cash
B	oh every single actually I got ten dollars in all after spending
D	when you change that's probably worth a couple of quid
B	I think it's a couple of quid erm
D	and this is all
B	yeah
D	two quid
E	that's a big
A	how much did they pay you?
B	eight hundred dollars
A	do you have to pay for
B	well
A	accommodation and everything?
B	basically I no I
A	alcohol
B	yes
A	okay
E	yeah and of course he isn't twenty-one yet so of course he's not allowed to drink so
A	yeah right
B	yeah well there are ways and means
C	as if that didn't happen
B	there are ways and means
E	mock
B	erm er
D	yes
B	and erm apparently Frank Sinatra used to party there
D	mm
B	when he was erm when when
C	alive
B	when he was yes
B	just so the rumours go but it is actually a well it's all founded on a newspaper or something like that the local newspaper
C	oh right
B	erm and we stayed there for five nights
C	yeah
B	er
D	oh really?
B	so that was a lot of fun I don't think I've drank so much in my life for five days
D	good well your mother will be pleased to hear that
B	yeah but again I'll be in five days so
C	no and there's and the opportunity to do that
A	well mainly because I've never drunk as much in five days in my life
C	no you're not it's not even going to no it is the right way
unknown_female	like that?
D	it looks too full
C	oh
B	so yeah that was a lot of fun
C	that doesn't work very well
B	it was just the beach was right two like one block away erm so about fifteen metres away and it was such a nice beach
D	mm
B	and we just kind of
D	so was it like work or was it like like was it work being at camp? was it like
B	it doesn't feel like you're doing
D	it just feels like
C	I didn't go to work

E	and broke a girl's legs
C	you've got all these kids calling him Dr Snappy and they've no idea why

C	a Greek island with friends and er it was a nice place
B	yeah
C	it was a very stereotypical
A	yeah you got a good tan by the look of it
C	yeah
E	well er that's cos he wasn't out during the day
C	I know
E	he was very sensible and stayed out of the sun
B	okay
B	that's what happened
C	god yeah no there wasn't a day
E	did it?
C	yeah I mean we we went to bed at six and we had to catch our bus the other side of the island at eight o'clock and most people just couldn't hack it at all
E	oh dear and then
B	that was a horrible bus journey those were hard like rickety and
C	yeah
E	were you there? didn't know you went
B	no yeah I didn't
E	no? you went before?
B	no basically just not exactly
E	oh tell
C	er okay so yeah we erm obviously have being the really responsible people we are thought mopeds were the best option for us
B	mm
C	there
B	mm
C	guys and erm ten of us hired peds and we did a little mini tour around the whole of the island erm which was really nice actually erm er I decided to get sort of get the hang of it a bit cos the guy would just
B	how much were they?
C	work it out yourself erm I think it was about eighteen euros for a day something like that
B	for a day?
C	yeah it was really good
B	did you have to fill up the petrol or not?
C	yeah but I mean you get to the petrol station and be like fill up the tank please and then they'll be like two euros and so like okay then that's fine
C	and you just hand over two coins and and you're off yeah
C	I even got one for free because it was so not worth the money like the the she was just like that's like seventy-seventy erm cents so just don't worry about it
C	erm yeah no we we went er across the island which is is really small to this little beach we just sort of pootled along doing whatever we really wanted sort of saw
B	and trying to knock each other off
C	well
C	no we were trying fairly hard not to actually but some people are just incapable of using a moped but like just
C	we'd get to
B	it's so nice good hangover cure definitely did you have gyros?
E	I just I don't like it
D	yes
C	oh yeah I had gyros every day
B	oh gyros yeah
C	what?
B	gyros alamo
E	yes
C	yes no like no yeah it well I needed it really well I
C	we genuinely did yeah so then had gyros during the night
B	gyros is great
C	it is great but I can't just eat gyros erm
E	what is gyros?
C	a kebab
A	oh right
B	we'd get
C	but they had it was two euros
B	cone things
C	at the local one which did deliveries
C	so it was a two-minute walk from the hotel but we got a delivery to our rooms
C	so this little man just hops on his ped for about thirty seconds and he comes then he comes to the hotel and gives it yeah erm
B	as you do
C	mm?
B	as you do
C	well no we just wanted to explore the island really erm and ended up on a sort of tiny little dirt track going up this little going yeah going up a mountain which was really nice just really focussed on the film camera so I hope I should get some back what's the date today? twenty-third
E	you see there's another person sending their film off to be developed
B	mm yeah
C	what you were talking were you talking about that earlier yeah?
B	yeah
E	some
C	well I gave I gave him my camera bag to take to America and then I borrowed mum's old one for the
A	mm
C	erm and a little sort of herd of goats sort of roaming around at the top which was really nice I mean it did the chapel did look a bit sort of the place a monster would take a a body
C	but it was like it there was a four by four sort of truck down at the bottom and then we got to the top and there was a couple of car batteries and some fags just lying around the this chapel
unknown_female	the torture place
C	yeah exactly that's what we
E	oh right
C	yeah and so we were a bit like oh okay then erm but but the scenery was absolutely stunning I got some really nice shots or I think I did erm
unknown_female	that
C	yeah hope you got all the
E	then well you're discovering one of the pitfalls of film
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
E	so like you didn't load the damn thing properly and you've got thirty-six black frames
C	yeah
B	or else on the other hand that you don't get round to getting it developed cos you've still got three shots to go for
E	yes six months
C	yes exactly and you've got to wait for you to
B	what is on this film?
E	I've got I've still got some films where I was like I'm sure I've got one or two knocking about the place
D	well what they're from well from some time in the last thirty years
E	it'll be be a surprise
D	yeah
C	so after that we just sort of headed home and erm er on one of the main roads really it was quite fun and then the big hill which we went back down a big main road and
D	oh
E	straight down the hillside
C	oh no this wasn't like it was it was
D	and hairpin bends
C	it was straight
D	even better
C	it was a straight wide sort of boulevard sort of road erm into the
B	you didn't try hard enough
E	some people fell off didn't they
C	well actually four of us fell off like me being one of them erm mine wasn't too bad we were up heading up over one of the sort of passes you know mountains it was erm and on the side there was just some gravel and we stopped there
C	yeah
B	it didn't hurt a lot
C	yeah yeah he didn't well he didn't really notice he was like erm he
unknown_female	oh
C	that wasn't the little finger that there that wasn't straight at all it was like dipped
A	mm
E	mm
C	then he realised he'd shattered it in five places
C	erm they went to the erm hospital and they bandaged him up for four hundred and fifty pound and so then it was like
E	and did they not do more than just bandage him for four hundred and fifty pounds?
C	er well he had I think he had an x-ray and he had to get a really big
A	he would have had E EHIC card or whatever they're called
C	oh no he he had erm insurance
A	okay
C	he got the money back
A	okay
C	but he originally I mean they you pay the money and then they give you it later
A	okay
C	erm so yeah so he was
E	so he got spaced out?
C	yeah well a little bit but I mean just like he couldn't really drink really
D	oh god
B	did it stop him?
C	er no not really
B	obviously not
C	erm
B	actually
C	yeah oh no yeah you can't drink when you have that and you can't
B	yeah and he had like one beer and he was spaced out on the floor really funny
C	yeah
B	mm
C	mm no well he had one or two beers only had one or two and then he was flaked out on the floor it we didn't do anything to him but he was
E	acne medication?
C	yeah
E	really?
C	well yeah
E	can't they make something for teenagers where you can drink I just thought that was a bit
C	whoever you are
E	you probably can
C	well no it just ends up
D	well I know but why? what's the point in?
C	no it depends on the strength of the spot cream that I was given
D	right
C	cos I was on the highest ones will not let you have any alcohol at all cos they're such they're so they're so powerful
D	well that's just they should make it that you can drink
C	used to be on it for a little bit
D	mm
C	then decided against it
B	have a good drink
A	he'd rather drink than have good skin?
D	ah yeah now that's terrible dilemma
A	oh okay
C	or just do something it's like he's been down to the Chinese place down the
D	oh has he?
C	yeah he's done he's got a load of stuff from there and
E	so has it it's made it I I saw I saw him the other day and I actually thought it it was looking alright actually
C	yeah he's better it's better better now yeah but he has to do
E	is it one of those solutions
C	yeah it might be actually but it was like oh the herbal tea yeah
E	it looks like something you've swept up out of the garden
C	mm
E	yes
C	and yeah he had to do a herbal tea thing which was twice a day and it was absolutely horrible it was so awful and
E	you had to do that once didn't you?
C	yeah
E	trying to get rid of your cough
C	it wasn't very nice yeah erm yeah so that was a good holiday
A	mm sounds it
C	and we did I mean we did the activities that you should do I mean we weren't being so so typical that we slept through every day and just went out at night like on four of the days we did different things like we did
E	yeah
D	mm
C	cos you're just boiling yourself even more erm
A	I
E	sleep all
A	to sleep all day
E	to sleep all day
A	yeah
C	yeah no exactly
A	go go to Birmingham you know?
B	Birmingham would be a shit night out
E	er no if you
B	Birmingham's horrible
E	well if you just as as you all know your your
A	no I like doing stuff I like doing stuff
B	I like doing stuff as well
A	and I like getting drunk as well l mean it's not I've got no problem getting drunk but I I can't see the point of going somewhere different
B	mm
A	and not seeing it
E	pay and paying a lot of money not to see it
D	we when we went
B	we've seen what's out there though
C	we we we got a did a cruise as well it was a cruise sort of thing as well it wasn't a booze cruise but it was actually a fairly sort of cultured
A	mm
C	three-day cruise or whatever so we did snorkelling went to a little island town
A	sounds nice
C	it was quite nice yeah but I mean it took its toll on a few of us cos erm
C	it was an eight-hour thing and there was no real shade
E	help me I'm wilting
B	especially the pensioners
C	and so so a couple of the guys who couldn't really take the sunlight would just sort of wrap themselves in a towel
C	and just sort of sit there with sunglasses like this and just
D	what just cos they're vampires or something?
C	no cos
B	it's cos they
E	oh that's it
B	and had to go on a sunny boat for five hours in the day
C	my friend
C	he really can't take it at all
E	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah they wouldn't be like that apart from me and
C	mm
B	every time
D	well he managed in Barcelona last year didn't he?
B	oh
D	didn't he?
B	he was alright he went er he went to Mexico this year and he's done alright
E	they should be warmed up by now though shouldn't he?
B	his freckles just multiply by a lot
E	and make up
B	and that's really and that's about it really he does normally burn a lot
E	oh he's been very busy where did he go in Interrailing?
C	er well literally everywhere in Europe you can think of but Budapest Berlin Amsterdam literally like everywhere just stayed in Europe for a month in total he spent a grand and a half I think
C	which actually isn't that bad for a month Interrailing
B	for a month in Europe
C	that's actually quite good
D	it is a bit expensive though
C	er yeah a bit
E	so it's
C	no hostels most of the time
E	gosh but that's meant to be cheap
C	well yeah but
E	eating out I suppose
C	yeah
E	and I suppose that eats a lot doesn't it? eating out
C	a whole month though
D	yeah and if you're having to buy three meals a day practically or you might get breakfast at your
E	hospital?
D	yes
C	it's just like
D	and all the costs
E	yeah
D	and all the drinks and all
C	it's like and the food that we got given in Serbia from the orphanage put it that way
B	well like he had to buy a like train pass as well
C	yeah
D	that sounds like an exciting holiday going to Serbia to stay in an orphanage
E	it was a rugby tour
D	was it? oh right
C	erm yeah our first first morning and they had a this fish which didn't really look like fish and
D	for breakfast?
C	no sorry it wasn't breakfast sorry erm yeah I think it was just lunch and erm
D	mm well thank goodness for that
C	and I didn't realise that everyone else was going nowhere near it and took one bite and it was like oh no got food poisoning for like a day and a half
D	oh no
C	and we're doing well that day as well we're doing the open tour
C	so I threw up over the side
C	into oncoming traffic which was
D	oh oh
C	the the more entertaining part of it
D	oh oh
E	I bet everybody else was drenched
C	so yeah that was a bum
D	caused a crash behind the bus
C	mm
E	as someone desperately tried to avoid a barf all over the windscreen
D	oh my word
C	so yeah so I didn't really enjoy the tour as much as I probably should but erm
D	no that's grim that's horrible to poison you
C	luckily yeah luckily I was alright to play rugby over the next few days so er but I definitely needed that out of my system whatever it was
D	oh and were you alright the next day though?
C	yeah I was fine yeah
B	I've played more of my best games when I've had a really bad hangover
C	er no hangovers and rugby for me just do not mix at all
E	but there was that guy on your side when you were playing
C	yeah
E	and he had a bit of a heavy night out the night before and had to came came off the pitch halfway through the game
D	you'd get told off for leaving the pitch without permission are you allowed to wander off the pitch and go?
C	yeah
D	you are?
C	just means you're well you're a man down which is really
C	inconvenient for your friends who have to work a lot harder in your absence
E	that's
D	oh yes right okay
C	yeah
C	it was absolutely hilarious to watch he did actually he managed to catch number one because he did and made a decent run
D	is he on YouTube now with that?
C	no I don't think anybody videoed it should have done
