A	yeah we were organising the Uzbekistan I think
B	oh okay yeah
A	but it turned out it's didn't need to do it
B	no
C	were you doing visa applications?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sent off forms for that
C	how much did ah how much does the visa application put you back?
A	it varies but erm
B	Russia's a bitch
C	how much was Russia? don't go Russia
B	about a hundred and forty quid I think it worked out
C	one forty?
A	but that's so we can go in twice cos we need to go twice
C	ah single visa's expensive though
B	cos they charge a flat fee like thirty-nine pound like embassy fee for them actually doing it
C	typical yeah
B	yeah the fucking postage is a killer
A	oh yeah
B	seven quid to send it special delivery
C	seven quid?
B	to send a a large letter like thick like two passports thick seven pounds
C	yeah?
B	and you you put a return in it
A	yeah
B	so that's the seven quid
A	and that's just like monetary value I mean we spent like half an hour in the post office trying to sort this out
A	it we had like four trips to the till
B	yeah we we had to buy a postal order
C	postal order?
B	like yeah like you pay the post office money and write it down in like a post office it's like a it's like a cheque from the post office
A	it looked like monopoly money
C	yeah
B	they they look outrageous
A	yeah
B	it's this flimsy it's like a cheque's legit it's like it's got the bank name on it's not like post office crap
A	yeah
A	very strange
B	it is weird like
A	and we like just wrote our names on the back of it as well like very amateurish so I was like
B	yeah
C	fucking hell
B	labelled to the embassy of Uzbekistan
A	this has been on ah it's so good
C	sorry mate
A	you need to see em when are they in
C	I don't know I wouldn't know
B	well they they're not but
C	they're not
A	they they they just done their like tour for their album
B	a big one
C	yeah
B	yeah we should definitely try and see them
A	yeah
C	but where?
B	wherever
A	yeah
B	Kazakhstan maybe
A	all the big names go to Kazakhstan
B	yeah
C	I reckon if you go through Germany
B	it's likely to be that area is isn't it?
A	yeah
B	Germany France
A	we could even do it dunno cos we could get like some wi-fi or something somewhere in Estonia Latvia cos it won't be Estonia
C	won't won't be Estonia Latvia
A	Latvia Latvia's closest to Estonia
B	on the I thought on the way back
A	on the way back would be good
B	that'd be good no time pressures
A	yeah that's what was thinking
B	you can go wherever you want to
A	and then just see what's on in the big places
B	that that and it's summer it's like gig season
C	yeah yeah
A	well it's festival season
C	go to a festival
A	go to a festival
A	we're we're already camping anyway might as well
A	just let us in this festival
B	I've already got some colour
C	I know mate
A	what? live in
B	had my roof down mate
B	some UV rays
C	oh yeah
A	and er
B	it's impressive like how you just need a little bit of sun but if you're in it
A	and then
B	you you'd be hot be hot
A	I was like ah bloody hell open the window
A	it was like ah
B	but as soon as that sun goes it it's absolutely freezing
A	yeah
B	that's the game we play
C	the northern game
A	tell you what though people in
C	mm?
B	oh what walk on the road?
A	yeah who walks on the road?
B	it's like it's like it's on campus it's a turning off the main road it's like cos there's parking on the other side that you pull in to
C	right
B	and erm it's quite a it's it's a busy road just cos there's a there's a Spar
C	mm
B	then there's a path
A	Spar?
B	but like a central
B	is it
A	yeah
B	it's a
C	oh right
B	it links to like all the other accommodation that road
C	really?
B	it's like the direct route so everyone walks on the road but they don't move for cars
A	yeah like I I had my reverse lights on
C	yeah
A	obviously just about to reverse and some some person just walked past on the phone
C	not giving a shit
A	could have ran her over but I didn't
B	decided not to kill her then
A	usually I'm knocking three people over
A	I I could do though legitimately just knock a few people over easy
B	I've taken to I I watched some like their called motor
C	yeah yeah
B	I watched some of them like if they're if like pedestrians are crossing where they shouldn't be there aren't
B	so I I've taken to doing that in my car if someone's
B	it just pisses me off like just wait for the light then
C	go to a crossing
A	like you're a pedestrian you're very
B	yeah
A	don't walk in front of a car
B	you're not going to win
C	but if you hit them you're in the wrong
A	I have a camera
C	oh you have a camera?
A	yeah to laugh about it afterwards
A	in slow motion
B	cold playback
C	hey dickheads
A	I was on
B	fuck me
C	candles
A	candles
B	right
A	or something like that erm and people have to have like dash cams
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	because there seems to be a a load of people just jumping in front of cars
A	just to try and get run over
C	I think I've seen a video of that
A	but not like they don't jump in front of them at eighty they jump in front of them at like five miles an hour
C	yeah
A	and I saw one guy like the guy had stopped in the car erm sort of faster than he thought he would and the so to make it look like he'd been hurt more he sort of just like just sort of smashed his head against the er against the bonnet and just sort of hit the ground
A	it was like what are you doing?
C	claims them claims
A	yeah
C	jesus
A	yeah very strange
C	no one can get me
A	what are those things?
B	them? er one is a aerosol canister for like a a
C	no those furry like

A	oh fair enough
C	little like little Teletubby balls
B	Telly what? what?
C	where have you go that?
A	which episode of the Teletubbies you watch?
C	I'm just thinking I'm just thinking of a Teletubbies sun from
B	yeah let's just admit it now
A	like
C	like I know
A	Ipsy Dipsy was it?
C	don't think I've watched enough Teletubbies to know what you're meaning
B	no I I don't remember that but you seem awfully bitter about it
C	yeah
A	well I'm also bitter because erm I used to love Teletubbies until they did a double episode and I was expecting something to happen a program I wanted to watch that was going to come after but then I realised it was a double episode and I got very annoyed
C	double episode?
A	and I had to wait another half an hour to see like Basil Brush or something
C	you got more Teletubbies but you were pissed that you got more Teletubbies?
A	yeah but I was expecting Basil Brush
C	you Basil Basil Brush
A	Basil Brush is better than Teletubbies
C	Basil Brush was the shit
A	it was the shit
B	yeah I used to watch it
C	Basil Brush?
B	but was it the shit?
A	that's where I got my viewer from
B	if you could go back in time would you do it differently?
A	watch more Basil Brush less Teletubbies
C	did we say that
B	yeah cos well I don't know
C	don't know
A	let's be fair though
C	that's being fair
B	it's being fair
A	to be fair you're on your first drink as well
B	let's be fair to him
B	you are
C	it's me dickheads
A	you're on our turf mate
C	I'm what? our our
A	yeah to be fair I I'm on your turf
C	mm
B	yeah but we're in the same like you know we're in the same field so
A	same county
A	Lancashire
C	a whole new world
A	sorry different flight now the North
C	aye fuck me it's cold
A	I do miss living in a house
C	oh yeah you're back at uni er flats aren't you?
A	yeah it's like too samey
C	too samey yeah I prefer a house
A	it's very stale
B	it's nice having a lounge that you can actually like socialise in
A	I I didn't use the lounge at
C	what?
A	you'd have to get through it you need to
B	I I never broke that I never went through the wall the the amount of just these sofas like from the seventies or the eighties
A	they weren't very good
B	judging by the pattern and the lack of cushioning
A	oh yeah the springs had given way
B	yeah you you went in it was like
A	there was one seat in the middle of the coach like a three-seater the middle one you had to get like pulled out of like it was that bad
C	student houses
B	but like people used to use the same blanket every night
A	no
B	it was just a
A	he he would but he he'd do it every two weeks and he'd leave it on the floor over night
B	ah he'd get in like night's out and it would get passed around and
A	the slugs
B	oh the slugs it was damp
A	yeah so I I
C	so dank in this fucking house christ
A	not visible damp
C	I know
A	but you could it was like damp that you could smell which is the worst
B	yeah
C	oh
B	if you went down the air changed
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	even with if the door was open for like an hour two hours it would still make no difference at all
C	fuck
B	it was great when you
A	yeah
B	it was a good room for that
A	yeah
C	yeah nobody really cares
B	yeah you don't care do you?
C	yeah know what you mean
A	but my laptop got broken in that room
B	yours?
C	yours?
A	yeah remember my black one
C	oh before your Mac?
A	yeah did I get like I I I sort of gave it to the lounge just for like an all-round computer to play music off
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm like going on Youtube and stuff to get stuff
C	yeah
A	and then
A	just fucked it up
C	that was it game over
B	who's who's proper laptop broke though? was it
A	who do you reckon's at fault here?
C	ah
A	erm
C	right
A	so
C	two
A	did yeah erm so erm so we go on a night out
C	right
A	erm and there's drink left on the table from the night before
C	yeah
A	and then I think
C	is is was that
A	so yeah yeah
C	so it's his it's his fault cos he left the Carling he left his laptop
A	I I I'm on that side
B	I'm on that side as far as the laptop but not the can
C	yeah he did leave the laptop in a precarious place
A	he okay so it's a case of the laptop not
B	in in in the
C	yeah you want to put it like somewhere else
B	I'd never leave something there in in that lounge
A	personally I wouldn't either but I I think the leaving the can of Carling which is pretty much full he's only just opened it and just left it
C	but that could very well be unintentional when you're you're in a state or being drunk you can easily easily
A	oh yeah yeah but then it's the next morning like it's the next it's the next evening like he's had time to look at it think that's my can I'll just go and put it in the sink
B	yeah
C	but yeah equally so is everybody else
B	when the lounge is probably a mess
A	oh yeah yeah I mean like if if if I left a drink there and I came down the next morning and I saw it I'd be like ah go and tip that tip that down the sink
B	yeah I mean if it's
A	but I think the coupling factors of him not moving his drink and also leaving his laptop just in that state
B	yeah the laptop not being in a safe place is the main thing
A	yeah
C	yeah it's his own fault really
B	it's not
C	yeah
A	yeah he's still got the same one he just replaced the motherboard
C	fucking hell replaced the motherboard
A	it's a bit expensive but er if it was me I would have just bought like a cheap one
B	mm it's not cheap
C	shit
A	two hundred and fifty
B	did you pay for yours?
C	pay for my what?
B	replacement board?
C	no I I just sold it
B	oh oh your Mac
C	yeah I just sold it for spares and pairs
A	how how much would it have been?
C	what do you mean for to repair?
A	really? god
C	battery was fucked hard drive was fucked motherboard was like gone chips were soaked and er everything was sticky wasn't me
A	it's to be expected
C	I know right? apparently so erm but then you know that happened so I was like fuck it I just
B	weren't you using it as the DJ?
C	yeah
B	yeah I mean it's another sad thing
A	full blame
C	it was my own fucking fault
A	yeah when when I heard that's how it happened I'm just like yeah
C	yeah that's that's your own fault yeah
C	no sympathy there
A	I've I've never seen the picture of you so happy at the start of the night
C	yeah
B	I I can see that right now as well
A	yeah
B	you're just like you're behind your little cell you've got your Mac you've got your speakers
A	two speakers at the side Mac was in the middle
B	and then it looks it looks the shit but when when you aren't six feet higher than everyone else
B	yeah that's your problem
C	that's when it goes downhill
B	that face is quality isn't it?
C	give it another look
B	it's I was so glad I found this
A	I don't think I've ever seen that
B	probably not

A	yeah the mouth is off centre
B	we should attach a do you have to fill out a form for each recording?
A	yeah
B	we should attach a picture to it
B	so they can get in on the joke
A	do you reckon they'd like it?
B	to listen to all these you've got to have a bit of a sense of humour I think
A	yeah well I think they've just got to transcribe it so
C	yeah
A	I'm not sure how much humour has to go into it
C	what's the original?
A	I'm sure they must hope for for the reverse
A	yeah
C	that's the original
A	yeah you cropped it
C	I know right?
A	why why am I doing that face?
C	you couldn't see I reckon

B	this is the best one
B	ah everyone just went mental at that one
A	yeah I didn't really see what the big deal was before I saw it live and then I was like
B	no you have to it
A	yeah
B	to realise the
A	I had last coke in last time but I think I need more like
C	it's it's the Russian standard mate it's not ain't Gregas ain't no Gregas
A	it's sad that you can't have Gregas all the time
C	mate? just fucking stupid I can't I get why it's so expensive but it's still it's just painful
A	does anyone know what they do to it? cos I I didn't know I didn't know French were meant to were so good at wine at wine er
B	yeah
C	wine and cheese mate wine and cheese mate
A	yeah they get wine and cheese but I didn't know they get vodka
C	I don't know actually
A	I had erm we were in Paris and my dad got erm goat's cheese have you
C	yeah yeah yeah goat's cheese is nice
C	I like it do you not like it? what the fuck's up with you?
A	I had it and I it I thought I was
C	are you
A	he says yeah he said have it it's really nice and like it goes once it's not hot it goes very sort of like hard and it it's like clay
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and he gave me like a bit of that and I tasted it and then I immediately wished I had never even put my fork in it
C	goat's cheese doesn't melt it doesn't melt
A	does it not?
C	I swear it doesn't
A	I'm pretty sure it does when when it's really it does
C	even feta doesn't melt you you can grill that and it won't melt
A	yeah halloumi doesn't melt
C	halloumi doesn't melt
A	I love halloumi I like I have halloumi pretty much every day
C	mate at
A	be better that what that shit that I got I don't know what it was it was like juts deep fried potato or something it was very bad
C	oh you ordered some sort of like onion like
A	oh is that what it was? yeah oh onion I'm pretty sure I had onion rings
C	yeah but then it was onion strips or something and then it had like
A	no it was just battered
C	yeah and then you were like
A	batter
C	you did like oh mate should have gone for the chilly fries what am I doing with my life?
A	yeah and it was so salty ah
C	you can't eat at
A	well I'm sure they have a vegetarian option don't they?
C	it's going to be shit mate
A	no they they've got like
C	it's gonna be shit
A	I found that with restaurant stuff like they have a whole range of meat stuff and you can pick either one but they might not put as much effort into it but with the vegetarian option you've only got very few so they need to make it right
C	no
A	and they dedicate a lot of time to making it good
C	fuck off they'll just get some frozen burgers and shove it on the grill
A	no they won't
C	yeah they will
A	no they won't
C	yeah they will yeah they will
A	no they won't they make their they make their own patties
C	oh fuck off no they won't
A	they will don't you reckon erm like erm restaurants and stuff because they've only got a very limited amount of vegetarian options they'll put more effort into what they actually are cos you've got loads of meat options they're just like ah yeah we'll have that put that in together but with vegetarian
B	I don't reckon they put any more effort into it
A	I think they do
B	put a patty on the grill
C	fucking hell
A	no they just need to design it cos it's got to be good cos if you're vegetarian it's like you've only got two things that you can have and if and if you get that one thing and you hate it
C	well on the flip side it might be designed well but because they don't cook it very often
A	yeah no
C	might
A	I might try avocado but I I know people do
E	tastes like shit
B	yeah
A	you you've put me off in now

B	pack of Uno cards
C	no you have a double deck you have two decks

B	yeah but you can
A	but an Uno deck is double the size of the normal deck of cards
B	ah right right okay okay
A	you don't have to mix decks but er the only annoying thing about that was that it would never go back in the pack properly cos there were just too many cards it was
B	is that your story?

B	like two lines tops
A	but they stimulate conversation which is er what's needed in this er
E	mm
B	went out today
E	did you?
B	saw a duck
B	that is that is an example of a er
A	but it's not though it's fucking not
C	what the fuck's your story then?
A	I was just saying they just didn't go back right
C	still waiting still waiting
B	I went and saw a duck it's like two lines
A	fuck off
B	there's no end there's no beginning middle end
A	there is the beginning is I had a pack of Uno cards
E	where's that blind come from? oh it's mine
B	that's the card that's the set up
A	you're kidding
B	no it's not a beginning it doesn't go anywhere
