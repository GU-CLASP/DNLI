A	or you can think about what your dream is
B	I'm not sitting here for an hour
C	you don't have to sit here for an hour
A	you can think of what your dream is and er
A	isn't he?
C	well yes
B	no
D	what what what age?
C	dad dad won't let you live here when
D	what age?
C	well when you start earning
A	well as soon as you leave full time education I I I would expect you to pay rent and contribute to the house
B	I'll pay you in lifts instead
A	no
C	oh lifts from the pub excellent
A	well well
C	and your petrol
B	alright
D	you said you weren't paying my petrol
C	well you're fourteen you don't need to worry about who's paying for your petrol
A	you you know if you don't know what you wanna do
C	but how much what do you need to get to get to America? how what does it matter what your rating is?
B	well yeah they're not gonna take a seven point two
C	so what what rating do you need to be at to get there?
B	I dunno basically it has to be low
C	yeah but how low?
B	below a well I'd say a five
C	well yeah are you gonna get below a five in the next year?
B	no it's not gonna happen
D	anyway I'm going for a shower I smell
C	mm thanks
B	I'm going for a shower after so
C	oh
A	the other option is we start you on those LTA courses
C	what LTA courses?
B	coaching courses
A	coaching courses
C	oh as opposed to the LPT ones?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	he saying he's still really angry
C	about what?
B	well he's like I'm the second highest qualified coach now and on the lowest pay
C	has he still not had a rise?
B	he says he's gonna ask once he's sixteen
C	he is sixteen
B	well I dunno yet
C	he was sixteen in March
B	maybe he has had a rise I'll ask him tomorrow we always talk about it
C	mm
A	have you told him you've had a rise then?
B	yeah I told him I had a rise yeah
C	does he wish he'd done the coaching course?
B	he did that's his point
C	no no no sorry not the coaching course
A	the the referee
C	the er tournament organiser course
B	I dunno cos it doesn't two of us to run it
C	mm
A	he doesn't seem to enjoy coaching anyway though does he?
C	no he doesn't
A	is he a good coach when he does coach?
B	yeah well he he knows enough doesn't he because he just relays information that he's been told over the years doesn't he?
C	he's had a lot of information given to him
B	quite he's bright isn't he? so
C	yeah
A	does he do more technical coaching than you do do you think?
B	it's hard to do technical coaching in a group session
C	is that why they don't do it?
B	yeah cos you can't really
C	well why not? why can't they like line everyone up and and make them serve and tell them what they're doing wrong?
B	cos when you're lined up waiting for your someone to serve one by one and there's nine of you in the group you have to wait at least nine minutes
C	I know but well that's what annoys me about
B	that's why they do that's why it's tactical
C	the academy it's not
B	well they can't they physically can't really do it unless unless you put them all just into matches and you go round one by one and pick something out
A	see what I don't understand though is that you you you can do drills in groups can't you?
B	yeah
A	yeah so why can't one person be doing some drills and just the other person take people aside for ten minutes just to say look
A	this isn't quite right I'd really like you to work on this this and this
B	what so?
C	yeah I I yeah
B	no cos you don't do drills for long enough drills last five ten minutes
A	alright well it
C	oh it's just when you're doing hitting at the end why not take one person aside and say okay?
B	cos you don't have time to do everything
C	and and that's that's what
A	but you
B	yeah
A	well in that term if you've got twelve
C	I've had loads of wine
A	if you've
C	I'm gonna not
A	if you've got twelve people in the group why can't they just identify two people each lesson and say right in this lesson we're gonna focus on these two and the rest we're just gonna continue doing generic stuff with but they'll have other stuff that they've been thinking about
B	well I think the big difference is which is what me and
C	mm
B	and you've got your technical part which is the lesson
C	oh
B	so he
C	so you're not getting and
B	yeah
C	is getting one out of the three
B	so
C	okay
B	already which is why it doesn't happen
C	so out of the
B	so
C	people in the academy how many are doing all three?
B	well most of them are doing all three and if they're not doing all three they're averaging at least one a month of a private lesson
C	so it's only you two
B	so he's just doing the tactical
C	oh okay
A	but I I I think that tactical is a load of rubbish I really do
C	yeah I think you'd you you'd benefit from the technical private lesson
A	because
C	over the tactical
A	the
B	I've said that all along but I dunno why you're telling me
C	I know well we I know I know
A	doesn't make any difference telling me
C	we didn't manage to get out of it did we? but
A	but even when you spoke to him we we left it down to you to tell him and he you had a chat with him and he
C	who?
B	what the squad?
A	yeah
B	that's because I I
C	he talked us round
B	in
C	so you can't have a go at him
B	in the squad I
C	he talked us round
B	in the
C	quit is the past tense
B	so
C	of quit
B	there was no reason not to
C	quit
B	and then
C	got it?
B	everyone dropped out so it ended up being a lesson anyway so it was a win win for us and
A	oh so it has been good for you?
B	well I then
C	this has on the Tuesday now when I said to
B	everyone's dropped out apart from him
C	everyone's dropped out which is why he said
B	I am the only one
C	okay I'll transfer the money over to
A	right
C	but what I'm thinking is it's within our it's
A	okay
C	forty pounds a month
A	yeah he is
C	he's got it mentally
B	he's only the best there
C	he wants to win
B	cos he's the fittest
C	he's fittest he's got it mentally
A	but they all say
C	but
C	he's
A	find a way to win
C	and he's the one that they all want to beat
A	so that must be that must be tactical
C	he's the one they want to beat
A	yeah
C	they've all said that haven't they?
A	he's
C	and they're two years
A	he's a lot
C	younger than him

B	yeah definitely
C	tennis is a great sport when you're older to
B	but he's always gonna pick football

A	he wants some
C	bound to eventually because he does every sport going he's good at every sport and they pick him for every sport and he misses shedloads of days because oh I'm doing this I'm doing that for the school

A	I think he's well I think he's
C	you brought him into the team really
A	well
D	no no I didn't play well the first season
C	and he hasn't really
A	pardon?
D	I didn't play well the first season
A	yeah you did
D	apart from when I play
A	no that was the following
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah
A	that was the beginning of the second season when you played them
C	that wasn't last season
A	yeah it was it was the first game virtually the first game of last season
D	oh really?
A	yeah
C	I mean it's all gonna be changed this year isn't it?
A	no
C	obviously we'll miss
A	I can't believe
C	the
A	the league below them but I can't
C	but then on the
A	yeah yeah
C	oh are they? which league
A	they beat them about
D	we played them
A	about six nil last year
D	eight nil
A	eight nil
C	and he wants to go to them?
A	yeah
C	cos he wants to be a big fish in a small pond
A	he does he's not happy with the amount of time he gets subbed
C	but he hasn't been subbed that much this year
A	no I don't think he has I don't think he's been very good do you know what? he bottles every fifty fifty
C	everything yeah
A	ball
C	even I think that and I don't know what
A	I can't believe
D	is he out of his depth?
A	is he out of his depth were there at that point?
C	no
D	no
A	that's a shocking comment to make
C	that's what he said though
A	was
C	er
A	do you ever say anything about it?
D	no
A	who talks about it?
D	I dunno
C	he just must overhear stuff that they think he's not listening to must mustn't he? as manager? bunch of lads like that yeah anyway
A	well it's probably
D	yeah
A	er
C	does he?
D	yeah
C	but yeah that's what he said is it because he's out of his depth he's moving?
A	but the the the players they've got left pretty much the better players
C	that's what
D	that's right
C	he said the the nine that want to definitely stay in the team are the strongest nine
A	the only one that I would would I would argue about is
D	but apparently there is more people wanna come on the team
C	who? but he wouldn't say who the potential new manager was
D	yeah I
A	do you not?
C	why?
D	cos when I asked
C	is
A	yeah
D	and
A	why?
D	well is there much point if we find a manager no if we
A	but is he leaving because he doesn't like you lot do you think cos you take the micky out of him?
D	I don't know I don't think I dunno
A	he's out of his depth
D	people at school take the micky out of him a lot more than we do
C	do they?
A	do they?
C	what in the school team?
D	no just his friends
C	oh
A	what say he's slow and can't run?
D	yeah saying oh yeah it'll take you fifty years to get to that
A	why don't you play central midfield for your school?
D	don't know
A	did you ask to play there or not?
D	no I don't he's never see any player there
C	who hasn't?
A	but next year when the new manager comes in I think you should say you'll play on central midfield cos I think people like
D	yeah
A	is that what he said?
D	yeah
A	I don't know what what
D	yeah
C	oh does he?
A	he does yeah he's always wanted to play there
C	doesn't wanna be in defence?
A	no
C	oh
A	well I'm not sure he's got he's a good player he's hard as nails I'm not sure he's got the energy you've got
D	no
A	and er when you've played him midfield you've actually
D	I don't know what that means
A	you've controlled play you've told people
D	oh
A	where they need to be you've you've organised people much better than you do when you're at centre back next
D	yeah
A	to
D	he likes to say squeeze
C	he likes to what?
D	to say squeeze
C	say squeeze?
D	yeah
C	what does that mean?
D	push up the defence
C	what?
A	when does he say that to you?
D	he always says it
A	do you
D	or he goes on me he's like alright behave
C	on me?
A	is that what you say?
D	yeah he goes on yeah he goes on me
C	what's that mean?
A	do you laugh at him?
D	yeah
A	does he laugh back at you?
D	well sometimes if it's an important situation and the ball's just gone out and then he goes on me like just says on on me
C	what's that mean?
A	it means move up of with me
D	yeah
A	what it's meant to be
C	mm
A	what do you do? do you just laugh at him?
D	yeah
D	ah and there's and then there's

A	thirty-five thirty-six thirty-seven
C	he was young then when he had

D	his wife won't let him but we we all want him to take it on
A	have you told him that?
D	we haven't no I haven't seen him we've told
C	apparently he is well they've got three younger daughters haven't they?
D	yeah they've got twins
C	but his mum doesn't want him to do the football team and I mean you can understand that if she's got three daughters that she's practically
A	mind you
C	on her own with because he
A	is
D	yeah
A	staying?
C	yeah
D	yeah he is
A	isn't he
C	he just
A	like is he one of the nine?

D	yeah but he's
A	I thought
D	oh I dunno I think he might be a little bit
A	but the thing is if they got to know each other they'd probably get on quite well wouldn't they?
D	yeah well they might be jealous of each other though
A	what about
