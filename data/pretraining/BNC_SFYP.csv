A	yeah so I think the interviews will be good practice anyway
B	yeah
A	won't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	ah
A	yeah
B	ah
A	well we need to think of all the things involved in writing
B	there's quite a lot to to think about
A	yeah
B	like well you just don't don't know
A	yeah
B	or or the materials that we've done before
A	yeah
B	that I did with British Council
A	yeah I suppose so
B	all all of that sort of stuff
A	yep
B	that ooh without talking about I'm gonna completely forget
A	okay well that website you were looking at earlier
B	which one?
A	moodle
B	moodle?
A	yeah
B	yeah but I don't really understand Moodle
A	yeah I had a look on their website and it and the videos were shit
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	logged in as the demo and it didn't really show me any
A	no
B	it's just this is how you set up er questions
A	yeah
B	demonstrated on there
A	yeah
B	it it looks pretty new
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure
A	but apparently it's similar to Blackboard
B	mm
A	where you can
B	yeah
A	I don't know put different classes up
B	but it looks
A	and then put in the work that you're doing in the class put it on there for them to do as extra study
B	yeah but do you know how many extra hours that
A	what for the teacher?
B	yeah
A	yeah quite a lot
B	I mean I know it's better for the student
A	yeah God
B	definitely definitely
A	yeah well as
B	but
A	as long as they figure this into the pay scale of these jobs
B	the teacher needs to have some time to do that
A	yeah you need some down time
B	and you need to know the whole system so you can just type inn a question like de de de de de de done
A	yeah
B	Pf like
A	well like at the British Council like Patrick and he had that was his job doing stuff like that
B	yeah
A	so it could almost be the teacher and then these I don't think it's fair expecting people to do both under the same job title
B	well it's alright if you have less teaching hours and then
A	yeah
B	you've got time to put it up but
A	yeah but you know things like this always
B	no
A	get squished into your
B	yeah
A	thing don't they
B	ha
A	it's the same with anything
B	it can definitely be good but I er
A	yeah
B	it's basically putting a putting the lesson up
A	mm
B	write a question here
A	mm
B	so like then for say like you've got a multiple choice question
A	mm
B	and then you like have four you have four multiple-choice answers
A	mm
B	incorrect
A	yeah
B	or some of them
A	and
B	this is incorrect because la la la la la
A	yeah and and it shows as well um like each person
B	oh do they? I didn't see that bit
A	er well not an avatar but a you know just a picture
B	yeah
A	but they're and then you can have like quizzes where you can see
B	ah
A	so you can see which students got what right and what wrong
B	mm
A	but you can also keep it anonymous as well
B	yeah
A	and then you can have like chat rooms for the students which is good as well
B	yeah
A	forums where they can just post questions for anyone
B	yeah
A	so it's yeah I think it's a brilliant thing
B	it well it is
A	yeah
B	be able to just quickly
A	yeah
B	be able to quickly put something up at the end of each class or something
A	yeah yeah
B	any questions that have come up in the class might type it in
A	yeah
B	mm
A	innit
B	yeah this is for this module
A	yeah
B	yeah and you can improve it every time
A	yeah
B	well it's just collecting all the
A	yeah
B	collect it from all the teachers
A	yeah
B	I was thinking they're gonna have a fantastic database afterwards
A	who?
B	well Moodle
A	moodle
B	they'll have a fantastic database of um cos they do all sorts of subjects and all sorts of languages
A	oh yeah yeah
B	of all of this stuff that teachers create for them
A	mm
B	oh I'm
A	that was so
B	yeah
A	drab and
B	yeah
A	it was just I dunno it was horrible wasn't it
B	yeah
A	I don't know how new it is
B	well I think it looks quite new because I don't they haven't really set up the demos or stuff
A	no
B	mm
A	ah
B	they are? Daily Mail?
A	well they just
B	mm mm
A	er let's have a look
B	what did you find?
A	er there was a  there was a guy  who went to a garage sale
B	mm
A	and why don't we have garage sales here?
B	well people have um yard sales don't they? Oh no
A	no they don't
B	no
A	why don't they do it?
B	you can make one but not many people come
A	they don't really do it though do they
B	in the suburbs
A	no
B	mm
A	well maybe
B	well we have jumble sales instead
A	car boots and jumbles
B	yeah
A	but car boots have been shit now for a good ten years
B	it probably er it's probably not allowed or something that you can sell loads of stuff
A	yeah probably
B	outside your house
A	yeah
B	there's all sorts of you know if someone falls over what are you gonna do?
A	but the last ten
A	the last
B	mm they've been rubbish
A	and the car boots I've been to the last few years have all been rubbish
B	yeah we've either been going to the wrong ones or people have
A	because people got  people got  too savvy on
B	mm
A	like collecting stuff and picking up good stuff
B	mm
A	and I remember like when I used to go you still got the collectors going in but not like now
B	no
A	now they just clean up everything in ten minutes
B	yeah
A	like when we went what a few months ago
B	yeah
A	like in the first five minutes
B	mm
A	it's kind of the whole demographic of it has changed I think
B	A little bit yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and jumble sales people aren't getting rid of much stuff anymore
B	well people keep all their gold and silver or they take them to a dealer
A	mm
B	like they're they're not just gonna stick it on their car boot stall anymore they just
A	no
B	unless unless
A	well not with all this stuff I mean you go down the high street
B	yeah
A	people have got wise to it now
B	yeah
A	and it's not like the nineties
B	they look at it
A	mm
B	find out what it is
A	hmm mm
B	I'll take it to a dealer rather than stick it on their car boot sale and sell it for a couple of quid
A	yeah
B	so yeah
A	ha
B	anyway what's this guy who went to the garage sale?
A	oh yeah
B	no way
A	worth a million dollars
B	what? No way
A	but that's
B	that's see er that seems to happen a fair bit though
A	I don't understand it though cos it had you know it was obviously Andy Warhol
B	mm
A	you know the kind of photo reverse it kind of effect
B	mm
A	yeah? Um ha and it had Andy Warhol in big like writing in the bottom corner
B	it's legitimate?
A	to my untrained eye
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	it hasn't?
A	no
B	ah I doubt it's real
A	so I reckon there's a good chance it'll be a fake but
B	yeah
B	well who um who like looked at it and tried to verify it?
A	well I dunno it didn't say that
A	and
B	that'd be so cool if you could buy
A	yeah
B	find something crazy at a car boot that an old lady is trying to get rid of
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	for fifty pence
B	yeah well it's still upstairs
A	yeah that Greek historian guy
B	how much is that?
A	I dunno well it wouldn't be that much
B	mm
A	but it's just nice having like it's a historical document
B	yeah yeah
A	it's beautiful
B	them books
A	well it's been rebound
B	mm
A	but it's still pretty in tact
B	hmm
A	I love stuff like that
B	mm
A	I remember once my dad was cleaning out the attic
A	he was cleaning out the loft and he came down with this big painting of a sunflower
B	I can't remember
A	like all my family was there and he was like look at this
B	oh I remember you saying now yeah
A	and it caught on the hook and just went swhh
B	mm
B	yeah
A	cos of the colours
B	yeah yeah
A	you can tell can't you
B	yeah and the vibrancies
A	and they don't fade do they
A	yeah
B	I bet your does your dad er still remember that?
A	probably
B	do he still think it was a Van Gogh?
A	Don't know
A	he probably tells everyone down the pub it was
B	yeah
A	ha
B	really? I think they were spotted before in
A	no
B	A few years
A	that would be the first one ever apparently
B	oh really?
A	some guys were um bird watching off of Sheringham
B	mm
B	I'm sure they would have seen by the size of it whether it was a killer whale or a dolphin
A	yeah
B	ha
A	yeah they don't really look the same do they?
B	what kind of stories are these you've got?
A	I don't know I just
B	unverified stories
A	I just had a quick look
A	but it's possible cos er I remember in
B	yeah
A	where were we?
B	in Pulau Weh
A	in Pulau Weh
B	mm
A	those guys
B	not that
A	yeah the this killer whale got lost
B	was it? It was a killer whale? mm
A	yeah
B	what and there's one by
A	well no I think they're round the Arctic as well
B	oh
A	it is possible
B	mm
A	I think sometimes they get their navigation systems damaged
B	mm
A	and just go the wrong way or
B	hmm
A	mm
B	we should go go whale watching one day
A	mm
B	you know I
A	have you ever seen one?
B	I've never seen a whale
A	have you not?
B	no
A	did we not see one together?
B	no
A	oh
B	no I don't remember seeing a whale
A	we haven't have we
B	no
A	yeah we have
A	what were they?
B	not bottle-nosed
A	no they were in the Mekong
B	um stubbed-nosed
A	yeah
B	not bottled
A	flat-nosed dolphin or something
B	something like that in the
A	Mekong
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	see
A	I've seen a killer whale in the zoo
B	have you? How have they got a pool big enough to put a killer whale in the zoo?
A	yeah cos they train them don't they to throw them out the water and stuff
B	no that's not a whale
A	wasn't it? Or was that a dolphin?
B	I don't think they have any whales in zoos
A	they do
B	no they don't
A	they do cos then they jump  they jump  out of the water and everyone gets splashed
B	how? But they're too big
A	they do
B	well you can tell I haven't been to a zoo in a long long long long long time
A	yeah cos I remember they had people standing on all the dolphins and the dolphins were like going along and flipping them up
B	what and then a whale popped his head up?
A	well no it wasn't in the same tank
B	but it must have been a massive tank
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	how big is a killer whale?
A	er I don't know
B	am I like thinking of a blue whale? And thinking like whoa
A	they're big but they're not
B	mm
A	ha ha
B	mm
A	mm
B	Coronation Street?
A	Coronation Street
B	oh
A	A fan
B	it's not called Coronation Street anymore
A	isn't it? What's it called?
B	it's called Corrie
A	is it?
B	that was I saw  I saw  the start of it once
A	oh
B	yeah they've changed the whole like start of it and it's called Corrie
A	have they still got the same music?
B	I don't know
A	I think the last time I saw it it was
B	I guess so
A	the beginning went over the rooftops and there was a cat sitting on there
A	on on the roof
B	oh yeah
A	they must
B	yeah it's probably probably the same
A	it's probably got a drum and bass intro now or something
B	no no I think it's the probably the same
A	yeah well they did the same with Emmerdale didn't they
B	what?
A	yeah it used to be called Emmerdale Farm didn't it?
B	no
A	yeah now it's just Emmerdale
A	yeah
B	no it's not
A	I'm not
B	what?
A	in her sleep
B	you're kidding
A	no
B	what country?
A	here
B	what? hmm not region what?
B	what?
B	are you serious?
A	yeah
B	and he did the little kid actually say I copied it off of Coronation Street?
A	well no
B	that weird mentality like where would you get the idea to get a hammer
A	yeah
B	well he must have had that violent tendency first and then
A	well I hope so yeah
B	just got the idea of the hammer
A	yeah
B	otherwise like I dunno he could have picked up anything
A	yeah
B	you'd think kitchen knife or something
A	yeah
B	oh dear
A	that story a few years ago wasn't it that um
B	yeah
A	what are they called?
B	chucky they're called Chucky
A	is that what they're called?
B	no no doll um
A	doll
B	mm
A	and those kids
B	child Play
A	child Play?
B	child's Play
A	yeah that's it yeah
B	mm
A	and those kids said they watched horror movies all the time and that was their favourite
B	yeah
A	was that the Bulger
B	yeah
A	one or was that a different one?
B	that was ages ago
A	it might have been a different one
B	I wonder what happened to those kids
A	I don't know
B	now
A	probably released
B	it's really sad those things
A	mm
B	yeah well I think
A	I think it desensitises people
B	yeah
A	like hugely
B	of cause it does
A	desensitises them to violence and and sex and language and I don't know
B	even hitting people over the head
A	yeah right yeah
B	or punching people once and thinking that
A	well punching them repeatedly
B	they're just gonna bounce back up again
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah in the head
B	yeah
A	yeah go out in the street and do that and and someone doesn't get up again
B	yeah
A	which happens like every weekend
B	yeah
A	yeah er that's pf
B	and they just think that they will just bounce back up again
A	yeah
B	because on all the films
A	yeah
B	because it's it's they
A	mm
B	because it's in so many films
A	mm
B	it's like cluck him over the head
A	yeah
B	he gets back up and they fight some more
A	although although you could say did Tom And Jerry not do that as well? Or is it different?
B	it's different
A	why?
B	it's a cartoon about a cat and a mouse
B	no the
A	reality? So a little doll walking around
B	no
A	so just like the average Hollywood movie
B	yeah the Hollywood movies where they're you know the action movies where the police are getting the gangsters or whatever and everybody's punching each other out
A	mm
B	and they all just keep getting up and getting punched again and again and again
A	mm
B	now that because they're real actors
A	mm
B	and it seems like a possible real situation
A	mm
B	no
A	yeah
B	and so it's not the same as getting up again and
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but then put James Bond on there and he's untouchable
B	mm
A	and it's I dunno yeah it's hmm
B	well I don't know about that Chucky one
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I mean he must have known that
B	no
A	hmm
B	oh how awful
A	yeah
B	it's horrible
A	it's what a  what a  sick country
B	I think I don't remember them complaining about that
A	no that was Coronation Street
B	yeah I know but on the I don't know there was a complaints programme or something
A	right
B	and they were complaining about you know how
A	well that's the thing
B	eastEnders is influencing young people into drinking
A	yeah
B	but they're not talking about Coronation Street influencing people to hit people over the head with a hammer
B	oh did they actually show that on TV?
A	I don't know
B	before the watershed?
A	probably not
B	mm
A	and then there's another one that controls terrestrial TV
B	mm
A	and then there's another one that controls satellite TV
B	is there? I
A	and now everyone's got satellite TV in the home
B	yeah
A	you you can't control it
B	yeah but Coronation Street is on terrestrial TV
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know you can go to those channels of women sitting around with their tits hang out at
B	not
A	not but er my point is in most places you can
B	mm
A	like any time of the day
B	yeah
A	yeah but how many people?
B	you can block them
A	you really think a lot of people do that?
B	yeah if you've got kids of cause you're gonna block all the channels
A	yeah? mm
B	no definitely
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but even you can see in our generation how you know people we know that have got kids now
B	oh yes
A	and the videos
B	oh God
A	like when when we grew up a twelve rated video was a twelve rated video
B	shooting
A	and a fifteen was a fifteen
B	yeah and you weren't allowed to watch it
A	my parents
B	I remember I wasn't allowed
A	yeah once I was fifteen yeah that was pretty much it but but certainly under twelve
B	yeah
A	if there was anything dodgy they'd have to watch it first and then say I could watch it
B	yeah
A	but now you turn on the TV you've got twenty-four hour movie channels
B	mm
A	ha ha
B	that was the film I wanted to see
A	mm
B	and I snuck in round the door and was watching it through the crack in the door
B	and it scared the shit out of me
B	oh my God
B	and that's why I wasn't allowed to watch it see
A	yeah
B	and I'll never forget that film though
B	never forget that film
A	yeah
B	the wolf costumes are really bad
A	yeah well back in the day though
B	really funny wolf costumes
A	yeah I remember er watching Dracula
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	ah
A	Cos we didn't have one
B	ah
A	and they had well my mum and dad had gone out with their mum and dad
B	yeah
A	and she had kids that were a couple of well a few years older than me
B	mm
A	so we were just round there and they thought it'd be funny to put a horror movie on
B	I used to love horror movies though
A	yeah
B	when I used to babysit all I used to watch was horror movies
A	yeah but not when you're eight
B	no not when you're eight
A	yeah I still do
B	oh I've gone off them a bit now
A	I don't like the gore movies
B	yeah psychological thriller type things
A	and I like the old style seventies ones
B	like The Stuff?
A	yeah I like the B movies as well yeah
B	what's a B movie?
A	well B movie like low budget ones
B	the Stuff wasn't low budget in that time
B	all that white gunk they had to buy
B	there's loads of special effects in that
B	yeah
A	what else? We've got Basket Case
B	no
A	where he's got
B	oh yes
A	and he used to have to feed it people
B	it it's coming back
B	yeah
A	yeah that was quite funny
B	that was weird but I can't remember a lot of the story story
A	hmm mm hmm mm
B	ah
A	and then there's David I think it was David Kronemburg did that one um ah I can't remember what it was called
B	oh
A	and it gets inside you
B	that's
A	no but it makes you go crazy like in a sexual way
B	yeah
B	like
B	ah
A	mm
B	I want to email her
A	no
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	ha
A	yeah
B	ha
A	but Lost Highway was on the other night
B	oh
A	it doesn't make
B	I used to have such a good memory of storylines of films but I just seem to have lost it now
A	oh well that one there is it it's a bit of a head fuck
B	mm
A	but I've got my interpretation of it
B	mm yeah
A	I mean it's not pleasurable viewing
A	it's just dark
B	what was mum and dad saying? That was their date wasn't it? Oh no
A	yeah they
B	no
A	yeah he took
B	clockwork Orange
A	clockwork Orange?
B	that was Clockwork Orange yeah yeah
A	yeah let's go for a romantic date
B	ha
A	go and see Clockwork Orange
B	I think they did yeah
A	mm
B	what with your ripped piece of paper?
A	tonight there has been an eviction of
B	ah my fire
A	eviction
B	oh hang on I've gotta get some wood
A	I can't remember what it was
B	eviction of a house?
A	mm
B	I might have got it up too high I don't know
A	is it cos too much air is getting in it?
B	I turned it down but er I don't know really
A	it's just eating those logs
B	mm
A	yeah
B	for the next two days
A	mm
B	two days it's or well tonight no tomorrow and the next day that should last all of that hot water
A	mm
B	if we keep the fire going all night tonight
A	hmm
B	what were you saying about evictions?
A	er oh yeah I think this was in Bristol
B	ooh did they get to keep it?
A	this is a typical Daily Mail story
B	mm
A	trashed this beautiful house
B	how did they manage to find a mansion to go and move into?
A	I don't know
B	no
A	it wasn't like an empty house
B	well they can't stay there too long otherwise they have rights
A	yeah
B	won't they?
A	well yeah
B	or do you?
A	you do
B	you do
A	yeah I don't know how they got kicked out
B	there's so many empty houses
A	yeah but have you seen what they do to them?
B	the squatters?
A	no the council
B	the council? They just let them rot
A	no well first of all they rip out all of them plumbing so they can't use the toilets or any of the taps
B	yeah
A	and the bath
B	what? So that the squatters can't go in there?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	which is why they're called dirty squatters
B	yeah
A	any sane person would use a toilet
B	well cause you would
A	no that's what the council do when they're
B	oh
A	they've got these in
B	mm
A	a lot of the places they even put security guards on them
B	mm
A	and it's
B	that's crazy
A	but I remember there was a programme on TV that this bloke was trying to get all these empty houses used for
B	yeah he's famous now
A	is he?
B	he's on there every day nearly
A	is he?
B	yeah he's on there nearly every day
A	yeah he's I don't know if I like him
B	um
A	he's a bit of a
B	trying to save
A	yeah
B	he's trying to save all the houses
A	I don't know
B	well it doesn't matter for whose benefit if it's for er everybody's benefit in the end
A	yeah
B	no
A	oh right
B	so even if he because he's got a television programme can do up like three houses or
A	mm
B	get people onto those low rent plans or something like that then do it yeah
A	mm
B	if I could not if I wanted to do a TV programme
A	mm
B	wanted to get money through it
A	mm
B	it doesn't matter
A	no
B	better than just doing any old programme when it doesn't help anybody
A	yeah but what I do object to is I mean we've both worked our arses off our whole life
B	well we could get a mortgage if we want
A	Pf
B	well exactly
A	yeah but we can't
B	well yeah it's all about borrowing
A	well yeah but
B	but it always has been
A	yeah
B	to get yourself on the um ladder
A	but not right now
B	yeah I I agree with you
A	like ten years ago to now
B	that's why we're not gonna buy
A	and even equate the inflation then it's it's just ridiculous
B	yeah
A	and it's the thing that annoys me is when people get given all this accommodation
B	who gets given it? Oh what
A	well like really low
B	yeah
A	and then they have ten kids and get a massive house
B	yeah
A	I mean that's
B	well that's always been the case with the if you know how to play the system then you you play it
A	but that's not an argument is it saying that's always been the case
B	no no
A	so therefore it's it's okay
B	mm
A	I mean
B	no I think it's wrong that they all get them
A	mm
B	then
A	but that's the biggest problem in this country
B	the biggest?
A	one of them
B	oh yeah they're all claiming from the system and wanting everything that they can get their hands on
A	yeah they're not striving
B	yeah
A	I mean if they were forced
B	oh yeah
A	and people are born with this mentality where they don't need any of that
B	yeah
A	they don't need to strive
B	they just want everything given to them on a plate
A	yeah which is why we've got all these foreign workers coming in who are striving because that's their work ethic
B	mm mm
A	I mean we know because we've seen them
B	oh yeah
A	like working like mm where they live
B	but you can't say that of everybody who's like in the country but
A	oh no of course not and
B	yeah
A	and that mentality
B	mm
A	it's gonna have to be
B	it's gonna be painful for us if we stay in England
A	mm
B	I know
A	anyway
B	anyway er tell me  tell me  what you were saying
A	the what?
B	the Mail
A	mail language?
B	um
A	oh The Daily Mail
B	you said this is typical language for The Mail
A	oh no they always take issues like this and
B	and this is
A	you know they take a very right wing kind of approach
B	what they whinge about it from an upper middle class?
A	well they sensationalise it
B	er no cos that's
A	you know and it's it's the paper my nan buys
B	which one?
A	the Mail
B	no which nan?
A	er in Ashford
B	oh okay
A	so think of her opinions
A	and that kind of reflects the newspaper actually
A	it has had quite a big effect on people newspapers
B	oh yeah
A	it's their only source of news for a lot of people
B	yeah
A	that's their whole world view
B	yeah
A	comes from the newspaper owned by a blimmin' demon
B	A demon?
A	like yeah
B	alone?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	which I remember being left home alone when I was seven
B	yeah but not with a three year old
A	no
B	in the house
A	no but apparently they
B	what?
A	which is why she got in trouble cos the neighbours reported them
B	right
A	but I don't know what I find
B	they probably just rolled in the mud in the garden
A	yeah
B	it's probably what they did
A	this is what I mean by The Daily Mail yeah this is the actual language
B	yeah but they had er
A	covered in faeces
B	ah
A	Cos that's the image they've just painted
B	yeah
A	but they probably just had a bit of dirt on them
B	it has to
A	well no cos it's I mean what faeces
B	yeah
B	maybe they were
A	I don't know
A	maybe they were trying to change the nappy
B	no three year olds don't wear nappies
A	er I've seen a three year old in a nappy
B	three year olds don't need to wear nappies
A	I saw a three year old
B	or maybe they did maybe they wear them at night
A	I got robbed by a three year old in a nappy
B	what?
A	I was in Moss Side and Robin
B	I don't remember this story
A	yeah
B	yeah go on
A	he had a flat in erm he was at university
B	yeah
A	he had a flat in Moss Side which is you know quite notorious
B	yeah
A	and we were just sitting around one day on the ground floor in the living room
B	oh my God
A	waddling along and all of the
B	oh okay
A	come on
A	run
B	oh my God
A	yeah
B	so this
A	Moss Side
B	mm
A	I think it's where Shameless is set as well
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	did he just take one ornament?
A	yeah
A	we got it back
B	teaching them young
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	mm
B	ah
A	mm
B	whatever they get up to
A	mm
B	whatever trouble they get into and stuff
A	mm
B	God
A	yeah well they were
B	I can't imagine
A	yeah they were proper like street kids really
B	yeah
A	it's terrible
B	yeah
A	they looked wild
B	hmm
A	I was quite intimidated by that three year old in a nappy
B	I thought you were gonna say
A	no?
B	no
A	mm
B	I had this image though before you said er this little three year old was like had some sort of weapon
B	some sort of stick or something
A	mm
B	oh you can't believe it can you
A	hmm?
B	boggles my mind
A	well I was
B	I'm sure like lots of them are alright
A	yeah they were all sound
B	oh I know
A	it's just you do get a few complete nutters
B	just if I like if we moved into one of those I think I'd be quite scared
A	yeah
B	of like walking and cos I used to get really intimidated by gangs of people
A	yeah
B	gangs of teenagers and stuff
A	yeah
B	I don't know why
A	mm
B	just the feeling of feeling intimidated by groups of kids hanging out
A	mm
B	you know? Most of them are only hanging out
A	mm
B	they've got nowhere else to go and they sit on the street corner and like
A	mm
B	they might shout a few things or something but
A	but
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	but I like when we were  when we were  travelling and stuff I used to always say that oh the kids the teenagers or the kids um aren't so intimidating in other places
A	yeah
B	but it's just the same
A	bo it's different though
B	mm
A	it is different
B	sometimes you can feel their eyes burning into you or something
A	yeah but in a different way
B	oh
A	do you mean here or there?
B	no here
A	here yeah
B	Cos
A	yeah
B	is here
A	this is the most dangerous country we've ever been
B	I think it's cos we've had so many
A	well you've been to America so
A	maybe maybe not then
B	yeah I was intimidated there too
A	yeah
B	but
A	but I think countries with an aggressive foreign policy are often
B	mm
A	culture
B	yeah
A	Cos I think it just filters down
B	mm
A	well
B	what just like that?
A	yeah
B	it's my lovely fire that did that
B	we'll have to put it in the other room
A	yeah
B	no
A	you know you get your
B	yeah
A	but that's that's not from the heart
B	yeah yeah stuff that they're not supposed to say
A	yeah that was a bad er
B	yeah
A	mm
B	if they did anything wrong
A	well yeah
B	oi you get back in your house
A	yeah right
B	what are you doing? I'm gonna tell your mother
B	you remember that kid?
A	yeah
B	yeah that was brilliant
A	yeah
B	in Tunisia when
A	yeah
B	he
A	yeah well that was nasty cos he was a neighbour
B	yeah
A	little bastard
B	I don't
A	no he called me a monkey man
B	did he? No and then  and then  he
A	and then something else yeah
B	he said  he said  something quite bad I think cos
A	yeah
B	I went I'm gonna tell
A	you did say it in French yeah
B	wow
A	I'm going to tell your mother
B	where's
A	oh okay
B	I just think I said where's your mum
A	oh Okay
B	I'm no I I will talk to your mum
B	probably you know really really like robotic French
A	well it worked didn't it
B	so he legged it
A	yeah
B	yeah well that's what you need
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	whereas kids here
B	yeah they do yeah
A	I mean look at
B	she is fifteen
A	oh she is fifteen
B	she's sixteen next month
A	yeah exactly
B	well she's been through a lot
A	it's
B	just think like because there's so many more um there's a lot more break ups of families
A	nah
B	aggressions in families
A	no
B	Don't you think?
A	no
B	I think there is
A	no
B	no?
A	no
B	mm
A	but I do think like kids are getting a shorter time to be kid
B	but why?
A	they're getting so much pressure
B	they don't work any more
A	to develop sexually more than anything
B	yeah but like you know I had I started
A	yeah but that's different
B	no cos they can't do that any more
A	no
B	they can't even get jobs any more
A	no
B	well they find it harder I think
A	but they
B	mm
A	I mean look at um um going back
B	yeah
A	but do you remember S-Clubs Juniors or something?
B	S-Club Seven
A	no the the little ones
B	okay
A	they were about I don't know ten
B	oh
A	and they were all tarted up in short skirts and makeup
B	yeah the
A	doing this sexy dancing and all that
B	mm
A	and that kind of stuff filters down and gets exaggerated over time
B	mm
A	you know what I mean? And that's that's what these kids are
B	mm
A	I mean when I grew up my kids my my role models were do you know what I mean cartoon characters or
B	yeah but
A	football players or
B	you know
A	but now
B	all
A	look at this pop idol and all that stuff you know
B	I'm saying it's been a long long a good many many many years that girls have hitched their skirts up at school
A	yeah
B	that girls have I don't know started experimenting when they're very young
A	yeah
B	I mean I had kids in my high school that got pregnant
A	mm
B	and I think we look at kids as being
A	yeah
B	but actually I don't think it's that different
A	yeah or that
B	you get older
A	yeah that's a sign of getting old
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Tom I I remember getting tarted up on a night out you know little mini skirt
A	mm
B	so
A	but you didn't have it shoved down your throat every time the TV was on
B	no
A	yeah
B	whereas they do now
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and how you've gotta portray yourself to other people and
B	but why
A	well because they're more conscious about their image
B	and make them more aggressive?
A	and they they have to create this identity for themselves
B	mm
A	and what? What is a popular identity? Then they get that idea from things they see on TV
B	mm
A	popular culture
B	mm
A	and it's been as far as I can see has been targeted towards like younger and younger people
B	yeah
A	just the marketing of it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	of kids
A	mm
B	like that's not like a typical role model thing is it? Like some aggressive kid
A	what about it?
B	and there was a boy on there
A	well he got kicked off that show for taking drugs or something didn't he?
B	he
A	I think so cos
B	and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but he was young
B	yeah he looked very young
A	he wasn't like I mean who else has there been? I mean there's been plenty of drug abuse people being kicked out
B	yeah
A	that bloke from Blue Peter
B	what bloke from? Andy Peters?
A	no
B	that's that's the only one I know
A	can you imagine Andy Peters doing a line of coke
B	no
A	that one that went to The Big Breakfast
B	eh?
A	in fact I think he went to The Big Breakfast
B	Chris?
A	no
B	no idea
A	oh well
B	I have heard
A	it was quite a while ago
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	yeah but now maybe you're right cos now you'd probably wouldn't bother being kicked off nowadays
B	it would just be like oh yeah
B	would he?
A	yeah he would
B	they're probably all in the back in the changing room all doing it together
B	come on everybody
