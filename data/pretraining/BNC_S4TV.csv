B	oh yeah
A	extra thing for the bright people who he's
D	did you get that letter?
C	I'm not in his set
D	oh
B	oh cos he's
A	apparently
B	been moved in science haven't you?
A	apparently he had one for maths
B	do you know why I've never been moved down a set? oh sorry
C	oh oh
A	hang on

D	oh there
A	we only took eight
D	no no no no
C	told you nine
A	I got an extra one in the sixth form
A	anyway back to my point
A	apparently he'd been invited to some sort of maths
C	yeah he isn't even smart enough mum
A	well you're good at maths you're
C	yeah I'm better than
A	so how come you didn't get invited?
C	cos he's the teacher's pet he's his
A	oh
B	you're not
D	so
C	no
A	so it doesn't matter
B	on
C	well I don't sit that awkwardly like
B	oh about maths really?
D	oh really?
C	I'm gonna talk to him
B	really?
C	and explain how to do the question
D	how many times do you get questions about maths from your friends?
D	at least just
B	and not and not for your it's fantasy football league or
B	football
D	so
C	yeah
D	are you?
C	you heard when miss said
B	what?
C	how I always put my hand up always contribute to the group
B	is that because?
D	she didn't say positively
B	is that because your mouth's never shut?
C	maybe it's not
B	is that because your mouth's never shut in lessons
A	no but actually going back to my serious question you you do get very good maths results so why weren't you invited to that?
C	I dunno cos they didn't ask me to do
D	why why are you getting all stressed?
C	cos he's not even smart
B	why are you
A	I think he is
D	I think he's smart
C	not smart enough
B	I guarantee you he is
C	I think he er I think he got a few questions wrong in the test today cos he didn't put
D	but you don't know how many you got right do you?
C	well no we marked half of it and I got all er all of the questions right and then
D	so you're basing that you got every question
B	yeah but
D	that's like saying
C	no I don't I I was confident about every single question
D	you were confident in the spelling test
A	good
C	no I wasn't
A	no he wasn't
D	or you told us one of those
B	you can be confident when you got and play
C	I was gonna bet you that I'll get full marks right?
A	I
A	that I'll beat
D	I'm gonna beat
C	yeah
C	I do
A	I I think you did get full marks in the maths test
B	ah
A	which
C	no I'll no we've only marked
C	we've only we've no we've only marked half of it
A	oh well you're backtracking now
C	no I've always said that but I've got full marks in the half that we'd done and I was
A	and I believe you cos you're good at maths but I can't understand is why you wouldn't get invited to the maths whatever it is
C	neither
D	yes does she not like you?
C	no comment
B	do you talk too much?
C	no comment
B	no comment?
D	you do

B	I bet you he would as well
A	he he'd look hard if he went on report?
B	no he wouldn't he'd look like an idiot
B	but I bet you'd get threes in some
A	what what are threes? what do you mean?

A	do you get marked every day?
C	every lesson
B	er every lesson
A	every lesson?
D	I think we should ask for that
A	mm I don't
B	why?
B	he gets detentions if gets threes
B	and he'd end up with quite a few I think
A	says the boy that had detention this week
D	did you have a detention this week

A	can't he? why?
D	he just can't
D	I just get him sometimes to warm up with the B team at the net
A	why?
D	because I like to try and hit it so that it's dipping underneath the net but really in the warm up they should all be at that height shouldn't they? so that they can easily volley it back and you've got
A	so we need to sort out how you're going to pay
B	he loves

B	we should have invested
A	in what?
C	yeah I told you it was one to one to ten so if you betted
A	invested in what?
C	ten pounds you get a hundred pound back
B	we should have er banked on us leaving and invested
A	it was a close thing
B	in the
A	it was really close you couldn't have really called it
D	mum was sad cos the prime minister resigned today
C	yeah it's cos of mum's
A	well I quite like David Cameron
C	yeah but we're gonna have Boris Boris Johnson

C	no yeah but he's part of
A	he actually quite intelligent and his family are
B	the public don't get the choice
A	are really really highly qualified
D	yeah but he's just a bit of a buffoon
A	he is a buffoon but that's
C	yeah but
A	part of his erm
B	the public don't get the choice
A	no
C	no cos
B	if he gets elected
C	exactly
A	no they choose in the party
D	well the
B	and the main reason
D	you know you're not gonna you're not gonna elect an idiot because if you elect an idiot to
B	he can't be that much of an idiot if he's
D	no I don't mean I don't mean an idiot in he he's an intelligent chap but he's a
A	he is a buffoon but
D	he comes across really badly and he would alienate the working classes of this country
A	I think well yeah he would but quite a few people like him
C	it's Farage I don't like
D	no he's
A	no I don't either he's
D	he's a he's a the most
A	he's a
D	he's a
A	he's a dangerous man
D	he's a dangerous man actually
A	cos of his
B	who's Farage?
B	he is is he in potential?
C	yeah he's
D	no
A	he no but he was voting er leave and he's very jubilant and he's like a really racist extremist keep everyone out
D	the problem with him is erm
C	so he just wants to make us North Korea?
D	that there there were some people today who were talking about okay so that that Labour MP that was Birmingham I think she was the one that was on the debate er
A	I thought she was Scottish
D	no the
A	oh the TUC lady?
D	the lady that we said came across really well
A	oh what the foreign lady?
D	yes the she was South African I think
A	Gisela? I thought
D	yeah
A	she was German
D	no I think she was South African
A	oh
D	erm but she er this lady she was talking about she had a bit of substance behind her as to okay now's the time for stability we we've made a decision we need to know how we are going to deliver the exit and all the rest of it and so was that Scottish lady
A	yes she was
D	who who
A	she was
D	was on the she was in the remain camp and and she was saying that you know and people asked her erm should Scotland have their referendum? and she was saying well actually there
A	did did you have business studies today?
B	no we
A	oh
B	so if England leave the EU or the UK?
A	the UK left it but most of Scotland
D	and Ireland
A	and Ireland Northern Ireland voted to stay in it so they showed a map on the TV this morning and it showed who had done what so
B	mm
A	the map was blue and orange yellow I think
D	yellow
A	yellow so the yellow were the people that voted remain and blue were leave and yellow were Scotland Northern Ireland and London
D	and it was just tiny areas
A	and the rest of the country was blue
D	the whole whole of the
A	but obviously London's huge the population there
D	it's got a huge population
A	so Scotland Northern Ireland and London voted to stay the rest of the country wanted to leave and the people in cos I didn't understand why but the people in London
D	yeah you
A	to other
B	doesn't a lot so much trade go through London
A	yeah yeah
B	because we're in the middle? so in the morning we're awake for like America and then in the evening we're awake for like Spain and Japan and that side?
D	yeah but so is Brussels not Spain erm China
A	China and Japan
D	yeah
C	I thought we didn't trade with China
D	we can trade with China
C	no but like we couldn't before
B	we can trade with anyone
C	because of the EU and stuff because we had to trade
D	er
A	no well
D	well we could trade with them
A	we can
D	there there were just taxes that were imposed the idea is it's quite interesting really cos the the that was part of the economic discussion that if we leave the EU we will
C	yeah
D	erm however there's big opportunities with America Canada New Zealand Australia
C	China
D	and China er that
A	it'll be interesting to see if they discuss it a lot in your business studies syllabus
D	all the teacher said they voted remain apparently
A	did they?
B	yes yeah
C	I erm
A	it would be interesting if it features on like the A level paper
B	Miss
D	cos it affects you guys more than it affects us?
B	yes she said and she reckoned
A	what what does she teach?
B	er sociology and geography
D	well if they had have
B	we would have stayed in wouldn't we?
D	probably
A	yeah
D	probably cos they they think that the younger vote
B	the whole of the youth apparently
D	and there
C	oh yeah the younger
D	on the older market er er
C	yeah
D	older age groups and realistically it should be the younger age groups should have heavier bias on their vote because
C	oh yeah
D	it's more likely to affect them
A	yes but where do you do that cut off? I mean we're only in our forties we voted out but you know I've probably got another fifty years ahead of me yes maybe people in their eighties maybe I don't know where do you?
C	do you two always vote the same?
A	no where do you do that cut off?
C	no
A	where do you do that cut off though with age?
C	mum's
D	we generally do these days
A	er these days we do yeah
C	erm all I know
D	your mother was pretty much when we first met
C	what do you mean?
D	she voted what her parents voted what her father voted
A	I yeah I did voted Labour
D	whereas nanny voted erm
C	don't tell me she
A	Lib Dem
A	she did
B	nanny voted Ukip
A	no
D	she probably does now
C	why what's wrong with Lib Dem?
A	oh they don't do much
D	erm sorry what was that?
A	what's wrong with Lib Dem?
D	Lib Dem? it they're just wishy-washy
A	mm
C	erm all that I've learnt is that our bins might not be cleaned every two weeks
D	who said that?
C	Mr
D	that's
D	such a load of old tosh
D	is that what he based his vote on?
A	what? what?
C	no I think he voted to stay in
A	what's the?
D	why? because his bins wouldn't be cleaned every two weeks
C	well no cos he yeah
C	it could get changed for a week well cos cos apparently England have that vote now so like well England have the control to do that
D	what?
C	cos that was part of the EU the EU made sure that people got their bins cleaned every two weeks I searched it up
A	we get ours emptied every two weeks
C	yeah exactly cos that was cos we were in the EU
A	yeah well before we used to get them emptied every week
C	exactly er
D	but we were in the EU then
C	no no I don't believe it
A	I have no idea what this argument is about
C	I don't believe it
A	I have no idea
D	I think Mr
A	yeah I think so
A	who's Toni Kroos?
B	a German player
A	oh
D	don't you do you think we'll be kicked out of the Euros?
A	no

B	yeah
A	like he's done well he's done really well
D	do you think he'll make do you reckon he'll make
C	yeah
C	well the thing can er do you know when you just hit

A	who's
B	this guy that made the academy
A	oh he's not a footballer?
D	no but every apparently what
A	mm
D	he's got the contacts but my view is if you're good enough
A	you'd have been scouted
D	you'll get scouted or you'll go to a trial and somebody will pick you up at a trial so
C	I never perform well in trials

D	you get you you you get to do everything
B	just play on one side of the centre back as well
A	oh that's really really mean
A	yeah but that's really mean
C	yeah but you should go the other side
B	no he doesn't take it to heart at all like he
D	did you tell him he smelt too?
B	no not no sometimes
A	ah

A	he had quite a few though and they're
B	yeah he's he's been having
A	like with

B	yeah
A	they're better
D	but he didn't do
A	but he needed people
D	I was watching
A	to feed yeah
D	in that squad and he did very little coaching
B	it's a tactical base session
A	what does that mean?
B	it's not based on your technique the session isn't that's part of the academy that's what you two don't get about that squad it's not meant to have any technical work in it if you want the technical work
D	but when
C	you have the private lesson which is the technical
D	which is what you boys don't get
B	if you want the tactical you have the squad if you want the physical you have the Wednesday squad that's what it's split up into
D	so
B	that's why it's called an adademy
D	well do we pull
B	play
A	play tournaments he wants to do indoors

D	twelve pints
D	he'd be in all sorts of trouble wouldn't he?
D	mind you
C	why do you reckon he could?
B	I think once you've had twelve pints then who's gonna win?
D	I think I'd be in a better state than
B	what cos you're bigger?
A	cos he's twice the size
D	the only problem is to win the set you've gotta win four oh yeah quite a lot
B	well you'll have to go to a third fourth set
B	you'll be on fifteen pints
B	one of you'll end up in hospital
D	if he won a game so if I he he'd he
B	well no cos then you'd
D	er no
A	yes
C	forget that
A	you'd have lost the match
B	I could let him win six love six
A	six love six love mm
C	oh
B	you mean six love five love dad and then
D	he'd be
B	with a comeback
B	after eleven pints
D	and then I'd have to drink twelve on the trot
B	thirteen

D	probably about that so
B	yeah
A	mm that's nice actually
B	we've told
D	no he will
A	oh yeah that is absolutely the
A	only way to do it
D	but what what would you game plan be against me and
B	we won't have a game
A	will be to play on dad but will it?
D	but I want you to play er me
B	we won't we won't have a game plan we don't really go onto court in doubles and have a game
B	well his game plan yesterday was a bit harsh
A	what was it?
C	on every return I'm gonna go down the line
A	well good for him I agree with him he's in it to win it
D	yeah he's he's right he was right
A	he's in it to win it
D	so what do you think he would say against me and
B	I dunno he probably wouldn't say a lot
D	what that's because we're your brother and father?
B	I dunno
C	no it's cos I've
B	he doesn't say a lot to me anyway
C	I'd say I was better than him at doubles
B	he wouldn't be happy if we started losing to you
D	sorry?
B	he wouldn't be happy if we started losing to you
D	why? cos he thinks
B	he thinks we should beat you
D	so he's planned his route to the final hasn't he?
B	well well we should get to the final if we beat
C	erm no
B	shouldn't we?
C	no
B	let's be completely honest here
A	will it be
C	you're joking
A	in the final on the other side again?
B	yeah
D	do you not think you'll have a game against me and
B	no you probably will give us a game but I don't think you're gonna beat us
B	yeah but
A	yeah but what?
B	we may as well have been playing left handed
D	so you don't think
B	yeah
A	I think
D	did we not beat them six love or something?
A	I think you'd beat them
C	something like that
B	when we were in the same
C	yeah but it's it's not six love is it? they got a game
A	was that last year you played them?
D	let's not trash talk them too much
D	I don't really wanna have this conversation in two months'
D	and for us to have been wiped off the court
A	you've gotta beat
D	we have got to beat
A	which er I think you should
D	and we should beat them shouldn't we?
B	and we've gotta beat
A	oh that's a tough one
B	if there's one pair that
A	it's you and
B	it will be me and er me and
A	yes
D	I think you could beat them
A	if you don't play on
B	I don't know it's
A	at all
A	no I know but he's not as
D	it doesn't matter
A	he's not in the same league as
B	no
A	so
D	can he put the ball away? cos the
D	the problem they had last last night was the other guy was alright but
B	it
A	the problem with
B	that leaves him that's how well that's what'll happen
A	the problem is he can get to everything and he can intercept if he wants can't he?
D	well yeah but you can lob him cos he's got no legs
B	he will retrieve
A	he's really quick
D	yeah he can retrieve it but then he's not at the net
A	but he would be he's very quick
A	you've just gotta try and not no you can't hit
D	pardon?
B	we we're not gonna hit one ball to him like we we're gonna wind him up as much as we can in that
D	absolutely so you should
A	mm it's the only way to do it
B	if even the guy's at the net we're gonna make it very clear that
D	and er if I was you and
A	yeah
D	I would hit the ball full blooded at his partner
D	absolutely
C	do what no
D	mm he won't do that with you he won't do that with you
A	why not?
D	no
A	cos he's losing
D	cos he no he has a responsibility
A	well
D	for for them and I don't think I don't as much as he wants to win
B	he's not stupid
D	he's not gonna hit them
A	oh hit the ball at them? is that what you?
D	yeah
A	oh no I don't think oh
B	he did it yesterday
D	he doesn't do it to
A	not on
D	he doesn't coach them
A	not I don't think he'd hit no I don't think he'd hit you on purpose
D	he wouldn't hit you
A	no
D	and he wouldn't hit you and I don't think he's hit
D	no
A	we're hoping he wouldn't hit you dad
A	tomorrow
D	well if he did
D	if he did
A	if it
D	I might go round the other side of the court
D	with my racquet
A	I think if he hit you he'd be like
D	and then he won't be playing in the doubles
A	he'd be desperate
D	and he won't be yes
A	if he had to start
D	absolutely
A	he'd be desperate
B	he does
A	does he?
B	when he serves if he starts doing that I mean as I say we'll get
C	well I'm sorry but I've just had to play twenty shots in a row and I was getting a bit
B	quite a lot of the juniors have started to grunt
A	really? do you think you should stop them?
B	he does when he's
A	no
B	trying that's when you know if he's trying or not
A	were you conscious of it? were you conscious of grunting?
B	no they're not
C	dunno
B	obviously not
A	no I'm asking
D	he doesn't grunt
A	wait
D	he went er a couple of times
A	once or twice er like towards the end of the match were you just getting tired?
C	getting a bit
B	I I my shoulder hurts
D	I have to say
D	your mum jumped to your defence
A	I did I said well he's met his match in
C	I was tired before the match started
A	didn't look it though even
D	I said that
A	you didn't look worn out
C	I was sweating
B	yeah but that's er that's yeah
D	the problem you'd the problem you'd have is
C	yeah but the thing is I could hit at pace as well though I've just chosen not to
D	I understand that
D	he can't er I I think both those types of players pose different problems for you at the moment so
B	I reckon I've got that in my
C	and dad told me the wrong game plan
D	I didn't tell you the wrong plan I talked to
B	I mean
D	will be a lot more difficult for you
D	because you won't have you won't have the time to play those
B	but that's mental that's not actually technical like you can listen to every parent like
C	when I can beat you?
B	yeah and eventually the day you come to it it'll be like oh a called that like yeah
A	yeah no you're right he's two years ahead of you age wise experience playing
D	I actually think and and this is being absolutely honest I think you've got great forehand I
C	oh yeah I've got a quick reaction to it
D	you're better on the half volley
C	he's better on
D	he he's better at the net but I think
C	yeah but everyone says
A	do you think?
C	everyone said before
C	he he improved so much and then
A	you have improved
C	yeah I know
A	you have improved
C	I'm just saying I'm
D	don't give it that
C	I'm just saying that he
D	don't give it that
C	I I'm just saying
A	the thing is
D	if everyone everyone stood on the side of the court today telling
C	that's was what
D	that's a load of rubbish
A	it is rubbish
D	it it's a load of er you if you wanna be
A	they just say that to wind you up and to
D	if you wanna beat
B	most of the time I think
C	but oh it's alright
D	he does and he's got over the
A	but what
D	mental problems he had
A	what I wanna know is
D	when he was younger
B	I think
A	how's it gonna go when we feel like you're ready to you know ditch
B	dunno
A	because you know you're just
B	it's not gonna happen very often is it?
D	what do you mean?
A	no but could you not see those?
B	it's only gonna happen like
A	could you not
B	in the tournament
A	see the name er your that's exactly right up on the board?
B	do you know I said
B	you could go places
B	that's what he was saying to me as we were losing the second set
A	how would it go though if you and your brother?
B	he's gonna go to uni
D	he is gonna go to uni
A	oh so then
B	so that's probably gonna happen isn't it? so
A	so you and
A	and you two
B	in two years
A	winners
B	it'll be when he goes university
C	but everyone thinks you know when won it this year everyone's gonna think it's
D	that's fine by me
A	that's why he's gonna play
B	yeah
A	and
D	I want you to play together but I don't want you to get upset with him
A	and it would be
D	because I know if you have a go at him on the tennis court it doesn't work
A	the other thing is though it would be a shame
D	if I ever have a go at you
A	it would be a shame to not play with
C	not on not on the court
A	haven't you?
B	yeah well
A	for like years
D	during the match have I ever had a go?
A	haven't you? that would be a big decision because
D	yeah I know they have
A	that would be a big decision to not play with
D	but also you've gotta
A	I know I know that's why I'm saying it's a big decision because
D	yeah but nobody would play them together
A	what do you mean?
D	they
A	yeah because they were little
D	mm er
A	but they would now wouldn't they?
D	they do sometimes
A	now they've proved themselves
D	they don't rate
A	don't they?
D	no
B	some of them are starting to cos he is insane at the net
D	he is
A	and he's very quick
D	his serve is appalling
B	I know but that's what
A	that's the only thing
B	oh you it some of the pickups you have to make off your serve is
D	because of
B	pickups off the return of his serve
D	who were saying to
B	yeah cos he he yeah he serves
D	yeah
B	very weak but he does make quite a few of them even though it does put us on the back foot
D	but against it's it's okay
A	mm
D	against
D	they'll just rip his serve apart don't they?
B	yeah
A	whereas you will rise above that because
D	thing is you're gonna grow
A	you're a better server you
D	and you're gonna grow you're you will be six foot plus
B	you're gonna be like
D	you're gonna be
A	again
C	I don't wanna be that tall though
A	how tall do you wanna be?
D	I never wanted to be tall either
A	didn't you?
D	no
C	six foot one
A	why?
D	that's my height
C	six
A	why don't you wanna be taller?
C	don't' know
A	why not?
C	I wanna be average height
D	cos you stick out
C	yeah
A	tall men are more successful in business it's been proven
D	doesn't mean anything when you're growing up
D	and you're being a sportsman does it?
A	yeah but it's an advantage in tennis isn't it to be tall?
D	yeah a massive advantage cos it means that
B	not in everything
D	when when you're serving that there's a lot more of the serve that's
B	aspect
A	pardon?
B	not in every aspect like
A	yeah much bigger
B	a lot taller
D	well no that's to do with them being better players that's not just about physically
B	I think physical plays a massive part in tennis
D	it is but it also incredibly mental
A	I think it's nice to be tall
B	if you look at like
D	what are you saying
B	yeah he took his top of er at
D	oh okay sorry
A	he's only little
D	but he's not tall he's not tall
A	he's only small but he's
B	no but
A	muscular
B	muscular endurance
D	well yeah
D	you look at your brother though and in terms of those aspects he's got a lot of endurance
B	yeah and that's why he's better than like
A	yeah
B	cos
D	no what
B	yeah he is good like
D	well no he's tall he's thin
A	he's changed his shape
D	yeah completely
A	I didn't know it was him your dad had to say no that is him I said wow he has changed shape completely
B	he did a nice forehand regardless though
D	is he?
B	yeah
A	he's grown up and gone in and his whole body shape has changed
B	good
D	so do you think do you think the only issue with your brother in terms of the juniors is the amount of balls
B	yeah and
A	yeah he does
B	he plays like every day as well he just doesn't play at the intensity
D	he does he does have a different mm he does have a
B	yeah
A	do you?
C	who
D	who
D	he did actually
A	before you went off
C	yeah he yeah cos I went to go and see him before er cos he had a rain break
A	against
B	yes
B	the score against
A	and what was it?
C	two nil
A	in the second
C	first set yeah
A	oh first set
B	and then they literally finished as we finished the warm they were one nil and we started scored and we as we finished the warmup within the first fifteen minutes they were done
D	but if they're do you know what I I?
A	they only they're only allowed forty-five minutes for that game because
D	I do like
B	he he's he is he is friendly as in he's started to say hello to everyone he sees
D	he's really tried on on the in terms of being interpersonal his personality
A	oh definitely he chats to me
B	he's really he's really trying to talk everyone
A	chats to me and waves to me
D	I
B	whenever whenever you see him he says hello
A	yeah he does
B	like yeah
A	he came up to ask how how
B	he has been trying
A	yeah he's
B	really hard
A	yeah
B	to be liked loved at the club
D	I like him
B	yeah
C	yeah he he we we had a message the other day he's on Instagram we always talk on Instagram now
A	from who?
C	because after our match at
A	he loves
C	I was like oh cheers mate and you you had a quality game
D	the the issue you're gonna have he is gonna overtake you though cos he plays too
A	he will win he will beat you and you will be gutted
B	yeah the day he does beat you it will be an emotional day for you
A	it's like the same day you beat
A	but that might
A	that might just be a one-off
B	the
D	yeah
A	you haven't had
D	yeah
A	an opponent like he has had growing up
C	oh yeah everyone thought he was better than you
A	yeah they did but it was mental
A	that I think they rate
D	yeah they do
B	dunno now I've lost to
D	no you haven't
A	no you haven't not to him no way and he's talking highly of you
D	I don't I don't think you realise how good
A	and he is really and he is now
B	he's a moody git
A	yeah he wants to play you again
D	I can't stand him can't stand him
A	but you
D	I think in a way if you had you'd have probably taken tennis a lot more seriously up to now than you have done
A	but now you've got
D	cos it's not
A	but
C	yeah but then I beat him
A	yes I know you beat him but the fact that he took a set off you
A	to him you've missed the point
A	was his that was his like
D	do you think it matter if you don't if he doesn't win a game off you that's a bad day if he wins
B	a set
D	a set he's made up
A	he's made up he was happy
D	that's like
A	he was ecstatic
B	it's like when you
A	that had made his weekend
B	if you played
A	you'd be on cloud nine if you took a set off
D	he's there to be had hit at and that's what you are against him
A	for for
D	for
D	cos you have a different world from the rest of er everyone
B	cannot be beaten
B	you are invincible
D	which is why it's such a shock for you when it does happen
C	oh yeah
B	when I was playing at
C	did he look good?
B	yes
C	yeah
A	is playing Road to Wimbledon this year?
C	no no
B	dunno but
B	will I see them both? I was like yeah you probably will see them both quite soon
A	really? he knew them by name?
B	well he's tried to poach
D	yeah he has tried to tried to
B	thing about him and when
D	I don't think he tried to poach but I think
B	he probably was but erm
C	yeah but you wouldn't travel to
A	no
B	they didn't like each other on the court they were trying to hit each other
A	no you said that
D	if
B	they would go all out for
D	we would consider doing whatever you wanted to for tennis whether that was going to
B	apart from you can't to Spain no more
D	of course we would but we have two boys
C	who both play tennis
C	who who both play tennis
D	who both play tennis you play
A	and you play
D	football
C	and hockey
A	and hockey
D	you do hockey you do everything
C	I well do you want me to tell you
D	in your mind
C	only joking
A	what even is softball?
C	I'm only joking
B	I broke a year six heart on the year six induction day
C	yeah I know that guy cos you'd
A	what?
B	got him out didn't you?
B	all the year sixes we had to well well for sports leaders we had to run two sessions and in the second session we we just had a like
D	are you doing your sports leaders award are you?
A	yeah
B	we've been doing it for ages but no one's there to pass us any more now
D	right
B	erm and Miss
A	what's the year sixes was it their?
B	it's
C	the induction
B	induction day that's part of sports leaders
A	oh okay
B	you run the induction day and
B	I got booed
D	so what?
D	so you
C	why you wearing my trackies by the way?
B	I hadn't anything else to wear
D	you you did a dive and catch
D	what
A	that's terrible
B	it's you
A	not when they're year six
D	were you going like that?
D	yes oh great
D	oh dear
C	then you thought you were good cos you smashed that ball
B	yeah and then yeah well basically I got put into a team with three of these year sixes and then four of the sports leaders got to go in a team of four cos we were in teams of four so I was like come on I'll take them I will so when I got my shot
B	where you have to run round the bases I was lapping the year sixes
D	oh dear
C	they got out last time
D	so what are you er I think I think
B	and
D	well
C	and if
B	you
D	it's not gonna happen
B	competitive in his own
D	no no he's erm
B	mm
D	you need to
D	yeah we do need to well
B	yeah it's five pound an hour
D	shut up
C	thought it was six pound an hour
B	he's the best junior technically
D	he he is
B	what does that mean? overrated?
D	no no no no canned as in er he's been coached to that level whereas naturally I think
D	I think naturally they think
B	yeah
D	you've had no lessons
B	yeah
D	erm but if you look at
B	yeah but he's been at such an advantage hasn't he? because when he joined the club he's had
B	I'm not saying that's a bad thing
B	yeah
D	involved
B	I'm not saying that it was a bad thing at all
D	when you think when you first joined that club
B	it was awful
D	yeah you were in the bottom of that squad and
D	about you being in it
B	now look at me
D	yeah now look at you look at
B	yeah
D	I mean a lot of them have left
B	but I still
B	yeah
C	who was that guy on the on the bike the one we were
A	what was that called
D	so
A	that bike?
D	monocycle
B	unicycle
A	oh yeah
D	unicycle you're right yeah so I think you guys have done really well especially the amount of lessons you haven't had the lessons they have you especially cos you don't seem to want them
C	I was meant to have one the other week and
C	I said can I have one after half term? he goes
C	haven't
A	want to do next year? do you not want to have the academy and do you want a lesson each week? I mean you know we're gonna have a fight on our hands
B	I think I'd benefit more from winter to in especially in the winter I think
A	hitting hit hit hit hit hit
B	if I hit more within a bubble in a just a pair T-shirts and shorts instead of going out and hitting with three jumpers on and four tracksuits
A	mm
D	who who are you gonna hit with?
B	well
C	yeah but they often go to the gym there and get
D	buff? what's buff?
D	I'm a member
D	you could always hit with me
B	you
D	you don't wanna hit with me
D	I I noticed I wasn't on the list
B	there's five people
A	you're not gonna hit with
A	oh okay
B	and I'm not gonna play any matches for the or anything like it would literally just be
D	I think you've gotta be absolutely clear that you are not gonna represent
B	no I'm not
A	fine well what is it fifteen pounds a month?
D	and if we just run
A	the trouble is you're gonna have to come when I wanna go in then at night time
B	yeah that would be the only
A	it's gonna have to fit in around my classes because
B	until I can drive
D	well I hope
A	yes
D	he's he'll be able to drive
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	oh yeah you can take me as well then
B	my Christmas I'll be driving
A	I am so looking forward to that
B	and me
D	and then and then by that stage would you hit with your brother?
A	yeah
B	if he's good enough yeah
B	well
A	is he? is he joining definitely?
B	his dad said because he's done tried hard in his GCSEs he'll buy him a membership and
D	I want you I want you hit with your brother and then I want you to
B	yeah I will
D	to hit with
A	yeah well you can do that through the winter you can go
B	he will have
A	you can well and you can you can go and hit in the bubble
D	he will improved more with hitting with you won't he?
A	and you'll improve if you can go and play with erm
B	yeah but that's the same if I'll improve more if I hit with
A	yeah but you could go and hit with
B	yeah
A	and
D	have you thought about just just out of interest?
B	yeah
D	have you thought of the areas that you need to improve on to stop that happening?
B	finish your point
D	is that is that it? I don't
B	hit harder yeah
D	was it hit harder or was it just
B	I don't know I don't know
A	that's where he had
A	the advantage? he went in there with a game plan knowing how to beat you or he'd watched you and he'd worked out in his mind what to do
D	well well wasn't it
A	but that comes from experience doesn't it?
D	about just thinking
A	bless you
D	well we're not gonna have those potatoes now are we?
B	put your hand over your mouth
A	he's just sneezed
A	over those potatoes
D	so
D	but some of it comes down to
A	straight those into the bin please
D	was was it you got to the net off his drop shot and didn't know what to do with the ball or didn't have a enough enough options to think about it?
B	I don't know
C	I'm gonna go for a shower
B	how I if I knew
A	okay
B	I would have changed it wouldn't I?
D	yeah yeah absolutely
A	and that's do you think that if you had a lesson
B	well I dunno cos
A	read those games?
A	well it's it's how do you learn how to read those games
A	and work out how to improve how to beat somebody?
D	but
B	what? where
A	yes
D	yeah
A	he's twenty-one isn't he?
D	yeah
B	I need to get to
A	is he twenty-one? or is he twenty-two?
D	pardon?
B	I need to get to
D	you will
A	you will he's not he's what?
D	yeah
A	he's not twenty-two yet yeah yeah he's in his prime
D	so
A	I think you're a really good player and to be where you are at this level in this club at this age
D	you're being
A	it's fantastic
A	how will I get around that?
D	whereas you haven't got that experience to think about he went into it with a game plan I'll bring him to the net you obviously thought
A	that's a compliment in itself that he had to go into playing you with a plan because he knew he wouldn't beat you from the back of the court he knew he wouldn't beat you
D	I think that's quite funny really
A	if you if he got if you got what was it? if you got him to the net?
D	he yeah if he came to the net he'd pass you
A	he knew certain things so he went in there with a game plan on how to beat you but that's comes with experience and age
D	you know he doesn't like
B	I told you that
D	yeah you told me that mm
A	they still are
D	I find that odd don't you?
A	it's cos it's cos they can win
B	he probably he probably doesn't hold that much of a grudge does he?
A	it's cos they can win together
D	I would wouldn't you?
A	you would course you would that's you
B	he's probably just told himself that
D	if I believe somebody had fixed the draw I
A	you wouldn't be playing doubles with them
D	no I wouldn't
B	he he told me that he
D	that
B	yeah he told me that he thought
D	well if that is if that's the case
A	well you say that but I mean he was in his mid-forties when he thought that mid to late
D	no
A	twenties or somebody that's still
D	mind you sport is a funny thing
A	what? that competitive thing?
D	yeah it is
A	yeah I don't get that I haven't got that I haven't got that competitive gene
D	there's nothing worse than losing a game
A	that was knocked out of me at a very young age
D	is there
A	cos I lost everything
D	there is nothing
A	mm
D	I get that I do get that
A	no he didn't
D	no he didn't
A	he went home he did not want to talk
B	but he said goodbye to everyone didn't he?
A	he was pleasant
D	he he's a really nice lad
A	he was a nice he was really pleasant but no he did not want to
D	bigger issue's the bigger issue's gonna be when
A	do you think?
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	oh he's twelve have you seen his technical ability?
D	it's incredible
A	yes but
B	they reckon he's
A	has he got the natural ability? or is it just all practice?
D	the only
A	no he hasn't yet
D	cos somebody like
B	but he wants it so he's got the mental
A	I know yeah has he given up all his other sports?
B	yeah
A	he has?
D	has he?
B	well yeah he must've he's down there every day
D	well the football season's shut hasn't it?
B	I don't think he plays football
D	he did
A	he did
D	he did he played for
B	oh
A	gosh we've had a lot of wine dad
D	his mum
D	his er his mum erm his mum used to run the team and er
A	I quite like his mum and dad too
B	they're just his mum dresses weirdly
D	she
A	she does she does dress weirdly
D	she gave you a kiss today didn't she?
A	she loves me she's always very very welcoming hello
A	kiss on the cheek she's lovely I mean she's very very and
D	they always seem very pleasant they always seem very pleasant
A	yes they do they do
B	yes cos
D	I don't I don't I
B	cos
D	are they that do you reckon they're that calculating?
B	he complained when he
D	mm
A	no you're right they wouldn't
B	I mean you're not bothered if
A	no no of course not
D	no it's fun
B	exactly
D	it's it's er
B	whereas he thinks he's playing with
D	I've told him that his problem will be
A	who? told who?
D	I've told
B	but he goes to a squad at
A	thing is though
B	they can reach
A	when you watched I mean I only watched a couple of games tonight with
D	it's a different level
B	yeah
A	it was a different
D	no you can't compare
B	you can't you can't
A	level
D	you can't tell you can't tell
B	you
D	you can't tell
A	I know but like like
D	but you you
D	hang on
A	yeah
D	and you look at erm
A	yeah that's true
D	he er yeah but because
A	that's just the way they hit isn't it?
D	it's the way they hit
A	it's the pace
D	and
B	the way they play together
A	he likes pace
D	on the day against
A	no
A	he was on form
B	and you can
A	he's not
B	you saw that from the
A	he's not consistent enough is he?
B	love and love to a third set tie
A	and then the following day yeah
D	er
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah he could probably reach
D	no I don't know if he's that good I don't know if he's that good
A	so could you you need to play and play and play cos you're good you're good
D	I think you're very good
A	it was fun to watch you and
D	when I've seen you and
A	it's
A	great to watch you play er so well
B	do you think me
A	yeah
B	do you actually think we are a good doubles pair together?
A	it's no good asking me I can't base it on anything I thought it was great to watch you
B	or do you think it's just because
A	when you're on form
B	we've played with each other for such a long time
A	but that's a good thing because you know each other's game
B	but do in
D	I think you're a really I
A	you know each other's game
B	player or pair?
A	cos you've grown up together
D	pair
A	you've grown up together
D	I think you have all the back court er ability I think your volley will come I do think your er volley will come his reactions are incredible
A	er
D	I think you're
A	I mean that that
A	was unbelievable
D	I
A	yeah I do too these days
D	I think you've you
A	he's much more erratic
D	of of him
A	his serve still lets him down
D	and if I mean you're you're you're not gonna go to the final together
B	they've always been third sets
D	oh they've been fantastic
A	oh they've been better than the men's finals
D	oh miles better
A	way better
D	and technically miles better
A	way better
B	what do you think last year was better than
A	oh
A	way better
D	I think
A	it was boring
D	a spent force
A	that was boring
D	the only reason he beat you
A	it was just boring
B	yeah but do you not think more people watch the men's final than the juniors?
A	no I think a lot of people watched your game
D	I think a lot of people came down to watch the men's final and watched the under seventeens
A	and ended up watching yours
D	this year I don't think that'll be the case cos I don't think there's anyone of
A	I think it's likely to be you versus
A	yeah
B	in a in a way
A	no because that would mean
B	yeah I know yeah that's the only reason why I wouldn't wanna do it but
D	well I I I get that
A	I think I I don't want to watch you versus
B	I'd quite like to play
A	I don't wanna watch you
D	I don't wanna watch you versus
B	you don't wanna watch
D	I don't wanna watch
A	no
A	but I don't wanna watch
B	yeah it shouldn't come yet should it? it's not far away though
D	he's playing every day and he's playing
A	and I don't wanna watch
A	and I don't wanna watch you
B	my aim is to grow out of the under seventeens before he beats me
A	I don't wanna watch you lose to
B	which is what? what? this year and next year
A	I don't wanna watch you I don't want to watch you lose to
B	oh no
A	yet
B	I've got I've got a whole I got the er the aim is
B	to not win the juniors er to not lose
A	I'm okay
B	to any juniors in the junior tournament
A	when you're both adults and you're both
B	yeah once I'm once er once I'm in the men's that's alright
A	no you're right I don't wanna watch
B	and it'll be quite unlikely that I'll draw him in the men's ever
A	I don't wanna watch you
B	for a
A	lose to
B	four or five years
A	and I don't wanna watch
B	and I can see him going to uni so
D	I dunno
A	I think I
D	the most important for me for for if er you
B	well men's singles final me
D	no I wouldn't like that cos I wouldn't I I I don't wanna see you get frustrated and lose the game through frustration if you're gonna lose the if you lose the game through
B	skill
D	skill that's one thing
B	do you?
D	absolutely
B	do you think I look technically correct?
D	yes
A	yeah
B	when I'm playing tennis? cos I don't think look feel like I
D	I er I think he does
A	mm
D	I think your backhand is perfect your forehand is
A	who do you think is quicker around the court?
A	I think
D	I think so
A	and I think you need to work on that
D	I think
D	so if if a few points going
A	three hundred per cent
D	I mean you heard him today I can beat
A	he steps out on court and he is
D	and he does believe that
A	a winner
D	and I
D	he does believe that
A	he does
D	I do I think he does
A	he like we've said before
A	but you don't have that but he
A	he thinks
A	you know at the very least he thinks he'd take a game from Andy Murray
A	and he believes that doesn't he?
D	he does
A	he absolutely believes that and that's the difference
D	and
A	that's a fantastic
A	no don't knock it out of him cos that's a great
D	it's a great asset
A	because
A	mentally he's halfway there when he steps out on that court
D	and
A	he does care
D	I think he he cares massively
A	he cares
D	he when he lost to
A	he cares
D	he was in tears in the changing room
B	was he?
A	he just doesn't show it
D	he was massively upset
A	he's cares he just doesn't show it he's got this thing that
D	that's between you and I
B	mm
A	I'm laid back I don't do this I don't do that but he cares he cares massively
D	he was gutted absolutely
D	but but he cares he doesn't wanna lose nor do you
B	no
D	I get that I get that and and the whole thing with
A	but he's a good player
D	but actually
A	he's a good player
D	of all the people for you to lose to he's not a bad person
D	he's good he's a good player
A	mm
B	well we'll see won't we? when
D	you can't tell you can't tell cos you don't know what
A	thing is
D	by the time you're eighteen
A	and by the time you're eighteen
D	you'll have another thirty miles an hour on your serve
B	mm
A	yeah
A	yeah
D	you'll er you'll be able to volley your volleying is weak we all know that's the weakest
D	part of your game
B	yeah
D	don't you think?
B	yeah
D	you know I could sit here and say oh you're great yeah everything you're your volleying is
B	yeah
D	er ground shots the the only person to compete with you at the back of the court apart from
A	you will be very very very good at that club
D	but again but the important
A	but it'll come with age
D	the important the important thing is where's that gonna lead and what do you wanna do with your life? and we've already talked about okay yeah you know erm and
A	if you want it
D	but you don't wanna be
B	no you'd wanna be with
D	you do you wanna
A	yeah
D	er and er
A	you do
D	you know you've got people like
B	yeah
A	yeah there's loads of those middle aged women in
D	I did when I did my
A	there are loads of them
A	there's a lot
A	sadly
D	that's what I did
A	there's a lot of middle aged women with a lot of disposable income
D	there's nothing wrong with being middle aged and there's nothing wrong with being a woman that wants to improve her tennis
A	and and and they don't need to work and they're they're just
D	but you've got
A	they it's a hobby and they want to improve on it
D	but you've gotta understand you're gonna be playing at that level you're not gonna be you're not gonna be training
B	do you think that ever frustrates
A	he never says don't know do you? have you asked him?
B	do you think deep down it does? he would never admit it though
A	no it's his it's his job it's his job to teach people
D	would he like to coach people at a higher level? possibly yes
B	no but do you think deep down he wishes that he plays at his level more often as in like he plays
D	of course he does
B	tennis?
D	and that that that that was one of my points to you
A	no
D	about it was one of my reservations about you going into tennis coaching that you play tennis to enjoy it do you wanna play tennis as a job? because there are two er you know I I played rugby for a long period of time at a reasonable level
A	bless you
A	bless you
D	if you spend nine hours in a gym a day training other people do you wanna spend another two hours in the gym training yourself?
B	no
D	and and the and same with the tennis court if you spend eight hours on court a day are you gonna wanna spend another two hours playing yourself?
A	unless you're
D	you might want to
A	and then dad wanted to spend time training
D	absolutely I'd spend all my time training your mother
A	yes yes
D	but you you might do it you might wanna do that
B	what coaching?
D	yeah
A	mm he loves it
B	you're watching he loves watching people develop doesn't he?
A	yeah he does yeah
B	over time
D	yeah I think he does
A	have you asked him how much you should charge?
B	you ah just hit my funny bone no
A	and what did he say?
B	yeah I have and he hasn't replied
A	because you need a
B	I'm seeing him tomorrow
A	well ask him so that because I don't wanna undersell you but you know six pounds an hour isn't massive I know you're only sixteen but it's not massive is it? no?
D	six pounds an hour it's not bad
A	no I know but he's done two levels of coaching we've paid for that
A	it's er I know but I know he's only young but you don't want to
D	he's young
A	undersell him
D	and no he's doing it as pocket money that's the problem if he was doing it as a job you'd be saying hang on I want twenty quid an hour for that
A	well you do yeah but he's got the qualifications to charge twenty quid an hour but because he's erm
D	I know
A	because of his age and what he's doing you you can't undersell him
D	do you wanna teach
D	do you mind teaching
B	no it's fine
D	have you spoken to
B	no
A	do you want us to? we need to say to him
A	I know but we need to say you're doing that because
B	I think I've told him that before
A	have you?
D	I'll speak to him tomorrow when I beat him
A	yeah
D	cos he won't be in a position to talk to me then
A	it's more
D	well no it's
A	and
D	well I'll I'll speak to
A	but
B	yeah but
B	yeah but I
A	oh no not them he just said
D	no he didn't say he he mentioned
A	yeah
D	that's what he said
A	I don't think he
D	he didn't mention anyone else
A	yeah but
D	he he'd pay
A	yes you should take that
B	yeah I would coach him but you have to go through like
D	yeah you do
A	is it
B	I dunno well
D	oh I'll speak to
A	we need to sort it out
B	one of them is meant to give you
A	yeah we're meant to sort that out
D	are you comfortable with what you're doing with
B	most of it yeah
D	what do you mean most of it?
A	he's only done it don't it twice
B	yeah I've only done it twice
A	but we need to say to
D	it's not only that let's be honest it's that it's about the fact that
A	no absolutely yeah no I I agree
D	and and if anything was to happen to any of us
A	oh
D	and and
A	they'd look after us we'd look after them
D	and
A	yeah yeah
D	needed to go round to their house because there was a problem
A	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	that they they would drop everything to look after our boys or or anything like that so
B	yeah they would
A	they would and we we'd look after them so yeah we don't wanna charge them
D	no I don't I I er cos
A	mm yeah
D	I think erm I'll do you want me to speak to
B	yeah you can or I can it doesn't bother me
A	but if if
D	you need we need a chat we need a
A	no
D	after the amount of time
B	mm
D	that
A	no
D	and if anything we we you know if you ended up doing the amount of sessions that she did with you we'd end up having to well we should pay you rather than her but mum's done that because er you defrauded her
A	yes with your bus money
D	so what are we doing about your career?
A	it's quite shocking
B	this conversation never ends well so why are you starting it?

B	oh please
A	what what? with these three bottles of wine?
B	yeah
B	it's not gonna end well
A	the two

A	yeah I know yeah
A	that's that's two bottles of wine in
D	no I I I've recommended to you that you go into business haven't I?

D	you can go into sports business well funnily enough I I
A	dad saw a job
D	yeah I did just I was just about to say
A	oh go on tell him
D	I've just seen a job for operations director of
B	are you actually?

D	no
A	that's that's not far
D	what it's forty minutes down the road for me

D	it's on the board on the board of directors
A	your dad's
B	so you're up for
A	your dad's that level
D	yeah
A	he's high
A	he's gonna apply for that job
B	well if you just go there I can become like a physio
B	like I'm sorted cheers dad
D	you don't wanna live off the back of me though do you?
A	no you don't never
D	you don't you never wanna live off the back of your dad

D	you'd you'd use your contacts I absolutely approve of that
B	put your A Levels on er
D	pardon? pardon?
B	put your A Levels on your CV to
B	dad
D	you've probably with this recording you've probably bottomed out my application thanks for that
B	no you should apply for that
A	I think so be fun
B	I mean even if they say no you've got nothing to lose say yes well board of director you're in three hundred K
D	no it's not that much money
B	can't be far off that
D	no
B	now that
D	it's not it's it's reasonable money but I don't think it's anywhere near that I haven't looked at it it's
B	it must be quite a bit more than what you're on
D	I'm paid quite well
B	yeah but
A	anyway be fun wouldn't it? you'd like that not being away from home?
D	I would like I would like not to be away from home but it would mean that I couldn't I
B	that would be an interesting change
D	a significant amount of weekends I'd be at work
A	we'd all have to support
D	we'd
B	we'd have a box
D	well you would have seats at least I'm sure mum would have to do a bit of socialising could you imagine that after a few drinks?
A	could you imagine that?
D	be a be a disaster
A	like I'd have to learn the rules of football
D	oh oh I don't know I I
B	and then you'd have
D	no
A	I know but I think you should look at it
D	cos he he's phoned me today to invest in this company
A	again?
D	it's up to you whether you wanna do it we need ten grand
A	you haven't got ten grand have you?
B	to invest
D	well
A	dad's got ten grand it's hidden away secretly stashed
D	well we can we can
A	we can raise ten grand
D	increase the we could range ten grand do you wanna do it or not?
A	can we talk about it when we're sober?
D	yeah
A	okay let's talk about it tomorrow
B	what's the business?
D	he's into er
A	beauty
D	he's got a
A	what on beauty treatments?
B	what a full
A	what do you know about beauty treatments?
B	a full time job?
D	thanks
B	is it a full time job?
A	I'll I'll be the guinea pig
D	pardon?
A	I'd like this
B	is it a full time job er with
D	no no no this is when you when you get
B	is like a side business?
D	yeah when when you get to a certain level you can er advise er and spend well I don't know three or four days a month just helping a business out and they will pay you an amount of money and er
B	I assume his company's doing well
D	well he's only just started it but they they've er raised they're doing phenomenally well er and he wants to know whether I'd be interested in investing in that company but I would probably need to find I dunno ten twenty thousand pounds
B	ask auntie
A	no chuck it no we've overpaid on the mortgage from months and months and months we could we could find ten grand easily
D	well
A	but mum needs to think about it when she's sober
D	it needs to those sort of decisions
B	that's a lot of
D	which I have to say it
B	but
A	yeah
D	I do trust
B	could you trust
D	you've gotta remember that
B	what's that mean balls up?
A	bad decisions
D	bad decisions
B	oh
D	and I've bailed him out every time he is a go getter and he will make a lot of money and he wanted to give me the first opportunity to invest in this business I actually think it's a I think it's probably a goer
B	do you feel like an entrepreneur dad?
D	do I feel like an entrepreneur?
A	remind me again what is the business?
D	it's about not invasive beauty treatments
A	facials?
D	facials
A	non-invasive
D	yeah
A	facials
D	it's that kind of
B	do you know if dad's shares are still doing okay after we've left the EU?
A	yeah I do yeah yeah
D	but I think erm
A	mm
D	er and
A	I think the beauty
D	it is a no brainer
A	women will always always always pay
D	and even if
A	for beauty treatments
D	the other thing with
A	they just will
D	is that he for one reason or another values my opinion so if I tell him something he believes it
D	absolutely believes it erm and
B	what so best if you if you if if you trusted him with ten grand it would just be like I'm gonna do it
D	well not just that it's just I I mean we don't go into these sort of things with our eyes shut but the fact is the business could go belly up and we could lose our money yeah we could do that but on the flipside if it erm
B	it's a nice business to have on the side
A	mm
D	start it at groups
A	mm
D	he he's got that opportunity now that opportunity might fall flat on its face and if we if we invested twenty grand in that that's twenty grand that could go to you and
A	or
D	your mother
A	or to you mother yeah what do think then? what do you want to do?
D	I think we probably need to talk about it when you haven't had so much to drink
A	or you
A	mm
D	what do you want back from us? you know do they want marketing support form you? if that's the case okay we can do that do they want management consultancy from me? fine we can do we can do that but
A	yeah
D	his own management consultant and I don't necessarily
A	no no
D	so we need to have that conversation round the table
A	mm interesting though
D	well I'll I'll give him a call tomorrow and say look conversation is that
A	yeah yeah yeah it's er definitely something to think about
B	I mean you voted out
A	we
D	the company he deals with is from Switzerland
A	oh
D	so it's not involved
A	no they're out
D	but I'll have a chat with
A	Mr
B	what did he say?
A	interesting night that what was it two words
B	did you reply?
A	yeah I think because obviously he's in Canada I think he sat up and watched it
D	yeah that's well he was probably sat at his desk
A	yeah he was probably in work watching the information coming in coming coming coming and I said well we didn't stay up we went to bed we just heard the news yes we're out interesting night yes
