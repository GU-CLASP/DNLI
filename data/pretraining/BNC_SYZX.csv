A	god has taught him how how to pray and how to be erm okay in his soul
B	mm
A	erm and er it's erm it's very very beautiful but really quite erm it's quite challenging to feel
A	erm oh this is not it
B	I hope there's not a queue on the er roundabout
A	ah
B	I don't know bit er it's a bit of a bottleneck it's one of those I suppose yeah it's not a busy time of day isn't it? are they supposed to tell you on this thing when there's traffic as well
A	they do yes erm
A	not having an update so we end up we go to things that are roundabouts and it says turn left at the junction you know? and things like that so places are not are not you know as they were
B	mm
A	it doesn't have them
B	yeah you have to set reminders this is the key apparently not that I've ever done it but according
A	so I've got a like a reminder thing but I've never known how it works really
B	yeah well it's quite easy just erm select the time of day and the day that you want to be reminded and you write something in the box like key from dad and then it makes it makes a little song at that time but you have to be kind of one of those peeps that has their phone with them
A	all the time
B	yeah and
A	I can't believe I didn't take it from him or that nothing twigged but like that yesterday when I couldn't find my glasses my mind used to be
B	yeah
A	that it would know that I didn't have them with me and I couldn't see the paper and there were so many clues and I didn't remember them
B	yeah
A	that is unusual and and it's happened a couple of times and I it erm I just starting to realise that my mind isn't as good as it was cos I never used to make lists or do anything cos I had a pretty good
B	you just remembered yeah know I can imagine
A	erm but now I I really need to
B	need some assistance yeah well the thing is with looking for things I mean the wallet for instance is that dad could have moved it with no recollection of having done so and he often does
A	no that's right
B	so you know and then
A	so you then are
B	he's so surprised that you're asking him what he's done with it
A	I know I know
B	and it's like really dad? you know it's not really a time to be taking offence its just that's the way you are
A	this is normally what you do yeah
B	yeah
A	but this time it wasn't him which is hilarious
B	well why did you why did you put it in the
A	well I didn't I didn't so whatever they were all piled up weren't they and erm?
B	well it does quite often prove to be him being a wally doesn't it?
A	of course yeah
B	oh yeah now I remember vaguely
A	I forgot to text him back er I wanted to wait till dad had got the reply from the removers the remover guy thinks it's going to take two days which it isn't but we'll have to just let him have his two days so I told dad not to change anything else
B	so the
A	Friday Saturday
B	oh
A	but I personally think he'll get it all done on the Friday cos we've got much less of a normal packing stuff that most people have cos we're gonna move you know pictures and some things here that we've already taken
B	yeah it's none of that fiddly stuff
A	lots of stuff the kitchen there's hardly anything left in the kitchen
B	yeah I dunno maybe they need to time to suss it out before the start as well like figure out what goes in where
A	he did say the travelling erm so that's fine I don't mind
B	yeah
A	but if if they're coming back for a second day then it'll be pretty quick the second day cos it'll just be load the van and go
B	so then you could drive back on the Saturday yeah
A	so we'd drive back on the Saturday yeah
B	have you been
A	good
B	yeah I mean even if it's just on a stable
A	even if it stays as a voluntary job and he's he's happy
B	keeps doing it yeah
A	that's right but erm
B	yeah
A	a few hours' paid work
B	do you think he'll stay up there?
A	erm I don't know I don't know er he certainly seems so we were saying he you know he wasn't quite the same the last few times but er still quite good
B	yeah
A	erm but there was some some er sort of thing with the friendship with
B	and where's he from?
A	erm so he's in
B	no but is he part of like where did they meet is he?
A	they met through the schizophrenia
B	mm
A	er fellowship see the these are this is the misery lane
B	the misery lane
A	we're going hopefully the other way
B	oh good bye misery
A	one two three four
B	oh yeah yeah this is where we were queuing with
A	that way?
B	yeah
A	oh god
A	that's right
B	but they're not very stable
A	no it's very intense
B	you can understand why
A	mm sort of trying to help him to realise that you know? they have their off days and they have their low moments
B	of course
A	and they have their time that they need quiet
B	time off yeah
A	and it doesn't mean they don't want to be with you
B	mm
A	but anyway erm we'll see
B	yeah
A	erm
B	but you don't think that he'll decide I mean he could decide to move further south
A	south
B	I mean I know it's a huge upheaval in terms of his life and also all of the erm social services that he's
A	the support that's right
B	connected to
A	that's right erm
B	I mean it's good that you'll see him you know
A	we've got this regular thing going
B	regularly yeah so as long as that and but I just wonder if he'll feel you know once you're gone
A	it's just too
B	that he's too kind of er
A	too isolated
B	isolated I don't know if he would
A	if something came of the job or any job I think that could make a big difference
B	yeah
A	but er
B	and the people at erm
A	no they don't know
B	no that's a shame
A	yeah it you know I I suppose it's not part of it yeah
B	I guess they've just got to focus on yeah I suppose it's not part of it yeah
A	he's
B	every day yeah it is a big change
A	yes really good
B	mm mm
A	oh oh
B	we're still ducking in a twelve O the ETA
A	come on little peeps
B	come on little peeps
A	we have a little person to pick up
B	no erm we've overcome the er main one already up here there's that turning that's really
A	yes
B	trafficky
A	we just strap him in at the back
B	strap him in in the back
A	and hope he's okay
B	he can sit on my lap as well in the back
A	on a little cushion no I think you you he's be better just in the strap cos he'll wriggle and fiddle erm
B	illegal manoeuvre as long as the er when the parents aren't looking
A	oh heck what's going on? come on
B	dunno a queue
A	look this fits in here and everything
B	mm
A	mm yeah it did look like a good little one that
B	good little travelling thing yeah it's really good
A	yeah
B	and it's got special detangling
A	and nice little
B	technology
A	and nice little shape to it
B	yeah little comfortable shape yeah I've read about it before and it's supposed to be good and er good like holiday
A	mm
B	thing
A	it's nice not to have a handle
B	mm
A	no I haven't
B	it's good
A	have you?
B	yeah we've had takeaway from there
A	oh
B	it's alright you know erm
A	I wouldn't thank you for a Chinese delightful or otherwise
A	I think I might like
B	sweet and sour or
A	I don't like sweet and sour
B	do you not? no I don't either erm there are some things
A	who wants to put a pineapple in their food?
B	don't put pineapple in my in my chicken yeah
A	or raisins
B	sometimes the Chinese do some really nice vegetables like green you know those those green vegetables with a nice sauce or something I like that
A	erm
B	it's all a bit nondescript
A	I like rice
B	mm
A	you know with stuff
B	with stuff in it yeah
A	erm and I so I don't like that any of that sort of extremely chewy bits of meat
B	very elasticy bit nondescript bits
A	nondescript chewy and grim
B	no I agree with you with the fish normally they put all kind of sea creatures in it which you're not sure what they are but Thailand is like that as well they do there's a lot of seafood which is basically squid and like some some weird sort of thing with knobbly bits I think it also
A	ooh squid little squid
B	type of squid with knobbly bits
A	with legs
A	no
B	don't get it
A	rather strange textures
B	mm I like erm prawns but that's kind of the end of that
A	mm they're right on the border or what I like
B	they have to be good I find
A	really good I love them
B	yeah I agree
A	and sometimes they're a bit dense
B	sometimes they have a weird texture yeah
A	yeah oh we're right there
B	I know not liking it
A	erm
B	we went to this place a couple of times in Thailand which we didn't we don't like very much but they do with some friends and they erm it's like a buffet it's kind of a traditional way to eat
A	mm
B	erm they come with a boiling hot sort of well in the middle of the table with water at the bottom and a kind of a a raised bit with a blob of fat basically and you go to this massive buffet and you choose all this raw food and they have like meat seafood vegetables and different stuff and then you cook it yourself in this kind of
A	vat
B	vat of everyone else's food as well and erm it's just basically really grim but what reminds me is that you get prawns but they're like not cooked yet so they're that grey colour
A	mm
B	which is really off putting erm but if you do buy them fresh like that and then cook them yourself they have that really nice texture instead of the kind of
A	okay
B	massively over heated dense
A	yeah yeah
B	thing but yeah gosh they have a lot of weird looking creature that you can put in your bowl you know it's not that nice and nothing tastes of anything cos
A	well you've just boiled it in water
B	you've just boiled it in water yeah and the fat as some flavouring in it I don't know I'd rather have a someone
A	yeah well it's a kind of a bit like erm what's it called that's not fondue that's
B	yeah exactly
A	cooking your meat in the middle of the table
B	yeah you yeah we have it as well don't we? erm it has a special name
A	I can't remember
B	raclette you have as well
A	oh that's right
B	raclette is nice though raclette is when you
A	that's frying it on like a little frying pan
B	fry the
A	have as much as you like
B	it's really popular er amongst the Thai people and they have a chain which is built around the same concept and in fact I did it before in China with that family that was like the special meal that they did for me
A	oh gosh
B	of was this
A	yeah
B	I don't know what it's called I'm afraid buffet of raw food
A	DIY dinner
B	kind of sort of yeah like a vat of soupy water in front of you no idea
A	sounds horrid so
B	er yeah I'd rather eat other things but it's nice kind of experience
A	I suppose that's it isn't it? it's the same as us with a
B	fun mm
A	it's the sort of sharing idea
B	mm
A	why are there no other cars here? only two minutes to go
B	I know that's what I was thinking as well
