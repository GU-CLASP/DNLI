A	it's like two
B	right
A	but it's
B	mm
A	I reckon even if I can't learn all of it it won't matter that much

A	but then it's like
B	did it go everywhere? oh
A	sardines in a can
B	oh right
A	next to all these girls who are just talking about the most superficial horrible things
B	oh gosh
A	the whole journey and I
B	really?
A	the I because I wasn't prepared I didn't have time to put my music on I didn't have time to take my coat off
B	oh right
A	so I'm shoved in there
B	ah
A	very nearly late
B	really?
A	moved so slowly
B	oh my goodness
A	hideously slowly
B	oh gosh
A	I just
B	was it worse than the school bus then? the college bus?
A	yes
B	really
A	it was so much more packed
B	oh no
A	I was like
B	oh my goodness
A	yeah
B	that's awful
A	yeah
B	so you you don't wanna experience that again then?
A	it was horrible
B	yeah cos like how much was it for a single?
A	oh I dunno two pounds thirty
B	right
A	and it was four pounds something for a return
B	oh gosh
A	cos I thought I'll just get a return and she's like they're four pounds something I was like
B	oh yeah
A	okay
B	yeah that would've been a disaster if you didn't
A	yeah because it was like I can't
B	yeah
B	I guess you will go in at peak time maybe the bus wouldn't be so bad you know on?
A	yeah if I went earlier maybe but even
B	yeah
A	but then I'd be leaving earlier than I'd have to if I just cycled
B	yeah
A	I mean I know I wouldn't get as wet but still
B	do you know what I was gonna say you know that erm
A	yeah
B	you could have that
A	oh right

A	mm
B	for cycling
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well fineish
B	yes yeah
A	yeah the really like massive ones
B	yeah they are massive
B	but the thing is it doesn't matter
A	no
B	really erm
A	yeah
B	I mean no one's gonna see me
A	yeah who cares?
B	and er as long as they're dry when I get to work cos oh it's horrible having to sit
A	yeah
B	although I have to say those boots I was really impressed with how they er fared today
A	oh that's good
B	although they were wet all the way
A	were they wet on the inside?
B	no that's it they were a sealed unit
A	oh so
B	so
A	that's what you want
B	yeah

B	I have sacrificed many thing for you over the years and that
A	oh yeah okay yeah to be fair I haven't
B	I I I hope
A	I'm just
A	a shirt or whatever and I'm thinking oh yeah have the boots
A	but you should probably have about ten pairs of boots by now
B	mm
A	yeah
B	would you would you dare wear them to college?

B	even though they're
A	but you know what squelch in between classes in wellies

A	no we don't need to just spend money on shoes no
A	I survive fine to be fair
B	do you get lockers at college?
A	no I think you might in the second year
B	oh right

B	mm cos that would handy like for wet you know for wet stuff if you were
A	it would be it would be really nice
B	mm
A	my oh
B	oh god that is the worst isn't it?

A	yeah I know you're right
B	it's you know?
A	I do that I'm I'm
A	but it's got all these books that I want to read on it

A	designed for me
B	I can't believe that he got that in an auction
A	who did?
B	right uncle
A	oh did he?
B	did he not tell you the story behind it?
A	no
B	he
A	I thought maybe grandad had bought it for him a while back
B	no no no erm
A	mm
B	CBs

A	I might
A	okay uncle

A	but I it's got all these books that I'm always like oh I'll get that at the library
B	yeah
A	you have to reserve it
B	yeah
A	I can't get it out of the library so it's got all these things on it
B	well you could but you'd just pay money
A	yeah but then you have to pay sixty pence for it every time
B	but it is it is a bit
A	as if someone with similar reading tastes I dunno
B	yeah but no I'm sure
A	maybe I owned it in a past life
A	no I'm I'm too
A	I can't even figure it
A	yeah
B	ah
A	I'm too
B	uhu
A	so I couldn't've owned one in a past life
B	uhu
A	that's the one
B	yeah
A	well it's it's questionable
B	I wasn't even going to attempt to unravel that but it's like no

B	it's a spade isn't it?
A	it's just a very long shovel
B	spade yes
A	yeah
A	definitely
B	mm
A	well
B	I guess they're probably gonna do the
A	yeah but we have to pay to get in
B	yeah
A	it's like two pound on the door one pound whatever
B	it's no big
A	no
B	but it's just the yeah and I and I guess it's the principle as well cos it
A	it used to be free
B	erm
A	oh
B	erm
B	I mean
A	whoopee for you
B	oh I know
A	just say

B	er
A	okay
B	and he said well you know if you can't find anything I have got my own personal

B	the other day but I just where is it?
B	where is it?
A	you know?
B	in this house of many things and

A	yeah gotta go in there
B	definitely gotta go there
A	oh right
B	so either actually either way I've I better get one of each

A	yeah
B	well maybe you ought to start some crowdfunding for that
B	I tell you what that's what everyone's doing these days to get get things going
B	did you see about that Wonderland book?
A	no
A	mm
B	by
A	right
B	and she had a muse that she used in all of the
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but the quality of the photos was
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	really really incredible and she just created this whole world of her mother's stories and there was about
A	oh
B	think there was about eighty shots in there
A	wow
B	just
A	yeah
B	each one and
A	yeah
B	quality of the
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so she met
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and she basically crowdfunded it she put it out on her
A	mm
B	Facebook page that she was trying to
A	mm
B	and what she did was she offered
A	perks
B	basically there were sort of three different packages if you paid
A	yeah yeah yeah
A	I know how it works
B	yeah yeah yeah?
A	yeah I've seen em
B	so there was collector item ones and all the rest of it
A	yeah

A	after a while and they were like
B	yeah
A	we need
