B	yes
A	yeah cos they're at they sometimes want to be in
B	yes
A	and er what do you think about
B	it would be very narrow
A	is it?
B	very narrow I would think
A	yeah
B	it fluctuates
A	does it?
B	yes and erm
A	oh yeah
B	yeah I would like to see
A	so all the best for her then?
B	yes
A	is she standing again this time do you think?
B	yes and she is a young woman
B	yeah because
B	no
A	they have yeah I could easily see this place like UKIP doing well here
B	no I don't agree there
A	no you not think so?
B	no no
A	no
B	not in an affluent place
A	actually no you're right yeah
B	oh yes
A	yeah they are very erm
B	yes
A	a lot of the time yeah
B	yes I stay up until the er the first one
A	yeah
B	I believe
A	don't they? what time does Sunderland usually come in at?
B	er about
A	oh right they like to get it counted quickly then
B	yes
A	yeah well they tend to go Labour anyway so I wouldn't
B	yes
A	imagine there's much dispute there
B	yes I would definitely think so
A	yeah
B	yes but not too bad one follows pretty quickly after but not that quickly
A	okay I see
B	yes I knew it was a lady but she hasn't been very
A	mm no they will change all the boundaries again soon
B	mm
A	because
B	I er just got another one sent this morning for the local elections
A	of course
B	and one for general elections and I think it it tells me when it will be about another fortnight before they
A	oh okay I would like to see what the the sheet looks like with everyone on
B	it's in the kitchen
A	oh
B	yeah because er
A	yeah
B	er so erm I
A	I think they either do get us
B	mm well yes
A	we may as well do the other at the same time yeah
B	but then again older people might get might get a bit confused
A	yeah oh of course yeah
B	I think it'll be it will be the older people that'll go out and make the effort
A	yep
B	I would like to see more younger people
A	cos there are a lot of people who can't make their mind up
A	and will just say no
B	there's a lot of people who can't be bothered
A	yeah that's not good
B	but I am pleased that younger people in schools are taking
A	yeah because our school have had the candidates in
B	yes and younger people are getting more involved in politics
A	yeah
B	which is a good thing
A	that's what we want you can see here there's more younger MPs as well it is not all the same
B	yes
A	mm then because in the Scottish referendum there was quite a high turnout there
B	yes
A	with a lot more younger people getting involved
B	yes
A	which was a good thing
A	exactly I don't think we'll see something like that anymore for a long time whether it's in or out
B	yes
A	she says there's no reason we can't be friends but different countries that's what she says
B	she
A	she was a nice person that
B	yes
A	and that fella afterwards said that Nicola Sturgeon won the Scottish they say
B	really
A	most people think she performed the best
B	oh I don't know who were
A	I think all the
B	they are all the same
A	all the polls say something different really you can't tell can you?
B	I felt sorry for them standing all the time
A	yes
B	they must have been tired
A	they got a break halfway through
B	yes
A	but apart from that
B	yes yes
A	but that wasn't long either just a few adverts
B	erm
A	yeah
B	were wanting to do
A	are there anymore debates or is that?
B	I've no idea
A	I think there was one that they were going to have a three
B	like they did last time
A	yeah
B	yes
A	but er Cameron didn't want to have one on one with Miliband that's why they had that thing the other week
B	yes
A	where Paxman just gave them the questions
B	yes Miliband came over alright but er I don't think he has what it takes
A	no
B	to be
A	it will be really close to call
B	yeah absolutely I think his brother was the better of the two
A	at speaking to people appealing to people yeah
B	yes and he was a big favourite of Tony Blair's because the night that Tony Blair flew flew down
A	yeah
B	when he knew he was in he took er
A	what happens? what happened to David Miliband?
B	he's he went over to the
A	yeah
B	and he did quite a bit there but apparently he is getting more friendly now with his brother
A	oh that's good
B	there's a possibility he might be coming back but I don't know whether
A	cos if
B	it would be as a politician
A	is he going to be standing in the as an MP?
B	I don't well not at the moment no because that would makenews wouldn't it?
A	yeah it would so he won't be in the Cabinet then?
B	I think he was
A	he was somewhere around there wasn't he? yes
B	and this er er because we stayed up that night
A	yeah
B	when he said who was taking down
A	because
B	oh right
A	it says here I'm seeing if there's any other people that I recognise on here
B	yes yes
A	but he is not standing this time
B	yeah but he's retiring isn't he?
A	he's retiring as well
B	he's been there since he was about 16 hasn't he?
A	oh yeah
B	in politics
A	yeah he was
B	yeah but then I don't think he had what it takes either
A	nah his people didn't like him nowadays it's got to be somebody who comes across well on the TV hasn't it?
B	yeah and you have got to have personality and lacking passion
A	not good
B	no
A	it could be then if you took away the podiums it could be any of the same people speaking
B	yeah yes
A	it is not how it used to be
B	I once went to a a meeting outside and the mayor-elect the council was beaten
A	gosh I bet that was big news
B	and people screamed it had never not been known before and they were delighted
A	mm yeah
B	but if that passion is lacking
A	it is that yeah people just yeah
B	right
A	or it is quite marginal
B	yes
A	it could define the election
B	yes
A	yeah
B	he is a young fellow I believe
A	he looks like it yeah I'm looking at the result from last time gosh it was very close very close indeed
B	will they not?
A	I can't well I can't see them having many
B	no
A	because they haven't been on any of the
B	no
A	no they're finished they've all migrated to UKIP now I think
B	I think UKIP will get quite a few votes but
A	I can't see them taking too many seats though
B	no I can't but er
A	mainly around the south east like in Kent and right on the
B	yes
A	where they have got a couple now on the estuary
B	and it is immigration there isn't it
A	that seems to be the
B	yes
A	the turnout at Stockton was sixty-seven point four percent last time around
B	mm
A	I
B	possibly yeah
A	it will be interesting to see what the weather's like because that can have a big effect on
B	yeah
A	mm because if it is raining people don't want to go outside
B	and they've got to have people ready to give lifts to elderly people who want to vote that can't go and vote because
A	oh that's a good idea
B	yes and
A	yeah
B	and er the Labour man
A	mm
B	and said well you send somebody around
A	yes
B	and I was very disillusioned he didn't
A	because you can vote by proxy as well can't you? send someone in
B	yes
A	I'd never
B	but that was
A	I'd never trust someone to do that
B	that was quite a few year ago but there was no proxy voting then
A	oh right
B	and it was the Labour people that wanted to go especially older ones and erm he didn't and that particular fellow I forget his name now he was he was elected a Member of Parliament and he was only there for I think it was a month but I can't remember his name I don't know what happened
A	mm I remember last time around the UKIP candidate for this constituency died and so our constituency waited months
B	ah
A	after before it was revealed do you remember that?
B	no I don't remember that
A	ah well you wouldn't have noticed because you had a postal vote but the people who went to the station
B	yes
A	had to go a couple of weeks after because they had to fix up who was going to be his replacement and then adopt him and everything
B	right
A	to see if he was alright and then
B	right
A	obviously it were no surprise but it was interesting to see the result
B	now we had a man
A	yeah
B	and he said
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	and then there's all the people who count up the votes as well
A	yeah
B	I think he got in that night
A	did he?
B	mm
A	how do they count them up? do they put all the ones for the same party on a pile?
A	yeah
A	because there must be some mistakes sometimes
B	I would like to be there to get get the atmosphere
A	ah yeah it would be good
B	I would love that you know it would be
A	because I remember when they were voting for the London mayor
B	yes
A	they kept having recount and recount and it was changing so there must be a lot of mistakes because they were recount recount recount
B	yeah and they are counting late at night as well
A	yeah and if if you were a biased counter you could either just slip one of the opposition underneath no one checks it do they?
B	no I suppose they don't no I wouldn't have thought of that but yes I suppose yes
A	I mean there would massive fines and everything if you did do that
B	and I think it is a good idea the polling stations are always closed at nine o'clock they are closing at ten now
A	ah that's good yeah
B	and that gives
A	exactly yeah
B	run up he is always the last one because he is late in from work
A	yeah cos there'll be a lot of people who vote cos I've seen people people
B	and there used to be terrific queues
A	yeah
B	and the people on the door as you went to vote were usually people that were employed by the council
A	yeah
B	in the offices and that and they took your name and that
A	because there's
B	they do they do make a change because I knew
A	oh do they?
A	I see yeah
B	but he enjoyed doing it
A	because when I've called in with
B	ah yes
A	we've always gone in quite early and seen them there
B	right
A	and then going in with my dad at night or on the evening
B	but young people must be encouraged to go and vote
A	yeah what do you think about voting at sixteen?
B	I agree with it
A	yeah
B	especially when they are being educated at school with these people coming in the MP in
A	yeah
B	and I
A	oh yeah because you see them in the the paper don't you?
B	yes but she is really keen
A	good
B	and she is always in at school and I notice pictures and names too of her children
B	yes
B	are also always on when she is up there discussing politics
