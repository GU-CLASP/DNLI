A	oh right okay which are the best descriptions? but then you don't get a level
A	yeah well
A	okay
A	yeah
B	is everything? is everything hunky dory? is it very nice?
A	yeah
B	or or is there pockets of people who are really stressed? and pockets who aren't? oh right I need to put these out safe cos
A	okay
B	what?
A	nothing
B	ah no
B	yeah
A	well that's why I tried
B	ESB?
A	is it ESB? in
B	well it is it would be yeah the electricity supply board
A	yeah so they did one but something
B	they're
A	mm
A	so if you can say look these are erm these questions have been tried and tested
B	the presidential age vote
A	defeated?
B	the presidential age do you know what that? there's two referendums
A	yeah it's from
B	yeah I'm disappointed in that because people just refuse to see the fundamental point it's not about making someone who's twenty-one the president it's about an equality thing making
A	yeah
B	oh no you don't get the opportunity cos
A	mm
B	you know? I mean if Mark Zuckerberg decided he wanted to run for president
A	yeah
B	but anyway
C	he created Facebook didn't he?
B	aha
C	mm
B	but yeah that's a small thing it's not like one of the biggest problems in the country
A	mad to think that ten years ago Facebook didn't exist
B	mm hm
C	so we're doing this yeah?
B	that thing is on?
A	we just talk
C	a topic I'd like to talk about maybe entertaining is what is this new thing? and
A	no no no you're going back you're not going to take it alright so just
B	it's just a natural conversation
B	oh my god awkward silence they're going to be listening to people eating
B	is that a rule on the thing? it's just the natural conversation
A	well they want a natural conversation natural conversation talking about being recorded is not natural
B	still a natural conversation
C	yeah
B	we're not artificially we're not artificially like making up what we say or
B	putting on
B	this is our normal way of talking so we should all relax it'll be fine
C	if people are new to this then they might want to be informed
A	we just ignore it it would be fine
C	okay
A	thank you very much for the dinner
C	yeah thanks
B	yeah but you say that to me every time like
A	who knows? when you go and go out and earn the money and you go and get it
C	mm hm
A	I think you have given me this meal
B	yeah but this is what
A	yeah but you don't
B	but then you're what's what I don't like about it is it ignores your contribution to the whole setup and that's just wrong you shouldn't be thanking me cos it was a collaborative effort across the whole thing like it's not just me who's facilitating it putting this meal on the table
A	yeah
C	how about this?
B	I couldn't earn the money if you weren't there looking after
A	well it's very kind of you to say
C	how about this?
B	but I don't think it's
C	hm? oh I was saying which would make
A	yeah that's fair enough
C	and then mum you can say thank you me then thank you
B	hm
A	no I think you're sense though
C	always give yourself a pat on the back
C	hm?
A	sorry?
B	sorry? the sauce or the chicken?
A	so after thanking you
B	the sauce or the chicken?
A	for the meal
B	so thanks for that meal but it was a bit shit like
B	basically
A	I'll just pick it apart yeah it's just it is watered the chicken
B	the sauce or the chicken?
A	the actual chicken
B	funny cos the one they have in
A	then the
B	then the
A	so the
B	yeah
C	have you ever been mum?
B	hm?
C	have you ever been?
A	yeah I've been in it
C	so you know?
B	you say that like listen have you ever been?
B	it's like
A	to the
C	no but you asked but you asked is it near
B	no no I meant she's just
C	oh
B	so yeah she knew there was a Chinese next to
C	oh okay
B	or at least that's I presume what she meant
A	mm yeah that's what I meant
C	do any of you guys want me to put your drinks in the freezer? so it'll be cold
B	eh no
A	no
C	I did that with my
B	okay erm see this my chicken even looks different to yours like
A	do you?
B	yeah so I don't know that's
A	it's just end of the dregs chicken
B	but they have two types of chicken curry they've got normal chicken curry and breasted chicken curry
A	oh
B	so like there must be some difference that it doesn't taste like like
B	no I'm just trying to find you a bit that doesn't
A	mm texture-wise it feels a bit different
C	oh god
B	I'm not saying it's awesome but
A	it's not the best chicken breast but it's different from mine
B	so maybe then ask for chicken breast in
A	yeah which is it? do they add on like a quid?
B	I don't know
C	you mean euro?
A	yeah I can't be bothered to say euro I think I'm just going to keep saying pounds
B	well we used to have pounds in Ireland
A	yeah they'll just think I'm quaint and weird English anyway so it doesn't really matter
C	I've come
B	takes too long to say?
C	euro pound
B	I'm sure both have two syllables two of them
A	quid quid
C	pounds
A	quid
B	is there two syllables? quid
C	that is not one
A	no no it's one syllable quid
B	it's not one syllable quid well maybe
C	quid not
A	you can stop you can stop clapping
B	okay I can see
C	sorry see? the clapping works
B	but we used to I'm still not sure it takes a lot more to say
A	speeches
B	specious
C	that's
B	actually now in my head I think there's a strange sense that specious has something to do with money which would be alright
C	so what have you been up to mum?
B	seeing as we're arguing about euros and pounds
A	specious
C	what have you been up to mum?
A	counts as a good word specious superficially
B	yeah think it's like more like it has like an edge to it for oxymoron or
B	it's kind of the same thing or sophistry maybe?
B	mm
C	mm
B	have you heard of sophistry? sophism?
C	hm?
A	yeah
B	sorry
C	I'm saying do you want to know what it would be like if
B	mm you mean if our language was the most bravoes is it?
C	you wouldn't say bravoes you'd say what bravoes means you'd say the most something that's
B	but then what? what words would you use to describe the words you're describing?
C	the most
B	if you always have to describe the words that you're using
C	the most basic words that you can use possible and that everything would just be so long
B	so then like in mathematics it would be like resolving something to its kind of simplest form
B	that's exactly what it would be like
C	resolving it to its simplest form is using words that like so let's like say X plus X plus X plus X or you can just say X to the power of four X to the power of four is a long word that means X plus X plus X X X
B	but it would depend what you mean by simplest form
C	hm?
B	okay be like fractions and there'd be like putting things to its lowest common denominators
C	yeah but yeah what?
B	so instead of a hundred it would be
C	yeah but the other way round so like making up
B	ah no because instead of using a
C	why? no but what I'm saying
B	yeah so it that's reducing something to its lowest common denominators instead of just saying it
A	do you
C	no
A	nothing I always pull a face I wish I didn't pull faces
B	you do actually it drives me I
B	which means that like you know? people think you're just in a foul mood and you're not or you're not even trying to
A	I can't help it I don't know what I do with my face it just does it
C	I think you started off because you thought it might be
C	and then it just
B	mm
C	yeah that's how you develop a
B	a
B	that's how you develop a halabot
C	I don't know what a halabot is
A	tablet
B	and then earlier when you said humorous I was going to mean
C	a part on your arm
C	or was it your leg?
A	I don't know what you're talking about
A	I know I'm sorry about my face to be honest I can't do anything about it it's just
C	but it's not your face mum it's what you do with your face
B	no but one thing about your face is your facial expressions we were commenting on
C	yeah
B	we weren't like that's a shit face
C	condition
A	I know I I know you hate that
C	I don't hate it
A	you say I look terrible
B	hate what?
C	I didn't say they look terrible
A	when I go like that
B	like what?
C	I don't think I don't think you look
C	it kind of looks like
C	cos
B	like I was saying silly
C	the the the teeth are showing but it kind of
A	yeah?
C	and then they they just all tense up like
B	do you know what I mean?
A	no
B	I don't believe the bones in the neck thing is it?
A	no I don't want to look at my neck
B	but it's but it's not bone
C	it is though
A	it's not
C	fine tissue or whatever
B	it's my bloody trachea and whatever else
C	fine trachea your trachea shows sorry
A	windpipe is what you're trying to say?
C	oh windpipe sorry
B	or your or your throat
C	so your windpipe is a square?
B	square? I never said it was square
C	cos look cos look this is like a square there's four bones like that and that look
A	supposed to be
B	I'm not saying there's no bones in your windpipe there could be cartilage and things I'm just saying the bit you see
A	anyway I apologise about my face I you just have to ask me how I'm feeling anyway so
C	what are you feeling now?
B	cos when you think someone's feeling cross you don't go and ask them how they feel that's the whole point it's a warning sign to back the fuck off whoops sorry
A	no but I never do cross things to people
B	but it's contrary what's that word?
A	I don't make people put I mean I don't like ignore people or do things that are kind of not
B	no we're not saying this is a monstrously huge problem or anything
A	so it's kind of weird that people pick up things would pick up something like that if I've not ignored them if I'm perfectly nice and had no weird tone in my voice or anything and then just because my face looked kind of weird just seems a little bit unfair
C	mum if a guy went up to you like this
C	no but you'd be like
B	actually
C	I thought you guys went shopping there's nothing in the fridge
A	we just did it all for ourselves and not you
C	okay
A	we didn't go shopping
C	oh
B	no
C	okay
A	but I don't do that I don't go
B	what?
C	mum what you just did there is nothing
C	that's something like that's something like
A	hello
A	I'm
C	you're a horrible actor sorry
B	have you any more
B	aw jesus than to prove him right
A	I can do any accents you you choose can do Brummie I can go right hello would you like some chips?
C	that
C	means you could be a Brummie and then it could real sudden and
A	I'm I'm really I'm not a Brummie though am I?
C	your accent would be on point mum but your acting would be erm
A	what do I say?
B	crap? is that what it is?
C	yeah but in
B	erm
A	you're
B	no I can't do accents cos I'm apparently the worst ever
C	I can do an English accent pretty well

B	what?
C	when did you learn that? and how long did you have that like waiting? four years?
B	sorry what are we talking about?
A	the joke
C	the
A	yeah how long have been waiting for that?
C	wow seemed so prepared and bad
C	you couldn't possibly
B	it would be that kind of so you're impressed I thought of it but you still think it's an absolute crap joke?
C	no I just think it's so bad that
B	it's kind of good
B	well I just did so there you go
B	no that's not his point his point is that there are very witty people on the internet
C	no
B	and they don't even come up with these kind of
A	oh
B	he said they wouldn't come up with that is his point
A	oh oh
B	that's how kind of spontaneous that he thinks it is that he's kind of going that's so dodgy
A	I see
B	he was
C	yeah
B	cool
C	call you the interpreter
B	yeah
B	the interpreter

A	interpreter
B	but it yeah but the verb is interpret interpret
C	interpreter
B	interpret
C	interpreter
A	interpreter
B	interpreter
C	so who's looking forward to Suicide Squad?
A	interpret
B	why can't it be interperator?
C	who's
B	but now I think of
C	who's who's looking forward to Suicide Squad? I am
B	you might need to explain to your mother that
C	okay Suicide Squad Suicide Squad is a Marvel kind of like spin-off movie cos it's like it's not any of the main characters really kind of like the side villains from every single main one like Harley Quinn
A	I've no idea
B	Harley Quinn is DC
C	okay
A	get it right
C	okay
B	in your face
C	yeah
B	well
C	by the way he's looking at it
B	I'm not
C	yes you are
B	so it's actually not a Marvel one it's a DC thing so actually Harley Quinn probably is in it but I was wrong at the start saying it was a Marvel thing when it was DC
C	yeah so there you go there you go Harley Quinn is in it and then and then like the all the side villains like Harley Quinn are like in a prison cell and they have they're like in jail or something and they have to like work for this guy so they all have to like partner together and do jobs together and it's like all like the side villains from each one like Scarecrow and all that
B	Wesley Snipes is going to be in it thank god
C	and all that stuff
B	Deadshot
C	oh yeah
B	mm
C	Deadshot's white
C	I'm not being
C	that's not racist it's just me playing Morgan Freeman
B	what?
C	me playing Morgan Freeman
C	fine me me me playing Mr T I couldn't go couldn't grow a mohawk and crush your nuts fool
B	you just did
C	I didn't can you see a
B	there's nothing in the
C	and I can't grow a mohawk
B	but like
A	stop
C	okay
B	there've been many Suicide Squads but the current two-thousand and fourteen one Black Manta Deadshot Deathstroke Harley Quinn Joker's daughter Captain Boomerang Reverse Reverse-Flash Reverse-Flash
C	oh my god
B	see this is what's this is why DC sucks it's cos like
C	Joker's daughter?
B	all their things are just stupid
C	Joker's daughter would be like Tiny Tina from Borderlands oh my god do you reckon Tiny Tina is
B	Tiny Tina from Borderlands?
C	yeah do you reckon she is?
B	what? Tiny Tina from Borderlands?
C	yeah but do you know who that is?
B	it's Tiny Tina from Borderlands
C	yeah but like if I say Morgan Freeman like you you know the name from what movie but you might not know what he looks like or what he does
B	it's Morgan Freeman
C	but do you know
B	but by anything other than she's Tiny Tina from Borderlands I'll stop annoying you
C	yeah exactly so stop
B	but but
A	just carry on anyway
C	is this an objective to annoy me?
A	just carry on
B	to be honest
C	yeah but I there shouldn't be a trap for me to fall for
B	fair enough
A	you sometimes get a bit too stuck
B	define
C	explain stuck for it
B	stuck for it yeah it's a very poorly constructed what would be the word?
A	mm
B	colloquialism I don't know
A	eat up
B	see
A	oh yeah
B	but I don't how to I don't know how to pronounce that whether it's antonym antinomy or antinomy
A	it will say it there won't it?
B	but but I can
A	no I don't know but I think I think
B	an tyn oh me antonym
A	so I think it must be
B	antinomy
A	antinomy
B	yeah that's very good what's with the upside down with the Es like? tym like I mean
A	what?
B	what gets me mad is that the people who write these things I know
A	yeah but
B	course they do but why don't they just do it phonetically instead of these mad symbols?
C	how do you how do you pronounce an upside down E?
A	I thought that was done phonetically
B	well an upside down E
A	I don't
B	I have no idea
C	is it like
B	or maybe maybe it's a
A	you know if you think about it it's probably the simplest way we can do it if you wanted to say E but in a different the way E is spelt
B	aha why don't they just put E?
A	no but there might be two there's two different things of E so one is upside down
C	and how do you say the other one?
A	can you just keep sitting down? he keeps like popping up like a
B	like a meerkat
C	I know but I'm putting my
B	or those things that that
B	you see
A	yeah
B	antinomy is actually just
A	oh right
B	so so antimony is an element but antinomy is the word which is exactly the kind of word
B	or a paradox
B	it's like a fancy old word for a paradox or a contradiction between two beliefs or conclusions that are themselves reasonable
A	yeah
B	but yeah it's exactly what my book
B	which is exactly the subtext of my book
C	I wasn't going to
A	yeah
B	it's amazing
A	yeah
B	you can actually click into it and then you can see whether it's like going like really small like five mentions or five million mentions or
A	yeah
C	may I please leave the table?
A	yeah
C	okay bye
B	oh my god
C	what?
B	Google have got
A	just leave the door
B	Google have got the word
A	just leave the door open
B	Google have got the word corpus in when you click in the definition
A	oh really?
A	oh
B	between eighteen hundred and two-thousand and eight from the corpus English remember the argument we having yesterday
A	oh yeah
B	about the corpus now it's like suddenly never heard of that word in that context and now in the last twenty-four hours found it in two contexts
A	oh yeah
B	it's like
B	but I wish they could show it to some
A	yeah
B	course all they did was scan a whole load of books and then
B	in everything they scan within eight hundred thousand
A	wonder how much has been scanned so far?
A	really?
B	that's why there are more publishers but like they
A	yeah
B	all those classics were published by all publishers because they're classics and out of copyright and this copyright thing is insidious cos the Americans were lunatics keep adding on years on copyright so like in terms of music like in other countries like it's the life of the artist plus whatever five years whatever it is but in in America corporations keep getting little legislators to add on years so like nothing has come out of copyright into common use so like even in America now like it's two thousand and fifteen now they the most modern music you can use out of copyright is something like nineteen twenty-eight
A	oh
B	and like or nineteen twenty there's a new block coming out this year like it's that far behind which is ridiculous considering
A	yeah
B	you know? like
A	yeah
B	now it's like
