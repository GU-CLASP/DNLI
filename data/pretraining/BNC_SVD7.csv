A	and so the other thing to do would be to erm when you've done that
B	erm
C	and which
B	right
A	and what what you of course do is erm post-process it to erm increase part of it should increase the size of the gaps because you might be able to
B	yes you could record half an hour and string it out yeah
C	erm just record TV?
B	er
B	yes also
B	yeah probably not
A	you'd probably need to avoid theme tunes
B	yeah
A	adverts
B	theme scene changing might be hard to explain
C	adverts
B	well yeah if if you erm if you fancy doing it yeah I can send you the the
C	yeah
B	if you erm
A	you've already got that
B	oh yeah I I'll always copy it into an email when you were arguing about
A	yes exactly
C	yes I've probably deleted those
B	okay
A	yeah but it would have saved it as an address if you've sent something to it would have
C	oh that's true
A	saved it
C	probably true yes
B	yeah
C	what's your second name?
B	I E
C	right
C	yeah
A	it was fantastic last weekend so we spent erm about four or five hours driving up and then down to and from Sunderland
C	covered your petrol?
A	erm more than yes
B	yeah
A	it actually leaves you in profit
C	yeah
B	well I suppose you can go out for a meal and stick the recorder on the table and
C	does it have to be grown-ups?
B	yes
C	okay
B	erm because it's from a permission's point of view like
C	sorry?
B	from a permission's point of view
A	well no because that's in so for example
B	no but erm it's slightly you know we have to have a different consent form and sort of so it is easier
C	okay
B	erm
A	but is it possible?
B	not really
A	oh
B	we've said no for this project
B	because it makes even more
C	okay so
B	erm so
C	so you need for me to sign a consent form?
C	right
C	even though the data is
B	yeah
C	it's completely anonymous isn't it?
B	yes
C	okay
B	to store
B	yeah
A	I think it's more for the sort of best practice point of view
B	oh no
C	okay I see
B	yeah
C	okay
B	erm we're going to see erm
A	in
C	okay
A	this is
C	okay right
A	er no my step-grandmother
C	your step-grandmother
A	erm but it it is erm
B	yeah we we got kind of
C	okay
A	you know you might be
B	it was
B	yeah
A	which
C	why was half-term a reason not to go?
A	oh well the A303 which is the main way to get to Devon and Cornwall
C	oh I see it is really busy
A	er yeah
B	yeah
A	and it's almost impassable really and literally
C	yeah
A	doing a two-hour journey
B	we did it once didn't we and it was
C	my grandmother lives in
A	the M4or the M5
C	the M5 yes
C	you know it's longer and it's it's
A	well here it's quite a bit further erm cos Harpenden it's a bit well I suppose there are coordinates on that map but ehIt's erm well we generally go er to my parents' the night before because it means we get to er
C	right yes
A	see them for a bit as well
B	mm and it breaks up the driving a little bit
A	in this case we're also going to grandfather's afterwards or actually they'll be there
C	what?
A	no house keys
B	really?
A	yeah
B	okay right so we're going
C	you've left your house keys on your desk?
A	no no erm I've left my house keys for my parents' house at home
C	ah
B	right
A	er
B	so we need to go back to
A	no no they're in tonight
B	oh they're in tonight? Oh
A	we're going for dinner with them
B	oh
A	yeah they will have a spare set
B	oh that's fine
A	yeah I know it's not disastrous
B	alright okay
B	yeah
A	it's just a bit annoying
B	or
A	erm O B
A	possibly
B	mm
A	I mean they're just
C	yeah
B	I mean
C	I did once see a erm a number plate on a motorbike and it spelt dick knob
C	you know you thought yes you are
B	oh
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	well not really they don't  they don't  issue ones that's
B	no
C	or swear words
A	or probably one that's not erm that's not actually profane?
B	er well
C	it was N O V
B	yeah you'd probably be alright then so it probably isn't in their erm their list
C	yeah well anyway that's what it said
B	yeah
B	mm
A	yes
B	erm we get
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
C	erm tomorrow
B	yeah
A	I do love not having a garden
C	well
A	well the only
C	but it is a lot of work
B	yeah
A	the only benefits I can think of is the space to put a Jacuzzi
B	I think
B	yeah
A	early twenties
A	I'm not twenty-four yet
A	yeah
C	in many ways I still
B	yeah
C	I don't particularly mind the occasional jobs like the annual jobs like
B	right
C	they're all erm that's what I remember most
B	yeah
C	I don't mind mowing a lawn
B	yeah
A	to be honest I think I'll wait to have a garden until I can afford a gardener
B	yeah that's the way to do it
C	yeah we looked at getting a gardener this time last year and decided it was too expensive
B	yeah
C	well there is that as well
B	yeah
C	I mean that
A	well we do
B	yeah we do yeah
C	it just depends on what you want to spend your money on
B	yeah
A	well the way I look at it is it would take us twice as long
B	yeah
A	to do it half as well
C	yeah
B	she spends an hour and she gets the place spotless
A	and that's the entire place
B	yeah
A	and for nine pounds
C	it sounds like you've got a good cleaner?
B	she's very good yeah
C	we'll have an agency in erm so every now and again you change cleaners
B	oh right
C	and so when you've got a good one you're lucky
A	well we've got the daughter of our neighbour's which is quite useful
B	yes
A	because
C	yes
B	that's why we thought it would be a good idea just
C	well there
B	rather than have some random person you know like a bit like an agency and it's just that extra level of
C	yes although there's also so my parents-in-law had a cleaner for the same cleaner for like twenty years or something and so they there was a relationship there
B	mm
C	but as a consequence they didn't  they didn't  feel able they were able to push things like
B	right
C	on the  on the  grandfather antique grandfather clock or
B	yes
A	well on the other hand I I mean that relationship sort of has to be sort of built on foundations as in
B	mm
A	early on if you're sort of open about what you expect
B	yeah
C	I think that's right I think early on you only have to say look you are not using Mr Sheen on the antique grandfather clock you're using real polish
B	yeah
C	and if you don't we won't pay you
B	in all fairness though
A	you may choose not to continue coming
B	yeah
C	I think my parents-in-law are a bit erm
B	yes
C	you know but er I think it was more her eyes she wasn't really able to spot the dirty bits
B	oh that's sad yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah and she's got a erm it actually works very well because I mean she's got a erm a er a fairly young son he's probably about I don't know ten now erm who erm used to come and sort of sit and
C	oh yeah
A	erm and and erm so I've returned them back to my mother to give to a charity shop and er she suggested that
C	oh yeah
B	it was really sweet yeah
A	erm but it also works very well because erm both er her son and herself get on very well with our dog and when my mum started to work she used to work sort of eighty percent of the time erm a lot at home
B	mm
A	which she would do and she'd sort of take that as her erm her lunch break so to speak
B	mm
C	oh by the way how long is this project going on for?
B	this one? Erm
C	yeah how much or how much money I can make?
A	which
C	well there is that as well
B	yeah
A	shh
C	I know
B	oh dear
C	okay
B	but but kind of for this phase
C	right
B	but we don't know yet
C	okay
B	erm so yeah until the beginning of April
A	but this is quite meta or at least this is being studied disrupting what is studied because
B	mm
A	quite a lot of the conversation is about recordings and about recording
B	it it doesn't actually because most people
A	right
B	yeah
A	but those will still be disproportionately represented
B	yes in a way
A	er but I tend to talk more about statistics so
B	yeah
C	well yes I mean you you're not trying to do sampling of people who you're recording are you?
B	no
C	so you know?
A	I think those are words which really occurred to me
B	hmm
A	I still think you should have employed a statistician
B	mm
C	you know the fact that it's presumably friends and family of employees?
B	erm not only we we did also just advertise
C	okay
B	for people to
A	and again there's a boundary layer of both sort of intelligence or sort of literacy and wealth because not only do you have to be literate but you need to be able to afford a recorder
C	afford a recorder?
B	well the the freelancers have to erm pay for their own or have one already a recorder
C	so you're gonna make me pay for a recorder?
B	do you have anything that will record?
A	your phone will probably probably would
B	yeah
C	no I don't
B	no
C	probably the phone will
B	yeah
C	er
B	what? Have you got er?
C	how much are those recorders?
B	you can pay anything between about twenty thirty up to about two hundred and fifty
C	I see
B	so you can get a
B	no don't worry
B	you'd really you know you
C	as a money-making scheme
B	that's not great no
B	erm yeah you can get a decent enough little Dictaphone I think which should be
C	okay
B	fine
B	yeah
A	what you should do is just strike up a conversation with some people
B	May be yeah
A	you would have to get them to sign so people are going to be a bit suspicious
B	mm
A	I should think
B	yeah
C	well I'm sure the barman's always willing to do that
B	yeah that's true actually
A	or barmaid even better
A	well no an advert for a barmaid minimum requirements
B	yeah exactly
A	I'm sure that must have existed at some point
B	yeah
C	yeah best one off to the pub
A	yeah
C	right
A	one of them was that the seventies erm a bylaw passed in Birmingham that erm in an effort to er combat
C	yeah
A	in an effort to combat the immoral indecencies of erm topless er dancers and waitresses it is er
C	it's not
A	it was required that erm slick
C	right
A	the law was later amended erm to reflect that it was possibly unnecessary for male go-go dancers to
B	excellent
C	I liked that
B	shit
C	right
A	not only which but they're also responsible for the  of parking signs
B	right
A	erm
B	yeah
C	thanks very much
A	have as much fun as possible
B	yeah
A	it's easier
B	yeah no I'm sure that's erm
A	erm
B	he's er a nice chap
C	he is
B	oh yes he's having a
A	A lunch just for fun
B	excellent
A	listen I was the first
B	where are you going?
A	A pub
B	A pub
A	seriously if you wanna learn to steer come around here
B	you're a poet and you didn't even know it
A	well actually it's a poet and you didn't know it it's a bit more catchy
B	mm
A	but still
B	you're a poet and you didn't
A	which
A	oh yeah
B	so how was work?
A	er good today I've certainly been very busy
B	Good
A	yeah
B	oh yes
A	but I hadn't got time today so having a rest day tomorrow will do me good
B	yeah
A	erm but just getting home and going out
B	yeah
A	with the parents
B	well it'll be nice actually
B	they like Pizza Express it'll bring them joy
A	yes
B	yeah good yeah the same busy really busy
B	erm it's coming along
B	it's gonna be grand
B	no it's gonna be grand
B	erm yes I'm excited about that
A	ah incidentally there's something I want to tell you about condoms but it's er confidential so I'll er
B	so
B	Good
B	unfortunate
A	used as well
B	ohhh
A	yes
B	oh
A	well I was looking and thinking is that a
A	so
B	oh
A	oh right
B	mm
A	Good God
B	I'm sure
B	posh
A	okay
B	erm but
A	yes
B	yeah erm
B	yes
B	oh right
B	erm yeah well I renewed it it was
A	yeah it was never that good
B	yeah I know I think they maybe improved the battery in the second generation or whatever
A	yeah because mine's third generation
B	yeah
B	oh well
A	within
B	that's pretty good
A	so it should be here
B	so
A	sweet
B	it's awesome
A	yeah
B	yeah and you know
A	that is
B	yeah sorry
A	we're just going past
B	yeah
B	er yeah
A	maybe we should leave it
B	yeah I mean
B	yeah sure
A	secondly we could I don't know if you want to go to the Galleria for anything?
B	okay erm
B	Will the shops be open?
A	yeah they're open late
B	are they? Okay
A	I dunno really I just wondered if you wanted
B	erm
B	yeah yeah
B	mm I think that's probably
A	nor I'm not sure I'd want to
B	yeah
B	er I don't have any
A	neither do I
B	oh right okay
A	it's socially acceptable to do
B	true
B	erm yeah if you fancy I I don't mind
B	we could watch some TV or chatting to your parents
A	I just feel like
B	yeah
A	I'm tempted
B	er yes
A	no actually
B	oh
B	yeah cos if erm if he does
B	I was gonna say yeah
B	they they wouldn't have any more than you
A	yes but I like
B	yeah I think
B	yeah
A	yeah you're probably right
B	like people aren't as interested as you it wouldn't be worth
A	well ultimately
B	right
A	no no no it'll probably
B	yeah I was gonna say
A	oh my yes
B	the red hot chilli peppers
B	you can have chillies on your pizza if you want
B	you and who?
A	er the new chap
B	oh right
A	yeah erm
B	okay
A	and he's got
B	nice like
A	I wouldn't previously have noticed
A	I don't know but it was quite good because we were discussing how you do it and I knew
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but it was so it was in a meeting with him being involved so it was like yeah
B	yeah
A	yes but also
B	well yeah very very long
A	er I probably should from a work perspective
B	yeah
A	mind you
B	no
B	yeah but as in they might be closed at
B	yeah
A	what's the goal?
B	erm I can't remember
B	yeah they'll probably be
A	it doesn't
B	oh have you looked?
B	it is sad that I know the old website off by heart
A	well I have pointed out that it's like giving
B	yeah
B	fair enough yeah
A	yeah exactly
B	maybe I should try it
B	maybe
A	out
B	out
B	mm
A	yeah quite a few but probably not
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I find it difficult to believe that a chairman of the water company's earning that much
B	why? The fact that they've got a big house in Edinburgh or you know the suburbs of Edinburgh and a flat a nice flat in London?
A	so probably quite conceivably a million a piece
B	mm
A	doubtful
B	yeah I know it's true erm you tend not to get
A	yeah
B	I was just thinking today how much I like my job it's good
A	sorry?
B	just I was thinking to myself I really like my job
A	yeah
B	mm
A	how do you mean?
B	well that I could have got a less good job or a less interesting job
B	Grumpy
A	yeah they're gonna go through later
B	ah
A	well they'll probably arrive mid to late afternoon
B	yeah so we can leave when they arrive sort of thing?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes they are
B	okay so we'll have have the house to ourselves on Saturday night when
A	yes
B	right
B	it's not likely
A	yes
B	I'll probably just watch Masterchef and I like it if I'm honest
A	you're weird
B	have you ever watched it?
B	it's really good
A	yes but quite probably doesn't look that good
B	I agree but I think like the past
A	I think it's a question of using
B	oh definitely yeah but
A	we'll have to decide what we're doing for dinner tomorrow night
B	ah because we'll be at your parents'
A	fish and chips
B	yes
A	I think we could get fish and chips
B	oh yeah yeah
B	oh yeah
A	it's very nice
B	is it posh or just nice?
A	it's just not as good as Gardener's
B	yeah that's the pinnacle of kebab shop
A	but that's not posh though it's just nice
B	Cos Gardie's I don't know it's kind of posh in that it's cos they're like a Sunderland kebab shop Gardie's is really posh cos it's actually Greek
A	but that doesn't
B	I dunno but but
A	yeah but
B	yeah
B	fair enough
B	yeah
A	what?
B	you know me I'm always up for a bit of kebab shop
B	give your parents the voucher
A	go and enjoy yourselves we're in for a low budget option
B	yeah
A	well they're different
B	yeah relatively speaking obviously
B	er hang on he doesn't have a starter and then he gets the erm
A	he does have a starter
B	I don't think he does I think he gets
A	he does it's mum who doesn't
B	oh no
A	to be fair to him if he enjoys it that's all that matters
B	oh no I'm not saying it's a bad thing it's just it's like it's very sweet
A	but again what a useful time to put a signal on
B	yeah
A	when you've just come
B	when you've just
A	to a halt
B	yeah
A	I know
A	I think he'll like the gesture yes
B	fair enough
A	I like this
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	no
A	A slow road to speed bumps
A	you see cos this is a very difficult going back to
B	mm mm
B	yeah well
A	that is not
B	yes
A	no but I mean you go at the right times
B	yeah that's true yeah we've done it
A	and it's it's cheaper and much bigger than I expect
B	yeah
A	I like that
B	and I mean that's that's a good commute that's less than I can do on some days
A	yes but
B	it's ridiculous isn't it?
A	and they're probably thinking it's okay to
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	there's no reason not to
B	mm
A	a clear open road good weather good visibility
B	yeah
A	it's daft
B	now due care and attention
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	it's an offence
A	it'd be a traffic offence
B	yeah
A	er
B	mm
A	in essence yes
B	we got an email through one today saying erm there's been a crackdown on cyclists so erm fifteen cyclists have been given thirty pound spot fines for things like not having lights and going through red lights and cycling on the paths
B	mm
A	you could just
B	unless they've made themselves very visible because cyclists will tend not to cycle through a red light if there's a policeman standing on the corner watching
A	well I've seen them do it
B	have you?
B	mm
A	they give you a pair as well don't they?
B	they didn't mention that on the thing but yeah the last time they did it they did
A	not repeatedly
B	no no true
A	yes but I think because
B	yeah well that's
B	he did  He did  then say erm you know instead of erm having an accident when your light's on
A	yeah
B	it's a critical thing
A	basically
B	that's poor
A	you've decided you're gonna do forty-five for the entire
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	I might give
A	sorry?
B	I might give
A	yeah
B	yeah if you're not gonna be er around for a little while
A	I suppose you and she have more to talk about than
B	we do cos her life's quite interesting at the minute or just
A	well I'm not saying
B	yeah
A	yes
B	I think which I think she likes
A	no it would have been on Facebook if she knew
B	that's what I mean I haven't seen her Facebook page in a few days
A	yes
B	have you seen
A	no
B	mm
A	okay
B	she's not like she
A	that she
B	that
A	she uses it to make sly comments and that's about it
B	yeah pretty much yeah
A	oh and
B	yeah
A	no
B	I used to dislike that but now you know now they're actually kind of having a baby and moving in I'm like glad that there's excessive PDAs
A	yes
B	the PDAs you might not have
A	you mean DDAs?
B	what's DDAs?
A	discrete displays
B	yeah exactly
A	I indoors
B	indoors is perfect
A	oh well you could  you could  term public as being outside
B	you could but you'd also define the term public as being
A	yes
B	in
A	yeah
B	mm
A	this would be so mind-numbing to have to drive
B	yeah
A	one does to work
B	and frustrating right at the end of your journey
B	to have to sort of sit on this bit and oh God
A	and
B	yeah
A	along here
B	right well
A	which it was
B	wow so you really could just bomb along
A	because the places
B	yeah
B	mm yeah
B	yeah I've enjoyed them
A	I agree
B	what the one in Ely?
A	yeah
B	yeah I know
B	they're just a company I think as in there's like a logo and stuff and you can buy
A	so how does that work
B	I'm not sure
A	because stores obviously it would make sense to give tokens out because they
B	yeah
B	I'm not sure
A	or they they give them sort of ninety percent of the
B	mm
A	or another sort of ten percent of the cost
B	maybe I don't really know how it works to be honest
A	okay
B	that would be interesting yeah just and just to find out
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah true
A	however the erm it's interesting well you've got two amazing bookshops not to mention a very good library all in close proximity
A	thank you
B	you wouldn't be able to do that again if you tried
A	no
B	wow
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but why would I
B	oh right yeah
A	yeah
B	you know if you never stall it's not good
B	yeah
A	I wasn't thinking about it either
B	when you kind of just go along
A	yeah
B	you don't need to worry about it essentially yeah
A	yes exactly
B	mm
B	no worries
