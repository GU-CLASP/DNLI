A	okay so the plan is to go we arrive into
B	mm
A	gonna be in
B	and where are you staying?
A	er my mother-in-law's house
B	oh right
A	then we're going to go
B	is it quite big?
B	oh
A	quite small I think it's gonna be quite cosy but my biggest worry has been having a
B	mm
A	erm so we've got one I've got two in fact his mum found one and my friend's got one
B	oh okay
A	so it's like thank god so we're gonna go from there over to
B	no
A	so my flatmate from Ecuador who's from Australia
B	does she still live in Ecuador then?
A	no she lives in Australia
B	oh wow
A	she we were there ten ten years ago she pointed out the other day we were there
B	gosh
A	ten ten years ago and she was there when me and
B	is she flying out because you're going or is it coincidence?
A	well she was supposed to be getting married in August and now she's not
B	oh
A	er through her own choice
B	uhu
A	so I think she's having a bit of an early midlife crisis
B	oh
A	and I was going on about going to Ecuador and she said I might come and so I said come
A	you've got to come and I got someone else on the case as well and so erm she decided she's taking two months off and she's coming to Ecuador
B	gosh
A	and then go down to Peru and
B	and how far is that?
A	I think she's flying out of Chile actually I'm not really sure
B	Machu Picchu
A	from Ecuador? it's a twenty-four hour bus ride to
B	oh okay that's quite far
A	er Lima I think let's have a look why don't you google it? erm yeah I remember it being a twenty-four hour bus ride to I think it's Lima and then it's not even in Lima
A	yeah
B	oh actually that looks quite far
A	where is it?
B	where is it?
A	oh they don't know where it is
B	don't be silly oh they can't give directions
A	well let's well Cusco is normally the nearest place that you go to
B	couscous
B	well flying it's flipping heck that's like flying from here to Africa north Africa
A	yeah it's
B	that's quite far
A	it is quite far so she's gonna go from so she's got two weeks I think in Ecuador
B	mm
A	so anyway we're going to
B	oh
A	so we're going to
B	oh okay
A	nearly two hours
B	so that
B	it's up there isn't it?
A	and it gets the coastline gets as you can see look it gets sort of quieter and less populated and much prettier the further up you go
B	mm
A	to about here this is a national park
B	mm
A	and it's just yeah look you can see the pictures
B	oh that's better
A	but it's also sometimes spelt with an X instead of Js
B	oh
A	because it's
B	and then I think it would be like
A	erm Andean
B	oh
A	it's not a place you wanna go anyway actually whether you can pronounce it or not
B	oh that's a shame
A	and then after that so we're gonna go to er
B	oh
A	down here which is where
B	mm
A	so we're gonna go and visit all of his cousins and his grandparents
B	oh
A	yeah and yeah
B	so how long about a week in
A	er erm
B	so you've got
A	a few days in
B	mm
B	mm
A	or closes in February
B	mm
A	so she has to go on like the sixteenth of January or something so I think probably what we'll do is just hang around the beach
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	so we can go there and should all be quite easy and we'll go sort of
B	how are you gonna go?
A	erm well
B	mm
A	there's an I didn't drive the whole time I lived there there's no way I want to drive across
A	the Andes on my own with
B	mm
B	mm
A	erm which was probably a few hours and I remember it not being extortionately expensive but that was quite a long time ago so there's Quito
B	mm
A	so there to sort of down here I think that's the only way and I think
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm well that's
A	so yeah we'll see I don't know that's the big question how we're gonna get anywhere
B	yeah
A	so we'll see anyway tell me about Italy
B	ah mm erm
A	let me find a map
B	I dunno I think I think Easter is
A	oh I looked this up the other day erm fourth of April maybe?
B	mm I think it's fairly early in April
A	oh it's around
A	often falls on Good Friday he hates it
A	okay so you're going beginning of April are you going to go for Easter?
B	no no no I'm not I'm going
A	oh good time so nearly May
B	cos it's three
B	I'm thinking I might start cos my birthday's right at the end twenty-seventh
A	of
B	April
A	of course yes
B	so I might
A	so around
B	do it more
A	yeah
B	beginning then
A	yeah
B	and then having the time afterwards
A	maybe
B	I don't know cos I'm trying to work out
A	are you gonna have you're gonna have a celebration here as well aren't you? either before or after?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah but basically I've kind of said to people
A	yeah
B	you know I really wanna go
B	I really wanna go to Florence
A	oh I've been to Florence
B	so yeah so I was yeah so I was talking about those things and my mum says
B	she's half Italian and my mum's from Rome
A	oh
B	and she was like I've never been to Venice
A	okay
B	or Florence I'd love to go and I'm thinking part of me
A	yeah
B	but at the same time
A	yeah
B	she's sixty-one she's never been to Venice and Florence and these places
A	no
B	she's not gonna go on her own
A	yeah that's true
B	so I think you know plus it's like my birthday
A	yeah
B	so though I actually want to be away on my own on my birthday
A	yeah I'm gonna go for no
B	so that's what I've come to like
A	okay
B	it it would seem
A	you've been on holiday a couple of times haven't you yeah?
B	yeah it's you know we we do like it's nice to have somebody to go to restaurants cos I would never go to a restaurant on my own
A	oh yeah that's true
B	when I go away I you know it's not it's just not
A	yeah
B	that so
A	oh
B	I'm probably gonna end up spending most of the holiday
A	oh do you think she'll
B	we
A	come for the whole time?
B	well I would have preferred not but it's
A	so
B	quite tricky cos I
A	I was gonna say
B	as I say
A	be nice to have a compromise wouldn't it?
B	I've kind of said cos I wanna go to the
A	you wanna go where?
B	the
A	where's that?
B	okay so basically it started off where I wanted to go last year if you
A	mm
B	see it a bit closer
A	shall I go
B	and look for okay
A	yeah okay
B	this part here if you zoom in a bit
A	yeah
B	between Pisa
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	this coast here
A	mm
B	it's basically it's really similar to the
A	oh
B	it's five towns
A	okay
B	so it's exactly
A	oh
B	five
A	really?
B	no that's not it
B	look
A	that's
B	yeah
B	no that's not how
A	looks nice behind though
B	exactly erm but if you go further up
A	mm
B	not there
A	that looks quite nice
B	now you have to look for the names of some of the
A	anyway but yeah what is
B	this is
A	not
B	no not
A	ah
B	mm that place
A	oh wow
B	okay so it's very much
B	like the
A	oh my god that looks absolutely stunning
B	you know hanging off
A	wow
B	and you basically can walk between them along the top here
A	really?
B	so it's really nice hiking
A	oh
B	oh god this is weird what's this?
A	it's a photo tour
B	it looks really strange
A	oh look kayaking
B	oh you can kayak there
B	so it's very very pretty very Italian
A	oh that it looks beautiful
B	and lots of walking
A	oh my gosh
B	so you could actually like check in at one place
B	and then walk onto the next
A	oh cool a bit like
B	and do it like that
A	the southwest coast path but much better and hotter
B	yeah
B	so that
A	wow
B	I want to do on my own
A	oh yeah
B	cos I love that
A	yeah
B	I feel like I can explore when I go off hiking on my own
A	oh wow are you going to take a
B	but I'm trying to work out whether to do that at the beginning or the end
A	are you going to take a GPS?
B	no
A	now hiking on your own really?
B	you can't get lost it it's by the coast you can't get lost
B	and you always find the sea
A	you can fall off the cliff
B	and GPS isn't gonna help you if you fall off a cliff
A	that's what I meant
B	maybe
A	yeah
B	maybe
A	wow only just looked at that
B	so then
A	stunning
B	yeah and they're all kind of like this there's a series of
A	wow
B	I can't remember what the other one was called but
A	oh it looks absolutely beautiful
B	yeah
A	so
B	and when I was in
A	so are you gonna go
B	so many people were saying this is really lovely but you really have to go to
A	so it's five
B	this is off the
A	oh it's a national park
B	yeah
A	so
B	so that part I definitely wanna do on my own
A	are you planning to er walk between each of the five towns?
B	I don't
A	yeah
B	to stay here as well
A	okay
B	you can stay in somewhere like
A	yeah
B	and it's about half an hour by train
A	oh okay
B	to get to the first
A	okay
B	so probably I'd stay somewhere else and then just every day go in
A	oh that seems like a good idea yeah
B	and do out of a walk
A	oh it looks absolutely beautiful
B	erm cos it
A	yeah it is a lot and it's a lot like this
B	but
A	a lot like the erm
A	southwest coast coast path oh wow
B	yeah it
B	it does look really nice
A	looks absolutely beautiful
B	yeah
A	oh my gosh look at that oh look do you walk along this is a road?
B	that's a
B	this is what the
A	oh my god that looks
B	it's it's brilliant fun
A	that oh my god
B	but it makes you feel a bit sick
A	yeah big time
B	buses just go
A	oh god
B	bombing round
A	looks worse that
B	so that
A	okay
B	I'd like to do on my own
A	yes
B	and I was thinking
A	yeah cos that's not really a mum sort of thing is it?
B	and I kind of said to my mum look I wanna do this this this you know come you can come along for
A	mm
B	some of it
A	just this yeah
B	and then she keeps saying
A	well it's not the end of the world
B	no
A	so it's not
B	exactly it's it's I've got loads of time to have holidays on my own
A	she probably won't be able to do the walking bit in the end anyway
B	no she doesn't want to do the walking bit
A	no exactly
B	no
A	but you could just you know
B	shall I do
A	she could just
B	do that first
A	go and have a wander round the towns
B	and then meet her?
A	yeah
B	well no er this is as in she would go home and I'd stay for
A	ah okay
B	like I'd have a week to myself
A	yeah oh that looks brilliant
B	so that's fine
A	so what's the plan?
B	so I'm trying to work out whether to do that first cos I'm thinking if I do loads of walking then I'll feel good about loads of eating and drinking afterwards
A	that's very true yeah
B	I mean the other way round I think I'll just feel really like
A	yeah
B	by the time
A	I agree I think
B	so
A	that's as good a reason as any to do it first
B	cos originally I was thinking I'd start in Venice but I think I'll work backwards
A	mm
B	so it's
A	yeah so where are you gonna fly to?
B	and then
A	Pisa?
B	well Pisa yeah
A	yeah Easyjet
B	though it's very
A	yeah
B	so maybe fly out from
A	yeah maybe fly in to Pisa and out from Venice
B	so probably then meet
A	yeah
B	so do that walking and stuff
A	yeah amazing
B	Florence
A	yeah
B	then
A	oh cool
B	because
A	yeah
B	erm and I think I might actually spend my birthday there rather than in Venice
A	oh
B	because there's a lovely park by the lake with big erm there's a cable car next to the lake
A	is there?
B	so you can go up to the top of the mountain and then
A	oh awesome for your birthday
B	I think that would be a brilliant thing to do for my fortieth
A	I think it's a
B	paraglide off a mountain
A	great thing to do for your fortieth
B	definitely
A	ooh it looks posh
B	where where did I look where did I I found a
A	yeah it is it's
B	not quite
A	so I've been to
B	the hotel but it looks nice
A	have I been to
B	yeah it's not
A	let's have a look cos I'm sure that's where we spent New Year a few years ago
B	so it would be up to that way
A	yeah I saw it a minute ago
B	er yeah
A	oh
A	so this is but so
B	yeah
A	and it goes up to yeah look that's Switzerland isn't it so I spent New Year on
B	oh did you?
A	oh did I?
B	god it's huge isn't it?
A	oh wow look at this or did I? maybe I didn't
A	no I can't have done look it's all in Italy
B	why were you in Switzerland do you mean?
A	I was in the German part of Switzerland
B	like was it
A	that's what I was looking at
B	where was it?
B	French part?
A	Germany
B	the German part of Switzerland?
A	no actually it was in Germany
B	it was in Germany
B	well we're in the wrong country then
A	ah it's a good job I'm not doing any much world travel these days isn't it?
B	so anyway if we just go to
A	er this one isn't it?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah?
B	and I found
A	Booking dot com
B	I found
A	yeah
B	but yeah exactly
A	have you seen the advert? I do
B	yeah
A	I love that advert
B	go out a little bit
A	okay
B	cos I can't remember the name of the place but it's on this side
A	Verona
B	and you go up to there a bit
A	oh okay
B	and it's on this side
A	yeah
B	again
A	what is it a town is it?
B	yeah I can't remember what it's called
A	that's on
A	what any ideas what it might be called?
B	well I think it might begin with M maybe I'll have a little look
A	yeah
B	yeah I think probably we can go up a bit
A	I don't think it'll er gonna be
B	oh yeah yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
B	yeah that place
A	go you're the one that
B	that place yeah
A	you're the one that knows learning Italian
B	I think this is it if this has got a cable car
A	mm
B	yes then I think yeah
A	oh wow yeah look
B	a cable car up here somewhere
B	yeah
A	oh that looks beautiful
B	and then you paraglide down
A	amazing
B	the middle of the lake
A	that's I think that's a brilliant idea
B	yeah
A	oh wow that looks gorgeous
B	it is er I love lakes actually cos I always find them
A	yeah that's true yeah
B	so I'm always amazed when
A	always
B	it's like lakes that just look like sea it's like
A	yeah
B	you really can't see
A	yeah oh gosh
B	I think it looks lovely
A	maybe we should aim to go to Italy in the next couple of years it looks amazing
B	mm so then
A	okay so let's go back to that
B	so
A	so you're going walking then?
B	not from
A	no
B	not from Florence to
A	yeah walking
B	yeah just the walking
A	the five whatever they're called
B	yeah the five things
A	five towns?
B	then
A	nice
B	to Florence
A	so
B	mm
A	then to Florence
B	mm
A	that's back
B	mm
A	and then
B	probably skip er up to
A	yeah
B	to there
A	good plan
B	I didn't realise it was so far there
A	oh
A	wasn't is
B	it's it's
A	Romeo and Juliet
B	yeah it's Juliet's balcony is in
A	ah
B	cos it's it's just supposed to be really lovely
A	oh wow
B	town as well
A	god they all look absolutely amazing all these places you're going
B	that looks mm
A	oh my gosh
B	yeah
A	gorgeous okay
B	and then
A	so
B	Venice really
A	wow so er I was watching something with Jamie from Made in Chelsea and he said there's lots of pigeons in Venice
B	did he?
A	yeah he did yeah that was his top thing about Venice
B	I think Venice is amazing cos again when I was younger
A	okay
B	and that's what all the pictures were
A	yeah
B	like it was just I never realised it was so
A	I don't think I have
B	surrounded by water
A	is that it? that's Venice?
B	that's Venice
A	but how does that?
B	there's a big road
A	I don't understand
B	that links
A	how does that fit into the rest of?
B	look
A	oh look at that
B	there's a road
A	yeah
B	but apart from that it basically an island
A	how odd
B	and then erm within the island obviously there are so many canals
A	yeah yeah yeah of course
B	breaking it up
A	what a weird thing to want to
B	I just had er I imagined it being like here and it just having
A	is it a bit like erm?
A	where they were raising the
B	oh yeah
A	and they had to raise it and on Ocean's Twelve or Thirteen
B	yeah that's what I was gonna say it's on that
A	so
B	they were robbing
A	but all the
B	and also
A	and and they had to raise
B	yeah
A	raise the house so
A	they're not floating houses?
B	no it's all
A	it's land?
B	it's land
A	okay
B	but the it's just dissected with by
A	lots of little canals
B	mm
A	they're man-made canals though are they?
B	they must be
A	looking at those pictures actually
B	you can see on the actual
A	oh it's er it's
B	be nice from a distance
A	er but it's not that far away from the rest of the land is it?
B	from the mainland no
A	oh that's interesting
B	but there is a Venice airport
A	oh but look
B	but I think the airport must be over here
A	yeah no it can't be on there there's
B	that looks like
A	separate islands
B	maybe?
A	yeah
B	just
A	oh that's interesting
B	mm mm and it's basically that you the water taxis are really cool cos you just
A	mm
B	you get a taxi but it's just
A	yeah
B	on the water
A	oh wow that's the other side
B	that doesn't look very nice
A	of Venice then all the big cruise
B	yeah so you can see like you just go
A	oh look you can get the train
B	mm
A	check it out big train station
B	mm
A	oh okay yeah they they're too straight surely?
B	I quite like it because actually it doesn't look that big
A	but
B	it looks like you could just
A	canals are man-made aren't they?
A	yeah that's the
B	so they must be all man-made
A	yeah
B	canals
A	oh we're gonna have a circular tour perhaps no?
B	oh is that er?
A	that's just Street View
B	oh I never knew you could
A	I don't know oh yeah there we go
B	oh
A	spinning around
B	and then so while I'm in Venice
A	yeah
B	I'd like to go and watch an opera
A	oh wow
B	there's some quite cool things there is a big opera house which is really really ornate
A	mm
B	and proper looking
A	oh wow
B	Donna Leon I think she's called
A	oh okay
B	and she's written loads
A	yeah
B	and there's a detective and they're all in Venice
A	can you imagine if this was your house? sorry look
A	that's your house
B	yeah
A	unbelievable
B	mm
A	erm what to read before you go?
B	yeah
A	murder mysteries in
B	they won't be my cup of tea but
A	maybe maybe not the best thing to read
B	no
A	you'll get there and just be worried about all the ghosts and the murders
B	but there's really cool things as well
A	oh wow
B	like there's so much music and things going on there
A	there's all the masks and stuff
B	erm
A	as well isn't there
B	yeah
A	Venetian masks
B	and there was a
A	mm
B	and you move around there's just like maybe twenty chairs
A	mm
B	in a really ornate room and then you move to the next room walk to the next room and then there's something else and you walk
A	oh cool
B	sounds really nice
A	so it's five towns then Florence then
B	that place then
B	that's it
A	and then home
B	yeah
A	sounds amazing
B	but I do think it's three weeks probably if I'm gonna spend
A	yeah definitely
B	as part of the week there
A	have you been to Siena before?
B	no
A	I have
B	where is it?
A	it's
B	oh yeah
A	nice
B	is it nice?
A	yeah so the only time I've been well apart from when I was three which I don't remember only time I've been is when I went to visit
B	oh okay
A	it wasn't
B	mm
A	erm and I stayed in Florence and er she took me to Siena and she also took me into the
B	oh and Pisa that makes five
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she also took me into the Tuscan hills
B	mm
A	and we had fried courgette flowers
B	oh
B	yeah
A	it was absolutely amazing
B	mm
A	I was only there for about four or five days I think and I spent some time in Florence so I don't really remember
B	mm
A	much about it actually
B	it's gonna be expensive
A	other than her driving
B	oh
B	oh no
A	don't worry it's fine
B	I knew that
B	does he try and eat them? I would
A	he used to
B	they look like strawberry
A	yeah he used he doesn't anymore
A	can and takes them out of the box and throws them on the floor
B	oh
A	right
B	erm
B	wherever I am
B	so like my brother for example
A	yeah
B	I've said like oh if you and
A	yeah
B	and just time it
A	yeah
B	for whatever place you want to
A	oh brilliant
B	lives down in the south I said oh
A	where does

A	god is she is mafia land?
B	she's right
A	oh
B	down at the oh hang on
A	where is she? where does she
B	well it's I don't know if it's the toe or if it's the heel well I think it's near the heel
A	wow
B	what's it called?
B	I think it might be near
A	yeah down there
B	it's round here maybe
A	oh wow oh so kind of
B	very
A	you must get people coming across from Albania
B	mm
A	it's a bit of a port town isn't it?
B	mm
A	god how on earth did she end up all the way down there?
B	or is it even down here?
A	gosh
B	I don't think so cos then I think she'd mention the
A	down there so it's
