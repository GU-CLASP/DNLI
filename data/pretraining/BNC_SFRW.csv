B	I was
C	so that I can go on yeah
B	I was looking at Cavtat on Tripadvisor they seem to have a very nice mausoleum there apparently
A	oh right
B	and a church with lots of work by this this artist who'd apparently one of Croatia's best sort of thing
A	oh yes I read a bit about him as well yeah he's supposed to be a really yeah a really good artist
B	mm
A	also that church I think they have erm on a Sunday it says they often have a sort of folk singing and all the rest of it Croatian sort of singing and dancing outside the church so that might be a
B	oh right nice
A	might be interesting
B	yeah definitely
A	yeah yeah there's quite a an old parts of it it's quite small it's only got I think it's only got about six or seven different restaurants
B	right
A	erm but er there's a pizza place still
C	is there?
A	yeah yeah
C	thank god for that
B	won't be as nice as mummy's though
A	too kind too kind
B	no I was about to look it up and you you called me for dinner so
A	oh right
B	I was about to start looking for distances between things
A	I don't think it's very far at all it's only a short walk but it was yeah
B	apparently it can be a bit of a hike up to some of these churches though
A	oh yeah yeah I don't know if you'd fancy that
C	aye you'd have to slow down a bit for me you'd go a bit fast
A	well we probably would up the hill as well
B	yeah
C	ah
C	and I
A	okay
B	I know what the name of the hotel is
C	do you?
B	yeah
C	well let's search there and see what happens
B	it's like
C	oh hold on a minute
B	that's the one
A	mm
C	your search returned no entries
B	eh?
C	nah I'm just kidding
B	oh
C	oh here's something hotels dot com has got something on it
B	there should be one on Tripadvisor well there is in fact
A	mm
B	well it's just that's normally where you go to look up hotels
C	erm not I
A	do you not?
C	well no everybody else is going there
B	I didn't get into really looking at er the the nearby city though Dubrovnik I didn't really get into looking at the what's going on there
A	oh in Dubrovnik?
D	yeah
A	apparently cos it's a
B	ah
A	erm when we went a few years ago but erm it you can it's easily doable in a day apparently Dubrovnik so although
B	oh really?
A	yeah which is a surprise although
B	the whole city
A	so some people were saying oh you know er
B	yeah
A	changes of scene and
B	right
A	and all the rest of it so but yeah the I was saying to
C	has it?
A	yeah
B	it sounds quite cool
C	oh yeah there there are some things here about the hotel it says nowhere to get any refreshments for guests that were not all inclusive far too noisy
A	oh well done
B	oh well
A	okay
C	no it's got forty forty-two reviews
A	oh there you are
B	hurrah
A	that's that's important
C	that's the main thing
A	set you up for the day tasty breakfast
A	oh everywhere I tell you what on Tripadvisor there was like about eight hundred reviews and although they were you know it's three and a half out of five so there's
B	yeah
A	everybody that mentioned the location just said how lovely it was there so
B	mm
A	I don't think we're gonna you know
C	mm
A	have any er problems there
B	and nobody said anything awful about the rooms so we should at least sleep alright at night
B	you know
C	well I'm I mean I'm frightened to say any more because it's not all you know
A	it's not all rosy
C	terrific it's not all rosy by any means
B	no
A	well I don't think anywhere is going to be is it? but go on then tell us some more
C	see my my website isn't Tripadvisor you see it's not
A	no but Tripadvisor as I say it had a mix of good and bad it wasn't all good you know? every hotel I've gone to there has always been that way so what have you got then?
C	well it's only got it only scores one for vibe
A	come on we'll make our own vibes
C	it says it here and it puts it in the category poor vibe
B	oh mummy that's your atmosphere
A	oh that's my atmosphere
B	how?
A	that's the thing I've always worried about
B	oh no
A	are we going to caf√©s or restaurants?
B	how are you going to manage
A	there's not a good vibe here there's no atmos
B	don't actually one do you remember when we were in Rhodes and we just went into other hotels and like watched their entertainment?
A	yeah
B	daddy do you remember that?
A	when we what?
B	when we were in Rhodes and we just found like fancier hotels and went and watched their
C	well
B	yeah
D	no no
B	cos
B	yeah I'm sure but no that's like cos we were reading up about this hotel anyway they were saying well the entertainment's not brilliant well you know? some people care more about the entertainment than others and you know? other people were saying well  you know? there's lots of nice hotels nearby where they've got lovely entertainment so
A	yeah
B	you can you can always go and get a better vibe elsewhere I suppose
C	mm
A	yeah a vibe off another hotels vibe
B	just just just sort of yeah bring back some of the vibe vibe up your rooms
B	and do they have a pool?
A	yeah it's got a pool
C	they've got a big pool but it says there's a problem with the foreigners reserving the sunbeds
B	is it big?
A	yeah but isn't that the same in every hotel? you know? there's always somebody sort of putting towels down used to be the Germans didn't it? you know? without wishing to kind of
B	did it?
A	brush a whole race with you know?
B	I didn't know this was a thing
A	did you not? oh yeah
B	so what's going on? some people are taking the sun the the the the chairs?
A	they get up very early to you know? bagsy the
C	and go down and put a towel on the sunbed to reserve it
B	oh
C	so then they go and have their breakfast or whatever
B	I can go and do that I'm always up early
B	we can become those people
A	yeah
B	and we aren't going in like the peak of the season at least
B	I don't I don't understand why people would sit at the pool all day
A	no
B	it's just
A	nor do i
B	the beach yeah cos you know? it's at least a bit of a change and
A	yeah
B	you've got a nice natural view but in a hotel
A	yeah
B	it's just a bit well
C	well it depends with the hotel and what the view is I mean
B	yeah oh if the hotel if the pool was like had a wonderful view then maybe but
A	I
B	right
C	I mean
A	well that's alright
C	well that's where we're staying
A	yeah oh
B	yeah
A	yeah so you'll be up early then
B	aw I look forward to doing a bit of swimming
A	yeah
B	in a nice warm place I think it's warm
A	yeah
B	please be warm
A	well it's saying here that the walk from our hotel to the old town is only a kilometre so it's about ten fifteen minutes
B	that's alright
C	a kilometre?
A	yeah
C	ah that's alright
A	mm
B	how very reasonable
A	yeah
B	what was our? what? what baggage have we got for the
A	okay so I've only booked one hold suitcase like we did for Barcelona
B	right
A	right but we've got one less person
B	yeah
B	true
A	cos do you remember
B	oh yeah
A	so we had to sort of distribute her stuff amongst us didn't we?
B	yeah I forgot about that
A	cos she had a big suitcase
C	let's not have any foul ups like this this time
A	well it's just the three of us this time
B	yeah
C	let's get it
B	yeah
C	couple of dresses
A	pair of flippers actually
C	socks underwear couple of hats
A	what? me?
C	few
C	both of you shut up
B	no but when do I ever wear makeup?
C	but I meant
B	like maybe twice a year
C	I mean
C	but you know?
A	it's enormous that that will be for just going on the the erm the the plane mine will fill up my bag according to
B	oh poor daddy
C	I don't want to have to stuff all this stuff it in my rucksack you know which
C	only to have my book and my I got some stuff
A	I'm going to be able to take my Kindle Fire I don't need to take a book
C	precisely you know? so you don't want it too ram-packed with loads of stuff that you couldn't fit in the case
A	we can all take
C	you see let's travel light let's travel light
A	yeah
A	no she doesn't want to
B	well it depends if I've still got physical books I need to read
A	you'd rather have a physical
B	probably be taking homework with me
A	oh no no you won't because you'll have done your exams
B	yeah
A	they'll be over
B	that's true
C	oh no is there wi-fi at this hotel?
A	I don't know about that I don't think we I don't think we've got wi-fi
B	oh oh
A	mm but listen guys you know? if you suddenly decide that my choice of hotel is rubbish and you've got another one for the equivalent price then let me know because
C	no no we're not no we're not complaining about the hotel
A	no no no let me finish
B	it's just a good option
A	it let me finish
A	it I can change it I've got an option to change it with them up until I think it's a month I've got a month I can't change the flights but I can change the hotel so it's still going to be Dubrovnik whatever
C	no I mean I to be quite frank I like the look of that
A	you do? good I'm glad you like the look of it
B	good good
C	but it what's? now I'll have to get it on the Google Earth that's what I need
A	Google Earth is the way to go yeah
C	Google Earth
A	definitely and so it's
C	now you're talking
A	from Cavtat to Dubrovnik it's eighteen kilometres and you've got the option of either getting the bus for a few euros it's twenty-five minutes by road to Dubrovnik erm or getting the boat and that's eight euros but I I like going on boats does everybody else like going on boats?
B	I like boats
C	I like boats yeah
A	oh well yeah I think so
B	I hope so
B	once by motorbike
B	you know let's go wild
A	yeah
B	let's get on a on a a helicopter why don't we?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and then I mean there are I I quite I mean I love going on boats anyway but I quite fancy the idea of if it's within our budget getting a boat trip out to one of the smaller islands or even just further up the coast to Split or something you know?
B	mm
A	but that would be a probably a
B	a larger a larger excursion
A	actually do you know what I didn't look for which I'd noticed when I was looking up the other end of the coast up Split way erm I was looking at national parks up there cos there's you know? lots of national parks and that would be
B	mm if we can find a national park cos they've just got like beautiful waterfalls just you know?
A	yeah
B	crammed into every corner basically
A	mm
B	I'd like that
A	yeah
B	but yeah it looks like a lovely place I'm quite excited
A	oh well that's good
B	oh I'm going to have to take passport photos
A	oh yeah we better do that shortly hadn't we?
B	yeah can you just like take them at home and print them out the right size?
A	yeah well you can but do you know what? sort of we have got a bit of time so that that's okay but you'll be better off doing it
C	do it in the machine for three quid
A	yeah you'll be better off doing it in the machine cos
B	yeah
C	it'll be cheaper cos they got to be at an exact size and everything
B	mm
A	and er when we I don't know If you remember
B	mm
A	and we were kind of getting passports sorted then
A	we didn't have a for some reason we didn't have a huge amount of time did we?
B	no I think we booked as long before or something
A	maybe that was it we didn't have the funds to book it till late but erm we went through the post office cos they do a really good service where you pay a bit extra I think it was ten pounds a person erm to make sure that you've got all the documentation right when you send it off to the passport office
B	off yeah
A	so you can take it in they check it if there's anything they think is slightly dodgy or might hold it up then they they get you to you know? take it back and bring it back again so that at least when you do finally submit it the
B	mm
C	yeah but we don't want to do that we just want to get it in early enough don't we?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no we were just
A	this this time round so
B	yeah
A	big run up to it yeah
B	we're just reminiscing
A	ah yeah
A	about those excellent times
C	time's passing quicker than you think though I must warn you
B	yeah no well I I was going to get that passport renewal form today but I'll get it on Saturday when I'm in town
A	oh yeah
B	I'll probably have to have to do things to it like put my name on and things won't I?
A	what do you mean all? all what?
B	sign it the form I'm old now I'll have to do it myself
A	oh yeah you've got to take that responsibility
B	yeah
A	you've got to sign your name
B	I am who I say I am
A	yeah
B	or am I?
B	do we really know that?
B	does anybody?
A	oh
B	yeah?
A	I managed to send it before I left work I attempted to but I'm not sure whether my email sent to you
B	mm
A	erm to your

B	finger knitting oh
A	erm you know
B	yeah yeah
A	erm she really liked it by the way
B	aw good
A	and erm she found a pattern for finger knitting
A	and so she did er it took her about two and a bit hours and it's quite narrow but she did this nice sort of
B	oh
A	so she took some photos of her pattern and the finish product for you to have a look at if you fancied having a go
B	oh that's very that's very kind of her
A	yeah
B	yeah I I have loads of time to knit things with my fingers
B	no it does sound interesting but it's more of a
A	yeah it's a hobby thing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	if you don't have college yeah
B	yeah when I don't have college
