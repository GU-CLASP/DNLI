A	so how do you think erm the lesson at the
A	well not really a lesson was it?
B	a lesson it
A	mm
B	I did get some good tips though cos erm a couple of them were er watching me and er come up to me afterwards when
A	what? instructors?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	they'd erm I mean they were only there as a er a guide and a bit of offer a bit of
A	yeah
B	of er you know but the regulars who went were waiting at the top for them and then they'd they'd they'd do a little bit of a a guide as to what to do next and er
A	mm
B	some things that people could try but I wasn't really up to that standard so I
A	mm
B	I sort of
B	did my own thing really
B	so erm
A	it wasn't
B	but
A	just over fifties though because there were some younger kids there
B	well that's true yes yeah I dunno how they
A	mm
B	well I dunno cos there were the people having snowboard lessons people having other lessons but in our group or seemed to be in our group there was er there were at least half a dozen definitely under fifties anyway
A	were you split into groups then for it?
B	not for the over fifties because mm people were just going for the top and doing you
A	oh right
B	from
A	yeah
B	three-quarters of the way up as well
A	when
B	really?
A	and yeah and I think they do
B	oh
A	wheelchair skiing I think they said they put the wheelchairs somehow they're adapted for skis and instructors take them down the slope
A	so I'm not sure whether this group of people there were there to watch or participate
B	right
A	I don't know
B	I didn't see any er
A	no
B	people but
A	well
A	she wouldn't be surprised if they did do that
B	no? oh
A	with them so it's good
B	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	entertaining the woman opposite us having a cup of coffee
B	yeah yeah
A	she was watching her yeah her seventeen-year-old was there about to go on a school trip
A	she was very nervous about her going
B	where's she going?
A	erm France I think
B	mm
A	she said oh you hear so many bad
B	yes I mean er
A	you've got no choice really
B	not really
A	mm
B	it was erm
A	they'll always resent you if you say you can't do things so
B	mm
A	have to sit at home and worry
B	it's all the er
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	that go okay so
A	mm
B	difficult but you have to let em
A	well er so
B	right
A	round about six in the morning drive back from
B	okay
A	mm
B	I'll just be going or might've gone by then going to
A	what you doing
A	oh
B	oh okay
B	oh right
A	that'll be good if they go tomorrow if
B	mm
A	but you never know with her she'll change her mind something'll happen
B	if she hasn't slept
A	well her only
A	her only comment on Facetime was mum I want your cooking I want your cooking we wanna eat something nice
B	oh
A	mm
B	hasn't the hotel food been
A	no er
B	any good?
A	it's
B	so they haven't had any?
A	no and since they got food poisoning it's put
B	right fair enough
A	which you can understand so she reckons they're still not right
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	oh
B	mm
A	but yeah she said oh no no
B	yeah
A	yeah well
B	Bangkok?
A	it's taken them two flights to get there so it better be they've done it on the cheap because they went Langkawi to KL and they could've come home from KL really but they went back they went KL to Bangkok which is like a two-hour flight
B	yeah yeah
A	they're coming back from there but
B	isn't Langkawi to KL shorter?
A	well Langkawi to KL yeah cos that was
B	yeah
A	like our flight from Penang to KL so that's like
B	yes
A	an hour
B	mm
A	and then they should've come home from KL but they'd booked a return flight from Bangkok when they first did the holiday
B	right okay
A	so
B	price wise yeah
A	mm it's like when I booked er booked us a
B	yeah
A	by the time we'd planned the trip we could've done with flying out of Queensland
B	mm Christchurch
B	yeah
A	that's what I mean yeah yeah
A	yeah well wherever
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	well
A	but yeah so they've got an extra flight but anyway they should be on their last leg by now
B	very good
A	she facetimed when
A	er
B	oh right lost it?
B	silly girl
A	it might've got thrown away with the Christmas wrapping knowing her
B	yeah
A	she's not particularly careful
B	be all that rubbish upstairs she's got
A	well
B	she's
A	luckily it's
B	good
B	okay
B	yeah yeah
A	so but the trouble is if you go at the time we're gonna go you you spend the whole time in the queue if you go an hour and a half later you go straight through
B	mm
A	which is what I'd rather do
B	mm
A	you don't get much more time cos I bet if we turned up at well one o'clock
B	mm our flight's half two you say?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she's got the ticket
B	okay
A	she's done all her packing
B	has she?
A	mm
B	crikey
A	I know
A	I don't think we've done the washing yet let alone the packing
B	mm
A	if you want anything else doing it put it in the wash tonight cos I wanna wash tomorrow
B	thanks
A	but that's it then
B	I have put the thermals in
A	oh fine I'll do
B	cos I I won't use them tomorrow
A	I'll do them tomorrow
B	so er
A	okay
B	thank you
A	mind you I've just done the forecast for Bansko for the next week
B	oh yeah?
A	sixteen degrees on Wednesday
A	well fourteen fifteen sixteen for most of the week so
A	when I told him it said Saturday it's gonna rain Sunday it's gonna rain which will be your first day Monday rain and a bit of sun Tuesday Wednesday Thursday looked nice Wednesday full sun and then rain again after that so
B	is this erm?
A	I don't know
B	no but just Bansko generally
A	I just put Bansko I don't imagine well it's gonna be zero degrees at night so er I imagine the snow will stay
B	right
A	you should have a look yourself I
B	if it rains it'll wash the snow away
A	oh
A	oh well a lot of rain Saturday Sunday Monday
B	okay
A	so I thought well I'll
B	oh well
A	mm in fact I wasn't gonna take an umbrella but I might now hadn't thought about that
A	so she says she's packed two swimming costumes I went two? you're supposed to be skiing oh I need er a Jacuzzi every night she said to ease my aching bones
A	mm
B	oh
A	well how much erm she always goes on about
A	and she gets a bit annoyed then she said to me well you never do that with me and
B	mm
A	I had you young and she waited another ten years and she
B	cruises
A	yeah yeah
B	he'll probably show em up
A	and oh I'm sure he will
A	oh my god it oh of course he will er without a doubt
B	so I don't
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	they they won't tell them because
B	no no
A	they they haven't I don't blame them I said I wouldn't bother
B	well just erm well some people are like that aren't they? just
A	it's a shame
B	and er but you you
A	yeah but it's a
B	wouldn't er you wouldn't
A	it's a shame they never say anything nice to them about
B	yes there should be a balance shouldn't there?
A	yeah
B	I mean we we I mean we
B	also
A	well
B	were they? oh
A	well yes because
B	on Sunday?
B	oh yeah?
A	and they were having a meal well it's all changed because
B	oh
A	erm but
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so she so she's bought him the tickets two tickets to the musical and she's doing a
B	oh
A	erm chocolate hamper
A	to go with it
B	oh okay
A	and
B	oh right yeah yeah
A	yet she's giving
B	to everybody
A	but she just
B	mm
A	so what was I gonna say before that? what was I saying then?
B	mm
A	oh I don't know you just changed the subject I can't remember what
B	I think we were just talking about
B	singing singing the virtues of both
A	mm
B	both of em and balancing up and sort of saying well
A	mm
A	no I
B	I mean I wouldn't erm I wouldn't actually say to anybody
A	no but
B	I wouldn't say that
A	no
A	no no no no you wouldn't
B	I would just
A	no
B	you know she obviously got a new job I would say that but I wouldn't say
A	yeah yeah
B	oh she's
A	not unless somebody enquired specifically about how she's doing you you wouldn't bother no of course no
B	mm well
A	and I said well maybe it's because you always come here and you never go there but if they ever said to them do you want to come round for tea?
B	mm I think I think they've got a lucky escape there
A	they've got a lucky escape?
B	yeah
B	well she's a nightmare isn't she?
A	oh oh right I thought you meant lucky escape not having
B	no er
A	I was gonna say
B	a lucky escape
A	oh well I
B	not going
A	I wouldn't like it if they didn't come but
B	no no
A	I'd I'd er you'd understand
B	but
A	because they have to split it I you it'd be okay
B	mm
A	erm and we we'd just do a Saturday or something instead and we'd change it but erm
B	yes yes well no problem
A	no
B	she's oh I couldn't
A	no you couldn't get on with her for long could you?
B	not really no
A	we had a lucky escape when she wanted to go out to Bulgaria that time with all of us that was the year that there was a problem on the site
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and
B	no no
A	which is the main thing
B	but erm she oh
A	oh she's
A	she's hard I know she's hard work
A	well I've been asking
B	mm oh yeah
A	and the woman who decorated her wedding cake said if we contacted her
B	oh okay
A	although she never came to the wedding cos we invited her but she had there was some issue on the night wasn't there? some accident on the motorway or something happened with her and she couldn't get there
B	oh right
A	erm anyway
A	obviously
B	is this the lady from
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	the cake was gorgeous so anyway we've got the cake
B	yeah yeah
A	in there I said you should organise this erm this christening not Easter cos nan said she couldn't make it and er
B	mm
A	they're like great aunties and uncles
A	removed
B	yeah yeah mm
A	now
B	mm
B	right yeah yeah yeah
A	you wouldn't not invite auntie
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and that would be a bit of an issue and erm
B	yeah yeah
A	you know cos I I was thinking back to when we got our kids christened er it was a small gathering
B	small gathering of people
A	I mean it was mainly your family going though and auntie
B	no no no
A	it was just
A	because there's probably gonna be at least thirty people when she add it added it up whereas we had about ten so I I'm thinking well it's er gonna be a lot here again it's always gonna fall to me it's always gonna be expensive so I said how about maybe having the conservatory at
B	might get a good deal
A	yeah so
B	probably
A	so go there and I said even if you're paying
A	I dunno eight ten pounds a head for a buffet which you probably would
B	yeah yeah
A	thirty people three hundred pounds plus your venue hire
B	mm
A	so I was happy with that but bearing in mind then that we're paying you wouldn't wanna spend another fifty quid on
A	oh
B	whatever yeah
A	well but they don't they don't
B	but er but if that I mean yeah I know they don't but
A	but you know but
B	but I you know why because of her
A	yeah
B	erm yeah
A	er but you you know when
B	no er no
A	and
B	yeah
A	and she didn't even bother to look at the baby let alone pick him up the boys weren't bothered
B	mm
A	it was just er you know erm
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	nobody else she says it's er they've er
B	yeah well er well yeah I know I know
A	and I think it's fair comment to say why cos I mean I was loathe to pay the money for the wedding obviously a wedding's a bit different
B	yes yes yes yeah yes
A	and they were miserable at the wedding I mean look how she behaved at the wedding
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	she behaved appallingly at the wedding
B	oh er yeah yeah yeah
A	so there's no way we should spend
B	okay
A	you know to to well to because to be honest it's not really
B	no no no
A	this is
A	and she's inviting erm
B	yes
A	to be godparents and
B	yes yes yeah
B	I I know I know I know
A	an extended family thing
B	yeah
A	but she feels that
B	yes
A	which
B	makes the effort to go round that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so she because we're inviting
A	I says no I I don't want them there at all because they just make it difficult so I'm just saying that is how it's gonna go
B	mm
A	obviously with a wedding it would've been different and we couldn't exclude them but we can with this they won't even need to know it's happening but if your mum's gonna kick up a fuss then then they needn't come either
A	no er got no quite frankly oh I can't say well you can say it's happening if you wanna
A	if you feel really bad and you have to say it's happening they won't want to come
B	no no no
A	they will not want to come anyway so it's just
B	oh I think you're right
A	it'll mean making the effort to come down er she'd hate it buy him a present possibly
A	we're certainly not inviting
B	oh
A	oh that fine you're okay with that
B	I wouldn't I wouldn't say I wouldn't say yeah
A	so er I think it'd be erm er mum from our side mum
B	mm okay
A	cos they're they're off doing their thing so those two your parents that's four on my side
B	yeah yeah fine
A	and us
B	yeah mm
A	erm and then she'd invite there'd be
B	think I overhead somebody say
A	and they got married the year after them
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
A	and
B	mm
A	but
B	no no no
A	they want
B	well
A	well yeah yeah but
B	oh
A	she's bound to
B	well he has no
A	no we're all ready for it we're all and it's
B	right
A	not happening she's not married to him you know it's not happening
B	right okay yeah
A	and they they wanna invite
B	yeah that's
A	asks about him and I said okay invite
A	so they're having their few friends then it's just family but
B	mm
A	so I think we added that to be about thirty people
B	so so is
B	well what about erm what's the er what's the other what's the twins?
A	well he wouldn't be much of a problem because it'd be him on his own cos he doesn't his family don't get on with anybody else so
B	oh right okay
A	so if they invited him I'm not I haven't really asked about that
A	but
B	mm
B	bit over the top
A	surplus to requirements to be honest but
B	mm well yeah
A	but
B	anyway
A	the best news yes the best news is
A	to lay that on at
B	no no no yeah
A	we've hosted everything else going on round here
B	oh no no they can er sort their christening out mm
A	erm but I'm just
B	their son
A	I'm just saying now that and like I say er do you know?
B	no
A	so
A	well of course it doesn't
B	yes
A	and so it's not happening
B	right well it's up to them if they're organising it they can do what they want
A	yeah but you'll have to
B	pretty much
A	deal with the fallout from your parents
B	I'll just say
A	well yeah yeah exactly
A	I don't want I don't want him ringing up and
A	your mum going oh well yes I'm sure you are invited
B	he won't he won't give bat an eyelid he won't even bother but I can see may yeah
A	well it's er yeah it's it's she
B	possibly mother but possibly not
B	these days she's not that erm
A	is she a bit better?
B	er a bit better but also but probably my
A	what?
B	I don't know
A	well it doesn't matter well if she questions it she's not coming either
B	anyway that oh it's fine whatever
A	it's not down to them to question
B	yeah I know
A	you get invited to an event
B	to me and I I'd have that's all erm
A	yeah but
B	they won't ask them will they?
A	yeah but
B	but not to me
A	to but to be honest if you get invited to an event you get invited to an event
A	you don't question about who else is on the guest list and why? well I'm not coming if
B	no no
A	you know you you can't set those kind of precedents
B	it'll only it'll only it'll only be it'll only be where's so and so? where's where er where er are they coming or er not
A	no they weren't invited
B	no
A	refer em to me I have no issue
B	mm mm
A	with telling your family where they stand
B	mm anyway there you go
A	no well no I reckon she she should do it in March April at the latest cos he's already
B	oh right
A	three months old I said
B	mm
A	you know the younger he is the easier it is to do it really
B	mm okay at
A	yeah she's
A	it is
A	no it's not is it wasn't
B	no it's
A	mm was
A	who was who was the one before when dad died?
A	big lady
B	good
A	she's gonna get in touch but Easter's early this year Easter's the end of March
B	righty-ho what's your mum doing
A	mum? what do you mean?
A	oh she couldn't no she couldn't do Easter
B	Easter right what's she doing Easter then?
A	I dunno going away with
A	somewhere so but
A	that the one throwaway comment she made six months ago is to be remembered
B	oh
A	I did say
B	oh okay
A	so we've have remembered so
B	she's booked her
A	well you wouldn't wanna deal with it Easter anyway
A	I imagine they still hold
B	mm
A	these things during the service
A	mm
B	oh right well I passed him this morning actually going out towards
A	oh
A	who was
A	who was going out towards
B	he was coming no I yeah
A	oh he was?
B	he was going past the
A	oh well well we were more or less the same place but we the other way round then
B	oh right okay he didn't last long in work then did he?
A	he had somebody in the car with him
B	didn't last long at work
A	well he had somebody with him and he was kind of er
B	oh okay
A	I wonder what he was doing
B	whose car were you in?
A	we were yeah
B	oh so he wouldn't probably
A	no he wouldn't've recognised
B	obviously er taxiing people around or whatever
A	I dunno what he was doing
A	are you gonna get in touch with him?
A	are you
A	oh
B	I'll
A	when are you gonna walk?
B	if the job has been delayed then possibly I'll be
A	well it was
B	oh so now
A	so oh it so he said to me when I last saw him oh it's been delayed six weeks so it's taken him into March but let's face it we're into March in a week or so's time so
B	I'll
A	who knows but erm
A	I'm sure it well it's Scotland so is it er was it
B	where's the job being er?
A	I that's what I'm saying
B	it is
A	somewhere in Scotland
B	yeah oh yeah no I'm not sure if it's
A	that's
B	yeah
A	we've had it down on the south coast and then we've had it on erm
B	oh okay
A	cos that's where the job is er well it's for
A	it's miles away
B	mm
A	back of beyond some sort of desolate area I imagine
B	yes
A	it
B	okay
A	you'd you you'd you'd wreck your er because these sites are in the middle of nowhere usually without roads to them
A	yeah
B	across country?
A	yeah
B	right
A	yeah so you you know
B	but don't they deliver em deliver them to a
A	well yeah they've gotta deliver them in the wagons yeah
B	a yard or something?
A	well that's half the problem because they say yeah yeah not a problem and of course the wagons can't get down the non-existent roads so that's that's your first issue
B	oh right
A	then you've gotta
B	remote
A	that you don't wanna
B	inaccessible then
A	you don't wanna you don't wanna take the car
B	somebody hasn't somebody hasn't thought about
A	no
B	how do we get the pipe to this
A	mm
B	remote spot?
A	yeah they think about that once they've decided what they're doing which of course is way too late then some bloke comes along with a wagon we can't get it down here or they can get it onto site but they can't get it down the access roads leading to the site
A	or they've gotta go through some village where HGVs are not allowed
B	oh okay mm
B	there's a weight limit and you can't
A	oh yeah
B	who's supposed
A	you can't do it
B	who's supposed to er
A	well we used to send
B	sort all that out?
A	we used to we used to spend send
B	oh okay
A	and we used to give the route to the
A	take it on
A	they would just go on day one and say
A	er sorry we've hit a block can't go any further what do you want us to do? so we used to send one of our people up to do a route
A	to make sure they could get there
B	yeah cos it's their their
A	well
B	job from
A	you'd think so
B	the port to the
A	they're doing er yeah
B	right
A	oh it was everything's a nightmare the
A	it is
B	well thick men clearly
A	well men
B	thick men
A	they
A	they just go back to this oh we've gotta get here oh computer says no
B	stupid
A	satnav says no can't do it can't do it and of course if the weather gets bad and the roads get cut off oh you name it
B	yes
A	so you end up spending like I say sometimes a day on-site and nothing gets delivered or oh hurray the wagon's turned up and the crane breaks down you can't unload the crane then you've got the wagon driver moaning swearing blue murder because he needs to be gone in two hours and what's he gonna do? you've gotta get you've gotta him off gotta get the pipe off somehow
B	yeah yeah
A	well you
B	the crane is er
A	who er
A	yeah the contractor quite often would hire a crane we've hired cranes in the past obviously
A	at our cost
B	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	but you either have erm er a vehicle like a they call them HIAB vehicles which have cranes on the back of them so they can offload them but they're very expensive so you don't just transport pipe generally on HIABs you transport it on flat-back wagons which are cheaper
B	yeah
A	especially with a job like this where you've got loads and loads going in
B	yeah yeah
A	if you've just got four pipes you'd have a HIAB and it would do it all
B	yeah yeah
A	but for this you'd have your flat-backs and they'd go in and you'd have a crane offload vehicle and
B	mm
A	and go
A	so you haven't got to lasso ropes around the end of it
B	right okay
A	and do all that you've just gotta drop the suction pads on and er so they're much quicker but they just break down all the time but a lot of companies now have them
A	especially the big contractors you know er erm
B	right yeah
A	anything after two hours they call it demurrage
B	right
A	and you're into a demurrage charge and they'll charge that by the hour or
B	the transport company?
A	yeah they charge that
B	oh right
A	by the hour or by the half hour
B	cos they're having to wait
A	yeah so er demurrage means waiting time
B	mm
A	so you'd need to clock cos they they go oh you were waiting six hours you're
A	to make sure they're not clocking that up because they they do that all the time
B	yeah yeah
A	you need to get the driver to give you some sort of confirmation as well when he leaves get times
A	because all that helps with all the extra charges cos all those charges come in to us and
B	no no does he pay em then without question?
A	we just of course we do cos it's
A	I question it and say well you know er but because you go back to the site the site there's somebody on the site
A	they don't know they don't care that's not their cost
B	no no no
A	they're not interested in that that's nothing to do with them we're providing the transport we've said that we've agreed the transport we're giving them a delivered cost to site
B	mm
A	so they don't care if the wagon can't get there
A	they don't care if it takes the wagon three days
A	they don't care if the wagon sits there for three days
B	no as long as it's
A	but we
B	delivered on time
A	but we care so those are the sort of things that you have to try if you can to
B	mm
A	watch out for and the best thing is just to be friendly with them
B	mm
A	that's it
B	mm mm sure
A	but it's just a case of getting on with them
A	cos
B	he'd be er
A	oh he's a nightmare
B	telling em they're late or telling them er
A	oh yeah he just gets everybody's back up the minute he walks onto site
A	with his high-vis and his hat and that's it and his Mr MD sign or whatever he is now
A	and just starts shouting the odds and
B	oh yeah
A	I mean people aren't they're not interested these people aren't being paid enough to be interested
B	no
A	in listening to
B	he has a certain lack of tact don't he? in anything he does
A	well if you did this job you'd have to put up with him
A	just gotta let it ride off really
B	mm
A	like I say
B	no
B	mm
A	yes
A	he's never gonna fall out with you over this
B	ah we'll see what he comes up with at the end of end of Feb
A	well er
A	yeah but I I don't see how it's gonna work because it's gonna be like erm
A	it's gonna be eight ten-week contract to get that sort of pipe delivered to site easily
A	it's a four million well four million pounds worth I
B	four a wagon yeah that's what he said to me
A	it's gonna be either a thousand mil or twelve hundred mil pipe
B	right
A	erm I dunno erm it's gonna be a lot hundreds
A	yeah well when you think four pipes on a wagon
B	right
A	there's er yeah
A	fit in with your other work? that's the thing
B	I dunno
A	mm
B	it's er not it's not very er taxing
A	no it isn't very taxing it's boring because you're standing around you've gotta
A	well it won't be taxing do do do doing this
A	because
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	on a delivery sheet and you've gotta makes sure somebody signs that delivery sheet to say those numbers but
A	yeah but what well it what it won't have the numbers on the delivery sheets there's
B	mm
A	so you'll put the date on and the time and you'll write the pipe numbers on
B	right
A	and somebody will sign it but then what er you know what you'll get is
B	right okay
A	I'll show you how they write the one and the seven and the four and the nine
B	mm
A	they're very very similar but if you're not sure
B	no you could er er er going back to this take a picture you could
A	yeah yeah of course if if you're not sure
B	you
B	to sign from the picture er that's what you've had mm and you've no question
A	yeah but you
B	you can just
A	because the the delivery note's the delivery note's you you still wanna write a delivery note
B	yeah yeah
A	okay? so you wanna go erm so if you've got the pipe numbers what so if you've if you've got your delivery note and you write your four pipe numbers your delivery note's got a unique number on it
B	mm
A	okay? and a date so but it's but you'll you'll have several with the same dates but it's got a unique number the delivery note
B	right
A	there's only one with that number on it zero five six two or whatever
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	erm so if you're not sure of them any numbers on it you take a
B	delivery note yeah yeah yeah
A	so and then somebody else can make their mind up what they think of it
B	yes yeah
A	I think I'd just take a photo for your backup to say
B	yes yes mm
A	these are my pipe numbers and and call them all that delivery note number
A	you know delivery note zero five six two pipe one zero five six two
B	mm mm
A	pipe two and just
B	yes yeah
A	take photos like that but you know there's er
B	oh yeah yeah
A	none of them can work the spreadsheet so
B	no no
A	but I used to do that I used to get the delivery notes in from
B	yeah
A	and at the end of every couple of days do a sort where you think woah
B	mm
A	sometimes they don't
B	suppose they'd pay you for what they were supposed to have and that was it
A	yeah er they you know you've
B	but
A	you've signed for four numbers but
A	if somebody else decides to be a jobsworth or if somebody comes in and says like we want cost-cutting what can you do?
B	mm
A	that's what they'll go for
A	they'll go for something like that well hang on you've charged us for this delivery this pipe number on three delivery notes we're paying for it once well
B	mm mm
A	they know they've had four pipes
B	yes yes and
B	no
A	but it's it's that actual number that erm and that that number gets put on when it's made then it gets coated and at a factory probably in I dunno where they're doing the coating if they're doing it in Turkey or Holland and then they write that number back on
B	oh
B	mm mm
A	who maybe is dyslexic
B	well
A	cos he's been told it's this and he's you know so you've got that to deal with then you've got the fact that erm you get another process on it and it gets coated over again and then it's got
A	well it does and then you've got
B	cos then it's
A	er the dirt
B	does that they then write the number on again?
A	they they they write it on with some sort of paint or whatever but you've got somebody er been told er that's this number coming out it goes in as this gets coated so at the other end they're writing the number back on
A	cos it's it's not
B	so I suppose along the way there's lots of
A	it's not it's not a stamp if it was like a big heat stamp in the no problem but it's not it's written on the outside of it and it's coated and it's lined doesn't matter
A	where you put it
A	so you've got you've got so that's erm
B	process that could get erm
A	yeah so it it could be wrong before it
B	wrong
A	before it leaves the continent
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	in which case you've got no chance
A	but the other thing at the end of the day you say to the customer right you ordered you know seven hundred pipes you've got seven hundred pipes
B	you've got seven hundred
A	alright? so
B	yeah
A	there's been crossovers with the numbers due to blah blah blah
B	yeah so what you moaning at?
A	yeah
B	you've got seven hundred
A	yeah
B	paid for seven hundred
A	yeah
B	call it quits
A	yeah so as long as you
A	get a signed delivery note for four pipes
B	yeah that's the that's the main thing
A	you know writing the numbers on is important
B	right yeah
A	and when they're coated so it could be that there's a a particular batch
B	oh yeah?
A	that are all faulty because there was something wrong with the lining machines
A	they weren't lined properly
A	or
A	even when the steel was spun spirally welded they spirally weld the steel on this thing
B	mm mm
A	so it all gets traced back that pipe number traces it back traces the manufacturing process back so if they
B	right
A	have one pipe go wrong or one pipe corrode
B	mm
A	then there should be a
B	you need the number off it
A	they need the number because then they can identify the entire batch that was produced in that process and they
B	right
A	so then they identify possible problems in the pipeline so it is
A	it's so that's why it's important
B	mm
A	cos it gives them the traceability
B	well plus it's erm if they come up with a spurious number well we didn't provide you with that number
A	yeah
B	so where you got that pipe from?
A	yeah yeah
A	well yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it it covers you as well as
A	yeah
B	obviously going back to the
A	yeah
B	manufacturers and saying
A	yeah
A	but it
B	write yeah yeah
A	whereas
B	no no
A	and
B	mm mm sure they do that though
A	they have a a weird way and the ones and the sevens they've always got well it's obvious because the ones they go like a seven
B	mm
A	but they don't put the line through it do they?
B	line through it yeah
A	but but because they make a big thing of it like that it's just
B	they think it's a seven
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but it's a one
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that was the most common one all the time and you'd think well you've had that
A	so it was a bit erm
B	mm good
A	but I think you will be away for a while if you end up doing it
B	well
A	be good money though
A	cos you're
A	he he'd he'd pay you all day you're on-site so if you get to site for eight in the morning and stay till six
A	even though quite often you'll be sitting around with a flask of coffee waiting for a wagon to turn up
B	mm
B	right yeah I don't wanna get involved
A	because if they're yeah if you they think you're
B	mm
A	why is that not sticking?
B	yeah yeah I don't wanna
A	have you pre-heated it to whatever degree? have you
A	you'll have to call
B	yes
A	call your Canusa expert in
A	yes I'm in
B	no signal
A	I'm in Kazakhstan at the moment
A	on the edge of the sea
A	it's all good training
B	good training
B	yes good grounding for you
A	yeah
B	he said he was going on about er I've still erm got in mind
A	he'd love
A	yeah I know I know he'd love it
B	you know and get him to experience out in the the real world and er
A	yeah
B	five years' time I'll see if he's available
A	yeah
B	and get him back
A	come back and do it
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't be surprised I wouldn't say never to it but it
B	I reckon
A	oh yes they're I mean they're they're thick as thieves
A	that pair and they're all old
B	yeah
A	why would they wanna work more than another five years? they'll all be in their sixties by then
B	true
A	I'd go back if
A	be ideal
B	with
A	oh god yeah I mean
B	mm
A	I wonder if
B	right
A	his new one
B	from home is it or something?
A	was it? is that what he said?
A	mm it's a shame this one didn't work out really he's only been there six months hasn't he?
B	mm
B	mm
A	and then suddenly with
A	but getting
B	mm
A	pulled the wool over
B	mm mm
B	oh no
B	mm
A	hospital appointment and they'd drop
B	mm mm
A	and
B	normally no that is true
A	but
B	yes that was the upside
A	well only only after
B	mm
A	oh well no but you can put up with
B	I'm having the last yogurt
A	oh are you? er you go ahead which one is it?
B	it's the lemon
A	mm I was gonna try it if it was coconut I didn't try the coconut one are they nice?
B	no yeah they're quite refreshing
A	I said we got her bagels and yogurts
B	mm
A	I said well go ahead
B	yeah mm
A	she'll be in I said she'll come home tomorrow the first thing she'll go for is a bagel
B	yeah
A	mum I want your cooking
B	well she does erm contribute a little bit towards the food
B	so it's only right
A	that's
A	yeah when she asked me today to make food I says you're joking?
A	said you're going to
B	mm
A	oh dear
A	I just left
A	they were gonna eat something before they came back cos
B	oh I see
A	yes mind you I say six in the morning but it'll be like midday for them won't it? so
B	oh well
A	she'll be hungry perhaps during it but anyway
A	if there was a reason why she doesn't like eating on a plane
B	erm
A	well no
B	I dunno
A	no nor me
B	I think it was just mm
A	I suppose when we used to take them when they were little were they still doing meals as standard on planes then?
B	well quite possibly I dunno I think it's improved er but it wasn't
A	well
B	they always used to be er
A	they're alright but she just gets upset at the smell of anybody eating food on a plane
B	yeah yes
A	drives her a bit mad
B	yeah think they were very nice when we first went
A	anyway
A	in a minute I'm gonna watch that erm Sarah Lancashire programme that was on earlier in the week do you know?
B	Happy Valley thing?
A	yes did you see it?
B	no I saw a
A	have you seen it before?

A	it was mum er this is the second series I haven't seen the first but mum said it was good
B	oh
A	so I recorded it so I'm gonna watch that in a minute
B	okey-dokey
A	don't know if you want to watch it
B	erm
A	no it's erm
B	you you can I'll I'll
A	no and then it's erm
B	I'll watch that
A	later
B	watch that
A	mm
B	yes
A	is that light working in
B	yes
A	what are we gonna do about the light in the dining room
A	what number?
B	the number that erm somebody gave me to say look they know about these varilights and erm
A	oh
B	and erm
A	who gave you that number?
B	erm it was
B	no I think it was erm who's the who's the other electrical people down there?
A	dunno
B	er can't remember what they're called now
A	oh what? down on erm down by
B	yeah N N it begins with a N I think
A	dunno
B	N E something
A	dunno
B	that's right
A	oh
B	yeah yeah
A	oh right okay
B	yeah yeah they erm
A	god we used to use those when I worked for
B	mm
B	he said oh the these the we get our the dimmer light those those from these people you may wanna
A	oh right
B	cos I think er all these
A	they're just salesmen
B	supply em and sell em
A	they're not electricians
B	they just they don't really know much about them
A	mm alright then
B	so I'm gonna ring em
A	well it can't be
B	but they
A	because all ours are under the limit
B	well no no what I'm saying is er because the the value of the bulbs it's because we've got two more bulbs than it can cope with whether they're whatever erm
A	oh
B	wattage they are so I dunno why cos yeah they're under the limit
B	er I presume so but I er
A	they call them different names don't they? trailing dimmer and something else
A	well see if you can find out
B	okey-dokey
A	alright I still think we should just try a new switch
B	well we might have to if they say look you need one of these switches
A	mm alright then
B	might have to
A	well
B	but I don't think it's
A	you haven't paid for them the second one though they gave it to us
B	no they gave it
A	for free oh that's alright then
B	yeah that was
A	well
A	here

A	better job of this than you lot
B	yeah easy
A	I think so mm ah
B	yes
A	well so you don't think erm taking plasters'll be any use er for skiing? you don't think your boots'll rub

B	I think it'll probably
A	well
B	blisters now
A	or the Compeed have we got any of those? like for the for the cushioned ones?
A	is it worth taking stuff like that in case?
B	erm
A	are you taking trunks as well in case you go swimming?

B	yes
A	I said why don't we have three each? oh well we could do
B	yeah
