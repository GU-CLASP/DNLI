A	right
B	oh well I don't usually watch that BBC programme but
A	what programme?
B	um
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so
A	well they give people the chance to sell their products
B	yeah yeah
A	but in a conversational way kind of way so it gets round the er advertising law
B	which is what all chat shows do but they do it in kind of a newsy kind of way
A	yeah but
B	Cos they slip in the news
A	yeah
B	at the
A	there's a word for it isn't there
B	I don't know
A	anyway
B	but um yeah this um this guy with cerebral palsy was on there
A	yeah
B	and bless him
A	so it doesn't sound like Stephen Hawkin
A	oh okay
B	yeah
B	the poshness makes it a bit funnier
A	mm
B	his whole thing
A	yeah
B	and he um he he presses his jokes to and it reads off the jokes and he kind of does a few actions to go with it
B	and about and so he does a lot of jokes
A	ha
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	yeah I think it's really nice
A	oh right
B	and
A	what his material was good? Or it was like a gimmick?
B	yeah I think so
A	oh that's good
B	yeah
B	so Ah I think it's really sweet that
A	yeah
B	yeah somebody can achieve something like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's pretty impressive really isn't it
B	yeah
A	I remember there was a study done on er accents and humour
B	yeah
A	I think they found like the South-East like RP accent was the least funniest
B	mm
A	and they told the same joke in like different accents
B	oh I didn't know that
A	to like a group of people
B	yeah
A	I think it was the Brummie accent that came out top
B	yeah
A	and then
B	well the Northern Northern accents
A	yeah Jordie accent
B	or Irish
A	or Liverpudlian
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah well with him cos it's in a cos you don't expect him to have that kind of voice so it kind of works
A	oh
B	oh he must go past the same time every day
A	oh
B	that's a good experiment actually
A	yeah cos I I hate my accent
B	joke
A	I hate it
B	but we've kind of developed our accents
B	oh
A	that's a peacock
B	well you don't see many peacocks do you
A	no
B	look there it is look
A	is that the female?
B	they've got a nice little little
A	yeah it's nice isn't it
B	thing there
A	ha
B	yeah that's a good experiment
A	yeah
B	if I could remember jokes I'd be able to tell you one of his jokes by I er
B	ah
A	no I'm the same
B	one out of the whole lot
A	nope
B	I can't believe you didn't see him on the TV today
A	well I didn't get up till about well half nine
B	oh mum cooked some good food today
A	yeah
B	I was stuffed
B	like ha oh
A	they were good they were
B	yeah
A	I don't know what happened to the crumpets though
B	oh
A	they were too thick weren't they
B	well I I don't think she cooked them for long enough or she cooked them too high temperature or something like that
A	yeah
B	I think she should have grilled them
A	she fried them?
B	yeah well it gave I don't know it gave her a choice of what to do
A	yeah
B	I I I um I know nothing about making crumpets so
A	no I'd never thought about making crumpets
B	they're they look really hard don't they?
A	yeah
B	well they they obviously are cos mum usually gets most of her cooking right
A	yeah
B	but first try for everything
A	ha
B	but now that they've failed I don't think she's gonna want to cook any more
A	ha
B	she's the crumble expert instead
A	ha
B	ah
A	yeah did you know it's Friday the thirteenth today?
B	yeah I know cos it no cos
A	yeah
B	she was really worried cos she's really superstitious
A	yeah
B	of Friday the thirteenth? Thirteenth?
A	yeah
B	um
A	like there was one like saying Jesus was crucified on the
B	oh
A	Jesus was crucified on the Friday the thirteenth
B	really?
A	I don't know how they would know that
B	yeah yeah
A	you know it all sounds like a load of bollocks to me
B	um what did I think? I though it was something to do with the witches witch craze
A	yeah
B	something to do with the witches
A	I dunno
B	no I have read stories about it but I can't remember them
A	yeah exactly but it each story is different isn't it
B	mm
A	so
B	I was just thinking about
A	yeah
B	number seven was their favourite favourite number in the world
A	yeah it's number sixteen now
B	I used to always tell that
B	and they'd go ah I don't know
A	no I
B	er it might be my lucky number
A	no I always used to er when I was doing that TV news project I made
B	oh yeah and they had Seven News channel
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and I I kept like the government channel like on the flip
B	yeah
A	like on purpose cos every time I put it up er they just listening to the gasps in the class go oh teacher no
A	ah it's funny
B	no
A	it looked like the road between Hanoi and Hai Phong
B	yeah
A	ha
B	yeah
A	and the ticket inspector jumped on the front of the bus like so his like feet were on the bumpers
B	oh no
A	and the driver didn't stop
B	oh no
A	and he went hurtling down the highway for like thirty minutes
A	with this  with this  traffic warden just stuck on the front of it
B	ah
A	before he stopped and got chased by all the the locals
B	oh God
B	oh God
A	yeah they're funny
B	do you think afterwards they were oh actually well done it was quite funny when we reflect upon it
B	like they used to with their
A	yeah
B	patting each other on the back
A	yeah
B	but that was a really good scam
A	yeah but it what surprised me the most
B	ah
A	like they
B	yeah
A	like automatically
B	well they would do because they have to
A	yeah because they show
B	they have to
A	they have to show have to demonstrate it that they're on the police's side
B	yeah
A	even though they're not deep down
B	oh but yeah but they wouldn't want somebody on the back front of a bus
A	yeah
B	that's just too dangerous
A	no
B	that's yeah that's
A	what else did I see?
B	oh I missed that one
A	there was a er a woman in Bolton who er who got dumped over Facebook by her boyfriend
B	yeah
A	and so she ah she drove her car into the bowling alley that he worked in
B	into the bowling alley?
A	yeah
B	like through the wall?
A	yeah and they
B	oh no
A	and she went flying like literally
B	idiot
A	like really fast straight through the front door and smashed it all up
B	idiot
A	into the the kiosk bit where they give out the shoes and stuff
B	ha
A	she could have done yeah
B	what?
A	yeah
B	that's oh God some people
A	psychopath
B	mind you the Vietnamese driver is just as bad
B	but some people they're just crazy
A	ah yeah
A	it's weird isn't it when you get so upset by something that you don't
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	you don't think of any consequences
A	no
B	and just like
A	you just completely lose it don't you
B	mm
A	I don't think I've ever got to that kind of mentality
B	no
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	I think everyone can get er angry
B	I think I've only been really angry like fuming bright red steam out the ears about three times in my life I think
A	yeah
B	I can't even remember the situations
B	yeah and I had a fight with him
A	mm
B	the build up but there was
A	it is the build up yeah
B	like obviously like it builds builds builds builds builds
A	yeah
B	things get said
A	you just erupt
B	yeah yeah
A	huh
B	but it seems so petty but it's just something that tips you over the edge innit
A	yeah
B	but yeah I don't think it's happened to me much
A	ha
B	oh when I used to drive in the city
B	ooh oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's one of those channels you never watch
B	or what is it?
A	I don't know
B	I think it's news
A	but they're promoting it in this village in Belgium
B	what?
A	yeah
B	oh one of those
A	and put it back on the the thing put it in the ambulance
B	oh ah ah
A	and then these two cars came round and it was these guys all dressed in black and they er started having a shoot off with the police
B	what?
B	like with a real gun?
A	well not real guns but it looked real
B	God
A	and then they had like fake injuries as well and fake blood and stuff
B	huh
B	oh my God
A	after the police had disappeared this American football team ran out of nowhere
B	yeah but ah er
A	no no I saw it
B	the whole advert that is the film
A	no it's in the kind of same style as the er that mobile phone that
B	yeah but the whole thing was an advert? Or that actually happened to somebody stood there and pressed a button and it happened to him really?
A	no someone
B	he wasn't an actor?
A	no
B	really? Oh God I'd freak
B	oh that would freak me out so much
A	yeah
B	but it's not he cos he pressed the button so he he might register this is all happening because of this
A	yeah yeah
B	but everybody else who's around there just shopping they wouldn't have a clue what it was about
A	yeah
B	yeah but I
A	ha
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	yeah pretty clever
A	and another story I saw about university
B	where? Where?
A	I dunno it's one of the ones in London
B	right
A	in certain parts
B	right
A	well
B	you don't have to go in the bar
A	yeah
B	they wouldn't sell beer in the coffee shop would they?
A	I dunno
B	oh
A	I dunno it's one of those
B	I don't know about that
A	yeah
B	like over the top crazy
A	I suppose it's okay if there isn't an area like a social area you can go where they don't serve alcohol
B	yeah that's all they need
A	then that's fair enough
B	well yeah they just need a coffee shop that doesn't sell it so
A	yeah
B	but well maybe maybe that was maybe the universities are going over the top
A	I don't know
B	are they selling it in like vending machines
A	no you can't do that here
B	I've seen it in a hotel
A	that wasn't in England
B	oh
A	I don't know
B	that was that no it wasn't
A	I think Korea that had
B	no somewhere recently
A	I remember they
B	yeah that was Korea
A	ah
B	ha
A	well no that's it
B	even though it is  it is  in a bad state at the moment
A	I know
B	it er it that something needs to be done
A	yeah
B	like
A	and have you noticed how those boxes of beer have got a lot smaller as well
B	yeah
A	ah they're gonna end up having those really tiny cans the size of Red Bull
B	yeah yeah
A	selling beer like that
B	well no
A	well parts of Asia
B	mm
A	hmm
B	yeah it is difficult that one
A	mm
B	you don't wanna lose the culture but you've gotta do something about it
A	yeah
B	if they don't wanna be surrounded by it
A	well it's just university in England you associate the the Student's Union
B	yeah
A	with getting drunk really
B	yeah
A	Don't you
B	yeah when mum was at uni  when mum was at uni  you see cos when she was at uni she used to get everything for free yeah
A	yeah
B	she got her  she got her  sheets washed for free
B	she got like they got their dinners for free
A	yeah
B	it was crazy
A	yeah
B	but they used to do it used to volunteer in there to get your drinks free
A	hmm mm
B	and drinking over their wage
A	mm
B	over what a wage would be
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	hmm
B	shame it's not like the old days though like when they were all at uni
B	they'll give you some sheets
B	I wish it was
B	I didn't get one single meal
A	yeah
B	and so
A	it's disgusting isn't it
B	they were like how can that possibly be that
B	no not really because they'd never experienced that kind of thing before
A	well you get a tiny box room
B	but it's not cheap rent at all is it
A	no
B	you pay actually I mean it's a ridiculous amount
A	no
B	if you pay for those tiny little rooms
A	the way they re-marketed it was er oh it's the best way to meet people in your first year
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and then they go off to live with their
A	yeah
B	group of people later
A	yeah well I moved in with people doing their masters
B	oh yeah that was
A	it was pretty awful
B	that wasn't good for you was it
A	so I had to join a couple of clubs to meet people
B	oh that's good
A	but it wasn't easy
B	it made you
A	that's how I met
B	yeah
A	so I guess
B	well that that made you get out and about
A	yeah but you know
B	but yeah it's not
A	I didn't have anyone to go to er didn't have anyone to go to the night clubs with
B	the bar with cos
A	do you know what I mean it was  it was  difficult
B	shall we go down that way?
A	okay
B	mm
A	started making friends
B	then you lived with me
A	mm
B	and we lived with twelve blokes and me
A	yeah
B	that was a bit I was a bit gutted at the time
A	mm
B	but I I just had didn't have any female bonds
A	mm
B	mm
A	Cos I remember trying to sell it to you
B	oh yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	but I enjoyed it
A	mm
B	I mean when the girls moved in the next year I didn't really get on with any of them anyway
A	no
B	er Lou wasn't a girly girl
A	yeah I suppose yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I don't know live with a couple of good girl friends or
A	mm
B	I never
A	yeah you didn't miss much
B	ah I bet you didn't think that at the time
A	well I just got drunk
A	and tried to pull
B	ah
A	yeah
B	everybody puts erm too much pressure on themselves
A	yeah it was the time when you know it was really popular
B	where did you go again? Ibiza?
A	no
B	no
A	I went to Tenerife and
B	mm that's right
A	Benidorm
B	mm
A	and it was the time when all those shows were on TV about the club reps and everything
A	it just wasn't like that
B	and with holidays like that you've just got you've got to drag yourself out in the daytime to sit on the beach haven't you
A	and then feeling sick the next day
B	Cos otherwise you just  you just  flake out and just
A	yeah but when you're not drinking enough water and
B	mm
A	it's too hot
B	mm
A	you know I didn't see any culture or speak to anyone local
B	mm
A	and see anything
A	full of dick heads
B	mm
A	apart from maybe catching Chlamydia or something
B	mm
A	well I dunno really
A	where are these cars coming from?
B	but it does make a erm I think it would make a er a nice group holiday if you got  if you got  the right kind of people all together
A	yeah
B	in like a little cabin and
A	well
B	or one of those cottage holidays we always talked about doing when we lived down in Plymouth
A	yeah
B	remember we said oh yeah let's get everybody together and go and stay in a cottage all together like a group of friends
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	or like a walking holiday
B	yeah a walking holiday
A	well like
B	well we've done walking holidays
A	we've sort of done that
B	yeah
A	they are good
B	apart from cos it was oh I mean oh that was so beautiful
A	yeah
B	and er you know we all had to have a nap in the afternoon
A	well we had to go to bed at about six o'clock as well
B	well
A	with a candle
B	yeah
A	with nothing to eat apart from maybe a pot of noodles
B	oh and they sold those weird fried
A	fried Mars bars?
B	Mars bars
A	did they?
B	yeah but erm
A	where?
B	we and we said when we get to the top we're gonna try one of those
A	I don't know
B	we did and it was disgusting
A	yeah it was disgusting yeah
B	and they get more expensive the closer you get to the top anyway
A	yeah well I'd like to do
B	yeah more expensive and worse quality
A	yeah I like holidays with a challenge in them
B	mm
A	and you get there and you you go yay I did it
B	yeah not just sitting on the beach
A	no it's
B	but snorkelling or
A	yeah
B	or walking hiking
A	I hate sitting on the beach
B	oh I I like erm
A	it's so boring
B	I like a couple of hours on the beach reading my book and
A	A couple of hours maybe yeah and then that's enough for me
B	swimming
A	as long as there's something to do yeah
B	and it's warm enough
A	I'd much rather sit by a lake than
B	we had some good times on a beach though
A	well if there's snorkelling then yeah definitely
B	well we're gonna go and live next to a beach again
A	yeah
B	we keep going and living next to beaches
A	yeah
B	you've gotta ask yourself why
A	well
B	why do we keep ending up in port towns? Harbours?
A	yeah
B	near harbours
A	ha
B	funny innit?
A	yeah
B	I do prefer to be by the sea
A	there was a guy dressed up as a storm trouper
B	what?
A	who walked across Australia
B	really?
A	and
B	why didn't he put it on his back?
A	well I it was too heavy I guess
B	he walked across Australia?
A	yeah
B	whoa
A	yeah it took him I don't know it took him about eight months I think
B	mm
A	it said he was walking for about ten hours a day
B	go on then
A	no I'd love to do something like that
B	A really big challenge
A	but I can't really do it now
B	yeah
A	Cos you haven't got the time
B	when your knees don't go and your
A	yeah and my ligaments are fucked
B	hips pop out
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh dear
A	but I'd yeah something like that I'd love to do
B	maybe we could be those
A	yep
B	like really bulchy not bulchy no like really strong granny and granddad you know going we're gonna go on a trek
B	and walk across all the way around England
B	and just
B	and if your foot lasts
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well it's got better again now
B	yeah
A	yeah well like we were saying yesterday I'd like to do the coast to coast
B	mm
A	I'd like to do Ben Nevis
B	I was gonna buy you one of those um wrist counters for your birthday last year and I couldn't find one
A	A wrist counter?
B	to all the sports shops
A	did you?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	and then you didn't get much for your birthday in the end did you
A	mm mm
B	Cos I  cos I  couldn't find what I wanted and then I ran out of time
A	mm
B	oh
A	mhm
B	well I suppose if you don't get what you want then what's the point of getting what you don't want
A	well exactly I don't really want anything anyway
B	ah
A	it still works
B	yeah
A	yeah that is a problem
B	where did we buy that last fan from? That was from a shop or that actually that should be alright
A	that was just
B	do you want one of those wrist counters one day?
A	what is it?
B	it just it it it clocks how many paces you take
A	er
B	and and and you can time it
A	mm
B	so you go for a jog and like er cos what I thought when we used to go for that little jog around the park and we never could agree on how far it was
B	then
A	doesn't it depend though
B	and yeah
A	does it it what it counts the
B	no it counts
A	is that what it does?
B	oh
A	Cos surely that depends on how big you are
B	oh
A	how big your stride is
B	I don't know how it works
A	yeah
B	maybe you tie it round your ankle
A	it's like a pedometer kind of thing?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	no I don't know if I would want one of them anyway
B	well I think they're good
A	so
B	what? Can you tie that to your wrist? GPS watch or something?
A	no they
B	mm
A	and it's got a map on it
B	mm
A	it's got them all programmed in
B	mm
A	they come to a scale of like one to fifty but you can then buy better ones like one to twenty-five which I think is the proper like Ordnance Survey thing
B	mm
A	you know where you can see the footpaths and everything
B	yeah I think wait a few years
A	oh yeah there's still lots of problems with it
B	because they can't even make those things to go in the car right
A	yeah
B	yet
A	and also it does kind of take away from the romance of it as well
B	mm
A	just like walking off into the countryside
B	I used to love having like you used to have your map in your plastic bag didn't we
A	yeah
B	and then you get it out
A	that's what I mean
B	and you have a little argument about where you are and
A	yeah
B	and which direction you're gonna go
A	it's all part of it isn't it
B	yeah
A	not having a little a bit of plastic that's
B	if you haven't got that kind of orientation thing
A	mm
B	like all you have to do is walk
A	yeah
B	mm
A	in the middle of somewhere
A	or the satellite goes down
B	mm
A	so you've still gotta have the map anyway
B	mm
A	yeah I love maps
B	but one thing is we usually get somewhere and we say we look at the maps and go well we need one of those
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	and then we get really lost
B	but they're they're expensive cos they took such a they took a long time to make those maps surely
A	yeah but once they're made that's it
B	yeah but
A	it's quite clever isn't it really
B	very clever very
A	all the contours and everything
B	yeah but now they've got like the the stuff from the satellites they can
A	yeah but you can't
B	they can judge them
A	you can't gage the er the height though can you?
B	er
A	on a satellite image
B	I suppose somebody has to walk it or drive it and
A	I don't know how they would do it
B	and measure it and
A	yeah
B	well yeah cos you get those things that you set at sea level don't you
A	yeah an altimeter
B	and then somehow
A	yeah well that's another good thing about those GPS things
B	mm
A	which is good if you're climbing a mountain or something
B	yeah it's good if you know you
A	you have to go back down a hundred metres or
B	yeah
A	before you go to sleep
B	yeah
A	that's good
B	or you're like those crazy blokes who those big rugby blokes that
A	oh yeah
B	what was that place called?
A	I dunno
B	those big rugby blokes
A	no it was about four thousand
B	was it four? I don't know
A	yeah
B	of of you
A	I think the threshold's about two and a half thousand I think
B	oh is it?
A	that's when you can start feeling altitude sickness
B	but it was the highest
A	no
B	not any more
A	no
B	with electricity?
A	no it wasn't that one
B	oh
A	another one
B	oh and they went oh we're alright
A	idiots
B	running up and down the hills having the time of their lives
B	or big big baulky goats cos they had all those muscles didn't they
B	and then they
A	like yeah
B	I was really worried
A	they did look fucked
B	one of them couldn't breath at all
A	no
B	he was going ah huh ah huh
A	they were idiots
B	I know
A	well they were
B	they they went home as well
A	oh yeah
B	they were going to do the same route as us and go all the way round and they had to go home
A	no they just fucked themselves up
B	yeah
A	er
B	hmm
A	right so tomorrow because this bloody game isn't on BBC or ITV
B	ah
A	erm shall I phone the pub in Barnham Broom?
B	I think phone
A	and see if they've got ESPN or
B	I think it'd be better for us to walk to Barnham Broom and watch it rather than
A	but er
B	I dunno rather than
A	well I'll have to phone them up but from what I remember of that pub they've only got like a TV in one of those mounted brackets in the top corner of the room
B	no no they had a big screen
A	I don't think so
B	well phone them up
A	do you know what I mean? I don't wanna go there if people are having their their Sunday lunches
B	it's Saturday
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	no
B	but I don't know
A	well that's why I was thinking maybe Dereham's better
B	er
A	it might have more of a sporty kind of bar with a big screen TV
B	you've gotta get there
A	although Dereham's not really like that either is it
B	no
A	yeah it'll take an hour to get there
B	you're best off going into the city but
A	then we'll have to
B	yeah if not phone  if not phone  phone the social club and say
A	no
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah but they have always been fairly nice to us
A	yeah they have done yeah but I feel guilty
B	oh
A	and I wanna watch the game in relative comfort
B	yeah
A	not
B	yeah
A	looking over my shoulder
B	but it was friendlier than the other pub when I know we haven't been in there for a year but like when when we were sitting there
A	what other pub?
B	everybody would say hello as they walked in
A	yeah
B	so they were quite friendly
A	yeah they were yeah
B	like they would walk in and go hello
A	yeah
B	goodnight
A	yeah
B	and even though we kept ourselves to ourselves for most of the night
A	yeah a bit local
B	alright? Do you wanna
A	yeah
B	so it looks like there's people in here
A	ha
