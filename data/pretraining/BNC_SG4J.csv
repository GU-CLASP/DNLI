A	where's what?
B	ah I just walked past one of those um bird tables that we bought your dad
A	yeah
B	remember when we were sitting in his garden
A	no it was in his garden
B	it wasn't there
A	it wasn't a table I bought
B	it wasn't there was it?
A	like a little bird house
B	oh I thought
A	and they they'd hung it on their trellis
B	really? I thought they'd throw it away
A	but I asked him if he had um if any birds had gone in it and he said no
B	oh
A	but I didn't say anything cos I had a look around and there was nowhere else to put it
B	oh I didn't  I didn't  see it
A	yeah it was there
B	I was looking
A	look there's another hot air balloon up there
B	where?
A	er it's by the other one
B	oh I've lost the other one now as well
A	there's one over there
B	I can't see it at all
A	huh
B	no
A	no? hmm
B	yeah they're always around here
A	er
B	if yeah
A	yeah
B	and I saw running when all of the other neighbours running to go and see the hot air balloon
A	that must have crashed quite badly then
B	yeah well it just fell down didn't it? Er I dunno
A	what it fell out of the sky?
B	no it just kind of came down gradually at a
A	right
B	A steady speed but you know it wasn't supposed to be going that fast into the ground
A	yeah
B	and we were all round to see what it was like and I'm pretty sure they all told me to go away
B	that's all I can remember
A	well if they're still getting
B	no no no it'd stopped
A	right
B	he was just like what are you? What are you all doing around here? Go away
A	yeah
B	ultimately the reason that we went was to check that everybody was okay
A	is it?
B	he just thought we were all
A	gawk
B	yeah we used to say that
A	I thought it was gawp
B	oh it is gawp
A	what's a gawk?
B	or it can be a gawk
A	sounds like a some alien from er
B	it can be gawk or gawp
A	the planet Zog
B	it can be gawk or gawp depending on er how strongly you're doing it
A	it's a weird word isn't it
B	yeah
A	gawp
B	Cos you
A	yeah
B	but we used to call them all gawpers
B	yeah
A	that's a good word
B	gawper
A	yeah
B	it's quite funny
A	so have you ever been in a hot air balloon?
B	no
A	no I could have done once but they had it over the like the local playing field
B	mm
A	and it was just some fete where it was tied to the ground and just and it went up like a hundred foot
B	mm
A	stayed there and then just came back down again
B	mm
A	and it didn't really seem
B	I've seen like that one in
A	er there's the that thing in er Bournemouth
B	ah
A	it goes up doesn't it

A	it's like oh my God it's gonna go and eat someone
A	killer
B	come here
A	killer come here
B	oh God
A	God
B	why? Cos of the owners?
A	well yeah
B	not being able to control them
A	yeah I know
B	and
A	see that to me doesn't sound like fun
B	yeah and it gets so repetitive
A	yeah
B	it's got a weight problem or something
A	well
B	it's got like a gland problem
A	that's what they all say isn't it?
B	no this one had he had to have an operation on his er tummy
A	what did he have erm stomach staples?
B	no
A	well they should stop feeding it bacon
B	they're not feeding it
A	mm
B	where you're just calling and calling and shouting the dog
A	yeah cos you're not having a nice walk in the countryside are you?
B	and then they're running up and down
A	yeah
B	and the dog's having a whale of a time
A	yeah yeah he's having a brilliant time
B	he's up he's loving it
A	yeah
B	and he doesn't care about his owner
A	jumping in the puddles
B	yeah
A	killing all the killing all the wildlife
B	well yeah
A	ah let's get a dog
B	it can come round ours and kill all those rabbits in the garden
A	yeah
B	I can't believe they killed those squirrels yesterday
A	well they had to kill them
B	but I was saying why like if they chopped the tree down and the squirrels nest was there
A	yeah
B	yeah the mum squirrel runs away and there's the baby squirrels sitting there
A	yeah
B	wouldn't if they left all the baby squirrels there in
A	erm a dray
B	A dray
A	is it this way?
B	ah right
A	right hang on
B	oh no I've forgotten
B	yeah it must be this way
A	I dunno
B	oh I must learn my roads
A	the wibbly wobbly road is that what it's called?
B	oh see we should go for more walks and learn my way around again
A	hello partridge
B	is that a partridge?
A	or is it a pheasant?
B	no I thought it was one of Grouse Grouse
A	grouse?
B	dunno
A	oh I don't know
B	anyway what was I saying? Yeah wouldn't if they left the baby squirrels there and the tree was down wouldn't the mum squirrel come back and get them?
A	well I dunno
B	wouldn't it come back and get them?
A	didn't? How big were the babies?
B	little babies
A	well how big?
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	really?
A	if they had to bash them over the head then then
B	do they?
A	they wouldn't have killed them if they didn't have to
B	yeah
A	they wouldn't have gone oh let's kill some squirrels for fun
B	no
A	would they?
B	no no they wouldn't
A	so?
B	it's just a bit weird when they all come in for a cup of tea
A	yeah
B	it's like well why did you have to kill the squirrels? I know the tree and the home is wrecked but
A	yeah I didn't understand why they had to rub the blood in their face and and put the
B	ha ha ha ha
A	and they were wearing those little teeth as necklaces
B	yep
A	well Zumba squirrels
B	how did Zumba get to squirrels?
A	I dunno
B	dancing squirrels?
A	I don't know both are quite good scores on the Scrabble
B	I was talking about that woman
A	I suppose
B	yeah they are
A	yeah I know it is
B	you are prepared?
A	well prepared
B	I dunno
A	yeah if it gets dark we're a bit screwed aren't we?
B	we'll have to phone mum and dad to come and get us
A	yeah
B	like this walk just clears your mind doesn't it? I mean
A	yeah and this day is beautiful
B	oh this is wonderful
A	where?
B	isn't that one there? There
A	oh yeah
B	kind of bluey
A	no we just walked around a corner
B	oh
A	on the wibbly wobbly road or whatever you call it
B	this is the road to
A	mm
B	are you taking the piss out of me? And my road knowledge?
A	no it's just you
B	mm
A	have you got no comment for that?
B	no
A	huh
B	no these are massive what?
A	these are big like connecting ones between big towns
B	they are pretty massive aren't they?
A	yeah they're huge
B	well aren't they all that size?
A	I mean my my ears never ring
B	no that's not true cos in Wales when we were up the top of the hill no other power cables about apart from going to that little cottage and my ears were ringing
A	yeah
B	so
A	well
B	but I know it is it has been bad here
A	hmm
B	it's getting really stupid
A	yeah well they finished doing whatever they were doing to them cos before we came they had all those nets under them didn't they
B	oh what were they doing? I've forgotten
A	repair work with them weren't they
B	I do feel really dizzy when I'm here
A	yeah
B	like I don't feel
A	you feel dizzy because you're standing under one of these
B	oh
A	seriously they're really bad for you
B	well there's not a lot of place
A	as well they've done studies to show that people who live under these things are so much more likely to get like brain cancer and
B	under it or near it?
A	well
B	I mean really if it's like half a mile
A	I don't know what the um
B	oh I do feel a bit dizzy
A	yeah
B	is that just cos I'm looking up at it?
A	maybe
B	no I I do
A	I'm sure they had to make it bigger than it was
B	mm
A	I mean think about all the electromagnetic force
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just electricity?
A	yeah
B	why can't they put them underground? I just don't understand
A	underground?
B	it looks like it's falling down
A	you can't put them underground
B	those wires look like they're all falling down
A	ha
B	I don't wanna
A	can you imagine how difficult it would be fixing them if it was all underground? How expensive it would be and ground
B	yeah but like they put them in in the massive cables that they can put those massive cable casing on it so it's very unlikely that there's gonna be a problem with the wire
A	er
B	er it makes you dizzy doesn't it?
A	it does yeah
B	that would make
A	oh
B	oh
A	dunno it's a good
B	Cos that's quite a weird illusion
A	yeah
B	let's get through here
A	can you here those guns going off?
B	we could jog to
A	shooting the pheasants again
B	yeah
A	I thought pheasant or shooting season was over
B	why would it be over?
A	I thought oh I dunno
B	ooh yay
A	it is a little bit
B	well no you've got your car to protect you
A	quite daunting aren't they?
B	yeah
A	what would we do without them though?
B	well we wouldn't have any electric would we
A	yeah that would suck
B	now then here's another road look
A	right all all the people have disappeared now That's good
B	no
B	ooh
A	oh bloody hell
B	quite scary
A	oh Jesus
B	why is there a road? Oh
B	why does that road go to
A	right
B	well I do because I'm trying to work out my directions
A	well it says
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so why would we're walking the opposite way
B	well we are now
A	huh
B	yeah it's lovely actually
A	yeah well we should do it again
B	yeah
A	probably get in there and it's gonna be a right local pub isn't it?
B	no
A	ah what do you want? Remember that pub we went into in
B	yeah I know they were
A	went in there
B	we're closed
A	we're closed
B	they were drinking their pints
A	well okay
B	yeah
A	we're closed what do you want?
B	oh that was horrible wasn't it?
A	we only wanted to ask for directions as well
B	yeah so unwelcoming
A	oh God that was a nightmare day that was
B	and we were like didn't we say what about those guys drinking?
A	yeah
B	and they were like they're now going
A	bastards
B	well you never know maybe they were closing for like a late lunch or something
A	yeah but there's a way to say it isn't there?
B	well they're not yeah with that that big group of people laughing at us
A	you don't need to bark at someone
B	all looking us up and down
A	well we did probably look a state
B	yeah yeah well we were lost we were
A	with a tent on our back
B	we were really lost do you remember? Really really lost
A	yeah well we didn't that was ridiculous we didn't even have a proper map
B	mm
A	we had that stupid map that came free on the back of a leaflet and we were trying to walk across a twenty miles across some fields
B	mm that was terrible how naive
A	we thought yeah that'd be alright
B	yeah we can get across
A	yeah well luckily we met that ranger who said oh let's have a look at your map
B	we did have we did have some stuff
A	he took one look at it
B	yeah and yeah and then he was just like stupid townspeople
A	yeah whatever just keep walking that way
B	stupid townspeople it's your own fault for getting lost
A	and and so it was really
B	and then my bag my backpack broke that trip
A	yeah that was the same day
B	and I was carrying it on the front
A	yeah
B	my whole backpack with the tent and stuff
A	yeah
B	we were sharing the tent weren't we?
A	yeah
B	oh God that was a nightmare
A	and that dog attacked us
B	oh God yeah
A	and then we got then we got to the campsite
B	and that we
A	it was
B	it was on the campsite
A	oh yeah
B	it was on the campsite and you used it to bash in the tent pegs
A	then I threw it in the bush and then their caravan turned up and said where's our number plate?
B	you're on the only flat bit of land move your tent
A	you know he was revving his engine wasn't he? with his
B	yeah
A	he turned his he put them on main beam and revving his engine
B	and we were knackered weren't we?
A	no
B	we were like there's no way we're moving our tent now
A	yeah well I didn't know
B	I don't even know if that's true
A	no
B	God what arseholes for shining their lights in all night
A	mm
B	and then we started laughing about it all
A	yeah
B	we were really hurting
A	well we were I think we were on breaking point
B	well we were yeah half way between
A	and they just I think they were probably scared actually
B	sort of that hysterical are you going to just laugh or are you going to cry?
A	yeah
B	yeah they turned them off in the end didn't they? Oh God what arseholes though they
A	well
B	they thought we were like we were the horrible people
A	we poached their land?
B	yeah
A	and threw their number plate in
B	in the bush
A	in anger in the bush
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	attacked by dogs
A	I think it was more than that
B	Cos we started really early in the morning and we didn't get there till really late
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and a broken bag
B	oh God
A	yeah
B	we haven't been lost in a while
A	I don't see how this hiking lark is er it's not the most relaxing kind of holiday though is it? It's supposed to be some peaceful retreat
B	that's because you make it adventurous and dangerous by not taking a map or not calculating distances or not worrying about wild animals in the bushes or something
A	when have I ever done that?
B	you've gotta be prepared with your girl guide thing and your compass
A	yeah
B	I think it was ever since that trip actually ever since that trip I always took a compass with me
A	mm
B	and then even when I got lost in the towns I used to get my compass out
A	very good
B	I remember well who was that that was there when I took my compass out in the middle of town? Cos that cos it was after that trip that I just kept it in my bag the whole all of the time because
A	yeah you should always have a compass on you
B	well I don't know you can usually tell
A	well it depends on what you do I suppose
B	you can usually tell where the sun is can't you? At night I find it a bit harder because I know some stars are like those planets and stuff some of them you know
A	yeah
B	but that depends on the time of year
A	yeah exactly it'd be alright if they didn't move
B	well at the moment you know they've got those er what is it Venus in the east or something I think
A	they're all in the sky at the moment
B	and then
A	Saturn you can even see
B	and it's Saturn that's on the west
A	Mars
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	something like that
A	yeah
B	so how are you supposed to remember?
A	I don't know
B	so compass is better
A	yeah well I think we need a compass more than most people cos we're always
B	getting lost?
A	er well that
B	yeah
A	I mean we're always going off and doing seeing different places
B	yeah
A	and have to walk twenty plus miles before we can have a drink
B	here you go
A	is this
B	yeah but
A	well that wasn't very far
B	no
A	I thought we'd be walking for hours
B	but we've got to cross the we've got to cross the bridge yet and then go
A	the bridge
B	go through the town
A	right
B	so see over there
A	this isn't
B	yeah it's the same difference
A	what the village has got two names?
B	no it's just this little bit just before the other village
A	well we're not in the other village then are we?
B	we're near enough
A	God
B	oh well it's all part of the same bit
A	tell me again when we get to the village
B	oh okay
A	I'm excited we're in
B	there's a nice little piece of woodland
A	yeah
B	isn't it?
A	it is nice quite nice
B	yeah I'd like that plot nice little piece of land
A	do you think it's for sale?
B	yeah but we said
A	what would you do with woodland though? I mean you couldn't do anything with it
B	no
A	it's a nice romantic idea
B	well I'd like um on my land one day in the future I'd like um
A	well I think we need a house first
B	yeah well I'd like a
A	well we need a job first
B	yeah well and then a piece of land
A	yeah
B	you know you put the house on after
A	A river?
B	A river or a lake
A	A river or a lake okay
B	yeah er not that fussy you see I can be flexible
A	yeah
B	A river or a lake
A	trees
B	well so that we can chop down trees and rebuild trees
A	so you're gonna have a proper fireplace then
B	so that we can have a proper fireplace yeah
A	mm
B	so so that we can keep up to date with the fire and the logs
A	yeah
B	you know cos if you want to live off the land as much as you can then you need that don't you? You need a few trees
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah I'd love that
A	that's good that is
B	they've done that
A	er has that ever broken?
B	mm
A	no that was the chimney
B	well yeah the chimney flute
A	well I don't know I was just wondering if it's  if it's  something you have to regularly maintain or once you've got it set up it just runs itself
B	I nearly crashed here
A	yeah
B	yeah I think it was this bend
A	well it depends how fast you're going I suppose
B	oh
A	Norfolk in general is not a very bad place to crash because there's no hills
B	yeah but still it depends if you roll over what else you hit and all sorts of things
A	yeah
B	they're still reliant on so they're still reliant on so much from society
A	well yeah oh God it takes a hell of a lot to cut yourself off
B	you can't can you? You can't
A	it's virtually impossible
B	and and because you want to live this life of you know I'll do you a favour
A	yeah
B	which is kind of what they've got around here but I don't know
A	yeah not
B	not too much but there is a little bit of it
A	only within their small circle of friends
B	they have here's my walnuts
A	and well a couple of local farmers
B	yeah
A	but that's I don't know
B	yeah
A	I think because so many people have moved in from er London and that I think that kind of thing is going to disappear
B	what they haven't got as many skills as the older people?
A	no
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it should do
B	that's why you you
A	but I don't think it's gonna be promoted though because that's not what the government wants
B	no
A	they want people to buy shit
B	but I think the main thing for us is to find a nice
A	yeah
B	because you don't want a house where you're neighbours are all nobody talks to each other or something like that
A	yeah
B	nobody makes each other the odd bit of jam at Christmas or something
A	yeah
B	I don't know
B	yeah
A	oh
B	no it's a bit busy innit?
A	Cos they come flying around that corner don't they?
B	yeah they do cos they like the bends
A	hiya
B	they like the bends
A	yeah it's okay until you get someone like us
B	walking along
A	walking in the middle of the road
B	yeah
A	right
B	ah see that's the church that we haven't been to see
A	yeah
B	and there's no
A	is that a bus stop?
B	no that's not a real bus stop
A	I dunno what does it say?
B	no it's not real
A	it's not real?
A	oh
B	it goes from
A	you're really screwed aren't you if you don't drive?
B	yeah
A	and the you have to pay I don't know about six quid to go down the road
B	mm
A	go to any other country and that's the way poor people move about
B	yeah there'd be even though this is the middle of the country side there'd be
A	well in the countryside people who have pick ups and they'd just stop where you'd be able to jump on the back
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	whereas here cos they've got all the machines they don't need people working on the farms do they? So they haven't got anybody
A	yeah
B	oh God
A	what?
B	so well when is this land coming up to auction? Cos the land that they want to buy that's coming up to auction
A	what?
B	I was like why are you getting a loan now? Why don't you?
A	why do they need a loan?
B	well to buy this land that they wanna buy
A	oh God
B	ah
A	and they were allowed to get a loan? I thought
B	no and because her credit rating is quite high because er you know they didn't er they borrowed money before or they haven't had work in England for a while
A	yeah
B	their credit rating is quite low
A	what?
B	I mean that
A	well yeah
B	and a lot of it got taken up when the cat was sick and they when they moved all their stuff back on the boat
A	mm mm
B	like to get all their stuff back on the boat
A	hmm
B	but er yeah they're doing that but
A	ten grand? What interest rate is it?
B	ten grand
A	that's gotta be pretty damn high
B	I though I mean I mean they've got loans before but that's irrelevant because now how they do it with the loans now is like all of the high interest rates they just get you
A	yeah
B	and it's just a payment every month
A	well it's just a
B	but she's tying herself down to British society
A	loans are for suckers aren't they? I mean
B	yeah and I'd
A	I thought people had woken up to that in general
B	yeah me too
A	I thought them especially would stay
B	them especially
A	take a grand loan
B	I didn't think it would
A	Cos they'll be paying back like fifteen grand at least
B	yep
A	well
B	even
A	huh
B	yeah
A	oh they gave me all this money
B	Cos if they
A	oh great
B	can you see it? But oh can you believe it? What are we gonna say to them? Because I really disagree and I think they should get
A	well it's their choice
B	yeah but I don't want them to get in a muddle
A	well
B	can you imagine if we come back next time and they're all in a muddle
A	mm it does seem a bit foolish I have to say
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah yeah
A	where the the interest rates are a lot lower than the bank
B	ah you see we should have told them about that
A	and then you can choose to pay it back over one two or three years or something
B	yeah
A	and it's literally the interest rates are half of that of the bank
B	are we still gonna do that?
A	no cos I thought with the economy about to crash then
B	it wouldn't be any good?
A	you wouldn't get your er money back
B	ah
A	but I like the idea of cutting out the banks and all of these loan sharks
B	well they've got two weeks to go back on the loan
A	and doing it person to person
B	well I think I'll tell her about that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like in your in your village
B	mm I hope they'll be alright
A	that'd be nice to do
B	it would be
A	Cos that's that's what
B	but that's how a bank started isn't it? And then they just get power hungry and just like
A	yeah
B	yes
A	they look after the family
B	yep yep
A	um I don't know if they charge interest on
B	not that much
B	up
A	you know but even if they do and they charge a lot less than the the best rates out there then you know that's how they they build their families up
B	mm
A	no
B	they've got some family that will help them
A	but Ray's been working every day hasn't he for the last?
B	yeah
A	I mean he's he'a getting pretty decent money isn't he?
B	yeah
A	so why do they need?
B	well they said they were saving some money now
A	I mean a deposit for this land they're looking at is what? Thirty grand was it the guide price?
B	that's the problem
A	whir er
B	that's a funny jeep
A	yeah
B	yeah it could go to fifty
A	and they still they still haven't been to the planning offices or or spoken to anyone about what they can actually do with this land
B	yeah
A	I mean if it's just a er a flood plane what are they gonna do with it? If they buy it?
B	well
A	I mean it it would be nice to own a little bit of land and it generally goes up doesn't it?
B	well I'm just hoping it'll be alright for them cos they have been working
A	yeah I know he is
B	but he's having to go he just gets home and goes to bed
A	yeah
B	and then he goes to work
A	yeah
B	he's trying to get that other job which is less money but more security
A	yeah
B	yep
A	this is yeah this is the bridge
B	the bridge that that takes you to the pub
A	to the other side?
B	yeah
A	are there any trolls on this bridge?
B	it's difficult to see when you're driving over this bridge
A	what if there's any trolls?
B	no
A	he looks a bit like a troll
B	no
A	that is a nice little river
B	I don't even know what the river is called
A	er
B	I suppose it's called
A	no
A	the mill?
B	mm
A	well it used to be full of mills didn't it?
B	well not full of them
A	well there used to be mills all over
B	yeah well some of them are converted into houses now aren't they?
A	that looks like it might be an old mill building look down there
