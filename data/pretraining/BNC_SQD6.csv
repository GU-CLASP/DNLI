E	there's no point going to
C	yes
E	and
C	no
A	no
E	but it's too far up according to
D	mm
D	mm and me I always thought
C	that's because we're on the skew
A	yeah
D	I always thought that was going up to
C	we're like that
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	weird yeah
D	I always yeah
C	that's because you always see the the map straight
A	yeah
C	but we're not straight
A	hmm
C	on the  on the  what do they call it? The the where where where where the
D	it's got nothing to do with that either though has it
C	that has because you're you're on the lateral
A	yeah
C	longitude is that way
A	yeah
C	we're on the latitude
E	mm
D	oh right
C	if you look on it

E	she couldn't get out of bed
A	no
D	that was last night though wasn't it?
A	yeah
D	you haven't heard any more?
A	no
D	she
E	she's not very well I don't think
D	no I know she's not very well
A	mm
E	we'll phone her up again at seven
D	yeah
A	well I don't know cos then I'll be on the phone for the next three hours
E	well we have to phone her up
A	well they know we're coming
E	no we should speak to her
A	well I've got lots of other stuff to do as well
C	and there's football tonight
A	is there?
C	Manchester United
E	well let's just text her then
A	yeah I'll text her
C	isn't there
D	I don't know
C	yes you do
D	oh yeah
C	and I said I can't watch Masterchef because football is on
D	but you can because it's finished then
C	and you can because that start at five o'clock
A	so is it Man U? What time is the United game?
C	I think that's around from five o'clock
A	oh blimey
C	that finish before nine anyway
D	mm
C	we did look
A	mm
D	I wondered what that was
C	hmm?
D	what's that then?
C	what have you done?
D	I don't know
E	ah
D	weird innit?
C	it is weird
D	hmm mm
C	that's a varicose vein
D	hmm
A	so where do you wanna go and practise in the car?
E	just round the block
D	yeah just so that you know how to drive that that particular car
A	you'll have to practise all five gears
C	eighty?
C	there's no roads around here that'll take eighty
A	God when you walk
D	what's nice is I mean you do actually when you start off you do just a normal sort of run don't you? I mean it's just you just keep going
A	yeah
E	mm
D	yeah
A	we walked
C	yeah
A	this car came past
C	I know they're lairy
A	he didn't slow down for us
D	mm
C	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah probably
D	mm
C	Cos when when they had the the road closed through
D	and
C	and
A	hmm
C	and that down
D	you know
C	there was
E	mm
C	no
E	there's been accidents
A	which one's that?
C	that's that's the one just down the road there
E	by the social club
C	to
D	mm
C	we walked the footpath and and across
E	yeah when you walk the footpath across the fields
A	mm
E	usually then we come in some point along this road
D	yeah you come into
A	right okay
D	mm
C	and when when they had the diversions through there there were so many accidents
A	huh
C	Cos they think they can still drive as fast along a country lane as they can
A	yeah
D	and there's hardly any
A	mm
D	one car
A	yeah
D	so you've gotta think ahead all the time
E	yeah I know
D	mm
E	that's why I don't
D	yeah
E	but you just can't tell what other people are gonna do
C	apparently there's more accidents on the country on the rural roads than on motorways
D	we think the motorways it's space isn't it?
C	more serious accidents
D	and I I I always think well keep in the the inside lane all the time
C	yeah
D	unless you've got the unless you've got tons of room to pass like erm caravans and stuff
A	mm
D	you're safe there
C	well normally in the on the inside lane anyway they're doing at least sixty most of them
D	they are aren't they
C	but sometimes you come across a very slow moving lorry or caravan and you can pull out nicely and overtake them
A	mm
D	yeah
C	but to stay in the centre lane you have to do seventy
E	yeah
D	mm
C	some of them as you  as you  pull alongside or a lorry pass you it it you can actually feel it drawing you in like that
E	yeah
C	you know?
A	mm
E	yeah we've passed a
A	no you don't like lorries do you?
E	no
C	no
D	mm
A	you got good at the end though
E	Cos you do you feel that there's something to do with the wind next to the lorry
D	mm
C	yeah
E	and it does something to the car
C	yeah
E	and I don't think you can feel controlled if there's some outside force
D	mm
E	somewhere
C	well you when you've got a forty ton lorry travelling at around about seventy mile an hour
A	hmm
C	coming past
A	hmm
E	I mean cos it's so high
C	and when you  when you  hit it
A	mm
C	that buff at you like like a plane in the
A	mm
C	in the  in the
E	yeah turbulence yeah
A	turbulence
C	yeah turbulence that's what it is
E	and that's when people
D	mm
E	I don't know
D	I think take take it like little short journeys
C	take it easy yeah
D	you know and just go at your own pace
E	right what time did you say
D	mm
C	yeah
E	Will she be able to do that?
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah she did it for us
C	she'll tell you where the she puts them
D	mm
A	where did you park? In the car park?
C	in the car park
D	yeah
C	yeah that's not a problem there
E	up the top?
D	it's only it's ten pence an hour
E	mm
D	er free after five I think
C	free after five o'clock
A	that's alright
D	I
C	yeah
A	cor that's good innit
D	well it might have done but it was
A	yeah
D	and
C	that's ten P an hour
A	that's brilliant
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah and free on a Sunday
D	so if you make sure you're there before
E	before nine?
D	well you don't have to pay then do you
E	right but do you pay before or do you pay after?
C	you have to pay then
D	well it says you pay pay and display
A	before
C	I mean that's pay and display
D	mm
A	hmm mm
E	and if we
C	you have to run down and pay
E	if we leave it overnight
D	you have to go down and put a bit of money on at nine
C	you have to go and pay
E	oh what?
C	at nine o'clock yep
D	well that's not
C	that's okay
D	it's not that far away
A	no
E	okay
D	you've only got to put your money on and then come back again
C	and then get back to bed
E	depends what
D	well we usually say well that's it we're leaving then
E	see that's what we've got to plan
