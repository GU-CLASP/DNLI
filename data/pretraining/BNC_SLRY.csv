B	yeah your dad reminds me of my mum when it comes to presents because he's she's so specific and if she doesn't like something she's just be like mm
A	well that's just like my mum
A	but my dad
B	yeah my mum's like that I don't want anything or need anything but I'm like but I have to get you something
A	and like my mum's easy to get cos she just hints so much but it's not even like a subtle hint it's like oh for Christmas I'd really like a guitar
A	ah for Christmas a great idea is a blah blah yes we get the idea
A	yeah that's like my mum
B	and I can't so
A	and like if it's the wrong material and it itches or
B	oh my gosh yeah
A	labels
B	every time my mum goes to look in a shop she's like right what's in this? cos I have to and then she gets
A	if there's a trace of wool
B	yeah
A	my mum can't can't get it
B	my mum's like ninety percent acrylic oh there's some elastine in that can't get that then she's like that might be a bit itchy I'll leave that
B	but mum was looking at jumpers I just need to check all the labels and I was like okay alright but I like it
A	yeah it the school but school
B	comfortable
A	yeah
B	and they're not
A	and they're not woolly and itchy or
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	everyone else just wears jumpers and so I when turned up to
A	or a tie or something
A	yeah we can't wear ties
B	no
A	and blazers
B	I feel sorry for
A	yeah
B	their uniform their blazers
A	like red and black stripy
B	oh my gosh that's ridiculous I feel so sorry for them
A	yeah so do I
B	because
A	cos they have ties and blazers and it's like
B	blazers and they're both ridiculous
A	like bright colours
B	yeah
A	and it's like really
B	I'd actually way prefer I actually prefer school uniform to wearing normal clothes
A	so do I because it's really hard to find something to wear
B	yeah
A	and then you don't wanna wear the same thing so many times cos I basically just wear my jeans the whole time
B	yeah
A	and that's basically it and then
B	and then I never know what to wear on a non uniform day so how am I meant to figure out what to wear every day?
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	mm
B	because I don't like how we have to or I don't mind I I don't like how we're not allowed to have sort of stretchy material skirts like I'd like the sort of stretchier ones not like the really tight fitting ones but you know like my black and white one
A	oh yeah
B	like that
A	you I thought you can like
B	yeah but you're not allowed them
A	oh
B	technically I don't think
A	well
B	yeah well
A	but it's like a belt
B	a belt like a big belt
A	yeah
B	in fact it's probably not even a belt
A	well it's very revealing
B	it's an extension of her top
B	exactly I really like I actually really like the wind band tops I like them because it's the size that
A	I don't like the colour it's grey
B	mm
A	I mean it's okay
B	you and
A	hopefully in the summer they won't be as big
B	hopefully they will I like them big and I like them with the collar done up and like really massive and baggy that's how I like it that's how I like everything
A	I like fitted jumpers like more not
B	ah just like really baggy and like so I can put my hands in like this and
A	yeah I like doing that but I can do that with

B	I wish I had
A	he I think he's good because well some people think he's a bit like boring cos he talks a lot which I guess is kind of true but I still think he's
B	I really wanted him because I feel like if I had him I'd be so petrified that I'd get so much work done and I'd be so scared that I was going to do badly and he was going to shout at me that I'd get really good marks on my tests
A	mm
B	I really wanted to get him and then I got
A	er thirty something minutes
