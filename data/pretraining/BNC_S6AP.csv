B	cos Hong Kong's Chinese now isn't it? of course yeah
A	yeah
B	right
A	it's like er
B	yes
A	er I was surprised to be honest that the that the Chinese government let them
B	right
A	but now they they sort of rode out the they're very clever the Chinese er government and er they rather than clamp down on it really harshly which a lot of people including myself were expecting
B	China
A	in erm
B	the mainland
A	in
B	they probably think they're helping people
A	sixty-five that's it
B	ah dear dear dear
A	well thinking you know if he's got it maybe I could get it
B	yeah
A	well you can just go down there and try and get the visa
B	yeah
A	come back
B	do you think you'd run into that age thing again though?
A	I don't think it applies if you're starting a business er business I don't think so
B	doesn't it?
A	well
B	yeah
A	it does worry me
B	that would affect what?
A	my application for a business permit

B	yeah cycling
A	would you be able to do it with your hand in a bandage?
B	no I don't think so but then again I suppose I could do some walking but it's not the same as cycling
A	yeah I was thinking about that today about exercise and you won't be able to drive so you won't be able to go out to the countryside just
B	no
A	do some walks along the sea front

A	yeah?
B	well I didn't hit anyone
A	mm well done
B	but you know a respectable woman she was you know shocked she was really frightened
A	mm
B	what what what things do you remember seeing when you were there that the Arabs?
A	well if you're going to score some dope it's going to be from an Arab
B	right
A	which which is you know in itself is fine but
B	why do they call them that?
A	I don't know I don't know but erm ah there are big problems in especially in Paris er with all the er the Arabs and the blacks
B	are they?
A	oh yeah no go areas some of them
B	wow
A	yeah
B	wow it's that bad?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	cos of the the whites were really scared that it was gonna kick off
B	well it's only the other side of the Mediterranean isn't it?
A	well yeah
B	it's not far away
A	but er but it didn't materialise
B	no
A	but er there is you know this fear in France is
B	yeah
A	that radicalised a lot of people
B	what?
A	exodus from France so French citizens
B	where did they chose to go?
A	well London's a favourite spot but also
B	really?
A	yeah
B	what for Parisians?
A	yeah they're there are many more er French leaving er France than ever before
B	good god
A	oh yeah
B	it's like the end of the Roman Empire isn't it?
A	well
B	the fall of the Roman Empire
A	it and especially Jewish families I know you you don't have much sympathy for them but er they
A	they they er they're really fearing er
B	oh I see yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and there are there are armed soldiers outside all these places now
B	oh my goodness
A	you don't remember we see those armed guys up above the station?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	they're everywhere
B	places
A	smacks of you know pre-war Germany doesn't it?
A	so they're they got record immigration to
B	yes
A	and they you know they don't they don't know the answer either
B	by Arabs?
A	mm
B	wow
A	yeah
B	I thoughts the Greeks
A	well it wasn't a true democracy as such it was only you had to be a citizen didn't you? and they had slaves and
B	oh I see yeah
A	so erm whether you should have the right to
B	I think you have to respect people
A	yeah but the the the question is should on one hand
B	by thinking
A	it it would you be
B	you could be accused of that
A	sure
B	riot about it who who erm who just said well that's you know I don't even want to know about it you know and I forgive them
A	well I think most Muslims do take that
B	I think most Muslims do take that line
A	yeah but
B	erm
A	we only hear about the minority don't we? the extremists
B	I can
A	it's a very delicate line this because it it carries on over to erm
B	Catholic nuns
A	well yeah yeah and but
B	the hijab
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	well quite it's what makes enriches the world isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I think the dangerous thing is when you start putting your stuff on other people as Muslims would put their stuff Christians put their stuff
A	mm
B	clergy and state
A	the state yeah
B	no
A	well they were
B	you know here and
A	but it's so much more intensified isn't it these days?
B	well I saw something the other day it said oh in they were doing a story on Rome and it said in
A	really?
B	so and I suspect the same is true
A	good lord
B	four families
A	well I think the numbers are certainly they used to be around one or two million for a long time didn't they? wasn't it? and then I seem to remember when we were kids that from geography lessons the population of London was about six to eight million something like that I think it's maybe a lot more now
B	yeah but when you when you look where at that area the city of London that once was
A	mm
B	although the city's
A	mm
B	I I think it was I think it was a guy called Alan Clark or John Clark
A	mm

A	most of it just got thrown out the window think didn't it?
B	yeah well it used didn't it?
