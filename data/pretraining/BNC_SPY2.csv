A	throw them out and
B	there we go
A	see how we go
B	well thank you very much for talking to me today
A	my pleasure
B	and what I'd like to ask you I'm looking at your form here is that you were a TV producer and I find that absolutely fascinating could you tell me more about the sort of programmes you produced?
A	yes well er well
B	right
A	and his interests were apart from biology photography
B	yeah
A	would walk past
B	mm
A	notice erm seeing detail er one particular memory erm I have was father taking me for a walk in
A	and er he couldn't be seen to be favouring me so he probably
B	mm
A	marked me down a bit I wouldn't be at all surprised
B	yeah
A	so I I found that quite easy so of course I went to university and I did biology there because it was the easiest thing for me and I enjoyed it of course
B	yeah
A	er so at the end of university I had to think okay what am I going to do? because until then I was just enjoying life and I decided because of er er of the influence my father had on on photography on my photography that I would go to erm
B	mm
A	when it's dark
B	uhu
A	they have amazing sense of hearing and of smell so you've got lots of problems to solve anyway he solved all those and er resulting film appeared on the BBC in Bristol er introduced by Peter Scott and er he used to do a number of radio programmes as well er Nature Parliament and Country Questions answering questions
B	yes
A	that the public had sent in and so on and so forth and I would go up with him sometimes just to sort of see what it was all about
B	mm
B	uhu
A	only having had an introduction into film work
B	how amazing
A	the London thing
B	yeah
A	so I'll go in for this this'll
B	mm
A	be interesting so I was interviewed for that and er to my great surprise erm I got a letter from er the school television department in London to say erm er we we can't offer you this job of production assistant level er because of your lack of experience but we would like to offer you a job as a researcher again with school programmes
B	mm
A	er on a variety of subjects and so on and a few days later I got a a letter from the BBC in Bristol er that said er you know er thank you for coming for interview etcetera etcetera etcetera erm er we er we don't think er you have enough experience to come in at production assistant level but we would like to offer you the job as a researcher on natural history programmes in Bristol
A	and I remember that the salary was er twelve hundred and twelve hundred and seventy-five pounds or something and er in London it was thirteen hundred and something because of the London weighting etcetera etcetera but basically
B	mm
A	it was the same so I
B	yeah
A	if you like and I decided that well the Bristol one I know much more about but really what would be really exciting for me would be to learn about studio production
B	right
A	and so I went to the BBC in London and for thirteen years I learnt the craft of erm television production directing producing erm going from researcher to production assistant to assistant producer to producer to executive producer and and working with erm fast turnover programmes short programmes with low budgets
B	right
A	you get a huge amount of experience in a relatively short period of time and I was er very lucky to have done er studio productions erm recorded as live on a whole variety of subjects
B	mm
A	which included biology erm but all kinds of other things er general studies which in those days was erm anything thought to be important that wasn't on a syllabus and so that was you know
B	uhu
A	sex and drugs and religion and religion and politics
B	mm
A	and and all kinds of wonderful things
B	mm
A	but eventually I had to think well this is all very good all very fascinating but isn't it perhaps time I sort of specialised in something? erm and the one thing that frustrated me with erm school television was the size of the budget and the length of the programme erm I wanted to do something that was a bit more ambitious and erm a bigger budget like fifty minute programmes and I thought well really I'm now ready to do some natural history programmes but bringing to an outer history unit in Bristol some wider experience than
B	yes
A	most of the people there had so that probably I would have a chance when when a a job came up
B	oh right
A	erm and I thought no I won't get that er but at the same time er there was a job for a producer on erm a long running series called The World About Us and I thought oh that's more like it er so I went in for that and erm had a long interview and and er er they said could you
A	and that was extraordinary the reasoning was erm because David Attenborough was there and there was an executive producer
B	right
A	whereas now he narrates other people's work and all
B	mm
A	erm and therefore the element they were in doubt about as far as my experience was concerned was basically covered by the experience of the existing team and er other aspects they thought I could do er so they offered it to me and I took it
B	oh my goodness
A	erm but in a funny way er then you're you're still not you're still not writing er fifty minute scripts
B	no no
A	you're looking after er mm mm a rather different kind of project
B	yeah
A	er er and I thought mm well I'm not sure I really want it but I don't want to be ruled by them and then maybe if I don't go in for it one day I'm gonna curse myself you really should have done that because you only get
B	mm
A	this opportunity once er so I went in for it and after an awful lot of humming and harring er by other people in charge they decided to give it to me erm so I did that and then
B	yes
A	and I didn't want to step down from being head and then making programmes again it's also a difficult issue for the new head and and
B	it's it's
A	so on
B	true yeah
A	er
B	mm
A	er enjoy it so I got out and then I joined a er a commercial television er production company in London I wanted to get back to London er called
B	mm
A	but involved the same people I'd met all over the world doing natural history and so on erm but it was it was commercial it was a very different thing I was offered a three year er fixed contract meaning at the end it would end whatever happened erm and my job was to set this up to buy up film from all over the world that either hadn't been used or was getting tired and needed to be reinvigorated turned into new programmes and so on and so forth and to commission new stuff and er I did that and they seemed to be very pleased and at the end of it erm er I knew that was it because I'd proved to myself that financially it made no sense to originate completely new types of programmes erm which would cost a lot of money er where there's a risk factor as there always is in natural history filming you know things can go wrong and so on and so forth
B	yeah
A	and if you work for a commercial company you've got to deliver and I proved that you could get highly saleable productions from existing sources and and catalogues and library catalogues and so on and so forth build up an immense library for very little money in comparison to doing the new stuff erm I knew that they knew that they preferred that so I went
B	uhu
A	that was it and then after a number of years of of doing consultant work with other broadcasters in places like New Zealand and the States I thought well I've sort of done it erm I'm only er going round and round and round and the programmes are getting ever less interesting to me erm why not get back to my original interest which was photography? erm I was able to retire so I did and I'm still doing it still doing the photography
B	oh right
A	and the photography
B	yes
A	so each each one has that sort of theme to it and the idea is er to have exhibitions of of these pictures and get particularly children er preferably families but with children in them to come and for the kids to see these things and to work out what they're looking at cos they have so much imagination it's absolutely amazing and therefore to get them interested in going out into into the wilds going out into nature I mean it could be a park it could be garden it doesn't have to be an exotic place and see if they can
B	yeah
A	and appreciate nature and that's where it goes sort of full circle back from where I started and my parents took me out and I got interested in nature and this is sort of my way of encouraging youngsters to do
B	right
A	the same sort of thing
B	oh right
A	and erm fortunately er the
B	right
A	we've got and he was of course inspired by nature in his way and he's expressed it in his way and we're combining this into an exhibition called
B	oh right that's exiting
A	so we we've gone we've gone the full circle
B	yes
A	in
B	right
A	which is still there
B	oh yes?
A	erm and then moved into
B	mm
A	although it's changed completely as a result of the oil which happened after I left there erm
A	I like this
B	yes fantastic
A	yeah
B	position
A	it is a fantastic position and I was lucky having done what I've done that I
B	mm
A	had a property in
B	oh yes
A	erm you've got enough money to buy it
B	yes
A	so erm it needed a lot of work er cos it was owned for at least a decade by erm a couple who were both doctors with teenage children and having teenage children and being very busy people they didn't do an awful lot to keep this place going and it needed
B	oh
A	needed help
B	yes
A	erm but I was very interested er to try that out and and do things and I did and that's now done erm so I'm I'm quite pleased really it is a nice spot
B	very
A	and it
B	very nice spot
A	mm mm
B	so tell me a little bit more about the work you're going to be putting into the exhibition I know you said it's making children or people look at shapes and and so on
A	mm
B	within the
A	mm
B	erm within the exhibition and within the the work erm I don't know whether
A	really?
B	and erm I got
A	that's interesting
B	a distinction for my photography
A	good for you
A	good for you
A	yeah
B	you were a photographer when I came in
A	yeah
B	so
A	right right right
B	erm
A	er mm
B	it it and and I erm I'm I'm I wouldn't mind the chance to show it to you actually but I erm I I do sort of abstract I'm very close up things and and distort so that so they're distorted to a point
A	mm mm
B	I don't actually photoshop or anything like that
A	right right right
B	I do straightforward
A	I don't either yeah
B	and but erm I did go to the home of Dylan Thomas recently er er I was going to a funeral actually we were in Wales and we went to Dylan Thomas's house and I took a photograph from above his house in Laugharne onto the estuary erm and I'd just to show it to somebody who's got some knowledge of photography erm and I'm really pleased with it and I I've got
A	mm
B	two large erm one's a canvas and the other is just an ordinary erm
A	mm
B	but I'd love er you to look at it and tell me
A	mm
B	what you think
A	sure
B	because everyone keeps telling me how good it is
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's an award winning photograph
A	yeah
B	er are they
A	yeah
B	being polite?
A	right
B	if you see what I mean
A	right right yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	but do show me
A	yeah
B	something that you've got I can put this on
A	I've got I've got a book
B	oh have you?
A	er if you put that on hold I'll
B	put that on hold alright
A	I can't remember where it is actually it might be here or it might be upstairs erm
B	so
B	erm
A	mm well the you get a get a quick impression of my impressions
B	ah
A	so you get an
B	yes
A	idea of the sort of things I'm I'm talking about
B	yes
A	erm
B	a wild boar in the wood there this is wonderful isn't it? it's such a camouflaged type
A	yeah
B	erm and this is like someone standing with one leg at the
A	that's right
B	isn't it?
A	that's right
B	I I I do go for that I do go for
A	yeah
B	human shapes
A	all these sort of things
B	yeah
A	what I'm
B	erm
A	careful to do is not to label them with what I think they are
B	no exactly
A	or
B	yeah
A	and that's absolutely right
B	yeah
A	erm I think that one's fairly obviously but some are more obvious than others as to what they are
B	yes exactly well when we're just looking at some erm barks and erm seeing erm patterns and disturbances in the bark that can emulate some other type of erm
A	faces or
B	face yeah and that's really attractive isn't it?
A	the face yeah in that bright colours
B	that's like an abstract design erm in
A	er yeah there's an eye and a
B	an eye yes yes
A	etcetera erm
B	yes yes I see yes I see
A	yeah
B	yeah er
A	some things are immediately well I get the get the idea sort of thing
B	yes
A	and others take a long time
B	yes
A	erm but but I mean they're very quick these are the sort of the
B	oh yes that's a wonderful profile
A	I've done
B	you've got there
A	lots of bark pictures
B	yeah
A	I erm I haven't done anything with rust
B	rust can be
A	erm
B	a a similar type of
A	oh it can
B	yeah it can see
A	yeah
B	all sorts of things in rust
A	I've got a book on rust
B	have you?
B	yeah
A	who who is actually the wife of the previous head of the
B	oh right
B	yes
A	erm
B	yes
A	and er she did a lot of er photographs of that
B	yeah
A	and then she's turned them into tapestry
B	oh right yeah
A	er another art form
B	yeah
A	which is erm
B	now the the the we're looking here at they
B	they look like erm hummingbirds don't they?
A	mm
B	erm
A	absolutely
B	and as if they're taking the nectar out of the plant
A	yeah
B	but they are actually it is a plant
A	it is a plant
B	er which looks like hummingbirds
A	yeah
B	yeah it's
A	yeah
B	that's wonderful
A	it's it's actually called a bird flower
B	er is it?
A	erm yes
B	oh right I I'm not
B	I don't know very about er
A	it's
B	Australian it's endemic
A	it's er and er er
B	oh gosh that's an ostrich as I live and die isn't it?
A	that's right
A	that's right
B	yeah that's wonderful
A	that's rather fun that's er er
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	er as that is
B	yeah
A	which is rather fun yeah
B	this it is
A	but er yeah and that well
B	oh
A	as an insect
B	as an insect
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I can see the insect
A	well that is just two fig leaves
B	yeah yes
A	and if I describe I describe it as
B	yeah
A	two fig leaves
B	fig leaves are wonderful
B	I was observing fig leaves
A	yeah they are yeah
B	yesterday
A	oh really?
B	particularly this time of yeah
A	yeah
B	yes I was at erm
A	oh yes yeah I know yeah
B	sitting in the car park erm
A	mm
B	erm waiting to meet somebody
A	mm
B	and erm and they they're just such wonderful naïve shapes
A	yeah
B	erm er yet when you look at them there's actually almost like a serrated edge around the rim of each root yeah
A	oh
B	they look perfectly erm shaped
A	mm
B	and smooth but they're not they've got a slight serrated edge round I which I'd never noticed before and that was because I was looking at them carefully yesterday
B	oh your seals there aren't they?
A	there you are straight away you got that
B	wonderful? yeah
A	and this is water only it isn't water
B	oh right
A	it it's dried salt
B	oh I see
A	because of the splashing cos it's on er on on the coast er
B	goodness this could be an elephant
A	that's that's very difficult erm
B	yeah
A	to me it's a conversation between three
B	right
A	it'll be three heads the three animals er but er most people don't see it so
B	no
A	might have to repeal that one erm
B	that could be Antony
A	yes
B	did you see the programme this week?
A	I just recorded it
B	I recorded it
A	and I haven't seen it yet
B	I haven't seen it yet no
A	cos it it's quite long isn't it?
B	and there's an eagle
A	yeah
B	or maybe
A	I mean it it when you think about it
B	yeah
A	it
B	yes exactly
A	in the Egyptian desert but it it is extraordinary isn't it?
B	yes
A	that that is a bird
B	yes
A	and even it's got a chick under its wing there
B	yes
A	but mm not everybody sees that erm
B	when when that
A	that sort of marching across
B	yes
A	the desert the kind of bear like
B	I see it's it's
A	creature I suppose
B	I see it as a man crouching in despair
A	or
B	erm
A	I think
A	it could be
B	it's whatever
A	or
B	you think it is and that's all to do with perception isn't it?
A	of course it is
B	er and people
A	of course it is
B	people perceive all sorts of things
A	yeah er
B	completely differently
B	oh right
A	and that's my white elephant erm
B	right
A	quite extraordinary
B	yeah
A	the things you can just
B	I love the
A	find
B	colour of the sand in that one
A	mm
B	it is sand isn't it?
A	it is sand yes yes yes yes yes
B	yeah it's
A	yeah that's in the middle of nowhere
B	yeah
A	in in Egypt erm
B	yes
A	erm and that's obviously birdlike
B	yes it is birdlike
A	again it's just eroded granite I mean that's all it is
B	yeah
A	that's that's not a hippo that's
B	is it?
B	this one looks like
A	to me that was more shark like but
B	shark like
A	erm er
B	oh right how interesting
B	oh right
A	the mouth
B	yes
A	and that's the snout I
B	yeah yeah
A	but again most people wouldn't wouldn't see anything in this at all
B	and this this looks like a cave drawing erm er er er er you know an early cave drawing? erm but erm I erm I ought to stand up and look down on it really
A	I er you should in a way yeah
B	erm I can almost see a bird this way
A	yeah
B	that way it almost looks like erm that's the head of a woman really and they're running but and it's
A	it's a dancer
B	a dancer yes
A	yeah er or a running hare
B	yes oh yes a running hare now I see it
A	yeah the hare the
B	yes
A	and amazingly
B	yeah
A	and I didn't
B	it's just there yeah
A	er it's a it's a mussel but it's a
B	yes
B	yeah
A	in the cracks er
B	and that looks like it's an early Chinese painting
A	it does look a Chinese
B	yeah
A	it does look Chinese
A	yeah yeah
A	but that's supposed to be mother and calf
B	yeah
A	I mean the erm a dolphin or a whale or something of that sort swimming with all the water
B	yeah
A	and but it's a sandstone cliff
B	very nice
A	erm
B	lovely colours that could almost be a Henry Moore there
A	this is the Henry Moore
B	and here er well both of them
B	yes
A	isn't it?
B	yes it is
A	the hand and er the funny eye
B	yeah
A	or or Picasso sort of thing erm
B	oh wow
A	you've almost got two eyes a nose and a mouth
B	yeah
A	but no that's just er
B	erm that makes me think of erm I'm trying to think of his name now the very weird man
A	Dali?
B	Dali
A	yeah
B	because he
A	yeah
B	er he sort of
A	yeah
B	he dismembered things
A	did crazy things
B	and put the yes
A	yes
B	crazy things
A	he took noses and
B	yes he did
B	yes that was a
A	yeah
B	Salvador Dali crikey
A	but that I find absolutely extraordinary I mean er
B	yeah
A	this is what I call the
B	yeah
A	erm that whale on its side and that one with its fin
B	yeah
A	and yet it is simply of course eroded granite
B	yes yeah
A	I mean the shapes are just
B	it
A	unbelievable
B	yeah
A	unbelievable I think
B	yeah
A	erm nature is quite extraordinary now that is the same picture
B	yeah
A	just turned
B	yeah
A	and there are a number of examples like that erm
B	yeah
A	er that's like one of these sort of visual tests can you
B	yes
A	of a flying bird? erm some can but quite a lot of people can't see it at all
B	or or it might be
A	or simply don't notice it
B	easily be looking down from space
A	oh yes it could be huge
A	like the scale
B	yeah this
A	this could be a city
B	yes it could
A	I mean all these could be buildings
B	yeah
A	or something
B	it could be
A	yeah yeah erm I've got an awful lot of dogs erm
B	yes I can see the dog there
A	that's more Alsatian and this is
B	yeah
A	Poodle
B	oh definitely a Poodle
A	erm or a the Chinese character but
B	yeah no I
A	I see it as a I
B	I like a
A	straightaway
B	like the Poodle
A	I thought it's a Poodle well I like that er but that's an old dog sleeping semi sleeping and that's quite extraordinary
B	it is
A	and that cos without that you haven't got a picture
B	no exactly
A	it's just like it's one of these
B	yeah
A	it just happens to be in the right place
B	there's an old dog alright
A	erm yeah and so
B	again
A	and so it goes on but you get the idea
B	yeah yeah
A	erm oh god I mean that is extraordinary too
B	yes
A	I mean that's my tiger I only had it it's just sandstone the way it's eroded
B	the way that to me is definitely is a mouse and the way it's
A	yes yes
B	there is a very
A	yeah
B	humanistic mouse
A	it oh it is it is yes definitely
B	you know
A	definitely yeah
B	erm
A	but with the stripes
B	yes
A	has to be a tiger
B	a tiger yeah
A	yeah
B	that's a bird
A	that's a bird
B	a penguin I suppose
A	sort of the yeah
B	a sort of penguin
A	I mean it's closest to a penguin I think
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah erm
B	oh we've got a seal again
A	and so it goes on and so it goes on and that's
B	and the owl at the end
A	that's that one
B	oh
A	so
B	oh thank you for that
A	I'm gonna do another one
B	yeah
A	of this
A	yes
B	it is?
A	it is
B	yes
A	yes
B	amazing I've never come across one of those
A	yeah that's
B	so erm
A	Australian
B	yeah
A	well I I've got some pictures er not there just here
B	oh right

B	my goodness would that be a pelican do you think?
A	dodo
B	a dodo yeah a dodo
A	well one of one of those sort of
B	yeah
A	things er or a whale stork or one of those odd creatures er see if you then turn your head to the left
B	yeah
A	you'll see what it really is
B	oh I see oh goodness it's a lakeside picture
A	it's just a reflection
B	how interesting
A	er of hills in still water
B	yeah did you see the dodo in
A	mm no
B	a stuffed dodo
A	oh right oh right no
B	erm for years and years
A	yeah yeah
B	and they also had and I went in one day and I asked them what had they done to it
A	yeah
B	because I I remember I went to school in
A	yeah
B	and I used to go in there regularly and look at the erm the things in in cases and they were all in in big glass er cages
A	mm
B	not cages erm er er boxes
A	mm
B	and I I used to think how marvellous they were and they became like friends because they were always there
A	mm
B	and there was a big
A	mm
B	so anyway this
A	mm
B	again it's almost
A	and that's that one
B	a sort of like a sort of Aztec type look to it
A	yes very very solid
B	yes it is
A	very elemental
B	very solid yeah
A	mm
B	and then
A	and
B	oh right
A	oh that that's a

A	there and that that one there that's that one
B	right
B	oh I'm
A	yeah
B	I'm absolutely intrigued
B	I'm so glad that I came
A	well
B	what a wonderful erm what a wonderful interview
A	well it is a bit different the erm
B	it is
A	there's my my interest er being interested in photography erm you think well what kind of photography? er and that is
B	yes
A	and in this day and age when if an editor wants a picture of a of a blackbird just goes on the internet and does all these all all the libraries and are now up in
B	mm
A	er up in the cloud they can in no time at all get the finest pictures ever taken of whatever it is
B	yes
A	they're looking for
B	yes absolutely
A	so what is the point other than the sheer enjoyment of doing so erm going to huge lengths to try and take a picture that isn't as good
B	absolutely yeah I I
A	as other people? and having this interest in in in camouflage and detail and and art
B	yes
A	er my interest was to get pictures for the wall
B	yeah
A	erm it's got to be something else and and that natural
B	no
A	actually
B	no you can't
A	and fortunately er not everybody's doing that sort of thing so this collection when it comes down to
B	yes
A	erm I think will interest people because I've had er two dry runs erm two exhibitions in France we we used to have a house down in the south and it's because of those that I wanted to take it further because
B	mm
A	we would contact schools and the teachers would bring the children and er the children I'm talking about ages around about sort of of eleven no the eight up through to about fourteen the interesting period
B	yes yes yes
A	er they would come and the
B	yes
A	write these down and erm tell the rest of us why you like them and what you see in them and they were seeing things that of course I hadn't got a clue about at all
B	no
A	and their imagination came out and their interest erm and the extraordinary thing was er to me that they they would come in the week and then at the weekend some of them would drag their parents back
B	yeah
A	to see it and the kids would sort of curate the show they'd say mummy or mummy you've got to see this
A	now what do you see in this? and
A	all this kind of thing and it was amazing er and a few of the parents erm afterwards would say erm
B	yes
A	erm so that they can find things
B	thing yes
A	and erm they'd got their little mobile phone
B	yes
A	they were finding
B	yes
A	erm and I thought that was fantastic
B	yeah
A	really did
B	it is good it is good when it erm sort of frees people's imagination I I found a root once a broken root which looked like a leg and a hip erm and there was a
A	mm
B	and erm I I took it home and I made a clay shoe to go on it a red clay stiletto heel
A	mm
B	er which I er baked in the oven it was one of those
A	right
B	hobby craft clay things
A	yeah
B	and I stuck it on the end and I put the thing on a back and I hung it in an exhibition in the conference room
A	mm
B	and the principal bought it
B	and
A	mm mm
B	do you want to put on this? the principal's asking how much it is
A	er yeah yeah
B	and I thought well you know when I thought how how much it took me how quick it was to make cos it was a found object
A	yeah
B	but then I'd embellished it
A	yeah
B	but then art today is all about the found object and you are actually
A	mm mm mm
B	using the found object in your photography
A	they're all found objects yeah
B	which is fantastic
A	yeah
B	erm anyway you know I asked for what I thought was a reasonable sum
A	mm
B	erm but erm yes I mean a lot of unknown artists ask far too much for their work and erm
A	mm mm
B	it was the first thing I sold erm while I was a student
A	mm
B	but I've sold a lot more now and a lot of my work is I have a lot of photographs
A	mm
B	erm in my dentist's she's got them on permanent display erm
A	yeah
B	they're all rather weird erm
A	yeah
B	it's
A	mm
B	erm and she's had them er for erm what? two or three years now
A	right right
B	erm and every time I go in I
A	yeah yeah
B	it's like a time has elapsed and I've gone on and I've been doing other things now and it I
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	passed
A	yeah
B	passed by but erm yes it it it was erm yeah it doing the art degree at the age of erm fifty-eight I did the art degree fifty-eight fifty-nine
A	mm
B	erm it was very late to do it but
A	mm mm
B	I'm really glad I did it
A	mm
B	because I
A	yeah
B	I've gone back to painting a bit at the moment erm
A	mm
B	but I'm I don't I like experimenting I just couldn't say well this is the way I paint or this is the way I do this and I'm always gonna do it like this I've gotta
A	mm
B	keep diversifying
A	mm
B	to keep myself interested really
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but then it confuses people so they can't identify with you so
B	mm
A	look at that the two things are connected it it's
B	oh yes
A	it's my brother's work
B	oh is it? this
A	yeah
B	here? oh it's
A	yeah
B	lovely I I have been
A	and
B	looking at it actually
A	erm
B	yeah
A	but that's about as far as you go you won't think it's connected to the one at the back because why would you? and so on and so on and so on
B	mm
A	erm but in fact it it's it's meant to be a piece erm about our ancestry
B	right
A	because my
B	right
A	in western Scotland and that was a a a a fairly tragic time and my brother went up to see if he could track down the the the cottage and eventually he could and he tracked down the graveyard and he found a tombstone and so on and so forth and he wanted to do something that related to that sort of erm er brutal time of their erm being turfed off their land and so on and so forth so when he went and he'd found the the area he saw that the land now was covered in gorse and he thought mm gorse and er knowing a bit about gorse well they've got these
B	oh I see it now
A	dried pods
B	yes yes
A	which twist when they dry out
B	yes
A	and then they explode
B	right
A	they are distributed
B	yeah
A	they they're moved and he thought well we could do something about gorse and erm he also went to a museum of agricultural implements which showed the kind of ploughs that were used in those days
B	yeah
A	which similar to
B	yes
A	erm where this represents erm I can't remember which way round it is now if that's the sock it's what turns the soil
B	yeah
A	soil over and this is the coulter
B	right
A	or it's the other way round that does the
B	right
A	actual ploughing
B	yeah
A	so the two pieces dig and turn erm and then looking at the erm at the the gorse pod itself when it twists it's a bit like that that that's the opened
B	yeah
A	the opened pod and the the seeds come up erm and this of course is gorse he took a photograph
B	yes
A	and it's quite accurate but of course he's toned down the yellow
B	yes
A	erm here is a representation of the the the what was left of the cottage which is just a pile of stones
B	yeah
A	er this indicates age because on the tombstones the
B	yeah
A	slowly grows out lichen that slowly grows out and this is an impression of the sock and coulter which is traditional in that part of the world that that put on the gravestones so
B	oh I see
A	so the
B	yeah
A	that's that and that is a timer like an egg timer
B	right
A	that gives the passage of time etcetera
B	right
A	etcetera etcetera and putting the two together I think it's actually a bit close but erm er it tells the story
B	yes
A	of that period of our family history well to us knowing that that's very interesting
B	yeah
A	but to other people it's you either like it or you don't
B	well
A	type of thing
B	I think it's wonderful I've been
A	er
B	fascinated by it while you've been talking and it's very pleasing to the eye the other thing that I would
A	yeah yeah
B	it's got the suffragette colours in it
A	interesting
B	it's got purple and lemon or yellow
A	yeah yes
B	and it has well I mean they were under suffrage weren't they? and they were
A	absolutely
B	turned out and er
A	I must tell
B	yeah
A	whether he he has
B	er
A	any er
B	and the only reason I well I do know before I did know before but I went to the suffragette film recently which has
A	mm
B	been acclaimed
A	mm mm mm
B	greatly
A	mm
B	erm although my husband and I felt it was more like a drama documentary we we we did appreciate it we thought it was very good but we wouldn't say it was the best film of the year or some of the things they're
A	yeah
B	saying about it but it was good erm but yes I I was very all the ladies were wearing yellow and erm er lilac or purple
A	mm
B	flowers in their hats and
A	interesting
B	so on and so forth
A	yeah oh I must tell
B	he well he he might he might he might have known it might even have been
A	he might have known that
B	it might have even been in in is
A	he he'd not mentioned it to me
B	no
A	I don't know
B	no?
A	erm
B	right
A	and then fortunately it was it was too big for him so I bought it off him so
B	oh right
A	and he's got a half sized version for his house
B	but it's very nice
A	so there's more room
B	it goes beautifully in this room it's just
A	it
B	very nice indeed
A	yeah it does yeah
B	have you had enough? shall I
A	I'm sure whoever's got to go through this stuff has
A	got more than enough
B	so
A	yeah quite enough yeah
B	I'm just going to stop it erm
A	I don't know if anyone is going to conclude
