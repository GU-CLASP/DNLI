A	I think he's going nuts
B	I think right well that was pretty crazy what just came out of your mouth
A	yeah that's normal
B	that's a really good idea drink with crazy horse
A	psycho
B	and then
A	I think because he is a psycho so he can't see it
B	did he tell you think thing about the phone
A	she must be let's be honest
B	so they're
A	she only just met him
B	it's only been a few days
A	yeah yeah I do as well
B	I'm deliberately picking holes in everything he says but I can't help it because everything he says is mental
A	Wednesday's hump day of the week
B	hump day
A	I don't think you're being a twat
B	I can't  I can't  hide me
A	that that yesterday was just the straw for me final straw
B	mm
A	oh god knows
B	mm
A	I put it in a deceptive bowl though
B	quite a lot of it
A	especially considering it's my second dinner
B	it's not really your second dinner
A	and a Fajita
B	no it's still not dinner
A	yeah cos I was thinking about it today I thought actually I can't be hacked with trying to organise something to come
B	that you don't even want to have
A	yeah that I don't even want to have
B	yeah
A	not some half-hearted all my mates having a party at my house so yeah let's go
B	yeah weird
A	yeah
B	I know it worries me
A	mm
B	yeah I think he's that skinny little one
A	skinny weirdo yeah
B	yeah and then that weird one that was with
A	mm
B	yeah
A	fucking
B	I wondered if Grace was cooing round to be like oh are you
A	to be honest I'd rather have her back than bloody
B	noisy feet
A	noisy feet upstairs
B	fun
A	and then or teaches you how to make two cocktails and then he gives you loads of ingredients and splits you into two teams and you have to make your own cocktail and then he judges the winner and whatever one wins is the cocktail of the week at the hotel
B	wow that's such a good idea
A	yeah and I think  I think  it's like twelve pound a head for one to have one cocktail each out of it or twenty pound head to have two cocktails reach out of it
B	winner
A	Cos I get fifty per cent off at the hotel don't I?
B	that sounds like a bargain? Does that extend to your friends?
A	yeah I think I'd book it and pay for the lot
B	oh right
A	so as far as they're concerned I pay for everything
B	it's all on your bill it's your bill
A	mm
B	ah well that sounds pretty exciting
A	so that would be fun thing to do
B	yeah it sounds really fun even if it is at work it's whether you want to spend your birthday at work but even
A	yeah but we'd only be there for an hour or two
B	yeah and then you're well placed you know for carrying o the festivities
A	yeah so I thought that would be fun
B	mm
A	something easy you know when I don't
B	yeah and then
A	I know
B	yeah we won't talk about dates
A	no
B	I used to tell
A	mm
B	I think just put your foot down
A	I'm gonna
B	yeah
A	Cos they have like life if it's a a deal then you don't get half price or something I don't know
B	mm
B	ah nice
A	everything
B	mm
A	gone to the dinner
B	mm
A	yeah he is really nice
B	is he the one with the funny wife
A	even though I'm convinced he's gay
B	but then where is she Philippines or something
A	mm
B	mm
A	oh I wasn't sure if the Philippines was in Malaysia
B	em no mm
A	no
B	sounds lovely though
A	sounds really nice
B	sO how was work
A	we shall see
B	oh god
A	and the accountants still saying no we're not refunding it until they've provided other card details and I was like but they can't do that
B	mm
A	it's not  It's not  a business card
B	Jesus
A	I'm just going to go and put the phone down
B	I think it's just recorded messages
A	if anybody's ever rung they've never got through if I've been in
B	you animal did you leave it at home
A	yeah I forgot it didn't I?
B	ah saggy boobs
A	yeah
B	at least you've got a bit of em support in the dress though
A	no no
B	wow
A	that was yum
B	delish
A	delishioso
B	oh I spoke to one of my suppliers this morning
A	not the three grand one?
B	huh the three grand?
A	not the three grand one
B	no but that's still bumbling along
A	oh no
B	and so god knows what's happening with that
A	are you going to tell me he smoked pot?
B	yeah he's like I got stoned
A	and I was like oh nice
A	you don't tell someone you work with that
B	no or work for which is even worse
A	yeah
B	so he's very em very relaxed about these things
A	yeah it turns out
B	Cos I told
A	no there isn't
B	Good that sound fun
A	oh good yeah
B	moving swiftly on
A	ah nice
B	huh
A	ah brilliant
B	which was good and then it was juts downhill from there
A	ah frigging calves
B	my bike makes a nice crunching noise now like its going over Coco Pops like over and over
A	ah
B	yeah so that's a new development
A	yeah yeah don't worry about that yet
B	mm
A	yeah I was going to leave but then I thought well if somebody comes in and there's no one here
B	yeah that might be a sackable offense
A	yeah so I em I waited
B	did it want to explode in her wardrobe?
A	must have done it really made me laugh
B	that's funny
A	and her friend
B	mm hm
A	yeah yeah I think so
B	Steve Zuckerman or whatever his name is have bought Instagram hasn't he? From Apple
A	yeah yeah
B	for some ridiculous amount of money
A	yeah and it's gone straight to the top of the apps chart hasn't it? I like Instagram
B	mm
A	whenever
B	well if you've got things like that everyone's good a photography then
A	mm
B	I managed to avoid getting any
A	so he's got no fingerprints
B	yeah
A	ah yeah
B	he's like a criminal
A	I always thought that you know if you were going to be a criminal you could put superglue on your fingertips
B	there you go
A	gets rid of all your all all that goodness
B	all those  All those  traceable things
A	all those
B	mm
A	of course when I rob a bank I'll be prepared
B	mm hm
A	when my plan comes together
B	it's good that you've given it some thought
A	yeah yeah
B	how did you manage it?
A	Cos I needed to top my phone up and I'd left my card here
B	no I was em
A	that's what I thought
B	I know
A	yeah could have been any
B	that would be pretty weird wouldn't it? There are two
A	right
B	yeah bitch
A	but I didn't look at her
B	I think we must be related distantly because I know that sounds mental but it's not a a common name
A	rare
B	rarer
A	more rare
B	more rare
A	all the rare
B	not the rare
A	ah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	ah it's good for you
A	whatever
B	really?
A	yeah
B	Good girl though
A	em
B	especially on a budget
A	yeah yeah budget would not stretch
B	mm mm
A	em and then it's going to have to be Aqua tomorrow
B	aqua
A	maybe
B	one of one of those things
A	maybe it's six thirty
B	oh that's fine
A	oh that's a point if it's six-thirty I might not make it in time will I?
B	no
A	yeah
B	I could pick you up but we won't if it's six thirty we won't get there in time with the traffic
A	we might make it if I took my swimming stuff with me
B	it's just getting out of
A	mm
B	but that that's the problem isn't it? But then at least you know not that it would have been school traffic at the at time any way but the schools aren't in
A	yeah it didn't take me very long today cos I before I came home which time? What time was I home for
B	okay
A	oh I drove up
B	oh did you? Was it alright?
A	I went  I went  from
B	mm but it moves quite quickly
A	but once it moves you move
B	oh fine okay
B	bless you
A	so it might be possible
B	but to be honest
A	or if I put my swimming if I take my swimming costume with me put it on under my dress that when we get there I just have to strip off
B	well that's fine if I if you walk I will run come home get in the car get you em and then this fine
A	yes
B	but then they might try and park you
A	they might try and park you but also if another car comes the can't get round you
B	well I'll try and time it that I'm there at six but I'll probably try and leave a bit early because of the traffic
A	well I could probably leave early tomorrow if everyone else has left again
B	that's true
A	might be able to sneak out
B	get the old Mobile on the go when I'm on my way
A	look at that bad boy
B	I should have put it outside
A	does it know the temperature
B	it does know the temperature
A	eh yeah
B	with that all that whole swimming pool set underneath that there
A	yeah that little pool yeah
B	that little he yeah got a bit carried away
A	yep
B	so I might drain that away and give it a bit water actually that's a bit grim
A	chuck them in those pots
B	yeah got a wash my bike cos it's pretty grim
A	ah yeah that's good
B	yeah but I just took the stiff back to Primark and then left really quickly before I got distracted by all of the things that I need
A	yes
B	I was going to take things to the charity shop but as much as you know I'm in to charity shops I thought if I go in I'll only buy more stuff
A	I do like doing the charity shops
B	yeah
A	no
B	I ne dress yes yeah that's definitely going to happen
A	I think  I think  that's only fair
B	I think that is definitely the law
A	I was planning on losing four pounds again this week and I don't think that's going to happen
B	you're not eating any food
A	I am
B	well no
A	I've had to teas
B	no
A	I had two teas I had two sausages for breakfast today

A	I'm just looking forward to my legs not hurting cos I'm gonna try and run three mile don Friday
B	why?

B	power on through
A	yeah
B	well I suppose now you're relay getting your time down then you can do that can't you? You know you've got
A	yeah I don't
B	yeah absolutely but you want to have a bit of safety margin
A	but we don't yeah
B	fine
A	I didn't text
B	just give up
A	he texted me today saying hello sexy bum
B	he's all about the game playing
A	all he's all about the game playing
B	that's obviously how you keep a hymn interested is you just play the game
A	yeah to a degree
B	and then everyone just gets really fucked off
A	yeah and thinks why the fuck did I start talking to you again? This is exactly why
B	you're a knob
A	did they?
B	mm
A	I was going to say do you think they were really the trousers

A	do you think? I can't decide whether he's crazy or he's really stupid
B	bit of both  Bit of both And and just you know not educated really
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	and he obviously never gets pulled up on it
B	mm
A	frigging idiot
B	yeah thanks for that
A	in my house and I said to him it's my house
B	mm
A	he said eh it's my house
B	that's what he said it's my house
A	I want to kick him in the head
B	fair enough don't we all
A	that grill that was here though I'm sure he said sonly twenty
B	yeah twenty-six I think
A	she looked well older than twenty-six
B	do you think she's having him on?
A	yeah
B	she does she's got
A	did you see her wrinkles?
B	she's got a lot of lines yeah
A	yeah

A	yeah
B	em yeah she did have lines
A	she looked  She looked  old
B	yeah I mean maybe she's tired
A	yeah cos you've got sense
B	Cos I've got a brain
A	did I tell  Did I tell  you I was joking to dad about walking round in a bikini
B	with your dad?
A	not not with my dad but I was joking with my dad
B	oh right
A	I was just like
B	yeah
A	he's like right okay and I said em and then obviously there'll be twelve week intensive training then after that it'll be more leadership based
B	yeah
A	secretly cry
B	sob
A	sob secretly
B	defeat
A	I won't be having to do that
B	I would hope not
A	no
B	and obviously you will not be doing ridiculous things like him like yesterday when he was like it's run a five minute mile and then he literally destroyed himself
A	no I won't have to do that
B	it's mad
A	death
B	Don't let them see you cry
A	want to kill yourself more or less every day
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	turns out they don't like that
A	not turns out I'm not sure I'll be able to hold that but
B	iron your bed at night
A	if they seriously do that I'm just going to laugh
B	that's what they did
A	that's the problem
B	they ironed their beds
A	like if I have to go on with the kids if I have to go in with the kids I'm not going to take it seriously
B	yeah I know
A	they'll be shitting themselves and I'll be like are you taking the piss?
B	have you been in the real world?
A	yeah like eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six
B	do they pit you all in together then people going in as an officer and people going into
A	no
B	oh good okay
A	so that's a bit more
B	that's more bearable
A	yeah
B	hilarious
A	no so when I said this he was like oh right and then twelve weeks training so
B	and I said yeah and then you get to come and see my pass out parade
A	and he was like oh yeah I could
B	yeah I can just see that you maniac
A	like the photograph you have for your graduation except that I'm bikinied
B	em I think they'd take it pretty seriously
A	I mean I don't think I'm going to tell them hat at the interview
B	I plan on just wearing a bikini
A	yeah
B	I mean you say this now but I think you've forgotten how fucking cold it is when it's minus one
A	match the hat
B	match the hat yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	probably didn't think that through far enough did I?
B	mm well it's a plan
A	my eyes feel really dry like there's no eye juice in them
B	keep blinking
A	it's like a rave
B	yeah disco disco
A	I really don't want to go to work tomorrow
B	mm
A	ah Ed was saying we had an Apple conference in last week
B	really?
A	and they said you know we we very rarely do recruitment event co we just head hunt people
B	really
A	twenty okay well we can offer twenty-one would you leave?
B	nice and is he owing time
A	in the shop I think it's just a sales assistant job
B	oh okay
A	well yeah yeah
B	so that's pretty awesome
A	but em yeah once you're in Apple apparently it's quite difficult get promoted
B	mm mm
A	yeah wouldn't it?
B	oh that's pretty exciting though
A	mm
B	we had em we had an email come round
A	yeah I love that
B	so that's nice that's you know fluid
A	A bit mental
B	nobody would go and talk to them cos they do their own secret thing so
A	yeah
B	yeah it's cos ESOL an just do what they like because we we need them
A	nice
B	but can we still use your
A	I was talking to somebody from
B	oh nice
A	his name's
B	ah
A	but we call him in the office and I call him eh
B	yeah I don't know what he looks like
A	well yeah that's what I mean
B	definitely going to look him up in connections tomorrow
A	what the fuck? Seriously?
B	yeah yeah she's going to go and
A	how the hell did that happen?
B	create their publishing program in relation to the curriculum
A	which you hadn't deleted
B	yeah yeah cos everyone was like have you heard
A	yeah
B	well it's disgusting and it shouldn't be the case
A	yeah
B	so yeah it's really it's difficult
A	I think it's because men are  men are  easier at piggy backing
B	yeah absolutely
A	and I think women and less incline to do that
B	yeah well you you sort of you take a lot of responsibility on your own shoulders I think that's she difficulty
A	or if you're in a team you want to work with the team not use the team
B	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
A	and see even above the top line
B	he could draw a line
A	yeah and I think  I think  girls naturally find it more difficult cos you don't
B	yeah yeah absolutely
A	oh my god
B	mm
A	and before I left I was trying to encourage him to retain to work on his retention but he just he don't
B	yeah
A	he's like yeah okay so we should do that and then I said okay encouraging people even just to leave their information if I put if I write some things to go on like a guide to  a guide to  translation or guide to search engine optimisation but in a foreign language
B	yeah
A	well usually people don't know that exists
B	okay
A	they charge you I think it's like five per cent of the unit price for any words that are repeated
B	oh god
A	as is as if he's done it?
B	really?
A	and he's edited some of it relay poorly and the font
B	nice
A	and it it's all wonky like I don't
B	have they got a copy writer in to do it or would they just have done it themselves
A	published it themselves
B	urgh
A	but we do have a typesetter
B	Jesus
A	but yeah as his own not even accredited or nothing
B	yeah not even a message to say
A	yeah
B	oh right its actually the text that you left
A	I'd written everything
B	oh god yeah
A	and he's taken part of one and part of the other and moshed it together and it's bad
B	ah
A	yeah but I was like what the fuck?
B	yeah
A	gutted
B	that's shitty that's absolutely shitty
A	yeah and you can see the difference because I on the website from ages ago when I was there
B	yeah
A	there is something still written that says my by
B	yeah
A	and you can see the difference between the two levels of English
B	that's so shitty
B	em I'm getting a yoghurt
A	are you?
B	do you want one?
A	well I thought I did and then I thought I might want some Fish Food

B	bent the spoon
A	trying to get the ice-cream out
B	oh well
A	I was telling everyone at work about this ice cream today
B	it's pretty good
A	I think it's the best thing I ever tasted under five per cent fat

A	I don't think that's the
B	you don't think that's the thing? Does that not look familiar
A	no no it doesn't
B	that's the thing that's the thing

B	not vagina centre
A	remind me while we're there to ask them if they've got ropes
B	what?
A	ropes
B	oh you've got to climb the rope yeah
A	I think you probably wanted the sport centre bit
B	ah look at that man getting a good feel on
A	yeah
B	dirty boy
A	know your game
B	yeah know what you're about
A	I think we have to be a member to go to the thermal spa
B	but we are members we have cards
A	oh does that make us members?
B	probably not
A	oh my god I haven't looked from my card
B	opening times
A	mm hm

A	eh yes
B	okay oh no it's downloading something
A	it's going to open a PDF
B	does it open on my phone?
A	mm hm
B	complete thing go
A	that's it scroll down
B	now but be de be
A	yeah I would have thought so
B	yeah because we'll already have it on
A	yeah
B	yeah chuck them in
A	and jump in
B	jump in the pool
A	for swimming yeah
B	Cos they cos men are disgusting
A	yeah
B	fifty plus I need to go to that
A	which by the way is ageist
B	adult lane
A	porn lanes
B	porn lane
A	eh yeah
B	it's em I don't know
A	going to go with yeah
B	em
A	although I haven't looked for my card
B	you never have your card
A	I know
B	yeah
A	for forgetting it
B	they think you're ditzy
A	what the hell is it? I wonder if it's down the side of the bed? I thought I'd left it
B	it's probably in the bed
A	Earthier is that
B	you know this now
A	but I remember last time I had it was when I went swimming and I don't remember taking it back out of my bag but it's certainly not in there now
B	mm
A	they'll make me buy another card
B	maybe they'll just shoot you
A	I think that might be the option
B	you know that Norwegian guy that killed seventy-seven people last year
A	yeah
B	they found him sane
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	he killed them all because he thought they were all potential terrorists? Ah that's
B	he was on a crusade
A	wow that sounds usual
B	yeah
A	no
B	how can one one lots of people say yeah he's fucking insane
A	fucking crazy
B	and others are like no
A	he's fine
B	sound as a penny
A	they don't do that do they?
B	I hope not
A	mm
B	ah
A	oh so the crazy person says he's not crazy he says he's a political activist
B	the crazy person thinks that it would be worse to send you to a psychiatric ward
A	well I suppose they would drug you all the time and keep you in under
B	and but he refers to himself as a political activist
A	although I think I would quite enjoyed being sedated for a little while
B	em
A	think how relaxed it would be
B	yeah I mean who need is a brain
A	I often think that I should have lobotomy
B	just put it in a jar or something
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah you can
A	playing scenarios
B	maybe not a lobotomy maybe an on off switch
A	mm
B	just a bit messy I think bit fiddle some
A	mm
B	and they're attaching like you know nerve endings and stuff
A	mm
B	I mean unless we all you know have medical degrees
A	or that crazy guy we watched the other day
B	man my abs today are really killing me
A	you managed to do ten real press ups?
B	yeah
A	I really want to try après up but I'm a bit scared now

A	fishing game? Ah
B	on the rowing
A	hang on a second you actually have a game
B	on the rowing machine it's called go fish
A	no
B	you'd think it would be really fun but it's shit
A	yeah
B	basically what happens is the more the
A	oh
B	but I it's quite it takes your mind off the fact that you're rowing cos that's fucking boring let's be honest
A	yeah I don't have that game
B	it's a really good work out

B	no way
