A	yeah exactly
B	like
A	yeah
B	it gets quite like
A	yeah
B	once I get my contract through I'll be like

B	a few times you just look at jobs and like oh I could
A	I love looking at jobs I'm so bad at it like
B	I do
A	yeah
B	and like
A	exactly
B	and base it around that
A	and what you're worth yeah
B	like yeah and I haven't got that much experience but
A	still two years' is okay and there's still a grad scheme so
B	yeah
A	you know they've given you a bit more responsibility than somebody starting off at the bottom haven't they?
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	oh shall I move to London? oh I don't know

A	thank you
B	thank you
unknown_female	thank you
B	thank you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the thing is we've already over the last four months been merging with production so my job has now changed fifty percent anyway
B	yeah
A	so I've gained another fifty percent extra work
B	yeah
A	so
B	it's not the best but it isn't bad
A	so now they're like having another restructure it's fine like I'm not worried about it I don't think they're not gonna make us redundant
B	yeah
A	but you'd really want them to like
B	yes but I most places don't they're like
A	no
B	they're like oh you know they're in the they're not gonna leave
A	yeah exactly
B	and some you know some people were making a fuss and like I'm not getting what I need but
A	yeah
B	most people
A	no
B	so like our company say ah you know we'll
A	but they're not
B	but ours is probably like everyone knows we get paid less than people around here you know for a Midlands business
A	yeah
B	they don't change it you'll get more you'll just get inflation every year and like
A	yeah
B	no
A	no yeah
A	but you obviously save a hell of a lot more than most people because you can live at home
B	mm
unknown_female	your water
B	thank you thank you
unknown_female	and a Diet Coke?
unknown_female	jug for you thank you
B	but it's just yeah that's what I think I would make if I had to
A	you'd suddenly realise how expensive it is yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	then you've got council tax and you've got bills and you've got travel and you know and it's just
B	travel
A	yeah in London like at lunchtime so I go out all
B	in places
A	if ever I'm in London for the day I have like a coffee in the morning
B	mm
A	and I have lunch out I have a coffee on the way home it's really like and it's just so completely cos it's just
B	and it's just so convenient cos it's just there and you're not having time for it
A	and it's like
B	yeah
A	that's two a day it's like six quid six times five is thirty that's thirty pounds a week on coffee
B	mm
A	like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you know like like you'll you get I think you'll probably realise that it's like I need to take them home but
A	yeah
B	you you do in the end so I'm spending like
A	yeah
B	so like a hundred pounds a month then I was like yeah
A	yeah
B	but you
A	eating out in
B	it's good though
A	but then
B	so when you see a statement you're like
A	yeah
B	oh oh all my money is basically food I can't I can either go home
A	yeah
B	but if I was paying like fifty quid for like return tickets for like erm
A	no
B	I need to like
A	how much was your ticket here today?
B	eight pound
A	it's so good isn't it? it's so good
B	or was it like eighty or something for a day return I thought it was gonna be more expensive
A	that's ridiculously cheap
A	yeah
B	but it's on my rail card as well so I think it must be
A	yeah
B	about twelve quid or something
A	I've got a rail card as well
B	I mean it'll last another
A	yeah twenty-five isn't it?
B	I got three
A	I've gotta get it
B	I got it last year
A	I'm getting another one next year
B	and that's it
A	twenty-five tell me about it
B	I think that would be a reality check like
A	I know I'm a twenty-five-year-old what happens? I don't feel like an adult at the moment so
A	mm
B	I always look at the the houses there for sale they're like still can't afford to buy anything
A	no it's ridiculous
B	until you know exactly where you wanna live
A	yeah
B	so much time travelling to work travelling home then you don't have a life
A	exactly
B	I don't want that lifestyle it's like I finish at a decent time
A	yeah
B	cycle to work
A	that's why I like I really like the industry I'm in I get into work at half past seven I leave between half past three and four o'clock
B	that is amazing that's perfect
A	I beat all the traffic I
B	kind of have a whole day kind of
A	yeah like I live
B	that's amazing
A	like half an hour away from work
B	yeah
A	but
B	mm
A	in terms of miles it's like ten miles away
B	that's not bad
A	erm
B	mm
A	really really easy and
B	mm
A	yeah and I enjoy it like that's the problem with like considering the industry isn't the most well paid I have an amazing work-life balance
B	yeah it's what you need more it's like what do you do with more money that you can't spend?
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	and it's just you're shattered all the time or
A	exactly
B	you know go out do other things
A	and I I've done so much like I go for weekends on holiday I go to I went to London to see The Book of Mormon last week
B	is it good? I wanted to go and see it last time
A	so funny
B	what did I go and see instead? I went to see erm
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	and they were they were still far at the back and stuff well you could see everything but it wasn't you know close
B	oh yeah
B	I'm in London for I'm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	definitely have a look
B	like
A	mm
B	probably yeah I was gonna go
A	yeah
B	three day it's like intense
A	er
B	course
A	yeah I can imagine
B	like it'll be good like
A	oh yeah
B	like I'm looking forward to
A	I mean you get free lunches and stuff don't you but?
B	breakfast lunch and dinner I get so
A	but then it
B	so I'll
B	but I've done like internal courses and stuff but like ones that
A	yeah
B	but I've not been on one on my own
A	yeah
B	I think they were waiting till they they knew we were like
A	staying yeah
B	spend that money on us
A	cos
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I didn't say that you know you just don't wanna go too far and be like
A	do you have expenses so like you were you can claim it back?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	I love London though
A	and even just staying in a hotel and having like a hotel lunch or breakfast and stuff you're like oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	a few nights which
A	yeah exactly
B	and then I'll be like oh
A	seriously love London
B	first week of December
A	yeah I'll
B	definitely but I'm in London
A	really quick and easy to get to
B	but mm I might be in London till Sunday night as well if I'm got everything
A	yeah
B	if I'm there
A	but definitely if you try and go to Book of Mormon it is hilarious
B	yes
A	I loved it so much
B	I love shows though
A	me too I think even if I go to the theatre I don't
B	yeah
A	still
B	yeah
A	I wanna see Matilda
B	but
A	yeah
A	exactly
B	Matilda and
A	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is supposed to be good
B	yeah
A	but I haven't seen it it doesn't it doesn't appeal to me overly I didn't particularly like the story but
B	mm
A	Matilda sounds good
A	everybody says Wicked's so good but I've never seen it
B	it's literally like
A	oh really?
B	just because I didn't really know the
A	yeah
B	but just obviously
A	yeah
B	but that one's kind of the story of
A	yeah
B	and her
A	from The Wizard of Oz yeah
B	and
A	oh The Sound of Music one yeah
A	Matt Willis?
B	Matt Willis
A	oh really?
B	and it's really quite good they have like a
A	mm
B	definitely worth a watch
A	yeah I'd really I'd like to see Wicked everybody raves about it and surprisingly the prices aren't overly expensive are they to see Wicked?
B	not too bad
A	yeah
B	and that was in the stalls as well but that was about three years ago
A	lovely yeah
B	but you might have to go like midweek to get
A	yeah
B	get midweek or
A	but see Book of Mormon was sixty pounds each per ticket
B	mm
A	and we were on the second-to
B	oh yeah
A	and er we still see everything but
B	it's only bad when someone in front of you is tall
A	tall yeah
B	and you kind of just sit on something with
A	yeah the seats aren't at an angle they're not high enough are they? they don't go up high enough in the chair
B	no
A	no
B	and I always hate that my body is
A	and it's really sad like there was a girl who
B	ah so
A	yeah
B	yeah people like
A	try and do something like
B	even like I kind of go down on the seat a bit so someone
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and you're just like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like
A	and if someone said oh excuse me do you mind if you tie your hair up? I bet she had a massive go at them
B	it's like yeah
B	oh yeah
A	if I'd paid a hundred and fifty quid and someone like that sat in front of me I'd be like
B	you'd be so annoyed it's like
A	yeah
B	when I went to see Beyoncé
A	yeah
B	a few years ago
A	yeah
B	I couldn't see her on the stage
A	but I can't see her
B	spent like sixty-seventy quid on the ticket
A	yeah
B	so when I stood outside for like twelve hours in a day
A	oh yeah
A	like
B	oh yeah I remember you saying
A	and he was brilliant
B	mm
A	but we stood we were standing for
A	hours and by like walking home we were in so much pain
B	mm
A	and like
B	no
A	yeah
B	but then like now
A	yeah
B	but I am going to
A	oh yeah
B	and my friends like them and
A	yeah
B	said yeah and then I was like
A	yeah
B	I'm regretting it now
A	yeah
B	like I wanna go
A	Gabriella Aplin is performing actually
B	oh that's good
A	and I really like her
B	mm
A	so I might go and see her
B	yeah
A	she's not very well known so no one else really knows who she is
B	I know her yeah
A	so well if you wanna go see Gabriella Aplin then
B	oh yeah
A	yeah I'll send you the link it's it seems really nice
B	mm
A	her songs are just they're nice they're just nice songs aren't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	some of them they kinda get to your
A	yeah
B	but
A	she's performing in Nottingham so
B	mm
A	I want I really want to see her I've liked her for a long time but
B	yeah
A	yeah I'm not a massive gig person I don't
B	no
A	I can't actually tell you
A	see I wouldn't count that as a gig I'd count that as a concert like
A	you know like
B	I've been to that Vaccines one a proper gig like literally like people stand close to you and like
A	exactly
B	raving in front of you
A	I've never been to a proper gig
B	that's probably the only one I'll go to
A	yeah
B	yeah I don't think I've been to anyone else but
A	yeah
B	sometimes they're not that good live
A	yeah
B	and some people aren't good live are they?
A	it's like my friend
B	oh yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	cos like you have to take money obviously for the weekend
B	yeah and food and all that stuff
A	and I was like did you have a good time? and she was like yeah it was alright
B	I hate it when people say that like oh I was lashed the whole time
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then she suddenly decided to pay another three hundred quid to go to Glastonbury I was like
B	why?
A	but you didn't particularly enjoy Bestival
B	that's
A	I do yeah I know I could go on holiday for that
B	exactly
A	I will go on holiday for three hundred and fifty quid easily
B	I just think that
A	yeah
B	at the end oh I it's like oh I it's like oh I think I had a good night
A	yeah
B	it's like how do you know if it is?
A	erm at the end of November I'm going to Naples with
B	it's nice
A	ninety-nine pounds
B	that is amazing
A	flights hotel breakfast with the hotel
B	that is so good
A	and a free cocktail on arrival
B	that is a bargain like
A	like
B	I am with you there I love travelling the world like
A	I kid you not like
B	I
A	yeah
B	and
A	like
B	mm mm
A	like I'm going to Naples for nineteen ninety-nine pounds that was through Secret Escapes I'm going to Bratislava  at the beginning of November for a hundred and twenty-nine pounds
B	that's good
A	and that's for four days
B	that's good I need to get more breaks I definitely need to
B	oh okay
A	yeah
B	you have more breaks than having one holiday in like
A	exactly
B	and then you feel like oh it's like three months ago it's too far away
B	yeah
A	three or four days
B	yeah
A	the flights are organised the hotel there's no hassle you literally turn up and go and then that's done
B	mm
A	and like
B	you don't have to think about where where I'm gonna stay what I'm gonna do
A	no
B	all you think about yeah
A	like like the dinners when you get there
B	yeah
A	like everything else is fine
B	that's a good idea
A	and like in when we go to Naples we're gonna go to Pompeii so that's the only thing we have to organise like everything else
B	good
A	yeah I heard that
B	it's literally like the ticket
A	yeah
