A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean I know we've nearly done
B	mind you we've nearly done two

B	unless the
A	talking a year and a half away
B	yeah
A	but if we do that you know we don't have to leave

A	quite negative isn't it?
B	no
A	bounce through a few books?
B	yeah you
A	float?
B	I don't know
A	flutter?
B	yeah
A	through work don't you?
B	yeah and that's not a very good
A	okay
B	no that means
A	no but then
B	you're not gonna read them half half of them
A	okay
B	choose your words wisely
B	I was I was trying
B	I really was I was picking up little bits and bobs
A	no it's
B	and erm
A	quite interesting
B	but
A	it's that basically
B	and she loved it
A	what happens
B	it's I can't get out now I couldn't get in before
A	after the Second World War and so Japan and Germany won the war
B	right
A	and Germany's taken control of the
B	are you coming in here?
A	and then the central America like centre of the United States is like a
B	so that's
A	it's like a neutral
B	that's more in the west isn't it?
A	well
B	slightly
A	I don't know
B	yeah a little bit I think
A	well I'm only on the first chapter
B	yeah
A	but I just remember from what
B	I thought the whole point was that
A	no the the Nazis have won they but they
B	the Nazis have won
A	they've all gone a bit a nuts I think and
B	okay
A	they've wiped out everyone in Africa
B	yeah okay
A	erm
B	keep your hat on
A	about a guy who's writing a book like a fantasy book to try and escape like the
B	what a story within a story?
A	no he's gonna write a story about imagining if the allied forces er had won the war
B	oh
A	but he's in an alternate dimension where Germany and Japan had won the war
B	oh okay
A	so it's all about him writing this imaginary like dimension where the opposite had won the war?
B	so I wonder how many
A	yeah quite a few I should think but it's I mean I can tell by the first chapter it's quite a dystopian view
B	yeah
A	and I think that's might be one of the questions that are raised I dunno
B	yeah
A	I mean are we just gonna go back then? cos it's pretty cold
B	yeah it is pretty cold to be walking around
B	what button?
B	the same guy look
A	no a different bloke
B	oh
A	cos they all look the same
B	walnuts?

B	come in and sit that exam for them
A	yeah yeah totally
B	they'd just take their own
A	anyone could
B	yeah let's not tell them that
A	no
B	okay dystopian view
