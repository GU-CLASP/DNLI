A	uh just remember a chimpanzee doing a memory test really fast
B	that's right
A	and yeah now that looked interesting but
B	stupid football match
A	it nearly went to penalties
B	I know
A	I hate penalties
B	I know
A	um
B	it kinda unfair isn't it? But then again I suppose it has to come to an end at some point
A	they were getting pretty tired towards the end
B	maybe it should just be a fight to the death
A	hm
B	yeah until they just drop down on their knees to
A	or
B	no I mean carry on the
A	well oh right want
B	so it'd be like seven hundred minutes on the clock you know?
A	they're just sort of they're lying on the floor and they're crawling
B	yeah
A	they're trying to crawl it in the net and stuff
B	yeah
A	sort of heading it along the ground?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that I'd pay for you know
A	well no it's very  it's very  exhausting though I imagine
B	yeah I know but they get
A	I never played ninety minutes but
B	if somebody gave me two hundred fifty thousand pounds a week I'd run around all you want
B	it's like buying a house every week
A	you have to put in a lot of effort you know all the
B	you could buy a house every single week like
A	gotta spend so much time you know and just
B	yeah but that's crazy
A	you were practising in the street and everything
B	but that's
A	yeah
B	uh
A	um
B	sweet potatoes I said
A	yeah save the sweet potatoes
B	oh right
A	uh
B	oh they are
A	like worry balls
A	uh butternut squash and two worry balls
A	yeah
B	they needed eating didn't they?
A	yeah
B	was gonna have the
A	what?
B	get some pizza or something really naughty
A	have you now? D'you mean a proper one or or the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	what? Oh yeah
A	yep
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	D'you wanna go out tomorrow night then or or the Saturday?
A	um
B	I suppose we shouldn't go too crazy
A	um
B	yeah
A	that was quite good but uh it's also good on the Saturday as well so
B	which one's better?
A	um
B	there's only one way to find out
A	which one  Which one  would you prefer?
B	I think I like Friday because it feels like
A	yeah
B	before I even realize
A	yeah
B	if we go out to the pub or something then at least like it keeps you sort of from nodding off or anything
A	yeah um
B	and then also because like the next day feels like it should be Sunday but actually it's only Saturday
A	but uh
A	Cos uh Friday feels
B	so if we did have a bank holiday and I went out on a Friday then it would be like a double bank holiday
A	um
B	nothing happens in February
A	it's it's Good Friday
B	no Friday is
A	um
B	I think it is
A	yeah
B	I know yeah
A	uh and uh buy some
B	well I might buy that one of those ones that I sent you the link to
A	yeah
B	be a good use for that free Amazon voucher though like
A	well that was really good that you  that you  got that with sort of like
B	I really didn't expect it to materialize
A	A free hundred hundred quid of  hundred quid of  stuff
B	you always think things like that are just a scam you know what I mean? Well I do anyway
A	yeah
B	give us that pan there
A	yeah I would be a little bit cynical about it yeah
B	mm put that lid on
A	it's taking a while
B	I know
B	oh bless you
A	uh so yeah we'll be we'll try and go to uh to
B	I like
A	oh yeah um
B	that was the
A	they said it's very hot so you've gotta watch out for it but I
B	yeah maybe
A	yeah
B	speaking of which d'you want anything any chillies chopping for in there
A	I just chopped some of them little dried red ones um
B	oh right
A	I didn't uh
B	oh it'll be nice won't it when the chilli plants are out again
A	yeah that one I dunno uh it looks pretty dead doesn't it
B	have you watered it recently?
A	yeah
B	oh have you? Oh
A	it was quite dry though
B	what about the other ones? Did you water this one?
A	yeah I watered both of them yeah that's the bell pepper isn't it? But there's there's we've got tomatoes still with snow on them We've got
B	I know
A	tomatoes with fruit and uh
B	I think they're dead though
A	you know left over but uh
B	but I think they went to twigs like this last year
A	yeah
B	and then just in the Spring once it got warmer it sort of came back to life but
A	the funny thing is that it is warm for the plant isn't it?
B	but is it not about the sunlight? Is it not about like the the hours of sunlight and not?
A	I dunno
B	Cos in here yeah it is warm inside
A	till the we've put it in the corner yeah maybe it's not
B	yeah it's not even getting any light so
A	something's not happening in the corner maybe
B	yeah maybe
A	well they they they they would progress slower in less light wouldn't they?
B	yeah
A	um
B	maybe it needs like a kick start like a blast of
A	can you chop that for?
B	yeah
A	ay?
B	I wish I'd cleared that snow when when it first started
A	yeah it is it's gone all frozen and um it's harder
B	but it was snowing when I came in you know?
A	well it's sort of slippery
B	it was snowing when I came in
A	was it?
B	yeah
A	well I hope we get out of this cold snap
B	let me see what it is now
A	so is the new snow settling?
B	no it wasn't like very much it was like just a few flakes
A	yeah
B	it's not doesn't seem to be snowing at the moment but the sky was
A	yeah
B	but the garden's really bad like the bike's really hard to get out cos
A	yeah
B	stupid
A	oh yeah yeah
B	well other than the side roads
A	they were just sort of wet in the middle but not
B	oh there was drama today at work
A	oh really?
B	so um there was like a guy
A	what kind of drama?
B	well
B	and pointing
A	A heron
B	like heron like you know
A	getting sort of
B	D'you remember from um animals of farthing wood
A	they're
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	well
B	waving me knife around
A	yeah yeah
B	one of them
A	and it was just sort of swooping over was it?
B	it'd
B	so I don't know
A	yeah there's a lot of sort of like species and like loads of trees loads of
B	yeah
A	plants and water birds and things going around here
B	but
A	they're pretty big
B	um but we've got like a like carp and stuff in
A	them sorts of birds
B	I imagine
A	so it's technically a pest
B	well
A	yeah
B	and there was like police and stuff all over and um this van
A	right
B	this van um like a grey van and they had the doors open and stuff and like policemen were looking in it and that and
A	fair enough
B	apparently what'd happened this van'd come pulled up at work
A	right so they tried to break then yeah?
B	and they'd got in the building
A	just just managed to get in but actually didn't that happen earlier as well?
B	yeah stuff was stolen once
A	yeah so they've they've broken in in the daytime what time was this?
B	at lunchtime they've just driven in
B	yeah parked up walked in
A	parked up opened the door
B	and then I don't know
A	hm
B	so yeah
A	your guards are gonna have to watch your uh
B	considerably more drama than
A	you're gonna have to close your gate
B	considerably more drama than usual though
A	yeah
B	so
A	well in some ways that's good actually
B	yeah I suppose
A	you know getting through
B	no but everyone likes bit gossip
A	moving things forward
B	move those tomatoes
A	thyme tastes weird in here
B	what?
A	thyme I put some thyme in
B	oh well
A	into these amongst these curry spices and it tastes a bit sort of weird but uh
B	I know but once that goes
A	but I'll just get you know get used to it
B	well once it goes in there though
A	so we just need some uh more uh juice and more sweeties
B	with the potatoes
A	and uh
B	I just got a
A	puree saves having to put a whole tin of tomatoes in
B	I know
A	uh and and getting
B	you're a big fan of that now aren't you? Oh you've dropped it
A	getting uh
B	yeah
A	um
B	but yeah so that was dramatic
A	yeah I mean so you don't know anything? So you just
B	no
A	I mean didn't didn't anyone say anything else?
B	no
A	so what did you what did
B	um
A	yeah
B	I don't know if he spotted it or someone spotted it and then
A	yeah
B	hang on I think like they um
A	drive in and take stuff and then drive away again? Yeah
B	yeah exactly so
A	well
B	well put them in there
A	oh yeah could actually
B	May as well
A	um
B	oops
A	yep
A	these ones uh these ones go to eleven
A	why don't you just make ten more powerful?
A	like
B	that was on the other night wasn't it?
A	it's on well it's on a lot isn't it?
B	shall I stir it in?
A	um cos it's made by some people who've you know been purchased or something's been purchased
B	ah that's been on loads of times uh Free Willy Free Willy Two
A	how did he get back into captivity then?
B	I dunno
A	they spent all that effort getting him free and then just
B	I dunno I haven't watched it for about eighteen years or something
A	how d'you know he was gone cos he he was free like in
B	but apparently I'm sure there were some stories surrounding
A	wouldn't he?
B	I feel like this sounds a bit like me
A	that that story turned out to be true didn't it?
B	well I'm sure this one might be
A	sort of half true like
B	I'm sure that um the actual whale that was
B	that was Willy in Free Willy like ate somebody or did something
B	no I think after
A	it's one of
A	yeah it's it's
B	free Will Two
A	well once you've  once you've  got
B	free Willy Two The Adventure Home
A	if a film's successful no matter how bad it is or silly or whatever you know bizarre well they'll just
A	they'll just wanna keep making them you know No matter how how little it needed to be
B	cast
B	keiko the author or something
A	so is there  is there  some kind of statistic of like most murders committed by an actor? Um
B	you mean a whale
A	most
B	he's got
A	no I mean Wikipedia's
B	and then it's like Sex
A	oh so he's a Scandinavian sort of Nordic whale
B	died in two thousand and three in Norway aged twenty-seven
A	oh it died did it?
B	he's a male actor
B	he was captured near Iceland
A	mind you if he'd been swimming round Iceland he might've got himself uh got himself whaled
B	yeah
A	blubber or whale meat
B	oh I think they were still really hunted yeah
A	but
B	uh
A	residence
B	oh yeah look
A	oh right so there's a real foundation? He died  He died  though
B	yeah he beached himself
A	whales isn't it the beaching
B	maybe he didn't kill anyone maybe I was just slander
A	maybe it was another
B	he was a orca
A	what about that chimp that attacked that woman in uh America?
B	yeah but like that guy said on
A	Travis the chimp
B	oh that's bad
A	maybe maybe he was an actor when he was younger
B	that's bad though like all of those
A	I guess it depends on
B	exactly yeah
A	um saw on Room 101 uh Chris Packham
B	he's weird isn't he?
A	he uh sort of revealed himself to be quite different and it's quite interesting how a couple of celebrities I've seen on Room 101 the new one with Frank Skinner
B	yeah
A	I saw
A	remember and Chris Packham revealed himself to be quite a lot more sort of angry about things than than I ever thought you know a a conservationist would would be
B	what did he wanna put in again? Something like children's art that's right
A	I think he nominated  he nominated  humanity
B	children
A	he did he nominated
A	yeah he nominated humanity
B	that's stupid that's so annoying
A	but Frank Skinner chose not to put humanity into Room 101
B	well
A	uh
B	yeah
A	and you can't really only do as well
B	can't just put people from Liverpool in
A	not
B	no
A	they sort of exaggerate their their Liverpoolness that he so called
B	are they Scousers?
A	and he he
B	yeah
A	people who sort of exaggerate where they're from
B	think I would put in like
A	uh some
B	I I think I would put in uh the bottom of cereal box
A	um
B	you know like when you get to the end of your fruit and fibre? And then you pour it in your bowl? And it's just horrible and like ugh mushy
A	yeah
B	I'd put that in
A	um
B	I'd put in going to the toilet and then having a wee and then realizing that there's no loo roll
A	yeah I
B	that's bad
A	well they normally put like more like a noun
B	yeah like dogs or something
A	yeah like like you could you would just rephrase it and say toilet
B	I don't really like dogs
A	could put pub toilets into Room 101
B	yeah
A	that'd be pretty good but then they'd say well we
B	falling over in public
A	I'm sorry? Falling over in public?
B	no matter how much you've hurt yourself you're like I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine stop looking at me
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um
A	like like you can't put like cancer into Room 101 or something
B	okay fine
A	um
B	yeah
A	people who are always on uh smartphones all the time when when when you're trying to have a conversation in a pub
B	can I have that bit and see what it's like?
A	yeah
B	ooh it's nice
A	it tastes
B	is that chicken or not turkey?
A	I don't know
B	Cos I just shoved them in together
A	I think it's turkey actually from looking at the sort of  looking at the sort of  grain of it there
B	yeah
B	people who don't pick up dog poo
A	thinking of I don't like train spotters I think
B	train spotters are harmless
A	like dogs
B	yeah
A	like just just being misanthropic to some extent like uh
B	yeah
A	uh pets or something like sort of a bit more sort of miserable
B	I don't really like pets yeah
A	I don't like pets or something uh sort of yeah grumpy old man style
B	or like cheapy bin bags
B	that's quite annoying
A	it is yeah
B	I dunno if I'd put it in Room 101
A	it's not not a massive like yeah
B	my my cereal one's my my bugbear
A	bugbears
B	yeah
A	uh
B	no I don't mind the sticky floor
B	better than like a wine bar
A	yeah
B	I'd rather like a pub or a bar that was like a bit
A	um
B	nice and cheap
A	uh good toilets
B	Good toilets
A	one of the most important aspects of the pub
A	some of the pubs round even in nice places like
B	I know
B	horrible isn't it?
A	but um
B	yeah
A	uh good atmosphere with a bit of good music
B	mhm
A	I don't like ones that don't have music in
B	no that's true
A	where they've cranked up the air conditioning
B	I was so cold on Saturday
A	yeah
B	and like that other the other one as well that when they want you to leave they just open the door and let the icy
B	ah I just got a shock I think
A	sorry
B	yeah
A	I got I burnt  I burnt  and then reacted and knocked that onto you
B	it's alright don't worry
A	A bit stupid
B	that'll probably need some more like spices and stuff in
A	something like um
B	well
A	quite nice actually
B	can I have a spoon
A	I mean quite nice in fact
A	but um
B	what if they all mean the same thing
B	can I have a spoon?
A	um
B	just in there just
B	what temperature was that it's quite bubbly?
A	that was on like six or seven or something
B	ah it is tasty
A	and it turns out these uh these Lamonas are a lot actually
B	the what?
A	lamonas are actually
B	uh uh
A	sorry what did you say? Cos the hob and the the washing machine are can't them they've
B	ah right
A	but they didn't  they didn't  make it
B	oh I see
A	oh yeah well no I just thought cos it's like a washing machine or whatever
B	yeah
A	didn't be you know made by
B	some chilli maybe
A	um
B	some yoghurt maybe?
A	paste flavouring
B	I put it in before and it didn't do that though
A	that's uh
B	oh right
A	uh towards the end and then I'll put some chilli in
B	right
A	uh
B	yeah we should go to the spice man and buy some more
B	ah maybe not Scotch bonnets but uh
A	deadly
B	oh that
A	uh it was called
B	well
A	for the BBC uh
B	no that
A	just going round different parts of the world and basically
B	D'you not think they totally maximize it though like? D'you not think they will like oh when they pitch it they're like oh I'm gonna make this programme about whatever on insects
B	history of all of the best places in the world
A	where I'm gonna need to really know all of the places
B	I need to Canada
A	um New Zealand
B	yeah Australia
A	Galapagos
B	trans-Siberian Express
A	they filmed them little them horseshoe crabs that just look quite freaky little
B	that was in like
A	that was like
B	what was that programme called?
A	I don't know
B	what an idiot
A	uh and he did eat a whole Scotch bonnet
B	it is really painful
A	like he
B	ugh
A	I know they cure you know you're supposed to drink dairy products like you know milk or yoghurt
B	yeah
A	uh them Scotch bonnets are so strong you know the pain will it really gets into almost like inside your head like you can feel your head like you've got a hot head
B	it's horrible
A	do we need any more ingredients in this thing? Apart from the yoghurt?
B	uh I don't know
A	we've got a bit of oil left over there so
B	D'you wanna put some of like?
B	yeah
A	just uh
B	yeah put some of that in

A	oh yeah yeah they don't all do that uh
B	it's really nice
A	really
B	right
A	um
B	I'm really glad that I bought this
A	so we'll just wait for it to stew
B	okay
A	could put an aniseed in but I I know you're a bit like aniseed's a bit like
B	no cos the
B	it's not like sweet wood it's
A	who wouldn't want sweet wood?
B	maybe what we could do is like just put the yoghurt on the top when we have it rather than mix it in
A	ay?
B	what we could do is like just put a bit of yoghurt on the top when we have it rather than mix it in
A	yeah you can
B	yeah put the lid there
A	Curdles and uh
B	I'll one day I'll come home and you'll have  you'll have  like a power drill and you'll have put like a mixer round the end and you'll be in the bath with like a
A	I'd like to get um
B	A what?
A	A multimeter?

A	yeah you do it's it's an electrical measuring device
B	A multitier?
A	oh multimeter
B	ah
A	yeah? Aye?
B	no you mean like to
A	yeah but it doesn't just measure volts hence the multi
B	no
A	suppose you could call it nmeter if you want it to be sort of mathematical
A	ay?
B	me dad just calls it a voltmeter
A	Voltmeter
B	Don't take the mickey
A	no I was just saying that uh he probably didn't understand like the sound of that
B	I didn't know it was called the multimeter
A	yeah it's for testing components like say this dishwasher was broken or this washer dryer was broken
B	oh you have been doing a bit of
A	no I'm just saying like if if it was if it had a busted thermostat
B	uh-uh
A	you you you open up take out the thermostat test it with the multimeter
B	oh there you go
A	say if needs say if you need to
