B	not all artists do that
D	all the ones we've found out do
A	yeah

A	when we went to The Forum one
B	they
D	the Forum oh dear
A	mm
D	oh Gordon Bennett
A	that was
D	that was awful
C	yeah it's it's like who can come up with the best reason to explain it
D	yeah
C	some abstract fancy fluffy reasoning
D	that's right
B	and what the artist was thinking at the time of producing it
D	yeah
B	just loving it and looking at it
C	yeah
A	mm
C	like this plug represents emotion
D	yes
C	stopping the the flow of negative feeling
D	or I I would say it's rather sexual
D	you see don't you find a plug is rather sexual?
D	because it has to  it has to  be plugged in
A	they did they
D	they did didn't they
A	and they had um a load of artists competing to have space in the Versace gallery for a year or something
B	mm

C	mm
A	and a lot of money as well
D	yeah
A	and yeah someone came up with this just putting plugs in
D	yes
A	in a socket
C	yeah
A	how the plug going into the socket is so vital of the little parts of your life being plugged in at different times
C	that's what I mean you can just make anything up
D	you can make anything up yeah
C	you just have to say it with a posh accent and wave your arms about
B	yeah but to actually
D	you do yeah
A	he didn't even make these plugs
B	no he created some weird
D	no he
B	for people to look at
C	yeah well these people don't create anything do they
D	and they get somebody else to do it
C	and get someone else to do it yeah
D	yeah
A	or they'd just laid out a load of bricks hadn't they
C	hmm

A	yeah she did
C	Cos it was a beautiful thing but
A	that was  that was  it

D	I'll have that

A	yeah
D	yeah

A	mm
B	and there was another one when I was growing up there was that man holding the baby
D	yeah that's another one
B	and that was everywhere
A	we've got the clock
B	I've got the clock yeah
A	mm
B	but I remember some er all of my friends had some sort of image of that picture
A	mm
B	whether it be on a clock or on a poster
D	mm
B	that one image they made all sorts of products out of it
A	yeah
D	and that that image

A	it was very unusual then for men to be seen cuddling the babies
B	oh the man with the baby
D	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah it's before before men
D	but that image as it said on the television had him seduce three thousand women
A	no that didn't mean that
D	that did mean that
B	what? The man with the baby?
D	the picture that seduced three thousand women that was called
A	no
B	the man with the
D	the baby picture
A	oh

A	and bring it back
C	hmm
D	oh I didn't see that
B	ah
C	and he's become really famous now

C	yeah I'm sure there were
D	doing that
C	hmm
D	yeah
C	mm
B	well I was just thinking mum you've got a textile art picture of that photo up there haven't you? I think you should take three textiles because the tiger is a different style to the other types of textile art that you've done
A	yeah
B	so I think you should take three because then
D	she hasn't got one of that one up there
A	three?
B	yeah that's what  yeah that's what  thought
D	which one?
B	A
C	mm
A	that actually is one that I've been planning on doing
B	oh
A	Cos er I could see that in the velvet
B	yeah I can see that as textile
A	and that's why I did it that
B	mm
A	I think that'd be quite good
B	haven't you got a woodland textile art though?
A	mm
D	she sold the bluebell wood
B	oh you sold it
A	which everyone seems to want
D	yeah
B	so do some more woodland
A	oh
D	yeah
A	that was the first bit I've ever done
C	hmm
B	mm
A	so I was  I was  surprised at that
D	that's gonna be a beautiful day again look
B	well now that the fog has lifted
A	and the the girl who bought that
B	mm?
A	she's doing  she's doing  textiles at art college
D	yeah she's doing textiles at art college now
B	really?
A	yeah
D	she
B	because of your picture?
D	yeah
B	you inspired her?
A	well she bought it from us so
D	that weren't for sale when we put it into the art show
B	yeah
D	it was not for sale but she came up to us and asked us or asked
B	which?
A	so if we'd sell it to us after
D	after
B	how much did you sell it for?
A	A hundred
D	hundred and  hundred and
B	not enough
A	hundred
D	yeah hundred yeah
B	all of that work that you did
A	but if I'd have had to sell it at erm
D	oh well that was the first one that she'd ever sold
B	yeah
A	there it would have been a hundred and thirty
B	yeah
B	cool
D	I sold  I sold  one
A	just that's what she offered me
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	she said would that be enough
D	yeah
B	you should have said no not not enough
D	no
A	I was so ah
C	put another zero and that and you might be coming close
A	I was so taken aback
B	mm
D	I've sold several several photographs since though haven't we? You sold  you sold
D	oh yeah you sold yours didn't you
B	yeah your dad's the best customer
A	they are
C	you should give them a royalty card

A	they bought two
C	yeah
D	and and you sold one one to oh no that was  that was  the
A	welbourne Art was the last one
A	Down the road
D	down the road at
A	poultec
D	poultec centre
A	dad's were dad sold first
B	which one did you sell
D	I sold the Blue Sunset or something weren't it?
A	mm
B	see what I'm what I think because I was saying this to mum because you're selling these pictures but when you look at the picture on the wall you don't know who it's by
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	just in the corner of the frame
A	yeah the logo thing would be quite good but it's a bit complicated innit
D	yeah
B	so which so you sold which one?
D	I sold Blue Sunset
A	erm it's up in the
D	and then we sold The Shawl
A	it's up in the
D	we sold The Shawl
B	what's that one?
A	up in the guest room that one is the dad's one
D	which is a a walk it's a walk in Yorkshire
B	mm
D	where Queen Ann? I think that was Queen Ann wasn't it?
A	mm
D	well one of the queens was walking and lost her shawl
B	oh
A	queen Mary
D	queen Mary
A	scots queen
D	queen Mary
A	queen of Scots
D	queen of Scots
B	and it grew into a rock?
D	no she lost her shawl cos she was on she was running away from someone or something
A	yeah
B	oh
D	that is the legend anyway
A	mm so they call it The Shawl
B	oh
D	and they call the place The Shawl
A	mm
C	hmm
D	but that was
A	yeah I think so yeah
D	yeah
B	ah
A	we haven't sold many
B	but but you have sold a few that
D	sold a few yeah
B	like how many people can say they've sold their photos or their art work? It's lovely
D	yeah
A	mm
B	I know you've done quite a lot of exhibitions and stuff
A	well you've sold
B	as a  as a  card wasn't it
A	as a erm well you got eight pound for it didn't you
B	ah a little one yeah
C	hmm hm
D	yeah
B	ooh
A	what happens when you do different sizing though?
C	mm
B	it's still that photo
D	yeah that is still the photo
B	you have to say
C	and what happens if if like you sell ten
D	yeah
C	can you not er huh a way round it can you change it in Photoshop? Can it like a tiny tiny little bit
A	I guess you could
B	that's cheating
C	and it's a different photo
D	well I suppose you could but that would be rather cheating wouldn't it
B	that's not fair
D	it would but do people must do that though
A	different colouring
D	I think they must do that yeah
C	mm
D	well yeah
C	it's so easy to
D	that's right
B	it is a shame almost that
C	it loses the uniqueness doesn't it?
B	mm
D	yeah
A	mm
D	that's so easy to cheat
C	yeah
D	you can people where they weren't
C	yeah um you can change everything can't you
D	yeah
A	what you?
C	A couple of clicks with the button
D	yeah
B	mm
C	mm
B	right we should get going mum
A	okay
B	um that picture that what's the name of that flower? I've forgotten
A	bird of Paradise
B	bird of Paradise
D	in the other room
B	shall we get that?
D	we're not taking that though are we?
A	huh?
B	why? I think that would sell
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	you can't take everything though can you? We can take it along another time
A	yeah okay we've got quite a lot to carry haven't we
D	you've got a lot of stuff to take
B	okay
A	if they're interested they can go on the website you see that's what I thought
B	yeah
A	mm
D	that took me ages getting that one together
B	ow
D	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
B	you know things like that
D	yeah
B	so you've gotta make a run
C	mm
B	Cos it is like a trend isn't it?
D	yes it is yeah
B	and that one as well
D	yeah
B	make sure that they're all on the website
A	you know what that is don't you
B	yeah
A	oh
D	yeah
B	behind the flower?
A	yeah
D	behind the flower yeah
B	yeah but that's what they're doing er even down the road
D	probably
B	they
C	mm
A	I see right
B	I don't know
A	oh really?
D	yeah
C	mm
B	and like the first I saw was yours
A	did you? It brings it out a bit
B	yeah
C	and I think that if you've got these on like all your flower ones
D	yeah all yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	because if it's in a set it makes it more appealing
D	yeah
B	yeah and then people go oh which one? Which one do you like best?
D	you should have like flowers
C	well rather than going
A	yeah group them yeah
D	group
C	yeah rather than going from that to say that one to say a picture of a swan
D	yeah
B	I think they are fairly
C	and it's all different kind of genres
A	yes they are
C	but if you take put all that together
A	they are a bit of a mixture aren't they
D	they are a mixture yeah
C	it creates a look and it creates an image for you as well
D	yeah
A	mm
B	especially the flowers
C	mm
B	I think you should focus on them
C	mm
A	we can easily group the swans and that together can't we now
B	they're beautiful
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	but are they different pictures from both of you? Like
A	what the swans?
B	you've taken some like swans and flowers and you've taken some swans and some flowers?
A	yeah
D	yeah well we we we're normally in the same place every time
A	Cos that's dad's and that's dad's and that one er over there is mine
B	I think you should put them all together
D	yep
B	I think you should put them all together
C	mm
A	what? Oh I see in our
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
D	mm yeah
B	yeah you could have your separate folder for the things couldn't you?
D	yeah
B	and then you could have a swans link yeah or a flowers link
C	mm you could have  you could have  swans woodland flowers
A	oh down the side?
B	yeah and put
D	well yeah that's that's what most of the photographers do on these sites
A	so everyone's would be together like landscapes yeah
B	yeah
A	landscapes animals birds
C	mm
D	yeah
B	that's a good
D	that's what most of the photographers do
A	yes I guess they do
D	yeah
B	so you can look at them in two different er ways
A	yeah but all all the all of them will go in
C	you can go to what you're interested in straight away
D	you can yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mountains
A	or even er other countries or something like that
