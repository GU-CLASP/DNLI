E	very funny
E	oh god

B	they like it basically
E	yes
B	yeah
C	lol
E	yes
B	like a
B	oh my god
C	where's your
B	yeah cos like I mean it's like you know how it is at the moment it's like I'm a bit like I'm not on thin ice with them but I'm trying like to prove to them that I'm not a fucking idiot right and like I just forwarded that email cos we was leaving the house
B	lol this colour
B	and then it was like all of our conversations like retarded you know it's like
B	it's like we were just talking in like fucking like numericals and like text speak
B	you know it was like fucking
B	I'm like oh man I really need them to not know I'm a dick
B	I felt like fucking
E	can you?
B	you can change the
C	busted
E	I do that all the time
C	there was
E	like I delete like I forward people emails at work and then delete the thread of like what I've been talking to the other person like but then if that person replies it brings up the thread again
B	yeah
E	it's like fuck
B	yeah
E	I can't be fucked man
C	at the end of
B	normally it doesn't on mine I'm not normally like
E	my work
E	they're so prissy about like
B	and like I try not to be an idiot
E	the way you converse on the email
C	really?
E	yeah
E	like everything has to be spelt right
C	oh what?
E	I know fucking hate it
C	spelling?
E	the spelling has to be right
C	that's bullshit because
A	they like er er
E	dude I'm fucking terrible at it
B	and he calls the er soup urns like soup urns like E A R N S
E	dude I'm dyslexic as fuck
C	loads of people are dyslexic
E	like it takes me so long to write an email at work like I have to like write it out in Microsoft Word
C	yeah
E	spell check and then copy and paste it
B	oh man that's fucked
C	but it's really weird cos like I feel like ever since I I entered the world the world of the world of work I have encountered lots and lots of people especially in cooking who are who are dyslexic like from
B	mm
B	probably wouldn't be allowed in
C	it's so crazy yeah it's really really crazy
B	I really think it's strange to be hung up on spelling
C	yeah because I'm just like well of course I understand what I means and also
B	yeah
C	and also I realise that I have like a massive erm or at least I did have have a certain amount of er prejudice towards people who were like not that good with words
A	he's like Einstein then
C	it's really weird like he's super bright but like there's something about him where he's just like on on first meeting you just like you like you don't think
E	it is weird as well like
C	certain things
E	how people like attack people that like
A	they do their asterisks
E	didn't spell it properly
A	or they
C	yeah
A	they do
E	it's like you know
A	you know the classic
E	still making like a really valid point
C	yeah yeah
A	and the the classic thing is the asterisk and like you're with the apostrophe
C	yeah
A	you know
C	but I think
E	but I don't know any of that shit I'm so bad at that shit
C	but I think a huge part of it is I mean
E	yeah totally a class thing
C	like on that like like I I like it's yeah and like grammar is specifically like you know I went to a grammar school weirdly
B	mm
C	all of my friends who were
A	grammar schools is a name though
C	pardon?
A	just like a name
C	grammar school?
A	yeah
C	no no I know I know but I but ironically like it doesn't really
A	yeah yeah
C	it it's not
B	yeah
C	whereas
E	yeah totally
C	whereas for me
E	no I had to do like interviews for people to get into university the other day
C	uhu
E	and it was shocking cos we it was the day that we had to interview people from er they have a relationship with colleges in like underprivileged areas
B	mm
E	and they have to let a percentage of
C	access
E	the students in yeah like access shit
C	yeah
E	but like looking at their work it was fucking amazing
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
E	and then there's these other kids that came in and
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	this is how you converse and like building that self confidence
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
E	they'd stand in front of us and like but and like yeah of course you're going to
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	and it's like
C	uhu
E	and she's just got this confidence
C	mm
E	about her
C	yeah
E	that like she can just come across she's got this confidence
C	yeah
E	and self belief
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	that like people from other areas of
C	yeah
E	don't have
C	that's where you're getting like
E	and she's cos she's like
C	that's what you get in a public school that sort of
E	yeah
C	stuff that that's the main aspect
A	and the entitlement until they
C	that's
A	get to like
C	yeah
E	yeah
C	that's and the
E	no it totally is
C	but the
E	it's like
C	and they're two and the same thing like they're two and the same thing you know
E	but it's the entitlement and like that being like yeah you can do shit and it's gonna happen
C	yeah it's like you're yeah and these these
B	yeah
C	are the ways in which you do it
E	and
B	yeah
C	woah
C	that's crazy
E	it's nuts
A	I didn't get into a grammar school
B	mm
C	really?
E	how's that? dumb
B	dumb fuck
E	dumb fuck I'm
A	then I reapplied to the same school for sixth form and then I got in
C	yeah fair enough man
A	it's not actually it's not even just it's it's not it's like this cos when I think of the school I went to it was a really good because they actually
C	yeah
A	to do like
B	yeah
A	they instilled with sort of like had big ambitions and were confident enough to go after them
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	they weren't just like told they were stupid the whole time they were just sort of like
C	yeah
A	sort of pushed to the things they were good at
C	yeah
E	no I like
B	mm mm
E	you know like you're put if you're like kind of good at science people are like you've got to be a scientist
C	yeah
E	but like creative there's like
C	which is bullshit
E	such a value placed on it and all these kids would turn up I was like who the fuck sort of like
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	cos you obviously have no talent in this and like it's not for me to say and like yeah they could probably go to university and meet these people and like have some fucking epiphany and
C	mm
E	just being in that like environment like come up with something
C	yeah
E	but like
A	so that I did it professionally
E	it's
A	do you know when you're seventeen you're obviously not going to
E	yeah it's just I dunno and it's just
C	yeah
E	I I just think there's like
C	but also like they
E	misplaced like
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	importance placed on it
C	I agree it think there's too much emphasis on like so what are you interested in? and it's like well
E	yeah I think it's really irresponsible
C	and and but but like but like all of those aspects would potentially be good in in a in a billion different other careers alongside like some other
E	yeah exactly
C	it's so stupid
E	or to an industry that we actually have and people can make as much money as they
C	yeah yeah exactly
C	exactly yeah
E	you know like we don't have a fucking
A	but I always think they
C	yeah
A	so it shouldn't just be like
C	yeah yeah there's this whole and like
E	but I don't I
A	and teach you how to be a functioning person
C	yeah yeah yeah exactly it's like
E	but the issue I think is is like
C	there's this all there's all this emphasis on on on on on on on this this like sole career being your identity and that's what you are whereas actually especially as a woman I I I know I know it's different for men as well but but but historically as a woman you are a mother like maybe or not but you're also like a huge part of your identity
A	yeah
C	people don't just do one thing that's fucking
E	yeah
C	bullshit like no one like very few people do just one thing or they do one thing for a bit and then they do another thing for a bit
E	no
C	is it?
E	no it was I felt really like disgusted by the whole process
C	I bet yeah it's
E	and it was but also it was like what was really like
C	mm
E	to be like that's not gonna like validate this thing you have here and
A	also but some people are aware of like the whole thing and know that they're just they do this and put this act on
C	yeah it's just
A	to do for the
C	a hoops thing
A	for the
C	yeah people definitely get that
E	yeah
C	especially people who then go on to be successful like the like the middle classes understand that you have to jump through hoops you have to jump through hoops your whole like your whole career until you graduate
B	especially if you
C	yeah
E	but I also think
C	and after
B	huh?
A	let me take it
B	tea?
C	but so so so I think at that level of you're a rude boy and you recognise that you have to jump through hoops that's just the same as like
E	mm
C	actually gonna turn out to be like a fucking corporate director or like
E	yeah
C	more like a manager of Sainsbury's or something
E	yeah but I don't I dunno oh
C	yeah
C	but I also think that like
B	always
C	there's something really horrible and weird and shit about
B	mm
C	you know along the way everything will be kind of cool or maybe it won't be cool I have no idea
C	but you know like doing shit is awesome
B	yeah
C	and and I feel like at so many levels especially if they're disadvantaged there are so many situations where you could just be like wow fuck it
E	yeah but also a massive thing
C	I'll just go I'll just go on the dole and watch the Youtube videos
C	cos you could be happy doing that
E	great
B	mm
E	like when I
E	when I was like
E	but when I like
E	because of the class background I came from it was like
C	right yeah yeah
E	the life that we lived in so it was like you know it was like if you were like kind of interested in film everyone was like go and be a director or if you're like you're kind of interested in clothes people were like go and be a fashion designer like there was
B	yeah
E	no awareness that there's like actually an industry and there's like a whole like base of different like careers you could have in that
B	yeah
E	it's like go and be a filmmaker not like okay you could work in production or you could work in like PR or you could
C	yeah
E	work in de de or you could be a lighting guy you could be a cameraman or you could be a director it was like
C	mm
E	so people were just like aimlessly and like
B	mm
E	so we're just gonna push you like wholeheartedly into it
C	yeah
E	and just like hope like on a wing and a prayer that you'll make it and kind of that sort of thing
A	but I just think but I think it's er it's not that difficult to sort of
E	dude I'm only just working that out now and I'm twenty-nine
A	but that's when you're like working you could I wanna be a director and you do some work experience that your school fixes up for you
E	yeah in
A	and then you're sort of like
E	not when but not when you come to
C	yeah
E	cos it doesn't exist
B	yeah
E	like you know that because you grew up and you grew up in like you you know you had friends and family
C	I agree
E	and blah blah blah that like work in those industries like
A	yeah
E	like fucking
A	yeah yeah
E	you don't like have a conversation about Francis Bacon when I was like sixteen
B	yeah
E	like you
B	I was the same mm
E	you know? it's like I'm only but then I meet other people and they've known that shit since they were like
B	it's like how the fuck do you do the world?
E	fourteen
E	but also I feel
C	yeah
E	like a massive thing it's like
C	yeah
E	and through like marketing
C	yeah no I know but yeah
E	so but we have to build a creative economy to validate people investing money in our
C	yeah of course
E	country so it's like
C	yeah
E	cos it validates our like financial capital
C	yeah
E	but there's actually pretty much no industry there
C	yeah
E	apart from a service industry to the financial industry
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	so we have to build creative capital but without there necessarily being
C	yeah it is confusing
E	work
C	cos like when you when you talk about like having having people who who who who sort of have done those things before and you look look towards like all that
E	yeah
C	you know all those kind of like
E	no I was sort of saying this to my friend the other day
C	and it's like
E	it was like that like you look at everyone and like you knew what they did as a
C	yeah
E	he's a greengrocer he's a lawyer
C	mm yeah
E	he's a doctor he's not like oh he's the guy that does this thing in that
C	yeah
E	world
C	yeah
E	it's like
C	although
E	yeah
C	and he was like you know cos cos because there's this idea that everybody has their you know what they wanna do but I was you know I did this and then I did that and I know these people who did this and then they did that and then they changed their idea and I'm eighty-two and I still don't know what I wanna be
E	I wanted to be a shelf stacker for years
E	I really did I wanted to do it
E	I thought the way you got
C	that is amazing
E	and I used to do it I used to go to shops and just stack
E	like arrange stuff on shelves
E	and I really believed that I'd get seen on CCTV
A	and scouted
E	camera and someone would scout me
E	and it would be like you're really good at that
E	it's so depressing I wasn't like I wanna be an astronaut like I wanna work in a shop
C	I wanted to be a cat when I grew up
