B	how long will it take to walk?
A	oh
B	oh there you go
A	you have to fly
B	but you do so you are going
A	oh
B	the wrong way at first
A	I get oh I see what you mean
B	cos look you are you're definitely going backwards
A	backwards we're going backwards
A	okay I get it
B	ah right okay where are you going sorry?
A	so we're going to
B	and is this
A	we we're in
B	yeah
A	yeah I was in
B	but is that where you were working? is that where you first went?
A	that's where I lived for the whole time
B	okay
A	actually erm I visited other places but I only ever lived in
A	it is actually erm well that's actually pretty slum area
B	cos that's nice oh
A	so it is nice and this is a big tourist spot erm I wonder if there's any other pictures of it
B	I like the architecture I like the the colours the coloured houses and stuff
A	yeah the colours
A	the the colours are the nicest thing about it actually
B	mm
A	so there's two they're called
B	mm
A	and then there's another one just behind it but you really can't go on to the other one or you couldn't when I was there
B	oh really?
A	cos it was really dangerous so nowadays I'm just seeing if I can find a picture of the steps
B	that's nice
A	yeah again look so this is the hill on the other side
B	mm
A	not touristy
B	yeah
A	you can't
B	mm
A	actually
B	mm
A	it so you go up these this is the
B	oh
A	so
B	mm
A	and if you're meeting somebody you don't say I'll meet you in such and such bar you'll say I'll I'm in a bar it's on step number two hundred and forty-five
B	oh that's cool
A	so yeah it's one of the it's sort of one of the nicer areas
B	mm
A	pictures of the steps so this is the erm
B	mm
A	so you can kind of
B	well that would have been quite a walk then
A	walk in here er yeah it is relatively
B	mm
A	again there's a lot more high-rise buildings there when when I was there actually and this is actually near where we got married
B	mm
B	you weren't on a boat were you?
A	a bit this way yeah not on that boat
B	mm
A	that boat was a bit dull
A	this one's just a bit boring and a bit historical so we didn't go on that one but that was where we got married
B	well where where's your boat moored?
A	ha?
B	was it moored?
A	it was but then it was for most of the evening but it did go around the
B	and
A	round the river
B	where's the oh is that the steps?
A	yeah those are the steps finally yeah those are the steps
B	ah okay
A	so it's quite hard work to get up them
B	mm
A	but the
B	mm
A	they're not all the big posh houses
B	mm
A	that you get in
B	and
A	yeah it's
B	mm
A	it you well you don't go a block back
B	mm
A	if you're a tourist
B	and where's the beach then?
A	so let's have a look at the map again the beach
B	mm the one with the plaits in her hair
A	eco warrior these days?
B	yeah probably yeah yeah I think she's
A	yeah so she's been there
B	oh
A	erm it used to be really really rough and I used to go with friends who just wanted we just wanted to go the beach and it was really wasn't very nice wasn't a very nice beach wasn't a very nice town I think it's all been massively redeveloped and is quite posh these days erm so but anyway we're not going to
A	that's quite posh
A	there's a
B	mm
A	one of the provinces has go the just weirdest names for weird er weird places
B	okay that sounds nice
A	er yeah it's the party town
B	go on put it on to what's it called
A	on to Terrain?
B	yeah
A	okay is it that one?
B	I think so
A	no
B	no
A	oh look there are some pictures though
B	yeah
A	er Earth? that one?
B	yeah
A	there we go
B	I like doing
A	wow
B	you could also put the little person on the road
B	it might not do at the moment
A	I don't think
B	it might be a bit far away
A	I
B	doesn't like it
A	in
B	oh
A	but they haven't got that yet
B	they haven't driven around with the van?
A	no
B	oh
A	someone would probably nick it
B	that's probably why
A	so it's not very clear is it?
B	okay no it's not no that's probably cos of that though like you say cos they combine it I think with
A	okay I'm just gonna go and
