A	but East Africa? was that all one country? or has?
B	no no it was three countries independent countries with their own president
A	so Kenya
B	Uganda
A	Uganda and
B	and Tanganyika
B	yes and Zanzibar of course was independent and separate
A	and Zanzibar is Zanzibar still a country?
B	no it was taken
A	oh like Zanzibar and
B	mm yes
A	oh really?
B	yes in a big revolution that they had
A	I didn't know that
A	is that what made it unstable or?
B	eh no for a little while
A	mm mm
B	because they sent
A	oh from the from the communist?
B	yes it was a communist revolution yes
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	I didn't know that
B	and then er
B	all the other stuff
C	okay so I'll offer the baked beans to pa
B	yeah yes I'm going to have ryvita and taramasalata
C	you can have what you like erm
A	mm mm well I'll I'll go in a minute
C	oh you you've done that did you have a tea cup?
A	you've just picked it up
C	oh sorry I must have taken mine
A	I've never been
B	well I'd be
A	yeah
B	and I had a big sort of plant collection press them and I'd take them into the
A	mm so it changed it used to be safe
B	it changed and changed yes and when there was at the other side of one of the game parks was a hill that we called
A	oh wow
B	and and there was sort of semi circular tracks up it and you could climb right to the top and one way you looked to Kilimanjaro it was lovely
A	oh wow
B	and the other way you looked right across Kenya to mount
A	on your own?
B	ah no not on my own
A	little
B	both there
B	and then er the last time I went was when I was sixty-five
A	mm mm
B	so we went out of the game entrance and then we went and we said we were going to climb this and they said oh you must take a guard with you
A	really?
B	and they gave us with a an African who didn't really want to come with an A K fourteen slung over his arm you know? to guard us
A	cos it was that dangerous?
B	and er well they said that it was that dangerous because er
A	I guess it's also like if something happened it would be on the news and they don't want any bad press
B	yeah no they didn't want that cos they were trying to build up the tourist trade as well
A	and I guess now that's been totally
B	and it it was fairly dangerous cos it was one part where Somalia came almost down right down like that
A	oh that's always been dangerous Somalia
B	and you could look eh where they've always been raiders and thieves really
A	well
B	and they were of course poaching the animals in the game parks it was done largely by the Somalis and so we had to have this chap and so he said you're not going to climb up to the top are you? you know?
A	ah
B	up after us he didn't want to come at all but he managed to get there and er we gave him a drink of water and
A	sounds alright
B	and we sat and admired the view for a bit and then we went down again
A	ah
B	but I thought that it spoilt it though cos before it was just you and Africa and nobody else but to have a chap with a rifle you know?
A	it's not quite the same
B	slung over his shoulder no no
A	I'm not sure where I would go in Africa South Africa I guess is safe
B	mm towns aren't safe they're very unsafe
A	really?
B	mm
A	it's just so sad there's a whole continent that
B	yes I know it's all
A	yeah I've I can't even imagine what Africa's like you know?
B	mm mm
A	I've been to Morocco
B	mm mm it's not like that that I should think at all
A	but
E	well I've been to Egypt and it's not like that
B	no no no no
E	no
B	oh it it it is lovely and
E	mm
A	what? cos
B	because they're being poached and poached and poached and you drive along and there's dead rhino lying there you know? hacked to bits and
E	uhu
B	it's just not the same and and the
A	they're just not free
B	the game they don't realise what they're losing once the game plains of East Africa are gone the tourists won't want to go there anymore
A	yeah
E	mm
B	and all they can see them are is money money money you know? and it's the it's the Chinese and the Japanese that will buy them
E	ah
A	what? the rhinos and?
B	the rhino horn cos they think it's an aphrodisiac so they used it as medicine
E	that's horrible though isn't it?
B	and er the elephant tusks for ivory
A	but what do they make out of ivory these days?
B	well they carve it and er sell it
C	figurines yeah
B	mm
C	erm there's cheese and erm bread and rice cakes and ryvita and salad
E	oh
C	but would you rather have baked beans on toast?
E	no I like I'd rather have what you suggest cheese and
C	okay okay
E	salad and
C	that's fine okay okay
E	mm
C	well there's hummus and taramasalata
E	oh
A	is it very mountainous around there? or is it just like a very
B	erm the well there's a string of sort of volcanic hills which are quite quite big
A	yeah
B	and then there's plains
E	mm
A	is it?
B	yes quite that's why it's cold it's not it's not a hot city
A	is it not?
B	no it's called the city in the sun and you get a lot of sunshine but it's blooming cold you know?
A	oh
A	oh have you? you've never been to Africa Africa grandad?
B	well it is a dangerous place now because
E	if you
B	for
A	wow
B	in the last twenty years
E	if you were to ask me which is the nicest place I've ever been to on holiday which is a bit different my answer would be a complete contrast to what you're talking about
A	Norway
B	yeah mm
E	mm
A	yeah that's my I had a brilliant holiday there
E	yeah
B	yes
E	mm
B	I'd like to see it but I wouldn't want to live there in that
A	no it's amazing
E	yeah well I went in the summer of course but
B	mm mm mm
E	had a holiday with er
B	mm
A	I loved Norway we we took the same
E	yeah
A	and I took the same train it was
B	mm mm
E	mm mm
A	it's really like you go through the mountains up onto the glacier
B	mm mm
E	yeah
A	like I don't think you go through fjords but you go past lakes which look like fjords
E	yeah
B	oh
E	caused much
B	oh well I see
E	yeah but
B	mm
A	no it'd be alright now
E	yeah well we'd had it booked quite a long time before mm
B	mm
E	mm mm
A	have you ever been to Norway?
E	sorry?
A	no
B	no yeah
E	yeah mm
B	no never I've been to very few places in Europe
E	mm
B	because we left after
E	mm mm
A	ah I love Europe I don't know anything else really
B	no no nice to know it and that
E	mm
B	I like I like the interest of it the history and the the old churches and the and that
E	mm
A	mm
B	but otherwise I
C	do you like that card?
A	ah it's cute
C	and that one?
A	yeah
C	I got this one for dad
A	that's good they look like people
E	what are they? cards for
C	mm
B	oh
A	don't they? those trees look like people?
B	yes yes isn't that nice? yes yes they do with ginger hair
A	yeah like all a bit angry
C	mm no
E	mm
C	I just brushed it for once first time today I had time to brush my hair
B	yeah
A	I need to give
E	mm
B	mm
C	ah
A	mm
B	mm
A	what time do you have to leave tomorrow? not that I want to talk about it
C	why don't you give it to him his present tonight?
B	okay
C	that'll be nice
B	because cos I thought then he'll say oh let's open it and it's a special one for him
E	mm
C	oh no well well if he does
A	what time are you leaving tomorrow?
B	not sure it'll be early morning not not
A	mm
B	the plane leaves at eleven thirty
A	mm
C	oh you will be leaving frantically early
E	mm
B	so it's two hours
C	cos you're supposed to be there erm three hours beforehand so you're supposed to be there at eight thirty
A	well two hours
B	it says two hours yes
C	oh does it?
B	yeah on on my
C	are you sure?
B	it says you may check in er yes it's two hours I think for
E	mm
C	I'm very surprised if it's
E	mm
E	I'm sure
C	well
B	no I wouldn't cos I haven't really looked at the ticket
E	oh
A	two hours is fine
B	you know why should I?
E	mm mm
C	I think you'll be leaving early anyway because in case there's any problem on the M25
E	mm
B	see here it says dear sir or madam thank you for your email we have updated your seat request but although we will do our utmost to ensure your seat request is met we are unable to guarantee confirmation
C	but that's appalling
B	isn't that awful? because it was ages ago that I booked
C	yeah cos you were booked in ages ago for assistance on an aisle seat
B	yeah aisle seat yes
C	that's that's really not on that
B	we would like to advise you about the check in facility
A	I think they just they say that just in case like there's some reason why they can't it's like a get out clause
C	mm but actually
E	oh yeah
C	ah well maybe if you've got erm assistance maybe it is two hours actually
C	yeah
E	mm
C	yeah
B	no no no this doesn't no
A	yeah two hours will be fine
B	provided you're not you wouldn't get there absolutely
C	you might get a seat you'd get one of those ones that the air hostesses erm have to sit in
E	mm
B	well I should tell them I'd rather stand
A	oh it's horrible when you're in the middle isn't it?
B	mm yeah because
C	I you just need to burst into tears
B	mm
C	I think that would probably be quite powerful
E	mm
C	that's what I'd do
B	mm mm yes well I I know how to say and but I I just can't get in a a
C	no well no
B	if it's a night flight you get almost straight into the night and
C	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	and and if you I want to go to the loo you have to step over somebody else's you know? legs I couldn't do that
A	yeah
E	mm mm
B	it was terrible fortunately I had a very nice chap next to me a Malaysian and he always said oh that's alright you know? I'll get up and he got up he had to completely
A	but I think you have to anyway like whenever I'm you have to ask people to move
B	mm but I've I needed to er stretch my legs
A	yeah
B	because otherwise they get
E	well so do I
B	my knees get very crooked up
E	yeah mm
B	you know? so I had to go a couple of times during the night which was
C	we'll be eating at seven o'clock
B	right
C	I mean it may be that because you're in the economy class there are fewer aisle seats actually
B	oh there are yes and it's only
C	but I mean they should have reserved the ones
B	but they should have reserved it cos I booked
C	for a disabled person yeah they should
B	mm I I booked
A	what do you mean there are fewer aisle seats?
B	well it's only
C	because
A	yeah but there's probably the ratio of aisles
C	oh the ratio will be well no it's not because there are fewer seats in a row so the ratio's different actually
B	mm yeah mm yeah so there's no the five seats in the middle
C	no
B	it's four seats in the middle
C	four and then is there a three at the sides it's probably two is it?
B	mm mm mm
A	so there's probably more aisle seats per number of seats?
C	yes
B	mm
C	but
B	yes
C	mm
B	but when I got off off the plane and I I said to the woman who had helped me you know? to a little van to get my luggage I said she said were you alright on the
C	yeah yeah yeah
E	oh mm
A	oh it makes sense
B	mm it does really really yes
C	yeah I thought
B	well they were last time but
C	they've obviously well they've obviously changed a bit and
E	mm
B	they were they were
A	oh the economy?
B	oh no the end of August
A	the economy plus?
B	yes it was worth it cos the seats were a decent size
A	yeah
B	but there was no
E	huh?
B	and we had to go through to economy and right well almost to the end
A	never end guess they haven't designed them for that
B	no they hadn't designed it properly yet
C	will they change the? change it according to erm how many
B	mm well apparently it's very popular
B	oh well er
E	ah
C	but she won't be coming up to
B	no no
E	no mm
C	no she'll
