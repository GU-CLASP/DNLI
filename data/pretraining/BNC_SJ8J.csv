A	then I've got to write the model no I've got to write the questions and then I've got to write the model answers for each one of those
B	yeah and you need to make sure there's three points
A	yeah
B	with each with the summary and
A	three points?
B	well it's three points for the summary isn't it? because then the marking guide you've got three
