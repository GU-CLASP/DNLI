A	well it was interesting anyway
B	well it's interesting being in an A and E department
A	yeah
B	yes
A	you've gotta know how much time and effort they spend giving people treatment
B	well the erm I don't think that weirdo was er
A	do you think so? Right
B	it wasn't didn't sound drunk
A	mm maybe yeah
B	yeah
A	A lot of security guys went after him
A	as opposed to a system which doesn't you can't afford it
B	yeah
A	I think that's it's like I said it's the same advice anyway
A	yeah yeah
B	ay
A	so I know
B	could do
A	but you know as in after two weeks you could go for another X-ray and you might just
B	well you don't wanna X-ray sort of
A	true
B	yeah
A	yeah? Fingers crossed it is shin splints cos then it'll only be a couple of weeks
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er but
A	yep
B	ah
A	yeah
B	erm but yeah the treatment's the same anyway
A	yeah
B	yeah next Monday
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it can give you some ideas for varying it
B	two weeks of swimming
A	hmm mm
B	I don't want to know what's going on in the back of that car
A	I didn't even see what that was
B	no it was trying to fit a lot of people into it
A	oh
B	A small space
A	ha ha
B	possibly a whiskey
A	whiskey? There's a bit of TV?
B	yeah maybe
A	bit of ice? Or not?
B	yeah I probably should actually
A	put a little bit of ice yeah
B	I could use a shower actually
A	yeah I should probably shower
B	well it's not going to be an early night
A	well it's not too bad
B	the thing that annoyed me a little bit is it wasn't exactly rammed in there
A	mm
B	I did get the impression that you know just resource allocation I don't I'm not sure it's entirely necessary for us to have had to wait for it
A	no
B	what was it? An hour and a half two hours?
A	X-ray yeah
A	yeah yeah I mean
B	which as it is agonisingly painful
A	yeah
B	but it is hurting now
A	yeah
B	no er
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	can we put some American Anthems on?
A	yeah sure
B	disc three
A	okay
B	bizarrely driving probably isn't doing it a horrendous amount of good
A	mm
B	well that'll be fine cos it's not a lot of clutch action
A	mm that's true yeah
B	I need an automatic
A	yes
B	dad can I borrow the V seventy?
A	oh nice
B	I actually need it to get to work
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah maybe er best not to but
B	I don't wanna
A	ha ha
B	erm
A	but maybe yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	okay well either way
A	I think we've got a full pack in
B	just get both
A	ha ha
B	they're very effective together
A	yeah
B	well cos you can take both at the same time
A	mm
B	it's a trick
A	ha ha
B	well no just making sure that say thank you and
A	oh yes
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I mean that was a fairly quiet Thursday night
B	yes
A	which is yeah
B	the guy opposite us?
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure what
A	yeah it was wasn't it
B	so any others?
A	um there was um one of the the guy who was with the guy who ran off seemed to have some kind of facial injury
B	right
A	um
B	that guy he really did have a swollen face didn't he
A	oh my goodness
B	oh although casts you don't necessarily just cast from a break you can cast for
A	mm
B	mm
A	do you know what I mean? Like just when they described it she didn't
B	yeah
A	no
B	I'm actually going to suggest would you like to go first?
A	mm
B	mm
A	huh
B	what?
A	so the couple opposite
B	oh yes
A	the guy with all the tattoos messing about with the
B	I've learnt a lot about world geography
A	yes
B	nah I keep I just keep taken time to keep my mind occupied and not bored
A	yeah
B	this is a really inappropriate song
B	sort of
A	the next one's more appropriate for the for tonight
B	what's that?
A	oh this is on it's on triple oh one one
B	mm
A	I think well my dad's main problem was he didn't used to sleep
A	it was on call rather than necessarily night shifts initially
B	well just sleep the next day
A	exactly yeah
B	well to be fair though that's his
A	he did
B	I think that's sort of the problem with him not a problem with the system
A	mm
B	is that?
A	but it didn't suit my dad at all basically
B	I wonder if we've got a slight wheel imbalance
A	oh
B	slightly
A	mm
A	hmm
B	actually that's pretty good because we had some break until after
A	you what sorry?
B	I don't fucking believe it
A	what the bank holiday? I know chuck
B	hmm?
A	hmm
B	oh I can swim anyway
A	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah? So throw yourself into your swimming and your weights
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	actually I could do some upper body isolation
A	mm
B	core's probably fine
A	depending on what it is but
B	well I could do one legged core
A	I was just about to say one legged plank is excellent
B	buttock exercises
A	oh definitely
B	some
B	could even do some tricep isolation
A	yeah
B	mm
A	which you don't normally particularly do
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	bit of body building
A	absolutely
B	oh I dunno
A	poor soul
B	I felt the doctor person was nice
A	she was very nice
B	no
A	you wanna go home so yeah
B	I'm not sure she realised I just wanted an X-ray
A	I think she probably didn't
B	I just didn't look at the results
A	oh
B	I thought she would have actually X-ray me
A	roll him over a few times
B	yeah
A	get his leg waving about for the cameras
B	you'd think you'd at least get a copy of the X-ray
A	yeah
B	damn it
A	but yeah
B	mm
A	but erm did you
B	over my what?
A	over you
B	no no
A	no?
B	it's only localised
A	oh right yeah
B	so they put a plate underneath my leg
A	yeah
B	and it was closer to that
A	my grandpa always goes in with my gran
B	mm
A	and er last time they were there
B	yeah
A	and they were chatting to the girl and it transpired that they er something
B	hang on this is the girl who
A	who erm no no no
B	it was someone else who
A	erm was it? It was yeah it happened a fair bit
A	that's nice
B	are you having trouble now?
A	ha
B	I do not believe that
A	ha
B	it's really bruising to the ego
A	yeah
B	it shouldn't be but it is
A	I could sense you being like oh put the foot down a little bit maybe
A	ha
B	popular apparently
A	X-rays?
B	no the ankle
A	oh the ankle
B	that's what I just had X-rayed
A	yes
B	impressive
A	it was very impressive
B	mm
A	ah
B	I'm just watching as she's waiting for a vehicle without her lights on
A	mm
B	which would be incredibly stupid
A	yes
B	but possible
A	yeah yeah
B	oh there's the smart car
A	oh is it?
B	yeah it is
A	oh dear
B	it's it's sub speed limit as well
A	interesting
B	well maybe
A	mm
B	I'm sorry I'm getting past him
A	ha ha
B	yes
A	ha
B	he sped up by miles away actually
A	yeah
B	possibly
A	ha ha
B	possibly
A	which seems you'd say cos then you can change your car
B	unless you're Tom Cruise
A	he does try very hard but he still can't disguise the fact he's teeny tiny
B	who was driving?
A	I couldn't see
B	I'd love it
A	I think in some ways it would be quite feel quite cosy
B	lovely and cosy
A	mm
B	imagine that
A	sounds like in some ways it's quite fun
B	A nice warm sleeping bag
A	exactly yeah
A	oh
B	what?
A	delivering stuff
B	oh that's why you thought of it because you saw the barge on the side of the road
A	oh right yeah yeah
B	wow
A	ha nice
A	oh
A	I wonder where that little smart car is going
B	mm
A	probably
B	I'd say that's probably fairly astute
A	ah
A	hang on wasn't it
B	yep
A	yeah it was wasn't it
B	Cos actually that was when we came to look round before we bought the house
A	yes it was wasn't it
B	yeah
A	and we wrote his name down
B	now friends on Facebook
A	yeah
B	sorry?
A	what a trajectory
B	that's very nice
A	look at that full tank of fuel
B	before the rats get in
A	yeah
B	I might possibly jump in the shower while you do that
A	that's okay
B	it's quite convenient having
A	what do you mean such a big hospital?
B	yeah
A	yes this is handy
B	yep so do I
A	ha probably yeah
B	what?
A	that's novel
B	who's twenty-four?
A	that's really strange
