A	I think you told me that before and I was like
B	uhu
A	oh yeah
B	I was like
A	she does look like her
B	I was like he'd be so happy
A	mm
A	mm
A	oh how low that is
B	mm my god
A	I've never done maxi
B	I would if I could pull it off
A	yeah
B	I feel like you need like a certain type of
A	mm
B	figure to do it else it just looks like a
A	why?
B	block of
A	uhu
B	I have a long skirt in
A	and did I tell you you know I was looking to move out?
B	uhu
A	but I think I've managed to negotiate a rolling contract so I'm gonna say
B	yeah I saw your Facebook post and I was like
A	yeah
B	oh
A	mm
B	this is new information
A	yeah so I'm got two people coming round on Monday to take a look
B	uhu
A	one's a
B	oh wow
A	and plays guitar
B	they sound interesting
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but
B	I've literally never met
B	oh but you know it's happening
A	oh yeah I can hear the
A	that's what I look for in a housemate
A	don't wanna waste it
B	I don't know whether I've legitimately ever had egg in a sandwich I think the concept scares me
A	like egg mayo by itself but with tomatoes?
B	mm
A	and it's like warm now
B	there's a taste in this that I can't identify which given that I made it I should be able to identify
A	uhu
B	I think it's onion but then sometimes I think it's ginger
A	mm
B	like both of those are in here but I don't know what this specific taste is
A	uhu
B	god our chat is so interesting
B	I have no idea how loud that is so I don't know what it's actually picking up
A	mm
B	I want erm
A	shall I bring it closer to us?
B	I once recorded an entire interview on my phone
A	uhu
B	erm cos I was writing for erm like a student newspaper erm and just interviewed erm my friend
A	mm
B	at the time
A	uhu
B	it was like really clear
A	oh yeah
B	croquet in fact when I went to
A	of course
B	oh god I know right I'm so glad I wasn't the only one that noticed this
A	he was like
B	yes I
A	he was
B	impression he was like
A	it was like
B	high off his face
A	yeah like just being completely
B	he like couldn't
A	egocentric and like flitting from thing to thing
B	yes
A	not taking anything in
B	yeah yeah yeah he like couldn't keep track of a thought it was so weird
A	yeah
B	when erm and like
A	was he like touching your leg did you say?
A	what brushed it? or was like
B	erm
B	it was more of a kind of just like like
B	but I was like hand
B	on my leg
B	cos at first I was just like oh yeah he seems really friendly la la la but he's
A	yeah
B	he Facebook messaged me as well
A	oh did he?
B	yeah so like I was mm er it did get to a point halfway through where I was kind of like is this that being nice to strange men thing I was
A	mm
B	warned about or is this okay?
A	did
B	I got the impression he did cos he picked up a phone call
A	yeah
B	during the set and he definitely said I love you on it
A	oh did he?
B	so like
A	uhu
B	I was just like mm maybe he's just
A	oh
B	high
A	like in one sense I kind of like that
B	yeah
A	doing random stuff but in the other sense I was like who are you?
B	yeah no I definitely like er felt quite like comfortable with him actually
A	mm
B	like apart from thinking he might be a psychopath I mean like
B	I kind of liked him cos he was really easy to chat to
A	mm uhu
B	but like
A	mm
B	he should not have been allowed to drive that home
A	yeah
B	cos even cos he'd blocked someone else in as well so even he'd have had to or someone would have had to have driven that to
A	yeah
B	but I mean given the Facebook message I assume he's alive
B	but yeah I got home and I was suddenly like shit I don't think he should have been
A	yeah what a strange guy
B	but yeah it was weird cos er like
A	mm
B	but then from everything he does he sounds like he must be older cos he sounds quite successful in his career
A	mm
B	but then he also sounds like he's just drunk and acts like he's just like high all the time
A	mm I guess
B	old career young brain
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos didn't he say he didn't go to uni? so I guess he's got like
B	oh did he not?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	he's got a life experience instead
B	yeah
A	but
B	I think he must be like rich though
A	mm oh yeah I bet that car was like his parents' or something
B	mm
A	he was like
B	yeah
A	the bloody four-wheel drive
B	he just didn't retain information though
B	what are you doing?
B	what a crazy guy
A	and then there was that guy with the really funny laugh
B	yes the first time he did that cos he was
B	he was so lovely as well
A	and there was one point I caught
B	mm
A	cos I think his friend clearly saw I was laughing at him
B	ah
A	and I didn't wanna be mean
B	he was lovely though
B	I actually think Wednesday was such a good day like genuinely I got home and I was really happy
A	mm uhu
B	oh washed my hair
A	mm
B	I've no idea how long it's been
A	congratulations
B	I know
B	mm
A	so did they bring their own croquet? I guess that's not press croquet
A	er oh
B	bit keen
A	maybe we can like rent it out from reception or something
B	what is this taste?
A	oh yeah
B	and then you eat the cheese and it has little imprint of
A	uhu
B	onion in it? it tastes like that
A	weird
B	but all the onion in here is cut
A	yeah
B	so
A	maybe like overnight the flavours soaked together and it produced something weird
B	maybe this is what happens when feta goes off
A	mm
B	uhu
B	I feel really sad I'm missing erm everything that's happening this weekend
A	mm I know
B	uhu
B	uhu
A	thing probably
B	yeah
A	but hopefully I'll be able to catch them for a couple of hours on Sunday
B	is
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I'm gonna take a break I think I've packed loads
B	the thing is it's mostly veg in there I actually used very very little quinoa
A	uhu
B	but erm
A	it's good cos it's kind of expensive isn't it?
B	yeah it's hard to get as well I literally
A	mm
B	couldn't find it the first few months I was here like I actually bought it with me from Scotland
B	like when I went to
B	uhu uhu
A	mm
B	let alone used
A	I'm into bulgar wheat I don't know
B	yeah I'm a big fan of bulgar wheat now
A	mm
B	erm but yeah yes quite like making
A	oh yeah I love my grains yeah
B	I don't actually know how you say them er it's definitely the I before the A
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I don't know how you pronounce it I'd better learn otherwise you know
B	I quite like them erm I used to use them just to thicken things before
A	uhu
B	but my like and my housemate
A	do they have a flavour?
B	mm
A	or just a texture?
B	I don't know if they do have a flavour basically my housemate who like works in nutrition but is one of most unhealthy people ever so it's really funny erm
B	yeah my
B	housemate
A	sounds fun
B	because you can soak chia seeds and have them as like a like a substitute kind of cereal porridgey yogurty
A	mm
B	thing? and no I've never done that but I know people who have and he did it and he mixed in matcha green tea powder?
A	oh
B	and he was like do you think I can sell this?
A	oh yeah people would love it
B	I think I may have put honey in it to soften it though
A	mm anything green
B	uhu
B	I really like green tea
A	I like green juices and green smoothies so you go hipster all the way
B	I think we've probably hit our ten minutes now is it definitely ten minutes?
A	it's been seventeen shall we go for twenty?
B	okay
A	I hope it didn't catch the bit about the
B	I just wanted to erm
A	mm
B	things I keep forgetting cos I don't think they do them over the summer I think it's term time
A	uhu yeah
B	but I
A	I forgot about that too
B	I need to do something
A	do it
B	I dunno how to do it but like
B	I just get really like bored not learning things
A	uhu I'm think I'm still like reeling
B	uhu
A	from the dissertation
B	yeah
A	I still don't want to learn anything
B	well yeah it's been a year for me so I think I'm like
A	mm
B	ready
A	oh yeah
B	a like little
A	uhu
B	that was really fun well not fun
A	mm
B	but good
A	I saw there was a
B	yeah
A	but I don't like
B	it's run by the same guy who did choir
B	yeah that was my fault yeah
B	I really don't know what this taste is I hope it doesn't kill me
B	yeah I mean
A	mm
B	of course it's been a few days but
A	uhu
B	it doesn't taste like the feta it literally tastes like onion flavouring or something it was so weird
B	cos it looked like it just had a sandwich in it and I was too lazy to wash it
B	I may have just emptied the crumbs out
A	want some
B	uhu
A	erm
B	okay we must be at twenty now right?
A	yeah shall we stop?
B	uhu
