B	in Tom Gates in the second book
A	yes
B	I found there was something really funny about Tom Gates' dentist
A	uhu
B	his name's doctor I mean Mr D Kay
A	don't get it
B	D Kay
C	decay? Mr decay?
B	er yeah decay
C	decay?
A	decay oh
B	Mr decay
C	what does
A	sorry? what does decay mean?
B	you know you can get tooth decay
A	you know that don't you? yeah don't don't start touching the chicken with your hands
C	I'm feeling if it's hot
A	yes but you could do that by putting a little bit on a fork and putting it near to your mouth rather than putting your hands all over it Mr Dr decay at least it's not Dr death or Dr torture
B	or Dr really
A	I had to ring the dentist to book at appointment with them
C	for you?
A	for me do you know what? I have been putting it off for ages cos I saw them I thought not that long ago and then they put a a new filling in and they said it will be fine and it isn't and I haven't been able to eat on that side of my mouth and I thought it was a few months ago but when I rang they said that it was March last year so it's a whole year ago
C	yeah
A	so you can put your fears to one side and they'll do a basic hearing test I hope and then probably they'll say to you that your hearing is fine cos that's what people said to me even though I can't really hear people
A	so
B	unless it's really bad they try and assure you that it's fine
A	well it I think there's there's obviously actual hearing problems and then there's just problems like probably you have what I have with there's lots of people in the room there's lots of background noise I can't really hear what people are saying
C	no it's not like that
A	is it not like that? what's it like?
C	erm sometimes when people are talking like this
A	mm?
C	I can't hear them
A	are you washing your ears properly? yeah? well anyway it'll be good to rule it out won't it?
C	mm
A	any issues so it was nice playing in the park after school wasn't it?
C	yeah
B	uhu
A	so
C	no he was ill
A	he was ill on his first day?
B	or at or at the dentist's
A	well well he weren't gonna be at the dentist's for a whole day
B	true but he may not be able to talk

C	I'll ask her when he gets home
A	can you just speak in a normal voice? we understand that you're being
C	she might say I don't know I think he's sick I may I'm gonna ask him when I get home but
C	well she doesn't really understand him
A	of course she does she's five she understands lots
B	isn't she in reception? oh yeah
A	yes
B	she might be four then
