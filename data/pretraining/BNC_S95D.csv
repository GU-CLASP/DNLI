A	so how much were your bargain buy shoes?
B	my bargain buy eh twenty-five eh great British pounds
B	em I don't know whether they'll be water resistant but you know what it doesn't matter
A	they've lovely
B	I went  I went  to em
A	very smart in black
B	I went to these em I went to loads of shops I just cos I'd been at work since like quarter to eight and then em my computer completely and utterly screwed up and eh and I just thought you know what I'm here I can't actually do anything and the team in Birmingham actually are struggling so let me  let me  go up there
B	and then I had a look around
A	totally
B	yeah
A	mm
A	go figure
B	so then I went to like you know cos they have the big department stores isn't there like Debenhams House of Fraser and stuff so I walked through all those and I thought if I can find a really nice solid pair of shoes like the brown ones I'd worn for the you know the ballet pumps that I wear
B	and then I thought if I can find something like that and then I did but they were like a hundred pounds and I thought you know what that's ridiculous
A	one hundred pounds
B	for little ballet pumps?
A	and did they look like they were going to last?
B	yeah
A	do you want some soup?
B	no
A	mm hm
B	I'm just gonna go and find the em the Tupperware thing and bring it down
A	no probs
B	yeah em I'm going back again tomorrow actually
A	so you came  you came  back from London tonight and you're going to London again tomorrow?
B	yeah
A	Good idea
B	Good idea
A	alright so what do you think of the top
B	wow that's lovely
A	it doesn't suit me at all because it suited me when I had a suntan but now I'm really pale
B	well you might get a suntan in the summer and it has a nice holiday top as well
A	yeah
B	but it's also a nice holiday top isn't it? To wear abroad
A	but
B	if you did get that colour back
A	if you
B	I like it
A	if you  like it if you'd wear it
B	exactly
A	cardigan but on me it just looks like it's a pyjama top or something
B	what about with em jeans with like light blue jeans?
A	yeah
B	the face
A	the colouring of the face or
B	I'd can I  can I
A	I'm happy for you to have it
B	try it on after?
A	yeah sure
B	but I think it's lovely
A	no
B	while you're washing up and then while you're eating
A	come on multitask woman
B	should we go in the lounge? It will be a bit it might be a bit warmer to eat
A	yeah wherever you want
B	I think it might be
A	bon app√©tit
B	abso-blinking-lutely
A	so what's in this? There is
B	yeah
A	then put potatoes carrots parsnips onion sweet potato and something else
B	wow
A	mm
B	I was going to say and then yeah then did you add them afterwards?
A	Will that be okay with the
B	oh put it  put it  alright down
A	and then blended it all up
B	yeah
A	and ta da
B	and then you added the chickpeas afterwards?
A	yeah I just put chickpeas in now because I needed some something heavy
B	yeah
A	do you want to try some?
B	yeah
A	like it?
B	mm
A	I guess it's the parsnip and the carrot
B	yeah
A	there's nothing else in it at all
B	God that is so gorgeous
A	mm
B	try a bit of this this is em this is just curried tuna almost
A	how did you do this?
B	with a god don't don't humour me
A	go on tell me
B	very very basic
A	it's not pathetic
B	I then everything is whacked in peppers tomatoes em masala salt black pepper eh sweetcorn tuna
A	mm
B	mixed and mixed together
A	no it's really nice
B	mm
A	fresh tomatoes or chopped?
B	four
A	mm
B	yeah I did
A	is that what keeps it a bit moist?
B	yeah absolutely
A	mm hm and is that wholemeal pasta?
B	mm hm
A	I don't think I've ever tried wholemeal pasta before
B	when you mix it up it doesn't taste bad at all
A	mm
B	it's like brown bread white bread isn't it?
A	I do like brown bread especially with seeds in it like that
B	mm
A	Warburton's stuff but sometimes white
B	mm
A	bread and loads of butter is the best
B	absolutely
A	I'll have to get me some of that
A	then again whenever I do pasta it's so unhealthy
B	why what do you do?
A	just because I about every
B	mm
A	with red pepper onions umm a can of tomatoes a bit of garlic
B	so
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	without the sweetcorn
B	this is curried up isn't it?
A	mm
B	mm
A	but the problem then is that I add so much Parmesan cheese
A	I think I only eat it
B	really?
A	so that I can put cheese on it
B	I find that if I eat it late and cos like when we have pasta Fezel always wants to put you know grated mozzarella or grated any cheese whatever cheese there is he wants to pop it on the top
A	mm
B	especially late at night
A	I know my Parmesan is never light
B	exactly
A	and just stick it all over and then when it melts and goes all stringy hmm
B	so what's going on with your work stuff now then? What's cos you took a break didn't you?
A	I'm waiting to hear for a few job applications and and then I'll take it from there
B	mm
A	but
B	and so everything you will do just until September and then you'll start it again?
B	mm
A	so I don't have to do that bit again
B	so you got a good big breathing space haven't you?
A	mm hm
B	do you think it would be okay to pick up from there then so you can just pick up and then
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that point
B	yeah
A	than it was complete exhaustion
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I'll be able to try I'll try and do some before
B	yeah
A	I'll try and do a lot of it the academic work before
B	yeah
A	January so at least I have the
B	A bit of a head start
A	mm
B	do you miss Spain or are you getting used to it a bit now?
A	em I miss
B	there's no spring here
A	I know
B	yeah
A	my body tells me that now this is the time where you start wearing sandals
B	relaxing a bit
A	no?
B	it is
A	yeah but the words British and summer time never go well in a sentence together do they? Have you got any holidays planned?
B	no
A	have you got any holiday time still to take?
B	yeah
A	mm no I didn't know that
B	they do
A	mm
B	and they worked for a
A	mm
B	and em so we always had like up to the age of twenty-four we'd have a really good staff discount
A	brilliant
B	and eh I mean the the flip side of it was the fact that you were always on a standby list
A	mm
B	but the good side of it was that as the years accrued and experience em pardon me and seniority like you know you get up the list a bit
A	oh no
B	coming back doing the same thing again doing the same thing again I remember doing the same thing in Toronto for a week I mean the the the Delhi one was the worst
A	mm
B	Cos obviously there's a difference isn't there? And em he then had to fly that weekend because obviously school was starting again there I was think I was going to like my fifth fifth form or something
A	yeah
B	em and the same thing happened in Canada I remember and it's so soul destroying going there everyday and then like to run into happy passengers
A	aw
B	boarding and you're standing on the side cos you have to go and check in first as well
A	and you just wanna go home
B	yeah
A	oh no
B	with em family and friends and whoever anyone
A	yeah
B	and I didn't know when I'd be sort of flying
A	how
B	so I was just like em hi yes I'm
A	do it
B	yeah
A	that happened to me in Sri Lanka once
B	mm
A	and we were getting on the plane to come back to Heathrow from Sri Lanka
B	mm
A	and they were all they were all these loads of
B	yeah
A	and everyone was like that's a bit strange what's going on here?
B	mm
A	and then as soon as we had all sat down they were like sorry there's been a delay everybody off and they put us in this tiny waiting room and the men the orange men we could see them they were still crawling all over the plane
B	yeah
A	but they said okay alright we we'll book a hotel for everybody
B	yeah
A	but had we not said anything
B	they would've  they would've  have been fine
A	yeah
B	Cos that was the other daunting prospect
A	definitely
B	alive
A	so what was em what were you going to say that you were thinking of going to India but could you fly?
B	yeah
A	with these special priced seats then?
B	yes so basically my mum and dad get like a couple of free tickets a year
A	mm
B	it's just absolutely great you know flying with  flying with  them now is not have we got a seat it's are we in club?
B	it's the
A	mm so
B	no
A	mm
B	all that kind of stuff
A	mm hm
B	so you just pass them on so you know British Airways you know pass their passengers over to Qantas and say you know I'm sorry would you mind flying with we'll upgrade you to first class or business class or something and
A	mm
B	you know circumvent it that way
A	mm
B	there were like they were the standard carriers now there's
A	yeah
B	you know air travel is cheap and all of that and so the everything's slightly different
A	mm
B	so he over the years accrued you know priority and we got pushed up the chain so actually you know retired people almost I think out of due obligation and certainly this was honoured in the past would you know experienced retired people would obviously be the first sort of you know you travel like normal passengers they wouldn't even really need to go into a standby list
A	no
B	and that's the same with us really
A	brilliant
B	well they had a you know the year that my dad was made retired which was two and a half years ago that's when they introduced look
A	what? For three months? It's crazy
B	I mean this was a a proposal
A	mm
B	I think  I think  it was rejected by the unions
A	not surprised
B	it was almost a case of if you want your job if you want to keep your job you have to work you know for nothing or absolute minimum you know for a little while until we get over this
A	aw
B	still getting over it
A	what so he had to retire a year earlier?
B	mm
A	did that affect his pension?
B	I'm not sure
A	but eh why did it affect him? Just because he wasn't ready to stop working?
B	yeah emotionally it affected him completely and utterly because suddenly you know you have to mentally prepare for such a transition in your life
A	yeah
B	and to like have spent your whole life doing something and then all of a sudden told you've got three months
A	yeah
B	and then what the hell do you do with the rest of your life
A	mm
B	we hope
A	so what happened at Carluccios?
B	so we sat there on this little table
A	were you eavesdropping?
B	so they were they sat as close as you were I suppose
A	oh okay
B	but on a a longer table
A	and what?
B	and he was like and then she was like oh thank you I want to
A	what kind of guru was he?
B	God knows little he was too busy talking about what money he was making rather than what he was bloody preaching
B	the poor little granny god knows how she got to terminal five
A	aw
A	it wouldn't surprise me if he was some kind of yoga guru
A	the one the Ashtanga one
B	well it is a money
A	making a profit
B	you know
A	mm
B	if you can't spin the money you know if you need to you can't get to be Madonna's yoga teacher
A	it's not something personally I'd aspire to
B	no
B	no
A	yes making lots of money but
B	no but that's it isn't it? That's where you know
A	oh the famous girl?
B	yeah
A	is she art is she an actress?
B	she she dominated Bollywood in the nineties
A	oh yeah yeah yeah you said
B	she was absolutely massive in the nineties
A	and now she's reclusive
B	yeah
A	mm
B	pretty features you know like really good clean wholesome lovely girl
A	yeah
B	kind of thing and em
A	so is she going to make a comeback to films now?
B	she made it about three years ago and then she denied it was a comeback
A	uh-huh
B	so they had to take their earpieces out there was interference or something and so she kept holding the card like you know behind the actress to say take you know take you earpiece out something
B	and then in the end Madhuri turned around and she said I think that white piece of paper there's an instruction should we just stop and see what what it's says
A	oh she hadn't realised it was?
B	so then the girl ran on the stage and she's said I'm really really sorry can you just take your earpiece out  can you just take your earpiece out? So they took their earpieces out and then the girl said to her who'd run on the stage oh if you want you know can you take your earring off please? Right
A	darling
B	darling
A	can't be done I'm afraid
B	yeah
A	they're all dressed up beautifully but you can see that they've got this big they look like the hunch back in Notre Dame
B	yeah
A	because they've got the big
B	cable
A	big box underneath their dress
B	yeah
A	what is it? Is it for the mic? Yeah
B	it's kind of similar like a radio mic so the whole sort of em earpiece thing
A	ah
B	so you can't see it
A	ah
B	but you can get really discreet hearing aids that just that don't get over the ear that go right in there right?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	what he looks like
B	well I I was going to say I bet he doesn't really mind?
A	he doesn't
B	yeah
A	it doesn't look aesthetic
B	yeah
A	when he was having em the radiotherapy for the skin cancer on his face the he had to have radiotherapy for like
B	when was that?
A	eh last month
B	you didn't say anything
A	eh it's all preventative it's not
B	and zapped it up
A	yeah
B	when where was it though?
A	right here on the cheek bone
B	okay so away from the eye
A	yeah just like but right under it
B	yeah
A	what probably more than they thought that they needed to but just as a precaution they wanted to give him some treatments
B	has it all being cleared up?
A	em he'll have to wait and see but you know because it was
B	you didn't mention anything
A	aw well he was quite chilled about it
B	what does that mean?
A	it's a very it's one of the least aggressive forms of skin cancer
B	okay so very benign
A	yeah
B	we'll I've lost em my mum's sister
A	oh dear
B	em and eh my auntie has just em had cancer near her thyroid so you know
A	Dodgy
B	and that was a couple of weekends ago so I need to see her next weekend but that's
A	aw
B	you know and and she died from cancer and so it came back and em
A	oh dear
B	so I sort of
A	how how old was she?
B	we're both scared of it
A	really?
B	yeah
A	and what kind of cancer did she have?
B	breast cancer again
A	aw
B	whereas my auntie who died my mum's sister you know hers like properly spread all over you know and that was  that was  a really long drawn-out affair because it started I can't remember where it started in kidneys or the stomach or something but it spread to the back and you know
A	oh dear
B	spreading all over and they flew her everywhere
A	yeah it must have  it must have  cost a lot of energy concentration health money
B	A couple of years cos they thought it had cleared up or at least stabilised and then it kept going
A	aw
B	and the kid and the kids wouldn't accept no for an answer in particular her young son
A	no
B	the dad was so in love with his wife that he just he was quite reclusive he just like lost the will to have any sort of family relationship now
A	what a shame
B	I am with the youngest with my cousin and his sister they both sort of live em like they live quite close to my parents' house but I don't see them often maybe every sort of couple of years
A	yeah
B	and then em
A	that's the thing people either support each other and come closer together or
B	yeah
A	cope in different ways that kind of  kind of  grate against each other
B	and my  And my  uncle who was very much in love with auntie like very you know other other couples they you know they've been together for forty years so they get on with it
A	mm mm
B	they were really really in love and he was just completely and utterly in love and I think they have like a house in Goa and he
A	mm
B	he just doesn't want any he's just disengaged
A	oh well if he's happier like that it's his decision I guess
B	I am actually
B	and I thought about that when I was cooking oh bloody hell I haven't got a poem
A	do you know which one what you're gonna be reading? What? You've written a couple?
B	I haven't written anything
A	wait
B	I wanted to recite a poem I've written
A	eh huh
B	but I haven't had the chance to write it
A	how long is the train journey from Birmingham to London tomorrow? What are you going to write it about?
B	women you are great we should celebrate
A	oh there you go
B	international Women's Day
A	that's it
B	women we are great we should celebrate
A	but not you cos you're a man
B	but not you
A	but not if you can
B	oh talking about bloody man
A	oh yeah
B	but because they were in like such a conversation they were ooh I think that would suit you something something I was like thinking it was actually a really big lady
A	yeah oh no and that happened to me as well coming out of yoga class did I tell you?
B	no
A	the woman with her hand
B	you're going to scare me I know
A	and all I could see was this hand that looked like a mannequin's hand em but I I was you know just when you walk out of yoga you're a bit
B	yeah
A	your head's all over the place
A	so I thought okay maybe it's a a like a plastic hand but they're used to display jewellery on or something
B	I know what you mean
A	speechless
B	speech
B	why did she take it off?
A	because it was chafing underneath and had I listened to the conversation I probably would have understood the context of the situation but I was
B	yeah
A	completely spaced out
B	yeah
A	just came out of the yoga class and you know you're just like because you do the last ten minutes lying on the floor
B	yeah
A	with your eyes closed so I was half asleep
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	basically a
A	mm
B	with his class he's such a bloody you know and then  and then  you know you lie down oh yeah great and actually the most relaxed I've felt is after hot yoga because actually you really appreciate it you know
A	mm
B	and I
A	oh no
B	it's like seventy people queuing for a shower
A	everyone's like vrmmm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	surely to like come to one with your thoughts and actually feel that sense of accomplishment and absolute where you want to be
A	can't they just hose everybody down while they're still in?
B	I don't understand and then people start
A	sarangasana is it sarangasana? I don't know
B	I don't know I can't remember
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	I can't remember the name of it
B	why? Oh the in inverted
A	because I can't
B	oh yeah
A	yeah cos of my neck
B	I'm fine
A	oh that was so annoying in my class yesterday
B	sitting on the side
A	against the wall with our feet up and a bolster under our bum
B	yeah
A	and so he was kinda talking shoulder stand through to the other ones
B	yeah
A	while we were just like relaxing
B	during the class?
A	during the class while he was still trying to give instructions to everybody else
B	yeah
A	I don't think he would have actually said
B	but it is rude isn't it?
A	I thought it was bloody weird
B	lack of etiquette
A	everybody else is there relaxing or they're there trying to hear his instructions and they were just blah blah blah blah blah chat chat chat chat chat
B	I'm quite happy to do that in the cinema
A	but that's better than the passive aggressive evil stares that most people do
B	I do that first but when I get mad then I I'm quite happy to
B	Friday
A	oh well Friday is Ashtanga and I can't go on Sunday cos I'm having lunch with my mum so
B	only thing I would say about the hot yoga class cos I I'm on my ten day pass and that's my last day
A	oh okay
B	the only I would say is if you are gonna come to get a ten day pass cos that's fifteen pounds and then you can even if you have three classes that's five pounds cos otherwise it's
A	yeah
B	it's a bit more isn't it?
A	well
B	oh in
A	that's the one yeah
B	if that's the case then
A	some two week passes I think
B	if if that's the case may I recommend the best yoga class in the world?
A	does
A	where's?
B	ten o'clock to eleven thirty sorry
A	oh the one the
A	really? Ah so she knows
B	yeah
A	ah
B	it was actually you know Swedish
A	yes
B	it was Swedish
A	uh-huh
B	that's the only one that I ever went to but
A	eh I'd definitely go
B	that's obviously cos she's doing it all the time isn't she?
A	yeah
B	I think she is the  I think she is the  best in not that I've been to any or many but I do you know it's the rapport that you get isn't it?
A	yeah
B	that you get and I think she's absolutely the best that I've ever encountered
A	but was just that cos you like the standard or the dynamic yoga?
B	I loved it  I loved it  but I love her teaching method as well
A	mm
B	but I go because I you know I enjoy her class
A	nice
B	so she does from what I remember of
A	aw
A	are there other yoga classes that other people teach at
B	I've moved away from

B	so Monday six thirty to eight is
A	the thing is I'm so unlikely to go somewhere that I have to catch
B	any more buses
A	more than two buses to

B	here
