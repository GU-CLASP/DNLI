B	oh yeah
A	so Dick And Dom In Da House pardon me had a segment that was very much like that
B	oh right
A	like very like get your own back on your parents
B	right
A	and um my favourite bit was uh
A	so like they would go to like an aquarium and they'd be like looking at this you know you know those
B	oh yeah
A	and um then they'd be like bogey like have to shout it really loud
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	um
A	but I love
B	in the tunnel? Why a tunnel though?
A	but I love  I love  children's TV
B	why a tunnel though
B	well some of it's good I mean
A	have you seen Ooglies
B	no I don't think so
A	that's one of my favourites
B	used to like it yeah
A	it's cos with going to work I get up still on a Saturday and Sunday at the same time
B	oh you don't why not  why not?
A	well it's just a little
B	you have such such high standards?
A	well exactly
B	of course
A	um
B	oh yeah
A	not like Teletubbies
B	I mean that's that's totally sort of some you know um
A	oh
B	teletubbies is like being on some kind of strange trip or something
A	mm
B	you know psychedelic
A	have you ever seen I'm Sorry I've Got No Head?
A	I've told you about it
B	but but Horrible Histories is kind of a sketch show isn't it?
A	yeah but
B	oh
A	well just funny funny things
B	okay
A	they've got um
B	well it's a good title
A	some of the people in it like Marcus Brigstocke's in it
B	oh yeah
A	as is um what's he called the guy he's on some of the um NatWest adverts
B	um
A	like he
B	oh um from um Whites yeah?
A	from Whites yeah
B	like yeah he's like the second main guy in Whites after
A	yeah
B	Alan Davies
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah very
B	yeah
A	sorry?
B	the Life Of Brian interview with the  with the  priests
A	oh that's right
B	yeah it was pretty much like it was him and Michael Palin and um
A	who was who played Michael Palin?
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	so the end of the interview and where they sort of walked off
A	yeah
B	um
A	well supposed to be
B	it was  it was  back in the sort of the blasphemy
A	ah
B	they they
A	yeah
B	blasphemy meaning insulting God is that what it is or?
A	yeah
B	yeah um
A	not believing in God yeah
B	these guys had uh blasphemy which was a big you know you could  you could  get uh
A	thing back then? Yeah it's a lot more relaxed now
B	um
A	yeah
B	no not in the seventies no but uh
A	yeah
B	well not in I mean perhaps in in in certain other countries they have uh you know
A	I dunno
B	very strongly religious uh governments
A	Vatican City maybe
B	dunno
A	mm
B	you know you'd get burned for like
A	yeah
B	mind you I suppose like a lot of the times they just made stuff up like if they didn't like someone
A	yeah
B	they would make up you know trumped-up charges
A	telling them she's a witch yeah
B	you know the classic uh
A	yeah
B	trumped-up
A	yeah
B	think they were sort of burned people being burned probably uh
A	but um
B	but if you wanna make money in these hard times televise public execution
A	ah that's a horrible idea
B	pay pay
A	people would though wouldn't they?
B	yep
A	voyeurism?
B	well I I'm not in favour uh I'm not in favour of it but I think in as people get increasingly desperate for money perhaps that's something that'll happen
A	but I mean the television's going like that anyway like some of that stuff that
B	oh yeah well I think we think I don't know if this is just because I'm getting old or
A	mm
B	which I am
A	yeah
B	or if it genuinely is getting worse but
A	Ohh
B	no I haven't no what what what have you  what have you  been reading?
A	maybe it was when I was abroad
B	yeah
A	foreign news
B	I don't  I don't  know if we'd be given any anything that negative about the rebels in England
A	so it was on CNN and they were like um Oh they were like Oh you know they've captured this guy who's supposed to have
B	oh dead body
A	was he wasn't dying at that moment but he would
B	they'd already killed him?
A	and he was just hanging with his tree
B	oh right yeah
A	so
B	very similar to medieval uh
A	exactly
B	well not necessarily medieval
A	but what I'm saying is that was on the news
B	CNN but I dunno if it's
A	yeah
B	the the shooting uh
A	yeah
B	pretty pretty brutal really uh I don't know if um
A	yeah but that's a bit extreme
B	well it could get far worse and we only have to look back in into the horrible history to see just how horrible it could get again in this country
A	yeah but I don't wanna see it
B	remember Mussolini in
A	no I know but
B	he was like strung up and his body was like passed around you know hung up
A	well I know
B	oh well that's I mean that's that's supposedly illegal in the modern um
A	but I think
B	there's there's always
A	but you get horrible stuff anyway
B	I think one of the big problems like violence
A	I know it was proper dive wasn't it I was thinking that wasn't even a penalty no way
B	that's a real that uh
A	didn't he didn't give it though the referee so
B	yeah fair enough
A	doesn't matter
B	oh yeah so
A	it was the right decision
B	no I mean I think like violence is is a  is a  huge problem and uh
A	ooh
B	and it comes from government it comes from individual it comes from you know mobs just just come up and uh
A	yeah
A	I'm sorry I was just just a bit distracted by his glasses they seem really out of place
B	no I don't know
A	no but I think those kinda strong glass you've gotta be have a certain sort of face to be able to like
B	he looks like K C Jones from uh
A	who's K C Jones?
B	he's a business man that was on Dragon's Den
A	is K C Jones not a song by the um
B	I don't know well he called himself K C Jones so
A	is K C Jones? Oh yeah I remember
B	he had very
A	oh
B	um that's a good trick of memory isn't it the way people mix like
A	yeah blend things
B	mix perhaps like a noun with a verb or whatever you might say
A	K C Jones? Was he the one with the microwave that he could microwave his shoes in?
B	yeah he was the guy with the uh um
B	it was funny that
A	I could do with one them let's be honest
B	he had these thick glasses and and he and his eyes were really
A	he was like You put them in a microwave
B	yeah that he really from Birmingham and he he had thick thick rim thick glasses that um
A	well all the best people are don't worry about it
B	uh
A	oh god them stairs in and out all the time
B	population's growing in like some places
A	ay? What?
B	Birmingham
A	what?
B	its population's growing in like some places
A	well yeah
B	uh
A	D'you not think his glasses look really odd?
B	not really
A	I think he'd look better with some of them ones where you can't see the frame
A	God what they doing?
A	in and out all the time
B	yeah actually there is uh can be a bit of repeated uh
A	I don't understand
B	certain amount of repetition sometimes
A	on a Saturday morning when I'm trying to have a lie in they're like boof boof boof boof up the stairs
B	what was I saying to you? Well I don't I think there's someone who who likes to sort of
A	aye
B	redo things
A	have they got like loads of stuff like they're just carrying it up in shifts?
B	not sure
B	presumably
B	uh no I think I thought they left
A	I dunno
B	they can't just be like hovering there can they?
B	oh yeah so I was saying um
A	stupid advert's got in me head
B	that that that there's that violence is just  is just  it's so easy to get a situation of violence you know
A	yeah
B	even in  even in  the richest country in the world or or even in the most supposedly peaceful country in the world
A	if someone
B	like Norway or something
A	yeah
B	which I believe has the highest standard of living in Europe in the world perhaps or in Europe or something
A	oh right
B	and probably one of the the world
A	but
B	but but you know you get you got that shooting and
A	ah but you get crackers peoples everywhere don't you?
B	well it's the biggest attack in Norway since you know the Nazis
A	yeah but you can't predict that like it's just
B	no but I mean I guess that's part of my point that the violence violence seems to
A	but
B	can just have
A	yeah
B	well I
A	well both both really
B	so you're happy with the violence but no as long as it's
A	no I've just said both haven't I
B	is it cos I was talking about like the violence itself as
A	I don't see why you should perpetuate it on the TV I think it's like
B	oh yeah well if you're taking the point that that that like that that can cause more violence yeah
A	well they say it don't they like they say if there's like a serial
B	it can  it can  yeah
A	if you're a serial killer
B	yeah indeed but then of course violence starts otherwise without TV
A	that's quite a good advert
A	violence starts  everywhere I suppose
A	I like those cars that have got them big sunroofs like that
B	mm
A	me dad's got them
B	and I looked and I found uh a lot of the violence is to do with um places where there's drugs produced or
A	Congo? Ah yeah
B	also gangs and and in it involved in the transport of drugs um
A	yeah
A	like um like that programme we watched about that guy who was like he got done over
B	sorry I don't know what you mean
A	he was like an American guy and he fell in love with that girl? And she was just using him
B	oh right
A	banged Up Abroad
B	well that's that's not a case of violence it's a case of stupidity and uh
A	it's pretty stupid
B	drugs
A	hey look at
B	Florida seems to be a real hotbed of of just just craziness I think but uh um
A	are you?
B	but
A	ah it's pretty bad
B	so that's like yeah
A	were they?
B	carrying out the
A	well you can't say that just cos two things've happened and just cos that's you've heard about them
B	although I think
A	just cos you've heard about them like
B	well I think it is because and uh this is what I'm on about is that the drugs route you see
A	oh that looks good doesn't it?
B	the drugs that
A	oh right
B	America consumes an enormous amount of drugs and those drugs probably most of them are coming from South America yeah so obviously so anywhere along the
A	yeah
B	is is particularly I mean Florida particularly because perhaps it's got such a big coastline
A	oh yeah
B	this beautiful  girl you know
A	she's been
B	she's been uh left or something
A	her husband had beat her up or something hadn't he? Or there was something
B	she she has to to
A	she needed somewhere to go um
B	she desperately needs um
A	escape from somewhere
B	something it was she
A	yeah
B	then once he's fallen in love he becomes the perfect uh transporter for drugs
A	yeah
B	because in the words of the guy like in the words  in the words  of one of those
A	hey Matt d'you wanna go to um Peru?
B	yeah well
A	I'm sorry I'm only joking
B	you're uh
A	ee
B	I mean
A	Don't be silly
B	you know I think you can never trust anyone um
A	of course you can
B	it's uh
A	do you really think that?
B	if you'd done if you'd um
B	um I don't know I mean
A	Don't be silly
B	how could you make the money back and you'd have to be
A	I'll sell you into slavery or something
B	and sort of sell all my uh
A	organs yeah
B	organs yeah
A	did you see about the guy in the news who'd got that full-on face transplant
B	um don't remember
A	it was almost like a full-on head transplant
A	his jaw  All like his upper and lower jaw
B	oh god
A	if you're stupid enough to shoot yourself in the face you don't deserve a face
A	I hope that's the case
B	well he presumably he is was that on uh American uh
A	I think it was yeah
B	NHS but I guess
A	well I think it was destroying his life like he couldn't go out the house and stuff because obviously
B	yeah I'm not not a big fan of shooting myself though I think
A	waay
B	no I mean that that was a  that was a
A	no you gotta say Shooting myself myself
B	that I that wasn't deliberate but uh
A	there was a few of them funny little things
B	very cautious around a gun I certainly wouldn't be like throwing it around
A	na
B	but if you've had a  you've had a  few beers
A	I suppose if you go
B	if you decided to go for a few beers
A	yeah
B	it's uh
A	like
B	yeah but if you're drunk you can still shoot yourself in the face
A	shooting yourself in the face is not
B	there's some bizarre
A	you know like in
B	because uh sometimes they would  they would  pull the trigger and there'd be a pause
A	oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	big big
A	like this like
B	yeah
B	there's a few  a few  of those sorts of gags like uh when they
A	or like um in Tom and Jerry
B	you know Wile E Coyote on the  on the  edge of the cliff
A	Tom and Jerry like often his skin comes off or something
B	yeah I mean it's it's it's horribly violent isn't it but
A	yeah
B	like the Marge complains it's too violent and wants it banned
A	yeah
B	or was it? No no Michelangelo's David
A	yeah
B	um which is totally naked sculpture
A	yeah
B	comes to America and someone says that if you're banning uh if you're in favour of banning the violence then you'll have to be in favour of banning nudity um
A	nudity?
B	you know
A	some of them Tom and Jerry ones are classic though I don't mean the violent ones
B	like you you can't equate  you can't equate  as I think that cartoon was trying to do
A	yeah
B	you know freedom of expression nudity with with violence that that's stupid
A	yeah
B	oh yeah well that's been like a theme though that's that's been a theme though that's been
A	but um
B	you know there's plenty to say about that isn't there
A	my favourite  my favourite  Tom and Jerry one
B	um I
A	ah that's a good one
B	um I I I suppose I wasn't a massive fan of those short cartoons I tended to prefer
A	the Hanna Barbera ones?
B	I tended to prefer um longer films and uh
A	oh is it? It's funny that you like longer things maybe that's your character
B	but at that time I did
A	you mean like serials? Series?
B	no I mean like like films or
A	oh I see
B	um
A	must have had a good attention span
B	no I dunno if I
A	yeah you do
B	um
A	for some things
B	there were some films that I really liked actually but I think um that I wasn't allowed to watch them or something and that that made me frustrated um
A	yeah
B	uh but I remember
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	um collecting like my favourite films
A	I liked um
B	oh yeah yeah
A	I don't even know if I've seen it all the way though
B	I tried to show it to you but uh
A	I know what was years ago
B	uh and I think you fell asleep
A	that sounds about right
B	it's uh yeah it's a pretty boring film
A	but um
B	no I really love the the the comedy uh like
A	oh
B	when I saw it as a child I liked it
A	is there an under the sea bit?
B	yeah
A	there's some things I that I really should've seen
B	it's it was like it was done after um Mary Poppins and I think a lot of people say
A	Mary Bobbins
B	A lot of people say that Mary Poppins
A	ah I love Dick Van Dyke
B	uh tremendous isn't he?
A	and his son
B	it's funny that they sort of do these kinda like
A	he's
B	like like Grade Grade F sort of like drama series and
A	everyone loves Dick Van Dyke
B	but yeah it makes loads of money
A	I watched a really good one the other day Diagnosis Murder
B	little Little Jimmy Van Dyke
A	three generations of Van Dykes in the same family in the same thing
B	Great
A	oh it was really bad like the acting was so terrible it was really good to watch like really cringey and rubbish
B	he was  he was  kind of good in um Mary Poppins but
A	Mary Bobbins
B	can you imagine him playing like a serial killer or something?
A	no
B	like like You talking to me?
A	well he's a good dancer though
B	no I suppose he could do like a
A	he he was  he was  a really good dancer you know
B	that he he he like
B	you come come
A	you come to me this day
B	imagine if if they took Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels and replaced some of the main  the main  characters with like Disney uh like Dick Van
A	with Dick Van Dyke
B	the the
A	or like um
B	wow that's a weird goal
A	aww
B	it wasn't a goal anyway
A	was it? Was it offside? Yeah
B	oh yeah he he's way offside there
A	oh yeah
A	oh it's awful
B	just goes and follows it
A	like finger tipped it
B	extremely rich
A	yeah but it's that both that early afternoon thing for like nanas
B	oh yeah I suppose
A	but actually Angela Lansbury
B	there was a lot of money though though there were really really loads of viewers for that sort of thing like Colombo and
A	but Murder She Wrote's really good yeah
B	there were like the some of the most viewed programmes on on TV
A	and
B	yeah there's there's loads of money in that like
A	but Angela Lansbury was um a highly acclaimed Broadway actress
B	well no I think she  I think she  is a was a is a good actor
A	I read um her Wikipedia page not so long ago
B	oh right
A	what's her name in? What's the?
B	Dick Van Dyke
A	Mary Bobbins
B	I'd only really
A	what's her name  what's her name  in um? What's her name in Murder She
B	chim chimeney chim chim
A	there's a
B	Jessica Fletcher
A	oh Jessica Fletcher
B	ah but I
A	I know
B	some
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh I was gonna tell you about my Tom and Jerry favourite one
B	um
A	ah that's definitely the best one
B	is that your favourite one?
A	I'm gonna look at that one after
B	ah we watched a few cartoons actually we did we watched uh
A	oh yeah
B	Droopy
A	Droopy
B	uh that was funny
A	I like  I like  that the plot of that though how he's always like like This goes on for the whole cartoon you know like he he always
A	he's like I get him in the end
B	uh
A	do your Droopy voice
B	um they they always uh
A	yeah
B	like he always sort of tortoises them really quickly and then gets there before them
A	it's funny
B	and then he's tremendously sort of nonchalant about it or whatever
A	that one
B	he was
A	tha's right
B	ah
A	and he kept like and the guy like got on a train and on a bus and on a plane and
B	he he would yeah he would release them and he'd say Wait in this room and then the guy says Oh yeah I'll just wait in this room and the runs runs and
A	then he was at like the North Pole runs to the North Pole and he's already there
B	and just Droopy just uh
A	Droopy's already got there
B	yeah he's always sort of already there isn't he?
A	it's funny
B	um
A	yeah
B	I used to like Dastardly And Mutley you know uh
A	yeah
B	catch The Pigeon
A	um she had like this television in her bedroom that was black and white and um sometimes I would wake up really and obviously she would be like Aw
A	I used to watch it for ages
B	ah yeah well I had a black and while TV till uh till I was about was it like eight or nine or something
A	well you can get like three
B	oh
A	Nn nn
B	how does that work then? I don't know much about optics to be honest
A	I dunno it's just technical advances
B	you could what?
A	one of the bairns had one at Christmas it was like a Nintendo thing
B	no
A	at Christmas?
B	uh don't
A	like
B	oh I've probably been uh if if I'd have kept my distance
A	no no I showed it to you cos I it was interesting
B	oh right
A	it as like a
B	Cos wouldn't you sort of always have it on like maximally 3D?
A	no cos sometimes like it just looked a bit weird
B	I don't think
A	might be a bit
B	well I've only seen one thing ever on 3D and that was uh
A	that didn't really agree with you either
B	it cost about twenty quid
A	aye for both of us
B	see um
A	we're not gonna pay twenty pound each
B	no it felt like  it felt like  a load of it felt like more money than than I was expecting
A	no it was I think it was ten pounds each yeah which is a lot of money considering we could've probably bought it on DVD for five quid
B	it was a good  it was a good  film though
A	was a good
B	yeah yeah
A	but then I  then I  sort of watching it again like it just made us think like Oh this is really cheesy
B	it's quite
A	when it's like unobtainium
B	well
A	Liz was telling us she'd been to see that film Hunger Games
B	no
A	I I think it might have one of them vampire blokes in
B	oh yeah I know  I know  who you mean
A	you know who I mean? That kind of pasty-faced sort of
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	sort of spooky
B	kinda scary scary eyes
A	well vampirey isn't he? Let's be honest
B	like what you imagine a vampire the the Romanian look
A	so I think it might've had him in but I'm not sure
B	guess Dracula tradition it has a sort of a long nose
A	aww what a goal
B	wow
A	ah that was good
B	that was uh Raul
A	ah that's that's good uh they're not expected to win are they Schalke?
B	really long um really long strike
A	that was really good
B	against uh
A	did it not come off his hand though?
B	it's cos it was a volley as well so that made it um
A	it was like aye
B	A volley from the edge of the penalty area
A	oh the goalie couldn't even see that like it was like too many people in the way
B	wasn't happy
A	I sometimes think some of these British commentators when it's a European match they're like Yeah
B	just bored of it
A	no they're not it's kind of flat
B	got to get excited like
A	I feel like I should put the German commentary on
B	well like Jeff Stelling was always sort of excited about like
A	he doesn't sound like he's from Germany does he Ral González
B	um
A	yeah
B	well we we do we don't have like you know you are allowed to move country
A	well that's true
B	um
A	and you can call kids whatever you want
B	Cos you've got uh  you've got uh  Messi from he's from uh Argentina isn't he?
A	yeah
B	he he plays in Barcelona plays for Barcelona
A	you have to be allowed to work though
B	sorry?
A	not anyone can go anywhere
B	oh you have to get a like visa
A	yeah
B	it's only New Zealand
A	I know
B	but uh
A	what d'you mean?
B	within that
A	yeah couple of weirdoes
B	weirdness somewhere and uh I've
A	yeah that's that's true
B	um in fact it's I I'd be surprised if people aren't even more weird than uh
A	well
B	than we  than we  think they are really
A	maybe they're just keeping it on the inside
B	yeah I think a lot of people are pretty
A	yeah
B	literally uh literally on the edge of uh on the edge of reason
A	well
B	you seen that film?
A	on the edge Edge Of Reason? Bridget Jones?
B	yeah
A	have you? You a Bridget Jones fan underneath?
B	um I don't think so I was like
A	I do like a nice Bridget Jones pant
A	but uh no
B	and um
A	it's very much a girls' film and I'm not really into girls' films
B	right
A	but I have seen it and I don't mind it
B	um what is it about girls' films that annoys you?
A	oh they're kind of just saccharine just like floppiness
A	women women always are Oh oh help me and like Oh I've fallen in love and like
B	I don't  I don't  think that
A	well name name like a rom com where the woman's like
B	Meg Ryan
A	oh right
B	everything Meg Ryan's ever done
A	I'm not sure if Meg Ryan's like a flagship feminist though
B	well

A	alright sorry for being
B	like um
B	no no no no uh
A	that's not very nice
B	that's better than you know like I said like someone who just ah it's nothing worse than uncomfortable silences like
A	yeah
B	like if you're sitting with someone and you you happen to be like going out with them or like living with them and it's just like  just like  like just endless like pin dropping silences
A	yeah
B	I guess you're not used to a
A	no
B	he's a  he's a  a tremendous talker uh
A	chats away
B	and I think  I think
A	oh me nana
B	is is really
A	I'm sure like when me granda was in hospital he must have just been like aahhh
B	so yes so you're
A	I wrote something like that because
B	so you don't  you don't  identify with with women like like Rachel from Friends or?
A	not really it's not very me
B	suppose not
A	um
B	you're not that clean though
A	no
B	yeah but not
A	I think I'm sentimental and I do think I'm an old
B	do you if you see uh if you see like you know something something nice on TV like like that programme with uh those you know they get a little kid and he's suffered a personal tragedy
A	yeah
B	they build him a big house to make up for it
A	ahh
B	yeah
A	but that's something quite different to like
A	and those sort of stupid Marley And Me or like um
B	things with Hugh Grant in?
A	clueless
B	D'you like um Four Weddings And A Funeral which I think is the most successful British film um
A	I don't mind Hugh Grant but uh
B	no I think it's between
A	I I don't mind
B	is it one of the recent ones?
A	no it's not Titanic that was an American one
B	Titanic's not a British film
A	I know
B	um
A	ah
B	possibly
A	wasn't it?
B	there have been some very very big ones recently um
A	I'm gonna find out
B	like
A	what d'you think it is?
B	I I like those lists
A	what d'you think it is? What's your bet then?
B	uh the the biggest grossing British so called British made film even though I believe often the money is
A	yeah
B	the the
A	is it is Slumdog a British film?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I don't think they're British
A	no?
B	Don't think so no
A	yeah
B	eh uh the biggest British film of all time
A	hundred best
B	something with Hugh Grant in
A	top a hundred British films
A	I dunno
B	what about stuff like like um Shakespeare In Love or uh? Um
A	oh this is just a
B	oh no I don't wanna see
A	uh so it's biggest grossing? Is that what you would say d'you think?
B	yeah biggest grossing British film like hold hold on let me give us  give us  a chance to work out some answers here
A	alright
B	uh
A	um
B	press what?
A	I've searched for it but I and I've got some pages but I'm not gonna
B	um
A	I haven't seen it it's with that guy what's he called?
B	is it
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there was Lock Stock and Snatch like um
A	yeah Lock Stock that was pretty big
B	they were quite quite very like critically acclaimed like uh they were
A	were there any other? Um
B	hold on hold on what about uh Harry Potter?
A	oh yeah
B	is that that cos that if that's British made then that would undoubtedly be like Harry Potter One and Harry Potter Two Harry Potter Three Harry Potter Four like the top
A	I can't
B	the top ten's just gonna be like all Harry Potter
A	D'you think so? I dunno if they're British though
B	uh Lord Of The Rings is not British made
A	I think they were made here but is it
B	that's something that I don't actually understand
A	oh right
B	I dunno
A	ah hang on UK highest grossing movies but that is not just mean the highest
B	in the UK? Yeah that would that's what that would mean
A	I have
B	have you gone to Google or Wikipedia?
A	Google
B	uh hold on um
A	aww
B	oh
A	oh I didn't see that
B	Athletico have uh pulled one back
A	I quite like Athletico because well cos of the Sunderland link
B	yeah
A	but I also wanted Schalke to win because they're the sort of underdogs
B	oh right
A	what d'you think in the
B	oh have you got  have you got  British film industry on there cos
A	no I've
B	Cos if you go to British economy
A	british Film Institute?
B	no not the British Film Institute it's just an organization
A	no no
B	uh
A	yeah
B	like um
A	yeah
B	several companies would work together like I think Slumdog Millionaire was a collaboration of uh different ones
A	british Film Institute
B	no but it's not uh d'you wanna um pass it here so I can have a go?
A	no I'm alright I've got the British Film Institute open now
B	have you? No no there's no point the British Film Institute
A	that's what you told me to search for
B	no I didn't
A	ah
B	the British Film Institute is just an organization that
A	yeah well
B	D'you wanna pass it here?
A	no I'm alright thanks
A	but
A	Don't be silly
B	well
A	films would be in that article in but I'd have to weed through the whole thing wouldn't I?
B	ay? D'you wanna pass it here?
A	I'd have to weed through
B	um
A	ah right
B	uh Harry Potter one to eight and
A	okay I'm on the British film industry page now
B	right
A	so in the bit
B	ooh
A	I dunno it just doesn't say there's not a list
B	are you on the economy thing?
A	yeah I've just got the British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking
B	did did did you Google it?
A	yeah
B	did you Google it?
A	yeah yeah
B	if you go to Wikipedia Britain
A	that seems like such an obscure way to go round it though
B	no because it'll mention cos because that's one quite a big aspect of
A	really? I don't think it is
B	I think it is
A	no I'm fine
B	you you keep saying no but you sort of you keep failing to produce the
A	well I'm just doing what you
B	no
A	have they?
B	no they haven't
A	no um
A	I'm just  I'm just  doing what you telled us
B	there's no point doing that cos like you won't get
A	what?
B	uh what I told you was to give it to me so
A	no but I'm just typing what you would type so I'm not doing anything wrong
A	because I wanna type cos I'll just be sitting here doing nothing if you were doing it
B	yeah but we
A	right
B	you really are uh insane  holding that thing
A	economy of Great Britain
B	we're looking for the top
B	highest grossing British films
B	so you're on the economy of UK where are you?
A	I'm up to history macroeconomic trends currency exports
B	uh could be yeah
A	um
A	sectors yeah
B	service yeah creative industry yeah yeah
A	no it just says Creative industries account for seven percent and grew an average of six percent per annum
B	well that's that's quite a high percentage overall isn't it? Um
A	um
B	go go to Harry Potter and we'll do it the other way round we'll
A	Harry Potter? But is it made by a British company?
B	well we'll find out
A	I could just look up the hundred best
B	uh
A	um
B	well I
A	no it's alright
B	have
A	alright
B	or
A	british film
B	british film company
A	that won't give us any indication of like
B	I think they would just call them British films don't they? I'm surprised it's
A	biggest
B	Cos normally there'd
A	well I'm not lying honestly
B	alright that wasn't uh
A	biggest box office
B	um
A	I'll close that now
B	uh just like what company made it?
A	um
A	have you read them all the Harry Potter ones?
B	oh I don't like it
A	the films? Okay
B	um
A	Warner Brothers
B	oh right
A	produced by David Hayman distributed by Warner Brothers
B	the companies that
A	Harry Potter is a British American film series
B	yeah I mean British like I think that's part of the problem
B	like
A	list of highest grossing films? I might get it from there
B	um
A	used to be Titanic didn't it?
B	Lord of the
A	avatar?
B	Lord of the Rings and or or um
A	avatar maybe?
B	uh Harry Potter or Star Wars the um
A	highest grossing films
B	it was  it was  Titanic wasn't it?
A	avatar
B	oh Avatar
A	well it's difficult because of the adjustment like
B	is that just in their own? Is that excluding
A	no that was just I was reading them out
B	that was a great goal actually the way they they sort of built up
A	aww
B	some very good passing there
A	yeah
B	um can I have a go ah
A	it wasn't a very nice
B	so it it would have been  it would have been  Harry Potter wouldn't it if if that
A	but that it's a British American film
B	I think they all are collaborative like
A	I want to say Harry Potter in my Dick Van Dyke voice
B	Harry
A	Harry Potter
A	hairy Bodder
B	ah but he actually would fit in into that
A	I know
B	he'd fit into that film
A	I could imagine him being like an old wizard
B	I think this film's grossed like the GDP of you know
A	Ireland?
B	Italy or something
A	whoa d'you think Schalke can come back from this?
B	uh two point seven million
A	gah two point seven billion?
B	um
A	dollars?
B	there are probably countries that uh
A	oh I'm sure
B	that that would struggle to have uh a positive uh you know Particularly countries that are in debt
A	yeah
B	struggle to turn over that
A	we saw one of the Harry Potters at Christmas though didn't we? Which one was that? D'you remember?
B	oh yeah cinema of the United Kingdom
A	the one where she winds where he winds a watch back?
B	which one's that?
A	hermione get like um that stopwatch?
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	like one after the other and um
A	God that'll take ages there's eight of them
B	uh
A	but by the time he's eighteen like surely that's quite a different film from like the first one?
B	yeah
A	I hate it when they do that you know when they roll around
B	the list of British
A	oh he's just wasting time isn't he?
A	see? He agrees
B	well yeah cos we've got sort of seven minutes left and
A	yeah he's just time wasting
B	but but it'll get added on though so
A	yeah
B	uh
B	um
A	cor it's a big stadium
B	there's a lot about uh some of the the harror
A	oh yeah
B	um
A	are they
B	uh they well they've done it they they did um
A	recently?
B	they did uh no no not recently they did like a a new one a new Psycho
A	oh
B	that's a good way to make loads of money isn't it?
A	aww he's oh aww he nearly put that in there did you see?
B	highest grossing British films
A	I like it when the football players have really long names
B	like what?
A	like Popodofolofokofalouhlus
B	oh
A	and they have to like wrap it round all of their back?
B	oh yeah
A	aww
B	yeah yeah
A	in like a spiral
B	no
A	think it's stupid
B	it's better to
A	I'd rather make up a new name
B	sorted and then
A	like get the two names and like make an anagram
B	um
A	or just choose a different name
B	oh it says on this one Mamma Mia became the biggest grossing British film
A	there we have it
B	no no no that was only from two thousand and eight
A	yeah
B	uh sorry what what did you say then?
A	I was just being stupid
B	Claire Guacamole
A	turn it off
