A	no alright then
B	not paperwork
A	no
B	is that rain? what's that noise?
A	yeah I think the thunder is coming again
B	that's hail
B	mm
A	it's not as bad
B	mm
A	well I'm not going out again then
B	what tonight?
A	well
A	not going I was gonna go shopping wasn't I?
A	yeah well I
A	I've spent the whole day trying to fucking sort out this Logic thing
A	I figured out that well first of all I was I was playing the guitar
B	woah ah ah
A	and then I've tried everything I've been troubleshooting I've been reading all the guides for Logic
A	looking at all these help pages and I've written to people and
B	have you written to the help people there?
A	no
B	I'm sure they'd be good cos
A	yeah
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	like the up-to-date ones
B	yeah
A	that's made no difference
B	mm
A	so I mean it's an old keyboard if if you think I got it in
B	yeah I know but it should still work
A	it's like
B	yeah but
A	quite old in
B	but it's only a keyboard
A	but it works on my PC
B	it's only a keyboard what more
A	erm
B	it's still
A	well I dunno but I download
B	it's
A	this other thing
B	mm
A	and I've got no signal coming through
B	mm
A	so either I think the power's not sufficient in the cable
B	well that would be silly I think because
A	yeah
B	it's still USB and it's still a keyboard
A	yeah
B	all of the jazzy stuff you do on a computer so there's no need for it to be updated in any way
A	well no
B	just a
A	well no no if you look at all the
B	have you got
A	loads of knobs
B	but you do all of that on the computer so there's no need for that
A	yeah yeah
B	maybe
A	from the midi out socket which I have
B	yeah
A	to USB maybe that will be the problem
B	yeah
A	cos I don't know if that has a different power
B	but then you can buy the cable
A	yeah
B	no no you don't wanna do that
A	but it's it's crap
B	there's no point in doing that cos you won't learn how to play a keyboard
A	no
B	it's just pointless pressing A B C
A	mm
B	yeah
A	just play one octave
B	no
A	well it's annoying cos it works on the PC
A	it's just on the Mac
B	maybe it's the Mac that needs the erm midi output
A	yeah
A	that's what I'm thinking
B	yeah
A	I've tried everything else
B	ooh
A	I don't think I am because that test I had no
B	yeah
A	when I was pressing the keys so
B	well you better stop doing it
A	well yeah I am cos my head
A	you know when you've been staring at a computer all day?
B	yeah you
A	my head's fucked
B	yeah I'd give it a break for a few days
A	I just wanna get started with it
A	well with the drum you need the keyboard
B	why?
A	if you're making your own beats
A	oh
B	I thought that's what it was for
A	yeah but then if I recorded my own drum
B	yeah
A	no but it's difficult to quantise it
B	but I thought the whole idea was to have your unique style of drumming
A	yeah
B	recorded and made in
A	no I am gonna get to that but I can't start with that because I need to learn how how it all works
B	oh okay
A	so I just need to start with a basic drum machine and
B	yeah
A	figure out
B	you should do the chords
A	what's going on
A	which has taken six days
B	yeah
A	yeah but
B	so he's only just started making music too? oh
A	yeah
A	well he's a decent bassist
A	but he wants to
A	I think he's got a couple of projects with people making people
B	it is a rice cooker stroke some sort of slow cooker
A	mm
B	but it's not
A	mm
B	but it'll cook rice
B	I don't believe that how blunt she is
B	she's really really
A	mm
B	all the same
A	mm
B	so she's got the same
B	so she's
B	it's like well our house isn't that bad come on I know but she knows the trouble we've had with the landlady so and she you know all the stupid things the landlady
A	mm
A	but we're paying less than everyone else as well aren't we?
B	yeah
A	does she know that?
B	well a little bit
B	one room
A	yeah
B	I like
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos she's so direct
B	she just says it about everything I couldn't believe when she said about my rice
B	it wasn't that bad
A	no
B	I've made worse rice than that
A	well I suppose being Chinese you're quite picky about your rice
B	plus about your rice yeah well she doesn't even like the rice that she cooks in the saucepan she's never done it in a saucepan before
A	really
B	she's never never cooked rice in a saucepan before
A	so did she buy that thing or you?
B	er well
B	I was going to buy a cheap rice cooker for her
A	yes okay
B	and you can keep it warm so you could make soup
A	mm
B	kind of soup vegetable soup just throw ins some vegetables throw in some water just switch it on
A	yeah
B	make some soup and then you could just keep it warm for
A	mm
B	if it's vegetable soup you could keep just keep it warm quite a lot can't you?
A	mm
B	for
A	yeah
B	I like her cooking
A	yeah I mean some people love cooking so if she wants to cook
B	if she wants to cook
A	our lunch
B	yeah
A	that's brilliant
A	yeah
B	cos I cooked bread and stuff for lunch
A	well she was probably bugger this I'll cook my own
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	I didn't think it was that bad it was just a bit sticky that's all but
A	well it was Thai sticky rice wasn't it?
A	no
B	how did I do it any different to her? but apparently I did
A	mm
B	couldn't believe it
B	well what? you can't say that I'm paying you to come round here
B	I pay you to come round and like my rice
B	it's just weird
B	oh
A	so what was
B	cleaning
A	oh
B	cleaning
A	mm
B	er so I'm gonna be at home so I want you to cook clean and do the ironing
B	I don't do ironing and I I I don't really cook
B	I'll look after your children and you do that
A	yeah
B	erm to come and help us not not take the children
A	yeah
B	yeah and I've got
A	oh really?
B	oh well I don't know
A	cos she was horrible
B	I don't know but she said erm
A	yeah
A	yeah then within ten minutes asked for a pay rise
A	for a job she hasn't even been offered
B	yeah
A	right I want a pay rise twenty percent in the first year
B	twenty percent in the first year?
A	it's like hang on a minute what's your name?
B	yeah
A	god
B	do we want to hire you first?
A	mm
B	but it is we've been spoilt like this I do feel really spoilt
B	er and I was like yeah I know but I like I like the woman who comes and washes the floor
B	and er
A	ah
B	she said you don't have to keep her if you don't want and I said er I don't know once a week
A	well no I
B	once a week to iron your shirts and wash the floor
B	nice little bit
A	yeah
B	of extra money for her and a little bit of
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and I don't know I just like it I feel very spoilt though
A	no cos
B	I said if we're if I'm at work all day you're at work all day and
A	no exactly I'd rather her spend her time with
B	yeah
A	no
B	yeah
A	no I mean we can do most of the cleaning and it's just that once a week
B	mm
A	you know just clean the floors or whatever
B	yeah
A	iron my shirts
B	so spoilt
A	god I feel like such a colonial pig
B	oh I feel really bad too I said it's just so weird
A	no but it
B	well
A	we're only gonna be away couple of hours each day
B	they don't have nurseries so
A	no
B	they don't have nurseries so what else can you do? you have someone at your house looking after them that's it
B	yeah
A	it's just been when we were
B	if we were at home
A	oh yeah but it'd cost you a bloody fortune at home
B	yeah
A	no we wouldn't be able to do it at home you wouldn't
B	you're a lucky girl
A	you wouldn't be able to work at all
B	do you know how lucky you are having a nanny huh? having a nanny?
B	an
A	when does language acquisition start when's she gonna start picking up Chinese?
B	but do you know I thought because you know how she copied your intonation?
A	mm
B	with the open close thing
B	open close
B	the intonations just the the fact that there's
A	tones
B	yeah
A	yeah but we have tones we just use them in a different way
B	yeah no that's what I
A	so what's the difference her being here and at home?
A	wouldn't develop faster
B	ah mm really? they do they are
A	well only in terms of the meaning of the vocab
B	just the yeah
A	I mean our intonation's based on
B	er
A	is in questions or statements or
B	okay in open wide you go open close
A	emotion
B	cos it's unfinished when you say open
A	erm
B	closed
A	yeah
B	that you're playing
A	yeah
B	you wouldn't say I've closed the door
B	I've closed the door
A	yeah that's just individual iambs isn't it?
B	yeah so it's only when you've finished your utterance or whatever that you would use intonation like that
A	yeah
B	so it's not every single word that you're that you've got a
A	yeah
B	or a
A	yeah
B	yeah so that's why
B	not every word but
A	I had a look on Facebook earlier
A	did I tell you someone nominated me?
B	yeah
A	I'm not doing it
A	firstly I hate
B	firstly you don't own a bucket
B	yeah
A	it scares me
B	they don't want to
A	it's
B	they don't want to be seen as not doing it
A	I mean I give money to charity but not because everyone else is
B	yeah
A	I choose
B	people think you're a stingy old bastard if you don't do it
A	I don't care if that's what they think
B	but do you care what they think?
A	no
B	who was it nominated you anyway?
A	my cousin in
B	well
A	but erm
B	she's gonna think you're a stingy old bastard
B	you don't have to post it you can just say I did it
A	you don't even have to say that you just do it and give the money why why why the need to shove it down everyone's throat?
B	well how you gonna nominate the extra three people
A	that's what I don't like
B	mm
A	no
B	yeah they are that's the whole point of it
