A	so are you living still with the the housemate that you found back in October?
B	yes
B	er oh
A	you remember when you went to see it?
B	did I say that?
A	you remember when we saw those hovels?
B	yes
A	oh
B	two flatmates
A	but wasn't it er just living with one woman?
B	mm
A	or is that a different place?
B	mm
A	ah
B	which I probably should've taken
A	I was under the impression that you'd
B	oh
A	gone with that
B	the nice one
A	one you see
B	no
A	I thought it was all swish
B	no
A	so was it cheaper? This other place?
B	this place is cheaper but I've got I've been locked into a contract until the end of June
A	oh dear
B	probably I have to pay until June
A	how much is it?
B	three hundred no yeah including bills and internet and everything it's three hundred and ten per month
A	that's not too bad with bills and stuff
B	yeah
A	oh
B	so it's really close
A	perfect
B	yeah
B	do you you know where
A	yeah
B	it's it was there
A	uh-huh
B	um and that considering it was five hundred and fifty per month
A	oh right
B	um
A	okay
A	that was a lot more expensive
B	yeah
A	mm
B	which would've been better
A	what happens if you break your contract? Have you given them a deposit?
B	I don't know
A	I mean that's
B	I don't actually know
A	SE hmm
B	but that's quite hard
A	and how many months er rent do they have from you for
B	one month's
A	as a deposit?
B	deposit
A	mhm
B	so we've been days sometimes weeks without hot water and heating
A	oh no
B	yeah
A	yep
B	and they're still not replacing the boiler
A	why don't you just refuse to pay your rent until he sorts it out?
B	so we've that's what we've now said that we're gonna do
A	is it a private landlord? Or?
B	no it's
A	mm
B	and the agency won't hear of us not paying
A	yeah but I mean at the end of the day if they're not it could be a way of getting out of your contract
B	that's this so in January when it was really bad over Christmas
A	oh no
B	there was a week that there was cold water
A	it was so cold as well wasn't it
B	it was freezing
A	uh-huh
B	and only one of the girls in the house qualifies for legal aid being free because if you earn over a if you have a certain amount in savings you can't get free legal aid
A	oh okay
B	so it's all up to her
A	yeah
B	it has to be done properly
A	and have you  have you  got any er is there not a legal adviser in the university housing association?
B	no
A	Cos can you is there not?
B	no
A	mm
B	and they've just kind of gone well we can't do anything
B	um I
A	well they're obviously fixing trying to fix something that can't be fixed
B	basically
A	and in your contract does it say that the that they are responsible for upkeeping the I don't know what they'd call it the
B	there's a yeah the like
A	fixtures and fittings
B	yeah
A	and
B	I mean like it's one of those contracts which is like thirty statements long
A	well if there's no hot water
B	hot water
A	and no heating that's hardly habitable is it?
B	they keep saying to us oh summer's coming soon
A	well why don't you just try and get a lawyer to just get advice to say look they've broken the contract in that they haven't kept the house habitable um I want to write them a letter saying
B	Don't I have to pay for that?
A	in consideration
B	that's why we're trying to go through the legal aid thing
A	or just ask er ask the question
B	it's been intermittent since December
A	then that's you know that's not they're breaking the contract
B	I think we talked to the landlord recently
A	oh
B	she started off really angry and then she sort of calmed down
B	come on woman
A	mm
B	which is kind of the idea
A	well that's the thing
B	yeah
A	this is
B	all of this
A	compromising my ability to concentrate
B	at home
A	twenty miles
B	yeah
A	um
B	but
A	reason I would like to dissolve the contract based on the fact that you haven't respected
B	I er that's actually I think pretty much been said
A	can you not? SE What about the Citizens Advice Bureau?
B	that's yeah that's why we're going
A	oh okay
B	which takes time and I mean they're booking us an appointment and the girl has to go in and see them
A	yeah
B	and I can just go home whenever
A	hm
B	yeah I know I I don't know what I think one of them goes to her boyfriend's and the other one probably goes to a friend's but
A	it's not typical
A	it's not er oh what's the word? It's not an ideal situation
B	yeah
A	there you go
A	not an ideal situation when you
B	I'm like what are you trying to say?
A	I don't know what I'm
B	no it's not an ideal situation
A	especially when you've got so much else to deal with
B	huh
A	oh yeah? Where?
B	Japan
A	oh
B	um
A	mm
B	from there
A	mm
B	but I really wanted to get some done before I left
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? Cos I'm trying to get them to move into this hell hole
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	I mean
A	the slug palace
B	Morocco was interesting
A	how long did you go for?
B	four days
A	oh it was a quick quick trip
B	it was a very quick trip
B	woah prepositions um in London at midnight
A	oh no
B	and I was just like oh mate I'm gonna kill you
A	and how was the Morocco part of the journey? SE
B	I was kind of surprised
A	really? Where were you?
B	marrakesh
A	uh-huh
B	um
A	really?
B	in terms of
A	well it's better than what you've got at the moment
B	yeah I know
A	little republic of third world
B	yes
A	and did you see anything nice? Or buy anything nice?
B	oh my friend wanted to go
A	uh-huh
B	in the souqs and the markets
A	no
B	what?
A	I know
B	oh that sucks
A	we'd already got the tickets
B	huh
A	and everything
B	that's really bad
A	we were going to do we were going to I think arrive in Fes
B	yeah
A	and then travel down the east coast
B	oh
A	I find that that um like the kind of TE Maghrebins in France are just so rude
B	yeah
A	and there's like there's no barriers
B	yeah
A	and just not chat you up even
B	yeah
A	it's disgusting
B	yeah
A	it's weird though
B	it doesn't happen in Spain
B	I mean I got followed once or twice in Spain
A	are you sure his best mate wasn't trying to rob you from behind?
B	um
A	Pick pocket
B	probably
A	it was probably a diversion tactic
B	yeah it probably was
B	different ones
A	oh
B	I thought if they thought I was local they would treat me with a little bit more respect
B	Cos I don't wanna know what you're saying
A	so like lecherous things
B	just nasty
A	just say you can think it but just don't vocalize it
B	just don't even  don't even  look at me
A	oh no
B	and
A	I'm sorry
B	well it was an experience
A	no
B	yeah
A	crikey
B	and my mate was like why don't you just hit them? Or like shout at them? And I was like we're in a Muslim country
B	like the men it's all men
A	mm
B	no one's gonna save you
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	they're all gonna stick up for each other
A	oh well
B	yeah
A	you know
B	so I'm not going back there
B	but apart from that
A	and I saw that you said to
B	I have been to Thailand
A	ah
B	Thailand Cambodia and Vietnam
A	okay
B	I haven't been everywhere
A	you know people everywhere
B	I haven't been everywhere
B	I was like oh maybe one a year is my
B	aim at the moment
A	oh my friend's just been to Burma and it looks amazing
B	amazing
A	she had such a fantastic time
B	yeah
A	and do local things
B	things
A	as opposed to touristy stuff
B	how did she do that? Cos I always wonder
A	I think she's just got such a that
A	kind of personality
B	that's pretty awesome
A	takes risks in chatting with people
B	yeah yeah
A	and because she's so eager and she's very I dunno she's very um engaging
B	yes
A	I think she picks her  she picks her  victims well
B	charming
A	but yeah she was chatting she she travelled with a another girl who she met in a a backpacking place
B	yeah
A	en en route
B	yeah
A	to maybe
B	to sort of
A	chat with people
B	nice
A	had a few whispered political discussions and
B	blimey
A	went and stayed at er temples and stuff like that
B	my mum's one of those
B	I mean a long time ago they came to visit me in Japan
B	and every day they had some story of how
B	they'd had a tour in a police van
B	someone had driven them home
B	but you're just like working your way round the countryside
A	that's good
B	yeah
A	whenever my parents used to come to visit me I felt I just felt that they they abandoned all abilities to make any decisions at the airport
B	oh and
A	yes
B	oh
A	I mean I can
B	oh I just leave my parents to it
A	I can understand
B	is this in Spain?
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	when I was in living in France as well
B	yeah
B	they come visit you and they're just like you're gonna look after me right? And I'm like um my language skills are just as bad as yours
B	Don't be deceived by the fact that I've been living here for three months
B	to go new place? Or to go? New I really wanna go to China
A	cool
B	I'm sort of hoping that it might happen
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	because I want to buy the ticket in Japan
A	mm
B	so I'm not sure if it's even possible
A	that's a shame
B	it is
A	er go to Taiwan instead
B	yeah
A	right
B	I dunno about Taiwan
A	I don't know
B	before?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	aha
B	it would be from May to June
A	how many weeks have you got to do your dissertation?
B	I've got from May to
A	mm
B	so I'm hoping that I'll be pretty much done by the end of July
A	mm
B	yeah
B	I just wanna get through this
A	mm
B	but here it's quite a small department
A	mm
B	like if you don't know what to do
A	what what are other your fellow students doing?
B	most people are not doing teaching related projects
A	oh okay
B	because there's actually only five applied linguistics people
A	mm
B	like how does this affect a classroom? Or I dunno
A	what kind of TEFL stuff did you cover?
B	I did teacher training
A	oh yeah
B	um
A	and did they actually provide modules lectures and stuff on those subjects?
B	yes
A	oh right
B	but that's part of the TEFL course that I kind of
A	okay
B	transferred over to a little bit
A	mm
B	but the other stuff I've done is corpus linguistics
A	aha
B	discourse yeah
A	okay
B	and yeah kind of
A	have you had to cover like structural linguistics and stuff like that?
B	we had a choice
A	oh
B	we all did do a bit of functional grammar
A	urgh
B	urgh
B	because I would've failed the grammar
A	right
B	I think like cos we spent three lessons three ninety minute lessons analyzing one sentence
A	oh my Lord
B	so most of us were not really prepared to go in and do a full analysis by ourself
A	how long are papers?
B	four thousand words
A	huh
B	our dissertation's only twelve thousand
A	mm
B	it's not
A	especially
B	problem with TE wittering
A	especially for a research project
B	yeah
A	as well
B	we have one research paper this term
A	so how many have there been in total? Apart from the dissertation
B	not that many you know
B	I've done three already
A	still quite heavy going
B	it's
A	especially when you have to read so much
B	I know
A	before you
B	mm
A	I had to always force myself into starting to write things
B	because you were still reading and taking notes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	aw
B	so I'm just like it's not interesting
A	mm
B	like you have to be interested otherwise
A	yeah
B	well you don't have to be interested
A	and it what what do you think the masters level is like? Cos I was you know the course I was doing was er um at a masters level
B	mhm
A	er had written
B	yeah
A	um
B	but did they do well?
A	well they passed
B	they passed?
A	they passed a masters level assignment
B	I think passing well I don't know to be honest because I proofread
A	mm
B	and content wise she didn't have a clear understanding of what she was doing
A	right
B	so I did understand why
A	mm
B	but I think I mean you know I don't know many people that are getting firsts to be honest
A	well I got
B	it seems fairly
A	I got two distinctions
B	oo
A	and I was just absolutely floored cos it's
B	why? You've so much experience you're
A	because it just
B	bringing to the table
A	yeah but it just felt like it was the
B	mm
A	whereas I was thinking oo masters level research it's going to be really heavy and
B	yeah
A	it's gonna be statistical analysis
B	no I don't think it is that bad
A	and lots of different variables
B	common sense
A	Mickey Mouse
B	how many papers have you already submitted?
A	three
B	okay
A	no there is no dissertation
B	there's no dissertation?
A	Cos it's it's so practical based
B	and how long are the papers?
A	three thousand words
B	okay
A	which is a nightmare because it's so difficult
B	so keeping it short and concise
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	yep
A	it was difficult
B	mm
A	and then describe the research methods
B	that's a lot
A	and then TE analyse the research methods and TE analyse how if they worked
B	no
A	see I'm getting confused just telling you about it
B	well the I mean if it if you have to do that much it's literally what? A paragraph for each thing?
A	more or less
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	was more or less two sides
B	sides
A	and then the evaluation and of your findings and criticizing your research methods was about two sides
B	Mickey Mouse?
A	Mickey Mouse
A	but I guess you don't find that
B	I'm finding well I mean I don't I I didn't know at the beginning what a good level was
A	all As
B	and then after that I didn't do so well
A	mm
B	like it's er the the things last term cos it was all new
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	in fact I might show you one of my papers in a bit
A	yeah
B	what do you think of this rubbish
B	oh
A	it sounds so difficult having to choose your dissertation topic with no hardly any support though
B	but I guess that's the way it is
A	so what's your driving instructor like?
B	I thought no more complaining
B	he's alright
A	why?
B	but apart from that
A	really chilled
B	mine has a lisp
B	which is not helpful
A	oh no
B	but I mean I like him
A	three
B	oh you're ever?
A	yeah in my life
B	oh okay
A	this is my third one
B	blimey
A	yeah
B	do you get worked up before the lessons?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	he told me that I was gonna be driving on the
B	already?
A	crikey
B	and it was alright?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	and you know I've got problems with my neck?
B	yeah
A	well oh the day after I was like
B	ff
A	like today we're gonna do emergency stops
B	already?
A	no I can't do it
B	already?
A	mm
B	that's really quick
A	he pushes me quite quickly
B	okay
A	well I was thinking if you're getting er you're travelling over to your parents to have this
B	yeah
A	well why don't you just catch the number one bus
B	Don't they normally pick you up from most places though?
A	no
B	the thing is that I'm I've been driving around the test centre roads near my parents' house
A	I don't understand
B	um so um different test centres have different pass rates
A	ah
B	so I wanna stay in that area
A	ah
B	so I've had like sixteen lessons
A	oh
B	probably about ten lessons away from taking my test I'd say
A	ah
B	I haven't done many manoeuvres
A	gosh
B	I didn't do that until like my tenth lesson or so
A	what were you doing for your first three or four lessons?
B	driving driving driving
A	yeah
B	oh I'm only there now
A	oh okay
B	but it's taken a long time
A	and how much do you pay per lessons?
B	ninety-two quid for five lessons
A	so that's eighteen quid an hour
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oo
B	I've passed my theory
A	oh have you?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	but I'm taking a big long break now
A	mm
B	I'm gonna have to come back and sort of get back onto it
A	when how do you do the theory then? Do you just apply to do it?
B	you just apply online and pay online
A	uh-huh
B	near Argos
A	uh-huh
B	and you just go in and do it
A	really?
B	yeah
A	but did had you learnt a lot from the driving that you'd done?
B	no
A	oh okay
B	it depends on what you get
A	what kind of questions came up?
B	the usual
B	just for example if so you're watching a video and your car's travelling down a road and you're looking out for people stepping onto the road or something that might
A	mm
B	like someone who's walking along the pavement might suddenly step onto the road
A	okay
B	so I'm just like click click
B	click click
B	click click click click like
A	oh okay
B	so make sure you do it twice at least when you see the hazard
A	oh no
B	doing it once
A	didn't the theory test used to be just a few questions asked by the
B	you still have some questions asked by the
A	really?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	like you have to lift up the bonnet and say what's what
A	no
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	oh my life
B	nothing major
A	mm
B	I mean cos they say like on average you take as many lessons as your age
B	and I'm just like uh
A	I've never heard that one
B	God
B	I would say
A	yeah
B	I neither am I
A	yeah
B	so
A	how old are you?
B	twenty-eight
A	how many lessons have you had?
B	seventeen
A	oh well eleven more
B	I think I'll need a few more to be honest
B	doing it
A	yeah
B	wow
A	and it's always been such a huge thing er when I wake up I'm like oh my  oh my  gosh I was driving in my sleep
B	how quickly do you wanna do it?
A	um I've
B	not bothered
A	I'm er not rushed
B	yeah yeah
A	I'd prefer to live in a nice little city that's got good public transport
B	me too
A	but I just thought it would it's a good idea to
B	it's good to have it
A	take advantage of this time
B	yeah
A	also if there's any jobs that come up that require
B	that you need to drive
A	a driving licence
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and it's just such a shame when you're like okay we can't help anyone
A	yeah
B	and it would just be useful to to be able to hire a car sometimes to sort something out
A	yeah
B	and so
B	he seems to think he can do it in a month
B	and in Japan they don't let you practise on the road
A	right
B	they practise in a little grid area in the back of a test centre
A	actually do you know what? I think I'd prefer to do that for the first
B	for the first one or two
A	first few lessons
B	yeah
A	not I mean tut not bonnet and explain what's going on but what you have to do in order to change gear
B	without worrying about the road
A	oh there's someone following me
B	yes
B	instead of swearing when I'm driving I always just go eek eek
B	and he's just like stop it  stop it
A	and then I said oh excuse my French
A	there used to never
B	heard it all
A	be a sentence without a swear word
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I don't wanna just drive it into a wall
A	uh-huh
B	so I mean I drove it fine
B	because like the clutch and everything is so different on a different car
A	really?
B	and it was I was just like couldn't
B	you're very safe and slow just like your mother
B	and my driving instructor got all defensive for me
A	aw
B	twelve in the middle like
A	aw
B	yeah
A	just shouted at you all the time
B	not all the time
B	yeah
A	I mean I'd just jump if he shouted at me
B	I cried once in the car
A	really?
B	after that
A	why? What happened?
B	he just was yelling
A	no
B	and then he was like pull over
A	oh no
B	and he sort of stopped a little bit after that
A	that's the whole thing about learner drivers
B	I know
A	like yeah
B	I know
A	mm
B	but it seems really hard to find someone good
A	well why don't you just have like a few lessons with my  with my  instructor? Cos honestly he's so he puts you at your ease
B	but it's just the whole
A	I can't believe I'm confident
B	I don't I really don't wanna take my test somewhere else
A	but you won't wouldn't have to
B	but you have to have that driver's car
A	yes
B	and that instructor
A	but you could go back  you could go back  to your instructor
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it might be  it might be  a good thing just to have experience with someone else in the car
B	that's true actually
A	yeah
B	stuff like that
A	for eight pounds and stuff and I'm thinking mm do I want to go with a driving instructor who is working as part of a franchise and probably gets paid
B	yeah
A	ten P an hour?
B	yeah
A	is he gonna be happy in his job? No
B	that's true
A	I'd prefer to go with the guy who's got his own business and he's relaxed and
B	yeah
A	really?
B	yeah
B	until they pass the damn thing
A	you will pass your test
A	you will bring shame onto our driving school if you don't
B	it seems like that
A	gosh
B	yeah
A	and just out of interest how much extra did it cost your parents to put you on their?
B	three hundred
A	three hundred quid?
B	for a year
A	pff
B	for a brand new Fiesta
A	right
B	it's not that bad
A	yeah
B	it sounds a lot
A	really?
B	when I tell them
A	you see tut
B	that sounds like a huge amount of money though
A	that's like a bus pass for the whole year
B	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	like I had all these lessons and then I got I went in the car in the new car with my dad and the driving instructor last week and I was er literally shaking
A	mm
B	and my driving instructor was just like what's wrong with you?
B	you're not normally like this
A	aw
B	but they're not really my it was supposed to be for my mum the car
A	mm
B	so I'm just like well should've somebody should really drive this car like
A	did your dad choose it? Or did your mum choose it?
B	my dad chose it
A	why didn't he let your mum choose it? Cos surely
B	Cos he's a numpty
B	wonder how often that'll come up in a corpus search
A	he's a numpty
A	hm
B	that's fine
A	ah
B	that's not clever at all
A	oh no
B	I know
B	it's like hello I'm here
A	yeah
B	basically
A	all the time
B	but in a way it's good because I used to never be able to find them in a parking lot because they have a silver car and there's so many silver cars
B	and now it's just like there they are
B	like I can see them a mile away
A	what kind of car is it?
B	it's a Fiesta
A	mhm
B	so the dashboard comes really far down in front of you
B	it is basically
A	so what what can you command it to do by voice?
B	so it's all auto
B	er you can make it you can put it onto auto like cruise er through voice activation
A	no wonder  no wonder  the dashboard comes up to your face
B	I know
A	it's it needs a brain
B	it's like a rocket
A	and have you tried night driving?
B	um
A	is that a lot different from driving during the day?
B	it's not that bad actually
A	really?
B	um
A	Cos I don't know whether my eyes are sensitive to light but you know those um headlights
B	mm
A	that are really kind of like
B	bright
A	bright blue
B	oh
A	white? They they leave such a trace on my vision
B	mm
A	that er but but it doesn't seem to be so intense for other people
B	have you ever had it checked?
A	yeah
B	are there special things glasses you can wear for that?
A	yeah I'll just look really cool all the time
B	yeah
A	with my sunglasses and
B	with my shades in the night
B	that's proper Knight Rider
A	yeah
A	I dunno
A	I'd like to end up in a little city and be able to walk to work or catch a bus
B	you wanna stay in the UK?
A	if it's cold
B	so er
A	but
B	yeah
A	and a stable income
B	but when you say I want to end up does that mean that could be anywhere? You're open to ending up anywhere? Or are you
A	I'm open to ending up anywhere as long as there's a way of er supporting myself
B	stability
A	and financial independence
B	stable job
A	Cos that was the worst thing about Spain
B	how much you were gonna earn
A	going yeah well you never knew how much you were gonna get earn month to month
B	yeah
A	just because they wanted to save a bit of money
B	mm
A	and so that means no
A	healthcare
B	yeah
A	no
B	I understand
A	unemployment benefit in case you lose your job
B	that's what I was like in Japan
B	and um recently they contacted me and said Oh we've got full-time jobs and I worked for them for quite a long time hoping and praying that the day would come that they would say we have full-time jobs
A	yeah
B	and suddenly they came up with four full-time jobs
A	in Japan?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	but then I looked at the conditions and I was like nah
A	mm
B	and I had more flexibility
A	mm
B	flexible
A	being flexible
B	mm
A	but living with the restrictions of not knowing when you're gonna have holiday
B	yeah
A	if the fridge breaks down
B	yeah
A	oh
B	the
A	mm
B	it was even my boyfriend's job was not a hundred percent stable
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	it would be great to be able to earn full earn part-time wages and be able to live off them
B	I think in Spain that's very hard
A	oh it's impossible
B	in Japan
A	is just horrendous
B	I used to make for one lesson er so I worked for a little I worked for British Council and I worked for a little college
A	mhm
B	and they would term employ you per term
A	okay
B	on them
A	yep
B	so they had a maximum of eight classes
A	and how much was your rent?
B	my rent between two thirty thousand each
A	uh-huh
B	it's about coming up to two thousand eight hundred a month
A	mhm
B	which is as much as most people make full-time
A	mm
B	sometimes
A	right
B	but a hundred thousand a month will quite happily clothe feed party whatever you wanna do
B	it's quite a decent amount of money
A	yeah
B	you need to go home or something breaks down then yeah it's a problem
A	mm
B	but yeah
A	but it just seems here even um the one of the newly qualified teachers at my er at the school I was in before December she was struggling on a teaching salary
B	what is the lowest? Eighteen?
A	twenty-two eight hundred?
B	I think the cost of living in the UK is extortionate
A	it has gone up so much
B	yeah
A	but it's the same in Spain
B	yeah
A	but here it's yeah the fuel bills supermarket bills
B	just things like council tax and stuff
A	mm
B	is so expensive
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	really?
B	everything else is
B	I always feel like I spend a fortune here on food
A	you're supposed to eat it
B	yeah
A	filled
B	yeah
A	with fruit and vegetable for pff ten Euros
B	ten quid
A	that would last you more than a week
B	not here
A	well I can't believe it
B	it's really expensive
A	it is
B	if you wanna eat well it's really expensive
A	stupid
B	there are not many jobs that pay thirty
A	I know
B	I don't know if I even wanna live in this country to be honest
A	no
B	yeah
A	and there is an a possibility of doing that here so
B	here
A	but obviously cos you
B	you wanna stay in Europe?
A	um
B	would you ever look further afield?
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	and knowing what tut knowing how much effort it takes
B	yeah
A	a new language and to a new way of doing things
B	just exhausted by the whole thing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's comforting in a way being back in the country where you know I speak the language
B	everything
A	yeah
B	there is no limitation
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	but no I wouldn't um rule out living in another country
B	mm
A	putting down roots and and if you can't do that
B	yeah
A	to support yourself
A	I don't wanna earn too much money
B	just wanna be comfortable without worrying about money
A	definitely
B	yeah
A	person's salary
B	that's true
A	unless you're earning over thirty grand
B	I just think the housing crisis is disgusting here
A	yeah
B	like I mean pff it's so expensive
A	yeah
B	I was in
A	oh yeah
B	the the family that I the
A	mhm
B	and I was just curious
A	oh
B	and I'm like they're not they're nice
A	yeah
B	and it's far away
A	but it's
B	from the city centre
A	but it's also
B	I know
A	yeah
B	but that's just insanely expensive
A	it is  it is
B	A one bedroom flat for two hundred and seventy-five
A	crazy
B	is so
A	enormous
B	different
A	I mean they're looking at um two bedroomed house
B	oh okay
A	one hundred and seventy
B	there's a big difference then
A	really big difference
B	but I mean er we were looking at buying um before we rented we recently moved to a new flat in Tokyo
A	yeah
B	and that's not bad
A	especially when salaries sound to be better
B	yeah they are a bit better
A	so where why do you say that you don't know if you wanna live in Japan? Cos I
B	no I mean I like it
A	is that in light of what happened last year with the earthquake? And the nuclear?
B	it's a little bit about that
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	I want like I the thing that fills me with terror which is me getting way ahead of myself of course but I don't wanna have a child and be away from my mum
A	mm
B	and not only be away but be an ocean
B	a thirteen-hour plane ride away
A	exactly
B	it's really far
A	mhm
B	so I just  I just  want a support network as I get older
A	yeah
B	and as they get older
A	yep
B	yeah
A	especially with all the injuries I had
B	mm
A	all of a sudden you've you can't
B	yeah
A	rely on your body or something
B	yeah yeah
A	mhm
B	just to improve my spoken
A	yeah
B	because that is not something you can make up
A	yep
B	get to a point where you can sort of get by
A	yeah
B	so that's a huge thing is feeling like I live on a periphery of a society
A	yeah
B	it's temporary
A	it does leave you feeling slightly marginalized doesn't it
B	and yeah er I'm not the brightest when it comes to languages
B	especially Japanese
A	such a difficult language though
B	school's expensive too
A	oo ff
B	that's like three four
A	mm
B	but it was just so expensive
A	yeah
B	it's fun but it's exhausting
A	yeah
B	students
A	either
B	no
A	I hate
B	learning that on this degree
A	yeah
B	but actually studying
A	but actually
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	and it was just like I couldn't get them into my head
A	mm
B	and it was just you know it was really hard
B	like that would be not good
