C	what is wing liner? I want to know
A	you don't know what wing liner is?
C	what?
A	it's when you have wings on your eyeliner

A	no
C	what is that?
A	no it's winged eyeliner
C	oh right I do that
A	yeah you do that's why I was like how do you not know what wing liner is?
C	wing liner
A	when every time you do it now you just go like wing liner
A	that looks like a couple
C	you were filming with your friend
A	yeah
C	and like she was like she said it behind the camera she like you suit wing liner and then you just went wing liner and I just thought it was like so you like the personality coming out for your video which was really nice
A	thanks man yeah I know cos I hate basically
C	what do you mean?
A	like she's really shy and like she doesn't I can't explain it but she's just not that person and I don't like that because it's like that's not who you are like that's not funny
C	mm
A	do you I don't know it's just not her and like on her channel we did this one where it was what's it called erm
B	yeah I remember that
A	and in real life she didn't actually take off most of her makeup so she still had like mascara and stuff
C	yeah
A	and I completely took off my makeup like you could see spots I'm not saying like if you're insecure like that's fine but then everyone in then everyone in the comments was like oh my god you look exactly the same with and without makeup and I was like that's cos she's wearing makeup but I'm not going to say it cos then you look like a bitch
C	yeah yeah you should create another account and like yeah
E	yeah
A	they'll be like who was the other person in the room though?
A	but I don't know she's just very different how she is in real life and she's like sometimes she's a bit odd like when she just ran it was really nice but when she'd just bought you a birthday present she'd never met you
B	she'd never met me and she bought me Topshop leggings socks and something else
C	yeah but did she have a lot of money? I heard that one of you say that before
A	yeah but
C	how do you feel about the patterned wallpaper by the way?

E	well it had to be because
C	hello guys
E	there was only three of us there so girls but I can't remember what it was anyway it was something inappropriate but I was so drunk I just can't remember but he oh no he wasn't going to fight that was it he was just saying something like can you just stop like that's not appropriate or something and you know what other guys can be like
C	yeah aggressive and
E	and he was literally like erm he was like come on then let's fight and stuff and me and
C	yeah

B	me?
C	yeah
B	yeah erm well
E	who? did I pay?

A	but yeah I don't I just still don't understand why
B	no he's such a
C	has he even talked to anyone?
B	I told him that I didn't
A	he's really odd or he's nice but then he acts really different in different situations like there he just didn't really speak whereas other times I've met him he's so overly chatty it's creepy
B	yeah
A	and then other situations he's just weird like or he's just nice so like I can never figure him out I'm like I really don't know who you are do you know what I mean?
B	the thing is I don't I don't know what
A	she
A	and she said yes
B	and she say yeah yeah that's fine and the exact same thing
E	because
B	she does that a lot
A	she did it when I went back to
B	mm
A	I saw it over her shoulder and I was like I was thinking what are you doing?
B	yeah
C	she did what? what did she do?
A	she was like come and take her she really wants to go with you and stuff I had not said anything
B	no
A	I actually was really tired and I wanted to just sit on the back and then she was like well you have to go now because like he really wants you to come and I I was like
B	that's not that's not technically true because we did me and
A	no no no not you no no no no not you I don't mean that but she shouldn't have
B	oh instigated it yeah
A	because then she told me he instigated it
C	yeah
A	so
C	yeah I know what you mean she shouldn't be saying that it was his idea all night
A	mm that's what annoyed me and she did it a few times when I was at hers
A	yeah and that's why
B	like once when I'd invited her to stay over and she was like yeah yeah I definitely will and then
A	you you looked I would have yeah
B	I looked on her phone and I saw the message and nothing from
E	yeah she does that
B	so then I exited it and I put put the phone back in there and went down to meet them and I acted all fine and stuff and then when I came back up to the house to say goodbye when
E	no you're not
B	but I wasn't just going to stand there and be like actually I
E	and as well yeah
C	at least you know though
B	yeah
E	and as well sometimes you just I always think like I'll just let it slide it's easier because it's just pathetic
