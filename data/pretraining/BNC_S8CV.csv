A	it's the one she did in the car yesterday to make sure they work
B	they do
C	yeah I think they did
A	but we didn't test it
C	what? it's not you don't
C	the ones that the ones that I've sent across to
D	you could still hear it
C	you could still hear it yeah but the ones in the car I've sent to my email and they've not come through yet and I've done it like four times so
D	they're not sitting comfy on my face these
B	leave them off till we get
D	it's just uncomfortable squinting
C	did you see that Motovun film festival?
D	mm it's in July
C	air con
B	we shouldn't have the window open for that
C	air con works better though
B	I don't like it though it's but if it's really
C	oh dad you wanna just go nip into this shop to get some matches or a lighter?
A	no get some in Porec mate don't worry
B	do you want me to close this? is that what you want?
D	well
B	well
D	either well I was just gonna say we should either have windows down or air con cos there's no point in both
B	you're getting up into the town
D	yeah
B	it's like that
D	mm
C	I was reading in the bulletin in the news apparently some bloke was flying his helicopter and then a seagull crashed through the foot of his erm you know windscreen
B	yeah
C	and erm apparently like it said it died on impact but he said that he had it said that like the bloke had to put his foot over it to stop like flapping about and making him
B	well what dead?
D	the
C	the seagull
B	yeah
C	and he and it said like he he stuck his foot on its head basically to stop it flying around but so it said the die the bird died on impact but if it
B	no
D	where was that?
C	in
D	didn't know there were many
C	well it might it might have been in the
D	didn't know there were many people with helicopters around
C	it might have been in the
B	that could be dangerous a
C	no I don't think it would make a big difference
D	do you know it would?
D	that's why they have airports
C	really? no but
D	yeah that's why at airports they have cars that drive around with like loud whizzers on them to drive away birds
C	oh right
D	the runways
C	see I thought yeah but if a propeller it it goes so fast it'd just chop it up do you not think?
D	well you would think so but it it
A	there have been cases yeah
D	the birds have got into propellers and the plane's crashed
A	but they can actually destroy jet engines believe it or not cos there's hundreds of fans in the middle er on the inside of a jet propulsion engine spinning around incredibly fast
C	it must be a lot of force to get a like thousand is it? or normally tonnes it's probably a couple of
A	yeah
C	baggage and all the people
B	is that the railway line there?
D	I'm not sure
B	the sign
D	it's not a proper railway
B	no

C	I was gonna say
D	oh right
C	but that's a boring word
D	well he's on
A	what to
D	no to Porec
B	I think I'd rather
D	mm
D	it was quieter later in the day wasn't it?
A	might be a bar up there
B	when we arrived that was what? five-ish?
D	yeah but there were less cars than there were there then I think
B	well
D	can you sit your driving theory when you're still sixteen? not sure or do you have to be seventeen?
A	think you'd have to be seventeen
C	yeah I guess so
A	that's not a bad idea do that through your summer through your your Christmas holidays mate
C	yeah but I'll have mocks straight after Christmas
A	have you?
C	yeah
D	yeah I have no idea how it works now
B	are we recording now?
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	oh the sunshine
D	it said
C	I mean I was thinking
D	I think he's got two but he's not gonna get he doesn't need any more for the next two years cos he's gonna be studying for the next two years and he gets it after that
C	oh I thought it was only a one-year course
D	no two
C	oh
B	I was saying this to
C	I could have sworn he said it was one year
D	it's one year to do his LPC and then another year do his GDL
C	sorry so the
D	the first year is the like law conversion
C	yeah
D	the second year's is the graduate diploma in law which qualifies you to practice
C	right crikey that's a lot of education isn't it?
A	but he's getting a salary this year isn't he
D	no
A	oh right
D	they give him a living allowance but he doesn't start getting a salary until the third year when he's actually working for them
C	so he's gonna be like mid-twenties isn't he like by?
D	he's like he'll be twenty-three this year
C	amazing
B	watch out for the deer
C	yeah let's not have a deer through the front windscreen please
B	do they make cars in Croatia
A	I don't believe so
C	would have thought so yeah but it's got kilometres an hour instead of miles per hour so they must make erm
D	yeah but Croatia's
C	yeah I
A	no I don't believe so
B	most countries are kilometres per hour aren't they?
C	really?
B	we're the
C	the correct way
D	pardon?
C	the correct way
B	I remember when I was ten or eleven at school them saying we'd changed from imperial to metric there wouldn't be any more miles or pounds or ounces
D	what that's what they predicted?
B	yeah
C	well we've not got pounds and ounces any more have we? we've got grams and kilograms
D	of course we have we have both really
A	do you work in grams
B	you work in pounds and ounces and I work in grams
C	yeah absolutely I work in grams and kilograms yeah
A	yeah yeah
D	I'd far better know what a kilogram is than an ounce
C	where? oh here? don't know
B	think that's where the police were before?
C	yeah
D	it was yeah
C	what's it's no were gonna say it's a car park but it can't be
A	can I go on the
D	how we gonna get there then?
C	can't get across there
B	sure you can
C	yeah you can
D	I didn't see a sign there for a
C	it did say Pula
D	yeah we're not going to Pula
C	are we not?
C	Mirna I wonder if that's river
D	no it's the name of the river
C	oh okay
A	how many days is it till the EU vote?
D	Thursday
A	oh right
C	so you know your postal votes?
D	yeah
C	will they are they like counted now or are they counted like along with?
B	I think they count them now
C	so realistically you can have an inclination of what the populace is
B	mm
D	no well not really cos it's a very small number of people do postal votes
C	I can't really remember how it all started to be honest with you it's a bit like
D	what do you mean?
C	like the whole EU referendum thing I
D	it was it was the Tory's campaign
B	it's the
D	it was the Tory's whole election campaign
C	see I can't even remember
D	no that they would offer a vote
C	I can't remember
D	essentially they said they thought we that we should go out except now they've backtracked and said we should stay in cos we've got this amazing deal that David Cameron's negotiated
C	well think about it
D	I'm like being sarcastic
C	I know I get that
D	so I'm saying it's hypocritical because they they were saying we'll offer a vote and give people a chance to say that no that we're that we didn't have a good deal and then
C	yeah I get that but then
D	he's he's he didn't negotiate very much at all
C	I don't even know
D	did he dad?
A	erm
D	I don't actually know the exact
B	the only thing I've heard is people coming here can't claim benefits for four years till they've worked here for four years
C	which is fair enough to be fair
D	all I heard that was that that there would be no pressure for us to join the euro or anything like that but what did you mean dad?
A	I can't remember it wasn't too much to be honest with you
D	nothing interesting
A	no
C	I watched a really interesting thing it was like a you know like a BBC
B	see that's that's the that's the entire point
D	that's the concern
A	ignoring the politics and ignoring the fact that it's good for the economy being in the in the EU and just concentrating on a single
D	the
A	stupid
D	yeah people are looking at it from one
A	issue
D	perspective
C	yeah granted but it's not really good for the economy is it dad? because how much do we pay into the EU weekly? it's like lots and lots of money that could be used elsewhere
A	well
C	hospitals
A	we shall we'll if we vote out we'll spend the next ten years renegotiating trade deals and losing trade left right and centre and the economy will go downhill
B	no you've got you've no evidence for that
A	well I have
B	just
A	okay why?
B	listened to the rhetoric
A	well I know that we'll
C	if right
A	have to renegotiate all the trade deals so that is fact
D	well not all our trade deals are trade deals with Europe
A	no
C	but people
A	our trade deals with the rest of the world as well
C	yeah people
A	cos all the trade deals with the rest of the world are based on our on our trade deal with Europe we have to go and renegotiate every trade deal throughout the world which will take years of negotiating and cause enormous upheaval in in business when they should be focusing on selling instead of dealing with that
B	well yeah but that can't be true because otherwise we wouldn't export a thing for ten years
A	well
B	if what you're saying is true
A	it's I'm not saying you can't export a thing for ten years but I'm telling you it it'll
B	well how can we export if we haven't got a trade deal?
C	dad you're snorting but
A	there'll be
C	that's mum's opinion
A	interim because there'll be
C	like
A	interim interim measures but it'll take years of
B	I don't think the fact that it would take
A	people's wasted
B	I don't think the fact that it would take ten years to sort out means that it shouldn't be done I don't think that's a good enough reason
A	well
B	because you could say
A	in the
B	no we're not gonna go to war because it would be five years of blood and you know people dying but you know you know you can't
A	well in those ten years
B	you can't that's not a good enough reason is it?
A	our competitors in Europe will have an unfair advantage against us and will trade win trade against us and we'll lose out massively
B	well it's a bit more than that really
C	I no I I
A	okay well
C	when I start working I'll have to pay thirty percent of my wage but people other people can come in and use my money to have five children and then live off that money that's not fair
A	okay but having the Syrians and the Calais border is absolutely nothing to do with the EU referendum
C	no I'm not saying that
C	I I didn't mention that
C	I didn't mention Calais at all
D	and Syria's not even in the EU is it? so that's got nothing to do with it
A	okay well the
C	dad you you're going off you're going off you're going off now dad
A	well
C	first you were talking about Syrians in Calais which nobody mentioned
A	okay but the issue of immigration will not change dramatically whether we're in or out of Europe
C	it well it will because of free travel
D	well I think it would because if we were out of Europe we wouldn't have to we wouldn't have to adhere to the to the rules of letting people from within the EU in it would still be our decision what we did about Syria and places like that that aren't in the EU
C	absolutely I'm I'm not don't get me wrong I'm fine with taking skilled people on like happily I'd I'd take you know if you've got a diploma in engineering and we've got a shortage of engineers come on in
C	an engineer engineers sorry come on in but I'm not I'm not happy when Bob who's come from Romania with
D	I don't think dad
C	no high school degree and a you know it's
A	well
C	not fair
A	up from Romania without a high school degree is working in the fields that no English
B	they're not
D	it's not true dad
D	not working
B	not working
D	I
C	yeah
D	for so many years before they can take out of it and I don't think that's racist at all I think that's just
C	no it's not
D	common sense isn't it?
C	it's just fair yeah
D	it's fair
B	pregnant women go back to Poland because they do a scan every month they fly back when they're pregnant and have a scan every month as well as the scans here
C	with with with I mean the systems we have in place the NHS is nearly at breaking point the education system is
D	well it
C	in a bad state
D	it's in a bad state cos there's primary schools where look at
B	well there's a group been set up hasn't there next to
D	but still even if a child who knows the basics that teacher's gonna have to spend more time with those children you know getting them to understand and teaching them and then the other children are
C	miss out
D	being left by the wayside but like even if I I I think anybody who hasn't contributed regardless of whether they come from abroad or not in fact you know I don't think
C	I didn't even know I could get Jobseeker's when I was eighteen
D	of course you can
B	but his parents have
D	yeah his parents have but regardless he hasn't I don't think people should turn eighteen
B	well
D	and that be an option to them cos if it wasn't an option
C	they'd have to work
D	people would go and get a job
C	we need
B	I think the the real issue is addressing how politicians in Europe abuse the finances there
D	well that's a whole different area that
C	yeah
B	well yeah but how much money have they saved?
C	yeah but if we get out what's the what's that you know leave them to it
D	I'd be happier voting in if we
B	what did you vote then?
D	I voted in but I'm saying I would be more
C	I know that's that's one of the big sticking point for me I don't like the idea of somebody who's who doesn't live who doesn't live in the country who doesn't really have an idea of what the country's all about deciding our rules that's just not fair
B	that's not even touched on all the displaced refugees
D	what do you mean?
B	well you know they'll er they've taking on like
D	from Syria?
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	I know
D	but
C	that's true yeah
B	and if you reattributed some of the money that's being wasted in Europe you'd have money to put back into a systems that would suppose those people when they came
C	yeah but it boils down to this thing whether somebody's come in to abuse the system or
B	they take forever and a day don't they to decide
D	to decide
B	anything
D	people have been in the country for ten years on asylum
D	the government
C	right
D	the system
C	yeah
D	meanwhile that person can't work because they're an asylum seeker they have no right to work so we're paying for them to be there for ten years whilst we make the decision whether they can stay or not
C	yeah
D	this caravan's a bit of a slow-mo
B	whoa
D	jesus
B	what were you looking at then?
A	the road
B	which one?
C	the one over there
B	we need to decide what we're doing about this car don't we?
D	yeah
B	can we speak to this guy?
D	I've no idea but do you remember?
B	she did give it me
D	she gave it you on a receipt it was on the receipt erm
B	she did I don't know what I've done
A	paperwork's in there
C	sorry?
B	what
A	the paperwork's in there
B	I don't I didn't put it in there
C	there's
A	there is there's all the hire car paperwork got
D	it's a tiny little receipt I saw it on the table in the house
B	did you?
D	the other day
A	the hire car paperwork is in the car somewhere
D	yes but it isn't with the hire car paperwork it's a separate receipt
A	oh is it?
B	dad's saying there might be a form though
A	the contact details for the
D	okay
A	hire care will be won't they?
C	a lot of cars don't seem to be working do they their brake lights?
A	it's
C	where's this green car going?
D	the green car's thinking about overtaking there's too many cars there's about seven cars in front
B	well we're not in a hurry we should just keep our distance and drive
C	he's swerving all over the shop this fella
B	what's this?
C	there're like they're like mini churches aren't they like? I don't know they're not mini churches but you know what I mean?
D	like shrines
C	yeah like
D	at the side of the road
B	what is he? what he said
D	they're little churches
C	yeah I get that but I'm saying are they like a memory of somebody who's died? or
D	no they're religious
C	yeah I get that
B	but it's like it reminds you cos you're supposed to say so many prayers a day aren't you? so you could I I think
C	to remind you to say a prayer?
B	yeah or
D	bloody hell what was it?
B	I don't know
C	oh she tells me she prays for me every night don't she? I I've prayed for you all I've prayed for you all thanks nan cheers for that
D	I know she's not even religious really is she?
C	no
B	she did grow up going to church
D	yeah but so did we
B	but that's cos it was like the social gathering
D	come on person behind the caravan
B	chill out
C	it's not the person behind the caravan it's the caravan
B	what's your problem?
D	it is the person if the person behind the if the person behind the caravan overtook then the person behind behind the caravan could overtake and we could all get on with our lives
C	do you know the red car and the black car does that mean you can't overtake or you can overtake?
D	you can't
B	please don't
D	his brake lights are working
C	wheels are
C	the wheels look really thin on that car
B	it's an old car is it a Fabia?
C	I can't even see
B	I don't know what it is it's called a Skoda Fabia I think
C	something's bouncing around in the bottom of his car and all like
C	oh did he?
D	he did yeah
C	oh
D	you know
B	who's she gone working for?
D	she's working at
B	that's right
D	this green car's desperate to overtake isn't it?
D	I can't imagine it's got the horsepower to do it
C	I know this may sound really really stupid but I was thinking do they call it horse do they call it horsepower because a horse you know the mode of transport used to be a horse and cart? so like the horse the the higher the horsepower the more horses you had so the faster you'd go
D	I think that's where it's come from that
C	see
B	yeah
C	just
B	it's an old English term isn't it?
C	Einstein just eat your heart out
B	in fact I think it came from Shakespeare
A	I doubt if
D	I can't hear a word
B	no no horsepower was though
C	did you know that they found erm marijuana in erm?

B	have they done it nicely?
D	er yeah it's nice yeah they've got rid you know there's nothing traditional about it inside now it's just all tiles and but erm it's been it's been derelict since twenty eleven and all boarded up because it had been run as a marijuana farm they'd been like growing weed there
