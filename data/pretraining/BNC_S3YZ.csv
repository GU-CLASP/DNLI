B	shit
A	she's a shark
C	do you reckon that's how we're going to evolve? I always think when people get these things
B	what do we need another finger for?
C	our diet's changing we need more teeth cos we're damaging the teeth that we've got
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	just like a conveyor belt of teeth
C	shark teeth
B	the thing is  The thing is though it's we're we're preserving them a hell of a lot better than what they used to
C	they're still not meant you're teeth still aren't meant to love till as long as a hundred are they? If people are living
A	and we're
C	yeah
B	mm
A	like ripping meat off bones
B	Don't cos I really really still fancy chicken
A	em
B	or spicy spuds
C	spicy spuds
B	yeah
A	just go to the dentist tomorrow and say look if you don't pull it out I'm going to and I'm going piss blood all over the floor
C	yeah
B	no they couldn't get in there
C	it's really scaring me
B	but I don't know if it's cracked at the back
A	man alive
B	that's me sucking up
A	why? Cos you're scared the tooth is going to fall out?
B	yeah
A	right
B	Cos I'm dribbling a hell of a lot more as well
A	is it because you're not so because of that tooth you're not closing your mouth?
B	pretty much yeah
C	you're not swallowing properly
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos it feels uncomfortable
A	yeah
B	so I'm trying to find the best way forward
A	are you meant to be working tomorrow?
C	did you go to work today?
B	mm hm
A	special trousers  Special trousers
B	no
C	ah
A	ah
C	so what happened?
B	it's just filling in paper
A	Cos you can't go on the shop floor like with your
B	no not really
A	yes
C	Good
A	with security but yeah
C	yeah
B	well yeah it just kind of sets the wrong impression though doesn't it? You know you imagine walking into ASDA the first thing you seeing is a eat up face
A	mm
B	oh he's a thug
C	yeah
B	so that's that's that's got to be sorted out
A	right
B	so easy  So easy to find a thief
A	well the one with the food in their pocket
B	yeah
C	I've been there
B	or the empty rucksack
A	well no because take rucksack to Sainsbury's
B	do you?
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and walk out with them full
A	yeah
B	tut tut
A	yeah cos I'm saving the planet man
B	no?
A	but then I do have
C	I'll tell you what if somebody ever stopped me when I wasn't stealing something I would be fucking pissed off
A	probably because you've got a backpack full of food that you have just pad for it's quite heavy you're trying to get home
C	yeah
B	receipts are the way forward
C	I usually leave mine though
A	yeah I put it in a safe place but then if they stop me and then you've got bags of stuff and you're trying to find your receipt yeah
C	yeah
B	bu then there's other questions that they can ask as well
A	yeah
B	and then they can just search the computer
C	I read half a book last night
A	are you enjoying it?
B	half a book
C	about a hundred and thirty pages of summat
B	what are you reading?
C	just can't put it down
C	it's called Hunger Games
B	what's it about?
C	it's set in the future and basically
B	okay
C	blah blah blah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	do you not want to go and see the film?
C	yeah I do but I need to read it first
A	so you have to make a decision when you're on those little plinths do you run for the forest?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	or do you run and get the weapons? Cos if you try and get the weapons and someone beats you to they're going to blow your head off
B	they're going to actually there and then
A	whereas if you run into the forest
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's a real
B	have you seen it?
A	yeah I saw it in the cinema
B	yeah
A	you
B	and she she starts to play the game a bit like she starts trying to like smile to the cameras and show her face if she's done something good or bad so that it gets people watching so it's
A	Cos then she gets sponsors and she gets little presents and stuff when she's out there
C	yeah
A	oh okay
C	she just found him when he was camouflaged in the river and she saved him
A	that bit in the film oh my god
C	no he's got it out he's made it
A	oh I see
C	he's been taught how to use wood and all that stuff
A	make it from what you've got
C	yeah and because of
A	they gloss over that in the film
C	he already knew how to do it with icing and stiuff so he already had the skill
A	oh I see  I see  Because they do have that bit in the film like there's like two minutes of him like painting his hand like a tree bark and then the bit when they're in the jungle and you can see him all camouflaged it's so expertly done that you think where would he have got this stiff from? It's not really explained like how why what? Don't understand
C	yeah she says that she looks in the book it says she look down and she doesn't even realise it's him and she's like what the
C	so she just rescued him and basically carried him cleaned him up got the pus out of his leg and managed to plop him somewhere in this  really looks like it's manmade so if we get spotted we're fucked but he would have come looking for me so
A	they want to see
B	it gets really good write ups doesn't it?
C	mm
A	mm
C	like you can
A	but quite a page turner
C	yeah
B	how far in the future is it set? Is it like real future future?
C	eh
A	they don't give you any date do they?
C	they gave me a date in the book
A	it's this century isn't it?
C	yeah it's still in twenties
B	so yeah it's not like ridiculously far on then?
C	no
B	yeah done
C	how good would that be for this hair?
A	pretty nice
B	see I I I don't like films that are set too far in the future because they tend to go over the top ridiculously
A	that's hilarious
B	they're
A	are they?
B	yeah
A	ah it's a classic
C	I don't think I've seen it
B	yeah
C	so cult classic
B	but that that was set in twenty twenties or something like that wasn't it?
A	yeah but they made it forty years ago
B	no
A	late seventies wasn't it? Or early eighties
B	early eighties
A	so it's thirty year ago
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	ah yeah
A	hasn't quite worked out
B	yeah
A	hilarious
B	Arnold Schwarzenegger film
C	I want to see it
B	yeah
A	you've got to watch it
C	I think this one's set just enough far in the future so that you can believe it
A	well I think a lot of it it does isn't beyond the realms of possibility
C	no
A	you know our fascination with reality TV
C	yeah I
A	civil war that could happen
C	yeah
B	people were stunned when at the Snoop Dog and Dr Dre concert and Tupac came up on stage
A	right
C	what?
B	this weekend Tupac turned up on stage
A	really? No
B	yeah
A	no
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so someone who looks like him
B	they recreated him
C	you did not explain yourself properly there at all
B	no no
C	but he didn't did he? It was only
B	well no
A	and nobody would have thought it was actual him cos you can tell a hologram
C	yeah
B	apparently not with this
A	going to have to Google that
B	yeah me too
A	I want to see what it looks like
B	it looked amazing
C	I don't think I'd know who he was if he smacked me in the face
B	no?

C	I think I may have a swift word with
A	yeah
C	yeah usually
A	right
C	Cos he hates that so I'm clearly accepting another wedding
A	unless they've got a
C	are pretty high
D	what is it you do
C	I arrange conferences and wedding for a hotel
D	what you work in a hotel?
C	yeah
C	then they just ring up and tell me what they want and then I give them advice and then if they don't like it I negotiate it or say no fuck off this is what it costs
A	mm
C	and then they come in or fly in and arrange stuff and have a look round
D	oh so I've got the idea that you like set the tables and all that
C	oh no we don't have to set the tables
D	with all the confetti round them you know what I mean?
A	mm hm
C	no I tell somebody else how the table is supposed to be set so they they arrange the
A	she's the planner
D	yeah

D	at least you know what you want now on your own wedding day
A	none of that
C	I know
A	just parade around the house in it
C	yeah
A	em
C	that's not an option so it doesn't matter
