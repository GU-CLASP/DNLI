A	so
B	erm I like I like math and I like PE I like science and
A	do you?
B	mm just because it's like erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	erm I was a good all-rounder
B	oh yeah I like English as well
A	I loved art I really loved art actually
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm?
A	I mean sorry I liked geography
B	oh
A	we don't they didn't each photography at school
B	yeah
A	and I think I probably
B	mm
A	I was really I mean I did geology A level which is a weird subject but
B	mm
A	to pick
B	that's good
A	I was kind of lucky actually to be honest looking back I was lucky I was kind of naturally okay at most things at school and I really liked it
B	you know most of the girls? they they hate sports
A	mm
B	like they really hate the like
A	mm
B	right because just cos she said she didn't
B	I know
A	I mean she's
B	they're not really gonna have well it is called physical education and you're not really gonna have as much fitness
A	mm
B	if you don't do PE
A	no
A	oh
B	so like
A	that's not kind of encouraging your kids to
B	mm
A	and yet she that's the basically her job was to teach sports
B	I just don't really know how you could hate sports
A	sorry?
B	I just don't really understand
A	well I think they
B	I can understand on the fitness thing or like it might be really quite challenging like in gymnastics
A	do you want some dinner
B	gymnastics is I think he thought I was just messing or dossing or whatever but I like it was
A	who thought you were messing?
B	erm the teacher
A	oh
B	er gymnastics guy
A	mm
B	and he comes in and kind of like puts you in the position and I had to kind of like push myself back up cos it was like
A	mm
B	otherwise it was gonna really hurt from
A	he doesn't sound like the best teacher ever to be honest
B	I don't think he realises how erm like like he's he's
A	I know
B	probably his whole life
A	I know some people are good at just like their sport but they're not good teachers are they?
B	yeah
C	cookie
A	okay
B	mm
A	I just think it's I think they're a bit strange sometimes
B	I do loads of sport
A	no I'm just no I'm not saying you I'm saying one like anyone
B	oh right
A	I'm just saying in the teenage years
B	mm
A	if you're somebody who's never done anything and then doesn't do anything later
B	right
A	mm
B	free free rugby and things
A	yeah
B	and that's like really good for you
A	yeah
B	and it's
B	yeah
A	not free generally but
B	yeah but it's like free for me if you know what I mean
A	mm
B	and like
A	I know what you mean
B	thank thank you
B	yeah
A	well it's part of my job to be able to like give you these opportunities as well I know it's not always easy but so some things are just you know I don't think it's okay to sort of like oh just wait until you're eighteen and then you can do some sports it's too late then isn't it?
B	mm
A	you kind of have to do it now I have to find money from somewhere just do it it's erm it's a priority really
B	like I really enjoy rugby and gymnastics
A	yeah and they're
B	thank you
A	I mean at the end of the year you might want to review and see like do I still carry on with the gymnastics? do I still carry on with the rugby? it's er I think if you give things at least a year you usually even though rugby is it is quite rough isn't it?
B	I know I mean er well well
A	you're like you're covered in bruises
B	well
A	I know it's just you're not like a huge big lad either or with like a great bit skull on your head
B	which is
A	do you know what I mean?
B	you know that's good
A	is it? but
B	yeah because backs they're not like I mean they get tackled but not like the forwards do
A	is that
B	er he was a forward but now they've put him into the back for no apparent reason
A	oh
B	he's just a back really
A	you're not gonna get put forward ever are you?
B	no
A	I think if you get put forward I might have to just say stop
B	there's one guy smaller than me on forward but he chose to go on forward like he really wanted to be on forward
A	yeah
B	if you every heard of like a spear tackle? it's when you get
A	er do I really wanna know
B	no not really
A	I don't think I er wanna know
B	okay
A	yeah
B	being a back
A	still a bit rough though
B	yeah
A	oh are you gonna cover me? I'm gonna just get do you want to sit up here? sit on the chair love you're eating
B	to be honest most of the bruises
B	are from my teammates
A	yeah
B	that's how I do it
A	why are they all on your legs?
B	because when you when you get when you have the ball then when you get tackled that doesn't give you anybody
A	any room maybe a small little
A	yeah
B	when you're on the ground
B	people have to go and step over you and steal the ball
C	Chewbacca
B	and mum there's two people above you
C	bacca
B	Chewbacca then there's two there's two people above you
C	two
B	yeah there's
C	two
A	two people above you and
C	two
B	the the ball and they're fighting over the ball on top of you so it's like
A	that kind of went over my head but
B	a ruck
A	to be honest as long like your head isn't getting bashed in like your leg can
B	no
A	can get bashed in and that's not so bad
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah and do
B	I know
B	and then do know
B	five more of everything
C	shoes
B	shoes
B	like we do the really hard thing and he was like yeah he goes right fifteen push-ups and we did fifteen push-ups fifteen push-ups right now back and then do fifty oh fifty like arm legs or whatever they're called
A	mm
B	it's so hard I
B	I have to do twenty of them and then I have to do twenty-five or
A	yeah okay one word of advice can you cos you're quite good at putting your whole enthusiasm in just don't do it so like fervently keep some of your energy back cos if he's asking you to do loads and loads just like if you're doing press-ups don't do it with your full kind of strength just do it with a bit of it
