C	well I
B	that I really need to eat up and I feel too bad
C	I
B	too bad not to eat it
C	I'm not doing strictly five hundred calories or six hundred but
B	mm
C	but it erm I'm doing
A	how many did you do at the beginning? you know the
C	I kept er fairly well
A	er five hundred
C	six hundred actually because they the thing they
A	oh
C	they gave
A	I just I just wondered
C	five hundred for women and six hundred for men
A	oh right
C	as well so the original
A	mm
B	yeah
C	thing was but erm
B	I wonder if it really does
C	and I said it worked very well
B	well it did
A	well yeah I remember
C	mm
A	mm
C	I shed a lot of weight but now
B	which is still you know a lot less than normal isn't it?
C	yeah er
A	that's it and it's it's been it's thinking about it it's
B	mm
C	but
A	you know
C	the problem is I have when I've done it in the past quite successfully I have then just gone away and put on weight and that
B	right
C	is what I'm
B	trying not to kind of
C	and I weigh myself regularly at the gym and erm
A	and you weigh
C	uhu
B	yeah
A	then erm I think that again you can just you can you can you can you can see what's happening
B	yeah
C	uhu
A	mm erm
B	I know I got a weighing machine a while ago just cos it's it's quite good just to keep it on
A	mm
B	like for me like after you've been pregnant and that kind of thing it can it can just really go you know your body doesn't really remember what it was or anything
B	so it can if you can back a
C	yeah
B	and just even
B	just knowing is quite useful
A	mm mm erm do you still go the gym then
C	mm yeah the a bit less
B	yeah
C	mm and
B	what do you do there? do you do the?
C	I'm getting cramp in my legs
B	mm
C	at night and that sort of thing and so I don't go so often
B	no yeah
C	and I don't work as hard as I did
B	yeah
C	erm what do I do?
B	yeah
C	and then I do the round of the weight machines
B	yeah

A	they get erm delivered to their house
B	yeah
A	six meals
B	six meals?
C	no
A	six meals
C	I don't think it's mainly six but
A	erm
C	I
A	er er no
B	as in all
A	three
B	erm
A	three meals for four people they started this
B	in on plates?
A	no no no no it's all the ingredients for six
C	well no
A	for for these three meals that can feed four people right?
B	really?
A	the ingredients
B	what from Tesco's?
A	no not from from Tesco's from somewhere else
B	oh
A	from this firm erm that they give you the recipe and if you need a teaspoonful of salt there's a wee packet with a teaspoonful
C	no
A	of salt
C	they they the they use their salt
B	really?
C	I think mm
A	oh well
C	mm
A	you know or
C	but
B	yeah
A	half a teaspoonful of paprika
C	spices and
B	yeah
A	erm anything that is
B	oh
A	it is all there
B	wow
A	the whole thing is there
B	yeah
A	right? and you get the recipe so you have to cook it
B	yeah
A	and they got it when
B	oh
A	and you know and are trying to give them new
B	yeah
A	her new things all the time erm and she's at work
B	yeah
A	and it's fascinating
B	oh wow I didn't know that kind of thing existed
A	yes yes they they they invited us for a meal of one of them
A	and one one of these days we are going to get a box because
C	and you get
B	what are they called then? do you know?
C	they get a yes they get a
C	free meal every now well every
A	mm
B	yeah
C	give it away to somebody so but it but it's publicity
B	oh okay
C	you know
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	and erm
A	to a friend
C	to
B	to a friend
C	to a friend yes
B	oh what a great idea
C	and er
A	I've never and and to be honest for people who erm
B	yeah
A	love their grub and like cooking
B	yeah
A	but erm cos you've got as I say you've got to cook it
B	mm
A	and you've got to follow the recipe
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	I mean I would eat the same dinner till it was finished
B	yeah
A	before it had turned and like changes who are erm well enough off to sort of just
B	yeah
A	can order this cos obviously it's a bit more expensive than
B	yeah
A	erm erm er what a brilliant idea
B	yeah
A	er
C	well
B	yeah
C	er a couple of their friends it was er are vegetarians and found it out and then
A	that's right and they live in London actually
C	mm
A	er
B	yeah
A	but
B	well I suppose especially if people you know if you're quite busy both are working
A	uhu
B	then it
A	mm mm
B	it cuts out all that sort of what shall we
A	mm
B	oh what do we do is there a
C	the they are perfect candidates for it
B	yeah
A	mm
C	no children
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	both working
B	yes
A	mm
B	yes
C	erm
B	and they don't necessarily er want packet meals but they just don't want
A	in
B	at that time
A	in the
B	mm
A	in sort of like a smallish kitchen
B	yeah
A	to have twenty million things around and er
B	well with sometimes if you want to cook something
A	mm
B	really nice as well to buy all the
A	that's what I mean you've got to you've got to
B	yeah
A	you've to have spaces to keep them all
B	yeah
A	erm
A	erm
B	that's a very good idea
A	I
A	and some company
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	they they're
B	I know supermarkets are doing that a bit more anyway aren't in
A	mm
B	erm
A	erm
B	maybe it'll come down
A	but but
unknown_female	oh yeah
B	where they're they're selling ingredients but all packaged up
A	mm
B	so it would be like these are the vegetables to go with this whatever so you can kind of
A	uhu
B	cook it but you don't have to
C	mm yes yeah
B	so it's a popular idea generally
C	Tesco don't do that
A	mm
B	no M and S
C	so you can
B	and erm
C	Waitrose probably?
C	uhu
A	but I just thought
B	it's cook it or something
A	what a very good idea
B	they're called and they have just
A	erm I would hate it myself you know you've got to eat all of these blooming things
B	yeah
A	but
A	but what a brilliant idea for people as I say who
B	yeah
A	who don't necessarily you know and I mean if you've got children it would be a bit expensive just for the two of you
B	yeah
A	and then you'd have to cook separately
B	yeah
A	you know
A	erm
B	but especially the two of them that nice stage where you haven't got kids and you're
A	mm mm
B	you're grown up enough to experiment
B	cheese on toast you're after the university years
C	but also you've got
A	that's right
C	you've got two incomes so
A	mm yeah
C	erm
B	yeah you've got two incomes
A	and do you know but they they go out in the on they've got so three three
B	yeah
A	they actually go out one night
B	oh that's
C	no they
B	nice
C	go out two nights I think
B	do they?
A	oh no well well
C	the
A	they ought to
C	no there's three recipes this is what they told me they eat they eat it as supper
B	uhu
A	yes
C	and then he he
A	oh I see
B	oh
A	oh right so they go out a lot then
C	yeah they go out
B	and they go out to pubs twice a week
A	mm but er erm
B	and they get er pub meals do you think? that's quite nice I quite like the sound of that
A	and of course they live
A	and they live
A	in
B	oh yeah
A	er which is very near
B	very central
A	the
B	yeah
A	erm lots of eateries around them
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and er they've er renewed the lease for a year
B	oh have they?
A	what darling?
B	they like that house though don't they?
C	I think he he's going to sit up and and think
C	of something else he's got to do
B	he does that all the time as well he'll come up and kind of go night-night and you think oh he might actually stay there a bit you know goodnight
B	it's his game and like straight after
B	up and down up down up down
A	oh but that was lovely
B	I don't I don't think he's gonna put on weight
C	mm
C	well that started from the leftover rice
A	no that started from the leftover
B	ah
B	sometimes the best things do don't they?
A	erm er but it was erm but we and as I say we do see them we do
B	yeah
A	er erm
B	but not just quite

C	I grew a moustache first
B	did you?
C	this was after my marriage had broken up so
A	oh er didn't er I never knew you
C	yeah
A	with a beard and that's it
C	well she knew me because we
A	as as no but as as a husband
C	but but not as a husband no
A	no no
C	I but I grew a moustache and then erm
B	oh
C	and
B	when people separate
B	it's just
C	er and then erm and then I had erm
A	how long did it take you to grow your beard can you remember?
C	I went
A	for how long?
C	and it took me
B	five years
C	no no no I'm er actually in terms of I'm er my I don't grow a heavy beard I mean I don't have any
B	yeah
C	up here at all
B	I think it's good I don't like heavy beards
C	and er I don't grow a heavy beard
B	yeah
C	and I erm
C	for for my prostate
A	I'm going to get a drink at this point
C	and er yeah
B	yeah
C	I have pills for my prostate and she said well obviously
B	yeah
C	they're some sort of hormone pills
B	yeah
C	cos she said that er probably grow er my my
B	oh right yes
C	but which it does
B	yeah
C	a little
B	yeah
C	but the extraordinary thing is that my hair's growing slowly too
B	oh really?
C	I've had this
B	yeah
C	this is six months
B	oh really?
C	I haven't been to the barber for six months
B	oh
C	and erm
B	I didn't know that it could affect things so so dramatically
C	I remember the well
B	yeah
C	er which is a male thing so I think they bung in some sort of female hormones and
B	yeah
C	all that sort of thing but erm
B	yeah
C	er er
B	yeah
C	no
B	yeah
C	it doesn't seem
A	oh your mother would be so proud of you
C	but er
A	cos she used to hate it cos
B	yeah
A	deliberately
B	yeah
A	wait well maybe not deliberately but er there was a part of it deliberate because his mother used to
B	yeah
A	erm and
C	well you remember that sort of a hairdo
B	yes
A	yes and it got quite kind of curly and wild
B	oh
C	well it when it starts
B	yeah
C	sticking out growing out that way
B	yeah
C	that I used to think that perhaps I ought to have it cut
B	yeah that was quite curly at the ends wasn't it?
A	yeah
C	cos erm the erm
A	and your beard grew quite erm big
C	but not
B	yeah
A	kind of fulsome but kind of
A	his his mum used to
A	till he said he'd do it
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah not as thin as
C	just it's just
B	most blokes go thin though don't they?
C	it's just thinning out I think
B	yeah
C	isn't it? whereas erm
B	mm
A	well even I'm
C	the thing that
A	going going
B	but isn't it's that
C	but
A	on top
B	I've got friends who are a bit like you know maybe you're kind of like
C	yeah
B	I think it's the
C	well I I I had a biopsy here and er just under the beard there
B	yeah
C	and that was
A	about three weeks yes
C	about three weeks
A	mm
C	ago
B	yeah
C	and erm I I bought the trimmer so that I er cos it's it buying a trimmer is cheaper than keeping on going to to the barber's
B	oh yeah
C	to to get your
B	yeah
C	your beard er
A	seven quid
C	trimmed down
B	yeah
A	to get your beard trimmed
C	no it's it's
B	yeah
C	it's less than that but it's
A	oh less than that and anyway the barber's scarpered
C	but about
B	oh yeah
C	but
A	when it matters eh?
C	about
B	yeah
C	but the erm but erm but even so it's only twenty quid to buy the machine so I mean
B	yeah
C	you only have to get it done four times and you've and you make your money
C	and that's quite a good machine erm
B	yeah
C	but the but erm so so this what I've got here is is three weeks' worth which is I think is pretty pathetic
A	no I think it's actually quite good for somebody of your age I mean I don't really know I don't know
C	no no I don't know
A	erm
C	but I er I just feel but yes because I'm going regularly to have my skin cancer checked
B	yeah
C	erm I've got to take it I mean I take
B	yeah
C	don't have to
B	yeah
C	right down but
B	and I think it's better as well cos you can if you right you really shave it and there's just a little bit like a people poking round here you just get slight
A	I don't I don't know but it I've never known
B	no
A	you actually did get it shaved once
B	but the
A	right off
C	compared with
A	yeah
C	you know and er
B	he did yeah
A	mm
C	erm
A	erm but it's just I mean some
B	but
C	have
A	really?
B	yeah
C	who is it?
B	and
A	and
C	oh have they?
B	loads loads of men just now have got
A	mm
C	yeah
B	er the other male people in my family
C	I suppose you know
C	one would be one would be trimmed right down
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and of course lots of them have to shave er as they
B	yeah
C	they keep it trimmed down
B	yeah
C	but of course
A	and I think those those were designer beards
C	of course
A	but which erm

A	mm
B	palate has got broader as it got larger
B	but I just felt

C	it's it's it's very funny with
B	oh yes
C	the whole of
A	not the whole of
C	I know that
A	dear
A	in
C	but you you could say
B	yeah
C	twenty million and so I
C	can say
C	the whole of
B	they do seem to have like a big
B	yeah
B	that's true isn't it?
C	er celebrations
B	yeah they are all
C	and
B	the same age aren't they?
C	they all seem to be the same age
B	yeah
C	and erm
A	old
B	yeah there are lots
A	and they're all pals
B	and he says there's loads of barbeques aren't there? and all that kind of stuff

B	I mean they
C	yeah I mean
B	they're not just once in a blue moon
C	oh no no no
B	like
C	oh they're very well settled in
B	yeah
C	and erm
B	but they go away to Center Parcs as well and that kind of thing don't they?
C	oh yeah well
A	as as as a group
C	about twenty of them
B	yeah
C	and they all go away and
B	they said they can't stop like I was thinking
B	like what's the demographic?
C	I know and
A	also also
C	they the the
A	they all have three children
B	oh really?
A	except for
C	they're all
A	the the the the few who have got twins er
B	oh
B	oh right
C	it's
C	it's a terrible
B	god
C	pressure on primary school places in
A	oh yes they
B	oh
A	had to build a whole
B	really?
A	new bit in the playground yes
B	really? wow
A	mm it's almost double the size now
B	oh goodness
A	mm and erm
B	wow
C	and it's erm
A	erm yes and as this er young gentleman erm who is born and bred there
A	er
A	blamed it on all the incomers and I like to think oh my goodness that my
B	yeah
A	my children are incomers here
B	I think there's pressure
A	but the
B	been everywhere hasn't there?
A	I said I as I explained to him
B	and they'll have to build a new school
A	erm
B	build a new school in
A	well
B	cos of the pressure
A	mm yes
B	for places
C	well what?
A	but but
A	do you do you know what happened?
B	they're building
C	you see but the problem they have
A	mm
C	is erm they
B	the
C	er cos I I was in on the discussions of this when I was a councillor
B	oh so you're in the know?
C	erm and er there's er which was that they they said oh erm
B	yeah
C	they said oh well we won't have any children there because this
C	you know and they said we we won't need
B	oh
C	a new school or anything like that
B	but then what happens
C	but
B	what happens to the newly marrieds?
C	apparently er the place is is crawling with children
B	with kids oh
C	erm er because erm
B	yeah
A	it won't be the the right
C	no these these flats which are near
A	no no
C	the station
C	which are by er well they're not in the station obviously they
A	the the station ones are all for students
C	no I know but the
B	yeah
C	if you go to the left
B	yeah
C	you've got
A	where
C	student families with children
B	yeah
C	and that sort of thing
B	yeah
A	but where
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh
C	no no
A	oh right
C	crawling with children
C	er and just as well
B	yeah
C	like he
C	but the erm er but the point is
B	yeah
C	if they can't increase the size of
B	yeah
C	er it's there's
B	yeah
C	and there is nowhere in erm the centre of
B	yeah oh yeah in the centre yeah
C	is is er it's and they do not
B	there's one in
C	well the the I think they have increased the size of erm er what was it?
A	I don't really know that area very
A	mm
C	erm
C	er but but I don't think it's a new school there but I think they've
B	cos
C	doubled the size of one
B	oh right
C	so they
B	I think there's going to be a I only just saw it the other day it was just erm er no they had some they had the plans and I don't know how off you know how long away it's going to be
C	oh right
B	before it can open
C	yeah
B	but it but it was around a sort of
C	I'm saying it's not built yet
B	it's not built yet
C	no no no
B	so
A	mm
B	but you're saying
C	so we're not
B	is that there's actually
C	well er
B	nowhere to build somewhere like for example around by the station where there's so many new places
C	but that's right and
B	so what what do you do? I suppose
C	they think they they think they're
B	what do you do?
C	going to have to bus them
C	out
B	wow
C	erm
A	well because the there's another one quite near there and it was called was it
B	is that
A	erm er
B	oh yeah
A	and then there was the
B	yeah
A	that erm I looked after in their older age one of the teachers that taught there
B	yeah
A	but that's sort of erm erm along
B	yeah
C	are you sure that's not private?
B	it it wasn't a private school
C	oh
B	okay
A	it wasn't a private school that erm
B	yeah
A	erm
C	but
A	erm
C	but you've got erm
A	the
B	oh
C	you've got several er er
A	I do know
C	sort of going out
B	yeah
A	I had three children
B	yeah
A	what did you all do? you went into your own houses
B	yeah
A	and you had your children
B	yes
A	now
A	it's not just all foreigners we produce children
A	who produce children who all need housing
C	yeah but the the
B	I I I think we're erm like about two though aren't we?
A	mm
B	one point eight or two
C	the the fact that
B	I think generally
A	I think one point eight
B	as in generally as in
C	I mean well we
B	we've generally
C	I mean
B	mm
C	and
B	mm
B	yeah
C	and erm they er
D	yellow
C	and so
D	yellow
B	and excuse me
C	and and so the er so
D	yellow
B	yellow
C	but also quite a
A	she's with an Irish fellow
C	quite quite
C	yeah but to not er
B	I did the
C	the not not looking for schooling here
B	yeah I know
C	yeah but no the point is that erm but there were a lot of Polish couples particularly
B	yeah
C	Polish
B	yeah
C	erm and erm er I mean you well walk around
A	mm
C	Polish you hear is you know
A	and what's lovely in
B	yeah
A	right the school that
B	yeah
A	erm there are other people who you know obviously born and bred
B	yeah
A	right but there erm there was a definite influx first of all of visiting erm academics
B	yeah
A	who would be there for a year or two years
B	yeah
A	er mainly of the Japanese variety
A	you know and
B	oh
A	I mean they had to move out
B	yeah
A	you know to to places
B	yeah
A	a bit out
B	yeah
A	erm the but the rents are cheaper
B	yeah
A	erm housing is cheaper erm but there were quite a few not all Polish but eastern European
B	eastern European
A	and you could you could see that the not so much the difference cos actually
B	yeah
A	erm quite a few of the born and bred people
B	yeah
A	also were sort of in there for pushing their children and doing things
B	yeah
A	and and and
B	yeah
A	erm but er
B	yeah
A	er I thought oh it'll be sort of like erm erm not quite as sort of like
B	yeah
A	you know? erm and
B	I suppose it's just the bulk is isn't it like twenty-five percent of births are to non-nationals? that's a lot
C	I think I've said yeah
A	really?
B	yeah yeah I think it's
C	oh
B	twenty percent for
A	in in in this area?
B	erm and and
A	or just in the
B	in the UK as a whole I think
A	as a whole
B	I think it's the UK as a whole
A	really?
B	yeah so so
A	that is
B	suddenly like wow
A	wow
B	quick more midwives more schools
B	and more er
A	yeah
A	and it
B	policing and
C	yeah
A	I mean I can understand
A	I mean to me it doesn't matter because
B	yeah
A	I've got an income
B	yeah
A	erm erm but
B	well yes you heathen Scots you
B	I mean
C	no it's that
A	but actually but I do
A	I do feel that I've
B	yes
A	come down somehow managed to just settle in the south east of England for some strange reason but
B	just cos there are more
A	uhu
B	you're not so you'll move to the places where there will be in the south east
A	that's right that's right but erm erm
B	whereas I've done completely the opposite and I've moved the places
B	with more recession more
A	but er we just have we've got one life to live dear
B	yeah
C	erm
B	and it's got trouble is
A	mm
B	which I don't think they they are properly but you don't know where people are gonna end up so how do you plan for services?
C	but but that they
A	yeah
C	they
B	oh
C	the news it was a quarter of an hour between the news and erm and erm er the erm erm what the er?
A	or whatever it was
C	er well
B	yeah
C	your your programme and er
A	oh right
C	yeah The Archers
A	the Archers
C	The Archers
C	it was that quarter of an hour there and they were talking about they did
A	this is the wireless
C	did were doing a series for a week of that in that slot
A	mm
C	and er the rest of about British people who moved to various places
B	oh yeah
C	and erm
B	oh yeah?
A	really?
C	yeah and apparently quite a lot of
B	oh yeah?
C	and so they've bought their own house and
B	oh right yes I'll just er
B	yeah
C	but but also
B	yeah
C	but but they're but the apparently er they can live very comfortably on just the
B	yeah
C	state pension
B	yeah
C	which is about eight times the and I know that that it was eight times he said it was eight times the pension
A	erm that's er
C	the the pension of Bulgarian old people
B	oh really? wow
C	and erm
B	so you'd be just
C	but also they get things like
B	quality of life
C	because the we've got a a mutual agreement with erm
B	yeah
C	er er
B	ah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	and they say that
B	the medical practitioners
A	care
C	care there er is is
B	yeah
C	brilliant they say
B	oh okay
C	it's really brilliant yes
B	mm
C	erm even if you want to go private because if you
B	yeah
C	and erm but apparently
A	well we'd never have thought
C	er because the
A	of Bulgaria as a place
C	because that
B	no
C	we have a mutual agreement
B	yeah
C	but we've got
B	oh right
C	and so apparently all these wealthy English people who
B	hey
C	are there
B	yeah
C	get free healthcare
B	yeah
C	but the Bulgarians don't
B	oh
C	the Bulgarians
B	oh right interesting
C	have to pay a certain amount
B	I didn't know
C	to and to a
A	you'd pay a lot if you
C	amount towards it
A	I would imagine
C	and er
B	yeah
C	she they said that that someone was saying they say they're erm amazingly philosophical about it
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	obviously it's tough for them and erm
A	mm
B	yeah maybe if
A	mm
B	I know there's a well I suppose it's all kind of a big experiment to sort of see how things pan out maybe when the young ones come here all the older ones will go somewhere else
C	yeah
A	perhaps there's a sort of demographic shift you know
C	but
A	where old people
B	yeah
C	apparently er
A	we're not moving
B	to Bulgaria?
A	we're not moving anywhere
B	Uzbekistan
A	I
C	no
A	mm no er
C	no
A	no I think it's erm but it is interesting
B	mm
A	erm and I haven't a clue
B	yeah
A	erm but erm but that people desperately need housing I feel oh it's
B	yeah
A	breaks your heart I
B	yeah
A	erm and there are lots
C	I mean they're
A	according to what they say they
B	yeah
A	inverted commas they say
B	yeah
A	erm you know erm
B	mm
A	because er people get housing benefit right?
B	yeah
A	erm now when we were letting out that house in
B	yeah
A	and there was only one lad and he wasn't bad
B	oh yeah
A	erm and cos I kept getting
B	oh right
A	I kept getting letters from him for him you know
B	yeah
A	until I actually wrote in the letter he does not live here any more and I never get any more but erm
B	yeah
A	er but I hadn't a clue I needed thirty pounds a week
B	yeah
A	for a month or whatever it was
B	yeah

B	yeah
A	so that's what what I let it out for
