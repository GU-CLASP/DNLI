A	what the hell? did you put a sign up in the bathroom or something?
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	for sale
D	like a really small one for sale but only people who notice the details
A	just do it in toilet graffiti
B	now you need er now you need them to like go against each other I guess
A	I know well that's the idea
D	yeah we're trying to play them
B	you should introduce the woman the girl to the other one so er
D	yeah and what do you think would happen?
B	so that they can be betting well not betting but competing not only for the restaurant but for the girl
D	yeah that's a good point a very good point
D	I was telling

B	just to the world you know that people aren't are
D	I think it does help with sort of like media coverage massively if it
A	maybe it will
B	yeah cos for the
A	that was crazy er did you all see it? yeah?
D	no I didn't see it I read about it
D	yeah pretty
B	they're all empty
A	no
B	except the
B	yeah except except the
A	mm
B	that we all know have chocolate and
D	yeah but this is Christmas this is Christmas this is exactly what happens
A	this is what happens what do you think happens? we take er we all take an even share of the gross ones and nice ones
D	yeah
B	but there's not
D	at some point we all have to try one of the gross ones and then spit it out again
D	and that's part of the thing
A	back onto the tree
D	yeah
B	I got coffee
B	I quite like it actually
D	on Friday the nineteenth
A	next Friday
D	next Friday and then we're going on out on Saturday
A	what are we doing? what's the plan?
D	I don't know you've got to go to
A	just go out?
D	yeah just go out
A	that's easy I'm well good at
D	are you?
A	yeah er
D	yeah
A	do you wanna eat?
D	erm cos we said I dunno maybe yeah
A	it's very easy to eat good things
D	yeah
A	without organising anything too you know
D	yeah maybe we'll eat early
A	could go to
D	yeah we could go to
A	or whatever like
D	yeah
A	you can eat at any point you can eat till late and stuff
D	yeah erm
A	so that's cool
D	I'm just worried that there's gonna be quite a few people
A	how many?
B	yeah it's er
D	I've no idea it depends how many actually come out into town
A	more than ten?
D	no I I don't know maybe
A	then the important thing to do is to start early what time do you finish work?
D	yeah
A	erm try and maybe like go straight there?
D	but you guys could all start sooner cos I don't think
A	I mean if we can go straight er yeah okay the earlier the better
D	yeah
A	because the worst thing to once you're er like already having fun then it doesn't matter if places are full and hectic but if you go out and you're trying to squeeze into a busy bar it's kind of a
D	yeah
A	on a Saturday night
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	it seems like a shit idea
D	yeah
A	but like so it just always gets into a whirlwind and then it's fine you know
D	yeah
A	so let's just try and go early
D	okay
A	what does he want?
D	to do?
A	for his birthday what does he want?
A	just to have fun?
D	I think he just basically wants to have fun I don't think he particularly wants
A	cool erm on Christmas the fifteenth
D	yep
A	erm
D	yeah
A	should I make those? do you wanna make those? I mean
D	mince pies?
A	mm
D	I think he wants them doesn't he? is it cos?
A	cos er don't we have to soak fruit for quite a long?
D	if er because it's near his birthday does that mean we just have to do whatever he wants?
A	just cos he really wants them I feel like he's like ah oh ah
A	I thought well in the morning we'll get
D	no man you just fucking buy mincemeat don't you? you just you don't make it
A	really?
B	mince meat?
D	yeah you just buy it
A	I'll make it but er it's gonna
D	or you can make it er but
A	yeah
B	you buy er you have mince meat in mince pies?
D	well no it's just called mincemeat
A	that's what it's called it's called mincemeat
D	it used to have er meat in it but
A	in the old days like mince and pudding like pudding was savoury and like
D	they've all fucking mixed it up didn't they?
A	its all gone back and forth so many times
A	but yeah those two things like have come out of
A	but
D	but we all know what we're talking about except for
A	but like okay so do you wanna make the pastry?
D	okay so the the only thing the I I the the only thing is that I think we should we should divide the tasks
A	yeah
D	basically
A	well I was gonna do
D	at the moment I don't
D	oh
D	no cos he said that
A	perhaps you can make them like this or
D	er he said that you
A	that's not true
A	can't believe he said that what did he say? oh I think we should use your recipe
D	no he said that you don't have like a go to recipe that's what
A	oh no
D	interesting
D	anyway
A	I don't anymore
D	no obviously well anyway we won't
D	I don't know what happened I wasn't even there
A	no no no no no well I well I don't care I can't I can't be bothered to make them
A	I just wanna know if I have to or not and if so do I have to do yours?
D	you don't have to do anything you don't want to do
B	what can I make?
A	I mean er I I would I I'd be well up for doing desserts but I'm not I don't I'm not that bothered about mince pies
A	but like it's er
D	but we do need something in the morning
A	yeah but
B	can't you just have like cava?
D	good point a good point well made
A	cava I mean I can I can make something
B	what about like smoked salmon?
D	can you just
B	yeah
D	have to get the oysters on a Monday bad idea
A	er anything else besides mince pies? anyone likes
B	I don't like mince pies
D	I love mince pies
A	shall I just make mince pies?
D	why don't you just make a different kind of pie? no he wouldn't like that
A	we'll make the fucking pie that he wants
B	I don't mind going to get oysters
A	can you put cream cheese on top?
D	oh please put cream cheese on top
A	no I really don't mind making mince pies but just give me your recipe because
D	it's okay the only thing I do is I just put orange in the pastry shortcrust pastry
A	mm
D	and then you put a little
A	and you buy mincemeat?
D	yeah that's it it's just my dad's recipe that he used to do it's just really good
A	and do you do a sweet shortcrust pastry? or savoury?
D	sweet with orange in
A	that's easy I'll do that
D	yeah
A	and you'll be happy
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'll do it
D	it doesn't have to be anything special you just
A	no I I just think it's lolz I don't care I've got no feelings attached to this at all
B	yeah you do
A	no I don't
A	and it was just interesting
A	I'm gonna make the pastry tomorrow that's what's gonna happen
D	yeah so just slice a bit of orange in anyway it's not important as long as it doesn't even matter as long as there are pies in the morning cos it's
A	jesus christ
D	we'll have to get a goose and we'll have to
A	got a goose I'm trying to get the best goose possible
D	yeah I'm really excited about the goose
B	how big is a goose? having a whole goose? are you gonna have to pluck it
A	yeah it will be plucked
D	yeah you don't give someone a bird with all the feathers on that's kind of weird
D	although
B	I just
D	oh yeah no
B	while it was still warm
D	no we did kill a goose last year
A	er
D	yeah that was
D	and we plucked it
A	er oh man
D	a goose it's gonna be sick
A	geese are a bit weird once they get to a certain size they put weight on the bone rather than breast so you have as much meat on a small one as on a big one so he said he's gonna get a small one
A	no?
D	if you start putting oh
A	fat on instead of meat
D	oh it's meat on on the bone so they start getting heavier but no no no that doesn't make sense
A	he no no he's like er rather than like flesh they just get fat like a bigger layer of fat
D	oh er oh like people
A	after a certain weight cos er turkeys are the opposite
D	like people
A	turkeys just get like more and more flesh
D	right right right right
A	after a certain weight and less fat but he's like I've asked for a small one
D	okay
A	but so er so then we'll get the best value
D	yeah that sounds good
A	cos it's priced by weight I just said get the very best one you can whatever it is
D	yeah
A	he knows what he's doing I think
D	and how are you paying? are you gonna pay for it with with cakes?
A	I have done a job for him for which he owes me a hundred pounds he reckons that the goose'll be about fifty pounds so I'm just gonna take it off that invoice
D	okay well
A	so it's just like that so if you guys get some vegetables and I can get some too you know I don't care
D	or well
A	yeah well just I mean I really I'm not that bothered about it so erm let's just all get nice stuff there's not gonna be heaps of stuff anyway
A	and like
D	so we'll bring some wine
A	yeah
D	cos that's important
A	get wine erm
B	what shall I bring?
A	I'll get some too erm bring whatever whatever you can get your hands on parsnips?
A	Prosecco?
D	what about?
A	I dunno whatever babe er
D	it would be fun to have something fizzy
B	yeah I like that I like fizzy
A	oh a bit of Highland Spring yes
D	alright well that's
A	yeah well this is what the that's what I was originally asking what dessert shall I make? or does
D	mm not
B	so it's mince pies is for breakfast?
D	yeah that's for breakfast I
A	I'll make something up
D	Christmas steak?
B	I've never had steak for breakfast
A	really? steak and eggs
D	I've had steak for breakfast
A	do you want any extra bits?
B	I've had a Big Mac
A	Christmas steak?
A	maybe it's a mistake and he said Christmas steak
A	maybe he was being very blasphemous anyway what dessert shall I do?
B	er absinthe ice cream
D	ice cream might be nice
D	is that a massive pain in the arse though?
A	only because my ice cream machine is currently
D	yeah
A	in the cupboard of
D	my my thoughts are that
B	I'll get it out
A	will you?
D	I feel like we should only make things that aren't a fucking massive unbelievable pain in the arse
A	great I'll make it no man I can do er absinthe ice cream the only annoying thing is getting the thing out if you help me get it out
B	yeah I'll get it out
A	okay and then I just it's not really hard at all I just have to put it in the machine make
B	does that mean I have to come?
A	yeah
B	ah I dunno if I can come tomorrow
B	can you not just make something with absinthe in it?
A	like what?
B	I dunno
D	trifle? that's well Christmassy
A	trifle?
D	yeah
A	do you like trifle?
D	if it's make real nice it's real nice
A	like sherry trifle?
D	yeah you don't have to put sherry in it though
A	no no no
D	cos that's kinda gross
A	I don't put sherry in it but just like custard and coulis and cake and fruit
D	yeah
D	it's just an idea that's just what I'd have at Christmas time
A	erm er I could make a trifle
D	it's just an idea
D	if it's a bad idea we can definitely scrap it what else do you have at Christmas?
B	Christmas pudding
D	but what else? Christmas pudding but Christmas pudding is basically shit and you have to leave it for ages and ages and ages
A	you have to make it for like months
D	yeah
B	has
B	I think that you should tell the story
A	this is a real Christmas magic story
D	tell me tell me tell me
A	it's actually very lolz so basically like my father is teetotal my family are like grew up like don't drink alcohol erm it's er it's not like not a big deal we just never drank
D	yeah
A	anyway so he
D	yeah
A	just like gathering dust obviously like me and
A	and like safe in the knowledge that we'd never ever be found out cos it's just like
D	yeah
A	beyond comprehension that he'd ever look at it doesn't have any friends doesn't drink that's that so anyway erm then one Christmas we have like Christmas pudding my dad's like has this er delightful idea and he's like I know we can put brandy on it and light it you know
D	yeah
A	anyway so like runs off me and
A	like brandy's like so long gone but we always topped it up with water
A	just in case they ever moved or something and like picked up the bottles
D	yeah it was empty
A	you know but we never thought he'd try and drink it anyway so
D	fuck
A	so like he comes back and turns off the lights
A	so we're like sitting in the dark like fuck we're in so much trouble
D	oh no
A	until it's just like swimming in water but it's in the dark so you couldn't tell
A	and eventually like gave up and turned the light on and we was in so much trouble
A	it was like
D	oh fuck
A	as soon as Christmas is over you're in so much trouble
D	oh shit dude
A	well scared
B	you are in so much trouble
A	the worst was when he kept pouring more and more on
D	what did you do? were you just like trying not to laugh?
A	just just like
A	I'm too young
D	that's awesome
A	knew he knew full well who was behind it

A	I was trying to remember what the other funny thing that happened today was apart from the popping er popping pop pop
A	what was the other lol thing?
B	apart from the fact that you just said that the thing you know the popping pop pop popping pop thing
A	popcorn
A	er that popcorn is fucking delicious they just don't know
B	it was the everyone was trying it
A	mm
B	and they were like
A	yeah well that's no more free samples kind of
B	but but that girl who works in the thing next door
A	the girl who works next door? ah won't count she's my friend
B	four quid
A	fuck she's supposed to get a discount
B	I
A	erm anyway what was the other
B	did you see that girl came in asking for a
A	mm?
B	that girl like you gave her one pound discounts for her soup
A	the little girl?
B	no no that girl
A	yeah oh yeah
B	she came in again for
A	did she?
B	off a coffee
B	I gave her one
A	that's so cheeky though innit?
D	who asked for a discount?
A	well like it was just er er
D	mm
A	but everyone does like neighbourhood discount the people who really benefit from that are the people well the people who really lose out on that are the people who do
D	coffee and yeah
A	so then like all the like random like Sunday staff or like people I've never seen before who are doing a shift in like a random shop on
A	not me I was not
D	yeah
A	but then they all come in it's like that probably does cost me hundreds of pounds a year and it's not like I'm gonna
D	yeah
A	get that
D	no
A	I'm gonna get that back in Mexican underwear or whatever
B	are you gonna buy some underwear in the Mexican shop?
A	er if I take the
D	so what happened with the girl?
A	nothing I let her have it
B	yeah but it was she was gutted cos she came in the last week and bought two soups and it was eight pounds and she asked for a discount and
A	fair enough
D	yeah that's
D	that's a discount
A	she looked well pissed off though like
A	what about my staff discount?
D	oh my god
A	what am I? your uncle
D	ah that'd be so annoying
A	buy your own soup
B	still the soup was four pounds it's it's er it's expensive
A	no I don't think it's expensive you get a slice of
D	woah woah woah four pounds is not expensive for a soup
A	it's like a nice borscht that much like a soup cup and a slice of Hackney Wild
D	yeah that's like it doesn't get any cheaper than four pounds for soup
D	like you can't buy it any cheaper
B	you can at
B	it's four pounds though
A	yeah
B	yeah with stuff
D	what's
B	you get a salad
A	yeah you get a bit of salad
B	yeah I know I know okay just
A	I don't
B	yeah no
D	it's cheap
A	it er I doubt we make much profit on soup we certainly don't if we give it for three pounds
D	man you go to fucking Marks and Spencer's and you can spend three fifty on a like portion of soup in a premade packet that's made in a fucking factory
A	mm
D	you know what I mean? it's like it's bullshit
A	mm
D	it's like you actually made that with your fair hands
A	well
B	fair hands
D	alright well yeah someone's fair hands made it
A	it's more it's it's more expensive to me if it's made with
D	yeah
A	and not as good
B	although the last one was good
A	er yeah it was better but I had to give her quite specific feedback
B	well she should just kept doing that one
A	yeah but which she bought us er she accidentally bought a sack of potatoes so we have to do potato soup what's a nice soup? potato she's been doing the worst soups man don't put that on camera
B	what?
A	or me like fucking
A	mm
B	like cold er
A	cold and er it was like the texture and flavour of vom
A	but the potato soup had chunks of potato like that par cooked
B	it was called chunky er
A	chunky potato soup it's like no kidding
B	like potato with
A	this is a potato with a bit of drizzle
A	and not seasoned but she doesn't have a sense of smell
D	I don't know if she should be making soup
B	yeah I don't think so either
A	no well like that's why I've just given her one and I and just like gave her very specific feedback and then now it's erm it's nice but er we now we have to make potato soup cos we've got a sack of potatoes
D	but can't you like put potatoes in some kind of cake
A	nah no way man
A	sweet potato yes regular potato no
D	what about? what about? you could put them
A	Maris Pipers
A	or chips cake
A	this is
D	two two layer of
A	lolz
B	what's lolz?
A	nothing
B	you want more?
A	mm mm
B	do you want me to get more?
A	no man
D	what about?
A	erm chip party?
B	could have some of the red drink if you want another drink
B	I'm gonna give that to
D	good idea
A	erm do you want a sack of potatoes?
D	no we won't use a whole sack not of Maris Pipers
A	what do I do with them? I was thinking about making a thing which is like
B	you can make nice leek and potato soup
D	yeah
B	use er use your recipe
D	you can do the thing about a soup like that is you just have to be able to season it right
A	mm
A	yeah
D	you have to be able to
A	but isn't taste seventy percent smell? like actually or ninety percent or something? I mean I really think it's like mostly smell is taste
D	yeah
A	unless it's like oh chilli mm salt you know all the subtleties are in smell erm I was thinking about slicing them very thinly and then arranging them like sort of like a flower in like a cake pan
D	yeah
A	and then roasting it
D	yeah
A	would that be a nice snack?
D	yeah that'd be a nice snack with like sage or something
A	hot roast potatoes yeah
D	what? because of the olive oil harvest failed?
A	yeah do think that will really happen?
D	yeah I only heard about Italian olive oil though I don't know about the rest of the world
A	right okay
D	but I mean it's being harvested now like now so er or like yeah will've been in the last
A	before the frost
D	month or whatever yeah so I don't I still I'm not sure but I definitely know that the Italian olive oil that
A	what's he gonna do?
D	buy from someone else
