B	I don't know why
A	they've got no absorbency and they don't dry things properly even though they've been washed normally you have to wash them once for the absorbency to kick in but
B	mm
A	I don't think it has
A	and er they were almost dry and then it rained which was really annoying

B	it'll be a third off
A	the whole thing?
B	the bill
A	a third off food it just says

B	I was going to suggest nine thirty
A	well I'd really like to be able to
B	the alarm goes off at nine thirty
A	well I actually I'd like to get up when you do now cos twenty past eight is a good
B	well it's a bit
A	reasonable time
B	I suppose it's mm it's nice if you could then sort of sit in bed have a cup of tea
A	mm
B	it's just not nice having to go out do you want to
A	yeah exactly
B	give that
A	it's just the going out thing erm yeah I'm quite looking forward to doing that in fact but you know what I've been thinking about?
B	erm
A	that cushion you sent me
B	yes
A	the knitting pattern I don't know whether it's worth me doing that just because it would make me happy
B	yeah a reckon it's a big liquidy
A	mm
B	I shall cook it out we'll taste it and then deem it whether it's alright or not
A	yeah
B	please put them on your
A	yeah I think they already are I did that shop and never bought it so I think they're
B	yeah
A	on that
B	I know you never bought it
A	sorry darling but I'm gonna do one and then er all the it'll have to last us for the month one of my big ones
B	thank you
A	I might the traditional Fiorentina
A	I am
B	Pizza Express are you?
A	I'm already thinking about it
B	do you like the one er
A	I used to I don't know whether they do the one that I really like any more
B	the egg one?
A	no
B	you always used to have the egg on
A	there was a blue cheese one it was a kind of new addition
B	that's correct darling
B	you mean the salad in the middle?
A	yeah and it was thin it wasn't as doughy as the other ones
B	that's their Romana bases
A	but it had I think it had a hole in the middle
B	that's what I just said
A	no you didn't say hole in the middle
B	I said there's a hole in the middle
A	oh maybe you did
B	maybe I said with salad in the middle
A	anyway
B	but
A	but salad in the middle yes
B	cos that's what we're eating
A	pasta and chicken interesting can I cut the chicken a little bit smaller?
B	yeah if you want
A	I like little pieces
B	yeah okay so is the kettle boiling?
A	have a look it's behind you
B	oh you've put it on yeah
A	negotiating a barrier
B	oh
A	no?
B	thinking about it
A	oh have a think
B	got some chicken darling but
A	does he eat that sort of chicken though?
B	he would if you chopped it a bit finer for him
A	oh he's going straight out again
B	erm
A	what the one in
B	that's what people buy from
A	no not
B	Marks and Spencer's
A	we won't be buying that
B	okay
A	we'll be shopping in there properly
B	er probably pizza and garlic bread
A	yeah that's what I think
A	or
B	oh I won't be having that I hate premade salads
A	yeah but I really
B	sorry
A	like it
B	darling I'll need a bit more
A	and I'm on my own so for
B	I'll need a bit
A	example
B	I need a bit more water in there please
A	if you were at
B	silly things
A	their scotch eggs are really nice oh do you want me to boil it first?
B	well
A	no I'll boil it
B	that can go back that's not finished might be useful we could have a curry tomorrow
A	oh I've had a lot of the yogurt
B	yeah there's enough
A	no you have looked
B	well unless you
A	did you looked
B	eaten it within the last fifteen minutes
A	that
B	that's enough
A	oh okay
B	want to buy my mummy some flowers and send them?
A	yeah I want to buy her a Nutribullet and send it
A	I think that she would
B	did not work all day
A	what darling?
B	Amazon hasn't been working all day
B	I'll do Interflora again did it with my mum why why are we sending her flowers?
B	cos she's got a hole in her leg and I suppose that's
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it's Mother's Day
A	oh yeah of course that is
B	not that I normally do anything about that
A	well I could do mother-in-law's day
B	right we're ready to go dear
A	when's Mother's Day?
B	Mother's Day's next Sunday
A	I get
B	all the shops are full of crap
A	yeah hold on it's yeah Mothering Sunday
B	maybe I should have that posh red wine
A	tonight?
B	would be nice but we might as well save it for something
A	I won't like that so you're welcome to it
A	oh that's the other thing I could probably get from the new Marks and Spencer's cos they used to do fizzy pink wine which I liked
B	maybe the first thing we'll do is one of those meals for ten pounds
A	oh yeah
B	cos that shop'll specialise in that kind of
A	yes for the people on the
B	product
A	estate
B	from home
A	for the posh estate people they will want that so they will specialise in it but
A	do they still do ten pound deals? or was that just
B	yeah
A	a recession thing?
B	well they did a Valentine's Day one at twenty pounds
A	are we still officially in a recession or not?
A	yeah we'll er do that
B	so I set up a very complicated read on
A	oh yeah?
B	well some of them it was horse welfare
A	it's terrible really
B	and then stupidly one section on horse welfare and one section on equine welfare
A	that's the same thing
B	exactly
A	mm
B	well two of the other searches
A	in a race
B	were
A	and then you suddenly realise that that must hurt
B	well one of the searches related to the use of the whip
A	mm
B	and one of them er some of them were horse er animal cruelty charities
A	yeah
B	in relation to horse racing
A	yeah
B	right ten minutes is
A	did you know that a male rabbit is a buck?
B	probably there's the other word that I keep forgetting which is a male hare which is an interesting word
A	what what would you call a young horse? there's pony and there's
B	foal
A	foal but there's also colt
B	colt yes there is
A	well what's the difference?
B	I dunno
A	why is a colt a colt and not a pony?
B	well a pony's not a horse
A	perhaps it's certain ages of horses
A	a pony is a horse
B	yeah
A	well a pony's a young horse
B	oh it's good darling
A	but there's funny things that keep coming up in crosswords and you wonder why
B	it's fourteen years old this wine
A	oh better not have me drink that when I'm in my zone then
A	yeah
B	two thousand and two
A	oh it's two thousand and sixteen now oh yeah two thousand and two so what were you doing in two thousand and two?
B	oh would you get the colander out for me darling?
A	I can
B	I'd met you
A	no you met me in about two thousand
B	oh
A	and three
B	okay two thousand and two I was living in
A	so your life only started from two thousand and three so you probably can't remember like the dark ages in history
B	I was living
A	it's just a big blank
B	I was living in
A	yeah
B	with
A	what was I doing?
B	must have been or had we just moved to
A	I would have been in
B	I left
A	well I left it then I came back
B	or two thousand and one probably two thousand no it would have been two thousand cos I wasn't there for a year
A	two thousand and no I'd already started working as a transcriber in two thousand and two and I started in two thousand I think as a transcriber
B	hello
A	and then
B	going straight out again or what?
A	I think I met you in two thousand and three
B	maybe he wants to finish his supper but it's too much crashing and
A	yeah it's too much
B	and he doesn't like the smells
A	too many distractions
B	oh
A	oh stop
B	that needs a clean
A	there's got to be some cleaning done stop everything and clean yes that's right
B	mm
A	oh and now he's
B	and out
A	oh what's he gonna do next?
B	don't know I
A	is he going to go for the chicken or oh
B	who knows it's
A	it's not your usual is it darling? it's a bit real
B	oh
A	oh on the floor
B	oh that's a good sign
A	as well
A	still a bit of money only just got paid it's all gone immediately as soon as I've got it
B	yeah
A	I think you might be wrong about that
B	no I'm
A	mm mm terrible waste if she didn't cos that's a very good gift for someone who does use it
B	plus who was it who said they're just a blender? so
A	most people say that aren't in aren't into health drinks say what's that? it's a blender isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and I say yes but not like any blender
B	but it does the same function and she just needs blender
A	it's rather different I don't even compare it to a blender really cos you can't put whole pieces of
B	darling you've washed up actually the cooking
A	er hello I'm talking
B	yeah but you've washed up the cooking implements now
A	yes you can't put whole
B	yes
A	asparagus in a blender
A	and have it come out as something you can drink
B	well yes you can
A	in fact no it wouldn't try putting it in that one we'll do a test if you want
B	I don't mean shit blenders oh no yeah that's a good blender
A	only it wouldn't do what that Nutribullet does
B	well that basically is a Nutribullet
A	no you couldn't put what I put in the Nutribullet it wouldn't work it wouldn't blend it
A	no it wouldn't blend it darling you can
B	I could have had
A	try it if you want
A	but actually we never use it because you always use the hand blender for soups
B	yeah
A	and I always use that for smoothies so it we could free up another shelf
B	Ebay
A	in my in my erm
B	Ebay
A	clearing out
B	I made a joke under my breath
A	oh I found your secret message on my
A	recording
A	I love
B	ah sweet
B	yeah
A	I was in the loo
B	yes you were
B	that's what I said
A	down for posterity now
B	is it?
A	yes
B	can't use the name though
A	not in my name no
B	oh have you left that bit darling?
A	cos I wanted bread if I have juice I'm not that hungry
B	yes
A	it fills me up
B	what about timings? if you got up at nine thirty
A	yeah it's true
B	set your alarm for nine thirty
A	I know darling
B	would have a be hungry for lunch by about about the same time I have lunch
A	well yeah you do get more hungry
B	oneish twoish
A	hungrier more hungry hungrier
B	more hungrier
A	hungrier
B	are there episodes of Trapped to watch?
A	I don't know
B	when are they going to air the last
A	Shetland?
A	I don't know that either I suppose that's
B	that'll be a week after this one
A	Friday they keep taking it out
B	I'm not here Friday
B	so
A	no
B	Walking Dead
A	a Walking Dead
A	mm and a House of Cards
B	could you get me out of fork to check the pasta please?
A	Walking Dead's quite good cos you can leave it for a while and then go back to it and it
B	there's no complexity
A	you don't seem to have a
B	of plot or character that would leave you confused
A	well also they're fairly self-contained episodes as well
B	yeah
A	they're always a little bit self-contained so which is what I think works about it
B	flashback counterstory
A	if anything I think House of Cards is more like something that you need to keep tabs on and keep watching
B	I'm not so sure cos they're quite self-contained as well
A	oh true yeah
B	it's been
A	they are actually
B	Trapped and thing where you just forget who the hell is who
A	well I still wanna know who that character is
B	she's not in any more so we don't really need to know
A	and I really want to know though cos it's crucial is that the twist that
B	no I think she erm
A	I think that must be later
B	no I think I failed to mention in the last episode there was a massive
A	avalanche
B	avalanche so she's probably be thinking about that
A	oh it's not really a twist that's just a big happening
B	I think that's what she meant
A	that's not what I'd call a plot twist
B	well I think that's what she meant
A	oh okay well you've still got to do a recording with
B	uhu
A	are you gonna see her this week at all? oh look he's left a little bit on the floor
B	yes I know
A	he took it out
B	had a think
A	had a think mm
B	oh
A	a really funny noise
A	what were you doing? were you singing or something?
B	I was singing
A	and how was he looking at you?
B	I can't remember now darling
B	it was a little sideways
A	I get that look when
B	sideways
A	I'm doing a singing practice
B	when you're doing a little exercising
B	exercises
A	or he just leaves the room quietly and politely
B	well it's annoying
B	right plates do you mind having that plate? or would you like a normal plate?
A	er I'd like one of those plates I don't mind what plate actually
B	the snug it's not been made warm but it's probably
A	it will be warmish now
B	want to check that for me? it's brown pasta so it's never gonna be it's a bit hot
A	hot
B	done?
A	yeah oh no maybe not
B	yeah it is
A	yeah well slightly al dente
B	well
A	if that's what you want
B	brown pasta's always
A	Spoonula I'm not sure if that's come into the language yet
B	I think so
A	it's a
B	plates
A	it's a trade name
B	is it?
A	probably
B	well it's just like the sort of thing you find
A	like a erm
B	in Marks and Spencer's
A	what's that fork that's a cross between a fork and a spoon? a
B	yes I know what you mean
A	spork
B	oh yes it is a spork
A	yeah
B	right because it's chicken
A	mm nice
B	could you please look me out the the er Parmesan?
A	isn't that what you've got?
A	is that Parmesan?
B	you don't have any butter darling
A	oh no look they look like worms
A	yeah
B	serve
B	I've never cooked this dish for you before
A	would you like to turn it down a little bit so we can carry on talking?
B	no let's just relax and watch this
A	oh
