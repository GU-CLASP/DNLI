A	very mature at twenty-two and she wouldn't behave that way
B	oh thank you
A	hi
B	hiya
A	why haven't why aren't I in the beer garden right now?
B	um
C	there's no beverages in the fridge
A	why?
C	apart from wine
B	where's my beer? Did I drink all my er beer?
A	no I think you've got beer left
B	what the hell is that? Is it alive?
A	hm
B	dunno
C	it ain't mine
A	it's not er mine
B	mm
C	I know that much
A	I haven't had beans for a long time
B	bleurgh
A	bleurgh
B	mm
A	huh huh huh huh huh
C	and she said yes cut my hair
B	are you back together?
C	no
B	sour?
C	very very sour
B	I thought er well yesterday I spoke to you and it was civil
C	it's still civil but it's more sour
A	sour grapes
C	er
A	she sounds like a nutter
C	she's just twisted in the head
B	huh?
C	she's not she's just keeping me on a leash and it's doing my head in
B	well don't have it
A	yeah
C	I want my shit first
B	huh?
C	I want my hair cut and my fucking hundred pound jeans and belt that she's got me
B	well you went round to um get all your stuff on Saturday?
C	no
B	right
C	Will she bollocks
B	well why are you going to get presents from her?
A	oh yeah
C	can she?
A	yeah
B	well why would
A	she knows where you live don't she?
C	yeah
B	if you've broken up why would she give you presents?
C	well that's
B	Cos she'd already bought them?
C	yeah
B	seems a bit strange but okay
C	I've got a good mind to tell her just to send them back
A	if it were me I would
B	it would make more sense
C	it is
B	rather than here's a present but we've broken up
C	but they are a nice pair of jeans though
B	I just think it it leads to confusion later on down the line
C	I'm not gonna get done for theft
B	oh no that's not what I mean
A	you owe her one
B	some sort of tie
C	no
A	well I think you might be right with that you know
C	she does a little
A	like do you know any other person that would behave that way?
B	mm
A	like
A	just you know if if they argue over something okay bye
C	yeah
B	well she's er  she's er  it's
C	especially if you want er very
B	that's what I said
C	especially if you wanted a relationship
B	if it was something that mattered to her she wouldn't just walk away
A	yeah
C	I know  I know  I said some hurtful things
A	I think you've hit the nail on the head there
B	mm
A	we saw this when we had the
B	yeah
A	in the house
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and the
B	yeah
A	bond and
B	yeah
A	walking
C	not me
A	girls are
B	typically
A	well no but typically
B	yeah
A	in which case please yourself cos she's not going anywhere
C	mm
A	or secondly she doesn't care for you at all
B	and I mean you've gotta remember that within moments of meeting her she'd said to you I wanna have a a kid
C	mhm
B	and within moments of meeting her
C	mhm
B	she's suddenly miraculously pregnant
A	yeah
B	like I'm not being
C	mm
B	I'm not
C	no I
B	a conspiracy theorist but that that maths doesn't add up does it? Er you just seemed to be right guy a guy right time
C	yeah
B	she's looking
A	yeah
B	she wants to have another kid by the time she's thirty
C	yeah
B	she wants to find someone to father that kid
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so ultimately you've sort of served the purpose I think in her eyes
A	yeah
B	it hasn't worked and er now she's trying to move on to find another baby daddy
A	she sounds like a nut job
B	she doesn't have your best interests at heart
A	certainly not
C	she she she's gonna end up lonely
B	agreed
A	as long as you're not there
B	you need to cut and run while you're not too emotionally attached
C	too late for that I think
B	well you've gotta just
A	so the more time you spend
B	yeah
A	the worse it's gonna get
B	you've just gotta cut er
C	well
B	cut your tie now
C	I'm gonna get my shit
A	you're bloody mental
B	if I were you I would have nothing to do with her
A	no
B	because you're encouraging her by going round there
C	if I
B	it'll end in an argument isn't it
C	but if I  if I  keep her where I want her
B	you can't  you can't
A	but she's not where you want her is she
B	she's gonna carry on messing with your head
A	she's not where you want her now
C	but if I take the stuff then she's more where I want her than when I not when I haven't got it
A	so where is she gonna be then? If you  if you  go and take the stuff then what position do you think what advantageous position do you think that leaves her in?
C	like the whole friendship oh maybe he's changed
B	I don't think you can have a friendship with this person
C	I
B	you you walked into a relationship very quickly
C	yeah
B	there's no actual foundation there because you've only know her for two months
A	mm
B	can you really after everything that's happened the emotional rollercoaster that it's been can you really keep a friendship going? What is there to
C	I I personally at the moment
B	keep keep you friends?
C	if if if she says that she doesn't see any way back then I just wanna cut all ties completely
A	why are you even giving her the choice?
B	well I don't think
A	yeah like why why are you giving her the choice? If she wants to turn back I think you you ought to decide what you want
B	you need to think about your priorities
A	yeah
B	heart on the line
C	pff
B	well then you've gotta be careful then haven't you
C	I fucking burst out crying
B	oh love
C	I was sitting there crying my bloody eyes out
B	yeah
C	try crying
C	could I bollocks?
B	try why would you be trying to cry?
A	stick them on the airer?
B	no
C	I tried putting on the waterworks
A	no
C	and now I just my body wouldn't have it
A	I'm looking for an ice
A	ah
C	can you get the sieve out for me please darling?
B	it's in that one
C	is it?
C	oh yeah
A	I'm looking for an ice pack
B	Don't we have them in the freezer?
C	I mean that's where ice packs should be kept surely?
B	in theory
A	I know
B	in a normal house
A	which has somehow ended up in the back of this cupboard
A	I don't understand why the fuck it's there but
C	oh yeah
A	so we'll freeze this to go on my
B	penis

B	well
A	what?
B	had a panic attack on Saturday
A	oh that's the worst
B	it's only the second time it's happened to me
C	I'd have walked out the front door
B	yeah
C	that's what I'd have done
B	I was just walking round my room
C	yeah
B	and um calmed myself down
A	uh
B	it's really strange
C	just keep that in your head
A	yeah
C	that it's your mum
B	yeah
C	going out with your mum
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	have to go
A	where's this come from?
B	I don't know  I don't know  where it's come from
C	did anyone put you down about anything at all? Knocked you down
C	knocked your confidence
B	tut
A	yeah
B	go out all the time
C	and veg out
C	yeah
B	chill out
C	yeah
B	and I didn't like it
A	yeah
B	so I was like her shadow
C	mm
B	basically
A	yeah yeah
B	and I was like God you're so boring
A	but when you're in that position
B	mm
A	you can't make yourself
B	no
A	have a conversation
C	yeah
A	chatterbox
B	it was really and the more I thought about it the more I was like I just wanna get out of here
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and I didn't like it
A	feel really uncomfortable don't you
B	yeah
A	screwed
B	and so then then it was
A	yeah
B	ten o'clock
A	yeah
B	and the more I thought about it the more I thought I don't wanna go out and be around people actually
C	well it was just for a drink wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	and going out just for a drink is hardly worth it is it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	or I feel a bit on edge
A	mm
B	situations
C	you need a night out in a semi-lively pub I think
A	I think you just need to
B	I think I just
A	force yourself to go out
B	er yeah
A	Cos it's all in your head
B	it's all in my head
A	yeah
B	people that I know that you know aren't gonna judge me
A	yeah
B	even though those people probably aren't judging you
C	what are they judging you on? That's what I don't get
B	well in my head I just think
C	there's nothing wrong with you
B	I just think God you're really you sound really boring
A	yeah
B	or you look a state
A	when I come back from abroad
B	mm
A	and then I got an exact same thing
B	mm
A	and I just didn't go out for so long
B	mm
A	used to go er cos all my friends
C	they've all changed
A	had graduated
B	mm
A	so just
B	mm
A	Cos I'd lived abroad for the year
B	mm
A	that I think I was just a bit up my own arse to be fair
B	mm
A	I left all the talking to her
B	mm
A	all the time
B	yeah
A	Cos we er we knew different friends
B	yeah
A	and I think maybe
B	right
A	I was fine
B	mm
A	until we got in the club
B	mhm
A	so the night's in full swing
B	mm
A	so I fucking ruin everybody's night because everyone's already out
B	mm
A	and then it was that kind of point where you're not quite drunk yet
B	yeah
A	and you're that concerned you can't get to drunk
C	yeah
B	mm
A	so then everybody else is more drunk than you are
B	yeah
A	then you're even more on edge
C	yeah
B	mhm
A	and that you're standing out like a sore thumb
C	that's why I came home early the other night
A	standing round with you know with your arms crossed
B	mm
A	when you're not really trying to do that but then you're really awkward
B	mhm
A	and the only reason it stopped is because my friend
B	mm
A	and I just snapped out of it
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and then after that it just went away completely
B	it is I think about taking you out of your comfort zone
A	yeah
B	settled in the house
C	but you're
B	if I did it more
C	you're maturing as a person though
B	mm
C	you need to  you need to  find your comfort zone as a mature adult
B	well that's what I thought I'd done
C	mm
B	and I don't know what it whether you know whether I'm just feeling my age
A	mm
B	or what
C	it's weird
A	yeah
B	place if you're this age
C	it does seem a bit too youthful doesn't it
A	well there's just a massive gap isn't there
B	yeah
C	mm
B	in their thirties
A	yeah
B	going to the pub
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	everyone moves away
C	yeah
B	no
C	yeah
B	Cos it's supposed to be
C	yeah but then it's
B	that night isn't though
A	yeah
C	mm
A	it's not
B	but um but it there's nothing around it
C	well you've got
C	cocktail bar
B	oh yeah that's true
A	yeah
B	but I must go er there at the wrong time
A	I've only been in there when it's dead
C	yeah you
A	yeah
C	you make the night
A	I think
B	mm
A	er
C	mm
A	it was empty
B	mm
A	or Chelmsford or somewhere where I can get
B	yeah
A	eight pound a night it's cheaper than a taxi
B	oh yeah we could stay in the hotel
A	yeah
B	we should do that
A	er just choose a place and go there
B	mm
A	Peterborough's hardly far
C	yeah

C	yeah
A	it's an extra five grand
C	to be fair
A	if I
B	oh hell no
A	yeah
B	I couldn't imagine it'd be worse
A	I'm not going on it
C	yeah but you're down there for months

B	mm
A	so I don't know what I get
B	er well at least you know it's gonna be better than that

A	with a nice waist belt going on so
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	nice
A	and they were in the sale for fifty-five pounds
B	they're probably fine
A	they are patent
B	well it's not me you've gotta convince love
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	apart from that
A	I think they're gonna make me wear the navy boots to be fair
B	mm
C	they will  they will
B	maybe you could add a wedge to the boot
A	mm
C	they'd all have to be capped as well
A	huh
C	they'd all er have to be capped
A	fff
C	no one
C	oh yes
A	oh no if war comes I'll be like no hang on I'm just getting my shoes off
A	I don't want them er to get ruined
C	mind you
A	yeah
B	yeah but that still means you will be in a war
C	yeah but you will have time to prepare
B	oh I dunno
C	you will have time to get
A	huh
C	yeah
A	do they make me use their shampoo?
C	probably
B	no
A	I think I'm gonna have to ask these things
B	mm
A	do you think?
B	give it a go
C	but you wanna be unfeminine about it
A	I've got bleached blonde hair and I go on the sunbed
C	yeah I know
A	you see I disagree with this
B	I er think femininity's fine
A	I think so
C	yeah?
B	you are a woman
A	as long as I don't complain too much
B	I think you've you've er gotta give a hundred percent
A	yeah
B	but there are gonna be differences
C	have you got over your spider
A	no
C	phobia yet? You need to  you need to  do that
A	I'm in a ship full of men
B	yeah but the problem is if you're in a room full of ratings and you freak out about a spider
A	huh
B	you'll probably
C	yeah
B	it's probably not a good move is it? Like
A	mm
C	you need to get over your fear
B	you're gonna just have to just gonna have to leave the room
A	yeah
B	and try not to scream
A	yeah
C	just just YouTube spiders
A	no
C	you don't need
A	can't even look at them on a screen
C	um seriously do it
B	you don't have a fear?
C	I have a fear of vertical drops
B	Don't watch Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol then
B	they
C	yeah
B	and he er is running up and down it like a monkey with these ridiculous gloves obviously that don't exist that make you stick to buildings
C	yeah
A	huh
B	and one of the gloves falls off
B	was actually hanging out of the side of the building
C	you see there's there's a
B	is it not the same thing?
C	well I'm not afraid of heights
A	no cos I'm scared of heights but I don't get vertigo
B	really?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	whereas I'm scared of heights
B	yeah
A	but it doesn't make me dizzy
B	oh okay
C	yeah
A	mm
C	you see I I I I can look out
B	mm
C	I can look directly down only if there's something that I can hold onto
B	mm
C	if there's nothing there there is no way that you are getting me standing on that edge and looking directly down
B	mm
C	Cos I will shit myself
B	so bungee jumping is out?
C	oh yeah
A	I think it's something to do with your balance isn't it? Well I
B	tut yeah
A	because her balance is really affected
B	tut oh God
A	and get it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's her centre of gravity isn't it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but yeah that's a bit weird
B	curiouser and curiouser
A	if it maybe it's the same thing
C	Cos I I I even get shit scared on a scaffold
B	mm
C	and I go on a wobble
B	mm
C	regardless of how high I am
A	it scares everyone though
C	yeah
A	really goes
B	yeah
C	it's a falling feeling
B	mm
C	even in dreams
B	yeah
C	you know
A	do you know they say if you hit the floor you're dead? Did you know that?
C	er
A	no in real life
C	what happens when you wake up?
A	no that's why you wake up
A	it's er it's the same type of thing as a heart attack
B	right
A	so when you're asleep and you're dreaming that you're falling
B	mm
A	the way your heart reacts is like it would for a heart attack
B	oh right
A	yeah
C	I'm having a dream tonight
A	yeah
C	in all
A	unless they've all been lying
C	in all fairness it does sound kinda true
B	hm
A	I mean I am quite gullible so maybe it is a lie
C	but you can wake up and your heart like
A	yeah
C	so you you can imagine it being quite true
A	might've been had
B	sounds like it could be
A	mm
B	mm
A	I think I want to know what time the swimming is tomorrow
B	swimming
A	swimming
A	er he's back from Afghanistan tomorrow
B	that's a short tour
A	oh no last November
A	or something like that
B	oh I can
A	he last the last holiday last November
B	oh right
A	so he had two weeks off in November
B	so he's back
A	in er
B	mm
A	I don't know if he's at barracks there or if he lives at home there
B	yeah
A	he does have a home there
B	right
A	um
B	what is it with you and babies?
A	twenty-two
B	there have been quite a few younger men
A	no
B	Cos
B	he was twenty young
A	yes
A	and that's another thing
A	yep
B	whatever
A	I'd forgotten about that
B	oh my mate he's a chef
A	I am the top
B	hilarious
A	yes
B	the child
B	bless him
B	he was young
A	yeah
B	you must've got a motherly look about you
A	oh God
A	oh Jesus
A	that's bad ain't it
B	no
A	never
B	no no no no
A	that's what I hate actually is that the only thing you're going on on these things is like the physical attraction of someone
B	mm
A	Cos you don't get to really know them from a few messages
B	no
A	like I think Matt was a bit of a anomaly
B	mm
A	what you were saying to me then I completely get
B	yeah yeah
A	whereas as at the time I was like no that's that's definitely him
B	mm
A	whereas now I completely see what you mean
B	mm
A	like you just haven't got a a chance at all gauging that with someone
B	it's just a risk
A	yeah
B	and worst case scenario you don't meet them for a second
A	do a runner
B	that you do a runner in the toilets
B	through the window
A	out of the toilet window
B	I would quite like to do that
A	in my life
B	but I think I would be
A	yeah
B	Cos imagine is that was you
A	huh
B	and they just
B	you would probably kill yourself
A	yeah
B	well they're children
A	yeah
B	this is their first foray into romance
A	they don't take the criticism very well
B	mm
C	yeah
B	what time is she expecting you?
C	quarter past eight
B	quarter past eight?
C	mm
B	oh is that when the kids are in bed?
C	yeah
B	got what?
C	brownies
A	oh I thought you said rounders
B	rounders
A	yeah
B	it's out of season
A	oh
B	I don't er I don't doubt it for a moment
B	were you trying to persuade the other kids that Jesus didn't exist?
A	yeah
A	you horrible child
B	oh really?
A	I was genuinely concerned
A	and I was asking them
B	aw
A	but why? If this is er the oldest in time are there no dinosaurs?
B	oh that's really funny
A	it just doesn't make sense
B	so instead of you know addressing your concerns they just kicked you out?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um cos I also wasn't very happy that I'd not been picked to be Sunday school queen
B	oh I've no idea
A	yeah
B	fine
A	either way
B	yeah
B	aw
A	and so
B	and you were very upset?
A	yeah
B	right
A	all in all
B	mm
A	er
B	oh
A	and then that was that
A	goodbye
B	goodbye baby Jeebus
A	bye baby dubious
A	goodbye baby dubious
A	to your Christian life
B	no one gives a fuck about you
A	fat chance
B	see you later
B	it's been fun
A	that
B	urgh

B	um
A	and that's the end of the packet that I have as well
B	okay
B	bleurgh bleurgh bleurgh
C	suppose I ought to put some smelly on ain't I really

A	no
B	as in closing down?

A	well that that tells you how much weight I've put on in my life that when I first went to uni
B	yeah
A	and we I used to get stopped all the time
B	fern Cotton?
A	so this
A	can you imagine how much thinner it must have been to have looked as thin as her face?

B	you're gonna have a baby
A	I love them
B	he's fucking mental isn't he
A	yes
B	because he loves the drama
A	he actually does love it
B	I mean he did say to me with a straight face that she was five and a half weeks pregnant
A	she was just late for a period
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I said how many times in your life you won't know this but a girl will be late for the period pretty much odds on every other time
B	mm
A	because if you're just excuse me worrying about one thing
B	yeah
A	gone
B	er
A	and then you worry even more cos it's not there
B	unless you're even er unless you are regular as clockwork which I very much doubt she is er having had two babies and a miscarriage
A	yeah
B	that we she says she's had a miscarriage
A	no
B	I mean er I was talking to my mum about it and she was saying you could say
B	cos er
B	Cos I was trying to understand it
A	no
B	there is no cells
A	yeah
B	so you couldn't ever say it was pregnancy
A	but the only way it would be considered to be an early miscarriage would if you were sure you were pregnant before
B	she wasn't sure
A	yeah
B	yeah that's that's classic
A	yep
B	did she
A	mm
B	I hope I assume she hasn't
A	I assume her friends dobbed her in
B	that's fucking mental
B	you've got issues and shouldn't be allowed to keep your child
A	the monkey mask?
B	I don't like it
A	I er found her on Facebook you know
A	yeah
B	I've seen her
A	oh yeah
B	in passing
A	tut
B	I've no I've
A	huh
B	oh you were telling me this

A	text
B	is she wearing
A	is she wearing?
B	an Elizabeth Duke clown necklace?
A	clown
B	oh probably
A	doll's with pigtails
B	oh I think they were like female clowns or
B	it was
A	why do people do that?
B	she's your girlfriend
A	yes
B	what is that hair? And why why has she got such a massive spam? She looks like a clown
A	you'd cover that up
B	I dunno if it's the eyebrows as well aren't really helping
A	I saw a girl today
B	what was it like?
A	I mean I can't really say er cos it must've been naturally it can't have been naturally that way
B	mm
A	but the this curl must've been about that wide
B	mm
A	so and it dropped
B	urgh
A	in perfect loads of curls
B	yeah
A	like worms
B	bleurgh
A	like worms
B	mm
A	really thin and really long
B	it's pretty grim
A	she must've chosen to do that
B	she must've chosen
A	she chose that on herself
B	chosen that head
A	she looked like Medusa
B	she's mental
A	yep
B	yeah
A	well do you know
B	oh
A	I know
B	the sex spy must have kids? What?
A	what?
B	where do all the single mummies go to find love? Sex spy knows
B	as
A	that's a roast chicken
B	is it?
A	you need your eyes testing mate
B	does that really look like a chicken to you?
A	hm
A	it's questionable
B	I mean what's what's that?
A	I think it must be stuffed with some type of death
A	that's really distasteful when you read it
B	where is
A	that's the
A	Brr brrp
B	what's that?
A	that's the breast up there
A	that's the chicken thigh
B	deadly lunch
A	deadly lunch
B	huh
A	how bad?
B	he was crying when he told me
A	huh
B	it's really bad
A	yeah
B	and I'm really chuffed that you wanted to hang out again
A	sh
A	no
A	please continue
B	oh
A	of course
B	and er he's like we have to go to the I said we could go to The Empress for a pint
A	yeah
B	I was okay fine
A	right
B	okay fine let's hear the story
A	fuck
B	two and a half years
A	fuck
B	I was just like you
A	two and a half years
B	and I was like did you kill someone? And he said no but I thought I did
A	A bang
B	um a noise or
A	no
B	so he left the person there
A	shit
B	thinking oh I've killed them
A	torch the car?
B	and I was like what the fuck? It gets worse
A	huh
B	says to
A	are you being serious?
B	yeah
A	holy fucking shit
A	how can you not?
B	at the time I was in the pub I was driving
A	did they kill him?
B	no
A	and they didn't kill the passenger?
B	no
A	jeez
B	and then got out after two and a half years
A	do you know the worst thing is had he have stopped and helped that guy
B	mm
A	he wouldn't have got told off for it
B	mm
A	unless they could've proved he'd er drinking
B	convicted of reckless yeah
A	then he can't get done for reckless driving
B	mm
A	the only way you can get done for reckless driving is if they know that over an extended period of drive either you know you were veering all over the road
B	mm
A	you went through lights
B	mm
A	whereas if you just drive and lapse of judgement and hit someone
B	mm
A	you can't get done for it
B	really?
A	you might get a fine
B	mm
A	if you are pulling out of a driveway and knock someone dead
B	mm
A	you can't get done for reckless driving
B	God
A	panicked
B	er didn't know what to do
A	and
B	on his own I think he probably would've stopped
A	yeah
B	Cos he wouldn't have known what else to do
A	someone else saying do this
B	or but er yeah
A	huh
B	he was on a wing with paedophiles
A	what something they've helped him with or something?
B	yeah
A	I don't yeah
B	it's like a sort of they come round and check on you
A	oh
B	um er what landlord would say you can't have kids round? And er now I realize why
A	frig
B	and when he came out of prison the first like originally he was living with paedophiles
A	yeah
B	like er it would be for a man or a woman or
A	yeah
B	man and man
A	yeah
B	I'm not saying you know
A	that's like us
B	feel sorry for them but
A	that's like someone saying to us you can't have sex with a man
B	mm
A	you're only allowed to have sex with women
B	mm
A	only ever
B	exactly
A	huh
B	such a long time of your life
A	is that why he broke up with his wife then? His girlfriend whatever
B	no they no that was on the cards for a long time apparently
A	wowsers
B	but like obviously he was telling me he was finishing off the story when we were in the pub and he's like er I'm really surprised you're still here
A	yeah
B	so much information
A	yeah
B	and he  and he  obviously does
A	yeah
B	but it's still I mean er
A	yeah
B	and he just left them
A	I
B	absolutely
A	it's that fight or flight thing isn't it
B	yeah
A	that you wouldn't probably get a choice
B	no
A	like I'd say there's no way I could drive away from that
B	yeah
A	no matter how much trouble I would get in
B	yeah
A	but you never know
B	you don't know until you're in it
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	especially cos he's got a screw loose anyway
B	mm
A	in the nicest possible way
B	or or or five
A	you know what I mean
B	it's really
B	really hard
A	can you imagine how awful that must have been
B	mm
A	in prison for that amount of time
B	yeah
A	with those weirdos?
B	awful
A	yeah
B	two and a half years? Which er must be
A	the guy that knocked my dad off and nearly killed him
B	mm
A	nada
B	really? Shit
A	like we were told he was gonna die like three times
B	yeah
A	nada
B	shit
A	that's what I was saying to you
B	mm
A	well he was but
B	mm
A	he was only pulling out of the drive
B	mm
A	nada
B	tut
A	that's what I mean
B	he must've been er
A	a bad hand there
B	yeah
A	because usually they need proof that it's a prolonged
B	well I think he must've been in trouble before
A	ah
B	they would probably put you in prison
A	yeah maybe
B	er he said he'd had a colourful past when he was a child
A	yeah
B	when he was like a teenager so
A	you're talking like breaking and entering or something or
B	he must've done something or like
A	petty drugs or something
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	because for your first offence for them to give you two and a half years in prison
A	so that's why the guy that lives next door smoking the legal high stuff
B	mm
A	cos he can't he won't be able to get caught
B	yeah
A	with pot in the house
B	yeah
A	where is this then?
B	did he
A	no
B	an ambulance was turning up for him
A	huh
B	yeah
A	shit
B	yeah
A	they were saying actually on the news that the legal highs are more lethal
B	yeah
A	yep
B	because they're seen to be legal
A	yep
A	fricking hell
B	it's like they're in the room
B	mm
A	like it is a  it is a  plant
B	mm
A	it is actually grass
B	yeah
A	there's at least there's no additive to it
B	mm
A	there's no extra crap
B	yeah
A	they're not cutting it with rat poison
B	no
A	well
B	urgh
A	you wouldn't trust those bastards
B	but essentially it's not chemical
A	okay for no
B	in the sense that pills are
A	legal for us to have chemical alcohol
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	some nice
A	that makes entire sense
B	nice taxable drug
A	yeah
B	I know  I know  And I
A	I have to close that door
B	well I might er put the kettle on and get Guinness cake if you
A	huh
B	if I can tempt you
A	Guinness cake
B	here
A	oh it's so wild man
B	so mad
A	huh
B	oh a light
A	charger?
B	yep
A	I've been putting music onto here to use this to put on the iPod
B	oh yeah?
A	on
B	mm mm mm
A	I don't think the days of all the cake I had on Friday have er did I tell you on Friday at work I had three slices of cake?
B	nice
A	mm
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	who the fuck's
A	no
B	oh do you like it?
A	mm
B	oh thanks love
A	did you make this on the top?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	all of the good things
A	all of the good things
B	er it needs slightly less time in the oven
A	to be precise
B	yeah
A	I would like to be a baker
B	it's surprisingly easy
A	mm
B	just gotta shove everything in a pan
B	I don't know if that is the answer
A	I mean when I I witnessed the making of this
B	I think that's because it was first thing in the morning and I was
B	going what? What? What? It cos the instructions aren't clear
A	what's that? What's folding in?
B	oh you like not whisk it in
A	mm
B	stick
A	mm
B	you've got to make sure it's the right quantity of flour
A	fucks it
B	yeah
A	well
B	but fine
A	this is another prime example of the bakers not telling us what to do properly
B	bakers assuming too much knowledge
A	please
B	so yes um re the
A	God
B	it was all a bit weird
A	I don't suppose he's told many people
B	he hasn't really
A	I bet he's been really worried about telling you you know
B	well probably
A	yeah
B	because any girl's gonna go
A	no
B	like that's interesting
A	mm
B	it's only
A	yeah but not just that
B	mm
A	or or my mum's a crazy person
B	mhm
A	even if it was something as little as that
B	mm
B	yeah
A	you just things like that you don't say initially
B	mm
A	for that ever to come up
B	mm
A	jeebus
B	so um so yeah
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I only know
B	mm
A	mm
A	that was my initial thought
B	no I think he does love me
A	do you think?
B	mm
A	mm
B	but then because he doesn't he's he's really sweet and really affectionate and really nice
A	mm
B	which is nice
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but um but then
B	like there is no quality control over what comes out that boy's mouth
B	at all
B	I said er oh this is really nice
A	actually no I can't be bothered
B	we were lying in bed and he was like I'm gonna go to the shop cos I'm gonna get you breakfast
A	please tell me there's chocolate in here and I'm not going crazy
B	no there is chocolate in here
A	okay
B	Guinness and chocolate
A	mm
B	not a potential boyfriend
A	mm mm
B	because he's a complete nightmare
A	mhm
B	but he's he is interesting to have around
A	yeah he's a nice person
B	I think that's the thing
A	mm
B	his past
A	actually he's
B	it was a bad thing that happened to him
A	yeah
A	it wasn't done with intent
B	no
A	he then continued the story to say yes I then
B	went and killed the guy
A	went and killed a man
B	I mean I didn't ask if he thought about doing it
A	mm
B	I mean he said that was
A	probably wise
B	yeah
A	mm
B	just don't need to know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	completely different
B	mm
A	for that length of time
B	mm
A	you must just see so many types of creep
B	mm
A	and especially if you know he's been put in there for a bad decision
B	mm
A	they've been put in there because they intentionally did something
B	Cos they're bad people
A	yeah
B	would be really really hard
A	I don't think I could hack it
B	no
A	cos my friends always joke cos I've got away with so many things before
B	really?
A	mm
B	what?
B	where was your passport?
A	in Lyon
B	mm
A	I
B	how had you got into Switzerland then?
A	I'd got on the train from Lyon to Geneva to pick
B	right
A	and that was the closest airport really
B	mm
A	it was loads loads more expensive
B	mm
A	Cos it's like a third or quarter of the price um to fly to Geneva
B	yeah
A	go to meet him off the plane and realized I'm meeting him off an aeroplane
A	all the signs aren't in French anymore and I don't have any Swiss francs
A	I was like oh
B	so what language
A	but
B	were you speaking at this point then? German?
A	well they must've been
A	I don't speak German
A	Cos then er he cos he speaks German
A	to A-level standard
B	yeah
A	which is a bear bug
A	so he can understand it
B	mm
A	I then I clicked
A	hm
B	oh
A	fuck
B	but they hadn't checked on the train?
A	I'd been asleep
A	I was sat with my ticket in my hand
B	mm
A	my train ticket and just gone oh well you know
B	Good
A	then confessed that I was an illegal immigrant in Geneva
A	and then realized that with the best will in the world
B	oh my God
A	so even if he could get there with my key and somehow find my passport
B	yeah
B	mm mm
A	so I said do you know what? We'll just get on the train again
A	archway the size of this room saying passport control to France
B	mm
A	when I have to ring uni for them to come bail me
A	when I get arrested by one of these four men with massive military guns
B	mm
A	er scary
A	and he was like fuck
B	really?
A	so like right we need a plan here
A	and we're getting closer and closer
A	he was like this is it
A	this is it now
A	and I was like no
A	he's like it is
B	mm
A	she's gonna witness it too
A	so that's even worse
B	mm
B	matching backpacks
A	got matching backpacks
A	british
A	through all the Japanese tourists
B	shit
B	that's so bad
A	there was four of them
B	and they let you through?
A	yeah
B	shit
A	yeah
B	my God
A	yeah
B	you'd be even in even more trouble
A	I would've been in even more trouble
B	yeah
B	and that I
A	yeah
B	might need my passport
A	yeah
B	wow
A	that when I get caught for
B	yeah
A	whatever it is I get in trouble for it's gonna be something like that
B	it's er every time you get away with it it's adding it's getting bigger
A	my karma
B	mm
A	my karma's massive now
B	oh huh
A	yep
B	yeah well you've been doing that quite recently haven't you
A	mm
B	have you been in Vodka Revolution recently?
A	mm
B	yeah and not yeah not paying
A	not paying for taxis
B	well
A	handing in coursework late
B	really?
A	mm
B	mm
A	sending it in Word that she can't open
B	to get a bit more time?
A	knowing it to buy me an extra week
B	I suppose that's it
A	I owe the French government six hundred pounds
B	Good
A	can't fly back there for a while
B	yeah my friend's like that with Greece
B	she didn't pay some sort of tax at the airport and she can't go back in the country
B	so that's  so that's  interesting
A	mhm
B	she's not allowed to go back to Greece
A	well yeah
B	oh right
A	spending it
B	oh nice
A	so they'd given me a hundred Euros a month to go towards my five hundred Euro rent
A	living here it doesn't seem so bad now but at the time living in Hull going from two hundred and fifty a month to five hundred a month
B	mm
A	I was like what the fuck?
B	mm
A	um so yeah
B	mm
A	I'd filled out all my paperwork to say I was only staying for six months
B	oh that's funny that they er they give you money though
A	french university
B	yeah but you're is that not um just an exchange thing? I mean you're technically a student of Hull University
A	yeah but for that semester I'm not
B	oh er so you they were accountable for you
A	mm
B	for that year? Oh that's interesting
A	like I have my student card from there still
B	oh okay
A	so like you enroll there and the English university gives them money for my
B	mm
A	university fees
B	yeah
A	it goes to France
B	oh okay
A	and theirs come to us but my if I got my transcript for my degree which by the way did you have to send off for that? Cos I definitely don't have one
B	you have to send off for it
A	ah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you give your certificate to your mum and dad because that's what they're there for
A	mm
B	or whoever
A	yeah
B	having a transcript
A	mm
B	a running total every year
A	no
B	oh okay
A	and the second half of it well it wouldn't be Italian cos I didn't go
B	La la la
A	yeah
B	mm
A	at least I can prove that I was there
B	okay
A	Cos you only have to prove that you're there and studying
B	you don't have to send coursework or anything?
A	pass the exams
B	oh okay
A	so they set coursework and I have to send it back every few weeks
B	oh right
A	but as long as I can prove that I'm there that's the kind of prerequisite of the course
B	oh
A	you have to either have an employment contract
B	mm
A	there's no way of tracing that though so they'll believe me
B	really?
B	aw
B	to get in  to get in  oh I see
A	like they knew he was coming
B	yeah
A	they had his name down on the list
B	Italy's hilarious though isn't it
A	tutor open all the time?
B	no
A	no
B	yeah
A	mine wasn't
B	oh yeah
A	this is the enrolment office though
B	oh right
A	admissions office
B	oh
A	one hour every
B	fuck
A	and by the time you got there there were so many hundreds of students queuing
B	no chance
A	no chance
B	I mean er our and our office was always busy
A	mm
B	you know
A	I never saw mine you know
B	complete joke
A	no
B	Peter
A	so er in fact the only ever conversation I had with her is because she was also the French marker for the for set coursework that was sent back while we were abroad
B	tut
A	and what happened was we got about five pieces over over the year
B	mm
A	and then progressively got to the last one was three thousand words in the opposite language
B	oh okay
A	so no English
B	oh okay
A	so the English got shorter and the target language got bigger
B	mm
A	which didn't really make sense if you did more than one language
A	but she
B	mm
A	to up your mark
B	mm
A	I got mine back the day before the second one was due in
B	mm
A	there's no reading and improving on that
B	Good
A	mm
B	you don't really have a lot of luck do you
A	no
B	with admin folk of schooling establishments?
A	nope
B	it turns out
A	I've always had er really bad luck with them
B	well it's probably that they are all cretins
A	what?
B	no lie
B	they just threw them on the floor and just had a party
A	mm
B	and like before midday
A	I never had that
B	no well we
B	in terms of whether it punched anything
B	sense or support from
B	because they basically hated the students
A	really?
B	hilarious about people who work er in in education
A	oh no I remember
A	could be
B	oh my God
A	so that you couldn't hand your work in
B	yeah
A	so therefore they knew if it was late and it was time
B	yeah
A	and
A	belting down that corridor
A	from the
A	fricking hurry up
A	running down the corridor
A	it's just
B	huh
A	yeah I really was
B	oh God is she still there?
