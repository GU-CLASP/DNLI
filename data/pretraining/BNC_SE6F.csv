B	yeah but I can't remember
A	oh this is the tutorial
A	oh we don't wanna play this but yeah okay
B	oh yeah I probably don't need to be quite this basic
A	this yeah
B	can I
A	press escape

B	have I have I earned any points yet? or what are they called?
A	I er influence points
B	influence points

A	she was impressed oh how did you do the radiator? I took it off she was like you drained it and everything? and I could've gone with that story of yeah I I drained it you know
B	is this working?
A	I don't have a clue I don't think so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	battle training?
A	mm wait there wait there wait there but you could do lots of people against the computer so you can get other people
B	okay
A	okay so do co-op versus AI erm
B	yeah that one?
A	so just so
B	match me?
A	yeah yeah and just wait a five-minute wait
B	and I imagine as well there's very few people that are playing on intro
A	yeah
A	oh so this is the normal process
B	yeah I don't think I've done this bit before
A	no no you haven't you've only done
B	yeah
A	boom boom boom boom
B	that one?
A	you've played her before but shall we do top right then just to mix it up a little bit? yeah
B	so what do I do here?
A	right okay well you don't have any runes yet cos you're level one
B	okay
A	but if you go to masteries and you click on the little pen
B	mm okay what's a mastery page?
A	but
B	okay
A	and on that on that page you can you can put it on something
B	okay
A	and each of these
B	okay
A	so oh actually yeah so if you wanna have
B	okay
B	okay
A	have erm attack speed just cos
B	okay
A	and then click save masteries
B	yeah
A	more offence or utility
B	what's utility?
A	utility is
B	oh shit I probably
A	doesn't you don't have to lock in
B	oh what's the countdown mean?
A	I dunno
B	took my Rengar
A	oh the champion below you there
B	oh yeah
A	up yeah that's a Rengar
B	oh
A	yeah erm
B	yeah
A	yeah erm playing on er UK servers should be like less than thirty
B	that's great
A	but it's
B	mm
A	these are a really slow computers actually
A	erm definitely think a laptop should've been on our list a bit higher don't you?
B	yeah but it's Christmas soon
A	oh yeah erm that Tesco's thing through the door had some price match on like Hudls
B	I don't know oh I guess you'd have to like have a look
A	look at them
B	review online I suppose
A	cos just to read stuff it might be worth it erm or then again a Kindle as opposed to an actual Ipad
B	yeah
A	can you still watch things on Kindles?
B	yeah er you know the Kindle Fire?
A	the Fire
B	yeah I think it's still cheaper than an Ipad but it works as a Kindle and as an Ipad type thing
A	so you have two settings?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	okay
A	okay right
B	yes
A	you can press P but yeah
A	oh right right erm okay what I would do is I'd either go top that top one or I'd start a long sword
B	that one
A	and get
B	I can't really remember how to make
A	use the map it's right-click right-click use the map
B	oh right-click I don't know why but it feels like counter-intuitive to right-click
A	I know
B	I don't know what what are you asking me to do? sorry
A	your
B	oh right
A	yeah okay right now get your fingers on Q W and E
B	wow
A	fuck attack something yeah just attack something
B	like
A	okay okay okay
B	you're confusing me
B	okay
A	yeah er if I'm not playing erm I can't work it out in my head yeah yeah
B	right-click? Right-click
A	yeah
B	oh that's horrible
B	well
A	just back away back away just back away back away back away back away
B	I'm not er I'm not that dead am I?
A	oh my god that's so fucking annoying
B	is it painful to watch?
A	yeah just hit them just hit you can see they're dying
B	and where do I go?
A	you've gotta run away a bit so you're safe and press B to go back
B	yeah but I'm five for none oh no my team is
A	your team is you're one for none
A	we'll level that right press P
B	right
A	go back to recommended
B	oh I've got loads of gold
A	okay what we're gonna do is
B	yes
A	oh we should've waited a little bit we want a hundred gold
B	I've got a hundred gold
A	no we want a hundred more gold
B	er oh what do I want?
A	you want that
B	this?
A	down down
B	that?
A	that we want that
B	the the BF sword what does that stand for?
A	I can only imagine that stands for big fucking sword
A	bloody
B	oh
A	and er you got like ten
B	I think I'd have preferred a giant
A	have you ever seen BFG?
B	yes it's quite creepy actually
A	yes it's really creepy
B	but then a lot of Roald Dahl's
A	double-click okay and press escape you wanna go back to the middle just go there yeah
B	is that me?
A	yeah they've all  shit little sayings
B	my work is not done
A	no one stop me
B	so I'm getting a little bit confused I
A	yeah
B	left-click for the little minions
A	no you right-click
B	but right-click
A	you right-click attack everything
B	oh
A	you left-click just your ability so hold R now hold R and then point it at him and then left-click and now use all your other abilities so your E
B	oh
A	and your E your E
A	good shit
B	mm
A	they're all available
B	what? how?
A	keep levelling them
B	oh just what?
A	erm oh er run away he he he yeah he could kill you so go in these bushes and then again we've gotta press back annoyingly so go back just er don't have to hold it
B	which is what? that?
B	this one?
A	erm
B	erm yeah I
A	every single like well I I've got there now but I don't know which champion beats which champion I don't know what's a fair match or
B	mm
A	but yeah that the
B	what? er how did I use my Ult?
A	or your Ultimate's erm
B	yes enough
A	and you've got barely any mana
B	so they can presumably shoot at you the whole time you're like doing this?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	I'll show you I'll show you what you should
B	er what does W do? it doesn't seem to do much
A	oh just
B	er
A	okay right so I'll tell you what it means hover over it
B	okay
A	so
B	yeah what?
A	okay er applies blight for six seconds stacked three times so your your other abilities
B	I tried to
A	I know I know you tried
B	I was probably pressing the wrong button
A	okay yeah you can use your abilities your E and your
B	I get confused which button I'm meant to press to be honest
A	it's right and click to attack stuff left-click to use your abilities so run away run away run away
B	er I don't what is my Ult? stop saying my Ultimate I don't
A	R R yeah there and then E
B	yeah like there's no point shouting that at me when I don't know what it means
B	would I?
A	you can level up
B	oh
A	you could've
B	okay
A	press P purchaser okay erm we'll go for some attack speed
B	which is what?
B	that one?
A	yeah we'll go for that one and then the bottom right one yeah
B	yeah him
A	er we're gonna kill him
B	okay so can I use them all
A	yes
B	okay
A	they've got their own timers
B	okay
A	I'll I'll show you after we've killed this guy okay are you ready for him?
B	oh I keep pressing the wrong fucking button
A	that's alright it's alright now run over there right-click on there on the on the map
B	mm
A	so
B	okay
A	but it's hard enough
B	yeah
A	erm yeah you got a lot of gold
B	yes
A	last you don't get the gold erm er kill these ones and then we'll I'll take you somewhere else but yeah okay click er
B	where?
A	right click there yeah
B	it's a dragon
A	okay right-click there
B	there?
A	yeah
B	what does
A	it's this blue bar at the bottom you've got you need mana to use your abilities sorry yeah
B	oh okay yeah
A	it's on the shelf there
A	okay
B	you shout words at me
A	press press back yeah
B	do you have a preference to where I go?
A	I'd just go straight to their base and we'll finish the game
B	wahoo
A	happy with that?
B	yeah they've said I've won that's good
A	yeah that's good
A	I wanna er
B	I definitely get confused between
A	just to show you technique
B	my left and right-click
A	left and right-click
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and I I didn't I don't know what mana is so
B	yeah
A	and let's say an ability takes
B	oh I assumed it had to recharge after every go
A	no
B	oh okay
A	but each each ability has a timer but it still has a mana cost
B	you wanna show me how it's done?
A	well not show you how it's done as such yeah maybe a little bit
B	it's gonna take time you weren't amazing on your first go either and you had a lot of like gaming experience
A	how do you know if I wasn't amazing on my first go?
B	cos you're not amazing now
A	well I'm better than you so
B	well clearly
A	yeah clearly
B	not particularly difficult as I've just proven
A	mate you should see them on
A	erm yeah
B	there's just a lot er if I think I'd be okay if there
A	yeah
B	but there's just so much it's like it's not just like all the different things it's this mana and it's it's buying stuff and it's it's there's like ten different things you can be killing and they all die differently and like
A	I've told you about that game Rakion Chaos Force haven't I?
B	the what?
B	yeah
A	if you were the archer on that you were actually you could aim like through her head if that makes sense? good really good
B	real good
A	these people are on really slow computers
B	well so are we
B	why does everybody say GG at the end of the game?
A	it stands for good game
B	well I know what it stands for but is it necessary?
A	yeah it's always necessary
B	do you do WP?
A	what's WP?

A	wrong person
A	good girl
B	oh no
A	what?

A	well you didn't use it last time anyway
B	my work is not done
A	I hate sharing lanes
B	you what?
A	sharing lanes with someone
A	erm Saturday I think
B	yeah don't think we're doing anything
A	the minions take a while to spawn
A	well during the well they haven't spawned yet on a pro game what would happen is they would go through the jungle and lay a load of wards so they could see which
B	yeah
A	right just
B	I haven't got it yet
A	don't waste your abilities
B	okay
A	cos obviously you can see how much mana you've used already?
B	yeah
A	it's like a hundred and fifty
B	is there a quicker way to? or do you have to? hold on
A	alright happy with that?
B	what? you're not saying anything
A	no no I was just just trying to watch you and see if you knew what you were doing
A	little bit little bit of panic in there
A	not much

B	mm
A	oh shit
B	okay what? oh I'm red does that mean I'm low health?
A	yeah yeah you need you need to erm
B	it's probably really stupid to do that right there isn't it?
A	you can move
A	er why are you? yeah
A	yeah that's better there
B	I knew as soon as I'd done it
A	I think so yeah
B	to say yes then
A	er right right we'll get the first up
B	that one?
A	yeah and then we'll get another BF sword just gotta wait
A	alright
B	what? the mana situation?
A	yeah this mana's just a joke on this guy
B	how exciting
A	well we'll try
B	we're going in a oh
A	that's the erm the river
B	it's exciting I didn't know you could walk across that
A	there he is
B	oh too late sorry
A	just yeah it's got a hundred and nine second cool down on it
B	well
B	you probably perhaps should've told me that before I did it
B	I don't know what I was aiming at there to be honest
A	no nor do I that's alright
B	what did you just press?
A	just just keep on them
B	what the hell is that thing?
A	erm you see your D and your F?
B	yeah
A	your F is heal and your D is ghost which means you run quicker
B	okay
A	I just didn't wanna tell you about that cos it just
B	extra shit
A	it adds it just adds more but every so often if I
A	oh my god
B	there's so many buttons
B	and I've got
A	P P
B	I've got just a crazy amount of gold as well what the
A	okay we'll get
B	fun shit can I buy?
A	we'll get that one okay
B	yeah but it's fucking fun
A	good stuff
B	where's the dragon?
A	the dragon's there
B	where's red buff?
A	red buff is there there's two on each map there's that's our that's our blue and our red
B	oh right
A	that's their red and their blue well in theory when you join the game erm but the red buff I think it I think it gives you a bit of a healing ability I can't remember what and er the
B	is this him then?
A	yeah yeah yeah it mm er yeah the one with the red circle around him use your E
B	where's the dragon? here?
A	it's er yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	I think it leaves a bit of fire on them and just does a little bit of extra damage
B	I'm not gonna be in near anyone to use it
A	no
B	I didn't mean to use it I thought I'd changed it oh you have to press escape do you?
A	yeah
B	what do you mean charging?
B	yeah
A	it's got a certain it's got a max range it can be
B	yeah
A	when you first start it starts
B	ah
A	the the further away your arrow can go yeah you see it?
B	mm
A	your double buff
A	kill these fuckers
B	okay
A	you're just so strong
B	I just panic
A	I know I'd back cos you've got so much gold three thousand four hundred gold you've got eighteen kills with no deaths there's been thirteen deaths so these idiots you're playing with have managed to die between them
A	you've got almost half of your kills
B	I've got the advantage
A	okay I'd go I'd go bottom left
B	this one?
A	to be honest yeah
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	and that is utterly terrible
A	we'll push
B	okay
A	it's the easiest thing for you to learn just that's that's basically half the game will be in lane until you know those outer turrets that you kill right at the start?
B	I don't know what to tap
B	oh
A	yeah
A	okay can you see there's still red down here? so we'll go down and get them
B	what the fuck?
A	yep
B	oh is that just my normal?
A	yeah
A	erm you did what? the the what? the electricity?
B	yeah I don't know why that just happened
A	you know that item you just bought? the what I call the
B	yeah
A	you see it charges up down here
B	oh
A	and you see it charging?
B	yeah
A	when it gets to a hundred and you attack something it lets off an electric shock
B	okay
A	so just keep walking in just just right and clicking at them
B	oh wow I didn't mean to press that
A	go and kill him just go and kill him
B	ah ah
A	stop panicking
B	yes
B	ah
A	you've you've killed them you've killed them still
A	you can't go into their spawning pot
B	okay
B	there's a lot on yeah okay
B	has it just started?
A	yep
B	okay
A	that was good yeah?
B	yeah that was good
