C	good morning everybody
A	good morning everybody we're gonna now sing er
B	this is wait a minute this is at the mass?
A	yeah
C	yeah and it's this one's about wading in water and reminding us that god is always there and we can also go go and see him whenever we want to
D	I like the way the what's the train one?
C	have you been doing that in mass?
D	yeah
B	no
B	have you?
C	it's another train themed one
D	it's called gathering and it gets earlier and earlier for people who want to listen to them before the mass
C	another train themed one and I think the sentiment of this one is that our actions on earth dictate what happens to us after life
C	it's called This Train right
D	but then our don't doesn't he put a funny?
B	and is it you is it you three
A	there's other people as well
B	oh is there?
D	yeah but there's a joke cos the last verse they put in this train don't carry no Catholics don't they?
A	mm
D	when you've
B	mm
D	this train don't carry no Catholics
C	mm
B	that's cos the Catholics all went by plane
D	the what's the other one you do?
A	loads
D	the one when he walks
C	John the Revelator
A	John the Revelator
B	why?
B	where does he get these songs from?

D	Youtube
A	oh and that famous one
C	he closes his eyes
B	you what?
D	thank the lord
B	you just thank the lord right oh god
D	you don't need a ticket

D	it's really funny
B	do people come and listen then?
D	yeah
B	mm
A	we do Boney M sometimes
D	it's like
B	erm
D	morning
C	good morning everybody our gathering
D	morning
C	hymn today is
A	he tells them off if they don't say
C	yeah
A	good morning back
D	morning
A	mm
D	them all
C	oh we're not very perky this morning shall we try that again?
C	we think I think we should get a book published of all the gathering hymns so we can roll it out nationally
D	you could
B	mm
D	what else do you do on it?
B	and how soon er how er long before mass does it start?
C	oh only a few minutes er
A	three or four minutes beforehand
B	oh only three or four?
A	mm
D	no it's getting longer
A	what time is it
B	go on how long before?
A	no seriously
B	really?
C	what time
C	is it
A	to be honest with you we get there at ten o'clock
D	the mass doesn't start at half past
A	and we practise we practise until about twenty-five past
B	oh okay
A	they are singing for half an hour
A	just out loud but people don't mind it
B	no
A	and then we do a gathering hymn at twenty-five past just to get people in the mood
B	right
A	and then they come in
C	are we in the mood for jesus?
A	the audience comes in
C	the audience
B	the audience comes in at that point do they?
B	ah
D	you only had one and she complains about everything
B	oh
A	she said we sounded too Protestant
B	oh we had a
B	complaint at our carol service as well
A	really?
B	aye not enough carols sung
B	that was that was last year
B	this year the
A	you only did twenty instead of twenty-five?
B	aye and the thing is it always ends up with a sort of carols karaoke
B	that's not really the right term but carol requests really
D	I know what you mean
B	carol requests so it's if
B	what carols would you like to sing? do you know? and so people choose
D	mm
B	and
D	mm
A	he would yeah
D	mm
A	actually maybe we should do that
C	no cos then someone'd say
D	we'd have requests?
C	can you do such and such?
B	a carol request is quite good the only thing is you need to you need people who are
B	the only thing
A	also you need more than one person
B	well
A	they're all calling and you and they're calling one out you don't know you say oh Silent Night okay
B	yeah
A	cos that's the one that you know
D	and you get the one you

D	I bet well don't do it yet
C	this is my cajón
A	oh
D	let's have a drink
B	oh gosh they even provide you with the feet
D	it's from the Peruvian slaves
B	oh
D	er they used to be fish crates
B	quite resonant isn't it?
D	good isn't it?
D	you'd be able to play that
D	look he uses his foot
D	it's a good sound isn't it?
B	yeah a good sound aye
D	he did the er Peruvian Gloria with it do you know the one I mean?
B	I do aye
D	Glory to God
B	I do yeah well that's fantastic
C	it's good fun isn't it?
B	oh yeah
D	let
A	did you er?
B	no
C	and you can just put it on your back and take it home
B	very good
C	we do this about three times I think
A	what do you want
C	E
D	coffee? tea?
D	herbal tea?
B	cup of tea
D	normal or Redbush or peppermint?
B	normal er normal's fine
D	normal
B	thank you
C	erm I'll just have a Redbush please
C	and the best thing is
B	and do you change the key each time?
A	yeah it's Elvis does it
D	it's Elvis did it
A	in the seventies
D	what does Elvis shout
B	is it?
D	in between
A	sing it everybody come on sing it everybody
D	did you said it once didn't you?
A	yeah
D	you couldn't resist it
A	yeah
D	could you?
C	and the best thing is if you use your foot
D	they do it at the end
C	to change the pitch
D	they do it at the end of
C	you just play around
D	oh yeah sorry
D	move back so we can see
C	like that
B	oh yeah
D	it's got a snare
C	and you put your foot at the top
B	that's very good
C	and you take it down
B	yeah let me wash up
D	I'll
A	you brew up
C	like that see?
B	oh
C	taking your foot down
B	gosh
C	each time
B	right
C	and so that's what you
B	so you have to work your foot as well?
C	yeah and again the pedals cos inside the sound is created by the wood which you can hit near the bottom
B	right
C	and there's also a snare inside there
B	what what is a snare?
C	just some er metal strings like guitar strings
B	oh I see
C	and they sort of vibrate
B	oh I see aye oh I see right
C	to get that
B	I hear that part
C	that clatterer yeah
B	yeah more
C	so
B	they're more tinny
C	a lot of people at first a big erm beginner's mistake is to hit it really hard with all your hands but if you you can just use your fingers like that
B	aye
C	you can get a lot of bass down there
B	I hear that
C	so the bass sound and then a more snarey sort of
B	I hear that aye yeah
C	and a nice thing to do is to roll with your fingers into a hit so
B	aye yeah I can hear that too
C	yeah it came with a free DVD but because I bought it cheap from Germany the DVD's in German so you've gotta try and guess what he's saying
B	so
D	let him have a go
B	no no thank you
C	it's dead fun
B	thank you but see after after your er there you are there's a goal for your course
C	yeah
B	to er
C	understand the cajón video
B	that's right
C	yes
D	did it could you not even put English subtitles on?
C	no there weren't subtitles on it
D	so what did you do? just watch the guy?
C	watch what he's doing yeah
B	oh aye
C	and when he started to shout you knew that what he was doing was important
B	so and that's called a what? a
C	a cajón
B	a cajón
C	they used to the African slaves in south America used to erm want to play drum rhythms that they would do at home so they would use er fish boxes and fruit boxes they were loading
B	right
C	that way they could disguise it so that people didn't realise they were having fun so to speak
B	oh okay right
C	and erm they could also use things that they all readily had as well
D	so they reckon it
C	and then
D	started in Peru on the fishing
C	yeah
D	er ports
B	oh okay
D	you know where the
B	yeah
D	slaves were in Peru and just disguise their erm African drumming
C	and then it became
B	gosh
C	a popular local instrument as well
B	mm
D	yeah put a snare in
B	it's quite erm I mean it's quite a rich sound isn't it?
D	yeah and
B	not
D	I tell you what in a church wow
B	aye
D	it doesn't half travel
B	that's great
D	it's really good
B	yeah
D	isn't it?
C	yeah
D	really good it erm what you played? just the Gloria?
C	I only took it once when my violin was broken
D	yeah
B	really?
D	you should take it again
B	have you only taken it once?
C	yeah only once
B	oh okay
D	and it was so good the sound was really good
B	cos I could see on the Peruvian Gloria for instance
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	it'd be good in that
D	yeah
C	the congregation were a bit slow in singing back though they er they sort of halved the pace so we had to keep playing slowly when they sung
D	yeah
C	and then quicker for
B	ah yeah oh
C	the worst thing I could've done was just to keep going at the same rhythm
B	oh okay
C	but I had to be I had to be heuristic
B	that's the that's the problem yeah
C	yeah
