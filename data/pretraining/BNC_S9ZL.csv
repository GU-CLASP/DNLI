C	I suppose this is bigger isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	place
C	well but the
A	and the weather the weather makes a difference doesn't it?
C	yeah they're saying Split and Dubrovnik are the more touristy places
A	right
C	see it says the Istrian hill towns
A	is Motovun one of them? or Buzet?
C	Motovun's the one on the hill isn't it?
A	yeah so we must live somewhere around here
C	yeah
A	read to you?
C	mm
A	where from?
C	don't know anything you think
A	not very hot that coffee
C	no
A	begin in Pazin which can be reached on the fast road connecting Rijeka with Rovinj and Pula this small industrial town with a population of around ten thousand may not have immediate appeal but it is worth a flying visit the highlight is the castle first mentioned in nine nine hundred and eighty-three AD as a gift from emperor Otto the second of Hungary to the bishop of Porec the castle now and ethnographic museum
B	was that was that what actually really happened or is that just mythology?
A	it says the highlight is the castle and the castle was first mentioned in nine hundred and eighty-three AD as a gift from an emperor to the bishop of Porec
C	so it's historical isn't it?
B	so it did happen?
A	yeah yeah
C	you didn't put up a sugar in there did you?
B	no I didn't
A	the castle now and ethnographic museum overlooks a great gorge known as Pazin's pit where the river Pazinicia swells after rain
B	let me get rid of the skin
A	almost encircling the town
B	just er
C	do you want me to stir it?
A	why don't you ask for some hot milk to mix it with?
B	no it's alright
C	I'd use a spoon
C	which one's that?
A	Draguc
C	Draguc
A	there
A	no
B	probably won't know any of them will we?
A	Buzet
B	probably be all like Istrian films you know like
A	Buzet is the largest of the hill towns on a bluff a hundred and fifty-one metres above the River Mirna and still partly enclosed by its medieval walls and gates
B	what's it taste like?
C	well have some pasta
A	it
C	with truffle oil
A	I'll try one of ours it tastes it's hard to describe it's
C	there you go
A	it's very it's very earthy
C	it's distinctive
A	it tastes earthy it doesn't taste like mushrooms does it? cos it's
B	is that a similar texture to mushrooms?
A	no
C	very strong isn't it?
A	so very
C	do you need a Coke as well though?
B	no I'll be fine
C	mm

C	what kind?
A	I'd love a boat
B	like
A	as long as I had someone who knew how to do it
C	yeah so you were confident
B	not like

C	I'd like that one
A	mm
C	I'd settle for that one
A	I like that one and I like that blue one
