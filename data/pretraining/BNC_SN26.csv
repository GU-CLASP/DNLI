B	is that what they say is like a primary source or d'you think?
A	crazy stuff
B	like throughout the day?
A	erm
B	no
A	I've got
B	not like a breakfast thing or?
A	in maybe weekends but
B	yeah
A	the BBC news app
B	yeah I can never understand that how d'you follow something on Twitter?
A	erm
B	cos I know you've got hashtags and stuff but
A	well you you
B	but
A	so then you'll get lots of Hearts stuff
B	I
A	erm
B	you put something back you have to do the same hashtag
A	yes
B	in order for other people
A	yeah
B	to find it
A	so like during the World Cup there was
B	so it's quite organic how it how that happens then?
A	yeah yeah
B	uhu
A	and it would just be hashtag so-and-so V so-and-so
B	okay
A	and you could basically follow the game
B	and was that like in different languages as well?
A	yeah yeah well aye yeah absolutely during the World Cup yeah yeah
B	but
A	well kinda yeah kinda yeah yeah but it's
B	like
A	yeah yeah
B	and the news
A	what's that?
B	d'you follow d'you follow? like
A	a few of them
B	columnists or something?
A	a few of them
B	and do they do they use it to break stories as well now?
A	yeah yeah absolutely aye aye so
B	like attracted interest like
A	yeah
B	breadcrumbs to to that story
A	both
B	also like they can be a bit more personal about it?
A	yeah yeah
B	so is it is it is it? d'you think it makes it a danger? or a creates a danger of the news becoming
A	yeah
B	er yeah if yeah if people like
A	yeah
B	yourself using it as one of the primary sources of getting news
A	yeah
B	d'you think that that poses a danger at all?
A	well sometimes
B	or or or is it even better cos it's so open
A	I dunno it's quite open isn't it cos? well newspapers have still got a role in setting the news agenda hey so
B	yeah
A	you so-and-so on
B	no see I'm not I'm not a fan of
A	so
B	not a fan of that kinda stuff
A	mm mm
B	like the the have your say sections at the bottom of articles
A	yeah yeah
B	and stuff or when they do a
A	yeah yeah
B	erm text in tell us what you think it's like well
A	mm
B	necessarily
A	no interesting aye that's a point but I mean
B	well it is it is but it's it's always been seen to be objective
A	mm
B	whereas Twitter is sort of by its very nature subjective isn't it?
A	mm
B	well that's what they want they want sort of er personalised opinions
A	yeah
B	well cos it opens up to
A	ah
B	to accusations doesn't it? I mean
A	some people aye
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and then also like re-tweet doesn't mean an endorsement
B	yeah
A	cos it could just be
B	yeah
A	what so
A	mm mm
B	maybe
A	mm mm
B	erm every Wednesday at twelve o'clock
A	right
B	and we'll erm
B	and and and for that hour everybody'll tweet using that certain hashtag to discuss a particular topic d'you ever think anything like that in in finance or? communications?
A	oh right
B	all the type of all the type of webinar kind of?
A	yeah yeah oh but I'll like do I I did a webinar just
B	and is that through Twitter at all?
A	no not it's all see the ones that I do are internal and therefore
B	feel free to post
B	yeah
A	slides takes questions
B	depends on the I guess on the users' or or the presenters' comfort zone in the technology as well
A	yeah
B	cos
B	Twitter Twitter's a different kind of
A	yeah yeah
B	kettle of fish in some ways
A	yes
B	yeah
A	question
B	and you get your presentation first and
A	yes
B	yeah
A	whereas
B	ah
A	you know bit three paragraph questions
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	steer it in a certain way which
A	aye totally
B	maybe doesn't really interest everybody else
A	yes yes no no absolutely absolutely so no no but not not so much on Twitter and I'm trying to think if our
B	yeah
A	like we've got accounts
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah but I tried using that with Scottish Power
A	mm
B	that was Facebook not Twitter but erm Scottish Power said leave a message
A	ah right?
A	never worked?
B	cos
A	aye see that's not that's not good that's not good yeah yeah
B	it gives you a negative impression of of them
A	yeah
B	if if they're gonna have that service
A	aye
B	then they've got
A	yeah
B	to man it
A	absolutely
B	sorting it out yeah
A	absolutely
B	yeah?
A	but they're the
A	it needs to be
B	yeah just having a Twitter
A	yeah yeah
B	badge on your on your website doesn't
A	no no absolutely not absolutely not
A	had couple of things
A	well if if you think if you if you had a
B	yeah
A	couldn't see it right you probably couldn't tell what was what
B	yeah you'd have to stick a sticker on or something
A	yes
A	Money Saving Expert re-tweeted it so
B	maybe more so than a few
A	well yeah yeah
B	of an FT article or something aye
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	it's like massive
B	you're gonna get some coverage
A	absolutely
B	so I guess it's got some benefits huh?
A	mm hm
B	through Twitter
A	right for?
B	for er
A	for that
B	for erm
A	okay
B	service or promoting something I find Twitter's good once you've got an established base
A	right right
B	to maintain a conversation but I think Facebook's better for
A	mm okay
A	see I tend to keep I keep Facebook more to my like
B	yeah
A	my Facebook was just becoming like my Twitter with like
B	yeah
A	I follow Hearts on Facebook but not erm
B	see I just yeah
A	cos I started getting I started getting all the updates for all of them on both
B	there's too much
A	gotta choose
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
B	well see d'you think there will come a point where people have to choose which one they spend their time on or or are people just quite happy to do it? I mean I see the guy next to me at work
A	yeah
B	and he's got both pages both tabs open
A	open
B	on his
A	you you could be right cos they're just trying to
B	yeah keeping people in touch with
A	yeah
B	services and
A	both of them you can now put your location in there
A	both of them you can now
B	yeah
A	you I think Twitter now you can tag people in photos
B	no
A	any more
B	no it's so it's discussion groups doesn't it?
A	you know? I've had some good answers to questions that I've posed on Twitter
B	but then there's the whole
A	what do you know about this? and
B	yeah
A	you know you
B	but then there's the whole thing with trolls and
A	mm mm mm mm
B	right
A	cos someone was like
B	so why why should they feel under pressure to do it why why even bother
A	so
B	create an account if you're gonna feel?
A	yeah yeah
B	you just open yourself
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that's a sort of anonymous abuse in some ways
A	I've seen Hearts players in trouble for like
B	might like to might like to smile whilst he's having his dinner
A	no that's it yeah yeah exactly
B	I
B	that was two different things
A	separate
B	you wouldn't you wouldn't get angry if like a a salesman lost an account and
