B	I can't remember how it all started off though
A	woah woah woah

A	oh sorry sorry babe
B	like er they do like just talks about random shit they found on the internet
C	mm
B	and er oh there was this woman on the subway in in America I think it was New York she was like she was like a fucking psychopath
C	right
B	and yeah she was like
A	you aren't gonna tell anyone about this but she loves the fact that she's being recorded?
B	yeah yeah she had like sunglasses on
A	oh wow
D	could you pass me the bottle opener?
B	and er yeah she was she was just mad like
D	has
C	erm
A	she's having some now
C	yeah
D	oh okay see you later then
A	right
C	mm
B	is this your first time having J two 0
C	no I've had J two 0 many times before why?
B	I'm gonna I'm just wondering cos you were sniffing and going mm mm it smells good
C	oh cos cos I
C	I I I think I don't remember it
A	okay
C	smelling so nice
B	right there's fifteen for you
C	I kind of smelt you know when something smells fizzy even when it's not?
B	yeah I know what you mean
C	it it kind of smelt fizzy I was like oh it's not fizzy is it?
A	fifteen for you
C	thank you
A	and fifteen for
A	so the way this works is
D	sorry
A	if you land on that you can go to any space on the board
D	you can put it here if you want
B	okay
A	er and if you roll the number you can move either way round the board
B	right
A	er on a buy or roll space you can er choose to buy a wedge for ten points erm the goal is to get all one wedge of every single colour and then answer a final question to win
C	okay
B	final question
A	so you can er buy a wedge but only one from the bank for ten points or you can roll again
B	so once once the whole game or once each time you land?
A	once once each time you land on it
B	oh right
A	erm and on a wedge space which is every other space
B	oh right
A	so if
C	I'm just gonna bet wrong every single time
A	yeah er it it doesn't say anything about not betting but I think you have to bet at least a little bit
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	erm
B	that makes sense I guess
A	yeah so you have to bet cos then if you run out of wedges er of you run out of chips then you have to do stuff
B	man I just have to bet
A	yeah basically it's gambling addiction you get
C	you're gonna get bet withdrawal
B	yeah
A	erm
C	is
C	on the table
A	yeah so so so you place a bet on whether you
B	yeah
A	er and if you guess correctly
B	oh right
A	yeah and if you get it wrong you get nothing back and it goes to the bank so yeah
B	right
A	if you answer correctly er if you answer correctly you earn the wedge and keep all the chips that were bet on wrong erm of if you already have that wedge you get five points from the bank instead of a wedge
C	yay
B	mm
A	er or place your bet right double their bets and are paid out by the bank
B	right
A	and if you answer wrong you don't get anything
B	oh right
A	erm
B	alright cool
A	yeah that's fine
B	and here I am reminding you of the rules for all the dumb fucks here
A	yeah and then
A	once one of us about to rules the rules change ever so slightly
A	erm
B	seriously like feel this hoodie it feels just like super nice
A	that is really nice
B	yeah
A	for god's sake cats bugger off right
B	oh it's just oh it's a bit small I just can't contain my bulging biceps
C	mm
B	oh there was this really weird VJ on the internet and er
A	so
B	of of of
C	okay
B	of this guy who was like a and he was like doing all these like muscle poses and he was like er
B	like a grape
A	that's weird
B	oh
A	right
B	yeah it's it was
A	so
B	super weird
A	okay so I've landed on yellow
C	I dunno what kind of category quiet is but right
C	I dunno what rain is either you know how many questions can you get about rain? but
A	yeah I I yeah I don't think the person answering the question has to also bet so
A	bet before you read the question whether you think I'll get it right or wrong
C	erm I gonna say
A	okay right how much are you willing to bet?
B	what
A	er no
B	right okay
A	do you think I'll get it wrong or right?

A	reading the question cos she's to my left
C	so I'm reading the yellow one yes?
B	oh okay
A	yeah
C	okay erm

B	so who's going next?
C	yeah so you roll the dice you move around
B	mm yeah
C	okay
