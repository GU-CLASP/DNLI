A	and there's another
B	I don't need that that can go in the

A	erm do you think she'll be wearing her perfume?
A	well
B	you think you may be allergic to it

A	I'm not the only one who noticed you said
B	she thought it was on a bit too thick
A	well she wasn't there on the day that I was noticing it
B	maybe that's just a polite way of saying it's not very nice
A	yeah
B	it was a gift
A	well it's a horrible smell to start with
B	I I can't smell it at all and you know that I've got a very sensitive nose
A	also she's putting far too much on

B	no darling
B	not terrible just not very good
B	just get a cheap flower and then you get round it by saying it's your favourite I've always loved daffodils
B	I don't know just whatever the cheap flower is
B	siblings
A	siblings that's like my vagina vagina
B	yes
A	I must have just read it and thought that's obviously how you pronounce it
B	that happens
A	but then
A	oh
B	think you read it in that little booklet
B	tampons
A	hello oh oh too much going on in here isn't there
B	good quality meat this
A	it looks it it's a beautiful colour
B	and it doesn't look there's no water coming out of it it's just browning
A	oh
B	no not always
A	well I thought it was just cheap fatty meat was quite tasty
B	well fatty meat can be tasty
A	we need to find a reason to use those sausages fifth of February they need to be eaten now
B	well you could you could cook them cos there's a dirty pan and then tell
A	yeah well we could cook them this evening
B	or
A	they might not be
B	give them to the foxes
A	they'd be quite nice cold wouldn't they? hold on it's actually it's the fourth today so they're still in date
B	never doubted it
A	er look at all these ingredients but it's sixty-one percent pork but what part of the pork? fortified wheat flour
B	whoops you didn't dissolve it
A	sorry dear
B	there
A	mm
B	that I don't have a bouquet garni cos it's too dark and I can't see what's in the garden can I have the tomato puree please?
A	shall I go out there with the torch? you mean you just want some bay leaves?
B	no I've got a bay leaf
A	oh
B	but normally I'd get thyme
A	oh oh
B	and rosemary
A	I was thinking we need a torch that goes on your head for that sort of purpose
A	I thought that yesterday when I was putting the washing line away
B	did you put the washing line
A	yes I did yeah
B	I would have walked into it
A	yes I did
B	right that's done that just simmers for
A	we are
B	four hours now
A	we are on top of the washing not literally but we are on top of it
B	so thirty-five minutes that took me thirty weirdly I think that's not too bad
A	no you started it when I started the recording and it's now twenty-two minutes past
B	so there you go
A	so that's good it is a classic recipe everyone should learn how to do spaghetti bolognaise
B	I don't use my milk anymore it's traditional to fry the
A	what are you up to?
B	fry the meat off in the milk
A	what are you up to scampy?
B	mm look everything ah
A	mm?
A	it's all changed and you've got to
B	mm?
A	remark everything
B	where's it gone?
A	got to rub everything again
B	what the blazes? er? oh he's found the chairs and they're getting marked now in their new location thoroughly
B	yeah
A	mm
B	sorry darling
A	it's what he does when things change
B	yes
A	sorry darling
B	sorry
A	and he's always very vocal
B	oh crap the fire's on it's probably burnt out cos you only brought the four logs
A	I'm just a
B	like there was one of those comedy things on Mumsnet or something about husbands and one of them she'd written she had sent him a text saying can you put the spaghetti on the stove
A	what like er in the packet?
B	he
A	on the top of the stove?
B	he took it out of the packet and just laid it on top of the stove so he'd literally put
A	yeah
B	spaghetti on the stove
A	yes it's the sort of thing I'd do
B	it didn't make sense though because you wouldn't actually cook spaghetti until that would be the last thing you'd do
A	yeah
B	although maybe actually she was coming home with a pot of pesto
A	she was probably on her way
B	a lot of people do that these days
A	no
B	er?
A	it's saying E27 one times
A	really?
B	it should last for twenty-five years
A	well let's bring it back in twenty-five
A	twenty-four point
B	and go what the fuck?
A	twenty-four months and
B	this is what you should do the lightbulb
A	no really?
B	this is what you should be doing
A	well it can't be cos it won't last that long
B	you should do this every evening darling it's it's homemaking
A	yeah I do sometimes so yeah but the lightbulb's not a twenty-year lightbulb surely?
B	what it said
A	really? it's never gonna run out?
B	that's what it said
A	er?
B	cost eight quid or something
A	well I heard that they could make lightbulbs
B	yeah they can make everything that
A	that last forever and
B	that's right
A	and they were doing it on purpose not making them that way
B	look there's
A	how funny oh that's good
B	yeah do you want to show me the little post that you made?
A	yes
B	nice here we are look
B	hello darling
A	we're being sociable hello god I think I sound incredibly stupid on these recordings
B	I think I sound
A	I
B	quite posh
A	yes you do
B	I think I sound
A	you sound really cool
B	posher than you
A	I I veer between posh and cockney I've got a really weird accent it doesn't really quite know where it wants to go
B	very
B	very jejune
A	what does that mean?
B	dunno just er what you described
A	what does jejune mean? the actual
B	we'll have to look it up darling
A	oh
B	oh look we need that
A	well you could explain it couldn't you? to me and then we'd have a
B	it means having a sort of affectation that is er oh no am I thinking of parvenu?
A	yeah it's not like my sister's for example which is definitely
B	quick I've got to look something up
A	oh
B	I blame you
A	well I blame you cos you didn't let me get out of the way and I blame you for not going to the Apple website and not buying the right thing
B	could you get me one more beer please darling?
A	I don't know why on earth you didn't go to the Apple site
B	I'm not sure they still make them why would they manufacture them?
A	you know I think it's because I'm less sure about who I am and that's why my accent veers
B	I don't think so darling
A	in different
B	well why why do you keep putting your legs
A	stop
B	standing on it?
A	because I I sit how I sit but just be careful
B	but just don't stand on the lead have that as a new rule
A	I'm not standing on the lead you're you're just not being careful enough
B	well you just stood on it
A	I didn't stand on it my leg was where it was you should have looked
B	well it's amounted to the same thing
A	it's not amounting to the same thing at all it's your responsibility
B	well your foot was in it or it was under your foot
A	my foot was just where it was
B	it's the same thing naïve immature callow showing lack of informational experience spiritless meagre arid
A	is that what you're saying I am?
A	well I hope that was the wrong word then
B	jejune
A	why did you choose that word?
B	cos you were describing your accent
A	that's not that
B	then I
A	I think you mean something else so hopefully mean something else
B	parvenu means Johnny-come-lately
A	yes please
B	it's a nice word they're both nice words
A	but they're French words so I've got to put them in French
B	no they're English
A	parvenu?
B	I mean they're from the French
A	well it's gotta be French
B	parvenu an upstart someone newly risen into wealth notice or power vulgar exhibiting an inferiority complex
A	is that what you mean?
B	that's what you were trying to say
A	no I was saying
B	that you come across as a little bit of a jejune parvenu
A	a what?
A	no
B	yes
A	cos my mum was gonna send me to elocution lessons
B	elocution lessons were the all the rage at my school my junior school elocution classes fuck knows why
A	well because people still
B	maybe it's cos everyone had a West Country burr
A	had that had that as a
B	uhu received English
A	actually still think it probably does
B	well I work with a a whole host of northerners
A	well at university you do what you work with a whole host of
B	uhu
A	northerners?
B	you should have been sent to a convent school
A	you you sent me to a comprehensive school I'm sorry
B	little delicate flower like you
A	I came out
B	should have gone to a
A	different
B	little beautiful
A	to what you wanted
B	gentian like you should have gone to a
A	a gentian
B	a a little
A	well it was
B	a a convent school
A	but it was comprehensive
B	to prepare you for the nunnery
B	right come on darling before it dies
A	the whole Catholic thing
B	again
A	it won't die unless you're clumsy
B	I reach across impatiently
A	yes you do
B	don't I?
A	same thing's gonna happen again
A	so I need to find the place where it starts
B	I can just read the whole of it
A	okay do you want to read it aloud?
B	no
A	why not? cos then there won't be a big silence
B	sweet remember how nervous you got when you thought they hadn't replied? you were in a little mood
B	you
A	I went into a crisis
B	you weren't admitting to
A	she's very pleased with that I thought she'd have already seen it
B	should buy it
A	yeah
B	yeah it's a really lovely photo
A	yeah but it seems
B	or postcard I don't know
A	well maybe it's just the way it's come across on Ebay got a weird effect on it
B	oh sweet
A	yes so we could also do the spontaneous thing if you wanted to but then I thought I haven't washed my hair for ages so I can't be spontaneous
B	well that's sweet darling
B	she said she could pop she's at home so
A	well when I wrote just funny when you see it written as for the odd cup of tea not an odd cup of tea
B	but but she was
A	a normal cup of tea
B	volunteering to drop round during the day
A	yes
B	so if you're both at home
A	yes well that's a bit oh my god full on
B	silly
B	oh he's on the white one
A	mm
B	we should start making sort of bets about which one he'll go for
B	I think I checked
A	it looked as if he was moving out again today
B	oh oh next door?
A	yeah cos he had
B	oh
A	a car full of stuff and he was putting more stuff in it
B	yeah they are just slowly I think they're the last ones there now
A	I think they're gradually doing it like you say
B	now
A	without being in a hurry about it they've got somewhere to live and they're gradually shifting stuff
B	now darling could you
A	no
A	no
B	get
A	if it's about money I can't do any of it
B	could you get the laces?
A	unless you keep talking for the value of a pair of shoes
B	could you

B	could you get the laces for me so I can look at them?
A	oh I've lost those as well they were on the table
