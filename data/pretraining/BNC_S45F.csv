B	mm?

A	mm
B	mm?
A	well we got plenty of er
B	need to seal the
A	huh?
B	should you seal the
A	I don't know but er what I was trying to say is we've got plenty of builder's
B	PVA?
A	PVA
B	mm
A	builder's PVA
B	mm
A	mixed up and you just splash that on and that sealant and then that make a good surface for
B	for painting
A	for paint
B	okay we'll do yeah we'll do that
A	yeah? well it might as well be used that's been here about thirty years
B	well that's what I'm beginning to think yeah let's use up all the paints and all the
A	yeah
B	and get back to how we should be all the new stuff
A	yeah well you buy it when you want it
B	yeah
A	you don't just go out and buy a pot of paint cos
B	well I know but that's that's got to have purpose
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so you saw the weather forecast did you this morning?
B	no it was yesterday that's why I decided to paint today
A	yesterday it said it was gonna rain tomorrow?
A	nah
B	they had
A	you can't believe that
B	Wednesday Thursday Friday rain
A	oh yeah they had those little symbols up didn't they?
B	yeah that might be all wrong but
A	but but
B	the one you like?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she said I put the symbols up but it might not rain in your area
B	okay
A	that's the way to do weather forecasts
B	well it is just a forecast it's not
A	yeah when you forecast the rain
B	it's only a guess really
A	yeah well you shouldn't forecast a a guess I don't forecast
B	bit less of a guess than it was before
A	well I suppose you forecast guesses when you guesses when you bet on a horse don't you? you just forecast that to come in first
B	mm
A	and
B	doesn't usually though
A	so whose fault is that the weather forecast or not?
B	thing is it's it's your stars your horoscope
A	oh well that's a load of rubbish
B	that's in here
A	you only believe them when they're good but when they say it says there's a lover coming along in your life it
B	same as the weather
A	no what are you talking about? there must be about thirteen billion people in this world there's more than that isn't there?
B	well we know it's rubbish don't we?
A	yeah but why do you think oh it's a good one when it is a good one? and you think oh that's rubbish when it's a when it's a
B	well if it says luck is coming your way you feel better about it than if than say oh it's going to be a doom
A	stay in bed today
B	doom
A	cos a meteorite might fall on your head
B	beware
A	on May the eleventh
B	you need to get that out of your head it's wrong
A	you'll see
B	but you can't live your life thinking I can't go on the water especially on May the eleventh
A	that's my premonition woman can't help that
B	well at least it's just one day
A	yeah so I don't have a bath I don't go outside I don't put a run a tap and I don't drink anything
B	ooh dodgy
A	no I ain't
B	water you mustn't go anywhere near water
B	which? what the ash tree?
A	ash wilt
B	do you think that's got it?
B	but it's coming to autumn
A	oh it's nothing to do with autumn autumn ash ash leaves stay on quite late so do
A	no sign well the plum trees are gone for I can't believe we missed all them plums on that tree over there out there
B	yeah the whole lot
A	the whole lot just hanging there rotten on the boughs on the branches
B	yeah
A	no
B	yeah
B	just come and eat them mm?
A	how many are frozen so far?
B	not that many because it takes such a long time to takes such a long time to pick really I think we should just strip the whole lot now and take out the ones that that's one way of doing it
A	that is yeah
B	instead of individually picking off the ripe ones
A	yeah
B	that's really quite time consuming
A	I'll do do you know what I was going to do? I was going to pick all the raspberries all of them the red ones and the and the nice ones
B	mm
A	juice them and then put them through a sieve
B	yeah
A	so you've just got juice
B	that would've been nice but they're too far gone
A	but they've gone too far now
B	mm
A	that's the sort of thing you wake up and think of in the middle of the night
B	like your apple press
A	yeah
B	and the grapes
A	yeah yeah
B	that'd be a good one
A	I've got to make a got to make a mash first I've got to make a mash
B	could still make the grapes have a bath and tread them
B	got to wash your feet then I mean your smelly feet are treading the grapes
A	well that's what gives them the flavour
A	that's what make good wine so the French say
B	I think they do keep it clean
A	well that would keep your feet clean treading grapes oh look at that lovely tit out there way there he is he's on he's on the maple now there he goes I think he was looking at the nest there he goes he's in the nest in the nest box
B	oh wow
A	oh should I make my nest in here this year?
B	was they born in there this year?

A	he's got to have another look
B	going to have a
A	he's too fat
B	oh yeah

B	he was fat
A	well it's such a beautiful nest
B	yeah I know well you just take the nest out

B	maybe
A	that was great watching them building their nest wasn't it?
B	yes it was lovely
A	then laying eggs
B	I can't can't believe we sort of got mesmerised by it didn't we really?
A	we watched
B	all together we must've spent hours and hours
A	yeah
B	was better than television wasn't it?
A	well It was cos you watched them building their nest and making it all comfy and then thinking let's get in there it'll be good and chucking it out didn't he?
B	yeah
A	chucked out a load of stuff didn't he?
B	that was nice though to get a bit of air again
A	yeah
B	see the little babies being born
A	they were funny looking things weren't they at first and then all of a sudden boof
B	pretty little things aren't they? blue tits
A	yeah they are pretty yeah there he is again
B	yeah
A	he's on a
B	yeah
A	no no they seem to prefer just
B	well they suddenly just vanished
A	yeah so do blackbirds and do you know why blackbirds disappear?
B	no why?
A	because they don't look pretty any more they moult
B	so they hide up
A	so they hide up like an ugly duckling
B	ah
A	and then when they get more beautiful and lovely they come out again and start dancing around and fighting one another
B	well
A	if they make a nest in the wild
B	mm
A	they either use it again or pull it to pieces theirself
B	ah I don't know you
A	well you do in the Winter yeah
B	no in the even in the Spring
A	oh there's a there's a
A	oh there's a long tailed long tailed tit's nest outside in the hedge and when I cut the hedge I found a long tailed tit's nest
B	I think they build new every year
A	well
B	they chuck out stuff
A	I don't know it's a lot of work look at him though he's eating he's picking all the green fluff off that
B	do they collect seeds or something?
A	no they're they're they're picking the green fly off the green bit not the dead bit
B	mm
A	they actually kept that real clean this year
B	yeah
A	there's a few bits of green fly on there but they don't half
B	the rose was good this year
A	yeah
B	yeah well they were all good really
A	we didn't water that and that's why that one looked like like it does
