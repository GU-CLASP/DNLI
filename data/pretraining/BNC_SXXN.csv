A	so the Graham Norton show
B	oh
A	was just pretty epic isn't it?
B	yeah it was it was very funny
A	yeah
B	it was yes it old Benedict was a bit of a surprise there wasn't he?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah he went all out and Johnny Depp looked a little bit worried
B	didn't he?
A	I liked how he was saying like er Benedict was saying I didn't actually meet Johnny until about six months after we'd finished filming
A	cos when we were on set he was someone else completely yeah
B	completely yeah yeah gosh he did look so different as well didn't he?
A	yeah
B	it was cos he obviously had some prosthetics and
A	yeah
B	some yes he just looked like
A	typecast
B	yeah
A	right yeah
B	always playing the sort of these really weird wacky over-the-top creations you know?
A	yeah
B	whereas he he seemed like a very humdrum
A	is it Black Mass
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think
A	yeah yeah
B	and it is getting rave reviews actually
A	oh good for him I bet
B	oh his accent I know it was a little bit strange wasn't it?
A	I can't tell if this is good or not but you're you're too English for it
B	yeah yeah
A	you know?
A	this is this is too not you at all
B	yes it was a bit incongruent wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	it was a bit odd
A	but erm I really like Daniel Radcliffe I think he's a really funny guy
B	yeah
A	when he was saying about Rupert Grint who you know? who played Ron and
B	yeah
A	and and cos Graham was too
B	yes
A	and and he was saying how how Rupert had ended up back at some girl's party cos he just kept saying just like agreeing
A	which was quite funny Rupert Grint also bought an ice cream van with some of his money from Harry Potter films
B	oh yes yeah
A	which was quite funny
B	yeah that's a bit different isn't it? oh do you know what?
A	yeah
B	and yeah and I said yes she she does and she said aw I listened to her speech erm cos she's I can't remember who she's
A	is it? some spokesperson
B	spokesperson
A	is it the erm? oh it's like the men for feminism thing I can't remember what it's called
B	yes yes that
A	I want to remember it though cos it's yeah
B	yes it is
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos she did the speech at the UN
B	yeah and
A	yeah I've seen it
B	cos it was so impressive what
A	yeah
B	you know the way she carried herself and the way she you know? what she said basically
A	she was she was a clever lady which is awesome
B	yeah
A	that's what you want
B	yeah what did she study at uni? cos she went to Cambridge didn't she?
A	did she I don't know? I remember she spent a lot of time studying and did really well on her A levels and things
B	mm yeah
A	but erm yeah
B	I I think she did you know? yeah
A	you know?
B	but yeah
A	she she's she's great I think I've seen it though
B	yeah
A	yeah I do
B	mm they've all done pretty well haven't they?
A	yeah although yeah I was just thinking like the woman who plays erm Luna Lovegood who's super lovely is like
B	oh yeah I don't know the name actually
A	she's really she's really cool she went to you know? erm I watch the Youtubers Brian and Candice they're married
B	oh yeah yes
A	they're like super Harry Potter backpack fans
B	oh are they?
A	and erm he he like loves the character of Luna
B	mm
A	and jokingly invited her to their wedding and she came which is just like
A	brilliant yeah
B	oh wow
A	but she does a lot of like fan stuff
B	mm
A	she goes to cos there's all obviously all the sort of fan conventions and things
B	conventions yeah
A	she goes to a lot of those
B	yeah yeah
A	which is which is cool
B	who's the other one? that erm aw
A	what? of characters?
B	yeah
A	er male of female?
B	er male you know of their sort of age a little bit
A	Draco Neville
B	yeah Draco
A	Draco
B	who's he? what's the
A	he's the enemy
B	yeah I know he's
A	oh oh sorry
B	I think I got that
A	yeah
B	right
A	Tom someone the actor I can't think of what his name is
B	yeah I'm sure he's doing pretty well for himself as well
A	yeah yeah he is yeah
B	I mean what a lovely way to sort of learn your craft and you know
A	yeah
B	kind of develop and grow through such a series of films really
A	yeah there's not going to be that opportunity again for people
B	no no
A	yeah
B	and in such a lovely sort of cos they've all commented on it in interviews of what a sort of family atmosphere it was really you know?
A	yeah yeah yeah totally
B	supported and you know? yeah
A	yeah
B	just a rare thing isn't it?
A	yeah so yeah it's kind of sadness that
A	five years old or whatever
B	aw
A	but oh well yeah
B	yeah
A	I was talking to
B	mm
A	we're going to get to like thirty and these actors are still going to be around like
A	it's like those are going to be our generation of actors and it was really weird
B	yeah oh yeah yeah
A	cos like yeah
B	I never asked you actually how was the film?
A	it was okay it was middling
B	right
A	it
B	oh okay yeah
A	so you know the first half maybe a bit meh but it heats up a bit towards the end
B	right mm
A	the end I didn't really like the ending though that it was too cos the thing is the ending flashes forward
B	right
A	and they try to do the flash forward but it didn't it didn't sit right
B	right
A	cos obviously it's still the same actors
B	yeah
A	and and it goes forward like five years or whatever and it it just didn't work for me
B	yeah it was a bit like last night on my mine and daddy's favourite programme which I've forgotten the name of
A	Homeland
B	Homeland thank you
B	oh
A	and that just didn't sit right because they're all the same
B	because they're all the same
A	and they didn't even really attempt to make them airbrush them a bit or whatever you know?
B	oh no
A	it was just a wig and in fact one of them didn't even look really any different the other one at least had a wig on but it
B	yeah no it actually to be fair erm I really liked the last Hunger Games book but I didn't like the ending cos there's kind of two love interest
A	oh right
B	and it's who's she going to choose and I think she should have chosen the other one
B	although I don't think that in the films cos in the films he's sort of he's not as good as he is in the books
A	right right
A	you built him up a better part in the books did you?
A	yeah in the in the in the films the guy like Peeta she goes with erm he's yeah he's kind of a bit less useless in the books
B	mm mm
A	I mean he's not he's not that bad but he's a bit soft
B	have you still got one more film to go?
A	no that's it now
B	oh that was the last one was it?
B	oh okay
A	Mockingjay part two
B	right oh
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so but
B	oh what's going on?
B	aw nice Christmas tunes help the frost
A	tomorrow morning I can
B	phew
A	yeah
B	sorry
A	me and
B	oh yes
B	that was they were being interviewed about wasn't it?
A	yeah I know I know and it looks so good
B	it does yeah oh what's the other actors name that was in?
A	James Mcavoy
B	aw he's so good isn't he? he's been in loads of
A	I'm trying to think what he's been in
B	he was Mr he was in Narnia he was Mr
A	Tumnus
B	Tumnus yes he was
A	was he? oh my god oh my gosh aw what?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	whenever we watch we always do a few chapters and then watch a bit of the film like
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and it's got
B	oh
A	it's Lucy
B	it's so so so so wrong
A	it's Lucy
B	aw
A	it's really strange
B	it's quite recent that adaptation of Jane Eyre then?
A	yeah but well it was probably about the same time as the Narnia films
B	oh really? yeah
A	cos it's like Jane when she's like seven
B	right
A	and then it skips forward like ten years
B	mm mm
A	but yeah
B	I've just got to check cos I I don't want to have got that wrong but I'm sure he was Mr
A	it's control F on this
B	yeah true ah I don't know my my little laptop seems to be struggling tonight I've already shut it down once
A	aw slow slow slow
B	I don't know whether it's the Christmas music has just sort of discombobulated it really
B	yeah it's too early it's not even December yet
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah we're not going to be able to get our Christmas tree for tomorrow are we? it's going to be at the weekend
B	I think we're going to be a weekend Christmas don't you?
A	we'll just have to try and hope that daddy forgets
B	he was Mr Tumnus in The Chronicles of Narnia
B	young for Mr Tumnus?
A	no Mr Tumnus was like such a jolly
B	yeah
A	and I'm like aw it doesn't quite mesh together for me
B	good actor then huh?
A	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah
B	he's thirty-six he looks younger than thirty-six to me
A	I say Benedict Cumberbatch look younger
B	do you?
A	how old do you think he is?
B	I would say he's probably about thirty-eight
A	you're you're close actually
B	am I?
A	I think about thirty-eight thirty-nine
B	aw
A	but I was like yeah I'm not very good with peoples ages maybe it'll come to me when I'm older
B	I think the older you get the better you get really
A	yeah
B	oh look thirty-nine
A	yeah
B	July the nineteenth yeah
A	you know Edward Monkton?
B	yeah
A	he's like actually that's not even his name he's got a different name
B	really
A	and he went to Eton and then Oxford
B	you're kidding me
A	and I was like
B	what? what? no
A	yeah cos I I typed in his name the other day and it just came up with another person it's like the creator of the
B	wow
A	if you like Wikipedia him
B	Wiki
A	yeah
B	where are you? Wiki it's normally the first one that comes up isn't it?
A	just type yeah yeah type in
A	yes
B	alright why? am I not quick enough for you?
A	see that's it that one
B	oh Giles Andreae
A	yeah
B	wow okay
A	and he went to Eton
B	went to Eton with David Cameron
A	oh no
B	for goodness sake
A	he was he was friends with no mummy
B	he was best friends with him
A	exactly
B	oh I'm not giving any more money to the Edward Monkton franchise
A	it's just the worst I can't
B	no way
A	no this is the worst
B	aw that's just destroyed a little bit of me
A	me too I mean it was bad enough and now it's worse
B	aw
B	oh mind you it's not so bad
A	oh right
B	erm
A	but is he left wing?
B	love actually well he's certainly more left than blooming right I'd say yeah what's that? oh and
A	just just write write
A	I've not heard of it but yeah
B	I used to love but that's my generation Purple Ronnie
A	aw
A	right
B	look nineteen eighty-seven was his first one I mean there was nothing else like Purple Ronnie
A	okay
B	at that time but yeah similar you know? humour
A	yeah yeah
B	it's silly little ditties he used to do
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	that's funny
B	oh how weird

A	right okay okay I'll I'll I'm preparing to be surprised you know?
B	you you will be alright then okay okay yeah you know how much I love a burning sky
