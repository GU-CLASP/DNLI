A	could you move slightly? So that we're not quite on top of each other
B	yeah I was thinking that yeah
A	there's probably a little more room for
B	better?
A	keep moving
B	oh dear
A	you were gonna tell me?
B	how is your meal
A	oh yes
B	fifty minutes
A	okay brilliant
B	and I possibly could have done more had it not been for the fact that I was getting a horrendous blister on the side of my foot and had been for the last twenty-five minutes
unknown_female	I'll give you a couple of menus okay
unknown_female	one for you ma'am
B	oh thank you
unknown_female	and for you sir
A	okay
B	Great
unknown_female	would you like to order some drinks now?
A	yes please
unknown_female	yeah?
A	um
B	erm
unknown_female	tap water
A	and can I have a large er
B	er
A	something that's
B	the one you do here
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sorry?
B	normal starter?
A	I think so
B	oh I can't even see it
A	er yes indeed
B	so yeah I was quite please with that
A	Good
B	how was your swim?
A	it was alright
B	oh right
A	as in we had a lane each to start with the three of us
B	yeah
A	and then it increased to four so I lost the lane
A	but yeah it's not I don't know one swim a week does hurt technique a little bit
B	mm
A	mind you my core was quite tired so that weren't have been helping
B	yeah
B	cool
A	work was a little bit better today
B	Good
A	no I said I was in the middle of something
B	no no um you said
A	no no I didn't
B	okay fair enough
A	erm
B	I think I might have decided actually
A	shite I haven't even looked
A	okay well default to start with of course
B	yeah
A	and then what are you having?
A	sorry put the name
B	that one ha
A	ooh that sounds lovely
A	I might have a carne calzone
B	ha
A	sorted
B	ha ha that was really easy
A	wine?
B	oh yeah
A	how about the Chianti?
B	erm wow
A	cool
B	cool
A	erm yeah it took me exactly ten minutes to get to the bus stop
B	is it slightly faster?
A	no
B	no it isn't
A	it took me nine minutes
B	mm
A	it feels closer but I'm really particularly coming back
B	yes
A	that's closer
B	that's closer but the not all of them do that is the thing
A	I think they do
B	I'm not sure cos the timetables don't seem to show that but
A	well let's see what it does tonight
B	in all fairness we could ask  in all fairness we could ask  the bus driver when we get on and say are you gonna go round erm
A	no cos the one's in the morning go around the other way
B	oh what do you mean Great then Lower?
A	sorry yeah they go Great then Lower
B	oh okay
A	so they start by going that way and then come back the other way
B	but on a night they do come in from Great though
A	only earlier on in the night
B	mm
A	oh yeah they do come in from Great
B	yeah they do
A	it's so weird
B	I always look at the timetable and then I just think it's too much effort and I don't actually care so
A	mm
B	Cos I I think it is quicker from the Hub
A	mm
B	I'm not sure there's much in it
A	I was paving it down
B	really?
A	really have enough time to look cos I had to get in and get changed sort of in  et cetera
B	oh thank you
A	erm
B	oh bless thank you
A	erm
B	right
A	but they do appear to have got paved part of it
B	awesome
A	one can only assume that that time cos the rest of the week was actually fine
B	ha um um I mean I'm wondering if
A	consistently Taylor Wimpey
B	yeah
A	we'll be doing it throughout this time
B	we'll be doing
A	yeah I think
B	we
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	oh well at least they're doing something
A	yeah
B	ah
A	really?
A	I would've brought one from work if you'd told me
B	ha ha
A	no it wouldn't have been
B	are they? What like? Well yeah I mean I guess it would cost them a lot though to get anything half decent
A	the one's we make aren't expensive
B	mm
A	the problem is
B	and the NHS just haven't looked at them or is it that they're just not common enough?
A	the NHS just haven't
B	right
A	so they'll sell the drug and the device
B	right okay
A	erm
B	ah so the NHS presumably couldn't just be like oh we'll just pour you a bit of our stuff in it and
A	what's Salbutamol?
B	it's just the drug for like when you get asthma people
A	right
unknown_female	water?
B	yes
A	I think so
B	yes I think so
unknown_female	yeah? Brilliant
B	erm to start with can we get the er Seleccin e classica please
unknown_female	seleccin e classica
A	yeah that sounds fantastic
unknown_female	is that alright?
B	yeah it sounds good
unknown_female	sorry
A	your
B	yep
unknown_female	deal?
B	and then can I get the
unknown_female	for sure
A	and can I have the carne calzone please
unknown_female	carne calzone
A	and could we have a bottle of the Chianti please
unknown_female	bottle of Chianti
B	thanks very much
unknown_female	won't be a moment
B	hmm
A	cheers
B	quick hydration is er
A	yes
B	is required
A	I'm looking forward to this
B	mm yeah I'm starving
A	it felt like a Friday today
B	yeah yeah it really has done
A	mm
B	I'm pleased we had time
A	you've had a long day
A	wow
B	I just you know ended up doing things
A	brilliant
B	mm
A	so yes any other news to report?
B	no no
A	I was thinking about when Heather turns up
B	yeah?
A	if she turns up on the Sunday
B	yeah?
A	in reasonable time
B	yeah
A	we can book her on a gym induction
B	yep
A	get her on a pay as you go thing for a week
B	yeah
A	er actually it might be slightly cheaper to get her to pay for one month if it means going like four or five times for that week
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	now you don't pay that if you get the contract
B	but er you do pay that if you pay monthly though
A	oh do you?
B	I think so
A	oh okay
B	no no she's it's a uni gym
A	oh okay
B	and er so it's free
A	are these classes free?
B	her classes are free yeah
A	wow that's good
B	I think the uni must pay for the instructor and stuff whereas at the gym obviously
A	that's impressive
B	it's very impressive yeah
A	no that's the amount the gym gets
B	mm
A	A fraction of that will go to
B	company
A	so it will go to the company and then
B	and then the instructor gets some of that
A	the instructors
B	yeah
A	yes
B	nice deal
A	and I thought
B	yeah
A	like
B	this is true
A	and then  then
B	erm
A	yeah indeed
B	Tuesday I think we should go to Body Pump
A	okay I'll run
B	well it's up to you
A	actually that might be better
B	I just think that might be quite entertaining
A	then
B	yeah it'll probably be full
A	and by Sunday afternoon it'll be full
B	oh okay
A	we'll definitely have to do Circuits on Wednesday
B	yes
A	and then something else
B	yeah
A	cool
B	sounds good
A	indeed
A	he could probably be persuaded to do something
B	I'm sure he would
A	erm
B	wouldn't put it past him
A	ah
B	mm
A	thank you
A	yep
B	hmm
A	hmm mm
B	er yeah could do
A	yeah  or something
B	yeah
unknown_female	would you like to try the wine sir?
A	er
B	um I will
unknown_female	okay?
B	mm
unknown_female	okay?
B	that's really nice
unknown_female	thank you very much
B	mm
A	ooh ah

A	thank you
B	ha it's really funny um
A	ooh that's perfect temperature
B	it it's really nice
A	well we can always get a second bottle
B	that would be excellent
A	I'm doing that next time
B	okay
A	erm
B	oh it's yummy
A	sorry?
B	yummy
A	the erm
B	yes
A	the erm
B	erm
B	hmm?
A	might be an idea
B	shall I text him?
A	yeah if you want to
B	yeah um she did um she doesn't like beef so we could do lamb again
A	we could do a bit of
B	mm
A	although much more expensive
B	mm I dunno though Morrison's might do a decent
A	I do prefer it with the I do prefer it as a meat because you can have mint sauce with it which is better
B	yeah which is yummy yeah
A	but we can er oh it was very nice last week
B	yeah
A	in the lounge
B	yeah it was cool actually yeah
A	watching films cooking a meal
B	and we got yeah we got got jobs done
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I suggest we do er that pasta
B	what the?
A	that lovely Jamie Oliver pasta
B	yeah
A	we can get a big vat of it and just serve up
B	I was gonna say yeah we could just erm we might have to do it in the wok
A	yeah I was anticipating that
B	or how we always do it in the wok and then put yeah I hope we have enough room in the bowl for pasta
A	maybe a bit more than that
A	ooh
B	yeah?
A	interesting
B	ha
A	hang on
B	ah
A	ooh that sounds good
A	well that and just two liqueurs
B	er well yes or you can just just have the erm just er just for that
A	yeah
B	but they might yeah they might give us that
A	is it?
B	hold the coffee
A	can you just give us the liqueur and the coffee separately?
B	yeah
A	this is going to the
B	hmm
A	oi
B	cool
A	oh goodie
B	very exciting
A	what does it involve?
B	I think it's just a a kind of where are the fire exits? Erm
A	where the?
B	where what would you do in an event
A	hit the fire alarm if safely possible
B	Don't run with
A	and exit the building
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that they just have to do
A	they don't have to
B	yeah
A	I didn't have to do one
B	did you not?
A	no
B	you had to do a thing for your was it
A	there is a class for it being open beam laser
B	yeah
A	but the classes don't come higher than that
B	oh right
A	basically
B	right
A	within that class there's possibly even not the most interesting er but the U S military has finally developed a laser which can sink a ship
A	admittedly it was a small ship
A	erm
B	right
A	A bit underwhelming
B	so so a lighter could
A	well not from a mile away
B	ah yes that's true
A	here
A	it's gone out
A	at which point we are just essentially just throwing shells which is pretty much what they've done for hundreds of years
A	yeah so that's the laser
B	ah it's scary
A	yes we we are speculating a bit for the erm what you have to sacrifice to the spirit of the laser drill in order to get it to work
A	we've got two summer students coming
B	ha ha nice
A	we've got
B	do you want to make the greatest sacrifice for this company?
A	well we've got a uni student and two summer students
B	oh okay cool
A	I'm gonna corrupt one of them
B	how long does uni? Is it a a whole year
A	yeah
B	with with TCP?
A	yeah
B	nice
A	it would be a good placement
B	it would be an awesome placement yeah
A	the odds of being employed afterwards are possibly questionable
B	mm
B	yes
A	erm so it's fantastic for project leaders cos they get sort of free labour
A	yes
B	do you do like school's work experience or did you just really not have anything that could be done?
A	no it's all pretty skilled
B	yeah yeah
A	what?
B	I think that thing that just went past was a sharey thing
A	that thing?
B	mm
A	er it would be a good gig if you could get it
B	mm
A	you apply
B	about work experience? Or?
A	they won't be hugely cos they can't be really
B	exactly yeah
A	I mean I I I mean you'd probably need you know straight A A levels but that's not exactly selective
B	mm but that's not you know I was gonna say it's not the biggest differentiator
A	mm
B	but yeah I guess it's kind of frustrating if you think this is an amazing company
A	yes indeed
B	not really sentimental but I guess
A	so I saw some pigs skinned today
B	you saw some?
A	yep
B	mm
A	out by Uxbridge
B	Good good
A	what's this what's it er the easiest available substitute for human skin
B	mm
A	you don't have to flay anyone
A	blood
A	no it it does distinctly say do not store food in here
B	nice
A	ooh
B	yes you mentioned that
A	actually that was in the cupboard
B	I would have fridged that I've gotta say
A	well to be fair I don't think it's going to get any worse
A	anyway sorry you were saying
B	yeah um I can't remember what I was saying
A	you had something in the cupboard
B	I've I've noticed our fridge says um this
A	oh you haven't heard this that's right so we've got I dunno stop me if I've told you about this
B	okay
A	so er ST have just moved back into their office which has been redone
B	sT sorry?
A	erm Systems Technology
B	cool
A	probably
A	I'm never too sure
B	this is for
A	er and and next to it what used to be a lab has been turned into a slightly smaller huge sort of coffee area of tables and what not and a really posh coffee machine
B	right
A	we got an email sent around at the start of this week saying right you may have noticed this has been finished
B	right
A	it's I think that's us
B	ha
A	it's not for
B	ah
A	it's not for use
B	olives?
A	it's not for use for lunch
B	right
A	it's basically just for use for work related meetings
B	that's really bizarre
A	as sort of as a brainstorming space
B	hi you erm
unknown_female	it took a while to get to you
unknown_female	I'm gonna come right in through the middle like this
A	ah
B	oh lovely
unknown_female	there we go
A	perfect
unknown_female	now careful cos anything china on there is gonna be super hot
B	right
unknown_female	okay?
A	okay
unknown_female	and the food should be as well
B	excellent
unknown_female	alright? Enjoy
A	Great
B	mm
A	erm it's not for use
B	right
A	you know um
A	for erm just to take coffee back to your desk because it's very expensive
B	right so hang on so this
A	mm
B	that's ridiculous
A	mm
B	so but do you have like a sort of a lunch area?
A	no
B	like a normal sort of coffee room
A	well we've got the Moat House which is sort of for a cafeteria
B	right
A	slash restaurant on site
B	mm
A	which you can eat your own food in
B	but it would make more sense really to have a a one in the office
A	yeah
B	you could nip in have a quick sandwich
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well in all fairness we've got some in our office
B	ah is that what it's called?
A	yeah
B	cute
A	well possibly because we have a high proportion of women so that's why it's
B	right yeah
A	acquired that name
B	mm
A	yeah
B	well no as in it was kind of like that at the minute but it's different floors and a bit better whereas this is gonna be massive
A	mm
B	as in you can't have one coffee area for all those people
A	do you use your coffee area?
B	yeah
A	what for?
B	having lunch
A	mm
B	it's a bit nicer
A	yes
B	hmm mm
A	incidentally um can I um at some point can I just come in and look round your office?
B	yeah I guess so
A	I might need a health and safety induction
A	shall we book  for next week?
B	mm mm
A	are you sure?
B	ah if you wanna go next Thursday I'll have to really get in touch with them tomorrow probably
A	mm
B	yeah that'll be nice
A	no work there
B	oh work there sorry
A	actually we probably ought to get round to it at some point
B	yeah
A	yeah well you keep mentioning it and never doing it so
B	ha ha
A	anyway why not er cease the
B	hope it's not gonna be like a
A	it might be
B	hmm mm
A	so you're getting the tickets so if she gets chucked out it's on you
B	mm mm
A	who knows
B	I wouldn't put it past
A	mm
B	ha yeah
A	how about the smaller one? Do you have that one?
B	yeah that's fine
A	I had sort of two smaller ones
B	mm mm
A	semi deliberately
B	hmm mm
A	the thing about foraging
B	um yeah on telly
A	mm
B	and the chef there goes about wandering around in Sweden picking things
A	right
B	mm
A	mm
B	ah yeah
A	yeah he's making off in a B72
A	shot
B	hmm mm
A	it is true
B	it's not the best car for a PI to drive
A	do you think so?
B	oh well yeah
A	it's a trade off between that and speed
B	yeah
A	I mean what you want is a fast normal car so like a suked up B70 or something
B	hmm
A	no I always want a suked up B70
B	hmm mm fair enough
A	so the Norish Gods
B	yes
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	there is
B	how many have you had? Oh excellent
A	I've had two as well
B	oh excellent
A	so has your mum
B	hmm mm
A	hey what's
B	she just doesn't like it
A	when's she ever had it?
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	mm
A	sorry?
B	squid
A	mm
B	ah it won't be so bad having a her birthday while she's here because we like birthday's in the corpus corner
A	oh God
B	hmm mm
A	corpus corner
B	hmm mm
A	right
B	and um
A	how did he get there?
B	flew
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	little coloured chickpeas
A	mm
B	oh thank you
A	yeah
B	Don't yeah exactly
A	so I reckon that um oh interestingly thinking about that that list of people who have like set executions
B	oh yes
A	erm India wasn't on there at all
B	what because of
A	yeah so you're beaten on a higher moral ground by India
B	I'm not sure India's particularly bad
A	very corrupt
B	mm
A	but yes I mean
B	but in the scheme of things not quite as bad as some of the others on that list
A	no I mean on balance it's done the best out of the former British colonies
B	mm
A	really rather well in fact
B	yeah
A	well Australia arguably
B	ha ha
A	I dunno
B	you know that was the erm plan?
A	yeah I know
B	no
A	is she getting er gradually fatter?
B	I would assume
A	pregnancies
B	what sorry?
A	pregnancies
A	sorry?
B	May be she's just storing it all for when we next talk
A	okay well she's not gonna be at
B	ah
A	er you're getting to check
B	shall I ask her?
A	I'd say you could you probably could go on Saturday night cos erm well actually your parents might appreciate some company wouldn't they
B	possibly yeah
B	right
A	um
B	I mean if you don't wanna go er this weekend like I could get the train
A	no no no
B	are you sure? I mean
A	oh well that's alright
B	that's not like
A	it's probably about four or five drive actually but but mentally it's just a day trip
B	in one day yeah
A	yeah
B	is it depressing that I've texted
A	no
B	not particularly actually yeah
A	I text
B	sorry?
A	I class
B	ha ha yeah
A	I do that
B	I know you do
A	it's occurred to me Dad could get just a pay as you go membership at the gym which would enable him to use it with
B	er your
A	yeah
B	yeah the one in Harlington you mean?
A	no
A	yes the idea being that he and I could alternate weeks with
B	oh sorry with
A	probably
B	probably
A	but you can get a free pay-as-you-go membership
B	mm
A	and one could yeah to to sort of have a gym session you that'll probably be free if you having a PD session
B	yeah
A	so er beyond an induction that could work quite nicely
B	cool
A	I can't believe they charge you thirty quid for an induction
B	really bad
A	it is really bad to
B	like five minutes of someone going this is a running machine
A	yeah
B	ha thank you ha
A	mm
B	the which machines?
A	any of these machines
B	what the person giving the induction?
A	no no my as in i don't use any of the features or anything
B	oh right yeah I see what you mean yeah
A	now the rowing machine I click just row
B	ha yeah
A	yeah which is an
B	mm
A	still good for core stability
B	yeah well that's what I thought
A	you're um gonna be in good shape for this ten K
B	well yeah I'm I'm thinking I can probably do it
A	I think you probably can
B	ha
A	I'll have the crust if you don't want it
B	yeah
A	I couldn't do that
B	it's
A	you need something to focus on I mean in the distance to maintain your balance
B	oh well yeah I'm actually gonna write to them whoever runs it
A	preferably a window or a TV screen
B	but I was wondering at
A	or a mirror would do
B	Cos there's a TV but there's two there's a treadmill little window treadmill
A	that's stupid
B	then TV
A	that sounds utterly ridiculous
B	it is ridiculous yeah
unknown_female	alright guys
A	that was lovely
B	Great thank you yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	yeah the er the ribs were a nice change to the chicken actually yeah
unknown_female	yeah  what you normally get when you come here
B	yeah they're good
unknown_female	but what the thing is we forgot erm cos we've been having them for so long we forgot to tell those customers on Saturday so we had a couple of people say obviously
B	oh right
unknown_female	cos I suppose if you're expecting chicken and you don't like pork then
A	mm
unknown_female	it's not so welcome so
B	yeah sure
unknown_female	we've got to make sure we let everyone know
B	fair enough
unknown_female	thank you
A	you can shove them in my direction
B	I was gonna say yeah
A	I do
B	oh fair enough
A	have you got a free weight section?
B	yeah
A	you
B	no it's it's really good actually
A	you see that's what I said about our at that stupid meeting when we should be at work
B	I know
A	erm
B	yes erm
A	erm because
B	that would have been so much better
A	well no I just suggested a free weights gym
B	well it could
A	quite a lot of business done in a gym working out over lunch time
B	could you not just stick a few cardio machines in there or would it or would that just er er make the cost?
A	you're getting more expensive and they need to put an AC unit in there so
B	mm
A	like heavy AC
B	yeah
A	see we've already got showers and stuff so
B	mm
A	realistically
B	so it wouldn't actually be that much of an issue
A	no
B	suggest it
A	I
B	it's the kind of company where they actually listen to the employees
A	no it's not
B	no?
A	as evidenced by the stupid room
B	well yeah fair enough
A	they've probably spent quite a lot of money on
B	did anyone say though?
A	as in they've got
B	ha
A	yeah basically
B	I love stuff like that
A	well so it's got a posh coffee machine and it's not for clients and we've been told not to use for other purposes
A	yeah
B	there's a posh coffee machine in there which is sort of locked so you can't use it
A	is it free?
B	yeah
A	um
B	but it's it's one of those ones they always have in car show rooms
A	yep
B	with the little sachets
A	I mentioned that to er to
B	mm
A	that er I wasn't in fact keen for coffee that er you have the strength  one of the car show rooms
B	ha ha yeah
A	I thought it was quite er quite funny
B	hmm mm
A	I think it's this weekend but
B	this weekend? Oh right
A	I haven't had a call
B	oh right
A	I don't effectively want it for anything
B	no but I mean just if you fancied borrowing a fancy car but it's pointless sort of changing our plans and making it a bit more of a you know
A	yeah
B	pointless it being a erm an inconvenience for us
A	I mean originally we want a Zero D
B	no
A	and slightly improved efficiency in general
B	mm
A	so is that that?
B	engine wise?
B	mm
A	objectively
B	yeah
A	it it will sound better because it's a five cylinder
B	mm
A	and
B	roar
A	yeah indeed
A	I don't like them
B	is this
A	who's
B	sweet
A	oh um no
B	have they?
A	there's bits of brick all over the floor
B	oh
A	but sort of er you know perhaps sort of I don't know that kind of size
B	shit
A	I'm not sure
A	yeah
B	and they
A	occasionally
B	so there's there's few people that could be
A	but it's
B	at the end of the day
A	yeah that is our
unknown_female	I'll just put that there
B	oh thank you
unknown_female	that's for you sir
A	er that is what's in our property
B	yeah well exactly
A	but it doesn't make any difference
B	the road isn't but
A	exactly it'll be concerning their damaging their cars more than us
B	lovely
A	well like I say it'll be damaging their cars far more than damaging our house
B	well yeah
A	but that's not the point
B	but no that's not the point
A	there is a principle involved
unknown_female	there you go
unknown_female	any black pepper for you at all?
B	I'm fine thank you
unknown_female	no?
A	I'm okay thank you
unknown_female	and are you alright for drinks at the moment?
A	yes
B	yeah we are
unknown_female	enjoy
B	thank you
B	anyway
A	mm
B	very quickly
A	mm
B	well I mean
A	active
B	yeah
A	I mean I'm up for that in principle
B	mm
A	I mean I think what we might say is you wanna put it on
B	yeah
A	but
B	you get all the beer and um
A	another thing is it's our house
B	yeah quite
A	but that's ridiculous that that's happened and no one's told us about it
B	in all fairness we could just go and look at the cars
A	yeah I'm contemplating it
B	mm
A	but I don't see how you could do that
B	could it be one of the people who turn?
A	yeah possibly but he has to be turning pretty tightly
B	mm
A	yeah but that they
unknown_female	would you like any black pepper or anything on that?
B	no I'm fine thank you
unknown_female	are you alright?
A	I'm good thanks
unknown_female	thank you
A	but they put tyre marks onto it
B	mm
A	level of impact
B	yeah
A	yeah it's okay to lose a bit of rubber
B	well is there was there any paint or anything?
A	not that I could see
B	mm
A	so I dunno
B	mm it's weird
A	a bit of a mystery
B	hmm
A	oh
B	hmm mm
A	underneath underneath
B	ha ha yeah
A	well like I said in practice it has almost zero impact on us
B	mm
A	I mean it is just the principle
B	yeah
A	ah yes maintenance company
B	mm
A	it also makes me slightly curious at what Taylor Wimpy did to have invested the first year's the balance of the first year's maintenance
B	what do you mean er mm like?
A	they've got that on completion
B	well quite
A	such is life
B	such is life indeed
A	well
B	we haven't done badly really it's
A	no I mean I keep thinking about sort of enjoying my lovely commute
B	mm
A	and comparing it to like oh
B	yeah
A	living in a shit hole
B	yeah
A	with a load of randomers
B	yeah
A	and paying quite a lot for it
B	yeah
A	the  for it
B	well
A	mm
B	yet I don't think he's quite cos I mean
A	I'm not really sure if he
B	right
A	no
B	no? You don't remember?
A	we were talking about it
B	oh right
A	no I think you were just drunk
B	hmm mm
A	yeah
B	out of four
A	it is possible
B	I imagine he'll get a PhD elsewhere not a problem
A	I wouldn't assume
A	mm
B	mm
A	life
B	life generally
A	he's lovely
B	mm
A	it's unusual but none of those things are in a bad way
B	mm
A	and say oi geezer
B	in no offence if ever if I had if I write on
unknown_female	alright guys? How are you doing?
A	lovely thank you
B	it's great thank you yeah
A	yes
B	that's a good idea
A	mm
B	ha ha yeah
A	but yeah I do erm it is a good situation to be in
B	mm
A	um
B	right
A	comparing the er fortunes of two Cambridge graduates
B	oh interesting
A	well it's
B	erm which one? The one from the year below us or the one from the year above us?
A	below
B	oh
B	I know who you mean
A	well
B	I know  I know  exactly who you mean so er
A	yeah
B	okay that's interesting so she was in the
B	yeah
A	yeah or something like that
B	what's her fortune then? Is she I'm guessing not particularly done well
A	no no opposite erm
B	oh right
A	she's held up as an example of some one who has done well
B	nice
A	I didn't know charities had graduate programmes
B	hmm
A	apparently they do
B	does it say which charity?
A	no
B	I applied for a few charity jobs though in all fairness but they were quite small charities
A	no it's erm it's interesting
B	right
A	erm but she's like I don't know if she wrote all this herself but it so ridiculous
B	she probably didn't then
A	mm
B	she's a really nice person
A	I suspect it's her words from an interview
B	mm
A	which is broken up
B	yeah I suspect so
A	erm
B	yeah
A	which is of course a degree
B	yeah yeah
A	it's actually a very unusual degree with a two two
B	but so it's a a BA in vet
A	mm yeah
B	veterinary science
A	mm yeah
B	how? How? You know how many questions there are
A	well exactly
B	ha well it's just you know
A	yeah or you could blurb
A	mm
B	that's not really representative though cos
A	mm
B	and probably knew how many questions there were in her exam
A	yeah but it was just for contrast between the two
B	I mean I think there's better examples than him
A	that's true
B	I dunno
A	um
B	I mean
A	if you got a two
B	true yeah
A	you know an accountancy firm job or
B	mm
A	there are options she just
B	mm
A	um
B	and it's you know it's working out which is great but yeah I see what you mean
A	well in fact she didn't get a very good degree
B	yeah but that's the same as my degree
B	I think she did pretty well
A	yeah but
B	it wasn't really extreme top end
A	yes you were
B	oh yeah that's true
A	you were extreme top end for a two one
B	I forgot about that
A	mm
B	hmm mm yeah it did but still
A	you'd be in exactly the same position doing exactly the same thing
B	I would be
A	but I can't see any of them having taken you
B	mm
A	mm
B	I also did go mental on
A	yeah well you know this guy was saying he was doing five or six a week
A	but
B	and I did that for a while
A	well no unfeasibly there's a peak in the
B	it depends how broadly you look cos I was looking quite broadly but not anything
A	you you weren't going into graduate schemes
B	any
A	which in retrospect I think was a mistake
B	what a college admin job? Why?
A	well I dunno
B	mm
A	unfortunately they probably knew that
B	yeah
A	that's possibly why you got it
B	yeah
A	yeah obviously
B	mm
A	it's an interesting tip though
B	mm
A	because if you aim too low you won't get it
B	well no that that's something definitely to learn I think
A	now that's special
A	she should have done that
B	we want you to aid us in our drugs trafficking efforts
A	I think it was an appalling job
B	was it? I thought she
A	not that just you're you know you're paid the amount that
B	mm
A	sorry?
B	I don't think any one's paid anything in theatre though
A	actors?
B	no actors in theatre aren't paid anything either
A	oh God
B	true
A	yeah
A	in what?
B	um Wilde
A	oh dear Lord
B	actually it used to be
A	didn't Bosie have an arse? That's why Wilde liked him
B	no he was an arse
B	he was a bit
A	and he was
B	and he was kind of er special
A	yeah but so what? You're not no mate you're not special get back in the box
B	which box?
A	I dunno but
B	the box ha
A	well like and it's not as if he was campaigning for gay rights or anything
B	no he wasn't
A	exactly so it's just like
B	but what he did do though um
A	bugger all? No no sorry bugger someone um
B	well he was
A	in what sense?
B	which led to example
A	that's a straight name if ever there was one
A	how the hell is he was he investigated once he'd won it?
B	hang on I don't really know
A	possibly friends in the er police force
B	there was well yeah there's something yeah basically yeah I can't remember exactly what happened but then he was investigated again in another trial and found guilty and sentenced to two years hard labour or whatever
A	didn't he die in prison?
B	no he's he became very ill in prison and had um cerebral meningitis I believe which is pretty nasty
A	no um but I I never liked him purely because he's got that Stephen Fry complex of
B	ha I don't think he's just a
B	I think if anything it's an Oscar Wilde complex
A	fine either way it's they're both arseholes as in they're both too aware that they have
B	are you just associating the two?
A	they're
B	mm
A	not tenuous
B	but you ah but if if you oh you say oh cos I've read um I've read Hamlet
A	no but there's a very distinct very unusual personality in erm
B	mm
A	oh sorry
B	lady
A	no
B	um Importance Of Being Earnest?
A	yep
B	um
A	that's it
B	I don't actually know the play at all
A	the lord chap
B	I don't  I don't  know it at all
A	well he is essentially Wide
B	okay
A	I possibly have an association with Stephen Fry
B	mm
A	based on the fact he played him
B	yeah
A	sorry?
B	Wilde isn't as good as me or
A	you watched it when you were eighteen?
B	yeah
A	of course
B	not particularly
A	I didn't say that was cause and effect
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	I know
A	I'm not entirely sure that that follows
B	A modern understanding of Oscar Wilde? If you try and explain Oscar Wilde to a thirteen year old you'd probably say oh he's a bit like Stephen Fry
A	that's probably a fairly accurate assessment
B	mm anyway
A	I'm not sure I agree
B	not not a particularly
A	I think there's far more fascinating people
B	oh I'm sure there are but I
A	and from the same era
B	it's a bit later
A	A Con Doyle
B	mm I'd love to know more about him
A	you see again
A	it was Sherlock Holmes and the mysterious case of Conan Doyle
B	oh did she? Oh that doesn't
A	remember she got that box set? No last year
B	yeah oh yeah last year
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well biographical
B	oh
A	well it was semi-auto as in it's
B	was he
A	Wilde isn't very complex
A	he er at the time he was different
B	well exactly
A	I don't think unfortunate and interesting are the same thing
B	why unfortunate?
A	sorry?
B	I never heard
A	well as in he was
A	probably gay
B	oh
A	and then died possibly as a result
B	yeah
A	that's not a fortunate story
B	whatever
A	but beyond the fact that he was slightly unfortunate he's not very interesting
B	I disagree
B	I find him interesting
A	whereas look into Conan Doyle's stories
B	mm
A	so we're talking a man whose father was in a mental institution
B	interesting
A	er in Edinburgh
B	yes
A	A man who had a a
B	mm
A	Cos of course er
B	mm
A	that's the point
B	well that's interesting
A	you didn't know that?
B	no
A	no he studied under professor Bell who pioneered forensic science at Edinburgh University
B	mm
A	what is it?
B	Reichenbach Falls
A	it's not Moriarty is it?
B	no
A	right
B	it's really good
A	moving on
B	his dad was in Edinburgh
A	yes
B	so Conan Doyle is Watson
A	and he he's married but he begins an affair
B	Conan Doyle does?
A	yes
B	with this marriage?
A	not exactly no
B	sort of thing
A	but plutonic marriage and he starts an affair
B	mm
A	and he supports her very faithfully through that while also seeing his mistress who he then marries after his wife's death
B	mm
A	but he never lets his wife down or abandons her at all
B	does the wife know about the mistress?
A	I don't know
B	and
A	as in I can't remember
B	alright fair enough
A	yep
B	mm
B	yes thank you
A	please
B	mm
A	no opium
B	was it opium he took? I don't think it
A	yes
B	it's not
A	it is
B	it's not opium
A	it's er it is
B	okay
A	no it's in the books
B	no no I know it's in the books but does is it Conan Doyle's personal experience of said drug?
A	I have no idea
B	Cos I find that interesting about Sherlock Holmes
A	why?
B	because the idea that now er it it's a very modern conception of drugs that they narrow the mind and make you stupid and ruin you
A	no some drugs do
B	well er I think they try and kind of get across the message that hey kids drugs are bad
A	no no but no but er cannabis
B	mm
A	other drugs don't in some way they have other very unfortunate side effects
B	mm
A	but they don't I mean opium is er heroin is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so The Beetles wouldn't have written a lot of their crazy music without acid
A	acid?
B	acid
A	that's not a drug
B	I don't know
A	what?
B	there's a Bill Bailey sketch where he's he's saying you know if someone wants to describe something as being really kind of quirky and different and amazing and modern they're like you you know it's like so and so on acid
A	see the woman behind you?
B	mm
A	look at the hair colour
A	that's weird
B	so he's talking about um yeah so and so on acid you know
A	well it's not boring
B	fair enough yeah
A	when did they break up as a band?
B	er late
A	who shot him?
B	A guy called Mark oh er this is a really good trivia thing
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
unknown_female	would you like any dessert to have a look at?
B	ooh
unknown_female	try that
B	um possibly
unknown_female	yeah do you wanna have a look?
A	okay
unknown_female	yeah
A	yes please
unknown_female	there are like two doughnuts a mini lemon and a mini chocolate
A	yes indeed
unknown_female	yeah is that alright? Okay
B	yeah it sounds great
A	let's maybe wander after this
B	pardon?
A	we can maybe wander into a bar or something afterwards
B	yeah that sounds good
A	ring him
B	I'll ring him when we've finished
A	Tuesday
B	Tuesday oh
B	I like that
A	actually I think the rest of it might be mine if that's okay
B	I've had probably more than you
A	yes
B	and I love it
A	yes you've had another glass
B	I loved it when he discovers in the modern film that playing random notes if this randomly but then when he plays a erm chromatic scale they they switch flying circles
B	yeah
A	we should watch those again
B	they are good
A	we've got six
B	oh
A	made one of those
A	okay sure
B	he's not that weird
B	it's so good
A	but the final one was very clever
B	oh
A	media manipulation I thought was exceptional
B	oh it was so good
A	third series
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so everyone was a bit like are they actually gonna end it
A	that's not
B	but that wasn't stopping sort of
A	that had gone downhill
B	yeah that wasn't stopping cos of having too much of a good thing
A	I don't know who what writers were doing
B	the writers probably knew they weren't gonna be paid after the end of it so decided just to screw it over
A	yeah
B	they probably stopped putting any effort in what so ever
A	Cos the first series was it was
B	it was the first series was so good
A	that was very different
B	yeah
A	and again it had run into a series of space battles and it was like
B	yeah it was like well this isn't very interesting
A	no there were aliens briefly
B	the blue ones?
A	so yeah the blue ones
B	yeah the they are a bit weird though because they they didn't really do
A	yes
B	the God? Oh the God
A	yeah
B	ship
A	that was fucking weird
B	mm
A	that was kind of the point
B	mm
A	in that um you can believe in a higher power and they did and there was a higher power on that planet
B	I just think it's interesting how Stargate's really interested in this theology thing
A	well no
A	but I defy anyone to erm to watch that and then
B	it would certainly make you think about what why
A	well not not to be able to question the catch twenty-two in the belief of a god
B	yeah
A	what is a god except a more powerful being more knowledgeable being
B	yeah
A	in in which case that's not you know that makes us a god to a pig
B	yeah exactly that's the difference in Stargate
A	but in that case why would a being of supreme moral worth want us to worship them?
B	yeah
A	er er er because ultimately there that's very self-serving and they certainly could would not and could not punish you for not worshiping them cos that would
B	yeah
A	indeed and therefore defies the point of
B	it is a catch twenty-two I agree
A	yeah
B	it's really interesting
A	well it amazes me how many very intelligent people don't understand that
B	but yeah anyway no er er I agree like Universe was great but then it kind of went a bit
A	yes
B	it felt a little bit
A	I mean unfortunately that meant that Stargate has fizzled out
B	Cos
A	it just fizzled out
B	yeah it it did fizzle out with
A	well no cos er they knew SG-1 was gonna stop at some point between the seventh and tenth series
B	what because it Richard Dean Anderson had left do you mean? Or just because?
A	sort of
B	oh right
A	um none of the Star Trek
A	all of the Star Treks stopped after seven seasons
B	that's interesting
A	arguably yeah
B	it's a long time
A	but erm so at the end of season seven Stargate SG-1 had a huge high budget finale episode
B	right
A	that could very easily been the end
B	should it have been the end do you think? I don't know if I've seen enough of the later ones
A	complicated
unknown_female	alright? I'll just get you a couple of small spoons
B	thank you
A	I feel that this may be over priced
A	shotgun chocolate
B	yeah
unknown_female	there you go
A	thank you
B	lovely
unknown_female	okay? Enjoy
B	thank you very much
A	erm so yeah
B	I'll just turn it round
A	oh?
B	turn it that way and then you can get the chocolate and I can get the nuts
A	um well it's complicated
B	ha ha well he's never really left
A	he stopped being the leader of SG-1 after season seven
B	right
A	he came back as the leader of the SG-C for the season eight
B	so
A	mm
B	not quite as big as SG-1 but
A	and the idea was that he was spending more time with his family
B	right
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	less location filming I guess
A	oh almost none
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	um
B	okay
A	but hang on
B	oh right
A	I think
B	he was still quite involved then
A	yeah
B	how is that executive producer isn't the same as producer
A	yeah but he did that for the entire series
B	from the beginning?
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	oh
A	that's one of the nice things about it
B	mm
A	you know it had serious moral issues but it was also funny in a way that Star Trek never was
B	star Trek's never funny
A	A lot of the comedy came
B	mm
A	none of Star Trek is funny
B	mm
A	no
B	and it felt quite laboured
A	no I disagree
B	no no I haven't
A	that was nice
A	shall we take the bill?
B	yeah ooh I need to get my thing out
A	yes yes you do
B	oh I'll finish this first
B	I haven't spent it no
A	I might need it for tomorrow
B	have fun
B	yes
A	yeah
B	does she know how long she's gonna be off?
A	either a couple of months ten months or permanently
B	right
A	I assumed you had to say when you were coming back
B	no but you surely you have to replace them
A	no that's the point
B	no I mean replace them as in maternity cover
A	I don't know but
B	so yeah you take either so
A	see I still don't think it's reasonable that you have that kind of
B	mm
A	yeah but for a few months it's paid
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well
A	I'm sorry but why shouldn't?
B	no but in all fairness though dad's can have fully paid paternity leave
A	not for anything like the same amount of time
B	I think you should be able to argue one parent has yeah fully paid long term maternity leave
A	yeah well in ninety-five percent of cases it would
B	like well how what happens if there's a couple so like erm baby and friends
A	yeah
B	who gets the maternity slash paternity leave out of those three? You know how does that work? If one person can have it to look after the babies but one person has just given birth
A	well by that logic you should be able to have it for adoption
B	you can
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	exactly because
A	remind me never to employ a woman
B	Cameron?
A	yeah David Cameron
B	oh
A	so you know it's international woman's day?
B	erm yes
A	sorry let me just murder a prostitute and move on
B	mm?
A	I'm sorry how ridiculously offensive is that?
B	I only know about that cos of the Google logo
A	well indeed but
A	but honestly I didn't know what it was but er
B	I just I hovered my mouse over it while I was typing something in
A	no I was looking I was too eager to get to the forum
A	but er there's irony for you
B	ha yeah nice
A	er but you know so he's now making stalking a criminal offence
B	that seems reasonable cos stalking is kind of scary
A	no but it
B	no but stalking is
A	and no no but just but it's already in effect as in er I think you can be possibly
B	mm
A	specifically what this does is enables the police to enter a property without a warrant on suspicion of stalking
B	mm
A	that's just gonna er but that's just gonna abate a woman saying I don't like this man
B	hang on
A	well they are just making it more slightly more they're just giving the police more power to deal with it
B	right
A	it's like oh the police have enough power to deal with it and should just bloody do it
B	mm
A	the crime isn't happening there
B	yeah that's um what I'm wondering
A	yes
B	to say confiscate
A	drug trafficking
B	yeah
A	well no it wouldn't
B	mm
A	and getting access to their account
