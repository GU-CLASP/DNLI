A	I saw your pictures that you put on the other day on the er the the snow and everything I didn't know
B	mm
A	cos I had to look twice cos I didn't know if you were out there and I thought
B	no
A	I'm sure she's not cos we've just spoken to her
B	yeah no no I wasn't out there I just erm somebody put it on Facebook saying it was snowing in
A	ah
B	and they're saying it's gonna be a really cold winter here so hopefully it will be over there as well
A	oh
B	and then we'll get out there mind you I won't be able to ski I don't think for a while
A	well I was gonna say you're not gonna be able to are you?
B	no no that's the thing cos they put it back three weeks that adds three weeks on the recovery so when I go out it'll it'll be six weeks after the op so
A	right
B	I might be able to potter that's my plan if I can just to see
A	just be careful
B	yeah oh yeah I'm I'm not gonna go mad
A	yeah
B	but
A	is it the après ski? isn't that what they call it? the bar?
B	yeah yeah I'll probably do a lot of that mm yeah because the kids are coming out erm at Christmas with us erm
A	uhu
B	and then
A	oh lovely
B	so yeah mm
A	be nice
B	mm yeah I mean even if I don't get to ski I'm quite happy tucked up with a book
A	ah it'll be lovely
B	yeah it'll be fine
C	this is in the place you bought isn't it?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	so that's good cos there was only a couple of cupboards and this sort of big surface thing to work on and that was about it so we went into Wicks and said we've got a very little space for a very little kitchen you know as in there's only a couple of and we we worked it all out we managed to get quite a lot in and did tall erm cupboards the top one's going right to ceiling
A	mm yeah
B	but so just going round the corner
C	mm
B	so there's gonna be a lot more space so that's good it'll be good
C	that's the problem with ours isn't it?
B	mm
C	we haven't got enough space we need
A	more cupboards
C	we were persuaded against having additional working
A	cupboards
C	by the designer
A	cupboards
B	yeah
C	well
B	yeah
C	er cos he said oh no you want it you want it all you know clean lines and all that stuff
B	yeah
C	but it wasn't very practical in the end we were oh okay then cos we wanted to have a cupboard you know where the the fridge is?
B	mm
C	on the other side and erm
A	regret it
C	regret it
B	yeah
C	cos
A	it's a huge kitchen and we can't really store anything
B	yeah well that's it
A	drives me mad
B	yeah I mean our place er the you know the bungalow we've got no storage anywhere because we knocked out where it was storage as part of the old bungalow and made it into part of a room which carried on back with all the other rooms then
A	yeah
B	so we've got no cupboards we've got obviously not got an under the stairs cupboard or anything like that
A	mm
B	and you find it's the things like where do you put your mop and bucket? and where do you put your hoover? and there used to be a big cupboard in the bathroom in
A	mm
B	that that was the cupboard basically so that's where the the shower is now and all of a sudden where do we put the hoover? where do you put the mop? where do you put this? where do you put?
A	mm
B	and even down to the sheets for your bed and the towels cos they were all in there so you've suddenly got to find room for everything
A	yeah you'll have to have an extension
B	yeah we tried that well we didn't try it since then but yeah
B	no not extending at all really we had to really fight to get what we got we wanted we want
A	cos it's not like it impacts on anybody else cos you don't look over anyone
B	no no
A	and you're low and
B	well they said it would it because it was the same look it
A	yeah
B	then we couldn't change the look of it and we said but we're next to a house
A	but you're going backwards
B	yeah but we're next to a house and if you look all up and down the whole street
A	they're all different anyway
B	it's there's chalet bungalows
A	yeah
B	there's semi-detached there's terraced houses there's detached there's everything all mixed up on that top road
A	oh there is
B	erm and we actually wanted to go up as well not into necessarily a house but up into the roof but actually make it higher
A	yeah
B	so we had the top floor would have been
A	yeah
B	erm en suite and a dressing room sort of idea and then come across and then have the other side as all walk in loft space
A	yeah
B	so we wanted to do all that and they wouldn't let us and
A	oh
B	we wanted to do things with dormer windows and they wouldn't let us because nobody else had them and we found out loads of people had put in for them but they'd all got told no cos nobody else was had had them
A	oh
B	it's like if you'd let us all have them everybody will have one
A	yeah
B	and then they'll all match so
C	funny thing this planning innit?
B	mm
A	you're definitely at the mercy of them
B	mm did you have problems when you were doing the conservatory?
A	no cos we didn't ask for it
B	didn't you?
A	we didn't need well we were told we didn't need it
B	mm
A	because it's to do with the square meterage of floor space
B	yeah
A	and it not being a permanent building
C	and there was already one there wasn't there?
A	and there was one there already yeah
B	oh right yeah so you were sort of replacing something that was already there
A	yeah it was a tad bigger but
B	yeah
A	only by a couple of feet wasn't it really?
B	yeah I remember we we hadn't put in for planning permission and the guy started building it cos ours is goes right across the back doesn't it? if you remember
A	yeah
B	we put in but then
A	mm
C	mm
B	and I went out the back she went oh I see you started building it and I said yes oh did they tell you you didn't need planning permission at first? I went yes she went mm and then somebody said maybe you did I was like yes
A	mm
B	that's that so
A	mm
B	now I mean it's plenty big enough for us now it's just that they made us go in in the middle bit so you've got the bungalow and then it goes in a bit where the dining room and back door is
A	yeah
B	and then it goes back out again and they said that was because you could see it from the road whereas if it went in I think that was again we were just like what? you know so yeah again where we would have maybe put a big cupboard or something
A	yeah
B	we couldn't
C	oh dear so maybe we should have asked for planning permission
B	I don't know
A	I don't know as I said it was there before wasn't there so?
B	things are
A	well we bought the house and it was surveyed and everything things like that get picked up at that point don't they?
B	yeah that's right yeah cos it'll be on the deeds and what you can and can't have
A	yeah
B	so yeah they would've noticed it
A	okay so
B	mm mm
C	oh well we're not moving are we?
A	it's up now it's too late
B	I think they've relaxed quite a lot now on what they'll allow for planning and
B	I think yeah yeah we
C	because of the issues of people not being
B	yeah yeah yeah like you are you
A	no
B	you're
A	we're
B	right okay yeah
A	it's
B	oh is it? I don't know
A	yeah it starts the other side of the road
B	oh okay
A	that's
B	mm cos they're different again to what
A	mm
C	next door's got that they've got a conservatory in the one over the way haven't they? after
A	I was gonna say which way are you going that way? yes they have yeah
C	they've got a conservatory
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and nobody's moaned about it
A	well we don't really interfere with anybody do we? cos it's this side of the the only person would be
C	well it's not cos the flat roof
A	mm
C	that way
A	mm
C	it's this side we're not overlooking anyone are we?
A	no
B	no
A	no we're not
B	been at work today?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yes
B	is that down in
C	driving down driving down the A1 and the four two one

B	have you?
C	so I drive one day
B	yeah
C	he drives another day and then it we're either of us are usually in London then

A	every little helps doesn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah well it's a hundred miles off the
B	yeah
C	off the clock that you don't do
B	yeah and you're not actually having to do the driving which gets tiring as well
C	not doing the driving and it's not costing me any money so
B	yeah mm
A	mm
C	but we're both in London tomorrow
B	yeah
C	which is
B	yeah
A	that'll be nice
B	they say that where I work it's sort of none of the sales team work Fridays because they all say they all work from home on a Friday like yeah work from home idea it's like yeah I'm sure they're very busy
A	are you still at
B	yeah
A	you were looking to get out weren't you at one point?
B	mm thinking about it
A	mm
B	no I'll stay there now I think
A	mm yeah for a while
B	been thinking
A	was that your Linkedin profile had an alarm on it that came up?
B	yeah says it's six years
C	that
B	yeah
A	have you really been there six years?
B	mm
A	have you?
B	yeah
A	blimey
B	yeah I know
A	where did those go?
B	don't ask me no yeah I've been there six years cos I've got a few people sent through
C	er cos
A	oh
C	it was on the same link
A	I got it six months
B	mm
C	have you passed your probation?
A	not yet
C	so is it six months' probation is it?
A	six-month probation yeah
B	mm I think if you were there temporary and then they said stay permanent then there's a fair bit
A	I had to apply for it and go through the the interview process
B	oh right
A	and the stupid tests they made us take
B	yeah
C	what the
A	there were like boxes and you had to move the boxes round and like how many
C	that's a that's a IQ test
B	oh god
A	yeah blimey that was really hard
C	what was your IQ then?
A	I don't know
A	well I thought you saw the thing that came out from it didn't you?
C	that didn't have an IQ on it though?
A	no they were psychometric testing wasn't it? you have to look at them
C	what all those words that came about as a result of you moving boxes around?
A	that and answering questions as well so
C	that was able to tell that you were sort the sort of person you were from
B	yeah
C	how you do boxes and mirror images that's a bit amazing
B	yeah
C	that's true do you not have to answer questions with answers like proper ones?
A	yeah which ones you know it's like are you
C	this
A	in this situation are you more this? or are you more that? or
B	yeah yeah and you have to put in more like this or more like that yeah yeah
A	and you have to do all of that sort of business
B	yeah yeah and that gets the sort of the profile bit doesn't it?
B	yeah
B	I yeah I've had it done in the past and it's
C	what's bob on?
A	bob on
B	Fen talk
C	Fen talk I've never heard of it
A	I don't know where that's come from
B	bob on
A	yeah I know a lot of people that say bob on
A	bob on I think it's
B	mm
C	mm
A	one of these colloquialisms
B	yeah
C	so we had loads of people round didn't we last Saturday?
A	yeah before
B	week before
A	yeah
C	week before has it been two weeks?
B	yeah
A	yep
B	yeah
A	it sure has
B	yeah I saw pictures
C	fortunately it didn't rain for the evening
B	no
C	it rained all day and then it cleared about four o'clock didn't it?
B	mm
C	so we was alright so it was a bit cold but
A	and it was a bit soggy underfoot as well
C	bit soggy
B	yeah
C	but considering it was October
B	mm
A	yeah
C	we did alright
B	yeah
A	mm mm we had a couple of fires outside didn't we?
C	yeah managed not to burn down the fence
B	that's always a good start
C	or the house
B	that's good I
A	they were my sister's cake
B	yeah
A	a little light sponge yeah
C	size of a breeze block
A	oh it was funny cos we hadn't bothered we weren't gonna bother with the cake
B	no no
A	and she said to me a few days before have you got a cake? and I was like nah I'm not gonna bother
B	no
A	I'll make you one
A	bloody thing was enormous
C	I think she was thinking on the base there's gonna be loads of people that'll all want a slice
B	yeah
A	yeah but it all went up rather than out it went up it was this huge tower and it weighed a tonne
C	it was a bit heavy
B	yeah
A	a little light sponge cake
B	yeah nice idea
A	we got a picture out of it didn't we?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yep
A	yes
B	that's really nice actually I cos I saw the picture on erm
C	I don't like it
B	mm yeah
C	and but you think like you are seeing them and you know what they're doing cos you see them on Facebook
B	yeah
C	so it's like you
B	yeah no because you a lot of people put on what they're doing on a day-to-day basis
C	yeah
B	every week or so they put something on they're doing this going there
A	mm
B	so you actually get and get to see like they're having their grandkids and
C	yeah
B	you're actually you're involved in with their life aren't you?
A	yeah
B	whereas normally we'd meet up with people
A	yeah
B	you know and then
C	yeah
B	have a big catch up or you'd ring people
A	mm
B	I used to do that when I first moved to
A	yeah
B	erm and just have a really good catch up you don't do that anymore
A	no
B	you always think you tend to think oh I'll send a text rather than ring somebody you send a text and then you get an answer back at some point and
A	mm
B	it's the personal connection that's gone isn't it?
A	mm when we first got to moved in and we moved to
B	mm
B	yeah
A	with your bag of ten Ps
C	yes
A	feed the
C	it was on the edge of a park which was a bit dodgy
B	yeah
C	so I used to
B	yeah particularly as it's lit up and you're stood there
C	I used to come down and stand outside
A	yeah
B	yeah that's right and you're preoccupied with who you're talking to and what you're doing and yeah next thing you know you've got some
C	and usually you were getting guilt-tripped weren't you?
A	by my mum yeah
B	mm
A	but no funny you know the old phone boxes
B	mm
A	I don't think the kids would know how to use a phone box these days I don't know if there is any
B	no there's not many now
C	there's still a few not many not many of the old ones like the red ones
B	no
C	you don't see that you only
A	mm
B	yeah
C	er villages don't you?
B	mm
C	sort of like all the preservation orders they've got on them
B	mm
C	but no it's funny cos they all all the people in the village oh got to keep their phone box and they have
B	yeah
C	they have big preservation order to keep it keep it red
B	mm
C	and all that and nobody uses it
A	no
C	but nobody uses landlines anymore
B	no
A	not very often
B	trying to tell you that the erm the government have got a scheme and you can have a boiler when you get your PPI money you won't even need to spend that will you?
C	yeah
A	the advantages of being ex-directory
B	oh we are and and we're telephone preference service as well
C	but you still get them?
A	and do you still get them?
B	oh yeah we get them
C	we don't get many
A	no we not on the landline I get them on the mobile
B	we get it's the recorded delivery the recorded messages now that we get and it there's one that we seem to be stuck on and they ring the fax number first and then literally about four minutes later it rings ours so you know to ignore it the fax nothing happens but then the main phone one goes and I just leave it and it always cuts into the same sort of point government scheme which says you can borrow on PPI not PPI government scheme for new boiler and and you can't get hold of it you can't do anything and find out who it is or try and block it because it just comes up it's international or withheld
A	mm
B	or it's something like that
C	I had a guy ring me up the other day at on my mobile
B	yeah
C	on my work mobile whilst I was at work and said it rang and I went hello and there was silence and then obviously cos it's one of these diallers isn't it?
A	and wait for the call centre
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and then
B	yeah
C	he goes hello and he goes he goes I'm calling about your PPI
B	uhu
C	got a PPI I said er can I ask where you've got this number from?
B	yeah
C	and he goes erm well I got this number from er er there we have a a
B	yeah
C	and and he said he said well I just need to take your details sir but you're telling me I've got a PPI claim?
B	yeah
C	so how do you know that? well I I er I said oh you must know so you don't know then?
B	mm
C	so you don't know who I am so how have you got hold of this number?
B	mm
C	so he goes er and he goes so why are you calling me? I just basically took the mickey out of him for about ten minutes
B	yes yeah
B	yeah
C	and got him more and more annoyed
C	and then in the end I just hung up
B	yeah
C	I took a leaf out my dad's book he does that
A	yeah your dad does that all the time doesn't he?
C	can I ask where you happen to have got my? do you realise that's a breach of the Data Protection Act?
B	yeah
C	my son works for the insurance fraud bureau you know he keeps wheeling that one out
B	yeah yeah no exactly no
C	yes exactly works for the insurance fraud people
B	yeah
C	oh dear
A	no I only get them on my mobile we haven't so far we don't
C	the only person that rings you on the landline
A	is my mother
C	is your mother
A	yeah
B	yeah my mum rings me on the landline
C	yeah my mum mum rings on
B	from her landline
C	the landline I use it to ring my mum and that's about it
A	mm
B	my mum rings me on the mobile on her mobile and says oh hello I haven't got many minutes can you ring me back? and I think who's the mother and who's the child you know? it's normally kids who ring and go I've got no credit and
A	it's usually the other way round
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah exactly
C	just say change your plan then
B	that's what I've said to her but oh well no that's too much hassle and it's not very much a month and it's like you could quite easily get oh no no no
B	okay worse than that she'll chat to you for a minute on it and then she'll go I've got to go cos I'm saving my minutes because I know
B	oh it's funny
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so she'll go she'll sort of go oh hang on I've gotta go we're on fifty-eight minutes hang on
B	and then rings you back
A	and then she rings back right so de de de de de de
A	but yeah no I speak to
B	mm I think you have to have the
C	yeah there was a thing I read on this is on Linkedin again erm it said five things not to put on your résumé
B	right
C	cos obviously it was American
B	yeah
C	and the first thing was you don't put your erm don't put your address
B	mm
C	on your résumé
B	mm
C	it's not necessary
B	yeah
C	and also they will economically profile you
A	they'll see where you live
C	and see so whether they want that sort of person who lives in a neighbourhood like that they don't want
C	erm the next thing was you don't put erm
B	mm
C	because that's
B	oh right
C	so if you've got an AOL dot com
B	yeah
C	it was saying or or any other cable provider serving like BT
A	BT
C	yeah right so I'm thinking so yeah I put my address on there I put my email and then the other one was oh and the other reason for the address was they
A	mm mm
B	yeah
C	the place and then rule you out from a commuting point of view
B	mm mm
C	erm the email address oh the double the double
B	yeah
A	oh right
C	cos they don't
A	don't put them in?
C	don't put them in because that's something that we had a big row about this at work the other day yeah
A	I thought you were supposed to
C	yes so I I'm sitting there so so
B	yeah mm
C	and erm I looked up we've got an
B	yeah
A	yeah how you do it yeah
B	mm
C	and in there it's a bloody single space innit right?
B	yeah
C	it's all single spaced ah I don't so I looked it up on I googled it
B	mm
C	and I looked it up
B	mm
C	and it's the French spacing there's actually all different terms for all these different styles
A	oh
C	and apparently it's it's to do with
B	yeah
A	right
C	it's going out of fashion
A	ah
B	yeah
C	and by having two spaces after a full stop before you type your next letter
B	mm you show your age
C	you're showing your age
B	yeah
C	or showing that you were trained to type on
B	see I was never type
C	on a typewriter
B	I've never done double spacing
A	I've only done it because just through the college courses and stuff and them and them saying this is how
C	yeah and it's something that they teach in universities
A	yeah in university how to do your
C	yeah in universities essay writing
A	yeah
C	is apparently something they teach
A	double spacing yeah
B	mm
C	but it's not it's apparently going out of
A	mm
C	phase erm but that's
B	yea
C	so email double something I do double spacing
B	address email and double spacing
C	okay so that's three and then what was the other ones?
B	oh don't put a landline
C	landline
B	yeah
C	that's what led me to
B	yeah
C	yeah landline who has a landline anymore? that's a definite sign you're old if you've got a landline
A	but like you said you have to have a landline now to have broadband
B	yeah but you don't expect people to phone you on it
A	er I suppose
C	and the other one was erm to do with your skillsets but I can't quite remember how that was but it was the way you write
B	mm
C	what your skills are but it's like you know you shouldn't be putting these things on cos it
B	mm
C	you don't put your age on
A	no
B	no
C	but that it screams how old you are based on the fact that you've provided a cable provided email address so it said if you've got a cable one get it redirected to a Gmail account
A	but they can work out how old you are
B	yeah no Hotmail yeah that's erm
A	was a no no
B	I don't yeah I think there's Hotmail that is
C	yeah you see I I
B	sort of scam things isn't it? and you get loads of Hotmail accounts and stuff but I think it's probably quite trendy
A	yeah touch wood I've not had any scams so
B	mm
C	have you heard of a guy called Alan Turing?
A	yes
C	he's the guy that invented the computer
A	computer yeah
A	yeah
C	at the moment which is
A	just about to come out
C	stars
A	mm he killed himself
C	and he killed he ah well this is the thing we were talking about this at work
A	or was he knocked off?
C	he killed himself he killed himself by eating a pie an apple laced with cyanide right?
B	mm
C	and when he was found he was found in bed and there was a half-eaten apple by the side of his bed
B	mm
C	and the
B	and the half-eaten apple means
B	yeah yeah
C	and I was sitting there at work and then
B	mm
A	oh right yeah
C	which is a half-eaten apple is is a tribute
A	to him?
C	to Alan Turing
B	oh right oh as in
C	yeah you know the apple
B	I was
C	no no Apple computers
B	oh right
C	Apple computers
B	oh right
C	right? so I went is that right? and so I looked it up so I looked up Alan Turing and apparently he
B	yeah
C	in bed next to a half-eaten apple
B	yeah
C	so at the time there was this speculation that that's what happened but there's been a loads of stuff since saying suggesting that actually he
B	oh mm
C	but apparently at the time he he the way he was with people he was kind of yeah whatever he wasn't bothered about it
B	right
C	and he was remarkably cheerful in the two or three days before he was fine and then on the
B	yeah
C	the cos it was a Bank Holiday weekend he put in a list of everything he was going to do the following week he left it on his desk
B	mm
C	which was his habit to do
A	ah so was he bumped off then?
C	apparently he always er he always ate an apple before he went to bed
B	yeah yeah
C	and often he left it half-eaten right?
A	oh right
B	oh
C	when they examined the body it wasn't the impression was that it wasn't a sudden
B	mm
C	it was gradual and apparently he was a bugger for doing experiments at home chemical experiments
A	oh right
C	and he was doing plating and there was
B	oh no yeah
C	he inhaled it it was an accident
A	ah it was an accident
B	yeah
C	he didn't actually
B	mm
C	he didn't kill himself
A	I was going to say it's a conspiracy somebody actually in the secret service bumped him off or something
C	no no they reckon
C	no no not not at all so
A	did you find out whether the Apple logo is because of that?
C	well so then I looked
A	mm
B	yeah
C	which obviously isn't always true but it said that erm
A	must be it's Wikipedia
B	yeah
C	he was asked erm you know that er oh what's his name? what's the guy? Stephen Fry
B	mm
C	asked
B	mm
C	said and asked him is that is it true? this rumour that
A	mm
C	and Steve Jobs turned round and said god I wish it was
B	mm
A	oh right
C	but it was an accident it was
A	it was a coincidence
C	it was pure coincidence
B	mm
A	but it's a good
C	but it's a good little erm
B	yeah
C	story though
B	but then if Steve Jobs had said yes it is then surely the descendants of matey would have said we want some royalties for using our logo
A	want some money yeah
B	and it's trademarked and
C	I don't know if he had any descendants
B	no?
C	cos he wasn't married cos he was gay
B	yeah
C	didn't have any kids
A	he might have had
C	yeah but they're not his descendants are they?
B	no but they would have been an an heir wouldn't they?
A	well family

C	I wouldn't mind that that job
B	oh yeah no that and I'd like that
C	I bet you I bet you that's a bit of a grind though
A	mm
B	mm
C	it's it's like a lot of things innit it's it's only interesting for a certain amount of time
B	yeah
A	yeah it's such
C	but the internet is an amazing thing for that what you can find out
B	mm
C	and what you can do
A	definitely
B	yeah
C	do you remember that the guy I erm that aeroplane?
A	mm
C	so when I was in the air cadets
B	yeah
C	flew a little have I
B	I'll tell you if you have when I get to a bit I remember
C	alright so
C	an aeroplane erm called a Chipmunk which was a little training aeroplane this was back in the eighties ninety early eighties
B	right
C	and these were really old aeroplanes then and it was down at
B	mm
C	and it's etched in my
B	yeah
C	and erm when you you get a little book when you're in the cadets a little book of all your things that you do you record everything
B	mm
C	wherever you go and it's like a little flight log in there so you can record all your flights
B	mm
C	three eight double two it's called it's a little book and I've still got mine and then
B	yeah
C	he obviously had his and said and I will show you my little three eight two so I pulled this book out and I was looking at all the different this and I
B	yeah
C	I wonder if it got scrapped cos they all got scrapped in the in the mid-nineties they retired them all sold them all off privately
B	right
C	so I knew that much so I wonder if they're wonder what they did with it and I just started looking on the internet and I
B	yeah
C	erm the
C	has spent hours and hours listing every single type but going back yonks
B	yeah
C	we're talking back into the nineteen thirties and ridiculously old
B	yeah goodness
C	so I thought oh blimey so I I said type
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah paid off nineteen ninety-six de de de er sold to and then it had erm or re-registered USA and it had a number
B	mm
C	which was the American
B	right yeah
C	I thought bloody hell it went to a it's gone to an American it's been re-registered in America
B	mm
C	I wonder what happened to that I wonder if there's a website like this in for America
C	so I went Federal Aviation Authority like
B	yeah
C	Aircraft Registrations to put that it in
B	yeah
C	and I
B	mm
C	and and it gave a town
C	so and this do you remember?
A	I do yeah
C	it took me about three hours
B	really? yeah
C	but I I ended up going from I wonder what happened to that aeroplane to
B	yeah
C	knowing it was at a certain airport
B	mm
C	it was owned by a lawyer
B	right
C	an attorney
B	yeah
C	I knew where he lived I had a picture of him
B	well was it was it a cable provider?
A	yeah
C	probably so no it was his law firm address cos he was an attorney of law
B	yeah
C	and obviously on the I found the business
B	yeah
C	the business had a website and that's where I found his picture he was on there
A	mm
A	can't remember
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	dah de dah de dah blah blah blah and I said I'd love to see some pictures if you've got a picture of it that'd be great
B	yeah
C	and he wrote back to me and
B	ah
C	said it was in an air-conditioned hangar in in er
B	mm
C	and it's it's a real popular aeroplane on the on the
B	yeah
C	takes it off and does airshows with it all over the place erm he said I'm looking for some cadet memorabilia if you've got anything like that so I sent him a load of PDF
B	copies of yeah yeah
C	files of old posters and stuff from which he could he could obviously get printed off
B	yeah
C	but I think he got the impression I was a pilot cos the way he was talking to he's
B	oh right cos you said I flew your plane
C	I
B	yeah
C	was in your plane I think he thought I actually flew it
B	yeah
C	he said you'll have to come over when you come over you can take her up and
C	I don't
B	yeah which which do you press to start the engine again?
C	and he's teaching his he's teaching his son to fly and he sent me three pictures of him and his lad
B	mm
A	oh
C	so the only thing he'd done he'd put in a a
B	mm
C	which was required under their regulations he said everything else is
B	mm
C	all original even the paintwork and it looks just like I remembered it
B	yeah
C	and then the weirdest thing was I went I went I was telling people about this at the squadron
B	yeah
C	and in the mess there's a big picture an oil painting of a Chipmunk that the CO who was the CO when I was a cadet back in the eighties
B	mm
C	when he left he presented that to the squadron
B	right
C	and it was he'd got it commissioned it was an original oil painting
B	yeah
C	of a Chipmunk in flight and the bloody serial number on his er plane is the same plane
B	wow
C	how weird is that? it was spooky wasn't it? like
A	yeah
C	that's
B	I thought you were going say that
A	was the same
B	was the same one as it had ended up being somewhere and yeah
A	no
B	yeah you had told me no you hadn't told me before really
C	I must have bored a few people with that story
B	mm
A	you don't bore people
B	no you don't bore people

B	yeah
A	four and a half hours and
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah I must admit I've been watching all her her calamities
A	makes me anxious
B	I loved your comment though when she said about erm she wasn't feeling very well and you said something about it being uni flu or freshers' flu
A	freshers' flu yeah go running home
B	yeah gargle with alcohol
B	I thought that was brilliant
A	yeah they well know that when they they have freshers' week
B	yeah
A	they they all come down with what's
B	yeah yeah
A	and it's because they're not sleeping they're drinking a lot
B	yeah yeah
A	their diet's rubbish
B	yeah
A	and you're suddenly in close proximity
B	yeah
A	with people that you haven't so the germs come in
C	and they all come out
A	and they all go down they all go down with colds
B	yeah well it's like when they start school isn't it?
A	mm
B	the the
A	it's a herd thing isn't it?
B	yeah this is it yeah yeah
A	so yeah so yeah she she went down with that but yeah then her her back sort of kind of overtook her and her feet
B	yeah she's
C	she's a hypochondriac
A	she's on the right course
B	yeah yeah
A	oh yes
C	the drama queen
A	oh yes
B	yeah that's the same as
A	oh god
B	yeah
A	yeah it's er saying that but no he's he's enjoying he's doing the foam parties and clubbing and drinking and
B	mm
A	he was a bit hungover he was like four o'clock in the morning
C	yeah he wasn't exactly the brightest he's been
A	he said
A	so yeah bless him
B	mm
A	but I'm glad he is cos when he when he went off I said to him
B	no no no no
A	this is the only time you'll do this
B	yeah let your hair down
A	forget it let your hair down be a child go with it
B	oh yeah
A	and he's kind of taken it on board
B	yeah yeah you can never tell he's your son at all my dear I can never remember you doing anything like that
A	well cos you know neither of them really drank
B	no
A	at all he didn't
B	no
A	you know and I had I had to give
B	mm
A	erm when she
B	yeah
A	have a good time I said but
B	mm
A	just remember you are not used to drinking
B	no
A	so you can't drink a couple of bottles of wine and some loads of
B	yeah
A	cos your body is not used to it
B	or be in a situation you really don't want to be in because you can't you don't know what's happening and the next day you're thinking did something happen?
A	yeah
B	you know yeah it's yeah
A	so you know I said you just need to be careful
B	yeah
A	you know to get to that level you have to kind of ease into it
B	yeah ease yourself in gently
A	yeah
B	this is how you do it
A	so but she hasn't but I think it
B	yeah
A	but she's not drank enough and she didn't drink for nearly a week after that little episode
B	yeah I mean I I
A	yeah
B	oh say thank you to I can't remember who to say thank you to I can't remember what he looks like
A	so I think it sort of spooked her enough
B	yeah
A	that she's er she's not really I'm sure she she is drinking but she's not drinking to that point
B	I think yeah I think most kids at somewhere between fourteen and twenty-four have that one time when they get so drunk that they are so ill and that actually does make them stop and think it doesn't mean they're not gonna get drunk doesn't mean they're not gonna get hangovers or be sick again or anything but they're actually just a little bit aware of you can't just throw it constantly down your throat cos actually your body's gonna go er no
A	I've had enough now
B	yeah had enough yeah
A	but yes
B	mm
A	but she she's home October
B	got half-term
A	half-term yeah they've got a reading week there's only her course and another course out of the whole uni that have got the a reading week
B	okay
A	and most of them the others who although although they've got reading weeks they they're not allowed to leave the uni
B	really?
A	whereas she her course have been allowed to leave
B	yeah
A	so she's coming home
B	you would've thought half-term they would have let people go
A	well a lot of unis don't have half-terms
B	oh don't they?
A	no it's not something
B	oh right oh they have longer Christmas breaks and Easter breaks then yeah
A	yeah she's
B	yeah
A	whatever it is eleventh I think it is
B	mm
A	erm so she'll come home on the twelfth of December and then she doesn't go back until I think they've got like four weeks
B	yeah
A	something like that so
B	suppose it makes sense cos people are coming from all over so to be going backwards and forwards for half-term and this holiday that holiday it makes sense to have a longer break
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but er so no she's she's coming back but I won't see her cos I'm away
B	oh right? where are you doing?
A	I'm going to
B	are you? god I spent my teenage years gowing up there
A	Costa Costa Skeg
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah it's a lot better than Skeggy
A	oh it's lovely actually
B	yeah
A	it really is lovely and the beach there is gorgeous

B	yeah
A	what all day? what? pretty much
B	yeah

B	yeah exactly
A	and we do have a scream we have a ball
B	yeah mm
A	but yeah mainly sew
B	yeah
C	you should
A	oh no you'd never no you cos the whole tape you'd just be a cacophony of noise
B	just cackling
A	yeah and a lot of cackling yeah
A	yeah cos we come from all over
C	think of the hours you'd get though
B	yeah
A	you'd get a lot of hours
A	well me and
B	mm so are these people that you know that you've got together with or people that have joined club and that's how you've got to know them?
A	it's kind of
A	I I know them through
B	yeah
A	and it's been erm
B	mm
A	and some of them have come because they know other people that have joined sewing groups
B	yeah
A	or they've known them via other groups
B	yeah
A	that they've joined the the two ladies from
B	yeah
A	they met erm years ago
B	mm
A	and it's part of you know someone so I'm gonna bring my friend along and that
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and that's how we've we've all kind of get together so we don't really see each other a lot
B	no
A	just when we go away and it's
B	how many of you are going?
A	there's eight of us
B	yeah
A	that go erm we used to be part of a bigger group and it got up to about fifteen
B	mm
A	but it was too many and they start getting
B	yeah
A	you know factions and then there's little cliques and then they start getting bitchy and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it just got all too much
B	no
A	you know it took away the fun
B	mm yeah
A	of doing it so
C	just got rid of all the bitchy people
A	so a few of us went
B	yeah
A	well let's do it ourselves and start again
B	yeah
A	but we'd made a a a decision that it will be the eight and only the eight
C	yeah
A	and if any others come because they're going away again in March
B	mm
A	I can't go for the whole time
B	yeah
A	erm but they're not gonna like put somebody whereas the other group
B	no
A	would put somebody else in oh my friend'll come great you know whereas this one it's like
B	yeah so you've got the set people
A	we either all go or
B	yeah
A	it'll be however many can go
B	yeah that's nice yeah
A	so we don't erm
A	mm
B	go and do something erm she was saying round us all up and stuff and I said
A	mm
B	well yeah but she said not this year
A	yeah
B	but maybe next year look at doing something
A	yeah is she alright? I haven't seen her for ages
B	yeah
A	I see her pictures on Facebook and I keep
B	I know yeah you keep looking yeah
A	I stalk her on Facebook every now and again but other than that I've not
B	yeah yeah erm she's been sent down to be tested to see if she's eligible or suitable for erm it's it's something it's like a spinal erm
A	mm
B	er to the spinal column and should help her with all the pain and the problems she's getting but erm the doctor that's recommended her to go down for it has said I don't know at all if you're eligible but some of the things that we've got here look like that sort of thing they the that is known to help but you if you go down and get assessed it may be just no or it may be something
A	right
B	and then you have to look and think if you want to have it done
A	yeah
B	erm so she's gonna go that's
A	oh right
B	yeah and she's erm
A	oh right is she? oh bless her
B	yeah having problems with that so she's been a bit but she's lost loads of weight she's sort of she put a load on again I mean the drugs don't help her cos she has to take
A	I was gonna say yeah she takes a lot of drugs doesn't she bless her?
B	she takes so many yeah erm but then she gets as soon as she gets back on Slimming World and she just started doing all that again and
A	yeah
B	she's lost a lot of weight again but
A	cos that'll make a lot of difference to her back
B	mm
A	but if you're taking the drugs it's difficult
B	yeah I think she struggles a bit to be honest
A	yeah oh bless her
B	but yeah
A	mm so
B	no
B	no no because erm
B	yeah yeah
A	you know that horrible miserable part in the
B	yeah end up doing doing something
A	yeah
B	trouble is though
B	but once we get through the spring thing we will
A	mm
B	I said that to
A	mm mm
B	erm and he's done a I mean he might be back Saturday he's not sure if he's even gonna be back this weekend and the next few weekends so normally I'd do it end of November cos everyone gets December gets busy
A	yeah
B	and I usually say right let's have this meal and do
A	mm
B	but he's probably not gonna be here well he won't be here so there's no point
A	no no
B	no point doing it and there's December he's away first week in erm a course in Manchester
A	mm mm
B	and then he's here for a week then but he's working at
A	right
B	er stuff to take out and getting everything
A	yeah does he drive out then or?
B	yeah he's gonna go out er with two mates they've gone out a couple of times with him erm
A	takes a while to get there though doesn't it? cos it's well right
B	yeah it's about eleven or twelve hours door to door that's on Eurostar but we've got one of them that one of the guys that goes out we've got him on the insurance
A	right
B	for the van so they take it in turns for driving
A	oh that's alright then
B	and then erm yeah we'll drive back we'll probably leave the van out there all season we we might do
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure we left it out for a while last time
A	yeah
B	and then just flew back and left it
B	yeah and drive it back again
A	yeah
B	but then you sort of think oh you know obviously
A	mm
B	so we're umming and ahhing whether to get a vehicle out there but it's all the expense of a second vehicle do we do that or do we just keep that out there I don't know
A	I don't suppose hiring for all a long time
B	no that would be quite expensive really
A	yeah
B	so
A	not really not really snowing
B	no
C	not really a snow car is it?
B	no exactly no
A	it's a sunny car that one
B	yeah it is yeah so I don't know we'll see I mean last year we took it out and we left it out there for quite a while
A	yeah
B	flew back and forth and then just took it back again
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	whereas this year I think he's gonna be busier whereas I'm I'm planning to get out at weekends even if he's not gonna be around I my plan is I'm gonna get out there and do weekends
A	mm
B	anyway
A	mm
B	erm and then he'll come out or I'll stay out for a week and then he'll come out and join me
C	is it all is it all sorted now you said you've done the kitchen and is there much more to do?
B	erm yeah well the bathroom I think we we're umming and ahhing about doing that cos we'd quite like to get a washing machine in there
A	mm
B	otherwise we have to go down to the laundrette at the bottom erm
A	I've seen you've got a little
B	yeah
A	even if it's only a little one cos you get small ones can't you?
B	yeah yeah that's it but it's just umming and ahhing how to do it cos there's a a shower over the bath but it's a really really good shower so at the moment we're thinking we're not gonna change that that'll be probably next summer if we're going to do something
A	yeah
B	we'll do that we want to put some wood flooring or something down but again we we haven't done that yet and we're gonna wait and see and decide what we're doing
A	mm
B	we need to change the heating there erm so there's a few bits and bobs really and paint it through but that again will probably spring time after it
A	I was gonna say you need to do that when the
B	yeah yeah this is it
A	ah lovely
B	mm mm mm
A	what's up with you? feed me I'm starving
C	he looks like a starving cat doesn't he?
A	yeah he does doesn't he?
B	he's wasting away
A	mm
B	yeah
A	she settled alright?
B	sorry?
A	she settled alright?
B	yeah yeah really enjoys it erm gets on really well with all the team et cetera erm and her boss actually said to her a few weeks back there's going to be some deputy EO positions coming up
A	oh right
B	I'm just telling you now so you can be ready I I recommend you go for it I think you you'd be really good and
A	uhu
B	so she just put in for that there's four or five positions
A	oh excellent
B	so she's just applied and shown an interest in that
C	excellent
B	but what she says she wants to do she doesn't want to end up being an EO like team leader
A	mm
B	but she's quite happy to do the deputy side but she wants to get into she said there's there's like the fraud department
A	mm
B	which she said looks really interesting
A	mm
B	when they did the
A	mm
B	so she but she said that looked really good so for her she said she'll try and get this deputy thing do that for a while and then from that look at going into
A	mm
B	you know one of the other departments
C	fraud
B	yeah that's it she said that looks really interesting and that
A	mm
B	looking and checking and sorting and et cetera so
A	no plans to move out then? she's happy
B	no no no why would why would she want to go anywhere? as she keeps saying to
A	mm
B	there's people that I know would just want to have bit of fun but I'm not interested in that
A	mm
B	she said at some point I'll meet someone and hopefully that'll be the person I'll settle with we'll have a relationship and that'll be that if it doesn't work then you know somebody else will but she said I'm not gonna jump about but she said as and when I'm with somebody then I'd see we will get a place together and until then she said I don't want to move out I'm quite happy and I suppose that's fair enough you know
A	ah cool
B	fair enough when you draw your pension we'll tell you maybe then you should have gone by now but
C	mm
A	when she draws her pension she'll be looking after you
B	to be fair
A	yeah
B	you know and and
A	yeah
B	and she's she's quite happy flying round doing all her skating and
A	yes yes
B	yeah skating work and and cos where she's working it's flexi time so that works for her ideal
A	yeah
B	she'll get up in the morning go and have a skating lesson at seven and finishes at eight and rather than having to rush off and get to work for quarter to nine like she used to
A	yeah
B	she might think actually I'm gonna stay on for another half an hour to an hour and and finish and then go into work a bit later
A	right
B	or she can think alright I've had enough now and just go straight into work so
A	yeah
B	she said it it works really well
A	excellent
B	it works really well
A	brilliant
B	mm
A	I'm glad she's got the skating anyway
B	yeah yeah she's a she's a
A	is she still doing erm erm
B	Rainbows?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she doesn't like doing all the admin side that's not her at all
A	no they're a pain a hassle
B	yeah erm and she's always struggling to
A	yeah
B	you get the young leaders which are fine but you know like
A	yeah
B	they're going off to uni you get them
A	yeah yeah
B	for that little
A	yeah
B	yeah what they're doing and that's fine and and she just has this huge waiting list because there's not one in
A	no so there's not many about is there?
B	no and she said most of the girls are from
A	oh right
B	erm yeah but she says it's phases there were most from
A	mm
B	and now it's loads from
A	yeah
B	she does enjoy doing it every time she sort of says about oh I might stop doing it and
A	mm
B	but then she sort of says but not yet cos I do enjoy doing it and
A	yeah
B	yeah so she does
A	cool
B	oh yeah she does
C	you know when you've had enough of doing that sort thing
B	yeah it's like you with the cadets wasn't it? you
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	although I might be going back mightn't I?
A	yeah but you're not gonna go back as a
C	no
A	squadron officer that's what I was looking for
B	yeah
A	don't go out
B	he said no I'm just sat looking through the window
A	no he does that yeah
A	it's when it's raining I'll open the door and he'll look out of it
A	and he'll go I'm not going out and he'll go to a different door and it's like it's raining outside of that one as well as this one
C	I dunno I I was talking to
B	yeah
C	erm and but I've
B	yeah
C	and I do get a lot out of it
B	mm
C	erm
B	yeah
C	I just emailed the guy who's in charge of of the area the wing and said I'm interested in coming back I don't want to be a squadron CO I've done that for five years thanks
B	no yeah
C	did quite well
B	mm mm
C	but
B	yeah
C	so that kind of
B	no
C	but I said I could do you know but that restricts me really to fifty-one which is the
B	yeah
C	or at a push possibly
B	mm
C	five eleven which I know the lady that's running that one is
B	mm
C	so that might be a possibility so I could go there I said or if you if you wanted me to do something at wing level which is like a a more of a staff post
B	mm
C	and it's more likely to be
B	yeah the timing it yeah
C	and it's more likely to be weekends
B	cos you'd probably struggle with that yeah
C	than it is
B	yeah
C	evenings so
B	yeah
C	but I
B	mm
C	so we're meeting on Wednesday
B	yeah
C	and we'll have a chat I'll see what he's got to say really
B	yeah
C	I I said that
A	you quite like the training role though wouldn't you?
C	yeah I would cos there's there's a training team
A	mm
C	and doing something with the training team would probably be good cos that's down at
A	yeah
C	which is where they're based now and so but that's not too far away
A	no
C	that's only about forty-five minutes erm and at the weekend that wouldn't be a problem
B	mm that's it if you go and say the ideas of what you want to do I I think if you started doing just going in as some sort of officer er to somewhere once a week I think cos you'd actually run one you'd either you'd be seeing how things are doing you'd you'd be almost like stepping up without meaning to because you're so used to doing it
C	I think you're right
B	and you've got the once a week every single night you have to be back from
A	oh
C	have you been coaching her?
B	has
A	I haven't I haven't said a word and I haven't said had this conversation with
B	no
C	well you're right you're right
A	it's that expectation as well because he's been so
C	that expectation
A	you know the success he had before maybe
B	mm
C	I've been successful
A	looking at you doing it with them
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	they'll be thinking oh wow we've got
B	yeah
C	wing field champions and
B	yeah
C	this champions and that
B	yeah
C	erm and
B	no and also
C	or or I'll go somewhere and they'll go oh he's arrived so you can take over now erm or
B	yeah
C	they'll be so so crap that it that I'll feel compelled to do it
B	yeah
C	cos it's so shit
B	or you can have somebody sort of keeping it all to themselves and not letting you get involved as in no no no I'm running this and almost like
C	well yeah
B	yeah
C	I don't I yeah I I don't think that would happen so I'm not cos there
A	no
C	as I say there's a limit on the the squadrons I could do anyway I mean the other thought was I could in theory go to a squadron that's local to where I'm working
A	right
C	but then
A	different wing though is it?
C	no no it's
A	oh same wing is it?
A	yeah
B	all those places round there so
B	if if you're doing something once a week on a week night that means you've got to be in a certain place by a certain time
A	mm
C	yeah
B	whether that's more local to here
C	and also that makes you you have a long day then don't you? cos you don't get any break at all which
A	yeah no
C	you know if I if I was doing that I'd be going to work in the morning working all day and then
B	mm
C	staying late because it doesn't start till seven then going to where you would go er it'd be like on the way home let's say it was
B	mm yeah yeah
C	cos there's a squadron there or
B	mm
C	which is near the
B	mm
C	erm
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and then I'd I I kind of get the impression that I'd get bored I'd get fed up with that pretty quick
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and also if if that particular day like you say
A	mm
C	I've got to be in London I've got to go somewhere else with work
B	yeah
C	then I'm not doing it at all so
B	no
C	how's that gonna work out? so I the I I'm er I'm more attracted to and I'm hoping he wants me to do something at a more senior level in
B	yeah
C	in the wing training team or
A	yeah mm
B	well the thing is is if you go
C	yeah yeah
B	but rather than get stuck into a squadron somewhere and be doing something that actually you're gonna end up in a year or or
C	yeah exactly yeah
B	yeah just wait you know you've got Christmas and
C	well I've said I'm I've said it won't be until New Year anyway
B	yeah
C	I don't want to come back now
B	no
C	so it'll be in the New Year
B	cos you need to go and buy all
A	it is
C	yes absolutely
A	takes him hours
C	erm
A	mm
C	I don't know
B	mm
C	I could go to Cyprus couldn't I?
B	are there cadets in Cyprus?
A	they went out to erm Ascension Islands as well didn't they?
C	yeah but you have to be special to get out there
A	well if you're on wing
B	oh
C	I'm not that special
C	I'm like a hill climber
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you have to be one of the A T crowd
A	are you not one of the?
C	no
A	the in crowd
C	but erm
B	you'll have to see what comes to you
C	it's funny like this time last year
B	mm
C	well why would I want to do that? couldn't see it
A	well it's what suits you at what
C	at the time
A	at the time isn't it really?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	so
C	so we'll see
B	mm
A	mm
C	but I do miss it what I you know as somebody was saying to me that you you know do you are you missing it? I don't I miss the social side of it you know the fact that you er you
A	mm
C	become your mates so you've got this group of people you know
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and then you're not seeing them anymore
B	yeah yeah
C	so I miss that I miss the
B	mm
C	they do they are so energising some of them
B	mm
A	mm
C	and they're so full of
A	yeah
C	it does make you it does cheer you up you'd have to be a real miserable git not to
A	mm
B	mm
C	not to get cheered up by them
B	mm
A	mm
C	flying in helicopters
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	sitting in
C	erm playing with guns
B	mm
C	all that sort of stuff not so sure about that camping under a canvas sheet in a bush
A	no you never were very fond of that one was you?
C	not really into that whole green thing
A	how to survive with a billy can
C	yeah you see that
A	a plastic thin bag
A	survival
C	survive the weekend feel the pressure
B	yeah
C	sort of like erm
B	yeah
C	boil in a bag rice and in your billy can
C	but it's all really cold
A	you preferred four star hotels four poster bed
C	yeah that's who it is
A	white linen sheets and a
C	no if I have to be anywhere I'll do it
A	and a three course meal served to you with a bottle of wine
B	oh yeah
C	if I had to
C	I mean that's bad enough the beds aren't very nice in that place the mattresses are very thin they're usually collapsed you know
C	so and they're very spartan
B	food's good though
C	the transit accommodation is pretty pretty rubbish in those places
B	mm
C	but yeah the food's alright
C	and the bar's good bar's always good
B	yeah
C	and the bar is incredibly cheap
B	mm
C	I'll have a pint of beer my man
B	mm
C	that'll be eighty pence please really?
B	yeah
B	I'm trying to remember where we went we went to a ball
C	no
B	no
C	it's
B	we had the mess bar but it you sort of going up and
C	yeah
A	mm
B	just as we went like that and it was a case of going up there and ordering brum brum brum brum brum brum brum and then it was
C	cheap yeah
B	sort of four
C	four pound fifty please
B	four pound something and then
B	and then he kept being again and every time he went it was a different price that was the other thing as well
B	it went up and down a bit for the same round of drinks each time it was either fifty P more or
C	I was gonna say and what does you
B	yeah
C	you went and flew in the Dakota
B	oh yes I went and flew in a Dakota
C	at the Britain
B	I did yes
C	and I was very jealous
A	he went home the other day didn't he?
C	I was very jealous
B	yeah yeah a lot of people were
C	no no
B	a lot of people are
A	mm
C	I've been in the Dakota
B	yeah
C	and sat in the cockpit
B	yeah
C	but I've not actually flown it
B	no we went up to the cockpit when it was flying we were just going over
C	yeah
A	oh wow
B	and I was like going oh look there's
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and it went under the other wing and that was because the erm the people the family of the guy that flies the Spitfire they were actually on the the sortie that we were on
A	oh
B	so that was why he
C	lucky lucky
B	oh I tell you it was
C	yeah we've done that
A	yeah we did that in
B	mm
C	yeah
A	taking photos and stuff
B	yeah we could've gone in that and looked but because it was all set up ready to fly
A	ah
B	but I'm like can I just touch it? can I can I can I just touch it? and that was with you you remember
A	yes yeah
B	yeah cos
A	yeah
B	engineer or whatever so yeah it was a open day at RAF
A	mm
B	and stands and stalls but the people that were with the Battle of Britain memorial people were in that separate bit
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and nobody else was allowed to come through that apart from us so we were all in there and we were the ones that were allowed to go and have the flights in the Dakota
A	mm wow
B	and we had erm like they were doing tours round
A	mm
B	inside the hangar with all the the planes but obviously
A	yeah we we were lucky weren't we? with the cadets we got up close and personal
C	yes yeah
A	we'd be on the other side of the rope
B	yeah yeah that's it
A	all the public were behind the rope and we were this side of it
B	yeah
C	it was quite cool yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	all the cadets were allowed to go
B	well exactly yeah I
A	it's who you know isn't it?
B	it was humbling really was cos you're sat there all strapped in and we they'd got the headphones for some of us so that the you know
A	yeah
B	go and listen to the headphones you could hear what was being said but it's just that drone that you hear
A	mm
B	and it when you watch the the films on telly you know the war planes going and everyone's sat in it
C	mm
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and there's actually the some of the graffiti when they were cleaning it and doing it
C	yeah inside
B	they found graffiti inside that they wrote when they went and it's just like wow
A	amazing
B	yeah it was amazing
B	it really was
C	my last little trip was in erm a Lynx wasn't it? we did a a Lynx trip that we had to load of cadets
B	yeah
C	we arranged it for them to come
B	right
C	so you ring them up
B	yeah
C	and say hi I've got a load of cadets want to go flying in your helicopter
B	mm
C	are you available on the fourteenth of August? and they go
B	mm
C	and I say well if we go to this airbase they'll have fuel okay right
B	yeah
C	we'll sort that out fill in this form it's one a well easy form to fill in
B	yeah
C	send it back and we'll book it and you're like it can't be that easy
A	book it in French
C	but you know with the air force
B	yeah
C	it just doesn't happen you just
B	mm
C	I don't understand why the air force can't do the same thing but the army appear to have he said what he did say was
B	mm mm
C	obviously if something else comes up that's more important then you get binned
B	yeah
C	I said well that's a given you know
B	yeah that's right yeah need to go and invade China or something
C	and erm
A	yeah
C	we did erm
B	mm
C	and er I'd rung this guy up and he said yeah we can do the the Tuesday I think he said we could do so so we hadn't told we said we won't tell the cadets
B	no
C	what we're doing because we don't want them to get them to get all excited and then it gets binned
B	yeah something happens
C	cos you know weather's bad
B	yeah
C	aircraft goes US aircraft gets retasked happens all the time erm you know that's it it's you know you don't want to get them all worked up so we told them all
B	no
C	cos you have to print a programme of what we're doing for the week a sort of activity plan so we printed
B	mm mm
C	they were all like what's that?
B	yeah
C	a big cat adventure
B	yes yes safari
C	so they were all a lot of them were convinced it was
B	mm mm
C	so anyway on the Tuesday morning he rings me and says we've been retasked
B	ah no
C	he says I'm he says I'm ever so sorry but we some general is going somewhere and we're the backup aircraft
B	mm yeah
C	if the general's if his helicopter and the bloody general came to our place another Lynx helicopter landed on the
B	ah
C	it was really annoying erm
B	mm
C	I said
B	yeah
C	he said we'll fly them up until when it gets dark
B	yeah
C	and I'm like are you sure?
B	yeah
C	cos I'm thinking you would let the air force fly at four o'clock it's sleep time
B	yeah yeah
A	it's time to go home don't you know
C	time to go home
A	show me the mess
C	so we're gonna so these guys were gonna fly from
B	yeah
C	which is down in
A	mm
C	and we were like that's I was pretty impressed with that
B	yeah
C	so I said okay then so we yeah alright if you can do that he
B	yeah
C	yeah not a problem we'll do it we'll come tomorrow
B	yeah make sure you're not retasked or
C	so erm
B	yeah
C	the big cat adventure was
B	okay
C	and then so we said so the big cat adventure was actually the Lynx helicopter but he's coming tomorrow so so so fingers crossed he's coming tomorrow
B	yeah
C	so sure enough we got a phone call erm interestingly enough one of the guys whose mate was erm one of the guys on the camp his mate was er he's involved in something to do with the radar
B	oh right
C	er a UK radar
B	mm
C	so he can see what's going on all over the UK and he rang in rung in and said do us a favour and that it's can you see any Lynxes coming this way?
B	yeah
C	and he said yeah there is a Lynx coming in your
B	yeah
C	it's heading towards you I think that's the that's yours
B	yeah
C	so we knew he was coming before he actually rang us
B	yeah oh that's good yeah
C	and then we and then we got in and did and he
B	mm
C	and there was about forty cadets
B	wow
C	he flew all of them
B	yeah
C	and then he even flew the glider squadrons based at
B	yeah
C	and he took them for a flight as well but the thing is they're all like adults
B	yeah
C	so they had one seat left and I'd already been up once with the cadets cos all
B	yeah
C	and there was one space left on the on the flight the last flight of all these glider pilots on
B	mm
C	and they said oh do you wanna you know do you wanna have another go? so I said yeah
B	yeah
C	and he proper threw it around
B	yeah
C	because they were
B	yeah
C	and they were all like pilots so he was like really wanging it around in the air and that's and then he said do you wanna we'll do a photograph
A	oh excellent
C	he said we can either do a static on the ground or if you want we'll come and hover behind you so
B	oh
C	it's not I mean it was getting dark so the light wasn't great but
B	yeah oh even so yeah
C	it was brilliant that and that is
B	yeah
C	that is so weird standing there and you got this huge the noise of the helicopter
B	mm yeah the
C	right behind you
B	yeah
C	the wind and everything and you
C	yeah pretty special
B	been on that a few times haven't you? cos they came to
C	well that's the that the last that was the one at
B	yeah
C	I I've spoke to him again cos er
A	yeah just before you finished wasn't it I thought
C	it was the last one of the last things I did
B	mm
C	went up and had a flight in the helicopter
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it wasn't as exciting as the previous one at
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	a lot of them have probably been on a lot more rides
C	no that was interesting cos we went to
C	they need they need a they need to have a flight in an aircraft
B	yeah yeah
C	it's part of their signing-off process I don't know
B	yeah
C	and we're like would you mind if they went on your helicopter that you've got? this is the air force asking us would you mind if we borrowed your helicopter?
B	yeah
C	I'm like
B	get their go yeah yeah
C	cos that's what we've arranged it
B	yeah exactly
C	yeah yeah that'll be right I'm thinking and I want a go as well so
