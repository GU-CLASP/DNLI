A	right so that's recording again got a bit muddled up there
C	no so I don't see a lot of
A	yeah
C	erm she's a busy girl isn't she?
A	I'm I'm I would be surprised if she was organised with things
D	she must have her she had or having? she must have her interview coming up soon
A	yeah March some time I can't remember or erm
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	she jump up here again
A	yeah she loves you
C	come here no she's after my jumper
A	you think she can smell your dogs?
C	erm no I don't think so cos the dogs don't come on the sofa at my house anymore do they? she might be able to smell the guineas
A	mm
C	cos I've probably picked a guinea pig up
A	mm mm I dunno where
C	probably gone to find a nice pile of towels somewhere
A	ah honestly there's a load of towels and tea towels
D	are you as specific with your towels at home as you are at work?
C	I bet she is
A	my towels are you should see the top shelf is all sheets and they're all chucked up higgledy piggledy and the bottom of the the shelf down in the bathroom is towels and they're perfect and ah
A	I do have a towel obsession I don't know why
A	I barely did yeah I hardly had any time to do washing yesterday
D	it's a bit serious when you've not kept up with your washing
A	we did have it fairly we we did well for them we only had two to put to bed last night and there was some washing but not loads and anyway with
C	yeah that's if
D	I know we could tell
C	she's a bit obsessed with washing
D	we could tell that they'd had a bit of an obsessive war the other week cos there was washing all over the place and it was all in the wrong place and I was just
C	oh god
C	I think it's my deodorant
A	on Saturday she just
C	he's going for my armpit sorry to interrupt but
A	she's weird with you she's not weird like that with anybody else on Saturday she and she said yes
A	he went no this Saturday just gone
D	I just can't just the two going at the thought of going in after the two of them it's just like oh my god
A	I thought that once
D	mm
C	why's she putting her nose in my armpit?
A	mm weird weird cat
C	must be my deodorant
A	here she comes she'll have to go in the garden or she might be behind
C	yeah
A	that big puddle on the front there she had her front wheels in it cos she was turning round she slammed it in to reverse and rammed on the accelerator and it just went and covered the whole car couldn't see out of any of the windows
C	oh no
A	it was like we'd been on a rally rally track
C	oh god
C	oh dear
A	and it was still like it when she picked me up last night
D	it's alright I'm used to it the whole the whole
A	well yeah our our drive is
C	you need like a dingy to get to your house at times innit?
D	it hasn't gone down the last few days actually
A	what you need is everybody
C	it's hardcore
D	hardcore
A	fill that hole
D	yeah but you can't fill the hole cos there's a drain it's just going to go down the drain it's not the water's not going to go
C	there's a big drain in the middle of it?
D	there's a drain yeah there's two drains either end
E	hello
A	hello
D	hello
E	hi hello
D	hello
E	did you make me one?
A	no
E	ah you knew I was home soon
A	did you erm did you get your ticket?
E	yeah
A	that's good
E	it was weird because it said when I was filling in the application form she said oh we don't pay for higher speed I thought oh okay fair enough it just makes it a bit longer
A	yeah just pay four quid for an upgrade
E	well I thought oh okay whatever and then erm I went I had to hand in the form and then I had to wait for an hour and
A	yeah
E	then I had to go to this warrant she wrote in my warrant non high speed erm so I thought ah okay fair enough so I just anyway went to the station to exchange it for a ticket and he just gave me a high speed ticket any route permitted and told me to get on the high speed train
A	ah he must have liked the look of you
C	yeah
E	I don't think he realised I don't think they even think about giving you a high speed tickets now I don't think they even it's the only one that passes there he just typed in probably
A	yeah well that's good then anyway
C	that was handy
E	I didn't just didn't say anything
A	cos you could have paid a little bit extra I think it's four quid each way for an upgrade
E	yeah it's four quid but I just thought I'll see what happens I won't make a fuss and I'll see what happens and I thought that might happen so
A	oh excellent
E	good
A	so have you got all your time your times do you have to book seats or anything on the?
E	no I've just got a standard ticket open return
A	because if it's one of those one from King's Cross up to the north east you have to book a seat certainly you
E	well he didn't book me a seat so
A	oh okay
E	he said it's an open ticket so yeah that's all
A	oh that would've been a bummer if you'd had to go to Charing Cross cos
E	I know I was thinking that and then and then she looked up timetables for me she said oh you get on the eight forty-three and I thought well that's a high speed train but I just thought okay didn't say anything
A	mm mm
E	erm yeah it just says ten o'clock leave London King's Cross and get on the Aberdeen service to
A	mm
E	it just says
A	do you know where you're going when you get off?
E	no it just says get the train to
A	yeah well
E	oh
A	yeah
E	and then I get on erm another one to
A	yeah but when you get off at
E	oh I have to get a taxi they're putting twenty pounds in my account for a taxi
A	oh I say
C	oh that's nice
A	I'm gonna go on Jobseekers
D	well I had one in
A	yeah
D	and one here
C	OL
E	well I wish they'd given it to me in cash because erm it's annoying
A	oh
E	I have to get the cash out oh yeah here's your money by the way mum
A	what money?
E	for your clothes
A	no you can keep that
E	oh thanks mum
C	oh yeah
D	yeah yeah yeah
C	we took some up there right and we got about fifteen quid
A	yeah we got
E	everyone was everyone was taking loads
C	I would
A	next time
A	we'll take the rest of it
E	yeah take the rest of it and
A	all together yeah
E	and then give the money to me
A	cos there's still I've still got two or three bags up there haven't I?
E	yeah there's loads up there
A	yeah
E	I don't know if it would be twenty quid's worth though it's only forty P a kilo
A	yeah
E	that was like six kilos that bag
A	well when I went before it was erm fifty P a kilo it's only forty now
E	but even so you only miss out on
C	did they check your bags cos they checked some of our stash anything with holes they didn't want
A	yeah well yeah because I thought they used it as scrap material and it was all going to be cut up so I put any old
C	yeah I did yeah
E	no they sell it on I think cos they put a sign there saying the price has gone down cos the second hand clothes market's dropped or something
A	yeah so they must sell it on
E	they must sell it
C	oh right
A	so they've got to be fit for purpose
C	they're picky
E	still it's better than giving it away bit more
A	mm
C	yeah it's nice isn't it?
E	yeah it's quite popular there were three people waiting when I went
A	well we ought to sort out all our books and give them to that
E	well I've just given a load to Save the Children I just had a declutter of my room I don't have any books left
A	oh I've got loads I've got loads to
E	yeah
A	no I was just talking to this bloke who goes there on a Tuesday and he's a bit he's a bit shy there's there's one bloke one we all started last Tuesday it was all our first day
E	oh right yeah
A	well mine was the second day but we and one of them is called
E	oh no
A	who's there and then there was another called
E	not
A	who's a bit of a bit of a geek and he's really sweet but very shy and very inward you know and he stands washing up and tries not
E	ah a bit of a geek
A	anyway I was drying up today and he was washing and I was talking to him and I said what do you do?
E	he probably was thinking of please stop talking to me
A	I said what do you I felt sorry I feel sorry for him I said what do you? cos he's a bit overshadowed by the
E	yeah
A	and I said er what do you do for the rest of the week and he said oh I volunteer in the bookshop up the road I thought oh I wanted to say
E	does he not earn money?
A	well I don't know
E	does he just read books or something
A	I didn't like to delve any further
C	probably got a rich mum mum and dad
A	I'm not
E	yeah I wish I could do things like that I can't either
A	mm so he works at the bookshop all week and that one Tuesday
E	yeah that's a good idea hadn't thought about the bookshop
A	yeah
E	is it have you seen the bookshop? you should you it's really funny it's a really it's a crooked building
A	I know he said they've only been there a year
E	it's good it looks good
A	mm
C	need another log on the fire
A	I think I do have to be careful not to put the moneybox log on spot the moneybox log
C	what?
A	I didn't tell you about this?
D	no
A	we've got this we've got our holiday fund
D	oh right
D	yeah
A	that you have to open with a tin opener and every now and again we chuck chuck a note in or whatever and er cos eh cos we're hopeless and saving so but anyway
C	hid it in a log
A	let me show you this is what he's
C	well just throw it on
A	he's made it into a log
C	ah that's really clever
A	cut the end of the log off and put a magnet on it
D	that's really clever
C	that's a good idea though isn't it?
A	well it looks like that but when it's all surrounded by logs you'd never know
C	yeah no look at that
C	yeah you just had that you just recorded all that now
A	oh yeah I just told everybody that we've got a log
C	yeah
E	oh no
A	better delete that
E	oh no
A	tried to do it in two sittings
C	we had to have a break
A	while we had a break and had a coffee
E	yeah
A	we had to suspend recording for a while
E	that's okay I did erm I did an hour with
A	oh did you? how is she? why hasn't she been to see me had she while she's been here?
E	because she's a bitch I don't know we went on a country walk through the footpaths opposite her house and we she had a pair of suede light brown suede shoes and I had these on so it was really inappropriate
A	oh my god
E	we've ruined our shoes probably but you know
A	by the way those towel and tea towels you put here
E	oh were they not folded correctly?
A	no they weren't but why I was refolding them
E	were they not clean?
A	they were a bit wet
C	not any more
A	no
C	they were there's one these
E	oh no
A	and now the settee I can't get the smell off the settee
E	ah well I didn't know
A	and they've come right through no it wasn't your fault I'm just telling you they're back in the back in the washing machine now
E	oh what a waste
A	I suspect my trousers probably now smell of them cos I'm been sitting on this settee I can't get rid of the smell of it
C	you think you can smell it
E	oh it will disappear eventually
A	no I can
C	I'm pretty sure it's probably not
A	I can I keep getting wafts of it when I sit down
E	did you see me mum? as I waved at you today?
A	yeah yeah didn't you see me wave?
E	no you didn't look like you recognised me
A	I didn't until you were just going past just before you tooted I waved
E	that was good timing wasn't it?
A	mm it was
E	not every single word I just have to
C	well thank goodness
A	oh that's good
E	oh but like
C	I forgot myself at one stage
D	yeah but it's probably not interesting to anyone else they'll be like oh
C	we were on about as you get older you get get a bit of you know down here if grey you know I'm not mentioning again cos I
A	no I'll tell you later
E	it's alright I I have to have a little listen you know I might catch that little bit
C	yeah I'm sure you will
C	oh well
E	we had lunch at the
A	oh did you?
E	just before I left
A	how is she since she came out of hospital?
E	she seems okay she's doing
A	oh
E	she's going home tonight
A	so she's been home for a long weekend and she hasn't been to see me once
E	you should say something
A	I will
C	oh oh my cat wants to come in
A	he he oh have I locked the cat flap?
C	yeah
A	well she's quite clever she actually finds a way of hooking it outwards and climbing through if you leave her long enough
E	I cleaned I cleaned around the cat bowl today
A	oh no they're
E	cos cos you know when they just get it all on the floor and eat it it was all like dried old cat food all round that bowl it was disgusting
A	yeah no she she eventually she'll she'll learn to hook it outwards and she'll hook it backwards and climb through that way the other two are bit thick they won't do that but I have to lock it when the wind gets up cos it just blows open
C	yeah
E	you know what I kept thinking that yesterday that it was open I didn't think to lock it the whole day I was looking at it
C	hello
A	ah is she cold?
C	she is a bit she's warming up aren't you mate?
A	come here she's my baby
C	can't stay mad at you for long
A	no I I can't she's my she's my darling
A	yeah I knew that
E	I didn't know that
A	yeah
C	ah
A	and she was beautiful and
C	mm
A	and he's ginger and she was black and she was gorgeous and she just disappeared on Boxing Day didn't she? when she was about eighteen months old
E	yeah
A	never to be seen again
E	yeah
C	yeah I had a cat disappear like that
D	was she fed somewhere else and
A	I don't know no I don't know I think either a fox got her or she was cos next door that was when they used to talk to us they had a black and white fluffy cat
D	long hair
A	long haired and this ours was long haired and theirs went missing at about the same time so I wonder if they were
D	stolen
A	cat cat nabbed
C	you know there's a dog there's a van going round stealing people's dogs round in
D	I saw that did you share that on Facebook or something?
C	I did
E	yeah I saw that
C	yeah yeah don't leave your dogs outside shops they're warning people cos they're getting snatched from outside
A	but what do you do with a long haired cat? cos she wasn't she was only a moggy cat she wasn't anything you know she wasn't Burmese or anything like that so and neither was was theirs but anyway but
E	yeah I'm going to go to
A	he's erm you know you're sitting there stroking him like this and then he'll suddenly bite you for no reason
C	oh really?
A	yeah he's nasty
C	he's got a bit of a psycho streak you get some dogs like that though one one dog in a litter
A	yeah
C	my my cousin's dog female lab
A	really a Labrador?
C	cos you you look at her funny mate she'll go she's go for you she
A	that's quite unusual with labs isn't it?
C	yeah oh well
A	well as my friend my friend
E	mm
A	I was glad when that one snuffed it hello
C	she's got such a cute little face
A	I know she's my baby
C	not as nice as her
A	no she's not as beautiful as my little cat
A	but she was from a different litter
C	the other one had a fixation on my armpit that one
A	yeah
C	and then she started licking my hair
D	you say it so proudly
C	he started pulling my hair didn't he?
A	yeah
C	licking it a pulling trying to
A	she went a bit she goes a bit funny when she's round
C	that's
C	I don't know perhaps it was my roll on
A	could be
E	I didn't realise today when I was in job centre I forgot to put deodorant on this morning
A	did you smell?
E	well it's quite a big jumper so I think it contains the smell but
E	I was all sweaty and then I thought oh I forgot to put deodorant on
C	she was acting really strange first of all it was jumper she liked cos I think she knows it's a cat on it
A	yeah yeah could be
C	and then she started trying to get her nose up under here and
A	it can't be catnip cos the other two aren't interested
C	no it's probably the deodorant
A	ah it's next door
C	is it?
E	I thought Easter holidays were over?
A	they are its ten to five
E	yeah
A	quarter to five
C	god you've got to put prescriptions in
D	I don't have to put it in today
C	you don't they have a thing outside where you can just put them in a
A	you got to put round the chemist or in the
D	no it's not repeat it's just one off dentist script
A	oh it's a script you've got to take it to chemist?
E	yeah
A	oh right right
C	they don't shut till half past weekdays
E	I don't have to do it today I've had it for about three weeks already so
C	is it half five on a weekday?
D	no it's at six it's six o'clock
C	oh plenty of time then
A	no cos at our doctors if you want to put a repeat script in request a repeat script they've just got a little box outside you can put it in there
D	inside the surgery isn't it?
C	yeah inside our one
D	and there's not one round at the doctors
A	well that's a bit stupid if it's out out out of opening hours isn't it?
C	yeah no it is bloody doctors useless they are
A	I think they're in the front garden
E	there is it that baby's head is freezing
C	that's really odd it sounds like they're all on helium doesn't it?
C	where's it coming from? sounds like
D	they're in the living room
A	they're not usually that noisy I can't usually I can hear them upstairs I can hear them when they're upstairs cos the walls are thin but I don't actually hear them downstairs no it'll be that bit
D	yeah
A	their house their house only comes to here
C	oh right yeah
A	I don't hear them down here usually they must be in the hallway
E	yeah
A	their stairs run up there cos they like it when we've got our fire lit cos it it heats their stairwell for nothing they get a nice nice warm walls
C	that's probably why they're all sitting on the stairs
A	yeah
E	yeah they probably hear parties mum
A	oh
D	oh I think there's they definitely heard that
C	wasn't that wasn't that supposed to be a games night but it turned out to be a right piss up?
A	yeah
D	it was a games night
A	and turned into a bit of a bit of a mess
D	cos you all cheated
A	it was a bit messy wasn't it by the end?
D	she was like this trying to
A	and then and she went upstairs to the upstairs toilet was sick in dad's tool box
C	yes I had the pleasure of
A	I didn't I didn't cos I was in

C	you'd been drinking when we arrived
A	I'd had a few drinks but then then they started making me drink no you didn't make me I think I
D	making you drink
A	no I think I willingly took them that night
E	what was that?
A	shots
D	I don't remember shots that night
A	and I don't do shots
D	I remember shots at my house when me and
A	oh that's right yeah see I can't I that's when one I'm alright on wine I get very silly and very
C	I get drunk very quickly on wine
A	give me give me spirits and I'm I am hopeless
C	I'm the other way spirits I can drink you know all night and I'll I'll you know I can pace myself with that wine couple of glasses I'm anybody's terrible
A	yeah I'm the opposite
D	I'm okay as long as we never ever do a repeat of
A	oh my god
C	I wasn't there that night
A	coming home from there no cos we were doing shots that night
A	coming home from there
D	it weren't just a few shots either it was like you got a number you did a shot
C	I know oh god
A	I was being sick out of the car door
D	I don't remember that
D	I got a lift home with you didn't I?
A	yes
A	oh no maybe it wasn't
D	oh I wasn't there then
A	and we were giving
E	er
C	I done it outside my mate's car years ago
D	hello
C	she was still driving at the time
D	was it
C	the next morning
D	or out of it
C	the next morning she'd gone out it'd all dried down the side of her car
A	oh it's horrible yeah
C	oh god
A	puked in it
E	yeah
A	yeah it was that long ago dad
D	and
A	and
D	cos
A	that's right yeah and we were dropping
D	it was all
A	the row of houses just before
E	okay
A	so it was from
D	I don't remember being paralytic
A	you were because I couldn't talk any sense because she gave me a twenty pound note she got out the car and said that's for petrol
D	because it was all I had
A	I said I don't want petrol
D	and yet how was I drunk? cos then you gave it to
A	because I didn't realize
D	no
A	and it turned out the
D	she was convinced somehow that she'd showed her shoes cos she couldn't find her shoes
A	so erm I had to tell her so you owe
C	oh
D	she was clearly more drunk than I was
A	she didn't remember it yeah
D	cos I remember giving you the money cos it was all I had
A	yeah so you would not twenty quid from there to there
C	I don't know that was a good night was that
A	it was a good night
D	that was a good night
C	naked waiters
D	it was the night of
A	I went to
C	oh yeah I forgot all about that
A	that naked waiter was there again only the one
C	oh god only the one was it the
A	no it wasn't we said to him where's your mate? and he said oh you well I did ask him to come and he wouldn't come he said he couldn't
C	oh
A	it's wise I think he was a bit scared of you all
C	not surprised we kept slapping his bottom
A	he said to
C	was it a good night out there?
A	well it was sort of just people milling about she she's done it beautifully
C	has she?
A	well I should I suspect
A	she's got you know everything she's got I was thinking
C	mm
A	is having in the process they've had to put it on hold at the moment cos they've run out of money but out of the process of this thing being built and she wants two cut hair chairs for cutting
D	yeah
A	you know she's got the sink and the recliner thing but she wants to just and erm I cos they're about two hundred quid each and they're the ones I'm looking at which are nothing like the ones that
D	yeah
A	absolutely everything laid out I know
C	and the other half does
A	I know tanning booth massage table everything
E	but at least when
C	that's it
E	she didn't get it given to her
C	it is
A	well she'll have one given to her
D	it is it is the first thing
A	for Christmas
A	yeah mm mm
D	well I I I'm I'm kinda I think
E	never get paid back
A	yeah mm mm
E	the baby is kind of oozing and then the bottom's getting bigger and bigger
A	oh yeah it's gone a bit lopsided
E	yeah it's kind of falling out the ear
A	he's looking a bit eerie
C	is he coming has he got wax coming out of his ear?
A	yes
D	it's earwax
A	erm
C	oh
A	he's he's gorgeous he's such a beautiful baby

A	yeah she's got the hair salon and everything
D	is she doing it or has she got somebody in doing it?
A	no she's doing it
D	what like cuts or just?
A	yeah I think so
D	really?
A	I think so cos she cuts
C	did she have training then?
A	well I don't know not as far I mean
D	I don't think I've never mentioned
A	she's done a day course I think
D	yeah
A	which is a bit of a shame cos she and
C	I was going to say weren't they going to sort of like
A	well it was all very loose yeah but if
D	I didn't know that
A	yeah she's got a fully equipped hair salon room and she's got all her own shampoos and things
C	really?
A	so I don't know how you get around that with erm trade prescriptions and all that business?
C	yeah
A	but it is it is lovely I was quite impressed
D	whenever I see gonna see her I always think ah I really should have plucked my eyebrows before I go and see her cos she looks at them
A	oh yes I've made an appointment with her haven't I? next Tuesday
D	yes
A	next Tuesday four o'clock
C	well you should get her to do them while you're up there
A	she's doing my eyebrows and eye tinting my eyelashes next Tuesday I've made an appointment
C	how much is it?
A	I can't remember she's quite cheap
D	yeah it's reasonable yeah
A	her prices are really reasonable
C	I reckon we should get spray tans before we go down to Butlins you know
D	I'd rather not look like a umpa lumpa
A	yeah no they're a bit I don't like spray tans
