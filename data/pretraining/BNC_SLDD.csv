B	yeah
A	so we just kind of end up walking everywhere which was fine for me and
A	so erm
B	mm
A	erm and then went to in the evening went to this erm massive light erm fountain exhibition like they have the beautiful it's it's not a stately home it's now the national museum but it looks like it used to be palace or a stately home and it's like up erm up a hill with like fountains and like beautiful steps and at the bottom there's this massive fountain and they had this music and water display and that was again miles away so you had to walk all the way there and you know when like you're in a city with people who like none of you know where you're going but you're the one who's kind of vaguely suggested doing this and you end up being in charge? so I was like okay let's walk this way and then when you kind of get the wrong way they're like
A	erm
A	like I didn't think it was a bad beach although oh my god I've never seen so much nakedness in my life

A	and the weather was so nice it was twenty-nine degrees and
B	nice
A	it was just remembering to drink constantly is really hard

B	partially I need to buy some like not clothes but toiletries and stuff
A	yeah
B	no luckily at least mum's got us some like mosquito repellent and stuff like that
A	oh that's good
B	I I need to buy that cos I really don't wanna get bitten
A	no no I know what you mean it's a pain in the arse getting bitten we got I didn't actually get too badly eaten this weekend
B	that's good
A	I got the odd bite but nothing major which was really good
B	that is good
B	oh
A	did she?
B	yeah unfortunate like right in the middle of her forehead
A	yeah
B	that sucks
A	mm
A	oh really? how come? oh
A	like an Indian wedding wasn't it like
B	yes
B	it's a bite that is a shit place to have a bite though
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	so are you having a girly bonding with your mum on Saturday then?
B	yeah
A	a nice little pedicure
B	have to I'm going to bake on Friday night
A	oh are you?
B	yeah
A	what to get ready for Saturday
B	afternoon tea
A	oh are you doing afternoon tea here or at home?
B	here
A	what so you're going to
B	yeah because the whole point was that we were going to
A	oh I see okay
B	but to be fair it would make sense though like cos I guess I can bring my mum and then she can stay in the flat with
A	yeah yeah cos you've gotta come back here anyway haven't you?
B	exactly I'll be here tomorrow and Saturday night so
A	mm hot cross buns then
B	teacake
A	teacake
B	I'm really hungry
A	I'm so hungry like I've eaten the thing is like when you're on holiday you always end up eating lots of like shit you know like just not bad food but just like lots of like carbs like lots of bread and so I was like today I just wanted a salad at lunchtime but then the problem with having a salad that you end up feeling really hungry
B	exactly that's what I had and I was absolutely starving well I ate my apple and wasn't really very satisfied with that either
B	and I had a teacake it's a vicious circle
A	it's a vicious circle yeah I think I want to
B	and you're just frigging starving
A	you end up eating more because you're hungry
B	and it fruit doesn't fill me up either so
A	I know
B	if I have an apple I'm just like well great
A	it's not the same satisfying like feeling as a erm
B	toasted teacake
A	yeah
A	as a as a big carbohydrate loaded cake
B	mm that looks really good
A	it should be alright I hope
B	mm
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	payday that's good I love payday so payday makes my life
B	it makes my life too although
A	but then I kind of feel bad that I'm living for the payday
B	yeah
A	kind of like mm this is what my life has become
B	I will transfer you
A	yeah all the bills come out on the first
B	and I'll be back
A	by the time what sorry?
B	the rent comes out I'll be back
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	so that's all isn't it? that's all I transfer you isn't it? bills and the rent
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I always love how I emailed
B	oh yeah she's
B	I think I think you should ring her
A	no cos she hates me
B	so?
A	well ringing her is just gonna make her hate me even more
B	does it matter in the in the grand scheme of things whether your estate agent hates you?
A	nah
B	I mean she's a douchebag anyway
A	true but they're all in the control of our deposits and shit aren't they? oh no no okay they're not
B	not I don't think it's
A	that's what I was thinking and I tried to actually have a look if I could make a formal complaint erm I couldn't find a way of doing it
B	it's a shit estate agency anyway
A	yeah but she's just er exceptionally poor she makes
B	I just can't work out still to this day why why not replying helps her problem
A	exactly
B	ouch
A	doesn't are you alright?
B	yeah
A	yeah it just doesn't make her look any better and it doesn't solve the problem
B	no makes her look like an even bigger twat if anything
A	yeah
B	like
A	like I don't understand why she can't just take the fifteen pounds off the rent
B	why don't you just next time just
A	just suggest that
B	or just don't pay fifteen pounds? I I I don't even think they freaking check anyway
A	no true
B	when was the last time we actually like
A	that's true actually I've never had a confirmation that we've paid
B	exactly so for all we know we could never have paid anyway
A	it's true maybe maybe that's the case
B	it is weird
A	and it's just like in my job like sometimes yeah it just takes me a while to get back to people but I always get back and when I do I'm like I'm so sorry you know
B	yeah
A	I'm like busy with something else or
B	doesn't take you weeks and weeks to reply
A	no not at all
B	she's just a douchebag
A	so many douches in the world
B	exactly and we have one of them as our estate agent
A	exactly exactly
B	unfortunately
A	damn them
B	oh
A	I'm excited you know when you're like sitting there and you're like I actually miss her
B	ah
A	I just wanna see her
B	bless her
A	I will
B	can I grab some butter to go on my
A	yeah go ahead
B	midway through
A	buttering
B	buttering which is sad
A	disaster
B	ah
A	she's seriously the weird she has the weirdest taste in cards
B	I found it a little bit strange but it's fine it's the thought that counts
A	no but that's like a standard nan card from her
B	oh okay
A	it's like it kind of looks like they're for children doesn't it?
B	a little bit
A	they're like girly children like teddy bears and the pink and stuff and
B	perhaps where she goes she can't find a granddaughter card that's old maybe
A	yeah maybe
B	maybe she doesn't
A	it's just they're funny they're always funny and they've always been like that it you genuinely now like me and
A	which card from nan is better?
A	they're just brilliant they're just so
B	exactly bless her
A	she is I do love granny
B	yeah it's really good
A	mental problems
B	that's good
A	how's your grandma by the way?
B	fine
A	how's she doing? is she good?
B	all good
A	can't believe how long has she been in recovery now for? like two or no
B	only just because she
A	in recovery
B	recently
A	oh okay that's good though
B	there's no rationale anyway
A	yeah
B	all good
A	yay
B	it's good bless her bless everyone
A	bless the world
A	mm
B	oh

A	oh really? what was she doing?
B	being bossy
A	like fuck off then
B	fuck off
A	yeah
B	what to do?
A	mm
B	it's really annoying
A	like tell you what to do and you're just like why do you have any right? and then because they tell you to do something you automatically want to do the opposite
B	yeah
A	I got a erm
B	she smokes as well which surprises me
A	really?
B	yeah
A	that really surprises me
B	like
A	wow
B	yeah
A	I would never put
B	I always put her she I mean she smokes rollies I suppose you're you know cool
A	yeah yeah well
B	still weird so everyone that that I was working with er smokes so they all kept like going away to have fags I was like for fuck's sake
A	that really annoys me like at work when people leave to have a cigarettes breaks it's like no cos if I went out for ten minutes every time like if I had as many breaks as you did I would not get
B	you wouldn't get away with it
A	no
B	sounds stupid to me
A	but talking about people telling you to do stuff and erm not being very happy with it I had erm a birthday text message from
B	mm fuck off
A	I was like please don't reply what the fuck? what what?
A	I mean

A	yeah
B	I hope you didn't reply
A	no of course I didn't no
B	good

B	that to me says don't reply so I know that you're so angry that you reply
A	yeah he kind of was like don't reply so I'm making your birthday about me because I don't want you to reply
B	yeah
A	because my girlfriend might find out that that you sent me a text message
B	remember me
A	remember yeah don't reply though because it'll make it like awkward
B	oh
A	yeah
B	he's such a dick
A	I was just I know I was just like as if you just made my birthday text message
B	about
A	about you
B	that just really says it all doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	easy
A	yeah
B	that that that solves that problem
A	text messaging because I care
B	no you don't
A	care about yourself
A	it's like well what a knob
B	it's
A	well the first part was fine and then it just went downhill from there
B	an actual knob
A	I know just don't reply you know well okay then I won't reply
B	well don't like he's a dickhead
A	I know just a stupid message from a stupid dick
B	mm
A	yeah I was like I need some vitamins and minerals and salad in my life
B	no
A	nearly no
B	partially
A	I already asked that didn't I?
B	partially
A	yeah
B	no but I will
A	you will you'll get there
B	I'll get there in the end
B	I'm I'm pretty much done to be fair
A	yeah
B	did you?
A	damn it
B	well I've just got
A	oh yeah?
B	so that's annoying me cos my address my home address is
A	mm
B	attached to the account and it's gone there
A	mm
B	which is annoying but I'll try it
A	oh yeah did they not have a bigger size or a different size?
B	no
A	mm
B	so it's fine
A	just a better top or better bottoms as well?
B	I like their bottoms so I'm keeping them
A	mm
B	but the top I think I found an er let me see if it's still available actually that would be really
A	I do love Asos Asos like
B	mm
B	yeah it's still
A	is it still there?
B	erm
A	mm
B	mm
A	I love how easy it is to order offline off your phone? it's so dangerous
B	very dangerous of there it is oh is it that?
A	that's a good shape
B	mm flattering
A	I always prefer like chunkier straps I think they
B	mm
A	I think they are more flattering than those
B	yes
A	skinny ones
B	yeah
A	how much is it?
B	sixteen pounds it's a fuller bust one
A	fuller bust
B	fuller bust
A	fuller bust
B	you know if I could get thirty-two E? that but it doesn't work like that does it?
A	I think it depends doesn't it? like is it too small where is it like too small? you know it was definitely a bit or you were like definitely a bit too small in the cup wasn't it?
B	the cup was too small
A	mm
B	there's no I would roughly get a thirty-four E
A	yeah
B	but
A	do they not have that?
B	they don't have it
A	what sizes do they have?
B	thirty-four F I think that's too big
A	well at least you can always tighten the straps
B	yeah
A	if it is slightly too bit you can just tighten the straps and it'll
B	yeah I suppose
A	be fine
B	I suppose that's adjustable isn't it?
A	mm
B	doesn't matter so much
A	I guess it's better to go slightly too big
B	mm
A	and be able to tighten it than to go too small and
B	not
A	not be able to to loosen it
A	erm when we go to Paris
B	woo hoo
A	and she has to she has to pay fourteen euros
A	I was like gutted
B	gutted
B	hey that's a I didn't know it was like that
A	mm
B	can't remember what it was though
A	I think a lot of the museums are like that
B	mm
A	mm
B	embrace their culture
A	oh my god erm in Barcelona me and
B	well what did he mean?
A	you have no idea what I'm talking about do you? he goes he was like I do it's about that guy Stanley I was like yes he was like I saw it on The Simpsons once
B	what did he mean?
A	it was the same scene but it was
B	oh okay
A	it was like a Simpsons version of Streetcar Named Desire
B	I see
A	so he was like I was like yeah like you know and there's Blanche he's like who's Blanche? I was like the main person in A Streetcar Named Desire along with Marlon Brando who plays Stanley he was like oh okay
A	but erm
B	perhaps not so much
A	maybe they don't study that
B	they just study Neighbours
A	mm
B	it's on now isn't it?
A	mm I've not caught up with Neighbours since
B	I watched it last week
A	mm
B	and
A	oh yeah and
B	the kid
A	oh the kid
B	he keeps hanging out with the kid cos the kid likes him
A	yeah
B	so he was like don't hang out with her cos you'll make
A	yeah but they can't have Kyle have another affair cos he already had an affair on Georgia and then he's just got married so he can't like have another one
B	he can't do it again that's just
A	he can't do it again
B	really bad
A	mm
B	very bad form
A	it's a poor storyline
B	Imogen and Daniel
A	oh did they get together in the end?
B	yeah
A	oh grim if someone sung to me I'd die
B	me too and they had sex
A	oh Amber's not gonna be very happy
B	he's er he's weird and I think if if I was Imogen I'd be really not okay with it
A	mm
B	I'd literally just feel like he had just broken up with Amber and then just
A	mm
B	I'd feel pretty
A	yeah cos apparently down the erm
A	he was like you would
B	mm
A	like that
B	mm cos she asked about her about that and he was like
A	mm
B	well back then I was just thinking about fate and how fate put me and Amber together and could
A	grim
B	me and you are really meant to be
A	yeah that's what he said to Amber like over and over again like a month ago I never thought we'd get so involved in a TV soap it's ridiculous
A	no
B	it is real
A	no we ought to ask
A	Toadie celebrated his twentieth anniversary or something this week as well
B	yeah but then I just also saw a picture on Facebook that well literally looked like he got carried away by a bouncy castle that's not even a joke and then there was something like erm all ends badly for Toadie or something
A	Toadie can't die
B	he can't die on his twentieth anniversary week by a bouncy castle
A	death
A	that is the worst death ever
B	taken away by a bouncy castle it's very odd and then Sonya's like ah
B	she's really annoying they need to change her opening credit scene cos it's clearly when she was pregnant and she's just got a ridiculous cushion like on her for no reason and it looks stupid
A	mm you know with the whole storyline with erm what the hell's her name? Lauren lusting after Brad again it's just like
B	oh no
A	I think the
B	oh that's another thing
A	oh god what?
B	Amy is now employed as Paul's PA
A	oh yeah er
B	so she was asked to send some email and you could just see it coming you know they just build it up like you could just see what was gonna happen so they were like okay you need to send this person a letter saying that we don't want their services anymore cos they're crap and this person and send the letter
A	and she mixed it up?
B	yeah basically
A	so she fired the wrong person
B	she fired the wrong person
A	what a twat
B	and then Paul blamed Terese for that
B	well Terese is meant to check the letters but Amy said that she just leave she was fine she could do it on her own
A	well Amy should erm tell the truth then what a bitch
B	what a bitch
A	what a skank
B	exactly but I think Paul's trying to get her away from Kyle
A	again Kyle can't do that they cannot redo that storyline again
B	who did he cheat on with who before?
A	Kate
B	oh yeah
A	I mean Kate died did you ever see her death scene? it was the worst death scene ever she got shot and there was no blood anywhere
B	oh it's family television you can't have blood in family TV
A	wasn't even a speck not even a tiny bit
B	was there not splatter on the grass?
A	not even a splatter Mark was perfectly white her dress which was white and blue was still perfectly white and blue
B	she just died?
A	yeah there was no dribble of blood from her mouth
B	so no blood then
A	it was just
B	looked like an
A	pretty much it was just having
B	oh god really?
A	and then she died
B	that's dramatic
A	well she got shot and then collapsed and then she died and then Mark was just like oh oh oh cos he'd just literally proposed
B	very dramatic scene
A	it was it was one of those overly dramatic scenes and everybody in Edinburgh apparently was there
B	Edinburgh?
A	it was just like
A	it
A	my god what is it?
B	Erinsborough
A	Erinsborough there we go
B	close
A	close I'm tired
B	remember the scene where Toadie got married with Dee and then they
A	oh they drop they drop
B	they drove into a
A	yeah
B	the sea
B	that was really sad
A	yeah Dee died
B	she did poor Toadie
A	Toad has some really bad luck with women
B	so bad who else was he with?
A	didn't he get with Libby for a while?
B	I just thought that but I don't think so
A	no I think they did
B	did they?
A	he was with Steph for ages and then Steph turned into
B	oh yeah
A	a psycho what did Steph do? was it cos she had a baby and miscarriage or something?
B	no she ran Ringo over by accident
A	what him and? no she was married to Max when she did that wasn't she?
B	mm oh yeah
A	cos who was it? it was Summer and Boyd
B	yeah
A	Boyd drove up into the distance didn't he?
B	yeah
A	Summer went to
B	she did come back
A	oh did she?
B	she was a different person though
A	oh I hate it when they do that it's so annoying and she has like it was like when they changed the person who played Declan that was just stupid
B	that was stupid and you just always missed old Declan
A	mm
B	new Declan was shit
A	and Bridget Bridget died as well didn't she?
A	did she die giving birth?
B	yeah
A	and Declan's baby as well wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	they were like sixteen years old or something stupid like that
