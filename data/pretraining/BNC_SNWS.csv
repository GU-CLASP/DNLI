A	yeah I think it's more manageable in terms of file size erm there was one that was a hundred and thirty-two megabytes the other day and it was just too big
B	aha
B	aha
A	and then
B	aha
A	with
B	smallish place
A	yeah a small square in the middle with parking all around a few shops you know? the butcher the baker the candlestick maker all around in a square and that's it
B	mm mm
A	and otherwise it's just sort of a thoroughfare for other places
B	yeah
A	and
B	sounds nice
A	absolutely stunning and then the bit that I'll be staying in will be
B	mm
A	still see woodpeckers saw erm the great spotted saw a male and a female and I saw a green woodpecker and they have jays and they have all sorts of cute little birds as well thirteen cats I think something like six dogs
B	do they have wi-fi?
A	they don't have wi-fi
B	aha
A	so you can go to the main house and get wi-fi and then in theory the log cabin has an Ethernet cable but I took my computer one time and plugged it in and didn't work so
B	oh okay
A	and then erm it's got a little wood burner which is why I'm not living there now
B	right erm
A	yeah it is and then you sort of look out there's like a bit of a clearing and they've got horses and cows and ducks and hens and they sort of are in the clearing bit and then you've got some more trees and then over the top of the trees where the sun rises you get this beautiful view of
B	nice
A	and you've got all the jaggedy mountains that look really sort of red and orange with the sunrise and it's just beautiful
B	very nice
A	mm so I'm looking forward to that oh and they've got thirteen beehives and I really want to learn everything there is to know about bees
B	yeah no no no
A	yeah
B	well I'll come and get it myself
A	yeah
B	no I'm looking forward to a relaxing couple of days wherever we are going anyway
A	what? now?
B	in
A	yeah I'm really looking forward to the spa I love feeling the heat in my bones
A	you know?
B	yeah and it you need it at this time of year
A	yeah and I love a wet heat that you get from the steam rooms
B	yeah I've been considering I've not been doing it I don't think it's fair to but having like evening showers as well
A	yeah
B	just because I mean to get you know warmth in my bones my feet especially
A	mm
B	ah well I've had the heating on
A	yeah
B	ah on and off depending on where I am and what I'm doing but
A	ah okay
B	it's it's not on a timer
A	ah
B	but it's a little bit it's either too sensitive or not sensitive at all in that it's either on really hot
A	oh okay
B	or it's not on at all
B	yeah and like even if you put it on two it stays cold and if you put it on three or four then it's really hot it's
B	yeah ah it's been a real problem
A	I've found that I can be toasty in the living room because it's you know it's a big enough room and it's got two radiators in it and then I go up to bed it's fucking freezing
B	mm mm
A	cos it's you know a big-sized room with just four windows no curtains
B	yeah
A	and yeah I
B	yeah
A	good
B	mm mm
A	erm and then stuff on the top so I don't mind
B	no I don't mind doing that
A	and then I gather then there are just three single beds for three single people but I didn't really like the idea of four people spreading out on three beds pushed together
B	no
A	little bit close not that I don't like you all cos of course I do but you know?
B	no I'm the same I just can't sleep with other people around
A	nah me either
B	I don't think I'll sleep very well anyway so it doesn't matter if I'm on the floor
A	it's great isn't it?
B	to go yeah we've done so much but it's been erm like as I said before as I've said before I've really enjoyed doing daytime things and having nights to yourself
A	yeah
A	cos when the you've got sunlight you know technically you're active and then oh lots of flashing lights
B	yeah oh my goodness me
A	oh
B	I think what is that?
A	oh my god cop cars one two three four five six
B	oh my god
A	that's a raid that is seven oh my god that's that's a raid that's not an accident
B	yes
A	wow
B	detectivey-type cars
A	yeah undercover cars seem to have a lot of those undercover cars in Poland
B	do you think?
B	yeah well when
A	yeah oh that was yeah
B	that was an undercover car
A	yeah
B	I thought I think they were really police and
A	I know yeah that crossed my mind but he said it was all very official and they had badges and paperwork and
B	yeah documents yeah
A	and they gave him a
B	yeah he his face yeah yeah I think he's just kind of having a look in his eye
A	yeah
B	have you spoken to him?
A	yeah we've corresponded a little bit on WhatsApp and erm done a few WhatsApp recorded voice messages
B	he's a huge fan
A	he is I quite like it so yeah it's good he's met a nice lady I can't remember her name
B	aha
A	but no and he's sharing a flat
B	like net met nicely
A	as in net met
A	as in having a relationship with
B	he doesn't mess around does he? Jesus
A	no he doesn't it's like right up here where are the single ladies?
B	mm mm
A	erm but he's living in a house with I think four men so oh wouldn't want to sit on that toilet seat
B	no
A	yeah
B	wouldn't fancy that at all
A	yeah
B	and I think he lived with four men in
A	yeah
B	good for him
A	erm I think they're teaching him about Italian cuisine so he'll be thoroughly enjoying that erm and on his first night he went straight from the airport into the forest by a lake for an all-night party and booked his accommodation at six in the morning and yeah that was sort of his welcome to Italy
B	good for him he's landed just lands on his feet doesn't he?
A	yeah
B	mm mm yeah
A	and and then to go and get it
B	yes I think a lot of people just simply don't
A	so yeah
B	often know what they want
A	yeah
A	erm
B	cross your legs
A	well I know
B	yeah
A	of an evening so shouldn't be a problem
B	I've never done sort of
A	it's just it's just drinking beer isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and eating fondue I don't know does it involve exactly
B	exactly that
A	mm
B	just drinking and dancing
A	yay
B	no I hope
B	tiny heads united
A	I know yeah and her little fifty-four inch head and proud and I funny thing is my brother is the other way round he has a massive head
A	a huge head so when we both had motorcycles I had trouble finding a
A	she's tiny
B	she's tiny tiny
A	yeah
B	yeah and her brother was at this party as well I think he's gay erm and he was sort of saying to me oh I'm not very religious but my sister and my mother are
A	oh
B	yeah
A	oh I wasn't aware of that
B	I think lots of well I don't know it depends how you define religious
A	yeah
B	and if you know going to church every Sunday makes you
A	no it doesn't
B	religious
A	it doesn't in my little bit of Northern Ireland where the whole community went to church
B	yeah exactly
A	but yeah I think that it's a more community thing and it's yeah well mind you
A	so as you know that makes you religious well I don't know yeah perhaps there's something to it but actually no they would light a candle for people or say a prayer for people but
B	aha
A	then if you say do you believe in god? do you believe in afterlife? do you believe you're a sinner? do you believe Jesus died to save you?
B	mm mm
A	then the answer is invariably no
B	yeah
A	I'm no sinner that's what pisses me off what more of a disempowering control mechanism
B	aha
A	for humanity can you possibly have by saying you're shit and you know you are? you were born that way
B	mm mm
A	and you have to repent and you've got so much to make up for I think bollocks isn't it much nicer to say to a baby and a small child you know you are a gift you are love incarnate you are perfection itself
B	that's nice
A	you are beauty you are the light of this world you are god incarnate if you want to use those terms how much more of a you know positive smiley happy woohoo
B	mm mm
A	kind of an upbringing are people going to have with that? but anyway to each their own
B	to each their own indeed
A	wow
B	ah even on Christmas Day and it was because I was very hungover but
B	and I just thought I don't go at any other time of year why should I go just cos it was Christmas?
A	yeah
B	erm I don't really I don't know I should probably have done it for her but
A	yeah but that's
B	she felt that strongly
A	that's a really shit reason to do something
B	mm
A	because you're no longer standing in your own truth you're sacrificing a part of yourself for somebody else's happiness
B	yeah exactly
A	I would wonder I mean your mum sounds to me like an intelligent woman I would think if you phrased it to her in those terms
B	yeah
A	she would probably think oh shit oh sorry about that
B	yeah true and we've talked about it before we've talked about religion and how I can't do it anymore don't want to do it it's not right I don't not only do I not believe in it but I actively disagree with the majority of it
A	oh yeah
B	wrong
A	me too I actively disagree I think anything that subjugates humanity or puts humans down
B	yeah
A	is just so wrong
B	mm mm
A	people are wonderful we are an aspect of the divine we are the divine expressing itself and learning about itself
B	is that man just selling jam out of the back of his car?
A	ah you maybe you don't know this because you don't come to my house much erm but there's a man who sits in a little put-you-up tent type thing selling fire extinguishers by the side of the road between
B	mm mm
A	like you'd take to a summer picnic sort of chair drinking his tea out of his flask waiting for a customer for a fire extinguisher
B	that's so nice
A	isn't that amazing?
B	who
A	I know
B	on fire
B	thank god you're here
C	yeah
B	outside
A	mm
B	and er near Zenith as well there's people who sit outside and sell stuff
A	yeah
B	good old Zenith it's a great little supermarket that
A	it is I really like it you've got everything there
B	yeah it's better than the Tesco
A	and I
B	yeah really good
A	of environmentally-friendly and organic products have you seen how cheap the the the coconut oil is?
B	yeah it is cheap
A	oh my god yeah
B	way cheaper than England
A	yeah and the Himalayan sea salt
B	yeah
A	and it's weird you can't buy or you can't easily buy a tin of beans you can't buy
B	you can't easily buy a tin of beans I find it fine and easy
A	well I can't no I can't fucking find them I know you know where they are and I just yeah they hide them when they see me coming but yeah or a tin of soup or you know certain convenience things that you would expect would be sold internationally but they're just not but you can get Himalayan sea salt and coconut oil easily
B	mm mm
A	you can get spirulina easily chia seeds easily
B	and they I don't see or consider Polish people to be especially erm
A	no
B	I think it's a lot more visible in England er people are far more healthy I mean lots of people are the exact opposite but you know?
A	I was just wondering if you get that because of the polarity?
B	yes possibly but you know there's sort of a Holland and Barrett everywhere
A	mm
B	lots of people are obsessed with fitness I see far more joggers in England than here
A	yeah
B	and I've spoken to students about this before
B	no but I mean all year round and I've spoken to students about it before and they said erm
A	oh
B	it's just not it's becoming a thing
A	oh it is becoming a thing?
B	yeah yeah in the most student
A	what a great name
B	head of logistics at er this
A	mm yeah
B	erm
A	where's the fire?
B	yeah
B	well
A	if it was the extinguisher man
B	er but now it's becoming more popular
A	mm
B	no girls
A	no?
B	not running really not
A	mm
B	don't know I suppose a lot of them don't have time when I talk to the core groups about exercise they're just saying oh we don't have time
A	I know
B	we
A	we work fifteen hours a day yeah
B	eh well this is inconvenient
A	I know I'm not quite sure why we have a queue of traffic I hope it's not all the way to
B	I know can we just see what's potentially there?
A	yeah erm no you can't cos cos I'm not well I'm not connected to the internet
B	no you can't
A	so it won't tell you about any traffic jams
B	no I'm just trying to zoom out and see
A	and now since we've stopped I think oh I really need a wee now which is a bit of a bugger I mean if it comes to it we can have a pee in the van erm I'll just have to empty it but it's not a problem so according to
B	mm mm
B	mm
A	so we can stop and get a coffee somewhere?
B	yeah we let's just see what happens with this
A	erm yeah it's a bit annoying though
B	let's just see not if there is any sort of traffic things but if there's like a town or I don't know junctions or type things coming up what do you see?
A	so zooming in ah zooming out ah
B	try and work out why
A	yeah keep an eye on the things at the side of the road cos cos when you've got a coffee shop coming up they quite often do have billboards
B	mm mm
A	but it doesn't look like there is a town by the side of the road ah that could be ah no that's just random houses I think
B	yeah
A	erm
B	Siberia
A	erm that probably looks favourite
A	a little
A	oh look and there's a knife and fork symbol oh and a P for parking
B	oh good that's good
A	oh right we're going there so parking area add as waypoint please
B	good
A	okay so we've added it as a waypoint start and
B	well we'll see how this
A	that's probably a Maccy D's or something
B	er anything's better than nothing though
A	indeed actually it's really not that far at all by the looks of this
B	oh good
A	if we were driving I would say two minutes or or less so
A	yeah look at this car number plate it ah it looks like it says potty or something
B	oh yeah
A	I like all the fours
B	four four four four
A	so we are moving oh that's good
A	okay so I'm just visualising a massive lorry that had missed its turn and needed to do like a
B	mm mm
A	in the middle of the road so all of the traffic had to stop while the lorry did the manoeuvre and now the lorry is moving and it's on its way so the traffic may now flow completely freely so there's my creative visualisation
B	good I'm thinking about it too
A	yeah and we're moving see this is brilliant now it'll take a little while to get up to speed cos you've got people like me in big vans who can't really accelerate that quickly but yeah we're going and it's all good
B	good
A	mm
B	good good good
A	yes well glad we sorted that out
B	otherwise we'd have a yellow snow situation
B	healthy slippers
B	I have brought my slippers they were five zloty and they're awful
A	I have as well
B	absolutely vile bought them last year in
A	why did you buy ugly slippers?
B	cos I just couldn't find any anywhere
A	aw
B	plus and I didn't want to spend a lot of money
A	haven't you seen the lady that stands outside in?
B	outside yeah
A	oh my god
B	I know I'm tempted
A	I think older Polish women must have loads of secret layers of fat
A	or just be wrapped up in hot water bottles
B	yes
A	cos they stand outside in like minus fifteen degrees Celsius
B	well I suppose they've had like eighty years to get used to the weather
A	yeah they maybe have
B	erm oh we are really near good good good
B	I saw the court man in the middle of town the other day
B	he's like
B	I was like oh Jesus I was on the phone
A	did you babble away at each other and not understand what the other was saying?
B	he just no thankfully I was on the phone to this woman who the hell was that?
A	I had lots of kisses off of my neighbour this morning it was lovely this is nice
B	ah that's nice
A	yeah she got me out of the shower to give me cake she's
B	what kind of cake was it?
A	oh there's a bit looks like a
B	aha
A	and there's a bit that looks like something else with sliced almonds and desiccated coconut
B	nice
A	but she's amazing and she bought me this erm thing the other day which I described it to
B	mm mm
A	but it's I thought roulade was just like cake with creamy stuff in
B	mm mm
A	erm I used to have a Polish friend in England who makes roulade at Christmas she makes chocolate roulade and and a jam roulade anyway
A	this was more like a sweet bread
B	aha
A	with chocolate rolled through it
B	oh nice
A	it's nice anyway I think she's a bit worried about me not eating or something bringing me cake but anyway so she got me out of the shower at
B	yeah
A	quarter past eight
B	people I don't know whether people worry that you don't eat or whether it's just a custom to ply people with food
A	yeah
B	my neighbour last year they used to you know he lived alone but whenever he went to his sister's house for lunch or whatever he would always come back with a bag of food for me
A	ah
B	and leave it outside my door
A	that's sweet
B	when I wasn't in yeah just go home to like a jar of coleslaw and sausage
B	thanks
A	look that's where
B	very nice oh nice
A	so that's where I will be living
B	excellent excellent have we gone
A	in no time
B	past the turn for there yet?
A	yeah I think we must have done because I erm I don't recognise this hill and this turn I think I'd have normally turned off by now
B	oh oh oh
A	oh that looks like that lorry must need to turn round again
B	maybe this is just traffic lights or something
A	ah
B	I don't know a while
A	oh no that's the lorry look it turned round
B	yeah it did good for them good good good
A	oh isn't this beautiful though? getting to look out across the valley
B	yeah nice
A	on a clear day you could probably see
B	it's beautiful
A	it really is
B	absolutely
A	mm and I like the drive to the
B	mm
A	but as you come round this hairpin bend this just vista of valleys and mountains opens up before you really really lovely and there was snow-peaked mountains back in September and October as well
B	goodness me
A	so so pretty
B	we did but only for a day
A	mm yeah
B	we had snow last year in April so
A	oh wow in
B	yeah in
A	yeah
B	it was my birthday
A	my gosh
B	it was Easter Monday and I opened the window
B	oh the curtains and it was snowing I was like fuck I'm going back to bed
B	that was like that was the worst time of living in
A	yeah?
B	when it was Easter so nothing was open for like four days
A	yeah forever yeah
B	er and it was my birthday and I was just alone
A	ah
B	yeah I know it's really sad erm
A	that's not going to happen this year
B	that's not going to happen this year
A	I was so grateful to you throwing a party for me for my birthday in December
B	yeah
A	yeah it was great but no I was really touched by that thank you very kind
B	oh you're very welcome any any any excuse for a
A	well in December
B	yeah
A	now oh no
B	I know I don't plan on having any parties until June
A	yeah
B	for the sake of our neighbours I'm still getting really the most
A	yeah uh oh
A	oh
B	and it's not me I'm not a loud party-throwing person
A	I know it's all whatever
B	but I've been tarred with the brush
A	maybe you need to give them a bit of sober
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think
A	yeah?
B	yes I don't think he's a party person
A	mm doesn't strike me as a partier
B	he doesn't really he doesn't well I think that's not true I think he probably is but he's not a an active
A	mm
B	he's a passive party person he'll go if it's
A	yeah but he won't throw one yeah
B	which is fair enough and I don't think he speaks to
A	yeah
B	all his friends are in
A	yeah
B	don't know
A	yeah I sort of miss erm I want to say dinner parties but that sounds a bit formal
B	yeah
A	informal dinner parties yeah
B	eating together
A	where people just a bit like we did the other day really
B	yeah
A	turn up with food everybody does a bit and everybody shares and then fuck off early in bed by ten perfect
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yes yes yes
A	oh wood sculptures
B	beautiful
B	absolutely great
A	so apparently seven hundred and fifty metres to restaurant
B	ah it's not looking
A	well I suppose we are fairly rural so
B	yeah
A	but erm actually maybe that's what's causing the slower traffic is with things pulling in and out of the restaurant
B	yeah maybe yeah
A	well I'm calling it a restaurant it's just a knife and fork
A	on a satnav picture yeah I must ask
B	clean your car
A	clean your car efficiently and effectively for not too much money yet in Poland it's kind of impossible erm I mean I don't mind cleaning the van myself but I maybe need somebody and I know you offered thank you to put coins in the thing to keep the water flowing
B	yeah
A	but also to read the instructions cos these things you know usually have a soap function
B	yeah
A	now where is parking? here we are I can pull in here can't I? yes
B	mm mm
A	I just need to make sure there's nothing coming behind so I pull in after this car ah out the way
A	okay and we're here
B	and we're here
A	so if I reverse oh shit I hope we're going to get up that again
B	we will
A	if I reverse in here yeah exactly well said erm then we're pointing downwards
A	the winter tyres are fabulous
A	er what's that place? that looks more like I don't know
B	mm mm
B	that looks nice yes
A	if your gym legs will cope with it
B	I
A	oh I'm a bit close to that car
B	in the gym there's shitloads of stairs it's awful the weights room's downstairs and the you know the reception's upstairs but to get into the building you've got to go up the stairs
B	just not very nice
A	okay so goodbye
B	bye
A	bye
