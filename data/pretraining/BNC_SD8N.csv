A	yeah so drama lesson today working on the monologues
B	yeah
A	so I'm doing the piece from Little Voice
B	that's it yeah
A	yeah er it was good
B	was it?
A	it was good yeah she just she was getting all of us to show like a little segment of it we had to learn it and do it
B	right
A	and if I'd known I probably would have learned the whole monologue beforehand but I hadn't I hadn't realised she was going to ask us to perform it off script so
B	ah
A	just did a little bit like
B	yeah
A	the first I don't know third of it
B	right
A	and erm yeah cos I've got screaming in mine I have to scream
A	so er I
B	yeah
A	she was like do you want to go into the corridor I was like yes I will go into the corridor so I don't disrupt everyone with my screaming every five minutes
A	erm so I did but then you awkwardly had people walking through and erm
B	okay
A	which I can actually have when I'm performing it I can buy a load of records break them and put them on the floor
B	break them
A	to make the scene which is cool
B	yeah
A	erm but I
A	and it would just be there and they'd walk past and I I'd have stopped and I still have my hand in that position
B	right
A	it must have looked so strange
B	bit bizarre yeah
A	but I think it I think it went really well like she
B	yeah?
A	I was the last one who had time to do it in the lesson I think a couple of people have to do it next time cos they didn't have time today
B	mm mm
A	but erm
B	yeah
A	like a TA
B	mm hm
A	and erm they were they gave us feedback afterwards and like I think I think they quite liked mine although she was saying you still need to strengthen your northern accent a bit
B	oh great
A	I actually forgot to do it on the first line
B	right
A	I got the first line in and I was like yeah I'm meant to be doing a northern accent switch into that quickly
A	but erm yeah
B	what was your first line?
A	oh it's erm
B	mm mm hm mm hm
A	but yeah and then I scream
B	right
A	which is fun er yeah she thought I had a reasonably original take on it and banned me from watching the movie cos she said that would ruin it
B	oh ah
A	and I'd end up doing it like the movie
B	yeah
A	but erm the yeah
A	she gave me like a few pointers of things I needed to do like I do some muttering
B	mm
A	and it needs to be muttering but muttering so that it's distinct and audible
B	tinct yeah aha yeah
A	which yeah is
B	right
A	cos you you still they still need to be able to hear it
B	yeah
A	it's crazy but erm and also er her and
B	class right okay
A	cos I was saying to her that I'd read up about the play online but there wasn't much about it cos I we have to write this like piece about it
B	mm
A	and talk about like social historical
B	context
A	and political context I was like well there there isn't any? and she was like oh yeah there's a bit but you can like in saying you can talk about the whole working class
B	working men's club and mm mm
A	and yeah
B	yeah absolutely
A	and erm and you can compare her to other characters er like and the stereotypes of the northern woman that are in these other plays
B	right right
A	or that aren't in these other plays
B	yeah
A	and yeah so that that'll be interesting
B	oh that'll be good to do what were the other? some of the other plays?
A	oh I got road which is by the same author Jim Cartwright
B	yeah
A	and Hangmen
B	oh I've not heard of that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah cos that's the thing you know? the whole erm
A	yeah
B	erm you know? even like where dad is from in
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	you can imagine it was a very you know working class area and a heck of a lot of working class clubs and everything and Wales was very much like that all the miners you know?
A	yeah yeah
B	and erm that was sort of where their the epicentre if you like of their social life was really
A	yeah and like it plays a big part in er The Rise and Fall of Little Voice cos erm
B	right mm
A	this
B	mm hm
B	which is very good Jane Horrocks great do you know who else she plays? Jane Horrocks?
A	no
B	er Bubble in Ab Fab who is the secretary of erm Edina is it? erm yeah yes
A	oh right
B	and she's so very different to the character in Little Voice
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	she's
A	oh how exciting have you seen the er the trailer for Finding Dory?
B	Finding?

B	mm
A	really nice bookmarks are printed onto that almost like cardboard type
B	oh yeah ply isn't it? oh do you mean cardboard or ply?
A	it's not it's not wood
B	yeah but it's like a ply wood?
A	it's like a
B	are you talking about those ones we saw at erm at the er oh god my brain has gone tonight at the festival that we went to recently?
A	latitude?
A	oh my god it was that one oh Jesus
B	oh yeah
A	yeah not those
B	but oh okay so not that
A	cos they're like wood but these are like
B	okay oh right yeah
A	but it's not cardboard cos it's not like
B	right yeah
A	it's like the thickness of cardboard
B	okay got you aha
A	I've got a
B	mm mm hm
A	I've forgotten
B	black one?
A	yeah
B	mm yeah you see I'd think that that was more like wood as well that one
A	it's not it's not wood though
B	well you know? a ply or something
A	you want to know what happened to that?
B	what?
A	erm er I came home duh duh duh went out the next day bookmark is lying in puddle outside front door
A	or I don't know if it was a puddle but it was wet through
B	oh no
A	I was like
A	or or maybe it was I'd dropped it in the morning and came back to it
B	ah was it ruined?
A	kind of but not completely
B	ah oh
A	it's just a bit funny now
A	but I mean it's still functioning
A	no cos I think it's not like yeah it's
B	I know yeah yeah yeah
A	I don't know what I'm doing with my hands to try and gesture this I always get compliments on this T-shirt
B	do you?
A	my Sherlock one
A	yeah which is nice
B	well I should hope so the amount you paid for it
A	yeah I know but I love it
B	it is very good yeah is it the same on the back again?
A	no there's nothing on the back
B	oh
A	mm
B	well if there'd have been something on the back we'd have probably paid even more
A	hey at least it's not band merch
B	yeah yeah
A	band merch is even more expensive
B	yeah
A	except for my
B	signed yeah
A	and he's going to LA to produce it which is great because more music for me
B	mm mm yeah yeah oh
A	yeah that T-shirt was alright that was like eight pounds
B	eight pound?
A	yeah
B	that was cheap wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah how much was that again? twenty-two?
A	eighteen
B	eighteen plus postage?
A	that was including postage
B	ah right yeah yeah
A	so it was like I don't know
B	I don't think I've ever paid anywhere near that amount for a T-shirt
A	but I love it so much mummy
B	well that's good you're getting good usage out of it and plenty of compliments like you say
A	yeah
B	so you know
A	and and cos it's not like anyone else's shirt or T-shirt
B	mm hm
A	I'll probably never meet someone with this T-shirt
B	no quite
A	yeah and it's and it's got like ten different Sherlock references on it
B	you know what I've just noticed which I hadn't noticed before?
A	what?
B	the smiley there
A	yeah cos that's do you not? that's on their wallpaper
B	ah
A	in two hundred and twenty-one B he's just like casually done it?
B	right
A	and then the man with the yellow dash over his eyes is from the blind banker where somebody's
B	you know all the stories here
A	somebody steals I can't remember what it was quite but there's a cypher and somebody
B	mm
A	and on the portrait that covers the safe erm
B	oh yeah
A	and it's like a it's part of a code
B	yes I remember that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then and then there's the apple which has got IOU on it which is from ah is it from? yeah it's from The
B	oh I remember yeah
A	and he carves IOU into it and then he eats it
B	yeah yeah
A	it's like oh
B	yeah that was a bit weird that wasn't it? god your recall is brilliant oh my goodness yeah
A	it's Sherlock of course it's brilliant and then and then it's just London skyline and then silhouettes
B	right yeah
A	and then all in Benedict Cumberbatch's profile
B	impressed yeah
A	you would have paid that amount for it if you liked it as much as I did wouldn't you?
B	well yeah you're probably right there
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	I'm trying to think of an equivalent for you and I can't
B	yeah
A	which is kind of concerning what was your favourite band when you were my age?
B	oh there's so many that's the thing I've always been quite broad but erm when I was your age let's think ah
A	and would you have paid eighteen pounds for a really super cool the cure shirt that nobody else had?
A	yeah yeah the equivalent of that
B	er
A	I guess maybe it's a bigger thing now using clothes to like express like a specific
B	yeah
A	erm taste for a thing
B	I mean T-shirts have always been that way
A	yeah
B	there's always been a strong kind of you know teen sort of thing to do and not just teen you know?
A	yeah
B	going on erm so even in my day
A	even in your day
B	it was a very popular thing to do but yeah I mean in terms of merchandise sort of outside of music as well
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	which that clearly is but I mean you know?
A	I
B	yeah the availability wasn't there
A	yeah
B	and I guess the streams weren't there? that there are now you know? you know
A	like you get so many fan designs now
B	exactly yeah
B	yeah
B	mm hm
A	for majority of things
B	yeah and fan are and everything wouldn't have had such a broad erm
A	oh it couldn't have had
B	channel as it does now you know?
A	no no no
B	the pipelines weren't there dear the pipelines
A	yeah yeah
B	mm mm so yeah mm
A	and it yeah it's just like someone can come up to me and be like ah you like Sherlock? me too
B	yeah so you tend to
A	yeah
B	music
A	yeah yeah
B	more so than programmes but yeah
A	I don't know like I see a lot of people like my friend has a supernatural T-shirt and you probably don't know supernatural
B	I've heard of it yeah
A	probably from me
B	yeah
A	it's like a massive American programme and she has a supernatural T-shirt that's like a fan design and she loves it
B	yeah yeah mm
A	doctor who ones you see a lot
B	mm hm
A	oh my god Harry Potter ones but they're always the same Harry Potter ones
B	are they?
A	yeah it's always the the Hogwarts crest generally
B	right
A	I'm trying to think
B	is there not much kind of copyrighting over potter anyway? or is there still like tons of fan stuff available? cos I would have thought
A	there's loads of Potter stuff
B	is there?
A	oh my
B	yeah?
A	yeah some of it's on my Christmas list no but like especially like posters
A	I don't know so much no there are T-shirts as well
B	mm
A	yeah there are
B	mm
A	there's there's a there are really nice erm Expecto Patronum ones Expecto Patronum is a is is a spell
B	mm
A	and you you create it's like a guardian
A	and it it protects you from these things called Dementors
B	yes
A	you know them? they suck your soul out by kissing you it's really weird
B	yes yes yes
A	and so if you can do the Patronus Charm then you have the
B	right
A	Patronus and it it protects you and it's like
B	aha
A	it's shape is like generally an animal which is like
B	mm hm
A	particular to you
B	oh okay yeah
A	which is cool
B	yeah if you had a Patronus what? what animal would
A	I don't know it would probably be like a bunny which is very
A	which is slightly irritating cos it's like a bunny gonna protect me
B	aha
A	but erm yeah I did think of something else at one point but I can't think what it was
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm yeah I have not seen all of your Christmas list
A	aha
B	but I haven't got to the bottom of it yet it's so long
B	yeah I know
B	yeah no I know you did a good selection of things erm but I remember seeing yeah there was some Potter bags wasn't there? tote bags
A	oh yeah there was a tote bag which is quite nice
B	mm you do like your totes don't you?
A	they're useful for carrying books in
B	yeah
A	erm what was I going to say as well? I really want something with a Ravenclaw design on it
B	right
A	so hard to find
B	so badly
A	yeah
B	oh is it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	there's a there's an official er Ravenclaw like bag patch which is quite nice
B	oh yeah that was on your list wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but then there's there's one there's a really common design for Ravenclaw stuff and it's horrible
B	oh
A	so it's like I have to avoid that design
B	avoid that one so the patch you you put on the isn't is not common design no
A	the patch is nice no
B	no
A	and all the ones that I've got on there are not not that
B	right right
A	cos I think I've got like a couple of T-shirts and stuff
B	aha
B	mm
C	yeah
B	just keep
A	like a lot
A	what?
B	the dryer
A	oh no this one's not cracked
B	oh that's good
A	this one on the reverse
B	mm hm
A	it does that
B	oh that's odd isn't it?
A	yeah
B	little bits
A	yeah
B	mm oh well
A	there we go
B	and it seems intact on the front
A	yeah yeah which is the important thing I should certainly hope so
B	indeedy
A	yeah
B	oh dear
