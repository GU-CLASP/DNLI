C	would turn around to me though and be like what have you done to someone to make them do this?
D	yeah
D	I'm not being funny but why why was it in the kitchen
B	someone must really fucking hate them
unknown_female	mm
B	well the
D	I think that
B	like what cos they were questioning me
A	who was?
A	really
B	and I answered it cos I didn't cos I didn't know about their Ipad or laptop at this point and they were like oh someone's done this or like what the fuck like? who the fuck'd do that? and then they were
B	all this other stuff
unknown_female	thank you
B	and all that and like
C	mm
B	but like they were asking me questions like what time did you get back and?
A	yeah
B	were our door open did you see anyone? and like well no I don't pay any attention to your flat at all

D	we all
C	yeah
D	well us two certainly were

A	it's weird I find it really strange like after hearing all this stuff about all the events from their side of the story
unknown_female	mm
A	d'you know what I mean like?
D	like
A	it doesn't do them any favours
D	from from the outsider's point of view cos I
B	no
D	but especially hearing about this laptop thing
C	I I knew before I met you
D	I
D	like I don't think I would even go to the extent of putting somebody's like Ipad
A	no
D	cos if somebody had done that to me I'd be fucking livid like beyond
C	mm that is so unfair
unknown_female	yeah
E	like that's what'd stick in my head?
unknown_female	yeah
D	it's not just that though like why would you even bother like?
E	well you're hurting yourself
D	yes okay you don't like them they don't like you but that
B	yeah
D	like
B	but I I don't think I
D	no

B	yeah
A	piggy
B	who did that?
B	it's so funny
B	it wasn't me
B	for about ten minutes and
B	cos I were at
B	and he were just like who the fuck are you? and like she just left and I'm like why the fuck is some random girl walking around my bedroom?
A	whaaat?
A	that's real weird
B	like
unknown_female	yeah
B	because if
A	cos I don't think they think it I think they just think you're the enemy and that's it
D	they obviously need to take a good look at themselves then
B	really seriously they do because I've got more
D	yeah to be in that state like
C	you'll never have to see them again though
A	exactly
B	I fucking hope not I hope not
