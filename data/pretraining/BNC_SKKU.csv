A	how come it's busy? just in general
B	loads of calls and stuff
A	the moment you're yeah the moment you're here it's like ah
B	loads of calls
A	oh
B	how was your day?
A	erm how was my day? it was fine it was just more like a balancing act between my new job and my old job and
B	mm
A	yeah nothing particularly exciting but just
A	ever
B	great
A	and it's just did you even it's like you it's when someone writes instructions when they know what to do?
B	yeah
A	they don't write instructions for somebody who will have no idea what they're talking about and it's just
B	she obviously thinks she's very
A	she's an idiot
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	you'll get used to it
A	yeah just feels like she's it feels like it should it feels like it should be much later in the week
A	weeks always go quickly at the moment
B	they do
A	never it'll get quicker and quicker until we get old and die
B	when we retire it'll slow down
A	yeah true
B	oh
A	yeah but she's quite happy about it actually
B	well I guess they've dicked her around so much yeah
A	yeah and I think they're gonna have the garage converted and then grandad's gonna come and erm
B	okay
A	live at our house so
B	yeah I had all that lowdown when she was here what she like
A	yeah when I was late
B	when you were late or not
A	but not late yeah
B	so
A	oh yeah she definitely was like in the mindset that she wanted to be made redundant if they she hadn't it would have ruined like all her plans
A	yeah no
A	you've got me in a job?
A	and I've actually got to do some work?
B	not lady of leisure anymore
B	she'll quite like being a lady of leisure
A	me too but I don't think it would be particularly good for her
B	oh no it won't be good for her but it
A	like a lazy person who has no like obligation to do anything
A	is not very good
A	exactly
B	well it was bloody long it's like er erm who did I ring first? oh the law the
A	yeah
B	and they were like oh this isn't our department so can you call back? and I was like okay that's really helpful and they weren't really
A	yeah of course yeah
B	and then I rang the council and they said for me to ring Citizens Advice even though
A	even though they sent us through a letter
B	yeah
A	being like if you need any help?
B	I think I think the guy that I spoke to was an idiot basically
A	okay
B	which was fun
A	yeah
B	erm so basically
A	yeah
B	she was actually quite rude and it really got on my nerves
A	really?
B	yeah like just annoying
A	yeah
B	so she was just like erm
A	she could
B	take legal action against us
A	yeah
B	if we haven't met the contract
A	which no offence if she's not gonna actually make er she's not gonna take the whole erm repossession seriously I doubt if she'll take us to court but I get the point yeah
B	yeah just in case
A	yeah
B	I mean we're not about to go to court
A	no
A	yeah
B	erm so I rang Shelter and they
A	yeah
B	sort of said erm if we're in a
A	oh okay
B	so we'll just have to pay the lender anyway
A	yeah
B	and it would've been a binding contract if the lender was happy that it was it was a tenancy mortgage then it's a binding contract cos they're aware of the situation
A	yeah
B	it wouldn't be a binding contract if it wasn't a
A	tenancy
B	tenancy mortgage erm and we can find that out the agency might know that or
A	well it's worth asking the question isn't it?
B	yeah or we just tell them that if
A	mm
B	then we have the right to leave anyway because
A	okay
B	she's not our landlady anymore
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	cos I'm not I I don't know
A	the legalities of it
B	the language
A	yeah yeah
B	it's really hard so
A	oh okay
B	and I did actually look into that that contract thing isn't what what what we thought it is anyway
A	oh is it not?
B	I I googled it it's not
A	what
B	it means that the tenancy can be ended if she wants to sell her house basically
A	oh I see
B	erm so we haven't even got that clause so what we can do is it's called I always forget what it's called but it's something where you basically what what they said to us when we when they said that we could move out er in December and not pay
A	mm
B	that's called a something er it begins with an S but I can't remember what it's called a surrender a surrender
A	yeah
B	erm of the tenancy but they have the right to change that at any time
A	oh
B	if and and if they decide that that's not gonna happen anymore that's not gonna happen anymore
A	oh
B	if it's not in writing as well
A	yeah
B	you have to sign it both have to sign it and agree to the terms
A	what in December?
B	if it gets repossessed
A	but we don't have to pay for January?
B	no we wouldn't cos the lender would probably it would be in our their interest to get us out anyway so
A	oh I see so
B	so if it gets repossessed you can ring the lender and say we wanna move out on this day and then they can
A	okay
B	cos with the surrender if if they agree to the terms then we can move out without any rent anyway
A	so what does the surrender include? what does it?
B	the surrender just says that we're ending our tenancy on this date and that's it it's it's basically if you so for example she she put it to me like in terms of a phone contract so if if you have a phone contract out and it's coming to the end and at the end sort of you say erm I'm not gonna pay the last two months
A	yeah
B	because I'm signing a new contract and taking out a new contract with you
A	oh okay
B	so basically there has to be something in their interest
A	but we're not taking out a new contract with them
B	no I know but it's got to be something from their interests for it to happen so for example they've got new tenants coming or erm I don't know she wants a month to redecorate or something like it's got to be something that's in their interest
A	okay
B	so we haven't really got anything of that
A	no
B	but I mean it's worth a try if if we actually cos we haven't really explicitly said that we want to move out on a particular date have we? I mean we have but we haven't officially
A	yeah
B	emailed them and told them this
A	I said we wanted well we were gonna have we envisage I said the
B	yeah
A	the sixteenth and seventeenth
B	and I've I've confirmed that with her anyway and she said that's fine
A	yeah
B	we'll confirm that nearer the time but that's what I mean we haven't really got any rights in that
A	yeah
B	cos they are the ones that are releasing us from the tenancy
A	yeah
B	so basically I think our next move we we we can't really do anything until we oh that's another thing we we can't find out whether it's been repossessed or not because it's not anything to do with us
A	but can we find out if it's a binding contract?
B	if they have the paperwork but no otherwise not they might not have that paperwork
A	so could we ring them and ask them if they could we email them and ask them if they have that contract?
B	uhu well it's it's not them it's kind of the the estate er whether the woman has taken out a mortgage that makes it a binding contract so she
A	okay
B	not a normal mortgage if it's a normal mortgage then it's not a binding contract
A	and how do and we can't know that?
B	if they have that information but again if they'd protections in for this into this they might not give us that information anyway
A	true
A	no
B	cos a lot of the stuff that I was looking at online as well is all to do with landlady rights and landlord rights and stuff and it's nothing really they don't really look at the tenants
A	we ought we could ask when they're expecting the new tenants to move in
B	yeah
A	cos I very much think it's unfair that if they're that's if we move out and the the new tenants move in like the day before and they haven't
B	I don't think they know though to be honest and I don't think
A	oh do they not?
B	I don't think they
A	repossession
B	so until we know when they're moving in and until we know what's gone on we're not I don't think we should pay the rent on the sixteenth anyway I mean we'll pay it if we need to but we just won't
A	pay it bang on the sixteenth
B	no
A	well we should find out by the
B	probably not cos it's gonna come out by by post so it won't come out like
A	do we have the right to know whether she attended the hearing?
B	no
A	oh
B	we have no right to know like anything
A	well yeah obviously
B	but they'll notify the outcome by post
A	mm okay
B	so really at the moment it's looking like we'll probably have to pay
A	disaster okay
B	but
A	it's just so poorly organised by them
B	I know they don't know whether they're coming or going really
A	cos we were we were just
B	I know
A	at the
B	but then I think they've got the rights haven't they? so I think they were they knew but I think that since this has happened
A	it's just so unfair
B	it's really annoying
A	yeah
B	but they were so sneaky about that I think
A	well if you look how
B	which
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	for a bill from like April like I'm sorry
B	not likely
A	yeah
B	so
A	but they'd still charge us wouldn't they?
B	no no that's the whole point it's a surrender if if it becomes the whole
A	well we can ask could we pay up until January the first or pay up until December the thirty-first and then the new tenant pays on the first well and give and ask the estate agents to offer the new tenants the option of moving in you know straight away in January?
B	yeah
A	it's just so
B	I'm sure if we
A	spoken to the tenants like the new ones this would have been like well like we could have just altered it ourselves
B	I know
A	but the estate agent is so shit
B	and it's annoying that we can't talk to the landlady as well
A	yeah cos I'm pretty sure if they actually asked the
B	no
A	true
B	not for much longer
A	no it won't be for much longer will it really?
B	going to
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm if
A	yeah me too yeah
B	but
A	yeah I was going to anyway
B	I thought you wanted to live in here if if
A	well I was going to because it was gonna be a pain but erm I actually I'm gonna move into the place in
B	mm so that's actually a lot yeah
A	so it's a lot cheaper in the long term
B	mm
A	so even though it will cost me extra what? three hundred odd quid to stay in this stupid shitty house
B	yeah I guess well until after er but
