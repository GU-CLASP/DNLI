A	yeah I know well I've only had a
B	we're the same I only had a bowl of porridge
A	I only had a slice of toast
C	yeah I mean you last quite a while on a slice of toast mum
A	well I do I know
C	although I think you keep topped up with tea or something instead
A	I do
A	well I was up on rehab yesterday I could drink more tea as well cos I had so much more time
C	mm
A	and course I wasn't so busy either and all I kept wanting to do was go to the loo
A	whereas normally I only go a couple of times in a in a twelve hour shift
C	ah do you?
A	yeah cos I think I get where you're rushing around so much I think you get I think I get a bit dehydrated at work
C	yeah I'm sure you do
B	what's this bloody
C	that's why you need to keep a
C	cos I just spend a lesson drinking water
A	mm
B	must be roadworks up here or something
A	yeah oh I dunno
B	this is a dual carriageway
A	just mm
B	oh it goes into one look well that's stupid innit?
C	ah should have been in the other lane then dad you'd have been up there half an hour ago
B	I know
A	oh there's no point changing now because it goes in up here
B	I am now it's lights lights
C	now we in
A	oh
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	I thought
B	welcome to
A	yeah
C	the new film that's coming out
A	what stick it up your jacksy?
C	yeah one of the er dwarfs say says it and we said to
C	and I was like no it just means stick it up your bum hole
C	that's what we call a jacksy and we were just like where on earth did that word come from?
C	I don't know
A	er
C	I'm sure we've got all kinds of words that aren't really real I mean they're real but
B	yeah
C	confident?
A	god help us
B	yeah course I am
C	just don't drive as fast as you do in England
C	mm
B	than where we're going
C	but you're on the other side of the road is what you've got to remember
B	yeah
C	you're taking this car I assume?
A	mm
B	yes
C	don't wanna be pulling up in anything too old do you? getting your disabled parking I'll have to email them all again I'll do it anyway just to make sure
B	they've gone back to bloody red again
C	reservations go through okay but I'll drop them all an email just checking that you
A	well I mean they've all come through the
C	no it doesn't mean that they still you can still arrive to a guest house and they've overbooked or something
A	oh
C	it's better to make sure you check
A	mm
C	it's just good that they know who you are when you arrive really
A	when you arrive
C	makes things quicker and easier saves explaining stuff
A	yeah I phoned that erm
C	oh yeah was it
A	yeah yeah it was
A	yeah erm cos I phoned
C	oh
A	and I didn't phone till half three
C	ah
A	so whoever I spoke to said can you phone tomorrow?
C	yeah
A	I said oh I can't tomorrow cos I was on a twelve hour shift again
C	mm
A	she said Friday I said yes I can phone Friday after nine thirty so I phoned while we were
C	oh so you did it in the car this morning?
A	yeah yeah
C	ah so that's why you were so like ah got an interview
C	so when is that?
A	next Tuesday at ten o'clock
C	okay you got to go over to the
A	yeah
C	yeah?
A	yeah
C	ah and is it with
A	I well I think so and I said cos I've still got the erm application form I so I said oh I've printed the application form off now so I can bring that oh yes she said that that's good that'll save some time
C	oh right good so yeah that makes you look keen as well doesn't it?
A	yeah and it saves me having to post it off doesn't it?
C	hopefully I mean
A	call me
C	and they understand that you're still working at the moment which isn't any bad thing is it?
A	no
C	that means you're committed
A	yeah
C	so and but thankfully only working part time hours or whatever so you can go for an interview
A	yeah yeah
C	but I don't see as you said I can't see how it's any worse really
A	no
C	yeah cos they're in their own home for a start yeah some it could be some really basic stuff couldn't it like
A	yeah
C	shower them or which would be the other end or just take them shopping or something can't it?
A	yeah or even sometimes it is
C	housework
A	just making sure they take their medication or doing them a light meal or something
C	or something yeah yeah
A	exactly
C	you haven't got you haven't got bells ringing from the other patients or anything?
A	no no
C	I guess what it might be it's it's the same amount of hours or whatever cos of having to drive and stuff but the actual contact time isn't so erm stressful it's not so constant surely once if you go go between houses you have time to you know take a break for ten minutes or something at least you're sat down
A	yeah
C	so I don't see I just the only thing it might be is getting time off cos you might feel a bit more committed to the individual
A	mm
C	so I don't know how it works for like Christmas and stuff like that like you do you go round for Christmas
A	I don't know
C	do the family take care of is that the time when they you might not have to do that?
A	I don't know what'd happen
C	but then at least popping to a house isn't the same as having to
A	do a twelve to twelve
C	staying in the same place for twelve hours maybe I don't know
A	er apparently erm they always used to make Christmas rotas so you go towards straight over towards
C	yeah?
A	erm they used to make Christmas Day
C	oh right yeah so no one did twelve hours or anything like that
A	but but erm
C	oh really?
A	yeah
C	who wants to do that on Christmas Day?
A	I know
C	that's a bit harsh isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
C	even if it's just spending it with their er like adult family it's still Christmas it's a shame cos we don't have many festivities in this country
A	no
B	got a funeral up the front now
C	yeah not having much luck with the traffic are we?
B	not through here we ain't jesus
C	time's not seem to be going down as quickly as we're moving
B	where's it all coming from?
A	well it's
B	why aren't they at work?
C	it's school holidays isn't it? as well more people take time off this time of yeah it's a Friday
C	er
C	don't mind it was fifteen years ago so you know
C	I thought cos it came up about obviously parking and stuff and
A	they can't
C	no they get tickets quite often I think it's partly it might be because they take liberties with where they can park I don't know if they find it if they find a pay and pay and display
A	mm
C	so maybe there's just so many of them they're really they're a private business aren't they?
A	it's
B	third exit?
C	so it's not a public service or anything oh the signs look like they're going over there
A	it's more or less straight
C	which way are you going towards?
B	that that one up here
C	no it's the left yeah
C	still eighteen miles from here isn't it?
A	yeah
C	said she might be commuting into
A	especially if this this'd be the dark the route it's gonna be busy isn't it?
C	hour's drive or something at this pace
A	yeah
C	ah probably won't be that but she's erm they phoned me last night as well actually about seven o'clock er
A	oh did they?
C	did a joint phone call with me which was quite nice
C	but I'd not long
C	I said no so the first night in here and you've had three phone calls
C	yeah it's just nice people being nice so we're just not used to having a mobile phone
A	that second text I sent is
C	never got it
A	no
C	did it deliver? did you get a delivery report?
A	no and it's not on my phone anymore so I'm not quite sure what happened there
C	did you send it from work?
A	yeah
C	don't know I mean it should be in your sent box do you have a sent box? a sent folder? or like an out box or whatever
A	well is it?
C	yeah but I mean you could have sent it and it just got like you never had any signal so it never actually sent or something
A	yeah but then it should send when I've got signal shouldn't it?
C	oh right yeah probably is that how it works?
A	yeah
C	yeah I don't know nowadays
A	well I couldn't have done perhaps I I must have got disturbed I suppose and erm
C	I did wonder I I mean I had to
B	well I wanted to let you have peace and quiet
C	yeah I know you were being
B	trying to be you so
C	hassling
B	hassling you
C	no we were expecting the phone call
B	well I was said I'll wait till mum comes home
C	I just I didn't realise
C	cos he knows he's picking me up in a
A	did he?
C	yeah
A	what's
C	between er Belgium and
A	oh yeah
A	yeah well I thought we'd probably cos I if I still have the two weeks off
C	yeah
A	might as well have a day
C	have a day trip to the coast
A	yeah
C	cos erm when will that be? I'll be in uni won't I but off on well if my schedule doesn't change I'm off on Wednesdays and Fridays so maybe you can come down on a Wednesday
A	mm
C	but I did get an email through
C	I'm a little bit annoyed about it if that's the case I'm happy to do it but I'd rather do it in my lecture time than give myself extra hours of studying do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
C	and I've got a feeling it's gonna there's gonna be some real abstract lesson er languages there so it's not gonna be anything easy or anything new to learn and it doesn't matter how well you learn it but I've still gotta go through the process in order to write my diary thing it's like
C	but hopefully I'll have the Wednesday off so either come to you or you can come to me
B	have you done anything to the laptop to make it better?
C	no not yet because we haven't had the internet have we? so
A	for sale
C	what's that our new laptop?
A	that's your new one
C	yeah it's on Windows eight point one which is similar to yours
A	yeah
C	and
A	what than eight?
C	well no no it's just better than the Windows before
A	ah
C	he said it is really good
A	they look the same to me I don't really know the difference between the two to be honest but the way you've the way you can use Windows eight or Windows eight point one with that like application looking desktop screen does save you a hell of a lot of time that you that is your start bar
B	we've got Windows eight eight point one now added
C	oh you updated it did you?
B	yeah I done it last night
C	so next time I'm home I might give you a quick lowdown but then I did it depends what you use your computer for you you don't really use it for much
A	no we don't do we?
C	but for us it's good because when you turn on your computer everything's already there for you to click on so if you click on your mail application
A	ah
C	which saves you the whole time of going to the internet and opening it it you can save documents on there and stuff stuff it's it's just there it's just faster they call it your start screen because before you used to go to start in the bottom left corner didn't you?
A	yeah
C	and that brought up everything well now you don't have to do that that is what is on your screen
A	oh
C	that's the whole idea of it that is your start bar
A	oh
C	so once you get kind of over that and you get used to how you have to click and drag things around the screen that's not that bad at all he seems quite happy with it so
A	good
C	yeah I mean
A	what did he pay for that one?
C	three fifty
A	oh that's not bad
C	on on from Amazon yeah it was on sale but yeah so not bad at all I mean it's not I think it feels a bit flimsy as an actual laptop I guess they're getting lighter and lighter anyway it's Lenovo it's a Chinese company
A	oh
C	and er some people love it and some people like buy the products and it doesn't work
C	so it's a bit hit and miss but overall they get good reviews
A	ah
C	as good as any other company and for that price it's gonna do what we need it to do for the next couple of years so can't really grumble erm but yeah it's definitely yeah it's fine three fifty can't complain but really it's I mean we call it our laptop or
C	he got he wanted to show me it show me everything and I just don't find it very exciting
C	he's
A	ah
C	yeah basically he still gets excited about things like that organising stuff on the
A	there's a there's a word now for erm the antiques that men go for
C	oh is there?
A	mantiques
C	mantiques
C	what are mantiques then?
B	that is
A	all things like I suppose er
C	mm
A	model
C	antiques
A	vintage model I dunno
C	mm
C	I'll have to google that one can I have some water please?
A	but they've they've used it on erm Bargain Hunt before
C	yeah I'm sure they have Bargain Hunt's gotta find ways of becoming more and more entertaining
B	well yeah but it
A	fancy
C	I know he's really good at things like that
C	I feel that's what I dunno er he does notice people's hair
C	always before I do
B	what a crappy way to come jesus
C	ah yeah it's starting to rain now er god what's the time?
A	they're still saying twelve thirty-three on here
B	is it?
A	mm
C	oh right so that's the oh yeah of course it is
B	well it updates itself doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	oh we used to just read maps before though people managed didn't they?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	it's not
B	on the other old satnav it would tell you how many miles you had to go
A	no
C	is this not a?
B	this gives you the time but not the mileage
C	is this your second satnav then?
B	yeah
A	yeah this one's
B	this is the new one
A	I got this one for cos for Europe as well you see
C	oh
A	whereas the other one wasn't
C	good so you'll be fine in Belgium
A	hopefully
B	hopefully
C	get off at
B	yeah
C	I mean can you have you tried looking into Europe on it?
B	no
A	no what on the satnav?
C	yeah well
A	we'll have to won't we? we'll have to
C	I don't know how to
A	why's he coming over?
B	I don't know why
C	there's a dent in the back of his car
A	yeah
B	that's probably why
C	oh
B	yes
C	why are these people are we gonna have to get in er
B	probably I don't know
A	oh yeah
B	we'll have to go round the roundabout now
A	well cut in

C	might be a few things cor look at the caravans
A	you're not gonna be able to are you here?
B	yeah
C	there were some nice big spaces back there
A	yeah
C	yeah why didn't you just do it back there when there was a bloody space?
B	oh dear oh dear oh dear

C	she's got another one coming in from the other side
B	you watch this black one you watch this black one pull in he won't give a shit
C	oh dear oh dear
B	well I tell you what we saved an hour's journey there
C	do you reckon?
A	an hour? you reckon we saved an hour there do you?
C	did you see an hour come off the satnav? time's only going up on it at the minute
B	well it would have been a lot longer now if we had a what's her name?
B	yeah
C	you you could you come down on that part of the A
B	I don't think so
C	when you come from
A	no
B	you can go
C	what A three seven?
B	no
C	dear oh dear what was
B	I'm wondering if we could have gone straight on and then gone round the roundabout you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	well supposing there ain't another roundabout you go straight on
C	yeah what? Can't just guess these things dad
B	we'd have gone to erm

C	more family and friends in Italy
A	and then she started in her hair apprentiship at a hairdressers at
C	oh

C	oh no so she wasn't at that one too long then?
A	no I mean after I don't know a few oh there's
C	oh look at that I wonder if that's what
A	mm
C	we didn't know if it was

C	oh did she?
A	then she came back and lived up north somewhere for a while as a like chambermaid or
C	oh really?

A	yeah I bet
C	ah that's good
B	this is
C	not quite like the motorways is it?
A	no
C	better off going back up to the motorway
A	well I don't think you probably are cos you come a long way off the motorway
C	motorway yeah
A	er sometime obviously she came back to the pub
C	oh right oh god I can't imagine him working in a nightclub everyone was a bit younger then I suppose
A	well he weren't working in the nightclub
C	oh right he she just met him in the nightclub
A	yeah yeah
C	oh
C	even fair just picturing the that's nice isn't it? nice I bet those flats are expensive although you are looking at the motorway at the same time
A	I say nightclub it was more more of a disco
C	I just mean picturing them lot young basically
C	young Italian ah so she travelled a little bit then got the taste of something more
A	yeah
C	foreign
A	no
C	oh didn't she?
A	no
C	but they weren't but she was pregnant when she was married though wasn't she?
A	yeah but they didn't get married until she'd been out there about
C	yeah
A	so yeah they'd been out there about four four years
C	oh had she?
A	yeah
C	oh god
A	before she got pregnant and then had got married and had
C	ah so she was just living out there for that time?
A	yeah yeah
C	trying to learn the language
A	and she was a er erm
C	au pair?
A	yeah
C	that makes sense doesn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah that's a good thing to be
A	oh
C	quite oh no it wasn't Sardinia they lived in no I take that back they lived on the mainland but they took her on holiday to Sardinia that was it they were quite rich people they rent
A	oh
C	said they were really nice she loved it but she just doesn't earn very much money from it
A	yeah
C	but yeah makes sense that
A	and through one of the
C	yeah
A	it was through her I think that she got the job then in the embassy
C	oh she worked in the embassy?
A	er the erm
C	oh what did she do there then? I didn't know that she worked in an embassy
A	yeah like secretarial work
C	ah
A	yeah
C	ah that worked out then
B	day there
C	just cos she was an English speaker I suppose and it was
A	well she was bilingual by then anyway
C	oh she was? oh so she was learnt she learnt Spanish er Italian before she had any children?
A	yeah
C	ah so I always thought how difficult it must be to go through the whole having a child thing and still trying to learn the language
A	good lord I didn't think these these they never forecast this
C	this rain
A	might have some light showers they said
C	yeah today was meant to be alright wasn't it? what about tomorrow? I haven't even looked at the weather forecast

C	got a thing to do that have you? yeah I'm glad
A	yeah
B	couple of cars there
C	yeah so I don't think there's any way that
A	but doesn't it come apart?
C	apparently it can't like they've put it together in such a way that they don't think it would be taken apart certainly not very easily so it just basically sounds like no one wants to try taking it apart
A	oh
C	I don't know anyway it's fine but yeah them just getting the er
