A	what now you're drinking this wine?
B	what do you mean?
A	we'll
B	I we're sharing both of them
C	I enquired with my French friend
D	what?
C	well his house got struck by lightning
C	and he thought he woke up and thought that he'd been attacked by giant rats
D	what?
C	cos everything had like fallen off the wall
C	and he
D	he was like ah it's something
C	and he lives by like erm
C	so it's like
A	pond rats
A	definitely pond rats
C	and then he found out there's a lightning strike and all like the his electrical stuff had popped out of the wall like all the sockets
D	that's crazy wow
B	yeah my my aunt got electrocuted by being on the phone when her house got struck by lightning
C	did she actually get electrocuted?
B	got electrocuted
A	what she died?
C	what's happened to her?
B	no she's erm
A	oh
C	cos I watched this documentary once about people who get struck by lightning and it's always
D	that's weird
C	so yeah he'd like sleep for like three days and not three months but then like stay awake for like a week-and-a-half and the I can't remember like but they did like all the crazy shit like rewired peoples brains and stuff
A	I met someone who'd been and he was well crazy
B	and your chances like as soon as you get hit by it once that's what lightning knows you or something the chances like go down like one thousand percent or something
C	probably like
B	they will they're like they're like likely it happens once it's likely to happen again basically
D	yeah cos my friend's mum was like
B	what?
D	cos
A	charged yeah
C	yeah
A	well yeah this guy was fucked
C	you also get people that try and get hit by it as well
A	really? like
C	there's gotta be like
C	go out with like wearing like tin foil and holding like a big metal pole
B	all you've gotta do is go out
B	all you've gotta do is go out in a boat in the ocean and
C	say what?
B	if you go on a boat in the ocean and you go to the top of er the boat there's nowhere else for lightning to go to so you'd definitely get hit
C	yeah true
D	but doesn't it just really hurt?
A	yeah I bet it really hurts
B	yeah but you get superpowers
A	yeah you couldn't get
C	yeah you do get superpowers
C	I'd go through a little pain for a superpower
A	be more angled
D	er I got literally sort of once sort of
B	I
A	I got electrocuted
B	when when I was in
D	yeah
B	we was like we always like we'd get out of the pool soaking wet and getting electrocuted by the thing and we'd all like fall off the wall and
B	but everybody was still sort of wasted and no one never really noticed
C	we used to do that all the time when we were growing up like
C	where you like grab it and grab onto someone and then they get electrocuted
D	what?
C	pass it
C	yeah
C	no but it's like but it's not an actual electric shock like you can hold
B	yeah
C	it just like bolts you
B	yeah
C	it's really weird
B	I was always I was
B	so I used to have I once was in a house where you could see the
C	you can't see me
B	to see what would happen I thought
C	yeah we used to do that all the time but like you make like lines of people and then one person grabs it and passes it all the way through just gets
A	does the first person get it more?
C	no you don't get it cos it passes through you the only the end person gets it
A	that's
A	uhu
D	oh

A	yeah
C	and if like a guy gives you a blowjob like you get a Down Syndrome baby and like
B	why?
C	and I'd like in my dream I'd like figured out how you get all these like
C	it was really weird it was really really bizarre and I was speaking to someone about it and they've had a similar dream where they've figured they thought they'd figured out that shit so it's a common thing so
A	so who'd you have sex in the bum with?
C	I don't even know it was like no most of the time I didn't even do anything to get pregnant I just suddenly had loads of babies it was really odd and I had this dream for like about a week and I had to wake up panicking

C	I think I'm just pregnant
C	I think I'm pregnant
A	you should go to the doctor and say that
C	happy
C	I might do it
A	really
C	the worst ever I had like got really convinced that I had testicular cancer at school I just had to go to the doctor

C	people like stab people with needles and shit
A	yeah and I found this inexplicable pin prick on my body and I was like oh

C	yeah what happens do doctors go to the doctor?
A	I guess so it's like hairdressers you know?

A	he dad was like into it and then got her into it when she was like really young trained her up
D	ah
A	it's like you have to do that shit again oh that's so cool she
C	what
A	she could do all kinds of shit apparently acrobatics like pretty well
D	I thought she was cos she's like a dancer right? I thought she was a dancer?
A	no
D	that
A	she sort of does like a bit of modelling a bit of acting but not really she just works in
C	what happened to
A	yeah I think she should hook up with
C	just does
A	yeah she's got like quite a few acts she
A	yeah really
A	yeah
A	and it's quite slow like it sort of takes so long to load each one
C	come
A	yeah do it like
A	so what's going on at
C	nothing just
A	she does have a cat
C	nothing she's just
A	she's ill?
C	she's always ill man
A	oh
C	she's always ill
B	she's like you lot
A	yeah it was
D	yeah you should really stop drinking like you know I just I've been thinking about it and I don't drink
B	but that's did we tell you about the shop guy?
D	yeah
B	the shop guy
A	yeah he's like fucking scratch card junkie spends all his money over four hundred pounds a week on scratch cards it's like it's like
A	and then he said it again
B	I can't believe a scratch card addict told me to stop drinking
A	I don't drink myself
A	really? well I don't spend four hundred pounds a week on scratch cards
B	the funny thing about it was his story started off about saying how he won one hundred pounds once
A	yeah was like we bought a scratch card and he's like I won a hundred pounds once
A	and we were like cool then he's like yeah I actually had a really bad problem I spend four hundred pounds a week
A	erm
A	still he was chuffed by that
C	I wouldn't
A	I
C	I once accidentally spent fifty dollars on scratch cards
A	is that all?
C	cos I
C	and then I realised it didn't give change so it
A	did you win?
C	won five dollars
A	oh my god
A	that's
C	that's really depressing
A	yeah that's well bad
C	have you seen that film? what's that film? like American horror
A	really?
C	yeah
A	I didn't think anyone ever won that shit
C	it's really good
D	wow
C	he's like mate
A	oh my god
C	mate
A	wow
C	bought me a drink bought me a couple

B	might
D	Bollinger?

B	it just depends
C	nah one pound
B	can get a ten pound one
C	yeah ten pound
A	yeah but
D	I'm sure I've been behind people in queues in the shop and they spent like thirty quid on scratch cards just like that
C	yeah you can
C	I just always give them to people on birthdays cos like they're easy to get
C	wait do you give if you give someone a scratch card what terms and conditions do you like if
A	fifty pound
A	get back
C	I wonder what the law is with that? like if you give someone a scratch card but you bought it legally you would keep the winnings
A	I don't think the law applies you'd have to figure it out between you
A	fist fight
C	there's gotta be a law for that
B	arm wrestle for it
C	there needs to be a law for anything
A	yeah it's gotta be it's gotta be at least like strong moral code in place
C	yeah I reckon arm wrestle
A	but I think they're always like you have to state the as the conditions when you give them the scratch card
D	what did
A	nothing
C	happy Valentine's
D	that's that's
C	what's yours is mine
D	that's real oh yeah

A	he needs to
C	that's exactly what he'll need to do
A	well if you if you if you get like you the harder it does when he's drunk it's not necessarily like a social lubricant as that
A	it's more like anti-women spray
D	well he should just be slightly more
B	I told him how to get a wife
D	how do you get a wife
B	he's gotta go to America
D	why?
B	the British accent

A	there's a shortage of men cos they just think you're a
D	you're not you're not posh enough maybe
C	excuse me?
C	erm it's so not true like think how many English people in America now if you go to like Indianapolis or something but in like New York or LA it's like there's so many English people
B	that's why they're all there
C	what
C	it didn't work for me man
D	I think yeah well it didn't work for me either maybe we should just pretend to be like on Downton Abbey or something that's what that's what
C	that or
A	they even like Australia cos they have no standards
A	they're like anything'll do anything a bit sort of
C	they like white foreign people basically
A	Czechoslovakians
C	erm I did threaten someone though that was massive and he took it really seriously cos I did like a fake Cockney accent
D	no way? that's amazing
C	yeah it was
C	I was at this like show and we had like all access passes or whatever
C	and I got so fed up and I went and stood in like by this seat and this guy came up to me and said
C	he took his hat off

A	wow
D	and then like rested of my nose like went right pressed my nose like right up against the side of his head in his ear right

A	were you drunk?
C	in a stadium it was in the
A	I'm going to fucking kill you
A	anyone would take that seriously it's not your accent
C	then I turned around and walked up the stairs like fully expecting this like
B	especially if you're little and he's big
C	I was walking up the stairs shitting like bracing myself to like just cos he was like a massive jock like bracing myself for someone to just like come up and punch me round the head and I got to the top of the stairs and I was like
B	why was she screaming at a hot dog lady?
C	cos she was basically we were at this show and she just you know Americans just like take like rules so seriously and it was just like everyone was like no you can't and like we blatantly can do that I can't there was something about the hot dog she was like we can't serve it with just ketchup it comes with ketchup and mustard and she's like well you can and she's like no the management says that we can only serve it
A	I'm gonna fucking kill you
C	that like
C	that had drunk like he was just drunk and he was like slouched against the wall and they cordoned him off they put like
C	they put caution tape around him
D	that's amazing

C	like anything and like you give him a chance to talk about anything and it his whole thing is like it just
C	you know? it's just like
B	Kanye West is in art school
C	yeah he's just like
B	and er
C	art school was like a massive bunch of
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah it's
C	it was also like terrifying that so many people like he has so much power and influence over people
D	so I
D	I don't fully know who he is
A	he's like a rapper a famous
C	come on you can't know not know who Kanye West is
D	ah yeah I well like I have a like I have a feeling of like I know that and I know
A	yeah
D	but like he does he doesn't have any influence over me
A	mm
C	I wish I could be in your position he's so like present in my life
C	all the time
A	just right now or like
C	no forever
A	I wish I could be like
C	the amount of conversations I have to have on a daily basis about Kanye West it's ridiculous
C	it's all I talk about
A	I feel quite
D	yeah yeah I feel quite liberated actually I I feel quite free
C	how did you get to be in such a
D	I don't know
C	fuck
D	I
C	I really work
C	oh fuck
B	talk about his wife?
C	I didn't talk about his wife although I did walk into one walked into his dressing room at one point and he
C	but he he's like really
D	wow
C	then I walked out
D	yeah
C	stole an album from him
D	wait
C	I just
D	what do you even do? I don't I don't know what you do
C	I was his fluffer
C	get him ready
A	he's a nanny
C	and we were producing a photoshoot
D	but what do you do like what's your normal like what's your job title in the life?
C	like at the moment like production manager
D	okay right oh
C	so for like
D	so you make
C	I'm not very good at making it happen but yeah
D	that's your job?
C	yeah
D	okay cool
C	have to like find stupid shit people are like I wanna shoot in a castle that's got like da da da
D	yeah
C	and I
D	yeah
C	and ah
D	the people that were like loads of people have ideas you can always like people who actually do it are the people
C	well it's quite strange
D	yeah
C	you know I'm just like fine why don't I just
D	yeah
C	make my own idea happen?
D	yeah
C	it's really depressing but the reason I'm learning how to do it
D	yeah
C	not that there's any magic like this is like I know it sounds stupid but it's like I always was just like how does like this shit happen? like how do they do that? and it's just like you literally just you know and someone's like yeah I want a badger you literally like google badger farms and phone those people up
D	yeah of course
C	I know it sounds really obvious but I never like
B	can you imagine imagine having to do that stuff before the internet?
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	I always think that I'm just like how the fuck did that happen?
A	and people didn't do such
D	well also it's like trying to it's I mean you you you can you experience that if you try and do something in India cos like the internet doesn't really exist properly
C	yeah but also the I was speaking to someone about this today
D	yeah
C	it's like the way shit does happen is way more like common sense like I remember when I was doing shit in Morocco when we like wanted something there you'd just like go up to someone and ask them
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	or like in India it's like hey I want a palm tree so like I
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	and it's like I need a motorbike and they just go up to him and be like can I borrow your motorbike? here's it's like you have to call a fucking motorbike fixing agent and sign the fucking form and
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a weird like it's a weird sort of er like double like parallel thing where in one civilisation that's like really like it in some ways in the UK it's really easy to do like all sorts of stuff and in some ways it's really really difficult and
A	makes it more over-complicated
D	yeah whereas whereas
C	but we've turned it into the industry and you have to pull all those things in position
D	of course if someone can make money
C	so people have a job
D	at any point and and also pay tax than like at any level
A	and like regulations
D	yeah exactly it becomes really complicated
C	yeah
D	you
C	but it also it's just ridiculous because it's like people just cos they have the ability to ask for stuff just ask for things and that's what's really strange about my job is like you can't just be like do you actually want that? and like have you actually sat there? I was like
D	but why do they do that? just cos they're really rich and
C	cos they fucking can and they're getting paid in
D	yeah
C	another thing I really worked out which I always like walking around here being like how the fuck are these people drinking lattes all day? like what the fuck do they do? how are they buying like
D	yeah
C	like
D	also lattes cost er one percent over
C	yeah
D	so like there'll be lots of people
C	no but you know what I mean you go into like
D	no of course but there are lots of people like who who who can look as if they're really money but actually
C	yeah true
D	you know what I mean? and I think
C	yeah no it is
D	you know it's kind of it like there's a weird like they're
C	there aren't like at risk signifiers
D	indicators yeah
C	yeah
D	and and and the people who drink lattes are also drinking lattes with the people who are unemployed like they're work like they're in the same cafés you know and that's kind of weird
A	they should have they should have separate cafés for poor people cos
D	I really think they should have separate
D	I don't wanna be
C	I don't think they should let poor people drink lattes
A	the amount of
A	so I can
C	but yeah it is gross how much some of
C	and the makeup artist was getting paid ten-and-a-half grand
A	that's so crazy
C	to do makeup for one day
D	what?
C	and her assistant got paid two hundred pounds I'm like
A	was both
A	erm what and why do you think that is? because the make cos the makeup is like really good?
C	cos they have to install like the hierarchy
A	it was
C	honestly she it's just like
D	she did a what sorry?
A	it's incredible
A	it's cheaper than getting George Clooney in though
D	yeah that's true
B	what was that?
C	we have this like
C	ten-and-a-half grand it's cheaper than getting George
C	it's gross though man honestly like the money some people get paid
B	I know it's like I know this makeup designer who like has a crush on me I was trying to get him
C	oh fuck
D	what happened did you turn them down?
B	no I just wasn't that you know I was trying to get
D	oh yeah
B	I mean I probably could have done it if I'd emailed him more often couldn't really I didn't really wanna do it
A	why don't you do it this holiday?
B	I need to see him again
C	who
A	you basically need to go round his house and do
D	yeah it is a bit like
C	yeah pretty much
D	yeah it'll be a bit awkward if you have to like kind of do that other stuff to get the job that's a bit weird
C	and how do you get those
A	he wants to blow me off
D	yeah that's what I mean it's just like
C	honestly though most of the shit most of the shoots we do
D	but you don't wanna like woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo
D	ah sorry sorry I got I got the
A	that's absolutely no problem
D	I got the complete wrong end of the stick
C	but honestly like doing like fashion shoots like ads or whatever it is literally just like a massive hangout like no one really does anything you take like
D	it's so annoying
C	it's really really boring
A	people sitting around and then they have like a massive lunch
C	yeah they just have like
A	sit around
C	a big lunch and then like everyone that's working for them are just like they're paid friends cos actually the people that are like there they're like really sad and they've just like paid people to like hang around them that are their assistants
A	there are so many people wasting their time just sitting there all day
C	dude I'm wasting so much of my life right now
D	yeah but you get paid for it right?
C	yeah I get paid fuck all
D	it's better than doing nothing that's your job
C	and I can just figure out which bit I'm gonna do
D	you're probably getting paid more than minimum wage
C	dunno
D	how much is minimum wage now? six-and-a-half?
B	why don't you make up a story about Kanye West and sell it?
C	Kanye West is designing ISIS uniforms
A	ISIS
C	although that was
B	ISIS is real and therefore I'm making fashion attack
C	this this erm big idea that they
C	from nowhere he just came up to me and
C	I'm really good at speaking to people like that though I just fucking I love it
A	and you're like yeah yeah cool definitely you should do that
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	so good
A	that I guess I guess the that was a similar thing it was like
C	I
C	I think that's like my main skill cos I was like I need to get a skill I think I just have to accept that that is my skill
A	chat shit
C	just like I can chat I'm not very good at like talking to people about actual stuff that's real but if it's just like nonsense like I could go on for hours like that weird date I went on the other day I had like nothing to say to her and it was actually like a curse because cos I had nothing to say to her I could just chat about absolute crap
B	she probably thinks like
C	what's your favourite animal? and then just like went on about it for like hours
D	wait what?
B	wait wait wait wait
C	just like I don't even know what I just like animals that I
A	I don't even know
C	no no there wasn't like a bad
B	by Philip Pullman I think
A	huh?
D	yeah that's why I'm thinking like
C	oh no I was just talking about animals that I
D	oh I see right it's not like an actual specific thing it's just
A	but in like no in American Indian culture like your spirit animal is like the animal in the wild that you're most connected to
D	most connected to ah okay right yeah
C	yeah
A	and you can have like a
D	okay
A	where you go into the mountain and like
D	oh I see okay
A	have like isolation and like discover
D	ah see I felt like maybe
C	but also you're meant to kill them aren't you?
C	you're meant to like you kill your spirit when you kill an animal in like native America you like wear all its stuff cos then you like embody the powers of the animal which
A	calling upon the power of ten tigers
C	what?
A	er it's from a cartoon Captain Planet he calls upon the power of ten tigers
C	I call up the power of ten do you know one thing I'd love in life? would be an animal whistle if I could
D	yeah that'd be cool
A	or like a dragon
C	think about it
C	or like a bird
B	yeah they have like hawks falcons
C	yeah that used to be a big you can make crows do it you can make crows follow you ravens
A	it's quite easy to create train crows
C	cos they used to do it and like
B	but you've just got to never ever squeeze a full owl
C	what?
D	that's right
A	tell
C	what?
A	never squeeze a full owl tell
C	I like this is like storytelling like
B	show and tell
C	show and tell
D	I like it when we can tell a story
C	stories are great
D	so
D	and he was like kind of a bit of a bully
D	and the guy was like ah yes this is a perfect example of the of the dominant you know baby owl
A	baby baby chick like remains
A	that he's eaten just like an early like all over the floor
A	and the guy was like
A	and he was just like
D	never squeeze a full owl
D	and then the owl like started eating it again
D	amazing
A	what was that weird falcon dude that we met outside
B	I know I was just thinking about him
A	we were really
A	ah
B	he thought you'd asked him what are your plans
A	I was like do they eat plants? and he goes oh well I guess like I'm gonna do this for a while but it's always been my dream to like study like marine biology or something like
D	ah
B	but the weird thing was
A	I was like
B	the weird thing was obviously he kept touching his crotch
A	and he had an erection
C	shut up
A	yeah he was talking to us we were we were like he was a volunteer and he was really dorky and we were like sort of like wasters we were like really engaging and like chatting loads and being like really overly interested and like falcon like the whatever the fuck was going on and erm asking loads of questions and then he misheard when I asked if they like eating plants and thought that I was asking about his hopes and dreams
A	and then he we realised he had an erection
C	why did he have?
A	don't touch the
A	I don't know I think he was just
C	falcons are pretty sexy
D	wait but were there falcons like flying around or?
B	yeah there was one perched on the top of a table
D	oh well to be honest I'm not surprised
B	he was like having a look through my telescope like a peeping tom
D	oh
A	yeah
D	that's
B	peeping tom
A	we were like gotta go
C	that would be pretty cool that
A	good luck with your good luck with your plans
A	by the way do they eat plants or not?
A	well I thought I'd do this for a while and then maybe move back home er
D	oh
B	I saw like an eagle or a falcon like swoop on a pigeon in New York once
A	cool
B	and
D	what? that's crazy
C	I got attacked by a falcon twice in LA
D	shut up
C	I told you about it
D	what?
A	in LA?
C	like outside my house like you have to come down these little stair
C	a hundred percent
D	really looking forward to this story
C	there was a tree opposite my house so like my house is like a building you have to come down the stair like this and there's a door but like an outside door and I came out and I was like jogging to my car and I usually wore
B	the only time er he's get exercise
C	and something just
C	and I like something just fucking smacked me across the back of the head I turned around like really fucking hurt I turned around and a falcon was flying off and basically my head was bleeding and it swooped down and dug its claws into my head
A	it thought you were a rabbit
C	it thought I was a rabbit
A	ah
C	and then I was like I was fucking freaked out like fucking scared out of my life cos I was like I'm getting attacked by a fucking falcon
C	and I was like my like shitty car I drove to work and then like three days later it happened again and this time I was going into my house so every day
C	yeah it lived in a tree opposite my house and I was going into my house it swooped down and did it again and then it went to my door was there and it went like
A	bitch
C	so I had to throw a stone at it I was terrified
D	oh fucking hell
C	so then every other day
C	I just walked to my car with a bag and swing it round my head like this
C	to keep it away
A	you should have just pressed your face against its little fucking kill you
C	I'll fucking kill you
A	yeah
C	and throwing its
D	dude that's crazy
C	it was so scary man
D	but
C	and my head was like fully like it fully dug its talons into my head but I thought somewhere literally I thought someone had come up and just like punched me in the back of the head
A	motherfucker
D	but was it wild or did someone own it?
B	wild
D	a wild one?
C	I think it was wild yeah
A	sounds pretty wild
D	fuck man that's really that's a great story that's an excellent story
C	but then I had this like weird thing with like I thought it was like cos I was thinking of leaving
D	oh
C	and it felt like really spiritual
B	a spirit animal
C	I do like peregrine falcons a lot
D	I like peregrine falcons
C	I like an osprey as well
D	I like an osprey
C	I've been listening to this really good radio programme about ospreys
D	really?
C	yeah
D	nice
C	and he like puts radio transmitters on them and like tracks their migration patterns
D	yeah that's pretty cool man
C	they fucking go far man and then
D	yeah
C	this osprey like does different routes back from Africa
D	fuck
C	and then they the osprey his girlfriend cheated on him he didn't get back in time he took a different route and he didn't get back in time
D	no
C	and another man osprey moved into his nest
D	ah you're kidding?
C	and he got back
D	are they wait are they the ones that erm like pair up for life?
C	I don't know
B	that's like foxes
C	like ejaculated
B	barbed
A	and dogs right
D	and cats are barbed too
C	but they have to be in free-fall while they're having sex
D	what?
C	so they have to basically fly up really really high
A	that's amazing
C	start having sex and then they just free-fall so sometimes they don't get high enough or she's not good enough and he doesn't come they just fucking die and they just plummet into the floor
A	what if he's not good enough? then what happens?
D	she's not hot enough
C	yeah it's risky well like that's like the most extreme sex in the world you're plummeting towards earth and if you don't finish in time you just crash into earth cos you can't separate and they can't fly when they're together
D	they can't? dude that's
B	it's like trying to like pee through an ocean when you're treading water
C	there's a really good documentary about it just like animal sex
C	slug sex is like
D	oh no I don't like I don't like it
B	I thought slugs were asexual?
C	no slugs the way they slugs are like they have both sexual organs
