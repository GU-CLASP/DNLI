B	oh god don't
A	you know if someone's on the floor like this? they've got they've got the ball
B	mm
A	they're holding it there what you have to do is you have to put your two legs like that and there in there and then you put their hand on their body like you're staying there like that and then someone charged into me which you're not really supposed to do and like my neck got like ah
B	oh really

A	mum seriously don't be so serious
B	mm
A	mm
B	just the coaches will be fine just like just
A	mum
B	and then just go out of the game because
A	mum
B	what can be more serious is if there's something a little bit wrong and you haven't
A	yeah but you see mum things like this happen all the time
B	mm
A	like this isn't a one off like it wasn't something it wasn't something serious things like this
A	worse things have happened to people
B	mm
A	so
C	did your dad ever play?
C	no did did he ever play?
A	no
B	no his brothers did
A	but they wanted him to
C	but he didn't want to?
A	no
C	mm
A	mm
C	what was his sport? did he play any sport?
A	no
C	no
A	he did music
C	I'm I'm talking about school now you know? not not necessarily in erm
A	like he did like he just plays
C	cos at his age group you all had everybody had to do sport
A	oh yeah I guess so like
C	he had to do sport you weren't allowed to not do sport
A	he did like he did PE
C	mm
A	but like he didn't do any extracurricular activities as far as I know
C	no
A	we have to do that yeah
E	netball?
B	yeah netball I think I did loads of sports
C	mm
A	er
C	I mean you didn't have a choice
A	well yeah yeah
C	mm yes yeah
A	yeah and everyone has to do that it's not really
C	that's right and I just wondered which sport
A	well if I were to name them all I'd be here for a while
C	mm right
A	cos I'm in like
C	but you did did all the normal ones that's all we'll say
A	yeah
C	so so you might have done do you do you do rugby at school?
A	erm yeah but it's not rugby
C	not proper rugby
A	it's tag rugby which is horrible
C	mm
A	I don't like tag rugby at all
C	why?
A	it's erm a passing
C	mm mm
A	I will do tag rugby it's just I prefer tackling cos it takes out a lot of the strategy in rugby
C	right right
B	right
A	like it's very hard for a back cos you can't side step cos like if you side step someone which is like where you just weave out of them like it's really easy for them just to put their hand on you
C	mm
A	but it's quite hard for them to actually wrap around their
C	I saw you all cuddling at the end
A	what do you mean?
A	what do you mean?
B	when you were huddled
A	oh yeah yeah yeah okay
C	everybody was doing yeah yeah we did well

A	and the and they said it was their mistake that we won that we drew
C	right
B	it was their mistake it was whose mistake?
A	er
A	oh no
B	they said it was their own mistake?
A	no they're saying the whole team
B	oh serious
A	well it's true mum
B	was it?
A	yeah we weren't playing well at all they're just not good
B	mm
C	so how how is the
A	oh I don't know

C	because somebody near me again who supported you and the dad said it was it had been a good match
A	I don't know anyone there are good
B	yeah
C	that's what they said
B	somebody got like got bit need to separate
