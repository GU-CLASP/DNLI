unknown_female	like still frame
B	and was that one of the
A	ah
C	yeah I
B	I kind of recognise that as well
C	but I can't remember what from
A	yeah I recognise that quote
C	erm
B	yeah it it is so good cos like yeah er
B	erm cos I always think that
unknown_female	I'm not too keen on it
A	it's alright
B	I always think that like it's too in your face and like
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	it's vulgar for the sake of being vulgar
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	but he was saying how erm like the messages that were in like a few like recent episodes and like they'd tried to like tackle some stuff so like there was stuff about like
unknown_female	gun membership and then there was stuff about erm
unknown_female	Caitlyn Jenner and things like that and I was like oh maybe I would appreciate South Park more now that I know like the political and like erm social messages that it's trying to like put forward
C	yeah
unknown_female	but
A	end of the day though it is just vulgar for the sake being vulgar
B	it is very vulgar yeah
B	but there's there's other there's other shows that do like satire and you know like showing off erm everything wrong with like the current
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	like stuff like that that's that's better than South Park I prefer
unknown_female	yeah
C	er in terms of the sorts of jokes like that's
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	the reason why I can't really watch that much Family Guy I feel like the jokes are just so stressed a lot of the time
A	oh I like Family Guy
unknown_female	I
C	I I I do like it but when I've watched like a couple of episodes in a row I'm just like I can't deal with any more of this
B	yeah I prefer American Dad to Family Guy
C	yeah I do as well actually yeah
A	I don't
unknown_female	cos you
unknown_female	actually no it depends
B	Family Guy tend to go for this whole like ridiculous like time travel-y aspect thing I mean I guess if
unknown_female	like the amount of times that they like Stewie builds a machine and does such and such
C	yeah
B	mind you the amount of times that Stan also gets like erm
unknown_female	stuff from the CIA that can like do stuff but
A	oh yeah
B	my dad just asked me if I have any any of
A	who's
B	my brother
A	oh I should've guessed that
B	so I don't know if I have any T-shirts
unknown_female	I don't think I do
C	just I can honesty tell you I have no idea
B	I didn't wanna say yeah I haven't unpacked yet it's been more than two weeks since I've been here
A	you've not unpacked yet?
C	just say you haven't noticed anything so you're not lying
B	ah
C	what the fuck was that?
A	that was my text message thing
B	that was pretty cool
A	yeah
unknown_female	cos I'm Asian
unknown_female	it's like our national animal
C	yeah
unknown_female	it wouldn't surprise me if they did make it a national animal
A	it was a good goal he celebrates with a chest slide
C	I love how far they slide on this it's like
A	I know
unknown_female	whee
unknown_female	and sometimes you get like
A	yeah
B	I never I never got that when you play like football before when people would do celebrations where like they'll slide on their knees I'm like you're just unnecessarily tearing your knees up like why?
C	you're ruining the pitch as well
A	sometimes you can get like a dry pitch it's like
B	that's the reason why I never did it cos the first time I went to do that it wasn't particularly
unknown_female	and I went to do it and I
unknown_female	just
A	no we played once at
A	it was just the perfect knee slide conditions
unknown_female	and I was wearing waterproof trousers which made it even better
C	oh right
B	I did do it once on a ridiculously muddy pitch where like you know playing was impossible cos like you would just fall over
A	cos the ball gets stuck
C	I've done it before
B	but like when you're in goal as well like er cos you're just
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	running around the same area just the grass there's there's no grass it's just mud
A	yeah
B	and erm I dunno I
unknown_female	so I like kind of went like half on my arse and like half on my leg
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and kind of like slid like that
unknown_female	and then it were alright but I never
C	er it was really good on scout camp once though cos I er it was a big organised one with like loads of scouts from like all over the country they had this massive like
unknown_female	mudslide slipway thing like big like tarpaulin going down
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	with like
unknown_female	ah
unknown_female	all over it you'd go down that like get to a massive speed and then go another like twenty metres on the grass
unknown_female	at the bottom
unknown_female	all my pubes were green
B	that's quite rank
C	all the grass and like mud
B	I am tree man
unknown_female	so you
C	yeah like swimming shorts
B	oh right okay
unknown_female	I see
A	you guys ever
C	er well apart from that
B	maybe once I don't know
C	not shirtless but it was like it was like really soaked up wet grass so it wasn't too bad
A	oh right cos cos that burns
C	yeah I can imagine
A	I did it once and just hurt my chest
unknown_female	just basically just chest-planted
A	into
unknown_female	what the fuck happened there?
B	ah I I told
unknown_female	we've got
unknown_female	so it should be alright on that and then when he was on you know when you were saying oh what if you get to the end and it's got like not quite lined up?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	er everyone's got that problem so
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	you know?
C	but the you might have more of a problem with the front wheel steering is what I was thinking
A	what's this? robot?
C	cos it's cos the yeah cos people were saying it like
B	but like
C	yeah
B	er steering all goes like you can't
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	adjust it on the fly
C	yeah but that's what I mean though it's cos erm the previous students were saying about the fact it might be jumping from side to side with the steering it might be more out of line because of one of those recent jumps than other people's when they're doing the rear wheel steering
B	hold on sorry I'm messaging dad
unknown_female	er er two player purple
unknown_female	I'm literally wearing the shirt that he said he said er one any similar to a purple one but in a different colour
unknown_female	so
B	so so not purple
C	any colour but it's not purple
A	that's useful
unknown_female	I miss that I miss the old Mcmaccies theme tune
B	do they not use that any more?
A	no they use I'm lovin' it yeah but they don't use the
B	why not? cos that was like
A	that was brill
B	that was the addictive thing like when
C	well yeah that's what
B	when people would occasionally like just blurt out randomly
unknown_female	that's the addictive marketing that they go for
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	why do you then change it?
A	because Maccies are evil
unknown_female	and don't want people to be happy
C	well well it's kind of true really like if you're eating loads of fatty food
B	yeah I just remember the god-awful like healthy eating campaign
unknown_female	it's like if you want people to eat healthy just close just don't exist
C	yeah advertising all their salads and stuff
unknown_female	yeah
B	what's what's that noise?
C	it sounded like your phone
B	that was my phone but
C	oh that clicking? pipes
B	okay cos I can feel it on my back and I'm like I'm pretty sure I'm not doing this
C	yeah
unknown_female	the
B	the other what do you mean the other?
C	other shirt that's purple but not purple
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I have two identical ones cos one of them's
unknown_female	torn at the bottom but I still wear it oh it's this one
unknown_female	this one's torn at the bottom so like
unknown_female	the thing like just kind of like hangs out er
unknown_female	and er I got cos they're like two quid in Primark
A	bargain
C	that's fair enough
B	and then I have one that's er I got free with these jeans er from Jack Jones
unknown_female	that which is is purple with Jack Jones written on it and then I've got a purple one with yellow writing that says like Detroit and it's kind of like a bit sporty

B	yeah
C	like Greece?
B	I'm
B	it's definitely
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	cos there's just been on and off riots since
C	the machine industry collapsed didn't it?
B	yeah
B	it was the automotive industry
C	yeah yeah cos the it was the industry collapsed first wasn't it? then like was it
B	no
A	didn't hit Detroit
B	was it? oh right okay there there was some storm or something I think that hit Detroit and it just
C	a storm could've done yeah
A	yeah but it wasn't it wasn't Katrina
C	which one was Katrina?
A	New Orleans
C	oh right that's like south North America

C	yeah
B	south US of A
C	south south USA yeah
B	south U S of A yeah
A	the Deep South which is not south of South America
B	er I know
C	the Deep South is actually still north of the equator isn't it?
A	yeah ah I came off the post
B	to be fair that's like calling like
C	yeah it's like Yorkshire is southern to Scotsmen but
B	er
C	Yorkshire's to Scotland
A	but then we're all pretty southern compared to er Iceland
C	actually is Iceland actually that far north?
B	er
C	it's not much further north than us is it?
A	no
C	eh?
B	er Canada's probably the most north you can go
A	or Russia
C	because isn't isn't the UK it's sort of on level with southern Canada
B	UK's on like level with er like midline Canada I think
unknown_female	oh okay
unknown_female	the only reason why our temperatures are so different is
C	is the Gulf Stream yeah
B	yeah the Gulf Stream
C	we should be a lot colder than we are
A	the Gulf Stream does not exist
A	yeah
B	are you also a member of the flat earth society
A	sorry?

unknown_female	ah
A	how can you see the curvature of the earth?
C	well you can see there's a horizon
B	no but when you when you get like high enough and you look across like the ocean or any flat land you can see how the horizon curves
unknown_female	yeah
A	yes but it's flat land
C	ah that's a
B	so what is that then?
B	because I know there's something beyond that
A	is there?

B	yes probably
A	it's an illusion made by the government
B	alright hold on a minute
C	yeah

A	yeah
A	oh mate they're just the
C	yeah the world is actually flat and it's only like a few square kilometres
unknown_female	but
unknown_female	but everyone
B	but like what advantage? like can you imagine the amount of just to control someone
B	the entire world has to basically move and pack up
unknown_female	and like redeploy like different areas to fool one person into thinking that it's round
A	worth worth
C	it'd be hilarious
A	yeah definitely would do it if I was er
B	and then
A	maybe we're not real

C	yeah
B	society would not progress if everyone did that
C	that part would kind of suck but
unknown_female	but then again like in your dream world why does that matter to you? cos you can just make it a perfect society if you wanted to like
B	yeah you could do
C	it's kind of really selfish but it's kinda like
B	well would it not be kind of
B	so unless you could bring someone else into your dream
unknown_female	in which case you'd have to meet them in the real world
B	is this like how like nerdy and like social reject things like people talk about? they're like oh if only we didn't have to deal with the real world
unknown_female	er we could just make a perfect one
C	no the the
B	oh my god what was that?
E	surprise
unknown_female	ah
E	erm do you two have a ruler I can borrow please?
A	er it's in my bag
A	it's in the second pocket
C	er the way that it had occurred to me though is like er a future like virtual reality and like
A	humans
C	I'm going really sci-fi on this but like humans' evolution's like into the like digital like so we're all transcending the physical world and just
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah?
B	yeah
C	yeah that at that point like people would be against that but personally in my opinion like
unknown_female	if that's a better reality for you like fucking go for it mate
unknown_female	like the Matrix like red pill blue pill or whatever like that that touches on it doesn't it?
B	yeah mm
C	it's like if it's a decent society that you're living in in the Matrix why would you wanna leave it and go into this shitty one and change it?
C	well in the Matrix it's the real world so it's not that great but
A	because it well the thing is when you see the films like that everyone wants to see what the actual real world like looks like like
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	you know what? I'm happy
C	yeah fuck it I'm going back into the world
B	I guess Inception is the closest thing that does actually explore that cos it's like well
C	well well the Matrix does
B	well the no but the Matrix does but he like leaves it but in Inception arguably he accepts his dream like
C	yeah
B	reality and just takes that
C	yeah
B	but erm yeah no most of the films are just people are
C	yeah
B	so say the Matrix like plot basically happened to you
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	would you be like no I'm happy in this society I don't
C	I would I would probably go back in if I could but I I again the curiosity would make me want to see the outside world
B	I know I I'd be curious that's what I'm getting at people would be curious to know
B	yeah
B	I know I I get the logic of that but I'm just literally morbidly curious
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I'd be like well what's it like outside?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	can we make it better outside than here?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	like can we not live this like lie?
A	got another FIFA update
B	bloody hell this got well deep didn't it?
C	yeah
B	no
C	like cos humans are kind of shit in a way
unknown_female	they would make the world just the same as it was in there so you might as well just stay in there
B	well I I don't know I find it offensive that like this alien species would come in and well it's not even alien species it's just machines isn't it?
C	yeah
B	erm that like we'd be abused for like chemical power cos that's what
unknown_female	the machines use the humans to survive
C	it is it's symbiotic though cos they're providing a reasonable world for us at the same time so like
B	yeah I guess but I'd be like you bastards
unknown_female	like using us
B	you didn't have my permission I didn't sign up for this I was born into it
unknown_female	and at least
B	like I'm all for that but like there's gonna be people who are like no I don't wanna go back in
C	yeah
B	I'd understand why people would want to live there but I'd be like no you need to like kind of face the truth cos
C	yeah
B	this this isn't ideal
C	yeah
B	I mean it's ideal for you like personally but
A	wasn't that the plot of a Futurama episode with the er fake women?
C	fake women?
A	the robot women
C	oh right yeah
A	not quite the same but it's touching on the
B	oh yes I remember that
unknown_female	yeah and he gets a
A	Marilyn Monroe-bot
C	Lucy Lu robot
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	I'm sorry I didn't get the report done I was having sex with my Marilyn Monroe-bot
B	oh yeah then it like cuts and like obviously like the robot's like not aged at all and he's like
C	yeah he's just like an old man
B	he's like eighty odd he's like
A	can't remember
B	like throw him in a skip or something like really morbid and
unknown_female	probably
unknown_female	my owner has died I am free
unknown_female	and then
unknown_female	and then Terminator starts
B	I think that's how it works
C	Arnie used to be a sexbot
A	discuss
B	discuss
unknown_female	he does always like go back in time naked
C	yeah
B	yeah I know why don't the clothes travel?
C	if it's made of wool or something that's
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	somehow
C	well that's a good point yeah the metal parts shouldn't travel if clothing doesn't travel
B	I know
C	bullshit
B	I don't think Terminator is really used for
C	yeah it's not very accurate let's be honest
B	it's not really accurate and the fact that and hasn't the most recent one just completely like destroyed like all the previous?
C	oh I haven't seen Genisys
B	I haven't seen Genisys
A	I don't want to see Genisys
B	I've seen Salvation
unknown_female	ah
unknown_female	Salvation had erm
unknown_female	Christian Bale in it I didn't know that until like it it popped up
unknown_female	on like a like a little trailer thing at some point
unknown_female	erm I was like oh my god that's Christian Bale
unknown_female	why is he playing this awful role?
unknown_female	yeah
C	yeah I think it's only one and two that I've seen
A	one and two are the best
C	yeah
A	three was alright but mm
B	they've all blended together for me to be honest
C	yeah I can't remember I think it's just one and two that I've seen but I think I might've seen
A	yeah
B	well it's J
C	yeah
B	and then it's
A	his first name is
unknown_female	how do
A	we had a we had a primary school teacher called Mr Noon
B	Mr what?
A	Mr Noon
B	noon?
A	so every afternoon
A	good afternoon Mr Noon
B	afternoon Mr Noon
A	so yeah he got pissed off
B	the thing is like he must've had that like his entire life
C	yeah but having a bunch of like school kids
B	yeah if you if you had a naff name
C	worst
unknown_female	cos as primary school kids that was like the cutting edge like
B	of creativity
B	Matt Pickle
unknown_female	oh I
B	no
unknown_female	it's Mr
B	the the name means nothing to you guys he's the er he's erm he taught my dad when my dad was in school
C	ah right okay
B	cos my dad went to the same high school that I did
A	oh the PE teacher
B	er yeah and I couldn't remember his name for ages
A	oh yeah you were trying to remember this
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I just remembered it now
A	yay
B	Mr
B	er Freeport
A	Freeport
unknown_female	right cool
B	yeah the er
A	when you're
B	cos didn't I message you over summer with just like Freeport? and you were like
B	I know exactly what that is
A	just one word as well just Freeport
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	it was just like yes
B	yeah
unknown_female	right
unknown_female	and he taught my dad PE and he erm worked he he continued to work at the high school it was a middle school when my dad went I guess it was an all-boys middle school and then it became a high school for you know mixed
A	boys and girls?
B	boys and girls yeah erm but yeah he still taught PE and sessions with him were fun but like very
A	we had a
unknown_female	he was awesome yeah
C	yeah
A	he was the best
B	people from
A	huh?
B	people from
B	yes cool
C	approval from a southerner
B	yeah
A	I'm foreign
C	you're foreign
B	far south
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and like
unknown_female	sorry?
B	what's the closest cardinal direction to the Philippines?
A	east we always travel east
C	it's it's probably
A	oh no we always go east though to go there
C	oh
A	stop off in Dubai or the Middle East somewhere
B	yeah we stopped off in Dubai when we went to Australia landed at like three o'clock in the morning and it was like
C	oh god yeah
B	it was like
C	oh yeah we had that when we went to Cyprus
B	and then we got delayed by seven hours the flight
unknown_female	like the connection in Dubai
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	was delayed by seven hours
unknown_female	that's
unknown_female	so I spent seven hours in Dubai airport and people were sleeping cos it were it were nighttime it was three o'clock in the morning
C	yeah
B	er people were sleeping like they were lying down on the benches and
A	yeah pisses me off when they do that
B	and some were underneath the bench
unknown_female	and then like the bags like
B	yeah I know it was
B	cos there were just no we couldn't find seats anywhere
unknown_female	oh right
unknown_female	erm
C	I've done that in quite a few European stations actually just laid my bag down like big sixty-five litre rucksack and just sleep on it
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	how often do you take a sixty-five litre rucksack to train stations?
C	that was when we were going round Europe
B	oh was it?
C	yeah
A	just sleep
C	you know I I like being being prepared and having like massive rucksack like that
B	I didn't have a rucksack but just having a clip-on you know that
C	oh yeah
C	oh it's some of those smaller rucksacks are absolutely shit though
B	yeah I know but the chest one was good so as soon as I stopped just as before I got to our street
C	yeah
B	erm I er I put the bags down cos I was like ah
unknown_female	I clipped that on there I was like oh I don't have to like
C	sudden release
B	cos you have to if you don't have it on you have to kind of like bend your shoulders like that to stop it slipping
C	yeah to stop it slipping
B	slipping off and I did that and I was like oh this is alright now
unknown_female	I can get into this
C	yeah it sort of transfers it across your chest doesn't it?
B	how far is it from Sainsbury's to here?
B	do you reckon it's half a mile?
C	maybe
B	it's more than half a mile
A	I'd go for more than half a mile
C	I can never judge distance going through like urban areas cos it always feels so much shorter than it is
A	nod
C	I imagine it's that Sainsbury's
A	that Sainsbury's though
A	no it's
B	it's eighteen minutes away
unknown_female	yeah
C	oh yeah the Google Maps always like massively overestimates the time it takes to get
B	oh it is point nine of a mile
A	yay I was right
B	so I I walked a mile with like twenty kilos of shopping on my back
C	so many
unknown_female	I know
B	if you drive there it's over a mile and if you transport I don't know what transport means but yeah
A	if you transport there
B	but would public transport not just be the
unknown_female	yeah
B	yeah no but it still has to it still has to go the route though doesn't it? is what I'm saying
C	no I think the route's the same route you take the car I think
B	yeah I know that's what I'm saying like it's it's a one-way system
C	yeah and then you don't you have to get off at the bus station and walk but it's not very far
B	I was really tempted to get the bus back
unknown_female	cos I saw the two A there
C	well if you've got a bus pass you might as well
B	yeah I know I was like er I was like I I there I will get there and it'll be like oh bus leaving in like ten minutes I'll be like ah I can walk it in fifteen
B	I probably it probably took you a lot longer than fifteen to walk back
B	it probably took me about twenty minutes to walk back
unknown_female	yeah I got to the
unknown_female	and it literally just fit in like the two bags that I had at the side as well
unknown_female	like I put all the bottles and like
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	liquids and that in in the rucksack er and then the two shopping bags literally just got filled up and I ran out of like
unknown_female	ran out of items I was like oh I judged this perfectly
B	I was gonna get some erm some Coco Pops were on offer and I was gonna get them and I kind of like looked at the thing before I'd even paid
unknown_female	and was like I don't think I'm gonna be able to carry it
C	just carry it in your teeth on the way back
B	cos I had to erm I had to get er bog roll for upstairs bathroom
unknown_female	oh yeah
unknown_female	cos I keep using their bathroom cos theirs is nicer than ours
unknown_female	that I've used like a lot of their bog roll so er
unknown_female	I'd I'd bought them bog bog roll
A	it's always a problem for us
C	just as a thank you for
B	yeah cos ours is grim
unknown_female	and
C	they do a very bad job if they do
B	er yeah I cos I I think as far as I know I think
unknown_female	so it's definitely on balance so I was kind of when I came back this time I was like er and when there were no one there as well I was like yeah I'll go upstairs and use theirs
C	well if use theirs you can't if
B	I don't use it any more
unknown_female	although I
C	to be fair you you'd still be better off with that if they took their turns doing it
B	yeah I know I'm I'm happy just buying toilet roll and bleach
A	we bleach
B	a toilet brush holder
C	yeah I was gonna say don't do get em off bleach
A	we bleach
C	yeah
unknown_female	when's our next house cleanup again?
unknown_female	er it's
A	I forgot which job was yours
C	is it is it end of the month or start of the month?
A	start of the month
C	alright so it will be weekend after next I think
C	I don't actually know what day it is today
B	we need to put some supplies for er
A	Friday
B	well maybe not this year cos our house is er oh I didn't I told
A	what did he do?
B	so he came round and was like ah he basically he pulled me from my room and made me follow him and his son around
A	oh this is with the thing in the?
B	looking for the leak and then he was like do you have a number for the university? I'm like okay like thinking he
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	erm but he found a number for it I was alright cool and I went to go upstairs and he was like no no you need to stay down here and tell them that I've fixed and I'm like well I don't know if you've fixed it yet like
unknown_female	we just know it hasn't come through yet
unknown_female	but there's the thing and he like kind of rang up and there's all these names that I recognised which I shouldn't recognise because you know
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	there shouldn't be as many problems but there is erm and he's like speaking he's like yeah yeah I've got a lad here and the woman were on the phone she was like so is it up to like do you think er like your housemates or sorry can't remember how she phrased it but like do
C	er
B	yeah but I didn't think that I should be the person to say oh yeah it's fixed like I haven't been in
A	yeah
C	well that's fair enough you can't say it's fixed if er
A	if it's not
B	I just said it doesn't appear to be
B	I bet he is
C	well yeah he's he's
B	the fact that erm I was gonna go in erm with
unknown_female	pay to go onto campus again and then come back
unknown_female	and then I think maybe do it a third time it wasn't beneficial to do it
C	for the banter
A	for the bant
B	well just cos the gaps between lectures mean that
unknown_female	oh right yeah
unknown_female	if I stay on campus it's a bit too
C	yeah it's like two or two or three hour gaps
B	I'm gonna run out of stuff to do or you know have to go home or whatever
A	I always stay on campus I'm just I I go and sit in
A	yeah can't get rid of me
B	what time does
A	eleven
B	eleven? okay
B	er friends in engineering
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	they were chatting about doing it and they said that er like
A	does it?
B	well apparently yeah
B	well I
C	oh right so they shut early
B	cos er they shut early but erm
unknown_female	erm so they'd start like over there in
A	it's a shit bar
A	I haven't been to
A	I haven't been in
unknown_female	yeah
B	I haven't been in I haven't been in
unknown_female	I got the bus back and I was like oh my god I can like I am quite drunk
unknown_female	like a pint
A	well
unknown_female	and then like I got on the bus and I remember like my vision going like
unknown_female	not going like completely I wasn't like smashed
C	just falling off the
B	but I
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I was just kind of shocked and like a little bit scared that I felt so drunk after like one drink I was like
C	yeah
B	I know I was er I was like pretty sure no one spiked my drink
unknown_female	yeah
C	like if it was on tap it's likely a very strong cider
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	so
B	it was it was on offer there er they were like they were having
unknown_female	as in like not a brand name like obviously some sort of like
C	yeah
B	specialty thing
A	home brew
A	yeah
B	so I had that and I was like mm but yeah that that's the only time I've been in
A	ah no I'm not having that
B	erm well
unknown_female	erm
C	okay
B	er like as in we'll only have like lectures two days a week
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and we'll have like three days off or whatever so they were saying erm do like campus bar crawl like then
B	but they were just kind of like discussing it and
B	I was I was gonna say something about
B	can you get
A	erm
B	probably not
A	probably not
C	I'm trying to think
A	well how long do you need?
C	yeah
B	well yeah cos they were saying that erm apparently
C	and then
A	yeah but it's open it's open
C	yeah it's it's open like all day now isn't it? or like every day
A	yeah cos
C	like they they complained about it or something so they've they've rectified it
A	and
C	yeah
C	it's sort of like a horrible half mix between club and bar and it's just doesn't work
B	yeah it is the one that I'm thinking of then yeah
A	it's not great I don't like it it's like a social space like a social club if you get what I mean
unknown_female	the ones you get attached to a church
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	but they try and go for a club element to it which is horrible
A	it is horrible especially when the er DJ's putting Spotify on
C	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
B	like what the fuck?
A	that was that was so weird when we went in that night and just like yeah
unknown_female	like all clubby and like what the fuck?
B	yeah cos it was it was like a Friday or a Saturday night and it was just dead
A	it was a Thursday
B	oh was a Thursday?
A	yeah
B	cos I can't remember I was trying to work out like what days they'd make it a pub and what days
A	it was a Thursday it was a Thursday when we went I remember it specifically cos I was so weirded out it was a Thursday and they were doing this
B	they were having like a club night thing and it it's normally a pub but it works better as a pub
A	it works definitely much better as a pub
C	yeah
A	it's pretty decent as a pub but as a club it's just what the fuck is this?
B	yeah cos there's a top floor as well er ain't there?
A	yeah
C	and it was
B	it's normally closed off because er hardly anyone there er to fill the bottom floor
B	what did it used to be?
B	oh it was
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	you remember
B	oh really?
unknown_female	oh right
B	so you can you'll pre-drink taxi to town or bus to town depending on how much money you've got
unknown_female	you can't get a bus back though cos it
A	for reasons obvious to everyone
B	erm
unknown_female	erm and then you'll go to er somewhere
B	someone got stabbed out er er outside it er
A	is
C	that's the thing like I reckon
B	I've heard about
B	er he was like you what?
B	yeah something like that maybe just before then erm so someone else had been I say someone else I'm pretty sure someone got stabbed back like before I came to uni as well but yeah someone got stabbed outside
A	not great
A	well yeah well people go to
unknown_female	don't they?
A	it is terrible I can't believe
B	oh really?
C	what?
B	it'll be because of erm if it's pre-patriots well don't
A	probably not
A	kits
B	kits yeah
A	it's not the uni it's the kits it's the the guys that sorted that out
B	oh right okay
A	I fucking hate
unknown_female	they're absolutely like they're they're unreachable and they just do fuck all
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and they just collapsed their JCR
C	I must admit last year's
A	yeah yeah
C	like they were getting way too into it and like aggressive and like
A	yeah no they are they're just useless
B	I don't really remember that just cos I think everyone was kind of aggressive but
C	no
A	were they?
A	and that one massive girl with the netball do you remember her? the one with
B	I dunno I I only went to see
A	she was just shouting at everyone
unknown_female	like
B	you're all shit
A	something like that
unknown_female	but yeah no it was just
C	well it'll be a new lot this year won't it? but
A	they're terrible
unknown_female	they are terrible they're absolutely horrendous they miss
unknown_female	they've missed social events group which you should go to every week or at least one of you should
A	yeah
C	like should they not have been kicked off at that point like full stop?
A	no apparently not
C	I feel like they probably should've done
A	yeah er one of them's already quit
C	oh really?
B	oh wow
A	and one of them's already thinking about quitting again the VP welfare has quit
C	oh my god
unknown_female	did they not look at what the job entailed before they er?
A	to be fair though er you don't get a
C	oh I suppose yeah you found it's harder than you thought it was
A	yeah but I'm still gonna carry on with it
C	yeah
A	I'm not a dickhead
C	yeah
A	I'm not
B	yeah since more people in engineering have found out that I'm in er
C	yeah
B	and they're all from like
unknown_female	so they they were just kind of surprised cos you know none really hears of it but then we actually do like a load of really cool stuff so I think they're kind of
A	jelly
B	obviously proves that we're quite good we're just kind of small
A	we are I think that's
B	yeah it probably does
C	yeah cos you've got to er appeal to less people
A	yeah which is always a good thing
C	no
B	erm so you know on Facebook you can make like nicknames for people and that?
C	yeah
B	so on our erm our robot's in that
A	robots
B	I dunno why I said robots
A	robots
B	robots
A	the robots
B	our robot's in that group so
C	you need to make it a
unknown_female	robots
B	erm we er changed like a load of nicknames to stuff
unknown_female	erm so
A	someone's gotta be called dickhead in that group
B	well basically
C	I'm really hoping
B	no that's er that's
C	oh right
C	actually changed
B	no no
C	right oh right okay
unknown_female	I I like it
A	I love this the fact that I just made all of my substitutions and then one of them had to get injured
unknown_female	erm
unknown_female	actually a drawing of a penis not just the word penis
B	it is er no
unknown_female	er
B	erm
B	maybe
unknown_female	I dunno

unknown_female	he's gotta be scouse
unknown_female	if he's not scouse it just does not make sense
unknown_female	so yeah erm and
unknown_female	he was like submitted I said did you put it in first year? and er the
unknown_female	er he was
C	wait has he actually seriously put it in the wrong box?
B	no no he didn't
C	I I knew he was joking
unknown_female	but like the the reaction that
unknown_female	he was like
C	and then he put that and literally at er yeah
C	yeah
B	he put bastard and I wrote cunt
unknown_female	just instantly and then
unknown_female	so I thought that was kind of cool
unknown_female	just we both had
unknown_female	calling people mild like it's not even a swear is it? just to call him plum
B	no but like you're calling him a name aren't you?
unknown_female	yeah
A	oh you plum
B	you plum
B	is it? when when's a plum used as a flattering term?
C	well I I never hear it used full stop I think I've heard it used more
B	I'll be a plum
C	no like
A	be a plum
B	they'll say like be a dear
