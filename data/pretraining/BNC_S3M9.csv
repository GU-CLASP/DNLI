E	uhu
A	but then they did all the talks and it's like just like random separate bit that cos no one really knew no one really went there
E	oh
A	so I don't
A	were quite quiet
D	oh
A	there was one girl who showed up for her talk and she was like so stoic like arrived and there was loads of people there and then she realised it was cos it was raining and it was like
A	sheltered you know
A	everyone everyone was like
E	oh no

B	later
A	yeah right
E	oh wow
A	with like full of local news teams and stuff but I didn't have any
A	have a cookie
A	have a cookie
E	that's awful
A	erm yeah we it took quite a few
A	all the press are so funny cos it obviously everything gets so jumbled jumbled
D	yeah
A	but like they had
E	shit
A	uhu it was just around the corner
E	okay
A	our place didn't have a pool it was like
E	was it haunted?
A	apparently it's haunted
E	amazing
A	some hippy chick told me it was haunted in town she was obviously just like er hoping
E	like hippies are always think shit's haunted man
A	yeah she was just being like really like matter-of-fact about like yeah there's a ghost there and I was just thinking
A	but it's so old and really quiet and like
B	yeah they need to
A	yeah it has this crazy history
E	shit
A	it's very like
E	sounds scary
A	filled with also
A	just like really really old furniture and it's like very
E	yeah
E	atmospheric and erm but cos it cos it's not really a hotel and there's no like staff there and stuff
B	uhu
A	like they come in for a bit during the day and like make the beds up
A	I was
E	oh
A	I was so frightened I saw this woman again I was like man
A	what are you playing at? telling me that stuff and I've nearly lost my shit
E	oh man
A	but that pool was round the corner from this hotel and er it she just said we could go and use it
E	that's cool
A	which was nice cos there was just no one there you know
B	but we er but were that place the weirdest thing is it's owned by a tequila company and they just have have parties there
E	that's
A	and they only have tequila
E	what?
A	and we were were at first we were like we couldn't figure out what it was we were like
A	none of the people spoke Spanish and we like yeah we were saying our stuff and then we spoke English
A	no it's just tequila like only tequila
D	were people just drinking all day?
A	no one was really there except us
B	there was like a
A	on the same day
B	tequila tasting that we went to once
A	yeah we had a tasting
A	there wasn't more than that
B	tequila is two hundred and fifty dollars a bottle
E	wow
A	yeah the weather was
A	really lovely it rained a little bit but it was kind of nice
E	yeah
A	what else did we do?
B	erm
A	talking about it it's actually pretty funny
D	YouTube
B	remember what?
A	yeah
B	can remember what?
A	what questions were asked?
B	all that kind of and like
B	and
A	that's a bit
B	bullshit I've known you for ten years and I've never seen you eat an apple
E	that's really good
A	it's like what we should have said is dishonestly?
B	or
A	apples
A	but yeah basically
A	cos we were like
D	I want an apple
A	I would like to see you like hungry
A	drive up to a roadside
A	or hot tacos?
A	yeah
D	did you eat loads of tacos?
A	uhu
D	really?
A	it was like two places
D	yeah
A	and they're they're not always open
D	so what what about this restaurant?
A	his restaurant I I actually think is like not very good it's quite fancy like
D	it does look looks a bit fancy
A	I think it's for tourists
D	yeah
A	he has a really good reputation
D	yeah
A	but it's it's quite it's a
D	is it
A	it's a little bit er a little bit like with a Mexican twist
D	right
A	you know?
E	yeah yeah
D	yeah yeah
B	but actually I think that the food that he or they made on that on like the chef's dinner was it was much better
D	yeah
B	that stuff was good
A	oh yeah yeah that was nice he did like a Mexican dinner
D	oh
A	but I guess there's yeah
D	so it's was just like
A	it's just there's a certain way
D	loads of people acting
A	there's a certain way to make money
D	but you know it's different though cos that's what everyone likes to eat
A	also in that kind of spot maybe that's
D	everyone liked
A	you know the
D	likes to eat normal food but sells
D	expensive food it's a bit funny
A	I think that's the thing maybe it's just like my take this was there was like it was like super like
D	no
A	mm
D	great
A	really like beautifully carefully made but it wasn't like just like street food and I think I just like one or the other it was it was a bit like showy like
D	yeah
A	sort of semi-fancy but just like expensive normal stuff
E	yeah
B	it was like that
A	but he does really well you know?
E	that's cool
A	they're opening up this they're it's like a ranch
E	a ranch?
A	they've bought the land and they're fixing it up so it should be ready like some time next year his girlfriend was like I was like what are you gonna have on the ranch? she's like I dunno like horses porks
A	cos she was Mexican so
E	that's so fucking sick
A	so
E	that's a fucking sick answer that's my type of answer
A	horses porks
B	mm
B	horses porks chickens you know
E	you know
A	yeah
A	mm
E	okay
A	it's in San Miguel but it's like out of
E	right
A	just outside the town you know?
E	so they'll still be there like the restaurant thing and they'll just be living on a fucking awesome ranch with horses and pork?
A	I think they'll just go there sometimes and I
E	okay
A	I I I think they're gonna do like food there and stuff like
E	right
A	and we can go and stay
E	mm
A	so it's a big exciting project but it also really felt like perhaps San Miguel is about to change quite a lot
E	yeah
A	cos er right now it's like it's kind of amazing that it's such a secret cos it's just not really like super-easy to get to and stuff
E	okay
A	but it's like very well-kept like mm mm and very beautiful like there's good food there it's like there's certain kind of tourism which has been going for a long time but it feels like that might change and just be a bit just like
E	yeah
A	new developments and a lot of new
E	yeah
B	yeah it's gonna become
A	suddenly just bring in
B	like
A	gonna get
B	the the
A	lots and lots of new restaurants lots of people from America who have restaurants there
B	yeah
A	opening stuff
E	mm
A	cos there's also like a lot of really rich people are there just like
E	mm
A	investing in in there you get a lot and I think like the tourist industry will change too so I don't know
D	it's like
A	when it's gonna be
D	yeah
A	like it is now
E	so we should go like next week
D	yeah
E	basically
D	yes we should move yeah
E	I think so
B	two weeks before the flight yeah and spent five hundred and ten pounds
A	that's for the
E	that's pretty good
B	for return
D	well good
B	yeah and we go in
A	and like
B	like
E	cool
B	and we go to America
E	yeah
B	right?
A	yeah
E	can you stop in
D	yeah cos it's a great coast it's
E	I didn't know that

E	see that's the other thing is if if the house has got enough room it makes sense
D	well the thing is like we should look at it I mean
D	there's plenty of people that wanna stay you know it's pretty good you know that's the thing it's hard to say that cos we're still waiting on this thing to happen cos this thing's meant to happen on Monday and we're also flying on Monday so it's kinda like
A	mm
D	if it happens cool we're
B	what so
D	that's er the twenty-ninth and that's in like a week or so
B	erm I I found out today
D	cool so all
B	my mum her house is actually

A	yeah but is this for when
D	yeah yeah
A	anywhere a nice one it's definitely like
D	yeah
A	it's worth it for me
D	I mean it's quite a good price but obviously
A	yeah
D	from the demand like we'd probably make more er but
E	yeah I think so
B	yeah yeah I can imagine that I imagine everybody wants to stay like right on this like block basically
D	yeah yeah the we're mainly getting loads of requests from families with like parents and three kids
A	unfortunately that's against our policy
A	not possible
E	unless they don't speak English Spanish then they can go on there
