B	I hope so
A	Cos you'll do the work won't you

A	for speeding
B	uh-huh
A	and that means you're banned
B	huh
A	and you have to take your test again
B	oh no

B	mhm
A	yeah it was both times was on the M54

A	rather the
B	uh-huh

B	nightmare
A	yeah
B	tut

B	so has he done?
A	you've gotta be careful of that
B	uh-huh
A	you'll have to take it again
B	really careful
A	yeah
B	it's difficult sometimes though isn't it
A	very
B	to see where the to just I mean were there was it signposted? The speed limit?
A	oh no doubt
B	mhm
A	yeah oh sorry
B	mhm
A	then all of a sudden it changes it to thirty miles an hour
B	mm
A	because there's an old people's home
B	oh right
A	on er the right
B	oh dear
A	and I didn't believe it actually until they sent me the photo
B	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	A day's training
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	now the day's training er you it's only available in Lancashire and er and um
B	isn't it
B	uh-huh
A	Staffordshire and Lancashire were is the piloted scheme
B	uh-huh
A	they're the only apparently the only counties that do this scheme
A	so it's comme ci comme ça
B	uh-huh
A	er anyway the guys who did the course who like they they'd drive and what they'd do their function in life is training fast response drivers for the fire service the
B	uh-huh
A	the police and rapid response at airports and all that
B	ah
A	they're really good
B	uh-huh
A	and it was brilliant
A	and er we we were top of the class
B	oo
A	thought it was so chuffed like
A	and then you do a hundred per cent absolute
A	we were  We were  reformed reformed
B	er so what do they teach you on this course?
A	well it's just really good because they take you round
B	mhm
A	or
B	uh-huh
A	so and like you're
B	mhm
A	and a little kid run out
B	yeah
A	imagine if you hit one?
B	yeah
A	you know
B	I quite like driving quite slowly at the moment
A	oh you will
B	driving up to forty when it's when you can but
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	you know
B	really?
A	I had three tests when I was er yeah three three tests
B	uh-huh
A	and it was er in them days it wasn't so hard
B	uh-huh
A	and er
B	what did you have to do back then then?
A	well there was no theory test
B	no?
A	there was no checking the oil and water and stuff
B	oo God
A	you have to open the bonnet don't you I think
B	I think so
A	part of the test now isn't it? Also er the gear changing was different because er nowadays it's you're taught cos I've taught I ended up teaching both my daughters to get them I both got both my daughters through the test
B	yeah?
A	because they were doing they both were doing hopeless with the instructors
B	mm
A	so then it was down to dad
B	mhm
A	but
B	uh-huh
A	you I don't know whether you've been taught that?
B	yeah
A	but that's allowed now
B	oh
A	yeah er yeah yeah
B	and what was the reasoning behind that?
B	oh okay
B	mhm
A	the cars have moved on haven't they?
B	mm
A	since my Morris Minor
B	I've got a friend who wants to she's got a Morris Minor in her back garden
A	mm
B	she wants to do it up and
A	it's no road tax on it
B	no
A	no no well yeah if it's over twenty-five years old yeah
B	uh
A	but they they're not very environmentally friendly
B	oh right
A	but how badly is the condition of it?
B	I'm not sure actually
A	yeah
B	really?
A	mm
B	what like as a collector's item?
A	er no no
B	or as a drivable?
A	I'm I'm old
A	it was an old car
A	in old black and white films
B	oh really?
A	well it was  it was  twenty-five years old when I had it so
A	my
B	A fiver?
A	yeah
B	blimey
A	A fiver
A	yeah
B	well that's the thing
A	now they're cheap to buy

A	very cheap to buy
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	she's er craftily watching Eastenders upstairs isn't she
B	she is
A	and um so therefore it's er it's six pound fifty a gallon
B	mhm
A	to the gallon
B	mm
B	yeah
A	I mean er really I mean you gotta think you gotta do I really
B	yeah
A	you know the buses and the trains are great aren't they
B	yeah
A	the buses are a bit rough aren't they

A	the
B	and people who don't know how to act with other people
A	the nutter  The nutter  on the bus
B	yeah
A	comes and sits next to you

B	er for the er
A	the winner
B	oh were there different heats?
A	which so it was over several nights
B	oh okay
A	so they're getting a bit of mileage out of the
B	yeah
A	two thousand quid
B	Cos I was thinking that's not a cheap way of doing it
A	yeah er yeah
B	two thousand quid a night?
A	I think there was er there was probably about three or four appearances I think they end up to win  to win  it
B	mm
A	to to to get
B	was it? I guess
A	yeah
B	all the people participating get their families along

A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	cool
A	yeah
B	I bet you miss
A	yeah well yeah
B	mm
A	and it's quite sad
B	C'est la vie
A	C'est la vie as they say in France
A	what's the saying they say? Es la vida?
B	que sera sera
A	that's that's Italian
B	whatever will be will be
A	is it  is it  er
B	que sera
A	oh no
B	uh-huh
A	but I thought that was an Italian when er
B	maybe it is the same
A	que sera
B	yeah
A	I think
B	no when I learnt Spanish I was able to understand Italian
A	the the Spanish one is perhaps ain't it quizás quizás quizás
B	quizás quizás quizás
B	ah
A	if I remember rightly
B	oh look how international we are
B	multilingual
A	but er have can you speak Italian? Can you speak any Italian? Or
A	have you spoke to? Cos if they can understand
B	yeah
A	if you speak I can understand most of what they say
B	when I was in India and I was hanging out with some Italian guys
A	mm
B	and they spoke to me in Italian and I spoke to them in Spanish
A	oh
B	and um we understood each other perfectly
A	well
A	my er a friend of mine well I haven't  I haven't
B	uh-huh
A	very fluent Spanish speaker
B	mhm
A	one of them now spends six months in Spain or and both
B	mhm
A	so both one of them'S done Italian one's done er Spanish
B	mhm
A	italian company
A	I'll speak you know er it's not too
B	oh no
B	then again the technical words tend to be quite similar to the English
A	yeah
B	really?
A	they stood  they stood  for it
B	she she couldn't pull it off
A	er she er they just accepted her you know
A	Cos er none of them could speak English anyway
B	well I was teaching English to this guy in Spain who said I've got this conference
A	huh
B	of the regional government
A	oh yeah? Yeah
B	and he said oh I've got this um conference
A	yeah
B	swap best practice
A	senegalese probably
B	from
A	mm
B	would you be up for coming for these two
A	as a go-between
B	two days and just be the person who
A	mm
B	anyone has any language problems? I said yeah no problem  no problem  Okay I get there nine o'clock on the first day
A	uh-huh
B	er interpreting booth
A	oh a proper one? Oh no
B	A proper one with the headphones
A	and you have to be
B	mouthpiece
A	you have to be quick don't you
B	oh my life
A	mm
B	I er the way he kind of told me about it it was just to be there in case anyone had any problems with vocabulary understanding
A	er yeah yeah
B	thought it would be the odd translation and the odd whispering into someone's ear
A	so you got so English is coming through and you've gotta do French and?
B	no
A	oh so oh God
B	which you
A	native
B	oh do you know what I did though? Er cos I mean when you're in the booth you have to have about five different thought processes going on at the
A	mm
B	listening attending to the Spanish and then your French
A	yeah yeah
B	at the same time you have to be listening ahead
A	that's er
B	then got completely behind
A	pretending pretending that there was a problem with the
B	yeah
A	the
B	but I was so embarrassed
A	that's really
B	it needs training
A	yeah
B	I mean there's
A	yeah
B	you
A	no that's er that's a real hard call isn't it that is
B	yeah
A	because I think if you're
A	er you
B	hm
A	that's the that's when you know you're getting somewhere
B	which I can do fine when it's no pressure
A	er so well you cos you see you probably have to go through in your head to Spanish to English then to French
B	yeah yeah
B	no I can do straight from Spanish to French
A	can you go across? Yeah
B	Cos they're quite similar
A	yeah
B	I can translate between them
A	them Senegalese though they can they tend to speak a lot of
B	mm
A	and they've got a couple of tribal languages
B	mhm
A	senegalese
B	mm
A	as well
B	I think people who grow up in a country that has got a lot of languages within that country they're more open to
A	mm
B	learning languages and picking it up
A	in England it's really bad isn't it
A	really bad
B	but I guess everyone around the world speaks English so they don't feel
A	no
B	that they need to learn
A	but it's just courteous isn't it
A	to teach to learn
B	mm
A	and we've got um I I would've thought there was enough people now to teach
B	well I think the problem is that you know they're trying to teach classes of thirty kids at a time
A	mm
B	so you're not actually teaching how to communicate in the language
A	mm
B	they don't see an objective
A	they're not motivated are they
B	exactly
A	mm
B	and they er they have no mm they take no joy in it
A	mm
B	enjoy the whole
A	I did
B	what from travelling around?
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	that's that's how I've learnt it
B	where have you studied at a night school?
A	in in
B	in the Brasshouse?
B	ah
A	up there
B	cool
A	but I found that  that I found that  like frustrating cos I think most of the people who go there go for social reasons rather than actually to learn to speak the language
B	really?
A	and I think also they teach you er er they teach you more on
B	yeah
A	not bothered about
B	yeah
A	how to write it and that
B	with CDs?
A	cDs and er I've got a I I I dunno what it is I've got all sorts of stuff for the
A	I think the the more CDs you buy
A	it doesn't work like that though
B	it's like the keep fit videos that I buy
A	yeah
B	I've got so many keep fit DVDs
A	er no no yeah
B	do I ever do them?
A	no
B	no
A	one of the best things I've found is on the net
B	mm
A	I think on the net you know go into YouTube
B	mm
A	that's pretty good
B	yeah
A	really good that is
B	yeah
A	but
B	definitely
A	speaking the language
B	get yourself a French girlfriend
