A	so what did you think of the equality vote?
B	erm I thought I don't really know the results
A	I think it's erm going to be a yes
B	oh erm I hope it's going to be yes cos all all my friends and stuff say it's yes say yes
A	do they?
B	yes
A	didn't you say that some people in your school wanted a no?
B	well yeah but they they seem like the unmature ones and they haven't really they're not very smart
A	do you think they're a bit homophobic?
B	I don't know just don't think they're clever enough to to know that just cos you're gay doesn't mean you're not an actual person it just means you're gay
A	were they? what were they against? people being gay or people having kids if they were gay?
B	people people being gay they just said just cos it's wrong they have no real valid point they just it's just eh their take on it erm I hope that when they get older they have a different view on it
A	yeah how many boys do you think are are like that?
B	out of my whole year?
A	mm hm
B	thirty
A	really? who are against it?
B	there's about fifty that are not against it
A	so thirty were against it that's quite a lot
B	mm hm
A	what would you have voted for?
B	I would have voted yes if I could have
A	yeah?
B	cos I think gays should have the same right to marry as anyone else
A	yeah
B	cos marrying can be a really good thing for someone
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and why would that be different than them just being boyfriend or girlfriend or?
B	erm I think because boyfriend or girlfriend is kind of easier to just break up I think with marry you really are sure that you're never going to break up and you really you just love each other that much that you'd want to spend the rest of your life with them
A	it's something to do with commitment then?
B	yeah
A	would you get married?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	yeah
A	yeah where would you get married?
B	I don't know a beach?
A	when do you think's a good age do you think to be married?
B	I don't know
A	forty thirty?
B	yeah
A	and you have do you ever want to have kids?
B	sorry?
A	want to have kids?
B	probably cos well a lot of what I've heard from a lot of people is
A	yeah that's pretty cool isn't it?
B	yeah
A	well you're a pretty favourite part of my life
B	maybe
B	erm I think
A	do you think they might need
B	I think stability would be a very a very big factor in it I think it'd be hard to marry if you didn't but I don't think iId let anything stopping marriage
A	I've
B	yeah
A	they're not
B	yeah but I don't think that should stop you from having kids cos if like
A	you've got to be able to afford to have them
B	yeah that's true
A	they need somewhere to live and enough food
B	yeah as long as you've got
A	yeah but do you
B	yeah but obviously so you can pay for them and house them
A	yeah
B	but
A	cos you've got to
B	yeah I know
A	it's not very fair
B	I know
A	how many
B	two that would be good preferably a girl and a boy
A	yeah what would you? what would you teach the boy and the girl do you think?
B	to be
A	would you have any rules?
B	yeah
A	what kind of rules would you have?
B	obviously like bedtime and stuff that you can't be going to bed at one o' clock in the morning and stuff
A	what other kinds of rules?
B	well feel like there's millions of rules but I don't think I could go through all of them
A	what about? what would you do if they were being mean to other people at school?
B	erm if they were being mean to someone else at school
A	how would you punish them?
B	I'd punish them for two days by
A	what if they just said rubbish and didn't ignored you
B	erm if they did that then
A	no
A	or does it feel like yesterday?
B	I am a child
A	yeah but like oh okay when you were like younger toddler and things does that feel like long long time ago?
B	yeah that feels a long time ago
A	can you remember much about it?
B	no
A	no?
B	no
A	no?
B	no
A	erm do you remember your room with a big leaf on top of your bed?

B	erm
A	cos if it's just the cinema that's okay or if you have a bit to eat or something?
B	I'm pretty
A	yeah I'm sure you could do some of that so just just keep me up to date
B	yeah but that that that would be unsupervised
A	well I'm sure some of it could be unsupervised I'm just not happy about you wandering around beforehand and afterwards like unsupervised
B	so so are you okay with this? are you? are you okay with this?
A	mm hm
B	I I go into
A	yeah but what I'd probably do is say hang around the shopping centre while you're having something to eat before you go into the cinema so that I'm around there
A	I'm not necessarily sat down with you the whole time but just
B	so you're saying you'll walk around in the shopping centre?

B	June six
A	I know but like times
B	oh okay
A	that kind of thing have you had any more thoughts about what you
B	no
A	no?
B	no everything I thought would
A	you're having a sleepover anyway somebody else's
A	you're having a sleepover anyway
B	it's just
A	it's just what?
B	nothing
A	if it's like one of your mates saying can I have a birthday over here? sleepover over here? and he has his birthday over here it's just not really very polite
B	no
B	it doesn't
A	you're you've been at
B	okay so I can?
A	you can have a sleepover at somebody's house
B	okay so not two?
A	hm?
B	so not two sleepovers during the summer?
A	well why don't people come around here?
B	because
A	why is it bad?
B	because it's just can't be as loud cos
A	I see but
B	yeah
A	so maybe if if everybody pays for their own
B	yeah I'd like to go paintballing
A	not paintballing
A	it's a hard life isn't it?
B	no
A	think about it must do something okay?
B	can't really think of anything I'd like to do
A	aw I don't know what about?
B	I can think of tons of things that I'd love to do but can't do
A	could always have another cinema
B	yeah
A	for your birthday a second time meeting up
B	yeah
A	erm well you could
B	mm
A	that's like suitable cos I think they've a roller-skating thing as well
B	I don't like roller-skating I'd like to either go go-karting laser tag or
A	don't they have a laser tag at
A	that might be something different if you're going to the cinema one time and if you're having a sleepover another time maybe be cool if you want to go laser tagging another time
B	okay I'll go laser tag
B	I don't know how much laser tag is
A	mm
B	don't
A	could ask them?
B	did ask they won't come
A	they might like laser tag
B	I bet you ten euro
A	well what about
B	erm I bet three euro
A	aw there's no harm trying though is there? maybe your mum would be up for it hm?
B	no
A	I've played it before
B	yeah but
A	would I would I cramp your style?
B	mm
A	you just go round going
B	it would it
B	that would really be embarrassing
B	yes yes
A	how so?
B	yes
A	I wouldn't be embarrassed if you came to my birthday
B	yeah that's because it's it's like you having your birthday with all like vintage things and me going oh yes oh yes vintage shoes something like that it doesn't work we and then all my friends would make fun of me
B	they would beat me up if that happened
A	no they wouldn't because they'd be so scared of me
B	no
A	they'd be like oh my god got to keep on the good side of that one because like she's going to come down on us like a ton of bricks
B	you won't beat anyone
B	I know that's cos you hate guns you hate killing you hate everything to do with guns and killing and laser tag is guns and killing but without paintballs
A	well to be fair I don't think anybody dies
B	no nobody dies in paintballing either
A	yeah but maybe we better check on that
B	paintball is just
A	actual killing is
B	yeah it's war
B	paintballing is probably the the best one to do cos that's the most cool thing
A	then there's then there's war would you like to go to war?
B	no I'm not stupid you get nothing out of war
A	dumb as bricks?
B	bricks aren't smart
A	any of them them your friends?
B	no
A	so what like some of the people in your class? do they really get on your nerves?
B	yeah
A	who really gets on your nerves?
B	one guy
A	well that's not very nice did you tell him his mum beat him?
B	stop
B	it's like no
A	is it embarrassing? am I embarrassing you? where's the fun of being a parent if you can't embarrass your kid? spend so long bringing you up and giving you all this stuff and it's all quite hard work so you might as well get a bit of enjoyment out of it
B	you
A	no that was different that was actually kind of putting me down I mean I'm teasing you by saying I'm going to beat your friends to stick up for you it's different
B	yeah but how do you know I won't get the same feeling you did?
A	I'm not doing the same as you did
B	yeah I didn't even mean it I didn't even know what I was doing so you might not
A	but putting on my voice and complaining that I was erm funny with you about the computer and just being really kind of
B	and you might not mean to be mean and like cos I might get the same feeling when all my friends are making fun of me it's not a good feeling maybe it's a good feeling for you maybe
B	it's not making fun of me it's just my friends are making fun of me cos of that
A	but I'm telling you I'm not saying it in front of you and your friends that's different I'm telling you here
B	it's just my friends that would be a thing that my mum
B	make fun of me
B	okay okay

B	I'd go up to my room and just play on my laptop well first I'd help help you up
A	put your head in your hands and cry?
B	no
A	I see
B	I'd be a bit annoyed
A	would you? why?
B	cos if my friends were there then they would make fun of me I'd feel quite sad that would make me sad
A	so you'd
A	you're a real person?
