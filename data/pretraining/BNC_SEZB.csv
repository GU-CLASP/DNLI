A	ah
B	yeah but I was in the taxi erm and I went to erm just go check my phone and it wasn't in my bag so I asked the taxi driver erm after he dropped me off to erm look under all of the seats and I had a look under the seats and I couldn't find anything and we opened up the boot and pushed the seats back and there was definitely nothing in there so erm then I messaged my mum who is
B	alright okay I had to ring the police as well I did get a log number for it and I did that on Saturday morning
B	yeah
A	oh right do you reckon they're gonna pay out then?
B	I hope so
A	I mean like even though the
B	yeah they can restore it to factory settings erm
A	right
B	so
A	that'll be blocked then they can't use it even if they restore it to factory settings they can get on to it but they can't use it as a phone they can use it as a fancy Ipod
B	mm
A	that's it there's
B	yeah
A	so
B	I don't know why either
A	I've found five of them last year and I gave them all back because it's just pointless
B	yeah
A	even if it weren't pointless I wouldn't keep it because you don't know what's on there
B	yeah
A	you don't know if someone just died or
B	if somebody took your phone you'd be like
A	I'd be devastated
B	you'd be devastated so why wouldn't you
A	it's happened to me before
B	why wouldn't you just send it back to the person?
A	just have like
B	yeah
A	and I can't get them back and that are the most devastating part
B	yeah like it's not really about the phone it's about the photos
A	it's not even the phone
B	yeah
A	so
B	you should learn to back it up all the time
A	I back mine up once a month
B	yeah
A	on the first of every month I back mine up and wipe my phone except for my messages I wipe all the pictures videos everything after I've loaded them onto my computer because otherwise my phone was slow
B	mm
