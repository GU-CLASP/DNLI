A	so anyway erm
B	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	one is knowing what you want to achieve and why
A	mm
B	so you have a perfectly good
A	no
B	but we wrote a version of what a business plan then I thought was now I look back on it it was pretty good
A	mm
B	because we really tested the waters on everything and made sure if things could have that
A	yeah
B	and what we did that was
A	mm
B	that enough local people would want to use that it could actually we can actually say that it would be used
A	yeah
B	and they would produce enough income to make it run because what was there before was
A	no
B	they set it up
A	and it didn't
B	and it didn't
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	we gave
A	mm
B	and that showed and we have three or four under some of them some of them
A	no
B	but then we were always one step forward saying we want to have a look at it
A	yeah
B	and we could then check out that each of those
A	yeah
B	and could actually pay us the kind of rent it needed to keep the building running
A	well yeah
B	so that was a really really good
A	yeah
B	and checking that that could be added together to make a sustainable business plan
A	yeah
B	which as it turned out we had
A	yeah
B	and so I think that that is the absolutely crucial first step we could've said our aim was to get enough money to keep the building going
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I know
B	we structured it so that we could do it on one and a half
A	yeah
B	or one and three quarters cos we did end up with a
A	yeah
B	but we had a half time admin a full time manager and eventually some box office but the box office was actually paid for by our tenants
A	mm
B	primarily because they were the ones who needed people to
A	yeah
B	so we actually minimised the things we
A	mm
B	erm and you know that that audit was the first thing that
A	mm
B	checking that the space was really needed and wanted
A	mm
B	and that people who were needing and wanting it I remember I was talking about the fact that we would have to check that each one of those was viable
A	yeah
B	I know
A	it was
B	erm and they had put together their plan properly and we could see it was but the cinema wasn't
A	oh is that what happened? I never worked out what happened to the cinema
B	what happened to the cinema was
A	oh it's just very flammable
B	and it was highly flammable so you had to all kind of protect that stuff when we could've spent our entire budget on turning that main room the conference room
A	yeah that actually
B	no it wouldn't we we
A	no
B	couldn't have done it it would've cost too much
A	mm
B	to do it structurally
A	mm
B	and the insurance would've been
A	yeah
B	as well and it was a silly thing to do you have to prove your case when you've got to
A	no
B	and it was when
A	mm
B	a
A	mm
B	it's got nothing to do with anything
A	no
B	but you will that is a card that people use if they want to make you flinch
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right
B	and so I said to the church hall committee
B	because they keep saying they're gonna pay their rent but they never do so we leave them in cos we keep hoping we'll get it
A	oh
B	and of course it meant that they would never get it
A	yeah
B	so no you can't go there erm
A	aha
B	I don't of course they never did get it
A	yeah
B	what happened was the after school club spent their grant on all kinds of maths stuff
A	yeah
B	and not on paying the rent cos they're still in
A	yeah
B	mm
B	mm
A	that's so prohibited
B	mm
A	that you just carry on and that's what we did with
B	completely
A	you just get to the point where you think
B	well one of the lessons if I was gonna look at it I wasn't involved in the board at that point but do you remember in the early days
A	mm
B	fifty-three percent maybe
A	mm
B	if we were sixty-three percent let we would
A	yeah
B	we never wanted to be a hundred
A	mm
B	and then we said we would
A	yeah
B	if we'd have forty percent coming in from one tenant it would've made a lot of difference but
A	yeah
B	of the building
A	yeah
B	and that that broke a rule we started with
A	I know it's actually in it's actually not
B	mm
A	so erm
B	and that I don't know where it came from but it was
A	and that was too many eggs in one basket
B	it was
A	and we lost it yeah
B	mm
A	and actually it was
B	I wonder what happened
A	oh hang on a second
B	yeah
A	erm by the full proof base and then
B	mm
B	mm
A	erm
B	so those were all that we had at the beginning
A	yeah
B	if we'd stuck to them we could've made
A	yeah
B	the years much more comfortable
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	yes
B	it
A	yeah
B	had he
A	he started
B	I heard that before
A	so erm
B	we set we set some interesting principles there that we should've
A	mm
B	no
A	what happened that they wouldn't
B	I haven't managed to persuade them because
A	mm
B	they don't actually do
A	actually it was true that I
B	no but
A	like an old
B	it's the second statement of the year
A	mm
B	but to start considering them
A	mm
B	goes by the board when you get a hundred pressure situations
A	yeah
B	it's easy to panic and go with something the other thing I find the churches do is they've got a very enthusiastic
A	mm
B	and is sure he can do it as well
A	mm
B	I use he
A	right
B	but he leads them
A	mm
B	or actually I know one moment he's done it too
A	no
B	like we had a list of people that we
A	mm
B	and by the time the building had been done
A	I know about that
B	erm that there was no tenant for because
A	yeah
B	there's no one else that's kind
A	yeah
B	it's a bit like at the
A	oh no
B	do you remember?
A	yeah
B	and we went into the business plan to
A	mm
B	so asking people to come with their business plan and their references from their bank
A	mm
B	was important
A	I think what we've done this time as well
B	mm
A	they will do it up they will design it for themselves but they're erm
B	mm
B	mm
A	so actually they they can come in you know some
B	of trash yeah
A	of trash you've ever seen in your whole life
B	but they never use that bar anyway
A	and then they would never yeah
B	never
A	they gonna strip out
B	but do you remember we we install the bar in the crypt?
A	oh yes of course yes of course
B	and as soon as we got tenants
A	yeah
B	it then ended up in the other end of the crypt for a while and then it moved upstairs for a while and it was trash
A	yeah
B	and it cost that much cos the walls didn't fit it
A	yeah
B	it had to go down the bar
A	yeah
B	but there was no need for us to do that
A	no
B	cos once we got the restaurant in they wanted to design their own kitchen and
A	yeah
B	and everything else
A	yeah
B	erm so no fitting out is not what you need to do
A	no
B	cos they'll put their own colour paint on the wall
A	yeah and even the school
B	mm
A	and painted this and once they painted it white it looked utterly different
B	mm
A	that's all it all it needed was to remove the wall back
B	yeah
A	but erm so that you know that had to be sort of seriously stripped out but erm stripping out is the least of it really
B	yeah yeah
A	and in erm
B	and part of it
A	carry on paying the rent
B	because she
A	no
B	and things like that
A	mm
B	or
A	right
B	but that
A	he's very interested in our
B	he's
A	figures
B	good what he he understands and certainly
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I do think that you look back and you realise from the beginning
A	yeah
B	and we could tell when the bigger bills were gonna come in in the whole lot
A	yeah
B	so we always knew where we were
A	we filled in our books on that basis to this day actually
B	and it's it would
A	what your annual accounts look is er is one thing but if you've got three months in the middle you have no money and you have loads of creditors then you're gonna go down
B	yeah you are you are
A	mm
B	some of them you will always find someone in the attending who's worked in business enough to know why you're saying it
A	mm
B	but a lot of people
A	no
B	it's a a wing and a prayer for them
A	and to this day we don't have an overdraft
B	right good you don't need one
A	no I know but you know
B	it's a pain if you have one cos then it starts yeah
A	yeah well that's just er yeah that's because they er
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and it should
A	yeah
B	the one thing I think we didn't do we probably never got in front enough
A	that's good that is good
B	erm what you need is to put into the bank enough money to hold you over when there are voids
A	yeah
B	because in a building that's
A	mm
B	that's what I mean by it's er it's a single unit in one sense although it's broken up
A	yeah
B	you're still gonna have to pay the heating bill whether the people are in or not
A	yeah
B	er whether the big space is filled or not
A	no
B	all the little people still need their heat
A	yeah
B	so you still need to have money in the bank to cover the average length of the void
A	yeah
B	which could be six months or something
A	oh it can easily be six months by the time you
B	mm
A	I mean and we erm we did the maths recently and worked out that
B	mm
A	yeah and that's without anybody actually being in any other part of the building apart from the church space
B	mm
A	because you would still need to insure the whole thing
B	mm
A	and although erm
B	the fact is it's er
A	contribution towards the insurance? though it's not true actually the whole building you know the whole building is insured as a whole
B	mm
A	not er space by space by space likewise electricity bill likewise
B	mm
A	then you add up
B	yeah
A	five thousand here twenty thousand for insurance whatever
B	yeah oh absolutely
A	get up to thirty-six without blinking
B	completely
A	and so when erm
B	yeah
A	to stand still
B	mm
A	mm
B	before we got into detail on designing the building
A	yeah
B	we made it manageable first
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	stuff on the different levels how the
A	yeah
B	which was actually a foyer
A	yeah
B	had to be cut off from the staircase
A	yeah
B	otherwise they were simply a throughway
A	yeah
B	but each space had to be individually
A	yeah
B	and so getting all that manageability right then we could say to the architect we need to redo the building to
A	mm
B	to make this work
A	yeah
B	erm but that's the right way round
A	yeah
B	and he and er the architect and the quantity surveyor gave us
A	yeah
B	and we didn't get any detailed design done until we got the work we got the money done
A	yeah
B	so we figured well okay that's the minimum we will now go and look for where we could find that kind of money
A	yeah
B	erm and there was potential for that
A	and then
B	ninety-eight percent
B	I haven't had any response
A	yeah
B	from
A	mm
B	he's never answered because I think the way the diocese operates is
A	I wouldn't be surprised
B	somebody in the diocese told him this would be a good architect this would be a good
A	yeah
B	and he's never they've never looked at other people
A	no
B	and I think that
A	yeah
B	who knows a huge amount about quite a lot
A	yeah
B	but he's in his comfort zone actually even though he
A	oh yes
B	it became clear I filled in a form and sent it through to him that he needed to find out what the local authority was doing with the community right to bill cos they had to endorse
A	mm
B	his bid
A	mm
B	and he can't act as someone in the council and basically they said to him oh no no no for goodness sake don't get us involved in that it's a nightmare
A	mm
B	so he
A	yeah
B	that has to be taken up locally and the council does need to be involved with it
A	yeah absolutely
B	but erm
A	yeah
B	like a nice community centre here
A	they've
B	all
B	all round the houses they pay a huge amount of money to be architects over
A	but when
B	you know he was like but we must be able to get money from the big lottery they do community fund raising I said yes they do
A	no
B	but us
A	yeah
B	so he said well we we could work within that and that could be part of our Sunday I said the big lottery doesn't work like that it has to be it
A	no yeah
B	it has to be the biggest funder so that they can control how you do it
A	yeah
B	they they don't play ball with what you want they'll never be a part or minor funder
A	well that's another four four funders isn't it? er er
B	yeah and they're there but then
A	how could they
B	erm
A	yeah
B	that you can't back track and say let's start the design again
A	no
B	he theoretically has said to me
A	no
B	he might not
A	yeah
B	and one
A	yeah
B	so it's it's it's working with the council
A	yeah
B	exactly like
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but actually what's dangerous what's worrying about it is the building is so much smaller I doubt that you can have more than one thing happening in there at a time one or two things happening in there at at a time and that means that those things have got to
B	well that means essentially
A	yeah
B	on the plan
A	no
B	erm
A	in which case immediate drop
B	yeah or and he said well it might be healthy eating and I said is there a market inside doors that has a
A	no
B	no that's not where we were with the
A	yeah
B	and then the design will only valid in the context that but he's already started asking that
A	mm
B	which is
A	yeah
B	is the community audit which is entirely missing from there which is
A	yeah
B	that giving the right business
A	yeah
B	to the business plan
A	what happened
B	it won't
A	cos
B	mm
A	it could be peaceful and and you know on the day they're opening people will flock towards it and they'd take it to their hearts
B	just occasionally that happened
A	yeah
B	but only by luck chance you found the right local budget but I'm not convinced they found the right local budget you know?
A	no
B	a lot of the projects they want in there
A	yeah
B	but they need to go and see the projects that's why I said to them well how are you gonna run these things how are we gonna know? we'll have organisation
A	that's sensible
B	well who are they?
A	yeah
B	where's their letter saying they want this space
A	yeah
B	and telling you how many people they're gonna have and where and how
A	yeah and how much they're gonna pay or how much they can afford to pay you actually that
B	yeah or if
A	yeah
B	will only be used at peak times do you just need to move your
A	yeah
B	and again it's the kind of things which
A	yeah
B	cos he doesn't know how to think of it and that kind of develops the details
A	yeah
B	but you have to
A	I know you have to I mean
A	yeah
B	gave me years ago that I still use
A	mm
B	three times a week
A	mm
B	and what is the maximum attendance?
A	mm
A	yeah
B	well
A	mm
B	they were allowed only because they had so many doors to be outside there wasn't really much internal space really three hundred
A	yeah
B	you need to do space to be able to work mostly for twenty-five with
A	yeah
B	the occasional squash
A	yeah
B	so churches then say oh we have four hundred people sometimes
A	yeah cos yeah
B	and alright
A	oh
B	cos you
A	oh right
B	so all the army service is oriented so everyone turns up
A	no
A	mm
B	and you know the churches on that same basis would say to me we've got to have a kitchen we've got to be able to cook here
A	oh
B	and then it turns out when you er that eighty thousand pounds was supposed to have servery for about fifteen thousand
A	yeah
B	servery being a sink and dishwasher cutlery and that kind of stuff
A	yeah
A	and a fridge
B	and a fridge yeah fridge dishwasher sink
A	mm
B	well do you want to pay eighty-five thousand pounds for a kitchen that gets used once a year? or do you order fish and chips service?
A	yeah
B	or do you do something well we don't like carrying food in well eighty-five thousand is a lot of money
A	yeah
B	you could buy caterers a lot of times over
A	yeah
B	with that money
B	yeah exactly so I tend to
A	well yeah sorry yeah
B	push hard to get the money use
A	yeah
B	to construct a servery but once they've got it
A	yeah
B	erm there is one church I've been working with that erm
A	yup
B	er serving lunch every day
A	mm
B	every weekday
A	mm
B	er at you know community rate and so I know they
A	mm
B	oh but it's our mission
A	yeah
B	supply
A	yeah
B	in other words er do you really need another homeless project? I know you'd like it and you want to be doing something
A	yeah
B	for people who are really poor but are there any really poor who are gonna turn up?
A	yeah
B	are you going to install this kitchen and finally you get one or two people once a week?
A	ah
B	and along with another person who I can't
A	you haven't said enough to me who know
B	they could be anywhere in England that's
A	or even out of England
B	they could be out of England couldn't they?
A	mm
B	being built at the moment
A	yeah
B	who are not interested in turning up to
A	no
B	and they've not talked about how they're gonna get the money for the food and the ingredients and who's gonna be the manager and do the shopping and all that it's all pie in the sky
A	mm
B	and they expect
A	yeah
B	have a servery
A	yeah
B	so
A	and actually they're
B	well that's
A	because actually doing that with volunteers
B	you can't do it
A	you can't do it
B	in charge of the safety of the volunteers you need an expert in
A	yeah
B	controlling homeless people
A	yeah
B	so again it's a kind of thing that
A	yeah
B	how are you gonna serve your market? how is it manageable?
A	yeah
B	is it really there? and I don't think there was one for them I never saw
A	no
B	a single
A	yeah
B	well that was an issue
A	yeah
B	I'm sure if you are there all the time you see some
A	but then you've got to be careful as well because I mean round you know It's
B	mm
A	and they weren't allowing them to take drugs and they weren't encouraging them to take drugs but they weren't actually
B	they turned a blind eye
A	them to take some drugs and they both went to jail and I say and people go ho ho ho
B	mm
A	fortunately the
B	yeah
A	but you know but er you know
B	yeah
A	or they're taking drugs out in the open and then falling coma
B	and being
A	yeah
B	with their hepatitis and their AIDS and all the other things they're carrying in their blood and
A	yeah
B	then the old ladies come to church and don't understand why it matters
A	yeah
B	yeah it's it's all of that stuff that people need to understand
A	and also how they're going to pay for example I mean this is a thing that what we have to we have to talk over and over again haven't we?
B	what do you think about
A	mm
B	those people are probably spending five pounds a day on alcohol and five pounds a day on cigarettes
A	mm
B	and let alone the drugs
A	mm
B	so when they come to do an activity in your building
A	yeah
B	per person
A	yeah
B	and so multiple that by your twenty-five people
A	yeah
B	and they still have a mindset of you've got to do things really cheap or give them away if you're a church
A	yeah yeah
B	and that's not true
A	no
B	you've got to be able to make the hard decisions
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah well if I could if I had quick
B	mm
A	and then I had this man who came and see me who who argued that I couldn't really be a charity because we were all all earning our own money
B	no
A	church
B	you're not trading if you're letting space
A	no and then and then other people come to me and say well you know
B	do you remember who was setting up the structure for
A	yeah
B	that would make the hard decisions like if someone's not paying the rent we throw them out
A	yeah
B	because all of those people depend on coming to some kind
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	you'd keep to your contract
A	mm
B	if you didn't like the rent when you started why didn't you talk to us about it then?
A	mm
B	but we've made a commitment to switch the heating on because you'd said you'd pay your rent erm and you've used that heating
A	yeah
B	when you haven't kept your commitment you know all that stuff but you know that's why when we I said we must have a group running it structured so that they could make the hard decisions I said people with teeth
A	mm
B	they're crocodiles
A	yeah
B	people with teeth who could bite the bullet and say I'm sorry no
A	yeah
B	and it didn't come back
A	yeah
B	so you have to have a final decision made by someone who hasn't whose job wasn't about being
A	but that's really difficult I mean I still I get fed up of someone looking at me and thinking you know what you're a
B	mm
A	and they're the ones who are on the board
B	at least in the beginning
A	mm
B	but you need the right
A	mm
B	and at the beginning we certainly do get enough people but we
A	yeah
B	we're trying to do
A	yeah
B	but if the business of what we're trying to do failed then the whole building failed and
A	yeah
B	the church would be gone as well
A	yeah
B	erm
A	well actually what was quite interesting there was somebody as well
B	aha
A	and wants to know how many of us are
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	and I tried to teach churches for example again we were doing it when we set up
A	mm
B	because they've done that before and it failed because each of the
A	yeah
B	had the best in interest to not allowing
A	yeah
B	the rent to be realistic cos
A	yeah
B	they wanted to pay less
A	yeah
B	you've got to have a board that does it on the basis of the umbrella
A	yeah
B	building
A	yeah
B	and to keep it viable
A	yeah
B	that's the sole basis for your field and that includes co-opting people for their skills
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	of the diocese of
A	mm
B	the rest of you are co-opted members
A	mm
B	but you're co-opted for your skills
A	mm
B	er which was fundamentally the structure we started with
A	yeah
B	we're not office
A	and I sort of said
A	oh no you can just carry on and
B	well he he
A	but yeah
B	structured the only one he knows is the broker church council structure
A	mm
B	which should be rubbish for running this kind of thing and
A	mm
B	I'm trying to explain that to people that if you stay in the
A	yeah
B	not to be re-elected every year that allows you to
A	mm
B	to
A	mm
B	that have to be based
A	yeah
B	I know
A	get
B	but it it was
A	mm
A	yeah
B	and in a sense we couldn't trust the dioceses
A	yeah
B	cos it was hassle
A	mm
A	yeah
B	closed the major church in
A	yeah
B	etcetera so if you gave each of them a share neither of them could
A	mm
B	cos at the moment the dioceses from that structured point of view is more reliable than the
A	yeah
B	but there could come a point in the future when the diocese says we actually think we're gonna take this building over we've got the right to
A	yeah
B	and er that would be a good idea
A	well I mean if
B	yeah for the people in
A	yeah and
B	actual interpretation and
A	yeah
B	they would be a good tenant but they can come from
A	they might just change it
B	oh really?
A	yeah
A	mm
B	you know on the regeneration bit how what kind are there places you can't be generated
A	yeah
B	and that which ones are really susceptible to regeneration
A	yeah
B	where
A	mm
B	success in the past
A	mm
B	but ones that don't work are the things like the
A	yeah
B	where they'd never be
A	no
B	it's always been a
A	yeah
B	and all that stuff if you're gonna have a mix
A	and probably a mixed
B	yeah well and er er
B	but when they redeveloped
A	mm
B	and only a proportion of it was welfare and a a a lot of
A	yeah yeah
B	and it it it was a chance
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	and there were even when even in its bad days there
A	oh yeah erm somebody came somebody said to me the other day this bloke came out to where the
B	oh no
A	and there was some bloke who had a a mad theatre proposal and he was there
B	there was a guy and there was a guy who used to come who got very keen on it to find out there were only three of them working together to make it viable he was convinced he can manage and do the marketing someone else would be the director of programme
A	was he?
B	I and there was no way I could ever recognise him he was
A	no?
B	absolutely of another the planet but he got the right name and the right story so it had to be him
A	mm
B	but he came and said hello to me
A	mm
B	erm they actually hadn't got the ability to put on enough production to give themselves enough
A	yeah
B	income and they were totally dependent on well if utility can have the space we can apply to the arts council
A	yes
B	and get a grant
A	oh yeah
B	well the arts council do one-year grants they're not there's no long term
A	no
B	in that
A	no
B	you had to find someone who was fundamentally viable the guy who ends up
A	yeah yeah
B	not the cake
A	no
B	er and that was something else there we we must've seen ten theatres that
A	oh I know and actually there was one
B	well that's
B	the worst most angry that we handled there cos they
A	yeah
B	we need to do your business plan well he didn't know what a business plan was
A	no
B	so like
A	yeah what happened recently with this young man? and they really really talked tough that we wouldn't let them have the space
B	well
B	if we yeah and if we let you in you have to spare your deposit for when you move in
A	yeah
B	and you pay rent from day one
A	yeah and you
A	I have no money
B	you have no money so
A	yeah
B	we can't do it because
A	yeah
B	you can't put the heating on
A	yeah absolutely
B	you can't put the lights on and can you run a theatre with no lights and no heating?
A	mm
A	oh
B	colour
A	oh these are really really posh white people actually
B	and you're very ordinary looking people how dare you tell posh people like them that they can't have what they want?
A	yeah yeah they were
B	there was some visitor it reminded me of when I living in
A	aha
B	the old
A	oh yeah
B	so local people could go along
A	yeah
B	erm and there was a
A	oh yes yes yes er yes erm House of something Alba yes
B	yeah anyway this little theatre company supposedly was putting this on
B	and it got to the interval
B	and what it turned out was
A	oh my word
B	it was one of those typical
A	wow
B	for them to have to do their production in
A	oh right
B	no
A	oh
A	oh
B	in
A	no of course
B	cos
A	actually that was probably the one who came to tried to take the space the other year
B	probably was
A	and who runs a small phone company or
B	it could've been easy almost identical if it's not the space but how could a father do it twice I can't imagine
A	well he didn't in the end cos he wanted to rent he wanted the rent he wanted
B	wow
A	you know
B	well absolutely
A	and then with the
B	and having paid no money
A	and having paid no money after eighteen your eighteen month experiment to our expense
B	I did find that there were on one community premises the church was
A	mm
B	and they wanted erm a rent free period in return for having fitted the place out
A	mm
B	blah blah blah
A	and they set the place out
B	well absolutely and I said but it's not their money they haven't not a single penny of the organisation's money has been spent on anything like that that was entirely grant money it's entirely someone else's so it's not their money and they're now out of pocket
A	mm
B	cos their granny or somebody did it do you see what I mean?
A	yeah
B	er unthinking
A	yeah
B	nonsense
A	yeah
B	absolute nonsense
A	but it's also been taken by people actually it's also believing
B	yeah
A	whatever
B	oh absolutely
A	and taking absolutely a face value and
B	yeah
A	and thinking and actually it's taken me a long time to work out how people actually just lie to your face
B	well
A	yeah
B	push the button
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	when in the groups
A	mm
B	erm simply because that's the culture in their where they came from
A	mm
B	who er I've been mentioning their name
B	yeah
A	but that was asking you know it was like yeah you know all the actresses are really good I know you need to see this and this and
B	they promote people cos they can't do the job to
A	yeah
B	so that you can get rid of them
A	yeah
B	it happens in
A	mm
B	I mean in local governments and all that
A	mm
B	because it's very difficult to get rid of people on the grounds they're incompetent
A	yeah
B	okay so I think that's the first thing is to get your
A	yeah
B	your sustainability plan right
A	mm
B	your management your business planning your financial strategy and then all the things like
A	just to
B	your letting rent and everything have to work to that
A	yeah
B	erm and then you have to test out your potential users
A	mm
B	if you're going to have anyone there all the time
A	mm
B	if it just regular lettings then you never let anyone come in until they've paid their fee
A	yeah
B	or you take a big enough deposit from them that they only get back if they've got all of that stuff you safeguard yourself when you do it
A	yeah
B	I think the second step is
A	aha
B	saying there the second thing I think you do is to
A	right
B	including your own resources
A	aha
B	so I think once you determine what is actually needed and
A	yeah
B	how much of it and how you could do it in a way that is sustainable
A	yeah
B	so that's your market research really
A	yeah
B	or local audit in the charity
A	yeah
B	your second step is to find out where you are going to what is a realistic amount of capital
A	yeah
B	that you could raise to
A	yeah
B	to change
A	yeah
B	and that means reading thoroughly through the lottery sources
A	yeah
B	again it is something that the
A	yeah
B	er
A	well yeah
B	but then
