B	so
A	so how have they? how have? how are the two
B	yeah

B	cos I've gotta well the post office is shut now I gotta box that up and get it to the post office
B	it's not very heavy just
A	big box yeah the size of it'll still matter
A	yeah he joked at me I think what it

B	er
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	he said to me cos I read the fine ones he asked me to read the thing I read I could see them
A	mm
B	and he said well that's strange because normally people can't read the ones at the bottom
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so your eyes are fine?
A	yeah
B	it's a bit blurred when I get close
A	mm
B	there must be a very very slight difference if there is
A	it might just
B	so I've got so I've got four pairs
A	it might just be a case of
B	yeah they're probably
A	it prevented
B	there obviously is little difference between them
A	mm
B	but I can't physically see it so I've got four pairs of glasses
A	mental
B	I've got one at work
A	mm
B	there was that pair
B	mm
A	yeah
A	Mr Raccoon?
A	he doesn't no I I didn't I'd heard of him I didn't know what it was

A	and he he wrecks the place
A	I need to do some work
A	what time is it? ten to one
B	did a stop check yesterday I didn't count them
A	I was gonna say you did a stop check but you didn't count them?
A	mm
B	I've got to go
A	yeah what's that like?
B	it's nice actually
A	yes
A	ooh
B	ooh how did that not go in there
A	dunno how the keeper hasn't got the ball yet
A	keep smiling
B	it's great how they've painted they've redecorated the walls and stuff made the walls look
A	yeah
B	clean
A	who's looking at it who's like doing that?
B	mm?
A	who's doing that?
B	what?
A	like
B	they're they're they they do it themself
A	who they live there?
B	mm
A	and they're paying rent?
B	yeah
A	and you're letting them do it?
B	eh?
A	and you're just letting them? are they making it better?
B	well they've asked me to do to
A	that should be in the agreement surely whether they're allowed to paint or not
B	it is in the agreement
A	whether they're allowed to paint or not should be involved in the agreement
B	well they asked me
A	that they could paint everywhere yeah
B	but she said to me yeah we've
A	mm
B	erm and I said at the time I said to them as long as you're not putting any you're not putting any heavy colours on if you're gonna repaint it with light colours
A	pastel colours yeah
B	yeah and that's what she's done so I haven't got got a problem
A	yeah fair enough
B	but
A	I did
A	finish
B	pay the rent
A	well no yeah I
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and they lasted
A	mm
B	and then one of them two of them kept going off
A	yeah
A	brilliant
B	so they got angry and took them down and chuck them away
A	yeah I know
B	they said ah
A	no just ring the
B	for grandma?
A	yeah
B	yeah I know I said to him once I went there I said to him these why doesn't somebody do something about these? but anyway he
A	yeah
B	but I also wanna put a
A	why?
B	because they've got that back boiler thing
A	right
B	and they should have one in there
A	mm
B	so I'm gonna go and check it and they say they'll they'll maybe replace it completely
A	yeah
B	trouble is there's nowhere in the kitchen to put it
A	yeah I haven't seen that seen that place in years
B	haven't been there for years used to drive past and have a look
A	mm
A	yeah
B	but er
A	what's the place in Swindon like?
B	haven't been there for years either
A	is it making any money?
B	it's
A	cos
B	when it's full
A	mm
B	and that other company's actually charging me less
A	it's
B	erm
A	it's decent
A	mm
B	I rung the water board said they kept
A	mm
B	I rung the I rung the people and said to them look Thames Water wanna come and check the meter
A	mm
B	to sort it out
A	mm
B	just ask one of the tenants roughly when they're gonna be home and arrange or something they'd be there and they give me all sorts of crap but they never went
B	cos they we could never
A	yeah
B	but since this since this erm
A	mm
B	and I haven't paid electric for any electricity for two quarters
A	right
B	well yes
A	can't it?
B	it could go very badly
A	mm
B	but I've obviously been overpaying
A	yeah
B	so they know the gas
A	do they take it off the bill that you would pay?
B	yeah
A	good we've got
B	I've got it here actually is it?
A	our water estimate is for a four bedroom house
B	a hundred and thirty quid in debit
A	a hundred and thirty quid? oh so they owe you a hundred and thirty quid?
B	mm
A	decent
B	mm
A	despite there being seven of us living there
A	so we pay nothing in comparison to what we actually should be paying
B	mm
A	and we don't pay council tax cos we're students so
B	this is the gas bill
A	they owe you three hundred and seventy quid?
B	so they owe me five hundred quid
A	jeez
B	altogether
A	mm
B	and I thought it was because somebody new had moved in but when I did check the bill it was an estimated bill
A	right
B	and
A	just sort it out yeah
B	and I keep saying
A	absolute nightmare defending
B	asked me if
A	yeah
B	so they obviously knew I was we were getting complaints
A	it's the first time I've seen him play
A	they were just shouting Chelsea reject at him
B	like footballers?
B	oh yeah the on the erm
A	the lower league ones aren't but
B	this and the
A	really?
B	they were saying the other night I I just got a glimpse of it something I was watching
A	yeah
B	who's gonna spend a hundred and seventy on
B	obviously not gonna spend it are you?
A	depends how nice your house is
B	well if your house is that nice it wouldn't cost you anything to heat
A	er true I suppose
B	because
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so you don't pay yeah
A	solar panels and whatever
B	yeah whatever is
A	mm
B	it
A	mm
B	well we had some heat pads we bought some heat pads
A	yeah
B	obviously neon
A	yeah
B	cos a lot
A	can you use halogen lamps?
B	yeah you can use halogen lamps
A	cos they're supposed to heat the
B	I dunno they're
A	yeah but I've heard they they're
B	no like you can touch the bulb they don't they don't er
A	yeah they don't emit heat as such but they
B	that's why they erm
A	halogen yeah
A	they they yeah they're just they're painful it
B	mm
A	cos if you think like a Premier League footballer
B	fifty grand a year?
A	no
B	mm
A	mm
B	they get sponsored
A	yeah they don't have to pay for
B	erm
A	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	because he could do and they were like no that's not how we do things over here
A	you get get this one but
B	mm
A	so he just got like the most flashy one he could
B	yeah they give you even in cricket
A	IPL and
B	yeah but the the county county cricketers get given cars
A	yeah
B	because it's advertisement for them
A	yeah yeah
B	you see
A	yeah
B	cos he's got one
A	puts you in the same bracket as him
B	yeah so they don't they don't they're not gonna spend it
A	and one one car to them isn't an isn't a big deal
B	no
A	yeah I
B	mm
A	which is the trouble for lower league footballers because
A	something to do when I finish
B	mm
A	cos he's got like seven houses he's
B	these guys
A	mm
B	yeah they work for broadcasting agencies it's like Henri he just swans round to Sky
A	does what he wants
A	cos he's eloquent he's very eloquent
A	Jamie?
B	yeah what Jamie was saying
A	everyone
B	but they erm
A	it's yeah but the top ones have got it easy
B	Merson
A	yeah on Gillette Soccer Saturday
B	yeah he just says
A	yeah he's
A	but he yeah he obviously got rid of loads of his money but because he was a footballer he's now got a job in punditry so he's earning a
B	mm
A	he won't be on he won't be on millions he won't be on probably won't be on hundreds of thousands working for them but
B	mm
A	cos it's not something that age is gonna dictate
B	mm but Beckham was the same
A	yeah
B	had a squeaky
A	yeah without going you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	know what I mean?
A	but now yeah he's he's brilliant he's an ambassador for things he's talking in front of people and
B	it's cos people like him you see he can talk all sorts of shit and nobody will
A	I don't even listen to them I just stare at his face
A	the guy makes me sick
B	mm
A	they'll get him in to talk
A	it's insane
B	doesn't bear thinking about
A	yeah
B	pure madness
A	the thing is I suppose like with that you give yourself you
B	you know even if you did that
A	yeah
B	you just start you start buying stuff
A	what's there
B	yeah it's
A	but I'd rather have that much money than than not have it and have to worry about it
B	mm
A	it's the car innit?
B	mm?
A	it's the car innit?
B	the car where?
A	mm I thought it was mum arriving
B	what could it be bringing?
A	permeate? what's that?
A	mm
B	used to be wood
A	mm
A	relax
A	mm
B	they want a
A	mm
B	but she said
A	mm
B	is leaking
A	yeah
B	change the pipe first and see if it makes any difference
A	mm
B	back to work at two
A	mm
A	I think I
A	I've always complained about mum moaning about driving in the dark I don't like driving in the dark purely because it just tires my eyes out I think
B	I love driving in the dark
A	you love it?
B	I love driving in the dark it's a lot easier
A	I much prefer driving in the day
B	the roads are quieter and if you're driving in the country
A	but they're not
B	if you drive in the countryside
A	yeah you work off lights
B	mm
A	it's dark
A	innit?
A	that's the thing as well they can just step into anything like
B	they they were erm
A	Waitrose you want me to do an advert for you?
A	I've seen a Beckham advert recently I dunno what
B	and they said oh you shouldn't've done that
A	I dunno why they need to but
A	yeah
B	with someone like Beckham
A	still not interested
B	and
A	two
B	and they up it to
A	yeah
B	you know? because these people sell stuff
A	and like
B	like someone like Beckham get loads of money
A	but yeah I know but like just in terms of
B	oh the advert?
A	yeah like
B	doing doing the thing yeah
A	it's not
B	so what's up with doing
A	no he loves it he's a
B	mm
A	and I've just I've been thinking the last couple of days about sponsorships as well
B	mm
A	if I can get hold of a sponsor a decent sponsor
B	mm
A	I dunno who
B	mm
A	and I'm not really pressured with it but
A	yeah I've already got one
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah cos you can probably get so many
A	yeah exactly and the
