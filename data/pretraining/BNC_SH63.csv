B	ah
A	obviously change over days
B	maybe
A	maybe I dunno why
B	I wanna go disco
A	I don't know why they can't have a disco on a changeover day
B	don't know
A	I didn't know where it was
B	probably in that bit with the slide
A	oh yeah I'm worth it
B	I've not heard this one
A	even the modern one no I have
B	have you?
A	yeah
B	how have you heard this?
A	don't know
B	discos?
A	well like you know
B	you haven't been embarking yourself have you?
A	actually the one that like I said the one at the DHP conference
B	mm
A	really successful everyone was just basically everyone in the whole room went one the dance floor and I've not seen that before at a British conference
B	god
A	but it was the eighties it was an eighties band and they were playing they were sort of all dressed up
B	I know but did they play anything did they play anything you knew?
A	I knew all of it
B	really?
A	yeah pretty much
B	are you sure?
A	they even even like Phil Collins we were up there
B	no well obviously you know Phil ones you don't that you would have known all of them
A	no
B	no
A	there were a couple of tracks that I didn't but mostly I'd say ninety per cent
B	really?
A	and then I'd say fifty per cent I could sing along too
B	I've taught you well
A	they even did the Ghostbusters song
A	Back to the Future
B	yeah
A	no but it was quite no it was it was really good
B	well it sounds like sounds like all the best of the eighties for sure
B	did they do Nellie the Elephant?
B	no that would have had the German's up
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	kind of I I sort of felt like I should have maybe spoken to her a bit more cos she obviously you know British conference and a lot of people just assume everyone else is British so
B	yeah could have invited her to stay?
A	why?
B	I don't know
A	that would have been a bit weird hello I've met you a few times would you like to stay with me?
B	well
A	oh I see right I I get it I get it I see where you're going with that
B	I still want to see a room so small
B	yeah you fucking should've
A	it wasn't just that it was literally the floor was like hard
B	alright alright
A	the
B	what what exactly well you know this isn't the time but what? never mind
A	it's a natural
B	why were you er even walking her to the station?
A	cos I was trying to get her to the fucking train
B	so?
A	to get her last train
B	yeah well why couldn't she just do it by herself?
A	because she wasn't going anywhere
B	she could have got the bus
A	and I wanted to go home
B	why were you there?
A	because I knew her cos there a few of us went a like
B	yeah
A	I wasn't in the train station with her
B	mm
A	no she she said I I was
B	mm
A	I was trying to work out when she needed to get home cos she needed to go back to Brighton
B	mm
A	she said her last train was I don't know one I I don't know when it was one o'clock or something and I knew the tubes tended to stop around half twelve so it was like getting that way it was like we should go you should go and then I was I wanted to go home anyway I was being a gentlemen
B	mm
A	but then when we got to the tube station the shutters were across
B	oh this song sounds shit
A	and you liked the last one?
B	no
A	trust me I was quite
B	wasn't your stalker from the last conference was it?
A	who was the stalker from the last conference?
B	I don't know
A	I don't know who that is
B	I dunno
A	it's not uncommon in psychological conferences
B	oh
A	no just because there aren't very many blokes
B	oh I see
A	well you can peddle down on
A	on the Minnie Mouse mobile
B	yeah
A	it is if you go that way it's pretty steep
B	yeah
B	might do might go to the disco
A	well it's not on tonight
B	well I'll make my own disco
A	yeah I don't think there's much I think it's the place to come for nightlife
B	no no kidding so
A	yeah
B	when can we get in the pool?
A	er eight
B	no no no because we've got pony riding or some shit
A	oh okay
B	our first thing isn't pony riding though is it? it's something else
A	I don't think so no
B	keep talking to the table
A	I think pony riding is a bit later
B	that entertainment or whatever it is sounds awful
A	well look we can ditch it I'm just saying
B	ah
A	it's just something going on
B	oh
A	I thought the girls might like it but we can
B	I know but I'm thinking
A	if we're there and it makes sense to be there anyway we can check it out if not we can ditch and head off to a playground
B	I know
A	I
B	is it indoors or outdoors?
A	I think it's outdoors
B	mm
A	it was near the bowling
B	your thing's glowing

A	no it's not
B	it is it's it's it's got it's a light of its own
A	no it has not

A	you're just full of shit
A	it was the
B	it was just a very no it was just a very lurid green
A	it's called a reflection
B	no it's just a very lurid green and
A	it did because it was just
B	I know but look at that
A	you know you know that's what makes colour don't you? the reflection of light
A	not in my head
B	no no nothing is colour
A	now this is a tune
A	only I'm not sure if it's surpassed by er
A	Let Me Be Your Fantasy and then erm
A	that's the track
B	oh
A	I think this is better
B	no
A	I Need Your Loving

B	I think we should
A	be
B	mm does look cool
A	oh this is actually the Miami song
B	yeah
A	I thought you I thought it was a different
B	no
A	they're in a big boat in this video aren't they?
B	I don't know not seen it
A	they're driving a speed boat in Miami it's pretty cool
A	Jet Skis palm trees
B	quite a big place isn't it?
A	yeah
B	like
A	well I'm impressed that they've got two en suites I suppose they have to really
B	mm but like if you think about our first house
A	yeah
B	like
A	mm I know what you mean
B	mm
A	I'd say the footprint of our downstairs is bigger than here
B	mm and then there's the bedrooms
A	no I mean no sorry the footprint as in the ground floor
B	mm mm
A	what?
B	what?
A	what is it?
B	I said tune
A	doesn't sound like it
B	Frankie
A	oh
B	no I mean
B	and that second bedroom is quite big
A	yeah mm
B	it was a little house
A	it did quite a lot for its size
B	it did
A	it was
B	erm
A	well I mean it actually to be fair if you think about the lounge it was quite a big room
B	yeah it was just the only room
A	and the kitchen diner
B	yeah but it was basically no I mean
A	no but yeah you're right no you're right
B	I dunno like you could see yourself easily managing to live in this space as a family it's a big old space
A	you could but
B	no it's nice
A	no no it is but think about the kids
B	yeah fuck them
A	but you've got a sofa fair enough that's fine
B	yeah they can play on that they can play on the sofa
A	yeah but if you know
B	no what toys?
A	no I mean yeah absolutely it would be be totally fine but
A	mm
B	like seriously if you had a fire
A	it's probably one of those things it's just there to make you feel better
B	well it's powder but I mean like seriously that's about a litre of powder
A	well no darling they put them under pressure don't they?
B	yeah I know but I'm just saying that's like a litre
A	no but
B	doesn't matter about the pressure
A	it does
B	fucking doesn't
A	does
B	no
A	if you squash something down you can get more of it in
B	don't be silly
A	that's with water
B	what's this?
A	but if you have a C O one
B	what's this?
A	no
B	anyway I'm just saying it's a it's a very small amount of powder powder's powder
A	no
B	no don't no you don't need to go near it you don't need to tell me about it I'm just saying powder's powder you can't fit any more powder into that than
A	you might be able to
B	well you can't you can't well
A	you can with
B	yeah well yachts are quite small
A	not all of them
B	and you're also surrounded by water in a yacht
A	that's funnily enough that doesn't help if you've got a fire
B	that's gonna be quite that's gonna be quite helpful it
A	ultimately it does when it sinks but you're trying to avoid the boat sinking
B	what
A	mm
B	mm
A	doesn't really work like that
B	well either way that's a very small fire extinguisher
A	engine compartments are quite difficult to get to
B	well
A	that's not what the RYA say
B	you think it's gonna be an an engine fire?
A	that's a
B	yeah yeah well
A	not in this house
B	I don't think we'll have an engine fire no
A	no
B	yeah well absolutely
A	and it doesn't
B	I would expect nothing less
A	the point being is er er er an engine fire can be quite difficult to put out
A	did we you know no no fire brigade that does any kind of fire training recommends people actually try and put fires out themselves generally unless there's like a whole bunch of
B	blah
A	get some water on your way back
B	erm maybe
A	I don't know
B	if it's ten to ten
A	it's okay
