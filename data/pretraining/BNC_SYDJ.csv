A	it's them little old mice seem to
B	they do
A	I dunno they they know where they are and they come back for em
B	mm
A	yeah
A	I dunno why
A	I mean he he runs up to next door where where the sweet chestnut is it's at up the corner of the road there
B	no it's across the road here

A	mm
B	cos he he mows round it

B	yeah but it's kind of for anyone to go in isn't it?
A	and people have picnics in there
B	no I haven't
A	oh
B	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think that's wrong that you should put vehicles in there
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they look really nice mm
A	the only problem we I used to have when I was a kid we used to go chestnutting
B	yeah
A	and the white pith come off in the middle
B	mm
A	instead of going brown
B	what? and eat them raw?
A	and eat them raw
B	yeah?

B	are they? oh
A	they are
A	no? what? English chestnuts is they're wonderful when they're
B	well my my
A	and slightly under-ripe they're so sweet
A	yeah I used to get roast chestnuts
B	roast chestnuts
A	yeah
B	oh it was lovely
A	you still had to peel em
B	I know but it was they were so hot and
A	we used to roast em in front of the fire and if you don't pierce them they explode
B	they do
B	mm
A	but we used to get loads of chestnuts
B	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	she said they were unlucky
B	yeah
A	taking over the world
B	a shame isn't it?
A	yeah
B	there'll always be English bluebells though I don't think they'll
A	well the the other ones are big thugs aren't they? they have thick leaves that's the problem
B	mm
A	I mean bluebells come up in er in the woods in English woods
B	mm
A	and that's why they're wonderful
B	yeah
A	but they are gorgeous really gorgeous
B	we haven't been for about three years now
A	what? at
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	or or the other place that's nice
B	erm some National Trust one? wasn't it?
A	I can't remember what it was called
B	I can't remember either
A	I think
B	but I like
A	er that was the best
B	yeah
A	if you can call a wood
B	yeah but it's all coming back now isn't it?
A	three hundred years old they were
B	mm
A	and the idiots cut them down
B	mm
A	they built all them big er skyscraper things like
B	yeah they did didn't they?
A	and they were all damp and horrible
B	yeah
A	they
B	mm
A	but there you go they had to house all them people at the time so
B	was it a cheaper way of? it must've been a cheaper way of building
A	well
B	just concrete
A	yeah and that they used to have these big
B	mainly wasn't it? the tower blocks
A	they used to have these big er concrete precast concrete that's what they used to call it
B	yeah
A	and they used to just stick em up and bolt em all together
B	mm
A	the concrete reacted with the steel rods
B	react
A	and that just blew the concrete off and rotted the
B	what a mistake eh?
A	well that was a quick way to build
B	mm
A	and they didn't know about that they didn't even
B	no they couldn't
A	well
B	mm
A	I suppose they got got over it now I don't know cos they still have to have steel rods to reinforce it
B	yeah
A	oh god yeah
B	yeah
A	the white one not the blue one
B	yeah
A	well they say if you if you if you er seal it that's fine
B	mm
A	but the people who put them up in the first place had to drill them holes in to hold hold the roofs on
B	yeah
A	no
B	yes they did
A	they did
B	yeah
A	I don't know what one that was
B	mm
A	once you once you start playing about with it
B	yeah
A	and of course the ironing board covers used to just sort of disintegrate didn't they?
B	like cardboard weren't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	used for to kill flies
A	yeah that's carcinogenic can you remember that time we stopped
A	by the road and that aeroplane was spraying the
A	spraying the fields
B	mm
A	with the window open? that come
B	it did
A	weren't that terrible? they banned all that in the end
B	mm
A	yeah
B	people you know they used to say keep the windows closed cos it's they're spraying the fields today
A	I remember when
B	now they don't do it
A	she
B	yes it did yeah
A	she went lairy didn't she? poor old girl
B	ah
A	god knows but they were the contractors that were to blame then not her
B	yeah I know but they did they sprayed everywhere didn't they?
A	they did yeah
B	mm right
A	yeah
B	I suppose they're still discovering things aren't they? that are
A	well you just think what we went through when we were kids they were they had that Flit fly spray
B	mm
A	and that was in a little canister and you
B	yeah
A	pumped it
B	that was DDT
A	and that was DDT
B	yeah
A	and all that
B	what does that stand for?
A	huh? I don't know what it stand for
B	dangerous
A	but all that stuff all that DDT got into the rivers
B	mm
A	and er ruined the fishing
B	yeah
A	and it also killed thrushes because they ate the
B	mm big chain reaction
A	that was a chain reaction
B	mm
A	and now we got
B	Ebola
A	Ebola
B	how are they gonna stop that? don't know how they're gonna stop it do they?
A	no they don't know how they're gonna stop it
B	if someone comes up for a cure soon
A	but why didn't they stop it in the first place? when when that hit Rwanda or wherever it was I think it was Rwanda ain't it?
B	yeah
A	when that hit that place
B	but they obviously didn't know it was gonna spread like it did
A	well they should do cos Ebola was terrible
B	yeah
A	otherwise it wouldn't have a name
B	yeah
A	I mean if that was something new they would go oh whatever's that? and
B	well the symptoms are like flu though aren't they?
A	seventy-five percent of people die from it
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	no
A	now they think
B	yeah
A	but the whole point about these diseases are they come along and kill off so many people
B	yeah
A	live
B	yes it's
A	it's a weird old world it's I mean it's been happening ever since man began if you like ain't it?
B	mm
A	diseases and what have you
B	yeah
A	I mean what happened to er the American Indians? or no the Incas and the Aztecs rather
B	yeah
A	they didn't know they took it over
B	yeah it's strange isn't it?
A	yeah cos they'd never
B	mm
A	keep in your house
A	don't go out
B	keep away from everyone
A	everyone become hermits
B	yeah
A	then there'd be no spreading of diseases
B	but will it
A	no because
B	caught it?
A	what what what they reckon this Ebola thing becomes more contagious in a dead body
B	really?
A	yes
B	oh dear
A	they had er a dead body laying in the in the street for three days
B	er
A	and the the people rioted they
A	rioted because that dead body had been in the street
B	oh
A	and they had to send all these
B	yeah
A	to remove the dead body
B	so why was it left there?
A	cos no
A	no one
B	didn't they know?
A	yeah they knew but no one daren't dare go near it
B	oh I see
A	I mean if people go near it they catch it
B	yeah
A	and apparently that er that's only
B	yeah
A	or you're breathing breathe it in or you
B	you can breathe it can't you? that's the that's the problem
A	whatever
B	mm
A	and now now they're they're screening people coming into this country
B	yeah
B	oh
A	to control it
A	I mean they now sent they now sent loads of Britain has sent a load of of er they've sent a ship a hospital ship
B	mm
A	and troops
B	yeah
A	and medical staff and special isolation
B	mm
A	places where where they can isolate people
A	I don't know I don't know whether there's an antidote or what or whether there's a injection
B	there's a programme actually tonight er er all about it
A	is there?
B	yeah
A	oh we'll have to watch that then
B	erm
A	yeah
B	should know about it
A	well have you recorded it? or?
B	no I haven't
A	yeah it'd be better if you recorded it and then we can watch it any time instead of
B	yeah
A	wasting time watching things
B	yeah
A	you need to know yeah
B	you can't play ignorant just er really and hope it'll just go away
A	it's awful
B	mm
A	I mean the nurse in in er that er bloke who died in America the nurse has also got it
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so from the fact you think you might have it to the fact that you might die
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well if that's just flu symptoms
B	yeah
A	so they are the symptoms of Ebola
B	yeah
A	no
B	mm
A	well this is the
B	yeah
A	so everybody who come in here we'll have to spray with DDT
B	which is banned
B	mm
A	or we put up a
B	yeah
A	we we can have our groceries delivered
B	yeah
A	and then we we can go out there with er
A	with all the gear on
A	and then
B	masks and that I suppose
A	the bloke can dump it outside the gate we can go and fetch em so we don't have to look at him
B	well in China not long ago they were all wearing face masks weren't they?
A	well that was only because of the pollution
B	that's just pollution was it?
A	that was terrible pollution
B	I thought there was a problem with all sorts of diseases
A	no that isn't that's that's terrible pollution and
B	yeah
A	and apparently they they get lots of er respiratory trouble
B	mm
A	because of the pollution you heard what
B	yes it's awful
