A	so today is well er the first of only four days cos it's gonna be a four-day week this week at school
B	wahoo
A	so on Friday you're gonna come with me to one of my lessons
A	and assist me in the teaching of it
C	oh
B	yeah
A	but you were thinking of baking doing some baking for my students?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	so what are your thoughts on that?
C	well we obviously have to know about er rock cakes cos they are so delicious
A	your your fantastic rock cakes yes
C	mm
A	and they are triple chocolate chip
C	yeah triple chocolate rock cakes
A	and er that's not easy to say is it really?
C	triple chocolate rock cakes triple chocolate rock cakes
A	no triple chocolate chip rock cakes
C	yeah it's triple triple
A	that's the bit that's tricky
C	and look at the recipe
A	what?
C	look at the recipe
A	er triple oh triple chocolate rock cakes that's still hard to say though isn't it?
C	mm triple chocolate rock cakes
A	and what else were you thinking that you wanted to have as well?
C	well
B	erm your muffins
C	we could do a mixture of vanilla and chocolate muffins
A	yes we could
C	but we could do a little bit of icing on top because last time you didn't
A	we didn't well well er we didn't I didn't have time to do the icing cos you snaffled them very quickly didn't you?
C	yeah but now we do
A	yeah well the yeah so they were fudge cupcakes
B	mm
A	so we can have the fudge topping but I'm glad that you really liked the the cupcakes so that's good and we could go healthy eating and do ones with cherries and apple which are delicious
B	oh yeah
C	hey I've got
A	cos you really really liked them when you were little
C	and maybe we can put a little batch of chocolate sauce and have some like
A	what? what like when we did the kebabs do you mean? or?
C	yeah
A	a sauce to dip the fruit in?
C	yeah
A	well I think that's going a bit over the top there
C	well
B	oh I just
C	and we could get some fruit as well just so after those we could give them some refreshments
B	mum
A	well they're we're gonna have a Greek salad cos one of them's making a Greek salad
B	mum in your lesson
A	yes
B	er could we play the game where you say where somebody starts off a story with one word like there
A	mm?
B	and the other person says erm and the word that we use to make a sentence with that word
C	there was a pirate poo poo pants
B	no a goat
A	mm?
B	eating grass on a farm
C	no they don't have to make sense there was a banana eating
B	but
C	flowers on a on a school ground
B	but
A	is this what you play at school?
B	erm no
C	okay let's start
A	well explain the game a bit more to me?
B	so
C	I'll explain it
B	one person that says a word to start off a story the next person says another word the two carry on the story and then
A	but you have to
B	yeah so it makes you think about them but I'll
A	I think that some of my students might find that a bit tricky
C	no it's only for that they and they can do there was there was a big man eating giant
B	well
A	the reason why it's tricky though
C	there
B	once
A	oh good grief
C	was
A	well once was doesn't make sense there was
C	there was there
A	was
B	was
A	a
C	banana

C	banana
B	happily
C	down
A	the
B	aeroplane

C	it's bouncy for us I'm always bouncing on it
A	it's bouncy if it's got you know
A	if it's on a bed but just on its own it's not that good so I do really need a crash mat and also I need to stop doing it because I really hurt my back
A	so I'm just gonna carry on practising handstands against the wall but I did do quite a good handstand yesterday

A	mm
B	they'll probably think we're adorable
A	yeah they've all got they've all got children themselves
A	so they'll really like you guys
B	you should make it so that we're erm so that we're they're allowed to bring their children to school
