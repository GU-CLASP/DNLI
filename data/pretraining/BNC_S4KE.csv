A	and it was a bloody old diddicoy man
A	old travellers on an estate that have settled
B	oh
A	and they were into it was an hour long a complete waste of time it wasn't relevant to what I was looking for but I got sucked into it anyway listening to him talk for an hour and I'd ask him words like what would you say for this and what would you say for that and it was making me realise all these words so when
A	he said he didn't know I was like you like that's another word I didn't realise parnyard gattered gattered is another one yeah erm
B	cos you've been brought up with them
A	yeah I really didn't there's still some and because also I think I think I use them around people in Medway and I think
B	yeah
A	or they use them themselves
B	yeah
A	but it's not until you speak to someone outside of that area and realise no no I don't don't know what that means at all
A	but he sounded like his accent he did sound like dad as well there is slightly different pronunciations going on there and things
B	that might be where erm
B	erm
A	oh right well yeah these they were talking about their
B	oh
A	but they said they still cook in pots out in the garden and that cos they don't think it tastes right if they don't and things like that and they were talking about kids mixing at school they said there were some actual travellers there too that weren't in houses
B	oh
A	and they were talking about the mix and what goes on there and stuff the woman was er from Kent she'd married her husband was the one that had been a traveller but or his family used to be or something
