B	sounds like there's loads of drums in that
A	yeah they're so good live though
B	really?
A	with that album yeah you can see they really worked for it
B	and they still had the same amount of people? like they have erm
A	yeah they've got one more now though they've erm recruited
B	oh okay oh hence the electric sounds
A	but he's very good yeah but he's very good

B	really? kind of Coldplayish?
A	erm ish can be yeah some of them are pretty cool so erm yeah they've got
B	oh
A	like depending on the song but yeah I'll let you have a listen
B	like the Wombats
A	they're really good really good

B	did you say they work well together?
A	I said they're doing erm they're doing a live
B	oh they are yeah
A	what's it called?
B	they were at the
A	are they?
B	they were yeah
A	oh okay oh yeah the Radio 1 Big Weekend
B	yeah yeah
A	that was good
B	yeah but you were at Big Day Out so
A	I was
A	no it was good though
B	imagine if Coldplay were at
A	yeah
A	erm did you hear about
B	oh really?
A	yeah from Pitch Perfect
B	oh really?
B	I'm really pleased that I didn't know what that song was until you said that
A	yeah
B	erm how does it go?
A	no
B	okay
A	erm no it's erm yeah I didn't know it cos obviously
B	did anyone know it?
A	er quite a lot were singing it yeah they got he got pretty much everyone there singing it basically they do this thing for like
B	that's crazy
A	erm half way through their worship at the end of the night they say and they said it on Sunday night
B	yeah
A	they say if you wanna
B	yeah
A	if they wanna do it the first time say it and then afterwards they get them to put their phone light up so then obviously it
B	oh yeah
A	lights up the place
B	yeah
A	and then after that
A	erm
A	yeah
B	I love that
A	erm Tim Hughes was amazing though
A	you could tell he's so much on fire now again like he
B	yeah
A	I dunno he just seemed liked after their last album you thought oh okay it was going a bit quiet wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	and then he done his own album
B	mm
A	Pocket of Faith and that on it
B	oh yeah
A	and then after this
B	wow
A	seems so much on fire
B	he's like
A	I wanna go and see him to be honest
B	well yeah yeah seriously I saw an article in the Guardian about it
A	right
B	I'm such an old man
A	yeah
B	yeah I think that'd be a cool thing to do
A	yeah
B	is it's similar to the erm
A	I dunno erm I'm assuming it'll be fairly lively
A	erm
B	it's centred around music isn't it? and arts and that sort of thing
A	yeah we were meant yeah we were meant to go up there for erm part of our course
B	oh okay
A	just to like have an interview with him and everything but
B	oh right
A	didn't quite come off
B	oh what would you've asked him?
A	I'd have asked him a few questions I think actually it'd be about
A	cos yeah from what I've heard it sounded like it was a bit of an experience for them all cos obviously they'd never done it before
B	yeah
A	and it was a bit of a trip erm
B	in
A	yeah but erm yeah I've heard so many like people talk about well church leaders talking about
B	yeah
A	someone who you
B	yeah
A	I don't know if you've heard of him
B	I remember you saying er it was the book is called erm oh don't tell me er Stand?
A	don't know that one
B	oh okay I think he's written a book called Stand
A	right
B	if it's the same guy
A	be worth reading
B	yeah
A	he's
A	as well as that you can really see his heart for God which is cool
B	mm that's cool
A	cos there's so many people you hear on
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	sort of thing but with him you can just see that's how he is
B	yeah that's cool and like the same with
A	yeah I just really
B	mm
A	I really enjoyed what he said on Sunday
B	that was cool
A	that was quite cute
B	yeah
A	okay
B	you know the?
A	that was brilliant
B	but I didn't it was like
B	really wrong ground for that
A	it would've been brilliant though next time
A	yeah it would've been cool though
B	that's really cool that is yeah
A	it'd be quite nice to actually have a group of lads our age who do the same thing
B	yeah yeah
A	just a message saying this is where I'm up to
B	yeah
A	this is how my week's been this is how my day's been
B	yeah do you do you like have anyone like that here?
A	a couple I have
B	I guess like
B	oh yeah yeah yeah he's quite cool though
A	erm but yeah
B	yeah
A	which is quite cool
B	yeah
A	and then obviously like family
B	yeah
B	yeah that's true
A	but yeah I wouldn't say there's anyone really my age
B	mm
A	that I'm
B	yeah how's
A	good he's erm
A	yeah he's erm
A	he's recovering now from his
B	yeah
A	problems with his illness but yeah I think he's alright now
A	sort of back to the gym now and starting to
B	yeah
A	so everyone thinks oh he's absent from church but it's not
B	no
A	it's not like that
B	yeah
A	he's just been busy
A	yeah it is you know it's like it's the non-judgement zone but we're gonna judge anyway
B	it's a non-judgement zone apart from the people who know stuff about the Bible
A	yeah
B	and then we're gonna judge
A	yeah
B	no that's cool
A	mm
B	did you say he's going to the gym again?
A	yeah
A	he used to love the gym
B	yeah I make use of the gym gym monkey
A	yeah
B	erm I do a few days a week and then one day of circuits and one day is rest
A	oh okay
B	so
B	the circuits is always quite fun we started doing it with a bunch of guys from church who used to go down onto the field and do it
A	okay
B	all together at like seven o'clock in the morning and er we did it twice
B	cos it was just so bad
A	yeah
B	cos your hands'd get so cold cos of the dew and then
A	right
A	get some gloves
B	yeah yeah that's true one guy turned up in gloves
A	mm
A	bet he done both weeks as well
B	yeah he did yeah
B	he's a very
A	yeah
B	yeah it's quite cool at uni though
A	yeah
B	there's er lots of people you'd like
A	yeah
B	yeah I guess
B	oh okay cool erm er
A	okay
B	probably erm I remember when I first met him it was at Bible study
A	right
B	and erm I was like oh no like here's here's another guy I've got to like enjoy getting along with cos it's Bible study
A	right
B	but that's he was a really cool guy and we just er yeah got to know each other a lot I reckon that'd be the answer
A	cool
B	erm
A	did it take time? like one of those
B	mm
A	one of those like cos sometimes you can talk to people and then you're straight away you're talking about last week and stuff like that
B	mm
A	or was it one of those that you had to get to know him first sort of thing?
A	mm
B	so that helps erm but yeah I think I think you're right I think it just er takes a bit of time
A	mm
B	we used to walk to morning prayer together I guess so that kind of helped
A	yeah
A	that's cool
B	yeah
A	brilliant
B	and then I would have to preach the next week
B	and we would just
B	and we'd have to preach about like something you found inspiring on the page
A	for twenty minutes as well
B	mm
B	that's a really long time
A	yeah
A	things you do
B	things you do for laughs mm
A	how is that game that
B	do you know we haven't played it
A	have you not?
B	yeah if you come up we will play it again
A	yeah
B	erm but yeah we've moved on to like more sensible things like garden cricket and
A	beer pong
B	beer pong
B	beer pong yeah
A	yes
A	it's such a perfect game erm yeah I'm thinking so when you go back in September
B	mm
A	if we go up a little bit earlier I can take you and
B	okay that's not a bad idea actually
A	I thought that'd be good
B	erm do you have room in my in your car for all the stuff?
A	yeah yeah cos it it'd just be me
B	oh okay
B	okay there's actually a boot camp happening actually on that week as well
A	okay
B	erm you could join in erm
A	tell them I'm a fresher
B	fresher
A	yeah
B	and how the logistics of getting up for that are gonna work
A	yeah well I'm assuming you'll wanna go up a bit earlier anyway won't you? to try and settle back in?
B	mm potentially yeah
A	are you gonna be living in the same house again?
B	yeah
A	that'll be alright then
B	erm
A	have you spoken to the landlord about that?
B	about living er in the same house?
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	oh yeah erm
B	no we haven't really they're still there
A	okay
B	they're still gonna be there for like another week
A	okay cool but yeah it'd be good be nice to spend some time
B	yeah okay that's a good option I like that
A	mm
B	I'll erm
B	sorry oh was he? oh that's cool that's cool legend
A	oh yeah
A	how have you found that? living just the three of you?
B	erm good yeah it's been really nice
A	and she hasn't minded too much?
B	I don't think she minds us too much I think she's got used to us
B	I think I've got used to
A	okay
B	I like a little bit more space
A	yeah you've got a whole floor to yourself
B	I've got a whole floor to myself
A	and you've got the kitchen
B	yeah but they're good erm yeah they're really nice guys er you're still living in your house aren't you?
A	yeah
B	is that going well? or are you thinking of
A	yeah it is good obviously you always have these ideas that oh I'd like to do certain things but for now I think it's just about trying to get enough money to try and sort out a few things
B	yeah
A	I'd like a new car
B	yeah?
A	just cos mine's obviously going to
B	okay yeah yeah
A	so it's good to sell it whilst it's still got a reasonable amount on it so you get a good price before you
B	oh okay yeah that's good thinking
A	yeah and then see what jobs and stuff cos obviously depending on what I do next year will depend on where I live
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	yeah
B	does so does your contract
A	yeah I finish
A	erm sorry for my?
A	my yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I'd like to move out of my work at a similar time though hopefully
B	mm
A	if I have to stay on for a bit whilst I try and find something then
A	there's not a time limit on that
B	yeah
A	but yeah see what
B	something similar?
A	see what
B	or something completely different? in the words of John Cleese
A	who knows? I mean I
B	yeah
A	as well as something like a learning to do something for the future
B	yeah yeah
A	cos obviously I haven't done uni now
B	yeah
A	which is a big up and down at the same time
B	yeah I think it's a big up in many in many respects
A	yeah for someone like me who has just done the year I've done I'd I'd rather do that
B	yeah yeah
A	and still not a hundred percent know cos like even if I've started uni I've
B	yeah
A	when I could've not needed to do
B	yeah
A	something
B	yeah that's er
A	so
B	yeah that's good thinking
B	yeah that was cool I guess it's good cos it's kind of like your thing like you're meeting lots of different people
A	mm networking's great
B	networking yeah understanding their like it was kind of really er it was inspiring you get lots of work experience
A	mm
B	erm and it felt kind of cool
A	yeah
B	and then
A	it's just nice to be in that environment isn't it? knowing that you're one with God
B	yeah yeah
A	without trying to feel personal like pride and all that
B	yeah yeah
A	just knowing you're in that
B	yeah that's true
A	it's cool
B	erm it was cool then doing something straight afterwards as well like going into work or
A	yeah
B	like going into a place where you can try and put it into practice
A	yeah cos you
B	mm
B	yeah I think so
A	yeah
B	or like
A	I think main the main thing that I've learnt this year is like from reading like the Celebration of Discipline and stuff like that is like
B	yeah
A	self like looking after yourself is really important like erm
B	oh okay yeah
A	half the time you look over it quite quickly and think oh okay I've gotta do this I've gotta do that but to take time out and say right actually I've gotta live live in this way
B	mm
A	I've gotta do things not cos I have to but it's the best way of living for us
B	yeah
A	I think that's been the main if I could say er the one thing that I've done and learnt well it would be yeah to
A	get stuck into the right things
B	yeah
A	in terms of spending time with others as well as reading studying
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah cos you've gotta have a good balance else you tire yourself out you get frustrated with others
B	mm
A	you get put down by your work and stuff like that do you know what I mean?
B	yeah yeah
A	but yeah if you take time out you can actually reflect on a few different things that you wouldn't necessarily think of
B	yeah that's true
B	yeah take time out
A	but yeah I think as well
B	mm
B	yeah
A	so just to have a year where you say actually
B	yeah
A	but at the same time it's been really really nice seeing the youth grow in different ways in the church
B	yeah
A	so like
B	yeah
A	the main one for me has been incredible this year
B	yeah
A	and
B	okay
A	watching him pray for others at
B	yeah yeah
A	mainly praying but in other ways as well with what he's come up with
B	mm that's cool
A	so yeah it's it's always encouraging when you know that stuff like that can happen
B	that's
A	if you allow it to happen and you give them opportunities
B	so would he've done stuff like that before?
A	he would've got there I'm sure but
B	okay
A	it's been nice to actually say
B	jump start yeah
A	come on cos like yeah I've pushed him in ways that he probably wouldn't've thought I would've as well as pushed him in ways that he probably wouldn't want me to've pushed him at
A	but now I'm sure he's fine with it
B	yeah
A	cos like yeah just the way
B	he plays keys as well doesn't he?
A	he does he's done that a few times
B	mm that's cool
A	at the front which has been cool
B	that's cool
A	yeah he's really coming along
B	it's kind of interesting how you how you teach the things you were saying about like the finding the right way to live
A	yeah
B	how you teach that to people I think is a really interesting question dilemma isn't it?
A	okay yeah absolutely
B	how would you
A	erm
B	do you think you need to teach people? or is it something they find on their own?
A	so some things that
A	so sometimes I hear a talk on Monday and I think
A	or you might wanna change it completely but most of the time I've just kept it fairly simple
B	okay
A	so just like what's the main points here?
B	yeah
A	okay how are we gonna branch out from that?
B	okay
A	so one thing that I've especially done for
A	so I
B	that's cool
A	but it's based around a Bible story or a Bible passage or something that
B	yeah that's a good shout
A	reflects from it so then they're learning the Bible they're reading out the Bible but they're not just doing that and thinking okay so that's what it meant back then they're
B	yeah
A	so I'll show you some examples
B	yeah
A	so like erm I'll go round the circle saying guys we're gonna pray now it'll be good for us all to pray and if you can't think of anything then look at the board cos they've just put all the answers there themselves
A	so eventually that starts making them think again so that
B	yeah
A	cos like sometimes it's hard to know what to teach what to say
B	mm
A	if they're gonna enjoy it but at the same time sometimes if you do that all the time they're just gonna get ah it's we know what we've gotta do it's gonna be boring
B	mm
A	so the one thing that I need er
B	okay
A	so like maybe it could be go outside and play a game and how that can link in or stuff I don't know but
B	yeah
A	it'd just be a good idea to mix it up a bit
B	mate that sounds incredible sounds like
A	but it's been good
B	sounds like erm you've nailed a lot in the last year
A	yeah it's been cool to just been given time to do stuff so like
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and like just opening up and having them work in front of me and stuff like that like it's stuff that is fairly simple and anyone can do it but it's just
A	just thinking okay so
B	yeah
A	but yeah it's been nice just to have opportunity cos
A	sort of thing he won't say you've gotta do this for next week cos er obviously it's quite hard if you've gotta think of something in a week to say
A	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah yeah
A	but it's been nice to
B	yeah that's
A	cos obviously it opens it up a bit then doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well it sounds like that's
A	it's been nice
A	we have quite a lot of support around us as well like so far we've had so many more drummers turn up which has been great just
B	yeah
A	so it just means that I don't have to do so much
B	yeah
A	of the things that I have to do sort of thing cos no one else will do them
B	okay yeah
A	so it means that I've got more flexibility again to say oh I can do this now
B	yeah
A	or do you know what I mean?
B	so like drumming and
A	yeah I haven't done a I haven't drummed on Sunday mornings except from
B	oh okay
A	which has been cool cos obviously I don't have to go out then to the groups cos they're not on
B	oh yeah yeah
A	so I do three times then I can go out and once I can stay in the service which is really nice as well as I
B	okay yeah yeah
A	so that's been good but it's also been nice just to spend some time thinking
B	yeah yeah
A	is there anything I can add? or even if it's just to
B	yeah that's cool
A	it's just more flexible isn't it?
B	yeah
A	but it's cool
B	mate they're gonna miss you when you go probably
A	well yeah I think yes and no cos like
A	you say that but then that means that again it's just opening it up for someone else to do
B	yeah
A	cos like
B	yeah
A	they don't have to
B	yeah
A	it's all about next generation
B	it is oh mate that's cool
A	yeah it's good to see you though
B	I definitely haven't been as involved in the in the
B	saunter on stage
A	that's good though
B	ding ding ding ding
A	worship stuff? er or is it just turn up on the day
B	erm you do er you do it once a month
A	okay
B	you join and band there's a band every week different band every week
A	mm
B	and you join
A	is that good or bad do you reckon? or would you prefer it if it was the same band?
B	erm it's good because lots of people get to play
A	mm
B	everyone gets to play in
B	not everyone gets to but that's like a motto
A	yeah
B	erm but it's bad for
A	you don't really gel
B	the reason that you don't really gel and er good for variety I guess
A	mm
B	but the ideal would be just like paid musicians who maybe that's an ideal but or at least paid quality
A	mm
B	but I dunno what the ideal is it's kinda cool
A	yeah
B	but yeah that's been
A	have you led a few?
A	have they been good?
B	yeah yeah
A	cos you you you're a guy who doesn't like too much change when it comes to when you play
B	yeah
A	you like knowing your set list fairly far in advance and
B	yeah like
A	if you can change it you can
B	yeah
A	but you know to you like to know what you've got don't you?
B	yeah I like the biggest thing I've learnt with that is because the band's like completely new band last week
B	or the week before I was
A	mm
B	so I learnt about how to be really direct with what you want
A	mm
B	and er to practise really thoroughly and like spell out to people what what you need them to do
A	mm
B	cos
B	whereas like if I play with you that's good
A	mm
B	but we can bounce off ideas off each other and like
A	yeah
B	say erm yeah it's something I like
A	yeah
B	I don't know what you do if you
B	just play
A	yeah
B	go yeah
A	what would you say like the the if you could
B	ah that's a great question
A	okay
B	ah so many
A	yeah
B	do you know? I think the biggest one would be ah there's not one it's it's two there's two
A	okay that's cool
B	erm one is worship and worship worship
A	yeah
B	erm and worship like when you're on your own erm worship when someone else is leading who you want to be
A	mm
B	you want to be up there worship them just worship all the time and the second one is listen erm
A	mm
B	and if if you're in the band listening should be should be
A	mm
B	erm and also when you're worship leading you're listening to God and you're listening to what you are playing you're listening to what everyone else is doing
B	trying to tune into what everyone else is doing so develop your worshipping and develop your listening I would say
A	that's cool
B	er what would you say? would you add anything?
A	I think you've done well there I think like you said worship worship worship in terms of
B	education education education
B	I always think of
A	yeah erm in terms of yeah what you've got to do some people try and listen to too much music and get it wrong that way cos they're
B	mm
A	too busy trying to think oh I've gotta play these amazing chords and do it in a certain way
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but they forget they're actually on a stage cos it's worshiping God they're trying to worship songs
B	yeah yeah
A	so I'd say don't spend too much time listening to music try and play it just without anything
B	okay try and get some okay yeah yeah
A	just just go for it that way
A	but in terms of listening I think that's really important cos
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	mm
A	cos that's really how I learnt how to play drums I think
A	just from hearing other people drumming and then that
B	yeah
A	taught me how to play
B	yeah yeah that's very good that's how I learnt tennis as well not listening to people drumming
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	that would be genius
A	that would be quite clever
A	some I had I learnt how to play
A	I self-taught myself how to play
A	but then erm after a while I had a few lessons but that was reading music it wasn't how to play
B	okay yeah
A	erm but yeah that was probably for about a year maybe
B	cos now you're really good really good
A	yeah but I've forgotten all of what I learnt in my lessons in terms of how to read sheet music
A	if you put a sheet in front of me I'd be able to figure it out roughly but I wouldn't
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't
B	yeah well you've got all the rudiments so
A	mm
B	that's the main thing
A	but I find people who learn how to play drums through lessons in terms of music aren't always the best at playing
B	okay yeah
A	cos they're too busy caught up in reading that they're actually in rhythm they're not always self-aware as well
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	especially in a church cos sometimes if you try and play it to a track that's actually not gonna work cos you need to thin it out cos
B	yeah yeah
A	you've gotta almost like act
B	yeah yeah you gotta anticipate like the closing of a of a section or like
A	yeah
B	the building of a section before it even happens so that you're ready for it
A	yeah
B	and to keep it in time it's a really tricky instrument to play whereas acoustic guitar you can just like fumble around a little bit and
B	yeah
A	do you play bar chords? or do you play?
B	I can play bar chords
A	what do you prefer playing?
B	I prefer playing
A	do you play D chords? D shaped chords? or C? or E?
B	oh erm favourite is like G shapes
A	G shapes
B	so you have a lot going on in the bass but also
A	that's pretty good
B	like that yeah
A	I haven't done too much of it but it always sound great
B	little shuffles mm does sound really cool
A	yeah
B	we like Snarky Puppy at the moment
A	right
B	have you heard of Snarky Puppy?
A	I've heard it mentioned but I don't think I've heard much of their music
B	okay kind of urban jazz
B	it's very cool
A	that's quite cool to try and have a little
B	yeah
A	have you heard erm Deep Cries Out Reggae?
B	no
A	so basically William Matthews is on stage and he starts erm Deep Cries Out Reggae
B	oh right
A	and then he just turns it into the actual normal version
B	that is so cool
A	it's pretty cool yeah you gotta hear it
B	those guys practise so much don't they?
A	yeah they must I reckon they probably practise twice a week
B	yeah oh yeah
A	at least
B	at least
A	for a Sunday
B	yeah crazy musicians and then they're probably like working in music the whole week
A	yeah
B	yeah what legends
A	yeah be er quite a cool life thought wouldn't it? spending that much time together and just
A	that would be pretty cool I would like that
B	yeah
A	but again sometimes you can get stuck in a bubble which isn't helpful
B	no
A	I think like yeah going to Kenya and stuff like that that would be a good eye opener
B	mm yeah
A	how's your sister getting on? cos that's a completely different
B	yeah she's doing well yeah
A	is she enjoying it?
B	think so we skyped er yesterday
A	mm
B	she's doing yeah she seems to be doing well got got a big tan
A	yeah?
B	yeah
B	when are you going to Kenya?
A	erm that'll be
A	erm I'm going first of erm July
B	okay
B	nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	have to see how it goes but that can yeah can go one of two ways you can either really love it or you get a bit disheartened from it can't you? so yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't think I'll get disheartened but again you can never tell until you're there
B	yeah it's true I've never understood the erm the bubble theory actually
A	no?
B	I've never understood that erm partly
A	mm
B	you can never be outside of a bubble if it's if we say that so say you hang out with er you're the band
A	mm
B	er say you're working for Bethel
A	yeah
B	or
A	mm
B	and you're like playing drums and then you you help you're like er mentoring a few kids and they're like doing stuff at youth services erm and you spend all your time with them er there's no reason to say that that's not the real world
A	yeah
B	because someone who is in the real world so for example they work at Tesco's
A	mm
B	because that to us seems like it's the real world cos it's outside our bubble
A	yeah
B	they are in a system of bubbles themselves aren't they?
A	yeah absolutely
B	erm and their idea of the real world exists outside of their spheres so I I can understand where it where it comes from but and we do need to be connected with different I guess it's just saying that we need to be connected with different like ways of people different types of people isn't it?
A	yeah
B	like so we don't lose focus is it?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	it is kind of good it's kind of a noble idea actually
A	yeah
B	but yeah I don't think we should be afraid of
B	yeah
A	and saying how it's so important that we need so many different people erm just in terms of instead of obviously saying we need we need a vicar we need a worship leader cos obviously that's fairly self-explanatory
B	yeah
A	but saying how we need people who work in the church
B	okay yeah
A	as well as we need people working in the church for the outside church as well as people who come to the church for the outside church
B	yeah
A	and people come
B	okay yeah yeah
A	like the four different spheres
B	oh that's cool
A	and how obviously if you don't have outreach no one's gonna be new is gonna be coming in if you don't have in-reach then you're too busy being out there and your church isn't surviving
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah that's kinda cool
A	yeah that's quite fun trying to figure out wait hang on where are we?
A	are we in the church? out the church?
A	coming to the church? going out the church?
B	are you where do you where do you fit yourself?
B	yeah
A	but as well as that I'm outside the church cos I'm working as a chef
B	yeah yeah
A	but yeah I don't know I haven't done much outreach this year in terms of
B	yeah
A	inviting people but at the same time I'm with youth all the time who bring new mates so I'm
B	yeah
A	in that chain but not really outreaching
B	yeah do many of the kids bring
A	we've had so many new faces in the last year
B	oh okay
A	yeah it has grown but again that's not always a good thing cos if it's growing too much you're not actually investing in the newcomers as well as the old-comers
A	cos you're too busy trying to say hello to everyone remember people's names
B	yeah
A	and try and make them fit in that some of the old people might not feel quite so involved
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	yeah it's really hard been trying to figure out how I should be in how it is
B	mm
A	and what you need to be doing
B	strategy
A	yeah
B	just remember people's names
A	yeah that's the hardest bit sometimes
A	cos obviously if someone comes in
B	they expect you to as well yeah
A	yeah it's hard
A	especially as there's less of leaders so obviously it's easier to remember names
B	yeah
A	they remember you oh hi
A	hello mate how are you?
B	mindful of actually saying mate all the time
A	yeah
B	cos like the
A	mm
B	you would say mate to them
B	and they would get really annoyed cos they didn't know
A	mm
B	if they knew
A	yeah
B	yeah I'm going to
