C	that you've made up
C	it's not really appropriate though is it?
C	oh so they've been doing some in-depth analysis
B	what was it?
C	some sort of
A	a Jeep?
C	I don't know what it was
C	cos it must have been very fast jet engine something
A	a Jeep?
C	but they often no
C	on the water because it would sink wouldn't it?
A	a Jeep on wheels
C	right cos Jeeps don't have wheels normally?
C	I think they do
B	I believe in the Loch Ness
C	well the thing is I just think it's a bit sad to be analysing it like that
B	yeah
C	cos the story has been there for a long time it's sort of a mythical thing isn't it? so it's a bit boring for everyone to go oh no we haven't found it because maybe there was a monster and maybe he went away or maybe he died
B	or maybe to protect them
C	yeah
A	what?
A	if it was on the
A	and T Rex would go
A	or even better hotdog shop with a big hotdog on top

C	I can't hear what you're saying
C	can you can you speak up please?
C	what are you saying?
C	mm
A	erm from other dinosaurs that wanted to stop on them
C	well not dinosaurs
C	cos this is when people were around
A	and then
A	the T Rex would go to a hotdog shop
A	and see a giant
C	I'm just trying to see if I can find a a news article about it I don't think I can
A	and then
B	about what?
A	he would
C	about the Loch Ness
A	try to pick it up pick it up drop it and go no erm there's a
C	thank you
C	I I can't hear what you're saying thank you
A	so I
C	no no just can you just speak please? can you just speak nicely? thank you so it's found the monster remains in Loch Ness that's the only thing it's found is this one from when it was filming
B	is there a picture of it?
C	there is a picture of erm
A	a Loch Ness?
C	the film
B	okay
C	I think erm or there was when I looked before
A	did the Loch Ness monster walk on land?
B	kind of
C	well has it? have you ever seen it?
A	yeah
C	have you?
B	in the Scooby Doo film we saw it in a Scooby Doo film
A	was it? have you?
B	it was a cartoon one
C	that's the photograph
C	of it of of them
B	I can't really I can't
C	no it's not like a detailed image it's sort of just what they can see
C	but
C	oh yeah
C	very different
A	but on this side
C	I I don't think
C	oh my god
C	but yes so you think the Loch Ness looks good the model?
B	well
A	I don't really I think the Loch Ness is cool
C	mm
B	we've got mythal ones we've got a mythical creature saint George as a dragon
C	yes
B	Wales has a mythical
C	oh really?
B	yeah
C	okay
C	mm
B	which a girl made friends and then they all
C	ah that is nice
B	and
C	uhu
B	some people who saw him then they went ah it's the dragon and they ran away and told fake stories
C	mm
B	but the girl she found out the dragon was actually very upset
B	cos he had no friends
C	oh yeah
B	so he helped him get
C	good I'm just gonna pause it here so I can get ready for work
B	cool
