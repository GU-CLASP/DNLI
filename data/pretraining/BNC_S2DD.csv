A	have you checked that out already?
B	I've done one sheet already and
A	I can smell the truffles from here
C	you should do a couple a day to keep up with it
B	yeah I know I need to do some more
C	I can't smell them
A	mm okay
C	maybe you can smell other people's food
B	probably
C	I'm really hungry
D	are you?
C	mm are you not?
D	no I'm not really hungry
C	mm
A	I'm sure that some will come won't it? I should imagine
C	don't know it doesn't look like it
D	oh
B	sorry is that do you mean I have to fill the sheet in with like who's speaking is that the sheet I have to fill out?
C	yeah the one that says like speaker one who speaks first
B	yeah
C	who speaks second and then you have to list all the topics that are covered as well
B	yeah
A	so what you really should do is when you do a recording
C	it's easiest to just do it as you do it
A	you should have a little note pad beside you to make a note cos otherwise from ones we've done three or four days ago will you remember without listening to the damn thing?
D	well there's only us there
A	yeah but what are the subject
D	oh you have to write the topic?
C	you have to
A	yeah
C	write the subjects down so like what we've been talking about
A	so actually I think you need to have a little notepad and get a bit organised
B	okay
A	I don't have a notepad
C	can note it in your phone can't you in notes?
B	haven't got my phone on me

C	mm
D	erm it looked a bit like well it was quite big wasn't it? and there were
C	I think one was spaghetti mum or was that tagliatelle?
D	tagliatelle and he just knotted it didn't he and put it in the dish like tied it in a
C	yeah you know like you by tagliatelle in dried balls?
D	mm
C	it was like that
B	got a funny story
D	help yourself
B	can't remember what
C	you help yourself to this
B	I was I think I I was making some kind of pasta I can't remember what and erm I bought a mum had bought me that tagliatelle from like Tesco
C	dried stuff?
B	and I took yeah I took it out the packet and put it on my table and miss was coming down round and writing down
D	what you'd done
B	what everything was
A	no I
C	go on
D	sorry
B	and
C	did you tell you her you'd made your own pasta?
B	I was like I had this this
C	no wonder it was dried in
B	no but I took it out the packet
C	yeah but
D	if it's dried you'd be able to tell the difference
C	if it's dried you wouldn't make the fresh pasta and then dry it if you've
B	well
C	made your own pasta
B	well
B	yeah
A	a bit sharpish
C	was she not laughing at you?
B	no
C	Mrs
A	well when you were making blooming
B	fruit salad
A	cut bread and stuff
B	yeah
A	make toast
C	make a fruit salad
B	we had to make a fruit salad
D	did you hear Miss er Mrs
C	oh this time?
D	mm
C	oh she must have turned fifty-five
D	she must have and she's not hanging about
C	mm
D	uhu
C	mm
B	one lad we were making like rock cakes and this one lad put the entire jar of Nutella in and it just turned into like a gooey mess
B	but like oh it was so funny
D	yeah but they should instruct you shouldn't they?
C	food was the
D	yeah but do you know what we used to do?
C	it's impossible
D	she'd demonstrate one week and the next week you'd do it
C	mm to be fair that's what Mrs
A	then what do you do in an exam for food tech?
B	oh god it's like
C	food groups
B	yeah a lot it's common sense
C	nutrition
B	well then there's like spazzy questions or like like micronutrients were on this year which
A	mm
B	that's a bit of a disadvantage then
C	it's okay mum you've not had any of this
D	ah well
C	have some beef
D	is it fatty?
C	mm yeah there's quite a bit of fat that piece is okay
D	mm you could have just done with more meat
C	mm
B	can you
C	and then it kind of mixed in a bit
C	yeah
D	but I've never tasted gnocchi that I've enjoyed before and that's nice
C	see that's very nice but it's so rich
D	mm
C	go on
D	mm
C	yeah
D	I think you'd have to cos you'd have to er get a razor blade or something to slice those wouldn't you?
C	uhu
D	unless you used like a peeler
C	a don't I don't think a peeler would do it that thin
B	unless you like grate it over the top you know like a cheese grater?
C	mm
D	you you'd lose it though wouldn't you?
C	I'm sure you can buy at home like a truffle
D	slicer
C	slicer
B	even so just go on Amazon there'll be one on there won't there?
C	red sky at night
B	I wonder if that's actually true that theory or whether it just er
D	it is
C	I think it is
A	mm
C	yeah
D	it works
A	find out in the morning
B	that and cows lying down I don't think that's true

D	it's a bad name it's a

D	these birds are so high aren't they?
C	mm really high I don't know would they be this high if these wasn't here to
D	I don't know I guess so
C	I don't think they would fly this high like if it was just from them there would they?
B	be a waste of
A	but swallows do kind of fly like that really yeah
B	yeah but it would be a waste of energy wouldn't it? there's no reason to get this
A	they're probably catching flies aren't they?
C	flies? is that what they eat?
B	dunno they must have to eat a lot of flies to
D	well they'll just be here for the summer won't they?
C	yeah
D	why where do they go in summer?
C	I thought they went to Africa
A	they do
B	do they go to Africa?
D	they do South Africa
A	you used to see them in Nigeria yeah
A	yeah
C	go to South
D	they do the same thing
A	they do the same place
C	why aren't they all in South Africa now then?
D	mm
A	yeah
D	cos the winters are milder there
C	yeah
C	yeah
C	guys we've been doing this wrong for thousands of years this year we're not going to
D	I wonder what that
C	daddy sparrow coming home to family sparrow
C	guys we're not going to South Africa this year
B	pack your bags we're leaving
A	I've checked it on I've checked it on Tripadvisor
D	they've tried to work it out what it isn't this homing device
C	mm
D	oh that sunset's perfect
C	mm
D	isn't it?
C	it's making your face orange
A	give it a try
B	god I should be a photographer

A	oh well
B	digging your daggers
B	I should be a photographer
A	well take it up as a hobby mate yeah why not?
B	no that's boring
A	as with all these things you've got to invest a lot of time and effort into getting good at it really
C	which you haven't
A	which I haven't no I don't pretend otherwise
B	thank you
D	thank you it would be a good thing to do wouldn't it?

C	be nice if we had a hot tub at
B	mm
C	that would be nice wouldn't it? I bet the stars are nice I haven't looked at them
D	I did last night
C	were they good?
D	well it was clear last night cos you know it was a bit colder last night
C	yeah it was very cold last night
D	erm
B	the thing is there's space for it isn't there to put it in that like the
C	there is space for it
B	part
C	but I guess it's cost isn't it for a holiday rental
D	and managing it as well
C	yeah
D	I suppose a pool's enough as well
C	a pool's expensive enough to keep on top of isn't it?
D	yeah
A	better get in it and use it then hadn't you?
D	we have
C	well we have done you haven't
A	I know I saw someone being thrown in and screaming
D	all three of us have been in
B	you've just slept
C	there's only you who hasn't been in
A	I only had a quick
B	a quick nap
A	a quick nap I dunno it's fine
C	a quick nap you were sleeping for about two hours
A	don't know if was that long but whatever ooh
D	oh
C	ooh
A	crap that was close
C	he scraped himself then didn't he?
B	no
D	I thought he got
A	almost
D	the wheel
C	that was so close I would not risk that
D	I would not wouldn't wanna bring my
C	no
D	BMW up there
C	don't risk
A	you're always
C	your Audi
A	he obviously knows what he's doing
C	you wouldn't have made that on
D	mm I wouldn't have tried
C	mm
D	he's obviously used to doing it
C	mm yours was very nice I'd have had a smaller amount with some veg
A	did you bring the did you bring the anti-bite cream I'm just getting bitten
C	you have it's in the erm not not not the repellent you've brought the itchy stuff
B	I'm just thinking right what what's the difference between Ebola mosquito and a normal mosquito? is it just a different like species of mosquito?
C	I think some of them carry the disease like they have the infection themselves
A	yeah yeah they have
B	so could we have Ebola mosquitoes over here?
C	oh he's
D	they said they were coming to Europe
C	is er is Ebola carried by carried by mosquitos?
B	it is isn't it?
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	could we not
A	erm well no not quite actually
C	is there somewhere that we couldn't like completely like eradicate mosquitos?
B	yeah
A	I think there is
C	like having mass gassing?
B	can I just say this right
A	yeah
B	if
C	but would we not kill like everything else?
B	this was in my biology exam so I'm gonna have a little
C	go on
B	basically
A	right go on you first
B	they're doing it at the moment where you can genetically modify mosquitoes
C	okay so that the
B	so that like the
C	mm
B	die basically and they can't reproduce and you you can control the amount of
D	oh
B	like mosquitoes
C	that's clever
A	or become
B	so
A	infertile
D	so when the
B	yeah
D	when the when they hatch
B	so when
D	they won't live?
C	they're infertile yeah
B	yeah so that means if you release those into the wild they're gonna breed pass on those genes
C	and then it spreads in the populous
B	yeah
D	oh
C	and so they're doing that?
B	that's what that's what my biology exam said whether it's true or not I don't know
A	yes
C	are they starting to do that?
A	yes
C	so how quickly would that start to work?
B	well that was one of the questions it was like why is this why is this bad? and I said cos it could lead to eradication of mosquitoes cos if you can't
C	I don't think mosquitoes do add anything to the food chain though do they? I suppose they
B	I wouldn't like stuff like frogs and
C	frogs things like that they might eat them but
C	yeah bit more then yeah it's alright
A	you have to be careful kind of don't you altering the biodiversity
C	really?
A	yeah
C	what I wouldn't have thought a mosquito net would work as a fishing net cos they're not very strong it's just like
A	I know but
C	film
D	what's that
C	Bill Gates bought millions of mosquito nets took them to Africa and they've used them as fishing nets
D	take a duck to water
A	yeah not everywhere but yeah
C	isn't it take a horse to water?
