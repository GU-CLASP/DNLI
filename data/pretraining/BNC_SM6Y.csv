A	it's the sort of thing that would happen when you're growing up
B	no
A	because it's half a hour in the kitchen so it's quite
B	ah yes
B	mm it's very nice
A	so I'll have to see this one
B	mm
B	mm I like lamb
A	oh good mm
B	mm that's good
C	was that taped on the way round?
B	no
C	round the block
B	no
C	no
B	be too noisy I think
C	ah
A	mm
B	what time's
A	I don't know yet
B	but in the afternoon?
A	yes
B	mm
A	waited until the children's bedtime say seven
B	oh right
A	and then set off
B	mm
A	mm yes
B	problem starting I mean
A	he er there's a lot of erm warning lights coming up he got back from the
B	oh right
B	mm yeah
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	unlucky
A	with it still on finance mm
B	probably shouldn't mention grandpa's car to him then
A	no I won't cos I'll be careful on that one
C	mm
B	yes that will cause a problem that's why I wanted to pay for it though cos of things like that
C	yeah
A	yes
C	yeah
A	yes
C	that's true
B	that will cause upset
C	mm
A	yes
B	I know but still
A	yes
C	mm
B	there's no point causing
A	no
C	no no
B	problems if there's no need especially if it's there there's no reason for him to know it's not like it's here on the drive and
C	no no that's erm yeah
B	mm lovely meat
A	oh good
B	I sent you the the link to this project as well
C	thank you
A	oh thank you mm
B	yeah it's just the first time it was a bit of a hassle
B	but then
B	once you've got that sorted
A	yes
B	it's very simple
A	yes
B	I like the fat on the lamb
A	mm it's nice isn't it?
B	mm
A	when it's cooked mm
B	mm
A	or otherwise you like a certain amount of fat
B	mm
A	to to give it the flavour
B	less fat mm
A	and I don't think they're the same
B	no
A	not not a sausage
B	that's good you're cooking even if you're not going to eat the fat it's good to leave the fat on isn't it? cos it keeps it moist
A	yeah yes that's true
A	yes
B	mm
A	because when we're on the cruise if you order
B	can't you tell them?
A	yeah I try tried so I said medium and it still er sort of came back the second time and it was still red
B	mm
A	and I just can't I could eat steak like that but I can't eat lamb
B	but just say well done
A	so well I think the
B	mm
A	to say so it's better
B	ah right
A	but obviously that's how they do it in higher circles
B	mm yeah
C	and beef I think as well don't they?
B	yes beef
A	well yes
B	often looks like that
C	right mm
A	yeah I don't mind I like beef red
B	mm
A	as long as it's not absolutely raw
B	mm
A	but erm
B	it's funny isn't it? erm with white meat you can't do that
C	mm
A	yes
B	mm it varies quite a lot
B	mm
A	hit and miss usually it's not
B	mm yes it is
C	mm yeah I I'm not so keen
A	but you don't mind them?
C	no I'm not so keen oh well yes
A	oh er you're not?
C	well this was erm thighs but no bones
B	I think thighs are some of the best bits to cook with cos there's a lot of meat on them
C	mm
A	well I don't mind them
B	but they don't dry out as much as the breast
C	no
A	no
B	breast's quite difficult to cook because it dries out easily
A	yeah
B	cos it's got no fat on it and
A	yes
B	actually the thighs cook quite nicely
A	have you had my recipe for the breast stuffed with brie and mushrooms and lemon?
B	oh yes that's nice
A	yeah that's a good one and then wrapped in bacon
B	mm
A	and that's a lovely sort of filling meal and it does keep moist
B	yes
A	well I did quite a nice recipe one day with those thighs I just made it up and put them in with
B	oh right
A	it was good
B	mm
A	seriously er seriously thinking of having your housewarming party then?
B	mm
B	yeah it's a nice way to see people at New Year
A	well people'll be very pleased
B	if they don't come that's fine isn't it?
A	I think you'll find they will
B	mm
A	and actually you're in a good position aren't you? for inviting
B	yeah
A	cos you know it's not as far down for him
B	no that's true
B	mm
A	and it'll be novel won't it? with bring your own cutlery crockery
B	yes
B	er I'll have some paper plates
A	mm oh right
B	it's cheap but yes the chairs
A	mm
B	mm mm
C	I think there's two in the garage
A	yes
C	those two
B	is that with chickpeas dad?
C	erm that sort of thing yeah
B	oh
A	yes
B	mm
A	mm
B	but I prefer this one
C	mm
A	this lamb's a terrible price in the supermarket
B	really? how funny
A	absolutely ridiculous
B	in the Middle East it's cheap
A	oh yes and I can't understand it
A	cos we've got plenty of sheep you'd think
C	mm
B	mm
A	so why is it?
A	why is it so dear?
B	yes
A	oh there's a question for you
B	that's madness isn't it?
A	it is they showed you in the paper didn't they?
B	absolute madness mm
A	the prices they were getting's terrible
B	yeah
B	and they've got it again haven't they? recently just a few days ago
A	mm
C	yes some supermarkets pay them less than
A	and they've got to sort it out cos the farmers were taking their cows into the supermarket
B	I saw that
A	weren't they?
C	mm
A	and then throwing milk off the shelves onto the floor and
B	yes but Morrisons have just brought out a new brand of milk
A	ah
B	where they guarantee a certain price to the
A	oh right that's good
B	and they print it on the bottle
A	oh yes
B	mm
A	but it's er it seems very wrong doesn't it?
B	it's all very well having free markets but I mean
C	I know
B	market left here
A	mm
B	no well they're not going to are they?
A	no
B	not profitable
A	and all that hard work
B	mm
B	big overheads as well
C	yeah
B	you know if the tractor breaks down
A	oh yes
C	yeah
B	not exactly optional
A	mm
C	no
A	yes
C	thank you
B	perhaps
A	mm yes yes perhaps so and his son-in-law just found er the
B	mm
A	I think erm if we did this with dad and I it'd just be
B	grandpa
A	no that's fine cos grandpa don't know if you've noticed can't have any silence
B	yes that's true
A	well yes
B	so what state do you think the house will be in?
A	erm
B	mm
A	because they've got another month haven't they? and that's quite a while
B	I think the roof will be done
A	you do?
B	cos they won't be able to get it finished otherwise
A	right
B	cos they can't work on the inside until the roof's on
A	mm
B	I think it takes a while
A	yes yes perhaps it's yes you'd think the longest thing was putting the
B	mm
A	well we don't know how long they've been doing it do we?
B	no
A	yes
B	I don't know and then they've got to fit the kitchen
A	mm
B	I suppose you can do that in a day though can't you? probably
A	er yes
B	no cos they're all just prefabs I suppose aren't they? like IKEA furniture
A	yes
B	screw it together
A	mm when people know what they're doing it's no time at all
B	yes
A	clear the carpets? oh no
B	no but all of them
A	yeah they're so quick
B	oh really?
A	but you see people who know their trade it's
B	mm
A	boom boom boom finish so it won't it'll probably take
B	oh okay
A	a morning
B	ah right okay oh that's good
A	for the carpets yeah
B	oh dear we're gonna have a fight now
A	yes erm
B	I'll take your plate because I need to wash my fingers
A	well I'd quite like yoghurt
B	okay you have yoghurt
C	then you have yoghurt
A	oh can I?
C	yeah
A	cos after the lamb it's nice to have
C	I'll cut those in half
A	yeah oh that's good you've got cream
C	could you pass the plate please? thank you
A	I've got
B	what am I having?
C	well er mum
B	ah
A	wonder what happens with this if some people have
C	erm
B	mm?
C	if you'd like it heated
B	thank you no that's fine thank you
C	do you want it in the microwave
A	would you like some cream?
B	erm yes please
A	that's good that
B	oh really? oh I see
A	mm
B	I haven't met
A	yes it will
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
C	didn't she win a holiday in France?
B	yes
A	yes
B	that was good
A	and then you know winning things and then selling them if she doesn't want them on Ebay
B	mm that's good
A	yes
B	really? oh that's good
A	yes well the equivalent of
B	mm
A	it's nice for
B	mm so he's going to be there over Christmas?
A	yes
B	mm be nice with her family?
A	erm I don't think all the time
B	ah
B	sensible
A	yes
B	oh really?
B	mm
A	and then there were all the brothers and sisters so it seemed fine they went off sort of together with a few of them
B	that's nice
B	mm
A	with the parents
A	it was it was a little bit difficult to get used to it but that just happens doesn't it?
B	yes
A	perhaps a few days is enough in that situation
B	mm
C	mm
A	oh good
B	oh yes
A	if you think you'll use it
B	yes I would use it
A	I think if I don't think I'm gonna use it
B	okay well I'll have it on long loan then if that's okay?
A	oh yeah that's fine erm
B	yes
A	of yoghurt you've made for the next lot but the thing is if there's only one person eating them
B	okay I'll have it every day
A	yes so you'd have to buy it as a probably a pot of natural yoghurt every time you wanted to start it up again but that's not really a problem is it?
B	no
B	mm
A	yes I don't know if it would last six days either what you've made so you'd need two a day
A	I think you might have to
B	which is okay actually if you're going to have it instead of pudding
A	yes and then you could have a gap couldn't you? and then make the next lot if you didn't want to keep it up
C	mm
B	yeah
A	well you could try it anyway
B	or anyone who visits
B	yeah
C	no it's in a separate container
B	the other thing is you can cook with yoghurt can't you if you're making curry?
C	mm
A	yes yes er yes you can
C	mm
B	or salads
A	yes
B	in the Middle East they make
C	yeah
B	a cucumber salad with yoghurt
A	yes and then somebody
B	ah yes I've done that actually yes
B	it you can only tell the difference when it's not mixed in like in
A	okay
B	you know tortillas
C	yeah
B	when you do
A	yeah
B	Mexican
A	mm
B	you can tell but if it's
A	mm
B	cooked
B	into the sauce there's no way you can tell I think
A	mm
B	well I
A	yes
C	no it's milk isn't it?
B	yes and it's a bit sour
C	yeah
B	isn't it? yoghurt?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and I've probably if I look in my drawer got the booklet to go with the yoghurt maker
B	ah thank you
A	so I'm going to be spring cleaning the kitchen because it's meant to be done in the summer
B	yes
A	so you know I'll probably be turning out a few things so I'll you know
B	thank you that'll be nice
A	yes
C	er would you like coffee before we go?
B	yes that would be nice thank you
A	mm
B	mm
A	cos
B	I've got two of mine so that's alright
A	two of yours?
B	yes
B	ah okay
A	put them
B	well I'll take a few then
A	yes
B	thank you
A	and what else? and there's storage containers a tea caddy
B	I think I have to yes
B	oh dear look on your Ipad
A	yes
B	actually mum it's got a really nice feature in Google I found by chance if you write define
A	yeah
B	and then the word it comes up with the dictionary entries
A	oh does it? that's good
B	Google's got all these clever things built in
A	ah well yes
B	erm I don't know why they don't tell you ever
A	mm
B	it's got a calculator built in there too
A	mm
B	if you write two add two it tells you the answer
A	well that's good
B	well I suppose that's not that useful for two add two
A	oh maybe I've seen that one
A	that was a phone actually
B	you know sometimes you get recipes that say Fahrenheit and you don't know what it is
A	yes
B	you can put that in
B	ah
A	put currency converter and things come up
B	ah right
A	different sites
B	mm
A	no
B	these are actually built into Google like
A	into Google yes
B	so you don't even have to go anywhere
A	oh well that's
B	it's clever
A	well it is clever mm yeah I don't well I mean
B	mm
A	I
B	no
A	cos I don't it isn't me really I don't know
B	no that's fine
A	er we are different our generation definitely
B	yeah
A	cos I don't want everybody to read what I'm going to say
B	no
A	not many people have have they?
B	mm
A	and even
B	no I noticed that
A	and
B	yeah
A	so perhaps not just us that don't like it I think perhaps we're not
B	yeah
A	and that that's about it sort of thing we don't have to discuss it at length I prefer that
B	yeah
A	so it's helpful to
B	mm
A	not to actually talk about something that's so major
B	yes well someone must've said something to that effect
A	mm
B	cos of that post
A	yes that's interesting we wonder who it is
B	it wasn't me
A	and when I was awake one night I was thinking who was it? was it
B	do you think
A	I don't think
B	no so I don't think he would do that
A	no
B	because of that
A	yeah
A	well I don't think
B	ah right
A	but will
B	I don't think he would
A	yeah I don't think he would to be honest
B	I don't think he writes enough normally does he?
B	and when he does write it's just a few lines usually
A	I don't know
B	I don't think he writes
A	loads
B	really long emails anyway
A	no
B	it could be someone in Australia couldn't it?
A	yes it could so well say it is
B	I think it's I think it's more likely to be someone there
A	yes
A	mm
B	oh but she wouldn't say that
A	I don't think she would
B	no she wouldn't
A	but did you
B	no
A	I didn't tell you this story
B	yes
A	and then and really wasn't
B	mm
A	and said he thought erm she thought that she should stop having these sort of conversations because it wasn't helping the family that's what she said but she must've meant dad and I I think
B	yeah
A	erm but
B	but I wonder if that's true
A	but she said don't
B	cos I mean a professional psychiatrist wouldn't get upset would they?
A	well she was annoyed with
B	yes but I don't think a psychiatrist if they're any good
A	counsellor I dunno
B	counsellor
A	mm
B	would be that you know forthright so I wonder if that's
A	well they try and
B	yes
B	yeah
A	cos the lady said oh
B	mm
A	and so
B	oh dear
B	mm yes
B	yes it is difficult
A	yes that's all you can say it's difficult she's trying to help
B	yes
A	mm
B	there's two sides to every story
A	exactly
B	mm
A	yes
B	anyway it's okay now I think isn't it?
A	yes it's fine yes
B	mm
A	it's very difficult because it can erm
B	yeah
B	oh right that's a shame
B	yes
A	do you think?
B	yes and it's not always helpful to go back over the past I think
A	well no
B	when I do this counselling course
A	yes
B	I'm quite interested in that
A	mm
B	there's different approaches to counselling
A	mm
B	and I think I would rather work with what you have now
A	mm
B	and move forward
A	yes
B	rather than always go back and look for the why
A	mm
B	perhaps it doesn't really matter the why a lot of the time just how can you improve the situation going forward?
A	yes I think it's changing isn't it some of it?
B	mm
A	cos it has been blame and it's all from childhood whatever you are now
B	yes
A	but I think it is changing a little bit
B	I think it's changing
A	yeah
B	there's a lot about erm being grateful at the moment erm
A	being grateful
B	sort of a bit old-fashioned
A	oh that's er oh that's good yeah yeah
B	almost like counting your blessings except it doesn't have a religious
A	yeah yeah
B	slant but that's very in at the moment
A	yeah oh right
B	but that's right isn't it? I mean if you've got your
A	yeah
B	physical health
A	yes
B	I mean anyone who hasn't will tell you you know health is wealth
A	mm yes
B	so you know you should be grateful for that
A	mm
A	yes
B	the thing is here we don't really know what it's like to not have you know to have real poverty do we?
A	no no we don't
B	no one does here
A	no
B	I mean even the worst cases
A	mm
B	you don't hear of people starving to death or
A	no
B	not getting treated for something treatable there is poverty but it's not
A	mm
B	the same level that you see in other countries
A	perhaps they've gone too much on digging out the past and perhaps you need to because the person it comes to the person's mind so you've got to deal with it can't just shut it down
B	yes you can't ignore it
A	but you've gotta work through it and do some appreciation of the other things at the same time or soon afterwards
B	yes
A	but not go on and on and on
B	and getting there there's a new thing about mindfulness
A	yes
B	getting you to focus on the now
A	yes
B	so that you can get on with your life
A	yes
B	cos if you're constantly looking back
A	yes
B	you can't do anything can you?
A	no no that's right
B	mm
A	yes
B	no that's not natural
A	yeah
B	especially and especially if something like grief
A	yeah
B	like when someone's died
A	yeah
B	I think you actually do need time to grieve don't you?
A	well they say if you don't it'll hit you later
B	yes I think that's probably worse
A	yeah if you don't deal with it
B	yes
A	mm
B	you've got to I mean it's normal to be sad
A	yeah
B	then you wonder about doctors prescribing anti-depressants
A	mm
B	when actually it's it's quite natural if say your husband's died that
A	yes
B	after thirty years together you're going to be depressed not for a month
A	mm
B	but you're going to be depressed for a couple of years but that's normal
A	yes if you're not so depressed that you can't carry on with your life sort of thing
B	yeah I mean obviously if you're suicidal then
A	yeah
B	you know they have to step in but I think that is quite normal
A	yes
B	to not want to do anything for
A	no
B	erm a while
A	you see the old Victorian
B	yes they still do in the Middle East
A	and shut themselves off oh yeah and you
B	yes in the Middle East
A	yeah
B	Muslim women automatically by law get er well it's well over a month
A	oh right
B	off if their partner dies their husband
A	yes well it's sort of sensible yeah
B	dies and they're supposed to shut themselves away
A	yes
B	just be in the house they can have visitors
A	mm
B	as many visitors as they want but they're not supposed to go out
A	ah right
B	for like forty days or something
A	yes
B	and then after that time it's okay they can go on as normal they can get married again if they want
A	oh right okay
B	but they're supposed to have that time to
A	yes
B	to grieve and the other reason
A	mm
B	so it was a way of making sure that she wasn't pregnant before she remarried
A	ah
B	so they'd know whose child it was
A	mm
B	quite interesting
A	there's a lady over the road who's seventy I was walking round one day and she started to chat and she'd been having some sort of counselling and there was things that had come back to her at that age about her childhood which had
B	cor
A	upset her a lot
B	yeah
A	which is interesting you know that the father was very very strict and
B	mm yeah
A	yeah so it's interesting so
B	which lady across the road?
A	erm the one that lives in the house where the front garden's been taken by the next house
B	oh
A	the farmers
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so er it's difficult isn't it?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	that's right it might be worse
A	mm
B	going through all that again
A	but we also probably all need help and they say we all need a counsellor to help us that we learn to deal with things better
B	yeah
B	mm
A	one extreme or the other couldn't it?
B	that's true
B	shall we retire?
A	yeah
B	time to go
A	erm in seventeen minutes
B	seventeen minutes?
A	yes
B	oh that's quite soon
A	throw that because it's getting stale now water
B	what's that?
A	the water
B	oh
C	yep
B	good thank you for the coffee
C	okay
