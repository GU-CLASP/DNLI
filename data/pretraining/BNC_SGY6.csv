B	looking like the picture
A	oh
B	do you have sugar?
A	yes I do erm brown or white?
B	er what do they say? doesn't say
B	probably brown would be nicer if it's not like very coarse like demerara or something
A	I don't know er it's in the cupboard in front of you
B	oh yeah they're both up there actually
A	yeah
A	oh this smells weird rapeseed oil erm don't take take the whole bag out cos
A	broke the bag
B	no problem
A	woah that smells different I've never used rapeseed oil before
B	haven't you?
A	no is it in Indian cooking quite a lot?
B	erm I dunno like actually I use it for most
A	do you? why?
B	yeah you're not meant to cook with olive oil cos it once you cook with it it does something I dunno can't remember what
B	it becomes not as healthy and not as nice
A	okay
B	Jamie Oliver always uses rapeseed oil as well
A	does he?
B	yeah
A	I've got one of Jamie Oliver's cookbooks but because it's
A	in order to make any of these things you need all of these different kitchen gadgets so I kind of said
B	yeah
A	ah
B	but it's meant to be pretty healthy but you know
A	yeah
B	it's not expensive as well it's a lot cheaper than olive oil
A	mm is it?
B	yeah
A	oh maybe I'll give it a go
A	oh are they?
B	yeah
A	I don't really I only really use olive oil I'm glad you brought your own oil cos I haven't got any at the moment
A	actually I've got sunflower oil and that's it
B	yeah that I mean that tastes different but this doesn't really erm
A	I wish I could find another
B	stealing what?
A	like the spatulas
A	erm they're probably in his toy box actually
B	does he sweep up?
A	well kind of
A	he takes it up into the living room and just wanders round with it
A	it's about three times the size of him
B	ah
A	so what are you doing tomorrow night then? is it an extension of
A	oh gosh
B	and then
A	what? an adult
B	yeah
A	ah

B	erm they're going to like their friend's party
A	oh okay
B	erm
A	erm you could use

B	oh no it's fine erm heat er it would be easier with the spatula that
A	mm mm
B	garlic chilli cumin black pepper and salt do you have black pepper?
A	yeah it's probably in the cupboard here
A	yeah
B	okay
A	is it easy to? is her book easy to follow?
B	yeah
A	mm does she use erm quite straightforward words? or does she use like Jamie Oliver type words
B	no quite well his words are quite straightforward isn't it?
A	well no well no how er yes however I really hate it because
B	mm
A	and he came up with the word smashed potatoes I was like no it's wrong
A	but Jamie Oliver said yeah I don't care
A	so that er that annoyed me quite a lot
B	that's funny my German grandma used to call them smashed potatoes
A	well we
B	get Smash yeah
A	do you?
B	yeah
A	I'm sure you do
B	yeah yeah
B	not now he's a health freak
B	yeah I'm gonna have to keep it a secret yeah
A	yeah proper secret
A	have you?
A	yeah are you not eating chocolate?

A	no
B	yeah that won't be good yeah
A	you asked them if they could tell you what? at the twelve-week scan?
B	yeah and they said
B	they'd only be seventy percent sure
A	wow
B	so they wouldn't
A	wow
B	cos er they didn't they didn't do it
A	you're gonna find out yeah?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they didn't

A	yeah that's alright
A	so wonder if
B	oh yeah it's now it's due earlier but it's still you know
A	yeah I know but you know still might

B	just put that back on the heat
A	it's still very hot
