B	oh right yeah it's
C	I wouldn't I wouldn't know what day it was at all cos I don't
B	well I was
C	oh there's a computer I suppose
B	I was quite stuck the other day
A	yeah
B	cos I've got this really cheap electric clock
C	yeah
B	you know the sort of thing you get for a fiver and I've had it since I lived at
C	yeah
B	and er
A	mm?
C	yeah
B	yes please
C	what do you want a ginger one?
B	mm maybe yeah
B	but this clock it's it's been going really weird and I keep thinking oh it's them cheap batteries I keep buying and
C	oh right
B	so
B	I mean I could be sort of like
C	well we're the same that's the only clock well we've got a little tiny clock
B	mm
C	in the front front room haven't we?
A	mm
C	but we got this clock here
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and we still go by that clock
A	mm
C	we never change it from British Summer Time to
B	mm
C	Greenwich
A	no point
C	no there's no point in jumping up there and
A	really
C	climbing up there and changing it so
B	that's right I
C	does it?
A	oh right
C	oh well ours must have made up then
B	ours is okay yeah it they in the
C	no it didn't no
B	well yours is automatic is it?
C	mm
B	really? good grief
C	it just go on
B	ours you have to do push your button and all this sort of thing
A	oh right
B	and I can never be bothered
A	well the Subaru
C	I know
A	went but it took a long time to do it I don't know why
C	yeah
A	mm
C	all this modern cars
B	perhaps it's set to European time cos they don't change the clocks the same time as we do do they?
C	no they no that's true
B	you know there's always like a fortnight
A	yeah
B	so we're
C	yeah they're different aren't they yeah
B	mm
A	so does someone
C	no that's all automatic now
B	what?
C	that go by there's a place in
A	oh
A	did you? oh
C	mm
A	I know they change car clocks or
A	Greenwich Mean Time
C	that's all done by satellite isn't it?
B	is your clock connected to the satellite then?
C	yeah it must be because
B	have you got a satnav built in?
C	no
A	no
C	that just change it weird I don't know how
B	I can't see that myself
A	that's what I mean how do they do it?
C	no
B	I mean they can do it on a
C	mm
B	and that's why it wouldn't
A	mm
B	you know if they sort of change the day
C	well I suppose yeah
B	when you change the clocks it wouldn't catch up
C	yeah
B	but I mean they used to have watches what would do that didn't they?
C	they did yeah
B	they
C	yeah
B	you know change er you know change with the er
A	yeah
B	automatically change cos they'd
C	yeah
A	and then what happens in a leap year?
B	well that's all calculated in you see
A	it's all sorted oh
B	yeah that's why these watches are very expensive
A	mm
A	yeah
C	in that er I'll tell you where I saw
A	just stick them just turn it
B	saw that that place
A	was it?
B	he said we're in

B	yeah but that was a lot of white collar student stuff weren't it?
C	yeah
B	yeah he's in the sticky place ain't he?

C	yeah
B	right? for poor people
C	yeah
B	which means that the well-off people have got finance it
C	got pay for it yeah
B	but they are apoplectic
C	yeah

C	yeah that'll be that'll be
B	that'll be out
C	yeah
B	why should our tax
C	yeah
B	you know I mean that's their attitude
C	that is innit yeah
B	what was it when erm
C	oh yeah? was it that that one that vicar was it? cos he took time off and
B	no it weren't him no this was but anyway this bloke he was in
C	yeah
B	it was like
A	mm

A	yeah
B	you know cos
B	tramps you know but
C	they they'd rather
A	yeah
C	see them die though wouldn't they?
B	they would they would
C	that's
B	I think this was in New York
C	the American state of mind that is
B	yeah that's right but they wouldn't pay anything to look after them
C	no
A	mm
C	er I did used to see that what's that Labour er
B	Ed Miliband
C	Miliband it just did you see him?
B	mm
C	giving
B	oh right I saw the picture yeah
C	giving to the poor?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	tuppence he give like that
A	he had to go back give him a fiver didn't he?
C	yeah
A	and someone gave him cos he didn't have any money with him
C	no that's right he went
B	yeah well they go out without money
C	well of course they go
B	well the thing is I mean he was
A	mm
B	on a hiding to nothing weren't he?
C	of course he was
B	if he'd just walked past and said
A	yeah
B	look you know he wouldn't even give anyone a you know
A	that's right
C	but I mean
B	anyone a running
C	they they still done him over didn't they?
B	yeah of course they did
C	they still done him over
A	yeah
C	and that won't don't matter what politician that would have been they'd have done him over I mean it could have been
A	mm
C	anybody really can't it? they'd have still done him over
B	but it's erm
C	did he? oh I didn't see that
B	for some reason
C	in the debate?
B	he was in a debate with Myleene Klass right?
C	oh right
A	why?
C	what's this
B	well I dunno why they were in the same thing
C	was that one she advertise
B	but
C	for Littlewoods don't she?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	god
B	well but she's also very right wing
A	yeah
C	yes she is she is
B	and she
C	oh right
B	and like she is like a
C	multibillionaire
B	yeah she is well not multi
B	multimillion
C	multimillion yeah
A	mm
B	and she is very erudite
C	yes
B	and she was
C	he couldn't cope with it
B	he couldn't cope with it
C	oh wow
B	but she was sort of saying things about
B	you know and you're forcing them out you know and they wouldn't be able to pay it and stuff like that and she was saying oh and some of these areas in London even a garage is worth you know two million quid you know
A	mm
B	you know what I mean?
C	well
B	but I mean
A	yeah
B	all her arguments were like
C	well it
B	really
A	mm
B	superficial
C	well of course they were
B	and ignorant
C	yeah
B	and
C	he didn't point it out to her at all
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	people who you know are pensioners who are living in a house worth two million quid you know they can they don't have to pay that until after they die
C	yeah
B	and they it gets into the probate
C	that's right yeah
B	you know or he didn't say that
C	oh yes that's a yeah I know what
B	er something release equity
C	that's it equity release
A	oh yeah
B	it's in their interest to get equity release
A	yeah
C	that's right
B	and live off that money
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and because when they die forty percent of the profit of the house
C	that's right
B	are going
A	mm
C	going to the insurance company or
B	death duties you know
C	yeah but the rest will go to the people who have
B	yeah I know
C	give
B	but I mean like say you're living in a two million pound house
C	yeah
B	you know
C	yeah yeah
B	so that means one point six million is gonna be charged as on death duties at forty percent
C	yeah
B	so automatically your estate is gonna lose
A	mm
B	forty percent of one point six million
C	yeah
A	it's a lot yeah
B	well it's a lot of money whereas
A	mm
B	you know if you had
C	yeah
B	like on a two million pound house you could have a half million pound equity release
C	yeah
B	that's tax free cash in your pocket
C	that's right
A	right
C	yeah
B	which you could be living off
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	when you die you know this two million pound house less the half a million equity release less a couple of hundred thousand
C	that's it yeah
A	mm
B	is still
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you're still but you're paying you know once you take the four hundred thousand off it you're only being taxed on six hundred thousand
C	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	so you know
C	yeah
B	you know you're you're you know what you've been living off basically is what you would have had to give the taxman anyway
C	that's right we had a friend
A	mm
C	well or if
A	yeah that was
C	she er she did that with her house
B	mm
A	yeah
C	because she didn't want to leave it to her son
B	mm
C	cos he was wicked bloke
C	you know
B	yeah that's
C	so she did this
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and she lived in her shed
C	didn't she?
A	mm
C	literally lived in her shed
A	and she and then she's moved into the house
C	and then
A	didn't she?
C	the house again yeah
A	mm
C	but er
B	but why did she live in a shed?
A	so
C	oh cos she's rented that one out
B	oh she rented it out
A	yeah
C	she rented that out and lived in a shed
B	yeah
A	so that was her income
C	so she was getting an income as well
B	mm
A	mm
C	as
B	yeah
C	I mean there's this was several years ago now so the equity release wouldn't have been
B	but
C	yeah
B	and I think she got thirty thousand equity release
C	yeah
B	and with that money she paid off all her debts I mean she had a mortgage of ten thousand
C	yeah
B	so she paid that off
A	yeah
B	and she's
C	yeah
B	you know?
A	oh
B	and so she was living there she wasn't paying the mortgage any more had a nice sunroom and then when she sold it
A	yeah
B	in value
C	the equity release was
B	that the charges that they'd charged cos the they don't you know they just roll up the charges don't they?
C	that's right yeah
A	oh
B	I mean the charges they charged her
A	right
B	you know
A	so it worked out
B	a hundred thousand out of the deal you know
C	yeah yeah
B	you know
A	it worked out really well
B	yeah
A	yeah you you tend to think that it's
B	yeah
A	a bit of a
C	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	you'll lose lots of money out of it
B	well what they do they charge you
C	yeah
B	right? cos basically they got sold the money on it I mean they're getting a good deal out of it right
C	well of course they are yeah
A	mm
B	because
C	isn't it the government that er
B	no no there's different companies who do it
C	oh right yeah
B	and what they do they depending on how old you are
C	yeah
B	and erm
C	yeah
B	cos they've gotta work out that say
C	mm
B	you know say a house like mine would probably be worth about a hundred and sixty thousand
C	yeah
B	right? so they'd give me
A	mm
B	fifty-five thousand quid
C	yeah
B	and they wouldn't charge me any interest
C	no
B	but it'd be charged up combined on the fifty thousand so the next year
C	so it would be
B	you owe them fifty-five thousand or whatever and then the year after that it's fifty-eight thousand
C	I see
B	then the year after that it's sixty thousand and the next year after that it's sixty-five thousand you know and it just keeps going
C	oh right
B	until you die really
C	yeah
B	but I mean they charge something like six and a half percent
C	yeah
B	annually
C	which is dead cheap really innit?
B	which you know
A	mm
B	yeah I mean
C	yeah
B	and then you'd die and then they'd get all your house right?
C	they do yeah yeah
B	because that covered because they allow the
C	yeah of course they are yeah
B	you know they got first choice of the money
C	yeah
B	but on the other hand you know if your house is going up in value every year
C	yeah
B	you know er you know I mean recently
A	mm
C	they've been going up over five percent a year so
C	so I hear yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	and yet
A	mm
C	hasn't sold his yet has he?
B	you know
C	no
B	like a two bedroomed flat
C	that'll cost a bomb wouldn't it?
B	a maisonette
C	yeah
B	when they bought it two years ago
A	yeah
C	and now?
B	the people downstairs
C	double I would think
B	they've got an identical
C	wow
A	oh right
C	we did
A	yeah
C	that was
B	I mean that is a lot of money innit for a two bed
A	yeah
B	I mean these are not big places I mean
A	yeah
B	I should think
C	yeah
B	er wall unit
C	yeah
B	another little bedroom at the front
A	mm
B	and the sort of
C	yeah
B	and it is in a
C	well that's good if they've got a garden
A	yeah yeah
B	it was it is in a really posh area
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	well that's worth a lot of money the garden in London innit?
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
C	outside space in London is
B	yeah
C	worth a bomb
A	yeah
C	I mean they had something er that was probably er Homes Under the Hammer again that we watched
A	I think probably we watch that on most days
C	because we do like Homes Under the Hammer
B	mm
C	and er
B	mm
A	mm
C	you know just to go out on the balcony was worth an enormous amount of money compared with a house that was just
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	cos that's what lots of them places are
B	yeah
C	they look like
B	well you see a lot some people
A	mm
B	don't wanna go home do they?
C	no no they don't
B	I mean there's a lot of people who are quite happy to live in a in a block of flats
C	that's right yeah
B	you know with no garden nothing and in fact I was like that for years you know I mean
C	yeah
B	I didn't didn't need a garden didn't want
C	no
B	a garden
C	no
B	just something else to have to look after
C	it is isn't it yeah
B	when you're young and busy
C	well yes
A	yeah
B	but once you have kids
C	yeah
B	you suddenly realise that a garden is very desirable
A	it's everything innit?
B	innit?
C	it is yeah
A	just to be outside without going somewhere
B	and when you've got a kid running around in the house all day
A	yeah
B	can't get out cor
C	before we built this place
A	well
C	we had the we had the field didn't we? we we'd bought the field we used to bring them down there
B	mm
C	you know although we had a lovely garden at
B	yeah
A	but we lived in a flat
C	oh yeah
B	in
C	that just had a
B	yeah
C	balcony didn't it?
B	and erm
C	yeah
A	whether it's raining or not you have to go out somewhere to the shops or
B	well down

B	like I had
C	yeah
A	that's where we used to go a lot

C	you can't play out there you can't play with the kids could you?
A	no no it was only
B	I can't think of anywhere else nearby
A	only a bit of walk space
C	no

C	come from
B	where you
A	mm
C	yeah
B	oh it's on that bit
A	all the way
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	all the way up and
B	well no that that it's pointless people who are actually protesting cos they'll be built
C	well
B	I mean it's like people
C	apparently
B	apparently protested about the school being developed and things
C	well that's right yeah
B	they'll be built you've got no chance
C	but apparently er
B	mm
C	and this
B	yeah
C	and er
B	yeah no doubt
C	well of course it is yeah
B	so apart from the people who think that'll spoil their village
C	well
B	you know?
A	well they're er
B	I mean it might bring new blood into the village
C	well they're they're
A	but they reckon the schools can't cope you see the schools can't cope doctors can't cope it's quite big now this village
C	yeah
B	I know but I mean what'll happen is
A	this
B	is that they'll just
A	yeah
B	add another doctor to the surgery and
A	mm
B	Portakabins in with the school I mean
C	well they they were
B	it ain't hard is it?
C	they were then saying that the doctor's surgery should have been
B	mm
C	and they missed out on it they reckon
B	yeah well it's like all these things and I mean they they just
C	but
A	yeah
B	that's right
A	mm
C	I mean we had lots of people
B	mm
C	lots of people for it but lots of people against it but we got permission
B	I bet you the majority of people who
C	yeah that's right yeah
B	you know?
C	yeah
B	it's it's a sort
C	that is yes
B	you know I mean at one time
C	not in my backyard
B	at one time
C	that was weren't it yeah
B	about
A	mm
B	you know webbed
C	yeah
B	webbed feet and inbreeding and
C	yeah that's right
B	you know?
C	yeah
C	it was
B	and when you went around the villages it was obvious there was a lot of inbreeding going on
C	well of course it was
B	you know cos it was like
A	mm
B	you know
A	but didn't that happen all over the place
B	yeah and
C	yes it is
B	because it's one of the few places which is you know sort of
C	yeah it is yeah
B	and the economic output and it's because of all the people that import people they're like who's to say
C	well
B	or whatever
C	well yeah
B	they're all strangers to Norfolk but they're all building up the the economy
C	well this is right I mean they brought in if the Polish left
B	no no they're too lazy to compete
C	I mean
B	you know I mean
A	yeah
B	has gone on in
C	yeah
B	twenty years
C	yeah yeah
B	I mean there are thousands of houses been built in
C	there have
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and er they're gonna build even more and I'm thinking
C	yeah
B	well you know why not if you're gonna build a town build a town you know?
C	yeah
B	and they say about the you know I knew that they used to say about the schools and the surgeries couldn't cope
C	yeah
B	to cope I mean they might have had a few years
C	yeah
B	it's a bit like the dentist you know and things like that
C	that's right
B	they might have had a few years where there's problems but they managed to sort it out in the end
C	well
A	mm
C	have got big problems haven't they with the doctors
B	have they?
C	surgeries yeah haven't they?
A	apparently yeah
C	apparently they
A	mm
C	they can't get
A	yeah
C	can't get any
B	well they're only a problem if you're ill
C	that is true
A	yeah
B	mm well I mean you look at
C	oh god
B	you keep reading about that
A	yeah
C	yeah that's in a story state innit?
B	it is
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but I mean that must have been going like that for years
C	yeah
B	and it's a bit like the
C	well
B	that is
C	ever since
B	been running on
C	yes
B	red emergency
C	yes but ever ever since er they were made a what they call it? a
B	what hospital trust?
C	trust
B	yeah
C	quite a long while ago now weren't it and ever since then everything been going downhill
B	of course they have
C	well of course they are
B	who don't really know what they're talk about it
C	yeah
B	it's all
C	yeah
B	whereas they don't look at the future where it's gonna cost ten times as much in the future
C	yeah
B	because they're pulling the money away and when they built
C	they did
B	from the old one
C	they did
B	cos they said oh you don't need them any more
C	cos we have a big turnover we we
B	yeah
C	stick them in and
B	but you know that since then the population
C	well yeah
B	of the catchment area is going up leaps and bounds all the time
C	it is isn't it yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and they think of well you know you hear these stories about putting these old folks into a taxi
C	yeah
B	you'll be alright
C	yeah
B	I dunno how true they are but
C	well
B	I expect some of it is true somewhere in Britain and
C	well you got you get get this er this old girl just the other day that was the same thing she got sent home in the middle of the night didn't have a key to get in
B	yeah
C	I mean
B	well
C	we need the bed now off you go
A	mm
B	it's a rum do cos I mean like the
C	well there are our
B	the
C	cos
B	are still in a terrible state
C	yeah
B	and they say that
C	yeah
B	where they had like people waiting for twelve hours in a blooming ambulance cos they
C	yeah
B	couldn't get them in through the doors
C	that's right yeah
B	and all the ambulance were blocked up so if they had any new emergencies they couldn't
C	they couldn't go to it no
B	or just drop them on the floor and go
C	yeah yeah
B	but I mean they said oh they'd sorted that all out but then you read that it's still the same
C	it's still the same yeah yeah
B	but they still
C	oh yeah
B	hundreds of thousands of pounds to keep the blooming
A	mm
B	air ambulance in the air
C	yeah that's right
B	I forget how much a day that costs but
C	that costs thousands don't it? yeah
B	well I I think it's something like
C	well er
B	well no when they had one helicopter that was sixteen thousand a day
C	yeah
B	and now they've got two so it's thirty odd thousand a day
C	that is isn't it yeah
B	they're paying
C	yeah
B	for two helicopters who
A	yeah
B	when you see it they're very
C	that's right yeah
B	they're sort of picking up people who
A	mm
B	seem bad but when they get there I mean my niece had a car accident
C	yeah
B	and they had to call the blooming air ambulance for it
C	wow
B	you know you think and there was nothing wrong with her
C	no
B	she'd just sort of like
C	and I suppose they strapped her all up then
B	shift her all er in the air ambulance
C	and there was nothing wrong with her?
B	nothing wrong with her
A	yeah
C	yeah weird innit I mean and yet you get people like the St John's ambulance doing it for nothing don't you?
B	that's right yeah
C	I mean we I watched a programme the other day about that footballer who collapsed with a heart attack
B	yeah
C	on on the on the pitch
A	that's right
C	and St John's ambulance were there keeping him
B	mm
C	and er and er and they saved his life
B	but at one time
C	yeah
B	you know round round the pitch and you'd for the St John's ambulance
C	yeah
B	and like the the people would chuck money you know coins
C	that's right they didn't they?
B	into the but they'd be holding the blanket
A	yeah
B	and chuck coins into the blanket
A	oh
C	yeah
B	well you never see I dunno
C	you never see it any more
B	perhaps the perhaps the clubs give them money
C	perhaps they do yeah
B	I mean they've got a millions haven't they
A	yeah
B	some of these clubs
C	of course they have yeah
B	round the
C	great big blanket and just
A	mm
C	people used to chuck
A	did they?
C	half crowns and two bob bits you couldn't chuck a pound in it cos that used to float
B	not that you would anyway
B	mostly pennies
C	yeah
C	mostly pennies mostly pennies
B	that's right yeah
C	that big weren't they?
B	mm
B	yeah
C	now you've got tuppences and pennies are all steel now
B	that's right
C	and just covered in copper plate
B	that's right and if you collect them
C	with a magnet
B	a magnet
C	yeah
B	and the other ones are worth more than
C	more than the face value
A	mm
B	more than the face value in copper
B	yeah it's strange that when when I was read these stories of when
C	yeah
B	over to
C	yeah
B	apparently like in Germany
C	yeah that's right
B	with this the five pfennig and the ten pfennig I think was they were all sort of
C	yeah
B	and they collect them and they had so many it was
C	what?
B	it's funny isn't it ay?
A	yeah
B	you'd think they'd be going to dig them out now
C	yeah
B	and sort of like use them you'd think they must have some sort of value
A	mm
C	well yeah
A	mm
C	from from pounds shillings and pence to
B	decimal
C	decimal
B	well the whole what was it pre
C	pre twenty-one twenty-one and
B	pre twenty-one yeah
C	yeah pre twenty-one were were nineteen twenty-one were silver
B	I don't think they were solid silver were they?
C	they were solid silver
B	cos there was some if you were you had to
C	well some nickel silver
B	and then if you went back a bit further they were
C	yeah
B	solid silver
C	well we got
A	mm
C	a pound
B	well I can imagine
C	a pound each for our half-crown coins
B	yeah
C	so that they must have been silver
B	mm
C	because we wouldn't get we wouldn't have got a pound each for them would we?
A	no
C	that's when we bought the land
B	yeah
C	a pound each
A	mm
C	we had eight didn't we?
A	mm
C	and went through all our money
B	yeah
C	and finding all this
A	yeah
B	it's funny old
C	are they?
B	yeah cos on all yeah I
C	I've still got threepenny bits
B	I've still got a load of pennies and ha'pennies and
C	and a silver five P
A	oh
C	silver silver threepenny bit
B	silver threepenny bit
C	yeah
B	but the er
C	yeah they you do yeah
A	oh
B	and used to get like nothing for them you know
C	yeah
B	a fiver or something like that
C	that's it yeah
B	but nowadays
C	well
B	they go for like a hundred quite for
A	right
B	a mixed jumble of old coins
C	coins yeah
A	mm
C	people going through their
B	well that's right trying to find the odd one
A	mm
C	yeah
B	stamps as well
A	mm yeah
B	at one time years ago you'd get nothing for a stamp album
C	that's right well
B	you used but now people
C	now you and I had a load of
A	yeah
C	stamp albums my brother had a fantastic
A	I've still got mine
C	you've still got yours yeah
A	better get that
C	but I remember when we when er when there were pounds shillings and pence
C	because there was only so many cos it was Edward the
B	I dunno whatever
C	oh yeah the
B	there was one particular penny where there was
A	yeah
B	only six made or something like that
C	that's it yeah
A	mm
C	nineteen thirty-seven threepenny bit was made he abdicated didn't he
B	yeah
C	and they started making them and had to stop but that lots of them got er put through and er if you have one of them you're worth thousands
C	then
A	yeah
B	yeah well there was a lot of things that
A	always the dream isn't it?
B	a lot of ifs ain't there?
A	yeah
C	yeah a lot a lot of ifs and buts I mean
A	yeah
C	crikey
A	mm
C	the things we could have done if we'd have did them
B	yeah
C	then if
A	if you'd got
B	and it's like that
C	where we would have been now
B	it's like that woman that Irish woman who won the lottery
C	she spent
B	last week
C	oh oh I don't know about that
B	no not the Scottish one this Irish woman she won last week
B	and she said oh yeah I'm gonna
A	ah
B	er falling down and all the money's been taken away
A	mm
B	from them and stuff like that
C	oh right
A	yeah
B	and she said she she says well it's better to have a youth centre rather than hanging around on the streets you know they've got nowhere to go and she's gonna spend all her
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	won't take long does it?
B	on on er
A	that's the sort of thing I would like to do
C	well I mean
B	yeah
C	er in
A	mm
C	they had
A	if it ever happened
C	they had a youth centre up at the church rooms
B	mm
C	the kids used to
B	mm
A	just standing outside they just stand outside and sit on the pavement
C	or just stand outside
B	yeah but the thing is
A	they didn't have to pay then
B	the thing is a lot of
C	yeah
B	and you know why?
C	because the vicar come in and say goodnight
A	cos they didn't wanna have to pay
B	what?
A	cos they didn't have to pay then
B	yeah but I mean like if
A	oh religious
B	worthy individuals
C	that's right yeah
A	yeah mm
B	who try and organising and they're the big I am and stuff like that
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and the kids just aren't interested
C	no they're not
A	no
B	whereas
C	well they used to have to pray at our
B	yeah well they aren't gonna do that are they?
C	course they're not
B	no
B	and then you know every now and again they get sort of wrecked don't they?
C	they do yeah
A	yeah
B	and so people say oh well you know we're not having this any more you know we're close it down
A	yeah true
B	if they can't pay a proper attention to it and all this sort of stuff
C	yeah well er our youth centre they used to have er kids from
B	mm
C	and the same
B	yeah
C	you know all that
B	mm
C	haven't they? I mean they they do a youth centre up there and that's been really
B	well you see this is it if they're run by if you can get some
C	yeah
B	to run it
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	you know what I mean?
C	yeah
B	er who
A	mm
B	get people who actually live around
C	yeah
B	in the village to run it
C	that's right yeah
B	and but you've got to find people who
A	mm
B	got the incentive to do it
C	and and
A	well the guy
B	because nowadays you know they could you know with this sort of idea that you know you can't get jobs and you need CVs and you need this that and the other
C	yeah
B	I think that would be a bit a bit of an incentive to you know kids to get involved wouldn't it?
C	that would wouldn't it yeah
B	you know it could look good
C	apparently we've got a very good youth organisation in in
B	mm
C	the kids write
B	yeah
C	bits in the
B	mm
C	you know and and talk
B	well of course
C	no
B	you know I mean people always have been wary of young people
C	well yes
B	but in in in in Germany
C	yeah
B	and usually it was sort of a big old house
C	to the
B	there's no adults
A	yeah
B	involved with it
C	no
B	and they're sort of like adults they're young adults
C	yeah
B	and sort of like they've been there as young kids and
A	mm
B	they've sort of grown and slowly sort of
C	yeah
B	and they used to have a bar and stuff like this as well
C	yeah
B	and er cos you know a certain amount of people were over the age of drinking and
C	yeah
B	well they used to cook meals
C	yeah
B	and they used to
A	yeah
B	have bands in there they used to have sort of table tennis stuff and but they had the main place of bar sort of place
C	yeah
B	was just like a big sort of place with
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and you could either play games or watch telly or whatever you like you know or just sit and chat
A	yeah
B	like every time there'd be like
C	yeah
B	to open it
C	that's right yeah
B	and they would sort of like be running it
C	yeah
B	but you could always get plenty of people to
A	mm
C	well
B	work in them
C	we used to bike from
B	mm
C	club or youth centre because the
B	rubbish
C	pretty rubbish
B	mm
C	and the
B	mm
C	table tennis and all the things that
B	yeah
C	kids do you know and play around and do
B	yeah
C	and then that got spoiled
B	yeah
C	you know when when the when blokes and and the woman who ran it left
B	yeah
C	the church took it over and what do you get? you get oh we must say our prayers thank you for everything you know kids don't want no
B	yeah
C	and that was just it weren't it?
A	yeah
C	I mean how many teenagers want to know about that?
B	no
B	they don't want anyone
C	no no
A	there's a young guy at the back here though isn't it and he's got er
C	oh he's
A	what he calls the
C	brilliant he is
A	but
C	he's kind of religious
A	he's very young
C	yeah but he's he's great
A	but they built they've built a round house now I expect I've told you about that
B	no
A	they've actually built a round house up at
B	okay where have they built it?
A	so
C	just over just
A	over the back there
C	at the back there
A	they still call it the
B	mm
A	their kind of thing and they have
C	yeah
A	music and
C	they have music and
A	and all sorts they're really
C	they have a really good time
A	sounds brilliant
C	and they built these round
B	mm
C	and
A	yeah
C	we climbed up and went in it
A	it was good
C	and that was really well made and that weren't nailed into the tree
B	mm
C	it was all done with cantilevers and stuff
B	yeah
C	you know
B	yeah and this is why they've got to take it down is it?
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	so so now they've
B	oh yeah
A	got a round house anyway
C	they've got a round houses they've built around

C	oh wow
B	and
C	no
B	and she said that
C	yeah
B	or that was the needle was jumping
C	it's yours then
B	which is which?
C	that's yours
B	dunno
C	well I'm sure that was yours cos you cos it had these on
B	and these LPs right
C	yeah
B	they was they had been sold at full price so they were supposed to send them back
C	yeah
B	and er
C	wow
B	which were just like dumped you know
C	yeah
B	another thing she did was she had this er
C	oh right
B	and they'd come round and say it jumps she'd put it on and say mm it sounds alright to me perhaps you'd better look at it
B	but she used to get all these
C	yeah
A	oh you made it
C	yeah
B	and she used to have thousands and thousands of LPs then I used to record them on my reel-to-reel you see
C	I see right
B	but they were all
C	no
B	it was all
C	well we we we got a fantastic
B	cassettes
C	cassettes
B	yeah
C	they hired them out
B	really?
C	for something like
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	one would record
B	mm
C	and we recorded them all
B	yeah
C	we've still got the things here
B	yeah
C	and they're not very good now but I mean
B	no
C	of course tapes actually stretch and you
B	I know yeah and they start
C	and they start going stupid and then they
B	mm
C	copied on tapes
B	but then
C	which is naughty
B	but then there was a where you could go to the library and borrow
C	that's right yeah
B	things and copy them couldn't you?
C	yeah you could yeah
B	you could borrow CDs
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	now they put some kind of er
B	dunno it's hardly worth it is it?
C	no
B	I don't suppose they do it in libraries any more it's too expensive
C	I don't suppose they do yeah yeah
B	and most people download stuff anyway and they say that
C	yeah
B	well you can download any song you like
C	yeah
B	can't you?
C	you can yeah
B	cos it will record anything what's coming over the
C	yeah
B	you know I dunno I should imagine that does it direct so
C	well yeah yeah
B	but I can't be bothered now I got
C	well
B	thousands and thousands of well hundreds and hundreds of songs on the computer I never listen to them
C	well you never listen to them
B	I've got stacks of cassettes
C	yeah
B	I never listen to them
C	that's it just stick on the radio
B	and it comes out with random music
C	yeah
B	and think you'll either like it or you don't
C	yeah there's a a a good show on on erm Radio two er
B	yeah
C	Johnnie Walker does Sounds of the Seventies

C	oh I see yeah
B	and they're all doing like Led Zeppelin Two songs and things like that
C	yeah
B	so I
A	mm
B	turn volume to maximum
B	but I've only listened to it about once or twice
A	mm
B	I mean it's an exceptionally good thing you know and
C	mm yeah
A	oh? yeah
C	like more easy listening than that
C	yeah I know what you mean yeah
B	mm
C	I think it's one of the first five LPs I ever bought was Led Zeppelin Two
B	yeah
B	and that's
A	yeah I think it was the one
B	absolutely brilliant that is I I don't think anything matches it
A	mm
B	that they did you know
C	yeah
B	I mean that every track it's very strange like every track on an LP is good
C	mm mm
B	I mean it's like The Beatles isn't it like every track
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	on The Beatles LPs were good
C	well we were into Pink Floyd at one time we we just love all the
B	yeah
C	Pink Floyd stuff
A	and the
B	I've got several
A	I like The Moody Blues a lot
C	and Moody Blues with
A	yeah
C	that totally different type of music but
B	yeah
C	but The Moody Blues
A	yeah and Yes
C	oh Yes
B	mm
C	they had
A	mm
C	what was his name?
B	Rick Wakeman
C	Rick Wakeman yeah
B	he's an interesting character now when they come on the radio and talking
B	he's really he's really good I really like him
A	mm
C	he er
C	well he did a programme on on on the television
A	that was Grumpy Old Men
C	long hair yeah Grumpy Old Men
B	that's right yeah
A	cor he was grumpy on that one
C	god
B	mm
C	he was he was really grumpy
B	we yeah we saw him once it was at Crystal Palace right?
C	mm
B	and er that when he was really famous and he did this Journey to the Centre of the Earth
C	yeah brilliant
A	mm
B	and he was performing that with his band the Journey to the Centre of the Earth and
A	yeah
B	and it's all like a natural amphitheatre in Crystal Palace with a lake and he was sort of
A	great
B	they were sort of on this
B	sort of stage which is was sort of set
A	lovely
B	overlooking this lake
A	right
B	got to the bit where they er erm
C	oh right yeah
B	cos like they had this lake with the
C	yeah
B	monsters in it
A	oh
B	right? they had these blow-up sort of Loch Ness monster type things
C	did he?
B	except that they weren't quite blown up enough and then sort of like the heads were sort of like
B	not well they kept sort of collapsing and then they had
A	oh right
C	oh I see yeah
B	which was then making the mist you see
A	oh
C	I see yeah
B	for the monsters
A	lovely
B	and
A	oh
B	it was a it was a
A	mm
B	effect if it had worked
C	if it had worked properly yeah
B	but yeah most of the people were sort of interested in seeing that these roadies whether they were going to fall in the water
C	yeah
B	cos
B	sussed it out you know how to get this
C	yeah
B	into the water without having to wade in you know?
C	yeah
B	well it was alright
A	yeah
B	quite interesting
C	yeah I bet it was I bet it was interesting
B	cos that was more or less the same time when Pink Floyd when they were doing all their
A	yeah
B	magic erm
C	Ummagumma and stuff
B	no no no doing the
C	the Dark Side of the Moon yeah
B	and er
A	yeah
B	Wish You Were Here and all these sort of
C	yeah
B	and they had sort of and The Wall
C	yeah
B	I mean they had sort of really
A	mm
B	er effects didn't they?
C	yeah they did yeah
B	but it think it was The Wall we went and saw it er Knebworth
C	did you? yeah
A	oh
B	and they had this
C	yeah
B	and we couldn't be bothered to
C	well of course you were yeah
B	we couldn't be bothered and er there was this erm
C	yeah
B	and when they come to the bit about I'm sure it's smash the wall
C	oh right
A	oh
C	yeah
B	they had this sort of like an aeroplane
C	yeah
B	really slowly
A	yeah
C	did it? yeah
B	cos they had a sort of wall built on the stage
A	mm
C	yeah
B	I'm sure that was what it was
C	oh wow
B	I can remember the aeroplane and remember this
A	yeah
B	you know this scene like
C	we got a load of we got
A	the effects now are brilliant though aren't they? cos
C	yeah er yeah but
A	it's worth going just
C	when you
B	mm
C	think about
A	the lighting and the
C	they had to utilise all that
A	it's amazing isn't it?
C	years ago
B	mm
C	but the effects now
A	what they can do now
C	well yeah
B	but the best way
A	yeah
B	I mean it's sort of like David Bowie started all that didn't he?
C	yeah
B	all these fantastic sets
C	that's right
A	mm
C	he did didn't he?
B	I mean they were so fantastic no one knew what the hell what
B	it was all about you know what is this?
C	no he was he was brilliant or he still is brilliant
B	mm
C	he keeps making a comeback every now and then don't he?
B	yeah
A	mm
C	music changed though but then that's what mum er said
B	yeah exactly
C	yeah and Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby and all them sort of people
B	yeah
C	Ruby Murray and
B	yeah my dad's favourite singers were Vera Lynn and
C	Vera Lynn yeah
B	and Bing Crosby
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
C	same as my mum my mum was always singing Vera Lynn
B	yeah
C	and Gracie Fields funnily enough
B	what Gracie Fields?
C	no my mum
C	and there there was a
B	mm
C	she had a voice sort of that was so shrill and I'm sure the other women along the road
B	well that always used to be like in church weren't it?
C	yeah
B	when you went to church there was always one little old lady who'd singing in a really powerful
C	yes
B	treble
C	that's it yeah
C	yeah
B	warbling treble
C	that's right yeah
B	in spite of what the music called for
C	in spite of what it was yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	and she never kept in time with the
B	that's right yeah yeah yeah
C	and always always a bit ahead
B	I think they must have been tone-deaf or something like that
C	they must have been yeah
B	or or you know so they couldn't really suss out what was going on
C	yeah
C	well it think so
A	yeah you have
B	how'd your dentist
C	I
B	treatment go?
C	I gotta go when are we going?
A	no he's got it wrong I
B	er?
A	I kept saying it wasn't that
B	oh you went the wrong day?
C	no I won't even go cos
A	mm
B	so you haven't been yet?
C	no
B	so you ain't experienced a mouth full of putty
C	no I haven't no
B	a mouth full of bubble gum
C	oh don't I'll gag
B	er?
C	don't it make you gag?
B	well
A	no
B	the thing is
C	yeah
B	but what you had to do is sort of like
C	and relax
B	you know cos sometimes you gag because you're frightened of something going down your throat
C	yeah
B	whereas this you've gotta remember that it's not going anywhere near your throat
C	yeah
B	well you know dentists they're alright they they must er you know you're not the first person been there
C	no it's true
B	and had this
C	yeah mind you we our friend
B	mm
C	didn't he?
A	oh it was the first time he went to the dentist
C	the first time he went
A	then he was he was only tiny but yeah
B	should have stuck the
A	he's just
C	yeah
B	when they're open
A	he he isn't the easiest er
C	he is not the easiest child
A	to to to like have
C	or he wasn't
A	his hair done or anything like that
C	but he was he's a great kid he really is isn't he?
A	yeah
C	but er he didn't he wouldn't let anyone touch him
A	mm didn't want anyone to look in his mouth
B	no
A	so he bit the dentist
B	and the dentist said alright rotten teeth I don't care
C	yeah well that's what I would have said
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know like I say I don't suppose that's the first time that's happened to him
C	no I don't suppose it is
A	no no
B	you'd think they'd have this thing they'd put in there so that they kind of
C	yeah you'd think they're just open wide and stick something in so like
B	mm
C	they can't shut
B	only need to be a bottle cork don't it?
C	course it do yeah
B	mm
A	then I actually thought I I had bitten the dentist when they they used to send you out with gas and air
B	mm
A	and I
C	yeah
A	yeah I had to ask I had to ask
B	mm
A	I had to ask cos I was convinced that was what was going on in my head
C	well
A	you had this horrible gas and it used to come along in a
B	that was a horrible
A	bubble like it and bong burst
B	mm
A	horrible
B	they wouldn't allow it these days
A	they don't do it now do they gas
B	no no cos they need a paid anaesthetist
A	yeah
B	to be on hand
C	yes you do yes
B	cos like
A	dangerous yeah
B	it's so dangerous
C	cor and they'd stick this thing over your face that big rubber like
B	dunno never had gas myself
C	ain't you?
A	didn't you?
B	no
A	oh
C	oh I had
B	weren't allowed that that was for namby-pambies
B	we had that big old needle that
C	did you? that
B	that cast iron needle
C	that stuck into your gum and made your
B	mm
A	mm
C	eyes water
A	I had gas quite a lot
C	god I had gas too
A	till I found out I was allergic to gas anyway so
B	it's amazing how it's come on though dentistry I mean
C	cor that is innit yeah cor
B	I mean sticking needles in your gums now and you can't even feel it
C	no no they're brilliant aren't they?
B	yeah
C	but there was a case on the news the other day about they say a bloke this dentist who had er
B	oh that's right and he never bothered to do
A	yeah
B	did he have HIV? was it him?
C	we don't know yet
B	or was it
B	just that he didn't clean his
C	well that's right yeah
B	I don't think he had it did he?
C	I don't know they
B	no the
C	that was the assumption they gave you on
B	yes
C	on the news
B	yeah
C	but I never did hear the end of the story
B	it was the fact that his instruments weren't
C	weren't clean
B	cleaned proper between patients
C	yeah
B	so if any of the patients had HIV
C	had HIV
B	or anything like that
C	yeah
B	and they never
C	so they they
B	there's yeah
C	they recalled about fifty patients didn't they or something or other?
A	yeah
B	and these people are panicking oh
C	do you know if if
B	I have four children and they're gonna have the blood test to see if they're
C	and now if you have a blood test for HIV or anything that's gotta go down on your insurance policy
C	and then you have to pay an awful lot more
B	I dunno there's a lot of this stuff they keep saying
A	mm
B	this that and the rest but I'm
C	well I mean
B	well they do don't they?
C	another thing the next don't they? you never know what to believe half the time do you?
B	no
C	yeah
B	news you know
C	yeah
B	where they get people worried or what have you
C	yeah you've gotta have people worried haven't you?
B	that's right yeah
B	scare the life out of people
C	you've gotta scare the life out of them
B	just to keep them in
A	oh
B	keep control of them
C	keep control yeah you have
C	I mean it weren't weren't so many years ago when a friend of ours because of the nuclear threat from
A	yeah
A	mm
C	he literally built a shelter
A	yeah
C	in the garden
A	took all the stuff down there all provisions and stuff
C	tins of provisions and water and
B	mm well apparently there's plenty of people like that in America at the moment ain't there?
C	yeah
B	these these people who have sort of got their survival shelters
C	yeah
B	er massive great loaded guns
A	yeah
B	and god knows what
C	well we said to him you know okay you're gonna be shut down here but if
B	that's right and and if you did survive
A	mm
B	what are you gonna do then?
C	yeah and if you did
A	yeah who else is there?
C	I would say
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	in the nuclear waste
C	yeah
A	you are
C	I I've said you know if if that ever did happen I'd go I'd got to the top of the hill and go yeah come on give it to me
B	well that's
C	and that would be it there'd be no
B	that's right
C	in surviving would there?
B	cos in and if there had have been a war
C	no there wouldn't no
C	yeah
B	which wouldn't have left anything alive
C	no it wouldn't no
A	anyway we don't wanna talk about that do we?
B	anyway it might never happen
B	it didn't happen
C	it didn't happen
B	but it might happen now you see they're they keep poking Russia with a stick don't they?
C	they do keep poking Russia don't they?
B	yeah but he had a
C	oh yeah it is that's true
B	you know I mean er
A	mm
B	he's said in in his interview in Germany
C	yeah
B	in an interview in Germany last week
C	yeah yeah it's true
B	and since then they've been pushing all the time
C	yeah
B	and they are now right up against the Russian border
C	yeah
B	you know? cos they
C	yeah
B	you know a sort of a buffer zone
C	yeah
B	that's right
C	where where
B	and now
C	either or each other
B	yeah and it's all because
C	they did didn't they yeah
B	didn't they?
C	yeah yeah
B	and they said oh this is defending against
C	yeah
B	only they're all pointing the wrong way
C	yeah
B	yet when Russia wanted to put missiles in Cuba
C	well yeah oh
B	you know
C	yeah Kennedy went
B	that's right
C	I thought
B	we've come to a nuclear war that was
C	well that was about four hours away weren't it?
B	something like that
C	yeah
A	mm
B	that's right
C	anyhow we ain't got much longer left have we
A	I hope so
B	I don't know
C	yeah it is
B	sixty-seven
C	sixty-
A	seven years' time
C	that is disgusting
B	and like six years' time now
C	that's disgusting
B	it is
A	yeah
C	I mean what
A	that a long time innit?
C	especially when she's sort of like
A	yeah
B	all of the time
C	well I mean
B	and this would be the time where she could really appreciate
C	a little bit of her
A	yeah
B	having a having a sort of basic
C	life yeah
B	basic
A	yeah
B	amount of money coming in
C	yeah
B	I mean I can work through it
C	I think that's awful
B	it is
A	yeah
C	I think it's that's I mean er
A	yeah
C	the people who make these rules have got plenty of money
B	yeah
C	and they'll always have plenty of money cos they're always on the fiddle anyway aren't they?
B	that's right
C	they're always claiming their bit of
B	yeah
C	well of course they do
B	and all these er
C	yeah
C	they get loads
B	expenses and stuff
C	expenses
A	mm
C	oh
B	well you you
C	half of them
B	yeah but or it the ones you know even the ones who say you know who do it all
C	yeah
B	you know either they have a house in London and have to have one in the constituency or
C	yeah
B	vice versa
C	house yeah
B	to be done up
C	yeah yeah
B	you know
C	mm
B	and and for the and for the mortgage
C	yeah
B	when you
C	yeah
A	that's not right
B	take up why don't they say
A	it's not right
B	if you want a extra place you've gotta rent somewhere and we'll pay the rent
C	that's right yeah
B	that's why it would be fair wouldn't it?
C	that would be very fair that would be
B	but then what they'd do is they'd get the someone in the family to buy a house and rent it to them
C	well yeah
B	and that rent
A	yeah
B	would then pay the mortgage and all the upkeep
C	but the what they should have is a place like Downing street where
B	mm
C	they're in er so if if
B	there's six hundred and thirty of them ain't there?
A	mm
C	yeah
B	so they'd need a lot of property
C	well they would but I mean wouldn't it be
B	put them in a dormitory
C	yeah
C	well they got
B	cos that's right they own Chelsea barracks
C	Chelsea er barracks yeah
B	just round the corner
C	of course they have yeah
B	and they sold that ain't they
C	yeah
B	to some
C	yeah
B	and they're gonna turn it all into
C	multimillion pound
B	yeah
C	the amount of empty houses in in London is is is terrible because
B	is there a lot?
C	yeah
B	oh I know the one you're talking about it weren't all owned by one a particular but it was all owned by
