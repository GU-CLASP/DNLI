B	yeah
C	so the only thing is mum is about stations
B	oh
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and you got as far as London but dad had taken the orange and
B	mm
C	you can put a train station on London
B	oh
C	that'll cost you minus four points but it will mean you get the twenty odd points for your route
B	oh
C	okey-doke?
B	sneaky sneaky yeah it's good
C	sneaky sneaky
B	I could put that any time? or do I have to
C	mm
B	actually go up there?
C	the route needs to have a
B	it doesn't have to be me?
C	you could put it say well no
B	it doesn't have to be me?
C	if you've got as far as Amsterdam on the whites
B	yeah
C	and you wanted to get to Edinburgh and these the orange we've got the black we've got and this we've got so you'd have to put one in London and one in Amsterdam
B	uhu
C	okey-doke
B	okay
C	yeah
B	but I could put it on as far as when I got there?
C	yeah you could but that's just costing you four points more and you're not getting the points for putting down so you
B	no but I wouldn't have to put that one there cos I was there
C	yeah no you have to put
B	I can put I could put it
C	no
B	I could put that there before I got there
C	as long you can put a station on a yeah you can put it whenever but it won't count unless you're using someone else's train so like you're you're bunny-hopping on their trains and you're
B	but I could put it there
C	to get you can put it there whenever you want
B	any time
C	no but if you got as far as there you need this train for this the white this station for the carry route
B	yes but I wouldn't need those it cos there's nobody there if only there was somebody there
D	yeah but if nobody's there
E	doesn't happen
D	you would build it
B	yes I could do it in advance all I'm saying
D	but yeah but
B	can I do it in advance?
D	what? use the station or build?
B	use the station in advance
C	yes you could well do it in advance but you don't know that someone's gonna build there so no one if no train
B	no I know
C	ever comes here or here
B	but if I can see to put it would be done it already and I would still over there
C	okay but you're not gonna wanna
B	oh okay
C	really
B	yeah
C	now remember it costs you four points every time you use them
B	okay
D	and don't and they're more expensive
C	and the first station you put down costs you a card of any colour the second station you put down costs you two card of any colour the third station you put down costs you three cards of any colour
B	oh right okay
C	alright? so don't use them unless you have to really you use them when people block you or
D	it's four each yeah?
B	and how many of these did you choose?
D	these are just your
B	oh right then
B	do do I show them?
D	no
C	no
D	you've played this before haven't you?
B	yeah but if forgot I haven't played it for a long time have I?
A	why
E	do you want a bit of toffee in yours?
B	yes please
A	why don't we play this only online this was it?
C	because to touch things is nicer than looking at a screen
A	no no why don't we use stations when you're like
D	I'm not sure
C	well I've never
A	well on well no you you reverse it
C	I don't I I don't
A	maybe I'll always come last
C	you only really do stations when you do five players you don't really need it for three or four maybe four players
D	also mum at the end of the game
B	mm
C	the person who's got the longest train er single route gets an extra ten points
D	three of those oh no
C	no it's one
D	one
C	but is it is it three or four?
C	no
D	it should be four yeah it's
C	not four
D	okay so you have to choose the one you have to choose the long route
B	yeah
C	but then you only have to choose another one of a
D	but you can choose then all
C	yeah
E	when I was watching War and Peace they talked about Smolensk
B	yeah they did
E	and I was like I know exactly
B	so we've got
E	I don't want this one collect them up

C	that's on there
D	oh right yeah
A	and I do I
B	is it my go?
C	yeah it's dad's go
C	so you can take it

C	oh right so ones we've got a little animal here there's one with a tail
B	of course er no I haven't got a tail
C	erm
A	no
C	er faces and whatever so like a black homeless guy playing for money and but he'll you know and he'll take he's like he's ridiculously fast and he slammed the timer on er in public things
D	mm
C	anyway so the black guy comes out amazing and this crowd go and watch him and they start talking and they're slagging each other off and the guy starts picking him up on
D	yeah oh I saw that
C	chases and then hits him and he
B	wow
D	typical
A	why was he doing
C	it was so fast
A	I know well you know where your
C	well
D	there's lots of you know there's six
C	and his family was talking to him and distracting him and all that it was
C	he was a wide boy
B	oh that's very nice
E	yeah?
D	well
E	is it my go?
C	no
E	waiting for me? sorry
C	no it's not
E	oh
D	at the start
C	where did it all go wrong?
E	whose go is it?
C	mine
B	oh is it?
C	yeah
B	my picked up my rainbow didn't I?
C	no
D	that's the
D	that looks nice
E	it's alright
B	what's the stated colour that you can put down any time? it's the rainbow one?
E	yeah
D	yeah
E	and then when it's grey
C	and this if this is a grey it's gotta be er the same colour so it's gotta be cos it's turned grey it's gotta be two greens or
B	oh oh
C	wait wait wait
D	no one
C	take one and then it can be replaced and then maybe you want the red more than a set of yellow for example
B	oh okay I get you
E	hey look
C	the guy's passed the test
E	I can see yours there
C	you
E	okay
C	too well hidden
A	call it a two
D	there we go thank you
C	then for me dad what
D	scar's pretty cool and it sounds like a train
B	oh
C	I think these are little erm oh very nice
C	where are we?
E	you know for that little train you need to have a multicoloured card
C	wow
D	wow
C	let the cards do the talking
E	little
C	so four points for for the
E	was the
C	there a couple of turns on there
D	no
C	no?
E	have have you got
D	presenting to the group
C	wow wow wow wow
D	have you?
D	one
D	I think you need to go there
E	where?
C	where he's blocked you in
E	alright
C	scuppered your entire four cards
B	oh you just have to
E	you do all this and then he does it
C	cos it's easy to wind you up
E	I just don't I'm not buying
C	er well you'd
C	I'd buy in
E	is it my go?
B	uhu
D	this feels like a
C	who is this?
D	about gypsies and Irish
C	what a combo
D	the difference in not gypsies they're travellers so they
C	yeah
B	when remind me again how the colours I've gotta have the all the colours of the tracks?
E	yeah
B	unless I have a rainbow
C	doesn't say yeah the rainbow is a
E	yeah
C	but it's so like
E	oh not at the minute thank you maybe for breakfast
B	breakfast there's cake forks over there if you want them
E	yeah right
C	mum?
B	did somebody move me? it'll be two down
C	I'll do it now
B	why do I have to go there?
B	that means I need to buy a little thingy does it?
C	well
D	well depends where you're going
B	I need to try and
C	four points the second time and four points third and the first time a card of any colour the second time two colour third time you know
B	but say I did put that down and the two cards I can then use that
C	if you put
B	will it
C	so suppose that if you put one in Vienna or or Venice
B	mm
C	a station
B	mm
C	you're and you had a ticket from Munich to Rome
B	mm
C	you would have completed that ticket cos you would have piggybacked
B	yeah
C	but you could also put the station on Rome
B	yeah
C	so say I put my station on er Venice
B	yeah
C	for whatever reason
B	mm
C	you could still put your station on Rome but if I put my station here and
B	ah then I've just
C	then you've lost that
B	yeah
C	but you probably it's not often that someone's taken your city and the other city isn't available so
B	yeah
C	then again if this maybe the
D	no he can go
C	maybe you can
D	to to wherever you're going
C	if you can go round there then go around it
B	there's a lot to take in there's a lot to get
C	yeah
B	round it
C	yeah
B	is it four?
C	yeah
C	well it's very easy just to
B	and it won't be for two tickets?
C	one one of any card so that card colour that you don't want going up really
B	right
C	so if you know you want white for whatever reason or orange
B	I don't know
D	don't take or orange
C	you had your points on there second points on
D	oh you're going blind you've got that three mum
B	erm
D	so you can't pick a
C	seven seven points
B	it was
A	why?
C	when
A	oh
C	for however long your
A	cos I didn't have only had four for the first one
C	well you're on forty points then
B	oh what was that?
C	the longer the chain the more score
B	yeah
C	points are scored so one cards is one point two is two but three is four points four is seven points
B	oh
C	six is fifteen points for it
B	oh
C	that's where the smart
E	whose is this set?
D	it's just one
E	I was gonna say it's got that like it's still like really shiny
D	haven't played with children
E	mm
C	Ireland's actually quite racist
D	mm?
D	O'Connell's Steam Engine
E	oh right
D	can I have two points please?
E	three
C	three but if the er black comes up when you turn over three random cards then er you'd have to play another black or a multicolour so it's
D	it's good it's good practice to always have another one extra
A	mm
D	so it's so it's not it's not being sensible things going alright so if there's a black and his three collapses
B	mm
D	yeah you
E	but if I had
C	you you could if you've got another black you'd
C	or want to pay you can pay for it
A	I haven't got another black
C	oh so you've gotta do three
D	ah you've got
A	yeah
D	well
B	why does he have em back?
D	cos he didn't spend them to make the route
B	oh
B	and what do I
C	two cards of the same colour
E	which one's this? The Saviour? no
E	mm
C	er four points is it?
D	and it's seven points
E	has he died?
C	no
D	I can't get into him cos apparently
D	no but he's apparently he's amazing but just his
E	oh right
D	I you know
E	no but he can really miss as well
D	yeah but well by all accounts when he gets here
E	the first album's awesome
D	so Steve Mcqueen says he
E	really?
D	mm yeah and you know I've er I've read reviews er you know comparing him to
C	did you see him last see him in Glastonbury?
D	oh yeah he's er he's a
C	not but not just that but like performance wise
D	that was er yeah but I don't think live
C	did you see that that thing he did with the alien coming from outer space and he's been representing he's been put forward by mankind to represent the best artist that's ever been on the face of the the earth is Kanye West
A	oh no
D	are you trying again are you? one two erm
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and had to be dragged off stage
D	and that was that was
C	did you see him on those American
C	er
E	okay
D	there you go
A	my go?
D	mm
B	mm?
D	you need one joker
B	can you just move me there?
C	no
E	no
C	but you can
A	okay so if I wanted er that
D	yeah
A	okay?
A	oh but those two
E	no
A	oh
D	so yeah
A	so just those two
D	dad's go
E	dad had a go?
C	is this
D	is it? this is it I'm onto it
C	now with a something to make
E	don't tell him that
B	no
D	yeah they're two
B	collect three then
B	did I put my station in the wrong place?
C	this one is if you want what colour are you? blue?
D	that one will seem like
C	and so now what your route is Copenhagen to either Rome or Zagreb you can choose
D	what colour there mum?
B	so I
C	no she hasn't got a station there
D	no
B	did I put it in the right place where it is now?
C	it
B	okay
A	from Edinburgh to Paris
C	yeah
D	you're going to have to go round the houses
C	or put a
E	yeah
A	er well
C	you should have gone there you should have gone there and there
A	yeah but what I I could do with
C	you need yeah
A	a station
C	so yeah so you put a station on Paris or Dieppe it doesn't
A	which is
C	well it could no they would both be valid you might for tactical reasons put one on Paris or Dieppe to
A	mm
C	and you don't wanna get you don't have to do this till the end of the game but now you're guaranteeing that you're gonna do it so
A	and that's my turn then
C	yeah
B	that'll cost you four and it'll cost you
C	and a card
B	and it'll cost you a card
A	any card?
C	yeah
B	any card
E	any card
D	mm?
C	what's the one you have so far?
D	it's seven on over there
C	crucial
D	I think it's
E	whose go is it?
B	one please
D	some of them are ad free are they? I thought you had premium
E	I remember you saying you had premium
A	how much is it?
E	I dunno
E	is it?
C	there was an offer it was was it a couple of a quid for three
E	I guess it makes sense if er maybe if you work at home all day and you have it on as the radio but
C	but also the adverts are in Spanish so it's not
D	yeah
C	a bad thing to listen to it all day so
E	but I always listen to stuff on Youtube maybe I should listen to Spotify more
D	it's a bit
E	yeah
C	they make a best of for for albums and things that
A	Soundcloud
D	Soundcloud I mean it is good for music
E	it's good for music
D	the new Spotify
E	oh right
C	The Beatles are on Spotify as well aren't they?
E	are they?
D	yeah
E	well Adele's still on it
D	cos of
E	mm and Taylor Swift isn't on it
C	oh no literally don't notice
C	I just see her as like a Miley Cyrus type of thing
C	girl singing from the States
E	yeah she's not like Miley Cyrus
D	two please
C	whatever
D	Portuguese?
C	no it's
E	I do recognise the song though
C	and basically
E	what do I know the song from?
E	is it from a film?
C	yeah Shazam
E	find out yeah no but for films
A	well you
E	or adverts or
A	if you the Shazam will work for films as well because they you know there's songs and the
E	but it's more that when I hear a song I want to know the film it's from
C	but if you took that
A	yeah but if you know if you if you find a song
E	oh okay yeah
A	you just find it out like
A	there probably is one just for films
E	er it took me
E	and then I found the film eventually erm Secret Garden?
E	you know Secret Garden from Jerry Maguire?
D	yeah
E	no yeah
A	is it?
D	uhu
E	I think it's an alright film Jerry Maguire I've not watched it for a long time
D	I mean it's quite Tom Tom Cruisy
E	but like
C	show me the profits
E	but I think it's probably the last time he was maybe quite nice and charismatic and not an absolute nut job maybe?
C	a one a
D	oh it meant
C	no
D	it meant that much to you eh?
B	mm? what?
A	your go
C	one point
D	what's that?
D	what's that?
A	the best trains from the
D	I've never heard of him
A	REM
D	really?
A	you never heard you said it was on there
D	can I have a look?
C	whose go? your go dad
D	isn't on here
C	oh
E	mm
C	er maybe it wasn't
A	yeah
C	maybe REM aren't on there
C	more or less yeah
D	five
C	more or less
C	I oh you went there got three multicolours?
D	no well erm
C	you leave them on there if you're with the patterns up
D	did I do it yeah?
C	yeah well er
E	whose go is it?
D	mm yeah
A	I was wasn't I until er
D	yeah
A	until I made the last three moves
C	three multicolours?
D	yeah
C	it's really good
A	the way it turns up
C	three yeah so red turned up
A	so if I had had that
C	if you had three reds and the
D	but I'd wait till the end
A	what if have a joker
C	then that can be used
D	yeah
C	so as long as there's one red or the joker comes up from three
D	we will see oh so you've got one in the
C	yeah
A	just make one last make absolutely clear if I go from Edinburgh to Paris
C	uhu
C	yeah
A	what if I also hypothetically went from Madrid to Dieppe? can I put another
C	no
A	station there?
C	cos that's the same route
A	it covers them both
C	yeah
A	but and that goes into that
C	yeah
A	can I have three more cards please
C	yeah so you've gotta keep one of them then
A	I keep one of the cards I've got?
C	no
E	no of three of the
C	gotta keep one of the three cards one two or three but you'll
C	mum
B	I thought cos I had a rainbow I could put whatever colour I wanted
B	yeah so what does my rainbow give me?
C	you can do one of those but if you wanted to put three
D	you'll need two
C	you'd need
A	two pinks and a
C	two pinks and a rainbow or three rainbows or two rainbows and a pink
B	oh to what?
D	the other way is your way is just
B	so I can go so if I had a different colour
C	no not there
B	my rainbow is
D	mm
B	so I get more
C	yeah
D	I mean if you get another rainbow
D	what have I done?
B	it's my go?
D	yeah
B	okay so let's try some again
D	well
C	if you don't get
D	there's er because it's er it's untenable
B	yeah
D	so let's cross our finger and hope for black
C	or mum
D	a joker
C	if you had those two yellows like to tried to put there you could play the two yellows for that tunnel which is great and they your joker's acting as a backup
B	why can't I buy two yellows?
D	cos it's a grey there
E	grey is any colour
C	any colour
B	oh grey is any colour?
D	so it's not
B	oh
B	oh
C	okay so we're going for yellows then
B	yeah
D	okay
C	so that counts as a yellow but you've got a joker so you can play it
B	only the one
D	only the one well I'm afraid you're tunnel collapses
D	the workers go home
C	three
B	no that's cruel
unknown_female	mm
B	if grey is any colours why are we getting the
C	that's those ones
E	they're black
B	oh they're black are they?
unknown_female	mm
C	it really does that
unknown_female	oh
C	joker but
unknown_female	eh
unknown_female	eh
C	so you'll just have to play the joker
B	oh I think I don't have the joker cos you made me play it last time
C	now you
B	I haven't
C	you should've done
D	you got your cards back didn't you?
B	I don't know
C	well you would've had it back anyway so
C	you've
B	oh
C	huh?
C	little
B	the Kylie version or this?
C	no this this
A	the Kylie version's pretty similar
B	ow
C	not not got much soul has it?
unknown_female	get in
unknown_female	get in
C	what on Earth?
C	you're winning
D	yeah that's what I'm saying
D	who put
E	seven? can't you go?
D	yeah
C	mm
C	well well well high scorer
B	what
C	this
B	green?
D	woah
B	three
C	oh dadio
D	he was hinting that he was going there
E	whose go is it?
C	ooh
D	orange
unknown_female	mm
A	are you gonna
C	no routes?
B	tunnel
C	any colours you want is that
B	no
E	so you need one extra orange or an extra magic
C	orange
C	close very close
