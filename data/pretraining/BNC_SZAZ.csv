A	I I have a I have a theory that I just came up with right now
B	yeah yeah
A	perhaps the only way to get the perfect review
B	yeah I mean
A	or
B	even even to the extent of not watching the trailers
A	yeah
B	I try sometimes
A	to you you have no no in-depth knowledge of the movie
B	yeah
A	you have no no predestined concept ideas
B	concept
A	you I don't know maybe even go as far as to put them in the cinema and have them watch the movie don't even tell them the title
B	that that would be the fairest review
A	that would be the fairest review I believe
A	cos
B	what your friends say
B	yeah
A	maybe though eh it sort of creates a a pre
B	yeah pre
A	I mean
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	you're a guy you would know yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	eh god they're alright
A	they're alright
B	just alright
A	just alright
A	her acting? ah I haven't seen any of her films
A	yeah I know
B	yeah erm
A	she called me an idiot for that
A	Emma Watson?
B	cos of her yeah cos of her feminist views and what not erm did you
A	how old is she now?
B	she's addressing eh
A	because I can never
B	approaching
A	in my
A	sixteen-year-old Hermione Granger
B	erm yeah she she she's just finished her Oxford thing
A	oh she went to Oxford?
B	yeah she's smart
A	really?
A	that's what makes her beautiful mate
B	yeah
A	doesn't have to be it can be
B	yeah it can be of course
A	if you love someone they're always gonna be beautiful
B	ah Beyonce
A	I really can't
B	yeah go on
A	back in the middle ages the religion of Islam was the most forward religion and nation in the world
B	yeah?
A	it was seriously you know erm while
B	I haven't no
A	well after eh after the prophet Muhammad died
B	yeah
A	like in I don't know the exact years
B	yeah yeah
A	but I know the
B	right okay
A	but erm after the prophet Muhammad died
B	yeah
A	his family and his generals
B	yeah
A	soon went on to conquer lots of lands
B	yeah
A	in the Middle East and North Africa
B	okay yeah yeah yeah
A	and er eventually
B	yeah
A	one of the caliphates
B	yeah
A	whose family name was the the
B	yeah
A	hence the name
B	oh I see
A	conquered all of North Africa
B	yeah
A	all of the Middle East and southern Spain and parts of Italy
B	yeah
A	southern Italy
B	yeah
A	they conquered all of that
B	right yeah because the crusades and stuff
A	yeah the crusades were done in like twelve hundreds
B	eleven eleventh twelfth century yeah
A	but
B	yeah okay
A	AD
A	and erm
B	just check that
A	yeah and the
B	yeah
A	at its greatest extent under the caliph I think his name was Abu something
B	yeah
A	under his leadership the
B	yeah
A	in fact some of the mathematicians in the
B	wow
A	and modern day medicine
B	yeah yeah
A	one of the first one of the first modern historians of the time was Muslim
B	yeah that's great
A	and they promoted religious tolerance back then
B	yeah
A	religious tolerance and now
B	I guess that's the confusing
A	and now Islam is viewed as one of the most intolerant abusive religions in the world
B	I don't
A	it's baffling how it took such a turn
B	yeah I I
A	maybe I'm romanticising it
B	yeah I mean
A	maybe not all people
B	no I mean some people believe that is what I'm saying
A	yeah too many people believe that
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	you know when we were at the mosque?
B	yeah
A	I asked the erm the imam
B	oh the imam was crap but go on
A	I asked the imam er does erm
B	yeah
A	to go to heaven to go to your heaven?
B	yeah good question
A	and he replied with the only thing you need to do is follow the rules of Allah
B	yeah
A	and the Islamic religion to get to heaven
B	yeah
A	but then it hit me cos that is inherently flawed
B	yeah cos what about people who are never exposed to Islam?
A	yeah what about? what Mother Teresa
B	yeah
A	perfect example
B	yeah
A	one of the most selfless human beings to have lived in the twentieth twenty-first century
B	yeah but there are erm there are
A	I just find it so yeah
B	and and the concept of what Islam is
A	yeah it's not fair but the
A	yeah Sikhism Sikhism I don't know about Sikhism it just teaches that er you just have to be a good person
B	enjoy life yeah
A	and that everyone needs to be er needs to follow their own path to god
B	yeah that's good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and in that everyone is resurrected and well not
B	yeah yeah
A	depending upon your karma
B	yeah
A	but what I'd like to know is that the man said that you needed to you needed to be to be told
B	yeah
A	what the proper way to live was
B	yeah
A	so here I am wondering what if you become that person?
B	what? the person that gets taught
A	do
B	oh right yeah yeah yeah
A	do the people that you teach become?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and being selfless and kind and loving
B	yeah
A	if you teach that
B	they should do
A	they should
B	I guess people only know what they're exposed to
A	I mean if you and I went soul-searching for the rest of our lives
B	yeah
A	I still don't think we'd find the answer
B	yeah exactly well the answer is ourselves because everyone's different
A	oh that's deep dude that is deep
B	yeah may why do we have to find a purpose?
A	how? how would you? how is it flawed for you?
B	in terms of
A	mm mm
B	if you're not religious and you don't believe that you'll be rewarded in heaven
A	well
B	yeah
A	people should be given a chance to repent
B	yeah okay but
A	and if they do solemnly repent
B	yeah
A	and if they do swear it and every fibre of their being does repent for the actions of
A	then I believe it should be right
B	yeah okay but what but what about the situations where you know people aren't prosecuted because you should love everyone anyway? you know? someone slaps you you turn the other cheek that's not oh take them to court if they're
A	well
B	that's straight up erm allowing people to get away with stuff you know?
A	I like to think that if humans
B	aboded yeah yeah abided
A	every person on the planet since the dawn of human history I don't think we'd have paedophiles
B	no but paedophiles there's there's something
A	or people like that
B	they're not they don't choose to be evil they're just intrinsically wrong there are there are you know eh eh psycho killers who there are psychopaths who like killing people cause their brain is made that way in the same way that you and I would like certain things naturally
A	I'm more
B	the only the only issue you know? I believe anyone should follow what they want and then they have a right to enjoy what they like as long as it doesn't hurt other people and that's where it's wrong to be a rapist or a paedophile but
A	I guess that is true
B	so yes
A	well so you'd allow things like doing drugs
B	oh
A	to the point where you kill yourself from overdose?
B	no because then that because then that then
A	the government already spends billions every year trying to fix alcoholics
A	yeah and it spends billions just as much on security for drugs
B	yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
A	humanity is too big I think
B	yeah
A	it's too big
B	so many views in itself anyway even if we took religion out of it there'd be so many ethical views on
A	yeah
B	subjects that
A	people would still be like separated and against certain things
B	yeah they would
A	I mean I like the maybe even if people eh
B	yeah sure
A	oh wait no yeah
B	if you yeah you hold the camera
A	even if people are
B	yeah
A	and applied religionless ethics to issues like euthanasia
B	yeah
A	I still think people would have a problem with it
A	yeah I mean
B	I guess we need to just protect each other
A	help each other?
B	yeah
A	what happens if you keep going straight?
B	er eh there's a path down
A	yeah
B	yeah it's a different way erm
A	nice lights though that's one of the reasons I said we should go
B	yeah oh good choice hold on let me check the time erm
A	thank goodness we aren't
B	some
A	I couldn't bear to be ignorant
B	yeah
A	actually do you think you'd know if you were ignorant?
B	no it's like the the Socrates
A	but
B	yeah
A	lower pleasures are defined as being animalistic
B	yeah
A	virtues which do produce some sense of satisfaction and gratification
B	uhu
