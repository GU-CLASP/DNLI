A	I do have to say
B	it has got character to it
A	like Peterborough for example has
B	yeah it's got quite a lot of character yeah
A	is quite distinctive
B	yeah
A	well never having been to those bits
B	I was going to say yeah
A	can we hire a car to do it?
B	yeah
A	that is cool though that eh that building
A	yeah
B	bless her
B	we could have gone left
A	I'm glad we didn't
B	me too
A	have you got your thing going?
B	this
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	Good
B	yeah it'll be nice actually
A	it's a little bit eh
A	it's good
B	yeah I think so yeah
A	I love that the eh the eh
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's like when people em have like van doors at the back and they sort of have stuff sticking out the back of them and at the end they sort of tie a bit of string to the end to them so you you know can see where they are but
A	em em
B	yeah
A	for the greater good
B	the greater good
A	yeah
B	and they  And they  planted loads of em flowers and lovely arrangements and plants and you know all kinds of stuff they made it look lovely outdoors
A	seriously?
B	yeah yeah
A	I thought it would take more effort to
B	well maybe they didn't completely plant them
A	who wouldn't
B	well yeah
A	when you're desperate rent a whippet
B	rent a whippet?
A	yeah
B	who's going to rent a whippet?
A	no to fit in
B	oh right yeah
A	with the class environs
B	environs yes
A	mm
B	are you going to get your flat cap?
A	I'm considering it
B	Cos it would be different sort of flat caps
A	in what sense?
B	well flat cap and whippet is you know very working class miner sort of thing
A	well actually it wasn't what I was going for
B	no? Fair enough
A	it was just
B	you just fancied a flat cap?
A	yeah basically
B	I'm sure can find one at
A	I just remember my dad had one when I was growing up and it was
B	you thought it was me
A	where's your dad's cap
B	he's got one now?
A	no he doesn't wear it much
B	he does occasionally wear it
A	yeah but it's
B	yeah a manly hat
A	exactly
B	no
A	no that it wasn't
B	I think that's the difference between our fathers
A	he doesn't does he?
B	yeah sometimes
A	seriously?
B	well yeah cos his head burns quite easily
A	yeah so does my dad's but that's why he wears a Tilly hat
B	yes indeed
A	oh
B	I don't think he'd like it
A	I used to want one
B	yeah what was that about? We were packing up and there was some
A	then God we're not going on this holiday
B	yeah I was it was stressful just being in the kitchen with them
A	well that's a decent side road
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm trying to think eh
A	A thousand
B	A thousand
A	Cos otherwise it could be a centigram
B	yeah
A	or something to do with a hundred not a thousand
B	yeah
A	I'm glad we got that figured out
B	yeah that's good that's sorted
A	remind me to start carrying around sunglasses okay?
B	yeah
A	well I've got two pairs anyway so I might keep one in the car as a sort of emergency pair
B	yeah
A	or at least no
B	in all fairness
A	well I will actually need to remember that I need to start taking them with me
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	right yeah
A	yeah
B	no no it is nowadays
A	yeah for me it's a it would be a long drive to get  to get  to a holiday location
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I would imagine so
A	yeah
B	do you want me to have a look so you know where it is?
A	no it's okay I just want to see where they
B	yeah I don't think they're going to let you miss that one
A	I hope not anyway
B	yeah
A	so em do you want to give
B	yeah
A	I think I would like to get some
B	okay well I maybe
A	what?
B	I'm trying to think what em
A	well no it's it's about seven o'clock on a Sunday but he's going to have to get a taxi anyway to get there
B	Nn no no not going back but coming to
A	can you not?
B	that's fine I'll ask him what time the last bus is
A	sorry?
B	he rang quite late last night
A	I like housemates
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	I didn't think of that
B	oh right yeah
A	well what was the
B	I think it's just sort of part of their idea of em kind of
A	humungous waste of time and funds
B	mm
A	barely
B	yeah it just seems like a kind of slightly odd yeah use of eh
B	yeah exactly it's so hard to measure the fact whether you'll get any
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	em
B	oh right okay
A	yeah yeah that's what he was saying
B	cool
A	it should be quite a nice weekend
B	yeah it'll be nice actually I'm really looking forward to it
A	that's a problem
B	if we stop at
A	sorry?
A	an OS map if we can
B	oh yeah
A	where does it go? Not sure em
B	yeah how random
A	why is there a footpath
B	well you know fair enough
A	who
B	yes
A	eh yeah
B	alright just if there's no wind
A	unless it's a specifically restricted dual carriageway which this might be I don't know I don't think so
B	is that when they have those big signs no pedestrians no horse drawn carriages
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	yes if go back to space you might collect
B	ah silly car
A	leaving that aside it's actually very pleasant driving
B	mm
A	it's a very interesting road
B	yeah that was good idea
A	oh wind turbine
B	ah that's a nice view actually
A	how the hell did that come up?
B	I can't remember
A	oh yes
B	that was quite a bizarre night but quite fun
A	totally bizarre yeah
B	how cool is
A	it sounded pretty awful
B	it's sounds awful yeah I'm sure it is awful one kind of yeah
A	my job is inadvertently quite glamorous
B	yeah
A	which film?
B	Snow White and the Huntsman
A	it had a cool trailer
B	yeah it did actually yeah
A	no I'm not
B	she didn't seem massively sure
A	it looks shit
B	well yeah but she did say that the trailer is the funniest thing ever
A	mm
B	the supervision of music
A	in fairness though
B	yeah yeah I mean
A	not particularly
B	no she's very confident
A	not particularly
B	Don't you think?
A	it wasn't my overwhelming impression
B	fair enough
A	em
B	but yeah em it was funny this morning we were like I didn't realise she had such a deep kind of throaty laugh and I was like don't mention the fags
A	your parents would actually ask you that question?
B	no no no they wouldn't but I was a bit like
A	no as in your parents would ever be in any doubt whether you might
B	well yeah
A	well do you want to
B	yeah but okay
A	and just sort of
B	okay
A	well actually tell him that
B	he's also said em I'm thinking I should probably stay until latest tenish
A	okay
B	probably wants an early night
A	eh yeah and em
B	cool
A	yeah well see if he wants to come along
B	okay cool
A	I'm also possibly thinking
B	yeah no definitely
A	sparring pads
B	sparring pads apparently they're called
A	alright
B	okay
A	or that's your contribution
B	I didn't say would you mind awfully
A	no but that's why how it was phrased
B	okay
A	yeah it was very hesitant
B	okay
A	this isn't best way of servicing the
B	it's not no
B	it's
A	ah yes
B	I think it was cool
A	again
B	okay that sounds like a plan for the evening then
A	yeah
B	any eh
A	I'm really not sure
B	what's a nice sort of sunny day
A	beach boys
B	beach boys?
A	maybe some ABBA
B	aBBA that would fun
B	yeah
A	it's worth a try
B	and not Dancing Queen
A	no
B	we should watch Mamma Mia
A	mm
B	yeah
A	as ever
B	yeah the em the kind of weirdly shaped hill is called
A	Roseberry Topping
B	Roseberry Topping yeah
A	Roseberry Topping
B	it does sound like a dessert
A	yes it does rather
B	what will the
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	eh I don't relay know how many DVDs
B	right hard to know whether it would be kind of you know thirty pounds no one really buys them so they can charge more
A	I think we found her for a tenner in HMV the other day
B	yeah
A	watch it by
B	yes
A	I found them in HMV and they were about twenty quid
B	I think it was twenty something it was
A	well that's fine
B	it's fine but I think look on Amazon because
A	it's cheap for two box sets like that
B	but yeah but I think it's worth looking on Amazon because they might just have it reduced I think they're more likely to have it reduced and it's not you know not any different from getting it from town
A	well it is because you have to wait and I want to
B	depends
A	well if not you have to wait about a week
B	yeah that's not et end of the world
A	I'd like it urgently
B	okay fair enough
A	yes it would
B	I didn't realise you were feeling for urgent but yeah
A	no I just want to
B	okay
A	but it won't
B	okay well we'll have a look
A	no
B	and I I wouldn't particularly be able to pick out a favourite series
A	I think it even improves with age because the relationships develop
B	yeah I think they
A	yeah I found myself liking
B	yeah yeah
A	I've not heard that
B	off the back of the boxes
A	oh right
B	maybe it wasn't maybe it was deliberate so maybe it was kind of it was a cliff hanger where you thought he was dead
A	wow
B	what's that?
A	we'll find out in a minute
B	yeah
A	that is very cool
B	sweet
A	this guy is
B	yeah not bad
A	he's not
B	yeah
B	in
A	talking of driving at some point I do probably next Saturday need to check the oil and tyre pressures
B	right yeah yeah
A	I think you need to
B	yeah I did
A	yeah
B	we can do it now
A	yes you could
B	it doesn't have to be particularly nice you know
A	it's a good vacuum for doing almost anything
B	yeah pretty much
A	then you don't have the change bags
B	yeah well exactly
A	and of of course in ten years that pays for itself
B	exactly yeah
A	well it's probably not patented as a new so you probably get sort of home brand ones
B	so funny last night when you and
A	yeah it was wasn't it
B	that was really funny
A	yes but I now like
B	yeah but we do all like the cars our father have driven
A	yes
B	and my other favourite is Hadglider
A	suit and a bikini
B	yeah
A	I like this
B	use the accent
A	what?
B	beach holiday in Barbados
A	maybe
B	I love that stay stay in a hostel cos it's better to meet people
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	sorry?
B	that's finished
A	yes we could
B	I imagine it's very long
A	well if not tonight then certainly tomorrow
B	yeah that'd be fun
A	no I'd like to watch it all the way through so maybe tomorrow
B	okay
A	that looks like a dog
B	what does?
A	Small
B	in the back? I didn't see it
A	oh
B	yes
A	I love that
B	ah yes it's in Chinese
B	mm
A	I imagine the hills would be accessible
B	I like the hills like I like my women
A	eh?
A	you do
B	exactly about ELT
A	well I have  more ideas for our oxygen thing
B	yes
A	actually let's think about this for a second
B	yeah yeah
B	you should watch Mamma Mia at some point
A	I saw the first half and it's not too bad
B	it's a really good film
A	it does feature Colin Firth singing which is why I want to watch it
B	oh god so bad
A	and the other chap I just can't think who he is
B	Stellan Skarsgard
A	yeah
B	he is actually getting really famous
B	no no well he was in Pirates I think
A	oh
B	and he was in that weird oh probably a film that you wanted to watch about the em the kind of school
A	oh yeah yeah
B	that looked really good
A	probably yeah
B	well it did look really good
A	yeah well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I love that
A	forty
B	well no
A	right
B	hey
A	okay
B	oh the cooling things
A	yeah
B	ah
A	yeah just that you should not be pulled out in front of us
B	yeah
A	I don't care who you are it's not acceptable
B	yeah
A	is he breaking the speed limit?
B	interesting
A	to be foolish
B	well we've got it recorded but unfortunately not in any way that would eh provide evidence
A	it is very annoying
B	yeah
A	just what are they gaining
B	just you can't do that
A	which other guy?
B	this other guy behind him wasn't going to give him lots of room so
A	what the lorry?
B	yeah sorry the lorry behind well isn't just pulled back in
A	yeah they
B	yeah
A	em
B	mm? What did you say there?
A	I was just saying superb
B	superb
A	that car has very constructively speeded up aggressively
B	yeah
A	alright
B	yeah it's really bad
A	well you could  you could  if you'd actually caught it
B	yeah
A	you're either  on you're not
B	yeah
A	ah
B	yes never mind
A	oh cyclists
B	I didn't think you were allowed cyclists
B	yeah afar enough I guess
A	I don't know it's a straight road
B	yeah there is actually nice little cycle lane down here
A	bizarrely
B	yeah
B	do you want me to have a look?
A	yeah just to check
B	but all the signs have been saying A1
A	we're getting to the
B	oh that's
B	wouldn't do that
A	no it's there
B	yeah so em we need to go on
A	but it's a direct
B	yeah
A	likely I should think
B	I've got
A	it's actually
B	yeah it's on the
A	oh
B	it's impressive
A	have you what sorry?
B	underestimating his appeal
A	yeah I think that's that  We were on it when we went to em  or whatever it is
B	right
A	that's
B	shandy Hall yes
A	oh right
B	so yeah sorry yeah so I should explain
A	because it was
B	they were what sorry?
A	it was semi-autobiographical
B	em kind of em
A	right
B	yeah
A	eh
B	very nice
A	interesting just to
B	yeah no I mean what I'd really like to do is em we all go to  so we leap to
A	yeah
B	yeah files miles to the
A	just get a
B	get a what sorry?
A	get our roast dinner sorted out
B	yeah
A	that's
B	ah
A	my favourite bit is when he's eh up at
B	oh yeah
A	by memorising this leaflet
B	so good
B	sorry?
A	ah I'm just feeling
B	my parents want to borrow it at some point I think
A	do they? Fine
B	I think they said they would
A	I'll give it to dad when he turns up
B	okay
A	eh I do need to text
B	text
A	Great
B	I'll just say how are you going?
A	how are we going em
B	yeah
A	something like that
B	just wondering if you know em when you're back again
A	let's see eh
B	yeah
A	otherwise
B	yeah yeah it's true
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	ah yes this is a straight feed in
B	yeah
A	ah
B	that was unfortunate
A	mm
B	not really sure why
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	way to get here
B	it's very easy isn't it all this eh
A	much easier as well
B	that's easier than going up and then coming off the
A	with that really annoying bit at Busford
B	cross the what?
A	at Busford there with the
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah that'll be them
B	cool
A	yes
B	so
A	Snape?
B	Snape yeah as in the character
A	oh so
B	this is an awesome song
A	nice
B	of course it is difficult to like switch track on a record
A	yes it is
B	like in the past the the order of song an album is recorded in now
A	yes now but yes in terms of its
B	yeah I mean in all fairness I still like listening to albums in sequence
A	yeah so we'll be at Wetherby in in about ten minutes
B	get some food
A	are we going to have lunch?
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah exactly
A	yes
B	ah it's so sad
A	haven't met the new boy yet
B	no true he might be amazing
A	true but it would be hard to beat
A	mm
B	I do think it's really interesting though how it's worked out for him cos he always oh
A	who is he?
B	em it's
A	say we're just both thinking about you and
B	yeah
B	sorry?
A	six minutes
B	awesome
A	he's decided not to
B	it's interesting that he's not that bothered and it's not really his thing
A	well they tend to have that effect
B	I was very dubious but he said it should be done
A	yeah
B	yes and em next next time we go we'll make sure we meet him
A	yes
B	he is it's great
A	well I suppose they're people of his own generation
B	well yeah
A	well that is mostly for
B	yeah
A	as in if it's something he wants to do it is a very good job
B	what
A	I said if it was something he wanted to do it's a very good job
B	yes
A	it's very good
B	yea yeah
A	Southend
B	Southend
A	mm
B	sorry?
A	I said excuse me
B	Excused
A	Cos I burped
B	no need to be excused for that
A	thank you
B	anything bigger
A	em
B	expensive
A	it's about ninety seconds
B	cool
B	I just no I started saying that yes
A	yeah
B	it must be making a racket inside the car
A	it's half a mile now
B	he's pulling back in
A	yeah
B	bloody hell
A	that is very scary
B	yeah
A	now I'm interested to see where this individual parks
B	probably right in the middle of two spaces
A	no I meant close to us or not
B	oh right
A	shall we eat lunch and then go into the tour bus?
B	yeah I'm happy to do that
A	Cos then we can sort of
B	I respectfully disagree
A	yes
B	ah lovely
A	right
B	shall I get lunch?
A	I would yes
B	there's all the thing
A	yeah that's fine
B	yeah I think so yeah
A	oh good
B	put that in the back
A	thank you
B	I've got ham and cheese
A	cheese of the fruit variety
B	ah ha
A	and motorway noise
B	lovely spot for a picnic
A	maybe not entirely
B	this is nice
A	if you say so
B	mm
A	quite nice
B	mine's ham hock and extra mature cheddar cheese on multi-seed farmhouse brown bread
A	ah yeah
B	what do you think about my mum's bread? What? Oh no link there
A	when did we have your mum's bread?
B	as toast
A	mm
B	well I do wonder if it's any cheaper
A	the cakes weren't
B	of course cos you've had them before cos I've brought some on holiday once
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	em I'm happy either way
A	I'd quite like to keep it personally I just thought I should offer
B	no it's fine
A	didn't want anything else
B	well exactly
A	yes
B	we could still smell Catherine's fag a little bit in the  in the  kitchen when she was smoking it
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I was quite proud of the solution
B	no it was a very clever solution
A	shows I have working class roots too
B	nice
A	on television
B	which working class person have you seen lighting a fag on a hob?
A	Terry
B	ah right
A	want to get a lead on that dog otherwise it's going to have a very short life
B	what's this?
A	oh there's a spaniel out the
B	well quite
A	sorry?
B	grape? Eh
A	yes I will
B	not very nice not to tell us that the em mango wasn't
A	mm
B	yeah
A	okay
B	cued
A	mm
A	in principle yeah in practice no
B	Cos dogs keep each other company kind of well enough
A	some dogs do
B	whereas for some dogs would it not make much difference em
A	well the spaniels are sort of neither here nor there
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	yeah it's much more fun on a PhD?
A	well I enjoyed the fourth year project a lot but it was only half the time
B	yeah it would be a lot more just sitting doing things by yourself as opposed to
A	yeah I think that would have been the wrong decision
B	yeah
A	but except wasn't brilliantly well paid and not that interesting
B	yeah so I mean
A	I mean it it didn't occur to me that it was essentially a job until
B	until you talked to
A	right yeah until
B	well that's good I mean
A	mm
B	yes
