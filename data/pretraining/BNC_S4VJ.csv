A	mm
B	so do you wanna know where I went today?
A	yes where did you go today this afternoon?
B	erm I went basically out to see the People at Work photography exhibition which was advertised as being at the
A	okay
B	and erm it was er nine photographers were asked to take photos of people at work
A	okay
B	erm and the purpose behind it seems to be to dispel the idea that industry in Britain is dead
A	right
B	and it might've been because nobody could find it
A	okay so you and you believed this person?
B	okay
A	mm
B	cos it wasn't terribly well labelled
A	wouldn't you have just
B	well the
A	well when you
B	yeah
A	said that you know aboutthe second floor I was
B	it's very very big and you you know we've been there before there's you know it's big enough to
B	there's huge er installations in it
A	yeah it's poor isn't it?
B	anyway I didn't go straight there because erm I I I went on the three sixty and when I got off the bus I was outside the
A	oh right
B	and the tin pots do you remember when the Argentinian protest they always took out pots and pans?
A	yeah the noise they made coming down the street wow
B	mm
A	we used them over here as well did we or not?
B	no I don't think so I think they I think they've been erm repeated elsewhere in the world but I don't think they've been used in the UK
A	mm
B	so erm and there was quite a bit to read about that you know sort of
A	mm yeah
B	wasn't a very explanation er
A	is that like it's funny the museum I've
B	yeah
A	or which you know?
B	erm what was interesting was the queue to get in the
A	oh was it?
B	really big but
A	they people take their kids there more don't they?
B	yeah but you'd think people would take their kids to the
A	yeah I thought it was
B	yeah
A	there's things they can
B	interactive displays and yeah there's lots
A	displays yeah sure
B	but I suppose a lot of children like dinosaurs don't they and
A	yeah it's got
B	erm anyway when I went into the
A	where is that?
B	it's actually in the
A	on in the
B	yeah
A	oh
B	you know lots of people doing the same thing
A	I have some remembrance of doing this as
B	mm
A	to watch a certain
B	well when we were kids didn't we have those plastic glasses that would be one red
A	type of thing
B	and that was meant to do something
A	mm
B	I mean really it's it it it makes you jump the
A	is it?
B	the an owl flew out of the screen pretty
A	mm mm
B	early on and you know and it's you know it really did feel very very close you know erm and erm
A	mm
B	and they erm the serious astronomers all work in the desert in Chile
A	yeah
B	a
A	sure
B	zero light pollution from you know?
A	yeah
B	and erm so he said
A	it's something lettuce and tomato
B	no V not B
A	no no I know
B	oh
A	erm the VLT
B	yeah
A	er something er the visual land telescope
B	yeah well you got the telescope bit right the very large telescope
A	very large
B	and they've got four VLTs in this erm place and erm the pictures were fantastic
A	pictures of what?
B	erm galaxies and you know erm
A	oh right
B	erm the I it wasn't
A	it must be fantastic that sort of this mustn't it?
B	yeah the I mean my only complaint really was that it wasn't very well explained
A	mm mm
B	it was like you know here's one where the star's exploded and it didn't really tell you
A	mm
B	why or how and you know the
A	does it matter it's only just?
B	probably not I mean it was it was more visual impact than explaining
A	yeah
B	you know the science behind it but I
A	big ALMA
B	because they can't see erm
A	wasn't that the name of Ray Moore's wife big big Alma?
B	Ray Moore the radio
A	yeah
B	yes and there was an Alma on Coronation Street as well
A	he had a
B	so I can thoroughly recommend erm a 3D experience
A	mm
B	erm
A	there are 3D actual movies made now aren't there?
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and do people sit with
B	yeah
A	as I say they tried this years and years forty years ago nearly
B	yeah but I don't think they had the
A	yeah
B	erm the the the the techniques would've been very erm basic and crude
A	mm yeah no it was the way it was pretty underwhelming then quite frankly
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and also the IMAX experience as well is cos
A	the height the screen is
B	the height of the screen yeah
A	was it?
B	enormous yeah
A	so what room is is you know is it where is it actually?
B	on the second floor of the
A	for but you'd think it you say it's the height of all that
B	yeah
A	you know how come it's? er are those
B	well maybe it goes down you know
A	mm
B	it it might be like the edge of the building or something like the whole of the erm you know I dunno
A	yeah
B	but it's very it's enormous
A	mm
B	but of course there is that one at near Waterloo isn't there at the roundabout the the IMAX one?
A	yeah well I thought that was an
B	yeah it is yeah yeah
A	I knew I'd heard it somewhere
B	yeah
A	mm
B	film
A	mm
B	no no I
A	mm
B	and erm you know
A	yeah no sure
B	I didn't need to book tickets to anything
A	okay
B	but I looked and I
B	and I
A	mm
B	and I couldn't wouldn't have been able to get across the road and down to the bus stop so I decided I was gonna race this three sixty to
A	on the tube
B	on the tube yeah so I thought if if the three sixty's got to sort of contend with traffic
A	mm
B	you know I thought I could probably beat it if I
A	but you were not right
B	mm
A	you saw it in disappear into the distance
B	yeah when I came out of
B	so
A	thought a bus good bus will always get a good tube will always beat a good bus
B	yeah but you
A	oh sure yeah I mean you were stood to get a a distance to walk to
B	the museums back to back to
A	I know it's bloody yeah long time I used to go in there years ago
B	yeah
A	oh we walked down there didn't we?
B	yeah we did
A	cos you were on about some opera or something
B	yeah
A	oh
B	so it was yeah it was good yeah and erm I didn't I didn't get my proms ticket I
A	mm
B	didn't go in the
A	you can't do it all
B	can't do everything can you?
A	you can't do it all I've always said that
B	no
