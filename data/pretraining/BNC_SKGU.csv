A	you know what I mean? we're the bully in the playground sort of thing
B	yeah
A	where
B	that's what we were saying yeah
A	sometimes history and tradition does drag you back
B	we've got the brand but we don't use we don't use it as much as we should
A	no
B	which is what we're trying to do now
A	no
B	we're trying to get more
B	mm
A	bits they should be
B	in a way it's even more with
A	yeah
A	no that's right
B	yeah exactly even though they've got no idea where the fuck it is they're still like oh yeah
A	they've heard of
B	with
A	yeah but I mean
B	mm
A	because you've got
B	it's just nicer
A	you've got the
A	but
B	yeah
A	in two thousand and thirteen
B	mm
A	and I need you to help me project manage me
B	I can do mum but you have to want to do it
A	I'm not
B	the problem why projects fail is human intervention and human failings
A	I know well that's what I want I want
B	erm I have something on Sunday but then nothing apart from that
A	but you haven't got anything on on Saturday?
B	no why?
A	could you come over?

A	I know I know I know I know I know I know
B	yeah
A	did you like that garage anyway?
B	yeah I know it's very beautiful but they
A	doesn't include delivery doesn't include this
B	yeah it doesn't add
A	well I've found another one where it does include delivery for that price
B	and it's just like why are you charging me to deliver something I'm paying eighty thousand pounds for you jammy bastards?
A	mm
B	like fuck you
B	yeah I think if you rang them up and negotiated you'd say like we really like this but
B	then they they
B	it's a sale at the end of the day and they they wanna sale
A	and the thing is
B	but it's just it's I think it just needs to be done
A	well this is what I said to him I said what I want to do
B	yeah you can do that can't you?
A	you know he can do his own breakfast
B	yeah that's fine
A	so I while he's doing that
B	mm
A	but I need to do that every day
B	apparently it takes twenty-one days to create a routine
A	well
B	I can't do that mum
A	well give me the tools
B	I will but you've gotta do it
A	give me the tools alright?
B	it's as simple as having a spreadsheet and ticking off the days you go
A	right well you have to you have to help me
B	I will but you need to do
A	good
B	yeah I know I'm trying mum but you
A	no you can't physically push me but you can set me a schedule
B	yeah
A	you can
B	mm
A	you can actually make it into two separate little areas like you'll have the shower room and the bed up one end
B	yeah
A	and then
B	yeah
A	and like
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that's only four hundred quid
B	he doesn't need it that big
A	no no no he doesn't need it quite that big but he can have
B	yeah
A	and
B	that's what I
A	and he can have like like the woman you know the
B	mm
A	and and things like this
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	he could even have the one of
A	and and
B	it's got to be his space
A	it's got to be his space absolutely
A	no no no no he's got to cos he's gotta
B	but he needs that space and you need that space as well
A	yeah
A	so
B	so then he if he wants to go watch TV instead of sitting in
A	yeah
B	he can he obviously can sit in your living room but if he sits in his living room it's his domain and his space
B	yeah
A	they're about four hundred pounds each but
B	yeah yeah
A	and so he can have those on in his room
B	yeah but how expensive is that?
A	it's not expensive because you they they
B	oh
A	and they keep it at twenty-two
B	yeah
A	kick in but
B	yeah yeah yeah true
A	you know his money
B	oh no
A	jesus christ that home last week
B	and that makes it smell even more
A	oh
A	the heat just
B	yeah
A	absolutely
B	I just I can imagine it being so nice it would be so
A	and the other thing
B	it'll be so much better
A	the other thing we'll do is we'll put a very cheap laminate on the floor
B	yeah like a wooden laminate
A	a a yeah
B	some of the ones we saw in Wickes last week weren't expensive I didn't think
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah yeah
A	I just
B	room his room
A	but
B	yeah
A	he can kick it up to that
B	yeah
A	on
A	erm
A	at the weekend we normally set it at eighteen
B	mm
A	much warmer
B	but it's it's just
A	oh god
B	and the thing is
A	mm
B	I said I rang dad
A	mm?
B	you can have a day where you like if I even if I did it twice a month or once a month
A	yeah
B	you've still got a Friday where you can go out shopping or you can go out for a
A	mm
B	and I could just like I just need to sit there I just need to be there
A	no I don't think he'd care either
B	cos he knows that I do my job so
A	if you're on the internet and you're connectable
B	exactly
A	it doesn't matter does it?
B	and that's the point like it doesn't matter if I work from my house your house I can work from home and just sit with
A	I've got to have it yeah
B	so I think that works really well as well
A	mm
B	if I can work from home on Fridays
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I used to make meals for
B	yeah
A	not
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and that made life a lot easier because although we were eating
B	yeah
A	and I said to
B	do you
B	you can eat with
A	he's not
B	he is he has lost a lot of weight
A	he looks old
B	he looks fine I think he looks okay but I don't think he should lose any more
B	yeah
A	it's that he has smaller meals but he has
B	yeah
A	he eats a lot of
B	mm
A	and I think that's where he's going wrong
B	yeah
A	he needs more protein
B	I love protein
A	so do I
B	yeah
A	individual pie dishes
B	yeah
A	six individual pies or whatever or what
B	Cornish pasty and vegetable and stuff it's a really nice meal
A	it's a meal yeah it's a proper meal
A	mm
A	and it doesn't cost a lot
B	yeah exactly I think he'll be I think he'll be fine and
A	mm
B	he was there all the time
A	yeah
B	and but if you haven't
A	yeah
B	you
A	no and I said to I said to
B	yeah
A	we'll knock and say you know are you alright dad? or whatever
B	yeah no you need a you need a baby alarm or a baby monitor
A	yeah
B	because you know how many times when he
A	mm
B	when he came to you and you could hear him going to to the bathroom and you can hear him like going like oh like
A	mm
B	I know he's not not purposely moaning but he is moaning and you've got to make sure that he's okay
A	mm
B	yeah not moving yeah
A	so I've got that little blue
B	do you think?
A	mm
B	you're gonna have to
A	yeah I'll have to have a path
B	shed
A	oh yeah
B	oh yeah true
A	because of the fact that
B	yeah
A	so we've got to have a path from the car to there anyway
B	true
A	we told them to have their bathroom done and they didn't
B	yeah
A	so if she argues about this I will say to her what about the ten thousand for the car?
B	mm
A	I will and if
B	no
A	and I think your father's idea about
B	yeah
A	two or three
B	or in like an
A	yeah
B	I don't
A	but yeah I can't deal with it and I
B	but that apparently it just needs to be sorted I think dad
A	I know
B	no there's no point saying you know because you know because you haven't done it
A	no I know
B	but then if
A	if she turns around and says well he caused me so much problem that I had to have it done
B	fuck off did he?
A	yeah exactly
B	it was leaking before he even arrived
A	I know
B	she can't take she wouldn't've been able to take it out of his bank account without you knowing anyway
A	well I've asked her for the accounts and she won't give them to me
B	well then she'll give them to dad won't she?
A	yeah she'll have to
B	and anyway grandad wouldn't know if
A	well he
B	it's fraud
A	well
A	so I could claim that
B	I don't think they cannot if we're doing it to benefit him
A	no they could do because it says it
B	car yeah
A	er
B	now we're even
A	so we're even
B	fuck off
A	and
B	in
A	and that's what right that's what that
B	it's your own fault
A	well no it's not gonna add any value on because we then have to turn around and pay out of our own
B	yeah
B	well no that was you
A	no it's not
B	no he said about the partition
A	but he's the one who
B	but you're not poor
A	we're not poor
B	no but I think you're okay at the moment
B	you're not poor
A	what that brown one?
B	who needs four handbags?
A	I had a lovely little black one and your father threw it out
B	who needs four handbags mother?
A	I do
B	exactly
