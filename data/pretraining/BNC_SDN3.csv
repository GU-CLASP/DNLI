B	but we're going north
A	oh they're about like between ten and twenty minutes apart so it's not too bad

A	no I haven't oh it's about half an hour to the next one though isn't it?
B	yeah that's fine
A	yeah
B	shall we have a look at photos of
A	yeah
B	yeah no I don't know
A	yeah I still didn't think it is where it is
B	no I
A	I didn't think it was like so near the coast
B	yeah
A	yeah I dunno
B	but it looks like really pretty this one
A	oh yeah
A	it's just like the mountains
A	I don't think so I think it's
B	oh okay
A	well it's it was fifteen minutes from to
B	yeah
A	no no idea I think that was just the biggest place on
B	on the thing so yeah it's got one of these kind of
A	oh yeah so yeah
B	here
A	yeah there
B	yeah
A	so I don't know if that's the closest beach I don't know
B	isn't the
A	oh was there? I don't know
B	and they got
B	like it's a place where you can collect cockles and they were like workers and they all got swept out to sea
A	oh no
B	was it
A	oh no
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	I don't I don't like what do cockles taste nice?
B	do
A	they they sell them in the in
B	in the Co-op?
A	in the Co-op by the pub in like little jars and I was like what why do people eat them?
B	oh really
A	they're like really
B	are they like because erm well maybe they kind of like
A	oh yeah
B	maybe it was at
A	I know there was I don't know I don't know if it was oysters there was somewhere where they stopped that's where like oysters first came from in England or something but I mean that was like down in Cornwall way
B	look
A	so I'm thinking of something totally different
B	here's yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah no they are nice in pasta like but I'm not sure if I'd just want to eat them on their own
A	yeah like yeah
B	yeah have a snack
A	I don't know yet how like how many of them she sells but I can't imagine it's a lot
B	no are they fresh?
A	I don't know well some of the jars I'm pretty sure have been there for a while
B	so they're like so you buy the jar?
A	I think they're like two pounds for a jar like that big
B	and they come in the shells? or
A	yeah
B	yeah here we go the two thousand and four Morecombe Bay cockling
A	is that like the actual?
B	the cockle
A	it's a cockle
B	have you never heard of that? oh well we won't go cockling then

B	international cuisine we've got the five star Michelin restaurant on Tuesday
A	did you bring your ball gown?
A	I'd laugh if we actually did and
A	no we're always being serious
B	I looked at the map and I think the erm I think the Holiday Inn is really central like really near the station you know so when we get there we can just
A	oh is it?
B	I think we can walk yeah
A	ah it's quite actually I should probably get it out because it's er we'll probably need it won't we?
unknown_female	yeah spot on Tuesday spot on man I've locked it up
unknown_female	oh right cool nice one
unknown_female	yeah yeah no problem
A	I'll wait until he's
B	yeah
A	I don't know why I put them at the bottom though? well they're not they're like in the middle
B	I always do that
A	yeah I will just be able to see my face
B	I need to eat when we when we get there we can like find oh because of the meeting finishes at five we could have er maybe a quick like like half an hour walk around
A	yeah
B	oh like just like a normal day
B	yeah
A	so that's fine and it's quite a while to the
B	yeah I think we're going to have to get a taxi every day
A	yeah or the
B	yeah I think
A	yeah by bus
B	I think
A	might as well get a taxi that's true actually
B	a limousine
A	definitely a limousine with champagne
B	that's the that's the uni
A	that's the uni map I printed off that one and I made that one
B	oh okay
B	yes I was like oh
A	yeah it is isn't it? like it's got like a proper like driveway going in well a road even like separate little road set I was like it's massive
B	wow
A	yeah
B	but there was it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't that big really
A	no I don't remember there being like roads when I went to it
A	like my erm
B	no
A	yeah so they were just like studying plays and stuff and that's not really what she wanted to do erm
B	yeah
A	yeah I was like I never actually knew of that one because I wanted to go to uni of
B	yeah I've never been to the uni there
A	it is really nice
B	mm
A	erm
B	I don't I don't think you really put much thought into the course when you're choosing that I didn't realise like I didn't look at the courses and compare them and think oh I'd much prefer to do this than that
A	no I didn't
B	but I think when I went round to look I went when I went round looking at them
A	yeah it's just I've they say like when you're when you look round them you just get a feeling as soon as you're there like this is the one
B	yeah
A	oh did you?
B	so I applied to like all the unis on the coast like erm I applied to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they had like coats and scarves and stuff but it just it's it is it was nice I only had like four choices though to do Spanish and Chinese
B	I bet there weren't many at all
A	there was five but one of them was at
B	you wanted to go
A	no
B	and everyone was like it's your decision like yeah but
A	yeah I don't know how to make that decision and we were in the end we were like let's all just put them in the middle one of us picks one and we all just do that and we'll just go there and do the same course
B	yeah
A	and I was like maybe I should drop out
B	I wanted to do a gap year erm but it I I was the last year that got in on the cheap fees and if I did a gap year I'd have to have paid so so I was kind of the whole time I was like oh it's fine I'm going to go away then after a year I'll like think about it and then it was like oh no I'm going to pay more so
A	oh were you?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I'd probably I probably could've done my six month work six months travelling but in the end I just don't think I would've got back into like studying after that
B	no
A	I'd be like oh let's just keep travelling
B	it is really hard when you like stop studying and start again
A	yeah
B	I really
B	yeah
A	so you aren't completely like out of habit
B	no
A	you don't need to continue that sentence
B	yeah
A	no I think my dad was like because his sister my auntie she's basically been studying her whole life I swear she's done like loads of different things but now she's like a lecturer at Liverpool university so and he's done quite a lot of studying and but so he thinks that I should carry on studying no I think I'm done now I might consider doing a Masters so like if it's going to like benefit me in my work or whatever
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I remember finishing uni and just like wow I feel like I can do whatever I want to do now
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah same
A	but like just finished uni and then wait and then I think it was more hearing what result you had got rather than finishing uni
B	yeah that was
A	it was in that time it was still worrying if you'd actually done well enough
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh we we'd got them on a board
A	oh did you?
B	yeah they were like up so everyone could see them
A	oh no
B	it was really weird yeah
A	that's horrible I wouldn't have liked that
B	we all had to like go up to the uni and yeah it was really weird because I think that's like quite traditional I think
A	yeah we had that in first year where just for linguistics your like student number was on there
B	yeah
A	next to your like grade you got from particular exams we but we just had it online but erm so I was waiting for that then just got like a random phone call one day and it was like the head of department and I was like hello this is random because I knew it was a
B	oh
A	I'm sure you er you have done well so far though haven't you?
B	yeah I've got distinction so far so it's just just I need a distinction you know that little thing I think I'd be really really happy
A	yeah I'm sure you'll do well because
B	yeah
A	so I think you might even if you don't think it has like made a difference to it I think it has like
B	yeah I'm a little bit worried though because I've chosen to work and I was going to be like this is just like really obvious
unknown_female	any further tickets for
A	no I'm sure you'll be fine
B	yeah
A	like if you want us to proofread it or?
B	thank you
A	I got my auntie and uncle to read through my dissertation I was like I'm really sorry this is going to be really boring for you
B	yeah
A	ah that's nice
B	because she's just lost her job like she kind of she kind of knew it was happening because she's
A	oh no
B	yeah exactly so they they want to make her like support staff so obviously her pay would massively decrease but she also she teaches at
A	yeah
B	yeah I think you need to do the whole lot
A	and have a proofread
B	yeah
A	yeah I got because my auntie erm lectures in like oh what is it?
B	yeah
A	yeah I felt really bad like not giving the rest of my dissertation to my auntie but I didn't want her have to go through and waste all her time like
B	yeah
A	yeah and my sister did dance but she did like a she had to do like her own like own like data
B	so your younger sister she's how she's like you say she's nineteen? no so she's
A	no my youngest is
B	yeah so she's left school is she?
A	yeah she's
A	because she
A	I was like if it's what you want to do then don't care like what other people think
B	yeah
A	yeah we do
B	yeah
A	so she does practise and she does and people we pay her like only for the cost of like
B	the materials
A	the stuff she's using yeah so she can practise and every time she gets like a new colour I'll be like ah you can do my nails?
A	or like yeah but quite a lot of our friends as well use her so I think she is doing okay gets quite a lot of practice but I think she prefers doing like massages and stuff rather than nails
B	yeah
A	yeah she's twenty-one almost twenty-two now and she's not doing anything
B	yeah she's doing loads
B	and then there's like you and your twin
A	yeah
B	and what does your twin do?
A	well she's at a estate agents now
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	so
A	erm but she's next week or the week after she finishes there
B	and then she'll go to
A	yeah to do whatever she is to do
A	I don't really know my older sister she's erm housing needs officer so like people that need houses I guess are on benefits I'm not sure apply
B	how did she get into that?
A	I really don't know because she because of her degree in Psychology and Criminal Behaviour
B	yeah
A	and I don't know if she needs to do anything more than just
B	like qualification or apply I guess she's working in the right kind of sector to go into it
A	mm
B	yeah
A	that's all of us
B	it must be so nice being part of a big family
A	yeah it's weird like now I've moved out like the home being really quiet
B	yeah so how how many of your sisters live at home?
A	er three and my older sister's moving out end of December so only two yeah but that's quite a and like obviously where we've moved out my house is quiet I'm not used to being like it being that quiet like used to well walking in and it'll be like chaos
A	and like my boyfriend says I've got a really loud voice but I'm like I can't help it I think I've just like got used to talking over everyone because you literally have to shout to be heard
B	so there'll be two left
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah we we don't like why like my immediate family is quite small there's I've just got my brother but then we've always got family around
A	yeah

B	yeah yeah I think I think just having I don't know I didn't realise until quite late on in life that actually like spending time with family isn't a given it's and like you obviously your they're like blood relatives and you care about them but when you you just actively love them
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so you're like ah I'm going to continue seeing you this often but you don't because it's actually us that have to arrange it and like sort it out but

B	yeah cos then you you know that you always do it
A	mm
B	yeah
