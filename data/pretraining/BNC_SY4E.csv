A	my mum and er brother's fianc√©e went shopping for material for their wedding they're doing a festival wedding and they got some material with the erm
B	camper vans?

B	the first person's got to go through the star
A	and you get a

A	erm and then you can see all of these little squares so you can get double letter score triple letter score
B	yeah
A	triple word double word
B	yeah
A	erm yeah
B	and what about if somebody who goes oh that's not a word?
A	er then we have to decide between us I think do you really think either of us are going to have something that's not a word?
B	no well I'm not going to put anything
A	I don't have my Scrabble dictionary either so there's gonna be
B	okay
A	no cheating going on and no tactical blah blah
B	one two three four it's not like erm Countdown is it? cos we we don't get to choose whether you have
A	but there's also no time limit
B	one two three four five
B	six seven

B	mm
A	oops
B	are you seriously supposed to be able to like sit in the back of a car and play this?
B	oh
A	do you think possibly it was travel Scrabble when there were no cars?
A	I think it's more designed for being able to play on a train
B	okay or just take with you somewhere to play
B	mm that's quite good
A	I yeah I suspect it's more train travel Scrabble
B	mm
A	I also suspect that not all of the
A	never mind
A	oh
B	fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
A	have you got any double words in there? you've got a triple letter in there
B	triple letter yeah
A	did you count it?
B	yeah so that's fifteen sixteen seventeen

A	never mind
A	mm very good how many?
B	is that that one double?
A	yeah you
A	yes yes you do erm but the double letter scores or triple letter scores only count the first time you put the word down yeah

B	who do you normally play against?
A	my mum who normally beats me

A	despite the fact that you
B	mm mm cheers
A	mm mm
B	mm
B	no as far as I know I'm staying on it can't see why they'd have reason to change it
A	well no but as you say
B	no yeah you never know
A	yeah
B	well I can't see why they would though
A	mm
B	erm so yeah I probably should get more invested in it I don't feel like feel like I'm just kind of maybe when I've I'm working full-time it'll be a bit more
A	yeah I was gonna say you probably will do
B	involved I don't feel
A	you don't have to be that involved
B	well just doing it afternoons you just be a bit like mm
A	mm
B	it's two hours a day it's only eight hours a week
A	mm
B	but and you always like when you're pairing if there's one doing morning and one doing afternoon it's always the morning one that seems more
A	mm which?
B	like if you had a morning
A	in other schools in other schools I kind of get it because you have in other schools you'll have three hours in the morning and an hour and a half in the afternoon whereas at
B	yeah so it's stayed
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	mm mm
B	mm mm

A	that's you're doing really well
B	mm mm mm
A	that's inappropriate two three three four five ten
B	on that note I might have another pastry

A	oh okay
B	mm
B	mm
A	have you got a dictionary under there?

A	just?
B	that was one er that was er more active
B	where they weren't just like lying like that mm
A	he hasn't passed his CELTA
B	erm
A	hasn't passed
B	he said he wants to come back as an activity he said he wants to come back as an activity leader
A	mm
B	and I looked at him and he said but I said no
B	and I said have you told him it's gonna be a
B	which
A	yeah
B	and then he looked at me like well has that been decided?
B	I said because I don't think he'll want to
A	mm
A	oh
B	oh
A	okay mm mm mm
A	eight six
B	what did you get?
A	er what's three times eight? sixteen
B	isn't it? that's word
A	it's a triple word score so I've got four six seven eight
B	sixteen twenty-four
B	and then that one
A	and then this one which is er
A	but I've also got a double letter score so thirty-three
B	oh does that count both ways?
A	huh yes it does oh right so I've got
B	no but you did that one already didn't you? no? no so six seven eight nine nine times three
A	no no no right no oh I can do that twenty-seven
B	twenty-seven and then
A	and then
B	twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty thirty-one thirty-two thirty-three thirty-four thirty-five thirty-six
A	thirty-six wow yes
B	mm that's not bad is it?
A	no it's pretty good
B	yeah
A	yeah? yeah that's right so it's fifty-sixty-seventy-eighty yeah wahoo
A	so what are you gonna teach next week when you have to go back to teaching all the time?
B	don't know yet cos
A	oh
B	but there's me and
A	mm
B	so there's an int and a
A	and what's
B	pre-int I think
A	oh
B	there's an int a pre-int and then it depends whether
A	mm
B	but I know that she hates intermediate
A	but her her nice boys have moved up
B	and then if she goes to pre-int
A	yeah
B	oh it's a bit of a lame move to say I'm I'm really sick of doing elementary so I'm gonna do pre-int which is all the same people that I was
B	but yeah she does like to have the students that she likes in the class doesn't she?
A	yeah she gets yeah I'm sure half the reason that all the pre-int class was just a bit crap was cos she just got rid of people cos she didn't like them any more
B	yeah yeah
A	or she didn't wanna teach them mm
B	mm
A	yeah I'm a bit pre-inted out actually so long so long
B	mm
A	maybe my brain will kick in after I've finished my coffee
A	it's not
A	phew
B	four five six seven eight sixteen
A	sixteen
B	erm
A	sixteen six seven mm yeah you've got very clever words as opposed to
A	and then when I was looking at this I was looking at table but I like fable better yeah but it's also quite nice to get good words you think oh that's a good word
B	yeah but they've got a higher score
A	even if it's not particularly high scoring like a word with seven letters or a clever word
B	mm
A	mm sorry not many it's quite hard
A	oh damn it
B	er I think she's probably going to yeah she's doing mornings of it this week and then
A	oh is she?
B	yeah she's feeling quite a bit more chilled about it
A	yeah she seems pretty chilled doesn't she?
B	mm
A	I don't know how long
B	think he's already said that it's hard work
A	I think it's not that it's hard work I don't think they're very nice to work for as far as I can work out
B	mm
A	and er not many pubs are to be fair
B	mm
A	but I I get the impression that the
B	mm well yeah that's what you get when people aren't
A	it's pretty busy although it's pretty solidly busy as well though and people aren't
B	mm
A	mm
B	well when people aren't happy they aren't very good are they?
A	yeah
B	when they don't get training
A	yeah
A	er four five
B	seven
A	so do you reckon I'll get an invite to the Christmas party? or do you think I'll be off the list?
A	mm especially as nobody ever goes as well like
A	oh they didn't go in the summer? oh okay
B	no because at the
B	they're they're
A	do you wanna say it and see? try and put it down?
B	no it's er it's not that much anyway so er mm I would quite like to have some consonants
A	ah yeah I'd quite like some vowels
B	oh swap you do a blind swap
B	you're gonna swap one?
A	yeah vowel for a consonant yeah
B	is that in the rules?
A	er no
A	but we don't have any rules look it's so old there's no rules with it
B	mm
A	yeah I dunno
B	mm
A	mm mm again just looking at there and thinking I wonder what I could fit in there
A	cool
B	cool
B	two three four five six twelve
B	one two three four
A	mm
B	again with the bells
B	oh yeah
A	feels like a holiday game I miss going on holiday and having no telly or the internet and just like
B	yeah well that's right
A	I know
B	yeah
A	I don't know how he would react
B	my mm yeah my brother stayed in this amazing erm it was in
A	mm
B	really really old fashioned American style like I think it's like an old Winnebago type thing
A	oh wow
B	huge er and it looked like a big tin can it's metal
B	maybe yeah yeah
A	that's what it reminds me of
B	yeah could be like that beautifully done out absolutely
A	in like Independence Day or something like that?
B	stunningly beautiful
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	mm that's an interesting
B	seriously I took all vowels
A	but then I can't find anywhere to put it
B	mm
A	and I remember that I do better and earn more points when I'm looking at the board it's not actually kind of relating it all together
B	mm
A	I'm not sure
B	yeah
A	cinders from the fire?
B	yeah you can because of The Cinder Path I remember reading it's I dunno it's a book called The Cinder Path
A	what's The Cinder Path? oh okay
B	it was erm who was that? oh she's a female author she wrote loads she's quite old she wrote loads of books and they're all really depressing
A	Maya Angelou?
B	no they're like love stories
A	oh okay
B	set in I dunno Yorkshire or really bleak places where the women are always really hard done by I remember reading one called The Cinder Path and yeah it's just really abused women who've
A	oh god
B	really just quite erm
A	mm
A	twenty-two
B	mm
A	it's not that high scoring though is it? erm
B	no I read them when I was about fifteen I think
A	yeah
B	can't remember what she was called
A	I'm puzzling over what to do about books for
B	it might've been something Bradford something
A	oh sounds familiar but I can't think
B	you know
A	oh okay
B	Taylor Bradford Taylor something mm
A	but it's really slow and doesn't work very well
B	mm
A	and then books are quite heavy and I also wouldn't want anyone to steal the tablet
B	yeah yeah
A	wow I've got some interesting letters oh look at that
A	anyway I knew loads of letters with Z in when I played a lot
B	thirty-two
A	thirty-two? wow
B	twenty-eight
A	oh yay
B	a hundred a hundred and
A	a hundred and thirteen to me a hundred and twelve to you
A	oh right I remember what to do with this huh oh that's an exciting word where can I put that?
B	oh
A	yes yes yes yes wow look at that
B	that is E L isn't it? not A
A	axle sorry? axle like car axle
B	mm
A	yeah
B	L E
A	oh no do you wanna find the dictionary I think axel E L might be a name
B	I think it is yeah I think that is right no I think it
A	I don't know that is a good question actually can get the dictionary and find out
A	you what?
B	my washing smells he's just sitting in the garden I think the cat might be ill they like to go away when they're ill
A	yeah they do sometimes
B	mm kind of hard to know isn't it? can't really tell you
A	oh did you go to the erm that seminar that Longman did and get a dictionary?
B	yeah this was free
A	yeah yeah same
B	and it's got er I dunno
A	yeah
B	that never seemed to work or something
A	yeah
A	I use the dictionary a lot actually A X what is it?
B	mm
A	oh that's okay
B	bar connecting two wheels
A	that's fine I'll just do that instead then but oh no I can't do that oh damn
B	sorry that was a really good idea
A	and there's no there's no just A X is there?
B	no A X E
A	must be A X E
B	there's not an awful lot of
A	no
A	A X E L
B	like Axl Rose
A	oh yes
B	access axe
A	yeah axiom that's a nice one
B	axiomatic
B	that's it excellent stuff
A	no you can't that's not in the
B	yeah
A	what? why?
B	I don't know it must be something about being a learner dictionary
A	I suppose
B	because it also had like a name of a famous person or something it's like a dictionary and look Axis of Evil the phrase used by US president George Bush
A	Axis of Evil oh yeah I'd understand yeah I'd go for that yeah but Axminster what's that? Axminster?
B	type of carpet no not the place type of carpet
A	no but erm oh is it actually a type of carpet
B	but with a capital letter surely you can't have?
A	but Axminster Carpets is the one that's based in Devon isn't it and went bankrupt? and they had Axminster Carpets had erm a an er factory or plant whatever by Buckfast Abbey
B	this seems to be but dictionaries don't normally have
A	well it is a learner's dictionary isn't it?
B	yeah that's why I think it's different
A	yeah
B	mm
A	not for advanced learners okay oh damn it's still my turn okay oh
A	mm
B	oh I don't know can you do that?
A	well
A	I'm pretty sure it is but I just wanna check it might be the sort of word that's not in the learner dictionary though not secondary school yes it is in the dictionary
B	I don't think I've got any other dictionary
A	have you not?
B	I suppose if you were playing it really seriously you'd have to agree on
A	there you go
B	hod
A	hod
B	yeah that's like a farming tool isn't it?
A	it's a stick with a thing on that you carry bricks on
B	oh course it is yeah
A	yeah
B	no but I've heard of one
A	I hadn't I it's only cos I studied this German photographer for my German A level and his idea was self-portraits and they there was a guy with a hod
B	oh I've definitely heard of it
A	erm oh six seven fourteen
B	mm
A	erm twenty
B	yeah I really want some more letters
B	oh that should be a word it sounds so much like it should be a word
B	vaunt
A	oh it does sound like a word doesn't it?
B	V A U N T er doesn't it? it's like vault and haunt vaunt
B	to haunt somebody in a vault
A	we could always start playing like the
A	I was watching Never Mind the Buzzcocks the other day and they had Lethal Bizzle I don't really know who he is but he's invented a word dench and he's trying to get it in the dictionary in fact it might even be in the dictionary by now
B	oh dench sounds very er dunno
A	doesn't sound like the sort of word I would say
B	that's so dench man
A	yeah yeah that's exactly what it is
A	got a French word can I have a French word?
B	no
A	oh dear mm
B	mm I haven't
B	I have heard it yeah can't remember it
A	mm
A	what?
A	you can't have vaunt
B	ah Ss are great aren't they?
A	yeah
B	wish I had some
A	they're also good to save to the end as well where you can like fill in words or
B	yeah just keep
A	yeah
A	yeah I know
A	it's getting quite hard
B	it's just lack of kind of inspiration I think when you've got high scoring letters you're like oh I want to use that in a certain place
A	it's also but it's
B	so you can kind of think of something to do
A	yeah but the more letters you put down the harder it is to find a place to put or the more words you've got kind of closes up and there's not so many places to put your words
B	mm
A	did
A	mm good good
B	it's nothing it oh it's double letter oh double letter there
B	two four five
A	yeah
B	six seven eight eight
A	yeah
B	get some goodies
A	it doesn't really help me it's a good one to put down but it's not very helpful
B	not that's why I did it
B	cos other things I thought that could potentially be helpful
B	mm
A	er mm oh oh oh oh oh oh yes
B	oh nice one
A	that's good isn't it?
B	what is under?
A	just a double I think so eight
B	oh nice
A	yes
B	also means there's no way of using that bit
B	yeah but not in one move
A	no
B	no
A	twenty-eight erm cor that's a lot isn't it?
B	forty
A	yeah
B	mm cor you're really happy when you're winning aren't you? you're really instantly depressed when you're losing you're like oh you're really good at this you're gonna beat me aren't you?
B	mm
A	two four six seven
B	mm huh ah that would be a brilliant word
A	yeah?
B	keep seeing ones I haven't got like half the letters for just thought that would be amazing that word
B	wheeze
A	wheeze?
B	mm
A	is that with an H?
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	mm
A	can you spell it without an H?
B	no
A	can you not?
B	pretty sure not no
A	wonder if it's an
B	I don't know
B	I think it's the way I say it it's like I write it with an S because I don't like Z
A	possibly that's the reason why
B	I can write it with an S
A	mm
B	mm
B	might be worth doing that anyway no because mm
B	I'm just gonna have to do it cos I just want some points
A	go for it
B	I don't think it's very erm clever but
A	yeah it's good
B	is it?
A	it's a double yeah
B	double word eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen twenty-six
A	twenty-six oh oh oh
B	mm
A	no I don't mind if you I I don't mind if you beat me I'm just get annoyed when I can't remember how to play well
A	I've kind of remembered now
B	oh you're er you're good at this
A	cos my brain's going what?
A	you're doing all these things like oh yeah
A	that's how you get points I remember now
B	oh man I have got seven vowels oh I was going to do exactly that well not exactly that actually
A	not
A	oh
B	is it an R?
A	no it's not
B	oh that's a shame
A	er four five six er six
B	eighteen
A	thanks
A	er fifty
B	yeah do it with him
A	actually I could probably just get
B	mm
A	I'll do all the spelling
B	it's I would be okay until they get to algebra
A	do they learn algebra?
B	well at some point yeah
A	I don't remember that what er?
B	secondary school
A	really?
B	X Y Z X Y three Xs two Ys
A	oh god well I'm totally gonna leave it to
B	that stuff I was alright at the time but now
A	I can't even I remember doing long division in primary school no clue how to do it now
B	yeah I know
A	absolutely no idea
B	but that's just stupid cos there's such a thing as a calculator
A	yeah
B	no point to learning long division any more I don't think
A	yeah I I do something that looks like long division but I really don't think it is I think it's just me making it up
B	does it work?
A	er sometimes
B	yeah I've got seven vowels
A	huh
A	seven vowels? are you joking?
B	no I'm not joking no and it's not even like I've got all of them
B	no I haven't even
A	oh dear
B	I haven't even got all of the different vowels but I've got seven vowels
A	why don't you swap one from the bag?
B	are you allowed to do that?
A	well we can make up the rules ourselves
B	no it's alright I can
A	okay
B	I'm sure I can use them somehow
A	okay are you gonna get a new Christmas tree this year or are you just gonna keep your brown one?
B	no I'll get a new one
A	yeah
B	it's so sad though isn't it? I mean look what amazing condition it's in
A	yeah
B	apart from turning a bit brown which I quite like in autumn
A	it's quite recent though isn't it? the brown?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but that's quite nice cos it's matching autumn
A	yeah it's lovely yeah quite surprised I quite I'm quite enjoying autumn
B	I like autumn too
A	I always I always think I don't like it but now that it's here it's quite nice
B	yeah I the worst bit I like autumn and I like autumn going into winter
A	yeah
B	the worst bit is when you come back after Christmas and you're like seriously it's still winter
B	but yeah that's true
A	in a hot country and come back in February all nice and suntanned
A	yeah maybe you should
B	mm
A	although knowing knowing
A	yeah
A	so maybe it's just a case of getting rid of some of your vowels
B	mm so that I can get something else
A	yep
B	there's only so many vowels you can get off at one get rid of at one time though
A	yeah
B	okay
A	is the one that you could use
B	would be useful
A	it's probably the one I've got
B	how annoying oh no it's the same same same okay let's just have a quick check
B	mm and if I had two of them instead of having
A	oh oh oh oh oh oh
B	okay
B	how have you done that again?
A	it's a really good word it's one of those ones I wouldn't even be bothered if it wasn't very many points
A	oh that's a
A	six
B	how did I manage to miss all
B	please don't give me vowels
B	no
A	four five six erm oh sorry
B	dunno
A	mm
B	don't know
A	mm
B	I wouldn't think so
A	no
B	especially as
A	oh yeah that's true yeah
B	and I wouldn't
A	no
A	no not at all so
B	mm?
A	so
B	mm apart from if he does a split shift
A	mm
B	he gets the bus but then that shows that he can get the bus unless he starts really early didn't say that though cos I think she'd be really tired then
A	but actually they're only in
B	it is if there is one early enough he might start really early
A	erm they go oh yeah if he does breakfast I suppose he'd start you wouldn't start any earlier than seven I don't think
