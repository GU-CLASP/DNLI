C	yeah yeah
B	and I got my trainers on so that

C	yeah
B	you know it's not a good time to have it done
C	no it's not is it?
B	erm
C	yeah
B	and I have thought about going back to the doctors and
C	yeah
B	you know look I'd like another X-ray cos I think it is getting
C	worse
B	it is getting worse
C	they'll start giving you cortisone injections won't they shortly?
B	somebody I know has just had some I think I mentioned it
C	yeah?
B	erm
C	yeah
B	twelve months
C	yeah
B	somebody at work's had them done and it's not made it any it's worse now because
C	it er yeah
B	it you've you've
C	yeah yeah
B	so
C	but that's like buying extra time though innit you know?
B	so
C	if er if you get an appointment for the operation and you have to get cortisone injections and they have to wait five six months that would be that wouldn't be so bad would it?
B	no
C	but er I don't know what the waiting list is up up at
B	it's it's er it's all this ifs and buts at the moment with me isn't it?
C	yeah
B	you know
C	no
B	no news on the house
C	you'd have thought there'd have been more interest wouldn't you at this time of the year?
B	you know there've been nothing since the two in the first week of the holidays

B	yeah
C	if they want a new kitchen done or change the
B	yeah
C	that's what they do
B	yeah I don't know whether I dunno I I genuinely don't know whether to put a new floor down in the kitchen
C	what a wood floor?
B	a wood floor down in the kitchen
C	well I don't know

B	he's taken both of them
C	he's took both of them
B	no he's taken

C	yeah
B	and the only person really who can do it is me
C	yeah yeah
B	you know?
C	you haven't?
B	and I should have done but I haven't because I don't want I don't I feel I'd get that it'll be that rejection and it'll be like
C	yeah
B	no
C	yeah
B	when really they could make such a difference by saying yeah okay we'll do it for three years
C	yeah

C	yeah
B	that's very
C	they're a very nice couple too they're really nice
B	yeah yeah
C	I think I had
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah oh I was
C	oh I watched that this morning
B	and I watched the football last night and
C	oh did you? yeah
B	which was good it was alright
C	well that was still on when we got home
B	yeah
C	on ITV two
B	yeah but it was so that was that was that was good
C	that was good as it? yeah?
B	they had some good stuff on there erm
C	was she?
B	doing this four foot by two foot board
C	wow
B	and the teacher said you need to do it larger and I said your teacher I said to
C	no
B	I said and
C	no
B	have a piece of board so I said four foot by two foot is is the maximum size
C	yeah
B	and when I you know and when I consider that piece of board that I bought her two pieces of board a piece of MDF which was two foot by four foot and a piece of plywood two foot by four foot that was that was nearly thirty quid
C	was it? crikey
B	no it was already cut
C	it was already cut was it?
B	at Homebase
C	yeah
B	and now it looks like they're not doing their sheet material any more Homebase
C	aren't they?
B	they've had the saw taken out the big saw taken out
C	have they?
B	and you're thinking well I
C	yeah
B	you know if they want you want if they want you to do something larger then they provide you with the like cos they all have it easier to get move it about
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and it'll be a lot cheaper
C	yeah
B	so she went oh okay so she was doing that she was doing that and I I watched the the Villa game
B	right? that's not Liverpool Station London that is Liverpool Lime Street Station Liverpool I says but which makes me think if you can get a direct change from
C	yeah
B	because er and I said and I had the
C	yeah
B	I enjoyed it so maybe we could go on the train to Liverpool
C	yeah
B	oh really? and I went yeah so I I checked it out on the thing
C	yeah?
B	and eighteen pound return
C	oh
B	it depends on when you of
C	yeah
B	when you go
C	yeah
B	and when you book but the problem being is you can have a direct only one train
C	yeah?
B	five hours thirty minutes
C	oh right
B	or you can have a train where you swap twice
C	yeah
B	Leeds Liverpool
C	wow
B	still the same
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	in the hope that they're actually
B	connected
C	on time or
B	yeah
C	whatever
B	yeah
C	I can just imagine you getting off a train and the other one is pulling out
B	yeah
C	that often happen don't it?
B	so I suppose if it's a little bit late and whatever
C	yeah
B	so so it's like
C	yeah
B	but in the car
C	yeah
B	on a tank of petrol easily
C	yeah
B	and that's like sixty quid
B	so forty let's
B	you drive don't you?
C	yeah yeah
B	you drive so
C	the only problem with driving is is parking up you know?
B	yeah I mean the the hotel that we stayed in you got free parking with that
C	oh did you? yeah
B	mm
C	and lots of people were paying that was only a that was only a Premier Inn and it was very nice it were a
B	when you're sleeping there
C	yeah
B	they might as well put the price on the hotel room that's the way they do it
C	well of course it is yeah
B	yeah well see well this hotel well I a lot of hotels that are in like in the city centre don't like the Premier like the Premier in
C	yeah
B	which is next door to
C	yeah
B	you use
C	do you? yeah
B	and you get a ticket
C	oh you get a ticket do you? it's like
B	yeah
C	and you got your free
B	yeah
C	but if you if you parked there and then went walking out and
B	yeah
C	but you gotta shop there and well
B	the cheapest the cheapest place really after four o'clock or after is it two o'clock? is
C	is it? yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah?
C	that is mega expensive yeah
B	mega expensive
C	you'd have thought these car parks had been run by the council so they could make the money and not these big car park people wouldn't you?
B	oh it's like all council things isn't it?
C	it's all
B	the reason they don't do
C	shipped out innit? yeah
B	the reason they don't cos they've gotta keep upkeep them haven't they?
C	yeah they have yeah yeah
B	you know why aren't there any council houses any more as such?
C	well that's true yeah
B	why is it all private?
C	yeah
B	or going in that direction
C	well that is innit? yeah
B	yeah
C	but they sold off all the council houses didn't they?
B	well they gave you that right see that's where
C	that was
B	cos they allowed you to buy your council house
C	yeah
B	which was fine
C	yeah
B	because it meant that people the working class got their foot on the ladder
C	yeah that's right
B	who were
C	yeah
B	for for the majority and knew they would have to continue working then
C	yeah
B	cos they they've got a mortgage so
C	yeah
B	going on strike and stuff like that
C	was yeah
B	it's gonna be a strange election
C	it's gonna be a weird one innit?
B	it is gonna be a strange election
C	I mean they're all worried now it case the
B	you could see him doing it in
C	well I think a I think a lot a lot of er but I mean that used to be true blue
B	yeah but he's only but he's a he isn't
C	yeah
B	or are not bias
C	yeah or aren't racist
B	oh
C	oh dear
B	there is some there is something about there is something about I think see I
C	oh right yeah
B	because you'll have the
C	yeah
B	backing Labour et cetera
C	yeah
B	so therefore you've got Labour will owe them something
C	yeah
B	so they might give them the
C	yeah
B	Scotland again or
C	no
B	because they get too much and the and apparently there was some
C	yeah
B	because the deal that they did
C	yeah that's right and education in Scotland
B	you know
C	you can go to university in Scotland for nothing if you live up there
B	yeah
C	and you have to pay for it here
B	yeah
C	er who's who's going to get married? someone's come coming over er one of
B	yeah
C	to be education and they call them you know it's a lot of people are paying nine thousand quid innit now? three thousand a year?
B	no it's nine thousand a year
C	nine thousand a year is it? that's a lot of money innit? who's got that?
B	no but you just have a student loan
C	yeah and then you have to pay it back er talking student loans erm
B	yeah
C	but we now got this application form
C	yeah
B	I don't know don't know
C	under twenty thousand a year something like that you don't have to pay it off soon as they get over that then you have to start paying it off
B	yeah
C	but that's a shame cos I mean all these people are in debt after getting educated and if they can't get a job well
B	well
B	get a job
C	well most
B	they're no better off
C	a lot of graduates cos there there was an article
C	is it? yeah? yeah if they can get a job
B	if you go and work for the likes of Lidl and Aldi as a graduate you're on forty grand
C	are you? wow
B	but they expect you to you're there all the time and
C	yeah
B	they're expecting you to do everything in the store
C	yeah yeah but they've
B	you know you do
C	only got a few jobs they've only got an X amount of jobs them sort of people and there's loads and loads of graduates without one
B	yeah it I mean that that is the problem that is the problem
C	mm oh it sounds
B	wind's picking up
C	the wind's getting up but that's was lovely yesterday after the rain

C	yeah just nip to the loo
B	the M5 goes all the way down there

B	so I was having this conversation and she went will you stop being silly now please?
B	and then she said something and I went said have you missed me? I have yeah I missed your smile I missed tormenting you
B	and it and she didn't like that
C	didn't she?
B	no no I just and I thought oh
C	she's got no sense of humour then
B	and I
C	no
B	yeah
C	she's too posh?
C	oh right
B	quiet spoken or something dunno and then there was there was some she said something I said oh something about the north and she says about oh it's all flat caps and everything and then I
B	and I text back oh that reminds me I must get my flat cap out
B	so dunno did you see erm Escape to the Country?
C	yes that was
B	there was there was a
C	oh I didn't seen that one I mean
B	where there's a couple where they've been looking they've been together fifteen years
B	she's just retired she just retired from the job she was doing and and er was hating it because she wasn't seeing anybody
C	oh right
B	well you have to go if you you have to go out to see people
C	well of course you do
B	if you're retired and you know you're retired then you find things to do
C	yeah
B	you know
C	did she? oh
B	right? and they have a budget or something like six hundred thousand
C	oh wow
B	so you get plenty you know and like
C	yeah
B	they want certain things in the house et cetera and er
C	yeah
B	and they must he said we counted over a thousand houses that we looked at and didn't like any of them
C	what?
C	well what do they live in now then? er?
B	and it's like
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah we you know that Rightmove place on on the net? we I think
B	the EPC
C	the EPC and all got between between er D and F they're not every efficient at all because they're okay in the in the summer when it's hot outside cos they're nice and cool but you can't heat them up so good until or everything get hot
B	is that the is that reason? because mine's a D
C	yours is a D?
B	alright mine's a D
C	I thought yours was
B	mine's a D
C	I think ours is D too innit? we got the same as you we got the same EPC as you
B	and the reason mine is at that level is because of my boiler even though my boiler is
C	yeah
B	brand new
C	yeah
B	it's because Calor Gas is not
C	it's expensive
B	it no it's not
C	oh right
B	if it was oil
C	yeah
B	it would have a better reading it's that calorific
C	yeah well they don't like that they don't like the the coal burner or the wood burner and they put our I mean they said if you had underfloor er insulation that
B	yeah
C	would be okay we have got underfloor insulation
B	yeah
C	total idiots and that's there for ten years innit you can't change it
B	yeah
C	this bloke come round and he walk walked around every wall is insulated in this house
B	mm
C	every single wall
B	it's never a cold house
C	no
B	all down to it's all down to that that cos
C	yeah it's all down to that
B	you know when you consider that all my walls are
C	yeah
B	the new build has got the right thickness and thin
C	yeah
B	the loft has got vermiculate in although it's not the thickness but vermiculite is as good
C	yeah it is yeah
B	as the stuff
C	yeah
B	but you can buy you can get insulation that isn't that thick that is only that thick which is just as good
C	yeah you can yeah
B	half the thickness therefore innit?
C	yeah
B	right
C	well I I think I think the bloke was absolutely mental he didn't know what he was talking about he was there for about three minutes and that was it you know? then he gave you a
B	yeah but it'll be double it cost you though didn't it sixty quid or something like that
C	yeah yeah
B	no I I don't know what I'm gonna do
C	no you're in a quandary really ain't you?
B	I'm not dropping it any more
C	no
B	it it's got a range that if anybody wants it there is a range there that people can come in at
C	yeah yeah
B	and when you see what's on the market
C	yeah
B	it's where it should be
C	yeah
B	I bumped into a
C	yeah?
B	in the village
C	oh did you? yeah
