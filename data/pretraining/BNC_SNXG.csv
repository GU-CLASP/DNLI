A	whatever and it's like
B	surely it gets a lot better than this
A	yeah yeah yeah
A	that's cool
B	it could be a good song I I think
A	yeah if if the er chorus wasn't
B	and just
A	the chorus is great
B	this this whole noise is just like
A	and it stops weirdly
A	I don't even know
B	that's good
A	yeah it is
A	I love it cos when she came in she was like is this Blake Shelton? I was like no it's not Blake Shelton this isn't country music I do I do have Blake Shelton on my laptop though I think that's why she thinks that it was
B	I have no idea who he is though
A	he's just a country singer but er I
B	I er I don't think I'd mind it but after a while I think it's like
A	I like it cos I do like the little er I do like the little
B	does it? is it really funny when you sing it?
A	er it's really funny cos she she like
A	that's what it's like
B	that's exactly er
A	I was like yep that's what they sound like she was like laughing
B	to a T
A	and then I went to my er
A	American
A	and that's that's the southern southern like southern American
B	why have you gotta say nice white rice though?
A	it was just he it's just he's just a funny teacher he wasn't doing it like purposely you should see you should've seen his impression of er er Arnold Schwarzenegger he's a crazy man
A	and er mm?
B	was that funny?
A	yeah it was so funny
A	and he started going I I don't know what
B	did he not just say I'll be back?
A	no he didn't say I'll be back cos he had his gun and he started shooting like
A	he had his
B	you can't say I'll be back
A	exactly so I don't know I've forgotten what he said but he did he did it was so
B	did he do er
A	so funny
B	hasta la vista?
A	no it wasn't hasta la vista can't remember what it was
B	that's like two of the
A	I know yeah it wasn't it wasn't like a famous catchphrase it was just his accent
B	ah
A	with with but I can't remember what he said but then he just started like
A	but it was funny cos he's like erm I think I've probably said this before he's like a middle-aged white man and he's originally from America but he's spent a lot of his like like I think he like from the age of like five to like thirteen or something in Jamaica so he can speak like the Jamaican Creole
A	just I it's just weird you cos you would
B	cultural appropriation
A	I know yeah yeah
A	but he did live there so he did just and especially as a kid you definitely pick up the accents as a kid
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so er it was funny
B	cool story bro
A	fine I won't tell any more
A	cool story bro

B	it was alright
A	it's yeah it's fine that bit's fine this bit is a bit dubious though apparently his mum
B	mm
A	has said that
A	cos if my parents had said that to me I
A	yeah he said yeah
B	but that must mean that he thinks that's okay
A	I know that's what I mean that's why I was like not being funny but is he not doing anything about this then? is cos

A	so I'd get up and I'd go to the kitchen and obviously her bedroom was next to the kitchen and there she was and then I'd have to
A	and the thing is yeah yeah she
B	hate them people
A	and the problem is I mean it's not it well actually it's not it's kinda good at least she never expected me to speak she just wanted to tell you her story or something or whatever happening with her
B	mm

B	I dunno
A	so yeah the lightning rod
A	it
B	sad
A	no it wasn't that bad it wasn't
A	I the funny thing is last year it would've really like bothered me like last year would've been like
B	what? now do you just like not care?
A	this year he was just like ha ha ha
B	ha ha ha
A	it wasn't it wasn't like that it
B	no
A	but I could laugh about it this year it was like it was like yeah I can shrug it off this year and be like people are people
B	why?
A	just I guess just just my mood in general like this year this year's been so this term
A	it is it is weird
B	so weird that your eyes had to be weird as as you said that
B	as you said like so many times
A	yes I am up in the morning
B	mm
A	last year I was it was to the point where I just it was just like no I'm not gonna go in today
A	to that to that extreme
A	yeah to that extreme it was like I can't back to sleep whereas now I'm like yep up in the morning got my music on I'm in a good mood
B	mm good
A	yeah
B	you said something along those lines
A	it wasn't it wasn't you were there
B	well you
A	it was you helped more than you know
B	yeah there we go then yeah that's the same thing
A	you were there but you weren't there though
B	no there as in I'm like there for you

B	just paraphrasing like you did for Richard Hammond when we were
A	yeah I guess
B	well don't know what you mean then
A	mm?
B	I didn't do owt
A	see that's why I was like yeah you you're gonna say that you're gonna think that
B	but I didn't do anything
A	yeah you did
B	pretty sure I didn't
A	pretty sure you did
B	pretty sure I didn't
A	pretty sure I get to decide that
B	pretty sure I do as well
A	no
B	joint decision
A	why would you get to decide it?
A	you won't get to decide it though
B	but I I
A	yeah it's cos it's not like it's not like doing something in particular
A	cos you haven't
B	you haven't actually done anything just making you feel better
A	no it's not like a physical act like it's not it's not like that it was just it was just stuff
B	cool I'll keep doing
A	yeah I know
B	no I'll do more
A	oh see then but then I don't want it to be forced
B	no it's not forced but it's just like
A	cos then it's like this is unnatural
B	no it's then it's just like I wanna do it because erm I get noticed
A	see no then no
A	all you want is cos you get noticed
B	but then what
A	what do you mean you don't know if it's good?
B	like I've had no positive reinforcement
A	you have I've just thanked you
B	but er what for?
A	so?
A	I can only think I
B	it's like say if I made tea but I made it in different ways each time and then
A	oh okay
B	you gave me no feedback at all I wouldn't know which one was good
A	I'd just be like keep yeah but keep going
B	but then I'd I'd just be making sporadic teas
B	mm I just don't understand
A	no because
B	remember things?
A	the most recent the most recent one I can remember
B	what was it?
A	you you focus too much on it and I don't I don't wanna say it
B	yeah come on I just wanna I wanna know what the stand-out point

B	mm?
A	it's all like living abroad for a few months

A	some of them it goes from like
B	I'm sure they pay you enough that you could
A	I
B	well yeah
A	how comfortably
A	but I have to speak to I did tell you I was thinking of doing a master's didn't I? wasn't I? didn't I? didn't I tell you that?
B	sorry?
B	sorry I I got a text from my dad saying that cognac is absolutely beautiful

B	yeah I know
A	erm I did I
B	er journalist in

B	it was
A	no well after
B	oh you didn't tell me then
A	no er yeah I did
B	yeah no cos you didn't tell me you didn't tell me
A	but after I spoke to you I realised
B	you didn't tell me
A	I realised I'd probably have to apply for a lot of other places
A	what?
B	mm?
A	mm? did you
B	mm?
A	did you hear what I said? I don't really know what you want me to explain
B	yeah after after
A	I I realised that I probably should apply for a lot of other places rather than just like one
B	oh okay
A	it's publishing I'm applying for publishing
B	publishing that's the one
A	why? you haven't been telling people have you?
B	no
A	cos I'm not telling people so don't tell people
B	not telling people? why not?
A	yeah
A	and I don't have to explain to people
B	why? are you scared of failure?
A	course I am who's not?
B	to be fair I
A	yeah so yeah so don't blab it blab it this is I'm telling you
B	as as soon as I get home
A	so this is
B	mm you might need something
B	oh well there you go
A	but it's at like someone's house
B	that'll be fun
A	but yeah so they're like the ones that I'm gonna apply for if I don't get like the master's there's so much to like there's so much
B	but you will get the loan
A	until
B	no but like
A	mm
B	erm but like it will be ready for this next year
A	yeah I know I know yeah yeah yeah
B	cos they like they sent emails out
A	I know
B	erm from
A	oh they've done it that's nice of them
B	erm
A	we didn't get any information about it
B	well er did I tell that I I was the one who sent sent these emails? because erm
A	look at you
B	please disregard that last email
B	and I said and then they were they were saying erm I think they were just trying to persuade me to erm apply to a master's or a PHD
A	right yeah to
B	erm which I eventually did
B	but not as a
A	to be fair they did give me a letter but I didn't read it because like
B	you didn't read it?
A	yeah cos they were like it was about master's and at the time I was like no way in hell am I doing a master's
B	you could've at least read it
A	no
B	reread it
A	oh
A	when did I get it?
A	there's no way I can do one there
B	absolutely no way
A	absolutely no way I'm living in
B	so where else are you
B	I remember you saying
A	do you mind do you mind driving to
B	okay then
A	I know yeah okey-dokey well that's where
B	is it?
A	yeah ah ha ha you didn't even know
B	ah ha ha oh I'm sorry I don't know
A	you didn't even know did you?
A	don't even know I do wahey erm
B	so jealous
A	it it'd be fine I don't even care about like where it is or what the uni is but I mean er it'd be best if I was in
B	mm
A	so but I'd love to live in
B	but everything's very erm
A	yeah it's true yeah but
B	so
A	I just think they probably they have probably better contacts in
B	mm?
A	and there's probably like better people to speak to and stuff who don't wanna travel to
B	yeah maybe
A	but I'd love to live in
B	well er I think I'm sure if it came down to it
A	and I'd love to go to
B	well
A	I'd love to go to those national parks but
B	yeah so
A	I know yeah or actual stuff so yeah obviously I er I imagine
A	well but the but the
B	no but I'd just do it
A	I know yeah I will I will but I don't think I can get someone to help me whereas I
B	a lot of them are like that
A	mm it's nice
B	I think it's just cos the the workload on them I guess is less
A	yeah
B	they do one here one there sort of thing
A	yeah yeah so it's quite nice
B	yeah
A	yep
B	did I tell you erm
A	no I didn't
A	you didn't even tell me anything what she's doing so
B	well she only applied for it like the other week and then like a week later from when she applied for it it was in the Christmas holidays cos I went over and then she applied whilst I was there and then a few days later she said
A	wow well done
B	erm
A	oh yeah
B	but then I applied a few days later but I think I was a bit too like it's a different department so they could've been doing it different ways
A	yeah yeah
B	they they aim to get it done in
A	how?
A	yeah yeah
B	oh no
A	I wonder if I can get away with not telling telling anyone else
A	yeah I'll just be like dunno
B	yeah?
A	yeah
A	I've said yeah I've said dunno to people too many times
B	good way to go about it
A	so
B	good way to go about it
A	so so I don't think people ask me any more
B	mm
A	well I wish they didn't anyway
A	I'm gonna lie to your face then
B	like but I'd be like no no you definitely did say what was it?
A	well there's no other time
B	escaping
