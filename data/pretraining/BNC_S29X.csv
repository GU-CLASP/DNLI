A	is that music a problem?
B	no I don't think so
A	alright then
B	hi
A	yes this is a a recreational course at the Creative Innovation Centre so the creative the word creative innovation is key to the sort of course we do here it's not the normal erm sort of for instance watercolour for beginners type course so a lot of the erm the people who attend are the majority of them are mature people and quite a few have experienced a reasonably good or very er professional art education but it's open to erm anyone really and we have about twenty doing painting and drawing in the morning and about twenty doing the life drawing and the nearest you could say was related to would be a foundation type course
B	right
A	in an art school so it's quite diagnostic in a sense
B	right okay
A	but it's very erm liberally individually biased er in the sense that people are encouraged to sort of work in a way that suits them and I suppose my philosophy would be that they'll learn more from each other than they would from me
B	right
A	cos cos they work they're encouraged to experiment really
B	right okay so what sort of qualification do they get afterwards is it in line with an art access course or anything?
A	no there is no qualification as such
B	no okay
A	so it's not it's not a ratified recognisable
B	right
A	erm educational qualification it it is purely recreational
B	right
A	but it's also seen as part of the sort of a wider remit here where we do all sorts of music and poetry and languages and performance
B	right
A	and even theatre occasionally
B	yeah
A	and we've got a new cinema
B	oh gosh yes
A	yes
B	I've just noticed that wow
A	well sorry not a new cinema
B	right
A	we've got a new
B	screen
A	huge screen
B	a huge screen?
A	yes
B	oh wow
A	yeah
B	so what sort of things are they showing then?
A	er some very popular films like erm oh Citizen Kane
B	right
A	we've been showing and Lawrence of Arabia we've done The Bicycle Thieves
B	yeah
A	Italian films
B	right
A	er all sorts really
B	right
A	so
B	right
A	quite a healthy mix but the the the the art on the Friday is seen as just an integral part of the whole centre really
B	right great erm and
A	Alan Bennett's?
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh God
A	but I know a lot about the Lady
B	in the Van yeah
A	because yeah I've been following that for years
B	yes have you
A	yeah but I'm looking forward to it and I will be seeing it
B	yeah it's terribly poignant
A	yeah I can imagine
B	and I I I erm I found it incredibly sad
A	yeah
B	although I could see that there was a bit of humour in it but it was incredibly poignant and it left me feel you know with a a feeling of erm she'd been on the run all her life basically and that's what that's what the feeling it left me with erm so erm they do a lot of films down at the Odeon
A	not as such yet I'm not er but it's it's
B	yes you can
unknown_female	yeah
A	is it it's linked with what?
unknown_female	the British Film Institute
A	the British Film Institute
B	oh right oh
A	so
B	you're on a sort of rotation thing?
A	yeah but I'm so I can see the films becoming
B	quite popular
A	well it could you could run two or three
B	yes you could
A	I would think the nearest equivalent I can think of is
B	right
A	now
B	yeah what's the name of that French comedian was it Petit?
A	Jacques Tati
B	Tati Tati I'd love to see some Jacques Tati films
A	oh oh well I have got
B	I really would
A	well this is not the answer you want but I can bring I can bring you some of mine and you can take them home
B	oh oh wow I'd love that
A	yeah
B	I just love him
A	yeah well
B	because when we were at erm college I took one out of the library once
A	ah
B	and
A	yeah
B	it just sort of appealed to us
A	yeah I've got sort of got a few I can
B	have you? oh
A	we'll sort that out
B	okay
A	I'll drop them I'll bring them up or

A	I mean most women would be
B	yeah well I
A	you know they'd like to to lose but
B	I I wasn't
A	you don't really need to lose weight
B	well I was nine stone four and I've gone down to
A	oh dear
B	eight and a half so but that's
A	yeah
B	only because I'm not eating what I used to eat which was I used to like a piece of cake you know
A	yeah
B	and like you know like some sweet things but I haven't had anything sweet
A	well
B	that's all it is it's not it's not sinister it's just the fact that I'm have had to give up yeast and if you have to give up yeast you have to give up sugar cos of the
A	yes
B	fermentation thing
A	yeah
B	so there you go so that that's erm that's the situation so you're keeping fit though aren't you? you look very fit
A	well as you can see I'm seventy-one so I can't complain
B	crikey seventy-one
A	but I I
B	yeah
A	and I and I walk and do things I cannot live a sedentary life so I'm really
B	no
A	almost Greek isn't it really?
B	yes yeah
A	mind and body keep them
B	exactly keep them going and what about erm er are you still going abroad to in the summer? I think you used to go abroad in the summer was it Africa you used to go?

A	no I
B	oh right
A	for painters under twenty-five art students
B	right
A	and it takes place at the
B	right
A	which is a big student hostel
B	right
A	erm the
B	right
A	and we've been taking students there for years I've I took I've taken them there from various art schools
B	right yeah
A	and it's a wonderful competition where they come from well
B	yeah
A	various other places
B	oh right
A	and you go around and you put your
B	really?
A	oh champagne and and oysters and salmon and and then the one who gets the most votes wins
B	yeah oh right
A	and gets twenty thousand pounds
B	goodness
A	and an exhibition
B	oh right
A	for the well if we'd have still been erm around
B	yes
A	we'd have done it
B	yes yeah
A	in fact
B	right
A	the year after I left
B	oh did they?
A	with four
B	right
A	the problem with
B	yes that's right no it wouldn't have worked
A	well some
B	some would have worked
A	you can always find a few under twenty-five
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but not that many
B	not that many have you been to the new building down there? they said they opened it recently
A	I haven't but it's absolutely I've heard things like it's so sanitised and clinical it almost
B	oh is it?
A	looks like a they're gonna
A	or it's a cross between that and some sort of government
B	right
A	social security building but it was empty
B	oh right nothing in it at all?
A	well I don't know I don't know what's happened there
B	right
A	I know loads of the courses have gone
B	yeah
A	been closed off
B	oh right yeah
A	and as you know fine art was closed
B	yes it was yeah
A	the principal closed that
B	yeah well I'm not surprised she erm
A	she said she didn't like the staff
B	no the
A	she didn't like the staff and she didn't like the students
B	no no
A	quite odd that isn't it?
B	it is
A	that one person can decide
B	exactly
A	to deprive all these people
B	yes
A	in this
B	well you remember when I took her to task about it all?
A	oh you yes
B	I went I I went a bit berserk and I got
A	that's right yeah
B	and she said
A	was he a Liberal?
B	a Liberal Democrat
A	no well they got
B	yeah
A	got voted out
B	yeah
B	can you turn it down?
A	can we?
B	we're recording
A	I'm recording sorry it won't take much longer
B	another five minutes erm we're nearly finished erm so
A	it was a Tory stronghold for years and years and years
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	the sort of
B	well absolutely yeah
A	I think he was chairman of the Nineteen Twenty-Two Committee
B	yeah have you ever heard him speak?
A	yes
B	he's brilliant
A	when I was younger
B	absolutely brilliant
A	that would be when I was younger I think he's probably
B	he came to
A	dead
B	well he talked about they were closing the maternity home in
A	ah
B	and we I went with some friends of mine who had lots of children and had used the maternity home and I went with them to hear him speak and he was absolutely brilliant
A	yeah
B	he really was so erm yeah
A	well he he was quite yeah I think he was quite a sort of one-nation Tory
B	he was
A	mm yeah a decent chap
B	he really knew how to to give a good speech but then at his age then even then he would have had a lot of experience and to be
A	oh yes
B	a good speaker you need to have a lot of experience
A	yeah yes
B	erm you know?
A	yeah I can imagine
B	yeah he's a very good speaker
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and confident with it
B	well yeah absolutely yeah I mean he well when you've been doing the same sort like yourself when you've been doing the same subject for years and years
A	mm mm
B	you know erm and you're sort of top of your tree in your whatever it is he's erm we've got about another five minutes to go so I don't know whether you want to say anything?
A	only about
B	yeah
A	I could speak quite relaxed and and no problem at a hundred students
B	yeah
A	a hundred and fifty and I've done that often
B	yeah
A	I always hated formal speaking though
B	did you?
A	sort of like the BA presentation type speech
B	yes yes I know yeah
A	and I really really hated it
B	yeah
A	to the point that I could almost be physically sick beforehand
B	really?
A	I never liked that er because it was too formal for me but just generally
B	yeah yeah
A	I have no problem at all
B	no no no I've never had any problem talking in public either I've what was my first training was on the stage so I I did three years at drama school
A	mm
B	and I mean performing is better to me than actually
A	yeah yeah
B	doing anything else erm you know? much better than anything else really so erm so what do you see the future of this course are you going to be doing anything more or are you gonna keep this going in the same way?
A	well the way it's going here
B	yeah
A	this although it's an extraordinarily good building it's not big enough
B	yeah
A	and I I suppose as the the Brew House dropped away a bit
B	yeah
A	and I know it's still going
B	yeah
A	but this is sort of almost they've crossed over
B	yeah
A	and this is on the up I mean I know they've applied and have got a a an access course
B	yeah yeah
A	running and er for next year so there is other possibilities where they could do sort of er FDAs and all sorts here
B	yes
A	but but that would erm need some more accommodation which they've
B	right
A	possibly acquired this huge place opposite
B	oh right
A	yeah but that wouldn't be anything to do with me I've really I don't know I'm very much an integral part I just really got the thing off the ground
B	no yeah
A	in terms of the visual arts that side of it
B	yeah I think we might stop cos the music's got so loud hasn't it? erm so
A	was that okay?
B	yeah yeah yeah that's erm I'll just check there er stop recording is that
