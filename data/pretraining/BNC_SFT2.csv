A	you get to play around with gadgets all day
A	oh
B	oh
A	all I got to play around to er with today was a pen and paper
B	that's no fun
A	and a computer
B	I was gonna say it's really a computer
A	really?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	I like a spreadsheet
A	I've been er being distracted by er well no it's not been that bad
B	oh
A	popping onto the BBC News website a few times this morning
B	yes
A	partly
B	or just generally?
A	yeah
B	huh
A	I haven't been paying much attention
B	I haven't seen anything about that
B	hm
A	it's unsurprising I suppose
B	what? What happens you mean?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	hm
B	yeah?
A	gradually
B	mhm
A	mm
B	can't remember what it was gonna go up to
A	it's eventually going to be at ten thousand
B	yeah
A	but hopefully once it's reached that it
B	but yes
A	it's gonna
A	otherwise you know
B	otherwise it's a bit pointless
A	yeah
B	ah
B	does mean that like the fridge stinks
A	yeah
B	and it does mean like at half past eleven at night I'm standing there like
A	what? Have you? So you just? What?
B	can of tuna
A	oh right
A	mm
B	in a tiny bowl
A	half past eleven I was mm mooching around in my mess of a room in the dark watching the second half of Cats
B	mhm
A	I dunno
A	mm
B	oh right
B	nice
A	no
A	mm
B	cats is good though
A	it is
A	definitely a better choice than Phantom
B	yeah
A	er Phantom?
B	mm
A	er
B	er er I love the story
A	I saw it in the cinema
B	mm
A	that was the first time I'd seen it
B	mm
A	or even heard the story or whatever
B	oh okay
A	mm
B	Cos I'd heard
B	all the songs but I'd never seen any version of it
A	I did um see er recordings of some of the stage versions
B	mm
B	right
A	I mean they're
B	mm
B	yeah
B	are all all the actors are redubbed for the songs aren't they
A	hm?
B	are the all the actors redubbed for the songs? I can't remember
A	I I
B	as in
A	I think they must be
B	Cos I don't know if it's them singing
A	it is
B	it is? Okay
A	it is them
B	okay
A	but it's
B	who it isn't her
A	it's just a studio then
B	oh I see
A	except
A	oh what? The the the the arrogant one
B	mm
A	oh that isn't her?
B	I don't think so
A	oh right
B	Cos I remember reading about it and thinking that's disgraceful
A	and of course she has to be good enough at singing to sing badly
B	mhm
A	or
B	yeah
A	intentionally badly
B	yeah
A	hm
B	but
A	but yeah
B	yes
A	mm
B	bit different
A	mm
B	but um it's the original
A	no
B	oh okay
A	okay
B	the most pathetic individual
A	mm
B	but he's really good
A	mm
B	mm
A	what's her name?
B	the woman
A	yep
B	yeah
A	er
B	I think it was her
A	on stage
B	Christine
A	but er yeah
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	partly because she was less vibrato
A	and er obviously
B	yeah
B	mm
A	but you know
B	but
A	yes
A	Cos otherwise I'd be moping
A	yeah
B	cats is kind of sad but in a
A	you know they um like
B	weird way so
A	they recorded a a brand new um song for the
B	for Cats?
A	mm
B	oh right
A	no not  not Cats no not  Cats
B	oh Phantom
A	phantom
B	uh-huh
A	and indeed yes made up lyrics
B	hm
A	but less so
B	mm
A	um
B	hm
A	learn to be Lonely
B	oh dear
A	I know
B	oh my God
A	exactly
B	you've just watched all of that and then you've got that song
A	yeah
B	depressing
A	it's er it's a good song
A	it's nice
B	yeah
A	it's not chirpy and cheerful
A	it's at least kind
B	mm
A	it's um
B	mm
A	er her
B	mm
A	um
B	oh
A	anyway
B	sad
A	hm
B	mm
A	I think I might have I'm
B	mm
A	ah
A	oh no
B	controversial
A	it's it's split now
B	mm?
B	who's in the running?
A	er Jemima
B	mm
A	and
B	who's
A	the Rumpleteazer
B	she's pretty cool
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm?
B	A bit more prominent as well
A	oh yeah
A	I'm not basing it purely on that
B	she's er she's a cool cat
A	mm
B	I sort of feel duty-bound
B	to say Rum Tum Tugger
B	but
B	but actually I think my favourite is um the magician cat um
A	mistoffelees
B	mistoffelees
A	mm
B	that is really cool
A	it's terrible in the film
B	um
A	I er I remember thinking um
B	mm
A	it it was kind of
B	mm
A	but in on the film er the all of the lights on it
B	mm
A	kind of flash on and off in in specific sequence
A	it's kinda
B	such a little thing but
A	I er
B	yeah
A	at the same time it's yeah
B	mm
A	tacky
B	yeah
A	oh
B	that's probably a pretty good sound test
