B	erm
A	mm?
B	they were
A	well
C	piglets?
B	there are
A	mm
B	were squeezing through little gaps in the er walls that separated the different pigs
C	and then they all got into one and they started sniffing around for food
B	but only one pig stayed behind
C	and that one was a sheep
A	ah
C	yeah very they were like
A	even noisier than you
B	oh mum remember when we saw the little piglets asleep in their little
B	they were so cute they were going
A	they were very sweet weren't they? and they had yes it was like a little incubator it was keeping them nice and snuggly-buggly nice and warm
C	and they were also preserving body heat by snuggling up with each other
A	they were
B	will you buy one for me?
C	a piglet?
A	a piglet?
B	an incubator
A	well it was like you were being an
A	you were sleeping like the piglets next to each other but you were sleeping underneath the quilt that
A	and I tried to move it a couple of times but you just put it kept putting it back
A	you were so sweaty and hot
A	but you're you were lying much lower down than
A	I couldn't find you for ages
A	do you actually sleep quite well when you're together?
B	yeah
A	do you?
C	yeah
A	it doesn't look like there's a lot of room I keep meaning to say let's put the other bed out but that takes such a lot of faff
A	are you gonna sleep together tomorrow when
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yep
B	because the reason why we sleep together is because erm
A	mm?
B	and we feel safe with somebody and
B	we basically seem to always talk for a bit
A	you chat forever I was like what what do you talk about? that's what I want to know
B	erm
C	huskies
A	mm?
C	yeah
A	that's pretty cool I mean we were very late last night though
C	late late
A	cos the hoop class went on quite late
C	no we only chat for about chatted for about two hours very very small
A	and what was this problem with this boy at the park at
B	erm
C	he tried to and er failed to arrest
A	but did he just come over and start playing with you guys?
B	no
C	no
A	what happened then?
B	so he had he had got some people to get loads and loads of logs
A	and put them
B	in a corner where they keep the toy tractors
C	yeah and I was trying to move them because it was a potential hazard because some
A	uhu?
C	and I was just moving them
A	mm
B	and then they became really angry and started chasing
C	yeah well they failed in catching me
B	and he had plastic handcuffs
A	mm?
C	and a plastic badge and kept saying stuff in the name of the law I just found it a really fun game
A	but then what were they doing when we went to the woods later?
B	erm well one boy tripped
A	yeah but why?
B	they he put because erm I'll tell you what happened
A	mm?
B	and
A	which obviously you're allowed to do

C	I didn't
B	well
A	what? to the boys?
B	well we just were talking about it but
A	yes?
B	and then erm one of them said it was dinosaur tooth and
A	yeah
B	and then I said but you're not allowed to hurt girls and then said yeah and I said but you hurt a girl
A	right?
B	and they were like well the boy who pushed
A	mm

B	and I was very caring to
A	mm?
B	cos I asked her what was wrong and she had a little cut and I said come on
A	yes you don't need to push somebody over do you?
B	and
A	for that reason?
B	and I was like it's so silly
C	I did tell them it's a log I said that's not a dinosaur tooth that's a stick
A	no I know
C	and he said yeah but it looks like a dinosaur tooth
A	well went to the woodlands to avoid them didn't we so?
C	a few
A	it was a bit unfortunate that they joined
B	but luckily
A	mm?
B	the boys' mums
A	yeah
B	the boys' mums were very very nice
A	well they were alright they listened to the issues
C	I know I was just
A	he was probably your age
C	really? nine
A	yeah if that
C	well I really I am really really worried about the future of boys
C	yeah how immature they're gonna be
B	mm
A	well he's obviously got a big imagination hasn't he?
C	the percentage of the class
A	erm so it's you
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	anybody else?
C	no not really
A	well
B	yeah
C	I know who you're thinking about
A	I'm thinking about
B	mum he's not lovely
A	he is lovely
B	he
C	he pooped
B	so erm
A	thank you
B	I had an idea er cos we did it cos we did it wrong that
A	he snatched your hand away from what?

A	I think you've told me this before
B	yeah
A	take your hand away from your mouth cos I can't hear
B	and then
A	mm?
B	and we did it wrong and she said we couldn't change it but then they changed it
A	but
B	yeah
A	anybody else?
B	erm well
A	but they're sensible mostly aren't they?
B	erm
A	you've got some nice boys in your class
B	yeah but sometimes
B	sensible boys can but there are boys which are not very sensible like
A	I know but that's not many what did you say
C	I'm still worried
A	you're still worried about the future of boys?
C	yeah cos that his two years' difference
A	mm?
C	two years can last a long time
A	mm
C	two thousand and fourteen didn't last long though oh wait was that? or was it two thousand and fifteen? oh yeah two thousand and fourteen lasted ages
A	did it?
C	yeah
A	why?
C	I think it might have but there was a definitely a year
A	about the?
C	that went by so fast
A	you mean year two? went slowly but year three went fast?
C	I think so
A	mm?
C	it might've been there
A	well it's two thousand and sixteen now
C	year two
A	so do you think year three went fast but year two went slowly
C	erm I think it could've been year two going fast
