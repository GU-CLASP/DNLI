A	mm
B	well she just wanted us to remember
A	but why?
B	I don't know
A	when I was little we also learnt Pluto but they've got rid of that now
B	Pluto?
C	I was alive when it was
B	it was when you were born Pluto?
A	it was the thought of as a planet
C	for a while
A	when I was little
C	because I when when I was about maybe three years old I had a big erm solar system thing
A	oh you did you did have a big chart about it yeah
C	yes and there was Pluto on it
A	mm
C	although now we've discovered planet nine
A	mm
C	either that or
A	oh I don't know
C	in our solar system a ninth planet or tenth planet including Pluto which I think
A	that seems a bit mean doesn't it to?
C	yeah just take taking a planet
A	I don't know how they decided
C	out of the solar system
A	you know that it was too small and it couldn't be a planet but anyway
B	do you know what erm a pin-sized thingy of a blue planet of a blue planet erm was the same
A	a pin-sized thingy
C	had yeah I've told you this the Empire State thing
B	yeah
C	of the pin-
A	of a?
C	oh
B	what is it?
C	you know the matter of stars
B	matter of erm matter of a star weighs erm the same as three Empire States
A	three Empire State buildings
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah a huge planet
C	which is a star but it's
A	it's what?
C	it's much bigger than the sun and much more powerful it's blue which means it's extremely hot
A	so that's probably what will happen to our sun one day then?
C	what? it will turn blue?
A	sorry if a what?
C	turn blue
A	well I guess so if it's burning up
C	the red ones are the coldest
A	it will get hotter and hotter the sun
B	mum shall I tell you something you might not know?
C	when it destroys the moon how hot will it get?
B	the blue ones are the hottest and the red ones are the coldest
A	mm planets or stars?
B	planets or stars
A	are you talking about planets or stars in terms of blue and red?
B	erm planets or stars depending
A	well a star is sort of burning it's slowly it's dying that's what a star is
B	once they die they create a black hole
A	and sometimes the stars that you can see in the sky are already dead but they were sort of still you know? the speed of light and all I can't remember exactly now but it means you can be looking at it
C	mm
A	mm?
C	in my it can't be true book
A	oh yes
C	is wrong cos it I'm not sure if it has Pluto as a planet
A	I don't think it does
