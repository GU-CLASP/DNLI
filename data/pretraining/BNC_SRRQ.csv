A	I should've finished

A	it was at a glimpse cos it was a bit dark but the two nights I dropped
B	oh yes yeah
B	oh okay
A	have they both lost weight?
B	they might've done
A	cos it looked to me like they might've done because obviously
B	oh do you know erm they were here on Saturday night and I wouldn't've noticed that's terrible
A	oh so maybe not then
B	but they were
A	right right
B	but he quite possibly had because cos he's trying he's really trying with his diabetes and in actual fact he'd had another test cos I asked him how it was and his blood pressure was fine
A	mm
B	that was all under control now they've changed the tablets and the diabetes he was he was down er what's the number they give you? I don't know the number er was it six?
B	and I think he was at six or something so erm although apparently once you've been diagnosed diabetic they won't take that away but he's
A	that's good
B	so it's good mm
A	yeah yeah
B	but he might've done I never said to them but they bought us those chocolates you can have a chocolate if you want
A	you do spoil me when I come here
B	I know
A	all the time
B	so did erm did
unknown_female	mm
B	well he didn't just in case cos he only had a
A	oh
B	cos he was gonna hire some waterproof wellies erm not wellies
A	oh
B	and he didn't have any
A	I think we've got some waterproof trousers at home
B	yeah well they were only like a pound weren't they to hire?
A	oh
B	they were a pound twenty or something to hire I said oh I'm not buying them
B	just in case you know he wanted to buy anything
B	I don't think there's anything to
A	no
B	I think he probably ended up with about twenty
A	oh yeah yeah
B	you know? and they'll easily get through money there
A	yeah and they were going to McDonald's this morning for breakfast
B	this morning all of that yeah so that's what it was really
A	mm

B	it was no trouble so anyway we're still eating the chocolate
A	erm when
B	mm?
A	that conversation that developed
B	yes yeah yeah
A	yeah he came around with a bunch of flowers for me
B	oh did he?
A	yeah and I said oh
B	ah for recommending him?
A	yeah he said thank you like you know? for recommending me for the paper round I said oh you're welcome I said oh
A	cos you don't know at that age do you?
B	no
A	and I said can I give you a hug? and he said yes so I gave him a big hug and I text
B	mm
A	and erm it was lovely that
unknown_female	mm
A	ah
B	oh how funny
A	it's like
B	mm mm mm
A	and then of an evening you can all chill out a little bit
B	yeah yeah
A	I said you're not working all day and all night I said so it'll be really nice and he said yeah so I said to him well can I give you a big hug?
A	cos you know if you just go to hug them
B	oh
A	yeah
A	it's it's it's like just coming down from school talking about them growing up and being independent
B	mm
A	just a snippet of er you know? Jeremy Vine or whatever erm a lady saying how children are forever growing and becoming independent and you have to seize the opportunity for example the the example she gave was one of her children er
B	mm
A	made enquiries or showed interest one day when she was chopping carrots
B	oh?
A	so she went through it with them here you are you chop she was there to help them if they wanted any help or questions but she said you have to seize the opportunity when they show willing so going back to the hug
B	mm
A	if I find sometimes if I go to hug
B	ah
A	do you know what I mean? cos he's not in mood I think oh he doesn't wanna hug me
B	yeah mum get off me
A	so I'm like oh can I have a hug? and he went yeah
B	because the bus wasn't leaving until ten thirty this morning was it?
A	no and yet they didn't seem to have be any er you know? no no we don't have to go to school mum because you know? they've said we'll have to er work when we get there so
B	and yet they didn't yeah
A	I can't it's all a bit blas√©
B	well they're being dropped to erm
A	and then walking down into
B	mm I know cos
A	so he's walked to and from McDonald's? he's going to get wet
B	yes
B	yes how ridiculous and he was adamant he was not unpacking his coat
A	oh bless him
A	oh I said to
B	mm oh that's organised
A	cos one of his casual jogger trousers type thing
B	mm
A	he he's wore
B	oh when she moved in? oh well did he have paint on them?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so so he they're fine for around the house like
B	oh yeah but also for the fieldwork they're doing
A	well for the fieldwork yeah erm
B	oh I don't even know what
A	oh did he?
B	orienteering apparently at A level it's harder to get a practical mark in a second subject a second like like like
A	right
B	but I mean he has actually got a few to choose from he could do hockey or er but er he could do tennis umpiring or all sorts but apparently the teachers have said that that they fall down a bit on the grades for the second practical so they had organised an orienteering in the park
A	right
B	so it was everybody had to go that was doing the A level PE so Friday and Saturday he spent the days in
B	the first and second one
B	well he shouldn't should he? really
A	no
B	so but I mean he was taking it very light-heartedly because he didn't need the erm the the grade if you like he just er so of course
B	then go left
A	oh no
B	is there any point? but anyway my point was so he didn't get back till like five o clock on Saturday
A	Saturday
B	and then of course cos of he'd had all his outdoor clothes and walking boots for those two days orienteering he said will you wash all of this mum? for me to take
B	which he didn't actually give to me till
A	stuff
B	stuff that he'd worn the last two days that he wanted to then take
B	typical
A	I to be honest I haven't I haven't interfered with
B	I did buy him his Marigolds though cos that made me laugh
A	oh yes
A	well
B	oh right I didn't I just bought yellow I didn't ask actually whether he wanted pink
A	well I
B	oh
A	I couldn't find any blue
B	no I haven't seen blue for a while actually
A	no I haven't no and I know you can because I've got a pair in my under my kitchen sink
A	so we ended up picking them up from whilst we were at Asda and then it was like oh do you want them fleece-lined?
A	do you want heavy duty?
B	who knew there was such
A	do you want plain pink? or yellow pink with a lining? so he he's ended up taking
B	oh
A	I think it was a pack
B	yeah they do
A	so I said you'd be better with the lined ones I said so take them
B	mm
A	and and if you're
B	oh has he got the
A	no no no erm just er a pack of the yellow ones
B	oh okay okay
A	but I think there's two or three pairs in there
A	so depending on what they're doing
B	he won't even wear them knowing him I can't imagine he will
A	and when did
B	er I don't know when was he er when do they
B	and do they last ten years?
A	well that's what I thought
B	do they not
A	well I thought they did because when er when I got that date I I needed for something I can't remember what it was to put when he'd had his last tetanus so I phoned the doctors up and said oh I'm completing this form for school they need it out
B	mm
A	are you able to help me? she said oh yes that's no problem at all tap tap tap tap told me the date and I said okay I said and do you do a recall when he's due?
B	mm
A	do you recall them in? she said yes we do so I'm thinking with the nature of what they're doing I'm assuming they're gonna be in soil and ponds and
B	I've no idea didn't never even occurred to me but the doctors hadn't recalled him in for a a booster?
A	no they haven't
B	oh so he must still
A	so I'm going I'm gonna I'm going to need to phone and just say
B	on the form the medical form we had to fill out before they went it didn't ask did it?
A	yeah on the one he brought home the weekend
B	oh did it?
A	he brought one home the weekend about erm bedwetting asthma er that sort of thing that they had to take back today
A	they did the one before
B	I don't think he gave me a form did he give me a form?
A	it was just one A4 sheet
B	he did give me no he gave me the clipped thing that had the all the information on the thing and that was that and then he and he did say to me oh there's another form
A	yes that was about a week or so ago
B	but you don't need to send that back cos we've we've done that or something
A	yeah
B	and that was it
A	but no yeah exactly the same but
B	oh
B	cos it it hasn't come to me I haven't seen it
A	well I thought
B	and did that one say when did they last have their tetanus?
A	yes that was the one asking the question
B	oh well that's
A	cos I thought to myself oh my goodness me I hope due to the nature of what they're doing they don't say oh he can't go on it because he's
B	oh no cos they'd've sent it way in advance wouldn't they?
A	well that's what I was thinking
B	they should've
A	that's a bit remiss of them isn't it? if
B	I haven't had a call
A	yeah
B	I
A	and he's not been dropped off?
B	and he's not come home
A	so I assume he's gone I don't know
A	oh
B	did
A	no
B	no
A	no unless he's took his Ipad
A	dunno
B	oh
A	oh no cos he sold it to
B	oh okay well anyway they've gone to be honest with you he was so annoying on Sunday I think we were all quite pleased to see the back of him for four days
A	glad to see the back of him
B	cos
A	oh is it just the two of you?
B	so it's just me and
A	oh how lovely
B	so I said oh
B	he might be inviting his new girlfriend over tomorrow
B	he he's only had two so this is his second one
A	so this is after
B	so this is
B	when he's gone but
A	oh isn't it funny how?
A	just in what way? just like attitude? or?
B	just yeah attitude and answering back and winding his brother up about everything and anything you know? oh drove me mad
B	got to last night I said shouldn't you go and stand outside now and wait for
A	oh bless him
B	bless him
B	but er oh
A	oh
B	does he?
A	yeah he spends loads of time up in his bedroom he's either doing his homework bless him
B	mm
A	or he might be playing on catch up or something or he's on on Playstation with his friends but it's not excessive Playstation so I don't mean we never see him and you know? it's it's
B	no no no well
A	yeah yeah
B	he came
B	he said
B	you can't be failing them all he said I I
A	so he's recognised that
B	I
A	gosh is this my boy?
B	no no he said he said to me I did think to myself oh I could just you know not say anything and just enjoy playing tennis for the next two years but I did think maybe that'd be a waste of two years I said well well done you he said and I do think I ought to try and get my A levels I said so do I I said and we're not classing an E as a as a good grade no he said we're not
B	I said right okay
A	no you've got to have some
B	it's just that he when he goes out for
A	no
B	he'd be so we've er
A	mm
B	he said the only one that I'm doing work for is PE he said and do you know why I'm doing that? I said no he said because they're like they did in the GCSE if you don't hit your target grades at every single thing you're doing they send a letter home and make you stay to a booster session on a Friday night which is what they used to do for GCSE he said and I didn't want a letter home and I didn't want to have to stay so I said and and you're hitting your target? yes he said I said so clearly you can do it you just need to put the time in
A	he's capable mm
B	so he's like you know
A	mm but
B	I said well that's alright I
A	absolutely yeah
B	you want to do it you don't wanna waste two years he said yeah and also there is parents' evening coming up so you probably would've found out
B	I said probably might've
A	yeah we've got that haven't we next week?
B	is it next week?
A	the tenth night after
B	oh yeah who's
A	twenty-two
B	twenty-two?

unknown_female	oh
A	right me
B	yeah
B	oh okay
B	yeah
A	cos
B	really?
A	they're going out I said well bring him
A	cos when we went
B	it's only girls isn't it?
A	yeah but
A	erm when we took them to the show and we went over for the Chinese
B	mm
A	and walked back and
B	it's more relaxing yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I can't believe it
A	so I said well if
B	oh that's nice
A	then there's you
B	possibly
A	possibly
B	mm
A	erm I haven't included
B	oh sorry
A	she is? right so so us three
B	she would yeah
A	you
B	er er
A	more or less
B	yes
B	oh the one that was meant to be there the other week? yeah
A	then there's erm
B	yeah
A	plus one cos he
B	is
B	mm and her mum?
A	her mum and her sister
B	oh okay gosh
A	so three yeah
B	but quite a few but
A	yeah
B	but tell you what concerns me
A	oh I know
B	we could be there till three in the morning with the way they do it
A	well at people are people are probably I don't know
B	I don't know I
A	I think she'll have more staff than just
B	do you?
A	yeah I reckon she might
B	oh okay
A	fetching and carrying and then there's another lady that helps her
B	I mean it'll be lovely so are we taking wine with us?
A	well I'm going to send a text out to everybody
B	mm
A	with the postcode and say it's arrive from seven
B	right
A	and I need to give brief directions when driving into
A	so I shall just put erm enter
B	yeah
A	down the tree-lined driveway across the cattle grid first left
B	mm
A	and then you'll see the big hall on your left-hand side up the driveway
A	yeah erm so yeah she's gonna provide all the glasses and she's gonna put some nibbles on so what she'll include in the text is tea and coffee tea and coffee available
B	or the other way round you meant that if you'd like a glass of wine offer non-drivers a soft drink
B	I knew what you meant
A	yes yes well spotted
B	yeah okay
A	erm
B	bring some so sort of bring your own okay
B	so who who are you taking? obviously
A	oh
B	right
A	she she does know where it is but she
B	mm
A	because then she
B	right right okay
B	oh okay
A	erm
B	mm
A	on a Wednesday night
B	I didn't know whether to mention it to
A	yeah I haven't mentioned it to her
B	no perhaps I won't then I'll just ask if she
B	oh I mean we won't be there for seven anyway erm
A	yeah
B	across the way
A	mm
B	so er she said that's fine they'll organise bringing
A	right
B	and then
A	but you'll still be there by half past yeah
B	and also I spent so much last time I was there
A	yeah
A	no no no I know same here
A	twenty percent discount
B	and I thought you are
A	no I can't do this coming Friday?
B	yes
A	no no no I can't do the fourth
B	oh okay
A	no that's why I haven't sent a text out or anything to anybody
B	right
A	but potentially well for two reasons if I'm honest
B	yes
A	and I'm thinking oh er he might be in the mood for telling us all about it and I don't wanna miss that opportunity
B	and also they've said an eleven o'clock return haven't they? but they have also said that that it could be earlier
A	it could be earlier
B	could be half nine couldn't it? and that's right in the middle of the evening
A	yeah and and if you're hosting and you're saying oh I'll be back in half an hour
A	I did I don't mind but other people might think oh you know?
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and two I was thinking well if it's before the
B	yes yeah that's true actually
A	and if
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	well cos I
A	so
B	and then I thought well if you're mad if you
A	I know
B	so there was something in there for er
A	oh bless her bless her
B	but I thought a pot of that might be nice and it was it was twenty pounds but well twenty percent off you know? you may as well get it for sixteen it makes sense doesn't it?
A	absolutely
B	so I did just ask that and then I'm thinking what am I going to order at
A	well I don't I don't know I was gonna run this by you today I don't know whether to have one on Thursday the seventeenth?
B	thing is will she have got? if anybody's waiting on Christmas presents will she have got the order in in time?
A	don't know cos I said this didn't I? I did stipulate
B	mm
A	look what if people come and nobody buys because of the time of year? and
B	yes yeah
A	you know you don't want it to be a wasted evening for her but
B	I know she wants to
A	she's not too bothered is she?
B	no she's not she's not or you could just leave it till the New Year because by the seventeenth I just don't think people'll be still looking for Christmas presents especially that we then can't take away there and then and have to wait for the order
A	but do we just have it as a girly night? not even people worrying about as a
B	oh we could do
A	just as a girly get-together
B	we could do
A	what do you think of the seventeenth though?
B	is that a Thursday did you say?
A	do you think people will come if
B	well it's the last day it's the last day for a lot of people isn't it?
B	yes it probably would be
B	do it
A	I'll check with
B	oh the Friday night?
A	so he won't need me to pick him up or anything on the Thursday night I and I would imagine it'll be Scouts I think that's the night of the
B	oh okay
A	erm
B	is
A	no she finished now
B	oh she's finished? so she won't be there so it'll just be
A	yeah
B	right
A	yeah so
B	yeah do that
B	still don't know what er I mean I did like I did like it and it did feel nice
A	mm
B	but I'm still very happy with what I currently use
A	mm
B	I might I might
A	I mean I'm having my nails done now on a regular basis and
B	I know it's quite
A	it's it's having to come in it's having to come out the shopping money
B	yes
A	do you know what I mean? I haven't got a surplus twenty pound
B	no well you need to get earning some extra
A	yes need to
B	no I know what you mean I know what you mean
