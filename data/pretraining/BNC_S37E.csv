A	and then underneath was the
B	mm
A	he how old is
A	they're as slow as the region they're in aren't they?
A	I was like he's like they're good they're they're nice but they're quite slow I was like
B	yep
A	yeah they're it was you know it's alright
B	anyway so when are these talks on in London?
A	they range I'll send you the link they range from the beginning of October until the first of November so there's loads there's like walk round Hyde Park with history there's different types of
B	oh yeah
A	erm taxidermy on a mouse and apparently you get to keep the mouse
A	erm a talk on capital punishment a talk on plague talk on erm how to not
B	uhu
A	er one on how to embalm
B	uhu
A	it's basically just loads of like things that happened through history cos it's you know obviously like Halloween so they're obviously
B	yeah
A	doing like history of London
B	mm
A	and it's really it's and some of them look really interesting so I think
B	mm
A	I'm gonna go on the seventeenth of October to see one on capital punishment
B	is that a Saturday?
A	mm yes
B	yeah I'll come on that one
A	okay it's the seventeenth I think it's one
B	well yeah I can cos they're flying to erm that's when your dad goes to
A	okay well we'll go to London for the day
B	mm
A	on the seventeenth of October
B	mm
A	so it's erm the first one is on capital punishment
B	yeah
A	erm and that's at one o'clock and then I think the second one is on the plague and that's at three o'clock
B	oh fabulous
A	and it's in the same building it's all
B	oh great
A	it's in like a really nice stone building but I can't remember what it's called
B	no they
A	no yeah people are gonna do it some er from work so there might be some people from my work going
B	uhu
C	that oh that's pub's
B	mm
C	oh
B	no the whole well the whole pub
C	the pub's gone has it?
B	yeah
A	oh god it has actually hasn't it? what are they doing with this?
C	oh
B	nothing
A	cos that really
C	well no I I I cycle round now and because you're going slower you realise how many empty buildings there are
A	yeah
B	that's
C	there's no shortage of housing there is a shortage of I mean turning them into housing that's the problem
A	yeah cos they've turned the
C	they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the the pub is one house and then they've put four three houses in the in the garden
C	but they're not building little ones are they?
A	no
C	you get the feeling that
B	well that's what those little ones are those little ones are already two bedroom jobs yeah
A	but that's the thing like affordable housing like in
B	cos the the the thing is you
A	I don't I don't know
B	so
A	oh
B	yeah sorry
B	mm
A	er they're more the the house itself is three hundred and fifty thousand I think their deposit is thirty thousand and the government
B	mm
A	chip in something like a fifth or something?
B	mm
A	but erm and she was saying she said it's a bit like The Sims which is a computer game where you build houses and control people
B	mm
A	like you once you've bought the house you then go online and you buy like extras to go in it? like you can buy wardrobes or closing like you know like the slow close toilet doors?
B	yeah
A	and mirrors and stuff like that but the thing is she's like I can go on there and spend she hasn't spent it but hypothetically she can go on there and spend thousands of extra pounds
B	uhu
A	with just a click of a button which I think is really dangerous especially
B	but how much
A	as you can't see
B	is their mortgage a month then?
A	don't know like especially as you can't see the actual quality of the stuff you're buying I think that's really bad
C	but people now people just have more stuff
A	yeah definitely
C	you have you have boxes whereas there was about the time when people have a garage now people have garages and they don't use them they've got too much stuff so
C	well yeah
A	it's true
C	so
A	oh really?
C	yeah cos it's er it's not a change of use it's a retail outlet
A	oh so is that what they're gonna do do you think? change of the
B	yeah
C	well I just made that up I mean
A	but why don't you buy it dad?
C	with what?
A	I dunno
A	oh
C	exactly oh
B	you'd have to strip it right back and have to
A	the only pubs I go into dad are nice country pubs
C	yeah
B	that one we go in at
C	oh
B	we went down in the morning and er the reek in the
C	of stale beer
B	it was ghastly
C	thank well it wasn't thankfully but you know the smoking
B	no but it was it was terrible
C	yeah
B	and you were sitting there eating your breakfast thinking
C	yeah you've only ever been in the
A	oh yeah
C	and I've never been you know I probably had it in my youth but it was going back to that the
A	but you've been in the pub with grandad sometimes to watch football haven't you?
C	when?
A	did you not go to the
C	no the
A	no
C	never been in the
A	I've never been
B	I've
A	in the
B	I've I've been in the
C	I have been in the
C	never been in
A	I don't think I er no I have been in the
C	oh we used to go to the
A	yeah
C	so it was fifteen years ago so I certainly haven't been able to claim that I've kept pubs in
A	dad your alcoholic ways
C	that's why they're
A	just haven't supported the the local community
C	no I'd do what everybody would do and brought the booze home
A	mm
C	people cannot
A	yeah yeah
C	the pubs are banned it cos it was then you would think that some people you know
A	and people like to smoke when they have a drink
C	when they have a drink but the problem is that when they don't smoke they drink
A	so they
C	it doesn't
A	drink at home?
C	it's no well they they they would go for an extra pint because the
A	yeah
C	they're not drinking
B	and the problem the problem with the
C	hasn't it?
B	no horrible little courtyardy type of thing
C	oh right
B	but it's you know
C	well the
A	it has yeah
C	it's got a horrible
B	it's behind that
C	well it's got a
B	yeah
C	courtyard in it
B	no but the
C	oh right
B	out the back if you you know and it's where the toilet yeah it's really manky in the back of the
A	when did you ever go to the back of the
B	when the I I went in with
B	it was ghastly but the only place to smoke in the
A	yeah
B	and nobody well yeah
A	so wait there's there's the
B	so to get into to get in the
C	well you do in lots of pubs lately
A	did you say you have to walk through a thug?
B	a
C	a
A	oh
B	no a
A	what's a
B	a
A	oh I see I was a bit like oh mum you can't turn round and say that
B	no no
A	not all people in pubs
B	I mean
A	are thugs
B	I mean we walked we drove past the
A	it was packed wasn't it?
B	absolutely
A	more packed
B	mad oh yeah you were weren't you?
A	I went to
C	and people have to drive there don't they?
A	yeah or walk from
C	and it's a walk for them and that's what they do they walk over the bridge to there cos they can sit outside
A	that's why I was
C	even take the
A	mm
C	people are taking the
A	yeah what's the one it's on the way if you go the back way to
B	mm
A	is it
A	the pub by the
A	canal there?
C	the well it isn't a canal it's a river
A	oh a river
C	there's one there's one down
A	that's really nice but again you have to
A	drive to it
C	yeah well you yeah
A	same as like the
C	well actually you don't have to drive up you can swim
A	or cycle
C	or yeah you could in actual actually swim down there
A	is it actually illegal to cycle drunk?
C	I I think there are so many laws in the country now you could be probably illegal to do absolutely anything I mean when was the last time anybody got prosecuted for a
A	I saw an article in the news about erm a way to reduce the amount of cigarettes people throw on the floor they have a cigarette bin and erm it's got a question I think it was who do you think is the better footballer? and they had Ronaldo and Messi and then you put the fag in the option you thought
C	oh right
A	was the better footballer to motivate people to not drop their fags on the floor
C	you look at Paris they just flick their fags straight in the
A	oh to be fair
B	but no you have if someone come around at five o'clock in the morning and sweeps
A	yeah
B	them all up
A	I was gonna say normally
C	no they don't sweep it up they wash it
B	alright they wash it down
A	normally Paris is grim but when
A	we went the other weekend actually I thought it was really clean
B	it was really clean yeah
A	and I dunno what they
B	no they've just employed
A	clean up something
B	they've just employed a lot more people in the middle of the night
A	yeah
B	I was surprised when I heard something outside I looked out of the window and there was everybody
A	yeah
B	yeah they were just
C	fag ends down
B	cleaning them all
C	down the sewers
B	cleaning the streets
C	and
A	but they do that in Barcelona as well the the the dustbin men and the cleaners were coming round all the time
C	yeah
A	there was no
C	no
B	no
C	in Stockholm well they didn't need the
A	was it just immaculate in Stockholm?
B	it was yeah
C	it was really
A	well I'll have to add Stockholm to my list of places to go
C	no I don't think you have to go that far though
A	oh okay
B	Copenhagen's nice that was
A	I still think Budapest is on I still want to go to Budapest
B	yeah mind you at the moment you wouldn't
A	why? what's wrong with Budapest at the moment?
B	it's
C	it's where of these
A	oh yeah fair enough yeah yeah
C	there was a
A	a war?
C	one and a half one and a half million demanding independence from Catalonia
A	what so they don't want to be part of Catalonia but what do they want to be part of?
C	part
B	which is why I don't understand why we are taking kids to Barcelona who are doing Spanish
A	no but I always thought that Barcelona was part of Spain
B	it is
C	it is but they don't want to be part of it
B	they want they want to be they want
C	like the Basques
B	yeah
A	oh they want to be part of Catalonia?
C	well they they the they haven't got a they haven't got a
B	no
C	it's all political
B	they've got but they speak their own language there and all sorts
A	yeah the but some of them speak Spanish but yeah I know what you mean
B	yeah so why we're taking
A	but I don't understand why they're doing it like why do these stupid little niche people think that becoming independent is gonna do anything?
C	because the governments or the
A	yeah
C	at the moment it's easier to blame
A	yeah
C	Sturgeon and the Scots keep doing it's a bit harder when it comes home to roost and you've gotta make the decision
A	I just think being a politician must be so hard because you would
C	well that's
A	and it's just and but people don't seem to understand that it really annoys me that people just want what they want and don't really look at the big picture
C	yeah they're very short termism and if they've
A	yeah
C	they have to get elected that's why company owners often take longer term views and have come up with better solutions cos they've got wider options they can go to different countries
A	yeah
C	they can so if they're not making enough money in America they can say well why don't we build a factory in China and build and bring it in? the they've got more flexibility than what a politician has
A	cos that's been the problem with Obama hasn't it? it's just he hasn't been in power long enough to make the constitutional changes
C	I don't think Obama came from a class that he had enough leverage
A	no
C	and
C	well yeah nepotism bribery
A	yeah
C	corruption er only doing things for your state I mean the people that held up the the health er plans simply because they were trying to screw some more out of Obama for their state who frankly just they should have been shot
A	yeah it's not for the wider picture is it? it's for
C	no and
A	it's for them
C	and yet the mayor of Lille is held up as being great because he insisted that if you're gonna go through his region he wanted a station
A	yeah but that makes a point though
C	and it's revolutionised Lille
A	yeah but that's a good idea though isn't it?
C	well I dunno I I suppose to other people it it cost twenty million to put a station Lille that slowed their trip down by I dunno twenty minutes I've no idea but I'm just saying that he took a very localised view and it's revolutionised his city so all you can do is he's not elected to run France he's just elected to
A	represent his region
C	run Lille yeah
A	yeah
C	and you could say the same about democratic even America because you are
B	the last time I came back by Eurostar we came back via Lille
C	don't we always come back via Lille?
B	no no
C	oh right
B	no
C	cos Lille is north of the erm
B	yeah
A	but I don't see any problem with having a slightly longer journey to stop in places that actually people want to go to
B	well the Lille is now is gonna to be big now because it's the it's the way you go when you wanna go to erm
C	Brussels or those places
A	yeah so
B	Brussels but also when you want to go to erm the south
C	it gives people the yes
B	Avignon
A	so I don't really see
B	you don't have to go to Paris
A	such a problem with it it would be random if he ran if he put a
C	no I agree but he he took a very
A	and it paid off yeah I know what you mean
C	yeah er whereas you get the other ones who think that you know the the politicians who stand up and say oh we've we've only got a bypass because I did this and I did that and whatever you know well
A	are they
B	I got an we got an email from Eurostar yesterday did you read it?
A	erm talking about emails why does a Viking longboat company have my email address with your name?
C	it's not a Viking
A	what was it?
C	it's just a cruising company called Viking
A	well why why do I have it?
B	I don't but it's because you're on a you're on a thing of they've got a demographic that old people live at
A	no but you must have signed up to something
B	no I haven't signed up to anything they've sold my name on to
A	oh well
B	I got a phone call for you this week from Alex in India
A	for me?
B	yeah saying could we speak to Miss
B	and he said oh but her address
C	they're still ringing up about your your life insurance that we had with Aviva which was years ago
A	I keep having the
C	oh
A	okay it's like well obviously you're not
C	no computer systems aren't very good are they?
A	well no it's computer systems work fine it's the
C	yeah
B	or people who can't be arsed to clean the databases
A	yeah human computers that would only do what we tell them to do so you can't blame the computer system
A	yeah yeah true
C	or what or what have you so I don't know but
A	so how many bottles of wine do you actually own now father?
C	er seventy
A	seventy bottles of wine?
B	yeah but no but about forty-five left

B	mm
C	the the the individual
A	she'll love you it'll make she'll moan she'll be like you didn't send anything for my birthday and you'll be like ah ha ha in your face bitch
C	in your face bitch is not one of the most endearing phrases
A	no but don't say that's not what you're thinking
A	in your face bitch
A	well she didn't wish me happy birthday
C	well no
B	you like
C	have you bought your ticket?
A	yes oh no I haven't but it's er it's fine it's at twenty past seven
C	oh do you want to go this side or the other side?
A	other side please
C	you said you'd bought the ticket
A	no I've bought the one for
C	oh I see
A	so actually it can be either side is the right station side
B	where can you buy your ticket this side?
C	you can't
B	you can't you have to go the other
A	I think no I think there is an electric machine but that's like it
C	oh
A	which is fine actually but
B	do you tell them er do you tell them it's an extension and they give you a cheaper rate?
A	no no but it's only like three pounds mum
B	oh
C	they erm there's been a lot of trouble about people at stations not being given the best price but this comes to like we just expect people to research the best one there is and you think why? I dunno I mean it's like with our price list our price lists aren't price lists at all they're all up for negotiation with farmers
A	yeah all of our typesetter prices are up for negotiation
C	yeah so
A	yeah
C	the best
A	but it's like my ticket to
C	yeah it is
A	now it's like a hundred a hundred and
C	yeah

C	mm

A	upwards
