A	just to an Indian restaurant round their way
B	how's
A	yeah she's good she seemed you know perkier yesterday
B	oh that's brilliant news
A	she seems yeah she seems er it's really helped
B	that's fantastic considering we thought that was it
A	yeah I know
B	that's brilliant it's amazing what they can do and she's obviously very strong strong minded so that's I think that seriously helps
A	oh my god
B	yeah he's very positive and he doesn't seem to let it get him down or anything like that and they said that it's erm contained so it's not spread anywhere else so he's just got to have them removed again and they don't seem too bothered about it and he's not having chemo treatment or anything like that they just scrape it out and remove it
A	yeah
B	and just keep a regular regular checks on it
A	what about that spider bite he had?
B	yeah he's still got that erm
A	I emailed him
B	which is
A	so yeah
B	that's nice which is erm healing
A	oh it is healing?
B	I think I think I don't know what the latest is on that
A	no of course I mean he's he's fairly old now
B	seventy-seven
A	yeah
B	yeah seventy-eight this February
A	he's been in good health
B	yeah if you I mean he still cycles in Spain er apart from like he said he sent a message to
A	no
B	or something like that so he's kind of trying to make light of it but the last couple of years he's just been in and out of doctors visits and hospital visits and but they do get really good treatment out there so
A	that's good
B	so that's good so I never got to say you said that you caught up with grandpa when you were home before you moved back down to
A	oh yeah he gave me a call
B	oh good
A	and we had a chat
B	good
A	a chinwag
B	oh that was nice then
A	it was good yeah
B	just got a message on my phone from
A	oh okay
A	did you skype him?
B	er no just rang him cos I had some post so I just rang him anyway but he's had a cold this week erm
A	yeah
B	he's going in at twenty-four and not eighteen
A	he'll save himself some money I'm sure if he does it that way
B	yeah and as long as he comes out of it with his degree and a career then
A	yeah
B	but er he says he's getting on well with his housemates and the house is nice we're going down next Sunday
A	oh nice
B	er looking at the journeys it's gonna impossible to do a day see you and see
A	no yeah I'm sure it's just an addition
B	it would have to be a stopover or
A	yeah
B	have to do it that way I don't know what the train fare's like from
A	it's it's ridiculous
B	from
A	absolutely ridiculous
B	is it?
A	it's sixty miles it takes three hours
B	what?
A	three hours on the train it's ridiculous
B	it takes three hours from
A	from
B	oh my goodness
A	there's a two and a and a two and a quarter hour slow as train to
B	oh you're joking
A	to
B	well the only thing
A	it's ridiculous
B	we can do is if
A	yeah
B	come down and and see you
A	sounds good
B	cos it's just the I didn't realise how large
A	oh it's a big big state
B	yeah
A	it's one of the biggest in the country I think
B	I know I didn't realise I thought when you were in the
A	I mean as the car goes there's only sixty miles between the two of us
B	but it's saying it's a
A	yeah it's the roads it's all like A roads and stuff
B	yeah yeah
A	around there so it's
B	so it's like what is it? two and a half down to you?
A	yeah
B	and then another hour forty well that's no it would be two and a half to
A	an hour and forty and then another two and a half
B	say two if it's traffic
A	you won't get home
B	I know
A	yeah it's too much
B	so it's it's I mean obviously
A	it's like seven hours of driving in one day
B	obviously it's great that you're in the country and I can see you more frequently anyway it's not like going to Korea or anything but
A	no no I'm here
B	we'll just have to do it as a weekend thing just to
A	yeah so it's fine
B	if he's stopping with you we'll we'll get a Travelodge or something
A	I'm pretty booked up over the next few weekends
B	I know you are but I'm talking about next well
A	I think I'm gonna be a lot better next semester
B	yeah
A	I think it I'll be more on top of things and cos at the minute I'm sorting out you know moving in and getting the water done and getting the my council taxes and
B	oh really?
A	sorting out and trying and other
B	yeah yeah just feels a bit full on does it?
A	I'm doing erm more modules this semester than I'll probably do next semester
B	yeah
A	so it's just a harder semester I think
B	well if we get down on the twenty-third I know you've had
A	twenty-third of what?
B	November
A	is that the plan?
B	well we've just talked about it briefly but if you feel you're gonna be too full on with
A	I'll have a look on my calendar
B	yeah
A	we'll have a look I've got my calendar with me so we'll have a look later and see if
B	yeah I mean we can discuss that nearer the time anyway
A	yeah
B	so don't worry about that just see how you go
A	I'm gonna be home a few weeks after that though aren't I? so
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean er
A	yeah
B	er so I don't think that would be the same for every Sunday
A	yeah hopefully not typical there's road works on the
B	oh I know
A	or the rail works and
B	I did ask if that's the norm for a Sunday and she said no
A	no it's not
B	she said it's just erm
A	that's on there
B	they're doing maintenance
A	great
B	yeah
A	never mind
B	mind you looking at your dad's message to
A	yeah
A	and he got lost in London
B	yeah nightmare
A	yeah not good
B	but erm never mind
A	no he's just got a new one for his birthday cos he doesn't trust the old one so
B	no I don't think I would trust them fully anyway
A	no
B	I think I'd still like to have a map in the car and know where I'm going
A	yeah definitely
B	are you feeling hot?
A	yeah it's a bit warm
B	is that better?
A	did you do a fart?
B	no did you?
A	it smells
B	oh that might be the air con
A	did you?
B	yeah I have er I can't have much sugar I really can't
A	good
B	it upsets my stomach big time now it's weird since I've gone on this kind of low carb although I've been having more carbs lately
A	well that's not a bad thing
B	no it's not it's good
A	avoid it
A	yeah about his stomach he mentioned that to
B	yeah but he's already been he's been to the doctors here and had tests and it's come back clear I just said to him well if you're gonna go ask them just to check you for dairy intolerance because that's what he seems to think it is
A	yeah
B	cheese and yoghurt and a lot of people get dairy intolerance
A	I mean he's bound to meet people on his course isn't he and
B	yeah he went to lectures he said there was like a hundred and forty odd people in the the lecture hall and it's a big university and he's been going to the gym so
A	he's never been quite as social as I am has he? so
B	no
A	he'll er
B	no
A	he'll figure it out
B	he'll have a smaller group of friends I think
A	oh he's just gotta make friends before friends get made
B	yeah
A	I've told him that before it's important to make as many friends as possible at the beginning because within a month or so they're gonna have their divisions
B	they get into their kind of groups yeah
A	and they're gonna decide that these are their friends
B	mm
A	but he'll erm he doesn't really listen too much does he? he just
B	no
A	yeah
B	hopefully when you get to kind of a certain age you do kind of listen to some things
A	did he?
B	yeah he's erm they're very very good down at where he goes and that they were doing like in a general
A	yeah I've heard of them
B	and they erm broke them into three kind of areas age range and ability and then he spoke to us last week and he called out about six lads and he said right I wanna try at eleven o'clock on a Saturday erm setting you up and maybe creating a team within for your age group erm so we went there at eleven today which is much nicer than rushing out for nine o'clock in the morning
A	yeah definitely
B	erm and it was really really good there was only six of them and he got them positioning properly and passing and thinking about where they're passing and all this stuff so he loved it
A	good stuff
B	and he did he scored a few goals and did a few cartwheels
B	I know well he's doing gymnastics now at school
A	oh is he?
B	he does dodgeball football and gymnastics after school
A	he's involved in a lot
B	yeah and then tennis on a Monday
A	it's a lot of work for you guys
B	well the school ones are okay because I
A	oh so it's additional?
B	yeah
A	they don't have to do it?
B	no well I have to pay for that after school club
A	oh you do?
B	erm
A	how much is it?
B	er I don't know but they're the actual sports clubs are like three pound a session
A	yeah
B	so they just take it off what I pay for the aftercare club so
A	mm
B	I'm not paying any more
A	no
B	which is good I wouldn't have done it otherwise
A	you would have had to have paid that then because you couldn't pick him up
B	yeah
A	and so he'd have had to stay in school regardless
B	yeah yeah
A	I understand yeah what do parents do about that? when the school finishes at three and people don't finish work until five or
B	well they do what I do pay for the aftercare club but I think it's if I can pick him up by quarter past four I think it's six pounds that I have to pay extra
A	oh
B	pay cos you know he goes into breakfast club as well which I have to pay four pounds in the morning because I have to start work at quarter past eight so
A	that's a joke everyone has to start work early
B	yeah
A	and then finish late
B	yeah
A	but you have to pay more for that
B	I
A	it's quite a long day for him though isn't it?
B	yeah it is but he goes in there and if he hasn't had breakfast at home he'll have some toast there or breakfast and then just plays with his friends but to be quite honest it's worked really well for him because he didn't settle completely easily when he first went to school
A	yeah
B	into his classroom so he's found that easier sorry
A	yeah it can't be easy can it for a little child adjusting to school?
B	no well we thought he'd adjust really well because he was like the top dog at nursery don't forget he's been going to nursery since he was nine months old
A	yeah
B	for the first six months I don't know if I told you but for the first six months in my lunch break I used to run over and spend twenty minutes with him and run back so I never got a lunch break it was just like I needed to be with him
A	oh my gosh
B	so I used to sit on the floor and play with him and everything until he went up into the bigger group
B	it was horrible cos that it made me feel okay about leaving him because I'd go over at lunchtime but erm
A	all this effort you put in and then we get older and just start shouting at you
A	well
A	you and dad take a completely different route don't know where we are
B	what route does dad take then?
A	I don't know I just don't recognise
B	so does dad go that way through the village maybe?
A	yeah yeah it's this that turning there's a there's er is there a bridge over there?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah so all I've done is
A	he he goes that way
B	kept on the road and come round this way
A	yeah he always goes that way
B	yeah I wonder if he comes back this way though cos I'm not oh you can get back through the village and
A	I've never seen him drive this way
B	cor my toe's hurting
A	yeah how is that?
B	bruised still swollen still
A	any less?
B	erm
A	or would you say it's just the same?
B	no slightly less I think slightly less but it swells up
A	that's not much of an improvement though is it?
B	no
A	over the last two months it's like
B	no but it's erm it's a difficult one isn't it really your foot cos you're using it all the time
A	mm
B	it's better when I strap it up
A	is it not strapped up now?
B	no
A	yeah
B	I don't know I don't know just give it time if it hasn't improved much more in another month I'll go back to the doctor's
A	yeah
B	but from talking to other people I've just you know they say it takes months and months to sort out so just have to bear with bear with
A	I mean is it possible it will never heal?
B	erm
A	I mean if you keep using it
B	I might have to have physio maybe I don't know
A	mm
B	but the trouble is it's still like it's still bruised so until the ligaments and there's like god knows how many around the joints erm go down it's not gonna get any better and in my sleep sometimes I
A	ouch
B	but it's annoying cos I wanna get back to running and doing stuff
A	yeah you can't even walk on it properly
B	no no if I go into town if I strap my foot up I'm okay walking into town but by the time I come back I'm limping again
A	yeah
B	so I can't walk too far
A	can you go in a wheelchair?
A	no
B	I'm okay
A	then you'd feel old wouldn't you?
B	yeah I can walk around the house better just with flat you know nothing on my feet
A	oh bloody hell that guy
B	really?
A	well he stuck his arm out at the last second
B	idiot
A	erm kind of smoking at the minute
B	oh are you?
A	just thought I'd let you know
B	oh okay
A	yeah not heavily but
B	how much?
B	oh yeah
A	a few a day
B	does it help?
A	er I need to stop again and
B	mm

B	so have you spoken to
A	very very briefly I haven't really had any time have I? so
B	no
A	I'm not gonna have any time to this afternoon either and er I won't have any time tomorrow either
B	well you'll have some time when we get back in when we're doing dinner you should see this
