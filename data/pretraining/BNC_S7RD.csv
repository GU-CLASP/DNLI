C	mm an idiot
A	it's raining cats and dogs

A	oh is there a Labrador?
B	I think either there's two versions like when animals used to go hide in the eaves the inside structure of a house then it rained really heavily they used to kind of drop down
B	that's what one theory is but the other theory is that sometimes you do get strong rain storms which lift things up from one place and put them down in the other so there was a time where it was raining frogs cos frogs were and raining fish raining fish
