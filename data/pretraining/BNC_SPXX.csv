B	well just a few days
A	so you only had like well like five four or five um
B	it was just a like a few days
B	well you go to Europe and then like um the good thing about Europe is so you put the days in and it shows you like the main graph it's like the Euro against what
A	the Czech Koruna
B	but then underneath they have all of the like
A	no it's you know there's a few
B	there's the Swiss Franc

B	Estonia has a different one
A	yeah Yugoslavia's got the Kroni or whatever uh

A	yeah
B	oh that's right yeah
A	you you start a bonfire on top of one of them
B	put your like a
A	put your your your hock inside it
A	uh and then you know in in a like a cover of some kind
B	yeah
A	put it in there
B	some interesting ideas
A	and uh it'll it'll have a really smoky flavour
B	yeah
A	um
B	or
A	but yeah we could also you know um
B	could just slow cook it and it'll be
A	go on a  go on a  somewhere you know like
B	yeah
A	uh
B	not sure where
A	and and we're supposed to get a tent what we could do is get a tent and then uh
B	temporary tent?
A	and set set it up like next to  next to  the ham hock like in the park
A	you know if you've got a tent that's good
B	ah we should do that I looked at so many
B	we really should decide
A	um drugs
B	drunk?
A	uh they're just hanging out
B	ah it's annoying isn't it?
A	some wrestling
B	it's not what you want
A	uh blokey stuff
B	I hate blokey stuff
A	sorry what were you saying?
B	really gets on my nerves
A	what? Blokes
B	blokes yeah
A	uh they'll they'll they'll have they'll die out eventually yeah
B	has he got a Burberry cap on?
A	no it's it's just  it's just  green
B	I hate caps
A	you mean baseball caps?
B	yeah
A	not not like flat ones? D'you like flat caps?
B	I like a flat cap on a on an old gent
A	unless it's  unless it's  a Burberry flat cap
B	ah he's pretending to do something very rude to that man over there
A	he's just in a happy mood uh
B	well
A	uh
B	he's come into like the pub with all of his tools on his tool belt as if that's some like masculinity display
A	either that or uh like a porn film
A	whoa he's just
B	you've obviously I wouldn't know so
A	yeah well no but no uh uh
A	yeah
B	ah it's bad
A	is that that's the first line? I'm looking for phone
B	no that's not the first line
A	no phones in here just just me the shower
B	alright this is taking an unusual turn
A	sorry about that
B	um but he spent so long looking that and his research was so extensive that actually by the time he'd got anywhere new things are on the market you know? His research was so he took so long comparing all of the various possibilities that actually it was like one of those never-ending cycles like
A	yeah
B	if you compared everything in that much detail like you would never get to the end cos there would always be something new
A	yeah
B	in the end he did he he did buy one yeah yeah yeah
A	but he did  he did  get one in the end didn't he?
B	but I don't think he was very happy with it
A	oh was that one of his that was one of his factors?
B	yeah
A	well
B	just like
A	I think I mean I
B	like you don't charge it for like ten hours do you?
A	just sort of like because you have to charge yourself once a day
B	you do have to charge yourself
A	yeah so when you go to bed
B	yeah
A	and um leave it on overnight
B	well that's one thing actually the Blackberry that I took to Brno it did last a really long time
A	yeah the
B	no I don't like the
A	that that thing on the smartphone's really good you know the the Swype thing which is uh
B	swype
A	really it allows you to to use a very little amount of energy for uh to to get through
B	yeah
A	so I think it would allow like potentially really fast typing uh that's what I was saying before
B	I think there's loads of stuff I don't even know like
A	well some of the things that are a bit annoying is is like apostrophes and stuff like if you're saying it's a good day today or something
B	I think it does that though and and I think it does  it does  learn like it does um
A	oh yeah well it certainly learns vocabulary yeah
B	Cos like some of the stupid things that I say like owt and nowt and like how man and like little
A	yeah
B	yeah it does do it's
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and sometimes if I've like got an email in me mind that I want to send
A	yeah
B	I'm sure it can't be very good
B	I should get a better technique
A	well I guess you've learned that technique you know somehow so
B	but I feel like our office is so quiet sometimes I feel like I'm being really loud like
A	but I know that the way you type like you you don't put your fingers in the right  in the right  place so uh
B	yeah but I think it's one of those things that once you've learned  once you've learned  it like
A	but uh
B	actually I it's because I've got like um
A	uh
B	I type with actually with more of one hand than the other
A	yeah I actually have I do too much with my left hand and
B	so you do a lot of like control and stuff like?
A	control in with the left
B	yeah
A	whereas I should share uh share the control like
B	well I didn't even know for ages that there was like even like control and shift on the other side like I didn't even
A	sorry?
B	I didn't even know for a very long
A	you didn't know where well I didn't even know there was a control on the  on the  right side so
B	ah well
A	I only
B	well that's what I'm saying
A	no no I thought you  I thought you  used uh oh right
B	no
A	when I do shift I always use the right one I think like
B	do you?
A	often always use that
B	oh I don't
A	whereas when I use control I always use the left
B	I try and use more keyboard strokes like there's some I really like some of the alt ones I really remember
A	oh yeah yeah
B	they're like create create bookmark and insert bookmark
A	oh those are really useful yeah
B	yeah
A	uh but but like it's not
B	yeah
A	but uh you know to do a lot more stuff but I mean I recently worked out how to do like to do a macro that went through like a a whole folder of files um in you know through Word
B	you did what?
A	could do that with Python before
B	oh in a folder? That's useful
A	I mean I could do them with Python but uh I didn't know how to do it in in Visual uh in Visual Basic in Word but but you can do loads of uh like if you're using um Word or Excel or Access you can do loads of like um
B	yeah
A	uh useful macros in uh Visual Basic
B	well that's what I
A	yeah I mean I think there's always an easier way to be honest like and until unless you're at the very vanguard of technology
B	always
A	like um
B	yeah
A	like like you know like
B	like I
A	well unlikely there's there's some some things you might
B	no but
A	it it you may there may not be a free uh available one or whatever
B	yeah
A	but uh no I mean uh
B	yeah
A	uh yeah
B	ah his perfume was so strong
A	no not not
B	ah really strong
A	what?
B	when you can like taste someone's perfume after they've left
A	ah right no I didn't get that but uh
B	did you not?
A	yeah in well in your mouth's pretty bad isn't it?
B	you're like
A	it it just feels weird doesn't it?
B	sorry I didn't mean to cut you off
A	that was  that was  doing his uh
B	oh his cat
A	Cos he's he's just won
B	yeah yeah yeah he's cat thing
A	the cat thing and uh uh Saddam Husain thing and um
B	ah that was pretty bad
A	I think well
B	yeah
A	that's I guess he
B	oh he's awful
A	explain like
B	oh he's horrible
A	why what made him do that but uh that was his own choice so
B	ah it's so cringey it's so hard to watch
A	Cos he he chose to go on um um to go on Big Brother
B	big Brother
A	but he  but he  chose to
B	come across well
A	yeah it's pretty pretty silly isn't it? Like but his performance against the uh against that tribunal though or whatever it was was was really great
B	oh in America
A	yeah
B	congress
A	that was really good I liked that
B	that was quite funny
A	yeah so like where where where was the band then?
B	just through there see where that birthday party is?
A	oh yeah
B	there
A	the place is much busier on a Friday than a Saturday isn't it?
B	actually it was  it was  quite busy on Wednesday you know like
A	oh really?
B	maybe people come down for the band you know like
A	oh yeah yeah
A	yeah I mean there's a
B	everyone likes a bit live music don't they?
A	yeah I haven't seen a live band for a long time I don't think
B	well these ones were alright like they started like the first half
B	yeah that was Thin Lizzy but
A	whiskey In The Jar
B	that was but You know what I mean that like
B	that's Dire Straits isn't it? Sultans Of Swing
A	oh yeah
B	so it was more that sort of which is very listen-to-able
A	yeah
B	um
B	not my choice but harmless background-y fine
A	well yeah yeah
B	and then it got a bit weird like then it was like
A	yeah
B	so that was like a bit out of place
A	right
B	it got progressively weirder
A	then rocking actually yeah that type
B	yeah but it started off being like quite nice and then ended up being a bit like aw and like you know that song that was on the Keane song that was on before Eveyone's Changing
A	like oh Keane yeah
B	and like uh Coldplay and all that kinda like floppy sort of
A	some floppy stuff
B	really not my sort of thing that sort of rock rock in the very very very loosest sense of the word
A	yeah
B	rock with a very very much a lower case R like
B	you know What I mean that sort of like?
A	yeah no no I
B	sorry?
A	I didn't realize they had cover bands in this pub so
B	uh every Wednesday apparently
A	I mean I knew they had them in the Portland over there but uh I didn't know about um
B	quite a different calibre of band I feel
A	yeah they were always sort of loud metal bands and more sort of rock um
B	I don't think you would get like a covers a cheesy Keane covers band in here uh
A	no I guess not
B	it would be like The Virgin Mary's like Suspenders or something in there like some stupid like
B	industrial
A	like
B	bleeding From Within yeah yeah yeah
A	well what was it? Suspenders and what?
B	I dunno
A	but there's a pub just down there
B	you know but the
A	it's like there's like a fish tank which is strange cos not pubs don't normally have fish tanks in them
B	like
A	you go in there right and it's like
B	like we've never been in
A	the fish are bored
B	we've never been on a Friday night though it might be like jumping that might be the place to be
A	uh I dunno
B	no but we've only in
A	get ones with
B	yeah
A	uh
B	I don't mean now
A	yeah we can see so
B	so do you think we should go next door now or d'you think we should go like or stay here or?
A	um
B	it's always kinda cold next door which sort of gets on my nerves
A	what time is it uh I've it's twenty-three eighteen
B	it's always a bit
A	they they close at the same time don't they cos they're obliged to
B	it's always a bit  it's always a bit  cold though that's one thing like
A	yeah
B	yeah it is cheaper but it is
A	not much atmosphere
B	not much atmosphere
A	yeah cos you know it's like Wetherspoons um based on George Orwell's idea of what a good pub would be
B	yeah
A	and he didn't like music in pubs which I don't really agree with that so like
B	no I think it's good to have something background-y
A	like but but but like
B	God
A	entertainment uh
B	so annoying
A	so yeah is it uh is it the barman no it's someone  no it's someone
B	yeah it's like some lads pulling hilarious lads' pranks
A	I was uh cos I think they know the barman I think something like that
B	well
A	anyway um
