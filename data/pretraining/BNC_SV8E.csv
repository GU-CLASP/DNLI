A	you can just delete them and they come up in order with the time that you took it on and
B	yeah
A	and you can even name it and everything so
B	definitely
A	it's a very neat
B	I don't even know I don't even remember why I have a oh no because I I record the retreats on my phone as a backup cos we have like an official
A	mm
B	of Anadi when he gives talks erm but sometimes it fails for whatever reason
A	you just have to
B	record it with my phone so so I I downloaded this application voice recorder application on to my phone but I didn't you know consider the options at the time I just quickly did it
A	yeah
B	whatever came up first but maybe it's just not a good app
A	mm
B	I Sellotaped my tweezers together
A	I've got lots of pairs of tweezers
B	I need to buy some
A	well no I've got lots quite a few good ones
B	oh there
A	so and I've got a little mini pair that you might like
B	I've got a big grey streak coming through
A	woohoo
B	I'm not old yet so it feels that it's unfair
A	it is entirely unfair
A	has she er has she got quite a few?
B	she dyes it but you you when she doesn't dye it you see
A	I know she does the the
B	she's done highlights hasn't she?
A	yes and a rinse dye
B	yeah
A	that's what I used to do for a long time
B	that'll do yeah but when she doesn't dye it she's got quite a few
A	I've been interested seeing as I've got my little blond locks
B	oh yeah
A	to actually see that I've got quite a little bit of dark still
B	oh yeah
A	very little but a little bit of dark and certainly at the back er so I will have some colour
B	yeah exactly
A	erm I wish you could have like a very thick tooth comb and just go like that and that and put a brown dye in that much you know
B	what like yeah
A	just like brown streaks
B	as if it was brown
A	it's as if it was brown
B	yeah I think you just need to go to a really good hairdresser like once
A	I will I will
B	and get them their advice about it and maybe the trick seems to be to dye it grey
A	somebody
B	if you want it yeah
A	yeah dying but I don't really want to do that
B	no no no as a as a step through as a stepping stone through
A	yes
B	and then you know it doesn't matter if you have to go to the hairdresser a couple of times a year
A	yeah I think once this has been cut now there'll be a lot less of the yellow might go a tiny bit shorter
B	yeah
A	and just get rid of quite a bit of yellow
A	erm but no I know what you mean if I if I twice a year had some kind of nice highlight
B	that's what I mean
A	that would be a nice thing
B	like yeah you don't want to be again having to go every three weeks
A	three weeks dyeing my hair dye it grey
A	I can provide that on my own
B	I know it's a bit silly
A	it'll be recapping the weekend
B	yeah
A	so I I'm I am we've got four songs three big up tunes for this slot while everybody's not bothered waiting for their results
A	erm three the three big numbers are erm Let's Get the Party Started which is just a fun
B	mm
A	erm called it is well with my soul and erm a man so it's a complete contrast so none of those Barbershop songs which is quite nice
B	oh that's cool yeah
A	they're they're just great songs
B	so you're not doing Barbara? or that's your
A	oh so that's our competition piece with a another now we don't know which
B	Babs
A	erm presumably it'll be what we did last year
B	yeah
A	and we do those first thing in the morning on the Saturday we're called the mic warmers
B	yeah
A	and they get judged so we we're taking six songs erm to the contest so that's quite a lot to get good
B	that is a lot to get good
A	so it's good
B	so you've got
A	so
B	have you not?
A	it's a Sunday erm so we've got another full day in four weeks I think we'll be That Maning tonight cos we didn't do much of that as well as recapping what we learnt from the weekend
B	yeah
A	erm
B	it's cool that she's so ambitious isn't it?
A	yes
B	so you feel like not just that you're having a nice time but that there's a kind of goal and
A	yeah the just a couple of weeks ago the music team had a whole day erm session called basically the way forward
B	mm wow
A	so they had a whole day planning how they can raise the standards of the chorus erm sounds pretty good doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	I think it's going to involve us erm recording ourselves
B	oh yeah how did that go? have you listened to it?
B	cos you went last time I was here it was
A	the CD
B	yeah
A	we do you know? we're really quite shocked
B	where is it?
A	cos the guy his job is get the erm the the the sort of proofs through to us if we're going to be selling it at conventions supposedly
B	I know
A	erm and he supposed to have got the proofs through and they go back and forward and back and forward and he's still finishing off some other chorus's CD
B	no ways
A	and we've not even heard the proofs yet so and he keeps saying no it'll be fine don't worry well they're they're really worried
B	don't worry
A	the music team wanted to you know? really have time to do some editing
B	that's annoying
A	yeah
B	so you've not heard it?
A	so we've not heard any of it yet no
B	I'm going to
A	and we had erm we had
B	oh yeah
A	design the cover he was going to
B	oh right
A	and we've seen the proofs of that it's beautiful
B	mm
A	erm
B	so are you going to sell it on Itunes as well?
A	I doubt it no I think it'll just be a word of mouth selling erm I'm going to turn my side of the heating apparatus down so feel free
B	yeah it's quite warm isn't it? the sun's actually shining so
A	yeah so if you turn this down it's the coolness of the air on your face
B	right
A	so and then it comes out of here and so you can have cooler air on your face which is sometimes nice
B	is dad going to let you upgrade the car? never?
A	erm well I plan that
A	erm when he
A	I've made a plan and dad has made a plan in his head
B	good for you
A	no we've
B	which is?
A	which is erm that erm I we dad and I always assumed we would just take his whole pension package as a monthly salary and when he went to the retirement sort of course that erm was provided erm they talked about options of taking lump sums of different sizes and you can take a huge lump sum the maximum is about half a million pounds so we're talking huge lump sum
B	as a percentage of your pension?
A	as a percentage of your pension and then you get a lot smaller pension monthly and you invest the lump sum or do things with the lump sum whatever you want to do you know so you could use it for certain things to start you out and then invest the rest and erm they were saying if you if you just invested it and you got is per cent per annum of it will be investment then it would entirely replace the money that you had missed
A	monthly yeah
B	monthly but the plus side is that of course you also have half a million pounds to leave to your children instead of your pension is gone when you've gone do you see the difference?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so you've actually got half a million pounds you're not losing out on your on your pension or monthly salary but you've got this lump sum as well
B	yeah
A	which perhaps later in your life you could start using
B	to what degree is it going to reduce your monthly income?
A	er well it does reduce it quite a lot so what we need to do erm dad went and talked to the bank of course erm and what he really talked about was what sort of investments he could do so that we wouldn't touch the lump sum at present and we would replace any of the money that we lost erm with you know a a moderate risk investment erm and I I'm just really nervous about the whole thing like you know I I want us to feel really comfortable monthly and not have to worry about that
B	definitely
A	erm cos dad's personality is such that if you had a lot less that he could you know cope with that
B	no he couldn't
A	and also that dad you know his whole tying everything all up scenario means you then are
B	I was just about to say that
A	living on less and you can't get at the benefits
B	I was about to say if you took the lump sum dad's tendency would be to lock it up somewhere
A	absolutely and we wouldn't be
B	and you'd be on rations and eating beans on toast
A	yes this is the whole thing that worries me
B	you have to figure out what your monthly
A	so we need to decide that by next May so we've got time
B	you have to you have to maybe er figure out what your monthly
A	yes
B	expenditures are you know I know it's hard to tell
A	no that's right
B	because things change but roughly you know because I imagine it's quite a lot
A	it it's funny because we we've since we've been living here and dad was so worried about the money and that's what I want to wipe away I don't want that
B	absolutely yeah
A	erm it's in his nature to be worried
B	yeah
A	about it and but it it made life hard because we weren't we weren't relaxing and enjoying we you know we haven't been on a big holiday we didn't do all these things and I want to do all the adventures you know while we're young erm
B	of course well that's the goal isn't it?
A	and that was the luxury that we what we'd earned over all those years of of working for it
B	yeah
A	but this year I don't I don't I don't feel that at all I feel
B	no it's depressing
A	I have to think about everything if I want to give anybody money I have to think about it you know I have I have to you know I haven't got much myself so I haven't got that liberated feeling er so it it needs a lot of thinking and
B	yeah
A	a lot of
B	yeah well that's
A	we don't have to spend all the time cos I think I probably got into quite bad habits erm you know and now I I realise I you know we could still sort of be luxurious without being wasteful
B	yeah fair enough I do wonder though like
A	yes
B	two-thirds
B	and you're not earning but you don't have a mortgage
A	no that's right
B	and what else don't you have?
A	erm so what er we we just don't have the mortgage that's the big things
B	yeah that's the big thing so
A	erm which at the at the
B	which dad was paying off at the rate of
A	so it was about two and a half thousand a month dad was paying off so he could get rid of it
B	so two and a half times twelve is like let's say thirty grand a year
A	and and then that's after tax you know so erm I think what dad worked out
B	I'm just saying whether you would you know you're roughly in terms of spendable money
A	yes what he did was
B	what's the word? expendable income whether you are going to have more or less the same as you did when he was working
A	I think that's what he worked out and what he forgot was that my salary was
B	yeah
A	erm and there was something else erm he forgot to think about erm
B	not at all and that's you was yours
A	and that was mine and erm
A	and so I think he forgot that we would be losing that so we will be a little less well off but then eventually we will get our pensions at sixty-seven I'll get my pension which will replace a bit of that erm
B	like you say like it's no well it's important to to for dad to get his head around that cos he's got this weird mentality of like I'm on my pension but it just doesn't really apply does it? if that's the if that's your pension he's not getting a state pension you know so he he has he has to kind of acknowledge like that you're just as well off in terms of and then he has to have some some pots that are accessible for things which are like
A	yeah
B	extraneous expenses like for instance when you move you're going to have to buy a lot of stuff
A	yeah yes that's right
B	furniture decorating the natural
A	changing the house
B	changing the house yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah and that's not going to be part of your monthly outgoings right?
A	mm
B	it's not like a monthly thing so there has to be somewhere from
A	no that's right
B	he has to know you don't mind really
A	no
B	it's just for dad it's just a case of like having it in his mind you know because he somehow feels as if he doesn't have money which is completely ludicrous and it's just because it's not accessible
A	no that's right
B	so he needs to have accessible bits for the purpose of your spending and enjoyment allocated I guess that's what this big pot would be wouldn't it? if you took the money out first at the if you took the the pot from the pension and then
A	yes
B	kept the rest for monthly instalments
A	yes erm
B	yeah you want to keep some of it sort of like liquid
A	mm that's right or something that's paying you a monthly dividend or paying you
B	yeah
A	a an annual dividend that you divvy out I don't know but erm
B	yeah so the bank advised him to take the pot did they?
A	well no the
B	oh
B	pension fund said that the majority of people took the lump sum and these were the reasons but erm they they also talked about the reasons that are very hard for dad to get his head round which are that you actually do something with the er pot like that you use some of it right at the beginning for some things that you've maybe always wanted erm that you know anything
B	yeah
A	erm that you had a plan of what what what would be nice to do with this money
B	to do with it yeah
A	it's such a huge amount of money erm and so funnily enough that's what the bank manager reiterated he said you know to take this huge amount of money to invest is erm it's not really the only way you should be looking at it that you should be looking at the money as what can I do with it?
B	yeah
A	er for me
B	yeah
A	erm and invest it but you should maybe have a plan of what why would you take it? you may as well just have the luxury of knowing you've got this money
B	yeah
A	I don't know it's
B	oh
A	erm so I'd like to be
B	yeah you should be
A	mm I I my one criticism of dad it's a kind of a
B	makes all the difference
A	negates
A	the whole conversation we may as well just wait till we find out you know erm and you you can have things like capital gains tax which is huge tax like forty per cent on erm one one of the pots of money that he's put away we will be have to have capital gains if we release any of it I was like really? you did that? erm and then he said well we can have so much a year without
B	he's very clever but he's not he lacks common sense
A	he's not practical no
B	and that's very typical of very intellectual people
A	yes that's right
B	like they don't know how to tie their shoelaces you know it's like that kind of thing so it's I mean I do trust him to know what he's doing but on the other hand
A	I do he does tend to miss
B	cos your decisions could actually your input could actually be really really valuable
A	absolutely so I think I'd like to be part of the next
B	well now it's kind of more the share shared income isn't it as well?
A	yes that's right that's right
B	so you want to
A	I had to laugh dad set himself up do you do you remember you got all this money all of a sudden and then it disappeared again
B	oh yeah
A	so he set himself up in a with a bank account cos I told him if I was having four hundred a month he could have four hundred a month and erm
B	four hundred
A	I know it's hilarious erm he could have this princely sum and buy all his blinking CDs with it
B	Amazon orders
A	Amazon stuff and everything and immediately he set it all up but he put all of the extra money into his as well and I said no no no no no no no no so that was what that all was that was him supposedly transferring all the extras into his account no that's not how it works
A	so we need this nice weather for
B	I know
A	no
A	no it's going
B	I mean he's been to England a couple of times but to London
A	no but that's London that's not England
B	and watching to watch the footy
A	okay two big cities
B	you know that's their reason for being here
A	but you were saying his family are quite city people
B	yeah they are yeah they've never been to the Lake District erm yeah so it's nice that it's kind of bit quintessentially English
A	completely different
B	I know but you can't hope for these things
B	made with boiling water
B	yeah
B	he always likes my Englishness and thinks it's funny yeah it's just nice to have him see things
A	mm mm
B	there lot there are such places in England there's plenty of things going on in England of that nature but we just have quite specific requirements in in the size has to be quite big
A	yeah
B	it all has to be quite big and er other things and also it was expensive I mean it's more it's more affordable especially at the moment for people to pay in euros if they're coming from other countries you know but yeah so then I was imagining everyone coming to England it was quite funny
A	erm that's what my dad always says I can't understand why
A	there's all sort of wacko people is more or less
A	there's plenty of religions going on you know she should surely find one that she likes
B	wackos
A	it's the
B	I know no that's what he's he's thinking
A	saying there's all sorts you know I
B	yeah well that's yeah that's for sure
A	there's bound to be something she could have
B	there's something for everyone a lot of Buddhist places in England
A	mm
B	it kind of makes sense to people here
A	yes erm I think it all well I don't know when I was younger and more involved with the Catholic Church it was the religion that people defaulted to from Catholicism
B	yeah interesting
A	erm it is you would imagine they'd go to Islam erm to me
B	yeah
A	erm but no no they went to
B	well there are certain crossovers like there are mm
A	yeah
B	which are more kind of erm
A	mm
B	whatever that kind of
A	horrible yeah I must give him a ring today
B	it's good that he phoned you
A	it is I'm really glad he did
B	mm
A	I think
B	yeah that's good
A	mm
B	it's nice
A	it is lovely it's a bit of glow
A	yeah
B	a bit of glow yeah
A	when you put that other one on it didn't do anything
B	it was very deadening wasn't it?
A	mm
B	mm
A	no it looks lovely when you just turn round
B	purchase some more it's a shame the SPF is so low for me
A	mm but you could maybe put sun cream under
B	sun cream under yeah
A	and then put it on
B	you can get erm moisturiser nice moisturiser with a high SPF as well just I mean I don't know what the problem is with sun cream it's fine as well it's just sometimes it's a bit greasy
A	it's just not yeah a bit bit
B	and shiny but it's better than nothing in Thailand they put erm whitening in everything
A	yeah everybody wants to have pale skin
B	it's really weird and so all of the moisturisers that they sell are have
A	it's not good for you either yeah
B	bleach or something
A	you shouldn't put it on you
B	I wouldn't I don't want to be whiter
A	good girl
B	and I certainly don't want to put bleaching agents on my skin but you see some women in Thailand I don't know what they do they put some kind of a mask on I think and they have like a literally like a white round white face that's like a different colour to the rest of their body
A	no horrible
B	I'm not sure what the deal is
A	erm oh no it
B	is it this one?
A	yeah it's can you see that it's still working cos I I just didn't know if erm if it lasted you know like
B	oh I see yeah
A	seven three O one? yeah?
A	yeah
B	it just goes on until you
A	oh good
B	say say stop
A	excellent
B	erm shouldn't be a maximum really should there?
A	no I I just have never tested it so I didn't really know how it works
B	I suppose when you er special it's quite good that
A	erm when dad and I just passing
B	really?
A	and I haven't said it to him except that I I said that erm I didn't feel anything about it except negative things from being near the cotton mills and the er and also it it's like a strange weird thing but as if it's a a barrier being the other side of the M6 it's all
B	a barrier to what?
A	like like I don't feel near to
B	like on other side
A	I don't on the other side it's just a weird thing but
B	no I think one hour either side of
A	yeah that's true
B	so it's not really a factor
A	not but I I did I liked it and it was beautiful but I it just felt like a a very foreign place erm like I didn't I didn't know where I was
B	yeah
A	erm and my dad I suppose that it it kind of made me realise when we said to my dad we were looking near
B	why?
A	why would you want near
A	and of course it is
B	well yeah
A	but but just ten minutes outside it's absolutely beautiful but then you could say the same about a lot of places
B	yeah especially around here cities aren't nice are they?
A	no but
B	oh good I mean maybe you would feel more at home in
A	yeah that's right it's it's kind of weird isn't it?
B	so it kind of makes sense I mean er yeah I mean I don't it makes more sense to me that you would be this side of the of
A	but we're going to keep the house
B	well if you do then yeah
A	er so suppose what might happen if we went to
B	yeah no I think you're right no that's
A	erm because then you could go up to the Lakes so why would you why would you do a
B	no you wouldn't keep the house
A	no
B	unless you wanted to have it in the family but even then it doesn't really make sense does it?
A	whereas south of
B	mm
A	it it there's a lot everything will unfold and what I think will happen is you find a house and you and that is the key factor
B	yeah that's what I said to dad as well that it's going to be house that probably decides it a little bit you know
A	yeah that's right
B	I can imagine you in sort of erm south
A	no that's absolutely right
B	it's prettyish but it's just kind of plain
A	yeah that's right
B	but you would get better climate and you would get erm access to
A	that's right
B	south of you know
A	mm
B	I mean
A	you have to kind of not
B	I know you don't I know
A	you know it it's true but it's going to be a few years
B	yeah
A	not you know
B	no I know it's not like er
A	you can't think of a lifetime er but
A	dad's sisters erm no that's not right not dad's sisters erm my
B	did they?
A	incredible isn't it?
B	you have the genes
A	we definitely have something going on
B	ninety-seven crikey
A	and
B	yeah that's pretty amazing
A	a little bit confused at times but not
B	yeah but so's grandma to be honest
A	yeah absolutely and and we've seen that deteriorate
B	yeah
A	and I think you know everything's changing in her life so that does cos the
B	it's destabilising yeah
A	the confusion yeah that's right
B	yeah I did notice that with grandma when we went to see her last time that she wasn't she was much more confused and kind of foggy
A	yes
B	and after we'd been there for a while she was better
A	yes
B	I guess that she's on her own and that you kind of withdraw into your mind don't you
A	yes yes absolutely
B	so she looked a bit confused for a while and she didn't really understand really what was going on and the kids were jumping on her and things but erm but the later one she kind of returned to herself it's just all the emotion as well isn't it?
A	no no that's it I've seen her a little bit worse each time that we've gone
B	yeah I think it's being alone as well
A	I agree yeah
B	is that it's just er what happened to grandad because of his hearing I think he just withdrew into his own world too much and then it makes you er it makes you lose orientation
A	totally mm mm
A	no no
B	dad seems like he's doing better though
A	yes yes
B	than last time
A	very very much so
B	I was quite worried about him
A	mm
B	and last time he was still quite depressed and
A	yes
B	he was very tearful about about grandad
A	that's right
B	and just not in good form you know like kind of kicking off against you a lot
A	that's really really
B	no but
A	changes
B	yeah I noticed yeah
A	so it's been lovely
B	his skin was so bad and everything
A	yes
B	that's cool
A	no it's been lovely erm to just to see him
A	I you know for somebody so devoted to his work it'll come I'm sure
B	yeah
A	he's still on holiday kind of
B	it's still kind of a novelty isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	but you know when he we were saying about the Norwegians and the that they went home at four o'clock you know that would be horrendous to him
B	yeah yeah
A	he would have he would think they were not doing their job
B	yeah
A	he would be angry he would like think oh these people have no life
B	have a life yeah
B	well that's good
A	no he he's er
B	I thought about it the other day I was just thinking he never has to go to work again what's he going to do but he's you know he's good he's doing a lot of music
A	yes
B	and playing every day
A	that's right
B	which is cool
A	erm
B	and er I hope he does some more you know has a few clubs or something
A	he said he was going to go to the squash tonight
B	oh really?
A	squash if great over the winter and they have a squash ladder oh you clever girl you pinched a plum
B	I should have brought I'm sorry I took it with my breakfast we can share it
A	no it's alright erm er what were we saying?
B	squash club
A	squash erm no that would be just great it's a good winter sport and they have so I was going to say they have a squash ladder so a league you join probably at the bottom but you just play each other at that level and then you move up if you're so you don't have to know anyone you know you just get to know them as you go
B	that's nice well that'll be perfect
A	and it's a club and of course it's at the rugby club you know just opposite the
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	erm so either they'll have a bar in the rugby club or they'll probably all go across the road to the
B	well I hope he erm meets his match and he hasn't played for a while
A	no well he did play in
B	oh really?
A	just once a week if they were both in the country was kind of how it was working out there were a couple of different people he played and they were a bit better than him so he used to be just pleased if he came home and he got a a a game
B	got a set yeah
A	set or whatever
B	whatever it is
A	yours were fairly limited yes
B	poor dad he's not been able to enjoy that with his children
A	no funny isn't it? and yeah well
B	he didn't go did he?
A	no he didn't even go no I quite enjoyed it
B	you were there with the
A	interesting
B	that's going to stay there for a long time probably
A	well I didn't know whether to now dad's bought a whole polishing kit but I was going to take the car for a good clean it's in desperate need
B	yeah it is
A	he wants to clean the windows and clean the cars so he's obviously wanting to give himself jobs and I just want to take the car for a proper clean
B	dad's not going to do the serious job that you need
A	he went out with a bucket
A	to clean the car and that was about three months ago
A	it's only fifteen degrees still
B	really?
A	it just looks beautiful
B	it does look beautiful that'll do that's enough
A	looking is all we need
B	bright sunshine yeah
A	as long as
B	I told him to bring warm clothes he doesn't really own very many well he does but he leaves them in India he doesn't have to use them elsewhere
B	he said Spanish parents are fine cos Spanish and Israelis are pretty
A	yes probably closer
B	equally rude
A	mm
B	I can imagine that
A	yes where he doesn't even feel at home in England
B	yeah
A	it's kind of weirdness
B	yeah exactly it's like we were saying about Germany where you feel that you kind of get what's going on in reverse well he can speak very good English that's a very lucky thing for me that's a like a bit of a barrier not for the
A	yes
B	kids not for the family family cos they all speak very good English but the well first of all you know they speak Hebrew to each other a lot
A	mm
B	so you miss
A	mm
B	what people are saying and half the time you aren't involved in the conversation
A	no that's a little bit disconcerting isn't it?
B	it's fine cos I'm very used to it but erm it's just a factor you know in in er when you're when I'm in er with er when I'm with them
A	yeah
B	with his family that I don't really understand what's going on some of the time and then I just kind of switch of into my own thing you know and they're very polite like they always try to speak English
A	mm
B	if I'm there and even to each other when they're not directly addressing me
A	yes so you're still in
B	but you know it's your family so you just default to your own language don't you?
A	yes if you've got something to say quickly or urgently
B	yeah or even if you're just chatting and it becomes animated which it usually does in Israel
A	I hope he gets dad's humour I hope you've given him a whole load of warnings
A	oh Mr
B	and yeah with the kids like I can't talk to the kids at all
A	yes
B	so that's a shame cos they really want to you know
A	yes to chat with you
B	to chat and tell me things and they'll just chat to be in Hebrew
A	mm
B	I have no idea what they're talking about I just go yes but
A	oh right yes
B	so she erm speaks English to her daughter
A	okay
B	sometimes as well her daughter clearly is a very clever girl and can clearly understand English actually she doesn't dare to speak it but she's only four
A	yeah no but that's that's quite nice yeah she she gets what you're saying
B	but you can tell that she understands what you're saying she was much more shy by the end she she would come and babble at me she knew all the words to the Frozen songs so we were singing them together
A	yeah yeah oh lovely
B	it was cool
A	erm not always so we'll just see erm I'll text
B	so we picking him up from school?
A	yes we'll probably have to go straight there
B	eleven O nine what time is oh ETA
A	twelve
B	twelve and what time is it?
A	twelve
B	oh twelve
A	it does just near the end and then an extra few minutes but you can't walk through the school you have to walk round and it takes a good five minutes
B	erm
A	so yes I know where to go in
B	no but you know that you can park on the entrance way that opens to the
A	yes
B	and this is the house
A	yeah
B	and you can park there on the road
A	yes
B	but you can also go all the way round to the other side
A	that's what you have to do you're not allowed through
B	I see
A	at lunch time so if you decide to walk it you've got to walk all the way round as well
B	oh rubbish
A	erm and that's why you need to be a bit earlier erm than this so I'll we'll just drive there and pick him up even though we have no seat to put him in
B	oh I see what you mean yeah we being thirty seconds and
A	yeah erm a funny thing I went for her last time and
B	oops
A	and er
B	yeah she's not in the other classroom isn't she?
A	she did didn't she?
B	mm it's funny with her though I don't know if it's just kids thing but you ask her a question like what kind of snacks do you buy at school then? you know she gets her thirty P and she just like completely makes up the answer
A	makes it up I know
B	yeah what's that about
A	I don't know
B	I'll say what did you do at school I mean sometimes she answers you know there are certain questions where she just
A	no says we went on a coach trip
B	yeah
A	did you really? erm so when it was really funny because we were erm and then she would say that's a lie
A	erm and you're not really supposed to tell lies you know? and I was completely baffled but the erm on her birthday
B	oh
A	because I'd just like to really be sure that it's okay because the teacher didn't say that I I'm not sure and I'd texted
B	oh no
A	so we went and changed her in the toilet
A	oh funny
B	it's quite
A	no no no no
B	and something in her is not like connecting the dots
A	a little bit naughty
B	do you think it's naughty?
A	no I do yes it's just like a little story
B	she's like I have macaroni and this it's like no you don't have macaroni as a snack
B	yeah we do
A	no that's right
B	have macaroni
A	once you've questioned it
B	right
A	it's the little naughty story
A	it's like an an imaginary thing that then it becomes a lie and they don't really they really don't know quite what the lie is
B	not sure what the difference is
A	yeah why is it different to tell a story
B	oh I see yeah
A	do you see what I mean?
B	yeah like if you'll ask her so what did you do what did you see when you went on safari?
A	yeah
B	she might just invent a story about having seen a giraffe
A	totally she she told no she told me something ridiculous erm
A	in safari
B	mm yeah
A	funny isn't it? but I think sometimes it's the things that are also maybe a little issue like erm
B	okay
A	and she she just says no she doesn't want snacks and I think there was a little bit of a tussle going on so you wonder if that comes into it
B	yeah yeah
A	that she's then sort of thinks you're part of the spying team
B	the conspiracy that want her to buy
A	with the snack snacks yes I see what you mean
B	yes
A	oh just
A	emergency heat required
A	oh right yeah
B	and I'd be like how much does it cost and he'd go six and I'd get another thing and how much does this cost? and he would go six
A	full shopping experience
B	full shopping experience erm she erm made a pet store with all of her little cuddly toys and erm she telling me all how you need to look after them but the funny thing with her is that she tells you what to say
A	I know
A	I refuse
B	no pretend you're the mother and you're buying a kangaroo for
A	and you're saying yeah yeah
B	your daughter and you're saying that she's very special right I'm buying a kangaroo for my daughter
A	I just say no I'm going to decide what I say you decide what you're going to say
A	oh okay
B	it's a little bit annoying
A	if I yes
A	you can't even think
B	I knew it was like that with Barbie's but erm
A	no it's extending
B	she just fully dominates the storyline
A	I
B	it's kind of quite oh cos that's
A	a crud cruddy bit
B	crud cruddy bit is kind of coming off my face
A	well it's maybe where it rubbed into your hair or something
B	no no it's just dry and it's dry skin which is coloured with the crud
A	well that's no good
B	in general though I quite quite like this
A	it's busy
B	it's
B	and it isn't very comfortable is it?
A	it's not very comfortable
B	I was noticing that cos he was driving me to the station and it was quite
A	you get all the bumps
B	it's very bumpy
A	it's quite bumpy
B	it's all bit race car
A	it's just vroom
B	yeah
A	I don't feel calm
B	I don't feel calm especially with dad driving
A	and dad is you know and then he decides to overtake people
B	yeah
A	erm and I don't feel quite so relaxed and whereas in this car everything happens smoothly and you don't have that same race boy feeling
B	I think you've just got to let him have it
A	in yourself
B	you've got this one
A	so I
B	that you enjoy it
A	the joy of going out in it
B	yeah I agree
A	it's actually quite nice to drive yourself
B	I was going to say exactly that maybe you should just take it out
A	yeah the
B	yes
A	I'm sure this is not the idea
B	it's not Los Angeles is it?
A	but so if I go out in it cos it's a sunny day I just tootle along quite nicely and it feels really nice
B	yeah that's fun
A	but if dad's going at sixty you feel completely buffeted
B	yeah I know I don't
A	I don't
B	erm it encourages that type of driving as well
A	I think that's what it does yeah
A	I know
B	I feel very handicapped and I just don't see when that's going to happen
A	you need to come back for a
B	for a few months
A	few months at some stage and you you're you're right there you know you're just right there and it
B	no I know I just need to de-traumatise myself
A	absolutely and get get somebody really good
B	yeah
A	and just take your time do do it properly don't rush yourself
B	yeah it's rushed isn't it?
A	erm and just say you know what I can already drive I just need to refresh and get all those little details that that guy just didn't seem to have a clue about
B	he didn't know any of it and he didn't teach me some of the main things either
A	he didn't teach you properly at all
B	on the way to the first test like the night before I'd been studying and er realised we'd never done an
A	is always done
B	so I was like we've not done an emergency stop on the way so you just don't feel you know
A	oh totally not
B	any confidence
A	no shame
B	I don't I shouldn't really have failed so badly I just
A	no but it got worse
B	no I just lost all my confidence
A	yes exactly
B	and he kind of
A	yeah and that was one
B	that was
A	the second one was worse than the first and the third one was a write off
B	no the second one er the second one was good I thought I'd passed
A	ah
B	the third one was a write off I don't know why I didn't pass the second one I was obviously not ready because the first time he said you're too hesitant
A	mm
B	erm the second time he I can't remember his reasons I think I might have made a major error
A	you made yeah probably
A	yeah no
B	so I obviously had good control over the car I just felt
A	to be honest I think it's
B	uncomfortable in certain situations and I think I still would
A	yeah but I think that's erm
B	like traffic
A	yeah you hadn't had that yeah
B	and he should have just taken me to
A	no absolutely and
B	yeah
A	it's not a nice place
B	well that's what everyone else was doing
A	no but even if you drive all-round the town and keep including the route
B	yeah yeah it was and I think erm you I could have just done with being driving
A	no all of that should be cleared up shouldn't it?
B	massive crossroads and those things
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly
A	erm to over and over and over and over and over
B	if er if I'd just had a month or so more I could have done it it was just
A	yeah that's right
B	I could easily do it I don't doubt myself really cos I was always quite comfortable driving but erm just not the situation's not arisen but this kind of scenario just makes me feel frustrated that I can't drive and when I'm in Israel same you know
A	mm
B	like I keep thinking I can't do things a lot of things or it's just more difficult to do them and I always feel like erm dependent on other people as
A	but I I you know would it be of any benefit to do the test somewhere else like
B	yeah maybe
A	in I I don't mean benefit but would it be easier like if you passed your test in England would you be able to drive in Israel anyway?
B	yeah I don't know you have to do the international license I think so or you have to do an additional thing maybe to convert it into an international license yeah well this is what I thought you know that I could do it somewhere else as well I don't know how easy it is to convert one to the other
A	no
B	and I just need to be able I just need to drive for while
A	yes
B	the good thing about England is that you can drive without
A	on the provisional license
B	on the provisional whereas in
A	no
B	you have to be with a driver
A	you can't in Holland either oh you can't yeah you you here you can drive with a family member can't you?
B	or anyone with a license
A	anyone with a license that's right
B	yeah no but in Israel you can't drive at all unless you're either in a car with an instructor or you're not
A	no
B	already passed you know so
A	you should get it in erm the US of A
B	I know just go there
A	you just pitch up
B	my friend
A	I remember you saying how bad she was
B	it was crazy and she just er more or less batted her eyelids at this little dude and you know there was like one street in that town you were driving up and down it a few times that was how she got her license but she was a liability
A	no that's also not so good
A	you know you may kill yourself but you've got your license
B	well it's very surprising that she's alive her method of parking was to get out of the car and ask a man to park for her
A	you're joking
B	no
A	bit bit rude
B	and she was there and I said she'll be fine she'll be fine and he was like telling me funny stories like they'd been driving together somewhere and she'd arrived at a roundabout and she turned to him and said is this a roundabout then?
A	oh oh
B	it was quite fun though
A	oh shit
B	oh what?
A	dad's still got the key
B	oh shit right no problem we'll just get in touch with
A	oh if you it's just
B	erm hello? there we go
A	oh god
A	erm on the Whatsapp
B	we can pop over
A	erm
