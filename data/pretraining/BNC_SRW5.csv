A	aye so that erm
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	very good yes
A	I
B	yeah yeah
A	even the Pole To Pole had that kind of
B	yeah
A	just him
B	yeah
A	okay it's the Hemingway theme but
B	yeah yeah I I found it interesting cos I didn't know much that much about Hemingway so
A	alright
B	found it really interesting to find out I didn't realise he was so well travelled and that he'd been so many places and you know fought in the wars and and all that and I was like I really enjoyed it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I mean
A	it's good
B	you know? his I hadn't really put it all together his time in Spain and
A	yeah
B	didn't even know he'd been to France to be honest
A	no
B	aha
A	cos that bit
B	yeah
A	I hadn't really read much about
B	yeah yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah? aye aye
A	yeah kinda under under the line kinda place yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	really
B	yeah
A	yeah America as you think of it erm
B	no no
A	it seemed just a bit marginalised and a bit kind of forgotten about
B	yes
A	I dunno if it still is or maybe it's been redeveloped since they did cos it's it's
B	yeah
A	like fifteen years old that book isn't it?
B	but maybe that's what he liked though eh? because then when he went to visit Montana in the end? it was just middle of nowhere
A	bit too
B	middle of nowhere stuff you know so
A	yeah
B	not read
A	like I said about Sahara
B	yeah of course
A	on my old haunt
B	of course
A	well he's on when he's
B	right I'll remember that
A	and erm
B	aha
A	such a mix of cultures going from
B	yeah
A	he's I think he starts in Afghanistan
B	right
A	then he starts to rise in the Hindu Kush and stuff like that
B	aha
A	and then he ends in Bangladesh doesn't he? like in the in the basin
B	ah
A	er the Bay Of Bengal or something isn't it?
B	right
A	so er aye that's that's very very good
B	I look forward to that one yeah yeah
A	er have have you seen the TV series?
B	not well not for those two but for the
B	mm mm
A	the Himalaya one just cos it's
B	mm
A	and
B	right
A	you think of it as a short cut well it's just a mountain range but it's not really it's like a massive
B	yeah huge
A	thing er
B	like Sahara I guess
A	I don't think he goes to Bhutan in that
B	oh right?
A	cos Bhutan would be a good one
B	maybe it's closed off
A	well it is they they
B	aha
A	who'd been in Bhutan
B	mm mm
A	and I remember like nobody at the time had that idea and
B	right
A	of course he came in and gave a presentation about it
B	oh what was that an exchange
A	no no he he was Scottish
B	right aha
A	but he'd lived in Bhutan for a year
B	right
A	and erm
B	jesus
A	cos there was that big controversy I think when Prince Charles took his entourage and like
B	and that was it? for the year?
A	well they kind of
B	oh aye oh aye
A	but there is erm
B	I can imagine
A	but there is a I was reading something about Bhutan having like
B	right
A	I can't remember if the book covers it or not
B	oh that sounds good
A	yeah
B	that sounds good
A	yeah yeah
B	for nothing
A	seriously yeah yeah just like sky scrapers
B	but then no
B	no one lives in them
A	yeah
B	they have
A	that that's that that's what happened on the edge of
B	right
A	where erm
B	no
A	beautiful flowers
A	in in the central reservation
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	going up and down
A	within a three
B	right
A	I dunno
B	but no one
A	well er
B	d'you think they can keep that up then because is it not? are they not starting to have some sort of difficulties now?
A	I think that there's a I think there's a lot of corruption in the in the in the building industry which is what keeps it going
B	mm mm mm mm
B	they've obviously got fantastic infrastructure eh but
A	yeah yeah
B	now now the erm
A	yeah I think it takes time it takes time doesn't it?
B	mm mm
A	they take five ten twenty to build up so who knows?
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you've got the erm
B	yeah yeah
A	erm Sahara's a good one
B	mm mm
A	I need to read that New Europe cos that's the one I never
B	aye
A	got to see properly
B	that was good
A	Eastern Europe
B	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
A	Romania Croatia stuff like that
B	yeah
A	did you see any of those Michael Portillo train journey
B	I've seen the odd one not the series but I've seen the odd one yeah yeah he's quite good
A	when he goes to Europe?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah he's he's he's
B	but he's quite good at it so
A	got bit of panache
B	must be better that than he is at politics or was at politics seen as he got
B	yes
A	did he go back after that or was that him?
B	er
A	cos he's been on that politics show for years
B	er
A	yeah yeah like
A	I dunno almost
B	yes
A	he did er Derry To Kerry
B	aye he did a couple of them and presumably they liked the idea
A	onto the onto the Kyle of Lochalsh or
B	yes
A	something like that
B	but then you said they wanted someone else to do the Palin role first but he turned it down
A	it was originally gonna be Alan Whicker eh?
B	right
A	and then it was another guy and he was third choice or fourth choice or
B	right
A	something like that
B	it's amazing to think eh it could've been someone else
B	who knows what would've happened so
A	no
B	it's filled a hole for him in his career anyway
A	yeah
B	cos I never saw him in his
A	did you have a look at the the
B	yeah yeah I've not read it yet it's on my
A	yeah
B	it's on my shelf
A	well this is it you gotta take the time to digest it all eh?
A	yeah well you gave me that one on Saturday but
B	yeah yeah
A	erm I'm I'm
B	what book's that?
A	erm
B	ah
A	yeah
B	you're gonna become a Buddhist?
A	mm
B	is that not quite full-on?
A	yeah
B	you're like giving up drinking and food and stuff
A	well not all food
B	not all food
A	I've kinda become semi vegetarian eh
A	like I
B	mm mm
A	maybe maybe once a week or something yeah but like erm I don't know
B	someone at work saw the salad I was eating and said where's the meat? how can you eat it without the meat?
A	er
B	so
A	I don't miss it eh
B	well
A	no you get enough nutrients elsewhere as long as you're eating eggs and
B	yeah yeah
A	getting the protein and stuff
B	well aye
A	chopped up
B	chopped up bit of tomato bit of egg
A	yeah
B	oh really? how so?
A	I just prefer the taste eh?
A	like
B	mm
A	if if you have a steak I mean?
B	mm mm
A	erm but if if you eat fish
B	mm
A	aye but you don't have to eat until you're heavy
B	yeah
A	there's a difference isn't there?
B	aye absolutely
A	you could probably finish
B	absolutely
A	like most meals you could probably stop three quarters of the way through but like
B	I'm fine
A	there's always that thing it's it's on my plate
B	yeah I better eat it oh I did that tonight I probably
A	it's there
B	I'll finish it yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's a lot of that erm
A	it's up to you
B	you take what you want so if you want more meat you have it
A	aye so it's that thing if it's like
B	yeah yeah
A	and take too much
B	yeah yeah
A	especially
B	yeah yeah
A	it's just heavy cos of the cream and bacon and stuff
A	yeah
B	so
A	ah it's alright took you two days?
B	yes
A	no erm
B	dunno if I could give up meat
B	good on you though
A	and erm the
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and all that
A	yeah
B	all that malarkey
A	but it does work
B	surely it requires discipline?
A	yeah
B	I'm not gonna be a Buddhist
A	yeah so
B	that's like going to the gym
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
B	cos can you both? can you can one of you be a Buddhist and the other one not or?
A	yeah yeah mm
B	d'you reckon?
A	I think she she finds it more difficult not to kill mosquitoes when we're in China but
B	oh really? so you try not to kill animals? but could you like?
A	but I've been doing that for a long time as I've
B	yeah
A	like erm
B	yeah
A	I learned that from
B	yeah yeah
A	he erm
B	yeah
A	you know? are a pain
B	but are you
A	you can try you just try and get rid of negative thoughts yeah
B	really?
A	that's that's
B	but
A	on a practical level
B	but you love your own team
A	yeah that that that's fair enough but I mean that that's different as long as you control it within that
B	yeah yeah
A	I dunno we'll see but yeah I see that that that
B	all
B	someone's annoying you at work or at home you have to just be like
A	yeah
B	that sort of thing
A	but that that that's not just a Buddhist thing that's that's a
B	mm
A	that's a good attitude in general isn't it? walk
B	yeah yeah
A	a mile in the other person's shoes
B	get on with it
B	yeah
A	so
A	we'll see what happens
B	aye interesting though
A	er
B	right
A	I haven't been able to pick up that Scottish football one
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah the Buddhism one's quite a heavy one eh it's over a thousand pages
B	how long will that take you to read then?
A	I'm about well I've been I've got three four hundred in
B	got plenty of time to read
A	no it's just I go to bed and I
B	right
A	and fire through with it
B	right
A	this new job it's been easier to
B	right
A	cos I don't have to prepare lessons or anything so
B	ah right
A	ah my eyes start to get heavy after after a few pages aye
A	and quite often I'll I'll I'll
B	yeah yeah
A	and then
B	don't know where you don't know where you are yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	no I know that feeling
A	I don't I don't like the new touchscreen Kindle eh I I miss my old one
B	oh really?
A	ah
B	ah what were there? buttons at the side?
A	yeah
B	that's what I've got the buttons at the side
A	I prefer that one eh
B	right
A	when I was in Spain last year
B	aye
A	erm
B	the old one aye yeah yeah you
A	whereas with the touchscreen
B	aye
A	different gestures on the screen so if you swipe
B	right
A	to the left or
A	or if you're touching the top third of the screen
B	so it's usual they try and make something
A	well it's it it's probably sleeker eh but I did prefer the old one
B	there's unintended consequences
A	so that's
B	aye
A	I
B	well it's the same thing isn't it but just?
A	different brand
B	a different
A	but yeah access to a different store isn't it?
B	yes I don't even know what their store
A	they're they're they're pushed by WHSmith so
B	right
A	yeah
B	so they've just thrown their lot behind
A	makes sense though eh? if you can't beat them
B	yeah so they must make
A	yeah but
B	did you hear they the
A	mm
B	they had their worst year like
A	what the the e-reader or the tablet?
B	in ages
A	saturation
B	the point where
A	yeah
B	aren't feeling the need to upgrade to the latest e-reader
A	no it's the it's not like a an Ipad or something which gets faster I mean there's only so many things that a book can do
B	yeah
A	broke when I first moved to
B	mm mm
A	so
B	mm mm
A	between me breaking that one and getting a new one and it was only because I couldn't think of anything else to get from my mum for Christmas
B	right
A	said what d'you want? what d'you want? what d'you want?
B	get that
A	no cos it makes no
B	I mean I don't even
A	makes no difference
B	I don't even know if you transfer your books over
A	yeah
B	no idea
A	yeah all all the same books are available
B	right so if I've got
A	yeah
B	I get the a new Kindle all the books are there again?
A	yeah yeah
B	right
A	yeah they're in the cloud and you just download them as as
B	so they're aye so they're mine so I'm buying the
A	yeah
A	er in the same way that you can download the app to a phone and you can get the same book
A	I mean Ipad or
B	of course of course aye
B	I quite often have it on
A	yeah
B	that I've not brought
A	yeah that's that's that's the idea is that
B	yeah yeah
A	it's a mobile library which
B	yeah yeah
A	in the modern world cos
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yes aye
A	I don't think I'll ever lose that because you cannot share Kindle books that's that's a problem
B	no you're right yeah yeah like that Scottish football book pass it round people and
A	mm I don't know maybe there is a system I dunno
B	well there's a lending library a Kindle lending library that you
A	but I don't understand how that works
B	if you're an Amazon
A	yeah so you get you get
B	eighty quid? eighty quid a year to get Prime isn't it?
A	and like you can just get books for as long as you want?
B	well
A	or you
B	yeah I think you basically
A	well the cost
B	they'd only get say three weeks to read it
A	well eighty quid a year you know?
B	yeah and then after
B	afterwards it wouldn't be on your device as far as I know once you hand it back
A	well that's it
B	it just works like a library
A	yeah
B	you've got it
A	twenty-first century Tory libraries
B	no aye you pay for it yeah yeah you pay for them
B	see that's though that's it I still use libraries for for wee books so Irvine Welsh has got a book out
A	yeah
B	copy of this when you've found it and
A	or or you'd have to pay
B	aye eight quid
A	eight quid for a paperback or twenty quid for a hardback or
B	I I had a look at the
A	yeah
B	so if I wanna read that pretty quick
A	fair enough
