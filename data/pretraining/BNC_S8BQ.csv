B	right
A	a two week block and then you can but you know I I always like to have somebody that's been recommended and
B	that's right
A	so that's why didn't go to the gym I was waiting in for a man so cos I was thinking oh there'll be like a three month waiting list
B	mm
A	cos there usually is for good
B	oh
A	so
B	so
A	I'm already spending in advance so I'm thinking oh my
A	he's gonna say he can do it next week and I
B	that's nice that
A	er well
B	cos then you can
A	yeah
B	do things like this can't you?
A	yeah he's had it he's had it erm what's the word? confirmed I suppose they don't pay it
B	yeah
A	till May but he hit
B	yeah
A	the targets to to tell him how much he'll get so
B	he'll get brilliant
A	so that's nice so I said

B	oh lovely
A	a new bathroom
B	lovely
A	but it's just
B	and like you say with it being the one that everybody uses
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	mum was telling me about this erm thing they have in New Zealand everybody was raving about it called a shower dome but you can only fit it to cubical showers not to showers over baths but apparently it's some sort of Perspex type ceiling almost if you like to your cubical
B	mm
A	that keeps all the all the erm steam in and it doesn't er er I don't know
B	doesn't make a
A	quite how it works doesn't like let the whole bathroom get steamed up with and then cause condensation everywhere
B	yeah and everything
A	and she said she said she spoke to lots of people in New Zealand and they were all raving about them and how marvellous they were and how but you can't fit it over the bath
B	no
A	and in that bathroom
B	you need
A	there's just a shower there's not well there's not room to have a separate shower
B	are you going to have a bath again or are you
A	I want
B	just gonna have a shower?
A	no we are because I still have a bath
B	mm you do don't you?
A	I mean I am pretty much the only one but I do in the winter
B	mm
A	I do quite like it so no I'm not

A	gonna do without a bath
B	I find them very time consuming baths
A	yes but they're nice
B	mm
A	aren't they?
B	I get in and I I either get too warm
B	cos I'm getting too warm
A	hot yeah
B	and then I'm thinking oh

A	oh are you? oh
B	yeah after like you know very rare I have a bath
A	oh no I do still
B	no I can stand in the shower forever

A	you look a bit tired actually
B	yeah I do feel really tired
A	as if you haven't slept well yeah
B	and erm for about a week now well it not last Saturday the Saturday before I was working with

B	and last night I I kept waking up and I couldn't get back to sleep I got this violent headache which I've still got today
A	oh
B	so I haven't
A	have you taken anything?
B	really done a lot this morning yeah I've taken some Paracetamol
A	oh what a shame
B	yeah yes I feel like I've done nothing for a
A	well that's alright
B	haven't even emptied the dishwasher
A	that's alright
B	all the crocks are still on the side from what we accumulated last night
A	maybe somebody else will do it for you when they get in from school
A	will he?
B	mm he probably will bless him
A	how lovely
B	yeah yeah
A	my children wouldn't without asking
B	yeah he has
A	in fact there's
B	he has done it
A	a little pile of erm dirty PE kit on the floor in my kitchen
B	mm
A	that I'm refusing to move today
B	oh that's just been left there?
A	cos
B	no
A	pick that up
B	no no
A	but it's just there lying on the kitchen floor
B	well I've done nothing I was gonna get I was gonna get all my jobs done this morning and get on top of my washing and so I could do ironing tonight and everything and I've done nothing
A	oh that's alright
B	I've done nothing
A	it'll all still be there wait till you feel better and then you'll do it quicker
B	yeah
A	cos you don't do you
B	no no no
A	so do you think that stuff
B	I can't be bothered with it
B	no no
A	the Neal's Yard party? but
B	no no
A	do you think that sleep thing actually work? I'm very sceptical about everything
B	I
A	yeah
B	but er there are thousands of products out there that have
A	for years and years and years I must admit I'm not keen
B	do you know what I mean?
A	on the way on the way she's doing it at the moment
B	mm
A	with the whole
B	yeah
A	because it it's doing good things to you inside I'm thinking good things to you inside? you can't
B	no
A	say that and expect people to buy on that
B	no
A	it
B	no
A	good things to you
A	inside? I'm thinking
B	drink plenty of water it'll flush your insides through
A	yeah
B	and no I won't buy any of the products they're too expensive
A	well why why are you having the why are you having the party
B	just to give her experience
A	oh okay
B	yeah and I'm inviting
A	cos I think well I'll I mean I'll buy something there but er er
B	oh well I'm not having it because
A	there's not a lot
B	I want the products
A	that I want to buy
B	no I'm doing it to give her experience
A	yeah
B	cos obviously Christmas it was very er
A	yeah
A	mm
B	but I'm inviting like friends that know
A	okay
B	so she might on the back of it get a party
A	yeah yeah oh well that's yeah that's
B	that's why I'm doing it
A	but I just think
B	I'm not gonna use the
A	if I'm honest I don't really like the smell of the stuff either
B	no
A	there's been nothing that I've really thought mm that's really nice
B	and when you were saying about the smell it took me back and I'll always remember
A	mm
B	and I'd come back and like I was giving her a hug and that and she was saying oh you smell lovely mummy and it was obviously the creams
A	the cream yes yeah
B	you know that erm
A	yeah but there's nothing there was nothing that I'd really
B	no
A	so yeah I'll buy I'll buy something on the first but I don't
B	you don't have to
A	I don't really know what
B	don't feel obligated
A	that's why I bought the catalogue home really so I can
B	it's all so expensive
A	well yeah
B	I mean my my Olay is ten pounds a pop I only ever buy it when it's at five pound
A	mm
B	and when it's at five pound I buy two
A	two yes yeah I know what you mean
B	which keeps me going then till next time it's
A	mm
B	somebody's always got it on offer whether it's
A	yeah I know
B	Asda Wilkinson's Tesco's
A	I know I mean it's not it's not really the the price for me cos I do I mean the the Decleor stuff is as expensive is as expensive
B	yeah
A	I do but again I wait till I find it on on offer on the internet
B	yeah
A	I always do I never buy it I never buy anything full price cos at
B	no
A	some point somebody's always got and even if what I'm using hasn't quite run out I think oh that's a good price I'll get the next one
B	yeah
A	but I like it and I like the smell and I just think
B	yeah
A	I don't really like the Neal's Yard stuff
B	no no
A	not so far
B	I said to
A	did she like it?
B	and all the rest of it she didn't comment very much to be honest
A	no
B	I said just you know I said if you want to buy something it's entirely
A	mm
B	up to you
A	mm
B	but don't feel pressured to buy anything I said cos obviously this is
A	yes yeah
B	and she's aiming to get sales but don't feel obligated
A	mm
B	and she didn't
A	no oh well there we are then
B	yeah the thing is is it's once you start
A	well yes
B	you tend to particularly like you you've found a product you like you're happy with and all the rest of it
A	yeah
B	and you've stuck with it same as me with Olay
A	yeah it just makes
B	I I've stuck with it I could probably do with changing I could probably do with I dunno
A	but anyway well like you say that's her living so she's got to try and sell it to people but sometimes I think you need a little bit more of the science backing it backing this up here because
B	yeah
A	you can't just say that's good and that's bad and not
B	no
A	say why
B	no
A	like you say all these big name brands Clarins Clinque Estee Lauder I mean they have been around donkey's years really well respected er
B	products
A	and you just can't help but think do you know what? if they were bad for you
B	yeah
A	we'd have known by now
B	absolutely
A	they've been around for so long
B	absolutely
A	and they pump so much money into their research don't they? cos they
B	I know well this is it
A	they pump so much money into their research
B	yeah
A	and I was looking just out of interest this morning on the internet at at just
B	mm
A	oil or
B	that was the oil
A	well I I'm er doing that cos put it on I was trying it
B	yeah
A	it was that was where we tried it yeah
B	it was the one they said that goes down to your collagen
A	yes yes yes
B	and all that
A	cos I've got a serum a erm cos one of the ingredients they said was neroli don't really know what that is but the serum that I use from Decleor is called neroli oil so I thought
B	right
A	oh okay but I just looked out of interest what the ingredients were and there's asterisks by certain ones of them and at the bottom if there's an asterisk it means organically sourced so they're not not every single one
B	no
A	and there were definitely things that ended in ate A T E you know you just think well they're the they had the chemical sounding bits in there as well
B	yeah yeah
A	so I don't
B	no I
A	no no
B	I'm I'm doing it purely to support
A	mm
B	of doing her spiel
A	yeah
B	but to people that she doesn't know
A	no yes yeah
B	that she potentially could get a party
A	oh did she?
B	yeah and she said
A	mm
B	of her but she's not really a product user a big product user
A	yeah yeah
B	she's not is she?
A	no
B	erm so she she won't come she said but it would be nice to catch up
A	yeah
B	soon type thing
A	yeah
B	saw
A	oh
B	erm cos
A	oh okay
B	so he was he was walking erm I was outside her house and he was walking past
B	looking very lovely and all the rest of it and I said I'm ever so sorry to hear about you and
A	yeah
B	and he went mm and he went it just really got really just got too difficult
A	she
B	to erm and I said
A	mm
B	come to an end you know and he said well he said erm I think me and sort of all the girls just got just all got a bit too much and I said well at at least both of you have moved on and you haven't stayed with
A	yes yeah
B	I said which is a good thing and he said yeah and he said well he said erm I've stood by them I said I know you have I said and that is really lovely of you
A	very commendable
B	yeah I said that that just that in itself shows
A	mm
B	the sort of person you are
A	right
B	so
A	I yeah I er it was something to do with two
A	two years
B	excuse me
A	I
B	no
A	got to the bottom of it but I just know that he is paying at the moment for the house
B	yeah he said well they've got their home he said it's their home he said and I think they're happy there he said which is the main thing
A	mm
B	he said and I should be able to do that I said well that you know that is just so lovely of you
A	well it is
A	cos I mean he doesn't have to they're not
B	it's not their
A	his children he was never married to
B	no
A	they're not his children
B	and he's
A	and he's pay bought bought them a house to live in
B	yeah
A	really that he's continuing to pay it is it is commendable and not many men
B	absolutely
A	would do that I don't think
B	and he said erm he said oh erm he went out for a pizza with
A	oh
B	or the week before
A	yeah
B	he said which was very lovely he said it was very lovely and I thought oh bless him he obviously does see himself
A	yes
B	as a a father figure
A	yeah yeah
B	stepfather figure doesn't he to to take
A	yeah
B	like that
A	yeah he does
B	for a pizza?
A	oh gosh
B	and he said erm he said oh he said
A	but
B	you know what I mean? he said she's a lovely girl and I was just going
A	mm
B	I mean I don't I don't want to
A	just
B	you know
A	oh dear
B	erm
A	I saw
B	he said but
A	her briefly actually
B	you know
A	at the gym on Sunday morning
B	mm
A	she was having a little moan about him really just that he's
B	well yeah
A	so she said he's she's trying to move on but he he is sort of ringing and saying well shall we come round and he had his sister staying shall and she's like well not really because you know she's trying to move on but she got you know how she gets that sort of bit of a bitter look about her she
B	this is the one that the barn in
A	the barn yeah
B	yeah
A	by gym erm
A	you know she was almost like sounding a little bit resentful that he was doing all of that and I I didn't like to say it but I think blinking heck
B	mm
A	leave the man alone if he wants a new car
B	he's not obligated to do any of that
A	I know
B	I mean
A	but she wasn't very
B	should be
A	I know
B	to support
A	I know
B	shouldn't really they're his children
A	I asked her if they'd told the children about
B	oh yeah
A	she said
B	is he working? is he still doing that erm?
B	er I know it's awful to say because the circumstances you know when you're adopted and all that sort of thing and
A	oh no not to have him
B	not at all
A	living at home for what seven years?
B	yeah and doing nothing and
A	middle aged man
B	you know
A	forty living at home
B	no
A	no he hasn't
B	no and
A	yeah
B	you're not doing him any favours
A	mm
B	I mean I'm sure we'd be be the same with our flesh and blood do you know what I mean?
A	yes yeah
B	and I think sometimes
A	you're yeah
B	in situations of
A	I suppose so
B	kind of that they have had bad luck
A	yeah yeah
B	and you know bad luck at
A	yeah
B	birth and
A	and yeah you do
B	in in the early years and bad luck with marriage
A	yeah I don't know what'll happen but anyway so
B	but she's going away cos I invited her
A	has she booked skiing? she told me she was trying to with two of her friends
B	well she said erm
A	for a long weekend
B	she said she was hoping to go away and erm she'd let me know and I said well just let me know as soon as you know yourself so she text back and said er I tell you what then I'll so no but
A	mm mm
B	er cos I'm hoping to go away so I text back no problem who are you going away with?
B	I asked her
A	no her girlfriends
B	best mate mm
A	yeah no she mentioned that on Sunday morning
B	oh
A	cos she does miss that cos
B	he didn't actually ski with her though did he?
A	no I don't think I think she went off and left him didn't she?
B	yeah
A	cos
B	god
B	it's
A	oh anyway have you booked a holiday
B	oh
A	that you know holiday?
B	yeah
B	er guidance
A	guidance?
B	I thought I thought guidance
A	uhu
B	erm yes we we're going away the May half
A	oh okay they'll have finished their exams
B	but we're gonna see what
A	won't they?
B	the weather's like to up to the Lake District
A	oh yes?
B	to a campsite that sort of edges onto Lake Windermere
A	oh
B	so we're gonna take the kayak and just bum about
A	oh yes yeah
B	it's only five nights
A	oh that'll be nice then
B	very low key barbeque teas stop round the campsite on and off the lake but of course if the weather's gonna be naff there's no point so what we'll do is we have so many days whereby you can transfer your deposit
A	oh okay
B	so at that point if the long range weather forecast is not looking
A	mm
B	very good at all if you're going back to a brick building at night you can cope with
A	yes
B	less during the day
A	yeah you can you can
B	cos you know
A	yeah
B	it don't matter but when you're camping
A	no not
B	erm
A	if the weather's bad it's no fun then is it?
B	so if if the weather's really really bad we won't bother and we'll just transfer the deposit to our summer holiday which we're going down to Woolacombe
A	oh are you?
B	to do bodyboarding and
A	oh it's a really nice beach
B	surfing and that
A	isn't it there?
B	it's beautiful yeah
A	mm
B	a beautiful beach
A	mm
B	so we're gonna go down there for a couple of weeks camping take the dog
A	oh nice
B	primarily to do bodyboarding and
A	yeah
B	surfing and
A	cos
B	well and that yeah but she's going away with
A	oh okay
B	and they've got a house in Wales
A	right
B	and they're going so she's gonna be taking it with her cos they're going in the sea
A	oh wow my god that's gonna be freezing
B	it's gonna be cold
A	in blooming April well
B	said I'll be alright with my wetsuit on
A	oh gosh
B	must be mad so erm so she'll get to to use it for the first time then bless her
A	ah that'll be nice
B	yeah yes that'll be nice
A	yeah oh
B	she'll have a nice time
A	cos yeah they finish their exams don't they
B	when do they finish then?
A	before that before the Whitsun week
B	mm
A	did you speak to
B	no I didn't because I'd text
A	oh had you?
B	so
A	mm
B	and she said it was highly unlikely because they'd stopped it because they were being bombarded with requests so it was something they'd stopped
A	oh
B	and
A	oh has he?
B	so she said it probably very doubtful but leave it with me so she text back and said oh I'm really sorry
A	mm
B	but maybe next year if he needs to do it again which I don't think they do do they?
A	I've no idea
B	I don't think they
A	right so has
B	he's applied to
A	oh has he?
B	yeah
A	was it your suggestion then?
A	oh okay
B	he used to be a neighbour of ours in
A	oh
B	so I phoned up and asked the question and they said it is something we have done
A	mm
B	so he gave me the contact details of who we need to speak to erm and he's had an email back saying it's been sent his request has been sent on to the director and they'll get back to him with a decision
A	oh right
B	so maybe
A	it is yeah yeah
B	so he'll have the banter and just
A	mm
B	drop him in it and let him cope
A	oh that's a good idea
B	yeah he that's what
A	yeah yeah
B	it's what
A	good idea
B	so so I'm hoping that'll come off
A	oh
B	which would be a lot more of a probably more suitable to
A	mm be much quieter wouldn't it? and much more
B	yeah probably be more suitable to
A	be good for him yes
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I yeah
A	cos
B	I know
A	all that male banter he won't be used to that will he? that's why you're doing it
B	yeah
A	look at you look at that look on your face oh
B	yeah
A	how funny
B	expose him to
A	well it's a good idea actually
B	erm out of his comfort zone
A	he will be poor lad
B	he's gotta deal with it
A	oh you are funny we haven't really got any further with
B	yeah
B	residential isn't it?
A	and even when when
B	oh is that the manager who was there when we
A	yeah
B	were there and he came and met us
A	yes yes yes
B	yeah
A	who who is
B	see I wouldn't
A	yes yes
B	if
A	happy to send him up there but we
B	with
A	well I think
B	mm
A	which
B	yeah
A	I mean he's got a a spare room cos obviously he's he's got a family and they come and
B	yeah
A	visit so but it's we haven't really got any further with it but then we were talking because they have they had a tennis coach there who has now gone there was some sort of question over him some sort of I dunno something on his record that
B	oh
A	so
B	did he pass his one the other day?
A	er he
B	you haven't heard yet right
A	or at least he hasn't told us if he's
A	I haven't heard I I did ask him a couple of days ago and he said he hadn't heard yet but even if he hadn't that was to run tournaments though
B	mm
A	that's slightly different but yeah he's got enough he's got he's er he'll get his DBS and then he's got his first aid and he's got his next level of coaching which enables him to have groups of children so
B	absolutely
A	to the people cos I mean they're all
B	yeah
A	they're they're really wealthy people that the ones with their homes there so that you know and the
B	and but
A	week that it is at the end of July so our last week of term but obviously everybody that owns holiday homes there all their kids are at private school so they'd all be finished
B	so they'll be there
A	they'd be there
B	that's what I was gonna say if there's no children there it's pointless but
A	no they'd be there
B	yeah
A	so and the other and the so
B	yeah I erm
A	but that might be but it's just that one isn't it you know it's like it would be living I suppose in effect with
B	mm
A	would he wanna be on his own? and
B	that's right
A	up to the restaurant and
B	yeah where I said to like you like if
A	if they were together yes
B	they'd go off
A	yeah yeah
B	and do their own learning through the
A	at least
B	they've got company there
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	but I don't know we haven't got any further but I'll let you know if we do we'll see
B	mm
A	but he was I mean
B	mm
A	obviously
B	cos that I mean that would be a fantastic experience because one you're in a work environment and two you're also away from home
A	yes
B	they've gotta do your own cooking and
A	yeah
B	get you know get themselves up and out to work every day
A	yeah yeah
B	it's like a a mini university week wouldn't it really?
A	it would really
B	in in in a
A	yeah except except you're working anyway so we'll see nothing's really come of it
B	mm
A	yet but erm
B	well I'm thinking
A	he hasn't
B	when
B	yeah I'd love that
A	you'd be good at that
B	yeah very definitely
A	what will you do with
B	oh no he could come as well
A	oh I
B	yeah both of us
A	oh he'll be retired by then won't he?
B	yeah yeah well retired from the police
A	yes yeah

B	yeah
A	and leave them to it absolutely
B	yeah we should do that we should have a go
A	mm
B	have a long weekend away and
A	yeah we should
B	like mm
A	actually that's a good idea we should do that
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	be nice wouldn't it?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	did you get did
B	he did erm
A	okay
B	so he's given me the details and he's done some research and he does psychology was it he said? he's I think he does biology I need to I haven't read it properly
A	you need to look oh okay
B	erm and there's probably I'm sure he said there's about five of
A	oh really?
B	so I think he's highly recommended but he's thirty
A	gosh that's quite a lot isn't it?
B	it's a lot of money isn't it?
A	how many sessions would he need?
B	I don't know
A	do they do they do after school or revision sessions for biology?
B	well I think I'm gonna phone up and speak to them and just say
A	because most of
B	you know
A	well I most of them offer these sessions he had it was supposed to be another PE session but that was cancelled again after school last night cos miss had her netball match well last Wednesday's was cancelled cos miss had her netball match well why put them on a Wednesday if that's
B	yeah
A	the date of your matches? so he's supposed to be at one tonight for business studies but I mean they they they all said they they offer them and I've had a letter home er in the post today about sociology with all the dates that they're going to be offering them
B	I need to phone up and ask
A	so I I'm I'd be surprised if they
B	yeah
A	if they didn't cos all of
B	that's how you
A	mm
B	so we've offered you know to get him some help but at thirty pound an hour it's a lot of money what can you do?
A	yeah absolutely
B	you know it's what they're being paid for isn't it?
A	yes it is
B	I'm gonna phone anyway because erm and
A	mm
B	she can't control the class apparently she's under review by the school anyway
A	oh yeah?
B	and in the lesson the
A	gosh I thought they'd died out
B	I know
B	I know
A	isn't it?
B	so in the in the lesson she said they were all flicking
B	these loombands
A	oh
B	right?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh is she back?
B	erm she's back
A	oh
B	she said erm er alright miss wind it in
A	oh gosh
A	mm
B	established she said in he she said he's a really good teacher but
A	but they don't?
B	and then they don't she said I don't feel like I've learnt anything in maths since I went back September
A	oh really?
B	and I said
A	has has there been a parents' evening yet for year
B	and I'm gonna phone
A	for year ten? nine
B	we have had a
A	what year is she in?
B	parents' evening
A	ten yes
B	yeah and glowing report she's doing well
A	mm
B	you know she's she's conscientious
A	but she thinks
B	she does all the right things
A	she could be doing better
B	and I said to her I said I think I'm gonna have to phone and speak to your head of year did I tell you about?
A	yes you did
B	I told you about that?
A	you did
B	well she hasn't been and spoke about it
A	oh she hasn't? right
B	and I said I think I need to phone and speak to your head of year
A	mm
B	because of disruption in the class because basically the teachers can't do the job properly
A	yeah
B	so I'm gonna phone the school tell him everything that I know she said mum people have phoned and complained about the physics teacher people have phoned nobody does anything I said well I'll phone and I'll say I'm going to
A	mm
B	put in place to stop this happening because my daughter's education is not gonna be affected on the account of disruptive children the teachers
A	have you phoned them yet?
B	no I want to I asked her last night to write me notes so
A	okay yeah cos
B	yeah
A	that's the other thing you need the you need the facts don't you?
B	I need the facts
A	of what's going on you don't need to be yeah
B	yeah
A	well good for you
B	mm
A	actually no they don't seem to do supply teachers at A level cancel they just don't do lessons if
A	if they don't if there's no teacher like it's particularly on a Tuesday when he only has one or two lessons anyway oh so and so wasn't there oh she's not well or mm
B	and maybe nothing
A	cos one of the geography teachers erm
B	I don't know the name
A	but you know the
B	yeah
A	with the
B	mm
A	I mean I know the after school ones he keeps getting promised these after school booster sessions or revision sessions or whatever they're calling them and if they get cancelled well you you that's a bit of a grey area isn't it because
B	mm
A	they weren't obliged to put them on in the first place
B	no
A	but you know the lessons in the week they're obliged to put on
B	oh god yeah
A	mind you I remember when I was doing my A levels many years ago it was when all there was there was loads of teacher strikes in the you know in the eighties and I remember my mum and dad sitting at home moaning and complaining and
B	yeah
A	my children's
B	yeah
A	every other week we'd have a day off oh strike strike strike and we were
B	got
A	would sit at home
B	you've got
A	and work
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	on a strike day I'd be oh you
B	the thing is
A	oh yeah I know
B	want to learn because
A	yeah
B	it's a joke quite frankly I think
A	mm
B	an absolute joke
A	it's it's and then we wonder how so many kids come out of school without basic English and maths
B	I know
A	well it's not hard to gather because so easily for them to just slip through
B	yeah
A	the the it's just shoddy the erm
B	I mean the
A	the communication and the
B	yeah I know and in the classroom environment
A	the staff turnover
B	and it's the kids who are being disruptive are the ones that are getting the attention because they're being told
A	mm
B	off and you know and all the kids who are compliant are just being forgotten and you know
A	mm and at
B	right from primary level
A	last when was
B	no and then these
A	but there at you know year nine's always one of those years they don't focus on
B	no
A	because they haven't started their GCSEs yet have they?
B	no
A	you know they're choosing their options they
B	yeah it's
A	it was always one of those
B	it goes a bit by the by doesn't it?
A	it does really
B	year nine
A	bit like year four
B	mm
A	at primary you know they've done their end of year
B	yeah
A	years three and four a little bit
B	mm
B	yeah
A	but it it was just you know there was a like but like I said he the I didn't even get an appointment with science
B	I mean in many respects
A	yeah
B	but then maybe a couple of months in he should send a little report home of what when he has had the opportunity of getting to know them just send a little report over
A	yeah
B	of how they're doing
A	oh he he won't get that though will he?
B	no
A	yeah mm I know
B	and then these supply teachers coming in and I'm not I'm not being rude cos they're not all the same but they're very often doing supply work because they just want the convenience of going in
A	mm
B	when they want and not when they want and they wanna be able to go in and do what's been set
A	yeah
B	and come away
A	and then come away
B	they don't wanna set it up
A	and they don't
B	and when
A	wanna mark it
B	no
A	and they don't really no I know I mean
B	so you know
A	I know it's very difficult
B	it's a shame and it's just unfortunate that the boys and
A	yes yeah yeah they will be I'd be interested to see what the school says to you
B	yes oh I will ring I just waiting for
A	mm
B	I said to her last night I want you to do me some notes so I've got actual
A	yeah
B	evidence of
A	mm
B	examples I've got the loomband one you know
A	so tell me about
B	erm
A	cos she was at the
B	no there was talk that she was going to go to
A	where did she go?
B	she went to
A	oh that was right that was right
B	and then she came back from there
A	right cos there was a set there was a set phrase wasn't there?
B	yeah it was she was being
A	she wasn't expelled
B	no she was gonna be sent to
A	what because she was naughty at
B	yeah
A	oh god
B	and then
A	oh so it's not working out so
B	I know
A	bizarre logic is that?
B	to
A	it should be if you're naughty you go to the
B	straight to the
A	instead
B	it's like this is what
A	or
B	with her attitude
A	does she have many lessons with her?
B	er she's in her form
A	oh right yeah but they don't they're not learning in the form are they?
B	no no
A	I mean it's
B	no
A	so it's more the lessons isn't it?
B	oh and told a teacher to F off
B	the next day
A	no
B	yeah when we were at
A	oh no
B	she went into school and this teacher that she was saying she's got this sort of personality clash with but I don't think she's on her own I think there are
A	oh yes yes
B	other children
B	erm
A	oh no and what happened then?
B	I don't know she she was sent to the house
A	mm
B	er all morning and I think she had two lessons in the afternoon but I don't know what's happened I
A	well they'll ring you if you're in the house I should know
B	well yeah yeah you get a ring yeah cos
B	yeah cos
A	if your child's in the house
B	erm
A	yes she's right tell
B	so that's just
A	I've been on the end of that
B	the very next day
A	oh no
B	after she refused to go to school but
B	she did say on the bus oh I'm a bit worried about going home
A	what on the way home? oh did she?
B	uhu
A	I wonder what
B	but you know that time when she hit when she scratched
A	no
B	oh god yeah
A	right
B	but she just pushed her or something and in defence
A	oh god
B	so erm
A	why?
B	exactly and she actually turned round and said to
B	they're being so nice to me since I did that I think they're scared of me
A	oh my goodness
B	and I said to
A	did they not? were there no?
B	she does she's thinking she's got power above and beyond her parents
A	so but is this while she's been in year ten?
B	yeah
A	is she fifteen yet? she's still fourteen
B	I'm not sure how old she is
A	fourteen to be oh my goodness
B	yeah she
A	that's terrible
B	yeah cos
A	thought she was
B	she was gonna hit her so
A	oh
B	but she cut her on her nose
A	oh my goodness I dunno she's er turning into a devil child isn't she?
B	but at primary school
A	mm
B	and
A	to me yeah he's only in year
B	there's another
A	five
A	yeah
B	whatever he should have been on top of that but oh no all the way through primary school
A	oh well yeah I know that
B	mm
A	I know that he's been a bit of a handful hasn't he?
B	yeah
A	but oh my goodness
B	I know
A	the two of them that's awful
B	I mean
A	mm
B	you can still go why should you not go on account of
A	right
B	so I text
A	must have been in
B	I can't
B	I can't ring you back no signal
A	signal yeah
B	erm why don't you come along tonight even if it's just for one hour? in fact it sounds like it's exactly what you need
A	yeah
B	and obviously
A	she did go
B	she did
A	yes yeah
B	because why should she?
A	but that was a but she snuck out didn't she when she didn't know?
B	I I said to
A	there is the problem
B	why?
A	that child's got all the power in the house why would you feel like a naughty school child? that girl's been naughty bang out of order so she should be punished she should be
B	yeah
A	you know mum can go out
B	should still be able to go and why do it
A	on the
B	discreetly?
A	and then if when she'd found out presumably she probably went
B	well I cos that's what I said on the phone I said I I don't want to interfere
A	yeah yeah
B	don't you come?
B	because
A	oh
B	under the circumstances
B	me my myself with a a daughter with attitude like that if
A	no no
B	have come because
A	cos you don't
B	it could kick off
A	you don't know what's gonna happen do you?
B	you dunno what's gonna happen
A	no
B	but if
A	mm
B	I'd have left her to
A	absolutely
B	absolutely
A	dear me oh gosh
B	and I'd have I'd have stomped round that house singing and getting myself ready
A	yeah
B	and made made
A	let everyone know I'm going out
B	an extra thing of it yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm going now
A	yeah
B	absolutely
B	I'll see you later
B	oh
A	oh my goodness
B	and really sort of you know made them feel it
A	mm oh that's terrible that really
B	so only the following day she's telling the teacher to do that
A	and we're only a day later I wonder what's what what'll be next then? I wonder how long she'll be in the house they don't really take
B	she's in there all morning
A	kindly oh just just the morning?
B	well I don't know on that particular day
A	mm
B	do do they tend to return to it then?
A	er depending on the severity of the
B	oh
A	I believe they can have however many days up to a week
B	oh
A	what in sixth form?
B	yeah
A	er yes have they got a name those?
B	it has yeah

A	oh are you? I've just dumped a whole pint in each of those
B	well you erm I don't
B	yeah they said house plants they were specifically talking about
A	which ones on the?
B	but then it did go on to say about house plants a cube ice cube of water per week
A	oh really?
B	but I would give more than that
A	I've this just given loads
B	has this one been done? I don't know if I watered that one
A	yes I think so how which er is it just this left?
B	yes
A	it's a full time job
B	it is a full time job
A	I don't I can't be bothered with it
B	does he pay you?
A	no he doesn't
B	oh that's why you forget
A	he just moans if I forget to water them
A	I I'm so glad you asked how the conservatory was going
A	cos I'd forgotten about that
A	I'll be in trouble later
B	oh I'll text him
A	I don't know where he's gonna put them have we
B	well
A	have we had er have we had our last frost?
B	oh well we don't know do you?
A	cos there's
A	yes yes we have
B	I think it's been growing all year this time
A	it has
B	well it'll only be for the day won't it? will it just be for the day?
A	do you know what
B	you don't want
A	I'm not I don't want them back in no I don't
B	yeah but it's dark in the shed and they need light
A	well maybe you could just put them outside and
B	it might be alright by then it's a
A	it might yeah
B	it's another week isn't it? have we done them all now?
A	er thank you
B	did you do these over here?
A	oh no I didn't no
B	you'd better just do them two

B	we were watching
A	oh Alan? yes
B	last night
A	mm
B	and er he was he'd done a garden for a ninety-year-old lady
A	ah
B	and erm he was talking about this irrigation system
A	yeah
B	and then
A	oh yes we've got one of them
B	and I was saying how he was telling me how he used to

B	I said that's why he likes his gardening cos he spent a lot of time with her
A	I'll shut that door cos it's cold
B	I'll shut it yeah
A	oh thanks
B	it is cold in there
A	it's freezing in there you have to it's it's because of the conservatory so no that's fine
B	is it?
A	like I'd open the double doors to the lounge to make it warm
B	right and it just goes through?
A	you know I need
B	yeah
A	then you've sort of got the whole house but I wouldn't just try and heat it as it is on its own I open these doors and
B	yeah
A	cos this room
B	it's surprising it cos the draught don't come through
A	no it doesn't
B	does it? it's not
A	it doesn't
B	cool in here at all because of that
A	no
B	and it there's a quite a difference
A	there's a massive difference yeah
B	yeah
A	there is but I mean obviously I haven't got that conservatory radiator on the dining room radiator's on cos it's one of those old ones that doesn't turn off
B	oh yeah
A	you know we never we need to replace that one
B	yeah yeah you can't turn them off yeah
A	but it's still
B	oh

B	no I would but I can't actually I can't
A	er I've only got oh I don't think I've got anything plain I bought
B	it's really hard you know
A	I bet it is
B	when you're looking and
A	oh
B	gardens
A	yes yeah
B	and she she's given up sugar she was telling us

B	oh lovely
A	and they've always said you'd be welcome and we've always said would be lovely but the kids only get two weeks off at Christmas it would mean coming for Christmas and it's never something we've wanted to do but obviously they're bigger now aren't they?
B	yeah yeah they are
A	I mean they're old and Christmas isn't
B	yeah
A	like it was
B	it's all over in an hour

B	mm
A	cos the boys would like to ski and they said well no it's not because it's quite a flat loop it's not hard work not as hard as it sounds definitely they said or you could go to
B	it's snowshoeing I would say
A	where you walk on the with the like those bit like tennis racquet type of things on
B	oh yeah?
A	your feet anyway there's they said oh there's so much to do in the winter and we went to a couple of places many years ago Emerald Lake and Lake Louise they were just beautiful and even then they said oh you must see this in the winter I said I'd really like to go there so basically we've booked flights that's all we've done so far
B	oh wow

B	oh
A	the thirty-first cos we've said to the boys how do you feel about going away for Christmas?

B	mm
A	so they'll happily on Christmas Eve you know be picked up and taken and and
B	mm
A	say hello to the family but no that's
B	mm
A	that's their choice
B	oh how lovely
A	isn't that radical?

B	oh yeah I remember you saying that
A	a a month for five years I said and he won't even notice that and by five years' time I'll have three three grand how nice a weekend will that? well where are we? we're up to nineteen years so I've got two thousand four hundred pounds which I've just spent on four flights to Canada
B	oh
B	did you did you tell him though what you'd done?
A	no
B	did you tell him you'd been putting away?
A	no I didn't tell him I was doing it and I didn't so you know to him it's not like to him it was just like blimey I didn't now you had that

B	as your
A	cos next year it will be twenty years we'll have been married so yeah so erm
B	just tell him it's an early early
A	an early wedding anniversary gift
B	memorable
A	the
B	mm
A	gotta go to Gatwick which is a bit of a pain but erm I wanted them to be direct there weren't many flights I
B	really?
A	oh yeah I couldn't get anything under four grand to begin with British Airways Air Canada
B	it's all adults now isn't it?
A	it's all adults
B	all adults
A	and it's peak time
B	mm
A	but this is erm the the they're Westjet they're a Canadian they're a Canadian budget airline I think but apparently have a very good reputation in Canada erm and they're not actually starting this Gatwick to Calgary direct route until May
B	oh gosh
A	it's a new one so erm
B	oh how
A	so yeah
B	exciting
A	I know
B	so what will you do? just take a couple of presents to open on the morning type of thing in a suitcase?
A	no we haven't really thought about that but yes
B	yeah just a little
A	we won't be
B	something
A	it won't
B	getting them back isn't it and everything?
A	but anyway
B	yeah
B	no no
B	I know
A	but no I mean I don't know what they want but no we'll just no I mean to be honest with you
B	well yeah yeah
A	because even though we're we're not really paying for accommodation although I think it would be nice to have a a a couple of nights in a hotel of one of these places
B	you might not need to if I was you I'd
A	no we might not need to
B	judge it when you're there
A	yeah
B	if you decide you want to go and have a little mini trip then
A	yeah yeah we might do
B	book something then rather than you know
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	they just lent us one of their cars actually they've got three cos they keep a big truck that they keep just for going to the mountains erm yeah
B	so they're doing alright there then?
A	oh
B	cos it's
A	that I worked with yeah
B	that's right yeah
A	it was
B	cos that's where I was getting confused with
B	er whose
B	that's right
A	yeah
B	but it's
B	really?
A	just because of the prices of he's he made loads of money when in his last job but he was travelling and he was away from home all the time but he made
B	mm
A	loads and loads and loads of money and then he decided that he'd had enough of that but now he's
B	what does
A	she's I don't know whether she makes money from it but she's very very creative and arty and
B	but she did that course didn't she?
A	she did yeah and writing
B	yeah
A	she set up it's called
B	oh
A	it was in the local papers when it got set up and there's just a stream of events going on and they have writers and they'll have lunchtime reading and there's this workshop and there's that evening and there's this and there's that and she said cos erm she said that there's an apartment attached to this loft as well so if we needed to she said we could put the four boys up in the apartment and we can
B	yeah
A	you know whatever there's all these options but I don't know whether she actually makes earns money from it
B	mm
A	because it seems to be like a
B	perhaps people pay like
B	a membership
A	maybe
B	fee or something
A	I don't know I haven't I don't know it's er I don't even know whether it's maybe a charity I don't know whether she makes money but
B	yeah brings in
A	he earns enough but she's
B	yeah
A	she's very very busy with it and she loves it
B	so it's more perhaps a kind of
A	more like a passion really
B	hobby than
A	yes yeah so
B	oh how lovely
A	I know
B	oh
A	oh
B	oh that'll be so nice
A	I am I'm really
B	very excited
A	and got onto it straightaway
B	cos I did wonder I
A	well
B	yeah it's difficult isn't it?
A	we haven't well yeah
B	yeah
A	so now we've got to save for well there'll be a bit of
B	yeah
A	for Canada
B	after your bathroom yeah
A	now I've paid my you know I've funded the flights
A	I know check me out mm
B	aren't you good? goodness me
A	so yeah it's so exciting something to look forward to already
B	yeah
A	nine months from now actually we'll be going
B	do you know I can't believe I cannot believe where time's going
A	I know but it's March
B	can you? this year?
A	no
B	it's scary isn't it?
A	uhu it's flying past
B	flying I was thinking like they go back to school we're in April
A	well after they've gone I mean after Easter they finish don't they a week today? after Easter that that's the last term already of the year
B	yeah
A	that's the lower sixth gone
B	yeah I know
A	I did say to
B	yeah absolutely
B	just get him to do it beforehand
A	no he won't though will he?
B	tell them in advance
A	I said you know
A	you're not allowed to you're not allowed to take you out of school so we can't go anywhere
B	no
A	at Easter for the next few years cos of exams you know Whitsun I said that no I said no I'll happily say and that's why they they're mocks but I don't want him to have to be thinking oh I've gotta take my
B	mm
A	loads of revision a little bit but not loads
B	he wouldn't even
A	there'll be too much to do
B	pick it up
A	no
B	he'll be too busy and with the boys being a similar age
A	oh yeah yeah oh we'll just
B	like
A	yeah
B	he'll have a ball
A	yeah
B	he ain't gonna bother
A	no
B	he shouldn't have to
A	no that's what I thought
B	no
A	anyway he may have quit by then he tells me he's quitting every day still
A	had enough mum gonna quit
A	he said it again this morning oh I'm just gonna quit school mum I'm just not gonna go
A	I'm not gonna go
B	is
A	erm
A	as far as I know
B	do you see much of him?
A	I think so
B	does he come up? he
A	not I don't see masses
B	no
A	of him he's in the
B	mm
A	so quite often he's in the back of a car
B	yeah
A	either way then
B	yeah
A	erm but that's about all I ever chat to him
B	cos they carried on with the
A	they did but I think they're gonna stop after this one
B	and they were doing well weren't they? they
A	no they weren't
B	oh
A	I think
B	yeah er
A	are the only team they beat
B	oh were they?
A	yeah
A	so cos yeah cos
B	ah
A	that was when they were playing it was like well one of us is gonna get a win this season that's the only one and they're not doing well this season are they? I don't think they've won a game
B	no
A	they may have drawn a couple
B	I was quite glad when
A	oh I'd be quite glad it's I think it's too expensive
B	too expensive
A	and it's a pain cos quite often they seem to have these seven thirty matches
B	I know
A	they want picking up at eight o'clock on a Sunday night well
B	I know
A	I don't wanna be
B	we're running around every night of the week aren't we?

B	erm but she said she erm you know how I can be with children and and I'll sort of
A	oh
B	style
A	that doesn't surprise me
B	mm
B	cos she said she
A	ah I bet she's very good at it
B	ah
A	I did I tell you
B	no no has he done it?
A	he did them on Sunday
A	and it went alright went alright so he got twelve pounds a match
B	wow that's good
A	I know
B	that is really good
A	twelve pounds a match so he had
B	and it's only what? an hour?
A	er er yeah it was an hour each one was an hour so
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and I said
B	yeah petrol money
A	so no er he's got another two this Sunday morning he they'd have given him three he could have done the twelve o'clock match as well erm but he had to be away to
B	that's fabulous
A	to play his own match cos he has to you know he has to be at his match at one fifteen so he couldn't fit in three
B	no
A	otherwise they'd have given him three
B	I know it's a nice little earner that
A	that's a really good little earner so but it was under twelves which is only really the season below him
B	mm
A	or two seasons below him sorry erm but that that's the oldest he could do but er that was all they had available er so they said it cos the guy after they'd done the course said if you can get the younger groups to start with because it'll be easier but erm
A	he couldn't
B	excuse me
A	that was all they had available so so he took it but you get more money for the longer matches which is you know twelve pounds so I said to
B	yes
A	would you leave him on his own?
B	yeah
A	he said no I said no he said no said right he said because he said the although
B	mm
A	you know bit of unpleasantness couple of them you know saying things
B	yeah I can imagine yeah
A	to the referee and he says
B	yeah
A	you just don't know what you're gonna get he said I'm not sure I'll let I'll I'll leave him at all he said because they've got no one to turn to have they? there's no
B	no
A	cos
B	yeah
A	and said well no he was just no he just
B	he as the referee yeah
A	he was in charge so there is nobody there I mean he's only fourteen to to turn to
B	well the thing is I
A	and that's why
B	yeah but there's enough people there that
A	oh yeah no no but it's just
B	but it's not a nice experience
A	putting him
B	for him is it?
A	no it's just putting him at the
B	mm
A	in the early days putting him in a situation that could become quite
B	mm
A	and and how would he deal with it? I said to
B	well yeah
A	people started shouting at
A	at the referee and he was your son but erm but no so I said
B	mm
A	he was they were up and out at nine back at quarter past twelve and then we left again at one for
B	yeah
A	back at three I
B	but it's not all year is it?
A	no it's not all year it's not
B	so you will get
A	it's not
B	that break it's not like it's
A	mm
B	all year and
A	yeah
B	it's not necessarily gonna be
A	no
B	every week is it?
A	no it's not no you're right but it's again this Sunday it'll be the same this Sunday
B	what it what perhaps you might have to do is maybe once every six weeks or something just cross the calendar through
A	yeah and not yeah
B	so at least you get a family day
A	yeah yeah
B	the pressure's off of him
A	well we never get a family day because he plays football
B	mm
A	but at least it's not all day I mean I said I'd go and stand there
B	mm
A	there's nothing and I don't even really know the rules and you know they could be justified in what they're saying I don't know
B	yeah you'd be going like
A	I'd be going did you make a bad decision
B	yeah did you
B	come on
B	oh bless him
A	took his
B	that's really good
A	it is yeah
B	really good because that's that's a skill he can use when he's working full time
A	oh absolutely
B	if he needs a bit of extra cash
A	it's the sort of thing
B	families coming along yeah
A	he'd be good at it he'd be really good at it in fact my
B	yeah
B	well yeah
A	next to him and we could have both earnt some money
B	absolutely
A	and I wouldn't have just been stood there for three hours
B	yeah he'll have to erm
A	I said yeah you could actually
B	he could be earning as well
A	he said it would be just my luck he said erm I'd do the course and then we get put in two
B	oh locations yeah
B	yeah
A	I said yes I'm not sure the referee outfit would suit you as well either
B	no
B	oh
A	but er no that was quite funny
B	oh that's fantastic so we've got
B	football and
A	I know
B	anybody would think you were an incredibly sporty person
B	could have been swimmers
A	oh and he says to me all the time
B	oh
A	oh
B	how's he getting on with all that? with his dyslexia and that is he?
A	well he still gets extra time but he doesn't take it
B	doesn't he?
A	no nobody's really mentioned it
B	does he
A	they don't
B	does he struggle on a day to day basis?
A	I think he's a lot better than he was
B	mm
A	he is a lot better than he was to be honest with you though
B	mm
A	because it's it's I think it's still quite poorly written
B	mm
A	but nobody ever like at parents' evening it it's not important to them they don't ever mention it
B	I thing is is the way people communicate now and will in the future it's all
A	well I mean
B	type based
A	er yeah oh it is it's all type based
B	it's
A	this is only the only time they write isn't it at school?
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	and he can't type a word or he he'll type a word and and it and he can usually guess the correct spelling you know and it gives you the options
B	yeah
A	but sometimes he starts typing and it can't guess what he's saying and I'll and you can speak to it and it
B	yeah
A	er er all the time and you just think that's the way
B	yeah
A	but obviously
B	doesn't matter
A	when they're writing their exams it's all still handwritten but no nobody's
A	he doesn't he just doesn't want to
B	mm
A	but he can read
B	yeah
A	he can read
B	as long as he can
A	er
B	cos I mean
A	mm
B	he really struggers struggles to read and write really struggles
A	well it's like
B	yeah
A	he doesn't write anything at all by hand cos has a
B	mm
A	he's got I think he's got voice recognition software he's got all he's got he's got all sorts of help but he doesn't write anything so even you know when we were in Cornwall with them last summer
A	and I said did he want to to write the postcard to granny it'll only be
B	oh go and get
A	no no
B	oh right
A	he'll be on his way home that's what he'll be doing
A	driving
A	oh it's ten to four
B	I know
A	I've gotta get
B	got
A	not till half past
B	well I've gotta go and get
A	at half past?
B	so I can bring
A	oh have you?
B	yeah I've gotta go and get
A	oh
B	and
A	if you don't mind I'll let him know he's meant to be at one of these boosters
B	tell him to come out to the circle
A	I will do but yeah he er
B	gosh
A	cos I did think to myself well you are gonna need to occasionally
B	mm
A	you know fill out the odd form by hand or put an address on something or write your Christmas cards I don't know but
B	it's something they're not necessarily encouraging him
A	no
B	to do do you think? so
A	so I was a bit
B	has the gene come from
A	oh definitely definitely
A	no he's not but apparently I mean his dad was never diagnosed but apparently he was an incredibly poor speller
B	mm
A	and er and always had a dictionary by his side so I think that's
B	mm
A	mm I mean a lot of
B	and uncle
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but then nobody in my family that we're aware of that's
B	no
A	but but definitely in
B	oh
A	so his grandad and his dad
B	dad
A	apparently his his dad
B	mm
A	it hasn't held
B	well erm

A	oh I know lots of people are yeah
B	yeah
A	no it doesn't need to erm
B	no
A	it won't hold
B	no
A	he'll get ways around it that boy
B	mm that's what the brain does though isn't it? that's what the brain does
A	yeah yeah

A	he doesn't know either I don't know
B	mm it's hard isn't it?
A	mm
B	I mean ideally he could do with going into the sporting world couldn't he?
A	he could really
B	you know
A	he could
B	like coach and
A	would he like?
B	personal trainer type
A	yeah sometimes he says he would like to be a full time tennis coach

B	yeah
A	and that's what they were left with
B	yeah yeah eliminate what you don't want to take
A	and it was a

A	a week today
B	oh I suppose yes
A	so
D	erm
B	yeah
D	yeah
D	yeah
B	and
D	yeah
B	yeah cos she was supposed to be doing netball but she's text me to say it's not on
D	cos they were screaming from the back of the bus
A	who was?
D	no no
A	was he?
D	with
A	oh
B	did you tell them to be quiet?
D	no
A	was
D	er he sat next to this
D	no your
B	oh
D	no
B	oh no
A	he's still at primary isn't he?
D	no he's not he's at year seven
B	oh he is year seven
D	yeah
B	oh
A	oh oh
B	oh er yeah and the other one is
A	oh okay so is
B	yeah yeah yeah they've only done two meets
A	mm
B	there's an awful lot of input at the moment cos you've gotta set these
A	it's all new isn't it yes yeah
B	different things up and all the rest of it and cos it's district led
A	right
B	so like a an email came out yesterday saying that erm in a couple of Saturdays' time there's some erm sailing opportunities and kayak opportunities for six pound for like an hour and a half
A	oh wow
B	down at
A	yes
B	so
A	right
B	because there will be certain people
A	the other adults
B	from
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah erm so there there's there's things that happen in addition to what he organises and all the rest of it erm so there's lots of opportunity for them
A	okay and has he got his helper? I've forgotten I've forgotten who he wanted but
B	yeah he's got erm he did ask
A	no
B	as well he's
A	okay
B	he was helping
A	right
B	and
A	oh yes? yeah
B	had put forward that he was interested
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	and then
A	oh okay
B	an assistant and helper as well
A	oh that's good oh I'm sure it'll be very successful
B	yeah yeah very
A	I mean it'll be nice for
B	himself as he wants to
A	yes yeah
B	I mean on the first night that they all met they were all given wallets with all the forms in that need to be signed
A	mm
B	for different things and you know just all the forms that need to be filled
A	yeah
B	so it it's all he can do it the way he wants it and
A	yes it'll all be organised and
B	yeah yeah so
A	good oh good
B	but there's been er but as I say the I mean the hours he's put in already
A	I bet mm
B	but I said but that's short term because once all this OSM I think it's called is set up and all these different things and the input and the information's inputted on different things then it'll it'll run
A	mm mm
B	yeah yeah
A	excellent
B	so they meet on Monday it's half seven till half nine
A	okay
B	every other Monday at the moment but he thinks by the end of the year the kids are gonna want it every Monday
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	ah oh well that's really good though
B	which he said he'd I don't mind he said once this initial setup is done
A	mm mm
B	he said but to switch it to every money now it would be too much because at the moment he's running it on the Monday and then the following Monday he's sitting and
A	planning and yes yeah
B	not so much planning at the moment but still cos he's had to go to meetings and
A	mm mm
B	different things you know so erm
A	oh good
B	yeah
A	good good
B	so I think er yeah
A	excellent oh
B	and then I think there's two coming up in September and then there might be some
B	he's too old really
A	is he? mm
B	yeah cos it's up to eighteens and
A	oh there's no point he'll be eighteen before you know it
B	listen I'll go now
A	oh okay
B	erm I'm just thinking you
A	oh okay
B	the time five past
A	okay
B	cos we need to
A	oh yes right let me stop that then
