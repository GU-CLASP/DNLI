A	you were part of the Roman Catholic Church up until Henry the eighth
A	erm you know and some of the
unknown_female	yeah
A	it was horrendous absolutely horrendous
B	but all through all through life ever since Christianity began there has been wars and killings in the name of god
A	but but there always have been
B	and there always will be
A	but not just Christian
B	I mean you know it in Northern Ireland
A	well no you have to be er
unknown_female	yeah
A	it is sectarian but the easy way to define them is by religion because the Irish are Catholics and er those that were
B	Protestants yeah
A	hence the the labelling it's the easiest way to to to label people
B	yeah
A	yeah er so
B	but how many er why why do we label people?
A	well because it's an easy way to categorise people you can tell which church they go to
B	and then you you you have a conflict
A	yeah yeah but there there have always been conflicts I mean I
unknown_female	mm
A	erm but statistics show that roughly twenty percent of the world has always been at war it's never changed
B	always
A	never got it's varied slightly but you know
B	somewhere in in the Bible it says there'll be a war every twenty-five years but there's been a war non-stop somewhere in the world
A	well we're one of the worst countries
B	we are we always have been
A	we're almost permanently at war
B	yeah
A	we like to have our finger in the pie somewhere
B	and we're still at war
unknown_female	we are
A	in we are in we're in Afghanistan aren't we?
B	yeah and not only Afghanistan Rwanda we're we're in we're in
A	not in
B	well we come out
A	I mean at the moment we're in Afghanistan
B	in Afghanistan yeah but we've been all over Africa like the Dutch
A	oh yeah yeah
A	and the French and the Germans
B	and the French and the Germans and
A	we're just the Europeans who were the settlers weren't they?
B	yeah
A	you know they they they were the ones taking over
B	now is it true that there are er only two families? one from Africa and one from Europe this is this is a a
A	well
E	no
A	but er I
B	yeah
A	not the Christian story just
B	no
A	you know the first man and woman
B	yeah
A	they were African
B	they had to be
A	right and er
B	mm
A	if you were white you could survive in colder climates because if you're black you radiate heat more
B	it's true yeah
A	if you're white you don't radiate as much heat you're able to survive in colder climates that's why the black people are near the equator right? and er er it seems to indicate the genetic er theories that they've got that black was the original
B	the original colour
A	colour yeah
B	yeah yeah
unknown_female	not white
C	how do you say
B	it does yeah
A	it does both
C	so so it's more uncomfortable to be that colour in the heat
A	it
C	mm
A	if you're black and you're sat in the shade
C	mm
A	you cool better than a white person
C	oh okay yes I see
unknown_female	yeah
A	cos you radiate heat more
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	right? but if you're in a cold environment
C	yeah
A	you're radiating more body heat than a white person is
C	mm
A	so white people are
unknown_female	mm
B	yeah
A	hence as as people got pushed out from the more populated areas or this is my area for my tribe you mate get out this is my space
unknown_female	yeah
A	territorial erm the ones that got pushed into the cold areas the ones that survived the were the ones with the paler skin
B	this er
A	so you get the genetic modification
B	I I I I think Chinese totally different race and the er
A	well they say not you see they say
B	then the Inuit's went up into
A	well the Inuit's look very Chinese
B	they are Chinese aren't they? yes and and this is the Inuit's came from China
C	that's before the Straits were broken
A	look
B	yeah
A	look at the variations of dogs we've got from north
B	we'll that's true yeah but that's only because we interbreed em ain't it that's that's er
A	yeah
B	human intervention
A	yes but this this is as people move the the group that went over towards China
B	that's true yeah
A	had the genetic makeup
B	yeah
A	that meant that they they developed in one way so
B	that's right yeah
A	and they believed that this is because the other lump of the crust was torn off and formed the moon when the earth was in early development you see it got ripped off
B	that's right yeah
A	so you had a big chunk of crust and the rest was water and over time it's tried to balance itself up
B	yeah
A	so it's moved apart and so bits that moved there when it separated they then began to genetically develop independently
E	mm
A	and so you know traits that they have so that's why I mean we
B	well that's true yeah or you weren't
A	because the genetic material
B	unless you lived in Norfolk
A	unless you live in Norfolk of course yeah
A	erm but you get that's why
E	there was no no real no law at the best time
B	no
A	well they argue this is why they have certain genetic problems down in Cornwall because
E	yeah
A	they've a small isolated populations and there was inbreeding
B	if there is no transport as we know it today
A	mm
B	what are you going to do in a village?
B	I mean a village becomes a village when there's so many people but there's so many people interbreeding with their other with cousins
A	yeah mm mm mm
E	mm
B	aunts and uncles they didn't know
A	and if you get too much of it then you get certain traits you might get good traits you might get bad traits
B	your bad traits yeah
A	you tend to notice the bad ones more don't you?
B	you do yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah but er erm the Chinese er the black hair for instance and it's not just Chinese it's Japanese as well
B	it's Japanese as well yeah
A	dominant gene
B	yeah
A	so er if you marry a Chinese person or a Japanese person your children will have black hair
B	mm
A	predominant
unknown_female	yeah
A	the likelihood of
B	yeah
B	so where did red hair come from?
unknown_female	mm?
E	where where did any of the families come from?
B	yeah well
A	where does what?
B	red hair come from
A	it a
B	it's a genetic
A	yeah yeah
B	but they call them Irish don't they?
A	well the probably the group of people that moved into the British
B	yeah
A	because the er north west Scotland and north west Ireland the furthest extremes of the British Isles
A	are where you've got the redheads
B	yeah but
A	that's where the vast majority of redhead people are
unknown_female	mm
B	but I thought
A	and then the you've got the druids haven't you?
unknown_female	you have yeah
A	with black hair then you've got the Saxons
unknown_female	yeah
A	right? and then you've got the Romans which are very
B	they were yeah but Scotland weren't anything to do with England or the British Isles at one time Scotland was out here Britain was here and Scotland just joined it you have you have the actual
C	it's where Loch Ness is
A	I thought that split is where it's moving away not
A	no that's where it joined
E	yeah I thought it was I thought it was moving
B	that's where we joined I'm sure it sure it's where we joined
E	yeah
A	not that I was aware of I thought it was
C	I thought it was moving away cos it's too precise
A	it's a rift valley
B	yeah it's a rift valley
C	that's
A	but a rift valley is pulling rifting pulling apart
B	but it's not moving away now
unknown_female	mm
A	it probably is
A	it probably is moving away
E	yeah
C	as it is it's just gently moving away so it's it's precisely it's almost the same equidistant apart all the way through isn't it?
A	I mean certainly
C	not a lot of difference there
A	yeah the Irish Sea was erm was marshland
B	yeah
A	and you could move between the two
B	well we once moved between well we were part of Europe
C	mm
A	well Scandinavia probably
B	yes
A	well when well we Scandinavians view themselves as not European don't they?
B	they do they do
A	interestingly enough
B	and so the
B	and Ireland not Ireland
A	Norway Sweden and Iceland see themselves as er and Greenland
B	and Greenland yeah
A	see themselves as a cos
unknown_female	yeah
A	a lot of them moved out Greenland is in actual fact very close to Iceland and
B	yes it is yeah
A	and Norway
unknown_female	mm
A	if you go across that way we see it as being a huge distance don't we?
E	mm
B	we do yeah
A	but for them actually it's
unknown_female	it's just
A	you're going up near the top and it's just a
B	just across the road
A	stone throw over yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	yeah it's not far at all
B	it's very strange
E	no
B	and and we're still moving the continents are still moving and moving apart or moving towards each other
A	we're moving apart I think is it? er
C	we're moving apart
A	is it two and a half centimetres a year or something?
B	something like that yeah
A	the Atlantic is getting wider
C	and there's some bits down near erm I think it's just off the north west coast of Africa if er if that bit there's bits perched down below sea level if it breaks off the tidal wave will go right across the Atlantic
A	oh okay okay
C	and it will swamp the whole of erm New York and way inland as well
B	yeah you have a fault right
unknown_female	mm
B	in the middle of of the Atlantic
unknown_female	mm
B	but there is a fault in the middle of the Atlantic and it they said if that fault
unknown_female	mm
B	actually split
C	mm
B	there would be one huge tsunami
C	yeah
B	across Britain and New York
unknown_female	mm
B	and it would flood Britain
B	we would we would not er
C	probably yeah yeah
B	we would not exist any more
A	mm
B	but if if as you say we are moving away and the Atlantic is getting
A	I'd better start building my boat hadn't I?
B	and er
E	yeah
B	bigger that means Russia and all that have
B	gone round the other side to
A	they're all moving moving in different ways though aren't they?
B	well if if the Atlantic is getting bigger there's the Atlantic there and there's the
A	America's moving away from us at the moment
B	yeah which way?
A	away
B	so
A	but but the cos it if you think about it
B	and we're moving that way we're going to
A	yeah but you've got the whole Pacific ocean to
B	yeah it will take it'll take millions of years yeah but
A	I mean yeah by which time our sun's probably be burnt out
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and anyway it's not a crash like that is it?
B	no
A	it's it it it it
B	but this is how the Himalayas became about
A	oh yeah yeah er the Alps are still going up aren't they you see?
B	yeah
A	so that bit is pushing
B	yeah
A	and they're still rising the er erm er yeah the er the
B	but also eroding
A	I'm not sure er no I think they're getting taller at the moment
B	yeah but they're also they might be getting taller but they are
A	there there there will be yes the ice action but no they won't be they won't be much because they're permanently frozen it's only when you get freezing and thawing
B	yeah
A	that you get the erosion isn't it?
B	and with with er the world's
A	and it's it's permafrost so
B	and with the world heating up
A	well
B	we have we have melt
unknown_female	mm
B	we have a melt
A	well people have still got an argument about this haven't they? the the
B	er yeah yeah
A	still arguing that we we have fluctuations of ice ages and heat waves
unknown_female	mm mm
B	and every every every eleven years there's apparently
A	well and much bigger cycles as well
B	yeah
A	yeah cos we had a mini ice age didn't we?
unknown_female	we had a mini ice age
A	in the fifteen hundreds was it?
unknown_female	yeah
A	oh when did the Thames freeze over?
B	in the Victorian times
A	fifteen hundreds
B	the Victorians actually skated on the on the
A	oh
B	on the river
A	but no earlier I thought they had you know they had
C	they had bonfires on it and fairs
A	boar and boar fire you know boar roasts and so on on the ice
C	yeah oh yeah yeah
B	quite weird ain't it?
C	so it regularly used to freeze
E	yeah
C	was daft wasn't it? we had our bikes on it
B	well when I was a kid
C	what year was that sixty-
B	sixty-three was the worst
A	I wasn't there then I didn't
C	completely froze over so solid you could walk on it and took our bikes on it
B	it was the worst winter ever in
unknown_female	mm
B	two foot frost
C	mm
B	how deep the
C	they're supposed to be that deep
B	they're supposed to be
C	they probably aren't
B	and what were they made out that of then?
A	lead
B	lead
unknown_female	lead
A	yeah
B	and there was no end of problems
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	I remember we had a we had a neighbour across the road and he was a plumber I mean a real plumber not one of these pipe-fitters
E	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	a plumber that wiped
unknown_female	mm
B	lead pipes
C	yeah
A	where does the name plumber come from?
B	lead
A	yeah the the plumbo is Latin for lead
B	the plumbo is yeah I know mm
B	and a plumbob is a
C	father had his own way of fixing lead pipes and that was to open up the hole with a drill put in a matchstick tap it over the top
A	that's right I've done that
unknown_female	yeah yeah
C	and then he and then he used to erm he used to wrap up
B	mm
A	yeah and and the cloth and paint was a load of rubbish
C	and it was cloth and paint and it was erm
C	erm what do you use round the windows? mixed with
A	putty
C	with putty
unknown_female	mm
C	and and just wrap a big bandage with
unknown_female	yeah
C	every time he wound it round he put more of this jollop on
B	mm
C	right? so he ends up with a sort of a bandage
B	that's right a big bandage I remember all
unknown_female	mm
A	but all you had to do was the the
unknown_female	yeah
C	yeah
A	and then you just dress the lead over the top
B	and then you wipe it over yeah
A	yeah
B	you woke
C	yeah
B	very clever
A	you used a moleskin didn't you? to wipe it over
B	moleskin yep
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	dad used to keep moleskins
unknown_female	mm
B	kill the moles and keep the skins
A	mm
B	cos that was the best and a
C	spit and polish oh yes I can do that
B	bone spit and polish
C	bone? you
B	yeah but he used to
A	but you used to spoon it didn't you?
C	we spooned it
A	spoon we used to spoon
B	yeah but he used to call it bone spit and polish
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	ah
B	I mean that was
A	so he probably used a bone instead of a spoon
B	probably yeah mm
A	as the hard
B	yeah
A	cos a spoon was good because you yeah you could heat it up and you could take the the bumps off the leather
C	yeah mm
A	but also
B	yeah yeah
A	to shape it and then you spat on it
unknown_female	yeah
A	so it didn't stick on the spoon
B	yeah
A	yeah we used to spend hours doing that in
B	my dad his his
A	and then you go on parade and some nasty toerag would come along and scuff across the tops
A	just as you were about to go on parade
B	you could see your face in my dad's boots
A	not after they'd scuffed em
B	not after they scuffed em no but they used to be
A	mind you I used to scuff other people's as well so
B	that was a job that we had to do
A	we thought it was funny
B	every week
B	every week we had to polish either the the silver or the boots
A	oh we did we did we did we polished at home
E	yeah we did
A	we used to do the brass stair rods
E	oh gosh yeah
A	yeah? and the and the
A	and the
unknown_female	mm
A	fire surround thing
unknown_female	mm
A	what do you call it? the not grate erm
B	the fender
A	fender
E	mm
A	it was mainly the fender and there was a brass erm tray we had in the hall
B	yeah
E	that's right
C	yeah
E	and the money plate
B	amazing the stuff
B	I dunno
E	lovely plate
unknown_female	yeah mm
B	who's got that now? er nobody
B	I don't know I haven't got it
unknown_female	I haven't got it
C	I haven't
unknown_female	no
A	mm?
A	no no no
E	no no
A	no it was in our house
B	was it? oh right
E	mm
C	oh I remember the no I remember the plate
C	there was also a
E	mm
B	I think the table was
C	oh no there was a lovely brass plate
B	yeah but lots of people went round after
E	yeah they did
C	mm
unknown_female	mm
E	mm that was awful that was
B	so-called Christians again helping them out
A	did they?
B	yeah
C	who were
E	those people that befriended them yeah
B	people that befriended your mum and dad
E	not swapping things
B	yeah
C	oh she lost her
E	oh yeah yeah
C	all of it
B	what about you
C	that that disappeared
B	didn't you?
C	and it was replaced by another one
E	was it?
A	oh was it? oh
B	didn't you didn't you
unknown_female	mm
E	mm
B	catch them running up the road?
A	that was
B	that was
C	yeah I caught em
E	mm
A	that was antique dealers
B	yeah
E	yeah
A	supposedly
B	but they had a lot of knockers going on the door
E	mm
B	they even pinched the knocking the the door
C	that was no that was after they'd died
E	that was afterwards
unknown_female	yeah
B	was it?
E	mm mm
unknown_female	mm
A	yeah before the house before I got the probate
E	mm
B	mm
A	somebody broke in the back and so that the could take the letterbox and the
E	mm
A	and the knocker
unknown_female	bronze wasn't it?
A	mm?
C	that was bronze not brass
A	it was bronze yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	yeah
E	mm
B	amazing though ain't it?
C	and the nameplate
A	no the nameplate didn't go
C	nameplate stayed well it matched it all didn't it?
A	well you couldn't unscrew that
C	couldn't no
A	no no mm
B	it's amazing what people'll do though ain't it?
unknown_female	mm
B	when they see an empty house
A	I think well probably the knocker and the letterbox were the builders next door because they were doing some building work next door
C	on the
A	yeah well it was called
C	oh was it? I didn't know
A	yeah
E	mm
C	I know
A	and it became
A	Mencap
E	mm
A	yeah
B	what is it now? have you ever seen
A	I don't really go down there very often now no
unknown_female	no
B	no
A	no
E	mm
B	but it wouldn't be like we know it would it? you had cos er
E	no
B	that was only the only one I think
C	you'd recognise the house still
A	yeah
B	yeah that had a garage
A	mm
B	and a driveway
A	mm
E	I should imagine that's
A	no
C	yeah no that's
A	no probably twenty thirty years later
C	no they moved pretty quickly after that
A	no the
E	yeah
A	the
C	oh right well I got that wrong then
E	well they were a long time
A	and grandad sold them the land
E	mm
C	mm
A	cos he had the strip of land between eighty-five and them
C	yes
A	and he sold them only the front bit
unknown_female	mm
A	because the fence zigzagged further back
C	yeah yeah
A	right? and he sold it to them on the
C	and so he yeah
E	mm
A	so he could have a garage on it
A	you know which was fine I mean yes he he'd've been better off not to have sold it but he'd retired when he was forty-five or something or forty-eight
E	yeah
unknown_female	mm
E	he did yeah
A	and a little bit of money from the sale was probably very
E	can't imagine
C	was this what was grandad's name?
A	that's why I'm called
B	and where's
E	that's
B	his mother
C	mm
B	yeah
E	mm
C	was
A	mm?
E	no
B	she was a big lady
A	no
B	well we got
E	mm
A	ah there's er an earlier
B	I think we've got several that cos er
E	our
A	but she was
unknown_female	mm
E	mm but she was quite
A	oh yes yeah she
A	she had injections every day
E	oh was she diabetic?
A	yep
unknown_female	mm
A	I used to hold her hand while grandad gave her the injection
E	so there is diabetes in our family
A	mm?
E	I didn't
A	I used to hold her hand while grandad
E	yeah
A	gave her the injection each day
E	yeah
A	of insulin
B	don't frighten
A	but no no the
A	you know he sold he sold that land to them probably er they built the garage when I was a tiny little kid
unknown_female	mm
A	and they moved er so probably fifteen years
C	oh right
A	or so
E	mm
A	no no no no no not at all
E	they were nice people the
A	oh the
E	mm
A	yeah
unknown_female	mm
A	yeah they were very supportive they used to
E	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	when mum was in hospital they used to make dad a meal they had a rota
E	mm
A	they did it one day a week and the
E	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	and when they cooked their evening meal
A	they put a dish and brought it over for dad
E	that was a really nice community there
A	yeah
B	yeah
unknown_female	mm
A	yeah
E	it really it really was
A	he paid he
A	insisted on paying them for the ingredients
C	mm
A	you know
E	did he?
A	yeah yeah yeah
E	mm
A	you know and er that that that was right as well because there was no reason why they should be paying for his food
E	yeah
A	but the er they made sure he got that meal and then the rest of the time he ate cans of Irish stew
A	that was it he used to buy it by the crate from
C	well when we were left with dad
A	the wholesaler
C	that's what we lived off all the time he'd just make Irish stew that went alright through the week didn't it?
A	who?
C	dad did
A	he didn't make it
C	didn't he?
A	he bought it in cans
C	oh I see I thought he
A	bought a case of it no
A	no no
C	cos all we had all we had if mother was away or anything for any reason was Irish stew when dad was cooking
A	no he bought it in cans from HBT
C	I thought he made it
E	no the one thing he was good at doing
C	oh
A	he went and got the yeah
E	plu's the scotch pancakes he made every Wednesday
A	yeah
C	oh yes he was at that
C	scotch drop drop scones the other name for them scotch pancakes
E	yeah that's another name
unknown_female	but yeah
A	I don't think he claimed he could make anything else
C	no
E	no he was good at that
C	hey I think I'd better cos old
E	yeah
A	yeah and you've gotta be up early for church in the morning yeah
E	mm yeah
C	no it's Saturday tomorrow
E	you've both been
A	oh it's Saturday tomorrow ain't it?
E	been working since before nine well seven
A	I started at seven
E	this morning
E	can't even get it right
C	no I was up at half six I start I ha'd started at seven cos
C	took the car round to the garage
E	mm
C	to be first in
A	that doesn't count that's not work
C	yeah no but gotta walk all the way back see that that's another mile
A	ah he's got no idea
A	I have to do those in my non-working hours
E	mm
C	mm
C	and I've gotta take it back there tomorrow morning again do you think they start a bit later on Saturday?
A	I spent two and a half weeks
C	mm?
A	cooking for anything between nine and fifteen people
B	I don't know how you do that
E	mm
B	I really don't
C	what have you been doing?
A	well I've
E	Christmas
A	had between nine and fifteen people in the house for the last two and a half weeks
C	oh have you? oh gosh that's
E	when did they leave then?
A	er er
E	was last Saturday? yeah
A	mm er
E	yeah I forget it's quite erm yeah
unknown_female	mm
E	ah
B	where do they all park?
A	mm?
B	where do they all park?
A	oh
A	I annoyed our neighbour a bit I think you know the one who's got the drive that comes out
B	yeah yeah
C	well if he moved his car he doesn't use and tucked it away you could drive straight
A	well his garage is piled up with stuff you see his double car garage
A	but that that is is er
A	er
B	yeah
A	on my drive and it is it is on a you know it is like that
C	yes
A	so
C	and he's in the corner
A	mm?
C	and he's in the corner
A	he's in the corner unfortunately
C	yeah so if he reversed in he could drive out better
A	so he can't park in my way but we can park outside out house house in his way
C	mm
A	and it is it's awkward
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
E	mm
A	but as he quite rightly accepts we're perfectly entitled to park there but it's downright awkward for me
unknown_female	mm
A	you know
E	yeah
unknown_female	mm
C	they came out when I was parking there once and said er
A	that's right yeah
C	which is fair enough if you can
A	yeah
A	but if he didn't have his swing seat and his
C	yeah
A	bamboo on that side he could move the car over and he wouldn't have the same problem
A	and if he if he didn't have his garage full of junk
A	he if he was parked in the garage he would be reversing out nice and clear you see
C	but if he swapped his spare car
unknown_female	mm
C	he
A	well his wife uses that car but she doesn't use it very often
C	oh I see
A	yeah yeah
unknown_female	oh
C	has er has he still got has he still
A	and he has got it over there because if it's over there it's not blocking the route to their front door
A	well they put a thing through our letterbox about three months ago saying it had been sold
C	yeah
A	but it's still got the for sale sign up
E	mm
A	and nobody's moved in so
C	so you still park there?
E	mm
A	the er er oh he parks there as well sometimes
C	oh
A	yeah but why not you know there's nobody there
C	makes it
unknown_female	yeah
C	seem as if there's somebody there
E	mm
C	you're doing a favour
A	no he's parking there cos he wants to park there
C	no but it does
C	but it's quite clearly empty the house and it's got a great big for sale sign outside that's been there for ages
unknown_female	yeah
E	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	that's something I can't understand about some of these houses that we see on Homes Under the Hammer they've been vandalised
E	yeah
B	and you got you got a next door neighbour there
E	yeah
B	and a next door neighbour there
A	mm
B	and this house in the middle has had everything taken out
E	yeah
B	all the all the wiring
E	radiators
B	all the all the radiators
A	really?
E	yeah all the pipework
B	all the pipework everything has
C	well but how do they know know it's not builders going in and out doing something?
E	yeah
A	well they probably phoned up the police and the police have said oh we won't be able to get anybody there for an hour
E	yeah like they do
unknown_female	yeah
A	you know
C	I've had that problem myself
A	chap er chap in
A	he phoned up the police cos there was

B	yeah yeah yeah
E	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	I er I er reported something that when I used to do my rounds I can't cos I'm higher than in in that big old lorry than any er
A	oh right yeah
B	so I could see lots of stuff going on and er I saw all this
E	mm
B	and then the next morning they came round here didn't they?
E	yeah
B	and they said you were right er someone had burnt a lot of stuff up and
E	yeah
B	and er
E	burnt vehicles out and stuff
B	and and the
B	he said can you
E	if they'd got there straight away might've stopped it happening
unknown_female	mm yeah mm
B	can you tell me anything else about it? I passed the scene
E	yeah
B	and I phoned them up
A	mm
B	and they came round the next morning to tell me I was right
E	and it was difficult to phone up wasn't it?
unknown_female	mm
E	cos no
unknown_female	it was difficult
A	but face it you see
E	no
A	so if the people you're saying you know well why didn't they do anything about it?
A	if they had the same experience as you
B	yeah
A	they'd've phoned a couple of times and thought oh sod it I really can't I can't be I can't be bothered with this
E	yeah

E	yeah
A	but at this time of year you
A	by the time you've done the working day there's there's
B	we had we had it by the time half past three
E	yeah
B	it's it's now turning dark and dingy and nasty
E	it's getting really dull and
A	and cold yeah
B	and you think oh I'll give up and this is what the body clock tells you it's dark
A	that's right yeah
B	time to stop time to rest time to go to bed
B	time to sleep you get up when it's light go to bed
E	I think winter is for hibernating
A	well not completely but partial hibernating yeah
E	well you are supposed to slow slow right down
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
E	mm
B	but since the electricity and lights and gas and stuff like that
E	mm
B	we we actually go against our own bodies
E	we'd've been
B	well we would yeah
E	more than that
B	yeah
E	if it was if it was normal animal type living
A	mm yeah yeah yeah
E	yeah
B	well I mean that was dark at half past four four o'clock today it's dark it's quite awful really winter time ain't it? and people get this erm depression fall upon em because of lack of light
A	oh yeah yeah
E	SAD
A	SAD
E	yeah
B	yeah
E	mm
B	yeah
A	that's where I get my light bulbs from you know for the house
B	do you?
E	yeah
A	yeah well I've
A	thirty watt
B	daylight bulbs
E	mm
A	yes they call them SAD lights
B	oh do they?
A	but they're they're only four pounds something each
B	yeah
E	mm
A	so they're cheaper than the ones you buy in the shop that are only twenty watt
B	yeah
A	and they're equivalent to a hundred and fifty watt bulb you see
B	yeah
A	so you get a decent light in the room
B	well we got them lights
B	if you look at em most of em have gone out but that'll leave enough light for us to see
A	yeah but they're expensive
B	they are expensive yeah
A	yeah
E	mm
B	but we've got
A	and then yeah
B	we got
A	LED lights are even better aren't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	I put some LED spots the spots in the bathroom
B	have you? yeah
E	yeah
A	and when they went I got er some LED ones from China for one sixty-eight each or something
B	yeah
A	they they got shipped from China
B	yeah
A	so they took two and a half weeks or something to come
E	mm
A	but when you switch it on of course they're boomf they're there
B	they're there yeah
A	and they're much brighter
B	yeah
E	mm
A	and they use less wattage
B	yeah
A	than the you know the eco lights
B	yeah
E	don't like them
E	I don't like those at all the ones that
A	they don't you know
A	some are better than others the the the SAD lights actually they power up quite quickly
B	yeah
E	mm
A	but some of the other ones I've got
E	mm it's still dark in the room
A	yeah yeah well
B	I've got one in my bathroom that come on and that's bright
A	mm
B	within about three seconds it goes
E	mm
B	and that's that's one of them er
E	right well the one in the little room it's really dark
A	and they're expensive now aren't they?
B	they are
E	yeah
A	cos I bought a whole load when they were ten P each
B	that's it yeah
A	I've still I've got two boxes of
A	two A4 boxes full of em
B	yeah
A	underneath but they're too low a wattage
E	mm
A	er you know er table lamps and lamp stands
B	yeah
E	mm
A	but
E	I don't mind it for
A	yeah
E	you don't mind a dull light
A	mm
E	but sometimes it's nice
B	I got one in in my shed and it's a daylight bulb
A	whose shed is it now? it's your shed is it? my shed?
A	not yours and
B	no no
A	I I noticed that
E	you're workshopping me
A	my shed
B	no my shed my M Y mine
A	have you reserved your space in there
B	you got no right to be in there at all
E	hang on
E	it was my idea so I think I should claim most of I'm not
E	I
B	no no
E	you're getting it wrong
A	it's warmer in the winter
E	mm
B	the room your your sewing room
A	that's a bit chilly out there now isn't it?
E	I
B	it is a bit chilly
E	it was my idea that's all I said
E	it was my idea
B	first thing in the morning it's brilliant
A	yeah
E	it was my idea for you
B	yes and thank you very much
E	yeah
B	and now it's not anything to do with you
B	you come and fetch me in for tea
E	I do
B	that's good ain't it?
E	yeah
B	that's what a woman is for
A	yeah so you'll be out there till four thirty now
E	and and without without
B	no it wouldn't be there
A	yeah
A	has it moved at all? has it got wet?
B	no
E	no
A	it's okay?
E	it's been brilliant
A	so you kept the rain away?
E	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos that's the one thing that really worried me was the water getting in and it moving
E	yeah
E	well the only thing is the edge isn't it? the very edge
A	mm?
E	where the it's not it's this tile and then nothing just just at the very front
B	yeah just at the front
A	oh we didn't bring it across
E	I think we need to do something
B	we didn't bring it right up to the end so I've gotta put something on
A	a little bit of zinc'll do that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I got
A	you've got a bit of lead or zinc somewhere haven't you?
B	I've got some lead somewhere yeah
A	you've got lead roll
B	I have got lead roll yeah
E	well it's quite a it's quite a gap actually it's about that much
A	yeah the roll's that wide cos if if you cut a piece with the roll
A	at an angle
A	you can put it under the tile and fold it round and all you need to do is
E	mm
A	to bring it on top of the sheet
B	that's right yeah
A	and it'll but but did you get the edging strip?
A	have you got the edging strip yet?
B	I haven't got all the edging strips
A	the drip you need to get that
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
E	we've got the
A	you were gonna put the strip along where it goes in the gutter
B	yeah
E	yeah we've got that
A	you've got that now?
B	we've got that yeah we have yeah
A	have you put it on? yeah?
B	yeah that's on
A	oh right right
A	I was gonna say it'll stop the creatures going up
A	cos the spiders'll
E	yeah we've done that
A	mess it up
B	yeah we have got that
A	yeah
B	I haven't screwed it up on there cos that just clip on
A	you don't need to just push it on
B	but that's got yeah I know it just clips on but sometimes when you get a heavy downpour it pushes off
A	does it? oh well
B	so we've gotta get and
A	but you but
A	oh there are?
B	yeah
E	mm
A	cos UHU would do it
B	yeah that would
E	underneath
A	bit of UHU just to grip
B	yeah
A	that's all it needs
B	yeah
E	mm
A	cos it doesn't need much grip
B	no
A	yeah
B	but that's pretty good I had one or two leaks where
E	we actually put
B	they join they join together er
A	yeah
B	that leaked in the joiner that joined
A	where we screwed it?
B	yeah
E	so we actually put the
B	yeah
E	in the beginning didn't we?
B	yeah
A	did what wrong?
B	anyhow it's on that's
A	oh right
B	it's all been sealed

A	and it's the same distance away are you with me? so
B	yeah
A	cos if you have it on the same arm you get the differential in the amount it moves so you had to have a smaller template
B	that's right yeah
E	mm
A	whereas the ninety-one works quite
B	yeah
B	oh yeah
E	mm
A	size every time
B	oh that's brilliant ain't it?
A	right? and then if you
E	no
