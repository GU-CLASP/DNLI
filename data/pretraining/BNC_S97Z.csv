A	yeah I'm doing it now so I'm getting paid to do erm record the British public basically so
B	oh really?
A	anyone British I can record so you you're British aren't you?
B	I am British indeed yeah
B	erm I have been since I was born
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	fancy that
B	how are you getting paid to do that though?
B	what's what's the deal there?
A	er it's Cambridge University Press they're like collecting a corpus of information so a few years back they made one of like written words so like a hundred or three hundred million written words or something was the corpus
B	mm
A	now they wanna make a a spoken one
B	oh right
A	so they need
B	really?
A	pretty good yeah
B	oh well so I can record as well?
A	yeah of course you could?
B	really?
A	yeah any any British person I mean I don't know about you getting paid you might need to get in contact with them yourself but I'm I've signed a contract I'm like a registered freelancer with them
B	oh really?
A	so yeah so I need you to sign some disclosure
B	how did you how did you find out about that?
A	it was posted on
B	oh really?
A	so I was just on there like having a look around and saw this job advert and went on yeah that would be sweet
B	random
B	really?
A	and get paid for it yeah
B	but you can't presumably just record a load of silence
A	no no no
B	there has to be someone
A	we have to keep talking
B	yeah yeah
A	we can't stop talking any time there's a
B	that should be alright for you though
A	no I know yeah my family are talkers I mean
B	yeah
A	I've already got twenty hours of recording
B	have you really?
A	since the last week I've been back yeah so that's about five hundred quid
B	just between you and
A	no no no about three hours is
B	oh really?
A	and everyone I see you know what I mean? some friends are better to record than others
B	yeah
B	is he really?
A	I kind of have to keep cutting it out
B	is it a bit dodgy then?
A	mm a little bit
B	well is he
A	no he got dishonourably discharged
B	what for? stealing?
A	yeah I won't go into that on the recording probably
B	oh really? fair enough
A	if an any point you wanna say something I all I have to do is press pause and then I can un-pause it again so if we go silent
B	oh right
A	I'll pause it you say what you wanna say
B	oh right okay
A	on the pauses you know what I mean? it's all good
B	I know
A	just try to imagine it's not even there
B	yeah
A	not a bad job though
B	so you just had to buy a Dictaphone and
A	yeah
B	and the recording
A	I haven't got paid yet so this is the first month I'm gonna send them stuff off so we'll see we'll see but
B	that's quite good for every hour isn't it?
A	it's a bloody bargain yeah I mean there's more work I have to like I think it's gonna get increasingly difficult to record people as time goes on
B	mm
A	I'm gonna need to start going to old people's homes or something and like recording random people because
B	yeah
A	obviously they don't just want the same people over and over
B	can't you just stick it in a pub or something?
A	mm
B	a pub would be a great people to have it but you need people's permission don't you that's the only thing
A	yeah yeah I need to get like I need you to sign that before you go and like all that can or I only need to get that from you once and then pretty much every time I see you just you can presume
B	really?
A	pretty much
A	oh you bastard
B	where's your ashtray?
A	here
B	so oh right
A	that'll do won't it?
B	forgive me for er
A	yeah
A	back to the students days yeah we are students anyway
B	you are actually a student aren't you?
A	yeah I know
B	that's a pretty sweet little job you've got there is that gonna be your part time work now then mm?
A	I needed I've got enough
B	yeah
A	a bit of cigarettes or something
B	a bit of pleasures
A	yeah like that kind of stuff but apart from that we wanna go and see people or do anything we need to earn
B	yeah
A	and if I thought if I can do five hours a week that's a hundred quid a week you know what I mean? just like five hours or recording
B	yeah
A	so that's what's I'm hoping is going to carry on
B	well that's really good actually isn't it?
A	well it means that I don't have to do any erm
B	exactly
A	with any proper teaching or anything like that
B	but that only goes until June?
A	until June
B	next June
A	well they told me unless they don't get enough from people and then it'll go on longer than June
B	oh right
A	so they must have to get a lot a lot of hours
B	yeah
A	worth you know what I mean? to say to people unlimited until next June that's a bit crazy
B	mm
A	so yeah we'll be meeting up shit man how's your baby?

B	and she's practically disabled yeah man
A	yeah
B	yeah she's pretty swollen up

B	you can't even imagine it
A	it would freak me out do you remember The Fly?

A	yeah
B	like I think you've got an actual human being
A	a human inside
B	growing inside you what that actual
A	living off you
B	and it's half mine
A	yeah
B	it's half of my genetic material is growing inside you

B	what?
A	yeah
B	and it's gonna be here I mean it could be here any day really
A	yeah right
B	I mean it's
A	well you're on red alert now aren't you?
B	yeah as I was saying before there must be like this instinctual thing whereby you just have this like overwhelming protective feeling
A	I do not
B	yeah
A	no worries mate
B	well I'll stay for a tipple obviously
A	yeah great timing though innit?
B	mm

A	so
A	yeah I know what you mean

A	we're here for a year man so
B	yeah exactly so you know it'll level out by then and you know I'll be getting to go out on nights out and stuff like that do you know I mean?

A	just send me out and I'll go and
B	well er they're called nappies here yeah
A	yeah sorry nappies
B	yeah why d'you do that?
A	I mean
B	is that all the time you spent in Korea?
A	just I'm around American people a lot and Koreans use American English so certain words
B	mm
A	I mean certain words have their place you know what I mean? I say vacation and not holiday because to me now vacation is like a break from work holiday is like Christmas or new year or
B	right
A	do you know what I mean? like
B	that's fully Americanised
A	yeah yeah but they don't say holiday they just say vacation
B	yeah
A	so now I've got somewhere in between
B	but say holiday for Christmas happy holidays and
A	yeah they do
B	and Thanksgiving

B	yeah
A	so when I mean it all I say candy if I say chocolate I'll say chocolate and er if I say sweets I think like hard boiled
B	yeah
A	little candies or something
B	so I work with quite a lot of Geordies

B	huh? we've got a car yeah but I don't I fly up there
A	no yeah

B	no
A	yeah so that's what like forty-five minutes on the flight if you're flying?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	just out down
B	pretty much
A	and you're there
B	yeah er it is a big hairy though
A	all expenses?
B	cos the plane's like tiny oh yeah I'm not expected to pay for it
A	good shit
B	if I had to pay for it
A	fair enough
A	mm
B	and they call it ket
A	ket?
A	never even
B	like as in ketamine

A	yeah it's ket
B	mm
A	you do pick up these things off other people
B	yeah
A	as much as I don't want to I say apartment this is my apartment now and not my flat
B	yeah it's flat
A	flat kind of sounds a bit weird though I mean
B	it's not technically not flat
A	when you think of like a flat no I mean it's really wobbly or whatever
B	yeah it's upstairs it's split level
A	now I think flats as like those high rise really shitty don't wanna live there
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that that's a flat to me whereas this more of an apartment like a building
B	see I would say the opposite
A	yeah
B	I would say an apartment is a high rise
A	a high rise one
B	yeah
A	for
B	or condo
A	are we speaking the same language anymore?
B	I don't
A	I don't know
B	do I even know you anymore?
A	no
B	where's the lighter gone?
A	that think you do
B	yeah very true
A	it goes
B	did you bring back loads of tobacco and stuff?
A	no just one pouch
B	just one pouch?
A	yeah from Malaysia fifteen
B	what what's the currency?
A	ringgit in Malaysia
B	ringgit?
A	guess like three quid
B	oh oh really? for fifty grams?
A	yeah it's pretty good isn't it?
B	why did you only bring that one then?
A	cos I'm trying not to smoke
B	mate that was just
A	it's terrible since I've come back I've been smoking cigarettes but
B	lord logic
A	yeah I know terrible
B	it's gonna cost you more
A	you were talking going down the pub now I went down there's one just over the road
B	yeah
A	on er
B	yeah
A	couldn't
B	mm
A	and we had a drink it's pretty much five quid a pint
B	oh yeah it pretty much is
A	I was in Cambodia a few months ago and it's fifty cents a pint and now I'm like
B	yeah
A	thirty pence for a pint
B	yeah
A	and then I look at that fiver oh right er
B	yeah it's ridiculous
A	I can't really spend my money on it
B	it's hard to justify it and I sort of go to the pub like a lot more er well I used to go quite a bit that's pretty much where I would spend most of my disposal income
A	I definitely want to know some good pubs so we'll definitely erm
B	there's loads now in
A	we'll definitely yeah I mean
B	I mean haven't even
A	it's looking pretty bohemian around here now yeah
B	yeah no it's really cool
A	yeah
B	I mean I haven't even explored one percent of the good pubs in in Brighton
A	yeah
B	I'm a bit of a
A	yeah I walked up there today
B	move out from
A	I went to
B	mm
A	erm there's a post office up there kind of annoying I've got a post office just here have you seen it? on
B	but that's the sorting office
A	but that's the fucking sorting office
B	yeah I know
A	so you post it it doesn't you know
B	mm
A	there's if you look on the front door there's no doesn't say whose flat is what doorbell
B	no
A	so I don't think they can tell
B	is that the
A	so erm I had to stomp up there and they told me that it wouldn't gonna be in till tomorrow
B	really?
A	I swear whenever I got a parcel later they told me two hours later to go up there
B	twenty-four
A	so it's twenty-four yeah I didn't know that
B	does say yeah it does say on the back of the thing
A	has that always been the way or is that just a
B	I dunno it all I mean the post around here is pretty shit anyway
A	yeah
B	cos there's so many flats
A	yeah
B	that they just get a bit confused
A	yeah
B	so that it's shocking
A	I don't blame them I mean there are a lot of people living here
B	yeah
A	it's nice though man from what I've looked around
B	oh it's lovely mate you're gonna have a great time here honestly
A	I've got some friends that are pretty quite jealous that we're like in
B	yeah
A	so you must get that too from your mates
B	yeah yeah
A	it's a nice part of the country
B	I do yeah and they come down and see me and stuff and the good thing is
A	you pay for it though
B	like if you
A	yeah
B	so up by your
A	yeah
B	and that's beautiful up there really really nice and you can go well you can actually you'll probably wanna take a flask of coffee up there if you go there
A	yeah
B	cos it's about like three quid for a coffee
A	oh bloody hell
B	yeah
A	I don't still don't drink hot drinks
A	no no no
B	forgot about that
A	I have a lemon and ginger and honey tea if I'm sick and that's about it
B	yeah and she
A	and she likes it American style like proper stuff
B	she used to be a right tea monster
A	yeah yeah she is she has it all black nowadays though black coffee black tea
B	oh really?
A	it's got no sugar no milk
B	yeah sugar's bad man
B	sugar is so bad for you
A	yeah not too to be you're looking good though man
B	oh cheers man
A	you're looking trim
B	I think I've put on a bit of weight actually
A	getting
B	this and the
A	bit of erm pregnant what's that called when you have like simulated pregnancies you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	like er
B	like empathy was but
A	yeah yeah your girl's getting bigger so you get bigger too
B	yeah well I just like provide her with cos I'm like the primary chef
A	yeah
B	in our house
A	yeah
B	so er and I wouldn't have it any other way really because you know I like to cook
A	yeah
B	for a start and and then secondly if she cooked it would just you know it wouldn't be right
A	mm she could wash up
B	I'd be in there interfering yeah so she does all the washing-up so our division of labour is I do all the cooking and the shopping
A	yeah
B	like food shopping and she'll do all the washing and the washing-up from
A	yeah
B	and then we kind of
A	yeah I do all the money and the you know
B	mm
A	the banking and the emailing random people and that
B	yeah
A	and all that kind of shit
B	but you've done a very good job you know saving as much as you've done in that short time
A	it's all gone though mate
B	you must have lived quite frugally in those two years
A	no we did we did live pretty frugally I've lived frugally since since uni
B	yeah
A	and I'm still I've been a student the whole bloody time
B	and it's not gonna change throughout this year I wouldn't have though
A	we saved fifteen K
B	yeah
A	and six grand
B	between you?
A	no each
B	yeah
A	so fifteen grand each
B	so you were thirty grand?
A	we had thirty grand between us but we put down so I'll just talk about my money cos
B	yeah
A	six grand I wanted to go to Edinburgh but that changed
B	so
A	it to eight grand so she did the same
B	so that's twelve gone
A	so that put me down yeah so six out of my fifteen I got nine
B	mm
A	I've already whacked them about seven grand on the rent that's paid eight months up front
B	yeah
A	and basically
B	yeah
A	which is enough to live on and be comfortable but if I wanna start doing shit
B	yeah which you will
A	like I need I need this money from this job
B	yeah yeah basically
A	so
B	and probably get a part-time job as well
A	yeah but when we go to Saudi after this apparently we can save double what we were saving in Korea in Saudi
B	oh really?
A	so I could I could save about fifteen grand in one year
B	really?
A	er yeah man no joke
B	so what you must have been saving then so what? you've saved fifteen grand in two years so you were saving about five hundred quid a month
A	yeah it was about seven hundred but bearing in mind
B	yeah
A	I've done I've been travelling and done stuff
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	on in that time but I was saving about seven hundred quid a month and apparently in Saudi you could save about fifteen hundred a month
B	so what were you netting then?
A	er not very much I was only
B	yeah
A	I went down I was on when I was at the public school I'd been there for a while so my pay was up at like two point seven million
B	yeah
A	which is about eighteen thousand pounds
B	mm
A	I took a pay cut down to two point two million and I went down to about fourteen thousand pounds
B	right
A	I lost my flights home I lost my renewal allowance
B	why did you take that though? because of the CV?
A	the job was better yeah for my CV
B	mm
A	and I didn't have any office hours so
B	it seems crazy though that the job's better but you're paid less
A	yeah yeah because it's more wanted it's more desired
B	yeah
A	and a lot of the people there do like extra hours like er I did some proofreading so I got extra money for like proofreading people's PhD theses and all that kind of stuff
B	oh right yeah
A	but I didn't rake in much extra
B	no
A	so I reckon one year cost
B	oh really?
A	yeah taking that job so that wasn't like a big pay cut
B	right so so you weren't saving seven hundred a month then?
A	no no I was saving about five hundred and a half
B	four yeah
A	for that last two so more in the first year less in the second year
B	yeah
A	and we're gonna do a year here and then and then try and get to Saudi I guess or somewhere
B	yeah and that's therefore you're getting married
A	yeah that's why
B	pure it's purely an administrative procedure
A	basically yeah basically
A	we have to sign the paper well that's why I proposed you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	cos
B	no
A	you know what I mean? we're gonna get married but there's nothing else there I found her a wooden ring like online
B	yeah
A	and got it engraved with the day we met
B	yeah
A	which is the same day I met you actually
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	on the twenty-fourth of September
B	yeah
A	erm and then I proposed to her in the nicest place I could so
B	yeah
A	at least she got something kind of romantic
B	yeah by a bin
A	yes I know there was a bin there was a bin
A	yeah I know
B	by a bin
A	I couldn't
B	just in case it went wrong
A	couldn't photograph
B	yeah it was yeah it was a beautiful place yeah I loved it mate
A	but if we get married it would just be our
B	and will you do it in England?
A	erm probably in
B	yeah?
A	it will probably just be my mum and my dad
B	this so this year?
A	her mum and her dad
B	oh really and that'll be it?
A	and it would be yeah in in in April or May next year
B	oh I wouldn't mind coming along mate
A	yeah I mean I'll I'll have to see what's going on
B	yeah
A	at the minute we're kind of saying cos the problem is I think well I've only got one full brother so like
B	yeah
A	he can come along but then if we say siblings can come that that means
B	yeah
A	and they have wives
B	yeah
A	and they have children and then it just starts adding up
B	and before you know it
A	loads of fucking people
B	you've got a hundred people coming to your wedding
A	yeah so I mean I guess we could have my parents and her parents and we'll just sign the paper and then afterwards we could have a bit of a party or something with anyone that comes wants to come down to
B	yeah
A	but it's not even definite because if
B	mm
A	then we won't need to get married and therefore we won't so
B	oh really?
A	in our eyes we are married you know
B	well yeah you've made all the same kind of commitments haven't you
A	well yes well we have a joint bank account
B	yeah
A	we've lived together for ten years we've well almost ten years can you believe that?
B	yeah it's amazing
A	almost fucking ten years yeah nine years
B	but did you get a
A	actually I tell you a lie I'm just about to get one
B	yeah
A	I'm just about to get one because
A	yeah I the problem is when we're living
B	it's just easier
A	when we're living abroad
B	erm yeah well I'll go for a a cigarette definitely
A	yeah cool erm
B	erm
A	problem with oh joint back accounts
B	joint banks
A	so basically with the joint bank account while we're living abroad now they owe we another month's pay
B	right
A	they owe me my final I'm actually on vacation at the minute
B	yeah
A	so I'm getting paid
B	oh right
A	so they owe me my August pay I did just receive that yesterday
B	yeah
A	and they owe me we get a bonus month's pay
B	right okay
A	in Korea it's like labour law so you do twelve months
B	oh really?
A	you get a thirteenth month free
B	oh really? so like a bonus?
A	yeah yeah it's just just as their rule
B	yeah
A	it's like their labour law Saudi does it as well so it's pretty useful
A	so erm we erm I need a book or something so
B	joint bank accounts
A	joint bank accounts we owe we get charged about thirty to fifty pound every time I transfer money home
B	yeah
A	every single time and that's a bit annoying so if we had a joint bank account right now they could potentially put mine and
B	right
A	but because we're separate we've gonna get charged both thirty quid for August pay
B	yeah
A	and then both thirty quid for the bonus pay so it's like a hundred a twenty quid in charges
B	yeah man
A	you know what I mean?
B	it's really annoying
A	which we pay we pay like sixty quid a month in charges it's a bit annoying but yeah I mean once you take off rent rent's a massive
B	yeah and well you weren't paying that out there were you?
A	no weren't paying any rent
B	it's a massive expenditure
A	we weren't paying yeah yeah weren't even paying bills in
B	so if you were paying rent you wouldn't have been able to save that money basically?
A	no no no although rent is cheaper there than it is here
B	yeah
A	but you would have still taken out some some more money for sure and like this last job we didn't even pay bills er nothing
B	no
A	no it was all completely comp we lived on the university campus
B	yeah
A	we had fairly good sized like kind of two rooms of this size next door to each other
B	yeah
A	and it was erm
B	I bet it's nice to get nice in the British culture which you've been out for a while
A	yeah yeah definitely it's changed a little bit
B	cos it's a bit of a bit of a crazy culture isn't it in Korea
A	yeah
B	particularly South Korea
A	yeah no we
B	but so westernised at the same time
A	mm
B	but it they're just massive drinkers aren't they?
A	they are really no a proper alcoholic yeah
B	proper alcoholics
A	I need to cut down cos it's been ridiculous
B	proper like salary men
A	yeah
B	know what I mean but if you look at South Korea's economic growth over the last erm ten years
A	yeah
B	it's the most developed
A	yeah no it really is
B	country in Asia like even it dwarfs China in that respect
A	yeah yeah it's crazy how much they've come on in fifty years is insane because
B	mm
A	I mean fifty years ago it was the poorest country in Asia
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	pretty much like Korea and nowadays it's
B	it's now they've got the highest erm one of the highest anyway of gross domestic products
A	yeah
B	in Asia
A	yeah
B	I mean China have got quite a
A	they export a lot
B	they export loads
A	a lot of Samsung
B	yeah
A	a lot of boats Posco steelworks and all this kind of stuff
B	yeah
A	we get actually the amount of foreigners that are living there now is on the up and up there's a lot more people living there
B	yeah
A	erm they do some things right they do like if you go into a in Korea mate
B	yeah
A	you will get a new card if you want one on the spot they will make it for you right there and then
B	really?
A	you just get it it's none of this two weeks in the post bullshit you know
B	yeah yeah yeah and then they'll send it you separately and everything
A	you know you go to a cash machine you can transfer to anyone's bank on the cash machine like that you can pay all your bills on the cash machine
B	really?
A	you can you can put a deposit physical money in the cash machine and like put it into your bank account
B	yeah
A	some of their services are better however some things they do are completely back-to-front
B	really?
A	like just really retarded
A	I mean you heard about these
B	oh yeah yeah
A	three hundred children died
B	yeah
A	they basically did that because the captain told them to stay still so they did so three hundred children didn't move on didn't evacuate a sinking ship so by the time the people got there to evacuate them they were still inside the boat had tipped
B	standing still
A	the boat had tipped over they couldn't get out the had they just thought used a bit of common sense
B	evacuate
A	you know what I mean? and evacuate like anyone in the west would have done
B	mm
A	they wouldn't have all died but they didn't
B	they were trying to
A	they were following orders
B	calm yeah
A	it was part of their have you heard of Confucius?
B	no
A	Confucius is this famous Chinese philosopher
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	and and basically a lot of cultures in Asia are Confucian
B	yeah
A	they believe in the hierarchy they believe like father to son you know mother to daughter teacher to student
B	yeah
A	all these kind of like roles
B	which is why it's sort of a very respectable society
A	yeah yeah absolutely
B	yeah
A	so unfortunately that has its negatives and everyone dying in a fucking ship
B	yeah
A	is one of them yeah it's pretty bad
B	but a positive of that I bet you got no shit when you were teaching in schools I bet they were had your devout attention
A	erm
B	mm
A	erm we're afforded less respect as a foreigner than we are as a normal teacher so like I always made sure that I dressed as smart as I could
B	yeah
A	so like that helped with my respect and all that kind of stuff
B	mm
A	and obviously I was in a public school for three years
B	yeah
A	so it's a public school so there's obviously gonna be some bad
B	did you really?
A	yeah
B	really?
A	because I think I've told you before they all go to like private schools and stuff
B	yeah
A	so basically the students consider that private that public school isn't really worth your time you know you learn the real stuff in private school like after hours public school is just day care we're just looking after the children so they
B	oh what so they all go to private or after the school?
A	it sucks mate the average high school student goes to school at seven o'clock finishes at six o'clock has a one-hour break and then goes to a private school until midnight or one o'clock
B	and then does homework
A	and they go to
B	there's too much that isn't it?
A	it is too much
B	that is too much like there's only so much your brain can absorb
A	no absolutely
B	you know there's a there's a limit
A	and then they come to school and they fall asleep
B	do they actually do that?
A	no yeah did I tell you the time I had my first ever time I invigilated exams was in my high school and we were doing the English exam and I was put with the head of English
B	mm
A	naturally he couldn't speak any English
B	yeah
A	but that's
B	yeah
A	it's a two-hour exam and I'm thinking there's no way he's finished his paper you know what I mean? so I kinda look over at the the head of English and he he looks at the student and I look at the student he gives me a nod and he's kinda I understand he very slowly walks around behind the student
B	mm
A	stands behind the sleeping student looks at me again as if to get acknowledgement is this the right student I give him a nod
B	yeah
A	yeah it is he's he punches the student full force twice in the head
A	just
A	I
B	are you pretending to write?
A	are you pretending to write?
A	I watched that one the other day
B	did you really?
A	my brother has got into Peep Show he never liked it before and I sat down and watched that in nine episodes with him in a row with with a bit of this and it was quite
B	yeah
A	it was quite funny he enjoyed it
A	yeah
B	yeah it is nice beer
A	yeah yeah definitely I'm enjoying it I haven't had a Kronen but you can't get these in Korea
B	can you not?
A	mm
B	I do like a Kronen
A	actually that's a lie
A	more recently they've started stocking them but I mean you're gonna pay like two pound a can for
B	mm
A	for this thing actually produce in Korea can be ridiculous pick up a carrot okay it's a big fucking carrot
B	mm
A	but this can cost like two pound fifty for one carrot
B	no way
A	yeah
B	oh really?
A	bag of the problem is that it's everything's really seasonal
B	yeah
A	I'm finding in England it's fairly fixed like year round but it changes a little bit
B	yeah we you know we import it
A	but yeah but not too much Korea you go for like one kilo of potatoes one month is six pounds
B	yeah
A	six pounds for a kilo of potatoes
B	mm
A	the next month it's like a pound fifty P
B	really?
A	yeah
B	well actually mate our last winter there was four fail harvests the year before
A	yeah
B	cos the summer was the really bad and loads of potatoes got like rotted and stuff in the fields erm so consequently last winter potatoes were almost like five quid a bag they're like four pounds seventy or something
A	oh just
B	but just normal sized
A	the massive potato famine
B	oh my god I thought I actually thought of you I thought if
B	and cheese is relative cheap at the minute and all dairy in fact so I don't know why so you can get a big thing from Tesco's for like a bit what was it? is it two and a half litres or whatever of of milk
A	yeah
B	and it's a quid
A	that's pretty good
B	which is a bargain an absolute bargain
A	yeah it is I was actually quite impressed because of how expensive Korea was
B	yeah
A	when I came back to England and I think I went to Lidl's with my mum or something and like okay the quality of product isn't as good there but it was cheap
B	yeah
A	you could get like a
B	yeah
A	five hundred gram pack of beef mince
B	and actually no
A	for like two pound or something
B	and the quality of product in like Lidl nowadays is actually really good
A	it seems okay
B	my parents shop in Aldi all the time
A	yeah I thought
B	my dad absolutely loves it
A	I think it's just whether
B	no
A	so erm yeah I
B	oh it's a massive mission
A	beyond the train station and then we don't have very good access to supermarkets
B	no I was thinking that
A	we have to go all the way down the hill I thought we did when I stuck it on a map but when you actually walk there's kind of things in the way
A	like the train station which
A	so with the
B	yeah
A	what's the road called? that main
B	er erm
A	is that
B	yeah yeah
A	running across where Waitrose and all
A	Waitrose is a bit pricey so we didn't go there
B	oh no don't
A	but
B	I never go there
A	we went we went down by the train station and down that road that goes down under the train station
B	yeah
A	you know what mean? and then that was kind of like a quite a bohemian looking road that one I don't know what that's called
B	yeah yeah yeah very cool
A	and then we took a turn and there's like a Sainsbury's erm an Aldi
B	mm
A	and another one I can't remember what it's called
B	yeah
A	erm so we went shopping there but yeah it's not that close for
B	yeah so if I was you and lived here and didn't have a car or anything I would probably consider doing my shopping online
A	yeah I considered that what's it like shopping online?
B	I don't know I've never done it
A	no I've never done it
B	I've never done it and the reason why is because I've got Tesco's quite close
A	yeah
B	and I actually if I can I do prefer to go there and pick stuff and look at sell-by dates so
A	get the fresh produce there
B	and you
A	yeah
B	you can put stuff back it's not like you're walking round the supermarket you're not really you haven't got a clue how much you're spending
A	no
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah definitely
B	so it's good
A	is it on the way on on
B	yeah
A	apparently and that's only about a kilometre and a half from here
B	yeah
A	and I don't I haven't cycled it yet but it's on the way to the uni so I'm thinking maybe I can kind of stop off there after I'm hoping to cycle to uni as much as possible if I can
B	yeah and it it's really accessible I mean the only times you won't want to cycle to uni is if it's pissing it down
A	which is er almost every day
B	and then you can just get the bus cos you're on the bus
A	oh right
B	mate before you came back it's been lovely
A	yeah I know I came back
B	the weather's been so good
A	and it's just it's like Autumn's kicked in or something you know
B	yeah yeah it pretty much has
A	whatever actually to tell you honestly I don't mind the weather at the minute it's nice to be a bit cooler and er all the kind of stuff
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	yeah she doesn't want to be like sweating balls or anything
B	no exactly that
A	yeah
B	no it's like er get another beer?
A	you need to be in Brighton of course you can mate
B	do you want one?
A	er I haven't finished that one yet
B	oh right sorry mate I'm still a quick drinker
A	no it's all good I've only got four mate
B	oh have you? oh I
A	I'll grab some more
B	oh cool yeah get some more there's
A	I thought you wouldn't be around too long but you drink you drink fairly quickly so
B	well yeah that's it and you know as much as I try and not get drunk at the minute you know
A	it's not as easy as it sounds
A	no no of course
B	you know I don't mine er it being a bit tipsy or whatever
A	yeah yeah
B	but ideally I'd still like to be able to drive but it's not gonna be the end of the world if we have to get a taxi
A	no no get a taxi
B	as long as I'm compos mentis and the thing I have to ask myself if
A	yeah you have to keep saying that
B	do you know what I mean?
B	no
A	it's gonna be intense you're not going to do a
B	no
A	it's a good one
B	got to be there so we did this erm NCT course which is the National Childbirth Trust and it's an antenatal course
A	oh okay
B	so you get a certain amount of antenatal courses free on the NHS we didn't do those erm we basically paid a hundred and eighty quid for this course
A	yeah
B	which I thought was a right rip-off at the time I thought there's no way I
A	what can they teach you?
B	well what can they teach you that the NHS one isn't gonna do?
A	yeah or I can't pick up on the internet or
B	yeah I really didn't wanna do it
A	not much of a compromise is it?
B	yeah I compromised
A	yeah
B	I compromised my position
A	I bet
B	but anyway we we went to this course and it was two full Saturdays and one evening and do you know what? this course was absolutely brilliant
A	oh
B	it taught me so much yeah I was really ill prepared for and this course it
A	that's good that you recommend it so highly
B	and if you think it about it actually
A	are you sure you're not a salesman?
B	oh yeah no no I
A	no it's pretty good
B	that's a good deal
A	yeah definitely what kind of things did you learn then?
B	mm
A	what kind of wisdom can you pass on cos
B	we
B	well you'll probably be better off coming back here to have kids wouldn't you anyway?
A	yeah that's the problem like it complicates the situation quite a lot I've met children that are from families that move around a lot and the the child though
B	they're pretty fucked up
A	well yeah I mean basically though the child may be on paper more intelligent and you know speaks numerous languages and done these kind of things with regard to social interaction with people in their school or whatever I mean I met a girl that in my in my upper school that was erm a compulsive liar basically
B	yeah
A	cos she'd been travelling so much and she'd been around so much people couldn't call
B	yeah
A	which she hadn't you know what I mean you haven't been around
B	yeah
A	so
B	therefore you won't have kids for a little while
A	we still wanna do a PhD after we
B	do you wanna have kids then?
A	a part of us definitely does like both
B	it's well it's the ultimate one that
A	yeah it's massive
B	could obviously
A	yeah and it's a massive experience and nothing else covers it so we've discussed it and we kind of think maybe if we get to like forty I think
B	wow
A	another ten years of travelling educating
B	well the thing is mate forty's too late for a woman these days
A	yeah
B	I mean it can be done I mean in our
A	my mum had one at forty-seven
B	well yeah and there was a woman in our NCT class who was forty-four
A	mm
B	er but she'd got artificially inseminated
A	yeah yeah
B	so her eggs weren't working so it's someone else's eggs and his sperm
A	and this is the problem again when we've added what up what we need to do and then we decide that forty is the perfect age to do it and then realise
B	biologically it's not
B	yeah yeah
A	so then I guess we've decided that at that point we may just adopt I think
B	yeah
A	erm it would be
B	but that's not the same is it though?
A	you've got a child that's not the same as you
B	it's not the same
A	but if you think about it adoption could be better if you waited and you adopted a child when they were eighteen years old and just about to go to uni and you pay for them to go to uni
B	yeah
A	and then
B	they'd just be like oh cheers mate
A	and then you you you basically have an agreement
B	mug
A	you sign a contract that says I pay for you for uni and for the next ten years and then you pay for me for when I'm like retiring cos we may need help
A	I think that could be a good
B	well for them it's not
A	if you set up single people with students around the country that don't have a
B	it's a crazy idea
B	it'll never get off the ground
A	so I don't think er I don't know if we will have children then cos
B	right
A	we haven't got enough years basically we're actually
A	senescence is really starting to kick in
B	have you planned out your years until you're forty then?
A	well not in so many words
B	no
A	but if I start counting and I go okay well I'm twenty-eight now I wanna graduate twenty-nine but coming on thirty
B	yeah
A	I won't be far I'll be in I'll turn thirty in Saudi Arabia I'll do a year there I definitely wanna travel Africa for a year
B	I mean
A	yeah I know
B	that's so depressing
A	it's coming around you're even closer as well
A	you're even closer
B	it's like yeah eleven years
A	so then I mean Saudi at thirty-one
B	mm
A	I then need to work for a couple of years to pay for a PhD
B	Yeah
A	a PhD is another three or four years
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	and then I'm like already thirty-six thirty-seven
B	yeah
A	then after I get a PhD I need to get a decent fucking job
B	yeah
A	that actually pays alright I've got to be doing research and shit at the time
B	yeah
A	so you're looking at forty before I think I'll be
B	yeah
A	you know life-ready
B	emotionally and everything yeah
A	yeah to actually do it
B	ticked all your boxes essentially
A	yeah basically because if I wanna be a uni professor in England
B	yeah yeah there's a few
A	you have to have a PhD
B	yeah
A	you have to have research you have to have
B	oh well yeah you need to be a
A	yeah but in England you don't need to have much teaching experience
B	yeah
A	the way I'm going around about it I might actually be quite a good teacher by the time I'm a professor
B	yeah
A	rather than just being a professor that doesn't know how to teach you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	some people they go from school to masters to PhD without ever getting any work experience
B	mm yeah
A	and then they teach
B	yeah
A	and they teach in a uni
B	I know someone who's erm a professor he's only
A	yeah
B	so he does what he's into at the minute pharmaceutical writings
A	yeah
B	so he writes for drug companies basically a really well-paid job it's like eighty grand a year
A	mm
B	basically but he was a doctor well within
A	yeah
B	and he's fucking so intelligent
A	my friend my age he was really clever at school
B	mm
A	he's already a research fellow
B	mm
A	at Bristol University
B	oh really?
A	he's like a top fifteen
B	he's done a
A	it's crazy
B	so it's mental isn't it? so he gets like royalties for these drugs that he invents
B	mm
A	the plan is if we can get a foot in the door with Canada or America and we can spend three or four years and they have quite a bit of funding out there
B	yeah
A	or like as a foreign student you can get even more funding opportunities
B	mm
A	erm if we can get a three or four-year foot in the door it's only another year to get a fairly solid green card which would mean that
B	mm
A	so when we're older because I like England in many respects but quite a big one it fails for me
B	yeah
A	and that big one is land I don't
B	yeah no it's true it's a good point
A	it's
B	yeah
A	like most people I know pretty much are set at some point in our life
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm it's not gonna be in England
B	yeah
A	basically we can't afford to do it here
B	yeah
A	and we want a piece of I would rather have a bigger piece of land than a small house
B	yeah
A	do you know what mean? than a bigger house and a smaller piece of land
B	yeah
A	I'd rather have somewhere where I can farm a little bit and just
B	do a bit of farming
A	and you know like this big
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean? nothing bigger than here
B	yeah just there's only so much space you need really isn't there?
A	so it would be maybe Canada or America
B	yeah
A	I'm visiting my friends in Tennessee and like some of the houses they showed me were like a hundred thousand dollars and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
B	yeah
A	maybe two hundred thousand dollars and they've got like a completely standalone
B	mm
A	detached
B	yeah
A	they've got their own firing range I shot like M16s and shotguns and stuff when I was there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like about twenty years ago and he's lived he's got a massive house and it's like with quite a bit of land
A	mm they do
B	and stuff so it was like he said he was like I couldn't afford to move back to England now
A	no
B	he was like he was like I'd probably get the equivalent of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds for my house and he's like
A	it's crazy isn't it yeah
B	loads of land it's mental
A	my friend's just bought my friend's father has just bought five hundred the size of five hundred American football fields' worth of land in Kentucky
B	really?
A	for like not very much I mean it cost a lot of money but it's not as much as you'd think it would be
B	yeah
A	where in England could you buy five hundred football fields of land?
B	no it doesn't probably
A	no it doesn't exist
B	not even that bit of land exists
A	no you can't have it
A	so yeah
B	mm
A	so we're probably gonna have to do something like that
B	yeah
A	cos I can't see
B	but that's not a bad plan really
A	I can't see any other way that we're gonna get some land
B	yeah
A	and find
B	I want I wanna get me some land
A	basically
B	buy me a good woman
A	I'd really like to live in like Argentina or something
B	yeah
A	just a big country but the problem with like Argentina
B	politically quite unstable
A	yeah I mean oh it's such a beautiful country though like really friendly people you'd love it
B	well they're not like the best relations with the UK either
A	you like you like your coke you like coke you'd like it out there
B	yeah
A	it's all romantic tango music
B	yeah
A	European cocaine
B	mm
A	just whatever
B	mm
A	know what I mean?
B	cheap cocaine as well
A	not I'm not I'm not saying I did I didn't partake in any of that
B	cheap good cocaine
A	yes but from the the vibe around there was good
B	yeah
A	but erm the problem with living there is I'd need to live there first now their universities are not top notch
B	no
A	and the problem also and why I'm studying in England now I can't I
B	mm
A	and it was a top a hundred university the course was in English
B	yeah
A	they're basically bilingual but when I started
B	mm
A	and they basically told me they wouldn't accept it that it had to be from a native English speaking country
B	really?
A	so the same with our PhD we couldn't do one in Argentina therefore the only way we get a foot in the door is by working there for numerous years but the pay is so low
B	is it really?
A	in Latin America it's terrible
B	yeah
A	it's terrible I mean you'll learn a little bit more in Argentina than you will in say Mexico or somewhere like that
B	yeah
A	I'd love to teach in these places
B	yeah
A	they'd be really chilled really good lifestyle
B	there's no money though
A	and have a good thing but you I mean Mexico you can earn about five hundred dollars a month you know what I mean? about three hundred quid a month
B	yeah
A	you what? you I'm not gonna do shit with that
B	yeah that's ridiculous
A	Argentina you'll earn about a thousand dollars a month
B	oh really?
A	but that's still only about six hundred quid you know what I mean?
B	yeah exactly
A	and the country's not that cheap so
B	no
A	erm
B	no that's really true
A	so I have to I have to work where I can save
B	yeah
A	if because then I can just travel to these places but if I work there I can't save
B	yeah
B	did you?
A	yes it was quite sketchy it was a bit of a strange experience
B	really?
A	when you're travelling to have a job interview
B	yeah
A	we had to like I had to buy a suit and some trousers
B	did you really?
A	yeah yeah
B	what was it a job interview for?
A	it was at the British to teach English it was at the British Institute in San Diego in Chile
B	oh really?
A	it was like probably the best job we could have got in Latin America
B	mm
A	it paid about nine hundred pound a month erm
B	not bad
A	so it was more it was the highest job I could find like the best earning
B	yeah
A	but the problem was sorry this is quite a long anecdote to go into
B	yeah
A	just nattering like mad
B	yeah
A	changed our entire travel route and sped things up so that we can get to this people to have an interview with them
B	yeah
A	to take a job there in the future and we saw we didn't hear back from them we saw the same job advert in London
B	yeah
A	with the same specifications but you know all these benefits and all this kind of stuff
B	yeah
A	and I emailed the guy and said look we're still interested we're still coming
B	yeah
A	can I confirm that this is the same job? and he told me yeah
B	yeah
A	when we finally got there and I bought a suit and everything we went for the job interview
B	yeah yeah
A	like it just told us that we didn't wanna do that you know
B	yeah
A	you know we wanted to keep travelling but basically he wouldn't give us the same benefits that he was giving these people from London
B	really?
A	even though we've completely fit the criteria are from London
B	you're already there
A	and we came to you ourselves
B	yeah yeah
A	you know he was trying to haggle with me afterwards
B	yeah
A	over email and I basically told him look you can't offer me what we're after you know what I mean?
B	really?
A	and at that point we realised that if you can
B	so they were trying to get you for cheap basically?
A	yeah it well it for cheaper he could have
B	yeah
A	give perhaps given us what he'd offered them and even if he did I think we realised at this point that it still wasn't enough it still wasn't as good as what we're earning in Korea
B	yeah
A	and we were enjoying travelling
B	yeah
A	so why do we wanna stop travelling?
B	yeah
A	and work
B	yeah exactly
A	when I could just and from that point er we booked our tickets and a week later we flew to Nicaragua and just travelled
B	yeah
A	like central America for another six months
B	yeah that nice
A	and it was just like fuck working
B	South
A	yeah
B	you're cool man that looked really cool man South America
B	yeah I think I definitely would
A	it's maybe even more your style than erm than Asia I think
B	yeah I reckon so
A	yeah it's got a nice European flair to everything
B	mm
A	nice European food if you pay good money
B	yeah
A	central is pretty dangerous
B	yeah it is
A	mm
B	definitely all like the
A	I think yeah yeah
A	I mean I spent a good deal of time in Honduras which is pretty sketchy
B	mm
A	El Salvador which is meant to be like more than sketchy
B	that's all like they're all up for
A	oh yeah
B	there's like proper like gang warfare going on
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's mental
A	I went into some of the craziest gang places there's one guy on a bus showed me his piece just like lifted up his shirt and showed me his gun
B	really?
A	and I'm like what what do I do with this?
B	why?
B	yeah well what did he do that for?
A	I don't know I had so many drunk people target me on the bus and just try and talk to me for hours but the problem was that they were pissed off
B	yeah
A	cos they wanted to work in America and they had worked in America like everyone I met pretty much
B	yeah
A	for like two years
B	yeah
A	but then get kicked out and then they're trying to get back to America
B	really?
A	basically and they can speak a bit of English cos they've lived in the States for a couple of years
B	yeah
A	so they wanna talk to you but they're kind of drunk
B	yeah
A	and they're cynical and they're pissed off and they're
B	yeah
A	rather annoying so they just kind of they're not cool to be around
B	no
A	we had this black woman in this big bikini threw a rock at
B	really?
A	yeah big she was just wearing like nothing she was clearly crazy
A	just like threw a stone at us and
B	really? mental
A	I had a guy point a double-barrel shotgun at me because I got on a wooden jetty do you know like out at sea? you're just walking along the beach and there's a wooden jetty
B	yeah
A	not really big or anything
B	yeah
A	I stepped a foot on it and the guy shouted at me in Spanish pulled out a shotgun and he said that's private
B	really?
A	it's
A	and like oh
B	that's mental
A	I actually said to the guy are you gonna shoot me if I stand on it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	I was just like for real? like
B	yeah just pointing a gun at you
A	if I stand on that piece of wood you are gonna shoot me?
A	yeah I know
A	so it was a bit sketchy in places there was a lot of military presence a lot of police presence
B	really?
A	we went to a water park in El Salvador and it was just full of military like
A	yeah like in the park
B	yeah
A	in you're in a water park and there's people with big
B	yeah that's mental
A	it's a bit sketchy you'll you would I recommend to you to go to South American central's they've got some very impressive shit
B	yeah
A	but erm it's harder work definitely
B	I'd love to go to Peru actually
A	mm
B	I have to say
A	you would love it
B	it's so annoying when someone calls you on an unknown number it's the most annoying thing
A	why would you do that? oh you've got an iPhone have you?
B	mm
A	oh it's
B	yeah
A	very flash
B	is it? it's just pretty much standard these days to be honest mate
A	is it?
B	well yeah
A	I got given this one it probably looks really retro
B	oh that's quite cool though
A	it's pretty high tech to me
B	it's a smartphone
A	is it?
B	well
A	is that what makes it smart cos it's got like Android or whatever and it's got the internet on it?
B	it's got quite a low IQ but
A	yeah
B	it's a smartphone
A	it's smart enough it's in second set
B	mm yeah probably a bit below that
A	doesn't uni feel such a long time ago?
B	it was a long time ago mate it was fucking well seven years wasn't it?
A	I mean we graduated in 2008
B	yeah
A	it's two thousand and
B	it's just buzzed by really
A	yeah
B	absolutely buzzed by
A	it's kind of scary
B	it's not even funny
A	no it's been six years
B	yeah
A	what trips
B	yeah
A	but a part of you thinks we only knew each other for three years
B	yeah it's mental
A	and then there's been six years since then
B	yeah exactly
A	that we haven't been been around at all
B	yeah that is mental isn't it?
A	yeah
B	and I think of it like that sometimes
A	especially when you meet up with them and just click again
B	yeah
A	like
B	it is really
A	that time just hasn't passed
B	yeah it is pretty mental
A	so it's er yeah
B	just gone off
A	yeah so uni friends
B	yeah man
A	It's er I made some good friends at uni
B	mm
A	not too many in the end though some people have kind of gone a lot quieter
A	but it makes a bit of a difference
B	yeah I don't really keep in contact with anyone
A	I'm still in touch with you
B	yeah
A	and
A	and
B	yeah
A	I'm still in touch with

B	yeah
A	where I don't really wanna commit to meeting up with him but
B	yeah
A	but I don't wanna be unfriendly to him either
B	right
A	he'd gone through quite a bit of shit but that was always the way with it wasn't it at uni?
B	yeah
A	and that was always the same relationship I knew he was a dick but
B	but yeah exactly
B	yeah he's got epilepsy hasn't he?
A	yeah mate yeah

A	read the small print
A	no no no
B	it's fairly clear
A	it's big it's clear
B	it's a bit of a long form that I've got to fill in that you want me to fill in
A	it's actually quite interesting
A	I'm doing a slightly other linguistics exercise of recording people while they fill it in because some of these
B	there's a lot of personal details
A	I know well
B	what I would describe as
A	I'm selling your voice and what you're saying
B	are you really trying to get my personal details?
B	so you can come some kind of credit fraud
A	hang hang about no
A	otherwise it gets ten seconds

A	I cut and it's a pain in the arse to redo it all look this is proof these are how many I've got I've got my cousin another cousin my mate
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	that's a lot of personal details that you've got
A	yeah
B	who you gonna defraud first?

B	accent dialect
A	yeah I find it interesting to listen back to what people say at that point what do you think your accent is?
B	I dunno really
A	well if somebody asked you what accent do you have?
B	I'd just like
A	what dialect do you have?
B	say like just a normal one
A	just a normal on?

A	yeah there's definitely a brummie twang
A	what's a normal one?
B	erm just home counties
A	yeah
B	you know
A	just your local dialect your vernacular
B	er yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	what's the date today the twenty-eighth?
A	I don't know actually
B	what?
A	it's what it says
A	I apologise for that
A	yeah

B	twenty-ninth of August
A	cool
B	yeah no it is
A	do you want me to ask you and I fill it out?
B	no it's alright
A	are you sure? one of my friends

B	it's English
A	what's that one? which country has most influenced your language?
B	mm
A	Britain
B	erm
A	oh you've got to that interesting question
B	I don't really know
A	well what you said was pretty good normal with
A	some brummie twang didn't you say?
B	mm
B	erm home counties definitely
B	almost like so it's very well spoken and you know very kind of pronunciate your words really well and
A	I sound like a dick
B	or concentrate on each word or it's like a very acting voice
B	as theatrical that's what
A	twatty twattish would be a better er description
B	er normal
A	I think when I listen to myself on this thing it sounds awful
B	yeah
A	so what's this one?
B	yeah
A	Britain
A	what's your town?
B	er
A	it's
A	I mean it's quite important
A	there's a distinction don't confuse
B	er how long have I lived here for now? is it less than five years?
A	there's a cordon sanitaire
B	yeah
B	er
A	what about in
B	oh yeah well yeah obviously
A	yeah so cool
B	thought you've got to

A	yeah
A	I mean surely if you've got to graduate then
B	job role or position
A	yeah what was your title again?
B	er assurance
A	gift of the gab assuring people
B	yeah
B	er it does actually yeah a great deal of advice and stuff
A	you said you kind of liaise don't you between different departments and different places or something?
B	er yeah I well don't yeah I don't have to go into the intricacies of my job role right now
B	topic or subject
A	various
B	on the recording yeah various artists
A	yeah
B	just to fuck up people with iPods
A	various artists yeah
A	good old Peep Show
A	er now you've got to read the small print
B	oh bloody hell can you read it loud to me in a theatrical voice?
A	in a theatrical
A	do you just mean how I normally talk?
B	well no just be more theatrical than normal
A	Cambridge University Press a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge and Lancaster University are collecting samples of spoken and written English from a wide range of sources
B	are they?
A	apparently so
A	have a read
B	yeah carry on reading I didn't mean to interrupt your flow
A	no I I probably shouldn't
B	why not?
A	it's just me reading
A	it's
A	so if anything
A	basically just himself
B	thinks he's Stephen Fry
B	mm
A	so pretty much as a historian if future historians wanna look back
B	that's very true
A	on a bit of social commentary
B	mm
A	and look back to what the British public sounded like and what they spoke about in the year 2014 you will be a part of that data
B	mm
A	you will be archived forever in time
B	it's quite an exciting prospect isn't it?
A	mm yeah regardless of whatever else you do in the rest of your life you will be marked down now they know your name they know your personal details and this is what you sounded like
B	erm it feels
A	do you still study history at all?
B	erm
A	in your own time?
B	well not really no
A	no
A	where?
B	I should hope not
A	no that's the first first and only time
B	that was really arduous
A	it was arduous
B	that was over there somewhere
A	I'm sorry
A	you definitely have a brummie accent
B	do you reckon so?
A	yeah you do
B	is that good?
A	it's not thick you don't have a thick brummie accent
B	no
A	did you ever see Peaky Blinders? Peaky Blinders
B	bloody hell mate that was shocking
A	did you not like it?
B	that was awful
A	oh I thought it was alright but I have
B	the
A	they have no relation to to to Birmingham so
B	the brummie accents in Peaky Blinders was
B	it was diabolical
A	what do you think about the guy out of Jurassic Park doing a an Irish accent?
B	which guy out of Jurassic Park?

B	yeah
A	just different actors and different language it's weird it hasn't come out yet
B	that is weird
A	it's called
B	well to be honest it does make sense because it's got that sort of Latin American edge hasn't it Breaking Bad

A	oh what?
B	but but it's like three quid
A	yeah well
B	so it makes it seems like oh yeah you know three quid for a pouch of tobacco but
A	I mean how much was twelve and a half grams? surely that was like two pound fifty or something
B	well that used
A	yeah
B	it well
A	how much did it go up to?
B	well it's
A	how much are one of these nowadays cos it was
B	it's about four

A	it was about nine pound fifty
B	it's about yeah nineteen twenty quid now

A	in six years
B	uh-huh
A	have you has your wages doubled in six years?
A	no
B	of course they haven't
A	some things stabilised I remember when cheese doubled and like other things doubled
B	yeah
A	but it's a bit more stable lately
B	yeah
A	it hasn't been too bad
B	no man
A	I've noticed that the price of alcohol has definitely gone up
B	oh yeah
A	when you go in a shop you can't get like a cheap bottle of Sainsbury's own brand for eight nine pound anymore it's like thirteen pound to sixteen pound
B	yeah yeah it's
