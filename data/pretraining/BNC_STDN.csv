A	peas and kale and
B	I salted the kale and peas but I didn't salt the chips
C	okay
A	do we not have any mayonnaise?
B	erm we should have mayo
A	oh
B	erm
A	do you get the Hellman's one?
B	I get the jar usually
A	this has got lemon in it or something Hollandaise
B	mm that needs to go in the bin
A	grimness
B	so it's not there
A	mm
B	that is a disaster
A	disaster chips without mayo is like
B	it's a disaster
A	the sun without the moon
C	so Scotland have trashed Japan have they?
B	yeah obviously Japan were up for it
A	even worse
B	with South Africa they thought they'd give it their best shot and that was it that's all they could they do they've got nothing left
A	now they're rubbish
C	I think this deserves even more comments tomorrow
A	mm supposed to wearing a rose to support the er England team
C	mm
A	there's a little advert not very little actually
B	last time I they did what I thought was a great advert that was kind of how the how everybody hates the English as the rugby team erm as the so it was Ireland to advertise the three the Ireland England Scotland Wales against each other
A	oh the Five Nations?
B	whatever it is
A	Six Nations
B	the Six Nations erm but it was a great advert it was kind of like all of the different nations shown up in pubs and all round the place all cheering for the wrong team they're all cheering for whoever was playing England I thought it was really great and I
A	no way?
B	yeah
B	they said it was like racist or something
A	that's silly
B	it was proper silly cos the English really can laugh at themselves that's the only good thing you know that the you know you could honestly say it was the English advert of the English laughing at themselves
A	well England Australia's going to be a big one isn't it?
C	mm certainly
B	are we in the same group as Wales and Australia?
C	we are yeah
B	oh god
A	that's why it was important to beat Fiji
B	mm I see it
A	they were like kind of the less good people
B	so they could do with beating Wales as well then
C	could do with winning everything
A	they could do with an unbroken streak of
C	mm
A	reduced salt and sugar sauce did dad buy it?
B	no I think I might have
C	how dare you?
A	grimness I don't like reduced things
A	so I didn't quite understand which part of grandma's alarm wasn't working if she did manage to
B	so it's on her wrist and there's a button that she can press so say she was just in distress and she just pressed the button
A	right
B	but it's also supposed to automatically go off if she falls
A	oh and that's the part that didn't
B	that's the design of it and she's had a number of falls
A	did she fall on her arm? or not
B	no she feel at the bottom of the stairs she was just going towards the stair lift we think
C	that's right yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	er but you don't know if she grabbed onto something did it break her fall? did she just fall you know? did she just kind of stumble down slowly rather than just go crash
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but
A	you need to check if it's working how it should be?
B	check if it's working
A	but then she can press it manually
B	mm
A	mm
B	but I suppose the idea is if she's so hurt that she's not
A	able to yeah
B	able to press it that's
A	grandad has one as well doesn't he? grandad
B	mm
C	he has a cord yeah
A	cord yeah
B	so his is not so ideal in that he has to be able to reach the cord
A	reach it yeah
C	yeah
A	worry about him less but it's not really I mean he sort of bounds around doesn't he?
C	mm yeah
B	he's no I don't think about him falling as such although it could of course happen
A	yeah
B	but whereas grandma you need something to
A	it happens a lot doesn't it?
B	cos that's going to happen a lot
A	yeah
B	and they've rung up from the care people and said she needs to move the bed away from the wall so she can get the frame in
A	right yeah that was always a tricky one the bed wasn't it?
B	mm and erm
A	that's depressing though
B	mm
A	isn't it?
B	a luxury single bed like hers but that goes up and down and everything but he bought it at their house she didn't want it then she was very very angry and they said why don't you change over to it and she just said no she doesn't want to move out of their bed either
A	no that's too much
B	mm
B	oh good
A	but she erm is working in London on Monday and Tuesday
B	oh lord
A	so she's just mulling it over
B	mm
A	she said she'd really like to come but she's not she just needs to sort of piece it together in her mind a bit mm especially if we go if you know like I said for the morning
B	come back after lunch
A	yeah to pick
B	mm
A	so
B	it's about an hour and a half isn't it?
A	yeah it is it is especially in the weekdays it's quite busy like we normally go on a Sunday but she's going up to see
B	mm
A	and then the M6 is less scary
B	mm mm
A	but midweek it is quite can be quite slow can't it?
B	I don't know I think Sunday can be quite bad cos it's
A	yeah that's true everyone's going to their family aren't they?
B	mm
A	Sunday afternoon is worse like on the way back we had some traffic last time I think but
B	mm
A	that's the last thing you want isn't it? stuck in a queue on the M6 on your day off
C	we've done a bit of that
B	mm
A	be better to go on the train
B	the last two times or might not be two in a row but it's two recent it's taken over five hours to get to grandma's
A	oh my god
B	cos the M6 had a queue
B	it was horrendous
A	that's so depressing
C	horrible
A	we saw that didn't we? even on the way back from seeing
B	as soon as there's anything mm
A	it was just miles and miles and miles
B	mm
C	have you seen that Mr Volkswagen resigned
B	mm
A	did he? that was only only really next step wasn't it?
B	mm he could have just been sacked
A	so he was fully aware of what was going on?
C	no he said I have no knowledge of this and it it's I'm totally erm dismayed by the whole event
A	oh dear
C	but it's my responsibility and we need a fresh start
B	is he Mr American Volkswagen or Mr
C	Mr Mr overall Volkswagen
A	he's the chief exec Mr
B	oh god
A	yeah
B	oh no
A	he's a nice German name
B	poor them
A	yeah well he I mean he knew even if he wasn't directly culpable it's like you have to hold someone that person accountable don't you? to what's going on
C	yes exactly
C	unlike Mr Blatta
A	who's Mr Blatta?
C	the er don't you know about this FIFA thing
A	no
C	FIFA being the international regulation body for football
B	mm
C	and in particular they organise the World Cup
A	yeah
C	and erm there's been a terrible scandal because erm
B	well there's been scandals for years
C	a large a large number of the executive committee have been found to be involved with corruption
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	fixing and their news and prices and things but Mr Mr Blatta is the Swiss head of FIFA and he refused any knowledge of it any responsibility for it
A	really?
C	he
B	it's been going on for ten years
C	he
A	are you serious
B	because of all the bribes
A	cos of the all corrupt people
C	then he resigned saying I'm resigning but it's it's nothing to do with me really
B	no he said it wasn't really a resignation and I could be up for election again he's quite something
A	he's a bit of a dodge character
C	meanwhile a lot of his board have been taken up by the FBI and held on remand or whatever the expression is
A	the likelihood of him knowing nothing about it is approximately zero isn't it?
C	well exactly
B	mm and you know it's even which countries the it's all been held in the World Cup over the last three or four times and the ones that are already booked in to come have had to pay huge amount to get the World Cup
C	they were bribed basically
B	and that's why you know people who did it the normal way without bribes didn't get it
A	oh so the suggestion is that the hosting country have to
B	have all paid huge bribes South Africa included
C	well this this is
C	especially
A	oh my god
C	and now the football nations are refusing to play
A	that's ridiculous temperatures
C	that is clearly a
B	but no they're very wealthy
C	clear that they'd paid for to get the World Cup to go to them
A	absolutely well what's it supposed to be based on?
B	er
C	football tradition I suppose
B	no
A	merit
B	they put forward a whole don't they? just like the Olympics each country has to put forward proposals where the grounds are make their case
A	the stadiums and so forth
B	what you know what they'll do for the communities how it will be run blah blah blah blah blah the infrastructure
A	I'm sure your average Qatari is not seeing much of that cash
A	well I don't know how it works but often in these countries it's a very rich elite isn't it?
B	mm
C	yes
A	I like it when like
B	totally all all of the Europeans
A	how can you do that?
B	establishments are all entirely against him but because it's the other nations the Asian's and the African's that are paying the bribes they love him cos they can't get it they haven't got a chance otherwise
A	well in
C	that's the system
B	mm
A	it's not like corruption like a system
B	well that's why they keep on getting voted in
A	it's the way it works you know and there's a whole hierarchy of bribes going on
C	I'm sure
A	erm you you
C	yeah
B	the pyramid
A	a pyramid of bribes and er and that's how you get things done and even if you happen to have a run in with someone you
C	there was a
A	mm
B	erm the English media and the English footballing association have been really put out by him because all sorts of things haven't been able to happen that could have happened and so they're really very unhappy and have been for as long as I've known them and called him corrupt and tried to bring it him to and they couldn't pin anything down never can pin anything down on him never can sort of do
A	how's he managing that?
B	erm and the the chief
C	yeah
B	shown up all of the things that he's done and blah blah blah he just says was ne me
A	was ne me I'm surprised he's not Italian
C	oh we're going
A	oh dear
B	merci buckets
A	yeah
B	in the micro
C	oh oh oh
A	oh definitely yeah I'll put it with something else
B	mm
A	it's quite nice the kale isn't it?
B	mm
A	salty
B	it was a bit salty
A	no but I like it like that
B	mm
C	I've had a reply from Mr
A	oh did you?
B	mm
C	yes he made some very very sort of pointed remark about
A	what did he say?
C	is that we should er get some strong people to help with the removals on second thoughts you could always ask
A	he's not a he's not a he's not a pointed remark is it? no but what's funny is that his nephew is he smallest child of the of you know he's in like the fifth percentile or something
B	he was saying that mm
A	and so it's it's just funny and he's four years old and he's just a just a tiny little thing
B	mm mm
A	and so it was surprising you know for
A	he's funny he's a rugby player
B	biff you've got a very poor method of
