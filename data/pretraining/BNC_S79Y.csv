A	what
C	a politician
A	what were you gonna do in court? if you're ever in court and a and a lawyer asked you a question and you don't want to answer will you just go

C	hold you in contempt of court
A	we were saying dad imagine
C	oh no
A	I don't know
C	don't know
B	I think you could probably make
C	well that be construed as bit bit like The Undateables sort of mocking
C	it would be worse than The Undateables yeah
B	you'd just call it
A	and then you feel
B	and then of course people would think oh what a cute kid and that you know by the end of the first series
C	but they'd also be laughing at him
B	yeah I know but
C	I don't think
C	yes
B	and he will you know you just like follow him around the town and a sort of semi documentary but there's a bit of bit like Towie you know so it's
A	you can't script
C	no you can't tell
A	is he in
C	I think he's at
A	well obviously but I'm not going anywhere am I? so
C	no I don't mean today I meant at some point in
A	yeah obviously
C	he likes his little day out with you
C	yes
A	ah
C	well yeah
C	and ever since the
A	no
C	I mean he saw you and then he didn't see you for nearly a year and then he's were hello
C	and it's not like hi we haven't seen you in ages is it?
A	I know
C	hello
A	I know it's cos he doesn't think past the moment
C	no no
A	he
C	what a lovely world to live in
A	I know
C	but then again he has no well I don't think anyway he he hasn't got any lovely memories to hold cos as you say he lives in the moment what's gone is gone he doesn't
A	but he doesn't need memories he doesn't think oh damn it I wish I had some
C	no cos memories help us learn and he doesn't need to cos everybody else does it for him
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's what he likes to do
C	why have you just taken away my little
A	she's actually purring into the microphone
C	oh I see
A	and it's gonna be loud stop it we don't want you on there you can't sign the consent form
A	oh for god's sake
C	bring her over here I'll have her
A	you have her
C	oh my little puss cat aren't you?
A	yeah how come when
C	I don't mind
A	oh that's cute because it
C	nudging my arm with her wet nose
A	that's cute because it means she wants another stroke
C	oh no it's like
A	I was
C	that's nasty
A	apparently it's been illegal for thirty years but erm
C	where?
A	here in this country
C	has it was it ever legal?
A	well I don't think there was ever a specific law against it obviously
C	I suppose it was
A	butchering someone is
C	yeah
A	I mean
C	I suppose people weren't really aware of it for a long time
A	exactly yeah
C	yeah anyway yeah
A	erm
C	oh why has nobody ever been prosecuted over here?
A	no one's ever been prosecuted
C	yeah
A	or investigated
C	really?
A	not by doctors necessarily like most of the time by you know family members or
C	mm
A	and stuff like that
C	mm
A	and bringing people to justice because he was brought to he was brought to court because erm this woman had a baby and her she'd had it done when she was six she came into hospital
C	oh god
A	and she was bleeding
C	I thought they had it done in their teens
A	well this girl this woman had it done and she was from Somalia she had it done in Somalia and
C	oh right
A	came over and erm she was bleeding apparently and he undid the stitches
C	oh
A	erm and then afterwards
C	but was
A	yeah
C	oh well that's not his fault
A	I know but that's that's what people were saying that's why he was acquitted because
C	oh
A	he was
C	right
A	the one they chose for some reason and erm he erm he's been yeah he's not he hasn't gone to prison or anything now he's back in his job but
C	mm
A	because he did it erm
C	but did he do it because he thought that was the best thing for her? because otherwise
A	yeah cos it was bleeding
C	yeah
A	so he stitched it back up
C	yeah
A	erm and he
C	yeah
A	she was bleeding he needed to get her into theatre quickly and he had it had to be very quick
C	yeah
A	he didn't have time to kind of
C	right is is he a Somalian doctor or?
A	no he comes from Sri Lanka and he's a Hindu so
C	right
A	it was like part of his defence was it's not his cultural background so
C	yeah
A	he's
C	I wouldn't I wouldn't
A	to want her
C	I've no idea what a FGM looks like
A	I know apparently that's what he said as well
C	right
A	and he's never seen one before and he's got no reason in his cultural background to want to do it and stuff like that
C	yeah
A	erm and
C	oh it's a stupid stupid one to bring to court
A	I know
C	why don't they just get one of those fathers who have just done it to their daughter and bring them to court?
A	yeah I know
C	mm
A	but erm
C	yeah
A	because it's not big enough if you've had an FGM to have a baby
C	so how do they manage out in the blooming?
A	probably die
C	yeah
A	erm and then they said to each other okay we'll erm
C	mm
A	we won't restore the FGM we'll put it back as a nice vagina
C	neatly
A	neatly
B	excuse me
A	and apparently the husband
C	oh my god
A	and she said erm they were alone it was it was the middle of the night they were kind of alone in the hospital in that area of the hospital and the three women and this man was really threatening
C	I would have phoned security
A	yeah
C	and had him arrested
A	but then I guess you wouldn't want him to go home with her if he said that
C	mm
A	you'd rather do it yourself wouldn't you?
C	mm
A	but yeah it's a bit weird it's a weird cultural thing that they
C	it is really weird I don't I wonder where it came from why?
A	I don't know
C	really weird
A	it's strange
A	why did you let her?
C	oh cos she's quite funny the way she does it she came out of the bathroom
C	and she said oh I need some of this and
A	if I did that you wouldn't let me
C	erm you're always nicking my stuff excuse me what about my coconut oil?
A	yeah
A	yeah carry on
C	she said I need some and I've only just bought it the day before she said I need some of this I'm taking this with me and went to put it I said no I want that that's mine I've only just bought it she said oh well oh you oh I don't know she's just quite funny
C	and in the end I went oh okay
C	erm
A	you did you did say that
C	no she was going to give it him wasn't she? I've forgotten the story now he asked for it
A	he asked for it but you said I thought you wanted two
C	oh yeah that's right
A	and she said oh I couldn't refuse and you went oh
C	yeah yeah but
A	and you did this
C	there's a difference with a Kindle and a bottle of dry shampoo
C	oh then and I I keep forgetting to buy any ever since then when I go into town
A	it's okay mummy
C	oh I daren't have any
A	oh no what's gonna happen? oh no you're gonna go from an egg over toast to two for every day oh no
C	I'll probably die from constipation if I eat too many more eggs
A	I can tell you you won't
C	mm
A	oh hello little
C	ah look at her
A	like a soporific reverie isn't he?
C	mm you know I said soporific the other day though and
B	mm
C	working and I said to

A	what did you say?
C	I
B	I've never heard of it
C	have you not?
B	reverie no
A	have you not? I've heard reverie maybe from you
B	I've heard it but I don't know what it's about apart from a bicker
A	no it's a sort of erm
B	that's a reverie or a
A	it's kind of like you're in a state
C	a dreamlike state
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	a reverie
C	soporific
A	it sounds like I feel it sounds like what it is a reverie I'm in a reverie
C	yeah soporific means sort of you're er feeling
A	you know what soporific means don't you? he knows what soporific is
C	yeah I know but it but when when it's kind of like the sound of the same as soporific and it's not the same as soporific is it reverie?
A	I guess no
C	soporific is sort of
A	sleepy
C	a feeling I think I guess and reverie is a state of
A	being
C	yeah where you are
A	mm
C	she made me she makes me laugh
A	maybe you are using
C	no it's not cos I googled soporific to cos I'm not very good at explaining definitions of words
A	yeah yeah
C	explain it so I googled it while they were there and it said a dreamlike state
A	no I mean I know it's a real word but I mean maybe you are using words people don't use
C	oh I see
A	bet
A	maybe she's been on a diet
C	what's the time?
A	yes I'm going to eat some boiled egg now dad oh hello
