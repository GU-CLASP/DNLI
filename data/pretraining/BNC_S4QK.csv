B	that's three
A	that's USB three
B	oh
B	it'll fit cos they're normally
A	let's have a look I'll just go and find have a little quick look at the dimensions of it
B	is that is that centimetres?
A	yeah
B	what?
A	right yeah
B	but it said frequently bought together so I'm assuming that they fit
A	yeah it must
B	have you got a ruler?
B	or is it millimetres?
A	oh yeah
B	the
A	what are the internal dimensions? eight point five centimetres by eleven
B	yeah so that's fine
A	by eight point one
B	that should be fine
A	yeah that's fine that's fine we good we good what are you worrying for
B	I wasn't it was you
B	it's not like you've
A	well

A	you know the one about the rape
B	Blurred Lines
A	yeah

A	mm
B	I just realised the other day that it's not the like censored version
A	oh is it not?
B	so it was like really quiet and there was like loads of old people sat there
B	well technically a bitch is only a you know it's only a swearword now but it you know did used to just mean a female dog so
A	well yeah that is true
B	and you can see
B	no maybe that's what the old people thought you know maybe it was in their time that you know it literally was just bitch
A	but even then
B	as in the dog
A	even then that would mean that Robin Thicke is into bestiality
B	well I wouldn't put it past him would you?
B	I don't know the man but
A	yeah he's a bit of a dick
A	bit of a dick
B	what well I was busy
A	yeah
B	and he was playing real loud music
A	he always does
B	I think might as well just oh shit I nearly pulled the cable out
A	fuck

A	woo
B	you got my man boots
A	and someone has pinned my pin
A	pinned your pin?
B	mm
A	a pin pin pin pin pin pin
B	so that woman has not got back to me

A	right
B	like cos you can normally book things through Tripadvisor can't you?
A	yeah
B	so I didn't realise till I looked at it again yesterday
A	yeah
B	but it's not actually my fault because I linked everyone to the stuff to have a look at and nobody's actually done it
A	yeah
B	so they've not noticed either so
