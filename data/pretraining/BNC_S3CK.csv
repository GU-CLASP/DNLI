A	yeah
B	like in erm erm what's that one with the ostrich and it's just running and then there's like the wolf thing that tries to eat it?

A	oh oh I see
B	silly cartoon bit
A	yeah but the yeah I think they're supposed to be quite good some of them but some of them aren't supposed to be pretty graphic and a little bit violent aren't they? the ones that I heard although some of them are good
B	it's possible that's like that's like just saying some TV shows are like that cos anime is anime is everything basically
A	right I'm just checking that the ones you're watching aren't are they?

A	do you know what makes them do that?
B	plates? tectonic plates?
A	yeah I mean well it's very hard to predict
A	or you might see it in the film that why would they not predict that? why would it be commotion? cos cos around San San Francisco around there they're cos obviously it's very important for them to know when it's going to come
B	because it's because they're
A	yeah I can't really remember enough of the
