B	and that's the first thing that kills people off
A	I don't
B	or with clear fluid
A	she said people would come to her and

B	right
A	I was er I was in such horrendous pain
B	yeah
A	I didn't think about

B	oh
A	and of course in those days nobody ever thought that it might be stitched back on again or anything like that
B	no no
A	and so
B	oh gosh and

A	that persuaded her
B	yes
A	so she did
B	yes
A	to an absurd extent
B	exactly
A	yes
B	well the thing about having a near death experience is it makes you for a while for a while must be five years
A	yes
B	I think she might've done but she was always
A	yes

A	little boats
B	right
A	and
B	yes
A	he would calm her down and quieten her
B	oh yes
A	so she did it to keep everybody else quiet
B	mm
A	but
B	the contrast between you having your er wonderful er early childhood and then everything changing after your mother's accident erm is very stark isn't it?
A	it is but I had
