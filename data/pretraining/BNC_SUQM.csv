B	yeah
A	and er there'd be
B	yeah
A	and then you know we started about eight o'clock and then at midnight the midnight train would come in and we'd have to unload some more trolleys
B	yeah
A	and er we're suppose to spend all night
B	yeah
A	we used to have this sort of rule that you weren't allowed to do more than twelve twelve trolleys
A	then we used to stop by which time it was about ten o'clock and then we'd
B	yeah
A	and then we'd unload them trolleys
A	and then
B	yeah
A	cos there was two big erm
B	oh yeah yeah
A	you know and they used to ship out all these thousands of catalogues
B	yeah
A	and we had to put them into the areas where we went to and then bind them up into bundles and there were always
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah yeah
A	could easily have done if you worked right through
B	that's terrible innit?
A	but these people
B	yeah
A	and they didn't want to let it be known that it was possible for to do everything
B	that's right yeah
A	otherwise they'd say oh how come this day suddenly
B	yeah
A	you'd done all this whereas before you'd only been doing so much of a day?
B	yeah
A	really cos you know
B	yeah I went one when I used to work at
A	oh yeah
B	cos I was working on the caps and lags and and setting them all up and doing and er the foreman come up he says look it takes a minute and a half to do one of those cogs or whatever I was taking a minute and a half okay?
B	righto then and you have to do it by hand you see
A	mm
B	and it was so boring taking your time like that you know
A	yeah
B	and getting your coppers out and getting the
B	out and measuring that
A	mm
B	you know it was and the time and motion bloke would be there like that you
A	mm
B	literally in about thirty seconds
A	yeah
A	well exactly and like when you think about what you were doing there that's like outta the ark innit?
B	that's outta the ark yeah yeah
A	and now you get these automated
B	yeah yeah
A	and they just like spit them out dum dum dum dum and they're all every one is more accurate than you could do if you spent a month on it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and so well I've probably told you the story before I got so fed up with it I just went round and switched all the machines off
B	and the bloke says what are you doing? I said I'm now going home you can't go home what about us? I says well you can look after it yourself I'm off
A	yeah
B	for the rest of my life I'm not doing this I can't
A	all you gotta do now read a blueprint and feed the
B	yeah
A	the readings into the into the machine
B	into the
A	and that's all done on remote computers and
B	yeah
A	probably you don't even need to read you just copy the blueprint into the machine and that reads itself
B	you needn't be an engineer anymore need you?
A	well no
B	no
A	the only engineers now are in erm
B	yeah yeah
A	where you get so many
B	yeah you have to make yeah that's true yeah
A	or in stuff like
B	tool making
A	tool making robot making
B	yeah yeah
A	all this sort of stuff
B	yeah
A	where it's all
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and somebody got to make the robots and stuff like that
A	but there again you've got these
B	robots make robots
A	in another
B	god yeah
A	you know we're going there it ain't gonna be long
B	it ain't gonna be long is it?
A	and you won't need anyone to do anything with you
B	it's a
A	all you need is a designer just to make the picture
B	yeah
A	a 3D picture
B	that's it yeah
A	and that'll be it
B	I mean they
A	yeah
B	with plastic bullets too
A	well no they fire real bullets I think
B	well they can fire real bullets but they make because they they were talking about this on on on one of the programmes I was watching making these plastic bullets is as easy as making a a real bullet
A	mm
B	but the only thing they can see in the X-ray is the
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	yeah well they reckon that they can print ready-to-use mobile phones
B	that's right yeah
A	or they will be
B	it will yeah
A	or
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	god I dunno it'll either be really fantastic or horrendous
B	well in the in the sixties when I was out to work
A	mm
B	well that didn't work out in the sixties
A	no
B	yeah ever before yeah
A	yeah maybe cos
B	stay at home yeah
A	stay at home and raise a family
B	yeah
A	then the blokes could earn enough to keep them
B	to keep them going yeah
A	keep them going well it's that's the main difference I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't mind
B	well that's right
A	but you can't afford to now
B	no you
A	mm mm
B	right?
A	yeah
B	I don't know what what's that? that's supposed to be a third third of your wages innit? your mortgage?
A	I don't know but anyway yeah but
B	it was
A	but the proportion like ten pound a week versus three hundred quid is a lot smaller than it is now though isn't it?
B	that is yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	you know but it's funny that you know the the
B	well every
A	well that was quite unusual though
B	that was quite unusual yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	which is really weird when you think about that I don't know how I know that Provident man used to come around every every week so
A	well were they new houses or?
B	brand new built by
A	yeah well that'd be the difference you see
B	yeah
A	that'll be the difference cos they were built to sell
B	yeah
A	as opposed I mean people didn't
B	yeah I expect they were
A	that's cos they were owned by the rich people who rented them
B	yeah well my gran used to live up
A	that's where I had a house up
B	did you?
A	yeah really?
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and they
A	mm mm
B	where they used to go and get the water
A	whereabouts is it?
B	this was up
A	right
B	right up the top of
A	oh I'm sure it has yeah
B	but er I used to go when I was an apprentice I used to bike from from
B	and funnily enough
A	mm
B	she used to give me two Player's Whites to take back with me
A	oh really?
B	I was sixteen at the time she used to give me two Players Whites
A	yeah well they were considered healthy in those days
B	they were weren't they? yeah
A	yep
B	weird innit?
A	yeah I should be mowing actually I should be mowing the lawn soon
B	well come and see the bird table first you'll see all the lovely birds ouch these are a bit hard these chairs
A	ah
B	yeah okay
B	ah there's there's been er
A	long-tailed tits
B	long-tailed tits by the million
A	squirrel
B	yeah there's a squirrel and now there's nothing look
A	yeah I do you notice that they sort of birds feed
B	at certain times
A	at sort of like half past nine to half past ten
B	yeah
A	and then sort of like in the afternoon as well weren't it?
B	that's right
A	and in the other times you just get occasional visits
B	yeah that's right you do that's really weird because at between half past three and half past four we get a crowd of er long-tailed tits
A	mm mm
B	on that caged one they get inside that cage
A	yeah
B	and er the other ones all all sit on the I had to stick a a metal sheath round that plastic one that hangs down there cos the squirrel ate through it
B	so I put a metal sheath all the way around it
A	uhu
B	and he's still trying to eating through it
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	birdfeeders to stop the squirrels getting in
B	that'll stop the squirrels that really do
A	mm
B	cos all all eh little birds the sparrows can't get in and the robins can't get in unfortunately
A	well they should be able to get in through there should they?
B	they can just get their head in but the robin can't get in
A	really?
B	he's no he can't get in
A	that's strange
B	yeah
A	what they can't get through the mesh?
B	no they can't he can't get through the mesh I ain't seen the robin get inside it yet
A	well actually it's a bit close isn't it?
B	yeah
A	well that measures
B	no?
A	but that's a big cage and the robins get in there easily
B	really? oh
A	but you see if he gets his head through there he's where's he going to stand?
B	well that's right yeah
A	you know?
B	he can't get in there are you back?
D	I'm back
B	we're in here now watching the budgies
D	mm?
A	we were watching the birds but
D	oh right
B	but there's no birds to watch
A	they're all scared off
D	really?
B	they're all gone
A	yeah
B	that's full of fat and seeds
A	uhu
B	there's apples as well and bits of bread on the top there but the squirrel get all that stuff he don't get he don't eat that fat one though the fat fella he eat the rest of the stuff
D	the squirrel hasn't been on there either?
A	I never had much you know them fat balls you can get?
B	yeah?
A	I never birds won't just won't eat that round mine
B	won't they?
A	no
B	oh they
A	and the same with peanuts I put peanuts in the feeder and they just hang there till they go mouldy
B	yeah?
D	oh
A	strange innit?
D	mm
A	then I sort of clean them out and used different types of peanuts and stuff but they do really like the erm
B	yeah they like the sunflower seeds
A	but
D	yes they do
A	I got sunflowers heads there and they won't touch them
B	they don't touch the heads? no
A	no with the seeds in
D	cos they've got to crack the
B	I'll tell you what do what will eat the seeds off the sunflowers
A	squirrels
B	goldfinch the goldfinches eat the seeds out the sunflowers
A	they'll pick them out
B	yeah
A	yeah I'd have thought anything would do you
B	it's all my didn't get one from you
A	didn't you?
B	no
A	well I
B	no
D	there's some quite good ones there
B	she likes her funny cards yeah
B	you caught it up down the road then?
D	yeah it was at
D	yeah
B	wow
B	oh right I didn't hear you say it was at the
D	yeah
B	it's four and a half miles as well
D	no it's not it's about two
B	you must have done about fifty mile an hour
D	oh well it's four and a half altogether yeah
D	no but erm
A	did you have to sign up again or you had at cancel? renew your subscription was it?
D	no I didn't say anything
D	I was gonna say it if it if it had been the usual bloke that we see
B	yeah we see him yeah
A	but you know one time with the library you could
D	I think he was foreign
A	you could order books from other libraries
B	yes you can yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	at a cost
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	it would cost you though at one time it was free wasn't it?
B	it was free yeah we never paid at our library at the mobile one
D	yeah but we had paid a lot didn't we?
B	yeah
D	erm in the past
B	yeah we had yeah
D	yeah
B	huh?
D	well if it was if it had been I was going to explain to him that couldn't get in on the to renew them on the net online
B	oh right
D	but I thought I'd just leave this this guy he seemed er
A	why why couldn't you renew online?
D	was he German or something?
B	they won't let us renew online anymore they say your subscription has gone you know
A	what you've got to do it down
B	expect we'll have to go
D	probably yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	anyway the books are back in
B	that's good
D	we got a an overdue notice sent by email
B	and then they wouldn't accept them
D	yeah
B	over the net
A	I don't know last time last time I used the library I went in you know and you sort of scan your books and put your thing in no no it don't work and we I went to the woman I said oh I've been trying to she said hang on a minute let's have a look at your card
D	oh I see is that what happens? do you have to keep getting a new card?
A	well the card only runs it's got a date on it apparently have you looked at your card?
D	no we've had it ever since we
A	yeah?
D	oh a long long time
B	we've had it for donkey's years
A	yeah well so had I
D	oh right
A	but I hadn't been to the library
D	it still goes in the their
B	got a new one?
D	mind you they can't tell us anything about our account on there can they?
A	I don't think I've got it with me
B	there's the budgies look
A	yeah
B	I didn't know that
D	ah right okay
B	we're probably out of date then
B	I'll be
A	you've got a lot of cards
B	yes everybody loves me don't they? except
D	they like the peanut one
A	yeah
A	don't understand it
B	what's that?
A	what it says on there
D	that's cos he printed it wrong
A	what does it say though?
D	you will work out how to pull this
A	oh
D	erm
A	thing
D	I can't sort it out but I'm sure you can
A	oh I see
D	yeah so this is a very
B	that's artistic
A	right
D	but he he wouldn't have sent anything but
B	his girlfriend
D	yeah
A	his new girlfriend?
D	yeah that's right
B	yeah
D	same birthday
B	same as
A	oh I see right
D	he was saying he brought round a card for us to sign for her right?
A	mm mm
D	so he he brought a card and we just had to sign it you see? so
B	that's right yeah
D	hers was cos she's sixty
B	she was sixty his girlfriend is sixty you see
D	so that's why the significant
A	someone else has gotta wait till they're sixty-six to get a pension
B	that's right yeah
D	yeah mm
B	it's a long while innit?
A	it blooming is it's like
D	yeah
B	that's terrible
A	you try and support yourself
B	it's awful it's awful
D	yeah
A	it is cos I mean I
B	it's not fair
D	I wouldn't want to do it anymore
A	but then it's but then it's the thing about it is that there's millions of women in the same boat ain't there?
B	yeah
A	and like from now on every woman's got to work all them longer hours
B	yeah
A	and then you get this sort of like people our age are people who started work when they were sixteen
B	that's it yeah
A	you know whereas like kids nowadays they don't start work till they're twenty do they?
B	yeah
A	that's sort of four years they're not working
B	yeah
D	right
A	and
D	yeah
B	well we worked your pension out didn't we? that wouldn't be worth a
D	oh yeah if you had you cos you talked about it last night
A	that's right yeah
D	but if
A	mm mm
D	a pound a week?
A	fifty quid a year
D	yeah fifty-two
A	so you've got a long while yeah so it's a long lot to
D	that's thirteen
A	you've gotta live a lot of years to pay that off haven't you?
D	that's thirteen no it's more than thirteen years isn't it?
B	yeah
D	or is it?
B	yeah
D	well anyway
B	it's not worth it
A	yeah it's not worth it is it? no
B	it's not worth it no
D	that's for that's for one
A	yeah for one pound so
D	one pound a week
A	so so if you want to increase it by twenty quid a week
D	yeah which is what I would
A	you've got to have
B	yeah
A	twenty times whatever it was seven hundred
B	yeah
D	that's crazy
A	that's fourteen thousand
D	I mean no one's going to do that are they?
B	yeah that's bad
D	no one would do that
A	no but this is what they're banking on innit really? I mean some people might do it
D	would they?
B	well some people might if they're healthy and strong and
A	well you look if you got
B	yeah
A	you can get five thousand a year right
B	yeah
A	so five thousand a year is a hundred pound a week
B	yeah
A	from a hundred thousand pound
B	it'd still take twenty
A	a hundred
B	yeah
A	so seven hundred pound for a pound a week seems like a bargain
B	if you got the cash yeah
D	how come?
B	but then you're then you've got
A	well
D	right
A	you can buy an annuity
B	yeah
A	okay?
B	yeah
D	mm
A	so that five thousand a year a year is a hundred pound a week innit?
B	yeah
A	so a hundred thousand pound is paying buying you a hundred pound a week
B	yeah
A	so it's a thousand pound is buying you a pound a week
B	yeah yeah
A	that is the standard rate which
B	but that depends
A	but you see what happened is is that you're paying them seven hundred quid
D	yeah
A	and the government was putting in the extra three hundred quid innit?
B	yeah yeah
A	and you're getting a pound a week but that's taxable
B	yeah
D	I'm getting an extra fifty-two pound a year
A	yeah
D	for putting in
A	seven hundred quid
D	yeah
B	so now she's got
D	you can't
B	fourteen years before she gets the money back
A	well that's right yeah but I mean you look if you're sixty
B	yeah you got
A	well it's you know fourteen years is only seventy-four I mean you're you know if you live to be if you're sixty you're expecting to live to be well over eighty now aren't you?
B	you're right yeah yeah
A	eighty-five so it is a bit of a bargain
B	yeah
A	you know it's it's a
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	I mean you know you get a lot of people who you know they retire and that and what with one thing and other they add up all the cash they got and they got like twenty grand laying about or thirty grand or forty grand or whatever you know
B	yeah
A	but you invest seven hundred quid there's no way you're gonna get fifty-two quid a year interest out of that
B	that's true
A	is there?
B	no
A	cos you're talking about the interest rates of about eight percent
D	I see just sounded ridiculous to me
A	but eight percent I mean nowadays the interest rates you get you know if you put in a building society you're getting one percent if you're lucky
B	yeah if you're lucky yeah it's point something percent now innit?
A	so one percent of seven hundred quid is seven quid a year
D	right
B	yeah
A	but the thing about this increasing you know what you can buy with this increase you know pay to increase your pension thing
B	yeah
A	you can only do it up to a maximum of an extra twenty quid a week is it? or fourteen quid there's some limit on it you can't
B	there is a limit on it yeah
A	yeah cos if cos obviously for a lot of people with a a private pension pot
B	yeah
A	you know they suddenly say oh blooming heck you know if I can get you know
B	yeah that's right that's that's that's
A	well go for it instead of getting five thousand a year
B	that's right look at the
A	you're then getting
B	yeah
A	something like seven or eight thousand
B	yeah
A	but twenty year ten year well ten year fifteen years ago
B	yeah?
A	you know and now it's down to five thousand
B	yeah
A	mm
B	weren't it?
D	mm
B	we were getting fifteen percent
A	that's right I know I know
B	oh right
A	when she was at the traffic lights and she got a whacking great pay out twenty thousand or something like that
B	yeah?
A	and she put it all in the bank she was getting seventeen percent interest on it
B	yeah?
A	and that was a hell of a lot of money
B	that was a lot of money yeah
A	interest
B	how did that get up that high?
D	I mean
B	what?
D	normally that's
A	who are you pointing at?
D	huh?
A	you're sitting there going
B	she just points
D	what I'm just thinking
B	she just points
A	look at that
D	normally if you put
A	yeah
D	put seven hundred into something I've still got my seven hundred won't I?
A	yeah this is the drawback
D	I'm not giving it completely away to get my percent
A	well that's right this is this is what you've got to weigh it up
D	well that just seems to be you're throwing it away
A	well you're not throwing it away cos you've got a guaranteed income
B	for a pound a week
A	you got a guaranteed income cast iron guarantee
D	yeah if if I live
A	fourteen years
B	fourteen years
D	you got you gotta add that seven hundred plus again haven't you?
A	live to be seventy-four
B	yeah
D	I can't see it
B	then you've got to live as long as me that's the point
A	not if she makes you that onion pie
A	mushroom pie
D	seems to me you're just throwing it away
A	I'll just go and get us some mushrooms
B	yeah
A	well it's not throwing it away it it's like you know I mean
B	yeah
A	or it's money you think I'll just have that as an investment long-term investment
B	that's true
A	you see this is the thing it's like
B	well if she's
A	normally normally you wouldn't if it was the only money you'd got
B	yeah
A	I never know now when I might suddenly need you know that money to do something or to do you know but it's the sort of thing that you know if you've already got a rainy day fund and this is more money which is just sitting in the bank
B	yeah but what if what if
A	you know not doing anything
B	would I get that pension money?
A	no
B	no that'd be lost
A	yeah
B	that'd be lost I wouldn't get anything
D	you wouldn't get anything yeah
B	that's hardly fair
D	surely it'd be better for me to invest it into something isn't it?
B	she would wouldn't she?
A	as a widow's pension
D	if I invested it into something
A	yeah but I mean like you could say you could say
B	yeah
A	cos they're likely to increase in value
B	yeah
A	you know this sort of thing whenever you buy anything it's always expensive but when you sell it it's always bloody cheap innit?
B	yes yes
A	you know and
B	plus you have to pay a fee don't you?
D	mm mm
A	well it's like all this stuff whatever you whatever you invest it in I mean
B	yeah
A	I mean I got
B	yeah
A	in a tin you know
B	yeah
A	and you think cor I should really put that in the bank you know I could get one percent interest and every year I'd be ten pound better off
B	yeah but you would also be lose you'd be worse off as well because of the inflation rate
A	and then you think no
B	I mean the inflation rate is more than the interest rate
A	well that's right but that's chewing away at the value of the money I got at home anyway
B	you got anyway yeah
A	and you sort of think well
B	well that's right
A	and it's the same I got stuff at home which you know I got a blooming
B	yeah
A	and a Triumph Spitfire car sitting in the garage
B	you have haven't you?
A	slowly decaying into the ground
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you see
D	yeah
B	the whole point is between the difference between me and
A	well exactly
B	we just can't we can't be like these greedy entrepreneurs that that would that would kill their grandmother for for the
A	but also
B	yeah
A	I mean the thing is is that
B	yeah
A	set down haven't you?
B	yeah we have
A	if the worst come to the worst you could trade down
B	yeah
A	I mean it would be a lot of work and effort
B	it would be
A	but
B	yeah
A	just cash sitting there better than in the bank innit?
B	well it's yeah
D	mm
B	we have thought about it haven't we? we have thought about flogging the house
A	mm
B	but then we think
A	well exactly it's the same with my house you see
B	all the work and sorting everything out
A	and also
B	that's up to the kids when we're gone
A	yeah
D	ah
B	we had to sort our parents' houses out didn't we?
D	yeah
A	but then you sort of look at
B	it's all gone yeah she's in the
A	you know she sort of got you know probably about forty grand left
B	yeah
A	out of a house which was worth you know a hundred and eighty
B	yeah
D	mm
A	and er
B	where that's gone? what happened there?
A	yeah
B	you can yeah
A	you see
B	we have thought about that as well
A	so if you're ever if you're ever got short of money
B	yeah
A	you know I mean the thing is they used to say that was a bit dodgy cos there's a lot of dodgy firms and that but
B	it was yeah
A	but it's now sorted out now that it's actually a bona fide establishment
B	yeah yeah
A	sort of running it
D	mm
A	and you could probably borrow get a hundred thousand cash out of this house
B	yeah
A	no sweat and you never have to pay it back
B	no
A	because they they just take it when you die
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	and it's not when one of you dies when both of you die
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	you know and it just like builds up over the years obviously but then you sort of think well the value of the house builds up as well
B	yes it does don't it? yeah
A	slowly but surely
D	mm
B	but then a hundred thousand quid what would we do with a hundred thousand quid?
D	yeah but you see we're we're so bad at spending anyway
B	yeah
D	you know we really struggle to erm go out for a meal or anything like
A	yeah yeah but I mean
D	and that's normal for other people
A	yeah but it's not something to sort of like consider as a negative thing
B	no
A	it's a thing
D	no
A	yeah so you I mean alright you know I mean I just get I'm living on pension credit I can save up money
B	yeah
A	you know quite a lot of money that you know that
B	yeah
A	cos I just don't spend it I don't need it you know
B	well I doubt whether we spend all our pension do we?
D	mm no
B	yeah because you haven't been spending
A	yeah I know
D	a bit more than normal
A	you know I get mine paid in every week
D	we've cashed in our ISAs and
A	yeah
D	and Premium Bonds and that I mean we're cashing them in
A	you know I I get pension credit so I'm not allowed to have more than a certain amount of cash right?
B	no that's right sixteen thousand innit?
A	something like that yeah
B	yeah
A	and er and I'm sort of you know don't really want to have to look at how much money I got
B	no
D	no
B	yeah
A	and I first I sort of started thinking well I gotta keep my
B	yeah
A	you know so I don't have to worry about if I wanna you know do anything
B	yeah
A	but now I have trouble keeping it below three thousand quid
B	yeah
A	you know and that includes you know I've given
B	yeah
A	then cos it's just that I don't spend it all
D	yeah
B	well that's
A	and like I don't run a car you know?
D	no point in spending it just for the sake of spending it
A	well exactly you know and I can't go out drinking cos I'm not allowed to
D	no
B	no
A	and I don't really
D	no
A	so
B	yeah
A	and I always give her like you know a couple of hundred quid towards the you know toward the travel and stuff
B	yeah
A	and er I'd rather sort of do that than go
B	yeah I have to say we we can't we can't spend money can we
D	no
B	we can't spend money because we think
A	that's right cos I used to sort of you know like my my mum and my ancient aunt who lived in
B	no
A	you're not
B	so did we with
A	and she refused to buy it you know she'd say oh I don't need to that
D	yeah I used to say it to my parents
A	and this aunt this aunt of mine she lived like a church mouse
D	mm
B	yeah
A	you know you'd go in the kitchen there was nothing no food ever there you know and I couldn't understand that but I do that I go out gives you an excuse to walk down to town
B	to buy some
A	and buy a bit of stuff you know
B	yeah
A	and er she sort of like always worried about money and stuff like that and
B	oh crikey
A	which she'd been you know and they and a lot of them had elapsed
B	yeah
A	cos she hadn't bothered she couldn't be bothered to pay it
D	really?
A	yeah
D	oh dear
A	she was getting erm housing benefit giros
D	yeah
A	you know and she had a pension paid pension book and then she was getting housing benefit giros
B	yeah
D	mm
A	and she had this bloody drawer full of them
A	with things like winter fuel payments and stuff they used to send you a giro
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	and like half of them were
B	oh yeah it used to be giros yeah
A	they used to run out after three months
B	yeah
A	and half these bloody giros had all ran out
B	yeah
A	she was a bit sort of erm you know Alzheimer-ish
B	well it's a good job they pay it straight into her bank account now innit really?
A	well she's dead now but
B	yeah but they do don't they?
A	yeah that's right that's right
D	yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	you know I'll take them when I go to
A	you forget
B	so I'm glad we don't get giros
D	yeah
A	but I mean she never
D	yeah
A	sitting in a kitchen used to live in the kitchen
B	yeah
A	and that was only like half the size of this room her kitchen was
B	yeah
A	she had a little table there and a little brown teapot
B	oh it's a shame innit?
A	and a one-bar electric fire and then she hardly ever had that on cos I used to go and visit her and she said oh
B	cos you were there yeah
B	well I must say my mum
A	yeah?
B	it was so hot weren't it
D	it was hot in her house yeah
A	mm
B	she she used to that used to be really really hot didn't it?
D	mm
B	you couldn't if you got up and done anything it would make you sweat
A	so what was that electric heating?
B	no she had er
A	oh right yeah
B	oil fires
A	so that's cost her a bit then?
B	and they used to
A	what red diesel?
B	red diesel
A	yeah
B	because my dad had this firm
A	mm mm that he used to get he used to get the red diesel from you know and fill ours up as well
A	yeah
B	and I'll tell you what I'll tell you how much it
A	mm mm
B	it was one and six a gallon
A	I could never emember which sort of crisis that was that was the Israeli war weren't it?
B	that was the Israeli war that went up from one and six to
A	mm
B	erm yeah
A	but old people like where
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	you go in there and you just break out into a sweat
B	yeah
A	you know cos they keep it so warm
B	yeah
A	I dunno why
D	well the residents are quite cold aren't they? because they're just sitting around
A	well I suppose so yeah
B	well you see they sit they sit sit around all day their legs get cold they cover up
D	they don't even have to get up
B	I mean we sit here in a with a blanket over our legs at night
A	yeah
B	we do
A	yeah
B	don't we?
D	we do
A	well that's right I mean I got a fleece on you got a fleece on
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	quite often I've got a hat on as well
D	I've got
D	yeah
A	oh and the other day
D	oh really?
B	yeah
D	oh
A	cos I've got my heating right and at night
B	yeah
A	where the front door is
B	yeah
A	and its got a new radiator in there and it's like an ice box
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	which is not very warm is it?
D	no
B	no
A	but because the this particular night outside temperature was like minus five or something it'd
A	so the central heating boiler was running alright
B	oh crikey yeah
B	yeah I know what you mean though
A	yeah so on and off and there's no heat actually leaks into that
B	we've had the heating on yesterday didn't we?
D	we have
B	well it ain't working
D	well cos that's not hot enough is it?
B	no
A	well
D	no we turn it we turn it off at night
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it just comes on if it's particularly cold
B	yeah
D	yes so your heating's on but it's not because it's
A	but I have I have my fire
B	mm?
A	I have my fire going all the time
B	yeah we have that fire going that's not
A	I've discovered this trick with my fire
B	yeah
A	and I'll shut it right down
B	yeah
A	without anything on it at all
A	yeah
B	so that'll keep it on all night and we have banked it up when we go out
A	mm
B	have banked it up to keep the heat in but that's that's always out seven days later but I mean that's kept the
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and there's just a couple of little blows in there and you know you can sort of carefully balance a few you know you don't want to lump them a load of stuff
B	no
A	but balance a bit on it and let the draft in and it'll pick up again a few more
B	and then you're away
A	then you're away
B	that's the same with that one I mean we've always got that down low I mean it's not
A	mm mm it's alright
B	it's okay
A	it's alright
B	it's always down low and er that'll heat the water up the main thing
A	mm mm
B	but when it gets so hot when the water gets so hot that'll switch the heating on
A	mm
B	which er drains that or drains it down and
A	mm mm
B	that's why that ain't on now
A	yeah
B	but er what with that fire in there
A	mm
B	and this fire here well we're just comfortable more more or less all the time
A	yeah cos this is the thing you see I was going to say is that this particular day when everything was so hot just don't feel comfortable I felt like
B	no that's right
A	you know I don't want to do anything you know and you think
B	and when when it's too hot in the house that's it innit?
A	yeah
B	oh god can't stand it can't stand it
A	no
B	I mean I I I don't know what it is at the moment I'll tell you what it is at the moment in here
A	what's that in centigrade?
B	oh just on just on twenty
A	a lot of people have their houses at twenty-two don't they?
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	if you were working you wouldn't need any heat in your house at all would you?
B	no wouldn't no
A	you know
B	no you wouldn't
A	cos you'd be warm yourself
B	that's right  I mean if we ever do housework
A	mm
A	I know yeah yeah course yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	occasionally when I hoover up you know I sort of
B	yeah you think oh god
A	yeah
A	no?
B	no you'd think it would wouldn't you?
A	yeah yeah
B	it hasn't freeze frozen since we've been here
A	when I lived down
B	did it?
A	it started
B	oh dear a friend of ours up the road there
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	the pipes burst and
A	all burst yeah they would do
B	and flooded the house out
A	but
B	and
A	a modern house?
B	well I suppose it was built in the built I'll tell you who it was built by
A	but yeah but that can't have had any insulation
B	no insulation at all no
A	in the roof and stuff like that
B	that was
D	yeah
B	in the yeah
A	I reckon my house
B	no no
A	cos you know that really holds the heat well
D	well lagged
B	yeah
A	sorry?
D	because it's really well lagged
A	that's right yeah
D	yeah yeah
B	because you the walls got done didn't they?
A	the
B	yeah yeah
A	just like everything seems to like hold the heat you know?
B	and his upstairs we've put our stuff down you know?
D	yeah we have haven't we?
B	his was that thick
A	it's more than that
B	is it
A	it was erm
D	really
B	that go all up over the joists then don't it?
A	no I got the joists are packed to that depth
B	yeah
A	so then on top of that there's about that depth
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	so there's a there's about a foot on top of the joists
B	yeah
D	mm
B	we got a load of load of stuff to put up there
A	mm
B	we were going to put it up there weren't we?
D	yeah well I think we're still that is the plan isn't it?
B	yeah that is the plan to put it up there
A	yeah
D	we bought the wrong sort
B	yeah we did
A	why is that? what was wrong with it?
D	oh we we bought some big stuff
A	yeah
D	it's that's got no lagging in at all it's got no insulation at all
B	yeah yeah
D	and we needed to go in between the rafters
A	uhu
D	mm
B	first but this one will go that's that's something silver
A	well it's it's what?
B	that's in silver
A	oh right so the special stuff?
B	yeah
A	well we don't need so much of that then?
B	no
D	but really it needs to go in inside first doesn't it?
B	it needs to go inside it
A	yeah but it is you can buy
B	you can yeah
A	a four inch in
B	yeah
A	small rolls and build a frame with joists
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	yeah we're gonna have to that's that's one thing we're
B	we're gonna have to do something about that
B	look at that budgie he keeps
D	cos the plan the plan was you see cleared that out about two years ago now
D	thinking ahead
D	and we got the stuff I know that
B	we bought the stuff in B and Q
D	and er
B	cos they have they have er
D	the idea is to do that
B	special offers sometimes yeah
D	move and sort out this loft
A	er
D	get rid of the boxes that we don't need put the others in there
B	yeah
D	and all the stuff in there and then do this one cos this needs clear you know that was the plan
A	yeah so you'll have to you have to erm
B	yeah yeah
D	the big plan
B	got to line out the joists first
A	so well no you put the flooring stuff down first then line the joists
B	yeah
A	you know with a boarding
D	mm
B	yeah
A	and then put another foot down
B	cor yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	big plan
B	yeah I can't see us doing
D	we have these ideas and then we can't be bothered to do it can we?
A	yeah what you need to do
A	hire a skip sort out the loft
B	yeah we do
A	into the skip straight into the skip it's all valuable stuff up there though innit? there is
D	I well I think most of it will go
A	when when we were
D	I've I've no doubt about that really
A	what sort of stuff you got in the loft?
D	well only
A	mm
D	there's not there's not a lot up there
A	have you got big access to it then?
D	I did keep like paperwork up
B	no it's not very big access it's only about that big
A	well that's reasonably big then
B	is it?
A	yeah well mine is only
D	mm
B	is it? oh right
A	just enough to get a man up
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	we'll see yeah well I I that is an awkward loft though innit?
A	mm
D	it is a bit
B	it's right at the top of the stairs
D	it was further up it was above our bedroom wasn't it?
B	yeah it was above our bedroom yeah
D	we changed it over
B	yeah but you see that's that's a very awkward see this this room here goes the other way the house is like that you see and that goes that way like that
A	yeah yeah
B	so the loft is there and you go up that loft and you walk across and you can you either way or that way you see
D	yeah the water tank's in the way and things isn't it?
B	the water tank's in the way there's
A	have you got like cross bracing there across the?
B	yeah and you've got to to step over it
B	yeah
A	see mine
B	yeah yours in a big open space is it?
A	it's
B	yeah
A	it's complete just open all the way all the length of the house
B	yeah it's beautiful innit?
D	lovely
B	it's beautiful you've got no
D	I wish we'd have got
A	you could put another you could put another erm couple of rooms up there
B	put another room
A	you could yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	I expect this is what
B	yeah yeah big house like that?
A	well
B	yeah
A	like the neighbours are there and their house is there so you've got a massive great roof
B	wow
A	like over two houses
B	yeah?
A	and in London a bedroom is worth a hundred thousand on the price of your house
B	it is isn't it? yeah
D	yeah
A	and they work out when the
B	that's right
A	so they could double the money
B	yeah
A	by having a loft conversion done
D	yeah they're doing it are they?
A	well they keep talking about it and
B	yeah
D	mm
B	it depends how much tax his grandad has got to pay
A	well yeah
B	and the
A	he's Jewish so you know they'll have that all sorted
B	they'll have that sorted won't they? yeah
A	but he his grandfather he lived in this
B	are they? oh right
A	they're not going to sell that
B	no what about death dues and all that?
A	god knows
B	I mean some of these er
A	mm
B	they had to sell all the paintings and stuff like that to pay the death dues
A	yeah well that's right yeah
B	or even give it to the National Trust which is one way out of it as as long as
A	yeah
B	as long as as long as the family lived here
A	yeah but you can keep the painting
B	yeah
A	that's like like at
B	yeah
A	you know get death duties of five million oh we'll give this painting on the understanding we can keep it
B	yeah
A	that's like we'll transfer the ownership to the government
B	yeah
A	that's a handy relationship innit?
B	that is innit? yeah
D	mm
B	yeah
A	so it means the next person who dies is that's not counted in the
B	no
A	you know in how much they're worth
B	no
A	you know cos they've still got the picture
B	they've still got the picture yeah insured by the government
A	it makes you sick don't it? dunnit? yeah
B	yeah
A	and they've got this thing whereby they have to
B	yeah
A	but these registers they're on are so obscure that you nobody ever finds it you know?
A	if they want to have a look at a painting they just say that's tough luck and then if you do find it you can phone them up saying I wanna look at the painting and they say well I I'll arrange a time when it's convenient
B	yeah probably yeah
A	or something like that you know?
B	yeah
A	but there's a whole register isn't there? in London
B	yeah
A	and you know you could actually you know find out about it
B	find out about it yeah
A	go and look at it
B	yeah
B	with the land registry
A	ain't they never been registered?
B	no
A	I bet that cost you a few bob as well didn't it?
B	two hundred quid weren't it?
D	yeah it did
A	yeah
B	two hundred quid to
D	solicitors
A	that's what
B	yeah
D	oh yeah
A	but mine got registered when I bought it you see?
B	yeah yeah
A	cos normally when they change over change hands but if they never changed hands
B	no oh I see yeah
D	next door have to do it as well didn't they?
B	yeah they had to do theirs
A	yeah well that's the same thing like they never
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the land weren't registered anyway
A	mm
B	so we'd put the house on it or we'd put the dairy on first and the
D	they don't show the dairy
B	they don't show the dairy
A	mm
D	how silly is that?
A	is that on the deeds?
B	yeah
D	so I actually said to the solicitor you know they wanted paying they I said well they haven't they haven't put all the buildings on they haven't put the cowshed on anything but I mean that's new that doesn't matter
B	they ain't put the cowshed
A	yeah
D	but the dairy was there first that was
B	the dairy was first that ain't on
D	so
A	well perhaps it's not on the deeds then?
B	it should be shouldn't it?
D	well not on the deeds for the land no
B	no
D	we haven't got land deeds
A	you haven't got land deeds?
D	that's all we've got
A	what? just the land deeds? and they've never been altered to show the buildings and so on?
D	yeah
B	no
D	no
A	well they should have been
B	they should have been yeah
D	but but now we've got
A	but this is what they're talking about that's why you need the land registry you see
B	yeah
D	now we've got the land registry yeah they've put on little it's it's only a little piece of paper A4
A	yeah and they just draw a little sketch on it
D	and just tiny little buildings
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	but they haven't got that one
B	and they still didn't put it on
D	and I said to him shouldn't they have all the buildings? and he said no don't need that whatever they say
B	yeah
D	and you got you've just got to take their word for it haven't you?
A	yeah solicitors yeah
B	yeah solicitors for you he didn't give two monkeys
A	no course they don't
B	yeah
D	ah
B	yeah
A	and when
B	yeah
A	it's costing them a thousand pounds
B	is it?
A	mm
B	oh
A	yeah
B	no of course they're not
A	you know they've got all the
B	yeah
A	and then they just keep sending them out oh sign this with a you know get a witness sign this one
B	yeah
A	oh right send them back again and I'll send that do you agree that this is fair? yes send it back again do you agree this is fair? send it back it's just paper pushing
B	yeah
A	a thousand pounds
B	and and then that's about forty pound a letter I think nowadays
A	this lot were thinking of doing with their erm
B	oh right yeah
A	and er first of all they sent me a letter saying oh let us know if you've got a television or not
B	why should you?
A	why should I? so I ignored that then they sent a letter oh you are now on the investigation register
B	yeah
A	and I I I very seriously thought about
B	no they don't no
A	I seriously thought about writing to them
A	and including an invoice
B	a hundred quid
A	a hundred quid
B	yeah
A	it says you know like invoice for providing
B	information
A	information
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and er and then saying erm
B	otherwise ten percent will be
A	you know ten percent will be added you know after forty-eight days it will be er pursued by the er small claims court
B	yeah
A	cos you think why the hell should I?
B	I wonder what'd happen?
A	what?
B	I wonder what would happen?
A	I don't know
B	cos
A	I bet they won't send you a hundred quid
B	well
A	that's capita you see
D	mm mm
B	there was there was a there was a case similar to that
A	was there?
B	yes there was and they had to pay them
A	oh really?
B	yeah I think if you look it up on the net you'll find that er there's he sent a letter cos they kept sending him letters
A	mm
B	and charging him thirty quid a time and he sent letters back and said how much you know just like you know
A	mm
B	yeah
A	cos I can't see why I should
B	no no why should you pay fifty pence for a stamp?
A	mm mm to tell them you haven't got a television
A	yeah or even spend the time or effort
B	or spend the time writing it
A	or brainpower doing it I mean I you know fishing licence you know I have a van licence
B	no
A	a fire arms licence
B	that's right they don't come round and see
A	a sailing boat licence
B	yeah
A	you don't have to like write and tell them you haven't got one
B	no you don't do you?
A	you know? or even like you know any licence you know like
A	yeah
B	asking him er to write back to them telling them
A	no you wouldn't
B	if if they wanted they can come and investigate knock on your door
A	cos the other the thing is now that you can watch live television on your computer can't you?
B	yeah I suppose you can yeah
A	if you stick a card in a TV card in
B	yeah
A	and also on top of that the BBC are actually showing live stuff streamed online
B	they are aren't they yeah?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and if you've got a computer you can watch play back
B	you can
A	but you aren't allowed to watch live TV
B	no you're not no
A	and er
B	oh I see yeah
A	you know they don't say anything about
B	recorded TV
A	recorded programmes
B	no
