C	it doesn't matter does it?
A	yeah
B	help yourself to fruit well the bananas are looking a bit rank now aren't they?
A	yeah the pears
B	and the pears
A	it's all looking a little bit ropey
B	it is actually that's because you took them all out of the fridge the pears
A	no they were already a bit bruised yeah but they were hidden in the fridge no-one was gonna eat them
B	dad eats them he gets fruit and he keeps his but I don't eat much fruit to be honest
A	well that's selfish
B	apart from the bananas
C	he does he's quite good isn't he
B	he's always eating fruit but he he always keeps it in the fridge he prefers it
A	well I take it out

C	yeah
B	is it? we've got a small Aldi at Aldi? Aldi in erm

B	in Germany
A	with my
B	with a suitcase?
A	cos I worked out
B	didn't you feel silly taking your shopping off the thing and putting it in the suitcase?

A	has she had
B	no
A	oh
C	I must admit
B	mm well to be honest
C	because if you start lying to one person
B	well I wouldn't have lied
C	you have to
B	mm
C	or not lied that's the wrong word not telling the
B	yeah
C	whole
B	well I just wouldn't have mentioned it and then if she'd found out we could have said oh yeah you know well
A	yeah
B	a five year old who's going to

B	she tried to
A	yeah yeah she is
B	and she flipped on Christmas day they picked
C	mm
B	because
A	yeah she was
B	they lived in
C	oh right
B	so they picked them both up
A	get stuff
B	get all you know the the dog and all her gear cos they were staying for a couple of nights and erm
A	yeah you never text you know like never to text now
A	yeah
B	and said
C	what time did you come in in the
B	yeah yeah so
C	and what time did he send that?
B	about midday
A	yeah cos we were already at the flat at that time
B	yeah
A	cos you
C	what time did you land?
A	I landed at ten
C	in the morning?
A	yeah
C	and what time did the daughter land nine?
A	well she landed at nine but she took so long to get through customs that she actually came out just before me so it worked out perfectly
B	yeah cos she's not
A	anyway
B	she I mean you said the
A	yeah
C	oh so
B	yeah
C	she had to go through oh right
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	they did stop me actually they said excuse me do you have any erm alcohol in that bag? and I said cos I had all those things presents didn't I?
B	oh yeah?
A	I said oh yeah I have a little bit
A	they obviously couldn't be bothered that day
C	cos I must admit you when you go through and you think oh I've got two hundred I've got
A	yeah I'm always yeah
C	twenty fags too many
B	yeah
C	cos you've got
B	yeah
C	a packet
B	mm
C	and there's nobody there
B	yeah
C	don't they? and they know what flights
B	anyway so so
A	yes
B	the rest of the story
C	and was she in a good mood?
A	she was in a really good mood and really happy we'd done all our stockings and everything and we erm yeah so everyone was in a good mood a nice mood and then
A	and she like
A	and she hadn't seen her for six months as well had she?
B	no
A	and she like screaming at
C	what and
A	yeah
B	well he asked what time to wake me up
A	but she didn't even listen to what
B	so I'd be up and all ready by the time they got here you know
A	but
C	you shouldn't what?
A	eat starch cos she'd been eating crisps beforehand
B	yeah she was quite
A	and then she flipped into into happy jolly mode again and we had
A	a happy jolly journey back
C	oh
A	it was all dad's fault we had a very uncomfortable
A	I was just sitting there while she was screaming at
C	well what does
B	he
A	he doesn't
B	he doesn't he just tries to placate her well er that's why
C	she don't like he does she?
B	no they're not really
C	I mean the trouble is that they're
B	I I'm sure she's slightly bipolar
A	this was a few years ago wasn't it
B	years ago it was after dad died I think it was the first Christmas the
A	so
B	yeah
A	cos he was only a baby
B	they went out
C	his family and his wife
B	you know his family upstairs and and
B	just sat on the porch with her suitcase
C	oh they went to Canada?
B	yeah this was in Canada
C	oh sorry I thought you meant France
B	yeah and erm they couldn't you know
C	does your mum get your mum gets on with her though doesn't she?
B	yeah
C	you wouldn't see them would you?
B	it would drive a wedge between
C	how did he meet her?
B	through work
C	in Canada or
B	he was working in Canada on something some and he met her there
C	never forgiven her for what? for like
B	well oh for that and
C	to be treated like that
B	and also on one occasion
A	used the wrong dishcloth or something
B	used the wrong
A	I don't know
B	utensil or kitchen utensil for something or other and
C	over a dishcloth?
B	oh it was something that
A	really small yeah
B	it was something in the kitchen
B	be civil to
C	mm
B	after that cos she said I never ever got an apology she said I did get an email erm
C	what are you looking for love?
B	about a year later
E	glasses
B	which referred to that Christmas and it wasn't an apology but it was and she thought well that's the best I'm gonna get
C	but the trouble is is
C	yeah because they
B	mm
C	like it's fun and upbeat if she's
B	mm yeah
C	in the right mood
B	but that's that that Christmassy thing and that thing where she just
A	yes she does she flips
B	you can't be slightly bipolar you're either bipolar
A	she flips
B	or you're not aren't you but
C	the trouble is
B	yeah
C	you've gotta remember alright she speaks English and everything but she comes from a different she comes from Canada
B	mm
C	they have different ideas they're
B	yeah
C	all very I don't know
B	yeah
C	their
B	yeah but surely all Canadians aren't crazy like that
C	no then most I mean she most probably has got some sort of
C	yeah
B	mm
C	cos like erm I didn't realise
B	mm
C	before he met
B	yeah
C	and erm she had a
B	oh right
C	mm I never knew this child existed and apparently he lives in erm
B	mm
C	and er he contacted
B	right
C	and he said I don't suppose you're my dad are you?
B	oh
C	he was born in
B	oh
C	erm his dad again and erm and it was
B	mm
C	so
C	and whatever
B	mm
C	and
B	mm
C	with loads of information just tell him that
B	mm
C	what you've done just a little résumé of your life and if you wanna know anything and apparently his first wife died
B	oh
C	and er
B	right
C	well
B	mm
C	and you can stay with us
B	yeah
C	and because he never made a thing of it
B	mm
C	that they presume that you're gonna invite them to stay they presume
B	mm
C	that you're
B	well what do mean though cos he didn't make a great big thing of it? cos he didn't say oh thank you very much and or or
A	oh my goodness
B	and all that?
C	yeah
B	oh
C	so he's not bothered with him anymore
B	he sounds like a complete dick
C	well he is sometimes
B	mm
C	he can be
B	yeah mm
A	has everyone had breakfast?
B	no I'm waiting for your dad I'm gonna start cooking in a minute

B	never ever
A	but it's in my pot that I have to smash
B	yeah

A	well for Christmas I got you know these Italian style pots that you get and you have to smash
C	oh and you have to smash it like
A	them open on the floor?

A	and mum gets really annoyed
C	how much is in there do you know?
A	I don't know I've been doing it since Christmas just as and when putting a few pounds in probably haven't got that much in it yet probably it's gonna take me a few years to
C	they do hold quite cos they've got like a
B	yeah with all the
B	no I reckon if you fill it only with two pound coins when it's full it'll be a thousand pounds
C	two pound coins?
B	mm
C	you see I don't get many two pound coins really
B	my friend
A	no
B	she's always buying my two pound coins she puts them all in one of those
C	yeah
B	and she's always she buys two pound coins off people if I've got any she goes oh
A	I'll just I
C	we collect twenty Ps in that little chicken on the windowsill in the kitchen and every time there's ten pound in it we bag that up
A	yeah but it's
C	and erm when we went to er
A	okay same as me
B	and he
A	why?
B	I don't know
A	well I went for it and they refused me cos I
C	why?

C	oh right yeah
A	yeah
C	well he won't for whatever reason
B	yeah
C	he got made redundant erm he's got a couple of little pensions but he won't go down and sign on because he doesn't
A	okay
C	he's got high blood pressure he gets very very stressed and to sit in a job interview would just make him
A	so he'd never get a job then? if he can't sit in a
C	he most probably wouldn't
A	yeah
C	because he's really nervous and agitated plus
A	what is she a nurse?
C	auxiliary
A	what's auxiliary?
C	just like a carer
A	okay
C	unqualified so she gets quite good money cos it's time and thirty a time and sixty percent for the weekend

C	and er and I said oh
A	oh my god
C	and he kept coming went now

C	and he went here you are there's them here's your
A	yeah
C	here's your twenty Ps give us two quid's worth he give us two quid's worth and he's just putting it in his pocket and I was thinking hold on a minute that's my friend's money

A	but that's for your holiday

B	that is
A	oh okay
B	moneybox holiday fund

B	no but it's full of twenty Ps and
A	we need to
B	swapping all the twenty Ps
B	right see you in a minute
A	yes if I have change in my purse I'll just spend it on something so that's why I always just come home and just put it straight in there
