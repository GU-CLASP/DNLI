A	does it make sense to say eight percent dispersion of product X and product Y?
B	what?
A	erm it's in it's like science
B	yeah
A	and
B	dispersion yeah I think erm
A	cos it sounds good to me like that's how I would've translated it it's like eight percent dispersion of product X in product Y
B	dispersion yeah cos that dispersion means erm to move or mix doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	I'm just going to just google the definition and then I might be able to
A	she's erm going to
B	the action and process of
A	physics
B	the separation of white light into colours or of any radiation according to wavelength
A	yeah so like the separation of things into something else? yeah
B	yeah that sounds right yeah
A	I'm just reading this really funny article that completely relates to me so it's erm twelve secrets skinny fat people have think of a twig rolled in gak but cute
A	so basically skinny fat is a woefully under-representeted eh under-represented body type it describes a body that appears relatively slender but that is not toned and is in fact quite squishy and those of us that have this body type harvest several secrets number one we're totally aware that
A	let the rolls roll free so you don't have to tell us number two yes we're going to eat that and you don't have to ask us where we store it because we both know the answer everywhere
A	three not all
A	number five then again some of us aren't because ultimately being thin doesn't necessarily mean being mean someone is healthy number six some skinny people have double chins as well as a
A	seven and sometimes there's no avoiding a muffin top they're the new cronut
A	eight good posture can do a lot it's like stretching out a roll of cookie dough
A	look at the photo
B	look it's moving
A	aw
B	just don't think it can fly
A	little thing
B	fly little one fly
B	oh I were watching this it were funny
B	I think with
A	yeah
B	maybe that's what it is
A	aw
B	aw I wish she'd stop calling me fucking
A	oh
B	you jealous of my T-shirt?
A	I have a Paramore T-shirt
B	did you get it from a concert though?
A	nope
A	cos erm what use what we use to do is like a dynamic duo
B	mm
A	erm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm I used to always get flights over to
B	mm
A	to the concerts and we went to Bullet for My Valentine
B	yeah
A	that was awful because there was like no age restriction so like there were really really young kids there and that's how we were able to go cos we were still like obviously
B	yeah
A	like thirteen and erm
A	he was like when the beat drops next time I want you all to crash into each other and everyone was like yeah so we were just standing on the edges watching everyone run and mosh into each other we were like I don't like this
A	I want to go home
A	and he took us to Linkin Park and Jay Z and Fall Out Boy and then he got me a ticket to go to Paramore but I couldn't go
B	why couldn't you go?
A	I think cos it was during my school period I had exams or something
B	mm
A	so my mam said no
B	bitch
A	so he gave his ticket to someone else
A	and he fucking met Paramore there as well
B	he met them?
A	yeah at the time he was doing photography and stuff and he was like I think shadowing another photographer
B	yeah
A	who was there so like they all got to go backstage and meet them and say hello
B	oh my god
A	I know I've never forgiven my mam for that was like one exam for that
B	oh come on butterfly fly away see it moved its wings then I think it's broken that leg or something cos it's just dragging it
A	yeah it does seem to be dragging it's going to fall seems to like you though he's ah I'm happy here now
A	aw he must be terrified he's probably like humans that saved me don't leave me
A	aw
B	I want to look at his wing it's really damaged but I don't know if it were like that before cos
A	well that wing there at the bottom's ripped and it's not on the other side
B	mm
A	and that's one's a bit ripped as well but like sometimes butterflies can be fine with a ripped wing
B	mm
A	like I've seen other ones with ripped wings flying around and stuff but maybe it touched a nerve or something
B	yeah
A	I just don't understand the anatomy of butterflies
B	they're so tiny aren't they? like can you imagine having like
A	yeah
B	so weird aren't they?
A	mm are you going to give give
B	yeah I'm going to Facetime her later yeah
A	ah she said thanks for getting back to me anyway hun just let me know if she needs anything I'm glad you're with her
B	ah
A	and of course she's going to ring you later
A	I'm going to like make my own version oh I just put my hand back in a bogey I just wiped on a chair
B	ah you're so attractive
A	look
B	er
B	yeah she probably felt sick that's probably why she did it long time for a wash
A	I always thought that but it's because it's that kind of washing machine I don't know like it's she always does it on that one I've asked her about before but she always puts it on that cycle
B	I put them
A	yeah
B	bloody flies go away do you want a cigarette
B	have those flies actually got teeth then or what?
A	no I don't think so
B	how do they bite you?
A	I don't know maybe with pincers
B	oh yeah never thought of that
A	never looked into that
B	Google solves all of life's questions
A	mm I've got to google about the Union Jack as well
B	yeah
A	yeah they do sometimes they start earlier so help you if you're awake
A	mm
B	but I don't really know what a Jack flag is
A	mm it is commonly referred to as the Union Jack but Union Flag is actually the correct form as it only becomes a Jack when flown from the ship's Jack mast
B	oh right well there you go then mystery solved
B	thank you Google
A	right what was the other mystery?
B	I don't remember
A	no why you do this?
B	what on earth are you doing?
B	so we're going to go into
A	mm hm
B	get some sunglasses
A	mm hm
B	and then what? come back and chill by the pool? do the
A	mm hm yeah dad said we didn't have to do it today
B	cos if we do that tomorrow morning like get up at a similar time do it tomorrow morning and then we've got the rest of the day
A	yeah
B	and your dad's still happy cos we done what he wanted us to do
A	erm
B	mm
A	so I'd rather just stay in one place if possible
B	yeah er why don't you invest in a pair of Ray-Bans?
A	I would but I'm perfectly happy like with some cheap stuff
B	yeah
A	cos then at least I'll know that I don't have to worry about losing them or breaking or damaging them
B	worry about them mm
A	cos I don't really like having very expensive nice things cos I'm always scared I'm going to ruin them and then I end up not using them because I don't want to ruin them and that defeats the point of getting them
B	yeah well I've lost mine already or thought I'd lost them
B	it's like I had
A	case in point
B	yeah when I had
A	mm
B	they're mine you know? I was still gutted when I thought I'd lost them but then I thought well they're a pair of sunglasses like
A	mm
B	yeah I've spent a lot of money of them but it doesn't matter they're a pair of sunglasses you know it's not like it's a sentimental
A	but that's what's I mean for me it's like there's no point in me investing so much because they are just a pair of sunglasses
B	yeah
A	and I only use them in the summer
B	mm I love my Ray-Bans though cos I don't often spend a lot of money on myself like clothes and stuff like that I'll go to Primark or New Look or somewhere cheap
A	mm
B	I never go to like Top Shop except for my jeans but I only buy a pair of jeans every six months so like I
A	yeah
B	fuck it
A	fair enough that was part of your holiday money part of your treat
B	yeah
A	cos at the moment I've managed to save up quite a bit this summer I don't know how some miracle erm but every penny of it now is I might go out for another meal or another few drinks when I say goodbye to my friends and stuff but I I don't want to spend any more than fifty euros now
B	you might have to
A	because that's going to be money I'm going to be living off once I pay my rent
B	well I've got an idea obviously you've got your savings off your grandad which you don't want to dip into except for driving lessons and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	erm obviously next summer you'll be doing internships won't you? so it might be worth using that money next summer because you'll not be able to work
B	and I don't know if interns pay you
A	I was thinking of using that money I'm going to look into that three-week
B	yeah
A	erm obviously if I can do that then I'm going to put my grandad's savings towards it
B	mm hm
A	because they say that like it's unpaid but it's three weeks so I just need three weeks' worth of living costs but they said that they put you up
B	oh so you get your accommodation?
A	yeah so it's just living fees like obviously food travel paying for flights there and back
B	yeah
A	but obviously I mean if I do get onto the internship like now I can book the flights so far in advance that there won't be a problem
B	yeah it depends on what date you go though
A	yeah well I'll have a look and then I was speaking to my dad and I asked him as a joke completely at first I was like when are you going to hook me up with an internship in your company? cos we were talking about I don't know if you were yeah I think you were there actually I don't know
B	yeah I were there yeah
A	just like just like the rich lifestyle and all that like I don't agree with any of the ethics of working there as an internship
B	no but you can work there for a few years make a lot of money and then leave
A	exactly and then I can actually have money to go into the stuff that I want like if it's voluntary work obviously it's unpaid
B	yeah yeah
A	and as a complete joke he was
A	and he literally said it like so matter of factly
B	he said something about the UN as well
A	and I was just like why why the fuck did you not tell me about this sooner? cos like I would have been there in a heartbeat
B	I don't know if I could live in
A	I would love to live there
B	but it were just so busy so so busy all the time every hour of the day
A	I love that though I've always loved it every time I've been but I'd like to go back now that I'm that little bit older
B	but I were living out of a suitcase and I were out from eight o'clock in the morning till eleven o'clock twelve o'clock at night so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as what I should have
A	mm yeah
B	because we were doing we had four
A	yeah that's what we were like when we were there
B	so like I'm just thinking like maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it whereas if I had my own flat there or something like
A	yeah I think that's a thing as well cos you were staying in hotels weren't you?
B	yeah
A	we were staying with our friends like in a flat like we got to see the actual like not the tourist part of it if you know what I mean? like we did tourist things obviously
B	yeah
A	but yeah even if it was another three weeks that would be a six week thing over the summer and I would already have so much experience just from six weeks then if I did a three-month paid internship in
B	yeah
A	cos to be honest I'd rather go somewhere else than
B	yeah you definitely need to do an internship though or or and or a placement year
A	a a well I'm hoping that I can do a placement in three months rather than a year
B	yeah
A	erm
B	you still going to think about that study abroad thing?
A	erm I would like to but I didn't get the the grades that I needed in first year
B	like seriously enquire about that because I didn't get the grades
A	well I'm going I'm going to in September I'm going to talk to them and just I'm going to ask what they recommend
B	yeah
A	like whether I do a three-year
B	mm
A	because I don't particularly want to go away for a whole year
B	yeah
A	and I think I'd benefit more from the situation if I was working rather than just studying
B	well an internship the placement year you do get paid for that
A	mm
B	yeah if you do a placement year you get paid for it
A	well I'd much rather do that then
B	so what you do is you do your first and your second year then you do a placement year then you come back and finish your final year in
A	cos eh I was when that guy was staying in
B	yeah
A	and it's like right on my doorstep
B	mm
A	and because I already have a little bit of Spanish but I also have the French and fluent in English he said that I would probably be right at the top of the list
B	yeah
A	and I'm studying international relations I've sort of got everything going for me
B	yeah
A	so I was thinking I'm going to apply for
B	yeah
A	cos if I can do that as part of my course then I won't have to go to
B	yeah
A	but if it comes to it I can just do another placement during the summer cos we've got three months' worth of summer
B	yeah we've got more than that cos our exams finish my last exam was June second that was latest exam so you've got June July August September and then you come back to uni on the first of October
A	yeah I mean my last exam was earlier than that as well
B	so you got like four months exactly
A	it was the end of may
B	so if you finished at the end of May you've got five months
A	so the
B	yeah
A	I could do from I probably go in June to
B	yeah go a bit earlier so it's cheaper
A	and then I could I could always do August in
B	yeah oh did I tell you? Disney's booked
A	yeah you told me
A	it's going to be a fucking nightmare
B	I know but we're there for fourteen days
A	that's really good
B	like we've got a
A	yeah cos to be honest you'll probably get around everything it's going to be in the middle of summer holidays you probably won't but
B	yeah what in America you went?
A	no
A	we erm it was my eighth birthday we were driving down cos like we did every year we always went down for two weeks like drove down from
B	yeah
A	and this is the year that we decided to go to
A	and my parents were like really? do you do you want to look out that that window so I looked out and I just saw the castle and I was like are we really here? is it real? is it real?
A	that's one of my fondest memories of my sister cos
B	I have to meet
A	but
B	yeah but she it was because like she didn't have a relationship with
A	yeah
B	like because
A	but it was just it was so amazing and I remember I don't remember everything cos I was quite young but I remember what it looked like where we were staying I remember always listening to Avril Lavigne Let It Go eh Let Go
B	yeah
A	that album like on my little Walkman I got for my birthday
A	I was like oh my god this is amazing so me and
A	like yeah oh yes
A	and I remember having a pizza in the shape of Mickey Mouse and thinking it was the best thing in the world I was like nothing will ever top this pizza
A	then I found Domino's
A	and I remember we went into a restaurant once and my mam and dad had arranged for Goofy and Minnie Mouse to come and sing Happy Birthday
B	oh
A	I still have a picture of me and my sister with Minnie Mouse somewhere
B	oh so cute
A	so sweet
B	I'm a bit gutted though cos like obviously this has happened with
A	well would there be any way? would it be at all possible for you to maybe arrange everyone pool some money together and your mam and
B	I don't even know if he'll be alive when I go next year
A	or in any case your mam let her be a part of it
B	I might have to talk to
A	yeah
B	but like
A	that might be a nice thing to do
B	but I might even just like I
A	yeah that'll be really nice
B	like even if it means like we're going to fucking I don't know
A	well always welcome to be here even if I'm not here my parents will put you up and that's already rent that you don't have to worry about
B	yeah thank you yeah thank you I really appreciate that you my mam and your parents would get on like a house on fire
A	they really would
B	they really would
A	but to be honest that might be a really nice option to do
B	yeah
A	cos
B	yeah yeah
A	and then if it's nice weather then you get all the stuff of the pool you're an hour away from mountains if it's the winter or even just to go sightseeing like it's so beautiful in the summer
B	yeah yeah
A	and an hour away from the seaside
B	yeah cos I could rent a car or something? or borrow one of your mam's and dad's
A	yeah exactly and there's so much stuff you can do here like we're like forty-five minutes away from a canoeing and kayaking place you can do white-water rafting
B	yeah
A	there's a place actually in
B	wow
A	it's so sweet and there's a massive zip wire that goes across the lake and if you're big enough I've never been able to reach it but if you're tall enough you can slide backwards and put your hands through the water
B	really?
A	yeah I remember there was a bald guy that always used to be our instructor when we went cos like someone always comes up with you
B	yeah
A	and erm he would he he's so tall that he would always go backwards and put his bald head through the water when he was zip wiring
A	but it's so amazing there's loads of different things you can do like a blue one a green one a red one and then a black one it's like a black one is like a pass that gets you everywhere
B	yeah
A	but there's like it's a bit harder
B	right
A	but I always do everything when I'm there and your there for like a good maybe three hours but it's just so much fun
B	yeah
A	we should actually go if you're up for before before we leave cos it's it just takes an afternoon
B	yeah I'll go yeah well I'm I'm still here I'm here for like a week I don't leave till next Wednesday
A	yeah
B	yeah that'd be good
A	well take my parents my mam I don't know cos she gets back on the twenty-first I think
B	yeah
A	well we could go with dad if he's happy to take an afternoon off we could suggest it to him or if not then we could just go as us
B	yeah us three go yeah
A	although I could always ask if other people want to come take a few cars there some of my friends and then we can all go together and then go to the lake cos it's right next to it afterwards
B	yeah
A	and then just spend the afternoon swimming there
B	yeah
A	cos you can take little pedalos out as well
B	really?
A	yeah it's so sweet I can't believe it hadn't thought of it sooner
A	oh really?
B	really?
A	I haven't been for years I think the last time I went was with
B	erm what do you macall it? erm but yeah like I'm going to give them some money like to go on holiday together like if they want to go on holiday together I'm going to give them some money erm but like when it happens and like the funeral is over and done with I'm taking her on holidays I don't even care where it is I take her but I need to get her away do you know what I mean?
A	that would be absolutely amazing yeah
B	well
A	you could look into
A	cos
B	yeah
A	but Thomas Cook do package deals I think it's three hundred and something pounds per person all inclusive
B	yeah
A	so for a week and you get well all inclusive so you get your flights you get the hotel and you get two meals a day
B	yeah
A	like breakfast and dinner
B	that's not bad well erm obviously I don't know when it's going to happen hopefully not for a long time yet but erm I'm probably just going to get a late deal or if I if it's okay for me and my mam to come and stay here then we'll come here
A	obviously we'll we'll talk to my dad about it
B	yeah
A	cos I mean it's still really early early days but I mean like I said they'll be more than happy and they'll get on so well with your mam
B	yeah and your mam will have someone smaller than her so
A	oh exactly she'll love it
B	or the same size at least but yeah thank you for that it means a lot
A	obviously
B	you going to stroke the cat? you're obsessed with those cats
A	I know they're so cute
B	you don't need it you'll want to cuddle it
B	will you just translate to
A	yeah I will do
