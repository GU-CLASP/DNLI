A	when was your first holiday?
B	mine? When? What when I was growing up
A	when you were growing up yeah
B	yeah
A	right
B	and I was busking it through everything else
A	yeah
B	not popular
A	eh the first time on my own was probably Glastonbury
B	oh fantastic
A	I don't know cos I always see Glastonbury as being a holiday
B	oh yeah well it would be wouldn't it yes
A	so yeah I've been
B	when did you go?
A	well I was seventeen so two thousand and seven
B	oh fantastic
A	and I've been every year since
B	right
A	last year? Em
B	thank you
A	I can't remember I've been so many times
B	oh not the dreaded Bono
A	yeah
B	oh they are
A	they are actually good
B	I mean I don't mind listening to U2
A	mm
B	yeah sometimes
A	yeah I mean it there's been quite a wide variety over the years of people that have
B	yes
A	yeah
B	but the thing I think I the one I would
A	yeah
B	yeah that's true
A	I'd I'd quite like to go to a small one cos that's one of the problems I think with Glastonbury is it's just the size
B	it's just so big isn't it? Yes
A	having to queue for like six hours and
B	that's not on is it? Yeah
A	yeah
B	is
A	no well my parents have got a house in Spain
B	oh good
A	but cos it's I've been that many times now it's kind of
B	yes but it's it's not
A	but it's sort of also
B	I see yes
A	so it doesn't seem as much like a holiday
A	right yeah
B	two bedroomed apartment
A	so have you already been?
B	em
A	too
B	which is a thing for me
A	mm
B	right
A	my parents bought the house last year and they're retiring in June and they're moving they're there at the moment to try and set all things up so we've just got
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	wow
A	and some broadband
B	excellent
A	so but that's the problem with my nan
B	right so she's going to have to find somewhere
A	Cos she's too hot
B	that's fair enough it's not a problem is it?
A	throughout August
B	yes yes I must admit I don't think I could do anywhere in the med eh in say July August possibly September
A	I I prefer it
B	yeah absolutely
A	we went to em
A	sounds good
B	so you've done any do you tend to go to Spain cos your parents have got a place there?
A	no yeah I mean we've not been
B	oh yes I bet it was
A	I was still only twenty so I couldn't go to any bars or anything
B	oh right yes of course
A	it was still go though
B	excellent
A	but I'd quite like to go to New York not to New York City to the state and see all the quiet parts rather than
B	yeah
A	that that's my dream too
B	oh that would be good yeah
A	I think
B	got the bloody great hunks of rock
A	not sure
B	ah but you you know the place I mean
A	yeah it must be amazing
B	absolutely yeah
A	that's what I'm looking to do cos we've never been to Cornwall
B	Cornwall is great
A	and with not going to Glastonbury this year
B	Cornwall is nice
A	this year yeah might be having a British holiday
B	yeah
A	I think that's the thing about this country that
B	we've got the weather
A	it's like
B	you need
A	there are so many places
B	yeah but you need the weather
A	yeah I mean that's the thing you can book for
B	yeah
A	five days and then if it was raining
B	and Northumbria is nice
A	we we a couple of years ago my friend got a house is Abesoth
B	oh Abersoch makes me laugh
A	we were there for for a week
B	of course of course
A	but
B	I went
A	yeah it was  it was  yeah nice there
B	you
A	well I mean if the weather was nice it would have been amazing
B	oh yeah
A	yeah on the beach for about half an hour to an hour just to
B	ah no
A	we felt we had to
B	yes quite to make a point
A	but then we just walked
B	yes
A	and just went to the pub and
B	I'll tell you where's good for that
A	mm
B	well of course Methodist view of raffles is gambling
A	that's true
B	it's gambling I said no it's not it's a raffle
A	what what happened when it launched? Cos I never really thought about this
B	absolutely no idea
A	Cos is it ninety-four when it?
B	oh got is it that far back? I was bringing up children at that stage so I can't remember but eh
A	it must have been controversial
B	no no no Bingo is
A	yeah
B	so really it's quite an effective way of saving for something that we all want to do and keep the price within an intelligent limit
A	yeah
B	so if you view it as a saving thing and also
A	you might yeah
B	of course apparently the bigger the syndicate you have the more chance you have of winning but eh
A	I've I've been asked this question a lot and I think buy an old banger drive round America
B	that'd be good
A	eh I wouldn't be particular flash
B	no no no
A	I think I'd just buy
B	what for? Buy in Didsbury? There's more interesting places than Didsbury
A	I suppose yeah
B	oh good grief yes
A	eh that lady in Ireland Dolores wasn't it? She won a hundred and eighteen million
B	wow
A	I definitely wouldn't go public
B	oh no no
A	which is what she did
B	I must be quite honest I think a lot of mine
A	yeah
B	with with a house each and give
A	yeah
B	and it go to the cancer charities to place like Christies and St Anne's you know I some of my favourite ones
A	yeah what can you do? I I
B	oh that'd be a good idea
A	but I wouldn't want to just fritter my money away and not do anything there
B	no no no absolutely not
A	I'd probably open a bar or a restaurant or something like that
B	oh good
A	well exactly
B	what sort of bar? Just a bar? Any
A	like a nice cocktail bar I think
B	that'd be good
A	yeah middle of town
B	that's right yes and it's a
A	yeah
B	what would you do?
A	yeah politics
B	right I see
A	em yeah definitely
B	yeah oh yeah
A	yeah
B	and it was a there's this Easter Island paper just in profile
A	why not a series
B	no I wouldn't mind that actually
A	they're em they're doing a dig in Hume at the moment where em
B	so I believe
A	on Stretford and Berley fields
B	right? What did they find?
A	I'm not sure
B	yes yes yes yeah
A	em so they've just
B	well given that Manchester was a Roman was was a Roman settlement wasn't it? Because they must obviously have had a camp here
A	yes
B	yeah so the chances are if you went to the outlayer and Chester was a a Roman camp as well
A	sustainable
B	absolutely sustainable
A	reuse recycle
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I think the danger with having a big win like that is that you'd get bored
B	yeah
A	unless
B	yeah
A	just bought a big house and
B	I couldn't be doing with that
A	I just couldn't imagine what would you
B	yes exactly exactly
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah definitely
B	yeah
A	yeah so
B	yeah yeah
A	em and I remember that
B	yes yes
A	yeah
B	I I would I I would  I would  get rid of it and then there's no reason for anybody to come pursue in you because you can't give them anything
A	yeah
B	oh yes
A	yeah
B	well if you em there was that amazing documentary well drama doc docu drama form eh about Vivienne Nicholson
A	right
B	who was the first
A	yeah
B	and she just got rid of the whole lot
A	there's a sixteen year old girl from Workington that won the lottery
B	oh that's right
A	he spent it all as well
B	yeah
A	em but sixteen and winning that much money
B	well unless you've got very sensible parents how the hell are you going to know what to do with it
A	yeah
B	yeah absolutely
A	what originally you thought was amazing just become boring after
B	which I I think is probably what would
A	definitely
B	and then just have a bit of and incentive
A	no
B	I'd get bored
A	I'd get bored
B	and also probably kill my husband
A	probably
B	which is one of the reasons why I've gone on working cos I love him to death but twenty-four hours a day
A	I think my dad's worried about that when he retires in June about he
B	right
A	he started yoga about five years ago and he teaches teaches science and maths and he went on a yoga teaching course
B	he can do that when he goes over there
A	yeah I think when he goes over there he's just going to
B	I think the expats will probably bite his hand off
A	yeah
B	well I reckon  I reckon
A	right
B	because they they saw big
A	how big is  How big is  it?
B	it's quite big
A	yes
