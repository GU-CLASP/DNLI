A	oh yeah
B	are you laughing at?
A	no just the music's funny isn't it?
B	what is it? Is it Pendulum?
A	Don't know
B	it sounds like that sort of thing? Ooh could you pass me the mustard? Thank you
A	yeah
B	classic
A	well thought thought they'd already buried it
B	no but
A	yeah uh
B	not the real Beatles obviously cos fifty percent are dead or whatever but
A	right
B	yeah
A	Bobby uh Harrison
B	like Pete Lennon or something
A	flake Harrison
B	aha
B	no Sean Lennon's too
A	we better find out
B	Cos he drums with like
A	yeah but the potential uh
B	that my hair?
A	the attention that he's gonna get is uh enormous cos I mean that's the world's most famous band isn't it?
B	suppose yeah
A	well
B	and I know Gallagher would have something to say about that
A	uhuh
B	well
A	um
B	I'm not sure
A	maybe U2
B	ugh
A	um
B	I was listening to a band that you probably wouldn't like but I probably
A	no
B	they're a bit like you know the Unthanks that sort of
A	well I I thought I liked that actually
B	it's like northern sort of folk
A	oh yeah
B	girl folk I suppose you would call it
B	you know like
A	does it have a distinctly different sound to man folk
B	well there's uhum excuse me
A	yeah
B	they're quite good
A	the Unthanks okay
B	so the Cornshed Sisters are like quite it's quite sort of bit Catherine Tickill-y a bit sort of uh
A	yeah
B	no they're quite good
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	they weren't  they weren't  very big but I guess
B	not massive
A	well they were very trendy
B	Lauren Laverne's done quite well for herself
A	yeah um
B	no
B	what about um Kate Adie
A	at the moment Kate Adie
B	or um
A	think it is her
B	yeah probably is
A	hm
B	no
A	they sounded
B	is that ham in is that um pork in the dinner? Bacon?
A	there's some bacon in there yeah
B	oh it's nice
A	well
B	no it's really tasty
A	have you given it giving it a good write-up? Oh yeah
B	I am giving it a good write-up
A	it reminds me of my old uh shepherd's pies I used to make but
B	yeah
A	it's much healthier than them though
B	no
A	um
B	mince isn't very good for you but it's quite tasty
A	yeah
B	but I'll have to try not to eat too much cos like when we go home at Christmas it's just like mince all the time
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	rather than always getting just getting them to cook it
B	I suppose it's just because she makes like
A	yeah but but she said that we should uh we should do that yeah
B	no I know
A	well it's very rich isn't it?
B	it is rich
A	but um you know that makes it sort of
B	yeah
A	well I'm glad you like it anyway
B	it's really nice
A	oh yeah
B	um saying that we should go to
A	right
B	so
A	yeah
B	but
A	and he was saying like oh we should try and get away somewhere as well
A	yeah
B	but
B	but he copied the email to
A	oh yeah at the bridge place?
B	yeah and
B	there was like twenty-five emails with just tasks
B	like flirting with the old ladies that was like one of
A	yeah
B	um
A	Cos I didn't  I didn't  get the
B	aw
A	um
B	um
A	is this so that like and he's when is his?
A	so he still hasn't said it yet?
B	I said how's how's things coming along at chez
A	well isn't? He's sort of moving isn't he so?
B	no but I meant like with his new house
A	yeah
B	but he didn't reply
B	no I mean like yeah but
A	oh yes
B	I hope not
A	uh yeah
B	I think it's just because
A	I don't know how many people
B	I dunno
A	anyway
B	I know
A	so it's it has a sort of logistical problem uh I think
B	yeah but it's just the sort of fun of going somewhere I think that's part of the thing
A	I suppose so
B	so
A	um
B	anyway
A	yeah
B	hmm?
A	I'll have some more in a minute um
B	it was really nice
A	so I took so it was like uh made by partly by accident cos I made the sort of
B	yeah
A	like the main  the main  meat and potato bit and mixed them together and realized it was only half full
B	fish and potato did you not mean?
A	meat and uh and fish and potato uh
B	yeah
A	mixed them together and realized it only half filled the amount that I wanted
B	aw
A	I realized I'd you know not put enough potatoes or whatever
B	yeah
A	uh I'd also forgotten the peas
B	on the side yeah
A	Cos that's what we normally do for shepherd's pie then
B	that's alright
A	so it had uh has a pea layer and like a meat layer
B	no it was nice
A	pea um leading to the cheesy peas experience at the top
B	I'm hoping
A	um
B	well
A	well I I think it's the temperature partly yeah
B	I know I wonder if I should bring them in
A	um and what I would maybe experiment with is just to get a little uh one of our little bowls and then you know a bit of water
B	yeah
A	you soak  you soak  them for a while then you empty and leave just a bit of water then you put the cling film on the top and you leave them there in in the warm and
B	yeah
A	and once you've sprouted them I guess you're okay to
B	plunk them in?
A	you've got the roots and the
B	they were really hardy last year they the peas they were just like I couldn't like they were grew so much
A	yeah if you gimme gimme a few samples of I might be able to try
B	so
A	or I could just do
B	no but then I'll not know what they are
A	well I'll hopefully remember from the
B	some of them are tiny though
A	alright yeah yeah well we'll we'll do them in do them separately then yeah get lots of like egg cups and like
B	well they're in the little greenhouse now so hopefully that'll keep them a bit warmer
A	yeah
B	the tomatoes have sprouted though
A	the year hasn't been very hot at all
B	I dunno
A	uh
B	was that the summer?
A	well yeah probably
B	it was typical though isn't it? Like in the winter everyone's hoping it's gonna snow  hoping it's gonna snow  Then it snows everyone's whinging hoping it's gonna get warmer
A	oh right I don't I didn't want it to snow like uh
B	and it's warm for two weeks everyone's got hoping it's gonna get cooler then it's cool just for the rest of the year
A	I didn't want it to snow um
B	oh did we? How much was it?
A	uh what I said before um I wasn't that not that pleased with that amount but uh
B	and we did have it cranked up like
A	yeah I dunno what the
B	but it's still not that bad compared to some people's
A	using um where we should've perhaps used the oven instead or if we used uh use it in in different methods
B	what how long was that for? I haven't heard this song for ages
A	we should've perhaps come up with alternative methods to
B	no
A	three months and a few days so it's
B	that's not too bad though
A	but that
B	yeah but
A	you get it gets balanced by the fact that the summer months are much less than twenty pounds they should hopefully be ten pounds a month so
B	it was like
A	yeah I mean I deliberately like sort of
B	once you  once you  make the meal
A	unless it's ridiculous I'd I'd use alternative means basically
B	once you make the meal in the evening it's normally
A	yeah cos I don't need the two back rooms you see uh
B	yeah
A	when I  when I  if I'm sitting here I only use this in the kitchen so if I close that
B	yeah
A	um things like you know the heat from the shower and stuff
B	yeah
A	they do and the sunlight in the front but not in the back cos there's no sun in the back but sunlight in the front will warm it up
B	yeah
A	like by a degree usually
B	yeah
A	um so I yeah I'll just use that rather than
B	I know
A	um and if we'd have cranked it up then it would've cost even more so
B	yeah
A	um but I think we've left it on maybe a few times that we shouldn't have but we had to
B	well
A	yeah
B	we were snowed in like d'you not remember and we had to like we had to force the door?
A	yeah it was uh that was a that was uh uh
B	it wasn't really
A	uh yeah um
B	ah that's right
A	yeah
B	and her wedding was in the seventh wasn't it of January?
A	yeah
B	and then
A	I think we have one each but I'm not sure
B	whooh
A	is that a Swiss roll?
B	no like a jam sponge I suppose
A	is that not what a Swiss roll? Oh just
B	I dunno
A	so it was round
B	it was just like a slice of sponge with jam
B	they always have like hot um
A	I guess you get the pole and you roll the pole over it and you know the they join the the rolling pin and then like
B	oh maybe
A	guess they get the pole and roll the pole over it and then it gets thin and then you fold it over or something
B	I dunno
A	they
B	yeah
A	uh
B	probably is the Beatles
A	India or like like China they don't  they don't  really listen to as much rock as as we do in the West do they?
B	what about Lady Gaga? She's pretty giant
A	yeah if you're
B	oh were we? Sorry
A	well yeah well I said bands so I just meant bands but if you're talking in
B	she's she's got the most followers on Twitter
A	who?
B	lady Gaga
A	oh yeah well that's not really like
B	no I know it's not a measure of everyone in the world
A	yeah yeah cos
B	no
A	has she? More than
B	more than anyone yeah
A	I dunno who who else would it be you know who
B	dunno
A	it's like a religious thing isn't it you know like uh
B	hey that plant's got really big that aloe it's like hanging over the edge of the pot
A	it's still I don't  I don't  know if it's any bigger than it was like when it fell over that time
B	I dunno I think it's looking good
A	but yeah
B	D'you think that tent's gonna be good then?
A	um the picture looks good I dunno what what are the sizes of it? Supposed to be able to sleep four people?
B	dunno
A	can can you genuinely fit four people in that?
B	no well that's the thing like
A	what?
B	sorry
A	really? Well why is it called that then?
B	well it's like how much you could
A	yeah alright so it's just  it's just  precisely
B	but they'd literally be sleeping like hang on like there like that see? Like four like very affectionate people
A	well like a family in other words? Yeah
B	no but I think you
A	yeah
B	well yeah
A	that's it so they all sleep and and their legs are like pointing up to the  to the  front of the tent?
A	uh
B	but it's got two doors
A	yeah
B	so
A	hopefully it's got a good you know ability to to withstand rain then?
B	yeah that's the porch bit
A	it's not gonna just totally get soaked
B	it had good reviews
A	oh that's good
B	um it's got a measure here two thousand droplets
B	um
A	two thousand droplets
B	oh it's in
A	before it leaks
B	uh here's the features
A	alright
B	but I don't know
A	uh let me have a look
B	two thousand droplets
B	that's still a good sketch that
A	it's sort of got
B	is that the
A	is it just open?
B	there?
A	yeah is it? Is that supposed to
B	that's the door
A	that's the front door? I see right
B	what d'you mean doesn't have a fly?
A	everywhere
B	yeah there's an inside tent and an outside sheet
A	right is is it all definitely covered by its? I suppose it must be
B	I think so
A	yeah
B	I mean most tents are like that aren't they? Like inside bit outside bit
A	yeah
B	see what it's
A	right so we'll have to assemble it then
B	right now?
A	well
B	maybe we could assemble it here
A	um
B	why?
A	even more space than this
B	I don't think so I think if we move the sofa and that
A	yeah
B	obviously we wouldn't be able to peg it down to the carpet
A	no
B	you what?
A	I need to finish what I'm doing on the computer so uh
B	yeah
A	hopefully I'll be
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and have like like when you're little and like you make a den? Did you ever do that?
A	well it's good to have a tent in the house so I think it's good yeah
B	did you do that? When you were little?
A	no and I never had a tent and my family never went camping
B	no like
A	A den? No I didn't have any brothers and sisters
B	ah well no but you didn't need to like I used to do it with me nana
A	oh yeah
B	you know like we had one of those um what was it called? Uh a dryer you know those airing rack things? We had one of those that had like three pieces and used to like put that on
A	yeah
B	well we just used to do it in the summer holidays like it would keep
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I never really did it so
B	and I read it on the news today that um the National Trust have issued this like you know Bucket Lists?
A	no
B	bucket Lists like a hundred things to do before
A	book it lists?
B	bucket buh buhcket?
B	aww

B	if it was what?
A	boook
B	to book something?
