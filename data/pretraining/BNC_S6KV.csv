C	and erm and trousers but will you try them on and see if they fit alright? cos I got them from M and S just to see if the might be better than cos the other ones split they every time and I keep
B	what do you do and like?
C	I don't know I'm asking you what are you doing?
D	I know I have told you and you don't believe me I literally
B	what?

B	yeah
D	rip
D	you're not believing me do you think I do the splits? I can't do the splits
D	I think this is this is
D	this is my reasoning
D	I think because I'm small and because it's the smallest size
C	I dunno
B	just er short short
D	I've got I've just got the I'm short I think it's gonna be a bit embarrassing
D	I think the
A	Peppa Pig
D	as in like
D	yes like that is like smaller and it's like so cos like cos I'm older it's like different
D	so basically what I'm saying
B	so what are you saying? is you've got a big arse is that what you're saying?
D	no I'm saying that er
D	because I'm a bit short it's a bit like tighter
C	cos I don't want them to be too small trousers either
D	yeah
C	cos then they'll rip again but
D	cos it if they're too if
B	so they're a bit tight are they?
D	yeah tight there we go
D	they're not tight on my legs but like when you bend when I bend down
B	the
D	the front one
B	okay
C	okay but don't take off the label until you try them on
D	okay
C	so that I can take them back
B	do we have to get him to pick somebody off the ground?
B	just to test them out?
D	what I
C	every time and I was sitting there like sewing
B	couldn't you could we
D	well
C	no he's shown me it's like proposing
D	the only way
D	the only way you can
C	it's like where you're like down on one knee?
D	the only way for you to understand it's like
B	right
D	pick the rubbish up
A	really?
D	if I was to not like break break break my pants I would
B	trousers whichever
D	I'd have to do this
B	so

A	Chewbacca
