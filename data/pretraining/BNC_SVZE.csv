B	didn't have those
C	yeah
A	scary faces they were funny friendly weren't they?
C	yeah yeah they went like this
A	mm
C	and they didn't have big shoes
A	they didn't have big shoes did they?
C	no no
B	remember when
C	I don't know why
B	I wish I was
A	to be silly
B	er one of the girls erm you are
A	you wish you were
B	you are you are you are
B	you are you are you are
A	well we could run away and join the circus if you like
C	okay
A	when you're grown up you could do that couldn't you?
B	yeah but I'll have to teach my children
A	mm? you'll have to teach your children? well I mean before you have your own children we could just pop off to the circus for a bit
C	yeah
B	no way
A	not erm don't wave them at me cos what you're doing is you're using them
B	the circus is for life until if until you do something bad and you get
A	so
B	circus is bad unless you die and er
A	circus is bad unless you die?
B	circus is for life unless you die and
A	where do you get that from?
B	well
A	mm?
C	what does that mean?
B	I know
A	you mean that people should do it forever?
B	I just know
A	you can do it however long you want though
B	really?
A	yeah course but then they get injuries or they have children I mean some people do still do it with children
C	yeah
B	yeah like erm
C	children are the heart of the circus
B	like Enzo
A	who's Enzo?
C	Enzo Romaldi
A	oh
A	in the Adventure Island thing mm
C	mm
A	sit down
B	I'm going to get some chocolate
A	no you're gonna sit down
B	I want the egg
A	you haven't asked me to get up from your chair and you are
B	I'm gonna
A	not gonna get up
B	I'm gonna get some chocolate
A	no you're not gonna get some chocolate
B	why?
C	it's amazing to think that those people in the circus erm er mm erm imagining to are managing to do exactly what erm you mm could have been able to do
A	mm what? in the old times you mean?
C	no I mean
A	have you noticed you're using your finger there?
C	yeah
A	don't do it
B	I
A	what do you mean?
B	mm
C	well you could've learnt how to do the be in a circus
A	mm but I
C	mm did you know the about the trapeze?
A	yes but I if I
A	but if I went if I was now if I was at school now I'd be thinking do you know what? I might go and join the circus for a little bit I might do
B	but never join it
B	well we won't be with you so there
C	I wonder what I'd do in the circus
A	you could do trapeze or be a clown
B	no way not a clown
A	you could be a dancer you could be a hula hooper
B	I like that lady who was like that and er she could
A	holding the cube and spinning it
B	yeah erm I can spit on my hand
A	well she was the hula hooper so you'd be her now the reason why you can't have chocolate is because what did you have as a snack when you got home?
