C	okay
D	you want neutrals as well though right?
A	no

C	that's quite hard because we're in Wales or are we? and in Wales fire is tan
A	very good
B	mm
C	more I can see more than two
A	tan two
C	that's not helping is it? oh we've also got fighter fire fighter
A	mm
C	mm
A	okay
C	mm
D	mm
C	mm
D	so
B	why can that be neutral and not wrong?
A	cos it just
B	oh right okay
A	if so in the future if I say octopus two and it you find tentacle and you find
C	oh
A	pick the one
C	why didn't you tell me that before?
A	I don't know okay
C	okay
D	mm
B	okay so construction yard
A	you can go you could
B	right okay does that lose me any points or is it worth doing that?
A	it's worth doing it if you're right if you're wrong then there's you'll
B	oh right okay oh no right okay so yard bridge
D	and this yeah
B	oh okay well that's better than
A	okay then
B	oh what else was construction?
A	mother
C	yeah?
C	it is
A	okay
C	conductor bolt
A	oh
C	to pick another one that goes with lightning?
A	ah in other words based on what I've said or based on what I've said before
C	another two?
A	no you can do one more
C	oh yeah
A	that was tan
A	but I didn't see anyway
D	go on then
D	I've said it now erm trees
D	two
B	spring
D	erm
C	doctor
B	oh Dolittle
C	oh Dolittle
B	no
C	oh
B	I can't can't put that either
D	erm yeah
A	so we could win the game now if we got a three
C	mm mm
A	oh and they've got a two
B	the way I'm going that's quite likely
D	now it's me
A	Blackbeard two
B	what did you just
A	see I just
A	that could relate to Blackbeard
A	is that your final answer?
C	am I allowed to give any more?
A	yeah
C	no I'm leaving it at that
A	black beard black beard
A	black beard where do we see a beard?
D	don't know it's
A	I did not see him as a fighter
A	at all
D	of course he
D	he's not a lover is he?
A	also you've got deck there as well haven't you?
C	yeah
A	and he was famously a pirate
A	and that tan I didn't see Greece or orange
A	I just don't see them
B	did
A	do you girls want a go?
B	did
B	does tan mean fire then?
A	in Welsh
D	yeah
A	Sam tan
A	but also in the
B	oh so it's Sam tan?
A	in the rules
B	Sam fire?
D	Fireman Sam
A	yeah
B	well what's
D	yeah
A	right
B	what's fireman then?
A	but in a lot in Wales especially like like you know Ivor the Engine?
B	yeah
A	like your name if you were the brakesman you would be
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	or what's the one in the caf√©? anyway you would be your name plus not necessarily your profession but what you've dealt with
B	oh
A	like
B	okay
A	Johnny Coal if he was coal deliverer rather than Johnny the coal deliverer
B	so that's why he's
A	so but in the rules I couldn't have gone fire because then would have
B	yeah
A	cos otherwise you'd have three clues and there would be
B	yeah
A	and you'd go and you'd do it in a ridiculous French accent
B	okay
A	why don't you girls
C	no
A	have a go?
C	no
A	are you sure? it'll be funny
A	oh go on
B	yeah go on we can do it
C	no
A	go on
C	no no
A	you can do it
C	no no no
A	five minutes now there'll be new words
C	no
C	go on then
C	and then I'm going to bed
A	last one then
C	yeah
A	right? so obviously that is the black one there
C	yeah
A	it goes across like that yeah? so we'll need to be getting all the blues so in this case it's this
C	card
A	so you girls sit by there we can we'll put then we'll put the cards round facing you so it's a bit
C	okay
A	bring the sofa forward if you want love and then you can both sit on it rather than someone on the floor what's that bottle?
B	oh right it's alright it's on this
B	it's really annoying this big
C	I think it might actually fit on that
A	no
D	but we both know where the black one is
A	no and I'll change the grid
D	yeah yeah so don't worry about that
A	have we done these words?
D	yeah we had seven like you scored
A	quite excited
B	that
A	okay
C	okay
B	okay
A	we're reds
B	reds
A	so a bit like a
D	well yeah
A	don't really get how
D	but that's why I think it's
A	in both of them?
B	yeah
D	in the sort of waiting you know and the whole team is waiting for
A	and also in Articulate even though you're it's not your go you're still listening so it's funny and it's just
D	yeah I mean yeah you're right it's a really good game and it's really clever
A	mm
D	but I think it's got
D	yeah yeah
A	and there must be two hundred
D	I think there should be
A	well just play it like Hanabi where you're trying to beat the score
D	I think it should be timed you know timed or
A	yeah yeah
D	yeah there's just a lot of downtime and silence
A	mm
B	see I've just been looking at my colour now and I realised I've got to double check that it doesn't match
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so that's why three's really hard to get really
B	mm
A	it's only a two you're really gonna get
C	I'm ready
B	I've got one yeah
A	alright? who wants to go first?
D	well mum said first
B	yeah
A	okay so you go out with the blues then mum
C	okay
A	how many?
C	two
D	okay
A	log
B	er wealthy two
D	wealthy two
D	or
B	yeah?
D	yeah
D	oh
A	could have been worse could have been worse
D	I think I know what the the third one was
A	roulettes means little wheel in French
D	mm
A	listened to that stuff you should know podcast last night about casinos where they started
D	oh right
A	how they how far they can date back the first casino of er in Venice I think the first one was
D	when?
A	sixties
D	that was a long time ago
A	they found a dice in Pompeii
D	snakes er snake eyes
A	don't know what they were landing on
D	you know dead man's hand right?
A	mm
D	yeah
A	and two eights or not
D	well you saw it in Deadwood it was a
A	yeah I read about that I read a lot about Deadwood the actual town actually the erm
D	the what wasn't it it's the sort of an exaggeration that how many deaths are actually
A	what at Deadwood?
D	were not just Deadwood like what's the what's the famous grave er Boothill or
A	yeah
D	not actually that many
A	it was a tough time though wasn't it? you were doing well to get to thirty or forty
D	yeah but I'm just talking like from duels and gun fights it wasn't as
A	well probably be diseases but it's not as good TV is it?
D	yeah well that's what I'm saying it perpetuates this like really violent time whereas
A	oh I don't know got all these people from all over the world though you know trying to get on with your
D	no but if you've got the graveyards are a good indication right and on the
A	yeah
D	things that there's not actually
A	well
D	there's not many that's a shot like
A	Mr Mr Wu's pigs
D	yeah
A	we've just got to the part where there's the new celestial
D	yeah who speaks English
A	mm big advantage
C	I've got a problem I can't get
A	discuss it with anyone
C	I can't get even two
A	you could get a you can get a one
C	well that's
A	but in
C	not very good is it?
A	I'd go for a two
C	yeah I'm not getting a two
A	I couldn't link at all smuggler luck and face at all
D	really?
A	erm you think luck and face I mean it's smugglers smuggler's quite
D	yes
A	a hard one
D	I was trying to get orange and whale together
C	okay
B	mm
A	that's the one to go for
C	okay
D	okay
C	wheel
A	how many?
C	two
A	I was listening to a podcast the other night and they were talking about casinos and roulette is French for little wheel
B	you just said that
D	I know
B	oh
A	so okay
B	I had a a little bit of a
D	he does repeat himself
B	blip blip in in the matrix
A	it isn't a wheel date
C	two
A	well I got
D	but can you
D	but can you put three on?
A	yeah I could do but I
D	mm
A	it being a colour so I will guess roulette and circle
D	no
A	steady progress yeah?
C	steady progress
B	music
C	mm mm
D	oh you're straight in there no
B	two
D	music so I'm seeing concert and I'm seeing
C	what did you say
B	music
D	so I'm gonna say concert and church
B	yeah
D	haven't I? and I'm gonna say mint
B	oh
A	there we are
B	very good
C	mm
B	why did you say mint?
D	well you said wealthy
B	yes
D	and it's minted
A	but you can't say
B	oh I can't
A	you can't say that's right because he could just be really lucky and got a right one
B	oh okay
A	but you yeah
C	mm
A	alright so mum one two three four one two three four
D	you know it could be like the first past the first to the post you know who who comes up with a clue first gets a go and then
A	yeah but you're just gonna say ones then so
D	like I
D	well without ones
A	isn't bad cos it just makes you say funny ones which will be really wrong
C	yeah and that it's I think it's a good idea to have a timer on it cos then I'd have
A	yeah
C	be quicker I'm gonna say I haven't got one but I'm gonna say prehistoric
A	how many?
C	one
A	oh right so I would I'd like to think it was
A	mammoth wouldn't you?
C	mm
D	well it's
A	no
C	no way
D	uhu
A	really?
D	yeah we don't think of it do we?
A	they were meant to bring them back in the nineties and where are they? here we are look sixteen years later haven't done anything have they?
C	I don't want them back
A	I think
D	what do you mean you don't want them back?
C	no well if they got extinct
D	leave them dead
C	leave them there
A	leave them be
D	losers
A	let
C	yeah
A	relax
C	yeah
D	dodos?
D	what about what about dodos? they messed around
A	can you imagine
C	just imagine messing around
A	imagine the cape you could wear with mammoth fur?
B	erm
D	imagine the ivory
B	close
A	okay I'll go for dress and cotton
A	oh
B	but I thought that but it was right at the end
B	that like I was oh
A	clothes tie then was it?
B	tie
A	yeah but tie's less than clothes than dress
B	I know but I thought the fact that you'd made me I it was looking like oh this is a bit of a struggle that dress would be too obvious
A	no
D	you're but we're on the same team
B	no I know
B	so I thought you'd be like well she's really like she didn't she's really trying to struggle those ones together so dress is a bit too obvious so it must be tie and cotton
D	how can a clue
D	be too good? too obviously
D	didn't even enter my head that that would
B	no
B	didn't even look for tie though you just kind of went straight to those
A	if you'd
B	oh
B	I really didn't have anything I was really struggling
A	I think sometimes it's a fault of pride as well like you don't wanna be the guy who goes one so you'll do it
B	yeah
A	stretch to a two
C	two
A	and you'll stretch to a three
D	yeah but
C	yeah
D	she's I mean there's there's a case for
C	oh
D	there's a case
C	like the ones I had left that were March shop dwarf and date how can you make something with those?
D	well er March and date you know they're both indicators of time
A	you could say St
B	or calendar
D	yeah
A	or calendar
C	mm shopping for dwarf clothing?
C	what do I do with that one then?
D	little yeah
C	little little
D	er
C	little clothes no
B	I had mole
A	that would be harder
B	tick and tie
C	yeah
B	what do you do with mole tick and die?
C	dunno
A	if you had if you had said silk silk tie and silk is like a fabric it's like cotton and you could oh no dress was the bad one
A	do you?
B	yeah
A	it's a minefield
C	it's a minefield
A	two assassinations then
B	uhu
C	uhu
A	good though no?
B	definitely yeah it is good
C	very good
A	it's hard isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I think you need to be the person giving clues
B	must have you played this with people students?
A	no I could play it I could mm
B	these are for good level like it's hard
A	it's really difficult yeah
B	isn't it?
A	yeah it is hard you'd only get ones or two
B	yeah
A	I think you'd just do it for ones or twos
B	if you got a two it's got to be something that's really obvious
A	well like a
B	no?
A	no but like I had like pig pyramid and Aztec so you
B	yeah
D	yeah but a lot of the connections are I think can be on a colloquial
A	yeah no yeah
D	or a cultural
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	rather than
A	no but I think if you
B	yeah
A	the score chart there and just say
B	yeah
A	if you get four points then we're doing really good if you get five points then
B	but it's pretty straightforward
A	also also you can kind of make it where you've got Antarctica and cold and like you can design the ones to choose actually you don't have to follow the grid
D	uhu
A	and just try and find links so you could just go
B	yeah
A	snow Antarctica
D	yeah yeah
A	and just go cold and then
B	yeah
A	you know they'd feel happy they'd feel
B	it's quite a good game that you could have a pack of these in your classroom
A	yeah
B	and when anyone finishes you can just say oh go and get them
A	but yeah the nuance and the intricacies come from being using colloquial language and
B	yeah
A	clever
B	have you got bags to put these in? worried about bits and bobs getting lost
B	only little
A	but I think as well if you play like you'll appreciate it playing it on the other side now like you've given clues I reckon you realise
B	well I think I knew how hard it was
D	I think twice I saw the as soon as I said something it's like oh right
A	yeah
D	er well there's that
B	I only realise after about five minutes of finding my own clues that I needed to look at what
A	uhu
B	so
D	well let me know then if there's anything you want
A	yeah
D	I'll tell him to bring his
A	so that's three then yeah
D	are you?
A	are we not gonna go to a shop at all for a week? that's mad
B	no I think we're gonna go on Thursday on the way
A	oh to
B	yeah
A	so only for tomorrow so
B	mm
A	no it's not no it's I well if other stuff
B	oh no
D	you didn't bring your putty?
A	I've run out I went excessive on Monday
B	yeah
A	yeah no it's not something I've got sort of it's a very specific brand and type of
B	he's probably alright to use whatever until
A	well
B	mm
D	in the country probably wear a hat
A	well baby time tomorrow then
B	yeah
B	plan tomorrow? that you boys are gonna play what are you playing? what's the big thing you've got?
D	just
B	Pandemic Legacy or something?
D	just yeah
A	in the night I would imagine that'll be
D	yeah but not too late though cos you know dad will
B	does it go on for a long time?
D	yeah it's like an hour a
A	well we'll have to recap as well
D	yeah
B	okay well that's not
A	no I'm not
B	no I'm just saying like just say when you wanna play and go and play it
A	yeah
D	well er we
A	oh
D	for a walk
A	to the
D	so yeah I was gonna meet
A	I dunno it depends what
D	oh yeah
A	depends on what
D	yeah
A	I would drive down he'd wanna go
D	yeah
A	probably let's drive down the
D	okay
A	that would be a good meeting to meet someone in a
D	yeah or send send a nice
B	it's like dozy flies have you noticed them?
A	for what? for the
D	for the
A	oh the meeting
D	oh yeah yeah sorry yeah
A	and he's got a car now and everything
B	well he can leave
D	you think
A	er I don't know I don't know if he would want that
B	okay
A	would you leave your baby on a farm?
B	with responsible people
A	unattended?
B	yeah
A	well I don't know if you would
D	I think it would
B	yeah
D	if it was your first one
B	jesus
A	there's loads yeah there's we
B	but just like dopey like you know normally they're
A	sharper aren't they usually with it
B	drinking all the cider
A	I reckon there's a dead bat or something you know a
B	do you think? do you think that's why there's so many in our room?
A	they're all dead you don't normally see dead flies
B	there's a few flies up on that balcony thing as well though it's weird and a
A	in some kind of
B	like March
A	suicide
B	cold
A	suicide pact
B	well then maybe we'll steer away from the murder mystery thing
B	okay
A	what was it though? I didn't know anything about it I'm a bit I feel a bit embarrassed being in a role and I
B	yeah well then we can
A	no I'm just saying like what was it like?
B	it was just
A	what was it?
B	erm
A	so you have to you have to do like interview each other do you?
B	you have to like to pretend to be different characters
A	but they where do you find the evidence round the house or what?
B	no I've got like a pack to give each of you that you read
D	well it might be quite cool
B	yeah
D	right
B	so you could read it have your whatever chat for fifteen minutes
D	right
B	and then
A	be about an hour or something
B	probably wrap it up in an hour of you wanted to
A	yeah
D	mm
B	but equally it could be saved for another time cos it's not got any
A	would you go to a murder mystery weekend?
B	yeah
A	would you?
B	I'd love to
A	yeah I dunno if they still do them so much
B	but some are like scary
A	I think they were quite quite they were quite in vogue I think like in the eighties and nineties
B	yeah well
A	I don't know if they still have them
B	there's a hotel outside
A	good money for them isn't it?
A	we went to a good one and that was in like a stately home in like the
B	yeah?
A	and it was just actors in a room and when you go in and you'd you they had like a a bandage on a hand and you'd say like where did you get that? and they were kind of you had this little notebook and that it was cool
B	oh
D	don't know probably
A	what's his brother's flat like?
D	very nice and he's done it really he's done it really nice as well
A	yeah
D	he's quite he's quite you know tidy and particular and he has you know he's
D	yeah and he's got you know he has proper places for things like all his trainers in proper racks
A	when you live on your own as well I think you can do that a bit more can't you?
D	yeah
A	why?
A	racy?
D	blokey or
B	what were they posters of?
D	well
D	lots of Wes Anderson stuff or The Shining maybe or I dunno I don't know what
A	uni posters
B	so film posters that's
D	no but like they're all really nice in frames
B	oh in frames?
D	but yeah yeah he puts everything in frames yeah he's particular about that
B	right so she's
A	cos she's banging on about posters in frames
B	yeah I can't
D	posters are
B	well it just looks nicer some of them
A	bit like
D	coasters cushions and frames
B	I know honestly
D	coasters are the only ones of those that are necessary
B	cushions could be nice
A	they're not necessary
A	like all these just get in the way of the sofa
B	mm they do help a little bit
D	no they they're good you know leaning back and have something there sort of when you're watching
B	you what's that one behind your head doing?
A	I'd be much more comfortable

A	one between your leg
B	to make the bed
A	one to
D	when are these
A	one to cry into
D	when have you
A	oh yeah
D	come I've just started
B	it's very good for your back
A	it's because I used to do
D	yeah yeah
A	had to do it
D	okay
A	and er just tried it one night out of curiosity and it was er I don't like my knees knocking together like that and
B	so
A	and it pushes your hip I've got a bad hip so it pushes your hip like artificially back
D	no I was I was for it
A	like that
D	put it in yeah I can't go back now that's it
B	your your knees knock?
D	well they just
A	no not knock but just that
D	you know
A	those that bone there going into this bone
D	yeah it's
D	not
B	don't you kind of sleep like a bit?
A	no cos that hurts my back
B	oh okay so I can't sleep on my back I don't know how people sleep on their backs
D	do you know how the Elizabethans slept?
B	what sleeping?
D	yeah
B	like sitting up?
D	yeah sitting up yeah
B	why?
D	because er lying down was the sleep of the dead
B	oh jesus
A	they thought they'd get they thought someone would
B	but you can sleep sitting up but it's or for me anyway it's when you're absolutely exhausted like I couldn't just sit and
A	train sleeping
B	yeah
A	mm can't
B	fucking hell I had to
A	I don't think you liked it then
B	seriously?
D	oh
B	bloody flies they're fucking annoying
A	swaying like that
B	erm I slept in a hammock not as comfy as you think actually
D	really?
A	no I don't like them
B	no
A	I don't like the like it's for like bad reggae
B	no no I had no choice there was no other er it was on a beach and that was
B	what you slept on
A	I'm just saying
B	but like
A	that's why I don't like about them
B	I wouldn't I'd never do it again out of choice
D	is that why you didn't like it?
B	yeah like which stops you
D	mm
B	especially it depends how you sleep I think if you sleep on your back it would probably be quite nice but cos I can't
A	what's that smell?
B	dunno just beer
B	I don't smell that
D	mm just that after reading that it's in there
B	mm don't like
A	is that a fly?
B	yeah
A	they are on the sweet sauce aren't they?
B	something's wrong with them
A	and they've got the get up and go
B	oh maybe they're around a lot because of the sheep
A	heard that
B	or around honey
A	yeah that's the one
B	is that wasps or
A	what's your favourite insect?
B	I dunno but the other day one of my students little kid suddenly went
A	no
B	it's like
A	you mean a mountain jumper?
B	oh I can't remember
B	that's it I was like I know exactly what you're talking about
D	you've played Hive?
A	no I was talking about it with
B	oh
A	yeah it looks really yeah
B	you'd like it it's very
A	no but you're I think you'd be
B	yeah
A	overall
D	you've got the travel in the pocket sort of
A	yeah it's so actually I've never seen the erm real one but I saw it in a shop the other day and they were massive
B	what does it er
A	they're really nice like a Bakelite one
B	does it come with a
A	no
B	like a chess board if you buy the normal set?
A	no off the board
B	oh
A	off
B	but does it come with bigger pieces?
A	bigger pieces and not the
D	yeah
A	mosquito
B	it would be cool I always thought if it
A	you lose you cos sometimes don't know if a
D	oh okay yeah
A	one in exactly right and it kind of that's
B	cos that would look really cool like a big it would like like a hive
A	yeah
B	no?
B	mm
A	travel light
B	yeah I liked it it took me ages to to crack it though I kept forgetting what they all did
A	not fun is it though? it's like a thinker
B	no it was a thinker
A	but
D	you still haven't played that
D	no no no it's that game I told you about that
A	mm
D	and then you had all the pieces were rooks
A	mm
D	erm
A	that might be
D	and I think you had one one row er of you know you had one row to yourself and they had another row just rooks and your your colour
A	oh okay yeah yeah
D	and and end on
A	yeah
D	you know purple meaning you'd have to move the purple
A	right okay
D	and the aim
A	I haven't played that
D	and the aim of the game was to
A	ah okay what so
D	and you know and
A	when you're playing?
D	er
A	right okay
D	but really so you know you're
A	yeah yeah
D	really clever but
A	yeah
D	oh okay
A	so you know if I put this one in this position when I flip it over at the end of my turn it is gonna go in this one so you're kind of thinking
D	mm
A	if you were the head
D	is that the random one? er is yeah cos they didn't they talk about a chess that was random you know it
A	well
D	okay
A	but no with that
B	an error
A	basic catastrophic error
B	yeah
A	to lose and you're just like slow defeat
D	and it's no draw it's
B	yeah
D	inserts
A	yeah and then you can either add a new one but you've got to add three each and then you can either move your like make an attack or add a new one in so you can have someone who's attacking all the time but only got four insects as opposed to someone who's
D	yeah
A	kind of on the back foot but they've got six insects now of all the different types and they work well together and stuff
B	it's not very like sociable though as a game
A	oh
B	is it? like it's you're not chatting while you're doing it cos you're quite concentrated and getting like two or three moves ahead of yourself aren't you?
A	I think we did it
B	we used it always as a
A	yeah
B	like waiting for food cos that took a long time cos they often went to kill the animal
A	yeah
B	and bring it back on a on a
D	I think that's fine
A	you can have a served and you've food right and they go yeah and they go alright and then it would be about honestly about two hours
D	oh right
A	and you
A	with the dead chicken
B	it's so like
A	tell that
B	just tell me like I really don't mind if you've only got two dishes just tell me the ones you've got and I'll I'll have them
A	mm
B	it's fine don't tell me you've got it and then go
A	he'll just leave you in his restaurant and no one no one er
B	apparently one of the Nepalese things is they don't like to say no so if you ask them for directions even if they didn't know where it was they would just tell you something
D	oh
B	cos they felt that was a better
D	like most men
A	no well like there's there's they it was the worst thing in their custom to do really isn't it? so they
D	as things go
A	yeah not a bad not a bad bunch I think
B	no they were nice
D	did you hear back from your adopted children in Nepal?
A	I might
D	not a letter?
A	not even a text on my birthday
B	what adopted children?
B	ah did you? I didn't know that
A	well not adopted like you
D	yeah
A	pencils
D	er school equipment for
B	oh I didn't know that
A	I told you
B	no you didn't
A	yes I did
B	what what what did we give them?
A	little Sangeet
D	erm just yeah school equipment textbooks erm
A	for fifty of the little bastards
D	yeah
B	do we know where?
D	I've sent
B	oh send it to me
A	I think er
D	I
A	you didn't say
B	no
A	you didn't say where it was in in Nepal I don't maybe they don't do that maybe you're not allowed or whatever I don't know
D	I think I didn't send it to you
A	you printed yeah I've got the printout
D	a print er yeah I didn't send it to you cos I thought I I was gonna tell you when you came down or something but
B	oh
D	yeah
A	so hopefully when they get their degrees
D	they should
A	er medicine in ten years' time
D	you should have you should have heard back by now though
A	and you get free treatment
B	maybe
D	and they come over here taking British doctors'
B	well they won't be able to come because unless they're earning a certain amount
A	eh?
D	yeah
B	they won't be allowed to work here pretty sure it takes
A	well his English has got to be top notch as well hasn't it? if they're from
B	I don't think you get the rate that the money that they're saying you don't get that for a doctor for a while
D	saw that
B	in the next five years
D	yeah
A	they won't though
B	I know they won't but I think there'll be a big
A	yeah a big
B	I think a lot of them are going
B	there's apparently junior doctors said the same thing didn't they?
A	no I think you
B	I think they're a bit different cos that's seriously that's quite dangerous
A	and
B	but didn't say that something like the day that it got that Jeremy Hunt's thing got announced that
D	yeah
B	two thousand percent
D	I mean if you know it's not like fifty years ago when it you can
B	no
D	right you if you've got transferable skills and language
A	and it's really only Australia and Canada and New Zealand
B	cos of the language thing?
D	and America
B	that's hard
A	mm America's really
D	difficult to get the visa
B	yeah
A	really difficult
D	but still you know that's more options than
B	mm
D	than Britain right?
A	yeah
D	who?
A	the Tories
D	well it's
A	yeah but
D	and
A	it's not gonna make the front pages like it would have done
D	and it and it's still left four point four billion
A	no yeah no it's just
D	well
A	people have short memories
B	what the U-turn
A	people will priories
B	has said that they won't cut the
A	yeah
B	disability?
D	it's not looking good for the
A	it's so bad though
D	for the next election though is it? I mean if you know a U-turn on that you know the the you know junior the doctors striking
B	it's just so far away to the next election though isn't it?
A	yeah
B	unless they keep fucking up until then
A	I don't see people you know
D	and he didn't apologise
B	who Gordon erm?
D	George Osborne
B	George Osborne no it's they never apologise they do that thing where they go well I'm sorry that you feel that
A	cos he meant to do it
D	yeah of course he did
A	I'm sorry if any offence was caused
B	mm
D	let's talk about the big ones ladybirds
B	ladybirds are pretty cool
D	obviously are quite nice
B	I always sometimes wonder if they're actually really mean and they've got like a really good press department
A	look the part but actually they're evil bitches underneath
B	yeah
D	it's caterpillars for me
B	yeah? does that then stop when they become butterflies?
D	well that's why they're so great
B	yeah
D	uhu
B	are they doing it because they're just really tired
B	and they're very full cos they've been eating a lot and they're getting ready for that?
D	yeah
B	preparing for it and someone's told them you have to do this
D	oh well yeah I mean you're asking a deep question about animal consciousness? I don't
A	does anyone want a drink?
D	which you can't ever know
B	alright for the minute thanks
D	you know like bears
B	so they do know to hibernate then
B	right yeah
D	you know
B	they are aware that they're supposed to do you think? is a better word or
D	well I don't like supposed I mean
B	yeah
D	they they they eat when they can
B	yeah
D	I I I don't know if
B	yeah
D	by November or
B	or is somebody passing the message along?
A	who's what?
B	but like does do bears communicate with each other and tell them like it's coming up like does mamma bear tell the baby bear like to pass on the knowledge like in the same way that they teach
D	no cos that's now that's
B	them to do everything?
D	yeah but no but time is an abstract and the future is an abstract concept or it's not
A	it's the change in temperature isn't it
B	mm
A	why they hibernate?
D	well yeah it's a combination of things but it's
A	but if you
D	no they still well they still need the food they still need there's scarcity of cos you know there's food the
A	no yeah
A	you can make an animal hibernate by putting it in the fridge for example
B	where do they go?
A	tortoises?
B	no like bears
A	little burrow
B	do they go underground?
A	yeah
B	they go make themselves a little
A	yeah
B	by themselves or do they go with?
D	it's the well it's the mother and the
A	all the lads together isn't it?
D	yeah the mother yeah I I don't think yeah on their own I think
B	and they generally just sleep?
D	yeah
A	cos they're cold and it's
D	they might take a good book in with them if they can find it
A	it's not sleeping
B	right
D	it's like in a coma almost
B	but it's weird though cos they are really prepared for that weather if anyone was gonna survive it
A	yeah but why why do it if you don't have to? there's no food
B	yeah
A	at all
B	do any other animals hibernate?
A	tortoise
B	a bear
D	yeah
A	yeah I don't know what else er squirrels? no I don't think
D	no
A	mm
B	no they stay
D	yeah yeah
B	collect them all
D	yeah so the you know they're active
B	yeah
D	in winter
B	pretty mean though
A	mm
D	well
B	Gentle Ben they ain't
A	no
A	no they are I mean I mean
B	pandas just look like they are got the they are zoned out of their minds
A	what do er
B	all the time
A	what do we all think about Chris Packham's view? his illegal view
B	why what's that?
A	he
B	get rid of pandas?
A	that's Packham saying that as well and he loves animals
B	why does he say that?
A	cos he thinks they're an evolutionary dead end his words
D	cos er
A	Chris Packham
D	they shouldn't need this much sort of er artificial er support you know to
B	no
D	survive
B	but have they not died about because people have deliberately
D	not
B	hunted them?
D	necessarily
A	not really no
D	they don't have sex a lot and
B	oh right okay
A	they don't they
B	right
D	even if they you know
A	and they don't have sex
D	which is which is nuts
A	you know they
B	but when their babies are born they are they always always been artificially
A	a lot of them are yeah
D	well not
B	really?
A	mm
D	but they do in they do artificially inseminate them as well now they they just don't they're not very
A	panda porn
D	panda porn though
A	don't have a lot of
D	you know
A	get up and go do they?
B	it's quite true though really what he says really
D	yeah but then
A	well they keep it cos they're a nice looker anyway
B	yeah but it it
A	but maybe they'll change
B	they do cos a lot
A	maybe they'll change their ways
B	they take a lot of
A	to who? they don't cost money they they make money
B	no but it terms of it must be a huge
A	they make
B	if you said that
A	zoos make money off them in Europe and er the Chinese are them for political political gain
D	but again I mean
B	are we forcing nature though?
D	but er yeah I mean that's that's
A	well we're forcing nature in every single thing we do but why?
D	and that's a bad thing though right they're used as political tokenism and
A	yeah I'm not saying they only keep them cos they keep them in a zoo do everything that man so make to preserve their natural habitats
B	how many are there in the wild now?
D	yeah not many
B	mm I think his point is that other species that er in bigger problems that aren't as
D	no I well yeah yeah
A	er er and and
D	yeah
A	and deserve our money more because at least they're trying
D	but also
B	well
D	I mean you just film that's that seal that penguin
A	mm
D	its
A	mm
D	and that's not really happening with pandas
A	no
B	yeah I saw one went to see it in Mexico City zoo
A	bet that was shit
D	oh
B	yeah but it was just quite fascinating to watch it
A	why did you go to a zoo? that's not like you
B	no cos I wanted to see a panda cos I knew it would be the only chance I'd ever get in my life to see one
A	in Mexico
B	yeah
A	it's got one in Edinburgh zoo
B	is there?
D	yeah
A	there was more pandas than Tory politicians at one point
B	okay
D	you've seen those adverts for the panda?
A	don't don't have time for adverts
B	no I don't think so
D	mm okay I might have to google it
B	did you see the pictures of?
A	I saw play I saw that the kids going down the slide and all that
B	did you see the Justin Trudeau with his to the two baby pandas when they were born
A	jesus christ
B	properly cute
A	shouldn't be touching them
B	they were given by they were given by the Chinese? or giving them to the
A	I don't think
A	I don't think they would donate Canada was giving pandas to
A	here's some chow mein and a panda
D	bring it on
B	mm
D	oh my god
B	meeting a lady about
D	he's so busy
B	is he having a
D	he's always doing things
B	is he having a festival?
D	a
B	I wouldn't put it past him
D	okay it's only three minutes long another weird
A	is that in Britain?
D	no it's sort of Singapore or
A	so some type of feta cheese
A	that's cool
B	where's it from?
A	Japan is it
D	it's a really strange choice of song it's great
A	oh it's cool though isn't it? really David Lynch
B	it's quite a range
D	mm
A	oh
A	good adverts
D	good advert right?
A	that's a good one
B	as much as I hate them sometimes you have got to give them a little
D	so they should save the pandas?
A	I think so
A	got ale ale pops
B	cos that's definitely one thing you don't get with cider do you? but you do feel definitely a bit
D	well flat ones
A	definitely the flat ones yeah no bubbles in that
B	it's cos there's no bubbles in it helps
A	do you like it?
B	mm
A	what's the drink round your way?
B	there's a
B	yeah but there's nothing
A	like iconic drink is there?
B	no I don't think
A	that's like the yeast that's where they make a lot of the yeast for Marmite up and they had a brewery there but
B	yeah
A	I don't know what ale possibly
B	but no I don't
A	no I don't think so
B	no
A	yeah
B	try and get some sleep in the bank especially if I'm going to have to be on
A	table tennis
B	table tennis tournament or
A	like
B	I bet he can play a bit of
A	he's not masculine enough
A	no
D	those forearms
A	too apologetic
D	I dunno those forearms
A	yeah
D	it's you don't
A	he's too he's too polite to win a point
