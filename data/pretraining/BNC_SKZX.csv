C	howdy got a guitar today wow exclamation which one? Martin DX one AE one down from Ed Sheeran's
C	it's a beauty
B	yeah
A	what did he think?
B	I had to stop him from playing it
B	cos I
A	yeah
B	and play like
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	I can't believe you haven't tried it plugged in
B	well I researched about that and it's really about the quality of the amp
C	oh right that's
A	yeah that would depend
B	like that shop
C	yeah they're rubbish
A	yeah
B	they're not doing themselves any
A	by using that amp
B	but it's the same in
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	but there
B	just thought it's a quiet shop I'm not rushed
A	yeah
B	in
A	yeah
B	there's there was an older bloke who's in a band he understands
A	oh right the the salesman?
B	yeah
A	oh that's good
A	I love the trees on the turn this time of the year do you?
B	it's nice yeah so
C	yeah
B	but Ivan S is a good make
C	yeah
B	and then I tried one just below that as well which I didn't
A	do you
B	a massive reputation
C	yeah definitely
A	do you want it putting on the music insurance?
B	yeah
C	hang on with my Musicians' Union membership I might be able to get it cos you get insurance up to two thousand pound in mine
B	we'll have to look into it properly
A	yeah cos I might be paying over the odds cos I'm already paying on Allianz for
C	ah yeah that's
B	I think the music union covers the instrument doesn't it?
C	yeah but only to two grand so it'll be no good for my fiddle but we could put
B	right
C	put the guitar in
A	oh you could put the guitar on on erm
B	I might
A	that one the
B	what I might get see if that
C	well as well we'll discuss that later cos I think that's wrong
B	cos the problem is
C	well then you'll have to sort yourselves out won't you?
B	alright now that's why
C	you know?
B	we'd need something else as well
C	oh right well we'll discuss that later we'll see who's right later yeah?
A	I would just get the guitar insured though
B	yeah
A	you see I I can get you that for thirty pound a year
C	I can get it for nothing a year you see
A	oh in the with the Musicians'
C	yeah
A	Union?
B	can you turn the heater down a bit
C	yeah it's I'm shattered I really am
A	well why don't you

C	so this is
B	yeah so
C	yeah
B	had you been to
A	before what?
B	when you went with
C	had you?
A	I think er everyone's driven to it
C	do
A	yeah
C	really?
A	uhu
B	where did
A	what do you mean?
B	well you know like er Middlesbrough people probably got to like Thirsk?
A	what?
B	as an ultimate reward you know seems the best place
C	Tow Law if you've been bad
B	yeah Tow Law as well
C	Palace Green
B	what would heaven be?
C	Durham Durham
A	Durham yeah
B	Durham
A	Durham Palace Green the cathedral square yeah
C	where do Teessiders go
B	they stay in Teesside
A	South Bank South Bank
C	oh their rival
B	no it would probably be Surrey wouldn't it if you look at it properly
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	then it's you move up to Darlington
B	is there a rivalry between Darlo folk and
A	no
C	they're so geographically near but
A	if they've
C	removed
A	no people from Darlington go shopping in Middlesbrough they think it's just on their doorstep
B	cos they all support Borough don't they?
A	well they
C	really?
A	Darlington never ever drew a large crowd
B	no they
C	how many people did it draw?
B	doesn't does
A	they reckon there's a solid core of two hundred
C	two hundred?
B	two thousand
A	no a solid core that like gave their weekends up to raise money to try and save
B	oh right
A	the they the rest can take it or leave it
B	really?
A	that's why that's why they disappeared
B	that's a bit like Carlisle except the Carlisle ones
A	no Carlisle
B	there's more glory
A	have more
B	if they do well
A	Carlisle have always had more
C	mm well actually
A	like Darlington have never had
C	well
B	yeah like if I had lived there I'd start going if they were doing well
C	like Middlesbrough have got a lot of them like they have about fourteen thousand do a solid people who go even when they're not doing so well and then about
B	yeah
C	ten thousand
A	yeah ten more
C	further
A	yeah
B	soon see that drop off if they were in league division two
A	yeah they would drop off
B	they'd go down to three or four I reckon
A	no I think
C	yeah
A	they they've got they have always
B	or five
A	had more Middlesbrough have always had more
B	they went down to five six thousand when in the eighties
A	did they?
B	when football attendances were low Man U were
C	yeah
B	getting
A	really?
B	thirty-five thousand
C	hooliganism and everything yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but what about nineteen what's on their badge? nineteen eighty-six or something
B	yeah well that's probably when they
C	that's when Steve Gibson bought them yeah
A	oh is that when they were starting to rise
C	when were football crowds at their biggest then? seventies or what?
B	now
C	really? now?
B	yeah now
C	even though it's seated?
A	but but a lot of
B	yeah
A	people today are are they're wearing er protest T-shirts and holding placards against ticket prices
B	yeah they will be yeah
C	yeah cos in
A	I think it's
C	Spain and Germany they're so cheap aren't they?
A	I think it's this Saturday they're doing it
C	that's why Spain and Germany
A	it's every
C	get such big crowds cos the prices are so
A	there's
C	small
A	more money in the grassroots stuff as well the the erm all of the Premiership and
C	you couldn't really get more money in English grassroots mummy
A	evidently it's poor
C	everyone plays
A	most of no but most of our kids have to pay to play whereas if you were in Germany
B	I don't I don't tend to
A	and you can just
B	believe Germans any more
A	you can just turn up
B	I don't believe Germans any more
C	what happened?
A	well that's what she told me
B	Volkswagen
C	oh yeah
A	oh have you chatted to him?
B	he wasn't surprised
A	when did you talk about it?
B	last Sunday

C	yeah
B	the sale the guy who was the selling the guitar said they get better with age
A	oh
C	oh yeah?
B	and I was like I don't know whether I could believe that
C	no I was gonna say
A	well violins do must be something to do with the wood
C	some of them do
B	yeah but this is still a budget guitar
C	yeah
B	top end of the budgets
B	no no
A	bless you
B	semi
C	yeah serious people
A	were you having erm a try of a few different models?
B	yeah
A	were you tempted by any other?
B	no
A	did that one just stand out?
B	yeah it was the first time I've played one and I've played a lot of the other stuff around that price
A	yeah you have
A	where do you plug it in? at the bottom end or the top?
B	I don't know I didn't look
A	is that not crucial?
C	no
B	it doesn't really matter
A	I thought
C	like whether
B	yeah I know that's what I thought
A	so you don't know where you put the erm the lead?
B	yeah I have
C	it'll be somewhere
B	I I've plugged it in there I did it
A	I just wondered whether it came out of the bottom end or
B	I think it does yeah
A	how did you start that was easier
C	the controls will be
A	yeah
C	the controls will be by your left sort of out shoulder will they?
B	yeah
C	but you can change the volume if you
B	oh no you can get to it there's two buttons
C	is there not a control pad?
B	there's two
C	oh what kind of pickup is it?
B	fish something
C	Fishman? yeah they're
B	yeah
C	the best ones
B	yeah
A	are they?
C	yeah
B	yeah I
A	had
B	researched it all
A	had
C	no Martin
B	and he he says you won't get a better guitar
C	yeah I'd say
B	but
C	seventy percent of professional guitarists use Martins
A	cos he played for a lot of years
B	he he said if you got
A	well he'll know because he's been in a lot of bands
B	he says you can spend a lot more
A	and managed bands hasn't he?
B	and just get the same and he said er the only other thing for me to do is do what he did go round a lot of second hands
A	oh right
B	cos he got a twelve string for four hundred
A	second hand?
B	yeah which I might borrow if we record
C	no it's
B	yeah just take just to differentiate the texture
C	oh cos when you start getting really er that's what ruined it last time
B	what?
C	you just wanted to
B	I wanted to what?
C	had everything and everything
B	no no I just
C	you'd have the the saucepans
B	her last guitar was er

C	I've come up with something on the fork
A	a fork
B	yeah
C	well when are we going to do my
B	I think we'll record over Christmas how about that?
C	well we can probably start tonight if you've got the mixer or something
B	cos we're just quite good now as a band we're much better than we were
C	yeah
B	I mean you always were but me and
C	yeah
B	in fact we casually played
C	which camera?
B	and I will have a camera holder for my thing so if you could
