C	they used to have those firework displays in years and years ago
A	you mean the big Tesco er near
C	uhu
B	yeah
D	mm
A	before you turn left into Tesco
C	when you go onto
A	oh I don't know where that is
B	big roundabout where the pub is
A	oh yeah yeah
C	and you go left there to go towards
D	and so you go on back to
A	oh yeah is that those flats is that?
D	yeah well they look like they are apartments but on the estate there's erm
A	houses
D	houses yeah
A	I
B	is it a house they're buying or er
D	uhu
B	an apartment?
D	a house
A	I thought you meant you know on the little roundabout where there's like the railway the railway carriage?
D	mm
A	I thought it was on the right but that's
D	oh
A	is that what it's called?
D	what's it called? is it
C	it used
B	it's not called
C	it used to be the
B	whatever it's called
D	mm
D	I can hardly remember that
B	just about
A	why did they swap sides?
D	dunno
C	I don't know why because that side's a big enough plot
B	well it's you know you drive on to
A	right but why would they switch?
B	supposed they wanted a bigger site or something I thought it was big enough as it was I I can't remember
C	I was gonna say it's a huge site
D	don't know why they
B	it's a long time ago
D	I think
C	yeah
D	maybe it was the other way round
B	dunno yeah must have been a good reason at the time must be fifteen twenty years ago I think
D	it's what? it's
B	mm
B	I suppose
A	I I'm I'm
D	do you think one when
B	I
D	I think it's longer
B	I can't remember yeah you might be right I've got no idea
C	I don't remember it
D	I don't think it's well used the space though they've extended it but
C	well they've extended it and then well they've spent a fortune extending it
D	and sublet it
C	and then they've not mm they've not increased the revenue enough to
D	like they thought they would
C	yeah so now they're subletting the space that they spent a fortune
A	how much did they spend expanding it?
D	I thought they'd have sold things like white goods there and stuff
C	sorry?
D	mm no because they made it so much bigger
C	what's white goods?
D	washing machines and stuff
C	oh
D	I know they do that online
C	yeah that would be a better use of the space because they literally did they didn't I don't think they got much new stuff they just kind of spread it out
D	mm
C	you don't like it?
D	no
C	I don't like it I didn't
D	can you not do it
C	oh you've been a while well do you know how far it is?
D	can you not do it online?
C	can you not do it what?
D	could you not do it on the computer?
C	sometimes if an offer's run out as soon as like it look like it says on the ticket offer valid twenty-first to twenty-third and if someone's not taken it off on the twenty-third it's still there on the twenty-fourth someone picks it up thinking it's four pounds it scans through the till because it's
D	oh
C	to the higher price so they've been overcharged because it's been advertised at that price and they've been charged a higher price
D	so you have to go and look at what it's been advertised as?
C	so you have to go and visually like check that they're not just lying
B	mm
A	that'll be me soon
C	you won't it's on customer service desk that they have to do that
D	well if
B	are you gonna go back and do some hours then are you in the summer?
C	hopefully
D	she offered you didn't she?
C	uhu
B	what so just go back and
C	yeah
B	what the woman you didn't get on with? or
C	no as I was leaving
B	okay
C	but it'll all depend what the demand is like the week before that they said they were overstaffed on tills and then the week after they were understaffed cos three people had left that week or do you know what I mean? it changes all the time
B	so are you gonna talk to her when you get back?
C	yeah
D	and take
A	I don't wanna sign anything there and then I'll wanna you know if she offers me something I don't wanna be like yes on er
C	well you'd have to say yes or no
C	you can't say let me think about it really
D	what you thinking about for?
A	I just think I'm gonna be very busy and not be able to enjoy my summer that's what I'm thinking
D	you're only doing seven hours a week
C	I wasn't thinking of getting you like a thirty hour contract
D	think of the money
A	and the money I'm owed
D	and the money I owe you yeah
B	oh right yeah
A	I'm just being truthful
C	if you were being smart you'd work as much as you can over the summer and then you don't have to work whilst you're at college
B	that's probably a good idea isn't it? that's a good shout
C	that's my plan I'm home for the rest of the summer so I may as well get in as many shifts as I can if they need anyone now
D	they might have taken on for the summer haven't they?
B	probably should have had gone and talked to them just
C	probably should
D	there was a lot going on
B	yeah
A	well but I didn't have a chance did I? not really
B	well if this lady likes you then she'll sort something out for you won't she?
