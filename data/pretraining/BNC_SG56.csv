A	oh did you want big?
C	no no no
A	no small yeah
C	that's fine for me
A	yeah
C	apple pie one? yeah
D	you order the tapas for me then cos I don't know what I'm having
A	the er
unknown_female	yeah
C	no well yeah it's just
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	great
A	do you have er Wifi here?
unknown_female	Wifi?
A	yeah
unknown_female	here?
unknown_female	one moment just one minute
D	it's quite good that they've got Wifi on?
C	it's complicated
D	cos erm I was talking to a a a woman who's a business owner in
C	who said that?
D	business owner she's got her business off the ground so she's
B	so
D	got a café
B	did they? oh
D	but and a cookery school no
C	what?
D	she's putting a café in the cookery school
C	right
D	and er I said oh are you gonna
C	but everybody does it
D	what er she goes we don't want somebody coming in and having a cup of coffee and staying for four hours and not allowing me to get more turnaround on turnover on my tables and that's like but really I'm not like that
B	no
D	how many people
C	most people aren't
D	are actually like that?
C	and if they are
D	you can ask them to move on
C	and you can
B	yeah
D	yeah just say you have to
C	kick them out
D	yeah
A	just say
D	I said but
A	you know you
D	but Wifi is for busy busy people on the go
A	business
D	who might have something to email off
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	might need to check something for
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	for whatever reason
A	come and have lunch there with their
D	yeah
A	rather than go somewhere else
D	I think she's
B	and
A	some
B	eat more and drink more?
D	I would have thought
A	people have no idea
D	I would have thought you would
A	no idea
D	you would actually have more
B	yeah I would if there was
D	interested parties
B	I would have thought so
D	coming along
B	you're more likely to have two cups of coffee than just the one
C	and people that are
B	if you're with the Wifi
C	and people that are
D	yeah
C	in
D	and likely to be regulars come back
C	yeah
D	for whatever reason
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	seriously someone who's gonna be sitting there for four hours nursing a cup of coffee won't be your regular
C	yeah
D	because she won't
C	fast broadband
D	for
C	as well
D	yeah
C	so that it's
D	yeah so speeds things up for everyone
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah mm
D	but it's really odd
B	very odd thinking
D	how some café owners don't like the idea of offering Wifi I think it's just that they're being a little bit on the erm
A	tight side
D	yeah
C	very tight
A	yeah but actually they need it for their business anyway
C	yeah
A	so it's just like it's no big deal
D	well I said I said that to her I said if you have a website with all your cookery erm if you have your recipes on your website
A	mm
D	for your cookery classes
B	yes really?
A	yeah
D	you can get them to join up
A	mm
D	to more classes
B	classes well yeah
D	while they're sitting there having a drink
B	I think that's very short sighted very short sighted
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	I think it's the way to go
B	go it is yeah well how much does it cost then? is it a lot of money to?
D	is it a lot of money to have get erm Wifi to offer Wifi in a public area?
A	no cos you're just broadcasting it off your router so
D	right
A	no couple of hundred quid?
D	what a year?
A	well you pay for the connection anyway cos you're a business
D	oh
C	yeah
A	so you're gonna want your connection to run your business
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	what did what about confidentiality is there a problem with that then?
A	oh you just
D	you've got to have it in your business
A	you can you can pay a provider to supply the service
D	cheers
A	or you can set it up so you're gonna need the IT guy
C	cheers everybody
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	to do that
C	cheers
A	but you just set it up
D	chin chin
A	all up on a
A	separate thing
C	that's a nice long coffee
A	but you don't have a connected to your own personal
B	so so that wouldn't be a problem then the confidentiality bit then? because that's not
C	well it's if people can break into it
B	cos you wonder
A	doesn't matter
B	if it's something to do with that and if
D	she didn't mention it if it was
B	no so it wasn't that then
D	she just said
A	she she just has a block
D	she doesn't want someone to sit there for four hours nursing that
C	not many people
A	well you just tell them to move on
B	that's what erm
D	well very she's quite she's quite an astute businesswoman
C	yeah but not
D	she hasn't quite got her head round that bit yet
C	no
B	how old is she?
D	about
B	oh so she's not
D	something like thirty-six thirty-seven something like
B	you see I thought maybe if she was my age I wouldn't have I you know
D	no no
B	might be a bit more reluctant
C	no no
D	but you know much more than you know
B	so actually
D	if she comes round
B	yes
D	yeah
B	or how long she lasts if she's
D	well that's the thing
C	oh there you are now
B	oh lovely oh
B	doesn't it? yeah
D	I like the beer
B	beer
C	I really like cold beer
D	I actually said that in the Spanish the last call
D	yeah good
A	oh good?
D	that's a good beer
A	good

B	I like when she went like that it's really quite hard but it sort of
D	did it away got away from you?
B	I'm upset cos it was very nice
D	oh

D	for what
B	whereas you go to
D	yeah
B	Lidl and Aldi
D	yeah you come out with a lot more
B	and you get a lot
D	yeah
B	but in Tesco's you don't like
D	mm
B	and I even went to Asda a few weeks ago to be perfectly honest that was expensive
D	mm
B	like how it used to
D	mm
B	and the poor quality
D	mm
B	of stuff
A	the their that's that's the
B	oh
A	big thing I notice is the quality of stuff
C	yeah
A	you're getting
C	yeah
B	horror
A	it's just pretty bad actually erm
C	they're pushing for price all the time
A	yeah

B	but it's good quality
A	well I don't don't care whether it's brand names
C	no
A	it's just good food
C	yeah it's good quality stuff
B	because it's German isn't it or something? cos
C	yeah
B	they won't have
A	mm

A	mm mm
B	I think what you get from there is wonderful really
D	mm
C	yeah

C	oh
D	but I don't know what I don't quite know what they are
C	they could be
D	they could be
D	they're quite yummy

A	mm
B	you wanted new shoes didn't you? you wanted

B	I know
C	yeah

A	that's squid isn't it?
D	I think so
C	yeah

C	yeah
A	I think
B	it's a long time until tonight
A	since I've hung out with you guys I've been eating twice as much as I normally do
B	doesn't surprise me a lot of people say that when they hang out with
B	that's why we're not
C	ah
B	size sixes
C	it's an appreciation of
A	appreciation and well
D	mm
A	well when you get an opportunity to like this
C	without no so
B	mm
A	for a
C	wonder what time
B	don't know I'll have to phone

C	Friday is it oh they're having a long one
D	oh that's good
B	I'm not sure
A	mm
C	mm
A	but it's always quite good for a
D	it's a nice yeah
A	lunchtime beer
D	a light lunchtime
C	mm yeah it's a light
D	erm beer
C	yeah
D	doesn't really feel like it sort of tastes like feel like you're drinking beer in a way
A	mm
C	yeah
D	so your erm Spanish teacher is she gonna continue with you when you get back to England or?
A	who erm
D	or is it just in front of a?
A	who
D	yeah
A	from Peru?
D	or
D	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	I erm
D	so you teach her English and she teaches you
A	yeah and and also I'm kind of being her erm sounding board for her business thing
D	right
A	so so she erm
C	mm
A	and you'll know the meaning of them by association with English words
C	yeah
A	that is
D	false friends
A	false friends but they have
C	yeah
A	false friends
C	yeah
A	so
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	and they by taking that approach you can get yourself in a bit of trouble
A	so
C	mm
A	of four minutes playing off these different false friends against each other
C	uhu
A	you know?
C	yeah
A	she's got quite a
C	yeah
A	yeah? erm
D	have you shown it to me yet?
A	no no but I can show erm I can probably show you now
C	mm
A	no go to South America
C	yeah
A	and erm so I think this week she was going to hold a just a
C	yeah
A	just to try them out
C	yeah
B	right
A	and then get their feedback
B	right
A	or give her the feedback about you know how can she get improve her stuff
C	yeah
A	so she's making a start on that
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's kind of nice
B	where is she based then?
A	she's in Peru
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	oh
D	what's her internet connection like?
A	alright we Skype okay
D	yeah?
A	yeah
D	wow
A	she's I mean Peru's a bit city
D	right
B	so
A	oh it's through the erm one of our online communities on a
B	oh online
A	on a foundation
C	mm
A	yeah
B	right
A	and she just kind of put out a shout saying she was looking for people who
B	yeah
A	and wanted somebody obviously to to be a sounding board for her business idea
B	mm
A	so
C	oh right
A	and she can get my feedback
C	yeah no that's excellent
D	so how do you teach her English then?
A	well she can teach she can
D	oh okay
B	so how does it go then? she er she'll Skype you
A	yeah
B	and then what? she'll talk to you in English?
A	yeah we usually start in English and just kind of say hi and all that kind of stuff
B	oh right
A	and erm there are different ways to go all about it but erm she started off by just taking some online resources
B	yeah
A	the
B	yeah
A	and then erm
B	right
A	so erm
D	so it's working out for you?
A	yeah in part erm she still goes too complex into like verbs and conjugations and all of that
C	she still breaks in?
A	she she tries to break in and try to correct me and then we get lost down this rabbit hole of her explaining to me why it's this verb and that verb
C	mm
A	me being a tourist just kind of how
D	see the
A	what are my intentions?
D	the thing about it is is that you you know you've got to er decide for the sympathetic native speaker
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	cos quite a lot of the time being stuck is actually how you learn and
C	mm
D	if someone's trying to tell you how to make it perfect from the start
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	but once you've grappled and then secured it it's yours forever
B	yes
D	whereas if you're trying to say something to someone at such a level an intellectual level of a language
C	mm
D	it's nice for about two seconds but after that it actually
C	your mind shuts down a bit
D	doesn't stay with you
C	doesn't it?
D	it doesn't stay with you it doesn't actually become part of you
B	mm
C	no
D	I think that's the only thing about learning a language is that
C	yeah
D	the better language
C	yeah
D	in a way as long as you are able to correct the mistakes
C	yeah
D	and that's the beauty of it is that if somebody is there to help you
C	mm
D	she could just listen to you
B	thumbs
D	not so good
C	yeah
D	or totally not the right word
C	mm
D	and then you can stop and go
C	oh
D	oh have I said something wrong? and then you go through your mind and go oh yeah
C	yeah
D	I just used the wrong word when I wanted to use that one
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	so you learn to self correct
A	mm
D	that's that's another thing you do
C	yeah
D	and that takes skill to get the teacher to know how to
C	yeah
A	well and that's what works
D	it's the learning space
A	that's works with me when I was
D	was that her the other day? yeah
A	yeah she's got some teaching skills
C	mm
A	so then it forced me to start trying to think through rather than just kind of rote repetition and not really trying to associate
C	yeah
A	stuff I would start having a think through okay I wanna say that I went for a walk down here and I went for ten kilometres
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	kind of practical stuff and I found that for me that was a lot better
C	yeah
D	I think so
A	mm
D	it's it's got to be quite a personal journey
A	and people
D	doesn't work and that's why they shouldn't even bother doing it like that at school
C	no
A	people
D	forget about it
A	people learn the quickest
D	it just doesn't
A	by
D	work
A	by doing it and just trying to
C	yeah
A	speak you know? and you will adjust every day
D	you're better off going back to
A	as you go
D	the language laboratories where everyone had their own little kind of cubby hole
B	oh a
C	yeah
D	yeah they could go at the pace they wanted they could
B	yeah
D	slow down when they didn't get something
B	yeah that was
C	yeah
B	quite good
D	they had someone click in and listen play back and say yeah yeah yeah or yeah yeah yeah no go back and do exercise those two again
C	mm
D	come back when you've done it
B	mm
D	and don't even have to from your seat
B	yeah they they don't do that anymore
C	yeah
B	so why did they stop that then?
D	god knows cos it was a very good efficient way because personalised learning a language
C	yeah
D	all of the top people who are like translators interpreters
C	yeah
D	they've come up through language labs you see the Russians that's all they do with them
C	yeah
D	they all that's that is how they learn English or any other language
C	mm
D	they haven't taken them out
C	mm
D	not like we did
C	somebody came up with a new idea and thought it would be cheaper and quicker and it's
D	well it's probably something to do with GCSEs and
B	well we
D	it's all about communication but
B	and we don't take the best from
D	yeah
B	and that's what the
D	yeah
B	get in those positions to be able to say
D	yeah
B	what you can and can't do
D	yeah it's very rare to meet someone who's a
B	yeah
D	policy maker or quite a high up person
B	very very very very
D	who's had any kind of education background
C	well some
B	and that's what we've got to do and
C	some politicians like that
B	and they've got to start it earlier as well is they've got to start languages earlier they dabble a bit in
D	you've got to you've got to get them
C	are you gonna have some more
D	no I'm alright I think I'm gonna stick stick where I am
A	I've kind of had my fill I think
C	I've had my fill
A	yeah
C	I'm just picking cos it's there
A	yeah
B	I might just have that bit
C	go on then
C	do you want some lemon on it?
D	straight in
B	yeah
C	open wide
C	seems a waste of life
D	it does a bit doesn't it? but I find the prawns a bit fiddly
B	mm
C	yeah they are a bit
B	I like with the prawns
A	yeah they get a little kind of teeny
B	when they're like
C	it's good
B	little prawns
C	right that'll do
D	didn't
B	I know
C	well it's good
D	but it's popular isn't there? lots of people are having it
C	yeah
A	mm
B	they're having that as well
D	yeah
A	well it's good for table
B	mm
D	yeah it's a sociable
B	mm
D	way of having a bit of tapas
C	yeah right
D	oh yes please
A	yeah I think so
D	all that oil sitting in me
A	yeah
A	I'll have
C	solo?
D	solo
C	so
D	not being too helpful
B	oh no yeah
B	mm
D	can't can't make out
A	it's
C	okay
C	so that's
C	mm
A	yeah I think so
D	and the other one the Iglesias the the aren't there two sons?
B	we haven't heard about them for ages have you?
D	cos they kind of look a lot Ricky Martin and the Iglesias actually look
B	quite similar
D	I sometimes get them
B	mm I haven't heard from
C	who?
B	recently have you?
C	who?
D	we're just talking about the er the Spanishy type singer type that we would know like Ricky Martin
C	oh yeah
A	or Julio Iglesias
D	Julio Iglesias
C	yeah
A	or his son
D	his son
B	yeah but you don't

D	now I forgot the password there
A	let's cover his face up
C	ah
A	not so good
A	it looked like it had
D	so if you got
C	it was a deep fat fryer
A	now that one looks like a mm
B	what is it?
A	yeah but it was so secret he had to write it down
B	well yeah
A	that's what I like about it
B	thought it was gonna be really yeah
D	sometimes they can be quite quirky do you remember that time when we were in
A	bogan?
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	and then we found out that this canteen that it was actually run by a couple of Aussies it was in
B	oh
D	but it all looked very kind of German
C	mm
D	then when we got the password for the Wifi we were like and we sat looking around our surroundings it was like oh right
D	a bunch of Aussies are running this place
C	mm
D	but they were keeping it well
B	yeah
C	mm
D	it was quite nice erm and erm and yeah the bogan
B	yeah
D	very
A	oh okay there you go
C	yeah
A	yeah a friend of mine is saying erm I wonder if this climate stuff has sunk in
C	geez
D	wow
B	oh
D	that's hot
A	for this time of year in Brisbane
C	yeah yeah
A	that's pretty
B	that is really
C	that is
A	and Brisbane's just like stonking cos it's inland
C	yeah
B	oh that's really
A	mm
C	do you want another coffee or anything
D	no I'm fine
A	if you're not paying it and you're earning over a certain amount
C	mm
A	they'll charge you more than that
C	ah right
A	so so you
C	so you're better off
A	your cost benefit is actually to get the service it will
C	mm mm
B	oh
D	called
A	and then you get access to a private system but of course it's er it's only for a certain limited amount of things
C	yeah yeah
A	extras cost er cost a lot extra
C	right
A	you know
C	yeah so it's all
A	yeah
C	yes
D	the grounds are planted out with olive carob almond orange grape tree and fruit trees to mention a few
A	wow
D	then there's a well on the property to complement the main source of supply
B	wow
D	one hectare
D	and this was on the ridge that forms the valley that runs down the
A	uhu okay
A	yeah yeah
C	right
A	and how stable is the earth?
A	yeah that's what I was thinking yeah
D	it's gonna be on two hundred and twenty pound sorry a hundred and twenty thousand pounds a hundred and eighty
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	cos they know the owner why would that make any difference?
A	it makes a difference because
C	well they know what they'll accept
A	they know what they'll accept
D	ah
A	yeah
D	right
A	so it's on the market at two twenty
C	it's not a discount cos you're you're friends of a friend it's
A	mm
D	right yes okay
C	it's what they're they'd be willing to
A	yeah and and they even pass comment on saying and maybe they'd
C	right
A	yeah? so if you really wanted to push the envelope you could go
C	oh are you off to Cyprus?
D	why not?
A	why not?
D	yeah
A	oh because I don't really wanna buy a house for a hundred and fifty grand in Cyprus at the moment
D	no that's a that's an emotive kind of reason but if I'm
A	mm
D	looking at it as a business level would you say no?
A	oh as a business plan?
D	yeah
A	well I wouldn't say no until I'd done a lot more research
D	particularly if you're doing an Airbnb kind of type
A	but but
B	yeah
A	you know if if erm
C	mm
A	if if er
A	if the money's linked up the right way without it being a problem then
D	yeah exactly
A	no
D	until you've actually had a proper look at it
A	yeah so
D	you know cos you might be looking at
C	I'd still go to France
A	they've got what? water?
C	water yeah
D	yeah
A	well they I mean they're are the very practical things like that
C	obviously you can drill through the to the dam just
D	I'll be on a plane next month out to Cyprus
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	somebody's got to have a water tank somewhere
C	yeah
D	why is somebody selling this?
C	yeah
C	I did catch his eye about five minutes ago
A	I haven't seen him since it seems his mate's coming out to do that side
C	yeah
B	a hand that's right it does make it a lot easier
D	yeah but
C	you want pudding of any sort?
B	I've had my
C	that looks rather nice
B	it's not pudding
D	have we
C	oh yeah I I have
D	oh we did?
C	caught his eye
D	oh oh
C	no we haven't
D	oh right okay
D	it's obviously getting busy lunchtime trade now
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah we're just going into proper lunchtime now
B	lunchtime yeah
C	what's that?
B	about the house?
D	that yeah ages ago I mentioned to
D	oh it sounds a fascinating country so I mentioned it to her after I'd met them for the first time and I said oh what about Cyprus as a place to
C	mm
D	to to to live for coming back to Europe? and she said yeah yeah yeah you should come and have a look around but come around December January time cos if you come in the summer
C	yeah
D	you wouldn't be able to move
B	mm
D	it's too hot
C	yeah
D	right so I said okay
B	comes
D	comes through
C	ah
D	and I'm like how funny how funny is that?
C	what?
D	cos he won't know any of that
B	but no
C	no he won't know the pre no
D	he won't
C	no
D	he won't know any of that it's like why are
C	mm
D	er sorry in Cyprus a property
C	in Cyprus yeah
D	in Cyprus? why would why would they even consider that's the case?
D	but you still think France is a good bet?
C	I like France
D	yeah
C	and you've got easy landings and
D	well you see the thing about Cyprus is you'd have to live there
C	yeah you would
D	you couldn't do it as a second residence
C	no no no
D	it's too expensive
C	yeah
D	you have to fly to Istanbul
C	what and then come back?
D	and get a flight
C	yeah
D	into
C	yeah
D	into
B	well that's
D	you you know that's it's quite a pricey flight
C	it is
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	now how have they managed to live there for what? twelve thirteen thirteen fourteen years?
C	mm
D	but I guess maybe well he retired
C	yeah
D	and
B	yeah it must be
D	yeah maybe the standard of living's quite cheap out there
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	get on that
D	you can get on that
C	you're straight up to
D	yeah yeah
C	mm
D	yeah you're right
C	that's what I like about it
D	it is really easy access
A	it's easier to
C	yeah
A	getting around
C	and
D	but even Spain
C	it's green
D	you can argue is quite
D	easy access
A	yeah I think
B	I think so
C	oh it is
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah I do like green
B	I wonder what happened to my
C	hills and
B	mind if I have that one?
C	still
B	thanks
D	yeah you're right it's a it's a totally different you wouldn't be able to you'd have to live there
B	yes
D	to make a home there
C	mm
D	well maybe you should buy a place in Spain and I'll place buy a place in Cyprus
D	then we'll run them as Airbnbs and then we'll swap over and
C	we'll just
D	yeah
C	the other person gets on it
A	mm mm
C	come back again
A	I reckon you can just rent a place there
C	well they are cheap
A	if you run your Airbnb thing mm
C	yeah they are cheap here
A	yeah
C	how much do you charge then for Airbnb to do it?
A	it depends on where you are and how the market's going
C	yeah
A	the style or the
D	do you know what's
A	the niceness of your property and
C	mm
A	so on but
D	what's a bit dodgy though? is that in Spain they're not using they've
A	mm
D	when he's been here is that they will use the Airbnb as a way to find each other
C	oh
D	to hook up
C	and then get off
D	as in
A	and then you go offline after that
C	yeah yeah
A	and I'd do that
D	but you go offline so you're not gonna be renting BNB
B	oh
D	and if you were running and Airbnb place
C	well cos like yeah
A	because they're paying for two or three days
C	yeah it's good cos er
D	because they had to be to wanna be there
C	yeah
A	then I'd just cash out and it's a big thing
D	it's probably quite good
C	yeah
A	it's like
C	yeah
A	it was eighteen euros a night to stay in the place I was in in Berlin this year
C	yeah
A	and when we take out their the er the other bit
C	yeah that's right
A	that's down to twelve
C	yeah
B	yeah so what what yeah
A	cos they take fifteen percent off
C	gosh
B	yeah
A	off the
C	yeah yeah
A	off the vendor
C	yeah
A	and fifteen percent off the
C	so thirty percent
A	the renter
C	good god
D	so who wins?
A	so
A	well we both win so
C	yeah Airbnb go out of business
A	the main thing about it is from my point of view I win a lot because there's a big drop in the cost from my point of view
C	mm
A	cos he's getting cash in hand
C	yeah so you're not paying
A	cash is king
C	tax on that?
A	yeah
C	if you got tax on twenty percent or whatever
A	you know? so
D	yeah
A	but you can
C	yeah
A	with it
C	yeah
A	and on big days we didn't charge it out though we charged two hundred bucks a night for New Year's and the days before and after
C	yeah
A	but we could have charged five hundred bucks a night
D	easily
A	some people in Sydney were doing that
C	well yeah cos it's
A	New Year
C	expensive city
A	ten minutes' walk down
C	yeah
A	fifteen minutes to walk to
C	yeah
A	to the bridge
D	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	you know
D	be a good location for that Airbnb
C	ferry crossing
D	it's brilliant
C	yeah
A	anyway
D	we could have moved out of there sublet I mean we got we got
A	oh I went for the
C	yeah
D	oh did you?
A	yeah that's mine
C	oh
A	get your hands off
C	sorry
D	I've just put sugar in there I
A	oh that's the way it's gonna have to be
C	sorry
A	I was wondering why I've got a really small cup I was thinking they're really tight here with their
A	you know?
D	they're really
C	beg pardon
A	cor
B	I never get any
A	mm
D	but yeah we did it with this BNB thing we could have we could have genuinely could have if you'd erm moved out there as a proper well I suppose
B	yeah
D	or you could like walk down the coasts
B	to do it do the
D	to do it for you so she just
B	mm
D	but
B	like that yes
D	they run it as somebody who
B	so it's actually serious if you're thinking about it isn't it?
D	well it's just because exactly and we saw how you could make
B	so what did you do in Sydney the other did you?
D	we had two bedrooms two bathrooms you stayed in stayed
B	yeah where we stayed yes
D	what happened is is that erm in the end oh lovely towards the end of our stay I said to
B	mm
D	I'm working I can't pay for everything so yeah that helped us just kind of keep a little bit afloat and then erm and then we both sat down and said
B	so actually that would be yeah
D	there are businesses to be run I mean like okay say for some reason you're really on the back foot it's like there isn't any
B	oh wow so you do breakfast and
D	mm
B	breakfast or
D	you did whatever they wanted like if they wanted breakfast you'd do it if they didn't want you wouldn't do it but actually
B	yeah well that is a good idea isn't it?
D	yeah it is a good idea particularly if you've got a second bedroom
B	yeah
D	if you know money is
B	yeah
B	might as well might as well yeah
D	they had their own one
B	yeah
D	we had the
B	yeah
C	nice? or too sweet?
A	it's alright
C	no
A	so I prefer it with milk
C	right
A	I don't like the milk
C	ah
A	that's what I find out most of the time
C	right so why not just have a coffee with lots of sugar in it? cut the strength of it
A	I don't like it too yeah
C	café Americano?
A	it gets too full on
C	go for an Americano
A	mm mm
C	mm a
A	it's like
C	well yeah well
A	a lot of these
C	it should just be an espresso with hot water in it
A	yeah
C	I've had arguments with
A	it's actually quite incredible how many people don't know what specific coffee is
C	no but those people serving it
A	well and I think that's where the value of somebody who's really
C	yeah they should know
A	where that value comes from
C	yeah yeah
A	and it's the same as doing a bartender's course or whatever
C	yeah yeah so they know the
A	so you erm
C	yeah
A	it's one thing that's starting to really miff me and that is erm
C	mm
A	cos they want your email address
C	yeah
A	and erm
C	right yeah
A	which is good cos it's just one other button
C	yeah
A	you know? but then that access your accesses your Facebook stuff
C	yeah
A	and all all your mates' email numbers
C	yeah yeah so they all get
A	so everyone gets pinged on but
C	mm
A	hitting it once or having to type in your bloody email
C	yeah yeah
A	and then just to make it extra you've got to confirm it
C	yeah
A	so then you're going and and I sit there and I think why hasn't somebody just created the one button thing?
C	mm
A	for your own personalised email address?
C	no you should be able to yeah
A	so you just go so click by your email address
C	I'm sure somebody has done that
A	bang
C	yeah but these companies aren't using it
A	no
C	I don't think they're using it because
A	no
C	they want the Facebook thing
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and then enter it all and then put your password in and off you went but what a guy in
A	yeah
C	you could do like a three hour
A	yeah so just changing the time that's it
C	hit that and it went straight though
A	mm
C	or you'd put your times in and hit that and it would go through
A	mm
C	it would just do it all automatically and he just did that he was a teacher for some time but
A	yeah
C	it works
A	and there's the beauty of it
C	yeah
A	it just takes out that hassle and
C	yeah absolutely
A	mm
C	what with all the cuts and things but
A	unfortunately I can't remember my password to get into it so I have to pick the Facebook app
C	yeah
A	but the annoying thing is that it
C	oh
A	that on this
C	yeah
A	somehow it signed me out
C	yeah
A	and I wanted it cos this one I know you can download
C	yeah
A	you can choose Mexican Spanish advanced Spanish or
C	oh right
A	so I go with that one
C	yeah yeah
A	it was quite nice I like this one
C	so what's the first one?
