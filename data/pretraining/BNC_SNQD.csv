C	yeah
A	bowl
B	that because
C	I can put
B	are you going to Greece?
A	well nothing is booked but my I did my I was intending to go in September
B	could be a good time
A	cos that's when it's the best
C	oh my god
B	oh fantastic time
C	yeah
B	with a bit of luck the euro will slump even further
A	yeah I'm a bit wary I I don't really wanna go there and be like having a holiday when everyone else like the country's falling apart
C	yeah
B	well no but that you can't think that because your going there is good for them
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
A	but I could just give money to
B	but it's not really falling apart
B	no but when you look at them nobody's nobody's starving
C	oh
B	they look pretty comfortable to me
C	I've put the pizza in but it'll be ready in ten minutes
B	erm and that's just
C	okay
B	okay
C	I have no idea what to think about what's going on
A	I think they did the right I think that was a good thing they did
B	yeah
C	seemed like most of them think it's a good thing
A	I think that's really I couldn't really believe that they like cos they had sort of months ago were trying to get rustle up the money to pay the thing and they tell the IMF they'll cut the defence budget they'll get the money that way
B	great idea
A	and then they're not they weren't allowed to do it by the IMF
B	really?
C	why?
A	cos the IMF are probably lobbied by arms
B	oh
C	oh my god I didn't know that
B	oh oh wait wait are they part of NATO?
C	I don't know
A	I don't think I don't
B	I don't know if it was that it could have just been NATO treaty obligations but
A	I mean even if erm say they've spent massively on arms more than any other European country over the last like over the last
B	really? why?
A	because
B	some other scam no doubt
B	hm?
A	some defence guy from their last government or pre like pre two thousand and eight government is in prison
C	oh my god
A	but they also I guess
B	well they should
A	but that's what people say about Germany cos Germany aren't allowed to spend money on it
C	yeah that's right
A	no weapons and they have the strongest economy
C	yeah
B	that is that is such a bonus
B	and the
C	yeah do they have an army?
C	yeah why did the erm finance minister resign?
A	cos he's like a erm it seems what it is is a way for the prime minister to have more
B	yeah
C	oh I see so he didn't do you think the prime minister made him? he did it sort of
B	it's a good move
A	it's probably his idea since
B	he
C	oh really?
B	well it was a good move he he really
C	he was tough huh?
A	he was calling them terrorists
A	he called the
C	yeah that was
B	yeah he was pretty offensive and they
A	he's cool though did you see the pictures of him like riding out of riding away on his motorbike?
B	looks like Bruce Willis
B	well
C	yeah he'll come back
B	all those politicians think you know okay I'll go off then
A	he's not a politician though
C	that's true
B	oh he's just an economist?
A	yeah
B	oh
C	wow I didn't even
A	that whole that whole parliament is not made up of politicians
C	what's what about the prime minister?
A	the same
B	well they they've
C	yeah this is
B	you know what? you know how everybody thinks that you should pronounce the letter
A	well I if I was reading Greek?
B	yeah
A	erm
B	cos the Greeks pronounce it the way I used to pronounce it
C	what?
B	well they say he says oh he says oh
A	I say
C	okay so it's seven
B	keep your plate
C	forty
C	no we can't go anywhere
B	no this is it we've had our freedom and now we're bound to
C	no but we got an email today and there's some legislation that says
B	oh goody so I can't actually have my AR fifty-one one five slung over my shoulder
C	it it it doesn't happen that often I mean
B	no just
B	like
C	like erm yeah but also in in
B	oh good that's a good American reassurance there
C	Colorado had open gun law
B	I just think it's disgusting
C	I know it's a bummer
B	yeah and then there's this Texas
A	what happens if all the academics
C	well they did the the
B	every
C	university tried to fight it and obviously even the students
B	now now
B	probably he's trying to say that's oh yeah no there's a woman there's woman that didn't a white woman who didn't get into
C	really?
B	mm mm and it's now reached the supreme court
C	well
B	and
C	I think
C	yeah they did away with it some time ago
B	yeah but if you do it just on test scores and all the
C	that's actually
B	oh right
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I do it's ridiculous
C	right
B	trigger warning ah has
A	no it's only in like the English faculty
B	oh the sort of trendy English
A	what just like?
B	trigger warning
C	what is a trigger warning?
A	it's like if there's a lecture about something that if there's a scene in that book where
B	what I like is the fact that they
C	they don't discuss it?
A	they no they do discuss it but as a trigger warning so
C	oh so you have to like flag it before it happens? god I'm so glad I teach philosophy
C	I mean sort of abstract
B	well if you
C	I don't do that anymore
B	abortion
C	yeah
B	think about the Bible the Bible should have a trigger warning cos
C	yeah
B	there's there's murder fratricide straightaway and then there's a whole tonne of incest in the first book
C	can you pass me the water?
B	yep anyway I'd never even heard of
A	it's deuce in the six five
C	really?
A	yeah so you might you just you just lost an advantage point

B	she's erm very forward and very
C	she's
B	she's
C	that's okay though
B	I like that I
C	it's just that she's super-political and
B	yeah the thing is she feels
C	she causes like
B	she feels she has total entitlement because
C	she's black and she's a woman in
B	it's a shame because
C	yeah
B	have a certain entitlement but

A	yeah
B	mm
C	that's amazing Djokovic
A	on a tiebreak

B	great
C	I don't know
B	I don't know
B	so what do you think about
A	erm no
B	you haven't?
C	yeah I don't know what is going on I think that happened to me I actually tried to do it the other day and I got so frustrated
B	what did you think about Charlie Hebdo?
A	erm
B	yeah
A	it's it's always a line where who knows when you're going too far? but
B	I agree but then people
A	freedom of speech is like it's not freedom to offend people
B	well and how
B	well the thing
A	I don't see like why those cartoons
B	if you look at the first amendment of the US confirmation it's pretty absolute it's says really you can say what you like except when it's a direct threat that will
A	we're not in the United States though
B	well no I know but
A	they
C	yeah
B	oh
C	that was my piece
A	I don't know how to get back into like to get away from this
B	it's very very difficult
C	I think that could be a rule of thumb
B	what?
B	I mean if I I'm you know
A	yeah but why does there have to be a law about it?
B	why does there have to be?
C	there doesn't have to be a law but
B	well
C	it would be a nice rule of thumb
B	this book reckons that quite a few of our laws and European
C	oh
B	they violate the first amendment
C	yeah
C	what are your
B	erm I don't
C	what if you say I hate racist rhetoric?
B	yeah well that's the great thing do we tolerate the intolerant? and we have to tolerate the intolerant to make the intolerant kind of
C	oh you have?
B	yeah
C	that's what you've been doing?
B	yeah I've been
B	I'm not wasting my time I'm doing research of course you could research
C	and are you gonna include it in your review?
B	mm mm no probably not
C	yeah
C	what was the first the first part?
B	well I mean you see one of the points it makes it an offence to use threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour that causes or is likely to cause another person harassment alarm or distress but that just puts
C	that's why I think the first
B	when you say fuck
C	the first part of the
B	yeah but you
C	it's not it's what's the I mean read it again one more time? the first part of the class is what's gonna be
B	I mean I'm actually reading his summary of it but I can I've actually got the the law itself as well here
C	insulting I guess yeah hateful
B	well there are some of the things they use
C	yeah that's too vague that's too mm
B	a person yeah here's the rule fear or provocation of violence a person is guilty of an offence if he A uses towards another person threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour or B distributes or displays to another person any writing sign or other visible representation on which is threatening abusive or insulting comma with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him or another by any person so it's quite a heavy qualification in that
C	yeah it's not bad
B	immediate unlawful
C	it's pretty good yeah I mean if they
B	yeah no they do
A	Djokovic broke him
C	yeah you see that's the thing about Djokovic cannot
C	he's tough I think he's the toughest the mentally toughest one
B	yeah I think he is
C	yeah but he
B	he's always recovered
C	you can't tell if he's actually faking it or
B	oh no then you remember then immediately he starts sort of limping and
C	I know yeah yeah it's true
B	sort of pretending he's not well
C	it's like he's injured
B	he's just such a
C	well that wasn't a one of our best suppers ever
B	I thought it was great when
