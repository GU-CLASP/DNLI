B	D'you think so? But it's settling on there
A	uh
B	yeah
A	pavement no
B	is it not?
A	I don't think so
B	that bit's like the white bits obviously
A	well I can see
B	yeah that's what I mean
A	it's settling on the gravel but it's not settling on the road or the um uh pavement
B	on the path or anything
A	I don't think it'll be
B	I know
A	there there is a lot of soil outside but uh um
B	yeah but number one the soil'll be totally
A	because it is sort of not it's  not it's  just sort of
B	but it'll be totally frozen now though
A	or d'you think the soil will be full of sort of uh like
B	bugs and stuff
A	too many flies and that or
B	maybe
A	Cos there is quite a lot of soil outside
B	this thing came from the garden centre
A	well oh well spotted you're making use of the uh numerous things that come through our letter box

A	she's trying to you know curry get it his favour
B	waay
A	um
B	well
A	not only did she just give him a curry but uh
B	well
A	um
B	yeah cos they realize they're like really critical
A	yeah
B	and then like come unstuck when it's like their the you know when it's their time
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but you ultimately the game's won and lost often by generous people versus not generous people like
B	oh you mean when to give them one point?
B	yeah
A	ay?
A	have you seen the amount of nicknacks and that? The guy said it was like a Pound Shop
A	yeah yeah she likes uh

A	it's spelt S A L S A like that
B	so you know like the dip saltsa? Are you saying that that is
A	salsa
B	so that's supposed to be salza as well?
A	salsa
B	I think you're just
A	say salsa
A	say say sal
A	say sal
B	no
A	you won't say sal?
B	it's just regional variation you're supposed to embrace it
B	yeah exactly
A	um
B	you're supposed to
A	D'you remember what that picture is in in their uh
B	dunno but there's just like a really bizarre collection of things
A	it's like a wicker it's almost made out of wicker
B	it is very much uh like a grotty B and B isn't it?
A	ay?
B	it's a grotty B and B isn't it?
A	it's a B and B for stag and hen parties it's supposed to be
B	look at that it's like a fake sort of beachside bar
A	uh
B	no but it's like
A	but you don't wanna have anything too uh you know precious in there do you on a stag night uh or
B	no that's true
A	I was  I was  invited on a stag night to to York
B	can I rub that off?
A	uh
B	uhuh
A	which was really good
B	or
A	uh uh which would've been really good but but I couldn't uh couldn't really afford it so I I sort of uh
B	oh you're not
A	but uh couldn't go but uh it was quite a big
B	oh I hate them
A	if you
B	I don't know if it's like
A	you were with uh
B	I went on
A	oh right yeah
B	well I went on
B	uh but
A	uh put put the um radio on something or just turn the sound off yeah
B	is this the one where? Alright
A	turn the sound off
B	alright
A	um
B	yeah
A	it's not always family and friends is it because
B	no just different groups of friends like
A	it depends on it depends doesn't it I mean
B	yeah
A	um
B	it's supposed to be like your last night of freedom isn't it?
A	um but well that's the
B	and like strippers and like inflatable body parts and just bad bad crack
A	there's there's a few things where it's just it's sort of too uh too much attention maybe and you're sort of
B	yeah
A	uh sort of forcing people to um do things that they normally wanna do like
B	ah cos like at Helen's hen night there there was a theme and the theme was sexy sailors
B	no no it was a sexy
A	but this was for women for female sailing cos
B	yeah but there's no such thing
A	how many female sailors are there?
B	oh
A	oh right excellent
B	it'll be from your mam won't it?
A	um
B	you do I suppose
A	I mean you do now but like not traditionally and
B	no
A	if you think of a sexy sailor you gonna be thinking of like a sexy male sailor as well
B	and like that's like a gay thing like isn't it? It you say that
A	that's
B	who
A	no the person who's idea it was to to have that theme
B	ah the
A	it might might
B	chicken chicks
A	yeah
B	that doesn't even make sense
A	Cos it's not just like a normal party uh I mean or fancy dress party it's
B	I know
A	because you've gotta go out you obviously it you're sort of risking seriously permanently embarrassing yourself
B	that's really bad
A	yeah
B	and I think as well they're always like really extravagant like loads of um really far away or like Yeah we're gonna do a cocktail making class then we're gonna go on a spa day then I'm gonna have a facial
A	yeah
B	like or not as in the case of Helen's wedding
A	we were um
B	yeah I did
A	I
A	uh uh oh well it says Hi uh had a
B	last week in August
A	um so I think she means that's the only one where Lisa and that are going
B	are
A	I dunno I mean
B	is that all she said?
A	well it's just one there's some text missing
B	oh right
A	I will some text missing
B	Will they is your mam and that going as well or not?
A	my mum?
B	aha
A	yeah yeah she'll she'll probably be
B	so
A	like um
B	August bank holiday okay well
A	uh
B	right well
A	like a more Easter sort of way
B	but we haven't got any plans for then have we?
A	not really well
B	we don't need to go at Easter
A	but then I mean Easter is a bit as well actually they they're the sort of big ones that
B	it gives us more time to save money though cos like actually Easter's a bit close to um
B	I'm gonna check on the calendar
A	uh yeah so we might be able to go around in uh
B	oh you're putting the wet things on the door
A	sorry
B	oh look all me  all me  little post-its have gone all
A	uh well
B	no
A	it'd still be the same afterwards uh
B	yeah I've got the day off before the August bank holiday
A	alright so that's a possibility then that one
B	what d'you mean?
A	we're more flexible than than that I mean
B	no but what's not this
A	perhaps
B	yeah but we
A	no I'm just I I don't I you know it's uh
B	I mean August bank holiday is is bit gonna be as busy as Easter so
A	uh I I don't mind I I mean
B	but but so's the Easter one like
A	um fair enough yeah
A	well I didn't
B	well maybe there is you've only got half the message
A	yeah alright she'll check the um uh check the exact dates and get back um they're pleased uh they're pleased that we're going
B	aha
A	well
B	we kinda have to now we've mentioned it
