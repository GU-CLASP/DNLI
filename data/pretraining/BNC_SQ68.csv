A	so how
B	er yeah I had double English lit and then
A	oh wow
B	so
A	yeah
B	we were doing
A	oh great
B	so the book is on its way isn't it yeah?
A	it is yeah
B	yeah
A	oh the Sylvia Plath the yeah?
B	yeah cos I've got that already as well
A	oh yeah of course
B	that would've been good but
A	yeah when did you get that was that a couple of years ago now?
B	no
A	yeah I know yeah it was
B	it was
B	a
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos there was one year we we did get you lots of books for your birthday didn't we?
B	yeah
A	and I think that was one of many
B	oh right
A	or was it Christmas? maybe Christmas
B	I
B	oh yeah
A	ah
B	because I remember putting it on my bookshelf and I'm sure you'd just given it to me in the doorway but maybe not
A	oh yeah let's go with that one yeah I'm just always like yeah inundating you with books
B	erm
A	have a book have another book yeah
B	that would nice wouldn't it?
A	yeah
B	and then
B	yeah so we're doing that
A	yeah
B	I was looking at erm
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	well you know what it is you know all these millions of different Post-it notes that you've been acquiring
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	quote on this theme and I'm gonna use lots of highlighting and
A	yeah
A	right
B	or characters
A	I saw that you did that for your timetable actually you know you sort of colour coded
B	oh yeah
A	but yeah
B	yeah I did
B	colours highlighters excellent
A	yeah that's the way to go
B	yeah so we were doing that and we had we had a different teacher today
A	oh did you find out from uncle
B	it was
A	it was just a
B	and I have got an English teacher called
A	ah
B	so I'm presuming it's her
A	so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	mm
B	morpheme and
A	who phemes?
B	morphemes
A	well I I've heard of morphine you know but not morphemes
B	and like
A	what morphemes two separate words or?
B	no
A	I've not heard of that before
B	is the smallest unit of language you can have
A	oh right
B	it's like
A	right
B	instead so it has a meaning but it's the smallest unit of language
A	oh wow oh well you
B	yeah
A	you'll be able to er impress grandad with all of that or certainly uncle
B	that's a good idea
A	yeah
B	I feel that like grandad would know about all of that
A	mm mm
B	yes
A	oh yeah
B	like whether we should just be like this is how you use grammar or
A	mm
B	and we also watched this documentary
A	mm
B	on this Amazon tribe
A	oh yeah?
B	and they have this really weird language that they can whistle and hum as well as speak it
A	oh
B	yeah it's interesting but there's only three people in the world who can speak it
A	outside of the tribe you mean?
B	yeah outside of the tribe yeah
B	there's only three people who can speak it outside of the tribe
A	oh right?
B	and erm
A	mm
B	and er he he's saying
A	right
B	or a past or future tense
A	oh that's interesting I'm sure there's another erm
B	mm
A	or future
B	but
A	yeah
B	the thing is there's this guy who's like the father of modern linguistics and he's made
A	right
B	that he thinks there are these grammatical rules that are inherent
A	mm
B	in humans
A	yeah
B	you can keep adding
A	mm
B	clauses to sentences
B	but in this
A	uhu
A	can speak it
B	so you know
A	yeah let's the other two people on board too yeah
B	but but now they're all being modernised and it's really sad
A	oh er so are they Amazonian did you say?
B	yeah
A	so because of all the terrible sort of logging that's being done with the Amazonian Indians and
B	well not they
A	no?
B	they've had people going in installing a school and a health clinic and things
A	oh I see
B	that's a bit more positive
A	right okay
B	but it's still like
A	yeah
B	cos they're
B	erm
A	oh yeah you said you were going to
B	yeah
A	cos they're quite a small group aren't they?
B	er yeah
A	yeah
B	so there was erm
A	okay
B	he's very nice
A	yeah
B	home educated and there was another girl whose name I can't remember
A	which was that one now?
B	the one who sat with us at the thingy
A	oh yeah she was lovely yeah
B	yeah I
B	see if I can seek her out another time
A	do you know what she's studying?
B	sociology psychology
A	mm
B	and something I don't remember
B	but yeah
A	oh great so have you got her contact details?
B	no but I'll probably see her in the canteen one day
A	you can probably bump into her yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	okay
B	yeah they've all gone you know?
A	is there? yeah
B	yeah it's quite
A	I remember when I went to college erm
B	oh right
A	so oh yeah yeah just I mean very erm
A	er well yeah that but er clich√©d maybe you know?
B	oh right yeah
A	inasmuch as like all the arty students you know they're always a bit more way out there with their garb and
A	you know?
B	that's probably what
A	oh there was are
B	but I don't know
A	and all the business students are a bit straighter you know?
B	oh yeah
A	I mean I I actually I was a business student so you know?
B	oh
A	do you think I've developed?
B	you
A	well there we are
B	you you cut a fine figure across your college campus dear
B	yeah
A	and er yeah so you could you could generally tell but that's the thing isn't it everybody's kind of like
B	yeah
A	wearing school uniform and all the rest of it it's just like everybody wants to stamp their identity on
B	yeah
A	kind of erm
B	yeah
A	with very like-minded people
B	yeah I think that's the thing
B	like that that's why so many people are just wearing
A	oh right
B	I am here
A	yeah
B	it's like a walking billboard
A	er yeah
B	I need to get my Sherlock T-shirt
B	I need to get that and just start wearing that around
A	yeah
B	there's another
A	ten Baker Street inclined
B	twenty-two B
A	oh gosh I've so failed haven't I?
B	gosh
A	I've so failed where did the ten come from?
B	ten Downing Street
B	I mean you're making a bit of a confusion there
A	yeah
A	oh dear I'm just so uncool
B	oh it's okay do you remember the?
A	yeah
B	do you remember?
A	just don't tell anyone okay?
B	do you remember the Harry Potter houses?

B	and
A	oh well
A	yeah it'd be Raven wouldn't it Ravenclaw?
B	yes well done
A	yes yes
A	Gryffindor
B	yeah
A	yay
B	well I mean this is popular culture now
B	this is like not knowing who Len Goodman is
A	I
B	well
A	really?
B	there's probably people at my college who have no idea who he is
A	yeah it's a generational thing isn't it you know?
B	gosh
B	oh
A	had been unsuccessful
B	oh you didn't make it
A	my
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh that's not
A	so erm
B	oh emails I'll be erm
A	yeah

B	oh
A	oh
B	proud I'm proud of those poems now
A	mm
B	there's a
A	yeah
B	so I went up and asked her about it and the end and then she was like oh yes you have to do this and I was like
A	oh
B	I have no idea what that is I'm gonna have to ask the person who shoved this poster in
B	my hand
A	oh right
B	so
A	oh she did well to get the news out that quickly didn't she?
A	pat on the back there yeah
A	ah so more competitions that'll be good
B	yeah I need more
A	sort of broaden yeah broaden your outlook there
B	oh yeah should I enter
A	or your
B	oh my god
A	oh is it?
A	what was the theme for
B	identity again same as last year
A	oh I wonder why they did the same again that's a bit
B	that's what I wonder I'm like
A	that's a bit staid of them isn't it?
B	oi
A	yeah
B	it's like how can I write another poem
A	yeah
B	well you can but it's harder
A	mm
B	you know I don't
A	it's good to have fresh themes and ideas isn't it?
B	mm
A	mm rather than revisit
B	although
A	yeah
B	let's look at it from a completely different perspective
A	letely different yeah
B	that might be interesting
A	yeah
B	thank you
A	very broad
B	mm
A	mm I think you
B	need more poetry slams round here
A	yeah well what
B	severely lacking
A	we did
B	oh no you
A	yeah
B	look up in a bit
A	yes I did I did
B	oh we'll do that then in a minute before I
A	ah cool yeah
B	before I go to sleep
A	yahs yahs yeah
B	yeah cos last time their machine was broken when I just had the he was like oh you need to go into the shop next door
B	I was like
B	er what? how how?
A	okay yeah
B	and it's like just go just go and get a top-up voucher
B	I've never done this before
A	but did you?
B	yeah I did and it was fine
A	oh
B	it's not that difficult I just
A	yeah
B	like at the bank earlier oh my goodness
A	oh gosh well yeah that was a bit of a
B	it was
A	but then banks generally are don't you know?
B	yeah
A	yeah it it's just
B	yeah but how did you find about out about the hash
A	the hash key thing?
B	yeah that skips you past the options and then you're like
A	ah right it's just one to remember yeah cos
B	right
A	and er generally most I mean yeah like like most
B	oh right
A	so you can just actually speak to a real person
A	and your bank it's
B	see to be fair their automated system did work
A	the hash tag
B	they just gave me a really weird message
A	yeah yeah well it wasn't very complete was it?
B	yeah
A	it sort of didn't really tell you what you'd been successful doing
B	well no it just told me something else completely and I was like have I pressed the wrong button?
B	but erm
A	er yeah
B	me again
A	yeah mind you they they are massive call centres I know you said that it sounded like
B	yeah
A	you'd spoken to this woman before but it's probably it was the Newcastle call centre
B	mm
A	that erm
B	I do think
A	when you're not used to hearing an accent it can be that way
B	yeah that's right I mean I I probably wouldn't be able to
B	well
A	yeah
B	but the you know the Italian guy in my form?
A	yes
B	we did one of those two truths one lie thing
A	oh yeah yeah
B	where people have to guess what the lie was and one of his things was
A	right
B	and we were all like
B	is he telling the truth?
B	is that?
B	and I was like
B	is er is this Spanish?
B	I don't know
B	yeah
B	that's me
A	it's just that
B	yeah
A	where you start doubting yourself
B	yeah
A	it's
B	yeah
A	it's just like yeah just have confidence in the fact that yeah
B	mm
B	I think mine
A	oh yeah
B	which is true
A	oh yes yes I was
B	er my middle name is
A	yeah
B	which is true I can't remember what my lie was
A	yeah
B	I can't remember
A	did you have to think of it very quickly?
B	it was really
A	did you? no? oh
B	these were like
A	oh right yeah
B	really thought out these lines and
A	concoct yeah
B	and everyone was doing ones where they
B	but I just went with all
A	oh so how many got it right?
B	er
A	right
B	so it's kind of people just yelled at you what they thought was the wrong one
A	ah
B	yeah
A	oh well I hope there are prizes involved
B	no
A	wouldn't it? yeah yeah
B	it was just the prize of introducing yourself to new people
A	oh it was one of those warm-ups
B	do you know?
A	right
B	so I just walked across the room and was like okay I'll be with one of you
B	and everyone nobody else everyone else was like sat still for like thirty seconds so I was just like I'm getting up and doing this
A	yeah
B	so I was with this person who I didn't know
B	friends or one of the people on the boat with you has an injured leg
A	right
B	erm
A	mm
B	what do you do?
A	mm
B	and it was this game of who resorts to cannibalism the quickest
A	oh great Life of Pi all over again yeah
B	somebody was just
B	erm
A	yeah
B	we'll bandage them up with some leaves and then you know we'll go into the forest
A	yeah
B	and then
B	and then and then our
A	yeah take
B	our form tutor was like oh my god you have a heart of stone
B	and then
A	yeah
B	oh and I'm the one with a heart of stone
B	I can't what did we do?
A	yeah
B	I was like we're gonna sort of
B	and let
A	right very good yes yeah
B	everyone was like what you gonna do by dipping them into the sea you're just gonna plonk them there are you?
A	mm
B	what's gonna do? that's gonna be ineffectual
B	it's like no you know cleansing and stuff
A	yeah
B	and then if they don't heal up
B	no wait
B	I think I was like
A	but it was it just before lunch that this scenario kind of took place? there were a lot of hungry people in the room
B	no we were just all ready for cannibalism
B	then erm
A	mm
B	no I think our I think my view was if they die
A	yeah
B	then we'll eat them
A	right yeah
B	but we won't kill them
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	erm and then he
A	was he gonna give them a good burial and all the rest of it?
B	no he was going erm
B	he was going
A	yeah
B	oh and then kind of carried on this like situation
A	bit slapdash really yeah
B	and they were like
A	right
B	and erm
A	oh
B	what are you gonna do?
B	yeah
B	you
A	oh right
B	we're gonna station her as an archer and the rest of us are gonna climb into the trees
A	oh
B	but then somebody else is like we're gonna tie the one with the bad leg to a tree
A	oh his fate
B	far away from our camp
A	his fate
B	and then if they get eaten then we know there was something there
B	if they don't then great
A	just barbaric I mean it's sort of
A	yeah Lord of the Flies
B	yeah it was
A	yeah
