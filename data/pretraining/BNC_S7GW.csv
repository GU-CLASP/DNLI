A	yeah actually when I was erm
B	mm
A	mm
B	but I'm okay because I'm white because I'm here to sort of help the economy rather than hinder it in the sense that I'm helping you know Polish people do whatever it is and learn this necessary skill
A	yeah
B	yeah why am I okay? I don't want to be here if
A	and somebody from Syria for example isn't
B	erm and I've felt like that since this new government was sort of brought in I just think oh I'm not interested anymore so goodbye
A	I think it was there before the new government it was there before the elections actually interestingly one of my students this week started on about the all these Syrian immigrants coming over here raping women and I heard that even before I moved to Poland about erm the perception of particularly Syrian refugees being rapists
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	erm it was also
B	mm
B	and I was like
A	yeah yeah
A	are you sure you want to open that door?
B	so yeah horrible
A	but I also wonder you know how much of an issue is it? because the the general perception that I have from er the woman that I stayed with and from the student was that this is an enormous problem and that it's the majority that are raping people and I you know I don't believe that's the case for a minute and I said to her it's interesting I haven't heard half so much about that from er UK media I've seen a lot on UK media about people being welcomed in
B	yeah
A	a certain focus on it
B	erm so yet two things the first one I read a lovely article from work erm and it was about a er a woman in her thirties who needed a roommate or a flatmate erm and a refugee from Syria who needed somewhere to live er and er the state would pay the rent for him but it needed to be a private landlord and blah blah blah and so he moved in with her erm and you know her family were going well what about all of these you know all of these sexual assaults? and do you not feel threatened? and she was like oh god I didn't even that didn't even cross my mind I was worried whether it would mean that I would have to drink less alcohol in case he was offended or whether you know he would be offended if I was eating like bacon on a Saturday morning
A	mm
B	yeah you know erm so and it
A	mm
B	yeah and he's gone to er he's gone to he went to her family's house for
A	mm
B	so it was just really a lovely read
A	yeah I I guess
B	mm mm mm
A	yeah yeah that's lovely
B	yeah I will try and find it and send it to you but it was really just a nice thing to read
A	mm I think the bottom line for me is people are people and I think all humans wherever they are want the best for themselves and for their family and first and foremost that means a safe place to live where you are warm you are comfortable you know you've got shelter you've got food you've got community you've got relationships you know you feel part of something bigger than yourself perhaps be that family or community or whatever and
B	yeah
A	mm
B	how can you feel so strongly against Muslims as a whole if you've never met anyone who is not like you white? I just don't get it it just doesn't even like register in my brain I just don't understand how you can have these sort of preconceptions like so er
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	of mainstream media manipulation
B	but at the same time the people who voted for this political party and this party who have got the majority vote the
A	yeah
B	no but I think that's the like the the voter is that person
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I'd expressed that when I had a trip to England actually it was before Christmas it was before
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah abhors everything that Cameron stands for
B	yeah absolutely it was
A	yeah
A	I know it really pulled me up short
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you go oh bloody hell no they don't it is just that I've just handpicked this group of friends to be around and we all have a similar interests but the rest of the you know the country isn't like that I was like how weird is that?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's a lot worse
A	yeah to an immigrant and refugee-hating country instead so
B	I don't know I just think wherever you are gonna encounter these problems and as bad as
A	yeah
B	slippery eels
A	yeah I do wonder though historically or if we sort of look back on this time of I suppose for me Thatcher and Reagan were the beginning of the end they were the epitome of everything that sucks they kick-started the sort of neoliberal capitalism that's brought the world to its knees really but I do wonder if you need a certain amount of that selfishness before the rest of the world goes hang on a minute
B	yeah
A	yeah I do wonder if you know this particular form of capitalism and this particular form of ho ho democracy has reached as bad as it's gonna get and it's just gonna fall in the coming years maybe five years come in ten years will it last that long? but I do think sort of economically socially and environmentally the world is on its knees now something has got to give
B	mm
A	I find it exciting rather than frightening
B	I think it's took over
A	yeah I do I think it's an amazing time to be alive
B	it can only get better
A	yeah I guess so
B	mm
A	yeah
B	even it means unlearning everything that you know
A	yeah
B	mm yeah
A	a lot of which particularly in this country people would have been brought up with with a very heavy church influence heavy influence of dogma I do come back to a lot I do think organised religion has a huge amount to answer for in the world that we see today
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah
B	no she hasn't to me
A	I think it it sounds like it is not very well paid so she might want to reconsider going to England
B	yeah
A	that's true
B	so
A	I think the Polish teachers of English don't get paid even as much as the natives
B	twenty twenty-five
A	Jesus
B	my friends last year they were it was their first year teaching at
A	wow
B	mm yeah because it was their first year and if you are teaching kids in elementary and your language level is lower you don't get so much whereas if you are up there teaching like proficiency and CAE you get paid more because you've got to have a better level of English but you've got to work through the system and it always make I always question like why
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and you don't aspire to earn more you don't need to earn more you love what you do it doesn't matter
B	and the lower levels you teach the earlier that you finish whereas when you teach the highest levels you finish later
A	mm
B	yeah and if you have got a family or you just want your own time then
A	yeah oh I keep meaning to ask you I've given all of my students notice that I'm stopping teaching at the end of February do you want my private students? sixty up to an hour forty-five for forty-five minutes
B	mm
A	no
B	or just chat?
A	chat
B	do you plan anything that you are going to do?
A	a little bit erm I've got erm
B	mm
B	phonetics oh
A	yeah but others just write it as they'll remember it and understand it and they take that sheet away with them so all I'm doing throughout the lesson is on the spot correction if it feels appropriate if it doesn't feel appropriate just note note it for later it's easy it's easy money
B	mm
A	hey that's cool
B	but I really liked it when you said this
A	that's a good idea
B	but yeah new vocab as well because they just tend to write write it somewhere separate but if I have it in in an organised way
A	mm
B	yeah
A	so as the lesson goes through I'm just jotting things down but really we were talking about everything I mean they are all sort of my age or thereabouts so we talk about music and about things that I don't know
B	yeah
A	yeah never short of conversation with this
B	I'm really lucky with my one to ones I hated one to ones last year I used to really dread them er but I've got a fifteen-year-old boy who just is happy to do whatever whenever he wants er I've got this girl who's erm doing her medical interviews so it's just every week going so how do you feel about euthanasia? talk for eight minutes
A	mm
B	I was like this
A	is this the one in Aberdeen?
B	abortion how do you feel? yeah
A	have you managed to get her to express an opinion yet? because you were having trouble with that
B	no she's fine she's fine at everything yeah
A	oh good good who's the one you had difficulty with one of your students expressing an opinion?
B	oh yeah the daughter the daughter of my other one to one erm and she just who what music do you like? I don't know what do you mean you don't know? come on
A	but if you did know who would you like?
A	opinion well done yeah
B	I can deal with that it doesn't have to be true it just has to be words in English in a row
A	yeah
B	even if the words are the wrong words in the wrong order as long as your your mouth is making a noise
A	yeah it's all a vaguely coherent sentence yeah
B	and the woman I had last night this fashion designer woman all we are doing and we have been doing it for two weeks is reading an article that she printed off on the internet about the next biggest trends I was like by the time we finish this article these
B	and it's like it's like a game-changing coat and it is just like
A	yeah it's bespoke
B	it's a really nice coat
A	yeah
B	yeah so it is just
A	oh god
A	so you managed to get her to speak in the lesson to be about listening and reading comprehension nice
B	yeah
A	fair enough she is the customer
B	so that's nice
A	good
B	totally fine
A	they were getting pretty fun yeah
B	yeah they are okay
A	still good?
B	yeah it just depends on the topic
A	oh what did you do with your two young people who were running riot? your feral children?
B	they are still feral
A	oh god
B	I go like do what you want but only not now
A	yeah is it just them?
B	er I had five last week all little boys
A	yeah oh god
B	they are fine like as
A	yeah
B	I don't want them you know having a conversation about sort of nuclear weapons what somebody had said
B	yes and what do you think about this?
A	I think the same as him because I'm too young to have an opinion for myself
B	well done next moving on
A	Coca-Cola or Pepsi?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I
A	mm yeah
B	it's quite nice in this window isn't it?
A	it's so
B	I feel like a cat
A	yeah a cat
B	you know these cats that are
A	enjoying the window sunshine and it is just yeah really warm but I am getting a little bit too warm now with my vest and my long johns so it might be good to get out into the into the cold
B	right so where shall we go?
A	erm I don't know we need to head back to the van in an hour I can't believe
B	so let's have a
A	mm okay
B	let's have a little mooch around the sort of old town bit and then we will go back to the van because it might take us half an hour forty-five minutes
A	okay
B	well no because we've got an hour and a quarter until we need to go to the van
A	it was five to two the parking thing runs out so
B	mm
