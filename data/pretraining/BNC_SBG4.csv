A	yeah so he got the
A	oh right
B	all about warfare and the wars Cold Wars and that kind of craic
A	yeah
B	my god I'm only slurping tea now
A	long as you don't shupple shuffle
B	how do you get these books off the shelf on purpose?
A	yeah cos you're quite you're just going to get if you forget about
B	it's insane
A	well I was going to talk a bit about
B	oh what are you going to talk about
A	be careful of be careful of that
B	unseating the recording device
A	yeah not knocking it all the time and flapping pages too much
B	like erm gerontology?
A	erm I didn't know that's what it was called
B	yes you did you're the one that told me oh no he didn't sorry isn't geriatrics like? isn't geriatrics treating illnesses relating to oldies eh old oldies old age?
B	oldies but isn't gerontology preventing old age?
A	you've got something on your leg
B	is it still there?
A	no
B	no
A	illnesses
B	sorry what did I say?
A	for old people geriatrics are old people
B	yeah but geriatrics is the study of or is treating illnesses related to old age  gerontology is the prevention of things that come out of old age
A	mm
B	so it's like stopping your age
A	oh I
B	least that's what your that bearded men
A	oh okay
A	you you know you don't have to do all the talking?
B	I don't have to do all the talking
A	soon as
B	like
A	this is my topic though
B	but one thing it says like
A	yeah
B	so instead of application like eventually you're
A	yeah
A	well eventually they run out as well don't they?
B	that's just one thing
A	don't know how how long that's going to be
B	over to you
A	yeah but he was going on about that but it seems that even if we do that I think naturally only puts in like five to ten years even if we erm
B	it helps it's not
A	I thought it was more than that actually yeah
B	but as well
A	yeah
B	his whole theory was that it would be kind of edited didn't say that right but it's like so as long as you get on like first day they add five years then ten years and then they'd keep enhancing those techniques till eventually they'd be adding on hundreds of years and it's like
A	I suppose what you'd hope you'd hope though it's that the thing that got added on to your life like for example telling you you might then die of something unrelated to telomeres so you want whatever therapy
B	but you can always get run over by a bus
A	yeah I know do you think though? cos I was trying to imagine this is something I was also trying to do imagine a world where you could live for two hundred years and what? cos I think if you could live for two hundred years people would value life more but maybe I'm wrong
B	well
A	and we would be more safety-conscious with more care about people
B	well in some ways safety conscious is surely is like I mean even if you went up to a hundred now if you wanted to live to a hundred then I'm going to die at twenty so
A	well I I really when I went to
B	mm
A	one of the things that struck me it just felt like life was cheap life was cheaper people expected to die earlier so people were taking risks that were quite shocking sometimes you know? it's just
B	oh I see what you mean kind of I'll be dead soon so what does it matter?
A	well I suppose they weren't thinking like that I suppose most people just wanted to survive and live as long as they like but
B	well if you want to to coin a phrase literary predictive
A	mm
B	literary predictive kind of model like in science fiction
A	mm
B	if you didn't if everybody could have as much food and energy as they want as much stuff as they had well then you wouldn't have to fight over those things
A	yeah
B	and then you could like you know? devote your time to more purer pursuits and but that's
A	mm
B	so I'm kind of going what the fuck alright for me it's just like it's like when you read about history and you read about all the amazing things that have happened over the last ten thousand years I mean can you imagine being a spectator at all of that?
A	mm mm yeah
B	and like and then if you look at what's going to happen in the next ten thousand years and what you might see and experience
A	yeah
B	on the other side if you're the only one who's living forever then everyone around you is dying or passing away and there's a lot of that's why kind of you need a that's why it becomes very difficult unless you have a everyone else living for a long time but then in another science fiction you've got or if you live so much people get bored and they just kind of want to go out they kind of
A	mm
B	but I think it would be amazing brilliant
A	yeah
B	maybe not forever forever but at least an awful long time
A	yeah
B	no there'd probably be eh kind of for the rich would be living forever but when you think of it like well what's the statistics about?
A	yeah
B	the world is already pretty fucked up like that
A	so you know some people think that telomere is might be the key to ageing in cancer?
B	in what way?
A	stops the process by which cells
A	cancer cells
B	isn't that dangerous cos you could accidentally do it to the rest of the
A	most words?
B	yeah due to the rapid evolution of language no single present day word will have survived a thousand years' time
A	but we're speaking words that have been used two thousand years ago
B	no we're not they're all different slightly if you look at look into like Google and say define word like frippery there was frepe and all French that turned into frippery and then fripper they're constantly evolving and changing a lot of them are have origins of old words but
A	mm so they might be they might be able to understand it or would we be able to understand it? but it just would be
B	don't know did you ever watch that movie Cloud Atlas?
A	yeah
B	do you know they all speak in a funny kind of?
A	that was quite isn't that by that fella? he lives here
B	I don't know but do you know?
A	I reckon he's tach he's tax dodging
B	what?
A	why would he go to live in?
B	why would he live in the wonderful country you're currently living in is it?
A	yeah
B	with with the people who are from that country that you're now just suddenly trashing
A	well I
B	smart move there
A	yeah but why would he move here?
B	why would who move here?
B	what? many people really like this country it can be a bit boring but it's just for
A	mm
B	herself and Matthew whatever his name is
A	mm
B	don't tell but that's an unusual example but there are loads of celebrities who've put houses like tucked away in
A	is it?
B	remember we looked that up I was looking for artist exemption for my amazing tax avoidance scheme
A	oh right
B	but
A	where we were both going to be painters
B	mm
A	still good
B	it's yeah it's amazingly incredible erm legal
B	spin
B	what?
A	no I'm
B	it's it's work well it's it's any kind of work like it can be sculpture oh
B	I know but that's that's
A	really?
B	so it was like just minting it right and but now now it's still that way but I think they actually have to submit tax returns but it's still fucking ridiculous one section of the thing getting off
A	so what else did they say in like a thousand years? is that to show us in the future?
B	ah this is a timeline of our future ah
A	so will it mean
B	you know that comet Hale-Bopp that was around in nineteen ninety-seven?
A	yeah
B	that's not coming back for another two thousand years
A	mm
B	two thousand three hundred so if you missed that tough
B	like
A	oh right
B	here's one that's
A	mm
B	eighteen thousand eight hundred and sixty years from now the lunar Islamic calendar and the solar Gregorian calendar will share the same year
A	I wonder what it would be like actually
B	yeah because we can put all videos on YouTube which are going to be archived and catalogued forever more
A	but do you think they'd bother?
B	not every single one of them but I think it will become more culturally interesting to there'll be video archives of all your ancestors and families going back that's why in some ways social media is very important in a sense if you want to preserve something for your
A	yeah but the only video the only video of me is one doing the Irish games over the hurdling and falling on my face
B	well that doesn't even have a name on it so they won't know but my point is that's why in some ways it's a really good thing and not a narcissistic thing to put stuff up on social media of yourself and your family especially video cos imagine if you're ten thousand years from now or even a hundred years from now or two hundred years from now and you're looking back and go oh my god that's my great great great great great great look at her there talking and like I mean imagine if you could do that for people who are five hundred years ago now like be going wow that's amazing look what they're wearing
A	yeah
B	like
A	but I suppose it wouldn't be amazing to them cos they'd be used to it used to being able to see it as for us it would be amazing
B	no the concept wouldn't be amazing but I still think actually seeing for the first time cos you're not gonna wake up and be a baby and then see all your ancestors going back like a thousand years in one day or anything
A	mm mm
B	mm?
A	though you'd have a
B	yeah you would
A	if you go through your direct line
B	just be exciting
A	mm
B	mm half a million years' time they'll
B	takes a million years for glass to decompose
A	really?
B	I suppose it's photodegradable is it? is glass photodegradable? or is that plastic? probably glass as well sorry it would have finally dissolved
B	I don't know how true this is but it says in five million years' time the Y chromosome will have weakened to the point of crumbling making men impossible don't know what the hell that is but
A	five million years?
B	yeah
B	mm?
A	the Y chromosome
B	is it?
A	yeah it was supposed to be X X and then something happened like an anomaly and that's what made men women were here first
B	in fifteen million years the Mediterranean will have vanished
B	in fifteen million years the Mediterranean will have vanished Africa will collide with Eurasia
A	it's still quite a long time for it to collide
B	mm mm
A	but then won't the water have risen anyway though? so
B	don't know
B	say what?
A	did you know?
B	no I didn't
A	did you know about telomeres?
B	maybe I did
A	but erm do you think they just get shorter through age?
B	I thought it was
A	yeah it's a question not a quiz
B	do they not get shorter the more times you replicate it?
A	yeah but erm people seem to be born with different
B	lengths
A	lengths
B	yeah
A	erm I think newborns have eight thousand base pairs and about three thousand base pairs in adults
B	mm mm
A	and only fifteen hundred in elderly people
B	right
A	but erm this person erm I think she was erm criticised for it she
B	mm mm
A	and erm she looked at chronically ill children erm and their
B	yeah?
A	compared to the mothers who didn't erm and the more stressed they were there was more people who had chronically ill children erm and erm their telomeres became shorter lifetime than you would have expected
B	god it's just so
A	so and then it said that and they said when I I don't know quite how long it took or how bad it
B	god
A	mm
B	so if you're stressing me I should just say get out of my face?
A	yeah I was thinking the other way round actually
B	or I'll die the
A	mm
B	actually
A	what are you talking about?
B	it's too much like kind of data and information
A	what was that thing about living longer though? that looked interesting
A	mm
B	oh my god these are like common
A	oh okay
B	did you see what I did there?
A	went in to
B	no miss conceptions
A	is that supposed to be funny?
B	I don't know I thought it was funny anyway it's Vikings' horned helmets Vikings' horned helmets never actually existed created by a costume designer in the nineteenth century in the Wagner opera
A	you go ahead you go ahead and laugh
A	it's funny cos
B	completely made up
A	did they erm did they have Viking helmets in Viking years?
B	nope
A	was it trying to be authentic do you think? apart from all the naked naked amazing people
B	I would imagine it is I would imagine it is trying to be authentic as any show would try what do you mean naked people?
A	naked lady just taking a very hot bath
B	taking what?
B	sea that was a symbolic thing where she was
A	yeah right
B	wait a minute
A	I didn't think didn't think
B	it was the philosophy that's that's
A	yeah that's what
B	the fact that she was you know? bitchingly hot and sexy
A	amazing good body yeah
B	just completely incidental to be honest
B	oh medieval chastity belts were not anti-adultery devices
A	they weren't what?
B	the
B	there you go
A	bit weird really
A	sharks?
B	yeah
A	no
B	they do
A	like so much that they die I mean bad skin cancer
B	they get
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and when and when I when I talk they're usually probably it's that wouldn't guide the conversation sometimes and not even being responded to
B	yeah what's that?
A	very funny
B	what are you saying?
A	not really very funny at all
B	yeah it's it's kind of like
A	is it the
B	it's it's kind of what is it?
A	it's usually the right ear
B	so hang on I'll coin it well it's psycho selective aural disruption
B	peace out
A	so you could say it in poncy ways is it?
B	mm
A	incredible what do you think the life expectancy was like I don't know erm in classical Greece?
B	in classical Greece for who?
A	erm for everybody
B	er am I going to be shocked? or kind of is it? or could it be something I expect?
A	just have a guess
B	forty-eight
A	twenty-eight
B	fuck
A	see the trouble is this almost all of these take into account infant mortality
B	oh I see so there was tonnes of
A	it skewers loads
B	so basically if there's a high a very high mortality a skewing of the figures
A	yeah
B	but so then like the average people the average age of people who didn't die before five say is probably like fifty
A	mm mm yeah
B	or sixty or something?
A	yeah should be like after the first like couple of years
B	I see
A	mm god I didn't realise like the Palaeolithic times are saying thirty-three but that at age fifteen life expectancy was an additional thirty-nine so it's like fifty-five
B	I see
A	I would have thought some Palaeolithic people live longer I can't quite get my head around them being jumped up that much
B	what? really? what about better medicine? nutrition? shelter? less wars? less
A	yeah but I would have thought some Palaeolithic people might have good shelter and enough to eat
B	that's why it's inept it's not it's not a
A	mm I see
B	for the aristocracy?
A	no for general and then for the aristocracy
B	including mortality rate
A	erm at birth yes it would
B	forty-two
A	thirty
B	fuck
A	that's that's really low for medieval times isn't it?
B	yeah but it's still probably yeah
A	but if you if you were like if you'd survived till age twenty and you were a member of the aristocracy and you were a man
B	mm and you were a man?
A	yeah you could expect
B	cos basically having children kills you
A	I don't know I suppose the figures they got would have been but erm er yeah maybe as well erm from twelve hundred to thirteen hundred just sixty-four years
A	and thirteen hundred to fourteen hundred forty-five cos the bubonic plague
B	I see
A	and then from then time on like around seventy so for ages blokes have been living till seventy if you're you know?
A	I mean they had loads of food and servants and warmer houses and things didn't they? but maybe they just didn't have good medical care
B	mm
A	I wonder what it was? what it was then? and what's the? where do you live longest? which country do you reckon in the world?
B	Japan
A	yeah and which?
B	nailed it
B	oh yeah?
A	I suppose it takes into account infant mortality
B	the what? The Lancet?
A	The Lancet
B	as opposed to The Lancet
A	I was saying I was
B	you're in Ireland you don't have to be posh like
A	I I was actually making a joke
B	oh I see I see that was lost to me
A	yes erm Japanese life expectancy due to
B	fish
A	diet and public health and
B	taking care of the elderly
B	in Japan?
A	yeah
B	they treat women like shit traditionally in Japan in workplaces and things allegedly
A	do they?
B	yeah apparently
A	oh well The Lancet says equal opportunities
B	but it's their diet
A	had loads of fish and that kind of thing
B	god look at all the sugars sucrose lactose fructose glucose
A	you know the oldest confirmed reported age of a human being?
B	a hundred and twenty-one
A	very close a hundred and twenty-two
B	ah god imagine like if I was on some quiz
A	that's very close
B	like for a million euros
A	yeah
B	and I was ah be like that was of some woman was she French?
A	yeah I think so Jeanne Calment
B	Calment the rubbish in my head
A	yeah
B	do you know this thing about diuretics? apparently the diuretic effect of caffeine is offset by the amount of water in the caffeinated drink
A	what? no erm
B	sorry I didn't mean to
A	yeah
B	yeah it doesn't say in the Bible that Satan rules hell
B	but I don't know enough about the Bible but I do believe
A	you're a Catholic
B	I do believe that
A	so am I
B	yeah so
B	withdraw that accusation cos it has no relevance but I do believe that
A	you went to church more than me
B	are the seraphim angels?
A	but he was an angel wasn't he Satan?
B	no seraphim S E R A P H I M the seraphim
A	mm I've no idea
B	they're maybe they're all angels but I just thought the fallen angels were the
A	yeah well at least if eh the the angels fell down went to hell or formed it
B	mm mm
A	I don't know but I suppose it's probably always been there or is it not? was it the Garden of Eden? but then Adam and Eve just I don't
B	angels are not human
A	I know but Adam and Eve there was was a bit like they were saying that everything was lovely and abundant until Eve ate the apple that's when all the rot started
A	yeah I was I was wondering what it has to do with that cos it's like a thing over hell
B	oh I see I think it could be something the seraphim well you know? maybe seraphim were fallen
A	mm
B	or when they were cast out down to walk the Earth forever I could be mixing up a whole load of crap probably in fairness
A	do you know who John Sperling is?
B	John who?
A	John Sperling
B	how do you
A	or was
B	as in
A	S P E R L I N G
B	Sperling?
A	Sperling
B	John Sperling give me a hint
A	he had loads of money
B	he had loads of money?
A	yeah
B	that's a that was that wasn't a hint that was terrible
B	but eh
A	he's a businessman a businessman
B	did he do something?
A	erm he founded a like a
B	mm
A	and which is now part of an Apollo Group
B	to get away from the mother
B	uhu
A	erm and then he got a degree and Masters that kind of thing
B	sorry what?
B	how long would it take one person to make the Great Pyramids?
A	that's funny
B	mm mm
A	thousand years
B	four million
A	oh my god
B	apparently
A	they had they had loads of slaves didn't they?
B	obviously they have like you know a very
A	yeah but anyway this bloke he put loads of money into erm immortality cos he believed he wanted to be immortal as well like you
B	mm mm
A	but unfortunately he died erm I bet he's I bet he's got to get his brain his head frozen
B	see yeah er well
A	oh
B	so like then you'd nanites as well to replair repair all that shit as well as defrosting and things but
A	mm
B	that's why I'm more going maybe for just some kind of quick
A	yeah
B	just has to be kind of hermetic is that a thing?
A	he spent twenty million dollars trying to clone a dog called Missy
B	mm
A	seven years
B	and what was the point of that?
A	god the project was called Missy Missy
B	erm okay but what was he trying to do? what was in it for him?
A	I don't know because maybe it was his dog anyway was supposed to put a loads of money to immortality research that kind of thing but then he died and he didn't
B	percentage of the world's oceans that have been explored?
A	two percent
B	no but in the right kind of vibe
B	five percent
A	in the middle of the oceans they are just so deep and every big mountain range is
B	er yes
B	basically all continents are surely just big mountains popping out of the water
A	yeah but in between them you know? like in like in the middle of the African America
B	yeah
A	they're moving apart all the time
B	oh right
A	does it matter?
B	one night?
A	could be two could be really really
A	you don't like going away at all do you?
B	it's not that I don't like going away it's just I'm the worst person in the world in that sense like left to my own devices I'd quite happily go on holidays and just kind of work on projects and things that I like
A	you're autistic
B	cos the
A	do you have holidays in your head?
B	no no just not see I don't subscribe to this it's not the actually going to exotic places can be very interesting and kind of erm what other words with inish inish enjoyable but like I think I don't subscribe to this sole view that like people are obsessed okay
A	if you if you weren't working would you be interested in going to other places just anyway?
B	if I was independently wealthy and kind of had all the time in the world then yeah I'd spend a portion of that time going to other places because they could be very interesting but as well I'm also
A	say if you retired would you? would you go away every now and again?
B	lots it would depend how much money I had
A	yeah
B	but but as well like I think some people are a bit mad I mean like mad too like in the sense that we talked about risk earlier on like
A	yeah
B	a lot of parts of the world are extremely dangerous to be honest like you know?
A	yeah
B	most parts it's like you know? the fact that
A	but you usually love taking risks
B	the fact that the
A	you
B	I don't drive fast
A	I know but you generally like taking risks
B	I wouldn't agree with it but like I when I'm driving I don't take risks
A	yeah
B	when I'm on that motorway there I would go a hundred and twenty kilometres an hour which is the speed limit and not feel that that's fast cos all the other traffic is going and it's kind of built for that kind of thing but like there are drivers drivers take risks or do crazy things like they try to overtake
A	yeah
B	in crazy situations
A	no I know you don't I know you don't
B	I'll never do anything like that like I want to live in that sense like but but anyway
A	but you you take the mick out of me sometimes for not taking risks so
B	ah yeah but
A	what's the what's the problem with waiting for the green man?
B	because cos
A	but we pay but we pay for this safe system
B	coming back to your to your to your to your erstwhile imminent friend doctor
A	I
B	like
B	that's what I said
A	mm
B	like if he was measuring it in morts I'm sure he'd be going actually
A	actually
B	we're talking about crossing the road
A	with the risks I'm not that bad crossing the road I manage to cross roads that I
B	I just think like I just think like as an average barometer of whether someone is risky or not you're the wrong judge I think because you tend to be very risk-averse
A	mm okay I don't but but yeah no I was just
B	back to the holidays
A	yeah before you started beating me with the risk risk
A	no I don't say you're a very risky driver but you do
B	drive fast
A	you do drive fast you
B	on a motorway
A	you you like being a a well like in the trampoline you're you you do you're you like jumping high
B	yeah yeah yeah okay but
A	you like running fast
B	but I think you're
A	yeah I know no I know that
B	like
A	I'm not I'm not actually being very critical
B	I know but but I think that there's a nuance to it in the sense no I know you're not being critical
A	yeah
B	but there's a nuance that okay I just use the trampoline for bouncing in a very straightforward way I've tried to bounce as high as I want but I don't use it for doing flips or anything ridiculous like like
A	no
B	I think ah I I'll do things within the confines of the regulations of
A	mm
B	like you know I like going on roller coasters
A	yeah
B	there's a sense that because usually they're very well
A	usually
B	but eh but that's one of the few accidents you've ever heard of like
A	I know
B	give me like they usually the big ones usually very good safety regimes very well designed
A	yeah I would have thought Alton Towers is probably better than the piers
B	and I still can't figure out how fecking you can have a crash on a roller coaster when there's only one set of cars going at a time
A	well see maybe they were like they released a second set say by accident
B	yeah but then
A	at the wrong time
B	within proximity things and all kinds of stuff
A	yeah
B	that's why
A	but you're
B	where they like for me for me a holiday in inverted quotes right or is like
A	mm
B	time off to do whatever the fuck I like
A	mm
B	or some
A	but we get like a night or two with me
B	but that's different that's not
A	and that's there that's apart from our
B	that's taking time out for ourselves that's not saying that's kind of different in a way to a holiday in my mind like you know what I mean?
A	mm
B	like in
A	you're not going to be miserable are you? you will enjoy it you will enjoy it
B	erm
A	oh
B	do I generally tend to be miserable if we're away?
A	sometimes you can
B	careful now careful
A	yeah
A	yeah but even if we're say doing things like eating lunch that kind of thing isn't it just nice doing that with me anyway wherever we are?
A	opportunity just to
B	not opportunity splendid
B	no there's a particular kind of
A	you know?
B	it's kind of erm
A	there is one
B	eh see this is what I'm saying about you you're very conscientious about what other people want to do
B	yeah
A	like
B	of course cos I want you to enjoy yourself too
B	yeah but but you see
A	mm
B	kind of eh
A	it's more like I know you're not always the easiest to kind of feel like you've been
B	mm yeah
A	but I know that before say if I've gone away then erm I found it a bit of a burden in the end knowing that there's not a lot of things we're doing that you really like
B	so you've gone away or we've gone away
A	we've gone away together and then in the end I quite liked being able to do one or two things that I know you like cos it actually just makes me feel a bit better
B	mm
A	otherwise I feel overburdened so you could just do it for me
B	so
A	to just help me enjoy myself
B	like hang on so to make you not feel guilty you do things that I enjoy but I can just do them to make you happy
A	yeah
B	ah
A	it's just
B	I want you to enjoy yourself but I want you to do it to keep me happy
A	yeah because you
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's like now when people get married no we have to have the best wedding ever we got to have this we got to have that we got to do this funky crazy dance that everyone thinks is cool
A	yeah mm
B	like you know? rather than just now I'm not saying that can't be amazing and brilliant at a wedding
A	yeah no I know what you mean
B	but like I suppose my key point
A	I suppose it depends on it like so if you were never going to go away together then I don't just end up going away with other people all the time and in the end it would just actually it would kind of cause problems so I think there are some things that would
B	cos you'd be off shagging around the world is it?
B	okay but let me rephrase that so okay but what if we? okay but okay but here's my point but and again I'm not actually trite about you saying that I'm more going
A	mm
B	if we never went away travelling together and you always had to do it yourself and we never had time where we went off and just had some nice time with each other
A	yeah
B	like what I'm trying to say really is that if you had plenty of time where we went off and did something nice with each other but we didn't travel together possibly that and I don't mean you I'm just this is just an example
A	mm
B	possibly then that would be fine but it's where you've got the absence of both where it becomes problematic
A	yeah
B	does that make sense?
A	oh yeah I mean
B	whereas obviously if you can do them all together that's even better still but
A	yeah I mean I suppose if we were one of the couples right which a lot of people are where they they they feel like they have to do everything together and they don't do anything apart then probably wouldn't be here now would we? because there's plenty of things that we we do independently you know? we're relatively kind of independent like that probably
B	yes
B	that's the nub of your point then is it?
A	erm well we could
B	apparently the average global life expectancy in nineteen hundred was thirty-one and in two thousand and eleven it's seventy that's shockingly alarmingly progressive
A	yeah that
A	no
B	but my point is the curve is accelerating
A	erm yeah but not as much as you'd think because the infant
B	oh you're saying that's skewing the figures?
A	yeah
B	saying now we've got a very low infant mortality but yeah
A	I mean women were having like eight children and expecting you know a couple of those to die in their early years which is kind of
B	so we're actually not living longer it's just that
A	we are living longer
B	yeah we are living
A	yeah
B	that's what the
A	I mean it's amazing
B	I let you win that point
B	mm mm
A	they're increasing the infant sort of expectation of survival as babies expectation of
B	god
A	I know it's a very hot volatile place isn't it now? I think we should get erm
B	assessed?
A	yeah not as in kind of
B	assessed for what?
A	I don't know
B	assessed under what criteria?
A	I suppose there's a few things we could either I've risen away like if if there was endless money and loads of time we'd be hearing his speech and erm like his little autistic tendencies but they're all
A	yeah I have some it's just I mean
B	okay and if you were to
A	I don't really know which one
B	okay but probably you've probably narrowed it down to three into parts and fucking ridiculous research behind it so of those three how much would they roughly cost and where would they be?
A	erm
B	cos I know you know I just know you know
A	you you know that
B	mm
B	sure it's like
A	yeah
B	she she said to me one day they were better like she was better but then she would
A	what? the ones in
B	yeah but I I don't know anything about it
A	are they? is there one in the city as well?
B	is there?
A	I don't know
B	do you get a cert saying autistic not autistic
A	no I know you don't you
B	or do you slot it on a spectrum?
A	it's more of a kid of a erm
B	but is there like?
A	it's not a diagnostic test
B	no but he needs to talk within the next months in a big way or then we'll kind of be worried
A	I just think this
B	you should try that you were looking for icons The Noun Project dot com
A	mm
A	well I do know I mean I suppose there's two things of thought we could just wait and in in all I think I think if we waited and did nothing I think he'd be kind of alright but then if there's a possibility he's got something mild then we might be able to help him a bit more I don't know
B	mm mm
A	cos it's only it's so hard so hard to say isn't it?
B	sorry how much did she say? did she say how much it cost?
A	it's two hundred and fifty euros for the
B	you don't get a free kind of consultation where you're in for ten minutes cos they think
A	yeah I see yeah yeah
B	do you usually get referred?
A	and see if I went to the doctor again I think it would be too I don't know if
B	the doctor's clueless
A	the doctors and you know those nurses or whatever they completely they haven't even got back to me to do his two years' assessment even though I've asked twice
B	mm mm
A	and and they were I don't really have loads of faith in but I mean that's another
B	that's another hour's conversation
A	that's another yeah that's
B	but yeah there's a there there's a downside there's worrying
A	mm yeah
B	probably can't hurt to have a conversation with with a
A	well
B	I mean I'd quite happily ring them and have a conversation with them
A	yeah
B	no just they might go well you know what? bring him in for ten minutes and we'll tell you whether we've had any whether we think he should have an assessment you know? they might just say something like that
A	mm mm yeah
B	you know what I mean like? it's very hard
A	I suppose so but even then they probably need to be a team of
B	yeah but they have the different people in there and things like
A	mm
B	yeah but at least they could go yeah we've seen loads of kids we're not worried about him
A	well I'd I imagine last few wouldn't be that worried about him but part well I suppose part of me is thinking a little bit if it was a question of money and we just missed you know? we missed a
B	you're thinking you're thinking of early intervention
A	yeah or maybe
B	the importance of
A	yeah
B	yeah but like if we tried it like I definitely think like spending two hundred quid now to get is better than spending having to spend more or do a lot more or do a lot more work
A	yeah
B	when there's more damage done
A	yeah yeah
B	once like this what I think you know none of us are seriously worried
A	but
B	he's special but special in a sense that like
A	no I'm not really worried
B	but like
A	and the amount of like like even in the past week he seems to be getting things like no and look he knows what look
B	and as well like he's interacting like in the last month or six weeks with
A	yeah he bonds really well only with a few of us but he's not I can't imagine not being
B	yeah he's very cuddly and
A	yeah and so I don't think he's severe in
B	like he's funny and humorous
A	not be able to say something if somebody with severe speech thinks whatever one of those he's not
B	but he can say every word under the sun
A	yeah
B	he just doesn't couldn't be arsed
A	yeah but I I suppose part of me cos I was wondering whether sometimes I think with
B	and this obsession with screaming when people are talking
A	yeah he's really sensitive to sound and erm have to do quite a lot of things again and again with him like the alphabet again and again and again
B	well
A	yeah but you know? he's quite he's
B	Hyper Legacy dot com
A	yeah Hyper Legacy and they're all full of kids who can read early but they're all all obsessed or interested in numbers and letters early but have speech delay so they're they're like just like
B	do they all speak eventually?
A	yeah see a lot of them were saying you know? they were diagnosed autistic and they were erm and then it just all those autistic
B	I think dissipated is a nice word
A	dissipated yeah and there's some people who seem to have kids who are autistic and it there's no there's not really so much out there he can tell a lot between them mm
B	so
A	and there's some kids who just seem to be like that but they didn't have speech delay they were just normal and they just weren't very bright
B	indeed
A	erm but anyway so is that? erm so a lot of them are sort of fighting for it to be a distinct erm
B	yeah
A	but he seems like he was he's had quite a lot of difficulty either that or she was
B	mm
A	really going overboard with how much time she spent with him
B	oh my god it's five to ten
A	oh well
B	so
