B	yeah where is he from?
A	accents actually
B	yeah
A	but in the thing there you are
B	uhu
A	and er
B	mm hm
A	and this is what a guard looks like if you have the guard in your hands
A	and you use it to eliminate
A	a player
C	shush I'm listening
A	you guess the erm the identity of someone else's card which you can you
B	uhu
A	okay? so there's five guards right?
B	yeah
A	when you play a priest you just choose one person from the table and you say I wanna secretly see your card so if I play that to you
D	okay
A	then maybe the next round if I have a guard I'll say
D	okay
A	alright? okay so there's to priests five guards two priests
B	come round come to me
C	you go to nanny then
A	okay there's two barons
B	you got her babe?
D	come on climb up sorry
B	right two barons yeah?
A	okay so also you'll see that they all have different values right?
B	yeah
A	at the end of the game if people aren't eliminated the person with the value card at the end of the game wins
B	mm hm
A	right?
A	so it goes from one two three up till eight so the princess has got a value of eight and she's like the most powerful character right?
C	why is she more powerful than anything?
A	that's how ah well
C	it's irrelevant
C	right
A	so he's eliminated
B	okay
A	during the game you'll work out I think
B	okay
A	okay it's number four is a handmaiden there's two handmaiden a handmaiden just means nobody can attack you for one round
B	mm hm
A	you play it and nobody can attack you for a round yeah?
C	yeah
A	yeah okay
C	is that my thing?
A	there's two princes a prince you just had another person
C	oh great yeah
A	doesn't really do so much that card it's not that good but it's a number five this is a number six there's only one of these
C	it's a butterfly
A	number seven doesn't do anything but like it's really high up yeah? number seven is gonna win you the if it comes to a baron or it comes to the end of the game number seven is probably gonna win you the game er if you have a prince or a king in your hand you have to discard the countess
D	okay
A	so if I discard it people are gonna know in my other you always have two cards oh I should have said that
C	a prince or
A	a prince or a king but maybe I'll play this and I and I've got a baron just to put you off so you
B	uhu
A	gets oh
B	right
C	okay
A	you'll pick it up it's really easy
C	I was gonna say er your round
D	sounds it
A	okay
D	sounds dead complicated
A	it's really
B	it's not
A	honestly
D	okay
A	I'm I'm probably making it sound a lot more complicated than it is
D	well no no
D	feels hot doesn't it?
C	you're you keep moving your eyes
A	okay so that's your card keep it secret that's yours that's
A	on
D	no
A	of the deck
A	right? she'll look at two of them
D	hold it but don't show anyone?
A	and then she'll choose which one of them she wants to play so you've always got a choice of two which one you're gonna play right?
B	okay shall I say what it is and explain why I'm doing
A	uhu
B	so I'm gonna play the the guard card
D	no
A	you wanna play that
B	okay?
B	the the roles that you've got in your hands
B	I can guess the card that you've all got
A	no one person
B	but I can't guess
A	a guard can't accuse a fellow guard
B	yeah
A	they have to say I think you're the
C	so it's just a shot in the dark?
B	yeah cos at the minute
B	I've got absolutely no idea
A	but later on she'll be able to calculate okay it's definitely not the king because we've seen the king put down
C	okay
A	et cetera
B	so looking at like the numbers of how many of the cards exist I'm gonna guess
A	look
C	it's wrong
A	okay
B	okay
A	so you don't say anything
B	that's fine
A	and that's
C	so I don't need to say
A	no just say it's wrong
B	say it's wrong
A	right okay
A	but you don't say no I've got the king or whatever
C	okay
A	just say nothing right so now it's my turn so
D	and if you have got the one you just
A	then you're eliminated you show it and you're eliminated right?
D	yeah okay
A	okay so it's my turn so I'm taking a second card and I'm choosing which one to play I'm gonna play a guard as well and I'm gonna say
C	yeah
A	cos if she did she wouldn't accuse you of having it so I'm gonna say
B	no
A	okay so she hasn't it's your turn
A	course you can yeah
B	it's there
C	so I'm gonna play a guard
A	yeah
C	and I'm gonna say that
A	no
D	you just say what card you put down whichever one you want not your better one just whichever one you want
A	the one you put down is the one you are using
D	right okay
A	right?
A	so you can kind of also then
C	the ones you put down are the ones you what?
A	the ones you put down are the ones you're using to a like attack someone right?
C	yeah
A	so you've just used that
C	yeah so this is your the my one yeah
A	that's the one
A	now you've got in your hand
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	right so I'm putting down
A	okay so that's a baron right?
D	yeah
A	so that means this card in your hands
D	mm
A	hopefully for you it's high
D	right
A	right?
D	right
A	you're gonna choose one other person around the table
C	right
A	okay so whoever you think has got the lowest but you can't really tell that at the moment so it's gonna be a pot luck shot in the dark really
D	just a pure guess?
A	yeah
C	me again
A	okay so you compare you compare er hands
C	I knew you'd go with me
D	why?
A	okay?
D	right so show it to me
A	so you two you two compare hands but don't show me and
D	what I can show him this?
B	yeah
A	you can show him this yeah cos one of you is gonna be
D	and what and I've got to have the higher hand than him?
A	yeah and
D	and then he's out if I've got a higher
C	what if it's the same?
A	exactly
C	what you got?
D	well show me yours then
A	but don't say anything
D	come on we've got to show each other
A	okay
C	erm
A	so
C	so I'm out?
A	you're
B	okay
D	sorry babe
C	I knew you'd
D	well I
C	you had no feeling
D	I did
B	erm
D	set you free
B	I'm gonna guess
D	do I just say the answer?
A	so you just say yes or no
D	no
A	okay
A	okay I'm playing a handmaid right? so I'm blocked from this round
A	you can't attack me okay? your turn
B	erm
E	he's with grandad
D	grandad
E	come and sit with nanny?
D	do you wanna sit with nanny? just put him down a minute
E	no
D	oh no god no peace
A	so just choose whichever card you want and then put that face down and then but you can't do it to me you'll have to do it to
D	right okay I'm gonna oh
C	you okay mate
D	put that one down the priest
C	sorry mate
A	that's alright that's alright
B	okay so that means that
A	so
B	you can look at my
A	at
B	my card
A	so I show her?
D	yeah I look at yours and you don't look at mine
B	no
D	sorry
B	it's alright
D	I've got contacts in right
B	okay
A	so you know what that is now
D	yeah
A	so you can use that
B	to your advantage
A	so you have information and you can use like maybe later on you can accuse her of having that card and eliminate her or whatever
D	ah okay
B	okay?
D	yeah
B	so now it's my go
C	oh
D	oh
C	yeah I'd love to have just to have her but I doubt she will
D	well just try?
B	erm
C	can you sit with me?
D	just ten minutes
B	gonna play the prince which means that erm I have to choose somebody
C	gonna sit with me
B	to er discard their card and to get a new one so I can't get
D	right so I'm doing what sorry on my card?
B	so you discard a card
A	discard your card
B	add it to this pile here
A	face up
D	what
B	face up so I can see it
D	face so everyone can see
A	okay so you're eliminated
B	oh
A	cos the princess has got the best value but the thing about her she hasn't got an ability if you discard the
D	so I'm out of the game?
A	yeah so
D	ah
A	the highest value win so you would have definitely won
D	right okay
A	but she was lucky to eliminate you there
D	so keep explaining what you're doing though so now
A	okay
B	yeah
A	okay so it's my turn
D	right okay
B	okay so
A	right and she's
B	yeah okay
A	playing it that's when I knew so you can
B	er you discard your card
A	okay
C	do you want to go to nanny?
C	what a surprise
C	oh look at that
A	also right looking at this now
B	what?
C	look at that
B	what is it?
C	got some right bloody things on it
E	what is it?
D	a cockroach
C	is it?
D	yeah
B	oh no don't say that I hate cockroaches
C	look how big its thingies are
B	it looks like a cockroach
C	that's not a cockroach what's that look?
B	looks like one
C	look how big its
A	yeah I don't know yeah it's like a bug I don't think it's got looks like a beetle doesn't it?
C	it's horrible
D	should
C	I hate stuff like that
D	sweep it up
C	I hate stuff like that
B	should we brush it out of the way a bit?
C	I hate stuff like that
D	what
C	it's flying
A	mm yeah I don't I mean
B	oh
D	oh
E	chopped it in half
C	oh could just
E	look
D	lovely
C	what you don't normally kill them?
B	you don't know what they are
unknown_female	the I dunno if it's
D	well it's a good way to keep your feet
D	to keep your feet off the floor
C	I thought you don't normally kill them mum
B	cockroaches yes I do
D	horrible aren't they?
A	okay right so I took the last card
B	yeah
A	so I'm saying when on the table this information tells you what cards other people have got in their hands because like for example
A	there's a priest here and there's a priest here there's only two priests in the game
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
C	whose one?
B	yeah
A	right so now cos we've got to
C	what so do you lost with a princess?
D	yeah cos I had to
D	I had to discard it
A	and if you discard a princess
D	right
A	you you're dead
C	oh okay
A	right so that's the end of the first round one card by the way you take out of the game and put it to the side straight on this before the game starts so you can't exactly read every card on the table
D	right
A	so there's still a bit of mystery that's the
D	so who won out of you two sorry?
A	I had six
C	I am
A	and she had four so
D	right
A	I won the first one
C	what a surprise
D	I liked that
A	but it no it's like
A	it's a game of luck really more than anything else
C	oh
A	yeah
C	well
A	there's not a huge amount
B	there's not even
A	you can do with that
B	yeah
D	oh go on darling
A	okay right
D	are they trying to get you?
A	take one from the top
C	where where is that
E	nanny killed it
E	nanny killed it

E	you've got a red face
C	that
E	spider yeah
C	baron
B	no
A	okay
C	alright
C	alright
D	I'm gonna play
A	okay so you're protected for this whole round no one can attack you
B	erm
C	no
A	alright cos you guessed that
C	baron
A	yeah so she knows that you haven't got the baron cos if you had the baron you wouldn't have guessed she was the baron right? so
C	yeah
A	that information you kind of
C	why? there's two barons
A	yeah but they cos percentage wise
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	careful
A	with the priest and I'm gonna look at
B	but there's two brushes in there
A	okay
E	that's a mop
D	er put the mop back
E	that you don't need the mop darling it's the brush you want
D	come on
E	come on no mops it was

C	sorry yeah
D	stop trying to get payback
C	I'm gonna say
A	nope
D	yes and now I just pick
A	and it's your regular turn yeah
A	okay so I've got to discard the king so that would have killed me if it was a princess
D	oi oi oi oi oi
B	erm

A	that is just the worst threat to a kid isn't it?
B	I'm gonna guess that

D	no
A	alright er
C	I am going to
E	don't go under the table

A	skinhead like a
A	and he's er
D	that's exactly what you think of exactly
C	no no that name's hard cos you can't shorten it it's four
D	I think of some big butch woman like
C	that's just like like the first thing
D	like Myfanwy
A	that's like well it's like six vowels it's like
C	the first thing I said
A	six syllables
C	I said surely that's gotta be shortened
A	yeah yeah
C	and you can't
A	no you can't really
B	Mo
C	M
A	oh
C	M
B	Mer Merle oi Merle Merv Van?
A	actually
D	Van?
A	no that would be Fanny wouldn't it?
A	no because Fanny's a name
C	yeah it would be
A	Fanny is like an old fashioned name
C	yeah yeah
A	that's probably where it comes from
D	you're just putting me off the name even more if that was possible
D	Myfanwy
D	god
A	er do you know in New Zealand there was this Maori couple and they called their son four ever as in number four
D	mm
A	no no not four ever four real number four R E A L right? altogether
D	no they didn't
A	yeah no they did and then when they went to the naming when they went to the registration office or whatever they said no you can't you can't do that
D	good
A	and then they went oh yeah you can't tell because they were Maori
F	where's
C	in there so don't go in there
C	what?
F	ten minutes
C	ten minutes?
A	they were like you can't tell us how to call our kids because obviously like sometimes they call their kids funny names now you know?
D	mm
A	and they were like yeah but
C	I hope you don't want any wedges
A	but it like
A	you can't have a number in your name and they're like yeah but you this is our culture and it's like your culture isn't to call your kids numbers instead of names
D	god
A	I was
C	but on the other hand can't you like call your kid anything?
A	in France
B	yeah
A	choose from a list
D	no you're not allowed
A	in France
D	to call them anything
C	did you ever read that but like it was obviously a fake but it was like a Facebook thing where like
A	mm if if you call your kid Hitler
C	racist
A	right yeah yeah
C	like really racist and
D	yeah
C	did you read that?
B	I think I think you can have whatever name you want in Britain but I think that they would there's a line where they would probably go hang on a minute I think we need to
A	you can't call your like Hitler
D	double check that
A	Twat you can't call
D	yeah
A	a kid Hitler Twat for example
C	could you call his could they call him Hitler?
A	yeah probably yeah maybe
D	yeah
A	cos it's like a legitimate name isn't it?
B	they might they might say to you have you really thought about that?
A	yeah
D	uhu
A	and then when that finished
C	yeah
A	so they were like Madeinusa that's cool let's call our kid Madeinusa
D	oh god
A	it would give you a complex
B	yeah but Myfanwy is borderline with that
A	do you reckon?
C	yeah terrible name
C	I'm not I
A	I think like I mean it would be hard like in Cardiff that would be unusual in
D	no
B	how do you spell it?
A	M Y F A N W Y

D	yeah before we even
A	was it?
D	before we even conceived
A	and is that what
D	yeah we both liked it didn't we? for ages

D	no no but it's definitely like
A	Tabitha or

F	well
D	a lot of erm
F	yeah they talk about the
D	mm
A	she wasn't very popular there was she?

A	but also that er in the
C	it's like
A	Liverpool Everton
C	yeah but
A	fans but we're scousers more than anything

A	yeah but you so you'll still see
C	they would never do that now
A	yeah but you still see
C	they would never do that now
A	yeah but you still see Everton shirts in the home end in the Anfield when they play when there there's the Liverpool Derby you'll still like er the odd blue shirt next to a red shirt

A	you're expecting it to be soft so you bite into it and it's gone rock hard

F	that makes two of us
D	oh I love sleep
B	I highly recommend a weekend
C	Sunday Sunday is the only time I do have a sleep in the day like
B	yeah
C	literally I I can't
B	it
C	help myself I I will fall asleep at any time
B	it sorts it sorts me out properly now
C	yeah Sunday is the only
D	yeah
C	day where literally I'm hello poppet
B	I go on a Sunday
D	ah
B	I often often asleep about two hours
B	I love it
C	tired ain't you? go to sleep poppet
B	yeah I always believe like if I go to bed and I just and I have a nap for about ten minutes I'm like well that's obviously all I needed but sometimes I go in and I'm like I come out and it's two and a half hours later and I'm just like
D	yeah
B	I must have been exhausted cos I can't lie in I can't like get the weekend if there's no alarm clock
F	yeah I'm the same as that
B	so a weekend is the only time if I wanna catch up a little bit
A	right okay right
D	yeah
A	so if you have a blue imagine you have a blue train right? if you make a connection between Amsterdam
D	mm hm
A	that's one two three cards you need to give to the bank right? and the yellow so you'll need to give
D	okay
A	if you
D	mm hm
A	right? if it's grey
D	okay
A	when it's a tunnel I'll explain a tunnel but a tunnel's a bit of a risk and er you might not build it you might have to pay an extra instead of costing two that might cost you three blues
D	okay
A	that's it
C	beforehand you get given a card of of routes you have to do
A	you'll get like a long
C	yeah
A	you'll get the you get three tickets in total right? and the one of them will be long and the other three will be short so this tells you that you wanna be aiming to go from Amsterdam
D	okay
A	you can go whatever way you want all around the houses or completely direct you choose if you do it you'll get nineteen points at the end of the game if you don't you get minus nineteen points at the end of the game
D	okay
A	so the long one especially like you really wanna do also you'll be given three other short routes one two three
F	these are awesome
B	mm
A	with the long route
D	okay
A	so that's for example these both leave from Amsterdam so if it was me I would take this route this route you only have to take one of the short ones
A	and I would chuck these back in the pack so I would go Amsterdam to Rostov but it's gotta go via Vienna no? or Venetia so I'd go Amsterdam
D	okay
A	that's it
D	right
A	that's all there is
C	okay
D	are you trying to stop people in their tracks making theirs or is it just
B	mm
C	well
A	kind of that's how
C	apparently
A	you know
C	apparently apparently there's a gentleman gentlemanly er
A	agreement
C	that you shouldn't but I
D	how many do you start off with?
C	I was annoyed last game
A	three
B	three
F	yeah
A	okay hang on
C	I was annoyed cos
A	so you start
D	uhu
C	thought about it and he didn't just
A	it's just the way
D	gonna help mummy?
A	so I think we should play for the stations as well then shall we?
B	oh I've never played with them
A	okay okay so these are your cards and they were secret right?
D	yeah
A	and apart from that
D	mm hm
A	and a connection you have to put it all down at once you can't just say okay I'll just do two of the blues like you'll have to be that whole connection right?
D	okay
A	so on your turn you can either play a train or you can collect more cards
D	okay
A	so you wanna be taking
A	oranges so you can either you take two cards in total from the pack from the table or from the deck
D	mm hm
A	right?
A	er if you don't want any of these cards take it from the deck
D	okay
A	that's all there is
D	okay
A	alright
C	so do we get a route now?
A	so this is your long route this is your long route your long route
D	okay
A	shorts
F	you are lovely you
B	choo-choo
A	choo-choo
B	what's he doing?
A	so
D	alright
D	nanny's in bed want to go to bed?
C	want to go to nanny?
D	can I have my card back?
C	right give them to
D	don't call me
C	mummy give it to mummy
D	you going to bed with nanny then?
C	listen
C	listen
A	I think we should play with stations
B	yeah? I just don't I just don't really know it so
F	what?
A	no worries mate
B	that's the next er level
A	I'll let that we'll we'll get playing with the round bits
B	okay right can I give it back then? thank you
A	you choose the spears
B	what do you mean the
A	a bag of spears
D	okay
F	I'll give you one back
A	alright brave
F	thank you
A	he who dares wins
B	watch yourself there's
F	yeah I forgot that was there
A	and obviously
D	mm?
A	this is a single route but these are double so say I take all the pinks that means that yellow one is still available right?
D	okay
D	yeah very
A	all of them?
D	yeah
A	you do not care mate
A	you are on the edge
D	or don't know
A	because remember if you don't do them you
D	no I'll stick them on
A	right
A	any questions now before we start?
D	no I'll just blag it
A	alright
D	mm hm
A	but see these ones with like the black border on the thick black border on the outside?
D	mm hm
A	as opposed to these ones with no black border
D	yeah
A	which means these tunnels and they go to a mountain regions which is harder to make a connection and it's a risk so you give your two to the your two blues to the bank then we have to turn over three cards from the deck
D	mm hm
A	to make a successful tunnel if you don't have extra blue or you don't have an extra multicolour then you have to wait till your next turn so when you're trying to get a tunnel it's always good to have like a multicolour as a backup insurance thing
D	okay
A	that's it
C	erm yeah
A	alright you go first then
D	mm
A	you can take two colour cards if you don't want any of these take two from the pack
B	or you can take one
A	okay
B	one okay
A	so you
D	okay er
F	what's the score with the grey routes
A	so they've all got to be the same colour so it's got to be four yellows four
F	oh you can't use them
A	four pinks four greens whatever
F	you can't use the magic card?
A	yeah yeah you can as well
B	yeah
F	oh
A	yeah yeah you can use the multicolour these ones the ferries
B	two you said yeah
A	yeah these
A	these ferries have to have to have one multicolour two blues or two yellows two greens two reds whatever
C	is that me?

B	yeah
C	erm
F	finished?
C	yeah
F	I'll go

A	tunnels
B	tunnels yeah
C	so if you've got two or whatever
C	you may as well
D	don't
C	take three because you might
A	cos they're
C	might get caught out by the turn of the card
A	cos it's always good to have a
D	right
A	so it's always good to have a multicolour to kind of back up just it case it happens
C	you could you could
D	yeah
C	take it on with two but
A	I
C	yeah
D	is it my turn?
A	uhu

D	I'm not shy
C	you're building up and then you're gonna hit us
A	you'll
A	yeah it's she can do that
D	what about when you've created a line? what do you?
C	you go toot toot
A	no when you get a ticket don't say it because you don't want people to know what you're doing cos all no the
D	you just wait till you've got all your lines?
A	no because then no you don't say it's the end of the game if you if you've got all your lines in er in on your turn instead of laying trains down and picking up cards you can choose to take three routes and three new tickets you'll look at them and you've got to choose one or two or three
D	okay
A	but a minimum one
D	okay

C	oh yeah
B	ah
C	no one ever seems to like go round this area
A	yeah that would mean
B	it really does depend on the
A	to get to that one gets you twenty-one point could you imagine it? could you imagine it? the tension of going for that
C	the last game I could have gone that way but I bottled it
C	what if I'd have bust that first game in?

A	the clue is right that's black because the colour there is black on it right?
D	just
A	that's a little indicator for you
D	just looks a bit grey to me
A	that's a little
F	I had the same thing and got mocked
