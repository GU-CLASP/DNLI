B	and there's a few of them that say er piss or shit
B	yeah
C	well what do you say?
B	well I just say should you be saying that when you're here?
C	it's just a bit awkward isn't it? cos I it's
B	yeah but there's a time and a place for everything isn't there?
C	well yeah obviously I wouldn't want and it's
B	how you behave with your friends that you know
C	cos when did I see
B	oh right
A	er you know that
C	he was really good then actually though he was really well behaved and really helped out a lot
B	mm I can imagine
C	I showed
B	oh god
C	it was brilliant
A	he's a little shit isn't he?
C	yeah because
C	all the kids were just like
A	and
B	oh right
A	yeah go on
C	all the kids were just leaving and
C	he helped out all night
C	and
B	as usual
A	right
C	he literally sat on his phone as well at one point
B	you what?
C	literally sat on his phone at one point
B	oh he does
A	yeah that
B	yeah
A	how old is he?
C	isn't he in
B	yeah I think so
C	so
B	then
C	two years younger than me and a year older than
B	than
C	so seventeen turning eighteen this year
A	well
B	well he must be seventeen now
A	yeah he's seventeen now cos he's just passed his test
B	is his name
C	no
B	what was his name?
C	there was a
A	I don't know
B	it wasn't
C	no
A	oh no it wasn't
C	I can't remember what it was
B	no I can't now that you've asked
C	well I don't know I've literally just put on the chart I think we need to have a exec meeting so
B	right
C	so that's er I don't know why when we made the change they changed it oh er oh actually no I do
B	right
C	him look good
B	but like it's alright making him look good but he's gotta get off his backside and do a bit
C	I know cos like
B	yeah
C	cos I'm the chairperson
B	that's
C	yeah
B	and I think he'll do less and less now he's working
C	everything is like oh but I've got a job
B	mm
C	I'm working
B	yeah I think it will be
C	then when he wasn't working it was like yeah but I can have a massive lie in and do whatever I
B	it's always better than yours
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	if he was unemployed it was great because he could lie in and he could do whatever he want whenever he wanted but now he's got a job it's great because he's earning loads of money and he's gonna be dead rich
B	needs to grow up a bit really
C	and then he was moaning about the tax the other day
B	why?
C	just cos he's not been taxed before has he? so
B	well welcome to the real world
A	I know
B	mm
A	all this
B	oh they won't send him back they won't they know you can't have him back
A	mm
B	if they can't cope with him when they've got people coming in for eight hour shifts then going home how can you cope with him twenty-four seven?
A	mm that's right yeah
B	they won't they won't do that
C	they won't they'll never do that
A	mm
B	and there's other places they're refusing him saying that they'd never be able to cope with him
A	yeah
B	they're
A	no
B	if the worst comes to the worst they'll section him
A	I know but that's what er
B	it is a last resort
A	what about the
C	what what is
A	it's it's the where the doctor comes from
B	I think it's part of the hospital really
A	but you know I can't think who it was that said you know
B	it is but then if there's nowhere else what do you do?
C	it's hard for both sides cos it's er you can't
B	well
C	like you say like it's hard for you to have to travel to
B	no no
C	that he has a unique condition that's ended up being like this they can't like
B	I fail to believe that it's unique to be honest
A	no it is I don't think
C	well I do but like what else
A	that's what
C	it just seems it to me
A	she says there's lots of people go like that

A	yeah I'm sure it might be him
B	it's so sad it's really awful isn't it?
A	mm
B	cos he hadn't a clue really
A	mm
B	which is a good thing
A	no but he makes my eyes heavy when I start thinking about it
B	no
