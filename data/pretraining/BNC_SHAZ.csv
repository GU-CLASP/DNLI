D	oh right
A	which was fine but it meant we could just walk across the road

A	yeah we
B	yeah
A	just for just for
B	well the time
A	the sheer convenience of being there
C	fair enough
D	was it was it was it a lot extra or?
A	it
C	we always go for the cheap ones don't we?
D	yeah we
A	no it it well it was it was a it was a bit more
B	it was worth it
A	yeah but but
B	the
A	from our point of view you see
B	yeah
A	we we got there and we immediately booked
B	mm
D	you want a breakfast
A	cos we was there at six o'clock remember we were there at six o'clock
C	mm
D	yeah and you were straight off to the
B	then we went to have some er and we were eaten we'd eaten in half an hour
A	they'd got everything

A	they said that er we're going across yeah no problem we make sure you have
B	and we got it real quick didn't we?
A	blimey that was quick
B	perfect
C	good
A	so we got changed and then just walked across the road
B	yeah
D	and then
A	and then it finished and we walked cos and then we walked
B	then we
A	straight out straight into the into Wetherspoons
B	yeah there were some rough people in there
C	I can imagine
A	packed absolutely packed and we
B	yeah
A	we stayed there for ten or eleven drinks
D	was she?
B	she was so and it was funny
A	got boos
B	why did I say that?
A	the
B	and er
A	the arena the
B	and the and the and the judges were Craig
C	yeah
D	yes yeah
B	and er Tom who was er
A	Chambers
B	Tom Chambers who'd won in 2008 with Camilla
B	the actor?
B	yeah
A	their show dance
B	won with their show dance and it was erm it was lovely and then at the end they all did er erm Top Hat didn't they?
A	yeah
B	they all came on and Craig sang
B	and danced it yeah
A	Top Hat
A	top hat
A	and so and so we did that so that was er it was
A	it really was
B	that one
A	and it and I mean I have to say that I was very impressed with the arena itself
B	it was full
C	yeah there was erm we had a couple to choose from but when I was looking I was looking at the erm
D	the seating plans
C	seating plans and that looked like the smaller one like cos some of the like the one at like Birmingham and Manchester they were huge arenas like and the seats were like
D	well we
C	crazy like
D	yeah rather than
C	miles away from the stage
A	of course we
D	that's right
B	yeah
A	whatever at the everybody around it I mean cos of course
B	a lovely crowd
A	at that sort of thing everybody was quite nice and people were chatting to each other and everything
C	yeah
B	lovely crowd
A	erm the only thing
B	everyone was happy and
A	the only thing I found
B	it was so a good crowd
A	distracting cos again this is something that's come in for these big venues that I'm not I'm still not used to
D	did you?
A	is the it's the fact that you've got two big screens
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and
B	and it really is real
A	and then you start oh look and you're watching the screen
B	yeah
A	well where did that come from? it's not and of course it's not on the TV it's
C	yeah
A	something else has happened
B	when when they did the song at the end with Craig singing
A	yeah
B	really it was it was stunning and everybody came back on didn't they?
A	and one of the dancers were there was like a girl doing on you know
B	yeah
A	twin rope things
D	oh right
A	and she went up
B	yes
A	right into the ceiling
B	amazing
C	that's quite cool
A	which I missed because I was watching the TV
C	yeah
D	a lot going on then
B	we had
A	oh well it was
B	we had a we had a bet before I
A	I said she'd be wearing black
B	and he said wearing black and she was wearing black sparkles
A	and there was a whole group in from Grimsby
A	and lots of shouting to get what's his name to get his top off
C	Thom Evans
C	oh
A	he did finally
B	he did in the end and he threw his
A	he gave he gave it to
B	his little jacket at Craig and Craig said oh didn't quite expect
A	it so so
B	but er
A	thank you ever so much it was
C	you're more than welcome
B	yeah it was stunning
A	so we we we got to bed at
D	the company had not done it before
A	no
B	I know it well it's
A	and we got and we got to bed
B	it's things like cats and kids and kids and
A	we got to bed and and put the TV on and you were watching Gogglebox weren't you? and we fell asleep watching Father Ted about half past midnight
B	I can't remember that I
A	erm so it was a nice lazy next day not start I went I was out walking round Leeds at getting a coffee about half past seven
A	and
B	I was fast asleep
A	ten o'clock
B	honestly
A	I think it was when I got her down for breakfast by
B	went down for breakfast
A	I sat down in in
B	and er in public he had to cut up my sausage and my bacon and everything
A	so breakfast was absolutely that was actually very good what
B	mm
A	what was it twenty-two pounds?
B	for two of us
A	for two of us for a
B	mm
A	and breakfast
B	yeah
C	that's good
A	and you had two courses for the evening meal
B	mm
A	as much as you want to eat for breakfast
C	I think that's a relatively new thing actually
A	and oh
C	I've seen that
A	yeah
C	as an added extra recently
A	and the only think you couldn't have
B	yeah
A	for
C	cos we've never done that
B	it was
C	because the
A	I had a
C	before the breakfast
A	I had a
C	was eight
D	it was eight pounds or something
C	yeah eight pounds yeah
A	I yeah
D	each
B	mm
A	yeah so it was six pounds I think for just breakfast
D	yeah
A	on its own and I had I mean I had a I had a it was a sixteen ounce steak or something or a yeah a sixteen ounce steak
B	and you said it was alright didn't you?
A	it tasted alright
B	well this morning we we had a Beefeater
A	well yesterday
B	at the Premier Inn
B	yeah

B	it turned out to be closed
B	well it's it's a mill and often they do feature
D	yeah
B	they do feature on the north west it appears on the television but I had heard that they had lots of little craft sections
D	yeah
B	things clothes all sorts of things in these units in
A	well it seems to go
D	far from Leeds
B	and of course grandpa's not living up there anymore so I said to

D	oh right yeah
B	and then there's the huge bike shop

A	you've got to remember this is a good old-fashioned
A	mill with a great big chimney
D	yeah
C	mm
B	was closed wasn't it? this huge mill
A	and they were putting a new one in
B	and it was closed for six weeks

B	and er
A	and it really was just
B	it was
C	that's what t'interweb's for
D	yeah

D	being refurbished
A	we pulled in it's they're building so putting
D	yeah
A	seventeen bedrooms
C	they're doing that in
D	yeah
B	are they?
D	yeah but it's taking them a while
C	it's taking them ages
B	yeah?
A	yeah and they they've got it but the
B	but they said about breakfast in the Beefeater and they said get in before ten because
A	or nine before nine thirty
B	they do nine thirty was it? well anything they yeah they do breakfasts but under-fifteens are free and a lot of the locals go in there that's a deal isn't it? think how much you two ate
A	so and again

B	yeah
A	and when we and the the
C	and you don't have to be staying there?

D	the ground was er basically solid molehills you could stand on and just stamp on them as well
A	wow
B	nothing happened yeah
D	moles are clever though they're very
A	I watched I I stood there
B	watched one come up the other day
A	the other day on this
C	in the garden
A	in this path down there I was standing there
D	do they pop their head out?
A	I was waiting for the head to come up no we just well soil kept appearing
B	you should have got a camera
A	and there was nothing it was just and I suddenly saw the soil I dunno what made me look
B	do you know
A	and a mole just started
B	the Countryfile calendar
A	now this piece of soil popped out this popped up
D	yeah
A	and I carried on watching it for
D	wow
A	and it gradually got bigger got about that high
D	yeah and he was done
A	no
A	molehill is now
B	you mole
A	you are a rascal
B	so happy making burrows
D	why do they make holes?
A	well the soils got to go somewhere it's just
B	they make their tunnels
A	expanding its tunnel
B	and they get air as well a vent to go at that point
A	ventilation and it's also to do put the soil they're digging I mean they're digging
B	the works
A	they've gotta put the soil somewhere
D	doesn't it start somewhere?
A	well they must do
B	they start underground
D	because it really in my head a molehill would be where they start
B	the first mole
D	because if he's always
B	and Mr Mole
A	there would be
B	meets Mrs Mole underground
A	yeah there would be
B	and they have babies
A	but molehills mole or mole colonies the runs go for hundreds of metres

C	how do you know?
B	the mole er
D	like a mole
A	a mole hole it's a smoky it's a mole

D	yeah
C	on the west coast
B	oh yeah yeah
D	we went to Bute didn't we?
B	Bute is a
D	it's that's so the sea there was warm

B	you'd love it
C	don't waste a day
D	yeah but when you get out there you've got to
C	yeah

D	power nap
C	yeah

B	how lovely
D	if you just got some decent cleaning stuff you could cover it up though
B	you come on the stuff I've put down that sink
C	does he has he redone the piping so it goes like?
B	it just goes straight into it
C	fair enough
B	going back tomorrow morning dad's gotta be with do-da at ten thirty
C	do-da
D	what did
B	he wasn't he couldn't he hauled us in straightaway and he said look at this okay and and then that long bit bent
D	yeah it was bent
B	backing up in the middle of that round there and then it went
D	yeah
B	I nearly cried when I saw that
D	it's still there
B	I know
C	that is the scariest thing like though like there was a few there's
B	yeah
C	but like it's finding
D	who do you ask? yeah
C	finding people that you trust
B	well
C	to actually do a good job
D	yeah
B	and I said they're I said it's the only thing about the house
C	yeah
B	and I said when they moved in and it was so obvious that it was wrong I said they're the only thing that spoilt it for them you know when they moved in
C	just
B	ridiculous and it he he will get it sorted for you
C	that'll be good
B	he's so good and er cos I remember
C	yeah
B	okay finish your job off start another job
D	yeah you
B	cos he packs it all in as best he can cos he should have finished here Friday morning
D	to put up apartments or offices or
B	and then he's got office for block
D	yeah
B	that he has to change it to apartments
D	yeah
B	and he's got
C	that's they're huge jobs
B	they're huge jobs
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	and er he he started off just doing partitioning he's trained as a a carpenter his father was the
D	builder
B	it was his build business and he's more building and
D	really?
B	originally I believe
D	so
B	but then I think he's he's done a lot of painting and decorating
D	I knew dad had had them in the office for for partition
B	partitioning well he's changed the
D	yeah
B	and word of mouth
D	people
B	people
D	gone through that stage of we're we can't find afford to move
B	I know
D	but what money we do have we'll we'll put into our house
B	well to invest in with what we've got yeah
C	that's the best way to do it
B	it is
C	it's exactly what you guys have done here like you improve the space you've got
B	yeah
C	rather than trying to move
B	trying to move
C	but it's all about finding the right
D	the right place
C	place in the first place
D	to do it yeah we can't we can't improve ours at all there's nothing we can add to it as far as I can tell
C	no
B	no
C	we're already
D	we haven't got the space
C	talking about what we want next time though aren't we?
D	yeah
B	wait till you've made some money on it first
D	yeah
C	well
B	it'll be twelve months after the
C	oh yeah we're we're probably not gonna move for the next five years or so
D	no
C	but it's quite interesting to start having a little bit of a think about what we'll want
B	yeah
D	I'd probably say after five years look to remortgage with the whole lot in it
B	well if you
C	yeah
B	well we here
D	like so we'll probably end up with a eighty-seventy percent mortgage
B	with with here
C	if we pay ten percent off in five years
B	when we came here when we had the four bedrooms and we decided we probably needed the reception well we looked to do something rather than we were looking to extend there were no
D	oh yeah
B	and we looked at
C	yeah
B	because of dad's commute and er we looked at
C	yeah
D	oh it's
B	the size of the plot now since you've moved there has been a house for sale in
D	yeah
B	that is four-bedroomed it's so dated inside it's the sort of house that would have the partition between the dining room and the kitchen with internal glass windows
C	yeah
B	mottled
D	how much?
B	I can't remember it was a really good price it was er well less than two hundred thousand and that's the sort of thing that you can er do up
C	that's what we want
D	and
C	like not a huge not a huge like
B	south-facing
C	you're gonna have to rebuild stuff the house but
D	I need something from seventies eighties
C	yeah
D	that hasn't really
B	south
D	been
B	yeah just south-facing large back garden
C	yeah
B	and you'd think do you know if you could do the commute
C	yeah
B	to go for you know? you know I think it's four-bedroom
D	no
C	no but they're really easy to put in nowadays
B	absolutely
C	yeah and and also I love having an en-suite it's really practical but when there's actually only two of us in the house it's a huge waste like
B	yeah
C	we don't use the main bathroom and the main bathroom is nicer really obviously it hasn't got an a standalone shower it probably could if it was like
D	jiggled
C	jiggled around yeah
B	I love your house I do
C	I love our house as well it's just frustrating cos there's
B	yeah
D	there's a few things that we want
C	there's stuff I wanna do I'd I'd I'd love to if we had the money I'd love to just get cracking but it but that's life isn't it? you have to take your time with these things
B	yeah
C	and actually like without being er without being mean but it was quite nice going round
B	mm
C	and actually they haven't done a lot have they?
D	no
C	so it did it did make me feel like oh it's not as if like we're taking our time with it like
D	like what?
C	well I know they've got like do you remember their second bedroom it's got like a weird big boiler room?
D	yeah
C	yeah erm they were on about converting that to an en-suite or
D	okay
C	cos
B	it is a small bedroom that bedroom
C	the nursery
D	everything's really different
B	they
D	yeah
B	oh I think you need a holiday
D	no but you
B	well since he's retired we should have it's
D	you but you know you know what I mean? I'd rather
B	I like the comfort I must say I do like the comfort
D	yeah
C	well it's one of those things like if we had a one holiday-free year this year for example if we decided not to go away the amount we could do in the house
B	yeah
C	and then there's nothing stopping us going on holiday next year and the year after that and the year after that
D	yeah
C	but that one this one year would just help us like get settled
D	so much
B	yeah
C	and then I'd be like happy cos
B	yeah
C	thing is there's like there's obviously structurally nothing that needs doing with the house
B	yeah
C	it's all it's all
D	superficial yeah
C	like decorating
D	yeah
C	and it's just getting it up to a place where you think like actually I'm really like quite proud of this like
B	yeah you should feel that now cos like
C	yeah I mean we do don't we?
B	you really should
C	we are pretty chuffed
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	it is
C	I'm excited I can see what I wanna do in in the rooms and I just wanna get cracking but it
D	yeah I know
C	like help me do it once and then I'll know how to do it
D	there's no practical people in our lives
C	yeah
B	I know
C	but like it's even things like I dunno like tiling and stuff like that
B	mm
C	you just think if I I honestly reckon if I watched
B	do you know there used to be courses and
C	people do it yeah
B	there used to be courses for that?
D	there are there are there are there are aren't there?
B	I've I've been looking at
C	they're not that easy
C	it's a lot harder you can't just do a course for like and the thing is because there's so much paperwork now
B	mm
C	like you like all I'd wanna do is learn the practical skills and I'd never need to learn it to a point where I can actually do it as a job
B	yes
C	I just wanna be able to do jobs around the house
B	yeah
C	like tiling especially in think how convenient would it be if you knew how to tile?
B	it's cutting a bit and
C	yeah
B	having the confidence to cut it and and the grouting and everything
C	yeah
B	I'd love to be able to do things like that
C	and I just think like even like what was I looking at? your fire thing
B	mm
C	your er radiator cover
D	really?
C	I was thinking like if I was a little bit
B	but if er well
C	if I was a little bit more confident with a
B	put a
C	the wood saw or something you could have a go at it cos the sanding bit I think I'd enjoy and the painting and everything
B	yeah
C	so it would literally be just like
B	yeah
C	obviously you'd need a proper workbench and a proper wood cutter and stuff
B	yes
C	but like
B	but you see you spend all your money on those things
C	yeah
B	what they do on the computer er and I have the
C	yeah
B	and then it was off it was doing it
C	yeah
B	it was all
D	boxed in?
B	yeah
D	yeah they are they are
B	yeah
D	who who did it then?
D	oh right
B	erm
C	it's I don't I don't want a very big one so I don't think it would cost too much
D	do you know do you have a price on that?
B	can't remember
C	I'd be happy
D	what was
C	to paint it as well like if somebody could
D	long time ago so
C	just make it I'd probably have
D	probably scrape board
C	yeah
D	only the outside is painted isn't it?
B	yeah
D	oh you painted it?
B	I painted it
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	it's just MDF but I've read somewhere since where for kitchen cupboards and things like that where designers will send them to a paint sprayer a car sprayer
C	that's a bit clever
D	yeah
B	and they they
D	you can get it done there
B	the kitchen cupboards and they're meant to be more robust
D	yeah
B	well I think that's rather a good idea
D	it's good isn't it?
C	cos that's what I'd want
B	yeah
C	in the hallway I'd want it to match the walls
B	yeah
D	gloss just gloss
C	I don't even know if I'd be that fussed about having it like
D	oh I'd have them glossed they're gloss and
B	they're gloss
D	I would want gloss
C	what like a windowsill?
D	like a windowsill yeah
B	mm
D	like erm like all your doorframes and whatnot
C	well not our doorframes
D	well the the skirting boards around
C	mm
D	not very nice gloss but they're gloss
C	okay
B	you didn't find the diamond then?
D	I didn't know where to look
C	no we didn't
B	do you know it could have been here?
D	er where's it from sorry?
B	er?
D	where's it from?
B	it's grandma's engagement ring
D	how big is it?
B	grandma
D	how big is it?
B	an eighth
D	how big is that?
B	an eighth of an inch apparently
D	how big is that?
C	well
D	just gonna say an eighth for me
B	I'll show you
D	these things happen
B	I know
D	you wear them
B	I know I look best to wear them and get
D	just take take pride in the fact you've worn it and lost it
B	yeah
D	grandma will
D	wanna sit here?
C	okay so shall we we'll make the lasagne tonight then shall we? cos that's gonna be quicker than the curry and then I I'll also I'll do all the chicken for the curry
D	okay that's it yeah
C	so that we can make it tomorrow night yeah cos that that actual making
D	and then we can just heat it
C	and you could put it on when you get home and just leave it to
D	well the
C	simmer yeah
D	alright that's quite a good diamond is that worth anything?
B	yes
D	is it worth a lot?
C	that's actually a lot bigger than I thought it was we're gonna be honest we haven't even looked
B	no
C	so
B	I think it'll take
C	the problem being that your eyesight's so bad anyway
B	I had my glasses on I was on all fours and I erm I put the logs in the basket
D	where were you stood?
B	and I was sat her in the rocking chair
C	it's actually a lot bigger than I thought it was cos I did think oh you've got
B	no
C	absolutely no chance but
B	I know
C	yeah
B	I went everywhere it happened at lunchtime when
C	the problem
B	and
C	yeah could be anywhere couldn't it really?
B	could be anywhere
D	has she? where to?
C	I don't I dunno somewhere well a new campsite somewhere but she did say that erm
D	you didn't find it?
B	no
C	how much do you think it would cost you to replace it? quite a bit?
B	well it should be in the insurance
C	oh okay
B	it should be covered by insurance but then there was something on the radio the other day about it not being
C	I checked our stuff the other day and I think we're covered we're covered for pretty much any
B	oh yes
C	everything like the TV and stuff we're covered up to everything up to two thousand pounds
B	yes
C	and nothing in our house is worth
D	mm
C	so we're okay
B	actually can we just pull this out?
D	yeah
B	oh there's the key to the window
C	oh dear
