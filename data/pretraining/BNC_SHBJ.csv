A	next time we're in Oxford Street
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	it's illegal to sell
A	yeah they are apparently? I only thought it was illegal you know
B	how why? How were they're saying it? Out out
A	yeah
C	really?
A	whether you can buy it already bottled and then you fill up again
B	so are they saying this is from our farm?
A	no some geezer sells it to some farmer sells it to them and then they sell it on
B	honestly
A	but it's weird cos we used to get it when we were young
B	unpasteurised milk yeah
A	yeah and it's delicious
B	that's the thing isn't it? It's been fetched from a farm
A	yeah
B	so you know the farm or whatever
A	well I mean
B	it won't kill you though
A	we
B	yeah
A	I don't know much about it I just know that it tastes amazing
B	mm
A	so next time I'm out there I think I'll get me a bottle
B	interesting
A	hmm
B	but they have to stop selling it now?
A	well yeah I suppose apparently and it seems
B	hmm
A	did you?
B	apparently they're good for you
A	do you have a bath?
B	I can't fit in it
A	was he?
B	is a small man
A	I thought he was German?
B	yeah he is  he is  a small German but
A	uh huh
B	do you have a
A	no
B	A shower
A	yeah
B	I I like it
A	okay
A	I get a bit restless with the radio I need a radio television and computer on
B	you're like a little dog with ADH
A	yeah
B	ADDH
A	know your acronyms
B	attention Deficit Disorder ADD
A	I think I am though
B	ooh
A	and now I've got to wear glasses
B	have you?
A	are you a bit
A	yeah
B	you know when you get floaters you get floaters in your eyes?
A	no
B	bit frustrating
A	no
B	you can't see near
A	can you?
B	I can  I can  read now
A	okay
B	without my glasses
A	well apparently also I've got astigmatism
B	really?
A	so so I've got some problem with they reckon
B	it's all the reading you've been doing for the MA in
A	well maybe
B	oh no
A	and she said so so I've got varifocals
B	are these the ones you can just go into Boots and buy off the shelf?
A	well
B	Reading glasses or you have to go in for a prescription?
A	no because because she said there's some problem also with my right eye I think with distance
B	oh
A	she said do you have problems reading road signs? I said no not at all
B	no
A	and um two hundred and sixty
B	two hundred and sixty? Yeah I expected that
A	I had no idea
B	yeah
A	Cos I went in there and I thought that you know well as a student your eyesight is free
B	you got a student card?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no
B	really?
A	no
A	oh really? Oh
A	and then  and then and then  they said lenses start from eighty pound and I said well
B	yeah
A	it's not gonna be eighty pound it would probably be like a hundred pounds or something
B	and the frames?
A	well I had to reselect another pair I've gotta go back tomorrow and have a look
B	it's ridiculous
A	yeah
B	these might be especially varifocal
A	Cos he started off with vary varifocal
B	it's scary
A	yeah
B	the first way is a bit more painful
A	for the
B	it's cheap though
A	the second one is you saw it off with a knife
B	no exactly
A	no but that's what it would be
B	for eighty pound more you can get an anaesthetic
A	yeah
A	you can imagine it can't you?
B	that's what I call suspicious of the Conservatives because like my mum worked in NHS yes they do need reform you do see there's a lot of waste there going on
A	yeah
B	but that that's different from saying that's different from privatising it
A	from privatising it
B	you can reform something without privatising it in the way they might want to
A	yeah
B	along American lines
A	yeah local subsidies
B	yeah it would be very I don't think people would accept that though
A	but then you know how would we not accept it? How would we you know
B	people would
B	hmm
A	no there isn't any hope but
B	it would be it'd just be impossible wouldn't it? What would happen if we did have what it would be the school systems like that
A	right
B	and you still got and in the UK now you've got
A	well and then the school I well the school I went to
B	really?
A	it was  it was  a church school that that my parents paid for
B	and they paid for it?
A	yeah
B	ooh
A	but my brother  my brother  was a pain in the ass and an asshole and a trouble maker
B	A tearaway
A	yeah
B	yeah you pay for everything
A	you pay for everything
B	water
A	right
B	like at the
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know and these are kids in front of a class of kids and he was paid to go there and I suppose they'd only paid a little bit
A	ah
B	you get a system like that there
A	what you pay for is what you get
B	paper
A	and yeah yeah you can understand
B	so my my cousin's daughter in Kenya goes to a school where some of the kids don't have enough to eat in the morning
A	yeah
B	so my aunt from Australia who's going to Kenya to do some charity work like has organised a kitchen
A	hmm
B	and
A	hmm
B	because um to provide breakfast and lunch for these kids
A	hmm
B	get them in school
A	uh hmm
B	but they have like a huge gap between the elite schools which are like you know have a dash of
C	can you hold him?
A	yes
C	so I can get on with some stuff
B	aw is he sleeping now?
C	I washed his clothes
B	aw
A	I suppose so
B	aw he he sleeps very well after feeding
A	yeah it's nice isn't it?
B	mummy will wrap him up and
A	well people would give you money
B	I'll tell you what is so funny about people you know there's a wonderful old statue temperance you know the temperance statue? They get well you know they had alcohol problems this year that they put these free water fountains they were talking about
A	I didn't know
B	so there's one in you know the church on
A	yeah
B	and it's the only spot where all the winos hang up and the fountains of this
A	it is isn't it? The fountains stopped working long ago but the drunks are still here
B	but they sell those big beer cans for a pound
A	that is shocking like shocking I've I've often thought about that you know go past an off-licence
B	yeah
A	and
B	oh yeah
A	hmm
B	every time I go in there for my morning paper on Saturday or Sunday there's a you know there's an old drunk guy in there buying four for six cans of Tenants
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah it's just mad and then you get those litres and white lightening cider
B	type of people who buy that?
A	buy that
B	the stigma
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	whiskeys
B	just for show you know
A	yeah
B	it is a weird the situation isn't it? You can see a big bogey up there
A	you can suck it out
B	are we recording still? Ah
A	half an hour
B	but we shouldn't say that on the tape
A	I suppose not but it's an extra conversation
B	yeah he's put on about a kilo and a half since he's been born so em
A	how long when was he born nearly a month ago?
B	five weeks ago
A	five weeks
B	eh five weeks on Sunday about four and a half weeks ago
A	I was going to say what do they have what do they hear you know do they?
B	well they
A	what goes on in their heads?
B	most things of noise but they can if they need to sleep they can just shut it all out and sleep
C	well that's cos when they're in the womb they hear it already so they just get used to  used  to it
A	mm mm
B	nothing new it's just less muffled
C	yeah
B	what's funny though is like when you after he's fed
A	oh they do smell yeah
B	they smell buttery
A	well apparently we smell buttery anyway don't we?
B	but it with the breast milk he does
A	yeah
B	it's just a lovely rick
A	yeah
B	you could eat him
B	I give him a Maori greeting look
A	ah
B	do you know I'm sort of when I was there in New Zealand
A	did you notice many Maori people?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but a lot of them are mixed as well
A	yeah yeah and there's a lot of Pacific islanders
B	so they tend to be poorer or more working class cos there are ghettos up and Auckland and
A	yeah and apparently they there's there are sort of drug problems
B	yeah
A	which they kind of
B	have you seen that film Once We Were Warriors
A	no
B	with Tamerero Morrison
A	oh right
B	but he's a really really good actor that was about the Maori communities in Auckland
B	yeah and it's about eh it was actually about child abuse within the family there for
A	okay
B	but it was a very interesting film
A	was it
B	it was set
A	once We Were Warriors
B	yeah it's really famous
A	I've seen Whale Rider yeah yeah
A	hmm
B	those are two well most well-known Kiwi films
A	actually I that reminds me I've got a thing for Love Film you know that
B	oh no
A	well mm I probably have as well
B	oh is that online where you order online?
A	yeah you order online they send them to you send them through you get um you can watch them send them back
B	I might have a look at that
A	love Film
B	you've never used it
A	no I've got
B	oh so you can recommend someone
A	I can recommend someone and you you get like a month two months free
B	yeah do that yeah
A	well things like this you know so you get the obscure ones aren't like you know on television you can get hold of
B	yeah
A	I keep forgetting every time I see you to bring it  bring it  over
B	yeah no no do that
A	but this one particular guy
B	hmm
A	my friend's girlfriend was doing it
B	oh?
A	but he was obviously gay
B	hmm
A	and I thought it thought mm
B	be it might be true it might in this in
A	well it might not be yeah
B	in other cultures it's not
A	I mean I don't know it was
B	yeah yeah they do
A	must be a
B	was he really?
A	the phonetics of camp was he
A	not too
B	how funny
A	yeah
B	and the
A	it is yeah
B	faster than me I used to do a teacher's cup there used to be a teacher couple of teachers in the town I was teaching in in China and I had a really strong New Zealand accent
A	yeah and they actually write it now in some places I suppose cos they go and
B	no they don't
A	yeah when they're emphasising that
B	oh really the combination ah right
A	I think they realised that's its
B	all all our sports teachers at school in London were itinerant Australians and Kiwis
A	they're mad on outside things aren't they?
B	we had a lot of them
A	I suppose you would be I mean
B	we had a lot of
A	tipodean
B	antipodeans
A	cats
A	are South Africans are they considered as antipodeans?
B	I think they are because it's a similar accent
A	I thought it meant a place
B	I don't know I think it means southern hemisphere? But that it's interesting that it's a similar accent isn't it the?
A	yeah
B	is it to do with the magnetic magnetism of the southern pole?
A	yeah
B	does that affect the voice?
A	I don't know
B	because why is it the South African accent so similar and why is American not like that?
A	you know do you think it's to do with the
B	Cos a lot of Irish went to Australia
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so why isn't the Australian accent similar to the American which it does sound very Irish
B	these these are the really interesting things about linguistics aren't they?
A	mm
B	and socially but but
A	no I've not heard any
B	and it's nice isn't it?
A	well I suppose you got to be careful where you start doing things like that because people sort of accuse you of all kind of
B	well
B	well
A	I would
B	really?
A	and it was weird because there was a box with nothing in it was it wasn't a tick box
B	what was your form for?
A	I can't remember it was some to
B	but it's weird being
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no it's not because you're either white British white Irish or go to bloody hell sort of thing
B	and white white doesn't mean anything anyway
A	White doesn't mean anything you know and and and and and but so so what I mean is if you're forced to tick a box you
B	I always other or put mixed
A	well you see I was actually thinking should I just write in the box other
B	yeah
A	you know
B	I suppose
B	Cos how would you describe
A	yeah
B	you got an Irish yeah
A	yeah yeah I mean what what what I always put mixed other cos it's true
B	british those darn boxes I don't know but it's not
A	but they're they're not
B	and I'm not Anglo-Indian cos my mum's not completely Indian
A	right
B	her mum was not Indian
A	well there you go she was born in
B	but
A	oh
B	I wouldn't  I wouldn't  even say she was ever Indian
A	we should start writing a
B	okay if they wanna know
A	yeah yeah
B	so what was interesting is that when we were in Brixton in em Costa Coffee which is very nice new Costa Coffee they've built under the railway arches
A	yeah why?
B	what's ethnicity? Are they gonna see ooh you know en Anglo-Saxons signing up for our
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean what will they do with that information? It's totally irrelevant in that context so I mean you know the government's is obsessed with it
A	yeah yeah
B	okay they want to know if discrimination is happening or or they want to know if certain ethnicities lives in a particular area
A	right
B	so it can provide I don't know language service
A	yeah
B	it doesn't tell you um
A	it is really
B	obsessed was that
A	so that was a box ticking thing or or a space left?
B	no it's a space left cos you've got to bloody
A	that's what I mean it's impossible to do it really? If you're  if you're  a living conscious being
B	yeah
A	if you're a philistine and you think ah I want to be Black Caribbean then it's you know easy to fill in isn't it? And I want to be white British
B	yes
A	you know it's easy but if you actually think well hang on a minute
B	that's the thing isn't it?
A	I'm not in the National Front
B	that's the thing with research isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you've got
A	quite
B	didn't we have this discussion with
C	open
B	yeah and then what would you do with that? Cos
A	well I suppose this is it it's not isn't it it's put a
B	it it it it yeah
B	so you could divide the box somehow
A	yeah but if they wanted to  what would they say? Oh we got a lot of others
A	ooh we're all others
B	start a campaign
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	none of the above
A	none of the above
B	oh yeah did you see that? It's a great film isn't it? I love that  I love that film
A	it's brilliant
B	and he was  And John Candy
A	yes
B	yes they worked well together didn't they? Cos he was just such a nut case in that film
A	yeah brilliant
B	I love the bit when eh what is it? They go they get into the hotel and the top floor's already taken
A	yeah and it's into
B	it's it's it's a remake of an original
A	oh is it?
B	the original was made in the fifties or something
A	ah
B	and in the end he just makes it and he has to spend thirty thousand in
B	and he buys that stamp and sends it
C	yeah
B	em cos it's postmarked is it not
A	oh yeah it's not worth anything
B	Great isn't it?
A	no it's a good film
B	yeah well well none of the above
A	well quite yeah because how would that  how would that  fit you know do you have to then explain if you tick other do you have to explain what other is?
B	well that's the thing you don't sometimes
A	but would you cos you know when you  when you  fill in a landing card and it says nationality as stated on your passport so that you don't start saying you know
B	Cos your nationality doesn't mean ethnicity
A	no exactly yeah
B	but some people take it to mean nationality
A	and I was thinking the other day about racism
B	yeah
A	I don't like your ethnic group
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	or Muslim ethnicity
A	A Muslim or
B	but that's not
A	mm
B	but you'd be surprised if you asked people even university professors
A	right
B	some people take ethnicity not to mean genetic ancestry but they mean religion
A	yeah
B	belief
A	yeah
B	but that's totally fluid isn't it?
A	hmm
B	it's all just confused
A	thank goodness for cake really
B	yes
A	ooh that's nice that drink
B	ooh
A	go on have some more  have some more  ice
B	have some more
A	I'm okay for now I'm a bit full actually Roy
B	well that's good
A	have we? It's good though isn't it?
B	I can splice though
A	can you?
A	the first few minutes if they were rude and then continue
A	are we going out in the garden?
B	yeah we can do? Cos we could do another one out there
A	yeah
B	I'll just get the mat so you can sit down on it
A	okay

C	hmm
B	he's he's got two blankets around him and it's nineteen outside
B	it's probably warmer outside than it is in here
A	and he doesn't need the bathing suit
B	I'm sure we'll just put his hat on
A	seating mat
B	let's have look
C	you want to take a suit
A	picnic mat
C	yeah mm hm
B	we'll go to sit outside

B	yes
B	Cos it could be a sun shade for him
A	oi
A	Cos doesn't black absorbs heat
C	I do
B	see I'm thinking
A	have you made a dog pool what's going on here?
