B	yeah
C	anyway
B	mm
C	and his face could've been airbrushed
B	wow
C	big blue eyes
B	mm

B	mm
C	that type
B	to me
C	I was

B	why can't you have both? I just don't understand where these men are
C	I know
B	mm
C	gorgeous face no brains
B	yeah
C	that's it
B	or brains but you wouldn't wanna kiss them
C	or brains but you wouldn't wanna kiss them
B	tut
C	it seemed to be that you got one or the other
B	yeah
B	I think it's because anyone that you would actually date is already in a relationship
B	you know
C	yeah
B	happy days
C	happy days
B	anyone you'd actually think about considering
C	so it was huh
B	isn't available
C	it was really gutting
B	mm
C	very disappointed
B	so the I've
C	to the point where I er I was actually considering how much of a stalker it would be for me to ask him to take a photograph
C	yeah
B	he might actually have you arrested
C	well yeah of course I wouldn't have actually gone through with it
B	mm
C	photograph him
B	mm
C	like it would be
B	yeah
C	pretty plausible
B	yeah
C	he was gorgeous
B	it er
C	like he could've easily made a living out of it
B	that might well be
C	he was like stunning
B	mm
C	you think?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	I mean I like to think he didn't
C	yeah
B	who can say
C	yeah
B	person
C	mm
B	oh every time I look in my cupboard I see this little remnant of Mini Eggs wrapper and I think huh
C	uh
B	no
C	something really sweet today
B	oh God
C	he um he was saying that
B	aw
C	she was just so grateful that he wasn't hurt
B	yeah
C	how nice is that?
B	yeah
C	how nice is that? She values him so much
B	mm
C	that it wasn't oh my God are you alright? What happened? The story
B	thank God you're okay
C	I'll never ask you to pick your dirty socks up ever again
B	mm
C	how sweet
B	in the moment
C	well yeah
B	give it a few days
C	in real life
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	you stay there
C	yeah
B	Cos I've already said er when I got out of the shower I said well I
C	it's so hard to make that much of an allowance with someone isn't it
B	well it's I know it cos it's the  it's the  second time in a week where he's been like yeah I'll come over
C	now I've fucked it up
B	well I
C	yeah
B	like even if no matter how
B	you class it it's rude
C	and can you  can you  class it as rude if it's because he's ill?
B	huh
C	that's what I'm thinking
B	that's the problem
C	I would just smash his face against a wall
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	you
C	write it down  write it down  You know you're going write it on a piece of paper all over the flat
B	I don't know if it's just he's sat down and having a beer
C	but you can still tell someone
B	that's the thing
C	yeah
B	and he's like oh I just didn't think
C	yeah
B	a lack of consideration
C	yeah it is
B	yeah
C	at the risk of sounding perverse with my penis
B	oh thanks love
C	have you tried them on?
B	I haven't tried it on yet
C	Small ones
B	yeah
C	that is wise
B	mm
C	it wouldn't be as feminine
B	yeah
C	Cos the boy blazer makes it
B	Good
C	it came into my head
B	oh God
C	yeah
B	so I need to make an effort
C	yeah
B	okay
B	um to have my nails done
C	oo
B	tomorrow
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's just not fun times
C	no
C	I don't like the bread really crispy
B	oh okay
C	it's just got to be cooked enough for the butter to melt
B	so it's yeah so it is warm
C	no
B	Cos that would be  that would be  wrong
C	I think that should be about it
C	oh
B	when you said you were gonna eat the whole garlic bread I thought you meant like you're gonna eat both loaves
B	and in my head I was like that's quite a lot of garlic bread
C	that's a lot of bread
B	but then I was thinking actually I probably could eat a whole thing
C	you see the thing this is I used to get annoyed with my mum about this
B	mm?
C	like she knew she was forgetful
B	mm
C	yeah
B	people who are late or er people who just don't think
C	yeah
B	some extent
C	I don't have any patience with it at all
B	um
C	I think it's because I cannot believe truly believe that somebody could not think that
B	yeah
C	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
C	er there's no way on this planet that that didn't enter into your head to do and you chose not to do it as opposed to just didn't think
B	yeah
C	it came in your head
B	yeah
C	not that I didn't think
B	yeah
C	beer
B	oh nice
C	I'll rescue said beer
B	that's definitely necessary
C	should be cold enough now
B	yeah
C	mm
B	oh nice
C	por you madame
B	vielen Dank mon amie
B	it's just unbelievable
C	huh
B	think it might be
C	all the
B	all the learning
C	all the learning
B	it's necessary
C	all the learning
B	mm
B	shall we read about he set me on fire
C	yes
C	my
B	he set me on fire
C	I mean why wouldn't he set you on fire? Is obviously the next question
B	um
B	yes
C	really? It actually says that?
B	yeah
C	thought you were taking the mick
B	what the blazes? That's what the article's called
C	yep
B	Sunday morning
C	for breakfast
B	yep
C	sorry I forgot?
B	what the fuck is the matter with this kid? Look I'm not kidding
C	yeah
B	oh fuck off
C	so but I mean that that is a very very far-fetched story
B	no no
C	mm
B	that's er that's that's clearly what's happened
C	yeah
B	knowing that I was ready
C	why would you do that?
B	to eat dinner
C	yeah
B	mm
C	is send the message
B	he can fuck off
C	he's on his own planet  he's on his own planet
B	it's been ages
C	is the guy from next door?
B	no the guy is just the guy he works for
C	oh
B	like a contractor
C	oh
B	the guy that he was waiting home so that the guy who he's been doing a job for this week can come round and pay him
C	right
B	okay
C	right
B	and I was clearly saying right well you come round and then we'll get some food
C	sorry I'm on the way out
B	right okay
C	mm
B	frustration
C	is not that he said all this crap happened to him
B	yeah
C	in the first place
B	no
C	sometimes you feel a bit obliged to kind of go okay then
B	yeah
C	mm
C	even once to accept it to know then then you're gonna turn up to see your mates stoned when you're not stoned when
B	yeah
C	she isn't
B	yeah
C	so the best will in the world if he didn't think it was gonna touch him there was no point in doing it
B	yeah
C	and if it did he knows that at least for an hour no matter how little he smokes he's stoned
B	yeah
C	mm
B	no
C	but if he come round now are you only gonna say it to his face anyway?
B	mm
C	yeah
B	I wanna understand why he
C	yeah
B	why he did it
C	make him take the shit to his face then
B	does it?
C	yeah
B	have you got enough to share? Are you sure?
C	oh yeah
B	definitely full
C	no thank you
B	mm
C	if he's whitied he's gonna be sick for ages yet ain't he?
B	well yeah
C	and the problem is it then makes you into the bad person
B	yeah
C	of being the person to put up the guns all the time
B	the one who gets annoyed
C	yeah
B	mm
C	no
B	no
C	argumentative or
B	no
C	mm mm
B	speaking of
C	mhm
B	at the party
B	thanks
C	yep
B	I'd only popped round to drop off a top I'd borrowed
C	does he mean yeah he wants a lift? What's the message you sent again?
B	I'm sorry you're feeling sick
C	yep
B	you might have to come in the car so I don't murder him
B	I'll tell I'll
C	yeah
B	I loved my hair
C	on sad note
B	note that
C	yeah
B	but now Music Channel was on the TV playing chart songs
C	right
B	huh
B	eruption
C	I don't really understand the link between the hair-doing
B	mm mm
C	ah
B	Mate dig in
B	Cos
C	mm
B	yeah
C	oh no it's good
B	it's alright isn't it
C	people laughing
B	it had clearly been a good night
C	mm
B	I knew most of the people there
C	how old is she? Have we has she told us yet?
B	no
C	she hasn't told us yet has she
B	child
C	yeah
B	well when she wrote this
C	yep
B	everything I said he'd make some kind of quip
C	mm
B	I'd been yanked
C	so she didn't put herself out? She rung her mum?
B	she rang her mum
C	right
B	not nine nine nine
C	head in the sink
B	not run down the road
C	first bit of water you'd be there
B	run the bath
C	yeah
B	even
C	you'd go to the bathroom
B	you would
C	wherever you are
B	yeah
C	whether it's just a sink in there or even a toilet
B	yeah
C	wouldn't you
B	get someone to pee on you
B	so the fact that your head's on fire probably tells people that you can't really stop and chat
C	yep
B	minutes later a police car and an ambulance arrived
B	whoever it was had shaved part of
B	only part of it
C	yep
B	mum told me in the hospital
C	no
B	her head was on fire
B	you probably wouldn't tell her
C	insult to injury
C	by the way you've only got half a right eyebrow
B	in the grand scheme of things
C	Don't worry about it
B	back at home I looked at myself in my bedroom mirror and broke down
C	what the hell was wrong with
B	she was probably off shagging someone
C	oo
B	bleurgh
C	no
B	it was done as a prank
C	yeah
B	it also stopped everyone else staring at me
C	yeah
B	with an aerosol
C	what?
B	the hospital specialist was given has given me special cream to try and reduce the scarring but I may need plastic surgery if they don't work
C	jeebus
B	who does that?
C	cock ain't he
B	often they have a statement from the person um sadly
C	er
B	you can read this one
C	oh
C	you do look pretty bad mum
C	uh
C	why would you do that?
B	more Ms please
C	mm
B	of course she did
C	would it work? I don't think so
B	mm mm
C	my eyes opened
C	burned by the shock of the daylight
C	my head was thundering with pain and I could smell vomit
B	uh
C	yep
B	yep
C	she was the only one who ever visited me these days
B	mm
C	I don't want to bury you mum
C	I love it how
C	I was still too drunk to say a word
B	man up mum
C	ten years oh ten years earlier
B	hm
C	maybe we'll find she's traumatized
B	what?
C	yes
C	Good times

C	yeah
B	mm
C	just really suddenly

B	mm
C	yep
B	slippery slope
C	yep
B	tut tut tut tut
C	eventually
B	mm
C	um
C	and failure heaped on top of depression I started drinking three
B	mm
C	she's out of
B	mm
C	no more sherry
B	Good stuff
C	I started drinking three litre bottles of cider until they were empty too
B	mm
C	yeah
B	mm
C	might've been a tell-tale sign
B	probably not good for dinner
C	no
B	for like three-year-olds
C	mm
B	Don't think it's good parenting necessarily
C	Good parenting
C	I collapsed at home unconscious and spent two weeks in a coma in hospital
B	from the three bottles of cider
C	from
B	surprised
C	yep
B	is she dead?
C	Don't think she's dead
B	has she got any liver left?
C	you've got five years left
C	but it was an alcoholic and er I was an alcoholic and a few months on the urge
B	are you gonna eat this love?

C	basically
B	all away
C	what's happened here? I mean she's in a bit of a something over there
C	er
B	huh
B	what? Wait
C	three litres of vodka
B	not per day? Surely?
C	standard binge
B	oh my God
C	and drink until I hit oblivion
B	mm
C	yeah
B	or it could  it could  be twenty-four hours but still
C	one time I'd woken up face down on the lounge floor
B	charming
B	mm
C	I watched her weakly
B	not so much
C	no
B	mm
C	so there
B	mm
C	of course my good intentions didn't last
B	yep

B	there's quite a lot of those isn't there
C	six years' worth
B	when your kids needed you
C	anyway
