A	yeah so I've still got lots of homework to do
B	oh dear
A	yeah
B	and not many days before you go back
A	no well I say homework it's just revision
B	mm
A	erm but yeah and it but today even I've got to do some more Ted Hughes
B	oh okay what are you
A	I need to analyse more of the animal poems cos I need to have read and know a bit about all of those and I need to find links between them so I can talk about the collection
B	oh okay
A	oh my god I was analysing animal poems the other day and oh it is just interminably dull
A	ah
B	ah
A	I can't I can't stand it it's just he's just oh the pike did this it's like oh
A	I don't care the only good animal poem I read was called the bee god and that was because it was about Sylvia
B	oh right okay
B	erm
A	oh I'm sure they do
B	but you just haven't
A	they are not very interesting ones
A	because he's all about like erm
B	mm
A	and er it's it's about you know glorifying how great these animals are and how great their connections to the real world are whereas we're all like da da da
A	like the Jaguar is quite
B	like do you find it disconnected?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the Jaguar is quite good because that's about that's got all like this prison imagery and then it's all really good but
B	right
A	some of it some of it's a bit
B	right right a bit over the top
A	yeah it's like okay I get it
B	right right
A	maybe
B	and be more revealing
A	yeah
B	because of their connection with animals and the importance of animals
A	mm yeah perhaps
A	also if they you know liked poetry
A	yeah kind of sometimes
B	right
A	he just plays around with stuff he he tends to have like quite a strict form though
B	does he? yeah
A	yeah although the the crow poems are more like experimental and out there but
B	right
A	and they were interesting but this is not
B	no what's his set form tend to be then?
A	oh he has like different forms for different poems
B	oh I see
A	but they tend to like er like a lot of poets will like break form for effect
B	right
A	whereas he is a more traditional poet
B	right right yeah
A	so yeah yeah
B	mm
B	have you studied any Sylvia Plath yet?
A	no I think we do next year though
B	oh that'll be interesting
A	yeah I've got an anthology that I think belonged to Miss
B	oh really?
B	oh interesting
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so that will be fun
B	yeah
A	oh I've just clicked my hip
B	oh was that what that that was?
A	that's what that was
B	oh my goodness girl you are breaking down
A	yeah
B	yeah it is
A	oh that's strange
B	there was an unexpected sound coming from my body that must hurt
A	oh
B	oh
A	yeah
B	it's it's crazy really if you think about it that you know you went through what the last two years and it just seemed to be nonstop
A	I know
B	yes and then you thought you know okay finish school finish revising for all those exams and you literally have just finished your second term
A	yeah
B	and you you're already going into a another exam
A	it's the middle of year it's the middle of the year in terms of exams
A	yeah but then yeah so
B	less than three months in
A	well it's September October November December no it's four months by the time I go back
B	well that's true yeah it is yeah yeah yeah
A	and then you've got January February March April and then May I start having exams
B	god it's mad isn't it it's just round after round you'd've thought it's like give some leverage here
B	yeah no I know
B	but you know your your other exams were important as well
A	yeah but do
B	mm
A	who've who are in
B	well they don't if you haven't if you haven't done very well in them and you've managed to scrape through in your A levels yeah
A	no but even yeah other people oh oh there's like it's weird because there was a big sort of competition between when you are at you're at school people going you've got to get these GCSEs because
B	yeah
A	they stay with you for the rest of your
B	yeah
A	they are super important and then once like once you are out people will be like GCSEs don't matter that much A Levels are more important
B	yeah but they matter in in the greater scheme of things don't they?
A	but yeah
B	how quickly yeah as well yeah
A	yeah it kind of switches to people being like that
B	it's almost like oh they have to say how important they are otherwise you would never get through school you know you'd never
A	oh yeah no I think they are important but it's just a bit like
B	yeah
A	oh well just all that work and then you get
B	yeah but you're you're the one that's going to have on your CV or whatever you know ten A star A
B	er GCSEs
A	yeah
B	which count for a lot actually which say a lot you know it's er yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	so when you come to do your exam entries and you get your UCAS points your
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	points are equated from your exam
A	yeah
B	results they are just on your A levels?
A	I don't actually know
B	you see that would be interesting to know
A	yeah I did wonder because I looked it up once
B	yeah
A	I don't know because you do like if you look at erm the sheet you get I'm sure it tells you how many UCAS points all your
B	mm
A	but I don't know if they count them when they are
B	yeah well
A	doing stuff like if you go to a university league table it will often tell you the erm the average amount of UCAS points an entrant there has
B	right
A	and I don't know whether that includes their GCSE points it must do because some of them are so high like
B	it must do
A	yeah
B	they do count
A	yeah yeah but
B	I know you do
A	yeah
B	and you believe that anyway
A	yeah
B	but you know for all those doubters out there
A	yeah but erm yeah
B	no no no they say a minimum of whatever at A level don't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and sometimes like
B	yeah
A	but erm yeah what was I gonna say?
B	oh they are very important aren't they?
A	they are like
B	for your applications
A	yeah
B	so are they going through that at college?
A	not yet I think they will do
B	I think they will be yeah
A	yeah and
B	oh yeah yeah
B	right
A	and then get feedback from teachers and stuff when I go back
B	that's good that's good
A	yeah
B	and erm the fact that you've got extra input from
A	yeah it's good
B	so
A	hadn't the term like already started or something?
B	yes it had it had so er I I know I must have done a personal statement but I can't for the life
A	I am brilliant
A	yeah
B	let's just chuck it in and see what happens erm and it really was very late well it must have been September that I did it
A	yeah like how?
A	yeah
B	my tutor who was good friends with the head of school
A	who was your tutor? where were they from?
B	it was er
A	yeah but how did you know him?
B	he was my er tutor for my HND my multimedia HND because I did a two year
A	oh I thought you were talking about getting into your HND
B	oh no no no no I was talking about my university place at
A	what was your university place for?
B	multimedia
A	what was your HND? where where did you where did you do your HND?
A	I don't even remember that
A	that's probably why I don't remember it there
A	oh it was all just one thing for me
B	yeah no
A	yeah
B	and erm I'd already started a college course in
A	oh
B	it was the first year that they ever did it it because it was you know multimedia it was all new and exciting
A	yeah
B	erm this was er
A	yeah
B	yeah I don't know it was before you were born anyway I started erm a HNC in multimedia and it was the first year that
A	uhu
B	and
A	mm
B	and er
A	yeah
B	when you were a baby you were a few months old er and we decided it would be really nice to move to
A	yeah
B	that you were born
A	yeah
B	that they had a multimedia course and he turned out to be my course tutor
B	erm and he was really you know passionate about the course it was
A	yeah
B	the first year they were running it as well
A	around yeah
B	so I just popped down to see him one day after we'd moved in the summer
B	it was really informal and
A	yeah hop on board
B	er and and like you know his interview of me was really more a tour of the facilities and you know just showing me things and just chatting really really erm really nice and er I got he was so passionate about it all so
A	right
B	and the biggest thing was that they had the equipment
B	they had a full Mac studio they had all the software software that you know
B	what a surprise
A	yeah it was like woah this is like really proper this is going to be kicking it you know and so then I started in the September but I had to go through all the
B	yeah
A	so erm so that was great so one of the tutors that was then on that course erm
A	mm
B	everything was working out in terms of looking after you and kind of all
A	uhu
B	and it was all really fitted into place
A	mm
B	and erm so I asked if I could transfer then and I transferred to the HND so I literally had loads of catching up to do at the end of that first year to get up to the standard of the
A	yeah
B	first year HND and I
A	yeah to get into it yeah
B	yeah erm and then when
A	mm
B	and then the second year did that and then at the end of that
A	yeah
B	really for various reasons things that were happening
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	so it literally was yeah
A	ah
B	I literally
A	yeah
B	you know all the rest of it and er
A	yeah
B	various you know form
A	forms
B	bits but yeah I was certainly fast tracked through
A	you must have been good
A	yeah
B	absolutely crazy but yeah but it all worked out
A	good
B	in fact I think I actually I did I actually started my college day that day as well because the first lesson that I had was in a group project
A	mm
B	and so you had we were working with other teams so we were working with people who were on the sound engineering degree people who were on the graphic design degrees so they'd mixed you know the students
A	right
B	up to produce a team multiples to do a game so I literally walked into this lesson they'd already had a group formed but suddenly there I was I think it was the second lesson if you like
B	erm
A	thrown in the deep end
B	and it was like oh er you know and it was a bit awkward for the group because they'd already figured out what they were doing
A	what they were doing
B	but it turned out to be really good and it was with
A	ah
B	Irish
B	so two multimedia students and a 3D guy whereas other teams you know
A	had graphics and sound
B	yeah so we were trying to
A	yeah
B	which was fine because we ended up doing loads of sound in the studio at home we were able to record lots daddy helped out
A	ah
B	you know with setting it up for us
A	yeah
B	so that we could just produce our sound samples and effects and everything
A	yeah
B	erm it worked out really well
A	yeah
B	and he was like no no it's alright you know I'll
A	bits
B	carrots if you like of just er static images frames taken from his 3D renders because 3D renders take forever to render you know and er so it was like oh yeah you know so I I think he just kept feeding us with those but all along he was a million miles away from finishing
A	yeah right at the
B	saying right until that night no don't worry I've got them it's fine
A	yeah
B	jazzed up a bit animated stuff that needed to be that we'd done from 2D graphics rather than 3D graphics
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	I was gonna say did you test it?
B	however we then had to put it on the uni
A	oh my god
B	we literally we had fifteen a fifteen-minute window where we realised oh
A	oh no yeah
A	you just bypass like worrying and stuff and just
A	just into that mechanic just do it mode
B	it was exactly that you've got it spot on and er and so
B	it was just mad erm and the fact that we'd had to just present it ourselves and we had no other help we got a like equivalent of a first for it for our group project
A	yeah cos you'd just had so many trials group project more like duo project
A	oh my god well like well like the the people who like ran the the course what were their reactions
B	yes yes
A	to the fact that all these people had left?
A	yeah
B	bad although you know they knew that the the earlier sound people had dropped out
A	yeah
B	because we'd we'd continued on and
A	yeah
B	er you had different points where you checked in with them on the project anyway so you know
A	yeah
B	they knew we were doing the sounds on our own and you know
A	yeah
B	kind of gave a little bit of advice as well on that the sound guy although he was
A	yeah
B	you know erm give you feedback and I think it was
B	they had put all of this together pretty much of you know and the quality of what they've done when they're not
A	yeah
B	even either 3D graphics sound or whatever
A	yeah
B	you know er I mean they have a marking scheme that they have to compare
A	yeah
B	to but the sound guy was oh I don't know he was really negative so we were like
B	you know this isn't going very well sort of thing but actually we did we got a first
A	he got a bit overruled then
B	yeah
A	they were like come on now
B	but yeah I'll never forget that oh gosh I'm trying to remember the name of the game though
A	what what was the game?
B	it was erm
A	far far away
B	and then zooming in into this spaceship so we had the visual from his 3Ds of the spaceship that we'd like flattened and then er did a it was like a hatch door erm that you heard the
A	yeah
B	the weaponry
A	but that was about it though he threw you some words
B	he threw us some words that's it
B	yeah he did yeah he he did drop out
A	why did he spend all that time just lying?
B	I know I know
A	did you ever see him again?
B	I think we did actually I think we saw him once
A	I bet that was fun
A	right
B	so
A	yeah
B	but yeah he did he
B	no no
A	blimey
B	anyway
A	woah
B	so took you on a
A	on a journey
B	I know
A	I've done a
B	yeah
A	I've just had to go right we are doing this you are saying this
A	I'm just going to write it all and you are going to say this and you are going to do this
B	what because they are not offering up? they are not doing what they should be doing? yeah
A	mm and sometimes I have ended up you know pulling other people's weight a bit bit too much but you know
B	too much
A	mm
A	somebody to like with presentations they are like so who is going to speak?
A	like even at college erm we had to do something in form and we had to like present our ideas to some other forms and erm
A	and it's quite funny I don't mind that much though but I I kind of like
B	oh
A	yeah I take it on because I'm like
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I might as well do it because I know I can sort of do it alright so
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you've had so much experience of it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	is er with
B	oh yes
A	he's just you just can't
B	yeah yeah
A	his way or the highway like to an extreme
B	right yeah
A	but erm
B	yeah
A	yeah I might see a bit more of that if I'm going to a competitive uni
B	yes yeah that's true yes
A	which could be nice because people might be more willing to
B	yeah
A	you know
B	and that will help you I mean it would be good if if that did happen because that will then give you more skills in in you know how to handle that competitive
A	yeah
B	kind of nature because if you know if you've naturally always at school by default been the person leading
A	yeah
B	you know there are other skills that you need to also learn in order to be able to get by in that competitive environment
A	yeah
B	in the side lines
A	yeah
B	back room
A	but it always ends up you know when when I'm not immediately looked as the leader we get a really terrible leader who then just doesn't do anything and so then I end up sort of
B	yeah
A	like I remember on
B	right
A	and it was like come on and he didn't
B	yeah
A	so he
B	right
A	and so the rest of us were just like oh well
B	yeah
A	what do we do? so I said well if I do this bit you do this bit you do that bit and you do that that bit and we'll get on with it and so we did and then sort of
B	right yeah
A	I think I've told probably told you about this but we did a presentation and the leader guy was just coming up with all this stuff that he'd never
B	what random stuff?
A	yeah that he'd never mentioned he hadn't done anything for the whole time
A	and he never mentioned any of this and then he was just saying things that were obviously just not going to work
A	and so I remember just sort of covering him and being like well obviously that would be the ideal situation
A	but it was so bad cos we were presenting so it was like
B	yeah yeah
A	you can't have an argument whilst presenting but that's ridiculous
A	but I think everyone else in my team was kind of on my side and just what are you doing?
A	but somebody made a really great model cos we had to we had to make a games console that's it
B	oh yes
A	and
B	mm
A	and he just made this amazing model it was the best model out of any of them
B	woah
A	out of this cardboard and stuff and it was just great
B	yeah yeah
A	so that was like yeah we've got a great model we might have a terrible pitch but look how pretty it looks
A	yeah that's what it was like
B	is it February? oh January when in January is it?
A	January
B	oh is it? and are you
A	er three days
B	three days
A	so it will be like I don't know if it's Monday to Wednesday or Wednesday to Friday
B	right
A	yeah
B	oh yeah it would be a bit tricky if it was over the weekend wouldn't it?
A	er yeah yeah it's not over the weekend
B	mind you
B	you've got one in the bag there
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	if those people that take on that leadership team fail
A	yeah
B	helping get through it they don't necessarily get the full impact of where they went wrong
A	yeah yeah yeah oh right yeah yeah
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	so erm like those two guys who completely you know didn't do anything
A	yeah
B	and then just fronted it out at the end to a really ridiculous degree er the yeah
A	I remember the assessor being like afterwards when we were talking about it she was like well done for taking on the leadership role there
A	like you were really doing well from behind the scenes so I was very obvious but like yeah I was like oh thank you but they
A	I hadn't a I
B	he he got what?
A	he got kicked out
B	he got kicked out? oh
A	yeah because he was he he just wasn't
B	did he?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then I think I don't know if
B	right so natural wastage there then
B	so it kind of came round in the end anyway by the sounds of it
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	for people in some things
B	people more willing to sort of speak up and
A	yeah there's normally like at least a couple in like and because obviously you are in different classes
B	yeah
A	you don't get so much of a reputation for being that one who who gives the answers
B	ah yeah yeah of course yeah
A	but I I guess you do to
B	mm
A	I can think of at least like one or two other people who always give answers
B	yeah
A	as well
B	yeah yeah
A	English literature not so much
B	oh right mm
A	but a bit
B	I mean it's different dynamics as well isn't it you know
A	yeah
B	sort of when you are moving from class to class and so you know when you're going through in one class the majority of your lessons like you were in secondary school there are set patterns that everybody falls into isn't there you know
A	yeah
B	and relationships and you know
A	yeah
B	erm alliances or or whatever
A	yeah
B	whereas if you're mixing it up a lot
A	yeah
B	that helps
A	no in some of my classes like in English language
B	mm
A	like if she asks a question and then there's a long silence like I I will often have the answer but I will wait a little while to see if anyone else
B	yeah
A	will say it
B	yeah yeah
A	and then I'll just go well obviously not
B	yeah
A	I don't know because it changes
B	right
A	but it's either drama or English lit
A	it depends what we are doing in drama as well
B	yeah
A	where yeah and it would depends what book we are doing in English lit like A Room with a View is like woah
B	yeah happy days
A	but erm Ted Hughes less so we've still got to do Streetcar Named Desire
B	mm when are you supposed to be doing that then? when you go back or?
A	yeah it must be because we are doing it after A Room with a View and we are like we've got like one chapter left of A Room with a View
B	right yeah
A	so we'll be doing that then but it's quite short A Streetcar Named Desire I need to read it
B	right yeah
A	oh bound to
B	Marlon was it Marlon? was Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire?
A	I don't know I saw we saw some clips of it on a taster day
B	or am I getting it muddled up?
A	don't know
B	Tennessee Williams did he do?
A	Tennessee Williams wrote it yeah
B	yeah did he do Cat on a Hot Tin Roof as well?
A	yeah I think so
B	right so it's kind of deep south sort of
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah from the little I know of it yeah
B	Cat on a Hot a Hot Tin Roof is really good it's got so much tension in it
A	right
B	yeah mm
A	it's a funny old title
B	yes
A	you are like say titles so many times they just lose their meaning
B	yeah yeah
A	it's quite
B	well
