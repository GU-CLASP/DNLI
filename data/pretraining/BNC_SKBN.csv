A	a
C	yeah you just put you put your mobile up to the bark or something or the leaf and then it'll tell you what it is
A	I reckon you have to look at the leaf don't you? isn't that how they the botanists work out
C	mm
A	off the leaf?
C	I suppose there might be a few give er giveaways bark and the fruits and the
A	and the seeds things
C	conkers
A	cos there's an oak tree you

C	yeah
A	what did you get
B	I think the
A	yours done in Asia?
B	my feet are no I'd get my money's worth here because it's my feet are such hard work
C	you would
A	they have to really kinda
B	filing them and scrubbing them for one and a half hours
A	oh okay
C	oh well you
A	so what you pay
C	should have seen what happened to
A	pay a flat fee?
B	yeah
C	to the Chinese pedicure
B	yeah
C	they had to take out erm they had to take out a flame thrower
C	to burn off burn off the bottom of his
B	cos you
C	his sole
C	yeah cos it was like a
A	cos it was so dead it was all dead
B	yeah
C	they burnt it off it was the quickest way
B	burnt it off?
C	yeah they
B	where was that? did they
A	er no no they they
C	they did or they
A	no
C	and I'll tell you what they
A	they used the flame
C	did they
A	the er they used this they had like a proper chisel tool
B	where?
C	in China in Chean
B	oh yeah oh yeah that one
A	this razor sharp chisel right?
B	yeah I know it's really sharp yeah
A	and they used the the
B	yeah
A	flame thrower to to like
B	yeah
A	sterilise the chisel
B	yeah
C	and then they
A	yeah
C	just
B	I've had it in China
C	burnt burnt burnt this
A	but they basically just use this one bit knife thing
B	yeah
A	to cut everything
B	oh
C	it's scary
B	what like like peeling an orange
A	so they do your toenails
C	yeah
A	and they
C	oh
A	cos they kind of
C	it's scary
A	scrape the skin off you and
C	it's such a scary thing
B	but they do it
A	such a weird
C	they are good at it his feet were like little baby feet at the end
B	my my woman's
C	what did she do?
B	industrial
A	ah
B	to take all the
C	she put it on your
B	hard skin off
C	on off the off the bottom of your
B	yeah
C	foot?
B	yeah
C	of the sole?
B	yeah
C	oh
B	and then I had it done in Singapore and erm I was looking at it my god how much skin came off
C	really?
B	and the woman says do you wanna take it home and make soup?
C	oh my god
B	such a
C	oh
B	for you
C	oh
A	oh no
C	oh
A	oh that's horrible
C	er you never know
C	with them though
A	yeah
C	do you? whether they're laugh
B	yeah
C	into a soup
A	oh imagine what they'd do with all the bits of leftover
C	oh they're probably gonna burn it
A	well you know like what do hairdressers do with all the extra hair that they have?
C	I dunno actually
A	it must be really weird
B	if you put it around the garden it keeps cats away
C	really?
B	yeah
A	is that like leaving bottles of water so the dogs don't crap on your lawn?
B	why would that work?
A	oh it's how they do it in New Zealand they
B	really?
A	just take a clear bottle of water
B	yeah?
A	like a full bottle of water
B	yeah
A	and just lay it out on the grass
B	yeah
A	and dogs won't piss there
B	why?
A	or shit there I dunno
B	that's amazing
A	I don't know but that's how that's what happens
B	but maybe they
A	if you don't want any
A	don't want a dog to crap on your lawn that's what you should do
B	put a plastic bottle of water
A	just put a plastic bottle of water out
B	oh my god that's amazing
A	yeah
C	I don't think it's quite a tried and tested method of that though so
B	I wish it were would
A	oh it is it's well they use it everywhere
B	but how do they deal deal with cats then?
A	oh cats you just shoot
C	yeah handgun
A	well if there er if there's a cat around you've got gotta look for the witches don't you? so
C	mm
B	well you know what I did to keep the slugs away which worked?
C	what?
B	I made a
A	salt them
B	no I tried that but then
A	yeah
B	you need a lot of salt right and you have to confine them and then kill them with salt which is not very pleasant
C	yeah
B	and I filled it with ash
C	oh yeah?
B	cos I
C	that would do it
B	I was thinking they can't cross
A	and they can't cross over
B	and it worked
A	the dry ash thing
B	yeah it worked
A	hey that's a great idea
B	yeah
A	brilliant
B	put beer in and they fall in and drown and it's like but I don't want them
A	yeah I know you don't want
B	I don't wanna deal with them
A	don't want them at all
C	yeah
B	I just don't want them to come here
A	well of course they're not gonna
B	no
A	just get clogged up
B	yeah it worked
A	it would be like
C	so they
A	they'll be making concrete on their foot
C	so they just slug off
B	yeah
C	the other way
B	yeah it worked
A	wow
B	yeah
A	hey that's a really good idea that
B	yeah
A	I like that
B	so are you gonna help me with my flowers tomorrow then? with er pegging
