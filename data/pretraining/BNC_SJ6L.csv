A	so now this is it? starting
B	right now you say evaluating just to clarify what are
A	there there are two things that I'm I'm evaluating
B	yeah
A	your erm job as a unit convener
B	okay
A	and that's one of the questions
B	sure
B	okay sure
A	now actually that is the first question
B	right
A	can you tell me a little bit about your previous position before starting at
B	er okay so I'm a bit of a unique
A	okay so tell me about evaluation in that if were you involved what did you erm you know have second-hand experience with people?
B	the evaluation of what?
A	of whatever the business was so you know when you were working in recruitment or when you were working in you know your dad's company you know
B	right recruitment was pretty simple in the sense that did we find people for the specific jobs? and you'd evaluate you know and you'd know yourself if you found a good quality person because these were executive level jobs we're talking like two hundred thousand dollars minimum that's what we dealt in all the way up to about a million erm as a base salary and er so I was actually part of team and we'd all sort of basically pitch in depending er the the structure of it was pretty easy we had sort of one main person and there was like three or four quite
A	what kind of evaluation techniques were you using?
B	oh very subjective
A	right
B	because it's it's it's so subjective right? you can't er
A	okay that's fine that's that's good that's good to know so second question
B	mm mm
A	what sorts of evaluation activities oh no what sorts of evaluation activities are you currently involved in as a convener for your for your unit?
B	what sort of evaluation activities? very formal LEU LETs which I actually have down there ready and rocking for the unit er and I'm doing that across
A	mm sure and what's the difference between LETs and L
B	oh right
A	whatever exactly is the word
B	okay so
A	right
B	alright and LETs are learning evaluations of teaching
A	okay
B	alright learning experience of unit learner experience of teaching and they have different questions that they ask so the unit one asks very specific things you know what did you I can show you er which one is this? this this is an LEU alright so that's an LEU okay so it asks very very specific questions like you know erm how did this unit help you? do you did you think it was clear what was required of you within this unit? did you think it erm examined what you wanted it to
A	right?
B	all to do with the unit
A	mm mm
B	er you're not familiar with these?
A	no
B	right
A	I think you only really get to see these erm if you're a student or a convener I guess or?
B	yeah right
A	I wouldn't really have any reason to
B	I don't think I have any LETs with me unfortunately but LETs basically just ask similar sorts of questions except rather than about it being about the unit broadly
A	right
B	it asks very specific things about the teaching so if you're doing lecturing it would ask er what things about this lecture helped you learn what things about this er teacher in your tutorials helped you learn what what things do you think the teacher or lecturer could do more of to assist you in learning erm all that sort of stuff those sorts of questions so they're very very specific around the unit and the actual teaching side of things
A	yeah
B	that is the formal part yes it's very formal and I just happened to have this here so I showed you
A	cool thank you erm so with the informal part what's what would you say those activities involve?
B	the informal part is literally just me at the front and saying look I understand that you guys just filled out this formal part and it's completely anonymous and you know that's great but I find as well that and this is literally the spiel I give them I find as well that you know students tend to be much more open and they think that this is recorded and reflects poorly sometimes on teacher and all that sort of stuff like they kind of miss the mark erm and we're limited as to what we can tell them regarding this so at the end of it it all gets signed and sealed and then they know that this is separate then and I ask them very informally look what did you guys like about? and I I cover the unit or I have covered the unit since I started taking this two O one
A	yeah
B	you know what did you like about the unit? and they'll say I liked this assignment I didn't like this assignment
A	right yeah yeah
B	tell me why that is you know erm
A	okay so do you have to do an evaluation of your tutors as well or informally kind of monitoring?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so even if I'm the boss you know quote unquote
A	yeah yeah
B	then I don't have access to that that is my understanding
A	right
B	okay so in terms of formally I can I can say look I think you guys should do this and I do do that but my understanding is that I have no right to ask them what was the feedback?
A	okay okay loud and clear erm in terms of evaluation activities for curriculum erm designing you know the assignments deciding what content should go into your unit
B	right
A	erm do do you find that you take you know you are doing those kind of activities
B	okay with regard to the unit overall? yeah okay so what sort of evaluations do I do with regards to those?
A	yeah
B	erm pretty simple I do them myself erm I immediately before I do them I look at what's been done previously in the unit and there are some things I like for example with bis two O one there are some things I liked before there were some things I didn't like and I shifted and changed and some things I kept because they'd gone on and I'd taught them for ages erm and then in terms of that er then what generally happens is that the department calls really peer assessment erm so I guess then what I do is er
A	mm mm
B	he is er my official buddy because I'm quite a junior academic here er so I will actually go to
A	yeah
B	okay
A	yeah
B	which is what my subject is in so I was saying look what do you think about this? and he was ah yeah that's fine erm and then I also like that's not that's not necessarily formal but I did give them the actual document and then with a couple of other academics I just asked er just general conversation I would sort of say things at the time like I've actually shifted in that way and they're like oh you need to watch out for this or something which I found quite helpful
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sort of like a peer evaluation
B	very much so
A	yeah
B	and I I I mean I think I don't know if other academics do that to be honest but I know I certainly was heavily involved in that and probably still am just just to make sure I'm on the right track cos sometimes I like to try new things and I know
A	absolutely couldn't agree more
B	with a little bit more experience
A	yeah absolutely that's great thanks
B	erm and I know that and I also know that its been more than one so I know it's a number of them feeling that and so and I ask them you know did you put this in the the form at the end of the semester? they said yes I did and I happened to know that some of the academics here have continued on doing those particular things even though I've had pretty strong student feedback to say that what they were doing didn't work now at the time to be fair I was not full-time employed I was I was not in a position to say anything okay erm anyway getting back on to me er I think evaluation is learning because I do actually er read them quite carefully I have them somewhere in one of these things er I actually have all my LETs er from the last god five years every single one and I can actually see ha ha it's funny cos I actually
A	go on say it
B	I can see it is actually a map erm because when I did it initially I didn't think of it this way which is why I put it there I didn't think of it this way initially but five years ago when I got my first LETs I read them cos it was my first time teaching at all this is just a a tutorial level and I read them and I I actually took on the feedback and it it said a few things and it sort of said you know er I was little bit scary I was a little bit blunt with students basically and I was like okay cool that's fair enough I can understand why they're saying so I changed and then of course the next one came along and those criticisms weren't there anymore but there were some other things as well like you know sometimes you you know went off on a little tangent and stuff like this so I was like okay cool got to take that into account and and so on and so it's been this sort of progressive er like like like a map unfortunately er it's been this progressive thing er and I I can see them quite clearly er in the last five years of just doing them again and again and again and I think er my teaching has benefited massively out of it because if I still taught the way I did when I initially taught and I never got that feedback I I would continue teaching that way and er quite frankly I would not be as good as or that sounds a bit egotistical doesn't it? but I don't feel like I would be as good at teaching as I am today
A	fair enough
B	so that's why that and I I I were even now I put a lot of weight into that
A	yeah great and do you want to make a
B	ah that is quite embarrassing that I used that
A	or you can just still run with the map thing
B	because I hadn't thought about it in terms of a long-term kid of map I was thinking of it as a sort of okay we'll put that away erm
A	no that's fine I mean that's part of the activity is that you can change your mind when you see the other things
B	ah
A	tell me a little bit about that one
B	evaluation as a factory tells to me that it's some sort of production line where you know evaluation goes in results come out and my interpretation of that is that's pretty much where it ends and that that is in complete contrast to this which is the learning side of things I I don't see it as that at all I see it as very much an ongoing process it is er
A	okay that's very interesting
B	okay so erm er yeah okay so we'll go from left to right which is easier for me if that's alright?
A	no that's fine yeah
B	so here I've put on the left-hand side for the transcript er evaluation as a court trial evaluation as an argument it's engineering and it's economics the reason I put that on there is because er previous provision I felt like evaluation was very much erm
A	yeah yeah yeah that's fine
B	that's business
A	yeah yeah
B	oh okay yeah so PDRs and you go in there and have a discussion about all the things you've gotten done and so and and so forth and like that I'm sure most of us if not all of us probably meet roughly that PDR okay on some level but it's all about okay what's happening in the future with regards to that? you know where where is that leading to? erm so in that sense it's kind of like a job interview just without just without the job being present right then and there cos it's about impressions a critique I feel like it's pretty obvious in the sense that they do critique you somehow whether it's good or bad as some sort of critique er evaluation as a risk I put it in there because er any evaluation is a risk should I be going through each and every one of these?
A	yeah that's good that's what you're doing is right yeah
B	right okay so evaluation as a risk just in the sense of you know if you get a bad or if they focus on one particular thing even though it's not necessarily pertinent to your job erm that that's a risk erm you risk you really need to know and I I'll relate this back to these two areas as well where evaluation as a game and evaluation as an art form is that because at the end of the day someone is deciding if you have done a good job a bad job or a neutral job and it's a risk in the sense that if you're very good and you know what's coming and you know how to sell yourself and you know how to promote things or you know the person who's doing the judgement somehow okay then the risk can go down somewhat if you're not very good and there are definitely people like that who are not very good in these situations then the risk goes up and that's an unfortunate consequence of the actual individual as opposed to the process although to be fair you could criticise the process itself because it doesn't tailor to all individuals but anyway erm with regards to a reflection it's a reflection because no matter what you're always thinking about it and my experience has been before any sort of review performance whatever it is er you're always reflecting before it because you get super nervous about what's gonna happen and all that sort of stuff and then you reflect afterwards because they tell you certain stuff and sometimes you think of that wasn't as bad and sometimes you're like well they really seemed to focus on one or two things that I didn't think mattered at all er and it turns out they they were interested in that stuff erm so in that way it's very much a reflection probably more of a reflection than any of erm the other ones in this particular area so that's the both of them now on the far right-hand side which is just for my current profession as an academic right here we have technology map architecture research management statistics learning I'll start with technology the simple reason is we have online er assessment methods er the PDR is online the er units the LEUs and LETs are available online it's all done online and that doesn't necessarily mean I think it works but it is available online erm so evaluation is technology and it you know it spits out a nice number and it gives you a rating I think I've got them in that folder anyway I will show you but it spits out these graphs and diagrams that quite frankly mean absolutely erm but anyway that's the technology component and you know the reason it means sweet FA is because they have these scales but they don't tell you what the scales mean
A	right
B	right so erm
A	that's helpful
B	it is it is
A	yeah
B	so it's a scale of nought
A	it's a guessing game
B	nought to five and you let's say you get four point five but you don't know if everyone else if getting four point five you know they they actually do there's a very brief thing of saying you know good or meets it and all you that you know it's because
A	yeah
B	you need to know er because the students have relative I'm referring to LEUs and LETs here so back to the unit convening stuff er you need and some sort of reference point as to how everyone else is going you know how how if if if everyone else is getting five and you got a four then a four looks really good four out of five that's
A	yeah
B	you know eighty percent
A	yeah
B	you know you look at it that way but actually you have no reference points so that's an issue
A	okay
B	erm now you get that reference point purely subjectively by asking around the department
A	right
B	you ask certain people and you find out that getting a four or above is really good for example
A	okay
B	right
A	yeah
B	er and that's how I know that getting a four is good so I always aim to get a four that's that's my goal er at the very least and I know that getting a low three is you know average to need improvement and getting below a three is bad but there's no there's no there's no real weighting anyway that's the technology side of things that's my little criticism of that evaluation as a map is because erm basically what I was telling you before where I was able to nice and easily map it out all the criticisms that I had in the first bit of teaching and I learnt a lot from those criticisms and you know sort of its got me to where I am today er with regards to architecture er I basically put that in there because I feel like er you know architecture being design and the design of the actual evaluation process has become is very structured here er in my previous profession both as the managing er side of things and in the recruitment side it was an unstructured er messy thing erm so here evaluation as architecture just in the sense that that it has a a very clear structure with a very clear out line very clear directive so on and so forth excuse me and erm so that's the reason for that evaluation as research purely on the basis that I want to know how I'm doing er and it wasn't up to me in previous jobs er in in any of my previous jobs to be honest er evaluation was done to me it wasn't done necessarily for me if you understand the distinction
A	mm mm
B	er so they you know they were adjudicating me in my role but it wasn't necessarily for me to be better it was for them to justify them hiring me or continuing to employ me so evaluation is very much research in this role erm yeah and I must admit I'm perhaps not great for this because I have yet to actually do a PDR because this is my I have yet to complete a full year so I've yet to really comment on on that side of things in great detail but I imagine that going through loosely in the structure of things I imagine would be roughly the same er evaluation of management should yeah we'll put it should really be there actually but er the reason I put management here on the current professions side is purely because it's er the university is so bureaucratic and every level requires you know
A	good yeah that's good you've got a good er attitude towards it then that's that's good that's healthy and so these three that er didn't make er make it for you though we did
B	yeah
A	erm are these three more like those two over there?
B	yes this one particularly
A	where they they they don't resonate with yeah?
B	doesn't resonate with me at all this one doesn't resonate with me at all I have no idea how evaluation is an experiment
A	okay just to clarify then these two here erm
B	yes yes
A	I'm quite interested in er these two in
B	right okay
A	specifically so can you just elaborate a little bit more about
B	sure
A	why you chose those two?
B	er okay so evaluation as a game and evaluation as an art form erm huh there are different it's it's all gonna be very much me I firmly believe that there are very different types of people with regards to career management there are those people who quote unquote play the game er that is they they know those particular areas of their job that are going to give them the most credibility for future promotion er you know I don't want to call them brown nosers or anything but they know those things that pleases their superiors they know those things that doesn't matter okay? they're there playing the game because they're trying to advance their career nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that whatsoever that's fine erm you get the other people who
A	it's kind of like a talent for something
B	absolutely it is a talent but it is it's just not as one talent it's a talent er you you know you need to identify those factors that are most important and then you need to enact upon those factors you know how do you impact upon them? you need to get to know certain individuals you need to be have some sort of er personal
A	yeah well that's cool alright so erm I'm just gonna take a photograph of that with my mobile phone
B	god help us all
A	and then we've got one more ooh we've got no I'll do that right at the end erm
B	yeah
A	which metaphors
B	yeah
A	would you select
B	yeah
A	to represent an approach
B	yeah
A	your approach
B	yeah
A	that you would like to take in the future to evaluate academic literacy in your unit?
B	academic literacy? how would I evaluate academic literacy? what is the approach that I would most like to use?
A	yeah
A	so you'd evaluate their argument
B	no no not their argument I would have to argue with them that they need to change certain things to improve
A	oh I see okay
B	erm and I think that's an unfortunate circumstance they're just so stubborn they've got through high school they've passed high school they've passed their subject and they're like
A	mm okay so we'll take that
B	it's an unfortunate circumstance
A	okay so so this is an approach that you can see yourself taking more and more in the future?
B	er
A	due due to the
B	I would never take it as an approach out I would only take it as an approach out of necessity
A	okay
B	if you see my point right?
A	yeah
B	because you know you can tell students to the till you're blue in the face that you know their writing needs to improve and this is the way they need to improve their writing you know they need to stop using certain words like obviously and you know like the colloquial language and
A	right?
B	okay I understand you've gotten away with this so far but this is what's letting you down now this is you know we shift it to this wonderful thing of employability and they don't seem to understand and you need to sort of sometimes argue with them erm that this matters and this is why it matters and this is how it matters and they don't they don't always get that
A	okay fair enough
B	and that's an incredibly frustrating thing because you have you have genuinely valuable things to tell them
A	that's right
B	and they don't listen
A	yeah absolutely so if you were to take a more ideological approach
B	well yeah that's right that's something that might be a necessity
A	not but that's a fair point that's you being you know saying this is the reality check is that it's more likely to be this but yeah
B	yeah that's right five dollars erm they're very cheap erm they're students after alright? er and I got a I paid her to write me this wonderful email and I was oh that's really nice you know when you get students like that as well very open and
A	yeah that's great that makes it all worthwhile
B	er
A	why is it an issue?
B	er because they need to reflect in a way with regards to well if we're just talking about academic literacy a lot of them reflect in the way that oh this is good enough and that's their reflection they understand that it could be better
A	mm
B	but in terms of the reflection process they're not linking that reflection with future outcomes
A	mm mm
B	so that I mean it I
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	how many of you
A	yeah
B	in it's totality before you handed it in my are you crazy?
A	mm mm
B	like they just sort of write it and that's fine and I just I struggle with that I I well I don't struggle with it I believe it wholeheartedly but I struggle with the fact that they've reached this sort of conclusion where that's almost acceptable how can they reflect upon their academic literacy if they're not even willing to read their own work at the end of it?
A	mm true
B	erm so ideologically I love that as an idea erm
A	yeah okay
B	it's just it's just the the clearest thing for me cos I think that feedback we give students
A	mm
B	that's essentially what it is I kind of refer to this as a shit sandwich I'm sure you've heard that term before right?
A	no
B	okay compliment criticism compliment
A	oh oh right yeah okay
B	shit sandwich right?
A	I always call it a burger it's cool
B	right oh shit burger right okay cool yeah yeah er so
A	eat it late at night after the fun
B	yeah yeah that's right so with regards to evaluation as learning I would ideologically I'd like them to understand that they have something to learn from the things we write on their sheets of paper I spend a lot of time going through their assignments there's none here that I've actually marked which is very disappointing but you can see I I've gone to a lot of effort and I again I mean we've you've been involved in meetings and some of the academics almost brag about how quickly they go through these assignments and it's like ah you know you spend more than ten minutes on any assignment are you crazy? blah blah blah
A	three minutes yeah
B	yeah and this is like tick tick tick mark bang
A	yeah
B	and I hate that I cos as a student I read the feedback you know and I I looked at it and I did all some of these big key words you know you you can reflected on it and I looked at it and I saw it as a map and all that sort of stuff and it was you know a design to get me to the next stage and these academics who just tick and we used to hate it the students there was a there was a group of us er myself and my friends and this is probably where the my biggest advantage lies I believe is because I'm
A	absolutely
B	now it's been since I was in a classroom it has been god six or seven years alright but still it's roughly the same sort of context and a hell of a lot more closer than their the content they're referring to and er myself and my group of friends we all hated the ticking absolutely hated it it's like okay it's great I've got my credit
A	yeah but what does it mean? yeah
B	which would be a disappointing mark right? and and it's like I I don't I don't know why this is an you've you've written like a paragraph at the end saying you've done this well you've done this well but you haven't told me how I've done it well you haven't told me anything like this and I I personally hated that and erm so anyway these these academics this is my little thing don't tell anyone else this
A	do you want me to press the stop button?
B	some of these yeah
