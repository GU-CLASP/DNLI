D	yeah that's the thing
A	yeah
C	yeah

C	yeah you could have got back a bit earlier
A	how long were we?
D	not as long as us
A	no
D	er I don't know about forty-fives minutes I think
B	so you had two pints didn't you?
D	what?
B	yes you did
D	but the man at the bar was so accommodating
B	was he?
C	yeah
B	well
D	probably I don't know
B	oh
C	so you said that the ownership's changed
B	mm
A	and she's gone now?
B	yeah she's gone
C	remember last time we went there was that really surreal conversation about what was it? The injections it was having or something?
C	yeah
D	that was that woman wasn't it
C	yeah that was that woman
A	last time we were
B	mm
A	we spoke to that
B	oh yeah
A	the last time we were here it was from revolution
B	mm
B	because he didn't know how to write
D	it's slightly burnt
B	you two got the alright ones
A	yeah
B	I was telling
A	where were you?
D	at home
B	oh we were so hungry because we had quite a bit of wine and then you feel really tipsy because you haven't had anything to eat
D	yeah but that's are own fault isn't it
B	but your brother is very much
A	I would like to meet your family
D	he is very funny
B	he is very funny
A	I want to meet them
B	at our wedding
A	oh yeah
C	so when is your birthday?
A	I'm not sure if we can make that one
B	yeah
A	maybe we'll have wait and play it by ear
D	some time in the future
A	I'd like to
B	mm
A	are they coming here for before his birthday
B	I think so I don't know
D	no
A	are you having a little party?
D	hopefully yeah
B	well if the weather's nice I'd quite like to go to erm there's a what would you call it? A woodland park area? What was it? A it's not a National Trust area but it's a wildlife area I guess
A	okay
B	but erm they've got barbecues set up in little
C	mm
B	so you could just take your barbecue stuff and just cook your own barbecues
A	mm that's nice
B	but you had a team party there didn't you?
D	mm
B	I don't know
A	Don't know so you could have really well
D	well last year it was boiling wasn't it but I think it would be a bit
B	easter's always nice
C	yeah it usually isn't it?
A	mm
B	Jesus makes sure
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	what was it we were listening on the radio on the way down here? They were talking about erm vicars and what was it?
A	oh
B	ah
A	for all of the choir people
C	yeah  for the  for the choir
A	anybody who's in the choir needs a CRB check
D	what?
A	mm
C	and then there was all these that were phoning in saying well yeah our choir's been disbanded because the the vicar didn't want a CRB check and all this kind of stuff
B	oh my God
D	it's not the choir you need to worry about
C	yeah
B	it's like how far do you take it?
A	it's extremes yeah
B	how sad
A	because there's too much paper work involved rather than people just going in enjoying singing together
C	yeah
B	but I bet community choirs and stuff don't have to do that because it's just people just turn up don't they?
A	yeah I suppose
B	were you listening to Jeremy Vine?
A	it would be a bit much if they
C	erm
A	what channel's he on?
B	radio two
C	radio two
B	lunchtime
A	yeah
D	that sounds like a very Jeremy Vine thing to talk about
C	yeah
A	mm mm
C	yeah the other day I was listening to it and they had the oh I won't repeat it now
A	why?
C	it was the anti circumcision league
C	it was quite funny
B	I used to love listening to Jeremy Vine but now they get such extremes phoning up that you just think they're just having a big row now
A	mm
C	mm
B	mm
A	what's this new? There's a new trend with female circumcision
D	I know
D	well it's very big in Egypt isn't it anyway apparently
A	is it?
D	yeah apparently
A	I didn't know that
C	there's a lot more impact on their their organs than the male though
D	well they say because it's illegal now in Egypt they were saying how
A	really
C	yeah
B	because it's dodgy
A	oh that's not good
D	I think it said something like seventy percent of all Egyptian woman have had it done
C	really
A	I never even knew that
D	because you're not allowed any pleasure
D	that's what  That's what  it's for
A	is it?
D	yeah it's to stop the craving of it or the thought about it
A	really? I
C	yeah it makes it extremely painful
D	I think in Nigeria and places like that they do a lot of it as well
C	mm
B	how horrendous
C	mm
A	but they said the trend is coming to England quite a lot
B	really?
D	well I'd imagine that's probably from the African communities
C	yeah
A	mm
B	hmm
A	that
C	that was fantastic
D	thank you very much
B	you put them in at seven o'clock
C	no
D	half past nine
C	you could really taste the cider in that
D	yeah it was nice wasn't it
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	A lovely sauce
C	it was very nice
B	see we'd love to cook
A	no
C	yeah but she was drinking your sloe gin the other day
B	was she?
A	oh yes she did
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	I think dad might have polished that off
C	oh right
B	oh did you like it?
A	but oh it was lovely
B	we've got some more
C	that was well nice
A	mm
C	yeah in that little bottle with the the cork
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but we had our we were making lots of Christmas presents and one of the Christmas presents was erm onion chutney or onion sweet onion relish
D	yeah
B	that's what we'd been making just before
A	yeah it's lovely
B	yeah that's lovely but then if you clean it but it smells of onions and then you make onion er onion vodka basically
B	onion fruit vodka
A	huh
D	mm
B	it just
A	sounds lovely
C	onion fruit vodka?
B	well because the pan just had so
A	yeah well because used the same
D	yeah
B	but you know sometimes you if you make a curry in a pan you can even though you've washed it you can still a bit of curry
A	yeah
B	well it obviously had a bit of onion still lingering so now we've got onion fruit vodka
D	four bottles of onion fruit
B	two
A	and does it? It turns liqueury?
D	yeah that's the whole point of it yeah
B	yeah
D	well you can try some later
A	then I went to the shop and realised how expensive vodka is nowadays
B	yeah
A	I thought it was really cheap stuff
C	really? How much?
A	yeah well I don't know
B	twenty quid a bottle
C	twenty?
B	well we bought a massive one
D	no
A	yeah but I thought it was
B	Stingy
A	yeah I think I am
B	because you could make quite a lot with that probably so in the end it's actually quite
D	Cos it triples in strength doesn't it if you put sugar in it and leave it
C	does it?
A	mm
D	mm
B	moonshine and stuff
C	fisherman's Friends
D	and that
B	so you just
C	is it really?
D	if you put
A	menthol
B	yeah and it just blows your head off
C	yeah?
D	but yeah leave it so it becomes like a liqueur or whatever but he said that's the big drink over there
C	wow
D	I just thought Fisherman's Friends that's like disgusting but
A	well I don't know it's like I quite like a menthol drink
D	yeah maybe it might be quite nice
C	yeah
A	how long do you have to leave it for?
D	I think sort of two or three months
B	it's like a sambucary type
A	Cos you have to put sugar?
D	I think yeah
C	hmm
B	the trouble is you just don't know how strong it is so it could be really strong
C	it could blind you
B	yeah cos that's what they say about moonshine isn't it? Cos I remember my friend at university made some moonshine and I told dad and he said you could go blind
A	moonshine
C	I remember
B	I don't know how you make moonshine but it's with vodka and
C	I don't know
B	potatoes?
D	well no it's not like vodka it is the potato isn't it?
B	it's potato
D	well it doesn't have to be potato
B	yeah you could make
A	mm
D	well I remember your mum and dad saying about how they used to get the marrow
B	oh yeah
D	and they'd
B	no I don't think they poured anything in it and they just leave it that it drips through the bottom because it ferments
D	oh yeah that's it it was just like yeah
C	your mum and dad used to do that?
B	into a demijohn or something
C	wow
A	from a marrow?
B	yeah
D	I think I would personally choose something nicer than a marrow but
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	well you can do it with any any fruit can you?
D	yeah
A	mm
B	anything that could ferment I guess
C	mm
B	let's do it
D	well we'll try some onion fruit vodka in a bit
A	mm
D	and we'll see what you think about it
B	I know I shouldn't have said it because now you're going to think it taste of it
A	well
C	yeah
A	you eat onions raw and cooked
B	yeah but onions and fruit
C	I don't know
D	yeah onion onions and strawberries
C	oh okay
D	it's not a classic mix is it?
B	oh I don't know
D	yeah that's true
A	oh he put strawberries in
C	hmm
B	was all wrong
A	yeah
D	she was the
A	mm
B	and that mango dessert
A	mm
B	what is our dessert?
D	well
B	no but it's five to ten now
D	right well okay
B	oh it would have been amazing
D	A lemon surprise
B	that it's not
B	it's a raw lemon on a plate
A	yeah
C	we are  We are  men
B	well don't be sexist
A	yes
B	because we deserve it more because we've worked harder
A	I'm not going to comment because I'll get in trouble
B	Don't be
C	Good
B	Don't be beaten down by him just because you're married now
A	yeah but when I think about it
B	yeah you don't have
A	next week I might say I I worked harder
C	well done
B	well done
A	but I did
B	you won't get a beating
D	you've been living with
A	drive
B	yeah you drive
C	but I did navigate
A	yes yeah but it wasn't as hard as driving
C	no it wasn't
A	driving is harder
B	did you have a sat nav?
C	er yeah but
B	I did navigate
D	driving is actually
B	it was tiring
D	it is
A	yeah
D	especially on motorways
A	especially me because I'm like this
B	I think you're really brave
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and then if it was me driving with just
A	you need someone in the back to occupy her
C	is she good at travelling?
D	she's not too bad actually is she?
B	no she's not that
C	she doesn't puke up or anything?
B	not anymore
D	not since the dreaded puking up days
B	oh every trip
C	yeah I remember that one
D	and she shat herself didn't she?
B	oh yeah
C	oh
B	oh every journey would be a stress because you'd just be thinking what's that noise? Ugh she's being sick
A	oh
D	we had to take a towel with us everywhere didn't we?
B	yeah
A	just with the travelling? But she's alright now?
B	yeah she's alright now
D	yeah
B	we kind of worked out that perhaps it was because we were giving her a bottle of milk so that she would go to sleep because she was still of the age where she'd she'd have to have milk all the time
D	yeah
C	no
B	makes cheese
B	makes cheese vomit
C	some kids just don't grow out of that anyway do they
B	no
C	they're they're sick forever
B	well luckily she's got
A	oh
B	yeah
A	big country house place and little
D	oh
A	it's not even like a normal sickness it's just like completely whoosh

C	well done
B	I was like where are we going?
A	I know
B	yeah
C	what? They're still not going now?

D	I think it was a Bentley Continental
B	yeah
D	A Lamborghini Morado and an Aston Martin
B	I don't know
C	did you get in the video?
B	no because they had all of the crew all of the way round and a red carpet and these woman all looking
C	was she wearing a bikini?
B	no she wasn't she looked all French I would say
D	yeah
B	yeah she looked quite stylish

A	she probably just
C	was the room nice?
B	yeah it was lovely

B	no they've been kicked out now
D	no they got moved out a couple of days later
A	they got kicked out
B	but walking around that
C	yeah

C	yeah it was just a mish mash of a load of stuff
A	oh I thought they were supposed to be the erm what do you call them?
B	it was all about erm the corporate what was it? Erm
C	well
D	capitalism and corporate
B	ninety-nine percent and all that stuff yeah
A	yeah it was supposed to be about the bankers and stuff isn't it
B	yeah
C	well it's not though is it
B	no
A	people have their own ideas and just decide to protest
B	yeah and it's just people joining along

B	yeah
C	they've actually been given a little pitch in the er market
B	oh really
C	they were you know outside Topshop and Next?
B	yeah yeah

B	big square
C	in Edinburgh they had loads of tents as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but they got told
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	but like you said er the problem is the the there was no clear message
B	no
C	it was just like a bunch of kids
B	mm
C	complaining about
B	and the thing was
C	mm
A	and that's why they camped there
B	so don't go and use those facilities
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	but we didn't see any of that did we? We saw loads of people really smoking weed and erm and braiding hair and stuff
D	playing playing a piano
B	oh yeah playing the piano
A	where did they get the piano?
D	yeah I don't know
B	yeah
C	yeah

D	no not at all they all seemed
A	no
C	no
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah they weren't like that at all
B	to try and understand what they were actually campaigning about
D	but there was a man in the I can't think what it is
C	yeah
D	V for Vendatta mask
C	yeah anonymous masks
B	oh yeah yeah loads of them in masks
C	I know
A	they're doing that in Belgium as well
C	well all over
A	yeah he was talking on the internet
B	yeah
C	like they were in their tents and I was speaking to them
B	oh really
C	and I was trying to get them to to realise that they needed some like a clear message to unite and not not so much a demand but a like focus on one thing
B	clear message
C	and they
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	just buying into
A	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	they were anti chrony capitalist protestors which is something completely different but they didn't make that clear
B	yeah
C	yeah just need some leadership really
B	yeah

D	it was in a big power station but it wasn't Battersea
B	oh
D	well it was free wasn't it so
B	yeah but I liked seeing all of the pictures that I looked at when I was doing A Level art
C	yeah
B	I thought lots of it was great but
C	yeah
A	well especially well if you studied quite a lot of it you know the background to a lot of the pictures
B	yeah you're like oh god that's the picture that I put in my scrapbook
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and they depict a certain era of like a political or or whatever kind of struggle going on at that time
B	yeah
C	and that you really know it though to
B	yeah to appreciate why why they've done it
A	mm
C	that's why I I don't get art
D	no I'm not an art
B	no
C	yeah
C	I remember some of them in the National Gallery though
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah really red
B	and you just think
D	yeah I think I prefer
B	classics
C	yeah
D	and then we went to the best bit didn't we then
B	I don't if we told you about the best bit
C	what was the best bit?
B	I would like some more booze right now
D	well what sort of booze? Do you want  Do you want  onion vodka or?
B	what would you like?
A	I don't mind
D	let's try it
B	can you get
C	erm it's on the shelf in the kitchen
B	yeah the best was we were walking around London for ages and you know you get a bit like oh we saw the erm the boat
C	Cutty Sark? No
B	so we saw that and we were walking around
C	that looks dangerous
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	in a gin bottle
B	yeah you know you've got to use bottles don't you
A	just a little
B	it does look syrupy? Erm and we went to Vinopolis which is erm a place that Laithwaites have a shop and it's a massive tasting area of wines and stuff so we went there cos we thought we better had do go to where there's a shop for Laithwaites and do my homework
C	mm
B	erm went walked around around Borough Market for ages and then we were like right okay
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but we were walking down this other bit erm and it
C	mm
B	so we queued up and this woman came out with blood all over her face
A	oh yeah
B	so we went to the tombs of London
A	ah okay
B	ah god it was amazing
C	yeah
B	so you walked in and she went right I'll tell you all about this
B	and we followed her and we went into another bit where there was a man hacking
A	yeah
B	and then the very end bit they were like right this is the proper tombs
B	and blow in your face and they were covered in blood and there was a man with a chainsaw
A	mm
B	but it was really good wasn't it? It was so much fun
D	I loved it
A	yeah that sounds brilliant
C	it does sound good
B	but
D	I did  I did  feel really vulnerable I must say being on the end
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	it was really good
A	that would freak me out
B	it was really really scary
D	but yeah and then there was like you know you went through this bit and there was all limbs that had been chopped up and everything
B	just swinging around and going up to you and going
A	mm
D	and they had the noise playing didn't they obviously so there obviously wasn't a chainsaw was there
B	yeah
D	it was brilliant
C	that sounds good
A	brilliant yeah
B	oh
D	but the bit before it where it wasn't the scary bit was really funny as well wasn't it
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah
B	and there was this little girl
B	and what happens is you're walking along and then
D	yeah they send you in one at a time or two at well in parts
B	yeah and you have to wait until the other people have gone
D	so you just hear screams basically
B	and she goes it's your turn next
A	mm
B	it was so funny wasn't it?
C	that sounds great
B	have you heard of it then?
A	did you scream? No no not that one no
C	no
B	I screamed loads it was so funny
C	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	the day after the wedding we went on the ghost tour
B	oh did you?
C	we went  We went  underground into the you know the the old tunnels and stuff
B	yeah
C	but there was this guide
B	oh great
C	you know in that
B	yeah
A	yeah like that
C	one of them kind of cloaks
B	yeah yeah it's
C	like a red cloak
B	mm
C	because that was like big in Edinburgh
D	burk and Hare or whatever they were called
B	ah
C	yeah that's it and then you go underground into all these tombs and then
A	mm cos the underground network in is massive
C	it's massive
B	oh is it?
C	yeah
D	it is like a big city isn't it
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah they used live
C	and it was quite weird because you would be down there and it would be like all dripping and
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	so you you could hear all this like
B	really?
C	but it was quite weird
C	yeah
A	and then there was all these weird witchy rooms with the circle and she
C	yeah
B	otherwise you'll disappear
A	I wouldn't dare
C	yeah I was the same I was like
B	yeah yeah sometimes you just want you don't want to tempt fate do you
A	and when yeah
C	yeah and then someone ran past and and screamed you know to make
A	mm
C	but it had that one
B	yeah
A	it wasn't like your one
B	oh it was
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	I think
A	mm
D	Cos at the start when we actually paid for it we
B	we'd gone through the back entrance so we didn't even se the build up outside
D	no that's right yeah
A	mm
B	outside the other side they were like going come over here come on
D	yeah and we went into this room and it was as we paid the money
B	about the history of the underground
D	and it was like oh no
B	and it was oh god we can't get out of this now I've paid twenty-five quid each for that
B	so I've got to go and sit through some history lesson
D	I
C	maybe
A	maybe yeah yeah
C	that's quite clever then yeah
A	yeah
B	because it was like the shitiest video you have ever seen and you're like oh god they've really spent like zero pence
D	yeah and it was only ten people
B	yeah
A	thank you
C	that sounds awesome that does
A	it does sound really good
D	it was  It was  one of the funniest things I've ever been on I must say
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	you know but we almost didn't do that didn't we because we were just like oh twenty-five pounds
C	I think they are great things like that
B	but we were like come on you're in London
C	yeah yeah
B	so I'm glad we did it
C	yeah but one of the best things about London is there is lots of free stuff to do as well
A	lots of
D	yeah that's it
B	yeah yeah so you could balance it out
A	yeah
D	and things like Natural History Museum and the Science Museum are just incredible
A	yeah
B	I know we hadn't probably
D	it's like some of the best the best attractions in Britain really I think
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh god and then in the evening we were like right okay lets go to Leicester Square
D	oh it's horrendous
B	you just can't believe that amount of people there
D	just crazy
B	Cos last time we went to a show we just went straight there
A	where?
C	yeah
A	really?
C	yeah it's horrible
D	well we went right at the peak time didn't we before all the
A	I didn't have that when I was
B	yeah just before the shows started
C	yeah yeah I've been there that time as well
D	I just hate things like that
B	oh it's horrendous isn't it? You just
C	no
A	mm
C	and it's weird as well cos most people aren't speaking English as well and  you could be  you could be anywhere couldn't you
B	no
D	yeah
B	you don't feel like you're in London
A	you could be anywhere in the world
C	no it's weird it's so
B	yeah
A	what was that?
B	make me
C	mm
B	and we went there last time and we had a real laugh there
C	is that the one in?
B	it's at the back of
A	yeah yeah we went in there
C	is that the one we went to?
A	yeah I think so
B	it's the proper one one with the the laughy face and you go down some steps
A	you go down the stairs
C	no went downstairs
D	yeah that's it
A	is that where we went? Yeah we went
B	it was a proper comedy store

C	he was on Never Mind  he was on Never Mind  the Buzzcocks or something
A	and we hated him
B	oh was he?

B	oh no
A	I think some people eve booed him because he was doing this weird stuff and we were all like
C	what was his name?
A	there was so
B	yeah
C	and he was useless
B	because he was new
A	but but he's got his own style so now he's on TV a lot

A	oh we'll have a look for him
C	oh I'll find out yeah but he he's not funny though
B	oh
C	it was  It was  quite
B	you just feel
C	it was like oh my god
D	well there was one of
B	yeah
A	I think  I think  he takes his jokes along for a long time
B	yeah too drawn out
D	there was one man in that place he just a complete death and it is almost embarrassing
B	oh god
C	it's horrible isn't it
A	mm
D	he was only on
B	yeah he
C	yeah
D	he was probably on for about four minutes probably and then just
B	yeah it's you just feel so awkward don't you?
C	yeah
D	you know when they say like they die you know
C	yeah
B	just like stuttering and just like  and then  and then they try and go on to another subject because they know that last subject hasn't worked and then
C	yeah
A	oh
C	and once that's got in you once it's set you it just gets worse doesn't it?
B	it's just too late
D	yeah
B	oh I just felt
A	but the other acts were good
C	it's a tough job isn't it? Jesus
B	oh yeah well we didn't go to the Comedy Store because we turned up and the doorman was like this
C	maybe he was part of it
B	oh I don't know but I just thought right this is isn't as fun as last time we came

D	yeah
C	you can't go wrong really can you?
D	no
A	yeah
D	something
C	even it's loads of people dying on stage
B	oh god
D	yeah
B	oh but the funniest thing about that whole night was they had this big fat American man
D	yeah it was just like oh it was brilliant for the person who was on stage because he was obviously really sharp
B	yeah properly put down and he was going
B	and then the man was going this pen means I'm going to be the next president of the U S of A and everyone was like boo
D	but he was there on his own as well wasn't he
B	yeah yeah because he got up and then everyone
B	it was so funny wasn't it

B	onion?
C	I'll just have a sip
A	erm I'm not sure myself
D	drink it
B	such a waste of vodka isn't it?
D	well it is because we have bloody bottles of the stuff

B	onions
A	there is  There is  that touch isn't there? You can taste it
D	it is it's the
B	it's such a shame
