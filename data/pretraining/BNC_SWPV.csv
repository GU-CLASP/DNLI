C	you wouldn't do it eh? mm
B	it was only a baby one if it had been a big bird I couldn't have done it

C	blackbird
B	oh yes it yeah

A	staggering and flapping yeah
C	you know on the verge and it was flapping its wings and it sort of and we were stopped there weren't we for traffic and
B	yes
C	it was right there and you know it was really
A	he's sort of orange on his front like a coral sort of orange
B	oh right yeah
C	mm
A	he's got a bit of a greyish patch on one wing and the rest is black
C	oh
A	with a bit of white I think
B	mm hm

C	mm
B	oh
C	it's bullfinches
B	yeah
C	and it'll be no doubt being so colourful as that
A	that must be the boy
C	a male
A	yeah I'd imagine
C	mm
A	he seems to be there about the same time when I come down in the morning putting the kettle on look out of the window he's there
C	yes
B	mm
A	seems to have a routine
C	yeah he'll have a a route
A	mm
C	mm mm
B	well we have a robin don't we? and he always sits on the same part of the fence
A	branch yeah that's his spot
C	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah that that's his perch really
B	yes
D	mm
B	yes
C	is he?
A	yeah that's about the same time late afternoon I think when it's got warm
C	yeah yeah the
D	mm
A	it's gone into the stones and he just lies himself out full length
C	yeah
A	with his front paws out and his back paws stretched out really relaxed
C	that's it
A	they really
C	you can't look at
A	yeah
C	ah and he's got a fur coat on hasn't he?
A	I know as well yeah
A	but he just looks all sort of loose
B	mm
A	and relaxed and you know like you'd just pick him up and all his bones would just slip to the bottom he just looks really fluid
B	mm yeah
C	well that that's another thing really with er cats and and er furry things er rabbits in particular that's how they get picked up
A	mm
C	you know the the skin and the fur is like loose
A	yes yes
C	it is like a coat on
A	yes
C	and you grab it and really
A	and all the rest slips to the bottom doesn't it?
C	yeah
B	the weight goes to the bottom
C	and that's how the mother
A	yes carries the baby kitten yeah
C	say yeah yeah say erm a tiger
A	mm
C	moving her kittens like
A	mm
C	and get them like that in her teeth and carry them to the new spot and come back and get the next one and put one there
A	yes
C	oh yes
B	oh right
A	and he wanted to have a go
C	oh right
A	sitting on the stones
C	mm
A	and they were just looking at each other nose to nose touching
B	oh were they?
C	were they?
A	like that
C	mm
A	for ages and it was who blinks first is out
A	and they were there for minutes
C	mm
A	and neither would look away
B	oh
C	was it the same type of cat like or
A	one was black and one was striped
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and and did they move in the end?
C	a tabby
A	eventually the striped cat went and laid back down
B	oh
A	and the black cat was sitting up all the time
B	oh
C	mm
B	they didn't get it
A	no
C	he could he could have laid down though couldn't he?
A	he could have laid down but it was still
C	mm
B	mm
D	that striped cat is very relaxed all the way round but
C	well obviously that's his territory isn't it? that that's his route
A	yes
D	no it's very it's quite shy
B	oh
C	mm
A	if we go up to him he scarpers straight away
C	was it nervous?
A	I can't get near enough I can't touch him
C	mm mm he'll
B	yeah
C	he'll live a long while then
A	yeah
C	because this timidity in particularly in birds
A	mm
C	in fact
A	twitching around yes
C	yeah and they'll move mm
A	yeah
C	because it's
A	yes
C	cos they're so well camouflaged and so the best thing to do
B	we had a lovely black cat that came
C	mm
B	and he used to stand at the back door if the door was closed
C	talk to us
B	and it would meow at meow meow meow until you opened the door
C	to come in
B	and then he's come in and he'd walk all round the house
A	yes
C	yeah he'd have a look round
B	and erm
A	seems alright
B	at one time I was writing at the table and he jumped on to the table to me
A	oh god
C	and then he got sat on the window ledge looking out
B	yes he did yeah
A	he was sat up like you say looking out mm
B	yeah mm
A	and doesn't he come now?
B	no he hasn't been for about a month now
C	no
A	oh right
B	so we don't know whether he's got knocked over or
C	something's happened
A	no
B	whether he's moved I don't know but I haven't seen him
A	yeah
C	but erm I used to sometimes see when I looked out at maybe six o'clock on a morning

B	you know I mean you can have a big yeah
D	well you have
B	bag of it and it its goes down
D	yes

A	yeah I should be very strong
D	but it it is nutritious
B	pardon?
A	I should be very strong
B	yes well you look it really

A	mm
B	I didn't like it though
A	no you wouldn't
B	mm
A	yeah I didn't like it the first time we had it but
B	no
A	I think you're supposed to have things about eleven times
B	is that right?
A	to see whether you actually can
B	oh right
A	get used to it
B	I knew when I was small I used to absolutely hate cabbage
A	mm
B	hated it
A	it's not a pleasant texture really is it?
B	no
A	yes yeah
B	I don't like it too crunchy
D	I thought spinach was quite a traditional thing to grow in a zone allotment and that's
A	mm
B	mm yes
D	there's a there were initially but I think I've managed to remove them
B	oh have you?
D	yes
B	oh right have you put something round the
D	well they managed to get through the that tent
B	yes
D	yes so I've tried to put it down a bit more securely
B	oh right
A	no we haven't put pellet's down because we don't want it if we're going to eat it
B	no
D	it's an organic garden with organic compost and organic seeds
B	oh yeah well
A	that is the problem
B	anyway show me it
A	yes
B	no
A	it's surprising how little water they actually take

B	mm
A	gosh if anybody said that to me
B	mm
A	I wouldn't like that would you?
B	mm
A	I don't think I'd get mistaken for being a good laugh
B	I remember once at work when I was at
A	oh right
B	I said oh
A	oh that's good
B	right but I've never been bothered whether people like me or not if they like me
A	mm
B	if they don't well tough
A	tough
B	there's plenty of people I don't like
B	I'm I'm not one for currying favour with anybody
A	no
B	I can't be bothered
A	no I can't
B	I don't think it's worth it if they like you
A	that's up to them isn't it?
B	mm
A	mm
B	to keep
A	yeah
B	then not
A	go out of your way too much
B	no no afraid not
A	mm
B	is
A	I hope
B	oh no it's Saturday isn't it? I keep thinking it's Friday I don't know why
A	well it does keep changing that's the thing
B	it does every day
A	you've got to stick with it
B	oh right
A	if he goes to his mum's it's about six if he doesn't it's about three
B	oh right
A	mm
B	mm
A	whereas you did used to get you know quite a good deep amount
C	mm
A	but after so long those disappeared and they got some new soup dishes that were smaller
C	oh is it?
D	yeah
C	well it would be something like that then that's been it
A	mm
D	what's the soup of the day?
B	now do you want to
A	asparagus
B	do you want to taste this?
C	come on then?

B	mm want some?
C	go on then
A	yeah? do you want some
D	yes
A	yes oh right
C	I've had a look at that
A	sorry yes
C	hey
C	eh?
A	you're right it's too hard
C	yeah definitely for me
C	I wasn't very good at algebra anyway
B	is it too hard for you
D	no
B	it's not too hard for
B	I know
C	he is a hundred times cleverer than what I am
D	to be honest if that came up in the exam I'd be quite happy
B	oh would you?
B	oh right
D	mm
B	so how will it be different this next term then
D	erm well I suppose the modules becoming more specialised to accounting finance and management
B	oh yeah
D	erm so
B	mm
D	so it's it's more numerical
B	mm right
A	yeah yeah
D	that's a good thing in my opinion
B	yes yes
C	but you're obviously sort of
D	yes
C	mm entirely different from your early years isn't it?
D	yeah
C	you know you're coming into like the real world now you you can sort of see
D	yes
C	mm
D	mm
C	you know as you go through life you might think I'll I'll take a course in that and either add something to it or you can have a change of of direction completely because you've got enough up there to be able to
B	mm they're pretty aren't they?
C	mm hey
B	mm
C	this is posh is this
A	mm
C	it shows
A	nice aren't they?
B	pretty aren't they? yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah it's funny I was only only
A	yeah I have
B	and I I don't I use mine special
A	no
D	I suppose your china is like a best set
A	the best yeah well that's the old-fashioned way isn't it?
B	mm
D	yes
B	yes
A	but I had er
B	mm
A	and then I added to it and I saw these in Bins one time
B	mm
A	and I started getting two
B	yes
A	now it's
B	and do you know there isn't a china department in Bins now
A	no you wouldn't be able to do that now would you?
B	and the this is what I was saying to dad If you wanted a china tea set now
A	mm
B	you'd have to order it wouldn't you?
A	yeah
B	mm
D	in
B	oh yes yes
D	but I'm a little bit worried about it because erm they're applying for planning permission to split the shop so
A	oh yeah they have haven't they?
D	I'm not sure what's happening there exactly
B	into what like
A	don't know that's what we don't know
B	no no
A	whether they're only going to have half of it or?
B	mm
C	that's what happened with Laura Ashley's though wasn't it?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and now it's gone
C	mm that's the result isn't it?
A	or whether they're going to have half for the china shop and half for a tea shop
D	yes
A	mm
D	cos one of them is change of use to a restaurant
A	yeah
B	oh right yeah
A	tea shop gosh
D	I think what's amazing is how well they've lasted
A	yeah they have lasted a long time they have got a tea shop now
B	have they?
A	but it's on the next floor
B	oh is it?
A	but I won't go up
B	mm
A	you know cos it's such an old building
B	mm
A	I feel panicked in there the ceiling's too low
B	mm
A	the staircase is really
D	narrow
B	narrow
A	caged in
B	mm
A	and it starts making me get in a flap it's too small
B	mm
A	it's difficult to get the space just right you know
B	you need a lot don't you?
B	you need a lot of space
D	I think it's a shame that most of the china nowadays isn't made in
B	oh
D	it's home in Stoke-on-Trent
A	yeah
C	very nice that
A	asparagus soup
C	asparagus
A	mm
D	of course it's the very short English asparagus season at the moment
C	oh yes asparagus right I've got it now I've got it pictured
D	yes
C	it's like a green shoot isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and it has a top on and
D	yes
C	and whatever thank you
D	and it's really nice when it comes into season the asparagus
B	mm mm
D	that's
B	never
D	it's
B	no I know it isn't no I know it isn't
D	er
C	have you grown it?
D	it's very hard to grow I haven't grown it now it takes two or three years before you can actually pick it
C	mm
B	oh right
D	but there is a erm a big asparagus farm in
C	right
D	yes
C	that's it
B	mm
D	it's supposed to be a very good vegetable in terms of nutrients
B	is it?
D	yes
B	mm
C	mm
D	I think it's nice to get the seasonal vegetables I think when something's in season there's there's a world of difference between
B	absolutely
D	a fruit from somewhere in the world that is sort of not really it's proper place I mean a classic example is strawberries
B	they're neither sweet nor soft
D	no
B	they're
C	you see when we were younger
B	well
C	and we were brought up on seasons but you know I mean just for example to have a salad like lettuce at Christmas
D	yes
B	mm
C	wow that was something
B	well no you could you couldn't get it could you?
C	no
B	it was like erm tomatoes
C	mm
B	and then they just used to come out didn't they?
C	mm
B	you used to buy about two at a time
B	didn't you?
C	mm
D	but what is amazing is we had bought English apples from
B	mm
D	it just shows you can nearly do the year
C	mm
B	mm
D	just
B	which I find mind you I know you eat a lot of fruit and we we don't eat so much but I find
D	yeah
B	mm
C	that's because they've been stored
B	and I think it's the way they're stored
C	in like some
D	mm
C	very controlled
B	chilled
C	and actually
B	mm
C	is what I'm getting at and they've been sort of er er
D	I think sometimes
C	animated condition like that
D	they get the the temperature just a bit too low
B	mm mm
D	and when we cut it it wasn't very good
C	no
B	no
C	inside they're soft it's as though the the sort of er once upon and time the fruit would start to get go bad from the outside outside in
D	mm
C	mm
B	mm nice
C	well I suppose in a way that's about the the er the fruit I eat
B	you like pears better than
C	mm
B	mm
C	I'll have er an orange er
B	excuse me
D	well they have distinct seasons oranges
C	yes
D	yes
C	but I was going to say that's because
D	yeah
C	easy to peel I don't mind oranges but I hate peeling them I really do and then when you've gone to all that trouble of peeling them
D	often it's the ugliest oranges that are the nicest
C	it's what?
D	the ugliest oranges the ones that are green and have got grey marks
C	yeah re they?
B	mm
C	yeah
B	and they were sort of erm peculiar shape and they had all bulges round they weren't smooth at all
C	mm hm
B	but they were you could eat them
D	the lemons?
B	no yes lemons you could eat them like an orange
B	yeah
D	yeah that's
B	you know they weren't bitter or anything
D	mm
B	but they were ugly you know they were really like erm all bumps round them weren't they? all rough skin
C	yes
D	mm
C	they they didn't look very appetising did they?
B	no they didn't no
D	no but Greek oranges are a bit like that
C	as you say yeah
B	mm
C	those er that look the
B	very nice
A	oh good
C	ugliest sort of thing are very often sweetest
D	mm

B	no
B	we've got a new fish and chip shop

C	mm
D	I think they will probably do that
A	maybe
D	yes
B	mm
C	but what do they do?
B	have a champagne tea afternoon tea
C	oh yeah
A	that's what I'm going to have the day
C	mm hm
B	oh right at

C	at er
A	excuse
B	excuse me yes sitting out on there
B	nice
A	and what time of day was that?
B	oh that was about three o'clock
A	oh really it's when the weakness starts setting in you know?
A	mm
B	we were going to have coffee and then we changed our minds didn't we?
C	mm
D	to tea?
B	no to martini
D	oh martini oh right
D	mm
A	mm
C	nice just sat there weren't it?
A	mm
B	well it's very countrified round there isn't it? you know
D	it is yes
B	you can just look out on the fields and that
D	I like looking out into the countryside
B	mm I do
D	yes
B	mm
C	without any
C	mm and these out at sea I showed you
D	mm
C	and er
D	mm
C	but not both
D	yes
D	mm
C	I forget whether it had or it hadn't
D	yes
C	and right there in the sea is there must have been about thirty wind farm you know
D	I know
C	mm
D	well we went to
B	mm
D	and in their sort of front room the drawing room er you could see wind turbines
B	could you?
D	yes and that's a listed building
B	yeah yeah
D	so I don't know what's happened there because generally wind turbines should not impact a listed building
C	mm hm
A	no that's true yeah
D	so obviously I'm not sure that enough weight has been attached
B	no
D	to the amenity
C	that that could be
B	mm
C	and we come to somewhere near
B	mm
C	eh they're really intimidating
D	mm
C	the road comes round and then you're going for them and then it just
B	there's about there's about fifteen isn't there?
D	yeah there was a lot yes
C	fifteen of them
D	yes
C	and they are they're
B	yeah
C	they're distracting to a driver
D	yes
B	yes
C	and they do distract you
D	you can't go affecting listed buildings
C	no
D	listed buildings are there for a reason
B	yes yeah
C	yeah
C	mm mm
D	yes
C	yeah
D	and er they've been restoring that
B	oh yes
C	mm
D	into a little hydroelectric plant I'll show you the pictures
C	is is it a watermill?
D	yes
C	yeah?
D	it's a real traditional watermill in actual stone
B	mm
D	it really looks good
C	going for his Ipad now
B	mm
C	it's er
B	got a bit of a headache
C	yeah twenty past one
B	mm
D	this is on the river
C	oh yes
D	mm
C	oh yes
D	yes
C	er with the wheel there
D	it is yes
C	water coming through here
D	mm
C	well
D	yes
C	just that one wheel?
D	just that one little wheel
C	did I tell you that er when we was cleaning well
D	yes
C	I came across this bike wheel with a dynamo in it
D	the recent oh the
B	doesn't it look beautiful
D	yes
B	yeah
D	yes
B	yes
D	fifty houses
A	what's that love?
D	the
B	that mill
A	oh yeah
B	mill
C	did did you go there
D	I've never been there no but it is in
C	no
D	yes
A	not far away is it?
D	no
B	mm we'll have to go another time
C	yeah
D	I I've been there there's supposed to be a footbridge that was part of the original design but erm they were hoping to try and restyle that as well
C	mm
B	mm
C	see that that would be worth a trip
D	mm yes it would be it's quite interesting yeah
C	it is we'll have to see if er
D	well I think that's much nicer than a wind turbine
C	oh I do mm
B	and I bet it has
D	mm yes I mean that's only a small little wheel that was intended to as a flour mill so it it's not
B	yes
C	I I say
D	that is a long time ago it's in the seventeen fifty-five
C	mm
B	yeah
C	that's some going ain't it?
A	mm
C	you know a watermill
A	yeah
C	and the thing is you can control it you see
D	mm
C	cos you can what they usually have on these rivers
D	yes
C	well further up they sort of widen it and have like a reservoir
D	yes
C	and from the reservoir the river comes
B	oh
D	mm
C	off the river comes another little river
D	yes they have a little diversion
C	that's it a diversion and they have er a a gate on it like a lock gate on it so if they don't want it they just shut the gate and the river continues
D	mm
C	but if they want to be er
A	grinding the flour
C	er jive that a bit and open that up and there we are
A	mm yes
C	and that and that can happen
D	I don't think the Derwent would freeze
C	not necessarily but
A	the Derwent won't but the baby river might freeze
C	yes yeah
C	and er
A	mm
C	he used water power but it didn't freeze up
D	mm
C	because it was a warm water
D	mm
C	er and there are these warm water springs
A	mm
D	yes
C	mm
D	mm
A	if it was the flour though you the harvest would be in say September so you'd be doing all your grinding in late September October by the time it's freezing
D	yeah
C	mm mm
A	November December you should have it all done hopefully
C	mm
A	erm I think that was later on
C	were they?
D	yes
C	mm I was gonna say the the bulbs wouldn't be out actually the first er house which had er electric lighting and that was er up in Scotland way I think
D	mm
A	mm
C	but but we certainly don't make enough use of er
D	no
C	water I mean when we've gone to to the Dales two or three times particularly with being on the coach and that
D	mm hm
C	have you seen
D	yes
C	you can see it's the power in it
A	you can hear it anyway
C	hear it thundering away there mm
B	yes
C	mm it's marvellous cos you see it's all running off the er moors and that
D	mm
C	and then er
D	yes
C	it peters down a bit a lovely picnic spot
D	mm mm
A	oh yeah
C	well
B	mm
C	because I heard on the wireless
B	mm
C	and it was saying where they were
A	yeah
D	mm
C	a working one
A	mm
C	you see? now that really interested me
A	mm surprised you didn't know about it anyway
B	mm
C	I didn't
B	mm
C	and behind the flour mill was a
A	really?
C	full of watercress all you know leaning cos it was running there and that
B	mm
C	I just forget what the the village was but there's a er
A	strangely yeah
C	mm
A	mm
D	mm
C	he says and you know there's something on it

C	and it must be in a way the start
D	mm
C	it goes round there fresh water in that and you had to be careful cos you could tell the ground was getting a little bit unsure
A	squidgy mm
C	and you looked up there and there was this biggest like half a field and the water's bubbling up out of there it's a it's a spring
A	mm
