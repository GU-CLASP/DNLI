C	yeah well yeah garden takes a lot of work I think so
B	did you sleep alright in there?
A	yes yeah
B	you didn't hear any noise from his or anything?
A	no no I didn't hear anything I kind of stayed up for a little bit actually
C	mm
A	and her friend pulled out so she's on her own all weekend so I feel a little bit bad about that
C	well you shouldn't feel bad because erm you er aren't the one who's let her down it's her friend who has
A	yeah and I mean she went home when I er she left me on my own for a few days didn't she when she came out she'll be fine she's got plenty of work to do so
C	mm
A	she'd getting on with that
C	well not the the the flat'll be spick and span when you turn up there again
A	yeah she's gone out to buy some more cleaning products today actually
C	mm
A	we didn't have any rubber gloves Marigold got to get some of those think she wants to give the bathroom a spruce
C	mm that's what you said yeah
A	is it okay to have lunch here before I go?
C	yeah that's fine
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cool
C	more like
B	no we haven't got anything planned at the moment
A	just more out in the garden
C	yeah well well we have quite a few different things on and you know as I say when it's dry and not too cold
A	it hasn't rained too
C	no
B	mm
A	no
B	no
C	August was was
A	mm
C	so September's actually been a warmer month that August
A	September was nice
C	mm
A	it's not actually that wet I looked at the the charts for how much you know water we actually get
C	mm
A	it averages about forty millimetres a month it's pretty much standard like across the whole year a little bit more in in erm November and those kind of months but I mean Korea in the height of their rainy season they receive two hundred and fifty millimetres in one month and that lasts for like two or three months
C	yeah
A	and then their lowest month is forty
C	yeah
A	so they they probably get about three or four times more rain than than we do but it it just rains more frequently in England than it
C	mm
A	it does in Korea does that make sense?
C	we had a very wet winter last winter and it was not cold it was wet erm a couple of days of frost no snow that was it then it was rain
A	was that the winter when there was terrible flooding?
C	yeah
B	we had the flooding year yeah
C	yeah last winter
B	there was
A	any around here?
B	erm yeah
C	no
C	mostly it was in the West Country
A	I remember erm
C	mm yeah
A	did that flood last winter?
C	mm I didn't go in
A	the country's slowly sinking
C	mm
A	so it was the West Country that was hit the most?
C	it took the brunt of it yeah
B	oh they really were and so does so did the erm east coast didn't it?
A	I remember seeing a train line had collapsed or something along the
C	Cornwall
A	along the coast
B	yeah Cornwall
C	Cornwall yeah
A	Cornwall
C	It was England and Cornwall must er England Cornwall Devon and Cornwall
A	yeah
C	mm
A	Scotland didn't get independence then
C	no
C	despite their engineering which they tried to engineer the erm the outcome by putting the erm vote down to the er the as sixteen I think Alex
A	not allowing Celtic people outside of Scotland to vote
C	no I don't know how they could
A	how can you say that if no no Scottish people living in England can't vote?
C	yeah it was
A	that's ridiculous
C	it was wrong erm they knew that if they hold there there's a hundred
A	that's quite high
C	I think they thought that if they can included them erm they would almost to a man vote to stay within the United Kingdom
A	yeah because otherwise they'd have to leave wouldn't they?
C	well they won't have to leave but because they if they joined
A	well it's if you're talking about the EU
C	well there'd be a well no they'd have to apply to the E er U erm there was a lot of
A	Pays Basque
C	and also erm Catalan which
A	yeah because
C	like turkeys voting for Christmas because they could see the breakup of their own country
A	yeah
C	Basque and erm would start making steps for a autonomy
A	it's not the way we should be going now is it? further divide
C	no
A	we should be trying to come together as a people
C	yeah also
A	I'm all for
A	European
C	also Salmond although a lot of bluster didn't convince people that we're regarding the pound he he he was
A	fifty-eight yeah
C	er and also if they had voted for this you're gonna have a lot of English people represented by the MPs who are going to be hacked off by this and also that the they've they've nailed their colours to the mast erm all three M all three leaders of the parties the Liberal er Democrats Labour and the Conservatives the government and the top
A	yeah
C	so erm so it would have been some going full going into this negotiations with the tail wagging the dog no erm you're not in a position to bargain really you'll you erm also I think the
B	do you want a cup of tea?
C	yes please and I think it also backfired
B	do you want one
A	no no
C	backfired with the young because the young were think I think they thought well
A	no
C	it suddenly
A	you're giving some people a lot of credit though I'm not sure if people are thinking that deeply but
C	I think the students might have been
A	yeah I mean the students
C	erm a lot of people would have also
A	wouldn't it be strange if they didn't get into the European Union though?
C	well the there's a good chance they wouldn't
A	mm
C	try going as a new country to the IMF
A	yeah
C	er let me think about you for a minute erm no
A	no
C	we're not gonna give you any money if we do we'll give you money but at the moment Great Britain
C	erm you're gonna have to put things up you're gonna have to put income tax up and stuff like that try and pay for it
A	sell off industry and privatise the
C	yeah erm you can't er er
B	do you want any toast or anything else?
A	do you have an apple?
B	yes
C	the problem is
C	we keep them in the fridge cos see how quickly the fruit goes
A	yeah
C	it's base it's base it's customer base erm
A	yeah I think I've heard that quote before
C	you can't do it
A	my opinion of him has been altered a little bit recently by researching pigeons and creoles he said had some terrible things he's said about those languages so basically racist he just
C	I think he probably was
A	there's some quotes that were just like you know this is a bastard English and broken from full of monkey stuff and I was just like bloody hell when I read some of his quotes prior to that I thought the guy was quite
C	he failed his er
A	language
C	entrance exam a couple of times into into Eton
A	yeah
C	and come from a good family erm yes er yes his flaws I think
A	did you ever watch Peaky Blinders?
C	yes it's back on again
A	he was in that it's back on again?
C	yeah
A	the second series?
C	yes
A	oh
C	yes
A	yeah he was portrayed in that wasn't he?
C	yes yeah erm Winston Churchill did er er you know he did get involved erm with some
B	thank you
C	things that weren't particularly nice er also he was very much into a big
B	yeah
C	fundamental gaps but erm
A	yeah
C	erm
A	mm
C	what?
A	you said Peaky Blinders is
C	is coming back on Thursday
A	oh it's coming back
C	yeah back on Thursday
A	oh advertising it
C	Sam Neill plays although he's from New Zealand plays an Irishman
A	yeah he did didn't he? oh is he from New Zealand he's a Kiwi?
C	yes Kiwi
A	I didn't know that
C	yeah
A	my friends are in erm New Zealand at the minute
C	oh right
C	oh right
A	erm before they come and stay with us in England they're travelling New Zealand for a few months
C	right
A	that's pretty nice they rented out a van and they're just kind of living out of the van
A	but it's still cold
C	it's still cold
A	yeah and they've just they've just hiked do you know Lord of the Rings the movie?
C	yes
A	erm
C	from yeah
A	mount doom or mourn or and they've just hiked that in a group but it's taken them to have crampons and ice axes cos it was like
C	yes
A	proper frozen and
C	yes well they've just erm their winters just end it their equivalent now are their erm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	kind of living quite cheaply out of the out of a van so
C	are they work were they working have they?
A	they worked in Korea
C	yes I know but did they leave when you left?
A	yes yeah their contract finished at the same time
C	oh oh I see so they're kind of gone on an extended holiday before they
A	yeah
C	till the money runs out and they have to go back and get a job
A	his er
C	okay
A	for two months and now and then
C	mm that's gonna be
A	yeah
C	cos they're they're they're you're meant to be on two different agendas their agenda is gonna be big fun your agenda is gonna be erm trying to do this and
A	I mean we're telling them at every step erm to a certain degree we don't owe them too much because when we visited them in in America they were working opposite shifts so we didn't actually really do anything with them when we saw
C	yes
A	we just kind of lived in the house for six weeks
C	yeah yeah
A	so erm we've told them we're gonna be busy with uni and like
C	they're gonna appreciate that
A	and they'll get on with their own stuff a lot
C	yeah
A	but but erm
C	mm
A	another two will be set two weeks prior to them coming so provided I'm just on top of everything
C	yeah
A	by the time they come
C	yeah
A	it should be okay
C	mm that's the mind see
A	yeah
C	for the year
A	was it a short course then?
C	yeah
A	tell you what if I'd have known about that course
C	mm
A	do one year at college
C	mm
A	get into a much better university than you could have possibly got into if you'd have done A levels
C	yeah
A	and erm receive funding as well
C	yeah I mean the work experience has been good for him
A	an access course yeah
C	it's yeah definite
A	I personally think
C	yeah well
A	I think you
C	yeah
A	should be made to take a three year gap whereby you really decide whether or not you want to go to university
C	yeah
A	try and save up some money to go
C	yeah
A	have a bit more of an understanding of what that kind of debt really is
C	yeah
A	it bothers me that you can turn you're a man and then
C	mm
A	for the next thirty years
C	we have
A	awful decision
C	we have erm
A	oh
C	but erm the chap
A	mm
C	erm but he curtailed his erm
A	mm
C	and what the mindset seems to be now is that
A	mm
C	which is definitely relevant and I said you're gonna be managing people and it's gonna like put a few people's noses out
A	mm
C	on a business on a business studies degree
A	yeah a degree yeah mm
C	and you're thinking and
A	I mean I understand to a certain degree why having a degree should enable you to take higher positions
C	mm
A	otherwise the whole purpose of university is just ruined
C	yes yeah
A	you know you know
C	but not to go in to run something that you've got
A	but not to immediately do that
C	not and then
A	you still need to prove your mettle and
C	yeah exactly
A	but it just should mean that you have the opportunity to step up
C	yeah
A	because you you've been
C	mm
A	well you've put the time and the money in as well
C	yeah
A	I mean half of the thing is if I put this amount of money into something
C	yeah
A	the whole idea is here's a course if you do this maybe I can get there but a lot of
C	yeah
A	graduates are coming out having done courses that don't relate to anything they they're just not
C	no
A	it's a problem
C	there is no substitute for experience you can be very intelligent but inexperienced and you will make mistakes because
A	yeah
C	you are inexperienced
A	I mean I think half the reason
C	mm
A	if I came straight out of
C	mm
A	I don't know if I I don't think I'd have got in to do linguistics at
C	mm mm
A	that
C	I like you said having the a bit of a working background erm
A	thank you
C	provide some assistance for a drainage solution there was a there's a there's a a garage along the high street and the our drainage went right through their for their land into the river and er so me and a guy called
A	oh

C	yes
A	making a whole degree out of studying someone's book and then
C	yeah
A	arty farty talking about what the hell I think it means

A	you can try it
C	I can try it
A	and if it's good enough quality you can do it
C	yeah
A	cos er it's it's a varying quality but
C	yeah
A	I definitely now I've got a bigger screen watched a couple of things
C	yeah
A	and been like oh that needs slightly better quality
C	yeah okay
A	Treme is quite good

C	right okay
A	that's alright?
C	yeah
A	now if you've already got a
C	mm
A	okay
C	erm the erm Chinese chess do you want to er?
A	yeah I wanna have a go definitely
C	okay
A	let me just bookmark this I just found a syntactic tree generator I need to bookmark that save
C	no I don't actually
A	it's quite useful
C	what's that something you bookmark through what?
A	why you use
C	sometimes yeah
A	so then if I have useful websites I bookmark them and then put them into separate folders and then folders into folders
C	I like my
A	but I have
C	oh right
A	my
C	right
A	computer just stopped working
C	your computer's just stopped working?
A	oh no it's working again the mouse stopped it like froze
C	right
A	for a second so
C	right erm
A	so how am I gonna do this then?
C	I'll come and sit next to you erm
A	I'm gonna sit on the bed
C	new game and I need to go erm
A	where did you find the Chinese chess game then? did you have to pay for it?
C	er er no er no free download on the Ipad
A	a free download that's good
C	yeah right so play okay right
A	yeah
C	erm it's er there's some right I've gotta teach you the right this
A	have you got enough room on here?
C	yeah I
C	need to start it up a little get again
A	cheers
C	so er it's so new game same game I done it one thing I don't like about this Ipad is you hit the wrong buttons
A	I find that in general about all these touch
C	mm I
A	oh I've got it's not allowing you to
C	so I actually when you touch the wrong button and it
A	no yeah
C	right
A	oh
C	I wanted new game and not
A	they are pretty nice though aren't they these? this
C	yeah
A	who uses it more?
C	er probably she does just about
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	it makes it so much harder I can I did memorise them but for simplicity it's easier to have these symbols right we'll go from that's the king he can only ever move erm
A	can he go back?
C	er yeah
A	yeah okay so
C	but he can only move in that box that's a palace
A	oh okay
C	that's the palace
A	you've gotta come out
C	now what you've got is
A	and you can't move diagonally in that box?
A	okay
C	so I'll take that back
A	within the palace I guess
C	within the palace that's all they can go in
A	okay
C	now what you've got then
A	okay
C	like that
A	can they cross the river?
C	no
A	take that one back again
C	and they can move to there to there unless there's something blocking it either an opponent or erm
A	and it take it you can't move into the palace?
C	no
A	no so you can only go that way and then that
C	knights move the same way as knights move but it it can be blocked but I have to
A	okay
C	your man or or
A	can't do
C	no
A	no which you can do in chess
C	yeah rooks do exactly the same so I don't need to tell you about what the rook
A	okay
C	what the rooks can do and what now the cannons are different now the cannons erm erm to take I can do this move it to there over the river
A	oh wow
C	or the other
A	you have to jump over something?
C	to take it
A	as if it's firing a cannon ball?
C	yeah if yeah to take it you can fire over your own man but it's it erm only takes the one it jumps over one thing you can't jump over two
A	and it can't hit the thing
C	no
A	it's got to jump over something
C	it it takes whatever's behind it
A	okay
C	so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go into a game and you've
A	what about these things here?
C	they're pawns or sorry pawns do as er pawns go up
A	okay
C	once they go forward though and across the river they can't come back they can only keep moving forwards or sideways okay?
A	and you take in a similar fashion you take diagonally?
C	no you take straight ahead straight on
A	oh right
C	I'm gonna like now I'll go through a game and give you some like the tactics
A	so is this what the chess that we play is based on?
C	no
A	no
C	but there are
A	is this more complex?
C	a little bit yeah
A	it is yeah it looks it
C	right so what I'll do is er there's various different types of attack what you want to try and do is get out your rooks as soon as you possibly can but you you're moving to
A	oh he did move it into the palace
C	you well you can right at the edge but you can't go inside it
A	okay
C	okay? erm so what I do then is erm
A	puts a whole different spin on it if you take vertically rather than
C	yeah
A	diagonally
C	he's done the same I'm going to bring
A	and is the end of the game to checkmate
C	yeah
A	your opponent?
C	there's no draws in this
A	okay
A	there's no draw
C	right
A	why is there no draw?
C	I just just the rules this a winner there's no draw
A	look like in chess where you can keep running around each other can you do that in the same in this? no
C	yeah no I don't think you can do that no right so that's that he's moved his his I'm gonna move my erm castle out as well
A	so I'm glad you play it
C	yeah
A	very
C	so he's that now attacking that pawn there
A	oh
C	okay? er to defend it what I'll do is I'll move that to there which means he can be taken by that but then I go like that
A	and take him
C	but now I'm going to what's known as chain chain my er my er er is it? I'm getting confused here they're either ministers counsellors I'm gonna chain them they're now chained together are you with me? if that was there and that or they're chained so let me see if that gets taken they'll take it back okay
A	just automatic though?
C	yeah well you could you don't have to do that
A	okay
C	but you that's what you you
A	yeah
C	you're protecting each other they're chained together
A	because it has to jump over something?
C	has
A	yeah
C	if you right so if I was to move that there he will take me that's the most valuable piece that's the second most valuable that's the third that's the fourth er
A	do these play much?
C	they're just defending the in in the palace
A	yeah
C	okay? so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna my pawn up to there he's moved down he's coming in and he could slide that down to there but he won't because I've still got that there
A	it completely changes the game doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	he's now took he took he took my my erm my knight and he's put me in check now to get out of check I
A	oh
C	yeah exactly or I'd do that
A	yeah okay
C	that's the move but what I'm gonna do is take these back
A	oh you can go back as far as you want
C	yeah cos I'm I'm just showing you what
A	no okay
C	so to protect that knight now
A	pawns can't move sideways I take it?
C	no
A	no
C	I will move that up to there that's now
A	is he attacking?
C	well he's not attacking anything directly but what I can do now is to to get him to move is
A	how long did it take you to get to grips with this?
C	probably about an hour
A	oh
C	and then I would make mistakes so he's now defended that by putting that down
A	yeah I mean it changes the whole dynamic of the game doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	it's like chess but not like chess
C	yeah so what I do now is I'm gonna threaten his erm now his rook by putting my cannon there
A	mm
C	he will move that which means I will take that cannon
A	yeah okay so he's gonna get something
C	because if he doesn't yeah I'm gonna get something out of that
A	what setting are you playing this one?
C	easy
A	yeah
C	he's taken one of my ministers
A	yeah
C	but erm
A	he can take another one as well
C	I've he's but I will take that okay he will take he's come back up to there and taken that
A	cannons are quite important then aren't they?
C	he he will have lost a cannon now because
A	mm
C	I've still got one I lost a I lost a counsellor
A	a counsellor that's what they're called
C	so now what I need to do is is protect my cannon so I move it I could move it to there and it's protected by that and that er by the L shape
A	mm
C	taking but what I'm going to do is erm
A	yeah okay
C	see that?
A	it's a bit hard to see it over the river isn't it?
C	yes
A	what's the purpose of the river?
C	erm
A	it's just that certain parts can't cross over there?
A	pawns don't seem to do much
C	it's straight on yeah it's straight on so what
A	can the pawns move two spaces at the beginning?
C	no just the once so I'm gonna try a little tactic now I'm gonna move it up to here
A	yeah defending it
C	defending that minister by by doing that that's fine
A	and the rook can jump over another rook?
C	no
A	but you said you were gonna move this here and then
C	I was and then double up but he's
A	and attack with this one
C	yeah
A	okay
C	and it would be checkmate if he
A	have you played this against real people?
C	no
A	and what setting can you get to on the computer?
C	er
A	just easy?
C	I I can beat it er I can beat it a lot of the times on easy not every time and the normal and there's like three
A	yeah
C	well I've only ever beaten it once
A	you've beaten it once
C	it's yeah it's quite tough
A	so there's quite a bit of strategy to it then there must be
C	indeed yeah
A	look at that yeah
C	so
A	isn't it attacking the king now because it can jump over the?
C	no no there's nothing it the it's only attacking it if there's a piece in
A	oh if there's something
C	in between it yeah
A	oh so it can attack this I mean
C	yeah but he's put that as far as I'm concerned he's put that in a in a bad place
C	because now what I'm gonna do is
A	yeah
C	er counsellors
A	counsellors
C	right
A	yeah okay
C	that there
A	next turn
C	he is now attacking it so now what I do is I should be able to attack that pawn
A	yeah
C	take that pawn and there's he can take that pawn I'm not worried about that
A	where do these ones move again?
C	diagonally
A	diagonally like a bishop?
C	yeah he he's he's erm
A	oh
C	you know what I mean? in normal chess you can go like that I can't
A	you can't just move it yeah
C	cos I'm boxed in so what I've gotta do is protect it
A	mm
C	I can't move it out of that it's gone unfortunately so and there's nothing I can do to to protect it
A	it's gone
C	but now I'm attacking
A	and can
C	that's how
A	your cannon jump over your own piece?
C	yes
A	does that count as a jump?
C	I yeah I I could take
A	because you've got your own piece there
C	that but I I'm gonna do is it with my
A	hang on a minute oh no yeah
C	he's he doesn't need to it there's nothing he if that he can't have anything blocking that er said look even his own piece of mine
A	yeah yeah cos you yours is taken
C	but I can now take a piece of his if I've got a good piece by he's lost that now and I'll show you how when I take that down here that puts him into check he had to move than I then do that and I've taken his but I lost that
A	can you take that back just so I can see? you moved it down here and said it put him into check how?
C	yes because
A	oh because your rook was
C	yes that exposes the rook
A	okay so yeah so
C	okay so he can't do that so I'll take I will take another tack now I now put him back into check there he's gone back there so erm
A	you were gonna take this piece weren't you?
C	yeah erm but I'm I've now changed my tack so if I go like that again he goes there
A	just keep going backwards and forwards
C	I go to there now I'm attacking that what did he do there? oh he just took a pawn okay still not a problem erm I'm still chained so if he takes that I'll take him back
A	yeah
C	but now what I do is I take his
A	and now you'll take him back
C	I can't because it it's I put my king into a check
A	oh okay yeah
C	are you with me? so now I've gotta do something so what I do now
A	the chain's a bit wide
C	is I go like
A	quite a lot of blood in this game isn't there?
C	yeah now I'm in check I've got to block that with my
A	you move there
C	I'll do it again to see it's it's
A	yeah that was quite good
C	and then I'll let you have a go
A	oh well can't we play against each other?
C	well you can but it's easier to learn against something that you can come back because it it's quite complicated cos it's in Chinese symbols
A	yeah
C	you've gotta first memorise all those
A	that's half the fun isn't it?
C	you've got to memorise all those symbols
A	there's only about six symbols though that shouldn't take me too long
C	yeah but it's remembering what they are in in in relation to the board so now right I'll one how I normally work
A	can you not play two player on this? is there no way I can do this and you do that?
C	no just
A	if we put it in the table
C	no it's just er
A	is there a two player?
C	not on this I don't think it's just you against the computer
A	that's very disappointing
C	erm right so
A	he's just mirroring you
C	I'm then gonna do that to attack that pawn but he might take mine and I take his back bomb
A	and he lost a cannon then
C	that I lost a cannon we both traded off a cannon
A	oh did you lose one as well?
C	I'm attacking that he's attacking that so to defend that now I go
A	that's quite quick
C	he lost that
A	you don't normally play chess this quickly?
C	I lost that no
A	when you normally play do you play this quickly?
C	yeah
A	cos I'd say you were on the normal game of chess you were more cautious
C	oh er I am much more yeah I do try to think so now
A	I don't believe there's not a two player version of this on here surely
C	just defended that
A	is it worth losing?
C	mm
A	it's actually moving a bit quickly for me to you know keep hold of it
C	yes erm
A	lost so many pieces so quickly only been on for two minutes
C	yeah
A	and like the game's
C	mm mm
A	you can take his cannon but he'll take yours
C	no yeah but I'm I'm gonna I can't no I can't take that
A	why not?
C	it's cos it's not diagonal I can only go in
A	oh okay
C	so I have to go like that
A	you didn't wanna lose that
C	was that lost? no I didn't lose anything so I did that so now what I need to do is erm he would
A	you've lost so many pieces is it not hard to check each?
C	yeah it yeah it
A	mm
C	so he's put me in check
A	computer doesn't take long to think at all no
C	no
A	oh
C	I've lost that one
A	you're gonna lose this?
C	yeah
A	purposefully of course just to show me
C	no no I just I'm just doing it fast right I'm gonna lose that game so I'll now do one to win I'm going to to actually try to play to win now and I'll just go through the motions right what you're trying to do is get things like in chess working together like pieces a pair of scissors
A	yeah
C	and things like they are take er separate the scissors and they're just stabbing weapons but put them together and they cut things so
A	yeah do
C	yeah
A	analogy
C	yeah so what I do is erm
A	oh lame
C	something like lame something
C	yes like that sort of thing they say
C	erm different sayings
A	have you got a book on it then? it's
C	yeah
A	did I buy you a book on it? I think I did yeah
C	er I think you did yes
A	yeah
C	so you go to there
A	nice
C	yeah but you can move now sideways or forwards but you can't move backwards it's because
A	okay so prior to him crossing the river he can only move forwards?
C	he can move one forwards yeah one space
A	but then now he can move
C	now he can move one space left or right or forward
A	interesting are there any other pieces that change
C	no
A	the abilities of yeah crossing the river
C	just the just the pawns just the pawns er let's see how we go
A	the pawns look more like tents
C	mm
A	I've yurt
C	mm
A	with Mongolia
C	mm yes they did yes and Genghis Khan
A	yeah
C	or his real name Temüjin
A	hence the Great Wall
C	mm
A	I've been to the Great Wall
C	yes yeah I know you have
A	it's quite impressive I went in the winter as well
C	yes he did er Temüjin reaped quite a lot of destruction in China
A	I mean he went as far as Europe didn't he?
C	yes he did
A	which is
C	yeah
A	quite impressive
C	yeah yes
A	and sired a few few children on the way didn't
C	well well they reckon er one in every two hundred men on the planet can trace their ancestry back to
A	that's insane
C	mm
A	er surely not I mean if you think about it obviously it's a lot more difficult for women but for a guy you could sire I mean how many children a day?
C	mm once they'd
A	I mean two or three a day?
C	once they he captured the chiefs' wives they became his wives
A	mm
C	they were his property and obviously he impregnated them and all that and
A	don't see how
C	we've got the
C	really spread the progeny around
A	yeah
C	yeah they did
A	bloody hell
C	yeah
A	so when you say one in two hundred though that statistic surely must be a much higher in certain areas in I mean surely like one in
C	no I think they've averaged that out as over the world
A	yeah not one in two hundred people in England or
C	no no no er in the world
A	yeah in the world
C	in the world yeah
A	so that's quite a few of them being Chinese or
C	yes exactly
A	or or whatever er
C	right er I'm trying to get him he's
A	mm
C	so going try and do something to get him out of the way
A	why was that a mistake?
C	I've I've because I forgot about that that that being there that
A	mm
C	defended that
A	is there any significance to these other markings on the board?
C	no not as far as I know
A	but you can take his cannon now
C	I am and I want that that's what I actually want I would quite happily
A	or he will take your cannon
C	now
A	or take that you can now move sideways though can't you?
C	er
A	so if you move your knight there
C	well it was yeah now what I want to do is move no what did I do that for? that was a stupid move I meant to do that
A	unless you can take it back
C	if he takes that that's where I've got him
A	is that it?
C	yes
A	I mean that went pretty quick
C	yeah right so you have a go
A	okay let's have a look
C	as I said if you make a mistake
C	not a problem
A	let me have a look as I'm sure you can play two player in this I'm sure of it you went to new game it says human versus computer
C	yeah
A	so surely you can do human versus human in some way
C	well it would have that in the menu
A	human versus human
C	oh you can
A	yeah
C	oh I've never I've never bothered to do that er
A	would you like to try?
C	yeah go on then
A	so er
C	there you go I've never bothered to try it because obviously
A	no so you move first what now? what do you
C	play yeah
A	so there you go so if we sit it
C	okay
A	on on the bed
C	I didn't realise that because like I said what's the point? I don't
A	no no
C	so why would I play against myself?
A	I thought they must do there's gotta be a way of
C	yeah yeah but er
A	playing two play if we both sit on the bed is that the best way of doing it?
C	er so can you
A	if you could sit there and I sit here then it
C	and it's the which er colour's the one that goes first? er it looks like
A	I'm red
C	you're gonna go first by the looks of it
A	yeah yeah is that alright?
C	yeah you're gonna go first that's okay yeah
A	right so what kind of moves did you say are good I the beginning I've forgotten now
C	erm to get your
A	get your knights out of the corner
C	it says er er erm a good erm chess player will have have his rook out by by the at least the third move so you're trying to
A	okay so you've gotta free up space for your rook?
C	yeah
C	no that's fine
A	it's a bit of a
C	that's why I thought well with the the computer you could er
A	hit or miss
C	er you you go first though
A	yeah this is all good I'm like I prefer to play you I think
C	yeah okay
A	it's definitely harder to see like
C	yeah
A	the strategy's completely different
C	yeah it is
A	this is nice though isn't it?
C	yeah
A	I'm just gonna move for now I'm just gonna throw my weight around
C	feel
A	see how it goes
C	don't blame you
A	cos when you were playing against the computer you guys are moving fast but
C	mm
A	okay so you're not attacking me with anything
C	no
A	and then you take my oh
C	yeah you
A	that was a terrible move
C	yes
A	you anticipate that's why you moved out
C	yes that's correct yeah
A	okay
C	you're punished for that mistake
A	yeah we won't take anything back we'll just erm
C	but you
A	mm
C	I don't do anything without any reason
A	no no
C	mm
A	so that that would be absolutely useless
C	mm
A	these move diagonally?
C	yeah
A	can they move like across the board like that?
C	no they no they can only get to the river they can't go ahead of it
A	no they can't go beyond it
C	no
A	so bringing them out
C	you just bring them out
A	but that was a piece in there wasn't there?
C	yeah they can go one of yeah that was actually a good move by you because otherwise you'd have lost that check
A	what would I have lost?
C	you'd have lost your rook cos you I've now put you in check you've got to either move your king forward or move that minister out the way sorry counsellor out the way
A	yeah
C	and you would have then lost your knight if that was still there I'd have taken it
A	I'd have lost some there
C	yeah
A	which is a better move?
C	are you well erm that's entirely up to you the at this point there's no merit in there's no advantage I can see of er er
A	cos I'm gonna lose one of these anyway aren't I?
C	I would move the minister myself to protect that one okay?
A	I'm getting worked
C	mm
C	attack
A	I can attack you here can I?
C	er yes you can like when that er that's made me vulnerable you can go back to there
A	mm
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	so you're defending
C	yeah
A	now
C	that will be yes
A	and then he'll be attacking
C	yeah you can't I don't think you can move there but you can move it to there and that would be threatening my my
A	yeah dunno what's going on there
C	cannon
A	yeah should be okay on that front
C	no
A	oh okay
A	so can I take that back?
C	if you were er yeah you
A	no okay well we won't take anything back
C	well take it back if you want to
A	no no that's fine
C	mm wait and see
A	mm
C	erm
A	with all the touching and everything
A	you know what I mean?
C	yeah everybody does that
A	how much are they?
C	I dunno
A	they're not cheap are they?
C	no they're not cheap no that's that's that's er for sure
A	and these are worth more than these?
C	no the rooks are
A	cos they move inwards? the rooks are the most valuable then the cannon and the
C	yeah rook cannon knight er minister counsellor
A	so it's outside inside
C	the
A	so you're not gonna take this if you're gonna lose that?
C	no
A	presumably
C	unless it's er the unless I can see a
A	a strategic
A	yes
C	I won't rule it out
A	these can't move over so there's
C	they can only move until they cross the river yeah then they can
A	not too much point in moving there
C	yeah knights knights and rooks can they just er
A	they just don't move very far though do they?
C	no
A	okay so now you can take my knight
C	no I can't
A	oh you can take my pawn
C	yeah I can't take your knight
A	yeah it's confusing yeah sure
C	well move something forward you
A	no
C	you ought to have a try and get them to work or get something up there to help them to help them work
A	cos pawns can't move sideways can they? so that's
C	no
A	is it difficult to find a download to this?
C	no
A	just google Chinese chess?
C	you might be able to get it on your computer I did look but erm
A	yeah I mean I wouldn't mind playing this with
C	to
A	although it's a lot better format playing it on this thing
C	yes
A	than trying to both do it on my computer although she does have a tablet I bought her one
C	if she's got a tablet she'll be able to download
A	it's not as big as this though
C	no
A	it's a smaller one but
C	yeah well you might be able to work with it with with that
A	it's difficult to play actually
C	you might be able to work with that
A	we went through a stage of playing chess with each other quite a lot
C	oh right
A	we were like travelling but I haven't really it was several years ago now
C	yeah
A	or rook
C	mm
A	mm
C	not sure if can erm yes I can I can take
A	take it
C	do you do you want to back do you want to move it?
A	no no no
C	no go on take it mate cos it was it was a silly move
A	erm
C	mm
A	if I move my knight here is the defending the rook?
C	er he's defending the rook yeah
A	yeah
C	er er I would've said but no he's no he's not defending it's too far away from the rook
A	yeah
C	but you you're attacking that and that pawn there
A	oh
C	just the one
A	just the
C	either they're the enemy or themselves
A	don't know what to do
C	no cos you've got that's blocking you your other man's blocking you
A	oh
C	so
A	wow
C	see that's he your pawn is blocking you there as well you can go backwards but you can't go forwards
A	can't go forwards
C	yeah it tells you lights up where you can go the two spaces that it goes there or there that's it
A	mm
C	two
A	two
C	just two
A	so if I move him there he's not attacking you?
C	if you move what what?
A	the rook here
C	no it's not attacking me no
A	it's not cos you'll go through him
C	yeah he won't be able to that's
A	I'm in the way so blocking is quite serious
C	yeah
A	mm
C	er yeah once well well
A	you'll move
C	well in the castle er within the
A	the fortress
C	with the
A	so if I'm attacking your knight
C	yeah
A	then he's not defending the knight
C	yeah that's quite correct
A	oh it becomes uncomfortable sitting cross legged doesn't it?
C	mm
A	I always make stupid mistakes like that
C	yeah
A	oh
C	yep you've got me into check
A	I'm so confused about this cannon it has to jump over something
C	yes
A	so if I move him here he's not attacking my rook he's attacking well he can't be attacking that cos it's the same piece but
C	yeah
A	he's not attacking that rook
C	no
A	no but I am attacking him
C	yeah
A	but he's defended by this
C	yeah
A	and this cannon can take this piece here
C	he could do but then I would take him with my
A	with your king
C	king cos I can I can do that
A	yeah
C	sorry my counsellor
A	and so this course of action
C	no
A	oh he's attacking that
C	yeah
A	oh it's confusing it has to jump
C	yeah yeah
A	why does it have to jump over something? I don't really understand that
C	yeah er it's firing over to get to hit someone
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	shoot with this dude
C	no
A	an interesting concept
C	yeah
A	I don't know how to do that but
A	but let's say if I lose if I take this lose my cannon but take another one at least
C	mm
A	that seems very restricting
C	mm
A	crap
C	er
A	yeah?
C	yeah I I want to see if you would you would find that out or not
C	yes yeah yeah
A	you didn't make a mistake?
C	no no
C	I thought I'd give you a
C	thing there
C	mm
A	might be useful
C	owing to the fact that you've either lost your knight or you've lost one of your
A	yeah just don't really wanna resign to that at the minute
C	this er
A	and a knight's worth more
C	yes
B	would you like a drink?
C	erm coffee would be nice my love
A	erm no I've got water thanks
C	yeah
A	move him there
C	yeah yeah
A	why can't he move that way?
A	know what I mean?
C	to be honest you've lost him either way cos even if you move there er he's gone
A	but if I'd have been able to move him here
C	yeah
A	he'd be defending him
C	yeah
A	but he's not it doesn't work that way
C	but you can't cos you're your own man is er stopping you from doing it
A	mm it's troublesome
C	yeah
A	very little point in worrying about him unless no I can't do two moves at once can I?
C	no
A	mm
C	I would move him because then cos if you don't you'll cannon becomes immediately threatened and I I'm forcing you to do things
A	mm
C	yeah I would yeah
A	so I draw this down rather than
C	yeah
A	drawing it out that way
C	because otherwise if you've left him there and I took him that's then immediately under threat
A	yeah
C	mm can get trapped yeah
A	yeah
C	no you but by two pieces a by your
A	yeah
C	your erm counsellor and by your king
A	so this shape makes quite a strong hold doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	it makes a good defence
C	mm
A	mm
C	yeah
A	I can't really get into anything
C	directly
A	bugger
C	yeah
A	or I jump over him but I'd be attacking this not this so it doesn't make sense
C	yeah and you yeah you can't jump over erm cos you've gotta take something with it to jump
A	can he get to the end and be
C	yeah threatening directly your king yeah
A	but can he be made into a new piece like in chess?
C	no no
A	no
C	that is what he is he can only move forwards and sideways I can't move him backwards
A	no no no and he can't be made into a well
C	no
A	there is no queen is there? so
C	no but he's now got skills he can take anything
A	yeah yeah so he's of use
C	yeah
A	and this can't jump too?
C	no
A	how do I tease something out of this area? I don't really
C	you're attacking the wrong side
A	is on this side
C	but you're attacking that they're you're attacking you're going against the wall rather than going around the wall
A	it just takes so many moves to get over there is the problem
C	yeah
A	and I've and you keep chasing me so I've gotta
C	mm
A	move this or I
C	you're you're you're on the on the back foot
A	yeah
C	I'm keeping you on the back foot
A	mm
C	yeah take it back
A	mm
C	mm
A	what is your plan?
C	mm
A	I don't really understand how to do that
B	will you come and get it?
C	yeah
A	I'm not a cheater where we are is I'm losing and struggling to see where to move
C	er no not really just
A	I can't move him here cos he's attacking him here
C	mm
A	moving there would be pointless cos he's blocked in again
C	yeah
A	I can't move him out because he's gonna attack him
C	well you could move him right back you can see all the lines of where you can go you can either move one that space or all the way down that line
A	mm true
C	er you'll find that no is the answer to that
C	mm mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	what is the time?
C	twenty past eleven just gone
A	okay we should probably have lunch around about midday shouldn't we really?
C	yeah yeah
A	if we're going to mum is picking me up around about one what were you having for lunch?
C	pass don't know
A	does
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah I'd rather
A	does she know that I've gotta go at one?
C	yeah
A	yeah cool
C	right you've done that okay
A	yeah but not for long could just move him back couldn't you?
C	or I can just take you with that
A	oh bugger
C	so take it back
A	oh
C	see that's a good defence I've got there
A	yeah it's a really good defence I can't get into that at all
C	this thing is forgetting the capabilities of what the pieces can do
A	mm
C	no so you're moving straight there and forgetting that that could come back and take you
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	like two across
C	yeah
A	right that is definitely a bit confusing trying to play old chess on
C	yeah
A	new chess are there any other variations of chess that you've come across?
C	not to my knowledge no
A	no just Chinese chess and western chess yes
C	yeah
A	that was a positive
C	correct
A	and er you're you can't move diagonally so you're only
C	no
A	threatening this bishop thing
C	I I'm no your your erm
A	oh what? oh crap
C	you didn't I was move that
A	no oh it's confusing
C	you can see now I'm attacking both of your counsellors
A	yeah okay and there's no way of
C	yeah yeah
A	I was like oh yeah I've
C	yeah well you've saved him
A	took this bit yeah
C	you've saved him is he's
A	and then my but my king can take
C	yes he can
A	you so he's only gonna lose one of them
C	but er so the for me it's a it's a good
A	oh yeah yeah definitely
C	unless it it was strategically erm erm relevant for me not to do that
A	mm
C	no
A	so he's next to useless
C	which one?
A	this guy
C	yes yes
A	all he can do is go there there there or there
C	yeah
A	really I mean I mean he's
C	exactly he's more of a
A	in this quadrant yeah
C	he's a defensive
A	mm
C	rather than a attack
A	so I should have moved him out
C	erm
A	oh it's not going yeah
C	no
A	I'm seeing it wrong
C	well well yeah
C	mm
A	yeah this is a really strong defence I don't know how to break this
C	oh right
A	us not talking is this nearly game over?
C	check
A	you're just homing in this is a slow and painful death
C	check
A	I can take that but you'll take me
C	no you can't cos I've put you in check
A	oh bugger
C	in there
A	take my piece it's game over isn't it? I can't really do anything now
C	new game yeah
A	cos I'm the loser
C	spin it round this time I'll play it so it's just as it is I'm I'm you and
A	yeah yeah that's it's good I'm I'm dad am I?
C	yeah
A	the daddy
C	look at my shoes
A	yeah
C	how much did it cost for your train fare to get up here when you do you get a student like card or something or?
A	it's forty pound return
C	oh right
A	it's not cheap is it?
C	no it's not okay
A	erm but there's I can get home cheaper so basically I got the reason I was happy to come home when I went back last time
C	yeah
A	it cost me
C	mm
A	or forty pound return
C	yeah
A	with the one month return
C	yeah
A	so I was er well rather than just paying the thirty-five it's your birthday
C	yeah
A	if I pay five pound more then I can
C	yeah
A	come back so I paid forty and then there's another special ticket that only runs after
C	right yeah
A	and I don't return in the day
C	no no no
A	but that's only twenty pound but you can't buy it from the train station it has to be bought from the tourist office
C	oh right okay
A	so mum's bought me a twenty pound day return so it's gonna cost me twenty quid to get home
C	okay
A	if you know what I mean
C	oh that's nice
A	so it's cheaper so but I won't then have a return ticket to get back
C	yeah
A	I mean I suppose I could hang around the train station and try and sell someone a day return to
C	erm when you come over at Christmas I'll erm
A	are you sure?
C	yeah
A	you don't mind?
C	I'll just transfer you the
A	cool
C	and that will be for the
A	yeah thank you very much
C	it's a lot easier than us having to
A	no I wouldn't expect you to drive up
C	so
A	definitely wouldn't expect that
C	it's a bit of a
A	okay so what mistake did I make at the beginning?
C	you didn't really
A	who was that on the phone?
C	er it's mum
C	right here we go right let's do this
C	no I no cos I
C	yeah well focus your mind to task after this game
A	left something on the board there
C	yeah
A	bit of crap
C	it's got a screen over it there's like a film over this to protect it
A	oh you can see it yeah it's a protector
C	yes a protector film
A	necessary a lot of people crack their screens don't they? I've seen people like drop it and
C	yeah
A	so what would you say comes out first? you
C	your yeah your rook you wanna get your knights you don't wanna be wasting time with this pawns or the central pawn
A	just these two?
C	yeah
A	because that frees up space for
C	yeah
A	what to come out?
C	correct
A	yeah I find these cannons a bit confusing
C	mm
A	a bit difficult
C	yeah
A	to see what the hell's going on really
C	yeah it's mastering the
A	and if I mirror you I'm attacking that bit
C	yeah
A	so what's the purpose of moving these forwards? what's that clearing that space out
C	they would stop the knights coming out cos you know when I said that knight's being blocked by
A	yeah
C	it blocks the knights
A	okay
C	yeah?
B	what did you say? I didn't hear you
C	I was just continuing the joke that you want to reserve that for sunbathing
B	oh
C	I was said do you want me to move the sun lounger?
A	I'm still a bit confused by the knights as well if I move there I'm not attacking that am I?
C	yes you are
A	I am?
C	yeah
A	I thought it only went
C	no you're no no
A	to there
C	you're attacking it yeah you're attacking it
A	so then surely if I'm attacking that from there then here there should be a yellow dot here why is there no yellow dot?
C	no
A	oh cos he's in the way
C	yes yeah
A	okay
C	so now I need to do something about that
A	you can just take my other pawn aren't you?
C	well no because if I did that you'd take me with that
A	oh yeah
C	er
A	oh because thinking you were taking that pawn
C	yeah so I I drop him back to that line
A	okay
C	er well you should have been able to maybe I'm wrong
A	I'm a bit confused about the knights
C	oh ah I've
A	yeah
C	but erm
A	it seems like they
C	yeah
A	not two across one up
C	yeah yeah that's it yeah that's my mistake yeah
A	because er in chess
C	yeah
A	they can go either can't they?
C	yeah I needn't have moved that
A	no
C	I was but I felt threatened by it so I I thought it was that yeah
A	did you wanna take it back?
C	no it's
A	I'm sure you do
C	yeah
A	take it back
C	alright take it back
A	how did you do it? I understand
C	yes
A	yeah I just put myself in
C	just right in the firing line
A	vulnerability yeah
C	yeah straight in the firing line
A	which I didn't wanna do
C	but you'd then
A	with him but the knight is blocking it yeah
C	mm that's just defended it
A	so I don't wanna do that
C	yeah it's defending
A	isn't it defending that and that?
C	it's defending that that cannon at the moment so is that one
A	okay
C	no
A	what?
C	mm
A	and if I move this
C	mm
A	so I can move
C	you can move a minister that you've lost your
A	my rook
C	yeah
A	what?
C	like I said it's just it's a game of tactics
A	oh jesus and I have none
C	tactics
A	that's the problem
C	mm
A	I think that's the
C	mm
A	oh god it's just game over isn't it already and he's not
C	well
A	able to move there
C	no I've still lost my knight though
A	yeah
C	I can't do anything about that
A	no still I'm losing on points
C	you realise your rook is your your your cannon is directly under attack?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	although no that's not my pawn sorry I was seeing this red pawn as being my pawn erm
C	yeah which means I then attack it here and you've said goodbye to that
A	oh
C	no there's nowhere you can move it you can't even take anything with it to just and then lose it that way
A	so the
C	it's gone
A	well actually is it gone? I mean if aren't I putting you in check?
C	if you do that you've put me in er check
A	so you have to move out of check before I lose my cannon?
C	yeah and the way I'd do that is to go there
A	okay
C	which you your cannon is still under attack
A	erm okay
C	I'll take you out with one of the ministers
A	yeah with one of the
C	the counsellors
A	erm
C	mm
A	he's not attacking him no
C	no
A	rook these pawns block your
C	mm
A	rooks I don't know how to get him out
C	I
A	you can't
C	sorry?
A	if I move here and then you attack it with one of the ministers then I attack your king
C	well try it
A	don't you? you can attack it with the king but not with the
C	I could I could erm take it out with one of those I believe let's see if I'm if I'm mistaken no
A	you can't because
C	no no
A	I'm attacking your
C	I can take it straight with that
A	with the king yeah
C	yeah so you don't wanna move there
A	no
C	yeah see see where you're
A	really see where you're yeah where you're going
C	where you can go
A	so all is lost on that front
C	mm
A	then I guess I need to do something he can't go anywhere else
C	well the resign to the fact that that's gone
A	okay so what would you do with the other pieces?
C	move something else
A	yeah I mean it's not coming out very easily though is he?
C	no well there's it's moves isn't it?
A	it's like three moves
C	yes
A	before I can actually get the damn thing out
C	yeah exactly
A	bugger
C	yeah
A	which
C	I would leave him where he is he's in a very strong position there
A	he's in a good position
C	I can't like do that
A	no
C	I can't do that
A	so leave him where he is it's your go
C	yeah
A	so I probably wasn't gonna buy people much other than a token gift
C	no don't yes don't worry about getting me nothing if you're
A	and part of my thing was coming home
C	yeah no no no yeah don't worry about getting me er something because er you've already paid that meal that would've been very expensive so that's my Christmas and my birthday
A	no I mean I mean I'll get everyone a token something but it's not gonna be like
C	no just get me a DVD or something
A	yeah
C	something a DVD is fine I don't want any more than that
A	do that yeah but I'm gonna be quite poor
C	yes I know
A	I think by the time
C	well yeah
A	I think we will
C	like I said erm I mean I don't know when you get paid for this thingy of yours
A	I haven't been paid yet I should get paid for twenty-
C	mm
A	this recording now I won't get paid this until the end of November
C	no
A	okay
C	yeah no a token gesture for is is fine
A	except I was a bit worried about Christmas
C	yeah but
A	by anything because he'll be
C	he'll be taken by that
A	he just can't move sideways
C	no he'd just
A	yeah
C	he'd be taken
A	so
C	yeah keep er no I'd keep him on that line
A	he's a good fella to have
C	yeah
A	okay but a cannon is worth more than a bishop
C	yeah strategically yeah
A	but if maybe not actually I mean I might as well do that why did you move that in then?
C	mm
A	did you not see that? or is there some ulterior motive going on
C	mm there'll always be an ulterior motive
A	half the game is convincing me there is isn't it?
A	wanna take it back
A	what? let's take it back it's not fair
A	okay so you're luring me in so that happened because
C	er you were
A	why did that attack my king? I don't understand I took that
C	yeah but then I had two attacking that plus that attacking that it I
A	you can't jump two though can you?
C	he was in check no he was in check once you took that I took that you couldn't move that out the way you couldn't move that that way cos he's in check
A	no let's see this again so I take this
C	yeah
A	you take what?
C	I go like that
A	that
C	he can't move out of check he can't move that out the way it moves diagonally he can't move that one line cos he's still in check he hasn't got himself out of check
A	bugger I didn't see that
C	okay
A	do you mind me taking it back?
C	no
A	okay I'll just go for this then
A	but is there no way out of that?
C	no
A	oh
C	you were out er classed
A	oh bloody hell that was a good game
A	no yeah
C	you'll make mistakes and what happens is I make less mistakes
A	I'll try and download
C	so yeah
A	I mean I'll save that I haven't really got much time for playing chess at the minute but
C	no no you
C	to be honest it it's something to to to have another pop when you come over at Christmas
A	yeah we'll have another go
C	but forget about it yeah you've got you're doing too many things you don't want to stretch yourself too thin
A	definitely not
C	erm it erm yes
A	that was good though I like it
C	erm
A	it's a completely different dynamic
C	it
A	on the chess game isn't it?
C	but you can see it's a strategy game someone who's good at that would make wipe the floor with me
A	yeah yeah
C	but I can wipe the floor with you because erm
A	I've never played it
C	like I say when I play against the computer even at normal the computer is not making mistakes
A	no yeah
C	I'm making mistakes as soon as I make mistakes it doesn't erm when I play against you or someone else who's not very experienced or less experienced than me erm you're making mistakes I'm capitalising on those mistakes or I
A	capitalising well on those mistakes
C	I've got my own plan as well
A	oh I don't know where my phone is actually
C	yes that's fine just switch it on
A	do you have cheese to go with beans on toast? yeah?
B	oh so are you doing it now then?
C	for him yes
B	oh I think
A	are you guys not eating then?
C	no we won't eat
A	okay I'll just make myself beans on toast then I mean it's not difficult is it?
C	I'd say well you've got an hour to to do it like
A	yeah I'll do some beans on toast oh we've got butter here where's your bread you got bread?
C	bread there yeah do you eat do you eat that kind of bread?
C	er we've got butter or marg
A	I'm not I'm really got fussy now but I'm starving
C	no
A	especially like
C	butter or marg cheese it's er
A	no I'd rather have butter than marg
C	yeah feel free er we've got extra mature cheese
A	margarine's not very good for you dad I would never go for go for real food rather than this stuff that they make which is like
C	mm
A	palm oil is not particularly good for you preservatives they put in I mean this is just butter
C	mm
A	it's just animal fats
C	mm
A	which is not really a problem would avoid margarine
C	mm
A	that will be my
C	right so you've got butter
A	opinion
C	there's some cheese there
A	they're like cheap oils like Canola oil's really bad for you
C	what oils?
A	that's my favourite cheese that cos they have erm like Canola oil it's not it's a fake they made it up
C	oh
A	do you now it stands for Canadian oil Canola?
C	right no I
A	it's just a made up thing and
C	I I've never heard of it
A	yeah Canola it's really big in Korea cos it's cheap Canola oil right have you got a toaster? toaster is here
C	yeah er
A	I mean for some reason there was a big thing about fat is bad don't eat too much butter but it's
C	yeah
A	but it's real food
A	that you're eating
C	go for the grill although it's more electricity it always tastes nicer doesn't it?
A	where's your beans?
C	er in in here
A	I'm quite hungry do you mind if I have three slices?
C	no I don't mind at all erm right put that under the grill
A	yeah we pretty much grew up on margarine but I'm not
A	no it's fine
C	it's still reasonably okay
A	would you I haven't had beans on toast in ages would do you have half a can on your toast?
C	that just have the full one

C	oh right
A	bit of egg or something like that
C	yeah
A	but erm
C	it's nice that you er you liked you know you actually like to er
A	I mean it's necessary to try and eat healthy isn't it?
C	oh yeah
A	mm
C	oh good well except oh oh
A	such a relief
C	have you got a student dentist?
A	er no just a NHS it's nice actually I tell you what change dentists if you've got that guy that I had before that I kept going to in
C	yeah
A	I found him uninformative
C	yeah
A	just uninterested and just
C	yeah
A	I didn't like him every time I went there he'd give me like last time I went he gave me five fillings and I had no problem with my teeth
C	yeah
A	they felt fine to me and then he drilled holes in five of my teeth filled them and for the next two months I had really bad mouth
C	yeah
A	and I kind of said this to the guy the guy was a young Indian guy
C	yeah
A	he was really friendly showed me how to floss pulled out a little thing with teeth
C	yeah
A	and like showed me how to do it
C	yeah
A	said I didn't need any fillings and it was all fine I much preferred him
C	oh right
A	if you're still with whoever that guy was
C	no I've been with them for donkey's years
A	I didn't like I don't like him
C	yeah
A	I don't trust him
C	no
A	he was erm
C	yeah
A	you see but
C	yes
A	because it's I didn't wanna go back and have five more I couldn't afford it
C	yeah no
A	for a start
C	yeah no er
A	need to wash my hands
C	do you get erm have you signed on with a doctor down there?
A	yeah I have we went down and had a and had to sign up it's nice as well I'm on
C	okay
A	I'll I'll show you the road it's a really pretty road it's nice nice medical centre erm
C	oh right
A	she has an implant maybe it's a bit
C	what's that so
A	bit new generation
C	yeah that that implant is erm for
A	contraceptive
C	contraception yeah
A	yeah but it's literally
C	yeah
A	and this is the second one she's had
C	right
A	and you have to have a bit of minor surgery to have it put in and removed
C	right
A	oh that's done already oh it's not on both sides
C	yeah you've got unless you want a French toast
A	erm
C	do you like that lightly done? you don't like it done a bit more toasted?
A	no no I'm not
C	I like it light brown not dark brown
A	yeah I mean that was light brown when I turned it
C	right let's get you there
A	so yeah we signed up with them and that was erm that was fine but
C	well yeah
A	there's a lot of paperwork in England
C	mm
A	there's a lot of computer says no you can't do that sorry it's against the rules against the regulations it's a little bit annoying
C	knives and forks
A	do you floss?
C	er I have started to
A	or have an electric toothbrush and
C	I've got an electric toothbrush but now I've got these kind of things that you put between your teeth as well
A	yeah
C	I've got my check up's on Tuesday my six month check up
A	I kind of want to get invest in an electric toothbrush
C	yeah
A	it's
C	yeah yeah
A	but yeah back to we were talking about healthy eating I've been eating the healthiest I've ever been in the last two years and I haven't needed any fillings when I've come back
C	yeah
A	and your teeth are strengthened by the nutrients that you you absorb
C	yeah I mean if you're not having a lot of sugar I was I've changed my breakfast I was having these erm porridge things porridge is different but the they're
A	plain oats though
A	yeah
C	each sachet's got six six erm spoonfuls of sugar in it
A	it's crazy isn't it?
C	yeah so
A	I mean I used to think Weetabix if you look at Weetabix there's quite a bit of sugar
C	yeah
A	and you're adding sugar to Weetabix
C	yeah
A	I had it today but there's already quite a bit of sugar in a Weetabix
C	already yeah yeah
A	I would say personally avoid cereal altogether
C	yeah
A	or you could blend it and make a smoothie but that's pretty much what
C	yeah
A	is
C	yeah what time do you have to get up to go to er?
A	how do I turn this off?
C	erm don't worry about that I'm gonna what time do you need to get up to go to erm to uni?
A	erm it changes it varies I in on Monday I'm in at eleven
C	oh I see yeah yeah not so early on a Monday
A	no on Tuesday and Wednesday I'm in at nine
C	right
A	and then on Friday I'm in at twelve
C	right so your uni's four days a week?
A	yeah for me it's three days a week for
C	oh she she gets an extra day
A	yeah
C	how comes hers is a day less?
A	she's doing one
C	oh I see
A	erm
C	so I suppose if if like the cleaning of the place is more of emphasis on her doing that seeing as she's got an extra day off or
A	yeah
C	an extra fifty-two days a
A	yeah
C	yeah you do your share but you think well er she is off an extra day okay she could be doing her studies but er
A	I could have done and I was tempted to but you know I thought you know what I'm here to do a degree so I didn't I didn't choose it was very tempted to do the easier option if I'd have just done the core modules
C	yeah
A	I could have just done two days a week I could have just done Monday Tuesday
C	yeah
A	and done three modules instead of four but they were timed so that two of them were on the same day
C	right
A	and I was very tempted cos that would've been a lovely schedule and I thought you know what? I'm here to do a degree I should do what I wanna do not just do an easier schedule I'm here to work
C	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	so now I'm doing four days rather than two
C	yeah will this make you more qualified than
A	well it make me sorry?
C	yeah
A	er no no no it would just we're just doing different modules that's all
C	right
A	as I said she's doing three graduate modules I'm doing two graduate modules and two undergraduate modules
C	right
A	so I've just split one of my graduates into two third year undergraduate modules but no it's the same credits we still come out with the same
C	right
A	the same degree
C	sorry?
A	do you know the name of the course I'm doing?
C	no
A	er applied linguistics
C	yeah I think you have said so yeah
A	yeah
C	that
A	applied linguistics so I'll come out with an MA it's kind of nice and what
C	yeah it it nullifies it
A	and once I get a masters from
C	yeah yeah
A	each one kind of is a bit of a step up
C	what's the plan you go back to mum's are you seeing
A	tomorrow yeah
C	might be seeing him tomorrow?
A	yeah I think erm auntie
C	oh right yeah
A	it's really busy for me coming home actually
C	yeah you were there's a lot of erm family reunion and kind of er
A	yeah
C	I suppose they had to transfer it over from the from the er from the state picking up the tabs there was too many bills erm too much debt to erm
A	oh but does does university really cost that much? you know what I mean?
C	well I
A	nine thousand pounds per person per per year
C	I don't honestly know to be fair
A	no there's no way it does
C	obviously they decided
A	how much are those lecturers being paid?
C	I don't know
A	lecturers are on about forty thousand pounds a year one lecturer sees how many students?
C	dunno
A	probably the average lecturer will probably teach between nine and twelve classes a week they will probably have contact with a hundred to a hundred and fifty students each paying nine thousand pounds a year and the lecturer's only getting forty grand for that well it doesn't add up it doesn't
C	no no
A	make any sense
C	sounds like a lot but cos it's never affected me so I've never bothered to look into it
A	and how is it that the entirety of Europe can pretty much do uni for free or at least very very cheap?
C	mm
A	I mean it doesn't really make any sense basically all it is is just greed we're just following the American model
C	well they don't thing is that they don't they don't think of the erm the rest of Europe have a welfare system like ours
A	no
C	which erm erm exceedingly erm irksome
A	mm
C	well
A	how can it cost that much to deport someone? how does that make any sense?
C	the legal process he
A	right so somebody's being paid a bit too much there
C	he resisted er and that's why yeah in in the end it cost them that's not including what he was erm claiming on benefits and stuff like that that's just the legal fees of his deportation of actually coming over a number of years so there was probably about four or five secretaries Theresa May was the successful one and tried to get him deported and he was like going through the all the different courts and that and getting it appealed and blah blah blah you know the Jordon court has found him innocent because the er a lot of the confessions were under torture and in a civilised society er you can't bring or use
A	I mean in a civilised society you shouldn't torture at all should you?
C	it is probably correct but to be honest you could get anyone to confess anything
A	yeah
C	if you're pulling their nails out so er with the absence of that evidence the courts er said there wasn't a strong enough case to and he was he was cleared but he can't come back here or else it would be an interesting case if if he suddenly turns up what are they going to do? and it
A	I mean
C	it's yeah but it's
A	how
C	well it's it's the process
A	how much in resources did it cost?
C	erm I don't know about resources all I know is the figure that they said the one point seven million that's a lot of money for one individual
A	yeah
C	but you know seeing his dad his mother was a musician and his dad was from Ghana in Africa well er they were trying to deport him in eighty-two and he was he was contesting that under if you've got an English ancestor and you can prove this then you don't get deported
A	mm
C	well his his grandfather the celebrity's great grandfather was English and his name was Yates
A	yeah
C	but the the
A	yeah
C	but you have the likes say Abu Qatada we've never had any links with er Ghana was part of the commonwealth
A	mm
C	Jordon's never been part of the Commonwealth
A	no
C	but they were allowed to come over here you know just a few years later er so that was a a you know how they the the rules suddenly changed but back to this guy and you know how you're lucky to be here his it turned out that his great grandfather was already married to an English woman and they had a couple of kids he was in the gold industry so the first he took them then his wife and that out in South Africa and then he went alone to the to to
A	mm
C	to find work er this was what he did gold mining he would never exist because he wouldn't have met his great grandmother out in Africa
A	no
C	and had but ironically this guy he had English ancestry from two both sides of his
A	so he's got quite a few ties
C	yeah
C	it's such a I mean it's like Oliver Cromwell er there was a vote going ahead and he he's you know this is well before the
A	yeah
C	if he'd have done that David and
A	it's weird to think that isn't it?
C	yes but and so you'll hear the other flukes that you'll hear like I said if I
A	not in the same shape
C	no not at all not in any way shape or form if you think about it you're not you're not your brother and that's a person directly related to you
A	yeah no you're right
C	not in any way shape or form would you be what you are
A	no you're right
C	you would you would er
A	doesn't bear thinking about it does it?
C	no you would have you would still have erm twenty-three sets of your mother's DNA and erm twenty and her mitochondria but you
A	yeah yeah
C	which is not er close at all
A	no true as I said it doesn't bear thinking about it
C	no
A	there are so many
C	so this
A	small things that would change the course of history
C	yeah so many things have to take place in in history for you or I to be here
A	or anyone
C	yeah so I said if I had just erm er not if your mother hadn't been as persistent as she was er you would not exist
A	no
C	and then there's another half of you which would be from me that wouldn't be you you'd have my twenty-three sets of my chromosomes but you wouldn't have my mitochondria er er and that wouldn't be your mother so it's
A	that's a bit strange
C	so you kind of thank your lucky stars
A	I mean you can say a bunch of things though couldn't you if the moon wasn't exactly that far away from the earth then we wouldn't have
C	I know it yes exactly yeah
C	yes so many things like I said you're if you're if if our great great great ten times ten grandfather was rejected by our great great times ten grandmother all those generations that that followed would not exist
A	no it's all very tentative and precarious
C	yes it is
A	mm
C	but they would be related it's like with
A	that's a bit weird
C	Oliver Cromwell
A	I mean we're all related anyway aren't we?
C	thirteenth Cromwell thirteenth generation which means that you've got about one two one two thousandths of the of the DNA which means there's loads of people out there walking around that are related to Cromwell as well but that
A	do you think we're related in any way and shape to somebody famous?
C	I've no idea without doing the family tree I want to get around to it at some time
A	yeah do do that
C	it'll be it'll be a project to do
A	yeah I'd be interested to know
C	yeah it will be a project to do there's a possibility your mum's side comes from erm possibly Spanish from my side possibly Jewish
A	yeah and Irish though
C	and Irish and Irish Irish and Jewish
A	quite a few
C	yeah Irish and Jewish for
A	and it was originally
C	yeah it'll be interesting to find
A	I am interested to know but at the same time I feel a kinship with all humans so I kind of purpose personally feel like we're all related so
C	you are er the Chinese tried to make out that erm they weren't descended from Homo Homo sapiens they had different they er it was a different species of Homo erectus that they were from unfortunately what they what shot that down in flames was that they took two hundred random DNA samples across China
A	and said no you're related to it
C	because there's a a defective gene from about seventy thousand years ago from a a woman which we all have erm and from Africa and every single one of those two hundred Chinese had that
A	yeah
C	which meant that there was no other strain they came from
A	and their descendants were from the same
C	they came from that mother was well that mother was the mother to all of us
A	yeah
C	it was a defective gene
A	it's crazy
C	blue eyes comes from anyone who's got blue eyes is related
A	what does sapien mean? Homo sapien?
C	don't know
A	cos I know er quite a few times I've read in linguistics books they're they are they argue that erm our language is one of our most defining features of what makes us human what separates us from all other creatures on this planet is our ability to communicate and what has well not communication and and language as separate
C	er yeah animals can communicate
A	yeah but they don't have language
C	they don't have the
A	so they they wanted to call our species Homo loquens would be the speaking man which would be the
C	oh right
A	the talking human
C	yeah
A	because I mean really it does separate us from everything doesn't it? it it
C	yeah
A	what defines us more than that?
C	yeah there were different species of human living at the same time
A	yeah
C	the Homo sapien was also living with about three or four other different species of Homo whatever
A	yeah I mean they've looked at erm the skull structure of you know Neanderthal Neanderthal man and
C	yeah
A	believe that they couldn't have spoken like we do simply because of the shape of their voice box
C	yeah
A	and the shape of everything we've developed an elongated larynx and pharynx which has allowed us to produce the sounds that we do
C	yeah
A	erm er they tried for ages to teach well not for ages but they tried for a little while to teach monkeys to speak and they realised well actually they can't they literally cannot make the consonants and vowels that we make
C	no cos they haven't got the
A	it's not possible with the voice box
C	they've got the wrong voice box
A	therefore they started to try to teach them sign language
C	there was cross I always
A	yeah I mean there has to be
C	because it I can see that because erm
A	you'd take their women wouldn't you?
C	you'd take their women you wouldn't just kill them they are for use you can rape you can or you can mate with them or or get them to do chores
A	so it's possible to interbreed then there we would've produced young
C	the well we have we have they reckon about two percent of our DNA is Neanderthal
A	is there any connection between intelligence and how much Neanderthal gene you have?
C	no but Neanderthals weren't that stupid they had tools er they erm add erm yeah they were just they were just as as er they were stronger than us and they were they were here in Europe before us they were er our colour where the people that the Homo sapiens that they encountered were black they come out of Africa
A	so is the defining feature then our ability to talk?
C	er it was basically erm erm passing things on and learning things
A	language
C	yeah
A	you need language
C	they yeah no they did have a language but not as sophisticated as they didn't
A	that's what I'm saying because their reduced to consonants it's
C	they didn't pass things on
A	yeah
C	they kept very much to themselves in in troops they didn't like oh I've developed something and I go out and I show someone else it's somewhere else they didn't do that
A	no
C	hence technologically they started to fall behind strong they were stronger than us
