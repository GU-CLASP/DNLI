A	so we're gonna talk about Brownies today cos what was your erm earlier question
B	was it is Brownies
A	hang on a minute
C	no I I was just reminding you that it's gonna be Brownies
A	yes I know it's Brownies today but
B	is Brownies illegal?
A	illegal? now why do you why were you asking? what's your issue with it?
B	erm because it's sexist and that's against the law
A	and why is it sexist?
B	cos they don't allow boys
A	cos they don't allow boys so it is an interesting issue actually isn't it?
B	mm
A	cos if it was the other way around people would be possibly up in arms and saying this is real sexism and
B	no
A	and the Brownies' website does promote it saying that girls prefer the fact that there are no boys but erm if you feel very strongly about it we could write a letter and make it public
B	right I'm going to ask some people erm who if they would prefer it if there were boys or not in Brownies?
A	you're going to ask the Brownies themselves?
B	yeah see if the Brownies
A	but to be honest with you it's irrelevant if they that's not a legitimate thing cos you can't have you know people in a workplace saying well I don't really want girls in there they have to allow girls don't they and boys in society? so it is in fact very sexist that Brownies doesn't allow boys
B	yeah
A	but I'm just saying if you wanna make an issue about it we could write an open letter and put it on Twitter or something to see what they might suggest I think in all I think perhaps most boys won't want to do Brownies but that's not the point if you wanted
B	there's barely any
C	no there's hardly any
A	but but if you want to join Brownies and do the activities that they do then perhaps you should be allowed
B	I may not want to but
A	yeah but I think you do don't you?
B	yeah I do but
A	mm
B	I just wanted I just wanted so
A	you to be yeah
B	yeah I just want boys to be allowed to join Brownies
A	I've yes but I think we could really only pursue it if you if you did actually personally want to do it because perhaps nobody wants to join Brownies perhaps no boy wants to join Brownies
B	I'll ask some of my class
A	or they've not really thought about it but I think if you made an issue about it then that other boys would start to think ooh actually yes I like the things that they do in Brownies stop doing that
B	yeah
A	you shouldn't have to to do it or join it as justification for getting them to change the rules I mean if you like you can just make a statement saying that it is that you feel it's sexist in fact if you want I can film you saying this and I can put it on Youtube if you prefer?
B	I think Twister would be better because
A	you think Twister? Twitter?
B	Twitter might be better
A	well I can also put Youtube stuff on Twitter but you'd prefer a letter?
B	yeah
A	so what what are your thoughts do you want to to do that?
B	if it really gets into my head and then I and then I probably will
A	cos I know you've been quite upset about it on and off since
B	although there is one thing
A	mm
B	that's a problem
A	mm
B	will you be able to afford it?
A	to do for you to do Brownies as well?
B	mm
A	I'd find a way of making it happen
C	also
A	you don't do diving any more
C	what do you do?
A	yeah yeah
B	chess
A	chess and football football
B	mm but
A	but chess doesn't cost me any money
B	like like out of school what do you do after school?
A	yeah
C	I do Brownies drama and ballet
A	yes
B	okay Brownies drama and ballet
C	BGB
A	oh yeah well you're not doing any drama lessons at the moment so but the question is do I mean we've talked about this before haven't we? in fact I saw something in a magazine and I took a photograph off today there's a senior army officer who joined the army as a man and then realised that she wants to become a woman
B	hey
A	so she's now become a woman erm because there are people that feel that they're born in the wrong body or there are mainly men it doesn't really work the other way around that er don't want to change sex but they do want to wear ladies' clothes
B	like David Walliams
A	like David Walliams yeah or there's Grayson Perry
C	the
A	the Grand Central boy? the boy in the dress?
C	yeah
A	yes that's right
B	there's also a film called The Boy in the Dress
A	ah erm yeah
B	The Boy in the Dress is basically a life story about David Walliams
A	well it sort of is and he he
B	well apparently they're gonna go kayaking and it's just seems like a lot
C	punting
B	punting
A	punting they're going to go punting
B	but it just seems like so but Brownies just seems like so much more fun than er Scouts is it?
A	yes I think you definitely would prefer Brownies to Scouts
B	yeah and to Beavers
A	yeah
B	I do not know the reasons why
A	yeah okay
B	that's why it had such a big impact in my life
A	well I don't want you to get upset about it this is just it's just a very complicated issue isn't it? there's absolutely no need to be worried if you're confused cos you're only nine and a half so er it's perfectly natural to not to not know how you feel isn't it? some some grown-ups don't quite know how they feel about these issues
B	mm
A	erm and we've we've sort of we have decided to be sisters together haven't we sometimes?
C	sisters
A	sisters together
A	that we could all dress up in dresses and go out and stuff
B	yeah
A	which would be lovely and you've got erm a dress well playsuit and you look lovely in it
A	yeah I just want you
B	because
A	to be happy and
A	so the whole kind of other sexual stuff is gonna come later but I still think we should make erm an issue about the Brownies thing
B	really?
A	because it is it is sexist and I think their argument on the website saying oh it's nice to have somewhere to go where there aren't any boys I've I personally find that quite offensive
B	yeah
A	it's rude isn't it?
B	I
A	because you'd never be able to say that of as a boy
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah if it if there was a boy saying oh I love this place there's absolutely no girls there
A	everyone would attack them wouldn't they? yeah
B	yeah everyone would be like oi that's against the law
A	yeah they'd say well they'd say it would be very
B	yeah
A	mm
B	just
A	I'll find out who the head of the Brownies is and I will write to them about it
C	do Brown Owl
A	no no of the entire well of the whole country
B	the queen?
C	well
A	the queen is not in charge of Brownies
C	well the person did tell you
A	the person did tell me? would you like to be a little bit more specific?
B	yeah
A	like the person told you that I was really good at Brownies remember? and she gave you a little phone call on the like a texty?
A	what? a little phone call little do you mean?
B	little phone
C	yes from Brownies
A	there is somebody not
C	I mean that she was the whole of the country
A	well we haven't met her
C	she texted you
A	nobody's texted me to say that you were brilliant
B	can we also complain to the people in the law so even so if Brownies doesn't do it then it might need to shut down because if it's sexist?
A	well I think that would be a bit harsh but I think we will start with a campaign where we even where we contact the Brownies' head directly and then if we're not happy with what they say then we'll go public on Twitter
B	yeah and if and then if we're still not happy loads of people are going oh no no no it's brilliant that there's loads of places there's finding a place where there's no boys and just girls then it then we might need to go to the head the people in the law
A	well yes which well that would cost money so it would be a bit tricky but they might decide that you could be an honorary Brownie in
B	yeah er I'll ask my friends if they want if they wouldn't mind if they became a Brownie
A	yeah that would be interesting take a poll
B	because I'd like to have some friends there
A	well you've got loads of friends you've got
B	yeah I think quite a few people have a crush on me
C	mm mm mm mm
B	it's possible
A	and you've got your sister
B	yeah
A	is that what you wanted to say?
C	mm
A	yes
B	but I do want some like friends that are boys cos it would be a bit awkward if there was
A	it wouldn't be awkward at all if you were the only boy
B	I have to do my promise night
A	well why would that be awkward? I could be there with you and hold your hand if you wanted?
B	no I was just wondering cos I'd like to do the dancing dancing dancing
A	can you just speak properly sorry?
C	what's for dessert?
