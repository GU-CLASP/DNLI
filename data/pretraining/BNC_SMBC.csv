A	Jewish?
B	Jewish Ottolenghi is because Ottolenghi is Jewish
A	I don't no I don't wanna look at this

B	okay
A	so oh
B	you didn't know?

B	yeah so
A	yeah it yeah Ottolenghi?
B	Ottolenghi yes
A	I thought he was Italian or Turkish
B	no he's
A	he's Jewish?
B	I thought he was Jewish I might be wrong
A	I thought he was Turkish or something
B	oh maybe he's Turkish but anyway he co he co-wrote it with a Jewish er author
A	oh
B	or er maybe native
A	okay
B	erm
A	oh
B	just
A	mm
B	ones
A	mm
B	I mean just just
A	mm I might take some pictures of that of the pages
B	oh yeah I mean you know I remember you know having
A	Tel Aviv?
B	yes about three or four years ago and that tasted they're absolutely gorgeous and they were just grilled
A	really?
B	cauliflower with some sort of a spicy sort of
A	mm
B	I mean just
A	mm
B	into something
B	just extraordinary
A	wow
B	and that's and that's that's you know you can do it here at home
A	yeah a lot of it is down to kind of
B	yeah
A	spices isn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah I have
B	do you have spices at home?
A	yeah I do I do and I have my Leith's Vegetarian Bible which I
B	mm
A	I quite like but unfortunately it doesn't have pictures
B	oh
A	so it's a bit kind of like you don't know what you're making or what to aim for
B	mm mm
A	and also some of the recipes are a bit seventies
B	oh
A	and then
B	you ought to try these try these recipes
A	I might
B	yeah especially the one the tomato recipe er for breakfast
A	tomato
B	tomato egg
A	and egg
B	just
A	spicy
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah I love Harissa
B	yeah so you you can either add Harissa or a Jewish version of Harissa
A	oh
B	which is erm
A	oh
B	and I made it at home
A	oh oh so it's spicy eggs?
B	it's it's spicy egg with tomatoes
A	so gonna have chilli eggs
B	yeah
A	mm sounds good
B	but you sort of poach eggs in tomato sauce
A	oh I see oh that sounds delicious
B	yes
A	that one
B	so
A	wow sounds like a good supper dish too
B	mm mm and
A	mm
B	er bulgur wheat? mm
A	mm no what's that?
B	it just kind of like a few recipes of aubergines
A	mm
B	I think they apparently you know they have more recipes er or aubergines than anything else
A	oh really? cos I love aubergine and I make the same aubergine thing
B	mm
A	all the time
B	well yeah you can give it a twist and you know
A	mm I need to do something else
B	yeah
A	with my aubergine cos I do love them that's the only thing I make I need to I'm I'm in a real food rut again
B	also you know I think you know I love this this Italian risotto recipe
A	oh
B	I used a New York chef and it was in this little leaflet that that was all about Parmigiana er Parmesan cheese
A	okay
B	so this you know er I think broccoli and peas are used
A	okay
B	but anyway oh this er risotto is the absolutely delicious
A	mm
B	not heavy quite
A	mm
B	light and fluffy
A	okay
B	and you can sort of
A	okay
A	mm
B	just
A	yeah
B	and add that as the base for the chicken stock
A	okay
B	so there's a bit more depth to the stock and then you know I also
A	oh
B	oh but I mean
A	mm
B	it's just I mean that doesn't even need any type of spice for any
A	mm
B	it's just so delicious
A	mm
B	just er broccoli and peas and and and and and the rice and you
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	the chicken stock and
A	mm
B	maybe a bit of wine and the Parmesan cheese but
A	mm
B	I don't I didn't use Parmesan cheese because you know
A	mm
B	but otherwise I think it could be really cheap because just green peas and broccoli
A	yeah I guess I guess it's getting the protein source in
B	yeah
A	pulses
B	yeah
A	I do get really bored
B	mm
A	of I get bored of them very quickly and then I and then I have I feel like I've got a dietary erm imbalance
B	yeah
A	mm well I I did these like they did these kind of quite good lentil patties which were really good I don't know how they did them but I'm trying to recreate them and I found a recipe in my Leith's cookbook but it just but it didn't have any egg in it so they didn't really bind together
B	oh I see
A	so I don't I don't know
B	so you deep fried?
A	you know I've only got a limited amount of kind of like brain for cooking it's just
B	yeah
A	quite a small piece of my brain and
B	I know me too
A	I it's just I can't sustain the interest in it
B	no
A	and and I'm so like
B	yeah
A	I'm not very good I mean I I did go through a thing of kind of planning and you know making my aubergine dish at the beginning of the week and doing like another vegetable dish even if it's just like green beans or something
B	mm
A	and cooking them and putting them in olive oil and
B	oh you know
A	garlic
B	Spanish paella by Ottolenghi?
A	yeah is it good?
B	I did that but saffron's really expensive but other than that it's a really great recipe
A	I'm not very eggy though
B	no no no no no no
A	I know eggs are good cos they're cheap protein
A	oh paella
B	paella but the
A	oh
B	the vegetarian paella
A	oh it's just rice and what? rice and vegetables
B	yeah but a beautiful
A	oh is it?
B	lots of vegetables
A	oh
B	red peppers er you know good artichokes
A	okay
B	and all of that and
A	Kalamata
B	Kalamata olives
A	yeah
B	onion soup
A	yeah I like food but I'm just a bit lazy about kind of making it
B	yeah
A	also cos it's been summer and I've just been eating salads
B	mm
A	with and then I make my vegetable dishes
B	mm
A	to have on the side and then I bought like that fish from Waitrose you know the kind of mackerel or
B	mm mm
A	I some a little bit of chicken or I just eat lentils so my diet is really boring
B	yeah
A	but I'm I'm only just buying stuff for lunch like
B	yeah
A	but I'm just like why am I seem to be constantly buying
B	yeah I know
A	food? I'm like why? why am I eating so much? why can't I just kind of like survive off less?
B	yeah if if you know yeah it
A	if you eat what?
B	eat
A	yeah it does yeah I guess so
B	or what you're cooking or
A	erm
B	because you know you you can think about what you've cooked and what you've eaten er
A	and it takes more time whereas
B	mm
A	if you're out you just buy something right? so you're
B	well you forget
A	not preparing stuff
B	yeah and you can forget about it you know when you come home like you
A	I just feel too much time is taken up with like buying food and like preparing it
B	yeah I feel the same sometimes
A	it's so boring
B	you I
A	for
B	or something at a Thai place
A	well for lunch is probably is if you just go and have
B	yeah
A	at a Pret
B	yeah even you know erm sometimes even er you know some readymade food from Waitrose or Marks and Spencer's you know cheap enough
A	maybe god I don't eat that stuff anymore when I was working in The Body Shop I lived off that stuff for three years
B	oh
A	I think that's why my stomach's in such a terrible state actually
B	oh no
A	cos I just ate prepared meals and I I was stressed out for three and a half years and and
B	were you there so long?
A	eh?
B	were you there for three and a half years?
A	yeah
B	oh that's such a long time
A	mm
B	you did so well
A	there's no point
B	to survive that
A	it's just pointless
B	really?
A	it's just kind of like yeah it's just pointless
B	but erm yeah yeah
A	that's just pointless
B	no
A	mm I think my expectations about life are just too high you know I kind of expect to do interesting work that's well paid I expect to have like a a kind of you know full social life these things just don't happen
B	yeah I
A	you
B	I I understand yeah well if you look from the advertising agency of course that's the norm isn't it? and er
A	I dunno
B	a kind of norm that lasts for you know a very brief period of time in your life
A	I think I I blame yoga for a lot of stuff
B	oh yes?
A	I think so cos like before I started doing yoga when I was drinking loads of alcohol and not doing yoga I was on a completely different level I was just on a
B	what do you mean level?
A	just completely different a day to day superficial like not thinking about anything
B	oh yeah
A	just going from one thing to the next without thinking about it and now unfortunately I think about everything and cos I'm sober all the time which to me is not a big deal because now I'm like this is second nature to me now and I don't you know I mean people say to me like my hairdresser was like oh I don't know how
B	there we go the hairdresser
B	I mean that I would not like the even take a pinch you
B	I mean that's just you know off an off a magazine that's not a a down-to-earth kind of advice it's unreal
A	no but I
B	unreal
A	but I I know but it's
B	no of course I don't I don't think most people do that
A	a lot of people do it
B	well yeah
A	a lot of people do it and it's good for stress relief you know it's stress relief isn't it? cos it's just escapism so
B	you mean alcohol?
A	yeah like any kind of substance you know mind altering
B	apparently women are er twice as much
A	oh
B	no so that's means that you know women perhaps are more open to to admit they're depressed as men just hide
A	get drunk
B	and er resort to drinking
A	yeah
B	so
B	yeah you don't wanna go there again it's like
A	it's not a solution is it? it's not gonna make me feel better
B	you overcame what's the point of going back?
A	yeah that's what I think
B	mm that's so defeatist yeah
A	that's what I think and even then I even I thought oh maybe you know like
B	yeah
B	substance abuse
A	addictions
A	I
B	er and you know
A	two addictions
A	these are my addictions and I feel
B	that's so healthy
A	I feel so guilty about the chewing gum I'm like why am I chewing this gum? please stop doing it
B	yeah I don't like chewing gum
A	it's so bad for you
B	yeah it is bad for you bad for your teeth
A	I don't think it's bad for your teeth it's good for your teeth
B	oh yeah if you eat sugar free
A	they're sugar free
B	mm
A	but it's bad for your erm
B	that er
A	yeah
B	anyway
A	shall we keep walking?
B	yeah
A	they're all dying now though
B	they're all dead you're right
A	that's cos of the season they're all dying I bought another little mint one
B	okay how long does it normally last?
A	not very long I
B	oh
A	I only bought it cos it was reduced in Waitrose like seventy P or something
B	yeah I'm
A	but I think it's not erm like all the leaves are really tiny now
B	mm
A	so I think it's not it doesn't wanna grow any more it knows
B	mm
A	that it's autumn and it's and it's time for sleeping
B	mm
