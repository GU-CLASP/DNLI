A	I went to Tesco's where I've gone for n number of years and probably been hundreds of times and I'm filling up as usual and suddenly instead of going to the car the petrol squirted came right up and then
B	yeah
A	yeah I was filling the car the petrol was the pump was working
B	yeah
A	the tank was filling as per normal but all of a sudden there was a huge pressure on my hand and the pump almost jumped out of the car you know where you put it and the petrol squirted up
B	yeah
A	and the petrol spurted up
B	gosh but had you filled your tank already or?
A	no I'd only got eleven pounds worth in and it takes forty pounds
B	gosh
A	so they were very I sort of staggered oh I staggered across the road and somebody said are you alright?  no I'm not no I can't see I couldn't see out of my left eye at all and I could hardly see out of my right eye
A	well they took me into a little place and they washed my eye out with water just with water because they hadn't got anything else at that time and I think I was shouting all the time ah ah oh ah you know and then they called for the ambulance
B	yes
A	no it was static
B	what?
A	it was static
B	so you went in the ambulance they sorted you out
A	yes and then they took me back to
B	oh is that where you'd come from?
A	no I
B	oh right okay
A	so that's my saga for the weekend I don't want any more thank you
A	oh I offered to pay for it and the lady on the till was going to take some money and the manager said oh no
B	she was going to take the money blimey
A	the lady on the till she didn't know any better
B	oh dear
A	she's just the the person who takes the money but the manager said no that's all so I got it erm
B	yeah
A	well
B	yeah
A	well you ask me that question and I always have to dive into my handbag and get my diary out because I
B	was there nothing very memorable then that's happened?
A	well it can't be can it?
B	oh you must've just
A	oh I've had a very good weekend
B	yeah?  did you win something on the Grand National or something?
A	no I didn't I went up to
B	oh yeah
A	on
B	was it good?
A	mm the people in the group were good and they had lots of talks lots of prayers lots of things
B	so what sort of form did it take? did you all go there?
A	well there were fifteen from around the country
B	yeah what whereabouts were they from?
A	er Norfolk London Wales erm one or two from Yorkshire and various places oh it were quite a
B	yeah
A	no there was no silence we talked and we even had a bar at night
B	right
A	yeah have you been to
B	I have yeah
A	have you been to the
B	yes
A	that's lovely that's where the bar is just a little cupboard and you go and help yourself
B	yeah
A	well I always
B	like the size of an airing cupboard maybe
A	airing airing cupboard plus size
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I wonder at
A	oh don't I got it changed you know
B	yeah did you check the date before you drunk it?
A	no I don't ever do that I opened a tin of oh I can't think what they were oh peaches the other day at home when I got home and it was two thousand and eight and it was perfect
B	peaches? oh yeah
A	oh I don't know don't ask me
B	where was it?
A	in the larder on the shelf
B	and it had been there since two
B	blimey
A	did I tell you a while ago I saw a programme on TV where they had found these Heinz erm Christmas puddings from Scott's Antarctic expedition? and they ate them all those sort of forty fifty years I think no sixty years later so two thousand and eight it is not going to
B	yeah
A	I don't look at dates
B	no I think people take them too seriously don't they?
A	I suppose it's good business if I'd have thrown that tin away I would have had to buy another one
B	yeah
A	I don't know I don't I don't go into those sort of things
B	yeah
A	well your nose generally tells you
B	yeah oh your eyes?
A	er no normally it's your nose you know if it's a tin and either you are pulling it or you are putting a a tin opener in there's a
B	yeah
A	and what have you been up to this week?
B	erm on Monday I
A	right
B	I didn't no I had to go somewhere else instead I had to go to Ripon with the music department to pick up this violin off the lady you know sort of near Morrisons so we went there
A	eurgh
B	you know I told you about
A	yes
B	yeah
A	tell me again I keep forgetting
B	well she her husband had died and she was full of this violin that he had I talked to her about how good it was and then we had to collect that off her because she was giving it to us
A	yes
B	no me and the music teachers so I was a bit disappointed about that really
A	why?
B	because I could've been at the trials and playing for the area and I'd have got a little thing for my blazer that says cricket on it still never mind
A	ah
B	it means I won't be able to play for but it doesn't bother me too much I mean I can play for clubs and schools and things so that doesn't matter I'm not too bothered about that but still we went to get the instrument from the lady in
A	mm
B	yeah there's a bit of that which I'm going to see for the orchestra which they can have and there's a music stand as well but I've left that with them a tuning fork as well that I've kept and a couple of bows as well which are handy I suppose because you can I've always been worried about one of my bows breaking
A	mm
B	yeah but that was really disappointing because our batsman didn't really get going at the start and the wicket was really hard to bowl off because it was just like a flat bit of carpet in the middle of a field where you're running in your spikes then all of a sudden half way through your run up there's like a carpet so you have to adapt to that so it's difficult to bowl on and plus they had this one person who looked about twenty-five he was
A	mm
B	no no they had to he had to be in year ten but he looked about twenty-five he just
A	well I wouldn't have thought that brute force would've enabled you to hit the ball yes when you've actually hit it
B	yeah well that's the thing yeah
A	yeah
B	and there were two of us who were bowling well but the other people didn't really and one of our players didn't turn up either so if we play them as our teacher said if we play them again we'd beat them every single time after that but it was just that first time they took us by surprise with it because just like the way they played and everything it was really different
A	well they had the advantage it was their field
B	well you don't really find that to be honest that's not really a
A	but you just said it was like a piece of carpet and you had to
B	yeah but they but they had to play off it as well so they had the difficulty
A	but if it was theirs they're used to it
B	no because we have a carpet at our school and we really hate it and it you you just can't get used to it I know what you mean but it's just impossible to get used to
A	it's not an actual carpet is it?
B	yeah it's a carpet
A	or is it grass? you know artificial
B	it's well it's like a carpet of green grass
A	artificial?
B	yeah so it's a carpet
A	mm mm
B	we've got one at our school and you never get used to it plus you're playing away all the time at proper pitches and with the club you playing on a proper pitch as well so
B	well any club that you play for they all have proper pitches
A	and which clubs do you play for?
B	I haven't really decided this year because there's some people wanted me to do one and some people wanted me to do the other
A	and so
B	yeah and I want to do one but then I feel sorry for the other so I'm just going to have to decide
A	you can't play for both?
B	no they play on the same night I'm afraid
A	oh well
B	and then today er we were discussing what had happened last night erm just having a laugh it was good fun though like the journey and scoring and everything because you get a lot of time when you're just sitting down when you're waiting for all the people to get back which is great fun
A	so you go on a bus? oh that's good and mum and dad pick you up at the end?
B	mm
A	that's what I mean and then your mum and dad have to come and pick you up
B	yeah that's it
A	right
B	there were other people saying if they wanted to drop me off but no I said it's alright well nobody it would they would have to be going out of their way really
B	twenty-four hours she was better by then I think it mustn't have been too bad so it must be twenty-four hours
A	right
B	yeah
A	you're not allowed to I once did that and they
B	that's a load of rubbish
A	yeah but then they are not always there that's what we had in libraries those sort of stools but
B	yeah
A	no this was the on offer yogurt in one of the sort of end aisles and it was right at the top and if it's a if it's a small thing I can get it down but if it's a big thing and I have one hand it might be
B	oh yeah
C	how many buns this size
A	so there you go
B	yeah
C	three sausages
A	no I haven't had any
unknown_female	two two
C	two?
A	talk about yesterday oh yes
C	two with extra
B	did you see the the election debate last night? the opposition one?
A	erm which one is that?
B	where it was all the opposition leaders I think it was clever
A	oh you mean it was the opposition as they are now?
B	yes
A	I thought you meant that personally you saw them as the opposition
B	no no no it's the opposition erm I I saw it erm I found it clever how the media had branded it because originally it was going to be a normal leaders debate but then Cameron and Clegg didn't want to be in it but with it being the BBC well Cameron didn't want to be in it with it being the BBC they have to give everyone their own fair share point of view so for them they had to call it the
A	mm
C	how many sausages would you like in how many buns?
B	er I'll do it myself
C	oh just to give me an idea two? three?
B	erm two yeah
C	two three?
B	two
C	two
A	but one bun please
C	are you sure?
A	and two sausages
C	right
B	yeah yeah that's that's me as well isn't it?
C	no you can have two buns you're a growing man
B	am I? okay I'll have two buns
C	I've got plenty of them
B	okay
A	you think we're alright then?
C	well
A	that's all I want
C	no I haven't got any would you like an egg and some chips?
A	oh yes
B	how long will it be?
C	er oh twenty minutes
B	okay can I just shut?
A	do you have you were you going to have a German exam?
B	er I had it a long time ago
A	no it's not that long ago
B	I told you all about it didn't I?
A	I don't remember
B	maybe you're thinking about that person who had a cold?
B	yeah
A	oh I spoke in German to her as best as best I could no don't don't you be just don't you start I know it is not as good as yours now you are miles ahead of me but I could still make her understand it might have been grammatically incorrect
B	oh gosh
A	as long as they understand it
B	yeah I mean if I said to you tomorrow I go museum to
B	no if I say in English tomorrow TV I watch you know what I mean wouldn't you? say an example in German if you said like they got words of it wrong
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	well er
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	it's Latin
B	yeah well we're preparing for our English language not English language German writing now as well so hopefully that will be done soon
A	so do you get your GCSE this year?
B	no they only do some of it you only do like thirty percent this year or something yeah that makes sense thirty percent
A	I think
B	yeah well he sort of has an advantage doesn't he so he's er is he doing all the year early within sort of being?
A	German something and something
B	Latin is it?
A	Latin
A	no it's inside school this time
B	so is it on curriculum now?
A	mm
B	blimey
A	mm
B	I think by the time it's exams next year
A	yes very good yes
B	well it takes a lot of the pressure away as well
A	yeah yes
B	and it makes it more you work harder as well because you know that this stuff actually counts
A	mm I mean we just had it all in one year
B	yeah
A	with biology?
B	yeah
A	do you think it's the long names for all the?
B	I think it's just like how there's so much stuff and it's all none of it's particularly inspiring that's on the curriculum nowadays it could it could be the best subject if you did what people like because everyone's interested in animals really aren't they? everybody loves animals people are interested in seeing plants and things but when you start talking about cells and bacteria I think that people don't really
A	no it's not no
B	I mean cells it doesn't really matter to be honest
A	but do you do human biology?
B	do a little bit of it but it's never the interesting subjects it's always about how nervous system works and things
A	I would think that would be quite useful
B	not really
A	well it
B	motor neurones synapses
A	no
B	and you've got to know how everything works
A	do they ever have these sort of multiple choice questions still?
B	they got rid of those about four years three or four years ago yeah
A	never really?
B	it's all written now and that's the problem because if you don't quite word your answer the way it's in the mark scheme then it's a big cross you can
A	that's wrong
B	there was a question suggest reasons and I put something I'd heard in the news that morning and obviously with it not being on the mark scheme I didn't get anything for it but I'm wise to that now I just stick to
A	that that's not education that's just sort of regurgitating
B	well at the this level they they don't really care if you think about the kind of people that write the exams or of that they'll all they'll say ah GCSE everyone does it sort of thing
A	well we didn't have
B	yeah yeah we get you get like on maths it's a bit better because you get method marks accuracy marks and result marks sort of thing
A	yes
B	yeah
A	so you know you could get the wrong answer but you could get two or three marks
B	yeah easy
A	mm
B	it's about the way you do it isn't it it's a bit like physics as well that out of all the sciences at this level physics is probably the easiest because they just give you the equation and it's just about putting the numbers into it
A	mm mm mm yes I understand
B	whereas if you're learning all sorts of things the revision guides are handy though because they tell you everything in there
A	the revision guides or guys?
B	yeah the they're like guides it is like a little book A4 size and it just
A	mm
B	we have to buy them for like three pound fifty or something
A	well that's not bad that's money well spent
B	that's not too bad
A	is it so far written down so that you can just rewrite it parrot fashion?
B	how do you mean?
A	well when I used to do exams especially with we got one on Greek and Turkish independence I think
B	is that history?
A	history yes and above my head when I'm thinking I can see my exercise book and I'm just writing the answers I'm just seeing it and copying down what I see in my mind
B	really?
A	yes and I can see when I turn over the page is that what you do?
B	no not at all I erm
A	different kind of do you remember things that you hear? cos I don't
B	yeah I can remember anything I'm quite good with facts
A	right I'm I see when it's written down it's it's not a good photographic memory but it's part of a photographic memory which it it helps at O level but it doesn't at A level you know you've got to start thinking
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	then it would get on that one yeah but on other ones if it was erm something I think it was something about statins or something
A	it would it would
B	give give two reasons why er some people don't want you to have them then they wanted to two hard facts and then I said that something about effectiveness that had come out in the news that morning that it wasn't too effective or something
A	right right
B	yeah yeah you get told your results
A	so you know
B	what what do you mean?
A	well how many marks you have got? how many percentages? you know if you've got a paper and it's going to count
B	oh yeah all the papers you do those at the end of year eleven so
A	yeah I know that but the things that you're doing now they count a certain percentage towards your final mark
B	not on the papers and things that's only little essays that you write controlled assessments only they count
A	okay
B	we've only done about we've only done two things that count so far three things
A	well what were you telling me you got a hundred percent in? was it German?
B	well I've got a hundred percent in everything so far
A	oh dear I don't think I'd bother go back to school if I was you
A	hang on what was the English? language or literature?
B	er language but it was more like literature really what we're doing now is more like language and then the other one was literature so
A	what is it? do you do a Shakespeare play?
B	we've done a we've done that already you only do one
A	what was it?
B	we did comparing Macbeth and Richard the third
A	ah Macbeth is my one of my favourites
B	I like Richard it's brilliant
A	I like Richard the second
B	oh yeah?  was that a play?
A	well hang on is it the one with
B	no that sounds that doesn't sound like what we're doing
A	right so it's it's Richard the second I'm talking about because we had that for ours where you could there was there was you could choose and about six of us chose Richard the second and I think the other one was a sort of flowery
B	yeah
A	no it wasn't Othello erm and it wasn't Midsummer Nights Dream
B	Romeo and Juliet?
A	it could've been but I know it didn't appeal to me so I did Richard the second
B	yeah
A	yes
B	it could be it's now is the winter of our discontent
A	of our discontent
B	but people think
A	made glorious by the son of York
B	people think that now is the winter of our discontent is about like erm how it's the winter and everything's dark when actually if you read the full bit it it is saying now is this winter of this discontent being made glorious by
A	no
B	and then that's a pun sun like the sunlight as the sun but it's the son of York so that's one pun there's loads of other ones as well
A	yes
B	we only do one but it counts as twenty-five percent so that's a whole quarter done already
A	well hang on did you not do them in your
B	yeah
A	did you not do a
B	no
A	because we did As You Like It
B	no
A	yeah
B	I've seen As You Like It I'd like to see Richard though because it's so like
A	I think it's good if you can see the one you're actually studying
B	yeah if you if you know the story of it yeah
A	mm
B	we did a little bit of Twelfth Night last year as well which is quite fun
A	brilliant
B	did he?
A	I can remember
B	oh that's in Twelfth Night
A	that's in
A	pardon?
B	there's one called
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well that means it's got to be succinct you've got to get
B	yeah we're only allowed four sides er four to six sides most of us did six sides
A	well I don't think that that's very fair because a smaller writer can get so much more
B	ah no no  that that was a guideline it wasn't really size of writing sort of thing if you'd written big then she'd of understood if you've gone over a bit more it was words really as a guide
A	it was it was a word count in an undergraduate essay you are never allowed more than two thousand words I think I'm not sure but at one time it was that it was eight sides in handwriting
B	yeah
A	it must've changed it must have how do you youngsters manage to spell things correctly when they're using text speak all the time?
B	well
A	really?
B	yeah so nowadays
A	very very good because the phone I've got when I text your mum it's always you know text speak as much as I can manage
B	yeah
A	well if you've got that little keyboard
B	just with your finger like just a little keyboard yeah
A	mm mm whereas you know you've got to with my twelve year old phone
B	yeah
A	I still use it
B	yeah I know someone I know a lot of people who still use sort of ones with er one two three number layout
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	and you put number four for for when you're saying for this for that and
B	yeah
A	no
B	you know if you go I'm so tired they put loads of Os after it you know what I mean?  have you come across that before?
A	no
B	ah well some people do that if you put like if you want to show that you're screaming like ah you've got a load of As and loads of Rs Gs and Hs
A	ah I would put A A A no just put ah
B	because no if you it's like you're pretending to scream that sort of that's what you call an over
B	over
A	yes
B	yeah it's softening it
A	mm
B	and then you get the brevity measure brevity techniques which is where you keep things short like instead of because
A	yes
B	that's not that's not so common nowadays it was though before
A	oh I'm getting old you are making me feel old ah
A	laugh out oh
B	yeah that's become a word really so people still use that as a word as in that's funny but not funny in a
A	I didn't know that laugh out loud
B	if something's if you want to show that you're laughing you can't laugh through a text message so you put a ha or a lol or a
A	no
B	yeah
A	yes
B	that was the problem with when David Cameron was sending text messages to Rebekah Brooks remember in the phone hacking scandal he put a lol thinking it was lots of love but it it turns out to be laugh out loud
A	right
B	but he thought it meant
B	well we will have to go through now so
