B	er yeah that's fine
A	mm
B	no? Okay

A	oh sweetheart
B	well no obviously for your birthday
A	we'll all go out and share it
B	we'll no we'll
A	that's fine
B	that's not a problem
A	mm
B	quiet dinner
A	mhm
B	it's her birthday
A	oh I've heard about them
B	it's infamous
A	oh dear
B	it's supposed to be really fun
B	my colleague
A	mm
B	and she loved it
A	mhm
B	you know the people up there
A	sounds good
B	are quite really burlesque but she went as a sailor's girl
A	mm
B	all kinds of stuff
A	that sounds good
B	so I'm quite looking forward to that
A	no it does sound good
B	Nicky and I are gonna meet for costumes for next Saturday during the day
B	mm
A	oh that'll be fun
B	mm
A	oh
B	we'll see
A	mm
B	mm
A	oh that's okay you er the thing is you should also speak to each other because
B	oh I'm sure he's gone in to dad's cos then he would have said oh
A	yeah
B	where are you taking the car?
A	you see
B	I would've said mum's and he would've said well I wanna come with you
A	you see
B	mm
A	when he decides to go
B	mm
A	he won't think ahead
B	no I had no idea
A	no I know
B	never knew he was here
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's just annoying
B	mm
A	whatever
B	or his bike
A	mm
B	mm mm mm
A	nice this cheese isn't it?
B	mm
A	I was just peckish when I came in
B	mm
A	er
B	you got the other Jane Smiley did you?
A	sorry?
B	you got that Jane Smiley?
A	I did cos it's a much better copy
B	mm
A	it's actually really nice
B	hmm
A	so I thought I'd charity shop that one
B	no
A	but if you wanna read it first that's fine
B	mm
A	it was recommended
B	okay
A	mm
B	Cos it
A	mm
B	oh okay
A	and still go in and take books
B	but then you pay more I suppose
A	mm
B	and the idea being that you don't clog up your house with more books
A	yeah exactly
B	so
A	and it's a good way of yeah
B	mm
A	anyway
B	mm
A	mm
B	was it run by people that you know?
A	no
B	mm
A	um yeah
B	did they go to the um Strauss thing yesterday? Strauss-Kahn
A	um
A	I don't know whether Jenny did
B	mm
A	but she wasn't so
B	I thought he just left it out because he was coming back later
A	well that's what he does but I would've put it back
A	you know but anyway
B	mm
A	no I mean he would've left the whole thing so
B	mm
A	but we do have to sit here in the evening so
B	how did it go with the woman yesterday? He wasn't very talkative when I tried to ask him
A	no he wouldn't be
B	oh
A	it was a different woman
B	mhm
A	it's quite difficult talking it over
B	sure
A	I mean it's it's quite a difficult thing for all of us to do
B	mm
A	but at the end the things she was saying  she was saying  oh you know I I need to speak to my superiors and I need to do this I need to do that
B	oh right
A	but she didn't er she didn't just say er clearly you don't qualify
B	mm
A	I dunno I just got the impression that
B	okay
A	so I got everything across
B	it's not her final sign off
A	say so
B	Good
A	so
B	okay
A	er um well we'll just have to wait and see
B	and was she talkative about this sort of declassifying of his condition? Cos
A	we didn't mention that
B	as opposed to
A	mm
B	thought
A	that is a very kind of unresolved question
B	well yeah
A	thing is he
B	well clearly
A	the question is
B	the fact that he has been for the last five er eight years
A	well exactly
B	whatever it is
A	um she um I mean as far as I can tell talking to Dido er sorry Dodi who's also a social worker
B	mhm
A	and I spoke to the Autistic Society as well
B	mm
A	um
B	right
A	but the thing is it's just a question of which department? You know cos each department has its own funding
B	yeah
A	you know same in social services
B	mm
A	um and er
B	mm
A	if if they er as a department as a learning disability department won't fund things then another department should
B	mhm
A	but we'll see
B	no
A	so I think that's what we have to talk about when she comes back to us
B	right
A	no
B	mm
A	no cos obviously she passes things you know she then has to sort of take it to the next level and speak to them about it
B	mm
A	it's very bureaucratic
B	yeah of course
A	well it does
B	yeah
A	it is
B	you'd think it'd be more uniform
A	you would think so
B	mm mm
A	and the good thing is I mean she did say this actually
B	mm
A	well it's ESA now but anyway
B	mm
A	and that's a national award obviously
B	yeah
A	local
B	yeah
A	um when she heard that he got that she said oh that's good
B	if he's seen as needing that
A	needing that then that will help his
B	mm
A	claim I think
B	so is he still getting that even though he's living with dad?
A	mm
B	yeah? Right
A	yeah because it's his entitlement
B	right
A	no but what they what they're doing and she talked about this and I think this is new
B	mm
A	their funding package is
B	mm
A	you know how many hours? How much money? How many this that and the other?
B	mm
A	they ask people to contribute towards it
B	mm
A	which I think er fair enough
B	yeah
A	but not many disabled people are in that position so
B	mhm
A	um
B	mm
A	well that's fine
B	mm
A	and if if he had to contribute some of his I mean it's tough but especially while he's living at dad's it wouldn't be as bad
B	mm
A	don't have any money
B	no
A	it could be that you know on that basis that you know he won't have to make a contribution
B	mm
A	scenario
B	no
A	mm
B	sort of raise your hopes in that way
A	I mean there's nothing definite
B	no of course
A	because they can easily do that but
B	yeah
A	it just made me feel that you know she thought it was
B	well that's encouraging
A	we'll see  we'll see
B	yeah
A	it is
B	yeah
A	he can't do that though
B	positive attitude
A	he doesn't have a positive attitude
B	I know it's flippant for me to say that
A	no no no
B	and I I know it's
A	no
B	probably I'm not being able to understand his position
A	the thing is
B	necessarily might not be there
A	he can't  he can't the the  the problem has always been with trying to get him something to do job course whatever is the fact that he can't imagine what it's gonna be like if he hasn't done it
B	mm
A	the things he has done he hasn't liked
B	mm
A	worked out
B	yeah
A	that's it
B	mm
A	he's also um you know he's in this state of mind where he will think negatively about anything
B	Cocky
A	not er no I wouldn't have said that
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah
A	I think
B	well we're probably the the only ones he is
A	oh yeah
B	comfortable around
A	absolutely
B	mm
A	and that always makes a difference
B	yeah
A	um
B	and er that's that's his not being able to imagine something you know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	or anywhere where er it's the public
B	yeah I know
A	so er it's absolutely the wrong thing
B	yeah
A	and I think the same with the
B	and it was one on one
A	yeah
B	rather than you know a big group
A	no I mean she was talking about things you know um there are colleges and there are courses in things like horticulture and not that he's you know particularly interested
B	but even if he just became an odd job man
A	working with things
B	do you know what I mean? Like you know there's lots of people
A	I know
B	in the  in the  industry
A	mm
B	locally
A	I know
B	who just take on lads
A	mm
B	and he
A	mm
B	and that means you'd be able to get a more reputable job
A	mm
B	on a building site
A	mm
B	um stability
A	yeah but
B	opportunities like that around
A	but if
B	yeah
A	it probably suits him for the time being
B	well I mean
A	A lot  a lot  of people drift like that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I think you know given that he's got a criminal record as well I think it
A	mhm
B	it's better to find something that you can do
A	mm
B	that's stable in the short-term
B	then er don't complain about it
A	mm
B	which I can't really cope with
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but I do know that a lot of that is because he doesn't know
B	yeah
A	so we're working on it
B	it's yeah I know I'm tut it is hard cos I you I can't empathize in that way
A	mm
B	given everything that he's already been through with drugs
A	I think it helps
B	easy for him to talk
A	I think it's helpful
B	to you about it because you've you've got more of an experience in that
A	mm
B	area
A	mm
B	but I suppose all you can do is really sort of be there for the person
A	mm
B	and that's what you try and do
A	well absolutely
B	in the short-term but
A	no but er but of course it
B	that's the worry
A	it does
B	yeah
A	and and I it's it's not just that
B	yeah
A	whereas he was happy at sort of nineteen to drift
B	Cos you don't see the future
A	at twenty-six he's not
B	yeah
A	at nineteen you think nothing's important and you can just drift along for
B	mm
A	but he's thinking now that that's not good enough
B	mm
A	well good for him for for realizing it
B	mm
A	but it is you know what you do
B	yeah
A	anyway he seemed alright
B	was he?
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	pretty much
B	so did you leave together at the same time?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah I'm annoyed
A	yeah
B	although I don't
A	well that's fine
B	mm
A	or he'll wait there
B	yeah give him a ring
A	I'll give him a ring
B	because they don't know that I'm here
A	oh right
B	are you back? Can I take the car? Because I thought
A	mm
B	I didn't realize
A	so what's
B	what to feed him with?
A	what to do about food for him
B	yeah
A	no he's not
B	I thought that's his
A	I thought he liked curry
B	well I think he used to
A	I think he probably has as well
B	so er that could be why
A	yeah
B	mm
B	if you must
A	um
B	where is he?
A	er he was with
B	oh
A	um and he's gonna come back
B	mm
A	that's fine
B	hmm
A	oh as long as he's alright
B	yeah
A	wasn't it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's quite graphic
A	yeah
B	forty-five staples
A	mm
B	pin her back together
A	mm
B	horrific
A	well that was I think two thousand and seven she had that
B	right
A	was it seven? Or was it nine? No two thousand and seven
B	yeah but
A	that's right
B	right
A	that was right
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but it's but he's very good at capturing somebody
B	mm
A	he's very good at that
B	he's sort of painting her quite accurately? Yeah
A	well it's
B	well I suppose he would wouldn't he because he's
A	I know but
B	knows her best
A	but sometimes you you can't I mean I think it takes a a good writer to do that
B	mm
A	complete
A	absolutely spot on
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	so yeah I thought it was
B	it was very moving
A	er er as always
B	yeah
A	without going too far
B	yeah
A	in either direction to make it really awful
B	yeah
A	so
B	absolutely
A	I think he's he's got a very good touch like that
B	mm
A	and I can always hear his voice in his writing as well
B	mm
A	you know  you know  that that's what a lot of writers have a problem with is finding their authorial voice
B	mm
A	she does lose it
B	mm
A	I can hear her saying what she's writing
B	mm
A	sometimes she loses it
B	well I suppose some isn't some of their stuff still
A	no
B	yeah
A	or that she's made him throw out
B	yeah yeah
A	but the stuff that I have read
B	mm
A	it's accurate
B	yeah
A	because it's it's completely natural
B	mm
A	he he captured
B	yeah
A	but you know he painted himself as well
B	yeah
A	and very accurately and sort of
B	he was very honest about himself
A	warts and all
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	both er with the bureaucracy surrounding you know people
A	and with
B	and with
A	yeah
B	so he was very honest about that and I
A	I mean I think that's why it works
B	though that's why people respond to it
A	and
B	mm
A	how exactly how he speaks about people
B	and I suppose and that's what makes him different to a er to other well I don't read a lot of biographies but
A	mm
B	because usually in a biography it's just the one person that you're
A	yeah
B	writing about
A	yeah exactly
B	but I suppose but maybe that's to do with you know normally you'd be writing a biography about a famous person
A	possibly
B	or someone well known
A	mm
B	so you might only want to tell about them
A	yeah
B	you wouldn't wanna put yourself in it
A	but I think no that's right
B	but it works this way
A	yeah
B	mm
A	which is why he's done it
B	yeah
A	it does  it does
B	yeah I do want to
A	mm
B	so yeah when you get that back from
A	no
B	oh yeah
A	I must get that back as well
B	mm
A	what am I looking at? Monday
B	hmm?
A	nothing on then
B	hmm? mm
A	within about a week
A	so fast
B	mm
A	think it's the one upstairs
B	oh is it?
A	I think so
B	they've done a lot of work to it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	no
B	I didn't recognize the estate agent sign out front
A	okay
B	and just type in your postcode
A	yep
B	what do you reckon? About one eight one ninety? What did you pay? You paid one eight five?
A	one no one eighty for this
B	one eighty
A	yeah it's oh no
B	hmm?
A	it says ground floor
B	oh maybe the family want to move
A	I know
B	but they spent
A	they've spent a lot of money on it
B	mm
A	and when I moved in
B	really?
A	and he said you know I'm sure he said it had gone up
B	mm
A	so that's that's that's interesting
B	maybe that's the market
A	yes
B	oh really?
A	yep
B	maybe it's the one next to it
A	but the picture
B	can you tell from the picture outside?
A	no this oh right this is
B	that's not
A	no
B	it's M somebody beginning with M?
A	so this is another one
B	so
A	but it is okay so it's a downstairs one and they're saying it needs some updating
B	so where is it? Can you not tell?
A	oh no wait a minute I can see it
B	round the other side
A	that's round the other side
B	can I see the photo? Oh right
A	the garden is right okay I'm just reading the details
B	mm
A	um that's the only one that's coming up when you do a search
B	oh that's interesting
A	no
B	Cos of the estate agent's thing out the front
A	um
B	yeah
A	wait a minute
B	mm
A	so presumably it's number eleven isn't it?
B	mm
A	oh yeah
B	there's two more
A	okay
B	so it'd be seven and nine maybe? Seven?
A	so it must be seven
B	Cos there's three houses on the way in isn't there
A	that's true
B	one three and five
A	that's right
A	yeah
B	oh on Rightmove
A	wait a minute
B	hmm
A	yes
B	it wasn't one I recognized
A	no nor me
B	mm
A	I'm gonna go and have a look
A	Cos it's I can't find it anywhere
B	it's a funny time of day to be going out
A	it is isn't it
B	well I hope they don't wake you up when they come back
A	well I don't hear it quite so much as
B	oh the front the main bedroom's
A	Cos it's the front door
B	at the front is it? Oh the front door
A	well no it's the front door
B	oh right
A	Cos you the they just they slam it and it's just not necessary to do that
B	mm
A	but they do
B	some people are just really inconsiderate
A	yes
B	so what was the sign?
B	ah
A	never heard of them
B	no
A	Cos you if it they if they've put a sold sticker on it it won't show the price
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	sold for
A	but there's a a delay isn't there
B	mm
A	mhm
B	huh
A	nine nine five
B	blimey
A	now
B	mm
A	going up to the sort of two hundred mark
B	really?
A	that's what it would
B	mm
A	thing
B	mm
A	so
B	I wonder how much
A	they did do a lot of work to it
B	they did  they did  I think they put in a new kitchen didn't they
A	I think they did
B	mm
A	although they've got a rotten front door
B	yeah
A	oh the kitchen's weird
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	that is weird isn't it
B	yeah
A	dunno
B	urgh
A	but they've put these
B	I wouldn't spend two hundred thousand on it
A	floors in
B	mm
A	you know these wooden floors
B	mm
A	well it's not real wood
B	no
A	flooring
B	yeah
A	I think that's all fairly new
B	I wouldn't have said
A	the suite doesn't look it
B	that toilet doesn't look very new
A	no it doesn't does it
B	mm
A	it looks actually much more cramped
B	it does look more cramped
A	oh no
B	they've only got half the window
A	oh that's strange isn't it
B	mm
A	they knocked you know whether there was a door and there was like a half window
B	mm
A	nanny
B	mm
A	and grandad's?
B	mm
A	like that
B	yeah
A	and they actually took all of this out to put to make it all glass
B	yep
A	that side they've got French windows
B	yep
A	I mean they're all different
B	yeah
A	but they're all full length
B	mm
A	so that's weird that it's not
B	yeah
A	no
B	time aren't they
A	and that's weird as well
B	what thing? Oh yeah you said
A	when you walk up
B	you thought you'd seen a TV
A	and you can see it on that wall there
B	well then maybe that's a
A	mm
B	and watch movies on that
A	would they do that?
B	well I know um a friend of mine used to do that
A	Strange
B	he used to get a projector
A	and this is very very peculiar
B	yeah
A	would you have your sofa there looking at the wall?
B	no
A	that's what they've done
B	yeah it
A	it's weird
B	it's very strange
A	of course you would
B	so their priority is the TV not the life and nature outside
A	and their  and their  charming urgh
B	it's disgusting isn't it
B	it's so tacky
A	people are oh dear
B	yeah
A	yeah cos when you walk up here you can see through that window there
B	yeah
A	see
B	mm
A	er and that's that there
B	yeah
A	so there's a window there
B	mm
A	it's weird isn't it
B	it's a really strange set-up
A	that's very odd
B	if if you'd had bookcase or something on that wall I could understand it
A	yeah
B	don't have anywhere else to put bookcases
A	yeah
B	but why would you have your sofas there
A	no wait a minute
B	oh right
A	right
B	right
A	that's the eighty-two or whatever it is
B	oh well now now we understand
A	so okay so now this right
B	now we understand why there's no door
A	okay
B	right
A	so this is the one now this is going for two hundred and er they haven't or near enough
B	and they haven't got a garden
A	and they haven't got a garden
B	and it's not very nice
A	and it's not very nice
B	mm
A	well er I mean they've got the laminate floors
B	it's really odd
A	so that's why they've got their
B	you've got more square
A	that's why they've got
B	yeah
A	because you haven't got the that bit of corridor to the front door
B	mm
A	you haven't got that
B	mm
A	no
B	and there's no garden
A	so it must be
B	you've got a massive garden
A	that must put another ten thousand on
B	yeah
A	at least
B	if you took five off for replacing carpets and stuff
A	the the downstairs one would always go for more
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you've got the biggest garden on the block so
A	absolutely
B	yeah but already it's much nicer than it was
A	it is
B	mm
A	that's why this looks odd
B	yeah
A	Cos it's actually upstairs
B	now we understand
A	right
B	so um so that's a nice to have a ballpark
A	and actually
A	and where's the boiler?
B	might be in the airing cupboard still
A	mm
B	mm
A	Cos
B	mm
A	it's same as mine
B	mm
A	I can't remember if he's got a thing there or not
A	but then we have got that huge cupboard under the stairs which he hasn't got cos that's the stairs
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	there's room for one more set of cupboards or another appliance
B	right
A	which I haven't got
B	okay
A	Cos you imagine if you didn't need to get to the front door
B	mm
A	you've got that
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	oh I er God yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's the upstairs one
B	wow
A	well it is encouraging
B	yeah it must be really old
A	look at that
B	Good grief
A	well that's good for me
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah because do you wanna have a look at dad's postcode because
A	oh yeah
B	Cos they've just put it up
A	that's interesting
B	his postcode is
A	hold on
B	oh
A	I was gonna show you this one
A	so here's the downstairs
B	oh that's interesting
A	and I think that's dodgy
B	because it's really
A	but look the garden is I mean it's big but it's really
B	it's big
A	it's actually
B	unless you had a family
A	it's actually not that big
B	mm
A	really in a bad way
B	but er you know first time buyers might think that that's really nice
A	it's very it's a good investment
B	mm
A	it is a good
B	if then if you could get a ten percent mortgage that's doable isn't it
A	and people  and people  would
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	correct me if I'm wrong
A	yeah
B	ten percent mortgage
A	mm
B	then you just need ten just you've gotta have ten thousand
A	yeah
B	and then you've probably gotta have five each
A	mm
B	to do it up
A	but that's interesting isn't it
B	but it'd be worth twenty-five grand more when you've done it
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	to get somebody to buy it
B	mm
A	it depends if you think you know if you think you can do it and not
B	mm
A	then you're still gonna make some profit on it
B	you've got a margin
A	yeah
B	mm
A	right
B	one X W
A	yep
B	is it
A	it is
B	yeah there's dad's front door
A	so what are they saying for it?
B	hers is this one
A	one eight nine five
B	ah now what did dad? Dad's was on the
A	how's she's lived in it for a long time
B	yeah
A	so it will need well no it's it looks alright
B	but it  but it  has er it's still got the ceiling heating
A	yeah
B	I think
A	I think that's the reason that they came down
B	mm
A	because the room itself looks fine
B	it's fine
A	looks much nicer
B	it's all bare
A	cream
B	you know it's all
A	funny they're the same units aren't they
B	yeah
A	they're obviously the original ones
B	and but this is the old tiny half washing machine thing
A	oh
B	so you'd have to get rid of that
A	yeah
B	er they're big though
A	they are
B	is really big
A	yeah
B	cupboard
A	that's not bad at all is it
B	but you'd have to knock them down on the heating
A	yeah
B	so I dunno
A	mm
B	given the state of the market
A	well they've only just put it on haven't they so
B	it was last end of last week
A	mm
B	so we'll see
A	mm
B	so he said knock it down by five
A	well that's fine
B	so well er exactly
A	no
B	yeah
A	well it's nice to know that this is worth that though
B	yeah
A	no
B	be here
A	exactly
B	you dunno what I mean you dunno what you will have done to it in that time so
A	no but you
B	yeah
A	value
B	yeah
A	um that's
B	absolutely
A	that's quite a um an important point
B	well I guess unless you're ruining it
A	absolutely
B	mm
A	unless it was in Arbury or somewhere
B	well yeah
A	there's too many people living there
B	just trying to get on the property ladder just seems impossible
A	it does
B	but there are still part buy schemes
A	there are
B	you know
A	the there absolutely are
B	half the deposit
A	and you can I mean er you know live somewhere er where it's not quite so expensive and you know
B	yeah
A	I mean you be careful about where you
B	you you get a lot more for your money in places like
A	yeah
B	I mean half the
A	do they?
B	they all live in
B	you know you walk down the street and you just see everyone from work
B	but
A	yeah
B	it's only fifteen minutes
A	no
B	it's not an ugly town
A	no
B	yeah
A	so that's not so bad
B	it's just um even to buy somewhere like that
A	yeah
B	and even if it was a part buy
A	yeah
B	which actually now is is completely unfeasible
A	mm
B	like at the beginning of the year I thought God how am I gonna do this? And I was really worried
A	mm
B	I have been doing this recording as a way of
A	yeah
B	clearing my debts
A	mm
B	and it's making me feel more confident about
A	Good
B	having probably from about April onwards when I get the second payment for this um
A	oh right
B	um
A	oh good
B	from zero
A	okay
B	so every month I can be putting like
A	you can put some
B	hundred and fifty a
A	I think that's a good idea
B	little little catchy monkey
A	yeah
B	but at least that means that there's a safety net there
A	no
B	so
A	absolutely
B	depending on you know what I wanna do whether I do wanna try and work abroad for a little while and
A	yeah
B	at least it means that I feel like
A	you have
B	there were opportunities and there's
A	yes
B	a chance to do something
A	exactly
B	I don't know
A	I mean you don't have to tie yourself down
B	well no I mean er that's the thing
A	yes but
B	I'd like a little house
A	but a mortgage
B	I'd like somewhere that I can make my own
A	is like
B	I know
A	especially the size that they are
B	but the thing is
A	I can't imagine
B	you you just rent the I mean I know that some of them don't let you rent them out in the first five years or whatever it is but if you were to buy a house
A	do they?
B	at least then
A	mm
B	in the to in the part buy you can't rent it out
A	right
B	so maybe you could do it to a mate or something
A	right
B	um
A	mm
B	you would just rent your flat out
A	yeah
B	or your house
A	absolutely
B	and then that's not a weight
A	that's true
B	back home
A	yeah
B	and you're off working somewhere else and someone's paying your mortgage
A	that's very true
B	so it just means that you do have that security
A	yeah
B	but it
A	that's true
B	but really it's a massive massive problem
A	it's a huge thing
B	starting a massive commitment
A	yeah
B	you know if I was going in with a friend or boyfriend
A	mm
B	you you know
A	mm
B	you're you're in a better position
A	well you
B	well
A	no
B	but also at the same time this year I'm thirty
A	mm
B	I don't wanna live in a house share
A	no I know
B	I wanna place to make my own
A	I know  I know
B	so it's hard
A	mm
B	I don't know what the best thing to do is
A	mm
B	at least then I can start thinking about what it is I want
A	yeah
B	to do
A	you'd think you could huh you'd think it would be possible to buy a little flat somewhere without killing yourself wouldn't you? But
B	it's just impossible
A	it's it's oh it's unbelievable
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	yep
A	mm
B	at least then you have money it's
A	it is
B	mm
A	from now on
B	Cos obviously banks are worried about lending to people
A	yeah
B	quite rightly
A	but they were
B	money to people who couldn't repay and then
A	well yeah but it's their fault
B	kicking them out on the street
A	and it means people like you who you know
B	I'm a sensible person
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	and you haven't been saving since you were sixteen
A	mm
B	just think the people that I know that own houses well their parents gave them money
A	I know
B	somewhere
A	well that's true
B	that's
A	she inherited money
B	mm
A	um that's that's exactly what happened with her
B	I mean
A	well it's nice to have family to leave it to you but
B	yeah
A	you know
B	well you know
A	yeah
B	I'll just have to wait and see what happens really
A	no I wouldn't worry about it
B	I can't afford to rent a place on my own
A	but rent but rents are so high
B	if it was  if it was  I could rent a place on my own
A	mm
B	and then at least I could see how I was faring then it would be okay
A	mm
B	but then at least I'd have a little place where I could have all my stuff out
A	I know
B	and you'd feel like it was a little home even if it was just you know with er
A	mm
B	but at least it's her house
A	yeah
B	and it's for her and
A	mm
B	I can get out of my overdraft and I can put money aside
A	mm
B	I
A	I think look at it like that
B	but we'll have to see
A	yeah
B	because just saving even if it was two hundred pounds a month once I clear out of my overdraft and I'm putting money aside
A	well that will add up
B	to save six grand
A	yeah
B	that's gonna take you years
A	I know
A	it's just it's difficult
B	yeah
A	mm
B	all my family are here
A	you
B	I've got friends everywhere
A	yeah
B	it doesn't matter where they are
A	you're free to to to live where you want
B	the
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna move just yet because I've only just started this job and it's
A	yeah
B	it looks bad to move within the year
A	no it's a
B	so
A	exactly
B	I think by the you know come September
A	for a bit
B	I'll start looking at other jobs
A	yeah
B	and looking abroad probably
A	well I think
B	option to
A	I certainly think
B	travel and work
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	and and use this year to consolidate your job
B	mm
A	as it is
B	and save funds
A	exactly
B	we'll just have to wait and see
A	so you've got a new job that you're enjoying
B	yep
A	um
B	clearing my debt
A	clearing your debt
B	yep
A	you're able to save a little bit of money possibly
B	mm
A	if something nicer comes along go for it
B	yeah
A	you know
B	and that's all you can do really
A	huh see
B	I think it's just maybe it's just because it's this year
A	mm
B	er A at the beginning of the year you always look ahead don't you
A	yeah
B	you always look ahead and think well this um you look behind you and think well
A	yeah
B	what could happen this year?
A	yeah
B	you know you wanna  you wanna  always be thinking that something good is gonna happen
A	well don't look at it like that
B	well you can't help yourself
A	no you must
B	but you
A	I think it I think
B	it'd be nice to meet somebody
A	well well of course it would
B	mm
A	you've got a job you like
B	mm
A	you've got lots of friends
B	yeah
A	you've got you know money coming in
B	yeah
A	and you are  you are
B	in the grand scheme of things it
A	mm
B	so
A	you
B	it's only
A	I oh
B	well no
A	right I thought I'd saved my trolley
B	oh
A	that's bloody annoying
B	what are you looking at? Doing a food shop?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	er she didn't give it to me so
B	hmm
A	er but now she has given it to me and and I was gonna go back and look into my trolley
B	it's not there
A	oh no it has
B	oh good
A	oh well there you go eh
B	Good stuff
A	remembered I hadn't ordered any Marmite
B	oh
A	I know
B	mm
A	bloody Nora
B	what? Peanut butter?
A	no
B	oh
A	three pounds
B	huh
A	two hundred and fifty grams
B	that sounds massive
A	well okay
B	mm
A	two fifty
B	oh
A	it must be the middle one
B	Christ
B	mm
A	how can it be so expensive?
B	you think of it as being like seventy P or something wouldn't you
A	yeah
B	probably since I lived here
A	no
B	oh
A	well yeah since you lived here
B	yeah
A	no she doesn't have it very often
B	so it's you know it is a treat
A	how can it be so expensive?
B	mm
A	now they do their own
B	they do their own Marmite?
A	yeah
B	no
A	no? Really?
B	well
A	how different can it be?
B	I always think that about mayonnaise and things
A	oh okay
B	well I mean is it substantially cheaper?
A	er yes
B	well then try it
A	okay
B	time you need it
A	I'm gonna do that
B	oh
A	oh that's two twenty-five
B	well I've not heard from
A	oh dear
B	I'm seeing this guy
A	no
B	he's
A	although she's quite
B	is he six foot five or
A	huh
B	six foot eight? He's ridiculously tall

A	that don't look that short
B	he might be six foot two
A	yeah
B	you know
A	he's not ridiculous
B	no
A	and people next to him don't look ridiculous
B	mm
A	but this guy really did
B	how funny

B	mm
A	what else do I need?
B	this week
A	oh that's a good idea
B	bought button mushrooms
A	I think I'm gonna right okay that's what I'm gonna do
B	did I tell you that my um colleague who went on um maternity leave had a  had a  baby girl called
A	oh
B	it's cute isn't it
A	that is nice
B	she was in labour for sixty-two hours
A	God
B	and then they gave her a C-section
A	it used to be
B	you are
A	it used to be twenty-four hours
B	you and that was thirty years ago
A	yeah
B	when you had me
A	yeah
B	that's surely that's the risk you're putting the baby at risk
A	yeah
B	and the mother at risk
A	oh no
B	apparently she's fine now
A	mm
B	poor little baby
A	mm
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	you know the director
A	oh right
B	um we saw er someone else who'd been on maternity leave
A	that is very nice
B	baby
A	aw
B	five hour labour
A	that's
B	first baby
A	that's really not fair
B	I don't know whether it's because she was
A	it doesn't have anything to do with the labour though
B	it doesn't?
A	no
B	it's just pot luck?
A	it is just luck of the draw
B	she said she just she felt a contraction
B	what are you talking about? And obviously she was furious at the time
B	but obviously at the time she was like what are you talking about? Why are you messing around with the bins?
A	oh my God
B	we've gotta go to hospital
A	yeah
B	and then you know three hours later they had a baby
A	wow
B	very lucky them
A	oh I don't know
B	mm
A	it was very quick
B	oh right
A	you just can't  you just can't  tell
B	oh blimey
A	Don't worry about it
B	no
A	or or not
B	I'm gonna adopt
A	yeah
B	so many hoops
A	exactly
B	there's
A	no
B	competency
A	absolutely not
A	she said the questions they asked me
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	Cos you know
B	yes
A	but I mean really
B	and it is I mean I you know we all love a cat
A	mm
B	Don't listen
A	I know but
B	it's not a baby
A	the I mean it's
B	I mean you have to be responsible
A	their sense of responsibility
B	yeah
A	that's the thing
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	you can't you know our human rights law forbid us from saying to people you can't have a child
B	yeah
A	um
B	yes
A	but but yes
B	it does I mean I
A	I mean they
B	I think people should be asked to take
A	every now and again they change the rules
B	competency tests
B	I really do
A	oh really? Oh dear
B	yeah
A	you can't stop people having children
B	mm
A	you can help  you can help  them bring them up properly
B	mm
A	that's a different matter entirely
B	hmm
A	I think you should teach children to have children
B	well yeah
A	well that's fine
A	I think that's fine
B	er yeah well I you would've thought that part of the neonatal stuff was about that
A	mm
B	does sort of follow on
A	right what um what what what what?
B	I have to go now
A	are you off then?
B	yes
A	okay
B	I'm gonna have to go home
