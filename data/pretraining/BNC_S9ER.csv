A	okay
B	there we go have a have a Quality Street and I'll
A	oh
B	I'll tell you my depressing saga
A	yes
B	oh it is depressing
A	thank you
B	it's not what you think anyway what are you thinking?
A	I was worried it was about your friend
B	oh it is
A	no
B	last year
A	right
B	and she was fine but then
B	that she couldn't get rid off
A	mm
B	but anyway just before half-term I spoke to her
A	mm
B	but they gave her antibiotics and they let her out
A	mm
B	but he said I have looked at a few and it looks okay to me
A	how strong is she?
B	yeah and you know cos you just your immune system's low isn't it?
B	it's in the lining of the liver
A	oh
B	and somewhere else and somewhere else
B	and she said
A	mm
B	but when I phoned her back she said oh
A	they could extend it for?
B	up to two years but then you don't know what her quality of life'll be for those two years do you or it might not be two years so she probably won't make fifty
A	does she want to spend those two years going constantly through chemotherapy radiotherapy?
B	I know
A	feeling like that?
B	and her children are
B	she got them years nine and
A	mm
B	how awful
B	awful
A	that's awful
B	I don't know what to say I just thought oh my
A	mm
B	you know I'm gonna beat this
A	and she did
B	and and she did
A	yeah
B	and she said to me on the phone this week she said
A	yeah
B	now
A	mm
B	how awful
A	mm god
B	just awful
B	oh it was really
A	I thought about her the other day
B	yeah well I mean and I've only spoken to her sort of on and off cos obviously they're down in
A	mm
B	and I really must go and
A	mm
B	it's so difficult
A	mm
B	let
A	you can do that can't you?
B	yes but they always want us all to go cos
A	mm
B	you know they always ask after them
B	on we're not doing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but you can't even do it because your children are at school you can't even say
B	and see a bit of the world I
A	yeah well there is yeah
B	yeah
A	you know he erm
B	yeah
A	and they just did everything that they'd wanted to do
B	mm
A	but they had ten years to do that
B	had they sort of expected ten years though?
A	yeah
B	or was it one of those where the doctor had said and then they'd
A	no
B	lived long oh
A	no
B	they did?
A	because his I remember when he told us
B	oh
A	he knew
B	really?
A	but
B	oh okay
A	because I think in the end
B	mm
B	see and that and that's
A	mm
B	cos she's been coughing all summer but
A	mm
B	and part of me still thinks
A	mm
B	the more it spreads the quicker it is I suppose isn't it?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and it just goes spreads round
B	but but you know the the the awful thing is as well that
A	mm
B	twenty-odd years now
B	and she was diagnosed when she was expecting their second child so they couldn't even start the treatment until you know?
A	mm
B	and she I think the baby was two when she died
A	mm
B	and now
A	mm
B	and I just think you know by the in your in your mid-forties that's just awful isn't it?
A	it is
B	awful
A	it is
B	anyway let's let's not talk about depressing things anymore
A	it's terrible
B	that's all we talk about
A	no
B	you're not?
A	because
B	oh they've decided to
A	let's
B	yeah
B	reignite it whatever
A	yes
B	yes yeah
A	erm
B	oh okay
A	to that yeah
B	cos I
A	mm
B	excuse me I said oh
A	mm
B	and it looked quite a reasonable price way
A	yeah
B	cheaper than the rugby club actually
A	yeah
B	but he said is there anybody else going that we know?
A	well we've done the rugby club one before
B	yeah we have
A	erm which the boys liked because it had loads of funfair rides and stuff
B	I
A	no not
B	I thought it was really
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and he likes going on all of that
B	yes
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	it was just a suggestion that I put to
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	and
A	I would
B	other stuff
A	yeah
B	so perhaps
A	I would've said
B	yes yeah
A	with you
B	yeah
A	but
B	is he doing the hockey on Sunday cos they've got a football match again this Sunday haven't they?
A	mm
B	but it's
A	yeah we've said yes
B	okay
A	erm
B	we haven't replied yet we were one of the names in blue
A	well we were
B	well yes yeah
A	and erm
B	no
A	couldn't plan anything
B	just waiting for the phone
A	well
B	oh
B	at the
A	yeah
B	was it good?
A	it was very good because technically
B	oh so it was
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and
B	oh
A	and so
A	so there's
A	I just got visions of them all crashing into the wings like oh
A	they didn't look like that from the stage it looked beautiful
B	oh really
A	and it was all twinkly and sparkly and loads of dry ice and
B	wow
A	the grown-up rugby players are vomiting it's so scary and
B	yeah
A	disorientated and they were
B	oh wow
A	but as a story it felt more pantomimey
B	oh it wasn't
A	so
B	it wasn't a
A	no no
B	oh
A	so Peter Pan
B	when you said it I assumed it was a pantomime actually
A	The Musical
B	oh okay
A	Peter Pan The Musical
B	cos I was gonna say that was early to have your pantomime already
A	yeah
B	but it
A	no
B	that explains it
A	but it felt a bit
A	and it was like come on
B	a bit more pantomime yeah
A	pantomimey
B	yes yeah
A	well we should do yes
B	oh I've booked my tickets
A	see I have drama rehearsal on Thursday so
B	it's Wednesday to Saturday isn't it? is it the week week after next?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so I'll go and erm
A	there was something
B	oh yes
A	wasn't it?
B	but he wasn't in that
A	oh
B	there were two
A	two halves wasn't it?
B	there were two plays
A	I don't know
B	and then there was another one afterwards
A	mm
B	depending on how
A	well I remember now because I saw my friend
B	so
A	with a fish and chip supper
B	but that's finished now so
A	yeah
B	that one's done and it's just the school show but I should go and see him
A	mm
B	cos I think Les Mis'll be good
A	yeah and the school version is good as well so I think it will be
B	mm
B	so I'm down with
A	directing it
B	and then I'm going to a barn dance on
A	oh
B	well yes I I mean and you know they are always good fun aren't they?
A	did
B	no
B	of course not
A	I couldn't imagine
B	oh gosh do you know?
A	oh right
B	I forget what but he's raising funds and he's got to raise the funds
A	yeah
B	he has to
A	oh
B	in the no
A	oh right
B	county
A	yes
B	thing
A	yeah
B	so in all fairness
A	a good night's sleep
B	a bowl of pasta and a good night's sleep so I'm going by myself
A	there you go
B	but I said to
A	yeah
B	men really are interested
A	I think er barn dancing
B	they don't think it'll be fun
A	they normally say right come on we need eight people for the next dance in you know in groups of eight
B	yeah
A	or whatever
B	you just get on and yeah yeah
A	you know?
B	so I've got a check shirt so I'll be sorted
A	you'll be fine
B	so that's a week
A	you'll be fine
B	and then the that night actually the Saturday we've been invited to a birthday party in
A	which
B	that was the thirteenth and fourteenth of
A	of November
B	November

A	mm
B	you cos I haven't been down to
A	mm
B	just because the boys are always so busy
A	mm
B	so I don't I didn't feel bad because they in fact it's all it's likely to be true
A	yeah
B	that we won't be here
A	I don't know
B	so it
A	if he
B	he tries to not to
A	yeah
B	either way

A	well she's always so busy with work and
B	I know
B	no I know waiting for somebody to say are you alright?
A	because she was doing it
A	yeah
B	just those people just
A	it's so mean of me
B	yes you're a bad person
A	yeah
B	you're a bad person
A	I just thought I'm not gonna ask you
B	see who
A	think there's only about eleven people going
B	oh she's the odd one isn't she?
B	no it's
A	yeah but I dunno if they're not going anymore

A	no
A	no
B	no no you didn't have to be a man it was open to everyone no no
A	oh
B	so
A	no I didn't
B	put your head down and said no yeah mm mm kay
A	yeah
B	well er
A	I don't know I think it's my turn to watch
B	oh is it?
A	I'll have to see what's happening with everything
B	yeah
A	what
B	yeah
A	how is
B	he's fine he's absolutely fine now thank you he had two weeks where he did nothing
A	mm
B	young
A	she wants to see your legs
B	a deep tissue massage
A	mm
B	and she just had him doing all sort of
A	right
B	back at the two points where his
A	oh right
B	you
A	oh right
A	oh right
B	she said
A	mm
B	his running shoes have got
A	and if he's bending funny like
B	yes yeah his running shoes have got erm
A	mm
B	cos they're proper running shoes
A	yeah
B	but it's not but
A	well what do
B	well exactly exactly so I don't know anyway she said to us
A	did she say warm up before you do
B	yes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I suppose they do though don't they?
B	but
A	mm
B	yes
A	they do warm up
B	yeah they do warm up
A	yeah
B	but I think when they've been doing these
A	mm
B	cos they had about an hour to wait before their race and they're
A	mm
B	which is ridiculous
A	mm
B	because it's not normal
A	mm
B	but he was absolutely fine I mean of course he was just driving himself mad in half-term because he's
A	yeah I can imagine
B	he does he does everything and he he wasn't doing anything
A	mm
A	they've got a pitch at you know the AstroTurf?
B	oh did they?
A	yeah
B	did they go down there and?
A	and
B	oh I see or
A	if it cos it was a message on
B	oh the whole
A	Instagram or whatever it is going backwards and forwards but
B	well
A	Snapchat or
B	well if you do too much
A	mm
B	and rest it and he played tennis on Saturday and he said it was absolutely fine
A	yeah
B	so and now we've got these insoles in the
A	good
B	back to you know?
A	and did he trick or treat?
B	no
A	did he find
B	er yes he did get
A	oh
B	erm
A	mm
B	you know everybody
A	mm
B	and last no he didn't go last year cos we were away on holiday but the year before which is the last time he went
A	mm
B	you're fourteen you can't go
A	mm
B	you know it's intimidating and he was like oh well there's a sixth-former going there's so-and-so going and it's on the
A	no
B	if it was in
A	mm
B	lots of people know who he is
B	Saturday night her last night
A	and how you gonna get yourself there and how you gonna get yourself back?
B	how you gonna get yourself there?
B	I said what are you gonna say? he said I'm just gonna blame you I'm gonna say it's all you I said fine say it's all me
B	but really I was so relieved cos he
B	but to me fourteen he's like so big
A	I don't know I have got a different
B	oh you see I don't like I don't like Halloween so I'm probably a little bit
A	we had a
B	biased anyway because I just don't like Halloween
A	what we do we live in a lane where there's about
B	can they come trick or treating?
A	can they come to your house?
B	yeah
A	and then she supplied them with all the stuff
B	oh she supplied them with the all sweets?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	so then she went she made up all these different bags and whatever and went round the day before and gave them all out
A	and then what happened was
B	yeah
A	and erm and then we'd go back and we'd have a Halloween tea
B	mm
A	and they know and and
B	and and that's how it was here when the boys were small
A	yeah
B	we'd cos you'd all been to the toddler groups and they'd all started school together and you'd go around to the houses of the of their friends
A	mm
B	basically or you knew
A	exactly
B	that they were in and that and you know and
A	mm
B	to go off on your own to just knock on people's door I said to
A	just to get sweets
B	you just
A	mm
B	he really should've outgrown it
A	well like I say we
B	but she's still got a
A	but we've got a six-year-old
B	yeah you've still got
A	yeah
B	you've still got
A	yeah
B	an appropriately aged
A	and
B	yes yeah
A	that knew we were coming basically and
B	and that and that was my issue with
B	to go onto the to the new Waitrose estate and all around there
A	mm
B	but it was two years ago that
B	no well that's your friend who's also twelve who just wouldn't entertain the idea of going out trick or treating
A	yeah
B	cos it's for little kids
A	well when
A	and
B	with children yes
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	he wasn't going up
B	yeah
A	as a grown-up
B	and that was and that was how it started originally
B	he's got a little brother
A	mm
B	but and and
A	mm
B	again because I know the people in
A	mm
B	and he's just
A	yeah
B	imagine if he knocked on the wrong door and some old person came and
B	right he's probably right but
A	well I did say to
B	sweets
A	and I and I said
B	mm mm
A	and people that had got pumpkins outside and witches hanging off their garage doors and stuff like that
B	yeah yeah
A	they're obviously geared up for it
B	yes
A	and they wanted people to come
B	yeah
A	no
B	you know and we'll happily put the pumpkin out and that's you know just like a sign isn't it yeah knock on the door we've bought sweets and that that's
A	mm
B	fine and we get loads but erm
A	mm
B	on
A	I know
B	no
A	oh gosh
B	goes in one ear and out the other with that boy
B	you know he just
A	he
B	is
B	yeah I had
A	parents evening'll be interesting er
B	oh I know when is it?
A	I don't know it's not till
B	no probably not no probably after Christmas
A	yeah we had
B	oh how did he get?
A	how?
B	has he
A	do I need to?
B	yeah no no
A	yeah
B	well what time do you need to be back for?
A	well I told
A	oh does he? for the
B	yes
A	so is
B	is
A	well I don't know cos I said to
B	it's today
A	no
A	oh okay
B	oh I wonder what's gone wrong there then
A	I don't know
B	because
A	mm
B	and erm
A	mm
B	erm for however many weeks it's quarter past four till six
A	at school?
B	at school
A	mm
B	and it's always been straight from school half past three till five o'clock
A	oh right
B	the children they put they they learn on
A	oh right
B	so I said to
A	so have you got to go and pick him up at six?
B	yes
A	right okay
B	so er so
A	what time is it now? oh twenty
B	half past three so yeah another
A	past
B	half an hour but oh well no that'll be a real shame if he's
A	I must er
B	because
A	but so
B	oh sports?
A	sports to
B	yes
A	that they've got the highest marks on
B	oh
A	he said because that's an area that not many people go into and it's you can get really good
B	oh is there a course coming up for the
A	and
B	well he that was his sport wasn't it?
A	is?
B	Mr
A	is it?
B	when he was
A	ah
B	younger that was his sport that he played to a very good level
A	right
B	cos he's trying to get
A	oh right
B	erm I said well stop
A	just stop it
B	yeah but he
A	yeah
B	he wants to go on a Saturday morning and referee the little ones
A	well
B	was it part of his GCSE?
A	it was a mixture of things because he came home and said Mr
B	mm
A	but also
B	oh yes
A	it's
B	I was gonna say he looks like he's in school
A	yeah
B	mm
A	he's a year eleven and I said to
B	right
A	so he's he's he
B	right
A	yeah
B	mm
A	doing it to erm
B	I think it was Mr
A	oh well maybe I'm saying the wrong name then
B	because I know I think I started with Mr
A	I'll have to check
B	and it was a hassle you had to you had to
A	oh right
B	yeah they called it an FAN number
A	right
B	I don't know whether that stands for FA number
A	mm
B	and then go on and then you could pay
A	I'll find out because as I say
B	mm
A	at parents' evening he was on about
B	all sorts yeah
B	yes
A	so athletics was one of them he's quite good at that
A	and then one of and badminton
A	mm
B	so obviously he's got tennis
A	mm
B	and potentially he's got hockey although he doesn't play that to a to a particularly good level
A	right yeah yeah
B	cost us three hundred quid it's a good qualification
A	mm
B	call out the score
A	mm
B	and he said I know but
A	so that's after badminton?
B	yes which is why I think that's weird cos again you're just
A	yeah
B	watching a game and
A	mm
B	calling out the
A	there's more skill
B	but if you're
A	mm
B	er
A	well I was just saying
A	it's you've got to have a loud voice a clear voice you've got to be decisive you've got to make the right call obviously the scores the right way round
B	mm
A	erm serves and things like that you know if they're out or whatever you have to just
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	mm
A	it is solid
B	you could do it so there must be something and they'll maybe there's just not many people that do it but it was weird that he said the same to
A	yeah
B	with tennis
A	that is weird
B	cos you're it's not something you'd think would count towards a
A	no but there we go
B	and he's got his Duke of Edinburgh hasn't he he's doing?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	this year it's too much to take on or
B	maybe
B	oh
A	I don't know because with
B	he trains twice a week?
A	yeah
B	oh does he?
A	they train Saturdays and Wednesdays
B	oh I didn't realise that
A	mm
B	and then play Sundays
A	mm
B	mm
A	and so he's doing badminton Tuesdays football Wednesdays football Saturdays
A	you know it's erm
B	it's too much sometimes I
A	mm
B	of the first week so in effect if you don't want to do
A	well in your holiday time
B	your
A	yeah
B	but apparently the headmaster had a different idea
A	mm
B	and I don't know what
A	oh yeah
B	about
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	choose their
B	choose
A	favourite Briton or the best Briton
B	how long was
B	mm so
A	he wrote it all out
B	oh okay
A	but
B	no no oh that's

A	yeah and they do the initial questions and talk you through some stuff and then make an assessment on you
B	right
A	you were speaking to my colleague
A	needs a more in-depth approach on a one-to-one basis rather than just group workshops
B	right
A	okay
B	in-depth issues?
