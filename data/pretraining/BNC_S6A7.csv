A	how was your weekend was it alright?
B	yeah it was good thanks
A	what did you get up to?
A	manic
B	yeah?
A	ridiculous I left here at three on Friday to go to
B	yeah
A	got to
B	yeah
A	then er went out for her birthday on Saturday morning
B	mm
A	rushed back here in the evening to go to this food festival in town it was actually really really good
B	good
A	then went to a pub and stayed round
B	yeah
A	and then like rushed back here Sunday morning had to get changed really quickly go back into town to do the
B	oh yeah?
A	then came here got changed then went back out again to go see er Ed Byrne at the Junction
B	oh yeah?
B	busy
A	I know it was crazy I don't know what's going on in the world did you er did
B	yeah
A	mm not bad what are you making?
B	I'm making some hard boiled eggs to make an egg salad for lunch
A	I don't know I it sounds alright I I like eggs eggs are growing on me but I still can't deal with cold ones
B	I love cold eggs
A	you love it?
B	mm it's good
A	I think it's the smell you know when like you get egg sandwiches and stuff and they always smell weird
B	I love it
A	I love them oh that's such a good
B	I'm tired actually
A	long shifts
B	erm about so it was quite long
A	yeah
B	Sunday was fine I actually quite like working there it's just tiring
A	yeah yeah I suppose if you if you like it then it's worth doing isn't it?
B	mm indeed
A	yeah
B	just hate back to reality on a Monday
A	why don't you just give up and just work in a pub full time?
B	cos I would absolutely hate my life
A	oh okay
B	I enjoy working cos of the people not cos of the work
A	yeah mm
B	I've never made hard boiled eggs before so I hope they are hard
B	okay
A	cos soft boiled is four minutes isn't it? and I think hard boiled is anything over four minutes using that clever observation there
B	I reckon they put it in there for like I'm timing them that must be about six minutes they've got another three minutes to go so I'm sure that'll be fine
A	yeah oh yeah I'd say about yeah nine or ten minutes cos even when you take them out and stuff they'll still cool won't they?
B	yeah true
A	so they'll go hard eventually you know?
B	true
A	that's what you say to men whey
A	ah
B	oh dear
A	dear?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	have you seen er what's his face recently?
A	no he was supposed to come to the comedy last night and then I decided that I didn't want to go with him but
B	oh yeah I forgot that you were going with him
A	so I erm said that I didn't want him to come and that I wanted to go with
B	what did he say?
A	he was like oh I was like well I'm sorry but
B	a bit awkward
A	yeah I bought the tickets you know like it was my he didn't pay for any of them it was my ticket and I was like well you know what cos he was like he he annoyed me and he we went out last weekend as friends obviously
B	mm
A	and then for some reason my friend
B	mm
A	and apparently she's been texting him all week which is fine because obviously like I'm not interested anymore but still it's like dude it wasn't really appropriate for you to come out with like one night with me and then start messaging one of my friends I was it?
B	yeah it's a bit weird but then she is also to blame for that
A	oh yeah I know like yeah my point was that I was trying to get out I was trying to get out of him coming to the comedy so I just used it as a excuse for not wanting him to come to the comedy
B	mm
A	I wasn't I wasn't angry I was just like you know what I think you're a bit disrespectful and I'd rather go with somebody who I like
B	yeah this is true true
A	I didn't say that in like those words I said it very nicely but I was like I'd rather just go with
B	exactly
A	not like we're seeing each other so I don't have to care about his feelings as much
B	exactly
A	I don't want to hurt his feelings but it's not like
B	you don't need to care about them
A	yeah exactly
B	I think this has gone off now I've had it for ages
A	really?
B	really?
A	yeah it's like they pay the same as us but it's in
B	yeah
A	or
B	wow
A	no well minus where the door cuts off like here but yeah it's huge I was just like oh nice size kitchen there's only two of them
B	nice is that the
A	yeah yeah the Aussie
B	cool that's amazing
A	yeah and like both their rooms were quite big and the living room there was only five rooms there was the kitchen living room bedroom two bedrooms and a bathroom and a utility cabinet thing but it wouldn't that's not really a room it's like a cupboard
B	yeah still pretty good for a flat though
A	yeah it was a
B	it's a really shitty fridge
A	so shitty
B	yeah
A	like er has has has
B	did you ring her though?
A	no
B	I might ring her tomorrow
A	she's just shit
B	to let her know about the fridge
A	yeah I'm like have you got my?
B	and then I'm going to email her and tell her that I've let her know about the fridge
A	can you CC me into that?
B	yeah
A	cos then I will be able to be like excuse me
B	yeah I know stop right I'm a bit worried about these eggs now
A	I think they'll be fine hun I don't think you can go too wrong with an egg
B	no but I suppose if if they're not done then that's a complete waste of an egg
A	dad normally no dad just normally leaves them like in the pan for a while
B	oh does he? what? to continue cooking for a bit
A	just yeah like turn it off the boil and then just leave them in there for like a few minutes and then drain the water and you can just leave them in the pan they will continue to cook cos it's an egg so it's not like it will go hard
B	yeah yeah it's still hot isn't it? yeah okay
A	so don't worry it's all good I love peeling hard boiled eggs that's one of the most like satisfying things to do as sad as that sounds god I'm a loser
B	oh it says this says partially fill a bowl with ice cubes in water leave the enough room blah blah blah
A	blah blah blah
B	use a slotted slotted spoon to transfer the hot eggs immediately into cold water and then leave them to cool for ten minutes and then they'll be really easy to peel apparently
A	yeah it's the opposite of tomatoes isn't it? cos tomatoes you're supposed to put in boiling water then the skin comes off really easily
B	yeah yes well you learn something new every day
A	life is a learning curve
B	it's a life skill hard boiled eggs
A	I love that you got to the grand old age of twenty-four and you've never boiled a hard boiled an egg before
B	I've never really needed if I if I wanted an egg salad I'd probably buy it
A	yeah true
B	but
A	and I've never wanted an egg sandwich so
B	yeah so I guess
A	there's loads of weird with things like that like
B	no idea
A	why would I know that I have to use white spirit to clean a brush I've never done painting before in my life like why would I know that?
B	it's only common sense if you know it
A	yeah
B	what spanner?
A	what spanner are you on about? he goes that one blah blah you know whatever special name she's like I don't know what you're talking about go away
B	oh dear joys of DIY
A	I know she erm she went home this weekend obviously and then she came back today and she was a bit sad and she's like her parents were arguing really badly
B	yeah
A	and she's just like she
B	yeah
A	and I was just like god I couldn't imagine my parents getting I know the
B	mm
A	yeah no no yeah I get that but I don't know I just feel like without them being it's not the same
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	yeah I suppose but then
A	I'd rather them be happy apart than like be miserable together definitely
B	yeah
A	but no if my parents would divorce I'd be well upset
B	yeah it's weird
A	I guess it's like easier when you're not like young as in like your age but if you were like if your parents separated when you were like two or something cos then you would never know your parents together
B	I think it would be easier if you were older if you're younger
A	do you think?
B	you always wonder why do you know what I mean and you never grow up with a normal family so
A	but then I guess that's what your definition of normal would be wouldn't it? like your parents live apart
B	not if all your friends had all like their friends like their families together I suppose
A	true but it's weird how nowadays most people not most people that's a complete generalisation but a lot of people actually their parents aren't together it's like becoming weirder having not weirder but it's becoming less common to have your parents still together is some places
B	yeah yeah
A	it's really peculiar
B	it is weird
A	mm but then
B	god
A	I know she's really upset about it
B	did you see her then at the weekend?
A	yeah we didn't really speak I know it was really peculiar
B	sounds weird
A	when
B	so you can't be that busy then
A	yeah it's just like you I was like are you telling me that she hasn't been on Facebook?
B	no
A	yeah that she hasn't spent you know five minutes on Facebook everyday no
B	scrawling through shit
A	yeah and you're telling me that she doesn't have five minutes to send me a text saying hi
B	I don't think that's true really
A	no it's bollocks isn't it?
B	probably
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	that's it it's not that she doesn't physically have time to message me because she does
B	she has yeah
A	like she comes up on my Google chat every single day so not she couldn't just send me a text saying hi
B	how are you?
A	sorry we haven't spoken in a while it would be nice to see you at the weekend
B	yeah
A	no did I get anything like that? no
B	oh well
A	so
B	just shows there's no point in it really
A	exactly I saw
B	that's good
A	she's very happy
B	good
A	and
B	to be fair not that I would be angry about that but I'd be a bit like oh cos you wouldn't want anyone to know that you were nervous would you really?
A	well you would be I would be nervous meeting like my friends like my boyfriend's friends and stuff and it was only me it wasn't like anybody
B	I know but if say if if
A	she didn't tell everybody she just like told one person
B	but but the people that that he was meeting though
A	yeah but she no she didn't know she didn't tell them she just told me we were discussing it and she was like he's really like nervous about meeting people but that's just what I would say to you like even if it was just like saying well I had a boyfriend coming I was it's just general stuff you'd say to someone I think
B	I suppose but
A	well yeah
B	obviously he had little bit of
A	well he properly bollocked her on her birthday
B	not not bollocking not bollocking her no not at not at all but
A	like why am I coming why should I bother coming and stuff?
B	that's that's not needed but I mean
A	and I was like how?
B	he's probably a bit defensive I'd imagine defensive about it
A	yeah I
B	that's probably because he was a bit embarrassed I imagine as well
A	because he behaved like a complete knob
B	yeah
A	and he's like and it was really ironic I was like erm you know I can't believe you've given people this bad perception of me and it's no dude the person who is giving yourself a bad you know perception
B	yeah
A	is you
B	yeah
A	because you're getting at your girlfriend on her birthday
B	yeah
A	he came across as a right knob I was just like er
B	oh dear
A	I know you shouldn't judge someone else who they date but it's just like you can do better
B	yeah but he could have he he's probably a bit insecure as well
A	I think he is yeah apparently like he got really angry with her because they she went on a hen night and one of her like she had to do like a task or something and one of her tasks was to like grind on this old man and he got really angry at her about it
B	he's probably really insecure
A	I think he is like he must be yeah he does look at but he looks a bit retarded but I don't know it's just really weird and you know when you're just like why are you with him?
B	yeah not good
A	and like she said like he does it quite often I was like why would you be with somebody who has no sense of humour and clearly gets at you for really stupid things?
B	they're probably not very suited are they?
A	I don't think they are they're the couple that haven't had sex since they started going out
B	how how long have they been going out for?
A	since Christmas six months
B	really? why not?
A	no they started off as like best friends
B	oh I think you told me
A	last year
B	yeah
A	and they kind of like a grey zone where they were getting with each other and she was kind of like oh I think I like you and he's like oh there's no spark between us
B	oh yeah
A	yeah and then at Christmas he decided there might be a spark so went out
B	yeah
A	and then basically he can't get it up
B	okay so like they're definitely not a
A	apparently she says it's because he's nervous
B	no it's not
A	I'm like no no no if I fancy yeah if I fancied somebody
A	it's be pretty easy to nail them wouldn't it?
B	no they're not right fitting at all
A	no but when I went to see her in
B	mm
A	they had an argument oh no the Alexander McQueen exhibition they had an argument that day because she told him that she loved him and he said my feelings for you haven't really developed since Christmas
B	okay
A	and you're just like no like I did say to her on Friday I felt really bad but I was like it just sounds like
B	you know when someone doesn't like you when they can't get it up like
A	yeah apparently they've had sex once but it was kind of like half hearted apparently he can get up for other things just not sex it's actually I've got no idea but six months
B	he's got some kind of psychological thing going on there
A	yeah I just don't think he likes her enough
B	no
A	I know that sounds horrible and I know you don't want to say that to your friends
B	probably not though probably true
A	but I have a feeling he just doesn't like her enough
B	yeah oh dear oh well that's probably not a bad thing she can obviously do better and that's cool
A	but I don't think she wants to do better
B	oh
A	like she doesn't want to do better
B	she wants him
A	I think she's a yeah it's taken her so long to get a boyfriend that she thinks she's kind of got to like settle for what she's got
B	oh no
A	I know
B	that's sad I don't want like anyone to end up with that life
A	exactly settling the thing is you feel bad for the person who has to settle but you also feel bad for the person who is the one who is being settled with
B	yeah that they're settling for
A	great thanks you're settling for me cos you don't think you know you think you can do better
B	everyone's yeah but but there's no point
A	I think I'd die if that was the case I'm not going to bother with being with you at all thank you very much
B	yeah awful
A	I know it's horrible yeah so it's kind of like the thing is I'm I'm quite open with her like I will say to her like like I said do you think you're just best friends? like I'm not I don't tiptoe around the subject
B	yeah
A	and when like they were like in their grey zone and stuff I was like
B	is there any point in this?
A	yeah I I think if he liked you he'd tell you you know like he'd be there and
B	boys are pretty
A	if they like you they're there if they're not if they don't like you they're not there simple as that
B	is there a reason why he's sticking around?
A	I think he just A he doesn't want to hurt her feelings
B	doesn't want to hurt her feelings
A	and B probably they just you know like they're friends and they probably do get on really really well
B	yeah that's not all of it but yeah
A	there's just not that attraction maybe they're trying to force it
B	maybe he's just kidding himself maybe that's why he can't get it up cos he's just kidding himself
A	he's erm yeah cos it's just yeah it's just a very very weird I don't know I know that if I wasn't having if I wasn't even having sex with my boyfriend after like three weeks I'd be worried you know like
B	yeah
A	six months you haven't had sex in six months
B	especially like I'd definitely definitely be worried if it was him that couldn't get it up either
A	yeah exactly
B	I'd sort of think mm there's probably an issue there like
A	if I if I were dating somebody and he couldn't get an erection I'd be like oh fuck my life I am he finds me repulsive
B	he he
A	yeah exactly it's stupid that we validate ourselves like that but it's true I'd feel it's my fault if he was having problems
B	tragic
A	ah men
B	who needs them?
A	talking of men how's
B	good thanks very good
A	you're seeing him this weekend aren't you?
B	I am I'm going to his house which'll be nice
A	on yeah on the Saturday you're going aren't you?
B	yeah good didn't really spend a lot of time together last time cos I went to see my sister and stuff so
A	yeah you only spent like one day together didn't you?
B	yeah it was still nice but
A	yeah
B	ah there's a trial going from his to work on Monday as well we'll see how that goes
A	from his house?
B	ow why is that so hot? cos I'm I'm in
A	yeah
B	it'll be fine
A	what time do you have to be at work for?
B	have to be in
A	yeah okay
B	he's gonna I think trial going from here sleeping cos he can he's they're doing they're starting to do flexi time at work now so they can do eight till four or nine till five or ten till six so
A	yeah that's what we do in our place
B	so he's going to get he's going to trial going to work from here I think the weekend the weekend after that see how that goes
A	oh okay
B	I can just drop him into the station when I go to work to be honest
A	oh yeah what does he need the
B	yeah exactly so
A	oh okay that's cool
B	yeah it'll be interesting
A	the thing is the trains are really quite efficient the only problem is they're expensive
B	yeah
A	but if he has a railcard and stuff you know it's not too bad
B	no and I guess if he books it sort of a little bit in advance
A	yeah if he knows and stuff so
B	yeah
A	that's good
B	yeah see how that works out
A	how erm I guess to get into
B	well I'm not actually in
A	oh okay
B	before you get at the
A	yeah and also because it's the school holidays the roads are amazing
B	I know
A	I
B	I know it's really annoying it's really really annoying
A	it's just like I'm sorry private school mums piss off taking your
B	can't you get them on a bus
A	yeah put them in a bus or do a car share or something like it is genuinely ridiculous the difference between going to work without schools and going to work with
B	it's nuts
A	it's out it adds a good forty fifty minutes on to a journey if I get the wrong time
B	yeah me too and I'm I've been late like quite a lot of times recently to work but I'm leaving sort of with you know a good half an hour to get there
A	yeah
B	I need half an hour to get to bloody
A	no exactly
B	it can be like forty forty-five minutes
A	like sometimes it can take I can get to
B	it's ridiculous
A	and it's just like that is your stupid fault stupid private school mums definitely generalising there stupid private school people it's like piss off
B	it's really annoying
A	it's the same in
B	I know that's stupid as well
A	I know at least we've got this for another like month month and a half though
B	mm I know I'll be leaving really early now and getting there at like half past eight
A	same same I leave like well I leave early anyway but normally I leave like sevenish and I arrive between half seven and eight now I leave now I arrive between like twenty past seven and half past seven it's ridiculous I'm like
B	so keen
A	normally I do like online shopping or something but still it's like okay
B	there'll be a a an accident
A	yeah there'll be an accident
B	mm
A	I kid you not the traffic was awful
B	the traffic on a Sunday absolutely ridiculous
A	and I was just like why are people doing I would have thought that normal people would avoid
B	okay
A	I was I genuinely I genuinely didn't think I was going to make it to the start line like I had to run from the station
B	that's not that ideal is it?
A	to
B	not only are you doing a bloody running race
A	exactly and then like the queue for the toilet was massive so I had to nip into a local pub I was like now I look like an alchy at like eleven o'clock in the morning going into a pub I was like ah manic
A	I know I was really happy with it although I secretly think that they didn't that it wasn't a full ten K I think they like missed a bit off it still seemed yeah it still seemed quite a long way for me but I was just like mm
B	just don't tell anyone that
A	yeah I know
B	mm
A	it's good though
B	balance on there if that falls out then some of them get covered in nice tomato sauce
A	thanks
B	okay it's okay
A	I do love that Google is literally amazing Google tells you everything
B	well I don't know if that's true
A	what do they say?
B	it's easier to peel an egg that has been cracked all over
A	ah no sometimes I roll it a little bit just to get the cracking started and then you start picking it I wouldn't say crack all over though
B	mm lean it on its side and apply light pressure with your hand as you roll it against the counter this will crack the shell around the egg begin peeling at the large end of the egg there's an air pocket at the end so it's easier to get started without moving the egg white along the shell
A	that makes sense
B	try to get under the
A	do you like the membrane?
B	nope
A	I quite like picking a er cracking eggs do you mind if I do one later?
B	yeah you can do it
A	no no you cannot touch my eggs
B	I'm only going to peel two
A	okay
B	because I will have then I'll have some today and some tomorrow then I'll peel they keep I think they say here
A	well they say here
B	they keep longer for when they're non-peeled
A	okay
B	I'll peel two and then make a salad and then
A	Simon says
B	what if I it's Monday isn't it? so I'll have I'll have two left mm
A	I
B	I'm trying to see if I can work out what I can do with the remaining two eggs
A	egg sandwich?
B	could do
A	or eggy
B	can't make eggy bread with the hard boiled
A	I can't make eggy bread maybe
B	er
A	maybe not
B	I can make an egg sandwich I supposed in the packed lunch
A	yeah
B	sure am
A	mummy P's birthday on Sunday
B	oh yeah? what are you doing?
A	erm our Dutch friends messaged me a few weeks and were like
B	ah
A	so they're flying in from Holland on Sunday morning I've got to go to Stansted to pick them up
B	yeah
A	and then erm and then we're gonna I think go out for lunch or something nothing overly exciting
B	go for it that'll be nice where where did you say you're going sorry?
A	just out for lunch somewhere
B	what what around here?
A	yeah possibly
A	no no we I'm going to pick them up in Stansted then take them to erm back to our house
B	I see
A	in
B	nice
A	so yeah not every day that mummy
B	ah look at that perfection
A	oh
B	easy
A	I think it's so therapeutic peeling an egg
B	they they smell quite eggy don't they?
A	they do smell a little bit eggy I'm not gonna lie
B	hey ho shit happens
B	I quite like the smell
A	I strangely don't
B	sorry about that
A	it smells a bit like eggy farts
B	well now you know where the where they
A	what's weird though is when people have eggy farts but they don't eat egg
B	mm that's a bit weird a bit worrying
A	not that I sniff other people's farts but you know
B	apparently you do
B	thank you
A	you're welcome
B	so
A	I don't think you can get any more information from Google about what to do with your eggs
B	no no I'm now just looking at the measurements of making oh it's asking me to put them in the processor but I'll try to
A	blend them? you've got a little mini processor haven't you?
B	yeah but can I really be bothered to do that though?
A	oh you can just cut them can't you? can't you?
B	fork them
A	fork them we all know what happens when you fork oh no it's spooning leads to forking doesn't it? it's not forking leads to spooning well I guess forking can lead to spooning
B	yeah it probably can in fact it it definitely can
A	I don't know I think they're interchangeable
B	erm how much yoghurt do I need please woman?
A	three million grams little extreme but you know could be
B	hello
A	Google talk to me what is it? what is it? what are you using? BBC food?
B	no it's the thing I pinned on Pinterest
A	oh Pinterest
B	okay this is for eight eggs so
A	oh god so maybe quarter it
B	okay so quarter of a teaspoon of mayonnaise
B	but then a third of a cup of Greek yoghurt so
A	okay
B	one
A	I'm just going to go with the old fashioned way of making it up
B	I don't like making it up
A	see I love making it up I just go I just
B	I like to follow instructions
A	no
B	well a quarter is smaller than a third isn't it? so if I did
A	yes well done brain of Britain
B	I'll just do a quarter
A	okay
B	quarter of yoghurt I need to fork these first
A	fork the eggs
B	they're going to smell even more now so be warned
A	yum yum yum no you're getting egg everywhere
B	oh no this isn't working very well is it at all?
A	no not really I think you should have blended them shouldn't you?
B	I should have blended them oh god
A	well you know at least you know trial and error at least you've learned I like the yellow I just not a fan of the white when it's hard
B	oh so eggy
A	yeah that's what that is normal you wouldn't expect it to smell like fish would you?
B	I'd hope not I probably wouldn't eat it then
A	at least they're
