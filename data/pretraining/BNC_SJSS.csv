C	it's basically just
unknown_female	yeah
C	no it's erm different erm
unknown_female	oh is it?
C	erm it makes it
D	yeah
C	and it's basically all it is is it's your pH balance of your
D	oh yeah
C	bits are different to the rest of your body
D	mm
C	so if you get in if you're sensitive down there like I am to soap and stuff you get it
D	yeah
C	it's
unknown_female	mm
C	summat
A	well it is just your vagina cleaning itself
C	yeah that's basically what it is
unknown_female	yeah
A	it's a shame that it smells so bad
C	yeah it's awful
A	I get it as well with certain soaps

A	and sorry for the detail but after sexual intercourse
C	yeah

unknown_female	I couldn't use pads
unknown_female	yeah I couldn't use them
C	no offence but I I feel dirty wearing them
unknown_female	yeah
C	it's only cos I've got OCD
D	I know what you mean
C	that's the only reason why
A	I don't
D	mm
A	I don't like it though either cos like especially when you're sleeping
C	oh yeah and it goes all the way up your back er
A	it just goes everywhere
D	right
A	and it feels gross and like
D	mm
A	you sweat at night and you think that you've shit you've shit yourself or something
C	and I always
A	it's just the pad going up your arse I'm like er
C	I always think that you can smell it like do you know when I have a tampon in I can't smell my period
B	yeah I know what you mean
unknown_female	yeah yeah yeah
C	but if I have a pad I can smell it and it makes me paranoid about it
B	yeah
D	yeah I can't I just can't use tampons
C	yeah
D	just they're so uncomfortable
C	some
D	yeah
C	mm
C	no but once you've done it the first few times it's fine
B	thing is once you've done it once yeah yeah
D	I know it's just oh it just doesn't feel right
C	cos I was saying
A	have you ever tried one or?
D	yeah loads of times I just can't
A	no?
D	no
C	do you know what is good? erm if you've got erm
D	yeah
C	just put a bit of lube on it and then do it
D	yeah I just cannot
C	but it's when when you're end of your period how painful is it pulling out?
D	yeah like cos it's proper like there's
C	when there's not a lot oh dry yeah
unknown_female	yeah
B	I dunno maybe try it when you're not on just stick a finger up there then put the tampon in
C	yeah
B	but I don't use applicators I can't

C	I can't use them
A	yeah

B	I feel like I feel like I can like put it where I want if I do it myself though
unknown_female	mm

A	with your shits honestly like they never ever stink and
C	no
A	this one time the only time I'm trapped in a tiny cubicle with her is the time that her shit was vile
C	it was she was her eyes were watering
C	it is because I've just gone back onto a diet which is like basically like protein shakes
A	oh my god

C	like it stinks stop doing that
A	the shower cubicles as well you're proper locked in with the tiniest bit of air
C	yeah
A	so
C	and even then that doesn't work properly it's like
unknown_female	oh no
C	cos there's always smell
A	it's healthy
A	right?
D	me flatmate used to put bleach down the toilet after she used to like go for a poo and we always used to be like well we know you've been more now

unknown_female	oh
C	so I can actually hear everyone pooing
D	I can as well yeah
C	and I know when people are going for a poo because they go to that toilet
D	yeah
C	and I heard them spray after like you just had a poo
A	that's one thing I actually can't stand is when the spray doesn't get rid of the shit smell
C	yeah it just covers it
unknown_female	yeah
C	and makes it worse

B	yeah
D	yeah
unknown_female	mm

D	just like when you last had sex and stuff don't they like when when did you last have sex?
C	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	mm
