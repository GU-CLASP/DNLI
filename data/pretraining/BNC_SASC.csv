C	but
B	okay
D	it would be alright but just not at the moment
A	aren't they having huge financial problems at the moment?
B	well that's why you should go there
D	and everything'll be really cheap
B	or we could do a tour of
B	I thought Italy and and Rome and things like that
D	what like Pompeii?
C	mm
D	I've always wanted to go to Pompeii
B	Pompeii
B	okay so Pompeii would make
C	mm
B	mm go on elaborate
C	we don't really have anyone who speaks Italian
D	that doesn't really matter
C	or have anyone who speaks Russian

A	that's so good
D	what does that mean?
C	it means my subjects
A	oh it's amazing
A	it's so well
D	no it doesn't it sounds like he's pretending to be Russian
A	say that again
B	what's his name?
D	but that's just like you're pretending to be a stereotypical Russian or something
C	no it isn't that actual is
C	we have a Russian teacher who is actually from Russia that's how she sounds
A	it's not actually a stereotype
B	well it is a stereotype for a good reason
A	but yeah but it's a realistic stereotype
B	stereotypes are realistic that's why they're
A	that's a particularly realistic stereotype
B	so what do we think? cos I think we need to go back to granny and say
A	I want to go to Russia
D	Italia
B	sorry?
D	spaghetti
B	I said spaghetti just now
B	I mean
C	mm
A	erm

A	so
B	did we say? didn't we count Egypt out on the basis that it's?
D	yeah
A	yeah okay
C	okay so
B	so what do we have? Italy?
D	Italy
A	Italy or Russia
B	it doesn't sound quite as adventurous as
A	yeah
B	the kind of planned Russian outing I mean
C	yeah
B	should we revert to plan A and just tell
D	mm
B	funnily enough the Atlas Of Dream Places
C	mm

B	which is in Red Square isn't it?
C	yes
C	along with the Kremlin

C	it's like their Big Ben
A	Kremlin
B	I mean I don't want to do something that really really really upsets you
D	no I won't
C	you always do
B	and you haven't been able to like
D	just don't want to go is there anything wrong with that?
C	no but we're curious why
D	I just don't want to
B	because Italy's also full of you know? racist homophobes
D	pretty sure it's not
B	it is
C	everywhere is
D	yeah but it's illegal
B	to what?
B	I mean it's a country that where the prime minister owns all the media I mean it's not a great sign I mean
D	do you mean Berlusconi?
B	mm
D	he got deposed
B	mm
D	mm
C	to be fair actually er one of the things in the
B	oh yes what does? what oh the Russian mafia?

D	Italy
B	sorry?
D	Italy
A	oh I'll
B	no you're not helping
D	yeah
B	erm yeah everybody else is altering what they want to do on your behalf
D	well it's not like any of you are averse to going to Italy whereas I am adverse to going to Russia
A	I'm averse to going to Italy
B	averse not adverse
D	that's not what
B	adverse would be something different than averse
A	yes I am
C	he's averse to going to Italy in comparison to being averse to going to Russia
D	shut up
B	who has to shut up?
B	why?
D	being pedantic
A	pedantic
B	no he wasn't
C	no
B	shall I try and construct some sort of a what we would do in Italy thing?
C	okay yes cool
B	see what we could what we cos I guess when you
D	yeah Pompeii and Rome and the Colosseum
B	you see I know I know for sure that Pompeii and Rome are a long way away from one another
D	are they?
B	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	a long long long way away
unknown_female	yeah
B	that's why I don't think I know anyone who's been to Pompeii cos it's nowhere near anything else
D	dad's been to Pompeii hasn't he?
A	no I dunno
B	no
B	no he's always wanted to
D	Pompeii's by the coast actually isn't it?

D	no it's quite wet though
B	does it smell Venice?
D	mm
C	it won't be around for that much longer
B	don't know if it still
C	it's a bit damp
A	how much is it sinking?
C	I'm not sure
B	you're not allowed to take
C	they're probably trying to do something about it
unknown_female	that's cos of the er
unknown_female	cobblestones
B	mm
D	yeah
A	mm
C	ha
B	but that
A	not not
B	you know what's gonna happen here is that we'll come up with some plan for what we'll do in Italy and then granny'll still make the rest of us go to Russia like separately
B	to make sure that
D	well why don't you just speak Russian in Italy cos it'll
B	mm
D	be about as effective as speaking English?
B	I looked up on the internet erm
B	in case of another country go to
C	I don't think there are any others
B	well there are but they're all like
C	next to Russia?
B	like Krygyzstan and
A	there's a
B	stuff I mean
A	there's like a small bit of land belonging to Russia er several borders away from it
D	yeah
B	yeah a a port isn't it?
B	yeah
unknown_female	something like that
B	yeah
C	I'm alright
B	okay mm
D	might as well do it here
B	might as well do it?
D	here
B	here?
D	yeah
B	that's one way of looking at it
D	good point
unknown_female	mm mm mm mm
B	so shall we go for that then?
unknown_female	mm
B	erm
B	okay?
D	why?
B	so I
D	so I can give you money
D	don't need money I've got loads of money
B	don't need money I've got loads of money? great
D	I don't want to take money off you that I don't have to take
B	well you say that if I was like that with granny she'd be very upset
D	what that I wasn't taking her money?
B	yeah
A	what?
B	I mean granny does say and it's true
unknown_female	mm
D	I think that's a really bad thing actually
C	it's good to know someone that like that
D	erm
B	what is your project remind me?
D	er we're designing new packaging for a
B	what sort of packaging have you made?
D	it's like a wrap for a can
B	a wrap for?
D	a can
B	what for a drinks can?
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	why would you wrap a drinks can? why would you wrap a drinks can?
D	so you can put
A	writing on it
D	writing on it
B	oh I see right right right
D	you can't really put print on sheets I don't think you can
B	you can print straight onto it
D	you can but we can't
B	okay
A	burnt
C	you don't have any cans anyway do you?
D	well the way cans are made is they have a
C	yeah
D	printed on and
C	yeah
D	no we're just
B	but what makes that graphics rather than just art? I think that's what I'm wondering
D	oh well
D	don't know
C	it has a
D	art is artistic
C	purpose
B	oh a commercial? has a commercial?
C	yeah
D	there are things that have to be on it like you know? recyclable logos and stuff
C	customer information
B	mm okay
D	I guess it's so the people who need
B	just being creative
D	mm
B	there's quite enough creativity round here
A	what about me?
A	mm yeah
B	no?
A	oh actually
B	yeah?
A	erm
B	oh good
D	about what?
A	social media
B	I think we can guess what it's going to be
D	mm
C	I don't know they're year sevens
A	they're all dicks
B	lots of dicks that would be a reason like
A	no erm
B	yeah
A	no the entirety of year seven is moronic
D	I know some of them
B	you do get years when it's just a bad year
D	yeah I know some
B	imagine being the alright kid in that year
D	mm yeah
B	my sister was in a rubbish year at school
C	oh god how terrible erm
B	sorry?
C	how terrible
B	oh it is horrible though if you imagine there's nobody decent in your year
A	what?
D	there's always someone decent it's just that they don't like you
C	that's the point
B	that's what I'm saying imagine if there wasn't
A	erm couple of days ago
B	what's going on?
A	it was mentioned in assembly
D	did they arrest anyone?
A	no
D	damn
B	is an ongoing?
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	does nobody in year seven know anything?
C	how much investigation does it take?
D	mm
A	well they've gotta work out who it was
D	right mm
A	because
B	god that's not hard are they incompetent?
A	well exactly that's what you'd think
B	they could take
D	most people
C	a few days
D	pretty much everyone has their Instagram name listed
C	well yeah there is that
D	under the thing and also
A	yeah like
C	yeah
B	I guess yeah but I guess they have to find out where where whatever it is originated from
C	they have to find out
B	where
D	it's not difficult
C	in a you have to find out in trustworthy way though
C	you can't just assume that because someone's Instagram name means that a name that it's actually their name
D	yeah
A	er dunno
A	cos I'm not in year seven
D	they probably didn't tell year seven either
B	they're not gonna arrest anybody right?
A	except
D	mm
B	well they say that I mean there was someone who was put on the sex offender's register recently wasn't there?
A	and threatening language we were told
B	oh and threatening then maybe it was bullying
D	oh it's probably it's probably cyber bullying
B	well not just cyber bullying if the police were involved
D	it's just cyber bullying probably
B	sorry?
D	it's just cyber bullying
B	what do you mean by just cyber bullying?
D	I don't understand what the
B	and what do you two think?
A	it that yeah I'm
B	speaking as
A	yeah
D	you hear lots of people
C	the thing is people do care
A	because it's not physical
B	mm
A	block them
C	doesn't mean we can just let them be
D	or you can not
A	yeah in actual real life they can physically hurt you
B	yeah but you people can do a lot of psychological damage by saying things
D	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	it does untold damage
C	although to be fair I'm also with
B	freedom of speech?
C	it really doesn't matter
B	yeah
D	it's people being wooses or being incompetent with technology
B	I don't think you should be quite so dismissive of that
C	that's probably why
A	oh yeah and since then they started putting up a display outside the drama hall
B	mm
C	assemblies are always really bad oh god have they?
A	yeah
B	er displaying what?
C	oh no
A	it's
B	what's wrong with putting up a display?
A	it's
B	E saver?
A	E safer
B	okay
D	is that supposed to be a pun of some sort?
A	I dunno
B	just put E in front of things?
C	oh god
B	what why are you going oh god at just because of a display?
C	cos it's gonna be horrendous
C	it's not gonna work
B	so what would make a difference?
B	I don't think you should say these people are wooses sweetheart
D	not really because they're not true
B	yeah
B	yeah?
D	then what?
B	well that would be really unpleasant
D	but that never happens though
B	no but that's what they're saying on it's cyber bullying
B	that's what I'm saying is that it's really it's really really public
B	it's
D	I don't think it is public it's on private message
B	well no cos people like if someone's taken a photo of somebody saying look at this ugly fat person and emailed it to all their friends or something
C	the email can sort of go around
A	yeah that counts as bullying
D	emailed it yeah good one
B	sorry
C	what?
B	by surprise well she was working in the library at her university and erm a boy in the library wanted to ask her out and so rather than
B	but it
unknown_female	yeah
B	and anyway she said no I've got a six foot two boyfriend
C	gosh
B	and it's a bit well it's kind of interesting she said she had like didn't really expect and anyway apparently the boy's got lots of
B	so that's a happy ending I suppose so
unknown_female	mm okay
unknown_female	okay
A	where's he sleeping?
B	on the sofa I need to find I've found two pillows I now need to find

B	god he's such hard work leave that
C	okay
B	give that to
A	yeah
B	things together please?
C	well I think it's a bad thing but it's not
B	it's not like blowing people up
C	yeah
B	well I suppose that is true it is not like blowing people up but people can get so upset you know?
C	yeah
D	it's cos he doesn't have feelings
B	he does have feelings
B	he does have feelings but it is interesting that if a yeah
D	cos he's a hard nut
B	no not for that reason either it's because he has no respect for anybody else
B	and extremely strong self confidence I think
A	don't know
B	cool thing on the internet what happened
C	someone's
D	sounds great
C	but the point is that you can read them as poems
