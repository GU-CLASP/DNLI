A	I find I have phases though
B	yeah
A	do do you have phases where
B	oh yes really cyclical
A	you know?
B	mm mm
A	it sort of goes by the wayside for a bit
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm I think it's
A	is it then er yay party?
B	because
B	and I don't have a routine and I'm living
A	yeah
B	and I don't have a gym and I can't follow the the sort of erm
A	okay

A	mm mm
B	and then it's Christmas
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	you may disagree
A	are?
B	mm mm
A	so like
B	mm mm
A	next year possibly somewhere in Spain is
B	mm mm
A	so
B	oh
A	quote unquote less healthy and get drunk a lot and party and make friends
B	probably yeah because
A	okay
B	from September to Christmas it's fresher's and you're you know
A	mm
B	two thousand and nine since I've had this sort of
A	yeah
B	don't know
A	erm
B	I don't think so
A	okay
B	thought about it
A	so it's not a problem
B	mm no it's not a problem
A	so you feel healthier for the first six months of a calendar year and less healthy
A	you know it's not a problem don't worry about it I guess
B	yeah it's
A	oh I can take my fleece off
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er
B	yes
A	yeah
B	don't know
A	mm
B	and then from September to Christmas you're like oh well fuck it what's the point?
B	it's you're getting up to Christmas you're not gonna have to take your clothes off in public so what's the point
A	yeah
B	it's yeah it's winter especially living here it's really cold
A	mm
B	so
A	I suppose it speaks a lot as well about
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	I think we all want to be loved and we all want to be liked we all want to have friendships but
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	of
B	aha
A	it's almost like you know you start seeing those things on Facebook about hooray now I can stop shaving my legs now until March but then why do you have to shave your legs anyway? who says?
B	yeah
A	so
B	so yeah and talking sort of more generally than
A	yeah
B	cos I realised a long
B	like I've learned that I've got over it okay people really don't care
A	ah
B	you know?
A	okay
B	do you know what I mean? like you don't have to
A	yeah
B	erm so
A	yerah
B	about their appearance
A	but then why do you care? I mean you know is it a problem that you care? is it? does it matter that you care
B	no
A	fair enough
B	don't think so at all
A	yeah
B	where are we going? we're not on the motorway
A	I've no idea I'm kinda following the
B	car at the front
A	well yeah
A	but did say an hour and three minutes about about
B	I think just keep going forwards
A	now this is gonna put us on the seventy-three and then the seventy-three puts us on the four so
B	well this is a guided tour so the suburbs
A	I know
A	yeah
B	oh you just
A	yeah
B	what kind of car was it?
A	and we
B	yeah you just followed anyone in a Skoda
A	yeah
A	it didn't work
B	that's so funny
A	in a Skoda oh well
B	oh funny
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	that's the dead centre of the city that
B	oh so this is the
A	oh is it?
B	past uhu
A	er
B	yeah because it's near that big red and white tower thing
A	I think we've done a big loop over the north of town
B	I think we have
A	oh we have look look I think that's the signs up there for the shopping centres
B	mm mm yeah me too I've gone the way that goes past
A	yeah
B	erm which is like
A	mm mm
B	yeah I dunno
A	yeah it's the opposite side that I do cos coming from
B	mm mm
A	er what does that say? it says straight on
B	well it just says forward
B	mm
A	yeah
A	oh you're funny
B	I will never go back to that town
A	I know and you keep ending up back there this year don't you?
B	and I've been back up there six times
A	that's so funny
B	I met this student and he was in my upper intermediate teenage class last year
A	yeah
B	and he was just like the naughtiest kid and
A	yeah
B	every week I have to go to like
A	oh god
B	so his parents packed him off to boarding school in Krakow
A	oh no
B	erm
A	poor kid
B	I teach his sister now in
A	okay
B	erm and she's in
A	oh yeah you told me about her
B	yeah so this is her brother
A	mm mm
B	and he's
B	er but they've
A	mm
B	erm
A	did you tell him
B	he was like did you like me? and I was like no you were awful
B	I was just like you were the worst kid out of all of my students you were the worst one cos he's like his English is okay and he's so talkative
A	yeah
B	but I was just I couldn't get anything done cos you just wouldn't shut up the whole lesson
A	and was was he talking in English or in Polish?
B	talking in English
A	that's not not as bad but
A	yeah
B	yeah erm
A	wow
B	I was on this fast train
B	he was like
B	I I was thinking about it actually
A	hilarious
B	if I'd got off
A	the bus is quicker than the train
A	isn't it?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	if I'd got off
A	uhu?
B	it would take an extra thirty minutes
A	oh wow you didn't have
B	so I paid
A	wow
B	and
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
A	or you could get off at the train station instead of walking home half an hour you could get a bus home
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	well
B	and
A	yeah good good cos they're the best
B	but
A	I have been so ripped off just getting a taxi to the train station
B	yeah and me
A	it pisses me off
B	yeah
B	the
A	mm yeah
B	in the city and he was like here it is
B	here it is right on the map
A	yeah
B	anyway it cost me thirty zloty
A	jesus
A	oh no
B	you can't have them
A	oh do you know how difficult it is to get
B	it's not that difficult you were looking in the wrong place
A	it's not for you
B	how on earth I found them in Tesco I have no idea
B	this one
A	oh shit not going to
B	Kaufland
A	Kaufland I've been in there twice and looked and just no joy
A	and I don't like it in there
B	I went there
A	yay
B	so I went to Kaufland
B	I thought well this is the one
A	so you thought this is the one for me
B	but it wasn't actually
A	yeah
B	I didn't have enough stuff to fill it
A	I think
B	yeah
A	okay
B	in the middle
B	so that my stuff wouldn't ooze
A	oh no
B	er anyway
A	yeah
B	did they have lasagne pasta? did they fuck?
A	oh no
B	they had
B	all different colours no lasagne sheets
A	bastards
B	Lidl
A	yeah Lidl's great
A	er oh just disappeared
B	yeah
A	I know
B	but why would I go to the effort of doing all that and then waiting another thirty plus
A	yeah
B	fifteen minutes to make it and then
A	yeah
B	throw it together oven half an hour boom done
A	and if you do do a ginormous one
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah so I've got erm
A	good
B	yeah
A	which I just love they are just so delicious
B	yes
A	just had a thought I am in slow lane aren't I?
B	yeah
A	yeah okay
A	yeah
B	so I'm really getting into cooking I know like lasagne's not getting into cooking but
A	good
B	yeah
A	you've pierced the film lid and put it in the microwave for three minutes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I'm just
A	you were so pleased that I got the fast train I've saved twenty minutes
B	wow great
A	what are you gonna do with all this time?
B	no no
B	right let me tell you what fucking happened
B	about that fucking train going to Krakow right
A	yeah
B	got to the train station about ten minutes early to get my tickets
A	oh jesus right
B	tickets right
A	jesus
B	and had to get on the bus
A	I bed you sighed a lot and tutted at them
B	I did
A	yes
B	but she was buying tickets
A	ah no
A	yeah
B	then had to wait fifteen minutes for a bus
A	so your plan to find an additional thirty minutes of non-travel time in your day was scuppered
A	that's the universe going ha ha
B	yeah
A	yeah no
B	I said right I'm gonna get in around twelve and he said oh I've got a lesson at twelve so I'll call you later
A	oh no
B	of course I wasn't fucking there
A	oh no
B	trying not to kill the woman
A	yeah
B	er so yeah
A	nothing
A	okay
B	this extra twenty-five minutes
A	I know
B	two more zloty
B	oh god but I did nearly finish a book on that bus so I was pleased
A	yeah
B	no idea what it's called
A	oh
B	I don't know
A	oh
B	when it will be number four
A	good for you
B	January
A	and you're going for thirty books this year?
A	by female authors?
B	by female authors
A	good
B	thought about it and I can read books
B	this is the rule
A	is there is there a difference in books written by a female author compared to a male author?
B	I've not really thought about it properly yet
A	no
B	I need to do a little bit more reading
A	okay
B	this very erudite and sexist research project
B	no I haven't yet
A	did you have a look at the
B	it looks exciting doesn't it yeah really exciting
A	yeah that looked fantastic all those
B	yeah
A	spend some time
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think it'll happen eventually at the moment
A	yeah that's cool
B	yeah
A	I've decided I'm
B	good for you
B	a change is as good as a rest
A	exactly yeah so I'm gonna be a farmer this year and then next year we'll see
B	uhu?
A	and there was
B	mm mm
A	all in one
B	uhu
A	and there was actually one
B	mm
A	in the less touristy bit
B	that's kinda nice
A	and the reviews were saying oh my god I've done loads of these Workaway things and I've stayed all over the world and this is the best yet because the work's not that difficult and the people are really friendly and
B	oh cool
A	and it was funny
A	they're looking for people from this week
A	now I've put off my students then technically I could
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	but no I'm gonna stick my feet up for a bit longer
B	erm
A	mm
B	uhu
A	which is pretty cool
B	it does
A	oh
B	yes it does
A	well we've managed not to slide off the road so far which I'm quite pleased about
B	yeah these roads are pretty pretty good
A	yeah
B	no
A	was it a buzzard?
B	I don't know
A	was it a big bird
A	yeah that'll be a buzzard
B	yay
A	yeah when I came from Krakow to
B	uhu uhu
A	erm
B	nice you'll just have to come and drive along this motorway every so often
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I suppose now
A	it's proper Poland completely cos there's just so many hills and
B	there
A	yeah
B	yay
A	it's really nice
B	yes
A	oh
B	not a lot going on there's a couple of schools advertising already but I just think like
A	yeah
B	why are you advertising in January for September?
A	yeah
A	somebody's told me I can't remember who it is
B	yeah it is
A	quite often
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	all that's gonna happen is I'm still looking and gonna get a better job and turn these poor people down
A	or they're gonna keep looking get a better person with more experience and let you down
B	yeah
A	so
B	so
A	it's a lose-lose
B	what I'm gonna try
A	definitely
B	rather than
A	yeah
B	doing this sort of random stuff
A	yeah
B	cos I know people who live in Barcelona in Malaga
A	aha
B	you know going out on a whim and just finding some job somewhere
A	yeah
B	yeah it is
A	and there are so many bad bad bad schools out there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah
A	it's a tricky one
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I'm not worried like I'm really not worried about it I know that
A	oh god course you will yeah
B	it's not
A	and you wouldn't know where you're meant to end up I think there's
B	yeah
A	a fair degree of
B	absolutely
A	you know you've just gotta put yourself our there make the effort and look
B	mm mm
A	it'll be perfect
B	yeah
A	well spotted
B	I needed that bird
A	you are a buzzard expert
B	er
A	I love buzzards that's just beautiful
B	I needed
B	I needed that year
A	it's good it's good if you can look back now
B	mm
A	I suppose any period of feeling not good is
B	yeah
A	yeah I've given I'm giving myself a little bit of a hard time about where I'm at here now because I get really bored sometimes
B	mm
A	and I
A	I do think part of it is maybe I need this
B	yeah
A	time
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	mm
A	in the meantime
B	mm
A	time going within
B	mm
A	but then
B	yeah
B	mm
A	feel it's a
B	mm
A	doing the inner work preparing for
B	yeah
A	so
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	it does and I think
A	yeah
B	without rush erm
A	yeah
B	er this
A	just being
B	er
A	time
B	yeah
A	being rather than doing I suppose
B	yeah
A	or doing on the inside but
B	yeah
A	not a lot of being in
B	mm
A	so yeah
B	and you know last year I used to really envy my friends at home who seemed to be doing exciting things
B	like
A	mm
B	isn't a big deal we do it all the time like this
A	yeah
B	me last year you know
A	ah
A	ah
B	I did go for lunch occasionally
A	yeah
B	I used to be sort of envious
A	yeah
B	taking it for yourself
A	you were doing quite a bit of that the end of last year
B	yeah
A	it was I sort of got the impression you went a bit
B	yeah I did
A	yes good for you
B	er and I said I was having this conversation with
A	it was yeah
B	and I just thought
A	in your space
B	fuck it I didn't sign up for this
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and not always in your physical space
B	and not in my space and
A	yeah
B	you know ah
A	which particular Australian? I think yeah
A	the one you went to see yesterday
B	er like
A	yeah
B	erm I'm just not
A	fair enough
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know
A	and you can also change your mind
B	yeah
A	cos I think what's right for you in one particular moment might not be right in three days three weeks three months three years
B	yeah
A	and you have the right to change your mind at any moment
A	so
B	yeah
A	no good for you
A	you don't have to be yeah
B	you know?
A	mm
B	okay like you don't have to be everybody's friend
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I agree
B	and don't spend time with people just
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know being vegetarian if I'm hungry
B	yeah
A	probably
B	mm
A	but then I don't know
B	I'm okay
A	blast it up a little bit?
B	I'm alright
A	good
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	she's up five o'clock six o'clock
B	uhu
A	and I wouldn't want to have
B	yeah
A	beyond eight or nine
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm
A	yeah the walls are paper thin I can hear her talking on the telephone
B	but like
B	empathy
A	yeah
B	I'd go well
B	and I don't wanna upset the neighbours but he just can't see things from anyone else's perspective apart from
A	yeah
B	you know him
A	do you know?
B	is it with arm rests?
A	yes
B	yes
A	just to see who chooses to put their elbow all the way across the arm rest
B	yeah
A	men
B	yeah
A	they'll use it
B	yeah
A	have you done the same?
B	I've I well I've not but
A	ah
B	so in the street if a man walked towards her she wouldn't move out of the way she'd just carry on walking
B	and she was on
A	who was shouting at her?
B	no men no
A	she was only doing it with men? she was a woman
B	only
A	okay
B	erm
B	on the tube
B	and when it was time for her
A	wow
B	and she stood up and went you don't always get the fucking armrest you've gotta compromise sometimes this is what it's like being a woman all the time
B	er and she just you know stood up for herself
A	wow
B	er
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know women's right to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I do wonder also if she's experienced a bit of that because she's looked for it she's expected it so
B	uhu
A	the universe has delivered back what she's expecting to see
B	yeah
A	you know
B	uhu
A	with just my
B	yeah
A	this kind of thing flashing
A	thing so
B	oh dear
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	this just sort of lack of I don't know manners and you know I just don't think a woman or a girl would ever do that
A	yeah
B	erm
A	no it's interesting it is interesting
B	mm mm
B	mm mm
A	mind you saying that you know my mum did go out to work as well she did both cos she was a superhuman
B	mm mm
A	I was born
B	mm mm
A	and my parents were born mid forties
B	mm mm
A	so
B	yeah
A	she
B	mm mm
A	which
B	yeah it is saying you know I'm looking for a fight I suppose
B	or is it or is it just sort of challenging
A	yeah it
B	it's expected that we're gonna move out of the way
A	it's an interesting experiment I suppose you know I've done it from
B	yeah
A	from the other way I've not taken the armrest to see if a man will take it and found that they do
B	mm mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	so I've done it form the viewpoint of I'm not taking the armrest
B	yeah
A	and then observing what
B	yeah rather than try
A	yeah whereas your woman has said right it's mine
B	yeah
A	which I suppose even a woman might find that a challenge I don't know
B	mm mm
A	would she be
B	yeah abused in the same way I dunno
A	don't you just hate this? I pulled out to overtake this car and the car sped up you
B	erm
A	yeah are we nearly there yet? I need a wee
B	I know
A	yeah I do
A	I'm not desperate
A	we must go before we leave and go when we get there if there's an opportunity along the way
B	you never know
A	pelvic floor?
B	yeah I do it's
A	yeah
B	it's
A	you can do em now
B	it's
A	and squeeze
B	I you know erm
B	alright
A	oh wow
B	not because of your breathing but because of the coughing I cough more than normal people because of my asthma
A	right
B	erm and repetitive or chronic coughing
A	how interesting
B	cos these muscles are being er relaxed when you cough or something like this anyway
A	okay
B	in the gym
A	yeah
B	if I'm
A	oh my god don't skip don't skip
B	I have to go to the toilet
A	or star jumps
A	start jumps are the worst I can't do more than five star jumps and not wee
B	like
A	but anyway
B	I've had to yeah I've really thought about going to see someone
B	er yeah but there's like things that you can do or muscles that you can build I mean not like your pelvic floor muscles but if you improve like your posture for example it helps
A	yeah
B	everything is connected
A	might find it helps your lungs as well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah it's not been so bad
A	good
B	without any really
A	I keep getting sick this winter
B	mm mm
A	I bought something back from
B	mm mm
A	it's a lung thing I looked it up in my
A	yeah eating white foods is meant to be incredibly good mushrooms and things like that and then there are some qigong exercises
B	marshmallows
A	yeah there's some qigong exercises as well
B	mm
A	which I've got to do reading actually you might might enjoy some of those
B	yeah
A	yeah and strengthening these this particular
B	mm
A	for the lung
B	the old pelvic floor
A	oh dear
B	look at the birdhouse
A	oh that's cute isn't it?
B	ah
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	doing classes and you know being up there talking in front of people
B	oh god
A	loads of burpees
B	mm mm
A	without sort of Tena lady
B	yeah
A	but you think they would teach them
B	yeah
A	I mean you know equally they can
B	yeah at the end
A	yeah right just sit and clench
A	relax and clench
A	okay repeat for sixty seconds
B	oh no
B	no yeah
A	no I suppose anything with the
B	mm mm
A	especially in Northern Ireland
B	mm mm
A	do tend to be a bit fucked up when it comes to
B	oh
A	talking about life the universe and everything
B	in the gym
A	uhu
B	erm as I was bending with his hands like under my armpits just to help me
B	that was like
A	yeah
B	but we were nearly
A	yeah
B	and I just thought
A	yeah
B	and I will get used to it and I will
A	yeah
B	and I find that really weird
A	which you can understand
B	yeah
A	yeah

B	in a gym setting where you're fully clothed and you're holding a weight on your shoulders
A	yeah
B	it's the most appropriate time for that to happen
A	it's fine
A	yeah
