A	erm this is kind of a first attempt at the old erm sautéed potatoes haven't done this in a long time so
B	how do you do sautéed potatoes?
C	I'm sure it'll taste okay
A	are you alright in that chair?
B	I'm okay
A	yeah?
B	yeah I wouldn't worry
A	yeah
C	looks nice anyway
A	yeah
B	what's the er chicken sauce?
A	it's one of those Maggi ones
B	do you know what?
B	mixed herb
C	we haven't tried any of those yet
B	no we haven't we haven't we've cooked a lot it's weird isn't it? we've cooked a lot but what have we been having?
C	well we went to the butchers on Saturday and got
B	oh that was so good
C	a ridiculous amount of meat that we've not actually been able to get through this week
B	for
A	mm
B	for twenty-two quid
C	I was thinking about this though I think what we should've done is taken the meat out of the packets maybe put it either in Tupperware or frozen it straightaway because when I cooked that mince last night it wasn't off by any means but it had already gone a bit brown
A	mm
B	mince is alright brown though beef
C	and er well I wouldn't have cooked it if I didn't think it was okay but
B	yeah it's good it's good it's even better
B	no definitely is I think you're meant to make you're meant to let steak go slightly brown
A	you are
B	you
B	just trust me
C	okay famous last words
B	mm mm
A	er do you know there's a lot of food waste around ain't there? because people use those use by dates as erm
B	use by dates or they use best before dates as
A	gospel you know
B	yeah
A	and I think sometimes
B	er I agree
A	you can actually use products
C	I know but we've got we leave
B	got bacon left that's it
C	got bacon left yeah which I think we'll probably use tomorrow night
B	yeah
C	and I'm sure it's fine but obviously it it
B	it's not vacuum packed
C	it isn't vacuum packed so
B	no
C	you're just it's not it isn't gonna keep quite as long
B	agreed
C	but you should've seen these chickens
B	chickens?
C	chickens
B	paid eight quid
C	yeah eight pound for four erm but I have honestly never seen chicken breasts so big
A	mm
C	they were absolutely huge like
B	you know when they're cut slightly in half and it's like flat? they all had like er
C	basically another breast
B	another breast yeah
A	right
B	I'd say that little flap was about the same size as a normal breast
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	it was crazy they were huge absolutely huge
A	mm
C	so that was quite nice
A	yeah
C	like
A	mm
C	when he went to work
B	oh yeah
C	so it is going a long way but like I went and did a big shop on Sunday morning cos we were having
A	mm
C	so that's seventy quid like without any meat which is quite a lot of money
B	there's cleaning stuff in there as well
C	but yeah I had bought like fabric softener and kitchen bathroom cleaner all that kind of stuff
A	mm
C	and there was like a couple of things that kind of topped it over the edge and actually we'll have a quiet week next week cos
A	okay
B	yeah
B	so I won't eat
C	so he won't be eating much on Tuesday and then we're away from Thursday through to Monday so I imagine we'll just try to make do with what we've got in the cupboards
A	mm
B	got fish and stuff
C	we've got fish we've got other stuff as well that we'll make do
A	er are you having that procedure done at our place or at the
C	guess what time they've given him did I tell you? quarter past four
A	oh for goodness sake
B	bit harsh isn't it?
C	we
C	we need we need to go back through the literature cos I'm not really sure whether he he can have dinner the night before or not cos it's so late I'm I think he might have to take those sachets like first thing in the morning
B	no one's the night before
C	do you think so? even er even
B	I think I think they're both the night before
C	even for a four o'clock appointment?
B	I think they're both the night before
C	mm I'm not sure
B	still a long way
C	I'm sure it was like if you were in the morning you take them the day before both of them one at lunch one at dinner but if you're in er an afternoon appointment you take one the night before and one first thing in the morning I'm almost certain of it
B	okay
C	well we'll that's what I mean we need to go back through it don't we?
B	yep
C	but yeah
A	it would seem an extraordinarily long time between kind of eating the evening before cos I'm sure once you start taking them you're not supposed to eat again after that but
C	no
B	I definitely can't eat that day I know that
C	we'll have to think of something nice you can eat afterwards
A	but I think I think you probably can have clear liquids so you might find there might be a soup a clear soup that you can buy
C	yeah or you can just like save yourself and like binge on Tuesday night when you get back
B	oh yeah
C	although the last
A	oh right er well personally I found that one better than the endoscopy
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I think it just kind of does your dignity
B	mm
A	dents your dignity rather than it being painful or
C	yeah
B	yep
A	mm
C	be happy to start getting some answers I think er
A	mm
B	mm
C	it'll be worth it
A	mm
C	I'm erm I'm gonna go in early on Tuesday so that I can come back and take him
A	yeah
C	saves
A	mm
C	yesterday from what I
A	okay
C	so erm they were keeping it a secret cos they didn't want him to know when all of his stuff was coming down
B	cos he he keeps waking up really early for no reason
A	mm
B	so like when he had his cast off he woke up at I think it was woke up at five o'clock for a ten AM appointment in
A	mm
B	just to get dressed
C	so yeah so they've been keeping it from him and also because erm they wanna get the bathroom and kitchen sorted before he actually moves in
A	mm
C	so they didn't want him to think that oh because he's got the keys to his bungalow he's moving in
A	yeah
C	erm but as far as I can tell the erm they went to see the bathroom people in
A	mm
C	erm I think they're gonna go through them to do all the bathroom stuff and he seems to think that they can act on it like straightaway
A	yeah
C	so hopefully it won't be too long cos I think I mean you're not completely convinced by him living on his own anyway are you? but
B	no I'm just worried about him I don't think he's ready
C	but they need to try it don't they?
B	yeah
C	they need to try it they need to give him his independence and
B	can't do this yeah
C	mm we'll see it's all been kicking off this week erm
B	yeah
A	okay
C	erm so he sat I don't know how much of it you know or remember or anything like that but he sat an exam back in May all of the penultimate exams but it's supposedly the hardest one you sit and he was basically saying that over half the people that sit it fail it
A	right
C	and he came out of it wasn't really sure how he'd done et cetera et cetera but when he got his results back I think he er got like fifty-six percent or something which was more than what he
B	no there was a few of them he did he got like seventies and
C	oh yeah he got some really really amazing results
A	mm
C	but he got like fifty-six percent on this exam that
B	was that the one?
C	no and then er and then a collection of like basically fairly outstanding results so he's really really chuffed he got a letter a couple of weeks telling him that he was like one of the top in the UK for
B	no ninth overall so that's that's in Europe isn't
C	yeah it will still be in the it won't be Europe
C	really?
B	yep
A	mm
B	it was out of five thousand five hundred people or something
C	and came ninth
B	came ninth
A	that's impressive
B	yeah he must be doing something right
C	mm
B	not bad erm he I haven't told you about the cos I spoke to him today erm his latest plan is that they're gonna build a house
C	okay
B	and have already applied for planning
C	I don't think that's er I don't think
B	I don't know but
C	no
B	still
C	have they found a plot of land or anything? surely if they're applying for planning permission
B	right so it turns out that
C	yeah
B	he owns the house that
C	yeah so they wanna build a house next to her parents?
B	they're gonna build a house there in the
C	oh
B	at the bungalow's back garden
C	oh
B	er cos
C	that's fairly big news and I think they'll get a lot more for their money building their house
B	you know he said it'll cost them like a hundred and something K
C	oh yeah
B	and it'll be worth like two hundred and something
C	and the rest
A	mm
C	given the location but they're committing themselves to living next to her parents for a considerable amount of time
B	yeah and the deal was would be that they can't sell it to someone else so they'd have to keep it or sell it to
A	mm
B	three of his houses yeah
C	that's very very generous of
B	what? to give them the garden?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	that's that's
A	that's huge
C	that's yeah
A	mm
C	that's really big news that's exciting
B	yeah
C	and it's scary as hell and it's gonna take them well
C	having watched Grand Designs
B	yeah but they've got one to live in the whole time
C	oh yeah
B	and if they don't even er cos I think they'd have to do it off loans
C	no
B	so buy it start it off with loans and then once they've got
B	part of the house
C	mm
B	they can mortgage it
C	erm it's not quite part of the house the house has to actually look like a house you can't
B	just look like a house?
C	erm
A	it has to have four walls
C	yeah
A	and a door
C	so it it effectively has to be kind of inhabitable for you to be able to get a mortgage
B	er a shell a shell at least
C	yeah
A	mm
C	so you can't it's not like you can put the foundations down and be like okay now I'll get a mortgage on the foundations like it does have to still has to resemble a house but yeah that's that's that's how they do it on on like Grand Designs and stuff they tend to erm they tend to erm use any savings and stuff they have to like buy buy the land and then they'll take loans out on the building and then like throughout the process they'll apply for a mortgage and then kind of gradually as the house gets more and more finished as it were and the value increases they can increase the mortgage
B	okay
C	so effectively like if the house is just as it is obviously it'll be valued a lot less than if it's a finished house so they'll get a loan out then once it's valued at a little bit
B	er
C	yeah
B	er
A	what does he do now? where is he working?
B	he is an accountant he's not chartered
C	er just in er independent like accountancy firm I think
B	and I don't think
A	mm
C	and to think that he's saved enough for a deposit down there which would've been substantial
B	yeah he's got he's got enough for a deposit
C	stamp duty on top of that like all the legal fees on
A	mm
C	like
B	when they were yeah when they were looking for a house
C	they have a substantial amount
B	the only thing that
A	mm
B	in case you lose your job and that's the only bit he didn't have erm so yeah he must be on a decent wage so if he has that they've got er
C	mm and er they will the loan'll be fairly high interest so it
B	yeah
C	it'll be it'll be a bit crap to start with because they'll probably be paying quite a lot of money each month to pay for the loan but as soon as they can mortgage that it'll become a lot like a lot more manageable because I'm pretty sure obviously with personal loans you you can't have them anywhere near as long as you have the mortgage which is why the repayments are so high and the interest rates will be generally be a bit higher than they are
A	mm
C	in the mortgage as well
A	yeah
C	so I imagine it'll be one of those things they will be able to get a loan but they actually probably
B	they want to get a mortgage straightaway yeah
C	they're having to get it as soon as possible yeah
A	mm
C	but I mean
B	yeah
C	mm
B	knows what he's doing on the money side of things
C	that's exciting
A	it is isn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm don't er I don't envy them tying themselves quite like that
C	cos like to
B	yeah
A	yes cos I mean if if they can only sell it back to him
B	oh no yeah
A	they've got they've gotta accept his offer
C	mm
B	well yeah I think they'd end up getting
C	well who knows
A	yeah
B	well you could mortgage that and use yours as a
A	mm
B	they'd
C	I can't believe they've already I can't really believe they've already applied for planning permission either cos that means they've already got plans draw up like
B	no you can get planning permission to have use the land as
C	just a dwelling
B	a dwelling yeah
A	mm
C	I thought when you applied for planning permission you had to have like oh this er
B	no I think
C	this is what we're applying for
B	I think you can apply to build like a two two-storey two-bed house or something
C	oh right okay
B	erm and then you can then you have to have all the relevant parties that it would affect like to be in on it so then you've gotta tell people but obviously the bungalow that's there is being rented out to someone er let out to someone so they'd have to tell
C	I don't think as erm like if they were renting
B	tenants
C	yeah
B	no but still yeah
C	a courtesy thing yeah that's quite exciting though now I I would love to build my own house but I'd be so scared that
B	well that looks not a dream house to build is it? that's just a
C	no it's just a oh this this is the best option we have at the moment I'm so fickle as well like one minute I'd be like yeah this is exactly this is exactly what I want this is the perfect use of this space this is gonna be like a brilliant house and then I'd build it and be like oh why did I put that wall there? or like why have I chosen to do that that way? or
A	mm
C	oh why didn't I try that? or why didn't we do this? and you can't blame anyone you can't be like oh well you know no house is perfect or well this is just the way it came because
A	mm
C	you chose to do it
B	mm
C	but that's exciting
A	mm
C	so when is he putting a ring on her finger?
B	dunno
C	yeah
B	reasons
C	yeah oh I'm just gonna finish my exams oh just
B	gonna build a house
C	gonna wait till the house is built
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I would I don't think your mum does know cos I almost feel like she'd been sobbing while she was telling us
B	why? that she's lost him?
C	yeah like that's not just losing him that's like oh I'm gonna build a house in my mother-in-law's garden
B	yeah but I heard not long ago that I heard not long ago that they could er always move back up here to commute to
A	mm
C	and up north I heard that they
B	yeah
C	it's the same with her like both of them are transferable skills
A	they are supposed to be developing the north aren't they? where did I er? there was also erm oh I think you may've mentioned it a few months back that the east the kind of
B	east
A	East Anglia
A	and that was gonna be the most developed erm area over the next five years
C	they're putting so they're
B	scone
C	scone?
C	erm yeah so erm from
A	mm
C	erm
B	well there was something in the news about tourists coming here and it mapped out like tourist attractions from
C	mm
B	and it was a joke
A	mm
B	like the route that you have to take was so obscure
B	and like hard cos er it's just such a bad country for transport
A	yeah
B	and just
C	mm
B	getting around we're not a big country
C	but like it's not as if rail's even cheap now so I'm concerned that if they are planning to put a load more infrastructure in that the only way they're gonna be able to pay for it is by charging the people who are using the trains so
B	yeah but that's still another
C	what's that?
B	HS2
A	HS2
C	yeah it's a way off still I think
A	do you want any forks? or
B	I won't use a fork
B	I'll use my hands
C	erm
B	use a fork
C	I probably should use a fork
B	what for?
C	it's just etiquette isn't it?
A	mm
C	erm
C	okay I think I'm gonna go scone then
C	does it pass the touch test? or?
B	I dunno I might I might might
A	you didn't want one did you?
B	er no thanks
C	well it wouldn't be unlike you to not have both so
B	I don't know what to do
C	well they need eating
B	can I
C	not satisfactory?
B	it's alright actually
B	that's what they said about you
C	that's just rude
C	how's
A	he's alright
B	is he at football?
A	yes but he he seemed he seemed happy that he'd get to speak to you tonight at some point so
C	he's
B	oh
A	er he has been working yes
B	oh good
A	the last couple of weeks so
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah that's good news but still not
C	still not making a lot of money
A	no
B	yeah but I think he's always happier when he's busy
C	mm
A	he does seem to have a bit of er a bounce if you like because he likes what he's doing
B	yeah
A	I think he enjoys the physical labour being outdoors
C	and I think it makes a huge difference when you do something that you want to talk to people about
A	mm
C	so like he can come home and he can talk about the project he's working on
A	mm
C	talk about the things he's learning or where he's been working whereas in previous jobs it was just all so monotonous
A	yes
C	I don't think he could even bring himself to like
A	mm
C	when he wasn't working
B	yeah but that's what we're like we're like about our jobs you have an end product that's had problems along the way that you've solved
A	mm
C	mm
B	projects it's always about projects you wanna you wanna finished good or product at the end
C	you want something to measure yourself by
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	well it'll be nice to see him as well he keeps saying he's gonna like pop in and never does so
A	well I think he may he may just be reluctant to just drop in and he hasn't had any credit for his phone for months
C	well if he's driving all the way over to
A	well yeah
C	dad did it like a couple of weeks ago literally just dropped in on his way back from the golf course like it's almost nicer to see people like that
A	mm
C	because it doesn't feel like it puts you out that much just for them to pop in and say
A	mm
C	hi
A	yes and I nearly did that at the weekend but I thought mm I really wanted a really quiet
A	do nothing weekend so
B	we had a barbecue on Saturday with one of the
C	mm
B	erm that was nice
C	mm
B	and then on Monday we had the table delivered
A	oh yes
B	yeah
A	how does that look?
B	have you
C	it looks really nice I don't think I
A	are you happy with it?
C	oh yeah I might do actually
B	erm yeah I'll show you in a bit that's good erm and then
C	with the hoover she's donated us her upstairs hoover
B	but apparently there's a hole in the tube so you can't use the well you can use the the nozzle but you've gotta like play around with it
C	we're just grateful cos the house was starting to look really messy
B	yeah
C	er like the messy that's like not messy just like
A	yeah
B	just a bit of fluff on the floor
C	yeah
B	and er
C	obviously with it being a new carpet as well like and cream you just see absolutely everything and it's getting really frustrating and
B	stuff in the tiles as well
A	mm
C	like went into Currys at the weekend and the Dysons all had a hundred quid off and we're like that is a really good offer but even with a hundred quid off they were still two hundred and fifty quid and we were like
A	well er
B	are they? what are they like?
A	but they're new and they're they are the highest power
B	that you're allowed these days?
A	mm
C	mm
A	so
B	they've made they've totally like zapped that haven't they?
A	they have recently
B	yeah
A	but obviously there's gonna be er retailers who've got stock of
A	the higher powered stuff so
C	yeah
A	erm
B	cos er the
A	I think it was below two hundred
B	ah
C	er cos that we want yours like the little lightweight ones
B	yeah
C	we can't find them anywhere
B	er well no there there was one that it's the same as that but it was
C	was er wasn't lightweight though
B	no it wasn't wasn't as light no
A	I saw it being advertised on the telly the other night and it was over two hundred pounds
B	two yeah
A	I mean I
B	I think they're head and shoulders above the rest
A	mm
B	they er they really are
C	yeah and we're we're really struggling to like between that oh do we buy one for the sake of having one? or do we
A	mm
C	hold out until we can afford a decent one that probably won't need replacing any time soon?
A	mm
C	cos that's that's kind of what's more important to us it's like
A	yeah
C	okay so we might have a lot of expenditure over the next
B	mm
C	twelve months while we effectively like set up the house but once it's set up as long as long as you've bought decent stuff
A	mm
B	it should be yeah
C	in the next five years you shouldn't have to replace anything
B	oh and we've got a microwave don't know if you know
C	microwave and
B	it's not it's
C	we've got a toaster on the way as well
B	yeah it wasn't a Panasonic they were a bit too expensive but it was on offer again at Currys
A	mm
C	a hundred and twenty quid
B	it's silver and
B	if you touch it it just leaves a smudge it's terrible
C	but it's a combination oven and it's got like a grill and everything as well you literally can do everything on there
B	it's huge
C	its even got a cake function which
B	huge
C	we've not been able to take advantage of that I can't work it
B	it's huge
C	but it's massive yeah
B	I'm just gonna keep saying it's huge
A	good
C	but we're getting there slowly but surely
C	well we've
B	oh no
C	and it's just it's just a really nice toaster and it that was on offer in Currys it had like twenty or thirty quid off
C	still fifty quid
A	mm
C	but in the grand scheme of things we're like ah well all the cheaper toasters are naff I can't eat anymore
A	mm
C	guest bed at the moment but as soon as one of us wears one
B	you don't wanna walk all the way upstairs mm
C	it's downstairs somewhere yeah so it's
A	mm
C	and all our shoes just keep gathering by the front door which just you just the
A	mm
C	and then after that like the house the house functions as it is now like to a certain extent like
B	we've no bins
C	still don't have any bins it's been nearly four weeks and we've not got bins
B	we asked the sales department and you emailed the erm council
C	I emailed the council last week basically saying the developers did say that they put in an order for this but we haven't received any bins yet so if you have received an order from them can you please expedite it so we have our bins soon
A	mm
C	or if you haven't received an order can you treat this as an order for bins
A	mm
C	but I haven't heard I haven't had a response and bins haven't turned up so
A	phone them up
C	yeah but
B	tell them we won't pay our council tax
C	it's not like they've tried to charge us council tax yet
B	they will
C	well it's just irritating like we're still having to like do midnight skip runs because we're embarrassed that we're binning all our stuff in the skip
C	you should've seen it this table and chairs right came in four separate boxes and I mean like giant boxes and er we were literally like how the hell do we get rid of all of this?
B	no it came in six boxes
C	did it?
B	two of them were the seats covers
C	oh yeah
A	you see you're not far from the tip are you? at
C	no
B	not really
A	just take your stuff round there
C	well that's what we decided we decided that if we couldn't bin them we'd just take them to the tip but
B	we've we've binned them
C	but we've binned them
C	well actually I spent ages cutting the boxes down like with a Stanley knife so I actually managed to get all of the boxes into two
B	but these
C	I mean yeah they they're they're the size of
A	mm
C	two chairs
A	mm
C	so they are big erm but we
A	so why don't they want you don't they want you
B	no they said we can but it's just embarrassing
C	they have yeah they I mean
A	no
B	yeah it is
C	they have said like
A	mm
C	obviously until the bins turn up we
A	mm
C	are taking advantage of having a skip on their doorstep but it is embarrassing like these boxes are so ridiculously big
B	erm no one else is doing that
C	they were
B	who?
C	both next door neighbours were when the skip was right opposite us
B	mm yeah
A	you er you are still
C	I know there's a
B	we're doing the survey
A	mm
C	Hamptons survey yeah but there's a couple of gripes so like the toilet in our en suite doesn't work and we're not
B	it does work
C	well it does work it doesn't flush properly
B	it does flush
C	oh but basically once you've flushed it it continually er
A	so it's on all the time
C	yeah
A	it
B	but all you have to do is go up to the back of it and just tap it again and then it it kind of flicks it back into just filling the tank at the back someone forgot to do that this morning someone else walked in to the en suite this evening and it was still trickling since this morning
C	anyway
B	that's a lot of water
C	and so apparently now we've got no outdoor water
B	the rain
C	yeah it's not it's not
A	connected water
C	it's not it's not us we're not spending a fortune on water but
C	not sure
B	yeah we'll have to look
C	but the back doors also stick not stick they erm
B	rub on the floor
C	yeah
B	they're about a millimetre or two too low
C	yeah
B	so when you're opening when you open one of them it it's a bit stiff and it's not very nice when you open the other one you can hear the plastic from where it goes down the door rubbing against the floor and then when you try and pull it up onto the frame where the metal is
C	it's horrible
B	it screeches
A	they need they need the the in the hinges
B	just to raise it slightly
A	it just
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but it er you know they need to do it
B	yeah
A	because they are
C	I know
A	the professionals so
C	we're just biding our time a little bit because we kicked up such a fuss about that outdoor light and they were actually they ended up being quite nice about fitting it cos they they didn't they weren't obliged to do it at all and from all accounts head office
B	and their head office yeah
C	basically told them not to do it we've been told not to mention it on the survey and stuff because
B	mm
C	they basically went against their orders
B	but they did bend over backwards in the end after a bit of a fight
C	yeah so
B	mm
C	I feel bad finding stuff
A	you can't live with it as it is cos you'll actually do you more damage opening the doors
C	I know
B	yeah
C	I know
A	and then you know
C	mm
A	or the replacement doors
B	yeah
C	did get a little mini win as well erm so I don't know if
A	mm
C	from all accounts
B	no he's spent a lot of money
C	well he has spent a lot
C	he is about to though as well he's booked him in for like a whole week in October
B	but it I think it was from he'd spent a lot of money and he'd made him a lot of money
A	mm
B	because people kept calling up and wanting to well people have been round to see the extension
A	yeah
B	and it's got
C	yeah
B	so as a favour he turned round and said er dad mentioned that we want the obviously the drive extended slightly and er the patio made a bit bigger and then
C	mm
B	the bit round the side done and
A	good
B	so that's amazing
C	yeah
A	that is good yeah
C	I don't we've we've kind of tested having both cars on the drive with one car pretty much up to the house and it's not quite long enough
A	no
B	you have one
C	you've got a very long car which doesn't help but even so you don't want to be right up to the house
A	mm yeah
B	no
C	so I think what's more likely is that we're gonna have to
C	make it slightly wider
A	wider
C	but it's just
A	mm
C	I don't wanna go I don't wanna go crazy wide but obviously I don't wanna go so tight that we can't get in and out of the cars so it's just trying we're gonna have to do some maths I think to try and work out
A	well what you would do is park one car forward facing and the other car
C	yeah
A	reversed so you're both getting out
B	I know we do well that's what we've done
C	yeah
B	we've my car goes at the front and I drive over the bump off the drive onto the grass and then we inch forward to about so my car bonnet is on the last slab cos obviously there's two slabs
A	mm
B	so my car bonnet will go up to there so you can just walk past
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
C	it's just it's just a little bit too short
B	slightly too
A	but but what I meant was when you go in widthwise
B	yeah oh sorry
A	if you extend it widthwise
B	yeah
A	and you wanna park next to each other
C	yeah
A	then one parks forward facing to the house
B	yeah
A	and
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	so you both drivers
B	oh yeah doors yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah and whoever
B	it's a horrible angle
C	yeah
C	or not but
A	you probably wanna wait until they've actually given you er a proper
C	I don't think they'll do
A	to the drive
C	I don't think they'll do the roads until they've finished the site
B	no
C	which could be another like twelve to eighteen months
A	so if
B	yeah
A	they probably have to give you a double riser
C	yeah they might they might do
B	we could well we could see about doing it ourselves
C	what? just putting tarmac down on the road
B	I don't know where I can get tarmac from
C	no I don't think you're allowed to do that erm but yeah so we have to do some sums basically and
A	mm
C	like even the ones even the ones to the right of us haven't really got a garden they've literally like obviously the ones next to us literally have that little bit that joins onto us
A	mm
C	but nothing else there is a proper garden so I know we've got a proper luxury there by having a nice front garden I don't wanna then ruin it by putting this huge driveway in
B	er if we do go wider I still wanna
C	yeah I know cos it looks stupid
B	it's just pointless
C	but we'll see we'll see
B	we need to find out what how much this the stuff costs anyway cos the stuff that our drive's made out of apparently is shipped in from Ireland so it's like specially made stones
C	great
C	yeah but everything seems to be expensive like
B	er yeah everything seems to be
C	although saying that I popped into Porcelanosa to like check out how much it would cost just to have those bathroom tiles and I was pleasantly surprised it was something like
B	twenty-eight pound a box no twenty-eight pound a metre
C	per square metre
B	per square metre
C	and I think we worked out that we'd need two square metres and that's with like leaving a lot of space for offcuts
C	and all that whatever you need to do so I'm thinking mm fifty quid sixty quid isn't really bad I know we add labour on top of that but can't really complain about that
A	thing is if you find if you find someone if you find a mate you know you can even ask
C	yeah
B	we we got someone to do the tiling at my er my mum and dad's tiling round the fire tiling in the porch
C	it's a weird one it doesn't really feel er
A	are you alright? has that really?
B	yeah
A	has it bothered you?
B	apparently so
C	I think everything bothers
B	oh yeah but I have
A	is it painful or just bubbly?
B	er a little bit of both it's slightly painful erm but the lunch I had this morning no today was the dinner we had from last night absolutely fine it's evening meals evening meals just bad
C	I don't even feel like that was a
A	no but er I just think I just think you're er
B	no
A	effectively do
A	cos if it's sitting there and you're putting more food on top
B	just sit and piles up yeah
C	yeah
A	it's it is just
A	waiting for a gap to come
B	it's weird
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so I'm actually hungry cos it's not made it down
C	that's just dangerous isn't it? that's what he said
A	mm
B	oh yeah
C	so erm
A	yeah
C	but I was gonna assume that we were welcome at Christmas
B	yeah
A	more than
B	I was gonna say er hopefully both both parents
A	I'm hopefully gonna have something in the bedroom by then
C	yeah that'd be good
B	so you can chuck
B	yeah need to work that out don't we?
C	yeah
A	yeah I definitely erm
C	would you would you be would you be in any way up for like a big Christmas celebration where like maybe me you and
A	mm yeah I don't mind
C	kind of feel like that would be like
B	yeah
C	best of both worlds cos then we get to spend the whole day with everyone
B	I'm cool with that
C	we'll see
B	yeah
B	what happened last Christmas? I know we hate we ate the er
C	I think because
B	I don't think they are this year
C	your parents were like don't come here so I think we spent Christmas here Boxing Day at mine and then we had
B	oh yeah
B	no wasn't it? oh right yeah I remember
C	or the Saturday even maybe I think it was like Wednesday was Christmas Day Thursday was Boxing Day then we had like a random just a Friday and then we had to
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
C	but
B	is he?
A	well it might be too much for your mum then cos she'll have
B	he's always
A	erm
B	er always at ours for Christmas always has been cos er growing up it was one set of grandparents would come on Christmas Day the other ones would come on Boxing Day and there'd be a switchover
A	mm
B	she'd like change the beds and stuff in the middle of it all
C	but it's something we can think about if not we'll do like a half day here and a half day there
B	yeah we'll enquire
C	yeah
B	is that a
A	yes
A	we found it in one of the bags in the garage and
A	I've used used the old
A	but he's quite happy with what he looks like so
B	do we do we say something?
A	no it it looks fine seriously
A	it does look fine it's just it is on the it's it it was done on the longest erm
B	setting mm
A	setting er and he was quite happy that he didn't have to pay a tenner to erm
B	I need mine cut
A	to have his hair cut so erm
B	short back and sides
C	what looks great about it?
B	you look like a big lion
B	with your mane
C	it just like it's just I mean it's calmed down now but you should've seen it first thing this morning it was like out here somewhere it was horrible
B	I like it
B	and you've had people comment on
A	mm
B	the colour of it
C	yeah everybody seems to like the colour
A	mm
C	I think it's because it does look ombré but because it is natural
A	mm
C	the line that you normally see when people have it done which makes it look fairly artificial
A	mm
C	you can't really see with mine it looks like a proper fade
A	mm
C	cos it is a proper fade
C	but I think the blonde blonde's just dyed
A	it is nice wahey
B	shake it
A	ah I thought she was already there
B	carpets and stuff
C	a bit nicer maybe
A	mm
C	so I'm seeing her on Saturday morning cos well we were faffing for ages and I was like look I'm really busy next week like weekend's really the only time I have time she's like oh well I need to go buy a microwave on Saturday if you wanna come with me?
C	I'm like if that's all you can give me I'll take it so I think I'm going with her to try and find a microwave slash washer dryer situation she wants to go and look in
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	why? you wanna go over
C	no
B	no
A	Currys isn't there
C	you wanna go to
C	the one that's across
A	erm
C	what? is is
B	I dunno if it's got a name
C	is it
A	it is the
B	yeah
A	yes
C	so I don't know
B	there's loads of sales
C	she's gonna come over to ours anyway so
A	yeah there's a there is a erm you know the Hotpoint depot?
C	yeah
A	in
C	yes
A	they they they sell
B	is that the one I drive past?
C	that's right near us yeah
A	yeah they sell er they sell fridges and washing machines and all the white goods stuff there
B	yeah
C	mm
A	they sell it they sell what they call seconds
C	yeah
A	you know it might have a dent in the door or something like that but it's pretty much
C	it works yeah
A	you know rock bottom erm at rock bottom price
C	well we'll see
A	but you er you kind of have to take it away with you on the day
C	yeah
B	if erm if you really wanted to just go somewhere you should just go to Argos
C	I know well she's coming cos I sort of said oh do you want me to meet you somewhere or do you wanna come to mine? and she was like oh I'll come to yours so I guess I can talk to her then about like oh have you thought about
A	mm
C	we weren't gonna do much this weekend anyway but I do wanna see
A	yeah
C	I've always kept one I've always
C	kept one hand in and now at the moment I feel like I don't even have that
A	but I think er
B	I dunno some of them are some of them are really
A	doing your own thing you you really don't want to still be in the circle of going out and
A	and
B	no er no some of
C	so they drove all the way to
C	and they'd already gone
B	and they'd already left to go out
A	that's bad
C	it's really bad
B	yeah
C	like that's that's the er that's the first and only time
A	mm
C	her very first housewarming do you know what I mean? and they weren't even there to like fully appreciate it
A	mm
C	so that's what like I'm really not that fussed about us having anything like that cos like
A	mm
C	they'd either blow it off or they'd come and then be like oh this is handy you're right in town
B	yeah
A	mm
C	so
B	and they went well no one not all of them but a lot of them went to Ibiza as well
C	yeah they've all come back from Ibiza
B	they're
C	they're
C	and I know she's really busy at work and stuff but like it's even at weekends and stuff she's not it's not like she's putting any time aside to come and see us
A	mm
C	so I'm just er I slightly resent that cos I made quite a big deal about like her moving into her house it's just not
B	we were there the day that she moved in
C	yeah just not really felt the same kind of
A	yeah
B	love
B	ah it's really weird I think your your girlfriends are always like that though
C	yeah
B	like if you're if you're in at the time whatever it is like
C	you're in it in it
B	there's er there's a lot of action and you're in it
A	mm
B	but if you drop off a little bit then they they just carry on and
A	yeah
B	they forget
C	but like I think
A	mm
C	who can't drive it's always you going to them so I've probably only seen her a handful of times since Christmas and every single time it's been me going to her
A	mm
C	like
A	she's
C	I know but she's been so busy with the house stuff erm but this is what I mean like everybody's got their own stuff going on which is fine but when it's constantly you going oh can we meet up?
A	mm
C	like
A	mm
C	I've made the effort to come to you I haven't seen you in ages and now
A	yeah
C	you're blowing me off to like go and see someone or something that you see all the time
A	mm
C	it's really annoying so that's what's kind of I think that's what's got on my nerves cos I just feel like it's constantly me and even it's kind of the same with the girls from uni like they all live in
A	mm
A	mm
C	carry on with the rest of the week
A	mm
C	like that's just such a big ask and I was like
A	mm
A	mm
C	and then I
A	mm yeah
C	and it's like they all know I've just moved into a house and not a single one of them's made the effort none like none of them have rang me to be like oh so how's it going? none of them have said oh can we come and visit?
A	mm
C	so it's just like
A	mm
C	I don't wanna be needy I don't wanna be the one going oh when are you gonna come and see me?
A	mm
C	and I then don't also wanna make it feel like they're constantly coming to me but it's not like they're constantly coming to me
A	mm
C	and er I almost feel like me making one journey to
A	mm
C	do I have to go five times to
A	mm
C	there's five of them in
A	mm
C	and just trying to coordinate cos like a couple of them seem to like only wanna do stuff when there's a big group of us and it's like it's so hard to coordinate six people who have very separate very busy lives like
A	mm
C	it'd be fairly easy me for me to probably text
A	yeah
C	it's fairly easy for me to text her and she'll say yes or no but if I text all of them it's like some people'll be like yes some people'll say no of those that say yes some people'll be free in the morning some people'll be free in the afternoon and before you know it you're running round headless trying to accommodate everybody else when actually you're the one making the effort to go down there so everybody should be accommodating you
A	mm
C	so it's a tough one I had a really nice time when I went down in April but it's not cheap like
A	mm
C	costs me twenty quid on the train for starters and then if we eat out and we have like I think last time we I had the train to pay for we didn't really do much in the day but we had breakfast at
A	mm
C	but like even a couple of bottles of wine between us was another fifteen twenty quid
A	mm
C	and then we had dinner on top of that I think I spent one day in
A	mm
C	that's a huge commitment when I don't have a lot of like disposable income
A	yeah
C	I can't do that very often
A	mm
C	and they just don't seem to appreciate that and actually it's quite a big undertaking to say ah well of my weekend I'm gonna spend the whole day on Saturday going to
A	yeah yeah
C	so I don't know I'm feeling a bit like
A	yeah
C	a bit left out of stuff at the moment and a bit
A	it is
C	and it's
A	yeah
C	but oh well
A	yeah it's just everybody's gonna be at different stages in their
C	yeah
A	lifetime
C	it's
A	yeah
C	for them their number one priority is their job like
A	mm
C	that's what they're pouring their heart and soul into is their job and they're working all the hours under the sun and they're making huge sacrifices to be able to do whatever it is that they're doing and they're loving it and that's great that's that's fab but they're sacrificing a hell of a lot to do it they're they're not they don't have a lot of personal time they certainly don't get a lot of time to do a lot of stuff in the evening they're paying a lot for the lifestyle to live in
A	mm
C	and I don't have a lot in common with that cos
A	mm
C	I'm very happy where I am but it's still a means to an end for me like
A	mm
C	I go to work so that I can afford to do the other things that I like to do
A	yeah
C	in my life
A	mm
C	and er it is it's
A	mm
C	whatever else that actually
A	mm
C	makes me happy so for me it's weird to think of a life that literally revolved around work
A	mm
C	and for them the concept of owning a house is so kind of out of their reach in the
A	mm
C	short-term because house prices there are so ridiculous it's not even on their radar
A	yeah
C	so I think to a certain extent a lot of them are quite freaked out by the fact that I've made such a commitment so young
A	mm
C	because it's just not something that they've even considered
A	they can do mm
C	yeah so I don't I don't know if there's maybe a pang of even jealousy there
A	mm
C	cos I know a couple of them made comments about the fact you know they're they're not gonna be owning a house anytime soon and I'm like well it is one of the it's another sacrifice that you make to work in
A	and everybody everybody really you know you just have your own goals don't you? and you do reach a point in life and career and whatever that you're gonna go this way or that way and it it usually is job or
C	job or like home life effectively yeah
A	family-centred
C	I just don't I at the moment am struggling to see a job that I could love so much that I would be prepared to like put it first
A	yeah
C	cos I just get so much more satisfaction from my relationships from my friends
A	mm
C	from my family
A	mm
C	from going to work
A	yeah
C	so I I think I find it hard to communicate with them on that level as well cos we have got very different lifestyles
A	mm
B	hello
C	hello
A	alright?
B	mm
A	do you need another drink?
B	BBC News
C	BBC News a woman who had erm a five thousand
B	three foot wasps' nest in her house
A	oh
C	three three foot wasps'
B	in her house
A	oh
C	yeah
B	so it had been there for at least three months and had five thousand wasps in it
A	oh good lord
B	and the guy that
C	yeah he they'd they'd basically it there was like a picture of this bed crocheted like er
B	just a big mound yeah
C	a big mound and erm the guy said that these wasps had like eaten through the mattress and through the pillows and stuff to make their nest bigger so this nest was like fully integrated into this bed he said that he had to go back through and shut the door cos obviously it would've been really dangerous if the wasps got into the er house but there was like five thousand odd he said it's the biggest thing he's ever seen
A	mm
C	so dangerous this woman like it didn't really say much about the woman
B	no
C	so I don't know if she was elderly or what but
B	it was really obscure wasn't it?
C	it was just like oh yeah er like the only quote I think they had from her was like the the the this room was just unused and it hadn't been hadn't been gone into but I'm like who doesn't go into a room in their house for three months?
B	who wouldn't hear a wasps' nest that big?
C	I know
A	yes er how do they come and go?
B	oh is it the window had been left ajar?
C	oh yeah one of like
C	a small window had been left slightly open
B	but that's all they need
C	yeah
A	well it is all they need and it just
B	yeah
A	that's that's how they actually get into the loft spaces isn't it?
B	lofts yeah
C	yeah
A	they er they kind of get er under the eaves and erm
B	find a tiny hole
A	can usually
C	but it literally made my scrin my scrin craw my
A	yeah
C	that's just horrible
A	yes
C	so yeah don't don't don't don't check your spare room
A	no well no
B	D D D D D
C	D D D don't don't not check
B	D D D
A	actually
B	yeah
C	I don't know if I like my room being called a spare room
A	it took a bit of cleaning around the windows
B	oh yeah?
C	oh yeah it was pretty gross
B	someone opened their jewellery bag onto our bed and it was filthy covered full of like
C	you know those little like black bugs that were around
B	thunder mites
A	mm
C	thunder bug type things
B	thunder yeah thunder
C	so I literally tipped like my bag of jewellery out onto the bed and there was just these black bugs everywhere I was like oh that's so gross
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
B	is it just clean a clean empty room now?
C	have you painted it yet?
A	no er tried got the stuff ready so erm just waiting for
C	mm
A	he's
C	how does he do that?
A	I just don't know he said to me on Friday wake me up when you get up tomorrow and I'll make a start on it so I did and then every hour after that
A	and eventually got up at two o'clock he said oh I might do it tomorrow the weather's gonna be bad tomorrow so then Sunday I woke him up at eleven thought that was a reasonable time and I think I left at one o'clock to go and meet
B	absolute lad
A	he probably is up during the night to watch er movies or stuff
B	well I used to do that so I can't say anything
C	yeah we're on slightly
C	different patterns at the moment like
A	mm
C	yeah
B	quarter to eight
C	so
A	mm
C	when I'm trying to get him to come to bed at like half past ten he's not tired in the slightest
A	mm
B	I get tired at eleven but you're already fast asleep
A	yeah
B	but
C	but like last night I was up yesterday morning six half past six whatever had a really long day then I had
A	mm
C	half past eleven but
A	mm
C	that meant I couldn't get up I wouldn't have been able to get up this morning at six
A	mm mm
C	it's hard hard trying to find the balance
A	yeah
B	yeah er
A	I can imagine
B	it's also weird for me to be woken up at six
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	and then I get woken up by my alarm
A	mm
B	so we need to find an in-between today was nice today was so much better for me
C	he likes having me there in the morning which is fine and
B	yeah
C	in all fairness like I left at nine o'clock this morning and I was in for quarter to ten
A	mm
C	and I left at half past five and managed to avoid I think some fairly long traffic but I still was home for half past six
A	mm
C	which isn't the worst thing in the world
A	no
C	like that's not too late especially if he could get home and start making dinner
B	and er I as you say I was already home and I I could've started cooking
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I imagine
A	school will start back next week
B	yeah
C	I imagine going forward I might have to adopt a late start because the early start getting on the road at seven I do still hit congestion and so it's not a very nice drive and you'd think leaving at half past three it would it would always be a cruise home but it's not always a cruise home even at half past three so it's like it's
B	you've left a few times recently
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and been in
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	so it's like there aren't there aren't that many perks to going in early other than I like the way my day forms so like if I start work at eight
A	yeah
C	and don't have lunch till one I've done the biggest part of my day before I've even had lunch
A	mm
C	so after lunch I've only got a couple of hours left to work
A	mm
C	which is much nicer than having like the biggest part of the day after lunch that being said like I think as as winter draws in I think I will find it harder and harder to get up early when it's like cold and not very nice and it's not very nice waking up on your own
A	yeah
C	when he's still in bed and stuff so I imagine moving forward I probably will work lates cos
A	mm
C	it's one of those things as well like obviously as the nights draw in you're doing less and less in the evening anyway so there's no real need for me to rush home
A	mm no
C	cos that's what I find er
A	and also the weather earlier in the morning the roads aren't
C	it's dangerous
A	quite as er
C	yeah
A	de-iced and whatever
C	I just
C	I just think I get home
A	mm
C	like even like yesterday it didn't make much of a difference cos I had
B	at least yeah
C	er to at least
A	mm
C	to start thinking about dinner or whatever
B	so I don't get
C	yeah
B	quarter past six
C	so my day isn't er like you know like er
A	mm
A	yeah
C	but I can't eat early because I'm still kind of
B	and I can't get off or on
C	no
A	mm
C	you will like minimum
B	for at least half a hour just
C	yeah you'd be lucky to get home for half past five
B	the the
C	so
A	mm
C	earlies doesn't have that many advantages to be honest so I think
A	yeah
B	I think when the
C	slip road
B	slip road getting onto it
C	yeah
A	mm
B	because you can't get off the estate for twenty twenty-five minutes
A	mm
B	if you leave bang on five by the time you've got to your car
A	yeah
B	they're queuing up the road past
A	mm
B	past where you used to work
C	yeah
B	and they're queuing right round mine until er until
A	yeah
A	it's not a nice er situation is it?
B	mm
C	no I'll er I'll have to find something like this this week I have been doing earlies and it it does help to get into a routine I E go in at the same time every day
B	mm
C	erm
A	yeah
B	you should stick with it for the rest of the week
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and then you can just choose it again
C	it's er it's actually easier to start off the week earlies and then if I get tired towards the end of the week switch to lates it's easier to do that because effectively like last night for example I got in at half past four I didn't go er I didn't leave the house till nine so you get like a nice rest it's easier to do that than to do lates and then
A	mm
C	try and switch onto earlies because
A	yeah
C	you're getting home at like half past six and then you're leaving
B	you don't switch
C	at half past six
A	mm
C	so it's like I'm literally in the house for twelve hours which is just a bit depressing
A	mm
C	so yeah you have to find
A	mm
C	it at the moment at the moment earlies are okay they serve a purpose because like I've had to be home for stuff if if I'm hosting if I'm expecting people to come over I'd much prefer to be home when so they can come over as soon as they've
A	mm
C	finished work than expecting them to hang around town till like
A	yeah
C	half past six or whatever erm
B	but you don't wanna be lonely do you?
C	no and I don't like the mornings are tough like
A	mm
C	and I'd I don't really look after myself as much in the mornings I'll literally like maybe get up at half past six and try and be out of the house for like ten to seven seven o'clock
A	mm
C	so all I literally do is splash my face and get dressed and head out so I'm not even like waking myself up properly before I go I'm not having breakfast until I get to work
A	mm
C	so it's like actually this morning was so lovely cos I actually took my time getting up I had a proper
A	mm
C	washed my hair and everything got dressed
B	sat down
C	sat down and had breakfast with
A	mm
C	and headed off and I have like a proper like I guess hour-and-a-half
A	mm
C	of like just getting ready and taking my time and eating my breakfast
A	mm
C	and just waking up
A	mm
C	so by the time I was in the car I was like I was ready to start my day properly
A	yes yeah
C	and actually today was really nice I I forced well I think this is what I'm gonna have to do I forced myself to wait until half past one for my lunch so I did three-and-a-half hours half an hour lunch three-and-a-half hours which feels nice like
A	mm
C	that I can do
A	yeah
C	what I've found is sometimes when I do lates I somehow like I struggle to get going a little bit because like
A	mm
C	everybody's already in their full flow when I get into work and I feel like I'm a bit behind
A	yeah
C	and then because it's ten o'clock already you almost feel like you get into this false state of saying to yourself oh well er it's only a few hours until lunch so what I found myself doing is being a bit bored and then going on an early lunch at say like twelve half twelve when I really didn't need to
A	mm mm
C	and so I'd come back and I'd have like four-and-a-half hours left to work and you're just like that's actually a bit
A	mm
C	depressing like that's a long time to still be working
A	yeah
C	I don't know er I'll find er
C	I'll find a rhythm with it at some point I think I've
A	mm
C	so I'm knackered just from the fact that I've not really had
A	yes
C	any like it's the whole house moving thing you know if I had proper holiday to use
A	mm
C	I'd've taken the time off when we moved and I'd've actually like spent a few days just getting the house the way I wanted it but instead I had a weekend where we were trying to do everything rushed
A	mm
C	then went back to work and then every weekend since it's been trying to do odd jobs because
A	mm
C	I don't have the time to do it in the week
A	mm
C	and like
A	mm
C	and I just think
C	yeah I just think
A	mm
C	oh it's like like I'm gonna have to deal with the fact that he's got those days that I haven't got
A	mm
C	so there's gonna be at least a week-and-a-half when I've like got to go to work and he doesn't which is just and I'm knackered
A	yeah mm
C	erm
A	and when does your leave year start?
C	January to January so it's fine like and er the thing is
A	mm
C	I got er
A	mm
B	but four of it four days
C	but four of it had to be allocated to Christmas so
A	mm
C	immediately I had like less anyway and then it just so happened that we'd already booked that week as holiday basically a couple of weeks into me starting
A	mm
C	so that was a massive chunk straightaway gone
A	yeah yeah
C	so it's just
A	let's go and have a seat in there for a while
B	yeah
C	yeah
