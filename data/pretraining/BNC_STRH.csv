A	so just kicking off uh second half
A	uh
B	are you just
A	yeah
B	oh you're not gonna commentate the whole match are you? I don't think I'd like to be a sports commentator
A	uh uh I don't know any of the players so uh I can't really
B	you could just make up names for them
A	um could just say the teams like Cardiff has it in this uh
B	yeah that's
A	yeah
B	I like the
A	uh uh over to Crystal Palace now
B	which kit  which kit  d'you prefer? Like I like that custardy sort of colour
A	uh
A	yeah well I think that some of the kits that they have um could be more  could be more  extravagant I suppose um
B	yeah
A	but they must think that it's uh that it's off-putting to have really bright bits or
B	yeah like
A	or it's not you know it's not masculine enough to have um pink kits so I don't  I don't  know any teams that have a pink kit
B	I'm
A	um I don't know
B	maybe it wasn't them
A	I think Northampton Town has a purple
B	oh do they?
A	but uh
B	oh that'd be good
A	um
B	also I think like there's a lot of stripes on the go
A	yeah they don't have they don't really have spotty ones but but I think that would be it like sort of distracting with the  with the  ball wouldn't it?
B	you know like jockeys have
A	uh
B	or like um
A	animal patterns or
B	animal animal patterns
A	yeah I suppose you could uh
A	well yeah cos
B	oh yeah that's a good idea
A	uh
B	like rugby league does that though don't they?
A	so could be like like the Cowboys and and the Indians or something and
B	yeah
A	like the
B	well I saw like you know  you know  I've been knitting stuff and that at the minute
A	yeah
B	for uh the baby
A	yeah
B	but it looked like a baby tuxedo
B	but it was just a jumper
A	well people
B	yeah
A	uh
B	but they dress them as like big pumpkins and stuff don't they? On Halloween
A	I can see how uh you know you might wanna
B	yeah
A	you could sort of imitate like like a football kit I suppose you could knit a football  a football  shirt and
B	yeah you could
A	uh or
B	you could do
A	I'm not
B	maybe
B	Cos they're all that horrible sort of nylon aren't they? Is it nylon
A	for for babies that have grown up supporting Everton or something and they would have like Everton woolly jumper or something
A	uh for for uh Southampton or
B	not Southampton
A	and uh
B	uh
A	I mean yeah the colours could be  could be  more extravagant
B	like you know like jockeys have?
A	uh
B	like where they have like a
A	well they have yeah they have more crazy
B	and like you know like even rugby does like even rugby has the that kind of
A	or like the Harlequins that they I like  I like  their one that's got sort of four bits
B	although
A	yeah and Celtic as well
B	oh yeah
A	um
B	that's probably about the limits of my footballing knowledge
A	there is too much there's too much just red white red white sort of
B	nothing wrong with red and white
A	yeah well sport is good to watch uh especially in the pub and uh
B	yeah
A	but also if you get into it you could get quite you know become engrossed in it and and sort of
B	I think so
B	yeah
A	when the
B	are you looking forward to the Olympics?
A	um
B	yeah
A	I suppose you can't just turn up and then and just go and watch it
B	well
A	yeah
B	or the outdoor ones like the road races but no
A	hm uh they don't do tiddlywinks do they?
B	no
A	but um
B	no I didn't get any tickets
A	they they do some strange things like like archery and uh
B	beach volleyball in London
A	yeah
B	I quite liked the swimming ones last time
A	cycling uh uh we did win a lot of cycling uh
B	oh yeah
A	well it's pretty quick
B	it's a bit sort of muh sort of everyone likes it but
A	do they?
B	well that's like the most expensive tickets were for that
A	yeah
B	the men's one hundred metre final
A	how much would it cost you to watch the men's a hundred metre final?
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	um but for a lot of them like
A	ooh there's Chris Martin
B	who's Chris Martin
A	plays for Crystal Palace
A	no it's cos he he's a singer he's a he's um
B	oh Chris Martin Chris Martin
A	he uh used to be  used to be
A	yeah
B	well a change of pace
A	um he was always
B	yeah
A	oh is he going through the Bible? The next thing's gonna be like Den or something
B	oh you mean apple
A	dirty Den
B	den?
A	yeah from um Daniel in the lion's den
B	ah right
A	apple from Adam and Eve and the apple um
B	yeah
A	Moses from the Moses
B	the story of Moses
A	Moses' adventures
B	I don't know if Apple was a very
A	I think Apple is
B	like what? Like pawpaw
A	well it's better than many fruits I think
B	Mango Martin's got a nice ring to it
A	Mango yeah I think it's like
B	Mango Martin?
A	it's it's man and go isn't it so it's you know
B	yeah
A	it means  it means  something
B	or Mushroom? Mushroom Martin
A	um
B	that's quite nice
A	uh
B	oh yeah
A	um
B	but so I think instead of like Moses he should've just gone for Basket like Moses' basket you know? Apple and Basket
A	uh
B	I don't know if Commandment would be a nice name for a person
A	the plagues um?
B	buboes
A	uh
B	that's the wrong sort of plague
A	I don't know if that was uh
B	that's the Black Death
A	the the the locusts and uh
B	locust
B	um
A	um
B	no
A	actually
B	it certainly is
