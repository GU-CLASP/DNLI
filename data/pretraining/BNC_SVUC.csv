A	they normally give you a whole pile of these and ask you to deliver them?
B	no she doesn't no
C	she's a lovely little lady
B	oh she's a lovely old gal and
C	and all we talk about is the garden
B	mm
C	well I didn't see her this time did I?
B	no religion
B	she doesn't talk about religion does she?
A	where does she come from?
C	well yeah
B	I don't know where she comes she comes around with this young young girl
A	oh I see in a car
B	who's pretty
A	what used to annoy me about these was that you know they used to come round and they would have like an old lady a young girl with a kid you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	sort of a family thing
C	so you can't
A	so these
B	but we give her time I mean she's she's such a nice old girl and she come round and she just says what's in you might like to read that bit there and and I say yeah yeah and then she said oh your garden looks beautiful and I said thank you very much and she's a very nice
C	and she always asks about the family cos she
B	you know cos she yeah she asks about
C	she's been coming for year absolutely years
B	mm
C	she always remembers doesn't she?
B	yeah she's lovely
C	yeah and and the girl that's with her she's nice too
B	but when the Mormons come round we don't like that
A	see whatever happened to discipline in recent decades family life in Western lands has changed dramatically at one time parents were in charge and children followed their lead now in some households it seems to be the other way around for example consider the following scenarios all of which are based on typical
C	yeah
A	it's nothing to do with religion is it?
C	no
A	you know? but I tell you and sort of a hankering a hankering after what's that?
B	I have to have a china one I can't stand them stoneware
A	oh dear
B	I'm sorry but that's how it is
C	not bad is it?
B	cos you scrape that that's fine but scrape that with a knife er
A	that's horrible
B	see how horrible it is
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	right these are cheese ordinary cheese and they're cream cheese
A	oh right yeah well
C	and Marmite in case you don't like Marmite
A	oh then this thing goes on after goes through all the instances and stuff and it comes to the
B	a good thumping
A	er?
B	a good thumping
A	spare the rod and spoil the child
C	oh terrible innit?
C	mm
B	we never did hit ours did we? didn't have to did we?
A	I only ever hit
B	yeah
A	when she was a teenager
B	mm
A	but she was oh
B	bit naughty was she?
A	yeah
C	it's probably more teenage time isn't it? you think about it than than
A	yeah well when they're young it's pointless hitting a child
C	yeah
B	mm
C	explain everything that's all
B	when they did when they did something wrong we used to say well that's silly wasn't it? we don't really do that do we? and they'd go oh no sorry
C	yeah
B	and that was it
A	but there again most
B	no
C	no
A	you know so you don't punish them and then
C	no they don't understand
A	they get to the stage where they're sort of like mucking about and being cheeky and you can't you can't you know there's nothing wrong with that
B	no
A	and then after a while when they're sort of teenagers you sort of think well you know I did that when I was a teenager so
C	mm
A	well I was
B	you do
A	no this is fine
C	no we've been lucky with ours anyway they've always
B	we have
C	yeah we have
A	but it's
C	it's a
B	nineteen granddaughter nineteen
A	really?
B	yeah
C	mm that's scary
A	well my sister is two years older than me has got great children who are who are
C	oh really?
A	seven and eight
B	what?
C	no? seven and eight
A	well seven or eight you know
B	yeah
A	there's one boy who's seven or eight and then she's got younger ones
C	oh sorry gosh wow
A	and she had children when she was eighteen
B	yeah
A	and then her daughter couldn't have been more than twenty when she had kids
B	right
A	that kid then had a daughter had children when she was sort of seventeen or eighteen
C	mm
B	yeah well it's how it happens innit?
A	and the funny thing is you sort of think of this is sort of typical brainless you know sort of you know idiots who
B	yeah
A	but they're all intelligent people
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	like my sister was I think she was sort of fairly desperate to get away from home
C	right
A	and er you know she had two kids by the time she was nineteen
B	did she?
C	yeah
A	lived in a caravan with no electric no hot water
C	oh gosh that's hard mm
A	yeah yeah but when you're nineteen you know
C	yeah but with little ones
A	yeah
C	mm
A	they had a wood burner in the caravan you know?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but then by the time she was you know three years down the
C	yeah really?
A	mm brought the kids up on her own
C	yeah
B	this is why I'm against weddings
B	I mean you get your kids like say well
C	you can't tell can you?
B	she said er I'm going to get married mum and dad yeah okay it's only going to cost ten thousand pound no it isn't didn't we?
C	mm
A	you didn't say oh well where are you going to get that from?
B	we should have you know? but these parents spent an awful lot of money on on weddings
A	mm
B	and then it all erm and
A	yeah
C	mm
B	you know and go on people don't think of being married as for life any more
A	no
B	they just think they get well they they think it's for life when they start and then a couple of years down the line they go er I'm fed up with this
A	but er but even so I mean it is probably the exception more than the rule that a couple such as yourself stay together over I mean you get I mean I'm you know like not with er
B	no
B	that's right yeah
A	cos I mean okay I spent twenty odd years you know
B	yeah
A	and then you've still got another twenty odd years to go or whatever
C	yeah
A	or more
C	yeah
A	I was thinking the other day that it's getting to the stage where me and
C	right mm
A	well or not you know
C	twenty-one gosh really?
A	yeah
C	wow
A	yeah must be
C	yeah it must be
A	twenty-one years me and
B	yeah
A	which is like quite good going
C	mm
A	you know
C	it is
B	I remember the day you took her out all the the time
B	we were talking about it the other day
A	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah that's quite a while ago
C	it's oh that's like a lifetime ago innit? really
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's the same with
A	see that must be about you know cos like
B	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah must have been you know and you sort of you know and you know I think she was only she was with
B	yeah funny innit?
A	mm like you say you know people get married now
C	yeah
A	quite often they'll last a couple of years
B	it's a shame really cos
C	mm
B	it isn't what it used to be but
A	they get hung up with the idea of a new party don't they?
B	they do yeah when I was a kid though I mean ten eleven years old we had a the big open space at
A	mm
B	with an American and she come back several months later no child that had been taken away and put up for adoption and other one that lived just up the road from us and exactly the same thing happen she disappeared this is this is in the what was it? ten in the fifties late late mid mid to late fifties and that's what happened people became pregnant and everything got put up for adoption you weren't allowed em if you were a single mum
A	weren't allowed em
B	well that's what it seemed like
A	well the thing is it was very difficult for a single person you know someone who wasn't married to you know to bring up a child
B	no
A	that was why most children in that position was brought up by the parents as their children weren't they?
B	yeah
C	mm yeah
B	yeah
A	you know there's an awful lot of that went on
C	they were weren't they yeah?
A	you know say oh that's your that's your sister no well actually it's my daughter
C	mm
B	I remember by neighbours got one yeah you know just one one house away she come round to me and she said I'm pregnant and I said oh yeah okay can you do anything about it? do you know anyone?
C	to you?
B	yeah
C	wow
B	and I said no and I was telling one of the my friends at work
C	strange person to go to wasn't it?
B	yeah but I was telling one of my friends at work he was fifty-nine at the time and I was only about seventeen eighteen sixteen seventeen eighteen something like that and he said I'll do it oh and I daren't I daren't say anything so I didn't didn't tell anybody that you're the first people I've ever told this
A	mm dear oh dear
B	yeah
A	before the days of the pill hey?
B	he was a hairdresser
A	oh my
C	yeah
B	it doesn't he did tell us a funny story once though
B	it was a funny story I have to say
B	he said er when he was a hairdresser cos he was a he was an engineer when when I was working when he was a hairdresser he said I had this bloke come in and he sat down and he said
C	mm
B	said hold your head back and he went like that with the back of the cut throat and the bloke went ah he really thought he'd cut his throat
B	told you that story haven't I?
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	is this your daily spoonful of peanut butter?
C	yeah my daily spoonful mm
A	I buy that peanut butter with sort or er crunchy bits in it
C	mm this crunchy one it's
A	no no no no
C	what one with honey?
A	with the honey crunch
C	yeah
A	it's like the inside of er what were them chocolate bars you used to get what with honey crunch inside
B	oh yeah
C	oh yeah
B	erm erm
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
C	no just Crunchy bars
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah we bought that
B	yeah
C	yeah in Morrison's
A	but I quite like that
C	mm well it's a bit sweet isn't it?
A	yeah
C	but it you've got to think of it as something different
A	that's right sort of
C	mm
A	that's like in America they have peanut butter and jam don't they
C	mm
A	mixed
C	yeah
A	so are you going to vote next weekend?
B	oh god
C	you have to both don't you? one way or the other you got to do something
B	it's very difficult now to know
A	how far do you got to go?
B	just up the road to the polling station up erm
C	yeah
A	oh right
B	mm
A	you have to drive down there?
C	yeah
B	we might walk if it's nice but
C	we'll probably drive
B	yeah
A	no
C	no
B	I mean why can't they say what they want to do with all honesty and the other people say what they want to so with all honesty instead of saying they're wrong and they're and and all this bickering and nastiness that just make you want to blow the lot up
A	as far as I can make out like all parties are gonna reduce taxation
C	mm
B	yeah
A	they're going to reduce the deficit
B	yeah
A	put more money into teaching and the hospitals
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and er everyone's gonna to be fine
B	yeah
A	you know they're all going to do it you know some are going to do it a bit more than others
B	yeah
A	and you think well that's a bloody lie
B	yeah
A	straightforward you know
B	yeah
A	cos like it's a bare faced like you know going through historical records you know sort of you know it says that every government within three months of them being elected have always put up taxes
B	yeah
A	always it always happens and you know they might sort of disguise it you know like the conservatives
B	that's like with VAT wasn't it?
A	yeah the conservatives rank five
C	isn't that silly? fifteen percent isn't it?
A	what?
C	went down to fifteen percent and
A	it was fifteen
C	and everyone had to change their
A	and now it's now twenty
B	it's not twenty twenty percent on anything you buy
A	that's right
B	you know other than food
A	yeah
C	but it's all this change thing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	well it was seventeen and a half percent
C	mm
A	then it went down to fifteen
C	yeah
A	and then but as soon as the conservatives come in bang twenty percent
C	yeah
B	and fuel used to be no VAT on it and when the Tories come in they put eight percent on it
A	did they? oh yeah that's right they did
B	yeah
A	that was before this
B	everybody have to have fuel everybody everybody the old people everyone
A	well they'll put it on food next VAT on food won't they?
B	well they've got it on fizzy drinks haven't they?
A	yeah well they've got it on erm what they call erm sort of non-essentials
B	non-essentials yeah
C	mm
A	yeah I mean you can bet your life I mean they're going to they say oh we won't we'll make a pledge we won't put up the income tax we won't put up something else and we won't or national insurance and we won't put up something else so you think well that's council tax going to rise for a start cos they didn't mention that
B	yeah
A	but they've got to get the money from somewhere
B	course they have yeah
A	and that'll be the next thing they'll revalue or have a revaluation of council tax
B	well they got to really haven't they?
A	and er the thing about revaluation all it is I mean they shouldn't it shouldn't make any difference to how much you pay unless you know you're living in a house which was undervalued
B	yeah
A	cos it should be the same but it doesn't work like that does it?
B	no
A	like everyone then suddenly starts paying fifty quid a year more
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know some people get stung with extra
B	yeah yeah that's totally wrong
A	yeah and such
C	they have that was it poll tax?
B	it used to be poll tax
C	individual people wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	only a hundred pound
B	that was in
C	yeah but that's how it was and everyone moaned and moaned about it and then they went back to housing tax
B	yeah
A	well that's right
C	or whatever they call council tax now
A	council tax I mean they use
C	and they keep
A	it used to be like your council or what they called
B	rates
A	the rates used to be about you know two hundred and fifty quid a year
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	and then conservatives said oh no well we got to change that to like eight hundred quid a year
B	yeah
A	and they put up VAT from fifteen to seventeen and a half percent at the same time
B	they did yeah
A	to pay for the difference so you ended up paying a fortune
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah I think it was worked out long long ago I can't remember that if you actually spend one pound I think ninety percent of that one pound is taxed in one way or another
A	yeah I'm sure it is cos I mean you pay income tax for a start before you start spending
B	that's right yeah
B	then you pay twenty percent on your if if you went and bought a bottle of pop
A	mm
B	and that's that's twenty percent more you know?
A	yeah yeah
B	and a bottle of pop costs you about fifty pence more
A	but you see you wouldn't you wouldn't you know be so worried about you know paying for it you know tax if that was used in a proper manner
B	yeah
A	everyone needs you know like infrastructure don't they?
B	yeah
A	like roads being built people are quick enough to moan when there's potholes and stuff but someone's got to pay for it
B	yeah
C	yeah and that's only fair
B	so this is what road tax was about wasn't it?
A	well it started off that way
B	yeah
A	it isn't like that any more
B	not any more no
A	just goes into the the general exchequer but I mean you know that's happens so often but then you know they're talking about a thousand billion pounds
B	yeah
A	is what
B	and we are
A	and they say they say well it's not much it's over twenty years so it's only whatever it is so many billion a year and you think well what
B	we already owe over a trillion
A	but what you could do with all that money
C	mm
B	yeah
A	if
B	look at the hospitals and schools you could have for a start
A	well that's right and they
B	and the nurses and doctors
A	on a as a much lower level it's a high-speed two railway line
B	oh yeah
A	that's got a projected cost of four billion or something
B	that's right yeah
C	yeah
A	and you think gosh if that money if that was spent differently
C	mm
B	yeah
C	we don't need that do we?
B	yeah no why would I want to get from London to Birmingham in in three minutes or something stupid
C	it's not needed
A	but they then they say about housing they say well you know it's the cost of land you think well they put that railway line in they think nothing about compulsory purchase on the land
B	no
A	and they'll be paying like you know agricultural rates for it
B	that's right yeah
A	why they can't use that money to buy compulsory purchase land for housing
B	yeah
A	cos you build a house I mean a hundred and fifty thousand of it is the cost of the plot innit?
B	yeah it is yeah
A	you know so you can't build cheap houses if you're starting off
B	no
A	but then if the council's bought the land cheap you know so they plot is only you know if you call it agriculture land what is it three thousand and acre or something
B	yeah
A	or five thousand an acre
B	yeah
A	and you split that up into plots each plot is only going to cost you a few hundred quid innit?
B	yeah
A	so if they started off with a few hundred quid rather than a hundred and fifty thousand
B	that's right yeah
A	for a plot the house comes out
C	yeah yeah
A	you know that much cheaper
B	yeah if you think how much a plot is now and how much a plot is when our parents bought their house
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	land was next to nothing
A	well that's right yeah but I mean you know I mean
B	I know it's all relevant but I mean they had enough money then to buy
A	yeah but I mean it's not
A	but yeah but I mean in those days it was still cheap compared to how much people earned than it is nowadays I mean not the the cost of housing sort of escalated way above the cost of earnings
B	mm
C	mm
B	in
A	are you going to eat that?
B	no that's for you
A	is it? oh well well I'm sure I've had more than
B	that's why I left it there
A	I had more than my fair share you know these
C	yeah you always get the last one don't you?
A	you're always a bit hesitating to
B	yeah
A	anyway yeah go on this building
B	yeah this building at
A	mm
B	and they built what is now a great big estate on it and their houses were selling for something like five hundred and fifty-two thousand pound between five hundred and a thousand pound each and now those houses are worth cos they've all got gardens
A	mm
B	cos they used to have gardens when they built houses now there's no no garden at all cos they just build flats and stuff don't they?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	that's why it's these ex council houses are such a good buy
B	they're a fantastic buy
A	cos they all had big garden's didn't they?
B	yeah
A	cos they expected people to have a vegetable plot
B	yeah
C	mm
B	cheaper
A	and
B	yeah
A	and all that stuff
B	yeah
A	and some of them council estates especially out in the countryside are absolutely you know
B	they've got massive gardens
A	they've got massive great houses as well
B	yeah massive gardens
A	and sort of like big three bedroom houses
C	four bedroom houses
B	beautiful houses they are yeah?
C	yeah they're lovely
B	we where do we usually go past them lovely houses with the with the double roof type thing like
C	yeah it begins with B erm
C	er it might be
B	they got these lovely houses
A	mm
B	and the roofs are
A	council design
B	council
C	yeah they all come from
B	you can get up and walk around inside the inside the house itself and lots of people put another two rooms up in there
A	mm
B	because they're they're traditionally built you know none of this cross
C	it's on the way to
B	on the way to
A	you know on the way to Holt don't you? and when them council houses where that I don't know where the what village it is where there's a some bloke there who's always waving at the traffic
B	oh yeah yeah
A	you know the guy I mean?
C	oh yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	there's a big sign up there now
C	he's always outside waving to people
A	yeah
C	yeah

C	oh is there?
A	cos like everyone's going back to give him a peep on the
B	right
A	but he's still there he we came passed the other day and he was dressed you know toe to head with a hat on and everything and sort of like bright yellow fluorescent stuff like a massive great you know I don't know where he got the fluorescent hat from but he was out there you know and he was sort of like that pointing at the notice waving and pointing

B	oh right
A	he always at the bottom of

B	that's right yeah
B	oh dear

B	yeah
A	many
B	we used to have a beautiful old boy called

B	well we went over
C	yeah well we used to take stuff didn't we? to and then
B	we used to take stuff to
C	and then come back with stuff
B	and then one day we were oh we'll have that and picked this stuff up and this bloke went oi put that
C	oh I see when they they started being there didn't they?
B	yeah and we we weren't allowed to take anything else
A	mm no they made passed a law didn't they? you weren't allowed to take anything
B	when we first went to the tip we got our Christmas lights and
B	yeah we did we got Christmas lights
C	they were awful they were? they were little little flower things
B	they were flowers yeah
C	but they were but they worked
B	they worked yeah
C	we didn't have money
A	yeah I mean you see when you know apart from the stuff that people chuck away as normal
C	yeah
A	you know when people die I mean in the old days they didn't have nothing did they?
C	no they didn't no
A	what wasn't wore up and rubbish but now people die they've got a houseful of stuff
B	yeah
A	and all the relatives have a look round they don't want nothing cos they've got it already they don't want to clutter their place up and then it sort of either goes to house clearance or more often than not it just goes in the skip people just chuck everything away
B	they do don't they yeah
C	mm they do
A	and you can understand it as well really I mean
B	well I mean it when when we snuff it
C	yeah
B	my shed is full of stuff your room is full of stuff
C	the house is full of stuff
B	and the house is full of stuff
A	yeah
B	when you think we've got
C	no one's going to have space to
B	nearly forty years of accumulation here
C	take things are they?
A	well that's right
C	yeah
A	you know I mean in case someone someone has got a you know a a worn up something or other and they say well I'll just replace it with
B	yeah
A	like a sofa or something or a table and chairs you know but most of the stuff
C	you don't need an extra do you?
A	no you don't
C	no
A	I mean I mean at the moment
B	yeah yeah
A	and like has he put my front room is just full it's I mean it's got loads of
B	neither have I
A	well you know it's not doing any harm
B	no no you're right
A	you I sort of think well you know if I didn't need that room for anything
B	yeah
A	you know I've got all this stuff you know and what do I do with it and
C	yeah
A	you think well there's a box of stuff here I don't know what's in it can I be bothered to sort through it?
C	yeah
A	or can I just is it easier just just
C	cos you don't know what is
A	just lob it into a skip
B	that's right it's easier to lob into a skip
C	yeah cos you don't know him do you?
A	it is it is quite honestly and you and someone come along and think oh you could have that in a car boot sale you'd get you'd get a couple of quid for that or you get ten quid for that or you get five quid for that
B	yeah
A	and you think here you are get ten quid for it
B	yeah that's right
A	you you cart it around backwards and forwards
B	you cart it
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	in fact that's probably the best thing to do is get some car booter to sort of like to come up and just take it all away
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	you know cos
B	well we got some shelving out there steel shelving out that that we're that go into a garden centre place you know loads of stuff and we said to
C	yeah cos it needs hammering to make nice but it's okay
B	well er gonna stick it on Ebay oh don't stick on on Ebay don't well you know we had it there
C	I think I don't know yeah
B	that's seven years coming up now and he hasn't done anything about them so we said we'd flog them oh no he knows somebody who might want them
C	yeah
A	oh give us his number and
C	next next week it's going on Ebay
B	yeah it is it's
C	he he's had long enough to think about it
A	yeah why not yeah why not eh?
B	yeah
A	he don't do anything in the horticultural line though does he?
B	no
C	no it's really really strange cos someone
A	he had he's doing he's banners is he?
B	yeah he's still doing banners
C	for someone who who's
A	he's got a good market there
B	yeah yeah he's doing well
A	yeah I mean they say he's you know these sort of er a lot of er people have banners don't they?
B	yeah they do yeah
C	yeah
B	well though he said that's we that's drying up a bit now cos they want these big boards now
C	they want different ones with pictures on and which he can't do
B	with pictures and stuff like that cos they're cheaper than his big banners
C	he can do a certain amount of pictures but not
B	you have to string a banner up
A	mm
B	and when it
A	right health and safety
B	yeah and when you got heavy storms like they did have up the church their banner flew away then
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	he could get some of them little trailers you know like with boards on
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah he did a beautiful one for
B	god he has
A	oh really?
C	oh beautiful picture he got it photographed onto
B	yeah I helped him with it yeah he got it printed on on to this this er board boarding and er ah
C	absolutely gorgeous
B	yeah he worked on it very well cos he he is he's very artistic he makes a very good job of everything he does
A	has he got a
C	erm
A	I imagine he's got one for the plastic but has he got one for the paper?
B	I don't think so no
C	no no he's only got
A	cos
B	oh right yeah
C	oh yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	one off wallpapers
A	and if you've ever seen articles that but these people are charging like a hundred and sixty quid a roll
C	right
A	for specially designed wallpapers
B	yeah
A	a roll
B	a roll
A	and you know
B	yeah
A	but just getting er lining paper
B	that's it yeah
A	and then you roller paint it over to seal it
C	mm
A	and then you can stencil it this is what this is what she's doing at the moment up in the
B	oh right
A	is stencilling this stuff for an art project right?
B	yeah
A	but she said you know
C	mm
A	or even doing it with silkscreening you could just silkscreen it all the way up you know and
C	yeah yeah
A	you know you got your own wallpaper
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	but if you had one of them you know the one's I mean?
C	yeah
A	you can get these printers on roll which roll and you can just roll it through and it just prints it well probably you need some special ink
B	cos ink costs a fortune doesn't it?
C	special rooms to do it in too eh?
A	yeah yeah well this is it and the tables you need a long table
C	yeah
A	otherwise it all crumples up
B	yeah well there's a lot of that but to be honest with you all this erm making money type of stuff we wouldn't know about it any more
A	no no no no
B	that's that's like
A	but it seems it does seem that there's an seem to be an awful lot of people about with excess money
B	yes there is yeah
A	which they they're willing you know
B	yeah
A	and they have a magazine in there
B	they do they have a magazine yeah
A	and er they have these sort of fashion things like people wearing this stuff and there's sort of these people and they say oh T-shirt sixty-eight pounds from so and so so and so shoes hundred and twenty pound someone else and this isn't like out of way you know like coat three hundred and eighty quid
C	yeah mm
B	yeah
A	hand bag two hundred pounds
B	that's how the other half live though innit?
C	yeah
A	and these people just spend that sort of money
B	they do they do yeah yeah
A	I forget where I was the other day
C	yeah
B	I mean there's some places I mean if you if you go into Morrison's or any or any supermarket you get behind somebody who's got you know just like you and me but they're packed up to the top in stuff
A	I don't know what they do with all that
B	I don't know what they do with it
C	no
A	unless they got a shop in the village
B	well they could do but I mean
C	mm
A	oh but the surprising thing is sometimes you see these people go and they've got this massive great load of stuff and in the checkout and go that will be fifty-two pound what? how did you get all that for fifty-two quid someone else 'll go through and that'll be a hundred and twenty pounds for the same amount
B	yeah yeah I don't know how they do it
A	but we went to er
B	but they collect all these er vouchers and stuff don't they?
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and they stand there having to count count up the vouchers don't they?
A	all the discounts for playing the game
B	all the discounts yeah
A	we went to
B	oh yeah?
A	and there's these sort of posh friends that
B	yeah
A	we went to Wales and we walked down the sea wall down to the bottom
B	yeah that's a long way
A	well it's a good walk innit?
B	it is yeah
A	and then we had sort of tea and coffee in the in the little cafe down there
B	oh right yeah
A	and er
B	I don't know it
A	which is a really nice place and you get really it's really good quality
B	yeah
A	and we went to this place which is run by
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	and er sort of like they do cake and teas and things and a little bit of cake about that big two pound fifty a shot
B	what?
C	yeah
A	and er that was sort of the
C	oh yeah
A	your coffee we were sitting inside wasn't as though we were going outside
C	yeah
A	and a coffee in a paper thing
B	cup
C	oh they're horrible aren't they?
A	and you know these people who you know I mean we were there and there's nowhere else to go you know and it was so trashy
C	yeah
B	yeah it's horrible innit?
A	and there was four of us there and I paid and it come to seventeen quid for a cup of tea and a bit of cake
A	each
B	what?
C	oh right
A	I see some people
B	that's
C	yeah
A	well it's a one off you know
B	yeah but they got money out
C	they
A	but I mean I sort of like sharply in draw breath you know
B	yeah
A	but I mean the thing was that normally they take up out to the pub for fish and chips
B	oh right yeah
A	they insist on paying for it right
B	yeah
A	so I thought I'm getting away with you know seventeen quid is I've got off quite cheap
B	cheaply yeah
A	cos if we'd gone to the pub it would have been a lot more than that wouldn't it?
B	that would have been yeah
A	and er but you know for some people that's
B	well that's every day stuff isn't it?
C	it's only five pound each less than five pound each
A	yeah that's right I mean that's that's well I mean but it was only like a a sort of it wasn't lunch it wasn't
B	well I told you when we went to this what was it a Wimpy bar or something like that wasn't it? we we walked in to have this cup of tea and we were in this queue and we looked and what they did was fill up a a plastic mug with hot water and
C	yeah
B	and that was two
C	and a little stirrer you know to
B	and a stirrer and that was two pound something wasn't it? two pound fifty each
C	no I think it was only a
B	no it weren't it was two pound something
A	more than likely be a couple of quid I'll tell you what really annoys me is that
C	that's terrible
A	when you go somewhere and you get ask for a cup of tea and like the person in
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	what's all that about you're just paying for hot water then they've already got
C	how much is how much is a tea bag you know?
A	yeah
C	a penny isn't it? just over a penny I don't know
A	but we went to erm the Sainsbury's centre
B	oh yeah
A	you would think in the next three weeks if you want to get some art in mind you that costs you a tenner to get in each but they got a er erm an exhibition on at the moment and it's Francis Bacon
B	oh yeah
C	yeah
A	but it's all the influences on his life from the old masters and then they got the old masters there as well
B	oh great yeah
A	and they've got some fantastic paintings in there
B	yeah we don't like Francis Bacon do we?
A	well I'm not awfully fond of him
B	no
A	but er just going to see the old master's
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean they got
C	so what do you mean you get some art in?
A	what?
B	buy some
A	buy
B	buy some? can you do they sell
A	no what what did you say?
C	I thought you said you had to get some art in?
A	oh some mental art
B	yeah
C	okay
A	get into getting your brain
C	brain in
A	getting some art into your brain
C	yeah ideas
A	but you know I mean they got some really really good paintings in there
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I mean I'm not that keen on Francis Bacon I must admit
B	no
A	and also especially when you see his alongside
B	yes
A	something you know a real master
B	yeah
A	you know you sort of think it's more estheric esoteric
B	esoteric
A	whatever the word is rather than like anyway yeah but anyway
C	ah
A	we went in there and they got the little cafe bit in there and that was a better value than going on
B	yeah yeah weird innit? that is weird
C	yeah
B	I mean when when whenever you go to the coast anywhere you'd have to think there's only three months of the year they can make any money and if they got to open down the winter or earlier
A	yeah but it's not it's not the case at
B	no not really no no no
A	you know where you park down there?
B	yeah that's four quid innit?
A	can you remember what it's called down there?
B	oh no go on
C	er?
B	get my mind
A	Abraham's bosom
B	oh right
B	yes I did know that
A	cos this woman was there she said you know
B	oh
A	when she she always as kids they knew it as that
B	yeah
A	and she said no one's ever heard of it I said well I've heard of it
B	yeah
A	you know? but erm yeah I mean you used to be able to go and park down there it was like a couple of quid all days wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	and then cos that was when it was under control of
A	and then the
B	lease
A	the lease for
B	yeah
A	now it's like one eighty an hour
A	you know or two pound an hour you know for every hour
B	yeah
A	so if you're going to be down there for six hours on the beach
C	oh dear ah
A	and like of course they've taken the caf over as well and everything in here's like to make a profit
B	that's the Earl of
C	awful innit?
A	yeah we he's he he died didn't he?
C	yeah he died yeah
A	his son's now the Earl of
C	mm
A	once you could down there
B	yeah
A	and you could pay like one pound fifty
B	yeah
A	and now it's like two pound an hour
C	yeah see where we've just been in Cornwall you didn't have to pay anything for car park on the beach
B	no no we didn't did we? no
C	no
A	well yeah but I mean
C	yeah but they're lovely beaches
B	they're beautiful beaches you know
A	but I mean you see I used to really resent paying to go to the beach
B	yeah
A	but then you look and you think well someone's got to put all this hard standing in
B	they have
C	yeah
B	that's true yeah
A	and then you think how much would that cost a lorry load of stone
B	yeah
A	I mean you're talking a hundred quid a lorry load and it takes about fifty lorry loads and a dozer and a roller
B	yeah
A	to maintain it
B	yeah
A	and it shouldn't fall on the parish really so
B	no
A	you think well it's fair enough you you know a couple of quid here or a couple of quid there
B	but not not two pound a hour you said
A	that's right
B	ah
A	and you know you ever go to
B	yeah that's what I was then gonna say
A	when you drive down that long track to get the the back of the hills
B	yeah
A	at the back of the hills at
B	that's right yeah
A	they got parking meters down there now
B	have they?
A	a parking machine there
B	oh what?
A	I mean that always used to be free didn't it?
B	it was always free
C	yeah
A	but every time I go down there now or that way I usually park at erm behind
B	yeah
A	there's a a gap there
B	there's a gap there yeah
A	and you can sort of park there for nothing if you can get in
B	yeah if you can get in
A	but no so many people know that
B	no
C	mm
A	and it's just the same beach
B	yeah yeah
C	mm mm
B	everything is money money money money now
A	that's right and it's and it seems that you know like especially the council's and that
B	yeah
A	they they got like you know they're run by accountants aren't they?
B	they are yeah
A	they see they see a a council on the playing field and they say oh that playing field that's ooh you know that's worth you know
B	yeah
A	you know a hundred thousand quid that field therefore we've got to get at least a thousand pound a year
B	yeah
A	you know to to justify owning it
C	yeah
A	so then they start charging people who use it
C	that's it yeah
A	and you think well hang on
C	yeah
A	why don't I just leave it there and then
C	that's right
A	it doesn't actually cost em anything
B	I mean that's one thing about
A	yeah
C	just just checking the time
B	what's the time? yeah
C	he's got to go to the dentist
B	I gotta go dentist I've got an abscess
A	I got to go to the dentist next week
B	oh yeah ah
A	I had one tooth done I think I was having it done when I last saw you
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know so root canal but I got one one at the bottom which is it only hurts occasionally right?
B	yeah
A	and she sort of did an X-ray couldn't find anything wrong with it I'm saying well it still hurts you know even if you can't find anything wrong with it
B	yeah
A	so I'll probably have to have that removed
B	well I got I went to the dentist about two or three months ago wasn't it?
C	well we looked it up it's actually er two and a half months
B	October I think
A	October?
C	yeah it didn't seem that long ago
B	and that's that's an eye test you know K nine or whatever they call it
A	yeah
B	and er
A	what he took it out?
B	he went to take it out and that broke off about there and he said I can't get any more out unless I pull half your cheekbone away and now it's got an abyss in it
A	oh dear
C	mm
B	so that really I keep taking
A	so are you going to have to go to hospital for that?
B	I expect so but that's free innit?
A	mm
B	it's free in the hospital I expect they'll they'll give me some antibiotics to get rid of the abscess and then I'll have to go to hospital and that
A	cos when they did when they did my teeth you know they inject it and then it takes a while to wear off
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I was sort of walking round
B	yeah
A	and er
A	I said what? she said look in the mirror and this top lip had sort of dropped down like that
B	oh crikey
A	you know it'd really you know
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	I thought it didn't make any difference but he
B	yeah
A	and that lip was like that
A	just on one side
A	and I'd been walking in town like that going to the supermarket and chatting with the woman on the till you know
B	everyone says oh that poor bloke
A	yeah
B	he must have had a stroke
C	oh dear
B	oh dear they'd be feeling sorry for him
C	yeah
B	and talk
A	I looked a bloody state I tell you I didn't realise it
C	cos it always feels like there's something's wrong doesn't it
A	yeah but normally I mean it's like when you're drinking a cup of tea
C	yeah
A	you know you can't sort of you know
C	yeah you just can't feel it
A	it's sitting to one side and stuff
C	mm
B	yeah they tell you not to eat or drink for a couple of hours though don't they?
A	I don't know he didn't say that to me
B	did he?
A	oh afterwards yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	yeah make sure you don't go in hungry
C	yeah er
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but they got some good techniques these days
B	they have we got we got a funny one though
A	when I did this had this thing they did have a thing where they stick this sort of plastic sheet in your mouth
B	oh yeah
A	it's it's and it's
C	mm?
A	yeah but what it does is like when they you know when you're
A	or when they used to be sort of drilling and spraining it you're up there and it's all going down the back of your throat and
C	oh yeah
A	you're sort of gagging away
C	yeah you're going mm
A	yeah and now they sort of
C	oh right?
A	well it's it's sort of like a rubbery type membrane
C	so only when it happens to your top teeth then
A	yeah
A	sort of in your mouth you know clip it to your back teeth
C	right
A	and then you can ignore all the stuff that's going on cos you can't feel it
B	you don't have to go
C	suck it out
B	suck out a chunk
C	suck half your cheek off
A	what time you got to go?
B	er
C	be there at three
B	I got to be there at three yeah
C	yeah shave first don't you?
A	oh where you gotta go?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	I got to have
A	so you said this dentist was a funny dentist?
B	yes he's er he's different to what we used to have we used to have another one
C	mm
A	well you said they were really good
B	well they used to be very good
C	oh they're excellent
B	but this this one he's he's a bit of a
C	mm
B	he's a bit of a sort of a he
C	ah a foreign guy and he was so so good and
B	yeah
C	really sort of really impressed with him weren't we? and then we had another nice one who actually took photographs of your teeth and showed you the photographs and what was wrong with you he was good too
B	yeah yeah
C	and he disappeared then we had a a lady who we only had the once and we got a form to fill in they sent a form a letter saying how was your experience at the dentist?
B	yeah
C	and we reckon she got struck off
B	yeah
A	why cos she was no good or?
B	she weren't very good
C	well we we went for a check up and she did a quick fillings didn't she?
B	yeah she did put fillings in at the time
C	like five minutes but
B	which was which was not not supposed to be on because they were you have to pay for that don't you?
C	well she well she just wasn't there again so
B	no she just wasn't there
C	we're guessing that something was wrong with her
A	yeah it's obviously something up
C	yeah and then we got this one didn't we?
B	then we got this one and he's
C	okay
B	he's okay
C	he's okay he stink of garlic though and I don't like people who stink of garlic do you? and breathing all over you when you
A	yeah that's not very good is it?
B	no
A	I have this this erm well girl I would she was certainly a girl when she started there
B	yeah
A	and she's Spanish I think
B	yeah she good?
A	and er
B	where do you go?
B	oh right
A	but er
B	is that national health there?
A	well they aren't
C	yeah that's how it is isn't it?
A	and er I've been always you know I've been with this this this girl for several years now
C	yeah
A	trouble is she you know has got very good English you wouldn't you wouldn't think she was foreign at all
B	no
A	but she talks so quietly
B	yeah
A	she sort of like says well I'm going to have look
B	yeah
A	you're not quite sure whether she's talking to her assistant or to you
A	you know and I'm gonna go this and I'm gonna this and do this mm mm pardon? oh no it's alright
C	yeah
A	and then she sort of says er er er come back in two re re I don't know what we can do with but because I'm on pension credit you see
B	yeah
A	I get everything for nothing
B	yeah
A	I don't have to pay for anything
B	that's nice
A	and you know I can have all sorts done
B	yeah yeah
A	crowns and god knows what
B	you could get pregnant like a pregnant woman yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	yeah she's alright but then when I was in the waiting room the other day there was a woman came in who was obviously a pensioner but you know well fairly well to do she's oh can I have an appointment
B	oh god
C	ah
A	and that is expensive innit?
B	yeah
A	even you know any private treatments
B	yeah
C	I've no idea the difference it it's huge is it?
A	well national health is sort of like basically half of you know you probably pay if you go in there for a check up it's about twenty-five quid
C	oh
B	that is yeah
A	if you have anything like there's a a
C	yeah
A	extraction fillings
C	yeah
