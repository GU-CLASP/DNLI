A	so Sunday lunch in
B	yeah
A	I think it's very
B	it's quite a mashup of a building isn't it?
A	yeah it is a mashup of a building I do really like their flowers though I mean that's pretty impressive you need to know how to grow those sort of flowers and we're already what through summer?
B	yeah but it was like really warm
A	yeah it's unseasonably warm
B	well that's the kind of the Indian summer isn't it?
A	cheers my love
B	cheers to
A	to a day in
A	it's rather nice
B	what
A	ah this is one good thing about coming up here
B	mm
A	I can get my get my cider later on tonight
B	oh I see so you've got it all planned out haven't you? get to lay around in my cider cider bath
A	well considering how much we used to pay well I used to pay for a Norfolk Aspall cider well a Suffolk Aspall cider in
B	mm
A	that
B	well that was kind of
A	it was like eighteen dollars
B	pretty bonkers wasn't it?
A	yeah it was it was bonkers
B	and they just pitched themselves as a certain type of outfit didn't they?
A	English British
B	well it doesn't cost that much they're just making a good kind of triple profit on it
A	yeah
B	don't forget they've got to pay more tax in Australia for alcohol too
A	yeah well I don't miss that
B	coming up here today?
B	it was a lot quicker than I thought it would be
A	I was thinking more about the journey we've been on for the past nine months
B	nine months?
A	yeah
B	oh is that your number did you grab a number?
A	is that the beef and the lamb?
unknown_female	yeah
A	oh that's ours thanks
unknown_female	lamb?
A	lamb shank is it? yep brilliant thank you
B	and beef fantastic cheers mate
unknown_female	alright sauces for you
A	great thank you
B	brilliant
A	that was fast
B	erm
A	wow
B	a haggisy type thing
A	mm lamb shank I haven't had a lamb shank in years
unknown_female	there we go
A	great thank you
B	oh brilliant thank you yeah I kind of didn't erm expect to be
A	oh
B	well I've only been up here a couple of times before and I kind of figured it was because it was struggle to come up this way
A	mm mm mm I know what you mean
B	and oh look at this
A	mm mm
B	a sightseeing tour so I've felt that they've just kind of come down here so they can check us out while we have a feed
A	that's quite cute
B	mm
A	mm
B	it's a lot more a thing to go
A	mm I think so
B	well what meets the eye is pretty good anyway
A	mm mm and I think in a way it's quite it's quite cute because I think the students here by and large sort of make a bit more of of of contributing to the sort of the scene
B	mm
A	where as in
B	do you think so?
A	mm I think so I mean have you ever been along to a
B	no
A	no and that's a bit weird isn't it? considering how long we lived there
B	in the past
A	mm
B	what's weird about it is just that it's not the kind of stuff that you want to go and see or?
A	erm perhaps it's perhaps it is perhaps it's not but
B	well what's your picture of the erm of what happens at
A	I mean to be fair I don't I you know I don't know apart from the fact that you know the name is famous
B	mm it carries a lot of history of a lot of kind of famous actors and presenters
A	mm
B	right
A	and it finds people and finds talent it's good at nurturing talent
B	yeah
A	so all I'm saying is that maybe I should go along one day to actually have a look
B	mm mm
A	but I think what I'm saying is that
B	mm mm
A	so you know
B	that was random how did they do that?
A	mm
B	that's pretty cool
A	and I think there is some you know there's some good stuff like that you know erm festival ideas and some of those things are free and
B	mm
A	what do you think?
B	well it depends on whether there's anything worthwhile on
A	yeah
B	that that actually when I say worthwhile that
A	mm mm
B	what's erm
A	you
B	what what's new? what's
A	I mean in
B	well I'm simply looking at like that
A	yeah
B	for the erm
A	that that's a very specific clientele I'd say
B	yeah but I mean
A	it's quite music-focused
B	and but pretty much most of it was kind of dealing with go and have a look at the history of this history of thatand the history of this
A	I think that's how they get the funding
B	you know
A	mm mm
B	which is fine but
A	mm
B	it's kind of like you could be standing in a crowd of people talking about history of
A	yeah
B	and so what's the point in it?
A	yeah yeah I mean I've always found
B	well they have those kind of events like in summer like the
A	mm mm I mean
B	some of them are family-oriented some of them aren'tyou know
A	I mean more regular feeling rather than once a year I mean of course they have
A	well maybe it's a part of
A	and some cities have that
B	yeah maybe it's part of the culture that you know what people are doing is mooching around and shopping
A	yeah shopping mm
B	or that these kind of
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah I don't decry that I'm talking more about something all year round something that is more of a place of an opening it's not necessarily an event
B	yeah
A	I miss places like that where people congregate because they need to they want to feel something from each other not just shopping
B	mm so so give me an example of a place anywhere that you've been thatkind of pulls that together
A	well
B	so you're talking about
A	well you just said give me an example so I'm giving you one
B	mm
A	true yeah but they're also cultural hubs
B	yeah so they've shanked to some kind of cultural connection around those hubs
A	mm
A	mm
B	you've got erm some of that kind of I suppose bars you've got a square that's on the other side of of the quay
A	mm
B	but it's not actually in town but it's on harbour side right? so they've wrapped that around a feature
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm they do split the flow up quite a lotin the city
B	but also they split split the culture and the society
A	mm
B	so
A	not really I don't feel they are
B	no?
A	I mean I've shown people around
B	mm
A	mm
B	and and and and layout
A	mm mm
B	and location
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	different cultures living together in the same place
A	mm mm
B	looking for different things erm
A	see if you had to choose between say living in somewhere like
B	well it depends on what you're looking for alright erm
A	mm
A	no that's true
B	in that way erm you know you can look at things on the surface but they may well be different when you're experiencing them over a long time
A	mm
B	erm and that it is off the beaten track
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	so
A	I know what you're saying I I know
B	it's not hub-based so
A	yeah yeah I mean like if your business depended on flying frequently you would want to be nearer to a well accessible to an airport like
B	yeah because it gives you access to a lot of Europe pretty easily
A	mm
B	being in
A	mm mm
B	and on a good day if you want to get to
A	mm yeah that's true
B	so
A	mm mm
B	and you you don't you live outside of it and you're connected differently so the point is how does it fit together with the way you feel connected with the location the place the culture so on and so on
A	mm
B	erm if your needs are you've got to be able to go to an airport once a month they're not gonna want to have to go from here to
A	mm and conversely if you don't need to be somewhere going somewhere once once a month the payoff is something you might contemplate?
B	well maybe yeah
A	yeah I mean if you only knew you were flying two or three times a year from
B	I don't know how long it takes erm well you I suppose you just bomb it down the
A	on the train
A	yeah it's a coach
B	mm
A	I agree if you were a businessman and you had to fly nearly every week or every other week from
B	maybe
A	cos your needs wouldn't be the same and also some people you know do have to fly from
B	yeah uh-huh
A	erm
B	well
A	if I can help it
B	versus what other
A	well there's buses and coaches and your own transport
B	yeah so
A	yeah I agree but it's still if you haven't got the money in your pocket you're going to have to find another way of
B	and the journey takes probably two two and a half hours
A	yeah
B	versus forty-five minutes
A	yeah it does mean that you have to spend
B	so
A	more time travelling
B	so if you valued your time and you said your time was worth fifty quid an hour
A	I know I'm just saying if you didn't have money in your pocket I find a lot of people don't necessarily have money in their pocket to spend on
B	oh yeah? is that right?
A	yeah well if you were like yeah if you didn't have that much money you wouldn't be going on expensive train journeys
B	is there something wrong with that bit?
A	no I just couldn't fit it all in I'm full
B	can I can I have it
A	yeah course you can and also if you are erm not rushing about to get into
B	well I've always pinned that down to the fact that the bloody place is flat
A	mm
B	right?
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	because the bloody place is flat you know so
A	hello
B	yeah it was really nice thank you
unknown_female	good thanks beautiful day
A	it is it's great yeah
B	yeah it's nice and warm
unknown_female	it's a nice
A	yeah
unknown_female	thank you
B	yeah erm and that's what we were saying before we came over here from Australia that we were gonna look at places which carried the right environment a place that felt good to be in and I think for me that's where that connection is the connection is with the environment around you and then you look at the other things that relate to that yeah
A	mm mm
B	you imagine being in a place like
A	mm
B	what kind of different place it might be
A	mm yeah
B	you know? erm or that if you lived in
A	too right it is yeah
B	so that's kind of like living in
A	yeah
B	erm so when you go to places other places in Europe I mean
A	no that's exactly what I was saying twenty minutes ago
B	mm mm
A	yeah where the people are friendly
B	a place where people want to be
A	I think that makes a big difference to me
B	mm
A	I could probably forego the the whole mountains and thing erm if I felt that there was a a central hub of erm people who enjoy living in the city clearly are very proud of it want to make it something interesting and fun for people
B	mm mm
A	because most of the time if you're working or whatever you are interacting with people
B	yes
A	and I think yeah I think you can get out into the countryside erm unless you live out in rural countryside where you probably want to get away from people erm being in the being in the heart of something in a city must be exciting because there's just so much going on
B	mm mm
A	so for me it's kind of like well if we can't live somewhere straightaway that's gonna be mountains and the lakes and the you know the things that we said would be important for us erm where else can we have as a stop gap which is you know interesting different but not
B	of course it is temporary
A	so I need
B	yeah of course yeah that's always the way that I've been thinking
A	yeah the reality is though is that we have to turn it into an implementation plan
B	yes that's right
A	and we've kind of stalled on that side
