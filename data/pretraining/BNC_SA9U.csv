B	the marking criteria and everything
A	I've got the marking criteria
B	well you can have a quick look at mine that's alright it is just to remind yourself before you
A	yeah
B	what you are doing
A	yeah
B	so whereas you can get up go for a cup of tea take your mind off things and then sit down again and you could then go oh look at this this is quite good or oh what's this pile of rubbish?
A	yeah
B	but you need to
A	listen to all these birds
B	lovely isn't it
A	where are they?
B	that one up there just now made that noise what's that?
A	I don't know

B	we need to go to the bird sanctuary look they are all
A	yes it is the time of year actually
B	yeah they've all come back again because they disappeared all that time when they started all that building

A	they go
B	you did it oh my god
B	you did it
A	sorry have I embarrassed you?
B	no I don't care I don't get embarrassed anymore
B	I don't I don't get embarrassed because I walk along talking to myself most of the time anyway since since I was pregnant
A	yeah
B	I just started talking to my bump
B	to nobody
B	I think you probably
A	or do you need another person?
B	have quite a good good argument
B	but on tape
A	I was thinking that if someone was good at accents they could just er do the same thing couldn't they? they could er just talk to themselves all day
B	I think that would be quite
B	be quite a chore
A	yeah
B	that would be very difficult
A	yeah probably not worth it
B	and you would end up completely mental
B	not like a little bit of talking to yourself that's going to be a lot of talking to yourself and making sure you get an answer from yourself
A	yeah
B	not just letting yourself drift away
A	not a very well-known one
B	reading is not the same though is it?
A	no well I think my idea of getting a load of kids round
B	did I?
A	did I? did I tell what
