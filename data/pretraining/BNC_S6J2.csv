A	you don't want to be reminded of the
B	yeah
A	we
B	mm
A	there's no point making hasty decisions about stuff like that
B	yeah
A	pictures of what?
B	just pictures I've painted or drawn
A	oh nice
B	uni stuff
A	mm
B	keep sakes
A	Cos she's a cow
B	she's a cow
A	right
B	zumba
A	zumba bumba
B	yeah
A	but necessary
B	yeah necessary
A	A necessary trauma
B	I feel a little bit like I can't breathe
A	oh god
B	he said I never thought that I'd be the person to let you down like that
A	oh god
B	yeah
A	okay
B	I feel like he understands and I said to him about even about the
A	mm
B	and I said but you never said anything back
A	yeah
B	I never behave like that with anybody else I've ever known
A	mm
B	well except for you because you're the only person that I felt so concerned that if something went wrong I wasn't picking just me up
A	yeah
B	and now I don't need to pick you up
A	yeah
B	and I said you
A	no
B	yeah
A	so how did you leave things then?
B	erm
A	mm
B	and he said you know I hope you do keep me posted with navy things as you go through the the process
A	yeah
B	I suppose I'll just text him like I'd text his mum
A	well it's up to you isn't it
B	no I'm not
A	I've put you off the plate back in here
B	the warming
A	yeah
B	if I don't I won't text him
A	I'm sure he will definitely text you on your birthday
B	mm
A	I think this is the bit where you walk away
B	yeah
A	you've said your piece
B	I've said my bit and feel better about it and
A	anything else that's getting said now is just going to be raking up the same issue
B	yeah
A	it's going to hurt again and again and again
B	quickly yeah
B	he said er do you know you're the most amazing person I know
A	mm
B	and I'm thinking in my head that's just what adults do
A	mm
B	erm and  he said I read  he said I read a an article today er it was a design thing
A	right
B	you know that you're not
A	A bit fucking melodramatic isn't it
B	mm
A	erm well I mean it that whole self
B	yeah
A	it's just that
B	yeah
A	I mean how many times have you had this conversation? You know I mean I appreciate today it's probably a bit more sever than he's used to
B	yeah
A	but London was pretty bad
B	yeah that was pretty bad
A	and the time before that when he you know you were saying
B	it's like he can't gauge severity
A	it's like I mean he he gets upset every time you have this conversation
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I I once screamed at him so bad
A	mm
B	and that's I think that's a bit of an autistic thing
A	yeah
B	like the way he walked in here today as if he knew it was wrong but he didn't know how wrong
A	he didn't know what was wrong
B	yeah
A	even though when you left things in London you said
B	yeah
A	and he just hasn't done that
B	no
A	Cos obviously he wasn't here last week
B	I'm a bit scared about the flipping
A	I'm feeling very confident for you
B	what about if the olive goes everywhere though?
A	I'd do it over the hob and then at least it can be saved as opposed to over the floor
A	wooh
B	oh
A	Cook cook cook
B	I'm just feeling like I'm draining my resources are just gone
A	well as hard as it is at least you know you've made the right decision
B	yeah
A	probably not in the short term
B	uh uh
A	I know maybe it's you know it's asking quite a lot from him
B	mm
A	that looked to be fairly easy going but has quickly become quite serious
B	yeah
A	do you reckon that's probably another sign of him not being able to gauge what's acceptable because you wouldn't book a holiday with somebody you've only seen three times
B	yeah
B	mental issues of the brain yo
A	is that cooked?
B	Don't know
A	aren't they supposed to be more brown than that?
B	I think so yeah
A	does it need to be flipped again?
B	do you think?
A	it's an
B	oh I'm a bit scared of the flipping
A	wooh
B	that's cooked on that side now isn't it?
A	yeah
A	hmm
B	argh
A	and I drove over there
B	argh
A	my sister made me  a cheesie  a cheesie toastie
B	seems to be a bit of full on Wednesday
A	yeah it's all a bit serious
B	yep
A	no wonder
B	is your sister still set on er a foreign life?
A	yeah
B	well it's
A	yo
B	you don't get to hear from six till six months before you're due to start?
A	you can't apply until six months before
B	really?
A	pass
B	that's a bit extreme isn't it
B	only a little bit of black on the bottom
A	I'm fine
B	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	seventy
B	yes feathers
A	yeah
B	Peacock feathers
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm feeling quite confident about that
B	yeah
A	oh you have met her from
B	yeah
A	I think the birthday turned out to be some sort of double date so I'm quite glad that I didn't go
B	oh
A	Cos basically
B	yeah
A	Cos I think that strange little DJ was supposed to go but I don't think he did
B	mm
A	and that's what I'm worried about
B	yeah
A	because it's Saint Patrick's day so I mean meet for a few bevies in the afternoon
B	this looks a good one
A	that looks a perfect one
B	mm
A	what are you going to have in yours? Cheesy?
B	er
A	red and yellow and pink and green and orange and purple and all the colours
B	all the colours in the world ever
A	mm
B	er mm mm mm
A	er I wonder if maybe we should open the window and close the door
B	are we making smoke?
A	I I couldn't see it before but I can see it now and that fire alarm is intense
B	yeah I don't really want to witness that if I'm honest
A	no
B	yeah
A	erm  and then  and then your above Primark
B	yep
A	and the vintage shop
B	do you know the best place to go to for stuff like that would be Camden Market wouldn't it
A	right
B	yeah
A	they've got loads of just random shit
B	yeah
A	did you?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm and also did a really amazingly tailored blazer
A	mm
B	it didn't have a price on it
A	ah
B	yeah and it but the rest of the stuff in there was quite kind of around the forty pound mark so I don't think it would have been ridiculous
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	you weren't tempted?
B	very tempted but potless
A	oh yeah
B	yeah and also it would have suited your figure but I think once you put
A	mm
B	yes
A	oh good
B	ah ah ah get over
A	that's fine
B	that's fine
A	that's how it's supposed to go man
B	I'm trying to think of a place you could go for for stuff like that
A	H and M
B	yeah
A	and I would like a nice one
B	yeah
A	or I could go in the lovely lingerie place in town and see if they've got a sale on
B	the one near the
A	in
B	I think it will be a really fun night though
A	it should be really good
B	yeah
A	I don't know who's going to be there and
B	yeah you go and you think why was I? Yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah and I suppose and I'm so out of the habit of doing that now
B	yeah
A	it is nice
B	yeah
A	and considering like before you would go out twice a week at least you know it seems seems out of the ordinary now to go out into town
B	yeah
B	soft drinks are a pound
A	that sounds pretty awesome
B	yeah
A	typical
B	well
A	I suppose that means
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	so stressful because she's having the ceremony there as well
A	oh right whereas last time it was just the reception
B	yeah last time it was just breakfast reception and most of that service is done by
A	oh god
B	oh fuck me
A	you've got to not worry about these things though
B	yeah
B	mm
A	my friend at work
B	do you want cheese in here?
A	I think she's a bit worried
B	or do you want Nutella or do you just want it on a plate or?
A	er
B	what do you feel the need for?
A	I might just have a spoon full of Nutella
B	do you want it in it while it's in the pan or?
A	no that's fine thank you
B	there's also another one in here if you can fit it in
A	I'll see how I go
B	fit it in your mouth hole
A	I think it's the grill that smells cos I think the smoke comes off the grill
B	I think it might be this
A	oh
B	she's shit
A	mm
B	to clean
A	yeah no don't be silly
B	no I don't
B	yeah
A	I don't think she does anything to be fair
B	I don't even know why
A	I think they're probably mates
B	probably best buds
A	mm
B	yeah I'm just going to have sugar thanks
A	oh
B	I'm going to steal some er out of
A	did I tell you it's my two year anniversary at work?
B	no
A	this week
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I'd I'd completely forgotten
B	worrying a good thing there though
A	I think it just means that we're settled
B	mm
A	it's to feel like
B	you're gaining from what you're doing
A	yeah I mean
B	A few little hiccups
A	yeah
B	yeah it is actually
A	yeah
B	all of them
A	mm
A	cold banana to the tooth
B	oh
A	wowsers
B	microwave it
A	microwave it
B	I do have brains
A	huh?
B	I do have brains
A	huh
B	hide the bad boys
A	mine mine mine
B	oh
A	well maybe it's just your body
B	oh my god
A	that's why because they'll drain it all out and then all the sugar comes out
B	yeah
A	what?
B	because the other thing that's hurt is my spine which if you rearrange the words spells out penis
A	oh
B	double penis
A	oh it's a double penis
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	do you need Golden Syrup on as well
A	no
B	contraband
A	I need to find a bit of something
B	oh no
A	it's tasty
B	mm
A	yep
B	or over the past two days
A	yep
B	two packets of Mini Eggs
A	mm mm
B	this whole yumminess
A	mm
B	A chocolate mini chocolate muffin
A	yum
B	but that's like that's a bit of an astounding intake isn't it
A	but that's but it's probably not even your full calorie intake because you're not eating any food
B	mm
A	like yesterday was the first dinner you've actually eaten
B	yeah
A	so you're probably not even taking in your two thousand calories
B	I've never even counted calories
A	mm
B	I find I'm really jealous that I can't though
A	mm
B	erm I couldn't actually sleep till about two O'clock this morning though
A	really?
B	mm
A	mm
B	like my dinner was just sat like in my chest for hour and hours
A	oh mate
B	mm
A	well I hope didn't poison you with anything
B	no cos it's everything I eat
A	oh my god
B	like at work today I had a piece of garlic bread that was like this big
A	oh god
B	and about as much pasta as would fit in a ladle
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	I had I just didn't feel hungry
A	mm
B	I still didn't feel hungry before I made pancakes
A	oh no
B	Cos it's like my body's a bit scared to digest stuff now
A	yeah
B	it does take awhile to get it over
A	yeah it does
A	urgh
B	and everyone's like shut up
A	urgh
B	but he must have seen it in my face and being able to relate to it
A	the fear
B	Cos he he had it really bad as well
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	half six till half seven
A	mm
B	but I don't finish work till six so I'm going to pack my bag
A	join suit
B	oh I'm going to need another one
A	oh no I'm fine
B	are you sure?
A	I'm done
B	yep
A	so you're going to pack a bag
B	yep
A	you're going to come back and pick me up and we're going to go
B	yep
A	okay
B	so I'll just drive
A	is it? I'm not it's not going to be out of your way to pick me up?
B	no no no
A	Cos otherwise I could just meet you there
B	no it goes
A	okay
B	yeah well probably be twenty past cos stupid East Road traffic
A	traffic
B	isn't it
A	I get really fucked off if people creeping in from the left
B	ah
A	really
B	from the  road?
A	and this woman was trying to come into my road into the road
B	which one do you want? Oh god
A	are they  are they  different?
B	this one's thinner but blacker
B	do you think? I don't know
A	yeah don't have the cancer one
B	yeah
A	everyone's really fucked off that you're having to queue
B	yeah
A	and she beeped at me
B	did she?
A	yeah so I obviously flipped her the finger and I was just like fuck off and she was going like that in the mirror
B	yeah
A	no
B	yeah I know I hate that as well
A	mm
B	to drive thirty-five minutes this morning
A	God thirty-five minutes
B	I didn't have to be at work till ten so it should have been after rush hour traffic
A	mm mm
B	oh I just no
A	it drives you mad
B	just no
A	mm
B	it was a
A	mm
B	yeah I drove via the surgery and just explained and said oh if you come back at twelve you can sit and wait
A	okay
B	but if you come just before twelve you'll be the first one to check in so you won't have to wait
A	I'll be here for that then
B	I'll be here for that
A	oh of course cos that's when they said that you'd have to go to hospital
B	mm
A	oh yeah it fucks me off
B	and at the very end you get to the point where you have to give one give one give one give
A	mm
B	he wasn't going to give one
A	mm
B	he got this little Punto and erm teenage guy
A	so you're in the left or the right?
B	I'm in the left
A	mm
B	so I'd let like the car in front of me had gone and the one before had let him in
A	mm
B	so I'd let the big Merc in
A	mm
B	and then Punto put his foot down
A	mm
B	and he just looked at me and I went tada
B	and this teenage boy was like
A	I would have been so fucked off
B	yeah
A	fine
B	from the traffic lights?
A	from the traffic light
B	yep yep
A	yeah
B	there's nobody every goes down there apart from there apart from buses so there's no reason that shouldn't be a bus lane
A	mm
B	mm
A	and he pulled out and it obviously the traffic was coming from that direction because we'd stopped and for that traffic that stopped so he knew we were about to move
B	that's so bad
A	I'm like what the fuck do you think you're doing?
B	yeah
A	and then he started nestling in
B	mm
A	oh man if that had been me I would have gone absolutely ape shit
B	yeah
A	absolutely mental
B	I'm laughing because that's something I would do
A	that is something you would do
B	yeah
A	but then I think why don't I just do it the wrong way and then I'd be there quicker
B	mm
A	my speed in city's a bit of an issue as well because I really put me foot down
B	mm
A	because obviously by now I know where the speed cameras are
B	yeah
A	but you just don't know
B	really?
A	Cos you know it's twenty now? Yeah they've changed it
A	yeah
B	no
A	right
B	mm
B	wow
A	well they were doing thirty
B	yeah
A	you're not really going to look
B	and the worst thing is
A	mm
B	you're not looking at this road signs
A	so and because the roads are so narrow people just walk out on the off the pavement
B	on the ward
A	and that's that
A	Cos isn't it you know it's horrible when you're cycling and the cars beep at you
B	I nearly died
A	my heart's in my mouth
B	I think I'm done
A	yeah
B	I don't think I can fit it in
A	tough
B	I like just leave it
A	yeah
B	half six to half seven yeah
A	so we could be home by eight
B	yes
A	okay
B	well we can make sure
A	mm
B	I can just quick
A	quick
B	be quick showerers
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah you sound a bit booked up
A	well I'm supposed to be seeing
B	gym and gym? Er gym and beer?
A	gym and beer
B	I like gym and beer
A	the two go hand in hand
B	one thing the doctor did say was yes swim
A	oh good okay so at least you know
B	yep
B	no
A	it's always going to just going to grow of it's own accord
B	should have gone but keep it moving so
A	oh man
B	this time next week
A	oh right so it's not a week after the accident
B	the doctor's?
A	if the willy hasn't gone down
B	I have a week from now for willy
A	A week from now
B	erm cos he measured measured willy today
A	he actually measured it?
B	yeah and like I was like okay so you're going to want to see this? He was like yeah
A	oh
B	erm he said okay before you do do you want me to get a nurse in here so it's not just the two of us? Cos I mean he's a guy and I was like oh no I don't care
A	mm
B	erm
A	the doctor?
B	yeah
A	yeah as you do yeah
B	erm
A	absolutely
B	erm and so he measures the willy
A	mm
B	and then afterwards I'm talking away to him while I'm putting my  putting my  tights up and pulling them up
A	was he?
B	yeah you could tell he was like looking at me and then he was just like
A	oh my god
B	I think it was more an embarrassment of don't look don't look
A	I know I know
B	it was so funny
A	although people just do it all the time
B	yeah
A	do you?
B	yep
A	yeah
B	I think that just must look so bad
A	well I suppose better than staring at their boobs like I do
B	yeah
A	although
B	yeah
A	and you've got a bit confused
B	I've never look at women's crotches
A	you just wouldn't would you
B	yeah
A	yeah always bum
B	favourite favourite
A	yeah
B	I have a  I have a  thing about backs
A	yeah
B	not just the whole shoulder neck area
A	mm
B	and erm there's a clip in Just Friends film at the end when he takes his top off and
B	and people were coming around and saying what's that? It's just the screen saver
A	that's a bit peculiar
B	yeah but we might have accidentally done that for the day
A	who's paying the electricity bill?
B	what?
A	bet you were their favourite tenants actually
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and just opened all the compartments of it
A	yeah that's not normal
B	yeah
A	that's not what normal people do
B	yeah
A	what was she making? That smells wrong
B	I've no idea
A	yeah
A	no I've never heard of that one
B	yep
A	pancakes pancakes
B	although I was thinking today after the whole doctor copping looks at you
A	mm
B	I mean I I was got a I had got my arse out really so
A	mm
B	poor poor bloke couldn't really do anything else but look
A	mm mm
B	erm I kind of got quite excited which makes me sound awful about how I'm going to maybe in about two months
A	mm
B	we're hoping for less than that because birthday's in less than that
A	mm
B	have more of a hot bod
A	having a hot bod
B	because I've never done it before
A	having a hot
B	Cos when I was smaller than this
A	mm
B	the last time I was ever smaller than this was when I was twenty-one
A	mm
B	but my fit my shape was different
A	oh
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	I did have a
A	but I mean you have got quite a level of confidence already haven't you
B	the sexy top and skirt is a very new thing
A	it's very very very lovely
B	but I didn't even wear stuff like that when I was eighteen
A	really? Well I think the confidence does come with age though doesn't it?
B	no
A	it gets to a point where I think
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well I do but not compared to say twenty
A	yeah
B	I said but twenty-five sounds like a a serious age yeah
A	serious birthday
B	she says yeah it's a bit of a right of passage isn't it
A	having yeah babies
B	babies yep
B	yep all that cack
A	have a career
B	erm and I said oh I think you know things are just different now
A	mm
B	erm but I realised I still compare myself
B	no that's okay
B	you know when you go
A	mm
B	I still compare myself to girls who are eighteen
A	right
B	well I know but I do and I only realised it this week
A	mm
B	like my thought of you know being naked with the guy
A	mm
B	my ideal in what he's expecting
B	mm
B	is an eighteen year old body
A	mm
B	when really
A	well you
B	well yeah that's true
A	there are no womanly bits to it
B	move my head
A	oh mate
B	it's a bit weird innit?
A	I mean you just
B	yeah
A	well there you go you see
B	yeah
A	healthy and that you can be satisfied with
A	no  aren't you?
B	that's seven years ago
B	Seven years ago
A	you're a maniac
B	in  head it's only about three minutes ago
A	well no
B	yep
A	and I'm not
B	sounds fair
A	ah
B	what do you need?
A	A new brain
B	brain please
A	Pinky
B	oh that guy that wanted to go to Colchester was texting me again today
A	oh yeah
B	and I've just
A	is this
B	this is a different one
A	I like
A	yeah
B	yeah this is the guy that wanted me to go up this weekend to a concert and I was like not going to be doing that  you're a  you're a killer
A	mm
B	Don't even know you
A	hmm mm
B	what's the point of that message? I don't know
B	erm so  he starts  he starts talking a little bit flirty
A	mm
B	erm been to the doctor
A	oh
B	and he wrote back something like can I see? And I was like what? My my ugly leg or my knickers? And he was like well it would definitely be the knickers
B	erm but then
A	mm
B	and you know when you just think there's something not quite quite right about you
A	you weren't comfortable?
B	no
A	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
B	erm anyway so he sent me a message saying something about a pig and I was like er anyway there's loads of me on the stupid site so why don't you send me one of you cos there's only  one of  one of you on there?
A	no
B	and he said okay then
A	really he looks that different to the photo?
B	really different
A	huh
B	like either this guy's cos the guy that was on the photograph on the Plenty Of Fish thing

A	mm
B	the picture he sent me
B	yeah
A	oh right yeah yeah
B	see his collar bones
A	mm no I don't like that
B	mm he's definitely gone wrong and I swear I was like holy crap
A	maybe he's got a disease
B	do you think? Maybe he's just a liar
A	maybe it's just a different person
B	yep
A	so he's he's gone wrong then
B	so he's gone wrong
A	scratch
B	scratch
A	fine
