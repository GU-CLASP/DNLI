A	testing
B	testing testing
A	one pass one batch two batch penny and a dime
A	yes
B	it's the quote the play is the thing
A	yes
B	is from what play?
A	that is a very good question so we're assuming it's a play in which there's a metadrama?
B	I think it's from Shakespeare
A	well yes I mean I
B	well it's obviously from Shakespeare
A	it's it's from Shakespeare but
B	but erm
A	so
B	I mean it's famously from Shakespeare isn't it really?
A	yes so it's one of his better-known plays? or is it just a well-known quote from a lesser play?
B	okay so in what in what plays are there
A	metadrama
B	drama?
A	so we've got
B	so Hamlet?
A	Midsummer Night's Dream Hamlet well there's definitely more why have I why is my brain frozen erm erm
B	there's one in erm in er The Tempest?
A	there is yes
B	I think it could be The Tempest
A	it's possible I've only read it once so
B	yeah I've only read it once good catching by the way mate
A	cheers good throwing
B	well oh sorry that was sarcastic
B	either way can't win
A	er I I it's it's something I've learned in life is I never win
A	I'd have a very very boring sitcom sitcom written about me
B	saying I never win?
A	yeah
B	but you can win
A	how?
B	anyone can win
A	how do you win?
B	how do you win? you okay this I how you win you learn
A	yeah
B	and you practice it until it's a motor erm until it's like a motor programme
A	yeah
B	and your muscles remember it
A	yeah
B	or your your speech remembers it or whatever skill it is
A	yeah
B	and then you erm practice it in different places so that you er you get a you have passion for it and you apply the skill that you've learnt motor with passion and interest and perseverance and that's how
A	yeah
B	you win
A	well I've put my passion and endurance into video games
B	yeah uhu
A	don't always win at those frequently don't nice catching
A	do I though?
B	yeah you do look how quickly you complete them it's cos you've got the motor skills and you've got the perseverance
A	yeah but is that winning? if I complete something if I
B	oh so how are you defining winning?
A	exactly
B	doing well at something
A	yeah that
B	better than other people is winning for you
A	to quote our robots that I'm certain is the right question
B	oh not just
A	how does one win?
B	love mercy act justly and walk humbly
A	is that One Life?
B	sorry?
A	is that One Life?
B	that's in the Bible mate
A	I was half expecting that to be a
A	yeah that's a recipe for winning
B	well you you get you learn the skill practice it so that it's a motor programme
B	and then apply character
A	okay
A	so I would argue that winning at life for me because obviously it's different from anyone else is to be happy how
B	yeah
A	do I learn happiness as a motor skill?
B	oh well what is
A	that scuppered you didn't it?
B	what is what is happiness to you though?
A	I would
B	what what is happiness? it's so intangible that it's irrelevant is that
A	yeah
B	what you're saying?
A	yep
A	I'd say that how I achieve happiness isn't the relevant sign of this
B	oh okay
A	not how I become happy I mean the form of happiness happiness is a state of being how do I learn the ability to become happy as a motor skill?
B	I think er you as a motor skill
A	yeah
B	I think you need to er glean and
B	glean and understand from lots of people just as okay so if you are saying how do I do forehand in tennis
A	yeah
B	erm
A	hit the ball
B	you
A	with the forehand
B	you learn lots from different people by watching people by erm watching people by reading books by getting people to coach you so those two so like watching people learning from people and then getting people to to coach you and then you understand what the skill is so for happiness watching people who are happy erm learning from people who are happy and getting someone to help you
A	okay
B	and then but you you see it looks different for other people so obviously
A	yeah
B	the set technique of the forehand is it's the same for everyone but it looks different for different people
A	how?
B	so you find how?
A	yes
B	well a Roger forehand's forehand Roger forehand
B	Roger Federer's
A	watching him him Roger Roger forehand
B	there's a girl in my er in my literature class
B	there's a girl in my er English class whose surname is
A	to be a literature student
B	erm so maybe learning from people get them get and then understand for yourself what the skill is understand what happiness is for yourself f
A	yeah
B	and then practice it in everyday life so maybe the skill that you've learnt from other people that happiness is to live in the moment
A	uhu
B	okay so just enjoy what we're doing right now
A	yeah
B	enjoying the simple things of life maybe you could pick that up from someone so then what you need to do is then practice that
A	yeah
B	every day erm once you've practiced it it becomes a motor neuron so that by
A	it becomes a motor neuron does it?
B	a motor programme so by the time you're ten years down the line you've been practicing this every day then it's becomes a way of life and all you need do is apply your perseverance to understand it's part of your character and you're suddenly happiness in that sense is part of you're starting to win in your in your sense
A	yeah
B	simple
A	I mean yeah
B	this is all tennis theory in er
A	this this is tennis under the guise of er
B	philosophy
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	forearm? forehand
B	forehand yeah
A	nice
A	that was nice
B	well you just have to
A	if you if you hold the back the bat? the
B	the head yeah
A	yeah the head
B	yeah
A	you have you hold that the other way round so that the handle is still in your hand
A	but the head is covering your forearm
B	okay yeah
A	and you hold your arm outstretched and you hit it so you're hitting the ball between the erm
B	so the wrist
A	the elbow and the wrist
B	for some sort of weird drop shot would it be?
A	I mean it it's literally so you could call the move the forearm as opposed to the forehand but yeah sure it's a drop shot whatever
A	play some tennis oh man you know what I
B	five iron?
A	not five iron they're wedges and it would probably be like an eight
B	seven iron
A	eight or
B	or an eight iron yeah
A	eight iron probably
B	so
A	oh yeah this this one just er I'll hit it really hard but I'll get a little you know not too much distance and I'm just there like guys you need two clubs in golf the driver and the putter
A	although to be fair I did use I think I used the putter in the rough one time I was like the rough was just outside the green it was
B	oh that's alright you're allowed to do that yeah
A	I was probably about like ten fifteen yards off the green and I was in some pretty thick rough I was like you know what? putter I'll smash it and I'll just flick into the green nicely
B	did it?
A	no
B	but it got caught in the rough
A	even slightly
B	yeah
A	I er I I thrashed at the grass a little bit made quite a few divots the putter was probably irreparably broken although my friend
A	just a long piece of stick essentially
B	did you ever did I ever tell you the story of
A	I don't think you did
A	yeah
B	see who can hit it the furthest and he swings it
A	yeah
B	let's go of the club at the right point
A	yeah
B	and it's just gone straight up in the air
B	and erm and he looks round and looking like he's killed a man
B	he was just really kind of quiet atmosphere and erm
B	that come we just see
B	over the net
A	what?
B	yeah and he was using
A	no way
B	and
B	just bang
B	we did but thankfully no one was on the first tee
A	thank goodness
B	cos it would have just it it
A	to be fair I'm gonna be honest like golf is just a statistical nightmare when it comes to injury and death like it's not likely but the amount of times that I've heard stories like that or that I've done stuff like that where I've been on the driving range and I've hit a ball and it's had so much shwang it's gone over the net straight into like the second hole kind of area and I'm like you have
B	over that way?
A	you have yeah over to the right you have so
B	but I tell you I was out
A	and like it it's not gonna hit anyone at all like on a regular basis but like when when the statistics do
B	yeah yeah
A	if you get hit by a club that comes
B	yeah
A	flying over the netting you get hit by a loose ball from the driving range
A	you you are not getting up
A	soon after that
A	yeah
B	and er he's we were on the green and we hear fore
A	yeah
B	like this we're like oh so we're kind of ducked down like that bracing ourselves
A	yeah
B	and and the ball smacks into the golf bag
A	oh my goodness
B	it's
B	into the golf bag woah
A	yeah I nearly got hit at
B	yeah
A	with the driver so it's going pretty fast and we just hit a fore and we turn around and the problem with shouting fore in my opinion is unless you're an actual golfer you know to brace or crouch down as you did it's just letting you know a second before when you get hit that you're going to get hit like if you don't get hit it's like a oh hang on a sec he said fore but if you do get hit all the
B	why don't you just
A	and like so
A	and we both hear the ball
B	that's the worst thing to do
A	just whip right past our ear cos we're probably like a couple of metres apart and
B	I guess but statistically like the worst thing to do is to run around right? or no
A	no like
B	it makes I guess the worst thing to do would be to make yourself big
A	yeah I mean like it does sound logical at first that the most statistically bad thing to do is to move about because that way you're erm you know increasing your area over the time between the ball being shouted as fore and the ball hitting something but in realistic terms the ball is only going to one place so
B	yeah
A	if you run about you're not unless the ball was also moving in the fourth dimension
A	erm but yeah making yourself large is the worst thing to do facing the direction that the person so when they shout fore turning around is a bad idea getting hit in the back of the head's not good getting hit like in you know the forehead or the face
A	is not not great
B	oh thank goodness for that
A	yeah thank goodness
B	nice
A	tight throwing
B	okay
A	mind if we take a break from this
A	cheers buddy okay
B	I'm gonna be at this end now
A	yeah that's good
B	another ten minutes is that alright?
A	yeah
B	so ten minutes left?
A	is that alright?
B	yeah that's absolutely fine yeah tell you what I was thinking about there when you were throwing stones at me I was thinking
B	David and Goliath?
A	no although I'm definitely David
B	while I'm throwing stones
A	yes ta I have the physique of David
A	I also have the potential for adultery and murder in my life later
B	everyone does though everyone
B	yes
A	oh of course you er
B	well I've played with
A	at
B	if BB guns mean guns that fire those little pellets yes
A	BB pellets yes
B	yes
A	yes that that that's very astute of you
B	well I didn't know if enough can that meant like some sort of weird innuendo
A	like what?
B	I dunno what but you know when someone says
A	a phallic reference per chance?
B	go on have you?
A	yes I have and I was thinking if those stones had hit me that would have been a similar pain to er that of being hit by a BB gun pellet cos those things can be vicious
B	I'm not sure that stone would have hurt very much though
A	no it would have stung if it had hit though
B	really?
A	like BB pellets do yeah
B	oh if you threw it hard yeah
A	yeah
B	but not as I was throwing it in there
A	well the er the flight path of it meant that when it was coming down it gained a little bit of pace they were also quite sharp
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh sorry mate I didn't realise it was gonna
A	oh it did don't worry like
B	like
A	it's called banter
B	I went like that
A	yeah but it was
B	okay yeah
A	yeah yeah I was thinking of er yeah BB guns they hurt
B	no no witty anecdotes
A	great great great well
B	to answer this question we found
B	and interviewed him
B	ah right this afternoon
A	yeah
A	also his birthday by the way don't forget
A	yeah
B	is it really?
A	yes
B	and we're going to
A	yeah
B	are you sure it's his birthday?
A	absolutely
B	are you absolutely not having me on?
A	I'm absolutely not having you on the look on his face will
B	okay cool cool
A	yeah
B	yeah great I will erm in which case wish him happy birthday instead of inviting him
A	yeah
B	to play tennis I had no idea it was his birthday today
A	yeah I mean you can still play tennis with him
B	I think we can buy him his his
A	drink?
B	dessert yeah
A	his
B	should buy him a big dessert for his birthday
A	even better even better like to there and kick up a big fuss about the fact that it's his birthday and see if we can get it for free
B	yeah
A	why don't we go on a tour of all of the restaurants in
B	which er which business would you own if you owned all of
A	oh that is a really good question erm what I'd like to do really is consult the
B	oh yeah
A	kind of the definitive thing
B	Swalec would be quite good I think
A	Swalec?
B	I feel like there's lots of potential in that university town
A	yeah
A	oh
B	all the gas to everything erm well so it's it's an energy company
A	oh right oh of course it is sorry for a minute there I thought that was like the name of that group within the university that we went to the lecture on Hamlet for and I was like great have fun with those guys
B	erm
A	nerd
B	nerds erm
A	prepared to be bored
B	yeah I think cos Swalec would be like the er the erm utilities kind of thing
A	yeah nice
B	a monopoly and also they're they sponsor the big stage and like it's good they're doing well
A	yeah that's fair normally I like to go for the er the train stations but would I really want a share in
A	erm I dunno
B	yeah that's
A	the Ikea in
B	okay erm I think you can you
A	yeah
B	but if you choose something that's based in here you become like the CEO
A	yeah I think it would be cool to have Ikea but I won't choose it purely because being CEO is way better like cos being store manager you're not your own boss you're just another
B	yeah
A	manager in an endless line of managers you've just got someone else telling you do this and then you're telling other people do this
B	yeah
A	and I don't really like that kind of bureaucracy personally
B	yeah
A	erm
B	you wouldn't enjoy the army then?
A	I wouldn't if I'm honest no the army's a little better because er the orders are kind of a bit more direct and
B	okay yeah
A	they have meaning
B	okay yeah yeah
A	whereas just working within retail I can tell you a lot of stuff that comes from up top and from managers is just completely useless
A	there is no need for it and this isn't in a sort of like sorry
A	erm so it would have to be CEO of a company
B	yeah cool place
A	but it would not bring in the money that like
B	okay yeah
A	no it's
B	yeah but hold on but in our in our discussion though it's not because you you would own
B	is it the
A	yeah so here's what I'd do is I'd become
B	okay that's a good er starting point for a discussion there what would you?
A	okay great
B	what would er what
A	what what games?
B	as in what games would you try and have there? would you have international rugby? international football? cricket?
A	everything
B	everything?
A	I would bid for everything get all of the money in
B	no but that means you have to spend a lot of money
A	have to spend money to get it
B	no that's more
A	yeah alright
A	so rugby international rugby yes
B	it's a real win
A	there's already a massive erm
B	yeah
A	demand for it for that stadium it's well known for it
B	yeah
A	so rugby definitely
B	okay
A	and not not much less than is currently being spent but much
B	okay
A	I think that
B	yeah
A	football
B	yeah and you've got
A	yeah I'd throw in a few bids here and there see if I get stuff on the cheap bit of a ninety-nine P
B	oh so I own the gas company not the stadium though
A	oh
B	but I will have shares in the stadium so as a shareholder I would
A	yeah
B	want to see them bid for erm international one days because that is such a good form of the game and it's the way the game's going and international T twenty so international T twenty probably more than one days because erm I'd put a lot of money into that and Glamorgan cricket club
A	yeah
B	er so for the international T twenties if we can host some
A	yeah
B	cos loads the TV crews come and everything and
A	yeah
B	nice pass
A	yeah cheers buddy mm
A	okay
B	like a really nice bar
A	yeah
A	er mate
B	yeah
A	erm
B	nice yeah good
A	it doesn't have the money in it but to be fair I'm currently
B	what about
A	I'm currently about twenty-six twenty-seven grand in debt? so you know some money is better than minus money
B	er yeah erm
A	you know what I think?
B	yeah
A	I'd be a lecturer at
B	ah really?
A	yeah purely
B	what
A	because like what I'd like to actually be is a writer but there isn't like
B	nice
A	you know with aims to be
B	I couldn't see that cos of the
A	I know that's why I threw it
A	with aims to becoming head of school
B	nice
A	like professor
B	oh I don't know I'm trying to walk through
A	oh nice
B	are we talking are we talking realistically?
A	no
B	erm
A	that was just a bad pass all round
B	not sure man
A	you're thinking rugby player or something aren't you?
B	well I was thinking just then I was thinking
A	nice
B	gonna meet a lot of interesting people
A	yeah
B	network erm
A	networking is your skill
B	or
A	yeah
B	erm just
A	nice
B	outside the
A	yeah
B	and to work as a
B	as a director there or something
A	nice
B	thirty minutes
A	half an hour yeah so head of hospitality or sports complex what did you say about the sports complex?
B	well I was gonna say a director of er
A	a director?
B	of er one of the initiatives or something
A	nice
B	it is but then lots of things are and it's just because it's the summer at the moment it's just whatever I whatever I get into really
A	yeah
B	and sport is big but I could equally be as into music or
A	that's true
B	so it's not it's not the only it's not the only interest in
A	oh
B	it goes
B	right let's er
A	shall we call it there or
B	got the
A	do you wanna
B	yeah let's call it there
A	carry on with that other section?
B	let's call it a day there I think
