B	I came out of class and there's me squatting on the floor trying to get this golden bug out of the line of fire
B	you know it's bound to be get squished
B	ain't it? er it was it was really beautiful it made my day so I had to try and get it up onto a piece of paper try and put it in the bushes and then
B	it was so shiny and beautiful erm and then I was gonna put it in the bushes and then it started flying at me you know those bugs
B	that erm you know the noise those really big bugs make?
A	yeah
B	and cos I
A	mm
B	those big beetles
A	yeah
B	their wings beat against their backs or something and they
B	so I was trying to rescue it and then it ended up flying right at me and I freaked out and started running away
B	all the students had dispersed by then
B	ah but one of the other lecturers walked past me and went oh what are you doing? and I went look at this beautiful bug
B	she went oh you're very kind
A	who was that?
B	mm I don't know I think she might've been a lecturer in a different department
A	oh
B	mm mm funny though that made my day that did all the rest of the bad luck I've had all this week
A	yeah you haven't had much good luck what other bad luck have you had?
B	well my computer not working the printer not working C drive not working not being able to access any of the materials on Tuesday they er oh god the list goes on erm I
A	mm
B	oh
A	yeah
B	I pulled the computer out broke the audio cable then there was just that
B	and a display screen it's just absolute oh it was just a nightmare then all of this emailing back and forth when I can't even get email on my computer can only get it through the internet
A	yeah
B	erm about the American student and all of that palaver which I think is sorted out now apparently none of the international engineering students do the listening and speaking component anyway I didn't know that did you? it's in the handbook
A	they don't do what?
B	I was like oh I didn't know that they don't do listening and speaking components
A	oh I thought that's what that whole email was about from
B	no that's what I didn't get no he was saying he was saying that erm
A	it's broken
B	they have to do whatever's in their schedules
A	yeah
B	but of course they didn't get their schedules till yesterday last night
A	okay
B	so they were all asking what am I here to do? and like you've got to have answers for them but they haven't even got their schedule yet so
A	mm

B	yeah look at you you're making a right mess of that
A	fucking get at it it doesn't go can't get it out
B	is it crunchy that biscuit bit? because
A	it's lovely but if you can get to it it's stupidly designed
B	you've just got to rip it
A	it's really pissing me off
B	you need to grow some nails
A	I've got I grow my nails
A	for the drums look it's ridiculous
B	you've grown your nails for the drums? I didn't know you did that
A	well a little bit yeah

A	it's stubble
B	can you not call it a moustache once it gets to a certain length?
A	it's not a moustache length is it?
B	it's in between a stubble length and a moustache length
A	well then I need a shave
A	oh I've got ice cream everywhere look the chocolate
B	here give that I'll put it in the bin oh you can't open
A	you can't open that one so how's your toe?
B	it's sore and I oh god
A	mm
B	to just before class I just thought when I couldn't print out the stuff and I was just like ah I've just had enough of bad luck this this week
A	yeah
B	day whatever and now this
A	mm
B	it was quite quick but it
A	how did what did they do? just pull it?
B	he smothered it oh er we need to ah bless
A	oh yeah
B	everything
A	yeah
B	he translated for me and everything
A	mm
B	erm they had to swab it all and alkalise it and then iodise it
B	used about a hundred iodine things and then they just pulled it off
A	right so they didn't give you and injection or anything?
B	they wanted to
A	yeah
B	but I had on written on a piece of paper from the clinic
A	yeah
B	she is breastfeeding
A	yeah
B	do not give her any drugs
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	anyway if you you don't
A	you don't need it do you? for that kind of thing
B	you don't need well it's just
A	just
B	it's yeah it's the initial pain
A	yank it off
B	and then
B	it's the soreness afterwards
B	you don't need painkillers for that do you? but oh my god I'm so pissed off
A	yeah well it's
B	I'm so pissed off because I can't wear toed shoes and now look now I don't have a toenail
B	oh I'm so pissed off I could cry really
A	yeah I know
B	honestly I was I had to hold it all in today
B	they take a year but that's you know what happened last time
A	yeah I know
B	they have to grow back perfectly
B	I'm sure it's the weakness from breastfeeding
A	I know
B	isn't helping
A	yeah
B	like
A	well your hair your nails it's all gone funny hasn't it?
B	I know I took I've been taking calcium and stuff and they feel when you go like that they feel pretty strong
A	yeah
B	but there's some sort of weakness
A	yeah
B	somewhere isn't there?
A	maybe it's not what else goes into nails?
B	I mean my fingernail is
A	yeah
B	erm maybe it's the keratin or something? like you've got keratin in your hair haven't you? my hair's actually stopped falling out so much
A	mm
B	it's not falling out but there's hardly any hair left to fall out look how thin it is
A	yeah but you haven't got any bald patches it still looks alright
B	no but can you remember? I know that you do grow a lot of hair your hair doesn't fall out when you're pregnant does it?
A	mm
B	so you get thick luscious hair but
A	mm
B	this is just ridiculous how much hair is falling out now
A	oh it's tough having a baby isn't it? all these things
B	you're telling me
B	you're telling me
B	well cos er I think cos the first few months you're focusing on your body getting better
A	mm
B	in other areas
A	right
B	your stomach needs to tighten up and like
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	stretched out
B	like you you're focusing on other areas so maybe I've been neglecting like hair and nails and I've just been brushing it hard and I don't know I need to just take a bit more care but that honestly wasn't my fault today I kicked the
A	mm
B	my foot went underneath the cabinet and my toenails went
A	ah I don't wanna know sorry I don't I just don't wanna
B	it must have just been at the right exact point of where my toenail is

B	mm
B	no
A	but he'd lost his glasses and he'd
B	he's got a key here why didn't he phone us?
A	he's got a key here?
B	he's got his key here
A	what do you mean?
A	has he got a spare key here?
B	yeah in the money box
A	what? in case he gets too pissed?
B	yeah
B	oh eleven twelve yeah yeah it wasn't late
A	so he had another four hours I was drunk
B	yep so was he when he went earlier?
A	yeah so he had another four hours of drinking on top of that
B	and then
A	yeah
B	her hanging out with
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean and that you know that wasn't any
B	well I suppose you can't make it a secret anyway if you're having lunch with someone it's plainly obvious isn't it?
A	mm
B	er
B	he he hates her hanging out with him
A	mm
B	he thought at her birthday party that he was trying to pinch her
A	mm
B	we had to move all the chairs around so that he sat
B	next to her instead of opposite
A	yeah yeah
B	oh that's not good honestly if
A	mm
A	mm
A	mm yeah but
B	but she's
A	yeah well
B	yeah probably
A	but she's too stubborn
B	but that hasn't helped
A	no well it's not
B	no it's not
B	well it was kind of her fault at the beginning because
A	yeah maybe
B	she was flirting with all the guys inviting them round to her house all the time
A	yeah
B	er
A	mm
B	you just don't do that
B	mm
A	mm
B	er invite people round at four in the morning
A	mm
B	er not when she's talking not when all she wants to talk about is shagging and tantra sex
B	mm
A	mm
B	so she caused those problems herself
A	mm
B	mm
A	anyway I spoke to her earlier and she said she wants to do something with you
B	yeah yeah
A	tomorrow so I think she's gonna phone you later
B	yeah cos I said to
A	mm
B	it's er the sky is blue nice
A	mm
B	nice and sunny
A	mm
B	I just want to go to the big hotel but I can't go swimming like this
A	mm
B	at the moment cos that would sting and it wouldn't be very nice for other people swimming in the swimming pool
A	why? they're not gonna be looking at your toe
B	no but well no but it's an open wound
A	oh yeah
B	you know? you'd have to have it's no you can't go swimming with an open wound can you?
A	no I wouldn't go in one of these local pools anyway
B	oh no I'm thinking of a big hotel
A	might get an infection
B	mm oh we'll do that soon enough won't we?
B	but
A	well it's been raining hasn't it? the last couple I think
B	yeah that's it it's been raining so the daytimes have been just disappearing
A	mm
B	haven't they?
A	mm
B	mm
A	I wouldn't mind going to the flower and animal market
B	yeah
A	which I've got written down somewhere
B	yeah
A	I think it's a fair way away
B	oh it doesn't matter cos you just get in a taxi
A	I don't know what kind of market it is I don't know if you'd be able to push a pram around in it
B	yeah
A	or whether it would be like one of those
B	it might be better to carry her and to take the carrier most er most people
A	yeah she's quite heavy now
B	well I was thinking er we could oh you've got
A	your
B	a bad back haven't you?
A	my back your toe
B	oh my toe
B	it won't er oh
A	no we need the pram
B	it will be alright tomorrow
A	yeah but we need the pram if
B	that's good that pram I already stubbed the other toe broke the other toe it's still not right
B	and that's on the same foot
A	you gotta stop kicking things
B	mm I don't mean to
A	have your feet grown or something?
B	they did say at the shoe shop that I had really big feet
A	well that's cos you're in
B	mm
A	mm
B	I really did miss her
A	mm
B	by the time it got to that last class I just like oh I just want to go home and my face was started dropping towards the end of the class
A	mm
B	and my voice started going a bit flat
B	cos I always try and make it quite uplifting but the students were going a bit downhill Friday afternoon five o'clock
A	no it's it's boring shit man
B	ah man
A	time management ah god it's just embarrassing teaching that
A	no
B	it's rubbish
A	no I just held up my smartphone and said you know how to use these
B	did you?
A	yeah I'm not patronising them
B	mm
A	I said look start using it booking in meetings and writing up your your deadlines and stuff on your phone
B	mm
A	like weekly things and
B	some people didn't wanna use their phones though
A	no I know
B	they're happy with their paper system
A	yeah mm well whatever I mean I don't that's not I don't think it's my job to teach that shit
B	well it's just skills
A	it's up to the university for fuck's sake they should you know? really?
B	but if they want a lecture on time management they should look in the schedule and go to a lecture on time management we
B	that's er that's so funny
A	huh? you're funny
B	oh
A	well done
B	erm yeah shouldn't some of these like time management all of this some of them be like er central workshops? like plagiarism
A	mm
B	okay everybody has to go
A	mm
B	to the plagiarism workshop
A	mm
B	and things like time management shouldn't they for freshers' week they have a choice?
A	yeah
B	of and a sign up?
A	yeah
B	like talking about Moodle sign ups sign up to a workshop
A	yeah
B	on time management
A	yeah
B	if that's what you want to to study
A	yeah
B	not if you're an international student
A	mm
B	like been in international schools all your life you don't need er
A	mm
B	don't need it anymore
A	yeah
B	they've grown up in a different way to us as well because with the computers I told my students oh my god we didn't have computers at at our uni
A	yeah we did
B	like not not in the class
A	oh no
B	like that
A	no no no
B	went to lectures we saw the slides er
A	no we didn't have projectors or anything did we?
B	we had a projector in the lectures
A	er in the lecture yeah it was
B	god
B	OHP
A	I think they were OHPs weren't they?
A	my undergraduate mm
B	I remember getting slides
A	yeah?
B	like a printout of Powerpoint slides
A	really? I never got that
B	but I think the printout of Powerpoint slides or notes we used to take notes next to something I can't remember but then we had to go on to the library on the computers and the most of the time the computers were busy nobody had a laptop
B	you had that massive desktop
B	with that humongous monitor
B	that took up the whole desk
B	oh my god
B	yeah and I told them at middle school I was the computer girl cos we had one computer in our middle school and that was the library computer
B	that every night was locked away and every night
B	I went in and got it
B	and I was like the computer girl
B	I had to set up the computer make sure the program was working for the library books
B	and it was new
B	and everyone was really excited we've got a new computer in school am I really that old? oh my god and I told them that erm
A	mm
B	was it second year I got a phone?
A	what? at uni?
B	yeah
A	erm
B	was it
A	yeah I well I didn't get mine
B	I got a phone off someone else it was definitely second hand phone that somebody gave to me
A	mm
B	so it wouldn't have been the first year
A	I didn't have one till after I left uni
B	no no I'm pretty sure it was after actually yeah
A	I didn't have one in
B	didn't you have a phone? cos
A	or maybe I did
B	I think you did
A	oh we did
B	you did and we shared a phone for a while
A	I think that's when I got it when we moved to
B	we'd never bought one though we just got
A	so I was what?
B	hand-me-downs
A	twenty when did when did I go to uni?
B	you went to uni
A	I was twenty
B	I went at twenty-one
A	twenty-one yeah me too
B	yeah twenty-one
A	no twenty I went when I was twenty you went
B	yeah you did the fourth year
A	so four so I didn't have a phone until I was twenty-five
B	yeah
B	yeah sounds about right yeah
A	oh god
B	so and because they've started the term really differently this time with the computers
A	mm
B	and I mean if they're bringing their computers every day in the
A	mm mm
B	erm it's just astonishing to
A	mm
B	the
A	yeah they've got the answers
B	yeah they've got the answers but I was telling them well next week you're not gonna have all the Powerpoints you'll get them after the lectures
A	mm
B	so they said well
A	don't really need them now
B	no I said you don't really need them
A	yeah
B	they've been taking notes erm if I gave them like
A	mm
B	and stuff like that they were all writing it in a Word document
A	mm
B	they weren't writing it in a notebook
A	mm yeah that's good but I mean for the reading and writing class they need to practise writing on paper
B	yeah well for their exam
A	yeah
B	yeah unless they make the exams all computer-based
A	yeah
B	they've gotta do more
A	it's not a bad idea really
B	well no you
A	I mean how much work is done handwritten now anyway? er in work environment
B	well it seems to make sense but you've got all the synonyms and stuff they want them to have learnt the vocabulary basically don't they? you can't test that on writing a Word document
A	no
B	unless there was some sort of computer program that makes you write and there's no no dictionary no spell check on the whole computer
A	mm well you can disable that
B	yeah but if you're in exam conditions you wouldn't have time to be disabling bits and bobs
A	no but you could
B	oh we could disable it before the?
A	yeah
B	yeah that's yeah that's what I mean you would have to
A	no anyway I dunno
B	well anyway I didn't well because I haven't looked at next week's lectures I I didn't
A	mm
B	ah I only told them to bring a writing book and then I
A	what writing book?
B	the RWAC writing book
A	oh well er what reading book?
B	the reading book
A	what reading book?
B	you know the little multi-coloured rainbow the red one
A	making connections?
B	yeah yeah that one
A	oh well they you don't need that in class do they?
B	er well
A	well
B	yeah there's a book quiz
A	ah yeah
A	oh that's gonna be fun ain't it? no one's gonna have their books and the lesson's all about the books
B	I'm gonna email them all and remind them
A	mm
B	and the additional work I'm gonna need to do
A	mm
B	I'm just going try and forget about this week
A	mm
