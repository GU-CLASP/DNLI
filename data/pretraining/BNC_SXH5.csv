A	okay so you were gonna tell me about what you learnt about recycling
B	I learnt that
A	mm?
B	there's so much plastic that in the sea which er and it could circle the
A	mm
B	and if it goes outside and I think don't think people are taking care then because I cos er today I see loads of wrappers everywhere
A	we did spot some rubbish didn't we? on the way back from school
B	yeah and
A	what?
B	animals can die of plastic
A	how can they die from plastic?
B	cos like if they've got a sharp bit of plastic or and it's fraying
A	mm
C	oh
A	yes
C	mm erm er maybe last year or the year before at some point people found a dead whale on the beach and they
A	mm?
C	and there was like a huge load of rubbish inside it
A	oh no really?
C	yeah it was swimming in the sea and it and it got all of it in its mouth and it died because of that so some er so some people have just been chucking their rubbish in the sea
A	well sometimes it ends up in the sea
C	yeah well they haven't been putting it away
A	but where does it go? cos you went to see where it rubbish goes didn't you
C	what on a school trip?
A	mm
C	nope
C	I might've but I don't remember it
A	do you guys know where the rubbish goes when it's collected?
C	yeah they go underground
A	it
C	yeah where they bury it
A	they don't bury it it's just there so
A	you know we have three different bins? what are the three different bins for?
B	they're for food
C	recycling
B	and
A	and
C	yeah
B	general waste
C	non-recyclable but not food
A	yeah
B	yeah mm mum?
A	and that's what goes to the landfill
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I think every bit of plastic we have like that container we recycle
A	we do although I think you can't recycle erm plastic if er if meat has been on it even if you wash it I can't remember
C	but I know a great way to get rid of plastic
A	mm?
C	dig down quite deep find some lava pour it on the plastic and it sizzles away
A	well that is a good theory actually perhaps we could all put stuff into a volcano
B	mum
C	no not into a volcano
A	I'm being serious
C	because er when it
A	mm?
C	then it might erupt and there will bits of plastic still left in the lava
A	no no it would it would burn but how do you think you can get to the lava without the lava coming up to us?
C	mm
A	you see?
C	exact timing
A	it's pretty well it's pretty dangerous isn't it?
B	yeah
C	some people have been near volcanoes
A	no no that's a good idea
C	unless the volcano did a gigantic spitting eruption which it where it goes kaboom then you'd probably be safe
A	why not
B	because mum some volcanoes are known to hold treasures in
A	known to hold treasure? are they?
C	no they're not you just watched Tom and Jerry
B	no I didn't
B	no some no I've heard that some volcanoes are so special that nobody puts anything in
A	I don't think I've ever heard that
B	well I've heard it
C	well I'm just going to ask a volcano expert about that
A	we did used to burn rubbish but then we realised that the burning was very bad for the environment yeah cos of carbon monoxide and things but if a volcano is already burning
C	for the air
A	maybe if you done dug a tunnel to the centre of the earth?
C	if we dug a tunnel to the centre of the earth
A	mm?
C	like really near to it
A	mm?
C	like close enough for us to drop it it's close enough for us to see the all the lava inside it or just to find some lava underground mm and then
A	mm?
C	they could drop the rubbish in and it would either sizzle away or explode
A	I think that would make for a very unstable tunnel though and it
C	what do you mean?
A	because of the heat and did you know the gravitational pull it does pull things into the centre of the earth so if we got too near people were digging they'd just get sucked into that bit
C	mm they
A	well how's that gonna happen?
C	cos they would go whee
A	I think it's a kind of quite a a dangerous option but
B	yeah
A	I don't want us to start recycling things because er well however we are going to keep this ketchup bottle because we're going to do that pancake recipe where you can do do two different types of pancake mixture so
B	hey
A	I guess we'll be reusing it that way mm?
B	we'd erm soon we might need to get my
B	might need to get a container for
A	for forest school? what do you need a container for?
B	you know the small container for drink
A	you just need a carton or a bottle but
B	mm
A	so it'll be you next half-term or the last half-term of school
B	or any half-term
A	I'll get you some water
B	thank you
A	sit down but dad's in charge of that because daddy is going to be taking you guys into school
A	I beg your pardon?
B	when is it?
A	it's this Thursday morning
A	it's not in one day's time because it's Monday today
B	oh yeah two days' time
A	in three days' time
B	no two days' time Monday
C	can I please have one of these after I've finished?
A	Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
C	how many?
A	erm one
B	oh
A	what about the blueberry the raspberry thingy muffin muffiny cake things?
C	mm
A	anything else you know about recycling?
C	uhu
C	it might be happening now
A	recycling?
C	yeah it'd be good if someone recycled
A	mm
C	something was at least being planned to recycle it and not just throw it away
A	well we don't as I say we're not allowed to just throw plastic away any more we have to put it in a recycling bin
B	yeah and erm on Thursday we found the plastic little ring and she was gonna put it in the bin and she said she'll put it in the mushroom bin and I said why not the erm the hippo bin? and she said because it's alive and get struck in its throat
A	the hippo bin
B	yeah and but that but that
A	oh dear
B	yeah
C	and what did she do?
B	she put it in the mushroom bin
A	well perhaps it isn't the best thing to have bins in the shape of animals
C	but anyway it was the most expensive one
B	yeah
A	was it?
C	yeah
A	how do you guys know that?
C	because the school councillors decided er decided it and it was mentioned in assembly
A	what? and they chose the most expensive one?
C	yeah the school councillors chosen the most expensive one
B	I want to be a school councillor

A	oh
