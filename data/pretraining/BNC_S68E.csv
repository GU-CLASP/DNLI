A	might be years
B	apparently like he's already got permission?
A	yeah
A	erm yeah I remember you were saying that
B	er mm yeah
C	mm
B	so mm
A	mm yeah
C	it weren't obvious was it?
B	yeah no
C	cos like he didn't want to sell it
B	and then all of a sudden he he realised it was for sale
C	too little too late
B	and er he wanted to buy it it's too late it's gone now
C	he was being funny the for sale sign was there for months
B	he he probably yeah cos it was it's not actually sticking out it is
A	yeah yeah
B	it's flat on the window so if you
A	well even I noticed it so?
B	I know but he drives in the car doesn't he Mr
C	I've seen him walking down the street before
B	me too
A	I see now he realises if I walk I might see any for sale signs
B	yeah too late yeah it's gone mm never mind
C	no mm unless he can find out who's bought buying it and have a good
A	make a better offer
C	it's never too late is it?
B	mm
A	mm yeah I think by the fire station they're building something because I saw them remember opposite you know the fire station and gym
B	yeah
A	and there's a bit of waste ground and the old ruin of a pub
B	oh I know yeah
A	and it was just always fenced off
B	yeah
A	and just waste ground but today when I went passed they were digging it up so I think they're they're laying foundations
B	oh are they?
B	I wonder what that's going to be?
A	be more flats cos obviously they've got two rows of flats
C	yeah
A	and then the new ones further down the road
B	yeah
C	yeah mm
B	mm
A	yeah that was always a horrible spot anyway so
B	mm
A	kids throwing stones at you just climbing up before they put the fence round it
A	yeah and they said they we can't do anything about it because it's all the housing was council housing but the pub belonged to whatever and then all the breweries et cetera changed ownership
B	yeah
A	so nobody could trace who actually is in charge of the building and therefore could be made liable and I think either it was a change of law or if you can say that it's been not cared for for so many years and the council can step in and that's when the put the fence up
B	yeah oh I see
A	but it took it took and obviously loads of people must have complained
B	you walked down there with
C	yeah two little shits they weren't even bothered they were just chucking stones at us
A	yeah yeah
C	they soon bloody complained when we started throwing them back
B	to them
A	well especially if you hit them
B	yeah
C	well not cos they'd been throwing stones to hit us you know what I mean? they should bloody get their aim better
A	mm
B	mm
C	yeah and they started swearing at us then I said see you later have a nice day it winds them up more doesn't it though when you're not being nasty to them
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well as I said when once the fence went up that that seemed to quieten down and it used to be a lot more you know the kind of stuff that I got thrown at me was like the the worst one once was a pie
B	a pie?
A	yeah it half missed me but it just got me
C	no
B	what kind of pie?
A	a meat pie?
A	good thing it didn't land in my face
C	imagine
B	yeah open it
C	could have been one of them
B	yeah put a bit of sauce on it next time
A	yeah chicken next week
B	chicken next week
C	I know they'd have all the tramps walking passed won't they? any pies mate any pies?
B	no a pie oh gosh
C	that's really random
B	mm I've had a egg thrown at me and it actually got me a few years ago when I was young I was running round to my nans and this other girl threw an egg at me right on my head
A	apparently it is good for your hair
B	yeah and all my cousins ran after her then she went ah I didn't know
C	it doesn't matter they'll never be consequences
B	she tried to yeah she run off to the flats absolutely petrified and
C	oh god she could always tell a tale
B	yeah mm gosh

A	yeah
B	you'd get eggs the car would be
C	no but for years
B	mm
C	I think it's not cool any more is it really?
A	but you don't even see penny for the guy
B	no
C	you do
A	mind you a penny would be not really good would it yeah there you go
C	a pound for the guy
B	yeah a pound for the guy
A	a tenner for the guy yeah you must be joking
C	you see tenner for the guy's wearing more like fancy clothes than I am
B	yeah
C	I might just sit next to them
B	ah god

C	ooh you've got the Harry Potter books
A	yes
C	I'm reading them for the third time now
A	it's the it's I was amazed how much I forgot about the first book because they did that then they did the the Christmas one remember Stephen Fry was reading it over Christmas the whole book took eight hours so you could just listen to bits and pieces
B	no I didn't watch that
A	and when the last book had come out and I read it I thought I'll read the whole thing again as one
C	or listen to it yeah well I've never I read them all when I was at school and then I read them again at secondary school when Deathly Hallows
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	no Goblet of Fire Deathly Hallows is it?
A	yeah
C	part one
E	wouldn't you rather just watch the film?
C	well I've never I've only watched the first four films and now I've got them all I've read all the books and bought the last book
E	yeah
C	so I've nearly finished the second to last book and the last book arrived in today's post
A	well that was the other thing I said we I said to er cos
A	she didn't she used the translations and she looked at the translations how and how they were compared to the original so you know the Harry Potter references should definitely work for her
B	oh
C	mm love Harry Potter I don't know what I'm going to read after I've finished Harry Potter
E	read them all again
C	mm
A	Philip Pullman that's Harry Potter for adults well it's for older children you know the the Dark Dark Materials
C	oh okay ah I'll have to have a look into that
A	there's the Dark Materials and then there's the Lucy I keep forgetting it was the they did it on the BBC
C	I prefer reading a book before I go to bed rather than watching the telly
A	yeah okay
C	I wear I got the train down to
A	Sally Lockhart
C	Sally Lockhart
A	it starts with The Ruby in the Smoke and it erm The Amber Spyglass and again that's a film with the James Bond guy and it's
C	never watched James Bond
A	yeah the guy what's his name? he's from Heswall or Hoylake?
C	the guy who plays James Bond?
A	yeah
C	I don't know
A	anyway
C	I've never watched that or Lord of the Rings
A	but yeah there is the film that is called The Golden Compass but it's it's Philip Pullman he's written for very little children as well and you can tell the books are really different
B	god
C	well when you read the first Harry Potter book you can literally read it within like half a day like that
A	yeah and it just
C	and then it goes that that
A	the second one is slightly more and then you have a doorstopper in the end
C	no but the the Goblet of Fire is like that as well
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
C	massive book that
A	which one is your least favourite?
C	erm
A	is it Harry Potter five?
C	it's second to last
A	yeah second to last
C	is it four five no one two three four five six
A	six oh
C	yeah hold on
A	is it six? hang on let me check I always thought it was number five that I didn't like
C	number five is
A	erm is it the Order of the Phoenix?
C	yes
A	yeah
C	that's the one I'm reading now
A	that's the biggest
C	it's the one I'm reading now but it's a bit
A	yeah because nothing happens really
C	it just stretches on and on and on I'm at I'm at the end I'm at the end of it now and it's a bit like there's no action whereas all the other ones are action packed
A	yeah I felt this one was she got too influenced by the films that's what it felt like
C	yeah and that Umbridge does my head in
A	well that's the whole idea isn't it?
C	I hate her in real life she's only a character in a book
A	she is she is modelled on Maggie Thatcher
B	oh mm
A	but yeah but I mean that's the kind of teacher you certainly do not want it's like ah ah
C	I know it's mad isn't it? I don't know how she gets away with it it's the only book that really really annoys me
A	yeah and then of course she comes back
C	mm I know I can't I can't really remember reading the last book
A	mm
C	I have done but it ages and ages ago and I can't remember that's why I'm reading it again and then I'm going to watch all the films

E	yeah
B	is she there?
A	can't remember it's it's it's not
C	somewhere in Liverpool essentially
B	mm mm
A	might be just because of the hours
C	yeah
A	mm
B	well every time the lads go away back home to Yemen
A	yeah
B	they come over with presents for us don't they?
A	yeah
B	all of them are lovely I've had two necklaces off them a key ring
E	the Quality Street and all that
B	yeah charms to go on your keying and
C	and like the basic holiday stuff but it's always really unusual and different it's not like a Yemen you know it's not like a key ring with the Yemen on it
B	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	it's always sort of different
B	unusual isn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm well they're lovely
C	mm
A	yeah Yemen is a dangerous place
B	mm
A	violent
B	is it?
C	everywhere is though
A	well not not quite as much as there
B	did you hear what happened to us the other Friday well a couple of weeks ago wasn't it now?
B	and then he was going on about flying the Somalian flag you will know about it and so the taxi men was saying well yeah whatever that that he'd break his jaw and all that and the next minute he run round and he tried to get in the driver's side and he was going on about the London bombing
A	does he know the taxi driver?
B	no I was going drive on drive on
A	it is yeah
B	you wouldn't expect them I mean I've always felt safe and secure
A	oh yeah
B	and it was just like something what you'd hear in London or you know somewhere crazy
A	yeah
B	it's just like out of character really
A	mm
C	mm
B	mm frightening
A	yeah doesn't bear thinking really does it?
B	no it's like they're brainwashed
A	well that's what it is it's it's it's there is only one way of thinking and it doesn't go with the mainstream
B	no
A	erm and the the thing is they you know the it's you know if you look at ISIS they say the ISIS they they use basically all the people who come from abroad and
B	mm
A	mainly from the UK and and France they use them as cannon fodder they're the ones who become suicide bombers all the locals they do the stuff where you don't get killed
B	yeah yeah
A	it's just they're just naïve
B	sad
A	yeah it's one very odd interpretation of the book
B	mm
A	mm how did we get to that one then?
B	me
B	yeah oh mm
A	mm on that note
B	yeah what can we talk about now?
C	dunno
A	holidays we've covered
B	mm
C	anything springs to mind mother
A	how is your dad anyway? I I've seen him obviously
B	who my dad?
A	yeah
B	he's not very good today to be honest
A	oh yeah
B	it brings all takes all the dust and things like that erm he's got the hospital soon and I think he's really worried about it
A	what has he has he difficulty breathing at the moment?
B	yeah he's got erm emphysema
A	oh
B	so your lungs have got like little sub things on it so all my dad's
A	which makes your lungs basically have very small
B	yeah my dads have all died sort of thing so they want to cut the top of his lung off but then he's worried about going under anaesthetic the way he is erm
C	and being in hospital
B	yeah and being in hospital because if he catches anything he's got no immune system whatsoever now he can't really he walks from my mum's house to mine and then that's it he's gasping for his breath he come round the other day and he sat on the doorstep before you you can't speak to him because he's
A	he's out of breath shocking
B	and it's awful because I mean he's worked all his life and he has to buy his own nebuliser his own like breathing machine what he puts his tablet it he has to buy that it's so wrong
A	yeah
B	so he's he's like he's getting really wound up about the hospital appointment because he thinks he's getting used for a guinea pig
C	it sounds like he is
B	yeah they've never done this this operation they want to do on him is new
A	mm
B	and he's saying
C	so he is a guinea pig really
B	yeah he's saying basically he's worried about it and if I do if I go in and erm they'll stop all my money because you have to tell erm you know where he gets his money from well he doesn't get loads of money like some people get all kinds don't they? he just gets like the basic wife sick pay and he said you have to tell them and they stop your money and you start all over again well mum and dad are no good at paperwork and
A	no yeah
B	applying for this and applying for that
C	it's all on the computer now isn't it anyway?
B	well he can't they can't really use one can they? so that's another big thing so and they have to come out so as to reassess you again you have to go through the process
C	I don't think it's worth it
A	yeah
B	I know but he is he is getting worse
A	yeah
C	yeah but it's not like he's fifty will he see the benefit from it?
A	that's the thing having having having a massive operation
B	he's seventy-two now
C	I said to that to my grandad I said will you be with it being your age are you are you definitely guaranteed a benefit because you're not doing brilliantly now but you're not doing as bad as you could be
A	that's what I mean with a with a massive operation like that the
C	is it worth the worry?
A	they would really think you know we we do that with a younger person but not with
B	he gets
A	well you can you can just imagine what it must be like I don't want to think about any of that
B	he was always a mechanic my dad so he always worked in like factories on the you know the remember the old Scofield wagons and
A	yeah
B	things like that was my dad's job he was a mechanic and then he worked in Ford's Leyland's he's always worked
E	mm mm on cars and that
B	yeah on cars and that and then years ago my dad used to smoke as well
A	mm
B	so probably the combination of the two
C	I bet you the places were full of asbestos as well
A	yeah the dust and
B	yeah yeah has like killed his lungs basically and they're saying this operation they want to do something about your valves as well inside you
C	oh yeah they're
B	trying to enlarge them
C	they enlarge the valves
B	the but my dad said how will that erm be beneficial to me he said because my lungs have like gone
