A	what's it like then that beer?
B	um
A	it's pretty cheap though
B	percent and it's
A	malty
B	bit malty yeah
A	ah
B	got that sort of richness
A	hey what's that badge?
B	sorry? Is that good or bad?
A	oh Russia
B	yeah it's it's written in Russian script isn't it if you look there you've got the Russian B
A	so what's that  what's that  letter there?
B	that's L
A	that J? Is it attached to there?
B	it
A	oh right
B	looks a bit like a lambda
A	and then that H is an I?
B	yeah that's right yeah that's a capital E sound yeah yeah so E
A	that's really confusing like
B	K A the same
A	that looks like a B
B	it's confusing because there's another B in Russian
A	is there?
B	yeah which is which looks the same as our B but it's pronounced V
A	like a capital B?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	um
A	I know there's the like some backwards don't they like? The backwards N?
B	yeah like
A	is it N it's N?
B	yeah like like a T is  T is  like a M when it's small I think
A	mm
B	the their their small T isn't like our small T
A	oh so you mean the? Oh right
B	lower case yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	which looks like a W
A	yeah
B	and then there's um Shch which has a sort of um
A	it looks good
B	oh um
A	is it Thai or is it?
B	Thai has uh circles and they look sort of like they're attached to they look like little tadpoles I suppose like sort of got strings attached to them
A	little what? Right
B	so it looks somehow similar to tadpoles
A	oh tadpoles? I thought you said something  I thought you said something  else
B	ah no um
A	yeah anyway so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Thai's quite hard I think because it has letters that that don't have a sound like
A	and Arabic as well like
B	ah yeah well the
A	dunno how you could get used to that
B	one of the main problems with Arabic is that a lot of the vowels aren't written down
A	yeah
B	uh and sometimes the vowels are symbolized with a tiny little uh underscore like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	um and also Arabic has some confusion because the the start of the word and the end of the word and the middle of the word
A	yeah
B	and
A	what d'you mean?
B	all have different forms of the letter
A	oh right right
B	A letter has
A	I think it looks really nice
B	um and that also happens a bit in Hebrew as well
A	I do like the look of it but I dunno if I would ever be able to like understand it or anything
B	arabic? No I don't think it's that it's not that bad it's not as hard as like um
A	no I had a friend who went to uni
B	uh it's not as hard as Thai I would've thought
A	I had a friend who went to uni who'd done like
B	yeah to become she ended up becoming working in the in diplomacy or something
A	like she's from
B	what American Congress?
A	yeah
B	that's really
A	she's a bit of a high flyer
B	um
A	and also um
B	oh excellent
A	oh the Russian?
B	cyrillic script
A	so what do?
B	but they don't speak a language related to Russian they speak their own
A	ah
B	the uh the drunk man's leaving
A	what are them old fellas doing?
B	ay?
A	what are you?
B	well no I I just assumed he was drunk cos he's normally drunk when I see him
A	oh that guy
B	um
A	well I know that like when me me Granda had a stroke and he sounded pissed all the time
A	I think it was because I think it wasn't like
A	he didn't think any different he said like obviously once he was better he was saying like he still felt the same but he was it couldn't come out of his mouth like
B	yeah it's horrible to feel like you're sort of trapped like that like um
A	yeah
B	you can't uh
A	like our neighbour
B	was that in the
A	it's in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	ah
A	must be really scary
B	actually yeah cos I sometimes see them through the  see them through the  kitchen window sometimes
A	oh yeah what's his
A	oh he's quite annoying
B	Boastful
A	he really does like a burst sausage face
B	uh
A	sausage face yeah
B	that's not a good combo combination uh
A	is he the one who like paints his nails?
B	no that's a different one
A	oh right
A	maybe we come here too often if we're like that guy
B	he
A	no
B	uh but uh yeah I do there are a few regulars that I know that come here obviously
A	well you just see people don't you like it's the same anywhere you live you sort of get to see people
B	yeah I mean
A	there was a few people I recognized in the shop this morning
B	yeah from round the area I mean
A	it's a really weird mix though like
B	yeah
A	and like people buying cans of
B	yeah um
A	like tramps it's cos of that tramp shelter thing
B	there's a  there's a  couple of uh them sorts of halfway houses or whatever local shelters
A	must be really weird like
B	uh
A	I just don't know how you could I mean I like beer and everything but I don't know how you could face like a a Special Brew at like what time was in there? Like ten AM or something
B	well it's the sort of need for it isn't it the the uh dependency
A	but I was reading somewhere that like that cheap
B	dependence on it
A	I I don't mean like cheap booze like a in like you know deals on drinks or whatever I mean like serious like cheap really hard like that hard cider and like Frosty Joe's or whatever it's called and
A	D'you know what I mean White Lightening
B	uh Frosty Jacks um
A	frosty Jacks
B	White Lightening and then obviously the like
A	and the Special Brews and the super all the super ones yeah
B	so so I mean it's it's what is it like a pound a can or it's like nine percent or so?
A	but I watched a it's awful like I watched a programme saying that like that's the biggest threat it's not like
B	it's a terrible strain on the NHS isn't it?
A	it well it is but I mean you're not
A	what they doing?
B	I'd like a Campari and soda
A	exactly
B	um
A	but I watched a programme where they were like it was like a wet hostel so they were allowed to drink but they were basically these old fellas all basically dying
A	like with alcohol poisoning and um just sitting there like
B	yes cos they're locked in a cycle aren't they because they're
A	it's like worse
B	if you if you're dependent on it and you've got
A	people were saying it's it's worse than
B	uh
A	well the same
B	it's it's difficult because then they would have the decision of whether to be teetotal or not
A	but they that's the thing they can't some of them like
B	if they go back on it then
A	it it knacks them like
B	yeah it can be a bit dangerous can't it yeah like
A	if you've drank
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	uh part of it is you've got to
A	I think if you're that bad
B	you've got to sort of be able to sober up for a bit
A	I think if you're that bad you've you've gotta be like managed off it like
B	yeah I mean it's just that discipline isn't it? And it's to do with self-control isn't it?
A	Cos is that not what happened to Amy Winehouse like
B	I'm not exactly sure what happened with her but uh
A	it's such a shame though
B	she probably got that died of alcohol poisoning but she
A	well but
B	you can die of  you can die of  being off it as well cos the body  the body  uh is used to it and um
A	the shock? What's it called again? Thingybob tremens
B	so it gets all and delirium tremens is the  is the  shakes
A	that's right yeah
B	but but you get um
A	but I was reading
B	but because alcohol goes in goes into I think every cell in the body
A	yeah
B	it goes it enters every single cell so every single cell all types of cells and obviously the nervous system the muscles
A	damaged
B	all the cells are gonna be slightly altered in their uh behaviour by having alcohol in them so
A	yeah
A	well no but
B	no it's funny well it is a drug isn't it? It's a hard  it's a hard  drug it's it's a psychoactive drug isn't it so uh
A	I think they should put the prices up of those like of well all in fact all beer really as much as I like it
B	yeah well
A	yeah
B	and these people are in some sense being kept alive by by the state um and yeah
A	yeah
B	well
A	no I know that
B	well some of the other would've actually said that a better policy might be to legalize certain drugs because um it brings them in  it brings them in  to you can get tax revenue so it shrinks your black market and it possibly shrinks gang activity as well
A	no but does does it not like just move those people like who are vulnerable onto something else like?
B	I don't know if you change I they would change it because of that I mean
A	well I
B	I think if they legalized it more people would take it but that would mean that less people would take alcohol which would take alcohol money away from the uh
A	yeah
B	take alcohol money
A	yeah
B	Holland and uh and I think they've they've done it in uh they've done stuff in Portugal
A	I know but it's been
B	no I think it is technically illegal but they just tolerate it
A	well actually when we were there were were they not changing it? I know they were changing it like I remember seeing signs in the shops saying that you couldn't buy magic mushrooms there
B	uh yeah I mean I don't really see why you would wanna ban magic mushrooms um
A	well
B	personally but that's
A	yeah but marijuana grows naturally and it's so they could grow that
B	not in  not in  England it doesn't
A	oh right yeah
B	it requires uh like
A	yeah cultivation
B	you know they have to
A	get them UV lamps
B	you see the programmes don't you? You see them with the whole house with like uh full plants a
A	that's crazy isn't it when they strip the everything out of the house
B	they've gotta the the radiators then
A	yeah yeah the UV lights
B	uV lights and well also well infrared you know heat
A	yeah
B	energy is needed um and you need to buy
A	yeah
B	got to uh water them so I mean and they put like proper farmers you know proper like sprinklers and that
A	the irrigation systems yeah yeah
A	I know I've seen them on those like police police things
B	legalization would bring a lot of it would shrink the black market for that cos there's a lot of money in uh cannabis as you know there's uh often often smell whiffs of it as I walk down round here in this uh student area like
A	it's quite studenty
B	um well I think it's uh I think it's it's not
A	yeah
B	um
A	well I don't know
B	well compared to for example alcohol which is just notoriously uh dangerous and
A	yeah
B	causes numerous accidents and massive strain on the NHS
A	it's funny isn't it how like
B	well it's funny I think think we've been drinking
A	Cos people always drank beer haven't they? From the word go
B	from the year dot
A	yeah small beer
B	well the
A	yeah
B	alcohol
A	but all those other ones
B	MDMA what is that uh?
A	and like acid and E
A	no MDM
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	I don't know about ecstasy I mean there was that thing wasn't there when there was uh a guy called Mr Nutt
A	mr what?
A	right
B	and he uh and he said that ecstasy was less dangerous than horse riding
A	oh
B	and and um there was a massive  there was a massive  media storm about that and uh
A	I know who that was
B	government government
A	I know but it doesn't do any good saying things like that
B	I don't know
A	but that not just mean that more people have died riding a horse than have done? That doesn't mean it's necessarily more dangerous
B	I think it  I think it  does like
A	Cos you can't equate the number of people with
B	uh
A	the amount of people that ride horses versus the amount of people who do drugs or whatever
B	why not?
A	I mean did he do that?
B	it's like it's more dangerous to go like on a parachute it's more dangerous to go like um Formula 1 racing than it is for example to play uh to play chess
A	I know I get his point he was saying
B	I think more people have died
A	well that's probably
B	so therefore Formula One racing's more dangerous than than chess
A	dunno you could have some wild chess games
B	although you could  you could  have some like
A	extreme chess have you seen extreme ironing
B	I've seen  I've seen  chess and boxing played together
B	where which where you you use your brain and then you bash your brain
A	what was that on?
B	it was in Germany and I don't know what it was on but
A	I saw something
B	it was on  it was on  uh on the box and uh
A	I saw a similar thing actually yesterday I was watching a programme about the US Coast Guard in the Caribbean and like they're doing their training where they make them do all kinds of physical exertions
B	right
A	similar to like boxing chess
B	that's um
A	just crazy
B	I watched a bit of boxing yesterday actually
A	he's got such a funny lisp
B	Chris Eubank Junior uh who looks quite similar to Chris Eubank
A	yeah
B	there was like two points in it
A	Chris Eubank's funny isn't he? Did you see all that stuff on the news? Did you see it there? It was just on the TV
B	he's a strange  he's a strange  guy
A	about what happened after that the other fight that was on? The that Russian fella
B	oh yeah that was in the news wasn't it today um? Russian the the sort of
A	I think I I sort of knew he was gonna get beat
B	but then the used to be the two English ones actually started scrapping afterwards or something
A	David
B	is it super heavyweight or?
A	uh
B	it's funny isn't it? Mind you you can be  you can be  polite but evil can't you?
A	well I think he was I mean he's obviously like a fighter so he's obviously used to like git punching people in the face and that but um
B	cold cold blooded
A	but but then the other guy
B	well it reminds me of uh
A	and he just got totally sat down like in the fight
B	reminds me uh
B	although he was apparently
A	um
B	well I think that's just a cultural thing uh I think in Britain and maybe America too they expect
A	but anyway
B	they expect the boxers to to have this kind of like bravado sort of thing
A	but anyway this other guy this other um
B	like wrestling I suppose isn't it where wrestlers sort of insult each other and it seems to be rather choreographed doesn't it?
A	yeah but it's not like
B	they shouldn't uh it it it's well it is it's making them like cos they say that boxing is supposed to provide discipline isn't it to to sort of people on the street uh who might otherwise be getting dragged down into crime and general general ridiculous behaviour
A	well he bottled him
A	so there's two two separate  two separate  English guys fought these two brothers on two separate occasions
B	yeah
A	one of the occasions was last night when
B	yeah yeah
A	and went for him and punched him in the face
B	bit strange innit? It's like you don't think it's choreographed?
A	and then this other British guy said he's gonna shoot him
B	so what happened to the discipline? I mean cos some of them like Amir Khan um
A	I mean I don't know that much about boxing except for Tony Jeffries obviously
B	Amir Kahn seems to be reasonably reasonably well behaved doesn't he?
A	yeah
B	um
A	I think it's bad like
B	who wouldn't shake whose hand?
A	so um
B	no you're not you're really good at remembering foods and uh parts of the body
A	that's me specialist subject
B	anatomy and anatomy and food terms
A	but that's that's cos I like eating
B	like pancetta
A	yeah
B	I've remembered that but
A	no no
B	there's a lot of that in like
A	he was banned for however many months
B	what was that one's name again the one who wouldn't shake his hand?
A	I can't remember
B	isn't Everett? Isn't that one? Isn't um one of them like notoriously bad like thugs or something or is that someone else?
A	I don't know but
B	like two brothers like
A	no
B	the brother was like in prison and
A	I don't know
B	did he use to play for Newcastle?
A	yeah he's horrible
B	they're their family's like they've got a just a
A	they're chavs
B	just a bad family haven't they? Wrong 'uns
A	ah
B	wrong 'uns
A	no but this was really bad cos like it's a really bad message
B	it's it's it's a
A	yeah
B	bit of uh
A	bit of singing
B	action over there
A	I was reading something in in the uh paper this morning where they were saying like on the subject of like racism and football
B	yeah
A	um
B	right
A	I mean people just aren't
B	yeah the I mean there are some the football's always been an area some of the unpleasant parts of society sometimes uh you know
A	yeah
B	rear their head like in the the crowd
A	just so stupid
B	obviously various uh extreme uh opinions such as dislike of gays or dislike of women or dislike of uh people with different skin colour and stuff like that in football
A	it's just stupid isn't it? I can't understand it at all
B	but uh at least I think it's improving though
A	yeah
B	I think think we
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	um
A	I dunno I'm terrible
B	hold on
A	oh yeah that's right
B	they beat them Uh we watched obviously we watched Arsenal and Inter Milan which was
A	that was a good match
B	which was a really great match uh
A	I knew Sunderland would win you know
B	I mean um
A	I really thought that they would win
B	but yeah that game was between Sunderland and Arsenal was a result but I mean
A	yeah
B	uh which is like something that um
A	I I really thought they would win
B	but often the passing you know right back to the defenders and the goalkeeper um
A	maybe they can win the whole cup that'd be good
B	uh
A	okay I'm alright I don't want one but
B	bar if you want one uh
