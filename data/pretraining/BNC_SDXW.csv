A	how the other dog went and fetched him and
B	oh it's extraordinary that that I've never
A	friendship
B	I've never seen anything quite like
A	mm
B	I opened the door he jumped up straight into the seat
C	did he?
B	he can't see at all can he?
C	no
A	oh right
C	well he got
B	I know that
B	that's the thing the sofa
C	and and we got some wood for you
B	have you?
A	that's
C	yeah
A	those doors you said you wanted it for something
C	you said you want them doors yeah well you'll see em anyway
B	oh that's what I was thinking of putting the
A	you don't want them now do you?
B	well
C	yeah
B	but I've found a solution for the winter cos I just in my I just work in my lounge
C	well yeah it's the best thing
A	yeah
C	you can do
B	erm and that that's better than trying to heat up another area isn't it?
C	well of course it is yeah
B	erm
A	no
C	that
B	so
C	you can't get two
B	mm?
C	stuff? that's not toxic the stuff you use the
B	my
C	oh I see yeah
B	she says I really should have a erm a fume cabinet that exhausts out through a tube
C	oh I see
B	erm and I could build one of those quite simply actually
C	yeah
B	so I can
A	oh
B	erm sometimes my eye used to sting a little bit but
C	no
B	every time I've done a little glass with etching on for somebody for a wedding or something they love it you know
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	I did one for
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but well they couldn't do that and I didn't know about that what they wanted so I made just a little tank glass
A	yeah
B	and that apparently is in the middle of their mantelpiece and they and they think it's wonderful
A	yeah lovely
B	but the effort required
C	oh what the
C	we don't have one
C	no
B	no I bought that's where I bought these glasses from and they were really cheap
A	yeah glasses
B	I bought I bought a sort of a quite a stack of them I've still got some up in the loft
B	yeah Ikea
C	Ikea that's the one
B	and and then but then from the point of view I just draft it out cut out get a stencil with my sign writing stuff stick it on the glass
C	yeah
B	dig out a bit smooth it on smooth it on
A	oh
B	quarter of an hour
A	mm
B	cos that's that's not been used
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	you wipe it all off erm the
A	lovely
B	it's a lovely
C	well you do you get yeah
B	mm
C	well you'd have to wear a mask yeah
B	well everyone's always thrilled whenever I do one and it's so simple
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	right
B	and erm
C	oh that's some kind of acid isn't it that's gotta be
B	yeah
C	an acid thing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	I think it's nitric acid actually or something
A	you can wear a mask can't you?
B	I do
A	oh
B	yeah I do wear a little mask
C	yeah
A	that's alight
C	one one of them little face masks
B	mm but I couldn't find the goggles last time so I did em without the goggles my eyes did
B	so yeah why are we talking about that? cos I I
A	erm
B	what led on to that?
C	I don't know
B	I
C	oh yeah
A	no
B	they're small doors
C	we're talking about the doors that fit on units and stuff like that little kitchen unit things
B	I use
A	you you asked for er like a just a piece of wood really
B	oh that was for plonking my I
A	right yeah
B	I found the wires were long enough
C	oh I see yeah you weren't gonna
B	that that was
A	mm
B	quite amazing the
A	yeah
B	cos I tried first running erm from the phone outlet
C	yeah
B	there
C	oh I see yeah
B	and it worked
C	oh
B	and actually we found out that one of their speakers hadn't been working for years
C	mm
B	it was painted over and the last time that was painted was donkey's years ago
C	yeah
B	the other half had been eaten at some stage
C	we we've gotta chuck some speakers away did you want any speakers?
B	oh don't chuck speakers please
A	yeah
B	cos if I could fix up speakers in the church and just plug in that'd save me two things
C	just check
B	organist at York Minster
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and he erm he
A	oh
B	was started there the year I finished the job he was getting on a bit but erm he did one CD which is popular hymns
C	yeah
B	and then starts it
B	and it's beautifully done you could actually hear him moving the stocks
A	oh
B	it's MP3 so it plays on that
C	yes
B	online
C	yeah
B	and erm so I I did that for the hymns using these speakers
C	yeah
B	erm and then at the end we got right to the end and I played a voluntary
C	wow
A	oh
B	and the moment I stuck that on at the end of the service
C	yes
B	but when the voluntary came on
A	mm
B	he didn't associate that with anything electronic
C	oh
B	he said er who's playing the organ
C	oh
B	and isn't that lovely?
A	yeah
B	so it obviously suited because it's must've sounded like that little organ in there
C	oh
A	oh
B	yeah
C	how is he is he is he
B	oh yeah he's he's alright
C	is he?
B	he's a little bit uncertain on his feet
C	yeah
B	er
A	mm
B	or well actually about three hours last time I think
C	yeah
B	and erm so it's good to sit with
C	yeah
A	mm
C	you said you were gonna send me updates for the church you know
B	yes I well well what what I'd like to do
C	well that's it yeah
B	and I could leave them there that would be good and then I just
C	they about that big?
B	oh that's lovely I
A	we've got several actually I was
B	if I run the wires the wires to the back of the church
C	yeah
B	or just to where I'm sitting will be fine
C	yeah
B	where I normally sit to that pew
C	yeah
B	and then
C	they've got little flips and
B	oh that's superb so I just need just need to get some wire
B	any old
C	yeah
B	electrical wire would do that won't it?
C	well course it would
A	mm
C	I think I've got some actually
B	have you? if you've got some of that as well
C	mm
B	then I just gotta take that bit that be lot easier
C	that would work yeah
B	and it's only
A	yeah
B	but that think that's over the top
C	yeah
B	erm
C	well we've got so our
C	I've got speakers in in the in the shed you see
A	well you can still do that if you want you've still got speakers haven't you?

C	and you got all different er you got radio you got music you got this that
B	well I haven't made the radio work she didn't have an aerial for it

C	no
A	no
B	oh
C	what have I got? I I I put in a bit of coaxial

C	yeah that's one of em that's one of em
B	but I can you can buy them for ten pounds
A	yeah
B	erm I haven't been able to find these little speaker you know they look like BT connectors don't they?
C	see this?
B	mm?
C	that's the aerial
B	oh just a piece wire like that
C	just a bit of wire
B	but what's that one you got on top?
C	that plug in with that look
B	well see that's the thing where do you get one of them from?
C	well
B	oh that is see that's not a normal coax thing is it it's
C	no that's not that's just a lump of wire but
B	yeah
A	that's what came with it isn't it?
C	so I
B	well see the one you got sitting on top the aerial on top?
C	yeah
B	I don't know what that's for but I've seen one of those for ten pound new
C	well I shan't get it cos that don't work don't do anything
B	oh okay
A	that's just for putting the wire on isn't it?
B	do you use the remote?
C	well the remote's just to put
B	see that would be handy if I could sit it out of the way for just
B	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	I love the sound that comes from that
C	yeah that is good innit yeah
B	mm
C	but that's the only that's the aerial innit?
B	mm
C	and er
C	but the this this'll play without this thing in it
B	what connect it so the same connector on the end of that one is it?
C	not that's what I'm that's just
B	I wish I knew what the speaker connectors were they do look like BT ones don't they?
C	that's the same them little press things you know where you can press that put the wire in and let it go
B	oh it's another one of those is it?
C	yeah
B	oh well then
C	and all you need is a couple of bits of wire
B	yeah you do really
C	well the well if you want this I'm talking about

B	cos that's handy cos I could make up the it it is a bit of a worry when you're finding the right number on a disk
C	yeah
B	to to play
A	mm
B	then start it you'd start the next one wouldn't you?
C	yeah
B	then stop it and start it
B	if you put them all in order
C	yeah
B	that would be good
A	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh we'd we'd bagged quite a lot of money for it when it was brand new
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well it it
A	but er we actually preferred the other one didn't we?
B	it looked
C	we did prefer the other one
B	did you? you preferred your one you had before?
A	a little bit
B	do you know isn't it often the way the older stuff was
C	yes yes
B	they're cutting corners to
A	yeah
B	you know they make it look swish but there may be is hardly anything inside
A	er
B	the speakers are very very light
A	mm
B	you look at them and you think they're oh
C	you think they're heavy yeah
B	that's chunky
C	no
B	oh that one is
A	that's
B	well it's the bass
A	the woofer
C	that's the subwoofer

unknown_female	yeah
C	we never used it properly but they enjoyed it didn't they used
A	they used
B	mm
C	they used to sing to it and do
A	so we had a mother's day
unknown_female	mm
A	and they decided we need a children's day for
C	so we need a children's day as well
B	yeah
A	used to be when they finished school
B	yeah

B	the the the other the other lovely thing about that is you plug a mic in off you go
C	yeah you can plug a mic in and sing away
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well that see that's what I started off doing
C	yeah
B	to so it was a totally different service so
C	yeah
B	that we could it was something different for them
C	I rigged that up right
B	mm
A	mm
C	to play in every room in the house bar the kitchen
B	mm
C	there's wires go underneath the coving
B	mm
C	all round the house
B	yeah
C	and out into the dairy
B	mm
C	so we could have the
B	so it go to the dairy as well?
C	that go to the dairy as well
A	mm
C	and we got great big speakers in the dairy
A	got speakers in the dairy haven't we?
B	mm
C	yeah
B	mm
A	but we disconnected it
C	we did
B	mm
C	I can connect it up again
A	mm
C	that's no problem connect up again
A	yeah I suppose not no
B	did you label all the wires so you know where they go?
A	it goes out out the window
B	mm
A	mm
C	you sure you don't get that chest seen to?
B	no I just I just what I should've taken this morning is some Covonia
C	oh you buy that do you?
B	oh it just seems to
C	honey and lemon that's all you need
B	er that weren't working
C	yeah
B	she's lovely
C	yeah
B	isn't she lovely?
A	mm
B	oh and but she was in an interview with someone
C	oh yeah in that interview room?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and that Covonia loosens it
A	right
C	mm
B	and then whatever is still stuck there causes it
C	I don't understand how that work
A	mm
C	cos you swallow that you that don't go
B	yeah
C	down your that don't go down your windpipe that go down your
B	it it may be something to do with the vapours it gives off
C	it must be the vapours
A	yeah
B	and
C	this is why when we were kids
B	mm
C	mum used to put Vick
B	yeah
C	in the
B	hot water
C	in the pot of hot water and you used to sit over the top and
B	damp towel over your head
C	and breathe didn't you?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I reckon that worked just as well as anything else
B	it wasn't it wasn't unpleasant really was it? but it and it
C	it made your eyes water though
A	used to
A	do it with er leaves as well didn't we?
B	with what?
A	erm
C	yeah with er eucalyptus leaves
A	mm
B	you wouldn't have had them
C	eucalyptus
A	or no we didn't did we? was it lemon balm or something we put in?
C	oh lemon balm yeah you can do that as well
B	erm
A	something
B	what what is very good for colds
C	yeah
B	purple sage so that would give off a good scent
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and maybe it was something like erm
C	maybe it was like that yeah
B	spearmint?
A	yeah
C	yes
A	mm
B	er
A	I suppose anything that is sort of
B	sage would sage is good
A	clears

B	well rosemary native you can't I don't don't think anyone grows tea tree oil
B	tea trees here though that's Australia ain't it?
C	yeah
A	no
B	they probably found that out by all the prisoners going out
C	yeah
B	didn't they?
A	mm
C	well they had to didn't they? I mean they
B	well they had to find out things like that themselves didn't they? they just got dumped off
C	but the poor people they had to row all that way as well and
B	no they didn't
B	I know they didn't
C	well they they they were chained on the row

A	yeah
B	and it never come back did it?
A	you you
B	it never did
A	it didn't
B	it it well it well no it got to the got to the centre of the moat where the
A	yeah
B	house was
A	mm
B	and then in the bank there and then it never was
C	mm
B	gonna blow back unfortunately
C	well at
B	mm mm?
C	to put their boats the the boats in
B	mm
C	and I had a a boat that we'd made my dad had helped me
B	mm
C	and we'd made this out of balsa wood and what have you
B	mm
C	and I'd put on the side of it The Wrecker
B	mm
C	and that's what I called it
B	The Wrecker?
C	The Wrecker cos that had a big six-inch nail on the front
B	oh no and you went charging off into
B	yeah
C	and sailed it
B	is that where the university is now?
C	no that was
B	oh yeah yeah been round there once
A	mm
B	yeah
C	I think they they had to health and safety took you know the boating lake at
B	mm
C	you could stand on it and launch it stand near the water and launch er boats
B	mm mm
C	but kids used to jump on the top you see
B	mm
C	and inevitably fall in
A	it wasn't very deep though was it?
C	deep enough to
A	well obviously yeah
C	I mean er you can drown in a couple of inches of water
A	mm
B	but you've gotta learn you don't go into rivers and things like that
C	well of course you do yeah
A	yeah
B	what's the difference between they don't don't fill all the rivers in do they?
C	mind you we had a parkie then
A	it's it's silly isn't it?

B	mm
C	patrol round
B	mm
C	but as soon as I mean they stopped paying
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	and they all they become
B	mm
C	obsolete
B	mm
C	extinct or whatever you like to call it
B	mm
C	and er they never had parkies anymore so
B	mm
C	and spoilt the lot
B	well we did what we wanted if the parkie was er we'd wait till he got up the other end then we'd get our
A	right
B	we made all these erm
C	that's right yeah we did
