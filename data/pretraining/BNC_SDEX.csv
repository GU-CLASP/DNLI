A	okay hi good morning
B	hi
A	thank you for talking to me today
B	that's alright oh alright
A	erm and you did mention a subject that you might tell me about?
B	yes I'm gonna tell you about the eighth of January nineteen fifty-nine in
A	right
B	now you
A	yeah
B	this was for young men so many people had come out of the armed forces that they were getting short after a while
A	yeah yeah
B	and once you got to eighteen you were conscripted into either one of the forces or if you were very unlucky into the coalmines
A	right
B	to do two years' service there
A	right
B	sent me a railway warrant so I got on the train at home caught the train to
A	oh right
B	and I hadn't seen it with its new name plates on
A	yeah
B	until that day so I can say I saw that on the eighth of January nineteen fifty-nine
A	yeah
B	anyhow us guys began to recognise one another that we were all in the same boat so we started to make our way through
B	and er in the in the British army er the senior NCOs wear a red
A	oh I see
B	and because the NCOs took over on that day it was decreed that those guys should then wear their sash on the same side as the officers
A	right
B	again just going off tangent very slightly
A	yeah
B	erm there was a big coloured picture of a senior NCO from every infantry regiment in the British army
A	yeah
B	taken outside of Buckingham Palace they'd gone to meet the king
A	right
B	and the picture wasn't very clear but all these chaps lined up had their sash over the right shoulder but there was one there and you couldn't see his face over his left shoulder so
A	yeah
B	you know he was a
A	oh right yeah
B	anyhow we walked up through
A	yeah
B	and there was the barracks
A	keep going yeah
B	erm formidable go in
A	right
B	in the regiment and we were directed to barrack rooms big Victorian red brick barrack rooms cold they were heated by one open fire at each end and you were given a small amount of coke which was meant to last you for the week but in reality you could burn it in a day
A	right
B	and we went in we were given some bedding and not proper uniform to start with but denims which was enough to carry on with
A	yeah
B	had a cross eye
A	oh dear
B	so
A	not good for firing then
B	he he
B	he was alright actually
A	yeah
B	perhaps he closed his bad eye
A	yeah
B	but er
A	mm
B	and all the way through and this thing was issued
A	oh right
B	and then it came to greatcoats and you were told to put on a greatcoat and er he said when I look at you don't look down because if you look forward your coat will droop in the front
A	oh right yeah
B	so of course he got to me and the first thing I did was look down
A	yeah
B	so he said to me don't look down there's bugger all there
B	that was his expression but erm again towards that end of the first week the army being very crafty they decide you should have all your injections on a Friday because some of them were very painful
A	yeah
B	and they wanted to give you the Saturday and Sunday in your own time to get over them
A	gosh
B	so one of them was er what they called a TAB injection
A	yeah
B	you probably know this
A	erm well
B	it's a mixture of er typhus
A	everything
B	or
A	mm
B	and it's extremely painful
A	yeah
B	and I remember a big red mark coming up on my arm and it was a very sharp boundary to this red mark and ordinary
A	yeah
B	flesh if you touched the red oh
A	mm
B	but you'd go
A	yeah yeah
B	anyhow we were all taken off to what was
A	oh right
B	and er because that's where the medical officer was
A	right
B	and given all these injections in fact the medical officer was a retired colonel from the Royal Army Medical Corps
A	oh right
B	cos I don't think they had enough
A	right
B	proper chaps
A	yeah
B	and er he sitting there in his woolly cardigan
A	mm
B	and you know he's oh you know sort of thing
A	yeah
B	but er quite interesting anyhow also given to us that day was the smallpox
A	right
B	you know it was a sort of
A	yeah
B	scratchy thing
A	yeah
B	which brings you up in a
A	yeah
B	in a sore
A	yeah
B	and erm we had that my injection were alright but the smallpox thing didn't so
A	right
B	on my own I had to make me way instead of being taken by army lorry taken back to
A	right
B	er you know I walked
A	yeah oh right
B	and erm the extraordinary thing
A	mm
B	in
A	yeah
B	well er I went through
A	oh right
B	and I didn't wanna get back too quickly
A	yeah
B	so I sat down in the pavilion there in the seats outside
A	yeah
B	so that was nineteen fifty-nine never ever for a second dreaming
A	right
B	that I might come back there one day
A	no no
B	to run a railway
A	no
B	but anyhow
A	right
B	they'd give you an hour to get sorted out and half past six you would go for breakfast get marched to the cookhouse in those days too the boots they issued you with had hobnails so as you marched you made a tremendous crashing noise through
A	yes
B	erm and to get you up from bed of course they blew reveille on bugle
A	yes
B	and I often used to think about the people who lived in ordinary houses in
A	yeah
B	because their life must have been regimented really by by the army totally
A	yes absolutely
B	erm the assault course in those days was in
A	oh right
B	and er as you go past our track at
A	yes
B	there's a little building on the right which was the indoor rifle range
A	yes
B	go on again and you're there
A	there's a rifle
B	but of
A	range down there isn't there?
B	there was a full bore rifle range
B	oh it's
A	it's still we we frequently walk that way
B	mm I've not been down there
A	we come yeah the it's
B	so
A	well it was still there last time I went so
B	yeah yeah
A	sorry to stop you
B	no that's okay but you know er talking about the crashing of hobnails I used to think about those poor people in
A	right
B	we'd all go crashing down through
A	er weren't they very slippery on the tarmac as well?
B	no
A	they didn't slide?
B	no no no they you er got no sympathy for that you just dug your heels in
A	oh right
B	in fact I dug my heels in so hard I bruised my heel
A	oh dear
B	and I made my way back to the it was sometime
A	mm
B	afterwards to see the that same retired doctor
A	right
B	at
A	right
B	and er he just said oh excused boots for two or three days
A	oh right
B	so you couldn't take part in drill practice
A	oh right
B	or anything like that
A	uhu
B	supposedly
A	yeah mm
B	and one of the things you had to do was to heave on a parallel bar and I just couldn't do it and I couldn't
A	no
B	climb a rope
A	no no
B	so they decided that I should go off to
A	right
B	on a on a PT development course
A	oh lord yeah
B	and it was fun it was er a most odd lot of people there that you ever met
B	I discount myself from that but I must say it was the most
B	wonderful
A	excuse me
B	course
A	yes
B	because at the end of four weeks
A	mm
B	I I could climb a rope like a bloody monkey
A	really?
B	and I could
A	gosh
B	oh yes it was it was hard you started off the day with the running a mile
A	oh
B	and then er you would do what they called corrective PT
A	right
B	now in the erm gymnasium there were the wall bars
A	yeah
B	and you would strap your ankles under the bars
A	right
B	and heave up on that and
A	right
B	down with your hands and weightlifting it was pretty hard work and then later in the day you'd run a marathon do a short marathon three miles or so
A	yeah yeah
B	and er then perhaps play a game of hockey or something so it was er
A	right
B	but on top of this the army decided that you had to be fed up
A	right
B	I I don't like milk so you got a pint of
A	no
B	milk a day which I always managed to get rid of
A	yeah
B	and do you remember Virol?
A	er
B	the orange signs on railway stations now Virol anaemic girls need it
A	oh
B	Virol er growing boys need it well my mother used to buy that during the war
A	right
B	and because there
A	I don't
B	with
A	I don't remember
B	you're not old enough
A	well no no no I am I am I am because actually my father was stationed in
B	oh was he?
A	in in nineteen in nineteen fifty-nine
B	mm
A	in
B	wow
A	in
B	what was he in?
A	erm the Royal Engineers
B	well that's funny because a lot of us
A	right
B	but the
A	yeah
B	were due to merge in October of nineteen fifty-nine in
A	really?
B	yes so
A	gosh
B	I left the regiment before then
A	yes
B	because they sent me off elsewhere
A	right well I
B	do you want me to keep going?
A	pardon yeah oh hang on a minute
B	okay keep going
A	erm mm well just to say my father was the chaplain at
B	oh well I'm blessed
A	and he didn't have a he didn't have a church I mean he had to take his services in the NAAFI
B	yeah
A	which was quite interesting
B	yes
A	and erm but what they did was the Royal Engineers bought er built him a church
B	oh how wonderful
A	they built him a church and and it was
B	mm
A	er and it was wonderful it but it was in an old a Nissen hut
B	yeah
A	you know the black erm corrugated er iron
B	yeah
A	type huts and erm and then erm he he when we left when daddy left
B	oh
A	which was terribly sad
B	yeah isn't it just?
A	erm and I went back just before they erm left the barracks about erm oh dear was it five years ago? and erm and and saw where the church had been and I took
B	oh very nice
A	it was it was great
B	yeah
A	but anyway
B	yeah okay well
B	everything is interesting yes
A	mm
B	was
A	oh yeah?
B	er they decided then that I should go in and don't go laughing into the Intelligence Corps
A	oh right
B	because the Cyprus emergency was still on
A	right
B	and the Intelligence Corps never took national servicemen directly from
A	right
B	whatever school or whatever it was but they picked the ones they wanted from other regiments
A	right
B	supposed to be intelligent but that was wrong anyhow I got selected to go off so I left
A	yeah
B	because on that day the regimental band had come down from
A	yeah
B	and they were practising you know first of all marching up and down on the square wonderful sight and the sound
A	yeah
B	of the band and the bugles was really wonderful so I was sorry to go
A	yeah
B	but anyhow I got the train to er
A	mm
B	because we're all wearing different regimental badges
A	mm
B	from all over the place and we started then what would turned out to be about six months of so training and I was earmarked to go to Cyprus
A	mm
B	but then fortunately before I went the Cyprus emergency was over
A	right
B	so I never got there so er the towards the end of nineteen fifty-nine they were wondering what to do with all these people
A	uhu
B	that they trained up
A	yeah yeah
B	so they started a new strategic reserve in the army which was a series of brigades that were on short notice call in case there was emergency anywhere
A	oh right
B	so when I finished my training they said where do you want to go? so I thought my only chance to travel is either Hong Kong or Singapore I'll I'll go there
A	yeah
B	so I end up in
B	so
A	mm
B	and er we drove down to
A	right
B	go home on the train and
A	yeah
B	that was quite nice but we did a couple of interesting exercises from there and then towards the end of nineteen sixty
A	uhu
B	they decided they didn't want us anymore so then they had to find another home for us
A	right
B	erm and then I er got sent to
A	oh
B	I had about
A	that was a bit better
B	mm it was nice
A	yeah
B	er we the the the er it was headquarters
A	oh right
B	at
A	oh right right
B	because from where we were just walk up the road you could see the
A	yeah yeah
B	and that was very nice so from there erm
A	right
B	of the IRA
A	right
B	they would do a
A	right
B	so erm I mean the one notable trip that I did we we drove from
A	right
B	went up through
A	right
B	and all the way up north to
A	right
B	so I did actually get to see
A	oh did you?
B	and that
A	oh right oh right
B	er
A	so what are we doing here? er just just another couple of minutes er
B	oh right so erm there we are anyhow
A	well erm what did you think going back to
B	yes
A	what did you think about
B	yes
A	was so badly bombed wasn't it?
B	yes a lot of it had actually been finished by then
A	yeah
B	but of course some of those buildings they put up then they've pulled down again
A	right
B	but one of the places we used to frequent there was the NAAFI club
A	right
B	which we'd go in there
A	yeah
B	and I met a a chief petty officer off an Indian frigate it was an brand new Whitby class frigate
A	right
B	which the Indians had come over to pick up from the builders in this country
A	yeah
B	and they got as far as the English Channel and it broke down
A	right
B	so it came in to er
A	right yeah
B	and er got talking to this guy he was very nice and he said oh come on board for lunch
A	yeah
B	so erm I thought I don't know about navy you know
A	mm
B	you you hear about saluting the quarterdeck and all that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	and I wasn't familiar so I went in civvies
A	right
B	and was met by this guy and er had lunch with him and it was curry
A	right yeah
B	surprise surprise
A	they would always have curry
B	yeah
A	they did in the Royal Engineers every Sunday
A	every Sunday
A	yeah
B	every day but on Sundays they have chicken curry
A	oh
B	so that was a treat and er the the the the sweet was an apple
A	oh right oh
B	so that was
A	ah interesting
B	that was interesting
A	yes
B	so I saw this this brand new
A	mm
B	frigate
A	yeah
B	which was being repaired and never of course heard from the guy again
A	no
B	but there we are
A	no isn't it interesting?
B	yeah
A	these encounters? and I I was looking back last night on groups of people I've known through the years
B	mm
A	because I moved about quite a lot and I don't see them now or I don't hear from them and you think it's a shame really
B	yeah
A	but then you move on in life
B	yeah
A	you can't hang on to every experience
B	yeah
A	can you? not really so we've done it
B	well done
A	so I'll just erm
B	I hope it's
