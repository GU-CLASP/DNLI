A	some of the things that we're gonna have recorded
B	well
A	it's really
B	Don't worry about it
A	well I do a little
B	well don't
A	mm
B	I
A	tut
B	working my master plan
A	tut
B	to leave the country
A	you've been a bit extravagant
A	um um with er your money
B	well yes
A	yes
B	mother's Day
A	I know
B	er weddings
A	oh I know
B	I don't really have a choice
A	no  no I know  I know
B	so
A	I know
B	yes
A	not having any money
B	it's
A	I don't like it at all
B	very very annoying
A	it is
B	which one do you want the daffies in?
A	um
B	er nope
B	I think I got that tax rebate because from it was from working in Waterstones
A	oh that's right
B	so I got
A	they always take at least two years to
B	yeah
A	catch up with you
B	and they'd um well it was September last year
A	okay
B	so it
B	um
A	it took them about two years to give me my tax back
B	some of er some of it is
A	yeah
B	um on this date
A	yeah
B	and they can sort it out more quickly
A	yeah
B	till they get to you then
A	yeah
B	no it does take a long time
A	I suppose that's it
B	so that was quite nice
A	I'd forgotten all about it so it was a nice um
B	and I wasn't expecting it
A	bonus
B	I just assumed that the tax was correct
A	yeah
B	which obviously was foolish
A	mm
B	so it could be that I earn this money now and maybe I see some of it later on or I don't
A	mm
B	you just have to pay tax and national insurance and all the rest of it
A	I know
B	so it just seems like er you know you
A	well you you don't get half the money
B	six four eight nine
A	oh no  no I don't  I don't know what the numbers mean but you know it's just
B	well you can earn up to
A	no no no
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	twenty-three grand so
A	yeah
B	so you pay twenty per cent tax
A	yeah
B	but you also pay national insurance on top of that
A	yeah
B	and student loans
A	yeah
B	well out of my salary I've got my
A	it just feels like it
B	I've got yeah I've got tax
A	yeah
B	so I've got the my contributions to my pension and and the
A	yeah
B	so yeah it's a bit um
A	no
B	er they'd calculated it incorrectly
A	mm
B	tut
A	fair enough
B	until it gets to the point when people just refuse
A	mm
B	originally it was supposed to be the end of March
A	mm
B	Cos they found they had more money to pay people
A	well it gives the transcribers a laugh doesn't it
B	yeah
A	oh really
B	I did sort of I just warned him and said if you get any of mine it's basically just me talking about boys the whole time so
A	or
B	and booze
A	or racist jokes
B	or racist jokes
B	please don't judge
B	please don't judge
B	they know me well enough though fortunately
A	true
B	I'd only be embarrassed if it were
A	mm
B	so yeah
A	Good
B	just
A	okay
B	Cos I'd worked out that I could only save two hundred pounds a month
A	oh my God
B	or four hundred and seventy-eight
A	oh that's really good
B	so to round it up to five hundred I'll just have to use the car less
A	yeah
B	petrol
A	yeah
B	then that should be fine
A	yeah
B	and
A	I mean you don't need to use it as much
B	I don't need to
A	so you should be cycling more
B	er yeah I I am
A	no
B	I'm gonna put it away so it's out of temptation
A	absolutely
B	plus I worked out that my route to work is three and a half miles
A	right
B	so every day I cycle seven miles
A	that's very good
B	so per week that's thirty-five miles
A	well that's really good
B	so that's really good
A	that's very good exercise for you
B	it's really really good
A	it is
B	so yeah
A	it is
B	so I need to do that more really
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	if I'm going out somewhere or if I've thought oh I'll come round here for lunch
A	yeah exactly
B	or whatever
A	yeah
B	I'll just
A	that's different isn't it
B	try and not do that really
A	mhm
B	and she's booked her tickets to Australia
A	really?
B	yeah
A	so she's definitely going?
B	she's definitely going
A	right
B	it's really cheeky actually the way they've done it
A	mm
B	so she got all of the summer off last year
A	oh right
B	and then she'll come back and only do half a term
A	yeah
B	and then have it off again
A	mm
B	so it's pretty pretty unfair on her
A	mhm
B	um
A	yes
B	so
A	that's where
B	oh is it?
A	um
B	oh okay
A	I told you
B	um
A	uh
B	um
A	er

B	yeah
A	stuff before I hoovered
B	hmm
A	anyway
B	did you have a conversation with Imogen in the end? Or have you
A	about?
B	just avoided it? About chores in the home
A	um
A	I mean I haven't sort of said look
B	yeah
A	I've just said you know can you just do this or just do that
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	but I dunno
B	A touch
A	and it does get a bit annoying but huh
B	well I think that's it
A	well she had yesterday off
B	exactly
A	and I asked her to do it and she didn't
B	mm
A	I didn't realize until the evening and I was really tired so
B	mm
A	no and I don't wanna have arguments
B	no
A	I mean I just want her to think of it and do it
B	yeah
A	which you did
B	no
A	what you're supposed to do
B	yeah
A	but it's like she still is in a way so
B	well it's like she thinks that cos she's moved home different rules apply
A	huh
A	yes
B	I might have one actually
A	that's the one
B	it's at the back I think
A	er cos that's that's smaller I think

C	you won't know what's going on
C	anyway
C	nobody knows what's really going on
B	they don't answer questions
A	okay

A	no
B	mm
A	right
B	Cos he's you know he's er he he's should be able to look after himself
A	yeah
B	so yes
A	I expect he just thinks you know er er er he's done everything er and but I don't the thing is
A	your grown-up children then you know um will do things like that for you
B	mm
A	but not if you've been
B	if you've mistreated them and haven't earnt their
A	abusive and er you know
B	well er
A	er a really crap father
B	well particularly because you know it's really highlighted with
A	yeah
B	that she and her dad don't have a great relationship and it's really difficult with him in the house cos he hates kids and obviously there's three of them living there
A	God just she should just tell them to go

A	I know
B	tut
A	no
B	and why should she feel
A	no
B	I don't know er um what
A	and you so you know er he might expect his grown-up children to look after him but they're not going to want to do it
B	no
A	I think
A	yeah
B	and you think she's got a family of her own
A	it does
B	her and
A	I'm sure it does
B	so huh yeah it's just er I mean he's it's always gonna be a mess
A	terrible situation
B	as far as he's concerned
A	he's had cancer twice
B	he's had
A	huh
B	they've basically said their goodbyes to him twice
A	yeah
B	er the cancerous cells
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh dear
B	and of course there's no rule book on how you're supposed to feel
A	I mean her mum is a certain kind of character
B	yeah
A	that you're probably not gonna get anymore
B	mm
A	or a very old-fashioned kind of just very good person
B	she's a very good person
A	and a bit selfless
B	now stands up to him
A	she's
B	and you can't
A	it will never happen
B	and you can't be angry at her for doing that
A	no
B	for not  for not  doing it
