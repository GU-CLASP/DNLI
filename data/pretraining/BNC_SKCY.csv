A	so you can work in London? And he can find a job in London can he?
B	yeah
A	what shall we do? What shall we do?
B	yeah
A	it's a difficult one though isn't it?
B	I know
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	I mean I
B	I think if it had been ten years ago we would have both said yeah let's do it
A	how I mean how far out of London can you live so that it's not actually really London living?
B	erm it depends like basically the BBC will give me a relocation package
A	oh yeah
B	so they'd help me sell my house and help finance a move
A	oh right
B	so I could say no I don't want any financial help
A	mm
B	and then I thought well I could commute it from
A	would you miss
B	erm well all my friends are here
A	how far is Hereford from
B	from London?
A	London?
B	be over three hours
A	oh gosh really?
B	between three and four hours I think
A	is it that far?
B	mm
A	oh I guess cos London's more east to the east isn't it
B	mm
A	do you like it?
B	mm
A	it might need a bit of salt and a bit of pepper
B	oh it's really yummy
A	ooh er
B	I can taste carrot
A	yep carrot parsnip potatoes sweet potatoes celery onion
B	mm
A	I think that's it
B	I need to start making soup more
A	but it's so easy
B	oh wow and that's it?
A	yeah
B	God
A	mm
B	Cos I need to start being more healthy
A	really?
B	well me and
A	oh
B	and we were just like right we're not gonna worry about food or anything cos we're both prone to like putting on weight and stuff
A	ah it's holiday though
B	yeah
A	ah well you're still going through that honeymoon period aren't you
B	oh I've never done that
A	no?
B	no
A	so how long was it since you dated and started to realise that you actually?
B	it all happened really fast actually
A	mm
B	I'd say within three weeks we were like we were kind of talked about not moving in straight away but we were kind of like yeah
A	oh wow
B	we can see this going somewhere
A	ah
B	mm
A	and has he met the Boodhoos?
B	mm
A	oh
B	yeah
A	do your parents love him?
B	mm they do
A	ah
B	so yeah I remember at the time everyone was going oh this is going too fast
A	yep
B	there's no point
A	yeah yeah yep
B	saying oh no let's not do this cos you know it's too fast
A	well there's no little rule book is there? It's
B	no
A	as you say how things go naturally and
B	mm
A	important to go with the flow
B	yeah
A	and where's he from?
B	erm he's from the
A	ha
B	yeah so we had a really nice like few days down there when we went to see his parents
A	oh that's a beautiful place
B	erm
A	yep
B	it's like a little village
A	mm mm
B	like you could probably walk to the  to the  actual inter-forest from there
A	is that quite close to
B	it's closer to
A	okay
B	yeah
A	yeah my dad's got a little  a little  boat down near well it's basically just opposite the Isle of White
B	oh okay that's probably close then
A	so he's he sees the
B	mm
A	when my aunt she used to erm her husband was a farmer so she used to breed horses on the farm
B	oh wow
A	and they used to take their horses down to the
B	ah
A	to gallop around on holiday
B	so how are you finding it being back in England?
A	mm
B	do you miss Spain?
A	I miss the weather
B	mm
A	I miss the passion
B	yeah
A	but there's a lot of things that England has that Spain doesn't
B	yeah
A	definitely
B	all the time
A	it is really nice
B	yeah
A	yeah I'm trying to get in a little visit
B	mm
A	just to feel the sun like this for example this morning if it was like this every day
B	how how did you find the winter then that must have been tough
A	well it
B	mm
A	when I got into December I was thinking I can handle this
B	mm
B	are you still speaking Spanish much then? Or have you not spoken any for a while?
A	no actually I've not
B	oh yeah
A	so I was still kind of thinking about it but I mean teaching Spanish at secondary school
B	yeah
A	there's not much teaching or Spanish involved
B	oh God
A	come on sit down
B	oh my God
A	sit down
A	um
B	mm
A	but the thing is once you've engaged the kids that you know are open to it
B	yeah
A	you've got all the ones that are playing up and have got anger management issues or
B	God
A	visual impairment
B	that sounds really tough
A	it is tough because you're dealing with so many variables in the one class
B	mm
A	that er as soon as you've engaged one of the groups you lose all the others
B	yeah
A	so it was only really a handful of naughty boys that used to distract the class
B	yeah
A	but in the schools that I've seen and the schools that you know my colleagues were telling me it's it's not it's now it's only a handful of kids that you can actually work you know teach
B	oh God
A	and it's the rest it's all crowd control and
B	do you think you'll go back to it?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I mean having done the training in inner city
B	yeah
A	I'm sure that there are schools that that you don't have to handle that amount of misbehaviour and
B	yeah
A	and cos I'm
B	oh okay
A	that's why a lot of the jobs are coming up are in Oxford
B	mm
A	I think if you're targeting publishing it's Oxford Cambridge or London really
B	mm
A	erm
B	okay
A	but that was I think quite normal because I phoned the guy in Human Resources and asked him about this particular job that I couldn't work out whether it was in Oxford or Madrid
A	but I kind of took that opportunity to just quickly tell him my experience and ask him a bit of advice
B	yeah
A	and he was like look you know just because it says we require sales and marketing experience
B	mm
A	if there's one or two things on the requirements list that you don't have send your CV in anyway because
B	okay
A	you never know
B	yeah
A	I didn't  I didn't  think that I think I might have got an interview had they only had like three people
B	yeah
A	ha ha but I don't think in this day and age they only get three people
B	no that's true
A	applying
B	mm
A	yep
B	do you?
A	mm mm
B	oh
A	I did er teach in sixth form too because there were erm most schools nowadays have their own little sixth form
B	yeah
A	and it was generally nicer because they were smaller classes
B	and they wanna be there don't they I guess?
A	they still don't wanna be there
B	oh don't they?
A	no no no no
B	oh
A	they still didn't wanna be there
B	God
A	mm
B	you know it's a kind of a choice isn't it? Cos you don't have to go
A	yeah
B	want to learn
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's such a shame
B	yeah
A	and of course I'm going into it off fourteen years teaching
B	yeah
A	effectively not because I'm an effective teacher but because the
B	yeah yeah
A	these kids were at least motivated to be there
B	okay
A	because if you're energetic and enthusiastic
B	mm
A	and you know you make them laugh and you get them to do the work
B	yeah
A	and you get them to see that they can actually do it
B	yeah
A	but if you go into a secondary school class of thirty kids who don't want to be there
B	yeah
A	why learning languages would be important
A	and you know make fun of the teacher
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you've just started off completely on the wrong foot with them
B	God
A	well you just have to be really disciplinarian and serious
B	mm
A	gage the class and maybe ease off on the whole seriousness
B	mm
A	oh it's just such a shame
B	hmm
A	it really is
B	yeah
A	no I'd only have to take it up from January
B	oh that's good
A	the stuff I've already done counts
B	yeah
A	but I think it was a bad time for me to do it really cos I I'd just I pretty much had a year of full on intense work
B	yeah yeah
A	without without holidays and went straight from you know full on intense work in Spain to the day that I finished my job I moved back to England
B	oh my God
A	I know so I think maybe with a bit more
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	England has changed so much since I left
B	is it? God mm
A	but you'll probably get that if you move to London as well
B	yeah
A	it's like a different country
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and I'm working longer hours
A	mm
B	yeah they would
A	it doesn't reflect the
B	it doesn't cover kind of you know tube fares and
A	yeah
B	and all that
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it is crazy
B	mm
A	and when you're paying the rent and pay like paying bills and stuff it's not significantly
B	yeah
A	cheaper in the areas that they wanna pay people minimum wages
B	yeah yeah I know
A	mm
B	I'm alright thanks actually
A	there's loads left
B	erm the other option is Salford though cos you know loads of Fiat jobs are moving up there
A	ah
B	so I can look into erm redeployment and and see if there's any work in Salford
A	yeah?
B	it's a bit more like
A	what kind of things is he looking for?
B	erm just charity work still
A	what was his PhD in?
B	history
A	what particular part?
B	erm
B	it was something to do with the working class sailors of Southampton in the early nineteen hundreds
A	oh wow
B	that was
A	so in the
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and he got that on the basis of erm he well actually he started off as a an advisor
A	mm
B	and then he's kind of worked himself up from there really
A	oh super
B	yeah
A	yeah I've heard of quite a few people who have erm got their careers out of temp jobs
B	mm
A	well is that something that he he went into quite early though? The temp job early in his career?
B	erm well he's er no only about three years ago
A	okay
B	yeah so he would have been late twenties
A	mm
B	mm I guess so
A	you've got options
B	yeah
A	really? Not even with two salaries?
B	yeah maybe
A	yep
B	like I own a four bedroom house in
A	is that  is that  the one in Bearwood?
B	mm
A	oh okay the one that you rent out?
B	yeah it's me and two other guys
A	uh-huh
B	who yeah rent rooms
A	so are you thinking of moving in together in interim
B	mm
A	oh
B	well I'd like to get married next year if I'm honest
A	really?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Cos I just think I don't wanna leave it too much later
A	ah
B	which I've told him that so he knows that it has to be soon
A	have you heard heard
B	no
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	she's getting married at Christmas
B	that's really soon
A	erm I think when they went to India
B	mm
A	they were talking about having kids and and I think he
B	mm
A	erm up
B	okay
A	yeah
B	mm
A	of just party cos it's over Christmas as well
B	yeah
A	just getting his family cos he's French
B	that's right yeah
A	so they have to come from France
B	ah
A	friends
B	I mean er they're not is there not not gong to be like a Sikh wedding or anything?
A	there's going to be erm a registry civil wedding
B	mm
A	for the legal aspects
B	yeah
A	and then they're gonna have a Sikh er ceremony as well so
B	ah
A	for that day he will be
B	wow
A	ah and the dress she showed me was amazing
B	mm
A	so
B	indian style?
A	yeah
B	wow
A	over her shoulders
B	and she's got like the right height and the right figure to carry off stuff like that
A	she's gorgeous isn't she?
B	mm
A	yeah so but I'm not sure if she's wanting to spend that much money on a dress that you'll wear for one day
B	yeah yep one day
B	yeah
A	are you sure you don't want some more soup? There's loads left
B	no I'm alright
A	mm go for it
B	Cos it's really yummy that bread
A	it is
B	is it the same one? Oh is it?
A	well she's marrying
B	oh God yeah
A	the guy who owns that bakery
B	of course
A	the little French café and
B	oh my God
A	so this is his bread
A	funnily enough
B	the last time I saw
A	oh right
B	and it was two days before my date with
B	Cos I was like oh yeah I've got this internet date
A	how things happen
A	and was he did you meet him quite soon after you'd erm signed up to the
B	mm
A	blimey
B	I know it was really bad
A	was he the first date that you had off it as well?
B	yeah first of anyone
A	oh
B	who were potentials as well
B	who you know were really nice and stuff
A	mm mm
B	but erm yeah so he was the first one
A	and did you put your photo up on the site then?
B	mm
A	were you not worried that people in the office would see you or?
B	no cos I think people knew anyway that I was dating and internet dating and stuff
A	oh right
B	so yeah it all happened really quickly
A	and how long had he been on there previously to?
B	he'd probably been on there a couple of months
A	mm
B	I think he had a date with one other girl as well
A	mm mm
B	Cos I think it's the other way round for women
B	whereas girls like to play it cool
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	did he get in touch with you or?
B	mm
A	oh no
B	which I didn't know anyway
B	so I guess I kind of instigated it
A	mm
B	hello
A	hello
D	hello
A	do you know
D	er I don't think we've met have we?
B	I don't think we've we've met? No
A	no? Well Dan's another internet dating success
B	oh okay
A	do you want some soup Dan?
D	er yeah I wouldn't say no
A	help yourself
B	and then there's
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's not easy living in a situation where you don't know where you're gonna be
B	yeah
A	mm
B	like there's they're not moving anywhere I don't think are they?
A	so what division are you with?
B	well I'm Asian at work but news
A	mm
B	so news side and programme side they're two different
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so yeah I don't
A	yep
B	I I think she'll be fine on the job
A	but isn't there talk about completely getting rid of the
B	no I don't
A	no?
B	they're getting rid of the Leicester side of things
A	oh okay
B	yeah but
A	can you not work from
B	no
A	mm
B	yeah
A	couldn't you work out some kind of thing whereby you stay in
B	possibly
A	uh-huh
B	so if he does that for me he'll have to do it for everyone and he's not gonna do that
A	oh what a shame
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yep
B	it's a lot harder for them
A	mm
B	but who knows
A	what kind of thing would you be looking for?
B	I don't know
A	oh yeah?
B	erm cos we were like well if I could take the redundancy and do that
A	mm
B	erm we like the idea of opening a restaurant but hope not not as a
A	really?
B	like we can't cook
B	we had talked about opening a Mauritian restaurant
A	mm
B	no one's gonna come to ours
A	is it in
B	well it'll just look like we're jumping on the bandwagon now
A	no
B	maybe
A	people will be up for Mauritian food now
A	what's it like? Mauritian food?
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	lovely lovely
B	A lot of fish
A	it is nice isn't it? How was your run then?
D	it was good
A	beautiful day for it
D	it's a bit chilly
A	you might have to warm it up
D	I'll give it a blast in the microwave
A	Good idea
B	and so we need to organise some drinks really don't we and have a night out
A	definitely
B	I haven't seen
A	that er German restaurant that you were telling her about sounded good
B	mm
A	oh is it Austrian
B	mm
A	that sounded really cool
B	it's brilliant
A	have you been there?
B	yeah
B	you go down into the basement and they've turned it into a bar and you're having drinks there
A	and does it look like a does it look like someone's house?
B	from the outside
A	oh
B	and like when you're inside it like it looks like a restaurant but you can kind of tell
A	mm
B	yeah definitely worth going
A	because I've I've heard of these places that erm people actually set up restaurants in their own homes
B	mm
A	but on a very small scale
B	I'm in someone's house
A	yeah
A	but it just sounds a bit a little bit weird
B	yeah once you're in there it does look like a restaurant
A	mm
B	so if they opened a restaurant like that on a residential street
A	what's the food like?
B	yeah really nice
A	but not not that memorable then
B	yeah it's kind of like meat and veg and stuff but you just get a set menu so you have to have three courses
A	mm mm
B	but erm yeah it's definitely I think it's just such a weird experience being in there
A	mm
B	where did Indi take not Indi where did
A	ah to a lovely little restaurant called
B	ah
A	I think they'd er he'd been in London for two days and
B	oh okay
A	she was knackered and and they just got home and said oh where do you wanna go out? And they were like oh shall we just get
B	ah
A	Sabai Sabai to deliver
B	ah
A	and just chilled at home
B	ah
A	which is lovely cos when you're er when you're knackered
B	yeah
A	and you've gotta go to work the next day and you're not really in the  in the  mood for it
B	no
A	mm
B	it must be nice having them so close
A	definitely but she's actually been ill for a bit
B	oh okay
A	she's erm did you know she had to have her wedding ring cut off?
B	no
A	I think erm I don't know whether it was an allergic reaction to the ring
B	mm
A	or whether she had a bit of eczema under it
B	oh yeah
A	he was able to cut it off
B	okay
A	and they were in India and it got better I think under the sun
B	oh okay
A	then when they came back it just flared up again to the extent where it got completely infected
B	oh God
A	got infected
B	she was feeling vomitty
D	has that happened since last weekend?
A	yeah
D	or was this before?
A	no
D	shit
A	I know
B	oh God
A	Cos she's er her little car is on her little drive
B	so they still don't know what caused it then?
A	no they don't know
B	yeah
A	I have no idea
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	but they've given her anti-inflammatories and antibiotics
B	oh okay
A	and steroids and
B	and she can't wear her ring at the moment
A	no
B	ah
A	they had all those jokes though when they had to cut it off
A	she doesn't wanna be my wifey any more
B	that must have been quite hard for them actually with the
A	I know
B	but I guess he can put it back together again somehow
A	oh yeah
B	oh with that
A	you get it enlarged or
B	yeah
A	I think it's easily done but it's more of the
B	yeah
A	so where do you want to get married? Have you  have you  actually started?
B	in in Hereford
A	oh right
B	this is the other thing though because my family are Catholic
A	really?
B	he doesn't want to
A	what is it you want about a Catholic church marriage?
B	just because I dunno it's more of childhood thing
A	oh
B	and it's a really lovely building and it's in a really
A	mm
B	he just doesn't really agree with Catholicism
A	really?
B	which is fair enough
A	yeah
B	rather than making him go through a ceremony that he just doesn't want to do
A	mm
B	but
A	that's weird cos I'm not religious but I wouldn't actually rule out getting married in a religious institution if it was gorgeous
B	yeah well I think it's cos cos it's the Catholic church
A	oh right
B	if it was Church of England I don't think he'd have as many issues
A	and he's okay with you being Catholic?
B	yeah yeah he's fine with that
A	are you  are you  practising?
B	yeah not so much any more
A	mm mm
B	and but when I was travelling I went quite a bit
A	mm
B	yeah it was
A	ah
B	but it's fine
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah definitely
B	erm but as long as it's in Hereford then I don't mind
D	can I have a soup now?
A	yeah go for it
D	no I've been doing stuff upstairs
A	you missed out on
D	oh
B	do they make it all there?
A	mm
D	no they make it in town somewhere
A	oh okay
B	oh
D	Cos they've got a bake the well a bakery I should think
A	mm
D	I don't know how to describe it
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	coffee and cake
B	yeah
A	and we had a
D	did you have a citron?
A	no we didn't cos we had lemon meringue pie yesterday so
B	mm
A	kind of citroned out
B	oh go on then
A	got to finish the  bit
B	thank you
A	and we had the apricot tart
D	that sounds
A	and the apple and blackberry tart
B	mm
A	ah
B	did your mum like it?
A	she loved it
B	ah yum
A	and it's got a lovely custard base to it
B	ah
A	the fruit's so tangy
A	they've got a place in
B	yeah
A	I think that might have been the original one
B	oh okay
A	mm
D	no the original one is already
A	oh is it?
D	and the
B	ah so
A	she is
B	oh my God
D	what's this rubbish?
A	I think they have both erm both him and his brother have all the different venues together
D	the

A	mm mm
B	mm
A	well she was on her was to work and just stopped in for a coffee but ended up getting snowed in at the café
B	hmm mm
A	and so she just decided to work from the caé on her laptop
B	wow
A	it's like would you like a coffee or a cake? Or would you like to marry me?
B	that's a proper romantic story
A	it is isn't it
D	wow

B	last week at work yeah

B	oh okay
A	and um
B	he lives in
A	yeah that's right
B	mm
A	that was the night we were  we were  deejaying in the  in the  lounge
D	hmm mm
B	oh my God
A	I know
A	I was like okay
B	that reminds me of the night we were at er Halloween though
A	where did we go out? We were back at
B	yeah yeah
D	we didn't see you that night cos me and
A	which night?
D	halloween
A	oh
B	oh we didn't go there
A	no no
B	oh no this was a couple of years
A	it was the year before wasn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	that was when we all got dressed up
B	and gatecrashed parties
A	we did
B	we we went to someone's party but I don't know who it was
A	we went to two different parties in
B	yeah
A	And then yeah we went to
B	I've just got this brilliant picture when
B	which she was drinking at one of the parties
A	do you remember that guy at the at
B	oh yeah
A	Cos everybody was like really animated and happy and drinking and dancing
A	we all cheekily got our photos taken with him didn't we?
B	that was a good night
A	it was
B	oh yeah
A	no maybe it wasn't three hours
B	we looked we all looked really good
A	I think we did
B	sexy witches
A	oh back in our youth
B	I know
A	it's crazy
B	mm
D	who do you class as everyone?
A	everyone
D	bet
B	she wants to
B	I think it's just an awkward situation isn't it
A	no there's definitely been some discourse there
B	oh okay
B	oh that's good
A	little things as well
B	mm
D	yeah see isn't there some parental thing going on
B	yeah yeah
A	do they not know that she's getting married with him?
B	no no
A	oh
B	so the families don't' know
B	yeah
D	mm
A	I knew he was Pakistani
B	mm
A	of Pakistani origin but I didn't
B	so yeah that's why it's I think there's a few issues with
A	oh dear
B	that's like I think she she wants all that but
A	yeah
B	she needs to tell her parents first really
A	but her parents are lovely aren't they? Wouldn't they?
D	yeah but they're quite old school
B	yeah they are
A	really? I suppose
B	they'd want her to marry a Sikh man
A	really?
B	definitely not a Muslim
A	ah
D	mm mm
B	no
A	I just don't agree with that kind of
B	no
D	but they'd let her marry an Englishman
B	yeah they'd be more accepting over that than a Muslim
A	well Faisal Faisal's a total Englishman really isn't he?
B	but he asked her once kind of in jest
D	God
B	so he obviously has kind of traditional values as well
A	really?
B	so as much as you know they want it to be easy I think both of them have kind of got these I dunno religious and cultural values that
A	what a shame
B	I know
A	it's all gonna go really like Romeo and Juliet on us
D	I hope they don't both die
B	hopefully not
A	no no hopefully not
B	Cos you know when they lived together? Her mum and dad knew that they were living together but she they just thought he was the housemaid
A	oh okay
B	they didn't know they were like boyfriend girlfriend
D	oh
A	ooh la la
B	yeah
A	blimey with
D	were they the only two in the house?
B	pardon?
D	were they the only two in the house?
B	yes
D	come on
B	but whenever they came round
B	I mean me I'm another friend of hers erm hers and we both said your parents aren't stupid
D	not some parents
B	I don't  I don't  think they're gonna be that surprised when you tell them
A	but they sound  they sound  like really lovely people as well
D	yeah her dad picked me up from the airport last year
A	ah
B	but he's he's got a he has the whole turban and the beard doesn't he?
D	who her dad?
B	yeah
D	erm
B	I think he does
D	I don't
B	and her brother does as well
A	mm
D	I don't vividly remember seeing him wearing a turban but I'm sure he did
B	yeah
A	are you eating peanut butter with that soup?
B	I know I was just thinking that
B	how can you spoil
D	I'm not putting it in the same spoon
A	actually I can see how it might complement the taste
D	peanut butter just goes with everything
A	oh it does not
D	cloying?
B	yeah it does doesn't it yeah
D	peano-philia
B	yeah maybe
D	A peano-philiac
D	peano
A	do you like the soup?
D	mm
A	nice and fresh
B	I'm gonna start making soup
A	it is so easy honestly
D	just lob it in and boil it and then blend it
B	yeah and I always think it's going to be really complicated but it's not really is it?
A	yep
D	was it onion butternut squash carrot garlic onion?
A	no garlic even
D	oh
A	potato sweet potato parsnip carrot celery and onion
B	mm
A	with a bit of black pepper
B	ha yeah
A	it's so nice and it's healthy
B	my mum does a really nice one which it probably isn't that healthy actually but it's blue cheese and potato
A	mm
B	it's so nice
D	broccoli Stilton
B	mm
A	mm
B	oh okay
A	but erm you should have a look at
D	that would not surprise me
D	she's got pretty much a library in there
A	well
D	I know it'd be rude not to
A	have you seen? Her room's just walled with shelving
B	oh really?
A	do you think? Originally her family lived in this house didn't they?
D	I dunno
B	oh okay
D	but I don't know if he lived here alone or had family or what
A	did he operate out of here? Like did he have a doctor's surgery here as well? Cos
D	there was loads of weird stuff
A	mm
D	there was like somebody
D	it was like it's alright
A	my parents are getting letters from these two guys
B	no way
A	and they got a letter just the other day from some debt collection company saying we're coming round to collect eight-five pounds worth of unpaid fees or something and
B	oh my God
A	well the took it they've already taken it all to the police
B	oh okay
A	and they've got a really friendly local police officer
B	yeah
A	community police officers actually you know interacting and
B	yeah
A	er in a nice way and helpful way
B	yeah
A	because most of it's happening on Ebay and online and
D	mm
B	mm
A	I guess it's difficult to track
B	yeah
A	but it's slightly disconcerting having debt collectors writing you letters saying
B	yeah
D	we used to get debt letters for ex-housemates
A	ha really?
A	do you actually phone them up and say look they don't live here any more or
D	well there's not much you can do
B	it's not always easy to do though like if you don't who lived here before
A	mm
D	I know a few of them
B	oh okay
D	there's was er
B	oh God
A	naughty naughty
B	well erm I used to live in  about ten years ago

D	what?
A	you're joking
B	ha it was yeah
D	if you change your driving licence's address
B	yeah
D	then it would automatically forward on
B	so she obviously hadn't done that but yeah through
D	I mean that's a crime in itself
B	yeah
A	is it?
D	you know you can get done like a grand if you don't change your driving licence address
A	that's a bit brutal isn't it
D	yeah but it's for the reason that people don't change addresses and then
B	oh my God
D	and then like transferring them from one name to another name to say that I wasn't driving such and such whereas er this address was
B	I mean that takes so much effort
A	yeah
D	it was some scam
B	oh okay
D	I don't know if he was offering a service where people can like sell their points to him and stuff
B	oh right
A	I'll buy your brains sucker
B	yeah
