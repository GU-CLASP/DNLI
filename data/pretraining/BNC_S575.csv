B	you know we told you about the bird collecting Abi fur in the garden last year?
A	uh-huh
B	and we filmed it
C	the
A	oh is that the thing on Dropbox?
C	yes
B	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
B	no you should
A	I've
C	mm
B	it's really quite funny
A	I've got a list of things I need to look at
B	mm
A	online
B	and looking back to last year when we took that film it looks as though I need to start putting the fur out pretty quickly
C	it was about this time
B	mm
A	huh
C	last year
A	have they started taking it to build nests?
B	well I haven't put any out yet
B	Cos this is obviously the beginning of the nesting season
C	no
B	out there
C	no
B	I haven't seen that many birds at all
A	does anyone want a cup of tea?
C	I'd like one now
B	mm
C	thank you
B	yes?
C	mm
B	I don't think so thank you
A	okay
C	mm
B	ralphy
B	mm
C	mm
B	that's over a weekend
C	mm
B	and the concourse was absolutely empty by eleven o'clock
C	what did they do? Close the court for the rest of the
B	no
C	day?
B	no
C	mm
B	but that's a sign of
C	yeah
B	how little work is coming through
C	mm
B	and it's all because the police aren't charging
C	yeah
B	giving them fixed penalties and things like that rather than taking them through the courts
C	well
B	it's ridiculous
C	or it could mean there's no crime
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	this morning
C	God
B	and there they were standing up there saying oh well he's doing this course and he might get a job at the end of it and blah blah blah
C	hmm
B	work commitment three times without
C	yeah
B	providing evidence
C	yeah
B	you know er he can only go on for
C	no
B	so long
C	trouble with oh that's good
B	yep
A	what did they send him to prison for?
B	he'd been given a suspended
C	thank you
B	sentence for whatever it was he did
A	and did he think he was going to get away with it?
B	I have a suspicion that he knew jolly well what they were
A	er huh
B	you can only
A	what was he on a?
B	turn your nose at things for so long
A	A work placement? What was that for?
B	well community it's a community order
A	oh okay
B	and you have to do work in the community
A	what in Tesco's?
B	anywhere
C	yes
A	I really wouldn't be surprised
C	mm
A	er
B	anywhere
A	the boss of Tesco's rubbing shoulders with
B	mm
A	David Cameron on one night in some
B	well
C	mm
B	I know what he'd done
C	mm
B	to the value of up to five thousand pounds
A	huh
C	oh wow
B	mm
A	blimey
C	mm
A	in
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and of course he was caught
A	mm
B	you know
A	well I wonder who was more on the take? Asda or him?
A	no honestly
B	yeah
C	oh yeah
B	it's a big con
C	they've overpriced their stuff
A	it's like yeah right
C	mm
A	there's probably percent on
C	yeah
A	but
B	it's a big con
A	it is all a big con
B	you have to er be very careful to keep your eye on the prices of the things that you use regularly
C	yeah
B	well a girl in in Morrisons yesterday was saying how much the price of cucumbers have gone up
C	yeah
B	and it'll go up more if we have drought conditions anyway
C	yeah I'm quite surprised that they haven't warned us in this area
B	mm
C	about water shortage because
B	hosepipe bans
A	is um
C	yeah
A	is it in this area as well?
C	no
A	or just in the South?
C	it's all
B	not yet
C	in the South and Southeast
A	mm
B	but it will do
C	mm
B	it will do
A	yeah
C	yes mm
A	sort all my
C	mm
A	so we're going to have to
B	really?
A	calculate
B	yeah but we can't
A	forty-two years
A	six months
B	yeah but it's difficult to to work that out
A	well it's not
B	we all use it
A	it was a fiver a week was it? Cos if
C	mm
A	I I use pretty much one of those bags
C	yeah
A	a week don't I
C	yeah
A	well my cats do
C	mm
A	and how much is one of those?
C	it's four pounds something
B	I can't remember how much the little ones are
C	no I've got the bill upstairs
B	meow
C	and said because there's only one damaged left on the counter and I wanted three or four can I take two of those at the same price as one of mine? And they did it
A	bless you
C	I've got the bill upstairs
A	but is it like four fifty? Or little bit closer to five?
C	I er er
A	you don't know
C	I can't remember
B	you don't owe me anything
A	mm
B	you paid me for the cat food
A	yeah
B	so you don't then
A	oh for the coat
C	mm
A	I haven't given you the money for the coat
B	right
C	mm
A	yeah
B	but that's all
A	I'm gonna wear it
B	you can't send it back now you've worn it
A	but I only wore it
C	I had meant to say do you want to pre-order another bag of your cat food while we're at the vets?
A	oh
C	and I forgot when we got there
B	mm
A	I should've
B	no I think you've had it too long now to return it
A	is that the twenty-eight days or something?
B	I I can't remember
A	oh well
B	mm
A	I only just hope it doesn't make me look like too much of a marshmallow when I'm wearing heels with it
B	I don't think it does at all
A	I do
C	come on Thorn
A	coming in? I do
A	shaped
B	right
A	it makes me look like a marshmallow
B	right
A	but the reason it's such a big bouffanty unshaped coat is that it's stuffed with down feathers
C	mm
A	unless she kind of gets a hoover out
B	and that really sort of defeats the object of having a down-filled coat doesn't it
C	mm
A	and deflates the
B	well
A	yes I will
C	mm
B	hopefully we won't have any more very cold weather
A	well
B	is it warmer than the two that you've been wearing?
A	it's definitely warmer
C	mm
A	definitely definitely
B	Good
A	yes
B	ooh my feet
C	for the summer when it comes
A	oh yeah
B	look just don't joke about things like that
B	just don't joke
C	well they say they really are concerned about the er the Gulf Stream
A	why?
C	changing
A	no
C	hmm
A	what about global warming?
B	well just be thankful it wasn't last winter is all I can say
A	oh gosh
C	mm
A	if that'd been
C	mm
B	Cos last winter was
A	oh
A	yes
B	mm
A	yeah
B	well it was colder than that wasn't it after Christmas
C	yes
A	and didn't it snow in November or something?
B	we had early snow
C	it started very early
B	didn't we
C	mm
B	it was horrible
C	mm
B	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
B	I reckon you
C	I've never had my boat on the water as early
B	mm
A	really?
C	mm
B	I reckon you owe us a hundred and fifty pounds for everything
B	twenty pounds a month
A	you've just put a random
B	well
A	ball-park figure on it
A	haven't you
B	twenty pounds for six months
B	simples
C	mm
A	so maybe you should've been the PE teacher er and
C	yes
A	she should've been the accountant
C	yeah
B	Don't think so
C	why? I can shout loudly
C	mm
B	no you do have to
C	mm
B	oh dear
A	um
C	I can
A	bill somewhere?
B	I can find it
C	I can access
A	okay
C	the history online anyway
A	sorry to make this complicated
C	yeah
A	no I'm just trying to find how many payments I've made
C	oh
A	to for for the fees
C	yeah
A	and how many payments they've made me for the bursary
B	mm
A	they want the bursary for January back
B	really?
A	yeah
C	in arrears or in advance
A	is that the word you use? In arrears?
C	in arrears
B	mm
C	yes
B	but they can't have it both ways
A	well the problem is it's two different departments
B	huh
A	different if they set different um tut
C	yeah
A	er guidelines
C	mm
B	mm
A	well they're just not looking at it holistically
C	mm
A	I mean they're in their complete right to set these guidelines and
B	but it seems unfair that they say we want your fees but we want your bursary back
A	yeah
B	that's not fair
A	whoever said anything was fair
B	no
B	but it's not right
C	mm
B	I would be arguing
C	mm
A	I've lived
B	that you can't have it both ways
A	I've lived
C	yes
A	through more unfair things
B	you forfeit
A	have that month that you deferred
B	oy oy oy oy
A	so I can see how the situation has arisen
C	mm
A	to see whether that February one was
B	mm
A	paid in arrears or not
B	but you need to speak to somebody
C	mm
B	as well
C	yeah
B	yes
C	talking to anybody
A	it's
B	but who did the letter come from?
A	um
C	the bursary I can understand completely
A	oh yeah
C	the fees
B	yes
C	that is mm
B	but I don't get the fees
A	no but the thing is if it wasn't the thing about they wanted the bursary back you probably wouldn't question that I had to pay fees for the month that I wasn't there but
C	mm
A	that I deferred in
B	mm
A	I can't remember when
C	mm
A	but if it if that situation was in isolation you probably wouldn't question it would you? You'd say
C	no
A	oh well yeah you were enrolled in January henceforth you should pay the fees for January
C	no I would say
A	it's just in comparison with
C	yeah
B	mm
C	continuing or not then they should make no charge for the month
A	yeah
B	mm
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah it it has to be put in a way that they've got discretion and they exercise the discretion
B	mm
A	but they probably don't have discretion
C	I
A	are the ones that don't
B	yeah but you need to just ask the question
C	mm
B	change their minds
C	mm
B	you might have somebody sensible and sympathetic on the other end of the phone
A	you never know
B	you never know
A	you never know
B	and Thorn's decided he likes that chair
B	mm
C	intently
A	I wish
B	silly boy
A	Barclays would just give you an online record of all the transactions you've made
B	yeah
A	my Spanish bank account
C	mm
B	it's too easy
A	but
C	yeah
A	as soon as I got back home and logged on to my bank account
C	you can see it
A	it would be there
C	yeah
B	mm
C	mm
A	now these don't even update them for two or three days
C	mm
C	on that
B	Jesus
C	yeah
B	hmm
A	really?
C	mm
B	mm
C	it could be arranged but it's for the I was glad for the opportunity to make it necessary for
B	yeah
C	because it was  it was  silly me doing some and
B	mm
C	but the big you know er things like electricity bill and builders and things like that
A	well it looks that I it looks like
C	did you not pay any by any other means at the start?
A	it doesn't look like it
C	you didn't pay on on a card?
A	well it would come up here
C	mm
A	if I had
C	well you could ask them for a detailed statement of the fees from the beginning of term
A	yep
C	so that you can reconcile it
A	actually I think they er they sent me an e-mail with the broken down sums of how much I would pay in the future
C	mm
A	to pay off the fees
B	mm
A	so maybe I should just find that
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yours I think
B	uh
A	it was like the um my Orange
C	the one?
A	the new phone
C	yeah
A	um
B	two messages
A	fifty free minutes to speak
C	mm
A	and I don't know how much information that you can download or you know
C	yeah
A	even though they say it's unlimited they do actually set a limit
C	there's a
C	there's a fair use policy
A	that's right
C	yeah
C	yes
A	not
C	yeah
B	mm
A	to see how many minutes you've got left
C	mm
A	so you never know
C	no
A	what data you
C	no
A	and it doesn't put a time
C	mm
B	dear God
C	that um the dongle I've got for using
B	mm
C	for my laptop when I'm down at the boat um I got on the screen is a bang up to date number of megabytes
A	mm
C	that I've used in today and the previous month and all told since the start
A	mhm
C	but it says mm er what I did was pay up front for a three month contract
A	right
C	and I'd been comparing what I'd been using
A	ah
C	I had set a warning
A	the first time you had like a
C	mm
A	in proportion
C	yeah
A	pro rata
C	and then suddenly I realized I could nowhere near
C	touch the capacity I
A	stop scratching
B	ay
B	just you watch it
C	but I've only got
B	cheeky monkey
C	you know I've got another month and a bit to go on it
A	why?
C	because you then go onto a pay daily or pay weekly or pay monthly contract
A	well why?
C	because it was a a three months' agreement
A	uh-huh
C	and it ends at three months
A	oh
C	yeah
A	mm
C	um
B	meow
A	hello
C	when that one is due to expire there is all I do is go back to er
A	is it Orange?
C	I can't remember
A	another phone
C	yes
A	provider?
C	yeah
A	some provider
C	T
A	T-Mobile
C	T
B	mm
C	mm
A	Will they let you get the same offer again? It's not?
C	well there's no reason why you shouldn't
A	is there nothing in the conditions that says
C	no
A	you can only
C	no
A	enjoy this offer once?
C	and Carphone Warehouse were doing that offer themselves
B	silly boy
C	on T-Mobile
A	oh Okay
C	um
B	silly boy
C	but it had just stopped with them when I
B	mm
C	and they were still doing it
B	grandma sent you a thousand dollars didn't she?
A	I don't know
B	yes
A	yeah I know but
B	she gave all her grandchildren
C	mm
B	a thousand dollars
A	so we
B	er nanny from the money for nanny to
C	Don't start complicating the issue
B	I'm just telling you what sort of exchange rate
C	yeah but that's that's
B	what are you talking about? That's just the exchange rate
A	well it's easier just to
B	fifty fifty-five pounds is eighty dollars
A	yeah but it'd be
C	no
A	easier just to put it into a calculator on the internet that just tells us how many pounds a thousand dollars is
B	excuse me
C	I I worked it all out at the time
B	no you didn't
C	I worked it all out at the time
B	give you a thousand dollars
C	no
B	I mean a hundred dollars
C	I  I don't I  don't remember how much it was but I documented it in the e-mails to
B	right
C	uh
B	wuh
A	mm
B	Don't you dare
A	I just don't know I don't uh
A	I don't know how many payments I should expect to
C	mm
B	look at the expression on his face
C	who me?
B	no
C	no I know
B	he's looking at her very strange
A	evil stare
A	she's gone
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	or hisses at him
A	mm
B	but Bear's terrified of him
A	aw
B	oh yes
B	because he's a wuss
C	oh he must be more than six weeks old
B	he's not
C	surely? Really?
B	mm
C	mm
B	he's only about six weeks old
C	mm
B	that's about it
A	oh maybe it was contagious
A	why my cat
B	no I don't think so
A	has had a
C	mm
A	poorly eye
B	I don't think so
C	just by you think she's been on Facebook together
A	yeah
A	I wish they when they gave you statements I wish they wouldn't print other things on the
C	oh er
A	back of it
C	it is it it
B	mm
A	it's
C	the
A	uh
C	decades ago they talked about computers saving paper
B	yeah
C	our electricity bills used to come on a piece of paper two-thirds the size of an A4
B	mm
A	mm
C	and you know they'd print back and front
B	with useless information
A	mm
C	and now every credit card statement I might get my average number of transactions on the credit cards is probably two or three a month
B	mm
C	it is stupid
A	ludicrous
B	crazy
C	and they're all A4 sheets now
A	yeah
C	instead of you know smaller
A	and this is thick paper too
B	mm
C	mm
A	they could at least use
C	yeah
A	recyclable paper
B	mm
A	recycled paper
B	uh
A	but what annoys me is that you can't file it properly
C	oh
A	see here for example I
C	yes
A	I've got
C	yeah
A	not all of the sides are
C	yeah
A	printed with the statement
C	yeah
B	mm
A	some of the sides are
C	mm
A	but as you said there's just so such a waste of
B	mm
A	I remember when I phoned them up because for me it's completely illogical to have a statement that starts with the least recent payment
C	the bank
B	no
C	from oldest to newest
B	yeah
C	that's been tradition
B	I would expect that
A	you see it's the opposite when you look at it online
B	Good God
A	so you get used to one way and then you see another one
B	oh
A	and my big bugbear with them
C	I've not  I've not  seen any systems that show online just the most recent
A	no
C	mm
A	that's what Barclays has on
C	mm
B	mm
A	and that's what my Spanish bank account has
B	mm
A	but also because I hadn't made any transactions in a year or I'd made less than
B	mm
A	eight in a year
C	mm
A	they sent me all of the ones for a year in no no no no wait there
A	tenth of February
C	oh right
B	helpful
C	yeah
A	and so I couldn't work out
B	mm
A	oh no that's right
C	mm
A	yeah so I had it started in March and it ended in March
C	mm
B	but which year?
A	but it didn't it wasn't clear
C	didn't
A	which
B	mm
A	year
C	which year
A	was which
C	yes
A	and I just assumed
B	yeah
A	that it was the
C	it was the same March
A	most recent
C	yeah
A	no I
C	mm
A	no I assumed no I didn't assume that it was the same March
C	oh
A	Cos there were
B	mm
C	right
A	payments in the
C	mm
A	recent
C	right
A	transaction
B	yeah
A	first
C	yeah
A	I thought six hundred quid had been taken out of my bank account that March
C	yeah
A	when I
C	mm
A	found out
C	mm
A	out of my bank account
A	and then I realized
C	mm
A	turned over the page and that there was another March at the bottom
C	yeah
B	God
A	and I said  and I said  to him look without the date without the year next
B	mm
A	to
C	mm
A	the transaction
B	yeah
A	you can understand
C	it's yeah
A	why I've
B	mm
A	had this panic
C	mm
A	not having the year next
B	oh delightful
A	and he said well you can see at the top of the bill
C	that't not
A	what about customers
C	mm
A	like me
B	mm
A	who have made so few transactions
B	mm
A	that you
B	er
A	have all the year
A	all the year on one statement
B	she'll crouch down and then she'll leap over the arm and dot him and then run away
A	yeah
A	go on  go on go on
A	get ready
A	get ready for him
C	hmm
B	oh dear
A	anyway
C	yeah
A	where my
B	mm
A	misunderstanding had
C	he was
A	occurred
B	mm
A	but he
C	one of those unhelpful ones
B	yes
C	mm
A	completely unhelpful
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh well no one else have ever complained
C	mm
A	I don't think you should be complaining to me about that
B	idiot
A	I'm like yeah but I just
C	no no
B	put me through to your supervisor
C	no say I am registering this as a complaint
B	mm
C	and they then have to
C	he can't he it's not him that decides whether it's reasonable or not
B	no
A	yeah
B	he has to follow procedure
B	is this month your last payment from Spain?
A	um
B	right
C	and even if it was it wouldn't be
B	it wouldn't be cos it's after six o'clock
C	mm
B	oh dear
A	we said that the other day in the
B	yes
A	car didn't we
C	mm
A	we said it at
C	mm
A	exactly the same moment as well
B	oh dear
C	yes
B	hasn't it
C	absolutely
C	mm
A	sorry
B	I'd just asked you if you'd had your last payment from Spain
A	mm
B	and you said yes but it wouldn't be till next month
A	yeah
B	oh dear
A	so that's
B	life gets very complicated
A	another thing to see whether I can transfer some money over from Spain
C	mm
A	I haven't kept an eye on the value of the euro
C	I haven't
A	yay
A	well done Thorn
C	you do move fast when you want to don't you Thorn
B	mm
A	he he told her
C	mm
A	Good boy  good boy
B	the one outside the Post Office
A	Good boy
B	I think was
A	Good boy
B	one twelve
A	Good boy
C	mm
A	I know
C	I er
B	but
A	to
C	yeah
A	I don't know if it's been
C	I would imagine if anything it's been relatively stable
B	mm
A	really?
C	because they've sort of agreed that support for Greece
B	mhm
C	so the the pressure on
B	yep
C	the euro has lessened a bit for the time
A	Good
C	and depressed as it was
A	mm
C	but if you want
A	well maybe I should just leave it over there
C	to check at any time O and A dot com
A	oh no I look at
C	mm
A	xE
C	oh right
A	dot com
C	mm
A	but yeah
C	mm
A	I saw in
C	sound like
A	see that doesn't sound like a bad exchange rate for buying
C	well it it it might've been
A	oh but wait wait though
C	without seeing
B	I think that's
C	the full story it's
B	them buying from you
C	no
B	I really don't know
C	I would think
B	mm
A	really?
C	yeah
A	hmm
C	mm
A	and the
C	well you
A	exchange rate that they applied was quite
C	yeah but
A	was quite decent
C	Will will they not also apply a currency charge?
A	it didn't look like they had
C	mm
A	oh right
C	so you could find that there's a charge for cash drawing
B	mm
C	of a couple of pounds each time
A	well nothing came up on the statement to that effect
C	mm
B	mm
C	yeah
B	well maybe they didn't then
A	I dunno
B	it's all too complicated for me
A	and the problem is nowadays you get the feeling that they make it complicated so
C	oh yeah
A	as to
B	oh yeah
A	pull the
C	yeah
A	wool over your
C	mm
A	eyes
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	so that you don't realize
B	mm
A	like the Orange bill the first one they sent me was on paper
B	mm
A	but they'd charged me one pound eighty to send me a paper bill
B	God
A	you have to log in to your online
B	hmm
A	account if you want to change that
C	mm
A	however they make it so difficult for you to find the little bit that says er online statements not paper statements
B	oh God
A	yep
B	which is the least expensive?
A	it's absolutely ludicrous
B	mm
A	complicated
B	which is the least expensive option?
A	well I mean er
B	to upgrade the account?
C	normally online
B	or paper?
A	well it depends
C	mm
A	Cos you you I don't know how long I'm gonna be with them
B	mm
C	mm
A	but again you just get the feeling that they're making it complicated so that you
B	mm
A	or er that it's just so complicated that you don't
B	you don't bother
A	bother
C	mm
A	doing it
B	yeah
A	which is extremely annoying
B	yep
C	yeah so it's like
A	sorry
C	the airlines have been
B	mm
C	looking for ways to
A	yeah
C	charge
B	yep
C	loads of extra things in
A	yeah
C	what they charge
B	they charge you for checking in your bag
C	mm
B	um
A	paying
C	yes
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	charge a credit card payment
C	and those have gone
A	even a debit card payment
C	yeah
B	mm
C	those have gone from er
B	mm
C	it used to be two pounds or two pound fifty
B	mm
C	and now quite often it's seven or eight pounds
B	mm
A	yeah
C	so the suitcases were five or six pounds
B	yeah
C	and now they're twenty pounds
B	yep
C	plus in some
B	yeah
C	places
B	I think some charge you thirty
C	and they try the one I booked for going to Glasgow with Flybe um they make it very difficult not to take the insurance
B	mm
C	which is another cost
B	she was booking her insurance as well
C	she was  she was  accepting the insurance
B	bloody hell
C	mm
B	yes
C	mhm
B	you've still got the one from the bank?
C	yes
B	do you have to update them on to anything about anything that's happened to you?
C	no
B	well what about
C	mm
B	the medical insurance?
C	you don't have overseas medical insurance
B	er
C	oh wait a minute
B	no we've got Greece is
C	what I need to check is the
A	er
B	hey
A	stop scratching
C	what I have to check is that it hasn't changed with me turning seventy
B	mm
C	because some of them do stop at seventy
B	but er do you mean to tell me we've been going on all these holidays without any medical insurance?
C	no
B	yeah I know but
A	but you've been to European countries haven't you? So you're always covered
B	as long as they're part of the EU
C	mm
A	that's why I said EU countries
B	well Greece is
C	mm
A	yeah for the moment
B	no you said E er European
C	yes
B	um
C	mm
B	yeah
C	and as I say check the age
B	yeah
C	thing as well
B	Cos that's the last thing we need
C	mm
B	Cos that's when we go to Australia again that's something you will have to check
C	mm
B	yes
C	I need the exercise
B	well take your slippers off then
A	do you do it to make the squeaky noise? Is that the objective of the?
B	no
C	I can't hear it so it doesn't matter
B	yeah
A	have you not got your hearing aid in?
C	no
A	have you stopped wearing it?
B	yes
A	why?
B	Cos he doesn't like it
A	Don't
B	I know what the answer is
A	I know
C	see I don't even need to hear the questions do I
A	so tell me
C	um
A	yeah
C	in the car
C	and in a situation like this as long as I am aware somebody is talking to me
C	I don't have a problem
C	my concern is that the hearing in that ear is so bad that it will never get to be a help
C	to some extent
B	hmm
C	oh it is
B	couldn't it
C	yeah
B	it's not like the other ear
C	not on a comparison with my left
B	no
C	no
B	mm
C	that er
B	mm
A	are there any situations in which you do find it helpful?
C	when I'm driving at about fifteen miles an hour and able to talk to your mother
C	assuming she's sitting next to me in the car
B	does help
B	does help
C	yeah but you don't have to repeat everything if you make me aware you're talking to me
B	tut huh and that's very hard work
C	but we
B	it's much easier
C	while we're sat here you haven't had to
B	yes
C	yeah
B	going
C	well I don't know
B	and it gets very wearing
C	whether you're talking to me or the cats
C	mm
A	maybe you need a little traffic light or something
B	no
C	do you remember
C	if I have a shock collar on
B	no just wear the hearing aid
C	and you press a button
B	I understand there are situations where it is not practical
B	which he does
B	you call say pardon? But no
B	you what?
A	Don't
B	that's exactly how he says it
A	yeah I'm sure he doesn't
B	he does
C	I got fed up with saying
B	that's exactly what he
C	say again? And I do say that sometimes
B	yes he does
A	say sorry?
C	because that's
A	sorry
B	no it's condensed now hopefully to say?
B	but it's the tone of voice
B	it's not what did you say? Say? It drives me round the bend
C	I wonder how they're gonna transcribe that
A	undistinguishable
A	squawk
B	the squawk
C	sorry
B	was actually the squawk was actually the way er the word say
B	and the previous
B	just so that we make it clear
A	oh I'm one statement missing
C	oh no
A	tut
C	not behind you is it?
A	no
C	what's those behind you?
A	oh these this is all the surplus paper
C	yeah
A	they've sent me
A	that I don't need
C	yeah
B	what time's your yoga?
A	six thirty
B	oh
A	pff
B	you silly boy
A	so
B	we can fix arrangements for Monday on Sunday can't we
A	yep
B	mhm
B	mhm
A	yep
C	when's the when is Mother's Day?
B	Sunday
C	and that's when we're at?
B	going to
C	right
A	so what yeah what's the plan? Cos I was just er wondering if I can fit yoga in on Sunday morning
B	thirty
C	how long is yoga?
A	well it's
C	well I
A	quarter to twelve
C	yeah
B	mhm
C	pick your mother up
B	mhm
C	I could come and collect you
B	take you over to
A	are you sure?
B	mm
C	mm
A	you don't mind?
C	no
B	are you planning to do Abe some time on Sunday?
A	well I did Abe the other day
B	oh you did?
C	mm
B	oh right
A	Abe and Pat did an hour
B	Good
A	yeah
B	hallmarks?
A	the hallmarks
C	mm
B	mhm
A	and it is it says nineteen seventeen
B	mm
A	so it was probably made in nineteen seventeen
B	mm
C	mm
B	well you know the history of it?
A	yeah
B	so that sounds about right
B	mm
A	Cos it
B	mm
A	when she bought it for her engagement ring it was already a second-hand ring wasn't it? When she bought it it was second-hand?
B	that I don't know
A	I think
C	that rings a bell
A	I think so cos
C	yeah
B	I really don't know
C	or something like that
A	and it
B	could be
A	numerically in the years
B	well no you see it no no it was actually given to nanny no given to
A	no
B	to nanny
B	yeah
B	but it was that was
A	and then left it to me in her will
B	yeah
B	no that was much further er er along ago
A	uh-huh
B	it wasn't um that sort of era
A	what was?
B	that the girl who had it as her engagement ring was killed
A	oh
B	in a motorcycle accident
A	no cos er I had
B	with her fiancé
A	understood that nanny
A	that it had been given to nanny in the nineteen sixties
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	one would imagine that when she
C	mm
A	bought it it was already second-hand
C	yeah
B	but exactly what the journey between nanny and
A	well
B	oh no I don't think she nicked it out of nanny's jewellery box
A	borrowed it
B	I think it was
C	mm
B	er another case of
A	mhm
B	Cos I think it I don't know whether
A	excuse me
B	it might've been passed to grandma
A	no
B	yes
A	no it was given to nanny
B	mm
A	by a lady who worked with nanny at
B	no
A	yes
B	no
C	have you got that on
C	have you got that on
B	no
A	do you maybe not agree with me?
B	no
A	well nanny told me that this was this ring was given to her by a lady with whom she worked in
B	well that's the first I've heard of it being somebody from
A	maybe because you're remembering it wrong
B	well whatever
B	mm
A	uh
B	but I thought it was much further back than that
A	in what respect?
B	that nanny got it and
B	but I thought it was much further back
A	that what was much further back?
B	that nanny got the ring and
A	oh right
C	way way before nanny got to
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
C	mm
A	oh we'll ask her on Sunday
B	mm
A	how is her memory?
B	um
C	she's forgotten to say please and thank you
A	yeah
B	she never learnt how to say that
B	um
C	yeah
B	to me
C	she doesn't remember dates and I it's probably very much like um she doesn't make an effort to remember them because she knows that your mother will
B	er
C	take responsibility
A	mm
B	I don't know
C	runs in the family then
B	and there was one one occasion a couple of weeks ago
C	mm
