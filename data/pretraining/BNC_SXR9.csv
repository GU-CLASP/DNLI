A	you're a big you're
B	you have the rest of the
B	like
C	no no
A	you know I was watching think I was watching I think it was the big questions or free speech it was one of those
B	mm mm?
A	and it was just it was like the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life it was
C	was he Asian or white?
B	yeah there are so many
A	yeah he's Pakistani
C	oh I think I've heard of erm
A	yeah and then they were there's a debate a debate show and he was saying his question was erm
C	do you feel like religions need to accept people if they're gay and stuff?
B	yes
A	erm
B	should read an open letter
A	I feel like they should
A	okay fair enough right if if you don't agree with it
C	yeah
A	but I don't think you should act based on that opinion of yours
B	yeah
A	I think you should just leave that opinion to the back of your head
C	yeah?
A	and I think you should treat them exactly the same
C	yeah
C	but I don't think people need to
A	yeah
C	that's
A	to try and get marriage illegal
B	yeah
A	religious and non religious people spend big money to do things like that
B	I dunno
C	oh Reza Aslan
B	yeah I love that
A	what do you think about that?
C	erm
B	what do you think about it
C	as a father
A	okay erm
unknown_female	mm mm mm
A	I think it just becomes difficult I think
B	why would they would be religious?
A	I think
B	okay
C	why who would be religious?
A	someone who's gay
C	erm well the thing is there are
B	every religion is an interpretation of of
C	which could accept it
B	scripture
B	or misogyny
C	and then
B	or killing nature
C	they said okay no we we no that was wrong cos look at these Bible quotes that say it's wrong that they did that
B	yeah
C	so
B	so just
C	well why are they perfect?
B	think that's
C	the thing is that you can't say that Islam for Islam
A	yeah
B	I know that's what the
C	Quran is the perfect
B	I know
C	there are multiple interpretations but
B	and
C	but
B	yeah
B	I just think it's
A	I think it I just think it becomes too complicated
B	mm
A	I think you have to begin to
B	in what way?
C	like you can't even connect to it
B	right
C	just a
B	I think they always try and highlight
C	the thing is it it sounds weird because they don't encourage any like individual thought they encourage repetition of what people said like
B	yeah
C	they don't encourage you to
B	right
C	this is why it's just so boring
C	it's so boring
B	does the process involve you thinking for yourself anyway though?
C	no it's
B	right yeah
C	there is erm a book about Muslims er Young British and Muslim
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	it's got some
B	good ten minute read?
C	is it good?
B	yeah
C	but lot of it's like
B	uhu
C	and stuff
B	yeah
