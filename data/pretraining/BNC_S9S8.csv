A	are you tired?
A	how was this evening?
B	yeah it was good it was alright we did learn to skate but we had to do the new warm up for the new course so that was interesting
A	what do you mean? what's the new warm up?
B	erm the new course skate skate excellence which has taken the place of learn to skate we get to wear these jazzy boot covers and erm we have to do like a warm up with them so they get warmed up for their lesson basically that they have and then they have so much lesson time
A	so what's the point of the boot covers?
B	erm they've got like left and right on them and then they've got different colours to correspond with edges and things like that
A	oh right so as you
B	you go onto your orange edges your yeah
A	oh right
B	but it's erm confuses me
B	my brain it doesn't work that way so erm
B	yeah I'm not finding it
A	oh never mind
B	but er it's okay I'm sure I'll get it
A	yeah you usually do it's just sometimes your brain takes a minute or two longer or a bit longer because of the left right thing as well doesn't it?
B	yeah well they've got L and R on the boots and you have different coloured gloves on each hand for left and right
A	yeah but left and right doesn't help you cos your brain thinks of left and as being the right one because
B	yeah
A	that's the dominant one
B	I know it just gets easily confused but er it'll be alright I suppose
A	ah
B	in the end I just I'm struggling with the idea of colours and doing things like that
A	yeah cos I suppose you just do a certain move without thinking of it as a colour so when you have to think what colour is that move
B	yeah but it's also just the way that my brain learns things so it
A	mm
B	it erm I learn better from watching and having things broken down slowly
A	mm
B	than having
A	yep
B	that doesn't make sense to me whereas if you break it down and do the moves slowly and I'll watch it and then I get it and then I can do it
A	mm so do you think do you find then with the people that are learning it on the learn to skate course do you spot the ones that are struggling and maybe try and show them how to do it?
B	well we've we've not got any actually doing it at the minute cos we've our level isn't doing it the girls we've got on our level
A	oh right
B	aren't actually doing it yet it's the new ones that are coming in that are starting it we just did the warm up with everybody cos they wanted to do it for some reason erm
A	mm
B	the problem is though you've gotta stick to the course you can't it's not as as easily adjustable as learn to skate because learn to skate you get told the move
A	right
B	and then you teach the move the way that you teach it
A	yeah
B	whereas this is now more you do this with the colours you go onto your orange
A	mm
B	any experience of anybody learning it yet but we'll see
A	yeah I suppose cos everybody learns things differently so that actually isn't necessarily gonna cater for everybody
B	no it's very based for kids and it's
A	oh
B	it's been designed by a woman that's got dyslexia so for her it probably makes sense the whole way to learn but for me
A	mm
B	it's my idea of my nightmare way of learning cos I if you just tell me something so just
A	mm
B	if you taught me how to do a for example er a a crossover and you said you take your left leg you push out you cross your left leg over your right leg
A	mm
B	hold your right leg under and you move it out
A	yeah
B	er when I first learned wouldn't wouldn't be able to do it
A	no cos for me by about the second bit of that being said I'm trying to think well hang on which is my right leg my which the left?
B	yeah
A	er to to what? but what did you say?
B	yeah whereas if I watch it really slow
A	yeah
B	then I get it which is
A	yeah that's what I I tend to learn more like that
B	yeah I said to
A	mm
B	at
A	yeah
B	but we do arms with it
A	mm
B	and I couldn't figure out which way I was doing my arms with my legs and it took me a good year to figure out I said most of the time I just waved my arms around
B	just sort of bring them round cos er it's like
A	mm
B	what I'm doing and
A	well yeah exactly
B	just took a while
A	and if she'd said oh you do this this and this you'd go
B	no
A	so you just
B	I struggle with thinking out which way my arms
A	with what everybody else's arms were doing
B	yeah my arm which way my arm goes across my body and
B	sorry
A	oh sorry I'm tired
B	I'm tired
A	mm what time are you going into work tomorrow?
B	haven't decided
B	I know probably like aim for eightish eight half eight
A	mm
B	cos Rainbows start back tomorrow
A	does it?
B	yeah
A	erm er you haven't done a planning meeting have you?
B	nope haven't got anything planned
B	no just do a games night tomorrow
A	yeah and ideas as what you could say to the Rainbows
B	I've got loads of ideas
A	what what are their favourite things that they like to do
B	they
A	yeah
B	they like baking
A	yeah well you could have the Great Rainbow Bake Off
A	no
B	but
A	did they come back to you about the accounts?
B	no I'm still waiting for it back and I need my
A	mm
B	so I'm just still waiting on that
B	but hey
A	hey
A	I decided I need to buy some boots for the winter
B	shopping from the comfort of your own home
A	well that's how I do all of it now so I decided I need to buy some boots but before I started buying boots I saw there was twenty-five percent off on tops so I had to look at the tops
A	because obviously there's twenty-five percent off on the tops er so I found a few tops and then I started thinking about er the boots but actually I want to get some new jeans to go with the boots so then I looked at all the jeans and
A	and got some jeans and then I looked at boots and then I thought actually what else do I need? I need underwear so in my saved items
A	not that I'm necessarily going to buy all of them cos I think I'm gonna fall off my chair in a minute when I see thirteen items oh it doesn't say total that's probably good actually
B	bag zero
A	yeah no that's it cos er it drops out the bag after about erm after about an hour or something
B	stop moving it
A	sorry see those shirts right
B	yeah
A	used to wear those all the time with jeans
B	yeah
A	and they're coming back in and this is why they say whatever you have with fashion if it's still good don't throw it away what are you looking at?
B	I'm adding
A	oh oh gosh no don't do that that's too scary
A	so they say don't throw it away cos it'll come back
B	yeah
A	it's like now all the bootcut and flare jeans are coming back
B	yeah
A	so I'm obviously having to get some of those although I did actually save one real good pair of my bootcut jeans
B	yeah
A	so
A	I have still got them
A	I just need to get the the boots to wear with them
B	yeah
A	are you still adding? oh no what? shall I be scared?
B	we'll see in a minute I just need to concentrate while I'm adding
A	one two three four
B	no
A	thirteen items
A	how much?
B	I'm there and it's three hundred and fifty
A	ah
B	erm so three hundred and fifty and then four hundred and twenty-five four hundred and thirty-five hundred and ten what's that? five hundred and ninety-five so let's do six hundred and five six hundred and twenty-seven pounds
A	and I'm gonna get two of those
B	six hundred and thirty-seven pounds
B	so probably a no to all of that
A	well no well I'll get it and then I'll only keep one pair of boots so I've got three pairs of boots and I'll keep one there's four pairs of jeans and I'll keep one maybe two and I potentially could
B	ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
A	I just think that's really funny and then it says here oh no it says here on on on the side bit there erm it says er be yourself everybody else is taken
A	I think that's really good
B	on your boob
A	yeah on your boob at the side mind you people are gonna come and go what does that say?
B	yeah
A	and I'll go no
B	totally unfit
A	ah it'll be alright so er I'm gonna order these and then they'll come and it'll be cos see like I say to
B	yeah but you do actually have to pay for them
A	order a couple
B	mm
A	this way this is my shop and I'm looking buying try like trying trying choose choose choose choose different sizes different colours if I think maybe cos the jeans some of them I'm not quite sure exactly what size then they'll all come I'll stand in the bedroom with
B	yeah but you still have to pay for them initially
A	yeah but if I've got the money in the account
B	I know I know I know I know
A	and then try everything on then send it back free
B	I haven't sent those jeans back yet
A	haven't you? you need to do that or else they'll charge them to you well they have done
B	it's alright I'll just do an exchange they usually exchange they don't mind how long you have it until you exchange
B	I just I don't know whether to send them back or what to do cos
A	well do you like them or not?
B	yeah but they don't fit
A	well
B	no they're not far off though but so I can
A	so do you think you need to exchange for a bigger size? or you just think hopefully you'll get into them?
A	well exchange for a bigger size if it's too big send it back and then in a few weeks
B	yeah
A	order again cos it
B	yeah
A	if you buy them and keep them think oh I'll have them when I get into them that could be six months before you get down actually just that er cos although you'll lose weight and tone up more the little bit where you need where you need the weight maybe on your stomach or on your hips
B	yeah I know I just annoying cos like I say erm I'm in between two
A	mm
B	so my ones I've got at the minute are too big and fall down but the ones that are smaller er they fit
A	mm
B	but they're just a bit tight on my tummy
A	yeah
B	so cos they're low-rise where they sit doesn't look nice
A	mm
B	but I'm in between
A	I don't like low-rise cos they tend to
B	yeah
A	squeeze in and pop out the bit you don't wanna pop out
B	I don't mind them
A	no I like high-
B	when I sit down er they're fine
A	or the medium-rise ones
B	I need to get some new leggings as well cos my leggings are too big they're falling down see?
A	oh yeah well you've so you've definitely lost weight so you should treat yourself to some new clothes
A	but the trouble is though you you look at the different sizes and you can get a ten a twelve or a fourteen and fit in all of them in different shops
B	I know
A	different sizes it's just ridiculous
B	mm we know my problem with jeans they don't really design them for bums
A	no
B	jeans are designed for no bums
A	yeah
B	because they give you the material for no bums when you've got a bum you get a size that's big enough to fit your bum but falls down
A	mm
B	and then I can't I don't like wearing tight belts so
A	but it's like you and
B	yeah
A	make one pair of jeans
B	yeah
A	cos she's short with no bum
B	yeah
A	and you're tall like long legs with a nice bum
B	mm yeah
A	I must admit I am very lucky with jeans cos I do just have the right shape for them
B	mm you do just fit into them
A	I do
B	that's why I wear jeggings cos jeggings just stretch
A	mm
B	and then I can wear skinny
A	mm
B	so I just live in jeggings but I'd rather not like in jeggings I'd rather get some jeans but cos they last longer jeggings don't last long
A	no but they are cheaper than jeans usually aren't they? are they?
B	some aren't the ones I got were like about the same price as jeans
A	oh right
B	but they do last they're good quality the ones I got from ASOS they they last quite well but
A	mm yeah but I can't wear
B	keep buying them in in the in the like can't remember
A	er mm yes I know that but then next to it it does say size ten or something
B	doesn't on the ones I bought
A	oh well it has on the ones that I bought
B	oh cos the ones I bought whatever it was would be
A	there's there's some which are size ten to twelve so I thought oh I'll just try those as well
A	just in case erm I can't if the ten's no good usually it is
B	mm
A	but then sometimes I'll get ten and I can't get it up my legs
B	yeah
A	and you think well I am
B	mm
A	a ten but never mind
B	I don't even know what size I am any more
A	no the thing is
B	not really bothered
A	it it doesn't matter the size itself doesn't matter and that's the point
B	it does
A	but you need to have that as a guide cos you need to try and say I like those in that size please
B	it does I refuse to buy anything above a fourteen ever
A	do you?
B	because I'm not above a fourteen so
A	well you're not but just if they make something and they decide it's a sixteen
B	I just won't buy it
B	out of defiance
B	it is it's defiance
A	I'd chop the label out
B	it it doesn't matter I know what they are
A	yeah
B	and er I I don't want to
A	no
B	cos I'm not a size sixteen so I wouldn't buy a size sixteen
A	well no you're not a size sixteen
B	so I wouldn't buy one
A	no
B	so therefore it's defiance and I will not buy it
B	I'm rebelling against the designer makers
A	are you gonna go to bed? pardon? am I? yeah
A	tired being
A	snores
B	snores twenty hours
A	turns over coughs
A	scratches
B	oh dear
A	mm

A	alright
B	okay
A	okay well I'll see you
