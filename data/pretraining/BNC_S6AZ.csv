B	hole in the cucumber
A	but you know that on that awful programme I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here
B	yeah
A	where they eat maggots and things don't they?
B	and spiders
A	and spiders and
B	but the spiders will crawl around in them wouldn't they?
A	I know I think I well honestly I just think eating live things is yucky but yeah they probably would wriggle a little bit wouldn't they?
B	yeah they'd go and then probably feast on your digesting food
A	no cos you'd crush them very quickly wouldn't you?
B	mm
A	but I could never do that in a million years
A	mm
C	but that was so just gross
B	it would be weird if it was it would be really scary if
A	oh that would be a good like horror story wouldn't it?
B	yeah the invincible spider
A	if you could feel it wriggling in your tummy
B	yeah
C	and actually sick
B	and then it and then it eats through you and then it eats your stomach it started off on I'm a Celebrity Out Get Me Out
A	oh my god
B	then it eats your stomach and your ribs until there's nothing you can digest and nothing to digest it with
A	oh
B	and then the spider takes over your brain and you become a giant spider
A	oh my god that's horrible
A	I'll tell my friend
B	oh boy is he gonna have
C	oh
B	a good one
A	he's like the nicest man ever though but he does write horrible stories
B	er well tell him
A	okay
B	and then it's it's called the attack of the invincible spiders and then they
A	okay
C	I know what it is yeah yeah
B	it takes over their brain
A	shush
B	it takes over their brain
A	mm
B	and then they twitch a bit and then they sick out and then they sick out spiders and then all the spiders crawl up and eat them
C	ah
A	oh my god
B	they crawl over their body and
C	no
A	then chew them to bits
A	right let's have a nice story let's talk about nice things
B	tell your friend
A	I will tell him I will post it on Facebook
B	ho ho
A	it's there's a there was a
B	can I write it with him?
A	yeah
B	yes out of school by a story
C	mm
B	hey we could work on it during your party
A	yeah I shall invite him definitely yeah
B	yeah
A	there is a film called Alien which is horrible and I've never seen it where erm an alien somehow gets inside erm a man and then bursts out of his stomach
B	yeah
A	horrible
B	didn't that happen in
A	oh in Spaceballs?
B	yeah
A	that was the the parody of it
B	mm
A	mm so it was doing a sort of copycat funny version of it
B	mm
A	but I've never seen the original cos I I don't like scary films
B	er neither do I I don't like scary books but if you're writing it
A	mm
B	it kinda has a different effect
A	it does doesn't it? cos I can definitely think of scary story ideas and write them yeah
B	but if you
A	but I don't wanna read them
B	yeah
A	cos then they're in my head forever
B	I know
C	I would like that
A	mhm
B	I know exactly what I'm going I think I'll try and design a front cover idea
A	mm
B	hmm
A	well terrified of a spider I expect
B	yeah but I want to do
A	oh now are these spiders sort of genetically mutated? or have they come from outer space? or what's happened? why are they like that? why are they killer spiders?
B	oh I think it should be in
C	huh I've got an idea
A	okay
B	and then when the meteor crashed erm I know it's a bit of I know it's just a giant ball of erm ice so that
A	mm
B	and then er radiation from the meteor
A	mm
B	turned the spider and kept the spider the same size but it made it so it could take control over humans and stuff
A	mm
B	and then on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here it got
A	mm
B	and then it was dropped and then it was swallowed and then it was crawling and then
A	alright we've done that bit now hang on cos
C	I've got an idea about the story
A	so okay you've got an idea about the story
C	how about the person eats the spider
A	mm
B	but then
B	they
C	when it comes out they actually eat the spiders they they like I suppose the spiders burst out of this as well cos the spider
B	yeah loads of them
C	and then they crawled down the drain
A	right
C	and into their bed
A	oh my goodness
C	and that night the spiders turns actually out to be tiny cute chickens
A	that would be my horror film
C	which turn out to be soft play toys
A	okay
B	de de de but inside the play toys were thousands of the mutation spiders so it's almost cuddly behind
C	no but it's inside
A	didn't I tell you that
C	no
A	shh
B	yeah I'm gonna read it to you
A	I don't want you to read it
C	no I'm scared of chickens
B	I'll help him write it I'll help him write it
A	no you'll not
B	I'll help him write it I don't like chickens
C	I want
A	you don't mind chickens
B	I hate them
A	you like you like eating them
B	yeah cos they're tasty
A	oh did you know there was a really nasty dog attack in a park erm yesterday
B	no
A	up up north nowhere near here
C	good
B	was it a Staffie?
A	but eleven eleven yeah it was a Staffie eleven
B	oh
A	children were were bitten and three of them had to be in hospital overnight how awful is that?
B	Staffies are basically wolves
A	mm mm wolves are nothing like that but those particular types of dogs
B	yes Staffies are vicious
A	and Pitbulls are very aggressive but that's partly the breeding of them they have been bred to be killers because we used to use them for hunting
B	hunting
A	like rats and things
C	ah poor mice
A	so you can't really blame it on the animals
A	cos dogs are so it will have to be put down though
C	what? uh
A	mm it'll have to be
B	no
A	it'll have to be killed cos it's a dangerous dog
C	actually I think they should be in zoos
A	well no darling we don't have dogs in zoos
C	but maybe she was walking with the lead and the dog kinda chewed on the lead and ran away?
A	I don't know but
B	what was it acting like a Labrador?
A	it was just sort of having they I think all the children were laughing and it was leaping up and just yeah it wasn't er it wasn't doing anything horrible at first and then it just went crazy
B	was it acting like a normal dog?
A	mm
C	I think
B	was it acting like a really friendly dog?
A	mm
B	mm wow there might be something else behind that
A	I don't know it's just very strange isn't it?
B	but it might have seen something?
A	mm
C	maybe somebody did that
A	oh I know I hope not
C	to get a
B	it could have been shot with a erm it could have been shot with something that makes it vicious
A	no no no nothing happened like that it was just I think it was in the park with these children and something triggered whatever in its brain and made it crazy but yeah it's really shocking isn't it?
B	yeah
C	I'm sad
A	mm
C	because erm normally dogs never do that
A	no
C	a little bite cos they're scared of you
A	mm
C	but not so bad have to be in hospital
A	I know
B	Staffies are very powerful dogs though
A	they are
C	what happened?
B	they might it might have seen something in the trees or something?
A	but that wouldn't justify attacking the children I mean why did it get into the park?
C	I'm going to have nightmares now
A	well you mustn't have nightmares it's very unusual I mean that's
C	okay I can't have my third portion
