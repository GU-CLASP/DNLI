A	right
B	right
A	yes
A	and it was it's me
B	gosh
A	and I don't think anywhere possibly in China was that much
B	right
A	so so the the difference between Beijing on a bad day and London is er is a is a different erm er you know different kind of
B	category?
A	category altogether really
B	mm mm
A	and it's just
B	mm
A	it it it was a fascinating
B	mm
A	and the antiques are appearing in the Antiques Roadshow and various places all over the
B	mm
A	all over the world that the Chinese now want to er repatriate as many antiques as possible
B	mm
A	erm and er and I think a lot of their
B	mm
A	er er it is for tourists I'm not sure if they still really think
B	mm
A	erm
B	well well it's a bit like the National Trust isn't it? because the National Trust erm get homes donated to them to the country
A	yeah
B	and then they have to then furnish them again and look for antiques and they buy a lot of antiques for things to go in the National Trust so it's exactly the same thing but the
A	mm
B	aunt Flo's old bowl or something that nobody thought was any great value
A	yeah
B	but to the Chinese it can be worth a huge amount of
A	yeah it it it
B	mm
A	an awful lot of money and erm
B	mm
A	absolutely phenomenal er the the art and the the skill er because they didn't have all the modern equipment that we have today so they er you could you could see what sort of skills they had
B	mm
B	mm
A	yes yes indeed
B	and when people rubbish acupuncture and that sort of erm thing
A	yeah
B	really erm they don't really know what they're talking about because that that's been practised for for many years and if it's practised properly it has a beneficial result
A	mm
B	and a lot of erm Chinese medicine all the herbs and that sort of thing they're the origins in a lot of proprietary medicines today
A	mm mm
B	and that's worth erm thinking about
A	yeah I I yeah I think there was an
B	mm
A	but I I think erm what we didn't erm er what what could've been carried on a separate talk was
B	yes
B	oh yes
A	that that would've been er or silk erm
B	yes
A	er we had a a talk on feng shui erm and we had lots of talks about the history but the history is so
B	right
A	so vast that erm
B	carry on
A	okay
B	yes
A	there were huge numbers of people
A	and and they're going
B	yeah
A	quite remarkable
B	it is
A	how how they're quite skilful they're holding holding their obviously holding their breaths
B	yeah
A	well not
B	they've got these sort of like
A	mm
B	the actual canoe is attached to their waists
A	yeah yeah
B	which is erm really interesting
A	yeah they're they're very I don't think they'll I don't think they've got any hope of going up that weir
A	but maybe what they're trying to do is to practise
B	turning on a wave?
B	oh
A	you you have to you have to cope with the erm the currents and the erm
B	anyway well shall we go back to China?
A	mm yeah yeah indeed yeah so so er just so we we
B	right
A	so so we
B	yes
A	we had a we had a very good flight and
B	did you sleep at all on the flight?
A	er yeah I had a
B	yeah
A	you'll see
B	right
A	and and and and the
B	oh
A	er but the I mean this looks better on the erm on a on a larger screen but the the the the er decoration and everything er on on some of these things
B	describe what we're looking at here
A	it's a it's a erm
B	portico?
A	yeah I I think when I say ancient it's a lot of what you see in China isn't it looks old but it may not be it may be
B	oh dear
A	erm so the Brits didn't have a a great erm
B	sympathy
B	right
A	er in the nineteenth century erm
B	mm
A	land er big
B	mm
A	but and they've always been very kind of they've always been quite warring kinda nation and they've got had warlords and and that sort of thing and and very and they haven't been really interested to go outside but at one stage the emperor was thinking about doing more business with west to with Europe and opening up and that's in the nineteenth century and then he had
B	mm
A	but
B	uhu
A	he said he would only bow to his her majesty or his
B	mm
A	he you know he will never bow to anyone else
B	umbrage?
A	yeah umbrage and erm wouldn't do any business with with the
B	mm mm
A	where erm er as I believe the erm Britons were er British were ended up profiteering from er selling er opium to the Chinese creating a lot of erm drug erm drug dens in China
B	mm
A	er and and profiteering on on on that basis
B	mm mm
A	until erm and
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and it was it was always kept in the marble slab drawer in the hallway do you remember? that was years and years it was there with the gloves and what not
A	oh I do yes I do
B	and she would never take it out and put it on show because she'd found out it was an opium pipe
A	oh
B	and it was for drugs and she was erm and we got and we got rid of it I can't remember
A	I
B	I bet you that was
A	mm
B	erm she hung onto it for ages and ages
A	mm
B	erm and er yes erm that's one of the things you know if you took it to an Antiques Roadshow
A	mm mm
B	it was very old then
A	yeah
B	so it it may have been worth a huge amount of money but we didn't erm
A	no don't know
B	yeah she she
A	mm
B	well it it was erm
A	mm
B	anyway so China again
A	so China so erm
B	tower
A	er towers erm erm and
A	rooms which the the the emperor erm and his er family er lived and I I think they also have oh there's the female lion
B	right
A	with the cub under her left claw
B	right
A	er we went into
B	oh did they?
B	yes you can
A	er
B	erm we'll keep
A	yes yes yes
B	erm
A	mm
B	and the
A	so erm we went round the summer palace which was
B	beautiful lantern there
A	yeah yeah lanterns
B	I always think concubines it always makes me think of porcupines
B	what was your hotel like?
A	hotel erm it was quite pleasant it was er a very central
B	and the people who were getting married were they all Chinese?
A	yeah yes all Chinese very
B	yeah
A	and the the poor peasant farmer who erm comprises the most population so so the Chinese government whatever you
B	right
A	so er they have er so when it comes to erm
B	yeah
A	it it is it is quite a thought and it and when they when you think that erm they they're not very good on their human rights record is is is not very good at all but then erm their the history of China
A	which we in Europe have never heard of er er er and and and it's been really really brutal and
B	no no
A	erm if
B	right
A	so so it you know? and I think erm it it might be in the erm er Chinese er psyche
B	mm
A	er
B	yes yes
A	and then they had a picture of this big church that had been erm where the people of this local I dunno town had grouped gathered together and built a big church erm erm a christian church
B	right
A	erm and there was pictures of the congregation erm
B	mm
A	and and and on one side the Chinese are are being very supportive of erm different religions and different groups
B	yes
A	but erm there was one chap
B	oh no
A	and they they completely erm they
B	raised it to the ground did they?
A	well they didn't raise it to the ground but they broke it so that the whole roof had collapsed everything had collapsed so it couldn't be used and and er so so the these Chinese people are very erm
B	yeah
A	erm so yeah so it was quite quite quite something
B	I mean what what would happen in our country if we we've had a lot of trouble with erm
A	mm
B	hate and
A	mm
B	what would happen if we went and pulled down their
A	I know and the the things they
B	yeah we're very tolerant in this country I mean at the moment erm
A	mm
B	IE everyone was talking in a foreign language
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	but there you go that's how the world is now erm but you know a lot of places wouldn't tolerate that I mean Hungary doesn't tolerate it
A	mm
B	and in in a way erm
A	mm
B	because we're going to use lose our our language as it stands now is going to be lost completely it's gonna go erm because all these other languages coming in are going to completely change it
A	mm
B	erm so I just wanted to say that we did find it rather disconcerting
A	mm on the other hand you see in China that that if if if any group you know gets gets looks like it's getting the upper hand it it's it's suppressed
B	oh yes
A	eventually
B	yeah
A	but he said just look
B	right
A	so so erm
B	I can see what you're saying I mean it would be an absolutely enormous problem and then
A	mm
B	what would we do? erm but then you know we're only a small country England and we're not responsible for the erm problems of all these
A	no
B	enormous countries that have got plenty of space they may not have the resources there to maintain people but they have plenty of space there for people to grow food surely and to but and to make
A	well
B	whereas we haven't got
A	mm
B	we're tiny if you look at the globe and you look at England in relation to all these other places
A	mm
B	we're just tiny
A	mm
B	absolutely tiny so the fact that erm more and people are coming here and they're
A	mm
B	our customs they're diluting our food
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm yeah
B	it's always got to be something fancy it's gotta be something from India or it's gotta be from Italy
A	mm
B	erm or something you know erm
A	mm
B	German food is is erm
A	mm
B	a lot of vegetables
A	mm mm
B	and in the old days nobody could afford very much meat
A	mm
B	so it was potatoes and and vegetables
A	mm
B	and that's what people had and that's very healthy
A	mm mm
B	right
A	and so erm
A	yeah
B	and by converting it into erm powder powdered milk
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but just
B	let's have a look at that describe that photograph to me
A	well one of the things that really hit me and erm I don't know hit hit other people but the the number of tall buildings er er that that have been built because people are flooding into into the big cities erm you've got a city such as erm
B	right
A	erm Beijing I think is around twenty-five
B	right
A	something it's it's you know
B	yeah
A	so they they they lived three they live on the forty-seventh floor of
B	good lord
A	of a building but you see in Shanghai they
B	yeah
A	they've got six thousand of those
B	right
A	so you you if you just imagine
B	yeah
A	er or more er yeah and
B	oh yes I can see
A	you can just see er
B	yeah the student riots
A	er the the
A	er yeah there's
B	right
A	erm erm
B	yeah
A	but in China most of the flowers are in flower pots
B	oh are they?
A	so so you have this great big square where where the
B	mm
A	of the er er military
B	mm
A	and you also you know and and the there there there are some very ornate let me see if I can find oh yes that one see that one?
B	oh it's beautiful isn't it?
A	isn't it? yeah and you've got that and then you've got all the flowers all the way round and they're all pots so the idea of course is that you know one day you can have that and then if there happens to be a big erm a big
B	festival
A	a bigger festival a big event move all those to one side and rearrange them
B	yeah and so
A	yeah
B	or half as tall as Nelson's Column so if you're looking at that and the flowers in there are enormous did you find out what they were made of?
A	I
B	proper flowers yeah
A	proper flowers
B	yeah
A	the ones up there I
B	yeah silk or paper couldn't they?
A	or paper yeah yeah
B	it's beautiful
A	yeah yeah and and then they had erm
B	yeah
A	it's it's quite quite something oh it's
B	mm
A	I think he died in seventy-six and then the chap who succeeded him
B	yes
B	oh right yeah
A	and so that's what he did and he he erm
B	oh right
A	and er and normally in any government that would've been a er the government would've been toppled erm but he erm he er
B	mm mm
A	and making sure people were technically qualified and all that stuff
B	mm mm
A	and have have used that as as one of the
A	sorry
B	alright we just dropped the tape recorder but that's alright pop it there
B	mm
A	erm employment er when they retire whereas that was never the case before
B	no no
A	so this is the first time for that
B	mm mm
A	and there's a
B	mm
A	erm
B	I mean they're allowed to have two children now as well aren't they? just recently that that rule has been changed
A	yes
B	mm
A	er but you might've seen on the news the other night that because
B	right
A	so people are living longer
B	who's got to look after all of them
A	all of them yes
B	crikey
A	so so the the impact of that
B	no
A	but they need
B	mm
A	it's it's really it's really bizarre
B	I mean in the days of chairman chairman Mao if he sent everybody out to a cooperative to work
A	mm
B	he sent them all off to a cooperative to work they must've had a terrific sort of brain drain
A	mm
B	within the central nucleus of
A	yeah absolutely
B	so they were well they were lacking in in
A	who is who
B	yeah yeah
A	that's er that's another
B	that's another one of those huge
A	yeah yeah
B	ceramic flower baskets
A	you see
B	oh right
A	yeah look at that see
B	yeah
A	so
B	well that must be a very economical way of doing it
A	yeah
B	because erm in in
A	mm
B	but if they
A	mm
B	and watered and fertilised they can bring them out next year can't they?
A	mm mm mm
B	what's the name of that place can you remember?
A	er it's the Forbidden City
B	right
A	erm I think is the is the place there
B	right
A	where the last emperor was
B	mm
A	of being being governed by an emperor
B	mm
A	who was so detached from the people erm that he was he was kinda given the boot
B	mm
A	er for the deadly rivals the biggest rivals to China Japan
B	mm
A	Japan is
B	right
A	and then he came back and erm and
B	right
A	he they made him into a gardener and he wrote a
B	good heavens
A	and he wrote a book and in fact there's a film
B	mm mm
A	erm I went I went to see it years well probably about twenty years ago it was called The Last Emperor and I think it was by a famous
B	oh yes
A	er director it can't remember it got a lot erm
B	right
A	erm how he grew up in you know the
B	luxury yeah
A	but ended his life as a gardener he wrote his book and he said he was never
A	and
B	well that says a lot doesn't it?
A	yeah yeah that says a lot and I I think erm but er
B	mm
A	but what they say is that most of the
B	oh right
A	and erm on board our our our our cruise ship there was a erm a chap who erm purportedly was related to er the the erm the emperor's family
B	mm
A	er and now he's a
B	right
A	wares etcetera but he he was quite a good artist actually erm but clearly that was much more acceptable than erm you know any kind of revolutionary
B	I was gonna say
A	activity erm
B	mm
A	a lot of them you see how people used to live and
B	mm
A	in in these in these places erm
B	mm
A	er put to this but bear in mind erm it's
B	mm
A	they probably it probably doesn't cost them as much to do this as but still there's a lot of skill
B	mm
A	to to er refurbish and everything erm
B	so they're not so
A	but they but the inside
B	not so ornate
A	they
B	yeah
A	it it strikes me as they they haven't got the sort of creature comforts as you have in a say National Trust property but that might be because of the erm erm
B	well
A	very minimalist
B	yes
A	mm
B	erm they would have lots and lots of lowly people bringing in food and things to them wouldn't they?
A	yeah yeah
B	rather than actually
A	yeah
B	you could see this stove and where they were cooking and all that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	thrones
A	er thrones there
B	oh yeah
A	and you you you you you you feel there must've been er tables chairs
B	yeah
A	and those are the things that over the
A	the Red Army for example did erm
B	yeah
A	er because they they saw it as erm
B	how many people were in your party?
A	er thirty-nine
B	oh it's a big crowd isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	they were all alright?
A	yeah a very good group actually
B	yeah
A	very good group very very good group
B	mm
A	er when I say local shop it was a shopping centre
B	yeah
A	and erm and outside were these trees
B	oh aren't they beautiful?
A	but
B	oh are they?
A	yes
B	they're permanently in autumn colours then
A	yeah yeah
B	ah
A	yes
B	yeah
B	right
A	and and I felt slightly under dressed
B	oh dear
A	er but er but the erm but they had the the the the quality of the erm shoes and the the the jewellery and everything like that was really really really good
B	yeah
A	you know? so erm
B	well
A	oh we
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	and erm it was like that in there
A	mm
B	I I looked in and there was a small head scarf
A	yeah
B	and it was nearly two hundred pounds
A	yes yeah
B	a
A	yeah
B	if you wanted to take home a little erm
A	no no no no no
B	oh really?
A	and it was about the history of how the erm the
B	yes
A	and and fighting and how that
B	yeah
A	how you could
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	what's that?
B	oh right
A	erm
B	huge
A	or or no a tortoise tortoise tortoise
B	we're looking at
A	tortoise I I think it might be tortoise a stone stone stone
B	stone stone tortoise huge
A	I think it's
B	man
A	yeah and and above that is the er I think it's the one of the key
B	right
A	it's probably about fifteen hundred
B	looking at an avenue of trees now
A	yeah it's like with with the
B	oh I see
A	on on on either side
B	it's a sculpture park yes
A	there's
B	I see
A	and the the all the tombs of the emperors that are called I can't remember what they're called erm
B	mm
A	Valley Of The Emperors or something but
B	yeah
A	it all the
B	right
A	and there's there's
B	mm
A	all the animals represent different things
B	yes
A	how we doing for time are we?
B	well we're alright we've erm if we could go on for another few minutes we'll reach an hour so
A	okay
B	won't be too bad today
A	so I'll I'll just quickly flash through these
B	so erm oh there's a new group of canoers back now
A	yeah
B	my goodness
A	this is when we went to the Great Wall
B	right
A	and we went along the wall
B	yes
A	very very steep in places but we we did a
B	mm
A	morning
B	oh gosh it is steep
A	er yeah
B	yes
A	er but but in where erm where the tourists go they've put erm er what you call it? erm
B	railings
A	railings there
B	oh right yes
A	er where they they have all the big
B	yes
A	er events
B	right looks very nice
A	er yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and this is the ceiling
B	right
A	and it and and it and this
B	right
A	so they're the lights are changing all the time it's quite quite
B	mm mm
A	and they haven't got space erm to do activities
B	yeah
A	a lot of the activities are done
B	parks and public space yeah
B	they're doing tai chi
A	tai tai chi or
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and and they it it's
B	oh right
A	in a in a video but it's it was quite something
B	yeah some beautiful colours
A	yeah they're it's all you know it's all electronic and all that sort of thing but the statues here that they've created are are very artistic and erm they're very erm then we went to erm a water
B	right
A	where basically you have lots of erm waterfalls
B	yes
A	water jets and changing colour and then they have music to go with the
B	oh lovely
A	it's really quite quite impressive you know it's erm
B	was there evening entertainments you had to
A	er that was there you just
B	mm
A	turned it we
B	right
A	dropped us off and then we just erm er yeah it's it's
B	right
A	but the the security people just didn't want them to do that
B	no
A	cos I imagine it's health and safety as well actually
B	yeah
A	quite
B	oh you can stand in a terracotta army uniform and have your photograph taken
B	that's amazing
A	yeah I didn't think I I perhaps er
B	mm
A	it was basically erm how er you could you could how the terracotta army people were made
B	yes
A	and and what you realise is just how much skill
B	yeah
A	goes into just making one terracotta army
B	yeah
A	and then of course you've got the the terracotta army this is the ovens that they they use
B	yeah
A	the heads
B	oh yes
A	were these
B	oh yes
A	and what what they found is is when they've dug
B	yes
A	thought before and then and then there's the terracotta army people
B	it's incredible that every
A	mm
B	single face on the terracotta army is different isn't it?
A	yes yes
B	the
A	it
B	work that went into it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then you had the central control place
B	yeah
A	er so you the command and control where the generals were it was it was a complete army underground er which you probably read about but erm he also erm for his
B	yeah
A	so he he buried them alive underneath
B	oh dear
A	yeah yeah yeah so erm
B	that must've been terrifying can you imagine the night before you knew you were going to be buried alive?
A	it
B	yeah
A	so so erm
B	right right
A	but but the
B	right
A	of the whole thing
B	right
A	so what they're saying is is erm
B	yeah
A	and and and and
B	yeah
A	so erm er you can see all these
B	oh right
A	because they have big wooden things
B	right
A	but as they've opened things the oxygen's got in and the whole thing's collapsed so
B	right
A	so the what they're doing and and maybe it's maybe a cost
B	right
A	control thing is they're waiting until erm the technology is there and then they'll open it up and these are erm
B	so we're looking at a picture of?
A	of of a erm this might be
B	it's a horse?
A	yeah a horse and I'm not sure whether he's a
B	yeah
A	erm but a warrior
B	yes
A	erm and I think this might be all in bronze
B	yeah
A	erm but the
B	mm mm
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	yes
A	so as soon as he was about five or six years old
B	yeah
A	he he
B	right
A	so the reason why the terracotta army was there
B	yeah
A	the pits and everything like that
B	oh I see
A	erm
B	right
A	whereas if he left it till he was you know near his end of his life
B	mm mm
A	wouldn't be thinking about the previous emperor
B	no of course not no
A	he'd be he'd be spending his money on the
B	yes
A	oh his
B	yeah
A	erm but there's thousands of arrowheads and oh I mean it's just it's just erm
B	so would you like to bring it to a close now?
A	yes yeah I'll bring it to a close
B	oh wonderful
A	er
B	with four horses
A	four horses yeah it's it's just just er it's just
B	goes on and on
A	yeah it's it's just such a big big erm
B	well thank you very much for telling me all about that today
A	okay
B	and we're one hour four minutes and twenty seconds
A	good
B	so
