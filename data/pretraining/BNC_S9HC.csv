A	it's a
B	mm
A	so where's their where's Maddox and that lot where's their report?
B	well they they've said they it's not necessary
A	mm
B	ideally you want
A	exactly
B	it puts cost on them
A	mm
B	that's was the because they're what we had opted for the turbines think of as many ways as you can and ducking and diving
A	yeah
B	and think of as many things as you can to put cost on
A	mm
B	and that's when we brought the heritage expert out of the top hat
A	absolutely
A	yeah you're getting very
A	what have I got to do?
B	well
A	oh got it on
B	oh god well I were er we should have seen pressing buttons won't we?
A	right it's not really it's not really
A	so where were we?
B	yeah well we we were kicking the can down the road
A	yeah
B	as quickly as we could
A	mm
B	but I would think the
A	mm
B	seek more information
A	but that would be the ideal thing
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	the worst the worst outcome is if they approve it but I can't see that
A	right
B	so they either reject it or defer it
A	are we all going? are we the three of us going? we are?
B	I would think so
A	mm
B	half past six
A	mm
B	ours was at
A	I think there's a possibility that it's six o'clock
B	oh
A	just but I
B	mm
A	stick in my mind more than six thirty
B	but the other thing that's concerning me is er
A	mm
B	in fact I went round her house
A	so how much notice would she need? if she agreed to
A	oh they have?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but what we don't know is whether anybody at
A	mm
B	and that's where
A	yeah
B	she was
A	but if er
A	so they haven't got anybody
B	the parish
A	but they they might
A	oh right okay
B	has got three minutes objectors
A	okay got you
B	right?
A	got you
B	and if there's a lot of objectors
A	yeah
B	the three minutes is split
A	right
B	so they've really gotta get their act together and just get one speaking
A	well I think they want one don't they? this erm
B	yeah
A	this
B	yeah unless you get the professional that
A	yeah well that's what you suggested
B	cos I don't believe the planning committee will
A	mm mm
B	have to stick on the facts because if they don't these developers are quite clever
A	yeah
B	and they'll appeal it and judicial review it and oh god
A	but that again
B	yeah that's right that's what it's all about
A	yeah
B	in my opinion
B	who? yes
A	she she will? mm
B	yeah there's there's gotta be the the case officer there
A	mm
B	and my little friend
B	erm yeah and the legal guy
A	mm
B	or woman
A	oh right
B	er remember that
A	yeah
B	legal woman
A	yeah yeah
B	that was er
A	yeah
B	at ours on the
A	yes I yes yeah
B	that I got hold of the following day and
A	yeah
B	said you're completely out of order went full scale said there wasn't a
A	mm
B	and there was
A	mm
A	yeah
B	well I don't know I I said to I emailed
A	no
B	I just said to him look
A	but he hasn't nothing's come out has it that
B	no
A	no
B	no
A	so some of them will be going to the
B	well
A	to the town hall
B	that I don't know
A	mm mm
B	well it
A	well we're not going to the town hall
B	it's gonna be a bit embarrassing if they all turn up at the town hall innit?
A	mm
B	with their banners
B	oh I dunno
A	I think it might be six but I'm not sure about that but er
B	I'll check it when I get home
A	yeah
B	it's number two on the list
A	oh right okay
B	I've checked that
A	oh
B	but er but there is an agenda and that one's item number two
A	oh
B	yeah
A	and then we've got to work out the car parking system
B	yeah
A	mm
A	they give you a secret number don't they? er it changes every day
B	yeah so they they put the number up at the start of the meeting
A	yeah
B	so any thief that's in there can
A	but going back to this erm this entertainment we're going to have you decided on a day
B	it's on Saturday
A	it's on Saturday we're going right
B	yeah I saw er
A	okay
B	seen
A	right
B	cos er she didn't
A	oh right okay
B	and I shot round there today but
A	yeah
B	blood test and he's gotta see a consultant tomorrow and then he's gotta have his chemo on
A	oh right okay
B	so yeah
A	so the Saturday I cos I came in after you were talking about that
B	yeah that's right
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	for the two days before the chemo and then two or three days afterwards
A	mm
B	yeah well he stood up to it better than
A	mm when did you last see him?
B	this morning
A	how does he look?
B	a bit pale
A	a bit pale? mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm but he seems to have stood up to it better than
A	yeah
B	quite a lot people I know who've had chemo
A	right
B	and I know my niece was knocked around all over the place with her chemo
A	mm yeah
B	cor
A	mm I don't know if he's well he's he doesn't carry much weight does he? he's not he's not
B	no
A	thickset or anything so
B	no
A	maybe he's quite fit in some ways
B	no
A	no
B	just watches rugby is his lot
A	oh
B	but he's quite
A	yeah
B	about it all probably more positive than
A	he always looks very dapper
B	yeah
A	I thought he looked very dapper at the erm
B	mm
A	he
B	yeah
A	he looked just just the part I thought he looked like the manager
A	like a theatre manager
B	yeah but he's er
A	mm
B	like I say
A	no
B	twelve months ago but then you wouldn't expect him to
A	no
B	I don't suppose
A	I noticed that as well
B	it's not
A	oh it's er
B	I think it
A	what's his name?
A	yeah
B	erm er that's up for sale
A	yeah I never see him I wouldn't
B	no I don't
A	I wouldn't
B	no I erm
A	yeah
B	a few of the er hearings
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm sure he was
A	yeah
A	so maybe he's going erm I dunno maybe he's going back to South Africa cos he's South African
B	I I thought he'd he's also got a house in erm
A	really?
B	he built these two
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so they just that was just lies?
B	yeah and then it wasn't the sort of granny flat that I think people envisaged
A	mm
B	because then old
A	mm
B	like a four bedroomed half a million quid kick
A	and how much too high was it because er
B	it was
A	our our neighbour
B	that's right
A	mm
B	well it was too high
A	it was too high yeah
B	yeah that's right but as is the want of our district council they got away with it
A	mm
B	in the same way as the got away with er New England Lodge up there
A	mm
B	beyond the planning application in terms of square footage floor area and in terms of height
A	but we've come to
B	that's right oh yeah
A	to its erm
B	that's right
A	I dunno to its blooming big envelope
A	so what's the latest for that with the erm
B	it's still up for sale
A	mm
B	and still the argument going on on access and all this sort of thing
A	and the the he's dropped quite a bit on the price
B	mm he's
A	cos I remember it falling
B	down six fifty now
A	six fifty as opposed to
B	but it's it's stuffed er
A	really?
B	yeah
A	well that's been on on the market for ages now hasn't it?
B	yeah well I saw
A	right
B	and I so when you were away I saw him on
A	mm
B	when are you going? and he said well I don't know
A	so does it
B	yeah around the lodge
A	or up the it's in dispute as to who can
B	yeah
A	use it mm
B	that's right
A	and how much you can use it
B	the easements that's right easements and all this sort of thing
A	oh right
B	so it's not just
A	mm
B	it's
A	I didn't realise it was
B	yeah and er
A	mm
B	to allow
A	mm
B	and it ain't sorted out
A	so it's
B	so
A	so he's got a buyer lined up but it they're not going
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah and he's got a place in
A	mm
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	but er
A	a bit more remote there isn't it?
B	mm
A	it's er
B	no he was a bit he was a bit dejected the other morning
A	was he?
B	so
A	did I do you know about
B	has he?
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	he got quite a good price for it
B	right
A	and er
B	so he's bought four in Belfast now?
A	well it's a bit like that the plan is for him to buy a house
B	oh yeah
A	for the price of one
B	yeah
A	there's erm
B	six hundred five hundred or six hundred
A	so and and they're gonna buy that together my understanding and
B	yeah
A	it's alright as long as he's in Belfast
B	yeah and until Inland Revenue crack down on it
A	mm
B	but erm
A	yeah but
B	in the meantime
A	but if he's got the house I mean that's quite a lot of equity isn't it really
B	mm
A	so you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	and there's gonna be a big move in a couple of weeks and we've I think the plan is for
B	to where where would you go from Holyhead or
A	I think he probably
B	Stranraer?
A	well he's
B	right
A	cos he bought the car over at one stage
B	yeah
A	erm
B	cos it's either Holyhead or Stranraer isn't it?
A	is that when he came back for the wedding that he came that way? yes it was no I think they came by oh cos he wanted to take his car back so they came over by air for the wedding
B	mm
A	and then they took the car from here
B	right
A	and then er they went over on the ferry to
B	yeah
A	and then it's two hours I think from Dublin to
B	yeah
A	Belfast
B	yeah that's probably about right
A	anyway so I was discussing it with him last night and I think what we'll
B	you'd better check the insurance on the van too
A	I know it's gotta er you've got to look into this because
B	mm
A	especially if there's gonna be potentially three drivers
B	and if you're going through Republic of Ireland
A	yeah
B	they might er
A	yeah we need to do all this
B	yeah
A	beforehand
B	sure
A	before before yeah it's a foreign country isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah unless it is a there must be from Liverpool can you go to Belfast?
B	erm well you can in the summer
A	mm
B	er you can go I think
A	mm
B	Stranraer
A	well Stranraer's a long way to go
B	anyway
A	is it?
B	well Ardrossan's quite a bit higher up than Stranraer
A	oh I dunno where it is though what about Liverpool?
B	I'm not aware of the Liverpool Belfast ferries
A	I think there is one
B	is there?
A	mm
B	oh there used to be Heysham as
A	the Isle of Man
B	yeah
A	from Liverpool
B	mm
A	maybe
B	no
A	mm
B	I don't think so and there's Heysham up at Morecambe that used to do it but that's only a summer thing I think
A	mm
B	oh right
A	few days away
A	well he's been into it it's well I dunno if he's I think once you're into containers that's quite expensive isn't it?
B	dunno
A	I I dunno
B	mm
A	so
B	well they'd bring the container to the door
A	oh right
B	in the price
A	so it's a small container it's not one of these
B	mm
A	bit things with Maersk on
B	no
A	mm
B	mm
A	well I'll have to look into that
B	mm
