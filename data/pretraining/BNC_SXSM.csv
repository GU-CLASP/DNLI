A	and then I would have to pay back
B	mm
A	like all of it
B	yeah
A	they expect all of it back
B	but the thing is if you're in overdraft you can't pay it back like literally you have no money
A	no no I literally can't so what they'd have to do is they'd have to do what I did last year when I didn't have enough money and they just take it out of the bank like five pounds a month or something
B	really?
A	to pay off last year's money and I can't ask her to do it again
B	mm
A	she can't afford it like
B	no
A	she's skint you know? we're not in a good financial situation to deal with this
B	but you're not horrendous
A	but I would have to get a job
B	they're horrendous
A	I know
B	but yeah
A	I would have to get a job there'd be no alternative I couldn't like you know get all upset and anxious about it I would have to do it
B	god it sucks doesn't it student finance?
A	yes it really does
B	why can't you just leave uni if you it's not for you and just?
A	why can't you pay it back in twenty years
B	yeah
A	when everyone else pays it back
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	cos you still you'd still pay for it technically
A	that's yeah yeah I'm still gonna have to pay for it I'm this isn't even like like cos some of the money you do pay back in twenty years whenever when you have enough money so there's that as well from
B	mm
A	I have to pay back later so it's not
B	mm
A	more than that
B	accommodation
A	mm
B	so
A	no I wouldn't hang about if I was gonna leave I wouldn't leave it until after Christmas
B	mm
A	I know that like this is all hypothetical by the way like I'm not I'm just I just worry about all the implications
B	all
A	of it like
B	yeah yeah
A	whether I or not I am thinking about leaving or not cos I
B	you just think of all the options
A	you know I still am a bit but I'm also wanting to you know
A	you don't have to try and be helpful
B	no no
B	I'm not even trying I just thought of it
A	yeah I know
B	it's not like a legacy you're not gonna be coming to like yeah I have to come back here ever after university you probably won't
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah I did think last night like would it really be terrible if I just stayed for three years and didn't enjoy myself and always struggled with the work but eventually did it after like a few extensions each time or whatever? cos I'd still have like people who are nice to
B	well you being here
B	you have a chance to kind of cocoon yourself a bit you know?
A	exactly
B	like and you can learn skills but also not push yourself too far kind of thing
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	like I know I'm saying I'm having a horrible time but it's it's honestly just the academic side like not the
B	just the academic
B	we're just
B	boarding school students basically
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	because when
A	yeah
B	you're just yeah
A	absolutely
B	that's the thing
B	they expect like this transformation like
A	and
B	right you've messed this up
A	yeah
B	why don't you get a job?
A	I know
B	and it's like it's not that simple
A	it's just like my family had no idea how how mentally ill the the entire thing had made me you know I just couldn't cope with any of it and it it just must have looked like such an excuse like
B	yeah to somebody
A	from their perspective
B	that doesn't understand
A	yeah
B	what it can make you feel
A	it must like to my mum I must just have just looked like an absolutely lazy sod like I just wouldn't get out of bed I wouldn't do anything I would say I couldn't get a job and you know it was just horrible
B	yeah yeah it's like easing you into the harsh realities
A	yeah the harsh realities yeah
B	because
A	when you're at university
B	it is gonna happen
A	but you don't have to pay for you don't have to pay for like doctors things like prescriptions and you don't have to
B	uhu
A	you you just get to live in this bubble
B	we do we do
A	for three years
B	it's a good life Hazel Grace sorry
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah it's gotten longer and again and you've started like putting it to the side
B	yeah
A	no you could get it shorter that would look really cool
B	like I had it
A	mm
B	before
A	yeah like chin length
B	yeah
A	that was nice
B	it was cool
A	looks really cool
A	mm
B	and that's what that's what I did
A	yeah me too actually like I had a bob when I was about erm
B	yeah
A	and I grew it out
B	yeah
A	for like three years and then last year when I got back I was like no cutting my hair off don't care and I loved it like it was so good it did actually look really nice for a while like when I made an effort with it
B	mm
A	but then sometimes because my hair's so thick and big it made it look a bit like triangular at the same time
A	like yours is easier cos it's like it's a little bit thinner
B	mm
A	so you can
B	yeah
A	do more with it
B	I'd rather have thick hair to be honest like
A	oh no I dunno it's not that great I mean it's not it's not even that thick like my auntie says it's like fine hair but it's also thick so it like it's not wiry it's just sort of
B	voluminous
A	yeah
B	getting a haircut can actually make you feel better
A	it can but then all that work
A	over this year trying to grow it again just to get it cut
B	oh did you consciously try and grow it out?
A	yeah I am this is what I'm doing now I'm growing it out like from cos at the beginning of the year it was like up here
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	it was it was about chin length actually at one point
B	did you decide you didn't like it or did you just want a change?
A	no I just felt like I'd had it short for like I dunno about half a year so I
B	mm
A	kind of went yeah
B	mm
A	and that's the thing like when you get
B	yeah
A	vice versa
B	yeah
A	like when it gets longer like this it's like oh my hair was so cool and styled and nice and it's just the middle bit when it's like nothing and you
B	mm
A	just have to wait for it to grow
B	mm
A	into something you like
B	it's not dull your hair's a lovely colour
A	but it used to be so much nicer than this it used to be like gold
B	ageing
A	mm yeah
B	I'd call it pretty golden now to be honest like
A	mm
B	green
B	so negative about life
A	oh
B	we're in the north we're meant to be cheerful
A	I know
B	oh you don't have to give it me back
B	ah thank you
A	I really enjoyed that taxi trip cos it was free
B	I was like yeah it's free free taxi
B	I just it was nice I wish they'd told us from the beginning it was free because it
A	I know
B	would be nice to sit in a taxi and just not have to watch the pay meter
A	I know
A	no I only wanna go twice a week cos I went on Monday and I was gonna go shopping on Monday and then I just came home cos I was so disgusted
B	oh my god how is that even possible? seventy-three people like my picture of me in the
B	so famous lol
B	I think it's only because I have a a lot of people in my school a lot of people at my old university that I've got
A	have you?
B	on Facebook
A	yeah
B	a lot of people well actually not that many people here surprisingly
A	you have friends
B	I do have friends but surprisingly I've got
A	mm
B	like apart from you lot you
A	mm
B	like I don't feel like I've got enough friends here that
A	oh
B	or as many that I thought I'd have
A	oh
B	well not it's not
A	in your groups and stuff
B	I just spent time with
A	yeah
B	like with and it was just like we all kind of knew each other and here it's like a lot more segmented if that's a word
A	the word
B	segmented
A	mm
B	thinking about too much whether I am happy here
A	well I don't know you don't have to be happy though I don't think I mean you don't have to
B	yeah I feel like I'm coping
A	yeah
B	I've not had any breakdowns like did at my old uni which is good like I used to
A	oh
B	and I I kind of had like I don't know if it's fair on people to call them panic attacks but I think they probably were because I just couldn't like I was
A	why is it unfair
B	gasping
A	on people?
B	well I dunno like some people say they they literally feel like they're going to die and I didn't I just felt like
A	no that's just like
B	I was gasping
A	oh but I think you can get is it you can get er anxiety attacks and panic attacks or are they the same thing?
B	I thought they were the same but
B	maybe they are different
A	but like a panic attack can for some people mean like yeah you feel like you're about to die and it feels like really you know your your body's just reacting really badly to something but also
B	mm
A	it can just be like really heavy breathing and
B	yeah
A	feeling quite
B	yeah
A	like not in control of the way you're you're kind of acting and I think that counts
B	that's good then
A	yeah
A	it's a valid panic attack or anxiety attack
B	were they not real panic attacks?
A	they weren't real panic attacks she was just really like that bless her
B	ah
A	she's a nice girl but she was very dramatic
B	was it just like a phrase she used like it's a panic attack or would she actually did she actually
A	she
B	believe it was a panic attack?
A	she did believe like she would get really over over-the-top about it like she would breathe like a dying llama and it was just like you're not you I know you're making this up
A	but it's okay like I get what you're doing here it's fine
B	oh god
A	it's just like bless you like you're so adorable and she's so cute she's like five foot no she's like four foot nine or something
B	oh my god
A	she is like a little thing you can put in your pocket
B	that's so cute
A	I've known her since nursery which is weird and I always
B	was she always short?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	and I remember like we became friends like later on but I remember she said to me in nursery like erm you bullied me at nursery
A	and I was like oh god did I? I'm so sorry apparently I called her
A	but not like in the sense of like oh you're so like scared of that like chicken you know
B	you just called her chicken
A	I just called her chicken like as in the animal
B	that's really cute
A	or or the meat? I'm not really sure which
B	oh my god
A	so I wasn't that bad I think
B	I locked me and this girl didn't get on in er reception so
A	mm
B	so she came round to our house and we didn't get on I didn't get on with this girl so I locked her in my wardrobe
B	and put a chair against it
A	oh my god
B	and sat like down
A	you psychopath
B	I wasn't but she
B	well as a little kid she
A	was she?
B	she said like all sorts of stuff to me like she was just like really mean so I just sat
B	and locked her in a cupboard cos I didn't know what else to do
A	I am kind of glad like I don't have a great memory of my childhood but I am glad that I didn't do anything that's like
B	you didn't kill anybody
A	outright strange like I wasn't that weird you know I
B	that's good
A	kill like a pet or I didn't feel happy about someone
B	dying
A	dying
B	yeah
A	or something like that
B	you didn't have any disturbing images
A	cos I know some people do like
B	yeah
A	some kids
B	some people
A	have weird things going on
B	oh
A	I think the worst thing I did was just lie a lot
B	yeah me too
A	mm
B	you sort of grow out it
A	yeah
B	things from
A	things from like
B	yeah
A	getting worse than they need to be
B	yeah I think you you lie for different reasons when you're older
A	yeah
B	when you're younger you kind of lie to show off
A	yeah
B	and when you're older if you lie it's to try er escape things
A	yeah exactly
B	which you kind of use it in a different sense so it's not
A	necessary
B	yeah there we go
A	I can't stand to look at my shoes any longer I need to clean them they're so muddy
B	oh
A	oh the
B	gosh god that's the thing about living round here with all the grass you just get they get
A	I know
B	covered in dirt shoes
A	I know at least that's dried mud so it's it's not like getting it all over the carpet sort of thing
B	oh
A	it was like week three or four probably?
B	my god that was like a month ago nearly
A	mm yeah it was
B	wow
A	god it feels like a lifetime ago freshers' week doesn't it?
B	it really does it's only been like six weeks but it feels like a long time ago to me
A	like half a year potentially
B	mm it really does
A	I just don't like it when my shoes are dirty they have to be pristine
B	yeah same
B	I always really annoys me I
A	mm
B	try and do it in the shower
A	oh that's a good idea
B	yeah but sometimes they get too wet to wear and I have to leave them for a few days
A	I'll never get the mud out of this bit
B	you will just put them in the sink
A	might have to do that yeah
B	no no I'm I'm cool chilling here to be honest I'm just on my phone
A	oh
B	in like
A	nine?
B	half an yeah like half an hour
A	okay
B	forty minutes you can watch it in my room if you want
A	yeah
B	put some cushions in there and stuff
A	mm
B	and I heard my cat in the background
A	ah bet he was concerned about you
B	but quite funny because
A	ah
B	it's like you understand my pain
A	that's cute
B	he was like meow
B	and I have and it's crazy
A	has it been a month since you went home?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean the thing is like er people don't understand how much my little kitty means to me like
A	no
B	he came to me at a time of my life when I was very depressed
A	ah
B	he came on the day that I got my medication
A	really?
B	for the first time
A	ah
B	like he just turned up and I just think it was I don't believe in fate
A	it was fate
B	but
A	well it was fate
B	it was fate that he came
B	and he made me
A	yeah they really pets really do have a huge impact I think
B	mm yeah definitely like sometimes instead of lying in my bed I'd just come downstairs mm to my conservatory and just lie on the rug and the cat would just
A	yeah
B	lie
A	well see if like
B	and just snuggle up
A	you were living on your own and you were like really depressed but you had a pet
B	yeah
A	like an obligation to like you know walk them or
B	you'd have a purpose
B	kind of
A	something to get you out of bed
B	yeah
A	you know like cos you you'd love them so much that you wouldn't wanna neglect them like that so it's
A	I think they're really helpful
B	definitely
A	for depressed people
B	yes
A	in hospitals instead of instead of medication just give them a cat or a dog
B	ah
B	like here have a free pet
A	I know exactly like there are so many like stray animals and things that get taken in and
B	they look clean to me
A	cos sometimes they look like that cos
B	they look very shiny the
A	the mud like comes back after you've got them wet
B	mm occasionally but they look clean to me
A	yeah
B	ah
A	watching over me
B	making sure that you're
A	the northern life yeah
B	no I bet you you'll never be northern you're you you're just like
A	no
B	a Cornwall person through and through
A	it's weird really cos I don't have many Cornish attributes like I don't surf I don't even swim
B	no you don't you don't swim
A	I don't
B	you're like the opposite of a
A	yeah pretty much I don't really speak in a Cornish accent anymore
B	see I love surfing I like fish
A	should swap places
B	we should
B	mind you you would not what what what do northern people do?
A	erm I dunno you eat Greggs and
B	they like chips and gravy but I think
A	yeah
B	they like that in everywhere
A	too stodgy for me though like I used to like chips
B	I love gravy and chips
A	but I don't I have gone off it a bit
B	erm
A	oh this is such a workout
B	are roast dinners at southern thing? or are they more of a?
A	er I dunno I have them every weekend so probably
B	oh okay
A	I dunno if you do up here
B	well I dunno like
A	I think maybe it's just a family thing rather than a
B	yeah
A	location thing
B	yeah
A	like roasts are just sort of like inherently British anyway so
B	I mean everyone up where I have like has various things but like it's like everyone's really big on like greasy café food like
A	yeah
B	egg and chips stuff like that
A	yeah
B	but not where not where I live but typically northern
A	yeah
B	is that
A	that might explain my dad then
B	yeah
A	yes
B	oh right cool
A	oh it's so annoying get out
B	it's gonna be weird sleeping in my bed
A	yeah
B	wow
A	really? god I could never get used to that thing I hate it
B	I still prefer my
A	have you got a double bed?
B	no but it's nicer
A	yeah
B	it's a nicer bed and it's I can sleep so much easier in the bed that I've got at home like I
A	yeah
B	fall asleep quicker and it's weird
A	yeah so do I at home just like yeah that's true actually maybe that's why I've been sleeping so badly
B	I slept badly at my last uni as well
A	yeah
B	and I thought it was because of the bed partly but
A	cos my bed at home is so comfortable like and I have so many pillows and it's literally it fills my room it's that big
B	mm
A	like my room's like a box room and you can just about fit a double bed in there
B	oh awesome
A	and it's just it's the most comfortable bed in the world it's amazing
B	really?
A	to make it comfy
B	princess and the pea
A	I know we were weren't we?
B	this morning
A	like it just feels like like it just feels like it was yesterday
B	yeah but it was actually three o'clock this morning
A	yeah I think it was
B	it was
B	I was in pain because I thought that if they'd I'd laughed they think I wasn't in pain but I was
B	but you were making me laugh because
A	I wasn't really laughing I I just didn't want to cos was
A	yeah
B	when they gave me the pills
A	I was acting like you were
B	oh and they gave me the blanket and I honestly thought when they offered to give me
A	mm
B	when they offered you that chair I thought they were offering me the better chair
A	and then everyone in the hospital like really bemused as to why you'd got an
A	and you were just like
B	oh my god
A	I bet after we left they were like what what was the point in that?
B	they probably just fancied a adventure
A	yeah
B	just as we did
A	they were probably that like that ward they just came out
B	let's broken arm that'll do
A	yeah
B	how are your shoes cleaning up?
A	oh well they're fine but the mud isn't coming out of the little holes and I'm very angry about it oh never walking on the grass again ever
B	you perfectionist
A	I just no cos these shoes are just they need to be clean but
B	mm
A	I'm not a perfectionist because look at the state of my room here just
B	mm
A	at the beginning of the month erm like before I got here in like August
B	I like your flannel
A	thank you it's from Ikea
B	it's really nice
B	it's very beachy
A	mm
B	or South African I can't tell
A	oh yeah it kind of looks it's a South African
B	no you don't have to hurry up it's like I'm not expecting to be entertained
B	magic mud you might need erm see they look clean now
A	I know that's the thing like cos they're so shiny and wet but then when they dry again the mud sort of comes back
B	have you got anything? like I know soap sounds a very odd idea with shoes but
A	no I've just I've got soap on this but
B	oh is there soap on here?
A	yeah I need shoe polish that's really what would be helpful here
B	and a brush
A	yeah probably I don't think they have any shoe polish though
B	I wish shoes just stayed clean
A	I know but they do look a lot better than they did
B	yeah they do they they look pretty clean to me
A	I just love these shoes they're so comfortable they're my
B	how much were they?
A	seventy quid
B	oh
A	they were
B	they look worth it though
A	like they were honestly worth it
B	to be honest they look like
A	I knew they would be
B	they'll last
A	they they're leather they're really waterproof erm they're so comfy and I've never any problem with them
B	where did you get them from?
A	er Schuh
B	oh cool
A	and it took me ages to get them cos they never have them in my size cos I have really like
A	and then and so they never have them they never have a six in or sevens which is really annoying but these are a six and I was really surprised
B	oh yeah
A	they fit me it was so lucky cos I am actually like a six and a half but
B	mm I'm six and a half as well
A	I was wearing trainers kind of
B	or six
A	oh are you?
B	yeah
A	oh good yeah you
B	my feet
A	massive shoe pal
B	massive shoe well to be honest they're not massive compared to some people like some people
A	mm
B	I know are like eight
A	really?
B	yeah
A	for girls?
B	yeah
A	wow
B	a couple of people
A	most of my friends are like size five
B	really?
A	size four and size five yeah it's ridiculous
B	would your friends steal your shoes?
A	yes
B	really?
A	they really like my black heels that I've got
B	oh
A	and they still steal them even though they don't fit and they
A	tell me that their feet are bleeding I'm like it's not my fault you you wore them
B	doesn't matter on the button does it?
A	it does
B	why?
A	cos they have to look like shop new cos they've
B	oh my
A	got to
B	come on
A	no I'm never gonna go on the mud with them ever again
B	okay go on stay stay on the clean gravel then
A	stay on the path yeah
B	how old is Demi Lovato?
A	I don't know
B	I know this sounds a very random question
A	mid-twenties maybe? not sure
B	like twenty-six
A	yeah
B	just really strange to
A	how old is Poot Lovato?
A	who knows?
A	no one even knew she existed
B	was that an actual like that is non-edited that picture?
A	I don't think it is I think it's just in really bad light like that's what I thought anyway
A	it's just a very unfortunate photo
A	I know that's amazing
B	she looks like an egg
A	I know
B	poor Demi Lovato
A	I'm really worried there's a spider up there cos
B	what?
A	there was something moving last night
B	moving?
A	yeah
B	are you sure it wasn't like a shadow in the dark?
A	it could have been like a bit of cobweb or something but even so
B	was this in the dark or was this
A	it was like kind of half-light it wasn't as bright as this I had like my lamp on
B	surely if it was moving it would have been like
A	I know I'm really scared cos I knew there would be a spider in there at some point and I haven't had a spider yet and it's just it's kind of freaking me out a bit
B	let's see
A	mm
B	oh I can see now
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah it's just
A	oh oh my god I'm a bit scared
B	there's definitely a web
A	I know it's a web is it? is it just a web?
B	but it's just something dangling on a web
A	I know
B	it's like a dead fly or something
A	oh okay I'm alright with that
B	it just keeps going up and down
A	yeah
B	oh yeah there's your English books woo
A	I just haven't touched these books it's really bad
B	what your English books?
A	just any of these books up here
B	try the
A	yeah but they would have looked nicer if I could fit all of them
B	onto one
A	yeah
B	why?
A	cos it does
A	cos it it's a theme they're all themed
B	okay put
A	this is
B	put Metamorphosis there
A	of books okay? this is all it has a theme to it
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	why?
A	cos I was being really like oh oh am I leaving? I'd better take all my stuff down
B	no
A	I know
B	are you kidding?
A	yeah it was only the other day I
B	if you'd done that I would have furiously put them up again

B	I was never really into Star Wars
A	no I was never into it like I didn't understand it but I haven't bothered to watch it since cos I don't give a shit really like it's just boring to me

B	I love her so much
A	I always get it wrong yeah she's brilliant she's so good
B	I loved her in
A	I reckon she'll win like like best Oscar for it
B	yes
A	if nothing else like comes up in time
B	I love her accent
A	I know she's so lovely
B	and she's playing an actual Irish person in this
A	mm for once
B	like usually
A	I know
B	she plays Americans
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	yeah that looks good and then there's nothing else out really is there?
B	no
A	mm
B	Apprentice is on in like six minutes
A	oh
B	ten yeah just under ten minutes
A	mm good
B	I've god I don't know if I'm just continually getting more and more exaggerated up here
A	really?
B	I
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	I'd like to be able to get to London
A	I know
B	better
A	yeah
B	but then again I can really like
A	how long does London take from where you are?
B	if I get the train from
A	it's like out of Harry Potter
B	no it's not
A	in the last book
B	is
A	he turns into a guy called
B	really?
A	Magic yeah have you not read the last book?
B	no
A	what?
A	you've not read Harry Potter?
B	I have read
A	are you shitting me?
B	I've read Harry Potter but I haven't read the last two
A	what?
B	I just never read them
A	how?
B	I just didn't
A	get out
B	sorry
A	get out
B	I'm sorry
A	god
A	you haven't read the last two Harry Potter books?
B	no
A	what was the point?
B	I should read them probably
A	why would you bother?
B	because I just
A	if you've read the rest?
B	well yeah I probably should I've got them on my Kindle
A	oh my god
B	I just never bought them my sister always used to take them so I was like okay
A	disgraceful
B	yeah it is it is pretty disgraceful actually
B	yeah
A	oh so you've spoiled it for yourself
B	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	had you had you read them all before you watched the films?
A	yeah
B	all of them?
A	yeah all of them
B	wow okay
A	yeah like when Dumbledore died it was actually a shock for me cos no one knew about it then
B	okay
A	yeah
B	why?
A	cos I remember like then
B	yeah I wish I'd read the books
A	I remember when the sixth book came out like someone spoilt the Dumbledore thing they wrote it on a bridge
B	oh god
A	wrote Dumbledore dies
A	like the day the book came out
B	really?
A	and
B	did you get upset?
B	ah
A	get upset
B	ah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	cos he was
B	yeah
A	l thought he was
B	I love Lupin
A	I can't believe you've not read the last two Harry Potter books
B	I will read them I promise before we
A	that is disgusting
B	leave
B	cos I've just got er out of the habit of reading
A	yeah
B	oh yes all this serious shit
A	who cares about that? I don't give a shit to be honest
B	to be honest like what is the point of reading
A	I'll just say go
B	things that are
A	if you if you don't
B	prestigious?
A	yeah exactly it's just up yourself really
B	like they're not necessarily better
A	like read whatever makes you happy reading Harry Potter makes me feel nice and so I do it
B	it makes you feel warm and safe
A	it really does
B	and happy
A	cos you remember how it was when you were reading it when you were younger and it was like
B	it is just childhood
A	you get that back
B	I mean those books are gonna go into
A	they really are
B	a new Harry Potter like new
A	what a book?
B	no no updating the new films like making new ones in the future
A	really?
B	yeah
A	already?
B	mm
A	bloody hell I thought it would take them like twenty years at least to
B	yeah yeah it's not gonna be released for about
A	no
B	twenty years but they're already
A	oh that's alright
B	thinking about it
A	yeah so they should like they need to update them
B	I mean how would they do it differently? they could make it darker or even darker than it is
A	no I don't think they would I think they'd
B	yeah
A	like for films
B	yeah
A	but this would be like how many films were there like eight?
B	yeah
A	eight films?
B	they wouldn't compress it into like one
A	well they couldn't that would be so many hours
B	oh my god that would be just like
A	that would be impossible
B	really vast it would just be like no that would be crap if they compressed it into one film
A	yeah
B	can you imagine?
A	but I don't really understand why cinema hasn't really evolved to make longer films because people would watch them I think
B	yeah definitely
A	like feel if I was invested in something like say if it was adapted from like my favourite book or something
B	mm
A	and it was gonna be like a four hour film so that they could fit everything in without splitting it up I would go see it
B	but then again
A	and I'd probably enjoy it
B	in terms of money they can put more films on in cinemas
A	well yeah exactly that's all it's about it's just about making money now it's like oh look we can we can charge like double for one like production cost
B	mm
A	like we've made the film together we just chopped it in half halfway through
B	and they could have more showings as well with just smaller hours like
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know it's a horrible thing
A	in the future
B	ten years
A	yeah
B	you know they've got 3D films? do you think they'll have?
A	I hope I hope 3D dies
B	I
A	I really do
B	I swear they've got they're gonna or they've already got just in very
A	oh yeah cos er erm the er there's a
B	like senses
A	thing in
B	mm
A	but it it was like a you sat in chairs and like you had like water streaming up like
B	oh my god
A	in your face and stuff
B	wow
A	so it's supposed to be like a simulation
B	it's not quite 4D it's just
A	just like you get splashed in the face sometimes and
B	imagine if there was like
A	it was pretty cool actually
B	more like that like more
A	yeah
B	films made like that
A	there probably will be yeah like for stuff like like Jurassic Park and things like that
B	oh yeah
A	that are like really
B	you'd want the full experience
B	like I can kind of see the appeal
A	and Imax as well
B	for yeah
A	that would be good
B	cos Jurassic Park would be
A	a good one to start with
B	3D a good one to do
A	yeah
B	something like that cos it's er all about the
A	or when the new Avatar comes out that would be good
B	is there a new Avatar coming out?
A	yeah yeah
B	really?
A	it's coming out like in two years or something
B	I thought it was quite boring
A	I know they're making one
B	I didn't really enjoy it
A	yeah no it was it was really long and I was like is this over yet? and
B	it wasn't really about the plot
A	but it was good in 3D
B	it was more about yeah
A	yeah
B	that graphics
A	it was the only film I'd enjoyed seeing in 3D like like I actually felt like it enhanced the experience
B	oh really?
A	yeah everything else was just
B	was the animation like beautiful?
A	yeah it was crazy it was like you could touch it like oh my god
B	wow
A	yeah it's weird
B	that's really cool when did that come out? like two thousand and eight?
A	two thousand and nine I think
B	really?
A	yeah
B	god
A	it was a long time ago
B	I remember I went to see Coraline when it came out in two thousand and eight
A	oh that film freaked me out so much
B	it is creepy
A	you kind of look like Coraline you know
B	me? oh that's lovely
A	with the bob and everything
B	should die my hair blue
A	has she got blue hair?
B	she has
A	oh she has hasn't she?
B	she has
A	oh
B	just very dark midnighty kind of blue
A	yeah
B	the ending was really creepy
A	yeah oh my god and when she turned into like a spider that was horrible
B	and the bit at the end with the face
A	mm
B	and it's like
A	oh
B	yeah it's a really twisted film
A	and the scary thing is that the mum looks just like
A	she is honestly spitting image
B	oh my god
A	and it kind of scared me for a bit cos I was like
B	I'm your other mother
A	you look so much like her
A	oh
B	no Coraline was great
A	yeah it was good
B	it really did freak me out though like the buttons
A	yeah
B	like that was horror for me at that age
B	like I didn't watch
A	it was horror it's disturbing
B	it's like children's horror
A	it is
B	I didn't
A	that's that's why it's worse
B	yeah
A	cos it's like a children's it's targeted at children and it's like really creepy and it's like
B	what I didn't know was it's actually based on a book
A	yeah
B	I saw the book the other day
A	I bet you've read it
B	no I've never read the book I just saw it the other day
A	ah we're missing it we need to go
B	okay we can go and watch it
A	yeah that's true
B	for some reason ITV Player just doesn't let you like
A	oh I hate ITV so much
B	yeah same
A	lots of air you smell so good all the time
B	can you actually smell it now?
A	yes
B	I can't
A	really strongly
B	check out the carcass that I just left
B	erm
A	oh
A	do you want some more Coke?
B	er
A	do you want some of mine?
B	yes please
A	I'm going shopping tomorrow anyway so
B	have you got ice?
A	yeah we've got ice in the freezer
B	oh my god I didn't know we had ice
B	no
A	you've seen it now
B	that'll be awesome
A	all the time
B	who? from where?
A	like we erm in like the first week of freshers' we erm had this thing from Spotify and they gave us like a free
B	oh the ice
A	this thing
A	yeah
B	do people actually fill those up?
A	I do
B	oh my
A	why is that dedicated?
B	I don't' know it just requires effort
A	are you one of those people that that like buy ice in packs or something?
B	erm maybe
A	are you actually?
B	no I don't actually buy it I always want to
B	it's like a quid it's ridiculous this really smells of pasta
A	I hate that smell
B	oh
A	pungent
B	pungent
A	pungent oh I don't think it's quite frozen yet
B	one ice
A	cos none of it's frozen yet
B	you can have the ice
A	no you can have the ice you're the guest
B	I'm not your guest
A	well you're not the guest but you
B	it's in our house
A	oh
B	you you fool
A	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
B	you have the ice it's cool
A	too late you've already got the ice
B	yeah there is literally no difference between
A	look at that that's so cool it's er got
B	oh my god
A	bubbles in it cos it's going in tiny
B	it's not quite like
A	wow
B	ice in there
A	is in there
B	okay
A	or I sometimes move it if there's no room but it's it's always there
B	woo
A	I don't wait for it the whole week
B	as in like our highlights of television at the
A	yeah
B	university experience
B	television is just life
B	yeah yeah
A	apparently though they're gonna start charging for it because people keep dodging the licence fee by just using Iplayer and not paying it
B	no
A	cos you do have to pay for Iplayer at the moment but they said on the news they're gonna try and close that loophole
B	really?
A	so people might have to start paying for it
B	what? pay to watch things back?
A	mm mm
B	or watch live TV?
A	just well any of it like to watch Iplayer at all
B	that's horrible
A	yeah I mean it makes sense though because they're not making any money off the licence if people keep dodging it
B	I guess but it's just
A	but I kind of get why they ask us for money because like it's a public service like
B	mm
A	you know I don't know
B	but it's just like
A	but it is quite a lot though it's a hundred pounds
B	what they're charging a hundred pounds?
A	that's how much the licence fee is
B	how and you just have to pay that initially?
A	a year
B	a year?
A	yeah
B	oh god
A	and that's that's why
B	pay
A	we get BBC like that's how we
B	for Iplayer
A	how they keep going
B	oh my god yeah I I think I did hear about this
A	mm
B	I just wanna see how much I'm curious how much they'd actually pay
A	well
B	is this this summer as in like
A	oh right
B	oh god
A	mm
B	that means I'll have to watch like
A	mm
B	I think young
A	the only it's only the
A	uhu
B	good
A	oh my god
B	what's wrong?
A	that's so horrible
B	what's happened?
A	a erm a police dog was blown up in the Paris raids
B	yeah yeah I read that
A	mm that's so horrible
B	when a suicide bomber like
A	oh
B	do you think it's right to have dogs like going on stuff like that?
A	erm
B	I don't know
A	I don't know
B	neither do I I never I never thought about it until I saw that this morning
A	mm
B	like obviously they they can do like great service like they can save lives
A	yeah
B	but it's like it's a dog like it does not have
A	it doesn't the poor dog
B	it doesn't probably doesn't know what it's doing
A	well it does cos they're really well trained but
B	yeah
A	that's still really sad
A	oh look at its face it's dead
B	it's like a
A	it's not alive anymore
B	oh
B	oh my god I am dog
A	it's quite literally I am dog
B	I am dog
B	oh dear
A	does that mean they caught another terrorist though?
B	they caught another terrorist?
A	if it exploded does that mean the terrorist died as well?
B	hopefully
A	cos didn't you say it was like a self
B	yeah it was a suicide bomber
A	yeah
B	it was a suicide bomber it wasn't like
