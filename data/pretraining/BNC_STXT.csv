B	yeah he he's on benefits cos he's too fat to work?
C	yeah
B	yeah I didn't know that was a thing
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah he is
B	it's cos he cos it's a classed as a
D	do you know you know that you know
B	is it classed as a disability?
D	yeah because you know the really really The Fattest Man in Britain?
B	yeah
D	the one who's an absolute dickhead?
B	mm
D	he got so big he couldn't work and he earned more than someone who has a full time good job earned right and then he had to get a a
A	gastric band
D	gastric band and then he lost loads and loads of weight to obviously because he couldn't eat as much so they took he a lot of his carers off him so he started kicking off about that
B	oh yeah I saw that
D	saying how he deserved this
B	no he was like
D	his money halved
B	yeah cos he was like he wasn't he like I wish I'd died
D	yeah
B	cos they took his care away
D	took his care care allowance off him
B	well I just thought that was because he was so fat he couldn't walk but he had loads of other health issues so he wouldn't have been able to work anyway I didn't realise like if you were obese
D	yeah
B	like that
D	yeah
B	and you can but you can still walk
D	yeah
B	that you can be on benefits
D	yeah
D	cos you've got health issues cos of it
B	see
D	bad for your bones when I'm just like
C	bad for your bones
D	really? stop eating all them foods
B	did you see that erm
B	were on like that were disabled
B	and that suppose they couldn't work here they'd give them an assessment by a doctor send them somewhere like basically say you can do this this and this maybe and then they'd go and assess them in a work placement somewhere
D	mm
B	and then if it was too much for them then they'd be like you can't work there we'll try and find you something else
D	mm
B	there's nothing wrong with your fingers
D	yeah
B	and that and then basically brought around like a house spy cos apparently they used to send these people round
D	yeah
B	to come and assess them in the living situation but what they were actually doing was spying on them to see if they were actually like properly disabled or they were just like basically taking the piss
D	yeah
B	so this woman went in basically said she's fine to work she was proper kicking off and everything refusing she was like I'm not working and then the benefits office were like well a doctor and this woman's cleared you for work you either work or we take all your benefits off you and she was like nearly crying and they were like no they were like you've been cleared you can work you're going to work
D	pisses me off
B	and er but that poor lad in the wheelchair all he wanted to do was work
D	yeah a lot of them do though
B	and that cos he was born with it and he couldn't and then he went and did this thing and he was dead happy cos he was outside and everything like that in this fresh air and that and then they were like it's too much it was too much hard labour on
D	yeah
B	stuff or it was so sad
C	it distresses me if there's no fish
A	I think there is a secret fish in there you know
C	the secret fish
A	it's like the angelfish
A	pardon me
C	thank you very much
A	oh my god that is awful
A	what's it about?
C	it's like it the book's about like loads of like wannabe writers and they all go to this like writing retreat and it's like interspersed with all their short stories that they write but there's one called Guts and it's fucking horrible he sits on like the bottom of a pool the bottom of his pool like having a wank and sits on a pool fan cos he likes the feeling of it and then he like finishes and swims up and then he looks down and he can't move anymore and he sees like his intestines caught in the pool fan so he's like it's come out of his body and he can see it down there and he has to chew through it to get out
A	it makes me wanna
D	on a Wednesday or on a on a Saturday it's
B	yeah
D	it's like all the food vendors are out and there's the veggie van as well
B	what sort of
D	so that's like
B	yeah
D	and then he makes halloumi ones as well or you can get a mixed veg wrap or you can have like halloumi and falafel
B	what's a falafel?
D	it's like
B	mm
D	and like spices in like a little ball they look kind of like meatballs they're not and that and they're like normally they've got like breadcrumbs round them and then like you just cook them and like fry them or grill them or whatever they're real nice
B	mm I think I'd like
C	yeah

B	mm
D	so she's got so she's booked it from twelve till three
B	how come you can only book it
D	erm it's so other it's so it's fair so other people can get in as well
B	mm
D	but we're like
B	mm
D	but normally like if there's a lot of us in there people that have actually booked it it's normally like they'll they'll come in and they'll see that we're in there and they're like they they'll go somewhere else if there's space but like we normally don't get kicked out
B	what does it look like?
D	there's like there's different types like most of them are like open so there's just like some chairs in there or there's like beanbags and stuff like that but they've all
B	mm
D	got big screens but in that we go in it's like actually got like it's it's got a glass like window and door
B	mm
D	so that you like blocks out the sound of like everyone else so it's like a proper little learning pod thing that we can go in
B	mm

B	I love it
D	so
B	but I ain't
D	so it'll be good but I normally get

B	why?
D	cos if you go in there on your own
B	mm
D	and you're sat in this big room by yourself and there's one person in there and there's like loads of people looking around for spaces to sit you look like a massive like knob
B	mm
D	cos you're sat in there on your own
D	we had to share a table with
B	I
D	and erm we went in
B	mm
D	and that and then they like they were dead busy so they were like oh there's a bit table come available so you if you don't mind sharing with another group then and that and we were like yeah not bothered that's fine went and sat down there's these three like Scottish people like a man wife and teenage daughter absolutely miserable as

C	oh yeah
B	oh
D	and like take them home I should have bought one shouldn't I? and then we could have had it today
C	yeah
B	do you know
A	basically what he's just said is I've had a job so I am allowed to be fat
A	because the government's paying for me to be fat because I haven't just sat on my arse I have had a job
D	the people no the best people are the ones where they're on benefits because
B	mm
D	and they sit and say well my mum and dad worked all their lives
B	oh yeah

D	like that erm but when we were applying they had a discount off so basically the the price of having a double bed was basically the
B	mm
D	but they had no single beds left at this point cos we were like really late in applying
B	mm
D	so we had to get a double anyways
D	and that but yeah it
B	mm
D	the size of our flat for five people was
B	mm
