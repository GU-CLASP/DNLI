A	voila toast while the bagel's defrosting
B	you can't have toast and a bagel
A	mm
B	no I'd just like you to have a bit of pasta
B	it's spaghetti carbonara
A	yes but I don't want pasta
B	but it's yeah we try things though and we have things that we're not as keen on
B	you had a burger yesterday and
A	but I don't but I terribly do not like spaghetti carbonara
C	well
A	not which you like not me
C	and pasta which you like
A	I don't particularly like pasta
B	yeah well I'd just like you to try it please just have a bit please
C	mm
D	why thank you very much
A	can I just have pasta and cheese?
B	no cos we've mixed it now
D	it's nice
C	it's not nice
D	it is nice
C	it isn't
D	lovely
B	just have a little bit please
A	but I don't I don't like it
D	well I don't like pears but to prove my love I ate some pear
A	yes but I don't need to prove love
B	no but you do need to just suck it up and eat what I serve
A	okay I'll have a teensy-weensy bit and then I'll have something else
B	there you go
A	too big
B	no it isn't
A	it is it's pretty much the same as
D	well just eat what you can
A	okay I'll eat what I want done
B	don't be so silly
A	I'll eat a little bit
D	just try it it's very nice
B	now I want you eat the pancetta cos you like bacon and that's just Italian
A	Jamaican Italian pig
B	not Jamaican no
A	Jamaican bacon
B	Jamaican bacon?
A	you'll get hiccups like I do
D	this is something
A	I wonder why you don't get hiccups for breathing too heavily cos if you hold your breath they go away
B	a spasm in the diaphragm
A	okay
D	and you use your diaphragm to breathe so when you hold your breath you basically stop using your diaphragm so your diaphragm has time to settle down and stop spasming
B	mm
D	that's what happens
A	okay but
D	and the reason it's spasming is just because it's not getting enough blood to it therefore if you stop it from working the blood flow can then go into it
A	and then you die
D	mm
B	and then you die? no
A	well you faint
B	no
C	if you hold your breath too long you do faint
B	it's pretty much impossible to hold your breath
D	until you faint
B	yeah
A	yeah but you can
B	but if you fainted your
A	yeah true unless you had Sellotape around your nose and your mouth
D	that's called suffocating that
B	mm
A	yeah but you'd still die
D	that that's completely different
A	yeah you'd die
B	mm
A	what? through
B	no but it would still er automatically try and take those breaths in
C	and out
B	cos that's what happens when people drown
D	mm they start breathing underwater
B	must be horrible mustn't it?
D	yeah well apparently it's very a very peaceful death
B	it can't be cos when you breathe in all the water will come into your lungs and
D	yeah
B	that pressure must feel horrible
D	and it's the whole motion of breathing in and out
B	but your
D	it's cos the oxygen because the oxygen levels are already quite low you're already kind of sleepy
A	that's why it's so although how can sharks breathe?
B	I don't know they've got gills haven't they?
A	yeah
D	mm
A	do gills like let in all the oxygen? and then
B	mm
D	well there's oxygen in the water
A	yeah
D	and what gills do
D	so they flow through and out of the gills so it goes is it through the mouth and out the gills?
B	I dunno so I don't know if they kind of breathe or not I dunno
B	but whales need to come up for air don't they?
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and
B	which seems a bit ridiculous
A	so do dolphins
B	no they I know they can hold it for ages but it just seems like a really
B	I know but why hasn't it evolved so they just can be under the water the whole time? just seems a completely unnecessary thing
D	cos they're mammals
B	mm
A	it would take a lot of evolving
B	mm
D	but when you're that big
A	mm
D	you don't
B	apart from us
D	in the wild
B	no but I'm just saying
A	no they're our predators
B	they're too big to be out of the water oh there were some
A	yeah
B	very sad
D	mm
B	very sad so they can't exist outside of the water so it seems
D	no
B	weird that they have that connection outside of the water still
D	but the only reason that they can't survive out of the water is because their body weight is so huge
B	mm
D	the pressure is too much on their internal organs and that's why they die
B	I know
D	did they?
B	yeah
D	what were they?
B	what were they?
D	mm
B	they were whales but they could they could walk when you look at the whale have you erm? I've told you this before in the Natural History Museum or in fact in the Zoology Museum in
D	well maybe
B	but they were much smaller then
D	thousands of years ago they used to escape dinosaurs
D	and they went they
B	whales?
D	mm
B	I don't think they were around
B	in dinosaur time
C	how do you know?
B	they
D	evolved
B	they definitely did walk
B	yeah
D	maybe they evolved to just live in the water to avoid all the
B	yes they did evolve to live in the water I don't know why
D	cos it's not orange it's amber
B	it is orange
C	mum can I have my second portion
A	yeah
B	it is orange
D	it's not
C	mm
B	well you've just taken all the pancetta you can put that back and have some more pasta
A	actually there's lots of there's a quite a bit of pancetta there
B	put it back and have some more of the pasta that's in there cos you've had hardly any
C	okay I'll have some more
B	is amber a specific shade then? I mean amber you can get green amber and yellow amber and
A	yeah
B	it is orange
D	it's not orange
D	or amber
C	and also erm there isn't another
B	well there is there's loads of different types of words for green
C	okay
D	like emerald
B	or jade
A	or green
C	yeah but it sounds nice amber
C	like
B	I always thought it was a bit weird
A	and emerald is a type of stone
B	it's a type of it's a shade of colour of green
C	yeah but emerald is
B	but amber isn't
B	a
D	yeah but I suppose some people say amber
B	they don't necessarily do they?
D	wait for the yellow light and you think yellow light? what are you on about?
B	it's not yellow
D	okay it's okay wait for the amber light they go ah now you're talking about
B	only because David Brent erm that has occurred
D	I'm not like David Brent is it
D	cos I did that?
B	it's cos you pointed your finger at me
D	fact
B	hang on
D	fact
D	oops cheers
B	we'd only we only know what it means because we historically use it in that way I can't believe you're having seconds and we had a late lunch and you had a packet of crisps just before dinner
C	mm
C	can I have
D	well believe it sister
B	eat some more pasta
D	there's like hardly anything here

D	I'm pretty much finishing it all off
C	are you?
B	you've not had enough
A	okay I'll have another forkful
C	you
B	you need to have half
D	no I haven't there's loads there
A	I've had I have had enough look

C	doesn't want to eat it I'll eat it mum
A	what's that?
B	come on
A	okay I'll have another fork full and then that will be
B	no you'll have half of what's in the bowl now any ideas about what we'd like to do in half term?

C	yeah
A	I was just wondering
B	okay which is a Monday
D	when's mine?
B	thirteenth of April
B	nineteen eighty-five
D	no
B	not nineteen eighty-five?
D	nineteen ninety I'm twenty-five
B	no you're not don't you lie
B	you're young enough
B	good grief
D	that would've scared you if I'd been lying about my age wouldn't it?
B	yes
A	yeah
C	can I eat the rest?
B	why don't you just finish it?
C	can I eat the rest?
B	no
C	why why why?
B	cos you can't have two enormous bowls of spaghetti
A	mm
D	yes
C	ow
B	no you can't have some crisps
A	why not?
B	cos you've had some pasta
B	you can have some fruit
D	it's because I'm big and I need to eat lots
C	so do I
B	could have the burger bun just on its own with butter margarine
C	it's not
A	is pasta carbohydrate?
D	it is
B	it is yes
A	is bread carbohydrate?
D	that was weird it it is
B	is?
A	bread carbohydrate?
B	yes
A	is crisps carbohydrate?
B	yes
A	then why aren't I allowed crisps?
B	cos you're supposed to be having pasta so you're certainly not gonna have some crisps
D	mm
B	and the cheese and the eggs
D	and the cheese and the eggs yeah
C	they're nice
B	so it's a more balanced meal
D	mm
A	then if I'm allowed
D	so if you stop
A	burger bun then why aren't I allowed crisps instead?
B	cos it's better
D	mm
B	there's less salt there's no salt hardly any in that
A	but there's no but I'm
B	all crisps have got salt on them
D	mm
B	and they have been fried so there's really very little nutritional value in a packet of crisps
A	okay I'll have the burger bun
B	right
A	and I will have margarine in it
B	you alright there
D	mm
A	the zone of carbonara
