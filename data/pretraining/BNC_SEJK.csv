A	smells nice
A	yes it has
A	mm yes it does
B	did a nice lot didn't it?
A	mm
B	so what have you achieved this morning?
A	mm smells good erm not a lot
B	well that's good
A	er yes I slept in a long time
B	yes
C	would you like any bread
A	erm er yes please I will have a slice
C	is that enough?
A	yes thank you that's lovely
C	I'll just get
A	thank you
B	oh yeah?
A	and
B	oh that's nice
A	emailed my friend
B	yes
A	yeah
A	read a bit
B	ah yes what do you think of that book? Summertime?
A	ah yes that's one's very good I like how it started
B	oh right
A	quite interesting
B	yeah yes it is because it's
A	yes and it's
B	I remember that one
A	it's quite interesting cos it's looking at two issues as well
B	yes
A	the erm returning soldiers
B	mm
A	and then also how the black erm
A	were treated at that time
A	but also how difficult it must've been cos they were treated very differently in France
B	yes yes that's right
A	and then they came back and then had to
B	yes
A	do all the racism and then seeing it as a sort of chance to
B	yes
A	make changes but of course people who hadn't been to war didn't see it like that
B	no
A	they just wanted to
B	no no
A	keep going in the same way and they were fine with it
B	yes
A	it must've been doubly difficult for them
B	mm
A	yeah
B	because you have to be so knowledgeable haven't you? about the facts there's no point if you've got it all wrong
A	yes that's right it seems like that author did
B	mm yes
B	no I found it very interesting
A	mm
B	treated very badly weren't they? the soldiers on the
A	terrible
C	was that the First World War?
A	yes
C	yeah
A	this is about the erm black soldiers returning to
C	right
A	Florida
A	which was particularly bad because they had more lynchings there than anywhere else in the States and when they came back it was the depression as well
C	yeah
A	so actually it was probably worse than before they left less work
C	yeah
A	and the whites wanted to consolidate power
C	yeah
A	so it actually got worse for them
B	and haven't things changed in a relatively short time?
A	yeah it's good mm
A	yes it is good
B	mm
B	mm
A	you don't really see that in the UK but
B	no
C	it seems to be
A	yeah sort of underlying racism in
C	yes
B	mm
A	in er well yes er what I thought was interesting was the segregation
B	oh
C	oh yeah yeah
A	ate in the cafeteria the blacks would all sit at one table and the whites would all sit at others that was totally by their choice
C	mm
A	I thought that was very worrying
C	mm
B	yes
A	cos er that wouldn't happen in the UK would it?
B	no
C	no
A	it would never be that extreme
B	no no
A	mm
A	yes they do
C	and of course there's immediately there's an immediate riot
A	yes
A	well yes it does seem there's problems of
C	yeah it's more
A	institutionalised racism as well
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but erm I think things have moved on a lot cos when I was at college there were just about four African students
A	mm
B	and I was
A	mm
B	erm you know for the holidays and things so I'd go and sort of chat
A	yes
B	but er but otherwise they seemed to be completely separate they
A	oh right
B	separate race but that wouldn't happen today would it?
C	no
A	no
B	no
A	yes
B	right I'm just going to check the cauliflower
A	mm
A	kept well
C	mm
A	getting soup twice today
C	mm
A	pea pod soup
C	oh yes do you need anything with it?
A	spring onions yes
C	yes
A	clever though you can make soup from anything
C	yeah yeah
A	I don't know I haven't
C	mm
A	read it
C	shall I take that
A	oh thank you
A	nice cider
B	mm
C	well I'm
A	oh right oh that's a lot
C	and I'll do a third
A	yes on that side one?
C	down that side yes
A	mm
C	it won't be finished but it'll be
A	yes
C	erm
A	oh
C	just in a wheelbarrow
A	yes has the lavender gone in?
A	oh that's good oh it's good to get them in now we've just had all the rain so that's good isn't it?
C	mm yes
A	mm
C	yeah
A	cos it's not that cold in the winter
C	in the summer
A	it's more about the wind and the shelter
A	yeah
A	ah yes that's right I wouldn't mind going there one day have a look
C	forget what it's called
A	have you been?
C	no
A	well I wouldn't mind stopping in there yes that must be alright mustn't it? they're outside
C	well yes of course that's on a
A	yeah and grandpa had a vine didn't he? in that greenhouse for years
C	yeah
A	but I think the roots were outside
C	yeah
A	mm so you're not tempted to grow chillies after the front page story in The Times?
A	no
C	but you know
A	I suppose if you're on your own it's not difficult to
C	no
A	put one in whatever you're cooking
C	no
A	guess you could do something easy like chilli con carne
C	cook about normally about three three times a week yeah
A	that's just one pot cooking isn't it?
C	yeah
A	mm
A	yes that's just one pot and then rice
C	yeah
A	yes
C	what's it called?
A	dal D A L
C	I I don't know actually
A	ah well you can
C	is it spicy?
A	yes so it's a very cheap meal so everywhere in the Gulf if you go to a local restaurant properly local then it'll be run by either Bangladeshis or Indian
C	mm
A	and they never have a menu and they can't speak English but if you say dal
C	and is it
A	it's just lentils basically lentils red lentils
C	I've got quite a lot of lentils I've got red and green
A	ah yes you can either use the small red ones or the bigger erm split
C	green
A	yellow lentils and then you just basically
C	yeah
A	boil them until they turn to mush it's like porridge
C	yeah
A	thing really and then in a different pan you'd fry an onion and some chilli
C	yeah
A	and then add that at the end with butter a knob of butter and if you want people put in chopped tomatoes it's very one of those really economical meals
C	yeah
A	which you can see
C	and do they have anything with it? like rice? or garlic bread?
A	erm yes you often get rice or bread with it
C	something just to
C	yeah
A	so the bread usually bread cos then you just
A	scoop it yes or you can thin it down a bit and make it into soup but erm yes that's quite nice I have that for lunch sometimes
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	is it hot? er hot? or?
A	yes but you can choose how hot
C	you can just have less of it can't you?
A	yes you can choose how much you put in yes
B	to put in
A	yes er but if you have it in a restaurant it's very hot oh this looks lovely thank you
B	that's good cos there's plenty more
A	oh lovely smells nice
C	thank you
A	mm nice colour
C	yeah
A	that's the
C	yes
B	but going back to novels I think
A	mm
B	you can
A	yes
B	you know when you read
A	mm that's true
A	so you liked that one did you?
B	I thought it was very good I think it was was it her first book? I think it was
A	oh is it? mm okay
B	yes
A	no mm
B	he's good
A	oh right
C	is he a comedian?
B	no
C	no not him
B	no
A	what are you reading now mum?
B	erm I am reading that one I told you I was reading before which was
A	ah the Fay Mcdermott? yeah
B	Mcdermott yes erm the title escapes me but it's been very good
A	mm
B	erm so I'm just trying to finish that off this afternoon
A	oh that's nice it's lovely weather
B	yes and then I could pass it on to
A	mm
B	and I think I'll give the daughter one
A	ah yes
B	mm
A	I finished The Taxidermist's Daughter and put that in there too
B	oh right okay yeah that'll be nice
A	mm nice meat that is
B	oh good and you got this one erm somewhere else didn't you? not the supermarket
C	no the I found them on the way to
A	oh right mm that's good
A	is it cheap there?
C	erm no it might be a tiny bit more
A	oh okay
C	er a little bit more than the supermarket but erm
A	it's fresh
C	it's er it's a very very very big herd of
A	oh right oh that's nice
C	and that's the
B	mm
C	in between
A	mm
C	which is called
A	oh okay
C	and they it's a big big butcher on this farm
A	oh right mm
C	it's a lady who runs it
B	which is particularly nice
C	mm
B	it's really tender and it's cooked a bit longer
C	yeah yeah
A	mm it's a good way to do meat
B	but I think when you're cooking for two it's to be honest it's worth paying a bit more for quality if er if you're doing steaks
A	mm
B	I mean that's different cos that is a huge expenditure
A	yes
C	yeah
A	no it's true things like stewing steak's terrible isn't it?
B	mm
A	full of fat
B	mm
A	it's got a nice flavour the sauce that's the beer isn't it?
B	oh yes I'm glad you liked it
A	mm
A	oh that's nice I told
B	oh right okay
A	strange coincidence wasn't it?
B	yes it is you gave me that one didn't you? that that that cookery book?
C	er yes
C	one of those Good Housekeeping or something
A	yes they're good those ones
B	mm
A	no only that email
B	yeah
A	a couple of days ago
B	oh yes okay yes I had this the photos and about two lines but you know
A	mm
B	it's nice to know she's okay
A	yes
B	so grandpa and
A	oh that's nice
A	mm
A	yes
B	mm very keen
A	yes
B	he well he we don't know he
A	ah
A	oh right
A	yes
B	erm so it's gonna cost an awful lot of money
A	yes
B	probably gave him something towards it
A	uhu
B	and he was meant to have it this month
A	mm
B	mm
A	oh good
B	yes I
A	mm
B	and
C	yeah
A	when did you last see
B	erm that's a good question
A	ah right
B	the ninetieth
A	mm
B	and
A	oh that's nice
B	it's a long way to drive and he gets very very tired
A	mm
B	but he came in on a Zimmer frame
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it was quite bad
A	unlucky cos it's
B	mm
A	some people it doesn't develop very fast does it?
C	mm no
A	go for years
A	oh right
B	and this is the sort the bad sort
A	mm
B	so he
C	mm
B	could be
A	and
B	erm yes that's right
A	that was awful for them
B	well she died quite young though didn't she?
A	mm
A	they had to put her in a home
B	mm
A	her dad got just couldn't cope in the end
B	mm
A	very depressed as well
A	mm
B	that she actually moved
C	mm
B	cos he's erm you know a lot of the time
A	mm
A	oh er I think I met her once mm
B	yeah and she was in a wheelchair but I
A	mm
B	don't think she is any worse
A	no
B	did you enjoy that?
C	yes I did
B	oh good
C	mm
B	can always pour a bit of extra beer in
A	oh I don't know
B	mm
C	pardon me
B	too much choice
A	that's right
B	have you
A	oh right yes it's a full day for you
C	mm well I don't normally do that twice but erm just
A	dad said he put the lavender in
B	ah yes I've heard
C	yeah
B	that sounds good doesn't it? does it look nice?
C	yes
B	mm
C	it's a bit
B	yes
A	mm
A	yes
C	I've put
A	mm
B	and does it flower once a year? or twice?
C	well sometimes twice
B	mm
A	and it flowers for a long time
B	oh does it? oh that's good
A	mm
B	oh good
A	yes
B	that'll be nice
A	yes
C	yeah
A	oh right I worked on a lavender farm in Australia
B	oh did you?
A	it was lovely can you imagine how beautiful it was?
C	yeah
A	just purple for you know acres and acres
C	yes you you
A	just all
C	yes they're very rare aren't they?
C	well you get them in the south of France
A	yes
C	and there's one or two in England I was reading
A	ah right yes
C	lavender farms
A	cos it's very specialist
C	yeah
A	and you need really to have your own distillery or whatever it's called on
C	yeah
A	on site so then that becomes specialist
C	yeah
A	cos they extract the oil don't they usually?
C	yeah
B	so what did you have to do? sort of weeding and watering?
A	well no I think it was that was all taken care of it was all mulched so and they were well established
B	oh yes
A	no
B	mm
A	no it was nice
C	did you want any more
A	I'm full actually but thank you
C	mm
A	it was very nice
B	did you want more?
C	er no I think er thank I would like more
C	but I I think I'll
C	leave it for now
A	okay
C	are you going to have more?
B	yes
A	oh I don't think that's a problem in this house
C	yeah so er
A	I suppose the other problem with having it in the middle
B	mm
A	is you don't really keep track of how much you've had
B	no
A	if it's on a plate you know you've had one portion
C	a helping yeah
B	yes
C	and if someone yeah
A	yes but it's like with wine isn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	someone's always topping your glass up it's quite hard
C	to know how much
B	mm
A	to keep track of how much you've had
C	yes
B	yes
A	whereas if you have a
C	yes
A	then you know you've had that much
C	yeah
B	yes that's true
C	yes we all have a bottle each
B	but some people don't like it especially if you don't know them erm they've got small appetites and you serve
C	oh yeah got too much
A	yeah that's true
B	and I think
A	yes it could be a bit embarrassing if
B	yes
A	or there's something that they don't like
A	and then they feel bad cos they're leaving it
C	yeah you're leaving it yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so we think you er you're alright
C	well that's how I
C	no
A	well
C	oh
B	oh that's good
A	which is
C	and that's Fridays?
A	yes
C	is that right?
A	yes Fridays
C	January?
A	till January till April
B	that's
A	at
B	mm
A	good to come back and
A	have something
B	mm
A	lined up
C	yeah
B	yes
A	you know you know at least I've got time plenty of time to do any outside reading as well
C	yes
B	mm
A	yeah
B	well it's
A	no
C	yeah
A	fixed
B	yes
C	yeah
A	focus isn't it?
B	yes
A	it's nice cos it means I'll definitely do it now otherwise I've lost the deposits
C	well yeah
A	otherwise you could put it off and then not pick on the course and then it goes on another six months
A	and then
C	and it gives you time then to be on the if it goes alright
A	mm
C	apply after Easter for
A	that's right the
C	the next
A	yes
C	yeah
A	yes that's right
C	rather than losing the next September does it start in September the next one?
A	yes
C	ah
A	I think so
C	yes
B	and that's two years?
A	yes but part time again
B	yeah what? two days a week?
A	I can't remember that one
B	no
A	wasn't that
B	no
C	might be could be one day a week
A	might be yes
C	cos it's
A	cos it's for longer
C	thirty or thirty-five
A	yes they skip the holidays they said
C	mm
A	but otherwise it's
C	yeah
A	all the time
B	mm
A	will be interesting anyway
B	yes it will
A	and I was er they've sent their the biographies of their tutors and interesting they they were pretty much I think all of them were PGCE trained
B	oh were they?
A	teachers for years
C	mm wanted a break yeah
A	and they moved into it and er most of them still work
A	in schools but as counsellors now
C	yes
A	or behavioural units for children excluded from schools
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	quite interesting so yes
C	so similar so still linked then to schools
A	yes
C	yeah
A	abuse you know and alcoholic abuse that sort of thing
B	mm
A	but yes I suppose there's a lot of overlap isn't there?
B	yes
A	jobs particularly if you stay working with teenagers
B	yeah
A	or something
B	mm
B	uhu
B	so you might get a job
A	maybe yes
B	yes
A	mm
C	they used to have a I said to
A	yeah that's good
B	yes
C	full time
A	it's surprising
B	mm
C	yes it was yes
A	still not
C	I didn't come across that not a full time
A	no
C	member of staff
A	I've only seen it once
C	ever ever since
B	mm
A	yeah I think it will come in more now
C	yeah
A	but you
A	you think for the teachers that must make a big difference being able to refer someone
C	yeah
B	yes
A	internally
B	yes
A	cos external it would have to be terrible before
C	yeah
A	anything's done cos they're not going to send people in are they?
B	mm
A	mm would be nice
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	you'll be analysing us
C	mm
B	behaviour when you come
C	I know
A	watch what you say
A	yeah
B	I was nervous with
A	yeah
B	it doesn't bother me now
A	no she's not being paid so she's not bothered
C	no she's not doing it properly
B	sometimes she asks you too many questions but you just sort of say well I just don't want to do this or say this
C	I don't want to do
B	well I'm glad you like that
A	mm
C	yeah
A	it's very nice
B	yes you'll have to rate the menus
A	mm
A	yes put them on Tripadvisor
B	now do you like and it's nothing to do with my cooking fish and chips from the shop?
A	ah yes I do
B	oh well I get
A	occasionally
B	yes occasionally well we hardly ever have them and we do like them
A	yes
B	and they're good
A	oh right
B	I thought when we come back from
A	yes
B	that'll be a nice thing to do wouldn't it?
A	oh yes that'd be lovely
B	to stop there
A	mm
A	yes that's good
A	oh good

A	oh right
B	and it was
A	ah
B	she was about five
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	that's awkward for her isn't it as a five-year-old?
A	mm
B	it bothered her so I think
A	yeah
B	she she needed another girl didn't she really?
A	yes
B	two boys and
A	yes
B	mm
B	yes
A	mm
B	but I'm glad you had a nice time they took you out to nice things didn't they?

B	oh right did you er do you like that?
A	yeah I do mm
A	oh mm

A	mm
B	mm
A	which is true
B	mm yes
A	er really they just need to change the benefits system and then it would stop of its own accord wouldn't it?
C	yeah
