A	testing one two three testing I still don't know where the microphone is
B	oh look here we are again
A	yes
B	we're doing it now
A	yes
B	but also most
A	washing
B	DIY projects
B	and chores
A	we have been doing a lot of DIY projects
B	is he rapping?
A	oh is he rapping?
B	is he preaching?
A	mm yeah now there's no need to walk so fast
B	doesn't really look like a rapper there's plane taking off there look
A	there's a plane taking off
B	ready? we're about to start the path and go
A	mm
A	I might get tired yes we'll see cos this it's quite something for me really but look at this stunning day blue skies and we get to look at the water cos we are lucky
B	it's high tide again
A	look it's the same time as yesterday
B	the first one to see
A	a duck
B	a duck
A	well thing is if I had the clip-on microphone I wouldn't have to hold this
B	look the
A	yep
B	and unloaded on that pier there was a big boat yesterday on it on the pier
A	it's good your mum would love this oh
B	yes oh
A	gosh it's lovely it it is though look at that
A	it doesn't no
B	nothing just that
A	just that?
B	those three blocks and the
A	yeah but then then
B	the
A	in north
B	yeah that's what we would have had to actually
A	yeah the thing is I would have thought that yeah we would have had to get the
B	no but we would have got the er the the the ferry
A	yeah
B	the crossing the ferry
A	but er which wouldn't have been that bad but a bit erm
B	ah yes you would have
B	you wouldn't have known what side
A	yeah well they didn't did they?
B	you wouldn't have known what side of the river
A	well I didn't know there was a big difference
B	it would be quite funny if the the bus did get on the ferry and took as across
A	but we actually only really got to know
B	erm well the bit towards
A	and it gradually seeps into your consciousness doesn't it?
B	the bit towards erm
A	and we had just started to really
B	but that wasn't worth it until until the last couple of years
A	yeah there wasn't really anything there
B	well two thousand and twelve I suppose
A	it's true
B	but I would have gone a lot of times
A	but actually
B	to the
A	yes
B	pizza and beer?
A	er but
B	lovely sound
A	I mean when did we actually start taking that walk through the park and then going to
B	didn't we always do that dearest?
A	no we I don't think we did
B	well when
A	no we didn't so what did we do when
B	we watched that mini telly in your bedroom and
A	yeah
B	made love
A	but we must have done other things but I remember
B	never even went in the garden
A	we never even went in the garden no so what were we doing?
B	I just said watching telly and having
A	yeah
B	relations
A	and sleeping
B	plus remember you were working
A	napping
B	till midnight weren't you so
A	yeah
B	probably didn't get up until
A	and then just slept at the weekends
B	late afternoon
A	as well
B	yeah
A	oh well that I mean that was quite nice really
B	yeah
A	but not ideal because it's nice to have a bit of a life but the thing about working full time like that is it just you don't really get one
B	and then then we became briefly wealthy
B	relatively wealthy
A	yeah we did you know we acted like we were
B	wealthy
A	wealthy
B	didn't save a single penny
A	and didn't and bloody wasted it
B	yeah
A	and I used to go to Primark every weekend and Primarni and spend all my money
B	not at Primark darling you were constantly coming back with things from Whistles and
A	oh yeah at that time yeah it depends what period we're looking at
B	when we were wealthy
A	yeah okay that one
B	yeah
A	that's crazy
B	I think you wanted a new dress every week
A	yeah
B	and you got one
A	but I mean actually I don't think I looked particularly better than I
B	can I look at the swimming pool?
A	do oh I've not seen it
B	nor have I well you can't really see in can you?
A	oh that's the children's one that's nice
B	for babies
A	oh it's a bit of a shame that looks really nice it's going isn't it?
B	how many are in the big pool? it doesn't look very busy
A	no oh we should go there that's fun
B	oh and on this walk darling we'll pass the bouldering
A	yeah
B	climbing thing
A	but isn't there some art studios somewhere?
B	I
A	yeah I've heard there are some art studios
B	I think I'm more interested in bouldering
A	yeah no I am as well but
B	is there a swimming pool through there too?
A	the crucial thing is having a nice
B	look there's another pool
A	but if there's another way of
B	oh that that's a
A	getting in
B	that's for er little children but not tiny ones
A	for example you could go and come this way instead of the other way you could walk through the
B	darling where do we go now?
A	I'm not sure oh that's a shame
B	you have to just go round the ferry
A	mm interesting down the steps
B	it's much bigger this place than you give it think it is what's through there? oh that's be the gym
A	it's an enormous thing to knock down
B	yeah
A	considering they probably only built it in the nineties
B	yeah look darling that's the gym
A	what a waste of money
B	want to go up there?
A	oh
B	or can we turn there?
A	can we go
B	I think we're just erm oh
A	that's where what?
B	you board the ferry as a
A	no
B	oh
A	ice cream
B	like being at the seaside really
A	yeah it is
B	is it the
A	look there it is back again
B	so
A	passenger I mean
B	nice little
A	pedestrian
B	pedestrian coverway
A	oh we could get an ice cream and eat it on the way look there's the
B	where? oh yes
A	yes there look if we were cycling we would be on here
B	yes
B	not much room for pedestrians
A	that would be fun
B	and cyclists
A	there is just here though except the benches are taking up a lot of room
B	look how fast the Clipper's going
A	oh my god yeah so er I actually didn't think they still ran on a Sunday at this point
B	is that a
A	yes it is but they might just be going back as in no passengers
B	no
A	though they do go quite fast though
B	who owns the land
A	well they're not hoardings aren't they
B	darling? gonna build on it
A	yeah that would be a shame but at least they've erm allowed the people to walk past and not just erm hogged the waterfront for the people with
B	that's how bare north
A	sorry?
B	look how bare
B	north
A	there's not a lot no
B	I suppose of Berkeley Homes could have bought you know
A	I mean I think they'd buy everything if they could
B	land there they could have been anywhere couldn't they?
A	now that this is new here we go oh it's a little bit oh look a beach
B	uhu
A	how do you get down to that?
B	oh oh that scared me
A	you can get down to that somehow surely
B	it's a lovely sound
A	I bet there's some clay pipes there
B	so look we've never seen this side of this
A	no
B	this er
A	okay erm I think we once met someone in the
B	did you talk to them?
A	mm well I think
B	look at that one there what a lovely er
A	and I was there
B	lovely erm
A	view
B	view

A	well reality's not good enough
B	there's another beach darling
A	oh wow
B	there aren't cuddles
A	look no you go along there up there
B	you can climb down to it but I don't think you're supposed to

B	handkerchief on my head
A	and a deckchair
B	and a deckchair
A	and and erm a windbreak
B	a windbreak
A	we used to have all the paraphernalia when

B	quivocal
A	quivocal
B	equivocal
A	so
A	I know
B	look in the Thames oh look at this
A	it's further south but
B	oh darling I like this
A	oh look
A	that's perfect for you it's a cannonball
B	we'd fire on that boat
B	with its
A	aren't they enormous
B	it swivels round
A	it's so big
B	it's real
A	look there's another real one there
B	it's a little fort is what this is darling a little fort
A	look here's some look darling notices
B	yes that means we're there
A	Thames Path we're heading for it National Trail
B	half a mile
A	what's the
B	well we didn't notice it did we strangely?
A	I did not notice it
A	what
B	to cross the river
A	well exactly but
B	well actually I think it's it's just behind those statues in the royal
A	yeah I've never seen it open though
B	I'm not sure if it's actually open
A	exactly I've never seen it
B	yay
A	yeah
B	if we spot one?
A	I don't know when that's gonna be though
B	right are we allowed to go on here though?
A	well we we are heading for the Thames path so I would say
B	Jubilee greenway was built this was build this little bit here was built
A	at the Jubilee?
B	does it remind you
A	yeah it does cos that's what I liked about
B	built in the Jubilee darling
A	more signposts
A	so we've probably only walked about a quarter of a mile so in fact to get to
B	just as well we had our little chocolate
A	yes
B	snack darling
A	that was delicious
B	speaking of which I can put it in this bin that we're coming up to
A	I'm going to get a tan
B	I went to school with
A	what?
B	the grandson
A	did you?
B	and my sister went to school with the heiress of
A	how funny has it got anything to do with the
B	may well do actually
A	cos erm
B	may very well do have to look at up darling
A	yeah
B	look at that bird in the sky
A	no sign of a pub yet I'm already getting tired
B	what are these properties strange look there's that big thing we pass in the car the chimney there
A	is that the one your mum always asks
B	yes
A	what is it? I don't know
B	it's it's for sale
A	what is that?
B	well what would they do
A	what
B	with it
A	what do they how many bricks has it got?
B	ah
A	ah
A	of City airport
B	ah
B	she did ask how many bricks are in the Berkeley development
A	yeah but you just
B	then I just say and answer and
A	yeah
B	you tell me off
A	no but I know but on the other hand she just doesn't need to know these things and it when she asks so who's that and you know it's not gonna mean anything to her so you might as well say oh it's erm it's Patrick
B	the third junior
B	now we're coming up to that erm that really nice art deco building yeah there it is there just beyond the barrier
A	er
B	but behind it they're building a massive new development which will absolutely
A	no I can't see the art deco development I can see a new development
B	it's just in front of that
A	oh I know yeah
B	you can't really make it out to be honest but it's the sort of place they'd film Poirot
A	well they'd film Poirot in the old Co-op building
A	could you erm hold that for a moment I'm going to do my thingy up
B	there's a plane coming in to land
A	it it would be useful to know what we are looking out on when we're looking out of our window because I have been asked that question
B	it's that way
A	a few times
B	it's miles it's towards
A	okay well I'll just say
B	er darling where
A	when people ask what what we're
B	where do we go look?
A	oh er?
B	er?
A	er?
B	we were never told to go somewhere else
A	this is most irregular they didn't say
B	Thames path we go through
A	there's a gate
B	can't possibly go through there can we?
A	looks like a private
B	look this is trodden
A	yeah oh ah this is someone's front the flats' front garden
B	that this there's
A	yeah
B	obvious signs of bicycles
A	people not knowing where to go next
B	well assuming this isn't a
A	oh
B	gated community
A	did we miss the latest
B	well why didn't they build a little thing there in the Jubilee?
A	yeah well because the problem is it's very disjointed isn't it?
A	it does
B	now we have to have our wits about us now
A	yeah
B	what direction we're walking
A	well if we just keep heading to the right and we know that the Thames is behind us
B	must be funny to have a little house here
A	so if we keep the north behind us
B	yes you see you're getting it now darling
B	sort of
A	yeah still I still don't understand when and you're okay the thing that traumatises me that man on Hampstead Heath that got annoyed with me
B	it's a dead end
A	cos I didn't I couldn't answer him
B	it's a dead end
A	er? that's bizarre
B	people having barbeques
A	yeah why not?
B	well that's just silly gotta walk all the way up to to the the main road now
A	there's a signpost there
B	I guess that was the Thames path going in to go up there
A	oh maybe we were meant to go on this as you say and missed a bit but it looks like that sort of signpost that tells you about the Thames path
B	it does the blue ones
A	yes they're alright actually
B	people love owning cars don't they?
A	I know I don't get it why did we miss the whole car culture thing?
B	well if we moved to Campbelltown
A	well the thing is I wouldn't mind learning just so that
B	darling there are two anglers
A	and the A2 blah blah blah blah and the junction blah blah blah blah I haven't got a clue what they're going on about
B	you tell me off when I tease
A	and your mum
B	about that as well
A	comes and talks at me as if I know
B	junction sixteen
A	what she's going on about which is one thing that annoys me
B	but then you do what I do and you tease
A	yeah yeah but not exactly I just let
B	Thames path Thames barrier
A	are you sure?
B	that's what it says
A	okay that's a nice building
B	we're going to come up behind that budget B and M shop and I think Currys Digital darling do you want to look at ovens?
A	er
B	it is nice
A	preserving my hands from age spots
B	sorry darling
A	so
B	well
A	no I think what a shame that's just stupid because all it takes is a tiny little bridge or a bit of path to build
A	if it was open
B	yeah
A	oh is that that tumbledown
B	on the
A	pub? oh look there's
B	yes
A	a Mcdonald's
B	oh that's that's another thing we never
A	what bouldering?
B	that I mentioned earlier
A	no mention it again
B	the climbing
A	oh yes
B	place
A	oh I feel like I'm on holiday when you walk for ages and you get a bit hot
B	you're not inclined?
A	I am not
B	oh good
A	that's not where I had envisaged spending a Sunday
B	in the riverside Mcdonald's
B	root beer
A	no so
B	do they still sell root beer? or is that a nineties thing?
A	what I am wanting is a nice riverside pub
B	there's still not
A	can we get back down to it?
B	no
A	oh fucking hell
A	oh right yeah what are they calling an interim route?
A	er not the
B	refuse
A	and refuse
A	so at least it might offer some protection although I'm very dubious about sun protection factors anyway I'm not sure they do anything
B	pub
A	we don't wanna go to that one but we're if we were doing a
A	pub crawl that would be one
B	we could go to the
A	yeah
B	get a room
A	I would like a toilet break soon
A	that's not fair that's immoral blocking the path
B	yeah the
A	yeah it's beautiful
B	there's a church
A	and a park we've never been there but I want to get back to this
B	well hopefully we turn right at the
A	yeah
B	oh no it's
A	quite hot now
B	well what's in the
A	looks quite nice kept those gardens
B	find out what it's called that might be the ecology
A	it could be er there's some green signposts that would say but
B	no it can't be cos the ecology is er sort of off the river
B	technical college
A	yay information centre view café there's a view café
B	that's called
A	yeah it'll be anonymised anyway
B	don't see why
A	well that's a very specific one could look it up if one was really wanting to know
B	to retrace our walk
A	and where we are but er er we've got no money so if anyone wants to
B	pub
A	erm we're not millionaires I wish we were
B	lovely the coppiced tree darling
A	yeah I was just admiring it this is quite nice
B	I wonder when that was done
A	look daffodils
B	daffodils
A	it is pretty now so I think that they've at least tried because obviously from the
B	well is what would have been a pub one day on the river
A	yeah or what might still be a pub
B	is now
A	on the river
A	ah
A	what have you been doing
B	sweet
A	hello
B	probably a lot in there at the moment
A	now we've walked into the car park oh it seems to be leading us this way which is a bit odd
B	also why that it's still calling itself the interim
A	mm
B	path
A	it's quite pretty though
B	I think your daddy would have liked looking at the
A	oh yes
B	no
A	don't know
B	was she interested in anything?
A	erm probably liked Grantchester
A	mm dunno ah
B	Rosemary and Thyme
A	anything sort of
B	as
A	yes I like programmes for retired people
B	there you go
A	where's the Thames? there's another blue
B	there's the next there's a pond
A	oh sweet
B	Thame cycle route
A	Thames path extension interim route and National Trust via Green Chain walk
B	come on dear
A	coming getting tired
B	mm
A	well the thing is it wouldn't be as tiring if they didn't make us go on that circuitous
B	stupid
B	yeah
A	circuitous route
B	yes
A	and you you're very aware that that's what's happening
B	that's a circular walk we're
A	yeah
B	we're not doing that
A	no the view café
B	there's the cable car and there's the Dome
A	I can't see the cable car
B	it's that pillar
A	oh I can see the oh yes I see it
B	how long that took just to go along
A	yeah
B	cos we were opposite the factory when we left the river
A	yeah that was about
B	silly
A	half an hour wasn't it?
B	I might complain to the council
A	yeah
B	shall we try and get right over or lag behind? like to be on our own
A	yes
B	how long have we been walking now dear?
A	well er we've been recording for
B	look these are flood levels
A	forty-seven minutes
B	and then maybe a light lunch
A	yeah
B	this looks like the Barbican
A	but our battery's doing ever so well
B	I meant I just meant this little walkway
A	brutalist architecture oh yes it is I think
B	now I can't see any reason why there shouldn't be a pub
A	yeah
B	around these parts
A	exactly it's a it's a scandal if there isn't
B	it's in good nick isn't it?
A	to not put a pub here it's it's excellent erm it's such an impressive structure it's beautiful as well
B	it's Ken Livingstone when he was er er
A	I thought it was sixties though
B	no it came out of the er
A	oh
B	that has a
A	I guess if you wanted to you could get the bus that drops you off
B	yeah
A	hereish
B	yeah
A	I wonder what number that would be er as if we were going to Charlton the bus back the same one as we get to Charlton
B	there's the art deco building darling directly opposite us that stepped building with the circular
A	oh yeah
B	tower
A	oh it's nice
B	and then everything to the left has just been built within the last
A	yeah
B	twelve months there was nothing there before I used to look out and you'd see foxes running coming across it
A	foxes?
B	when there was nothing there just wasteland
A	what what did you look out at from where?
B	from the DLR
A	where's the DLR?
B	goes straight past that building
A	is it that side? yeah cos it's crossed the Thames hasn't it so it's actually on the north side of the Thames
B	what was your question?
A	the DLR runs on the north side of the Thames
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh dear a little boy's football there
A	ah
B	look here there's an industrial
A	oh look there's a Clipper it is running
B	what darling?
A	the Clipper
B	yeah there's another one
A	oh yeah
B	look darling that's still a functioning something or other
B	the cement works
A	a whatsit a doobry a thingamajig
B	it's a cement works
A	erm that's on our left the cement works and on our right we have a functioning thingamajig
B	I wonder what flats are like in that circular tower
A	mm very nice I would imagine
B	I did suggest we pack a sandwich
A	yeah
B	wouldn't mind walking along that bit
A	so the thing is we could walk to
B	yeah
A	cos that would we'd have to cross somehow
B	yeah
A	where would be cross? we'd have to get the cable car oh weird that it's over there that now is that cos it's gonna curve round?
B	yeah that's the peninsula because the the the the Dome is on this side of the river
A	yeah it is it really looks strange doesn't it? it looks like it's on the other side very curvaceous river the river Thames
B	I don't think you mean curvaceous
A	I mean er curving not curvaceous curvaceous isn't that far away from what I mean
B	well meandering
A	well yeah meandering can refer to lots of things
B	it's like
A	right do you think we'll find a pub here?
B	that should be a pub directly
A	should be
B	in front of us there
A	if there was any justice that would be a pub but I don't think it is I think it's flats
A	noise
B	that's noisy
A	so that looks like a pub something
B	oh
A	oh there you go
B	yeah
A	yay we've reached our first landmark I can have a loo break and you can have a beer break I might even have a beer
B	I showed you a picture of this do you remember? cos the that little turret on top
A	no
B	this morning
A	right so now we know next time I suggest well we'll know for next time I think probably we'd get that bus that goes to
B	yeah get off at that pub
