A	sorry sorry
B	em yeah you know where the
A	it's underground
B	under
A	yeah it's got a basement is the
C	oh yeah yeah

A	she drew all of the
B	something like that
A	it's sort of the private function room with a bar wasn't it? A sort of little private area
C	wow they must have spent quite a lot of money
A	and all this sort of stuff
C	mm
A	that they basically use it as a sort of storage base
B	yeah cos they've got eh they've got a couple of cars haven't they? But they park them out the front
A	yeah
B	well you can always convert them you know over time
A	yeah
B	it is yea
A	but it's a bungalow
B	planning permission
A	planning permission to convert it don't you?
B	yeah
A	yeah they have yeah
B	mm
A	but it is a bit out in the wilds
C	yeah you'd have to drive everywhere
B	yeah it's it's literally it's on a  it's on a  main road and there's only three houses
C	there's not even like a local shop
A	nothing
B	no there's nothing there at all
A	the nearest is
A	but
B	but every time we go down there we always end up driving past it and have to come turn around and come back again
A	yeah it's one of those where the entrance is it's all sort of hedge and everything all along there and then the entrance is like in it
B	he built some reflectors don't he? Outside to try and help people fine it but no
A	so when you're going down there you sort of you go ah there it was damn it
B	so every time we go down there
A	well no thankfully
B	it's like some sort of farmer's front gate or sommat
A	yeah there's a
B	and then as we're coming back again it's like we're right wait for it  wait for it  is it coming? Very soon
A	well it's easy  it's easy  to see that coming that was it's easier to see isn't it? But eh
B	I don't know is it?
A	but eh yeah it is yeah
B	I always miss it
A	Cos I can always see the house first whereas you come the other way and it's not till you're already passed it that you can see the house cos if the way it is
C	it sounds nice
A	well I mean here renting
B	we got a deal on this place
A	was was
B	we were lucky

C	and you've got a three bedroom house
A	yeah
C	nice

C	but you can't cycle from here can you? Into town
A	you've tried it haven't you?
B	not oh god no
C	you nearly died

C	mm
B	and I'd gone up through
A	Cos the the only way
B	and when you come out on to the main road at
A	yeah
C	yeah that's the thing
A	unless you want to ride on the A14
C	through the villages
B	through the sticks yeah
A	but there's a there is  there is  a cycle path isn't there with with a little lit up cycle path but it doesn't come all the way round
B	oh I don't know
A	yeah you can use that yeah
B	like they tarmacked it
A	there's there is a cycle path that goes out I think it goes out somewhere near
B	yeah I was
C	yeah I think
A	the best thing to do is to go to you know where
C	no
A	I was just going to name a pub in town actually
C	oh yeah well I night know that
A	em
B	yeah he's just about to name a pub that he can't remember what the name of the pub is
C	and it's also changed names
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	well that's where I live
A	so what's the pub
C	the
C	yeah that's closed
A	is it really?
C	yeah
A	oh no
C	all of the locals blame it on the gypsies
A	not because it's a pub but from there there's a cycle path that goes out all the way out to
C	goes past
A	yeah but what's the? What's where the train station is?
C	ah nice
A	so I know there's a few guys a couple of guys who actually work for the council that live there and cycle in all the way down into
C	really from
A	yeah
A	really?
C	iIt would have been nice mum used to live in the black house on the river which is also known as the X files house apparently
A	alright
C	em
A	there's loads of places out here up for rent now
C	I know it's just  it's just  the em having to rely on the bus
A	well it's not that bad
C	it's my dad's car
A	yeah
C	but it's my dad's car
A	you'll probably find out that the money you could save you'd probably be able to run a car anyway
C	yeah
A	Cos it made a
C	really?
A	yeah less council tax
C	how's that? Oh council tax yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	that's good
A	I mean  I mean  the silly thing is as well for me for the car
C	nice
A	to get down there
C	I
B	what's that road?
C	mm
A	and to get out from there it eh
C	yeah you just get jams don't you that's the thing
A	I suppose where you are at the minute you are quite close out to the fourteen aren't you?
C	yeah it's a really good location I'm in at the moment
A	you've got places like
A	no cos it's all new
C	yeah
A	but em
C	yeah it's it's I need to look into it really

C	I really wanted the iPhone but when I cancelled cos I me
A	yeah
C	yeah it was really exciting yeah
A	really?
C	when I called someone it was fine on my end but there was a really bad echo on theirs
A	yeah and I'll send it to you
C	and I said ah that never arrived
A	yeah that would be fine thank you very much
C	so I couldn't use the phone for the first month
A	well the thing I always say about this you know
C	absolutely yeah
A	yeah we've transferred over to Virgin now for our phone and broadband and everything
C	oh yeah
A	and I'll be honest and say that while occasionally it ends up grinding to a halt and just being silly it's ten times better normally than BT ever was
C	really?
A	and eh yeah customer service is a little bit hit and miss whereas BT you might as well not have bothered phoning them
B	eh I think it was Wednesday actually
A	was it?
B	Cos they said about
A	oh that was it yeah and it had gone got completely there was nothing
B	no it couldn't have been Tuesday
A	it was Monday
B	wasn't it? So it was Tuesday
A	Tuesday
C	I hate it when they get silent
A	hello who's there? Oh yes oh right okay
C	mm
A	well that's when the next
B	no what it was darling was there was an automated voicemail that they left on the phone
A	yeah the voicemail thing
B	saying
A	the way  The way  they figure out as to whether there's a network error is if once it gets passed a threshold number of complaints
C	oh right
A	and then it's there's a problem with the network and they have to send someone out to look at the network
C	okay
A	so obviously ours was one of the first calls rather them one of the later ones where they could have just said yeah it's a network problem it will come back on when it comes back on sort of thing
C	how long were you without it?
A	oh like a day in the end
C	it's annoying though isn't it?
A	no they're a lot lot better
B	yeah we are yeah we're paying for that anyway
A	yeah we're paying yeah we're paying for twenty but we're getting thirty
C	wow
A	em but with BT which is using the same stuff we were getting lie one or two at most
C	they do say Virgin is the best yeah
A	yeah
C	bloody hell
A	I think it's just that do you know what I mean? The stuff can always take it but they've sort of drip feed it out really to show that they you know people would buy better each time sort of thing
C	they want us to pay for it
A	yeah
C	ah hilarious
A	well we were talking about it last night weren't we? That you need to start eh
B	there's lots of talking going on
A	you need to start booking some viewings
B	and lots of ordering going on
C	ah
A	that's it
B	it is a bit like that
A	you don't reckon you're going to need to work now are you?
B	well I do need to work
A	well there's other people at work
B	there was two
A	no
B	whereas
C	really? And it's  And it's  their department that's kicking off?
B	it's it's them
C	so what's going on? Why is it so busy?
B	because originally the vocational qualifications of historical records was based in Coventry
C	right so where are they now?
B	so we had two weeks' worth of training in November before they were officially closed down and made either redundant or seconded
A	those weren't the words you used the other day
B	well I it was the kindest words
C	mm
B	em
C	mm
B	I was like Jesus
C	mm
B	about how the stats were crap
C	yeah
B	so I'm now working longer hours and longer days
A	yeah
B	Cos I was unpaid
A	yeah that that
C	oh really well no that's not on
A	yeah that's what I was grumbling about
B	yeah
A	and especially as you told me you were getting it
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	when I was working on VQ as overtime that was overtime
A	mm
B	it's just like it office politics is bollocks
C	mm
B	because it was  it was  a case of if I wanted to finish at five but then do extra time if I did VQ I'd be paid for it if I did  I wouldn't
C	mm
B	and eh it was  that was suffering because I was having to do VQ if I wanted to be paid
C	God that's weird though
B	so I went go bollocks to that then
C	what is the point of
B	just generally in life I don't know
C	Cos is he helping at all?
B	he's trying to but he's he's obviously managing me and
C	mm
B	em ad he'll
C	right
B	and I I
C	he's got no concept of how busy you are
B	my mentality is is generally to be rude
C	mm
B	em but sometimes it's it's it's he'll start passing things over to me
C	oh right
B	he'll slop a bit of paper over it
C	mm
B	we're in the
C	mm
B	we've got half of the team that was left come own with a cold
C	mm
B	and then of course half of those guys that were had a cold were not coming in cos they were sick
C	mm
B	em
C	oh right
B	so there was that there was me
C	oh really? mm
B	and eh yeah it's been a nightmare
C	mm
B	em and he'll say oh there's an MIR in
C	he's a horror isn't he?
B	yeah
C	he only really liked doing the interesting ones the difficult ones
B	mm
C	you know he would cherry pick
B	mm
C	the ones that he wanted to do
A	just a thought
B	I have already kind of asked if she's allergic to anything
A	oh okay

B	there was
C	mm
B	Cos I had the Phili cookbook
A	yeah there was a Phili cookbook and
B	phili cookbook and I went absolutely mental for Phili
A	the only reason you don't like instruction is cos they are not detailed enough
B	is he calling me stupid?
A	yeah pretty much yeah
B	no it's cos if it  if it  doesn't say exactly the way to like turn the spoon over to do something
B	anyway and then after that

A	yeah
B	em there's a whacking great banner that for first of April eh April fools day so I don't think I'm actually going to do with it
A	ah right okay
B	oh April fool's day
A	there we go
B	and I'm assuming it's in in the private school
A	right
B	or on the grounds or
A	somewhere in there
B	somewhere round there
A	Cos we were talking about going to the one in February didn't we but we never went
C	mm
A	pretty much yeah
C	sounds sounds wise
A	I yeah I took the decision early on that no matter I actually said she wouldn't really pay any attention to it unless it was exactly what she was thinking anyway
C	well absolutely
A	so I uh
C	yeah that's more frustrating yeah
A	well that's it
C	so that's fine
C	mm
A	oh right
C	and a wedding in Brighton within two weeks of each other
A	oh my goodness
C	but I I'm quite good now I've just said no to all hen parties
B	what's that?
C	I I've been saying no to all hen parties
B	why?
C	Cos one of them was in em Barcelona for a start
A	right
C	which I think if you're the hen
A	but if you've gone to ten already
C	yes but if it's
A	oh my goodness
C	it the Barcelona trip would have cost four hundred pounds
A	oh really?
C	but luckily my housemate's coming with me and we've sacked off that option
A	oh right yeah yeah
B	mm
C	and she can get employee discount on Holiday Inn's and Crown Plaza's
A	oh good
C	so there's one in Belfast city and we'll get it for nine pounds a night
A	wow
B	nice
C	yeah
A	that's good
C	wicked
A	you left the fridge open
B	I have left the fridge open
A	I did it the other day when I was stood
B	I wonder what it is when you leave the fridge open
A	yeah I was stood there with the door open talking to her yesterday and it wasn't until it started beeping I was like oh I'll shut the door now
B	ah that's what that is
A	yeah
B	oh I don't know
A	it was Barcelona I think wasn't it?
C	this wine's beautiful
B	somewhere sunny
A	and eh we looked at it and oneand obviously
C	yeah
A	the money to go for their wedding it was like bloody hell you know
C	people are so selfish
A	be lovely for your wedding wouldn't it but
C	mm
A	I know yeah
C	yeah absolutely
A	and yeah it would be nice if it was like we were having a holiday anyway
C	mm
A	eh but eh but yeah
C	yeah that's it it is like the cost of a holiday isn't it?
A	yeah
C	excuse me
A	yeah
C	room it's a B and B
A	yeah
C	so
A	no it's something we've had to think about for ours is that obviously most of Hannah's family is sort of
C	far far
A	Scotland
C	yeah
A	and it's kind of you know wherever we pick you know we've got to make sure that there's somewhere everyone can stay that's a reasonable
C	mm
A	price if they want to stop over and things like that and
C	yeah
A	you know so
B	I want to go to eh Hotel Felix
A	Felix that's it
C	mm
A	em for a wedding function there they give you three rooms as part of the three you know three rooms for the night as part of the thing
C	oh okay
A	so my mum went so that would be one room for you or room for me and your dad and one you know like
C	mm
A	but uh
C	nice nice
A	yeah
C	mm
A	really expensive and others where you're getting way more for a lot lot less
C	really? You're noticing a real difference
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	mm that's interesting
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but eh
C	that's really strange
A	I think a lot of it they they do it on the name of the venue and you know they can sort of say oh you know but eh
C	mm
A	yeah
C	even when they do these special nine pound a night things
A	oh yeah
C	you never get it I mean unless you're there during the week
A	the nineteenth of April
C	nineteenth of April
A	twenty-fourteen
C	which is your parents wedding anniversary?
A	yes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and she was waiting for you to guess why it was an important date
A	it was yeah
B	yeah
B	Cos
A	I'm glad it was you on the open to her not me actually cos she would've had a go at me for not remembering
B	yeah cos if it was you she would've she probably would have killed you
A	yeah
B	mm
A	like no
B	oh that's another thing that
C	aw
B	so that could well be that might well be why I managed to get away with it
A	they definitely grumble at me and not at you
B	that's cos they know I'm a sensitive soul
A	Ohh
B	I do yes they are very accommodating
A	whereas me I just get whatever's gong
B	like she'll em most of the time she'll know that
A	oh okay
B	everyone else will have beef or lamb or whatever but she'll get me some chicken
A	yeah
C	is that the only meat that you like?
B	I'm a bit fussy cos I've been kinda
A	if she can get away with it yes it's the only meat that she'll eat
C	mm
B	my mum used to cook it and she used to cook a lot of stews
C	mm
B	cos she would chuck anything in them and did hated them
A	yeah you see that's where the idealized mum because she was she's very good at cooking
B	yeah
A	so our our
B	mm
C	yeah it's not nice
A	it just tastes bad
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah at Christmas
C	tradition
A	and eh me and her always have a competition that we we have to eat the same number of sprouts that the other does
C	right
A	and for years it's always been I I didn't like sprouts and she didn't like sprouts but like like it doesn't fuss me anymore
C	apparently they're nice if you sort of pan fry them and with
A	yeah if they get
C	yeah you can
A	it's a bit late now
C	well this is it
A	yeah but the thing is you've got to have been eating it your whole life
C	exactly
A	sorted
C	never getting cancer
A	I've had my blueberries for a week
B	do you two want another drink?
A	I'm alright
B	no you've got a have one
A	no I'm fine thank you

B	ah do you know what I've had a seriously bad bad experience with fish fingers
C	you haven't?
B	I have?
C	what did you have? What happened?
B	it was disgusting
A	they were em
B	yeah probably rotten more than off
A	no no no
B	you ate them I don't know why?
A	Cos I'm double hard
B	obviously got the stomach for it
A	what it was is they we had no food in so we thought well we'll defrost something from the freezer and we had these fish fingers in there
C	aw
A	eh they didn't smell but they did taste a bit weird
B	they tasted disgusting
A	with
A	whenever something doesn't taste the same as it did the time before hat's it it's the end of that as a food
C	game over
B	yeah the thing is that is really annoying that really annoys me with him is that
C	it's really difficult with frozen foods though because obviously you don't know quite how long it's been there so all the dates are wrong
A	no I I find quite often things like fish don't last very well in the freezer
C	my fish fingers don't have the chance to last till they go off
A	yeah?
C	yeah
A	no I was eh
A	yeah that's cos it's easy
B	yeah well cos he we have like chorizo onion mushroom and he just chucks it all in cooks it all and then just tosses it all together
C	yeah everything in a pan
B	yeah
C	my uncle came cos like my mum's birthday was yesterday

A	well that was why it always used to be good when I was living with
C	I suppose when you go to a restaurant they just give you quite a small amount don't they? I mean in our house there's four girls and one bloke and the bloke is the one who does all the cooking

A	I used to have like cream and I used to wear sunglasses all the time
C	mm
A	really?
C	he had to stand on the playground and everyone else was off playing in the grass

B	mm
A	well yeah when I forget to take them it it get a bit
C	oh my god
B	that's alright

A	yeah I I won  I own  like one or two things
B	yeah extreme needs
C	yeah
B	yes of course you do
A	me? I'm never rude

A	oh so he took the short cut
B	he went  he went  a slightly different way
A	yeah I know where you mean
B	he was taking me through that way
A	well I always used to think that em going out in
C	Taxis man

B	not really
C	it was more flowy
B	well there was em abandoned cars up on the top of the hill again

C	absolutely yeah
A	and eh

C	yeah loads of new roads
A	so so there's going to be a lot of new roads go up
B	more work for you then darling
A	well it will be
B	yeah yeah
A	em but they obviously realised they were going to make too much money out of it so it's it's operated as a toll ever since
C	paid off the builders yeah
A	they've had one the book plans for doing it for so long but there's always been so much protest over what would have to be done cos it goes through so many middle of the nothing places and eh it's been put back and put back and put back and put back
B	if it was poisoned I think the pair of us would be in a lot of trouble
A	we might have keeled over
A	well they were going to build this new town weren't they? Em
B	Don't we go down the A ten to go down to Reading?
A	no the A one

C	oh right
A	it was em a type of housing they call it now
C	affordable housing?
A	no it wasn't  it wasn't  It was something
C	welfare housing
A	but yeah it basically meant it
C	that's bad but that's how they get away with it
A	did you read? There was a thing in the news
C	no way
A	said they wouldn't agree to it
C	mm
A	it was basically they'd they'd done it because it would get them
C	would save them
A	they would have no need to to rely on the national grid anymore
C	that's rubbish
A	I always remember when we built eh the
C	oh yeah yeah
A	and there the guys had planning supposed planning permission there for a development there because he wanted to sell it to eh like Travelodge or something like that
C	oh charming
A	some of its  Some of its  quite new but

A	yeah it was back then wannit? Basically they I mean they live in basically council housing
B	surviving the weather of course
A	yeah it was very much you know survival style housing sort of thing
B	well from what I spoke
C	I know
B	well
C	can you farm? Is there farming?
B	there's a bit of farm land up there
C	mm
B	there's a  There's a  forest down the road from mum's old place isn't there
C	there's very very little
B	there are lo lots of sheep
A	I can't  I can't  imagine what the next generation up there would do if they would not leave
B	yeah I don't know what Charlie's going to do when she grows up yeah
A	you know because there's literally nothing
B	although
C	right
B	and Em
A	well it's an oil terminal isn't it?
B	yeah oil terminal yeah
A	basically in between all the islands is the oil terminal
C	right
A	and eh
B	when when you're sailing in and out on the  on the  mainland ferry on the actual ferry you actually go past it and you've always get the you know you know it's there because they they light the flare and em the fire goes up and
A	obviously the only way to get to it is by boat
B	dingy
A	dozen man
C	and do they have to be based on that
A	yeah and there' slots lots of people work on it
B	it's the only employee well
A	employers yeah
B	yeah man employee
A	farm farming only takes you know only covers employment for a very small
B	and then of course there's the people that rely on tourism
A	yeah it must be hard in the winter months
B	mm
A	yeah finally

A	Harris is not
C	Harris
A	yeah
C	so it's you would go I think you'd get the train up to sky you get the train to Skye or is Skye an island?
A	Skye is an island
C	so you get the train up somewhere the you have to go up to Skye by boat and then from there you have to go to Harris and then from Harris
A	that's why you call it the Isle of Skye
C	and then from Harris
B	oh god
C	and what you were saying about you know the next generation moving away
B	mm
C	Cos they haven't got anything there themselves they have to import everything
A	well it's like I was saying for me there'd be absolutely nothing for me to do work wise
B	no not even
A	there's so  There's so  few people the building that goes on there is the very very bare minimum
B	even the original roads that they built are still like new
A	yeah
B	I don't know how many
A	it's certainly declined from what it used to be
C	what made your mum live there?

A	yeah unfortunately your nan where as a people get older or some of them anyway the the sort of wiring in their brain starts to decay a little bit and she's turned into
B	A monster
A	a horrible old harridan who absolutely torments your granddad
B	the one thing that she was doing was shortly after I moved up there and obviously shortly after they'd had this accident
A	when we first went up there and eh
B	nan's always been civilised to us though hasn't she? She's been
A	yeah but even first time I'd met them and you hadn't seen them for years
B	oh her own
A	couldn't couldn't care whether you were in the room or not kind of thing
C	God
A	and eh was couldn't get us out of the door fast enough relay could she?
B	no I mean
A	yeah he's basically just got sort of his vision is down to like
B	A sliver
A	a little slither across his vision
C	ah bless
B	and it's getting worse and my nan treats him like a bloody dog
C	really?
B	and a slave yeah
C	he has to make the dinner and he can't even see
B	yeah I mean my granddad
A	it's even worse cos he used to be em he used to be like a graphic designer so you know everything was with his eyes and he does well he still does but he used to be you know do a lot of photography and things like that so obviously a lot of what was his life is obviously virtually gone
C	yeah
A	so but it's very hard
C	right
A	so I mean for me I would always you know you get you know you're isolated already cos of your age and your frailty and if it's always bad weather or it always seems like it's bad weather and you know it must get quite depressing for them I would of thought I mean when we went when we first went up there foolishly I went first in January
B	I'm not up for
A	we went to eh Skara Brae didn't we? And you stayed in the car cos it was too cold

B	it was better
A	yeah em but eh
C	mm
A	ah but
C	I'm sure it is
A	but the weather I mean it is just battered off the North Sea
C	I'd quite like it if we could invent teleportation
A	to go for a visit and then
C	to go for a visit
A	that's the thing so far you don't really know what's it like till you get there
C	it's like the jungle
