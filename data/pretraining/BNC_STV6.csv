A	erm this guy who had kind of
B	mm
A	and so
B	right
A	and he started thinking about it and he was thinking about how humans aren't really connected to the earth they're not connected to the ground
B	mm
A	like they used to be yeah because you walk around with shoes that are insulated erm and that you drive places that you are in buildings yeah
B	mm mm
A	so your body your feet don't really touch the ground yeah they're insulated from the ground
B	oh
A	so what he did was he erm
B	mm
A	which he called a grounding mat yeah so this thing
B	mm
A	because your body is inflamed it is giving off heat around these sites yeah
B	yeah
A	so they simply had one of those coloured
B	like infrared or something
A	those colour vision type
B	mm
A	matches
B	mm mm
A	of erm how people look after having
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	erm and it made me think
B	mm
A	and we slept on the ground
B	yeah
A	like you know swag and stuff
B	yeah
A	and we were a lot closer to that and I
B	mm
A	yeah even though it was not in a bed
B	mm
A	not in a house all of that kind of stuff right
B	mm yeah
A	so it made me wonder whether there was kind of a connection in that
B	mm
A	the idea of just simply
B	mm yeah I mean we used to do a lot of beach walking
A	mm
B	didn't we? so
A	take your shoes off
B	yeah erm
A	mm
B	because we really weren't really very near electricity quite a lot of the time you know
A	yeah
B	because we were well away from houses and buildings
A	it's an interesting thought innit?
B	mm it is yeah it is and especially what
A	mm
B	there is like some kind of low level hum
A	mm mm
B	of these erm you know machines
A	appliances
B	well appliances yeah left on
A	mm mm
B	and those Sky boxes
A	yeah
B	erm and I think it would be interesting if you just turned everything off and got into a habit of not really having anything on standby
A	you don't need it on at night time
B	no
A	erm you just turn it off at the wall
B	well dad used to have this thing when you know when mum was alive that she had so many different appliances in the living room stacked on top of each other
A	mm
B	that he'd actually have you know programmed for it for everything to switch off at night
A	mm
B	no no standby I don't know what happened to that idea erm I will have to ask him but yeah I mean I think it really helped not having anything electrical in your bedroom while you're sleeping
A	yeah
B	but I still think yeah I think there are in a way too many appliances in this house that
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah it is interesting that I hadn't thought of it
B	mm
A	but even I wonder if you just kind of got into the habit of not erm
B	mm
A	and when you are outside when it is like warm enough and that just down on the grass
B	mm
A	if you are at home and that
B	mm
A	and so you just kind of
B	mm yeah
A	I wonder what that is?
B	a plane
A	don't you think it sounds like an old plane?
B	mm
A	yeah it is nice
B	mm
A	it is only like a couple of weeks ago the shadow was back close to the house so there was a lot more lawn to lie around on
B	mm
A	and now it is just like well half of it
B	I know the clocks go whatever backwards forwards twenty-sixth October I think
A	oh there's another whole month
B	mm
A	wow
B	yeah
A	okay
B	mm well even just after
A	mm yeah okay so it is not too much to worry about time-wise at the moment
A	that was charming
B	it could have been a lot worse
A	a Frenchman would be proud of you
B	yeah the Japanese or Chinese or something like that
A	yeah
B	erm I got quite lost actually going into
A	mm
B	then there's this roundabout it looked like it was the
A	mm
B	so I took some kind of road called
A	uh huh
B	that's sort of around the backs of the backs
A	yeah
B	and that's actually where all the schools are so I got completely and utterly clogged through
A	oh
B	and then I came up to this other road and it was quite a good road because it is the road where
A	okay
B	so what I did is I arrived at half past four paid my fifty P for thirty minutes and that was it for the whole night I only paid fifty P for parking and all I had to do was then walk past you know where we went to the solicitor and the
A	yeah
B	I just walked down that hillish thing
A	and then it is straight down
B	and straight down into town
A	mm
B	okay you know it's about a ten minute walk
A	mm mm
B	it was quite straightforward though
A	it is not too far down to the
B	not at all
A	on
B	so that's kind of quite a good little spot so anyway I was coming home at night and I just thought oh I will just drive right up that road erm thinking that I was gonna be on
A	oh
B	oh my god and then I saw this erm sign for the
A	yes
A	mm mm
B	I'll  go off there thankfully I kind of managed to figure out that I needed to move towards
A	mm
B	and then from
A	so you came round that way
B	so I came really on the back roads
A	yeah okay
B	but it was a little kind of strange not really feeling like
A	you knew where you were going
B	is this gonna work out?
A	so you could have also erm headed back into town if you come past the
B	yeah that's where I thought I was going to be but I actually looked at the map
A	it's a biplane
B	ah
A	I hope he is not going to erm kind of conk out like the other one did the other day
B	that would be fun wouldn't it? we should make some friends with some pilots at
A	yeah okay
B	and I think on a on a on a not not at the school you know picky uppy time it's actually fine
A	going in on the
B	yeah I think it is it is just you have got to pick your time
A	mm mm mm
B	but it is quite good to know that erm
A	mm
B	and I think that's great because otherwise I've been parking in the
A	and you've still got
B	no I think he's a different
A	mm
B	having fun over there
A	he's kind of a noisier one
B	mm
B	its funny how they do that isn't it?
A	wow he's kind of going down straight into the ground
B	I know
A	I hope he's gonna pull up
B	oh look he is look oh look he's doing an acrobat look there you go yeah
A	is he doing a circle loop the loop?
B	yeah well he did one of those uppy downy ones
B	mm
A	that's fine stay out here
B	mm it's rather lovely
A	you've got the lawnmower brigade on again
B	yeah that's
