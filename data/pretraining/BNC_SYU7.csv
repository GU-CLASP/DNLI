A	okay let's start again
B	I don't know if any of the other girls have been out to meet or them all here
A	no
B	have they? I
A	no cos you don't think there's a sense of community here do you unless
B	but they
A	well if you've got baby then yeah
B	no I mean the others with a baby
A	oh
B	where do they go? do they go out and see it
A	oh
B	but then I've been trying to practice my Chinese so it's a bit different to
A	yeah you have to be quite erm bold don't you really?
A	so
B	I'm not usually bold
A	yeah
B	they love it
B	I know
A	all over her
B	no there's only two
A	no she's got her behind her ear as well
B	really?
B	and there's me trying to do her sleep training going just go back to sleep come on
B	oh well we can't put the net up
A	the mosquito net?
B	yeah she was scared
A	well it didn't work when she was a baby like well she's still a baby but
B	she's just gonna be prodding it
A	yeah mm
B	mm
A	but do you think it would be a good thing for her to get used to
B	to get used to a mosquito net?
A	I mean we've only got mosquitos because we left the bathroom window open with the light on
B	yeah
A	and the problem is it let in about four hundred mosquitos
B	yeah we're lucky
A	I think
B	I think we're lucky
A	I think you got most of them in the bath so
B	did you see my god there was loads
A	yeah
B	like the whole bath was just covered like
A	yeah but you know what they're like
B	I've sprayed so much citronella in there now but I hosed them down with hot water like the whole of the shower unit
A	yeah
B	I just sprayed nearly the whole bathroom with hot water
A	but the trouble is the ones that got out of the bathroom and there's bound to be
B	yeah
A	quite a few that are just hidden
B	yeah there was
A	behind cupboards and shit so
B	ah oh wondered what that was there was a big black blob on her leg
A	so we'll find out tonight how many have er
B	oh
A	I won't be out for long I mean we're just gonna go for a meeting
B	oh that's alright I just need you to do a mosquito hunt just before
A	yeah
B	you go if we have time if we have time after this park trip
A	yeah
B	oh I can't get
A	don't think we can get out through there
B	I've gone the wrong way
A	so
B	every week woah it's up to you
A	what do I say to that?
B	well I don't know it's up to you
A	well no it isn't because
B	I say hello to everybody look
B	I don't care
A	no but it does it does matter because
B	well no but it's up to you
A	and if
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	well that'll be alright
A	then I'm more obliged well not obliged but I'd I'd like to do it more
B	well if it's do people smoke in
A	yeah
B	but I could come
A	you
B	too late for
A	yeah if if you could get a babysitter you could come and watch us
B	yeah then I don't mind getting paid with free cocktails I could just
A	yeah cos we'd probably get free drinks as well
B	get make sure that the nanny comes early in the morning oh you it would be at the weekend won't it?
A	erm the last two that we've done there have been on a Friday
B	yeah but I can't get really drunk and then just get the nanny to come
B	and stay babysit her on the night and then
A	mm well I don't think it's really that kind of venue anyway it's more kind of finish at
B	yeah
A	it's only cos like it got a bit out of hand last time
B	yeah
A	because they said free cocktails and
B	well I don't think if if
A	we got smashed
B	that's what happened I don't think they'll do it again will they?
A	well I don't think so no
B	you lost half the stuff you took with you
A	yeah well I lost my memory
B	no well that's I remember that
A	no I don't wanna do that
B	I don't but I didn't like that
A	so I'm you know if they say
A	we want you to play
B	you don't even know what you're doing
A	we give you free drinks then I'm not that
B	no
A	bothered
A	but if they can give us a percentage of what they take at the bar or something
B	what what the takings minus
A	cos then we can try and
B	how much the drinks cost?
A	yeah cos that's what they did in the the other bar that they were playing before
B	yeah
A	no they gave them like twenty percent of what they took at the bar
B	what without taking out the cost of the drinks?
A	drinks for who?
B	how does that work? no the drinks that the bar buys bottles and that the bar buys
A	oh I I don't know
B	the cost price just the profits
A	well the profit okay the ten percent of the profit they make
B	oh I wonder how much
A	so
B	a bar makes in profit
A	we could arrange I dunno
B	no er
A	if we could arrange some kind of deal like that
B	yeah yeah
A	because we bring along a load of people
B	yeah
A	like to
B	like your groupies
A	not groupies but our our friends as well
B	which way do we are we waiting for this one?
A	yeah this way
A	oh I dunno let's find out what he says anyway
B	bring your groupies
A	no you're not got a few groupies I suppose
A	in the Alan Partridge kind of sense
B	you're a little baby
A	how many cranes can you see?
B	well I can't even count them
A	there's hundreds okay
B	are we ready to go?
A	yeah
B	oh did you email
A	no I didn't
B	right
A	it will be easier just to say it them I think
B	yeah
A	than a really long email
B	well
A	don't know when I'll I'll see
B	did you check the meeting time?
A	no
B	are you just relying on me?
A	relying on you
B	cos I wouldn't rely on me if I was you I was hoping to rely on you for it
A	I'll I'll check them later
B	I half do a job and then get distracted and go and do something so
B	like if
B	otherwise I'll look at it and go oh right meeting at ten thirty oh
A	mm
B	cos I think I've read it but I haven't
B	I've only half read it
A	well it's cos playing on a Sunday as well
B	mm oh
A	and so if that takes out Fridays and Sundays
B	so many holes in the road twisting all my ankles
B	then I've only got Saturday at the weekend with you
B	well
A	and if I'm drinking on Friday I well I'll just have to
B	I
A	learn not to drink
B	yeah
B	well
A	waste my Saturdays cos of a hangover
B	but we've got we've got to be able to do some things that's all
A	yeah
B	if we're both gonna be working during
A	mm
B	and go out
A	mm
B	if you've got the band
A	yeah
B	I don't want that to be Saturday cos that could be
A	yeah
B	couldn't we? like a Saturday a nice day we've got a nice day and an evening
A	yeah
B	plus you don't want it every week just what if we want to go to
A	yeah I know that's what I mean
B	like
A	well I suppose there's no point talking about this until I find out exactly what he wants so
B	yeah yeah okay
A	yeah
B	every week what are you gonna say?
A	cos I know the other guys they want as much as possible
B	do they?
A	yeah
B	what if they go away? I'm gonna have to go backwards
A	I'll lift you
B	thanks
A	oh ah
B	if I'd have gone backwards that wouldn't have been the wrong way wouldn't it?
B	right
A	yeah I don't like this road
B	yeah neither do I
A	no it was empty here it was the next one that was the nightmare
B	mm
A	I guess the time is everyone's coming back from work
B	yeah
A	yeah shall we go?
B	oh my god I can't oh my god no don't wait for me don't wait for me please
B	no way I'm no good at crossing roads
A	er
B	I'm such a whinger aren't I? I used to cross here fine all the time
A	no
B	it's just that I'm facing slightly
A	no stop
B	oh god
A	ah
B	oh
A	for fuck's sake
B	that's twice it's no good
A	no
B	a pram jeez and they come so fast don't they?
A	bloody hell
B	right
A	er I think we're okay
A	right next one
B	it's good for the er adrenalin isn't it?
B	like to give you a a bit of a kick you need a bit of
A	stop
B	adrenalin ever so often don't you?
A	yeah
B	like you don't have to go on any
A	well that theme park should open next month
B	I don't need any more jolts
B	good jog to the heart though gets it keeps it healthy doesn't it?
A	well
B	does it? oh it doesn't feel like it right now but once
A	yeah and then that's the last one
B	so but is there not a shortcut to the park here? how big is the
A	well no cos you can't get through that next road up there there's a
B	oh I didn't know
A	yeah cos
B	what that over there?
A	well
B	or over there
A	I don't know how far the next gap is in the road
B	right we'll play it safe today yeah? and then
A	well if we cross there then we can walk down the other side and then we can see
B	yeah but we're going that way
A	yeah but we still have to cross the road
B	oh oh I see okay yeah
B	oh
B	you really wanted to come in the bit of path you were on with our
A	cutting your pram up
A	need a little honker on this pram
B	beep beep
B	yeah
A	erm
B	looks like it
A	there's another one that's just been built
B	the same?
A	no it looks like the Empire State Building
B	oh you're kidding
A	no
A	like a mini version of it
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	no I can't
A	yeah but I think they might be modelling all these
B	before they had all these nice designs
A	I think they might be modelling all these buildings on like different
B	New York
A	oh it is New York
B	a mini New York
A	in
B	right
B	yeah well that's why you think the people are getting in the in our way but it's you they're just a lot slower
A	yeah
B	those bikes those e-bikes are
A	wait wait wait
B	they work pretty well
A	I'm waiting for the red light
B	those those e-bikes are erm
A	two hundred and seventy?
B	but er but I think I think you can get one for about two hundred what do you think?
A	yeah well they had some in Metro
B	yeah oh yeah you were gonna tell me how much
A	like the ones that
B	yeah maybe I'll take her to Metro we can ask her to come and have a look at some
A	but I I don't know what's a good e-bike I suppose the most important
B	well that's why
A	thing is the battery life
B	that's what I said to her I looked at well er with my translator on my
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	look at these buildings
B	but there's a Mcdonald's why I thought you said
A	yeah
B	it was over there
A	no we came out down there and wanted to cross the road down there
B	oh
A	where you've just wanted to cross but you can't
B	yeah I get you now I didn't get it before cos I always thought it was over the other side
A	no
B	I don't even like Mcdonald's so I wouldn't want to
A	no
B	buy a like
A	but after five pints it seemed like a good idea
B	is it twenty-four hour?
A	no it closes at eleven
B	beep beep yeah
A	oh it should get quieter now let's get away from the road
B	I I I'm very very tempted to get an e-bike
A	yeah?
B	yeah yeah
A	have to be careful on it
B	I know
A	yeah yeah
B	I I
A	here
A	go
B	erm
A	it's just not made for pedestrians is it?
B	what the path?
A	erm
B	this is gonna be very nice
A	well they're putting a shitload of money into the area
B	it's all so shiny
A	yeah there's no one here though really is there?
B	well but that will come
A	it's still
B	can I go on this path? are we going this way?
A	er cross over again though
B	why?
A	well cos there's nothing down there
B	that's where we're going
A	huh? that's not the park
B	yeah
A	the park's way over there
B	nah
A	okay let's go down there
B	no
A	come on
B	we'll do it your way
A	yeah do it your way
B	you know that it's fifty fifty however many times you get lost to to me
A	er
B	it is
A	it's like slightly higher than that
B	sixty forty maybe but there's
B	plenty of times where you take me one direction
B	and you're completely wrong
A	yeah
B	but you never remember those ones
B	what's the coffee got like a little it's only got one table outside hasn't it?
A	yeah
B	oh I don't want to go back to work I just want to come like to the coffee shop over there
A	really? I'm quite looking forward to it
B	I've got other things I can do
A	oh yeah so have I but
B	yeah
A	something to do
B	I've got other things
A	oh yeah
B	oh nice teddy bears looks a bit sparse at the moment
A	it's a very random shop thing I think half of these shops are gonna close
A	oh yes we can
B	erm
A	is she dribbling?
B	oh are you hungry?
A	yeah?
B	mm
A	why is she not eating right?
B	don't know she just keeps stopping and looking around and
A	yeah
B	she's just thinking like
A	no
B	just thinking
A	yeah
B	did you see all those babies? they all had socks
A	yeah I know
B	all had like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	right how can we cross?
B	right how do you get over?
A	I dunno
B	there's the park there we are
A	I've no idea
B	I thought you told me I had oh maybe
A	can't even see where our crossing is though
B	what's that big building there?
A	don't know
B	how can we get in?
A	er
B	oh don't fall asleep yet
A	they don't have any of those downward kerb bits do they? oh there's one
B	she'd like that I think
A	yeah
B	no don't fall asleep no she's not she's just thinking about she's I think maybe she's drifting
B	some plastic horses I didn't realise
A	yeah I think they're the same ones they dressed up for Christmas and made them into reindeers
B	what?
B	did they?
A	put some antlers on them
B	no cos they were for year of the horse that wasn't till February
A	oh was it? okay
B	they wouldn't have done that
A	oh that's why they've got horses
A	I don't know
B	they've done the same in the middle of town and in
A	er
B	you're you're right it does kind of hide the river doesn't it a bit actually although look at those children over there there is an entrance up there
A	er
B	there must be a shortcut there must be an exit up that side and it would be
A	that looks like a little road going into it there
B	yeah but on the way back maybe we should try and get to the other side
A	okay
B	and it it would be a shorter trip before you get to the park and start walking
A	yeah
B	you won't have to walk through that whole bit there
A	oh this road's terrible there's no traffic lights on this one
B	oh no
A	I think we just walk don't we?
B	hang on let me go down this slopey bit
B	which way?
A	I dunno but there's a sign saying there's a er
B	no well I mean which way
A	pedestrian crossing
B	which way for the
A	that's okay
B	er? oh I don't know they're pretty
A	er
B	that sun's a little strong isn't it?
A	this is nice
B	oh why don't we live here right next to the park?
A	well it didn't take long to get here really did it?
B	twenty minutes? er
A	twenty?
B	it's a good jogging track isn't it? I mean you could run down no you couldn't really run I dunno run on those main streets? no I could
A	it's a bit tricky
B	like I said if there's an entrance that's closer
A	yeah
B	that might be good
A	well it's a good time of year to go jogging
B	yeah
A	the temperature's about right now
B	oh
A	yeah she looks alright

A	so if we go this way
B	doesn't it?

A	and we can go back that way yeah?
B	yeah
A	erm I don't know
B	it only took us fifteen minutes
A	erm
B	to get down to that bit last time so we could have only been going about forty minutes
