C	well yeah but that's no you know

B	seven hundred for a three-bedroom flat

B	yeah four bedroom detached seven hundred

B	two centimetres from the neighbour
A	generous garden sticker
B	five-bedroom bungalow
A	that's quite a nice kitchen
B	five bedroom detached Northfield Dorking
A	Dorking I've heard of that as well I've heard of these places I don't know why
B	that's erm
A	where is Surrey exactly?
B	Surrey is west of London it's sort of the
A	oh right on to the coast?
B	no no the other side
A	oh I'm not good at west and east
B	it's sort of the prime commuter territory for London
A	Surrey and then is it erm Somerset next?
B	Somerset to the west? well Somerset's actually in the west of England rather than London
A	I understand so there's London Surrey
B	well you've got things like Oxfordshire
A	Lincolnshire oh Oxfordshire yeah
B	Oxfordshire erm what's the one next to it? Staffordshire? Worcestershire
A	oh yeah
B	Warwickshire all of those are between Somerset and Surrey
A	okay quite a fat part the country isn't it?
B	it is
A	mm
B	it is indeed
A	chubby
B	well yes I see what you mean
A	it's not really that much of a consolation
B	no
A	I was just pointing out if you compare here to Chester you have one type of comparison but in terms of the whole country the north east is the cheapest
B	yes I think it is
A	and the north west is the second most cheapest and Chester is probably somewhere in the middle it's not expensive relatively to all of those southern counties
B	not compared with the south no
A	mm so you're still getting a bargain really
B	still on seven hundred on page ten
A	yeah that's the other thing
B	I was trying to go up a little
A	yeah
B	seven two fives here we are seven two five four-bedroomed terrace
A	mm mm mm
B	three-bedroom detached
A	you don't want a terraced house do you?
B	three-bedroom flat two-bedroom flat seven two five
B	it's in Wimbledon
A	oh there you go then erm
B	I believe so
A	central
B	I believe so
A	mm
B	Streatham four-bedroom semi
A	it's the same with rents it's just mad rental prices
B	yeah
A	won't you look up erm
A	most people that I knew who stayed in
B	okay
A	I can't remember their names
B	so do you know erm
A	yeah
B	seven hundred for a six-bedroomed terrace
A	really?
A	it's quite a big road
B	seven two five for a four-bedroom terrace
A	yeah
B	three-bedroom terraced on
A	oh there you go that was where I
B	it's that where you were?
A	yeah let's see that could even be next door that could even be it
B	let's have a look at it then
B	yeah which one is it?
A	let me have a look oh no it's on the other side of the road to us and it's got like a little downstairs bit as well let's see inside
B	oh it's the one with the blue door
A	mm mm like a nicer version of ours though ours was like a bit of a student digs
B	yes a bit studenty
A	it was really lucky to live on that road though even as students
B	gosh well it looks rather nice but it's not worth seven hundred and twenty-five
A	well yeah well it is worth
B	that's a bit like
A	yeah that was like ours
A	yeah it looks like very similar structure that was my room and the there was the bathroom next door
B	yeah incredible
A	crazy
B	looks a bit of a mess
A	that's not really the point no the point is about
B	needs attention yes you're pretty well placed aren't you?
A	you're there aren't you? five minutes from
B	er
A	you're not going to have that much money but and you both worked at the university or something like that
B	right
A	that would be
B	well yes I mean and this is
A	well walk to work
B	this is the thing isn't it? there's no way that you could afford anything like that unless you'd been working for twenty years and you'd been lucky in previous houses because seven hundred thousand is just a huge amount of money
A	well that's the other things isn't it? of course it is erm I guess yeah I guess partly it's people who made wise investments with property as well
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	and others who erm
B	start slide show
A	just had a good job I mean as I said the wages for instance if you work in London in a high position job the wages re extremely high aren't they? not to mention that I think people are willing on average to take out much bigger mortgages than you did
B	I wonder I suppose they have to don't they?
A	I think so and people are not like you're no you're you're debt free which the majority of people simply are far from that
B	it's very old fashioned to be debt free
A	it is old fashioned but it's very wise
B	has its advantages
A	exactly no of course just not
B	we survived anyway
A	yeah of course it's just the not the mentality for most people I think and for the good or for the bad people are paying off their mortgage till the end of their lives you know
B	yeah so point one miles from
A	yeah I know
B	you would know that
A	as students it was perfect you know? I could walk to my lectures cycle could get up at the last minute for my nine o'clock
A	it was I don't think I ever had a nine o'clock actually to be honest being an artsy type
B	mm that's true seven two five three bedroomed terrace of
A	that's funny that it came up it's quite unusual for properties to come up I imagine now I mean the thing with
B	oh is it?
A	and yeah and it's you know people travel that much within London
B	I mean just on the face of it just looking through these I'd say there's a great variation of what you're offered for that price
A	yeah it's all about where it is isn't it?
B	you can get a three-bedroomed terrace you can also get a five-bedroomed detached
A	where though?
B	well I'll tell you in a second here we are
A	oh that's quite nice
B	oh no sorry no that's terraced
B	erm
A	no I mean with
C	did you find your house in
B	this is just amazing because we found one on
C	oh no way
A	we found we found one on
C	of course it was
B	here you are
A	I mean it's better off than the one we lived in in terms of it's in better nick
B	it's seven hundred a twenty-five
C	I know love I know
B	er yeah so here we are there's a five
A	so what about the
B	five-bedroom detached
A	well yeah meaning it's a bit of a hole currently
C	student dive at present
A	no there are there are north of the river there are less nice neighbourhoods in
C	yeah that's right that's the same
A	they're further away from the station
C	and they're just
A	yeah like
C	everything is available yeah
A	not
B	right
C	that's right
A	and twenty minutes or so cycling to the erm
C	how much is that one biff?
B	seven two five
C	yeah would you buy it?
B	no
C	no no
A	go and live in
B	currently a four-bedroom home in a peaceful cul-de-sac within highly regarded
B	I remember the road
A	right in the middle yeah
B	runs past where the
A	it does yeah it goes straight into the centre
B	well blow me
A	have you heard about this?
B	I have actually yeah I didn't know it was called Silicon Fen
A	nor did I
B	ex university people went out you know set themselves up haven't they?
A	start start-ups yeah yeah it's become a bit of a hub for things now Silicon Fen
B	I they have to have an equivalent to valley somewhere don't they?
A	yeah but it just sounds a bit colloquial doesn't it?
B	sounds a bit naff doesn't it?
B	oh yes I saw that
A	it's always those American ones
B	and do you know which is top
A	Harvard usually
B	no
A	MIT?
B	erm yes
A	yeah
B	is it MIT the one in Boston? Massachusetts Institute of Technology
A	is it number one now?
B	number one
A	gosh yeah normally it's Harvard because I don't know why actually it's all a
B	and Oxford Oxford are quite a bit quite a bit lower down
A	slightly arbitrary yeah in the world one I've noticed that never mind
C	right then I'm going to get something for tea
A	it all seems incredibly biased to me when I look at the criteria and stuff
B	yeah
C	erm
A	I just think mm I imagine some of the universities in China are amazing
