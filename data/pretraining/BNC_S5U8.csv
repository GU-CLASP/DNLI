A	it's weird really because
B	yeah
A	and his mum
A	it's like
B	mm
A	I mean the whole thing could just be about
B	I think the hat is a very good bit of it
A	yeah
B	personally
A	it's a shame it's got nothing to do with the rest of the story
B	that's right so the hat's got to be off yes yes I understand
A	yeah
B	erm
A	erm
C	yeah
A	today

B	he's got his hat on
A	he's supposed to supposed to look a bit like he's

C	yeah he looks a bit faded
A	yeah that's the trouble cos I liked having him a bit opaque cos it makes him look a bit
A	I can make him not opaque
B	erm
A	that's okay
B	er in a sense I would leave that page out completely
A	yeah
B	right?
A	mm

B	see my my difficulty is is not seeing it as a whole
A	mm
B	in bits

A	I would
B	mm
A	I'll do it in here
B	but I
A	everyone's
B	right
B	but
A	I kinda wanted to do it as a kind of then I thought oh god I haven't got loads of money to do this
B	mm
A	but if I did a little story
B	yeah
A	of course it costs
B	mm
A	no money to
B	yeah exactly yeah
B	mm
A	more of a personal thing if they've now done it
B	no
A	up with
B	yeah
A	cos I asked erm
B	mm
A	and they they
A	and the kids as well they're like yeah
B	and he did look like a penguin but then
A	oh yeah
B	I got confused but it did look like a penguin
A	no it's actually could be a mole I mean who
B	but it could but I mean does it matter?
B	the
A	yeah
B	if he thinks it's a mole it'll be a mole
A	yeah
B	or if he thinks it's just a funny
B	doesn't matter
A	yeah
B	erm

B	erm
A	mm
B	and having worked with children I would
A	uhu
B	mm
A	well that's nice
B	mm
A	yeah cos I thought I wanted to do them a
B	mm
A	you know cos it's not really quite like a rabbit some of the
B	but it doesn't matter
A	that's right so cos I think you can be so simple can't you with kids?
B	yeah

B	not the adults
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	erm Teletubbies yeah

B	I really wouldn't start
A	no
B	erm
A	did you use
B	no no
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	but I what I want to do at some point
A	yeah
B	instead of saying okay there's my family tree and that's
A	yeah
B	it's just to have little bits of
A	yeah
B	give people
A	yeah
B	er because it's it's

B	what?
B	no it's er just a sort of
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah

A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm

A	yeah
B	that that everybody would be able to
A	yeah
B	in their mind's eye
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	cos it keeps it keeps you

B	but I mean
A	I'm sure she's alright I'm sure she's fine
B	but and she might well be
A	oh
B	but
A	he has he
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	each job
A	yeah
B	and get the whole house
A	yeah
B	now that would've been fine if they were happy
A	mm
B	and then they
A	yeah
B	and rented several houses
A	yeah
B	and then they split up
A	yeah
B	but were still
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but though it's losing money hand over fist but you know?
A	yeah
B	he said look you can
A	mm
B	the shop
A	mm

A	really?
B	on the house yes to her
A	oh god
B	erm
A	god
B	and just just to say to right

B	that's right
A	yeah
B	erm
A	borassic
B	oh oh my god
A	like a Brussels sprout like
B	oh brassica?

A	well
B	really
A	so this is probably the first time in a long time
B	mm
A	she's
B	mm
A	erm where
B	yes yes
A	she's having to
B	yes
A	and she will give out and she will kick off and react probably but
B	mm
A	you know that's that's her business
B	he's given her
A	oh my god much more really
B	you know?
A	and she was wasn't prepared to look after their son for it either
B	and
A	which is
B	and and
A	I'm quite disappointed actually
A	exactly she was like sort of
B	mm
A	he took
B	mm
A	no no wonder he
B	yes
A	it that's what the pressure was like he was absolutely right to leave
B	yes definitely
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but it's a bit like
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	mm
A	and no she'll she'll've been in the same position she'll be able to buy herself a house and be completely rent free or mortgage free
B	unless she goes for something big
A	oh no
B	it's up to her
A	it's up to her yeah it is
B	and she may have to sort of get a hand out of food
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	but also maybe you've
B	mm
A	cos sometimes I've felt very
B	mm
A	cross about it or frustrated but
B	yeah
A	if they've
B	yes
A	I am
B	yes
A	cross and the other people can get bitter and cross
B	mm
A	even though
B	mm
A	if you think you know you've er
B	that's right that's right that's right
A	those
B	mm
A	are the people who
B	mm
A	who'll who are not thinking that other people can sort me out and that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you know that's the
A	yeah
B	see
B	erm
A	it's cos they're good
B	mm
A	my my friend erm
B	was was was he in the samba band?
A	he was he was an older fellow
B	right yes
A	erm
B	that wasn't
A	you're thinking with the rainbow hat?
A	that's actually
B	oh right
A	in my course
A	no he's not actually he's happily he's happily married
B	no he no there was there was one whose shoelace was undone and I kept wanting him to stop and I'd tie his shoelace for him but
A	oh
B	erm but if I saw
A	yeah he's
B	mm mm
A	recognise him
B	mm
A	and lovely lads by the sound of it
B	right right
A	and he wasn't actually
B	mm
A	still on friendly terms
B	yeah
A	erm and invited her along with him and she was asking him for money
B	mm
A	hard to
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	even though the
B	mm
A	the kids and he sorted out
B	mm
A	really well with money and with
B	mm mm mm
A	you know the house and that kind of thing but
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	to
B	yeah
A	give you something or you've got that entitle thing that
B	that's right
A	for many years
B	and because
A	yeah
B	you know but erm
A	mm
B	but there was about forty-nine percent of women worked and fifty-one percent didn't
A	not like that here in Ireland even now
B	and and it gradually grew to where
A	yeah
B	it is now
A	yeah
B	you know where
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	you know er
A	but they'd still they're
B	mm mm mm
A	whereas it depends on your
B	mm
A	the circumstance but there er
B	yeah
A	or might get you would be mucking in as well so I think erm
B	mm
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah because I mean I
B	mm
A	I mean I love not having to work
B	yeah
A	much
B	mm
A	easier for me to do it and I
B	mm
A	even though I'm not
B	mm
A	mindset in early on that she
B	oh
A	yeah she was spending money erm
B	mm
A	most
B	that's right that's right but erm
A	erm
B	mm
A	to that kind of
A	see that she has to do certain things you know
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	this
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean that erm?
A	oh yeah
B	that means that they can't go out
A	oh yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but actually working his way towards something and of course as the children grow older
A	yeah
B	they'll begin to say I want to do X Y and Z
A	yeah that's true
B	erm you know?
A	yeah that is true
B	mm
B	it will be interesting
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
A	mm
B	for whatever the other one
A	yeah
B	whatever and whatever whatever it is
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	as he's grown and he's grown stronger within himself
A	yeah
B	erm and he
A	yeah
B	blah blah blah
A	yeah
B	mm you know she'd got used to
A	mm
A	yeah
B	and but they don't
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	erm
