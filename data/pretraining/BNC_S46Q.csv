A	yeah

B	no?
E	I
E	bit like a biscuit
F	whole biscuit in
B	biscuit?
F	biscuit not finished
D	mm
F	that's enough for me
E	that was the best medal
F	yeah
A	you know if he won bronze you think he'd put it on there?
B	mm yeah
A	that's
F	some people have a penchant for bronze
A	or they think they don't deserve
F	they're not good enough yeah some people have just got
D	I saw something yeah
A	it's supposed to be really good
E	hm?
D	in what in what kind of way like? I don't can't really remember Eddie the Eagle did he always lose?
D	right
B	well he tried
E	well I don't think he'd ever been on a proper ski like proper proper snow
B	no
A	and there was no one else really doing it
B	there's no British
C	it wasn't so much that he was just a loser
C	and there was he didn't have access to a huge slope or anything and he used to practice
B	yeah some
C	and he didn't care whether he came
F	yeah it's kind of like Cool Runnings
D	right
E	there was that African guy
D	oh the African swimmer?
E	no there was an African guy in about two thousand and eight who was the
B	yeah?
D	yeah black swimmer
B	mm
D	in his country he was like the champion
B	yeah
D	but cos like nobody swam
D	no got the wrong bone density for it
A	you said they've got the wrong bone density for it?
D	but they've got like
D	their bone density is different
F	so they've got higher bone density
A	so they
F	but they
D	so they sink
F	yeah but they've got a lot
A	do they make great scuba divers?
F	more fast twitch muscle fibres
A	uhu
F	slow twitch are you know they
E	ever seen a black
B	no
E	there are none
F	seen a few black
E	but that's
E	few
B	ah
C	there is a reason for the like all the Kenyan and African runners
D	oh yeah
C	is because apparently they
C	in order to get enough food to live
B	and is it high altitude as well? so their lung capacity is erm
D	and they just start very very young don't they?
B	yeah
E	I suppose like it's an escape from poverty isn't it?
D	yeah
C	but more than that if you live in Kenya is that
D	I think a lot of them do do it as like a full-time job so whenever it's the Valencia erm
A	good
D	and they and they and I think they just go week to week to different half-marathons and marathons round Europe and take the prize monies
B	in this half-marathon this half-marathon now in Cardiff we have lots of er top athletes coming
A	Mo Farah
B	Mo Farah
D	is he?
B	yeah
C	yeah they took
D	wow
A	hundred what?
B	hundred thousand
C	hundred thousand
B	mm
D	but if you think like it's thirteen and a half miles of streets to line it's quite the space for everybody
B	yeah
A	no cos it's
B	yeah
C	I did the Cardiff marathon four or five times
B	then you're waiting for your second wind
D	yeah? is the route a good one? is it interesting?
C	well it is now but when they first started it
D	ah
C	which was nice but
D	you never want to repeat yourself
B	you don't wanna do it again
C	you there was one stretch in particular where you you
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	you have to go round again and you knew how far it was
D	yeah
C	cos you'd just done it
D	when I did the half-marathon when I got to the halfway point
B	oh
D	and I was like you just won it and I'm literally halfway
B	ah
D	and you've just sprinted all the way round
A	more
D	erm when I cos I did the ten K at the same time so everyone starts together
D	no
D	but
B	yeah
D	cos then people come for a weekend they usually bring their partners
B	yeah we did that we stayed in
D	yeah
B	and me to a
B	a vantage point around the corner you know
C	but we did erm when we first started doing it we used to do like a half-marathon every week or so every couple of weeks
D	yeah
C	it was a hell of a thing
D	yeah
A	just checking out
C	without realising how much
B	oh
D	did you do the London marathon right?
C	yeah four times actually
D	like now
A	four
D	like it's crazy business now to get into it
B	yeah
D	but you can't get into it
D	pardon?
E	two grand'll do it
D	two and a half minimum
A	you've gotta raise a lot of
D	unless you get
B	you didn't have to then did you?
D	unless you're lucky enough to get
E	we saw the guy from Barry come second once
B	and then these people with a
D	yeah
E	how many times we saw that guy do you remember the guy who was running weird
D	oh yeah
E	and I said that's the marathon guy
D	okay
E	came second did he come second or
A	didn't he run it funny?
E	got a really funny
B	very strange
C	all the best runners have
B	strange running pattern hasn't he?
C	they all see they all keep their hands low
D	yeah
D	yeah but
B	mm
D	Mo Farah's a short distance like it's really kind of unfair they've kind of now tried to be like
D	you did five K like
F	what is is that what's his stretch
D	five and ten K
F	oh really?
B	yeah
D	that's what he won at the Olympics and kind of shot him to fame and then after it
D	forty-two
F	and now they're forcing him to go
D	not forcing him
B	forcing him no
D	but
E	good for everyone though
D	yeah
E	good for him to get to
D	but it's just a bit
A	he's going up two weights
D	well it's just completely crazy
A	not straight away though I mean that takes
D	it was no and they didn't give him very long either and then he didn't win the London Marathon everyone was like er
A	come on
D	it was like well you gave him like a year
F	so is he still doing the marathon?
D	I think he's he's still doing marathons and half-marathons
C	well
E	that was delicious that was
D	yeah
C	getting paid to do that
B	well there's fruit
D	yeah but
B	but only little bits of fruit
D	yeah
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	yes nothing to do with
D	I'd go to watch him run
C	yeah
D	it's just fast when you watch the Kenyans run at the front
D	oh my goodness me
A	yeah
D	I just don't know how that's even humanly possible
F	yeah
D	and yeah and knowing that they've kept it up for that amount of time they're not just sprinting that they are well they're sprinting it but
F	well they probably run a hundred metres
D	yeah
C	I remember I did er the Cardiff marathon
D	really? oh he was a massive marathon runner wasn't he?
A	in front or behind?
D	yeah
D	and she like wrapped herself up so no one she like signed up with a kind of neutral name like just her initials
D	cos there was all this stuff where they said that like a woman couldn't do it because her internal organs would just drop out
D	and like there was no place for us to be doing it and stuff which all seems a bit
B	anybody want some fruit?
D	yes please
