A	well I voted out and then when you you know when you've done it and er
B	did
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I thought had this feeling you know on occasions I've had these feelings and I thought oh I dunno if I've done the right thing
B	I was exactly the same there were I mean all the way along I've never got to an election and not known which way I was gonna vote but all the way along I was thinking could go in I could go out
A	mm
B	there's as many reasons to stay in as there are to come out
A	I know
B	nobody really knows what's gonna happen
A	I know
B	and and even
A	I haven't seen that yet
B	cos that was amazing they put erm
A	was this last night? I went to bed
B	oh well we only yeah we didn't stay up all night we only turned the TV on this morning and erm
A	oh so it's this morning?
B	this morning we
A	that's right
B	orange if you were in
A	yeah
B	and Scotland Northern Ireland and London were orange and the rest of the country was blue
A	wow
B	it was an amazing it was absolutely amazing how concentrated it was I couldn't understand why London
B	but it was all erm it was all because I
A	yeah
B	they are talking about moving out and so there's a lot of people
A	yeah
B	might lose jobs there
A	yeah
B	but the rest of the country apart from Scotland Northern Ireland
A	gosh was all blue
B	was all blue yeah
A	that's interesting isn't it?
B	but it's but
A	well even
B	but
A	well it's
B	but there's a lot of a lot of places where it's been divided and it's only
A	just
B	yeah
A	just a little bit more isn't it?
B	yeah I know
A	but erm it's been interesting and I was I I think it was
B	this is nice is this new?
A	no last year
B	oh that's nice
A	I Tesco's
B	oh
A	I I think it was about quarter past seven when I put it on and they must have literally literally just although I didn't know it but
B	mm
A	later on when they were talking I thought god I must have literally just put the television on seconds after it was
B	announced
A	you know broadcast the
B	oh no they knew before that
A	oh did they?
B	because I had looked on my what it was I had looked on my phone when I woke up at about I dunno quarter to seven or something
A	oh
B	so they knew that
A	they knew then
B	but there was still one there was still one lot of votes that were being counted
A	oh
B	but they couldn't make a difference so I think
A	oh that's what it was then
B	they had to wait for the actual official announcement to be made
A	yeah
B	once all the votes had been counted
A	yeah
B	but but it wasn't going to make a difference
A	oh
B	can I have a drop more milk in mine
A	course you can yeah
A	either either
B	I haven't listened to it again but we just put it on when we were having lunch and still that's all they're talking about
A	is that all they're talking about still?
B	and David Cameron you know resigning
A	oh I know
B	well he has
A	don't you think?
B	although I did like him
A	yeah he turned out to be a bit of a liar didn't he?
B	well
B	they all are though aren't they?
A	they all they're all in for their own ends aren't they?
B	I don't I don't like Nigel Farage
A	no
B	he's a bit of a
A	to be honest as soon as he came out of his wife I thought mm cos they'd already said hadn't they
B	oh I hadn't yeah I I was upstairs I didn't see that bit erm
A	oh well the the the news lady was saying oh there's there's rumours all up and down the street saying he's gonna come out and resign
B	yeah yeah
A	and I think as soon as he came out with his wife
B	have another one
A	along with the rumours I thought he's gonna go but I think to be fair it would be very difficult for him to run the country
B	oh yes it would it would and he's stopping for three months isn't
A	do you wanna sit in the back and then
B	yeah
A	and then we can at least
B	shall we take these?
A	erm we can at least
B	oh when did you get your piano?
A	oh this is or was dad's piano
B	oh
A	you sit on this one
B	did you?
A	cos you can then look out the
B	did you did you tell me about it?
A	no I think I might have said that erm
B	thank you
A	I think I might have said that dad had talked I just walked in here and I can smell something
B	can you? what? that's not a real tortoise is it?
A	yeah
B	what can you smell? what a bad smell?
A	I don't know yeah but there's nothing in here
B	I can't smell anything
A	can you not?
B	no no
A	shall I lower the
B	okay so who's playing it?
A	cos my dad taught
B	oh I think I do remember that yes
A	erm and my dad sort of said to
B	yes
A	or when I'm gone erm you can have the piano
B	he's not ill is he?
B	right
A	I might so if I do
A	you can have that one and then erm
B	oh that fly?
A	erm so last weekend my dad went to
B	yeah
A	and
A	because he has this sort of overcrowded very very overcrowded garage has he gone maybe?
B	I think he's gone have to
A	very overcrowded garage that
B	oh
A	you know as you do? and erm for whatever reason I don't know
B	oh gosh
A	and invited my dad down for the weekend
B	to help tow it
A	to help cos apparently
B	did
A	yes
B	oh
A	yeah cos
B	oh gosh
A	does
B	oh how funny
A	and apparently
B	so did did you dad just go for the day or for the weekend?
A	no he went on a Friday went for a long weekend
B	oh okay nice
A	went Friday and come back Monday
B	yeah
A	and erm filled it apparently filled it but spent most of the weekend sorting out the garage
B	yeah
A	and my dad said the stuff he'd got in there he said I need to clear my garage out and I thought I'd got a lot of junk but oh my god there's been stuff there my brother erm when they moved into the house it was a big bungalow
B	mm
A	and my brother made an upstairs so he put all the the windows in and divided the
B	did he build it himself?
A	yeah he did he did all the internal structure himself
B	wow
A	yeah erm he just got an electrician in and a and a plumber in to do some for the they've got they they turned the loft area into two bedrooms so the big landing and a bathroom and then they put what are those windows called? not the Velux ones the one
B	Dorma?
A	Dorma windows in
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah
A	erm two three at the front three at the bank and my brother did as I say all the work with the exception of
B	mm
B	right yes yeah
A	cos you
B	I think it does these day
A	yeah yeah yeah what he did was he took I think it was six months off work but it was cheaper for him to take six months off work and do it himself
B	than to pay somebody to get
A	than to employ
B	really?
A	yeah yeah
B	gosh
A	yeah cos he was earning mega bucks then
B	but anyway so
A	so
B	he's filled his garage with stuff and
A	so anyway erm and along obviously you know what it's like you get a skip and you start thinking what else can I get rid of? what else can we
B	right
A	but apparently my dad reckons the speakers are better on it he thinks he prefers the sound of that one to this one where I think this is more clear
B	right
A	I think dad's is a bit bit sounds a bit more bassy sort of echoey to me anyway he prefers that one so he's kept that one but
B	typical there's there's that's
B	the way isn't it?
A	yeah
B	soon as you threaten to get rid of something they want it
A	yeah
B	but if you if you'd got rid of it without them knowing they would never ask for it
A	no she probably wouldn't have even noticed
B	no no
A	but erm my dad said do you know
B	gosh
A	and he went I I
B	that's a lot of money to throw on a skip
A	a hell of a lot of money I don't think it would
B	mm
A	and there's a where there's a bed to fold down if cos erm one two three four it's five bedroomed house but
B	do they?
A	and they have done for a long time
B	do they sleep separately then?
A	yeah
B	oh why?
A	cos
B	gonna have one of those
A	flinging her arms and kicking her legs and screaming apparently
B	does she? is she having
A	apparently
B	is she having nightmares? does she remember it?
A	yes I think she has something
B	does she remember it in the morning?
A	I don't know whether she does but
A	that's true yeah so he can you know sleep proper erm it got to the stage where
B	mm
A	and going to his own bedroom and
B	oh okay
A	ten years I've slept in separate bedrooms
B	gosh
A	I know
B	right so they've got one spare bedroom
A	mm
B	so is that where the piano was?
A	yeah but because because it's not used as a bedroom they had the piano a couple of chairs in it and then a a bed you could fold down
B	mm
A	as and when needed when
B	mm
A	left it and forgot it was there really it's a shame really but
B	well yeah because you've got that
A	mm
B	and how did your dad get the piano up to his?
A	in the back of his car
B	did he?
A	cos the side comes off the sides come off and the top sort of sits on the frame
B	oh gosh
A	mm
B	I'm amazed I wouldn't even have
A	I know
B	thought about trying to
A	I've got to repair this foot because erm dad was doing some work in the house and there was a water leak and this foot got damaged so we just need to sort of stick this down and colour it in and then you probably
B	yeah
A	wouldn't notice it
B	I wouldn't have noticed anyway
A	so
B	oh
A	yeah it's immaculate
B	mm it well of course it is
A	yeah
B	it belongs to
B	of course it's immaculate
A	so
B	mm
A	but she's been studying for her mock exams so she hadn't been on it a lot
B	mock exams?
A	mm mocks GCSE mocks
B	at the end of the year?
A	well they're doing them now
B	don't they do them?
A	they would normally do them over last
A	over a period of two weeks
B	right
A	because year nine are having exams as well
B	yes you'd never know that in our house
A	has he not?
B	didn't really realise they were doing end of year exams something slipped out no I thought oh if he's gonna follow in the footsteps of his brother with the whole anyway we will see and I said to him don't you don't
A	bless him
B	not bless him
B	not bless him at all I didn't realise they were even having exams I thought oh terrible mother
A	so how did you find out?
B	I was he was going to erm he went to a friend's house to watch the England match on Monday and I was picking up another couple of lads and taking them with me and they were talking about it in the back of the car
A	oh my goodness me
B	he's got
A	do you think though
B	I tell you what? I worry about my parenting skills more and more
A	no don't be worried because I think here we go I think you know where when they're at the
B	yes
A	you know everything that's going on don't yeah but then
B	we do know everything
A	they're at school
B	yes
A	and then he first leaves from there and you adapt to like really know knowing anything
B	mm
A	and then I think with the younger ones
B	you
A	you really don't care
B	don't no
B	no
A	we don't care do we?
B	we don't care I'm like well if
A	well exactly
A	exactly
B	you you you
A	your life your life
B	you've heard the lectures that we've given to
A	yeah yeah
B	you know? I'm not going through no
B	so we'll we will see
A	I think we are we are moving in to being prepared for when they er move on
B	to be prepared to the emptiness
A	to university
B	I don't think
A	yeah
B	to university but anyway have you heard
A	mm
B	according to
B	well business studies in particular he said there was probably twenty people before erm
B	and
A	oh
B	he's come home the last couple of days and he's had stuff drawn over his hands he's had a big heart here and stuff all up his arms I said what is going on? he said well it's like it's like I'm a novelty cos I'm the only boy
A	oh
B	I said well he said well
B	it's like I'm a novelty
B	they're just drawing on me and fawning over me
B	that'll wear off
A	oh bless him
B	so but er
A	he's gonna make up for lost time
B	oh
A	he'll have five on the go
B	who knows? but erm
A	I
B	he's got two options hasn't he? I've heard
A	I don't know
B	right well
A	ah
B	and he's still got two options he's been offered a place at that you know they're opening the
A	no
B	you possibly didn't you don't have one that plays football I only know cos of
A	yes
B	and he goes up there I mean he's really good he gets paid for play I think it's the same one
A	gosh
A	oh right
B	get paid to play
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	so and erm and this is the new the first year so there's he's
A	oh
B	because there was talk that he might do them at the
A	right
B	tie in there and his other option is to go to
A	yeah
B	the equivalent of three A Levels but just a year later cos it's like starting again in effect
A	cos it's a two year course
B	it's a two year course same as A Levels
A	mm
B	or Btec equivalent so erm he said to
A	oh yeah
B	but either way he's sort of lost a year really
A	well I know
B	well
A	I mean if he's gonna go down the the sensible route then surely he'd be better off
B	he may as well just stayed
A	returning to
B	may as well have just stayed at school and got his three A Levels and one of those
A	yeah
B	was business studies
A	it would be over in a year
B	and be done with it I know I know
A	mm
B	it seems a bit silly doesn't it?
A	perhaps er
B	mm yeah
A	ready to move on now and bearing in mind you're one of the oldest
B	yes
A	they're probably not you're probably ready for that next stage
B	yes absolutely
A	like when you get to year six
B	yes yeah
A	and it's all a bit you know
B	yeah yeah
A	too much
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he really does
A	I know but he's lost his teacher hasn't he?
B	he has lost his teacher they have replaced a teacher but this is the other thing erm they were doing the sports' leaders qualification which only Mr
A	right
B	which won't happen until September because that person's got to go through the course so if you don't come back you won't get awarded it
A	mm
B	so
A	oh dear
B	I know but also they haven't finished I mean they're still
A	no
B	they're still doing it
A	yeah
B	so erm I dunno there's a lot a lot to think about but yeah but
A	no
A	mm
B	always you know always has done he's not really an academic but erm anyway he's
A	is he going back?
B	yes well obviously
A	mm
B	we're waiting for the results on results day
A	yeah
B	but
A	I don't to be
B	no no no they're not they're not I think you could go back with all Es but I think he worries that it would be too hard for him if he only comes out with if he comes out with really poor grades in his AS levels he's said so many people have told him
A	oh really?
B	that the second year gets harder again I think he just
A	mm
B	worries that he won't be able to
A	just gonna blow my nose
B	to do it but erm
A	oh
B	anyway we'll wait and see we'll see how that goes in erm in August
A	bless him
B	but yeah
A	do you know I've looked that that black cover more than I've looked at the furniture again this year?
B	er well we've sat out quite a bit actually
A	have you?
B	I think because ours isn't covered up er and it's just through the back door
A	yeah
B	and every time the sun comes out like
B	if we hadn't have been watching stuff on the telly today we probably would have had our lunch out there today
A	see I erm
B	yes oh yeah
A	but I agree with you I know it sounds bad but I think if we went straight out that way
B	I I was just about to say to you if you
A	we'd use it a lot more
B	if you just opened that door you'd use it like I think it's because it's ours is so accessible
A	yeah yeah
B	it's literally just there and we think we'll grab a cushion on the way through in the utility and we've had it and we've had our meals out there quite quite often when it every time it's warm enough
A	mm
B	we just put the cushions out and put the place mats out there so
A	yeah it's
B	instead of the kitchen
A	yeah
B	it's so accessible
A	yeah
B	but you yeah if you opened that door
A	I I know it's not a
B	I know it's not but I know exactly what you mean
A	but it's the psychology isn't it?
B	it is and
A	through the lounge and that
B	they're the same the the lounge or the utility
A	is the lounge at the back?
B	the lounge at the back but they they've got a door up
A	yeah
B	through the utility
A	yeah
B	and round and
A	yeah
B	and they're the same
A	I said to
B	but your
A	a low window
B	mm
A	so but just more light comes in
B	yeah
A	but what I'm saying to
B	doors
A	a door or doors
B	yeah that's a good idea
A	erm and I know it's a bit awkward because of the table but I think it still gives you that choice doesn't it?
B	oh er yes I think so I think that would be nice yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	I know we could walk in and out of here but that's as far as I'm
B	I dunno and I think because we do I think because you've
A	cover it up
B	got that table there as well it's almost like the
A	yeah
B	you well no if you were going out there if there were doors there you'd
A	I just yeah
B	would just pass it to that person and that person would
A	that's it yeah
B	and you'd go out and that would be that
A	I do think the set up doesn't help and the fact
B	mm
A	cos I said to
B	is it wood?
A	no no no it's that rattan stuff
B	oh okay
A	said I'm not covering up this year said spent most of the summer last year looking at a big black bag
B	yeah
A	but you know when you it's not easily replaceable?
B	yeah
A	you can't just go out and spend five six hundred pound
B	no
A	do you know what I mean?
B	no no so you want to look after it
A	I mean we only got that because I sold my car
B	yeah no I remember you saying
A	yeah
B	but you do want to look after it but also erm it has when it's rained it's rained so heavily
A	well this is it
B	I know I know
A	it's so heavy and then I'm thinking to myself cos the bird table there we're constantly gonna get poo so then it actually before you sit down you've gotta start wiping it over which is longer than just whipping a bag off isn't it?
B	yeah it is it is I know what you mean
A	but we're hoping to get in the garden tonight
B	we're going to
A	the grass is growing like billy-o isn't it?
B	I know
A	isn't it?
B	can't even remember he wasn't at home
A	they're so hard like that
B	I never
A	mm
B	I tried a few times and I could never start it so I that that I thought it's my mowing days over
A	well the
B	but
A	and the strength deteriorates as you get older you know
B	but do they?
A	yes I mean
A	suddenly being weaker now
B	can
A	well I said to
B	yes
A	just the lanes
B	yeah
A	and do the village erm and I think she'd done
B	mm
A	she wanted to go up that long stretch for Tesco and she said oh I didn't really like it when I did it on my own I said you ran up there on your own? I said oh you shouldn't really be running up there on your own
B	it's all the lorry drivers
A	bit out of the way
B	I ran up there once or twice in the past
A	mm
B	and it I know what
A	yeah
B	much happier round the lanes
B	even though it's emptier and
A	yeah yeah
B	but it's the lorry drivers they there's something a little bit unnerving about running up there
A	yeah
B	which I couldn't quite put my finger on
A	yeah this it's so I told her not to
B	mm
A	yeah so then she she comes in
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	at least you know you know she's fell down a ditch or broke her ankle
B	yes yeah
A	and smashed
B	does she take her phone? cos
A	she does I think yeah
B	his
A	yeah and erm
B	but when are you gonna let her though?
A	and I told you not to
B	to be fair I mean she is I would let her now I think
A	it's very quiet round there
B	I've run round there
A	do you?
B	yes
A	mm
B	I run
A	yeah you do
B	you see walkers
A	yeah
B	the
A	yeah
B	you see tractors
A	yeah the odd car
B	but really it's just
A	oh no it is relatively safe
B	it is
A	but I said no you shouldn't be going round there on your own
B	did he run?
A	on his bike
B	oh on his bike
A	yeah on his bike
B	yes she should ring
A	I said why don't you give
B	he's been running quite a bit lately
A	mm
B	erm
A	right
B	come and gone now the fifteen hundred metres he did very well he got invited to the county thing he didn't do that but he got a new personal best he was very happy but he was just doing running around the village in fact I was out walking one time and and I was walking back along the canal and I heard him shout mum and I turned around and he was running up the canal which I said oh
B	I don't know whether you should be running up here anyway he did he ran off carried on but he said to me er one night he said I'm gonna go and do the run the the run that I do which is about five kilometres
A	mm
B	just short of five kilometres really I said okay I mean it takes me
A	yeah
B	he should be back by now and I'm thinking I wonder if I wasn't really paying attention to what time he went
A	yeah
B	and he won't take his phone so you do think oh I wonder if he's fallen over oh no he's probably just met somebody and he's
A	oh my god
B	he said oh and the second lap was better actually I enjoyed the second lap more I
A	well I think
B	I can't do that
A	she'd she goes out of here and and it it's just short of five miles she does and she's doing it in something like forty minutes
B	yeah they'd run well together
A	they'd run well together
B	yeah they would
A	yeah
B	they would
A	I should say to her look why don't you just organise one night
B	mm
A	to meet up with
B	just to try it out
A	give it a go trial it if either of you you know if your pace isn't right
B	yeah
A	then but it's good encouragement as well isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	if you think right going for a run
B	oh no
A	oh no no
B	but erm
A	but erm
B	he's not a dedicated runner
A	no
B	he's he was doing because he's in training for the
A	he might do his er
B	for the erm it's a long way to go to train for a fifteen hundred metres isn't it? ten K anyway
B	but he likes to just be fit he likes to be fit
A	yeah
B	for the football season
A	I mean
B	yes yeah
A	she said because otherwise you're
B	well I and I know again what she means
A	mm
B	because you're you can do your own pace then and you're not feeling under pressure to go a bit faster than you want or a bit slower than you want
A	no no
B	so I do understand what what she means
A	she does something every day
B	does she?
A	if she's not at the athletics she's at the gym or she's going out for a run
B	are you at the gym
A	all the time
B	have you been?
A	all the time in my thoughts
B	have you been?
A	I think about it all the time every day I think about it several times but I haven't quite got there
B	you haven't been
B	have another shortbread
A	haven't I always?
A	well actually I was very good in the month of May
B	were you?
A	I gave up all sugar I never had biscuit cake
A	a a biscuit
B	how much weight did you lose?
A	I did actually how much I don't know
B	wow
A	but I did
B	wow I'm not surprised
A	I lost a few pound
B	yeah
A	so I the last couple of weeks I've been well the month of May finished didn't it? so I thought
A	oh I can have a biscuit now
B	oh
A	so I thought do you know actually I feel more tired again now than I did through the month of May I felt great in the month of May
B	really?
A	cos I wasn't loaded with sugar was I?
B	then you should try and do that again
A	I'm doing it again I'm doing it again forever but I've had no chocolate or sweets
B	no
A	at all
B	since January
A	no so I'm just gonna give it all up
B	did you find it difficult in May?
A	erm no because I'd made my mind up said I said said
B	resolve of steel
A	I know when I make my mind up why can't I just?
B	yeah
A	I no not at all
B	I I would find it difficult
A	no I was fine I didn't
B	my biggest problem is wine isn't it? it's full of sugar
A	mm
B	yes cos otherwise it just gets
A	cos it doesn't happen that often
B	just gets life just gets dull
A	yeah
B	if you can't have a biscuit now and again yes
A	yeah
B	yeah no I that's a good idea
A	so so I might be relying on seeing you
A	a lot more
B	mm
A	feeling better
B	well that that
A	than I did
B	that in itself should be incentive shouldn't it?
A	yes
B	good for you yes

A	oh yes how did it go?
B	well it was such a lovely meal
A	really?
B	unbelievable he was so happy he was in his element
A	oh
B	I mean it cost me way too much money to be honest
A	but way cheaper for lunch than it would have been an evening menu all these erm
B	oh I suppose I didn't really think about that
A	yeah only because erm I was having a conversation
B	it's the bottle of wine we had that set me back anyway
A	I was having a conversation with erm I think it was
B	no does she?
A	er she's got this spreadsheet
B	what she has to visit them all?
A	yeah it is her
B	oh really?
A	yeah her and three or four girlfriends and
B	how many has she ticked off?
A	I don't know but it's a suggestion she's put forward to
B	what at that age?
A	at that age
B	they're more interested in KFC and Nando's
A	yeah
B	at that age
A	but er but anyway she took her boyfriend to
B	oh not your sister-in-law?
A	no
B	so does your brother know?
A	to erm well yeah well who knows who's she's sneaking in that bedroom at night
B	yeah
A	erm through the window erm she took her boyfriend to a Michelin star restaurant but she said it was really interesting cos when she was looking and doing the research
B	mm
A	she said erm lunch menus although you could still be
B	yeah yeah
A	paying three hundred pound for lunch in comparison to the evening menu
B	oh okay
A	so she
B	that must be different in London
A	so she said I'm thinking if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
B	yeah well we went at lunch as you know and we had what they called it sounds dreadful really it's called Brummie tapas so you could do like a a a normal lunch or there was erm there were two different tasting ones or it said you can so this Brummie tapas which I just liked the sound of the examples that it gave you and it said you sit in our comfortable
A	yeah
B	so there were five courses so and as it turned out there was like one long table in the room that you sort of go into there was comfy chairs in it so that's the room where you sit when you first arrive and have a drink and then there was another room that people were going through to to just sit and have lunch but we didn't go through to that we stayed in this room and it was like a high er a high table with sort of high chairs and and I think it said on the website the maximum they would have would be eight but
A	wow
B	they were so attentive but not intrusive it was just amazing so we sat there and there was two little er there was a little a plate with two like little round white things they looked like mints and erm you know er and I said to her what are those? and she said all will be revealed she said but they aren't edible so please don't eat those anyway so we can out he came out with the first course which was erm gosh I can't remember now the er mad as it sounds there was this homemade loaf of bread that was just the nicest bread I've ever had there was these erm what are they called those churros with parmesan
A	oh yeah
B	there was erm oh I can't remember what they all were now it was a few weeks ago there was a couple of different things but you were using your your fingers to eat this first bit and then he said and then now I'll show you what these are and he got this jug of hot water and he poured it over what I thought were mints and they just grew and they turned out to be serviettes it was incredible to watch they just grew and these you know like the hot serviettes they give you in a Chinese restaurant?
A	oh wow
B	yeah and they were were rolled up really tightly so we had those for afterwards erm and then we had we had oh one was beef and octopus but this octopus had been done for five hours in red wine it was so nice but like I say every the presentation was unbelievable one of them was
A	oh
B	you just literally put your knife in it just fell apart with PH tomatoes they called them but there was different coloured tomatoes and one had been done in like er honey and lemon and one had been done in something else they were everything was so excuse me
A	oh wow
B	so nice and we had this absolutely fantastic dessert and then at the end there there was it was called chocky
A	oh wow
B	for the senses it was absolutely it was incredible it was so so nice
A	an experience
B	it was a but I mean actually the food wasn't it wasn't that it was fifty-five pounds a head which I didn't think was that bad
A	no
B	for all everything that we had and then they add twelve and a half per cent service it said that before you booked so you knew that so sixty something a head and then erm they gave us a big wine list and I was driving at the other end you know from the station and then I had to do the driving for that
A	you should have said
B	I'll no no but there was still the boys to do tennis and everything so we were out in the day so it was fine but I said to
B	I said to the erm the guy I said how many of those do you keep in stock?
A	no
B	so you know he talked us through that and a bit of the history and why that was anyway we settled on a much much more modest bottle for
B	I said I've never paid so much for a bottle of wine erm but I said go on it's your birthday go on I said that's like erm
B	gonna have to work four hours to do that for you
B	anyway so he asked for this wine and the guy goes I'm ever so sorry I haven't got that one he said but I have got this one and it's really really nice and it was one below but that was sixty so
B	I said to him blinking heck man I said that's that's a full day's that's a full day's proofreading for me
B	so you can sit and have that lovely bottle of red wine so I have a glass of it and it was very nice but do you know what? er sixty pounds nice I don't know but anyway
A	did you have a taste?
B	yes I had one I had one small glass
A	and would you?
B	no I wouldn't er no it was very nice but I wouldn't have
A	see it would be totally wasted on me
B	it was very nice but we get nice wines from the Sunday Times
A	you do
B	club and
A	yeah
B	and or er you know no no difference however
A	ah
B	so it was definitely worth and he was like oh he's like oh
A	thing is
B	got
A	what are you doing for his fiftieth? I mean that is
B	that's what it was a
A	a really nice experience
B	it was I wasn't expecting it to be when he when I thought about it I wasn't really expecting to put to spend two hundred pounds I don't know why
A	mm
B	which is what I spent two hundred pounds exactly which is a lot of money for lunch but he had such a nice time
A	but it's but it's a lovely
B	I had a nice time as well
A	yeah but erm he did so much more than just eating it
B	he'd happily
A	it's education and everything isn't it?
B	he'd happily do go cos there's there's three or four Michelin stared restaurants in
A	yeah
B	when he's fifty yeah well he had such a nice time but when we were sitting at the table eating there was these two ladies they were just having a drink before they went through to the dining room and they erm ordered a bottle of champagne house champagne cos who knows how much the champagne would have been? and erm the guy who's serving them said oh you know is it a special occasion ladies? no no we just wanted to come
A	definitely the life
B	to eat in and there was another there was three older people that were sitting having a drink before they went through and they were clearly regulars they knew the staff this was their favourite place to eat and
A	oh god
B	you know and I just thought oh how lovely to to have that disposable income that you could just do that just because and wash it down with a bottle of champagne
A	and there's me erm on the twenty-third of July
B	oh has has there been a notice up?
A	for the fundraising yeah
B	I I have seen the notice yeah
A	yeah and it's five pound a ticket and there's me debating when
B	if you're gonna go
A	money for that four times four
B	yeah well we just
A	oh
B	erm Shakespeare in the Park tickets for tomorrow night have you ever done that?
A	oh no no we've done the erm Proms in the Park
B	yes
A	but not Shakespeare
B	we did that
A	can I have another one?
B	yeah of course you can
A	thank you
B	erm well
A	oh is he?
B	yes he's acting in it
A	oh
B	and erm we've never done it because I'm not a massive Shakespeare fan if I'm honest
A	mm
B	and I was saying this and
A	it's a must isn't it? you've gotta do at least one Shakespeare in your life
B	I suppose so
A	mm
B	but you're sitting on hay bales
A	mm
B	so we've been advised to take cos it's at
A	right
B	so that's the park it's not in
A	no
B	I don't know why I always assumed it was
A	mm
B	or a bin bag or something and they take pillows as well to sit on and it starts at quarter to eight but they say she says we usually get there an hour before and we take out a picnic lots of people do that
A	yeah
B	they sit and have their picnic and then you can carry on drinking your wine or whatever while the production goes on and it's all out in
A	have you got one of those picnic blankets with the plastic backing?
B	yes we have actually
A	you have
B	yeah we have
A	I was gonna say you can take
B	thank you yes and the rucksack we bought last a couple of years ago actually it's a nice picnic rucksack you know
A	mm
B	it's got little wine glasses in
A	mm
B	corkscrew plates everything and yeah so we will take that er but
A	wow
B	she said after the there's a matinee on the Saturday so after everybody's gone from the matinee before
A	mm
B	to save them some
A	their spot
B	er so she said she's save us a couple as well so that's nice so we're doing that tomorrow night
A	oh nice
B	cos I I I left it I've only just booked it before I came up here because I was waiting to see what the weather was like
A	mm
B	cos
A	wouldn't be pleasant if it's raining
B	no no cos she said you're not allowed to put umbrellas up because obviously
A	no
B	then people can't see but it's forecast dry whether it will be is anybody's guess but erm
A	oh
B	anyway so yes that'll be something different should apparently there's fireworks at the end she there's all all they've put all little fairy lights all around the tree she said it is lovely it's well worth doing
A	oh it'll be lovely
B	fireworks at the end of it so
A	mm ah
B	because she did invite us last year did we want to go last year? again I was a bit oh I don't really like Shakespeare but last year it clashed with the solstice walk
A	oh yeah you did that
B	and we were doing that
A	mm
B	yeah
A	really what you should do is erm
B	yeah
A	and enjoy the evening
B	we could mind you
A	oh I see
B	anyway
A	mm
B	and that's fine with me cos you know me I'll take a
A	will you?
B	I'll take a bottle of wine and
A	you can have a drink
B	thoroughly enjoy it
A	it's so much cheaper than yours
B	yes
B	so you know
A	oh that'll be really really nice that will
B	hope so
A	yeah
B	hope so I said to

B	yes yeah
A	getting sort of but yeah we've been for about three or four
B	gosh
A	well god no longer than that
B	are you going this year?
A	I don't know we usually decide
B	do it at the last minute
A	on the weather
B	cos it's er
A	yeah we don't make any firm
B	it's a free yeah well I did say to
A	mm I know
B	we don't even go to the
A	no I don't any more
B	do you know what
A	I think you kind of grow out of it
B	yes
A	don't you?
B	yeah
B	definitely but there's
B	plenty of other stuff that I think no we should it's all there on our doorstep
A	I know and we don't
B	we should so that's why said well let's let's go
A	I have got a little magazine here I think that came through must have been at the beginning of the year and it's erm
B	oh the what what's on thing with all the erm
A	yeah the
B	gazette?
B	I know there's loads and loads
A	you think there's so much isn't there?
B	there is
A	to to do and see and enjoy who was it who said to me oh you know erm you know as you walk in back down to your house?
B	yeah
A	where I don't know if you know
B	the
A	yes
B	yes
A	well next door to them coming you know where the buildings on the front that they had all renovated
B	yes
A	right well
B	oh okay
A	and I was walking
B	hospital are you alright? yeah
A	what's wrong?
B	yeah
A	no so you think oh as and when I bump into you like she well do you know
B	I can't even picture them
A	no
B	I'm not sure who they are
A	er they're very private people
B	I know the building you mean so I possibly
A	yeah
B	must have seen them
B	mm
A	he's the way he sort of held his arm
B	oh
A	quite small slight man and
B	yes yeah
A	I mean I wouldn't know them if it wasn't for Avon
B	oh okay
A	you know they don't
B	okay
A	don't get involved in children are grown up now
B	mm
A	thirty-two and thirty-four but erm but anyway she had breast cancer
B	oh
A	all that was sorted and done
B	mm
A	symptoms and that unfortunately she had erm septicaemia
B	oh dear
A	she was whisked into hospital very very poorly
B	how
A	yeah
B	seventies?
A	I wouldn't I do you know I don't even think they're seventy yet
A	yeah
B	about sixties
A	I would say mid to late
B	gosh
A	mid mid to late sixties? dunno he hasn't been at work for quite some time I think but I think that may be perhaps due to his condition I don't know so I don't know whether he's sort of officially
B	mm
A	I would say they're probably gonna be sixty-five plus but I don't think they're quite seventy yet so erm he has a mental breakdown and ended up in hospital a mental hospital for two months again
B	gosh
A	it accelerated his condition he he went on to have a couple of small strokes and basically now through the septicaemia she's got heart damage so her left ventricle isn't working properly she gets very tired de-de-de-de-de-de this condition she's got erm you can either get better from it but it can take eighteen months two years stay as it is and it's permanent damage
B	that's how you are
A	and all the rest of it
B	yeah
A	or it can get worse so she's obviously hoping she's in that I'm gonna get better stage but eighteen months on she's only just starting to feel better
B	is she? and that's quite a big house to live in on your own isn't it?
A	well
B	mm
A	sort of family home I don't they've
B	that's at the back of your mind though
A	big when you're on your own
B	that eventually you're going to have to leave
A	eventually
B	so you may as well do it while you're
A	I don't know
B	well
A	whether she's having to pay for
B	right
A	care so is it financial?
B	yes yeah
A	or or
B	it could be that
A	like you say it's a big home to look after all by yourself isn't it?
B	where's which home is he in do you know?
A	er yeah
B	is it close?
A	the one at the back of
B	didn't know there was one
A	when nan was in the home in
B	right
A	that used to own the one in
B	waiting
A	and waiting for her
B	yes
A	to turn up
B	yeah
A	and her feeling the pressure of I've got to be there
B	and he's in there that's it now for good?
A	that's it he'll never come back home yeah he's you know he she can't look after him I think maybe the condition of his strokes you know
B	and Parkinson's
A	and Parkinson's but she said when she goes to visit him if he's okay she said they'll go for a little walk into
B	has got loads
A	to offer
B	I know
A	that we're so fast paced these days getting on with our lives that we don't actually
B	forget really that what's
A	realise
B	I know
A	what's on our doorstep
B	that's I don't know what's made me sort of think about that recently but I have I keep thinking we don't take advantage we don't
A	no
B	but that's great for her though if she can walk places from
A	well yeah yeah she said we go to
B	mm
A	and we have an ice cream there's endless choices of coffee a meal if we want you know some nice shops to look around
B	yeah yeah
A	she said but so much more than just shops
B	yeah definitely
A	mm
B	I always I mean er you know when I'm in a park on a Wednesday when we go for our run it's I always think oh so beautiful cos the cathedral you know
A	oh I know
B	through the park and on a nice evening
A	I know it's
B	it's just beautiful
A	yeah mm
B	we are very lucky to have it all on the doorstep
A	when I go whenever I go to that cathedral you know I every time I look with the same amount of enthusiasm and wonder of how did they do this?
B	I know I know
A	when you think of the the lack of
B	yeah
A	you know machines and all the rest of it
B	I know
A	and the
B	it's amazing
A	the height of it and the structure and the carving and it's just amazing isn't it?
B	I know I know
A	absolutely amazing and I mean you can understand why true craft men like stonemasons and you know all these people you can understand the frustration they have in modern day building can't you?
B	oh yes yeah
A	and you'd look at something as spectacular at that
B	it's unbelievable mm mm
A	you know it's erm
B	yeah
A	and and and I suppose if the need is not there you're always gonna have maintenance aren't you? but if the need is not there in the demand of like building and that that it's it dies
B	yes yeah it does yeah yeah
A	it dies
B	shall we have another coffee?

B	yes
A	that
B	but it
A	is so lovely
B	it looks empty it doesn't look like there's anybody else there does it?
A	is it a shared pool?
B	it is a shared pool for all the apartments so sometimes you know it's all the sun loungers are full
A	oh right
B	but it doesn't but I mean of course we're not in the erm we've not in the school holidays yet
A	and I just thought
B	I know
A	you've got the same cup but I'm looking at that thinking you're gonna want some more milk
B	oh am I? am I gonna be awkward?
A	you have got the same cup do you want more milk than that?
B	let's have a look no that'll be fine
A	are you sure?
B	thanks
A	mm
B	erm because of having
A	oh
A	oh
A	yeah
B	there's probably going to be more grandchildren coming out there
A	oh that's
B	so there was a
A	oh
B	and they took his door bouncer so there's another one of him bouncing in the apartment just happy you know just in his little nappy happy
A	bless him ah
A	he looks so cute
B	ah
A	oh baby
B	yeah so they went on Tuesday I think they've just got another week
A	when's his birthday?
B	oh do you know
A	do let me know so I must
B	you haven't still haven't met him in the flesh have you?
A	I know
B	we need to sort that out
A	I know
B	you should do it
A	it's all family and friends and
B	I know but he's seven months old now well
A	oh I'll have to pop in one day
B	well
A	oh is she going back?
B	well she's going back
A	oh yes I remember
B	for her three weeks to get the maternity pay
A	cos then she gets the holiday money don't she?
B	and then she's going back I think it's three days a week in September
A	mm
B	but yeah so
A	oh
B	so you'll have to erm you'll have to
A	oh
B	you'll have to go round and see
A	pop over
B	yes
A	absolutely yeah
B	he's such a little cutey
A	ah
B	I know so did
A	yes
B	at school? did you phone?
A	I did I phoned and I said erm oh I wonder if you could put me through to the person that deals with the car passes please put me through and I said oh I said I I wonder if you could help me please I said erm my name's
B	mm
A	I said erm
B	mm
A	I said now I'm just phoning he's been to ask about
B	mm
A	erm he said shall he come back in a week or so when the year thirteens have handed them back in and he was told no come back in September I said but nobody's taken his name or anything cos they'd erm what I don't want to happen is he comes in September and then they say
B	and they've all gone
A	oh they've all gone I said so I said the situation is this so I went on to say about car and job
B	mm
A	I said now we live in
B	yeah yeah
A	I said we live in
B	at four o'clock or whatever
A	he's gonna have to refuse
B	yes yeah
A	either refuse a shift or say yes he can be there and then phone up and let them down which I don't think is fair
B	mm
A	I said don't get me wrong I'm not saying he needs to be prioritised everybody's needs are equal but if you could perhaps take this into account
B	mm
A	and at least get him on a list oh yes she said absolutely he's not on a list she said you're absolutely right she said no this is interesting she said because like you say he can't just walk to school if he's got the option
B	mm
A	of some extra work
B	yeah absolutely
A	by him having his car here he can either go straight there
B	mm
A	or you know
B	yeah
A	and I said well yeah she said no she said this is erm she said I need to know she said I've not had one like this before she said so I need to know what to do so I said okay she
B	so had she said prior to that that there were no passes?
A	that that there were no passes yeah
B	but I still don't believe that
A	well I don't know whether it was the same lady that I spoke to
B	I still don't believe that because all the sixth formers
A	I know
B	that have done their A Levels have are not
A	have gone
B	and there were loads of them had passes
A	I know so I
B	right
A	so erm she said leave it with me erm she said I'll speak to head of I'll speak to head of sixth form I said well he's already done that and he was sent to like reception main reception she said erm she said
A	don't worry I'll speak to you tomorrow and I said it's not a rush just as long as I know his name's down and potentially September he can
B	yes
A	get one
B	yeah
A	so she got back to me the same day she said it's all sorted Mrs
B	she's the business studies teacher
A	oh is she?
A	well she got it all organised and it was something to do with
B	well I don't know
A	something
B	right
A	anyway he'd got a pass through that department
B	oh okay good
A	erm and it's all sorted she said and er hopefully she said
B	I can't remember when they started going in
A	erm it was the same week anyway they phoned up
B	right
A	and said he'd got a pass and I said oh thank you ever so much I said I'm ever so grateful and lo and behold he's twice he's been to work
B	oh straight from school?
A	twice no he's come home first but he had to be there for five o'clock
B	oh wow oh great
A	and he's not at home
B	no but that's good
A	that much before the bus to be honest I think by the time they get out
B	oh yeah I know yeah
A	because of the fight with the bus and everything
A	erm but it still makes a difference you know it's an extra an extra ten minutes
A	in bed
B	I know
B	I said you are giving him your bus money aren't you? he said yes I am
A	well first of all
B	mm
A	cos
B	she's right yeah
A	start off as you mean to go on she's obviously been there and
B	yes yeah yeah
A	not driving but maybe seeing other people being taken advantage of so apparently he got this app that she was telling him about and he's worked it out and it's sixty pence to school
B	what is?
A	to get from
B	that costs him?
A	yeah sixty pence
B	in petrol?
A	apparently to get to school
B	oh
A	so he's only having a pound off them both ways fifty P a way
A	fifty P a way
B	I will have a word cos I'm still giving him two pound forty a day
B	did he really? right thank you for that tip
A	yeah yes
A	well well
B	blinking boy
A	a pound each way yeah and and I thought blimey well if if
B	yes
A	but do you know what I mean?
B	yeah but you know
A	so when he
B	ah bless him god I didn't even know
A	you can get an app now yeah and I said well you've gotta think of your wear and tear
B	yes absolutely
A	I said so you have to
B	it's not just petrol is it?
A	it's not just the petrol it's wear and tear no he said he he said erm
B	I suppose he
A	so
B	if he was going anyway the wear and tear
A	anyway
B	but you know yeah
A	exactly
B	that's very generous of him
A	yeah
B	but thank you for that tip I will have a word with that
A	so one pound
A	that's both ways
B	so it's only costing him five pounds apart from when he doesn't come with
A	oh is that why he stayed?
B	the other day
B	he had detention
B	I tell you what
B	er it was last Thursday right?
A	mm
B	he was
A	can I have another one?
B	course you can?
A	how many have I had then? four?
B	it doesn't matter
A	thank you
B	and
A	mm
B	and then they'd had this talk about study leave is er as home study is a privilege not a right it'll be taken away etcetera etcetera
A	I think that was when
B	oh okay
A	yeah
A	mm
B	before the England match being on in and half the school not turning up anyway so they
A	yeah in the classroom or something
B	hooked up to a screen
A	yeah
B	in the classroom
A	yeah
B	and erm er they weren't supposed to be doing this and there was a PE teacher next door
A	mm
B	who got wind that they were sending somebody down to check that they weren't doing this so apparently this PE teacher think it's the new one came in and said look guys there's somebody on their way minimise this screen and I'll tell them I haven't heard a thing
A	mm
B	and then they're just gonna come and check and then you can put it back on
B	I thought typical PE teacher
B	so that's what they did so they
B	only comes round once a fortnight
A	yeah
B	and he missed it once before and he talked his way out of a detention he got given but erm
B	so he'd
A	mm
B	so ten minutes before the end he went next door to to the lesson to the guy and he just said
A	oh no
B	so that was that
B	next day I got a
B	yesterday Thursday
B	for missing guided study but before I didn't know any of this I was at home I wasn't watching the England match doing a bit of housework minding my own business a Whatsapp comes through from
B	what?
B	got myself in a bit of bother
B	can you help me out?
B	so I just I just ignored him at that point and then when he came home and told me the entire story I said so part way through guided study you went in and asked would sir mark you there anyway and now you want me to say you were at the dentist?
A	the dentist
B	oh so I haven't thought that through have I? I said no
B	what is he like?
A	oh god
B	so it was supposed to be Thursday Thursday after school
A	oh my gosh bit of
B	and erm the at the at the tennis club they're doing the internal
A	oh yeah?
B	and they're all in it and
A	yeah
B	I said I'm just gonna pretend I was in a meeting or something I don't know what to say but they haven't phoned me he got away with it he was right
A	well they've done it before
B	well
A	they've done it before
A	cos I said to
B	fire
A	you're on the premises
B	premises yes I know
A	I said so you've gotta you've gotta
B	but I think it's quite a
A	deal with that
B	it's quite a poor system
A	if that's your
B	really
A	it is
B	that they can just walk out and nobody had noticed
A	mm
B	which nobody did nobody did phone me
A	cos they did it before didn't they? they come home
B	yeah they have done I know
B	once
A	on a Thursday but did you hear about that England match that erm they had pizzas passed through the classroom window or something?
B	no
A	yeah
A	through the classroom window cos
B	yeah yeah
A	and watched it he said no no no we watched er we couldn't we watched it at school
B	school which they weren't meant to
A	they'd had
B	pizzas
B	so they
B	had pizzas they may as well've let them come home
A	they might as well have
B	I know
A	er you know
B	if they yeah if they've if they've got
A	I know it's difficult
B	are finished it's the summer
A	yeah
A	mm
B	so he's not going to
A	it's a shame
A	but then I suppose that's real life innit if you're at work
B	well yeah that well
A	and you wanna watch it you have to book time off
B	but then
A	oh really?
B	yeah even
A	oh

B	wow that is impressive was something
A	I know
B	last time I talked to you were telling me how
A	I know but I
B	oh isn't that funny?
A	I think it was because he was so smart and well turned out he always used to come with his mate
B	which you probably wouldn't normally get in a working er well
A	not very often no
B	did you say working man's club?
A	ex-servicemen's club
B	service yeah
A	mind you there were some
B	well yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but yeah I remember what he drank
B	gosh
A	and then I
A	I said I'd better sit down I need to sort this out so I sits down and I said where do you live? and she said and I went no I said but I know I I know you really well because I know your voice anyway it was form she was my buyer at the
B	oh
A	when I was selling stationery and print erm and I used to go and see her every month cos it was massive massive the turnover was massive so warranted a monthly visit I'd be there for a morning putting stock control and all the rest of it and she was my main buyer
B	gosh did she remember you?
A	yeah yeah as soon as I sort of went
A	I said where did you work? I said I'm thinking work where have you worked? she went Birmingham and I went oh my god
A	she went
A	I'm
A	yeah
B	oh gosh
A	really bizarre really bizarre there was another lady there as well that I erm I sat down and I went oh I know you from somewhere and I used to work with her at
B	oh my goodness we're going back a bit
A	and she was one of the one of the erm one of the internal sales staff
B	mm
A	erm and I was out in the field like and she had an affair do you remember that chap I went to work for
B	yes
A	eighteen months two years
B	yes
A	come and work for me and I I used to go
B	yes
A	I've changed I've changed she had an affair with him
B	oh he hadn't changed then
A	no no
B	oh gosh
A	well I don't know whether he still
B	what a small world
A	but it yeah
B	mm I was talking to erm
A	mm
B	er
B	yes
A	mm
B	to the cottage
A	yeah
B	he said he said I
A	mm
B	and if I sold that land I'd probably be
A	a lot better off
B	a lot better off back back to where I was sort of thing
A	would he stay there for would he?
B	yes er he's yes he's planning to stay
A	so maybe one house to the left and two to the right then
B	I don't I don't know
A	cos that pond is it's not his private pond
B	is it not?
A	it no no as far as I'm aware
B	no not er I don't I don't know I didn't go into all the details
A	I don't think he could er I don't think that could be filled in but
B	cos
A	if that brook runs along all the way along that
A	does he?
B	he says they're a lot of maintenance and work
A	mm
B	and he said and you know and it's been great having it but he doesn't need it now nobody uses it so erm but yeah I thought gosh
A	and is he with anybody else?
B	not I didn't ask
A	mm
B	but not that I'm aware of and I you know I'm not seeing any he didn't offer that information but he seemed quite happy
A	cos
B	I haven't seen her for a long time but she was last time I saw her
A	yeah
B	which was oh was it October half term
A	I think so
B	longer than six months ago eight months
A	mm
B	but yeah I don't know whether she still comes into the village on a Wednesday to do toddlers
A	yeah I saw I saw her car in the car park
B	oh have you?
A	yeah
B	oh she must still do that then
A	but I was talking to
B	mm
A	at the hospice well just volunteer work
B	oh does she?
A	yeah and I said to her I said erm I said I was absolutely shocked when I'd heard what had happened she said yeah but you don't know the full story and I said well you know when you hear something and you think there's got to have been massive
B	not yes yeah yeah
A	justification for that because the person you think you know
B	mm
A	or the person you've talked to and you build a picture up that you think you couldn't ever
B	imagine
A	she went you're absolutely right she said erm there's a lot to it
B	oh really?
A	or anything and I said and you're doing as your told are you?
B	she's I always get confused
A	she
B	the dad is
A	yeah yeah so
B	who she's married to
A	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah erm she said we're not allowed
B	yes cos they always seemed to get on very well
A	she said I love
B	oh
A	erm you're absolutely right with your thoughts she said cos you know she's not that sort of lady
B	gosh
A	mm
B	she must have been pushed to the limit I suppose then
A	she must she must have been
B	she must have been to to leave all
A	because you would never that impression would you?
B	no
A	of that never
B	no you wouldn't no no
A	she was all
B	er
A	really nice
B	mm
A	that you would think she'd have that same sort of that same sort of
B	outlook sort of
A	yeah on her whole life you know
B	yes yeah
A	towards her family life and and everything wouldn't you? and
B	mm mm
A	yet
B	the do you have to go and turn it off when it's?
A	yeah
B	does it beep until you turn it off?
A	it will turn off by it will stop
B	oh will it?
A	if if I ignore it but it does bleep quite a few times it's just
B	oh
A	put all her bedding in the washing her teddy bear and her pig
A	cos she sleeps with them
B	oh
A	shame isn't it?
B	it is a shame
A	but you know the man she's with?
B	yes
A	I
B	I don't know what are you gonna say?
A	that he had done the same to his
B	oh that wasn't me
A	right I think it might be
B	yeah
A	does some sort of volunteer work at our school I dunno who she is
B	oh really?
A	but apparently she does some work at our school
B	oh
A	I know
B	he lived in a bedsit
A	well
B	maybe he'd moved out into that
A	maybe he'd moved out but the the wife he was with or the partner or whatever
B	mm
A	he'd done the same to his previous so like you got say let's say
B	oh
A	and I dunno how long this goes but let's say wife number one original wife
B	mm
A	only ever he cheated on her
B	mm
A	for the lady
B	that he's now left for
A	that he's left for
B	mad right well that doesn't bode well does it? you wouldn't choose somebody like that cos
A	no
B	they'll do it again
A	well
B	mm
B	yes yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	anyway I I mean I haven't seen her for ages but he did say yes she went in January
A	mm so do the children still live with him?
B	I believe so sometimes when I walk past or run past the cars are there
A	oh they have a
B	as far as I'm aware they do
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I suppose they're flitting to suit themselves
B	well yes
A	between the two now
B	cos what are they? twenty? twenty-two that sort of age
A	but
B	erm
A	I don't think they
B	er er the girl I forget their names the girl wasn't
A	was it
A	mm
B	but I don't know I don't know again I only really got one side of the story
A	yeah
B	so you just don't know do you?
A	you don't know do you?
B	you
A	mm
B	and even if you had both nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors do they?
A	no no no no
B	so but yeah it is a shame
A	but erm changing the subject
B	oh is that why she's gone back to
A	yeah
B	I did see a think on Facebook that she was travelling to
A	and then on yeah and then on
B	oh no
A	and this is why she's dashed out she wants to go and be with her mum
B	oh no
A	yeah so Parkinson's and
B	how long is she going for? is
A	ten days
B	oh gosh
A	so
B	oh that's not good is it?
A	no no it isn't
B	there's so much we're at that age aren't we where our parents?
A	oh
B	I mean he he hadn't been well anyway he had other things and he's in his eighties but er he currently in
A	oh
B	sent home from work and I it's just we're just sort of at that age where
A	mm
B	oh that's a shame for
A	I know
B	and that's where it's you that's where you really appreciate how far away you are when you live in a different
A	yeah
B	country
A	yeah cos it's not gonna be easy for her to support
B	no
A	her mum
B	no
A	erm
B	it's not it is her mum on her own?
A	no
B	did she remarry?
A	step yes remarried
B	stepdad so
A	stepdad
B	so he's there to look after her but
A	and her siblings are there aren't they?
B	mm mm
A	I think
B	right
A	she's gonna you know when they a couple of years was it when the girls were in year six or just after? they contemplated moving back to Sweden didn't they?
B	did they?
A	yeah she's gonna be wishing she had now isn't she?
B	mm
A	but it's a massive upheaval I know that's a this is about to sound awful what I'm about to say it's a massive upheaval for potentially a short time of your life isn't it?
B	yes yes if yes if she's
A	mm
B	unwell like that yes of course it is
A	I mean the only thing she can do is just flip back and
B	forwards yeah
A	as often as she can
A	you know and the girls are older now oh
B	well why? what
A	well apparently she woke up in the night
B	when she was at home or still at uni?
A	yeah no at home
B	yes
A	she I've got the exact words but I mean she woke up apparently in pain and she was really crying and
B	mm
A	something going on and her throat was closing up I think it was like an infection or something
B	oh my goodness
A	and her throat was actually you know the swelling
B	what so she couldn't breathe?
B	gosh
A	yeah it she said
B	oh okay right yes
A	erm so yeah and she was on some sort of you know well
B	do they know what caused it? is it
A	I don't know I haven't spoke to her
B	gosh
A	it was just what someone said in
B	that's a worry as well isn't it?
A	yeah
A	so she's got all that going on and
B	and then her mum
A	and now her poor mum
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah she's got her job back at Halfords
B	oh was she working there before?
A	yeah yeah
B	oh I didn't realise that
A	so she's gonna be there
B	and all on
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	yeah so she's she's there yeah
B	gosh
A	I was talking to somebody yesterday was it? and erm

A	and his eighty
B	but
A	no yeah eighty something years of age mother looking after him and cos she said she said you know if they they've been waiting for a bed you know if they go do you have like your own ambulances? and I said no just run-of-the-mill I said we do have ambulances but they're seated they're not you know like bed ambulances
B	mm
A	oh she said I think he might have been taken last night then to
B	oh what a shame so they the children how many children?
A	two I think
B	have won't have a mum or a dad and they oh
A	terrible isn't it? terrible
B	oh my goodness that is awful
A	and I was standing there yesterday I was opposite the X-ray department do you know I think every
B	insight into who's coming and going sort of
A	just just no a real sort of like insight as to how erm delicate life is do you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	and I saw man
B	how yeah yeah of that he saw
A	he didn't look at me or nothing I could just tell
B	yeah
A	he'd seen the words and all the rest of it and you think oh my god
B	it's awful
A	there are so many people
B	I know
A	so many people and
B	how delicate I know
A	and people that I think cos I'm a woman a lot of people come to speak to me
B	yes
A	and like particularly at the hospitals and they're coming to visit you know and they'll say you know like oh mm erm this lady came a couple of weeks ago and again her opening words were absolutely marvellous you people you know blah blah blah we were the second week of May and her husband had died on the first of May and she went on to tell me erm that she's gonna do erm a fundraising event at home in the garden and they're gonna get some paintballs and throw them at a big white sheet
B	mm
A	and draw and write a message and cut it and auction it off
B	ah
A	to raise funds for
B	for
A	yeah they'd looked after him yeah
B	yeah
A	and I said erm I said oh I can you know some balloons or buckets we can get you
B	yeah yeah
A	we can help you you know we can she said oh that would be brilliant I could put some balloons up outside the house so everybody knows where it is and all this and that
B	mm mm
A	so I I said I'll do that for you give you the address details and take it all and everything and she said to me you can probably the way I'm talking it hasn't hit me yet
B	mm
A	you know and you think and I'm looking at this woman and and I'm thinking you're you're you're not even old as old as me
B	yeah
A	at a guess
B	yeah

A	good health
B	no

A	yeah
B	big padded thing over it really so how I don't know what she would have hit it on she says you know sometimes it it you know sometimes she lashes out if they're trying to wash her or move her erm she said I I will get to the bottom of what's happened she said but you know it it's okay and everything and it's just that she's got very thin skin cos she's so blinking old

A	and then we're on the stage doing
B	yeah a long time ago that that was out
A	but but you know our kids have gone through and
B	gone through it all and are in the sixth form now I know
A	and almost now you know not far off finishing
B	I know
A	I know
B	you all went together
A	did we?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	she said it was
A	little outing yeah
A	for their school
B	for reception
A	oh let's have a day out
B	I know
A	I know
B	did I tell you she's getting married?
A	yeah
B	oh I did?
A	are you invited?
B	no I haven't spoken to her
B	no she's not it was
A	but I thought
B	I I don't know about that
A	oh
B	a handful of family literally a handful of family
A	oh
B	really low key I said oh okay
A	they must do they see each other fairly regular?
B	I don't know how regularly but it had come up because that particular day
A	maybe
B	I don't know how regularly they see each other
A	mm
B	I don't you know I don't
A	no
B	it was possibly on
A	mm
B	already?
B	is he skiving then? it's not the end of the school day yet
A	just check
B	who are you expecting
B	oh
A	what?
B	might be next door
A	might be next door
B	gonna say it's not the end of the day yet
A	oh really? where?
B	so don't let me go oh only to the tennis club obviously
A	oh
B	where else do I go?
B	oh
A	erm
A	does he?
A	oh
B	I was down there last night and for the first time
A	is he doing tennis?
B	yeah he's been doing tennis for a while now
A	oh I didn't know bless him
B	oh yes he has he's been going down there and this is the first time
A	ah
B	he's entered the club tournament and he he had this match last night but he lost he did alright but he's just he doesn't have a backhand if he can he'll run around and hit a forehand
A	oh
B	but every time he has to hit a backhand it was a it's a disaster
A	mm
B	before and
A	mm
B	he needs to practise
A	how much are lessons?
B	with
A	oh of course yeah
B	I said she helped you out an awful lot
A	true
B	so I'm not gonna charge them
A	yeah that's true
B	which I thought was very
A	of course that's very nice of him
B	you know very nice of him actually cos
A	yeah
B	obviously he's doing it for money but erm but now for coaching with
A	mm
B	and then he does it he gets paid I think he only gets paid seven for his
A	yeah
B	practise that shot
A	yeah
B	and he can just
A	just he
B	he takes a basket he takes a basket of balls and he stands there and he's just wherever she wants the ball to be to practise her shot he can hit it to her so I
A	yeah
B	but anyway he said oh you know she is my doubles partner now so of course
B	just say no just say no because you know middle aged ladies bored housewives a lot of them
B	if she
B	we've been ribbing something rotten so he went down and hit with her
A	oh
B	and then he came away and he said er well she's paying me for the next three sessions
B	in advance
B	so so er oh she likes you
A	oh bless him
B	you're only sixteen oh we did we often winding him up poor boy but erm
B	thought well that's nice cos quite like he's gonna do another hour tomorrow but quite often on a Saturday he has his two hours' coaching nine to eleven that he gets paid for quite often he wants to stay down there cos he plays again maybe at twelve but he's he's got an hour where he doesn't do anything
A	yeah so if she's fitting it in
B	so if she's gonna come and fit in in that hour so even though it's only a a fiver but it's a fiver he wouldn't have had and he's happy to just
A	yeah
B	he takes his basket and he just
A	well
B	well yeah it's not a lot is it?
A	but it's still not a bad rate just for
B	er no
A	I know he charges ten but
B	it's not no I know it's not but I mean he
A	oh he's done is courses yeah
B	he's done his course so we do we do need to get him a
A	but in the way of just knocking a ball
B	yeah just
A	it's
B	it's just yeah no you're right
A	cos he hasn't gotta teach or anything has he?
B	no he hasn't gotta teach
A	so he can just
B	no he just it's just different she wanted to practise
A	yeah
B	certain backhand volleys and this and that and we just we watched him actually because he was doing it while
B	but it was
A	I never forget that time do you remember when
B	yeah
A	presents out? and me and
B	he'd he'd
A	played tennis
B	I know
A	do you remember all them years ago?
B	but no but it yeah
A	he is
B	yeah
A	absolutely a natural without a doubt
B	but he was saying that a natural at at comfortable
A	yeah
B	coaching teaching did he want to do this?
A	yeah but yeah
B	I yes I know
A	yeah
B	and I I said to
A	mm
B	that's all he's ever wanted to do is leave I said if he went back as a job well I said we just
B	wouldn't be able to get over it
A	could you imagine?
B	having spent all his life
A	he wouldn't
B	telling me he's quit
A	I mean like if you think I mean some of the like the
B	oh I know I know I know
A	coaching for all their kids
B	that yes I know I know
A	and all the rest of it
B	well we said we've said to him you know if he wants to go down that route why why doesn't he go off to Spain or somewhere where they really take it seriously and there's lots of opportunities
A	yeah
B	and do a couple of years out there and just see whether it's for him and then cos it's almost
A	like education or go and
B	no go and
A	just go and work?
B	coach go and work
A	work and
B	as a tennis coach
B	decide whether it's really what he wants to do
A	mm
B	and then if you know if it is what he wants to do
A	and from what age could he do that?
B	dunno
A	like would?
B	into it probably
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	I was just wondering if there's any like you know sometimes people allow you to live with their family
B	yeah
A	type thing?
B	yeah I just know he doesn't know what he wants to do
A	mm
B	he really doesn't except he you know he doesn't wanna carry on studying
A	mm
B	it's difficult isn't it?
A	it's really hard because
B	mm
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	he's been looking at a they've they've obviously had a talk at school about
B	mm mm
A	the cost of university and making sure it's what you want and it's not the be all and end all they must have had something because he's like come home saying I don't know whether to do a
B	an apprenticeship
A	you know an apprenticeship
B	I know
A	and I said but but what are you gonna do? you don't know what you want to do
B	to do I know yeah
A	so what are you gonna do with? I said you've gotta pretty much decide then within the next six months
B	six months
A	or whatever
B	mm mm
A	cos that's when you need to start applying what you potentially wanna do
B	it's so
A	for the rest of your life
B	it's so hard isn't it?
A	it is
B	it's so hard yeah dunno don't know
A	maybe just go and just get a job don't worry about a career it's
B	yeah
A	so much harder for a boy do you think?
B	yes
A	cos
B	it is
A	yeah
B	well I mean he wasn't even trying to change career he was trying to change industry you know his actual job role operations
A	mm
B	was staying the same
A	yeah
B	but he found it very very hard to change industry so you do have to be careful what you choose don't you? but
A	mm but then it's like
B	mm mm
A	he said yeah but that could happen to me one year in at university
B	of course it could yeah
A	and I said yeah you're right
B	yeah he could could at any time couldn't it?
A	could at any time he was saying last night
A	a whole decade
B	yeah
A	and just go travelling
B	er well you would
A	it's like a said to
B	oh really?
A	he was working in a surf shop and doing something else and doing something else and now he's got some sort of sales job in engineering so he's thirty what would
B	I don't know
A	nearly six years maybe?
B	have you?
A	so he's
B	so he's thirty-four?
A	yeah and he's only really just
B	just finding
A	settled into a job
B	mm
A	so but he's
B	mm that's great help
A	so he can yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah he you know
B	yeah that's
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah I dunno what I wanna do
B	so what he wants to do
A	I'm still wondering what I wanna do
B	you want a little farm with your chickens don't you?
A	I do I'd love a little smallholding and just have groups of children come from nursery for a little walk around and
B	yeah oh yeah you'd like that
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	just a little smallholding manageable
B	gosh the wind's picking up
A	you know have all your friends queuing that wanna come and stop while you go and have your two weeks' holiday
B	I'm not gonna be queueing
A	it's my turn it's my turn no you wouldn't
B	I wouldn't be queuing I wouldn't want chickens and small kids
A	no
B	no I wouldn't be queuing
A	oh
B	where are you going?
A	like
A	you'll go on holiday and leave me
A	oh erm I I know
B	yeah cos was it last October you it was full? was it last October you were trying to go and it was full?
A	no we went
B	oh you went for the weekend didn't you?
A	we yes we did a long weekend
B	instead of a week yeah I'll I'll ask him again
A	that's right
B	but he can't really do anything
A	I know
B	for a month
A	but we're thinking of doing a a
B	a different one?
A	yeah
A	we've done
A	was it lovely? it's not that far away is it?
B	I think that's a
A	well I know
B	well yeah yeah it was erm
A	but if you if you've got no trailer or anything
A	oh yeah
B	which is nice
A	I'll have to get the magazine out
B	yeah but again if cos it's half term but
A	yeah yeah
B	but it's very
A	I said to
B	he did erm
A	oh yes
B	because his son had erm an inset day on the Monday
A	oh
B	so they went down on the Friday straight from school picked him up at three fifteen was straight down there and he had an inset day on the Monday so that's
A	oh
B	that's the a
A	yeah
B	if you're thinking of a weekend that might work as well
A	mm
B	instead you know if you can't do
A	yeah
B	the half term because they're always popular that's what they did
A	perfect
B	that that's easy to arrange
A	oh we'll have to bear that in mind
B	yeah that's much easier to arrange obviously he would ask
A	yeah
B	but again he can't do it until
A	yeah no
B	a month before
A	no
B	so erm
A	oh
B	yeah
B	I don't know I haven't looked but the you know there's bound to be isn't there?
A	oh I might just leave
B	that's a good idea
A	be nice wouldn't it?
B	it would yeah what age are you gonna leave them here by themselves?
A	oh I'd happily leave
B	overnight?
A	mm I'd happily leave them now
B	would you?
A	just never get the opportunity to be anywhere on my
B	I don't know whether I'd leave mine because they're just so incompetent
A	the only thing that would worry me about
B	she'd really be the boss
A	yeah she's think she's in charge type thing no I'd erm I we've been out
B	mm
A	and we came back and they were both in bed
B	oh yeah we do that all the time that's not a problem
A	oh do you?
B	yeah
A	oh I don't go out that often so
B	oh no we do even if it's only
A	we don't
B	over to
A	yeah
B	they haven't come or they've come but they've come back ealier
A	yeah
B	and gone to bed
A	yeah
B	no that's not a but er but I haven't left them who was it I was talking to? oh it was
A	mm
B	and she said you know did I want to come? like company for her really as much as anything else
A	yeah
B	I said I'd love to come
A	yeah
B	I'm not prepared to leave them for a few days on their own
A	mm
B	they are
A	oh is he?
B	he's rubbish
A	mm
B	he'd just have an accident he's a disaster
A	yeah
B	boss him around
A	yeah
A	no
B	and
A	yeah
B	I said no you don't because it's baking oh yeah but it might get colder later just after his tennis match
A	mm
B	so he went in and the next thing he's going
B	and then it goes off oh my god and it was the loudest noise
B	it was the loudest noise
A	oh my god
B	and I was panicking because I didn't know what to do to stop it going off
B	cos it was quite new still
A	oh
B	oh and it's set so if it goes off it's not monitored but if it goes off it rings
A	oh
B	so he then was on the phone
A	that's clever that's clever
B	so it's not a monitored alarm
A	so no but it rings a mobile?
B	but you can set to a two or three phone numbers that you want it to ring
A	that's clever god isn't that clever?
B	it is actually
A	it is because our
B	have you got an alarm?
A	yeah but the only time
B	I didn't know you actually had one
A	we put the alarm on is when we go on holiday
B	oh really? well it it was only because
A	I mean it was done fifteen years ago
B	oh okay it was only because of that little you know that spate of
A	yeah
B	burglaries which I think er you shouldn't say it but coincided when the gypsies were there didn't it?
A	yes yeah
B	and we haven't I haven't heard of any since they've
A	no
B	been moved on
A	they've gone
B	but anyway so that
A	mm
B	and he spends all day and it you know it's a nice
A	yeah neat box and everything
B	proper panel and two boxes outside and blooming loud erm and he could you know you can set however long you want it to be
A	yeah
B	going off
A	that's clever
B	I think three people
A	that is very clever
B	because I said to him what are we going to do when we go on holiday and it rings you and we're you know
A	yeah
B	well are we gonna ask somebody else if we can have it set to them for?
A	yes yeah
A	but yeah yeah
B	I said oh okay yeah that makes sense
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	but er but no anyway I was I I don't think I'd leave them overnight for any length of time yet too incompetent
A	mm I I'd feel okay I'd probably think oh but
A	she'd she'd get on with it you know
B	mine wouldn't they'd just go to the chippy
A	mm well the yeah
B	with all their leftover their spare
A	well yeah because you get all the leftover yeah yeah
B	that I'm paying that he's not paying
A	no wonder he's happy to do it for five pound an hour he's making a
B	yeah he's making
A	well he's making how much?
B	he's making a fiver well more now isn't he?
A	more than a fiver a week
B	because when yeah because when he hasn't been er back with
A	yeah and and when they paid erm when they paid a pound each that first day that either way a pound each
B	mm
A	either and he sorted that app out he said so I you're in credit for Monday
B	oh
A	so he didn't have anything off them on Monday
B	bless him oh isn't he lovely?
A	bless him
A	yeah
B	I know very few people that put their handbrake on at the traffic lights or whatever but
A	yeah
B	he's you know so he's obviously you know
B	clocking it and paying attention
A	won't before he's
B	no he says he wants
A	gonna start learning
B	mum do you think I'll have passed by Christmas? I said I don't know
A	no he should be yeah if if he gets his first letter lesson pretty much booked in as soon as his birthday
B	yeah and then he's got you know
A	if I were you in fact
B	three weeks
A	if he's got a chosen I'd I'd actually get him booked in
B	get him booked in
A	cos sometimes you know they say well I can't accommodate for a month or
B	oh okay oh that's a good idea
A	it might be worth
B	need to sort out his provisional licence
A	mm
B	arrange some lessons and he wants to have his own car ready to practising cos he can't really he's not practising in mine
A	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah no yeah
B	so that's the the other thing
A	yeah
B	we probably ought to sort that out cos he you know he was always he's got the money and he was always gonna get one to get himself to the tennis club but if he just had it for when he's learning as well
A	you know what you need to do now? you need to reduce the size of your back garden so you can get another car
B	I know it was on my list to have done
A	on the drive
B	by the time he was seventeen
A	mm
B	but it just hasn't because it's expensive
A	you'd only have to move the fence down slightly wouldn't you? and put a gate in just move your gate round really
B	what
A	yeah but they soon grow back don't they?
B	and it's on a different it's on a
A	if you're if you're
B	a a level isn't it?
A	standing on your drive and there's your garage
B	mm
A	then all you need to do really is push that back a little bit don't you?
B	what the garage?
A	no no no there's your garage
B	the the hedge?
A	turn to the side yeah and push your hedge back a bit
B	yes I know yes you do yeah
A	and you don't need to be in fact even the full width of the car cos I bet you could move over slightly to the left if you needed to
B	yeah I know but it's still expensive to do that isn't it? you'd have to have the drive redone wouldn't you?
A	yeah
B	little step
A	mm
B	I don't think it's as it's not something
A	is there put it on the front?
B	how do you mean?
A	on the front under your window you haven't got a driveway there have you?
B	we haven't got a driveway
A	no
B	what we should do is is sort the garage out and one of us should park in the garage
A	that's a good idea
B	because I park in the garage in the winter because I don't like
A	yeah
B	scraping ice
A	on the
B	road
A	yeah
B	I mean to be honest we've got such cos we're cos of being on the corner
A	there's plenty of room
B	there's plenty of room and where people park literally outside our front door
A	yeah
B	doesn't affect any traffic because
A	no
B	it's so wide there and it's on this side
A	yeah
B	it doesn't affect any traffic whereas if you were parked you know you know just before you get to our drive by the trees if you were parked there
A	yeah
B	that I think that's a difficult one because people would have to come out to go round it and if somebody was coming that way to turn into
A	mm
B	that would be to park there would be a hazard whereas if you park up
A	like further up by the door
B	literally on the corner
A	mm
B	you're you're
A	yeah it's wide enough isn't it?
B	it's not affecting anybody there
A	no no there's plenty of room
B	but ideally what we have said is we need to get organised so that
A	mm
B	and two on the drive and have a rethink before
A	I know
A	we can get six
B	yeah
A	easily if you'd like you know
B	yeah easily so you're
A	but we are gonna erm be widening it
B	yes you said that
A	anyway
B	yes yeah
A	and we did think about doing it now
B	mm
A	temporary just getting some gravel or something
B	yes
A	but we've looked at the cost and it's not gonna be cheap
B	I know and that's what stopped us from doing ours
A	yeah
B	because there's always
A	yeah
B	you know it was a toss-up
A	yeah
B	and the bathroom really really was horrible
A	mm you wanted to do the bathroom
B	and needed doing and it was a toss-up to be honest but I mean why getting the drive done has been on my list for many years and it was supposed to be done before
A	cos time just goes so fast
B	mm I know I know
B	it is scary
A	but you forget don't you? if do you ever when you're on the go do you walk past a mirror and go back and think is that me?
B	oh yes cos you're looking a bit old?
A	yeah and you think
A	is that me? can't be
B	can't be
A	I can't no
B	no I
A	talk to myself?
B	talk to yourself
B	I'll be quick
A	I'll shout to you
A	oh dear me I could think about what we've talked about
B	nice towels in here
A	I've got what?
B	nice towels
A	oh thank you
B	are you still talking then?
A	I'm talking I'm just telling you what's going on in
B	beer?
A	a food festival
B	oh food
A	in
B	that's better had two cups of coffee
A	Christmas festival
B	oh my goodness
A	you'll be on your holidays for your Christmas this year
B	oh yeah
A	how's your friend?
A	mm
B	I was trying to arrange to go down and see her but I haven't managed to she's excuse me she's okay
A	yeah
B	but now she's been up to London to see about going on a trial
A	oh has she?
B	some sort of trial that they're doing which is in the very very early stages and she's been going up to London but she's still in the screening phase for that so they haven't said whether she's going to be on it or not and I was trying to arrange a day and she just said to me you know if you can be flexible cos I'm just waiting on texts and it could be any day that they
A	mm
B	ask me to go back up and I said yes I can be flexible and I texted her again
A	mm
B	call her so but I will try and get down there before the end of term for a day
A	yeah
B	and just go out for lunch but I mean she you know she said she was okay they went to Center Parcs for the half term just gone
A	oh so she's
B	she was okay she said she had one day where she was just sick she was really sick
A	mm
B	and she had to stay in bed
A	oh bless her
B	and obviously she wasn't doing much oh there's pigeons going up onto your
A	mm
B	she wasn't doing much but it was nice that she was out she was there
A	yeah
B	three of
A	oh bless
B	I know but you know
A	oh it's horrible isn't it?
B	yes it is
A	really horrible mm
B	so I've been asked to proofread another book
A	have you?
B	yeah so you know that I've got a new customer a few
A	no
B	a Christian book did I not?
A	no
B	oh okay well it I did well a book in
A	did you?
B	in May
A	did you say it was really interesting? and it was about I think you did cos you said it was for
B	but the it was on paper though and I haven't proofread anything on paper since I did my course
A	oh
B	because nobody does that really everybody does it
A	no
B	electronically so that was a bit a
A	fabulous
B	send it down so
A	and this this is from your website? or this is from the
B	no this was erm
A	the other connection?
B	no no this was just do you know probably twelve months ago when I had some time I emailed a load of publishers and just said you know I I'm doing proofreading now if you've got any work or put me on your books and they replied and they said you know thank you for your for your letter email we haven't got anything at the moment we'll keep you on file and that was it literally nothing and
A	wow
B	I don't know if you're still interested in this sort of thing but you did
A	mm
B	tell us this is what you do well we you know would you like to proofread this book for us? so I said yes and then it's then they said it was on paper and I thought god I haven't done anything like with all
A	gosh
B	the actual proper symbols which they use which you know it was interesting kept me kept me on my toes but erm I thought well I must have done a an okay job if they've asked me to do another one
A	yes
B	so that was nice
A	so do they give you date for when it needs to be completed by?
B	they they did yeah I've asked she only emailed me yesterday with this new one and I've asked her what the timeframe is and how much they're paying but last time they said you know we need it we we'll send it to you straightaway and we'd need it back by this date which was er about a week I think later
A	mm
B	so I suppose they have to know whether you've got time and whether you can fit it in
A	yeah fit it in yeah
B	with what you're doing erm
A	and is it the same amount of money they pay you regardless how how long it takes you to do?
B	the yes that was a
A	is it like?
B	this is this is like
A	and a rate per
B	a rate it was three it was three hundred pounds
B	and they said
A	so they cost the job do they?
B	yes they did
A	right yeah
B	and they said do you want to do it for this much money? and I said
A	yeah
B	yeah go on
A	and how long did it take you?
B	I probably spent three days but three full long days doing it
A	but it still equates to a
B	cos I wanted to
A	decent daily rate
B	yeah it's
A	yeah
B	yeah it's yeah it wasn't bad
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's worthwhile
B	not as not as erm well as working for
A	yeah
A	are you still there every Wednesday?
B	every Wednesday yes
A	yeah yeah
B	I did an extra hour this Wednesday just so that I could stay there till
A	oh yeah
A	yeah
A	that's very and got paid for it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I well I I said to
A	yeah
B	I wanted to so rather than letting it slide for a
A	get it all done
B	and he went oh yeah great yeah yeah and that was that
A	bless him
B	so I thought well that's tied in nicely with
A	it's picked a bit now hasn't it his business?
B	it has it has
A	mm
B	we've got erm we're on the front cover of an industry magazine this month
A	oh
B	in
A	are you on there?
B	no no no it's a little picture of
B	no well I sent them the photo and they
A	right
B	and and the article and then they came back with you know they wanted to do a whole load of questions for
A	yeah
B	spread inside of erm
A	good
B	of the job in Scotland
A	it's good publicity isn't it?
B	yeah yeah so so no it is going okay there
A	so who does all what
B	nobody and that's the problem it's an issue
A	mm mm
B	himself and he's not very good at it and he doesn't know what
A	no
B	he's doing and I think occasionally he's paid people twice sometimes he doesn't pay them unless they're screaming for it I was in on Wednesday and I heard him make a couple of phone calls along the lines of hi this is
A	oh
B	and then he asks how much and then he pays er it's a it's a
A	oh god there'll be people out there taking advantage of him
A	oh bless him
B	and then he said to me I said oh
A	would his wife not be interested in
B	no I don't think so
A	working for him?
B	I don't think so
A	can't he employ somebody?
B	well he should have done obviously he should have done we have a lady that comes in
A	but I suppose he
B	from our accountants that do our external accountants once a month she comes and just not quite sure what she does to be honest but he's now in charge of paying the bills and stuff it is a bit of a mess he's muddling along
A	hello
unknown_female	hello
B	hello
unknown_female	hello
B	how are you doing?
unknown_female	good thanks
B	good sweets?
A	been to the sweetie shop?
A	oh
B	oh
A	is there a match on or something tonight?
unknown_female	no
A	oh
B	no
A	thought you'd got your your match
unknown_female	no
A	supplies there
B	got your goodies
A	there
unknown_female	no
B	mm well I'd best walk down the road then hadn't I? and get ready to start my chauffeuring in a few minutes
A	mm when are you eating?
B	when am I eating?
A	later
B	later well
A	so how
B	two hours on a Saturday he does an hour and a quarter on a Friday and that's his regular
A	that's brilliant
B	and then he has he's been covering quite a bit lately so he's done some on Tuesdays he did one on Wednesday night you know there's those tennis courts in the park?
A	yes
B	the there's a new thing now where it's tennis for free on a Sunday afternoon in the park two till four and something on a Wednesday night so he's covered both of those and being paid for that so just
A	that's really good
B	yeah he's doing quite a bit
A	yeah yeah it's keeping him fit at the same time as well
B	it's keeping keeping him fit he's got middle aged ladies paying him to
A	paying him to
B	to bounce the balls
A	to throw the
B	but then having said that er well I think we're gonna have to start charging him I mean he's broke strings again last week that's fifteen pounds
A	mm that's the trouble isn't it?
B	he's had new trainers because he his other ones were falling to pieces cos he
A	mm
B	but it's the strings he keeps breaking the strings and
A	you need to get a machine so you can fix them yourself
B	well yeah
A	you remember I told you when we were out camping?
B	yes yeah I know yeah
A	there was this great big
B	I know
B	yeah a little side line
A	mm
B	it is people at the tennis club who do restringing
A	yeah
B	and charge
A	yeah
B	something else he could do
A	yeah
A	he needs to get invested he's earning all this money it would be worth seeing what it could cost to invest in a machine
B	yeah apparently they're quite big though
A	mm it was quite big it was kind of on a table
B	I dunno where we'd put it mm
A	er no it's portable they were camping
B	oh oh okay yes yeah no
A	yeah they were camping so it's portable
B	worth thinking about
A	put it on a table in the garage or
B	we had one week
A	when he's got his own car he can put it in the back of his car and
B	yeah we had one week about and literally only about three weeks ago all three of them broke strings
A	oh
B	they were all scrabbling around
A	and is it fifteen pound per string or per
B	per racquet
A	whole per racquet?
B	per racquet yeah
A	so if it's more than one string it's still only fifteen pound?
B	oh yeah yeah cos cos the whole lot of strings come out and the whole lot gets restrung
A	oh really?
B	they don't just replace the one that's broken
A	oh so
B	no no the whole lot comes and and you have to
A	oh
B	restring it completely mm I know
A	mm
B	whatever that means
A	mm
B	whereas with
A	just does it
B	just does it
A	oh
B	and in fairness he did say to us well he he was really nice and said oh if only I'd just charged a fiver for the kids cos now they're getting to the age they're gonna be breaking them every two three weeks I thought well that's no reason to only charge a fiver is it? but and we said no no we'll pay you going rate and then I thought every two to three weeks? that's not lasting long is it?
A	no no no no no
B	so and and it and
A	how good a job?
B	only just lasted three weeks
A	mm
B	so it'll be interesting to see now this other guy's done it
A	yeah
B	our other option is to take it into the shop in
A	yeah
B	where he's hitting the ball hard
A	mm
B	breaking strings
A	and I suppose all these
B	yeah
A	I mean is he actually
B	er well
A	playing or is he more?
B	no not
A	mm
B	he's not playing flat out when he's doing his lessons obviously
A	no
B	but I don't know whether it's wear and tear I don't know
A	would be
B	mm
A	seeing how long the fifteen pound one lasts
B	mm yeah he played a match on what was it Wednesday night? was it Wednesday night? yeah in
A	right
B	works in
A	yeah
B	at the
A	did you go in your pyjamas?
B	no but I was I don't think I had any underwear on I'd been in the bath
A	yeah so you were just
B	I was
A	rooting there aren't any men
A	yeah
B	actually but you know as close to
A	yeah
B	I thought I'll be sat in the car park for a minute and then yeah
A	oh
B	but yeah he had a great time over there though he really enjoyed it
A	mm
B	he didn't win he was playing doubles and they only last I think they only got they play four sets and won two games the other two were really good he said mum I played a one point two you know the ranking system?
A	yeah
B	that was from ten down to one
A	right
B	there's a lot of people at one point one but this person is one level up from that he's at one point two he said mum it was he was incredible and it was fantastic play against him we didn't win anything but it was just fantastic to play him
A	experience yeah
B	mm mm
A	and when you see it on television it all looks so controlled doesn't it?
B	I know I know
A	don't you think it looks so like? I know it's like
A	and then like you say they're probably is one point ones and
B	I know the
A	they're probably moving way faster than our eyes or brain allow
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	it's all very fast isn't it?
B	it is fast they've started a ladies' group at the tennis club if you want to take up tennis
A	oh
B	I bet you used to be good at sports didn't you?
A	yeah I was very sporty
B	I wasn't I was never good
A	yeah
B	couldn't do anything but you know if you didn't want to go to the gym
A	I was very yeah no I was
B	do ladies' tennis
A	I was a a natural as you would call
B	a natural mm
A	yeah oh that might be quite nice
B	yeah if you wanna go
A	how much though?
B	oh I don't know I didn't bother
A	that's my problem you see
B	oh yeah
A	I could do lots of things but it's the finances that
B	yeah
A	don't allow it
B	well in a couple of years' time when the kids aren't costing you as much
A	does doesn't it get worse when they move on to university?
B	don't know don't know I don't know mm
A	well what I'm doing with
B	are you giving that to him towards his petrol?
A	yeah cos I've gotta pay for him to get to and from school haven't I? so I still give him his
B	mm
A	but I just transfer it now once a month
B	that's a good idea
A	so he he's using that towards his petrol
B	it's still fifty pounds a month isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it gives him you know a good tank of petrol
A	well yeah it's a good tank of petrol and I'm now paying for him to get
B	I've done ten thousand miles in my car
A	already?
B	I know I only go backwards and forwards to
A	yeah how long have you had it?
B	I think I had it in September
A	yeah
B	blinking tennis club that's all I do tennis clue school gym
A	so what you need to do when you take out insurance for
B	yes yeah
B	you can reduce them
A	you need to take that into account
B	well once he's passed his test
A	for
B	oh yeah yeah
A	saying he's only gonna do ten thousand miles a year
B	yeah I yeah
A	because if he's gonna be getting more in and he's gonna be taking himself to all around doing different things
A	he's soon gonna rack it up isn't he?
B	I know I know so yes ten thousand miles in my car
A	blinking heck
B	I know it's shocking isn't it?
A	the only time I really use my car is for work you know like I've worked Monday Thursday and I'm working Sunday this week I've not been anywhere in my car any other day
B	I know but I mean
A	like you know
B	I don't go far I did go I did go down to
A	mm
A	yes
B	course there
A	yeah
B	and I take him there and I take him the odd place for a tennis tournament that's further afield and
A	yeah
B	but you know by the time I've driven to mum's and then to nan's and then to the coffee shop and back to mum's and back to mine you know I've spent a good while in the car and just even sometimes
A	yeah
B	of an hour in the car and I've only been
A	yeah yeah
B	in a loop
A	er in the loop
B	and I just thought it just goes to show how often I'm doing that and I've done ten thousand miles and you know we're four miles away from
A	yeah
B	four or five miles
A	yeah soon adds up doesn't it? you can see why
B	mm it'll free up so much time
A	like
B	and
A	yeah she's had just about completely
B	it will
A	mm
B	cadge lifts with his brother to the tennis club and so on
A	yeah of course I mean
B	mm mm
A	went to Tesco's together the other night for something
B	yeah yeah but I will have time and less miles on my car
A	yeah
B	I know couldn't believe it
A	you'll be able to do more
B	right
A	more proofreading
B	I will
A	we need to erm
B	oh gosh yes right let me stop this and I'll best go and we'll remember it
