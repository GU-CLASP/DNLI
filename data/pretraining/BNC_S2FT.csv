A	onwards forward backwards
A	right
B	yeah
A	I quite neatly reversed all the way round it now
A	what were you about to say sorry?
B	is this from the erm was it writing on the registration plate
A	okay
B	twenty degrees
A	wow
B	wow
A	this is March
B	yeah
A	it was only officially the start of spring a few days ago
B	yeah
A	see I treat spring as the start of March
B	ha
A	I do not conform to the
B	sure
A	so are the official lines in inverted commas seasons are they sort of all three months long? Or do they vary?
B	erm
A	well what possible use are you then?
B	hmm mm
A	sorry?
B	my useless knowledge doesn't extend that far
A	no it's possible
B	mm
A	hmm
B	hmm
A	yeah I'm just curious
B	mm
A	Cos I think it's a really sort of seasons are quite a
B	yeah
A	well just grey
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so yeah
A	ha a fire station
B	hmm?
A	many many many many
B	sorry?
A	I'm just talking to myself
B	huh
A	yeah
B	yeah I think so
A	we're quite early
B	mm
B	well yeah
A	really
B	hmm
A	yeah okay
B	hmm
A	no but but that was fifty miles away
B	yeah that's what I thought so yeah
A	mm
B	hmm mm
B	yeah
A	okey dokey
B	yeah
B	I'll clean it what time we get back tonight
A	no I would like you to do it in the daylight please so you can actually see
B	alright okay I'll do it tomorrow
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	or at least when you do a crap job of it I'll be able to
B	oh
A	is that a challenge?
B	what for me to? I'm not even sure what you'd be challenging
A	well I'm hoping that I've I say you're gonna do a bad job and you won't
B	huh
A	just to prove me wrong
B	yeah prove you wrong yeah
B	yeah
A	yes you were
B	I was thinking about the erm there was a sign there for the sort of mini business park saying if you saw it it had sort of technical engineers or whatever
A	yes I did
B	it had a sign there saying vacancies
B	that's quite odd
A	it depends if they
B	mm
A	well that could well be erm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I guess no reason why not
A	because it's a low cost means of advertising
B	low cost?
A	means of advertising
B	well indeed yeah
A	yes exactly
B	actually I don't think we've got anyone out of that
A	well we don't want recorders do we
B	ha ha
A	or on where?
B	on the  on the
A	oh okay
B	I think we had it put up on
A	yeah?
B	for that kind of thing you know the number of people who responded for the surveys and
A	medical experiments
B	well I think well I did a scientific study one where I had to um watch videos and kind of comments on things and I think it was to do with language acquisition or something
A	okay
B	well so it was quite good
A	easier?
B	well as in the first task was quite difficult I had to use my brain
A	interestingly I haven't there's not been a single car that I've seen on our side of the road
B	what do they know that we don't?
A	exactly
A	there's not many in the other direction but there have been a few
B	yeah
A	there is of course you you're travelling at a far higher relative speed so
B	yeah
B	right
A	A hundred and thirty or so
B	right
A	so a hundred and forty
B	obviously
A	so like this is coming our direction but not on this road
B	yeah
A	I wonder how long we can keep this up for
B	what and not seeing one?
A	yeah
B	well it's looking good
A	ooh
B	oh oh
A	well now the road's straightened out
B	ah ha
A	one two
B	yeah
A	if they had been anywhere I think they would be walking about
B	mm
A	what are they gonna build there?
B	I don't know
A	just a big man
B	interesting
A	I don't think so
B	will be taking over the world slowly but surely
A	um I think
B	yeah
B	oh yeah
B	oh in my accent it would be
A	oh okay
B	I'm sure there's another one as well
A	right
A	so we haven't actually past any cars
B	no
A	so
B	yes erm really hazy
B	ha ha
B	hmm
A	mm
B	what?
A	this road sign
B	hmm
A	is that a pipe?
B	wow you never see someone driving with a pipe
A	yes indeed
B	like if they're being Sherlock Holmes or something
B	do you know anyone who smokes a pipe?
A	sorry?
B	do you know anyone who smokes a pipe?
A	I know somebody who used to smoke but I know I used to know someone who smoked a pipe
B	yeah?
A	er yeah er er er sorry
B	oh okay
A	er yeah he was a pipe smoker
B	hmm
B	was he?
A	yeah
B	well that's very exciting
A	well it depends
B	ha well yeah true
A	well I still know nothing about cricket and I don't understand the game fundamentally
B	I'm not sure I do
A	I know it's got overs and runs and
B	yeah I don't know what I don't know how the scoring works
A	I thought it was either six or twelve balls and over
B	oh so what's an over? Like a round?
A	yeah but I don't know how any sort of I don't have any sense of how that relates to because you can continue batting for as long as you're not bowled out
B	yeah
A	so I don't see how overs come into that
B	yeah cos
A	no you don't
B	yeah
A	I mean the over is relatively short
B	yeah exactly
A	I was once invited to go along to a game at Lords
B	ah
B	that's
A	well there's somewhere in
B	I'm not sure
A	yep
B	oh
A	but I don't know if it's actually anything else
B	okay
A	mm
B	ah okay
A	sorry?
B	the original owner was called Thomas Lord
A	oh okay
B	hence the name
A	who's the band?
B	um the band is called The Ducksworth Lewis Method and I think the album's called that as well
A	no no no I I I'm not hearing what you're saying
B	Duckworth Lewis Method
A	right
B	and Duckworth Lewis must have been some figure
A	yes
B	yes I was thinking it's something like that
A	right
B	it's him plus a few friends basically
A	mm surely that constitutes a band
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	well is it famous?
B	yeah fair enough
A	no as in you you might have to tell me who they are
B	Pugwash?
A	yeah
B	um I don't have anything by them
A	well that that description doesn't really help
B	I I don't really know them very well very much
B	hmm
A	mm
B	some non-tired cyclists
A	oh dear some florescent cyclists
B	hmm mm
B	mm
A	well you'll have to do that by yourself
B	hmm
A	no bike
B	no but you could hire a bike
A	where from?
B	A bike shop
A	bike shops don't just hire bikes
B	well how about a bike hire place
A	where?
A	oh right I thought you just meant randomly round the countryside
B	not particularly
A	to be fair you can make up a second-hand bike so cheaply I'm surprised it's worth it
B	mm
A	Cos then you can buy a bike for what? Twenty thirty quid
B	I don't really know what the going rate is
A	and then literally you could probably resell it at no loss
B	yeah
B	okay?
A	mm mm
