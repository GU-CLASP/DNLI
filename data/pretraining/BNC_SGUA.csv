A	that's the one thing I hate about the Ipad is she no longer creates things she used to create amazing things from sticky tape and paper
D	yeah
A	she doesn't do that now she does use the Ipad sometimes but I hope that one day she'll find a way of expressing herself creatively using the technology but it's she used to do these amazing Plasticine creatures erm like little
D	really?
A	but she doesn't do them at all now it's really sad
D	she'll get you know you can't be forced to do creative things that's the problem isn't it?
A	no you can't
C	well the more you force the more you dig your heels in and
A	but the trouble is that er that's what I don't like about technology cos it's so erm
A	what's the word? consumer-oriented
D	but then isn't isn't there a point where you would like reject and you go back

C	that's the dictionary
A	last very long though so
D	I'll tell you afterwards
A	yeah maybe after the game
D	but if you
D	you can do it and it's massively helping me out cos I'm really short at the moment
A	is it? oh good
D	yeah
A	oh okay
D	it would be like
A	do you want can we recruit anyone?
B	oh yeah that one yeah that's got just a list of words
A	Scottish?
D	Scottish is amazing if you've got Scottish I'd be like we we're basically we're really after the Celtic fringe we're calling them
A	oh okay Conservative Scottish?
D	that's
A	even rarer
D	do they exist?
A	yeah they do
A	my brother-in-law
E	they did come out of the woodwork a bit
B	I think
E	over the er the vote
A	oh right yeah
A	oh er he's been
C	it's not in here
B	R O N no
C	no
B	so that I can't do that anyway but it probably wouldn't open it up particularly
C	oh no that's ten and fifteen letter words oh it's a silly dictionary
A	how do you spell wyvern?
C	I don't know
B	how do you spell what?
B	I don't know what it
E	thought it was an insect that eats
A	it's a mythical creature isn't it? a wyvern?
B	I don't I don't know it
E	or is that a weevil?
A	can you look it up for me
C	I don't think this is the right one to be checking
A	shall I can I google it is Google allowed?
C	yeah do I'll just move the
B	no
A	that's a worry cos that probably means I've made it up
D	no which
D	we're not really
A	ah I wouldn't cast myself
D	as in
A	wyvern and wyvern's cool
D	are you allowed?
B	erm can I just have a look
D	are you allowed like E G or O G?
B	allowed what?
D	E G or O G?
C	no
C	yeah
D	mm this game's just rubbish isn't it when it gets
B	this is not a good game
A	it's it and it's always bad when the first word
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	is so short because it automatically means you've only got one half of the board
B	yeah
A	mm bath something bath?
D	four five six seven eight nine
A	is bathtime one word?
B	I would think so
D	I picked up these two letters but I can put this
A	bather?
E	oh dear
D	no no I can't don't worry
A	bather?
D	no I was thinking of bathing but it's B A T H
A	I N G
D	oh it's the same as
A	bathing and bathing?
C	it's the accent isn't it? bathing
D	bathing
B	it's the same
unknown_female	mm
B	it actually means two different things
C	it means different things doesn't it?
D	yeah yeah
C	and it's just the way you say it
C	it wouldn't would it? no terrible
B	so your research isn't very good then?
D	no it's shit
D	but it pays me
C	is that is that being recorded?
C	you've gotta be careful what you say
D	it's so embarrassing so someone at work who's recording for us but she's slagging everyone else off and it
C	but she knows she's being recorded when she
D	no she's the recording so there's no you know
C	oh
D	it's like you're an absolute unprofessional idiot
C	oh dear
B	I just
D	it's all anonymous
C	as long as you're not recording this that's fine
D	yeah like just
C	mm
D	say you're agreeing to
C	and do you have to be over the age of whatever?
D	no you can
C	cos
D	you you could erm you could
C	oh no problem
D	and then it's all anonymised and you get
C	eighteen pounds an hour?
D	and you up to five hundred quid
C	and then talk for an hour
A	wow
C	so we could actually get
D	you could do five hundred and you could do five
C	you could fund your trip to
A	well if I if I told them that I'm sure they'd earn the money
C	chat
A	and spend it on something they want
D	but you could all do it for five hundred like
C	yeah yeah to help fund our skiing trip
A	uhu
C	bit late but you know
C	in retrospect
D	yeah it's good money I think it's really good money
C	it is there's a catch
A	oh this is pathetic I think
D	no there's er there's no catch I promise you it's it's it's like university of
C	well we can get all of
A	yeah
D	honestly if you've got Scots the Celtic fringe we're having
A	this is how you spell heaven isn't it?
B	heaven
C	and
D	we're having erm a
A	how pathetic
D	real problem with the Celtic fringe so
B	how many?
A	er I will have four
C	well he's got a brother in law who's Scottish and a sister who lives in
D	honestly we'd
E	lives in
D	we'd love we'd love them to be in it
A	sorry?
A	yeah
C	they'll get
A	yeah I'm sure they'd sign up
D	otherwise I've got to go up to Scotland and make recordings of randomers and I don't wanna do that
B	why Scotland?
D	I'm gonna be sent in a van
C	what about Newcastle will that do?
D	yeah Newcastle
B	why
D	yeah
E	or
A	thing is
C	well
A	the north
D	no it
A	uhu
D	we were a bit worried when
B	W E A R I could do I suppose W
A	where?
B	E A R
A	is bath a word? oh bathe doh
B	where?
C	it sounds a bit random researching I
C	so how many people do you need? I mean
D	er
C	or
D	we're collecting ten million words
C	mm
D	of spoken English
C	oh okay
D	and we're up to eight and a half so we're doing well
C	doing well eight and a half million?
D	yeah
D	and that's like eight hundred hours of chats
B	four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen eighteen twenty-three
C	so ideally we'd just read out the dictionary to you? that's not allowed
D	no no
C	but that would help
A	well done
B	why did you not put bathtime in the end
A	I didn't have a T or an M
B	oh
E	details
A	apart from that I would have done
B	yeah
A	I think I tried but
B	I think it would have been alright yeah
A	no no no no
B	it's a shame you can't fit I M P in there
A	implode I was thinking of plodge but it doesn't
C	plunge
A	I'm not sure anything can work really can it? alode? elode?
B	don't think so B
A	blode?
B	there might be
A	B B L O D E maybe?
B	don't think so
C	plode that's probably a word
D	I've just had shit
B	I've had nothing that I can put down there
A	yeah that's alright
B	at all
A	I I could have but I didn't sorry cos it was
D	okay I'm gonna go here it's rubbish
B	oh yes this
D	oh it's giving you a nice triple shouldn't be helping you should I?
A	oh Asian on good
D	it's a nice word though innit?
C	you shouldn't be helping him
A	yeah it's nice
D	erm
