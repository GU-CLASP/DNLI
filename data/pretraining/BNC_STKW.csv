B	yeah
D	and she
C	he's reliving his childhood
A	oh man
B	but yeah
B	we're definitely gonna make it again
C	I think like
D	yeah
C	probably as a kid I would have
B	it takes like hours to read through all the stuff
C	mm mm yeah
A	Tuscan's are known as bean eaters
A	I just remembered

A	I
A	yeah man
B	what did it have in it?
D	tuna
A	tuna
A	why why is it again you can't have lavender bread in
B	because they had to leave in such a rush
A	that's it
B	didn't have time to let it rise
A	kosher
B	kosher
A	really? wow
A	but surely you can have like like normal flatbreads cos they only take like three minutes to cook right?
B	yeah
A	do the matzah cracker people just have a total monopoly over Passover?
B	probably
A	yeah
C	they had them in the
B	and they
A	cos that's the thing that you get like
B	all that food is like blessed by rabbi's in the warehouse
A	oh of course it has to be blessed
B	so a rabbi'll go around like muttering and down the
C	that's it
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	you'd go crazy working there if it's just sped up recordings all day
C	mm
B	happened when you went to the factory there?
C	just read about it
B	is halal is it similar to kosher?
C	yeah
D	yeah well the blessing and you know the
C	it's just for like the killing of animals
D	yeah
C	so kosher just sounds like it's crazy like like from the beginning
B	yeah
C	like how long things are cooked for
B	well boil three eggs at a time only
C	only only three
A	no I think halal refers to lots of other aspects of normal life as well
B	yeah
A	they're just guide books
C	you might be right I don't know
B	I think I think you'd go totally mental though following all the rules
A	yeah
B	did you watch that documentary about like finding love in Stamford Hill?
A	no that sounds cool
B	there's like this one like
D	the son?
B	no the father

C	right
D	but you have to be a member but you don't have to play golf
C	right yeah
D	but you'd want to otherwise cos everyone would be very like cliquey

D	yeah
B	there's a guy in my secondary school that always used to pretend that he'd had yachts and he's carry round like

D	on a yacht in fucking France
C	only thinks about yachts
A	how did you know that he didn't have a yacht
B	you could just tell he didn't have a yacht you know
C	cos no one has a yacht
B	he always used to talk like he was trading in yachts you know
C	buy yourself some
A	what you do over the weekend? I trained in yachts
D	yeah that's not even yeah
A	it's not the same but
A	boating life for real?
D	before he lived on a boat as well
A	yeah that's true bet he doesn't buy they now
D	no it sucks
B	it sucks
D	and
B	no hot water?
D	no
A	so they can't really wash or wash any clothes
C	is that always?
A	pretty much it just never works it just never ever works
D	unless you have a really good boat with like new stuff they're mainly old
B	can't you use the kettle or something?
D	no what you have to do is you have to turn them both on for ages
A	you can but then
D	and like
A	it's not that easy
D	just have a shower
D	it is shit
A	that's shit they're pretty shit
B	yeah
A	like the toilet bucket whatever it is
B	where do you empty it into?
A	there are spots but there's always like a six-hour long queue for the
B	everyone's chucked it overboard probably
A	so wrong dude
B	they've got a real problem in

C	soon it's gonna be chockers
A	yeah it already is
A	yeah they're all there like at least double-parked
D	and you have to move every two weeks so it's kind of shit
A	but
B	everything else
A	like everything else and then London will never be the same again
D	boating
A	boating life
B	see if I if I had a boat I would get a deal if someone else had a boat and just swap positions every two weeks with that person
C	yeah you can't have the same plot for more than a period of time in a year
D	yeah you can't because as soon as you go as well someone else will
A	praying on it
