A	fifteen quid a night you mean?
A	yeah so
C	but
A	it's twenty-two euros a night so it was
C	mm
A	about seventeen quid
C	yeah but it was worth it because you know
A	yeah
C	if they'd have punched the car as
B	well exactly
C	never got
A	yeah we would've
C	we wouldn't have got
A	wouldn't have gone

B	yeah
C	I bought it it I bought it er very early as well
B	mm
C	I wouldn't mind but your father broke into the children's museum
C	because you
A	oh
C	because you pay the cash desk was ahead of you and the shop was down there
A	yeah
C	but so was the museum so as as all these people were crowding around the desk he said right come and we whipped down there
A	sneaking into
A	the Moomin museum
C	yeah
A	why would there be a Moomin museum in Sweden? it's a Finnish product
C	yeah but Finland is was part of Sweden at one point
B	mm
A	that's like saying France some of France was part of England so we're gonna
A	claim like brie
C	I know I know I know I know but it's no they're very keen on Moomin up there
A	because Moomins rock
B	they are good

B	he wouldn't have been happy
B	no I've gone for a different one but it's
A	uhu
B	it's actually very nice it's a halter neck one
A	yeah I find halter necks much more supportive and flattering
B	mm
C	well when you've got big boobs like you've got
B	the same size as mine
A	no I think that's one size smaller than yours mm
C	I'm a
A	I'm pretty sure double H doesn't even exist
C	double J
B	off the scale
C	double K exists
A	double K
C	mm
A	what's that?
C	actually er
A	how can you be a thirty-four but I'm a thirty-two?
C	because er mine's all out front
A	no but you're wider than me here
C	mm I'm a thirty-four if I have a thirty-six everything drops
A	oh
C	mm
B	it's weird how it works though isn't it?
A	mm
C	that's why I always go to Bravissimo because they sort of don't bother measuring you they just sort of look at you and go oh
A	they do look at you and then they do sometimes
B	mm
A	mm
B	how clever
A	mm
C	they are they're very clever in there
A	they genuinely just look at boobs and know what size you are
B	yeah what a special gift
C	yeah they were
A	yeah they do they have them everywhere
C	where you lift and it says what do you think this girl is? she last bought thirty-six C and you lift it up thirty-two double H and you go oh and she went I never really thought about that
C	you everybody used to grow up being thirty-six C
B	mm
C	that's what we were all told we were when we went to Marks and Spencer's you buy a thirty-six C and it wasn't till I was pregnant and got with
A	it is it is one of those where you think like I would
B	yeah
A	oh and that girl's wearing the wrong bra oh and you'd notice them everywhere like you'd notice
B	you would
A	the poorly fit bras
B	mm
C	well we did didn't we? going round France
A	apparently some people didn't even don't even understand the concept of a bra it was like
B	oh okay
A	boobs everywhere flopping around
C	well
A	no they're not
C	they are they are
C	seriously and and you sat there and you thought what you've gotta do darling is wear a bra
B	mm

C	at the moment
A	oh
B	was she?
A	because she's very tired but still she was very grumpy
B	mm
A	she was a grumpy bitch
C	I think the problem is when people go round
B	yeah
C	but when she felt she feels obliged to do a little bit of a tour with them and this that and the other and she doesn't need to do that
B	no
C	at all because all I mean
B	mm
C	I couldn't be bothered to go round with this lot and then yesterday erm I sat in the park for an hour waiting for

A	are they good looking?
C	two of the two of the sparkies are yeah two of the sparkies are really nice
A	I've decided like that I think dating or marrying somebody in the building trade is a really clever idea despite the fact that your conversations might be limited he'd be able to do your kitchen bathroom windows flooring electricity and plumbing
A	all free yes
C	yes they are
A	so I'm deciding on whether it's worth marrying somebody in the building trade and foregoing good conversation and intelligence
C	some it depends on some of them are quite intelligent
A	oh
C	some builders are quite intelligent
A	yeah
C	because they're they're actually on the design side and the you know
B	yeah
C	they're not that awful
A	so they're not all the
C	no no no no no
A	he became an electrician didn't he?
C	I'll tell you what plumbers are the best cos they need the
A	well that wouldn't be the end of the world
B	well
B	no
A	wouldn't be as bad as marrying like
C	Chinese that would be the end of the world
B	yeah
A	like I dunno like an Isis
C	yeah you could become a
A	a
C	a jihadi bride
C	bride couldn't she?
B	yes
C	yeah I wouldn't want you yeah I keep saying to
A	okay erm I'm gonna take mum out to her car mum bought so much shit it's unreal anyway
C	I did not
A	you did you bought so much
A	coffee and body wash
C	I did not excuse me who bought the cakes?
C	who bought the cakes?
A	cos I'm giving you money for them
C	no you haven't
A	no I said I'm going to
C	I don't want any money for them
A	then don't moan that I haven't bought you half of them oh you're so
A	frustratingly annoying
C	well you're saying the shit that I bought I bought cakes cos I knew that we'd be having cakes when we
A	yeah but you also bought eight bottles of body wash
C	ten
A	ten
B	yeah
A	that definitely
A	has not happened I've nicked one body wash in my life and about nine rolls of toilet
C	yeah I was gonna say let's say the nine rolls cos I came back and there was a
A	er no I no
C	there was a whole packet
A	no that time I only nicked three but over probably the last like year I've definitely
A	nicked about nine or ten
C	yeah I know
A	the odd one or two every time I go home because toilet roll's really expensive
B	it is really expensive
C	and the good stuff yeah
B	yes I
A	but if you go
B	had to buy really shit stuff
C	if
B	this time it was horrible
A	yeah yeah
A	I bought some like slightly cheaper stuff and it's okay but it's like
C	but excuse me why don't you buy?
A	it's not it's not very absorbent
C	why don't you buy eighteen Andrex for seven fifty?
B	quite a lot of money isn't it?
A	yeah it's like seventeen fifty in one go it's just
C	yeah but you only need three sheets at a time cos it's triple and it's
B	true
C	quartered
A	what if I have massive diarrhoea?
C	you only still need the three cos then you buy the Andrex buy one get one free Andrex wipes
B	yeah get some wipes that'll sort you out
C	no but as I say if you buy I always found that like if you buy good toilet roll you don't use as much and it's really
B	it is true
C	and it's really soft
B	it's true
C	and nice and
A	and you don't get like bum rash
C	you don't get bum rash and you don't get bum burn
C	and you don't get any of that sort of thing
B	see this crap one that I bought I had
A	it would be crap
A	crap
