B	you get you get paid to talk?
A	yeah you get paid to talk going out with your friends eighteen pounds an hour of for each hour of recorded material
B	eighteen pounds an hour for the content?
A	yeah
B	that's ridiculous
A	yeah so if you just hit record and like just send it off
B	do they have to be with different people? you just have to give them conversation or
A	so it's for people you go to the pub with just hit record
B	oh don't wanna go through the paperwork er though
A	but it's like super easy
B	what you just email them content?
A	yeah
B	and they send you money?
A	email them content and then you have to get you have to get er do some forms
B	yeah
A	it's super simple
B	sounds good I've got too much on my plate at the moment though
A	yeah
B	that I'm thinking about yeah er yeah

B	yeah that's what it's called yeah and I did er what erm they're great for breakfast
A	yes so good smoothies
B	was doing it this morning and had like two apples a shitload of blueberries and a banana bit of water
A	yeah
B	burst and smashed it down and like just necked it as a thing just like
A	yeah it's like just so
B	fruit it's like with all your fruit
A	yeah it's so good I think it's
B	without eating
A	I think it's really and they're really good for your erm
B	healthy eating
A	the vegany stuff
B	right
A	I'm being broadly vegan at the moment broadly vegan and gluten free
B	didn't you have bacon on Friday?
A	no
B	no?
A	what did I have on Friday?
B	oh no you had the the with er
A	yeah no those two those times excluded actually
B	yes
A	so I made one with like it was like coriander orange and maybe apple
B	yeah I was I thought we had
A	delicious
B	I thought we had a lot more in the house for it but er
A	yeah
B	bit surprised that we didn't our fridge broke so
A	oh no
B	the stocks of stuff were quite low
A	yeah
B	but I I thought we had ginger and I thought we had
A	yeah
B	so it was a bit of a bland one
A	no it sounds delicious
B	but still it was still a hit
A	it sounds delicious
B	yeah
A	I like doing it with all like the kind of just like weird but like like the guy that I used to live with in
B	yeah
A	so like fuck loads of chilli like super fucking spicy they were just good you'd just be like
B	mm yeah it's really good
A	power shot
B	I didn't even have a coffee
A	yeah really?
B	yeah it was quite like
A	yeah
A	bright
B	quite tempted to get one for erm for Denmark cos I
A	yeah
B	eat so badly over there because of the food's so shit
A	mm
B	and like especially the ready-made meals
A	yeah
B	or anything you can get like you can't even get a decent sandwich
A	really?
B	yeah their
B	got like soggy stuff in it
A	oh
B	terrible erm but if I could have that in the studio
A	you'd be set
B	you could probably make not meaty ones but I mean
A	yeah
B	quite like hearty
A	substantial yeah
B	and er and they're quite
A	you can use stuff like
B	and they're quite buzzy as well
A	yeah
B	and they kind of keep you like a good
A	yeah
B	a good energy
A	yeah definitely definitely ah shit yeah that's so true it's all that kind of like yeah I read this really great book erm did I tell you about it? on like super immunity
B	soup?
A	Super Immunity it's called
B	no
A	it was about how all those nutrients and like in like it's er basically like saying that you should completely fucking load your diet with nutrients
B	yeah
A	and like it's like they're the kind of his like it's like vegan gluten free which sounds really annoying like when you say it like that but it basically means like
B	yeah
A	basically just says eat
B	you just have to change what you're eating then?
A	yeah so you just like you eat like fuck loads of delicious vegetables fuck loads of like erm
A	tahini and all
B	yeah
A	and all the milk and like shit loads of nuts and seeds
B	right
A	and tofu and like
B	yeah
A	and it's actually really delicious it's got a very specific taste like
B	I could probably do it for a week but then I just get
A	bored
B	well no it's just like need a bacon sandwich
A	yeah it's very simple but the thing is that you can like that's what I'm doing with it it's just like
B	right
A	you have like
B	days of it
A	they just the majority of like I changed my breakfast like the staple ones and then like yeah and then it's just like
B	erm
A	yours smells good
B	oh yeah
A	oh no
B	she called me last night
A	really?
B	yeah
A	is she alright?
B	she seems yeah she seems alright
A	she had I said to her like the thing is that now I kind of
B	yeah
A	like you know what I mean? she's like
B	she does laugh but she's also erm she is also quite stressed about it though
A	yeah oh yeah yeah no doubt she's more stressed than she's ever been before I think
B	yeah
A	but like she kind of like but maybe she's the way when I see her she's like she laughs rather than cries
B	yeah
A	it's like no the drawing's bad
B	yeah
A	laughs like rather than being in tears or hyperventilating
B	she's not used to being the the bad student
A	yeah
B	yeah so it's I I know what that feeling is like it's just
A	you feel like you're at a completely uphill you feel like you're standing at the bottom of a mountain and everybody else is already halfway up
B	and throwing rocks at you
A	and throwing rocks at you
B	yeah it's horrible
A	the thing is with
B	yeah
A	and once she's done that she will know knock out a beautiful building with like really poetic spaces
B	yeah
A	and be like beautiful and imaginative like she's not she's never gonna be someone who like who loves the theory of like Japanese like society like she's like she will like take all the aesthetic stuff she's seen and the kind of nuance of things and she'll repurpose it like architecturally
B	mm
A	she's like she's very much kind of an architect like she's architecture is her kind of her
B	yeah she's or she's like
A	rather than kind of the
B	I see the building I want to make but I don't know what to put in it
A	yeah
B	around a building that's in your head that's that's gonna cut you in half
A	will it?
B	before you've even got a programme you've gotta build it and then you have to somehow repurpose your programme
A	yeah
B	to the building yeah see er to me it's stupid
A	yeah
B	cos then everything is post rationalised
A	yeah that's true
B	and the whole point of the the the like what happened within the crits especially when like the ones that I've been in recently you have to be able to justify everything
A	yeah
B	if you can't justify it then you
A	yeah
B	and then if you're trying to yeah that's why I think it's hard cos I think she can she can design great buildings whatever but she needs to be able to have a logical method to it
A	yeah
B	and they need to be able to see that otherwise it's like well this is very pretty but what is it?
A	yeah
B	why is it like this? you don't have an answer
A	I don't think it helps that
B	I mean it's er there are so many ways to skin a cat it's completely up to I'm sure there are people who live their whole life the
A	yeah if you go I think she's she would work really well in a studio
B	yeah
A	and then she'd just fly
B	yeah
A	she's been given no site no client like she's been given like mythology what the fuck is even that? like which is so vague some people love that
B	yeah
A	it's not her style is it?
B	I have to find a fucking site
A	what do you mean?
B	got to go to
A	ah
B	or more what I think I'll do is try and go round and identify
A	google earth it
B	yeah but pick gap sites and and er
A	yeah I had a really interesting conversation on sites with someone called from
A	who's been
B	er
A	vegetarian? great thank you so much oh lovely thanks
unknown_female	there you go cheers
A	great
unknown_female	do you need any sauce?
A	er
unknown_female	ketchup?
A	ketchup please thank you that looks so good
A	I love it
A	thank you very much
unknown_female	thanks a lot
B	erm
A	mm
B	what were you saying?
A	someone from
B	what's
A	erm the guys who are doing the one in
B	oh right yeah
A	but he's not from
B	no that's fine
unknown_female	is that alright?
B	yeah that's fine
unknown_female	cheers
B	cheers mate
A	cheers
B	when was this?
A	yesterday
B	yesterday?
A	yeah he was erm
B	what's her name?
A	erm
B	so I have met her
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but she was like mm he was like
B	yeah
A	cos like very like
B	go for a coffee or we could
A	or or
A	I can come to you let's go to this really great pub that I know and er like in
B	yeah
A	and part of me was like is this like a like a
B	a hook up
A	yeah and then I was like is she like setting me up on like a blind date? anyway it turned out definitely not a blind date
B	so what do you know that I know?
A	so strange but he erm he he worked for for for a group called
B	oh do I know that?
A	they did erm
B	okay
A	but he's a really really interesting guy he's so interesting and he doesn't talk shit like
B	mm
A	they're that like and and like the whole the mechanics the planning system makes everything so complicated that you have to like make it your full time job if you wanna do like
B	but that's also what yeah sorry
A	so yeah so he's but no so he's trying to unpack and like make he's
B	yeah
A	erm
B	or you need your company to be doing that
A	mm
B	and if that's what you do then you know the way around the legislation
A	mm
B	and it's and it speeds it up
A	mm
B	and your whole company is about putting this together and getting
A	yeah
B	the people together and
A	yeah yeah I think it would be a really interesting angle for your project
B	that that's what I'm doing anyway
A	yeah but like I think like
B	I just don't wanna touch legislation though I don't wanna go through with the planning
A	no but
B	for this
A	if you're like if like if you like just you kind of state it as your thing like role of the architect as being like
B	developer
A	the developer and navigating all that shit
B	yeah
A	you
B	that's
A	if like
B	that's the
A	if there was
B	yeah I think that is part that's definitely it
A	yeah that's really cool mm and erm
B	you should watch that film
A	and I'm going to I'm going to
B	why is that?
A	because because they just because they're gonna go like they'll go they'll like interview people for the rest of it so it's not like the I think it's really good because it means that it's not self-interest
B	right I see
A	so like lots of the CLTs things like erm lots of CLTs have it's just self-interest
B	mm
A	the guy who set it up he's the guy with dreadlocks who was on that film
B	yeah
A	is like he's
B	what the guy with dreadlocks? wasn't it his father who's got the dreadlocks?
A	yeah I think he has as well doesn't he? maybe not
B	I think his father did I don't remember him having I thought he quite actually quite a well put together
A	yeah he was but I thought he had dreadlocks still
B	maybe
A	maybe not
B	maybe
A	mm
B	the what?
A	the loans come from
B	oh I've read about this
A	and erm the reality check in terms like where the funding will come from
B	yeah
A	they're a cooperative bank
B	yeah
A	and there's like a specific
B	would they loan it to the do they loan it to the council first then?
A	oh do they?
B	I think it's loaned to the council
A	okay
B	and the council
A	yes no that is true
B	then it comes back from council
A	cos then yes that's true that's true cos that becomes a erm like that's the insurance policy
B	yeah
A	basically
B	so how did it end up?
A	er it just it was just like a chat
B	mm
A	I've invited him to come along erm
B	what's your thing? a discussion?
A	so did I tell you about this guy that I met?
B	you've made nine pounds already
A	erm so this guy that I met
B	you could go round leaving like
A	mm you need to get er erm permission
B	oh right
A	yeah
A	erm
B	oh
A	I know I may not have
B	is the company
A	yeah then those two guys erm well maybe actually if you wanna speak to him while you're here
B	er
A	like he's very like I don't know and I had a good like and he was like he's he's still learning about it at the moment as well
B	yeah
A	but so yeah both
B	I think so as far as as far as erm the course goes all I need to know is it's possible
A	okay
B	I think I and I think I need to make sure I don't get too tied up in the fact that it's
A	mm
B	there's problems with it
A	mm
B	because otherwise I'll end up with no architecture
A	mm
B	so it's just showing that there is a way to do it
A	yeah that's very wise
B	no but I want to er at the same time I want to know cos I think it could be a possible new
A	mm
B	so the practicalities are definitely you know
A	mm
B	but I'll need to try and get more for the record like on in interviews and stuff
A	well maybe
B	I think I need to get more about the positivities of communal living and about
A	yeah
B	erm
A	well why don't you?
B	so it's more of a promotion for what I'm doing rather than er
A	yeah
B	yeah but we've got all these problems
A	yeah
B	but then I think there is kind of problems can be
A	solved
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think it's more of a challenge to make it a good thing rather than a
A	mm
B	although in Denmark it's quite erm
A	no it's not
B	say that again
A	like I'm not entirely sure whether they're just doing the actual Walter Segal self-build
B	whether they are? would be surprised I mean it's there's discrepancies
A	or whether they're moderating it
B	I mean no you couldn't
A	yeah
B	you you would never get building
A	yeah
B	that's what's a massive problem with self-builds at the moment there's been no leeway for
A	mm
B	erm if for doing your own for like you know doors have to be certain sizes
A	mm
B	and then you have to have
A	that's really interesting
B	but they're gonna have to that that's the thing with planning
A	they have to relax it
B	that's that's part of what the that's where I think this film the it AA thing is so interesting because it comes at
A	is this the film that you sent?
B	yeah it comes at the housing problem from many different angles showing what's wrong and showing how
A	who made it?
B	it's an AA discussion
A	okay
B	so it's like loads of people sitting round and it's only in November so it's still current
A	mm
B	erm and how perhaps a slacking of the a loosening of planning erm legislation for self-builds and stuff like that could
A	yeah
B	really pick up
A	who said that? who was making that point?
B	he is a he's a planner
A	uhu
B	a young one architecturally trained
A	Finn Williams?
B	yes Finn yeah yeah
A	he's erm yeah
B	seems like a good good soul
A	I really wanna
B	how did you know him? from the stuff he's doing with Novus?
A	Novus
B	Novus
A	I've seen him speak before but he also did he did a lot of projects with
B	mm
A	like he did he owns I think it was the
B	how old is he?
A	super young
B	I was gonna say he looks younger than me
A	super young he's like unbelievably competent but he
B	mm
A	used to work for the I can't remember whether he was a client for I think he was a client for
B	he was a client for
A	yeah he's brilliant though like yeah
B	mm
A	at the AA that's like it's gotta be him
B	is he from the AA?
A	mm no but he's like he's kind of a bit of like a like a darling for like
B	intellects
A	yeah of like for you know the architecture of
B	there's another guy who er
A	who else is on the panel?
B	erm
A	is it like architects?
B	like the guy from erm
A	oh yeah?
B	but he was kind of a business angle
A	yeah
B	and a guy who wrote a book called why aren't we all developers?
A	okay
B	or we should all be developers or something like that
A	great
B	erm yeah bought the book straightaway it's like a must-have books
A	yeah
B	erm er he's he's he's got
A	yeah
B	about architecture will play a bigger role and
A	mm
B	should also be let loose more
A	mm
B	erm to get like ideas out and to
A	mm
B	to actually execute them
A	mm
B	and had the
A	I need to read that book
B	had the point that I made erm that he made er you know if you've studied for seven years or
A	yeah
B	you'll be fucking with someone's head
A	yeah
B	but that's always been something that I I used to say it was stupid by then
A	that you can be fucking with someone's head?
B	no that we're suckers and we
A	yeah
B	study for seven years
A	yeah
B	and we can't even the chances are we won't be able to you know hand over a drawing at the end of it that we can sign our name to
A	mm
B	but seven years as a doctor you can end up slicing someone's head open or it's like life or death
A	so true
B	why?
A	no in terms of like you know like big fucking huge slubs
B	oh right yeah yeah
A	of the building that's just
B	yeah well and
B	yeah and also like yeah we were doing these projects where we're looking at ways to get nice people housed and stuff
A	mm oh yeah
B	mm
A	it's okay though
B	and
A	it's fine
B	tearing down a building that was
A	no
B	and not even
A	mm what do you mean?
B	doesn't even pay us
A	oh
B	and it just
A	yeah
B	sorry?
A	where there's any other project
B	yeah
A	other than our first one A
B	and
A	and
B	if what?
A	if
B	no
A	it can never have been but like
B	yeah
A	I always seem to get that
B	yeah
A	but you know a hundred forty-five in fees
B	uhu
A	it's a hundred and forty-five in fees
B	what what are we on fifteen?
A	twenty overall
B	er six hundred K
A	ten percent
B	sixty grand
A	but you do you don't charge
B	no
A	so it should have been at least forty pound then
B	yeah but you said ten percent when
A	but yeah
B	so eight
A	eight percent
B	eight mm
B	uhu
A	forty-five grand
B	yeah
A	paying for anyway
B	about twenty-five K that could have gone to a studio
A	it's okay
B	yeah but I think
A	I think the the whole thing is like it is it's too
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	can grasp at things now whereas
A	yeah and my god it's so much easier doing like feasibility for I know I'm saying feasibility but it was just like
B	yeah but it has to be that streamlined if we're gonna make any money off it
A	yeah but it that incredible how different it felt
B	mm
A	I was like so anxious about the
B	did we do yeah but there are many
A	yeah
B	and I think also the restrictions on er on er
A	yeah it's a bit clearer isn't it?
B	the restrictions
A	yeah
B	we can't go bigger here
A	yeah that's true that's true that's true
A	everything's up for grabs
B	until we had the
A	that's true
A	yeah that's true
B	but we still need to work on the extensions
A	oh yeah I mean it's like there's like no none of the big questions are
B	no
A	but I'm just like in terms of like the work of knowing like you have to do X Y Z
B	mm
A	these are the
B	they seem quite happy they're they're happy no?
A	yeah really happy
B	mm well it's
A	er?
B	only no
B	no she wasn't when we were doing
A	it's but it's like knowing like like if you've been through it once like it's like a lot of discussions that we had to have the first time round
B	yeah
A	if we have had to have the second time round you know what I mean? there's like a lot of
A	ways of working
B	yeah communication as well
A	communication
B	it's good to see the erm
B	yeah
A	insane still it is exciting isn't it?
B	yeah definitely
A	mm
B	I know but I can email them too and you can wag
A	you need to get like Dropbox on your phone it's so handy
B	yeah but I don't have a
A	oh yeah I'm sorry that is actually
B	what? what like
A	big
B	oh
A	right
B	I've got this one
A	I'm gonna set up er?
B	I've got this sort of
A	are you sure?
B	a mistake cos
A	wait wait wait
B	no but then I had
A	no
