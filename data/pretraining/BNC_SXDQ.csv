A	mm
B	so that's
A	mm
D	where
B	there's only there's only
A	no it's that one
D	erm so that was
A	mm
B	maybe
A	okay

A	that's it
B	it might've been used
D	want me to make it a bit brighter so?

unknown_female	better
D	I imagine that it will be
C	mm
A	we are in the same
B	I think it's the one that
A	that one?
D	the second one
B	mm
D	no
B	no
D	that's where she currently is
B	it's where you are on the
A	oh yes of course it is yeah
D	yeah
A	yes right
B	because it's about the poorest area of London probably
A	it could be
B	no
A	she wouldn't be the
B	cos of the
A	that's it
B	and what about the? dad's then cos that is the same death one isn't it?
D	that
D	yeah
A	oh right?
D	erm
B	no grandma
D	but
A	mm
D	obviously that would be the wrong
A	yeah
D	her middle name
A	yeah
B	so I think he was in
A	mm
B	do you think that's right?
A	mm
B	and I think he was there at until he was at least ten years old
A	mm
B	cos he's in two
A	okay
B	censuses
A	oh right
B	both at
A	well
B	yeah
A	docks in
B	right
C	and and maybe cheaper

D	nineteen 0 one?
A	nineteen 0 one
D	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
A	mm
B	that
D	yeah
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	that mean the next census is thirty-eight
A	mm
B	so it is that one that was
A	yeah
B	that would've been quite a popular name
A	mm
B	so that's in the whole country isn't it?
A	yeah
A	mm
A	yes and
B	yes
A	in fact there've been two

unknown_female	mm mm
C	and
unknown_female	mm
A	mm
D	yes
