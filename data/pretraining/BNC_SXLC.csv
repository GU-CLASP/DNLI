A	right there you go
A	so we the second place we went to was in
B	that wasn't the outlet was it?
A	no it was a little couldn't really barely even knew it was there we were going down road thinking is it taking us to the wrong address or what?
B	mm
A	but we got there found it and erm and it was like this little cabin
C	like a car park with a with a Portakabin in it and that was the office because they're in the middle of like an expansion
A	right
C	and they were
B	oh were they?
D	well somebody could
A	yeah
D	start up you know couldn't they? on their own
B	mm
D	and be erm you know helpful and so on and so forth
A	yeah but a lot of like what that's what he's done
D	you know I mean you don't have to be
A	so we
D	a huge you know
B	campsite yeah
A	so we picked that one because they had a Focus they had a Fiesta which they'd sold yesterday
C	Fiesta but it sold
C	see what else there is
B	had the Fiesta gone as well? cos sometimes you can actually
C	mm
B	look at it even though it's been sold and get some sort of idea
D	mm
A	yeah I think I think it'd gone they picked it up yesterday
C	but they had a Vauxhall Corsa
A	he had a
B	mm
C	they had a Ford Focus which we took a test drive but on retrospect we've realised cos they're one point
B	mm
C	it's just a bit too big for us and it was a big car
A	I like it
C	I know you liked it but it was like felt like you were lugging it around compared to
A	it felt a bit sluggish
C	compared to
A	for a one point six
C	our car
B	although you can you get a you can get a
D	oh yeah
B	Fiesta because
A	yeah
B	small cars are bigger than they ever were
D	yeah
C	mm well this was a Focus
B	that was a Focus
B	right
B	yeah okay
A	so you really liked that Corsa
C	mm
A	Corsa was quite
C	it was two thousand and six but it felt so much more modern than the two thousand and six Fiestas it was really nice
A	yeah it was really nice inside like
C	and the spec cos it was the Corsa design
C	model
B	so have you got more
C	design
A	design? oh okay
B	so you've got more
C	so the spec inside was nice and
B	oh very nice I like leather seats
D	do you remember?
A	see I don't like leather seats cos of
A	no cos I think they they get
A	too hot and sticky in the summer and they're just really cold in the winter they're just always the opposite of what you need
B	oh I like I just like leather seats they're just
A	and it it did have a leather cover on the steering wheel that was quite nice
B	yes so how what colour was it first of all?
C	like a charcoal
A	the colour was really nice
B	oh right
A	it was he said it was blue and I was like
C	wasn't
A	cos he was showing me the MOT and I was like yeah yeah I was like hang on it says blue is that the right car? cos I'm sure it wasn't blue
B	so like black blue kind of grey like a slight?
A	ish
D	what
A	it was a Vauxhall Corsa
D	oh
A	and you really liked it your grandad's always driven Corsas cos he used to work for Vauxhall
C	grandad worked for Vauxhall so
B	oh well yeah there you go then so he's
D	it's funny isn't it yeah?
B	got
C	my
A	did you say he used to be able to er
C	and like they now do
A	they used to be able to see the factories from the other side of the Mersey?
C	yeah because the Ford factory is in Liverpool
B	yes
C	and the Vauxhall factory is in
B	yeah
C	grandad used to joke saying they'd like wave their fists across the
C	Mersey the river that starts coming in
A	whereas I know that dad hated all his
B	well that's the thing he did but then again
A	long time ago
B	two thousand and six so
C	it was
A	three
A	and er they
C	but it's because the mileage was only thirty-four thousand
B	so it may've been
C	the
A	hardly drove it
C	she drove it like a thousand miles a year
B	right
C	yeah
B	oh
A	so I was thinking if we
C	for a bit for a for a less price
B	yeah
A	so
C	we're going to see a Corsa tomorrow aren't we in
A	and we booked one in tomorrow so cos we didn't test drive that one we only test drove the Focus cos we had to get to
B	so you didn't test drive that Corsa?
C	the Corsa no but we'll test drive one tomorrow
A	not the Corsa only the Focus
B	so was it a modernish body shape?
C	yeah it was lovely
A	yeah
C	it
B	yeah
C	looked a lot nicer than the Fiestas of that same year
B	mm
A	yeah the Fiestas of the same time are just horrible
C	boxy boxy and
B	if they were boxy they'll be look very dated now won't they?
unknown_female	mm just
A	absolutely yeah
C	but the Corsa was just a lot more sleek and
B	mm so what size engine was this
D	have you seen have you seen erm a erm
A	Fiesta?
D	er yeah a a
B	Fiesta
D	sort of a more updated not necessarily
C	well that was the last one that we've seen before we came here in
A	that was the last one
C	that was a two
A	yeah
C	two thousand and nine I know it's that's still like seven years old
C	but it's it the it was two thousand and eight was it two thousand and eight where the model got
D	changed
A	mm
C	revamped
D	yeah yeah
C	and since then they've just looked a lot more modern
A	mm mark seven I think
D	they do it was cos they it's going on all the time you see isn't it really? do you remember the time when
B	mm mm
D	do you remember when
B	lady stopped mm didn't she have a Fiesta?
D	she had a Fiesta and it was a white one and it was
D	it was absolutely beautiful and I was so impressed and I said it's really lovely and
A	mm
D	she said yes I'm really pleased with it you know? erm it was white and then all black inside you know
A	yeah
D	electronics and all the rest of it
A	yeah it feels a lot it was really nice looking inside and
B	so did you
C	mm
A	yeah went to this guy's house in
C	yeah it was wasn't a private seller
A	it was a trade
C	it was a trade seller but they're
A	yeah
C	in the in between erm garages
B	okay
C	so he's
B	so was he? how much was that one
C	it was three thousand seven hundred and ninety I think so
A	so I think it was a bit overpriced for what it was because it was a low spec car
C	I think it was overpriced
A	didn't have air air conditioning
B	mm
C	mm
C	but now we know
A	so that I thought that was quite pricey
C	now we know what that style is like so we can try and find
A	yeah
B	and have you got something on your phone that you can check prices? it used to be called the erm Glass Glass's guide didn't it? you your car price guide?
D	yes Glass's
B	yeah so can actually put
B	erm
D	that was the name of it wasn't it?
B	yeah yeah you can put your
D	mm
B	car make and model year in and it will give you a current price
A	well we're doing it on Auto Trader
B	oh right?
A	cos they have like a valuation thing but
B	right
A	just looking at what's on what the competition is for same models
D	they should make it a bit easier for you these days rather than
A	well it's a bit overwhelming
D	mm
A	it's really it's a minefield
B	I think you've got to I think you have to sort of start and think about what you might like and then narrow it down
D	you've got to give them a it's
B	and
D	it's no good being very vague is it? like well er any
A	yeah
B	no
D	yeah
B	engine size because if you
D	mm
B	so and also if you if you want a one point four and you think well shall we have a look at the one point one? oh it's quite nice you then have an underpowered car forever don't you? you don't have it forever but you know for a for a long time you're thinking oh I wish I got a bit more
D	yeah
D	mm
B	sort of
C	well we're looking at that like we're looking at one point two one point two five really
B	yeah
C	think that's probably better for us cos we're driving round the city all the time
B	yeah
C	so
B	well it's good economy then isn't it? good fuel economy
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and you look at petrol
A	well the Fiesta's confusing because their one litre is called an EcoBoost
B	right mm
A	so which means there's more to insure
B	right okay
A	so we're actually better off sticking with our original plan of having a one point two
B	right
A	or it's one point two five the Fiesta for some reason
B	mm
C	we're also going to see a Mazda2
A	yeah
C	they're similar price range to the
B	mm
B	there are some nice looking Mazda cars about
C	yeah
D	what's the Ford Focus? which one's that?
B	that's the bigger bigger than the Fiesta
D	the bigger one?
B	yeah yeah
D	mm mm
A	I
C	you did like it didn't you? but we don't need a one point six litre
A	really big but we don't need it yeah
D	no no
C	engine
C	yeah
B	did you look at a Honda Civic at all or have you not?
C	we we we've done a
A	we did
C	we did and we're never looking at one again cos we love them too much
D	oh
C	and they're too expensive
D	oh
B	are they expensive? cos I can
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos we went you came with me didn't you you know when we went looking at the garage on the main road? erm at
D	at
B	you did come with me
D	what? whereabouts in
B	it it's on the left at
D	oh yes yes I know where Rover used to be
B	didn't it? yes yeah
D	your
A	yeah
D	but his brother erm he always liked Honda I always had a thing for Honda
D	mainly because erm
A	mm mm
D	at that time they built up a good reputation for the engine erm and
B	mm
D	a bigger one that the Civic
B	mm mm
D	erm and he actually had it so long that he had all the
A	really?
D	yeah but then I mean that he'd be an
D	nobody else would do
B	well the Honda so have you looked at any Honda Civics?
B	cos I
A	they're too much money
B	are they too much money?
A	the
B	ah so what year did they change?
A	they're more sporty
C	nine
A	four five six something like that
B	right and they're they're expensive aren't they?
C	they're like six grand
A	the smallest engine you can get on them is a one point four
B	right
A	they're quite big and
B	cos they're
D	so in other words you don't really need one
A	no
D	no no you know what I mean?
A	they're
D	you can
D	yeah that's what I mean you you to get about for what you want
A	no we can we can get the same result without spending as much money
D	yeah yeah
C	it'll
A	someday
B	no
C	like I don't even have a proper income so why should I have a nice car?
C	you've got you know you've gotta live within your means haven't you?
B	you can yeah I no I understand it and well the thing is
C	yeah
B	it's about yeah you're right
C	it's nice to have things
B	with with being happy to settle being being content with
C	yeah like
D	yeah
C	and I wouldn't I actually wouldn't be comfortable driving one around because I just
C	I it it's just
A	they had one where we were it doesn't really match you know? we'd have to keep it on the
D	it it yeah
A	park it on the road and we
D	yes I can understand what you're saying yeah
C	and if we get if we have a Honda Civic now then what is there to aspire to? do you know what I mean?
D	there's always
B	always
A	yeah like the
C	yeah they're one
D	what's that?
C	one eighty tax
A	well that it's the same as your car
C	a hundred and eighty pounds tax
B	that's a lot

D	but then you see it's been messed around with hasn't it? you know I mean after we got it you know we had a problem with the engine and what have you although I think they did it okay didn't they getting the screen alright?
B	yeah
A	want some more crisps?
D	oh I
C	go on treat yourself
A	go on
C	you never have crisps
D	well no I don't
C	so you need to make up for lost time
B	yeah

A	oh yeah?
B	they were
A	they're nice them
C	not spicy
A	okay
C	do you wanna try it?
B	mm
C	it's piri-piri but it's not spicy
B	oh that's

A	well I was in erm Pret you know Pret A Manger or whatever it's called
B	Pret A Manger
A	Pret A Manger
B	Pret A Manger
B	I like it I like it cos they do a nice duck wrap in Pret
A	cos they do the
D	they do what?
B	a duck wrap
D	oh
A	I like those vegetable crisps that they do
B	well that's what I was saying I got I bought from Aldi they they were beetroot erm
D	mm
B	parsnip and sweet potato I think I can't remember what was in them but they were really nice when I started
C	yeah
C	but they're a bit sweet aren't they?
B	mm when I started to eat them the other night cos I was thinking oh I feel like some crisps what have I got? I'd not opened them at Christmas I'd forgotten
D	mm
B	so I made myself put them away
A	do you know why they're sweet though?
A	they've got more sugar and more fat in them than normal crisps have
B	oh don't tell me that
A	yeah cos I
C	yeah but is it not natural sugars?
B	if it naturally occurs I'm happy
A	in vegetables
C	it's do you not think sweet potato's got natural sugar in it?
B	mm
A	no
C	course it has
B	yes it has it will cos it's naturally sweet
C	don't just look at the the sugar on the
D	mm
C	are red on the sugar
B	but it's all naturally occurring
C	but there's no sugar in it I know it's still natural sugar so you still shouldn't eat loads of it but don't just go by the the traffic light symbol like avocados have really high fat but it's not added fat is it? so you need to check the vegetable crisps and make
A	no
B	it's good fat mm
C	it might not be
B	mm they're lovely
A	okay
B	mm
A	try the hummus?
B	mm
A	I think it's spicy
C	tasty isn't it?
A	well I bought some before Christmas I think at or I remember it was
B	so
C	mm
C	Marks And Spencer's one's made with olive oil
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	very nice so
D	yeah if you lose your car keys and you've got a
A	is that all?
C	is it?
B	well how do you how do you come by this information then?
A	think it's about the same yeah
D	cos
B	he's lost his keys
D	no erm
B	the
D	yeah must've been then because that's the only thing that I've done do you remember?
B	mm
D	I
B	I don't think you've lost it lost it have you? it's somewhere here
D	no no I thought it was in the car and yet even at the car wash nobody's found it and it's never turned up mind you I don't clean it do I so?
A	it was in there last time I went I drove it
D	yes because erm when that happened I had to get the chap across the road to erm
B	well maybe we should retrieve that mum because you know when I said to you have you anything of value in the car? you know when we couldn't lock it?
A	oh right okay
D	yeah
B	and you said no
A	not locked?
B	no
D	yeah
A	you can lock it by putting the key in
B	I did but the passenger doors don't lock so it's locked the main
A	really?
B	no that was the thing cos I thought the handle I thought if sometimes you can press the handle in can't you on the internal doors and that locks it? but no
D	yes used to be able to in the old days I don't know
A	and there's no key on the passenger side?
B	no cos I I tried the back doors as well and they were perhaps you can have a look cos I do feel a little bit and if your remote's still in there about thirty pounds each for one of those so you don't really want to whereabouts in the car is it?
B	yes I know but whereabouts in the car is it?
D	in the little well
B	so you have got something of value in there
D	just
B	that is
D	I suppose so I never thought about it
B	okay well I'll go and retrieve it then
D	don't be going there
B	scarily
B	have they? oh well well I didn't I didn't know I think they'd been thinking not
D	who's this?
D	oh
B	they said they weren't gonna have a look at one because they said if they do
B	they would they would be tempted to buy it so what have have they only done that today?
A	er yeah
B	oh right well I'd emailed her the other day you see and it cos it's her birthday tomorrow isn't it?
D	yeah
A	yeah just I was saying yesterday I forgot to
B	mm
A	damn not still not posted a card today
C	yeah I didn't know it was her birthday
B	tomorrow
D	your great grandad's birthday
A	is it?
B	mm
D	first of February yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	have you ever done? have you ever researched your family tree or anything?
B	I've begun
A	did you?
B	I'm at it I did it through was it Genes Reunited? or was it?
D	oh
B	your credit went down and I think in the end I I kind of gave I printed at the time quite a few bits and pieces which I've got somewhere
C	mm
D	you have to wait till your retired to do that
C	got all the time then
D	mm
A	yeah I downloaded an app but I've not really erm spent any time on it
B	it it's actually useful to ask questions because I think I asked you at the time
D	yeah but
A	and birthdays and
D	I don't know very far
B	mm
B	but it's good it's useful
D	cos I mean my grandparents er were dead before I you know before I was born so erm I only know little things like my mother's mother died at
B	oh did they? I don't think I've heard that before
C	really?
D	she usually says that when I
B	ah so what happened then?
D	I've no idea you see when you were little you weren't supposed to ask any questions and I mean I wouldn't think what we're going to do we're here at
B	were you there though?
D	mm?
B	were you there?
D	I suppose so cos my mother would be there with her so she'd have to do something with me
B	so what year did she die?
D	oh crumbs
C	wow
D	six and and and this is all guesswork and
B	so you don't remember her at all?
D	no no
B	what was she called?
D	I don't think I know I only know my
B	no I know that but what what?
D	that was a Scottish connection because her father apparently came down from Scotland it must've been when there was no work or something to work on the railway in Manchester that's that's all I know
B	so which railway did he work on?
D	oh heck
B	no I know
D	my mother never told us anything really and like my father wouldn't've told you well wouldn't've dreamt to ask him then because he would be so horrified that
B	mm
D	people didn't ask then it's only now when children ask about weddings or anything
B	yes
C	my my grandma was saying the same thing when we saw them at Christmas
D	mm mm
C	was in the war and when he came back he never talked about what happened
B	mm
C	apart from to my to my grandma's dad
D	yeah
C	and my and er I think my grandma's grandad as well
D	mm
C	and she was just like well you know we didn't ask him what had happened like
B	you you would think why didn't you ask? but
C	yeah but you're just
B	you you wouldn't
C	you're just brought up not to know that if you did ask you'd been in trouble so you just
D	yeah
C	didn't and also it it wasn't the done thing to for men to talk about like kind of manly
D	they
C	things with
B	mm
C	I suppose
D	they just talked with men
C	yeah like you didn't
D	mm
C	didn't even share things with their partners
B	yeah
C	with their wives
B	mm
C	really
B	no
C	but
B	well
C	it's different now isn't it? well slowly getting there cos a lot of men still
D	yeah yeah
C	struggle to talk about things don't they?
B	yes they do
C	cos it's the it's the culture but I think it's getting cos that's why there's really high levels of
B	yeah young yeah
C	yeah
B	is suicide between the ages of I don't know it's like something like eighteen and
C	eighteen
D	mm
B	sort of late twenties whatever it it's it is the biggest cause of death suicide which is tragic
D	mm mm
C	yeah cos they're just
B	and you think in this day and age but I suppose it also depends on
C	mm
B	with your parents about things
D	but you didn't talk to your dad about the war did you?
B	yeah
D	did you?
B	yeah
D	well then there you go
B	but my dad was one that would would talk about mm
D	he were he was ah because
B	mm
D	lots of people didn't
unknown_female	mm
B	I did that the other day
D	there was only you there?
B	yeah
B	I was just thinking how did I do that? I missed my mouth
B	yeah
C	I remember
B	mm
C	lying on on the grass in the sun once one summer and we were at a festival or something and for some reason I thought that I'd be able to have a sip of my drink lying down
C	do you remember that?
A	yeah think so
C	cos I just though this is totally normal I'm so relaxed
C	obviously I just poured it all over my face
C	it's like how did that happen?
B	you were so chilled you weren't actually thinking about it
B	yeah
B	well my dad was a talker wasn't he?
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	he really was so
C	that's good
B	he was that was it was good and it was but that was probably more bit more unusual
C	but but do you think do you think men like your dad maybe were seen as a bit
B	maybe he might've been been considered I don't know do you think he'd be considered soft not eccentric but you know he I don't know
D	well I remember I remember
B	mm
D	and then after the war we'd all got married
B	mm
D	made meals and what have you er and I remember my
B	I think if you got caught they didn't want to get caught did they?
D	that was the fear that's what it I remember him saying
D	and he was a radio
B	they were if if they were
D	mm
B	think he was a
D	a wireless operator
B	a wireless operator
D	and I remember him telling me a bit about you know they dug the trench however many feet down they had to be and he'd be on the radio and he said you could hear them screaming they were kind of surrounded more or less in this area and and then the Japanese didn't
B	no but you
D	mm
B	I I'm safe and you probably feel guilty you probably do
D	mm
A	mm
B	I can understand it's a natural
D	this is when they talked about nobody wanted to be captured because they knew the reputation of the
B	they were very cruel weren't they?
D	mm mm
B	very cruel
D	and I mean they went in in these gliders and that's where that photograph of er Charlie Chaplin who you might or might not have heard of
B	yeah I've heard of Charlie Chaplin
D	and that's that's his erm
D	co-partner in in the
B	it was a co-star
D	I don't know which film it was cos
B	think The Kid wasn't it The Kid?
D	I don't know
B	yeah
D	I only know about that other one where he wrote the music of it you know?
B	but that's Jackie Coogan isn't it?
D	oh
B	when he was a child star
D	yeah and he he was the pilot of the glider that took them in what they did when they were going into the jungle they they they cleared two two areas for them to
D	yeah
D	Chelsea or I don't know
B	that doesn't ring a bell
D	I don't know but that was what they called them and they took them in in the gliders and unfortunately when they came to land a lot of them crashed and they lost a lot of people just like that
B	I have I have
D	what was he called?
B	well it was a glider wasn't it? but I don't really think
D	I suppose it was well what were they made of? I mean why did they? I suppose they perhaps there must be a reason they had to be like that cos otherwise I mean they it's just like wood isn't it you know that would just crash? I don't know but anyway he was a a a the pilot of the I think that was the idea why you bought the picture for him really wasn't it
B	yes well it was a picture of the aeroplane the erm
D	that pulls it the one that pulls it
B	yeah yeah not the not the Lancaster Bomber the erm oh my goodness why can't I think of the name off the top of my head?
B	what was the plane? what what was the plane?
D	Dakota
B	Dakota mm yeah
D	that's American wasn't it? the Dakotas yes yes it was
C	Dakota is a state in America
B	mm
D	that's right that's right yeah
C	it's where the the plains are it's like Middle America where it's
D	yes the plains there was a song wasn't there about the? it was like a cowboy thing you when they're jogging along and there's something about the plains of the plains the plains of Dakota
C	yeah
D	I'm riding through the thing you know
C	yeah Dakota's where a lot of the Native Americans rode around
D	mm
C	and where their descendants still live now
D	I suppose so yeah don't hear much about it do we?
C	no I've researched Native Americans quite a lot
D	oh have you?
C	yeah
D	quite interesting I should've thought
C	it's really interesting but it's also really sad like how they've been treated
B	how they've lost their land
D	yes yeah
C	lost all their skills in relation to the land cos they were master horticulturalists so when
C	they they were erm
D	horticulture?
C	yeah
D	mm
D	mm
C	like could even be
D	yeah yeah yeah
C	they were doing all of that and and when erm when Cromwell and his gang and
D	they took
C	the the the story of how how it goes is that they they battled these kind of harsh lands you know and
D	oh right
C	so they just came in and they were like wow these were amazing pastures but it's because the Native Americans had already done it
B	because it had been done yeah
C	yeah
D	was that the story of erm
D	erm Of Mice and Men? Steinbeck's book have you read it?
B	oh no
A	I've not read that no I think
B	no
C	I didn't do that one in school
B	I've not read it
D	I've not read it but I mean they made a big film of it and it was at the time in those days I mean all these film stars they all jumped on the bandwagon and all went into the cowboy films you know?
B	mm
A	mm
D	there were loads of cowboy films all the time if you went to the pictures on a Saturday morning or a Saturday afternoon there was always a cowboy one on
A	yeah
D	you know a John Wayne or all of those they were like the young ones in those days yeah
C	I quite like some of the cowboy films the older ones
D	yeah
B	I well
C	they're a bit slow
C	they're a bit slow
B	well I think cos I used to watch one or two
D	yes yes
B	when I was a teenager
D	cos there was a family
B	just yeah that was a
C	yeah
B	so it was like a series but it was all erm

C	oh

B	and now you can yes and now you can watch online
C	we can access anything we want
D	yeah
C	whenever we want and we still love to go to the cinema for the experience
B	yeah yeah
C	and to see a film when it's just come out and you can't watch it any other way
D	mm
A	enjoy it as part of an audience
C	yeah
A	which is nice
C	but
C	but it but it's not the only way that we can get that information
B	yeah
C	is it?
B	so it's just good sometimes if you've missed something to watch it later down the line so last night for the first time and I actually said oh can you tell me when this was released please? cos I'd never seen it I actually watched Pulp Fiction
C	did you?
B	erm
C	I think was it nineteen ninety?
B	it was ninety
A	ninety-two?
B	it was ninety-four I think
C	oh right
B	I think it was ninety-four cos yes it was er ninety-four ninety-five ninety-five
A	yeah cos Reservoir Dogs was ninety-two
B	we yes
C	mm
B	was it? well I hadn't seen and I was I was there thinking oh my goodness
A	so what did you think?
B	I did enjoy it yes it was
A	yeah?
B	yeah yes there were some bits of it that I and I thought oh why am I liking the real girly bits? but
B	one of the bits that I loved was
A	Jack Rabbit Slims
B	out to yes and they sat in this car
A	yeah
B	this film you can sit in the car and there's like a a diner place which was a club type thing and
D	yeah
B	and have a meal or whatever and then there was a competition to dance and it was the twist and I just that was just such a good little bit watching
C	she's so classy isn't she?
B	isn't she amazing?
D	who was
B	it's
C	Uma Thurman
B	mm
D	oh yeah
B	and John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson
D	oh
B	and so I was busy watching that thinking this is really good and then
C	she's just so chic in just her men's white shirt and cigarette pants
B	so cool absolutely amazing and then and then later the she was dancing to erm it was Neil Diamond wasn't it? Girl You Will Be a Woman Soon
A	yeah
B	which was another song I really really like erm but he was just it was a very good film and that was when
D	oh
B	movies and I didn't know that so I'm learning these things it
D	yeah
B	was good
A	he's the narrator in erm
B	The Hateful Eight?
A	yeah that's it
B	yes
B	no
C	I did for The Revenant though?
A	yeah you did
C	the we went to see Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant
A	oh was that good?
C	amazing
B	oh really? it's a really good film?
A	really good
C	it is
A	yeah really good
C	it's like one of the best films I've ever seen
B	really? does it have a good story?
A	it's set in the
C	yeah
A	First World er no not First World War like eighteen hundreds
C	in America so when
A	Civil War
C	the Civil War yeah
D	mm
C	so the
A	French are over there they're
C	and the Native Americans
A	Confederates
A	yeah
C	and erm
A	dunno don't think so
C	but he fell in love with this this isn't in the film storyline this is in the past
B	this is the history of the? yeah the backstory
C	yeah erm so he's got he's got like a teenage son who's mixed race and Leonardo DiCaprio is part of a group of Americans who are who are just erm out in the wilderness hunting animals for their skins
B	oh
C	for the furs and that's
A	pelts
C	the
A	do they call it?
B	pelts?
C	pelts
B	anybody coming from
B	mm
C	woman in the tribe
B	yeah
B	oh I think this is the thing I've heard about the
C	it's the scariest thing isn't it?
A	yeah yeah really scary
C	and the bear nearly kills him
C	and it's
A	yeah
C	like it's you'd think it was real
C	like
B	cos just recently there was there was somebody who escaped a bear mauling
C	really?
B	yeah and they had a a phone in and they were discussing it erm on the radio they were they had a whole half an hour as erm I think he's
B	and what what somebody said was well as long as you can as long as you can run faster than whoever you're with you're alright
B	but yes
B	erm but it was really and one of the things was were you supposed to shout I think you're supposed to shout at it don't try and run cos they
C	oh my god
B	I think that was
C	I dunno what I'd do I'd just freeze
B	or bear spray that was the other thing you have you don't go without your bear spray
B	think that's it
C	America's so scary isn't it? like there are things in America that can kill you we're so lucky in this country
A	predators
D	mm
B	that we just have
C	there's mountain lions in America
A	yeah
B	yes yeah
C	stags that could kill you
B	well maybe they have a erm a a
C	yeah
B	lion spray
C	yeah
C	you need it
B	whatever yeah but it was kind of yeah
C	you're safe in New Zealand there's only flightless birds
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	might pull your car to pieces
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so so Leonardo DiCaprio gets mauled by a bear and then he gets found by his crew
A	mm
C	by his crew and he's you'd you'd you'd think that they were just like I don't know put him out of his misery because he's that messed up he can't even talk because his throat's been all
C	it's it's really gruesome
A	cos he
C	he's the only one who knows
A	he knows the area
C	knows his way around because he lived with that Native American girl for so long
B	oh right okay
C	he learned off the Native Americans and he can speak the language and everything
A	so they they need him to get out alive
B	so they patched him up
C	they patch him up
A	they they carry him
C	but then but then
C	because obviously they don't like Native Americans because they're constantly being like attacked by them
A	attacked
C	erm so Leonardo's just trying to look after his son all the time
B	mm
C	and there's this one guy who's played by Tom Hardy who's just nasty isn't he? he's like the leader the the supporting erm character
A	ruthless
C	he's so ruthless and he just doesn't care and he just wants his money because they're all getting paid large amounts of money to be out in the wilderness getting these pelts and that's all he cares about and he
B	we need him we
C	so they're just carrying him he can't even talk his all his they have to stitch him up there and then
B	oh
C	because his back is just like
C	open can you imagine?
B	oh no
C	can you imagine getting attacked by a bear? like that's how strong they are
B	oh yeah er well they'd normally kill wouldn't they?
C	yes
D	this wasn't erm in the Oscars was it?
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
D	I thought so cos people were commenting there's er
C	yeah yeah
D	and also somebody else commenting in the paper about how rich he is
B	who Leonardo DiCaprio?
D	mm
B	oh has he?
D	cos
B	cos he's nearly is he nearly forty? I was amazed and then I thought well I suppose he
D	well you know I mean
B	when he was in Titanic he must've been
D	yes yes
B	a little lad
D	so time's gone on
B	yes
D	they were saying how rich he was I've forgotten how many millions or billions or whatever yeah
A	could be a lot quite rich yeah he's never he's never won an Oscar though
B	but it's highly recommended then?
C	yeah it is very good
B	did you? did you both enjoyed it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	best actor best supporting actor
D	mm
C	yeah best
A	loads
C	best like best hair best makeup
B	oh right
C	because obviously the fact that you believe that it's real it must be well
B	yeah
A	costumes
C	cos when I heard that they'd been nominated for that I was like why have they been nominated for that? like they all looked like they all looked awful
B	but that's just
C	but then it was like erm yeah cos they're actors
B	it's believable yeah
D	mm
B	that's really good
C	I'm not gonna tell you what
B	no I was gonna say cos like no
C	I wanna tell you everything that happens but I don't think I will
A	spoil it
B	don't don't because I will I will watch it
B	that sounds it sounds really good
C	I dunno
B	is it quite a long film cos they're making films
A	yeah
B	a lot longer in length aren't they these days?
A	yeah it's a long one
B	yeah
A	it's worth it though
C	it's really it's quite like dreamy and there's a lot of going back in time and coming forward because he's so messed up
B	yeah
C	after he gets attacked there's a lot of hallucinating and a lot of kind of like dreams and visions and stuff back to cos his cos his Native American wife like erm at the start you realise that she's not around anymore like something happens to her
B	oh
C	like so there's he's always kinda dreaming of her and she's always just around and she's quite like fairylike isn't she?
A	yeah yeah
C	it's
B	oh
C	it's it's really and the music's amazing and
A	yeah said it's the hardest role he's ever done
B	really?
A	and he had to learn how to do all the
D	mm
B	mm
C	cos he's a he's a method actor isn't he Leonardo DiCaprio? so he really does get into his
A	yeah
C	role
B	good for him so is it still on at the cinema or is it? is it?
C	yeah er yeah yeah
A	think so yeah
C	it was on last night cos when we a couple who I served last night they'd just been to see it
A	was it?
B	oh
C	and the guy goes
B	exactly half an hour
B	oh
D	what's it called?
C	The Revenant
D	oh
C	what does the word mean?
A	it means erm someone who's like come back from the dead
C	yeah
B	so good title then good er yeah very good
A	mm
B	mm
C	the director we've got a few more of his films now haven't we?
A	yeah
C	to watch
A	he's a Spanish guy is he or something?
B	mm
C	have we seen any of his other films did we realise?
A	there was one
C	there was one that we had seen
A	can't remember what it was
C	cos that was also really dreamy wasn't it?
A	maybe
C	don't think I remember now
D	in the old days they used to have change the cinema halfway through the week you know?
B	you can't believe that can you? halfway through the week?
D	yeah mm
B	well I think it used to be that things were on for quite when I remember them being on for quite a long time obviously
D	mm
B	it's gone back
D	mm
B	a little bit to how it was because now they're not on for very long you usually have to
D	yeah because I was
B	grab the moment and go
D	when one of the Scouts
C	yeah
D	they used to pull his leg you know cos he'd always seen all the films and
C	I
A	yeah
C	love going I find it
B	have you been to the new
A	we've got
C	yeah
B	mm
C	by
A	First is called or something Number Number One or?
B	is it good?
C	yeah it's amazing the building
A	really nice yeah
C	we went to see the Amy Winehouse film there last year
B	oh did you enjoy that?
C	yeah I loved it
A	yeah it was great
B	oh
C	my mum watched it actually recently and she rang me after
A	did she?
C	and it's really sad cos she can't listen to Amy's music now and she
B	oh
C	loves Amy Winehouse
B	yeah
C	but it's cos the films have
B	oh
C	I was like well mum just listen to the music and just remember that when she was making the music she was really happy
A	oh
B	yeah
C	cos that's what she loved doing she was like oh right I'll try
B	mm very talented such a waste and and were we
C	twenty-seven
B	twenty-seven cos it was Jimi Hendrix
A	Kurt Cobain
B	Kurt Cobain
A	Janis Joplin
C	Jim Morrison
B	yeah and all these people who died young
C	something happens in your brain when you're twenty-seven
D	you've grown up
C	yeah but your brain
B	does it?
C	yeah
B	it's a physical change?
C	yeah and then if if your cycle it
A	was it plasticity
A	in your brain starts to
C	but if you're at a stage in your life where
A	mm
C	because at twenty-seven it's a funny age cos some people are getting married and having kids and some people are really doing well in their career at that age
B	mm
C	and then if you if you don't quite fit into any of that and everything around you
B	if you see other people and you feel as though you've not achieved a lot
C	yeah
B	mm
C	it's quite an unstable time
B	yeah
C	they were at a stage in their career where they were being forced into areas forced in a direction they didn't wanna go
C	like
A	yeah
C	Kurt Cobain he was
B	cope with it yeah
C	same with Amy Winehouse she was forced to carry on going on tour and she couldn't get back in the studio and do what she loved which was just writing songs and the same with Jimi Hendrix he couldn't play his guitar for a week or something around the time that he died because he was like in between flats is that right? was like in between flats is that right? he was like in between flats and his guitar wasn't with him and all he wanted to do was just
A	not sure
B	play
C	be by himself and play his guitar and he couldn't
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I can't kind of compute the fact that these poor people have just
C	couldn't
B	ceased to live
C	yeah
B	and and the talent and
C	yeah it is really sad
B	and then Terry Wogan died this morning and I know he was at the other end of the spectrum but I just think it's such a sad thing and we were talking about it and
A	yeah
C	oh
B	he has cancer they said just a short battle with cancer
C	another one? another one?
B	yes well he he was he was
D	cos he didn't do Children In Need this time did he?
B	he didn't present Children In Need last November
D	which apparently heard somebody saying to me that was the one thing that was erm the most important to him
B	to him and that was kind of very last minute because didn't Dermot O'Leary stand
D	think so
B	in I think for him?
D	oh
B	and there were there were lots of people saying oh you know
D	he worked for a bank didn't he in in erm?
B	in Ireland
D	in Ireland yeah
B	well he was just such a lovely man and he was just so entertaining and so amusing and just he was just erm
D	he wasn't one that would get on your nerves like a lot of them you think oh crumbs you know
B	not at all
D	mm
B	yeah very sad
D	mm
B	cos he cos he was I was thinking something made me think about him the other week I was thinking about him I don't know what made me think I don't know but I was thinking about him and thinking how good he was and
D	mm
B	then sad news this morning I thought no
D	mm
B	good it was like that Richard Madeley was then
D	no he's not my favourite but I read a little piece he's standing in for somebody and whoever was writing the article
B	they do do that
C	and they and they try and pre-empt a lot
D	yeah
C	sometimes
D	yeah
C	er it's usually when the interviewer is they're not just a journalist are they? they're a TV radio personality themselves
D	mm yeah
B	well like I well I would just say Jonathan Ross because er I don't like Jonathan Ross
D	no
B	and I just think he's so full of himself and usually when he
C	yeah
B	he
C	yeah
B	you know you're just too egotistical I think he is but
A	mm
B	and other people may disagree but he's not
C	yeah a lot of them are like that though I find erm Lauren Laverne I don't know if you know who she is but she
B	no
C	she's done a lot of stuff on Channel Four but she's got a radio show on Six Music she's big into her music
B	oh
C	she used to be in a band when she was a teenager so
B	right okay
C	erm but I find when she interviews bands and musicians she
C	no not at all like you just need to ask
C	ask
C	yeah
A	some leading questions yeah
B	oh
C	leading questions that's what they do
D	yeah but somebody must think
C	yeah yeah
D	if they keep employing her then it somebody's wrong aren't they? you know if they aren't if they
C	they probably get the ratings so that's all they care about isn't it the bosses?
D	I suppose yeah
C	getting the listeners
B	but is it about that radio presenter or
D	well
B	whatever's personality being
D	yeah
B	so I don't know I mean what can I say?
D	people like it or they don't like it?
B	yeah so therefore they
D	mm well that's the thing with all of us really isn't it? you know we could like or dislike the same person
C	yeah
D	you think why don't they like them? there's nothing wrong them and
B	well it's just it's just about whether you gel or not
D	yes
B	and it's like with just through life there are people you like and people you don't like and that's just
D	mm
B	how it is and
D	mm
B	you know you have to be at times erm just take a step back and be professional and think right well I don't like them but I've got a job to do so
D	mm
A	mm
B	just
D	mm and then I always think I wonder how long the erm you know before they before they come out of the green room shall we say
B	well there probably is quite a bit of that because
D	well they have to
B	well not only that but it's too personal and and journalists will just probe and probe won't they?
B	and they'll ask them any personal thing
C	mm yeah
B	cos nowadays there doesn't seem anything that's
D	that they can't get to
C	well it depends what the dynamic is doesn't it? if it's a super super famous person like Leonardo DiCaprio he can turn down any interview he wants cos he's already loaded so his manager will say we're not talking about this we're not talking about this we're not talking about this and the TV show will just be like yeah okay cos they're just happy to have Leonardo DiCaprio on cos it will get the ratings
A	mm
B	absolutely
C	but where if if if it's someone who's quite unknown and just wants to get on TV to publicise themselves then they've not got as much of
D	yeah
C	clout
D	yeah yeah
C	they'll just say well we won't have you on there
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and they would say yeah yeah yeah that's fine you can talk about whatever you want
A	mm
C	yeah
B	we'll have you
C	they're just so happy
B	ah
C	to have him
A	yeah
B	well that's another thing about Terry Wogan because he had he used to do the interviews didn't he on
D	well Terry Wogan did a children's thing first didn't he?
B	I don't know what he did first but he did do an
A	rings a bell
B	yeah he did
D	yeah I can't just remember
B	and then cos I remember him doing
D	I don't know
B	I seem to remember Terry Wogan
D	yes
B	and Les Dawson and I can't really remember after that
D	no
A	right shall we er
B	but yeah
A	head off
C	yeah nice and warm here though
B	you could just nod off
A	we've just been in the rain all day in car parks
C	yeah
B	in and out of cars and
B	yeah
C	I'm just really hungry
B	did you did what did what have
A	er a nearly new 308 Peugeot
B	oh right is that one with a
A	yeah I think so
B	for the dogs?
A	yeah yeah
B	right okay oh right okay cos they were after a Qashqai weren't they but have they changed their mind about that?
A	yeah I think they've gone lower and longer
D	a what? a what?
B	a
A	four-by-four
D	a Nissan?
B	yes yeah cos Nissan and Honda are the two most reliable
D	yeah
B	makes that's the
D	yeah
B	the the thing but
D	no
B	but they were
D	but it's still a four-by-four
B	no no no no this is
D	oh
B	like an I would call it an estate car so that that's my perception of what what you'd call it
D	oh right
B	did did what they doing with
A	erm thought about it but again it's a bit more expensive to run cos it's a bigger engine
B	is it what
A	it's a one point four
B	oh right okay
A	so it's costs more to tax and
B	mm
A	erm
D	what make is that that he's got?
B	Peugeot
A	that's a Peugeot 307
D	oh he's got a Peugeot yeah mm
B	so a 308's a bit bigger than what they had did they say?
D	mm
B	it's a bit bigger?
A	yeah a 308 or a 3008 I dunno the the numbering isn't very logical at Peugeot but yeah it is bigger
B	it is bigger cos they do a lot of travelling up the
D	I was going to say yeah they'd probably take that into account if er I mean they were buying it or something
B	they do a lot of
D	and you've got to go a long way
A	yeah
D	do a lot of distance eh
A	yeah
B	and have they done lots of research or?
A	yeah I think so they've been to test drive a few different ones
B	yeah
A	over the past couple of weeks
B	mm
D	mm cos it's a big decision really isn't it? you know
B	well it's a massive investment isn't it? it's the next
A	mm
B	investment down from
D	well you hope you've not done the wrong thing that's it isn't isn't it you?
A	yeah
B	thing is if you buy from a a garage
D	yeah
C	they they're usually between three and six months
B	mm
C	and a lot of them will make sure you've got a new MOT on it as well
B	so it I think that's kinda quite important isn't it?
D	yeah
B	plus I know I've mentioned before cos you kinda get the AA or the RAC to do like a a check on a car for you you can actually pay them to do it and that I think if you're investing such a lot of money it might be worth paying for that service if you and just just to check it out I don't know cos these days it's
A	yeah
B	whether the mileage has been clocked and such like so
A	you get these er they're called a HPI check now
B	oh yes so that they're not hire purchase so that they're not?
A	no it's the check on
D	that's
B	oh
A	on all this company collects all data from all different places to check for things like has it been in an accident? has it been
D	mm
B	ah
A	er has the mileage been clocked? and all that kinda stuff and just
B	but it's also because it's really important that there's no finance outstanding on the car
A	yeah all that stuff yeah
B	that's really important cos
B	otherwise they can come and repossess it from you even though
B	that that that's a horrible thing to to and and
D	yeah
B	I would
A	yeah
B	imagine that most cars are actually bought on finance if you think about it
B	although if somebody takes out a personal loan from a bank
B	and spends it on a car that's a different thing but if it
D	yeah
B	if you've taken finance
A	yeah
B	out for a specific vehicle then
A	where the car's
D	and I mean all these thieves and everything they
B	yeah
D	everything's gone so erm I dunno how can I say? don't know what you can call it but
B	corrupt?
D	well yeah and also clever you know they they find ways of getting round all the things don't they?
A	yeah
D	whether it's your phone or what the hell it is you know
B	well they could well they could be so dangerous couldn't they? you know if somebody's
D	mm
B	done something to make a car okay when it's not okay then it's
D	but do you remember us we used to go to
B	you did yeah
D	yeah we used always get the Rovers from
B	yeah
D	from them
B	yeah
D	and I remember the chap that we when we
B	steeling wheels
D	and are more how can I say? not so not so maybe not so corrupt I don't know but like everything changes
B	well you remember things er don't you? I mean I remember having the spare wheels stolen out of my erm
D	did you?
B	mm well it was a Peugeot actually when I think about it and it was it was actually when I was doing Tupperware and it was Tupperware
A	yeah I remember that it was in a cage on the bottom of the car
B	yeah absolutely
D	when you what?
B	somebody
A	and another time someone put a machete through your roof thing
B	that was the worst one that was a Fiat Punto
D	mm
B	and I was working in a certain area I better not say where it was and erm yeah there was somebody came with a a machete and it put it through the roof through the bonnet and smashed the back window
D	really?
B	mm you remember?
D	no I don't
B	cos I had to scoop all this glass I cut my hand scooping glass off to drive home with the wind whistling through the car because there was it it had had the window smashed and and they had to put a whole new think it was only cos it was a new car that that it was worth repairing otherwise cos they they'd missed the engine I think cos the engine would start when he'd gone through the bonnet
C	why did they do that?
B	well complete nutcase because somebody had witnessed it from across the road and hadn't gone out I don't blame them why would you? why would you
D	but did they report it?
B	erm I don't know if they did I think they they admitted seeing it later on or I don't know who called the police but police came and there was kind of
D	yeah
B	I was absolutely horrified you can imagine can't you?
D	yeah yeah
B	and they were
A	oh yeah
B	okay mm
D	so you wouldn't have to pay Tupperware would pay would they?
B	well they would
D	did you?
B	you know yeah because it it was part of the thing if you had a claim that you had to pay the excess
D	yeah yeah
B	so it was something like seventy-five pounds at the time but
C	mm
B	I mean that's gone up
A	wow
B	considerably
D	sure it has remember you know where
B	mm
D	remember we used to park behind the old shops there along well not the old shops school road?
B	I've now got very hazy memories of that cos I can't
D	don't think we paid anything cos we'd shop and then cut through
B	mm?
D	between the street between the shops
B	mm mm?
D	to this car park
B	it had
D	had just gone you know? I of course I never ever found out what happened but
C	suppose they were easier to steal then weren't they?
D	they were
A	happened to one of dad's car yeah
B	yeah
A	we we went to the library in
B	yeah that was that was Volvo wasn't it? that was
A	C30 or something
B	yes
D	that was a nice car that wasn't it?
B	it was a it was a nice car mm
C	they were easier to get into weren't they?
C	and start hot-wire
B	yeah
C	but they're not as
B	you can't do that now I don't think they just mug you for the key or break into your house for the key
A	mm
B	this is my new I got my new phone going fine did I tell you?
A	you did yeah I think you showed us
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	did I?
A	what did you tell us? I can't remember now
B	I must've told you because I don't know if I had it when I last saw you
A	well I meant to bring
C	ah
A	I'll bring it next time
B	next time okay but it's going but I had to go into the Carphone Warehouse to
A	is this T-Mobile getting it wrong?
B	wasn't T-Mobile no it's Vodafone
A	oh
B	and I was transferring to Vodafone from Vodafone so there wasn't actually doing
A	mm
B	I was getting emails from them saying thank you for staying with Vodafone and I thought I only stayed with Vodafone after having rung them to say thinking of leaving I'm going to the Carphone Warehouse and actually the contract is with Vodafone can you not do can you not match your own contract? oh no
A	mm
B	would you like to?
B	because when I went into the Carphone Warehouse he said oh where did you get that? said oh
B	so erm cos
B	Apple don't make this colour anymore so would you like to look at it?
A	mm mm
B	oh here you go
A	it's very nice
C	blingy
B	erm so
A	really?
B	to a tiny SIM card
A	mm
B	and we went through all these little different
A	mm
D	well it doesn't
B	no
D	mean much to me apart from the colour
B	it's
D	pink gold oh
B	but I got the case erm and a in-charger an in-car sorry charger and a screen protector
B	we'll go up to twenty-one pounds
A	what?
B	so for me to keep
C	oh
B	so I went to Carphone Warehouse I got a new phone
C	yeah
B	crazy is it not?
C	yeah it is
A	that's good how long's that for?
B	two years and I'm quite happy with not having the
D	oh
B	and I'm quite happy to have the several models ago cos I really don't care erm
A	how are you getting on with it then? compared to your Samsung?
B	actually okay I'm still getting used to it but then because I hadn't really used one before but I quite like it cos I wanted it to pair up with my computer and I wanted to be able to take a photograph and for it go up to Ipad this is just me thinking
A	mm
B	and
A	have you got it all set up then?
B	erm more or less I think but
A	oh right
C	that's good
B	but the hardest thing poor man was thumb print because I was trying to do
B	his patience was tested severely
A	mum you couldn't press your thumb on the screen?
B	he was very he was very patient I thought this is actually quite a test he's he was laughing and he
B	and then I had to
A	oh god
B	to
A	on my phone I have
A	well
B	oh right well I could've had
A	see that thing?
B	oh
A	yeah you have to move your finger round it
B	yeah
B	yeah but I wasn't doing it with in the right place or with the right amount of pressure
B	yeah good lord did that take ages?
B	so eventually now
A	wow
B	once that was set up it was fine so yeah I've been doing
C	the thumb print's for security they can use your own thumb print so the phone knows who's using it so someone else can't do it
C	it has to be
C	isn't it clever?
A	like Mission Mission Impossible
D	sounds clever I don't understand but
B	it is clever but once once it's been set up by by the goons or whatever by this guy
B	well that's the thing because it's it was easier I thought that was an easier one to do
A	oh yeah
B	so it's
A	they're supposed to be easier to use
B	it is
A	cos you can't really change the way that they work cos Android phone and Samsung do their own version Google do a version all
B	right?
A	Apple iOS you can't really customize it other than like changing your background or whatever
B	yes well all I
A	supposed to be simpler
B	it is simple I think for a simple person but
B	it's it's I've changed my
B	so I said what do I do if I want to just put a a so I've got to apparently download a song that I want and then I can do it but I think that's another project for another day it's a little bit too painful too involved
C	yeah take your time
A	just sing it into the recorder if you want
B	imagine that ringing out like
B	waving away
C	you could do that though you could put your
B	oh
C	that way the I won't be
A	it'd be bloody awful quality
C	it would be alright wouldn't it?
C	and just record it and you could use the recording for your ringtone
B	mm
C	and you don't have to download it
D	so what song were you going to choose?
B	it was Coldplay it's my
B	it's
C	is it that one?
B	yes
A	yeah
A	got a recording we've got a recording there
B	oh dear so I thought yeah cos I just kinda thought yeah I'll have a proper song I won't just have the
B	seashore
A	Apple song isn't it?
B	well there's several
A	oh the
B	there's a whole list I've
B	I think I'll have my own so yeah
A	right shall we make tracks then?
C	alright
A	need to er sort our stuff out
C	yeah
D	so are you out again tomorrow doing? same thing as you did today similar?
A	er we'll be at be at work
C	put I put these in your kitchen you can have them as a treat tomorrow
D	oh thank you
C	you're welcome
B	oh
C	we've got some more crisps at home we can't be eating them all
D	oh right
C	I've put them on I've put them next to your microwave
D	right don't forget that bottle of lemonade
C	oh yeah
D	it's left from Christmas isn't it? sitting there
A	mm do you want it mum?
B	the the lemonade?
D	mm
C	we can save it for Christmas
C	have some snowballs
A	we've already got a bottle
C	the due look the the date's already gone it was June last year
B	really?
C	yeah
B	I just tipped some stuff away actually at home because I looked at it and I thought do you know what?
A	let's just tip it away
B	it's it's it was way out of date and I just thought just throw it
D	I know never even looked and I
D	I assume that a lot of those things are
B	are there any of these left?
A	help yourself have you finished with this
D	yes yes thank you very much
D	don't worry about them I'll do the dishes
A	are you sure?
D	yes positive
A	I'll put them in the kitchen
D	how did you go on with the erm
B	mm yes
D	did you manage to keep dry?
B	yeah
D	ah
B	mm we went to the Manchester the art gallery on erm Moseley Street yesterday
A	did you?
B	mm
D	never been in have I been there?
A	City Gallery?
D	I think might've been once donkey's years ago though
B	well I just don't think I'll
D	mm
A	I went for the first time
D	remember
A	with
B	no
D	no
B	well
D	I think I heard something on the radio about erm not all that long ago about that gallery and that erm
B	mm
D	they were discussing that you know?
B	we did have we did have enough for something to eat though I just had some soup
D	yeah
B	and
D	oh
B	mm
D	it's quite sensible that isn't it for
B	mm
D	that sort of place? you know you can
B	mm
D	might just want just something to put you on
B	mm
D	depends how much you you're bothered about the art I suppose
B	well
D	really
B	yeah no it was er
D	was it mostly art?
B	mm
D	yeah?
B	yeah yeah
B	else
D	no
D	erm
B	yeah
D	good
B	it's a change and something different to do
D	yeah
A	yeah it's for a bit of a change
B	mm
D	and then there's the one at erm opposite the in
D	that's supposed to be very good isn't it?
A	yeah we went there
A	we went there a few weeks ago they were playing this er
A	this animated film erm
D	oh
A	with a someone was playing the piano and playing a cello
D	oh
A	it was called the
D	mm
D	updating them with things and
B	how do you get to hear about things though? because
A	er I get this email called Manchester Wire and it tells you all sorts of stuff
B	Manchester Wire? it's not Manchester is there a Manchester Life one as well?
A	there's probably loads of stuff like that
B	mm
A	there's a lot of stuff at
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
D	there's a lot of adverts for all these things it's
A	community stuff
B	yeah
A	food markets
D	sometimes
A	er you know
B	mm
D	yeah
A	everything like stuff that's going on in
D	well they're always talking about Manchester aren't well aren't they?
A	about ale festivals
D	you know quite a lot mm
B	is there a market in
A	I'm not sure actually there is one in
B	but it that's easy enough for you to get there
D	the one that they always think is one of the best is the the
A	oh yeah
C	oh yeah I've heard all about
D	it's it's nice it's good
B	mm
C	yeah this er one of the regulars at my old work he used to always
D	yeah
C	come in after being at
D	all the lots of old-fashioned things that you can't get
C	yeah he'd always bring
D	like
C	different flavoured curds
D	yeah
C	like
D	things that
C	he bought me a bought me a jar of pineapple curd once
B	mm
C	it was a bit weird
D	all sorts of things as well for blokes you know the
D	blokes that mend things and
C	yeah
D	you know all that that you wouldn't see
C	traditional stuff
D	they'd all be in in a shop they'd be in a bubble pack and they'd be
B	must've been was it two years ago that we went to
C	do they do like great pies or something? someone was telling me that
B	mm
D	oh yeah yes and all of that
C	and amazing cheeses and stuff
B	mm
D	yeah
B	we can go there on the Met as well
C	yeah
D	oh that's yeah that's that's
B	because we were just saying yesterday we went into Manchester we went to the Manchester Art Gallery on Moseley Street
C	oh did you?
B	just had a look around and just had a little
D	well there's lots of things in the city that
B	but
D	yeah
B	erm years ago haven't been there and
C	okay
B	look up what's
C	good website that
B	mm
C	what's going on
D	mm
B	well I keep saying to him how do you know all these things? because
D	cos some of them are only perhaps a one-off you know?
C	mm mm
B	gotta be gotta be quick
D	mm
C	catch them while you can
B	well
C	oh was it in the
B	mm
C	with all the pots and
B	it was all black
C	and
B	it was all black black black black black
C	oh right
B	it was all yes all all
C	was it on the ground floor?
B	mm yeah
C	oh have to go and have a look at that
B	I don't know if that's coming to an end I think that was coming to an end but
C	oh have to go this week
B	mm
A	mm
B	oh sorry
C	this is one of my first ring designs
A	Yorkshire?
B	oh let's have a look oh
D	is it a new one?
C	oh it looks like slices of erm fruit orange
B	oh right oh
C	it's all Perspex
B	wow
D	let's have a look
C	I've started my collection
B	so are you are you doing this as a project or are you doing it to sell or?
C	think so
B	mm
C	I'm not sure what I'm doing
C	this is another one
B	oh wow
C	they're just rough
B	yeah
C	rough erm quite crude er ones but
B	well actually that's good cos you know what? as well as the design though it would just you can coordinate something with your outfit can't you?
C	mm yeah
B	somebody could say I have got this orange outfit and I want a ring to go with it
C	mm yeah it's
B	mm
C	I'm just working scrap
B	mm
C	acrylic at the moment I don't wanna
D	mm
C	this is one of them they're a bit futuristic I suppose they're made out of plastics
D	right
C	but er
D	these are your designs?
C	yeah did them last week
D	oh aren't you clever?
C	and that's another one they're done using
D	yeah to
C	to to
C	erm
C	cos I've cos I've got a new heat gun so they're quite sculptural I don't know where it's gonna go I don't know whether they're pieces they're not I suppose I
D	you don't want to be a?
C	I I I just wanna make stuff that I think's interesting
B	mm and different
C	at this stage
D	well lots of
C	I don't wanna
B	your creativity
C	I do need to make some money
A	that's a point of residency isn't? you're supposed to exhibit as one of the like the college's products
B	yeah
A	what you're doing
C	they don't wanna see stuff that could sell in Top Shop
B	oh no
D	no no no
A	bit more bit more innovative
C	yeah
B	no well it's about erm your individual creativity
C	yeah
B	your individual design and
C	I've enjoyed it so far anyway
B	oh we should be out of here
C	I'm just every day I'm just like what am I doing? should I just get a normal job? but I don't think I'd be happy with a normal job
B	just
B	take the opportunity that you've got
C	yeah
B	and and just go with it and do
C	don't think about it
B	no
C	just do it
B	the chance
A	mm
B	cos if you went and said oh no I won't do that anymore I'll go and work full-time wherever then you've lost that
C	yeah
B	so while you get the opportunity and just
D	mm
C	yeah
B	people that
C	I think after this residency I might I think I'm gonna I would like to go and intern for someone again
B	mm
C	but maybe someone at a different in a different area of design to
B	mm
C	not quite such a more art jewellery you know stuff that
B	mm
C	work with those materials
C	cos I don't really know anything about metals or that kind of thing I just know plastic right now
D	mm
C	yeah
D	not like half a dozen on a stand in a shop sort of thing
A	mm
C	yeah some people only want to wear stuff like that don't they?
B	mm
B	mm
C	there is a market for it
B	mm
D	yeah yeah I think so
C	cos if you make stuff that's too sellable then you end up being so bogged down with production of the same stuff
B	mm
D	yeah yeah
C	then I'd probably I'd be I'd feel like Amy Winehouse
B	no
C	you know being forced to just
D	yeah
C	make all this stuff over and over again where I'm not learning anything
B	or
B	you could if you found something commercial
C	yeah
B	other half creative
C	yeah
B	or whatever or whatever
C	other half work at the restaurant
B	well
A	yeah
C	can we change maths please so that I can have three halves?
A	mm
