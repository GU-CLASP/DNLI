B	oh right
A	got home and I made the mistake of getting into bed
B	yeah
A	and then didn't move for the entire evening
B	I don't mind it
A	the girl I used to live with was absolutely obsessed with it
B	no it's good
A	so are you looking forward to the Avengers? That's not superman I know but it's all the rest isn't it?
B	it's not superman no
A	yeah
B	and then they thought oh we can make some more money and then put the all in the same film
A	yeah
B	it's a
A	and that's why they're doing
B	but it's like they've got Iron Man that Thor
A	I know it's good isn't it? They didn't get new actors you mean?
B	yeah
A	well I suppose it's continuity in a way isn't it?
B	it is yeah

C	yeah
A	oh thank you
C	it's alright no
A	oh thank you

A	when you're busy it goes quickly doesn't it? And you've
C	yeah yeah
A	oh no

A	yeah
C	em
A	ten mile hike
C	well not ten but
A	but even still
C	yeah so I didn't bother
A	oh
C	so I'm really annoyed now cos I the last thing I want to do is do a Reiki in the rain
A	no no no no
C	well trouble is I won't know whether I'm taking or not until tomorrow morning cos I don't know whether it's going to rain
A	well this I mean and it's not a problem to me
C	yeah it's just  it's just  a nuisance really?
A	it is a real annoyance
C	it was cold
A	yeah
C	erm I I mean a cold wind is bad enough if you're feeling fit
A	yeah
C	but the problem is you see I
A	oh really?
C	not only has he got bad ankles
A	yeah
C	but he's also got the first stages of diabetes
A	oh has he? Oh gosh
C	well it happens to a lot of people when they get older
A	is that?
C	and he was struggling a bit you know
A	yeah
C	eh cos if you don't you keel over
A	okay
C	which means that I've really got to know
A	know where you're going
C	Cos a lot of you know
A	and is that next Monday is it?
C	yeah so I've got  I've got  my own one on Saturday that I'm leading
A	oh blimey
C	the one I've  The one I've  erm been
A	planning for a while
C	planning for for quite a while
A	really? Because I was going to
C	well you can  you can  but there's not there's no facilities anywhere
A	right
C	it's not open during the day
A	oh okay
C	so that might be a better one
A	yeah
C	so it might be better to wait until April actually
A	right
C	so
A	ah nice
C	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	I'll eh I'll do more  I'll do more  Yeah
A	although this week has been cold
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and it's slightly annoying cos I like my walks to be good
A	is the route nice though?
C	no
C	well it's it's not actually
A	oh yeah
C	Lord
A	hasn't he got thirty-two thousand acres or something?
C	I've I've obviously chosen a few acres that are not too interesting
A	well especially if there are no facilities at all you kind of want to have a shorter walk don't you
C	no
A	yeah it would make sense to
C	erm
A	no
C	it's just a nuisance that's all
A	yum
C	I'll put this light on so we can see what we're doing
A	can I have that water please
C	how's work
A	it's good yeah
C	yeah
A	so Friday is her last day
C	mm
A	so I've already taken over a couple of her projects
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yes
A	mm
C	I've got another eh update from uncle
A	oh yeah
C	no I think it was
A	oh okay
C	I said to him I'd have a look and I haven't got round to it yet
A	mm
C	I'm gonna  I'm gonna  print I can't remember how many pages? Is it seventy pages someone said?
A	yeah it's long
C	mm
A	I can do it at work and bring you round a copy
C	yeah I was thinking of
B	no good
C	no? Have you read it?
B	no I didn't mean it's no good
A	I was gonna say that's quite harsh
B	yeah I didn't mean that
A	no good
B	I'm sure it's very good but I'm just saying that I know nothing about things like that
C	Don't forget it's written from the point of view of somebody that makes films
B	yeah but I think most films are rubbish
A	ah
C	mm
A	yeah I'm definitely going to have to get round to that
B	I just meant my my opinion's not worth anything
C	why not?
B	Cos I don't read
C	but that's not
B	yeah but stories that appeal to a lot of other people don't appeal to me so it's not
C	mm
B	you still got echoes on it?
A	yeah it's rubbish
B	get a new one
A	yeah
B	let me keep that one
A	you have to give it back sadly
B	damn
C	it's got echoes nobody will be able to hear what
A	and you can't hear me?
C	well when
A	oh yeah you just yeah that was a bit of a
C	I could just hear the echo
A	really?
C	but unless he was repeating exactly the same the words that I was using it was actually my voice
A	how funny
C	well I'm I'm getting so bad at at recognising people's voices that the other day when I phoned
A	okay
C	so I'm terrible at the moment
A	I'm tired with the phone
C	right our voice never sounds the way we think it sounds
A	most people said that
B	that's why it's best not to record yourself
A	well no one's going to hear it really
B	no but I I wouldn't want to listen to myself back
A	I find it hilarious
C	yes
A	all about his new story
C	oh right
A	but it's all a bit hush hush so I had to delete it
C	yeah under wraps yeah
A	mm
B	yeah but what's going to happen
A	well yeah no
C	mm
A	oh yum yum yum
C	the shop
A	the
C	yeah
A	well you could always give them a ring and see if you can pop by one one day
C	that's what I don't  That's what I don't  like doing it
A	you don't want to do it over the phone either
C	I don't trust it
A	mm
C	I don't trust machines with my details and I certainly don't people with it
A	right good
B	you're more likely to have someone steal your details in person
A	mm yeah
B	than over the phone or the internet
A	no you're not are you?
C	well you're more likely to have someone steal your details over the phone rather than
B	you are
C	how can they do that?
A	how is that possible if you went it to a bank?
B	happened to Mum
C	oh yeah I see what you mean yeah
B	people will take them in shops in restaurants
A	yeah but that's why you can't let your card out of your sight
C	you should never let it out of your sight yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	yes you must never let it out of your sight
B	Cos the internet is is pretty safe if you use the right sites
A	you just have  you just have  to be a bit savvy
B	mm
C	yeah I think it's the that that's the point
A	it's being secure whatever you're doing
B	and if if you buy stuff from Amazon even though I don't like doing it I'm sure it's probably one of the safest sites that you can use
A	oh it absolutely is yeah
C	because em all their
A	billions of people use it every day
C	all all the security they have
A	yeah
C	Amazon would go out of business
A	absolutely
C	yeah
B	what they pay you to do it?
A	yeah
B	nice
A	I'll bring you round some biscuits
B	nice
A	yeah
C	I know it's it's awful isn't it?
A	yeah
C	there's erm there's something on the internet I can't think of the name now which gives you your credit sort of history and credit rating
A	yeah it's your credit money
C	is it
A	experian
C	experian
A	that's who I went with
C	oh right
A	so you can you don't have to set up and account with them you can just request it for two pounds which is what I did but then you're not given any sort of support
C	more
A	exactly
C	or if it's not necessary how eager you are to find out about your credit history cos
A	they say that you should do it every year don't they?
C	well
A	but it was more because before I went travelling I applied for a credit card and was declined
C	alright good
A	no
C	oh right
A	they had to order in the forks
C	and they're waiting for them to come in are they?
A	yeah so I've still got the courtesy bike which is a nightmare not having any gears
C	no
A	oh my god
C	well because it's going on that all the time you know because if you suddenly oh I've had enough of this and and suddenly you know your your leg will come up when you're not expecting it to
A	sounds very dangerous very strange idea
C	I mean they've had them for years I mean when bikes were first invented that's all they were
A	yeah
C	which means that em eh once you stop peddling the wheel keeps going round back wheel keeps going round but the cog stays still because the ball bearings in the centre are spinning round okay?
A	right
C	and then when you pedal again em it picks up the momentum
A	like my bike
C	like yours yeah but narrower than yours
A	but narrower yeah
C	well that's the other thing you don't need a back break
A	okay yeah
C	you only need one break
A	yeah
C	because you you can control the back wheel by peddling slower
A	no
C	straight away I mean you can eventually obviously because you can come to a stand still
A	but you have to slow yourself
C	but when the bike moves the peddles move
A	mm
C	em so
A	okay
C	but it is
A	mm
C	you can get yourself into a  You can get yourself into a  lot of trouble if you're not careful
A	yeah it would throw you off
C	yeah
A	I don't know why
C	I mean in in you know I mean being thrown off along a country lane is one thing
A	get run over
C	but you know being thrown off in the city of London is probably certain death I should think
A	absolutely
C	there's cars everywhere
A	I couldn't imagine anything more scary
C	oh it is cos there are very few lanes and cars are not used to seeing cyclists and they just ignore them really
A	never look no
C	and it's always not always but the majority of I mean the I can't remember now how many people get killed in London every year who are riding bikes but it's a huge amount
A	it's a lot actually
C	and invariably it's because eh the driver of the usually lorry eh hasn't seen the cyclist cos you know the cyclist is too close or too near or he's one the wrong side
A	they never check their wing mirrors
C	well if they do they erm you know the wing mirrors only show the the eh erm view erm eh that's that's behind them well a lot of that view if you look in the mirror is going to be the lorry itself
A	yeah absolutely
C	erm erm but it's things like roundabouts where eh lorries can't see you
A	scary isn't it? I mean cyclist don't necessarily help themselves you know with the the cyclist who died recently was squashed by a lorry because they were turning left at traffic lights
C	or if you're a cyclist you have to assume that the lorry is not going to therefore stay behind it don't don't get up the side of it
A	exactly
C	no absolutely
A	they'll indicate when they can move
C	or not at all
C	yeah
C	erm
A	couple of minutes yeah
C	so if you're  if you're  going along the side and suddenly they turn green and a lorry moves
C	yeah
C	so it's always better to hold back
A	yeah
C	unless unless you can  unless you can  see you know that the lights have just changed
A	just literally yeah
C	you know literally changed to red so you can get down there before and get in front of the lorry
A	you just
C	no no
A	it's too dangerous
C	it's far too dangerous no
A	mm
C	and and drivers are in a hurry
A	and there's just so much traffic
C	yeah
A	and taxi drivers
C	so again with bus drivers the thing to do because they rely on it for their living is you know make them forfeit their licence
A	absolutely
C	Cos then they wouldn't wouldn't be able to drive
A	no way
C	then the
A	yeah
C	they don't have the same erm understanding about cyclists
A	yeah
C	so yeah so it is
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
C	so not worth it
A	well no you sit on that chair dad
C	no no I'm going to sit on eh this chair cos eh otherwise if I sit in front of the television I tend to doze off so
A	right then shall we watch some Lost?
C	yeah
A	unless you're really keen on watching erm Smelly Oaks
C	I'm going to get myself and apple
A	oh an apple would be nice thanks dad
B	no
A	really? Think of your insides
B	no
A	your poor little insides
B	no
A	we went to see Laura Marling
B	yeah
A	I was so tired by the end
B	no not in a while?
A	mm
B	mm
A	what about
B	yeah it's closed
A	has it actually closed?
B	you been you live on that road
B	no not
B	yeah that's that one
A	yeah
B	no I don't ever go to the
B	yeah they redid it and then closed it straight away
A	and closed it down
B	what are we on twenty-one?
A	are we
C	twenty-one
A	nearly finished
B	no we watched that one
A	the Greater Good yeah we did watch that one
B	yeah I think so
A	who's your favourite character dad?
C	erm I like Hurley
A	hurley yeah
B	Jacob is by far the best character
C	yeah but he's not in it very much
A	yeah but he he doesn't come in till the end
B	yeah
