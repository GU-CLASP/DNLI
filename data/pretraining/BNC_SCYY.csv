A	you killed the Jesus plant
B	I can't believe it's come back to life
A	it's quite kind of just like
B	it's so good like I never thought that it would
A	yeah but you so you said that she like the main one was brown but she picked off the shoots
B	yeah
A	mm
B	dry yeah
A	that that's all um that that's the only
B	but it's but some plants though once they go past that point of no return
A	yeah yeah definitely I mean you you have that one with the
B	like I think the chillis one
A	what was it?
B	which one?
A	yeah the one
B	ah the peace lily
A	that we overwatered
B	um
A	well
A	ah
B	maybe
A	hm
B	like a
A	ah
B	maybe it'll come back to life
A	um
B	yeah
A	as for like you know a lot of the hot ones like oranges that you would need to grow in a greenhouse or something uh
B	yeah
A	there's
B	but I fancy getting one of those like you know have you seen those kind of removable one? Like greenhouses I mean like they're sort of it's like a shelf it's like a shelving unit but it's got like plastic over
A	uh yeah
B	can get them from B and Q
A	oh right
B	they're only about twenty quid I think
A	how how high is it?
B	um I think about as high as you are
A	oh right
B	so
A	where do we put it?
B	in the back
A	the back garden?
B	dunno
A	ah it's a north facing  north facing  garden
B	I know it is
A	um
B	ah d'you know what me leggings like
B	what's your
A	I
B	well no
A	but uh
B	well they all kinda look a bit eighties I suppose but
A	but I think we used to wear stuff like that you know in Shakespearean sort times?
B	well yes the legging I suppose doesn't have its routes directly in the eighties although the advent of Lycra might've
A	Cos you see like you know like like
B	yeah what were they called again then? Like uh knickerbockers and that
A	men in tights sort of thing
B	or Robin Hood Men
A	you know like
B	yeah yeah
A	basically they were knitted like
B	I've never even seen
A	they knitted them uh they knitted them sorts of
B	well yeah
A	uh well I mean they're called
B	well woolly tights still are the best like
A	think I was
B	my best pair of woolly tights were the ones that I had on like them grey ones
A	so that uh bike thing uh
B	never mind
A	yeah there was
B	stupid thing?
A	silly silly accident wasn't it?
B	well I yo know like the bike man when I told him about it like you know he he screwed my lamp on like so it's fixed like it doesn't move a centimetre
A	yeah?
B	and I I never turn it off either
A	yeah yeah
B	I never turn it off
A	no? Oh I I suppose you don't need to do you if it's a dynamo
B	well
A	yeah
B	so
A	alright
B	but yeah I'm not a big fan of the
A	well like I weren't those ones that you were talking about then uh worn in conjunction with something else?
B	they were
A	not not long ago um people used to wear like uh one piece uh leggings and dress combo
B	I was  I was  gonna say d'you ever remember those? Maybe you don't
A	and and a dress looked like uh uh
B	did you ever have you ever see those? They were really weird
A	ah
B	oh
A	maybe like five or six or seven years ago
B	which ones?
A	yeah it was a one piece leggings and dress combo
B	no I don't
A	yeah
B	like a you mean like a cat suit?
A	or a long top
B	that's what that that girl had on like a long top and leggings
A	no
B	oh right
A	or a big floral pattern
B	underneath?
A	and they'd be like part of the same thing
B	were they attached though or did you just seem them in conjunction with each other? Did you ever explore the attachment issues?
A	like did we use to? No I think they were I mean
A	people just
B	maybe they weren't man
A	uh I could explore the attachment issues like how could I have done that? Uh
A	well I um
B	yeah but that doesn't mean they were attached
A	where I used to work in
B	like
A	no but people used to like the sort of seemed like they went together anyway I mean even if they weren't attached so that you you could only wear the two parts with each you couldn't wear them with
B	okay
A	you don't  you don't  remember those things then?
B	not not
A	yeah I think maybe actually uh
B	yeah
A	although
B	I don't think they were attached you know
A	I'm not  I'm not  sure about her like like
B	I've never been a
A	but they they didn't last long
B	I've never been a fan of  a fan of  the legging really
A	wasn't that eighties?
B	well you know
A	early nineties
B	well I was you know I was only seven in the end of the eighties so
A	yeah
B	nineties really early nineties
A	so you didn't like the visor?
B	but me
A	you do like visors?
B	you've seen like that
B	well it's just the styles isn't it? We'll probably look back at pictures our of ourselves now and be like oh my god why did I think X Y and Z looked nice? Like
B	Cos I look back  I look back  at now and my pictures of my dad
A	oh yeah
B	yeah you do
A	um
B	forever
A	yeah
B	but it'll be  it'll be  your hair and your beard cos that's what changes when you're a man isn't it like?
A	it should should there's no reason why you shouldn't just keep to the
B	but you actually you're right like though
A	but mind you having having said that I do wear denim trousers not um
B	denim trousers that sounds like not jeans
A	denim based trousers
B	I do wear denim denim trousers
A	well
B	yes you can
A	can you?
B	you could have like chinos made out of denim like a
A	those would be jeans though wouldn't they?
B	like a
A	why are they called jeans anyway? Is it to do with some French guy?
B	um
A	un no surely any trouser made of denim is a  is a  jean
B	I don't think that's the case
A	uh no I I wouldn't think of
B	yeah but when you think of jeans
A	I wasn't that wasn't  that wasn't  my point
B	like if you see granddads in jeans they're definitely more of a denim trouser than a jean aren't they?
A	if you were to genuinely have like
B	if you see like a grandda in like a grandda jean that's definitely more a denim trouser than a jean
A	I haven't seen a grandda in denim
B	I don't really imagine they were
A	what is a chino?
B	well is is it not like a brand of cotton slack? Oh actually I think it's a cut
A	sounds um specific
B	um
A	no I just mean like
B	I bet your cousins like a chino
A	does your your um? No no no it's not chino I mean you're using like a silly word to refer to like like
B	or a corduroy
A	used to be like
B	like a dress trouser?
A	until until we all went mental about jeans like
B	like a dress trouser yeah
A	but then actually over history obviously trousers have changed and actually used to have those we were talking about the legging type ones you know the like Robin Hood Men In Tights sort of type ones that the uh Shakespearean
B	yeah
A	them sort of Shakespearean tight trousers they used to wear I mean
B	yeah
A	and them ones with like the long johns and like uh big socks
B	like a drop watch?
A	you know like Georgian like
B	and then you've got like the um the MC Hammer
A	I think that's that's cool
B	I was playing  I was playing  you know Draw Me you know the the app the game Draw Me?
A	yeah
B	I was playing Draw Me the other day and I got MC Hammer
A	well no you can't write words that's cheating
B	yeah you can a bit
A	I don't think you can write words um
B	my cousin Ross is really bad at it
A	fair enough
B	his spelling's really bad
A	well I I I got I just to be honest like I would write like this game is pointless
B	the other day he got um Vikings
A	um and then like bye um something
B	no it is fun
A	uh that wasn't Vikings was it?
B	no wait
A	any hat with a nosepiece?
B	no but if I just drew a hat like that it could be like a bobble hat I I wanted to make it look like it was a warrior or something
A	yeah
B	so he typed in knight
A	well they but their their hats are distinctive so that that
B	wait
A	so so some uh someone's learned something then haven't they?
B	yeah
A	he's learned how to spell
B	spelling was really bad though
A	you've learned how to draw a Viking
B	well I knew how already
A	the game has a point
B	it's just an
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	uh but since they were drawn on top of something else that meant that it wasn't quite the same as as like a computer game
B	yeah
A	so so I was drawing them on the chocolate bar so
B	on the wrapper not on the chocolate bar that sounds wrong
A	yeah no no no
B	anyway sorry I've distracted you from your trouser discussion
A	um
B	yeah like frocks really
A	I don't know if Jesus wore what wore a frock if that's what like
B	well the Romans had like the old toga they like they preferred a a bit of blowing in the breeze
A	I mean in in the hotter countries they would wear sort of think sort of toga thing
B	so like did um you know like a toga so did they wear like undercrackers under their toga?
A	um
B	I bet there's a PhD on that
A	well many uh
B	yeah
A	oh um yeah well I well I mean whether they
B	well
A	did uh like?
B	well the
A	elizabethans?
B	well yeah I mean
A	um
B	well I think they had like
A	right I mean
B	corsetry yeah yeah yeah
A	oh yeah the men  the men  were quite trussed up as well I think weren't they?
B	but also but especially like in the Victorians the whole corsetry really came back again
A	so where where are we? In?
B	so like the
A	the
B	sorry the
A	you've skipped out the sixteen hundreds there the uh the the
B	yeah well probably anything goes then
A	uh no no I don't  I don't  think they had much uh that many fashion innovations in England in that in those days like
B	well how would we know I mean?
B	I think
A	but uh we we were having a civil war and and like our country's a real uh in a bit of a mess at that time
B	but I think it's a sort of the same now isn't it like people who got money always have
A	and that's reflected in their trousers
B	people who've got money always buy themselves nice stuff like
A	the best trousers uh available
B	the best trousers in town yeah
A	I don't know
B	what now?
A	like
B	yeah well now
A	trouser like wealth wealth to trouser type
B	they'd go down  they'd go down  Ede And Ravenscroft wouldn't they and get themselves a like Rupert The Bear
A	yeah in Britain maybe but like
B	probably some Saudi prince is it not?
A	I think Bill Gates wears cotton slacks
B	I was reading a thing about um
A	I mean Sultan of Brunei well he definitely has some funds like
B	I was reading a thing about British industry and um apparently one of the most uh one of the British one of the companies in Britain that turned the biggest profit last year was this company in I think it was Sheffield or Nottingham one of those kind of
A	you mean the biggest export profit?
B	yeah
A	yeah they're French aren't they?
B	the French Airbus planes so those are planes that have got like two two double decker planes you know? It's like a total like giant like super giant plane
A	yeah yeah
B	anyway some Saudi prince has bought an Airbus for himself from the French company who make Airbus
A	yeah?
B	and had it customized so that it includes for example a Turkish bath double you know queen-size bedrooms
A	so if he needs if he wants a Turkish bath like he might
B	A swimming pool conference room
A	if if he if his own Turkish bath was broken then he'd have to get in his plane and fly it just so he could use a Turkish bath?
B	well he could just probably use while it wasn't flying
A	he'd have to fly it like round round the block or something
B	aye
A	come back up like on his uh
B	well I think he could probably use it when he wasn't flying
A	ah well uh I don't think it would be the same uh
B	and it's things like solid marble
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	but anyway this company in
A	like
B	this company in Nottingham or Derby or where Sheffield or something has been doing that
A	well he's got a gold statue of himself hasn't he I mean
B	well I went in
A	that man's achieved a lot but he's he's also made himself look extraordinarily vain and uh greedy
B	oh that hairdo
A	like
B	I went in Trump Towers in New York it's just off Central Park
A	yeah
B	it's literally just marble and
A	the?
B	the
A	the escalator
B	aye
A	well but he's quite scruffy himself isn't he?
B	well
A	maybe just just on the top of his head
B	A what a fly
A	his hair's quite scruffy isn't it?
B	oh it's awful
A	it's like a hair combover
B	that sort of like honey coloured
B	oh it's really bad
A	it's like partly partly yellow and partly white or?
B	Brown yeah like
A	it's like uh a dog weed in the snow
B	aww it's bad it's really bad
A	no uh
B	he was the first no I don't know if it was his idea but yes
A	so so it's like I watched uh his one before the English one started
B	have you watched any of it this time?
A	no
B	yeah yeah it's like week three now or next time
A	really?
B	yeah
A	I've been watching I guess I've been watching the football instead or just not watching
B	well I was out I I was knitting wasn't I last time?
A	yeah and I  and I  was uh working and uh
B	I just thought that like
A	and then before that uh you weren't there and then before that
B	yeah
A	I dunno but
B	I've just got it in me head like you know when we saw that clip when he was like he says bloody and bleeding so many times
B	well I had it in
A	well well all of them have that
B	well no
A	it's a shambles a total bloody shambles
B	and he's like you couldn't even organize
A	no no some of them are  some of them are  good though like
B	but actually the um
A	there are um
B	actually the um
A	the Boleg Boleg Brothers
B	what are they called? The Boleg Brothers like
A	I remember them yeah yeah uh
B	with the Lego animations
A	with the and the they used to get banged on the head with a pan
B	like bong on the frying pan
A	yeah the Lego Boleg Lego stuff yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I um
B	Margaret Mountford?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and uh
B	oh god did you see that thing where
A	I know  I know  that he's  that he's  got uh he's got like uh he's got a gym and he's got uh yeah like a treadmill  a treadmill  and uh and a
B	oh it's bad it's so bad
A	so that's what he  that's what he  watches when he when he's in his on his treadmill
B	oh he's horrible
A	or something and uh
B	I dunno I find him really like oily you know what I mean? Kinda like
A	his hair's an interesting sort of shade of you know biscuit isn't it like?
B	biscuit
A	he's he's biscuit haired like
B	I like that
A	certainly some kind of biscuit
B	I imagine him in me mind's eye
A	yeah
B	did you ever you know like this this is a seasonal reference here like
A	um
B	did you ever do at school where you had to take a boiled egg in and like decorate it? You know like as something like it could be like Santa Claus or like
B	the Easter Bunny or like a person
A	yeah
B	no you must've done that like I did that all through school
B	me dad  me dad  was really good at it
A	sorry I thought school was about like learning and that
B	no it
A	right
B	but anyway um
A	well he he's got quite big ears actually
B	I never really thought about that
A	well yeah um so uh in in his own Michael Portillo obviously and uh uh Alan Johnson was on uh yesterday
B	uh from Lancaster?
A	no he's not from Lancaster
B	he went to uni in Lancaster didn't didn't he? Is he the Health Secretary?
A	I don't think so
B	Alan Milburn I'm thinking of
A	yeah you're
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	uh he's quite old uh but he was like he was pretty like he was quite likable so in fact he he probably would've made a better leader than uh probably the other ones that they've got
B	oh
A	well I guess it's something about his um
B	is this like?
A	Cos people people always want like
B	na na it's not about his face to be honest
A	you know someone who's got the right shape face and the right voice you know
B	I'm not bothered about his face
A	but no you are though people are I mean
B	but he's got that horrible
A	if like if you have if you had the voice that you know if his face looked more like you know Tony Blair or something then people'd be more you know
B	na I think he's got a really unfortunate lisp
A	like imagine Tony Blair's face
B	no I still don't think it would work because if he's got that horrible lisp
A	I mean like you'd be more people'd vote for him wouldn't they?
B	he's got a
A	well him and Ed Balls were went to
B	and the best  the best  thing Labour can do is just be like I'll go down Greggs
A	well they I'm sure they  I'm sure they  did other things than go to Greggs like uh
B	ah well did they? You know it's just
A	well that's isn't it you you're just basing it from the news cos obviously they
B	aye but how else am I supposed to know like
A	they they tried to do things
B	I know what you mean
A	mind you this uh this process with the NHS is probably probably has been going on on a for for ages before I mean like if you're talking about
B	yeah but Labour weren't doing it were they like?
A	well Sunderland away to Man City
B	ah they're gonna get hammered aren't they tomorrow?
A	mind you the they might've thought that uh
B	and who are Birmingham playing?
A	Birmingham is not in the same division so
B	that's oh of course sorry
A	they've
B	totally forgot
A	maybe they'll
B	man City are way
A	no they're second uh it looks like um
B	ah well
A	uh cos cos
B	yeah run in
A	well they certainly struggled against Everton anyway
B	yeah
A	um d'you wanna pause it or?
B	I don't mind
A	yeah
B	then we can get one at the same time maybe
A	um so uh saying that um NHS what were you talking about the NHS?
B	oh no no I was just saying like that I thought it was pathetic that like all the things that are happening Labour are like look I'm buying a pastie like
A	yeah well I mean
B	you know what I was saying about Ed Miliband that I thought he was like really unconvincing and I much preferred his brother really if anything
A	he was more like Tony Blair though
B	yeah but that's not  that's not  why I liked him
A	that that that is a fusion
B	you know I appreciate it is about like um you know promotion isn't it?
A	I mean it it's it's
B	I think like a  like a like a  whole man of the people thing could work like I think that's why like Ed Balls could've could've done better really
A	yeah perhaps he's
B	yeah but he is he's along that he's had a few pasties like
A	I mean Alan Johnson was the  was the  the one that uh that was the most perhaps like ordinary bloke out of all of them
B	yeah
A	well I mean
B	like someone else said like oh okay so he went to Oxford and then he worked as a
A	but some of them are Labour and some are you know Conservative
B	and then he now he's a politician like well wow just you know I'm bowled over by that real-world experience that he's had
A	so so d'you think that
B	least they've done something like
A	but kind of the the job of politicians is is just like
B	yeah
