B	no
C	but do you think he's just because he's
A	yeah
C	so but erm and you're saying he's sixteen in March

C	so then he'll be on the same level as you for the coaching is that what you think?
B	well I think he's done more as well though hasn't he?
C	who
A	well yeah but you two have been a lot more involved than
B	your mum's very involved
C	really involved
A	team there's no I in team
C	there's no I in team
B	there's an E there
C	mm well so you've got the did you send your invoice today?
A	yeah
C	and then in
A	mum thinks I should ask
B	no I think
A	I don't think
C	no no no I
A	no
B	I think you should enquire I think you should
C	cos what did you say it was going up to?
A	well he didn't give me an exact cost but seven
C	seven?
A	yeah something about there
C	well that's okay and
B	or you should say should I put it on this one what or when were you thinking about starting?
C	yeah
B	that's one way of doing it
A	I did three hours today
C	so what who did you teach eleven till twelve?
A	help
C	who's who's his group?
A	well like there's boys and then there's like there's
B	did he say you could coach you could charge for that though?
A	yeah yeah he did
C	how old is she?
A	I dunno she's called
C	right does that matter?
A	well
C	what she's called? yeah
B	I've got you know when I saw you and I thought you looked particularly uninterested?
A	yeah
B	was when you were feeding to
C	oh today did you have to feed to
A	no she looked really uninterested you couldn't even see me I had my back to you
C	anyway go on so
A	I did see you
C	eleven eleven till twelve
A	I was on the side court
B	oh yeah
C	eleven till twelve
A	er yeah I was gonna just give an individual lesson to this
C	right is she new?
A	for an hour
C	right okay
A	but luckily
B	who wanted you to do it?
C	oh did did he have to do it?
C	did he have to do it?
A	I was I was happy to do it and I said that was fine and then
C	oh so who
A	and then he has he had three girls and wanted my help and
C	the
A	and then he did a drill and he was like oh
C	who?
A	yeah so I just stood there hit my two shots in the drill and then
C	so who
A	he had er
B	I bet
C	no
A	no
B	he probably thought I wanted him to do cos you could have done a decent hour's lesson with
A	yeah anyway erm
B	whilst
C	yeah yeah
A	anyway and then
B	and you split that in half and you ended up with three didn't you? you ended up with that lad?
B	and erm
A	no no no in the drill they were swapping courts anyway
B	oh right
C	who who normally helps
A	there's not really a set person it's whoever he'll just ask someone on
C	oh was
A	mm
C	has she started coaching again? yeah?
A	no
C	no?

A	she wasn't down there
B	oh
C	so which coaches were down there just you and
A	usually
C	I was gonna say usually
A	no
C	right
A	and I think usually
C	and was cardio tennis on this morning?
A	but
C	oh
A	cos she used to half of them there used to be quite a lot of girls about her age that she invited and half of them were her mates so it was like a socialising thing for her
C	oh that's weird
A	so she didn't used to charge for it
C	and mm what did I just ask you?
B	I I think
C	yes but he needs a female coach
B	he does need a female coach
C	doesn't he?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah no
C	yes yeah and she's older isn't she? she's like
B	but in terms of coaching ability I don't
C	oh in terms of coaching ability
B	I don't know
C	I think or
B	I don't think
A	she can't go past the age of
B	she wouldn't be able to cope with
A	no
C	there's no girls on a Friday night though is there?
B	to to be honest can
A	he can coach him I guess cos he just gets told by

C	can he can he beat them playing?
A	well no
C	no
A	well me and
C	are they meant to come off? or not?
C	oh they're not?
B	do you concentrate on your technique when you're doing stuff like that?
A	demonstrations?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you?
A	the split step ready position well you've just gotta make it really obvious to everyone
B	mind you
A	yeah but
C	that's a one-on-one isn't it?
B	yeah
C	they're not watching they're just warming up to erm to get ready when are you gonna start cooking the duck?
B	well I'm gonna put that in
C	right
B	when
A	when
B	oh does he?
A	he doesn't always hit like a two-handed backhand but you'll see him split step

B	yeah it would yeah
C	he does have a a
B	the serve will come if you if you continue to
A	yeah but he can hit winners and they're harder than me
B	it doesn't matter
C	you hit a couple of winners
B	you hit winners and the other thing that you do
C	whereas
A	yeah but he's still pretty quick when he wants to be

A	the amount of lads that have gone on like to the age of twenty upwards but just stayed in touch with
C	do you want
B	no they're going in the oven
C	but look oh alright
B	give her one job one blinking job and she can't even follow simple instructions

A	yeah he played full-time tennis
C	oh did he? and why did he give up?
A	he got injured a lot
C	oh what a shame
A	his body couldn't take it and he said he used to have to tell them that his body can't take it
C	yeah
A	he'd just come off like a cripple
C	oh what a shame
A	well he's
C	oh yeah yeah
A	like on that day he wasn't actually meant to play cos he'd just had his ankle
C	oh I remember you saying so he when you say he was the best at fitness in one of the highest tennis academies which one is that?

C	is it it's not in it's not where we it's not in the Midlands where we are?
A	no probably not he er he holds the record one of the most impressive records ever
C	well what how do they test it?
A	like all the bleep tests and everything
C	oh I see
A	around that age
C	he was tall he just barely fitted through the door
C	that's well that's
A	absolutely
C	what would you say he was
A	absolutely huge
C	yeah but
B	well so was
C	do they?
B	oh I hope well depending on what the draw is this year's
B	no I'm hoping you play him in the final is what I'm hoping
A	oh yeah
B	erm
C	and beat him is what we're hoping
B	but it wouldn't surprise me if they they fix it
A	probably against
B	you're playing
A	and in the
C	don't forget the veg will you
C	yeah
A	but no it depends who
C	who are you gonna?
B	I think on a singles court you'd probably rate well you took four games off him last year twenty-four months ago
C	who
A	yeah he he tried to claim that he called me he said he called that I was gonna beat
C	who
A	he tried to claim it he said I was
B	right
A	tried to claim that he called it
C	and erm who are you gonna have as your doubles partner this year?

A	if
C	well
A	this year?
C	wasn't he
B	well he has done a few times
C	he keeps saying that
A	yeah
C	and that so
B	I don't think he I don't think he would
A	but
C	yeah but you lost quite badly last year in the men's doubles didn't you? what was the score?
C	love and one I know but have you improved that much?
A	well last year I couldn't survive on court
C	oh okay
A	this year
C	you've won it
A	I've won it
C	yeah true true
A	but they always said they don't take the winter seriously like
C	is that because at their age their joints don't work well in the winter?
B	no it's because those courts are really difficult
B	the balls are really heavy I mean it's the same for all players so it makes no
C	mm
B	but it's it's not easy I know the courts
A	in the summer it's a lot easier
C	oh is it?
B	the ball doesn't bounce
C	no
B	a court
A	yeah
B	and then the next one it comes up here somewhere
C	what can't he? really?
A	yeah he always talks to me like we're best mates and like
C	belly jumps?
B	belly jumps?
A	yeah

C	has he got a big belly?
B	yeah
A	yeah he's big
C	how can he be so good then at tennis? how does he?

B	no
C	oh
B	well he's better than
C	oh but he's in his forties oh I didn't know that I didn't know that that's
B	but I think erm
A	I'd like to think so he's got quite a big serve though when he wants to
B	well that's your strength isn't it
A	no
B	he'll be difficult to beat
B	yeah
C	he's not playing much at the moment though is he?
A	what for his
C	no because of his new job
B	no he's got a new job
A	yeah well when we
