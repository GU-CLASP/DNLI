A	well thank you for talking to me today
B	that's alright
A	and erm I know you're a model engine here and you're here on a working party today and you giving your time fifteen minutes to talk to me what would you like to talk about today?
B	I don't know
A	you don't know
A	what about your job that the the thing you did before you were erm retired? and erm you're an instrument technician now can you tell me what that entailed?
B	yes anything from pressure gauges to control systems mostly pneumatic but some of it electronic
A	what part of the job did you like the best?
B	all of it
A	really?
B	I enjoyed it all
A	yeah
B	to the point where I actually left twenty-four years almost to the day that I went in and it felt as though I'd literally been there a week
A	oh that's a wonderful experience isn't it?
B	yeah
A	what about the people you worked with?
B	no I'd sooner not talk about them
A	right okay
B	there are some I will talk about there are some I won't
A	yeah? well if you can tell me about some of the characters you work with that would be good
B	what like like the bare knuckle fighter that used to be there
A	really?
B	fought with people like Jack Dempsey who was one of the world champions
A	right
B	and I think that's probably what helped
A	yeah
B	but some of the people I actually worked with I'd sooner not talk about because I didn't like them very much
A	no no
B	and I had to put up with them
A	yeah mm I well I when I was nursing I had people like that and it was a bit like you
B	mm
A	you were on shifts
B	mm yeah
A	when you're nursing and you think oh I've got to put up with her
B	I know
A	you know for a
B	that's right
A	and and and and then I think well that's okay cos next week I'm gonna be on a different ward and then
B	yeah
A	she's gonna be somewhere else
B	yeah
A	and hopefully I'll get somebody nice
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well that's right well this was one particular character I worked with for twenty years in the same room
A	yeah really?
B	and I couldn't
A	really?
B	work I had to do
A	right
B	because of his inability to do the job properly
A	oh that's really hard isn't it?
B	and
A	no
B	but he was a West Indian
A	was he?
B	and he thought he'd learn the job very quickly and he never really did learn the job
A	right right
B	so er that and that's why I don't really want to talk about him
A	no
B	in particular
A	no well we can
B	but
A	steer on to other subjects while you were doing this job that you enjoyed so much for so many years what what what did you do in your leisure time?
B	cars
A	ah right and you're keen on cars obviously
B	mm not really
A	but you were
B	I I have been because I had a car I I I still have it it's my MG I love it
A	oh right
B	I also have a Range Rover which I built rebuilt mechanically
A	right
B	I thoroughly enjoyed doing that
A	right
B	and languishing in the back of the garage is my mother's old Ford
A	right
B	which I've been trying to get at since nineteen eighty
A	so you've got to make a bit of space to get there have you?
B	no time is the
A	time yeah
B	and stop
A	right
B	I've gotta stop being bone idle
B	no but er erm as you
A	all work a lot on their own
B	yeah
A	in er and to come out and do this it's great
B	it
A	that they can get to talk
A	yeah
B	as much as I don't mind the hard work
A	no no I'm sure you don't
B	I mean it's it's good fun
A	no
B	well
A	if if you're very very hard working
B	well this is the thing
A	yeah
B	about the job I did
A	yeah
B	the fact that a lot of the time I did nothing
A	yeah
B	but when there was work to be done it got done
A	yeah yeah
B	and I worked very
A	yeah
B	I mean it was not uncommon for me to go home at night and get called back in at ten o'clock
A	yeah
B	and work through to five o'clock the next morning
A	yeah well people will
B	er
A	keep asking you if they know you're gonna produce the goods won't they?
B	well that's right and
A	er
B	there were certain people there who would only ask for me
A	right yeah
B	because they knew the job would be done and it would be done properly
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	I suppose the work ethic I got came out of what I did when I first left school
A	oh
B	which was clinical pathology
A	oh right
B	you didn't know that did
A	no I didn't
A	no I didn't so you worked for the police then did you?
B	no
A	no
B	clinical
A	clinical clinical
B	I worked
A	pathology
B	in a hospital
A	ah right
B	counting blood cells
A	right
B	collecting blood about three years doing bacteriology
A	right
B	so
A	don't you think sometimes when you get your blood tested these days that you can be just under the bar for something?
B	mm
A	and and you know you may say thyroid take thyroid did you test for thyroid or er?
B	I don't well I
A	you can't remember?
B	I mostly did haematology which was
A	right
B	literally blood cell counting
A	right okay
B	literally by eye
A	really?
B	down a microscope
A	oh lord
B	counting chambers diluted to blood
A	and has that affected you eyesight in later life do you think?
B	no I don't think it has I've been I think I've been very lucky considering how long I was spent doing that
A	right
B	and when you're doing bacteriology there are times when you sit and look for an hour down the microscope at blank
A	right
B	because er hopefully there's nothing on the
B	but
A	patient is hoping that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean and the work quality has to be good
A	yeah
B	and er
A	one mistake and it changes someone's life doesn't it?
B	well that's right
A	mm
B	that's right
A	yeah so going back to the cars though I had an MG once what sort of make erm I had an MG MG Midget
B	mm
A	what sort of car is yours?
B	a B
A	an MGB erm and is it is that one with the hard top is it?
B	no
A	I can't
B	no
A	it's a soft top?
B	this is a soft top
A	oh right
B	it's a Roadster
A	oh right and do you go out in that much?
B	oh yeah
A	oh right
B	I've seen you at er
A	the rally
B	at the rallies at
A	right yeah yeah we we always
B	er
A	erm
A	we always
B	yeah I've been there for two years now
A	have you? yeah we've been well I met
B	mm
A	er I must admit I'm getting a bit fed up with it now
A	because I can't
B	mm
A	there's only
B	yeah
A	so much you can do it's very limited
B	oh yeah
A	every year I go in and you know the tent where they've got the craft people?
B	yeah
A	there's some people at the back who are in the same place every year
B	that's right
A	and I sometimes think that they've been there since
A	in the field since I left the year before
A	yeah
B	up around erm
A	right
B	and because I meet the same people it's like the
A	yeah
B	good company
A	yeah it is good company
B	erm it it it also leads you out into other things like last Sunday we went to the NEC to the classic
A	right
B	car show
A	right right
B	which was quite nice we went up on the coach so we had no worry about driving
A	oh yes yes
B	and we were dropped off within five minutes of it all and the thing is I'm also a member of a car club
A	yes well we are in unofficially of the Austin seven club
B	mm
A	it's not really a club but
B	no it's
A	we're just a lot of people who meet and we don't pay a subscription or anything
B	no but I actually belong to the Ford Sidevalve Owners Club
A	oh do you? right
B	and I'm the area contact for them
A	right oh do you?
B	which actually throws up odd things like
A	oh right yeah
B	so that the chap can get the registration done
A	yeah
B	which is quite interesting
A	yeah
B	the people you meet and the cars you look at
A	yeah yeah
B	so since I've been retired my life has become much more interesting
A	yeah
B	cos most of the car work I did before I retired was with a friend of mine who was actually a repairer
A	right right
B	and a lot of it was towing cars in for him to repair
A	yeah yeah
B	er
A	erm so erm your car now your B
B	mm
A	can you tell me erm have you got much more to do on it? or is it is it sort of all up together maintained and spotless?
B	er it's all up together but it needs a good coat of paint
A	does it? right
B	erm the
A	right oh did you? oh
B	in nineteen eighty-eight
A	right
B	going to work one morning
A	did you?
B	I'm lucky to be here actually
A	yeah
B	but that's beside the point
A	yeah
B	since then it's had a complete new body shell put on
A	right right
B	and it was one of the early heritage shells that came er literally as a body shell all the
A	right
B	were missing
A	yes
B	so I've I've actually rebuilt it up from
A	right
B	every nut and bolt and screw
A	right
B	rivet that's gone in
A	yeah
B	I know it because I put it in there
A	yeah yeah
B	so er
A	well we've got something in common then I had an accident in nineteen seventy-eight
B	yeah
A	well that's ten years before you
B	mm
A	it actually wasn't my fault I was driving to work in the morning
B	mm
A	I waited in the drive for erm one of my colleagues and er he hadn't turned up I used give him a lift and er had I gone he was late and had I gone
B	mm
A	at the time I should have gone I wouldn't have met the other man on the road
B	no that's true
A	you know but because I waiting for
B	mm
A	I was waiting for
B	mm
A	I had the accident and he just came towards me overtaking another car
B	mm
A	and hit me in the front spun the Mini round and the petrol tank burst into flames and I was trapped in a burning car well
B	not nice
A	I nearly died erm
B	mm
A	went to
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
B	yes
A	I mean that's what you say in those days
B	well that's right
A	when you could have a drink and go to the pub
B	well that's right
A	now you wouldn't
B	no
A	now you I mean
B	no
A	I certainly don't I don't drink at all now
B	no
A	hardly at all
B	well I don't either I mean
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	an orange juice
A	yeah yeah
B	but that is because the last job I did
A	oh right
B	and we had to be sober at nine o'clock
A	yeah
B	zero rated
A	yeah so
B	you know?
A	when he was going on the track
B	yeah that's right
A	every every track he went on you know he had to go on the track at night
B	yeah
A	he couldn't have a drink you know?
B	no that's right
A	used to say do you want a a drink no can't have a drink
B	no but my accident wasn't another car
A	no
B	it was an incompetent council
A	oh really?
B	who decided to put a pedestrian reserve in the middle of the road
A	yeah
B	without due warning
A	so you went over it did you?
B	I I went into it and
A	into it?
B	the car just stopped
A	oh
B	and in the back of the car I
A	right
B	the headlight
A	right
B	but had I not had a seatbelt on
A	right
B	I would have been thrown out
A	yeah
B	I didn't realise it was that
A	right
B	until it wouldn't the pain wouldn't go away and it was getting worse
A	oh I see yeah
B	because I'd suffered this pain on the
A	oh I see yeah
B	under the sternum
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	which was a muscular skeletal muscular thing
A	yeah having a heart attack is a very weird thing to sort of diagnose because there are so many things it could be like indigestion or
B	yeah
A	did I stretch up too far to put something down
B	right
A	from the shelf yesterday? you know
A	right what were your symptoms then?
B	extreme pain
A	yeah er just extreme pain
B	and and
A	in the heart area?
A	it's right from the sternum
B	and it wouldn't go away
A	anything down at your arm? they always say
B	no
A	down the left arm
B	no
A	don't they?
B	no it depends
A	palpitations?
B	no
A	no? headaches?
B	no
A	nausea?
B	no
A	no?
B	just pain and general weakness
A	right
B	and knowing that it was something serious
A	right
B	it was something up here
A	yeah
B	in my brain
A	yeah
B	that told me this but I saw my father had a heart attack you see
A	did you? yeah
B	he just walked into me and said I don't feel well and I felt his hands and looked at him and said no you go back to bed I'll get the doctor in
A	right right
B	this doctor said I think he's only indigestion
A	right
B	it was diagnosed that he'd had a heart attack
A	right
B	that morning
A	right
B	so
A	oh right what are doing on time here? oh only another two minutes to go
B	we're going well
A	and then you're you've served your sentence
B	yeah yeah
A	so erm er what might might be interested to know that after I had the accident I erm I was obviously badly burned and my face was burned
B	yeah
A	skin grafted all
B	yeah
A	er lots of places and erm I went out and I bought an MG Midget and a
B	mm
A	fur coat
B	odd deal
A	er
B	yeah
A	erm but it looked really nice and erm I had to get rid of it when they brought this fur thing in that you couldn't have fur
B	oh
A	but once it's in the shop and it's there
B	mm
A	and erm I've got treasure I bought my erm MG from a a solicitor friend of mine
B	mm
A	and erm er yes and it was so funny my father said we'd better have to looked over by the AA but I wasn't in the AA so they
B	mm
A	three
B	yeah
A	er we went to
A	but then of course
B	mm
A	as a result of that we came got quite good friends and his his then girlfriend
B	mm
A	became very good friends
B	yeah
A	erm isn't it funny how these things work out?
B	well that's right
A	yeah don't see them now
B	mm
A	I'm you know life goes on doesn't it?
B	yeah that's right
A	so so erm so when you get your mother's Ford out erm
B	mm
A	er and you get onto it can you see that happening in the near future?
B	I'm trying now I'm trying very hard to get the garage sorted so I can get in there and do something with it and er it it will happen slowly
A	it's finding the space isn't it?
B	it's not the space I had the space
A	you've got the
B	I had the garage rebuilt so there was space for it
A	oh really?
B	it's getting the junk out that I've managed to accumulate
A	yeah
B	in the garage
A	yeah that's right that's right
B	so so but with this weather I just don't get in you know
A	well you can't put things outside temporarily
B	no
A	while you're you're clearing up erm
B	well that's right
A	it is difficult erm maybe you could get one of those little those gazebos that are the same size as this
B	well that's
A	and put put
B	what I'm thinking about
A	you're thinking of getting yeah
B	yeah
A	because they are
B	but I've still got the bungalow to finish
A	you have yeah
A	have you done your erm paving yet? you were going to do some
B	mm

A	you've grouted that?
B	grouted it yes that's
A	you you've done that?
B	yes and I've
A	good
B	and I'm still getting worms coming up through the grass
A	oh are you? oh oh
B	but frustrating
A	a bit frustrating
B	yeah
A	I think we've done it okay
B	oh that's good
A	so erm
B	right
A	er er
