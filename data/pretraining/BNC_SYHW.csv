C	you wouldn't
A	I think I would have said that
B	I got them on the market
C	no you didn't
B	where did I get them from?
C	erm at the place at
B	oh yeah that little shop at
C	whose shop?
B	yeah
A	yeah the shop
C	it was on like the side of the road you told me
B	well it probably was I can't remember it's about six year ten years ago now when the kids were
C	yes it is so why are you keep going on about it?
B	because it's
A	because it's because it's only time
B	yeah
A	I've never brought you flowers so therefore it's embedded
B	and she ain't getting no more
A	just ungrateful wasn't it?
C	I only smiled I smiled it's the girls that said about
C	but I didn't
B	you did that's a bit of a giggle really ain't it? but that's it
A	I mean come on I'm not being funny
B	well next time she'll get a flower pot and a packet of seeds
A	yeah but she wouldn't she you know
B	they were half price
C	but I think they were thirty pence weren't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah thirty pence they were
B	no fifty pence
C	alright fifty sorry
B	come on
C	a bunch of anemones er no erm
A	chrysanths
C	oh asters
A	asters
B	they were lovely asters one of my favourite flowers
B	yes
C	you didn't have to tell me how much they cost either
B	and you didn't have to guess
C	god
A	that's cos you left price on
C	yes
B	I think there was two bunches in that lot cos I picked the colours out never again
B	that was
C	probably yeah
B	what garden did you nick them out of she said
A	yeah but that's something you would come out with
B	that's beside the point I trained her right ain't I
A	you see that's something you'd come out with
C	true
B	true
C	yeah when we
B	so I've only got myself to blame for
C	we had some pictures back down tonight and she
B	oh yeah to the Nutcracker
C	ballet
B	the ballet
C	and erm oh it's lovely
B	she's sitting with one of the ballet women
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	and one of the stage hands
A	ah
C	yeah it's this girl treat out
B	yeah yeah and they they keep sending us some lovely pictures I mean
C	mm
B	and I've got we got a card from her this morning didn't we?
C	yeah at the same time
B	from her and it said er hope the beer's alright looking forward to the beer and I took the handle off of the beer barrel
A	what the tap or the handle?
B	the tap that broke the tap handle
C	mm
A	so what's happened to all the beer?
B	well I had to go and get my Stillsons and shift and close it up and then I had to drill a hole through the top of the tap and put a little bit of wire through it so I could use the wire and switch it on like that turn it on with the wire and then I'll have to buy a new tap when when we get rid of the beer
C	I think you should bottle
B	does that frighten you?
C	no
B	that's alright
C	no
B	it's too much of a problem with it you've got to sterilise all the bottles
A	you've got to sterilise the bottles you've got to store them then haven't you?
B	yeah you've got to put the lids on haven't you?
A	yeah
B	we've got all the gear to do it with but
C	mm
B	that's a lot of work for I mean that'll be gone this Christmas so what's the point?
B	I mean they'll drink most of it
A	I'm surprised you've got some left now
B	well I'll get it and try a couple of glasses I have had a couple of glasses
A	I did have a couple of glasses of whisky
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	what not that nice one? oh
A	I tried to get er I
A	and she went it's better without the water
B	oh
A	but I did have a couple of glasses
B	oh well why not that's what it's there for
A	I felt like I needed to have a couple of glasses well only one glass a night but I did feel like it
B	yeah very nice you can make a glass of whisky last well a half a pint lasts for ages
A	half a pint
A	no I'd
C	but is it very different it's just not you know not just weaker or something else?
A	it has
C	oh
B	supposedly this this woman told me I don't know how she knew but she said when you drink whisky straight that's fine you can have more whisky straight than you can have whisky with water because whisky with water will get into your bloodstream quicker
A	yeah
C	oh does it?
B	than straight whisky
A	because it's because it's that little bit thinner and water goes it's absorbed
B	yeah
A	more water is absorbed isn't it?
B	in the gut
A	but it it has a it has a a sweeter taste to it this whisky has a sweeter taste to it
C	oh
A	when you put some water in it when you put pure
C	so you prefer it?
A	erm I don't mind either way
B	no
A	but it it's just I I've never thought it would make such a difference I always thought like you it makes it
C	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	and it's amazing just how different it is
B	yeah
C	mm
A	absolutely amazing
A	absolutely amazing so
B	even Morrison's have got litres now litres at fifteen pounds a litre
A	yeah well that's a blend isn't it?
B	well
A	you see
B	yeah
A	that's a blend even though it's a single malt
B	yeah? what a blend of single malts is it?
A	what they do is they have they make all the Bushmill whisky and they make it all
B	yeah
A	they they put it in the the bond etcetera and then they tip it all out into one big vat to mix it
B	oh right
A	to get the characteristics of the Bushmill
B	yeah
A	which is I never thought of it like that but that's what they do where others will put it in their barrels and each one is slightly different
B	yeah
A	it'll still have the same kind of taste but the Bushmills taster has to blend it so it's always the same taste
B	oh right
C	oh
B	I wonder if you can get a job as a taster?
A	yeah as a take you as a trainer yeah
B	it does yeah but what how do they start?
A	that's what I mean you've got to have I suppose you've got to be in the company and they've got to say you know?
C	erm
A	yeah but it's all
B	oh it's got a touch of mm mm blackberry and I'm getting creosote and I'm getting and you think creosote what the hell are you talking about you know? and if a if a glass of wine tasted like creosote I'd I'd have to send it back
A	it's the tannin isn't it? so
B	you know you don't wanna taste creosote do you?
C	perhaps not that one
A	no
B	Jilly Goolden that's her name
C	peaty and that
A	peaty
B	well she said creosote
C	did she really?
B	yes she did god yes she did she was only on there the other day
A	is she still about?
B	and they were taking the micky out of her
A	is she still about?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	she looked exactly the same as she did as the hundred and twenty years ago
A	she's still about
C	yeah and yet erm Oz Clarke isn't it the other one?
B	yeah Oz Clarke he does it too
C	and so different
B	yeah
C	because he's totally bald isn't he now?
A	yeah
C	he wasn't when he was doing it
B	yeah but they should have them back together
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	strange
B	and er she she she was drinking this wine and he was standing next to her and she was she was giving her oh what a taste of like ham sandwiches and creosote and all this that and the other and it's got the taste of blackberries and Ox Clarke was just standing with his wine and going uh pulling this face with his mouth wide open thinking whatever is she on about?
B	but she is clever
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	well they
C	they know how much they can allow
A	yeah
B	they do
A	did you see the road's gonna be closed?
B	which one?
A	this one
B	why?
A	there's a notice saying that it's closed for four days
B	what
C	what
A	by the golf course
B	what our golf course is it?
A	no you know where it is?
B	on the corner yeah
C	mm
A	it's
B	on the corner yeah on the corner
A	you know where
B	yeah it's that corner
A	it's it's on that the it can't be the corner because the corner land belongs to the house
B	oh right
A	you know the the house that was sold a couple of years ago?
B	what
C	yeah
A	yeah I think so
B	yeah
B	it is yeah
A	right? it's the land behind that and along the side
B	oh right
A	and they wanna put twenty-five houses in there
B	yeah they're so far they've they've not got permission apparently according to Street Life
C	and it's cut it down to
B	and they've cut it down to
C	what eighty?
B	eighty I think
A	what there?
B	yeah
A	well the the idea was wasn't it if they didn't build the ninety houses
B	up there
A	over on the road
C	but it's not the same people though
B	it's the people who live in in the house
C	it's yeah
B	in in
C	they'd put that one in
A	they've put it in have they?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah whereas the other ones they've put in for
B	yeah they put in for
A	yeah
C	mm
B	they've put in for houses on on the rest of that land
A	behind the school?
B	yeah
C	but this one is a private one really it's just the guy that moved in there
B	but I didn't know they had a great big protest along that road
A	mm
B	loads of loads of people
C	yeah
A	yeah I saw it in miscellaneous just a few people
A	yeah but
B	well they've got lines of people up there
A	it's only a single road isn't it? a line of
B	yeah yeah but I mean at least they had people out there doing it
C	mm
A	yeah well to be honest
B	eighty-odd houses is no good because it's just gonna all as they say it's gonna overrun the doctor's and and the school because the school isn't built for it
A	yeah but the problem is we have there aren't that many children in
B	no?
C	but they
A	so the school in theory could close because there's only a small number coming through
B	yeah
C	oh
A	so the the effects of not having cos if you think about it the village hasn't got that many young people in it
B	no no it's an older village now isn't it?
C	mm
A	erm and it all depends on how many preschool will give you some idea of how many students
B	yeah
A	will come will come through
B	yeah
A	but I I was under the impression there's a little bit of a dip at the moment with the number of kids in
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	it must be the water
C	mm
B	but if if they're going to try and build eighty houses down there down at
A	well if you think where it is
C	mm
A	and if you come off the
B	yeah yeah
A	you don't have to come down
B	eighty houses a hundred and sixty people that's just a hundred people a hundred
A	that's two people per house
B	two people and if you say three and a half people per house which they reckon is average three and a half people then you've got eighty
A	you
B	three eights three eights
A	that's two hundred and forty basically
B	two hundred and forty-two hundred and fifty
A	your your big issue the only issue
A	I would say that you would have the only erm this is thinking about what's happened at
B	no they won't will they?
C	yeah no
A	erm and therefore it goes to social housing
B	yeah
A	and you'll have social housing people that end of the village
B	yeah
A	which is not knocking people in social housing or anything
B	no no
A	but that that's what
C	mm
A	or you'll or you'll have
B	will they be houses or bungalows that's the point? cos most of the places and they're actual bungalows haven't they? there's some houses down that way
A	yeah what you all the houses
B	and there's houses along the
A	there's there's bungalows all along which if you think about what's erm because you've got is it
B	oh yeah
B	yeah what's her name who paints?
C	erm
A	no no cos she's
B	oh you mean the other one right up er up that long lane?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	you've got
B	yeah
A	then you've got houses from there
B	yeah
A	and then on that then you've got that big house the big white house by the bus stop just before you get to
B	yeah yeah
A	what's the road called as you go around like the back of
C	mm
A	as you come down and those are all houses along there
B	yeah I know where you mean
C	yeah
A	so so the houses need
C	mm
A	so if they put houses there it wouldn't make any difference
B	no
A	because you've got the houses on that side
C	mm
B	but then as as a as a good way into the
A	but you see they did the watercourse there a couple of years ago
B	yeah
A	so they knew something was happening
B	yeah
A	cos they actually strengthened the bridge there
B	yeah and another thing is the new waterworks they're putting up that's going to supply
C	and there was a water tower
B	yeah and there was a water tower down there a big green water tower weren't there? but there was still no water pressure and then they had to pump the water up from
A	yeah
B	I mean they've been boring for ages now haven't they? you can hear it going every day of the week and er well that'll get the water up
A	is that the boring or is that the concrete mix cos they've got that big
B	yeah they've also got that but they've been boring as well with a big crane and ballum-ballum ballum-ballum ballum-ballum going down and down and down
A	drilling down
B	so they've got to bore anyway to get the water out and they can't pump all that water up from
B	it must be there's more water on the top of the hill than there is through the bottom there it's weird innit? cos Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water yeah
A	so
B	I think it's really weird when you get erm you get up in in the Dales and and and you get water coming down all the time
A	yeah
B	all the time
A	yeah it's just a permeation through the rock isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and it finds it's an easy way out
B	you think it weren't ever going to stop doesn't it?
A	they had some nice snow up there at the weekend
B	did they?
A	nice snow in the lakes and the lake
B	mm
B	but they had er very bad snow in Scotland didn't they?
A	yeah
B	the snow ploughs and everything out
C	mm mm
B	they were getting stuck and everyone was getting stuck as long as that don't get down here I wouldn't mind snow on Christmas Day
A	it's supposed it's supposed to be a white Christmas isn't it?
B	is it? I haven't heard
C	oh
A	it's supposed to be a white Christmas
B	oh we get one
B	white Christmas every fifty years they reckon
A	I suppose it's about right
B	yeah
A	sixty-three
B	sixty-three yeah
A	well well that's fifty-two years ago isn't it? so
B	yeah yeah it will be about right
A	but it's around about every ten years we get a white Christmas
B	well I can't remember a white Christmas to be honest with you they call it a white Christmas if one good if one snowflake fall on the on the on the place in
A	yeah in each each each
B	yeah that's right
A	so I think it's Cardiff in Wales Glasgow in Scotland and then London in England
B	yeah
C	really?
A	yeah
B	and you only have to have a few snowflakes falling and they call it a white
C	it has to be there and not?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it can't be anywhere else it has to be there
C	oh
B	yeah
C	that's my most
B	that's funny how you get
C	white Christmas
B	memories like that I remember going to the flea pit the Ritz it was called up the
C	mm
A	it must have been sixty-seven I think sixty-seven sixty-eight rings rings a bit of a bell I asked for a sledge at Christmas
B	oh right
A	I wanted a sledge for Christmas and I wanted snow
B	yeah
A	that was the two things I asked for
C	right
A	and there was there was no sign of it was likely to be snowing alright? and then all of a sudden something changed and we did wake up on Christmas Day with snow and I was able to use my sledge
C	lovely
A	and it was and that I remember it I remember it because I remember taking Christmas presents around to my sister's
B	were you on your sledge?
A	on my sledge and and
B	did he?
A	and I remember taking them around and that was the year we had snow at Easter
B	yeah
A	and I was able to take Easter eggs on my sledge around
A	and I and I
B	yeah
A	and I was out I was out playing and there were I can't remember his name but there was a guy that used to come in our shop and he was like an odd job man type thing and he did odd jobs for my mum and like put the fence up and stuff like that and I don't know what it is well but I was I can remember talking to him and he was telling me about the way the clouds were coming over and
B	yeah
A	that we were gonna have some more snow and we were gonna have a load of snow and it was before anything and we did have a load of snow
B	we seemed to have lots of snow when we were younger than than we get now I mean we got nothing last year did we?
A	no nothing last year
B	I mean that was mild all the way through I don't think the temperature dropped during the day
A	no the year before we had snow
B	yeah we did
A	the year before we had snow
C	then we had snow at Christmas when erm
B	oh yes we had to take her to hospital
C	and er broke her arm
B	she'd broke her arm
