B	yeah
A	to sit down and the German teacher's sitting opposite you on the table er you sit there and then he asks goes through the questions and then you answer them but he missed three of my questions off so it was a bit easier like that
B	ah
A	he did say it wasn't quite long enough but other than that no it went really well
B	now did you have sight of the questions beforehand?

C	yeah
A	the pole came down so he picked it chucked it into the road
C	what pole?
A	the pole that he ran into cos he had a year in the territorial army so he's trained so if you get hit on the head you get the thing and you chuck it in chuck it away from him

A	well we'd charge obviously but
D	yeah
B	I was amazed
B	at the age of the people at the ceilidh
C	I tell you what it's a lovely sight
D	you mean there was a lot of youngsters there?
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
B	it was brilliant
A	do you wanna come with us to one? cos there's a lot of people who just sit down around the side and
C	it's very European the er this the way the generations mix
B	yes I was amazed
C	what? six and seven were falling asleep by the end but from that age right up
B	mm
C	er and they all they all mix
B	well you could see that
D	they we're good dancers that crowd
C	they all mix really well
B	yes
D	no that's Scottish
D	we we follow a more English sort of
A	oh yeah it is
B	erm yeah because you know if you're doing this very rigid stuff
A	aye you'll you'll have to
D	no
A	oh yeah
B	the
A	Gay Gordon's
D	we do that
A	we do Gay Gordons yeah
D	we do that we do Strip the Willow
C	oh Strip the Willow that was that's on the video Strip the Willow

B	do you dance to that? do you
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh no no don't no
C	why?
A	it's
D	I'll show you later
C	we made it up
D	we
C	that's why
B	oh
D	no no we devised it she means
D	we tell them
A	we tell them
C	oh yeah
A	we tell them that it's our invention
C	mm
C	it's it's
A	yeah yeah it's
C	oh yeah yeah but that's
A	mm
C	oh
B	yeah
A	do you often talk about
C	they it's so that we can use what they can play do you see what I mean?
B	yes
A	oh come on that's a bit patronising to be honest
D	what?
C	well that's what you keep telling me
A	we can only do what you what they can do
C	so because they're cos they're good at the
D	well
C	no I've got dances in
D	we do have to yeah we do have to match em up yeah
A	mm
C	that's what I'm saying
B	mm
C	we've got to match them up so
D	and you wanna do what's the next one you wanna do?
C	because because that er
B	right
C	it's very very simple to be honest
B	are are are you
D	no
C	no they're all old they're really old
A	no the minute the minute they're born they're automatic
A	that's the way international
B	are you sure?
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah but the way but the way
A	oh no they're old
C	they're so old
B	oh no I was meaning the ones
B	that they made up
D	we do a lovely one
A	well it's more I made them up really
D	called the A nineteen set cos they're tunes just from the villages round about here
B	hey that's good
D	yeah people like them and they're good
B	yeah from the fiddler of
D	mm
A	so if I write a tune I don't need to
B	mm
A	there's no procedure it's er automatically copyrighted
B	but what about copyright on literary works?
C	if you put a C with a circle round it it's it's
A	you don't even need to put the C
D	did you?
B	and I sent it off
D	and they ripped you off
B	erm yeah well
B	no surprise there
B	two or three
A	ah
C	oh
B	and it was so personal
A	well you can't copyright an idea
C	you can't copyright a line and an idea
D	what was the story about?
B	oh it was just about something that had happened a garage you
D	you didn't send it to People's Friend by mistake?
B	no I sent it to the
D	no?
B	Woman's Weekly
A	yeah but to be honest you can't copyright an idea you can only copyright the
D	you can copyright a short story though can't you?
C	yeah but it was just a similar storyline you wouldn't
D	yeah
B	yeah but it was obvious that it was the one I had put forward
C	yeah
B	so I've never sent any more after that
A	oh that's happened to me before
B	has it love?
A	yeah
B	ah
D	what happened?
A	er
B	oh is your heart going?
C	you can't copyright a title can you?
A	I keep missing the closing date for that
C	you can't copyright a title
B	so so what's this about putting a circle with a C?
C	mm
A	that's just a symbol to remind people that it's copyright you don't need one for it to be copyright it's just sort of like to remind people or to scare people into not photocopying it cos if it's not there you're likely to go and photocopy it or pass it off as your own but if it is there then it reminds you a bit more
B	okay so I maybe should've put that on? yeah
D	when
C	computers make things easier because you've got proof on your computer
B	it was after you and
D	right
C	oh there would be computers then
B	erm no I typed
D	was it called The Twitcher?
B	no that
D	oh
B	now if you ever want that if I come across it
D	what wa's that? what is it?
B	it's a short story your dad tried
D	ah
B	and
B	but he had an idea about er a a story for a woman's magazine about the twitcher if I can find copies do you want them?
D	I think I've seen it before a few times
B	I'm sure you have
D	yeah
B	yeah
B	and he wanted me to write it but I couldn't get the birding stuff in properly because that wasn't my area
D	mm
B	he went on about
D	The Twitcher
B	mm because we'd just been up to
D	yeah
B	what was it called? that nature reserve?
D	good idea
B	this this bloke had sort of come in and
D	twitchers are a real presence aren't they?
A	what would what would they what would the fee be for
C	nowadays
B	I don't know
D	not not bad probably
B	well I can tell you in nineteen fifty-eight it was twenty pounds
D	god that's a lot
A	god yeah
C	mm
B	it was a lot mm
D	yeah yeah
A	it won't be that much now
C	no
D	not
A	it'll probably be about twenty pound
D	no it's more than that
B	no no I was looking it up one time
A	no it'll be ninety quid
D	no it'll be more than that
A	yes it'll be
B	do you think four
D	I don't know how many words is it?
B	well you can have them up to three thousand words
D	things have tailed off a bit recently
A	oh has it?
D	mm
B	look I haven't done any research in this area since I came over here so what I'm talking about are figures before we came
A	you could pick it up
B	and it was talking about there were four grades A B C and D
D	right
B	and it gave you the magazine which grade they were in and things like
D	for different
A	personality
D	what about My Dog Monthly? do they have
A	there's no such thing
B	you've made that up as you go along
D	no no no
A	it's Your Dog
C	there'll be there'll be something similar
A	it's Your Dog
C	Your Dog Your Dog
A	your
A	and
C	yeah
D	so is it like a religious thing every month she gets the new edition of Your Cat?
A	no but she er she reads it now and again
B	does she still have cats?
A	she's got cats yeah
D	loads
C	how many?
B	oh I love them
A	they're horrible
C	I forgot er
A	is
B	I've just bought it
C	she says it's only a quid for a shoehorn
B	I've got it I've got it yeah
B	mm
A	yeah they give you some crayons and you colour in
B	you've got six crayons and about ten different
A	you can easily get er be careful cos you the next issue'll be six ninety-nine or seven ninety-nine
C	yeah
B	no it's two ninety-nine
A	oh then they build you up they get you hooked
A	and then they start
A	then they start charging after about the tenth issue
B	it doesn't work with me
A	they'll start charging six or seven ninety-nine if if you want me to print some colouring pages off the computer I can do that for you
B	no no
B	and I don't even know whether I'm gonna use it but I just thought
A	they do those like build a ship and
B	or a dinosaur
A	or knit something and it's
C	I remember when
A	that horse one yeah
C	horse or farm
B	yeah
A	horse
B	well I used to get a knitting one and it never got more than two ninety-nine
A	no
B	yeah it does mm
A	usual price six or seven ninety-nine
B	well usual price for these are two ninety-nine
A	it'll it'll it goes up though after that it the first five are cheap and then after that they're expensive
B	oh well in that case it if its got some good pencils I'll get
A	yeah they might be moving onto I'm trying to think fifty issues they'll struggle to think of different art things to do after that but they might be doing things like watercolours or something in the end
B	well it was art therapy and I thought it
C	you don't you don't need to be an artist for art therapy
B	no course you don't er er apparently it's very de-stressing
C	it is if you if you get in touch with your inner child you use your non-dominant hand and do do stuff
B	ah I've been reading about that
C	do stuff with that
B	did you know if you want to write something really meaningful it was suggested that you use your non-dominant hand?
A	oh well in badminton on Thursday there's two of us that take it seriously and there was a doubles tournament so what we did we played left handed we still beat everyone seven nil
A	but we played with our left hand instead
A	so er that helped us be
B	but can you write with your left hand?
A	no but I play badminton with it
B	cos your your grandad could write with either hand
A	I can't write with my left hand
B	I could always tell which hand he was writing with
A	the person I sit next to in English broke their left hand which was their main hand so they had to write with their right hand and honestly you couldn't tell after a week of having to use their right hand fully you just couldn't tell at all
C	mm
B	well I had a time when I was using my left my right hand and I was getting
C	mm
B	well one of them had gone to school oh
C	mm
B	and so
C	yeah it's awful isn't it?
B	isn't it terrible?
C	in er early years now they do a lot of stuff with erm maybe something like spaghetti because a lot of children especially if they're in nurseries from the year dot they don't raise their arms very high and so they get them
B	really?
C	pulling out spaghetti because they don't even know which their dominant hand is so they get them pulling spaghetti out of a ball with their right hand
A	just give them a football and see which one they kick it with
C	how how high can you lift it? now pull with your left hand how high can you lift it?
B	do you know that is so sad
C	they get up to age five and six
A	just I know what you can do push them over and see which foot
C	oh
C	so and doing cheerleader things giving them things to shake above their head that helps them find their dominant hand but often it takes a lot longer these days especially for being in nursery from a very young age
D	you could do a bakery class and the
A	that's a small
D	I know
C	well
D	look at it it just shrinks every
D	I'm telling you now
D	I bet you no go on please
C	if you gave a
A	the sleeves are too
D	I wanna see if it fits you cos
C	if you gave
D	every jumper I ever get shrinks
A	I'll put it on later
D	mm?
C	if you give a reception child a spoon whatever hand you put it in they would
D	well that's good
C	that's what I'm saying
D	you can teach them to be ambidextrous
C	yeah but they will
B	yeah but it's not very many
C	no most of them will develop a dominant hand
B	mm
A	right
C	so it's given them the opportunity
B	mm
C	to develop it or find it early on
D	right
B	there's still suspicion not not not now when I was left-handed there was still a lot of suspicion about people who were left-handed
C	right
D	were sinister
B	yeah sinister exactly
A	unnatural
C	what
A	ah yeah we've had a nice week
D	yep
A	looking for er any plans for the holidays?
B	well I've got a a grandson
C	Easter
B	and he's called
B	and I'm hoping he'll come up and he'll look at my computer for me
A	what is it you want me to do?
B	well I just want look er when I switch it on
A	yeah
B	do you leave yours switched on all the time?
D	no
A	no never not at all
B	why not? I'm asking cos I
A	no point leaving your computer on cos it's if you're not using it it's just using up power for no reason
B	cos I was told you know I've got the internet
A	oh yeah
B	they said leave that switched on permanently
A	oh leave the internet well since we're on BT we're
D	some people do
A	supposed to so then other people can use it as a hot spot cos that's part of like the contract we had but to be honest no one round here really uses it cos if if you're next door they've got BT next door's got BT so there's not a lot of point us having ours on
B	right okay erm I switch my computer on and it take ages you know okay I get these things from
A	yeah
B	and by the time I've got onto the third one it's printing properly but the first one takes ages
D	to print? or just to come up?
B	no to come up the printing symbols to come up you know I
D	is it receiving data? is that what it says?
B	well no look I've I've got the erm the email on my computer
D	yeah
B	and I go to the little sign for a printer
D	saying print
B	and I click on that and a little square comes up to say how many pages you want it
D	yeah
B	well in the first instance that will take ages
D	to come up?
B	yes
D	always?
B	always at the first
A	is this the first thing you do when you switch your computer on?
A	yeah I'll have a look at with your start-up processes if er if the first one's taking a long time you might have a lot of stuff that's programmed to happen as soon as you turn your computer on that you might not even want so if you sort of disable some of those then the turning on process will be a lot quicker and sort of the first sort of things you do
D	mm
D	is this a new computer?
B	yeah well it's er a year old er it freezes and you know
A	I'll do a malware check as well
D	shouldn't do that
A	it sounds like you either have malware or it's just a poor processor
B	what's malware?
A	just anything that you don't want on your computer that starts clogging up the space and
A	no malware's sort of like a virus or a Trojan or a PUP or something
D	or a
B	oh well that's now I've also
B	you asked what I was doing
B	I've also got the same grandson he's gonna come down to the tip with me
A	yeah
C	just tell us when you're going cos we've got stuff
B	right okay
C	we'll all go down
B	I want to put the printer in
A	I don't think I've ever been there before ever
B	and I just thought
C	need you to lift things out
B	you you
A	I've never been allowed out the car there before
D	it was a long time
C	er a set-top box?
B	yeah to to get on to
C	it's not a very good one if you've got a better one
B	well you can have it er
A	oh brilliant
C	our top box is poor
B	oh well you can have it
A	please don't call it a top box
B	erm I got it plugged in I got it when I got
C	nanny's just called it that
A	we call it a set-top box
B	it's maybe five years old
A	ours is fifteen years old
