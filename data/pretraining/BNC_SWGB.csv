A	we would actually become alcoholics though
B	well maybe but might not
A	is that a problem?
B	I don't think it's a problem for me
A	no well I think
B	oh this is nice
B	well yes but
A	uh
B	yeah
A	er big armchairs
B	shall we
B	we could drum up
A	I know
B	touch the floor in this chair
A	ah
A	bit of a child
B	I am a child
B	mentally
A	oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	bit of glamour
A	that's what it needs
A	if you're gonna have some sort of cabaret affair going on you
B	when I went in there on Friday it was
A	oh
B	with like pens and notepads and that
A	were you there at four thirty-one?
B	I was there at four thirty-one
A	that's what you get you see
B	I just dragged
A	I think that's how you have to er you know
B	mm
A	proposition these things
B	that's true
A	just give them no choice
B	yeah
A	it's beer o'clock
B	we literally had the
B	and I was like do you want to come and get a drink?
A	nice
B	no probs
A	it did get to three thirty and I had to
B	oh the interviews were so long
A	huh
B	so drawn out
A	time they take up
B	and so then
A	mm
A	yeah
B	and I was like oh do I have to?
B	er no they don't know
A	oh
B	money for
A	yeah
B	so
A	nice
B	no they don't find out until July
A	mm
B	but during this point er where's she going? Er like
A	everyone's going to Mongolia at the moment
B	are they?
A	yeah
B	who's going to Mongolia?
A	some editor that I was talking to recently
B	oh yeah
A	with the yep
B	oh
A	huh
B	it's not Mongolia
A	Montenegro?
B	it's not Montenegro
A	Monaco?
B	hot
A	Samoa?
B	hm
A	Mozambique?
B	mm
A	mm
B	I think it is Mozambique
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	tut
B	so because her boyfriend um is butterfly man
A	er er obviously
B	yeah
A	as in he's half-butterfly?
B	I think he might be
A	tut
B	um
A	licks?
B	probably both
A	tut
B	yeah
A	mm
B	few of his like people he works with
A	oh right
B	but
A	nice
B	onto this trip
A	so er is she just gonna have to take holiday from work?
B	yeah
A	so how
B	it's like a month I think
A	yeah
B	exactly
A	oh
B	imagine
A	although you do get to go to Mozambique
B	I think I know yeah
A	I think it it'd be such a culture shock
B	yeah
A	perfect then in that case
B	or anything
A	yeah
B	she's not really that sort of er person
A	I don't think she  I don't think she  needs to worry about that
B	maybe I should invite
A	yeah
B	do you think?
A	yeah
B	I know
B	and he'll be like
A	that's gonna make tomorrow er very difficult
B	yes
A	is there a chance that you could work from home tomorrow?
B	no
A	from home I mean
B	no chance
A	pass out
B	unless I rang in sick
B	no
A	Don't listen tape
A	there's a lot of stuff that I wonder
B	I know
A	what has been recorded
B	well cos you forget after a while don't you like
A	you do forget
B	for er for the first like five minutes you remember but then after that you're just like anyway guess what?
B	but yeah
A	it's good
B	well
A	um
B	right
A	A Dutch barge
B	uh-huh
A	and I'm gonna buy it in Holland
B	right
A	I've thought it all out
B	so that's a bit of a  bit of a  commute
A	no no no
B	excellent
B	uh-huh
A	I can't swim
B	right
A	and I can't sail
B	and both
B	canal boats aren't really fit for the sea
A	um they
B	really?
A	my uncle's the one who put the idea in my brain
B	really? You can
A	I was gonna buy a barge
B	right
A	it's all very doable
B	uh-huh
A	runs a company that takes on kids that have been expelled from school
B	so you're gonna get some chavs
A	and he sails
B	to sail your
A	the chavs are not coming on the barge
A	he runs excursions
B	uh-huh
A	to scare them into behaving
B	right
A	it er sounds quite
B	it's gonna work
A	well he's got er he's got a boat himself that he takes them out on
B	oh right
A	and there's no time to play the big I am
B	yeah
A	which I think is what a lot of the er
B	yeah yeah
A	you know teenage boys are all about
B	yeah
A	you can't really do that
B	have you broached this barge across the Channel idea with him?
A	yep
B	are you being serious?
A	yeah
B	er
A	deadly serious
B	right
A	and here they're twenty
B	okay
A	so I buy one for myself
B	uh-huh
A	that's mine
B	right
A	and then the next one can be mine
B	okay
A	I mean er the barges that I did see when I researched
B	mm
A	this weren't two grand
B	right
A	they were twenty-seven euro twenty-seven thousand euro
B	right
A	so what I need to find out er from my uncle is whether this is realistic
B	can you really sail a barge across the English Channel?
A	I think you have to find out stuff like shipping lanes et cetera
B	P and O
A	ferry
B	no
B	but I mean like is it not too wavy? Hm?
A	no I don't think so
B	mm
A	is it wavy? It's only the Channel
B	it's quite wavy
A	well if you think like as we know my geography's really good
A	so if you
B	oh
A	if you think that this is the bottom of the UK
B	right
A	this is Dover
B	er
A	yeah
B	oh okay then
A	so that's Dover
B	uh-huh
A	here's Europe
B	uh-huh
A	and then Holland is like here isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	not too bad
A	success
B	yeah but
A	so it's in the straight isn't it
B	I think it is all
A	is my theory
B	kind of open sea
A	yeah
B	it's not just like er does not it's not just like you know a small lake you know
A	you have to sail it into the rivers
B	right
A	so you'd have to like maybe you'd come in on the Norfolk Broads
B	okay
A	in so up the Channel into the North Sea
B	right
B	do send us a postcard
B	from hospital
A	isn't there
B	I think it might
B	I think you've just
B	written a new one
A	uh
B	well it's an interesting idea
A	tut
B	uh-huh
A	because also there's the plan to run away
B	yeah
A	which is always a viable plan
B	so hang on
A	yeah
B	right
A	because what I'd quite like to do is do that and then if I do move away I've got something stable
B	you can just take it with you
A	like A I could take it with
A	probably not
B	yeah
A	Atlantic
B	get the barge involved
A	how I mean how many miles do you think that is?
B	Don't know
A	it's not like the Pacific
B	mm
A	yeah
B	no
A	maybe around Africa?
B	somali pirates?
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	that'd be quite nice
B	do you not have to er get them shipped on a bigger ship? Does the barge not have to go inside a bigger ship?
A	um
B	could you not just pay for someone else to get it over here? As in not like undertake this crazy let's go left at the
B	at the Channel
B	get to Dover
B	and then we'll be at the Norfolk Broads
A	um
B	for you
B	yeah? Well it's always good to be confident
A	tut
B	yeah
A	tut
B	yeah
A	I mean um I need to capitalize on
B	why don't you like delegate it to him?
A	tut
B	right
A	and er
B	now
B	but um
A	hey
B	knowing what I do about your navigational directional skills
A	yeah but if I had er
B	obviously you mean project directing the project not
A	direct the project
B	oh right
A	not actually navigate
B	no
A	us across the Channel
B	I see
A	because he very much knows that that'd be um
B	yeah
A	a death sentence
B	turns left
A	turn left
A	on the Norfolk Broads
B	your left or my left?
B	oh that's funny
A	yeah
B	no
A	well I well the first one has to be for profit
B	yeah
A	so what I'll
A	sailing the boat
B	uh-huh
A	in being sailed in the boat
B	yeah
A	by
B	do you like him enough to live in a boat a small boat with him for a week?
A	well I do like him yeah
B	yeah?
A	date
B	yeah?
A	A long it was a long time ago
B	rekindle a
A	but
B	involving twenty thousand pounds
B	sailing across the Channel
B	in barges
A	um
B	Cos if it is it's
A	it's a bit extreme
B	it's the latest in a long line of crazy
A	even by my standards
B	even by your standards
A	um
B	no
A	far
A	do you wanna go out for dinner? Well we are next Tuesday
B	well there you go
B	uh-huh
A	er the reason I invited him was because I know that he can sail
B	I see
A	sail
B	yeah
A	so that's why he's involved in the project
B	yeah
A	well you know the
B	yeah
A	embryonic stages of
B	of the project
A	tut
B	oh
A	so tut it's a plan
B	but if that all falls in?
A	if that all falls apart um I dunno what I'm gonna do with the money
B	yeah
A	a little bit now cos we're at the end of the month
B	yeah
A	but it's only a hundred quid so that's fine
B	yeah
A	overdraft gone
B	yeah
A	so that's a really nice feeling
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	so
A	so
B	that's pretty good
A	so this month so for April I'll keep it in my account and then the payment that'll come in for May for the
B	yeah
A	April recordings I'll put in my savings account for New York
B	mm
A	New York
B	oh your
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's certainly the plan that I've been telling everybody
B	yeah
A	that will take up quite a lot of the
B	yes
A	savings
B	yeah
A	more low key
B	yeah
A	for our thirtieth
B	but you would have a party here anyway wouldn't you? I mean
A	we'd have a party
B	well you'd go out for some drinks at some point er with the people that you know in Cambridge
B	let's be fair
A	just you
B	I'm not sure I can
A	beer
B	make it to New York but er I'll certainly
A	but er well even if I did go to New York there'll
B	mm
A	definitely be birthday drinks here
B	mm
A	because her birthday's November so we were thinking
B	yeah
A	we'd go like some time er end of November
B	oh that'll be lovely
A	certainly do something here
B	I'll have to tell you some places to go
A	tut
B	went to a gig there
A	mm
B	but like obviously the subways just go anywhere everywhere so
A	nice
B	a really nice building
A	mm
B	and it's like um it's a bit like imagine if like a sort of smallish theatre but with all the seats stripped out
A	mm
B	and so there's like a stage and it's got a kind of like dome sort of shape
A	oh okay
B	um and they have like bands on all the
A	mm
B	but it's just good
A	mm
B	like hipsters
A	mismatching clothes
B	see what's you know grandad jumpers and that and and it was good to just see sort of what was happening
A	tut
B	so
A	that's the thing isn't it
B	yeah
A	Cos we're only going for a few days
B	I'll have to try and find out where I went
A	yep
B	oh
A	tired with work um
B	how's she finding the apartment?
A	she really likes it
B	yeah?
A	last week into a hotel cos some authors came
B	yeah
A	and now she's back
B	mm
A	she's basically just managed to swing a job
B	yeah?
A	because they've I dunno if you've heard about it but they've split the responsibilities of our manufacturing department
B	oh right
A	so that half of them are in charge of stock levels
B	right
A	all that sort of business
B	mm
A	sourcing paper and
B	yeah
A	which is great but it means that some people have ended up with quite a lot of work on them
B	er er yeah
A	what is his name? And Peter
B	uh-huh
A	is in charge of procurement
B	yeah
A	so she's now got a line report in New York
B	oh my goodness
A	for two weeks? So er everyone's signing it off
B	oh
A	where the er yeah Thailand
B	mhm
A	and he's flying
B	oh my God
A	Cos I was thinking if you're in Thailand I know my geography's bad but would you not fly across the Pacific round?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I think some I um is it  is it  not about refuelling?
A	where you have to fuel
B	like sometimes would you not have to fly to Australia
A	yeah
B	and then on?
A	yeah
B	Cos there's too
A	I think that's it
B	all the way round
A	to New York
B	oh my God
A	horrendous
B	that's ridiculous
A	so it's gonna take
B	Cos when my friend
A	uh
B	lived in New Zealand she tried all different routes
A	yeah
B	she did like Cape Town to New Zealand
A	yeah
B	like er
A	lA
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that way
A	and then er they do Hong Kong
B	yeah
A	and then so you go to Dubai Australia and then New Zealand
B	yeah
A	and that's er it's just such a bitch
B	yeah
A	so when I got on the flight from Dubai they were like this is the whatever to Melbourne
B	oh no
A	no no I'm going to New Zealand
B	yeah
A	you're just having a little hour off
B	let you off
A	yeah
B	let some people off here
A	the Dubai stop-over was the worst though
B	yeah
A	have you flown to Dubai?
B	no
A	A you look like you're flying into the water so that's pretty terrifying
B	yeah?
A	Cos obviously it's right on the edge
B	yeah
A	and maybe it's because there's so many tall buildings or because it's there's a desert there but there's air pockets
B	oh
A	and it did this three times on the descent
B	pulled up? Wow
A	ascended
B	yeah
A	everyone's crying at this stage
B	oh huh
A	and then tried again and the same thing happened
B	oh my God
A	like
B	yeah
A	they were actually usually better than that though
B	oh God
A	and then they're like yeah two hours and then back on the plane
B	oh my goodness
A	yeah
B	that's true
A	that's why you do it
B	yeah
A	tut
B	would you like save up and do things like buy yourself something from Tiffany's and you know?
A	I know
B	can you not stay in a hostel or something? I mean unless er
A	yeah
B	it's your birthday though so
A	but if you can get um single
B	tut single
A	er single room it'd be okay
B	yeah
A	so yeah definitely
B	yeah
A	it'd be worth having a look to see what is available
B	yeah
A	so I'll have to start looking soon
B	but I think actually it's funny because the flights I mean it's the same sort of time of year that I went last year
A	yeah
B	and like if you go over a weekend it's a lot cheaper
A	tut
B	than if you go
A	you said
B	like if you wanna go on the Monday to come back on the Friday it's there must be so many people er from who are doing that from London
A	yeah
B	you know
A	so you're better off doing like Wednesday Wednesday or something
B	yeah
A	mm
A	yeah
B	but it's so good
A	a bit of
B	it's really I'd love to go back
A	oh
A	given that
B	I know
A	got a master plan
B	irons in the fire
B	oh
A	I think the fact that
B	yeah
A	managers and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	who get to go for good reason
B	yeah
A	but tut it would be good to be able to go
B	just they're closing down on everything aren't they though
A	yeah I know
B	no travel and
A	yeah
B	oh no none of this
A	well they say that
B	I know
A	I think it's all for show because
B	I'd love to see like you know some of their expenses
A	really? No
B	but
A	car
B	well I just it's kind of better anyway in some respects like er
A	yeah
B	you know get to look around and potter round yourself
A	well do you know
B	yeah yeah
A	getting like travel
B	oh I know
A	you don't spend any money
B	well
A	so when she went out she took five hundred pounds in cash
B	yeah
