A	yeah
B	what the hell is that?
A	no
B	they've got TV's
A	yeah I know but it isn't real to you see it is it? Especially if you're not a walker
A	if you're not a walker and you don't you know you call everything a hill when there's just like a slope

B	well hopefully not
A	idiots
B	leave them alone
A	well
B	they could be driving quite sensibly
A	you can hear it
B	well because it's a motorbike and it's got an engine
A	well it sounds like they're just revving it
B	it does sound like he's revving it actually
A	well as long as it doesn't the sound doesn't come this way because I'll be jumping in the bushes

A	oh wasn't there a little slip?
B	no
A	wasn't there a erm a no
B	no no that
A	really?
B	that one's just sitting in the middle of the woods like some spooky thing
A	well I don't know then
B	yeah
A	you know it it's just annoying when you get one big long road and there's no footpaths to cut across it
B	yeah
A	and you have to walk this road
B	there's lots of roads to explore
A	well I always say that there's nowhere to visit
B	but there's not many places to go and see to be honest is there? Is is a bit baron around here
A	no it's not
B	no it's lovely
A	you can't say that it's baron
B	no but there's lots of empty fields
A	well they're waiting for their crops
B	yeah well I mean
A	it's not baron
B	you've got lots of nice birds
A	we're not that much into our drought although we are having that hosepipe ban
B	but it's not like walking in in the Peak District or something is it?
A	no
B	yeah okay wrong word
A	horsies
B	yeah
A	why?
B	huh?
A	they're nice
B	I like the big ones
A	racing one?
B	no with the big furry feet
A	oh yeah
B	they're really cool
A	yeah they are cool
B	yeah
A	mm
B	this is the place that used to sell the erm
A	the mobile
B	they had those log cabins didn't they?
A	oh yeah
B	but I can't see any now so
A	well I was looking at those
B	they didn't look very good
A	mum and dad like them
B	yeah but did you see the price? They were ridiculous
A	they must have sold them all
B	that's a nice house
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah those big great big chimneys
B	I love the chimneys around here
A	yeah that's a
B	yeah
A	why?
B	why do they have those around here? Because loads of houses have got those
A	I don't know
B	is that? Some of them I've never really noticed before
A	I've well I've never really noticed
B	I've noticed around here but I've never noticed anywhere else
A	I don't think it's particular to here
B	yeah they must have been built in the same kind of period
A	mm
B	yeah
A	beautiful
B	trouble is with all those houses
A	no but I mean that's got a lot of windows compared to a lot of them
B	yeah
A	apart from on the end
B	it is nice
A	now this road here
B	no that's the one that says it leads to the chapel
A	oh
B	you can see it through the trees but there's no road
A	I'm sure there was a different one
B	it's like a secret church
A	does it belong to somebody?
B	it must belong to someone
A	it must be in their land or something
B	I don't know
A	I'm sure there was supposed to be a footpath
B	it would be like some Hammer Horror thing
A	I mean this is
B	well wait
A	yeah
B	it looks like it's following a road
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so anyway
B	I don't know
A	you can't have one here
B	I know
A	you could always
B	no I'm not paying that for a cigarette
A	well they don't have those machines anymore do they?
B	no
A	yeah
B	third day is the worst day is it?
A	yeah you'll be alright in a minute
B	right well it would be silly to start again
A	it's just stupid
B	we do it every time
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah it is torturing yourself basically
B	beware of the dog
A	yeah that's that one that that
B	and the gates open
A	yeah I'm walking the other side of you
B	you have to pick up a rock round here don't you?
A	yeah well this is why
B	watch out there's a car coming
A	this is why oh
B	yeah
A	well
B	who's that?
A	who's that?
B	oh it's
A	hello
