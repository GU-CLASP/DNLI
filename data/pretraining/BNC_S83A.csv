C	erm he's not Tom's not a teenager
A	is she an older teenager?

A	last year of primary
B	of primary school
A	oh right so he's eleven then
B	or first year in
A	uhu
A	not now but what were you saying
B	well I was saying that when there when boys go through an awkward stage
A	mm
B	then they start getting I've forgotten what they're called now pimples
A	oh oh well that happens to everybody
B	even you?
A	even me
C	have you got?
A	well I didn't really get them when I was a teenager
A	I've had them like on and off afterwards which is a diet thing so if I have chocolate or sweets like sugary things then I get them on my kind of chin and things like that but yes
C	so that's why you've got some on your cheek
B	well I
A	sorry? hang on
C	you've got I think I see some two spots on your cheek
A	I've got one there yeah
C	and one on your cheek
A	ah but erm
A	not everyone gets them
B	no
A	but you can get them some kids get them really bad which isn't a lot of fun yes boys look awkward when they first starting when they have hair growing on their face and it's sort of not enough hair to really shave but they need to sort of try and shave it that's a bit a bit tricky
C	I'm glad I'm
B	bit annoying as well
C	I'm glad I will never shave but
B	well you don't necessarily want to have you don't need to have a baby
A	no but you will have periods won't you
C	yeah
A	and that's a right pain literally
C	do you know what?
C	erm in The Boy with the
A	yes?
C	his mum and dad had him when they were teenagers
A	oh did they? yes well let's
C	yeah
A	let's try and avoid that happening to you two
A	that's still pretty young cos you probably won't have er gone through university
C	no
A	I was twenty-nine when I had you wasn't I?
B	how old are you now?
A	you know how old I am now
A	I'm thirty-nine
B	mm
A	so yeah you don't wanna leave it too late you don't want to really have kids in your thirties well to start having kids in your thirties if you're a girl but it doesn't really matter for a boy massively but you don't wanna be very old or very young
B	if you're very old then you'll be like a grandpa
A	and probably less fit and less likely to be able to run around and play with them and probably all die you know when they're relatively young but if you're very very young yourself I mean it can work I know some amazing parents who had kids when they were very young
B	like me in the future
A	what you want to do in life and that sort of thing but having said that sometimes having a baby focuses your mind you know? so
B	mm
A	but try and avoid having children in your teens
B	you said I'm gonna become a lovely husband and father
A	yes
B	so if I
A	ah but you can't have one when you're like fifteen because you won't have a job so how will you support your family?
B	I won't have it when I'm like fifteen
A	that's what I'm just saying don't have it when you're a teenager
C	erm I think I'm
A	yes
C	you get a half-life as a teenager
A	you get?
C	a half-life if as a teenager
A	a half-life as a teenager? what do you mean baby?

C	was
A	a half-life though?
C	so you get eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen that's it
A	as a teenager?
C	yeah that's it
A	it's just
C	about half
A	from thirteen
C	so thirteen
A	thirteen
C	fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen
A	eighteen
C	no the you told me those were grown-ups
A	yeah you're officially a grown-up at eighteen you can vote and all that kind of thing
B	and get your driving licence
C	mum
A	but you're still
C	when I'm when I'm
A	a teenager when you're nineteen
C	when I'm twenty-six that's when I'm grown up
A	well I haven't
B	well you won't

C	mum when?

A	so
A	but you will have to shave other things
C	yeah like your legs
A	say it properly
C	and
A	so some people do shave them
B	oh
A	and some people don't
B	that sounds painful
C	that's gonna hurt
A	well not if you're careful I mean it can hurt you know in Home Alone when
A	Kevin pretends to shave and then puts the aftershave on on his face and goes ah cos it stings because you've sort of shaved it so you can cut yourself
B	yeah
A	when you shave because whatever wherever you shave
A	and he does it twice doesn't he? that is such a good film
B	yeah he's like
A	so have you decided on the quality of your cupcakes are they good?

C	yeah because
A	we mm?

C	erm we only put a bit of er erm
C	you
A	mm
C	just get this lovely
A	it's subtle do you think?

C	yeah so
A	yeah
B	mm it's
C	when you er so when you so when you actually
A	mm
C	it mm instead of being like nice and runny it'll be so runny that erm it will turn into like a flop sided cake
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah you don't want it so runny the mixture
B	yeah that you when you
A	that you can sort of pour it in
B	yeah that when you lift it up you go yeah it's flop
A	you you can get recipes that have
A	very very very liquidy mixtures but they're very dense cakes they're not light and fluffy at all
C	that's horrible
A	yeah it's not very nice
B	I love light and fluffy cakes that's the only cake that
A	you like fluffy?
B	tastes good
C	cos
A	no
C	and when I bite into this the outside are a little crispy and that's what makes it good

B	it's the er the one on television
A	and do they sound English or American? are they speaking in an English accent or an American accent?
B	erm I think it's English but it might just be the person who's erm doing the voice of Dennis
A	mm

C	yeah there's one who says like this
C	Dennis hand me your cards now
B	no not like that

A	is she Scottish?
B	no idea
A	I always thought Dennis was Scottish I don't know why
C	and his parents
B	that's er crazy
A	so how did the juggling go today?
B	mm pretty good I probably juggled about let's see five or six times at a maximum five or six
A	but you did juggle with three successfully three balls?
B	yeah
A	yeah and I saw you trying the clubs as well
B	yeah I tried to juggle with two clubs but it just hurts
A	I think you just need to practise with one because the
C	what clubs?
A	the plastic
C	oh yeah
A	things where they're sort of wider at one end than the other
B	yeah but they are they are the
A	they're very tricky aren't they?
B	they were the hardest things to juggle
C	there are three things which are the hardest things to juggle knifes
A	right
B	knives
C	fire sticks
A	yeah
C	and hoops because hoops
B	no clubs
A	clubs
B	they're
C	yeah and hoops because
A	clubs
C	I always think hoops because
A	oh the little rings you mean? oh okay
B	I juggled with two of them
A	okay
C	because you could
B	I juggled with two of them
C	no because if you juggle with more of them you could cut your finger so
B	no they're made of plastic
A	I don't yeah I think you would with knives but not with not with little rings
B	well you can kill yourself if you juggle knives
A	I know
B	so you've got to be pretty and
C	and fire
A	you've gotta be pretty confident yeah
B	yeah
A	and fire
B	and fire you go da da-da da-da
C	remember the remember the
A	guy in Circus Wonderland?
A	what was he doing?
C	he was riding on a motor
B	not a motorcycling
C	a unicycle
C	and he was juggling three knives and he was riding er a six-foot tall
A	yes I know
B	that is pretty good multitasking
A	it is good multitasking but with at least with fire you can protect yourself you can coat your skin with something that protects you a little bit whereas knives you don't get any protection but yes the
B	wear damp clothes
C	you do get protection
A	that's not gonna
B	no from
C	not
B	fire
A	yeah but I was just saying that you can protect yourself against fire but not really so much
C	you can protect your
A	you can't protect yourselves from knives is what I'm saying
C	I said knife knives because it
A	you can't because your hands have got to be free haven't they? they've got to be out of the glove so yes you could protect your chest but it's not really your chest that's gonna get hurt is it?
B	okay
A	sorry?
C	it's your head
A	your face? oh I think you would be very unlikely to get them near your face if you were if you were already a very good juggler but clubs
C	yeah they juggled with like
B	yeah
C	six things
B	but the person who was juggling the clubs was the best
A	was he the guy with black hair?
B	er yeah
C	oh mum?
B	the juggling like was it five or four?
A	okay
B	and cos I saw him having a go at the hoops and he was really really good
A	excellent
C	and mum?
A	yeah?
C	there it wasn't
A	mm?
C	and he was doing all
A	amazing
C	and it was so good
A	very impressive indeed it's er I love the fact that when all the aerial stuff is going on in the church hall or in the church they're all just doing
A	doing their own thing and there's so much to see isn't there? but they're working very hard they do that every Sunday it was so quiet today though wasn't it? there was hardly anybody there
B	apart from the music
A	no but I mean there were very few people weren't there?
B	yeah
A	there were only I think six of us
B	is that including me and
A	no but
B	what is strength and conditioning?
A	so strength is when you're making your body stronger like doing push-ups and things like that and conditioning is when you are stretching your muscles to give you greater flexibility
C	mum
