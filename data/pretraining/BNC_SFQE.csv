C	I'll just drop the dice in your face
A	if we keep saying
D	yeah you did
A	hoity-toity I bet it'll end up as a really popular word
C	hoity-toity hoity-toity
D	er
C	hoity-toity
D	I'm not sure about that
A	no that's cheating
A	erm stop throwing the dice around please
B	that was
D	right
A	for weeks
C	he's not very good at it
A	what how are we doing in theory of knowledge? what do we
D	fine
A	now know?
B	theorising
D	nothing
B	knowledge?
D	mm
A	well what have you done? so you've been doing it for half a term now like what
D	yeah
A	on earth have you done?
D	well
B	bugger all
D	mm
A	well what happens in the sessions?
D	there was some watching videos and stuff
A	about what?
C	and erm having
D	like mm
C	mm
D	there was stuff about colour perception
C	oh shut up
C	I do but I can tell the difference between red and blue
A	okay
D	er
A	what so that's a good point right
D	stuff like that
A	so when
C	how many hours a week do you do this?
D	what gives words meaning
C	hello
D	we started doing the more complicated
B	hello
D	logic stuff and it turns out the teacher doesn't understand it and completely failed
A	great
A	so hang on a minute the colour perception cos that's gonna be
C	no it's not
A	knows it's black
D	mm
A	so I guess that it's
B	well
A	quite a good
B	cos it's
A	of like how
B	well
A	we know whether
B	but it's
A	or not we know
C	yeah it's
B	yeah
C	in the
D	do you know the Monty Hall problem?
C	genes and
A	Monty Hall?
D	yeah
A	no
D	erm so
D	when you've got three doors and there's two goats and a car
A	right
B	interesting
A	oh that if you open the first one
C	oh
D	yes that one
C	I know what you mean
B	what
D	yeah our teacher gave us the wrong answer to that
B	like what is that sorry?
D	you're supposed to choose another door
A	explain it to
D	yeah er
B	oh yeah
D	well
B	oh yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah I
D	yeah yeah our
D	teacher said that that's
C	wait how does how does it
D	so there's three doors
A	can I have your leftover food?
D	er there's a goat behind two of them and a car behind one of them
C	yeah
D	you choose one then someone opens another door and it has a goat behind it should you
C	yeah because then you've got a fifty-fifty chance right
A	mm
D	er
B	but you have
D	actually it's a two-thirds chance
B	if you change
C	is it?
D	mm
B	yeah
A	so I so you
B	but
D	what you're effectively doing is choosing both the goat the both your already opened door and the car one
A	hang on a minute
D	and the other one
A	can we just start
D	and taking whichever one's
A	hang on a minute can we just start again? so I've got a door
A	A B and C
D	yeah
A	and there are there behind them there's two goats and a car and
D	yes
A	we're assuming you want the car
D	yeah
A	so in my head I'm going to choose door A
D	you say you choose
A	okay I choose door A
D	yeah and then
A	does it get opened?
D	someone else opens say
B	door
D	door B and there's a goat behind it
A	okay
D	should you switch?
A	so
B	to door C
A	and I know that the truth is you should
D	yes
A	so when I've made my first decision there was a one in three
D	yeah
A	chance
B	yes
D	so what you're gonna effectively do now is choose both the other doors and take whichever one is right
A	how can I do that?
D	well if you
A	C?
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	then you er it's like a way of imagining it it just if you swap to the other one then there's a chance that the car we can I dunno I don't know how to explain it better than you can effectively choose the other two
D	yeah
B	mm
A	let's go and we know
D	well no we can't disregard door B
A	ah
D	cos there's still three doors
B	mm
C	yeah and you just know that
D	we just know that one of them has the goat behind it
A	and so we've got two remaining doors
B	one with a goat
A	and a fifty-fifty chance of one having a goat of of er of either of them having the car?
D	yes
A	so why does me changing my mind
D	well er it's definitely better than the first one because that was a one-third chance
A	yes so I so I'm
B	well
A	already down to fifty-fifty
D	yeah but
A	so why
D	I think it's also two-thirds I can't in fact remember
C	oh great
A	but your
B	but if it's
A	teacher had this wrong
D	yeah
C	what did he say? or she
D	he said that that's like an illusion and you're supposed to it doesn't
C	well
D	do any way
B	I it I er
D	and he also backed this up with some really rubbish statistics where basically
A	mm
D	we did it three times
A	mm
D	and did it four times sorry and we got a fifty percent chance of getting the car but the person who was doing it didn't always switch or stay
A	right so that you're and so the you weren't doing the same
D	yeah
A	thing over so you can
C	that's just bloody stupid isn't it?
D	yes it is
A	so
D	yes
A	and how did you do that?
D	one of the people in our class did a good explanation of it
A	erm and convinced the teacher?
D	yeah
C	really?
D	mm he had materials to do the problem
A	well and actually he had got the answer wrong?
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	is that because he was like you know your other teacher
D	he's not that young
B	what age is he?
C	neither are you
D	I dunno
D	yeah
A	that and that's reasonably unusual as well how many people are in your
D	er
D	like eighteen maybe?
A	oh so quite a lot then
C	mm
B	would you like to finish mine?
A	no I'm just finishing off
A	besides I'm supposed to stop finishing off everybody's food now I've come back from
A	no it's really very nice I can't understand how they
C	yeah I know I can't believe that one person could eat it I mean it's disgusting
A	oh
C	well it's not very
B	surely he has more
C	why not?
D	you were only using a recipe
C	yeah
A	well I suppose
D	mm
A	that's what they say you know that kind of contributing to the process
D	I'm not quite sure about that
C	if you do like it then it's nicer if you've made it but if you
A	okay
C	if it tastes horrible then it's just you know horrible
A	but it's not horrible oh maybe the problem is
D	if you make it you have
A	you're not having sour cream with yours
D	if you make it
C	just
D	you have some control
C	not very nice
D	over it and you can get rid of the worst bits
A	what the so the sour cream bits yeah?
D	yeah
C	yeah mm
C	yeah I just got one from the garden
A	yeah and I said oh you
C	could be
A	there's some things
C	I dunno
A	yeah
A	the meat in yours was really nice
B	yeah the meat was but it all in all
A	no I don't think when we get these cos they always tend to be a bit posh the recipes er I think you tend to not you know you're like a bit of a one meal though you don't tend to like the whole
D	if
D	yeah
A	putting it in square brackets rolls dice drops dice has dice flung at him by mother that kind of thing
B	and an or
B	has
A	in
C	you mean after you abandoned me in an unknown place?
A	no I I
A	gave you a map to walk to the train station with which you complete disregarded
C	you drew a map
C	which was utterly shit
B	it wasn't
A	it wasn't
B	and I have the
D	do you still have the map?
C	yes it's in the kitchen I think
D	right
A	it's just but it's perfect er yeah I I said to the others that I'd get a map of
D	you
A	something and it was annoying so I hit him over the head with a roll of newspaper and he stopped
C	mm
D	temporarily
C	oh you're a genius mum
A	yeah it was you know and it was also remarkably satisfying
A	but then not very long afterwards erm
C	I reckon you
D	that's really gonna confuse them
B	what this?
A	yeah
A	well I think that was a
C	mm
A	and tomorrow you're back to daddy's
C	right
B	erm
A	er

D	people use defenestrate for uninstall Windows
B	well fenestrate or
D	er internet would be that will be un-Windowed soon
A	that yeah that would be uninstalled what like throwing them out a window which I guess it might be how you'd go about getting rid of a window like if it was an upstairs window you'd like
D	as in computer Windows
A	oh I see sorry
D	yeah doh
D	oh my god
A	I'm not
D	neither do we
C	use the word uninstall
A	well yeah you install windows like you know
D	true
C	yeah well
A	it's like these words did exist prior to computing you know
B	I wish I could defenestrate or uninstall windows out of the window
A	you
B	yeah it would be fun I mean like
A	so erm but that's still
C	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	no so it's kind of still
C	yeah it's like the
A	kind of sweet I was like in my twenties before I first came across that word
B	defenestrate?
A	mm
B	I'm gonna the exact dictionary definition
A	what is the exact dictionary definition?
B	the act of throwing someone or something out of a window
A	very good
C	which
A	yeah
D	yeah look it up that's not the exact dictionary definition
A	well I bet they're the well it sounds like they could be
C	there is no exact dictionary definition in which case
A	I bet they
C	what are you looking in?
A	that's probably an an exact
B	in David
A	David Eddings?
B	and
C	really?
B	yeah in three different
C	he wrote the Lord of the Rings rip-offs
A	oh there's
D	I'm not quite sure about
A	The Belgariad
D	that but
B	The Belgariad and Malloreon erm
A	well they use the word defenestrate?
B	yeah three times
C	three times
A	and this is talking about
A	windows or computers?
B	oh yeah mm
C	I've never read them are they any good?
B	they're really good but you don't like
A	they might
B	then they do
A	predate Lord of the Rings
D	mm when you reread them it turns out they're not actually that good
C	no
A	well daddy used to say they were brilliant
D	most if it's ripped off out
A	but
C	well Lord of the Rings
D	I dunno and like Game of Thrones I mean it wasn't written for another twenty years
A	they are quite it might be he
D	but he sometimes
C	getting
B	like
A	mm
B	what kind of books like
D	there is no normal way in
B	oh yeah good point
D	the city on the mountain
B	that one
D	also there's
D	mm there's
B	that would be
D	there's
B	an interesting one for the record
D	no one agrees how many people it takes to summon a ghost
A	well there you go that's a complete narrative glitch
A	erm
C	mm?
A	mm was talking about how
A	rather than doing like personality tests and stuff they can tell so much about people from their erm er Facebook likes and stuff just
C	uhu
A	really quite unbelievable actually that
B	with three hundreds likes
A	mm
B	sorry they er can more accurately tell what you'll do than your
A	yeah but with ten likes they can more accurately predict what you'll do than your work colleagues with ten
B	mm
D	anyway erm
A	and hang on no I no I'm trying to tell you something and the other thing at this thing
B	anyway
A	they said with four credit card transactions they could identify you did you get that that? that
D	I think it was four pieces of data surrounding a credit card transaction
A	okay that they would literally be able to find you
D	yeah
A	not
D	yeah
A	this is somebody who's shopping
D	they'd be able to find
D	your house
A	not from the
D	no your name
A	if
D	erm your from your name probably your house
A	so who the the
D	yeah
A	also some
D	that's all
A	or whatever
C	but what if the four things were milk eggs butter and bread?
D	yeah I'm not sure it's four things they bought it's stuff like
A	the time that you bought the milk?
D	yeah
A	is that what you mean?
D	or
A	where you bought the milk
D	the last four digits of your credit card number they'll be
A	oh no I don't think it was that sort of identifier
A	I don't think it was they could find you online I think it was that yeah er you know somebody buy
D	yeah
A	if the person buys milk
D	the
A	at night
D	yeah
D	they take a set of data and compare it with other databases and see where it overlaps
A	mm
C	yeah but anyone can do that if they had all the data
D	well the point is
C	you need the data to do like all the data
D	we do have all the data most of this
A	yeah
D	is an open database this
C	oh you're right the yeah the supermarket
A	yeah
D	doesn't doesn't it
A	so and they also have these two lists of like things that basically clever people are interested in and
A	things that stupid people are interested in
D	in terms of IQ
A	in terms of IQ yeah so similar so Mozart was
D	mm
A	erm on the clever people one and erm The Godfather which is actually a series of films that I've never seen but I've been meaning to
C	apparently whenever an orange appears in The Godfather someone's about to die
A	is that right? we have we should look in Amazon Prime what what the fuck it is we've got and see
B	yeah Amazon film
A	if we can anyway so and also bizarrely thunderstorms
D	what about them?
A	clever people like
D	what like what were some of them?
A	er well I
B	well I didn't know who either the first two were names which I didn't recognise
C	you're useless
B	five days and
C	yeah it's cos you're unaware of like what happens around you
A	five days
B	ten days and nine quid each
C	whatever
A	what are you saying?
C	he's working out
A	oh
C	he's thinking about the money
B	I am I'm thinking of you
A	it er if you do that then the person won't be able to hear you bloody idiot
C	bloody bloody
A	right
B	bloody
A	erm yes
C	cool
B	at ten past
C	yeah great I can't wait to watch that
A	and hopefully you'll like he'll join in and not be a miserable git
B	I think it's quarter to eight so
A	is it already quarter to eight?
B	yeah
A	see what you mean
C	yeah well it's just
A	an hour and half
C	lying
A	no it's just because er you are actually genuinely slower than a grown up would be at cooking
C	I don't see how I can be slower
A	forever to chop it's unbelievable how slowly you chop things
C	mm
A	it's just like
A	I guess
C	yeah
A	I remember when you did macaroni cheese once years ago and it was just the grating the cheese
C	I do chop oh yeah
A	yeah grating the cheese went on and on
B	yeah I remember that
D	okay cool
A	excellent alright let me stop this recording
A	yeah
