A	and you could do stuff like add extra ice to the Coke
B	oh right it's like a management game innit
A	so you had people come into like your your fairground and then if the rides were like if you didn't mend the rides then they would get like injured and get unhappy

A	or if you're like
A	I liked all that sort of thing
B	just like real life
A	yeah
B	if you closed it for like refurbishment for like all summer or something a lot of people would drive there like they do at the end of that that wonderful film uh National Lampoon's Vacation

B	they from I think they live in Chicago
A	yeah
B	to uh Los Angeles uh a fictional um theme park in California called Wally World

A	because America have like a brand like um uh theme parks that are called Six Flags
B	oh right
A	and I went to Six Flags Over Texas
B	oh right
A	theme park
B	no I think Wally World is definitely definitely a Disney copy

B	uh like a a giant moose um which uh which um Chevy Chase punches punches in the nose
A	I don't understand why
B	well

A	oh yeah Chariots Of Fire
B	from um Chariots of Fire
A	yeah
B	it says Sorry guys we're closed for refurbishment for three months or something and
A	it's stupid
B	and actually they they forced John Candy turns up and they forced John Candy to to take them At gunpoint actually
A	weird

B	um
B	what's the plot of that? Is it it it's a guy like she she thinks she's better than the guy or something?
A	no uh so
B	doesn't he? He
A	well it's a like a girl who's from like a small town girl who's ended up living in New York and like become like a sort of socialite um slash sort of um
B	hold on
A	breakfast At Tiffany's
B	oh right
A	but then like a guy moves in next door and um sort of falls in love with her and
B	I didn't realize it was
A	but she's sort of
B	yeah he does that speech
A	and then she sort of says oh I'm I'm nobody I don't need anyone and then like she puts the cat out
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah and gets the cat and he chases doesn't he?
A	and like they both like
B	doesn't he? He finds the cat and like carries it
A	they both  they both  do at the end and then  and then  he
B	is that a shop?
A	yeah it's a
B	oh right
A	oh right Tiffany's
B	I I don't know suppose I don't know much about jewellery really
A	yeah it's a really famous jewellery sort of um like jeweller
B	is that in New York yeah?
A	they've got a big shop in New York I don't know if
B	Cos Breakfast At Tiffany's set in New York isn't it?
A	yeah it is yeah
B	so they don't really  they don't really  have breakfast at Tiffany's in the film?
A	he's a wet
B	oh
A	but they go on this date and he he's won like a  he's won like a  ring like in a cracker or some some sort of biscuity cake thing
A	and he gets it engraved at Tiffany's for her
B	could've gone somewhere cheaper but yeah
A	well they go on date where they do things that they haven't done before like that neither of them have done
B	oh right
A	well he's a writer but he hasn't been able to write for
B	what's his  what's his  book about?
A	I can't remember
B	yeah
A	but uh it is a nice film but it's not your sort of film I don't think
B	well it's okay  it's okay  the film
A	it's a bit like that one
B	sounds alright
A	no
B	they're on a boat
A	so it's set
B	is it is that The
A	african Queen
B	um
A	Rex Harrison?
B	Burt um
A	that's right
B	and with uh Dirk um not Dirk Bogarde uh the a um the American guy
A	I know but I can't think of his name
B	it's uh um
A	Humphrey Bogart that's right
B	and and they were big they're big drinkers John Huston and Humphrey Bogart
A	not in the film though
B	and they they didn't drink any water when they were filming it
A	yeah
B	and that's and the that kept them off cos
A	she got ill yeah
B	um but they and they they never
A	well
B	she was a bit a hell of a diva yeah
A	what? Oh the communist place?
B	uh anti un-American uh actors
A	that's weird isn't it?
B	uh they made a blacklist
A	D'you think she was though?
B	um
A	that doesn't mean anything
B	probably unlikely that she would want to take money from wealthy families since she herself was from a wealthy family
A	yeah
B	I think they went a little bit over the top with the McCarthyism maybe but of course that was the height of the you know Cold War so
A	yeah
B	obviously America was kind of scared that uh
A	well there's a new programme on isn't there called Homeland
B	homeland Department of Homeland Security of whatever it's called?
A	yeah looks good
B	they're they're like the coast guard and the sort of
A	but the Department of Homeland Security that's surely that's like the
B	uh is it similar to our MI5?
A	yeah I think so
B	internal um internal intelligence whatever
A	so is MI6?
B	not sure
A	I don't know
B	watched Scarface yesterday
A	homeland Security actually it is because that's I remember they stamped my passport when I went to New York
B	homeland Security?
A	department of Homeland Security thing with a big eagle boof saying I was allowed in
B	yeah
A	but they were really
A	hand yeah
B	talon and uh symbolizing power and uh an olive branch
A	ah
A	in the other talon symbolizing
A	peace
B	the opposite of the arrows yeah um
A	mm
B	yeah they're really yeah you said
A	they weren't just like How you doing? They weren't they were like What is the purpose of you visit? Like really angry and sort of uh like scary really
B	yeah it's all it's really cracked up cranked up after nine eleven hasn't it but um
A	I don't really mind though I think like
B	they they might have like
A	like they can scan all me baggage and all of me organs or whatever they wanna scan really I don't really mind
B	yeah no I I don't really uh
A	if they wanna frisk us if they wanna
B	I don't mind that either I mean
A	but I think like even the whole sort of you know people don't like the whole body scanning thing
B	like it's I think it's going to happen like
A	well it's enforced in some places isn't it I mean?
B	I think it's it's it's just it's a logical sort of progression of um of uh technology and security you know
A	I don't care like
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean me too
A	I haven't got a problem with it
B	yeah I'd rather have the scanning than the danger of like
A	yeah
B	terrorism on on the plane and uh
A	it is yeah
B	bit like uh immigration or uh the the EU uh
A	yeah
B	yeah
