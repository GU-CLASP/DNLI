A	don't know but erm
C	well if you've built
B	yeah
C	you know yes it gets low that's why you get things and was I reading something about it's you get colds because of there's a decrease or increase in temperature in your nostrils
B	oh right
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
C	and that lets things come in more than other things
B	yeah
C	so at certain temperature
A	he's had a cold nose lately
A	I said to you hadn't I there's quite a few
B	nice hey dogs have cold noses

C	it was thirty-five pints
B	yeah that was a really good dark beer done there
C	they seem they seem to have got it right for the home brewery markets
B	they have yeah
C	well the weather doesn't know what to do does it?
B	no it's been raining it's been sleeting and it's been snowing and it's been freezing and there's no sort of
C	yeah it's slightly up
B	about three or four
C	three degrees
B	three degrees
C	well that's what it said on the car three degrees
B	yeah
C	I found
C	and I worked out what it was it was the cruise control
B	oh right
C	but the cruise control on this is not the same as the
B	do you?
C	there's a little button here you press
B	yeah
C	and then there's a little dial that you just move up and down to either increase or decrease
B	the speed
C	the speed
B	yeah
C	amazing erm
B	oh great
C	erm
C	it's dropped which is interesting
B	yeah
C	we'll see
C	still no news on the engine
B	well you've got this one for a little while
C	yeah it's gotta be built
B	the engine has gotta be built?
C	so it's gonna be a brand new engine coming from Germany
B	crikey
C	but it's not built so they've got to build it from scratch
B	well one-off
C	no there's not one of the shelf there's not one on back order at all
B	wow
C	supposedly supposedly
B	well that's a bit remiss of them isn't it?
C	so
B	crikey
C	well it's it's not a new model is it? that's the thing
B	well it's ten years old isn't it?
C	no they're only supposed to keep twelve years of
B	yeah
C	parts for any for any car they have to have twelve years of parts but if it's an engine
B	yeah
C	well they'll have all the bits won't they
B	they'll have all the bits
C	just got to just got to assemble it
B	put it all together yeah yeah
C	well it's just just the thought of it
B	yeah that's what I was thinking here
C	just the thought of building
B	yeah
C	I'd rather it be I think it's called a an N four three will it be an N something that they're putting in them now?
B	oh I see yeah
C	yeah yeah so
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	so
B	well
A	oh
B	you would have thought they would have said to you well you better have another car
C	well I was I was
A	yeah
C	actually looking at the website last night
A	oh
C	and the you know my my car they would sell my car at twelve at twelve and half thousand
B	yeah
C	that's what they'd sell my car at
B	yeah
C	they would probably give me ten for mine
B	yeah
C	so they got that little bit of leeway
B	yeah
A	right
C	well it's costing them more than
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	you know why don't they just give me another car
B	yeah
C	and then they can put the engine in when they need to
A	yeah
C	and then there's no expense on the at a hire car they've got to pay or
B	that's right
A	yeah
C	anything like that
A	have you suggested it?
C	no no
A	you daren't
C	no because the problem with my car my car is is special my car is special
C	but my car is a model that they haven't got if you know what I mean
B	yeah
C	because the spec that's on my car
A	right
C	isn't the same spec as the cars that they've got in because they have so many different specs
A	right
B	they do don't they yeah
C	it's unbelievable
A	it's quite special then?
C	well I think whoever had it put those extra bits on
A	right
C	which are extra for that car so the other cars might have something different but don't have the same spec as
A	yeah
C	you know I looked last night and one same
B	oh right yeah
C	the same erm model
A	mm
C	and year but that one had got satellite nav in where mine hasn't
C	but it hasn't got cruise control
B	oh
C	or it hasn't got the phone
A	mm
B	oh right
C	the Bluetooth interaction and little things like that
A	mm
C	I mean it doesn't it doesn't have the spaceship lights that come on
A	yeah
C	all these things this one does you know
B	yeah
C	so this this car is
B	is it? yeah
A	yeah
C	what I'd really like to do is take my car this car on a nice long journey somewhere
B	mm
C	that's what I'd really like to do
B	yeah
A	mm
C	they're saying about a month
A	oh
B	wow
A	wow
B	well that's Germans for you they
C	yeah it's good it's good so
B	what's it called? German engineering? yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I mean I mean I mean this one has seated rear seated front seats
C	they are nice I have to admit they are nice she got in after a hard day riding yesterday
A	yeah
C	she took of her she's got leggings on underneath her jodhpurs to keep warm so she took her jodhpurs off because they were a bit wet
B	yeah
C	and she put her seat on and oh this is nice
C	so that was that was good
B	well it's great
A	yeah
C	I've got I've got a little problem with my heating at home
B	have you got an air lock?
C	I don't know the radiator's not giving not not all the radiators some of the radiators are getting really hot and others
B	yeah
C	so what I did was I turned them all off yesterday and then turned them back on again
B	have you got the the what do you call it the thermostat valve?
C	yeah
B	right undo the top
C	yeah
B	a with a pair of pliers pull that little pin up
C	why?
B	because that little pin gets stuck down
C	right okay
B	and then that ours is the same you know
C	right okay that could be the
B	yeah yeah
A	oh
B	well I think that might be what it is yeah you know the thermostat
B	yeah
C	and some have been closed down and they're not opening or they're just opening a little bit so
B	yeah that's it yeah
C	they're not getting the full thing
B	that took some pulling up though
C	and I got
B	is it? yeah crikey
C	it's now gone and I'm now using wood that's in wood that I put in the coal bunker
B	oh right
C	and I think probably next weekend I will probably be burning coal in it
B	yeah yeah
C	use that and get that all emptied out
B	well it's been cold but it's been damp with it that's what that's what's the awful bit
C	yeah it just doesn't move it
B	no it's horrible
A	yeah
C	so have you made your bird feeder yet?
B	no not yet no not anything I've just been too knackered to do anything to be honest with you
A	you did open it and
B	yeah
A	been reading the shed book haven't you?
B	yes I've been reading the shed book that's funny
A	yeah we've been doing little bits that we probably wouldn't do
B	yeah
A	we did a puzzle
C	have you finished it?
A	it's very difficult let me show you I've got lots of bits but it's all too many of them together really
C	well I did a few little jobs around the house yesterday
B	yeah
A	I have all these bits of kind of joined
A	I can't fit them anywhere
C	oh that's good one that is
B	it is a good one
A	it is
B	she spent most of her time on that
A	I spend a lot of time I've got another tray of bits you know but these are all bit joined
C	well at least at least you've got the frame there to work within
B	yeah
A	well you did the outside didn't you?
B	yeah I did a little bit
A	yeah but it's so complicated
B	well that's because it's supposed to be
A	cos they're not they're not straightforward they're all kind of screwed up sort of thing
C	yeah it's a clever puzzle
A	very good
C	it's a clever puzzle
A	yeah
C	no I've got some drawer handles which were going so when you pull them they're not twisted
B	oh yeah
C	and you couldn't do them any more
B	no
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so and then so on the one drawer unit I had to take all the stuff out of the drawer take the four screws out of the back
B	yeah
C	to get to the
B	yeah
C	to have a look and see what I did so I just put a bigger screw in basically
B	yeah

B	yeah
A	okay
B	yeah we thought it might be our
A	do you think I need to turn it off more?
B	internet

B	oh right
A	okay
C	so just

C	not on those
B	not on them
C	yeah but you you got your cache is as low as you can
B	mm
A	mm
C	it all depends on your RAM et cetera

B	put or even put it on Youtube because I'm sure that would get
C	lots of hits
B	that would get loads of hits it would
A	it would and she'd do the same sort of thing again it was just
B	she was just running around looking at things picking things up you know
A	and then sometimes
B	of course when she when she falls over or she can't get up without getting hold of something so she have to crawl towards something and then lift stand up
B	and that looks so funny don't it?

B	oh I see
C	I mean well that wasn't the best thing was it but neither of them came
B	oh I see
A	oh yeah
C	you know you're kind of thinking well
B	is she stirring it up
C	is she stirring it or is she trying to say something
B	make him jealous
C	make I'm thinking and then
B	oh dear
C	stuff like that and well you know he has he has that choice
B	yeah
C	of what he does and he's gone to this UTC and there are a different group of people at the UTC
B	yeah
C	because it's
A	mm
C	you know it is supposed to be a technical college
B	yeah
C	but I know some of the students that have gone there
B	yeah I suppose you would do yeah
C	you know and there are students who schools don't like in their schools
B	yeah
C	instead they got them out doing
A	yeah
C	you know and he's supposed to be doing engineering and everything
B	yeah
C	so but he he's always had he he I mean well he had calmed down but there was always that he was always polite I could never fault him he was always polite always thank you never
B	yeah
C	never a problem but there was a streak in him
B	yeah
C	you know you could tell there was a streak in him
B	yeah that remind me of that programme that used to be on the television where erm what was his name? little boy used to come in and
C	yeah
B	that was
A	mm
B	that was
C	that was brilliant
B	and you know the they do change they do they they do things like that but then when they're with their peers you know then they act like they do
C	yeah
B	just to be in with the gang
C	yeah and they try you know and show their
B	yeah
C	or they
B	that's it yeah
A	mm
C	it's just yeah
B	yeah but they they have to learn don't they?
C	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	I was the model teenager
A	doesn't sound like it
B	pardon?
A	doesn't sound like it
B	what do you mean it doesn't sound like it hey?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you tell us too much
C	we know the things you ought to tell us
C	mm
B	Sky News was it?
C	yeah well they had just published this thing about obesity and how it's dropped in the last couple
B	oh yeah
C	of years et cetera so they Sky News asked if they could come in
B	and film the kids?
C	and film
B	well of course it was yeah
C	you know
A	mm
C	and it was interesting because I heard I heard the
B	yeah
C	because we don't know what the consequences are gonna be because in the old regime it was if this happened they were in there for the day
B	yeah
C	type thing er
B	yeah
C	am I putting myself in the middle? but the message was from my line manager and another person was he said you need to email and see what she says so I emailed the boss and she came back to me because she wasn't in the academy and came back and went see me in the morning and we'll have a have a chat
B	oh right
C	so I went in one in the morning
A	oh
C	and just and we had this chat and she went right
B	oh right
C	a little girl
B	oh I see
C	erm
B	yeah
C	which was which was interesting and then I spoke to a member of staff later in the day and it was like I don't know who she thinks she is
C	well she's the principal she's the principal of this the academy she can do what she wants
B	yeah
C	be but the problem she's having
B	yeah
C	it is different to being principal or head in a federation because the federation has rules
B	yeah
C	of what we can and can't do where so if you need to do
B	yeah
C	but then that's a big stepping stone
B	yeah
C	because you've got to keep checking
A	yeah
C	and the
B	know
C	they're coming in
B	yeah
A	mm
C	so that they can say nay or yay to them
B	being filmed
C	being filmed or whatever
B	yeah
C	now we we have on record everybody's consent to say yes we can no we can't
B	yeah
C	but if you're a a student and it's like
B	well yeah
C	you know oh yeah I want to be on TV and you parents said no
B	you do it
C	you do it I mean I had a a problem when I was
B	yeah
C	and it was a whole school photo and he wanted he wanted to be in it
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and his parents said he couldn't and then he he asked me could you phone up and say what it is and I went yeah of course I can if that's what you want so I phoned up and they were like well what is it I said it's a whole school photo and he would like to be in it with all his
B	mates yeah
C	with all his mates and it was like oh what's it gonna be used for I says it's not going to be used for anything it's
B	yeah
C	it is a whole school photo
A	yeah
C	you know and the problem is knowing some of the parents they don't want the pictures taken because if their son or daughter does something wrong you've got an image of them saying who it is
B	yeah of course of course
C	and that and that's another little factor that comes into play
B	I think erm
B	I think
C	yeah
B	they don't show any faces or anything do they or if they're a little more away they're blur them it's a blur
C	yeah
B	it never used to be like that did it?
A	no
C	no it's just
B	I mean when when they that that seems ridiculous to me what what what's the difference between you know seeing kids playing in the playground and filming the kids playing in the playground?
C	because there are some kids that have been moved schools and they're in safe houses et cetera
A	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	and if their and if from whoever they're put in the safe house from sees them on TV
A	oh
C	they'll know where they are
B	yeah
C	and they go and hang outside
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	isn't it a shame how things have changed though?
A	yeah
B	and they decided that was fine at the end though
A	yeah
B	well we were we filmed our kids at the nativity
C	yeah I mean I think I think one person if I remember rightly on person in the school kicked up about it one person
B	yeah
C	and it was only one and because one person kicks up then because the way that headteacher was
B	yeah
C	no but in the then she actually I think she then some sort of guidance came out from the unions in little bits and pieces which says you know you make it clear that they can film it
B	yeah
C	but they're only filming their child or whatever it is
B	yeah
C	erm and if and if they don't and if the child can't be filmed then you don't put them in play
B	yeah that makes sense
C	why stop if for the majority
A	yeah
C	because of one person
B	yeah course I mean people are so proud of they're so proud of seeing their kids on stage doing their bit and then some idiot will say oh no not not
C	yeah
B	they spoil it for the entire crowd
C	that's what it comes down to
B	yeah yeah
C	that's what it literally comes down to
A	so was the reason that these parents didn't want their son being photographed?
C	well it was because he was always in trouble
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	he was always in trouble and there was one there was one case where we did actually manage to get a picture cos we hadn't got we hadn't got picture of a couple of students who'd done something
B	yeah
C	and we the head of PE did some filming intentionally
B	yeah
C	intentionally too and they got the picture and then of course we can't use them because we didn't have permission
B	oh right yeah
C	yeah little things like that we just have deal with so
B	yeah we do yeah
A	yeah
B	that's such a shame though
C	we just have to deal with
B	I mean parents some parents are
C	yeah some but we've I meant this week's been a it's a the hardest week again this week
B	has it?
C	oh yeah with
A	yeah
B	I suppose it becomes harder as the terms goes on doesn't it because they're thinking it will be half-term it will soon full-term or whatever
C	well last week we were told that we've got to deliver a different course for our uni's
B	oh right
C	right starting three weeks' time
B	and you've got to set the course out then?
C	yeah
B	in three weeks?
C	in three weeks so scheme of work project that you're gonna do
B	yeah
C	et cetera et cetera
A	mm
C	three weeks
B	oh
A	right
C	because we're thinking the timetable might change
B	well what about the curriculum? does that
C	it will affect it will affect
B	it will affect the whole curriculum
C	yeah it will affect it yeah but it will also affect all year nine students
B	yeah
C	because what they're gonna make them do is a DT subject
B	oh right
C	well not all students at year nine want to do a DT subject
B	no
C	they want to get out of it they don't want to do it
B	no
C	they've had enough of it
B	sure
C	but they're all gonna have to do it
B	oh I see yeah
A	mm
C	right
B	so there will be some disruption there
C	right so and because the new principal had used this course at her old school which was relatively successful
B	oh I see yeah
C	doesn't personally yes it's a it's a qualification point that has no meaning
B	no
C	but it gets you on the league table and gets the students
B	yes it's a bit
C	yes well the government stopped that you see
B	they stopped that did they?
C	yeah because what was happening when that came in you could have that once course for four then picked up another one and you've got your five GCSE's
B	five GSCE yeah
C	so you stand you
B	yeah
C	you was high in the standards you were in the top because that's how
B	yeah
C	and then the government got onto the back of that and went no you've got to have five GCSE's and including English and Maths
B	yes yeah yeah
C	so that would become the gold standards
B	you must you must get it in English and Maths
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so it's all kind of changed but you're thinking alright so we've got three weeks to do this course beginning of the week we were told we can't do it
B	oh
C	because it's already registered as a course for the arts
B	oh right
C	so this certificate number which you have this certificate number with craft or art or BT or whatever you're gonna run
B	yeah
C	but if you're already running you can't do it again the kids can't do the same thing
B	oh
C	so it's like yeah okay
A	yeah
C	and then so and we have a parent's evening this week and I thought it was on Thursday but it was on Wednesday
B	oh dear
C	because we had one last week which was on
B	yeah
C	the Thursday and I just thought it was a week later but they moved it to Wednesday
B	oh
C	which
B	did you?
C	so erm I have fifteen students and thirteen sets of parents come
B	that was good wasn't it?
C	brilliant turnout
B	yeah
C	and they were all happy they all wanted to see me which was really good
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	right because
B	that's right
C	and and I said one of the things that if we run the course that we're gonna run which is product design yes there is an element of food in there
B	yeah
C	like how to make a cardboard model
B	yeah
C	and artwork
B	yeah
C	when you when you look at it you just do an element which will have the food element
B	yeah
C	why it's the same with the electronics it's the same with the erm textiles it's the same with
B	yeah
C	with a small element you know if you've got to do it in we've got to do this one in just over eighteen months probably two years
C	and you can do it in a bit more so it's not
B	yeah
C	because not all the staff can teach all the
B	well that's another thing isn't it yeah you know
C	if you're fortunate enough to be able to teach all the elements that I can teach
B	yeah
A	mm
C	not not a problem
B	that's right yeah
C	but I mean what about someone who can't teach you know
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm and
B	yeah
C	if you've got a hundred and seventy-two kids doing product design as a GCSE in moderation
B	yeah
C	it would just be
B	well they don't
B	really?
C	I think they want to cut the budget
A	yeah
C	you know
A	mm
B	yeah that's a lot yet
C	I mean ten grand on food
A	that's a lot
B	that is a lot isn't it
C	you know that I mean that's all year seven eight and nine cooking and ten and eleven
B	don't they bring their own grub in?
C	no cos they would never bring it in
B	oh
C	or they would forget to bring it in and then you'd have problem because they can't cook because they haven't got the ingredients and they'd mess around and stuff like that
B	do they have to buy
C	no
B	it
A	well we used to
B	we used to have to buy it at the end?
C	yeah no
B	I mean when we did woodwork we used to have to buy what we did
C	we've started
B	pay for the wood that's it
C	we started yeah we've started charging for aspects of it
B	yeah
C	but because sixty-sixty to sixty-five percent of our students are pupil premium
B	yeah
C	we get the
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	now I heard I heard the principal say on
B	wow
C	because if you haven't got one we'll buy you one with your pupil
B	what?
C	and I'm thinking what pupil premium goes into the school designed for the staff pays for some of your staff
B	yeah
C	cos that's the way the bosses used it
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	it doesn't go to the students it brought staff on so you had more staff in areas
B	yeah
C	she's she's got a lot to sort out
A	yeah
B	let's hope she does it
C	she's got a lot to sort out
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	well does the money come from the educations committee or does it come from
C	comes from the federation doesn't it?
B	it comes from
C	because we're an academy
B	oh I see
C	so the government give you money for your establishment
A	oh yeah
C	right now when you've got X amount of schools within your federation
B	yeah
C	all that money goes into a pot and then it gets
B	shared out
C	shared out with erm I don't know
B	yeah
A	school equipment's more important really than buying coats and that
B	I always thought books and equipment
A	yeah
B	are education you know
A	mm
C	yeah we've got all these Ipads and everything
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and most of them have a tablet in some description
B	they do don't they all the kids have got phones now haven't they
C	you know but
B	smartphones
C	but the argument there is well they won't do it so if we give them something
B	oh I see
A	oh okay
C	where are we?
C	where are we? okay now I I think
B	have they blocked Facebook and all them sort of things?
C	well Facebook is supposed to be blocked in school
B	it is yeah
C	but if you've got a smartphone with internet connection
B	you you pay for it
C	so it don't make any difference does it?
B	no
C	if you've got a phone with internet access you can get it you can't you can't not
B	no
A	no
B	well that's difficult isn't it?
C	you know
A	yeah
C	so
B	there was a bit on er on the television the other day about trolls on Twitter and these people really mess other or try to mess other people's lives up
A	yeah
B	that's quite awful isn't it?
A	mm
B	wicked people on Twitter
A	mm
C	I mean the thing is the thing is you can I mean you can report it quite quickly and you can block it and you can do other things
B	but it's done once it's done
A	yeah
B	innit?
C	you can get and you can block it
B	yeah
C	but you know the thing it's one of those things if you put yourself out there then you're gonna have some
B	well you are aren't you
A	yeah
B	I mean erm I don't know whether you saw erm The Last Leg last night did you? oh it was funny
C	I'll have to download it
B	oh you'll have to look at that
C	cos I can download it
B	it's called The Last Leg
C	I'll get it downloaded
B	oh I think that that was brilliant
C	yeah
B	and the light on him
B	and he had to interview him and the stuff
B	they come out with oh
C	I'll download it
B	it is so funny
A	no
B	no
C	yeah I'll I'll download it cos did you see Restoration Man this week?
B	yeah we've got it recorded

B	was it? oh right well it was on this morning and they were doing up the boat
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm

C	well he gets stuck in
B	yeah I like Grand Designs too we we record Grand Designs  Restoration Man
A	erm we like those like the Small Spaces which
B	yeah Small Spaces

C	Sewing Bee starts this week as well
B	yes it does yeah we recorded it
A	yeah it hasn't started yet has it
B	we we have it we record them
C	yeah
B	but we haven't got erm what you got
C	series link
B	yeah we've had that donkey's ears now
A	we did think
B	we did think get getting that erm
B	yeah
C	yeah but you need a bigger broadband
B	well apparently you only need two two gigabytes they say
C	yeah yeah but all your programmes come in on broadband
B	oh right
C	so you'd have to have you'd have to have a
B	yeah
B	we're nearly over our limit this year
A	I don't know
B	aren't we? we're nearly over our limit now
A	yeah we are and we are every month
B	and what did you do? you went on Facebook and watched that little thing this morning
C	the
A	I haven't watched anything this morning
B	well yesterday then
C	yeah the problem is though because you're because you're Skyping and
B	yeah
C	you are gonna go over
B	yes
C	because you using that Droid you know
B	yeah Skype Skype does a lot
A	yeah I think we're gonna have to eventually
C	yeah you know from a I mean we're unlimited now because I don't have to worry about it because
A	yeah
C	that extra five pound which it which it was if you go over your limit
B	yeah
C	well that's what it is if you have unlimited
B	yeah yeah
A	we kept think well we'll pay the extra five pound whenever
C	yeah yeah
B	and every single email's a download
C	yeah well email is not that big but pictures but that band that you use when you are
B	yeah
C	watching stuff
B	yeah
C	is amazing
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	downloads and
C	anything you know if you're on if you're on your
A	yeah it would be nice just to not worry about it really
B	that would be nice yeah
C	well there's some good deals out and about with BT
A	yeah
B	well I don't think I have BT anyway just because there's there's a
A	yeah
C	but if you read all the small print if you go over your allowance and stuff like that it's more expensive
B	yeah yeah
C	so you might as well just go with BT or you know
B	yeah or Virgin or whatever
A	yeah
C	you know
A	erm
C	I think that's coming in BT
B	yeah
C	you know but if you want
B	yeah
C	because it was only seven days you could do seven days of capture but now it's
B	well that's good isn't it
C	so
A	mm
B	no I think we'll have to eventually anyway
C	yeah
B	we've had computer
A	sometimes
B	yeah
C	ten gig is nothing now
B	ten gig is nothing at all is it?
A	no we thought they might up it but they're not going to
C	no no they won't what they want is they want people to go unlimited then they haven't got to worry about
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	those things
B	yeah
C	so
B	well it is the best idea to go unlimited cos
A	oh yeah
B	really we worry about watching things that will
A	we do we don't tend to watch Youtube much
B	no
A	because
C	you know when you when you break it down
A	mm
C	you know
A	yeah
C	but you know you you Facetime and whatever and Skype that is hitting it big
B	yeah yeah
A	well Christmas we we thought we we assumed we were all fine you know
B	yeah
A	because we hadn't watched much getting ready for Christmas and stuff we hadn't done much and we were about six gigabytes weren't we?
B	yeah
A	and then they came for Christmas and then there went all the
B	they were all on everything aren't they?
A	these and erm erm what's his name
B	yeah he was playing a game yeah
A	which is why we were over
B	yeah
A	in a couple of days
B	yeah
A	they were only here a couple of days
B	yeah
A	mm not that we don't mind
C	but that but that you know sort of
A	but yeah if you've got a few people here it
C	it soon goes
B	and then there's there's the stuff that I like to watch like woodworking and all that stuff that sort of stuff and you like to watch your
A	yes there is some interesting stuff out there
B	yeah
A	you get sucked into other things don't you? you go on something
C	yeah
A	and think ooh that looks interesting
C	yeah
A	and get sucked into that even though you had no intention of watching it
B	but when you think of what what we've got now and what we had a few years ago you can learn anything now can't you you can learn anything
C	anything yeah
C	what's that?
A	erm an aeroplane
C	yes an aeroplane
B	they're put in the freezer section?
C	what? no that is a five megabyte hard drive
B	what they're putting in
B	woah
C	five megabytes
C	that's how big a five megabyte hard drive is
B	carry that on a forklift look a motorized forklift
A	yeah
C	right that's five megabytes
A	mm
C	you you're holding thirty-two megabytes in your hand
B	yeah yeah
C	sorry
B	gigabytes yeah
C	in your hand
C	and that's five megabytes
B	they show you the first computer
A	mm
B	Britain was the first one to do the computers weren't they and they shared the first computer and they got in a in a museum somewhere now
A	there's a room for it
B	it's a huge thing isn't it?
A	mm
B	massive computer
C	I saw
B	and all that was was about six six megabytes or something
C	sixteen K I think
B	sixteen K
C	but no that I just thought that was absolutely amazing that
B	yeah
C	look at that
A	right
B	okay
A	reality
C	if you stand in the room in a different way
B	takes reality as it is
A	oh wow
B	yeah
A	that's clever
B	ah
A	wow
B	that is clever
A	so is that how it's actually written?
C	that's how it's actually written
A	and you have to
C	and then when you stand in the room in a
A	it looks like the
A	wow
B	that's very clever isn't it?
A	oh
B	that is really clever
A	yeah
C	so there it is
B	I was just gonna see where that popped
C	there's more hard drive
A	oh gosh
A	and they're all off the net aren't they?
C	yeah I got those I found those
