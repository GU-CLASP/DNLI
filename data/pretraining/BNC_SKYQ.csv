A	see they've got their overnight gear it was all in his van and when one bike broke they took the wheels off and put it inside and the guy sat on the front they couldn't have afforded to have another one broke cos then they're stuck the thing about me is that I could take all the bikes and them
B	yeah
A	couldn't take any more than that so it was four of them so it was five of us in the car plus the gear plus four bikes on the top
B	right
A	and that the car wouldn't there was no space for any more so I only put er three seats in the back one sat in the front with me and all the rest of the space was taken with their overnight gear and their spares you know their tools and stuff so it was it was a complete full loaded vehicle

C	yeah mm

A	mm
B	cos it was still breakfast time and
A	mm mm
B	and a cup of tea you know that was their suggestion because they they were a bit concerned for us
A	mm
B	whether to take someone on like that
C	yeah
B	erm so I did but he decided not to come back anyway didn't he?
C	yeah
A	did he?
B	he was the idea was to come back at five o'clock
A	mm
B	but he didn't thank goodness cos it's very difficult to know what to do you know sometimes
A	yeah yeah
B	erm we've had a few difficult situations haven't we?
C	yeah
A	don't they cos they they when you're at that one you've got a there's a sort of there's a phone number you've got to somebody who's keeping an eye
C	oh there's a lot
B	oh yeah
C	there's lots of
A	what's happening
B	you're not totally on your own you know you can

B	right
A	but erm
A	no I don't no I think he was joking when he said when they were asking how much it'd be if we stay well if we stay another three nights
A	mm
B	I think there should be a discount if you're staying longer than one night because they don't have to do the bedding again do they
A	no they don't that's true
B	so we think that there could be a discount of some sort
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
C	did they?
A	I'd not seen one for ages
C	they had it on Top Gear the other night one of the most iconic vehicles ever been other than the Volkswagen

A	people import it back if they want the bullet
C	yeah well all the motorbike industry sold all their stuff the BSA all went to India

A	mm
C	who left that door open?
B	I think you did will you get me some water?
C	yeah I got the water out
B	yes
A	thank you they're really nice they had two bottles of wine between them
C	all of them?
B	what the bikers?
C	all of them?
A	mm red wine half a bottle each
B	gosh
C	that's not a lot
B	would you do it?
C	no I didn't
B	I know I mean if you're a biker
A	for me they put little glass like that just made for me and they found a jug for me that I used to have a jug of water for me
C	you used to drink
A	I know did and then I decided not to
B	if you're
A	I don't know why I decided not to oh yes I know because
C	mm
A	once the bottle's open and you're on your own it's silly because
B	mm
A	and I haven't had anything since unless brother makes me
B	right
A	but so I do that
B	you don't? not even shorts?
A	no none and it's so much easier to go to a do they know I don't drink oh you don't drink
B	oh mm
C	till I have to take two glasses with me all the time
B	you're the one that drives home
C	well I always get to be the one that drives now
B	mm
B	mm
B	no no you don't I don't say tap water I just say water
A	yeah well they normally give a bottle if you ask for that
B	yeah oh I see
A	tap water
B	make sure it's tap water yeah
C	fizzy water
B	I don't get fizzy water
C	no I don't get it
B	mm
A	we all drink tap we both drink tap water now
B	so you're great going in a pub
A	cos all all of the alcohol's got sugar in it
A	well you have to buy something else you have to buy something to eat well I wouldn't go into a pub just to drink really I've I've she likes to go the
C	which one?
A	the
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
A	which is fine cos we can sit there with a glass of water and have a carvery and she likes going there and I quite like the one at
C	where?
B	is that
A	no
C	yeah
B	they've started doing small portions now haven't they which is good
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	well it's unlimited both of them I think it's unlimited vegetables so what you can do is fill your plate right up and fill it up again with vegetables but don't ever go for the they have huge Yorkshire puddings that fill your plate up
C	oh right
B	oh
B	yeah
A	and would you like Yorkshire pudding and stuffing stuffing's a great big bit that doesn't cost anything Yorkshire pudding doesn't cost that's all there and if you said you know yes please you'd have stuffing and Yorkshire pudding and that's a third of your plate filled up
B	right
A	so that reduces what else you can put on a plate
C	of course it will yeah
B	oh
A	clever
B	mm
A	and it's and it's the stuffing's there and the Yorkshire
C	that's just sage and onion
A	bread and stuff isn't it
C	yeah
B	ah yeah
A	I don't like it and erm but it's the Yorkshire puddings that that's the one that erm fills the plate up
B	and potatoes
A	oh when we usually get you get more vegetables than you think of
C	yeah
A	but for for an evening just to go where you don't have to think about any cooking it's not that much to pay
B	mm no no not really
C	no
A	I don't have any pudding
C	no
A	cos that's how they make their money on the puddings
B	erm
C	we normally eat puddings when we're out
B	it's cheaper
C	you usually just have a starter
B	yeah I quite often just have a starter
C	I mean that starter you had that fish starter you had was big enough to
B	mm
C	call a full meal
B	it does it does depend where you go
C	yeah
B	obviously erm yeah wasn't too impressed with the last starter I had
C	we went to the
B	mm
A	mm it's getting a bit pricey in there isn't it?
C	I don't know when we went there the chicken was absolutely overcooked and it was crispy you know horrible won't it?
B	mm
C	really horrible the steak was green and it stunk it it was off
B	yeah it's a shame they've only got to have one bad
C	we've never been again
B	chef they changed the chef but the the image is still there isn't it?
C	mm mm yeah it was such a shame cos that was around the street
B	it is a shame I think we did try it again actually
A	there's a thing on the internet that they were talking about was a group when they were there the two people
B	mm
A	they do make a good comment if it's a bad comment don't put it on trip advisor cos you could kill a place
C	yeah
A	you put one bad comment on trip advisor and no one would go to it
B	no I know sad isn't it?
A	it's very sad so one person has got the hump that night
C	yes
A	and it wasn't the way they liked it
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and that's it
B	you just got a grievance with an actual person
A	mm mm mm
B	nothing to do with the place
A	yeah
B	well you can't take that can you?
A	no
B	well you could if you want
A	no
C	you can ask to have them removed you can ask trip advisor to have it removed and they have to look into it and
B	they took the whole lot off you couldn't leave just the good comments could you?
C	no but if if it's a degrading comment and you've got everybody else's comments are like lovely then you've got this one
B	mm
A	but what is there to stop erm somebody up the road who's got a similar thing putting
C	yeah yeah
A	I mean you do it to them and it could go on couldn't it
C	yeah I think they have to know where the source of erm comments
A	yeah they have to verify it so that you've got oh maybe yeah yeah
C	some wicked people about I suppose
A	uhu well this happened with dad with with
C	yeah
A	they came in and sorted it out and said you know they ended up doing most of what dad did but we had always had a a price war on black bin bags
C	yeah
A	we're not
B	yeah
A	you know if we found a cheaper source and you know knocked our price down old
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I gave it a good shove I did
A	mm?
C	drawer well
A	mm
C	I thought it was a soft closing drawer but it's not

A	the right size plate to use according to the the
B	is it?
A	that's probably ten inches
B	that probably is yeah
C	are all the other ones ten inches?

C	and they've still got some of the the paintings on the wall were done by the monks
B	yeah stuff like that there were done on the walls
B	yes they're called
A	I was gonna say it looks very similar yeah
B	mm
A	yeah oh this is here this as well where the
B	yeah
A	goes back
B	yeah
A	and that's
B	they reckon Westminster Abbey is based on the design of this
A	do they?
A	right
B	that's what they think
C	yeah
B	but er
A	I've been inside the Abbey well on these planks going through yeah and walked right around the outside cos when they when they redid the led
C	mm
A	they had scaffolding and they took us all up the skids
C	mm
A	we did very privileged we walked right round
C	yeah
A	and we went right the way around and then we went right the way around on the inside up
C	yeah it's beautiful
A	well it is if I hadn't known I would have said that's Westminster looking up from the cloisters
B	yes
A	I'd have thought there would have been a cloister there yeah?
C	yeah
A	there were some
C	yeah
B	erm
C	no really?
B	there weren't any cloisters there were there?
A	the flying buttress
C	yes there are cloisters yeah
A	the flying buttress is there then there would have been a cloister there
C	there was cloisters mm
B	yeah
A	wow that's lovely
B	there's some bits from the friary
A	what a lovely book
C	that's the friary that's all the bits from the
B	it didn't come out very well that's cos we
A	oh
B	mm yeah
A	but what these these people have put are still like that there's still a gap there
C	yeah
A	not being written on
B	yeah just little bits of writing
A	well what what I shall remember is how friendly everybody was and how they all worked together
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	we were all you know there was a whole crowd of you in that little kitchen and
C	yeah it's lovely isn't it?
B	yes
A	and yet everybody erm just just gets on you know and if you've got something in the sink you wash it up you know it's
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's brilliant
C	well that's how it is in all
C	yeah
B	the only thing that's funny in that place was the the reception it's like a little cupboard isn't it?
C	yeah
A	oh I didn't go there
B	oh you probably didn't go
A	no well the thing is because because they were having such fun there with the people looking after it they the place was open anyway and she said do come in it was her husband who was the official one I think
B	yeah
A	and she just followed him round and so erm he'd be back shortly and actually they didn't book us in until next day they gave us a little slip and then
B	oh
A	she said well I'll show you where you're gonna be anyway and you can get yourselves all settled down
B	oh
C	crickey
A	that was fine
C	yeah yeah
A	plumbing made an awful noise though when you turned the tap on in the dormitory clunk clunk clunk clunk
C	oh the clunk clunk clunk yep yeah
A	so how long ago were you there and no one sorted it?
C	er
A	cos you turn the tap on it turned how many years ago?
B	when were we there? erm about three years ago now
A	so for three years in the middle of the night if you turn the tap on you go to the loo turn the tap on clunk clunk clunk
C	yeah clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk
B	oh I can't remember that
A	and the
B	oh gosh
A	then when I got downstairs it's the alarm panel that you put a key in
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	that was beeping
B	well
A	erm and so I now know that one of my ears isn't right because when one was faced downwards towards towards it I could hear it and when the other turned around I couldn't hear it when the other my other ear was down
C	oh right
A	and I've come to the conclusion somebody had perhaps left an alarm in the bedding or something one of the beds that wasn't being used
C	yeah
A	only on the last night it did it
C	oh
B	mm
A	but it was showing something was wrong with one area in the building or something
C	that's right yeah
C	we have we have to reset both of them and press one two three when it's done
B	mm
A	perhaps someone smoked in the room and they shouldn't have done or something I don't know
C	a lot of the problem is erm
B	not many people do that
C	no
B	you're not supposed to smoke most people I don't know anyone that's done that
C	a lot of the problem with that with that is people who use hairspray
A	oh is it? yeah
C	and that will set the alarm off
A	mm
C	or set off you know it's hairspray
B	mm
A	mm
C	and we we had a we had a when we we were we worked at in
B	antiperspirants
C	yeah antiperspirant and hairspray they said
B	yeah
C	yeah and erm we had a do when we were we were just staying at the hostel eleven o'clock whoo whoo whoo the alarm went off
B	yeah we went to bed early
C	we went to bed early
B	well earlyish we thought it was in the middle of the night
C	we had to get up and we were running out and everybody had to go running out and there was a poor girl coming out the shower
B	yeah
C	just a towel round her
C	and we all to stand outside you know at a special fire point and er was it that we were too far away for the fire brigade?
B	yeah this particular one er it was a hairpin bend just as you get up to the hostel
A	mm
B	absolutely awful
A	was that
B	yeah
C	oh
C	yeah
B	yeah it's called something else now
C	yeah you go up and you just with a car you have to take three
A	getting around the corner mm
C	so no fire engine could possibly get up there so if anything happened the woman wouldn't
B	there wasn't a warden or manager there
C	there wasn't a warden she was over
B	she lived down the village
A	yeah
B	so we were all like no one knew what to do apart from
C	over and hour and a half
B	to get there
C	to get up there so the alarm could be turned off and what have you cos we weren't wardens then we were just staying there
B	mm
A	mm
C	and er she come up and turned the alarm off and we said well what happened if if it is a fire
B	it's a real one
C	well just let it burn down you see
B	isn't that awful?
A	well if there's no alternative
B	I mean there's there's fire fire extinguishers obviously people would use them
C	mm
B	but there's no way no way a fire engine could get up there
C	and you would have thought that the warden would have been staying at the place anyway
B	yeah
C	but she was at home
B	no that's that's the worst thing I that would be our worst nightmare to have a fire
C	oh yeah
B	because I don't really know how to use those extinguishers either
B	well you do you do associate yeah you'd you would know but
A	it's simple it's not
C	yeah but they
A	spray it on the base of the fire
C	there's all sorts of fire
A	people will aim it at the
C	that's right
B	mm
A	but you aim at the base of it
C	but then there's two or three different fire fire extinguishers
A	yeah you can't put water on electrical
B	yeah that's right
A	the safest one to grab is the blue one's powder
C	yeah
A	and you use powder for anything
B	are there any blue ones?
C	no they're all red
B	they're all red
A	no red's water I think
B	no there are different ones
C	there's foam
A	really?
C	there's foam
A	is there a foam? but it's only for an electrical fire
B	I know they do have different ones
C	yeah there there's three different ones
B	what you have to do when you when you arrive you have to go round know where all things are and that you do do quite a bit of studying for about two days don't you you know make sure you know exactly what you are doing
C	it's quite good though
A	when you think how many years these properties have been here it's not likely to
C	no
B	and that's why we have a no smoking policy we've never seen anyone they've gone outside
A	yeah yeah there's a whole group going outside for a cigarette
B	yeah I think so
C	it's a shame really when you've got to go outside every ten minutes or quarter of an hour
A	well I don't know I don't know whether it didn't really smell of tobacco so he might be puffing something else
A	he was such a character this bloke
B	mm
A	yeah he was really good well they all were they were they were all totally different
C	one of our friends don't even come here now of course she smokes
A	mm
C	you know
A	well why don't they stop smoking? I mean that's friends are more important than smoking aren't they?
B	yeah they're they're people well she used to have friends as well that used to smoke around you go for a meal you have to have a starter
A	yeah
B	smoke
C	and up the table
B	up the table yeah have the next course smoke have the pudding smoke
C	smoke
B	and then smoke the rest of the evening
A	it's habit
B	yeah yeah it is
C	well I used to smoke you used to smoke
A	yeah I know
C	you give up
A	yeah I managed to give up yeah
B	yeah mm
C	it was difficult
A	mm
C	and
A	mm
C	he used to go in the front room and smoke up the chimney
A	did he?
C	yeah
B	can't remember
C	I can't remember that
B	you don't remember after a while do you?
A	no
B	those sort of things
A	no
B	no
C	have you given up?
A	now what I'm wondering about? if I go and get my
C	yeah
A	and er and I'll take some pictures I think
C	yeah and you can send them
B	and put them on our website ah
A	there'll only be on my little little camera
C	that don't matter
C	well I have to I have to make them smaller anyway to get them on the website you can't have ten gigabyte or megabyte of
A	well it'll give the idea won't it
C	yeah yeah
A	erm
C	how's the bell ringing tonight?
A	I don't know
B	the what?
C	do you want to go bell ringing?
A	it was on the hand out didn't you know?
B	yes
A	I don't know when they're going to dish out our shirts
B	mm
A	there's there's only really about there's four of us and you need six to ring
B	yeah
A	that's a minimum there's four of us that can read music
C	mm
A	erm but there are some who just can't fathom that and they they have have their their notes are coloured so they you know they know that they're orange but you've always got the one on the line is your left hand and the one on the gap on the stave is your right hand so they they're just marked where they are they know if it's on the line it's that hand like that
B	hmm
A	it's such a laugh but so there's really only three of us that can read music properly but even on on some of the ones who just have it marked it's easier if you mark the colours but you keeping putting it on a different note but if and because you can have a whole load of bells ringing if you can have the whole erm twelve bells all say ringing all at once or something then you can't find your note or ten of them's ringing
B	oh great
A	can you imagine blob blob blob blob blob and you can't really work out whether yours is there
B	yeah
A	cos the table's that wide you're stood one side of the table the music's over there because your bells are down in front of it
C	yeah
A	so I had to get some special reading glasses one and a half's which
A	you see so I have to wear special ones
B	yeah
A	for ringing
A	Ebay
C	Ebay
A	seven pound but I can now read the music
C	oh
A	well apparently you can get them in the pound shop
B	yeah but at least you can try them on
A	I could I suppose yeah
C	I think it's kind of important to try those
A	well when I tried I knew I knew it had to be a one point five
B	oh I see
A	cos hers were a one point five
A	okay
A	so and it worked see it takes these maths she's a maths teacher mindful A Level maths she teaches
C	these glasses are a four I've got
A	four?
C	yeah they're really big aren't they
A	but these it's terribly difficult with vary-focal cos you can't you can't you can see your bell close but from there
C	oh that's awful
A	yeah
C	I can't do it I have to wear my reading glasses when I'm doing computer because I can't keep doing this all the time
A	I just hope these people haven't paid for us cos it's fifty pound for six people yeah
B	fifty pounds?
A	fifty pounds
B	for?
A	for us to go and play the normal rate
B	oh right oh
A	but it covers travelling and things
B	yeah yeah
A	if we've got to go to the coast will all of us it helps cover travel and the hall has got to be hired for practices you see
B	mm
A	but we just have such a good laugh you know when we go wrong we just burst out laughing it's not it's not we should take it really seriously though sides
C	your names as well
A	mm
C	your name as well onto the
A	no no
A	it hurts your ribs though both sides it hurts your ribs it's really weird yeah
C	yeah
A	and if you don't come in you get a whack in your ribs because you can't move because the bells stay here the elbow comes out and hits you
A	it's mainly
B	so you don't want to miss it
A	I don't know I just like it I think it's a bit of fun it's a good laugh
C	yeah
A	erm there's only three blokes there's
C	are they that big?
A	there's a real weight to lift the things up the big ones
B	uhu
A	then you can go ding dong ding ding dong you know he's he's he's totally brilliant at it
C	yeah
A	erm and then there's myself the rest are girls because it is serious multitasking and I can't multitask
B	no
A	he's really serious
B	yeah
A	multitasking
C	yeah
A	sometimes it they've given me four bells before so you've got two that don't get used very much so you've got one you're ringing all the time ding ding but then you can go that sideways and bring in another one but they only ring in one direction
B	ah okay
A	you know gong so you've got ding ding ding ding you see
B	oh
A	like that
C	yeah
A	and then you can't remember which one's ringing which direction
A	you can't remember if that's that that that one or that that one and you've tried to and then they've only got their names on one side of the leathers
C	oh right
A	and then you have to wear gloves so you don't spoil the polish can't put your hands onto the metal
B	yeah
A	cos the more you polish them the more they go out of tune
C	yeah
B	right
A	so so you
B	no no
A	I'm mean that's one drink isn't it if you went out
C	I don't know
A	that's probably half a drink isn't it?
C	I've got no idea I don't go out
A	so I think to belong to it it's not bad
B	mm
A	anyway right so I think what I will do then and then I'll
C	well there's no hurry
A	well I'm just worried that the flowers will be gone they are so beautiful
B	it'll be nice to get them
A	before somebody decides they're gonna change what's in the church
B	yeah yeah okay
A	is today Wednesday? no it's Thursday
B	it's Thursday
A	so there won't be anybody down there so I've got to go and get my key thank you for lunch
B	it's okay
A	so if I bring that back how long does it take to pop it on?
C	well that depends whether I have to do any work on the program
A	oh okay it might just be checking it out a bit okay
C	you can just put a photograph
A	okay
A	no it's not it's Thursday
C	uh
A	why did you do the uh?
C	uh
A	you didn't do it the second time
C	sorry sorry no I didn't know cos it
A	apparently they do loads of weddings aren't weddings awful I said no actually they're jolly easy cos a lot of the time they'll just want us there to ring the peel because they haven't got bells in the church that work
B	oh yeah
A	and we just ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
B	do they?
C	so what's going on with the church bells then?
A	no they they get asked to go to churches or to halls where they haven't got bells
C	oh
A	to ring bells at the end of the wedding
C	oh I see I see
A	and he said actually the weddings are is money for our rope cos they will pay for the wedding
B	mm
A	they won't sometimes if they know the people and it's for charity they won't we'll just ask for just a fuel charge to help just so you know they don't make a loss
B	yeah
A	erm but
B	because you have to get to the venues and that don't you
A	oh yeah yeah but for the weddings and there is a definite charge
C	well there's gotta be hasn't there yeah
A	and then he told me how much an organ costs actually oh in America you pay thousands of pounds for an organist
C	really
A	there's none about now
C	no
B	yeah you can carry on going
A	to play erm erm a church organ
C	yeah
A	they pay thousands for a wedding
C	oh well there you go
A	well nowadays it's two hundred pounds
C	well there's two speakers there
C	yes
A	well I've got one of these that plays DVDs
C	that play music?
A	I've never had a thing
C	it'll play music
A	will it?
C	mm
