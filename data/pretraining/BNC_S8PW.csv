A	oh nice and warm
B	that's good
A	good
B	your house is warm enough for you?
A	yes
B	well are you warm in the bed?
A	yes cos I've put two duvets
B	oh that's good
B	er
B	and that's the main thing you can't get to sleep can you?
B	I expect you've got a sleeping bag
A	I have got one yeah
B	yes well get into that it'll be worth it
A	right
B	and have you met any of your neighbours yet?
A	erm I met the oh yes they're good yes thank you
C	is that alright?
A	yes yes they're good
C	mm
A	so what do I owe you altogether?
C	oh
A	oh okay alright well I'll have a look
C	and I just
A	yes so they exactly they're a bit like these doors aren't they?
C	I think yeah they're
A	they've got a sort of cross in the middle
C	I would do it
A	yes that's good
C	yeah
A	thank you
B	if you had to do that yourself would that be a problem?
A	well
A	I did do the chairs all by myself
B	yes
A	but I wouldn't be very confident drilling into a wall
B	well
A	or the door
C	the door'll be fine
A	yes because if you put furniture together then
B	yes
C	mm
A	you can't go that wrong
B	no
A	but yes if you went into a wall wrong
B	yes
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	wouldn't be very happy about that
B	that wouldn't be a good idea
A	no
C	erm
A	that's good
B	er so you met some neighbours did you say?
A	well I met the Lithuanians
B	yes have you seen them since?
A	with dad the first day no I've never seen them again
B	oh dear
A	it's a bit strange round there that street's very quiet that one
B	is it?
A	and then
C	it's at right angle to you is it?
A	no they're at the end on the corner
C	on the end of the same street? or
A	so if you on the way out
C	yeah
A	you turn the corner
C	oh that's what I thought
A	and the first one on your right
C	yeah just round the corner
A	yes
C	yeah
A	and then I met the other people who were directly opposite to the right in the big detached one
B	right
A	once
B	okay oh right
A	and then they've put up two buy to let or to let signs as someone's done buy to let
B	right
A	there's no one there
C	ah so
A	that whole
C	somebody's
A	and the lady next door seems to have gone away cos her car's never there now
B	oh right
A	so it's very very quiet
C	so a couple of people have bought them to let them?
A	yes
C	to rent?
A	it looks like it
C	yeah
A	and the rest aren't finished
B	no
A	the one the terraced at er detached at the end isn't finished
C	no
A	they're still all going inside the builders
C	no
A	they'd dug up several places in the road in front of me
C	what for a pipe? or
A	for the Virgin Media pack
B	ah really?
A	and now they have to re-tarmac the whole thing again
B	oh dear
A	the truck's not coming with the tarmac don't know maybe next week so they've messed it up but it's fine they've filled in the holes now
B	ah get out
A	get out again but it's not tarmacked now
A	that's all they've put the fence up now
C	ah
A	so they can't any more
C	yeah
A	and churned it all up so that's all closed off so they can only walk around now
C	right
A	so I see the workmen a lot they're the only people I see on the road cos it's sort of their shortcut to the car park
B	mm right okay oh right yes
C	yeah
A	but they can only walk now they can't drive
B	to get to know those
A	yes I know them I know what they're doing
B	yes
A	and they're very friendly they tell me what they're doing
B	oh good and it's good you've joined the choir because at least that's something you don't know the people in your road cos
A	no
B	at least you know
A	yes it's good
B	have you been to that Co-op at all?
A	once it's okay there's not loads there I mean it's good for sort of
A	you know I can get if I run out of milk
B	yes getting some milk
A	can get milk and bread there
B	oh no no
A	I'll just drive to
B	oh yeah okay that's
A	and then fill up the car while I'm there
B	yes so that'll take you what quarter of an hour?
A	quarter of an hour but it's worth it cos the prices
B	not bad is it?
A	are much better
B	yes
A	and there's more choice
B	yeah they have
B	yeah yes
A	didn't have an ice scraper this week
B	oh yeah
A	there was a thick frost on the car
B	well we haven't had that here
A	thick like a
B	yes
A	couple of centimetres almost
B	yes
A	seemed like that had to get a credit card and scrape it off
B	mm
A	was not very good for it
A	yes I didn't have that either
A	no the other thing's to turn on the car isn't it? a minute before you leave
B	yes
A	and put the heater on
B	yes
A	yes
C	erm did you want one sugar
A	erm no thank you
C	no sugar?
A	no sugar thank you
B	thank you
A	I know
B	it's two two and a half weeks I think
A	yes it's good
B	full marks
A	yes I mean that's good in a way though isn't it?
B	I I think it's better yeah and then and then by the time you have time to breathe you actually you're quite well established
A	yes
B	cos otherwise you're
A	mm
B	so get going
A	yes
B	mm
A	thank you dad
C	oh
B	oh
A	so
C	what? ice from where?
A	it was really icy one morning
B	it's different weather where
A	really really cold
C	but it
A	it really went down
C	have you got an ice scraper now?
A	I went today to the supermarket and got one
C	in Tesco's or?
A	yes
C	yeah
A	yes
C	I mean for things like that you know they're good
A	yeah they're good yes
C	pardon?
A	I had a choice of three sorts of ice scraper
B	oh right
A	yes
B	and the train service is actually good so all that's gone
A	well yeah it's only one an hour so it's not that good for work
B	oh no oh
A	because they
C	wrong time
A	they're yes they're they leave on the half hour
B	mm
A	I mean actually start the lesson the hour
B	yes
A	so it's not enough time
B	no
A	so it means I'd have to go an hour and a half early
B	well that's a pity isn't it?
A	yeah so that's not so good so on my late day which is Tuesday
B	okay
A	cos it goes oh the good thing is it goes at nine thirty-one so then you're on off-peak
B	oh right okay so that's good
A	peak so they've worked that out quite carefully
C	yeah
A	so that's quite thoughtful
B	yes
A	but all the other days
B	yes
A	cos I'd have to get the seven thirty train
B	yes
A	to be sure of getting there for ten to nine
C	and then do a bit of
B	unless you have work to
A	and I'd be paying the peak train fare
A	yes
B	mm
A	and two pounds thirty it's the same for a single and a return but I mean two pounds thirty is fine
B	yes
A	yeah off-peak
B	yeah that's very good
A	because you see the peak hours I think I need to double check but I think peak hours are only in the morning there is no
C	right
A	peak in the afternoon
A	yeah so it's after nine thirty is off-peak
B	so you've got a single track line there
B	so
A	that's maybe why then they can only do one an hour
B	so where so where does the train come in from there there?
A	erm
B	ah right okay
C	yeah that
A	but
C	they're they're the
A	yes
C	pass
A	it's quick
C	oh right to
B	yeah that
A	mm
C	is it the first stop?
A	second there's
C	yeah
B	yes
A	yes so it's quick and
B	yes
A	less of a hill actually
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yes but I'll try cycling anyway
B	that's good
A	got dad's bike
A	yes
C	you know under the seat there's a
A	yes
C	if you pass the
A	through that
C	through that as well as through part of the frame
A	oh yes
C	you could then tie it to something so you don't need to remove the
A	oh that's a good idea so I'll try that this week
C	you don't don't need to remove
A	yes that might work better
C	the seat
A	mm
C	yeah
A	be a bit obvious if you went in with

B	she was very pleased when I went there I took about eight books in
A	oh that's nice
B	she said oh they're all in excellent condition
A	yes
B	cos I don't hold onto things for too long because it's better for somebody to benefit by reading the book
A	yes it's true if you're not going to read it again there really isn't much of a point is there?
B	well no there isn't it's silly really keeping books
A	yes

B	it's in a lot of recipes
A	yes I don't
B	well I don't either
A	no
C	we had sort of jam as well
A	yes I've taken all that off
B	it's one of those sad situations I don't know if he's still doing but
A	ah
B	and he doesn't like chocolate cake
B	and didn't say it'd be a huge one to eat by himself so
A	is he? oh
B	is is
A	but it was like great grandma with the bananas wasn't it?
B	mm with bananas

B	yes
A	yes
B	we went to a nice restaurant on Friday between
A	oh right
B	yes
A	oh yes I like that
B	cognac oh you've had that before have you?
A	well not with cognac just
B	uhu
A	coffee and ice cream
B	okay
A	that's quite popular
B	oh is it?
A	it's called affogato
B	oh right I never had that before
A	have a coffee and an ice cream but then you think that's quite extravagant that's a good way round it
B	that's what I said to grandpa I said there's no need to buy coffee now
A	yes
C	did he have the same?
B	yes I don't know if he knew what it well I don't know if he knew what it was or not
C	well at least he likes ice cream
B	yes
A	so it's good in a hot country
B	oh yes
A	so you get the cold ice cream and then coffee's usually hot
B	yes
A	mm
C	mm
B	yes
B	I'm trying to think what it's called but anyway it was a bit of a place to go the plaice was just instead of giving you a little bit of plaice you know it's thin and we have like three
A	yeah
B	good sliced pieces
A	cor
B	beautifully cooked and then potatoes which were done in a creamy sauce garlic sauce
A	oh right
B	it was lovely
A	mm
B	grandpa couldn't eat much of his so I had his as well
A	yeah it's good
C	was it was it the
C	that's on the left isn't it when you're driving down?
B	yes and it's no
C	from here
B	it's not expensive it's no more than anywhere else to be honest
A	oh right
B	if you order fish it always costs more
A	mm
B	anyway
A	yes that's good it's reopened
C	yeah oh yes mine was
B	yes
A	so what happened with people before?
B	they fell out with the villagers I don't know what happened but people didn't like them
A	mm
B	and people didn't go there at all
A	yeah
B	and so in the end you know really there was no trade there at all it closed down
C	but they weren't friendly
A	no
C	no they weren't
B	and the food wasn't special I
C	well they chopped the menu by about three quarters I think straight away
B	did they? oh yes
C	they only had like three or four things and they were very sort of snack things
B	ah yes
C	very you know sort of er
A	mm
B	yes because
A	yes
B	and I think if the pub could get going and have people coming from outside
A	yeah yeah mm
B	it would make a lot of difference to the village
A	yes it's true
B	just like
A	yes
B	so I said if dad and I went there just once a month and we all did that then that could make a make a difference
A	yes it's true
B	they seemed very pleasant
A	yes
B	yeah
A	friendly
B	yes
A	mm
B	it was a big venture for them because I think they come from the south east
C	yeah
B	so to move down here with no experience of running a business
C	was it
A	yes
B	quite a big thing
A	yes it is
B	but they must have employed a good chef to have such good quality meals there
A	yes they yes that's right
B	mm
A	so that's good
B	cos you get tired of it at some pubs don't you? when it's the same thing all the time on the menu
A	yes well it's good they had a couple of specials
B	cos you'd
A	they had three actually didn't they?
C	yeah
B	yes
A	plus the starters that's quite good
B	mm hm
A	mm
B	well I'll go and get those books
A	oh thank you
B	I'll just go
A	yes
C	there's not the light switch immediately near is there?
A	on the landing
C	oh no I mean where you're gonna put the
B	no
C	no cos they normally run vertically
A	oh right
C	yes if you place it on the floor
A	okay
C	and I'll put it up as high as I
A	yes
C	and those single hooks I'll put a cross point
A	yes
C	at the top of
A	yes
C	you know
A	on top of the yeah
C	at that height cos then
A	yes that's good
A	yes thank you
C	and then you know because that'll be the same colour or very near
A	yes that's right
C	erm
A	erm they come every week
C	cos you
A	for the for the recycling
C	oh every week for the recycling? so that's so that's like
A	yes but I haven't quite worked out the day but it's something midweek so I just put out
A	oh goodness that's a lot
B	well there's a few more there than I thought
A	oh dear
B	cos you said to keep the books for when you didn't have time to look last time or something
A	yeah
B	and so I did but then the pile got ridiculous I thought I'm not gonna like half these books
B	no I read
A	it's good
B	I think I don't sleep that well so if I'm awake for two hours in the night
A	mm
B	yes he did
C	yes
B	have you read any of his
A	yeah but I can't think what but I've read some of his others
B	Chesil Beach is that in Ian Mcewan
A	oh I haven't read that one
B	now you see that won prize the Booker Prize but
A	yes I've heard of this
B	but actually I didn't
A	you didn't like it?
B	no that's the funny thing isn't it with some of them?
C	what's the book?
B	but you might like it but I couldn't
A	The Narrow Road To The Deep North
B	I read it all but I couldn't really get into it
A	mm
B	yes so that's the best seller seller now and it has been for a while
A	oh right yes that
C	do you want a bit more coffee
A	oh yes please thank you
B	well yeah that'd be it cos you can't really decide now can you?
A	no thank you
B	I know I do
A	good thank you
B	er The Ice Twins that was quite good
A	ah yes
A	they look good
B	yes and
A	yes
B	erm
A	thank you yes I
B	yes and she did erm the one on the Greek island erm
A	yes
B	and that but people say the first one and I agree it was far the best
A	ah right
B	yes but the others are nice but not as good
A	yes
B	yes
A	that was one about the leprosy wasn't it? the lepers' island
B	yeah that's it that's
A	that was good
A	I think that was called The Thread
B	I don't think I think
A	or was that not the one?
B	that's another one
A	oh right
B	yes I must say it is in the middle of the night my reading generally
A	cor
B	but I think that in my age group a lot of people have problems with sleep
A	yes
B	well I think I do but erm just
B	it's so they say that but I I think I do after all the exercise
A	yes well anyway everyone's different
B	yes exactly
A	yes
B	so if I wake up at the moment I go to sleep and I might wake up about four
A	mm
B	read for a couple of hours then if I'm lucky I get back to sleep at six with but if I have to go to work of course that'd be very annoying
A	dear
B	yes
B	the news
A	ah I don't have a television at the moment
B	no
A	but I've been watching Netflix er one thing every night
B	ah that's good
A	thirty minutes
B	what have you been watching then?
B	uhu
A	about a middle class woman who has done something bad when she was in her twenties
B	oh right
A	and the law catches up with her and that's how it starts she's got to go to prison but you know she's
B	ah
A	really middle class
B	that must be difficult
A	you know actually in a way it's worse isn't it?
B	mm
A	because if she was from a family where lots of people have been in and out of prison then it wouldn't be as bad have you heard of that? Orange Is The New Black?
B	mm
A	about this middle class American
C	oh right yes yes
A	young in her thirties but she ends up in prison
C	yeah yeah
A	it's quite funny
C	yeah
A	cos she's really unsuitable
C	no
A	and of course they give her a really hard time
C	oh
B	yes
A	er but she's getting on okay now but then of course the looks at the effect on her relationship outside where she's changed
B	yeah
A	because of her prison experience but of course they haven't
B	yes
A	have you watched that?
C	I haven't actually that
A	it's quite very funny yeah it's quite witty and it yeah it's quite I suppose quite observant because in a way it'd be more difficult if you were nothing like
C	yeah
A	any of the other people
C	yeah
A	she just has to get on with it
B	so that's your way you're relaxing
A	yes that's good in the evenings
A	yes that's true yes I thought that
B	so when you get time you want to go and see what sort of curtain rails
A	no dad and I did look didn't we? we we went to erm
C	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah we went to Wickes and had a look
B	do you like this sort or not?
A	yes it and we saw some like this and to be honest they were cheaper weren't they than the the fake metal ones?
C	yeah that fake metal one
A	I don't really understand
C	I didn't think was very good
A	no
B	cos until we came here we always
A	not that strong
B	we didn't have these much
C	no
B	from previous houses we just had what were what were they straight metal?
C	erm actually they're
C	they're plastic rails
A	but these run well don't they?
C	er yes
A	cos they're big hooks
C	oh yes yes they don't
A	they don't
C	drag
A	yes
B	so we've got some brown ones
A	yes
B	yes
A	yes
B	except I don't expect you'll be making yourself you're buying ready made
A	probably
B	yes
A	I yes in Oman I got them made up I bought the fabric but it's cheap there to get things made up
C	yeah probably
A	yes very cheap tailoring
B	mm
A	see
B	yes I was phoning
A	yes
C	I I I I just just
B	I can't understand it
A	so much up there
C	well they might be there but there's
A	yes
C	er you can't start moving all the boxes
A	no
C	erm cos you've got nowhere to move them to
A	no
C	mm
A	maybe I should take a couple back of mine
C	right
A	when I go today
C	I saw one you might like it's called er it's a small one it says
B	we wondered whether to
C	it's not not the heavy one
B	we wondered whether to bring everything down cos we're up dad was up looking for the curtains I was waiting to
A	oh right
B	receive them the other end
A	yes it
B	I thought oh well perhaps not so that'd be in the way
A	yes
B	oh oh did I?
A	yes you said I bought you that
A	and I said I know but
B	oh that's funny cos I don't remember that was that when we were here?
A	yeah yes I tried to give some away to charity but you got upset
B	oh
C	well you'll have to give it
A	but I can't keep them forever
B	no no er er
C	no
A	I can keep one maybe but I can't keep millions can I?
B	no no no
A	no
B	I gave up you know you gave me all those
A	mm
B	and there was nowhere to put them here
A	oh yes cos you had room didn't you?
B	and I gave them away but I'm always a bit upset I gave them away I sort of almost wish I'd kept them in a box in the roof space then
A	yeah
B	but it's silly because I'm not going to look at them
A	no and and
B	it's just sentimental
A	and in Wales you did have somewhere to put them there were those shelves weren't there?
B	yeah we did yeah that's it there wasn't wasn't there isn't much here really
A	no
B	erm but I'm sort of sorry I did anyway
A	yes
C	what shelves were those?
A	erm well there was one sort of a lintel piece above going into the lounge
B	yeah that's
C	ah yeah oh yes
A	down the stairs and then all the way up the stairs there were shelves weren't there?
C	through the
B	yes there were and utility room
C	yes that's right
A	yeah
B	that was a good house for six of us wasn't it?
A	yes quite spread out
B	had a lot of space kind of thing yeah
C	it was spread out yeah
B	and it was ideal really in that way
A	yes
B	er well anyway you can give the teddies away
A	yes
C	yeah
A	felt bad
B	I don't remember that
A	yes
C	and there's
A	well the Spanish ones I gave to
C	oh no no but English about English
B	oh did you? oh that's nice
A	yes because she's learnt Spanish but there's one
C	oh no in the roof space it's like
A	oh in the roof space ah
C	you know theory of language teaching type
A	oh right ah
C	more theoretical type books
A	oh right I don't remember those
B	and there's a French dictionary don't know if that's yours? by the bedside table
A	no
B	oh so
A	I didn't have any French the French ones'd be
B	oh oh I'll ask them then but must be
A	yeah
B	okay
A	Chinese might be
C	well no there there's there's
B	it'll be funny when we do sort the roof space out because we can
A	you're gonna have loads of room
C	well
B	yeah but there's things that are like there's one thing that's joint isn't there? it's that globe I think
A	I know
B	is still up there you've gotta decide what to do with that
A	yes
B	and there's a cuckoo clock isn't there?
A	yes I'd like to get that fixed one day there was something wrong with it wasn't there?
B	well we
A	oh did she?
B	yes I don't know if it was er quite right but she must have sorted it out and she decided to have it in her room and her Christmas present
A	well I think I just gave in didn't I? oh
C	probably yeah
B	seems a bit of a funny thing to do but anyway she she agreed that we'd have it repaired and that was her present
A	oh right
B	and she had it in her room in Wales for a few years
A	oh right
B	that must be up in the roof space now
A	yes
C	that would have gone then to her when she wanted everything sent to Australia
B	well yes
C	cos everything got packed
B	yes
A	and then she never took it did she?
B	no that was really strange cos I paid I mean don't tell her a hundred pounds
A	oh dear
B	for the contact but I mean she offered to pay but I
B	boxes came dad put them all together and he spent a whole day
A	dear
B	getting the stuff out of the roof space putting it in dad marked it all down
C	oh no it took more than a day to be honest
B	and then it stood in the hallway for ages and
C	yeah
B	and people were saying to me have you ever been to Australia? the pupils
A	dear
B	but no no and then we moved upstairs again out of the way and in the end she didn't want it
C	did the
B	and we had to unpack we couldn't put it back in the roof space
B	cos the boxes wouldn't fit up there we had to unpack it all
A	dear
C	oh the the big boxes didn't they
B	yeah yeah
A	oh did she want all of those?
B	she said that she was going to start practising the piano or keyboard could I send her out with some books cos it's so expensive to buy them out there
A	yes
B	send them out so I spent ages looking through couldn't find any of hers anyway
A	ah that's good
B	fifteen pounds
A	yes books are cheap usually to send cos I did that coming back from Japan
B	er second class
A	there was a special book rate
C	yeah
B	yes
A	as long as you only sent books
B	well fortunately I put the sender on the back so anyway she said could be up to three months it goes all the way out there now to be fair to
B	she had had that awful cancer diagnosis
A	yes
B	but anyway it said the books had arrived she never went to collect them
C	downstairs
B	and about two months later they all arrived back here
B	they've been all the way to Australia and back
A	dear that's cheap though isn't it?
B	but
A	fifteen pounds
B	that was pretty good I don't yeah
A	that's amazing mm
B	so
A	mm
B	but I think that was slightly different to the boxes because she was ill and that it obviously knocked her
A	yeah
B	but the other one was funny with the boxes but I think it's as well all the things didn't go out there
A	and she was moving as well
B	yeah she's never had room to put them
A	yes
B	anyway
A	dear
C	you'd be amazed what erm what's up there of yours
A	yes bet there's more clothes there must be
C	there's
B	and books I think second-hand books cos used to
A	mm yes
B	I used to get them you used to collect them didn't you?
A	mm
B	mm yes
A	cookbooks I've got which I'd like
B	okay
A	mm it's quite useful cos I've got the it's quite nice in the kitchen they've left two shelves haven't they? for
C	yeah
A	for things that's quite nice
C	yeah
A	one can be for books cookbooks
B	well
A	yes
A	well I'm going to give most of those away
C	yeah that's it you give away whatever but you know that's your that's your decision
A	but mum might get upset
B	no I won't get that's fine
C	and you give away whatever
A	do it when
A	mm I don't remember that one
B	that's
A	no no there's a turkey you gave me I don't
B	a turkey?
A	yes you got very upset
B	I can't remember
B	that's why it's a bit strange that I'd be upset
A	that's
B	if it was a the like she made
A	Postman Pat
B	Postman Pat
A	yeah
B	I might be a little bit sentimental about that
A	yes
B	cos she's not here
A	that's right
B	but I wouldn't be about other things
A	yes
B	I can't remember giving you a turkey
C	oh the Postman Pat was that
A	I think that was
B	was it?
A	yes
B	well that's what we'll do
A	no
B	it's just gonna get in a muddle you might as well have it when you're ready
A	yes it might as well be anything other than
B	clothes yeah
A	although I
B	boots yes yes
C	well I think I know
A	cos they were down here
C	yeah I think I might know where they are
B	ah yes
A	cos that would be useful if it's muddy
C	yeah
B	well no I've shown
A	the other thing I wanted to buy was my panniers cos I've got panniers haven't I for the bike?
C	they'll be in the roof space
A	yeah I won't get it today I'll I'll find erm
C	yeah
A	for now
A	goodness
B	it was just an instant decision that I was going to have some wellingtons so I went to
A	yes they're nice
B	oh oh right is that good is it? Dunlop?
A	oh yes yes same as the tyres
C	oh right mm
B	oh right and then if you pulled this you see pull it tight
A	ah yes good
B	whereas the other ones they do feel funny when you're not used to them don't they?
A	mm
B	yes I've tried them for walking but I mean they're not ideal cos I just walked round a mile
A	yes
B	it took me five minutes longer because you've got such a weight on your foot haven't you?
A	yes
B	but erm
A	yes that's good
B	yes
A	well what I could do today I think everything in the chest in that spare room
B	okay
A	I'll take some things out of there maybe
B	oh that's fine yes just do it slowly
A	yes
B	because otherwise you'll end up won't you with
A	piles of clothes
A	no
B	yes
A	that's true
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so I've started
A	no
B	cos I can let you you know take whatever you want slowly so I don't spent quite a while in the kitchen that's
A	oh that's good
B	well because it's getting such a muddle cos dad does the shopping but he tends to stockpile he forgets what he's bought
B	so I went up in the cupboards and there's so many different packets of tea
B	we've now got a whole draw of different
A	cor
B	so you don't need to buy any more tea
A	dear
B	yes
A	right mm
B	mm
A	at the supermarket they've got this scan as you go machine in Tesco have you seen those?
B	er
A	scan and shop it's called or something or shop and scan
B	yes I
A	yes I've tried it a couple of times now it's good
B	oh good
A	it does save you time at the end the first time it took forever because I didn't know how to do it
B	ah
A	but yes it was good
B	so what's what happens then? cos I've not
A	well as you go you scan the stuff and put it in bags in your trolley
B	yes
A	so you've already bagged it all
B	okay
A	and then at the end you don't have to take everything out and put it on the conveyor belt
B	oh right
A	you just pay
B	right that's a
A	so it's just on honestly basically
B	really? oh
A	they just assumed you've scanned it all
B	right
A	piles of smoked salmon for all they knew
B	mm yes
A	yeah that's it you just pay at the end
B	ah
A	you just wheel your trolley up but you don't take anything out
B	oh yes
A	yeah it's good
B	mm
A	yeah saved some time
B	no I don't do the shopping cos dad does but I I I
A	yes
B	because you go in there and you enjoy you think oh that looks nice I'll have that and you put it in and you look forward to eating it
A	yes
B	if you don't go through that process it's not the same
A	no
B	but I don't want to take it off him
A	but then I think sometimes it's nice to go through a cookbook in the same way
B	yes that'd be good and I do mean to do that
A	it's not the same on the internet
B	yes I'm always cutting out recipes
A	ah that's good
B	I don't try very many
A	mm yes
B	yes it's lovely
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it's good
B	well it's nice to be settled here isn't it?
A	yes
B	oh
C	you'll have to see what you want there
A	more boxes
B	it's like Christmas
A	dad's found the teddies I think
A	oh dear you don't wanna upset mum
B	no
A	ah
C	that might go in
C	so these would have been packed up when we moved here
A	yeah
C	so that that was packed
A	yes that's right I don't
C	oh grandpa
A	yes
C	you
C	yes
A	that one I don't know where that one's come from
A	this one you said grandpa got me when I was a baby
B	oh you see I'd forgotten he did did he? that's nice
A	oh I called it Stanley well I don't know
C	well that was Tradecraft I'd got you that
A	oh that's Tradecraft
B	oh don't be upset
A	you see this is the trouble you see they've all got stories
C	no no you
B	oh who gave you those?
A	that's nice isn't it?
B	that's a lovely one did I put
C	that's not bad
A	that one's not
C	that's good well perhaps I could
A	I expect you gave one each
B	you might
C	yeah it's terrible
A	I know
A	yes well I'll keep that's from grandma so I'll keep that one and that's I think from that is definitely a present from someone
B	okay that's nice
A	I really
C	you could have a
A	yes I could
A	I think the rest have to go though don't they?
B	I've got all the you know all the dolls that
A	I don't think they're all
B	well I was gonna say I don't know if they well I can't remember
A	give that to the new babies
B	yeah
C	yes
A	recycle some mum
B	oh yes
C	yeah
A	blue rabbit for a boy and a pink rabbit for a girl
C	oh yes they're different ones as well
B	and there's all those
C	that's a nice one
A	oh no I'll keep that one it's small
C	but that's very nice
B	who gave you that one? is that is that grandma?
A	I don't know this is sweet
C	yeah
B	yes
A	I'll keep that one cos it's small
A	and that one
C	take the box
A	no the rest shall we give to charity? these aren't all mine are
C	I don't know
B	no
C	I honestly don't know
B	all those dolls are great grandma's I had on display
A	I know
B	but I don't know what to do if they're in a box I bought a box especially a nice see-through one
A	yes
B	er and they're in the roof space but I can never give them away
A	oh no I don't think you can I thought you had and I was a bit sad
B	no
A	that she'd spent you know years collecting them
B	no
A	yeah
B	erm but
A	hey that's going to the charity shop
C	what do you want with that
B	okay that's fine
C	do you want us to do that?
A	well yes yes
C	are you happy to?
A	is that okay?
B	no that's fine
C	just take the books in
A	and if you want to give them to other people
C	yeah
A	then you can if you want to recycle the rabbits
C	yeah
A	there's no point having millions
C	no
B	I wonder who gave you this one then
A	I know it's nice isn't it?
B	yes
A	I don't remember that one
B	well it sort of rings a bell but I it's a long time ago now isn't it?
A	and that is not mine though
C	it's a bit like the Dulux dog colours
A	yes
B	but nobody's going to if I give it away and it was
A	I don't
A	I know but some of those aren't
C	that was your that was yours
A	that was mine yes Monty I remember Monty
C	yeah Monty I was trying to remember who what he was called
A	that one's not mine
B	oh right
A	I don't know why that one's there the rabbits are
B	they look very nice
A	very nice yes
B	yeah it was a long time ago though
A	yes
B	little
A	dear
B	I see
A	I know I saw that
B	yeah because I she asked me for one
A	yes
B	erm and as so I sent her a few I had ages ago cos of some sort of competition at work and she she didn't like them I think that's was when she was depressed and
A	mm I think she's quite sentimental isn't she?
B	is she? yeah
A	I think so well the fact she wanted all her childhood things that's quite
B	well yeah I suppose that's true
A	sentimental isn't it?
B	yes
A	or homesick
B	anyway she had them all there and I was looking at them and I don't know what I
B	so I've had two or three replies
B	so I've deleted it now you didn't see it
A	no I didn't see it no
A	no
B	you can easily upset people with Facebook couldn't you? I mean you look you think if
B	and they've decided to be mean or they just think it's nice and send it round
A	yes
B	very nice
A	that's right
B	that was a nice picture on the walk
A	yes they were good weren't they? they came out well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yes it's good you sent a message to him as well
A	yes well he'd organised an
B	no yeah
A	he said he'd just joined the group himself but no one was organising anything so he did he said he'd be going out anyway
B	ah
A	yes yes I just thought that was nice cos he was
B	yes
A	you know didn't have to do that did he?
B	no I thought that was a nice sized group cos that walking group I've joined I'm not gonna go very often
A	yes
B	but it's far too big I think twenty people on a walk you know you see people out don't you? these big rambling groups
A	yes not the same
A	no it was a nice group and we didn't have to wait around for people
B	yes
A	so that was good
B	where did you meet them? in
A	no so they'd met in
B	it was before the suspension bridge yeah that's it
A	so I wrote to him cos he put a note about message me
B	yes
B	mm
A	and I'll tell you exactly where
B	yes
A	right so message me on Friday night so I did and he told me the name of the car park
B	okay
A	erm and just said google it but I looked on my OS map and it was there
B	yes
A	so I just went there and they were there so that was good
B	okay
A	I googled oh I didn't even google I just went on Facebook and put in
B	ah
A	you there's a search bar isn't there?
B	yes
A	where it says search for people but you can also use it to search for groups
B	oh can you?
A	so if you put in like
B	mm
A	it's quite clever I found a lot through that
B	oh did you? that that's very good
A	or Google as well sometimes
B	well yes
A	yes so I found that one cos a few months ago I started looking cos I knew I was moving
B	mm
A	so I just started searching and then if I found things on Facebook I just joined them
B	oh right
A	so that they I knew what was happening
B	oh yes
A	so like the
B	oh did you? yeah
A	but it's quite useful cos then I knew
B	yes
A	what was there what clubs what was happening
B	mm
A	just a bit easier
A	no
B	with you know cos there's things there aren't they?
A	right
B	so these groups where anybody can go along it's good isn't it?
A	yes
B	mm
A	it's not costing me money so that's nice
B	yes no
B	do you think there'll be another one?
A	I think that's going to be quite disorganised
B	right
A	by the look of it but
B	but you might not mind that if you're busy
A	no exactly so I don't know how often I'll be able to go though
B	well that's
A	cos if it's unlucky that
B	yeah
A	if they do a walk on the weekend where I'm doing my course then I won't be able to go and then that might be it for six weeks
B	is that the same group that went to
A	this is the
A	so that was unusual cos they did two in a row
B	oh right okay
A	apparently that was awful really badly organised
B	was it?
A	it was said seven miles
B	oh
A	but it was ten and they got lost and
B	oh dear
A	it was really muddy and people didn't have the right footwear
B	uhu
A	that group seems quite disorganised
B	oh yes
A	they said last year they had to call a helicopter out on
B	really?
A	cos someone had a heart attack in the group and
B	mm
A	actually knew they had a heart problem but didn't bother to tell anybody
C	oh dear
A	er yeah so now they put this huge disclaimer next to the walk by clicking on accept you are accepting all responsibility
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	we accept no responsibility for your health if you turn up with the wrong footwear it's nothing to do with us
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but they have to I mean he could have sued that man couldn't he?
C	cos people complained
B	I know it's it's worrying what what it's like for people to running anything isn't it today?
A	there was a solicitor in the group yesterday and she said it's a really good disclaimer because it even says by clicking accept you accept these accept the invitation you are accepting the following conditions
C	yeah
B	mm
A	which is good
B	no no that's right
A	be qualified and carry all this extra equipment
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	in case and
B	yes
A	yeah that man was silly wasn't he? he should have told somebody he had a heart condition
C	yeah
B	yes
A	and obviously they would have told him
B	yes
A	in bad weather
B	it's good
A	yeah
B	with that one person
A	yes there was a nice lady yesterday actually
B	oh was there?
A	a German lady but she's been here about
B	yes
A	she seemed very nice and she said she hasn't been out at all the last two years
B	really?
A	she got divorced and was
B	ah
A	very upset about it and she's got two children
B	ah
A	but she said now her ex-husband had the children every other week
B	oh yes
A	but she's just been at home those last two years on those weeks
B	has she? oh yeah
A	but she decided
B	yeah
A	so that was good
B	yes
A	yes
B	oh did they?
A	and I said yes but you have to I said moving back to the UK is the same as moving to another country
C	yeah oh yeah
A	or moving anywhere in the UK is pretty much like moving abroad
B	is different
A	you have to go through the same
B	process
A	process
C	yeah
A	of joining a lot of things
B	yes I think so
A	and you may or may not like them but
B	yes
A	you're meeting people all the time
B	yeah and you you need to stick at them till you feel safe I think
C	yeah
A	yes
B	yes
A	ah yes
B	and
A	oh
B	and they're all over the country and the health visitor told me to go to and I went to
A	yeah
B	I mean it was worth it cos I joined it in two different moves and both times I met somebody
A	yes well that's good
B	from it and then I thought well I won't go to the group any more
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes no it was good
B	yes
A	yes you're outdoors
B	yes
A	yes
B	yes there's lots of benefits aren't there?
A	yes
C	yeah
B	so
A	it's a twenty minute drive but on little lanes
B	okay
A	miles probably seven miles I would have thought
B	okay
A	I don't think you're quite high enough
B	oh
A	you can see the cliffs at
B	oh can you?
A	someone showed me them but I couldn't see the sea
B	yes
A	maybe you can though on a good day
B	you've got all that coastline to explore in the summer
A	mm
B	I quite you know I like Devon and Dorset coast along there
A	yes and there's a nice I saw on the map there's a
A	and there's a footpath all the way
B	oh is there?
A	north almost to the A thirty
B	oh right okay
A	that might be quite nice to do
B	oh yes
A	yes and nice pubs along the way
B	mm yes
A	as well around there saw some nice pubs
B	cos last time I did the
A	mm
B	the coastal walk on my own
B	there on that path sort of northwards
A	oh yes yes looks nice
B	yes
A	yes
C	really?
B	oh yes
A	yeah it's all S S S I round there
C	oh
B	it's a bit
A	oh right it's got the tram hasn't it
B	yes yes
C	it has a tram
B	you can go on it but I had a really nice bed and breakfast there
A	yes that's quite nice
B	and then
A	yes
B	but
A	yes
B	trouble is I've seen so much I can't remember where half the places probably are now
C	oh no
A	cos I thought oh they haven't sent me the letter this year every year they send me a letter saying you have to fill in your tax return and I thought well they didn't send it this year so that means I don't have to do it because last year the year before I actually didn't earn anything here
C	no cos the marking
A	because I did the no I didn't do the marking cos I was in Spain doing that course so I actually didn't do any marking so I put in zero zero zero zero for the whole year and I thought oh that's why they haven't sent it to me
C	yeah
A	this year because they've worked out I'm not earning anything
C	yeah
A	it's typical of them
C	that's no help
A	so the deadline in the thirty-first of January or I get fined
C	oh really?
A	so I filled it all in last night but I didn't have
C	Timbuktu
A	Timbuktu if they're open and told them they said they'll send it in the post so it will come here
C	oh right cos that's where your bank
A	well I've closed that account now but that's what they've got as the last address
C	yeah
A	so when you see it could you open it please?
C	so it'll say
A	well I hope so but often they don't do they now?
C	no they don't identify
A	they're just white envelopes so can you just keep an eye on the post? they said seven working days
C	and open it?
A	yes and maybe just take a photograph
C	yeah I'll photo it
A	it'll be net
C	yeah yeah
A	yes just a photo's fine
C	photo and send it
A	cos I need to get that done
C	and email it?
A	as soon as possible
C	well
A	well I've got to get it done by the thirty-first otherwise I'll get fined
C	and they said that the
A	it's better than getting fined
C	they said they'd send it in seven within seven days
A	seven working days
C	so it's probably not huge
A	oh it's tiny yes
C	yeah
A	I mean it's nothing it's just for in case they go through it
C	yeah
A	and say where is the paperwork?
C	mm
B	mm hm
A	yes very annoying they don't tell you you've got mail there
C	yeah
A	how are you supposed to know?
C	yeah
A	there doesn't even I mean I can understand they don't want to send the email
C	no
A	they could just send an email saying you have got
C	an alert
A	a secure message
C	yeah
A	mm mm
B	oh did they? oh that's quite
A	I said no I'm not doing A level this year
C	what's
A	I did it the last two years and it was awful
B	was it?
A	it's just ridiculous trying to read it on this you can only get it half the screen cos of their software and it's sixteen pages of that
B	oh right
A	and you have to go back and forwards
B	mm
A	it wasn't well paid GCSE pays less
B	no
A	but you can do it a lot faster
B	ah right
C	yeah
A	because they're short answers so sometimes they're
B	yes
A	I mean with GCSE you're often only looking for keywords
B	mm
A	and if they've got the keywords you don't read the rest you just give them the full marks
B	yes
A	they've got it it doesn't matter
C	mm
A	but with A level it's all in the detail
B	mm
A	and in the facts and
C	what subject was that?
A	geography
C	oh right
A	and it was the research paper
B	mm
A	yeah I'd and I you know you're supposed to cross reference it all you know blah blah blah says this how do I know?
B	mm
A	to cross reference things I'm not going to do it I'll I
B	oh yes
A	but mostly it's just annoying with the the screens
C	mm
A	trying to read an essay like that
C	yeah
B	mm
A	a third of the page on each one
B	yeah
A	I just didn't like it
B	well it's good you've got the GCSE
A	well I haven't yet but I I'm sure they will cos last year they were obviously very understaffed cos they
C	yes
A	saying will you take on another contract?
B	oh right okay
A	hopefully they will
B	you know I hope you're gonna have your job for at university
A	yes
B	erm you know next year as well
A	and there's a pension with that which is good
B	oh oh that's good
A	I pay one percent and they pay one percent I can also up it
B	ah that's good
A	and tell them I want I think up to four percent and they'll match it or something
B	so you haven't got a pension at the moment have you?
A	no I need to look into that
B	no so that's good
A	I need to write to
B	yes so that's good then
A	National Insurance and find out if I can pay missing years
B	yes
C	yeah
A	they used to let you
C	yeah
A	I dunno if they still do you'd think they would wouldn't you?
C	they'd probably be there'll be a scheme
A	it'd be a bit silly if they didn't
C	yeah
B	yes
A	wasn't worth it
B	it wasn't worth it no because you're younger it'd be different
A	yes
B	yes
A	even if it's hundreds
B	yes
A	a couple of thousand
B	yes
A	or more it's probably still worth it
B	yes
A	yes I need to find out about that
B	yes it's really good so soon cos if you can keep that job at
A	yes
B	and yet
A	and they're flexible most people aren't
B	the rest is
A	they're not full time there most people they're working elsewhere and they're okay about that
B	oh are they?
A	so if you found better paid work in
B	yes
A	that's
B	oh right
A	another job two days a week
B	oh right
A	and they're on like point six or point eight
B	yes
A	and they college they don't mind
B	that's good isn't it?
B	mm yes
A	so that's
C	yeah
B	yes
C	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
B	will you think about going back to the place you were at at this last summer?
A	no
B	no
A	no I won't go back there
B	no okay
A	there's no point really
B	no
A	not for the money cos I'd be on almost the same money at
C	okay yes
B	ah yes of course
A	yes
B	mm
A	and have the weekends free
C	yes
A	and
B	what do they pay there then?
A	eight hundred a week
B	do they?
A	that's one of the best in the country though cos I looked
B	really? that's very good
A	but they they start hiring early I need to start looking from next month
B	and will that be like two or three month's work?
A	could be
B	okay
A	no that's the thing
C	no
A	but I need to work it out carefully
B	no
A	better off
B	mm
A	cos right now I'm employed till the twenty-second of April
B	yes
C	ah yes
A	but you see
C	yeah yeah
A	so then I'm
C	yeah
B	mm
A	but I'd have to work it out it might not it might work out that the pay is so good somewhere like
B	yes
B	mm
A	and saying I'm gonna have my month's holiday early
B	ah yes
A	cos you're not getting an August holiday are you?
B	mm
A	yes if I worked somewhere else you mean?
A	yes
B	that money
A	yeah well I suppose you don't know do you?
C	no
B	no
A	it's but then if I wouldn't be losing money anyway
B	no
A	if they're paying my accommodation in
C	no
A	cos I'm not
B	yes
A	paying rent in
B	no
C	no
A	so it's it's exactly the same actually
C	and if they
A	leaving the house
C	oh if they put accommodation in yes
B	mm
A	yes
B	then if you if you're letting the house out as well as going to
A	yes
B	you wouldn't definitely know
C	no no
B	no
A	you would fill it
B	mm you might not want
C	no
A	no
B	no
A	it'd have to be fully furnished wouldn't it?
B	mm
A	yes
A	now
B	mm
A	what are you doing this week?
B	I
A	ah that's good
B	but erm they're not
C	mm
B	I'm not doing them every day
A	mm
B	so somebody came last week and wanted to do singing as well as a piano lesson
A	yes
A	mm
B	it's good
A	yes that's good
B	this week we're going to grandpa's
A	yes
B	but there's tennis
A	yes
B	then Wednesdays
A	yes
B	erm
A	yes quieter now
C	mm
B	you can't be bothered almost
A	no
A	that's good
B	and yours is the same isn't it really?
C	yeah I've got
B	well may
C	yes
A	yes
C	and then I've got
A	oh dear
C	donation
A	dear
C	that's okay
A	that's quite busy
C	mm
A	two days
C	I've got Tuesday and Wednesday free
A	oh yeah
B	and in my late middle age
A	yes
B	like Thursday I could just get up and not have no plan at all just potter around
A	yeah
B	that doesn't happen very often
A	mm right
B	it's very therapeutic though isn't it?
A	yes it is
B	if if if you have a day completely out I think
A	mm
A	yes that's true
B	cos I think once the weather gets better you feel like doing a bit more
A	yes
B	yeah it is there's a lot before Christmas
A	hm
B	yes so I hope I find grandpa's house has dried out a bit more downstairs
A	I know
B	ah
A	can't next weekend cos I've got the course
B	no
A	so the weekend after
B	yes perhaps he'd like that
A	maybe mention it put it on the board
B	yes what date would you think?
A	well it would be Saturday or Sunday
B	well
A	no no no leave leave it as it is
B	yeah
A	so I'll go Saturday
B	alright I'll put that on the board then so two weeks
A	yes
A	oh good yes
B	I was hoping you might
A	yes
B	cos he had actually a quiet Christmas really compared to normal
A	yes
B	because you were the only one out of the grandchildren that was here
A	yes it was funny wasn't it? it was
B	it it was strange I
A	well he's had this thing with the
B	yes and they've been ill
A	yes exactly
B	they could have gone after Christmas they
A	yes it was quieter
B	yeah and then actually from this side properly people don't normally come here
A	yes
B	so it was particularly quiet
A	yes
B	yes
A	yes
B	yes well he'll look forward to that
A	oh yes
B	I expect he will I expect he will it's nicer for him I think
A	yes
B	that's kind of you
A	yes you can ask him what he wants to do
B	yes
A	twelve
B	yes that's a good time isn't it?
A	yes
B	it won't take you too long to get there should be about an hour and it should be the same as coming here
A	ah right oh that's okay
B	yes
A	try not to get lost
B	yes well
A	yes
B	you've got good roads anyway
B	er it is over the moor yes
A	yes
B	they wouldn't go with that one cos it's so slow
A	ah right so go to
B	along the A thirty to
A	ah right then turn off
B	yes
B	so are you getting used to being back in the country now?
A	yes
B	how does it feel? cos it must be so different after all these years away
A	well
B	oh do they?
A	phase
B	ah
A	there's cos I learnt all about it with this course I just did
B	oh right okay
A	the the workshop
B	yes
A	and now when you come back you're initially in a honeymoon phase where you
B	ah yes
A	because you all the things you missed
B	yes
A	will be obvious to you so and then there's things that are different like the weather that you appreciate and things like that so I'm still in that phase
B	okay
A	and then after that they say that will wear off
B	yes
A	and then actually you can feel a bit down
B	ah right it's interesting to know
A	and then you pick up but yes the first
B	ah
A	it's all new and you're busy as well aren't you?
B	yes
A	so
B	but you've at least got the summer then well it's well it's well it's that's quite good
A	yes I was saying that to people they said oh you've come at the worst time of year I said not really actually because
B	not by
A	you've got something to look forward to
B	yes
A	and you're busy at first so
B	yes
A	by the time I get to that point where you know the novelty's worn off
B	yes
A	then we've got the nicer weather coming
B	yes
A	so actually I think it's a good time of year to be back
B	so you're fine with it though
A	yes
B	that's good
A	so that's good
B	I can remember coming back from Africa
A	yes
B	and it was I mean I had two years out in the bush and it was a very quiet night and I loved it it was really good
A	mm
A	yes
B	cos I had been living on a very low income
A	mm
B	and then I did adjust but then we moved to London with dad for his job but he was in London and I went there as well and that was
A	yes
B	from being out in the bush then I what two months later going round London and
A	yes so it was probably more of a change for you
A	yes for me I suppose
B	yes
A	but there's actually quite a lot going on here that I want to do
B	yes that's good you've got
A	that's good it's not there's loads going on it's just it's things that I like doing isn't it?
B	yes
A	so there's plenty of outdoors groups
B	yes that's good
A	erm the university's quite a good place to work cos there'll be things going on there
B	so it's better is it
A	all the time
B	mm
A	so that's good cos I do that anyway go to talks and things
B	used to before
A	yes
B	yes
A	in Abu Dhabi I went
B	yes
A	so that's yes
B	yes
A	yes
B	I think that's
A	yes
B	whereas the person who's at home you've gotta think oh you know
A	yes that's right they said that about you know the couple
B	ah right
A	that is more difficult for the wives
B	ah right
A	much more difficult
B	yeah
A	and in a way the husband is protected by the corporate culture which won't be that different
B	yes
A	to working at home
B	mm
A	you know it's the same rules isn't it?
B	yes
A	so they're not learning a whole lot of new rules again
B	no no
A	they were and they've got that structure
B	mm
A	but for the wives there's no structure
B	no no
A	and
A	they've got all this time to fill each day
B	very difficult
A	yes and if you're not into that anyway
B	no
A	cos I asked the lady
B	oh dear
A	what do you think you'll do?
A	I know
B	oh
A	she's gonna come home quite a lot but in way that can make it difficult to settle
B	to settle
A	yeah I think three years quite a long time three years
B	yes
A	yes I think she needs to think
B	yeah
A	and there's only so much shopping you can do she said she likes shopping but I mean even if you go
B	yes
A	three hours a day I mean
B	yes
A	it's not that's not even half the day isn't it?
B	yes
A	mm
B	to start with it's like a honeymoon going over that
A	yes
B	and now she's been there a bit longer I mean she sounds fine but she doesn't do very much
A	no and she's gone quiet cos she used to email me quite a lot and it's gone quiet
B	ah she has gone quiet so that that could be part of it
A	so it's a bit like
B	yes
A	mm
B	so she I mean the email sounded bright and cheerful but all she seemed to be doing was going to the pool and the gym well
A	yeah
B	she's got friends
A	yes and she was working before so it was different
B	yes yes that's it it would be very different
A	mm
B	but maybe it's not for long?
A	no
B	well that's it we don't know if
A	yeah
B	or if she's not well with the treatment don't know do you?
A	no
A	mm
B	well the last time I saw spoke to her she and that was
A	oh right
B	yes I think so
A	mm
B	because it does terrible things to you doesn't it?
A	that's basically poison isn't it?
B	yes
A	I know
B	and then what was she doing about work? because she seems to be doing hardly any work when I spoke to her
A	I don't think she's
B	I don't know cos she
A	well she told you actually to she was getting insurance money
B	she told me that she was trying to take a pension out
A	yes well I think she's got it
B	right
A	so in that sense financially she must be fine
B	yes
A	well
A	yeah I think she's got to think about the next twenty years not the next
B	right
A	plan a bit shorter time hasn't she?
B	I suppose I suppose so I suppose to be realistic yes
A	she's better off thinking about the next ten
B	yes
A	years
B	yes
A	cos at the end of the day if you were really destitute aged sixty the government's got no choice but to help you
B	well I was gonna say surely you've got this
A	so it's the people in between who suffer isn't it?
B	yes
A	the people who have some money
B	yes
A	and then the government won't help you cos they say look you've got all this equity and you could sell your house
B	yes
A	the people who are best off are those who are either comfortably well off
B	yes
A	and have the pension
B	mm
A	and the government must help you
B	yes
A	so she shouldn't worry
B	no
A	yes
B	half the rent anyway
A	yes
B	yeah so we don't know how she is at the moment
A	no
B	I sent an email
A	ah right
C	it's getting lighter a bit each day isn't it?
A	yes it's a bit better isn't it? what time is it now? four o'clock yes a bit better
B	would you like another cup of tea?
A	I would and I wouldn't mind looking for my wellingtons could we go and have a look for those?
C	ah yes
B	alright
B	mm my box
A	yes can you please remember I'll send you a text about the HSBC
C	oh yes please send a text
A	yes they didn't come but it could be
C	yeah
A	what and I'll just tell them I made a mistake if they're ever
C	yes
A	they usually don't I mean it really is going to be a couple of pounds they don't normally
A	ah yeah
A	ah
B	size forty?
A	well I don't know about forty
C	hello?
A	hello?

B	ah I see
A	that
B	and
A	oh thank you
A	lovely that's nice
C	were they green ones?
A	but
B	I'll have a quick whip though shall I in a minute for you?
C	mm
A	mm
C	they'll be in the front room probably
A	mm
C	that's I think that's where the waterproof jacket is
A	yes there's a waterproof jacket which is not mine
C	what a green one?
A	mm
C	wasn't yours green?
A	no my waterproof jacket I have
C	yeah
A	it's blue
C	oh yes
A	ah yes trapped
B	is that waterproof jacket the one I gave you
A	yeah
B	is it is it
A	no not entirely
B	I was gonna say
A	no that green one's probably better
B	yes
C	have you got a blue one?
A	yeah mum gave me it
B	yes it was
C	oh yes that's them yes
A	yeah
B	yes
C	er there's one just inside the roof space at the top of the big
A	mm yes
C	a a sort of sky blue colour
A	oh I don't know whose that is?
C	or no it's got more of a thickness to it
A	oh yes it's a ski jacket that is mine
C	ah
A	but that's not really suitable for walking
C	no no
A	not long distance cos it's hot
C	too heavy
B	well do you want to borrow that green one?
A	is that your what one there? two?
B	and there's two I think one of them is mine which I
A	yes one of them is yours yeah
B	yeah but you could have it then cos I'm not
A	oh okay thank you mm
B	yes
A	that will be useful
B	okay
A	it is yeah you bought two identical ones
B	yes
A	one's yours and one's
B	and your and your upset because you didn't get one
A	I never got one
B	no
A	yes it's fine just for work
B	yes
A	get wet
A	yes I did get quite wet yesterday
B	well I was gonna say that it isn't
C	yeah
B	really a walking
B	we bought them for when we were going on cruises and we're in
A	yes they're good I mean they're fine in a shower
B	in the Mediterranean there's a shower and we can have it in our little rucksack cos
A	yes they're good cos they fold up very small
B	oh
C	oh for a shower
A	mm
C	if
B	yes
C	that's you know cos it's between
B	yes
C	but if you're actually erm like sightseeing but if you're actually out on a Dartmoor type walk
A	yeah
C	where you're all exposed for three hours then
B	mm
C	and there's no there won't be any warmth to it
A	yes I I tested that yesterday and it was
A	no I didn't get soaked it did stay waterproof for quite a long time
B	well that's not bad for
C	yeah
A	and I didn't get that wet but I did get wet
C	yes
A	in the end
B	while we were looking for curtains the only thing dad found but I told him it
C	boring
C	off white
A	yeah
B	but there always seem to be well I suppose they are the right person to get entangled up
B	do you want those
A	well probably not unless I bought the fabric in which case
C	yeah
B	yes
C	no then it won't fit yeah
A	no that's true
B	but it's gonna be interesting sorting out the roof space cos we came here and just you know gave away a lot of things so we had far too much of our own things
C	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah but you know we've got things up near our house we don't want so
C	not much
B	no
C	there's not much of ours up there
B	no
A	who knows what's up there?
B	there's a things like
C	yes
C	that's that's in recent years it's not that incredibly old
B	yes and there's a few of my things that
C	yeah

B	no
A	that's not mine

A	yes
B	there was a couple of your things I think
A	yes I just took them out but it is it was literally a couple
B	yes
C	yeah a couple yeah
A	it's like three shirts and one jumper so there's nothing of mine in there
C	yeah
B	yes
A	at the bottom
B	mm
A	and then that chest mostly my things in
B	oh yes
A	and the chest of drawers the
B	middle yes
A	the bottom's empty
B	mm
A	and the top is not
C	yes
B	it's not very
A	mm
B	cos we came to such a big house didn't we?

C	mm
B	mm yes
C	and are those
A	upstairs?
C	yeah
A	in my house?
