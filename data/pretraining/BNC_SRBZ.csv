A	erm
B	we'll have to buy you one of those clocks have you seen the clocks where er er every so there are twelve different bird songs so at
A	mm
B	on the hour at one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock
A	mm
B	then you will get a different bird tweeting and it's like a
A	and does it tell you what it is?
B	erm I haven't investigated cos I haven't
A	yeah yeah
B	but erm yeah we'll have to investigate yeah I I presume I presume certainly if it it'll tell you when you get with the instructions of the box you'll get you know at one o'clock you will hear I presume and I think there are also pictures on the face
A	right
A	I'm looking very dubious though cos I can imagine it keeping me awake all night
B	well you'd have to have it in here always
A	yeah but I sleep with with I normally have that door open cos I get up from time to time and get a drink of water or something so
B	mm
A	that wouldn't necessarily stop me hearing it
B	ah right no that that might not be a good idea
A	put it this way
B	mm
A	so
B	erm
A	I guess
B	where you can actually set it for eight thirty-six whatever because at the moment I'm the alarm clock I've got I mean it wakes me up vaguely when I want to be woken up
A	mm
B	but I can't put it to quarter
A	mobile
B	well or ten past eight or quarter to eight
A	I use my mobile
B	oh right okay
A	which is why I haven't bothered to replace the clock
B	mm
A	I mean I want I like to have I like to know what I always wake up in the night at least once often two or three times and I like to know what time it is and the only way I can do it at the moment is to switch the light on and look at me watch
B	mm well I mean mine ticks you didn't hear mine did you through the wall?
A	mm
B	cos it you do hear it you do hear it but I mean mine's good because it's it's luminous and so you know you wake up in the night and you do know what time it is without switching the lights on and stuff but as I say it it you can't make to sort of
A	no no
B	accuracy and sometimes in the morning if I'm going out and catching you know six thirty train five minutes actually makes quite a difference in the middle of the night
A	mm yes mm mm
B	you know erm so
A	mm
B	alarm clock and that's what she's buying me so she hasn't no I can't what else do you want? so
A	mm see you know the light of a digital one also irritates me
B	mm hm
A	I
B	that's what mine's like that's what mine that's what got mm
A	yes that's fine yeah erm but but an actual digital one it it actually glows and you can even if you turn it round you can still see the glow
B	oh right
A	erm
B	I don't think that'll put me off
A	but I don't I don't think that you can well I think you're right with an analogue one that you can't be that accurate with with the alarm unfortunately
B	mm no and as I say normally it really doesn't matter but it's just if I have early mornings and if I do the
A	mm
B	and they like to have it before work so that's eight o'clock
A	mm
B	so I have to be there like quarter to eight so it means getting a half past six train more or less and and then you really don't want to be woken up ten minutes more than more than necessary
A	no no
B	yeah
A	mm
B	oh right and
A	mm
B	he uses his his digital
A	and obviously you can set that to a precise minute
B	yeah his his phone as a as an alarm
A	and it's not okay you get this voice going the
A	it's time to get up the time is seven
A	you know
B	ah
A	the whatever you get it's some kind of noise
B	yeah we just set the
A	you could probably actually change what it does anyway I mean I haven't I haven't investigated that but if you can change the ringtone I would imagine you can change the alarm noise as well
B	and if you can and if you can turn your satnav to an Australian an Australian male instead of a instead of a British female
A	mm exactly so
B	er
A	anyway I mean if you're getting one from
B	yeah
A	but if if you don't get one I would investigate that
B	yeah oh yeah
A	oh right
B	and we obviously missed out a complete series
A	right
B	but we've obviously missed out erm a whole series so he said well he wanted series X of Lewis
A	mm
B	so it was very easy to tell her
A	mm
B	she was she was like you know ecstatic that
A	help yourself
B	yep
A	yep
B	right yours'll be in the post
A	it is yes
A	erm
B	and did you buy them from the from the meeting or did you get them online?
A	I bought them from the meeting
B	mm
A	erm because you're not paying postage then
B	true
A	erm and in fact if you want something big she will get it for you and because she's getting a lot of stuff she's not paying postage so that doesn't then that doesn't the cost doesn't get passed onto the
B	right
A	customer so
B	mm
A	it just makes sense at any time if I want something from them to order it from her
B	and is the person who did the seed and stuff is she a member of the RSPB?
A	no er not as far as I know
B	mm
A	she's just a friend of
B	oh I see
A	and the
B	cos I mean it's quite a good idea but some people might get a bit you know well annoyed that you've got some sort of commercial thing going on that's not RSPB I don't I mean it wouldn't worry me
A	well well as I say we used to she used to do the actual the seed from the
B	mm
A	erm
B	okay yeah
A	so I think it's something that the RSPB would approve of in other words
B	yeah
A	even though it's not actually their stuff
B	mm
A	so we said well we'll give it a try
B	well when I was waiting for you for the meeting to start there were people behind me talking
A	mm
B	and saying oh this is a good idea cos they have big sacks and they can order and so obviously they were happy
A	mm
B	you know and I would imagine they were not the only ones
A	I don't know I can't remember what the what we
B	yeah yeah
A	well
B	oh right
A	if if money doesn't keep coming in they don't sort of have lots of investments and things they the money that comes in gets used very quickly
B	are you supposed to feed birds the whole year?
A	mm
B	yeah?
A	mm
B	I mean
A	that is actually really a crucial time cos it's when they're feeding their young
B	oh right yeah
A	and they've done
B	that's why my sister was so annoyed
A	yes
B	because when on the day there was the count there were no sparrows and the next day she said you know she had lots in her garden
A	well they'd done studies of sparrows in urban settings where
B	oh right uhu
A	erm which would suggest that we're just erm spraying all our flowers to get rid of the insects or something and they're not getting the protein at the time that they need it I don't know
B	mm
A	they're not getting what they what they need
B	in the trees right at the bottom?
A	I don't know where the nest was
B	uhu
A	but they were coming to my feeder cos I put food out and for
B	yeah
A	erm and even after they'd the the mum had stopped coming with them I was getting the four babies all you know for for quite a few weeks they knew this is where we can get food and and as far as I know all four survived you know at least
B	mm
A	er and blue tits I can't remember how many baby blue tits there were but I'd actually learnt the to recognise the difference between adult and and a baby because they do look different
B	and
A	well
A	I learnt a great tits call cos it's a it's a quite an irritating sort of two-tone squeak
A	and I was sitting
B	who you were talking who you were talking to
A	yes he's a warden at
B	you don't have to say what it is?
A	yes you do
B	oh
A	erm this is what I'm saying he's going right I'm
B	I don't know how you count either
A	well that was a I mean he was trying to teach us how to count and
B	you know I mean when you're when when you see on
A	erm
B	erm and they say you know there are thirty thousand and I think well okay you know they're saying about thirty thousand but I don't know how you even say there are about thirty thousand
A	no
B	I wouldn't have a clue I just think there's lots of birds
A	yes erm I don't know how you count those sort of numbers cos we weren't seeing any anything like as big as that erm he was sort of
B	mm
A	you know sort of well that's
B	mm
A	and his wife sort of writing things down could you pass the butter please?
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but I just found it impossible I was standing there being interested but I really wasn't contributing to the counting because I just couldn't watch things moving about like that
B	I don't think I would be able to look up that long
A	well
B	I get dizzy
A	that's that is also a problem yes you get dizzy and you get backache
B	because
A	mm
B	because because of looking up
A	yes yes well that's why I got
A	cos I thought I would just fall I
B	mm mm
A	but in the middle of the room no
B	no
A	erm
B	and I I was very glad I'd finished it and I was okay cos a friend of mine's just cracked three ribs er not painting the kitchen but erm cleaning you know on top of cupboards and various things and she fell
A	mm oh dear
B	and er
A	that did you try that? that's the quince
B	yes it's very good
A	you see I think it's too sweet
B	no I quite like it but then I am I have got a sweet tooth
A	well I have got a sweet tooth but I like jam to have flavour I don't like strawberry jam because it just doesn't it's too sweet and it doesn't really taste of very much
B	I don't like strawberry jam because when I was a kid I had a huge tablet and the doctors asked me to erm swallow this on strawberry jam
A	mm
B	if they'd given me water I'd have swallowed it happily but the strawberry jam I gagged on it and do you know for years I couldn't eat strawberry jam without gagging and of course grandma's always give you strawberry jam don't they?
A	erm
B	when when you when you come to tea well with my grandma's
B	when you go to tea you you got strawberry jam
A	mine gave me fish and chips I don't remember the strawberry jam
B	and and my mum was the sort of mum who said well you know they've gone to a lot of trouble
A	yes
B	eat it
A	yes my mother would have
B	you know eat it but eat it just a little bit you know
A	yes
B	so I used to spread it very thinly but
B	I'm okay now I can eat strawberry jam now but I don't enjoy strawberry jam that oh oh dear you you don't look as though you're gonna be able to walk
A	no damn it
B	is there something they feed on that's not round here?
A	I don't know erm I just I mean if you go for a walk you see lots and they do come to feeders when I was in Scotland last year that was it was chaffinches and siskins which you don't get out
B	siskins I wouldn't know at all
A	erm and and tits but I mean
B	and is that very similar to a chaffinch?
A	it no but it it's a similar there are they're all a similar sort of you know small birds is what we're talking about no they're sort of greenish yellowish
B	mm no idea
A	erm
B	mm
A	that looks like a good
B	yeah it is
A	oh are you very deficient
B	mm
A	if you're not full feel free to eat that erm
B	I'm fine no
B	I've actually got to remember not to take aspirin as from Monday
A	right
B	cos my I'm having my teeth out
A	oh right oh
B	cos they're you know blood thinners
A	mm yeah I see what you mean cos I was trying to work out does aspirin react with anaesthetic or something but so you having two local anaesthetics on your teeth on different sides and you just won't be able to talk even would ya?
B	no no
A	really?
B	mm
A	mm
B	but the top one it'll be a digging
A	oh dear
B	sort of
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I didn't have to stop
A	oh
B	I didn't have to stop taking aspirins so don't ask me
A	well
B	that was when I actually went to the cardiologist
A	mm
B	and they said go and talk to him
A	mm
B	we won't do it until you've talked to the cardiologist and he tells us what you're supposed to do
A	mm
B	and he said no it's alright
A	well
A	possibly if you went and talked to the cardiologist he would say it doesn't matter
B	yeah yeah of course
A	erm
B	yeah
A	well
B	because I mean you don't have in you don't have in the on the television you don't have
A	mm
B	erm if you have a problem come and phone us and people think they don't you know no win no fee
A	mm
B	no no no
A	mm
A	on the other hand if it was okay for your gallbladder it probably will be if you don't remember just lie if she asks you a question
B	mm
A	so you're the one who's taking those tablets but
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he didn't have one the day after he went to the doctors and he they cauterised the erm one nostril
A	mm
B	erm so maybe it is just a weakness of the
A	mm
B	blood vessels in his nose or but he does blow hard when he blows his nose you really hear it through the whole flat
B	erm so I think he has to be a bit more gentle with himself
A	mm
B	he's got to go back
A	mm
B	I don't think he'll I hope it doesn't happen before we go away
A	yeah
A	mm yeah it was happening I remember
B	mm
A	but as I say I was lucky it just stopped again
B	mine just stopped I had them regularly when I was a child and I mean you know not
A	mm
B	and then it would stop and then I would be asleep and it would start again
A	mm
B	I can remember mum putting ice cubes on my neck
A	yeah
B	to stop it and it was awful but and I don't know I must have been I don't know ten eleven and then it just stopped
A	mm well I went to the doctor when I was a kid a teenager I can't remember
A	erm so fair enough erm and it's horrible like because you're swallowing the blood
B	I know
A	it makes you feel sick erm you know but that is not what you're supposed to do and in fact if you do if you do what you are supposed to do it usually does clear up fairly quickly but
B	and you get a huge great clot out of your nose
A	mm
B	that was a horrible bit of it as well
A	mm yeah
B	in Chinese?
A	no no no in English
A	in Hong Kong this is in the days when Hong Kong was was British erm
B	mm well
A	but it works
B	mm
A	and I put I just
B	yes please
A	ah
B	with with milk please
A	oh right
B	I assume nobody ever takes sugar in coffee cos I don't
B	yeah
A	yes that's definitely a great tit that I'm seeing now
B	it's it's behaving itself now is it?
A	yes
B	it's looking into the camera watch the birdie
A	well I've got some the thing that I've got in a squirrel proof thing is sunflower kernels and they really go for those and they always go in the far side
B	oh yeah
A	seems so many it's very difficult to see what it is when it does that
A	erm
B	did you ever come to our house in
A	yes twice
B	oh of course you did cos you helped put up the the famous tent
A	yes
B	well we had a we used to have erm a woodpecker there
A	right
B	used to come
A	well they're just so was that is that
B	mm yeah
A	cos they're so spectacular aren't they?
B	yeah very very
A	the first time I saw one what is that? wow it would come more or less the same time every day
B	yeah
A	for several weeks
B	and the other bird we had in our garden was jays
A	yes
B	they're spectacular too
A	yeah I know I have had those this year I've had a pair er actually coming to the feeders which is quite unusual cos they're quite shy
B	yeah
A	I sort of switch it from one to the other you go and sit down I'll bring it in
B	I'm just hoping our roses survive the winter cos they've got this I don't know what it I don't know what it's called in English any more but it's erm it's a fungal disease and I knew as I told you you have to spray
A	yeah yeah
B	but they said and you must rake up all the leaves
A	yeah
B	because they because it's a fungus that will survive frost
A	right
B	erm so I did and of course we mulch them
A	yep
B	so erm I couldn't separate the mulch stuff and the leaves and I had to rake everything up
A	mm
B	and whether I got it all I don't know but I just hope so because you know they're new and they're just getting established and I don't want to start again can you if they did die
A	yeah
B	I'm wondering whether I then couldn't put roses there and that would be really a mess because we we've as the garden is so organised
A	yes
B	that this is this is the rose bed with the lavender round the edge
A	yeah yeah
B	and you know it'd be really
A	oh what I mean the question would be whether the whether the the mildew had erm
B	ah ha
A	erm so I'm sorry that's not very
B	yep and the then they say if you haven't got rid of it you can you can they spray them again but you must have a different spray
A	right
B	so I mean I had
A	sorry you said
B	I wouldn't I wouldn't despair immediately but
A	you said yes to milk yeah?
B	yes please
A	cos right okay sorry you just said with a little bit too much coffee in there
B	yeah
A	erm
B	what's the matter?
A	is that enough milk? sorry I've got it very full
B	no I'd rather have a bit more please
B	shall I come and slurp it?
A	I was gonna say if I put more milk in there you're not going to be able to carry it are you? do you want to do it yourself and then
B	you're not going to be able to go for a walk
A	I don't I really don't think I am no I'm sorry but if I'd had the experience of going for a walk actually makes it better then I would say yes but actually going for a walk seems to make it worse so
B	mm
A	I would just have thought it would loosen it up and and help but it wouldn't seem to
B	well we'll chat and then I'll ring I'll ring
A	yeah
B	and say hello did you have a good day yesterday? and then I'll tootle off
A	well if you want to ring her on my landline
B	okay
A	erm I've got a a package so it doesn't make any difference
B	oh right
A	right
B	for her
A	mm just unfortunately
B	yeah
A	so does she realise or did you manage not to let her realise that that she's forgotten something?
B	no I I I said you know I didn't say is everything okay for Friday? I just said because I was going to be there I'd like to come and see you on Friday
A	ah right
B	and she said oh no it's not possible
A	yeah
B	cos otherwise she would have felt
A	yes yes
B	erm mortified
A	yeah
B	to see her they look after her a lot I mean
A	right
B	they take her out they'll take her to the seaside and they'll just sit her in a deck chair and she enjoys being by the seaside and
A	oh right
B	and they erm I mean when dad died they brought her up to the funeral and erm you know they look after her it's not they're not there sort of every day or anything
A	no but still yeah that's
B	but they do they do look after her and I mean
A	mm
B	and I was there in I went to see her in April last
A	yeah
B	but I mean she doesn't see us very often
A	no
B	erm and but I mean we are at we are her only living relatives
A	right
B	and so
A	mm
B	and she's she really does enjoy having visits I mean she talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about
A	yes yeah
B	is exactly the same as what she's been doing when you saw her the
A	mm yeah
B	she never complains about anything and she's just a happy person
A	right
B	you know she she never moans about things at all and she's a joy to be with
A	well that probably makes a difference to er the people who
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	the the erm that's much more rewarding isn't it?
B	yeah
A	well I go er from time to time since I moved from the other house I've been back to see
B	okay
A	erm and it was
A	and she had a very loud voice and I was always conscious that the whole neighbourhood could hear the conversation
A	but very kind and
B	right
A	yeah
A	and then my mum came round the
B	yeah
A	that's the sort of neighbour you need really
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm so I made a point of of going back
A	so she's a widow now he died
B	mm
A	they'd sort of been childhood sweethearts always lived in the area only moved about three streets but they haven't got kids so although she's got a nephew a nephew and a niece I think possibly more than you know she's certainly got a sister who's in the area erm it's not the same thing as actually having your own children who might call and so on
B	mm
A	and and she talks and talks and talks
B	yep yeah
A	and she's lonely
B	yep
A	and it's so sad when she is when she is such a gregarious person
B	mm I mean
A	mm
B	but she and
A	mm
B	he he was a boilermaker and I mean didn't earn that much money but they were very thrifty
A	mm
B	and then they'd say and now we're going on the QE two
A	mm
B	you know and erm they they had a I don't know it was a Concorde flight from
A	mm
B	but the could say they've been on the QE two
A	yeah yeah
B	and she says she's so happy that she did that because now she can remember it cos
A	mm
B	and he died before it got dreadful and he couldn't speak and swallow and
A	see this is
B	you know so it was a mercy and and I think she she realised that the only thing that
A	we'll it's a long way to come isn't it? yeah
B	but
A	mm
B	and there was
A	yeah
B	rather than
A	mm
B	erm so
A	oh that's not nice is it
B	and so she when he died she was just far too nervous to live on her own there
A	mm
B	and that's why she went into to to erm sheltered accommodation not really because she was forced to
A	mm
B	erm and it it wasn't a huge she wouldn't have really been rattling around in the
A	mm but yeah
B	but er she just felt she couldn't
A	oh I can understand yes I think that would be very
A	yeah no my the the my colleague
B	mm
A	and that was I think it's cancer of the oesophagus or something I mean it was that sort of thing cos the first we knew about it was he rang her at work and at that point she and I shared a phone
B	right
A	she wasn't in the office so I picked up erm and I almost thought it was a joke because his voice was so sort of hoarse and funny erm and
B	mm mm
A	erm lying on the bed and he was nursed at home
B	I mean she didn't let did she
A	well she was there but no they had somebody they had somebody coming in erm
B	yeah yeah
A	sort of I don't think permanently but maybe twice a day or something like that
B	mm
A	and she was looking after him in between
B	mm mm
A	erm but I don't know how old how old he was I probably did ask her at the time she's a couple of years older than me so at that point she might have been
B	mm
A	but she was either fifty or fifty-one now
B	mm
A	erm he was Austrian and I think they'd met when she was working in the Czech Republic
B	mm
A	erm and and seemed to have well as you and
B	mm yeah yeah
A	erm
B	mm that's hard yeah
A	and we were all saying we don't know what to do
B	yeah
A	erm it's quite unusual I mean if it was a man you might get that feeling although a lot of men are much more touchy-feely than they than they like to let on aren't they but I mean my brother's a right total softy and always has been
B	yeah
A	but er
B	did did you know
A	mm yeah
B	cos she's very very private she's had a bad summer cos she's been suffering from depression
A	mm
B	and she's not
A	mm
B	erm you know I had
A	yes
A	yep I didn't really know
B	no I I didn't I didn't know
A	I knew of him obviously but I'm not sure I ever actually met him
B	no well anyway there was
A	mm
B	who came round to supper last week
A	oh
B	and I said to
A	yeah
B	old times at the
A	oh dear
B	but I thought for them she would sort of make the effort
A	yeah
B	because they know her and love her and have known her for a long time and erm and she said afterwards she said I'm very sorry you know and I'm a misery and I don't come out and I said well you cope with you know for you home sweet home is home
A	yeah
B	and you you feel the need to be at home and safe in your home and that's fine I don't feel I don't feel upset or offended that you're not coming to supper
A	mm
B	it's just I thought you would enjoy it
A	yeah
B	and you she you I know that you can't just say well you know snap out of it because it's not you know
A	it's not like that
B	she's ill
A	yeah
B	she's ill and
A	but I would have thought that being with a small group of people that she knew well would actually have been okay so that's not good really is it?
B	yeah she so she won't erm
A	mm
B	she sort of crawls into
A	mm
B	and she's quite happy mooching about and she plays bridge online and that's her big thing is plays bridge online
A	right
B	but I just thought as you say for people a very small
A	yeah
