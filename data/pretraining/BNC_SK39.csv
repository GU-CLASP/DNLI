A	okay so it's on now
B	mm hm

B	I went to Tokyo I met up with em an ex colleague of mine
A	who is that?
B	no
A	didn't go with
B	no
A	oh
B	no
A	how did you go around then?
B	I went by myself no but I met up with a colleague
A	who's from where?
B	she's from South Africa
A	oh
B	well I went around with her you see and em I was staying there for about two nights
A	oh she lived there?
B	yeah she lived there
A	oh she was in banking?
B	she was in she was working there and she was living in this host family house
A	oh I see
B	and I lived with and like I stayed with her and then she we went round together
A	oh
B	and she
A	so she was in a language course or was she working there?
B	no she was an accountant
A	so she was working in Japan?
B	mm
A	and staying with a host family?
B	mm
A	sounds funny
B	I don't know how she
A	mm
B	and it was all cheese based
A	really?
B	cheese cake and slices of cheese
A	oh no
B	and I told her
A	Cos she thought that was what you would be able to eat
B	yeah and I told her I couldn't eat any of it
A	oh no
B	so she had to quickly make me something
A	oh
B	and then em and then we went round Japan together or to the fish market this very famous fish market
A	just Tokyo or any other city?
B	it was just Tokyo
A	wow
B	yeah eh I stayed one night in Kyoto in this this em this hotel which only cost about thirty pounds it was really nice
A	mm
B	really basic but it's got
A	mm
B	it was really nice just really plain
A	mm
B	and that was brilliant but it we had a very short time in each temple
A	mm and you had to go with the group?
B	yeah we were
A	okay
B	but no but if you're on your own it's quite good
A	yeah
B	it covers a lot of distance and
A	that's true
B	and a lot of ground
A	you don't feel so lonely
B	you don't feel so lonely
A	mm
B	but they didn't have breakfast and the room wasn't very nice it stank of smoke
A	mm
B	cigarettes
A	oh two thousand and seven
B	so I spent a week in Hong Kong
A	just before I met you
B	in fact yeah a few months actually
A	mm
B	and
A	so you didn't have any problems with the language travelling around?
B	no because a lot of them spoke English anyway
A	oh in the tourist industry
B	yeah
A	oh
B	baby your head is like
A	kit's head is alright
B	I didn't move him did I?
A	oh no
B	and then em
A	that was your only trip to Japan?
B	it was my only trip to Japan and then em yeah and then when I
A	his head is face down
B	and then when
A	oh
B	I em went to this restaurant where you pay in this vending machine outside
A	that's weird?
B	like you know and then you get a ticket and then you go inside the restaurant
A	mm
B	and then you get your meal
A	mm
B	it was brilliant
A	that's clever
B	and the place where I met her was Shibuya
A	shibuya?
B	something like that
A	I've heard of Shibuya
B	I don't know
A	or in Tokyo
B	well you know they all look the same with all those em criss cross
A	crossings
B	zebra Crossings
A	okay
B	no I didn't feel it was very big
A	right
B	like the girls had all had long hair
A	mm
B	dyed copper with em Burberry rain coats
A	really? So it's
B	style raincoats
A	so it's fashion but everyone follows the same fashion?
B	yeah and
A	yeah
B	like a lot of them
A	mm
B	they're more narrow than we are
A	like an androgynous nineteen seventies look?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they were all in black suits
A	mm
B	thin ties
A	bit like the seventies in the UK
B	em
A	yeah cos some countries like Italy I noticed with the students we had
B	yeah
A	even if it's they're not in school uniform but they're all dressed in the same fashion
B	well if you look at a teenager now they all look the same
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	do they?
B	mm hm
A	I think teenagers in outside London tend to dress the same as well
B	oh everywhere
A	in London London though you tend to get more differentiation
B	and girls all dress the same
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh look that's the Asimo robot isn't it? That's come a long way
B	oh
A	they used to sell them here as gimmicky toys didn't they? But now they're these are quite big ones on this television program there
B	mm
A	that's really clever look at it
A	so em  excuse me
B	and I went to Hong Kong with
A	oh right
B	and we went through to Taiwan together
A	oh I see
B	Cos her sister at the time was living there with her husband
A	mm
B	he was working there
A	and where did you think of Taiwan?
B	em they have really nice foods and lots of really nice street food
A	eh mm hm
B	em evening at the evening eh there was this street market that was open in the evening and it was just amazing
A	oh yeah that's how they market themselves now on the adverts
B	yeah
A	but how was it different to Hong Kong? Did you get an impression? The people or the pace of life or was it the same was it similar?
B	em well Taiwan was bigger than Hong Kong
A	yeah
B	A lot more spacious
A	Taipei
B	em but
A	I suppose there have more of Japanese influence
B	oh yeah I did
A	mm
B	and I came out the next day and I flew Air China
A	so you didn't stay very long in Taiwan?
A	you
B	no I didn't
A	yeah
B	or maybe it was two nights but
A	only two nights? That's a bit strange
B	but that was I don't know why we did that actually because I don't know
A	and that's in two thousand and seven?
B	two thousand and three
A	oh you hadn't been since two thousand and three?
B	yeah
A	no
B	and two thousand and seven
A	and you hadn't been
B	for many years
A	oh
B	many many years
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think we went back twice
A	as a family I mean?
B	we never went back as a family
A	you never?
B	no
A	huh
B	we only went back separately
A	oh right
B	went with my mum and dad but I've never been there with my brothers
A	oh wow
B	oh
A	and em
B	mm
A	what was I gonna say? So did how many brothers and sisters does
B	she's only got one older sister
A	oh alright
B	and em they had this dog this sausage dog
A	mm
B	it was quite the body was quite a normal size but the legs were really short and it sat on my foot and it was really heavy
B	I mean you felt
A	oh no
B	because for some reason the camera this is  this is  the early days of
A	mm
B	so I only had film camera
A	two thousand and three?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Boots camera
A	A camera I bought in Boots I think
B	wow
A	it was really really dodgy
B	mm but I mean I had a really good Fuji camera
A	not just a
B	A film camera
A	oh
B	and maybe cos it was em it
A	it would have been not digital?
B	no it wasn't digital
A	mm
B	that was when the those em I don't know what what film they call it now
A	disposable
B	no no no
A	oh
B	but they never  they never  became very big because it's really difficult to frame
A	oh
B	em
A	oh no I had a Minolta
B	mm hm
A	in China
B	eh yeah but luckily
A	oh that's good
B	yeah
A	so you haven't been anywhere else in Japan apart from Tokyo and Kyoto?
B	and Kyoto yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I see
B	yeah and I was just travelling around Hong Kong by myself in two thousand and three
A	alright
B	quite a bit actually
A	that with your cousins? No?
B	my cousins?
A	who live there
B	they were too young
A	oh I see
B	they were only about ten years old
A	oh yes sorry yeah
B	no
A	shiyan or Guangzhou no?
B	no
A	mm hm yeah let's rather visit but I think better are inland places like Shiyan and Changdao and places like that
B	yeah they did
A	they brought a lot of wealth and em
B	mm hm
A	business acumen
B	his face is all great
A	he likes sleeping on his stomach though doesn't he?
B	he does
A	what does it say in the book? Is it bad for the baby to sleep on their stomach on you? I mean is it em is it?
B	no
A	is it not
B	I think
A	it's only if they're left there?
B	I think it's for long term
A	mm
B	I mean
A	it's more comfortable for him
B	thirty forty years ago
A	after feeding isn't it?
B	it was  It was It was  eh recommended that you put them on their front
A	is that what
B	that's what
A	oh I
B	yeah
A	as a baby we don't how they're feeling but eh yeah
B	but no I think
A	so
B	they they feel okay sleeping on their
A	so the NCT people have been in touch? The about meeting up again no?
B	no
A	really?
B	yeah
A	you think they got that from the weekend meeting?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	well yeah because they haven't emailed about Wednesday
A	oh they wanted to meet up this Wednesday?
B	yeah
A	Cos they might just
B	mm hm
A	because some of them are on their own aren't they? They haven't got any family
B	yeah
A	so for them it's more important
B	Cos I didn't think Vanessa was that friendly
A	to you?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	which is fine you know I don't have to have you know
A	no
B	I wish we hadn't
A	really?
B	we'd have saved ourselves three hundred pounds
A	oh
B	well I wanted the information
A	well you didn't know at the time you didn't? Well do you think it was useful to get both of them? The NHS and the NCT classes?
B	I felt  I felt  a lot better with the information
A	mm
B	I didn't
A	no
B	I went there for the information
A	well yes I think other people in the group went there to make friends didn't they?
B	mm hm
A	em
B	because you know as much as you read books you still get a different set of information when you attend a class
A	yeah
B	you know with the teacher and all?
A	well that's right
B	mm
A	and if you don't sort of join in the banter without beer drinking and all that
B	oh you know
A	they're okay
B	mm no I don't think
A	that's it
B	and also don't they have the other friends that they need to you know entertain?
A	oh that's right
B	I mean I don't I can't be bothered
A	that's fine though
B	I don't know I don't feel like I should pressure myself into thinking
A	yeah
B	I need to be friends with them
A	that's like when
B	I mean cos
A	yes
B	she can't work
A	right
B	and she's only moved here for two years so she's usually you know wanting to make friends and meet people and
A	well yeah cos it was interesting that she came there to these glasses after having a child already you'd think they were for people who haven't had children yet
B	mm hm
A	but she's had a child and she didn't have them for her it's definitely where they're meeting people isn't it?
B	and also she knew she was gonna have a caesarean
A	yeah
B	em
A	well yes a double reason really for not going to NCT classes isn't it?
B	mm hm
A	because but so yeah she was obviously there which is fine
B	no that's right
A	yeah but em
B	mm
A	these super super fashionable glasses
B	no they're real glasses
A	really?
B	to correct their sight
A	but how do they know if the child's sight needs correcting at that young age?
B	I don't know
A	it's ridiculous
B	maybe they went to opticians and
A	no but
B	I don't know
A	I only needed glasses when I was fourteen
B	I know
A	but that's so stupid
B	about fourteen as well
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and you can you know you can articulate that you need glasses
B	mm hm
A	but em if you're a toddler you can't say I need glasses can you?
B	mm
A	I don't know I think he's he's out for the count at the moment isn't he? So em let's see if it gets to nine and he wakes up em I'll bath him if not we can go straight to bed but when did we last bath him?
B	not yesterday maybe the day before?
A	it was the day before yesterday? Okay
B	mm
A	but you know I mean they're not London streets are not designed for them are they? They just get in the way
B	no
A	why don't Japanese companies sell these sort of cars here?
B	I think they are going to aren't they? Cos em
A	because they would be perfect for London streets which are cramped and you know you get into
B	now what was I going to say? Oh god I've forgotten now
A	what em have you heard from
A	oh
A	okay
B	gone back for like maybe a couple of weeks or more now
A	oh
B	and I did call her two weeks after and eh she said she's trying not to think about it
A	oh for jobs?
B	for jobs and em
A	so she's doing the rent in a by herself?
B	she's at the moment she says it makes sense to you know
A	they didn't have a mortgage?
B	no
A	oh dear
B	this is all about really
A	on on the phone
B	well he seems really happy and he keeps asking her when she's going to join him
A	what?
B	which is not going to happen because
A	well I thought he I thought they were separating?
B	well I don't know what illusions he's em he's holding to
A	really
B	Cos for her there's nothing for her so
A	no
B	well no we'll I think she won't be able to have her
A	so they haven't really split split up or he thought
B	well it's all
A	it's more about him being home sick
B	well and her not? And also I think he he wasn't committing himself and financially it was a strain on her
A	right I see
B	oh I don't know about
A	mm
B	again
B	not every week
A	oh she's sent you photos?
B	I saw photos on her phone
A	oh wow
B	Wapping
A	oh yeah there are some nice big flats down there
B	and I think she's got one of them
A	wow
B	well I can't because she hasn't settled yet
A	eventually
B	eventually yeah
A	or something
B	no eventually I want to take get out by myself
A	yeah I know you will
B	tV series
A	tV series
B	I'm re-watching this one it's called Heart of Grace
B	yeah
A	I see
B	well no
A	right
B	em internet place
A	so what what what are the main storylines generally? What do they tend to be about?
B	they tend to be just about families and you know in in all of that they'll be
A	mm
B	and within the families they'll be like arguments or arguing about money arguing about eh inheritance say but
A	A lot of them seem to deal with these em like small companies or something
B	yeah or
A	it seems to be a continuous theme from my casual observation of it like a small business
B	yeah like say eh you know  you know  someone just got the job and they've got this really difficult task to do
A	yeah
B	and it's like an impossible task then always someone comes along to help them which in reality won't happen of course
A	mm
B	but it's not
A	like a fairy godmother type?
B	yeah it's always like a fairy godmother type but you know no no one takes these series as real obviously no one thinks that they're realistic
A	no
B	or believe in or you know like
A	so as a
B	no
A	is it less or more serious?
B	it's even less serious
A	it's even less serious than Neighbours?
B	yeah
A	right
B	it's it's just fantasy really
A	right
B	which even though it plays out like
A	mm
B	or or normal everyday life
A	more cartoonish?
B	it is actually
A	do you think psychologically it appeals to what Hong Kong people want their situations to be? Or is it total escapism?
B	I think it's just total escapism
A	okay
B	Hong Kong people are too realistic for that
A	are they?
B	yeah
A	so what who is the target audience? Is it very much housewives?
B	I think it's em
A	is it female and housewives?
B	and young children like
A	young children?
B	ten
A	really? So young children to and their mothers to watch it at the same time?
B	yeah
A	it's targeted at that audience?
B	because when I came to the UK and I was seven and a half and
A	you watched them with your mum?
B	the week
A	oh sorry
B	Don't try to guess
B	em no the week we flew we came to England there was this really big series cos it was coming out it was really advertised and everything
A	mm
B	and I was like oh my god we're gonna miss it but we didn't because where we live someone delivered stuff to us and delivered tapes
A	oh
B	which is part of the
A	distribution centre
B	yeah
A	right
B	and then we would watch all the series and it was only seven and eight
A	right
B	it's because it's the teenagers who becomes fans of these uprising stars you know
A	you can do a PHD on
B	Good
A	and why people watch them
B	well I'm off to
A	that's if you've done sociology
B	well it's quite interesting because a few years ago I met this girl who was gonna have a year's experience at at the TVB at the moment at the time which was only one studio
A	mm
B	non non paying they'd just be working I was really happy to go there
A	voluntary
B	voluntary
A	mm
B	on like
A	on soap operas
B	on soap operas and they did have a years ago they did have another eh rival but they didn't  they didn't
A	but they can't be the only channel who makes soap operas in Hong Kong? Are they?
B	ah I think they might be
A	mm
B	and they were buying these big stars from TVB
A	I see
B	and this this the series was not not very good or
A	mm
B	it wasn't very popular and then they started promoting these stars uprising stars that weren't even good looking and
A	right
B	eh I think they went bankrupt anyway
A	right you mean private ones? So it's been deregulated?
B	I think so  I think so  and then now they are then in talks with these real established stars to come over
A	mm
B	and they're not allowed to make any films
A	with the other studios
B	apart from when the management allowed them to be loaned to the different studios
A	right
B	so now
A	is he waking up? No
B	I think it's a bit like that where in Hong Kong the management signs you up for you know four five years and you're not allowed to work with you know
A	oh I see it's the same as if you signed with ITV or BBC or whatever
B	yeah
A	okay
B	and now a lot of stars are are are are are em want in in Hong Kong wants to be eh on pay per series?
A	right
B	more freedom
A	right
B	Cos obviously now
A	yeah
B	a lot of them have gone to em have gone to China
A	right really?
B	yes they have cos they all get paid a lot more
A	but you mean making Cantonese language ones is Guangzhou or they learn Mandarin?
B	we'll I'm not sure cos
A	and they redub them
B	and they dub them
A	right
B	yeah
A	I think I saw a few when I was teaching English there
B	because I have seen one or two only clips of mainline mainland
A	right
B	and the Cantonese were speaking Cantonese and then the mainland stars have been dubbed
A	have been dubbed yes it's the other way
B	so you know one series could be sale sold
A	yeah
