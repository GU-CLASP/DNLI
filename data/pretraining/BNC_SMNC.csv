A	these are fashionable yeah
B	oh yeah but wellies went through a bit of a
A	oh did they?
B	yeah they cos you can get them all different patterns now they went through a bit of a transformation they used to be just the green ones didn't they?
A	yeah
B	the green or black or white if you worked in Bernard Matthews
B	yeah the white wellie brigade used to go on the buses on the bus
B	go and work at Bernard Matthews
A	what was that so you can see the blood?
B	I guess yeah yeah
A	what Bernard Matthews?
B	or something like that or they closed down too many workers
B	look at her
A	she's fast asleep
B	yeah
A	well it looks like that lightning's moved over now
B	shh shh shoo shoo shoo shoo shoo it's okay
B	maybe I
A	yeah
B	I'm a bit worried I just
A	some what?

A	it's only olive oil isn't it?
B	no it's lavender and tea tree
A	oh
B	it's diluted
A	oh be alright do her some good toughen her up

A	that washing's out there is it gonna get wet? where is it
B	yeah if it's outside it's gonna get wet
A	no it's covered
B	grab it
A	no I mean that's a good thing it might actually dry because of the humidity it doesn't dry anyway
B	mm
A	while this storm's spinning around above us then
B	what plan?
A	I thought you had a plan
B	today?
A	for our future
B	no I said I was gonna spend some time thinking about it
A	oh
B	about what to do
A	mm
B	this year my main goal is to improve my
A	how are you gonna do that?
B	by attempting to get things done as soon as I get them like you get that email through saying do your visa and you just go and do your visa straight away no dilly-dallying about no leaving it and then forgetting about the email and writing yourself and note and
A	mm
B	get it done
A	mm
B	now if I was doing
A	mm
B	and then I because I thought anything that we do in the future if we've got a chance of working from home it would be good but neither of us have the self-discipline to work from it
A	no
B	so I need that skill
A	I when we when we were in Oman
B	not work from home but
A	no but
B	you had the discipline
A	cos I had to
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it doesn't make your life easier we have to
A	yeah
B	do paperwork we have to do it
B	and get it done
A	yeah
B	otherwise it's just in your mind and then
A	that sounds like quite an easy aim to be honest
B	no I don't think it is I've been trying to do it for twenty years like
A	all you need to do is just take action on
B	well can you do it then?
A	yeah
B	right will you do the tax forms tonight?
B	let's just get it all done
A	I've got other things to do tonight
A	well what about your Chinese are you still gonna study that?
B	yeah I've been studying every day
A	oh
B	look er look I've got it right next to me
A	oh
B	yeah
A	just do your HS course the test
B	no it doesn't matter about the test really but it's a good thing to
A	I think it's a good thing to do a test it's pretty cheap isn't it?
B	yeah
A	to take it you might as well get it and stick it on your CV that you've got elementary
B	yeah
A	Chinese language
B	yeah
A	it's not a bad thing to have
B	mm
A	and you're pretty much there already to get the elementary one
B	I need vocabulary
A	yeah but
B	mm
A	I think that's a good thing
B	mm
A	I mean once you've got that
B	I can't believe
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well she just goes blabbing to everyone doesn't she?
B	yeah
A	that's the best way to learn a language
B	yeah
A	plus she speaks five languages anyway and she's got a knack for it
B	she knows to yeah she has got a knack she just knows
A	mm
B	knows what what has to be done
A	yeah
B	I've never been very good have I?
A	well the main thing
B	it's
A	is just using it
B	that's why
A	and not being shy about making mistakes
B	yeah that's I've been
A	mm
B	she could be a teacher of Chinese because she just
A	mm
B	and I'm saying it completely wrong most of the time
A	mm
B	just from
A	no but it's gonna be helpful though
B	and she knows my mistakes
A	socks is
B	no
A	no?
B	that's a hat
A	oh
B	it's a bit that's a hat
A	a hat socks is

A	I think that's funny if she'll speak like a farmer
B	you'll speak like Chinese farmer
A	I'd rather her speak like a farmer than a
B	they're they're really funny they they're quite snobby about accents

B	yeah
A	communist party central

A	they won't well they can't just
B	and er is that the only walk in
A	no of course it's not
A	well where are they? they don't exist

A	does she speak Chinese?
B	yeah yeah so yeah I
A	well I know they they have been all over
B	all over
A	have you seen the map they've got?
B	no
A	behind their desk they've got they've got pins in all the places they've been
B	oh
A	and they've been to a lot
B	yeah
A	but I don't know what
B	they
A	they did it depends what you do do you go and stay in the city or
B	in the summer they
A	are they going out for adventures and so
B	well they climbed the
A	let's go and have a lie down shall we?
B	erm they were told that it was too dangerous to stay
A	why?
B	because you might fall off you couldn't see anything any steppings or anything
A	oh
B	shh oh
A	yeah but
B	oh
A	yeah that sounds like a very Chinese things to say
B	she's not Chinese
A	no but if they were told that
A	everything
A	it's all concreted
A	where you can go what you're allowed to do
B	she's awake now
A	when to take a picture
B	yeah
A	you know all that kind of stuff
B	oh
B	mm yeah
A	just see maybe I should go in I'll give you a second
A	er yeah
B	like
A	do you think they'll deliver a takeaway in this weather?
B	oh I don't yeah
A	it's a little bit unfair isn't it?
B	mm
A	erm I think it'll pass though in about half an hour
B	yeah it might do
A	it seems to be thinning out a bit
B	oh I feel bad shall we run her a bath?
A	well like you said she needs to go to bed in half an hour
B	what time is it now?
A	yeah they died
B	yeah
A	just before we got there
B	yeah I know it's really
A	if we hadn't got lost that could have been us on that bridge at the time
B	shh oh
A	there was a Chinese guy who died as well just jumping in to save him
B	I know that's really sad isn't it? oh shh
A	no it was his mate wasn't it?
B	I can't
A	on bamboo bridge
B	yeah somebody jumped to save him
A	people are always dying jumping in to save people don't they?
B	oh god but you can't just stay there
B	what can you do?
A	it's I don't I think it's one of those things that you just don't know what you're going to do
B	until the time
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then what are you gonna bring to the situation? are you gonna jump in
B	if
A	and put yourself in the same situation?
B	you have to quickly assess it don't you?
A	well what are you gonna do?
B	mm
A	mm
B	well you have to quickly assess whether you think that you can do something or not
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I don't think
B	I mean
A	anyone could survive that so
B	the the guy
A	so it's basically suicide if you jump in at
B	he must have thought he was strong enough
A	yeah
B	striking
B	I didn't
B	oh he's mean to me
A	no
B	we should go
A	no cos last time we left China

B	too far really
A	well I don't wanna go to that the wall closest to
B	what are you doing with your hair?
A	why?
B	I don't know you're
A	I would prefer to go further afield and see
B	yeah I know yeah
A	older parts of the wall than
B	but that would take some research
A	so pretty
B	you can't just say right we'll go up to you know you need to work out what you're doing and which buses to get on and everything
A	but you know what it's gonna be like it's gonna be

A	oh well I don't know
B	okay stay here over Christmas right yeah yeah yeah three weeks in the er Spring Festival yeah? all three weeks or two and a half weeks?
A	well maybe two weeks then and three weeks in summer which leaves us five days
B	to mess about
A	ooh
A	that was a good one
B	I I can't really hold her with this hand cos I've got all that oil over me
A	erm no how many days have you got? have you got thirty-five
B	erm I mean I we need to write it all down and do it all properly rather than just
A	well didn't we
B	and then just put in an application right now
A	yeah but we've got an extra five days this year though
B	yeah how many do we have?
A	so normally you have so we've got thirty-five days
B	yeah
A	not including weekends
B	yeah ah ah she's kissing my neck again

A	okay so
B	that spot on your face
A	yeah if we take three weeks in Chinese New Year
B	yeah
A	three weeks in summer
B	okay
A	that still leaves us five days so
B	yeah
A	so we can take the two days
B	now
A	in the couple of weeks when it is
B	and then maybe the
A	to make the week
B	yeah maybe we'll have two days at Christmas or something
A	and then we've got three days
B	or two days somewhere else yes
A	three days left over or carry them on for next year or whatever
B	okay let's do it
A	well I dunno
B	three weeks' holiday in February
A	well cos we're gonna go back to
B	yeah but you've gotta think where are we gonna be for
A	and I don't wanna spend three weeks in

B	ah ah
A	does work only pay for a direct flight?
B	er?

B	erm but
A	so you can stop in
B	or
A	or
B	yeah
A	no
B	you were gonna have a look at how cold it is in
A	yeah I imagine it would be pretty cold but
B	colder than the north of
A	probably not
A	or
A	do you fancy
B	I'd like to stop in
A	there's a week
B	cos we we were just too poor there where we went
A	yeah
B	like I think you need to some some cities you just need money some cities you need to be poor in because you experience it better some cities you need to have some money
A	yeah well we didn't eat anything
B	we stayed in that shitty little room with just a bed
A	yeah
B	walls all the way round the bed
B	it was horrible
A	yeah
B	er?
A	no we were
B	no
A	yeah
B	but that was that was ridiculous and that
A	and we were living off about twenty dollars a day
A	in
B	I don't think you could do now I don't what we used to do I don't think you could do anymore
A	no
B	I don't think you can be such a poor traveller anymore
A	yeah
B	tips
A	but that that's quite a long time isn't it three weeks?
B	yeah I think it's quite a long it is quite a long holiday whether
A	cos I'd need
B	you'd want another week somewhere instead
A	I don't know if I do want three weeks
B	three whole weeks holiday is quite a lot unless you've got a definite plan I mean your brother's wedding that's that's basically the
A	the last week?
