B	I don't even know my own accent
A	eh London
C	birthplace Doncaster
B	it's not though
A	yeah but it's like it London means most of the South cos I would say I've got a London accent but I grew up in Sussex
B	okay
A	but I was born in London
C	yeah you don't have an accent like cockney but it's definitely a southern accent
A	it's a southern accent
C	yeah
A	and actually cos I was recording our conversation on Sunday and I loaded it on to my Mac at work and listened to it and oh my god I sound common
C	my my voice

A	D O Y
A	ah that's nice
A	because
C	me I'm so angry so angry right
A	yeah
C	so I went it I said look I don't really know what the hell happened with that like I know I get interest every month because it's an overdraft
A	mm hm
C	it usually works out between five and ten quid depending on how much into the overdraft is for the majority of the month
A	mm
C	it's like one percent or something it's really good
A	mm
C	I've had it since I was eighteen
A	oh yeah
C	and bounced it over then I got a like a a change to say we had to say no and a charge to say you're over your overdraft limit
A	mm
B	charge for cheque yeah that was fucked
A	mm
B	and I realised since December two thousand and ten I have an amount of either seven pounds something of eight pounds something coming out of my account every month
A	mm
B	Don't ask me how I haven't noticed this
A	right
B	for two years
A	Good job you're keeping an eye on your accounts
B	yeah
A	mm

B	yeah
C	but it's not
A	no
C	or home insurance contents insurance
A	mm
C	well you really should it's it's free for the first three months
A	mm
C	worst case scenario
A	Jesus Christ
C	I kid you not
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	you know really I should be claiming more compensation for the fact that you've taken me over my overdraft limit a million times for something that I've never agreed for
B	mm
A	absolutely
C	by the way that's illegal
A	yeah yeah
C	I said do you know what I just I don't really I just want you to sort it out give the reimbursement for the hundred and however much it is
A	mm

C	eh it wouldn't have got in that quick would it?
A	it might just it might just be confirmation

C	yeah well the thing is for my Navy application I need to when I go there I have to take my medical card
B	I didn't
C	I didn't know what the hell they were
A	well I've seen them but I have no idea where mine is

B	mm
A	then you've gotta get a babysitter I suppose
B	yeah
A	you could take food to hers and cook a nice dinner there
B	yeah it'd be Yeah it'd be better doing that cos the kids the kids go to bed at six
A	yeah
B	and you don't hear from them
A	oh
B	it's great you don't hear a wink out of the kids
A	well that's good

B	yeah
A	yeah
C	wellingtons and then like wizard macs

C	I remember those
A	no I don't know what Doogles are
C	really they were
A	like a T bar?
C	yes
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	and it was like a metal clip to fasten it
A	yeah I don't remember
C	doogles
A	Cos they were obviously really easy to do up as a kid aren't they you haven't got laces or anything to worry about
C	and I remember when I went to high school

C	everybody wore Kickers or Pods
A	mm

A	yeah you know they did some rainbow eh stilettos
C	oh yeah I remember that Jesus
A	yeah

C	they were
B	it's alright I left my cup there
C	do you want me to move that bag?
B	no it's alright
C	em
B	it's the last of
C	after we'd started wearing
A	mm
C	and I bought some flat pods and they looked like black trainers
A	ah nice
C	yeah they were great
A	love it
B	all us kids used to rebel on trainers at school and we used like black Reebok Classics
C	yeah
B	like pure black and even if there was a little bit of colour on them we'd just colour them in
C	mm
B	it was great great
C	that was awful like we
B	it wasn't very comfy
C	even in sixth form we had to wear a uniform
A	nice
C	maroon blazer
A	yum
C	so that's nice
A	I used to have to wear that when I was doing security
C	and then in the sixth form we wore black
A	okay well at least you looked different then
C	with the same tie which was a bit shit but
A	mm
C	black blazer black trousers
A	oh okay
C	so I thought I was cool
A	nice
C	em and a fitted shirt which were banned and a black kind of big knit cardy with holes in so you could see my shirt through it that kind of wrapped round and yeah I thought it was great
A	for sure
C	Don't know why I did that really but apparently I thought it was important at the time
C	and my new school handbag
A	oh I was that was the best thing though wasn't it? Like in August going shopping for your new shoes
C	did you? I used I had shoes from Shoe Shoe shoes
A	that's
B	I used to look forward to getting a new rucksack
A	new school bag
B	yeah
A	I used to ram my
B	yeah
A	like in the beginning of school I used ram it full of stuff
B	yeah
A	and like almost break it carrying everything I owned in it
C	I used to have those handbags from Kookai or from Morgan
A	yeah
B	all the girls used to do that they'd come in with loads of bags like that
A	there was a particular style wasn't there?
C	yeah
B	especially on a Friday going round for a sleepover and there'd be girls like coming in with like literally like they'd just been shopping on a Friday morning
A	sleepovers
B	yeah
A	oh I love a sleepover
B	yeah slumber party
C	we were actually horrendous
A	ah
C	pull out some clothes and shove them on
A	Jesus
C	and every bank holiday
A	you're animals
C	to work at the call centre was the time so
A	nice
C	you know at seventeen twenty pounds an hour was fucking awesome
A	yeah
C	em so we used to not go home get to the call centre and work a thirteen hour shift so be sat there at seven in the morning pissed as a fart trying to manage a team of ten
A	oh man alive
C	yeah
A	that's pretty bad
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and the the managers used to let us leave stuff in there like if we'd go straight from school to work and then straight from work out on bank holiday
A	mm
C	they'd let us leave our stuff in their cupboards and lock it for us
A	really?
C	yeah
A	oh god
C	the entire way probably four lengths of this house
A	ah
C	I see her out of the corner of my eye walk through we used to work for The National Rail walk through get to a seat plop herself down and I looked at her and she looked at me and as she looked forward and she kind of spun
A	aw
C	and she looked at her computer and just went dooosh and smacked her head on the desk and passed out
C	wheeled her to the nearest
A	that's
C	oh I'd forgotten that
A	that's that's actually genius isn't it really? Cos you can't lift a dead weight
B	no no
A	just wheel it
C	they dosed her up with coffee for an hour
A	at least she wouldn't feel it cos if she was that pissed she wouldn't have felt it
C	so not only did she get wheeled out of work smack her face on a desk smack her face on the bus some kid like three four year old got up and stamped on her fingers
A	stamped on her hands
C	we did all sorts We did all sorts
B	if you can get away with it yeah
C	they didn't sack anyone
A	even still though
C	so high
A	like I'm sure that's probably a sackable offence turning up pissed you know instant dismissal like no warnings
C	yeah
A	mm
C	A couple of days a week
A	oh god and they were all in the same place?
C	yeah it was huge
A	mm
C	and spend eight weeks training again
A	yeah
C	so
A	yeah
C	so in the end it was quite difficult to get sacked
A	mm
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	it all depends on what
A	well it has been done and it will it will I mean I couldn't do it now
B	oh
A	because I had to go to work and I had the hangover hat
B	yeah
A	and I was walking like that
B	it's you
A	and I was like yeah
B	it is
A	it absolutely cures all sins
B	it does
A	I felt first mouthful I was oh mm is this going to come back up again?
C	oh yeah
A	it's exactly what you need cos you need the sugar and you need the caffeine
B	Don't start off with the Coke you start off eating the Mars bar
A	I was eating the Mars bar
B	Cos the bubbles
A	because the food went in and I was like am I gonna be sick?
B	yeah
A	is it? Am I going to be sick? But it was fine
C	oh god
A	just over a year ago and I think actually and I couldn't do it again and I nearly died
C	yeah
A	you'd have to drive
C	I had not only do I have to drive but if I got there and I wasn't clued up it was so hard
A	mm
C	like cos I was organising the department but there's only two of us or four of us there and the rest of them were external
A	mm
C	and he the MD had no idea what I was doing so all the time I've got massive boards up trying to plan for like the rest of the year
B	who was doing it and time day month
C	mm mm mm mm mm
A	mm
C	it was B
A	mm
C	so if it's important but not urgent then just went to other boxes so
A	yeah
C	run of the mill stuff of doing cold calling and me checking her calls and doing my own work and it was so like
A	messy
C	all the time I couldn't go in hangover
A	no
C	when
A	no you don't
C	but I mean looking back that's why
A	mm
C	absolutely dead

C	which is fine
A	no way
C	yeah
A	mm
C	em but we need to look into the website cos we're not coming up on Google blah blah blah

C	minimum
A	she lost a contract?
C	no she sold a contract for our Christmas party next year but obviously our covers are really good this year which is why I got the bonus
A	mm
C	and basically we can sell the whole space for twelve grand
A	mm mm
C	she sold it half capacity and promised it them exclusively and I said to her no
A	mm mm
C	they could have one room exclusively and then we can only lose kinda twenty percent
A	yeah
C	but the bar spend on top of that last year was two grand so you're talking eight grand plus if they want bedrooms
A	yeah
C	Not that weekend I said give them this day or this day and then they can have it
A	mm
C	she didn't listen to me went to
A	yeah

B	well it does say a flashing rubber duck and rubber ducks need filling in for a bath

A	it's quite quiet isn't it?
C	mm

A	Don't do it
C	I don't think I'm gonna I was so shattered today at work
B	I don't think you're going to
A	you're gonna be you'd have to be there before six surely because you got to be at work at eight
C	nine
A	oh
C	well no it should be eight but because I stayed an hour late today
A	oh good so you finish at four

A	mm
C	but if you want to come in an hour later you can I was like fine
A	sweet
C	Cos she was like or we can get the GM to pay you for it and I was like for the extra five I'd rather have an hour in bed
A	yeah for sure
C	how rude
A	yeah
B	yeah what's up with your bike out there?
A	it's fucked
B	is it fucked?
A	did I tell you I fell off my bike have you seen my knees?
C	in short
B	no
C	you haven't seen oh
A	fuck
C	oh my god you missed a treat
A	they're looking They're looking alright now actually um
B	cor fucking hell
A	and eh that one's still sore when I wake up in the morning and I can't move it
B	eh hmm
A	and um I couldn't really walk so that was a bit of an issue
B	yeah
A	and I've done something I've eh hit my brake and so the brake is applied into the front tyre I got my dad to come round at the weekend and he can't figure it out
C	it literally in the bike?
A	yeah
C	inside the bike
A	inside the bike
B	I'll have a little look at it tomorrow
A	well don't worry cos especially if it snows
B	I did I did notice that the brake
A	the bike shop over the weekend
B	was disconnected
A	yeah because it's cos I can't wheel it
B	you know why you can't wheel it? Well you can wheel it
A	yeah I didn't realise that I could disconnect the brake
B	yeah
A	Cos I basically had to wheel it without it wheeling
B	okay
A	and I was like pissing blood and I was crying
B	fucking hell girl
A	and I looked like such a mess
B	see I knew none of this
A	no
B	I was fuming last week
A	what with me?
B	yeah
A	no I couldn't speak
A	when I came home When I came home on that Tuesday I changed into my joggers and went to my dad's crying
B	yeah
A	I couldn't speak
B	I was fuming last week weren't I?
C	eh you weren't angry when you said that to me
B	well I were I was I was annoyed and frustrated because I thought I was always saying to her you know what's up with
C	and I said nothing I don't know
B	some some something that I've not done
C	and and and he said have I done something? Cos she came in here and she didn't even say hello and I said
A	Cos I couldn't speak
B	I didn't know I didn't even know that
A	I had that
C	and I was like that's not like
A	it's this
B	yeah
A	if I think you have a problem with me you never talk to me about it
B	mm
A	you always talk to
B	mm
A	that frustrates me
C	you like to avoid conflict
B	do you know what? Go on
A	the thing is this this is never gonna to be a conflict
B	I know I
A	well I I find it really embarrassing talking about money
C	yeah I find it embarrassing
A	I think it's really rude
B	yeah
A	if someone had had to say it to me oh well do you want to get some beers from that time that you drank my
B	yeah
A	or whatever whatever the issue is I would rather much you talked to me
C	and I think when you're moving in somewhere like this it's like it's difficult isn't it to know
A	yeah
C	how how much you can say to another person
A	yeah when you don't know them that well
C	cos you go from that
A	you don't know how they're going to take it
C	it's really difficult to get gauge
A	like all day I was like should I say something should I not? And I was really nervous that's why I was like
B	what? About about the beer?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	when were you when was this? When were you nervous about the beer?
A	when I said to you do you want to get some beers in?
B	what via text message?
A	no no no no
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	I was like shall I say something? Should I not? You know it's fine but eh I
B	yeah I I think we knew that I understand that
A	that's why to me like it was really embarrassing having to say
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you drank all my beer so can you get some more in
B	yeah
A	money is just really it's really crude and I don't want to talk about it
B	no
C	I found cos I agree with you on this
B	yeah
C	I'm not talking multi-millionaire he's probably got accumulatively one or two
A	mm
C	not enough to write home about seeing as I'm trying to help him with his frigging divorce
B	mm
A	yeah
C	em but yeah we never ever never talk about money
A	that's what you learn
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you never ask you never talk about it it's just it's
B	yeah
A	so it's for me it was really like oh my god I was really nervous about it
C	yeah
A	A because I don't know you well enough so I don't know if you're gonna
B	it's only a few beers
A	but do you know
B	angry about it
C	but it doesn't last without you does it?
A	I don't know
B	oh no I know no
A	mm
B	we've all got to muck in together
C	and not everyone's
A	well yeah
B	I'm I'm I'm I'm not bothered about how helping housemates out if I can you know and I well I'm not saying that I expect the same back you know
C	yeah
B	it it happens so you know I'm not
A	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	Anna and Carmen it would be nice if we can include them as well
B	yeah
A	but for me like I just want you to know like if you've got something that's on your mind I'd much rather you talk to me about it
B	yeah
A	because it upsets me and it annoys me to think that you talked to somebody else
B	yeah
A	rather than come to me because then I think that's what breeds anger in the house
B	yeah
C	mm
A	it makes me feel uncomfortable to think you're secretly going and talking about me
C	mm
B	yeah
A	whereas actually you could be like I don't really understand why she did that?
C	you don't know how to judge the situation
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's probably just like really harmless
B	well yeah it's it's different cos you know
A	yeah of course yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah cos I said what I said to
B	yeah
C	but if you
B	yeah
C	and it wouldn't matter and I said is what will happen is over the more time it will just become normal
B	yeah
C	and that you won't feel a barrier at all
A	mm
C	it's just really strange like
A	I guess we spend less time less time together
C	that's it it's just a time thing
B	because you know it's it's
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
C	that's actually probably the time difference you know thinking about it
B	yeah you know it's quite a long time
C	yeah
B	you know it all adds up
A	mm
B	than what you are
C	yeah you you need your own space a bit more
A	mm
B	which is fine which is great you know
A	mm
B	you know I'm probably the same but
C	yeah I
B	just she yeah
A	yeah
B	Cos you know
C	she is a nosy chatterbox
C	as it happens
B	you know
A	I just love living in this house
C	sucking up to
B	no
A	no no me neither I mean the thing is
C	I do
B	oh
A	that I mean that's the defensiveness is a bit of a shame
C	but like that's the thing
A	I don't want her to feel persecuted
C	well yeah
A	mm
C	when I came in drunk singing with
B	yeah
C	I said I said
A	mm
C	and in the morning she brought it up and I said yeah oh no I'm really sorry
B	she stuck her head out did she?
C	yeah
B	oh I didn't know that
C	and had a go and I said I know I'm really sorry I'm going downstairs now I'm really sorry I'm going to bed
A	to plaster even though no one's got a plaster
C	pissed
B	there was plasters where? You've still got them haven't you?
C	yeah in the bathroom yeah
B	yeah it was a couple of days later weren't it?
C	yeah she brought it up again
A	and it has only been once or twice you know like really
C	yeah that's the first time I've ever woken
A	oh really? Okay
C	yeah and she came downstairs and she brought it up again and initially I was going to apologise and I went oh yeah I know
A	eh hmm
C	and I said well yeah but to be fair in the grand scheme of things I've woken you once and I get woken up every
B	mm
C	I think we're on quite a good winner there on your front
A	yeah
C	and that's what pissed me off cos when I brought it up with her when she brought it up with me even though it was just a one off occasion
A	yeah
C	the first thing I did automatically was apologise
B	we'll stick it in the oven now it's on the grill
C	and then we brought it up with her and she didn't
A	no
B	no
C	for the whole conversation she didn't say sorry once
A	and her fella quietly in the corner
C	ran away upstairs
A	yeah
C	this is what I said to
B	mm
A	and it's so hard because the last thing you want to be doing is saying to your housemates you can't have boyfriend over for in the night
C	aw
A	cos I'd been out
C	yeah
C	oh no
A	affects the house
B	yeah
A	which is what we said
B	well yeah sometimes you know like if I've got my window open
A	Cos they said oh it's it's cos you two have got the worst rooms as if it's somehow our fault because we have a room downstairs
B	yeah
A	I said well it wakes everybody up
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	Well
B	yeah
C	and then I said well you know he does make a lot of noise well I don't hear him
A	he wakes us up
C	yeah
A	and then she says
C	but that's not the conversation
A	and she says the reason she couldn't let him out the back door is because she goes back to sleep
C	yeah
A	so she's not got an issue
C	no
A	she goes happily back to sleep and the rest of us have to put up with him banging around the front door
C	yeah and I did say to her like families live together all the time you know parents work nightshifts and stuff and it works and you don't wake each other up because
B	marvellous
A	so I just I just found the whole attitude really strange
B	but I haven't heard him for ages
A	mm
B	no I haven't heard him
C	mm
B	out front
C	I'll tell you what I thought was really spineless of him like he didn't say I'm sorry or I didn't realise I was waking you up
A	yeah right
C	just he just stood there above the stairs like hiding and I mean I know it was an awkward conversation
A	mm
C	it shouldn't have been actually Anna was very immature when she handled that conversation
B	mm
C	she didn't accept responsibility
A	mm
C	passive aggressive really
A	yeah
C	but you would think although he felt awkward he might say do you know what it's actually me that's getting up
B	mm
A	mm
C	that would have been end of convo
B	I don't think it's not that much to ask you know if he leaves his bike out there you know
A	no because
B	yeah
A	so it makes no difference whatsoever
B	yeah
A	no one's gonna rob us between half four and half five
B	no
C	yeah
B	mm
C	they're dirty go ahead
A	disco duck
C	Don't take the disco duck
C	mm
B	yeah it's not a major problem leaving that door open at all
A	it's maximum two hours
C	mm hm
B	yeah
C	I mean to be fair if someone comes in we'd fucking hear him you'd be up
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
C	no one's gonna rob you at that time cos they think people are getting up for work
A	mm
B	yeah
C	which we are really so we'd hear them
A	for sure
C	mm
B	we are all early birds it's annoying that you know there's a few people that get up earlier than some which is quite frustrating
A	mm
B	you know
C	especially the weeks when I'm not to be at work till ten
B	mm
C	that's a piss take
A	it's a killer isn't it really? It's so hard because the house is only designed for like what? Three people?
B	yeah
A	it would originally have been a three bedroomed house
C	yeah
A	so maximum
C	mm hm
A	so really to have five adults possibly six seven eight depending on who's staying here
A	yeah
A	there's just too many people for one small space
C	mm
B	completely
C	although I've only ever heard you in the whole time being here I've heard you twice and I've never heard you
A	really?
C	in how many months has that been?
B	that's pretty good going
A	we've been here six months
C	isn't it? That's a pretty good going
B	I do try and be quiet you know even
A	eh hmm
C	I think it was the door that was waking me up you know
A	I've slept so much better this week
C	yeah
A	I don't wake up in the morning now because of that door
C	no
A	so it obviously was the banging that we were hearing
B	mm
C	I don't think I really
A	mm
C	that it was that that was waking me up it obviously was
A	that night when I went mental at you two cos you woke me up the first night second night
C	mm
A	that was the problem
C	oh yes
A	and drank a bottle of wine
C	I remember yeah
A	fucking alcoholic
B	oh yeah
A	well like cos it was because your mate your mate kept going in and out of the kitchen door so in your head you're like that's really good we're keeping the door closed no one will wake up
C	mm
A	because the door's so noisy obviously that's what you hear
B	yeah
A	I think now that we've taken the hinge off
C	yeah
A	which
B	yeah as long as you as long as you keep the the clip in the door
C	ooh and I found out today during my fire safety training she can't kick off to us about taking it off
A	it's illegal to have open anyway isn't it?
C	it's not a fire door It's not a fire door If it was a fire door it should be a heavy duty door and that's just wood
A	not window
C	yeah
A	well the hinge I think might have made it heavy duty
C	oh did it?
B	it's a solid door
A	but the hinge always uses the catch and it was so it made it heavy cos it was a heavy weight
B	no
C	is it?
B	yeah
A	but the thing is she's complicit because she knows that we could
C	no you can't
A	I've never seen I've never seen

B	it's got metal in it
A	it's pretty heavy like if you think about it when you've got the hinge on it
B	it's a proper fire door
A	but the thing is she knows that we've always kept that propped open
C	mm
A	so she really can't complain
B	no
A	to be honest it probably was there when she bought it and she probably doesn't give two hoots
C	yeah

A	but I like the you know the bed itself
C	yeah

A	A week?
B	two weeks
A	two weeks
B	two weeks
C	I mean I understand you have been spending quite a lot of time together
B	it feels it feels
A	it feels longer cos you're seeing her all the time
B	no not only that it's like when we're with each other as well you know it it it feels like we've known each other for years
C	oh
B	which is really really great as far as I'm concerned
A	oh
C	does she dress as cool as I do? Like hip?
B	em
A	no one is as cool as you
B	put it this way
A	you're being so diplomatic
B	put it this way
C	you're telling me I don't look hot in my scrubs? Think very carefully
A	silence
B	but
C	well I think I look hot in my scrubs
B	so you know
A	what's all this carry on this this is this is what I
A	I particularly like this aspect to your
C	man I'm so hot
A	you look like someone's about to hang you up
B	I compliment you
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so that's okay
C	I mean the best part is that only you lot get to this
A	but to be fair you're in your own home you should be able to get to wear whatever the hell you like
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and it's not that bad
C	like at work they take the mick when I wore my um cos I got to wear the uniform didn't I? So I wore trousers and a shirt for the first time and everyone went nuts at work
B	uniform
C	suit uniform? Same thing you've got on
A	yeah
C	Cos I'm the only one that wears a dress apart from the receptionist and they have to wear like a long coat over the top
A	oh god
C	em I was like yeah shirt and trousers
B	in all fairness I think it looks better you wearing a shirt and trousers
C	yeah
B	Cos it it gives variety of colour
A	it's more of a uniform as well isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that dress just looks too much of a school girl dress I think
C	oh good
B	personally
C	I call it my granny dress but you call it school girl dress if you like
A	mm
C	it's gonna get
A	ah she's come good then
C	yeah
B	at the end of the day a uniform's a uniform isn't it?
C	yeah
A	well the idea of uniform is that you all look the same whereas you're just rocking out whatever the hell you want to wear
C	yeah
A	eh hmm
C	she was like fine order the dress
A	oh amazing
C	yeah
A	oh
C	it's not the buses though so
B	there's going to be a long pause on your dictaphone

A	how do we know it's not a cat cos it's only got one of each?
B	it's a direct straight line
A	oh
B	yeah it's a close up
A	that's another gap
B	that's a that's a big span
A	yeah
B	that's in the back garden
A	that's our back garden? Em
B	it's really weird
A	could be a fox um
C	though we're in a bit of a built-up area to see foxes aren't we?
B	yeah you do get city foxes
A	but they like urban areas don't they cos the bins have got good pickings

A	luxury comedy or something
C	have you watched it? It's shit
