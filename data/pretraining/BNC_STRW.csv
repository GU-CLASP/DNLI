A	it was on last week
B	oh right
A	but why is it on again?

A	it was definitely on last week cos
B	oh right
A	he was saying oh it's such a good film
B	it's rubbish
B	fernGully is fine
A	but that's weird
B	Cos they've paid for it now
A	Good grief

A	but that's that's that's just an unusual thing to do
B	but a week apart is a bit

B	I mean I know money is a bit of an er issue with local
A	mm
B	advertising but still
A	it is usually er local companies that make their own
B	I think that I when I look at how much money we spend on DVDs and photo shoots and stuff
A	mm
B	and our products don't look like that
A	mm
B	and we're a charity
A	ooh what's that?
