A	there we are hello
B	I was sat hello hello
A	there we are
B	erm no I was sat on the balcony on Tuesday for hours reading and
A	very good
B	I just needed the sun
A	yeah
B	and it was so nice and I thought I can't believe it feels like spring
A	mm
B	and then today it's like no
A	I know
B	and I checked the weather again and it's like up and down up and down and then snow scheduled next Friday as well
A	yeah but it's funny though cos it'll say snow and then the day will roll round and it'll be rain
B	mm mm
A	but last night's snow was forecast but I just couldn't believe it when it actually appeared
B	no I know
A	it's just so weird going from fourteen degrees to I think there was probably three or four inches last night
B	yeah and it's not it wasn't even that cold I don't think I didn't think it was below zero
A	no
B	yeah mm random I'm just
A	yeah sun and rest I should think
B	just for
A	mm so
B	so
A	when are you off at you've got today off are you taking?
B	no I'm in for three hours from four to seven just doing mock speaking exams
A	yeah
B	cancelled my one to one's yeah it's just like asking questions
A	okay
B	it's really not a lot erm
A	no god no you're sick
B	but
A	mm
B	and I was thinking about it I was like I've never taken time off work apart from once when I was nineteen and I fell down some stairs in a nightclub and broke my nose
B	cos I'd drank like a bottle of gin straight
A	oh that'll do it
B	er and then had to my I couldn't even speak my friend had to phone it was when I worked at a clothes shop at uni my friend had to go she just can't come in today cos she's just broken her nose and she's got two black eyes and her face is full of cuts
B	so she'll be off for about a week
B	and I thought I've never taken time off apart from that er and you know I just feel a bit of a wuss like it's er it's only a cold
A	I'd say it speaks more of a lack of self-love
B	do you think?
A	not wishing to pass on any judgement
B	no go on
A	but yeah cos I feel if you love yourself and respect yourself sufficiently then you really want to take good care of the physical human organism your consciousness occupies for a short period of time
B	mm mm
A	and you take care of it and you nurture it and if it's not functioning right you give it what it needs until it does which is usually rest
B	yeah
A	and I think that's why the
B	I think that's the problem
A	or even just
B	mm mm
A	but it could be just watching Netflix sending emails
B	yeah
A	fiddling about on Facebook whatever sitting on the balcony reading a book when it's not full of snow
B	mm mm mm mm
A	yeah
B	yeah I know but I think it's just tricky I find it really hard
A	so
B	yeah
A	and there's this perception that you need to martyr yourself to every role and
B	and here I think it's completely different
A	yeah
B	if you're sick you don't go to work and in England I you know I was sort of talking about this on Twitter the other day like if you're in an office
A	mm
B	but then if you're in work and you've got a cold people are like oh god this person's sniffing the whole time
A	yeah
B	so you can't win
A	you can't win so you might as well do what gives you your greatest joy
B	whatever you want yeah
A	yeah
B	but I I
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	but then people get sick so the organisation really expects that that's gonna happen
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er
A	and I imagine there are a lot of people who want the extra money
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	so
A	so you might even be doing somebody a favour
A	let's face it the Christmas card credit card bills have just come in
B	true
A	there are probably Polish people going fuck how am I going to pay this?
B	yeah and it was winter break and they had were underpaid so
A	and then ta da
B	yeah true
A	they'd probably be full of gratitude hooray
B	hooray oh thank you thank you
A	I think it all works out though
B	no I think it'll be fine and by Monday hopefully I'll be right as rain I'm just really pissed off because I was doing everything right I was like
A	describe right
B	well I was eating right drinking right going to the gym being like sort of really positive
A	mm
B	and like we talked about this loads I was like in a really good frame of mind and I'm just so annoyed that I feel like I've been set back
A	yeah
B	you know and it'll take some time to get back to that point
A	but I I think I said to you in a Whatsapp message I I do wonder is this like the final purge of all of that shit that you've been through in December
B	mm
A	and this just might be everything just coming out now
B	yeah
A	cos it's gotta have it's release at some point so if you've been doing all of the stuff that helps your body
B	mm mm
A	and helps your mind and helps you know every aspect of you then it's it's just I don't know I do see it as that purging process it's that getting it all out
B	mm mm mm mm yeah part of the recovery
A	and with lungs you know you'll be coughing it all up that's quite literal really of getting out that which is within and no longer serves you
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	we'll see anyway tell me tales
A	tell you tales well since I saw you last erm on Thursday
B	mm
A	I flew back to Belfast erm
B	mm mm
A	and whose funeral it was on the Friday
B	oh okay
A	erm
B	mm mm mm mm
A	and I presumed all my friends in nern ern as I want to call it Northern Ireland
B	mm mm
A	would be with their families and would be having work parties
B	mm mm
A	and be a little bit busy erm
B	mm mm
A	and so smiley as well I miss that smileyness of Northern Ireland
B	mm mm
A	and
B	mm mm
A	er so it was a Presbyterian church erm funeral
B	yeah really soon mm mm
A	yeah but I was so glad to be there to sort of offer my support to
B	mm nice
A	and a a big feast and then some people went off to the grave ordinarily the grave comes first
B	mm mm
A	and the feast comes afterwards but they decided to do it the other way around cos the weather was so shit and people had travelled from far and wide and were heading back again so yeah then they went off to the graveyard and the mud and the torrential rain
B	right
A	jeez it rained I'd forgotten I'd forgotten about the wind and the rain and
B	mm mm
A	and I feel really warm and I know I've got the clothes for it in Northern Ireland it's sort of six seven degree but fuck I was cold
B	yeah it feels colder
A	oh my god I shivered my way around there and houses are colder so every night I was wearing socks and er thick trousers a fleece
B	mm mm
A	just just freezing so even though technically on paper it's warmer with the icy winds and the cold houses
B	mm mm mm mm
A	it's just so cold so that was a bit of a wake up call reminder erm oh yeah and on Friday night went to the theatre erm there's a lovely little theatre in
B	nice
A	do you know the Julie Walters original?
B	no I
A	yeah definitely put it on the list
B	but it's a long list
A	well it was fantastic rather than you know the Julie Walter's character being working class Liverpool in the film this was working class Belfast
B	nice
A	and the character was fantastic and sounded just like people I used to work with
B	ah ha ha
A	erm which made me laugh as well and some of the things she was coming out with and facial expressions I thought yeah I know people just like you it's funny
B	mm
A	erm
B	what people you knew or just people saying hello?
A	yeah well random people I used to work in the off licence there for a few months
B	right
A	so I think I probably knew them from there knew their faces but it's the sort of place where you know all of the familiar faces around town
B	yeah
A	and it's like everybody is so smiley hi how are you? you know little comment on the weather
B	mm mm mm mm
A	really ah I just thought oh god it feels like home and it does and it
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and my colleagues you know I worked with loads of sort of quite young teenagers and they were like why?
A	yeah
B	it's nice that's part of the job I suppose
A	yeah
B	no and it's not to make money it was just
A	it's just yeah it's social
B	mm mm
A	and you end up knowing people's life stories and things like that and yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I used to get people bang on the window and wave or bang on the window and pull faces
B	yeah
A	that was a lovely little job and I took that that was erm after
B	mm mm
A	but I came to realise I absolutely bloody love it so for all of my intellectual capabilities and all of the business roles that I've performed in the you know business suit high powered nonsense I've been through
B	mm mm
A	I think fuck it actually I really enjoy retail work in a small community environment
B	mm mm
A	where there's no stress and very little sales pressure or sales pressure you can ignore quite successfully erm
B	mm mm
A	and I love bringing order to chaos
B	yeah
A	you know order comes in put it away shop looks lovely clean tidy beautiful something so satisfying about that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no sort of of god I've got to do this for tomorrow
A	yeah
B	you know your free time is really your free time you don't have to worry about anything
A	yeah phone's not gonna ring
B	no er and my friend
A	nice
B	so he has his headphones on he's just you know the stuff comes in ready he just puts it in the oven takes it out of the oven and then he just does a couple of hours behind the tills the same people come in at the same time every day to buy the same things
A	yeah yeah
B	you know it's just like a man who buys like a packet of cigarettes and two cans of Red Bull or something
A	yeah
B	yeah er so like I I'm just so envious the first two hours he just listens to music listens
A	yeah
B	so
B	like he just finds like the joy you know? the funniest things in this job
A	yeah
B	and then the trust is just
A	yeah it's social it's friendly it's
B	you know the same people every day
A	human interaction yeah I used to get the same people as well cos we were the only off licence for miles around
B	mm mm
A	so yeah even the local people with alcohol issues who might in a city potential be aggressive from time to time they just weren't
B	mm mm
A	because they knew that if they were barred from your shop they've got a seven or eight mile walk to the next one
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	the next place they can buy booze so
B	mm mm
A	and I just used to say to him I don't think that's any way to talk and I think maybe you'd better leave if you're going to carry on like that
B	mm mm
A	he'd be full of apologies I think it was part of the sort of power play to see what he could get away with
B	mm mm
A	but
B	a man used to go into
A	only Uncle Ben's?
B	I can't remember the whole story but he was like that man came in again
B	ah
A	what did he do with the rice?
B	I don't know whether they just threw it away or they had to like make the man buy it
A	yeah
B	oh god there's like the funniest characters
A	yeah
B	mm
A	down in
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah well I don't know like at my house at home we lock the door but there's like a key in a really obvious place
A	yeah
B	so I don't know I suppose everyone well lots of people have spare keys under
A	mm under the mat under the flowerpot
B	yeah we've got one on the shelf but erm
A	yeah
B	just have to sort of trust it I used yeah I never locked the door when I used to like take the dog for a walk and stuff like that
A	mm mm
B	or in the countryside where no one ever visits
A	yeah
B	mm mm big windows
A	as much light and air as possible just let it in love it and it was weird seeing my home all dark
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	what's the word? I find it's it depends where you live of course but people who's
A	mm
B	mm mm mm mm mm mm
B	we used to joke that he'd like pull a muscle in his leg for the amount of times he's like duck off to look out of the window
B	oh oh who's there? well it must be three o'clock cos it's
A	that's brilliant
B	yeah it's funny
A	yeah so we had Indian takeaway
B	nice
A	which was lovely oh my god Indian oh it's so good
B	no I know we've not been for Chinese either
A	no
B	but I'm not really in to Chinese as much
A	no I miss Indian though
B	oh nice
A	erm and yeah people were just sort of wandering in bringing alcohol with them it was kind of nice really and then
B	mm mm
A	so I think it's done my soul good to be back in that that love
B	mm mm
A	wind and rain oh my god no
A	yeah if it was a little Mediterranean climate
B	yes
A	then I could be tempted but jeez being so cold and I think it's the wind that does my head in
B	mm
A	so I can imagine spending time there again for a few years
B	oh that's nice
A	isn't that lovely? so
B	yeah new hobby
A	yeah and meeting people and things like that so I thought no that'd be I'd I'd definitely do that
B	mm mm
A	and it was their play this weekend so everyone was getting quite excited about the play they were putting on
B	on nice
A	it was good
B	oh
B	uhu
A	erm very nice woman forty-eight years old a gardener an artist a sculptor
B	oh
A	erm it was very interesting but no spark unfortunately
B	sad
A	yeah
B	sad sad
A	yeah
B	ah ha ha
A	but yeah
B	mm it's funny what you say about you know going back and feeling sort of loved and appreciated
A	mm
B	and I think it's because we're all in our
A	mm
B	away and come back
A	yeah
B	erm so it's not like there's any sort of feeling of loss I suppose when you go
A	mm
B	and any particular feeling of return because everyone's always
A	yeah everyone's doing it there's not a core of people who are always there
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	in the same houses in the same jobs
B	so you really sort of
A	yeah
B	er which is you know it's not a bad thing but sort of I'm sort saying it in a sort of selfish way but it's just a sort of different situation I suppose
A	mm
B	yeah so they're settled
A	yeah
B	they're in the same place and when someone leaves that community it's much more obvious
A	yeah
B	erm
A	whereas with your age group
B	what I mean there's sort of
A	there's the leaving for uni thing and then there's leaving for various jobs thing
B	yeah and there's no
A	yeah
B	I suppose
A	yeah and I guess over the next decade for you and your friends there's gonna be the getting married and having babies thing
B	yeah so I anticipate really in the next ten years a lot of people will come back home
A	mm
B	they've been to London or they've been abroad or whatever
A	mm
B	I think so
A	do you equate a relationship with putting down roots in a particular geographical location?
B	I don't associate relationship with anything to do with me so
B	so
A	completely independent no idea
B	so I don't know er
A	mm
B	but maybe that's just because that's what
A	mm
B	yes
A	and that I guess is where moving about can cause disruption
B	mm mm yeah especially for kids in schools yeah for sure
A	the small people
B	yeah interesting
A	mm
B	anyway we've got Valentine's day to look forward to so that's something
A	oh haven't we just
B	er I haven't
A	what?
B	er
A	ah
B	let me just show you this
A	yeah no wi-fi last night what was that all about?
B	oh you poor thing
A	I know I was panicking for a bit thinking
A	cos I've got a flat roof I think I me and my neighbour have the only flat roofs in the whole of Poland everybody else has these real steep angled roofs so the snow can fall off
B	yeah yeah yeah so you're the snow was erm
A	yeah and actually I dunno why I'm thinking that I'm just presuming there's something on the roof that has my email signal
A	so true
B	ah there's a few things on here that I just thought you'd like
A	ah
B	I love owls
A	yeah I used to see barn owls a lot at my uncle's house and at my brother's house and they've both got erm well they both live in the country where you've got a big long straight road with fields either side and my theory was that at dusk or after dark the owl ah little fox
B	he thinks the bedding is snow
A	ah he's trying to find something to eat in there ah that's cute
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	yeah that's my theory anyway
B	erm
A	have you?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	I text oh I emailed him this morning saying I'm gonna have to cancel for tomorrow and he's like it's okay I was gonna cancel too because I'm ill
A	maybe they gave it to you
B	my trainer gave it to me
A	ah
B	bastard
A	is probably what it is
B	not really
B	so I had to cancel that as well so I was really pissed off like ah
A	mm
B	what a horrible word
A	well I know it was it was awful and I'm sure there's plenty going on in the jacuzzi and the sauna that you just really don't want to know about
B	er
A	and I had it was not too far from the fire station and I had a fireman chat me up one day and I just thought no
B	what firemen?
A	well
B	oh
A	mm
A	that's alright you snot away
B	oh god my nose is so sore
A	yeah
B	yeah I've been using
A	yeah
B	which is really moisturising moisturiser and Vaseline I've got
A	good
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah or E45 things like that
A	no yeah so do you need anything next few days?
B	no I don't I don't know I don't think so
A	mm
B	I've just gotta wait it out I think
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's annoying because it's like deceptive I think I probably sort of sound okay and I can do lots of things but
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's bad at night but
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but we'll see what happens
A	yeah anything white according to that Chinese medicine book good for lungs some mushrooms
B	yeah
A	horseradish
A	yeah
B	just don't think there's a lot of white food out there
A	there's not a huge amount is there?
B	as I said at the time marshmallows
A	marshmallows
B	marshmallows and vanilla ice cream
A	yay
B	er
A	is there anything you're craving?
B	no
A	no
B	radish white meats white mushrooms
A	cool what are you reading at the moment?
B	er I've been reading a lot of young adult stuff at the moment
A	mm
B	er which I really like I think more people should read young adult fiction for sure
A	mm
B	erm so at the moment I'm reading a book called Am I Normal Yet?
A	mm mm
B	and she's on the road to recovery but she keeps relapsing and she doesn't want to tell anybody cos she doesn't want to disappoint her parents
A	mm
B	er so yeah it's it's nice
A	I wonder if everybody has thoughts and feeling like that at that young age I certainly did and I had a therapist for years when I was a teenager I mean particularly sort of ages I don't know thirteen plus
B	mm mm
A	cos my mum left when I was six and I think that you know upset my relationships and how I was generally erm and I thought it was bloody brilliant and I sort of came out of that experience thinking my god everybody should have counselling
B	I really think that everybody should have counselling
A	yeah and I think it's almost the same people that that do because you're confronting these things
B	uhu
A	and then I saw somebody again when I was about sixteen no seventeen eighteen
B	yeah
A	I had a relationship that ended and I felt like shit for a while
B	I've been wanting a therapist
A	I'm sure you can
B	but I really need to do something about it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I bet you can
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	well I've tried sort of asking a question and then kind of mind mapping it on a piece of paper with arrows and why why why why why why?
A	mm
B	to try and sort of find a conclusion and I just sort of write all of this stuff and don't find a conclusion
A	yeah
A	maybe there is no conclusion maybe the process is the healing
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	don't know don't know
A	and you can ask for help at the risk of sounding a little crazy you can ask for help from your guides and from you know those who are the other side of the veil who are here to guide and look after you and from your higher self cos they've got a rule of free will a rule of non-interference so they're not allowed to interfere in your life you have to say
B	even if you ask
A	come on guys could do with a little help here please and then they can help but you have to ask
B	mm
A	so that's the law
B	the law what are you reading?
A	I'm reading The Law of One which is all about er the law of one is basically the law of it's kind of unity consciousness that we are all drops in the ocean of god or the creator or whatever you want to call it and it's kind of interesting it goes off on some UFO tangents which I find a little bit boring cos I suppose I've been there done that when I was younger I was all into paranormal oh UFOs and oh aliens and now I just my understanding is that we have sort of star brothers and sisters and cousins
B	mm mm
A	I think it's quite arrogant of humanity to think otherwise to imagine we're the only intelligent ho ho erm
B	mm mm
A	in this infinite multiverse erm so yeah I think we have these sort of other intelligences that are around us that you don't necessarily perceive on a physical level but can perceive on other levels and now I suppose I've had so many years and taking them for granted and just thinking oh yeah you know extraterrestrial being
B	uhu
A	consciousness whatever I kind of see them all of part of this oneness as well I see all of physicality sort of third dimensional reality as part of physicality and I see this kind of as a stage on which we come to meet challenges and to learn life lessons for the evolution of self which is the evolution of all
B	I'm a huge advocate of time
A	yeah I know
B	er funny
A	yeah I still think about you and your express train and ending up on the slow bus
B	just basically to have an hour in my whole life
A	and then getting the six hour train home
B	god
A	oh god that's so funny
B	it's funny
A	I haven't yet erm because I've crammed all of River which I found on the USA Netflix

A	excellent
B	but it still has
A	oh fuck's sake
B	I know I was like stop raping

A	I know
B	uhu
A	and she uses a French letting thing
B	oh so it's running through like an agency?
A	kind of but I think she's her own agency and there's standard contracts and things
B	uhu
A	erm
B	right
A	and very common in French lets and when French people hire holiday homes from another French person in France
B	uhu
A	they get this special waiver form thing
B	right
A	from their insurer that just says yes you're covered for this place
B	uhu
A	as well and Trip Advisor also suggested that anybody who has gone back to their potential owner and said er
B	right
A	so I've emailed to go er
B	uhu
A	if she doesn't I could potentially lose my deposit because it's not gonna be cost effective to
B	mm mm
A	insure a place like that
B	somewhere else that's so weird
A	nuts
B	yeah to be kind of premature I guess
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	before I do things like that and for some reason I didn't I think it was the disruption the funeral kind of getting in the way cos I was
B	yeah and sort of rushing it through I guess

B	uhu
A	Portugal Spain somewhere warm for winter and he said right here's what you do head on down to Italy get the boat to Sardinia and drive your van around Sardinia and mm well there are worse places to go but
B	come to
A	yeah
B	or in the sort of mountain regions near
A	year cos I think of
B	no
A	who are there on all inclusive package deals
B	no
A	no?
B	no
B	yeah
A	that package holiday and I I know people who do it who just go and stay drunk on the beach for a fortnight
B	yeah
A	and that's fine if that floats their boat but I don't want to be hanging out in that environment so
B	mm mm
A	oh good I'm glad you're going good

A	yeah
B	I mean like eating your evening meal after ten PM I just think I'll be bed though
