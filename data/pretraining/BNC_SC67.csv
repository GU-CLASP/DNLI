B	yeah
C	it must just turn up again this time
A	yeah that is part of
B	you were like you went through stages of grief
C	beside myself
B	with your phone
C	I was beside myself
B	first you were in denial then you were like manic
B	and it was so funny
B	like it was
A	did she go through like the what is it? the seven stages of grief?
B	yeah
A	like what is it?
B	what are they?
C	you know what it was? you know?

A	on the on the
B	so we were just like erm like

A	was he hot?

C	I mean no we'd been like seeing each other
A	oh right okay
C	yeah yeah
B	what? you mean you were like just getting it out of your system?
A	mm mm
C	oh yeah I mean yeah I definitely think it was like getting it out of the system and I think as well it was like at a quite good point to like finish it but you know when you're like you like hadn't quite done the
A	mm mm
C	so it was like I was like robbed from me the opportunity to do it
A	it's quite satisfying losing something like that though
C	erm yeah
A	I would've thought
B	and then we went to a weird er festival on
A	you stole my fork?
B	and we were wondering like the whole context was really weird though cos I'd been staying with them on that weekend cos I met this guy at a festival
B	who I thought was great and like basically the year before the
A	that was just a fucking weird Swedish person
B	did you meet him? yeah you met him at that dinner party
A	mm but no no I wasn't there but you told us about him like they wore
B	yeah
A	and you definitely thought he was gay
B	so anyway so he was so he was hanging out that weekend
A	okay
B	and this was the point when his grandma had died we didn't know this yet but his grandma had died
A	what?
B	while he was like while he was here
C	and I'm like I'm like selfishly just grieving my phone
B	the whole thing
A	shut up

C	yeah it's also the first bit of that walk is not very nice it's like on the A it's like on the
A	fucking hell
B	it's like you walk like the most direct route to
C	is to walk to

A	yeah
B	yeah
C	so you walk like along so you don't actually
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	don't get as as as far north as
B	and it's
A	maybe then
C	no I tried so many
A	she could've
unknown_female	oh is it?
A	I dunno it's on
B	wait what is it? what what is it? what is the marker for?
A	it marks the end of the square mile
C	it's
B	ah
C	er and the
B	is that why it's called
A	well it
C	it marks a mile away from the city the city of
A	a mile away from the city yeah
C	and the reason is because to do with disease
A	oh so like people wouldn't be able to go into the city if they were diseased or wouldn't be able to leave yeah
C	so if they yeah so if they so when it was like the business
A	yeah well yeah
C	different kind of yeah er it was like where like er lots of people lots of like it was like when the like
B	why?
A	so they were out of the city
C	so they were out so they were like kind of in an er
A	quarantined
C	quarantine
B	that sounds awful
C	I know
B	huh?
B	yeah
C	they're like bad anti
B	I'm really worried about what David Cameron said today
A	set them on fire
C	oh my god I know me too
B	yesterday
A	oh
B	so bad about giving
A	English as a second language?
B	yeah the test but
A	integration
unknown_female	test
B	test for Muslim women
C	no no but
B	so fucked up
C	he said giving
C	he said giving Muslim women the opportunity to learn English because so that it's so that they could so that they could erm
B	he says it's empowerment
C	that they could
unknown_female	it's so fucked up
B	it was like he was just like he was just like making all these shit
A	it's fucking
B	I forgot about that we're we're
A	erm
B	did she? quite right
A	yeah but it's it's fucking abhorrent absolutely abhorrent
C	it's outrageous
unknown_female	it's
B	also what a fucking awful thing to say as
A	cos at the end of the day there's
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	who never learnt English
C	yeah
A	and you know how many fucking things did they blow up?
B	I like hated that he's claimed it as empowerment as well
B	that was what was so pernicious about it
C	it's also like an
A	and also
C	and also why the fuck are you linking it to to like radicalisation? like it's like outrageous
A	cos everything has to be linked to radicalisation
B	it's just opportunism
C	I don't think I don't think that does I don't think that does like aid like integration that saying things like that
A	no not him saying it but you know like the
C	oh yeah the idea of it sure
A	in France there's like
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	whereas in Britain we've always celebrated like you know?
C	the diversity?
A	yeah diversity and like
C	yeah
B	well the thing is like
A	and part of it's like and I think that's more for the better like
B	but one of the interesting things is
A	it's less it's less
B	there's like isn't there the same number of like you've got the same problems in both societies?
A	yeah
B	and that is quite interesting like I think it's like I think it's like we have to stop being like I think it's like it's not about how well people have
A	and
B	and like yeah disenfranchised and like
A	and uneducated and
C	and I also think it's I also think it's
B	yeah
A	mm
B	no
A	yeah but the thing is that even if you even if you hold on to like your Pakistani or er like whatever identity you should still be very happy with the fact that you're British like the idea of
unknown_female	yeah
C	but I'm
A	mm
B	I know but
C	but they've both both like some some people might deal with one system some people might
C	but there's always gonna be people that
A	mm
C	that don't don't fit into either
B	I think but I think it is important
A	but the thing there's more posh people I can't understand than Pakistanis
C	mm?
A	there's more posh people I can't understand than Pakistanis
C	yeah of course
C	also so erm
C	so so you know the
A	yeah
A	yeah where is she
C	oh she works for
A	yeah so she er she's the er
C	women
A	undersecretary for in for like what do they do? department of
C	yeah yeah yeah DFIDs yeah
C	well no well no it's only because
C	it's only because it's only because there was a I saw on I saw on Twitter yesterday I got confused there's a woman called
C	yeah that's not the
B	she's Tory as well isn't she?
A	I thought she was Labour
B	no she's Tory no the person that
A	yeah
B	okay
C	but she had but she had a really interesting to say she was saying about her like her
A	yeah
C	she was saying that her mum's English isn't that good but she like has four sisters and they're all like in really kind of brilliant jobs she's like
B	yeah
C	she's you know she's like I'm a like er I'm a I'm a minister like my sister's a lawyer
B	I just think
C	yeah
A	state wasn't willing to recognise
unknown_female	yeah
A	the fact she didn't speak English so she was in prison for years
C	yeah
A	because er nobody would actually
unknown_female	who's that?
C	oh
A	and she murdered her she killed her partner and it was
C	fuck
A	murder but then for years and years and years she was in prison was held well past her
unknown_female	in the UK?
A	in the UK yeah and was in
C	why was she held past her parole date? that's surely a breach of
C	yeah
A	the perfect criminal she
C	I see okay
A	but she never showed remorse in the eyes of the parole board because she was speaking in her second language
C	ah
A	so
C	so she couldn't
A	even though she spoke English well she couldn't
C	empathise?
A	well no in fact she couldn't articulate the empathisation so
C	in the way that they wanted yeah yeah yeah that's so interesting
A	so if people going did you kill him? she's like yes I killed him like do you think it was the right thing to do? yes where she couldn't articulate the fact that yes I thought it was the right thing to do because I was in an abusive relationship
C	oh god
B	that's so interesting
A	I didn't want my daughter to abuse be abused so I killed him
C	wow
A	to save our family and it was also a self-defence thing so actually
B	that's amazing
A	and her mum came up and said this is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous er
C	also like why
B	yeah
C	why why did it take so long for
B	and then what happened?
A	because people confused her cos they were like you must speak English you must speak English you must speak English
C	oh my god
A	and she did speak English she spoke good English but she couldn't
B	I just think it must be really
C	that's so fucked
C	yeah for sure
A	so like people who are bilingual actually very good at erm distance erm distinguishing
C	yeah right
A	so when so if you wanna distance yourself from an emotion say you're making a big business deal even if you're doing the deal in your main language you'll think in your second language
B	that's so interesting
A	it's cos you are naturally more emotive in one language than the other
B	that's so interesting
C	but why if but if even if you're doing it in your in your first language why would you emote in the second language?
A	you
C	oh right
A	if you don't wanna be emotive where it's subconsciously er
C	then you can then you can
A	then you would just be in the other language
C	that's so interesting
B	it's just so it's such a strange kind of
C	I don't think if he read any books
B	family
C	I don't think he'd
B	but like you like as you say it's just understanding
A	did you send a message to my phone?
unknown_female	what?
A	oh
C	hilarious
B	erm
C	go on the
B	er yeah he
C	mm?
B	and they
A	yeah
B	and the parents couldn't and it suddenly was this really weird and very poisonous
A	yeah
B	dynamic then for the family it was difficult because like
C	cos you're cos you can keep things from the parents?
C	oh god
B	and no sorry I remembered
B	no no I just couldn't remember
A	why? what was the original?
C	another story we were talking about
B	no shut up
C	she was like ah there was this family that came over I think it was from Ireland
C	I think I read about it
A	yeah that dangerous country where they can't speak English
A	oi top of the morning to you there
A	mm
B	cos his grandparents like like were very stuck in their ways and they were like in their you know forties and fifties and they couldn't readjust to it and they found
A	yeah
B	like the whole thing really traumatic and stressful
C	yeah
B	and like they didn't pick up but the kids picked it up and there was this kind of like strange so poor relationship and you have to understand like the complexity of human beings going through that sort of shit
A	mm
B	like families leaving Syria who never wanted to leave in the first place
C	yeah yeah yeah totally
B	and like even if you're leaving for economic reasons and like you've had to move because you're like people don't actually often particularly wanna be here
A	people don't wanna leave home they don't wanna leave home
C	there aren't yeah there aren't
B	they don't wanna leave home
C	yeah you're right there aren't
B	yeah and it's just like it's so inhumane
C	there aren't that but there aren't that many there aren't that many people that that er that that yeah I mean in terms of the amount of people that come
B	economic
C	there aren't that many people that come through choice
B	like because they have to and they learn because they have to and if you're an economic migrant who can't speak English then you're fucked like if you're a Romanian who can't speak English then you're not let on building sites and then
C	I also think yeah I also think I also think
B	and then if you're if you're here because you need to be and then like there's so much complexity in that like trying to learn a language at like twenty is hard trying to learn it at sixty is like next to impossible
C	well it's also it's not just
B	like
C	it's not just the language is it? it's like it's like the cultural differences right kind of?
A	mm
C	it's like that way like I mean it sounds really stupid but I like
B	yeah
C	but like but you
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	that isn't that inherent in other cultures
A	the absolute and the absolutely over thankful
C	yeah even if you yeah
A	fucking foreigners
C	yeah bit rude
B	yeah
C	and then I was suddenly like oh it's you know but it's like those like tiny nuances but imagine
B	yeah
C	if you can't even speak the language then you learn a language and you still don't get the social
B	have you worked have you worked out there was like that here come the Romanians is the
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	is it like the first?
C	there's another one there's another one that
A	really funny
B	it's so funny
A	yeah
B	but like I love like I love the like wry observation how weird it is
C	here come the Romanians
B	coming to the UK
A	yeah
B	like the guy the guy who comes he is he lives in that like mad house with like seven or eight or nine kids
A	yeah yeah
B	and he comes over and he was like what the fuck is going on here?
B	it's a really that's what I thought was like so clever about it is that it shines a mirror back up to like how weird it is coming from
A	yeah cos we consider it to be normal but at the same time it's
C	thank you
B	sorry thanks so much that was really nice thanks
A	I erm I watched a cheers
A	and it was all about like there was a series of them and like there was one like about the Canadians Ethiopians the French the Russians
unknown_female	fucking hell
A	and one about the British as well and it was really interesting cos obviously it was
unknown_female	yeah
A	it was really positive as well
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	cos it was the war and everything was positive
unknown_female	yeah
A	erm but it was really interesting to see that perspective on British
unknown_female	yeah
A	like
unknown_female	yeah
A	through a
unknown_female	yeah
A	foreigner's lens
unknown_female	yeah
A	and I'm reading this book er I've got this book I've not actually started reading it but I've got this book it's by a Hungarian guy on how to be a Brit
C	cool
A	by this Hungarian guy translated from Hungarian into English
C	so interesting
A	it's really funny but it's like
C	so interesting so good
B	the thing is like there's not like I
C	yeah it's yeah yeah the the the Sinclair one
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	er you would love it actually
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's like I'm gonna try I'm gonna order them so like I definitely wanna
B	really?
C	oh it's Keiller isn't it?
B	and he like basically it's like three films that are made in like the eighties
C	yeah you're right it's Patrick Keiller yeah yeah you're right
B	late eighties
A	mm
B	and it was kind of like he he's like a super leftie
C	I think you can get them I think you can get them online
