A	did that parcel turn up

A	yeah
B	yeah cos we were over there today and they didn't mention it

A	I paid three quid for my ticket
B	yeah I feel like if you're
A	well that's it innit?
B	jesus
A	probably yeah
B	but I think because it's a bank holiday it's busier
A	as the gates opened?
B	no as
A	erm
B	they literally we saw them open and then somebody came on to shift
B	he he
B	whereas normally I don't think they have them on on a Sunday
A	no
B	cos they don't pay for I reckon cos
A	that's what fucks
B	yeah
B	then they had er massive flagons of cider and
A	and you get
B	mm
A	was about six of them
B	from London?

A	obviously we went to
B	mm
A	I'm in
B	mm
A	and we got off at
B	mm
A	like me being me I
A	I said
B	mm

B	was he a
A	yeah he was
B	mm
A	I said I tell you what mate I'm coming back here in about half an hour

A	the road to the job centre I went
A	and he was still standing there

B	mm
A	but I didn't give a shit
B	mm
A	no they didn't have the bottle
B	no
A	fucking
B	maybe you are both blonde
A	but in two year
B	well there's a lot of blonde British people too
A	I ain't funny but when I'm out on my bike
B	people might yeah
A	yeah they think I'm fucking funny
B	cos they don't necessarily have cars or
A	well big
A	oh does your yeah
B	it's cos they they kinda dress a little bit like you two as well
A	but that's what they do try and blend in don't they?
B	they like a beer or two
A	but for for us British who are
B	I mean they might be doing the same as well
A	fucking
B	oh yeah
A	no it was about two years ago
B	oh
A	every fortnight
B	every fortnight
A	but I think eventually it's gonna be all done on er
B	digitally yeah online
B	maybe they'll go in under something else
A	I mean you could you walk in there sometimes
B	surely though there's kinda like
A	half of them
B	mm
A	it's ridiculous
B	mm
A	they will stop your money for a fortnight
A	but if you turn up early
B	mm
A	then you're
B	mm
A	well probably gone on holiday or jacked her job in
B	mm
A	but literally if you're five ten minutes late that's it bang
B	yeah I mean
A	well it's not my money I haven't been paid for a nearly a month
B	no I know mum said
A	yeah that weren't me Giro
B	oh was that something else?
A	something else I applied for yeah
B	yeah
A	that was about sixty quid
B	certainly true
A	if it weren't for like for weren't for me being
B	yeah
A	I'd be fucking
B	skint
A	yeah
B	if you were to get custody of
A	oh god yeah he wouldn't even have to sign on
B	does she still get stuff for him even though she's got her inheritance
A	no
B	she's got too much money?
A	I mean she can't claim nothing at the moment
B	no cos they wanna see her bank statements
A	mm
B	I bet she doesn't wanna let anyone know what's in her bank
A	well about two years ago
B	what cos what does she get just what her dad's her parents' house was or?
A	I think she had about
B	in her account yeah
A	because they had to divvy up an house
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	but then they sold the house
B	she got half of that as well
A	but her brother
B	mm
A	and her
B	okay
A	so I think
B	did he re-mortgage it to release her half of the money?
A	something like that
A	she told me what about fucking six months ago she said it's fucking nearly gone
B	what's she been spending all that on?
A	takeaways hasn't she? you must see the size of her
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	oh no
A	I mean
B	has she put any
A	don't know
B	I hope so
A	she got a car motorbike
B	new car? do you reckon or like quite a modern one?
A	oh yeah yeah it's a late model for
B	mm
B	mm
A	lovely little motor fucking I'd like to have it
B	mm
A	what else she got? she's got fucking two ponds in her front garden
B	yeah
A	so she don't have to go there and mow it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	grassy stuff what's it called?
A	every time you walked to the front door it was like brand new grass
B	fuck man people
A	yeah
B	they just
A	she thinks of everything I'm telling you
B	what what was the point in spending your money on that eh?
B	just
A	yeah
B	does she? is she still entitled to having that even? I guess she is if it's not
A	well she pays the
B	pays the rent for it
A	you get a bedroom tax as well now
B	and so she has to pay for the extra bedroom that she gets yeah
A	well it's a three bedroom house
B	yeah
A	but once her inheritance goes
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	well you could've done
B	couple hundred grand
A	but she's got her own little
B	oh has she?
A	yeah she makes her own jewellery I mean
B	oh is she actually doing that?
A	what she does is good
B	cos she's always liked doing that hasn't she? yeah
A	she's actually good I mean she's a div
B	but she's
A	but what she does
B	yeah
A	well
B	she can keep that income on the side as well can't she?
A	she's ain't nearly strong enough to fucking stick
B	maintain anything
A	I think half of it she suffer suffers with her depression
B	mm
A	really bad
B	yeah
A	well the moment
B	oh
A	fucking nut and like
B	she always has been
A	he's
B	mm
A	I said I dunno mate
B	well
A	well yeah he'll be old enough
B	to do what
A	I don't
B	no like I say give him till secondary school
A	that's where he's at the moment
B	yeah he wants to go up to
B	I'm hoping they'll probably follow him a couple of years later
A	oh I suppose so yeah
B	I doubt they'll be going anywhere different
A	think he had enough of her already
B	mm
B	oh yeah mum said
A	that
B	yeah why why did he do that just to
B	yeah he is twenty now isn't he is he twenty?
A	oh he's
B	bloody hell
A	he's a fully grown man
B	whoa be really weird to see
B	I can only picture him as a ten year old
A	yeah
B	why did he
A	mm
B	he's twenty years old
A	he keeps saying to
B	I mean he's not the
A	he said to
B	why? why would he say that?
A	cos what his mum's been saying
B	yeah
A	and I've come cut through that

B	but even by
B	even if you just
A	yeah
B	just gotta ignore him
A	no ain't fucking
B	I mean
B	ah
A	someone starts shouting at me
B	no
A	that's the proof
B	yeah
A	I mean he got burgled
B	did he know who done it then?
A	pretty much
B	he's pretty sure about it
A	and I was willing to go up there to
B	yeah
A	cos I've never really had a problem with
B	where where is he?
A	then I go and he goes and does something stupid like that
B	yeah I don't know why he did that maybe he was feeling
A	well he's had it now
B	just being silly
A	oh no he
B	does where did he live do you know that still?
B	oh yeah

B	yeah
B	yeah
A	he probably weighs about eight or nine stone
B	oh he's not very big at all then is he?
B	I guess he's only twenty he'll fill out a bit more
A	I'd probably give him the back hand then you know what I mean
B	well he's not gonna do that anyway and you should never do that
A	I can't
B	not worth the time is it? you know what you know what would happen
A	I'd get arrested again
B	yeah
A	again
B	and
B	just let
A	fucking just minding my own business
A	I said what do you say you little mug?

B	well yeah I mean I guess you're not gonna get started on or anything are you? it's only twenty past nine
A	started on by who?
B	exactly you're not going to
A	give me something to do on the way home
B	no
A	oh I'll have one more beer
A	it goes quite well just gas
B	does it?
A	fucking don't last five minutes
B	oh that's alright then cos er my flat in Brighton
A	is it?
B	I thought it was gonna cost me more money I thought electricity was more expensive than gas
A	no well even
B	what does your hot water?
A	gas
B	do you shower down there now?
A	yeah
B	oh so it goes pretty quick then? what about your cooker? gas?
A	yeah
B	you
A	I don't I don't hardly use it I use the George Foreman now
B	yeah yeah
A	most of the time
B	see that's why I reckon
A	but the one
B	yeah
A	I've gone through about five in about three years
B	green mean grilling machining are you doing?
B	I go through three George Foremans in a year
A	I use them all the time
B	yeah yeah I know that's the nice thing they are healthier as well aren't they?
A	I mean I fucking grill slice potatoes out fucking put them on there
B	yeah yeah can you grill them on there?
A	yeah I do everything
B	how long does it take to do some potato on there?
A	what if you chop them up?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you
A	no they just come out like a sliced jacket potato
B	oh
B	just slice it up?
A	that's what it tastes like innit?
B	sounds good how long does it take to do that?
B	okay
A	once it's warmed up
B	yeah yeah
A	it cooks from both sides
B	just put
A	anything
B	it's true it cooks a sausage in like five minutes doesn't it?
A	yeah if you cut it about that thick
B	I'm gonna try that this week
A	oh I put everything on there
B	well not this week next week
A	fucking everything
A	fish fingers
B	can't put beans on it though can you?
A	no
B	runs off
A	I've got a microwave down there as well
B	yeah I've got a microwave yeah
A	yeah I use the cooker at the back
B	can't cook a curry on it
B	I like the idea of doing tatoes on it
A	about four chicken legs
B	mm
A	all of them was like that
B	mm
A	twenty minutes
B	mm
A	carrots
B	nice
A	I skin I skin the carrots
B	yeah peal the carrots
A	I left them whole
B	ah
A	about that long
B	did you slice them in half the carrots
A	yeah oh no no I left them on
B	oh
A	I just shut it down on that
B	how big is your George Foreman then?
A	and I done the new potatoes in the
B	really big
A	microwave
B	oh
A	and
B	mm
A	I tell you when I have bacon
B	mm
A	I can just sit there and eat
B	eat it as well
A	fucking lovely
B	try that too then?
A	if you slice them
B	yeah yeah I did wonder
A	yeah
B	no wonder you er get through your George Foremans though
A	oh yeah I use them about three four times a day
B	using them that much
A	I mean I dunno how much longer this one's gonna last
B	no it doesn't damage you it doesn't
A	no
B	no
A	what was it I had three pound seventy-five
B	do you wanna cup of tea mum?
unknown_female	mm
B	three pound seventy-five
A	no
B	mm
A	when I left this evening I had a three pound
B	oh right
B	that's not bad
A	and I could
A	that's about it
B	yeah
A	and
B	and yeah does he does he shower down there as well
B	so how long does your gas last
A	fucking don't last a week
B	no
B	yeah
B	do you have like a
A	oh yeah
B	I don't know
A	you must have an electric key then?
B	and then
A	no you must have electric key
B	but that's good and
A	you just
B	yeah
A	you slide it in the thing
B	pop it yeah
A	yeah
B	that's a really nice way to control your bills isn't it?
A	I mean
B	oh so it minuses it off the?
A	yeah and
B	oh can it go into the minuses the meter then?
A	if someone's got a debt on there already you wanna
B	yeah
A	make sure that
B	that it's paid by the company
A	well yeah say look
B	how do you get the debt on it though? cos it's does the electricity just cut off when you've run out of money?
A	cos the
B	ah
A	same as the gas the gas is the worst one
B	just goes into emergency?
A	yeah and then if you leave it it just build up and build up
B	ah
A	well if you leave that for like six months
B	yeah
A	then to get out the emergency you're gonna need about fucking two hundred quid
B	yeah
A	then you've got your own gas on
A	well ring me up when you get down there
B	yeah it is only electricity so
A	oh I I tell you what
B	I don't wanna waste money like in the winter we're not gonna put the heating on or
A	if I could just have electric I would
B	run a bath
A	I'm so fucked off with the gas
A	oh yeah I'd rather do that
B	mm
A	if I had an electric cooker
B	I mean even so it should be cheaper anyway
A	I'd be mugged up
B	we figured putting on an appliance like a George Foreman will cost less energy than heating up an entire cooker
A	yeah
B	even if they are both electric
A	it takes what five minutes to heat it up
B	yeah
A	you can literally cook anything on it
B	yeah
A	it don't matter what
B	as long as it doesn't have a sauce
A	yeah
B	so it
A	or like a packet of pasta
A	but you just boil a kettle
B	yeah cos I think
A	even if it says you can't microwave it you can
B	I think I'm pretty sure
A	no you can't do beans
B	you can't
A	unless you get
B	you've never even tried
A	the only other way you do it is you get two bits of bread
B	ah yeah like sandwich them together?
A	put the beans in the middle whack the bread together just
B	make it
A	and then yeah you'd have like toast
B	but it's still
A	yeah you can do it like that you can do toasted sandwiches in it
B	oh you could do some well good toasties on it like
A	yeah
B	let me finish this
A	I mean
B	oh yeah
A	I had some
B	nice and thick?
A	I'd fry the old George up
B	mm
A	he loved it
B	and he burns more energy with you but I think he eats more food with you too
A	oh yeah I mean we do do a lot of exercise
B	mm
A	god knows how many miles we rode this
A	she can't even walk upstairs
B	thyroid
B	like
A	she can't
A	no she
B	oh yeah must be something er
A	yeah mental
A	thyroid
B	mum doesn't talk to her any more anyway
A	no mum don't want anything to do with her I don't blame her either
A	she's a
B	yeah
A	and he knows now
A	yeah
A	one more year he's at secondary school
B	makes me feel old
A	mm
B	cos I'm the youngest

A	I I used to be able to beat anyone at skimming stones
B	oh
