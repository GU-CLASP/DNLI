B	yeah
A	mm
B	I
C	and
A	yeah they're very different companies
B	but completely different tasks
A	yeah
C	yeah there are the sort of channels where
A	they're not different categories
C	no similar tasks but the
A	so I make big big er like entertainment shows
B	so like what?
A	like erm well we made we made the really big flop Stars in Their Eyes
C	Stars in Their Eyes Big Brother
A	Big Brother we make
C	erm
A	and we've got a new show on called Big Box Little Box
C	big game show
A	which is like Gogglebox but for er
C	for gadgets
A	for gadgets for like viewing like the Witch thing but non
C	Total Wipeout
B	I love Total Wipeout
A	yeah everyone thinks everyone loves Total Wipeout
B	but then
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	but if it was on like if you're flicking through the channels
A	but if it's on you'd watch it
B	yeah
A	but then it's on Challenge or wherever isn't it? yeah anyway there might who knows they might bring it back
C	on BBC
A	but erm
B	what you don't work on anything
A	he does comedy
C	I do more sitcoms
B	is that cos you're really funny?
A	you are
C	so we've made so we've made Mr Bean erm
B	oh yeah really funny
C	The Vicar of Dibley
C	erm
A	er Bad Education
C	I don't know if you've seen that?
B	no
C	it's a Jack Whitehall show
B	I've I've like seen it advertised
C	yeah
B	but never actually watched it
C	Catherine Tate Show
B	oh okay
A	mm
C	so we do Benidorm stuff like that
A	a bit more indie like
C	it's a little more niche
B	but is it like do you did you particularly go into that area of telly or have you kind of ended up in those areas?
C	no
A	no
B	cos I thought you wanted comedy
A	yeah no I was
C	mm
A	we first met
C	I hadn't really watched any stand up comedy until
A	and I used to go every single night
A	cos do you remember
B	yeah well I still know him
A	do you still talk to him?
B	yeah like not like not every day
A	no
B	but he in House of Fools I don't think he's funny at all
A	he's
C	I don't I've oh I've seen him a few times now and I don't particularly find that funny
B	I
A	weirdly cos I really liked him I've seen him a few like but I've never seen a full hour of him
B	yeah
A	I've just seen him in stand up slots where he's done like ten minutes and I've quite liked him and I thought he's got
B	but he's like that in real life
A	the kind of warmness that I quite like but sort of stiffness and warmness
B	he's quite awkward
C	but we talked
A	yeah
C	I talked about this before and I was like
A	yeah we talked about him cos I quite liked him and he's this
C	after seeing him I wondered if you cos a lot of the audience around me were laughing about the way he pronounced stuff or whatever and I was like if you take away his accent if he was an English guy doing the same accent
A	mm
C	would you laugh in a I don't know if he would be popular at all
A	no no no but but then like but then my point was like if you
C	sure yeah deliver a massive
A	no no but
B	do you know who he learnt his English off?
C	no
A	you
B	Ali G no not me
C	did he?
B	that's who he like yeah and like half his
C	that's funny
A	that's funny
B	half his family's Chilean and half his family's Norwegian
C	wow
A	oh
C	yeah I know I know but ah yeah I to be fair I saw him at a when I saw him
A	and it's funny as a comedian learning the language
C	when I saw him
B	he's incredible the to think that you can do that in another language like
C	yeah
B	and he's so funny like cos
C	and like the year he won the award like
B	yeah
C	did he win newcomer?
A	he won newcomer yeah he won everything
A	he was nominated was he?
B	hm?
A	no he won it he won it
C	I think he won best newcomer
A	did he win best newcomer?
B	I think at Edinburgh
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah he did yeah
B	mm but honestly like cos there's erm cos
C	who
B	my friend
A	mm
B	but erm
A	oh he's definitely made it here like everyone knows his name
B	but
A	mm
B	like
A	yeah
B	but it's really interesting because you can be really funny in real life and just that does not translate to
C	no
B	you know comedy
A	but that's not I don't think that does oh like the amount of comedians they're so self-centred and so kind of infatuated with themselves
B	yeah
A	that you
B	yeah
A	and you can tell it so badly and it's suddenly just like ah this is tragic rather than actually being funny or
B	yeah
A	but then living your whole life thinking well is this funny? is is what I'm saying funny? it's like I don't know I
B	but do you not also think that like in real life they're so much funnier than on telly? cos at Christmas mum bought us tickets to see Omid Djalili
A	oh yeah
B	and I've never liked him I've always just thought he was a complete idiot
A	mm
B	and we went to see him and
A	mm
B	I've never cried laughing so much
A	yeah
B	at a comedian
A	yeah
B	like when you're in the presence of some like
A	definitely
B	makes such a massive difference in just
C	the live the live experience makes a massive difference
A	definitely well cos
B	yeah yeah
C	do you mean Russell Kane?
A	no no Rushell Russell Howard because Russell Kane I think's amazing
B	yeah he's good anyway
C	mm
A	but terrible on TV but amazing yeah
C	mm
A	no I think I think it's massively in the room and and also I think there's a lot of people that can't put that warmth across
B	yeah
A	the TV rather than
C	I saw as well the last time to be fair on
B	yeah and then he wasn't funny at all because my friend
C	yeah so on the other half
A	yeah
C	of the shows he was apparently challenging himself to see if he could do improv
A	right
C	where basically he was going in with no material
A	god
C	and seeing if he could last an hour without any material and I must have seen him on one
A	see
C	of those nights and it was one of the worst shows I've ever seen
A	but
C	mm
A	and yet I don't like that's what he hasn't got so or you need that like flair where you're just
C	also I don't think you
B	probably
C	I think the audience probably need to know
A	yeah yeah they do yeah
B	and they
C	and I was really annoyed because I was like he'd won newcomer the year before and people will be buying tickets spending money on him
A	mm
C	because of that and thinking oh I'm gonna see a really polished comedian and instead half of the festival he was technically ripping people off
B	but I think that's him it's kind of like
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	cos he is just a bit like that and he is just
A	that's
B	I remember when I met him
A	yeah
B	we were at the we were at this like house party in Norway and I was like
B	who's that weirdo?
B	honestly it was it was
A	really?
B	he was so funny
C	mm
B	between the three of them
A	and also yeah
A	there is a certain like but you've gotta have balls to do that you know like the Man on the Moon? he's that I can't
C	oh yeah
A	do have you seen Andy Kaufman? he was this amazing comedian and he used to just come onstage and he'd do like he'd just do chicken noises for like half an hour and walk off or something or he'd say nothing and he was so controversial and yet now he's like revered you know like everyone think's he's amazing
C	he's idolised
A	and yet you can imagine people coming away from that going they've just wasted my
B	but but also like cos when the whole point of stand up is that it's supposed to be completely natural so therefore like you're supposed to come across as kind of
A	but
B	I know it's not
A	yeah
B	but it's supposed to come across as something that's like completely spontaneous and that's why it's so funny
A	yeah
B	so I can totally see why someone would want to kind of recreate that
A	yeah but weirdly it's that kind of thing isn't it? it's that I've been to so many er there's this one night in London called
B	yeah
A	or they know how to build so and like I've seen people just completely flounder and not like just bomb and yet they're funny if you watch
B	yeah
A	they construct their jokes well and they can learn to deliver them well
B	yeah
A	or people that have just done it a long time they know how to do it
B	it's really rare
A	but you're right it's stripping it back to what it should be
B	but it's it's really rare it's really rare to like I don't know it's really rare to find someone that probably could be that naturally funny
A	there is someone there is someone but then he's done it for years
B	we should go next time he's on we'll
A	no you should go next time he's on basically he's got
B	just buy tickets and we'll go
A	so you've got this mailing list it's thousands of
C	twenty-seven thousand
A	twenty-seven thousand people he's not been on TV since he was on Phoenix Nights you would love him he's completely
C	he doesn't really do gigs bigger than like eighty people or whatever
A	he does tiny gigs he no occasionally
B	that's just brilliant though
A	he does them at the National Theatre
C	he does big yeah he does those big
A	and he charges twelve quid to go in like you can go to the National Theatre
B	okay let's let's try and get tickets and just go
A	so I'll
B	yeah
A	I tell you
B	mm mm
A	erm and if you can't come that's fine but like
B	that's really
A	it's er yeah it his shows are phenomenal and he can I've been to see so many er like early on material gigs and they they're always good cos he can just talk and he when he talks it's funny but I don't know hardly anyone that can do that and he's been doing it for years
C	it's rare to find someone who can do both because you get really good MCs people who can do those nights where they just introduce somebody else and they're on to do filler like Jarred Christmas is really good at MCing and talking to people he's actually a really funny comic like just doing the bits in between but if you probably pay to see a full polished hour from him you probably come away thinking oh
A	yeah
C	it's it's there's some shortcomings in it
A	mm
B	but do you so you know you do these comedy programmes but do you actually meet all the people in them or do never kind of go on set? or
C	I normally do
A	he's on set a lot yeah
B	really?
C	I normally meet them all
A	he's just produced this
B	yeah in Benidorm
A	a series called Drunk History
B	I
C	oh yeah
A	ah yeah
B	yeah it was really good I liked it
C	we were annoyed by the trailers but yeah it had some good people in it I'm quite shy on set I don't really talk to people on set
B	are they actually drunk?
C	yeah so they drink
A	yeah they're really pissed like completely off their head
C	and we drink with them to make them feel comfortable and stuff
B	that's such a crazy idea isn't it?
C	yeah and then
B	and what channel are they on?
C	so it's Comedy Central
A	see no one really watches it cos like no one has
A	Comedy Central
B	but what a shame
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	it is but they er annoyingly it's not one of those programmes where it's our idea and Comedy Central have bought it it's actually the other way round Comedy Central it was an American show that Comedy Central acquired the rights to
A	Seth Rogen do you know Seth Rogen? he's like er
B	I've heard the name
B	is he isn't he
C	Will Ferrell
A	Will Ferrell
C	you know Will Ferrell?
B	where's Seth Rogen from?
A	Seth Rogen is the
C	he was in Knocked Up and
A	that's right he's the one with the slightly curly hair
C	he was one of the
B	ah yeah that's weird
C	he basically his little company made it in America for online for the internet and then
B	and then they kind of like
C	and then they turned it into a big show in America and then Comedy Central UK bought the rights to it and then asked
B	ah
C	and then asked various production companies who'd like to make it and we bid for it on it so
A	hello
B	are you gonna come here?
A	come here
B	she's quite a rude cat
C	the house
A	how dare she
B	yeah that it thanks for interrupting our conversation Coco
C	mm
A	mm
B	yeah that's mm
C	it's fun
B	be weird to having a drink at work
A	I had a gin and tonic today
B	did you?
A	at four o'clock
C	I had a beer at five
B	mm
A	actually it was five o'clock
C	for the last hour
A	five o'clock we
C	yeah
B	I thought they were putting it on
C	no they're all genuinely
A	no
C	what all the
A	did they do you know that
B	how can promote that? because surely it's promoting a culture that's
C	well that's what I don't
B	because I can't imagine it's a good image for like a show or
C	but yeah but it's not the the thing it's treated it's handled with care and you know everyone
A	yeah
C	everyone has a medical beforehand erm we have a medic on site that breathalyses them and if they hit a certain point they have to stop drinking and stuff and we also the wording our voice over says so and so drunk blah blah blah blah blah and you see them nursing a drink it's not really the show where I dunno but then then again we've had people that
A	I guess weirdly
C	could finish their story because they were too drunk and we showed them being sick in a bucket
A	but weirdly like I think
C	falling down stairs and stuff
A	I think Geordie Shore though where they're like getting so drunk they don't know what's going on and then they shag someone and then they
B	I've never see it
A	er no I've never seen it
B	yeah
A	I've never watched a full episode but all that where they're doing stuff they're off their face and they've no idea they're quite vulnerable
C	and the key and the key with both shows
A	it's way worse than
C	key with both shows is you never see us people behind this camera giving them the drink it always seems like it's and it's like we capture them at home having a glass of wine
A	yeah
C	while they tell this story Geordie Shore there's booze all in the house and it always appears to be they're just
A	but weirdly
A	no but we
B	but that's kind of worse is it not?
A	no it's way worse like legally though because er Big Brother like I worked in
C	well I'm
A	cos you're not allowed to you're not allowed to give them
C	yeah but that's not
A	that much alcohol legally on Big Brother that's why you have to
B	surely Big Brother was like the first show where kind of that happened on telly?
C	probably
A	yeah yeah I think you're right yeah
B	social experiment and
A	yeah
C	I think we spoke to someone we spoke to legal about it and it was like if you buy a drink and you put drink somewhere and they then take the drink then
A	yeah fair enough
C	you would
A	no
C	and that's why it
A	well maybe the difference is Big Brother's like a self-contained world it they can't get anything in they can't get anything out
C	yeah
A	and so you're basically
B	yeah so it's a bit different
C	and even you can say
A	yeah it is
C	even it was like you can also offer you can say would you like a drink
A	mm
C	it's when you say have this beer have this shot
A	yeah
C	have this whatever it is is when we suddenly step onto slightly grey area
A	mm
C	which we didn't do here
A	you're right though really
B	I dunno I just feel it's a bit it's a bit like weird in a way that like a programme they're telling histories and they're really funny cos I kind of feel oh that's a really great idea but I didn't necessarily see the need for the people to be drinking it like it could have just been like a
A	mm
C	sure
B	but that was like almost an excuse
C	but I guess the funny the funny thing comes when you have
B	I haven't seen it so I really
C	yeah
B	I've seen the adverts though
C	yeah but I guess you know I know what you mean cos I think that it
A	you could definitely do it
C	they could make it really funny without needing to be drunk
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	but what's quite funny is when they make mistakes that's quite literally the and because the way it works is they create the dialogue for the people that act in
B	yeah
C	the erm like like the recreations and people in the recreations have to lip-sync to that dialogue so when they make slip ups and you see like someone who's quite you know popular in the comedy world like Rebecca Front or whoever it is someone who's held in quite high esteem looking like Queen Victoria and it looks like a real old period drama but then they're talking this way
B	they're making a mistake
C	in this slurred voice and all that that's what
A	mm
C	adds the extra layer to it that's slightly different I agree I don't think it necessarily
A	it's sort of capturing those stories when you've had too much to drink and you're telling this story you're telling it in a completely different way cos you're drunk
B	yeah
A	and there is something funny about that
C	mm
A	and yet and and actually the reality of it is that it started off as this kind of quite small thing where like people get drunk tell stories and things
C	cult following
A	and it had a cult following and yet if you came to a channel and said we've got this idea
B	mm
A	history unless you had a massive comedian that wanted to that was their project there's no no way it would ever get a
B	yeah
C	mm
B	but the whole comedy world and
A	yeah but I don't feel like I've ended up anywhere
B	no?
A	I feel like I'm in in a place at the moment
B	we haven't finished
A	I haven't finished
B	with telly?
A	with telly or if I have gone a completely different way
B	what do you reckon you're gonna
A	it's no but it's always changing it's always changing I don't think I've found my thing yet
B	yeah
A	you know
B	no who well who does?
A	no
B	yeah
A	but I think some people I think
B	she's happy in her job now than she was at Easter or
A	I don't know she's stressed by it a lot I think she feels happier with it cos she feels like you know whenever you feel like you're kind of into something
B	yeah
A	erm you kind of enjoy it a bit more
B	yeah and also not having the travelling and
A	yeah
B	it must make it easier working
A	yeah yeah I think that makes a massive difference
C	that makes a big difference
A	and like
C	no she just wanted a
A	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah oh god no she wouldn't have finished
C	cos it takes like an hour and a half two hours just to get back
A	although she did used to work from home
C	but Friday is different yeah
A	she didn't even like working from home though she'd rather be in an office with people
B	well obviously
A	yeah
B	you know fine maybe one day a week once a month or something
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	mm
B	she looks amazing so looks so happy
A	just whenever she's having a bad day she looks down she's like ah
B	you know they're just so happy aren't they?
A	yeah
B	I was so happy when I heard that they got engaged
A	I know amazingly sweet engagement
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so are you gonna stay in
A	no I don't really like
B	really?
C	she doesn't
A	no I don't
A	no yeah
A	I know but we just can't
C	I think
A	yeah
B	but what about
C	I think
A	we can't live in
B	no I
C	I don't know if I could deal with three and a half hours like three hours on the train a day
A	I couldn't
B	no I
C	as much as I like in terms of the surrounding I probably prefer to live round here but
A	I would definitely but it's just not
C	it's just it's just not
B	where where do you work in
A	in
C	west
B	so that is like miles from
A	erm
C	it's half an hour tube but
B	yeah but it's it's forty-five minutes
C	it's probably like ten minutes to change ten minutes change over and then you've got half an hour in
B	mm yeah so how so
A	er
C	so that's like ten minutes into
A	it's sort of no
B	and that's where you used to live? are you thinking of moving there quite soon? or
A	no
C	we're saving now
A	basically we're saving now
C	so what what I do is we're gonna go to Australia for Christmas
B	that's so exciting
A	I know
B	whereabouts? to see
C	we'll go Tazzy again
A	yeah yeah we're gonna go and see
B	ah that'll be amazing
C	yeah
A	I know and er
B	is she good?
A	she's really good so she had this er
B	whatever yeah
A	and er then like went through a bit of a tough time but I think she's really good now she's moved back down to
B	ah in her flat? the same one or
A	er yeah in that did you see her in her flat?
B	yeah cos I went to stay in her flat
A	course you did
B	for like one or two nights yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	so she moved out of there?
A	she moved out of there and I think rented it out and moved up to
B	oh really?
A	yeah yeah and lived in
B	wow
A	yeah
B	she's so clever
C	why did I think she was doing like paediatricianing?
A	yeah so
C	no
A	she's doing child
C	child psychiatry?
A	yeah for children for kids
C	I knew she was
B	start to
A	yeah no she's I mean god she's amazing
B	she's incredible
A	and she'll end up one of the world's
C	paediatrics
A	greatest
B	yeah
A	you know so so
B	so what are you gonna do in Australia? are you gonna travel a little bit?
A	well so we were going to go out for
B	Christmas?
A	yeah
B	that would be brilliant and you're really
C	Christmas and New Year
A	we're sort of planning
B	have you
A	we were planning six weeks but I think it's going to be three weeks but that's still a long time
B	that'll be brilliant
C	erm and then so the so the
B	cos someone was like oh
A	no no I mean I'll I'm
C	we talked about we had talked about
A	we still might who knows?
C	we talked about staying out there for
A	well we still might
C	yeah if we wanna give the cat to someone else
A	oh yeah that's the only thing is the cat
B	would
A	yeah she would yeah
B	so
C	I don't know if I'd be I yeah I don't know if I'd be necessarily keen on going to spend like six months out there right now I don't know why
B	yeah see how you feel
A	how about you?
A	how's your holiday situation?
B	I dunno because
C	oh I thought you meant like how about you? why don't you come with me instead?
C	me and the cat yeah
