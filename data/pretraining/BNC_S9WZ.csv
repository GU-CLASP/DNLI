A	so I wanted to know what's happening next door did it not get sold at the auction?
B	no
A	cos I see there's a big auction sign back up
B	yeah so it didn't go the best the guide price was one sixty-seven
A	yes which you said was way too much didn't you?
B	ridiculous
A	bit of land that size?
B	so somebody had obviously made an offer that was the last bid price which
A	oh oh
B	they didn't accept erm
A	oh well you er
B	I think it was guide price one six seven
A	oh right
B	so er so but that was I suppose it's a guide price isn't it? but they've put it up haven't they for two hundred thousand
A	oh god
B	which is ridiculous I mean for christ's sake
A	did anybody bid do you know? did you go? cos you were talking about going
B	well there there was a price of one seven on the on the information if you go online
A	yeah
B	and look I think there's a price of one seventy-seven
A	right
B	so erm obviously they didn't accept that so it's at that was over at
A	well yeah
B	to
A	it was December wasn't it?
B	don't know
A	cos I remember you said you were thinking of
B	yeah yeah we were thinking of
A	going along yeah
B	this one as at Derby
A	oh when's the next one then?
B	twenty-third of February I think
A	I wonder how long they'll like hang on before they accept a
B	well I don't know I don't know
A	gosh
B	because they've only got twelve months left of the planning permission
A	right so somebody's got to
B	because it expires
A	buy it and build it and get sorted and
B	and er yeah within that twelve months otherwise they've got to start again I mean if you if you were buying it for the plot and the location and all the rest of it to be honest I don't think the fact that plans were about to expire would
A	no
B	overly concern me because it's highly unlikely they're gonna say no next time round when permission has been given
A	mm mm
B	so that wouldn't concern me too much erm but it is obviously something that
A	you wouldn't just buy that
B	just
A	you wouldn't just buy that without intending to buy would
B	oh no no you'd only buy it with the intent to build but it wouldn't be too much if
A	no
B	the existing plans
A	no no no
B	had expired
A	but it's still a lot isn't it? cos even when you've built your house on that
B	I know
A	I mean it's such a small plot you're not gonna get a massive amount of money you're not gonna get the return I wouldn't have thought
B	no
A	and I don't know how much it costs
B	no
A	to build a house but
B	I think you're talking fifty fifty-sixty thousand pounds to build a house
A	to build it but then you've got to kit it out
B	yeah
A	I mean that you'll
B	well yeah
A	you'll double that again won't you by the time
B	yeah
A	you've put in your kitchen and your bathroom or your furniture so I just don't see how
B	and there's a lot of
A	they're gonna get the
B	no
A	return on it
B	there's a lot of work involved because they've got to lower the land haven't they?
A	lower it yes yeah all those conditions well got to
B	lower the land
A	oh so the next one's February
B	yeah
A	wait and see then
B	I think it's the twenty-third of Feb so we'll have to see go online just after and see if it's sold
A	mm
B	or whatever
A	oh is that what you did last time?
B	yeah if yeah
A	oh okay
B	just go on and it it it gives you information of all the plots that are available or were available and
A	oh right
B	and you know so you can
A	and what they went for?
B	go on and have a look yeah
A	oh okay
B	yeah yeah
A	oh
B	yeah I know and
A	yeah
B	I phoned her up the other day and erm I said to her erm I texted to say I'll phone you tomorrow blah so I phoned she phoned me up half an hour before I was going to phone her and said er oh I'm only phoning you to tell you I've come home but I've gotta go straight back out I won't be here at half two erm I'll catch are you in tonight?

B	go yeah yeah yeah no problem she said and er I said no actually oh no said yeah no problem but I'm going out
A	oh gosh
B	make it tonight
A	who'd have thought it was that difficult to arrange a phone conversation?
B	I know she said make it tonight and I said we're doing Avon tonight I said
A	oh my goodness
B	so erm it'll have to be tomorrow so I puts the phone I down I thought gonna have to phone her now and I cos it's not gonna happen so I phoned her back and I said right okay I've clocked off let's talk now and I'll return to that
A	mm
B	afterwards I said so what have you got to tell me then? she went I'm having a baby
B	and I went
A	no way
B	what? and she went I'm having a baby and I went but well ah you're fostering

A	a
B	no
A	child no?
B	I said that grandchild I said
A	oh okay
B	she said no no no she said I'm playing you up and er I said to her er well what's this you've got to tell me then? she said well I've been avoiding talking to you she said because I wouldn't be able to talk to you and not tell you I went go on then tell me she said I'm moving to
B	yeah I went why?
A	from
B	yeah I said why? I said has
A	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	she said erm what it is is
A	how old is he?
A	late
B	a year or two
A	late fifties or
B	older than
A	er sort of forties fifty oh
B	no yeah year or two older than me
A	gosh
B	a year older maybe I dunno one or two erm so he's requested voluntary redundancy and they've said no you know they
A	oh
B	he's too important to lose type of thing but erm whilst he'd put in for this request he's been putting the feelers out and he's been offered a job working at the company in
A	mm
B	it's a family business the guy who one of the family members works there but the guy who is kind of like manager of the of the depot branch wherever it is company used to work with
A	right
B	so this guy approached
A	mm
B	go just a couple of days a week and be like the chief exec so I'm kind of overseeing it all but I'm only coming in one or two days a week so I need someone to run the company and you're my man I want you
A	yeah
B	erm they're happy to wait you know however long it takes if it's six eight twelve months they'll assist him with the move although they haven't actually said financially
A	oh okay
B	it may just be impatience you know
A	yes yeah yeah
B	well however long it takes blah I don't know
A	yeah
B	erm so the only thing is is
A	is
B	no she's finished uni erm she hasn't got herself a proper job yet but she's doing a sports massage course now
A	oh okay
B	and
A	and has she got a boyfriend?
B	no she hasn't had a boyfriend
A	right but
B	but
A	yeah I can understand why they wouldn't want to
B	yeah they used to go they used to go to school together and I think it was when
A	yeah
B	they you know they managed to meet up
A	got back in touch yeah
B	got in touch all that sort of thing and they've been together ever since so and
A	the
B	I keep inviting her mum to tea cos I feel awful
B	cos she's here all the time and since they've finished university cos she used to just on the holiday she'd spend all her time with
A	yeah yeah
B	and hardly see her mum and like you know
A	ah
B	now that they've actually finished she's she's doing the same again she's I said so has she as good as moved in
A	oh
B	and I mean oh god how much her mum feel? she must
A	is her mum on her own?
B	still I still keep inviting her for tea erm no got she's got a son who lives at home
A	oh okay
B	but she's divorced
A	right oh gosh
A	mm
B	they're close you know and they meet for coffee and that sort of thing
A	yeah yeah but
B	but she's kind of living
A	not the same so oh so they they're gonna stay
B	so
A	so where will they live?
A	mm
B	because with the money they can pay off the uni debts and not the kids' uni debts the uni debts
A	have they still got those?
B	through supporting them
A	oh
B	I mean they've been running
A	mm
B	putting petrol in it all the time three hundred and fifty pound a month no three hundred pound a month to
A	yeah it's a lot
B	extra year for
A	mm
B	like you know debt so they wanna pay that off and they want to give a deposit for
A	mm
B	but
A	right
B	now I don't know but I just think
A	I'd give them separate amounts to use as a
B	yeah
A	deposit towards their own houses
B	yeah
A	cos otherwise that's just gonna get messy down the line isn't it?
B	it's gonna get messy isn't it? cos she said if they decide to go their separate ways then they can sort it then cos I said so what's gonna happen? is is it like that you'll give them the deposit but then
A	mm
B	but I'm thinking to myself gonna be awfully young to potentially have to be buying out like
A	the other one and
B	seventy thousand pounds or whatever
B	and there's
A	so they'd have to choose together which house they're going to buy
B	yeah
A	decide how they want to decorate it I mean that's a married couple thing that's not a brother and sister thing
B	exactly
A	and and the brother's girlfriend
B	no
A	I mean that's just not
B	I said to
A	things yeah
B	and all the rest of it?
A	the spare part
B	the spare part
A	mm
B	I said it's not gonna work
A	no and the next thing you know
B	it's not gonna work
A	she'll fall pregnant and it'll be a disaster
B	mm
A	no I wouldn't
B	no no no
A	do it that way either but erm
B	no no I need to speak to
A	no I mean absolutely give them both money that they can put towards a deposit
B	they would be better off they would be better off I'm gonna say to her you would be better off putting whatever money you're gonna give them to one side yeah but split it in half
A	mm
A	yeah yeah
B	in a position
A	to buy
B	to buy
A	to say
B	and then they've got five grand towards their deposit then
A	mm
B	but
A	cos you need a huge deposit these days don't you?
B	yes is it like fifteen grand?
A	oh I know
B	but then she said which I think is oh she said I think what we're gonna do to start with for the first couple of years so that at the end of each month they don't feel like depressed cos they've got no money we're gonna go on an interest only mortgage
A	oh no
B	I know
A	can you still get those?
A	I didn't think you
B	they'll be lucky if they get one now
A	I didn't think they were still I didn't think they were still an option because they caused so many problems didn't they? people couldn't
B	mm
A	get to the end and couldn't afford the
B	see
A	I don't know I've not looked into them but
B	when when they moved to the house they're in in Wales
A	mm
B	they went on an interest-only because it was a bit more than they could afford but erm
A	oh that's why
B	well yeah and I'm down the road
A	yes yeah
B	she's not been very well of late
A	oh has she?
B	of late cos I said well why
A	oh no
B	it's vile I said but closer to
A	mm
B	about and that I said but then I suppose you're kind of gonna be on your own
A	I suppose
B	oh yeah
A	it's only gonna be half an hour isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	forty minutes something like
B	yeah it's not hard
A	so it's not
B	no
A	that's not a bad journey
B	yeah
A	and if her sister's there like you're saying and you're only
B	sister's there
A	ten minutes this way
B	at least she's got a little bit of
A	yeah yeah
B	support not that she'll need support cos she got no kids any
A	well I know but then she won't know anyone will she so it's quite a bit thing still to move area and
B	it's still quite a big thing
A	cos without the kids there you don't there's your
B	you don't get to meet people
A	your link to to make to make friends isn't it?
B	and she can't be reliant on me and
A	no no
B	cos we've still got kids and are running here there and everywhere
A	yeah yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	we're at a different stage
A	yes yeah
B	of live aren't we? so she can't think oh I'll move there because
A	mm
B	I can see
A	no no
B	twice a week and that'll fill my week cos that's not gonna happen
A	will she get a job?
B	probably she'll
A	so that that'll help
B	look for a job
A	yes yeah
B	yeah she'll look for a job
A	oh okay
B	cos she's looking in Wales and she's just not having much luck just wanting a job
A	I imagine the job market's not great there though is it?
B	no ideally she wants something erm because of the operation on her hips on her hip
A	mm
B	erm she can't the the job she's come from was you know when you go into like Debenhams and stock up the jewellery or you know wherever and do
A	yeah yeah
B	do the jewellery top up and that was an awful lot of work on her knees
A	oh
B	coding and you know
A	mm
B	rehanging
A	oh that's no good
B	different things you know so that's absolutely no good for her she can't do that and it involved a lot of driving which if she sits for any major length of time she has terrible problems with her hip
A	mm
B	so erm she got a little bit of restriction really she can't sort of sit for too long she's better off
A	oh okay
B	being a little bit mobile
A	yes well
B	she's just looking for something part time
A	part time
B	really
A	they're the hard ones cos everyone wants that don't they?
B	yeah
A	have you heard how
B	no I haven't no
A	cos she was very pleased to get it wasn't she?
B	yeah
A	hers is part time but yeah
B	yeah
A	everybody wants the part time jobs don't they?
B	yeah
A	our age
B	our age
A	can't be doing full
B	oh
A	somebody asked me the other day would I ever go back to full-time work who was it? thought it was the boys when we were chatting I said god no
B	no
A	haven't done full-time work
B	how many hours would you say you do a week?
A	now?
B	yeah
A	erm
B	it's enough
A	it's enough because of all the other stuff the unpaid stuff the taxiing
B	yeah
A	toing and froing the cooking the shopping the cleaning I mean I do all of that
B	oh no he spends too much
A	too expensive when he goes erm
B	far too much
A	so yeah but it's enough it's enough
B	so where were you Friday night then?
A	Friday night?
B	where were you?
A	oh did you go to erm
B	oh is that where you where then?
A	I wasn't there where were you?
B	I was at
A	oh I wasn't invited
B	and as
A	obviously
A	oh
B	yes so where were you?
A	ordering a pizza

B	I said to
A	out together yeah no we went to the
B	oh
A	because
B	yes she invited
A	Neal's Yard party
B	yeah
A	and I said no I can't we're going to the
B	yeah
A	I said have you now?
B	yeah cos I
A	the minute we go out literally the minute we go out
B	oh really?
A	they don't
B	oh oh well it's planned
A	oh yes
B	it was planned cos as soon as they came in from school because
A	yes I know
A	I've seen those two since actually and she said you had a nice time
B	and he had invited
A	oh
A	yeah
B	and is said oh well we don't go out very often on our own
A	no
B	and they're not gonna know anybody you know what I mean so although I said it was really lovely of you to include them but no
A	yeah
A	don't want them to come no
B	erm and erm so the plan was
B	she'll be fine so they're laughing you know and erm and I'm sitting here I'm thinking oh haven't gotta cook tonight oh my god what shall I do with myself? you know when you think
A	yeah
B	yeah and I had a thought so I said next time they appeared I said mm I said I don't want
A	yeah
B	it would put
A	mm
B	and then they realise oh
A	she's on her own
B	young girl and
A	yeah
B	I said you know I'm not even I'm not even gonna put her in that position
A	yeah yeah
B	so said right I'm not so
A	oh they'd discussed it
B	discussed this
A	oh okay
B	so I said either you order your pizza to be sure it's here before
A	mm
B	or the pizza gets ordered with the boys and
A	oh
B	and it'll be this
B	and they're going no way
A	yeah yeah
B	blah so
A	that's
B	that's the pizza
A	the pizza
B	so we went to the bottom of the drive and looked he said no somebody's parked up so as we were passing saw this cap and it was a girl she was doing this I said are you delivering a pizza? she went yeah I went oh it's just there and I said to
A	yes yeah
B	and then
A	girl out I know
B	on her own
A	well
B	you never know
A	she must want that job yeah
B	he said I suppose they think of
A	yeah but she could be
B	you know
A	she could get anything on her round
B	yeah
A	you don't know do you?
B	so erm so yeah that was sorted
A	oh well they didn't
B	oh yeah yeah
A	on that pizza counter?
B	yeah
A	so I'd got them one of those for the boys to share so and and actually I'd bought it with the shopping last week so it had been in the freezer so I'd got it out that morning and I'd said to him you can have this tonight because we're we're going out
B	mm
A	and er so that was that so they
B	yeah
A	and
B	huge
A	are huge so they hadn't actually managed to eat all of that said they ordered a they ordered a pizza and they and
A	I said well why didn't they take it with them it's theirs? no they didn't want it but of course
A	he loves cold pizza for breakfast sadly
B	oh
A	so
A	cos
B	sorted
A	cos they had their lunch there as well
A	and then then the pizza was gone
B	oh
A	but no they didn't tell they didn't even tell me that they were coming round but so obviously they had it planned that they were going to be ordering pizza but
B	yeah
B	never said
A	but he knew from the morning that I'd got this pizza that
A	out of the freezer so it had to be cooked
B	well

B	he didn't want
A	didn't want the
B	doesn't want the
A	she's producing that much I know and he spat it out I said oh no
A	not having that now too watery don't want that
B	oh I know it's like
A	I was laughing
A	but they've got this they've got this fancy bottle making thing
B	mm
A	has she told you about it?
B	she did tell me
A	yeah
B	I said my how technology moves on
A	I know cos they're not allowed to make them up in the morning and keep them for twenty-four hours that's not allowed any more
B	well I said to
A	it's ridiculous
B	I breastfed both of mine for a year I said and in the company of friends I used to see them with the bottles washing them out and putting the and I used to think to myself how time consuming all I do is unclip
A	yeah
B	get my boob out sorted
A	out and there you go
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah
B	and I used to watch you know bottles
A	yeah
B	and scoops and shake and
A	yeah
B	and I used to think oh my god what a faff
A	well I bottle fed mine but you just get used to it don't you? it's what you know
B	yes
A	I can't remember why she said actually
B	mm
A	apparently he's spitting it out now
B	spitting it out now
A	the breast milk
B	I can't say I blame him it's like it is like water
A	it's watery yeah
B	very watery
A	so anyway he was very happy though
B	bless him so will she stop now do you think?
A	I don't know
B	she
A	cos I didn't actually see
B	no oh
A	I know it's nice isn't it? when I had mine I didn't have anyone to babysit cos we didn't live
B	no
A	we never did that yeah we never had that luxury
B	I I never did
A	cos if they came to see us
B	even though
A	they were coming to see us
B	yeah I never did even though cos like mum was sort of starting to get poorly
A	yes yeah
B	erm
B	oh god no
A	I see I saw
B	I think she only works two days a week
A	oh does she?
B	I'm not sure what hours she does but I think she does two days and then sometimes she'll do some private physio on a Monday or I think that
A	oh is she a physio?
B	well she's not a qualified physio she's just one of them assistants you know
A	oh
B	like an
A	oh okay
B	she's not
A	I didn't really know what she did
B	she's done no exams or qualified
A	oh right
B	but she works at
A	oh okay
B	so like you know if erm simple basic exercises you know
A	right
B	to get people back home or they've
A	oh
B	had an injury
A	oh okay
B	just that sort of thing she does
A	I didn't know anyway she always seems to be in the gym
B	yeah yeah she goes out most nights I think to there
A	yeah
B	and I think do you never spend any time with your family?
A	I think sometimes she goes twice a day
B	yeah I wouldn't be surprised
A	because I went to a class yesterday morning that I haven't been to for quite a long time and sometimes I go on a Monday night and I
B	yeah
A	for me it was either or er
B	yeah
A	but I thought it wouldn't surprise me actually if she goes back
B	no and when erm when
A	oh have they?
B	their sort of drive situation
A	oh
B	so
A	oh what so that she can go in and out?
B	cos he said oh most nights
A	cos he's a member there but he doesn't seem to go half as often does he?
B	I don't think he goes as much as
A	no mm no
B	anyway she is
A	is is
B	obsessed by it
A	yeah yeah very much so
B	you know
A	very much so but anyway I mean it pays off she's got an amazing figure
B	yeah but
A	but yeah it's a lot of hours
B	she don't eat
A	oh doesn't she?
B	she hardly eats no even the girls are turning out the same now picky you know
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	oh that's not good is it?
B	oh no she don't she hardly eats
A	oh well that makes sense then
B	yeah no I've never seen her tuck into a good meal
A	oh
B	never no no never
A	oh gosh
B	it's you know bitty like a little bit of this and a little bit of that and
A	oh god
B	no
A	drive me mad that would
B	oh god no god no no it's not no no
A	we had
B	what's she like?
A	well she's nice
B	is she nice?
B	a lot more about her
B	oh
A	er no she was
B	oh really?
A	well she like she knew his
B	what just looking at him or
A	well just I don't know she she knew his timetable better than he did which I thought was a bit
B	are they in
A	no
B	the same classes? no?
A	only for science only for science like she was saying you know the following day she said well I've got this and you've got that and I cos he you know
A	are we on week A or week B? I say I don't know
A	but you know he's a bit like that but she said no you've got this
B	it's cos she's meeting him when he comes out isn't it?
A	I think it must be and erm I'd had a I can't even remember what it was we'd had a text from the school about something that was going on
B	oh bless
A	I said to him have you planned ahead
A	it's as far as we've got mm
A	cos you won't be here have you told her?
B	oh
A	have you told her you're going away?
A	but yeah
B	so what why did the other relationship finish?
A	I don't know he never really said
B	and did this one
A	I mean it was
B	well yeah
A	word on the bus was
B	oh I was gonna say yeah
A	I don't know he never said
B	the word wasn't it that
A	he just said to me no we didn't see each other mum he doesn't see much of any cos he's so busy
B	he likes the girls then does he our
A	he seems to and
B	I think that's the way they are now
A	yeah
B	to be fair I think
A	all
B	opposite opposite erm gender
A	mm
B	you know is the norm now isn't it as friends whereas in our day if you spoke to a boy it was like is that your boyfriend?
A	what was it he said to me this morning?
B	whereas I think the opposite sex now
A	I tell you what changing times what was it he said to me this morning?
A	I said no you didn't mention it I thought
A	you know what
B	yeah
A	they hear about and talk about all the time
B	yeah yeah
A	isn't it?
B	and it's yeah
A	and he's going did I not tell you mum?
B	yeah
A	I'm a
A	I'm a which way
B	girl
A	I'm a girl trapped in a boy's
B	trapped a boy's
A	body I said oh I said well now we'll see how that turns out then
A	and off he went with his hair sticking out everywhere
B	oh bless him
A	but yeah you just can't
B	it's it's like erm
A	dealing with all the time isn't it?
B	it in our days at school you know if somebody wore glasses or braces you you know it you know there would have been that mimicking and taking the mickey
A	yeah yeah
B	wouldn't there? but no now they go for like coloured
A	oh yeah no no that's right no no that's just that's perfectly okay but
B	very different
A	but you know
B	isn't it?
A	that I think they're sort of taught that aren't they? it's okay
B	yeah
A	to be whoever you are
B	yeah
A	which is a good thing I'm not saying it's a bad thing at all it's just that it just you know just sounded weird coming from him
B	yeah
A	off he goes and kicks his football but you know they
A	they obviously have to talk about all this stuff don't they?
B	they do because it self-harming is really quite
A	oh popular for want
B	yeah
A	of a better word
B	yeah
A	but it's
A	what is the word?
B	yeah
A	prevalent I don't know
A	not popular but
B	scary
A	I know
B	it's scary
A	yeah
B	I mean you know in our day if you'd have been seen to be self-harming you'd have had an appointment with the psyche wouldn't you?
A	well you were
B	you'd be going to see the you know
A	well you would
B	the psychopathic nurse because
A	well when I
B	they'd think you were
B	you did
A	we had a
B	yeah
A	she was there all day every day and you went to the if you weren't well
B	yeah you went to the school nurse
A	you want to the nurse's room she had a little like
B	mm
A	but we did we had a school nurse but yeah
B	just trying to think whether we did at
A	were you not as posh as
B	I don't think we had a nurse there
B	all day every day
A	well she always I mean I didn't go but like if somebody was ill
B	yeah
A	they were sent there so assumed she was there
B	I tell you what they had at
A	sixth former
B	lower sixth
A	yeah
B	yeah former yeah oh it's not for me move on so I went to college and they had erm like a counsellor
A	mm
B	had like a lady that was a she was lovely she did one of our lectures I think as I remember but anyway she used to have her own little office and when she wasn't lecturing erm she was sort of an open door if anybody had got any problems
A	okay
B	or issues
A	mm
B	and I suppose you are of an age there aren't you where oh well I don't know were drugs as
A	mm yeah
B	big?
A	yeah
B	you know where the I don't know erm for whatever reason but I always remember she was a lovely lovely lady she was but she was permanently onsite and
A	mm
B	and she had this little office
A	had a little
B	at the end of the corridor
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she was lovely
A	but anyway I don't actually think
B	no not
A	I've never seen more of a boy
B	no no if he was bringing a lot of male friends home then you know you'd have reason to be concerned but no I don't think you're gonna have any worries there
A	I dunno
B	oh bless them bless them
A	yeah
B	how they're gonna turn out what jobs they're gonna be doing you know
A	oh goodness knows have you did I ask you about
B	no
A	because you know they have to do it don't they in
B	yes cos
A	what does he
B	see the problem is
A	what he wants to know so it's hard to know isn't it?
B	so I think we've just got to look upon this work experience of just putting them in a working day
A	cos I did work experience and I had a boring week well because you're sixteen and they don't give you anything to do do they?
B	no no
A	you just sit there
B	yeah but I think just exposing them to er strange people people they don't know
A	yeah I suppose so
B	all that
A	and being able to get on with it yeah
B	even yeah
A	I suppose so
B	is part of it
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	I think
B	yeah
A	for a week
B	that's a good idea
A	and he has
A	yeah he has asked the manager of
B	put him in yeah
A	people each day
B	that's very
A	so he could do that
B	good idea I've said to
A	mm
B	erm
A	no
B	and he would just end up end sitting there all day
A	yeah yeah
B	doing nothing
A	it is hard to know isn't it?
B	you know when you think who
A	well we were trying to think of we were
B	yeah
A	all of our friends and their occupations and some were do you fancy this do you fancy that? but no no well what does that involve?
B	yeah
A	doesn't really know what the involve so
B	no I said you could go and stop at auntie
A	no no
B	and that's what he needs
A	it's what
B	yeah
A	no you can't
B	cos I said to
A	no I don't know
B	he's actually he's older than sixteen so he's old enough to play
A	yeah so yeah yeah
B	so whether he's find it really boring
A	no this is it you want them to have a little go at doing something they might possibly
B	yeah
A	enjoy don't you?
B	I said you could always go over to school as a last resort
A	to school?
B	yeah over there
A	oh really? oh
B	as a last resort
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	well we'll see maybe he will go to one of
B	god he'd love that
A	he probably would could run the erm
B	probably wouldn't let him
A	no they wouldn't
B	cos of the insurance
A	they wouldn't
B	what's he doing in Holland?
A	in Holland that man
B	why's he gone there?
A	he's looking at water parks they're going with his boss
B	oh they're having one in
A	they're going to put in a water park in
B	yeah he was saying that
A	mm
B	mm
A	so that's where he is he's gone on a little
B	so they've gone to have a look
A	two day jolly in Holland or I say it's a jolly it's a
B	told you he's got a nice job
A	yeah he was up at half past four yesterday morning and he'll get back about half nine tonight and then he's off to Windsor tomorrow
B	yeah
A	long two days but anyway said he's had a good day yesterday he facetimed me
B	so they've been to look at some in situ?
A	to meet the manufacturer
B	mm
A	cos that's I think that's the manufacturer they they'll want to use I don't really know
B	there'll be coffee and biscuits
A	yeah
B	and the manager'll be sucking up to them
A	they were going off to a
B	like you wouldn't believe
A	steakhouse last night and
B	of course they'll be wined and dined
A	yes
B	and
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway Holland
B	very nice
A	mm
B	and there's you running around taxi servicing
A	I know taxi service
B	every night now though every night
A	yes welcome to my world

A	oh okay
B	and she was having
A	mm
B	and that I said oh it
A	it was on the off chance
B	so you know I understand that erm and erm I said to her I said I said how are you how is your mummy managing to get to
A	to school er to the train station?
B	yeah that's it
A	yeah
B	and she said oh she said well sometimes
A	oh does he?

A	oh
B	I said oh I said and what about the night times? how are you getting on of a night time after school until mummy gets home? I said cos she doesn't get home till late does she? she said no she said daddy looks after us
A	oh okay
B	she said but he's she said it's a bit of a nuisance though you know
B	cos obviously she's heard this she said if it's a bit of a nuisance I think nuisance was the word but a you know a a negative comment because he has to come to
A	oh so he looks after them at his
B	he must
B	at their I said I said well do you go back to daddy's or does
A	mm
B	he come to yours? and she said no he comes to their house
A	oh I see
B	yeah
A	right so
B	so

A	to the house then
B	yeah so
A	and then back again and back again
B	from
A	yes
B	where he's living
A	yeah
B	to
A	mm mm
B	then to go back to their house and then has them when
A	I know cos it's mad isn't it?
A	cos that half the reason they moved house was so that

B	so now he's in that house sort of
B	every night

B	seven years
A	paying for the roof over their heads and still helping out gotta hand it to her she does do that well
B	yeah but does she sleep at night?
A	er no I don't think she does
B	using and abusing people makes you wonder doesn't it? makes you wonder
A	oh dear dear dear
B	I saw her walking up from school this morning when I went to get my nails done walking with Treacle on her phone
A	mm
B	she was going to work because
B	going to pick her up at twelve o'clock and then I assume she's got a
A	where
A	so where was she picking her up from?

A	no cos that office isn't there
B	oh no in
B	have they still got a
A	oh they've got
A	yes they do still have a
B	she's picking her up from there
A	oh right
B	and then she must be having her nails done in her lunch hour
A	and taking her back?
B	and then taking her back cos she did say to me in the past sometimes erm
A	gosh
B	I wonder if she still gets up at the crack of dawn every morning and goes running
A	I don't know cos I don't know is she happy to leave the girls with nobody in the house? whereas obviously before
B	mm
A	so I don't know I haven't asked her actually if she's still running but
B	but I said we'll have to erm organise for us all to get together

B	she said she's confident enough to get in a taxi and go down to town on her own
A	oh yeah
B	she said
A	yeah
B	I feel confident enough she said I've got enough lingo to
A	yes yeah
B	to sort of not be too exposed as a
A	mm yeah yeah no she could do that
B	a traveller you know
A	that's a good point
B	so she said she'll do that
A	but erm
B	and go and have a wander round town

B	is the town is it a big town?
A	I've no idea

A	it's never been there this is a
B	oh
A	we're in the mountains

B	oh
A	erm
B	yes
A	no it's no we're flying to a different airport and erm
B	oh
A	it's a three hour
B	so just
A	gonna be like
B	no erm
A	no
B	or well they'll be in Thailand won't they? or just coming back from
A	erm
B	that'll be a nice break for them all won't it?
A	yes
B	cos
A	yeah yeah
B	just as they come back they'll have the week
A	yes
B	to the house
A	yeah
B	to themselves
A	that's right
B	I said to
A	you don't have to no
B	but I thought we were in a really busy pub
A	yes
B	you could barely hear do you know what I mean? but I wanted to say well well actually no if you're not happy with it you don't have to put up with it
A	no but she does I mean in fairness I think
B	does she?
A	yeah
B	where does
B	so how did they meet? was it work or
A	it wasn't work I can't remember now
B	oh
A	I don't know
B	they're quite keen on each other
A	seem to be I mean it's been going on a while hasn't it now?
B	a while hasn't it? are they they were together before how long were they together before
A	well
B	cos he's been travelling hadn't and he
A	they'd only just got together when she
B	that's right
A	they hadn't really spent any time together because
B	mm
A	and then she went off to
B	that's right
A	so she ended up
B	going
A	visiting him in China didn't she?
B	that's right she did yeah
A	so that was I think that was just the year before wedding
B	that's right
A	so when was the wedding?
B	and then she came back
A	she came back and then he surprised her for the wedding
B	and then he came back for the wedding didn't he?
A	yeah and it they'll they'll they'll have been married two years this
B	gosh
A	so
B	hasn't time gone?
A	I know so I suppose about three three years they've been together haven't they? three and a half years
B	mm
A	yes cos they'd got together in the summer before the wedding so
B	so I wonder if they'll sort of look at perhaps getting somewhere to live together or
A	well I don't know I think that was maybe the hope
B	has
A	he's self-employed he's erm
B	is it with his leggings or something?
A	he's importing these leggings but he's doing very well at it cos apparently he's given up his job at
B	mm
A	just I think that was only part time but just as a like a regular thing but his his leggings business is doing very well he's VAT registered now so he's got a high whatever you have to have as turnover
B	what's so special about these leggings?
A	I don't know I think it's just quantity rather that quality to be honest
B	have you had any?
A	no I'm not a leggings wearer
B	who's he selling to?
A	he sells them on Ebay
B	oh just on Ebay?
A	apparently if you put them up in put put it up it comes up
B	he's the top one
A	yeah I think so
B	what just put leggings?
A	do you know I don't know I've never done but
B	really?
A	and he's VAT registered now but he looking at doing some some other business but he he hasn't told us what it is yet
B	so he's a bit of an entrepreneur
A	he is a bit of an entrepreneur I know he's been in touch with
B	don't know
A	he's keeping it all a bit close to the chest at the moment erm
B	what's his family? what's their background?
A	erm he's got a sister his mum and dad are are divorced but they're er fairly recently I think did they split up while he was travelling? so
B	separated
A	that he's been there for and she said I think he was a bit conscious that he'd come out to see
B	no
A	an hour and then he went I don't can't even remember
B	how old's his mum do you know?
A	I think she's about our age
B	yeah is she? mm
A	same sort of age
B	mm mm
A	but it was funny cos not long after they had been together I must have told you that story she erm she was talking to
B	her mum?
A	yeah

B	yeah
A	so with mum and anyway no but erm
B	it's better now though isn't it?
A	oh yeah it is better but he he's er
B	yeah do you
A	but no
B	still think there'll always be a little bit of a
A	yeah but I think that's just my mother now getting a bit old and a bit
B	mm cantankerous
A	turning into my nan yeah I do actually
B	mm
A	without dad being here to
B	mm
A	but dad would never let her do it
B	yeah
A	but of course he's been gone what?
B	yeah
A	six years now
B	six years
A	so I think that's likely to be just
B	yeah
A	one of those but erm
B	er a sort of a
A	well yes
B	being allowed to
A	yeah she's got nobody sort of monitoring it
B	yeah nobody sort of
A	or or saying
B	toe the line in
A	having a word yeah
B	yeah
A	oi watch it you
B	yeah
B	yeah watch what you're saying there yeah
A	cos er obviously he was totally
B	you haven't gotta pick her then?
A	but I did say I'm put her some erm
B	I know she's got the taxi
A	she's got the taxi
B	I'm only joking
A	I did say I put some
A	some food in the fridge and turned the fridge on cos she turned her fridge off
B	oh
A	I know why would you do that?
B	oh
A	but she said there's nothing in it
B	yeah but
A	so she turned it off with the door open
B	oh so so
A	so it's all you know
B	been cleaned and everything
A	oh
B	have you been over to check?
A	yes a few times
B	yeah
A	you need to come over actually
A	well I wasn't sure if she had a mouse
B	oh
A	I know I know
A	oh well I didn't see a mouse but
B	yeah
A	it wasn't dripping or if it was she said it was really really tiny so it was nothing bad's gonna happen but obviously if that paper got damp
B	mm
A	change it this was one of my jobs anyway at the front of that cupboard she's got a Tupperware with her birdseed in cos you know what she's like
B	oh
A	for feeding the birds and the lady in the flat behind was coming in to fill up all mother's birdfeeders
B	right
A	so
B	bless
A	so she had the seed in a Tupperware but then she'd bought in a big bag in bulk because it was
B	mm
A	on offer and that's just in like a like
B	like the hessian type plastic
A	like plastic like not even
B	yeah yeah
A	and there was a bit of there
B	oh
A	oh no
B	it's gonna living in the bag of seed
A	there's gonna be a mouse so I wasn't sure there were no droppings anywhere and she had a stack of newspaper should I have needed it that wasn't touched
B	right
A	and she also had some toilet roll in there that was in a in a like a pack of nine or whatever unopened but that hadn't been touched either so I just wasn't sure anyway I came away but a couple of days later I went back with a tin to put the the
B	the bag yeah
A	that was just in a carrier bag inside the tin
B	yeah
A	and I thought okay I'll I'll put that in there the other big of seeds in a in a Tupperware so you know no there's no other food no other food anywhere and I did go back and and it was just that it was as I had left it so part of me thinks maybe a mouse came thought mm seed isn't for me and hasn't bothered coming back
B	and went
A	cos I don't know do mice eat seeds? I mean it's birdseed
B	oh yeah
A	do they? but it was alright I cleaned it up
A	I cleaned it all up and I've put into the tin and and that was Saturday and I haven't been back since but I sent her a a just an email saying no you haven't got a mouse mum don't worry about it it's fine
B	well I I
A	so
B	I got some bird food once can't remember what container it was in now but I took the lid off and there were two little mice going
B	in the shed we used to get them regular in the shed
A	yeah
B	you know cos these
A	well
B	I think they used to get they used to come into
A	oh okay
B	and you know
A	when we had our playhouse and first started putting seed out there was a
B	yeah
A	there was a mouse under the
B	alright
A	oh I know they are
B	I know they're vermin and spread disease but they're they're got you know they've got to live
A	but anyway so I'm just keeping an eye on that
B	mm
A	I'm just keeping an eye on that
B	yeah cos it what where why would you need toilet roll or paper if you've got seed to sleep amongst and just
A	well it's probably in the tin now then yeah who knows? anyway it didn't appear to be I didn't see it
B	did you empty the bag into the tin?
A	no I just lifted the bag up and put it
B	and put it in?
A	put the lid on suffocated it if it's in there
B	oh it's so it'll be dead now anyway if it was in there
A	I don't think well no I would have seen it wouldn't I if it was in the bag? wouldn't I?
B	is it a clear bag?
A	yes
B	oh so it's not one of them
A	it's a clear bag
B	big ones like I get?
A	no it's about it's about this big
B	oh I yeah oh
A	but it's clear
B	oh and there was no visible hole?
A	well it was open the bag was open
B	oh
A	at the top so and there was a bit of shredded carrier bag inside it was obviously it she'd obviously had bought the bag
B	see but he might have got in
A	and it was inside the carrier bag
B	and he can't get out so he might have died anyway might have got in
A	yeah
B	and can't get out
A	so eventually some
B	even before you put it in the tin
A	so eventually when somebody scoops
B	mm yeah
A	they might get a
B	oh
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	I don't know but
B	let your mum sort it yeah
A	there was no
B	cos we were walking erm we were walking out once if you go onto the canal and do a left and go round them woodlands and there was this big erm big bin and we thought what's that? so we had a look at it was
A	mm
B	all seed for birds and that and there was a couple of dead mice in there that had obviously got in but they couldn't
A	oh couldn't get out well maybe I have trapped it but anyway anyway I don't know I'll send
B	yes and pops
A	yeah and pops he got the first mouse
B	yeah
A	that there was ever that I must have told you that story where my mum when
B	yeah
A	did I tell you?
B	no
A	and erm and so I think she'd put a mouse trap in there right at like teatime or something thinking that maybe the next it came out at night and maybe the next morning she was all psyched up for it the next morning well
B	oh yeah
A	so he came round and er he stood in the kitchen eating a piece of toast cos you know my mother liked to make him a piece of toast after he'd done his Cub duties
B	ah
A	and er the dog was there
A	from the kitchen out through the kitchen all down the hall and collapsed in a heap by the front door
A	she just collapsed in a heap going oh my god there was a mouse there was a mouse
A	and
A	and he's still eating his toast and she was just in a heap squealing in the hall
B	oh my goodness me
A	it was the
A	she said I wasn't expecting to find it till the morning I was ready for it tomorrow morning I wasn't ready for it tonight
B	oh dear
A	she'd only just put that trap in there
B	I know
A	oh it was just so funny the way he just like
B	oh dead calm
A	watched her go calmly
A	carried on eating and he said do you want me to move that
B	he is dead calm though isn't he?
A	she
B	good lad that
A	she was and me and
B	oh god
A	but er no I'd have been the same if I'd have opened the door but it was just
B	oh yeah
A	so funny just she I've never seen her run so quick
B	it is scary particularly when you're not expecting
A	when you're not expecting it she just ran so fast
B	oh yeah
A	and fell in a heap
B	yeah
B	well no they're not very nice they're not very nice
A	we had one in our lounge
B	yeah and that
A	in fact didn't I come up to you and borrow your traps? didn't we come up here?
B	did you? did I yeah I think you did yeah I think you might have done
A	that was a few years ago now
B	yeah
A	somebody had left I think it was it was er just after Christmas
A	well it was just after Christmas and there was
B	mm
A	it turned out there was a load of chocolate and wrappers behind the settee I imagine

B	oh it does
A	oh
B	I
A	didn't believe me till he saw it with his own eyes
B	oh
A	I was hopping around the furniture screaming
A	yeah I didn't like it
B	mm
A	he was just laughing at me I said no no no no I'm not stopping with a mouse in the house
