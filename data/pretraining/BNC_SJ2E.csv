B	huh oh oh oh I want
C	what?
B	Legoland
A	or we could go to Legoland then
B	yes mama that's where I wanted to to that's
A	but I think
A	there is you know that last year we went on a Friday because the school was closed on a random Friday?
B	yeah
A	the same thing is happening this summer on a on in June so I I do honestly think we should wait to don't tap the table I think we should wait to go to Legoland in
B	yeah cos I'm
A	the summer cos it was nice wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	quiet and it was sunny and warm
C	quiet?
A	it it was a very quiet day compared to like a normal day at Legoland yes
B	although let's not go to the waterpark again
A	why?
B	because I thought I'd lost you
A	you thought you'd lost me? can you eat your breakfast both of you?
B	I've got a
A	what a tooth?
B	a vitamin
A	a vitamin you thought you'd lost us in the waterpark? when did that happen?
B	erm when I think it must have been
A	in the waterpark?
B	oh wait that was when I went to the little waterpark and
A	I don't remember that
B	and then you were coming down to see me and then I and then I had
A	so you didn't lose we were still in the tiny tiny waterpark of Legoland and it's not like I'd left you and gone off trekking for a couple of miles before I realised you weren't there
B	like going to like Spain or
A	like going to Spain what?
B	like going to Spain or
A	yes I know
A	you say I speak
B	I speak
A	or my country is
A	I think you know more Spanish than I do
B	I don't know that much Spanish to be fair
A	so what about at some point and this has to be warm the wilder wood cos we didn't go last year?
B	I'm quite scared of what if the boat falls over and you'll go in the water?
A	has the boat ever fallen over?
B	yeah
A	when?
B	well one of my friends at school said that when they went to wilder wood the boat the boat fell over and they weren't in
A	they totally did not that's a complete lie isn't it?
C	does it I think
A	isn't it? that's you making that up
B	but not I'm do they actually sail on the water?
A	mm
B	or do they have like things
A	they don't
A	alright well don't do the water bit then don't do the river bit the lake bit you could do everything else can't you?
B	but how do we get across without doing the river bit?
A	we just walk
B	mm?
A	you know we go from the boat to erm a place where you dock the boat and then on the way back we always walk? so you don't think that bit can be used the other way?
B	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
C	yeah
B	mummy I like the broken bridge bit it's got glass
A	so you like the bit where you climb over a very high up bridge where they look like they're gaps but you don't want to sit in a tiny boat for a bit?
A	okay
B	yeah it's just I I'm
C	oh that that erm backslide was great
B	not for me I fell down
A	did you?
B	yeah do you remember?

C	it's a humungous waterslide and it's really really big and you need to have waterproof stuff
A	yeah
C	and and
A	or go on a boiling hot day
C	yeah and then you get into a big erm and you get into a big erm floating thing
A	mm
C	and then it's just and then you shoot down a kind of waterfall thing it's not a waterfall thing cos it's actually in the air it does have posts and sticking them up they're not and there's not much of them and then you go up and then you shoot into another thing that stops you and then you shoot down and go backwards
A	mm
C	and then you go down and it real and then you go down super super super super super super super fast and then it ends
A	and then it ends
B	I don't want to do that is it with water splashing you?
