A	oh they weren't cos it's round here
B	yeah cos that's I I'm wondering if you're wearing I mean they they're too big for you
A	oh
B	the ones you're wearing now
A	yeah
B	so what size are those ones?
A	these are
B	let's have a look
A	yeah these are are we on?
B	yeah erm
A	can you see?
A	right so I could get a fourteen then really
B	so
A	at Primark
B	and what
A	oh there was a fourteen but are we on? oh right erm but
B	yeah
A	so he went on the internet and what he done was is he actually just bought me a pair of Levi's er that have been chopped down into shorts
B	right
A	er so they was
B	okay
A	er but obviously the leg length and what have you they were supposed to be a size fourteen
B	right
A	but when I put them on they looked nice but this bit here at the back there was plenty of room
B	yeah
A	but I'm this is my bone hip oh I'll come this side this is my bone now I haven't gotten I haven't got the excess
B	yeah
A	baggage that I had on top of it
B	yeah
A	I'm sure it was a
B	yeah I mean it's easier to
A	oh I ought to have mine as well erm it's it's a pink case in my handbag
B	oh
A	that's a first it's normally glasses case and no glasses
B	well I have a I have a I have a pair I keep at work and a pair I have at home but I'm cos I'm finding I need them more and more now I don't want to take them room to room
A	yes I am
B	and I'm always like oh where are they where are they?
A	I am er and I went and checked while
B	mm
A	er and they said it's not till next year and I'm thinking crikey I really am struggling at times but I'm finding it's cos
B	if you're struggling go and get them done earlier
A	well it's cos I'm so tired as well
B	yeah that doesn't help
A	er and it doesn't does it?
B	no
A	and if I start wearing them at the beginning of the day come the end of the day if I take them off I'm like
B	yeah
A	but looking at them
B	what the screen?
A	yeah
B	yeah well you know me biggest is best
A	er well this is it but I mean
A	er
B	exactly it's just junk it comes through about this time every day
A	yes I keep getting them
B	do you get the government ones saying that you're entitled to a new boiler and
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	get all that crap and sometimes when I'm there I get it and I'll answer it and then it's the
B	I know
A	but it's filling up my answerphone
B	yeah I know I find that you come in and there's a message and you know what it's gonna be
A	yeah
B	it's just it's annoying so annoying
A	er but I rang up to find out how I could stop it er and BT were like oh yeah we can stop that I'm like I mean no problem it's gonna cost you I think it was like something three pounds something or whatever more a month
B	yeah yeah
A	er and I'm thinking but it's getting that bad now where I think I might do it
B	the trouble is though it it comes up as international calls and withheld numbers and unavailable numbers so actually
A	mm
B	and then they can't ring the people because it's all on
A	yeah ah
B	are you on the telephone preference service?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah cos we're on that as well
A	but it's a waste of time
B	mm well I I think the ones when if it comes through with a number I mean I've got on my actual phone I can block numbers
A	yeah I can on my mobile
B	so if anything comes through with a number no on the actual phone phone on this one
A	oh
B	I've got it on here look I can go in and just on the settings
A	yeah
B	so if anything comes up with a number I
A	and then it
B	so that blocks it
A	oh mind you our phones are old so that's probably why but I could do it on my mobile
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so actually that wouldn't stop because you can't stop the erm
A	no
B	the things
A	there used to be something years ago though cos I done it for nana and grandad when they was both alive so I am going back a while
B	yeah
A	er that
B	yeah
A	for you to be able to ring certain people if they'd got this thingy on you had a code that you had to put in front when you rang the number
B	right
A	so then that way the call would then come through to that person
B	right
A	because they'd got like a block on their phone
B	mm
A	but
B	okay
A	yeah
B	that's good yeah
A	er so then like all them businesses you see they couldn't get through because they haven't got the number in front er
B	no that's a good idea
A	anyway deary me
B	right so ahem
A	I've had a shower this morning mind you I've been into the market
B	you don't smell
A	no don't I can't you even smell my perfume oh Christ that's bad
B	no I can't smell your perfume
A	oh
B	what is it you're wearing?
A	Kylie Minogue
B	oh I don't wear perfume not at all
A	er
B	sounds daft but I get fed up of the smell
A	now you see I can never smell it so I I'm like this and I'm like
B	you put more and more on
A	yeah sometimes I can be a bit
B	people say oh put different ones on different days but I
A	well I have to spray it so it's on my clothes
B	yeah
A	cos if I do it round the neck and what have you
B	yeah do you get a rash?
A	it yeah er and cos I used to do it they used to tell you to put it here and here and rub together
B	yeah
A	and then I got told that you should put it behind the backs of your knees as well
B	yeah the idea is you put it on a pulse so you put it on the wrist but you shouldn't even rub perfume because it breaks down the erm the thing of it changes the smell
A	oh
B	so you should just just spray it on and just
A	I started them coming up and what have you and everything so I thought oh I'll erm spray it on my clothes
B	spray it on your clothes mm
A	so
B	okay so jeans
A	yeah
B	erm so where do you normally get your jeans from?
A	well I haven't bought jeans well apart from those ones I've done on Ebay
B	yeah
A	I couldn't tell you how many years ago it was that I bought jeans cos I went into Primark er and I just get these jeggings
B	jeggings yeah
A	and that's all I've been really having
B	okay
A	erm so the jeans that I had in my wardrobe I wouldn't even know where I'd got them from how long I'd had them
B	no that's fine what we'll do is we'll start on ASOS because I tend to buy things off ASOS erm Mango Oasis places like that and then I look out particularly if they've got sales on because the they can be quite expensive erm I'll tell you another Wallis I get
A	yeah
B	and with Wallis if you when you send for it it's sort of I think I'm not sure if it's about three pound for delivery but it's free return and
A	oh that's good
B	so that's yeah that's the thing you want to watch up cos if you start buying like I buy everything online and then I send loads of stuff back
A	yeah
B	but I always look and find the people that give you free returns
A	yeah
B	er like ASOS which isn't loading with ASOS I pay I think it's about fourteen pound a year but that means I get free next day delivery free returns erm and also get a like advance of different sales and extra money off things et cetera so
A	I was going to say
B	yeah
A	er and one of my dresses that I've got is erm
B	yeah they're good
A	actually I think I got two dresses summer dresses
B	yeah
A	but see it's now going into winter and I got no winterwear
B	yeah well it's up to fifty percent off sale jeans
A	oh
B	so let's let's start on that then and er okay let's go size fourteen do that do that go on yeah let's make this even bigger mind you it's a bit deceiving you do that and actually it's just white at the sides so that's gonna make my eyes go buzz eyed
A	well
B	do that if that's alright that's the easiest easy enough to see isn't it? okay so that
A	yeah
B	erm and how many is that two hundred and thirty-one styles so we'll look at them all and just see so I mean stuff like that is no good with the rips and stuff in and like unless you want rips to me I just think that's a bit
A	well you can do that yourself and I mean like round here and what have you men it tends to rip quite easy cos they're forever scratching aren't they?
B	yeah
A	oh they're yeah
B	see they're nice they're slim
A	yeah
B	and they're quite high waist
A	and high
B	so I always do middle high waist because the low rise ones that's fine for kids but I don't think that's right so
A	no
B	I'll tell you what we'll this with ASOS I I'll just get
A	okey-dokey
B	I think that'll be the easiest way to do this cos then
A	do they have like leg lengths?
B	er no just the size
A	ah
B	but but I
A	oh
B	okay sorry take it back
A	oh crikey where's the right
B	trouble is when you get into the sale thing is quite a lot of things aren't available so erm thirty we were saying thirty-four see thirty-four inch waist
A	is sixteen
B	that's a sixteen
A	so it can't be so I want a
B	so you really want to be a thirty-two
A	ah
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	so if you're thirty-two
A	and the thirty-two leg
B	thirty-two length that's the
A	yeah
B	see these are these are a thirty-two
A	yeah
B	yeah? and how long are your legs compared to mine?
B	stand up and be counted yeah hip to hip so we're about the same length of leg so a thirty-two would be fine for you because then it's just sort of here so it means if you're wearing it even with Converse trainers or your Doc Martens that would be fine
A	hopefully then yeah
B	but with heels as well cos when you when you're up with your heels it sort of goes
A	over the
B	yeah
A	it goes over it
B	right so what we'll do is we'll just go yes yes yes yes then we can look at the
A	I was gonna say cos some of them other ones were thirty-four
B	right
A	er so but I can see can't I? try them on and
B	yeah see again made from stretch cotton denim so that's another thing I usually look for stretch cotton
A	oh
B	because that gives it's like it's like these are they're just just that little bit
A	yeah I like that
B	of give in it
A	I find that's that's more flattering as well
B	and I like it as well if I can normally get T-shirts with it in because they keep their shape a lot better
A	yeah yeah yeah okay see if there's something
A	so oh
B	well I was just gonna have look
A	it doesn't give you they're in blue ah so it's that blue
B	yeah
A	that's alright
B	there you go that's them bigger look
A	how did you get that up there?
B	I pressed the zoom underneath it
A	oh
B	yeah? so now I've found when I send for jeans sometimes it'll be a size ten and I can't get it up over just over my knees and I can't get it any higher and I'm thinking what? and then other times a ten it fits fine and sometimes it's big so this is why I tend to order a lot of stuff and it's like when you're at a shop remember we went to Primark that time and you went in with about six trolleys worth to try on and you went home with about five trolleys worth of stuff
A	mm
B	when I get loads of them and I'll
A	so it's with ASOS
B	yeah
A	er do you pay for them all
B	mm
A	and then you get them er
B	pay for them send them back and then
A	and then if whatever you send back and then they credit you
B	so
A	erm well I pay with PayPal you got PayPal?
B	yeah
A	yeah I pay with PayPal and they just put it back into PayPal and then you go into PayPal and you draw it
B	ah and then you yeah
A	et cetera I've usually spent it I'd spend it on other stuff so I tend to just
B	yeah
A	unless I if I if I bought a lot if I bought sort of three hundred pounds of stuff and then I send loads of it back and I've got two hundred pound credit I'll go into PayPal and get it back out but if it's twenty thirty quid it just tends to
B	yeah yeah
A	ah so some of these places then they do use PayPal
B	yeah ASOS almost almost all the places I've shopped through again they use PayPal
A	yeah I like using PayPal
B	yeah
A	yeah oh look normal jeans that go round your waist
B	see exactly yeah this this is what I
A	you see cos that's really difficult to find them in the shop
B	yeah I know I know it's just a fashion of what it actually is but see look these are twenty-one pound now
A	yeah
B	so add that to the bag okay so that's in my bag and we'll go back and then see what else there is so right so there's those ones just shout if you spot any or I'll just like some of these like the tight skinny ones I I find normally things like that they'd be the ones you struggle to get on cos I
A	yeah I wouldn't want tight skinny ones
B	no
A	I have skinny jeans but tight skinny jeans I you might as well just wear tights so
B	right so that's
A	that
B	those ones you were looking at or which ones
A	oh oh I just saw them I thought that was pretty but you can do that
B	oh yeah yeah with rhinestones down the side
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna get a hot fix gun so I can do that anyway
B	mm
A	then but they're enough the same colour as what them other ones were aren't they?
B	yeah but but there might be an option for a different colour in two colours
A	oh
B	light or dark but to be fair if you if you send for this and the others only one of them might suit or might fit so out of the two you'd probably keep one although these are fifteen quid and the others are twenty so actually if they're both right you might think okay I've got two decent pairs of jeans now
A	yeah
B	you know and so
A	this pair looks darker denim that what over to the other
B	it does yeah
A	er
B	so
A	fourteen
B	fourteen size guide see what it says UK fourteen oh I see that's just and it's all how to measure you
A	inside leg right so what is?
B	actually I've got a thing right hold on I've got a thing that ASOS sent me it's a tape measure which actually measures you to show you the ASOS sizes I've never used it but let me see if I
A	ah well this could be fun
B	yeah
A	is only up to five foot three it's probably a bit more than I am but about me
B	so what are you?
A	it says model's height on that picture
B	yeah that's what I find's good with ASOS as well
A	it
B	it tells you how big how what size the model is
A	is that five foot nine and a half inches?
B	so eight hang on let me put the thing on yeah five foot nine and half so she's quite tall
A	yeah she is so
B	yeah right now I've not used this I don't quite know how it works
A	oh this I gonna be good
B	so women's colour code hips bust bust
A	oh why is the
B	okay the I've got no idea
A	there's no numbers on it is there?
B	I haven't I've not actually looked at this so I don't know mm womenswear colour code that doesn't make any sense then
A	no because there's no numbers on it where's the?
B	well it's probably something came with it it says how to use it
A	I was gonna say where's the instructions? did it come with anything?
B	maybe but I wouldn't have kept them
B	alright so my bust is orange
B	okay right let's look I'll open another thing and see whether there's a thing on here how to use it
A	there's there's nothing on here
B	ASOS
A	hips hips bust
B	tape measure oh that's different languages
A	er like I say it's got hips and
B	ASOS tape measure guide
A	bust but there's nothing on there anyways with regard to legs
B	we're all out of them I don't know if that'd be easier I dunno ASOS tape click here to size tape watch the video to see how to use your ASOS tape
A	right okay
B	this could be interesting
A	yeah they might erm
B	it just came in with something it was like here it is and
A	well yeah no
B	it's it's useful if erm
A	it had numbers so you could measure cos you can't measure your inside leg with this
B	no but I bet you probably measure round and it'll say if you're green blue blue then you're a size ten or twelve or whatever let's see what it says
A	er
B	it's on the right side
A	oh trust me I'm in the middle of the blue and the white underneath there
B	go round here
A	oh I'm on the middle on that of blue and pink er green and pink
B	I don't know we'll see what this is but if not then
A	I was gonna say you can see what's gonna happen
B	the thing is though if we if we send for something that's a fourteen and it's too big we'll you know we'll send it back and get a twelve
A	twelve too big? mind you I need to shift this half a stone that I've put back on
B	alright no we'll add that anyway so
A	no cos this is we'll just discard that
B	yeah we'll probably just throw that away the computer's just going really slow
A	you see cos that colour as well
B	yeah
A	they're nice like she's got the heels and that and then you've got a nice top and what have you they're you can use them for going out
B	yeah definitely
A	like you do
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	cos you have a nice pair of jeans on then with your top and your shoes and whatever
B	yeah yeah come on add to bag
A	whereas the ones which are lighter aren't so
B	no they're not dressy are they?
A	they're not
B	whereas a dark pair of jeans
A	and black
B	black or dark jeans
A	you have to watch it because the black and what have you I mean these I ought to throw these out they're miles to big
B	alright I'm going to go back in again cos somehow this seems to have got mixed up
A	has has it got erm lots of things running on the background?
B	well no there's nothing going I don't know what's going on it's just having a moment it could be there's there's nothing on that
A	I sometimes like with my phone I think what's going on? erm cos it's not erm working and then or it's really slow and then I notice a little arrow up here which keeps coming down
B	oh and it's er doing data
A	which means it's updating and that and I'm like oh that's why
B	er there's something going on here
A	ah when was the last I don't remember that
B	oh that's that's from the meal
A	excuse me
B	that's actually one it was
A	excuse me sorry
B	taken with a few other people and I've cut it down that's why it's a little bit blurry really it's a bit sort of too zoomed in for erm
A	looks alright
B	let me just see it might be Google so I just if I put in ASOS on try this other search engine if not I'll shut the computer down and start again
A	oh look there's a bit of me there
B	looks like
A	I was gonna say yeah
A	oh
B	no that's me
A	oh I was gonna say all of a sudden that blue thing went across but now it's stopped
B	this is it you sometimes find sometimes it just gets a bit stuck it's alright I'll just I'll restart it and that'll that'll wipe it start it and start again
A	yeah start from the beginning
B	mm
A	that was lovely that well what I can remember
B	oh you were fine until you had your tablets and then you zoned out slightly
A	mm and that's where I can't remember anything
B	yeah
A	er
B	you you were very well behaved
A	cos I said to
B	no you you were fine you were just really slightly
A	mm gone
B	well
A	no
B	yeah
A	er he said but you know he said I said to him well you know this is what happens and that when she's had her last lot which is true it does
B	yeah or no cos you
A	that's why I try to leave them as late in the evening as I can
B	yeah
A	er I like to take to them probably an half and hour an hour before I go to bed cos then they start kicking in
B	then they start working yeah
A	er I mean like left here last night took the girls outside
B	mm
A	er went and had a tiddle and everything got myself ready for bed
B	yeah
A	er girls all came in and I had to count that I'd got all of them in
A	yeah cos Imogen when it's nighttime and with her moving so quickly you tend to miss her
B	yeah she's in and out in and out and actually which way did she end up being?
A	erm so I count and it's like yeah oh I've got something in the bag
B	yeah that's the first part that we put in
A	oh right
B	it stays in there I think for two hours so
A	oh right but erm and then I said come on we're going to bed well cos like Trudy was there a bit worried so I put her on the bed and then she started whinging and what have not whinging but whinging because the next thing Page had jumped on the bed cos I'd go the quilt on and if they know that quilt's on you see over the top of my bed linen then they can come on the bed
B	oh right yeah they don't go on until that's on there
A	so no and erm then cos Holly came waddling through and looked at me and sort of so I had to try and pick her up and that's like a miniature pig
A	er so I picked her put her on Maddie then wanted to be on so the dogs were all on the bed before me so then I was trying to get in bed and Trudy trying to get snuggled in to me like she does
B	mm
A	er
B	these are these are jeggings black high waist jeggings I just thought they might be nice with heels
A	those yeah
B	right let me do it bigger sorry cos er
A	that's nice
B	they're like denim ones aren't they? I could see you in them with your heels
A	mm I like them
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	oh right what we'll do oh right so there's a ten to twelve or a fourteen to sixteen oh that's gonna be a problem I think cos you'll be sort of in between we'll get both sizes but I think you'll find one'll be too big and one'll be too small
A	big and one's gonna be too small
B	but we'll put them in now and we can always go back later on
A	oh them other ones went
B	oh I put I just put them in
A	oh you just put them in
B	yeah oh I shop at the speed of lightning
A	well yes I can't see this
B	okay hold on so
A	erm
B	you see there they were those ones I've just put them in
A	there's those ones
B	erm yeah so there's I just thought they looked nice so I think we're on the lookout for some straight leg ones as well cos I mean they're straight leg but they're quite shabby sort of look whereas they're not
A	yeah no I don't
B	they're a bit scruffy erm
A	they're straight leg they're not bad
B	those ones? they're quite tapered in though let's have a look they're forty-three quid as well G-Star they're
A	they've yeah they've got a dart in them haven't they? they've
B	yeah yeah they're they're like for kids really cost they're sort of scrunched all round your knee
A	yeah no they're
B	those ones they look like you've got wet legs at the bottom don't they?
A	they the well yeah it looks like they've took the bottoms off from one jeans and sewn them on the other
B	I know you get all sorts here it looks like you're been wading through bleach with those ones
A	yeah don't you remember though and I never did do it but I knew somebody she used to get her jeans
B	mm
A	and she'd get in the bath of water
B	yeah
A	to shrink them so they'd then fit her
B	really hot yeah
A	yeah er but she would also then sort of stick them stones around them and elastic bands and that er and then put bleach on so she could get the
B	yeah the stonewashing or tie-dye right yeah yeah
A	tie-dye or yeah and I used to think why don't you just go and buy them? cos you could get them like that
B	yeah exactly
A	you see now that says that that's a skinny jean but to me looking from here that looks like a bootleg the way that it kicks out at the bottom
B	yeah that's it that's what it looks like to that's bootleg
A	and I don't like bootleg
B	no I don't right
A	yeah no I put the telly on and I'd got my Ipad so I thought right I'll get moving on this the next thing I knew I woke up so I don't think the girls probably was erm watching the telly and I didn't do anything on my Ipad I just went out like a light
B	mm
A	see they're not bad but they don't say what
B	which? those?
A	oh they're printed paisley those but they don't say
B	it's alright for a bedspread
A	yeah no
B	not to wear
A	no no no no no
B	right mm mm mm mm mm mm
A	it must be the fashion there's another one there look
B	yeah I think they sort of run out of things to do don't they? and then they just
A	mm oh no they're skinny
B	yeah
A	have they got an option at the top? put it so it's straight legs
B	yeah yeah but I'm just looking we're nearly at the bottom look and you see that's down there now so
A	oh right yeah now what's the boyfriend jeans?
B	they're I think they're sort of like when they're meant to be like blokes' jeans so at the top it's a different cut so they're more slouch a bit slouch and a bit looser and they've got this stupid thing at the knee again
A	yeah
B	but no they're weird
A	cos I've I've
B	I think
A	there's that mind you they're in red and that but I mean either are they? no they say skinny don't they? they're not
B	mm
A	no no no
B	well the
A	erm yeah they look better there are them blue ones
B	they're nice different high leg
A	and they're different
B	yeah you you got a big thing on the back there though Monkey Jeans so it's whether you'd whether you wanted that on there
A	that oh I can soon take that off
B	what even with those stud things?
A	yeah
B	ah right no it's not available in your size
A	ah not available ah got to be a skinny minnie

A	yeah
B	while it was actually getting going de de de de de de de de while it was actually getting going de de de de de de de de de this is it and then you'd put something in and you'd quite happily sit for five minutes cos you knew it was going to bring something up that you wanted to look at

B	yeah exactly
A	you want it to go just work

A	it is
B	for this season she says sounding like a fashion queen this season back in trend
A	well yeah no you are you're far more trendy than me
B	but I don't follow fashion I don't wear things because they're in fashion I just I'll look through all this and I'll think oh I like them and then I buy them

A	it's
B	it doesn't work
A	well not unless you live down London and you're sort of nineteen or something but
B	oh yeah well but oh and look at them with the bits sticking up
A	I know sticking up you get cramp in your toes
B	it yeah

A	yeah
B	in fact actually we'll look at the non-sale jeans as well because we might find there'll be some straight ones
