A	did you?
B	yeah
A	well while you're cooking it's okay I mean
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	yeah
A	like over the past few days like really hot and that
B	yeah it comes  it comes  at you
A	eh?

A	well you just sort of like don't expect it and
B	yeah
A	so yeah I mean it's
B	D'you wanna tea or a beer?
A	uh tea uh yeah beer actually
B	the bar which is could be the world's smallest bar would be like uh
A	D'you remember the last time we were away? D'you remember when we saw?
B	it's it's like ten centimetres wide
A	D'you remember the last time we were away? We when we saw that
B	oh yeah that was um
A	yeah
B	you know like the pub was like the house but the bar was it was very small and very
A	yeah
B	sometimes go into a pub and you think this is like the most bizarre pub like
A	what's the pub you've ever been to?
B	but the the one we went to uh on holiday was uh um
A	what's the best pub?
B	Cos
A	yeah
B	there was like a  there was like a  reserved table like someone had reserved it but but it was actually quite empty inside
A	what's the best pub that you've ever been to?
B	well I was I think I've said this before actually uh
A	oh the Berlin one?
B	it's the it was the student one in um hall of residence in Berlin uh
A	yeah
B	because of the I mean you could run the bar yourself um
A	that's pretty good
B	but you could  you could  you write your name down and
A	when it's your turn?
B	you book  you book  a a night
A	yeah
B	and I think it was pretty much any night of the week or
A	did you do it then?
B	you book a night
A	yeah
B	and uh no I never did it um
A	why?
B	you could keep some of the profit like uh
A	you shoulda done it
B	I know but I didn't uh I just didn't un didn't
A	prefer to be on the other side of the bar?
B	didn't
B	yeah I mean well that's the thing I mean obviously there there is always an element like you can you could kind of
A	yeah
B	the pool was the pool and uh you know table football were free and um
A	I hate when you have to pay for that sort  that sort  of stuff
B	the the music you could play your own
A	someone's house?
B	and it was quite cheap as well I mean a bottle of it would've been like one Euro fifty for
A	yeah
B	that's like in those days was a pound
A	yeah
B	but like yeah it was
A	yeah
B	Cos they didn't have draft they it was just bottles and stuff like uh

A	D'you think I shoulda made the strap longer?
B	like a little uh
A	well I was gonna
B	so could get like Theo Paphitis on Dragon's Den and like try and wreck  try and wreck  it
A	ah don't snap it
A	I was gonna
B	um
A	D'you think I should've made the strap longer?
B	it will have to be able to withstand quite a lot of weight
A	D'you think I should've made the strap longer?
B	um
A	yeah
B	but you've already got like
A	I'll just redo that bit
B	few centimetres
A	it's okay I can unpick that and just

B	yeah yeah yeah
A	um who put the salt into the sea?
B	something like that yeah
A	who put the colours in the rainbow?

B	yeah
A	she said that she'd bought some like Jiff Lemon and I said Why d'you buy Jiff Lemon? Why didn't you just buy lemon? She said Oh well they only had them in like bags in Aldi and I would never eat a bag of lemons and I was like
B	ah well they do last quite a long time in the fridge
A	well
B	fair enough
A	I must use a lemon every single time I cook something
B	yeah I mean we sort of replaced used it as a replacement for
A	yeah
B	um
A	how's that? Have a taste
B	I'll just try a bit of this
A	have a taste and see
A	quite nice

A	no
B	oh right
A	it's quite tepid
B	oh well I'll just turn the oven on
A	oh that's nice
B	oh is it? Well put a bit of lemonade on the top of that to
A	oh yeah that'll be  that'll be  really nice
B	have
A	so I decided to get nice juice
B	I still didn't even realise there was a difference until you mentioned it
A	well I just watched a thing about it and they were saying like
B	they are pulped up
A	makes sense
B	A bit of this uh that starch
A	hey
B	um
A	oh it's a shame that  it's a shame that  um Take Me Out's not on
B	well you know you can't have everything in life and uh
A	oh ha ha
B	sometimes
A	okay
B	no I mean I was trying to be I was trying to say the sort of thing that you would say
A	I thought you were
B	no it's just like
A	Britain's Got Talent
B	yeah
A	it might be good though cos it's the early stages
B	uh the freak show stage
A	the freak show stage
B	no I'm not not a big fan of that actually
A	I don't understand the I I mean I understand part of it but I don't know how like them people get on the show in the first place
B	I quite like it tepid actually
A	ooh it doesn't need to be like
B	uh recyclable
A	oh leave it cos I'll put some seedlings in
B	yeah
A	let me have a look at these so
B	try a bit of this
A	which ones I'll have to put them in order
B	yeah
A	all of them can I think
B	that is rather tasty
A	uh these have to these tomatoes have to be sown in so
B	Cos
A	so you've got runner beans tomatoes peas
B	ah that's really nice
A	it's really good isn't it?
B	that is tremendously nice
A	Leek
B	it
A	marigolds for my tomatoes yeah I know
B	sunny D
B	right
A	autumn king carrots and white Lisbon spring onions
A	so the idea with these I think I was reading something earlier is that you keep sowing them like
B	yeah
A	and then you have them all the time
B	yeah
A	sow thinly in rows ten inches apart
A	okay
B	oh yeah uh you know the shallots
A	scallions aha
B	yeah so this orange juice is good innit? Unfortunately I think I've had a bit too much of it
A	what sorry?
B	I've had a bit too much orange juice
A	put a bit more lemon in then
B	oh yeah
A	oh there's some really good ones
B	on the topic of doing things ourselves it'd be good to do um
A	so which should we grow?
B	and I was thinking about like if I wanted to make like my own Coca Cola type thing
A	yeah
B	and how I would do that like
A	yeah
B	you you seemed to suggest that they weren't  that they weren't  legal in England is that was that true?
A	no I didn't
B	yeah
A	and I said Do you mean in Aldi or do you mean in the United Kingdom
B	but like
A	and you said Oh yeah like there's gonna be ruh ruh

B	that was a quality limerick
A	thank you
B	um who was the author?
