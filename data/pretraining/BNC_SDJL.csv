A	funny mum was just telling me about when you saw some English people I got two flakes in mine by the way do you want another one?
B	no
A	when you saw some English people in er in somewhere in Belgium where were you?
B	erm Antwerp
A	and you said you were from Mars
C	no I said I'm from Mars and mother's from Venus
B	no the woman said that
C	oh was it
B	no
A	it was her that had that bit yeah at least she knew what to come back with
B	mm
A	I hate it when people it's always Americans come up to us abroad and go oh I'll have to say something or give you some advice about something I'm like no
A	just cos I'm white too
B	that was that weren't far from those sex shops either
A	oh wasn't it?
B	no
A	finding their way down there too
B	I think it was a mother and daughter cos she was sort of my age and she was with an older woman
A	oh right I thought you'd say was gonna say her daughter was sort of my age
B	no and they'd come in on a erm cruise ship
A	oh yeah
B	they were doing a
A	probably then you do see like a few like package tours as well for Belgium come up on online and stuff like that
B	mm
A	I saw one the other day cos on Trainline you see it a lot and then you can go over on the Eurostar or whatever but erm there was one for the Christmas markets cos that's an expensive time of the year to go there and it it was really like five days or something was like eight hundred pounds or something
B	really?
A	mm
B	but that being everything I should imagine that'd be your meals as well I would have thought
A	I don't know maybe maybe the accommodation
B	mm
A	I thought it's just five nights and accommodation erm maybe some meals time of the year though those Christmas markets in Europe are really popular all fairytale like there are some more napkins here dad if you need them
C	no
A	well do you want a bit more Flake mum? no? ah I got the special one did I? finally had our Mr Whippy and a Flake at the beach
C	how did you how did you how did you end up with two flakes?
A	cos they gave us one
A	wasn't paying attention maybe
A	stuck one in stuck another in
B	and that it it was her that said they were supposed to have stopped at Brussels
A	oh yeah
B	but because the traffic was so bad that they didn't cos it would have took too long to have got into Brussels and they wouldn't have had had enough time then
C	that that that helped me make my mind up anyway
B	so they they erm
A	oh did it?
B	yeah so they spent two days at Antwerp instead but she said we're not at all worried she says it's lovely here
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if you only had a couple of days
B	mm
A	how big was Bruges? it was smaller than Antwerp was it?
B	I thought so
A	mm
C	it was still big though weren't it?
B	but it was big yeah
C	huge
B	well it was smaller than Antwerp
A	mm
B	mm
C	but Antwerp you could walk up the main road
A	oh right
C	that's how the difference is if you know your way about do you remember that bit dear? along the front when we come down the steps we could have gone up then to start with
B	yeah but that was that was still a lovely long way along there
C	I know but it was still quicker than going right round like we did
C	stretch my leg out
A	oh really?
B	yeah they've got like footpath the instead of the road going up there it's made into a footpath and they drive over the footpath
C	over the footpath
A	mm
B	to go up the side roads
A	to cut to cut up the side road
B	mm
C	if you know where you're going it's so quick and easy but like me and mum we never had a bloody clue
B	no
C	there's nothing in English
A	erm I didn't know they cycled so much there
B	yeah
A	makes sense
B	in Antwerp
A	yeah
B	a lot a lot of cycles
C	thousands of bikes
A	mm I feel like there's a load here but that's cos you just don't see them that often in England
B	mm
C	yeah that'd be nothing to what's over there
A	no yeah I bet not
C	you could walk you could walk from here to that pier and there's rows of bikes on most everywhere you go
A	you'd probably quite like going to Holland actually
B	mm
A	it's even smaller they'll have flea markets and stuff as well
C	we do a left and a right
A	and they're basically bilingual
C	come out and have our own
B	yeah I do think a lot of erm
A	a lot of European countries are French Italy Spain not so much they're not quite so good at it
B	no
A	but erm Germany Holland Scandinavia in general they're all really good at English
B	our television in erm the room as well had a
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I think that's why they get really good at it I think I I assumed they just you know had a really good education system for it which I think it's not bad but the girl the Dutch girl on my course is doing it she didn't start learning at school until she was eleven and they have English television
B	mm
A	with no subtitles
B	mm
A	and it's a part of their culture almost now like but you'll hear young people talking Dutch but then talking English and stuff like that like they they see
B	mm
A	and they have done for a long time apparently
B	yeah
A	it's
B	mm
A	when they had like the slaves and stuff like that erm and he said interestingly cos the Dutch are really good at it he said that they typically have always
B	ah
A	they would have tried talking to them in English or something else so it seems like it's just been a part of their culture for centuries so talking in other languages and whatnot and we never did that in English basically
B	yeah we're lazy with the languages
A	mm
B	terribly lazy
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and er if our jobs or whatever depended on it then maybe more people would be motivated but they don't
B	well if you go and
A	live somewhere else yeah
B	like
A	mm
B	mm
C	bloody hard them old cornets aren't they?
A	mm
C	they ain't like those original ones are they?
A	no
C	where did we buy that one and we dropped it straightaway?
B	you did
C	great big double one it was where was it? Hastings or Eastbourne?
A	no
C	somewhere down the coast huge one and it stood there like that for two seconds and whop it went on the floor
B	no it went flop
A	saw a woman do that really recently where was I?
C	Herne Bay weren't it? I think it was Herne Bay
B	no it wasn't Herne Bay
C	where we seen B Q
B	no no it wasn't Herne Bay
A	where did we watch a lady do that? we
C	there's some old antique shops down here closed weren't it do you remember where we went that time to see B Q? it was Herne Bay weren't it?
B	where we saw B Q that time was Herne Bay I don't remember any antique
C	we went round the shops but they was all closed weren't they?
B	I don't remember
A	don't remember
B	mm I don't remember antique shops in Herne Bay
C	yeah
A	when did you go to Herne Bay?
C	oh
A	where's Herne Bay again?
C	not far from

B	yeah I think so
A	save some money
B	and the weather'll be changing as well won't it?
C	see how it is might do one more out before Christmas somewhere local
C	and see what happens after that after Christmas
A	got a few weeks yet

A	I know you did need all the kids like it don't they? gonna sit here and watch it it's all er what are those shows called? the Bob the Builder and whatever
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	he used to get his screwdriver over dad's bits and pretend to poke it and do stuff on it
C	yeah yeah
A	they grow so quickly so fast don't they? it's a shame he's
B	got up this morning and come up to you I think I've grown overnight again mum nan
A	oh did he?
B	yeah he says let's have a measure
A	is that what he says?
B	yeah
A	you do a good impression of him
B	I I do honestly think in another two years time
A	as tall as you or taller yeah
B	I'll have a ten-year-old grandson taller than me
A	cor I hope he doesn't get too tall
B	I think he's gonna I think he's gonna get bigger than
B	and he'll end up about six foot four six foot five
A	bloody hell
C	he still holds my hand when I take him to school
A	oh no
C	yeah
A	he's still a little one isn't he? he's kind of soft really in some ways
B	oh he is he is he is quite erm soft as well
A	well yeah it's having his grandad baby him and being an only child
B	and being an only child as well probably
A	having a mum and dad on and off all the time
C	yeah bloody good job we are there
B	I think it's
A	oh yeah I don't think they'll go down that route again
C	nah
A	tried it that one last time
A	I think they get moments of affection for their shared over
B	you never know she might marry
B	yeah I know
A	she's just got to not be too divvy and lose him
B	yeah
A	he's gotta put up with her yeah
A	go round that way yeah he might
B	and I think he
A	no that's probably quite appealing
B	yeah
A	but you'd think he'd want his own kiddies wouldn't you? but she swears she's not gonna have any more
B	perhaps he don't
A	it's true
C	well if he does they're not coming down mine to bloody look after I'll stick to my little mate and that'll be it for me
A	yeah I don't think she'd be expecting you to take in someone else's baby
A	go to his
C	no favours
A	if anything happens little
A	I know I don't think she'd ever ask you to look after
B	well since we moved there wasn't he?
A	yeah did dad even change a nappy or two or was that something I made up?
B	oh no he used to change his nappies and
A	wipe his bum I know that's disgusting
B	nobody else does for him
A	no of course not
B	yeah
A	it's funny boys would even
B	no they wouldn't
A	definitely something different there between the sexes we're like no we can do
B	yeah
A	ah no it's what being a grandparent's about grandfather anyway
A	no his
B	no
A	or any other grandkids
B	no
A	only
B	but then
C	I've had him since he were a baby haven't I? even before he started crawling he before he crawled he used to
A	he used to drag himself across
B	his arm
C	his mum'd come and pick him up he wouldn't let go of me would he dear?
B	no
A	lovely little boy but yeah ah see if
B	yeah so don't go making any arrangements
A	oh right well I need to make arrangements don't I? oh me making arrangements with friends or with the children?
C	the children
B	the children
A	oh
B	well not now in case you change your mind
A	oh yeah but if I leave it too late they won't might have plans won't they?
B	oh I doubt it
A	probably not I'll give it another week I'll think about it but I don't know how else I will
B	no
A	remember where we're parked dad?
C	yeah
A	where are we crossing then? this one or the next one?
C	this one right here
A	yeah I think so testing you that's all
C	near the
A	daughter
C	it's clear and all innit?
A	you wanna look right is it clear?
C	yeah
A	oh
B	I wasn't
A	with those little legs of yours
C	yeah we'll have to go there together
A	eat some of their food that brie baguette
B	the brie baguette was at Antwerp I'm sure
A	ah I'm sure Bruges has something
B	just as nice
B	just just for the car and two people
A	oh right
B	whether it'd be more for three people
A	it'd be a little more for three or four people I suppose
B	yeah
A	but maybe nothing too dramatic something manageable I would have thought
B	yeah I mean you
A	and that's return isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah so compared to catching a plane or whatnot anywhere cos I mean sixty quid just for one person on a cheap flight isn't it?
B	yeah well it cost us more than that for the ferry to Isle of Wight
A	oh you said yeah well isn't that stupid?
C	well we've gotta go left daughter
A	I wonder how long did the ferry take?
B	two hours
A	oh that guy just jumped out didn't he?
C	nearly two hours
A	yeah two hours long enough then
B	yeah
A	and then you gained an hour there and then lost it on the way home is that right?
B	no it's the other way round
C	other way round
B	oh yeah no no gained it there
A	yeah you went yeah you yeah you know what I mean
B	yeah
A	yeah sorry I guess you lose an hour actually going there and then gain it coming back
C	do we wanna stay left dear?
A	yeah I mean you wanna take whatever left you can take dad this one by the looks of it
C	that's a dead end I think darling that's a dead end
B	no not this the next one
A	yeah that
A	you
C	I don't think we can go up there
A	you can someone just went up there we did this last time cos of these controlled zone signs you kept saying we can't go up there you bloody go up there
C	oh yes we can now I know yeah
A	do you remember? and we ended up driving all the way down
C	oh the Costa Brava
A	what does that mean?
C	we're there to cushion it
A	this is the street you parked on originally
C	yeah
B	that erm place next to the
C	oh yeah yeah I thought it was
A	I didn't know if you were talking to me or not there
C	yeah oh yeah it's where we parked daughter weren't it?
C	I know you did
A	go straight up
C	we can't it's a dead end
B	this is the dead end that's where you
A	no you can take a left up there can't you? what is that a dead end? why can I see cars and that up there? alright then take the next right
B	you can't go straight up
A	oh yeah yeah I see I see I see
C	well you've gotta go right down here now ain't we?
A	yeah take the next right if you can
C	okey-dokey
A	lemon and pokey
C	we'll get in there don't worry
B	pig in a pokey
A	is it pig in a pokey?
B	yeah
A	okey-dokey pig in a pokey
B	okey-dokey pig in a pokey
C	look at the little blonde haired girls look
A	yeah cause it's pig and pokey cos
B	mm
A	odds and sods all this kind of thing there's a reason like we would never do it the other way round and it's something to do with the vowel sounds
B	ah
A	so it and ah pig and poke would make more sense than poke and pig it just doesn't sound right does it?
B	no
A	because we do the
B	ah
A	I'm can't sure bric and brac pig and poke yeah I guess it's the short vowel before the long vowel maybe it just rhymes better to us so er yeah that's what we do there's are loads of them on there I can't remember them all now oh can't wait to have that wee again
A	got to park on the just park on the yellow lines at the end of the road dad
C	I'm going to if there's
A	it's not far
C	no no I know darling
A	oh look at that Jeep
C	yeah pukka ain't it?
A	those tyres on it where are you going?
A	yeah mad hatter that's what it is when we first came into here yeah thingy was fine wasn't it in Caffè Nero the chain?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	go on mate you can go now that's my boy
B	yeah
A	happy happy days glad I did that bit of couple of towels I washed today now hopefully they'll dry but they're not having any
C	where are we going straight over daughter?
A	yeah straight up not having any direct sunlight definitely affects it
B	do you put them on the balcony?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but then it doesn't get any sunlight that side the opposite houses opposite us get the sunlight it's fine cos our back rooms get the light which in the winter is will be warming more warming
B	yeah
A	than the bedroom but erm yeah
B	are them sort of jeans still fashionable? with all the rips and tears
A	oh no I mean it they're rare now it depends on the person I don't think so they were coming back a little bit in Korea and er sometimes what happens in Korea you'll see coming on here I think I don't know why just
C	buy just buy an ordinary pair
A	I know well why would you wanna pay money on something that's already got holes in it? just wait until you've worn through a normal pair
C	it's like with that
A	that's what I do
C	buy these jeans and half the legs are missing
A	I think you can take this left dad
C	yeah you're right I remember doing it last time
