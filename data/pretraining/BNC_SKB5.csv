C	it's just a normal hour hour-long conversation for us to be honest
A	sounds a bit like one of mine stopping and changing
D	yeah
B	it's funny cos we have like two different conversations we'll have erm eh the main conversation and then we'll have like be like aw interlude we'll have a little conversation and then we'll go back to the original conversation
C	yeah like a tangent
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	that's what you do sometimes though
D	what?
B	yeah like I'll start a conversation in my head so the first line that like the first start of the conversation I will say it like in my head
C	like
B	but then I'll say to
D	aw poor
B	I do apologise though
C	yeah I know yeah
B	cos I realise what I've done and then I'm like sorry aw sorry it's my fault I'm such a dick
B	cos I do get really frustrated I'm like why do you not know what I'm talking about? like how do you not know? I've just told you
A	see I'm not the only one that gets frustrated
B	but I get right pissed off I'm like why the fuck? why? like do you listen to anything that I say
A	yeah I get pissed off
D	eh no
A	to the left
D	tell the right tale
A	what? at the
D	turn right
B	even though he means turn left he's say
D	no he's telling me to turn right but pointing fucking left so how do I know?
A	no what it was I went I went with your mum
D	and he went absolutely ballistic
B	I can't right I'm sorry right but I can't be in a car with you two you both drive me up the fucking wall
B	you both just drive me insane it's like you cos you can't drive now you become a back seat driver
A	oh
B	aka a dickhead and you don't pay attention
A	yes
B	so you're both just as bad as each other but like you don't pay attention to him because he keeps he starts shouting at you so you just close off like whatever and then you'll shout more and I'm just like will you both just shut the fuck up and use a satnav like and then there'll be no arguments
B	and then he can just do it and then he can stop doing my fucking head in about it
A	yeah but your mum who passed her test before I did still drives in fourth gear at twenty miles an hour
D	first first time
A	yeah but yet she don't know how to go through the gears
D	passed the test
B	so
A	it's
B	but there'll be stuff about you that annoys her when you drive so you can't sit there like I am a perfect driver I am a perfect angel man and I am perfect and I get to do this and I get to tell people to do that you can't do that
D	when you when you drove over two hundred thousand miles in two years we had one accident in
B	you
A	I think you're mum slept with an examiner to pass get her licence
B	my two cents about you two and driving I am never going to get in a car with you two ever again unless I need to like shopping or something
C	yeah
B	they're the terms and conditions
B	and you're putting the fucking satnav on the next time in the car right? cos I don't like listening to you two shout at each other
A	if your mum went from fourth down to third when she got the roundabout I wouldn't be shouting at her
B	I know but you shouldn't shout at each other anyway
D	you don't go from fourth to third you go from fourth to second so there
D	oh yeah
A	anyone that passes their
D	it's clear
B	well I haven't passed my test so basically you're you're telling the wrong person and you're moaning about it to the wrong because like
A	ask ask
B	I know but then maybe like just don't let her drive oh no wait you haven't got a choice so just shut up
B	grin and bear it
A	when she goes with it does this car in I ain't buying another
B	well exactly just grin and bear it just don't pay attention to what she's doing that's what I do just pretend that I'm listening and I'm actually not that works for me
A	but every pothole she has to hit them
A	she cut my hair last night
D	payback
B	I can tell
A	I were cringing
B	well I'm not being funny
B	it's going to fall out soon hi how was the lecture? was it boring?
F	hi
D	she doesn't really know
B	she's on the phone
F	hi
D	oh
E	hi
F	I wasn't being rude
F	right we can talk again
B	fucking
A	even your uncle
B	it probably will but I still don't want to hear any arguments about it that's why I'm going outside for a cigarette you two can stay in here and argue all you like
C	I think the lighter's in the kitchen
A	no I'm coming you mean that one?
C	it's
B	yeah don't be walking away with my fucking lighter I'm watching you two in my
C	sorry
B	erm not till about back here about ten but yeah we're going back to
D	yeah
B	be
A	so you'll get home for about eleven then?
B	yeah if we leave straight away but we might have some tea first
A	yeah
B	so I don't know er
B	no he does he starts at nine o'clock in the morning some days doesn't come home till ten
A	I thought that's hold on cos I thought I'd heard him on about that he was sat in at nine o'clock some mornings and he done twelve-hour days
D	oh right yeah
B	he's doing longer than that but it's because it's the beginning of the season
D	yeah
B	that's why as soon as everything settles down and
D	yeah
B	then it'll all go back to it'll go back to normal hours but like today he didn't go in till like half twelve because he was supposed to have today off but he wanted to do some admin stuff so what he did were he went in late turned his
D	yeah
B	but like the chairman will ring him at like eight o'clock in the morning he's just like what are you doing? why are you ringing me at eight o'clock in the morning? like but he doesn't know how to tell him to fuck off politely like he just wants people to like him and stuff like this
D	yeah
B	and it's like
D	yeah it's just
B	tell them to fuck off he gets one day off a week on a Sunday
D	yeah
B	that's it
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	but he's got a work phone now so he's going to send everyone his new number and tell them that he hasn't got the old number anymore
D	yeah
B	so he can just turn his work phone off
D	yeah
B	because it's bang out of order these people ringing him like all hours of the day like he does have a life as well
D	yeah
A	yeah cos you're born to what what's the word? you work to live not live to work
B	yeah but it's really hard for him cos like he doesn't have any friends in
D	yeah
B	like the only friends he has really is the hockey lads and my friends
D	yeah
B	which are his friends as well obviously
D	yeah
B	but like last night I went to the
D	yeah
B	and I think he's getting a bit fed up with it I just said to him like try and make some friends
D	yeah
B	so
D	yeah that would be hard
B	yeah but he gets paid twenty-five grand a year so
D	mm
B	he basically gets to do what he wants it's only now at the beginning of the season
A	that's got to be ten grand more than what he were getting at
B	more than ten
B	yeah he really enjoys it
A	he will be once it settles down
B	yeah he really enjoys it it's just the beginning of the season
D	yeah
B	so like he's only like a few months of the year that he's this busy
D	yeah
B	because season finishes in March April so sooner come that time he'll have
D	yeah yeah
B	so and cos he's only just started the job
B	yeah I mean he gets like we would never have been able to go to
D	yeah yeah
B	do you know what I mean? so it is swings and roundabouts but
A	my mate he had a right job him he were a chemical fireman in
B	right
A	six weeks on three weeks off it'll pay for the three weeks off and it'll be like that you know the rota so literally he only worked two thirds of the year but were paid for the full year and then he got his four weeks holidays on top as well
B	yeah yeah
A	to take when he wanted
B	paid for every single day you work
A	yeah
B	yeah danger money isn't it?
A	yeah they were
B	yeah
A	erm
B	but they have all the protective gear and stuff don't they like it's dangerous but it's rare that something happened

D	mm
A	so our
B	yeah
D	mm mm
A	cos he he'd smacked a known paedophile and that lot cos the paedophile had been winding him up and that and it were his first offence they put him down
B	ridiculous

B	just upload them on to Dropbox fill a form in and that's it and then I get paid eighteenth of every month so I'll
D	and can you just be talking about anything or?
B	yeah I'm recording this conversation now
D	yeah
B	it doesn't matter at all like they just want to it'd dialect and how you use your mouth and stuff to speak and
D	oh right
B	why are you fucking doing that you piece of shit?
B	why can't you convert it?
C	mm
B	but yeah it's erm running for two years so you can
D	yeah
B	I will declare it like
A	does it go into your bank?
B	yeah
A	watch it taxman can actually with your accounts

B	why?
F	you just don't care
C	awful
B	I'm sure they were I'm sure they were thinking of exactly you when they did the timetable for the whole course
F	in my last lecture in my last lecture I got so bored I started
F	and the amount of weeks in a semester
B	how much per lecture?
F	about fifteen pounds
B	that's that's not bad
F	it's not bad but when you sit there and you're like I have to spend the next forty-five minutes in this room and that's going to cost me thirty pounds
B	so it's thirty pound a lecture
F	but no I had a double so it's fifteen pound for an hour
B	oh right okay it's really sad really really sad
D	it's costing you? oh yeah cos you pay don't you?
B	yeah it's not free
B	this is
D	yeah I met her the other day
A	why? what's next Thursday?

A	see you ought being like me clever and didn't go to university
F	sorry?
D	you're not clever
A	you ought be like me be be clever but don't go to university just get a job
B	are they in a can convert list? MP4
F	mm
D	that made sense
A	well I did college is like university but
D	college is not anywhere close to university is it?
A	still the same sort of thing
D	it's studying
A	yeah
D	but it's it's like primary school to sixth form college isn't it?
B	why is that not fucking erm this is such a pain in the arse I'm going to say that right now cos I've
B	so like I've got to delete them all erm reformat and then upload them again and it like no one else can use the internet while I'm doing it that's why I'm doing it now before everyone gets back although everyone is now back
D	yeah
B	erm so it's just a pain in the arse cos sometimes it doesn't format them properly even though I've tried doing it again oh well
A	so how many lectures a week do you have?
F	erm many wait let's figure it out do we include two hour lectures as one lecture?
C	yeah
F	okay one two
B	right so that's done then why is it saying it isn't fucking done?
A	so it costs you nearly two hundred quid a week?
C	it costs the same as

A	how many years are you doing?
F	three would be bachelor's but I want to do a master's which is four I also want to do a year in industry which is five but on the year in industry I get paid and I don't have to pay
A	ah right so you're looking at what? thirty-six grand then? in all four all four for for the four years

F	no you do you pay less I think you pay one and a bit grand
B	well that's well you're not even at fucking uni so why are they charging you? it's fucking ridiculous twats
F	yeah there is that but you get paid like between seventeen and I think seventeen and twenty-five grand
A	oh right so that actually balances it out
B	what? a year in industry? you don't get paid that much
F	yep you do in my in my placement you do because I've already looked at it
A	engineering is big money
B	I'm doing the wrong fucking degree

B	depends what engineering you do it can be building sites
A	yeah
B	but she's doing chemicals so
A	ah
F	yeah buildings are civil but even then it's not necessarily building sites it's mainly design
A	yeah it's not any more how to structurally make everything sound and that lot through the engineering side of it?
F	sorry?
A	it's how to knowing how to use the right components in the engineering side on you know the engineering? the civil
F	yeah
A	erm what angles and that you can get away with for the strength? and what beams?
