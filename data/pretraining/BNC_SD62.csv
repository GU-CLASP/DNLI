B	yeah
A	oh I see
B	it's food and drink if I remember right
A	so
B	it's quite hard this
B	mm
A	so that was they're all cryptic ones

A	Extreme
B	he's got his
A	could be
B	yeah
A	that's her
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so
A	right

B	she cos she's M in Bond isn't she?
A	of course she is yeah Benidorm
unknown_female	ah
A	yay we got two answers
A	three
B	hey is it are they on that there so you've got like
A	yes
B	and again it can be
A	but that H that's a erm
B	yeah
A	something
B	yeah which I don't know
B	could
A	yeah
B	looks like a car thing doesn't it I don't do car things
A	mm I was gonna say it looks like a deacon's sort of
A	but it's not I know it's got a like a spaceship on it something
B	yeah
B	mm
A	that's
B	W K plus R P
A	yeah
B	so it's yeah W K
A	W K
B	and then that's erm the Premier Inn isn't it?
A	yeah
A	again it it's a distinctive logo for something isn't it?
B	yeah
A	this is hard
B	apparently this is something like
A	mm
B	arrow
A	I was thinking erm
B	but yeah we're not worried if we don't get it it's just
A	oh no no it's one of these things that it's just good to have a look at isn't it as you say? and have a go
B	so films with cities or countries in their title that's that's Rio
A	okay
B	that
A	that's
B	yeah it's
A	films with cities or countries
B	no
A	who's that?
B	that's erm Scarlett Johansson
A	oh right
A	P
B	don't know
A	I don't know
B	they they are really hard they've made em really really difficult that's the problem
A	yeah it's almost like it's too difficult
B	yeah
A	it should be
unknown_female	oh
A	oh that I know what that one is
B	some bits of
A	you need to have words with him
B	I don't really know him
A	that's like it's lonely at the top when there's no
B	think that's supposed to be a clue I think he's taken out some of the letters
A	so that's
B	no it's not that's part of the logo
A	oh
B	it's just that he's taken out
A	mm
B	so
A	well it's all got this about maple leaves and that so it's something Canada
B	so it's
A	yeah that so that's just English
B	you have you have to write the name of the
A	yeah
B	that's Captain America
A	you see you're on a roll
B	well I knew a few of them anyhow when I looked at it the other day
A	see I don't know who they are
B	that that's
A	oh is that? no
B	erm that's Will Farrell Ferrell one of them
A	Colin Farrell
B	Colin Farrell exactly the same person they're the same person
B	I've got this
A	that's Eddie Murphy
B	I don't
A	oh okay
B	I have no idea
A	mm
B	it is really difficult and that's the problem I get that you wanna make it difficult but
A	mm
B	there's making it difficult and then there's making it too difficult cos if people find out it's too difficult a lot of people who maybe have bought it probably won't buy it because they know they're
A	yeah this is true cos they know
B	it doesn't tell you as well it doesn't tell you what you win
A	mm
A	I think that's Coming to America
B	so we've got two Americas that's pretty random
A	mm hm?
B	yeah that's what I was thinking that's it
A	but
B	yeah I think it is
A	that might be
B	yeah it is cos they no it cos they it it is cos they jump across the thing
A	Italian Job
B	because Patrick Swayze is not in Greece
A	that's not that's Kirk
A	Kirk Douglas
B	don't even know who Kirk
A	he's Michael Douglas's son
B	oh yeah well yeah
A	Kirk Douglas
B	but but I don't have an idea
A	films
B	I don't know
A	he's not Michael Douglas is he?
B	that's the last page but it
A	Douglas brothers
B	mm hm
A	he went to South America
A	Laxessa
A	and then it's an anagram is it?
B	I don't know
A	oh
B	I don't think so cos
A	cities and countries
B	have you got this song? the song is so good Francis named it twice I assumed that was New York New York
A	yeah
B	Frank Sinatra?
A	Frank yeah Frank Sinatra
B	I don't know
A	the ex-policeman likes his tea and toast in the Big Apple
B	see I don't think that's what it is
A	no
B	yeah but I don't think it is and I think it's more literal but just
A	the thing is you you have to either be
B	yeah that's what it is you've gotta be on his wavelength and he's done it really obscure
A	yeah
B	but also like you've gotta know the songs and a lot of what he's done is really old references
A	yeah
B	so again it makes it even more difficult
A	yeah
B	see I think if Patsy Kensit's ex would be maybe are they meaning Ricky from Eastenders or are they meaning her literal ex
A	oh was Patsy Kensit in Eastenders?
B	she was erm
A	that's Patsy Palmer
B	is it?
A	mm
B	thought that was Patsy Kensit
A	Patsy Kensit is
A	she's the one
B	so
A	I'm not yeah Northern Ireland
B	oh that was Patsy Kensit?
A	yeah
B	what's she in?
A	er she was in Emmerdale Sadie King
B	yeah
A	then she was in Holby City
B	so again it could be her literal ex or it could be the ex
B	mm
A	Spock's mother
B	that's all the tea in China? all the tea in China?
A	no I think that's just a saying
A	really not thinking what he's
B	trying to think of a song with China in it
A	China in Her Hand
B	yeah Spock's mother was making sure you were holding the finest China China in Her Hand
A	oh in her hand? yeah China in Her Hand
B	well who sang it?
A	China in Your Hand
B	yeah so she made sure you were holding it
A	yeah
B	who who sung it?
B	what's Spock's mother called?
B	so probably the sound that it is is it cos they make sounds don't they? sound's probably T'Pau or something like that
A	yeah
B	but this is what I mean you've got to understand
A	oh right
B	but no one else does
A	yeah this is it as I was saying unless you're on the same wavelength
B	but hey I've given a pound to
A	well yeah that's the main thing
B	you just you know you
B	oh I was thinking this one when Harry went to
A	could be
B	but again I need to know who sings it
A	I can probably
B	I'm just gonna go with that cos I'm probably
A	mm
B	kind of
A	Fresh Prince of Bel-Air wasn't that Will Smith
B	I don't know
A	er Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
B	but then
A	er Florida's in where?
B	Bel-Air is in Florida
A	oh
B	so I'm thinking he's thinking Harry and Will
A	in a Bel-Air mansion
B	mm where is Bel-Air?
A	I er dunno
B	he
A	mm
B	erm
A	okay
B	yeah

A	sort things out and
A	yeah
B	I don't know whether that's what it is but
A	we're not gonna get anything
B	no
B	shall we give up?
A	shall we give up?
B	yeah
A	what's the second page? just let me skim on that again
B	it's a
A	the one we've abandoned earlier
B	yeah it was the food
A	oh
B	yeah
A	bitter cabbage could be sauerkraut
B	yeah
A	maybe
B	Polish pastry?
A	erm oh that's baklava or something isn't it?
B	yeah probably
A	erm
B	yeah
A	could be
B	pastry
A	pasty
B	Polish pasties not pastry sorry
A	ha ha
B	could you hold that a minute?
A	yeah I think it's this paz-te-ki
A	new one
