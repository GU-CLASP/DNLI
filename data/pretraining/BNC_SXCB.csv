D	like wade
B	and just like that's
D	what do you do wade?
A	what's that?
D	I don't know sounds like
B	wade them
A	did you just drink that?
B	yeah
B	I accidently on New Year drunk a half pint there was like this buffet and I had like a pint glass and I was so drunk that my friend just kept putting the buffet in it and I never realised
A	what was the buffet?
B	like sausage rolls and like
D	like food and stuff
B	little
A	put booze in it
B	yeah true
D	it doesn't even have a straw that's lame
B	I know it's like definitely was like sausage rolls hitting me in the face while I was drinking
B	so that was gross and then I lost a wrestling match to a girl
B	then I fell in
A	you fell in a what?
B	I tried I made a date with a sixty-year-old woman to go skinny dipping on New Year's Day
A	it's a great line
B	and exposed
A	to the village
B	yeah we were at like
D	for New Year?
B	yeah
D	where?
B	in
D	what where?
B	she's got this this house that's insane so it's like you know the
D	mm
B	it's just like basically you go down this like National Trust path that's like five minutes' walk from the cliffs it's in like National Trust land it's next to
A	yeah
B	but her dad is like this
A	and like a not like a good one
B	yeah he's no he's like he's a terrible businessman but still makes like millions of pounds
A	what like morally bad but
B	no he's just bad a he's just bad a business and no one likes him
D	oh shit
B	so he basically anyway but he was having like this affair with like a couple of women in the village
D	ah
B	yeah and then my friend
D	does
B	yeah
D	and she doesn't care
A	as do you
B	no she doesn't care like well he's not married to her mum but erm but my friend
D	mm you'll still haven't told her you've ruined her dad's life
B	yeah
D	have to get round to it next
B	I mean it can't be that ruined like there's been
D	it can't be that ruined if it was already bad
B	yeah
D	can't ruin something that's already
A	so what kind of like
D	I've never been there
B	didn't go inside
A	no I don't mind
B	there's this
A	got a pool table in it?
B	dunno there's this arcade
A	what you just sit there?
B	you just sit there there's not even a screen even you just sort of like sit on the motorbike and don't go anywhere it's like a motorbike on treadmill basically it's pretty shit I went to
B	and none of the machines work in the arcades but they don't put out of order things on them and I was like I
D	it's well out of order
B	it's well out of order and I complained cos I'm like in to complaining these days
D	and didn't want it
B	yeah no I didn't and my friend got the same ice cream and got loads of pistachios on it and I moaned and they overheard me moaning and they're like do you have a problem? I I like really I was like that's really unfair you got loads more pistachios and then the guy was like do you want more pistachios I'm like yeah and he bought me another ice cream with loads more pistachios on it and then I got the bill and he charged me for two ice creams this is such a boring story
D	he charged you for two ice creams?
B	yeah and they were like seven pound each so I like complained and then he gave me another free ice cream and I was like
A	so you got you got two you paid for two and you got three
B	I paid for one and I got three
A	oh
B	and loads of pistachios so then I was complaining totally works so I complained about the arcades
D	where where were you?
B	at
D	erm yeah also if you get if you if you like
B	really?
D	well like cos obviously his staff were like totally took it it was quite funny actually like I'll make it a short story but she she he had this member of staff working who was always always always stitching him up like come in late not show up and like sort of lie about it to get out of shifts and stuff and then the
B	yeah
D	she didn't change it in any way but the main thing that she did wrong just cos it was like supposed to have been in January like twenty
D	he was like
B	hasn't happened yet
D	no cos it's like a leap year it's like the one so it actually doesn't exist
B	oh
D	it's like so I got this email that you sent either three years in the past or when you're in the future but either way like it didn't come through yeah anyway so he was like look we were like you can't have the shift off and like you've obviously sent me this like really awful lie like she didn't say anything she didn't go to work to the shift and then
A	physical warning
D	not matter what physical warning
A	you have to do a warning can you do like a written warning and then like just ten minutes later fire them?
D	I don't think so I think I don't know actually I don't know bit there's a definite like clear thing that you have to do and he didn't do it so
B	what so then he?
D	so then she wins man he has to pay her stiff
B	how much?
D	well it's like they're closing the restaurant in three weeks anyway so it's like the rest of the shift that she would have done
B	oh is it at thingy?
D	Railroad yeah so that's three weeks' worth of work erm and then I think you have to do like severance pay so he reckons about six hundred quid could be worse but like also sucks just to have to give it to her she's like
B	what a dick for actually pursuing it as well
B	I'm sure like you know when like mad like people in really urban corporations get like fired cos they're like fucking prostitutes and then they get like two million pounds severance I'm sure people just do that on purpose
D	hard to get another job then though
B	don't need it when you get get like
D	you have to open a street food van or something maybe a hotdog van selling hotdogs I once heard the best erm like announcer on the train it was like the lady was like maybe she was erm but she she she was like talking about what they had in their erm the in the snack cart and she was like and today we have special get one sandwich get one Kit Kat free lucky
A	lucky
D	everyone's a winner on this train
B	mm
D	we went we had dinner at
B	haven't they moved to
D	no he hasn't he's still based in here but he's always
B	what was he saying?
D	just saying
A	he said that he's a green man now
D	he's a green man now so what? don't you have that turn of phrase here?
D	unless you mean alien no erm but basically he's had this like thing ever since I've known him but I think even longer like he got really really stitched by his agency with like you know how they send your book out and whatever you wrap up like a debt to them
B	oh yeah
D	he was earning a shit ton of money and then he was like you know can I have some money back? and they were like no you owe us like a hundred and fifty thousand pounds he's like what? I've been like doing like really well for ages for years
D	and they're like no no no you owe us loads of money so he was working really hard doing loads of like campaigns and shit to the trade farers and then like when I got back from
B	yeah
D	so anyway they've got him right by the ball by the shackle and arms you know and
B	by the shackle and arms?
D	by the shackle and arms yeah
A	by the ball single ball
D	yeah ball
D	and then he's finally cleared it now so apparently in
B	yeah to invest there the ones like agents are so fucking retarded I deal with them every day and like they lose their like clients so
D	really?
B	yeah like one the other day we were like
D	yeah
B	but it's also like you kind of balance it out though it's kind of fair like the way we do it cos like we put like loads of money on like corporate jobs so then like when we work with photographer so say if if we worked with
A	it's sunnier now
B	like we do all this editorial stuff for him but like pay for it and like so he doesn't have to pay anything to use that portfolio
D	that's what that's what they were saying like I think that's what the
B	yeah but agents don't do that production companies do that
D	I think that they they were covering for like editorial but they were charging him for it cos they were like oh when you wanted that thing like and we sorted it out for you this is how much it cost but they never told him that you know they were spending this money on his behalf erm
A	yeah
B	it is amazing the amount of money the amount of shit we buy and just charge random people but I kind of like
D	like
B	yeah like the cold press but we lay we
B	a pink carpet across the entire office which cost two thousand pound to get fitted and then buying the carpet on another job cos we had to get carpet for this other job it was AWS some like fashion chain
D	when you said you were getting a pink carpet I meant I thought you mean like  a red carpet like for her birthday just laying down a pink carpet
B	oh no no we've got like a pink carpet actually
D	yeah you need a pink cake? get a pink
B	yeah got a pink Lamborghini pink limo erm
D	that's so naughty how do you pretend that's part of the job? the carpet
B	because there's like loads of people like some people ask you for backups some of them will ask for backup but it's like Robin Hood like you stick like
D	oh I see
B	you steal from your stuff from those people
A	that's right you
B	you steal from those people and then like
D	bring out the pink carpet
B	then you're like other ones you like give them free shit you like help them out it's like you do a job for Zara and charge them like five hundred grand and then you give and then you do a shoot
D	roll out the pink carpet
A	bit of castle
B	we're not
D	oh yeah how was that?
B	and she's gonna basically her parents are gonna inherit a castle
D	yeah I've heard of that
B	and I was like so she's basically gonna be a princess if you get a castle
D	are you are you pissed off that you broke up with her now?
B	yeah like honestly I was like fuck let me know about the castle and maybe
B	that's my biggest incentive of people other people is like what I get out of it a castle land
D	what are you going to
B	no but erm
D	erm let me know how it goes with the castle maybe we can get back together
A	I want to get a castle as well actually how fucking cool
B	but she was saying when she was like
A	but you become a princess how do you do that?
D	marry a prince
A	I was
D	George you could hook up with George
A	first gay king yeah gay king
B	don't think it'd be the first
A	look how sunny it got well good
B	oh look at that cool light? there's a Tesco in
A	must be their depot
B	that's so cool
A	what is this place?
D	I don't know man
B	do you know how many mines there are in Spain?
A	a lot
B	there's not that many mines in England I don't think like
A	had
B	I dunno there's a witchcraft museum that's in a mine
D	where's that?
B	Cornwall the witchcraft museum
D	is it any good?
B	never been I've been to the
D	pretty magical
B	pretty pretty magical
A	how long do you think it takes to learn to drive?
B	ages
A	I didn't think that
D	it's like it's like a week it's like a week in like
D	so I'll take that one fifty quid
B	d'you know what though horse
A	yeah see I think that's what it'll be I thought in car might be a bit like that
B	I mean you can learn to drive like it's easy to drive but like you have to learn so much shit
A	the theory test?
B	no the theory is easy that's just like common sense
A	and it's like when to look in your mirror and like due to have to develop those sort of habits
B	yeah it's like no one
A	cos I did a
B	cos it's really
A	motorbike one and passed that and you've got to do stuff like look in the blind spot every five seconds
B	yeah it's just basically all the stuff you have to do is really like counterintuitive
D	you could probably do it do it now when you've got when you're young you can learn things in ten minutes
B	yeah but I reckon it would take about six months
A	what?
B	well you do like one lesson a week
A	I'd rather do like three a week and do it in like a month
D	I want to go to boot camp
A	it's a grand though you can definitely do it for cheaper than that
B	having a car is the best thing in the world
A	exactly that's what I was thinking
B	you can literally
D	you you learn to drive I'll get a car
A	and then also I can get a bike and have people on the back
D	I ain't getting on the back of that
A	you liked it in
D	what are you talking about you nearly killed me on a push bike in
A	yeah that's cos I was drunk I wouldn't drive a motorbike wasted
D	people were like what the fuck people were literally like
B	dude
B	when I was in
D	oh my god
B	and they still hired it to me
B	fucking idiots
A	you still hired the same one can I have another one please?
B	no yeah I got a different
D	yeah
A	that's like remember the one we got in
B	I'm getting a car next time we go
D	which we don't we didn't find out until it was nightfall and we were like
A	on a cliff
D	on like his precipice of like curvy and lost like definitely definitely miles even from the next turning like didn't know where we were no signal no headlights
A	and
D	I don't know left or right so I was being the eyes
A	she's like right I'm like that's the cliff on the right
D	I can see the bend and so I was like telling him which way to go but I fucking like fifty fifty on left and right really like when I get I'm like he's like are you sure? we could so easily have died but then we finally saw some lights in the distance we were like let's just go to that
A	we'd been doing it for like an hour or like two hours
D	it was cold we were just in bikini like it was cold and it was just so stupid
B	both in bikinis
B	got roll
D	we were like yes we'll just hang out here get the bike in the morning drink some wine eat some squid so and then we were like
B	yey squid
D	can they had started packing up the restaurant and we were like okay do you know if we can can you book us a cab to go home the guy's like what? no what are you talking about  a cab? oh man we have to drive these fucking tourists home
A	he drove us home
D	he drove us all the way via his wife and like his daughter and his new baby and he had to be like sorry I'm not coming for hours cos these bloody idiot
A	it was like a hour drive as well
D	took us home but then I gave him a bunch of money in the end and I think he was like mm not expecting that cos like it was
A	yeah he was pissed off and like just like not like wasn't mean
D	wasn't mean it was nice erm and then we went bank the next day to get the bike and he was he was happy to see us
A	I like the little bike
B	they're so fun
A	they're so fun

B	no it pisses me I
B	so they put the baby in front of me
D	so you had
B	and I like honestly I had a twenty-two hour journey with this baby just
D	what's your worst flight experience?
B	this got worse basically actually you know what this I had quite a few bad ones this was bad like basically the baby threw everything at me I'd wake up just covered in like whatever it had
D	oh my god
A	like why didn't they swap why didn't they swap with you?
B	and then the parents I have no idea and they'd like look at me and like you got to be like you can't turn around and be like your baby is fucking horrible it's not cute anyway and then so we had to change in
D	oh man that's bad
B	once this is actually the worse I still have now comprehension how this happened I was getting a plane to
B	so then I had to oh that was a really bad plane experience but the worst one of all time is I was going to
D	yeah that's
B	jamming it
D	people do that with the touch screen it's like it's like you do not need to touch it that hard
B	yeah it's like it's called a touch screen like you don't touch yourself that hard do you
D	not poke poke
B	not the
A	did you why did you say anything to her?
B	no I just kept looking at her
A	you got to say something on planes
B	oh plane journeys are always terrible I hate I hate it
A	I think they're funny man
D	I used to love them but now
A	that's the best bit man
B	I used to love it cos it's just like it's the best bit
D	the best bit of life
A	the one our one to
D	yeah it was fine
A	especially when they were
B	I never had I never had like do you know actually the worst ever the worst ever I'd been to
D	oh my god
B	and I woke up and her husband was like looking at me and I I freaked out I was like I'm so sorry I really apologise I'm like so sorry but she was like and I just feel straight back asleep and woke up again in the same
A	I did that on the way to
B	the
D	yeah no no I haven't seen it
B	it's the one where like the girl gets her like legs eaten off my a killer whale
D	I watched it on a bit of that one plane actually
B	oh my god it is like Marion Coutillard or whatever she's called and I woke myself up by doing I was really drunk it was in
D	yeah
B	what's it called?
D	DVT well that's the official
A	actually I have had a bad one
D	what?
A	when I went to from Heathrow to
A	and like I was woke up and I didn't have any hand luggage or anything and I couldn't they were so fat I could literally not like couldn't get the attention of anybody
A	and I didn't there was no TV on the plane there all the magazines were in Spanish I didn't have a phone I didn't know what time it was but I didn't know how long I'd been on the flight or anything I couldn't work out I was like had nothing to do I didn't know how long it was going to go on for and I was just stuck there between all these fat people like staring at the back of a plane seat like doesn't that sound bad to you?
D	yeah that sounds awful
B	yeah that sounds pretty bad
D	I had one that was really bad but it was kind of lolzy after a while I had a kind of if you can't beat them join them attitude I was like oh well better to enjoy it where like there was like a couple and they were quite chubs and erm they pulled down this like when they get on the flight they like immediately got out this massive like M and S like bag stuffed with food and I was like oh sweet they bought food for their whole trip it was like no man they ate it all on the plane
B	cheesy dizzles
D	all these like weird snacks you know and erm anyway the guy had a er Ipad and he was playing Fruit Ninja and he he was just sat there doing this like the whole trip right and I was like
A	out
D	and after a while he was just like I know right? after a while I was just like yeah man good
A	I went I went on a quite bad one to
B	no way
A	and like by the time we got on the plane people could barely walk like half the people on the flight were like wasted
D	oh my god I had a really funny picture there
B	being an air hostess must be the worst job in the world
D	I think some people really like it but yeah I agree
A	I think it I think it was it's got he's like
B	yeah it used to be like quite glamorous in the seventies
A	do you know that guy that
D	Ryanair people it's just like you work in shop
A	my mum's you
D	yeah
A	he was talking when he was over once his dad was an air pilot in like the seventies and they used to go to
B	yeah
A	and he like was based on New Zealand or whatever so every flight was long and
B	that where most
A	he was in New Zealand yeah
B	cos there's like loads of land to fly over
A	they used to do like shit loads of smuggling
B	really?
A	like cos they had a had a memory of his mum like sewing in the pockets to like stash gold in into the dad's flying jacket and when he put it on he could barely walk cos it was so heavy with gold
D	it's like gold lining I was on a flight once in erm something happened to this lady like she got sick or whatever but I couldn't quite see but it was like in front of me and em that thing happens which always happens in cartoons where the like air hostess goes on the voice on the voice over and she's like is there a doctor on the plane? is there a doctor on the plane?
B	I've been on a plane where that happened
A	I have
D	yeah so then this guy is like er I'm a doctor and like she's like are you? and is like goes over like I couldn't see exactly what was happening but like he like leans over he's like there for a while and then he goes back to his seat and then she goes to is there another doctor on the plane?
D	and some guy is like yeah I'm a doctor it was funny he was able to help
A	yeah I might next time someone asks that like me
D	are there any more doctors on the plane?
A	doctor of philosophy
D	yeah
B	did you did you see that Derren Brown when he like there was this guy that was terrified of flying and he like it was over a really long period of time and then he like hypnotised him and then he got on the plane and they faked like an emergency on the plane and they hypnotised him not to knocked him out and put him in a flight simulator and he had to like land the plane it was really amazing like so they like hypnotised him and then like they're like we need someone to like
D	and then he wasn't scared of flying any more?
B	but apparently like he didn't it wasn't to do with like to overcome his fear of flying
A	probably just make it worse
B	it was just like a TV show
D	that's crazy
B	have you ever thought you were going to die on a plane?
D	no er a couple of times I've been like er you can you know when it gets like
B	I've been yeah
D	I've never like really thought it though
B	I've got like shit scared where it's just like dropped and like turbulence I've just been like fuck
A	my brother's too scared to go on planes
D	ah
A	there's another story about erm when Justin Bieber took his private jet to the Super Bowl his pilots had to get their oxygen masks to come down cos of the when they were flying so they could weed smoke on the plane
B	JB JB
A	now now he can drink legally it's gonna be crazy
D	when can you drink legally in
A	like I can drink in
A	I'd forgotten it
D	my friend just looked at me like what? are you fucking kidding me? how old is he?
A	but the funny thing about that is actually forgot it after all that and when I went downstairs to the

A	I'll find out if you do the bet
D	no
A	we got on a train at twelve thirty-seven to
D	I've got no reason to think that there's like to strongly believe that we're not going to

B	people are really into fashion
D	you're well you're wilfully surrounding yourself by them
B	by them? oh
D	by them
B	not wilfully I just need to have a job oh god it's so it's like the most boring shit in the world
D	obviously and it's retarded
B	everyone's really thick
D	and they really really care about nothing
D	I mean they do
B	I think it's just cos it's it's really easy
D	some of the most like highly strung intense and angry people I've ever met it's like you're talking about nothing
B	that's the thing it's really easy to talk about oh my god did you see that and it's like yeah it's amazing it's so cute and you're just like and they get to like speak any like all you can talk about is like an understanding of why they did something you're like that's like that because of that but there's no like there's nothing deeper than that obviously there's like massive like cultural social shit addressed but they never obviously engage with that
D	yeah yeah
B	like did you see that Celine thing yeah it's like that Alexander Mcqueen thing last yeah
D	yeah but did you see Madonna fall over?
B	I met the girls that pulled her cape off
D	no way? what happened to them?
B	apparently she was just totally chill about it she was like oh don't worry
D	no way
B	yeah cos we were doing this film with these like
D	that's not what I read
A	what happened to them?
B	no we're doing this film with like these like Japanese lesbian couple that are like they like they're like voguers and they Madonna recruited them and cos they were over here they were over here doing that and then we like
D	that's who pulled the cape?
B	well they were part of the crew of dancers and literally they just

B	apparently she was just like it happens
D	wow Madonna zen it's all like Kabbalah innit?
B	yeah it was really funny I was hanging out the other day they came to like say hello at the office
D	mm
B	and there's like one that's like the dominant one and then this other one because they're like Japanese everything is like so over the top so the dominant one like literally looks like a like erm what's it called? like a
D	S and M
B	like an S and M like mistress or like a maid or whatever like a dominatrix
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and the undominant one like had a teddy bear

B	there's like quite a thing like there's a lot of like older
D	makes them tea?

D	yeah man they're crazy
B	have you seen those like robots
B	yeah and then they drive a long side it in their cars and they've got a remote control that like controls the whip
A	it's alright it'll be worth it when we get there
D	I dunno why am I so tired
A	we're in
B	I'm massively tired I stayed up until like four in the morning watching Has Beens
D	I couldn't sleep either oh yeah what's happening with that website now anyway? where are we up to?
B	the website? well we have to decide what to do with the
D	that page
B	that page cos I it's just gonna look retarded if you've got a page that shows like there's like not one single good photo of Camp Bestival
D	it can just be text that one though
B	I just don't know I mean it won't be a lot to do
D	just do it just do whatever even if it looks shit it's just like it's driving me nuts now
B	it's just opened a whole can of like demanding worms
D	I wish I haven't like let him give feedback in the first place cos now it's like it's his project and I'm like he's telling me whether it's right or not it's like if you wanted to do it you should have just done it from the start it's just like
B	erm but I I'm going to get up early tomorrow and like do like three page designs for that page cos it doesn't to make it's not going to take anything more just to be like click to this click to this but erm that's why I was just like maybe we just keep it as it is so it can get built but
D	I told him that too but he's being
A	get things done
D	mm
B	erm but
D	erm I was just asking about that thing about the
B	about the form?
D	form which seems fine it's just going to go the Gmail and then a spreadsheet or something
B	cos all of that shit's built anyway but they're not having to rebuild that it's all it's all
D	yeah it's fine
B	but yeah I'll send you some options for that in the morning and if they
D	can't they get going with what you've got while you do that page?
B	erm
D	cos if it's going to be three days we'll just give them everything that's been signed off
B	yeah cos what did
D	it's going to be three four days' work and like if it's just the working with us page or whatever can't we just like while we're going it
B	yeah I I'll speak to
D	get on with that other shit
B	yeah
D	cos it I I'm scared that it won't be three days it'll be like three weeks
B	yeah
D	well
B	but yeah I'll speak to
D	I don't know what to do about my site should I still get
B	well it's
D	cos you've done the design but like nothing else has been done on that so like
B	well the guy
D	cos I could just get someone else to do but but I don't know what to do
B	let me see where it's at? because I think it's like half built it's just like it's just got to be like touched up you know? it's just like it's built but it's just like
D	really? I thought nothing had been done on it
B	no it's like built to you know it's like you build the framework and then it's just like going back through the code cos you like the way you do it is like you build it and write all the code or whatever and then you'd be like oh that bit doesn't swirl properly you've got to like you know it's like a process of like fixing as opposed to like
D	yeah
B	so I think like that's done and it's just about like working out the bits so it's like yeah it's probably at a stage where you can just get someone else to look at that or but I feel like if we get someone else to work it out it'll just take longer
D	yeah
B	you know and it they'll be like well that's gonna cost
B	did and like I can't wait to be able to lose my shit on him he's
D	where did you meet him?
B	you know my friend
A	how do you how do you find them?
B	no but it's like I've known him for years
D	he always struck me as a pothead
B	yeah he's like he totally is and he's like I told you he like made loads of money buying shit for
D	what happened to those?
B	well it's since transpired that actually his friend this guy's
D	yeah
B	you know it's like if you're that like you become a project manager and you're like really good at overseeing stuff and getting like this is the timeline this is
D	cos what he really did or what really happened to the whole thing is that it was really badly project managed
B	yeah
D	I mean that's like what went wrong basically like he just wasn't upfront about things
B	yeah yeah because
D	didn't really run with it
B	yeah and it's just like even stuff it's like I'm like yo have you sent that email? he's like oh didn't forgot to press reply or and it's just like are you fucking retarded? like
D	yeah too stoned
B	but but also there's just too
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	but actually that would have been well easier if at the beginning we were just like okay guys what do you want?
D	yeah but I didn't know he was going to suddenly like have a really really really strong idea about exactly what it is and to be honest I haven't even been looking at what he's been saying I've just been going yeah yeah fine make you happy but it's
B	I don't know
B	no but half the shit as well the thing that's really annoying is like when people propose stuff like maybe this will be a good idea and just be like I want this I want his and that kind of shit you can't be like oh maybe I want this and it's like actually no I want this and
D	yeah yeah yeah I know well I
B	but again that's like
D	I told I was constantly saying do you have all the content you need from us? and he'd be like oh I need this one thing and that's it and I'd get him the thing and then he'd be like you know but like I was asking that all the time
B	that's what I mean like that's why I was trying to be like look like if you
D	and now I'm like where is it? he hasn't even saved all the stuff I sent him I have to get it again
B	yeah but that's what I'm saying it's like but also it's like if that is the case you just be like look this is a stage we don't move on to that stage until this stage is complete rather than be like hey we have a bit coming in and cos then you're always like it's basically just not committing to something and just being like yeah we'll we'll like make it through like like we've always got an excuse you know it's always like a bit like yeah well we didn't do this because he didn't do that
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and like de de it's like it doesn't matter if you need that to do that
D	should have got it
B	get it
D	oh man
B	it's just fucking tedious process
D	anyway what are we going to do to
B	well one the thing is I don't want to say anything to him until the site's done until we figure out what's happening with yours
D	yeah
B	and then like
D	you should get it
B	erm but I just I just don't I want to keep him sweet until we get what we need out of him before we torture him
D	break his legs take away his weed take away his like Netflix subscription and like delete all the pizza delivery numbers from his phone
B	ruin him
A	what's the
B	he he's just
D	some reason and I don't know why whenever I do stuff for YBFs it goes wrong I'm not I'm good at stuff like you know if I say I'm going to do something I do it like and I do it well like on my own stuff it's like fine I think it's happened before like I did a photo shoot and I got a friend and like somebody who was like I really thought was going to be great and he just did like an awful job
B	really?
D	we can never use the photos so for some reason I just things go wrong when I do it for anyone else apart from me almost like
A	maybe cos you get your friends to do it
D	no like no more than I do in normal thing and like this guy was like it's like somebody
B	yeah
D	but also to an extent maybe that's like not being used to working with other people who have opinions any more cos like if it's my thing I just do it I know if it's right if I'm trying to please somebody else and like guess what they want then it's like
B	that's the thing is that you're constantly second guessing
D	yeah
B	but it's the
D	yeah
B	understand what he wanted to be the what he wanted me to deliver to him to deliver to the client rather than him just being like you guy you can speak to the client and then I know what they delivered so it's like I was second guessing what he wants or am I doing something that the client wants
D	yeah
B	cos I know what he's asked for they're not going to want to so it's like
D	right yeah that's it er but now I feel like
B	but that's the thing it's like as soon as you give people like the ability to exercise
D	yeah yeah and I only did that
B	that they like they take
D	because I like felt guilty cos we missed the deadline and I and I had vouched for it and like it's fine leave it with me
B	because actually it's the easiest thing to be able to go through something and be like no that needs to be like this and this needs to be like that like
D	crossing the things out and then I actually looked at what he'd written and I wrote to him I was like
A	what was it?
D	ah I don't want to say it out loud man it's just like this like awful like matey language like trying to be your mate yeah
B	trying to be your friend
D	trying to be your friend
A	back of an Innocent smoothie
D	yeah like Innocent smoothie
B	I still think that like no age hashtag no age limit is the funniest shit in the world
D	that's not on there though
D	where?
B	I don't know
B	it's like hashtag no age limits but also to make that like your Twitter handle it's like
D	it's not a Twitter handle
B	it's not a Twitter handle but it's a Twitter hashtag that would for a while it was on the end of everything hashtag no age limit
D	that's probably me writing that to be honest
D	well if you search YMF you get you're my fabulous that's what that means
A	we're allowed to
D	I mean
B	the darker shit MIA if you search MIA it's like something erm anorexic
D	M I A?
B	yeah like it's some like anorexia thing so dark like you look it up and there's like a picture of MIA and some fucking neon on and then just like girls like self harming and like
D	does MIA mean something?
B	don't know like you know there's like that whole like pro ana stuff as well?
D	well that was a
A	is that what you you're just getting used to doing it
B	what?
A	like when you're a teenager you can go to a park
B	go to a park yeah
D	go to a park

B	and playing World of Warcraft
D	it's like research it's like a research position mostly I don't know he he took it begrudgingly as part time it's just for money I think really like parts of it are fairly interesting and I think he has lot of like freedom and control you know and like no one like telling him what to do and like
B	turn the whole thing into a big ball park
D	yeah ball pit
B	ball pit

D	ah bless them that's really that's the end of the story it was just weird
B	it just went
D	yeah it just went and then I and then I all went like pretty quickly and then I had a wristband we went really early to get the wristband and when we got it we just left and I like kicked a door cos there was just like people queuing up for ages to get this ticket and I just picked one kid and gave him my thingy he looked like he wanted to marry me
A	probably the first time he's talked to a girl
D	yeah and I gave him my wristband for Warcraft like picked him out of a crowd of dweebs
