A	okay right right it is
B	but it's hers is really long it's like down to here
C	but you've got the same colour like I

C	she was like a replica of you
B	ah
C	almost
C	cos you look very similar you do
B	I don't think we look similar at all
A	some are really easy and then some are really hard
B	then I suppose like as sisters we do look a little bit more similar
A	twenty-four percent of people could do this
C	oh yeah you look similar
B	yeah like cos my mum looks nothing like her two sisters
B	eh? do you think you look like your sister?
C	erm
B	mm
C	like some people say we look like twins but I don't
C	but then some people say we look nothing alike so
B	mm
C	it I think it's just little bits of us are like in each other I think that's like with everyone
B	yeah
C	cos you get some sisters and siblings who just look exactly the same
B	yeah I think
A	I don't know what that is
B	she's gonna phone me back in a minute

unknown_female	there's
D	how far can you run?

A	it's er it's a
D	why don't
C	go with
A	even cone?
D	dunno how they do it
B	at first but you could eventually
C	I could eventually be the next
A	I don't think so
C	Mo Farah
A	like he really really really like
C	I don't care I'm as good as
C	oh
D	he
C	he's doing the triathlon isn't he?

C	mm
unknown_female	that's
C	cycling then more running
A	a stupid amount of pasta I've put in this pan
C	like why would you put yourself through that? I don't understand
A	I mean why would you run just for for your own pleasure? I just don't understand
C	I like the thing is I quite like like running and walking
C	and stuff like it makes me feel good but
A	yeah
C	I I wouldn't want to
A	no I get that I just
unknown_female	yeah
A	wouldn't do it myself
C	I like the fresh air I think that's what I like
unknown_female	yeah
C	like I like having like people always complain about the wind but I love it like I love going outside and having wind in my hair and on my face and feeling like I'm in like cos I dunno where I live is just kind of quite like this in a way like cos it's so like weathery I I kind of like it
A	mm
C	mm cos it's so like you feel very
A	I don't like being
B	mm
A	sweaty
B	what you'd run in this?
C	no I wouldn't run in this
unknown_female	I
A	I don't like being sweaty I like skiing cos you're cold and I like swimming in the wet
B	but skiing makes you sweat like hell
A	not if it's cold enough
B	mm
C	but you oh yeah to be fair
B	yeah cos when I went skiing it wasn't even snowing it was like really warm it we were actually like sunbathing one day it was that hot
A	you can do that particularly if you're
B	yeah
A	if you're at the bottom of a mountain but where we were the summit was four thousand metres
B	mm
C	oh my gosh
A	and it was like minus thirty
B	yeah I mean we went on the ski lift and it was snowing up there it was so scary cos I was on the lift with like one other person that I didn't really know and it suddenly just went white and we couldn't see
C	wow
A	mm
B	a thing and it was so
A	I I have
B	scary
A	I have been in in like
unknown_female	oh
A	er where the visibility is like you actually cannot see the car in front of you
B	yeah yeah
A	and you can't
B	you can't see it
A	see the one behind you so there's just a string
B	it's so horrible
A	and you are like on this chair
B	yeah
A	the worst one was when it was so cold that the bar that's meant to come over was frozen to the back of the seat and
B	shit
A	like one slip and you're like
B	mm
A	you fall you die so we just held on to the back of the thing and just waited for it to be over
B	well this was like
C	oh my god
B	our last day and so they kind of expected us to be able to know what we were doing and then we got off this lift we could not see a thing in front of us and we just like had to just trust like I don't know the skis that were on our legs like we were just
C	oh my god
B	it
B	I was like can you just stop please? like
C	oh fucking hell
B	and then we had to like ski down this mountain that we couldn't see in front of us like it was just
C	mm
A	yeah
B	like the snow was just
A	skiing with poor visibility is like
B	it was so scary
A	shit
B	I will not forget it oh it was horrible
C	wow
B	and that was the last day finally
C	I once went to for a school trip it was a dry ski slope
A	mm
B	yeah
A	they're so shit
C	they were
A	I really hurt myself
C	I didn't really know how to do it cos I'd never been skiing before
A	yeah
C	so I kind of put my boots on and like tried to climb it the side of it but I didn't realise that you kind of you know when er
D	okay
C	that kind of yeah yeah
unknown_female	yeah
C	like you would an escalator I was like
A	oh yeah the funny the lift thing
C	walk up?
A	I remember those
C	yeah
A	yeah I got erm I got stuck on that cos it went too fast and then I like fell over and it whacked me in the head
C	it's horrible
unknown_female	that
C	and I was like
C	falling down
C	yeah
A	I'm not good at sports at all I should never ever do sport ever again
B	I've never been like oh er the first time I went skiing in artificial snow was when we went somewhere with the school and it was like the summit was like two thousand metres
C	mm
B	and it was March so there was like a great deal of there was no real snow so they had to put it on artificial and I hated cos er when it rained it goes sticky
C	oh gosh
B	so yeah
unknown_female	yeah
B	and it rained cos it was fucking March it wasn't winter anymore
C	oh my gosh
B	and like my
unknown_female	yeah
B	there will not be real snow like it's just
A	where did you go like?
B	some place in France
A	oh yeah
B	but we had to drive there like it was er on a coach it was eighteen hours
A	oh yeah
C	wow
A	yeah we drove to the Alps and it took like so long cos we broke down like halfway through the mountain and erm and the air conditioning broke as well
B	cos the whole place like it's really like it's really bendy and winding cos you have to go up mountains and you just feel really car sick
A	yeah
C	oh gosh
A	it was pretty horrible
B	yeah I don't really think that skiing's my thing
C	I don't like
B	oh I hate sport
C	like I I used to hate sport when I was younger cos I used to think I was just rubbish at it but
B	mm
C	when I got er into like into my teenage years I kind of liked it more because it I think what put me off it was PE at school but once
A	yeah
C	P like it's like oh yeah yeah you don't have to do it like this you can like go and
B	what did you like doing?
C	erm like badminton tennis
B	yeah
C	running
C	where I am cos there's loads of hills and stuff
B	yeah
C	like so I used to do like two hour walks at home and all that
C	yeah like but serious like uphill walking so it was like it doesn't sound much but like your your legs really hurt
A	yeah no well I've been I've been hiking before that's awful
D	er er
C	yeah yeah definitely
A	I always liked sports where there was like adrenalin cos I absolutely hated exercise but I liked
C	yeah
C	the
A	so I liked skiing and I liked horse riding cos you just sat down and the other one
A	you just slid downhill so you just went
C	yeah
A	and you're like oh my god my god this is so
B	yeah but skiing is like really like
A	yeah
B	hurts it's not like
A	yeah that is true
C	oh skiing hurts
B	it's not like you're just chilling out
B	yeah
A	I like adrenalin so
D	what if the horses kick you off?
A	mm? well then you fall and then you get back on again
C	that's the thing about I think that's why I'm so scared
D	get on again
C	of erm being on a horse it's because like at least say if you're ice skating you kind of have control of your legs
A	but you can control where
C	of course you have
A	it throws you off the thing yeah
C	yeah
A	you don't like
D	yeah
A	the fall
C	yeah
D	but then you when you
C	no
D	go skiing you go oh you go downhill
C	because apparently when you're horse riding it doesn't matter how good like of like of a horse rider you are like it's just natural that a the horse will chuck you off sometimes that's fine and then you just go flying and it's just like I couldn't cope with that I'm sorry
A	erm
C	like I've just seen like alright
C	oh right okay
A	in France erm because a tractor was out and a horse just didn't like tractors so it almost threw me off but er
C	oh my god
A	luckily my instructor was there and she managed to calm down the
D	are you alright?
A	I didn't really
A	so it wouldn't fly off erm and like go everywhere like er but it's fine
C	oh
A	that's a quite a lot of sauce she said pouring more sauce in
C	the more the merrier
A	okay I just
C	I think I'm getting used to
A	mm
C	in a way you're like mm
A	mm
C	mm
C	you're like mm thinking
D	it's
C	of
D	just getting harder for me
C	is it getting harder?
D	yeah
C	what course wise or living at uni or just er?
D	course wise
C	course wise
C	jesus christ could have ended up with worse
D	yeah I'm actually happy about the house I mean the flat
C	yeah yeah me too
D	in terms of
C	yeah
D	we all know you aren't happy cos of your view
A	yeah my shit view
C	I've got a shit view cos everyone can see if you come into my room everyone can see me like that comes down that road
A	yeah no same cos er
C	yeah
A	I think we have the same view actually I think we've both got that main road in front of us
C	yeah yeah so when like sometimes I just pop out the shower because I forget to to close my curtains when I'm you know getting dressed I'm like uhu
C	somebody can see me
A	yeah I just don't have that problem cos I literally never open my curtains
C	oh right okay
D	I just see the flower that's all I see
A	yeah
C	you
D	cos when you walk down it's literally right in front of you
C	mm
D	it's basically right in front of you
C	mm
D	but
A	okay oh I'm so excited to eat this
C	what did you make?
A	oh just
C	pasta?
A	yeah just some pasta and some sauce
C	oh I'm so tired now
A	mm
C	I guess cos I
A	I get really bored
C	yeah I do get bored and I end up doing really non productive stuff
A	mm
C	so
D	I just
C	yeah yeah yeah same
D	I will like it would be even
C	isn't it really scary when you wake up on the morning like when your alarm goes off and then you go you close your eyes for literally I'm not even gonna say
D	yeah
C	it feels like for one minute cos it is?
C	it feels like one minute in your head
D	yeah and you wake up an hour later
C	and then I woke up forty-five minutes later and I was like
D	yeah like
C	what the fuck? have we
A	and it doesn't even like you've like gained anything from that extra bit of sleep like you don't feel like
C	yeah
A	any more ready to take on the day
C	you're just like maybe it'll help but no
D	when
C	mm
D	and no light out or
C	I know
B	yeah that's so shit like every morning I wake up and I just like dread looking at my phone to see what time it is cos it's usually between like twelve and three o'clock in the afternoon
C	I know
B	it makes me think oh god
C	oh
B	how bad is it today? cos my my alarm just does not work anymore I don't know what it is I've changed it and I've got like eight separate alarms on like
C	we need to buy you like
B	it just doesn't work
C	an insanely loud alarm

A	an obnoxious alarm
B	we need to like hire a drummer
C	I think you can probably get like ones for extreme sleepers like
B	there must it's
C	one that sounds like
C	yeah
B	like cos it used to wake me up like when I had to get up for college my alarm would just wake me up at seven o'clock in the morning and every time I would get up
C	but do you literally not
B	I just don't
C	hear it anymore?

D	what's it called?
B	old car horn it's on the classic ones
C	that can't be the loudest
D	it's the
B	it doesn't sound very loud on here but it is really loud
C	you go on settings I think
B	I'm so bad at this fricking thing

B	yeah
A	by the seaside
B	look the volume is hundred percent
D	how do you wake up to that?

B	it's just I don't know why it's not very loud
D	wait a minute
A	that's normally that's my normal ring for the
C	that one
D	yeah I know
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	why is yours so much louder than mine? I don't understand this
C	hang on let me have a look right
B	that's the ringer volume though
C	but it will go yeah but it goes that loud it's louder
B	a little bit
C	a little bit
B	that's my phone that's my ring tone on there
D	I think it's you need to go to Apple
B	like that's what I usually have and that should wake me up
C	that should
B	that's loud enough
C	that sounds loud enough now
B	it is and that's like repeated as well
A	get a dock and then have the dock like amplify
B	a what? oh a dock
A	yeah
C	you've got one haven't you?
B	I know it doesn't work like I dunno how to
C	oh
B	fix it it's really annoying
B	I just think that's the loudest one
C	that
A	you should get an actual alarm clock
B	that's quite loud
A	you could get an actual alarm clock a proper one
B	yeah I could do
C	yeah you
D	I went shopping last week when I didn't have my charger
A	mm
D	it was so bad
C	that you
B	that might work
C	use that I think you should use that
A	I still think you should pick a really irritating song
D	that's loud that's that is very loud
B	yeah
C	oh my god do Aeroplanes by BOB
C	cool
B	I used to like that song okay?
C	I know
B	I still think that's the most offensive one
C	well do an inviting one
B	yeah
C	or Guacamole
B	oh crickets? that's pretty irritating
B	oh god that one
C	what are you scared of?
B	spiders
C	spider crawling or something like that
C	no
D	spiders and snakes
B	there isn't any noise for that
C	we need to get you up in the morning we need to find a suitable alarm
B	I know
C	erm what else is there?
A	I still think you should just get a proper alarm
C	yeah you should
A	really really loud
B	oh you could use songs I didn't know that that's good
C	maybe this isn't is there an app for the alarm that you can get that maybe is like really like
B	I don't know maybe
C	designed to wake you up?
B	I'll have a look
D	probably
A	super loud alarm and
C	mm super loud alarm or super annoying alarms or
B	mm
C	impossible to sleep through cos it would save you money
B	yeah
C	cos you don't wanna have to buy a really expensive alarm clock
A	I don't think it's expensive to get a loud one
D	about
C	yeah
D	about five pounds really
B	and that's not expensive to you?
D	five pound for an alarm clock?
B	oh I thought you said forty-five pounds
D	no
B	bloody hell I was gonna say
C	we should pull that
A	we could just wake you up
B	I'm just gonna find an app and see if that's
A	I'll just wake you up when I wake up
B	yeah it doesn't work though
B	cos you just like all you can do is knock on the door cos I lock my door when I go to bed
A	mm
C	yeah
B	so
C	to be fair yeah I have tried a few times but you were asleep
B	but then I just yeah I just don't wake up to it
C	cos
B	cos I can't wake up to
C	yeah
B	a knock on the door it's not enough it's really bad
A	maybe I could set off the disabled alarm
B	I might just
C	that's what I was thinking
B	that's what we did to
C	to try and wake you up yeah
B	but it was yeah we could do that there's one in my room so it would make a noise but I don't know if the one in here would affect the one in my room
A	it's was so loud it it got everyone like
B	oh yeah
D	oh I wasn't
B	what like what songs?
C	mm
B	like just songs are bad for like being annoying and loud
A	Friday?
B	Friday
B	I could get some like awful heavy metal and just put it on my phone and wake up to that
C	oh Skrillex
A	oh oh oh no tap in Babymetal tap in Babymetal
B	oh I've heard of Babymetal but they're kind of cool though I quite like that one
A	but it would be really awful to wake up to
C	do that rolling what's it Rolling in the Deep the Adele or Someone Like You the reggae version
B	erm Babymetal shut up
C	is that
B	yeah
B	she's annoyed
C	what what's she said?
B	I don't know she's saying
A	oh is this your sister?
B	yeah
C	what are you gonna do?
B	in a minute
A	eh?
D	you were saying it was too
A	I'm gonna take some out afterwards

B	yeah
D	did you melt the cheese or just put it in?
B	Justin Bieber like a horrible old song of his or something
A	Baby
B	I think he was like fourteen
C	oh was he fourteen? okay everyone used to really well people still really like him don't they?
B	I genuinely thought I had it and cos it was advertised on like songs to wake you up
A	did you see
B	and I heard it in the background and I did actually think it was a girl
A	Wake Me Up Before You Go
B	oh yes
C	yes
B	that would be amazing like full blast
A	no it's not loud enough
B	I don't know what my phone what's wrong with my phone I think maybe the
A	yeah
B	cos that is literally how loud it goes this is full volume right now
B	or Green Day's Wake Me Up When September Ends

C	how about
B	Evanescence
C	Bring Me to Life
C	that would be a great wake up song
B	yeah it would
B	yeah just a bit
C	erm I'm trying to think of other ones how about that Rick Astley one?
B	yes I was just thinking that Never Gonna Give You Up would be
B	cos it's just like so recognisable and you're just oh for fuck's sake this again
C	how about Meghan Trainor?
B	oh
A	oh
B	I don't think I could cope with that
B	cos I don't wanna buy anything and then have to pay them for it

B	no it's not student it's just Apple Music like when they launched they did a three month trial for six months for everyone
C	oh god okay that's quite
B	oh no it's not six months it's three months I'm thinking

B	I really need something that I could get
B	shush
A	do something like the Ketchup song
B	god
C	that was like the party song
B	no I think I might do Rick Astley I think that's quite a good idea
C	yeah I'd do Rick Astley
A	you need something that has
A	kind of an annoying intro though cos you'll never get
B	well that does
A	really?
C	yes
B	that will wake me up I think
C	if that doesn't wake you up
C	maybe it's the alarms
C	or something that's got a problem
B	I think it just doesn't sound very loud does it? like compared to yours
C	if you go on have you been on your settings to check your
B	yeah
C	your er?

B	it's on max
A	yeah
B	is that a 6S? that looks really big
A	it's a 6S but it's not the
C	not the plus yeah

A	yeah
B	oh god there's 6S plus now oh
A	yeah but S is just er
B	oh for Siri cool cool
C	you couldn't even have the pluses like
unknown_female	yeah

C	have you got bad eyesight?
B	yeah
C	erm long sighted is you see things far away but not close up like so if you

unknown_female	everyone is trying to find the
C	where is it?
C	oh here we go
B	excellent shut up now I don't want it to play it okay

B	they've all got a
A	literally oh my god
C	oh my god
B	cos I probably wouldn't wake up then anyway
A	why do you have so many alarms?
B	I don't know cos I stress out and I'm like have to wake up at a certain time
A	I
B	I don't know why there are there though
B	oh this is cos the other day I had a nap and had to wake up then

B	or like Skrillex or something
C	oh
B	like a Skrillex song how does it go again? I can't remember
C	I remember there was a phase when everyone in my school was obsessed with Skrillex
B	yeah
A	he has a funniest squeaking voice I've ever heard in my life
C	really? what's it like?
A	he sounds like a girl he goes you ready? like that only
C	what when he's talking?
A	yeah yeah
B	what's that one song though on there that's like Skrillex?
A	Bangarang? is that it?

C	I sat with the cool kids who smoked but I didn't smoke because I was too hard core not to smoke
B	yeah I never smoked at school
C	yeah
B	it was weird like everyone else did
C	I once smoked paper when I was in year seven
C	and thought it was I was so cool but
B	I didn't smoke
C	but
B	cos my dad smoked and I always said that
C	yeah that's why
B	I'd never smoke because my dad smokes
C	that's exactly why I didn't smoke
B	I didn't even do it when I was drunk and a couple of years later and
C	is it nice? do you enjoy it?
B	no it's not I hate it

B	so you have to dress up
C	in Goblet of Fire you know the rock band? it's like
B	the one about the weird sisters or something like that
A	be like a crazy elf
B	elf
A	that's like the worst lyrics
unknown_female	oh
C	it was so good
A	it was so awful
C	it was awful but it was amazing
A	it was like Jarvis Cocker or something in the film wasn't it? like he had a cameo in the film
C	yeah that song's called Do the Hippogriff
B	oh god yeah
B	it used to be
C	do the like
B	they could just like play the Harry Potter theme and we can just do that like
B	or like er make a dubstep version
C	oh god
B	they have made a dubstep version I've heard it
C	oh have they?
B	it's bad
C	is it good?
B	it is bad
C	oh it's bad okay
B	yeah it's not good
C	or they could do like imagine yes you could you could just act out the whole of Harry Potter
B	yeah
C	do you know what would be really good I think
C	like do the whole Les Mis in a club cos it's like three hours long
C	yeah
C	everyone just dances to that and gets absolutely drunk
C	what? Les Mis?
C	oh west end?
B	like Russell Crowe like all the time
C	yeah yeah
B	it's a great film
unknown_female	er
C	it's really cool
B	my friend's mum got group tickets like a group of eight so we got seats that were originally seventy pounds for four thirty
C	when did you go and see it?
B	in the summer
C	who did you see as Eponine?
B	erm Carrie Fletcher
C	did you?
B	yeah
C	was she good?
B	yeah she was really good
C	oh my
C	I was thinking did you see Carrie in it? yeah
B	yeah this is what they wrote when they changed the night of the Harry Potter theme it's so nerdy
B	oh my god
D	you're a big fan
B	yeah
D	you should get your ticket then if you want because er
B	I know I'm I need to but I don't wanna go out in the rain so I think they probably will
C	that's so good
C	that's so cool
D	I think I think they're only selling it until I've seen some
B	yeah but it's
D	oh so you can still go?
B	you can still go yeah
D	it's not really yeah
B	a capacity thing
D	it's not really a free entry if you have to pay for a scarf
B	yeah
C	mm
B	exactly
A	I'm sure there's a place you could do it
B	I would ace it
C	they're actually introducing that I think in America
A	mm
C	or somewhere
B	of course they are
C	no I'm I'm not joking honestly
B	yeah no I know
C	they're doing it they're doing they're doing it
B	like of course they are only America like would do that
C	what do you think all the degrees
B	erm
C	mm
B	you know the trans awareness and all that stuff going on
C	we actually do that in gender women's studies
B	oh do you?
C	so yeah we do
B	that's good
C	intersectionality
B	mm
C	we do class like how gender basically relates to like
B	yeah
C	race class sexuality and then we do body image body awareness then we do
B	that's
C	yeah
B	everything else seems to be covered
C	mm
B	although I do think they should make more degrees
C	I think it feels like everything's covered but I guess if you looked at it properly
B	yeah
C	I don't think you would think that like
B	mm
C	I'm trying to think what they'd do erm
B	mm
C	you can just like
A	I feel a lot of the things are like you don't need generally a degree to do them
C	mm
A	I dunno like
C	there's yeah
A	you can have a degree in stuff like circus studies I mean what are you gonna learn in a lecture about circus studies?
unknown_female	well you just
A	you just go to a fucking circus get on the road like
A	like it doesn't seem like a think that needs a degree like just practice
B	have you seen in the news that erm universities are gonna start charging extra fees for how good the university teaching is?
C	really?
B	like if they can prove
C	when is that gonna happen?
B	probably like in the next couple of years they reckon
C	so when we've left?
B	well hopefully yeah
B	just about yeah
C	that's like America then
B	but it's so what they would I know
C	all over again
B	so what they're gonna do is like assess how well they are how good the teaching is at a certain university and based on that they're gonna charge more for fees
C	really?
B	which is just ridiculous cos they shouldn't be charging anything for fees anyway like it should be free education should be free
C	so
B	full stop you know
C	I'm assuming that won't mean that going to like a lower university they're not gonna lower it for lower universities gonna raise it for higher ones?
B	yeah so they won't take away any money from the lower ones I don't think
C	that's crazy
B	yeah
C	like how much more can they charge?
C	is that like is there gonna be a big difference?
B	I don't know I don't know but it's a tory government and like I don't even know like
C	and it's five more years of this
B	yes I know
C	fucking hell
B	I know and they're also and it's funny
C	yeah yeah
B	but also like that's more pressure on the students
C	mm
B	yeah so they're gonna do more of an American style like grading like having er like termly progress for students like
C	but then
C	well that's
B	how they do it in America
C	bullshit because what you said about the thingamajig it's gonna be the richest kids going to the top universities
B	yeah
C	not the
B	yeah
C	so I thought that was the point of university like
B	well
C	equal
B	yeah exactly
C	like equality for all where everyone go but no apparently not
B	well I mean I expect there'll still have scholarships and stuff but it's just gonna get
C	but not everyone
B	no
C	can get a scholarship
B	yeah exactly
C	very few
B	it's just gonna be a lot harder to get yeah like less people who aren't necessarily really intelligent will be able to go to the top universities because they won't be able to afford it
C	mm
B	like
C	life is just not fair is it?
B	it really isn't
C	what what did it say?
B	it was like Matrix style like we're all just like following rules in this massive big system
C	was that the is that the one with the big voiceover?
B	it's yeah
C	I've
B	suddenly
C	yeah I've seen that
B	cropped up again but
C	it's like we're living to work our lives away
B	yeah
C	that one? yeah
B	yeah literally
B	it just makes you feeling more depressed rather than like wanting to change something and just like oh for fuck's sake
C	it's like we're living in a world by
B	yeah
C	by
B	but the bit about destroying and the earth was really sad
C	it was like in the last fifty years we've destroyed I can't remember what it was it's like seventy-five percent of the world's rain forests or something
B	yeah
C	it's that's really sad like
B	mm
C	humanity is quite scary actually
B	yeah
C	what we're capable of
B	I mean we think we're so intelligent but we're really not
C	we think we're superior we've got a superior
unknown_female	yeah
C	complex
B	mm
C	it was talking about how like how humans are different to animals it's not necessarily that we're more intelligent than other animals it's because we believe we're better than other animals
B	yeah
C	and that's what's unique about humans basically that we just think yeah
A	I'm sure other animals think they're more superior than us
C	no no but we feel like we're superior to all the animals like we believe we own all the animals we believe that we should like have all the animals kind of thing rather than like yeah
B	mm yeah
C	cos imagine a society where humans and animals were equal
B	mm
C	that would be strange
B	well I think we'd all be vegetarians
C	yes we would join
A	apart from if it was the last
B	vegans we'd all be vegans
C	vegans
A	well
C	yeah
B	yeah you would
A	I wouldn't eat hamster I don't think hamster would taste very nice
C	I thought you were going to say oh I'm not that mean I wouldn't eat a hamster but no a hamster
C	doesn't taste very nice
A	well it's a little squiggly thing like why would you wanna eat that?
C	that's fluffy and yeah
A	there's probably no meat on it
C	it's I I don't know it's quite like burger sized isn't it? like it's
A	yeah if you look yeah but if you look at the size of the animal and the size of meat you can get from it it's like it's
C	oh
A	that kind of stuff you'd probably just eat like the tummy part
B	mm
A	that's not very good
C	yeah
A	sorry I'm grossing you out cos you
C	no no that's fine
C	like
B	why do three Rs what can this mean?
C	wire?
B	oh like that
C	oh no erm
B	erm just think oh this thing okay
C	oh that's you're playing that game again
B	oh god
C	there's a girl that's walking towards us outside in the dark and her hair's really fluffy so she looks like a goat
B	ah

B	you got more tests coming up?
C	well in the next three weeks but like it's gonna be from the start till
B	mm
C	of the year till the end so it'll probably take a while to get through the whole course
B	yeah
C	like you feel like it feels like the exams at uni just never stop
B	yeah it's non stop assessments and non stop this is the first week since we started uni that I haven't had a maths
C	really?
B	assessment yeah
C	that's crazy
