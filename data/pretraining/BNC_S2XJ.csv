C	for a dog yeah like you could get a kid's bed for twenty pounds
B	oh
E	when we went
C	but cots were free
E	when we went camping they charge us for the space on the ground like the plot
A	yeah
E	the tent itself even though it was our tent
A	yeah
E	to put it up
C	and the time
E	so it would be like if it's a two-man tent it'll be a tenner if it's a three-man tent it'll be twelve whatever
A	yeah
E	the car that wasn't using any any er it wasn't like we connected it up or anything
D	with a space
E	er and then to use the toilets

E	yeah and and
B	oh
E	because we didn't know we just turned up there we didn't book or anything
A	each time you use the toilet you've gotta
E	no no
E	we'd have to pay five euros extra because you will be using them throughout the night
A	oh
E	and they had like this they said oh yeah you can use the like hydrotherapy pool then and it's like well so you're paying for that and it's like well I wouldn't have paid for that if
B	oh
E	I had the choice
B	oh that's
E	anyway it was about thirty euros
B	that's a real con
C	yeah it was expensive
E	for the night which you could get a hotel room for
D	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	for the dogs
E	I didn't know that there's a dog box have you seen the dog box? did mum show you the dog box?

C	was a spare lead in there as well did I see?

A	yeah
B	blankets and
D	but that would be nice if you're like she left a welcome biscuit if you're bringing
B	yeah
C	she probably would you know if we had said we were bringing a dog
D	yeah
C	I bet she would
D	yeah
B	well
D	mm
B	so they travelled up in them
D	yeah
B	and then we just put the the basket against the wall there
D	mm
B	and they
D	they're happy

A	but we never leave them alone in the house
B	no
A	in the cottage
D	you take them out with you
B	it's the same with everything and we pay for the people that do
D	yeah

B	no
E	they're not gonna stop people with kids going in
B	I mean you can't have dogs running round when people are eating
C	no
B	to start with it's not safe is it dogs running round? and it's not
C	no
B	not very nice
D	no
B	not everybody likes dogs and nobody likes dogs by food
D	no
B	they're very good
D	under the table fast asleep
B	they are yeah

D	mm
B	and then we go in for a meal and they're happy in the car
D	yeah yeah have a sleep then
B	yeah
C	you were right
D	ah the green
C	yeah
D	more like a
C	but you can see as well
D	more like the upstairs green
C	that bit like the purple is on the tin as well here
D	the purple from your bedroom?
C	yeah
D	oh okay
C	it's very like they're all very distinct colours aren't they? like the teal that's in your room
D	yeah
C	and this kind of green here
D	yeah nice colours
C	yeah
A	is that er teal there?
C	no upstairs in
D	no upstairs
B	it's darker it's darker
D	in our bedroom it's like a
B	there's on there
D	yeah
C	I like teal it's a nice
D	mind you we loved the colours on the duck eggs didn't we?
C	wow they were
D	the duck egg blue
C	and then we finally realised that's why it's duck egg blue
E	the eggs are blue?
C	no like the shell was like erm
E	that's what I'm saying
D	yeah
C	not blue but
D	the duck eggs were blue
C	like a really lovely grey
D	mm
C	we had duck eggs
B	yes I saw them in the basket
C	they're enormous they must be from that big massive chicken
D	yeah
C	have you been to see the chicks?
B	no I don't like chickens
C	the chickens and the ducks
B	I don't like them
C	oh no but they're really funny they've got really good feathers
B	I don't
D	she
C	and they are they've got like these
B	I don't like birds
C	crazy feathers
D	yeah
C	that I've never seen on a chicken before
B	oh
C	and then they've got ducks that have got the biggest hairdo
C	they're definitely worth a visit
B	oh
C	honestly they're not very far
B	I don't like birdy things no
D	good job you didn't see that chicken when it came rushing in here
A	you had one come in here did you?
C	yeah
D	the dogs chased the chickens
A	oh I saw them outside
D	and one came in er in here and
A	oh
A	yeah
D	so
D	while
B	oh
C	any birds?
B	any birds
C	any birds
B	especially when they flap
C	yeah it's cos they look like it's
B	mm
C	cos they know they're not supposed to be there
D	mm
C	so then everybody's all in a flap cos
D	everybody yeah
C	nobody wants them there they don't wanna be there
D	where's our bleeding house?
C	and they can't find their way out
B	is there a cockerel?
C	and it started tapping at the window as well
B	is there a cockerel waking you up?
C	no
D	well there is a cockerel but he hasn't woken
E	there must be normally
D	us up
B	oh
D	has he woken you up
E	no
D	oh
B	well that cockerel opposite us keeps going all day
B	I thought they only did it in the morning when they got up
B	but
A	and does it before it gets light
B	but this er one this one's crowing all day
D	so you two are you fit for a a finale then? or are we just talking about it?
E	I don't mind
B	it's only old men sleep in the afternoon
E	and the Spanish
D	and look how productive they are
B	yeah but you are you are Welsh you are
E	no I've I've gone soft now you know see
C	it is lovely a siesta
D	no I can't do it
B	no no
C	it's very nice
B	I'm not very good at going to sleep if I'm not in bed no
A	do they go to bed early in Spain?
C	no
E	no they get up early and then they will have a siesta for two hours but they wouldn't eat till about ten o'clock at night
E	and then they'll stay out till about twelve o'clock and then probably go home and go straight to bed
C	but they have their main meal of the day is lunchtime
A	is it?
C	so they have a really really big lunch
A	oh
C	like three courses every day
A	oh
C	even at home he'll have three courses
E	and they have snacks as well a lot of elevenses
C	and then that's when you'll fall asleep
B	mm mm
A	oh
B	it used to be in this country didn't it? I don't
D	oh right yeah
B	and then you had tea
D	mm
B	and
E	it's like healthy apparently because
C	yeah
E	if you have if you think you're having your biggest meal and then go to sleep it just sits there doesn't it?
D	yeah
C	yeah they say they er say that you should breakfast like a king lunch like a prince
A	yeah
C	and have dinner
B	yeah
C	like a pauper
E	and their Sundays would be very they would do almost nothing on a Sunday
A	oh
C	except for eat
E	they wouldn't nobody works they will just eat
C	at a family's house
E	so would so they probably charge up for a week on a Sunday whereas I think we're a bit busy on a Sunday
D	mm
E	our day is anyway
C	but they have their siesta mainly because they don't sleep
D	plus it's so hot
C	yeah
D	so they're up early
B	yeah
C	yeah sometimes like when you say siesta like a lot of time they're going to bed for ten minutes twelve minutes
E	forty minutes is the ideal
C	yeah
E	time they reckon
C	but they get about two and a half hours free so it's up to them what they do with it
E	you can fit in a
D	oh
C	if you're clever
D	so do you in school
C	I don't cos I only work at night but schools have siesta time
D	oh
C	schools will close the kids will be out at half past one and then they have to be back for half past three but it's crazy cos then they go back for like an hour and a half
D	yeah
C	like they're almost better off just staying
D	carrying on through
C	and then when it gets to the end
E	yeah but it fits there'll be people working
C	yeah
D	mm
C	but then when it gets to the end of May the kids stay at school until half past one and then that's it
D	oh
C	so it's too hot in the afternoons
D	too hot
C	to be at school
D	yeah
C	but your kids can stay at school they have like lunch clubs cos not
D	yeah
C	and taken by their grandparents cos parents are at work
D	mm
C	but a lot of them will stay at like lunch clubs cos nobody can collect them
D	mm
C	it's quite inconvenient for parents
B	there's a lot of after school
D	yeah
C	to have to be around to pick them up to bring them back to take them back
D	yeah very inconvenient
B	mm
C	yeah cos one of my private classes there's these two girls who get picked up by their like nanny I play with them in English for an hour and do crafts and then they have their lunch and then they go back to school
D	mm
C	so their parents obviously feel like they've got to
D	fill that time
C	fill that big time
D	yeah
C	so I just take Ticket to Ride
D	ah
B	when in some schools here they have breakfast clubs apparently
C	yeah
A	mm
C	they call it wraparound care so that they can go to breakfast club and then they can go to afternoon after school club
B	yeah
C	so you could drop a child off at eight o'clock
A	yeah
C	until six o'clock
A	which if you've got
B	strange isn't it?
C	well I think it's there if you've if you are a working parent if you drop your child off at eight and you've got to be in the office
B	yeah
C	for nine and then you finish at five you can be back to pick up your child
B	that's right but you know you're not giving your children
D	no
B	you're not seeing
C	no
B	each other
D	no
B	they're having these afternoon things
D	mm
C	a lot of the school the one I worked in London they used to try to get as many children as possible in for breakfast club even if they their parents didn't work because they wanted to know that they were starting the day with breakfast
D	with a good meal
B	that was the
C	cos if they yeah
B	yeah
C	they used to say like you can come for free like just come because we want to know you're gonna start the day off with a full tummy and so it makes a difference to their attention for the rest of the day if they're not
B	yeah it does
C	hungry
B	yeah
D	cos you don't know how much they're having at home they could just be having
B	yeah yeah
D	a
B	mm
D	cereal they could just be having rubbish
C	so we had chickens so they used to go and collect the eggs from the chickens
D	ah
C	which was nice for them
D	that was nice
C	and then some of them used to stay after school even though their parents could look after them because they needed the help with the homework and they knew that if they went home no one was helping them at home they would just be sitting in front of the Playstation
D	mm
C	which isn't a bad thing but they would kind of go to our school club just to get a bit of extra help
D	yeah
C	no like extra
D	TAs?
C	TAs
D	mm
C	cos if you get free schools meals you can get a free breakfast club and free after school club
D	oh I see
C	so and a school is judged on its numbers of free school meals that's how they judge a school completely
D	mm
E	what do you mean completely?
C	that's how a school gets its funding it's entirely based on its number of free school meals
E	so not not grades not
C	no in terms of when the government
E	mm
C	they'll go right well this is the standard amount this school has to get because it's got sixty children so it has to have this amount but then they have a thing called pupil premium which then gives as school more money and that's based completely on the number of free school meals cos they think if for every child that needs free school meals then obviously they have to give a bit of extra money because there obviously there's gonna be some
C	kind of extra need that they might
E	mm
C	need to have
C	so then that's why some of your richest schools are actually in the worst areas because they feel that they are the areas that need the extra money to look after the children that possibly aren't getting the at home support and things like that so that's why lots of schools try really hard
D	oh
C	they'll be a bit like are you sure you're not eligible?
D	yeah
C	are you sure you're not eligible?
D	mm
C	cos then they get it's a huge amount of extra money you get
D	oh
C	like thousands and thousands per child
B	these dogs are gonna miss this floor when we go back
E	how come this house is so warm when the fire's not on then? is it just come from the floor?
D	yeah
C	yeah
E	can you switch it off?
D	no
E	you can't switch it off?
D	no
E	but she couldn't even switch it off?
D	no it's just it's on constant constant hot water constant heat
C	but like a
E	must cost loads though
C	a regulated thing and though kind of like
E	it must cost loads
C	does it is it going off in the night?
E	and it makes it too hot as well doesn't it sometimes? it's like in the summer it would make it it would definitely be too hot
D	mm
E	you'd want that floor to be cold in the summer wouldn't you?
C	but maybe it's on like a
D	perhaps it's on a
C	yeah
E	no what I'm saying so she's
D	she said she doesn't understand it the plumber
C	I think she just doesn't want you to start fiddling with
D	er yeah
C	the buttons
D	probably she doesn't want you to touch anything
B	is that included?
D	yeah
D	before we go home
B	well I'll save going home with a pile of dirty washing
D	yeah
B	after well it's depressing after a holiday
D	it is depressing after a holiday
B	yeah oh
E	when are you back in work?
D	oh
