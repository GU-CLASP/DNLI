B	mm
C	very sensible
A	oh I think they will be
B	mm
A	I think they will
C	I now I thought when you were with the other woman
A	the other thing
C	right? When you were with her
C	I mean I thought that her daughter would actually lead
A	no
C	you don't think so? I thought she would've
B	both
C	yeah but I meant when
B	can see a lot of
C	when you're
B	they always have done haven't they
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah but when you're
C	when you're with somebody and you don't  and you don't  want to be yes it's like them bully er if you like
A	yeah
C	yes
A	when I told when I cos
C	that's right
B	mm
C	yeah
A	because of the way they are
B	mm
A	and then
B	mm
C	no
A	I said this is the way  this is the way  these are the boundaries that are in
C	that's right
A	mm
C	yeah
A	I says and that's part of the that's the the problem
B	mm
C	well
A	I don't think she will
C	Don't you think she
A	no
C	can see it?
A	no
C	well no
A	yeah
C	this is what they do
A	yeah
C	it's horrible ain't it
A	mm
C	the way youngsters in that type of environment go
A	yeah
C	horrible thought
A	you know
C	mhm
A	now Easton's fine
C	no
A	er but they moved to Taverham
C	no
A	now
B	mm
A	as as they did
C	no
A	because they're
C	what they are
A	what you
C	yeah
A	what you've
B	mm
A	what you've got
C	yeah
A	now sometimes you can't you're in that position where you can't get out of that
C	well that's right
B	mm
C	yeah
A	you know
C	I mean my brother actually lives in Bowthorpe
A	you know
C	he bought the house yonks ago
A	yeah
C	worse
B	mm
C	there
A	yeah
C	no
A	at this point in time
C	not at this particular time
B	mm
C	no
A	you know
B	yeah
A	around her
C	yeah
B	oh
A	so
C	I mean er
A	they're they're becoming certain certain roads will become the the roads that
C	no go areas and stuff
A	the the roads that are not owner-occupied
C	yeah
A	dare I say it
B	mm
A	are the areas that have that problem
C	yeah
B	mm
A	Cos people don't care about you know
C	they just don't care about their environment
B	yeah
C	or nothing
A	and and it does appear that even the housing associations don't put that much emphasis into those areas where they should be
C	no
A	if you're just a normal person who hasn't got any young children anything like that they don't wanna know
C	no
A	they just get by
C	yeah
B	mm
A	you know
C	no
A	you know
B	yeah
A	I don't er
C	that's such a shame though about I mean the government and and the powers that be knew what they were doing when they put all these houses cheek to cheek and jowl by jowl
A	well
C	yeah
A	so we'll get rid of the back to
B	mm
A	but we'll give you a tower block
C	yeah
A	how many
C	well that's right
A	when they can walk out their door?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	give me the back-to-back houses
B	mm
C	yeah
A	right? And if you look at the modern estates now they're no different to the back-to-back houses
C	no they're not
A	at all
C	no
A	you've just got a
C	mm
A	bit more garden or you're you've got a nice a bigger
C	yeah
A	yeah I know where you mean
C	and down Marlpit Lane you got all those flats
A	yeah
C	and helped people out when they were ill
A	mm
C	many cars about then
A	it wasn't just that though was it
C	well they just wanted to destroy the community
A	no
B	mhm
A	if you think where where they
C	yeah
A	it's industrial units or
C	yeah
A	so they can charge a premium for
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
C	run out and get it in for them
A	but society changed then didn't it
C	yeah
A	who who made that? Who changed that society?
C	well I think the sixities have got a lot to  lot to  to to do with it
A	mm
C	and the tower blocks didn't have any they er people were locked in their little cell
A	in their little box
C	and and when they came out onto the communal staircases they were awful concrete places where they were all dark and horrible
A	just dark and dismal
C	there was no lifts
A	the lifts didn't er lifts hardly worked
B	yeah
A	or they were vandalized
C	yeah
A	and then people'd pee in the corridors and stuff like that
C	that's it
B	yeah
C	and then start sleeping in the corridors
B	mm
C	oh
A	I remember the where I used to live they built a tower block on what was called Sladefield Road Secondary Modern
A	Cos
C	yeah
A	and then further up was the secondary modern school
C	yeah
A	well just with Birmingham changing how it changed they built Washwood Heath Comprehensive
C	went to the comprehensive
A	went to the comprehensive
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and that was the
C	yeah yeah your yeah
A	all those things
C	mm
A	I'll have to see whether it's still there matter of fact on Google Earth
C	oh that's strange that they they create huge no go areas in different cities
A	well they in Birmingham they did this they did Chelmsley Wood and Castle Vale
C	no?
A	they have knocked it down
C	oh right
A	alright? Castle Bromwich
A	school got burnt down a few times
B	oh dear
A	because it was so bad
B	huh
C	yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	talk about this
C	was there? Yeah
A	and they've put them back to houses and stuff like that
C	yeah
A	so
B	mm
C	well people do need their own space don't they
A	mm
B	mm
C	they need their own space
A	well it's keeping the people down though isn't it
C	that is keeping the people down
B	mm
C	yeah
A	you know why did Margaret Thatcher open up selling the council houses?
C	well that's true
A	social housing
C	social housing now
A	but why?
C	and that's all privatized ain't it
A	yeah
C	it's
A	but why do they do it?
C	I dunno
A	because if you've got a mortgage and you're putting money in you've got to continue to work so going on strike makes no difference does it
B	yeah
C	you can't strike if you've got a mortgage
A	you know
B	mm
A	so we can control the people this way by
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	hm
A	we get money for it
C	they gotta buy furniture
B	mm
C	and they gotta then they gotta
A	so we'll do this therefore we get money in to er so we can do things with it
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and why  and why  are the government going back to this is your education you've gotta have this?
C	yeah
A	because it controls certain factions of the population
B	mm
C	yep
A	so vocational courses for people with hands-on experience
C	yeah
A	can't have that
A	because that gives them that independence that they can earn
B	mm
C	yeah
A	you know
C	but then there's the other the
A	yeah
C	governments
A	you only want certain people to have the to know those rights though don't you
C	yeah
A	and er which people do you want? The people in the upper
C	yeah
A	of the classes
C	the ones that will become politicians
A	yeah
C	and the ones that will become doctors
A	yeah
C	that will become
B	mm
C	yeah
A	if you look at it
C	give them a good living
A	yeah
C	and keep the  keep the  workers down
A	yeah
C	yes
A	so that means that you could be working one area of the country and earning more than somebody doing the same job somewhere else
C	that's right
A	isn't that back to how it used to be a long long time ago?
C	yeah
C	right? They owned a
A	mhm
C	getting half the pay
A	mm
C	well that's true
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	there's a good six thousand pound on teacher's salary in London
C	yeah
B	mm
C	but that don't do them any good do it?
B	no
C	because
A	Cos the prices down there are
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	isn't it
C	well er why? That doesn't cost London council any more than our councils to you know the the
A	there's a need isn't it
C	there's a supply and
B	yeah
C	demand
A	that's what it comes down to
B	people want the houses
B	they don't want the ones up in Yorkshire and Derbyshire so much do they
C	well
B	mm
C	yeah
A	some nice houses for sale in Yorkshire at the moment
C	we saw a nice place for sale in Glenridding didn't we
B	I didn't like it
C	you didn't like it no
B	no
C	but it had five
B	you want a better house than that
C	five bedrooms for  for the for  the people that lived there

B	and stuff like that
C	like digital art
B	we put ourselves as just Concept
A	right

C	A set of three
B	mm
A	right
B	and they decide whether they want them or not
A	mm
B	we'll either collect them or not
A	yeah
B	but we thought as a like a start
A	oh yeah
C	that was
B	so if you
C	Cos she walked in there the other day didn't she
B	mm
C	and saw er  saw er
B	I just

A	yeah
B	the picture of your your train's here
A	what
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	with um in blue
A	in blue?
C	the
A	oh right
B	the digital one
C	sir Sir Sir
B	I think that's that's slightly different to
A	mm
C	sir what is it called?
B	to the one
A	see that got tweeted by
C	Yorkshire
A	North York Moors Railway that did
C	mm
B	right
A	that picture
B	oh
A	mm
B	well there's a possibility up there anyway
A	mm
B	you can
C	well once you're in there they er they'll take other bits likely
B	well that's what we were hoping
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and
B	so we've made a start and
C	which one of er yours did he take? Or did he want?
B	er um purple bridge
C	purple bridge
B	mystic bridge
C	mystic bridge
B	mm
A	well I got some websites that I need to do so
C	yeah
B	mm
A	so I
C	yeah
A	but I need to get that down
C	oh yeah? Yeah
A	Cos if it's the hard drive that is gone
C	yeah
A	I can get a new hard drive for forty pound
C	yeah
A	and it's a Dual-Core computer in any case
C	yeah
A	even though it's
C	yeah
A	and I could probably
C	yeah
A	it might be worth
C	you might as well
B	mm
C	yeah
A	for a hundred pound I could have that machine up and running again
C	yeah
A	probably
C	yeah
A	no
C	yeah but that could be the dust down it
A	no
C	is it?
A	so as you start it up it goes wuh tuk tuk tuk
C	does it?
A	tuk
C	oh
A	wuh tuk
B	yeah
A	tuk
B	oh
C	you could've used the
A	I tried that as well
C	you tried an Irish screwdriver?
B	mm
C	oh dear
A	I just gently tapped it with the back
C	what? With a sledge-hammer?
A	no
B	hm
A	so but you spend a hundred pound on buying a new hard drive and a new
C	yeah
A	operating system and you can get a new basic computer for two hundred and twenty pound
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	so
B	mm
C	you can't get anything off the hard drive then?
A	I don't think so
C	yeah but you got a lot of stuff on that hard drive
A	I've got most of my documents off there
C	have you?
A	I've got all my documents
C	yeah
B	uh
A	and I got all my photos
B	mm
C	our hard drive our second hard drive we've got
B	yeah
A	tut tut
B	so we're now
C	so we've got rid of about
B	delete delete delete delete
C	we got about
C	of er
B	stupid photos
C	but there's still
A	that's the problem
C	yeah
B	they're stupid photos
C	well
A	they're
C	yeah
A	I've got loads of duplicates cos
C	why do they duplicate everything?
A	from somewhere er loads of duplicates from somewhere
B	yes
C	we have duplicates don't we
B	yeah
C	where do they come from?
A	dunno
B	yeah
A	you're thinking I've got those there
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	the original or something like that
B	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	is going to delete more
C	but it don't
B	all the related ones
A	mm
C	we we got a program
B	huh mm
C	that we we delete ours in
A	mm
B	in the blank
C	and all you got is a blank space
C	but the information of what er what the photograph was
A	yeah
C	all the
B	mm
C	is still there
A	mm
C	delete delete can't you whatever you see
B	mm
C	so we have to delete the metadata off as well
A	from that one place? Tut
B	yeah we're gonna be really strict from now on anyway
C	yeah
B	we can't delete any of his
C	well we us we spent between us
C	nearly all yesterday deleting
A	mm
C	dot dot dot dot dot forty-nine
B	but you can't name them all though can you?
C	well you could do if er as soon as you put them on
B	if
A	well under Windows 7 you can
C	yeah
A	a lot easier
C	yeah
A	but I always rather than I always give them a name so like
C	to the folder?
A	to the  to the  actual image itself
C	yeah?
A	so Lakes O nine for instance
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and then
C	yeah
A	O two O three
C	right
B	ah
A	rather than just keeping the image number
C	yeah
A	DCYM or something
B	mm
C	yeah
B	right
C	yeah
A	depending on how you do it
C	yeah
A	but er I can't get the only way I can get pictures on the iPad at the moment is by e-mailing them
B	mm
C	you got your same e-mail number on your iPad have you?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah? What about the attachments? Do they  do they  come? Yeah

A	they do  they do  iWord
C	yeah
A	it's six pound ninety-nine
C	is that all? Is it compatible with Microsoft Word?
A	mm
C	yeah? Cos
A	I think it's how you save it at the end of the day
C	yeah
A	and I don't know whether you what happens when it's full
C	yeah
A	what happens when it's full?
C	oh that's true
A	mm
C	course
B	yeah
A	so
C	yeah?
A	and then when I er opened my iPad up it was
B	yeah
A	Cos it's stored on the cloud
B	oh
A	and all I did was
A	and there it was on my iPad
B	mm

A	which links to my iPad
B	right
C	yeah
B	oh

A	three hundred and eighty
C	well there you go

A	the only difference with the iPad
B	huh
A	the new iPad is it's got a better screen

A	Don't think so
A	I've not seen one
C	Cos they're not big enough are they? I mean
A	well if you think the first computer
B	but if you start adding bits to it it spoils what it is doesn't it?
C	yeah
B	all the time
C	yeah
A	you need to be able to back it up somewhere along the lines
C	yeah
A	but that you back it up via
C	mm
A	iTunes
C	yeah
A	the
B	mm
C	or the cloud
