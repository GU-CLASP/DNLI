A	oh I see what you mean
B	yeah yeah
A	yes
B	well they're the ones who actually grow the grape
A	but it must have originated yeah
B	version but the grape version is called Sauvignon Blanc
A	to have the name though

B	well
A	when food becomes an entertainment in its own right

B	exactly yes
A	erm and I hope you've got posh evening
B	oh yes
A	dresses and things

B	I've got two or three
A	you might have to consult your neighbour with the you know the clothes that she gives away maybe she can
A	pass some more on to you
B	yes yeah
B	well she has actually
A	cos you're going to need them
B	she's she's passed me on er several sweaters just recently
A	mm
B	.and and and of which two or three are cashmere
B	and the others

B	yeah yeah and the others are you know fine quality lambswool
A	and she's always absolutely immaculately
B	yeah
A	dressed
B	yes yeah
A	got very good taste but expensive
B	well I'm gonna stick my earrings in now that sounds a bit silly but I have been in the habit of not wearing earrings
A	mm
B	er you know for a long time and then find that I couldn't get an earring
A	have they closed up?
B	yeah but I went back thinking I'd have to get them re-pierced but er
A	yeah
B	the lady in the shop manages to sort of
A	yeah
B	get it in and I kept it in for a fortnight
A	yes
B	but she did say you know wear them but what a difference it makes actually
A	why did you stop?
B	well I mean out in Greece I tend not to wear them you know
A	mm
B	if I'm just sort of slogging around at home and I don't I tend to think of the you know going out put earring this was the ear that was the problem one actually
A	I haven't got the earlobes
B	oh now just
A	I don't think
B	yeah
A	I've got enough room for pierced ears
B	have you not oh let me see
A	hardly anything there
B	oh no oh right you've got
A	there's nothing there though is there?
B	yeah yeah
B	no cos yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	but I always found them I once got them pierced and found it really uncomfortable
B	did you?
A	yeah horrible
A	because you've got the other side of it
B	oh right it's yes in the
A	and it digs in
B	oh yeah
A	if you're
B	yeah yeah well that's maybe because your ears
A	it's really cos there's nothing
A	it's not dangling down or anything
B	yeah yeah
A	so too small
B	I mean I decided you know when I got my hair cut really short that
A	earrings are good idea
B	earrings would be a were were a good idea
A	yeah
B	you know seen from the back
A	yeah cos
B	that I am female
A	long hair it's all
B	yeah yeah
A	covered up anyway so
B	yes
A	just to make sure
B	called me you know come here old man you know and I turn round and
A	I don't think that would happen
C	chef needs some red wine actually
B	oh does he? yes
A	but
B	mm uhu uhu
A	and I thought what a good idea
B	yes
A	when you're at a party
B	very pretty it was too
A	but it's lovely and
B	yeah
A	it stops people getting embarrassed that they've forgotten your name
B	yeah yes yes cos there
A	so
B	there it was actually yeah
A	yeah
A	everyone should just wear a badge shouldn't they?
B	yes yes
A	yeah
A	mm
B	and er she was actually I mean she said to me oh that that'll go towards my rent and I said
A	that is that's
B	no way is that going towards your rent
A	ah
B	your mother's gonna pay for your rent
A	yeah
B	you know cos we give her an allowance
A	it just disappears then doesn't it? yeah

B	is it?
C	and I tried her again and
B	mm
C	she won't take it so
B	oh that's interesting that they sort of have a litter and say I'm not having any of that
A	postnatal depression
B	do they eat them or strangle them or?
C	just suffocate them or
B	mm mm
C	so I think I'll
D	is that alright dear?
A	mm
C	I'll have to look for another female rabbit
B	mm
C	cos I know the male's good
B	that's actually a very tasty bit of lamb actually
A	it's lovely
B	yeah
C	it's very good
A	where did you get the lamb from?
B	that was from erm Aldi
D	Aldi
A	mm
C	right
B	I picked it up on on the way here cos you know I went down to that that store
A	yeah
B	actually to get wood
D	quite tasty aren't they?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	what's in them?

C	oats can I have a half more?
B	you can have a whole one
D	well no no because there are only two of them there
A	they need eating so have help yourself
C	well I'm glad you chose lamb instead of the chicken
D	mm er
C	oh yeah yeah of course you did
B	you didn't did you?
D	yes I did
A	yeah we put it back in the oven
B	mm
D	well weirdly it was the breast that was underdone and the legs and thighs were fine

B	something very attractive about having kale and carrots together because
C	mm
A	mm
B	and nothing the least bit insipid about them
D	yeah
B	uhu
C	there's erm
D	mm
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	yeah it really is
B	uhu
A	deep
C	mm
B	kale is

B	particularly good for your eyes
C	mm
B	mm
D	there's also more gravy if you want
B	mm
D	some of that dear darling
A	I don't but
B	and your roast potatoes whenever you put them in and whatever you did with them and
A	shake them about
C	mm
D	which one did you use?
A	mm
C	well I thought I used the little one
D	is that the one nearest you?
B	no
A	no I'm confused
C	small against the wall that's what that's what I'm
B	mm
C	remembering
B	mm it's a circle
A	but that's got the bigger though
B	mm
A	I think
B	there's it is a circle divided into two by an arc
A	I think the one against the wall's the little one
B	yeah because the
A	and I think the one nearest is the big
B	the circle is like that and the the divider is like that
A	yeah yeah I know
D	uhu
B	so yeah so
B	is that
B	it raises it just that little bit cos certainly in the shop it seemed quite low
C	yeah
A	it was low yeah
C	and actually it doesn't seem so low
D	it's healthier to have a lower seat actually
A	healthier?
B	it probably is
A	yeah
B	I mean anatomically speaking
D	well
A	without
C	well
B	mm
A	going into it
C	well for you
A	too much
C	it means that your feet can touch the floor now
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	I can read a book without being on tiptoes
A	it's an amazing
B	we were squatting
A	price though
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	fifty-three pounds for all that
B	I that's an amazing
A	doesn't it cost them
B	yeah
A	more to make that?
D	gonna have one more

A	but they don't pay for a hotel in London for some reason
D	uhu
A	which I think

A	because should be in London anyway
C	cos they presume that everyone lives in London
A	yeah London centric
B	yeah
C	mm
B	or that nobody lives in Swansea
D	strange
A	mm
D	because the most expensive place
A	yeah
D	to get
B	yeah
D	a hotel
A	I think that's a bit
B	yeah
A	too
D	I mean extravagantly expensive
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
D	a hotel in London
C	the production manager I've been working with he
B	yeah
C	or whatever and he couldn't get back and he said oh I'll have to get a hotel the company'll pay for it but he looked around in Islington two hundred and sixty pounds
A	it's
C	a night
D	a night
C	and that was the Travelodge
A	that's
B	oh
A	that's what you'd earn in a
D	fucking hell
A	in my world I'd earn that if
B	did he take it?
C	no no he just went
C	and he
B	no
A	sleep on the
C	he eventually
A	pavement
C	he looked around and he got one for I think it was a hundred and thirty
B	yeah
C	and it was down in the
B	yeah
A	how much is the
B	yeah right ah
A	youth hostels now? how much are the youth hostels in London?
C	oh god knows
B	well
A	it would be
B	mm
A	quite interesting to find out it must be at least fifty quid a night I think
B	yeah
C	god knows I mean they er but so this show there was a particular you know Alan Rickman died?
A	yeah
C	well his funeral I think was on Thursday or Wednesday and a lot of the cast know him so they wanted to go to the funeral see so
A	mm
C	they needed time off from the rehearsal period so to compensate for the hours cos they still needed and I think he
C	but they
C	but they did it anyway so they had to do a long day and they had to work till eleven which by the time they got out of costume and whatever it was gone then so they had to get a
D	yeah
C	supplied with a taxi
B	yeah
C	so they had to book the taxis anyway the taxi bill for that night was nine hundred pounds
D	fucking hell
C	just to take the cast home
C	none of us
C	you know we were all going home on on
A	you're nobodies
B	on on foot or whatever
C	just nine
B	yeah
C	hundred quid just
B	yeah
C	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's like
D	Addison Lee
C	yeah yeah
B	they'll be hoping for a long run after all this
C	well you know and I mean they I was
A	it sounds like it's a bit beset with problems
C	at the moment yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	hopefully we'll sort them and
A	people dying and things
B	who was it who died?
A	that are made to go round not going round
D	Alan Rickman
C	Alan Rickman
B	oh right
A	I love
C	do you know him?
A	I loved Alan Rickman
D	who you may know from who
C	he was in
D	no you won't
A	Truly Madly Deeply
C	yeah
D	that was his first major role
C	and he was

A	grumpy
D	actors playing the baddies in film
C	Professor Snipe in
A	yeah
C	Harry Potter
A	and
B	didn't see that either
C	you would you would have
B	I think I do
C	he's well known
B	yes now I mean you're saying all this
A	and he was in a very good
B	I remember reading the news about him
A	a very good
B	he wasn't that old actually was he?
A	he was in a very good film
D	sixty-nine
B	oh he was as old as that?
A	a very good film set
B	yeah
A	during
D	oh
A	the building of the
B	yeah
A	DLR
C	oh
A	it was about a brother and sister incestuous relationship and he played the husband
C	oh right oh
B	I mean these people they're you know they're dying in their late sixties early seventies I mean what's his name has just died er
D	David Bowie?
B	Terry no Terry Wogan
C	Terry Wogan yes
D	er er
B	was seventy-one
A	so
B	and
A	what is it with all?
B	David Bowie wasn't even that was he?
D	sixty-nine
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so if you think that Terry Wogan was almost the same age as David Bowie
D	oh well done
A	that's quite weird really cos they're very different aren't they?
B	oh aren't they just? yes well one was this
B	eternal youth
A	eternally old one was
B	mm
A	and one was eternal youth
B	well both of you
B	we shall come again
C	yeah
B	yeah dinner bed and breakfast is alright
B	the hosts are not around
C	yeah but there's
B	yes
C	to be had so
B	yes
B	mm
D	yeah and anyone else will except for you
D	you didn't have your soup
C	mm
A	I wouldn't have my mains if I'd had soup
B	would your tendency be well particularly with sitting here would your thinking be to keep the kitchen there keep it as it is?
C	don't know I think it's you have to live in the space I mean I
B	yeah yeah you are er erm
A	what do you mean giving more use?
B	well it looked very small with little workspace but it it works very well
A	yeah but if you keep it minimalist it's
B	yes yes
A	absolutely fine
B	yeah
A	but you have to be ruthless
B	yeah yeah
A	so and I've been ruthless some things have had to go
B	yeah yeah
A	so
B	yeah mm
A	and all the work surfaces need to be kept clear
B	yes
D	and
B	mind you I think that of any kitchen
A	stop being sarcastic
C	you have no chance in mine at the moment
B	really?
C	I've er I've had a temporary kitchen for the last twelve years
B	oh really?
C	and
B	now why's it temporary?
C	cos
B	you were planning to move somewhere else or
C	yes
B	yeah
C	now that was the plan but when you've lived with it I actually quite like the room that the kitchen's in so we're gonna keep the kitchen where it is but just knock a big hole through the wall to it brings it into the sitting room
B	right yes yes
C	so
B	yeah but as you say it's only after you've lived there for a for somehow that you can
C	mm
B	get the feel of the place
C	but er my my work my worktops are
B	pardon?
C	my worktops are full
C	you know it's just I mean it
B	yeah
C	you know I have certain spaces with various chopping boards that are clear
B	yes

A	look it's
B	yeah but if you think of that as
A	no that's bigger
B	no no if you think of
C	I didn't mean to install it to cause
C	a family rift
C	I'll take the flush away and you'll have to do a bucket
B	so all of this
A	yeah well to me that
B	no but think of the diameter
A	no okay
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so so it's the top one
A	yeah
B	and actually it looks smaller
A	alright well that's my strange
B	yeah
A	autistic brain
B	yeah
A	then
B	well
A	but it's to me that looks like the bigger one
B	if you look at it yeah but
B	can you see? can you see that it's
A	er there's more space
B	yeah
A	in here yeah
B	yeah it's very very solid
A	oh it's lovely
B	yeah
B	so this little one is the half flush
A	that's the small one I'd still like an arrow
B	and this
A	well
B	well I think
A	they'll just flush whichever and what happens if you flush both of them at the same time?
B	well I don't think it matters
D	a super flush
A	is that a super flush?
D	yeah
B	oh is it?
A	I don't know there must be some instructions somewhere
B	no I think you're just meant to work it out

D	it's about five mils smaller or wider than that door there
C	but the one into
D	is weird

B	mm mm
C	erm the whole
B	and the piers even the mm mm
C	yeah yeah but also erm seeing London from a different angle
B	mm
C	it it was like being subterranean it was it was just so
B	a real sort of Victorian sense
C	looking up it was lovely it was really good really good and
A	get another one
C	er no I'm I'm I'm
B	yeah I mean
C	I mean he's well into it
B	I know when when you when you go down
B	on the Thames boat the the
D	that's a good idea
B	erm
C	mm
B	edge in
C	mm
B	these huge great skyscrapers
C	yeah
B	and
D	yeah I can name them
C	yeah
B	mm
D	Sir John Gielgud owns one of them called The Grape or the The Grapes
A	he's dead
B	he owns a pub?
D	is he?
A	mm he died ages ago
D	do I mean him then? or or he used to own
A	I don't know do you mean? no I know who you mean
D	mm
A	he's definitely dead
D	okay maybe I mean somebody else but that's one of them that's right on the
B	Ian McKellen
D	it could be Ian McKellen
B	mm
D	or are we just gonna name gay actors? but it's it's one that's
B	I think it is Ian McKellen actually
D	right on the waterfront
B	I think I I seem to know that
C	is that Gandalf? does Ian McKellen
A	er
C	play Gandalf?
C	in Lord of the Rings?
D	yes
C	so
B	mm I
C	right
D	that was probably also the last time you saw him darling
B	oh no no no cos he's one of my favourite actors actually
D	well name something else
B	erm well over the
D	that we might see him in
A	stop being so
B	oh no
D	sorry
B	well let me finish my story anyway
D	she's not finished
B	but he was this was at the Edinburgh Festival at the Assembly Rooms which
D	yeah
B	of course is a a you know a sort of
C	right
B	I mean unbelievable actually I mean it was unbelievable as a simple memory exercise you know
A	mm
B	halfway through Edward the second you sort of suddenly threw yourself into a Richard speech but erm absolutely superb
C	mm
B	and a
D	I've never seen him on the stage
A	I get confused
B	mm
A	being Ian McKellen and the other one
A	no there's another
D	yeah they were in a terrible terrible sitcom together
A	no but that was Ian McKellen
D	not so long ago
A	wasn't it? or is that the other one that I'm thinking of?
D	they were both in it
A	no
D	oh sorry
B	yeah who is the other one yeah?
D	you're right I'm thinking of McKellen again aren't I?
A	mm
D	oh I can't remember I'm useless
C	oh
D	at names so
C	yeah
D	there's no point
C	so I can
A	mm
C	but he's not in the last Star Wars film cos he's got killed killed off in
D	okay
C	the previous one but he played the emperor
D	have you seen have you seen the new one
C	yes
D	did you take the lad to it?
C	no no he'd
D	oh
C	he'd er
D	in France?
C	yeah yeah we went to see a
D	in English?
C	er yeah yeah yeah it was in English they had it had erm French subtitles on it but erm yeah we went to
D	the Bond
C	the Bond yeah which I'd like to but I'll
B	yeah
C	watch it at home so
D	thing is the turnaround these days
C	I know
D	I mean growing up you used to have to wait sort of like five six seven years
C	yeah
D	before you could see a film
C	well
D	if you'd missed it and you get it on video
C	that's right cos it's
D	now it's like
C	no
D	within twelve months you can
C	yeah well
D	that's very well reviewed
C	erm yeah erm and there was a
B	oh right yeah
D	it stings
A	why?
A	cos it's you can't
C	what do you call them? er where they all get together and then see each other for at least ten minutes
B	oh
C	yeah yeah
B	at least oh yes yeah
C	and they there must have been
B	to be to be avoided
C	there was probably probably only about thirty people in there and they're all Brits you know
B	yeah yeah
C	but it was
B	yeah
C	well you know first time I went to the cinema it was a lovely little cinema actually and it was really cheap and
B	yeah
C	but the film the film was very good
D	mm
C	yeah I must admit yeah no I I'd recommend it
D	oh it's got er Mark Rylance
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	in it
C	yeah
D	hasn't it?
C	no
D	I think he's up for an Oscar Mark he is up for an Oscar
C	for that?
D	yep
C	I
D	best supporting actor
C	well I I I hope he gets it actually
D	mm
C	cos erm he does
D	he doesn't do a lot of film roles for some reason does he?
C	very good well he is a very particular to theatre actor
D	yeah
A	mm
B	really? oh
C	used to be erm the artistic director at The Almeida see so
A	mm
C	we used to have the emperor of the universe was running
C	the Almeida theatre
B	so

D	have you heard of darling?
A	Ian McKellen?
B	no Ian McDiarmid
D	Ian McDiarmid
C	Ian McDiarmid
A	I probably have I think I've probably seen
C	you would you would if you've seen the Star Wars films
A	okay

A	yeah
B	if you say
A	you say you were allergic and you keep rubbing it in
D	I do not recognise well you wouldn't recognise him in Star Wars cos
A	I want to see
B	if that makes your skin itch stop doing it
D	yeah
A	yes it would make sense to take that action
D	I can give it to
A	that non-action
D	if he grows a beard
C	oh I like mine just as a stubble
C	you haven't noticed I've had my hair cut since I've been here
D	yeah I have I like it
C	so do I I go and see my little
B	mm
D	in Islington?

B	is that in France?
C	yeah no no no here
B	oh here yeah
C	yeah there's a little barber shop
B	yeah
C	that
D	I would have done it for you
C	I'm sure you would
D	gratis
C	yeah
A	I've a delightful little hairdresser's up the road it's just
C	yeah
A	your bog standard hairdresser's it's not pretentious
B	and what does she charge for a cut?
A	erm seventeen pounds
B	yeah
C	yeah see I mine's eight
A	yeah
C	eight pound and I I always pay a tenner for it
A	well she does my fringe
D	yeah but
A	yeah it would be eighty
D	and be in there for like most of the day
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's like
C	yeah
A	absolutely not very good
C	yeah
A	either
D	and if you
C	yeah
A	so
D	factor in travel
A	and just because it's some trendy place in London
C	exactly well this is
A	and and you get the same result
C	this is right opposite
D	Boots
C	well no by yeah by Boots you know it's just round the corner in a up a little street but
B	yeah right
C	that's it
B	yeah
C	and I go in and go er where's where's the girl with the glasses?
D	mm
C	oh she's downstairs well I'll wait for her then
B	oh really? you always
C	and I just
B	yeah
C	and I go in and then we start chatting and oh I remember now you know
B	yes yeah
C	but she's lovely yeah I mean nothing you know but she just does
B	yeah
C	a really nice cut and I'm
B	yeah
C	happy and
B	and she's nice nice
C	she trims my eyebrows and
C	all that sort of thing
A	mm
C	and she's lovely
B	yeah gosh yeah
D	I had a
C	yeah
D	or exorbitantly priced and just thought I can just do better like I had one haircut
C	yeah
D	the chap just spent all the time talking to me
C	mm
D	and seeming not to be paying much attention and when I got home I had to go over my hair with my
C	yeah that's
D	trimmers and I thought well hang on why have I just spent twenty quid?
C	exactly
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	I I think you know a tenner is is
D	but if you're getting a good cut
C	perfect you know
D	then I don't mind paying
C	good cut
D	but if it's something you can just do
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	yourself in ten minutes
C	mm
D	for nothing then then I'm not gonna do that
A	well my hairdresser's is a kind of slightly chavvy hairdresser's where they do nails as well so it's all these
C	oh yeah
A	great big bright coloured nails
B	yeah
A	really awful ones and everything
B	mm
A	so someone's there having their nails done and then
C	mm
A	these great big
A	big
C	well we we do have a we have a a hairdresser in France an English lady who's self-employed and you know we
B	yeah
C	they they're always saying can we go and see
B	really? yeah
C	you know and every
A	really?
C	month or something
B	yeah yeah
C	you know she's like
B	yeah
C	because they want to have the you know
B	yeah
C	and she does hair dyes and in fact
B	yeah
C	sorted whatever she's doing
B	yeah
C	tints or
B	yeah
C	cuts or
A	dyed
B	yes
C	you know
A	but the thing is a hairdresser is a hairdresser is a hairdresser and they all know how to cut hair
C	no
A	and they're all trained to sort of you know
C	no
A	do whatever
C	no you get you get
B	but I think
A	that thing so
C	but but you get good you get good hairdressers and you get bad hairdressers you know
A	well it depends on their personality
B	well and I but I think
C	no no
A	they're all trained
C	no they may be all trained but they need to understand what you want
B	want
A	yeah true
B	and and what your hair does
A	yeah
B	yes the the quirky way
A	yeah
B	bits grow
A	and it's very erm
B	cos I've had the same hairdresser
A	random really
B	for years now
A	it's terrible because
B	at thirty-five pounds a shot
A	I usually
C	right
B	yeah
A	find someone and then they move to Italy or something
C	yeah no well that's it
A	it's really annoying
C	that's why I'm always surprised when I I always poke my nose in if I'm
A	yeah
C	where's the girl with the glasses? and
B	yeah
C	if she's there I go oh perfect
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	can you cut my hair? but
B	yeah
C	any of the others cos I have tried one of the others and
A	yeah they just
C	but it wasn't so good
A	don't understand
B	no no
C	no wasn't
A	there was only
C	just wasn't good
A	ever one hairdresser that understood how to do the back of my neck when I had a bob and when he left no one could do the back of my neck
B	yeah
A	and it always looked awful that's why I've got long hair now really but erm the only who knew
C	mm
B	yeah
A	knew how to do a smooth look without the sort of duck's bottom effect
B	yeah
A	cos I've got thick hair so
B	yeah
A	no sadly he left
C	yeah
B	yes and
A	but I think you're safer when you've got longer hair though cos nothing can go that wrong when you've got long hair anyway
C	well
A	and you just have a trim
C	unless they cut it badly and you think oh I'm gonna have to have it all cut off
B	well no
A	but that can't really happen when it's long anyway cos
C	well well no well it can
B	well at least if it's long you've got a you can make it a if it goes wrong you can have it cut a little bit shorter
C	mm
B	to correct it whereas
C	mm
B	if it's short and it goes wrong there's
A	yeah that's the most disastrous
B	not much leeway
C	it's funny cos
A	the short awful cut
C	there's a
A	is the worst one
B	yeah
C	you know we've got two hairdressers in our local village right okay you know the one is the blue rinse brigade she's
B	oh right yeah
C	the the it's that's where all
B	and stiff
C	all
B	stiff curls
C	and then have that
D	the
C	dye
A	is that still going the blue rinse?
C	oh god yeah in
A	how funny I didn't know that was
C	thirty years behind
B	yeah
C	but
A	blue rinse is a
C	and then there's another one that is like aimed at the younger or I
C	dunno where fashion's going really but
B	it it was one of these with a half
D	was it asymmetrical?
B	half a side
A	is it
C	oh it was
A	was it a Phil Oakey? you know
C	oh
A	Human League
C	kind of yeah
A	asymmetric
B	what did
C	well he goes oh this is what the fashion is now
C	I just went
B	yeah
C	awful you know and I
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	whereas the Frenchman says you know you say oh I'd like this and this they go okay yeah okay
B	yeah
C	and they go che-che
A	yeah exactly
C	there you go that's what you want
B	yeah
C	er no
B	and it's a bit late to say well no it wasn't what I asked for
C	that's not that's not
A	but it's like when you
C	what I asked for
A	when you say
C	and it's not an angry statement
B	no
C	at all
A	no no it's funny because you can say I want it really flat flat flat so what about flat don't you understand? because you'll come out with big hair
C	yeah I know I know
B	yeah
A	you know
B	big hair
A	I think they just start enjoying themselves really with the hairdryer
C	exactly their
A	and start oh this is fun
C	as like a oh oh I need a practice
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you know I'll have a you know I'll
A	you're a piece of art
C	have a play around
A	you're an object
B	I mean it's incredibly personal
C	yeah
B	you know your hair is
C	yeah
A	I know
B	you know exactly when it is right and
A	but that's why I
B	you know exactly when it's wrong
C	yeah
A	I do hate hairdressers though because I don't hate them but to them they're just it's just a job
B	yeah
A	but to you it's
C	no but but yeah yeah
A	deeply personal
C	well exactly
B	yeah
A	there's that
C	yeah but it's also like you know it's like going to the dentist isn't it? you know
A	yeah
C	and it's just a job to a dentist
A	yeah it's just doing a mechanical thing
C	but you've gotta be comfortable with
B	yeah
C	what they've done haven't you you know?
A	you're a person
C	you know?
A	there is a person in here mm but they do just see hair I suppose
C	mm
A	they see hair but dunno
C	mm
A	weird
B	no yes yes
A	oh now
B	an unforgiving mirror
A	yeah
B	at that
A	why not at least make it flattering?
B	yeah

C	mm
B	but I got referred to the dental

B	you know yeah
C	a better service
C	right
B	erm what they do would cost me about a hundred pounds in our local dentist
C	no exactly yeah
B	and it's such fun because
C	yeah
B	you know they're they're students so
B	you know they're
D	you like talking to them mummy
B	oh yes I mean this er
A	no you shouldn't have done that
D	darling you've got to
A	no you don't you put the salt on straight away
D	no that's not true you rinse as much as you can and then you put salt on
B	and I said to her you know well you know how how how many patients have have you seen? cos the third year is the first year that they're exposed to the public so I bounced in and I said said
C	right
B	and there's somebody there so you can see the patient I mean there's a patient sitting as near to you as I am
C	okay
B	erm and I said to
C	mm
D	ah
B	so
D	that would make me a little nervous but if you're not gonna get nervous
B	having gone on from there naturally but you know it's it's
D	when I had acupuncture it was at a student training school
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	attached to the
B	yeah
C	mm
D	but they were all supervised by someone
C	well no yeah
B	yes yes
C	yeah they they're not allowed yeah
B	well as as is
D	yeah by by a
B	yeah
D	you know a
B	yeah
D	top notch
C	mm
B	yes yeah well you know
D	mm
B	face
D	ah
B	completely uneven face is
C	mm
B	one step too far
C	mm
B	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	just get it flaming
C	used to have a at the
B	yeah
C	and it
B	yeah
C	it could be used for something it's always little bits or
B	yeah
C	or if not you used to spend like an afternoon chopping it up for kindling
B	yeah
D	mm
C	cos a couple of the people had have got wood fires and things
B	yes yeah
C	you know so and so I I was out there and saying where's the dustbin gone? cos I was I there's loads of offcuts so I'll just put them in er chop them up for kindling and he said oh don't seem to do it
C	do you know what I mean?
B	oh right yeah
C	and it was just it was getting bagged up and then was just sitting there so in the end
B	yeah
C	it was just like oh
D	oh
B	not worth doing it yeah
C	I no I just thought about it really
B	yeah
C	but you know I'm not but we're talking like sackfuls of kindling
D	yeah
C	and I was just like
B	right
C	I couldn't really carry sackfuls back
B	no no
D	no no not if you
B	not on a bus
C	no
B	yeah and you don't take the van
C	on the bus you know
D	right
C	but if I
D	in your van yeah
B	yeah
C	I would have just
D	load it up
C	I would load it up and just just bring it but
B	mm
D	the bag of kindling I got from Aldi last time actually turned out to just be cut up skirting board
C	oh okay
D	piece of skirting board
C	it's all the offcuts and things
D	I guess ones that were too warped so they do have a some sort of quality control
B	mm
C	yeah
D	just got a machine in to
C	yeah
B	so you I mean you didn't buy the skirting board did you? so how much skirting board
C	no you need
B	do you still need?
C	yeah you need to
D	I need about that much
C	well you need a full length for the under that window don't you?
D	yeah that's about that big isn't it?
C	well no
B	bit long yeah
C	you'll have to put a tape on it
D	no it's about that much
C	bit small I think
B	he is his father's son you see in certain elements still
C	right okay remind
B	board sample
C	so that you can take it
B	yes
C	to the shop and and measure it but I would say it's well at a guess it's this but I I'd say you want like probably a two metre length
D	no no cos it's only the length underneath the window that I need
C	yeah
B	well
C	but it's over a metre
B	it it's no it's actually it's that length less the door
C	yeah
B	that's actually what it is
C	yeah
B	because that door oh no it's a little bit in
C	yeah
D	no it's it's
C	it's it's it's
B	it's a little bit in there
C	it's over a metre
B	oh well over a metre
C	mm
B	which is exactly what that was that measurement he
C	so you're talking
B	he did nonsense says
C	about a metre and a metre and a
D	that's
C	you can use the rest for kindling purposes
B	yeah yeah
D	that's all I'd buy one single length and it's all
C	mm
D	pre measured lengths but that's all I would need
C	mm
B	but why didn't you get one today? you just couldn't
D	because A I wasn't absolutely convinced it was the right
B	oh that you had the right one?
D	type
B	yeah
D	although I was kind of sure and B they were all horribly warped and horrible and I I didn't have the patience to go through
C	patience yeah but I I I've built
B	yeah god
C	where you know I feel you had your mind on other purchases
D	yeah
C	to be honest
B	yes yes it he wasn't he was concentrating
C	yeah
B	on toilets
C	well
B	well at a manner of speaking he was wasn't he?
C	that that was that was
B	yeah
C	that and light switches and bits of string
D	which I've still got to put up I've got to turn the electrics off I didn't realise
C	oh yeah well what to change switches?
D	to change the little cord
C	oh oh
B	what the
C	possibly er
D	er well I I unscrewed the thing and you've got to screw out the little
B	did you buy one?
D	something or other in order to access
C	oh
D	where the
C	okay
D	where the erm
B	I'm gonna move from there
D	where the working is
B	cos it's actually quite chilly
C	do you want to sit here?
B	no I'm gonna sit can I sit erm will
D	for as long as you don't mind moving if he comes in mummy
B	boy there's a hell of a draught coming in although I mean
C	mm
B	the wind is coming in this direction I think so
D	yeah they're
C	mm
B	yeah
D	very
B	yeah
C	I
B	he had what?
D	I quite like
C	shutters
B	oh right yeah
C	yeah
D	I quite like shutters
C	Venetian er not Venetian erm what were they?
D	like fold-out?
C	yeah no they it's er
D	horizontal well I mean laterally?
C	they they're all they're hinged
B	right and and
C	so you can have a
B	rest where?
C	against against
B	the wall?
C	the wall
B	yeah
C	erm but they're also louvred
B	oh right yeah
C	so you can
B	yeah
C	but they've got
B	ah right yes yeah cos
C	but they're split as well so the top you can
B	yeah you can have the top
C	yeah
B	the lower bit yeah
C	but er I mean I'm they weren't cheap
B	no
C	I can't remember how much they were but I I I was quite shocked but they are very well made
B	yeah
C	and they're like they've got this they're wood but they almost look like plastic with the type of paint finish they've got on them
B	yeah
D	just pre pre
C	it's yeah it's all
D	painted
C	pre pre-done
B	yeah
C	so all all the guy came in for the morning and just put them up
B	yeah yeah
C	all done and he measured them all up and all that
B	yeah
C	but they're lovely
C	mm
B	they'd be quite good for privacy there actually yeah
D	privacy
C	mm
D	until the
C	I think
D	the privet hedge grows
C	certainly erm you notice a difference with the heat
D	well otherwise I'd just like these windows replaced but with real windows
C	yeah yeah
D	like for like
A	hello
D	ah look at him looking up
C	proper sort of double glazed
B	yeah double glazed
D	wouldn't even necessarily have to be double glazed I mean I I thought
B	oh they would have to be double glazed
C	you should yeah no
D	well just
B	for oh for heat conservation
D	just the sash window
C	well you can get
D	oh no
D	yeah I had
D	someone here to give me a quote
C	yeah in wood?
D	yeah
C	mm
B	and what was for the snug that was and how much was it for the snug?
D	I can't remember now it's about three or four hundred pounds per window
C	mm
D	they don't the size doesn't matter
B	mind you if it was only three or four hundred that's not bad actually for a whole window
C	mm
B	they're very big windows
C	mm
B	yeah
C	you know
D	oh he's got salt on his nose
B	yeah
A	ah
B	yes yes
A	you won't like that
B	that's we're lucky down in you know
C	mm
A	mm
A	yeah bit raw
B	you know the people that we've used you know we know and they live there
C	mm
B	so you know they can't get away with a real sort of rogue job at all
C	mm
B	you know so
C	mm
B	and most of them work by word of mouth and reputation so
C	exactly yeah
B	so you know their their reputation is is er
C	mm
B	er very valuable for them so they don't want to do badly
D	must get window cleaners as well on the basis that we've never had
A	mm so do
D	they won't reach the top but they could at least do the
A	well I think they would they're window cleaners
D	no I've asked before and they can't reach the top
B	I mean they'd be
C	er what
B	pretty lucky
A	oh
B	to be able to get up to here
C	no?
D	they can get up to here I reckon without any issue
C	well you've been do do they open upstairs?
D	it's a little difficult
D	it's not necessarily the case that erm they open fully both ways so
A	mm
D	you know cos I've tried doing it on the inside
C	mm
D	and then it almost looks worse if there's a little stretch you can't get so you've got clean and then a revolting stripe
C	right
B	yes yeah then you're really aware of it
D	then you're suddenly
B	yes yeah
D	that they are
B	yeah whereas if they're just dirty
D	truly if they're just dirty
B	you actually in a way don't notice like
C	mm
B	glasses actually
C	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	I think you
B	yeah
C	just cos of the dogs
B	ah
C	cos the dogs are outside and they stick their noses up
B	oh
C	against the window or their paw
B	so there's all
C	and you know
D	is that one of
C	er yeah yeah occasionally we say oh yeah when you're it's on your list give the windows a good clean
B	they have a little list each do they?
C	mm yeah
B	I I mean do they have a standard list as it were?
C	mm mm yeah
B	one is responsible for
C	if they're back yeah
B	yeah
C	you know
B	yeah
C	er they both
B	yeah yeah
C	cos we don't go in it
B	no
C	and it's like well

B	yeah
C	the leftovers and a bit of
B	yeah
C	meal
B	mm well this is the cat that when they took him to the vet and the vet said oh I mean this is what after one of his erm meetings with er with battles that he lost sort of thing
C	mm
B	she said oh maybe I should give him some vitamins or something and then
B	she said
B	and
D	in German
B	but the you know the the
A	yeah
B	details about
C	a menu of what he eats yeah
B	it yes
C	yeah
B	and erm she said oh he certainly won't need vitamins
C	mm
B	you know if he's getting this quality of food
D	mm
A	but then I know cats who have been fed Whiskers all their life and they're aged twenty
D	yes but they wouldn't be as soft and they wouldn't smell of caramel

D	but er
A	yeah
D	he doesn't seem to buy them anything particularly special
A	yeah I don't think it's unproven whether it's necessary or not but
D	but then one of them's on a special diet
