B	yes
A	mm
C	you said drama practice
A	drum practice
C	I heard you say drama
A	hang on hang on what are you saying?
C	I heard you say drama
A	I said drum but you need to stop speaking with your mouth full cos it's not very nice is it?
B	mm
A	how much have you done?
B	how much what?
A	drumming are you in your own world of tiger bread eating at the moment?
B	erm
A	how much drum practice have you done?
B	not a lot
B	yeah but I will have more time
A	it's just that you keep asking me to help you and I don't have time to do it every single day
B	do you mean
A	mm
B	you're good
A	mm
B	you are great
A	I am great? I'm alright but I would be much better if I'd done my scales and arpeggios every day
B	even though I have absolutely no idea what you just said then
A	a scale is that going all the way up
B	yeah that's quite difficult
A	no you just you just erm you just get used to used to doing them but it's it has been useful to be able to read music than learning the drums
B	uhu
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah and then we'll do the circus on Monday I think because it's supposed to be horrible weather again
B	what circus you haven't actually told us what the
A	there's a big tent in the
B	oh
A	I really don't know about it erm I wonder what the advert says circus wonderland Britain's most magical circus so that's all they say
A	mm well yes that is exaggeration but I expect there will be clowns
B	oh no
A	I know but hopefully
B	clowns are scary
A	I know hopefully there will be people on the trapeze and the high wire and maybe there will be a hoop
C	people riding people riding horses
A	mm
B	that's animal cruelty
A	mm there is a website so I will go and have a look
B	I'd like it as a surprise mum
A	I would like it to be a surprise
C	mm
B	well
A	now there's erm
B	they do treat animals very meanly in the circus
A	not any more no they can't they are not allowed to
B	they still use the whips
A	no they don't how do you know?
B	because I read it in a book
A	which book?
B	Bart Simpson Big Shot
A	they are not allowed to do that sort of thing they are very very strict rules about animals these days I mean I would prefer to go to a circus that doesn't have animals in it and there might not be one might not be any
C	yeah
A	what
C	when a long time ago when we were at the
A	you went to one okay
C	there was a circus with no animals at all no lion taming no riding horses just
A	mm
C	no lion taming no horses just er just there wasn't just all
A	just what?
C	just people
A	just people
C	yeah
A	can you remember what they were doing?
C	well one person was climbing up a rope and attaching themself to it and it was like with a key or something and he actually untied himself with no hands
A	mm
B	is lion taming cruelty? when they go
A	yeah I think it is I mean if if they're well treated I don't think they do that now
B	because anyway you could die doing lion taming
A	yeah you can do if the animals turn and get nasty
B	you can die doing quite a lot of things in the circus
A	mm
C	like fire breathing
A	well you take special precautions for that kind of thing
B	being a tightrope and trapeze you can easily die
A	there's always a safety net underneath
C	can we see the bears?
A	can you see the bears? can you start talking with your mouth
C	can you please move the bear so I can see it?
A	yeah in a moment I'm eating at the moment what I was going to say was in the summer there is this juggling it's not just juggling but a a kind of a weekend in the
B	well did you say that's a week or a weekend?
A	just a weekend
B	mm well
A	you get to watch a lot of people do juggling as well
B	I did enjoy it our last holiday weekend we had
A	what was that one?
B	the one where we went to the
A	where?
B	the
A	oh when we went erm in
B	yeah you also like the smashing ice I feel that somebody should have hidden the key in there
A	mm
B	yeah
A	that would have been mean
B	the key is in the freezing cold water
A	now erm we are not so far away from this juggling thing so we could probably just go for one day
C	stay for one day
B	or maybe two if we decide that we like it a lot
A	mm mm that's a good way of thinking what do you think
C	pardon?
A	have you not been listening?
C	no
A	we are talking about the juggling weekend in the
C	okay
A	mm
B	and if we can't juggle that well
A	well I can't juggle at all
B	I want to repeatedly learn how to I want to learn how to repeatedly juggle three balls
C	I can do this with
A	don't talk over
C	I can catch one ball I can do two
B	can I have a slice of tiger bread?
A	mm
C	can I have two
A	that's a giant slice anyway isn't it
C	mm
B	it's one
A	mm I think they do lots of classes but they it's erm we would be just be going for one weekend but the the actual thing lasts for eleven days and then at the second weekend they do they put on a performance but you will be with dad that weekend and in fact I'm not around
B	eleven days?
A	what do you mean? mm that's a very odd way of thinking about it but yes
A	mm
B	it's more than a week though
A	it's nearly it's nearly two weeks isn't it?
B	yeah so you don't have three
C	mm mm
A	oh are you enjoying your tiger bread?
B	probably two
C	no
A	I think the thing about jugglers
B	I guess so
A	which is understandable
B	no erm because sometimes juggling can actually come in handy if you want because if there's something where you need to carry three balls across a big bridge but you're only able to hold hold one er two at a time and people would steal the
A	uhu
B	well not exactly that but it
A	it could do
B	if you didn't want to if you wanted to stop someone from getting a few things like you couldn't hold onto them you could juggle them and juggling also means you could hold more than one thing at more than two things at a time
A	it does indeed but also juggling is just very good anyway for balance and coordination patients determination all of those things
B	and trying not to get annoyed when the ball falls on the floor
A	indeed
