A	Volkswagen TD whatever
B	oh you
C	oh you could
B	it was a very sweet little van we got
C	it's always funny when you have a new car and you don't know where the bits are some of them have things inside that you
B	that you tweak yeah
C	open the outside on
A	mm yeah
B	yeah that's right
C	yeah
A	I found a switch inside it opened the bonnet
A	I saw the girl looking at me from the
C	yeah no you start to feel a bit self-conscious don't you?
A	inside the er the
C	I couldn't on the bike in Thailand I couldn't work out how to turn off the indicator
C	cos there's like a switch that you click
B	mm
C	to the right to turn it the right indicator on and vice versa and then how do you turn it off? you think you just flicked it back to the middle but it doesn't it just goes right indicator left indicator right indicator you know like
A	ah
B	ah
C	to turn it off yeah it took me ages it's the kind of thing you don't want to stop and ask someone
C	oh
B	er so that's a bit odd isn't it? you have to open the passenger door
A	I think it locks doesn't it? it it says on the cap it's a locking cap
B	so but what was happening so I dad and I met at
C	mm
B	er and bought a toasty and a coffee and I got in his passenger side and it so I I didn't have a lot of room so I was kind of squeezing out and every time I squeezed out I opened the petrol cap and so every time I went to close the door it wouldn't close cos the petrol cap wasn't in
A	ah
C	mm
B	erm so I'd realised but it's a bit daft cos if you're the only driver then you have to go round open the passenger door
C	yeah
B	to open the petrol cap it's a bit weird isn't it?
C	very weird these Germans you expect more from them
B	I was listening were you listening?
A	it a Volkswagen diesel as well
C	I saw that it was a Volkswagen
A	polluting the country
C	yeah
B	were you listening to the Volkswagen programme?
C	guilty
A	yes
B	I was thought you would be
C	on Radio four
B	it was interesting
A	it was interesting wasn't it?
B	they were saying that Volkswagen really was quite a corrupt company really is what they were saying weren't they?
A	yeah
B	erm or not corrupt but that it was
A	it was a family business
B	the it was a family business and you needed a board that that would question what was happening so
C	I see yeah
B	they all they were all saying you know what do you think happened and they said they all the panel all agreed they were all experts that erm everybody on the board would need to just ask the question so you have somehow very cheaply managed to make the engines do this
A	much less emissions
B	much less emissions how did you do it?
A	yeah
B	erm and they didn't ask that question
A	evidently wasn't asked
C	oh I see because everyone's on the inside type of thing
B	erm yeah exactly so everybody just said oh great they've done it cheaply let's just go with that
C	I'd be surprised if you investigated any company that you wouldn't find all sorts of things going on
B	yeah
C	I mean I don't
B	I I liked what these people were saying they were saying the the the roll of the board is to keep a check that the checks and balances of you know balancing out making the profit against running ethically and all of those things
C	ethical things yeah
B	erm and that was all the board so they all just basically said you know where does the buck lie?
A	who's responsible? well yeah they said that that the board is responsible
B	er but every engineer in the in the company
A	must have known
B	has to know
A	yeah
B	that you're you've put a part in that does this thing you know maybe the people actually fitting the part don't know it but all of the engineers know
C	mm
B	so it's er it's dire but they seemed to also say which I thought was really interesting and quite good that they didn't actually think that any other companies were doing it that they were all you know
A	yes BMW were fine
B	cheating on their emissions slightly and that there were gonna be big repercussions for diesel cars but erm nobody was actually in this terrible situation of just lying
B	cheating basically
C	cheating the system yeah
B	so the the thing was er erm they were set this task to meet the emissions levels that the Americans wanted and all of the other car manufacturers came up with engineering solutions that cost a lot of money and therefore their cars were dearer the performance wasn't quite a good and other factors came in but they met the criteria
C	mm mm
B	whereas they just cheated and so they were really popular cos everybody thought well you can get this cheap
C	affordable yeah
B	affordable clean system
B	oh oh oh oh
C	it's damaging isn't it? for the brand the whole thing
B	terrible
A	damaging for the made in Germany brand
C	agreed agreed yeah
A	there was a German on the panel wasn't it?
C	it sort of makes you reflect doesn't it?
B	yeah there was a German on the panel
A	that's what he said it's damaging for the made in Germany brand
B	mm
C	mm I agree with that puts the whole thing in question a bit
B	erm
A	are you alright my lovey?
B	have we got another box of tissues?
C	both of you are a disaster
A	well it was
B	well it
A	he he was in a chronic state

B	no but whereas with
C	for the count
B	and he's you know he's really wheezing
C	oh he'll be coughing all winter yeah
B	it's an awful thing
C	that'll happen
B	but he did make me laugh cos he does take it all very much to heart
B	erm so he wasn't sure he'd be well enough blah blah for the party
C	did you get reduced fat cookies?
B	oh please
C	what are you doing that for?
B	tell me I didn't
C	I mean
B	I didn't know
C	it's a disaster
A	are they reduced fat?
C	they're reduced fat all butter
A	reduced fat cookies
B	how do you do that?
C	which seems to be a contradiction in terms I'll have to eat one anyway
A	there's probably an app in the making process
B	you'd better test them
A	an app to reduce the fat when it's being tested
B	so he manages the party and you know is chatting enjoying himself in chatted with everybody all evening you know had a few glasses but didn't overdo it in his term and erm
B	and then you know maybe about eleven he sort of said oh I think I'll have to go to bed now so you know that's unusual for him but it wasn't like nine o'clock or eight o'clock where he's hardly had any fun at all so he went to bed a little bit early and then er he got up the next day and he he said I was going to go to A erm
C	to the A and E?
B	to A and E I said
A	A and E with a hangover
B	and chatting

A	all butter cookies
B	yeah they were
C	were so good did you not like them that much?
B	no I did
C	I was like wow
B	I don't think I got many dad pretends he doesn't like biscuits
C	dad had it all
B	but
C	well you packed some for me on the train
B	was that a nice little lunch
C	yeah it was cool it was really fun actually that train journey because it was
B	oh did everything go okay? you didn't get accosted?
C	nobody checked my ticket so that was a relief
B	we love those people
C	and erm I changed in
B	I've done that journey a few times
C	have you?
B	mm
C	no way?
B	when I was doing my choir from
C	well it's really slow till like
B	and then it's pretty damn speedy isn't it? and
C	it was good
B	and quite quite nice you know? I'd have a table seat and
C	yeah that's what I did
B	I did something
C	working
B	mm
C	and erm yeah and productive quite productive and it was completely full when I got on cos people commute from the
B	mm mm yes yes
C	so all of those people were going home so I didn't have a seat at the beginning but after one or two stops it was all fine
B	oh
A	so the er
C	even travelling to
A	yeah you don't surprise me
C	thing as well
A	so the car hire guy sent a whole series of instructions you needed to register with the DVLC and get a code so that they could access your driving license details
C	mm
A	and you had to produce independent evidence of identity
C	crikey
A	so I went with all of this this morning didn't want any of it
B	he just gave you the key
A	gave him my driving license there you are keys
A	didn't
C	so they're coming here tomorrow to pick the car up?
A	oh yeah we're we phoned them specially to
C	mm
A	cos we didn't fancy getting up at seven o'clock to get to
C	oh god
B	I have to say that we realised it was the same company that I had used when we first moved here
C	oh funny
B	and by complete fluke and coincidence and they had
C	leave the key in?
B	yeah
C	are you serious?
B	and erm
C	mm
B	so I was like oh dear something's gone wrong we're going to be charged
C	they'll charge me mm
B	erm and er no they didn't come the whole weekend they came on the Sunday evening or something
A	didn't need
B	I suppose they just didn't need it and they just picked it up whenever
A	cost twenty pounds twenty pounds for them to collect it
B	oh imagine
C	hundred percent worth it
B	hundred percent I'd given them heaps of money to collect it tomorrow so we don't have to
A	well it's sort of thirty miles that's sixty miles
C	yeah the petrol is
B	and two people
A	and we need two cars
B	they need two people to come
A	no I'm I'm saying that
C	no I'm saying if you went
A	it would have cost us
B	oh god yeah
A	it would have cost us two cars
C	yeah and an early morning which is exactly what you don't need
A	well I can't just leave it with the keys in
B	no not unless you were told to
A	how come you've got all snuffley? you you said you were better after a day
B	I know it came back
A	you were all being brave
C	have you taken vitamin C?
B	is there any vitamin C?
B	I've been taking some of that
C	you've got to take the er million a thousand milligrams vitamin Cs when you get a cold as soon as you have the first symptom
B	you have to whap it oh
C	yeah take loads of it I'm not sure if it works or not
A	sounds like a bit of old wives to me
C	no it's not old wives I mean it's
B	it's New Age
C	it's not New Age either everyone takes vitamin C and echinacea when they have a cold
A	everyone?
B	even
C	if you go into Boots in the winter there's like a whole aisle dedicated to vitamin C pills
B	there is
C	so not I don't think it's old wives I think there's some scientific evidence
B	it's no there's some
A	sounds like old wives to me
C	boosts your immune system
B	I just can't stop
C	that's grim so what about
A	yes bit of a trial really
C	yeah sounds like a mission
A	the whole episode
C	you've done it now
A	first morning we were thinking we were going to have to leave half the house the guy sent a text message
B	oh I didn't tell
A	from main office saying we will collect only the following items
B	everything that was on
A	everything else will be left behind
C	oh god see they should have made that more clear shouldn't they?
B	I said what sort of removals company gets list from a family home and doesn't question that you haven't put any ornaments or pictures on it
C	yeah exactly
B	and doesn't just say do you have ornaments and pictures?
C	yeah they should have I mean it's their responsibility as well isn't it? mm
A	anyway not to worry
C	panic yeah it's all fine isn't it?
B	we panicked and they he was in a meeting for an hour and a half so we had to wait to ring him up and then we rang him up and he said he just said oh it's fine as long as it goes on the van it'll be fine
A	which it didn't
B	but it didn't and he hadn't sent any erm equipment to wrap pictures they have special bags or them
C	yeah
A	the first thing was the er did mum tell you the lorry couldn't get up the drive
C	I know that's awful
A	so the first thing he did we just saw them trying back in and there was crunching going on and they
B	and wrecked all the
A	wrecked the boarding at the front of the house
A	and there's nothing surer than the new
C	bless you
B	sorry
A	owner will object
C	oh no
A	and then it was torrential rain for the whole day and they were trudging up and down
B	two days rain wasn't it?
A	furniture in the rain so it was very
C	that's a disaster
A	very er
C	it's just a fraught thing overall isn't it? moving there's a lot of stress
B	it's a bit stressful it's always stressful
C	yeah
A	moving house
C	ooh bless you mum
A	oh my goodness what's going on here?
B	sorry
C	oh mum
A	is it the wine?
C	you need to the wine
B	I'm allergic to wine
C	you need to have erm some
A	a thousand milligrams of vitamin C
A	I'd like you to google it
C	oh dad
A	are you sure?
B	I've been like this all the time in the car what's going on?
A	we have been walking around in the rain all day that's not good for colds either
C	yeah that's true
A	so are you off tomorrow?
C	I'm off tomorrow
A	oh oh are you flying tomorrow
C	just to add to the things to do yes I'm flying at nine thirty PM
A	from
C	from
C	really oddly
B	as long as there aren't any hajj followers
A	you'll be joining the
B	ambling about you'll be alright
B	it will
A	Birmingham Indian Pakistanis
C	they have really Birmingham accents that's what's really funny
B	I know sort of
A	did you did you hear the Pakistani guy on the comedy tonight?
B	I did I couldn't be bothered with it
A	it was very boring really wasn't it?
B	I turned it off yeah I turned it off till he was over
A	yeah
C	what was he saying?
A	Sammy
C	Google Chrome has stopped working why? why do you stop working? why?
C	you don't really need you ticket these days in an airport it's just for the sake of
B	I
C	so have you have you cleared it with
B	I don't know I haven't looked at my phone for a while
C	I would check just in case you have to go at ten
B	she's not going to make me go at ten
C	she might do
B	mm
C	just
A	deary me what to do
C	it doesn't really look like a ticket that it's just kind of
B	I've put the TP-Link in somewhere I haven't the smallest idea what
A	which er which consignment was that then?
B	well
A	is that going to Edinburgh or Macclesfield or?
C	erm
B	it's gone into the so originally we had a
A	I thought there was a bird behind me
C	yeah it's weird isn't it? I'd be sitting there and you know forget that I'm gonna that I've print like and suddenly
A	sorry my love what were you saying?
B	erm I don't know I don't think it was very interesting
C	occasionally and in a weird way the BBC News twenty-four theme tune comes starts playing out of something over there
B	comes
A	yes that's right yeah
C	what is it?
B	erm it's dad he has alerts
C	dup dup dup
B	he has BBC alerts
A	BBC alerts switched on
B	and they they come in at all hours you know something is breaking news
B	the BBC is turned into a
C	the BBC has landed
B	Big Brother
A	there's a funny another funny thing I had wasn't it? where it
B	what was that?
A	you know we have I have the erm what's it called the voice?
B	Siri
A	Siri Siri switched itself on sometimes I didn't quite get that what did you say?
C	oh I see
B	I was having a funny day where I was putting everything that that was on the floor went into my pockets
C	you need a little bin next to you there mum for the tissues
A	your mother's been in hyper mode for about a week
B	oh
C	yeah I can imagine hyper mode
B	I couldn't sleep you know what it's just there was nothing to worry about but I just wake up at three like ping and can't go back to sleep and I'm not even worried
A	now how about
B	I'm just thinking
A	how about this one
C	no they're a bit rubbish those people aren't they?
B	and
B	I've already found everything out from somebody else
A	we believe they might still be buying the house
C	Pickford's
A	Pickford's
C	did I not tell you? yeah Pickford's oh yeah wanted a quote on your removal but it's already been and gone
A	I ignored I ignored them cos they were so poor so slow I just ignored the mails after that
C	mm they just wanted to take you off their list so I said yeah do that
B	aye
C	yeah they were really slow that's bad isn't it?
A	yeah what was it any any van
B	any van
A	any van that was a complete disaster weren't they? any van were you there when I was doing that?
C	what yeah the van thing?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	you have to commit yourself to thousands of pounds before you knew who it was that was going to do it
C	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard of
B	are you are you going to start sneezing and snuffling
C	don't give me anything
B	you were coughing in the night
A	I've been coughing yeah
B	it was waking me up
C	yeah
A	I
C	mm
C	International
B	mm
B	Pakistani blah
B	to
C	I wanted you to oversee my packing
B	oh
C	but it's too late now I just followed your example
B	oh good girl
C	I've got quite a lot of stuff I've got I've
B	yes and erm
C	cos I can take that as hand luggage I can actually take two bags of twenty-three kilos on the flight but it just any onward flight won't have the same generosity
B	that's the trouble
B	that's I've
C	so what I can take twenty-three kilos to India and just leave it there but it's not a good place to store things
B	no I did this whole ludicrous things going to Spain
C	mm
B	that we went with Jet two and we came back with Ryanair
C	yeah it's a mistake
B	it was all in a package but
C	yeah
A	yeah that's true yeah
B	but erm Jet two have one load of nice
A	one set of rules
C	oh no Jet two give you a free bag and Ryanair
B	exactly
C	mm
B	erm and you go oh jolly nice and then you realise you've got to come back with Ryanair and you've got no chance
A	paid for everything with Ryanair
B	and so I we'd done everything we could to sort of squash everything into the two bags and they have a strict no hand luggage no
A	oh gosh yeah yeah
C	yeah they have a strict everything
B	nothing in your hand not even a
A	I remember there were some rage
B	and I was going mad at you
A	you were going mad at me cos I what did I do? put something in the
B	you had cameras and everything all over the place
B	and erm anyway we finally managed to get it into two bags and a
C	oh jols that doesn't happen ever
B	and we were like yes
A	as you do
C	you weren't fretting were you mum?
A	lots of fretting going on
C	can't imagine you fretting
C	never seen that before
B	oh
C	fourteen forty-five from
B	yeah
C	change at
B	yeah
C	some of them are direct but they're not really ideally timed arriving at
B	sounds good
C	cos the next one is an hour later and then it's nineteen nineteen and if it's delayed
B	oh no yeah
C	then I'm cutting it fine I mean
B	it's great that it's
C	I'd rather be there
B	yeah
C	to be honest and just be like having a coffee or something
B	and it's it's dinner time so you could have a little
C	have dinner yeah exactly
B	something couldn't you? find somewhere nice to eat there's a Pret
C	I do have you been there? no you were at Leeds Bradford mum it's different
B	no I was at
C	oh you've done both
A	you know
B	there's a Pret in
C	I've never been to
B	there's a Pret it's
C	I like Pret and erm usually these small airports are quite fine they
B	it just has a nice big concourse with everything around
C	have a Boots or whatever
B	and you just sit in the one little place
C	mm
B	and that's it but
C	yeah that's nice
B	and there's just little corridors off
C	I can't be dealing with where did I fly there's two places I don't like airports
A	only two?
C	there's a few airports I don't like
B	Houston's gotta rate right
C	Heathrow
B	oh yeah
A	Heathrow is horrible
C	is a nightmare
A	yeah
C	erm I was there like on a stopover of some kind and I just was like get me out of here it was so busy and it was like this massive hall
A	yeah it's very stressful isn't it?
C	with like so many things going on
A	yeah yeah
C	and nowhere to really have a
A	and you know they have this and they have they have this really cool system where they put your bag down and it's like a little railway and then it goes along and then it it there's a fork in the railway and if it goes down the wrong side that means bad news
B	you're going to be checked
A	they're going to make you wait
C	yeah
A	half an hour
C	the security there is horrible
A	because they found that you've got a bottle top in your handbag or something
C	yeah no exactly they're so over the top with the security
A	I it's infuriating
B	I've never told anyone this
A	what?
B	that last time
A	are you wagging your finger?
B	I'm wagging my finger because I was so cross I've never ever known anything like it
A	I left my Iphone in the
B	erm Ipad and computer in the bag and didn't take it out how long has he been travelling? he knows
C	oh dad you've got to take the Ipad out
B	and he just said oh they stop you anyway and they don't
A	er actually in fact truth be told
C	truth be told
A	er I had got into a habit of doing that because the
C	yeah well this is the thing in England is the worst for that
B	but
C	was this is
B	I don't know where we were but you'd deliberately left your computer in
A	no it wasn't
B	and he
B	was well they just stop and check me every time so I may as well just do it
C	oh no no
B	but if you've left your computer in
C	play the game
B	they know that you're being annoying so they they put him through three times
A	yeah
B	we were there a good half an hour I went straight through
A	they had a sniffer dog come out
B	picked my bag up he
B	and it's because he deliberately left it in you know if he's just taken it out and put it in the tray like everybody else we'd have been alright
C	yeah dad
B	yeah dad
A	there was one super
B	we'd have to leave at four with the children
C	we'd have to take the children
B	yeah and take them it's just not worth it
C	no it doesn't matter at all I just wondered if it was a
B	no
A	there was one super stressful event I in Frankfurt airport
B	was I there?
A	no you weren't there
B	thank god
A	and I took my computer out put it through in X-ray machine and forgot to pick it up again
B	oh oh
A	and then I was
B	oh oh oh oh oh
A	in I was sort of
C	er yes yes yes yes
A	enormous airport and I wandered about a mile to find the the business lounge and then went into the business lounge oh no computer
C	oh dad
B	he his
A	and
C	panic
A	and it was a complete panic erm of course it wasn't there it had been picked up
C	oh gosh
A	and it was in the lost property office which was about four miles away on the escalators and the time was ticking away and I basically had to wait while he got on his tractor and went to
C	oh dad
A	and it was about five seconds to spare to get on the plane
C	oh god actually
A	did he?
C	he left his passport and ticket in the trolley
A	oh oh
C	and walked off and I mean he's never done that before he's not like you know it's not like a regular event like it is for me
A	mm
C	and erm you know? that's a panic moment right there er went to Lufthansa and they some nice person had just handed it in to them
A	yeah
C	very lucky I mean you would if you found a passport you'd go and give it to someone wouldn't you? but you know he just sent me a text message like slightly panicky moment left my passport on the trolley
A	yeah
B	mm
C	I'm completely erm panic panicking in airports with those things
B	I am
