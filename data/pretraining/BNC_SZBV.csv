A	that we got some
B	we had
A	yeah
B	with the child-minding
A	yes
A	they were good
B	yeah but it doesn't really
A	well that's to stop you strangling someone
B	they thought everyone was
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well I think now I know why they give them to you cos the meeting
B	probably it it was it was pretty awful weren't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	they're all a waste of time and they're all money-making games that they play
B	I can't believe you have to pay for first aid and
A	yeah
B	stuff now all the courses you have to pay
A	yeah well
B	apparently
A	yeah
B	they they always did write it up didn't they in in the book
A	yeah
B	they wrote it up like forty pound a course didn't they?
A	they did yeah
B	but then they said it was free to you
A	yeah
B	but it's obviously
A	not free any more
B	getting ready to get the money coming in
A	yeah but that you see the problem is with these organisations they have the people with the hats on who come and give you a talk that get paid an awful lot of money don't they?
B	mm
A	they get paid an awful lot of money we do it all because we
B	yeah
A	and you go to these meetings and listen to them rabbiting on about a load of rubbish and they're getting paid all that money
B	and what they've been
A	big nurseries yeah that's all they want yeah
B	that's not so good for the children
A	no
B	I think
A	yeah
B	just have the one person looking after her little one
A	but I'm glad we don't do it any more
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	she's going to be better off isn't she?
A	she is yeah
B	she's going to be really well off if if it works out well
A	yeah

A	well she said she was going to
B	well she no cos she keeps keep on mentioning it
A	no I didn't no I didn't I just asked her if she had and I was then going to say to you I don't think it would be worth it
