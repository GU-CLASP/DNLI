A	okay so what do you think about
B	I think it's utter nonsense
A	what? all religion? everything about it?
B	erm
A	everything even though
B	well I think I think most religions have a good cause but I think
A	there's Muslim organisations
B	most religions have a good cause and I think that's probably why they were invented probably just for a good cause I I can see why I can see how it's good
B	erm but
B	I'm not doing anything
A	okay
B	erm but I think some people do go quite far and I think that is really kind of sad that people like nuns they like completely devote their whole life they don't see their family
A	no but they choose to and who are you to say that that's not a good choice for them?
B	eh
A	my
B	erm
A	she's like head of the nuns the church nuns
B	mm
A	she seemed to enjoy it
B	yeah well I just don't believe it
A	it isn't the same as saying erm well
B	I don't know what's best for other people
A	yeah but you're saying that nuns have a hard time
B	ah no I'm just saying I don't think all nuns I think all the if they really really but I don't think all nuns do it because they like waking up every morning obeying to these very strict rules they kind of they might do it to not
A	but none of us will ever know that will we?
B	mm
B	I don't know I think we'll I think we'll be able to know if it's true or not soon
B	cos we'll be able to bring people back to life in the next hundred years maybe
B	I I think we will
A	back to life?
B	like if it's if it's of a natural like heart stop working
A	okay I would imagine
A	hey hey I'd imagine they'd have no memory so we'd still wouldn't know whether there is there is a heaven or not
B	mm
A	yummy
C	dog
A	bye look bye
B	it's just I don't think there's
A	six
C	six
B	I think a lot of people just say there just is a heaven there just is with no evidence behind it
B	there just is a heaven
B	I understand why people believe in heaven
A	uh oh
B	because death is scary
B	I'm not going to try and make people not believe in heaven because I don't want them to be sad about death or anything
A	mm
B	but in my opinion I don't think it's true and I'm not going to I can't really think that it is true because
A	mm
B	I don't think it's true
A	mm
B	I don't see any evidence in the whole world which can tell me any of it's true
A	mm
B	I think there probably might have been a man called Jesus or I don't know what his name was Jesus or whatever erm he was just like talking the word of god but I don't think he came back to life I don't think he survived forty days without food or water cos I'm pretty sure that's impossible that's more than a month so you'd literally die
A	maybe he was being he was
B	but the word of god would have to be made out of lush lush water
A	I don't know
B	I'm not saying there is or isn't a god I'm thinking it's very
A	so you'd you wouldn't believe in heaven but you might believe there's some mad people up there using us as a project?
B	erm I think
A	that doesn't make sense to me
B	in two billion years from now we could probably have the technology to create a solar system I'm saying that so if
A	mm mm
B	but and then and that first person would have survived two billion years before us and then they another like six trillion or whatever then we might have found out how to make a solar system
A	yeah but you're talking about
B	yeah but I just think a lot of people see god as like I think if there was a god
A	hey stop doing that that's too loud
B	sorry
B	sorry
B	say sorry
B	sorry
A	spaghetti
A	there you go
C	wow
A	wow
B	erm I think if there was a god I think there'd be no use praying to god because if there was a god I doubt it would be erm
C	wow
A	no no but do you see what I'm saying? if you're saying yeah I don't
B	sorry
A	no I'm saying that your
B	no no no please let me finish that god is a thing that people can talk to and pray to by putting their hands together and somehow talking to him wherever he is and and he answers their prayers even though there's about seven billion people on the planet probably about two of those probably at least one billion are praying at that time I don't know not one billion praying at that very time but a lot so yes I don't think he is listen to all of those at the same time if he was real
B	it's it's always a god of
B	I don't think he'd be I don't think he or she or it would
B	be smart like like us humans it just would've created I don't think it would have
B	or I don't think it would think I just think it would be existence like the universe it just existed
A	so is that what you believe?
B	it's not what I believe
A	so what do you believe?
B	I believe I don't know what to believe
B	I don't believe in
A	achoo
B	I don't believe in religion anyway
C	oh oh
A	oh look
B	in a way I believe
C	ah
A	ah
B	in a way I in a way I believe in my own religion that there was that there was just something that just existed and then just our universe was created under different circumstances we could create life and then we were created or dinosaurs and all that and then we were eventually created
A	but from what?
B	I don't know I never said any
A	but what what happened before before the universe then what was? what created the universe?
B	I don't know I don't think anyone knows for sure
A	I can understand a bit more of that thinking where you're you're thinking maybe more scientifically if there isn't evidence then you're not
B	but I don't believe in Scientology cos Scientology is crazy
A	science is nothing to do with Scientology it's just their names are similar
B	you know Scientology believes that there was an alien mothership called Glorgon that like had a whole thing created the Earth and all that stuff
A	they they called themselves Scientologists to try and give themselves a kind of credence
A	but erm but yeah
B	you should look up
A	ah better
B	I believe in science though
A	yeah I mean that's kind of what I believe as well
B	cos I I
A	just to
C	ten
A	yeah ten very good
B	it's no that was just me saying that it could be possible that we're just a creation of something else that has been created by something or whatever but
A	yeah but you could you we could all have a theory and that all are untested and nobody would know and
B	exactly I'm not saying it's true I'm saying that's what that's why I don't believe it because I was saying it's possible but I don't believe in it
A	aha
B	which is what I'm saying which I guess you could say is the same thing as just saying I don't believe in religion
A	no it's not the same thing
A	well I mean it doesn't mean that all religion is bad though is it?
B	I never said that
A	I'm alright you don't have to get defensive all I'm asking is
B	not really I know a bit it's a bit crazy Islam as well
B	apparently their god
C	yum
B	their god Allah the one and only god
C	yum yum
A	mm
B	Allah the one and only god which can't be depicted told erm told Muhammed to go er go and kill his child on top of a mountain
A	yeah well so did Christianity
B	mm?
A	it's the same thing Muhammed
B	yeah I know I'm not saying I'm not saying Christianity is any less weird than Islam
A	yeah
B	I'm just saying they're all weird in my eyes
A	yeah
B	mm mm not really
A	no?
B	no
A	do you have any friends? like is anybody at school a Muslim?
B	yeah
A	who's who's a Muslim at your school?

A	yeah but is he in your year? or your class?
B	yeah he's in my class
A	okay does he have many friends there?
B	kind of
A	do you think it's hard for him? being the only Muslim boy?
B	I don't know
A	where's he from?
B	erm
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	you could talk to him one day if nobody else talks to him
B	I have talked to him
A	yeah? does he talk back?
B	kind of yeah just because he's mum I think you think this is erm if he's quiet and he doesn't talk very much you think he's instantly a great friend
B	sorry it's just cos
A	you just don't know
B	I do make an effort with everyone
A	yeah well fair enough okay
B	it's just you've got to be kind of open to other people as well
A	so there are there any other people in your school with other religions?
B	I guess so
A	do you I mean do you know of any?
B	not really
A	any Buddhists or anything else at all?
B	no not really
A	do you know anything about the Jehovah's Witnesses or?
B	no
A	do you get taught about other religions at your school or is it all about Christianity?
B	no we get taught about other things
A	well what? what kind of things do you get taught then?
B	eh Islam Buddhism Hinduism Christianity
