B	oh I'm sorry
A	yeah oh well but erm it's not the same hospital erm so yeah and catching up on er on everybody mm and erm I asked about erm you know that er DBS thing
B	well they're probably not there to er she's a policewoman is she?
A	I think so or she might be might just work in the office I don't know
B	amazing
A	but you'd think they'd reply I know she only came back from holiday last week but after a week you know?
B	well some things never get expunged and that's it
A	well okay but at least they had the would have the decency to reply
B	decency yeah well if they were decent people they wouldn't become policemen would they?
B	let's be honest there's more corruption and
A	well
B	no
A	but she she worked for them you know? erm and I said have you have you still got any contacts and she said well I have but I

B	you're welcome
A	yeah so
B	a stamp?
A	well yes the equivalent of a stamp and erm er well like National Insurance er for a pension but it's er erm and you have to all all the obligatory things that you have to pay er and it's all tied to your
B	right
A	so when I was last saw her when I was last in
B	right
A	because I mean I thought it's the least I could do
B	so how old is
A	well she must be about er
B	so when do women in France get their pensions?
A	I don't know I don't know I'd and I said well that's crazy because you know she should have been receiving quite good money because of all the years the eighteen years that we paid into this
B	yeah but if you haven't er
A	well I haven't
B	reached retirement age there she won't get anything surely?
A	but women always retire earlier don't they? I mean what is it sixty? is it
B	yeah but here it's gone up
A	is it sixty?
B	it may have gone up there
A	well maybe maybe but er I might and that's that's what I wanted to talk to her about you know
A	well I can get cheap flights now erm I'm on
B	yes
A	and you get standby flights and you get them really cheaply like when I came back from China
B	yes
A	sixty quid
B	yes
A	it cost me more to pay for my second bag
B	yes
A	than it did for the flight back
B	yes
A	so I I can
B	unbelievable
A	I know isn't it? but erm I
B	yes
A	and it was I I went through the arcade and when you get the outside the other
B	yes
A	erm lovely lady and er she's only been doing the job for a few weeks
B	yes
A	and cos I've done that job twice you know before director of studies and er she was er she was the one it is quite a small school but erm er she was all
B	mm
A	and basically er it's to start with and I I didn't really expect any more actually but er they they don't know from one week to another how many students they've got and she said she said I think I'm she does it on Thursday her schedule for the following week and she said is that alright and if I just phone you up and say well can you do this or can you do that? and I said yeah I said er because it would be good to get back into the swing of teaching again you know cos er I haven't taught for a few months and er to do something positive the the pay is pretty low but just to to get back into it would be good and obviously you know to to get out and meet people you know as well as you know teaching so unusual afternoon really
B	mm
A	and er quite positive in some ways
B	yeah I suppose so
A	you mean you mean you didn't?
B	it's very tiring
A	oh I know you were absolutely exhausted
B	possibly I don't know
A	I'm sure no I'm sure I mentioned to you last night you know and you seem really wound up like a spring you know all tension there but you see
B	was I?
A	yeah lately and you seem much more relaxed today
B	well it's probably diet that's what it is
A	do you reckon?
B	yeah yeah sure yeah diet with with erm with er diabetics
A	well you only you only started it today will it take effect already?
B	well look how quickly a drink takes effect but it's it's just stuff you put in your body isn't it?
A	or don't
B	what?
A	or don't put in your body
B	or don't er put in your body that's it isn't it? I mean
A	yeah
B	camomile tea was a good idea
A	here's here's to your your diet
B	oh yes cheers
A	cheers
A	I think you're a very brave chap doing all three things that are more or less at the same time giving up smoking giving up drinking more
B	yes thank you
A	and erm and now your your diet but you're it's it's it's not only wise I mean it's more than wise it's absolutely necessary isn't it? especially the diet
B	but I think one of the biggest things is stopping smoking
A	was it?
B	and the next one is diet and the next one is drinking
A	well
B	those are the orders I'm I'm putting it in difficulty for me
A	yeah you're you're into your third week now of giving up smoking
B	I quite liked smoking
A	yeah I know but you haven't made a big deal of it
A	mm mm
B	so but it's the thing that I do enjoy smoking
A	mm
B	but erm
A	but you you don't
B	but then again I don't and there's too many things that I when I smoke it depresses me it's depressing
A	yeah you you don't usually do things in half measures do you? you whatever you do you usually put everything into it and that includes the vices as well as work and and and
B	yes you could say that
A	virtues and everything really is er
B	yeah
A	so you're not you weren't a chain smoker but sometimes not far off
B	that's true
A	it was it was just one after another wasn't it?
B	it's true
A	I mean look when I brought that carton back for you
B	oh that's fatal but I'd be the same with a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine or
A	I started so I'll finish
B	it's called dipsomania
A	here's to intemperance oh no my glass is nearly empty
B	oh
A	well I like to er
B	yeah go on twist my arm
A	I like to
B	who this is your perfect morning?
A	well it's my ideal type of day
B	right
A	and I get up when I don't need any more sleep
B	yes
A	and then do something useful er if I can for most of the day I mean like today I was meeting somebody job interview coming back doing my CV you know?
B	yes
A	and I've only just stopped now right? so now I feel like well it's the end of the day I deserve a drink
B	mm erm no I think it's a dangerous thing really to think like that I think I believe that
A	well it doesn't have to I mean it's that's it's not it's only lately that er
B	I'm saying no you asked me a question
A	yeah
A	yeah okay
B	but it was your you'd earnt it or that you know or what
A	yeah something like that
B	so erm
A	really?
B	and I have to and because I have er trouble with my liver and I've been warned that if I drink it would kill me if I went back to drinking because I'm quite on the edge of drinking and I still drink a bit but
A	mm
B	I'd much rather say oh well
A	yeah
B	and rather than to
B	kick myself and say well I've earned this I justify this I don't you know I have to say this makes me this is this takes away some of my pain
A	you'll go blind
B	well I'm just going to do it until I need glasses
B	absolutely
A	I've never known anybody with so many glasses as you've got
B	I know
A	and colours
B	I know well my glasses
A	how
B	no well basically I use two strengths of glasses I use one point oh I use I think one point fives for work and if I need to look at something really close up in detail I need two point fives and then I have different eye glasses and hand glasses to to erm magnifying glasses to see what I'm doing at different levels if I need to really look at something really intricately erm so all my glasses are in doubles I've got a white pair of one point fives and a white pair of two point fives and because I buy them at the Pound Shop
A	ah
B	they only cost me a pound a pair and
A	really?
B	I so I use them also as fashion fashionable
A	fashion statements
B	I like them fashion statements so I've got white ones I've got erm all different types of ones in both sizes then I've got the ones like like I'm holding in my hands these Big Al like ones that someone had that worked for me but er they had them at a dinner party and said er I like your glasses I'll swap you mine for yours and okay and and I've also got another pair of glasses that I bought for a pound or two pounds and they're Specsaver glasses and probably cost a hundred quid from the market for two quid that er are in my strength but what happens is with my type of work that I do I scratch damage break or lose quite a considerable amount of glasses
A	mm
B	and so the amount of glasses I'm probably looking at monetarily in terms probably if I said fifteen pounds it would probably be too much and probably probably you're looking at about ten pounds so it's ten pounds twelve quid
A	I wouldn't have thought you'd have got through all that many pair pairs of glasses being a male escort?
B	well it depends on what you're doing
B	it depends what you're doing you know? I I don't have eyes in the back of my head but it
A	so then you'd wear two pairs of glasses?
B	if that's what you're thinking yeah so that that's it really
A	I'm gonna go to
B	have you?
A	erm
B	yes
A	charity shop business
B	well good luck just remember to get the save the good stuff for me
A	I'll give you
B	and when I come in give it to me cheap
A	yeah I'll give you a call
B	alright? I'm gonna find out when you're on the till and I'll come in there and you give me a you say oh that's a quid that's that much alright okay?
B	well done
A	charity begins at home
B	mm that's why they should be called charity shops
A	well the
B	interesting
A	the little I've found out about this so far is that there's normally a manager or manageress gets paid
B	oh yeah
A	and the rest are volunteers
B	right well the managers are paid quite well I believe
A	are they?
B	so I believe
A	it's funny that cos I I went to the other one erm
B	oh yeah
A	and I haven't heard anything from them
B	yeah well that's strange isn't it?
A	yeah
B	what did you leave? did you leave a er?
A	well I just left a form but it wasn't so detailed as
B	no
A	oh you're operating on your hand?
B	yeah I'm cutting open my hand with a penknife to get a rather large wooden splinter out that has gone septic in my hand but they say that's the best thing you can do with wood to let it go septic and the pus forms around the wood and when you squeeze it just pops out which has just happened here it just has popped out oh my god that's a long one look I don't know how good your
A	oh my eyes are useless
B	really?
A	yeah
B	god that's just come out of my hand here you are put that on and have a look
B	sorry?
A	it's just blur
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	oh yeah with if I don't wear glasses up close it's fine it is big isn't it?
B	mm that was in my finger
A	almost a thorn rather than a splinter
B	really yeah yeah no but it was yeah it looks like a thorn but it is a it is a splinter oh it was sort of paining me that was
A	paining
B	so what are you going to do with your life?
A	well I could define that
B	right
A	mm I think I'm I'm moving in an upward direction of course it oscillates from day to day but generally it's it's getting better and er
B	yeah
A	I finished my my last antidepressant last night and
B	oh right
A	I'm due to go to the doctor on Thursday so
B	yeah
A	it'll be interesting to see if two days without them has any effect
B	do you think they have helped you?
A	I don't know because unless I go without them there won't be any way to compare if it's natural or not
B	don't you remember what you were like before you started taking them?
A	I certainly do but is that due to the pills or your help and
B	I don't know right but they know there you go then
A	er but I'll I'll certainly get some more
B	will you?
A	oh yeah yeah
B	what even if you feel okay?
A	well if I don't get any more I I mean I can do an experiment right? er and go without them and see if there's any difference if there's no difference then I can do without them but
B	right
A	if I slip back into it again
B	yeah
A	I'll I'll need them on hand as it were
B	I'm with you
A	no but I that's not
B	well ask the doctor's advice is my if I can put it to you
A	well I will yeah yeah but that's not why I'm going to see the doctor the doctor I'm going to see the doctor about my skin
B	yeah
A	cos I wanna see if if this have you seen noticed this thing on my the side of my face?
B	yeah I think it's er I don't think it's erm I I I've looked a lot at malignant tumours on the on the er er web or net web or net?
A	I'm I'm both no no
B	right
A	the net is a general
B	then I look at a lot on the net about skin cancers because I am particularly vulnerable to them
A	are you?
B	one I'm fair skinned two I've been working with chemicals and er erm er er light erm ultraviolet radiation I've been under
A	oh
B	so I have to be very careful about my skin
A	mm
B	cos er I I can you know you get skin cancer
A	mm
B	from my job and erm what you have on your visage is not in my humble opinion well it's just not a a a er it's not a a a a a bin er what do they call what's the opposite of benign?
A	malignant
B	I don't think it's malignant skin cancer I think it probably is a skin cancer but I don't think it is erm
A	malignant
B	malignant I think it's er and there's a vast array of stuff you get them with flaps growing on your skin and stuff like this and
A	and no I've had I've had this develop in the last week I'm
B	but that's called an erection
A	no
B	oh sorry no right my god are you kidding me? what the fuck is that?

A	yeah
B	oh shit come over here

A	scabies
B	I had well I had scabies a couple of years ago and I literally washed every fucking thing and I ended up stripped off my
A	I think it's a heat rash
B	are you hot?
A	not now but I was when it developed and I think it just spread
B	I'd get that looked at immediately I've never seen anything
A	well
B	fuck me man
A	oh well I'm going to see the doctor on Thursday
B	good god
A	no no
B	gee whiz

B	I would get her get her opinion I mean
A	well I will on
B	god
A	as I say it's getting better so it's not as itchy as some itchy as

B	yes
A	that's what Nixon had wasn't it?
B	president Nixon?
A	yeah
B	oh was it?
A	I think so that's er that just springs to my mind well and you said it's er a vein thing? it's erm it's it's was that it?
B	well it is a possible phlebitis I mean I don't know he had a a phlebitis that I sort of looked at on the on the web was er on the net was erm I think it was caused by erm by infection I think so erm but

B	today's English
A	by by British
B	by yesterday's speaking
A	yesterday's speaking and yes today's English but yesterday's speaking there you go and somebody is gonna be listening to us in the future and using it for their dissertation

B	right well then that's a very grave responsibility that I've got here in my
A	not at all
B	throat
A	not at all ah so do you wanna stop and watch the TV?

B	oh I don't know I think it's because
A	but that's called that's called a slide trombone isn't it?

A	I suppose reality is
B	but but that's the that's for me that's just for me it's not er I'm not basing that on anyone else that you know I try not to anybody else I try you know I am pretty vindictive if someone hurts me I weigh it up and I think well yeah I'll either do something immediately or I'll wait for them to do it to themselves or I'll wait and then do it to them so I'm just like anyone else I think just more honest
A	well you are many things

A	but like anybody else you are not
B	well that's yeah
A	you're a you're a one off
B	well er exactly like everybody else

A	yeah yeah and that er they but they thought it was such a
B	jesus christ
A	that that was yeah I know so he had no idea er about the the quality of the music but he realised and was told of its potential and he said well yeah go ahead and they said well what do you need? and then Mike Oldfield wrote down a whole long list of all these different instruments that he needed including the glockenspiel and all the rest of it
B	oh yes
A	and he played every instrument on the album himself
B	does he?
