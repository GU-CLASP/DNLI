A	erm
B	can you go from one different one to the other?
A	I still don't know how but I think you can
B	mm
C	no
A	erm with a lot of very difficult programming
B	but how do people?
A	and he's in multiplayer I think
B	how do people know about him?
A	erm cos he made loads of videos on Youtube
B	okay
A	and also he plays in multiplayer
B	do you play in multiplayer?
D	no
A	I play in single player creative mode actually I play single player survival mode
C	so he has to feed himself
B	he has to feed himself?
C	yeah
B	okay
C	and he's life
A	you have to like you yeah life and hunger I have a life bar and hunger bar and an experience point bar
B	mm
A	erm multiplayer you play with like loads of other people
B	mm
A	which seems very difficult
B	but what do you do with them?
A	erm
B	you just hang out with them?
A	erm you can hang out with them you can battle them
B	okay
A	and
C	but never battle Stampy
C	cos he made a creeper when he was
B	he was what?
C	somebody
A	no that's notch
C	notch accidentally made a creeper when he was trying to make a pig
A	wait is that mine?
B	he yeah he accidentally made a creeper?
A	notch who is an who is the who made Minecraft
B	it's all a complete foreign language to me
A	accidentally
B	made a creeper
A	made a creeper which is a big exploding thing erm instead of trying instead of making a pig
B	ah well is it similar? the buttons that you need
A	er no
B	well how did he accidentally do that?
A	no idea
B	do you think it was accidentally on purpose?
C	no
A	er no it said it in my book
B	oh well I don't see how you can
A	must well most people must have really complicated programming
B	hm?
A	I guess he just like erm was I guess it's just like erm things that
B	was everybody cross that he?
A	erm
B	destroyed something?
A	he didn't destroy anything
B	oh I thought you said he blew something up
A	no that was a Creeper
C	no you kill Creepers like in Minecraft
B	you can kill Creepers in Minecraft?
A	yeah and they blow stuff up
B	what is a Creeper?
A	erm a
B	it sounds like a tree is it a tree?
C	no
A	er no that's a that's another Creeper
B	oh
A	oh I'll spawn one for you in Minecraft next time I'm playing it
B	but what does it look like?
A	it's I'll show you you'll see when I spawn it
B	well is it an animal? or a?
C	it's a like it's this kind of made up thing
B	fine okay hard to describe
A	yeah too hard
C	yeah
C	it looks a bit like
B	oh okay
A	it doesn't look like cube
C	yeah the head and the legs
B	yeah but darling all the things in Minecraft are cube-shaped aren't they?
A	yeah well pixel is a common term
B	so can you have any more people in your world?
A	erm
C	no
A	if I click on Minecraft realms it does cost money but if I like wanted to buy a Minecraft realm with my friends then they could go on with me
B	well Minecraft costs money
A	yeah Minecraft realms costs even more money
B	mm not too much money though
A	no
A	so maybe if
B	mm hm
B	mm
A	although it that's another good reason cos if
B	mm
A	he would never be able to
B	right
A	and because I when I started off at my spawn point
B	mm
A	it was an island then I found out how to fly but I didn't know how to get down yet
B	mm
A	so I just flew across and landed on another island
B	okay
A	after I finally got down although that and although loads of monsters spawned there and I didn't know monsters could harm you then and knowing monsters could be harmless
B	mm
A	so I was like leck them let them stay there until
B	mm hm
A	when it burned
B	yeah
B	right
A	and then finally once I
B	good wow
A	he would never be able to find it cos it's unlimited there's an unlimited world
C	we listened to his music and on the radio he
B	I told you that he died but I was just wondering cos you said your teacher was talking about him which teacher?
C	yeah missus
B	missus
C	yeah
B	is she sad that he's dead?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	very
A	I don't really want any more scrambled eggs you can have them
B	really?
A	I want you to have them
B	okay
A	because then cos
B	I'm very surprised
A	cos you made them I want you to have even more
B	would you like some strawberries and ice cream?
A	erm I already had some strawberries today so I think I'll just keep it the crackers
B	crackers and butter?
A	crackers margarine and cheese
C	I think I might
B	again?
A	yeah they're lovely
B	okay
A	they are
A	I'm a boy of simple pleasures
B	you are a boy of simple pleasures
A	I could lick if I didn't if I didn't need all those other things to keep me going
B	yes
A	like alive I could live on these
A	that's how nice they are I would eventually get sick of them but
B	I think you probably would yes
A	yeah I would go oh I don't like these anymore here's some toast mm can I have some more crackers now?
A	three years later I'm sick of them here's some toast yum can I have some more crackers now?
B	can you design any room in Minecraft?
A	erm
B	could you have a giant marshmallow room?
A	erm you can't get marshmallow blocks but you can get white blocks
B	mm
C	and snow
A	and yeah you can get snow never quartz which is white
B	mm hm
A	or
B	that's all the cheese by the way
A	erm never quartz wool
B	never quartz?
A	nether quartz it's nether quartz block which is just which is basically just a white block it looks a little and then you can get a block of iron which is a little shiny
B	mm hm
A	can I please have a knife?
B	mm hm and what is the thing that you keep going on about both of you? this type of stone precious thing
D	diamond
B	no
A	obsidian?
B	obsidian that's it
A	oh yeah it's really hard to get destroyed
A	yeah it and if you and it's used for the portal to the nether
B	what's the nether?
A	the nether is a rather hellish place I don't really want to talk
B	okay
B	cos I got lost there for about a week I couldn't find my portal
B	mm
A	and annoyingly on PC there is there's not a limited amount of nether so I could have so I could have gone on and on and on
C	yeah
B	or some ketchup instead?
B	cos you've only eaten like one and a half slices with all the bits taken off it
B	you can have a cheese only pizza
A	oh mum?
B	a pizza bianca isn't it
A	yeah but mum
B	mm mm
B	mm hm

B	are you preparing? are you planning for your birthday party? is that why you're telling me?
A	yeah
B	yeah you know when your birthday is don't you?
A	yeah but it wouldn't take a lot of planning
B	like what? nine months of planning of of a movie and a pizza night?
A	well not pizza night there's a menu
B	we're going to be there's going to be a menu?
A	yep
B	is there now?
A	we have our tip we have tip top chef
C	me
A	no your
B	aw do you remember? it's a sous chef isn't it if you're an assistant chef?
A	no she's a cheflet cos she's too small to be a sous chef
B	cheflet
B	that's a good name would you like to be my little cheflet
C	I'm the top cheflet
B	you're the
C	top cheflet
B	the top cheflet

C	can I have some ice cream mum?
A	erm well we're going to
B	when you've eaten your pizza yes
A	we're going to be cooking them
B	mm
A	and that means that basically they're make their own pizza I might sneak a I might sneak a stirred fried menu not stir fried a dead basically a dead sprout mushed up into
A	and then
B	will you invite
A	erm that's a good question I'm not I haven't decided yet I think there is a really big chance I will
A	I'm not engaged I'm not engaged I'm not in love
A	yeah she's nice
B	she's well she's basically like
A	mum?
B	mm
A	can you cut the cheese up a little more cos it's not that thin it's a little thick
B	not really cos they're tiny pieces my love but I'll try
A	yeah but they are quite thick
B	mm but they are quite difficult to cut up
A	true
B	so in my lesson today to the adults that I teach we were looking at similes and metaphors have you guys done those at school yet?
C	yeah
A	I don't even know
C	but I've forgotten
B	well I think you probably haven't
A	yeah similes and metaphors
B	well
A	they sound familiar though
B	a good way of remembering what a simile is is that it sounds similar to something else
C	similar
B	so her eyes were like diamonds that's a simile
C	oh I've done that before
B	yeah?
C	oh yeah
B	but a metaphor is her eyes were diamonds that's the difference not a lot of difference really
C	her eyes are diamonds
B	but obviously they're not really diamonds are they? it's just a way an expression to for us to realise how beautiful her eyes were
C	yeah
A	when you do like cos if her eyes really were diamonds then she'd be rich
B	hang on but that's what I was just saying it's not an actual factual representation is it?
A	no
B	it's a nice description
A	mum can we watch some scream street?
B	well possibly but you saw two
B	yesterday are you not going to eat the rest of that pizza?
A	yeah but we started seeing but we started seeing it
B	I can't believe how much fuss you made about it
C	sorry
