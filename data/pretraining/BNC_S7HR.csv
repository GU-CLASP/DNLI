A	here we are hello
B	hello sorry I'm just gonna send this text so you're wasting your time
A	oh well that's alright
A	I think
B	erm
A	erm yeah so while you're doing that I'm going to have a little look at BBC football
B	okay
A	it's the weather
B	you go no no I really am rather homesick
B	it's not nothing to do with the weather but this is
B	finally got seasonal affective disorder in February at the end of February
A	yeah that's not bad though I wonder if the snow makes your SAD happen a bit sort of later in the season?
A	you going to tell me a story?
B	yeah me and
A	oh
B	a couple of weeks ago and on his way home he got hit by a car and has broken his leg
A	oh shit
B	and he can't get out of bed for a month
A	oh my god
B	and I feel really responsible if I'd
B	said nicer things he'd have got a better report he wouldn't have been forced to go discussion club he wouldn't have broken his leg
A	that's funny
A	jeepers that's nuts so in that chain of events you had a role to play there
B	I know I feel really really responsible I need to email
A	no
B	him this weekend and be like
A	sorry
B	sorry
A	no but don't though because
B	no I know I'm only kidding like I know it's not my fault
A	I know
B	mm hm sorry sorry sorry sorry
A	as he just thought right I'm not having this I'm not handling it any more
B	I know
A	I'm being pulled to do nothing I want to just lay here for a whole and then low and behold he's created that reality for himself
B	uhu
A	that's nuts
B	the the worst part of this is if the if a student misses more than a few classes because they're ill
A	yeah
B	they have to have lessons
A	three isn't it?
B	I can't remember
A	yeah and you have to do extra private lessons
B	yeah but I've got to go to his house cos he can't get out of bed
A	ah shit
B	so I've got to go to this
A	where is he? is he far?
B	I don't know
A	surely you can refuse?
B	well I don't want to
A	yeah
B	he'll survive without me
A	I'm sure he will
B	and you know like
A	cheers
B	he is one of the weakest kids in that whole level
A	yeah
B	so
A	why is that?
B	he's really lazy
A	oh well
B	and he's not very bright
A	I think the kids who aren't very bright you know if you can got the opportunity for some one to one time that might potentially inspire them or where they could grow and develop from that opportunity then great but if he's really lazy then
B	mm hm
A	you're not huh
B	yeah we're doing this lesson once on different types of intelligence
A	mm hm
B	and he was like out of these ones I think
B	oh god
A	isn't this just excellent coffee by the way?
B	I've not tried it yet but it looks
A	you should have sat here so you can watch your man making it he just looks like he loves his job
B	mm hm
A	born to do this job
B	yeah there's a guy in Krakow as well who
A	mm yeah
B	and whenever erm he's not there
A	where's that?
B	on the square
A	oh I think you told me about that before
B	and I'm sad for you I'm sad because we couldn't sit and talk but obviously I understand and
A	I really thought she'd say phew I didn't wanna go either
A	she might be jumping for joy
B	where?
A	I know
B	nice
A	we've twenty centimetres worth of banana
B	no I don't know what that means
A	I'm going to google that
B	sure
A	mm
B	to something but I don't know what the word is
A	yes never your infinitive split
B	hm
A	hm
B	so
A	so there we are
B	that was my story anyway about my boy with broken leg
B	for which I'm entirely responsible for
A	not at all
B	I could have pushed him under that car myself
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I really
A	mm
B	I really do and
A	mm
B	and I think it's well
A	mm
B	I suppose
A	yeah it's my perspective on that is that
B	yeah
A	part of their sort of higher and greater development
B	mm hm
A	that is obviously serving them at this moment
B	I know
A	hm
B	I just want them to
A	mm hm
B	because they're graded on
A	yeah
B	and if they don't have these social skills because they're too shy then they won't get the marks
A	they won't do it
B	and one of these boys he's trying to get into this International Baccalaureate class
A	oh yeah cool
B	he's in
A	yeah
B	he did FCE last year and got an A I think
A	wow
B	and he's in CAE and he's fifteen so that's super high
A	yeah so
B	and no CPE for schools so the higher you get the harder it is
A	so
B	yeah
A	that's difficult
B	he's mature and he's very good at English like his words that he uses are really good and he's really considered and everything is perfect and there's no mistakes but it's forcing him to have an opinion
A	mm hm
B	and even forcing him to having a conversation like oh you finished early just chat to your partner
A	yeah
A	mm
B	well
A	yeah
B	just issue cue cards
A	a pebble or something and say right you know every time you hold this pebble in your left hand you take on a different persona
B	mm hm
A	and you then have the persona of somebody who does know how to have a conversation so just a little something you can keep in his pocket and slip into his hand
B	yeah
A	when he needs to you know sort of switch and access so it's a bit like that oh I don't know what to say and well but if you did know what to say what would it be?
B	what would it be?
A	so when you put the pebble in your hand you become a person who would know what to say
B	mm hm mm hm
A	just might be a little psychological trick that you can play with if he can be somebody else for long enough to
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	brilliant
B	because I was like
B	and some of them I was like no not enough no not enough no say it again say it again it's not good enough
A	good for you
B	and they were like oh
A	oh
B	you know and like giving me like evils I was like no not having it
A	good for you
B	why?
B	it was this boy there were only seven of them there were four people missing there was
B	no
A	no
B	he's a teenager
A	oh
B	he was sat next to
A	a cattle prod up the rear?
B	well he needed a bit of an attitude transplant
A	oh okay
B	because
A	yeah
B	er and then there was another girl who was like dead sassy I was like woah woah woah love you'll get nowhere with that attitude
A	oh was she sat next to her brother who was the muscle man with tattoos?
B	no no they weren't there they weren't there
A	oh okay
B	I really hoped they were cos
A	I know
B	and the
A	she kept flashing her cleavage at me it's like just don't do that
B	yeah
A	I mean this is in October as well November or some cold month yeah
B	yeah
A	put them away love
B	asked them
A	they're going to be having babies together
A	yes
B	so I was really looking forward to going in and like
A	yeah
B	having a bit of a go
A	yeah I really liked I really like him actually
B	but they weren't there
A	cos he always had really cool hair he's obviously a lot older than everybody else in the class got some interesting tattoos
B	yeah really sad he wasn't there
A	he's into cars you know he's you could get you can find things that he was interested in
B	uhu uhu
A	like tattoos and cars to talk to him about mechanics and things like that so you know he was up for that but with her she just sort of wanted to sit and pout and put her cleavage on show which I just didn't really get
B	mm hm
A	is she quite short?
B	yeah
A	yeah I think I remember her
B	she needed a bit of a
A	yeah
B	rolling them into next week in a minute
B	but I really enjoyed and there was one girl who
B	I was like don't have to look so worried
A	she probably looked like that emoticon from Scream
B	is it that bad?
A	nobody's going to die it's okay
B	really no need to look so worried
B	ah
B	no it won't do them any harm it's character building
B	erm
B	oh dear
A	yeah she can catch up with
B	yeah I know I know
A	mm
B	she'll make herself worse
A	yep
B	poor thing
A	oh nice poncho
B	I know she looks
A	yeah
B	no which
A	I do like a poncho if ever I live in South America it'll be so I can wear a poncho every day
A	huh?
B	is that the only reason?
A	well no I'm sure it's a wonderful country with
B	huge expansive rich culture to explore
A	nice
B	which is like the music place of Cuba
B	mm hm
A	yeah so I could learn Spanish there and then maybe end up in Spain rather than Portugal at the end of the year
B	mm hm
A	er just looks really cool
B	mm hm
A	it's gonna feel pretty powerful because of the energy they're putting into it
B	mm hm for all the people
A	yeah
B	good for you motivation station
A	yeah
B	yay
A	for a little bit longer
B	right okay
A	so
B	mm
A	it will it is it's good
B	yeah
A	doo doo
B	I just need to sort of just chill out a little bit
A	when's
B	tomorrow lunch time
A	cool so you've got another night
B	mm
A	good for you
B	mm
A	have you got sun on your balcony at this time?
B	only in the mornings
A	mm
B	until about two
A	is it in the kitchen yet?
B	no
B	no
A	mm German shepherd
B	mm they're cute
A	I don't know why people need to hold their dog so close to the lead that's probably the
B	mm hm
A	mm I really do feel for dogs here it's such a different culture erm one of my neighbours has got a new puppy and I only know that cos it's outside yipping its heart out obviously missing its mother and missing contact with its siblings
B	oh
A	erm and they just leave it there and they're outside in the snow they're outside in the wind they're outside in the rain and a lot of them have kennels and shelters but I'd have called the RSPCA by now I called the USPCA on one of my neighbours when I lived in
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm but that job that job that dog used to live out in the garden and didn't have much by way of shelter now
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and the conditions were squalid and disgusting and it was often chained up and not having an opportunity to even run around the garden where as here at least the dogs that are outdoors in minus temperatures at least they get to run around a bit so I suppose that's something in a way but even so
B	mm hm
A	well let it in your bed then
B	I said well yeah let it in your house hang out with it more
A	yeah
B	and she was like I was like well what do you use it for? and she was like oh well to guard the property and I was like
A	you live in
B	like no
A	yeah
B	and two like
A	that's nickable
B	that's nickable? apart from like TVs and laptops
A	and why this fear of crime?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so crime isn't a problem it's the fear of crime I wonder if that's why all my neighbours have dogs that live outside?
B	yeah but I
A	yeah yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	mm hm mm I suppose it wakes you up and you
A	well
B	then you look out of the window
A	yeah
B	yeah just play together
A	so they can play together and they do
B	ah
A	ah I know it's little doggy no mates but has got chicken friends
B	nice
A	so all my neighbours have chickens and ducks as well
B	nice
A	so
B	oh I really miss dogs
A	and there's another place I think that was in Austria too
B	oh I wanna work there
A	so a big part of your job is clearing up shit from animals which I'm quite up for erm and the reviews are hilarious because the reviews range from oh it's brilliant there's one cat that comes and sits on your shoulder and you work away with it like it's a parrot and you stay there all day erm through to other reviews that have said oh there are cats everywhere it was disgusting they were even on the kitchen table and blah blah blah so it's like
B	uhu
A	people's reactions to this situation are really quite different so I thought I might like to go there was well
B	sounds fun
A	yeah
B	the world's your oyster
A	and I wanna learn to ride a horse
B	by this time next year I want to be able to speak fluent Spanish
A	cool
B	cool dude
A	and be living and working
B	yeah in Andalusia
A	cool
B	yeah
A	see the mountains
B	I really want to go to South America but
A	oh that's just fear it's bollocks
B	there's loads of kids being born with small heads
A	no it's not real
B	what you mean it's not real?
A	it's a it's a media fabrication
B	in what way?
A	so symptoms exist and things are happening and people are happening and shit and stuff but it's like it's just like bovine thingy BSE and swine flu and bird flu and that AK47
B	mm hm
A	what are one thing whatever that virus was they bring it out every couple of years it's just to keep humanity in its place and spread fear it's not real
B	oh I can't remember
A	and some American person died or nearly died
B	can't remember
A	oh can't remember
A	yeah but no there's something every year it's all bollocks so no don't let fear rule your life
B	yeah
A	in fact yeah going back to what you were saying earlier
B	about what?
B	that's true
A	see joy or fear
B	yes
A	yeah
B	Spain first though get my Spanish get well learn to speak Spanish
A	cool
B	and one of the Chinese teacher at school wants English lessons
A	right
B	so with me I think er and I want Spanish lessons from the Spanish teacher
A	so does the Spanish teacher want to learn Chinese? that can work out really well
B	I know it would really work no one pays anything
A	yeah there's a let scheme in Cambridge
B	mm hm
A	for someone and they give you a credit and then you spend your credit with someone else so there's no money
B	it's a good idea
A	it's just like a skills exchange this is the future
B	yeah
A	I look forward to a moneyless economy
B	yeah
A	in fact yeah I suppose that's the collapse of a global economy really
B	yeah I know I know
A	it's all sort of
A	so he was actually wanting a hotel
B	that's hilarious
A	yeah so I think some things can be lost in translation between Spain and South America
B	hm
A	mm
B	which is fine if
A	mm
B	I'm hoping that it will do in the next forty percent of the book and then I'll feel inclined to finish it
B	at the moment I'm just like where is this book going?
A	mm
B	so I'm sticking to my resolutions which is Woman's Hour every day
A	cool
B	Spanish
A	good for you
B	I've abandoned doing the Guardian crossword everyday
B	so that resolution failed but
A	oh well
A	well rather than that resolution having failed maybe that resolution just wasn't necessarily appropriate for this stage and point in your life
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm hm
A	mm hm
B	yeah
A	gorgeous aren't they? technically that's a rock dove cos it's got two black stripes
B	oh
A	but well they're all much of a muchness really aren't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	nasty vermin like creatures
B	mm hm
A	and I never really appreciated them and now I've kind of done away with that out of date belief system I can really enjoy them starlings in particular are beautiful I remember at being in a hostel in New Zealand and the woman who was running the hostel being delighted almost showing off telling me we get starlings here wow
B	mm
A	ah
B	oh well
A	have you got a brolly?
B	yeah but it's fallen to bits
A	mm
B	you know these erm
B	it was like a really cheap one and all of the prongs spokes
A	oh
B	you know like in a circle sort of where there joint is
A	yeah
B	and I'm really sort of anticipating that one day that it's gonna slowly slowly collapse and close in on my head
B	you know like one of those like I don't know what they're called Venus flytrap
A	yeah
B	so it's just like the saddest umbrella of all time
A	so a decent brolly is next on the
B	but then again I don't want to fucking have to buy an umbrella
A	yeah that's true
B	cos then it's inviting rain
A	cos if you're only here till June and you're gonna have to either leave it behind or take it with you
B	yeah
A	then yeah
B	mm
A	but then is there space in your life in Spain for an umbrella that sparks joy?
B	it doesn't rain in Spain
A	mainly on the plane
B	family in Andalusia
A	oh dear
B	yeah
A	no I'm alright on the beverage front it's three thirty-eight so
B	got half an hour
A	yeah half and hour
B	yeah where to?
A	I don't know just a general sunny amble
B	walk down is that market still on
A	no

B	so I just don't have time
A	no
B	good for you and it has really nice dates
A	and it has lovely moist dates yeah that's very true
B	mm hm
A	just a bit too blended
B	yeah
A	I like the look of the little pesto blob on the top though that really sparked me with ooh
B	yeah it was okay
A	but a bit too
B	but it wasn't the
A	the
B	that was all hummus
A	that was all chunky
B	it was like actual

B	yeah blended into non-existent
A	gonna have to make some it's the only way
B	yes please
A	it's got booze in is that alright for non-drinking February? theoretically speaking the alcohol will have burned off in all that heat
B	mm hm
A	no definitely not definitely not but it did cross my mind what do I do with the other half of bottle that's not in the lentil pie?
B	oh right
A	ha ha ha ha ha ha
B	I think I just I just feel fine like I don't feel inclined and there's been loads of opportunities you know like on Tuesday night and last night when I was with
A	yeah
B	in normal world
A	I know
B	I would just had a pint
A	crossed the square and gone down for a drink yeah
