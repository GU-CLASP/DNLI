A	yeah yeah just saying how lovely they all were obviously and I was saying
B	yeah
A	how it's still lovely to buy all the girls' clothes
B	yes
A	I said but you just find yourself looking at all the lovely girls' clothes and then she was talking about the new Primark in erm
B	oh yeah yeah
A	okay erm
A	yes and how it was all I dunno three-quarters of the clothes were
B	was that what
A	girls'
B	with
A	yes
B	yeah I know it is
A	and and er and then one of the lads pointed out well that's just generally how
B	that's just how it is in life
A	so they they may as well get
A	used to it while they're little I said
B	yeah
A	well that's true actually yes
B	mm
A	girls have far more variety of clothes
B	yeah they do
A	oh my dress was tight though I've gotta lose some weight
B	was it?
A	I had to come home and put my dressing gown on
A	oh did it look really tight? did it look bad?
B	no no it was
A	are you sure?
B	yeah no
A	cos I was just very you looked lovely
B	oh no I looked
A	you did no you looked really nice
B	looked the the size of a whale
A	I was just pleased that my short er skirt wasn't quite as short as yours and
B	oh yeah
A	because I've got that much fatter the dress was riding up and I thought oh
B	well that's happened to me so cos it was I thought it was quite respectable and and long
A	yours was lovely you looked really nice and
B	mm yeah
A	yeah and he got back
A	had you pulled up at about the same time or had you been hanging around outside?
B	no we'd been hanging cos to coincide with his nap
A	oh I see yeah because erm
B	oh really?
A	and he'd been cycling and he had to get changed
B	oh wow
A	I said we need to get going cos of the traffic and then
B	yeah
A	he started feeling sick so we had to pull in at Tesco Express to get chewing gum so we didn't
B	oh really? oh crikey
B	yeah
B	oh yes cos
A	I said we've got to get
B	and it really make sense
A	oh
B	yes it was like oh I can't wait to be part of your growing up or
A	yeah
B	broken
B	well that's why
A	and erm
B	yeah they bought one
A	yes yes they did well
B	oh yeah
A	we got back and so we didn't stop oh we
B	yeah
A	and
B	late and
A	and then on the way I said well do you want to go to the Co-op? and we didn't really have time
B	yeah
A	and she said oh I'm gonna get one later I I will do it but it'll just be a bit late I said well okay then and then when he had to pull over anyway I says well you may as well look while you're in there
A	erm and they found one so
B	ah
A	and all the babies were cute lying on the little thing yesterday it's funny how the two of them love being on their front isn't it?
B	oh yeah no they won't go on their back
A	yeah and
B	it's so funny cos
B	that way
A	back to where they want to be
B	and
A	she's tiny she's she's got the right name I meant to say that to her
B	yeah
A	like a flower
B	yeah she's bulked out
A	very delicate little thing
B	she's bulked a lot
A	but she looks very delicate
B	yeah she does and
A	to the others
B	when she sits it's like this and she's very you put her up on her feet and she's very like this
B	and the others are just like
A	solid yes
B	yeah
A	standing yeah yeah
B	that's what the extra three pound at birth
A	well that's right
B	mm
A	good a good healthy baby boy and he's been really good since then
B	yes
A	so what did you yeah so you bought your baby weaning book what were you gonna look at?
B	oh I was going to plan when I was going to make more
A	food?
B	yes
A	you should
B	yeah
A	or your your apple and your pear
B	make a little bit more mm
A	can you just or can you just mash it down? you know when you just when you just
B	yes
A	when you just cook it in the pan
B	mm
A	and not puree it then?
B	yeah
A	so
B	I need to do apple and pear
A	if you can I would
A	say do that cos I thought even if you come out to Bulgaria we could do things like that
B	mm yeah
A	and they'd be quite easy to make and if he cos we wouldn't have a blender out there but you could do that
B	yeah
A	and we could do erm pasta
B	yeah I've got some good recipes for for pasta sauces and things
A	oh have you?
B	mm
A	oh that's good
B	so er
B	it's just a case of
A	just tomaoey based ones or cheese based ones
B	no no it's cheese and chickens and all sorts yeah
A	cos he can have erm the cheese and presumably the little
B	mm
A	cos we can buy yogurts out there as well
B	yeah yogurts he'll start those
A	cos he'll be seven months if you come out to Bulgaria
B	yeah
A	so he'll be onto things like that and just bread
B	mm hm
A	yeah
B	just so he settles down on
A	mm hm
B	and then I introduce stuff like that then
A	er yeah I mean he's over five months now so like you say
B	mm
A	some babies at six months are much smaller and
B	yeah yeah
A	so at
B	oh yeah definitely
A	or
B	he had erm
A	what's he had?
B	this morning when he woke up
B	he had some milk
A	yeah
B	then he
A	yeah
B	I'd get him up
A	yeah
B	he could have his milk have his breakfast properly
A	mm hm
B	and then
A	yeah
B	again if he could just hang on
A	yeah
B	but I'm just gonna give him another few days till his teeth have settled down as well
A	yeah
B	erm
A	then there'll be no
B	yes
A	more feeds in the night
B	no just
A	you've been warned
B	difficult with
A	yes
B	so there's no
A	no best to give to him in the night yeah
B	oh definitely yeah
A	but you won't have to worry about
B	health visitors no no
A	no he's gonna be fine I said it was just gonna be a phase
B	yeah
A	he
B	mm hm
A	he's an absolute credit to you
B	that was a
A	like I say he hadn't gone off it it wasn't the case he didn't like it
B	no it wasn't no
A	I think it was his teeth and I just think
B	yeah
A	he didn't want the teat in his mouth and it was hurting him and he obviously still needs it cos the minute you want it he needed it he just drank a whole bottle down so
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't think he's gonna he's not he's not gonna go off food he's been good since the day he was born with taking his milk
B	yeah
A	and his food
B	uhu
A	you were fairly fussy as I remember
B	yeah
B	well this is yeah the why I do wanna get him started on lots of different things but
A	fish fingers were good as well
B	yeah
A	and when he's you know little if you wanted to just do the fish fingers take the skin off
B	mm
A	you could
B	yeah
A	and just
B	mm
A	and that's nice and again a lot of your sauces that you've got the recipes for you can probably put on erm
B	oh there's fish yeah fish and pasta
A	mm
B	for pasta which would be er which I'll do
A	yeah cos all those are nice soft foods that erm
B	mm
A	you shouldn't have any problem with
B	yeah
A	ideal
B	so that's yeah that's really from about six six to nine months he needs to be on those sort of things
A	uhu
B	I just
A	has she started yet?
B	yeah yeah she's doing a one a day of like
A	is she eating it?
B	erm not a lot a spoon two
A	she was never keen on her milk though was she? she's not been a big
B	er well
A	or does
B	not out of the bottle
A	yes she's still breastfeeding him isn't she?
B	mm yeah she doesn't take anything that's not off
A	right
A	uhu
B	I think it's probably just getting her at the right time though actually there's more
B	just get her at the right
A	yeah
B	time and she'll probably have it all
A	yeah
B	next night oh she fed at eleven one three five
B	oh we just literally that's what she text it was eleven one three five four times in the night
B	there's just no routine with her whatsoever
A	that's crazy at
B	do whatever she wants but there's no I mean
A	which some of them some people do it and they get on with it but I couldn't be like that
B	but
A	I need
B	it was like when we
A	to establish your life
B	when we were saying yesterday we were talking together and I kind of went erm they yeah the we were discussing like
A	who was this?
B	this is
A	oh
B	this is
A	yeah he's a tall chap isn't he?
B	better get back yeah
A	mm
B	really tall
A	mm
B	very tall I mean she's not short either
A	no no
B	erm yeah they had to look into special not a special pram but they had to consider the height of them with the pushchair
A	oh right just so tall
B	yes but erm she was like oh we've got to get you know we'll have to make a move in a minute obviously I said yeah yeah of course you know bath

A	I I like her
B	when you said my friend
A	well I see her a lot yes
B	well yes she's got I think she's kind of grounded herself a lot more than she used to be she used to be very loud and
A	ah well she's no she's just grown up then you know
B	yeah
A	oh what's what's that one? salmon with carrots and tomato oh
B	yeah lovely freeze it
B	so erm
A	and have they got ages when they say or can he have all of this really? if he's not really
B	well this is kind of your second stage weaning so this I think this is gonna be once between seven and nine months
A	oh I see okay yeah yeah
B	oh seven-month-old baby still needs to be supported whilst you are feeding him and more often than not still has no teeth
A	yeah
A	was
B	yeah yeah
B	no no one else has got teeth
A	well done
A	well done
A	yeah
B	he's got two now have you seen his other one?
A	yes yeah
B	it's here
A	yeah
B	both come through now
A	yeah saw him yesterday
B	mm
A	well done hopefully he'll have a bit of a bit of
B	break
A	respite now
B	couple of weeks yeah
A	yeah
A	yes cos I can't remember
B	start his new foods
A	so things like eggs cheese dairy can they can have them to six months can't they?
B	let's have a look it's tells you all in here
A	I just remember with us it was nuts obviously they said don't give them nuts
B	yes
A	for twelve months
B	uhu
A	but I don't think it er and eggs cooked
B	oh okay
A	or was it or
B	yes
A	no no they could have eggs
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'm
B	but you have to cook them really well
A	erm oh I'm just trying to think
B	I think it's in the front of here
A	I'm just trying to think could could he have soft boiled eggs? cos you used to have egg and soldiers do you remember? used to dip your
B	yes uhu
A	your soldiers and that that's not cooked that's only semi-boiled cos the yoke's runny
B	yeah it's all er it was all in the front of here
A	but I can't remember so I'm just wondering if there's anything that they say to avoid
B	erm definitely was in here
A	cos it said you can start with cow's milk in cooking didn't it from six months
B	yes
A	right
B	six to nine months soft eggs EG
A	oh I see
B	well-cooked scrambled eggs
A	oh
B	or one year added salt
A	oh okay
B	sugar limited amount from twelve months whole cow's milk as a main drink
A	as a main drink
B	honey pate soft cheese
A	all the stuff that you avoid when you're pregnant and chopped nuts
B	and chopped nuts when they're five
A	so really the things you avoid well you you wouldn't give a baby pate or soft cheeses particularly would you?
B	god no crikey
A	but why this honey at twelve
B	oh yeah no it wouldn't surprise me yeah
A	they say about honey but erm I had honey on pancakes on holiday it was lovely
B	yeah
A	I was looking for the maple syrup but it's either honey or chocolate sauce
A	well I had some of that as well to be honest when I I had two bottles of it cos I was trying all the bottles that but they were all the same they were all chocolate sauce
B	yes
A	that was
B	that's when
A	to be avoided with your banana
B	yeah this is
A	they're you
B	yeah
A	on the on the screenshot you sent me of him having a banana allergy
B	when you've got your like pudding as well
A	uhu
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	with the salmon that would be erm
B	yes
A	if you and
B	oh yeah yeah
A	cook a piece in the micro oven just rather than
B	yeah
A	cook it all and freeze it
B	he's not a big fan so I'll have some and then yeah
A	well I like it as well
B	yeah
A	erm just do just just steam it in the microwave
B	yeah
A	and get flake him a little bit off
B	yeah
A	and then you can erm
B	I mean even if I make some portions then I freeze it then it's like well erm
A	what cake is that you're eating? coffee?
B	yeah
A	since when do you like coffee cake?
B	I've always liked coffee cake
A	mm is it
B	I just don't like coffee
A	no
A	it says here in this erm
B	mm
A	that from six months
B	yeah
A	erm that you can use normal erm cereals
B	yes like Weetabix and things
A	Weetabix and
B	yeah
A	Ready Brek and it says that erm don't be fooled by the long list of vitamins and minerals cos they're getting that from a balanced diet
B	yeah
A	somebody's waking up down there
B	mm
A	and then it says erm
B	he can hear the talk of food
A	and it says that in a rusk contains erm some contain more sugar than a donut
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	which is
A	and it also says if babies are drinking less
B	uhu
A	than the twenty-one fluid ounces which is says they should be having up till they're twelve months old
B	twenty-one?
A	well it says eighteen to twenty-one
B	okay
A	in er erm up until his
A	up until he's a year old
B	oh okay alright then
A	but it does say if they're not having that
B	uhu
A	cos they don't want it erm a small children's sized pot of yogurt or a matchbox size piece of cheese is the equivalent to two fluid ounces
B	oh okay
A	so if they're having yogurts
B	mm
A	I think which you always had lots of cos this the only thing that they won't get is is the iron so they're saying put it in cauliflower cheese
B	yeah
A	milk in your recipes you can count all that
B	mm
A	and if you you're using recipes and also the things that like your dairy products
B	yeah
A	all adding towards it so they're getting the right amount so
B	uhu
A	I thought that was erm that was quite good
B	well he's never had below eighteen so
A	no
B	even on his very bad days he was having twenty so
A	if it's a cod grated cheese orange juice and crushed cornflakes oh
B	yes
B	it's on there's a recipe in there mm
A	if your child gets excited at the prospect of fish put it in in a desert
A	yeah and you never got excited about fish I was never any good at that
B	dunno yet
A	how long have you been asleep?
B	about an hour
A	about an hour is that enough for you now
B	uhu so
A	pasta very very good very common
B	yes uhu pasta pasta pasta
A	what's
B	mm
A	another benefit of choosing lumpy food
B	so they talk about
A	do they?
B	does there mm
A	oh right well when you started him eating earlier I'd
B	yeah I suppose
A	bring that forward
B	mm I suppose we didn't think about that bit did we?
A	well no cos they're starting at six aren't they? so you started at four and a half so
B	uhu
A	I'd certainly say by six and a half seven months he can having pasta that was always a favourite so it said it had erm and all these finger foods
B	uhu
A	finger foods by the age of nine months feed yourself
B	yeah I'll leave you to it you can cook yourself as well
A	there was erm
B	yeah?
A	our first bolognaise sauce tomato and basil pasta
B	uhu
