A	my brick?
B	yeah no this isn't a phone this is the er
A	oh it's a
B	the recorder
A	what is it? oh the right
B	this is the phone
A	oh right I thought it was a phone I had a quick look and thought it
B	oh no the phone is back there
A	had a quick look and thought that that was your phone
B	nope a recorder
A	they all look similar nowadays
B	my one's kind of bigger than that
A	oh right
B	it's a touch screen one that mum gave me
A	oh right
B	so you've got my mobile number now
A	yes it's all logged into my little phone I I don't have my own phone that's that's it
B	that's your work phone yeah?
A	that's the work phone yeah
B	yeah when you're not at work it's off
A	exactly yeah
B	yeah I can't believe two years have gone
A	yes
B	that's flown by hasn't it?
A	did I have this when you were?
B	you just got it just before I left
A	yeah
B	I think I went in it once
A	oh right yeah it's it's two years old now
B	yeah still looking pretty new
A	yeah it's not bad
B	really new
A	it needs a clean it's dirty
B	have you seen the school they've built up here?
A	er no but I know they've erm built a lot of stuff since you've gone on the er
B	if you go down up to
A	yeah
B	there up there now
A	I do tend to go up that way a bit
B	yeah
A	but I don't erm take much notice and that if I was plopped further down there at that roundabout and I just was just woke up so that they said where are you know I'd know it now but if someone had said done that to me where I'd just been away when before it was all built and they just put me there I wouldn't know where I was
B	no
A	and I was only a few yards away from a few hundred metres away from where I used to live
B	yeah definitely when I was erm coming back from the airport
A	that's right yeah
B	it's a bit weird
A	it is
B	you go further into
A	no
B	but this was the rich area wasn't it
A	yes yeah
B	it was on the cusp
A	this was
B	yeah
A	so this is what they've done and they're building all over here
B	I mean they're not they're not bad houses
A	oh no they're very nice
B	they're all quite nice yeah
A	yeah they're very nice and they're well thought out and spaced around so
B	so does it kind of up the area a little bit or?
A	erm well it's not downgraded it but
B	no cos I was worried when they were gonna build it was all gonna get more scummy round here or something but
A	well I think we should build some social housing but I don't know well I think they probably have to build some social housing
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	some of that housing is
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they don't they don't look like all erm erm all rabbit hutches or
B	no there's a block there
A	through through the haze of bong smoke or something and they were all all on crack
A	at the time cos back in the sixties
B	yeah
A	you wouldn't get the architecture of the sixties and seventies
B	is terrible isn't it
A	yeah it's awful
B	almost communist or something isn't it
A	the the
B	that grey big it's a monstrous grey building yeah
A	is
B	oh good why is that?
A	the flats have gone in
B	yes
B	not all of them but some of them
A	yeah some of them are gone
B	I did notice that that had changed
A	yeah
B	that was a bit strange
A	they've got
B	oh fair enough
B	yeah
A	just coming up to the average ones here
B	does it mean average speed?
A	yeah so you erm it
B	never heard of that
A	so you clock er down so he'll er er this camera this camera erm coming up on the right
B	yeah
A	will clock our speed going and the one at the end will clock and take an average if we're over thirty odd it will get a speeding ticket
B	oh fair so you get er two
A	yeah so that one there
B	seems a bit slow for this road
A	well it was a forty
B	thirty?
A	it was a forty
B	oh a forty down to a thirty
B	why? doesn't there's no schools here is there
A	er I don't know maybe someone was killed along here
B	right
A	normally there
B	not very residential
A	there's normally a fatality or something
B	mm
A	tends to er change it
B	it's not a money maker then? I take it that if you get a ticket it's got nothing to do with making money it's not a
A	oh no
B	not a monetary fine it would be
A	yeah it's a definite monetary fine it's a system to make money yeah sure
B	at thirty I mean this is ridiculous you
A	yeah
B	you might as well automate this there's no point in driving is there?
A	but it ha
A	they erm
A	they can't really take it down to twenty cos twenty you know and get speed there are twenty
B	you could
A	they've got twenty zones
B	you could cycle at twenty
A	yep there are twenty zones but I don't think they'd ever ticket for going over twenty cos er to be honest you'd be
B	yeah it's difficult to stay at twenty isn't it
A	it would be a bit ridiculous
B	oh
A	so thirty is the is the
B	yeah fair enough
A	now the camera is back there I think
B	so you can speed up a bit
A	so I mean it's never one
B	yeah
A	and the one thing one of the guys um and er as we were driving through as I was driving through
B	yeah
A	school term but I was coming home this way every time and I was thinking Jesus Christ you get so used to the route every day you don't think about it you know where the Gatso camera is
B	yeah
A	well so you didn't take any notice I think additional signing and that but fortunately I never got caught so I'm alright
B	you obviously drive well enough regardless of knowing that the cameras were there
A	well
B	coming through the post
A	I was um I know they've gotta arrive within fourteen days of of it being done
B	so you're alright
A	so every day after that I er was sweated in February
B	oh yeah
A	that year I didn't get one but I sweated
A	yeah fucking hell
B	not a good situation to be in
A	no because you're thinking oh my god
B	you lose your licence you lose your job don't you? I mean what do they do?
A	yes
B	you need to drive for your job
A	I need to drive yeah
B	what would happen in that that situation?
B	no yeah don't tell them
A	no
B	really really stressed
A	yeah just go off and then
B	cos I lost my licence
A	go off
B	you lose your licence for a little while though don't you?
A	yeah
B	a year or?
B	you can't stress er off on stress free?
A	yeah well er
B	oh yeah
A	and that it's gone very er very fast
B	yeah
A	I can't believe it a year has gone
B	how long were you off for?
A	twelve weeks
B	yeah
A	twelve weeks
B	yeah that was when they tried piling you up with much too much work
A	yeah
B	and ridiculously terrible time
A	yeah I mean and redundancy straight redundancy as well so it was all kind of er and then was allowed to do I was still responsible for my tidying up the loose ends of my old job
B	yeah
A	which was where the other people were starting new jobs with clean slates I wasn't I was thrown into
B	so it needed a lot of work
A	me and
B	it doesn't get much more stressful does it
A	yeah I could have handled the work if the if the work hadn't changed
B	yeah
A	cos I did before erm because I had a solid you know you you stand on two feet and you kick one away you can potentially stand on one but if you kick both legs away
B	yeah you fall over
A	you've got no leg to stand on like er no er rudder no
B	and you're still not sleeping great?
A	er yeah I sleep fine as long as erm
B	you're exhausted
A	as long as I it's it's a mental thing
B	no yeah fine
A	so
B	but
A	he's moving out Friday
B	okay so
A	all his stuff's packed up
B	so this weekend?
A	yeah all his stuff is
B	so it wasn't the same weekend that we're moving out?
A	no
B	yeah I was confused about that
A	all his stuff all his er his er er he wouldn't have got the van anyway because the van's not big enough for him he's gotta get he's got a fridge freeze which has to be moved upright
B	no okay
A	no
B	what kind of van are we looking at here? like a transit van or?
A	yes a transit van yeah
B	you know if you see one as we go past
A	yeah
B	the same kind of dimension the same kind of size point it out to me
A	I I I think it's a normal standard transit van
B	that kind of thing?
A	like yeah like that
B	okay
A	with the with the
B	like that
A	no no not
B	not a truck a flatbed no?
A	no no erm he said barring incidents and accidents he said you know that suddenly I's only pull the van if like the ones they're using broke down at the last minute and they needed it otherwise we're selling it
B	yeah
A	it's had erm you know a new engine put in it it's er they've decided to launch it
B	so it should be running fine
A	well hopefully it's had a
B	um
A	they said it's burning a bit of oil
B	do you have to pay for that?
A	no
B	just the fuel costs
A	just the just the fuel
B	and you're happy for me not to come back up?
A	well no I'll take
B	I mean it's not a cost thing if you're worried about like cos it's
A	no it's no no
B	for some reason it's thirty-five pound one way
A	yeah
B	or forty pound return
A	yeah
B	so it's only like five pound more
A	yeah
B	I've already spent thirty-five quid so
A	yeah
B	if you need me to come up I can
A	no it it it was good for
B	if you don't then it's it's probably worked out
A	because it gave
B	yep
A	and er it's a
B	I mean if you leave fairly early then cos you'll have the van the day before I presume on Friday?
A	er I don't
B	Friday night
A	I'll have to I'll have to
B	yeah I don't know
A	so I
B	is that close?
A	I'm not sure how I erm there's a barrier to take it's not it's not an industrial estate where they they've got the company
B	oh right
A	erm so erm I've gotta nail it with with
B	I'm saying if you come down
A	and then we'll come back Saturday night
B	yep if you come fairly early then we can have food then
A	yeah
B	maybe even lunch and dinner
A	so
B	oh
A	we were at
B	had the
A	we had yeah
B	oh
A	er he will be round on Friday
B	cool
A	because er he's helping with the erm with the move
B	and
A	yeah
B	he'll be there for dinner?
A	er probably not tonight no I think he's doing something else
B	oh
A	he's not for the past while he's not been in for many meals and plus he's had like he's on some kind of a
A	I don't know what er I've lost I've lost track
B	ha
A	other that the diets and them moving on but I mean he does er he's only fat in his head
B	does he think he's fat then?
A	yeah cos you know he's fat in his head he's not fat anywhere else
B	does he still doing his like refereeing or whatever?
A	yeah he still does that he's he's getting stuff
B	is he getting paid for that?
A	yeah er but he doesn't do it as regularly as he used to
B	oh yeah
A	so er
B	yeah when's that?
A	er er October
B	oh so it's definitely going ahead
A	yeah I don't think he'll be fit enough for it but he hasn't trained so he's not going to be used to the altitude or the heat
B	no
A	not in Tanzania it's about five five degrees off the equator and it's at altitude
B	how much altitude? do you know?
A	it's probably about four five six thousand feet
B	feet into metres?
A	er er metres divide it by three
B	oh so about two thousand metres
A	yeah
B	so ha it might not be too bad actually I mean the altitude at two thousand metres isn't enough to
A	no
B	make you really short of breath
A	no
B	and it will probably just take the heat off from
A	yeah
B	the being on the equator
A	yeah
B	twenty to twenty-five degrees
A	yeah
B	kind of like a nice hot
A	yeah
B	summer's day in England
A	yeah
B	as you come down It will get it will get so it might be okay
A	yeah
B	it might be
A	I've just guessed the altitude all I know is it's a damn site higher than here
B	I mean I know Kilimanjaro is there isn't it
A	yeah that's
B	and that that goes up to about six thousand metres so
A	yeah
B	obviously there's some pretty big elevation
A	and
B	I wanna go there myself
A	right they're doing some they're I think they're um cycling something like about
B	oh wow
A	day after day after day after day and he hasn't done that kind of
B	no yeah I'm not
A	stamina training
B	that might be a bit
A	yeah I mean I cycle just under three miles I haven't done as much
B	yeah
A	and I'm a bit
B	hey you don't look er you don't look fat
A	oh no not physically
B	have you been losing it lately?
A	erm I got up to just under two just over two hundred pounds which is about fifteen stone roughly
B	yeah
A	but er
B	what's that in kilos? sorry I work in kilos now
A	er er yeah you work in kilos don't you yeah about erm
B	a hundred kilos?
A	no no not er that it'd be two hundred and twenty pounds about ninety kilos
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	so it's two point two pounds
A	yeah
B	to the kilo
A	yeah
B	you don't look too big
A	I don't think I've lost any more hair since you were last here
B	no
A	yes I think it er at the sides it's well it might be going grey
B	yeah definitely that's alright
A	I saw your mum the other day
B	oh yeah
A	and er er she obviously looked at me and thinks the same thing but I looked at her again you'll probably notice this yourself cos you don't see like us for a a length of time
B	and she looks older
A	and I thought round her eyes she's aged
B	yeah
A	she couldn't see my eyes cos I had these on
B	yeah
A	but er yeah yeah I thought oh I thought er er you've aged
B	I think we're all looking a little older now
A	well we the the we all all getting
A	really?
A	has she?
B	yeah she's gotten bigger
A	I dunno she used to be quite
B	yeah she's not slim now
A	what's she now?
B	she's like a Humpty Dumpty or something
A	yeah
B	she's this little round thing
A	that big
B	she'll lose it again apparently but
B	she's she's ballooned since I last seen her
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know it makes makes women barrel bodied
B	they're having a lot of problems with
A	I've heard something about
B	or heard from him or?
A	I mean
B	no he's he doesn't he doesn't talk to the cousins or their children basically at all
A	it's you mean his own children?
B	his own children yeah pretty much at all
A	has he like disassociated himself with them?
B	he's er yeah I mean she er like
B	so er just er they've had a falling out
A	her or them?
B	over the children yeah
A	yeah
B	so they're they're all quite annoyed about that
A	it's a it's a poor choice and and a bad choice when you put erm sex over
B	yeah
A	obviously he's
B	I guess he's a bit black and white
A	he's
B	thinks well I've done my duty and
A	yeah he's he's he's a bit hurt but then again he er he he
B	yeah
A	so they didn't have some support so I don't know
B	yeah
A	but erm when he married
B	it was
A	was er
B	yeah
A	that was all that he needed and perhaps
B	oh yeah
A	it's his children and his grandchildren
B	yeah
A	they want acceptance but erm it's a risk it's a risky game and and if it it it doesn't pan out with this woman
B	yeah
A	he's given it all back to
B	past indiscretions
A	her past indiscretions yeah because she's there
B	yeah I think they pretty much have by the
A	yeah but er yeah
B	they're much more on her side
A	he had the position and the er he just
B	yeah
A	now he's the
B	yeah I dunno why he's done that
A	no I I they said like no reason to I I didn't go and see him I well I I kind of I've tied all my all my ties are tied off
B	yeah
A	is she? I hear she's gone back to erm I think she must have been watching er erm Spartacus
A	where they are kind of er to you to paraphrase those words cock or cunt
A	and erm I think she's gone back to the former rather than the latter but I may there may be an update on that
B	no I think she just swings whichever way she wants to
A	do you mind if I wind the window down? is she living with someone or by herself?
B	I think she's living by herself as far as I can tell
A	right
B	she's going down er
A	she doesn't? why?
B	no
A	yeah I've
B	that he said anything to her or did anything they both used it as an excuse to
A	yes
B	not really communicate any more after that
A	I don't think erm
B	and
A	yes well there was always a connection between your mum and
B	they lived together didn't they
A	erm er no they never actually lived together but they
B	did you hear about
A	yes I did
B	yeah
A	yeah that was um yeah that was a bit sad
B	did you hear about erm
A	erm no
B	yeah massive guy
A	yeah
B	he erm hung himself while his child was he was with his child he said I'm just going out to the garage to get something
A	and found him
B	and found him still alive like
A	oh right
B	squirming on the on the the hangman's noose and er ran screaming to help people but when people came it was too late
A	no it's a terrible thing yeah
B	what a horrific thing to do
A	yes that would erm
B	I mean
A	just disappear yeah yeah
B	you know what I mean? don't do it in front of them
A	no
B	and you could even do it in such a way where they're not sure if you've if you've done it or not
A	yeah
B	maybe you just died or er something happened
A	must must have been a botch job because um hanging someone is I mean hanging er properly so that their neck breaks um you have to have to know you have to know what they weigh
B	tie the knot correctly
A	and yeah and calculate the length of drop because otherwise if you get it wrong there's a good and the drop's too long there's a good chance the head literally comes off
B	oh my god
A	which happened with one of Saddam when they were
B	Saddam yeah
A	when they were executing Saddam's lot
B	yeah
A	they did that to one of them
B	that's how I think he died yeah
A	he was a big guy he obviously it should have snapped his neck
B	maybe it did snap his neck and he was just jerking I mean afterwards or something
A	it would
B	so no movement whatsoever
A	yeah he wouldn't be able to move
B	is there no muscle reflex?
B	it was pretty dark
A	probably was eating his own face
B	yeah
A	he snapped his neck
B	yeah
A	he he did kill him
B	that's pretty dark
A	yeah I liked Hannibal
B	yeah it is good
A	I liked Mads Mikkelsen who plays him because we've
B	he was in James Bond wasn't he?
A	yes he was Le Chiffre in erm
B	the guy that bled
A	Casino Royale
B	out of his eyes wasn't it?
A	yeah Casino Royale Le Chiffre erm with the original with played by erm Anthony Hopkins you just see Hannibal as a as a intelligent manipulating erm person
B	no where is the psychology
A	whereas Mads Mikkelsen comes over as being very charming very well you know he's not but
A	he comes over as being incredibly er sane not insane
B	mm
A	yeah so he plays the part well
B	too sane mm
A	well yes and his presentation immaculately dressed
B	yeah
A	his cooking skills you know he has has passion in his work
B	yeah
A	yes
B	it's quite dark
A	yeah
B	and interestingly filmed as well
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	can you watch that one quick?
A	did you watch? yes I did yeah
B	no
A	no
B	I didn't think she would be
A	if
B	no
A	I can start off with something and go mm and then I think
B	give it time
A	give it give it
B	it's too graphic for her I would imagine
A	yeah
B	would she um be up for playing a game? I know she probably doesn't like Battlestar Galactica but she likes board games though
A	she likes board games she'll give it a I guess she'll give it a go
B	yeah if there's the four of us tomorrow
A	yes okay
B	it's a good four player game
A	okay er erm
B	yeah
A	no he hasn't
B	cos I said to him
A	no cos
B	oh I though he said he mentioned it
B	I've got a a friend's bought me a board game Battlestar Galactica
A	no he didn't mention that
B	you play on the on the Battlestar and you move around and do different things
A	okay
B	and one person is the Cylon but he's undercover so you don't know who the Cylon is
A	oh right okay
A	okay
B	like a good like three hours I'd say
A	okay did you watch erm Game of Thrones?
B	yes yeah
A	I'm on series four
B	you're not finished it yet?
A	no
B	no
A	I like Tyrion he's very good that little
B	yeah yeah Peter Dinklage his name is
A	he's good the I think he was in erm erm the film with erm
B	Bruges In Bruges yeah
A	and he was and erm erm what's he called? Collin Farrell gave him a karate chop
B	yeah I think you're right I've known about that in retrospect but I haven't actually seen it again
A	yeah yeah he's a he's a good actor
B	yeah he is good
A	no
B	no he's really good in that you'll see
A	yeah no I haven't seen it he has comes out with some great lines and given great lines to work with
B	yeah it's directly from the book
A	oh okay
B	I was very surprised when I read the book thinking how quotable it was pretty much all of the dialogue in the
A	is
B	especially in the third season's book
A	oh
B	the fourth season they started to deviate a bit
A	oh right
B	now they still use stuff from the book
A	yeah
B	but they've made more of their own stuff
A	yeah
B	but like the first two three seasons pretty much directly everything they said was directly from the book
A	yeah yeah yes yeah
B	no
A	and and in er series four it's really quite profane
B	yeah well
A	the the language got worse as the series went on
B	well it's I think because they've deviated
A	yeah
B	more from him
A	right
B	they were adding some I don't know what they're doing with the season actually because they've come to the point now I've read all of his books
A	yeah
B	there's about six thousand
A	right right
B	he's got two more books to come out
A	right
B	and he hasn't finished them and it takes him about five or six years to write a book
A	mm mm yeah
B	so at the minute he does as you can tell in the series they have different stories you follow different characters
A	but they're all threaded aren't they
B	yeah they're all threaded together
A	that's the clever part about it is they
B	yeah
A	er they're all heading to a a a point of of convergence
B	yeah
A	that's the good thing I like about it is that there's I wish I'd thought of it there's sort of all separate plots
B	yeah
A	but you know they're all tied by a single theme and a single they're all gonna end or meet
B	at a head point yeah
A	further in time
B	although quite a few of them die
A	yes
B	don't they yeah
A	right
B	Elina Stark or something married to the old Targaryen king
A	okay
B	and Ned er has been keeping this promise by hiding this son amongst
A	oh right
B	his own prodigy
A	oh right
B	erm when in fact he's not actually his son so that's
A	oh right
B	and George R R Martin has recently said that fans have actually got his ending correct
A	oh alright
B	but he hasn't said which fan theory it is
A	which
B	but he's grappling with whether or not he should change what happens in the book
A	yes
B	because he's apparently he's been been putting lots of subtle clues in about what where it's going
A	right
B	and so his fans have picked up a lot
A	yeah
B	the evidence and put it at that as the end or something
